Objectives
To investigate the association between self-reported urinary
incontinence (UI) and sexual health in a representative
sample of older people.
Subjects and Methods
Participants were community-dwelling women and men aged
50–90+ years from the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing
(ELSA) who reported any sexual activity in the last year. The
prevalence of UI was assessed both cross-sectionally (ELSA
Wave 6; 2012) and retrospectively over the preceding 8 years
(ELSA Waves 2–6; 2004–2012). Sexual activities, difficulties
and concerns were assessed using a validated Sexual
Relationships and Activities Questionnaire. The association
between UI and sexual health outcomes was examined using
weighted logistic regressions, with adjustments made for
demographic, health, and lifestyle factors.
Results
At Wave 6, 391 (20.0%) women and 141 (6.9%) men
reported ‘any UI’ in the last 12 months. Compared to those
without UI, women with UI reported declines in sexual
activity and arousal over the last year, and increased concern
about their frequency of sexual activity and ability to become
sexually aroused. Men with ‘any UI’ reported declines in
sexual desire, increased erectile and orgasm difficulties, and
were more concerned about these sexual functions compared
to men without UI. Differences in the patterns of association
with sexual health were seen, dependent upon whether UI
was reported as sporadic or persistent, and also with respect
to the duration of retrospectively reported UI.
Conclusion
Self-reported UI was associated with impairment in sexual
health in women and men, and mainly linked to recent
declines in sexual activity and function along with elevated
sexual concerns. Our findings highlight that the sexual health
of older people should be considered when managing UI.

Introduction
Urinary incontinence (UI), defined as the complaint of any
involuntary leakage of urine [1], is a common condition that
becomes more prevalent with increasing age [2]. Typically, UI
is categorised as stress UI, urgency UI, or mixed UI [3]. In
addition, overactive bladder (OAB) is associated with urinary
urgency, with or without urgency UI symptoms [4]. The
prevalence, incidence and natural history of UI have been
extensively reported in the literature [5–7], and correlates and
risk factors have been identified in numerous epidemiological
studies [8–11]. Although estimates are variable and not
consistently comparable between studies, the prevalence of UI
in women gradually increases through adulthood, with 9–39%
of women aged >60 years reporting ‘daily UI’ [2]. Data for
men consistently show a lower prevalence, with estimates
ranging from 2% to 11% for daily UI amongst men aged
≥65 years [2].
Whilst not life threatening, UI is associated with significant
morbidity and can have a marked negative impact on health-
related quality of life (QoL) and affect both psychological and
social well-being [4,9,12,13]. Sexual health and satisfaction are
increasingly recognised as positive indicators of QoL and
emotional well-being in both men and women [14–17].
Although previous studies have described the negative impact
UI has on older peoples’ sexual lives and satisfaction, they
have tended to be: focused on patients attending
genitourinary clinics [18]; based on small and/or single sex,
non-representative samples [19]; or have a limited battery of
questions assessing sexual health and satisfaction [13]. The
association between UI and sexual health amongst generally
healthy, community-dwelling individuals is less clear. A
recent case-control analysis using data from the multinational
European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition
(EPIC) study found that subjects with OAB and other LUTS
reported significantly lower sexual satisfaction, higher rates of

 depressive symptoms and erectile dysfunction compared with
demographically matched controls [13].
We used data from Wave 6 of the English Longitudinal Study
of Ageing (ELSA), a population-representative panel survey of
ageing, retirement and health in middle-aged and older men
and women living in England, to examine the association
between UI and sexual health. We hypothesised that
individuals reporting ‘any UI’ would have poorer sexual
health in terms of a lower frequency of sexual activities and a
higher prevalence of sexual difficulties and concerns,
compared to those without UI, and there would be a dose
severity between more sporadic vs persistent UI. We also
hypothesised that if such associations were seen they would
be attenuated, or perhaps fully explained, by
sociodemographic differences, poorer physical and
psychological health, and/or lifestyle factors.
Subjects and Methods
Participants and Study Design
The core data were from Wave 6 (2012/2013) of ELSA, a
nationally representative longitudinal panel survey of
community-dwelling men and women aged ≥50 years in
England [20]. Data collection consisted of a face-to-face
interview and self-completion questionnaires. The general
methods of data collection are detailed at: http://www.elsa-
project.ac.uk. A total of 7079 (67%) participants completed
and returned the paper-based Sexual Relationships and
Activities Questionnaire (SRA-Q). We restricted this analysis
to ELSA members who reported ‘any sexual activity’ in the
last 12 months, had complete UI data at Wave 6, and for
whom sampling probability weights were available (see
below), leaving 3805 individuals in the main analysis sample.
Item nonresponse was <1% for the sexual health variables
included here. ELSA Wave 6 received ethical approval from
the National Research Ethics Service Committee South
Central - Berkshire, UK, and all participants provided written
informed consent.
UI
Questions on current UI were asked as part of the face-to-
face interview during Wave 6. Participants were asked two
questions: (1) During the last 12 months, have you lost any
amount of urine beyond your control? (yes/no); (2) When
you had this problem, did it last for more than 1 month?
(yes/no). Those who answered ‘yes’ to the first question but
‘no’ to the second were categorised as having ‘sporadic UI’;
those answering ‘yes’ to both questions were categorised as
having ‘persistent UI’. Participants provided this information
at previous biennial waves of data collection (Waves 2–5), so
using the first question only (During the last 12 months, have
you lost any amount of urine beyond your control?) we
generated an additional retrospective variable categorising
those with ‘no reported history of UI’, ‘UI for ≤4 years’ or
‘UI for >4 years’.
Sexual Activities, Problems and Concerns
The ELSA SRA-Q included questions on frequency of sexual
activities, sexual functioning and difficulties, concerns about
sexual health, and changes in sexual health over the last
12 months. Table 1 summarises the items from the SRA-Q
used as dependent variables in this analysis. One question in
the SRA-Q asked about lifetime sexual experiences (5-point
scale: entirely opposite sex -to- entirely same sex) and this
was recoded into two categories; ‘entirely opposite sex’ vs
‘some -to- entirely same sex’. Participants completed the
SRA-Q in private and returned it in a sealed envelope. The
full range of sexuality measures assessed in the SRA-Q and
cross-sectional associations with demographic, lifestyle, and
health factors have been described previously [21]. The SRA-
Q instrument is freely available at: http://www.elsa-project.ac.
uk/documentation.
Other Assessments
During the face-to-face interview participants were asked
about their current living arrangements, the age at which they
left education, and whether they had a doctor diagnosis of
high blood pressure, heart conditions, arthritis, diabetes,
asthma, chronic lung conditions, or if they had ever suffered
a stroke or been diagnosed with cancer. A morbidity count
variable was also created categorised as: 0, 1, 2, or ≥3 chronic
conditions. Smoking status was recorded as ‘current’ or ‘non-
smoker’, and typical frequency of alcohol consumption over
the past year as ‘never’ or ‘rarely’ (never–once or twice),
‘regularly’ (once every 2 months–twice a week) or ‘frequently’
(3 days a week–almost every day). Depressive symptoms were
assessed using the eight-item version of the Center for
Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale (CES-D), with a score
of ≥4 indicative of likely depression [22].
Statistical Analysis
Analyses were conducted using STATA SE v14.2 (StataCorp,
College Station, TX). We used weights to correct for sampling
probabilities and differential non-response, including to the
SRA-Q, and to calibrate back to the 2011 Census population
distributions for sex and age.
Specifically, these weights accounted for: (i) the differential
probability of being included in the Wave 6 sample and (ii)
for non-response to the SRA-Q instrument (full details
available at: http://www.elsa-project.ac.uk). Logistic
regressions adjusted for age, partner status, number of
morbidities, age at which they left education, smoking status,
and frequency of alcohol consumption were used to

Urinary incontinence and sexual health in older people
 determine the association of both current UI status at Wave 6
(no UI, sporadic UI, persistent UI) and retrospective UI (no
reported history of UI, UI for ≤4 years, UI for >4 years) with
sexual activities, difficulties and concerns, separately by sex. A
confounder analysis is presented in Appendix 1, supporting
the rationale for the inclusion (or exclusion) of these
additional adjustment variables in the final logistic regression
models. Results were expressed as odds ratios (ORs) and 95%
CIs.
Results
Table 2 summarises the demographic, health, and lifestyle
characteristics of the Wave 6 analysis sample who reported
any sexual activity in the last 12 months. Women were less
likely to have left education beyond 18 years of age and
consumed alcohol less frequently, as compared to men (all
P < 0.05). Women were more likely than men to report
arthritis, whilst men were more likely to report high blood
pressure, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes (all P < 0.05).
UI status at both Wave 6 and retrospectively (Waves 2–6) is
shown in Table 3. Overall, 391 (20.0%) women and 141
(6.9%) men reported any UI in the last 12 months. Of those
women reporting UI at Wave 6, 169 (41.4%) reported
sporadic UI and 229 (58.6%) persistent UI; for men the
proportions were 67 (47.5%) and 74 (52.5%), respectively.
The prevalence of any reported UI at Wave 6 increased cross-
sectionally with age for both sexes (Fig. 1). A total of 3339
participants had complete retrospective UI data from Wave 2
to Wave 6, and of those women with any UI, 180 (50.4%)
reported UI for ≤4 years and 177 (49.6%) UI for >4 years;
for men the proportions were 92 (71.3%) and 37 (28.7%),
respectively. The mean (SD) ages of the no UI, sporadic UI
and persistent UI groups were: 62.9 (7.2), 64.1 (6.6) and 65.8
(8.1) years for women; 64.5 (7.7), 66.6 (9.6) and 67.2 (8.2)
years for men, respectively. The only statistically significant
age difference between groups was for the no UI vs the
persistent UI group for both sexes (P < 0.05).
UI and Any Sexual Activity
As reported previously, of the 6201 core ELSA members
(excluding partners who were aged <50 years) with SRA-Q
data, 53.7% of women and 77.7% of men reported ‘any’
sexual activity in the last year [21]. Although this analysis
was restricted to those individuals who reported any sexual
activity in the last 12 months, differences were seen between
men and women with respect to any sexual activity and UI at
Wave 6. Amongst women there was no significant association
between either sporadic UI (OR 1.29, 95% CI 0.88, 1.91) or
persistent UI (OR 1.27, 95% CI 0.96, 1.67) and the likelihood
of reporting any sexual activity in the last 12 months. This
relationship was different for men where, although no
significant association was seen with sporadic UI (OR 1.51,
95% CI 0.78, 2.93), those reporting persistent UI (OR 0.49,
95% CI 0.28, 0.87) were less likely to report any sexual
activity in the last 12 months compared to men without UI.
Current UI and Sexual Health (ELSA Wave 6)
Associations between current UI and sexual activities,
difficulties and concerns differed by both sex and whether UI

adjustment for demographic, health, and lifestyle factors,
compared to women with no UI, women with sporadic UI
reported a 50% reduced odds of frequent sexual intercourse
and a 74% increased odds of vaginal dryness. This group also
reported significant declines in their frequency of sexual
activities and their ability to become sexually aroused
compared to a year ago, and was more concerned about the
frequency of their sexual activities compared to women who
were free of UI. Compared to women without UI, women
with persistent UI reported a 56% increased odds of difficulty
achieving orgasm and a 69% increased odds of declines in

 frequency of sexual activities over the last year. The persistent
UI group were also significantly more concerned about both
the frequency of their sexual activities and their ability to
become sexually aroused.
Compared to men free from UI, men with sporadic UI
reported 126% and 101% increased odds of declines in both
their sexual desire and frequency of sexual activities over the
last year (Table 4). Men with sporadic UI were also more
concerned about their sexual desire and their frequency of
sexual activities. More significant associations were seen in
men with persistent UI where, compared to men without
UI, they additionally reported increased erectile and orgasm
difficulties, declines in their ability to have an erection, and
concerns about their current ability to have an erection.
Retrospective UI and Sexual Health (ELSA Waves
2–6)
Associations between sexual health and UI were related to UI
duration in both sexes. Women who reported UI for ≤4 years
had a 40% reduction in odds of frequent sexual intercourse, a
102% increase in odds of frequent masturbation, and a 92%
increase in odds of experiencing vaginal dryness compared
with women free of UI (Table 5). Women with UI for
≤4 years also reported significant declines in their frequency
of sexual activity and their ability to become sexually aroused
over the last year. The only significant association amongst
women with UI for >4 years was an increased odds of being
concerned about their current ability to become sexually
aroused.
Compared to men with no UI, those with UI for ≤4 years
had 70%, 79% and 80% increased odds of declines in their
sexual desire, frequency of sexual activity, and their ability to
have an erection over the last year, respectively (Table 5).
Men in this group also reported increased concerns about
both their current level of sexual desire and current frequency
of sexual activities. Significant associations amongst men with
UI for >4 years included a 65% reduction in odds of frequent
sexual intercourse and a 159% increased odds of reporting
erectile difficulties. Men with UI for >4 years also reported
increased concerns about both their current level of sexual
desire and current ability to have an erection.

 and men in England. Reported UI was most consistently
associated with greater declines in sexual activity and function
compared to a year ago, and concerns about frequency of
sexual activities and sexual functioning. Cross-sectionally,
significant associations between persistent UI and current
difficulties achieving orgasm were seen in both sexes,
although functional difficulties in women (vaginal dryness)
and in men (erectile difficulties) showed differential
relationships with sporadic and persistent UI, respectively.
Retrospective reports of UI showed broadly similar
associations with sexual health as seen cross-sectionally,
although women with UI for ≤4 years reported more frequent
masturbation and men with UI >4 years reported less
frequent sexual intercourse.
Our present findings build on previous work showing that UI
and other LUTS can have a marked negative effect on sexual
health and satisfaction. Using data from the population-based
EPIC study, Coyne et al. [13] found that OAB and other
LUTS had multidimensional impacts on older men and
women (mean age 54 years), including worse health-related
QoL, higher rates of depression, and decreased enjoyment of
sexual activity. The authors also found that higher rates of
erectile dysfunction and decreased sexual satisfaction were
most strongly associated with OAB plus voiding symptoms as
compared to OAB alone or OAB with UI alone [13].
Although the EPIC data included detailed self-report items
covering different aspects of UI, the questions about sexual
health were more limited than those captured in ELSA. In a
Danish survey of >7000 participants aged 40–65 years,
Hansen [23] reported that LUTS was independently
associated with erection problems and satisfaction with sex
life in men and sexual function in women. Similarly, Salonia
et al. [19] found that amongst a sample of Italian women
(age range 19–66 years), those reporting UI or LUTS also
complained of sexual dysfunctions in a significantly higher
number than a general, healthy female population without
urinary symptoms. Our present data extend the upper age
limits around one to two decades above that typically
included in other population-based studies, whilst also
capturing detailed information about sexual activities,
problems, and satisfaction.
Our present cross-sectional findings did not show a
consistent pattern of association between sporadic or
persistent UI and the frequency of sexual activities and sexual

Urinary incontinence and sexual health in older people
 problems in both women and men. More consistent
associations were seen for declines in sexual activities and
function over the last year, and concerns about sexual
activities and function. It was interesting that UI was
consistently associated with concerns about sexual desire,
frequency of sexual activities, and sexual function, particularly
amongst men. We do not know the relative severity of self-
reported UI in ELSA and it is possible that some participants
may not perceive their UI as severe enough to seek treatment.
In addition, we do not have any longitudinal data on sexual
health to clarify whether those reporting UI at Wave 6 were
more or less sexually active in the past than those reporting
no UI. Nonetheless, individuals with UI were more likely to
report greater sexual concerns and retrospective reports of
declines in sexual activity and functioning, if not so marked
impacts on current sexual activities.
The physiological, psychological and/or social mechanisms
linking UI and sexual health remain poorly defined and we
were unable to directly investigate them here. It seems likely
that common, coexistent risk factors are, at least in part,
mediating the observed associations between UI and sexual
health. For example, we found that depression was strongly
associated with both UI and poorer sexual health
(Appendix 1), and it is plausible that this in turn may be
partly driven by detrimental effects of UI on QoL due to
leakage, odour, anxiety, and embarrassment. Although we
were unable to define whether the observed associations
between UI and sexual outcomes were primarily due to
common risk factors, or if the experience of UI results in
sexual problems, these factors are likely to have important
ramifications in a clinical setting with regard to preferred
treatment options and optimal outcomes. For more explicitly
gynaecological/urological factors, ELSA has gathered self-
report information on hysterectomy, oophorectomy, and
diagnosed prostate cancer (but no measure of BPH).
However, additionally adjusting the logistic regression models
for these obstetric events or prostate disease (or dropping
affected cases) did not substantively change the reported
results (data not shown). We also found that including self-
reported lifetime sexual experiences (‘entirely opposite sex’ vs
‘some -to- entirely same sex’) in the logistic regression
models had no substantive effect on either the magnitude or
significance of the observed associations (data not shown).
A somewhat surprising finding with the present retrospective
data was that participants reporting UI for ≤4 years had a
higher number of significant associations with poorer sexual
health than those with UI for >4 years. This was particularly
evident amongst women, and perhaps reflects a ‘response
shift’ model of adaptation to illness, i.e., chronic UI, whereby
internal standards, values, and subjective perceptions of QoL
change over time [24]. Those individuals who may have lived
with UI for shorter periods of time (UI for ≤4 years) may
have had less opportunity to adapt it into their daily lives as
compared to those who had lived with UI for longer (UI for
>4 years) and, as a result, reported more sexual problems.
This idea of a response-shift paradigm was also supported, at
least in women, by the observation that declines over the last
year in the frequency of sexual activities and the ability to
become sexually aroused were only seen amongst women
reporting UI for ≤4 years. Additionally, whilst the cross-
sectional analyses support our first hypothesis that UI would
be associated with poorer sexual health in both women and
men, we did not consistently find that those individuals with
persistent UI had uniformly worse sexual health than those
who reported sporadic UI. It is plausible that sporadic UI
may be more reflective of new onset of UI problems,
although we were unable to define other pre-existing
characteristics, including personality factors that may have
influenced any response shift reflected in our analyses. A
further surprising observation was that women with UI for
≤4 years reported more frequent masturbation than those
with no UI or UI for >4 years. Although we can only
speculate that this also reflects a response-shift adaptation, we
can hypothesise that this reveals a short-term shift to more
solo sexual activities. Thus, ongoing sexual desires could be
met, whilst avoiding potential barriers to partnered sexual
activity related to embarrassment and anxiety. It is also
possible that the ‘UI for ≤4 years’ vs ‘UI for >4 years’
grouping is related to age of first UI incidence. However,
given the wide age range of the ELSA cohort we are unable
to definitively assess time of first UI incidence to examine if
earlier or later onset UI is differentially associated with
specific aspects of sexual health, and whether age cohort
factors (multiple chronic conditions, partner availability) also
influence these associations.
The ELSA study has unique positive features; the data were
derived from a large and representative community-dwelling
sample covering midlife to the oldest old, who were not
recruited explicitly to answer questions on their sexual health.
The ELSA dataset, however, presented a contrary limitation
compared to the EPIC study [13]; whilst we were able to
investigate a wide variety of sexual health outcomes we were
unable to draw more nuanced distinctions between
underlying UI aetiologies. The ELSA questions referred solely
to UI and did not attempt to differentiate between UI
subtypes (OAB, stress UI, other LUTS etc.). Further
exploration of potential differential relationships across
different subtypes of UI would require more exhaustive
questionnaire items than the ELSA schedule allows. However,
future collection of population-representative data including
UI typology, frequency and volume of urine loss, and
duration of UI would allow for a more thorough examination
of associations, not only with sexual function and satisfaction,
but also with QoL and ageing-related health issues. We were
also unable to meaningfully assess the degree to which self-
reported UI was reversible or persistent. This a potentially

Lee et al.
 important limitation, given that reversible UI may be caused
by distinct (but short-term) factors, such as UTIs or faecal
impaction, and in turn may only impact transiently on sexual
function. ELSA did not oversample ethnic (2.1% of the
analysis sample identified as non-White) or sexual minority
groups and the results presented here may not be
generalisable to ethnic minority, and lesbian, gay and other
groups who do not identify themselves as heterosexual. Our
present data were self-reported and, although the interview
methods have accepted validity [25] we cannot exclude
reporting bias. Those ELSA participants who chose not to
complete the SRA-Q may not have done so due to pre-
existing sexual problems and/or feeling that they were
‘retired’ from sex. The non-response weights will have partly
dealt with this, with weighting for non-response to the SRA-
Q directly accounting for the variation in response according
to demographic and health characteristics. However, these
weights would not have dealt with UI and/or sexual health
characteristics that were unrelated to the factors used for
weighting, resulting in our sample being potentially biased
towards more functionally and cognitively fit older people.
Our present data, therefore, may have overestimated the
prevalence of sexual activities, particularly amongst the
oldest-old, and potentially underestimated the prevalence of
UI and sexual problems. This latter point is of particular
importance when we consider that both UI and sexual health
are taboo subjects in society, and likely to be under-reported
[26,27]. Finally, the cross-sectional data preclude any
examination of the temporal nature of the observed
associations between UI and sexual health.
In conclusion, UI was negatively associated with aspects of
sexual health in both women and men, mainly influencing self-
reported declines in sexual activity and function, and elevated
levels of sexual concerns. Given the relatively high prevalence
of UI, particularly amongst women, clinicians should be aware
of the potential impacts on QoL and recognise that sexual
activity and satisfaction are key factors in this equation. Both
UI and sexual problems are likely to be under-reported by older
people, reinforcing the need to ask about sexual function in
clinical assessment, given the ‘taboo’ nature of both subjects.
An increased recognition of the comorbid relationship between
UI and sexual health could result in more inclusive treatment
options being offered to improve both outcomes, potentially
leading to more satisfying intimate lives.
