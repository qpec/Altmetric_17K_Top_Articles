ABSTRACT
Background. Obesity is a consideration in the pharmacologic
intervention for estrogen receptor (ER) positive (ER1) breast
cancer risk. Body mass index (BMI) and waist/hip ratio (WHR)
have demonstrated different effects on breast cancer risk in
relation to estrogen receptor (ER) status, but the results have
been inconsistent. Furthermore, the situation in Chinese women
remains unclear.
Materials and Methods. We conducted a case-control study
including 1,439 breast cancer cases in Northern and Eastern China.
Both ER and progesterone receptor (PR) statuses were available
for 1,316 cases. Associations between body size-related factors
and breast cancer risk defined by receptor status were assessed
by multiple polytomous unconditional logistic regression analysis.
Results. Body mass index and WHR were positively associated
with overall breast cancer risk. Body mass index was positively
associated with both ER1/PR positive (PR1) and ER negative
(ER2)/PR negative(PR2) subtype risks, although only signifi-
cantly for ER1/PR1 subtype.Waist–hip ratio was only positively
correlated with ER2/PR2 subtype risk, although independent
of BMI. Body mass index was positively associated with risk of
ER1/PR1 and ER2/PR2 subtypes in premenopausal women,
whereas WHR was inversely correlated with ER1/PR2 and

 positively with ER2/PR2 subtype risks. Among postmenopausal
women, WHR >0.85 was associated with increased risk of ER2/
PR2 subtype.
Conclusion. Both general and central obesity contribute to
breast cancer risk, with different effects on specific subtypes.
General obesity, indicated by BMI, is more strongly associated
with ER1/PR1 subtype, especially among premenopausal
women, whereas central obesity, indicated by WHR, is more
specific for ER2/PR2 subtype, independent of menopausal
status. These results suggest that different chemoprevention
strategies may be appropriate in selected individuals. The

Implications for Practice: The results of this study suggest that general and central obesity may play different roles in different
breast cancer subtypes, supporting the hypothesis that obesity affects breast carcinogenesis via complex molecular
interconnections, beyond the impact of estrogens. The results also imply that different chemoprevention strategies may be
appropriate for selected individuals, highlighting the need to be particularly aware of women with a high waist/hip ratio but normal
body mass index. Given the lack of any proven pharmacologic intervention for estrogen receptor negative breast cancer, stricter
weight-control measures may be advised in these individuals.
INTRODUCTION
Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women in
China and the fifth leading cause of cancer-related deaths
[1, 2]. The incidence of breast cancer in both urban and rural
areas of China has increased over the previous 2 decades,
resulting in great social and economic burdens [3]. This ever-
increasing trend highlights the need for and potential impact of
effective breast cancer risk reduction strategies, such as dietary
modifications and weight control. Moreover, pharmacologic
interventions for reducing the risk of breast cancer have been
adopted worldwide [4]. Tamoxifen is the first drug approved by
the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and recommended by
the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) for reducing
breast cancer risk in high-risk women, based on four phase III
clinical trials (NSABP P-1, IBIS-1, Italian, and Royal Marsden)
[5–9] that demonstrated risk reductions in breast cancer of
31%–67%. However, this risk reduction was limited to estrogen
receptor (ER) positive (ER1) breast cancers [10]. Despite
numerous clinical trials of selective estrogen receptor modula-
tors (SERMs) and aromatase inhibitors, no preventive interven-
tions have yet been shown to decrease the risk of ER negative
(ER2) breast cancer [10]. Considering the potential side effects
of long-term use of drugs [4], it is necessary to identify those
individuals at the highest risk of developing ER1 breast cancer,
who might thus benefit most from such treatments.
Pharmacologic chemoprevention of breast cancer is mainly
based on breast cancer risk determined by risk assessment
tools such as the Gail model [11], the National Cancer Institute
Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool (http://www.cancer.gov/
bcrisktool), and other validated models (e.g., Tyrer-Cuzick) [12,
13]. However, none of these tools can distinguish between
ER1 and ER2 breast cancer risk, and other risk-assessment
factors are therefore needed. Obesity is a well-known and well-
accepted risk factor for female breast cancer [14], especially
among postmenopausal women [15–18]. Obesity is also an
additional clinical consideration for the use of SERMs for breast
cancer prevention according to the ASCO guidelines [4].
Actually, obesity is a worldwide public health burden [19], and
was reported to occur in up to 50% of all breast cancer cases in
older women [20]. It has been estimated that the incidence of
breast cancer in the European Union could be halved by weight
control [21]. Importantly, several studies have suggested that
obesity, indicated by high body mass index (BMI), is more
strongly associated with ER1 than with ER2 breast cancer,
particularly among postmenopausal women [22–25]. These
associations were confirmed in two pharmacologic intervention
trials (NSABP P-1 and STAR) [26]. Conversely, another study
found a direct association between abdominal adiposity (indi-
cated by waist circumference [WC] and waist/hip ratio [WHR])
and ER2 breast cancer only [27], although this association has
not been well characterized or confirmed by other studies.
The association between obesity and breast cancer defined
by ER and progesterone receptor (PR) status among women
remains poorly characterized. We therefore conducted a case-
control study among women in Northern and Eastern China to
clarify the possible associations between both general and cen-
tral obesity and breast cancer risk according to joint ER and PR
status. We also conducted analyses stratified by menopausal
status, based on previous evidence of differing effects in pre-
and postmenopausal women.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Population
Inpatients with breast cancer were recruited from 21 hospitals
in 11 provinces or municipalities (Shandong Province, Hebei
Province, Jiangsu Province, Henan Province, Shanxi Province,
Liaoning Province, Jilin Province, Heilongjiang Province, Anhui
Province, Tianjin municipality, and Beijing municipality) in
Northern and Eastern China from June 2012 to June 2013. Han
Chinese females aged 25–70 years who were newly diagnosed
with histopathologically confirmed primary breast cancer were
included in the study. Exclusion criteria were as follows: diag-
nosed with recurrent or metastatic breast cancer; diagnosed
with other concurrent malignancies; or a prior history of cancer.
Controls were randomly selected healthy outpatients who vis-
ited the center for regular physical examinations. Controls were
matched 1:1 with cases from the same hospital based on the
following criteria: same age (63 years); and similar visiting
period (62 months). All controls were confirmed as having no
diagnosis of breast cancer, with negative findings on physical
breast examination, breast ultrasound scans, and mammo-
graphic screening.
All study participants provided written informed consent,
and the study protocol and procedures were approved by the
institutional review boards at the Second Hospital of Shandong
University and the other participating hospitals.

 Data Collection
All participants completed face-to-face interviews based on a
self-designed structured questionnaire, as described previously
[28], to gather information on the following factors: demo-
graphic characteristics, female physiological and reproductive
factors, medical and family history, dietary habits, lifestyle hab-
its, and breast cancer-related knowledge.With the exception of
the basic demographic information, all questions had multiple-
choice responses and attempts were made to quantify or cate-
gorize the answer choices (e.g., yes/no or 1/2/3/4). Current
weight, standing height, WC, and hip circumference (HC) were
measured, and BMI (weight [kg]/height [m]2) and WHR (WC/
HC) were computed from the obtained measurements. The
results of clinical examinations including visual examination,
palpation, and related diagnostic tests such as breast ultra-
sound, mammography, and blood tests, were also collected.
Medical and pathology records from the hospital where the
patient was originally diagnosed were reviewed to obtain infor-
mation on ER and PR statuses and other pathological results.
Both ER and PR status were primarily determined immunohis-
tochemically, and all the participating hospitals had national
quality certifications for pathological diagnosis. Following
ASCO/College of American Pathologists (2010) recommenda-
tions, ER positivity was defined as >1% of tumor cells with pos-
itive staining. Of the total 1,489 breast cancer cases, data on ER
status were available for 1,325 (89.0%) cases, data on PR status
for 1,358 (91.2%) cases, and joint ER/PR status for 1,316
(88.4%) cases.
Statistical Analysis
Breast cancer cases were grouped into four categories accord-
ing to the joint ER and PR statuses: ER1/PR1, ER1/PR2,
ER2/PR2, and ER2/PR1. The frequencies and percentages of
variables at baseline were calculated. Analysis of variance and
Pearson’s chi-square tests were used to compare differences in
frequency distributions between case and control groups and
across case subgroups.
Multiple polytomous unconditional logistic regression anal-
ysis was used to calculate odds ratios (OR) and corresponding
95% confidence intervals (CI) for body size indicators in relation
to breast cancer case subtype (ER1/PR1, ER1/PR2, and
ER2/PR2); ER2/PR1 cases were excluded from the final OR
analysis because of the limited number of cases (n5 21). The
following variables were included in the logistic regression anal-
ysis: height, weight, WC, HC, WHR, physical activity (yes/no),
and
menopausal
status
(pre-/postmenopause). We
also
extended our analysis by stratifying the results according to
menopausal status, because the associations of these variables
with breast cancer may differ between pre- and postmeno-
pausal women. We also conducted stratified analysis according
to BMI category (�24.0 kg/m2/>24.0 kg/m2) to determine if
central obesity indicators were independent of BMI.
Tests for trends were carried out by fitting ordinal values
corresponding to different categories, and multivariable polyto-
mous unconditional logistic regression was used to conduct
Wald tests to evaluate the heterogeneity of the associations
across breast cancer subtypes.
The database was established using EpiData 3.1 (The Epi-
Data Association, Odense, Denmark, http://www.epidata.dk),
as recommended by World Health Organization, and was
subsequently converted into SPSS 21.0 format. All statistical
tests were based on two-sided probabilities with p< .05 con-
sidered significant.
RESULTS
Frequency distributions of demographic variables and body size
factors for all participants are shown in Tables 1 and 2, respec-
tively. Among the 1,316 cases with clear joint ER/PR statuses,
885 (67.2%) were ER1/PR1, 112 (8.5%) were ER1/PR2, 298
(22.6%) were ER2/PR2, and 21 (1.6%) were ER2/PR1. Com-
pared with the controls, more breast cancer cases were from
urban areas (75.8% vs. 62.1%), were postmenopausal (34.1%
vs. 29.0%), and had an earlier age at menarche (14.00 vs. 14.59
years). Regarding body size-related variables, cases tended to
be lighter (61.50 kg vs. 61.64 kg), but have a higher BMI
(24.03 kg/m2 vs. 23.99 kg/m2), a larger WC (80.00 cm vs
78.43 cm), and a higher WHR (0.85 vs. 0.84). Age at breast can-
cer diagnosis (p5 .003), residence (p< .001), menopausal sta-
tus (p< .001), WC (p< .001), and WHR (p< .001) differed
across the four subgroups with known receptor statuses.
Associations between body size-related factors and breast
cancer according to joint ER/PR status are shown in Table 3.
Body weight, BMI, WC, and WHR were positively associated
with breast cancer risk for all cases. No differences in risk were
found across the three analyzed ER/PR breast cancer subtypes
in relation to body height, HC, age at menarche, or physical
activity. However, women weighing >62.0 kg had a 21%
increased risk (OR5 1.21, 95% CI: 1.02–1.45) of ER1/PR1
breast cancer and a 34% increased risk (OR5 1.34, 95% CI:
1.03–1.73) of ER2/PR2 breast cancer, compared with women
with a body weight <62.0 kg. Waist circumference was posi-
tively associated with risks of ER1/PR1 (p trend < .001) and
ER2/PR2 (p trend 5 .004) breast cancer. Women in the high-
est quartile of WC (>83.33 cm) had 64% (OR5 1.64, 95% CI:
1.27–2.13) and 77% (OR5 1.77, 95% CI: 1.23–2.56) increased
risks of ER1/PR1 and ER2/PR2 breast cancer, respectively.
Body mass index was positively associated with both ER1/
PR1 and ER2/PR2 breast cancer, although trend tests were
only significant for ER1/PR1 subtype (p trend for ER2/PR2
subtype 5 .093). Hip circumference was only positively associ-
ated with ER1/PR1 subtype (p trend 5 .027), with a 35%
increase (OR5 1.35, 95% CI: 1.04–1.76) in risk for women in
the highest quartile of HC (>100.33 cm). Waist/hip ratio was
only positively correlated with ER2/PR2 subtype, with a 64%
increase (OR 5 1.64, 95% CI: 1.23–2.18) in risk for women with
WHR >0.85. The association with menopausal status differed
between subtypes defined by receptor status (p< .001), with
postmenopausal status being correlated with increased risks of
ER1/PR2 and ER2/PR2 breast cancers.
We also investigated associations between body size-
related factors and breast cancer according to joint ER/PR sta-
tus in relation to menopausal status (Tables 4 and 5). Similar to
all breast cancer cases, body weight, BMI, WC, and HC were
positively associated with premenopausal breast cancer,
whereas no significant associations were observed for WHR
(OR5 1.01, 95% CI: 0.82–1.24). In contrast, only WHR was
associated with postmenopausal breast cancer risk, with a 54%
increase (OR 5 1.54, 95% CI: 1.14–2.10) in risk for women with
WHR >0.85. Among premenopausal women, the risks differed
across the three analyzed ER/PR subtypes for body weight

BMI, WHR, and Breast Cancer Risk by ER/PR Status

Downloaded from 
 (p5 .001), BMI (p5 .001), WC (p< .001), HC (p5 .045), and
WHR (p5 .026): body weight, BMI, and WC were positively
associated with ER1/PR1 and ER2/PR2 subtypes. There was
a 121% increase (OR5 2.21, 95% CI: 1.52–3.21) in risk of ER1/
PR1 breast cancer and a 105% increase (OR5 2.05, 95% CI:
1.18–3.56) in risk of ER2/PR2 breast cancer among women
with a BMI �28.0 kg/m2 compared with women with a BMI
<24.0 kg/m2. Among women in the highest quartile of WC
(>83.33 cm), risks were increased by 87% (OR5 1.87, 95% CI:
1.34–2.60) for ER1/PR1 and 152% (OR5 2.52, 95% CI: 1.56–
4.07) for ER2/PR2 subtypes. Waist/hip ratio was inversely cor-
related with risk of ER1/PR2 (OR5 0.51, 95% CI: 0.28–0.93)
and positively associated with risk of ER2/PR2 subtypes
(OR5 1.38, 95% CI: 0.96–1.98), although the result was only
significant for ER1/PR2 breast cancer. Unlike premenopausal
women, there was no difference in risk for any of the three ana-
lyzed breast cancer subtypes in relation to body weight, body
height, BMI, WC, or HC among postmenopausal women. How-
ever, the association between WHR and postmenopausal
breast cancer differed across the three groups (heterogeneity
test: p 5 .013), and WHR >0.85 was associated with a 125%
increased risk of ER2/PR2 breast cancer (OR 5 2.25, 95% CI:
1.34–3.80).
To clarify the value of central obesity indicators, we further
analyzed the associations with breast cancer after adjusting for
BMI (Table 6).There were no differences in risks associated with
WC, HC, or WHR across the three analyzed subgroups regard-
less of BMI. However, higher WHR was associated with an
increased risk of ER2/PR2 breast cancer, independent of BMI.
DISCUSSION
We carried out a case-control study including 1,316 breast can-
cer cases with known ER and PR statuses, and analyzed the
associations between body size-related factors and risks of dif-
ferent breast cancer subtypes. Both BMI and WHR were posi-
tively associated with overall breast cancer risk, supporting the
view that obesity, including general and central obesity,
increased breast cancer risk. However, the associations varied
for different breast cancer subtypes. Body mass index was posi-
tively associated with both ER1/PR1 and ER2/PR2 breast
cancers, although trend tests were only significant for ER1/
PR1 subtype, whereas WHR was only positively correlated
with ER2/PR2 subtype. Further stratified analyses showed
that the association between WHR and ER2/PR2 breast can-
cer was independent of menopausal status and BMI category.
These results indicated that general and central obesity had dif-
ferent effects on the risk of different breast cancer subtypes,
indicating the need to consider different chemoprevention
strategies for selected individuals, especially for those with nor-
mal BMI but high WHR.
The ASCO clinical practice guidelines for pharmacologic
interventions for breast cancer risk reduction [4] list obesity as
an additional clinical consideration for the use of SERMs. Based
on the post hoc analysis of the STAR and NSABP-P1 trials [26],
which showed no significant interaction among BMI, treatment
group, and the incidence of invasive breast cancer, ASCO guide-
lines reported that “there is no direct evidence to suggest that
women who are overweight or obese should not be offered
tamoxifen or raloxifene for breast cancer prevention.” How-
ever, the STAR and NSABP-P1 trials [26] only analyzed BMI and

BMI, WHR, and Breast Cancer Risk by ER/PR Status

 showed a stronger relationship with ER1 than ER2 breast can-
cer, whereas data on WHR and WC were not collected. Impor-
tantly, a meta-analysis [29] including nine randomized SERM-
based trials showed an overall reduction of 38% in the inci-
dence of only ER1 breast cancer, although 42 women needed
to be treated to prevent one case of breast cancer over a 10-
year follow-up period. These results suggest that it would be
preferable to be able to identify individuals at increased risk of
ER1 breast cancer, to optimize the benefit-harm balance.
Extensive epidemiological evidence supports a close associ-
ation between breast cancer and obesity. And with the increas-
ing trends in central obesity among adults with normal BMI
[30, 31], especially among Asian women, there have been sug-
gestions that central obesity may play a more important role in
breast cancer risk than general obesity [32]. Central obesity,
also known as abdominal obesity, is defined as excessive
abdominal fat around the stomach and abdomen [32] and is
indicated by WHR and WC, compared with general obesity,
which is measured by BMI [33].
Body mass index has been the most widely used indicator
for studying the association between obesity and breast cancer.
Extensive studies in Western countries have revealed positive
and inverse associations between BMI and breast cancer
among postmenopausal and premenopausal women, respec-
tively. The association between BMI and breast cancer also
appeared to be strong among Asian-Pacific women [20],
although few Asian studies have been carried out and the
results have been inconsistent [34]. In the current study, higher
BMI was correlated with an increased risk of breast cancer risk
among the overall population and among premenopausal
women, but not in postmenopausal women.This was in accord
with our previous case-control study based on a cross-sectional
epidemiological survey, which also showed a significant rela-
tionship between BMI and overall breast cancer risk [28, 35].
Similarly, a dose-response meta-analysis also supported a sig-
nificant positive association between BMI and premenopausal
breast cancer risk [36] among Asian populations. However,
another systematic review [20] based on prospective observa-
tional studies showed positive associations among both pre-
menopausal (risk ratio [RR]5 1.16, 95% CI: 1.01–1.32) and
postmenopausal (RR 5 1.31, 95% CI: 1.15–1.48) Asian-Pacific
populations, whereas two Japanese cohort studies [37, 38]
showed a positive association in postmenopausal women, but
no association in premenopausal women.
Kaaks et al. [39] and Mannisto et al. [40] reported that
WHR was a more specific indicator of breast cancer risk than
BMI, and other studies have shown a similar association in
other malignancies, such as prostate cancer [41]. However,
although several studies have indicated a relationship between
high WHR and increased breast cancer risk [42], the conclusions
remain controversial. In the current study, increased WHR was
related to elevated breast cancer risk overall and among post-
menopausal but not premenopausal women. In contrast, a sys-
tematic review and dose-response meta-analysis including 30
studies [36] showed that increased WHR was positively associ-
ated with premenopausal breast cancer (RR5 1.08, 95% CI:
1.01–1.16), especially among Asian women (RR5 1.19, 95% CI:
1.15–1.24). Nonetheless, Lahmann et al. [43] and Shin et al.
[44] found no significant association between WHR (body size)
and breast cancer. Inconsistencies also exist regarding WC.
According to our study, WC was positively associated with
breast cancer risk overall and among premenopausal women.
This was in accordance with Harvie et al. [45], who showed
that WC (as well as WHR) was specifically associated with an
increased risk of breast cancer among premenopausal women,
although this association among postmenopausal women was
abolished by adjustment for BMI. However, an updated meta-
analysis by Chen et al. [46] suggested that central obesity meas-
ured by WC, but not by WHR, was associated with modestly
increased risks of both pre- (RR 5 1.05, 95% CI: 0.99–1.10) and
postmenopausal (RR5 1.06, 95% CI: 1.04–1.09) breast cancer,
independent of general obesity.
These apparent discrepancies regarding the effect of body
size indicators on breast cancer risk may be partly due to differ-
ences in ethnic groups, regions, and study designs, but may
also reflect the nature of breast cancer as a sophisticated and
heterogeneous disease with a variety of histopathological and
molecular classifications. The most widely employed classifica-
tion, also determined by gene expression profiling [47], was
based on ER and PR expression of tumor cells. Epidemiological
studies have also indicated that associations between body fat
and breast cancer risk may vary according to ER/PR status [48].
Numerous studies have shown that excess endogenous
estrogen due to obesity are more closely associated with risk of
HR1 than HR2 breast cancer [48, 49]. In the present study,
higher BMI was related to increased risks of both ER1/PR1
and ER2/PR2 breast cancers among the overall and premeno-
pausal populations. However, there was an indication of hetero-
geneity between the risk estimates for subtypes, indicating a
weaker tendency toward an increased risk of ER2/PR2 sub-
types (48% vs. 68% among overall population, and 105% vs.
121% among premenopausal women), whereas no associations
were observed for either subtype among postmenopausal
women.This result was consistent with previous studies in dem-
onstrating a stronger association between obesity and ER1/
PR1 breast cancer [48, 50]. However, in contrast, most studies
also showed a positive association between BMI and ER1/PR1
breast cancer among postmenopausal women, and a negative
association among premenopausal women [48]. A pooled anal-
ysis of 12 population-based studies [48] showed that a higher
BMI in younger women (<50 years old) was correlated with an
increased risk of ER1 or PR1 tumors, but not triple-negative
tumors. It has been suggested that a higher BMI may increase
the levels of serum steroids and reduce the levels of sex
hormone-binding globulin [51], resulting in elevated overall lev-
els of bioactivated estrogens, which may in turn promote the
development of ER1 breast cancer through binding to ER.
The relationship between WHR and different breast cancer
subtypes defined by ER/PR status is also controversial. Waist/
hip ratio was positively associated with ER2/PR2 breast can-
cer risk with and without stratification by menopausal status,
but not with ER1/PR1 breast cancer risk among the overall or
subpopulations, whereas heterogeneity across tumor subtypes
was observed in both the overall and stratified analyses. Most
previous studies showed that higher WHR contributed to
increased risks of different breast cancer subtypes equally [50],
although others found no association with any subtype defined
by ER/PR status [52]. To exclude any effect of BMI on WHR, we
performed a further analysis after adjustment for BMI, and
found an equally positive association between WHR and ER2/
PR2 breast cancer among women with normal BMI compared
with overweight and obese women (BMI �24.0 kg/m2;

 OR 5 1.60, 95% CI: 1.06–2.40 vs. OR 5 1.60, 95% CI: 1.06–
2.42). However, importantly, the positive associations were still
limited to ER2/PR2 subtypes. Comprehensive consideration
of all these results suggests that the correlation between WHR
and ER2/PR2 breast cancer should be paid due attention.
Waist/hip ratio is also known to be related to increased insulin
levels and insulin-like growth factors [53] as well as reduced sex
hormone-binding globulin, which may stimulate tumor growth
independently of ER/PR mediation. Chronic inflammation and
visceral fat-related metabolic abnormalities such as elevated
levels of insulin-like growth factor-1 and hyperinsulinemia may
also contribute to this association [54–56].
Similar to the risk pattern for BMI, increased WC and body
weight both showed close positive associations with ER1/PR1
and ER2/PR2 subtypes among overall and premenopausal
women. However, unlike BMI, they showed a stronger associa-
tion with ER2/PR2 subtypes. This was in agreement with the
findings of Ritte et al. [49] and further supported the impor-
tance of central obesity in ER2/PR2 breast cancer risk. Further
studies are needed to reveal the potential mechanisms respon-
sible for the effects of general and central obesity on breast
cancer risk. These mechanisms are currently unclear, and inter-
linked molecular mechanisms have been supposed to be
involved in the pathogenesis [57]. Increased levels of free estro-
gens due to aromatization of adipose tissue, inflammatory
cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-a, interleukin-6, and
prostaglandin E2, insulin resistance and hyperactivation of
insulin-like growth factors pathways, and adipokines such as
adiponectin have all been reported to contribute to carcinogen-
esis. Furthermore, the differential effect of WHR on ER2/PR2
and ER1/PR1 subtypes suggests that the elevated risk of
breast cancer associated with central obesity may not be expli-
cable simply by the sex hormone hypothesis.
Increasing evidence suggests that ER1/PR2 breast cancer
may be etiologically distinct [58]. The current study found few
significant results for this specific subtype, except a negative
association between WHR and the ER1/PR2 subtype amongst
premenopausal women. However, the current and previous stud-
ies [50] have all had relatively small sample sizes for this subtype,
and further studies with larger sample sizes are needed.
To the best of our knowledge, the present study was one of
few to focus on the association between body size indicators
and breast cancer risk according to joint ER/PR status among
Chinese women. Nevertheless, this study had several potential
limitations. Firstly, it was a case-control study, and only included
body size-related parameters measured at diagnosis, and some
measurements such as BMI at young age, weight gain, and hor-
mone replacement therapy were not included for analysis. How-
ever, all the indicators reported in this study were recorded by
objective measurements rather than by self-reporting, thus
avoiding recall errors. Secondly, the sample size of ER1/PR2
and ER2/PR1 breast cancer cases was relatively small, thus lim-
iting the statistical power in these two subtypes. However, based
on the usual distribution characteristics of ER/PR expression pat-
terns, 112 ER1/PR2 cases represents a relatively large sample.
CONCLUSION
The results of this study revealed that both general and central
obesity contributed to breast cancer risk, but with different
effects on specific subtypes. General obesity, indicated by BMI,
is more strongly associated with ER1/PR1 breast cancer risk,
especially among premenopausal women, whereas central
obesity, indicated by WHR, is more specific for ER2/PR2
breast cancer in both pre- and postmenopausal women. This
result reflects the potentially complicated molecular intercon-
nections between obesity, especially central obesity, and breast
cancer beyond the effect of estrogens. Importantly, the results
suggest that different chemoprevention strategies should be
considered in selected individuals.
