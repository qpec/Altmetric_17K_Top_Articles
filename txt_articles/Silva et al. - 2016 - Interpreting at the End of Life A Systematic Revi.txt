Abstract
 Context—Language barriers can influence the health quality and outcomes of Limited English 
Poficiency (LEP) patients at end of life, including symptom assessment and utilization of hospice 
services.
 Objective—To determine how professional medical interpreters influence the delivery of 
palliative care services to LEP patients.
 Methods—We conducted a systematic review of the literature in all available languages of six 
databases from 1966 to 2014. Studies evaluated use of language services for LEP patients who 
received palliative care services. Data were abstracted from ten articles and collected on study 
design, size, comparison groups, outcomes and interpreter characteristics.
 Results—Six qualitative and four quantitative studies assessed the use of interpreters in 
palliative care. All studies found that the quality of care provided to LEP patients receiving 
palliative services is influenced by the type of interpreter used. When professional interpreters 
were not used, LEP patients and families had inadequate understanding about diagnosis and 
prognosis during goals of care conversations, and patients had worse symptom management at the 
end of life, including pain and anxiety. Half of the studies concluded that professional interpreters 
were not utilized adequately and several suggested that pre-meetings between clinicians and 
interpreters were important to discuss topics and terminology to be used during goals of care 
discussions.

 Introduction
The demographics of the United States have been changing throughout the years, with more 
than 60.6 million Americans (21%) over the age of five now speaking a language other than 
English at home.1 Of these individuals, approximately 25 million (41.8%) report speaking 
English less than “very well” or having limited English proficiency (LEP).
Language barriers contribute to worse health care quality and outcomes for LEP patients. It 
is well established that language barriers impede patient-provider communication.2–4 LEP 
patients have lower satisfaction with care, lower rates of mental health visits, and more 
problems with communication in the acute care setting.5–7 LEP patients are vulnerable to 
inadequate assessment of and poorly-controlled pain.6,8 Cultural and linguistic differences 
may influence how physicians assess pain in LEP patients9 and how LEP patients report 
pain.10 Language barriers also can lead to misunderstandings between physicians and 
patients and unnecessary physical emotional and spiritual suffering, particularly at the end of 
life.11
Effective communication, including delivering appropriate information and understanding 
the patient and his/her family, is critical to providing adequate palliative care and pain 
management.12 Among Latinos, language barriers lead to lower utilization of hospice 
services and inadequate bereavement services for family members of LEP patients because 
of a lack of both hospice literature in Spanish and Spanish-speaking health care 
providers.13–16 As physical symptoms rapidly change at the end of life, palliative care 
services are imperative even in the face of cultural and linguistic differences.13, 17
Professional medical interpreters reduce errors in message delivery and improve patient 
understanding and comprehension.4, 18–21 The Office of Minority Health (OMH) developed 
the National Culturally and Linguistically Appropriate Services (CLAS) Standards in Health 
and Health Care to improve the quality of care for LEP patients, which include a standard 
for timely access to language assistance for LEP individuals.22 The type of interpreter 
provided to LEP patients can influence the quality of care delivered.4 Professional 
interpreters have specific credentials and training to assure their competence.23 A study of 
Spanish-speaking patients showed that using professional interpreters leads to increased 
patient satisfaction compared to untrained ad hoc interpreters.24 Professional interpreters 
have been shown to improve clinical outcomes and patient satisfaction compared to ad hoc 
interpreters.4, 20, 21 Despite this, many health care facilities attempt to bridge language 
barriers by using ad hoc interpreters, such as family members of patients or bilingual staff 
who have not had their language skills assessed.25

 No previous reviews have assessed the impact of interpreters on the quality of care and 
outcomes at the end of life for LEP patients. We conducted a systematic review to 
understand the influence that interpreters have on communication across language barriers in 
palliative care, including goals of care discussions, family meetings, end-of-life care, and 
symptom management. The aim of the review was to narratively summarize the current 
literature, assess the quality of studies, identify gaps in the literature and provide 
recommendations for further research to reduce disparities in the care provided to LEP 
patients at the end of life.
 Methods
 Data Sources
We conducted a literature search of six databases: PubMed (1966 to January 2013), 
PsycINFO (Psychological Abstracts) via OVID (1966 to January 2013), Web of Science 
(1966 to January 2013), Cochrane (1966 to January 2013), Embase (1966 to January 2013), 
and Scopus (1960 to January 2013). The original literature search strategy had three main 
components: 1) cancer and end-of-life care; 2) medical interpretation; and 3) immigrant/
minority status, which were linked together with “AND”. For PubMed, the controlled 
vocabulary Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) was used. We searched for articles in all 
available languages. The search provided 6352 articles after removing duplicates.
 Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria
The following inclusion criteria was applied to each article: 1) the study population included 
LEP patients in need of or receiving palliative and/or end-of-life care from any provider or 
setting; 2) interpreter services were utilized by these patients; 3) there was either (a) a 
comparison of the interpreter intervention to a control group or another intervention or (b) a 
qualitative analysis of interpreter use in palliative care; and 4) there was an assessment of the 
outcomes of the interpreter intervention. Palliative care outcomes included goals of care 
discussions, completion of advance directives, symptom management, and prognostication 
discussions. Articles were eliminated without further review if they did not focus 
specifically on medical interpreting and the receipt of palliative care services such as 
symptom management, goals of care or end-of-life care (n=6246).
 Study Selection
For the purpose of this review, a person acting as an interpreter was defined as any person 
attempting to bridge language barriers for LEP patients. These included bilingual staff, 
professional interpreters, health educators and family members. A systematic title and 
abstract review was conducted by two authors (M.G. and A.Z.) using the PICO 
framework.26 Articles were included for full review if it was unclear from the abstract that 
they contained data on the outcomes of language-concordant palliative care. This resulted in 
38 articles for full review by four authors (M.S., M.G., A.Z., L.D.). During full review, an 
additional 27 articles were eliminated that did not focus on the impact of an interpreter on 
palliative care outcomes (Fig. 1). A total of 10 articles were abstracted and appraised. The 
variability in study design and wide range of interventions and outcomes examined made

 pooling of results, quantitative meta-analysis, and calculation of statistical correlations 
infeasible.
 Data Abstraction
At least two authors abstracted data from the remaining 10 articles. Each article had 14 
items extracted: study location, sample size, diagnosis, participants’ ages (including range, 
mean, and standard deviation), participant race and/or ethnicity, languages interpreted, study 
design, recruitment methods, type of interpreter, type of palliative service, study site, 
comparison groups, outcomes and results/major findings. One author (M.S.) reviewed all 
abstractions and registered any discrepancies between authors. These discrepancies were 
resolved by consensus among the reviewers.
 Quality Appraisal
There is great variability in the methodological quality of the literature regarding medical 
interpreting.3, 4, 20 In order to allow the reader to assess the quality of each study, all articles 
were systematically appraised. Randomized and nonrandomized quantitative studies were 
evaluated with the Downs and Black checklist. The Downs and Black checklist is a scoring 
algorithm that evaluates articles on reporting of external validity, bias, confounding, and 
power.27 We used the modified Downs and Black,28 which has a maximum score of 28. To 
contextualize the Downs and Black score, a previously published qualitative categorization 
was used to group articles according to their score: ≥20 very good; 15–19 good; 11–14 fair; 
≤10 poor.29, 30 For qualitative studies, an 18-question appraisal, created by the United 
Kingdom’s Government Chief Social Researcher’s Office, was used.31 This framework 
evaluated articles on their contribution to the literature, defense of the study design used, 
rigor in the studies’ conduct, and credibility of the findings. To complement the critical 
appraisal tools, we also abstracted data about the amount of training the interpreters received 
and whether the language skills of interpreters were assessed.
 Results
 Characteristics of Included Studies
The tables show the qualitative (Table 1) and quantitative (Table 2) studies that were 
included. All 10 of the included studies were from English-speaking countries. Half were 
conducted in the United States,16, 32–35 three were from the United Kingdom36–38 and two 
from Australia.38, 40 More than half of the studies (n=6) recruited patients in the hospital 
setting,32, 34–36, 39, 40 one recruited subjects from both inpatient and home hospice16 and 
three recruited from community organizations such as a local interpreter chapter or local 
physician clinics.33, 37, 38
Of the studies included, only two reported the type of training the interpreter had 
received33, 34 and, of these, only one reported whether the interpreter’s language skills were 
assessed.34 One study33 reported that all interpreters had 40 hours of training to become a 
medical interpreter and also participated in quarterly educational opportunities. The second 
study34 reported that interpreters were eligible to participate if they had passed the required 
state interpreter examination and thus, were certified professional medical interpreters.

 Among the articles, seven mostly focused on communication and comprehension of 
information32, 34–36, 38–40 and three on utilization of interpreters when providing palliative 
services.16, 33,37
The majority of studies (n=6)34, 35, 37–40 focused on the presence of interpreters in goals of 
care discussions, including code status and establishing a surrogate decision maker. Four of 
these studies also involved interpreters assisting with delivery of prognostic or diagnostic 
information32, 35, 36, 40 and one measured patient understanding of prognosis.39 Two 
articles38, 40 evaluated symptom management of cancer patients.
There were different populations focused upon in the studies: patients and/or their family 
members, clinicians, and interpreters. One study targeted clinicians caring for LEP cancer 
patients36 and two evaluated the practices of interpreters working with LEP patients at the 
end of life.16, 33 Two studied LEP patients and their families to evaluate their experiences 
receiving palliative care.32, 40 The remaining five34, 35, 37, 38, 40 focused on the experiences 
of patients, families and clinicians when palliative services are provided using professional 
interpreters.
 Type of Interpreter
Only one study was set in a place that did not have professional interpreters available for 
daily care and the study reported that LEP families were not notified of the availability of 
professional interpreters.32 The remaining nine articles were conducted in settings where 
both professional interpreters and a variety of ad hoc interpreters were available. Five 
concluded that professional interpreters were not utilized adequately, based on their 
findings.33, 34, 36, 37, 39 A majority of the articles (n=6) found that providers relied on family, 
including minors, to interpret important information about diagnosis and prognosis.16, 36–40 
In one of these, children were used as interpreters by eight different families studied, which 
led to burn out, maladaptive behavior, and truancy within the families.38 Another study 
demonstrated that family members were frequently being asked to interpret during 
bereavement counseling in the hospice setting.16 These studies concluded that having family 
members interpret was suboptimal because it led to poor communication and negative 
outcomes, including omission or alteration of information and emotional conflicts within the 
patient’s family.16, 32, 36–40
 Effects Related to Interpreter Use
Overall, the studies found that professional and bilingual staff interpreters improved quality 
of care for LEP patients receiving palliative services. One study showed that language 
barriers for Spanish-speaking patients influenced their access to hospice services, 
particularly bereavement care for their family members.16 In the same study, the majority 
(54%) of hospice bereavement coordinators surveyed acknowledged that more interpreter 
services were needed to provide comprehensive bereavement services to LEP families. One 
study suggested that the disparity between the amount of time that clinicians spend speaking 
with LEP families compared to English-speaking families implies that the LEP families 
receive less information.35 Several other studies demonstrated that, in the absence of 
professional interpreters, LEP patients reported worse pain and non-pain symptom

 management and their family members lacked understanding of the patient’s clinical 
information, including prognosis or diagnosis, and experienced increased stress about the 
patient’s clinical situation.32, 36–40
Three studies recommended that providers and professional interpreters have brief meetings 
prior to interacting with LEP patients to clarify topics to be discussed, terminology to be 
used, or if strict interpretation vs. additional cultural mediation is needed to improve 
communication during interpretation.33, 34, 35 Other studies focused on the importance of 
defining a clear role for the interpreter prior to family discussions about end of life to 
improve communication.34, 35 One of these studies found that clinicians demonstrated 
aspects of communication that conveyed support and concern during end-of-life 
conversations less frequently with LEP families because of the emotional and informational 
complexity of these family conferences.35 The majority (7/10) of studies concluded that 
improving access to and/or standardizing utilization of professional interpreter services 
could improve the quality of care provided to LEP patients at the end of life.33–37, 39, 40
 Study Appraisal
All quantitative studies had either a good or very good score on the modified Downs & 
Black checklist. The average Downs and Black score for quantitative articles was 17.5, 
which has been categorized in previous literature as “good.”29, 30 There was little variability 
in the Downs and Black scores, which ranged from 15–20 points. All of the studies had 
relatively small sample sizes and none of the studies were randomized controlled trials. All 
quantitative studies were cross-sectional. All qualitative studies were appraised as having 
credible findings. All of the qualitative studies addressed their original aims, justified their 
research designs, stated clearly how sampling and exclusion were conducted and adequately 
documented their research processes. Confidentiality and/or informed consent also were 
discussed in all of these studies. The qualitative studies all discussed their scope for drawing 
a wider inference and noted that the conclusions were not generalizable, as is the case with 
qualitative studies. Only one study did not clearly describe how data were analyzed.38
 Discussion
This review found a small number of studies that have assessed the use of interpreters for 
LEP patients at the end of life. The majority of the existing literature on palliative care for 
LEP patients comprises case studies, needs assessments, and descriptive studies. Studies that 
assess the impact of interpreter use on quality of family meetings, symptom management at 
the end of life and access to hospice services are lacking. Despite the large body of literature 
that demonstrates the positive impact professional interpreters have on the health care 
outcomes of LEP patients4, 19, 20, 21 and the detrimental impact that ad hoc interpreters can 
have,4, 20, 21, 24, 25, 42 our review showed that ad hoc interpreters commonly interpreted in 
palliative care. Family members were often used as interpreters to deliver information about 
prognosis, diagnosis, and assess symptom management for LEP patients at the end of 
life.16, 36–40 Particularly concerning was the frequency with which family members and, in 
one study,38 children functioned as interpreters to facilitate end-of-life discussions. We also 
found that studies in the palliative care setting did not provide information on interpreters’

 training nor on whether the interpreter’s English or non-English language skills were 
assessed. Several studies emphasized the importance of involving professional interpreters in 
discussions before patient interactions.33–35 The studies in this review incorporated the 
perspectives of patients, their family members, clinicians, and professional interpreters to 
provide a clearer understanding on how to approach end-of-life issues with LEP patients.
Research demonstrates that family members who interpret in the medical setting bring their 
own agendas and can become overwhelmed or uncomfortable by sensitive discussions such 
as death and dying.41–44 Moreover, compared to family members, fewer clinically 
significant errors in interpretation are found when professional interpreters are used.19, 45, 46 
The CLAS Standards discourage the use of family members or friends as interpreters and 
prohibit the use of minors as interpreters, as do most health care facilities. This is a critical 
patient safety issue that should not be ignored; some health care facilities have been sued for 
malpractice related to significant injury when family members were involved in poor 
communication.47 Federal regulations and many states require the provision of language 
services for LEP patients.48 Lack of enforcement of these regulations, limited resources, and 
lack of awareness from health care providers about the importance of using professional 
interpreters help explain the underutilization of professional interpreters in the care of LEP 
patients at the end of life.49, 50
The amount of training interpreters undergo is an important factor to consider when 
discussing prognosis, diagnosis or goals of care, and is understudied.4, 51 One study assessed 
the experiences of professional interpreters in end-of-life discussions and found that 
although most of the interpreters surveyed had experience and felt comfortable with end-of-
life discussions, only half reported that these discussions usually went well.52 This suggests 
that end-of-life discussions may be perceived as suboptimal by professional interpreters. 
Specific physician and interpreter behaviors such as cultural sensitivity, establishing trust, 
and effective communication skills are important determinants of how interpreters view the 
quality of these interactions,33, 52 which can influence the quality of end-of-life 
communication with LEP patients and their families. There is a lack of research on how 
interpreter training and physician or interpreter behaviors influence patient and family 
satisfaction and understanding during language discordant end-of-life discussions.
Our findings suggest that poor communication can be improved when providers establish a 
clear role for the professional interpreter and discuss the objectives of the patient interaction. 
Research has demonstrated that health care providers who are unfamiliar with the roles of 
professional interpreters and how to access them were less likely to use interpreters with 
LEP patients.19, 46, 53 A majority of interpreters in one study reported feeling that physicians 
needed more training on how to conduct end-of-life discussions through an interpreter.52 
Studies support the need to improve health care professionals’ understanding of the role of 
professional interpreters to improve the quality of communication for LEP patients.53–55 
Involving interpreters in discussions about the objectives of the patient encounter, including 
clarifying terminology, can improve the quality of the interaction between providers, 
interpreters, LEP patients, and their family members. Incorporating education on end-of-life 
discussions with LEP patients into clinician training programs is essential and currently 
lacking.2, 52, 56–58
Silva et al.

 A lack of understanding of LEP patients’ perspectives and how culture impacts the way 
illness is viewed can lead to misunderstandings and communication problems during family 
meetings.59–61 Assessing how palliative care needs differ by language and culture is another 
important gap in the literature.
This review is not without limitations. First, most of the included studies were either 
qualitative, had a small sample size, or were conducted at a single site, which limits the 
generalizability of the studies to patients from other settings, languages, countries or clinical 
contexts. However, the findings of both the quantitative and qualitative studies included were 
consistent with previous literature, which demonstrated that incorporating professional 
interpreters, rather than ad hoc interpreters, into clinical care can improve the quality of care 
for LEP patients.4 Second, many of the quantitative studies did not control for confounders 
such as race, ethnicity, or socioeconomic status, which also could have impacted LEP 
patients’ interactions with professional interpreters. Third, the majority of the studies did not 
report the type of training received by interpreters, which could correlate to the quality of 
communication. In the absence of this information, it is difficult to assess the true impact of 
the interventions described.
 Conclusion
Palliative care physicians need to have an increased awareness of the growing LEP 
population in the U.S.62, 63 as language differences can impact patients’ and families’ 
understanding of prognosis, medical decision-making and goals of care during family 
meetings. This literature review highlights the importance of appropriate, compassionate and 
supportive communication with LEP patients facilitated through professional interpreters if 
the provider does not speak the patient’s language. Palliative care clinicians must learn to 
avoid the use of ad hoc interpreters, especially family members, and how to work with 
professional interpreters. Best practices by palliative care clinicians may include having a 
meeting with the interpreter prior to the patient interaction for clarification of the agenda, 
defining the role of team members, debriefing with interpreters to provide support and 
improve interpreter and clinician satisfaction and being aware of how language and culture 
influence patient decision-making. Further research is needed to evaluate if these practices 
influence the quality of communication with LEP patients and families and the impact of 
professional interpreters on improving goals of care discussions, symptom management, and 
emotional support for LEP patients and their families. The field of palliative medicine needs 
to move forward with more systematic, high-quality clinical research in order to improve the 
quality of end-of-life care for LEP patients.

Three main characteristics were 
developed to provide high 
quality LEP communication in 
end of life:
○
physician specific 
– skillful 
communication, 
cultural 
sensitivity, 
acknowledgement 
of family in 
discussions, 
coordination of 
care with other 
providers
○
interpreter 
specific – 
advocate for 
patient and/or 
family, educator 
of cultural 
differences, 
acknowledgement 
of limitations
○
physician and 
interpreter 
specific – 
trustworthiness, 
compassion, take 
time to dialogue
•
Interpreters recommend pre-
meetings between clinicians and 
interpreters, including explicit 
discussions regarding strict 
interpretation vs. cultural 
brokering for improving quality 
of communication
