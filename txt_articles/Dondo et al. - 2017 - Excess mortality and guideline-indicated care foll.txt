Abstract 
 
Background  
Adherence to guideline-indicated care for the treatment of non ST–elevation myocardial 
infarction (NSTEMI) is associated with improved outcomes. We investigated the extent and 
consequences of non–adherence to guideline-indicated care across a national health system.  
 
Methods 
Cohort study (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02436187) using data from the Myocardial Ischaemia 
National Audit Project (n=389,057 NSTEMI, n=247 hospitals, England and Wales, 2003 to 
2013). Accelerated failure time models were used to quantify the impact of non-adherence on 
survival according to dates of guideline publication.  
 
Results  
Over 1,079,044 person-years (median 2.2 years follow up), 113,586 (29.2%) NSTEMI died. 
Of those eligible to receive care, 337,881 (86.9%) did not receive one or more guideline-
indicated intervention; the most frequently missed were dietary advice (n=254,869, 68.1%), 
smoking cessation advice (n=245,357, 87.9%), P2Y12 inhibitors (n=192,906, 66.3%), and 
coronary angiography (n=161,853, 43.4%). Missed interventions with the strongest impact on 
reduced survival were coronary angiography (time ratio 0.18, 95% confidence interval [CI] 
0.17 to 0.18), cardiac rehabilitation (0.49, 0.48 to 0.50), smoking cessation advice (0.53, 0.51 
to 0.57) and statins (0.56, 0.55 to 0.58). If all eligible patients in the study had received 
optimal care at the time of guideline publication, then 32,765 (28.9%) deaths (95% CI 30,531 
to 33,509) may have been prevented.

Conclusion    
The majority of patients hospitalised with NSTEMI missed at least one guideline-indicated 
intervention for which they were eligible. This was significantly associated with excess 
mortality. Greater attention to the provision of guideline-indicated care for the management 
of NSTEMI will reduce premature cardiovascular deaths.

Introduction 
Cardiovascular disease is the main cause of death in Europe, with coronary heart disease accounting for 
20% (1.8 million) of all deaths in Europe annually.1 Associated productivity losses, direct health care 
costs and informal care, due to mortality and morbidity, cost the European Union economy €60 billion 
a year.2 In America, non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and unstable angina 
are the leading causes of hospitalisation.3 Moreover, the global burden of NSTEMI persists 
despite substantial improvements in its treatment .4, 5 
 
Among patients hospitalised with NSTEMI, survival is better for those who receive timely 
guideline-indicated care.4, 6 A number of cohort studies have shown that improving adherence 
to evidence-based interventions reduces the risk of death after NSTEMI.7-9 International 
guidelines for the management of NSTEMI advocate a series of hospital-based interventions 
supported by evidence from trials and observational data.10, 11 Even so, a large proportion of 
patients fail to receive appropriate care. In a study of 5353 patients with acute myocardial 
infarction (AMI), optimal medical therapy was not provided to almost half .12 Another study 
of patients with AMI found that of those who were eligible for nine evidence-based 
interventions 50.6% missed at least one.13 
 
Thus far, however, studies concerning the relationship between mortality and care for AMI 
have been based on select cohorts, limited through non-contemporaneous, administrative or 
insurance–based databases.7, 12, 14 None has specifically studied NSTEMI, arguably the most 
vulnerable of AMI phenotypes,15 and none quantified the avoidable harm associated with sub-
optimal implementation of care across a single health system. Consequently, the excess death 
associated with the degree of non-adherence to guideline-indicated care for NSTEMI is not 
 5 
 
known. To address this, we used data from the UK national heart attack register (Myocardial 
Ischaemia National Audit Program, MINAP), which collects data from one health system (the 
National Health Service) including all hospitals in England and Wales.  
 
Methods 
Setting and design  
The analyses were based on data from MINAP, a comprehensive registry of acute coronary 
syndrome hospitalisations mandated by the Department of Health.16 The analytical cohort 
(n=389,057) was drawn from 441,945 patients with NSTEMI admitted to one of 247 hospitals 
between 1st January 2003 and 30th June 2013. Patients were eligible for the study if they were 
≥18 years of age. The discharge diagnosis was used to identify patients with NSTEMI. For 
patients with multiple admissions the earliest record was used (to reduce potential biases from 
previous treatment from multiple events). We excluded 31,321 (7.1%) patients because they 
died in hospital (and we could not, therefore, accurately ascertain their receipt of 
pharmacological therapies) and 21,567 (4.9%) patients due to missing mortality data (Figure 
1). Patient-level data concerning demographics, cardiovascular risk factors, medical history 
and clinical characteristics at the time of hospitalisation were extracted. Ethical approval for 
this study was not required under NHS research governance arrangements. The National 
Institute for Cardiovascular Outcomes Research (NICOR) which includes the Myocardial 
Ischaemia National Audit Project (MINAP) database (Ref: NIGB: ECC 1-06 (d)/2011) had 
support under section 251 of the National Health Service (NHS) Act 2006 to use patient 
information for medical research without consent. The study was conducted complying with 
the Declaration of Helsinki.

Guideline-indicated interventions 
The European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines for the management of NSTEMI and 
ESC Expert Consensus Documents were mapped to MINAP data to identify guideline-
indicated interventions as they became available over the study period (supplementary section 
1). Data contained information corresponding to the following 13 interventions: 
electrocardiogram, prescription of aspirin acutely, P2Y12 inhibitors at discharge, aspirin at 
discharge, beta blockers at discharge in patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction, 
angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) in 
patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction, a HMG CoA reductase enzyme inhibitors 
(statins), in-hospital use of aldosterone antagonist in patients with left ventricular systolic 
dysfunction and either diabetes or heart failure without significant renal dysfunction, 
echocardiogram, use of early invasive procedures (coronary angiography), smoking cessation 
advice, dietary advice, and enrolment into a cardiac rehabilitation programme.10 We used the 
adjusted mini–Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events (GRACE) risk score17 to categorise 
NSTEMI as lowest (≤70), low (71 to 87), and intermediate to high risk (>88) in line with NICE 
guidance.18 We quantified receipt of care only for patients who were deemed eligible for each 
treatment according to ESC guidelines. Patients were also classified as ineligible if a treatment 
was contra-indicated, not indicated, not applicable, if the patient declined treatment as recorded 
in MINAP or if the patient was hospitalised prior to the time the treatment was recommended 
by the guidelines.  
Survival analysis  
Multilevel accelerated failure time models were used to identify the association between 
missed guideline-indicated interventions and time to all-cause mortality (supplementary 
section 3). All models included a shared frailty term to account for clustering of patients within 
hospitals. Models were adjusted for case mix using the adjusted six-month mini–GRACE risk 
 7 
 
score and for baseline patient characteristics including: previous history of AMI, angina, 
diabetes, hypertension, peripheral vascular disease, a family history of coronary heart disease, 
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hypercholesterolaemia and previous coronary 
revascularisation. Missing data were imputed using multiple imputation by chained equations 
for missing GRACE covariates and a default imputation strategy based on clinical expert 
opinion implemented for selected treatment variables (supplementary section 2). Imputation 
results were checked for reliability and consistency using Monte Carlo estimates and through 
comparison with complete case analysis (supplementary section 3). Parameter estimates were 
expressed as time ratios (TR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) pooled over the 10 
imputations. A TR of ≤1 indicates reduced expected survival time and, therefore, worse 
survival associated with the missed guideline-indicated intervention.  
 
Excess deaths 
For each patient, a score was derived by dividing the total number of interventions received by 
the total number of interventions that the patient was eligible for. The score was categorised 
into optimal care (all interventions received) or not (sub-optimal care). Using optimal care as 
the reference, the dichotomised score was regressed on time to death/censorship. The resultant 
adjusted TR was multiplied by the one year mortality rate and by the proportion of patients in 
the sub-optimal category. The product was then multiplied by the total number of NSTEMI 
between 2003 and 2013 (supplementary section 4). As a sensitivity analysis, we used latent 
class analysis to model the interaction of all 13 guideline-indicated interventions on survival 
(supplementary section 5). Briefly, latent class analysis (LCA) is a statistical method that 
identifies underlying subgroups of individuals based on observed characteristics. Three 
subgroups of care (latent classes) were identified, which represented homogenous patterns of 
the probability of receipt of care. The classes were then regressed on time to death/censorship 
 8 
 
and the adjusted TRs multiplied by the one year mortality rate for the corresponding class and 
by the proportion of patients in that class. This figure was then multiplied by the total number 
of NSTEMI between 2003 and 2013.  
 
Results  
Of 389,057 patients with NSTEMI (mean age 70.9 (SD 13.3) years, 63.1% male, the majority 
(93.3%) were white, one third (31.5%) had angina and a quarter (24.9%) previous AMI (Table 
1). Over half (71.8%) were smokers ever/ current, 48.5% had hypertension, 20.9% diabetes 
and 14.6% had asthma or COPD. Over 2% of patients had an admission systolic blood pressure 
<90 mmHg. About half (56.8%) of all electrocardiographic changes were ST-segment 
deviation or T-wave inversion with 15.7% of patients having no acute changes. According to 
the mini-GRACE risk score, eight in ten patients were intermediate or high risk. 
 
Guideline-indicated interventions 
Only 51,176 (13.2%) patients received all of the interventions for which they were eligible and 
337,881 (86.9%) did not receive ≥1 guideline-indicated intervention. The most frequently 
missed were dietary advice (n=254,869, 68.1%), smoking cessation advice (n=245,357, 
87.9%), echocardiography (n=193,483, 49.7%), P2Y12 inhibitors at discharge from hospital 
(n=192,906, 66.3%), coronary angiography (n=161,853, 43.4%), and in–hospital aspirin 
(n=106,407, 45.0%) (Table 2). Figure 2 depicts the increase, from 2003 to 2013, in all 
guideline-indicated interventions, except for pre-hospital use of an electrocardiogram and pre-
hospital aspirin which decreased.  
 
Patterns of Care 
 9 
 
Using the latent class analysis, we identified three patterns of care and nominally labelled them 
‘high’, ‘intermediate’, and ‘low’. Patients in the high latent class were distinguishable from 
other classes by their high probabilities for receipt of P2Y12 inhibitors (0.72), 
echocardiography (0.60), cardiac rehabilitation (0.80), dietary advice (0.78), coronary 
angiography (0.69) and acute aspirin (0.65), and low receipt of ACEis/ARBs (0.01) and beta 
blockers (0.03) (Table 3). Whilst the use of electrocardiogram, aspirin at discharge and statins 
at discharge were also high in this group, these interventions were not distinguishing factors 
from the other latent classes. Patients in the intermediate class had a low probability of 
echocardiography and coronary angiography (0.43 and 0.38, respectively) and very low 
(<0.01) probabilities of receiving P2Y12 inhibitors, aldosterone antagonist, smoking cessation 
advice, and dietary advice. Patients in the low class had, in addition to the care probabilities of 
those in the intermediate class, very low probabilities of receiving ACEis/ARBs and beta 
blockers (0.01 and 0.03, respectively). Overall, there were only minor differences in baseline 
patients’ characteristics according to the latent classes (supplementary Table S38). However, 
class differences were most apparent by period of hospitalisation; 99.5% of those in the high 
receipt of care class were hospitalised between 2009 and 2013 compared with 0.5% 
hospitalised between 2003 and 2008.  
 
Survival 
Over 1,079,044 person years (median 2.2 years follow up, maximum 8.4 years) there were 
113,586 (29.2%) deaths, corresponding to 10.5 deaths per 100 person years. The median time 
to death was 1.1 (IQR 0.3 to 2.4) years. There was a significant difference in unadjusted 
survival between those who received optimal care and those who did not (Figure 3). After 
adjustment, time to death among patients who did not receive ≥1 intervention was shortened 
by 56% (TR 0.44, 95% CI 0.41–0.45) compared with patients who received all of the 
 10 
 
interventions for which they were eligible (Figure 4). Time to death was 16% shorter (TR 0.84, 
95% CI 0.79–0.88) for patients in the intermediate latent class and 23% shorter (TR 0.77, 95% 
CI 0.74–0.80) for patients in the low latent class compared with patients in the high latent class 
(Figure 4). Missed interventions with the strongest impact on reduced survival were coronary 
angiography (TR 0.18, 95% CI 0.17–0.18), cardiac rehabilitation (TR 0.49, 95% CI 0.48–0.50), 
smoking cessation advice (TR 0.53, 95% CI 0.51–0.57), and statins (TR 0.56, 95% CI 0.55–
0.58) (Figure 4).  
 
Excess deaths 
If all study patients with NSTEMI had received guideline recommended care for which they 
were eligible, then 32,765 (28.9%) (95% CI 30,531–33,509) deaths could potentially have been 
prevented. Similarly, 17,778 (15.7%) (95% CI 16,720–18,625) and 16,177 (14.3%) (95% CI 
15,547–16,807) deaths may have been prevented had patients from the intermediate and low 
latent classes received similar care to those in the high class.  
Discussion  
This study quantified the excess mortality associated with non-adherence to international 
(ESC) guideline recommended care for patients hospitalised with NSTEMI across a single 
healthcare system (the National Health Service of England and Wales) over the last decade. 
We found that if all patients during the study period had received the investigations and 
treatments for which they were eligible, according to the time of publication of the guidelines, 
then around 33,000 deaths may have been prevented. This equates to over a quarter of all 
NSTEMI deaths or about one avoidable death per month per hospital over the last decade.  
 
 11 
 
The care that was most frequently missed was dietary and smoking cessation advice, 
echocardiography to evaluative left ventricular systolic function, the prescription of P2Y12 
inhibitors, coronary angiography and the acute prescription of aspirin. We found that all of the 
13 care interventions if missed, except aldosterone antagonists, had significant and strong 
associations with reduced survival, in particular coronary angiography, cardiac rehabilitation, 
smoking cessation and the use of statins. Whilst we identified substantial improvements in care 
over the decade of study, in the latter years of study, a third of NSTEMI still did not receive 
treatments for which they were eligible. Moreover, we noted as we did in our earlier research, 
that patients who had low probabilities for receipt of pharmacological interventions also missed 
the opportunity to receive counselling interventions.13 
 
The management of NSTEMI is supported by rigorous data from many randomised controlled 
trials.10, 11 Advances in treatments for NSTEMI are reported in high impact publications and 
summarised in international guidelines, which are frequently updated as new evidence 
emerges.10, 11 The underlying assumption is that this evidence is then translated into practice. 
Internationally, this has been summarised by several registries which report temporal 
improvements in care 5, 19, 20 and a global decline in mortality from cardiovascular disease. The 
management of patients with NSTEMI, however,  is multifaceted and comprises a complex 
journey starting from a call for help to a range of hospital interventions and cardiac 
rehabilitation – hence many opportunities whereby care could be missed. Our investigation 
shows that national registry data allows higher resolution investigation of sequential care 
deficits significantly associated with premature cardiovascular death to be identified in a 
seemingly ‘well-functioning’ healthcare systems. Addressing these cumulative care gaps will 
save lives.  
 
 12 
 
We found that many care interventions were frequently not provided subsequent to their 
recommendation in international guidelines. In England and Wales over 40,000 people per year 
are hospitalised with NSTEMI – suggesting that the opportunity to reduce death following 
NSTEMI is determined by supply factors and not its demand – yet the national healthcare 
system studied did not appear to enable all patients to have an equal chance of receiving 
specialist cardiac investigations and treatments. The care most frequently missed was that with 
the greatest potential to reduce death; not receiving coronary angiography was associated with 
a reduction in time to death of 82% and not receiving cardiac rehabilitation of 51%, whereas 
not receiving smoking cessation advice was associated with halving of the time to death, and 
missing P2Y12 inhibitors a 24% reduction. In part, this is likely to be due to constraints around 
the availability of specialists and associated equipment, but also perhaps because of the 
heterogenic approach to the management of patients with NSTEMI – which compares with the 
management of ST-elevation myocardial infarction that10 for the NHS, is institutionally 
operationalised through a national primary PCI programme.21-23 By contrast, the decision to 
prescribe evidence-based medications or to proceed to coronary angiography is determined at 
the level of the physician in a non-emergent setting.  
 
Our labels of high, intermediate and low receipt of care aided interpretation of our latent class 
analysis. In reality, however, the classes were representative of more complex patient patterns 
of care rather than all patients receiving either high, intermediate or low levels of care.  Patients 
in the high class had low probabilities for receipt of ACEis/ARBs and beta blockers. Whilst 
this seems incongruous, these patients did not have left ventricular systolic dysfunction and, 
therefore, these pharmacological medications were not indicated. In effect, high latent class 
patients were healthier and more likely to receive evidence-based care and confirm findings 
 13 
 
from others who have shown that the patients who are most likely to receive guideline-
indicated treatments tend to be the lower risk patients.24-26  
 
This study has implications for international cardiovascular health. In line with the World 
Health Organisation Global Action Plan for non-communicable disease, we identify where in 
a modern healthcare system the provision of essential treatments is required to reduce 
premature death.27 Our results may, therefore, be extrapolated to other developed and 
developing countries which lag behind Northern Europe and North America in their provision 
of care28, 29 and where greater gains in cardiovascular health maybe realised. We clearly show 
that, across a modern healthcare system such as in the UK, there are substantial opportunities 
to improve outcomes through relatively simple measures: ensuring that all patients with 
NSTEMI receive appropriate guideline-indicated care. 
 
Our study has strengths in that it evaluates care across a single healthcare system, is population-
based and accesses a clinical registry designed specifically to evaluate quality of heart attack 
care. There are no other databases of comparable size, coverage and quality which include all 
hospitals within a country. However, our study has limitations. 1) We were reliant upon the 
accurate recording of data. 2) MINAP does not collect all cases of NSTEMI – our study was 
designed to study the impact of missed care at the level of the patient and not the numbers of 
NSTEMI hospitalised. We speculate that MINAP captures less than half of all NSTEMI in 
England and Wales; consequently, the number of preventable deaths that we report will be 
underestimated. 3) The deficits in care for smoking cessation and dietary advice may be inflated 
because advice about smoking and diet are implicit in cardiac rehabilitation programmes and 
there may have been preferencing by coders towards recording cardiac rehabilitation rather 
 14 
 
than counselling. 4) Missing data could have biased our estimates. We studied the nature of 
missing MINAP data and used, where necessary, imputation algorithms. The corresponding 
sensitivity analyses confirmed consistent results irrespective of the method adopted. 5) The 
investigation of ESC guideline-indicated care for NSTEMI was not able to extend to all Class 
1 Level A recommendations for the management of NSTEMI. Thus, it is possible that the 
deficits and their consequences are greater than we report. For example, we had insufficient 
data to study the prescription of anticoagulants. 6) It is probable that other factors beyond the 
hospital stay (such as drug adherence, number of cardiac rehabilitation sessions attended and 
primary care visits) may also have influenced survival. 7) We studied all-cause mortality, when 
non-cardiovascular deaths may not be attributable to missed NSTEMI care.30 8) Regarding the 
use of aldosterone antagonists, we found that application of the inclusion and exclusion criteria 
stated in international guidelines reduced the size of the exposed subgroup to such an extent 
that the resultant estimates were imprecise. 9) Although contraindication, refusal and non-
applicability information was available in MINAP, additional reasons for those recorded 
simply as not having received care interventions were not available. 10) This observational 
study cannot demonstrate causation, though optimal adjustment was made for confounders 
based on available information in the study dataset and informed by external information from 
other studies.  
 
Conclusion 
This first national study of the pathway of care for NSTEMI has identified substantial gaps in 
the provision of guideline-indicated interventions as recommended by the ESC. Such deficits 
in care, cumulatively, were significantly associated with many premature cardiovascular deaths 
when compared with patients who were eligible for and received guideline-indicated care – 
about a third of the deaths may have been preventable. Whilst cardiovascular care has 
 15 
 
substantially improved in modern healthcare systems with the resultant reductions in mortality, 
only though higher resolution investigations using whole healthcare system clinical registries 
can modifiable deficits of care be identified and, therefore, addressed.
