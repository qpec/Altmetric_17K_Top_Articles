Abstract
Background—Black men in the US have substantially higher prostate cancer incidence rates 
than the general population. The extent to which the incidence disparity is due to prostate cancer 
being more prevalent, more aggressive, and/or more frequently diagnosed in black men is 
unknown.
Methods—We estimated three independently developed models of prostate cancer natural history 
in black men and in the general population using an updated reconstruction of PSA screening, 
based on the National Health Interview Survey in 2005, and prostate cancer incidence from the 
Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program in 1975–2000. Using the estimated models, 
we compared prostate cancer natural history in black men and in the general population.
Results—The models projected that 30–43% (range across models) of black men develop 
preclinical prostate cancer by age 85 years, a risk that is (relatively) 28–56% higher than in the 
general population. Among men who have had preclinical disease onset, black men have a similar 
risk of diagnosis (35–49%) compared with the general population (32–44%), but their risk of 
progression to metastatic disease by the time of diagnosis is 44–75% higher than in the general 
population.
Conclusions—Prostate cancer incidence patterns implicate higher incidence of preclinical 
disease and higher risk of metastatic progression among black men. The findings suggest 
screening black men earlier than white men and support further research into the benefit-harm 
tradeoffs of more aggressive screening policies for black men.

INTRODUCTION
Prostate cancer is the most frequent cancer diagnosis and the second leading cause of cancer 
death in US men. Prostate cancer incidence among black men in the US is 60% higher and 
mortality is more than double the rate observed in white men.1
There is an extensive literature exploring likely drivers of the racial disparity in prostate 
cancer observed in the US. Regarding mortality, a persistent question concerns the relative 
contributions of differential access to care versus biology. Some studies2, 3 have suggested 
that differential access to care may partially explain the greater burden of adverse outcomes 
in black men. Others have identified differences in germline and tumor genetics between 
black and white men.1, 4–6 Black race has been identified as an independent prognostic 
factor for disease recurrence in multiple reports,7, 8 supporting a biologically more 
aggressive disease phenotype but also raising questions about disparities in surgery quality.9 
In general, black men are less likely to receive primary surgery,10–12 but the extent to which 
this observation is related to demographics, access to care, or personal preference is unclear.
At least one major driver behind the higher rate of prostate cancer deaths among black is 
their higher incidence of the disease. Taksler et al. concluded that the majority (76%) of the 
disparity in prostate cancer mortality may be explained by higher prostate cancer incidence 
in black men.13 The objective of the present study is to investigate and explain the higher 
observed incidence in black men. Whether this arises from a higher risk of disease onset or 
faster progression to an aggressive or symptomatic state is unclear. In their multi-ethnic 
study of UK men, Metcalfe et al.14 suggest that the latter is unlikely; however, they do not 
formally interrogate this hypothesis.
Understanding whether and how natural history might be different in black men is important 
because, if black men have a higher susceptibility to prostate cancer and/or a greater 
tendency to develop aggressive disease, it may be of value to consider different screening 
policies for them. This issue was first raised by Powell et al.,15 following observation of 
more aggressive disease characteristics and more frequent recurrence among black men 
following radical prostatectomy, and again16 based on a narrowing of prostate cancer 
survival disparities observed following the adoption of PSA screening in the US.
We previously studied the natural history of prostate cancer in the general population via 
statistical and computer modeling of latent disease onset and progression to clinical and 
metastatic states.17–19 By calibrating the models to observed population patterns of prostate 
cancer incidence before and after the advent of PSA screening, we estimated the risks of 
critical events in disease natural history and used these results to make inferences about 
potential impacts of different screening policies.20, 21

 In this article, we develop versions of our natural history models that pertain to black men 
and calibrate these using incidence trends in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End 
Results (SEER) program under updated PSA screening frequencies estimated specifically 
among the black population. We use the calibrated models to produce estimates of disease 
onset, progression, and diagnosis risks that pertain to the black population. We compare 
these risks with estimates for the general population (i.e., all races) to determine the extent 
to which the increased incidence among black men is explained by higher risks of disease 
onset, progression, or diagnosis. Finally, we use our results to examine differential incidence 
of clinically relevant disease, motivating further research into differential screening policies 
among black men.
METHODS
In this section, we describe the data and three models that we use to examine evidence of 
differential prostate cancer natural history in black men. We also describe a test for 
differences in black natural history relative to the general population and quantify the 
models’ goodness-of-fit after re-estimating key components of natural history.
PSA screening and prostate cancer incidence data
Because population-based PSA screening utilization was not tracked in real time, we 
retrospectively reconstructed PSA screening patterns in the US separately for black and 
white men in a previous study.22 Briefly, this reconstruction used responses to the National 
Health Interview Survey (NHIS) in 2000 to estimate the age at first PSA test, and 
longitudinal claims data from the linked SEER-Medicare database to estimate the 
distribution of inter-screening intervals. The present version of the PSA screening model 
updates the original version, incorporating responses to the 2005 NHIS as well as 
information on changes in disease-specific incidence following the advent of PSA (see the 
online supplemental information for a comparison of the original and updated PSA 
screening models).
We extracted prostate cancer incidence data from the SEER database before and after the 
introduction of PSA screening. Specifically, we extracted prostate cancer incidence for ages 
50–84, years 1975–2000, SEER historic stages local-regional and distant, tumor grade well 
or moderately differentiated (low grade) versus poorly differentiated or undifferentiated 
(high grade), and race categories “black” or “all races.” Missing information on stage, grade, 
and race was assumed to be missing at random and imputed as the most frequent 
combination of 20 logistic regression imputations using the mice package in R.23
Three models of prostate cancer natural history
We estimated three models of prostate cancer natural history using PSA screening and 
prostate cancer incidence data separately for black men and for all races. The three models 
were previously used to study effects of PSA screening on incidence and mortality trends in 
the general US population.24, 25
Briefly, the FHCRC model is a microsimulation model that links individual PSA growth and 
cancer progression. In this model, higher and increasing PSA levels are associated with the

 presence of latent cancer and shorter intervals to metastatic spread and clinical presentation. 
The MISCAN model is a microsimulation model that tracks progression through 
combinations of cancer stages and grades. In this model, advanced stages and higher grades 
are associated with potentially higher screening test sensitivity and shorter intervals to 
clinical presentation. The UMICH model is an integrated suite of analytic models that 
estimates transition probabilities from earlier to later stages and from lower to higher grades 
during the preclinical detectable phase. In this model, a later stage at onset, a higher grade at 
onset, and faster progression are each associated with shorter intervals to clinical 
presentation. In each model, screening potentially detects latent cancer at an earlier stage 
and/or grade. Key differences between models are the length of the preclinical detectable 
phase, how much early detection improves tumor characteristics, and how both natural 
history and screening effects depend on age. Detailed descriptions of the models are given in 
the online supplemental information.
A framework to explain incidence disparities
Sequential estimation—We first re-estimated natural history in all races using the SEER 
incidence and updated PSA screening data. Then, we substituted PSA screening patterns for 
black men and re-estimated natural history in black men following a systematic sequence of 
steps. Specifically, we re-estimated components of disease natural history, each containing a 
specific block of parameters. The blocks of parameters governed (a) risk of disease onset 
and initial tumor features, (b) risks of progression to metastasis and/or high-grade disease, 
and (c) risk of clinical diagnosis. At each step, the re-estimation involved identifying values 
of the natural history parameters that allowed the models to most closely match SEER 
prostate cancer incidence in black men. All models proceeded in this sequential fashion until 
final versions of the models were obtained that re-estimated all natural history parameters 
for black men. To evaluate sensitivity to this sequence of re-estimated parameters, a model 
selection exercise examined alternative sequences.
Natural history summary measures—Given the final versions of the models for black 
men and for all races, we summarized natural history in terms of the risks of preclinical 
onset, clinical diagnosis, and metastatic clinical diagnosis; mean ages at these natural history 
events; and mean years between consecutive events. Because all models were calibrated 
using data up to age 85 years, the summary measures were truncated at this age.
Testing and quantifying contributions to incidence disparities—We used a 
likelihood ratio test to evaluate whether re-estimating components of disease natural history 
significantly improved the models’ fits to the incidence data for black men. The likelihood 
used age at diagnosis as a survival time and was fit via a customized age-period approach.19 
To calculate likelihood ratio statistics, two likelihood functions were fit, one with and one 
without re-estimation of the component. While we report the likelihood ratio test results, we 
anticipate that, given the large sample size in the SEER registry, all tests will be highly 
significant at a traditional threshold. Therefore, we also report the improvement in the 
goodness-of-fit achieved by re-estimating components of natural history, with goodness-of-
fit expressed as the sum across years of the squared difference between annual model-
projected and observed age-adjusted incidence rates.

 RESULTS
Figure 1 illustrates the annual percentage of men ages 50–84 who received at least 1 PSA 
test by race and age group over the period 1988–2000 using responses from the NHIS in 
2005. Relative to previous estimates using responses from the NHIS in 2000,22 we find that 
younger men received fewer tests; these differences were similar among black men and all 
races. The updated screening patterns indicate that, relative to the general population, 
modestly lower percentages of black men received at least 1 PSA test in all but the youngest 
ages throughout the 1990s. The greatest racial disparities in PSA testing were in the oldest 
ages.
Figure 2 shows the results of re-estimating natural history for all races. The figure shows 
age-adjusted prostate cancer incidence rates per 100,000 men ages 50–84 reported in SEER 
by historic stage and corresponding model-projected incidence rates. Figure 2 also shows 
SEER incidence rates for black men and results of the sequential estimation of the models’ 
natural history components. The sequential estimation found that allowing the risk of disease 
onset to be different for black men provided an immediate improvement in the models’ fits 
to incidence in this population. Allowing the risk of progression to distant stage to be 
different produced higher distant-stage but similar local-regional stage incidence projections. 
Also allowing the risk of clinical diagnosis to differ in black men provided modest 
improvements to the fit in some cases (e.g., distant-stage incidence in the FHCRC model). 
Results of the model selection exercise described in the online supplemental information 
shows that this sequence for re-estimating parameter blocks reflects descending importance 
in the improvements in fits.
Improvements from re-estimating each block of natural history parameters were highly 
statistically significant from likelihood ratio tests (all P < 0.0001), and the final models’ fits 
to stage-specific incidence were substantially improved by re-estimation of the natural 
history components. The online supplemental information shows that sums of squared 
differences between observed and projected age-adjusted incidence rates declined 
dramatically once disease onset was re-estimated, confirming the relative importance of 
disease onset risk in explaining incidence disparities. All models obtained the best fits (i.e., 
smallest errors) when all parameter blocks were re-estimated.
Table 1 summarizes natural history measures among black men and for all races up to age 85 
years estimated by the three final models. In the general population, the risk of developing 
preclinical disease is 24–29% (range across models). In black men, however, these risks rise 
to 30–43%, reflecting risks that are (relatively) 28–56% higher than the general population. 
According to the models, the risks of clinical diagnosis in black men are (relatively) 33–70% 
higher than the general population; the corresponding observed risk in SEER prior to the 
advent of PSA screening was 53% higher in black men than white men (range 42%–62% 
higher) over the period 1975 to 1986. Among men who have had disease onset, the risk of 
clinical diagnosis is comparable for blacks (35–49% across models) and all races (32–44% 
across models), and this translates into sojourn times from disease onset to diagnosis that are 
very similar for black men and the general population within each model. However, among

 men with preclinical disease, the models estimate a 44–75% higher risk of metastasis before 
diagnosis among black men, reflecting greater risk of progression in this population.
DISCUSSION
The observation that prostate cancer diagnosis is more common and more lethal among 
black men than among white men has never been fully explained. Our study uses three 
models17–19 previously calibrated to US population incidence trends to learn about features 
of underlying disease onset and progression unaffected by differential practice patterns 
around prostate cancer screening and diagnosis. The model results consistently showed that 
the risk of onset of a preclinical prostate cancer explains a large majority of the observed 
incidence disparities. Further, in addition to the risk of onset, the risk of progression to 
metastatic disease before clinical diagnosis was higher among black men, but the risk of 
clinical diagnosis following disease onset was similar to the general population. The models 
cannot identify whether these apparent differences in disease natural history are driven by 
biology, behavioral, or environmental factors, but they are of value in generating hypotheses 
about underlying mechanisms and their implications for screening policies.
Based on these results, we conclude that black men have more preclinical and progressive 
prostate cancer than the general population. They are more likely to develop prostate cancer 
at a younger age, and they are more likely to progress to a metastatic state and/or higher 
grade before clinical diagnosis. Their higher risk of progression agrees with a previous study 
based on autopsy and surgical pathology data26 that concluded that black men had an earlier 
transformation to clinically significant cancer than white men. This study found similar age-
specific prevalence of prostate cancer among autopsies conducted in black and white men 
from the Detroit metropolitan area between 1992 and 2001. The study also found evidence 
of more aggressive disease in radical prostatectomy specimens from black men, consistent 
with their markedly higher incidence of metastatic disease at diagnosis. These findings led 
the authors to conclude that the risk of prostate cancer initiation did not differ by race, but 
the risk of disease progression was higher among black men. However, similar latent 
prevalence and greater metastatic clinical incidence of disease among black men is in fact 
only possible if latent incidence is also higher in this subgroup. For, if latent incidence is 
similar among black men but progression is faster, this would actually lead to lower latent 
prevalence at autopsy. Therefore, we conclude that the prior study results are in fact 
consistent with our finding that the risks of latent incidence and progression are likely both 
higher among black men.
Our findings motivate considering more intensive screening, e.g., beginning earlier and/or 
screening more frequently, among black men than among the general US population. To 
illustrate this, Figure 3 shows the cumulative incidence of “relevant disease,” i.e., disease 
fated to present before other-cause death. At all ages, the cumulative incidence is higher for 
black men than for all races. At ages 46–52 (range across models), the cumulative incidence 
among black men reaches the value estimated at age 55 among all races. Thus, if it is agreed 
that prostate cancer screening is worthwhile, and starting at age 55 is determined for the 
general population, our results suggest starting 3–9 years earlier for black men.

 We recognize that a consensus about general population screening is still lacking. The US 
Preventive Services Task Force27 recommends against routine prostate cancer screening in 
men of average risk, while the American Cancer Society28 recommends shared decision 
making around prostate cancer screening beginning at age 50 and the American Urological 
Association29 provides similar guidance with a starting age of 55. However, black men are 
not average risk and the benefit-harm tradeoffs of screening are likely to be different for this 
population.30
While starting at an earlier age is unlikely to impact overdiagnosis, other more aggressive 
screening policies, e.g., shortening intervals between screens or lowering the PSA threshold 
for biopsy referral, could increase risks of overdiagnosis.31 A comprehensive policy 
development process addressing whether and how best to screen black men will have to 
carefully weigh benefit-harm tradeoffs of candidate policies. Understanding race-specific 
natural history will be a critical pre-requisite for this important work. At this point, however, 
our findings support considering screening beginning at an earlier age in black men than in 
the general population. Powell et al.16 also recommend aggressive early prostate cancer PSA 
testing of African American men. Our work adds to theirs by illustrating one quantitative 
justification for an age to initiate screening in black men.
In practice, the policy development process will require going beyond examining incidence 
patterns to projecting mortality in the presence and absence of screening. Since screening 
benefit is contingent on access to efficacious therapies, benefits of screening in different race 
groups may be affected by any disparities in access to treatment and any racial differences in 
treatment efficacy. Future work will extend the models used in this article to project the 
downstream outcomes of different screening policies in black men under race-specific 
treatment distributions and efficacies.
Limitations of this study relate primarily to modeling assumptions and data limitations. 
While the use of multiple models provides some sense of robustness to the specific 
assumptions made, all models assume that disease is progressive. Thus, none of the models 
explicitly includes an indolent subpopulation, although each allows heterogeneity of disease 
progression with some cases progressing rapidly and others slowly. The FHCRC model 
allows the likelihood of developing high-grade disease to vary with age but does not model 
grade progression; the other models allow both grade and stage progression. Other 
differences across models are also driven by differences in the conceptualization of onset 
and how the risk of onset depends on age. In the FHCRC model, onset refers to the latent 
incidence of disease that would be detectable by biopsy, which can occur as early as age 35, 
while in the MISCAN and UMICH models onset refers to the latent incidence of disease that 
can be detected based on elevated PSA and diagnostic workup, and this rarely occurs before 
age 40. Finally, the PSA screening rates used by all models are based on a retrospective 
reconstruction rather than a prospective tracking of prostate cancer screening dissemination 
in the US population.
In conclusion, this study represents the first examination of how prostate cancer natural 
history must differ in black men to account for racial variation in patterns of disease 
incidence before and after the advent of PSA screening. We use observed patterns of disease

Three models were used to study differences in prostate cancer natural history between 
black men and the general US population. We found black men have higher prevalence of 
preclinical disease at all ages and higher risk of metastasis, supporting further study into 
different screening policies for black men.

 Figure 2. 
Age-adjusted prostate cancer incidence rates per 100,000 men ages 50–84 years for black 
men (black line) and all races (gray line) and corresponding projections by three models 
(colored lines). Model projections are based on the models estimated for all races combined 
with PSA screening in black men and sequentially re-estimating components of natural 
history to allow differential risk of onset of preclinical cancer (“Onset”), risk of progression 
to metastasis and/or higher grade (“Progression”), and risk of clinical diagnosis 
(“Diagnosis”).
