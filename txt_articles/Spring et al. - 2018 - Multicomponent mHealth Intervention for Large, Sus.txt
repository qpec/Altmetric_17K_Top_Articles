CONSORT-EHEALTH (V 1.6.1) -
Submission/Publication Form
The CONSORT-EHEALTH checklist is intended for authors of randomized trials evaluating web-based 
and Internet-based applications/interventions, including mobile interventions, electronic games (incl 
multiplayer games), social media, certain telehealth applications, and other interactive and/or 
networked electronic applications. Some of the items (e.g. all subitems under item 5 - description of the 
intervention) may also be applicable for other study designs.
The goal of the CONSORT EHEALTH checklist and guideline is to be  
a) a guide for reporting for authors of RCTs,  
b) to form a basis for appraisal of an ehealth trial (in terms of validity)
CONSORT-EHEALTH items/subitems are MANDATORY reporting items for studies published in the 
Journal of Medical Internet Research and other journals / scienti�c societies endorsing the checklist.
Items numbered 1., 2., 3., 4a., 4b etc are original CONSORT or CONSORT-NPT (non-pharmacologic 
treatment) items.  
Items with Roman numerals (i., ii, iii, iv etc.) are CONSORT-EHEALTH extensions/clari�cations.
As the CONSORT-EHEALTH checklist is still considered in a formative stage, we would ask that you also 
RATE ON A SCALE OF 1-5 how important/useful you feel each item is FOR THE PURPOSE OF THE 
CHECKLIST and reporting guideline (optional).
Mandatory reporting items are marked with a red *.  
In the textboxes, either copy & paste the relevant sections from your manuscript into this form - please 
include any quotes from your manuscript in QUOTATION MARKS,  
or answer directly by providing additional information not in the manuscript, or elaborating on why the 
item was not relevant for this study. 
YOUR ANSWERS WILL BE PUBLISHED AS  A SUPPLEMENTARY FILE TO YOUR PUBLICATION IN JMIR 
AND ARE CONSIDERED PART OF YOUR PUBLICATION (IF ACCEPTED).  
Please �ll in these questions diligently. Information will not be copyedited, so please use proper spelling 
and grammar, use correct capitalization, and avoid abbreviations.

"They used an app and accelerometer to track targeted behaviors and receive 
personalized remote coaching."
1b-iii) Open vs. closed, web-based (self-assessment) vs. face-to-
face assessments in the METHODS section of the ABSTRACT
Mention how participants were recruited (online vs. o�ine), e.g., from an open access website or from a
clinic or a closed online user group (closed usergroup trial), and clarify if this was a purely web-based
trial, or there were face-to-face components (as part of the intervention or for assessment). Clearly say
if outcomes were self-assessed through questionnaires (as common in web-based trials). Note: In
traditional o�ine trials, an open trial (open-label trial) is a type of clinical trial in which both the
researchers and participants know which treatment is being administered. To avoid confusion, use
“blinded” or “unblinded” to indicated the level of blinding instead of “open”, as “open” in web-based trials
usually refers to “open access” (i.e. participants can self-enrol). (Note: Only report in the abstract what
the main paper is reporting. If this information is missing from the main body of text, consider adding it)

"The 9-month RCT enrolled 212 Chicago area adults between 2012-2014 with low 
fruit and vegetable and high saturated fat intakes, low moderate vigorous physical 
activity (MVPA) and high sedentary leisure screen time. Participants were recruited 
by advertisements to an open-access website, screened, and randomly assigned to 
either of two active interventions targeting MVPA Simultaneously with (N=84) or 
Sequentially after (N=84) other diet and activity targets or a stress and sleep contact 
control intervention (N=44). They used an app and accelerometer to track targeted 
behaviors and receive personalized remote coaching from trained 
paraprofessionals. Perfect behavioral adherence was incentivized $5/week for 12 
weeks. Diet and activity behaviors were measured at baseline, 3, 6, and 9 months; 
primary outcome was 9-month diet and activity composite improvement."  
"Both Simultaneous and Sequential interventions produced large, sustained 
improvements exceeding Control (p<.001), and bringing all diet and activity 
behaviors to guideline levels. At 9 months, the interventions increased 
fruit/vegetables by 6.5 servings/day, 95% CI [6.1, 6.8], increased MVPA by 24.7 
min/day, 95% CI [20.0, 29.5], decreased sedentary leisure -170.5 min/day, 95% CI 
[-183.5,-157.5] and decreased saturated fat intake -3.6%, 95% CI [-4.1,-3.1]). 
Retention through 9-month follow-up was 82.1%.  Self-monitoring decreased from 
96.3% of days at baseline to 72.3% at 3 months, 63.5% at 6 months, and 54.6% at 9 
months (P<.001).  Neither attrition nor decline in self-monitoring differed across 
intervention groups."

"The average adult reports at least two chronic disease risk behaviors; 25% report 
three or more; and the magnitude of behavior change needed to bring each risk 
factor into compliance with public health guidance is typically large.[13-16] 
Unhealthful diet and activity behaviors are the most prevalent lifestyle risks. Fewer 
than 15% of U.S. adults eat �ve or more servings of fruits and vegetables daily; 
median intake is about half that amount.[17]  Only 29% meet dietary guidelines to 
consume less than 10% calories from saturated fats.[18-20] Half fall short of public 
health recommendations for moderate-vigorous physical activity[21, 22] (MVPA) and 
more than 50% exceed 2 hours/day watching television.[21, 23] These four 
behaviors associate separately with heightened risk of cardiovascular disease and 
cancers, and link with others that predict premature mortality."

"Inclusion criteria were willingness to be randomized, age 18-65 years, and met all of 
the following: <5 servings of fruits and vegetables/day; ≥8% daily calories from 
saturated fat; <150 minutes/week MVPA; >120 minutes/week of leisure screen time 
(i.e., television, movies, videogames, recreational internet. These discretionary 
activities were targeted because they can be decreased without jeopardizing 
necessary work-related activities). Exclusion criteria were unstable medical 
condition (i.e. uncontrolled hypertension or diabetes), pregnancy or intent to 
become pregnant, anorexia, bulimia, or binge eating disorder."

Open vs. closed, web-based vs. face-to-face assessments: Mention how participants were recruited
(online vs. o�ine), e.g., from an open access website or from a clinic, and clarify if this was a purely
web-based trial, or there were face-to-face components (as part of the intervention or for assessment),
i.e., to what degree got the study team to know the participant. In online-only trials, clarify if participants
were quasi-anonymous and whether having multiple identities was possible or whether technical or
logistical measures (e.g., cookies, email con�rmation, phone calls) were used to detect/prevent these.

"Inclusion of intervention components was guided by three principles – 
effectiveness, scalability, and synergy. Telephone coaching was used because it is 
more scalable than in-person counseling and has demonstrated effectiveness.[31, 
32] Since remote coaching produces smaller behavior changes than in-person 
treatment but larger magnitude changes are maintained better,[32, 33] we used 
modest incentives to maximize initial behavior change.[34, 35]  A smartphone app 
and accelerometer were used to provide diet and physical activity feedback 
synchronously to participants and their coaches, enabling connected, maximally 
personalized, adaptive coaching."

"The average effect size (mean difference in composite diet and activity 
improvement Z-score divided by common standard deviation) in our previous MBC1 
trial equaled 0.46. Based on our power calculations, we aimed to recruit 50 control 
subjects and 100 subjects into each of the two intervention groups, assuming a 
correlation of 0.50 for the composite z scores across time and an attrition rate of 
20% at the �nal time point. We powered the study for an effect size in the range of 
0.5 for the �rst Helmert contrast (H1: Simultaneous + Sequential versus control) and 
0.4 for the second Helmert contrast (H2: Simultaneous vs. Sequential). Bankruptcy 
of the mobile phone service provider necessitated the return and provision of new 
mobile phones, creating a budget shortfall that required reducing enrollment from 
250 to 212 participants: 84 allocated to the Simultaneous intervention; 84 allocated 
to Sequential; and 44 to Control. However, because the observed correlation of the 
composite z scores over time was smaller (r=0.44) than the predicted 0.50, the 
study remained su�ciently powered for the posited effect sizes. “

custom-built, intervention-speci�c study apps.[36] Each app prompted recording of 
only those behaviors the intervention targeted (i.e., dietary intake, sedentary leisure, 
and MVPA for the Simultaneous and Sequential conditions; stress, relaxation 
exercises, and sleep for Control). “

Study statisticians (DH, JS) generated the random allocation sequence.  Coaches 
screened and enrolled participants.  Coaches learned the participant’s treatment 
assignment at the same time as participants did (i.e., when participant downloaded 
the intervention-speci�c study app). Coaches were blinded to treatment allocation 
prior to the app download.

Specify who was blinded, and who wasn’t. Usually, in web-based trials it is not possible to blind the

"Intent-to-treat analyses of primary and secondary endpoints used 3-level linear 
mixed-effects models that treated daily measurements (level 1) nested within one-
week assessment periods (level 2) nested within subjects (level 3). Thus, we 
analyzed at the daily level and considered the correlation of the daily measurements 
within weeks and subjects by including random subject intercept and time trends at 
level 3 (subjects), and a random intercept at level 2 (one-week assessment periods). 
For comparisons across assessment periods, we treated baseline as the reference, 
and estimated changes at 3-, 6-, and 9-month follow-up. For comparisons between 
the intervention groups we used Helmert contrasts, in which the �rst contrast 
compared the combined Simultaneous and Sequential groups to Control, and the 
second contrast compared the Simultaneous to the Sequential group. We also 
included group by time interactions to assess the degree to which change from 
baseline varied for either of the Helmert contrasts at each follow-up. "

Our modeling approach was to use linear mixed models for longitudinal data. This 
class of models does not require that subjects are measured at all time points, and 
therefore can include subjects with missing data across time. All  randomized 
participants were included in analyses of primary and secondary outcomes.

No subgroup analyses were performed.  Additional analyses of treatment �delity 
and adherence were conducted as follows: 
"Three components of treatment implementation were assessed: �delity, receipt, 
and adherence. Fidelity was considered present for sessions when the coach 
delivered all required treatment elements correctly (e.g., encouraging a Control 
participant to go to bed earlier) and absent if the coach delivered any incorrect 
treatment element (e.g., encouraging a Control participant to exercise in order to be 
tired at bedtime). Treatment receipt was measured by the percent of scheduled 
coaching calls completed. Self-monitoring adherence was assessed by the 
proportion of days participant used the app and wore the accelerometer to track 
behaviors during 1-week assessments at baseline, 3, 6, and 9 months. Goal 
attainment was assessed by the proportion of weeks during treatment initiation 
when the participant met behavioral goals." 
"Baseline characteristics were compared across groups using ANOVA for 
continuous variables and chi-squared tests for categorical variables. The percentage 
of coaching calls received and completed in the �rst versus the second six weeks of 
treatment was analyzed using repeated measures ANOVA. The percentage of days 
participants adhered to self-monitoring was measured at baseline, 3-, 6-, and 9-
months and analyzed using repeated measures ANOVA. Goal attainment (yes/no), 
measured every two weeks during treatment initiation, was analyzed using mixed-
effects logistic regression with time modeled as either the �rst or the second 6-
weeks of initiation. All models of treatment receipt, adherence, and goal attainment 
included group by time interactions to assess differences between groups at each 
time point. "

Primary="These �ndings support the hypothesis that adults with multiple diet and 
activity risk behaviors can be activated to make and maintain large improvements in 
diet and activity behaviors by a scalable, multicomponent intervention that 
integrates mHealth technology, modest incentives, and remote connected coaching 
by trained paraprofessionals. Both active MBC2 interventions produced larger 
sustained improvements in fruit/vegetables, saturated fat, physical activity, and 
sedentary leisure screen time than those observed in most prior trials, including our 
MBC1 study, such that all four behaviors surpassed guideline recommended levels 
at the �nal study follow-up. Also, unlike the prior MBC1 interventions, both active 
MBC2 interventions yielded a sustained increase in MVPA documented by 
accelerometry."

20-i) Typical limitations in ehealth trials
Typical limitations in ehealth trials: Participants in ehealth trials are rarely blinded. Ehealth trials often
look at a multiplicity of outcomes, increasing risk for a Type I error. Discuss biases due to non-use of the
intervention/usability issues, biases through informed consent procedures, unexpected events.

"The study also had limitations. Three of four behavioral outcomes were assessed 
exclusively by self-report and could have been subject to demand characteristics. 
Fruit and vegetable consumption may have been overestimated and time spent in 
leisure sedentary screen time underestimated. However, although some risk of bias 
persists, the objective accelerometer derived measure of MVPA also showed large, 
sustained improvement following the active interventions. Although intervention 
bene�ts persisted through 9 months, longer duration follow-up remains needed.  A 
lack of sustained superiority of sequential over simultaneous treatment could have 
been caused by the fact that goal progression was time dependent, rather than 
mastery-based. The Sequential intervention added a physical activity goal at week 7, 
regardless of whether participants had achieved mastery of their fruit/vegetable or 
sedentary leisure screen time goals. It remains possible that Sequential treatment 
could have increased MVPA even more if the addition of this new target goal had 
been delayed until initial behavior targets were reached. "

“MBC2’s $5/week incentive for participants to meet behavioral goals during 
treatment initiation apparently had the intended effect of motivating participants to 
make large improvements. Notably, MBC2 participants made somewhat larger diet 
and activity improvements than those in MBC1, even though the MBC2 incentive 
was 2/3 smaller.  Moreover, no incentive to sustain healthful diet and activity 
changes was operative in either the MBC1 or MBC2 trial; nevertheless, behavioral 
improvements were maintained.  Hence, these �ndings contradict the worry that use 
of incentives followed by their discontinuation inevitably undermines behavioral 
maintenance.  Results accord with a growing body of evidence showing sustained 
improvements after incentives cease.[34, 35] Potential scalability of modest 
incentives is suggested by Centers for Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement of 
contingency contracting for some habit disorders, and by the growing number of 
individuals and employers that �nd incentives for healthy lifestyle change cost 
effective.[57] “ 
“Including behavior change coaching as a service provided by trained 
paraprofessionals or arti�cially intelligent agents could soon make technology-
supported behavioral interventions a scalable part of the health care system. “
