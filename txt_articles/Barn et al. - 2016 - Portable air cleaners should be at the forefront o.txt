Abstract
Landscape fires can produce large quantities of smoke that degrade air quality in both remote and urban communities.
Smoke from these fires is a complex mixture of fine particulate matter and gases, exposure to which is associated with
increased respiratory and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. The public health response to short-lived smoke events
typically advises people to remain indoors with windows and doors closed, but does not emphasize the use of portable
air cleaners (PAC) to create private or public clean air shelters. High efficiency particulate air filters and electrostatic
precipitators can lower indoor concentrations of fine particulate matter and improve respiratory and cardiovascular
outcomes. We argue that PACs should be at the forefront of the public health response to landscape fire smoke events.

Introduction
Fires in the landscape include both wildfires and con-
trolled fires, which are used for fuel reduction, ecological
restoration, land clearing, and agriculture. All landscape
fires create smoke pollution and have the potential to
affect human health, but most evidence on smoke ex-
posures comes from research on wildfires. These fires,
although episodic and generally short-lived, produce a
substantial amount of air pollution. Their smoke is com-
posed of fine particulate matter (PM2.5), carbon monox-
ide, nitrogen oxides, volatile organic compounds, as well
as compounds such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocar-
bons and benzene [1]. Fine particulate matter is consid-
ered to be the most health damaging component of
acute smoke exposures, which are typically character-
ized by monitored PM2.5 concentrations [1]. On very
smoky days, 24-h average PM2.5 concentrations can be
many times the World Health Organization guideline
of 25 μg/m3. Smoke from landscape fires can affect
communities in both rural and urban areas, sometimes
hundreds of kilometers from the source. Additionally,
exposures will become more prevalent as the global
climate changes and wildfires become more frequent
and intense [2].
Exposure to landscape fire smoke has important public
health impacts. Mortality and respiratory morbidity have
been the most frequently studied and most consistently
reported outcomes of smoke exposure. Smoke-affected
communities are at increased risk of all-cause mortality
and respiratory-related emergency room and doctor
visits, hospital admissions, and use of rescue medication
[3, 4]. Less literature is available on cardiovascular
outcomes, but recent evidence suggests that smoke ex-
posure is also associated with increased cardiovascular
mortality [5], hospital admissions for ischemic heart
disease [6], and out-of-hospital cardiac arrests [3, 6].
Emerging evidence also links wildfire smoke to reduced
birth weight, increased systemic inflammation, and bone
marrow effects [3, 4].
Public health authorities are often required to respond
to communities affected by wildfire smoke by providing
general advice and/or recommending specific interven-
tions. However, the public health response to smoke
events has been constrained by limited evidence [1]. Five
interventions have been commonly implemented: (i)
evacuation to less smoky areas; (ii) providing informa-
tion on N95 respirators; (iii) advising that people remain

 indoors and reduce physical activity; (iv) promoting the
use of portable air cleaners (PACs) to create private or
public clean air shelters in homes or large buildings with
well-maintained ventilation systems; and (v) augmenting
existing induct filtration for institutional settings [1].
Evacuations are stressful, and may not protect popula-
tions from smoke in the absence of direct threat from
fire [7]. Respirator use is cumbersome and requires
proper fit to be effective. The protection offered by
staying indoors largely depends on building construc-
tion and the infiltration of outdoor air. Large indoor
spaces may allow for dilution of smoke, and may have
induct filtration as part of their ventilation systems.
However, the utility of taking refuge in large indoor
spaces for exposure reduction has not been evaluated
during high pollution events [1]. On the other hand, a
growing body of evidence suggests PACs are effective
during such events [8].
We scanned the websites of eight North American
public health authorities located in areas commonly im-
pacted by wildfire smoke to review recommendations
made during smoke events (Table 1). Although seven of
the sites recommended PAC use, the level of informa-
tion provided to the public varied widely. Among au-
thorities recommending PAC use, advice ranged from
specifying the type of air cleaner to use to simply stating
“if you have room air cleaners, turn them on.” Few pro-
vided accompanying advice, such as the need to ensure
proper sizing of the unit and limit airflow into the room
or home. Public health recommendations on PAC use in
both private and public clean air shelters should be
stronger and provide specific guidance to maximize the
effectiveness of this important intervention. Here we de-
fine private shelters as any building that would normally
have restricted access (e.g. homes and residential care fa-
cilities), and public shelters as any building that would
normally be accessible to the general public (e.g. com-
munity centers, shopping malls, and libraries).
In 2014, the British Columbia Centre for Disease
Control published Guidance for Public Health Decision
Making During Wildfire Smoke Events, which incorpo-
rated evidence reviews on the five most commonly im-
plemented interventions listed above [1]. The aim of the
document was to provide public health decision makers
in British Columbia with a summary of the current
evidence. Here we provide a synopsis of the evidence re-
view on the use of PACs in private and public clean air
shelters for a larger public health audience. Given the se-
verity of recent wildfire seasons worldwide and the
proven benefits of PAC use in high PM environments,
we argue that PACs should be an integral part of the
public health response to smoke events.
Portable air cleaners
We define PACs as portable units equipped with high ef-
ficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters or electrostatic
precipitators [8]. Portable units are designed to clean air
in a single room, although some studies show reductions
in whole house PM2.5 concentrations [9]. Both HEPA
units and electrostatic precipitators target PM2.5: HEPA
units use mechanical suction to pull air across a high
efficiency filter, and electrostatic precipitators charge an
incoming stream of particles and collect them on an op-
positely charged metal plate. There has been limited
evaluation of induct filters, but we include some discus-
sion of their use.
Portable air cleaners reduce indoor particulate matter
Two studies have assessed the impact of PAC use on resi-
dential indoor PM2.5 during wildfire events. Henderson et
al. [9] compared indoor PM2.5 concentrations in two
homes operating two or three electronic precipitators with

 two control homes that had no PACs. Sampling occurred
over 24 to 48 h periods during wildfire events. Authors re-
ported 63 to 88% lower PM2.5 concentrations in homes
with PACs [9]. Barn et al. [10] investigated the impact of
HEPA filters on infiltration efficiency, a measure of the
contribution of outdoor PM2.5 to indoor concentrations.
One PAC was operated in each home. Sampling occurred
over consecutive 48-h periods when homes were impacted
by smoke from wildfires or residential wood burning [10].
The study used a randomized crossover design, in which
the HEPA filter was in place during one 24-h period and
removed (control period) during the other 24-h period,
with the order of filtration and control period selected
randomly [10]. Among homes impacted by wildfire smoke
(n = 13), a lower mean infiltration efficiency (± standard
deviation) was found for filtration (19% ± 20%) compared
with control (61% ± 27%) periods [10].
Most studies of PAC efficacy have assessed indoor
PM2.5 from residential wood burning, traffic-related air
pollution, or environmental tobacco smoke [8]. Many of
these studies have used the same randomized design de-
scribed above, which is considered the best way to evalu-
ate interventions in health research. These studies show
that PACs can reduce indoor PM2.5 concentrations by
32–88%, with most of this variability being attributed to
differences in study design, including the number of
units used, the study duration, and the airflow in the
room/home.
Few studies have investigated PAC use in very high pol-
lution settings. Chen et al. [11] reported a 57% reduction
in indoor PM2.5 concentrations with HEPA filter PAC use
in college dormitories located in Shanghai, China, where
mean indoor concentrations were 96.2 (25.8) μg/m3 dur-
ing the control period and outdoor concentrations were
102 (11.7) μg/m3. We are conducting a randomized con-
trolled trial to assess HEPA filter use and fetal growth in
Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia, where residential coal burning re-
sults in average wintertime outdoor PM2.5 concentrations
of 250 μg/m3 [12]. Preliminary results show that PACs can
reduce indoor PM2.5 concentrations by approximately
26%, on average (unpublished data).
Potential health benefits
Two studies have investigated the potential health bene-
fits of PAC use during wildfires. Mott et al. [13] exam-
ined respiratory symptoms and interventions among
residents of the Hoopa Valley National Indian Reserva-
tion in California during a wildfire that was active from
August 23 to November 3, 1999. Residents were sur-
veyed about their respiratory symptoms before, during,
and after the event, and about their use of four targeted
interventions: portable HEPA filter air cleaners; public
service announcements; face masks (N95 and non-
filtered); and hotel vouchers to facilitate evacuation. The
distribution of PACs and hotel vouchers was prioritized
among those with pre-existing conditions. Ninety-eight
participants (34%) reported using PACs for an average of
19.2 (95% CI: 17.8, 20.7) hours a day on 14.9 (95% CI:
11.8, 18.1) days during the smoke event. Increased dur-
ation of PAC use was associated with decreased odds of
reporting worsening respiratory symptoms (OR = 0.54,
confidence interval not reported). Null effects were
found for mask use and evacuation [13]. Authors noted
that approximately half of the PAC users operated the
units during the 3 days when PM10 concentrations were
highest, while only 17% of those using hotel vouchers
had evacuated the area during this same period. The in-
ability to take time away from work was reported as the
main reason for residents choosing not to evacuate, but
no other factors related to uptake or use of the interven-
tions were reported. Findings from this study, although
limited by recall bias and lack of exposure measure-
ments, suggest that PACs may protect respiratory health
during smoke events.
More recently, Fisk and Chan [14] modelled the po-
tential health benefits and economic costs associated
with filtration in homes during a 2003 wildfire smoke
event that affected six counties in southern California.
Health benefits were quantified as reductions in prema-
ture deaths and hospital admissions related to asthma,
bronchitis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and
pneumonia. Cost estimates were based on purchase and
operational costs associated with implementation of six
intervention scenarios in (i) all homes, and (ii) homes of
older adults (≥65 years) only, who were assumed to
spend more time indoors at home compared with the
general population. Three out of six intervention scenar-
ios involved the use of PACs (as a stand-alone interven-
tion or in conjunction with low and high efficiency
induct filtration), with the remaining scenarios based on
induct filtration only. Mean reductions in indoor PM2.5
concentrations of 45, 51 and 62% were estimated for
PAC only use, PAC use with low efficiency induct filtra-
tion, and PAC use with high efficiency induct infiltra-
tion, respectively. In comparison, mean reductions for
scenarios involving induct filtration ranged from 11 to
47%. The scenarios included continuous use of forced
air systems with low efficiency filters (24%), continuous
use of forced air systems with high efficiency filters
(47%), and intermittent use of forced air systems with
high efficiency filters (11%). The mean reduction in indoor
PM2.5 concentrations by PACs alone was equivalent to
that associated with continuous use of high efficiency in-
duct filtration. During the wildfire period, 133 (95% CI:
26, 262) premature deaths and 417 (95% CI: 265, 655) re-
spiratory hospital admissions were attributed to smoke
among a total estimated population of 20.5 million. Model
results estimated that use of PACs alone may have
Barn et al. Environmental Health  (2016) 15:116 
Page 3 of 8
 reduced smoke-related deaths and hospital admissions
by 30 and 45%, respectively [14]. Targeted PAC use
among older adults may have resulted in reductions of
50 and 78%, respectively [14]. Targeted implementation
of PAC use among older persons was economically
feasible, being associated with costs of $368 million
(based 1.53 million homes and $239/PAC), and health-
related benefits of $445 million (deaths and hospital ad-
missions avoided) [14].
The benefits of PAC use for respiratory health are
well-studied, with much of the literature suggesting their
use in homes can improve asthma- and allergy-related
symptoms [15]. Filtration efficiency of allergens may be
greater because allergens tend to be larger than PM2.5
(in the 5 to 30 μm range). More recently, several studies
have evaluated the effects of PAC use on cardiovascular
health (Table 2). These studies have mostly used ran-
domized designs to evaluate objective health outcomes.
To date, PAC use has been linked to improvements in
cardiovascular indicators such as endothelial function
[16, 17], systemic inflammation [11, 17], and blood pres-
sure [11, 18]. These studies report benefits over 2–7 days
of PAC use, the typical duration of smoke episodes. The
mean and median baseline PM2.5 concentrations were
low (≤ 8 μg/m3) in two studies that reported null associ-
ations [19, 20]. Another study reported higher blood
concentrations of IL-6, a marker of inflammation, with
PAC use [21]. The filtration (PAC use) and control (no
PAC use) periods were randomly assigned for each par-
ticipant. The authors noted that baseline differences in
IL-6 concentrations and use of anti-inflammatory medi-
cation between groups who received the intervention in
the first half versus the second half of the study could in
part explain these findings [21].
Implementing PAC use
Unfortunately, very little has been published on the con-
siderations and challenges of implementing widespread
PAC use during smoke events, and more evidence would
benefit the public health community. Regardless, several
considerations are likely required for successful imple-
mentation of the intervention, including: the intensity
and duration of the smoke event; timing and preparation
for implementation; costs, availability, and accessibility
of the units; public health messaging; and needs of the
community. Smoke from landscape fires is unpredict-
able, and timely management of exposures may require
a large number of units over a short time period.
Additionally, the costs of purchasing PACs may be pro-
hibitive unless subsidized or provided free-of-charge to
community members. Public health authorities may
want to consider targeted implementation of PAC use
among susceptible sub-populations in their primary re-
sponse, but may need to expand the response to the
general public for longer and/or more intense smoke
events. Susceptible groups include people with pre-
existing conditions, pregnant women, infants, children,
older adults, and people of lower socioeconomic status
[3, 14]. Guidance on effective PAC use should include
information on types of units, appropriate sizing, limit-
ing ventilation to reduce entry of outdoor air, and poten-
tial risks from heat and indoor-generated pollutants. The
Clean Air Delivery Rate (CADR) is a voluntary industry
rating system developed for portable HEPA filter devices
that can provide guidance on appropriate sizing. The
CADR ratings are listed on some units, and describe
their efficiencies at different room sizes based on three
pollutants: tobacco smoke, dust, and pollen [22]. The
CADR rating for tobacco smoke is most relevant to
wildfire smoke [22].
The use of both private and public clean air shelters
should be considered in the public health response to
landscape fire smoke. In addition to staying indoors in
homes, community members may also be advised to
spend time in designated public clean air shelters, such as
shopping malls and libraries, which ideally limit the entry
of outdoor air and allow for dilution of smoke. Taking ad-
vantage of existing induct filtration or air conditioning in
large buildings is a practical approach, particularly when
these systems use high efficiency filtration. However, some
buildings may only be equipped to operate low efficiency
filters that provide limited benefits with respect to expos-
ure reduction. In such situations, PACs can offer a flexible
solution to temporarily augment existing low efficiency in-
duct filtration systems, given that portable air cleaners are
adequately sized to clean these spaces. The ability of indi-
viduals to access public clean air shelters should also be
considered. Although these shelters can provide benefits
to larger populations, travel to these spaces may be diffi-
cult for some, particularly during smoky conditions, and
time spent there is typically intermittent. On the other
hand, filtration in residential buildings can offer bene-
fits that are more continuous because people may
spend more time in private clean air shelters than in
public clean air shelters, especially those at highest risk.
The continued evaluation of PAC use during wildfires
in private and public spaces could help to establish best
practice guidelines.
Conclusions
Landscape fires can expose communities to high con-
centrations of PM2.5 and other pollutants. Many well-
conducted studies show that PACs can lower indoor
PM2.5 exposures and benefit respiratory and cardiovas-
cular health. Public health officials should promote PAC
use as a fundamental part of their response to smoke
from landscape fires.
