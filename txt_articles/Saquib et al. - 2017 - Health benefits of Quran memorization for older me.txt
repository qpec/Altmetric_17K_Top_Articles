Introduction
Most data pertaining to the relationship between religious 
activity and health outcomes come primarily from studying 
people of the Christian faith.1 More often than not, reli-
gious practices were associated with self-reported better 
general health and a higher quality of life (mental and phys-
ical health).2,3 Religious practices were also found to be 
beneficial for non-cardiovascular outcomes, for example, 
shorter duration in vegetative state among head injury 
patients,4 higher pregnancy among infertile women,5 lower 
mortality among sepsis patients,6 and better immunity 
among older adults.7,8 However, the effect of religious 
practices on cardiovascular outcomes was mixed. The lit-
erature addressed outcomes such as hypertension, myocar-
dial infarction, and coronary heart disease, but irrespective 
of outcome, the findings included beneficial effects,9,10 no 
effect,11,12 and detrimental effects13 in a few cases.
A body of literature, albeit limited, exists about the health 
effects of religious practices among Muslims, and these 
include the listening, reciting, or repeating (zikr) the text of 
the Quran, the holy book for the Muslims.14–17Two experi-
mental studies showed that listening to Quran recitation (15 
and 18 min, respectively) increased the mental health score 
among nursing students and reduced anxiety in cardiac

Abstract
Objective: To examine the association between Quran memorization and health among older men.
Methods: This cross-sectional study included older Saudi men (age 
≥ 
55 
years) from Buraidah, Al-Qassim. The neighborhoods 
were selected randomly (20 out of 96); eligible men from the mosques were recruited. Demographics, lifestyle, and depression 
were assessed with standardized questionnaires; height, weight, blood pressure, and random blood glucose (glucometer) 
were measured with standard protocol.
Results: The mean and standard deviation for age, body mass index, and Quran memorization were 63 
years (7.5), 28.9 
kg/
m2 (4.8), and 4.3 sections (6.9). Prevalence of hypertension, diabetes, and depression were 71%, 29%, and 22%, respectively. 
Those who memorized at least 10 sections of Quran were 64%, 71%, and 81% less likely to have hypertension, diabetes, and 
depression compared to those who memorized less than 0.5 sections, after controlling for covariates.
Conclusion: There was a strong linear association between Quran memorization and hypertension, diabetes, and depression 
indicating that those who had memorized a larger portion of the Quran were less likely to have one of these chronic 
diseases. Future studies should explore the potential health benefits of Quran memorization and the underlying mechanisms.

patients.14,15 In a cross-sectional study, geriatric-home resi-
dents who reported Quran recitation had significantly better 
mental health than those who did not recite.16 The single 
experimental study that evaluated the health effects of zikr in 
patients awaiting surgery reported a subjective reduction of 
anxiety and pain but no difference in objective measures 
such as blood pressure or heart rate.17
An important religious practice for Muslims is the memo-
rization of Quran. The text of Quran—6,236 verses, arranged 
in 30 sections—forms the basis of daily prayer to and 
remembrance of God for Muslims. In addition, Muslims 
believe that Quran memorization, as an act of worship, will 
be rewarded in the hereafter. Therefore, they try to memorize 
as much of the text as possible—to the extent that many peo-
ple, even when their mother tongue is not Arabic, memorize 
the entire book.
There is hardly any data on the health effects of Quran 
memorization despite the importance of it in the Islamic 
faith. In a Kuwaiti study, Quran memorization was part of a 
15-item religious commitment scale, and the results showed 
a lower systolic and diastolic blood pressure among those 
with higher commitment.18 It was, however, not clear, as per 
the analysis adopted, whether the benefit reported was attrib-
utable to the memorization itself.
Saudi Arabia is an ideal place to study the health effects 
of Quran memorization since the Saudis speak Arabic, the 
original language of the Quran. Learning to read and memo-
rize the Quran is included in the public educational curricu-
lum at all levels; also, specialized schools are available to 
train students on memorization specifically. Furthermore, 
the prevalence of chronic diseases, such as diabetes and 
hypertension, among adults is notably high.19,20
In this cross-sectional study from Al-Qassim, Saudi 
Arabia, participants were asked about the extent of their 
Quran memorization. They were also assessed for hyperten-
sion, diabetes, and depression. The hypothesis was that par-
ticipants who had memorized a larger portion of the Quran 
would be less likely to have hypertension, diabetes, or 
depression compared to those participants who had memo-
rized a smaller portion.
Methods
Sample
This study used a cross-sectional design and enrolled 400 
men from the city of Buraidah, Al-Qassim, Saudi Arabia. 
The inclusion criteria were (a) aged at least 55 or older, (b) 
Saudi citizenship, and (c) resident of Buraidah. According to 
governmental statistics, the total male population of 
Al-Qassim region of Saudi Arabia in 2016 was 501,831, of 
which 9.5% or approximately 50,000 were aged 55 years and 
older.21 Previous data estimate the prevalence of diabetes 
and hypertension to be 35% and 33%, respectively, among 
adult males in Al-Qassim.21 The required sample size for this 
study was 381 men (95% confidence level and with a 5% 
margin of error).22 In order to ensure that we had adequate 
power during the statistical analysis, we increased our sam-
ple by 5%. This was to compensate for any missing data 
related to the collection of blood samples or refusal to give a 
blood sample. The research ethics committee in the College 
of Medicine at Sulaiman Al-Rajhi Colleges approved this 
study in 2015 and the data were collected between December 
2015 and February 2016.
Sampling strategy
A multi-stage semi-random sampling technique was used 
to obtain the sample. A detailed area map of Buraidah city 
was used to list the neighborhoods (total 96 neighbor-
hoods), and 20 were selected randomly from it. All 
mosques in the selected neighborhoods were mapped and 
listed. The recruitment goal was three eligible persons per 
mosque. Therefore, 133 mosques were needed to obtain 
the desired sample of 400. However, 20% extra mosques 
were selected (total 160) in order to ensure that the study 
had the desired sample.
Research assistants described the study objectives and 
procedures to the prayer attendees and invited the eligible 
participants to join. Those who showed interest were given 
the informed consent form, which they read and signed to be 
enrolled into the study.
Assessment
The assessment took place in a quiet corner of each mosque 
after prayer. Participants were interviewed with standardized 
questionnaires to obtain information on demography, life-
style, and depression. After the interview, they were assessed 
for physical measurements (i.e. height, weight, and blood 
pressure) and blood glucose while maintaining standard pro-
tocols. Two blood pressure readings were taken with a digital 
sphygmomanometer and the lowest value was recorded. 
Random blood glucose was measured with a glucometer 
(Accu-Chek Active).23
Exposure
Participants were asked how much of the Quran they had 
memorized. They were categorized as follows: less than 0.5, 
0.5–1, 2–4, 5–9, and 10–30 sections.
Outcome
Hypertension was defined as systolic blood pressure of ≥140 
or diastolic ≥90 mm Hg or use of anti-hypertensive medica-
tion. Diabetes was defined as blood glucose ≥200 mg/dL or 
use of anti-diabetic medication. Depression was defined as a 
summary score of 2 or greater in the Patient Health 
Questionnaire-2 (PHQ-2).24

Covariates
Covariates included age (<60, 60–69, and ≥70 years), body 
mass index (BMI; <25, 25–29.9, and ≥30), employment (yes 
and no), daily walking (yes and no), eating at restaurants 
(mostly at home and both home and restaurant), cigarette 
smoking (never, former, and current), and economic status 
(poor to lower middle class and upper middle class to rich). 
The covariates were selected based on the evidence shown in 
the scientific literature that the covariate was related to 
chronic diseases (e.g. diabetes and hypertension) and was 
considered to be a risk factor.25–27
Analysis
Data analysis was carried out with SPSS (version 22); all 
tests were two-sided with an alpha level of 0.05. Analysis 
began with the generation of descriptive statistics of varia-
bles. Mean and standard deviation for continuous and fre-
quency for categorical variables were reported. Covariates 
(i.e. age, BMI, employment status, restaurant eating, daily 
walking, exercise, and economic status) were compared 
across the categories of Quran memorization; linear contrast 
in the general linear model (analysis of variance (ANOVA)) 
and Cochran–Armitage trend test were used for the compari-
son of continuous and categorical variables, respectively.
Logistic regression was employed to model outcomes 
(i.e. hypertension, diabetes, and depression). First, the mod-
els were run with only Quran memorization variable (unad-
justed analysis); the odds ratios and the associated 95% 
confidence interval for each of the comparison categories 
were estimated. Afterwards, the models were run without 
specifying that Quran memorization was a categorical vari-
able in order to obtain p value for trend for each outcome. 
These two-step processes were replicated after including the 
covariates in the models (adjusted analysis). Hosmer–
Lemeshow test was used to check for model adequacy.
Results
The participants’ mean age was 63 years (standard devia-
tion = 7.5 years) and mean BMI was 28.9 kg/m2 (standard 
deviation = 4.8). Most of them were overweight or obese 
(78%). Almost all of them were married, and 35% were 
employed. A large majority of them (76%) reported to be 
non-smokers and were consuming mostly home-cooked 
food (65%). A little over half of them (54%) reported daily 
walking. Most of them reported that they belonged to the 
middle class, and a minority categorized themselves as 
poor (9%) or rich (6%; Table 1). Prevalence of hyperten-
sion, diabetes, and depression were 71%, 29%, and 22%, 
respectively. The participants reported memorization of an 
average of 4.3 sections of Quran (standard deviation = 6.9). 
The distribution of memorization by sections was 21.0% 
(less than 0.5 sections), 30.5% (0.5–1 sections), 22.5% 
(2–4 sections), 12.5% (5–9 sections), and 13.5% (10–30 
sections; Figure 1).
The mean age and BMI varied across the categories of 
Quran memorization; the variation, however, was non-direc-
tional (increase or decrease across the categories) and statisti-
cally non-significant. Similarly, no significant variation by 
employment and eating out at restaurants was observed 
although employment frequency was least among those who 
reported <0.5 section of memorization (Table 2). There was a 
monotonic decrease of smoking (current as well as

former) frequency across Quran memorization, with the high-
est frequency observed among those with <0.5 section and the 
lowest among those with between 10 and 30 sections of memo-
rization (p < 0.0001). The frequency of daily walking (p = 0.06) 
and higher economic status (self-reported upper middle class 
or rich, p = 0.01) increased across the memorization categories, 
except for highest (i.e. 10–30 sections; Table 2).
In the unadjusted models, Quran memorization was sig-
nificantly associated with all three outcomes; specifically, 
the likelihood of hypertension, diabetes, and depression 
decreased across the increased categories of memorization 
(p trend values < 0.0001). These dose–response relationships 
between memorization and outcomes attenuated to some 
extent but still were significant after the models were 
adjusted for the covariates (p trend: hypertension = 0.001, 
diabetes = 0.003, and depression < 0.0001). In the unadjusted 
models, the odds ratios for the top three memorization cate-
gories (2–4, 5–9, and ≥10 sections) were significant for dia-
betes and depression, and only the highest category (≥10) 
was significant for hypertension. After adjustment for covar-
iates, the statistical significance of some of these estimates 
was lost, except for the highest category. For example, the 
likelihood of hypertension, diabetes, or depression were, 
respectively, 64%, 71%, and 81% less likely for those who 
memorized at least 10 sections of Quran compared to those 
with <0.5 section memorization (Table 3).
Discussion
In this study, a linear trend was observed between the quan-
tity of Quran memorization and disease outcomes, that is, the 
likelihood of participants having hypertension, diabetes, and 
depression decreased across the increased categories of 
memorization. In particular, the benefit was strong and sig-
nificant for participants who memorized at least 10 sections 
of Quran. Importantly, these effects were independent as the 
models were adjusted for established risk factors of the 
selected disease outcomes such as age, BMI, smoking, exer-
cise habit, and self-perceived health.25–27
The results of this study on Quran memorization are not 
easily comparable to other studies that addressed religious 
practices and health. First, the definition of the religious 
practices varies among the studies.2–5 More importantly, reli-
gious practices may have different meanings across faiths. 
Finally, the comparison is constrained by the limited availa-
bility of data; for example, no studies have been published 
with diabetes as an outcome, and only one study was avail-
able on depression.28 In that study, among patients with dis-
parate diseases, those who reported moderate/high religious 
struggle exhibited higher levels of depression.28 There were 
multiple studies on hypertension or blood pressure as an out-
come.7,13,18,29 While there were several studies that reported 
that religious practices were associated with lower blood 
pressure,7,18 there were others that found that religious prac-
tices were related to increased blood pressure.13
There is little explanation available, in the absence of data, 
as to why Quran memorization would be protective of diseases. 
Quran memorization might be viewed as a testimony of faith 
by the Muslims, and the higher the memorization, the greater 
the psychological boost it produces to their belief, which 
includes a sense of happiness, contentment, and positive atti-
tude. Also, memorization of the Quran leads the believer to 
recite it in order to retain it, and the frequency of recitation is 
likely higher for those who memorize a large portion of it. This 
recitation may yield a similar type of health benefit that prayer 
or chanting does to the people of other faiths. Recitation of 
Quran also means a continuous reminder to Muslims of things 
that they should avoid. For example, they are to refrain from 
consuming substances that are injurious to their body and 
mind, which may explain a very low prevalence of smoking 
among those with a higher quantity of memorization.
We had limited sampling options, and we chose the one 
that had the potential to draw a representative sample. We 
were not aware of the existence of any local database (e.g. 
city council or local governorate) from which we could 
draw a random sample. However, the social norms make 
it less acceptable to conduct home visits by unknown per-
sons (e.g. research assistants), thereby eliminating the

possibility of obtaining the sample through random selec-
tion of houses. That left the option of a convenient sam-
ple, for example, selecting participants from market 
places or malls. We felt that a mosque-based sample was 
a good compromise between these two sampling tech-
niques. We employed randomness in the selection of 
neighborhoods and mosques. At the same time, it is cus-
tomary among the Saudis to go to mosque for daily 
prayers, and the rate of attendance is very high among 
older adult males. Therefore, mosques provided a suitable 
gathering place for all who could be theoretically eligible 
for this study. It should, however, be noted that we missed 
those who were ill at the time of the study or who could 
not attend prayer because of their physical disability.
The quantity of Quran memorization should be inter-
preted as a strong correlate of hypertension, diabetes, and 
depression, but no causality can be inferred for any of the 
outcomes as the cross-sectional design of this study did not 
allow the ascertainment of temporality between the timing 
of Quran memorization and the development of these out-
comes. That being said, in the large majority of cases, 
Muslims memorize Quran at an early age, either in child-
hood or in adolescence, and memorization in adulthood is a 
rarity. Therefore, it is likely that the memorization hap-
pened long before the development of these adult-onset 
diseases. Another related issue is the precision of informa-
tion about Quran memorization that the participants pro-
vided. We do not know of any study that assessed how 
accurately Muslims self-report information in this regard, 
but Muslims who memorize either a portion of or the whole 
Quran are likely to know how the sections are structured. 
Additionally, the participants were not aware of the study’s 
hypothesis, and therefore, did not have any incentive to 
misreport this information.
The study outcomes were assessed either with an objec-
tive measure (e.g. hypertension or diabetes) or with a vali-
dated questionnaire (e.g. depression). However, the disease 
estimates were likely affected by the study’s assessment 
protocol. We may have slightly underestimated the preva-
lence of diabetes and hypertension. We used random blood 
glucose and self-reported use of medicine as the definition 
for diabetes, but we did not include any secondary tests 
(e.g. fasting blood glucose or HbA1c) nor did we consider 
symptoms of hyperglycemia. The blood pressure data were 
taken from the lower of the two readings as opposed to the 
average, which may have lowered our estimates of hyper-
tension. As for depression, the PHQ is a screening and not 
a clinical tool for diagnosis.30 Moreover, we chose to apply 
the lower cut-off value (2 instead of 3, both are recom-
mended) for depression diagnosis, as there were only a few 
participants with depression at the higher value, and there-
fore, it was not suitable for analysis. The lower cut-off 
value increased the sensitivity and decreased the specific-
ity, diagnosing some participants as depressed when in 
reality they were not.
Conclusion
There was a strong linear association between Quran memo-
rization and hypertension, diabetes, and depression (after

adjusting models for established risk factors) indicating that 
those who had memorized a larger portion of the Quran 
were less likely to have one of these chronic diseases. This 
finding suggests that the potential health benefits of Quran 
memorization and the underlying mechanisms should be 
researched. Future studies should note the limitations of this 
study and improve on the design and the measurement, for 
example, using a more representative sample by including 
females and younger adults and obtaining data from a wider 
geographical area.
