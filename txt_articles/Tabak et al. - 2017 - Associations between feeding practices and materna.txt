Summary
Objective
This study aimed to explore factors associated with accuracy of maternal weight percep-
tion and determine if maternal feeding practices are associated with weight status.
Methods
Overweight/obese mothers reported demographics and perception of their childˈs weight
and completed a modified preschooler feeding questionnaire. Motherˈs and childˈs height
and weight were measured. Logistic regression was used to explore associations
between demographic factors and accuracy. Correlations between the preschooler feed-
ing questionnaire scales and momˈs body mass index (BMI) and childˈs BMI-percentile
were explored for the total sample and accurate and underestimating moms.
Results
Among mothers whose child was overweight or obese, only 20% of mothers correctly
identified the child as overweight. Forty percent of moms were underestimaters. There
was a positive correlation between concern the child was overweight/overeating and
the childˈs BMI-percentile among underestimating moms; in the total sample (r = 0.32,
p < .001) and accurate moms (r = 0.52, p < .001). In underestimaters only, there was a
negative relationship between child BMI-percentile and pressure to eat (r = �0.30,
p < .001) and concern about child underweight (r = �0.47, p < .001).
Conclusions
This study identified different associations between child weight and motherˈs feeding
practices in mothers accurately and inaccurately perceiving her childˈs weight. Interven-
tion studies should explore targeting education on feeding practices based on these
perceptions.
Keywords: Child feeding practices, maternal weight perception, obesity.
Introduction
From 2011 to 2012, 24% of US children aged 2–5 years
were overweight, and 11% were obese (1). The high
prevalence of overweight and obesity in young children
is associated with numerous health risks during child-
hood (2–6) and adulthood (7–9). Parental feeding prac-
tices can shape a childˈs dietary behaviours (10–13).
Parents, especially mothers, typically control the family
ˈs food environment. Child dietary behaviours, such as
fruit and vegetable intake, are associated with parent
feeding practices including dietary modelling, food rules
and
encouragement
(12,14–16).
Although
studies
suggest that mothers play an important role in shaping
childrenˈs eating patterns (10–12), many are unaware of
their childrenˈs weight status (17–25). This is particularly
true for young children (18,23,24).
While considerable research has investigated the prev-
alence of parental underestimation of weight status, fewer
studies
have
investigated
the
implications

 underestimation in terms of healthy eating behaviours
and obesity prevention (26,27). For example, a mother
may be less motivated to promote healthier behaviours
if she underestimates her childˈs weight status.(28)
Despite the importance of parental feeding practices in
shaping dietary behaviours, there is limited research into
how these practices might be related to weight status
among mothers who do and do not accurately perceive
their childˈs weight status, and none among a sample of
overweight and obese parents.(29–33)
To fill this gap, the purpose of this paper is to explore
factors associated with accuracy of maternal perception
of her childˈs weight, to determine whether maternal feed-
ing practices are associated with maternal and/or child
weight status, and to assess whether the association be-
tween maternal feeding practices and child weight status
differs depending on accuracy of maternal weight per-
ceptions of her child. We have outlined the hypothesized
conceptual model for this work in Figure 1, which de-
scribes the hypothesized relationship between maternal
factors and accuracy of maternal weight perception, and
hypothesized associations between feeding practices
and child weight status, which differs depending on the
accuracy of the motherˈs perception of her childˈs weight
status.
Methods
Participants
This study was a cross-sectional, baseline analysis of the
Healthy Eating and Active Living Taught at Home study,
which evaluated the translation of the Diabetes Preven-
tion Program into the Parents As Teachers child develop-
ment programme. The Healthy Eating and Active Living
Taught at Home study included 230 overweight and
obese mothers and their preschool child living in the St.
Louis region. To be eligible, mothers had a preschool-
aged child at risk for obesity (60th to 84th percentile for
body mass index (BMI)) (34) or already overweight or
obese (≥85th percentile for BMI), and the mother had to
be able to read in English. Mothers were recruited through
parent–child organizations, maternal child health care
settings and through media outlets. All mothers provided
informed consent, and baseline data was obtained on the
mother and her youngest eligible child at one observation.
During the consent process mothers were told that the
purpose of the study was to evaluate the standard Par-
ents as Teachers lessons plus additional information
about how families can live healthy and active lives while
reaching a healthy weight. This study was approved by
the Universityˈs Human Research Protection Office.
Participants received a $50 gift card for completing the
baseline survey.
Measures
The demographic survey measures described in the fol-
lowing analyses were identical to those from our prior
studies with Parents As Teachers and assessed age,
race/ethnicity,
current
education
level,
employment
status and number of children (35,36). Height and weight
of the mother and preschooler were measured by trained
staff in accordance with National Health And Nutrition Ex-
amination Survey procedures.(37). Mothers completed a
survey that assessed her and her childˈs demographic
characteristics, her perception of her childˈs weight
(I think my child is; Very Underweight; A little Under-
weight; About the right weight; A little Overweight; Very
Overweight), and included a modified version of the pre-
schooler feeding questionnaire (PFQ) (Table S1). (38,39).
The 32-item PFQ asked parents about feeding practices
and beliefs and concerns about childˈs weight using a
five-point scale. The tool assessed contextual factors,
such as how, when and why children are fed. These in-
cluded the following factors: (1) Difficulty in Child Feeding
(α = 0.85); (2) Concern about Child Overeating or Being
Overweight (α = 0.81); (3) Pushing the Child to Eat More
(α = 0.67); (4) Using Food to Calm the Child (α = 0.60);
(5) Concern about Child Being Underweight (α = 0.72);
(6) Childˈs Control of Feeding Interactions (α = 0.53);
(7) Structure During Feeding Interactions (α = 0.49); and
(8) Age-Inappropriate Feeding (α = 0.23) (Table S1).

 Analysis
Moms were categorized into three groups based on the
accuracy of their perception of their childˈs weight, com-
paring the motherˈs categorization of her childˈs weight
status with the measured weight status ([1] accurately
perceiving their child as normal weight if the child was
normal weight or accurately perceiving the child as over-
weight if the child was overweight; [2] perceiving the child
as underweight or normal weight if the child was over-
weight or obese (underestimaters); or [3] perceiving the
child as overweight if the child was normal weight). Be-
cause of the very small number of participants falling in
the third category, these mothers were not included in
the stratified analyses. Unadjusted bivariate logistic
regression was used to explore whether demographic
factors predicted accuracy of momˈs perception; these
models were then adjusted (childˈs gender, childˈs
race/ethnicity, number of children in the home, momˈs
education, momˈs employment status, number of hours
mom works and income), based on a priori hypotheses.
Scales from the PFQ were used in the current analysis
(38,39). The factors and their internal consistency are
described in the Supporting Information. Correlations
between the scores on each scale with momˈs BMI and
with her childˈs BMI percentile were explored for the total

 sample. Then, to explore moderation, the sample was strat-
ified based on accurately and inaccurately perceiving her
childˈs weight, and the correlations were explored in each
stratum. The presence of a significant association in one
stratum, but not the other was used to compare the pres-
ence of a difference in the association between the strata.
Results
Table 1 provides a summary of participant characteristics
for mothers and their participating child. On average
mothers were 32 years old (SD = 6), and children were
3.4 years old (SD = 0.8). Most mothers reported their race
and the race of their child as Caucasian/non-Hispanic
(51% and 48%, respectively) or African American/non-
Hispanic (31% and 32%, respectively). Approximately
half the children were male (54%). The income distribu-
tion of the sample was distributed relatively evenly from
<$20,000 to >$75,000. The mean BMI for mothers was
35 (SD = 5). For children, the mean BMI percentile was
81 (SD = 13); all children had a BMI in at least the 60th
percentile, and 23.5% of the sample is overweight (BMI
% ≥ 85) and 19.6% obese (BMI% ≥ 95). Eighty-one percent
of mothers thought their child was ‘about the right weight’,
while 11% thought their child was a little overweight and
7% thought their child was a little underweight. When
asked if they were worried their child was overweight,
75% of mothers disagreed, while only 9.6% agreed.
Accuracy of momˈs perception of her child weight
Only 57% of moms accurately identified their childˈs
weight status (Table 2). Among mothers with a child
who was at a healthy weight, 85% correctly identified
her child as normal weight, and among mothers with a
child who was overweight or obese, 20% correctly identi-
fied
her
child
as
overweight.
Only
3%
of
moms
overestimated their childˈs weight. Forty-one percent of
momˈs underestimated their childˈs weight. Of these, most
of the children were overweight (49%) or obese (34%);
however, moms rated their childˈs weight as about right.
The childˈs BMI percentile was significantly associated
with accuracy of prediction (Table 3), with greater likeli-
hood of accuracy as BMI percentile increased; this
strengthened after adjustment. No other demographic
factors were associated with accuracy of prediction.
Associations with the preschooler feeding
questionnaire
Table 4 presents the correlations between feeding prac-
tices and weight status. There was a positive correlation
between concern about the child being overweight or
overeating and the childˈs BMI percentile in the total
sample (r = 0.32, p < .001) and among mothers who accu-
rately identified the weight category for her child (r = 0.52,
p < .001). This indicates that mothers accurately perceiv-
ing their childˈs weight status were acting based on this
perception (e.g. stopping their child from eating too much
or getting upset when s/he ate too much). This associa-
tion was not significant among underestimating moms.
Among underestimating mothers, there was a negative
relationship between pressuring the child to eat more and
a higher childˈs BMI percentile (r = �0.30, p < .001). There
was also a negative relationship between the child BMI
percentile and concern about the child being underweight
(r = �0.47, p < .001) among underestimating mothers.
Neither of these associations were significant in the total

childˈs weight.
Discussion
In a sample where 43% of the children were overweight or
obese, only approximately 20% of mothers with an over-
weight or obese child considered their child to be over-
weight. The current study found that 41% of mothers
underestimated their childˈs weight status. This is much
lower (17) than some studies, which have found 79% of
mothers underestimating, but much higher (18,19) than
other studies, in which the rate of misreporting was
32–38%. The underestimating in the current study did
not appear to be associated with any demographic char-
acteristics aside from the childˈs actual BMI percentile
including race/ethnicity. Mothers have been shown to
underestimate the weight status of younger children and
those with lower BMIs more frequently in national (USA),
(18) school based, (22) and clinical (19) samples. Many
other studies have found demographic factors to be as-
sociated with accuracy of perception of child weight. This
is particularly true for factors reflecting maternal socio-
economic status such as education (40–43); however,
the current study did not find such associations. Doolen
et al. found associations between parental weight status
and underestimation of the childˈs weight status (21).
The current study included only mothers who were over-
weight or obese, which may, in part, explain the high rate
of underestimation. This is also concerning in the light of
recent research showing children of obese mothers were
less likely to recognize their own weight as well as that of
their mother and therefore may be related to shifting atti-
tudes towards weight status, where overweight is less
recognized because of its prevalence (44).
Associations among accurately perceiving mothers
Several feeding practices appeared to be associated with
child weight among mothers who accurately perceived
her childˈs weight. Among those mothers, our results
showed an increased concern that her child is overweight
or overeats as the childˈs BMI percentile increased. The
mothersˈ accurate perception of their childˈs weight
status may be influencing these mothers to be more con-
cerned about their childˈs weight and his/her eating be-
haviour. Although the current study did not assess the
association between maternal concern about her childˈs
weight status and feeding practices, such concern has

 been associated with restrictive feeding (45), which has
been associated with unhealthy eating behaviours and in-
creased weight status (46,47), particularly among obese
mothers (29,48).
Associations among in-accurately perceiving
mothers
There appeared to be associations between the childˈs
actual weight status and two of the motherˈs feeding prac-
tices even among the 41% of mothers that underestimated
their childˈs weight status. Mothers who underestimated
their childˈs weight status tended to report less pressure
to eat and less concern about the child being underweight
as the childˈs BMI percentile increased. In previous studies,
pressure to eat has also shown negative associations with
child BMI; these studies hypothesize that mothers pressure
children who are thinner to eat more than children who are
heavier (29,46–50). Similarly, these same mothersˈ con-
cern that their child is underweight also decreased as
the childˈs BMI increased, which is also consistent with
previous work (45–47). That we only found this associa-
tion in mothers underestimating their childˈs weight is in-
teresting and may indicate that, although these mothers
underestimated their childˈs weight status in relation to
their BMI, they accurately worry less about the child being
underweight and perceive less of a need to apply pres-
sure to eat. Both of these findings indicate that although
mothers may not consciously or accurately identify that
their child was overweight/obese, their feeding behav-
iours and perceptions were related to the childˈs weight
status, such that they are not pressuring their child to
eat and were less concerned about the child being under-
weight. Their behaviour seems to indicate they were still
recognizing something about their childˈs weight. This is
consistent with an investigation by Webber et al. that
found the association between child weight status and
pressure to eat was not modified by maternal perception
of the childˈs weight (29). The current study did not
explore the association between accuracy of maternal
perception of the childˈs weight status and feeding
practices, thus it is not possible to conclude whether
mothers who underestimate child weight status are less
concerned about the childˈs weight status or use less
pressure to eat.
Associations in the total sample
The current study found that few maternal feeding prac-
tices were related to child weight, and that these differed
depending on whether the mothers accurately perceived
their childˈs weight status. Much of the literature has found
associations with some feeding practices such as those
related to rewarding with food, pressure to eat, and control
over feeding interactions with child weight and/or dietary
behaviours, although the findings have largely been mixed
(41,43,46–48,50–53). The mixed results from the literature
as well as the lack of strong associations observed in the
current study may be related to the survey measure and
the difficulty in measuring parent-feeding practices. The
population in the current study is also different from many
previous studies, thus the survey may perform differently,
leading to disparate conclusions. Other studies have
found that the association between child weight and
feeding practices such as restriction are mediated by ma-
ternal
concern
about
the
child
being
overweight
(29,40,45). This may help explain the differential associa-
tions between child weight status and momˈs feeding
practices observed in the current study.
Important feeding behaviours
Although not all factors were associated with maternal per-
ception of child weight or with mom or child BMI, a number
of potentially problematic feeding behaviours were very
common in this diverse sample of overweight mothers.
Forty-three percent of mothers reported that the child at
least sometimes watches TV at meals. Further, nearly half
(47%) of mothers reported feeding her child herself if she
thought her child did not eat enough at least some of the
time. These are feeding practices, which have been
suggested to be related to development of obesigenic be-
haviours, and are frequent in the study population
(46,47,53–56). This is particularly important in this study
sample, as all children in the study had a BMI percentile
of at least 60%, a cutoff that may be important to begin
monitoring children for development of obesity (34).
Strengths/limitations
The current study is not able to determine the direction
of the relationships explored or whether the associa-
tions are causal, as it is cross-sectional. Additionally,
the analysis relied on maternal report of feeding prac-
tices using self-report questionnaires. While these mea-
sures have some evidence for reliability and validity,
issues with accuracy remain (39). Further, because this
is a population of overweight and obese mothers partici-
pating in an intervention study, the findings may not be
generalizable to all parents of young children. While this
study assessed maternal weight perceptions, it did not
assess perceptions from the child perspective as the chil-
dren were very young (mean 3.4 years old, SD = 0.8),
which may be important for future obesity development.
Also, the mothers were told about the purpose of the
study before completing the questions, which could have

 influenced their responses. This study is strengthened by
the diverse sample of overweight mothers, which enhances
the generalizability of the findings to a broader population
and the objective measurement of height and weight.
Conclusions
Nearly half of the mothers asked underestimated their
childˈs weight, considering them to be about the right
weight, when they were actually overweight or obese.
The
current
study
identified
different
associations
between a childˈs actual weight status and the motherˈs
reported feeding practices among mothers accurately
and inaccurately perceiving her childˈs weight. Future in-
tervention studies should explore screening participants
for accuracy of their childˈs weight status and incorporat-
ing this information into education on feeding practices.
