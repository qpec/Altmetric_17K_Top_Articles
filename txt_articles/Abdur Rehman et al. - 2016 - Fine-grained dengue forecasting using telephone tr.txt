Thousands of lives are lost every year in developing countries for failing to detect epidemics early because of the
lack of real-time disease surveillance data. We present results from a large-scale deployment of a telephone triage
service as a basis for dengue forecasting in Pakistan. Our system uses statistical analysis of dengue-related phone
calls to accurately forecast suspected dengue cases 2 to 3 weeks ahead of time at a subcity level (correlation of up
to 0.93). Our system has been operational at scale in Pakistan for the past 3 years and has received more than
300,000 phone calls. The predictions from our system are widely disseminated to public health officials and form
a critical part of active government strategies for dengue containment. Our work is the first to demonstrate, with
significant empirical evidence, that an accurate, location-specific disease forecasting system can be built using
analysis of call volume data from a public health hotline.
INTRODUCTION
The province of Punjab in Pakistan, with a population of close to
100 million (1), was affected by a dengue epidemic in 2011. More than
21,000 dengue patients were reported, most of them from the city of
Lahore (2). There was no mechanism to detect the epidemic early or
localize the outbreaks, resulting in the loss of more than 350 lives.
Becausethereisnoknowncureorvaccinefortreatingdifferentstagesof
dengue fever (3, 4), most public health efforts focus on prevention
through a combination of active disease surveillance and vector control
methods (5, 6). These methods target source reduction to eliminate the
breeding grounds of the vector through environmental waste manage-
ment, water management, and biological and chemical measures. The
World Health Organization advocates the use of early warning systems
to signal outbreaks ahead of time to contain diseases such as dengue.
To develop an early warning system, real-time surveillance data are
required. In developing countries, such as Pakistan, conventional health
data gathering methods are error-prone and take weeks to compile. This
leads to a delay in containment response against a disease, resulting in a
pandemic or seasonal outbreak. In particular, accurate forecasting of the
number of future patients and their location gives government agencies
adequate time to mobilize and target resources for containment and spread
awareness (7, 8). These early containment efforts curb the spread of dis-
ease at an early stage, restricting it from turning into a citywide outbreak
and affecting a large population.
Epidemiological data and geographical information system data
have previously been used for fine-grained disease surveillance (9);
however, the data-intensive nature of these systems requires the avail-
ability of a large workforce for data collection, often not available in the
developing world. Besides the cost of these systems, collection of disease
data requires significant training and regulatory interventions to ensure
that all health facilities, in both public and private sectors, report accu-
rate disease data in real time.
Therefore, in resource-constrained developing countries, it may
only be possible to estimate the spread of disease using indirect methods.
Previous works have explored the use of telephone triage services (10),
Internet search queries (11–13), online media reports (14), and envi-
ronmental parameters (15) as indirect data sources to build epidemic
warning systems. However, systems based on environmental parameters
andonlinemediareportsprovideonlycoarse-grainedsurveillancebecause
of the nature of the data sources, whereas Internet search query–based
systems only perform well in countries with high Internet penetration.
Data from telephone triage services (10) and health hotline facilities (16)
have been shown to have a correlation with influenza activity; NHS Direct
(17) uses calls to a health hotline to generate alerts to complement other
surveillance methods. However, previous studies have reported that
telephone triage services are not a reliable source of surveillance data on
a national scale because of variability in coverage and a lack of statistical
prediction models from these data (10).
Here, we present results of how we used a simple phone-based
helpline facility (telephone triage service) to develop an early epidemic
warning system for dengue in Pakistan. Contrary to previous experience,
our system provides an accurate measure of future disease cases at a fine-
grained subcity level. Our system not only flags an outbreak (17) but
also makes an accurate forecast (median correlation of 0.85) of both
the number of patients and their locations 2 to 3 weeks ahead of time.
The ability of our system to accurately forecast patients and their loca-
tions is critical for the government to mobilize and target its resources
to contain an outbreak. Our prediction model carefully incorporates
both weather indicators and awareness level in a community to reduce
the false alerts common in previous crowd-sourced systems (18).
We report on our experiences running the system since the start
of 2012 in Lahore, Pakistan (see Materials and Methods). With more
than 300,000 hotline calls, we provide block-level forecasts of dengue
cases to health organizations throughout the city and constantly validate
our inferences from case data gathered from hospitals in the city. The
appeal of our model is its usefulness despite its sheer simplicity; to our
best knowledge, our system is the first to demonstrate, with significant
empirical evidence, that an accurate, fine-grained, and locality-specific
disease forecasting system can be built using analysis of call volume data
from a public health hotline (or a telephone triage service) (19, 20).

 RESULTS
Figure1showsthebaseline datausedin ouranalysis.Figure 1Ahighlights
the high correlation between the number of dengue patients reported in
hospitals and the raw number of “dengue symptom inquiry” calls received
at the health hotline in Lahore for the years 2012–2013. In the data shown
in Fig. 1A, the numberof calls “lead”the numberof patients. Although the
numberofcallsaggregatedatthecitylevelhasastrongcorrelationwiththe
number of cases during the year 2012 as shown in fig. S1, we observe that
their relative variations across time and across different towns were not
uniform. Hence, calls cannot be used alone to predict the number of cases
and additional parameters, such as awareness level and climate conditions
needed to be incorporated in the model. Figure S1 shows the cross-
correlation values between suspected cases reported from hospitals and
the number of calls received at the health hotline for the city of Lahore
during 2012. Figure 1 (B and C) shows that 7 of 10 towns in Lahore
follow a similar pattern: the relative amount of calls received from a
town exhibits similar variations to the relative number of patients re-
ported from the same town.
Althoughourbaselineanalysisshowsacorrelationbetweencallvolume
data and disease cases, the calling patterns of citizens are naturally
dependent on the level of awareness about the telephone triage service.
ThisisvisibleinFig.1A.Duringthefirstpeakofcasesin2013,theawareness
campaign activities are low, resulting in a lower number of calls being
receivedatthehealthhotline.Incontrast,duringthesecondpeakofcases
in 2013, the awareness campaign activities are high, resulting in a higher
number of hotline calls. Previous studies that used data from alternative
data sources did not incorporate this aspect; however, for public hotline
services, it must be explicitly incorporated to address the inaccuracies in-
troduced by variable levels of awareness across towns. Furthermore, pre-
viousstudies that reported weakresults (10) from the use of triage service
for epidemic detection only relied on callvolume dataandignored other
factors, such as weather conditions. Because temperature, precipitation,
and humidity are critical to mosquito survival, reproduction, and develop-
mentandcaninfluencemosquitopresenceandabundance,ourmodelalso
incorporates city-level weather data (21).
Our dengue forecasting system is based on an ensemble model and
uses the random forest learning algorithm. We predict log(S(w + 2,l))
using C(w,l), A(w,l), H(w), T(w), R(w), where S(w + 2,l) is the suspected
cases reported during the second week after week w from town l; C(w,l)
and A(w,l) are the number of calls received by health hotline and the
number of awareness campaigns carried out in week w in town l, respec-
tively; and H(w), T(w), and R(w) are the average humidity, average tem-
perature, and average rainfall during week w in the city (see Materials and
Methods). The estimated model showed that the number of calls was the
most important feature to forecast log-suspected cases, followed by
average temperature (see Table 1). The estimates generated obtained
a good fit with log-suspected cases reported from the government hos-
pitals, with a median root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.80 (minimum,
0.52; maximum, 1.1; n = 10 towns) and a median correlation of 0.85
(minimum, 0.80; maximum, 0.93; n = 10 towns). Figure 2 shows the

 model forecasts for 2012 and 2013 across all the towns in Lahore. In Pa-
kistan, towns are the second smallest administrative units. Towns in La-
hore have a median area of 57 km2 (minimum, 24; maximum, 516; n =
10 towns).
To highlight the value added to the current model by the addition of
data about the number of patients, the log(S(w,l)) term was introduced
in the predictors. A similar methodology was used to estimate the dengue
cases 2 weeks in the future (see Materials and Methods). The estimates gen-
erated from the new model obtained a median RMSE of 0.63 (minimum,
0.50; maximum, 0.82; n = 10 towns) and a median correlation of 0.88
(minimum, 0.80; maximum, 0.94; n = 10 towns), with log-suspected cases
reported from the government hospitals as shown in Fig. 3.
Estimatesfordenguecases3weeksinthefuture,denotedlog(S(w+3,l)),
were also generated using a similar methodology. Estimates from the
modelwithoutdataaboutthenumberofpatientsasapredictorobtained a
median RMSE of 0.80 (minimum, 0.54; maximum, 1.1; n = 10 towns) and
amediancorrelationof0.84(minimum,0.77;maximum,0.91;n=10towns),
whereas estimates from the model incorporating data about the number of
patients as a predictor obtained a median RMSE of 0.67 (minimum, 0.53;
maximum, 0.87; n= 10 towns) and a median correlation of 0.86 (minimum,
0.77; maximum, 0.93; n = 10 towns). Figures S2 and S3 show forecasts from
both models across all 10 towns.
Table 1showsimportance valuesfor eachof the predictorsusedin the
2-week forecast ensemble model. Because fivefold cross-validation was
performed, each value is an average of the five values respective to each
of the five models. Calculating variable importance in an ensemble
model is difficult because the importance of a variable may be due to
its interaction with other variables. In the random forest algorithm, In-
cNodePurity for a variable is the total decrease in node impurities from
splitting on the variable, averaged over all trees. This is done by mea-
suring the residual sum of squares. The first column in Table 1 contains
theimportance valuesof predictorswhenthecompletedata set was used
in designing the ensemble model. The second column in Table
1 contains the importance values of predictors when the data of July
to November (the monsoon season) were used. Both models suggest
that call volume is the most important predictor of the suspected dengue
cases.Therelativeimportanceofcallvolumetoweatherparametersishigher
duringthe dengueactivity season. The relativeimportanceof awarenesscam-
paignactivitiesincreasesindengue activity season, suggesting that boththe
number of awareness campaigns starts to increase during the dengue sea-
son when cases start to appear. The effect of awarenesscampaigns on other
variables, specifically calling patterns of people, also becomes more signifi-
cant during the dengue season.
We compare the predictive power of the random forest model with a
generalized linear model at both a city- and a subcity-level granularity. For
both these models, we used the same training methodology as the random
forest (see Materials and Methods) and considered call volume data at the
corresponding granularity (city or subcity level). We note that reliable
weather parameters are only available at the city level. At the city-level
granularity, table S1 compares the individual predictive power of weather
parameters and call volume data in estimating the number of suspected
dengue cases 2 weeks in the future (on a log scale). The RMSE results sug-
gest that the random forest model significantly outperformed the generalized
linear model in predicting future dengue cases. Moreover, the best estimations
for the future dengue cases were made by the models that incorporated all
the variables as opposed to those that used only a subset of the variables. In
addition,themodelstrainedusingthecombinationofcallsandawareness
level data provide a better estimation of future dengue cases than those
trained using weather parameter data.
At a subcity granularity (town), we fit log-suspected cases of 2 weeks
in the future using a generalized linear model. The estimates generated
from this model obtained a median RMSE of 1.11 (minimum, 0.96; maxi-
mum, 1.53; n = 10 towns) and a median correlation of 0.55 (minimum,
0.30; maximum, 0.71; n = 10 towns), with log-suspected cases reported
from the government hospitals as shown in fig. S4. In comparison, the
random forest model yields significantly lower RMSE values and signif-
icantly higher correlation than the linear models.
Finally, we compare the predictive power of a subcity-level model
based entirely on weather parameter data with our original model. Log-
suspected cases of 2 weeks in the future for each town were fit separately
using a random forest model. The estimates generated from the model
obtained a median RMSE of 1.14 (minimum, 0.84; maximum, 1.35; n =
10towns)andamediancorrelationof0.51(minimum,0.26;maximum,0.65;

Deployment of a live system
Our phone-based dengue surveillance system described in this paper has
beensuccessfullydeployedincollaborationwiththegovernmentofPunjab
in Pakistan, andthe results arewidely disseminatedthroughthe disease ac-
tivity dashboard used by public health officials. A web service API call
retrievesdatafromthebackenddatabaseandperformsstatisticalanalyses
offlinethroughbatchmodeonaweeklybasistomakepredictionsof2weeks
in the future. To incorporate the changes in behavior of citizens calling
in, each week with the addition of newer data, the model is retrained to
incorporate the changes in behavior of users. The predictions are then
generated on the basis of the newly trained model.
Figure 4 shows the different snapshots of the health hotline interface
used by the operators and public health officials. The activity dashboard
helps them visualize quickly and evaluate the towns that are most vulner-
able to an increase in suspected cases and thereby effectively allocate field
workers who perform targeted containment activity. Field workers in Punjab
are equipped with smartphones by the government. A smartphone applica-
tion developed by the government of Punjab allows field workers to geo-tag
the location and type of containment activity they have performed. This
helps government officials ensure that the allocated task has indeed been
fulfilled by the field worker. It also helps the officials visualize the locations
of the activities and allocate additional workforce if required. Moreover,
during the weekly dengue meetings, headed by the chairman of the Punjab
government, the health officials of the most vulnerable towns are required

towns. The predictions from our system are widely disseminated to public
health officials and form a critical part of active government strategies for
dengue containment. Since the introduction of these containment strategies,
we have witnessed a reduction in the number of confirmed dengue pa-
tients in Lahore from 21,000 in 2011 to just 257 in 2012 and 1600 in 2013.
DISCUSSION
Onthebasisoftheresults,weconcludethatcallvolumedatafromasimple
hotline facility combined withwidely available city-levelweatherdata can
serve asagoodpredictoroffuturesuspecteddengue casesat afine-grained
subcitylevel.Surprisingly,addingdataaboutthenumberofpatientsintothe
existing model has a marginal effect in improving the prediction accuracy.
The addition of data about the number of patients only provides im-
provement in capturing the true peak of dengue activity during the high
dengue activity season. The appeal of our model is its usefulness despite its
sheer simplicity; a simple phone-based health hotline can be used to forecast
thenumberofpatientsatasubcitylocationgranularity2to3weeksahead
of time.
Settingupahealthhotlinetosupportdiseasesurveillancemechanisms
hasseveraladvantages.The healthhotline facility currently operationalis
cost-effective, making it ideal for resource-constrained environments in
developingcountries,suchasPakistan.Telephonetriage–basedsurveillance
systems also allow governments to identify disease activity at subcity
granularities, leading to effective utilization of their limited health field
workers for targeted containment. The forecasts generated from such a
system can become a substitute to the paper-based patient report data in
outbreak detection systems, which may take weeks to compile. The
healthhotlinecanbeeasilyextendedtomonitormultiplediseaseswithout
any substantial increase in allocation of resources; the current health hot-
linedeployedinPakistanisalsobeingusedtomonitorpoliodiseasecases.
Finally, health hotlines can provide an easy and centralized interface to
gather patient reports from hospitals.
Despitetheextensiveutilityofthecallstoahealthhotline,systemsbased
on call volume have to address several challenges carefully. First, the calls
to the health hotline included in our analysis are not exclusively made by
dengue patients; patients suffering from diseases with similar symptoms,
suchasmalaria,cancontributetoanincreaseincallvolume.Therefore,itis
important to devise criteria carefully for identifying calls pertaining to a
targetdisease.Moreover,theuseofahealthhotlinelargelydependsonthe
amount of awareness present in a community about the health hotline.
Hence,regularawarenesscampaignsareessentialtopromotethecontinuous
use of the health hotline. These awareness campaigns are often in the form
of radio and television (TV) commercials, banner postings, and awareness
group meetings. At the same time, as in our model, the level of awareness
needstobeincorporatedseparatelyinthediseaseforecastingmodels.Given
the fact that patients who suffer from a particular strain of dengue virus be-
comeimmunetoit,weassumethatmostofthecallerstothehealthhotline
are first-time callers. The same cannot be said about diseases that are reoc-
curringinthesameindividuals.Hence,furtherstudiesneedto be carriedout
to find the exact relation between the increase in awareness level in an indi-
vidualoracommunityandthedecreaseinthenumberofcallstothehealth
hotline. Nevertheless, we suggest continuous retraining of the model with
the latest data sets to account for changes in unknown variables over time.
Last, calling patterns within a city for individual localities may vary because
of the difference in socioeconomic conditions of the inhabitants. Given that
the socioeconomic data of inhabitants are generally not available in devel-
oping countries,werecommendtraining separatemodelsforeachlocality.
Insummary,ourworkdemonstrateshowaresource-constraineddevel-
oping country, such as Pakistan, can effectively use a health hotline–based
system to provide accurate dengue case forecasts, at fine-grained gran-
ularities, 2 to 3 weeks ahead of time. On the basis of our deployment ex-
periencesovera3-yeartimeperiod,wehaveobservedthedirectimpact of
the hotline system. Our system has helped public health officials to take
early actions to contain the spread of the disease and provide hospitals
an early warning of dengue cases in their vicinity. We believe that this
system can also be used for a broad array of diseases beyond dengue and
can easily be replicated in other developing countries at low costs.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Health hotline
In response to the 2011 outbreak in Lahore, the provincial government in
Punjab, Pakistan launched a multipronged effort to combat the epidemic
and improve its surveillance and rapid response system. A phone-based
disease helpline system was introduced, and a toll-free number was widely
publicized through TV and radio advertisements. There are up to 100 op-
erators during an outbreak period dedicated to serving up to 5000 calls a
day. Since the inception of the system in September 2011, more than
300,000callshavebeenfieldedby thesystem. Callersusethe healthhotline
to inquire if the symptoms they are having are the symptoms for dengue
disease.If thisisthecase,the firstresponderguidesthemtothenearesthos-
pitals and provides a brief description of the tests to be conducted and bed
availability in the hospitals. In addition, callers can request insecticide spray
at homes or in neighborhoods. The helpline has also been used to report
sewage leaks, stagnant water accumulation, and overcharging for hospi-
tal treatment. The first responders assign a category to each call. These re-
quests are used by public health workers to prioritize sanitation and
garbage collection drives. The health hotline is accessible throughout the
yeartoserve asan informationportalandtocollectreal-timecitizen feed-
back. The operators of the health hotline are trained by medical personnel
with detailed instructions to handle calls and manuals to identify symp-
toms of dengue. During the dengue season, doctors are also available at
the health hotline, and the operators are instructed to forward the calls
to the doctors in case of any ambiguity.
Awareness campaigns
As part of the initiative, the health workers in the government of Punjab
were tasked to visit neighborhoods and spread awareness about dengue
fever. Awareness seminars are carried out in mosques, schools, and other
community settings to inform the general public about the symptoms,
spread, and prevention of dengue. The health hotline number is widely
disseminated during these seminars as a means to discuss symptoms or
to inquire about bed availability in hospitals, if someone is suspected of
having dengue. Although these seminars are carried out throughout the
year, their frequency increases during the high dengue activity season.
Records for each awareness seminar are kept by the government for future
allocation of workers to spread awareness in a given town.
Hospitals and definition of cases
During the dengue outbreak, the government institutionalized a regime
where any patient suspected of dengue is sent to a public sector hospital
for further tests and treatment. These public sector hospitals from Lahore

 admitted dengue patients in specialized dengue wards and are accessible
to the general public. The government placed three computer operators in
each hospital to enter the data of dengue patients in a centralized patient
tracking system. Criteria were devised by the Dengue Expert Advisory
Group (DEAG) in Pakistan to identify suspected dengue patients so they
couldbe referred for laboratory tests. According to the criteria, if apatient
shows three or more of the following symptoms, the patient will be
marked as a “suspected dengue case.” These symptoms include fever of
2 to 10 days, retro-orbital pain, myalgia, arthralgia/severe backache, rash,
bleedingmanifestations(epistaxis,hematemesis,bloodystools,menorrhagia,
and hemoptysis), abdominal pain, decreased urinary output despite ade-
quate fluid intake, and irritability in infants.
Methods
For our analysis, we used data from the Punjab government’s toll-free
health hotline service. A single call unit, included in our analysis, is defined
as the call received at the health hotline, categorized by the operator as a
dengue symptoms inquiry call. The location of the caller is based on the in-
formation either provided by the caller or inferred by the first responder
using the address given by the caller. The operators are also allowedto mark
a call as irrelevant; these calls were excluded from our analysis. Dengue
awareness campaigns data were recorded from the health hotline. A
single awareness activity unit is defined as a dengue awareness seminar
carried out by a health worker from the government and reported at the
health hotline. Weather data used in our analysis were retrieved from the
Punjabmeteorologicaldepartment.Unlikethecallsandawarenessleveldata,
which are available at subcity location granularity, only coarse-grained city-
levelweatherparameterdatawereavailable.Finally,thenumberofsuspected
dengue case data was retrieved from all public sector hospitals in Lahore
between 2012 and 2013. A suspected dengue patient is defined as a pa-
tient who shows symptoms of dengue and is referred for a standardized
laboratory test by the doctor. The location of the patient is determined on
the basis of the residence address provided by the patient at the hospital.
Our dengue forecasting system is based on an ensemble model. We
use call volume data divided across 10 towns in the city of Lahore. Widely
available city-level weather parameters, specifically humidity, rainfall,
and temperature, are used in the model to incorporate the seasonality
of diseases such as dengue (21). Finally, because health hotline awareness
among citizens can affect calling patterns, our system treats awareness as
a separate parameter using the number of recorded hotline publicity ac-
tivities in a given time period as proxy. It is important to highlight that
previoussystems,suchasGoogleFluTrendsandNHSDirect,that purely
use query volume data for prediction, may generate inaccurate estimates
ofanoutbreakbecausetheyfailtoincorporatecriticalawareness level data
in their model (18). Awareness level can be defined as the likelihood that
a person will use an alternative source, such as a search engine or a health
hotline, to inquire about symptoms of a disease at a given time of a year.
Specifictosearchqueries,thiscanvaryforseveralreasons;ifanewdisease-
related drug isintroduced in the market or if a celebrity gets infected with
a disease, people are more likely to search online about the disease, con-
tributing to an increase in searches. This leads to an overestimation of
disease activity, which is a common problem in previous systems (18).
Hence, awareness level data need to be incorporated in the model to cater
for varying population interest in the alternative data source. Moreover, it
is also important to note that although an increase in search queries and
internet awareness can be a result of a wide range of factors, increasing
awarenessofahealthhotlineislargelydependentonthepublicityitreceives
during the awareness campaigns. Because these awareness campaigns and
their locations can be easily monitored, they can be easily accounted for in
our model. Finally, the suspected dengue case data were taken from the
hospitals in Punjab to serve as the response variable in our model.
Our ensemble model uses the random forest learning algorithm. The
choice to use a random forest–based learning algorithm was largely
guided by the advantages over linear regression/classification methods.
Given the nonlinearity observed in the data, the random forest algorithm
significantly mitigates the possibility of overfitting by using an ensemble
collectionofdecisiontreesandrandomizingoverfeaturesusedintraining
each individual decision tree (see Fig. 1 and fig. S4). Random forests also
allowforeasyinterpretabilityofthevariableimportanceoffeatures.Although
other more sophisticated models, such as gradient-boosted decision trees,
were viable alternatives, the performance gains we achieved using ran-
dom forests combined with the convenience of training and deployment
into our online outbreak detection system led us to favor random forests.
Between 1 January 2012 and 31 December 2013, data from the city of
Lahore were recorded from the mentioned sources. Weekly counts for
each town were computed separately. Weekly aggregates of 2 years for
10 towns generated a total of 1030 points. To validate our hypothesis, we
performed, fivefold cross-validation. The data points were split into five
randomly selected nonoverlapping folds, each containing 206 points. A
region-independent random forest model of regression trees comprising
500 trees and three-node sampling was trained using four folds and va-
