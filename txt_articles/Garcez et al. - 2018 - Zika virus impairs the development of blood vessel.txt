Zika virus (ZIKV) is associated with brain development abnormalities such as primary microcephaly, a 
severe reduction in brain growth. Here we demonstrated in vivo the impact of congenital ZIKV infection 
in blood vessel development, a crucial step in organogenesis. ZIKV was injected intravenously in the 
pregnant type 2 interferon (IFN)-deficient mouse at embryonic day (E) 12.5. The embryos were collected 
at E15.5 and postnatal day (P)2. Immunohistochemistry for cortical progenitors and neuronal markers 
at E15.5 showed the reduction of both populations as a result of ZIKV infection. Using confocal 
3D imaging, we found that ZIKV infected brain sections displayed a reduction in the vasculature 
density and vessel branching compared to mocks at E15.5; altogether, cortical vessels presented a 
comparatively immature pattern in the infected tissue. These impaired vascular patterns were also 
apparent in the placenta and retina. Moreover, proteomic analysis has shown that angiogenesis 
proteins are deregulated in the infected brains compared to controls. At P2, the cortical size and 
brain weight were reduced in comparison to mock-infected animals. In sum, our results indicate that 
ZIKV impairs angiogenesis in addition to neurogenesis during development. The vasculature defects 
represent a limitation for general brain growth but also could regulate neurogenesis directly.
Primary microcephaly is a severe brain malformation characterized by the reduction of the cephalic perimeter 
at birth. Microcephaly etiologies vary from genetic abnormalities to external factors such as the TORCHS path-
ogens (Toxoplasma gondii, others, Rubella, Cytomegalovirus, Herpes simplex virus and Syphilis). Recently, Zika 
virus (ZIKV) has been associated with primary microcephaly1, and it is considered a new TORCHS factor2. ZIKV 
infects human neural progenitors and impairs the growth of 3D differentiating cultures, such as neurospheres 
and brain organoids3–5. Moreover, in vitro, ZIKV alters the cell cycle and induces apoptosis in neural progenitor 
cells4,6. Studies using mouse models showed brain growth impairment as a result of ZIKV congenital infection7–9. 
However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms that underlie the brain growth failure in ZIKV congenital syn-
drome remain to be fully understood.
We hypothesize that disruption of neurovascular development is one of the primary determinants of ZIKV 
congenital syndrome. The cortical vascular plexus development starts as early as E11 in the mouse and is essential 
for the delivery of nutrients and for regulating the expression of signaling molecules, impacting on neurogene-
sis10,11. The cortical blood supply develops from the ventricular and the pial plexi12,13. In the embryonic mouse

brain, the formation of the vascular plexus is also partially driven by morphogenic factors such as Dlx1/2 and 
Pax614 and ensure adequate coverage of the neurogenic zones. Disruption of the vascular network has previously 
been shown to alter neurogenesis and cortical patterning12.
Here, we describe the use of a congenital mouse model of ZIKV-induced microcephaly, to investigate the 
effects of ZIKV infection on neuro-vascular development. Infecting type 2 interferon (IFN)-deficient (Ifng−
/−) 
pregnant mice with ZIKV at E12.5 resulted in reduced brain size at birth. At E15.5, neurogenesis was affected by 
ZIKV infection, radial glia and Ctip2 neuronal population are reduced compared to control animals. Moreover, 
blood vessels were found to be immature, with fewer branches and reduced area at E15.5; key angiogenesis pro-
teins were also found to be deregulated in the infected cerebral cortex at this time. The results reported here 
suggest a mechanism through which ZIKV infection of endothelial cells may contribute to the Zika congenital 
syndrome-like abnormalities demonstrated in this mouse model.
Results
ZIKV Infection Reduces Brain Size and Cortical Thickness in P2 Mouse Pups. 
ZIKV was injected 
intraveneouly (retro-orbital) in Ifng−
/− pregnant females at E12.5. At P2, the primary microcephaly-like syndrome 
was characterized by the smaller brain size, lower brain weight, and smaller skull size. Brain width and length was 
decreased in ZIKV infected brains compared to MOCK brains (Fig. 1A–D). There was a significant decrease in 
the weight of ZIKV infected brains (71.1 µg ± 3.7 µg, n = 9) compared to MOCK brains (100.5 µg ± 9.3 µg, n = 3) 
at P2 (p = 0.005; Fig. 1E). Similarly, skull size was reduced in ZIKV infected pups, although this effect showed 
considerable variability (Fig. 1F–H). Brain cortical thickness and cortical area were measured from DAPI stained 
sections at P2. The cortical thickness of ZIKV infected brains (501 µm ± 1.5 µm, n = 13, Fig. 1J) was significantly 
reduced compared to MOCK brains (583.3 µm ± 3.2 µm, n = 16, Fig. 1I). Statistical analysis showed that at P2,

there was a decrease in parietal cortical wall area (Fig. 1K), cortical progenitor layers (Fig. 1L) and areas of cortical 
layers II and III (Fig. 1M), as well as V and VI (Fig. 1N) in ZIKV infected pups compared to MOCK pups of same 
age. To determine the ZIKV RNA presence in maternal and newborn tissue, we used qPCR and detected ZIKV 
in the brain, eye, spleen, and placenta of infected mothers and in the brain of newborns 9 days post-infection 
(Fig. 1O, open symbols), in contrast to MOCK undetermined detection (Fig. 1O, closed symbols, dotted line).
ZIKV Infection at E12.5 Induces Defective Neurogenesis at E15.5. 
To evaluate the impact of ZIKV 
congenital infection at E12.5 in neurogenesis, we harvested the brains three days after the infection. At E15.5, 
dividing cells in the VZ and SVZ were identified with the M-phase marker, phospho-histone H3 (pH3, Fig. 2). 
At E15.5, a significant reduction in pH3+ cell population was detected in the VZ in the cerebral cortex of ZIKV 
infected compared to MOCK animals (Fig. 2A–C). In the SVZ, the number of pH3+ cells in ZIKV infected brains 
was also reduced (Fig. 2A,B,D). There was an associated decrease in the Pax6 progenitor population in the VZ 
(43.5 ± 8.1 cells in infected brains compared to 107 ± 18.0 cells in MOCK brains, p = 0.016; Fig. 2E–G) as well 
as a reduction in the early-born CTIP2 positive neurons in the cortical plate (98.3 ± 4.4 cells in MOCK brains 
compared to 60.2 ± 4.6 cells in infected brains, p = 0.002; Fig. 2E,F,H). These results confirm that neurogenesis is 
impaired in the congenital ZIKV infection.
ZIKV Infects Endothelial Cells and Reduces Cortical VZ Vascularization at E15.5. 
To examine 
the effect of ZIKV in blood vessel development in the cerebral cortex, we infected E12.5 pregnant females and 
harvested embryos three days after infection. We used IB4 staining to assess the vasculature morphology, com-
paring MOCK and infected brains at E15.5. ZIKV was detected by immunohistochemistry for 4G2 flavivirus 
envelope protein in the embryonic cerebral cortex at the proliferative zones and endothelial cells (Fig. 3A,B and 
Supplementary Fig. 1A,B). The vascular analysis of skeletonised IB4 stained blood vessels showed no overall 
change in the blood vessel number per field (875 ×
 375 µm2) within ZIKV infected cerebral cortex compared to 
MOCK (Fig. 3C,E). However, ZIKV infected brains displayed a significant decrease in the number of branches 
(Fig. 3F) and branch length (p = 0.0004; ZIKV −
14.3 µm ± 0.9 µm, n = 3; MOCK −
26.3 µm ± 0.7 µm, n = 3; 
Fig. 3G). At P2, the number of vessels and branches was not significantly different between ZIKV infected and 
MOCK brains (Fig. 3H,I). In contrast, at P2 there was still a significant (p = 0.03) reduction in branch length 
between MOCK (268.1 μ
m ± 0.013, n = 3) and ZIKV infected brains (219.7 μ
m ± 0.005, n = 3, Fig. 3J). To assess 
how much of the cortex was covered by vasculature at E15.5, we quantified the percentage of cortical tissue 
stained by IB4. Interestingly, there was a significant reduction in the proportion of vascular staining in the

vessels and nestin to label cortical progenitors, we observed a reduction of the co-localization of these markers in 
ZIKV brains compared to MOCK ones (Fig. 3K,L,P). To analyse the effect of infection with ZIKV on blood ves-
sels in other tissues impaired by ZIKV, we collected and flattened retinas from P7 eyes. The pattern of vasculature

displayed a similar reduction in vasculature as in cortex (Fig. 4A,B). We also examined E15.5 placenta three days 
after infection and stained blood vessels with IB4. Similarly, ZIKV was co-localized with the endothelial cells 
(Supplementary Fig. 1C,D) and the analysis of IB4, laminin and CD31 revealed a reduction of vessels’ intensity 
and density in the placenta tissue (Fig. 4C,F and Supplementary Fig.E-H).
Angiogenic proteins are deregulated by congenital infection with ZIKV. 
The preciding data sug-
gest that blood vessel development is perturbed by ZIKV infection. Since this process is regulated by multiple 
molecules, we performed a proteomics array for angiogenic related proteins. From 53 tested proteins, we iden-
tified 47 present in both MOCK and ZIKV infected cerebral cortex, although at different levels. In fact, ZIKV 
infection increased the expression of 45 angiogenic related molecules (Fig. 5A,B). Some of these proteins were 
previously described as having additional roles in brain development (Fig. 5C) such as neurogenesis, including 
Serpinf1 and DLL415,16. Overall, 20% of the altered proteins have at least a partial role in neurogenesis. However, 
genes involved in angiogenic processes, which include cell differentiation, migration, chemotaxis, and adhesion

combine together to represent approximately 45% of the altered genes. Altogether, this data suggests that con-
genital infection of ZIKV deregulates the balance of trophic and regulatory proteins that could contribute to the 
disruption of neurogenesis and angiogenesis in the developing cerebral cortex.
Discussion
This study characterizes a new model of ZIKV-induced microcephaly like syndrome in mouse and identifies 
changes in the vasculature as part of the disease aetiology. We demonstrated that ZIKV infection at E12.5 in 
Ifng−
/− mice causes a reduction in brain size at P2. At E15.5 (3dpi), reductions in neurogenesis and area of both 
the progenitor zone and developing cortical plate were associated with a pattern of delayed vascular development.
Previous studies have demonstrated that direct ZIKV infection and death of the NPCs led to the reduced brain 
size4,8. Indeed, microcephaly can result from defective neurogenesis, an essential part of cortical development. 
However, cortical development is a complex phenomenon, which is regulated by a multitude of parallel processes, 
signalling factors, and extrinsic factors all occurring in tightly defined timescales. Therefore, the dysregulation of 
any of these processes could result in defective neurogenesis leading to cortical malformation. Cortical vascular 
plexus development can start as early as E11 in the mouse and is essential for the delivery of nutrients and regu-
lating the expression of signalling molecules, which has an impact on neurogenesis10,11. The cortical blood supply 
develops from two plexi, the ventricular plexus and the pial plexus12,13. This study, along with previous research17, 
showed that ZIKV also infects the endothelial cells of the cortical vasculature in addition to neural progenitors. In 
particular, the vascular structure is abnormal in ZIKV infected mouse brains, especially in the ventricular zone, 
Figure 5. ZIKV infection alters cerebral cortex angiogenesis proteins levels. Cerebral cortex tissue extracts 
from three E15.5 embryos from three different litters of each experimental group were evaluated by 
angiogenesis proteomic profile. From 53 possible angiogenesis-related proteins, we identified 47 both present 
in MOCK and ZIKV infected brains (A). ZIKV infection increased the levels of 45 molecules (B). Besides their 
previously described role on angiogenesis, many identified proteins also contribute to other biological processes 
(C), including neurogenesis (19.66%), cell migration (16.85%), CNS development (7.87%) and inflammatory 
responses (8.43%).

where there is also evidence of reduction of neuronal proliferation. The blood-brain barrier, specialisation of 
the cerebral endothelial cells that limit paracellular diffusion and transcellular transport, have been suggested to 
regulate the entry of most flaviviruses18. However, blood vessels are the pathway of ZIKV entrance into the brain 
parenchyma18,19, suggesting that the virus might have direct effects on the vasculature as well as other neural 
tissues. Some disruption of the blood-brain barrier has also been reported following ZIKV infection20, which 
may facilitate viral entry. However, the barrier changes described to date have not been quantified and were only 
described in a model of pathogenesis with substantial lethality in the postnatal period. Mladinish and colleagues18 
suggest that in their primary human brain endothelial cells, ZIKV does not result in death of the cells or altered 
permeability. Instead, endothelial cells appear to act as a reservoir for viral replication, as well as contributing to 
inflammatory signaling following infection.
We found that following ZIKV injection, there was a general increase of the levels of angiogenic protein (with 
a few notable exceptions, such as CXCL4, VEGF), within the developing cortex. During angiogenesis, the balance 
of these different molecules is of particular importance, and in this context, there is a clear interplay between 
‘normal’ and ‘abnormal’ growth and stabilisation signals. In the MOCK animals, there is a high concentration of 
VEGF and PDGF-BB proteins in the brain, which would promote endothelial cell proliferation and the recruit-
ment of endothelial precursor cells and pericytes to the extending vascular network21,22. Following ZIKV injec-
tion, however, there is a substantial increase in Ang1, Ang3 and, to a lesser extent, endostatin and PEDF, which 
all suggest an anti-angiogenic status22. The exact effects and contribution of each of these proteins will need to be 
further elucidated. For instance, combined VEGF and Ang2 have a different effect on the development of vascular 
networks than either one individually23. The changes in protein concentration observed at E15.5 are likely to be a 
combination of the response of the blood vessels to ZIKV infection, as inflammation is a key regulator of angio-
genesis24, and of the oxygen levels of the tissue.
Dividing progenitors are found in close proximity to blood vessels in the SVZ, and other neurovascular niches 
in the brain13,25,26. Changes in vascular development can result in altered neural patterning12 and, in addition, 
endothelial cells produce trophic factors which have important roles in neurogenesis27–30. While there is no dis-
pute that ZIKV has a direct impact on human NPCs in the brain3,8,19, our study shows that a vascular defect may 
also contribute to ZIKV induced microcephaly. ZIKV infection of the endothelial cells may induce cortical vas-
culature abnormalities, which may further add to the abnormal neurogenesis.
In our murine model of ZIKV infection, we observed a more severe vascular developmental alteration at E15.5 
that was much less prominent by P2, in contrast to the microcephaly-like phenotype, that was strongest at P2. In 
spite of this recovery, there was still a reduced vessel branch length present at P2 in ZIKV infected brains at birth. 
This suggests that ZIKV congenital infection promotes an acute insult that delays the vascular development dur-
ing critical stages of neurogenesis that was partially recovered by birth. Such a delayed developmental progress is 
common in developmental disorders31, where the long-term consequences of the early disruption continue more 
subtly. The alterations in the vasculature in the cortical germinal zone might be just the “tip of the iceberg” in the 
ZIKV congenital infection. Our observations on the altered vascular development in the placenta and the retina 
suggest that ZIKV congenital infection might have a very general effect on the developing embryonic vasculature. 
It is important to note that the placenta produces several proinflammatory cytokines and expresses cytokine 
receptors. Several insults, such as LPS, bacterial and viral infection, including ZIKV, induce cytokine expression 
in the placenta impacting the fetus32,33.
The mouse model used in this study was produced by infection of ZIKV (105 PFU), injected intravenously 
(IV) into the Ifng−
/− pregnant dam. In previous studies, a variety of ZIKV titres within the range of 103–1012 PFU 
administered through different methods of systemic administration were employed to generate mouse models for 
ZIKV infection34, but these methods have often led to death of the young mice or whole body size reduction8,35–38. 
Here, the mouse model produced pups with smaller brains mimicking microcephaly-like phenotype that sur-
vived birth, thus enabling the opportunity to perform postnatal studies. Our results indicate that in the Ifng−
/− 
model, the embryos are not affected homogeneously by congenital ZIKV infection. Using PCR to detect viral 
loads in pup brains, we found that only some infected specimens were negative. Similarly, some morphological 
outcomes, such as skull size, also showed heterogeneous results. This non-uniform response to ZIKV infection in 
the production of microcephaly-like phenotypes has been reported by other authors, especially in models where 
the animals were not completely immunological deficient7,39. Therefore, Ifng−
/− mice seem to be appropriate to 
model an effective but also realistic ZIKV congenital infection. It would be interesting to investigate whether Ifn 
gene polymorphism resulting in lower cytokine levels in humans is associated with an increased prevalence of 
ZIKV induced microcephaly. Clustering patterns of microcephaly following ZIKV infection in Brazil hints at 
the possible role of environmental and socio-economic issues like availability of pregnancy supplements, age at 
pregnancy, vaccinations, and sanitation40. Our study suggests that ZIKV may cause additional angiogenic defects 
that could contribute to the reduced neurogenesis in the ventricular zone and the later reduced cortical volume. 
While the link between ZIKV infection, disruption of vascular development and reduced proliferation of neural 
progenitors needs to be further investigated, this is a novel mechanism that has a potential for direct therapeutic 
targeting.

dislocation (adults) or decapitation (embryos and pups). Samples were collected from embryos at three-days 
post-infection (dpi, E15.5) or from pups at the 2nd postnatal day (P2) and fixed by immersion in 4% paraformal-
dehyde (PFA, Sigma-Aldrich, USA) for 72 hours, then washed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).
Assessment of brain size and weight. 
Images of whole brains obtained from three litters, n = 12 (3 
mocks and 9 ZIKV), were taken with a light microscope (Leica, DFC490) from a dorsal view. Length and width 
of the cortex were measured (in pixels) using ImageJ at the longest (rostro-caudal) and widest points of the cortex 
(Fig. 1A,B). To compare changes in brain mass, whole brains were weighed (µg) on standard laboratory scales 
(AND, HM-120). To better characterize microcephaly-like phenotype in this animal model, we also performed 
micro computed tomography (mCT) of the skulls at P2. Images were obtained using a Bruker SkyScan1173 mCT 
scanner with the following parameters: isotropic voxel size of 8.55 µm, 30 kV and 180 µA. From these images, 
three dimensional reconstructions were built using Amira software, and the position of a set of 42 bilateral ana-
tomical points (landmarks) was registered in each specimen as described by Gonzalez et al.41,42. From these reg-
istered landmarks we obtained comprehensive measures of skull size (centroid size) as defined by Bookstein43.
Tissue Preparation for Fluorescent Immunohistochemistry. 
Brains and placenta for immuno-
histochemistry were embedded in 5% agarose (Bioline), in 0.1 M PBS, cut coronally at 50 µm with a vibrating 
microtome (VT1000S, Leica, Germany), and stored in 0.01% PBS-azide. At least three brains or placentas from 
either MOCK or ZIKV-infected groups from different litters, and three sections per brain or placenta were used 
for all immunohistochemistry experiments. Sections were washed in 0.1M PBS, incubated in blocking solution 
(2 hours, 2% donkey serum (Sigma-Aldrich) and 0.2% Triton-X100 (BDH) in 0.1M PBS), and then primary 
antibodies (rat anti-CTIP2, Abcam ab18465; rabbit anti-Pax6, Biolegend 901301; rabbit anti-pH3, Upstate 
06-570; mouse anti-flavivirus group antigen, Millipore MAB10216) at 4 °C overnight. Sections were washed and 
incubated with fluorescent-conjugated secondary antibody (2 hours, either donkey anti-rabbit AlexaFluor568, 
Invitrogen A21206; donkey anti-mouse AlexaFluor647, Invitrogen A31571; donkey anti-goat AlexaFluor488, 
Molecular Probes, A-11055; or donkey anti-rat AlexaFluor488, Invitrogen A21208 at 1:500 dilution) and stained 
with 4′
-6-diamino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, Invitrogen, 1:1000 dilution in 0.1M PBS) nuclear counterstain. Retinas 
were removed at P7, flattened and fixed with cold (−
20 °C) methanol. Free-floating retina, brain and placenta 
sections stained with Isolectin B4 (IB4, Vector, FL1201, 1:200) were incubated with the stain for 2 hours before 
DAPI counterstain.
Imaging, quantifications and Statistical Analysis. 
Fluorescently labelled sections were imaged using 
a fluorescence microscope (Leica, DFC500) and a confocal laser-scanning microscope (LSM710, Zeiss). ImageJ 
was used to determine the area (in pixel units) covered by ventricular and subventricular zones and cortical layers 
on fluorescence microscopy images of DAPI counterstained samples. Pax6 and Ctip2 immunohistochemistry 
were used to define the radial glial cells and newly emerging cell layers of the cortical plate, and the numbers of 
immunoreactive cells were quantified. Pax6+, Ctip2+ and pH3+ number of cells were counted in three sections 
of at least three different brains of each experimental group. We used the field of view of 20X for Pax6 and Ctip2 
and 40X for Ph3 analysis. Analysis of the cortical vasculature was carried out in three sections of at least three 
different brains from different litters stained with IB4. Images were acquired using a confocal microscope as 
described above. To determine vessel characteristics, the threshold tool (ImageJ) was used to produce binary 
images, and images were de-noised (using the ImageJ ‘Despeckle’ tool) to remove excessive non-specific stain 
signal. The width of vessels (µm) was determined using the histogram tool to measure the x-axis distance between 
the margins of each vessel, perpendicular to the pial surface. Vessel area was determined by the proportion of 
vascular staining within each cortical region. Skeletonised structure of the blood vessels was obtained using the 
ImageJ plugin ‘skeletonise’
, to quantify vessel number, branch number, and branch length. All data were analysed 
with Excel or GraphPad Prism. Statistical evaluation was performed by Student’s unpaired t-test. Data in graphs 
are presented as mean ± SEM. *p ≤
 0.05, **p ≤
 0.01, ***p ≤
 0.001, ****p ≤
 0.0001.
Proteome profile array. 
Cerebral cortex tissue extracts from E15.5 MOCK or ZIKV infected embryos 
were processed for analysis of angiogenesis-related proteins levels by using the Proteome Profiler™ Mouse 
Angiogenesis Antibody Array kit (R&D Systems) that identifies 53 angiogenesis-related proteins. Proteome assay 
and analysis were performed according to manufacturer’s instructions.
Viral detection. 
RNA was extracted from brain, eye and spleen tissue samples using RNeasy Plus Mini Kit 
(QIAgen), following the manufacturer’s recommendations. Viral RNA was quantified using One Step Taqman 
RT-qPCR (Thermo Fisher Scientific) on a 7500 Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems) with primers and 
probe designed by Lanciotti and collaborators44. ZIKV copies were calculated by interpolation onto an internal 
standard curve formed of eight 10-fold serial dilutions of a synthetic ZIKV RNA based on the Asian lineage. The 
ZIKV quantification was displayed in ZIKV RNA copies per gram of tissue.
