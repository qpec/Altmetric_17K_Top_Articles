One Sentence Summary: In cerebral small vessel disease, endothelial dysfunction leads to 
white matter vulnerability which is reversible in a rat model with endothelial stabilizing drugs.  
 
Abstract: Dementia is a major social and economic problem for our ageing population. One of 
the commonest causes of dementia in the elderly is cerebral small vessel disease (SVD). 
Magnetic resonance scans of SVD patients typically show white matter abnormalities, but we do 
not understand the mechanistic pathological link between blood vessels and white matter myelin 
damage. Hypertension is suggested as the cause of sporadic SVD, but a recent alternative 
hypothesis invokes dysfunction of the blood brain barrier as the primary cause. Here, in a rat 
model of SVD, we show that endothelial cell (EC) dysfunction is the first change in development 
of the disease. Dysfunctional ECs secrete heat shock protein 90-alpha, which blocks 
oligodendroglial differentiation, contributing to impaired myelination. Treatment with EC-
stabilizing drugs reversed these EC and oligodendroglial pathologies in the rat model. EC and 
oligodendroglial dysfunction were also observed in humans with early, asymptomatic SVD 
pathology. We identified a loss-of-function mutation in ATPase11B which caused the EC 
dysfunction in the rat SVD model, and a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in ATPase11B 
that was associated with white matter abnormalities in humans with SVD. We show that EC 
dysfunction is a cause of SVD white matter vulnerability and provide a therapeutic strategy to 
treat and reverse SVD in the rat model which may also be of relevance to human SVD.  
 
 
 Main text: 
Introduction 
One of the biggest challenges currently facing society is the increasing number of people with 
dementia as the population ages. Cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) affects the small 
perforating arterioles in the brain and is the leading cause of vascular dementia (1, 2). SVD also 
contributes to and worsens the symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) (2), and is responsible 
for up to 45% of dementias. Monogenic forms and some sporadic cases of SVD occur at young 
ages, which supports SVD as a disease rather than simply being a consequence of aging (3). In 
addition to dementia, SVD causes cognitive impairment, gait and balance problems (2, 4, 5), and 
trebles the risk of stroke (6). Its diagnosis relies on clinical presentation of lacunar stroke, or 
cognitive or gait/balance problems with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) features such as 
white matter hyperintensities (WMH) (7). These WMH are associated with cognitive decline in 
SVD (6), and pathological diagnosis of SVD relies on characteristic changes such as 
lipohyalinosis (asymmetric areas of small vessel fibrosis associated with foam cells and leakage 
of plasma proteins) and myelin loss (8) indicating that white matter damage plays an important 
role in disease pathogenesis.  
The risk of sporadic SVD is increased by typical vascular risk factors such as hypertension, 
diabetes and smoking (9-11). Despite one third of people over the age of 80 having some signs 
of SVD (12), there are currently no established SVD therapies (13). Most treatments tested in 
clinical trials so far have focused on blood pressure reduction (13), although 30% of SVD 
patients are normotensive (14). Alternatively, some evidence now suggests that blood brain 
barrier (BBB) changes may cause SVD (15, 16). The BBB prevents unwanted cells and solutes 
in the blood from entering the brain parenchyma and is made of endothelial cells (ECs), 
pericytes, astrocyte end-feet, and junctions between these cells (17). Disruption of the BBB is 
 found in SVD (16, 18), but it is unclear if this causes any observed pathological changes, or is 
secondary to them. 
We sought mechanisms linking vascular changes with white matter pathology by studying the 
earliest pathological features of SVD in a rat model and human tissue. We show that the first 
pathological change is EC dysfunction which occurs before the onset of hypertension or clinical 
signs. We identify both an upstream genetic cause of this EC dysfunction and a secreted 
downstream effector, impacting surrounding white matter. We also show that drug treatment to 
stabilize EC dysfunction in a SVD model reverses the endothelial and oligodendroglial 
pathologies, suggesting a new therapeutic strategy. 
Results 
To study the early changes in SVD development, we used the stroke-prone spontaneously 
hypertensive rat [SHRSP; subsequently referred to as disease model (DM)]. This is an inbred rat 
strain known to be a relevant rodent model of human sporadic SVD (19, 20). These DM rats are 
hypertensive from six weeks, show classical SVD pathology from eight weeks, and suffer strokes 
from twenty weeks of age (20-24). As controls we used the parent strain of the DM rat, Wistar 
Kyoto rats (WKY), from a colony maintained in parallel. For human tissue, we used brains 
obtained from people (aged 24-58) who had died suddenly without SVD symptoms but whose 
brains were found to have early SVD pathology upon post-mortem examination (table S1).  
BBB changes are found early in a rat SVD model and in humans with pre-symptomatic 
SVD  
Previous work had found BBB changes in DM rats at five weeks of age, predating hypertension 
(25). In deep white matter areas typically affected by SVD pathology, we found that the earliest 
pathological change seen by immunofluorescence (at four weeks of age) was a decrease in the 
number of blood vessels expressing claudin-5, the key tight junction protein (TJP) of the BBB, 
indicative of an altered BBB (26) (Fig. 1A-D, I). There was also a trend to reduction of the 
 absolute amount of claudin-5 protein in DM brain at 5 weeks, although this was not statistically 
significant (fig. S1). However, this alteration in claudin-5 expression did not lead to a functional 
leakage of the BBB to a large dextran tracer in 5-week-old DM rats (fig. S2). In the deep white 
matter of human brains with early stage SVD, we found a similar decrease in blood vessels with 
colocalized claudin-5 expression (Fig. 1E-I). We found no differences in other components of 
the BBB, including pericytes, astrocytes, astrocyte end-feet, and blood vessel density between 
DM and control rats, or between the human pre-symptomatic cases and age-relevant controls 
(fig. S3). 
OPCs are increased in a rat SVD model and humans with pre-symptomatic SVD  
Subsequent to the BBB changes, we found an increase in oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) 
in the deep white matter in the DM rat at 5 weeks of age (more Olig2+ Nogo-A- cells; Fig. 1J-
L), and also in the human pre-symptomatic cases (Fig. 1J, M-N). This increase was due to both 
a block in OPC differentiation to mature oligodendrocytes (fewer mature Olig2+ Nogo-A+ 
oligodendrocytes; Fig. 1O), and an increase in OPC proliferation (Fig. 1P, fig. S4). We also 
found an increase in the number of macrophages/microglia at five weeks of age in the DM rats 
(fig. S5A-B, E) and in the human cases (fig. S5C-E), suggestive of a secondary immune 
response.  
Early changes occur without hypertension or leakage through the BBB  
The order of these changes in the DM rat suggests that an early change in the ECs contributes to 
the later white matter changes and occurs well before the rats become hypertensive. However, 
the lack of a functional leak in DM rats in vivo at this early time point suggests that early white 
matter pathology does not result from substances in the blood leaking through an impaired BBB. 
To confirm this, we cultured brain slices from neonatal DM rats ex vivo for five weeks, in the 
absence of blood flow and blood pressure. We observed the same changes as at 5 weeks in vivo: 
a reduction in claudin-5 protein expression (Fig. 2A-B), an increase in OPC number (more 
 Olig2+ Nogo-A- cells; Fig. 2C-E), and a reduction in mature oligodendrocytes (fewer Olig2+ 
Nogo-A+ oligodendrocytes; Fig. 2F). As these data confirm that neither BBB leakage nor 
hypertension caused the early myelin pathology in this model, we next considered endothelial 
dysfunction as a mechanism for the pathology. 
DM rats and human SVD brains have dysfunctional ECs 
Endothelial dysfunction is commonly defined as a reduction in the bioavailability of nitric oxide 
(NO) in an endothelial cell (EC) (27). This may be due to either a reduction in NO production 
by endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), or an increase in NO sequestration by superoxide. 
At 3 weeks of age, before tight junction changes are seen in blood vessels, brains of DM rats 
already showed reduced eNOS compared to controls (Fig. 2G-H). Dysfunctional ECs also have 
a high proliferation rate (28, 29), and we found more proliferating ECs in both 3-week-old DM 
rat tissue and diseased human brains compared to controls (Fig. 2I-M). To determine whether 
this dysfunction was cell autonomous, we isolated and cultured brain microvascular endothelial 
cells (BMECs) from neonatal DM and control rats and found that DM cells produced less NO 
(Fig. 2N). DM BMECS also showed reduced tight junction integrity. Control BMECs expressed 
zonula occludens 1 (ZO-1) (a marker of tight junctions) and claudin-5 (a marker of mature tight 
junctions) in their cell membranes. In comparison, DM BMECs expressed ZO-1 normally but 
showed reduced claudin-5 localization in their membranes (Fig. 2O-R). 
Dysfunctional ECs reduce OPC maturation and increase OPC proliferation 
To investigate whether dysfunctional ECs secrete factors that cause the white matter changes in 
the DM rat, we collected conditioned media from DM BMECs and added it to in vitro cultures 
of wild-type OPCs.  Treatment with DM BMEC conditioned media led to a reduction in 
maturation of wild-type OPCs (more immature NG2+ OPCs, fewer mature MBP+ 
oligodendrocytes; Fig. 3A-D) and more proliferation (Fig. 3E-G) compared to wild-type OPCs 
grown in control BMEC conditioned media. Furthermore, ex vivo slice cultures grown in DM 
 BMEC conditioned media contained more OPCs than slices grown in control BMEC conditioned 
media (Fig. 3H-J). Therefore, secreted factors from DM BMECs affect oligodendroglia biology, 
blocking OPC maturation and increasing their proliferation. This correlates with the findings 
seen in tissue sections from young DM rat brains, and pre-symptomatic diseased human brains. 
HSP90α secreted by ECs mediates the reduction in OPC maturation 
To identify these soluble factors secreted from DM BMECs, we used a forward phase antibody 
microarray with >1300 antibodies against select proteins. One protein expressed more in DM 
compared to control BMEC conditioned media was heat shock protein 90 alpha (HSP90α) (fig. 
S6), a chaperone protein highly expressed in all brain cell types. We confirmed increased protein 
in DM BMEC conditioned media by western blot (Fig. 3K-L) and saw a trend to an increase on 
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)(P=0.05) (Fig. 3M). Treatment of OPCs with 
recombinant HSP90α (rHSP90α) decreased OPC maturation (more immature NG2+ OPCs, fewer 
mature MBP+ oligodendrocytes; Fig. 3N-Q), mirroring the effect seen with DM BMEC 
conditioned media, but had no effect on OPC proliferation compared to controls (fig. S7A-C). A 
blocking antibody specific to HSP90α abrogated the DM BMEC conditioned media-induced 
maturation defects (Fig. 3R-V), but again OPC proliferation was unchanged (fig. S7D-G). These 
data show that HSP90α secreted by DM BMECs causes the block in maturation of OPCs, but is 
not responsible for the proliferation effect. Furthermore, we found more of the cleaved, secreted 
form of HSP90α (30) in DM rat brains (Fig. 3W-X) and in some diseased human brains (Fig. 
3W,Y), suggesting that a similar mechanism downstream of endothelial dysfunction also occurs 
in human SVD. 
Drugs which ameliorate endothelial dysfunction reverse OPC changes in vivo 
We next investigated whether reducing endothelial dysfunction improves white matter pathology 
in vivo. We treated DM rats with drugs reported to reduce endothelial dysfunction: simvastatin, 
a cholesterol lowering drug; perindopril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI); or 
 cilostazol, a phosphodiesterase inhibitor (31-34). We dosed animals from five weeks old, a time 
point at which both endothelial and OPC pathologies are present, to adulthood at twelve weeks 
(Fig. 4A). These animals were compared to untreated WKY rats, untreated DM rats, and animals 
treated with a combination drug [hydralazine and hydrochlorothiazide (H+H)] that lowers blood 
pressure but does not alter endothelial dysfunction, as a control for the blood pressure reduction 
expected with perindopril (Fig. 4B; table S2). Blood pressures were monitored weekly, and 
increased in all rats over time (as expected as they mature to adulthood) (35) but clustered into 
two groups: one with high blood pressure (untreated DM rats and rats treated with simvastatin 
or cilostazol) and the other with normal blood pressure (DM rats treated with the anti-
hypertensives perindopril or H+H and untreated WKY rats) (Fig. 4C). 
At twelve weeks, we examined the brains for signs of endothelial dysfunction and white matter 
changes. Simvastatin and perindopril significantly reduced EC proliferation (P<0.001 for both) 
(Fig. 4D-E, L) and significantly increased mature TJs in the DM rats (P<0.05 for both) (Fig. 4F-
G, M), confirming that these drugs improve endothelial dysfunction. Cilostazol showed trend 
effects only in the same direction. Simvastatin, perindopril and cilostazol reversed the increase 
in OPCs seen in untreated DM rats (P<0.001, P<0.001 and P<0.01 respectively) (Fig. 4H-I, N). 
In the case of simvastatin and perindopril, this is by both reducing the OPC differentiation block 
(P<0.001 for both) (Fig. 4O) and reducing OPC proliferation (P<0.01 for simvastatin, P<0.05 
for perindopril) (Fig. 4J-K, P).  Cilostazol only showed a significant increase in mature 
oligodendrocytes (P<0.001) (Fig. 4P). Furthermore, blinded ranking of the quality of myelin in 
the deep white matter areas showed a pattern of less myelin rarefaction in DM rats treated with 
drugs reducing EC dysfunction, with a significant reduction  for simvastatin (P<0.01) (Fig. 4Q).  
These data demonstrate that improving endothelial dysfunction reverses the oligodendroglial 
changes in DM rats in vivo, further demonstrating that these are secondary to endothelial 
dysfunction. These drugs act via different pharmacological pathways, suggesting that endothelial 
 dysfunction reversal itself is the key therapeutic mechanism. This effect is also independent of 
blood pressure, as normotensive DM rats treated with H+H showed little improvement, and 
hypertensive DM rats treated with simvastatin and cilostazol showed significant improvements 
in pathology. 
DM rats have a homozygous deletion in Atp11b 
We next sought to identify the cause of the endothelial dysfunction in our inbred DM rats. We 
reanalyzed published genomic array sequencing data of the DM rat (SHRSP), the spontaneously 
hypertensive rat (SHR, which is its closest related strain and develops hypertension but does not 
show signs of SVD or stroke), and the control strain [the Wistar Kyoto rat (WKY)] (36). As a 
first pass analysis, we examined the lists of frameshift mutations and single nucleotide variants 
that introduce stop codons, as these would be expected to lead to a truncated protein. We selected 
genes with homozygous mutations occurring in SHRSP but not in SHR, with the assumption that 
genes mutated in both contribute to the hypertensive phenotype common to both strains, not the 
SVD phenotype unique to SHRSP. We then filtered this resulting list of 32 genes further (Fig. 
5A) using ENSEMBL’s Variant Effect Predictor tool (37) to select mutations resulting in a 
truncated protein, the Allen Brain Atlas (38) to select only those genes expressed in the brain, 
and the Barres Brain RNA-Seq database (39) to select genes expressed in brain ECs, as our 
earlier results demonstrated that the mutation which causes endothelial dysfunction is cell 
autonomous. This reduced the list to six genes. Using Sanger sequencing, only one gene was 
confirmed to have the predicted mutation present in an exon (hence coding and leading to a 
truncated protein): ATPase, Class VI, type 11B (Atp11b) (Fig. 5B). By western blot we showed 
that this mutation causes a total loss of ATP11B protein rather than the predicted truncated 
protein (Fig. 5C). 
Knockdown of Atp11b in ECs phenocopies DM BMECs 
 To investigate whether deletion of Atp11b causes the endothelial dysfunction observed in our 
DM rats, we knocked down the gene using siRNA in an endothelial cell line (bEND.3), achieving 
a 61% ± 20% knockdown (KD) of protein (Fig. 5D-E). Atp11b-KD bEND.3 cells showed signs 
of endothelial dysfunction, with a higher proliferation rate (Fig. 5F-H) and formation of less 
mature TJs (Fig. 5I-L) than cells treated with non-targeting siRNA. Treatment of OPCs with 
conditioned media collected from Atp11b-KD bEND.3 cells caused a block in OPC maturation 
(more immature NG2+ OPCs, and fewer mature MBP+ oligodendrocytes; Fig. 5M-P) and 
increased proliferation (Fig. 5Q-S). Similarly, conditioned media from human endothelial cells 
treated with siRNAs to knockdown ATP11B led to a block in rat OPC maturation (more NG2+ 
OPCs, fewer mature MBP+ oligodendrocytes, proportional to amount of knockdown) (fig. S8). 
[Of note, the commercial human cerebral endothelial cell lines HBEC5i and hCMEC/d3 did not 
express endothelial markers and therefore were not used (fig. S9)]. Furthermore, Atp11b-KD 
bEND.3 cells secreted more HSP90α compared to those treated with non-targeting siRNA (Fig. 
5T-U), linking the upstream and downstream pathways, and suggesting a similar mechanism of 
action to DM BMECs. 
A SNP in ATP11B is associated with WMH in humans 
To determine if ATP11B is relevant to SVD in humans, we obtained summary data from a 
previous study which investigated the genome-wide association of single nucleotide 
polymorphisms (SNPs) with WMH burden assessed by MRI (40). This study included 17,936 
individuals of European descent from 29 population-based cohorts, as part of the Cohorts for 
Heart 
and 
Aging 
Research 
in 
Genomic 
Epidemiology 
(CHARGE) 
consortium 
(http://www.chargeconsortium.com). SNPs were imputed from the 1000 Genomes reference and 
WMH burden was quantified on MRI by either automated segmentation or a visual rating scale. 
We looked at 304 SNPs within ATP11B and found seven SNPs which were significantly 
associated with WMH (P<0.05; fig. S10). After correcting for multiple testing, using spectral 
 decomposition to determine the number of independent SNPs tested using the 1000 Genomes 
reference as a measure of linkage disequilibrium (41), we found one intronic SNP which was 
associated with WMH burden: rs148771930 (P=0.00025).  
We used the Genotype-Tissue Expression Portal (GTEx) (http://www.gtexportal.org) to try to 
identify expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) associated with this SNP but none was 
identified. We also interrogated Regulome DB database46 (http://www.regulomedb.org/) to 
identify regulatory DNA elements in non-coding and intergenic regions of the genome in normal 
cell lines and tissues. Minimal binding evidence was identified (Regulome DB score = 6), but 
this included a position weight matrix motif and evidence of histone modifications, suggesting 
that the SNP may be involved in gene regulation. Although the functional effect of this SNP is 
not clear, its association with WMH in this dataset suggests that ATP11B may also be important 
in the pathogenesis of the human disease. 
A summary of our model is shown in fig. S11. 
Discussion 
Here, we demonstrated that endothelial dysfunction is an early precipitant of disease 
development in a rat model of SVD and a sample of humans with sporadic SVD. We identified 
a deletion in Atp11b and loss of ATP11B protein as causing endothelial dysfunction, with 
abnormalities of the BBB TJs, increased EC proliferation, and reduction in eNOS and NO. This 
dysfunction led to secretion of factors, including HSP90α, which blocked the maturation of OPCs 
into myelinating oligodendrocytes, consistent with the impairment of myelination and inherent 
vulnerability of white matter to damage seen in adult humans with SVD (42). We also 
demonstrated therapeutic reversal of endothelial dysfunction and associated reduction in white 
matter vulnerability. The early reduction of the BBB TJ markers but lack of tracer leakage (along 
with the brain slice culture experiments) showed that leakage of substances through the BBB is 
 not important for initial SVD pathology in our model. However, it is highly likely that BBB 
leakage is important for later worsening of pathology, as fibrinogen is found around the blood 
vessels both in late human disease and in the rat SVD model.   
There are many possible upstream causes of endothelial dysfunction in SVD, both environmental 
and genetic. The common environmental risk factors for SVD, such as hypertension, smoking 
and diabetes, can induce endothelial dysfunction (43-45), reconciling the epidemiological 
associations of SVD. SVD patients have elevated plasma concentrations of soluble biomarkers 
of endothelial dysfunction, such as ICAM-1 (46), and impaired vasodilation in response to 
vasoactive challenges (47). Animal models of monogenic forms of SVD [such as cerebral 
autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy 
(CADASIL) and COL4A1 mutations] show reduced vascular reactivity, a sign of endothelial 
dysfunction (48, 49). Genetic polymorphisms in the gene coding for eNOS, which reduce eNOS 
activity, are associated with SVD (50, 51).  
We found a mutation in Atp11b as an upstream cause of endothelial dysfunction in the DM rat. 
We confirmed that a knock down of Atp11b or ATP11B in wild-type rodent and human ECs 
induced a similar dysfunctional EC phenotype, including an increase in secretion of HSP90α and 
the secondary effects on OPCs. We also showed that this gene may play a role in human SVD, 
as a SNP in ATP11B was associated with WMH burden. ATP11B is a member of the 
phospholipid flippase family of proteins, responsible for moving phospholipids from the 
outer/luminal leaflet of the plasma or organelle membrane to the inner/cytoplasmic leaflet (52). 
ATP11B specifically is involved in vesicular transport from the trans Golgi network to the 
plasma membrane (53). As the localization of the enzyme eNOS, which shuttles between the 
Golgi and the plasma membrane, is critical for its ability to produce sufficient NO (54), we 
hypothesize but have not yet shown that loss of ATP11B may cause endothelial dysfunction by 
altering the location and hence the activity of eNOS. 
 Downstream of endothelial dysfunction, we showed that HSP90α is an important factor secreted 
from dysfunctional ECs which mediates the oligodendroglial maturation defect. The mechanism 
of action of this OPC maturation block is unknown, but HSP90α, acting through the receptor low 
density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP-1), can regulate the Akt pathway (55), which 
is key in OPC maturation (56, 57). We also saw increased secretion of HSP90α in brains from 
humans with sporadic pre-symptomatic SVD. Therefore, this factor may be downstream of a 
common pathway of endothelial dysfunction from different causes. Although signaling from 
OPCs to ECs has been studied previously (58, 59), there is less reported on the effects of ECs on 
OPCs (60-62), in spite of the increasing evidence that SVD patients have dysfunctional ECs and 
the link between early life predictors of white matter vulnerability and later SVD (42, 63, 64).  
There is MRI evidence of WMH improving in humans with SVD (64). We showed that it was 
possible to reverse endothelial dysfunction and white matter abnormalities with EC-stabilizing 
drugs in the early disease state in the rat SVD model. These drugs include statins, which have 
previously been shown to reduce stroke occurrence in SVD patients, but only in patients with 
elevated cholesterol (65). Endothelial dysfunction and OPC changes were also reversed with 
ACEIs, but not with anti-hypertensives that do not stabilize ECs. Anti-hypertensives have been 
extensively tested in clinical trials in human SVD with mixed results (13), perhaps secondary to 
use of different classes of anti-hypertensive drugs with different effects on endothelial 
dysfunction. In fact, trials that exclusively use ACEIs have shown more positive effects on 
preventing WMH progression in SVD (66). Cilostazol acts on ECs through a third mechanism 
and is currently in early stage clinical trials for SVD (Clinical trial: ISRCTN12580546).  
Our study has raised as yet unanswered questions. We do not yet know whether this pathology 
is reversible later in the disease, when leak of blood components through the BBB is also present 
and whether these treatments may also have an impact on the clinical behavior of the DM rats. 
Although this rat model is well-recognized as an appropriate model of human SVD, it would be 
 interesting to determine whether a similar mechanism of disease is present in other models 
including single gene mutation models mirroring human genetic forms of SVD.  To determine 
whether treatment of humans with drugs which stabilize ECs is associated with a better outcome 
in SVD, it would also be interesting to re-assess stroke clinical trial data comparing EC-
stabilizing treatment groups with other non-EC stabilizing antihypertensives. 
In this study, we show a primary, non-ischemic mechanism of endothelial dysfunction in SVD 
and how this leads to the white matter pathology. We identified a SNP in a gene expressed in 
endothelial cells in humans that may contribute to vulnerability to SVD. We emphasize that 
endothelial cell function consists of more than just controlling blood flow, and that the 
interactions of endothelial cells and other brain cells – in particular, oligodendroglia – are central 
to this disease process. We propose that endothelial dysfunction plays a major, causative role in 
SVD, and that reversal of endothelial dysfunction is therapeutic target for effective treatment for 
this common, disabling, multifactorial disease, with potential for high societal health impact. 
 
Materials and Methods 
Study design 
The overall goal of this study was to determine the mechanism of pathology in cerebral SVD, 
using early pre-symptomatic human tissue and a rat model of the disease. The use of human 
tissue for this study was approved by the Medical Research Council Edinburgh Brain and Tissue 
Bank. This bank has ethical approval to collect tissue for research after informed consent from 
the next of kin. All animal experiments were carried out in line with UK Home Office guidelines, 
under project licences 60/4268 (D.G.), 70/9021 (D.G) and 60/4524 (A.W.). Treatment groups 
were randomly assigned, data were analyzed by blinded observers, and biological replicate 
numbers are stated with each result along with the statistical test used. Stroke-prone 
spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRSP) and matched control strain, Wistar Kyoto rats (WKY), 
 were housed at the University of Glasgow. Animals were fed standard chow and housed in line 
with Home Office guidelines. Breeding SHRSP pairs regularly had their blood pressure tested 
to ensure maintenance of the colony’s phenotype. Male animals were exclusively used for both 
WKY controls and SHRSPs as SHRSP males display a more severe phenotype. Sprague Dawley 
rats housed at the University of Edinburgh were used for wild-type OPCs and slice cultures.  
 
Drug study.  
Animals used in the drug study were individually housed and fed the drugs mixed in with highly 
palatable baby food daily from the age of 5 weeks, after pathology first appears, to the age of 12 
weeks. Animals were treated in 5 batches, with each batch containing one animal randomly 
assigned to each treatment group. Analysis suggested a minimum of 5 animals per treatment 
group to detect an effect size of 35% with 80% power (67). One animal which died before the 
age of 12 weeks without stroke pathology was not included in the final analysis. Drugs were 
administered at doses based on previously published data demonstrating their efficacy at either 
lowering blood pressure or improving endothelial dysfunction when administered orally in rats: 
simvastatin (Sigma): 2 mg/kg/day (32, 33); perindopril (Sigma): 2 mg/kg/day (68); cilostazol 
(Sigma): 60 mg/kg/day (69); hydrochlorothiazide and hydralazine (Sigma): 16 mg/kg/day of 
each (70) (table S2). Blood pressure was measured before treatment, and weekly after treatment 
started, by tail-cuff plethysmography. Myelin rarefaction was ranked blind to group from Luxol 
fast blue/Cresyl violet stained sections. 
 
Human tissue 
Human tissue was provided as paraffin embedded blocks by the MRC Edinburgh Sudden Death 
Brain Bank. All blocks were from the deep white matter of patients who died suddenly without 
clinical signs of SVD. Five blocks were chosen from people who had histopathological signs of 
 SVD upon post-mortem examination by a Neuropathologist (CS) and five matched controls (age: 
control: 46 ± 16 (mean ± standard deviation), SVD: 49 ± 14; post-mortem interval: control: 60 
± 20 hours, SVD: 58 ± 25 hours; percentage male: control: 100%, SVD 60%) were chosen from 
people with no post-mortem signs of SVD. Full details of the human tissue, including 
histopathological signs of SVD, are provided in table S1. Unique identifying numbers (MRC 
database numbers): SD015/08 (BBN2434), SD021/08 (BBN2440), SD034/08 (BBN2453), 
SD014/09 (BBN2473), SD010/10 (BBN2507), SD019/08 (BBN2438), SD020/08 (BBN2439), 
SD022/08 (BBN2481) SD023/08 (BBN2442), SD031/08 (BBN2450).  
 
 
Statistical analysis 
 Graphs were produced and statistics calculated using GraphPad Prism software. Data are 
presented as mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM), comparing at least three biological 
repeats each time. Numbers and type of biological repeats are stated in each graphical figure 
legend. For in vitro studies, an experiment is defined as using cells or slices prepared at different 
times from different animals or passages. For comparisons between two groups, significance was 
determined using a two-tailed Student’s t-test, either paired (for in vitro experiments where the 
control and experimental conditions were run in parallel for each biological repeat) or unpaired. 
For experiments with multiple comparisons, a one-way or two-way ANOVA was used as 
appropriate (repeated measures for in vitro experiments), with post-hoc Bonferroni or Tukey’s 
tests to determine significance between groups. Statistical significance was defined as P<0.05.

 Materials and Methods 
 
Animal housing and husbandry. Stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRSP) and matched 
control strain, Wistar Kyoto rats (WKY), were housed at the University of Glasgow. Animals were fed 
standard chow and housed in line with Home Office guidelines. Breeding SHRSP pairs regularly had 
their blood pressure tested to ensure maintenance of the colony’s phenotype. Male animals were 
exclusively used for both WKY controls and SHRSPs as SHRSP males display a more severe phenotype. 
Sprague Dawley rats housed at the University of Edinburgh were used for wild-type oligodendrocyte 
precursor cells (OPCs) and slice cultures. 
 
Protocols for animal termination. OPCs and slices: postnatal day 0-2 by an overdose of Euthatal (150 
mg/kg; Merial) administered intraperitoneally. Brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMECs): postnatal 
day 5-10 by a rising concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2), as anesthetics can affect endothelial cell 
function (76). Extraction of protein lysates where fresh, frozen tissue was required: age of 5 weeks by an 
overdose of Euthatal (150 mg/kg) and brains extracted and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. 
Immunohistochemistry (IHC): 3, 4 and 5 weeks of age by overdose of Euthatal (150 mg/kg) and 
intracardiac perfusion fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA; Sigma-Aldrich; diluted in phosphate 
buffered saline (PBS; Gibco)). Drug study: 12 weeks of age by overdose of inhaled Isoflurane (5%; 
Zoetis) plus intracardiac perfusion with heparinized (5 U/ml; Wockhardt) PBS, then 4% PFA. 
 
Tracer experiments. In 5 week old animals 5% isoflurane in 1.5 l/min oxygen was used as anesthetic for 
intravenous injection of tracer mix (20 mg/ml Tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate-Dextran (Sigma-
Aldrich T1162) (65-85 kD) in PBS). Animals were allowed to recover for 10 minutes before euthanizing 
with CO2. 
 
Preparation of tissue. IHC: brains were extracted from animals after perfusion fixation and incubated 
overnight in 4% PFA at 4oC, followed by an overnight incubation in 50% ethanol (VWR). Brains were 
 then processed for paraffin embedding by immersion in increasing concentrations of ethanol before being 
embedded in paraffin wax for sectioning at 4 μm. Tracer experiments: brains were extracted from animals 
after perfusion fixation and incubated overnight in 4% PFA at 4oC, followed by incubations in 30% 
sucrose (overnight, 4oC; Sigma-Aldrich) and 50% sucrose (overnight, 4oC). Brains were then embedded 
in optimal cutting temperature compound (OCT; CellPath) and frozen on dry ice. Sections were cut at 8 
μm thickness using a cryostat. 
 
Preparation and maintenance of cells 
Preparation of brain slices. As adapted from a previously published method (71, 72). Brains were 
extracted from rats aged postnatal day 0-2, divided into hemispheres and trimmed to leave only mid-
coronal regions (approximately Bregma +1 to Bregma -4) in L-15 medium (Sigma-Aldrich). This was 
placed onto a McIlwain Tissue Chopper to cut 300 μm thick coronal sections, teased apart, and plated on 
Millipore cell culture inserts (2-4 slices per insert) in 6-well plates with 1 ml slice culture medium 
[minimum essential medium (MEM; Gibco) with 25% Earle’s balanced salt solution (EBSS; Gibco), 25% 
heat inactivated horse serum (HIHS; Gibco), 1.5% glucose (45%; Sigma-Aldrich), 1% glutamax (Gibco), 
1% penicillin/streptomycin (pen/strep; Gibco), 0.5% Fungizone (Invitrogen)] underneath the insert. 
Medium was changed every 2-3 days, and slices were kept in culture for up to 5 weeks. 
 
Preparation of BMECs. As adapted from a previously published method (73). Brains were extracted from 
rats aged postnatal day 5-10 and divided into hemispheres with cerebellum removed in working buffer 
(Hank’s balanced salt solution (HBSS; Life Technologies) with 0.5% bovine serum albumin 
[chromatographically purified; BSA (cp); First Link UK Ltd), 0.5% HEPES (Gibco), 0.5% pen/strep]. 
Meninges were removed before brains were homogenized in 5 ml working buffer with a Dounce tissue 
grinder. Homogenate was isolated from the buffer by centrifugation for 5 minutes at 1800 revolutions per 
minute (RPM) at 4oC. Blood vessel fragments were pelleted from this homogenate by centrifugation in 
22% BSA (cp) for 15 minutes at 3000 RPM at 4oC. The pellet of blood vessel fragments was kept on ice 
in working buffer while the remainder was centrifuged again, for a total of 5 spins. Blood vessel fragments 
were pipetted onto an upside down 70 μm cell strainer to remove single cells then washed into a pooled 
 mixture with working buffer. This was spun down (5 minutes at 1800 RMP, 4oC) and the pellet then 
digested in 10 ml collagenase/dispase (1 mg/ml; Roche) and DNase I type IV (40 μg/ml; Sigma-Aldrich) 
for 45 minutes at 37oC. The resultant dissociated endothelial cells were washed in working buffer and 
plated at 500,000 cells/well on collagen IV and fibronectin (100 μg/ml and 50 μg/ml respectively; Sigma-
Aldrich; overnight, 4oC) coated coverslips in a 24-well plate in 1 ml Endothelial Growth Media-2 Bullet 
Kit [EGM-2; Lonza; Endothelial basal media-2 with 2% Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS), 0.4% hFGF-beta, 
0.1% hEGF, 0.1% VEGF, 0.1% R3-IGF-1, 0.1% Ascorbic acid, 0.1% Gentamycin/Amphotericin-B, 0.1% 
puromycin (Sigma-Aldrich; 5 mg/ml in Dulbecco’s phosphate buffered saline (DPBS; Sigma-Aldrich)] 
and 0.04% hydrocortisone). Cells were grown in 5% carbon dioxide (CO2) and medium was changed 
every 2-3 days. Cultures were used in experiments once they had regions of confluence (10-14 days) and 
were kept for up to 4 weeks. For conditioned media experiments, BMECs were kept in EGM-2 until they 
had regions of confluence before being grown in medium of the target cell type. 
 
Maintenance of mouse brain endothelial cell line, bEND.3. Cells were initially obtained from ATCC 
(catalogue number: CRL-2299) and donated to us by the ffrench-Constant group. Mycoplasma-free cells 
were grown in PDL (5 μg/ml; 1 hour, 37oC) and matrigel (1:40 in water; Corning; 1 hour, 37oC) coated 
vented T75 flasks in culture medium (DMEM, 10% FBS, 1% pen/strep). The cells were plated at 1:10 of 
confluent density and split every week. To split the cells, they were first washed with DPBS and then 
incubated for 10 minutes at 37oC in TVP [1.3 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA; from BDH), 
0.025% trypsin (Gibco), 1% chicken serum (Sigma-Aldrich) in DPBS]. The cells were then agitated and 
diluted in culture medium to stop the digestion, before being further diluted for splitting or plating. For 
experiments, cells were plated at 1:2 of confluent density on PDL and matrigel coated coverslips in 24-
well plates as above. 
Preparation of human endothelial cells. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) (Lonza) were 
cultured in EGM2 media (Lonza) or Human Endothelial-SFM (Thermo) supplemented with 10% FCS, 
10 μg/ml bFGF Recombinant Human Protein (Life Technologies), 10 μg/ml EGF Recombinant Human 
Protein (Life Technologies) and 40 μg/ml Fibronectin from human plasma (Sigma-Aldrich) for a 
maximum of five passages. Human cerebral endothelial cell lines from the HBEC5i and hCMEC/d3 lines 
 cultured immediately after purchase did not express the endothelial markers CD31 (PECAM-1) or CD144 
(VE-Cadherin), possibly due to only later passage numbers being now available and so were abandoned 
(fig. S9).  To check the endothelial cell marker expression, cells were harvested using Trypsin + 0.25% 
EDTA and suspended in PBS + 10% FCS at 1x106 cells/ml, then incubated with antibodies for 30 minutes 
at 4oC to stain for surface markers (CD31-FITC, BD Pharmingen 557508, 1:100), (CD144-PerCYP.Cy5, 
BD Pharmingen 561566), (CD45-V450, BD Pharmingen 560368, 1:100). They were then washed three 
times in PBS + 2% FCS before sorting with the BD FACSAria Fusion flow cytometer and analyzed using 
FlowJo software. 
 
Preparation of OPCs. As based on a previously published method (74). Brains were extracted from rats 
aged postnatal day 0-2 and cortices isolated in MEM. Meninges were removed then cortices were minced 
with fine scissors and digested in MEM with papain (1.2 U/ml; Worthington), L-cysteine (0.24 mg/ml; 
Sigma-Aldrich) and DNase I type IV (40 μg/ml) for 1 hour at 37oC. Cells were diluted in culture medium 
(Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium (DMEM; Gibco) with 10% FBS (Gibco), 1% pen/strep), spun down 
(5 minutes at 1000 RPM), then triturated gently with a 19-gauge needle followed by with a 23-gauge 
needle. Cells were resuspended in culture medium (1.5 brains in 10ml per flask) and grown in vented T75 
flasks coated with poly-D-lysine (PDL; Sigma-Aldrich; 5 μg/ml in water; minimum 1 hour coating, 37oC) 
in 7.5% CO2. 10-14 days after dissection, the vented cap of the flasks was sealed and the flasks were 
placed on an orbital shaker at 240 RPM at 37oC. After 1 hour the medium was removed (containing 
loosely attached microglia), fresh medium added, and the flask returned to the shaker for 16-18 hours. 
This medium was removed and plated on 10cm plastic petri dishes for 20-25 minutes (to remove any 
remaining microglia) after which the cells were spun down (5 minutes at 1000 RPM). Cells were 
resuspended in 5 ml culture medium, gently triturated through a 21-gauge needle, counted, and plated at 
a density of 50,000 cells in a 20 μl droplet of SATO medium [DMEM with 1% pen/strep. 1% ITS 
supplement (Sigma-Aldrich), 16 μg/ml putrescine (Sigma-Aldrich), 400 ng/ml L-thyroxine (Sigma-
Aldrich), 400 ng/ml Tri-iodothyroxine (Sigma-Aldrich), 60 ng/ml progesterone (Sigma-Aldrich), 100  
μg/ml BSA (fraction V) (Sigma-Aldrich)] per PDL coated coverslip in a 24 well plate, topped up to 0.5 
 ml SATO medium per well after 20 minutes at 37oC for cells to stick down. OPCs were grown for 2 days 
and the medium was not changed during this time. 
 
Conditioned media experiments 
Collection of conditioned media. Endothelial cells (HUVECs, BMECs and bEND.3 cells) were grown in 
normal culture medium until reaching confluence and forming tight junctions [~10 days in vitro (DIV) 
for BMECs, 5 DIV for bEND.3 cells]. At this point the media was changed for media of the target culture 
(SATO medium, microglia medium, or slice medium), and this was conditioned for 2-3 days. Media was 
then removed and stored at -20oC until required. Media was filtered with a Millex 0.22 μm syringe filter 
prior to use. 
 
Experiments using conditioned media. Cells grown in conditioned media were prepared as normal. 
Conditioned media was added to OPCs after the step at which they were left for 20 minutes to stick down. 
Cells were left for 2 days in conditioned media before being fixed and analyzed. Slices grown in 
conditioned media were prepared as normal. After preparation, slices were grown in normal media for 1 
day to settle into culture, before the media was changed for 0.8 ml of conditioned media. Media was 
changed for fresh conditioned media every 2-3 days, and slices were grown for 5 weeks before being 
fixed and analyzed. 
 
HSP90α experiments. Recombinant HSP90α (Enzo Life Sciences; ADI-SPP-776-D) was added to media 
at 1 μg/ml, and HSP90α blocking antibody (Enzo Life Sciences; ADI-SPS-771-D) was added to media at 
1.7 μg/ml, as successfully used previously (75). 
 
 
Treatment of bEND.3 cells with siRNA 
After splitting, bEND.3 cells were plated at half confluent density in a 24-well plate (day 0). After 1 DIV, 
the media was changed and cells were transfected with pre-mixed siRNA (5pmol per well; Ambion; 
Atp11b: 
sense: 
GGGUGAUAUUGUUCGUAUAtt; 
Non-targeting:

 UUACGUCGUCGCGUCGUUAtt) and lipofectamine RNAiMAX (3 μl per well; Life Technologies) 
diluted in Opti-MEM (Life Technologies). At 4 DIV, media was changed and cells were again transfected 
with pre-mixed siRNA and lipofectamine RNAiMAX. Cells were fixed and analyzed at 7 DIV. To 
determine the efficiency of the knockdown, protein was extracted from unfixed cells at 7 DIV. 
 
Treatment of human endothelial cells with siRNA 
HUVECs were plated at 105 cells per well in a 6-well plate (day 0). After 1 DIV, the media was changed 
and cells were transfected with pre-mixed siRNA (1 μl per well; Dharmacon ON-TARGETplus 
SMARTpool; ATP11B: sense: GAAGAGGUUACGGCAUA, GCUAAGAACUCUGUGUAUA,

(3μl per well; Life Technologies) diluted in Opti-MEM (Life Technologies). To determine the efficiency 
of the knockdown, protein was extracted from unfixed cells at 7 DIV. 
 
Immunostaining 
Fluorescent immunohistochemistry (IHC) on paraffin embedded rat tissue. Sections were deparaffinized 
by immersion in Xylene (2x 5 minutes; Fisher) and rehydrated by immersion in descending 
concentrations of ethanol (100%, 90%, 80%, 70%, 50%, 30%; 1 minute each) before being immersed in 
PBS. Antigen retrieval was carried out by boiling sections for 15 minutes in a microwave in citrate buffer 
(Vector). Sections were then cooled for 20 minutes in running tap water. Sections were blocked for at 
least 1.5 hours at room temperature in blocking solution [10% heat inactivated horse serum (HIHS), 0.3% 
triton (Fisher) in PBS]. Primary antibodies, diluted in blocking solution, were added and the sections were 
incubated at 4oC overnight in a humid chamber. The sections were washed in PBS (3x 5 minutes), then 
secondary antibodies, diluted in blocking solution, were added for 1.5 hours at room temperature (RT). 
Sections were washed in PBS (3x 5 minutes), Hoechst (VWR) was then added (1 minute), and then 
sections were washed again in PBS (5 minutes). Sections were mounted with Fluoromount (Southern 
Biotech). 
  
Fluorescent IHC on fixed, frozen rat tissue. IHC was carried out as above for paraffin fixed rat tissue, but 
without deparaffinization or antigen retrieval steps. 
 
Fluorescent IHC on paraffin embedded human tissue. IHC was carried out as above for paraffin fixed rat 
tissue, with a signal enhancing step [30-minute incubation with iFX signal enhancer (Molecular Probes), 
5 minute PBS wash] immediately prior to blocking and an autofluorescence quenching step [5 minute 
incubation with Sudan black (0.01% in 70% ethanol; Sigma-Aldrich), 5 minute wash in 70% ethanol, 5 
minute wash in PBS] immediately prior to mounting. 
 
Colorimetric IHC on paraffin embedded human tissue. Sections were deparaffinized and antigen retrieval 
carried out as described above for paraffin embedded rat tissue. Endogenous enzyme activity was blocked 
with Vector Bloxall (10 minutes) then sections were washed with PBS (5 minutes). Sections were blocked 
with 2.5% normal horse serum (NHS; from Vector ImmPress kit; 20 minutes) then washed with PBS (5 
minutes). First primary antibody, diluted in antibody diluent (Spring Bioscience) was incubated overnight 
in a humid chamber at 4oC. Sections were washed in PBS (5 minutes) and Vector ImmPress secondary 
was added for 1 hour at RT. Antibodies were visualized with Vector horseradish peroxidase (HRP) 
NovaRED for 10 minutes before washing in PBS (5 minutes) to stop the reaction. Sections were then 
blocked with 2.5% NHS (20 minutes) before the second primary antibody, diluted in antibody diluent, 
was added (overnight in humid chamber, 4oC). Sections were washed in PBS (5 minutes) and Vector 
ImmPress secondary was added for 1 hour at RT. Sections were visualized with Vector alkaline 
phosphatase (AP) Blue for 30 minutes, before washing in PBS (5 minutes) to stop the reaction. Sections 
were then rinsed in distilled water before mounting with Fluoromount. 
 
Fluorescent IHC on ex vivo brain slices. Slices were fixed in 4% PFA for 1 hour before being rinsed in 
PBS. The outer plastic ring of the cell culture insert was then removed and the slices were further washed 
in PBS (3x 10 minutes). Slices were incubated with blocking solution [3% HIHS, 2% bovine serum 
albumin (BSA; Sigma-Aldrich), 0.5% triton in PBS] for 2 hours at RT on a rocker. Primary antibodies, 
 diluted in blocking solution, were added either overnight at RT on a rocker, or for 2 nights at 4oC on a 
rocker (conditioned media experiments only). Slices were washed in blocking solution (10 minutes, then 
3x 1 hour) before the secondary antibodies were added overnight at RT on a rocker. Slices were washed 
with PBS (10 minutes, then 3x 1 hour) then Hoechst was added (1 minute). Slices were rinsed in PBS and 
mounted with Fluoromount. 
 
Immunocytochemistry (ICC). Cells were fixed in 4% PFA (10 minutes) then washed with PBS (3x 5 
minutes). Blocking solution (10% HIHS, 0.1% triton in PBS) was added for 1-1.5 hour at RT on a rocker. 
Cells were then incubated with primary antibodies, diluted in blocking solution, for 1-1.5 hour at RT on 
a rocker. Cells were washed with PBS (3x 2 minutes) then incubated with secondary antibodies, diluted 
in blocking solution, for 1 hour at RT on a rocker. Cells were washed with PBS (3x 2 minutes), Hoechst 
added (1 minute) and washed again with PBS (rinse then 2 minutes) before being mounted with 
Fluoromount.

Analysis of proteins  
Extraction of protein from tissue. Areas of basal ganglia from fresh, frozen sections of brain tissue, cut 
using a cryostat onto glass slides, were scraped off with a razor into a solution of 400 μl of 
radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer (Pierce) with 1% protease inhibitor (PI; Calbiochem), 
 aiming for a total of approximately 10 mg (10 μl by volume size) of tissue. This was homogenized by 
hand on ice with a plastic pestle before being sonicated (3x 10 seconds sonication followed by 10 seconds 
on ice). This was spun down in a microfuge (20 minutes, 13,000 RPM, 4oC) and the supernatant 
transferred to fresh tubes in 50 μl aliquots. 
 
Extraction of protein from cells. Culture media was removed from wells and approximately 50 μl of RIPA 
buffer with 1% PI was added to each well (of a 24 well plate). Cells were scraped with a bent pipette tip 
and the resultant liquid transferred to a tube. This was spun down in a microfuge (10 minutes, 13,000 
RPM, 4oC) and the supernatant collected. 
 
Quantification of total protein. Protein levels were quantified using a bicinchoninic acid assay (BCA 
assay), using solutions from a Pierce BCA protein assay kit. BCA working solution was prepared as 
specified, and 200 μl added to each well of a flat-bottomed 96-well plate. 10 μl of sample was added to 
each relevant well, and 9 wells were used for a BSA standard curve (0 μg/ml to 2000 μg/ml in RIPA). 
The plate was incubated at 37oC for 30 minutes and then allowed to cool to RT. The absorbance of each 
well at 562 nm was measured using an Omega Plate Reader. Protein concentration of each sample was 
then calculated by comparison to the standard curve. 
 
Western blotting. Protein lysates were diluted in RIPA and 4x Laemmli buffer [8% sodium dodecyl 
sulphate (SDS), 40% glycerol, 20% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.4% bromophenol blue, 0.25M Trizma 
hydrochloride; all from Sigma-Aldrich] to a concentration of 5 μg of protein in 20 μl (20 μg of protein in 
30 μl for ATP11B) in 1x Laemmli buffer. Samples were then boiled at 95oC for 5 minutes and loaded 
into Pierce ready-cast 4-20% Tris-HEPES gels, in a gel tank filled with HEPES running buffer (Pierce) 
or Bio-Rad 4-15% Mini-PROTEAN TGX Precast Protein Gels, (Bio-Rad) in gel tank filled with 10X 
TGS running buffer (Bio-Rad). Samples were run, along with a protein ladder (Bio-Rad) for 1.5 hours at 
100 Volts. The gel was then removed and placed into a transfer cassette with a polyvinylidene fluoride 
(PVDF) membrane [Merck Millipore; activated in methanol (Fisher)]. Gels were transferred in transfer 
buffer [20 mM Trizma base (Sigma-Aldrich), 150 mM glycine (Sigma-Aldrich), or 20% methanol in 
 water or 5% NuPage transfer buffer, 10% methanol in distilled water] for 2 hours at 400 mAmps or 1.5 
hours at 160mAmps on ice. The membrane was removed from the cassette, washed in TBST [tris buffered 
saline (TBS; 20 mM Trizma base, 150 mM sodium chloride (Sigma-Aldrich), 2.7 mM potassium chloride 
(Fisher) in water) + 0.1% tween; PBST (PBS + 0.05% tween) for ATP11B] and blocked with 4% BSA 
in TBST (5% milk in PBST for ATP11B) for 1 hour at RT on a rocker. The membrane was then incubated 
with primary antibodies diluted in block overnight at 4oC on a rocker. The membrane was washed with 
TBST (3x 10 minutes; PBST for ATP11B) then incubated with secondary antibodies in block (half as 
diluted for ATP11B) for 1 hour (2 hours for ATP11B) at RT on a rocker. The membrane was then washed 
with TBST (PBST for ATP11B) and ECL substrate (Thermo Fisher; femto kit for ATP11B) was put on 
the membrane for 5 minutes. The excess was dabbed off and the membrane was either exposed to a film 
that was then developed, or imaged using a LiCor scanner. 
 
Primary antibodies for western blot. ATP11B (1:250; Abcam; ab82640), claudin-5 (1:1,000; Zymed; 34-
1600), eNOS (1:1,000; Abcam; ab5589), GAPDH (1:1,000; Merck Millipore; MAB374), HSP90α 
(1:1,000; Abcam; ab59459), HSP90α (1:1,000; Enzo Life Sciences; ADI-SPS-771-D). 
 
ELISA for HSP90a 
HSP90AA1 ELISA Kit (Aviva Systems Biology) was used according to the manufacturers’ instructions. 
Briefly, 100 μl/well standards, samples and blanks were added to the microplate and incubated at 37oC 
for 2 hours. The liquid was discarded and 100 μl/well HSPAA1 detector antibody added for incubation 
at 37oC for 1 hour. After washing, 100 μl/well Avidin-HRP Conjugate was added and incubated at 37oC 
for 1 hour. After washing, 90 μl/well TMB substrate was added, followed by 50 μl/well stop solution 
after 30 minutes. O.D. absorbance was read at 450 nm with a standard microplate reader. 
 
 
Antibody array 
The antibody array was using a kit from Full Moon BioSystems (SET100) and was carried out as specified 
in their protocol. 
  
Molecular biology 
Extraction of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). Tail clips or ear punches from SHRSP and WKY rats were 
incubated in lysis buffer (1M Trizma hydrochloride), 0.5 M EDTA (Sigma-Aldrich), 5M sodium chloride, 
10% SDS in water) with 10% proteinase K (Promega) overnight at 55°C. The samples were then 
incubated at 95°C for 10 minutes, followed by an incubation at 0oC for 15 minutes. The samples were 
centrifuged for 10 minutes and the supernatant collected. This supernatant was diluted 1:10 for 
polymerase chain reaction. 
 
Extraction of ribonucleic acid (RNA). RNA was extracted from BMECs using the Qiagen RNeasy mini 
kit exactly as specified in the kit’s protocol. RNA samples were kept in water at -80°C until synthesis of 
complement DNA (cDNA). 
Synthesis of complement DNA (cDNA). All reagents came as part of SuperScript First-Strand Synthesis 
System for RT-PCR. 3-8 μl of RNA was mixed with 1 μl deoxynucleotides (dNTPs) and 1 μl hexamer 
primers (filled up with water to a total volume of 10 μl) and incubated for 5 minutes at 65°C. After cooling 
down for 1 minute on ice, an additional reaction mix was added (2 μl RT buffer, 4 μl MgCl2, 2 μl DTT, 
1 μl RNase OUT) and incubated for 2 minutes at RT. Then, 1 μl Superscript II was added and the samples 
were incubated for 10 minutes at. Subsequently, samples were incubated at 42°C (50 min) and 70°C (15 
min). cDNA synthesis was completed by adding 1 μl RNAse H and incubating at 37°C for 20 minutes. 
 
Polymerase chain reaction (PCR). PCR was carried out using Promega GoTaq Hot Start Polymerase, 
which included all the reagents required. To the master mix (10 μl 5X PCR buffer, 4 μl 25mM MgCl2, 1 
μl dNTPs, 5μl each of forward and reverse primers (1:10), 0.25 μl GoTaq in 22.75 μl water per reaction) 
2 μl of DNA sample was added. After activation of GoTaq polymerase, 30 cycles of amplification were 
carried out, followed by denaturation by a 2 minute incubation at 94 °C. A touch-down protocol was used 
for the annealing phase (60-48 °C). For the elongation stage, samples were held at 72 °C for 5 minutes. 
After the PCR was complete, samples were mixed with dye and visualized on a 1.3% agarose gel to 
 confirm that the reaction worked. PCR products for sequencing were purified using QIAquick PCR 
purification kit following the provided protocol. 
 
Sequencing of DNA/complement DNA (cDNA). Primers were designed, using NCBI primer blast, 300-
500 
bases 
either 
side 
of 
the 
predicted 
mutation 
site 
(Atp11b: 
forward: 
AAAGGCTACCTACTTGGTTGGG, reverse: CAATACTCTCTTCCGCCCACAG; Atp11b cDNA: 
forward: CCGCAGAAGGAAATGACCCT, reverse: CTCCTGGCAAGCTGTCTCAA) and the relevant 
region of (c)DNA was amplified using these primers by PCR. These products were 600-1,000 bases long 
as any sequencing reads in the first 100 bases or after 800 bases can sometimes be unreliable. These PCR 
products were sent off, along with forward and reverse primers around the predicted mutation site, to 
Source Bioscience for sequencing, according to their specifications (16 pmol in 5 μl of primers per 
reaction, 50 ng in 5 μl of each sample per reaction). Sequences were aligned using BioEdit Sequence 
Alignment Editor (Ibis Biosciences). 
 
Assay of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) activity 
NOS activity was measured using an assay kit from Merck Millipore which reduced all nitrates in 
conditioned media to nitrites, and quantified this based on a color change when Griess reagents were 
added.  
 
Imaging and analysis 
Imaging. Fluorescent images were captured using Leica SPE and Leica SP8 confocal microscope systems. 
Colorimetric images were captured using an AxioScan Slide Scanner. 
Image analysis. All immunostained images were quantified using the FIJI build of ImageJ software (open 
source). Cells were counted using the Cell Counter plugin. ICC and drug study IHC images were blinded 
before quantification. Other IHC images were not blinded prior to quantification, however a random 
selection was quantified again after blinding to confirm the reliability of the quantification. On brain 
sections, at least five fields of view from the deep white matter and basal ganglia were analyzed per 
 subject. For in vitro experiments at least three fields of view from each of a minimum of two wells were 
analyzed per biological repeat. 
 
Quantification of western blots. Western blots were analyzed using the Western Blot Quantification tool 
in FIJI, or Image Studio Lite (LI-COR Biosciences), to give the relative intensity of different bands. These 
were then normalized to the sample loading control.

Fig. S6. More HSP90α is secreted by BMECs isolated from DM rats. Graph showing the 
results from the Full Moon Signalling Explorer antibody array. Each point represents a different 
protein detected by the array. The y-axis shows the mean fluorescence of the spots for that protein 
on the array of the DM conditioned media (CM). The x-axis shows the log2 of the fold change 
between the DM CM and control CM (brightness of spot in DM CM divided by brightness of 
spot in control CM). Points further to the right represent proteins which are higher in DM CM, 
whereas those on the left represent proteins which are lower in DM CM compared to controls. 
Spots with a mean fluorescence below 400 are unreliable (too close to the negative control) and 
those with log2 [fold change] less than 0.5 do not show large differences between DM and control 
CM. These proteins are represented in grey, whereas potential proteins of interest are shown in 
blue and green. HSP90α, indicated in green, was chosen as the first candidate to investigate.

Fig. S10. SNPs within ATP11B are associated with WMH in the Cohorts for Heart and 
Aging Research in Genomic Epidemiology (CHARGE). Chart showing the location of SNPs 
investigated within ATP11B, with different introns indicated by alternating light and dark 
bands. The y-axis shows the –log10 (P) of the association of that SNP with WMH burden on 
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), a marker of SVD. Data is from the CHARGE consortium 
and includes 17,936 individuals of European descent from 29 population-based cohorts (40). 
SNPs in grey are those with P>0.05, while those in blue and red are those with P<0.05. After 
correcting for multiple testing, using spectral decomposition to determine the number of 
independent SNPs tested using the 1000 Genomes reference as a measure of linkage 
disequilibrium (41) (modified significance value of P<0.00058), we found one SNP which was 
associated with WMH burden: rs148771930, indicated in red. 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Fig. S11. Summary of findings, illustrating the central role of endothelial dysfunction in 
small vessel disease (SVD) pathology. Endothelial dysfunction manifests as reduced production 
of nitric oxide, endothelial cell (EC) proliferation, reduced tight junctions (TJs) and a weakened 
blood brain barrier (BBB). This BBB leakage may contribute to later progressive perivascular 
and white matter injury. Dysfunctional ECs secrete HSP90α, which inhibits oligodendrocyte 
precursor cell (OPC) maturation, increasing vulnerability to white matter lesions. Other as yet 
unidentified endothelial secreted factors stimulate OPC proliferation. Drugs, such as simvastatin, 
perindopril and cilostazol, can improve this endothelial dysfunction, restoring normal OPC 
maturation, OPC proliferation, and TJs. We show a genetic upstream cause of this endothelial 
dysfunction, a loss of ATP11B, however endothelial dysfunction may also occur through other 
genetic causes and/or environmental influences (smoking, hypertension, diabetes mellitus).
