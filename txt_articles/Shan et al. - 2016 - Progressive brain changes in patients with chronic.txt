Purpose: To examine progressive brain changes associated with chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS).
Materials and Methods: We investigated progressive brain changes with longitudinal MRI in 15 CFS and 10 normal
controls (NCs) scanned twice 6 years apart on the same 1.5 Tesla (T) scanner. MR images yielded gray matter (GM) vol-
umes, white matter (WM) volumes, and T1- and T2-weighted signal intensities (T1w and T2w). Each participant was
characterized with Bell disability scores, and somatic and neurological symptom scores. We tested for differences in lon-
gitudinal changes between CFS and NC groups, inter group differences between pooled CFS and pooled NC popula-
tions, and correlations between MRI and symptom scores using voxel based morphometry. The analysis methodologies
were first optimized using simulated atrophy.
Results: We found a significant decrease in WM volumes in the left inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus (IFOF) in CFS while in
NCs it was unchanged (family wise error adjusted cluster level P value, PFWE < 0.05). This longitudinal finding was consoli-
dated by the group comparisons which detected significantly decreased regional WM volumes in adjacent regions (PFWE <
0.05) and decreased GM and blood volumes in contralateral regions (PFWE < 0.05). Moreover, the regional GM and WM
volumes and T2w in those areas showed significant correlations with CFS symptom scores (PFWE < 0.05).
Conclusion: The results suggested that CFS is associated with IFOF WM deficits which continue to deteriorate at an
abnormal rate.

hronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), sometimes referred to
as myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME), is a debilitating ill-
ness with a variety of presenting features. Although prolonged
and disabling fatigue is present in 10–25% of patients present-
ing to general practitioners,1 a diagnosis of CFS requires that
patients experience persistent or relapsing fatigue for at least 6
consecutive months and have four or more of the following
symptoms: postexertional malaise, impaired memory or concen-
tration, unrefreshing sleep, muscle pain, multi-joint pain with-
out redness or swelling, tender cervical or axillary lymph nodes,
sore throat, and headache.2,3 Although the cause of CFS remains
unknown, altered central nervous system (CNS) function is
believed to play an important role,4 including altered perception
of fatigue and pain, deficits in the cognitive functions of concen-
tration and memory, mood changes of depression and anxiety,
and sleep disturbance.1 Accordingly, neuroimaging studies have
investigated possible brain changes associated with CFS.5–8
However, most of the previous neuroimaging studies were cross
sectional comparisons of differences between CFS patients and
normal controls (NCs) except one longitudinal study that exam-
ined white matter (WM) hyperintensities, cerebral blood and
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flows in scans 1 year apart.9

 Longitudinal brain change associated with CFS is of
importance in both understanding the pathomechanism and
development of CFS and in the evaluation of interventions.
One intervention study reported increased gray matter
(GM) volume in the lateral frontal lobe in CFS patients
who underwent cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) 10
months after baseline.10 The authors interpreted this change
to be a result of CBT. However, this interpretation is prob-
lematic without a knowledge of longitudinal brain changes
in the CFS patients without intervention, because the
reported changes could also be due to brain plasticity associ-
ated with CFS or progression of CFS, instead of the inter-
vention. Continuing brain changes associated with CFS
have yet to be investigated. The purpose of this longitudinal
study is to evaluate progressive brain changes associated
with CFS.
Previous cross-sectional neuroimaging studies of CFS
have yielded inconsistent results. One group found significant
reductions in global GM volumes6 while others did not.8,11
One study found a decrease in regional GM volume in pre-
frontal areas,7 and another found such decreases in the occipi-
tal lobe, right angular gyrus, and left parahippocampal
gyrus.12 Cortical thickness was found to be increased in right
arcuate fasciculus end points, the middle temporal gyrus, pre-
central gyri, and occipital lobe,8 while other studies did not
find significant regional GM differences.6,11 Similarly, incon-
sistent WM changes have been reported.8,11–13 Such inconsis-
tency could be due to sample size, proportion of genders,
diagnosis criteria, duration of the disease or even the heteroge-
neous nature of CFS. However, it could be also due to the
empirical parameters used in quantitative image processing.
In response to the aforementioned challenges, we
designed a longitudinal MRI study to investigate long term
brain changes associated with CFS over 6 years using opti-
mized voxel based morphometry (VBM) analysis. The pur-
pose of this study is to (1) optimize VBM methodology for
analysis of longitudinal images using simulated atrophy, (2)
investigate longitudinal brain changes in patients with CFS,
(3) detect brain structural differences between CFS and
NCs, and (4) identify correlations in CFS between struc-
tural differences and disease severity measures.
Materials and Methods
Subjects
The subjects were recruited based on availability, from 25 subjects
with CFS and 25 NCs from a previous cross-sectional study.14 The
initial recruitment of the CFS group was from community-based
specialist and general practice. They met both the Fukuda3 and
Canadian2 criteria. Their assessment was detailed in a previous
report.11 After approximately 6 years, 15 of the subjects with CFS,
aged 34.06 6 8.77 (mean 6 SD) at first evaluation, and 10 NC
subjects, aged 30.5 6 7.93 at first evaluation, could be contacted
and agreed to participate in a repeat longitudinal evaluation. The
time intervals between the two evaluations for CFS and NCs were
6.43 6 0.57 and 6.21 6 0.31 years, respectively. No CFS or NC
subject had developed a significant medical, including hyperten-
sion, or psychiatric illness in the intervening years. One CFS and
one NC subject had remained on thyroxine to treat hypothyroid-
ism, which predated their involvement in the initial study. Three
CFS subjects were taking antidepressants and were requested to
stop these for 1 week before their MRI scans. No subject was oth-
erwise taking centrally acting medication. In both CFS and NC
subjects, there was no significance change in weight across time.
There were four CFS males (male to female ratio 5 0.36) and two
NC males (male to female ratio 5 0.25). There was no significant
difference in age (P 5 0.20) or time interval (P 5 0.27) between
the CFS and NC groups. All subjects were right-handed, not
smokers, nor substance abusers.
CFS severity was measured by three scores: the Bell CFS dis-
ability score,15 a somatic symptom score (Somatic SS), and a neu-
rological symptom score (Neuro SS).14 The Somatic and Neuro SS
were derived from self-scores of the 10 most significant symp-
toms.16 The Somatic SS was the sum of the six self-scores for
severity of fatigue, change in sleeping patterns, dizziness on stand-
ing, pain in muscles, stomach symptoms, and overall level of func-
tion. The Neuro SS was the sum of four self-scores for change in
concentration, change in short-term memory, headaches, and expe-
rience of emotional swings. All three symptom scores are inversely
proportional to the severity of the disease, i.e., lower scores indicate
more severe disease. To determine their levels of depression and
anxiety, all subjects completed the Hospital Anxiety and Depres-
sion Scale (HADS) questionnaire.17 The HADS questionnaire was
used in this study because it has been proved to be a reliable and
simple test and patients have no difficulty in understanding the
reason to answer the questionnaire.
The study protocol was approved by the Human Research
Ethics Committee of The Queen Elizabeth Hospital in compliance
with the Australia National Statement on Ethical Conduct in
Human Research, and all subjects gave informed written consent
for both examinations.
MRI Acquisition
MR images at both time points were acquired on a Philips 1.5
Tesla (T) Intera MR scanner (Philips, Eindhoven, the Netherlands)
with a body transmit coil and birdcage receive coil. Transverse ana-
tomic images were acquired using a three-dimensional spoiled
gradient-echo sequence with TR 5 5.76 ms, TE 5 1.9 ms, flip
angle 5 98, resolution 5 0.938 3 0.938 3 1 mm3. Transverse T1
weighted spin echo MR images with contiguous slices of 0.82 3
0.82 3 3 mm3 were acquired with TR 5 600 ms, TE 5 15 ms,
flip angle 5 908. Transverse T2 weighted spin echo MR images
with contiguous slices of 0.82 3 0.82 3 3 mm3 were acquired
with TR 5 4000 ms, TE 5 80 ms, flip angle 5 908.
Segmentation and Validation
The three-dimensional anatomic images were segmented into GM,
WM, CSF, and extra-cerebral tissue using SPM12 (Wellcome Trust
Centre for Neuroimaging, London, UK), in which a unified proba-
bilistic framework that combined image segmentation, tissue classi-
fication, and bias correction within the same generative model was

Volume 44, No. 5
 implemented.18 In SPM12, the unified segmentation incorporates
a few iterations of a simple Markov Random Field (MRF) cleanup
procedure to remove isolated voxel assignments. Optimization of
the user-specified parameter that controls the strength of the MRF
is described in the Supplementary Material, which is available
online. As a result anatomical images from CFS and NC were seg-
mented with the MRF value of 4. Global GM and WM volumes
were computed in SPM12 by summing all voxel values in the GM
and WM images accounting for the voxel volumes.
Statistical Analysis of Longitudinal Changes in
Clinical Measures and Global Volumes
Longitudinal changes in each group and inter-group differences in
the clinical measures (Bell CFS disability score, Somatic SS, Neuro
SS, anxiety and depression from HADS) and global GM and WM
volumes were tested using SPSS22 (IBM, New York).
Paired two tailed t-tests were used to test for equality of
means and to compare longitudinal changes in the clinical meas-
ures, global GM volumes, and global WM volumes in both the
CFS and NC groups. Correlation coefficients between time point
1 and time point 2 values for the clinical measures, global GM
volumes, and global WM volumes, were tested for a significant dif-
ference from zero. Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons
of the seven characteristics (five symptom measures and two brain
volumes) was used to determine uncorrected (P < 0.05) and cor-
rected (P < 0.0071) statistical significance.
The clinical measures and global GM and WM volumes of
the CFS and NC groups pooled over the two times were compared
using an independent two group t-test. Two-tailed tests for equality
of means with unequal group variances were followed by Bonfer-
roni correction for multiple comparisons of eight characteristics
(five symptom measures, one age, and two brain volumes) to deter-
mine uncorrected (P < 0.05) and corrected (P < 0.0062). Pearson
correlations between each clinical measure and global GM and
WM volumes from all subjects were calculated. Bivariate tests of
significant difference in correlation coefficient from zero with two
tails were followed with Bonferroni correction for multiple com-
parisons of 21 pairs to test for uncorrected (P < 0.05) and cor-
rected (P < 0.0023) statistical significance.
Assessment of VBM Options Using Simulated
Atrophy
VBM derives images of relative GM and WM volumes from struc-
tural MR images, which can then be subjected to voxel-wise statis-
tical analysis in cross-sectional or longitudinal studies. VBM is a
well-established tool to examine patterns of regional brain changes
in neurological diseases and neuroanatomical correlates of CNS
diseases. Although much VBM preprocessing and analysis is auto-
mated in SPM, many methodological options remain for user
selection,19 including selection or creation of templates, registration
algorithms, and comparison strategies.
To optimize and test the VBM methodology options, we
used an atrophy simulation tool with a topology preserving trans-
formation model.20 MR images from 25 normal controls were
used for the simulation study. Tool inputs were the original image,
its segmentation, location of the atrophy center, and the radius of
the atrophy sphere. The tool simulates atrophy by finding a dense
warping deformation that produces the specified levels of volumet-
ric loss on the labelled tissue using an energy minimization strat-
egy. The topology of tissue morphology is preserved in the
simulation (Fig. 1). We selected the atrophy center on the axial
slice at the level of the inferior colliculus and, within that slice, in
WM at the anterior pole of the left cerebral peduncle. The center
was defined manually for each subject in native space. (Fig. 1
shows this location in two subjects each with two atrophy levels).
This region was chosen to mimic the atrophy reported in one of
our previous studies.11 Atrophy spheres (radius 5 5 mm) with
three levels of atrophy (5%, 3%, and 1%) were applied.
The original images and images with simulated atrophy rep-
resent images at time points 1 and 2 in a longitudinal study. Six
methodological options were considered. Smoothing was per-
formed with an 8 mm 3 8 mm 3 8 mm full-width half-maxi-
mum Gaussian filter for all options. All used processing modules
implemented in SPM12.
1. DARTEL DN directly normalizes individual images into MNI
(Montreal Neurological Institute) space (Supp. Fig. S1). (a) All
3D anatomic images were segmented into GM and WM parti-
tions using a unified segmentation framework18 with the opti-
mized
MRF
parameter.
(b)
For
each
individual,
the
deformation of their GM image to MNI space was computed
using DARTEL (diffeomorphic anatomical registration through
exponentiated lie algebra) nonlinear registration and recorded
as flow field image.21 This procedure was implemented in
SPM12 by means of “Run Dartel (existing template)”. (c) The
flow field images were then used to normalize GM and WM
images to MNI space and generate smoothed, spatially normal-
ized, and modulated images. The latter encode the local vol-
ume changes associated with the nonlinear deformation, by
means of Jacobian scaling, into image intensities. (d) Finally,
the preprocessed WM images at time point 1 were compared
with those from time point 2 using an SPM12 (parametric)
paired t-test.
2. DARTEL ST (study specific template) is the same as option 1
except that a study-specific GM template was created in (b)
(Supp. Fig. S1). This involves iteratively matching all images to
a template generated from their own means, It was imple-
mented by means of “Run Dartel (create template)” in
SPM12. The study-specific template is then normalized to
MNI space in step 1(c). Two deformations, the flow field
images representing individual image to study-specific template
and the transformations of the template to MNI space, were
combined and encoded in modulated images.
3. SHOOT ST is the same as option 2 except that the two imple-
mentations of DARTEL were replaced by a diffeomorphic
registration using geodesic shooting and Gauss-Newton optimi-
zation22 (Supp. Fig. S1).
4. DARTEL SnPM is the same as option 2 except that a nonpara-
metric paired t-test23 was used in step (d) (Supp. Fig. S1).
5. LD (longitudinal difference) first creates within-subject tem-
plates (Supp. Fig. S2). (a) Raw images from the 1st and 2nd
time points were aligned to MNI space using a rigid body
registration. (b) For each subject, these aligned images were
averaged to create the subject template. (c) Raw images from
Shan et al.: Progressive Brain Changes in CFS

 1st and 2nd time points were then aligned to this subject tem-
plate. (d) Aligned images from step (c) were preprocessed using
the same procedures as option 2. (e) Difference images were
calculated by subtracting the preprocessed image of time point
2 from that of time point 1. (f) Difference images from step
(e) were compared using a one sample parametric t-test.
6. LJD (longitudinal Jacobian difference) creates a within-subject
template differently to option 5 (Supp. Fig. S2). (a) A symmet-
ric diffeomorphic modelling of longitudinal data24 was used to
create a mid-point image by estimating the optimal mapping
between the template and each of the images by means of
“Pairwise Longitudinal Registration” in SPM12. A Jacobian
difference image records the difference of the Jacobian map for
deformation from the mid-point image to the first scan and
this to the second scan. (b) The mid-point (mean) image was
segmented into GM, WM and CSF images. (c) GM images
from step (b) were used to create a study-specific template
using DARTEL. (d) The Jacobian difference images from step
(a) were multiplied by the GM image from step (b). (e) The
difference images from step (d) were normalized to MNI space
and smoothed. (f) Difference images from step (e) were com-
pared using a one sample SPM12 (parametric) t-test.
The simulated atrophy images were analyzed using SPM12
with the above six VBM methodology options. To evaluate the
sensitivity of each option, different randomly selected sample sizes
(N 5 25, 20, 15, 10) for each level of atrophy were compared
with the original images from the same subjects with the six VBM
options. Statistical significance was determined using family wise
error (FWE) corrected voxel level P < 0.05. Significant clusters
with more than 25 voxels and less than 25 voxels that overlapped
the simulated atrophy were defined as true positive (TP) and small
true positive (STP), respectively. Significant clusters that were
found at different locations from the simulated atrophy were
defined as false positive (FP). Failure to detect simulated atrophy
was defined as false negative (FN) (Supp. Fig. S3).
VBM Preprocessing of Longitudinal MR Data From
CFS Patients and NCs
Anatomic MR images from CFS and NC were preprocessed using
the optimum VBM LD methodological option (5a-5e). Images of
T1 and T2 spin echo intensities were first co-registered to their
corresponding anatomic images. Second, co-registered T1w and
T2w images were normalized to the MNI atlas using the deforma-
tion from 5f above and smoothed. The global signal levels were
computed for each subject as the mean voxel value in a mask
(brain region) generated using the voxel-based iterative sensitivity
(VBIS) method.25
Image Comparison
Each image was first normalized either by the total GM volume,
WM volume, global T1w level, or global T2w level. To perform
VBM comparisons of longitudinal difference between CFS patients
and NCs, temporal difference images were divided by the corre-
sponding time between the two scan dates to generate rate-of-
change images. Rate-of-change images from CFS patients were
compared with those from NCs with a two sample t-test. The

relationship to the radius of the atrophy sphere or atrophy rate. All images are in their native space. a,e,c,g: Respectively, the

 significance of rate-of-change difference was tested using FWE cor-
rected cluster level P < 0.05.
To perform cross-sectional comparisons between groups of CFS
images and NC images pooled over the two time points, regional brain
differences were determined with a two sample t-test. The significance
of inter group difference was tested using FWE corrected cluster level
P < 0.05. In addition to group comparisons, SPM regressions were
performed against clinical measures of Bell CFS disability score,
Somatic SS, and Neuro SS). All analyses incorporated the covariates
of age, the appropriate global value (total GM volume, WM volume,
global T1w level, or global T2w level), and HADS depression and
anxiety scores. The significance of correlation was tested using family
wise error (FWE) corrected cluster level P < 0.05.
Results
Optimization of Segmentation and VBM Options
The SPM12 segmentation with MRF of 4 rendered GM
images that were closest to the manual segmentation results,
i.e., highest median and smallest interquartile range for the
Dice coefficient (Supp. Fig. S4). Table 1 summarizes the
performance of the six VBM options. For sample sizes less
than or equal to 15, the longitudinal approaches (LD and
LJD) have higher sensitivity in preventing FN than DAR-
TEL DN, DARTEL ST, and DARTEL SnPM. However,
the LJD option also generates many FP inferences. The LD
option was, therefore, optimal and was used here in VBM
analysis of CFS and NC images.
Comparison of Clinical Measures and
Global Volumes
For patients with CFS, mean longitudinal changes and correla-
tions between time 1 and time 2 values for clinical measures and
global GM and WM volumes are summarized in Table 2 (see
Supp. Table S1 for those in NCs). There are significant decreases
in total GM volume and increases in total WM volumes in both
the CFS and NC groups (Table 2 and Supp. Table S1), although
these longitudinal changes in total GM and WM volumes did
not differ significantly between CFS and NC groups.
Table 3 summarizes means of clinical measures and total
GM and WM volumes for pooled CFS and NC groups.
There is no significant difference in total GM and WM vol-
umes and ages between CFS and NC groups. All symptom
scores are significantly different between CFS and NC groups.
Bivariate correlations between any pair of clinical measures or
total GM and WM volumes are summarized in Table 4. Pairs
that are significantly correlated to each other are: total GM &
WM volumes, depression and anxiety, and Neuro SS and
somatic SS. In addition, total WM volumes were correlated
with Somatic SS with uncorrected P < 0.05.
Different Longitudinal MRI Changes Between
CFS and NC
The rate-of-change of regional WM volumes in CFS
patients was significantly different from that in NCs in the

Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space, encoding of deformations as volume changes, smoothing with Gaussian kernel of 8mm 3 8mm 38mm, and parametric comparison. For an
example, methodological option of DARTEL ST uses DARTEL registration to create a study specific template, normalizes final template MNI space, warps segmented images into MNI
space, modulates volumetrics into intensities, smooths, and compares parametrically. Supplementary Figures S1 and S2 illustrated details of each option.

 left posterior part of the inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus
(IFOF) and/or arcuate fasciculus (Fig. 2). In this location,
WM volume relative to global WM volume decreased with
time in the CFS group while in NCs it was unchanged.
Cross-sectional Differences in Pooled MR Images
The regional differences of GM and WM volumes and T1w
and T2w signal intensities between pooled CFS and NC
groups are summarized in Figure 3. In CFS, GM volumes
were significantly decreased in the right inferior temporal
gyrus and increased in the right supplementary motor area.
The CFS group showed a significant decrease in WM volume
in the left posterior part of IFOF/arcuate fasciculus. In the
CFS group T1w signal intensities were significantly higher on
the right in the parahippocampal gyrus, inferior temporal
gyrus, and IFOF/arcuate fasciculus. T2w signal intensities
were significantly higher in the right IFOF/arcuate fasciculus
and inferior frontal gyrus regions in the CFS group.
Correlations of Pooled MR Images With Symptom
Scores in CFS
Regional regression SPM results are summarized in Figure
4. Regional GM volume was significantly correlated with
Neuro SS in the right fusiform gyrus positively and left
superior parietal lobule negatively. Regional GM volume in
the culmen was significantly and positively correlated with
Somatic SS. Regional WM volume was significantly and
positively correlated with Somatic SS in WM regions infe-
rior to the left precentral sulcus. T2 signal intensities in left
and right anterior IFOF/arcuate fasciculus were significantly
and negatively correlated with Neuro SS.
Discussion
This study was designed to investigate longitudinal brain
changes in CFS patients. The strength of the study is that we
first validated SPM segmentation against manual segmentation
and optimized VBM methodology for longitudinal analysis.

 We found for the first time that, over a period of 6 years,
regional WM volume decreases in the left IFOF/arcuate fasci-
culus in CFS patients while remaining stable in NCs. This lon-
gitudinal WM finding was consolidated by cross-sectional
analysis of the pooled CFS and NC groups. Inter-group com-
parison found decreased GM and WM volumes and increased
T1w and increased T2w intensities (which may reflect
decreased blood volumes and ischemia) near this ILOF/arcuate

and T2w (blood volumes) were positively correlated with the
Neuro and Somatic Symptom Scores in the same areas and
elsewhere.
VBM is a commonly used automated tool for studying
patterns of brain change in neurological diseases and neuro-
anatomical correlates of subject characteristics. Although
most VBM processing and analysis is automated in SPM,
several methodological options remain for user specifica-
tion,19 especially in analysis of longitudinal image data.
Inconsistent VBM findings in CFS patients in previous
studies6,7,12,14 motivated us here to validate segmentation
and optimize VBM methodology. The VBM atrophy simu-
lation experiment demonstrated (1) that normalization to a

 study specific template performs better than direct normal-
ization to the default template provided in SPM12; (2)
when the sample size is small, a random effects one-sample
t-test of longitudinal difference images, either by means of
the Jacobian difference method or the direct difference
between different time points, has higher sensitivity than a
paired t-test of images from two time points; (3) that crea-
tion of a single image representative of the two time points
(within-subject template) for the purpose of the shared final
spatial normalization should involve similar normalizations
of both raw images and the same processing steps.
This study detected continuing shrinkage of WM in
the left IFOF in patients with CFS, but not in NCs. This
result was consolidated by the pooled inter group compari-
sons revealing decreased regional WM volumes in adjacent
regions and decreased GM and blood volumes in contralat-
eral regions and by regression analysis showing significant
correlations of WM and GM volumes and T2w intensities
with CFS symptom scores in those regions. The superficial
and dorsal subcomponent of the IFOF connects the frontal
lobe with the superior parietal lobe and the ventral subcom-
ponent of the IFOF connects the frontal lobe with the infe-
rior occipital lobe and temporo-basal area.26 Therefore, our
findings are consistent with the decreased intrinsic connec-
tivity in CFS within left fronto-parietal networks (FPN)
found in a resting-state functional connectivity study.27 Sim-
ilarly, a diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) study reported bilat-
eral
white
matter
atrophy
and
increased
fractional
anisotropy in the arcuate fasciculus, possibly reflecting
degeneration of cross fibers.8
The IFOF connects networks of cognitive control,
attention, language processing, and working memory28 and
links the bilateral insular regions and anterior cingulate cor-
tex.29 Considerable evidence suggested that the IFOF plays
a pivotal role as the connectivity substrate in goal-directed
cognition, mediating the dynamic balance between default
mode network and dorsal attention networks.30 Therefore,
symptoms experienced by CFS patients, such as impaired
concentration, working memory loss, inability to focus
vision, and poor motor coordination could be explained, in
part at least, by our finding of continuing shrinkage of WM
in the IFOF. Our finding of IFOF WM shrinkage in CFS,
together with consistent findings by us and others above,
warrants more investigations to understand the pathome-
chanism of this deficit.
Compared
with
NC,
CFS
patients
also
showed
decreased GM volume and increased T1w and T2w signal
intensities near the contralateral ILOF. The absence of corre-
sponding longitudinal findings in the right hemisphere may
be a result of lower sensitivity in longitudinal studies and/or
because the changes in CFS occurred soon after onset
(before the first scan) and did not progress appreciably
thereafter. The increased T2w signal intensities suggest
possible decreased blood volume in these regions.31 Indeed,
previous studies have found decreased regional cerebral
blood flow in frontal and temporal lobes32 and decreased
frontal oxygenation33 in patients with CFS. Thus, a gradual
and chronic hypoperfusion of the brain may contribute to
this continuing WM shrinkage.
Additionally, chronic functional hypoxia due to dys-
function of the neurovascular unit could also cause neurode-
generation.34 Of interest, a recent study found seventeen
single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were significantly
associated with CFS.35 Nine of these SNPs were associated
with muscarinic acetylcholine receptors and eight with nico-
tinic ACh receptors (nAChRs). ACh, a neuromodulator in
the brain, changes the state of neuronal networks through-
out the brain and modifies their response to internal and
external inputs. Control of synaptic Ca21 concentration fol-
lowing nAChR stimulation is a major pathway for ACh to
influence neuronal networks.36 Furthermore, nAChRs are
also present in the cerebral vascular endothelium and
smooth muscles.37 Thus, aberrant AChR function may
impair cerebrovascular autoregulation and cause chronic
functional hypoxia. Distribution of moderate nAChR den-
sity in temporal parietal cortices and low levels in white
matter tracts could make IFOF more vulnerable to aberrant
AChR function. Furthermore, the IFOF is in a brain region
that undergoes continued organization in early adulthood38
and is particularly vulnerable to vascular risk factors.39
Regression analysis also showed several image measures
correlated with symptom scores in regions other than the
IFOF. These findings are consistent with existing knowledge
of
brain
structure-function
relationships.
For
example,
regional GM volumes are positively correlated with Neuro
SS in the right fusiform gyrus, which is involved with brain
recognition functions. Similarly, low regional GM volumes
in the culmen of cerebellum and low regional WM volumes
inferior to precentral sulcus are correlated with impaired
somatic status.
The inter-group comparison and regression analysis
showed that CFS patients had increased regional GM vol-
ume in the supplementary motor area and this regional GM
volume is negatively correlated with Neuro SS, i.e., higher
regional GM volume with more severe symptoms. These
findings are in line with the clinical observation that CFS
patients need extra effort for motor coordination, with
fMRI results that CFS patients recruit more cerebral regions
for tasks,40 and with increased cortical thickness in CFS in
the precentral gyrus.8 We postulate that these increased
regional GM volumes may be a result of brain plasticity
compensating for communication deficits because of WM
shrinkage.
This study has several limitations. We found continu-
ing shrinkage of WM volume in posterior IFOF region in
CFS patients. Although several tracts could be affected in
Shan et al.: Progressive Brain Changes in CFS

 this area, we postulated that the IFOF was mainly involved
based on previous fMRI studies.27 Therefore, it is still nec-
essary to identify and confirm deficits in WM fiber tracts
using DTI. Indeed, we are currently acquiring DTI and
fMRI data to identify affected WM tracts and to investigate
functional consequences of these deficits. Two symptom
severity scores, Somatic and Neuro SS, used in this study
are based on the most frequent CFS symptoms16 and,
although not validated, have much in common with vali-
dated scores, such as the Center for Disease Control CFS
symptom inventory. The study was designed to investigate
progressive brain changes with an interval between the two
scans of 6 years. The first scan included 25 CFS patients
and 25 NCs, but because of the relatively long interval,
only 15 CFS patients and 10 NCs returned for the second
scan. Although we detected progressive WM atrophy in the
IFOF region in CFS patients, because of our small sample
size and low detection power, we cannot rule out progressive
changes elsewhere that are specific to CFS.
In conclusion, we optimized VBM for longitudinal
analysis and for the first time found continuing WM
shrinkage in the left posterior IFOF in CFS patients but not
NCs, using MR data acquired with a 6-year gap. The longi-
tudinal finding was consolidated by the decreased regional
GM, WM, and blood volumes in adjacent regions. Further-
more, these regional GM and WM volumes were signifi-
cantly correlated with symptom scores. The results suggest
that CFS is a chronic illness with abnormal connections
among brain regions and WM deficits which continue to
deteriorate post onset. This study warrants further investiga-
tions to understand the pathomechanism of WM deficits in
the IFOF in CFS.
