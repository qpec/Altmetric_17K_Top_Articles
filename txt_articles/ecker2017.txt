IMPORTANCE Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is 2 to 5 times more common in male
individuals than in female individuals. While the male preponderant prevalence of ASD might
partially be explained by sex differences in clinical symptoms, etiological models suggest that
the biological male phenotype carries a higher intrinsic risk for ASD than the female
phenotype. To our knowledge, this hypothesis has never been tested directly, and the
neurobiological mechanisms that modulate ASD risk in male individuals and female
individuals remain elusive.
OBJECTIVES To examine the probability of ASD as a function of normative sex-related
phenotypic diversity in brain structure and to identify the patterns of sex-related
neuroanatomical variability associated with low or high probability of ASD.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This study examined a cross-sectional sample of 98
right-handed, high-functioning adults with ASD and 98 matched neurotypical control
individuals aged 18 to 42 years. A multivariate probabilistic classification approach was used
to develop a predictive model of biological sex based on cortical thickness measures assessed
via magnetic resonance imaging in neurotypical controls. This normative model was
subsequently applied to individuals with ASD. The study dates were June 2005 to October
2009, and this analysis was conducted between June 2015 and July 2016.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Sample and population ASD probability estimates as a
function of normative sex-related diversity in brain structure, as well as neuroanatomical
patterns associated with low or high ASD probability in male individuals and female individuals.
RESULTS Among the 98 individuals with ASD, 49 were male and 49 female, with a mean (SD)
age of 26.88 (7.18) years. Among the 98 controls, 51 were male and 47 female, with a mean
(SD) age of 27.39 (6.44) years. The sample probability of ASD increased significantly with
predictive probabilities for the male neuroanatomical brain phenotype. For example,
biological female individuals with a more male-typic pattern of brain anatomy were
significantly (ie, 3 times) more likely to have ASD than biological female individuals with a
characteristically female brain phenotype (P = .72 vs .24, respectively; χ2
1 = 20.26; P < .001;
difference in P values, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.29-0.68). This finding translates to an estimated
variability in population prevalence from 0.2% to 1.3%, respectively. Moreover, the patterns
of neuroanatomical variability carrying low or high ASD probability were sex specific (eg, in
inferior temporal regions, where ASD has different neurobiological underpinnings in male
individuals and female individuals).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE These findings highlight the need for considering normative
sex-related phenotypic diversity when determining an individual’
s risk for ASD and provide
important novel insights into the neurobiological mechanisms mediating sex differences in
ASD prevalence.

A
utism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a complex neurode-
velopmental condition that is 2 to 5 times more com-
mon in male individuals than in female individuals.1,2
While the male preponderant prevalence of ASD might par-
tially be explained by sex differences in clinical symptoms,3,4
etiological models suggest that the biological male pheno-
type itself (ie, in general) carries a higher risk for ASD than the
female phenotype.5 However, despite the growing number of
studiesexaminingsexdifferencesinthebraininASD(eg,those
by Lai et al6 and by Schaer et al7), this hypothesis has never
been tested directly, to our knowledge, and the neurobiologi-
cal mechanisms that underpin the male preponderant preva-
lence of ASD remain elusive.8
This study examined the probability of ASD as a function
of normative sex-related phenotypic diversity in brain struc-
ture. To do so, we initially developed a predictive model of bio-
logical sex based on multivariate differences in brain struc-
ture in a sample of typically developing (TD) male and female
control individuals. This normative model was subsequently
applied to male individuals and female individuals with ASD.
Unlike recent studies examining sexual dimorphism of the
brain (reviewed by Ruigrok et al9), we used a probabilistic pat-
tern classification approach,10 which allowed us to accommo-
dateinterindividualphenotypicdiversitywithinandacrossthe
binary categories dictated by biological sex.11 As a result, we
were able (1) to examine the probability of ASD along a nor-
mative phenotypic axis ranging from the characteristic fe-
male to male brain phenotype and (2) to identify the patterns
of sex-related neuroanatomical variability associated with low
or high probability of ASD.
We based our analysis on measures of cortical thickness
(CT)becausethesemeasurementshavepreviouslybeenshown
to be highly variable between neurotypical male individuals
and female individuals12,13 and tend to be significantly al-
tered in individuals with ASD (eg, as shown by Ecker et al14 and
by Wallace et al15). Moreover, measures of CT are less sensi-
tive to global confounders associated with biological sex (eg,
differences in total brain volume) than other morphometric
features (eg, surface area).16-19 Last, we investigated whether
the cortical underpinnings of ASD are significantly modu-
lated by biological sex and whether ASD has common or dis-
tinct neuroanatomical underpinnings in male individuals and
female individuals.
Methods
Participants
Ninety-eight right-handed adults with ASD (49 male and 49 fe-
male; mean [SD] age, 26.88 [7.18] years) and 98 matched neu-
rotypical controls (51 male and 47 female; mean [SD] age, 27.39
[6.44] years) aged 18 to 42 years were recruited locally by ad-
vertisement and assessed at the Institute of Psychiatry, Psy-
chology and Neuroscience (IoPPN), London, England, and the
AutismResearchCentre,Cambridge,England(Table).Approxi-
mately equal ratios of cases to controls and male individuals to
female individuals were recruited within sites (eTable 1 in the
Supplement).Exclusioncriteriaincludedahistoryofmajorpsy-
chiatricdisorder(eg,psychosis),headinjury,ASD-associatedge-
netic disorders (eg, fragile X syndrome and tuberous sclero-
sis),oranyothermedicalconditionaffectingbrainfunction(eg,
epilepsy). We also excluded individuals taking antipsychotic
medication, mood stabilizers, or benzodiazepines.
All participants with ASD were diagnosed according to the
International Statistical Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revi-
sion research criteria. The clinical diagnosis was confirmed
using the Autism Diagnostic Interview–Revised (ADI-R)20 or
the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS).21 All par-
ticipants diagnosed with the ADI-R reached algorithm cut-
offs in the 3 domains of (1) communication (cutoff of 8), (2) re-
ciprocal social interaction (cutoff of 10), and (3) repetitive
behaviors and stereotyped patterns of interest (cutoff of 3), al-
though failure to reach the cutoff in the repetitive domain by
maximally 2 points was permitted. Because reliable infor-
mants were unavailable, we were unable to obtain ADI-R di-
agnostic data from 5 female individuals with ASD and con-
firmed diagnostic status using ADOS cutoffs. In all other
participants, the ADOS scores were used to assess the sever-
ity of current symptoms. One female individual with ASD fell
short by 1 point on the ADI-R communication and repetitive
behavior domains but met ADOS criteria. All participants had
a full-scale IQ greater than 70 assessed using the Wechsler Ab-
breviated Scale of Intelligence.22 Participants gave informed
written consent in accord with ethics approval by the Na-
tionalResearchEthicsCommittee,Suffolk,England.Thestudy
dates were June 2005 to October 2009, and this analysis was
conducted between June 2015 and July 2016.
Magnetic Resonance Imaging Data Acquisition
Imaging took place at the IoPPN and the Addenbrooke’
s Hos-
pital, Cambridge, using a 3-T system (Signa; GE Medical Sys-
tems). A specialized acquisition protocol using quantitative,
T1-weighted mapping was used to ensure standardization of
structural magnetic resonance imaging scans across sites,23,24
which resulted in high-resolution structural T1-weighted
inversion recovery images, with 1 × 1 × 1–mm resolution, a
256 × 256 × 176–pixel matrix, repetition time of 1800 milli-
seconds, inversion time of 50 milliseconds, flip angle of 20°,
and field of view of 25 cm.
Key Points
Question Does the neuroanatomical male brain phenotype carry
a higher intrinsic risk for autism spectrum disorder than the female
neurophenotype, which could explain the male preponderant
prevalence of autism spectrum disorder?
Findings In this case-control study of 98 adults with autism
spectrum disorder and 98 matched neurotypical control
individuals, the neurobiological male phenotype was associated
with a higher risk for autism spectrum disorder than the female
phenotype across the binary categories dictated by biological sex.
Meaning In addition to genetic and environmental factors,
normative sex-related phenotypic diversity should be considered
when determining an individual’
s risk for autism spectrum
disorder.

Cortical Reconstruction Using FreeSurfer
A software program (FreeSurfer, version 5.3.0; http://surfer
.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu) was used to derive cortical surface
models for each T1-weighted image. These well-validated and
fully automated procedures have been extensively described
elsewhere.25-27 All surface models were visually inspected for
errors, and scans with visible reconstruction inaccuracies
were excluded from the statistical analysis (dropout <10%).
We based our analysis on measures of CT (ie, the closest dis-
tance from the gray matter (GM) or white matter boundary to
the GM or cerebrospinal fluid boundary at each cerebral
vertex).28 Cortical thickness maps were smoothed with a
15-mm surface-based gaussian kernel.
Gaussian Process Classification
Gaussian process classification (GPC)10,29 was used for the
probabilistic prediction of biological sex based on neuro-
anatomical variability in CT (details are available in the
eMethods in the Supplement). In brief, we initially devel-
oped a normative model of biological sex by predicting the
binary class labels yi ε {−1, +1} for female and male TD con-
trols, respectively, using CT measures estimated at approxi-
mately 320 000 vertices on the cortical surface (Gaussian
Processes for Machine Learning Matlab toolbox; http://www
.gaussianprocess.org/gpml/code/matlab/doc). In addition to
the overall model accuracy (ie, proportion of biological male
individuals or female individuals correctly classified as phe-
notypic male individuals or female individuals), GPC
returned a set of predictive class probabilities indicating the
probability of an individual belonging to the male or female
category. Class probabilities ranged from 0 to 1 for the char-
acteristic female to male brain phenotype, respectively, so
that a class probability of 0.5 represents a binary cutoff sepa-
rating both classes. Classifier performance was validated by
cross-validation and tested for statistical significance via
1000 permutations of class labels. The normative model was
subsequently applied to male individuals and female indi-
viduals with ASD.
A predictive mapping approach30 was used to identify
(1) the spatially distributed patterns of neuroanatomical vari-
ability in CT characteristics for the neurotypical female or
male brain phenotype and (2) the set of brain regions associ-
ated with low or high probability of ASD. Normative or risk
(ie, low or high probability) patterns were derived by quanti-
fying the extent to which the individual’
s neuroanatomy
interacts with the spatial representation of the decision func-
tion (ie, the weight vector w) separating neurotypical male
individuals from female individuals phenotypically (ie, the
product of w and CT). The high ASD probability pattern
included all male individuals (or female individuals) with a
male neuroanatomical phenotype (ie, class probability >0.5).
The low ASD probability pattern included all male individuals
(or female individuals) with a female neuroanatomical phe-
notype (ie, class probability <0.5). We also identified these
patterns across all individuals along the normative axis of
predictive class probabilities. At each vertex, the resulting
maps were summarized by the mean value across all indi-
viduals within examined groups.

Estimation of ASD Probability
To examine the probability of ASD as a function of normative
phenotypic variability in brain structure, we converted the
continuous axis of class probabilities into a set of discrete
bins (eg, from 0 to 1 in steps of 0.125). Within each bin, the
sample probability of ASD was determined as the ratio of
individuals with ASD relative to the total number of individu-
als per bin. Moreover, these data allowed us to estimate the
population prevalence of ASD given that an individual exhib-
its a male or female neuroanatomical phenotype in addition
to being biologically male or female (details are available in
the eMethods in the Supplement). In brief, using Bayes theo-
rem, we combined our sample prevalence estimates with
previously published population prevalence rates of ASD for
biological male individuals and female individuals (ie, 1:42
for male individuals and 1:189 for female individuals31). In
this way, we were able to estimate the population prevalence
of ASD (D = 1) given a male (or female) neuroanatomical brain
phenotype (M) for biological male individuals (or female
individuals) (S), that is P
ˆ (D = 1 | M, S). Confidence intervals
were determined using an exact binomial test implemented
inasoftwarepackage(RProjectforStatisticalComputing;https:
//www.r-project.org).
Vertexwise Between-Group Comparison of CT
Vertexwise statistical analysis of CT measures was conducted
using the R2014a Matlab toolbox (SurfStat; http://www.math
.mcgill.ca/keith/surfstat). For the comparison between male
and female controls, parameter estimates were obtained by
regression of a general linear model at each vertex i, with bio-
logical sex and center as categorical fixed-effects factors and
total GM volume as a continuous covariate. To examine
whether the neuroanatomy of ASD is significantly modu-
lated by biological sex, we also included a main effect of
diagnostic group and biological sex and a group × sex inter-
action as follows:
yi = β0 + β1 Group + β2 Sex + β3 (Group × Sex) + β4
GMtotal + β5 Center + εi,
where y refers to the variable that is predicted by the model
(ie, the CT at voxel i) and εi is the residual error. Effects were
estimated from the coefficients β1-3 normalized by the corre-
sponding standard error. Corrections for multiple compari-
sons were performed using a random field theory–based clus-
ter analysis for nonisotropic images at a cluster threshold of
2-tailed P < .05.32 We also confirmed our findings using a non-
parametric clustering approach (2-tailed P < .05) using 10 000
permutations of the original data.33
Results
Prediction of Biological Sex Based
on Normative Variability in CT
Overall, our CT-driven probabilistic classifier predicted bio-
logical sex at an accuracy of 71.4% under cross-validation in
neurotypical controls, which was significantly higher than
would be expected by chance (P < .001 obtained via permu-
tation testing). In total, 68.1% (32 of 47) of all biological fe-
male individuals were correctly allocated to the category of
phenotypic female individuals and 74.5% (38 of 51) of all bio-
logical male individuals to the category of phenotypic male in-
dividuals (Figure 1A, lower panel). Across individuals, class
probabilities ranged continuously from 0 to 1 for the charac-
teristicfemaletomalebrainphenotype,respectively(Figure1A,
upper panel). Moreover, the patterns of CT variability associ-
ated with the phenotypic shift of the brain from a female to
male presentation resembled the set of brain regions where fe-
male individuals significantly differed from male individuals
(eFigure 1 and eFigure 2 in the Supplement). Therefore, while
a perfect phenotypic differentiation between biological sexes
could not be achieved, we were able to separate male indi-
viduals from female individuals in most cases based on mul-
tivariate differences in brain structure.
Phenotypic Prediction of Biological Sex
for Individuals With ASD
When applying our normative predictive model of biological
sex to the independent sample of individuals with ASD, we
found that, in female individuals with ASD, predictive class
probabilities for the male neuroanatomical brain phenotype
were significantly increased relative to female controls
(t94 = 6.13, P < .001) (Figure 1B). Overall, 39 of 49 female in-
dividuals (79.6%) with ASD were allocated to the category of
phenotypicmaleindividuals,whichwassignificantlymorefre-
quent than expected based on the typical rate of misclassifi-
cation for female controls (79.6% [39 of 49] vs 31.9% [15 of 47],
respectively; χ2
1 = 20.26, P < .001). No such differences were
observed in male individuals with ASD, who were correctly al-
located to the male category in 81.6% (40 of 49) of all cases
and also did not differ significantly from male controls in pre-
dictive class probabilities (t98 = 1.35, 2-tailed P > .17). There-
fore, when representing individuals along a single axis of nor-
mative sex-related phenotypic diversity in brain structure,
female individuals with ASD displayed a CT pattern that re-
sembled more closely the neurotypical male rather than fe-
male neurophenotype. This phenotypic shift in female indi-
viduals is likely to influence the probability of ASD.
ASD Probability as a Function of Normative Sex-Related
Phenotypic Variability in Brain Structure
In female individuals with ASD, the sample probability of ASD
increased with increasing predictive probabilities for the male
neuroanatomical brain phenotype (eFigure 3A in the Supple-
ment). More specifically, female individuals with class prob-
abilities exceeding the binary sex cutoff of 0.5 (ie, biological
female individuals falling into the category of phenotypic male
individuals) were significantly (ie, 3 times) more likely to have
a diagnosis of ASD than biological female individuals with a
class probability lower than 0.5 (P = .72 vs .24, respectively;
χ2
1 = 20.26; P < .001; difference in P values, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.29-
0.68). Reciprocally, male individuals with class probabilities
lower than 0.5 (ie, biological male individuals falling into the
category of phenotypic female individuals) were 1.2 times
less likely to have ASD than male individuals allocated to the
category of phenotypic male individuals (P = .41 vs .51,

respectively; χ2
1 = 0.38; P > .53; difference in P values, −0.10;
95% CI, −0.36 to 0.15) (eFigure 3B in the Supplement). If one
combines these sample probabilities with previously pub-
lished prevalence rates of ASD in the general population (eg,
1:42 for male individuals and 1:189 for female individuals31), our
study shows that biological female individuals with male neu-
roanatomical features were 6.5 times more likely to have ASD
than biological female individuals with a characteristically fe-
male neuroanatomy, which translates to an estimated vari-
ability in population prevalence between 0.2% to 1.3%, re-
spectively (eTable 2 in the Supplement). Therefore, normative
sex-related phenotypic diversity in brain structure signifi-
cantly affected the probability of ASD in addition to biologi-
cal sex alone, with male neuroanatomical characteristics car-
ryingahigherintrinsicriskforASDthanfemalecharacteristics.
The particular patterns of neuroanatomical variability as-
sociatedwithloworhighASDprobabilitydifferedbetweenmen
and women in sign and regional composition (Figure 2 and
eTable 3 and eFigure 4 in the Supplement). For example, CT
variability in the left and right inferior temporal lobe differ-
entiated between low or high risk in women but not in men
(tmax = 3.78,clusterP = 6.29 × 10−6fortheleft;tmax = 3.47,clus-
ter P = 1.09 × 10−2 for the right). Therefore, while it is pos-
sibletolinktheprobabilityofASDtoparticularpatternsofneu-
roanatomical variability in CT, our findings suggest that these
patterns are sex specific.
Biological Sex Significantly Modulates
the Cortical Anatomy of ASD
Last, using a conventional general linear model, we tested
for significant CT differences between men and women
with ASD and group × sex interactions. We found that the
cortical neuroanatomy of ASD was significantly modulated
by biological sex, particularly in the bilateral parahippocam-
pal and entorhinal cortex (Brodmann area [BA] 28/34), the
fusiform and lingual gyrus (BA 20/37/19), and the inferior or
middle temporal lobe (BA 21/22) (Figure 3 and eTable 4 and
eFigure 5 in the Supplement). In these regions, the degree of
cortical abnormality in female individuals significantly
exceeded the degree of abnormality observed in male indi-
viduals compared with their respective normative popula-
tions (t = 3.29, cluster P = 3.5 × 10−6 for the left; t = 3.42, clus-
ter P = 5.49 × 10−4 for the right) (Figure 3B and C and eFigure
6 in the Supplement). However, female individuals with ASD
were not more significantly impaired than male individuals
in clinical symptom severity (eTable 5 in the Supplement).

The clusters with significant group × sex interactions also
remained significant when controlling for variability in verbal
and performance IQ (eTable 5 and eFigure 7 in the Supple-
ment) and thus do not seem to reflect a simple functional dif-
ference in these clinical or neurocognitive measures (further

Discussion
Our study demonstrates that normative sex-related pheno-
typic diversity in brain structure affects the prevalence of
ASD in addition to biological sex alone, with male neuroana-
tomical characteristics carrying a higher intrinsic risk for
ASD than female characteristics. This increase in risk was
predominantly driven by female individuals with ASD, who
displayed a pattern of neuroanatomical variability in CT that
resembled more closely the neurotypical male rather than
female neurophenotype overall. Moreover, our study links
low and high risk (ie, probability) of ASD to particular pat-
terns of sex-related neuroanatomical variability, thus provid-
ing important novel insights into the neurobiological mecha-
nisms underpinning the male preponderant prevalence of
ASD.
An important feature of GPC is that it is possible to sum-
marize the highly complex and multivariate pattern of nor-
mative sex-related phenotypic diversity in brain structure to

Predictive maps (ie, w × CT) associated with low and high probability of ASD in
female individuals (A) and male individuals (B). Low ASD probability maps were
computed across all male individuals (or female individuals) with predictive
probabilities lower than 0.5 (ie, biological male individuals or female individuals
falling into the category of phenotypic female individuals). High ASD probability
maps were computed across all male individuals (or female individuals) with
predictive probabilities larger than 0.5 (ie, biological male individuals or female
individuals falling into the category of phenotypic male individuals). At each
vertex, the color scale thus indicates the product of the weight vector w and
cortical thickness (CT), averaged across all individuals within the 4 probability
groups. The probability of ASD was determined as the number of male
individuals (or female individuals) with ASD relative to the total number of
individuals within predictive probability bins.

investigation of interindividual phenotypic diversity across
the binary categories dictated by biological sex. This study is
of importance because it has recently been suggested that, on
a phenotypic scale, the brain should be considered a
“mosaic” of regions, each of relative maleness or femaleness,
resulting in significant interindividual variability both within
and between sexes.11,35 Therefore, the multivariate patterns
derived from the classification between neurotypical male
and female controls may be interpreted as being representa-
tive of such a mosaic, which drives the brain toward a female
or male phenotypic end point overall (see also the study by
Chekroud et al36).
Furthermore, we demonstrated that the normative pat-
tern of sex-related neuroanatomical variability is predictive
of ASD probability, particularly in female individuals, and
that low and high ASD probability can be linked to regional
differences in CT. These patterns not only included many of
the brain regions where women typically differ from men in
CT12,13 but also highlighted brain areas that have previously
been linked to the core behavioral deficits characteristic of
ASD (reviewed by Amaral et al37 and by Ecker et al38). Nota-
bly, some of these brain regions (eg, inferior temporal lobes)
carried low or high probability of ASD in women but not in
men. Herein, we found that the degree of cortical abnormal-
ity in female individuals with ASD significantly exceeded the
degree of abnormality in male individuals compared with
their respective normative population. Yet, female individu-
als with ASD were not more severely impaired than male
individuals on the level of autistic symptoms. Therefore, our
finding agrees with previous reports suggesting that (1) bio-
logical sex significantly modulates the neurobiological basis
of ASD (eg, the studies by Lai et al6 and by Schaer et al7) and
(2) female individuals may have a higher threshold (ie, mini-
mum liability sufficient to cause ASD) for reaching affection
status than male individuals (reviewed by Werling and
Geschwind5) and may need to deviate more neurobiologi-
cally from their normative population to demonstrate a clini-
cal ASD phenotype.
Limitations
Whileourapproachholdspromiseforfutureinvestigationsinto
the neurobiological mechanisms that underpin risk and resil-
ience for conditions with a sex difference in prevalence, this
study has several limitations. First, our study was designed to
establish the statistical association between normative sex–
related phenotypic diversity and ASD probability. Therefore,
future studies are needed to examine the causal mechanisms
for this association (eg, as shown by Lai et al8 and Baron-
Cohen et al39). Second, because of reasons outlined above,
we based our study on measures of CT in a sample of high-
functioning adults with ASD. While this scope is sufficient to
provide proof of concept, it will be necessary in the future to
extendourapproachtootherneurobiologicalfeaturesthathave
previously been linked to ASD (eg, cortical surface area and re-
gional volumes14) and to replicate our findings in other sub-
groups on the autism spectrum (eg, different age groups and
individuals with learning disabilities). Third, in future re-
search, it will be crucial to further explore the functional rel-
evance of our findings and to examine how normative sex-
related phenotypic diversity in brain structure relates to sex
differences in general cognitive or behavioral profiles (eg, as
shown by Miller and Halpern40 and by Hyde41) and to differ-
ent clinical ASD phenotypes.3,42-44
Conclusions
Our findings suggest that the neurobiological male pheno-
type carries a higher intrinsic risk for ASD than the female phe-
notype across the binary categories dictated by biological sex.
In addition to genetic and environmental factors, normative
sex-related phenotypic diversity should thus be taken into ac-
count when determining an individual’
s probability of ASD.
Therefore, our approach to modeling normative sex-related
phenotypic diversity may be more widely used in the future
toelucidatetheneurobiologicalmechanismsthatunderpinrisk
and resilience for mental health disorders.
