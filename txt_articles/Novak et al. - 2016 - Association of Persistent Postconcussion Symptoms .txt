IMPORTANCE Persistent postconcussion symptoms (PPCS) pose long-term challenges and
can negatively affect patients’ health-related quality of life (HRQoL). To date, no large
comprehensive study has addressed the association between PPCS and HRQoL.
OBJECTIVES To determine the association between HRQoL and PPCS at 4 weeks after
concussion and assess the degree of impairment of HRQoL in the subsequent 12 weeks.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS In a prospective, multicenter cohort study (Predicting
Persistent Postconcussive Problems in Pediatrics [5P]) from August 14, 2013, to September
30, 2014, children aged 5 to 18 years who presented to the emergency department within 48
hours after head injury and were considered to have an acute concussion were enrolled
across 9 pediatric emergency departments within the Pediatric Emergency Research Canada
Network. Persistent postconcussion symptoms were defined as 3 or more persistent
symptoms on the validated Post-Concussion Symptom Inventory at 4 weeks. Linear mixed
effects random coefficients models evaluated the association between PPCS and HRQoL,
adjusting for potential confounders including age, sex, prior concussions, migraine, anxiety,
learning disability, depression, and sleep disorder.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was HRQoL assessed with the
validated Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory version 4.0 (PedsQL-4.0) at 4, 8, and 12 weeks
after head injury.
RESULTS Of 2006 children enrolled (median age, 11.8 years [interquartile range, 8.9-14.6
years]; 1241 boys and 765 girls), 1667 (83.1%) completed the PedsQL-4.0 at all 3 time points.
Of these 1667 children, the 510 with PPCS (30.6%) had lower total PedsQL-4.0 scores (mean,
70.0) than did those without PPCS (mean, 80.3; mean difference, –10.3; 95% CI, −9.4 to
−11.2). Patients with PPCS also had significantly lower physical, emotional, social, and school
PedsQL-4.0 subscores at 4, 8, and 12 weeks. Patients with PPCS had lower HRQoL than
published healthy norms at 4 weeks (mean difference, 13.89; 95% CI, 11.55-16.23), 8 weeks
(mean difference, 11.63; 95% CI, 9.34-13.93), and 12 weeks (mean difference, 9.38; 95% CI,
7.01-11.75; P < .001). Patients who recovered from concussion also had lower HRQoL than
norms at 4 weeks (mean difference, 3.56; 95% CI, 1.28-5.85) and 8 weeks (mean difference,
2.75; 95% CI, 0.48-5.02; P < .05). School functioning PedsQL-4.0 subscores were
significantly lower for all children regardless of PPCS status at all time points.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Children with PPCS have lower HRQoL compared with those
who have recovered from concussion, yet deficits in HRQoL are pervasive across all domains
and may persist for months even in children whose symptoms have resolved. Future
interventional research should target the effect of concussion on HRQoL.

Although many children recover quickly, approxi-
mately 30% experience persistent postconcussion
symptoms (PPCS) for at least 1 month4 to years after head in-
jury, which may lead to significant functional morbidity.5,6 The
International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related
Health Problems, Tenth Revision defines PPCS as an increase
from perceived preconcussion baseline of 3 or more concus-
sionsymptomsat28daysfollowingtheinjury.7Persistentpost-
concussion symptoms can include ongoing physical symp-
toms, cognitive problems, decreased mood, and behavior
changes.6 Prolonged symptoms after a concussion may detri-
mentally affect participation in academic and recreational ac-
tivities, thereby reducing social interactions.6,8,9 Lower edu-
cational attainment and employment status have been
identified in young adults who experienced concussion as
children.10 As a result, PPCS may pose long-term challenges,
thus reducing health-related quality of life (HRQoL),6 a mul-
tidimensional concept representing one’
s perceived health
status.
Several studies have shed light on pediatric HRQoL fol-
lowing head injuries. Strong associations exist between
moderate to severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) and lower
HRQoL, particularly in psychosocial functioning (eg, emo-
tional, social, and school), compared with individuals who
experienced only orthopedic injuries.11,12 A limited number
of studies have addressed HRQoL in patients with mild TBI,
suggesting that PPCS is associated with lower physical and
psychosocial HRQoL up to 12 months after injury, as well as
an increased need for educational interventions.6,13,14
Despite these important findings, previous studies are lim-
ited by small sample sizes and lengthy intervals between
concussion and enrollment into the study (introducing
potential selection bias toward patients with chronic concus-
sion). Therefore, large comprehensive studies are warranted
to address the association between PPCS and HRQoL as a
function of the recovery timeline.15 Ultimately, better under-
standing of children’
s outcomes after concussion is needed
to provide an improved standard of care focusing on the
patient’
s physical, mental, and social well-being.16
The primary objective of this study was to determine the
association between PPCS and HRQoL at 4 weeks after con-
cussion in children aged 5 through 18 years. We hypothesized
that HRQoL would be significantly lower at 4 weeks in chil-
dren with PPCS than in children without PPCS. We had the fol-
lowing 3 secondary objectives: (1) evaluating the progression
of global HRQoL and its subcomponents (physical, emo-
tional, social, and school), (2) comparing HRQoL of both PPCS
and non-PPCS groups with published healthy norms, and (3)
identifying independent associations of change in overall
HRQoL from 4 to 12 weeks after concussion.
Methods
This was a planned secondary analysis of data from the Pre-
dicting Persistent Postconcussive Problems in Pediatrics (here-
after to be referred to as 5P) study conducted from August 14,
2013, to September 30, 2014; the protocol17 and clinical pre-
diction score for PPCS4 have been previously published.
Study Population
The study uses the same inclusion and exclusion criteria as the
5P protocol.17 Participants recruited were children aged 5
through 18 years who presented to the emergency depart-
ment (ED) within 48 hours after head injury and were consid-
ered to have a concussion as defined by Zurich criteria.18 Chil-
dren were excluded if they had any of the following: Glasgow
Coma Scale score of 13 or less; abnormal neuroimaging find-
ings; a need for neurosurgical operative intervention, intuba-
tion, or intensive care; multisystem injuries requiring hospi-
tal admission, operating room, or procedural sedation; severe
chronic neurologic developmental delay; or intoxication.
Study Setting
Participants were enrolled from the EDs of the following 9 Ca-
nadian pediatric hospitals within the Pediatric Emergency Re-
search Canada Network: Izaak Walton Killam Health Centre,
Halifax, Nova Scotia; Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Ste.-
Justine, Montreal, Quebec; Montreal Children’
s Hospital, Mc-
Gill University Health Centre, Montreal, Quebec; Children’
s
Hospital of Eastern Ontario, Ottawa, Ontario; The Hospital for
Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario; Children’
s Hospital of West-
ern Ontario, London, Ontario; Children’
s Hospital of Winni-
peg, Winnipeg, Manitoba; Stollery Children’
s Hospital, Ed-
monton, Alberta; and Alberta Children’
s Hospital, Calgary,
Alberta. These EDs have a combined annual census of approxi-
mately 500 000 patient-visits. The research ethics commit-
tee at each participating institution approved the study.
Design
Recruitment
Details of patient recruitment are outlined in the published 5P
protocol.17 Briefly, children presenting to the ED with a head
injury were considered to be potentially eligible for the study.
Trained research assistants screened patients for eligibility;
families that qualified were approached for and provided writ-
ten consent in all cases and patient assent where applicable.
Key Points
Question What is the association between persistent
postconcussion symptoms and overall health-related
quality-of-life (HRQoL) in children following an acute concussion?
Findings This multicenter cohort study of children aged 5 to 18
years confirmed that those with persistent postconcussion
symptoms had significantly lower global as well as physical,
emotional, social, and school HRQoL subscores than did those
without persistent postconcussion symptoms. Furthermore, even
children whose symptoms resolved quickly reported lower school
HRQoL subscores compared with published healthy norms
through 12 weeks after head injury.
Meaning Children with persistent postconcussion symptoms
have lower HRQoL subscores compared with those who recovered
from concussion, yet HRQoL deficits may persist for months even
in children whose symptoms have resolved.

Standardized Assessment of Concussion
Withhelpfromresearchassistants,participantsansweredques-
tions in electronic survey format in their first language (Eng-
lish or French) using a portable tablet computer. In addition
to questions about patient demographics, parents completed
the Acute Concussion Evaluation, a 22-item dichotomous vali-
dated tool used to objectively help diagnose concussion (as in-
dicatedby≥1symptomsontheAcuteConcussionEvaluation).19
Data were further collected on injury characteristics, history
(prior concussion, headache, and developmental or psychiat-
ric disorder), and presenting symptoms (physical, emotional,
cognitive and sleep) through the Post-Concussion Symptom
Inventory (PCSI).20,21
Follow-Up
Participantswerecontactedat1,2,4,8,and12weeksafterhead
injury (eTable 1 in the Supplement) by either an automated fol-
low-up web survey using Research Electronic Data Capture or
atelephonefollow-upsurvey.Intheeventthatparticipantsdid
not complete the electronic survey within 24 hours of re-
ceipt, a second email was sent. If there was still no response,
the family was contacted by telephone for an interview. The
follow-up questionnaires included the PCSI at all follow-up
dates and the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory version 4.0
(PedsQL-4.0) at 4-, 8-, and 12-week follow-up.
Outcome Measures
Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory Version 4.0
The primary outcome measure was the total score on the Ped-
sQL-4.0, a reliable and valid measure of HRQoL in healthy chil-
dren and those with acute and/or chronic health conditions.22
Parent versions exist for children aged 2 to 18 years (in 4 age
groups) and child versions exist for those 5 years or older. Pa-
tients 8 years or older completed the child PedsQL-4.0, while
parents of children aged 5 through 8 years completed the par-
ent version. Items are calculated and transformed into an over-
all score with a range of 0 to 100 points, with more points in-
dicating better HRQoL. Secondary outcomes included the
PedsQL-4.0 subscale scores: physical, emotional, social, and
school (8, 5, 5, and 5 items, respectively). The self-report Ped-
sQL-4.0 normative scores for a healthy child23 are as follows:
mean total, 83.9; physical, 87.7; emotional, 79.2; social, 84.9;
and school, 81.3.
Post-Concussion Symptom Inventory
The PCSI was used to measure the persistence and severity of
symptoms. The PCSI is a valid and reliable set of symptom
scales for parents (20 items on a 7-point Likert scale) and chil-
dren aged 5 to 7 years (13 items on a 3-point scale), 8 to 12
years (17 items on a 3-point scale), and 13 to 18 years (21 items
on a 7-point scale), with excellent internal consistency and
interrater agreement.20,21 The PCSI measures symptoms in
physical, cognitive, emotional, and sleep domains. Symptoms
were defined as the absolute difference between the current
self-reported PCSI ratings and those from before the injury.
To be considered as having PPCS, patients were required to
have a positive minimum 1-point change for 3 or more
symptoms.4,17
Statistical Analysis
The primary objective of this study was to determine the as-
sociation between HRQoL and PPCS at 4 weeks after concus-
sion. Health-related quality of life was calculated using scor-
ing instructions for the PedsQL-4.0. Descriptive statistics were
usedtosummarizethedata.Differencesbetweenpatientswho
completed the PedsQL-4.0 and PCSI and those who did not
were compared at each time point using χ2 and Mann-
Whitney tests where appropriate. Variables associated with
HRQoL (total score) were identified by using parametric and
nonparametric tests (t tests and Wilcoxon rank sum tests). For
the primary outcome, linear mixed effects random coeffi-
cient models were used to evaluate the association between
PPCS and HRQoL over time, adjusting for variables associ-
ated with univariate analyses or supported by observations
from clinical practice. This method resulted in a model with
fixed effects of PPCS, time, interaction of PPCS with time, age,
sex, previous concussion, duration of previous concussion
symptoms, prior treatment for headache, personal history of
migraines, learning disability, anxiety, depression, and sleep
disorder. The mixed effects procedure avoids listwise dele-
tionowingtomissingdata.Next,theestimatedmarginalmeans
at each time point were compared with the child self-report
mean total score from a sample of healthy children23 using a z
test with correction for multiple comparisons using the Holm
method. Secondary analyses examining the association
between PPCS and the PedsQL-4.0 subscale scores (physical,
emotional, social, school) were conducted identically. All
analyses were performed using SPSS, version 21 (IBM Corp),
and R, version 3.0.2 (R Project for Statistical Computing). All
P values were 2-sided, and P < .05 was considered statisti-
cally significant.
Results
Ofthe5229patientsscreenedforeligibility,2006childrenwere
enrolled, of which 1667 (83.1%) completed the primary out-
come survey at 4 weeks (eFigure in the Supplement). Of these
1667 children, 510 (30.6%) had PPCS at 4 weeks after injury.
Table 1 describes the enrolled patients’baseline characteris-
tics.Minimaldifferenceswerefoundbetweenpatientswhodid
and did not complete the PedsQL-4.0 and PCSI (eTable 2 in the
Supplement).Participantswithattention-deficitdisorderorat-
tention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder were less likely to re-
spond at 8 weeks (77% vs 84%) and 12 weeks (72% vs 78%;
P = .05), and participants with a history of 2 or more concus-
sions were less likely to respond at 12 weeks (72% vs 79%;
P = .04).
For our primary outcome, at 4 weeks, children with PPCS
had a significantly lower PedsQL-4.0 total score than did chil-
dren without PPCS (70.0 vs 80.3; mean difference, –10.3; 95%
CI, –9.4 to –11.2). Lower PedsQL-4.0 total score in the PPCS
group persisted at each follow-up time point compared with
the group without PPCS. The mean difference in PedsQL-4.0
total score between the groups was –8.9 (95% CI, −8.2 to −9.6)
at 8 weeks and –7.4 (95% CI, −6.5 to −8.4) at 12 weeks. Figure 1

groupswithandwithoutPPCS.23Althoughbothgroupsshowed
increases in PedsQL-4.0 total scores over time (β = 0.56; 95%
CI, 0.43-0.70; P < .001), the scores for the PPCS group in-
creased faster than did the scores for the group without PPCS
from 4 to 12 weeks after concussion, as reflected in a signifi-
cant interaction of PPCS with time (β = 0.36; 95% CI, 0.21-
0.51; P < .001).
Figure 2 displays the PedsQL-4.0 subscale scores (physi-
cal, emotional, social, and school) of children with and with-
out PPCS at 4, 8, and 12 weeks of follow-up.23 The PPCS group
scored significantly lower on all subscales compared with the
group without PPCS. This finding was consistent at each fol-
low-up point (weeks 4, 8, and 12) for all subscales (Table 2).23
Usingpublishedhealthynorms,wecomparedthetotaland
subscale PedsQL-4.0 scores for all patients with concussion
(both those with and without PPCS). The estimated marginal
means of patients with PPCS were significantly lower than the
healthy population mean of 83.9 at 4, 8, and 12 weeks (eTable
3 in the Supplement). Patients without PPCS had significantly
lower estimated marginal means than the healthy population
mean at weeks 4 and 8, but not at week 12 (eTable 3 in the
Supplement). Compared with published norms, children with
PPCS scored significantly lower than healthy children at ev-
ery time point for the physical, emotional, and school sub-
scales (eTable 3 in the Supplement). Children with PPCS scored
lower on the social subscale at 4 weeks but not at 8 or 12 weeks
(eTable 3 in the Supplement). In comparison, children with-
out PPCS did not have significantly lower physical, emo-
tional, or social scores compared with healthy children at any
ofthetimepoints(eTable3intheSupplement).However,scores
on the school subscale were significantly lower (eTable 3 in the
Supplement) for children without PPCS at all time points.
Finally, we examined factors significantly associated with
lower overall HRQoL. Variables associated with lower HRQoL
during3monthsincludedfemalesex,previousconcussion,his-
tory of migraine, learning disability, and anxiety disorder
(Table 3).
Discussion
Children with PPCS report significantly lower overall HRQoL
for up to 12 weeks after concussion when compared with chil-
dren whose symptoms resolve within the first 4 weeks after
injury. The detriments to HRQoL are pervasive across all do-
mains (physical, emotional, social, and school functioning).
All children with concussion (regardless of duration of symp-
toms after injury) have significantly lower HRQoL compared
with published norms. Furthermore, even children who re-
ported resolution of symptoms exhibited prolonged declines
in HRQoL relative to healthy norms owing primarily to detri-
ments in school functioning. However, both the HRQoL in chil-
dren with and without PPCS improved over time.

Results of our study are consistent with those of smaller
studies reporting decrements in the HRQoL of children fol-
lowing concussion. Moran et al13 concluded that higher ini-
tial symptom burden puts patients at risk for lasting declines
in HRQoL and thus suggest that PPCS may be a target for im-
proving HRQoL. Furthermore, Ransom et al24 determined that
symptomatic children and their parents report greater diffi-
culties at school after concussion than their nonsymptomatic
counterparts. Similarly, children who were no longer symp-
tomatic after concussion also had school difficulties, with
nearly half reporting diminished academic skills and trouble
in at least 1 class during their recovery. These results are sup-
ported by our findings, which established that even asymp-
tomatic children reported lower PedsQL-4.0 school function-
ing compared with healthy norms for at least 12 weeks after
head injury. Our results indicate that school functioning is the
last domain of HRQoL to resolve in both children with PPCS
and those with concussion but without PPCS.
There are several hypotheses for the delayed effect of con-
cussion on school functioning in children with PPCS and those
without PPCS. First, our results may reflect a direct cognitive
effect of concussion on pediatric HRQoL. A second hypoth-
esis involves an epiphenomenon of the injury situation. As a
student recovers from a concussion, schoolwork begins to ac-
cumulate,whichmaybestressfulforcertainchildren.Afterthe
student has largely recovered, completing the accumulated
work takes time, and some children still feel this stress when
noothersymptomsarepresent.Therefore,theirschoolHRQoL
reports may reflect the effect of this stress. Third, our baseline
school measure did not differentiate between quality of school
functioningbeforeandaftertheconcussion.Therefore,itispos-
sible that reports of school difficulties may be associated with
those already present before the concussion.
Comparing our findings with those of other studies
reporting on HRQoL among children with chronic illness
provides insight into the potential effect of concussion on

HRQoL. For instance, 1 month after hematopoietic stem cell
transplantation, children report a mean total PedsQL-4.0
score of 74, similar to that in our overall concussion cohort.25
Children with PPCS reported a lower HRQoL than that
reported by children with type 1 diabetes, whose PedsQL-4.0
scores are similar to those in our group without PPCS.26 Fur-
thermore, both children with and without PPCS scored
below healthy norms on the PedsQL-4.0 school functioning
subscale, which seems to be the subscale most affected by
chronic health conditions.23
Several studies have examined independent associations
with poor HRQoL after concussion. For instance, Scholten et
al,27 in a cohort of adults with mild, moderate, and severe
TBI, identified female sex and medical comorbidities as the
strongest associations with decreased HRQoL at 6 and 12
months after TBI. Furthermore, pediatric patients with TBI
exhibited improvement in the initial 3 to 24 months after
injury compared with their baseline PedsQL-4.0 results28;
however, significant long-term HRQoL impairments
remained without further improvement from 24 to 36
months.29 Significant associations of poor functioning after
pediatric mild TBI included lower parental education, His-
panic race/ethnicity, low household income, and Medicaid
insurance.30 Additional studies have found that repeated
concussions may lead to greater cognitive dysfunction and
neuropsychiatric conditions, which themselves can nega-
tively affect pediatric HRQoL.31,32 Furthermore, female sex,
previous TBI, and neurologic and psychological illness were
associated with PPCS in both children and adults.33-35 Female
sex and prior concussion were also identified in our study,
along with migraine history, learning disability, and/or anxi-
ety disorder as independently associated with overall HRQoL
decrement in children after concussion.
The study has several strengths that contribute to the
validity of our results. First, to our knowledge, this is the
largest prospective multicenter study to date examining the
effect of pediatric concussion on HRQoL. We collected a
large sample from a geographically diverse population from
pediatric hospitals across Canada, with participants being
included despite preexisting behavioral, learning, or psycho-
logical problems. By excluding patients presenting more
than 48 hours after head injury, we ensured that our results
are applicable to any child presenting for acute concussion
assessment and not biased toward those presenting with
persisting symptoms. Our data are bolstered by the stan-
dardization of training for all research staff. Furthermore, we
used validated outcome variables and achieved excellent
follow-up rates.
This study has several potential limitations. First, we did
not include a control group, and thus we are unable to di-
rectly attribute PPCS and its effect on HRQoL to concussion.
However, we did compare our results with published norma-
tive data. Second, we used only self-report for assessing both
PPCS and HRQoL in the group 8 years or older, introducing
shared rater variance. However, parent-child agreement re-
garding PPCS and HRQoL is only moderate, so using different
raters might underestimate the association of PPCS with
HRQoL.19,36 Moreover, as we included only children with con-
cussions who presented to the ED within 48 hours of their in-
jury, our results may not be generalizable to those presenting
with delayed-onset symptoms, those not seeking care, or seek-
ing care outside the ED (as only few children with concussion
may seek ED care).37 Patients in the ED may be primed to have
lower HRQoL and/or higher risk of PPCS, but since we did not
collect baseline PedsQL-4.0 assessments, we were unable to
assess their HRQoL before injury. This fact, plus our nontrial
study design, precluded our ability to determine causality.
Future research should examine if PPCS leads to poor
HRQoL or vice versa, with subsequent interventions target-
ing the root cause.

Conclusions
ChildrenwithPPCShadsignificantlylowertotal,physical,emo-
tional,social,andschoolqualityoflifethatpersistedforatleast
12 weeks after concussion than did children with no PPCS.
Overall, both patients with and without PPCS with concus-
sion report declines in overall and school quality of life rela-
tive to healthy norms.23 Finally, the following independent as-
sociations with HRQoL decrement in children after concussion
were identified: female sex, having a previous concussion, his-
tory of migraine, learning disability, or anxiety disorder. Re-
sults from our study provide insight into the psychosocial bur-
den of pediatric concussion and may help identify patients and
families requiring extra support or guidance regarding man-
agement of expectations and coping mechanisms after con-
cussion. Finally, our results will help guide future interven-
tions to reduce the effect of concussion on HRQoL.
Knowledge translation and mobilization is an important
next step to ensure that parents, teachers, school administra-
tors, and educational boards are aware of the effect of con-
cussion on children’
s HRQoL in school. Health care profes-
sionals should identify patients and families at higher risk for
PPCS and decreased HRQoL.
