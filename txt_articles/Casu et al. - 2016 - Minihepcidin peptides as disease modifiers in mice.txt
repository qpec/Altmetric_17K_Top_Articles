Key Points
• Investigation of the iron-
restrictive effect of
minihepcidin peptides in the
treatment of b-thalassemia
and polycythemia vera.
In b-thalassemia and polycythemia vera (PV), disordered erythropoiesis triggers se-
vere pathophysiological manifestations. b-Thalassemia is characterized by ineffective
erythropoiesis, reduced production of erythrocytes, anemia, and iron overload and PV by
erythrocytosis and thrombosis. Minihepcidins are hepcidin agonists that have been
previously shown to prevent iron overload in murine models of hemochromatosis and
induce iron-restricted erythropoiesis at higher doses. Here, we show that in young Hbbth3/1
mice, which serve as a model of untransfused b-thalassemia, minihepcidin ameliorates
ineffective erythropoiesis, anemia, and iron overload. In older mice with untransfused
b-thalassemia, minihepcidin improves erythropoiesis and does not alter the beneficial effect of the iron chelator deferiprone on iron
overload. In PV mice that express the orthologous JAK2 mutation causing human PV, administration of minihepcidin significantly
reduces splenomegaly and normalizes hematocrit levels. These studies indicate that drug-like minihepcidins have a potential as future
therapeutics for untransfused b-thalassemia and PV. (Blood. 2016;128(2):265-276)
Introduction
In b-thalassemia, mutations in the b-globin gene lead to a relative
excess of a-globin, which, together with heme, forms hemichromes,
moleculeswithtoxicpotentialtotriggerreactiveoxygenspecies(ROS),
apoptosis of erythroid progenitors,and short-lived erythrocytes.1-3This
results in anemia, chronically high levels of erythropoietin, and
ineffective erythropoiesis—overproduction of erythroid progenitors
that fail to generate mature erythrocytes.4 Even when transfusions are
not required, the manifestations of the disease can be severe, including
chronic anemia and splenomegaly as well as pulmonary hypertension
and an increased risk of thrombosis.4 Anemia and ineffective
erythropoiesis also cause increased iron absorption mediated by
duodenal hypoxia and erythroid-mediated suppression of the iron
regulator hepcidin.5-10 The resulting iron overload adds to morbidity
by causing cirrhosis, risk of cardiomyopathy, and hepatocarcinoma
and exacerbating erythroid cell damage, apoptosis, and ineffective
erythropoiesis.1 Even untransfused patients with b-thalassemia may
require iron chelation to avoid the morbidity and mortality associ-
ated with severeiron overload.1 Usinga mousemodelof untransfused
b-thalassemia(Hbbth3/1),wepreviouslyshowedthatanemia,ineffective
erythropoiesis, and iron overload were ameliorated by increasing
hepcidin and causing iron restriction, yielding diminished hemi-
chrome formation and decreased erythroid cell damage.2,3 Another
disease in which iron restriction is known to be beneficial is
polycythemia vera (PV). PV is a myeloproliferative disorder triggered
by activating mutations in JAK2, an important kinase in the principal
signaling pathway of the erythropoietin (EPO) receptor.11-15 Most
of the clinical manifestations of PV are caused by an increased
erythrocyte count, leading to an increased risk of pulmonary
hypertension and thrombosis. The mainstay of therapy for PV is
therapeutic phlebotomy, the goal of which is to reduce the hematocrit
(HCT) level to #45% to minimize the risk of thrombosis.16 Because
phlebotomy does not influence the underlying defect in bone marrow
(BM) red blood cell (RBC) production, the effect of phlebotomy
is transient, until patients become iron deficient. As alternative
approaches, evidence suggests that systemic iron deficiency or
erythroid-targeted iron restriction could be effective in PV patients via
inhibition of erythropoietin signaling downstream of JAK2.11-15
Minihepcidins are small engineered peptides that reproduce the iron-
restrictive effects of the hormone hepcidin.17,18 In a mouse model

 minihepcidin prevented iron overload and caused partial re-
distribution of iron from the liver to the spleen.17,18 Minihepci-
dins caused dose-dependent inhibition of intestinal iron absorption
and, at higher doses, restricted the iron supply to erythropoiesis. Based
on these observations, this study investigates whether minihepcidin
ameliorates anemia and iron overload in b-thalassemic mice and
prevents erythrocytosis in PV mice.

Figure 1. The iron-restrictive effect of minihepcidin peptide M004 improved ineffective erythropoiesis in a mouse model of thalassemia intermedia. Administration
of M004 (2.625 mg/kg) in 2-month-old Hbbth3/1 animals twice a week for 6 weeks resulted in increased RBC count (A), improved anemia (as shown by increased Hb levels)
(B), reduced splenomegaly (C), and reticulocyte count (D). Hemichrome formation was markedly reduced, as indicated by the reduced intensity of the a precipitates in animals
treated with minihepcidin compared with control group (TAU gel) (E). ROS formation was also significantly reduced (F). To measure ROS levels, the erythroid compartment was
at first analyzed by staining BM and spleen cells with CD44 and Ter119 antibodies that allowed the separation of erythroid cells into 5 distinct populations. The cells were then
stained for ROS detection using the indicator CM-H2DCFDA. Here, we show a representative example of the ROS-positive cells (for control and treated groups) in the fraction
that represents mature RBCs (F). RBC morphology (shown by Giemsa staining of peripheral blood smear) was markedly improved by M004 administration (G) and lifespan
normalized (H). As a result of decreased erythroid iron uptake, total organ iron content was significantly reduced in liver (I) and kidney (J). Perls’ Prussian blue staining on liver,
spleen, and kidney sections of animals receiving vehicle or M004 shows that parenchymal iron is reduced (liver, kidney) while retention of iron in the splenic macrophage is
increased (K). Images were captured using a Leica DM4000B upright scope paired with a Spot RT/SE Slider camera (103/numerical aperture 0.40 objective) and then acquired
using the Spot 5.1 software. Perls’ Prussian blue staining in spleen sections revealed increased iron retention, but when organ weight was taken in consideration, the spleen iron
concentration was statistically reduced in M004-treated vs vehicle-treated animals (L). Results are presented as mean 6 SD; ***P , .001, **P , .01, and *P , .05, 2-tailed Mann-

From 
 We used Hbbth3/1 mice (The Jackson Laboratory) as a model of b-thalassemia
intermedia. An animal model of PV was obtained by crossing mice carrying a
Jak2V617FconditionalknockinallelewithmiceexpressingCrerecombinaseunder
the control of VAV regulatory elements (VAV-Cre).11 Jak2V617F/1 VAV-Cre
double-transgenic mice developed a PV-like phenotype, which was transplant-
able, as previously demonstrated.11 To determine if treatment with
minihepcidin could improve hypoxia in our mouse model of b-thalassemia,
the hypoxia reporter mouse, oxygen-dependent degradation luciferase
(ODD-Luc), was crossedwith Hbbth3/1andin vivoluminescenceimaging was
performed at the end point.5 All animals were treated with either vehicle control
orminihepcidin (M004 or M009)by subcutaneous (SC)injections twice a week
for the indicated duration. Hbbth3/1 animals were also exposed to the oral iron
chelator deferiprone (DFP) alone or in combination with minihepcidin. Animals
were sacrificed 3.5 days after the final dose for analyses. Blood samples were
analyzed as previously described.3
Drug preparation
The minihepcidins M004 and M009 were prepared fresh for each administration.
Each drug was formulated in ethanol 100%, SL-220 (SUNBRIGHT) and water at
desired concentration. The ethanol concentration was 10% of the final volume
injected.Minihepcidinswereadministratedtwiceweeklyfor6weeks,anddatawere
collected 3.5 days after the last injection. The iron chelator deferiprone (Sigma-
Aldrich) was added into the drinking water at a concentration of 1.25 mg/mL.
Measurement of tissue iron content and serum iron parameters
Serum parameters (iron, transferrin saturation [TSAT]) were measured using the
Integra 800 Automated Clinical Analyzer (Roche Diagnostics) or the Iron/TIBC
Reagent Set (BioPacific Diagnostic). Serum EPO was analyzed using the
Mouse Erythropoietin Quantikine ELISA Kit (R&D Systems) following the

 manufacturer’s instructions. The level of serum hepcidin was determined
using the Hepcidin-Murine-Compete kit (Intrinsic LifeSciences) following
manufacturer’s instructions. Tissue iron content for Hbbth3/1 was assayed at the
Diagnostic Center for Population and Animal Health at Michigan State University
(Lansing, MI).
Fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis
Erythropoiesis and ROS in BM and spleen cells were analyzed as already
described.2 For all analyses, cells were sorted using a FACSCalibur
instrument (BD Biosciences) and the results analyzed with FlowJo software
(Tree Star).
Analyses of a- and b-globin chains on RBC membranes
To visualize membrane-bound globins (hemichrome), we used urea gel
electrophoresis (TAU gel), which separates a- and b-globin subunits using
denaturing conditions. The same number of erythrocytes was processed for each
sample that was loaded onto the gel (150 3 106).2
Measurement of RBC lifespan
RBCs of Hbbth3/1 mice are characterized by shortened lifespan compared with
wild-type (WT) mice. To evaluate whether treatment with minihepcidin could
improve this feature, we performed lifespan analysis of peripheral RBCs using
flow cytometry as previously described.3
Quantitative polymerase chain reaction
Total RNA from livers was purified using the PureLink RNA Mini Kit (Ambion,
Life Technologies) and analyzed with the SuperScript III Platinum SYBR Green
One-Step qRT-PCR Kit (Invitrogen, Life Technologies). Messenger RNA
concentrations of the target genes were normalized by a housekeeping gene
(GAPDH).
In vivo imaging
ODD-Luc-Hbbth3/1 mice were treated for 6 weeks with biweekly injections of
M004 or vehicle. At the end point, in vivo imaging was performed. Animals
received luciferin substrate by IV injection. Images were captured using the
Xenogen IVIS Optical Imaging System (Xenogen). The system specifically
and quantitatively images the expression of the reporter luciferase (Luc)
gene in mice.
Erythroferrone quantification by ELISA
A sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using mouse
monoclonal antibodies against mouse erythroferrone (Erfe) was performed as
described by Kautz et al.19
Statistics
Data are presented as mean 6 standard deviation (SD). When multiple
comparisons were needed, statistical analysis was performed using one-way
analysisofvariance(ANOVA)withTukeymultiplecomparisonadjustment. For
comparisons between 2 groups, we used a 2-tailed Mann-Whitney U test. All
data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism version 6 (Microsoft GraphPad
Software, La Jolla, CA).
Study approval
All animal studies were conducted under protocols approved by the Institu-
tional Animal Care and Use Committee of Weill Cornell Medical College
and Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia.
Results
Pharmacokinetics of minihepcidin peptides
Studies were performed with 2 minihepcidin peptides, designated
M004 and M009. M004 is a potent analog of the 9 N-terminal
amino acids of hepcidin. M004 reduces cell-surface expression of
ferroportin with a 50% effective concentration of 9.7 nM and
causes .80% reduction in serum iron 24 hours after SC admin-
istration of a dose of 7.5 mg/kg in rats. M004 was discontinued in
favor of M009, which was more stable in aqueous solution and
therefore easier to administer. M009 is a prodrug that is converted to
M004 following systemic administration. Chemically, M009 is the
same as M004, except for the addition of an S-methyl group on Cys7,
and because the iron-restrictive effect of M009 is determined by the
generation of M004, we consider them to be interchangeable
treatments. Administration of M009 at a dose of 7.5 mg/kg generates
high levels of M004 and a .80% reduction in serum iron that was
sustained for at least 48 hours (supplemental Figure 1, available on the
Blood Web site).

 Administration of minihepcidin ameliorated ineffective
erythropoiesis, anemia, splenomegaly, and iron overload in
young Hbbth3/1 mice
Two-to 3-month-old Hbbth3/1mice are anemic and manifest organ iron
overload but do not require RBCs transfusions.20-22 In order to test
whether minihepcidin could improve both iron overload and anemia
in young animals, M004 was administered to 2-month-old Hbbth3/1
male mice. Initial dose-finding studies were conducted using a daily
intraperitoneal injection for 2 to 6 weeks of 0.25 to 5 mg/kg per day. In
these studies, a dose-dependent decrease in TSAT was observed,
consistent with the results observed in WT animals. The dose-
dependenteffectofminihepcidin-inducedironrestrictiononineffective
erythropoiesis in the Hbbth3/1 mouse was biphasic. At the low end
of the tested range (0.25 to 1.25 mg/kg per day), we observed
normalization of the ratio between mature and immature erythroid
cells (CD441-TER1191). This was associated with a 15% increase in
RBC number and a marked reduction in reticulocyte count (62%) and
spleen size(43%) when compared withHbbth3/1 animalsthatreceived
the vehicle (supplemental Figure 2A-B; supplemental Tables 1 and 2).

(A-C). Reticulocyte count (D) and spleen size (E) were
both significantly reduced when animals received mini-
hepcidin alone or in association with DFP, reflecting
improved erythropoietic efficiency. Flow cytometry studies
of BM and spleen erythroid populations from thalassemic
animals that received minihepcidin alone or in combina-
tion with DFP demonstrated reduced levels of ROS
formation (F). As in Figure 1F, we show here a represen-
tative example of ROS-positive cells (control and treated
groups) in the fraction that represents mature RBCs.
Parameters of erythrocyte damage such as red cell
distribution width (RDW; G), hemichrome formation (as
shown with TAU gel; H), and red cell morphology (Giemsa
staining of peripheral blood smear; I) were improved in
animals treated with minihepcidin alone or in combination
with DFP (when compared with control groups and the
standard [st] in panel H). Erythropoietin levels (Epo) were
reduced in animals receiving M009 as a consequence of
improved anemia (J). Results represent mean 6 SD;
****P , .0001, ***P , .001, **P , .01, and *P , .05.
Analysis was performed using one-way ANOVA with
Tukey multiple comparison adjustment. WT data are

From 
 (as low as TSAT 5 6%; supplemental Figure 2C and supplemental
Table 3) was detected, leading to iron-restricted erythropoiesis
and exacerbation of anemia (hemoglobin [Hb] reduction as low as
2.6 g/dL) (supplemental Figure 2D; supplemental Table 4). At these
doses, accumulation of immature erythroid precursors was observed
by flow cytometry studies, reflecting the expected erythroid matura-
tion block caused by severe iron restriction of erythropoiesis
(supplemental Figure 2E, population 1). Prussian blue staining
demonstrated the increased sequestration of iron in splenic macro-
phages and Kupffer cells (supplemental Figure 2F) as expected after
the administration of a hepcidin mimetic. The biphasic effect of
minihepcidin can be attributed to the fact that at very high doses, the
salutary effect of minihepcidin on thalassemic erythropoiesis is
outweighed by the inhibitory effect of very severe iron restriction.
Pharmacokinetic data (supplemental Figure 1) indicated that the
circulating concentration of active minihepcidin peptides remained
high 24 hours after administration and that daily administration would
result in accumulation of peptide, potentially leading to severe iron
restriction. We therefore explored whether less frequent dosing could
achieve sustained improvement in anemia and normalization of tissue
iron with diminished risk of iron-restricted erythropoiesis. The dose of
2.625 mg/kg administered subcutaneously twice weekly was selected
to generate blood concentrations similar to daily dosing of 0.63 to
1.25mg/kgperday.Thelongerdoseintervalinthesestudieswaschosen

From 
 to permit the iron-restrictive effect of each dose to dissipate before the
next injection and thus avoid severely iron-restricted erythropoiesis.
Two-month-old Hbbth3/1 males were treated for 6 weeks, twice
weekly, with M004 or vehicle control by SC injections. Administra-
tion of M004 was associated with an increase in RBCs to levels
observed in WT animals (Figure 1A) and an increase in Hb concentration
of .2 g/dL (Figure 1B). Reduced spleen weight (252%; Figure 1C) and
reticulocyte count (260%; Figure 1D) reflected improved erythropoietic
efficiency, which was further corroborated by flow cytometry studies.
Minihepcidin treatment reduced hemichrome and ROS formation
(Figure 1E-F) and improved RBC morphology and lifespan
(Figure 1G-H). Hematological improvement was likely caused by
enhanced erythroid cell survival resulting from decreased oxidative
damage.Totalorganironaccumulationwasdecreasedby50%intheliver
and 46% in the kidney (Figure 1I-J). Splenic iron concentration increased
by 24%, reflecting retention of iron in splenic macrophages as a result of
increased hepcidin activity (Figure 1K). However, total iron levels in the
spleen were decreased by 42% (Figure 1L).
Minihepcidin ameliorated hypoxia in Hbbth3/1 mice
Hbbth3/1 mice were crossed with the hypoxia reporter mouse, ODD-
Luc.5 In vivo luminescence imaging of these animals showed that mice
affected by b-thalassemia are systemically hypoxic as a result of
inadequate tissue oxygenation (hypoxia).5 ODD-Luc-Hbbth3/1 mice
exhibit increased luminescence (indication of increased hypoxia)
mostly in the abdomen and peripheral areas (such as the paws and
tails) when compared with nonthalassemic mice.
We postulated that minihepcidin administration could reduce tissue
hypoxia by improving tissue oxygenation as a result of increased
Hb levels. ODD-Luc-Hbbth3/1 mice were treated for 6 weeks with
2.625 mg/kg M004 using biweekly SC injections. As shown previously,
thalassemic mice treated with minihepcidin exhibit increased erythrocyte
number and Hb concentration (Figure 2A-B), decreased reticulocytosis,
and reduced splenomegaly (Figure 2C-D). Ineffective erythropoiesis
was also ameliorated, as shown by flow cytometry analysis (Figure 2E).
At the end point, the animals received IV injection of a luciferin sub-
strate followed by in vivo imaging. Analysis of the results revealed a
significant reduction in luminescence mostly in the abdomen of the mice
that received minihepcidin compared with control mice (Figure 2F),
indicating reduced hypoxia due to improved tissue oxygenation.
Beneficial effects on iron overload and erythropoiesis in old
Hbbth3/1 mice after combination therapy of M009 and the iron
chelator deferiprone
Inclinical settings,thetreatmentof b-thalassemia inpatientswith severe
iron overload would likely employ a combination of minihepcidin with
oral chelation therapy. We therefore conducted studies in 4- to 5-month-
old male Hbbth3/1 mice with established iron overload to evaluate
whether the concurrent use of the oral iron chelator DFP and
minihepcidin would cause any therapeutic interactions. M009, which
generates M004incirculation, was administeredsubcutaneously atthe
same dose used in previous studies with M004 (2.625 mg/kg). We first
analyzed the effect of a single injection of M009. This was sufficient to
reduce serum hepcidin up to 36 hours (supplemental Figure 3A), but it
had no effect on serum Erfe concentrations (not shown). In this setting,
the endogenous hepcidinconcentrationreached baseline levels at 48 to
72 hours.
M009 or vehicle control was then administered by SC injections
biweekly for 6 weeks. Mice were stratified to receive free access to
regular water or water containing DFP (1.25 mg/mL). At end-point
analysis, iron-overloaded animals treated with DFP alone showed
significantly decreased liver iron content (Figure 3A). This was
accompanied by a trend toward increased TSAT (Figure 3B) and
serum iron (supplemental Figure 3B), suggesting that DFP by itself
does not restrict iron delivery to the erythron. The combination of
DFP and M009 produced the same reduction in liver iron content as
seen with DFP alone. Levels of serum iron (supplemental
Figure 3B) and TSAT (Figure 3B) in animals that received M009
alone were reduced compared with the DFP-treated animals and
controls, but no differences were detected when the 2 drugs were
administrated simultaneously. No differences in serum hepcidin
concentrations (supplemental Figure 3C), hepcidin messenger RNA
expression (not shown), or expression of other iron-related genes
(supplemental Figure 3D-F) were observed between groups. However,
ELISAassaysofserumErfeindicatedasignificantreductionofthisfactor
(Figure 3C).
Combination of minihepcidin and the iron chelator DFP
improved anemia and reversed splenomegaly in older
Hbbth3/1 mice
Treatment with the minihepcidin M009 alone or in combination with
DFP produced the same profile of hematological changes described
following treatment with M004, resulting in a significant increase in
circulating Hb (Figure 4A), RBC count (Figure 4B), and HCT level
(Figure 4C). No differences in hematological parameters were observed
between DFP-treated and vehicle-treated mice (Figure 4A-C). This
indicates that treatment with the iron chelator alone was not sufficient
to improve erythropoiesis, despite reduced organ iron content.23
Reticulocyte count and spleen size were both reduced with M009 and
M009 1 DFP treatment, reflecting improved erythropoietic efficiency
(Figure 4D-E). Flow cytometry studies of BM and spleen erythroid
populationsfrom minihepcidin-treatedanimals demonstrated an increase
in the relative proportion of mature erythroid cells (Figure 2E) and
reduced levels of ROS (Figure 4F). Parameters of RBC damage (red cell
distribution width) (Figure 4G), hemichrome formation (Figure 4H), and
erythrocyte morphology (Figure 4I) were improved. We previously
demonstrated that Hbbth3/1 animals show increased EPO concentrations
in response to anemia.20,24 Overexpression of EPO leads to increased
phosphorylation of the Jak2 kinase and overexpression of the genes
downstream of the Jak2-Stat5 pathway involved in cell proliferation
and survival.20,24,25 As minihepcidin improved erythropoiesis and
ameliorated anemia, EPO concentrations declined (Figure 4J).
M009 was also used to treat 4-month-old females Hbbth3/1 and
showed a trend similar to that observed in males. We observed
improved liver iron content, hematological parameters, and erythroid
maturation, mostlyin the spleen, as well as a reduction in splenomegaly
(supplemental Figure 4A-F).
Administration of minihepcidin normalized HCT levels and
resolved splenomegaly in a mouse model of PV
The progeny of floxed Jak2V617F/1 mice crossed with a mouse
hemizygous for the Vav-cre transgene expressed in hematopoi-
etic cells can develop PV, and this phenotype can be easily
propagated by engrafting Jak2V617F/1-Vav-cre BM cells into WT
C57BL/6 mice.26 Using these mice, we tested the hypothesis that
minihepcidin-induced iron restriction could work as medical
phlebotomy by reversing erythrocytosis and normalizing the HCT
level in murine PV. To this end, we studied the effects of
markedly higher doses of M009 than were previously used in
studies in the Hbbth3/1 mice to ensure that a high level of iron
restriction (serum iron reduction of .80% throughout the interval
between doses) was present throughout the study.

Figure 5. Beneficial effect of minihepcidin peptide in a mouse model of PV. Mice affected by PV (Jak2V617F/1 VAV-Cre double transgenic) were generated by
transplantation of PV BM cells into lethally irradiated C57Bl/6 recipients. Four weeks post-BMT, when the phenotype was fully established, mice received SC injections of
minihepcidin M009 (10 or 15 mg/kg) or vehicle twice a week for 3 weeks. At end point, hematological parameters such as HCT (A), RBC (B), and Hb (C), normally very high in
PV mice, were significantly reduced (in a dose-dependent manner). Splenomegaly was also reduced (D). BM and spleen erythroid profiles were normalized (E), reflecting
improved erythropoietic activity (as shown in the CD44-FSC [forward scatter] plots). Results represent mean 6 SD; ****P , .0001, ***P , .001, **P , .01, and *P , .05.

From 
 We treated PV mice with vehicle or M009 (10 and 15 mg/kg)
administered by biweekly SC injections for 3 weeks, with end-
point analysis performed 3.5 days after the last injection.
Treatment was initiated 1 month after BM transplantation, when
the PV phenotype had been fully established. At 3 weeks,
treatment showed a dose-dependent reduction (or normalization)
in the HCT level, RBC count, and Hb concentration in animals
receiving minihepcidin when compared with mice exposed to the
vehicle (Figure 5A-C). Splenomegaly was reduced (Figure 5D),
and flow cytometric profiles of erythroid precursors improved
(Figure 5E). Flow cytometry analysis indicated that iron re-
striction mediated by minihepcidin led to a reduction of erythroid
progenitor cells when compared with vehicle (fraction 1 to 4). No
significant changes in mean corpuscular hemoglobin were seen.
We did not observe differences in liver iron content in treated
animals vs controls, but a significant increase in splenic iron levels
was detected at both doses (supplemental Figure 5A). These
findings were confirmed by Perls’ Prussian blue staining in liver
and spleen sections (supplemental Figure 5B), showing increased
iron retention by macrophages.
Prolonged administration of minihepcidin normalizes HCT
levels but can cause iron-restricted erythropoiesis in a mouse
model of PV
To investigate the effect of minihepcidin at similar or higher doses
and for longer periods, we performed studies using M009 at a dose
range of 10 to 20 mg/kg administered by twice-weekly SC
injections for 6 weeks. At the end of the treatment period, we
observed decreased HCT levels (Figure 6A) due to a large
reduction in erythrocytosis in M009-treated animals. Circulating Hb
concentrations and RBC numbers (Figure 6B-C) were also reduced in a
dose-dependent fashionto the same or lower level than seen in healthy
untreated WT littermates. However, we also observed a dose-
dependent development of iron-restricted erythropoiesis by spleno-
megaly (Figure 6D) and expansion of early erythroid progenitors by
flowcytometrystudies(Figure 6E).Theseobservationsindicatethatin
PV minihepcidin administration needs to be titrated to reduce
erythrocytosis while minimizing the negative effects of erythrocyte
iron deficiency. As seen in animals treated for 3 weeks, administra-
tion of minihepcidin led to increased iron deposition in splenic
macrophages, while no major changes were observed in liver sections
(Figure 6F).
Discussion
In b-thalassemia and anemia, increased EPO levels and expanded
but ineffective erythropoiesis result in lowered hepcidin levels,
increased intestinal iron absorption, and TSAT.3,6,8,21,27 In turn,
excess iron contributes to the development and worsening of
ineffective erythropoiesis and reduced erythroblast maturation.1
Here, we show that minihepcidins can break this maladaptive,
vicious circle and thus establish a new set point for BM
erythropoiesis, ameliorating ineffective erythropoiesis and de-
creasing erythroid cell damage. Remarkably, the RBC count and
lifespan are restored to those observed in WT mice. We surmise
that the corrective effect begins with a reduction in hemichrome
and ROS formation, leading to subsequent amelioration of ery-
throid damage and increased effective erythropoiesis. We expect
that in a clinical setting, these biological effects may result in
other beneficial changes not explored in our mouse model. For
instance, improved RBC morphology may reduce stickiness,
peripheral RBC destruction, and thrombotic risk. Decreased spleen
size could reduce the need for surgical splenectomy. An improvement
in anemia reduces hypoxia, which, together with decreased
destruction of RBCs, may prevent or delay lethal complications
such as pulmonary hypertension. Preventing iron accumulation
addresses a critical mechanism of the disease and should avoid or
delay the development of cirrhosis and liver cancer.
Here, we also conducted studies in the Hbbth3/1 mouse to evaluate
whethertheconcurrentuseoftheoralironchelatorDFPandminihepcidin
would lead to therapeutic interaction. Our data show that minihepcidin
and DFP retain their positive effects on erythropoiesis and iron over-
load. Based on these observations, we anticipate that in untransfused
b-thalassemic patients with moderate or severe iron overload,
treatment with minihepcidin could improve erythropoiesis, whereas
oral chelation therapy would still be beneficial in reversing established
iron overload.
Interestingly, chelation alone failed to cause iron restriction
or improve hematological parameters, as also seen in previous
studies.2,28 In DFP-treated mice, despite a decrease in liver iron
concentration, TSAT and serum iron levels were not decreased.
However, when DFP was combined with minihepcidin, we ob-
served the same beneficial effects on ineffective erythropoiesis,
RBC lifespan, and anemia, even though levels of serum iron and
TSAT were not decreased compared with solvent-treated mice.
The potential mechanisms by which this may occur are speculative.
Perhaps as DFP releases iron from the liver, it delivers some iron
to serum transferrin via a shuttling effect. However, when
minihepcidin is administered together with DFP, the overall flow of
iron for erythropoiesis might be reduced, as some iron is diverted
to macrophages (supplemental Figure 6). Additional studies
will be needed to test this model. Nevertheless, the lack of an
impact of concurrent minihepcidin therapy on the tissue iron–
depleting properties of DFP indicates that the 2 modalities may
have additive or synergistic therapeutic effects. In addition, these data
indicate that chelator-induced iron excretion can be accom-
plished despite increased macrophage iron sequestration in
minihepcidin-treated mice. These results also bode well for the
design of clinical trials in which the therapeutic effects of
minihepcidin should be testable without interference with chelator
therapy, the current standard of care. In short-term experiments,
endogenous hepcidin levels were reduced, reaching baseline
levels at 48 to 72 hours (supplemental Figure 3A). This, together
with the fact that endogenous hepcidin levels were not increased
at the end of the 6-week study (supplemental Figure 3C) while
serum Erfe levels were decreased, points to the multiple regu-
lators of hepcidin, where the net effect of decreasing both Erfe
and systemic iron levels resulted in unchanged hepcidin levels.
Altogether these observations document the amelioration of in-
effective erythropoiesis as indicated by a better balance between
immature and mature erythroid cells in the BM and spleen and
more RBCs in circulation but less serum EPO (Figures 2E, 4B,
and 4J).
Our data also indicate that minihepcidin may be benefi-
cial in the treatment of PV by limiting iron availability to
erythroid precursors, thereby inhibiting JAK2-stimulated eryth-
ropoiesis and reducing RBC production. Controlling HCT is of
critical importance in PV management. Here, the ability of
minihepcidin to rapidly impose iron-restricted erythropoiesis
contrasts with intermittent phlebotomy, where the removal of
RBCs is rapidly compensated, at least until enough RBC mass is

Figure 6. Prolonged treatment of PV mice with minihepcidin can cause iron-restricted erythropoiesis. PV mice (Jak2V617F/1 VAV-Cre double transgenic) generated by
BM transplantation (as seen before) start receiving M009 or vehicle by SC injections 4 weeks post-BM transplant (at a dose of 10, 15, or 20 mg/kg) twice a week for 6 weeks.
Hematological parameters such as HCT (A), Hb (B), and RBC (C) were normalized in a dose-dependent fashion. However, this prolonged treatment was also associated with
the development of iron-restricted erythropoiesis. This was indicated by increased splenomegaly (D) and erythroid maturation block shown by flow cytometry studies (E).
Prussian blue staining on liver and spleen sections highlights increased iron deposition in the spleen, but not changes in liver iron content (F). Images were captured using a
Leica DM4000B upright scope paired with a Spot RT/SE Slider camera (103/numerical aperture 0.40 objective) and then acquired using the Spot 5.1 software. Results
represent mean 6 SD; ****P , .0001, ***P , .001, **P , .01, and *P , .05. Analysis was performed using one-way ANOVA with Tukey multiple comparison adjustment.

From 
 removed to cause iron deficiency. These results suggest that
minihepcidin therapy could be used as a “medical phlebotomy”
to provide continuous control of accelerated erythropoiesis in
the treatment of PV. Because of the association between high
HCT levels and poor outcomes, the rapid and continuous
control of HCT levels using minihepcidin could be highly
clinically meaningful if clinical trials show that it can be done
safely.
In conclusion, the drug-like minihepcidin peptides offer a
new potential pharmacotherapeutic approach to achieve thera-
peutic iron restriction in the treatment of b-thalassemia, PV, and
perhaps other less common disorders associated with abnormal
erythropoiesis.
