ABSTRACT
Background and Aims
One of the challenges of international alcohol research and policy is the variability in and lack of
knowledge of how governments in different nations define a standard drink and low-risk drinking. This study gathered
such information from governmental agencies in 37 countries. Methods
A pool of 75 countries that might have defini-
tions was created using World Health Organization (WHO) information and the authors’ own judgement. Structured
internet searches of relevant terms for each country were supplemented by efforts to contact government agencies directly
and to consult with alcohol experts in the country. Results
Most of the 75 national governments examined were not
identified as having adopted a standard drink definition. Among the 37 that were so identified, the modal standard drink
size was 10 g pure ethanol, but variation was wide (8–20 g). Significant variability was also evident for low-risk drinking
guidelines, ranging from 10–42 g per day for women and 10–56 g per day for men to 98–140 g per week for women and
150–280 g per week for men. Conclusions
Researchers working and communicating across national boundaries should
be sensitive to the substantial variability in ‘standard’ drink definitions and low-risk drinking guidelines. The potential im-
pact of guidelines, both in general and in specific national cases, remains an important question for public health research.

INTRODUCTION
The adverse impacts of heavy alcohol consumption on
population health have led some governments to adopt
guidelines that define a standard drink and low-risk drink-
ing [1]. The World Health Organization (WHO) guideline
regarding brief intervention for risky drinking defines a
standard drink as 10 g of pure ethanol, with both men
and women advised not to exceed two standard drinks
per day [2]. It is not currently clear how widely a 10 g
definition has been adopted internationally nor, indeed,
whether most governments adopt any standard at all. Fur-
ther, consumers of guidelines and users of ‘standardized’
terms such as ‘drink’ may not be aware that standards vary
from country to country, such that research findings and
health recommendations may be miscommunicated. To
inform the international alcohol research, clinical and
public health communities more clearly, the present study
gathered
information
systematically on
government-
produced guidelines around the world.
METHODS
We focused upon governmental guidelines. We avoided
those generated by drinks industry sources and by non-
governmental organizations (some of which may been
supported in some way by the drinks industry). The period
of data collection was May–August 2015.
Our initial pool of 51 countries to examine came from a
2012 WHO list of countries that had reportedly defined a
standard drink [3]. We supplemented those countries with
24 others that in the authors’ judgement might possibly
have defined a drink since 2012 or been missed in the
WHO’s accounting.
Initially, we used an internet Google search with the
string, ‘[country] AND standard drink’. We were often then
able to navigate directly to the governmental health or
nutrition agency that promulgated the definition of a
standard drink and low-risk alcohol consumption guide-
lines. We also identified the websites of countries’ health
ministries using either an internet search: ‘[country]

 AND health ministry’, or using the following two sources:
the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United
Nations [4] and the International Society for Pharma-
coeconomics and Outcomes Research [5]. If an option for
an English version of the website was available, we selected
that option and then performed a search of the website for
‘alcohol’.
The authors of this paper are able to read English, Polish
and Spanish. In cases where we were unable to understand
a language, we requested the help of professional
colleagues (usually, but not always, based in the country
in question) who were fluent in other languages (e.g.
French, German, Italian, Mandarin, Portuguese and Viet-
namese). Once our professional colleague was able to iden-
tify the guidelines on a specific web-page, we used Google
translate in order to confirm those guidelines in English.
If we were unable to identify guidelines for the particu-
lar country, we e-mailed that country’s health ministry
using the contact information available on the website
and requested information about the standard drink
measure and the low-risk consumption guidelines. Again,
in cases where the source information was only available
in the native language, Google translate was used to
confirm the guidelines in English.
RESULTS
Our methods did not locate any standard drink definitions
for 15 countries that were listed on the WHO website [3]:
Albania, Belize, Cuba, Czech Republic, Equatorial Guinea,
Finland, Jamaica, Kiribati, Mongolia, Niue, Saint Kitts
and Nevis, Senegal, Serbia, Turkey and Zimbabwe. This
does not confirm that these nations lack standard drink def-
initions and guidelines, only that we did not find them and
received no response from health officials. In contrast, we
received specific confirmation from health officials in four
other countries on the WHO list that their nations had
not, in fact, created a standard drink definition and guide-
lines: Israel* Lesotho*, the Netherlands* and Norway*.
Of the 24 additional countries not on the WHO list, our
methods identified standardized drink definitions/safe
drinking guidelines for five: China*, Grenada [6], Iceland
[7], Japan [8] and Mexico [9]. In total, we thus found infor-
mation for 37 countries (See Table 1).
The data from several countries merit elaboration.
Austria [10] has a domestic standard drink size of 20 g,
which is reported in Table 1, but the health ministry’s
educational materials also present parallel low-risk drink-
ing guidelines assuming a smaller drink definition that is
more similar to that in other countries (8 g). South Africa’s
government [11] disseminates recommendations on the
number of glasses of beer and wine per day, but does not
provide standard measures of these drinks [11]. Malta*
and Malaysia* define a standard drink but do not have
specific low-risk consumption guidelines, whereas Japan
has low-risk consumption guidelines in grams of pure
ethanol but does not define a standard drink [8]. The US
government [12], rather confusingly, has guidelines for
low-risk drinking which are reproduced in Table 1, yet also
has a separate, lower guideline for ‘moderate drinking’
(up to 14 g a day for women and 28 g a day for men).
The data reveal many national differences. First, some
countries define a standard drink more approximately than
others (e.g. in Switzerland [13], it is 10–12 g whereas in
Luxembourg [14] it is precisely 12.8 g). Secondly, although
the WHO suggested that a standard drink size of 10 g of
pure ethanol is clearly the modal definition in use around
the world, only half of countries use it specifically or pres-
ent a ranged definition that includes it. At the extremes,
the size of a standard drink varies by 250% (from a low
of 8 g to a high of 20 g). Thirdly, four of the 37 countries
(Australia [15], Grenada [6], Portugal* and South Africa
[11]) do not provide separate low-risk drinking guidelines
for men and women.
In gathering the information in Table 1, we noted some
other features of low-risk drinking guidelines that we did
not specifically search for. Almost all countries with
standard drink definitions (and, indeed, some without
any, such as Belize, Trinidad and Tobago) recommend
abstinence from alcohol during pregnancy and/or during
breastfeeding. Some countries specify a higher drink limit
for ‘special occasions’ (e.g. Australia [15], Canada [16],
Denmark [17], Fiji [18], France [19], Mexico [9], New
Zealand [20], Poland [21], the United Kingdom [22]) and
many guidelines recommend abstinence from alcohol for
1–3 days per week; examples include Canada [16], Chile
[23], Estonia*, Germany [24] and New Zealand [25].
DISCUSSION
In this report, our aim was to provide a systematically gen-
erated compilation of the standard drink measures and
low-risk consumption guidelines for all the countries in
the world that disseminate governmental guidelines. We
note as a caution that we did not study the structure of
government decision-making comprehensively in the
nations that responded and thus could not distinguish
whether the guidelines reported here were adopted
through a truly national governmental approval process,
or were simply promulgated by a single agency with stand-
ing in the field (e.g. a federal health ministry). We were also
limited by reliance upon internet searches, e-mails to
health ministries and our network of contacts in other
countries. As more of the world gains access to the
internet, access to a larger number of the world’s health
ministries should become available.
Drinking guidelines are not set in stone, and what is
summarized in this paper should be considered within

 the context of the data collection period (the summer of
2015). In January 2016, the UK Department of Health
proposed new drinking guidelines that replace a daily
consumption guideline with a weekly recommended
limit of 112 g of ethanol for both males and females
[47]. The newly proposed guidelines, upon which the
government is now taking consultation, represents a sig-
nificant change and other nations, of course, may also
alter their guidelines some day in response to different
scientific and policy forces. We therefore intend to up-
date this report in the future and would be grateful to
international colleagues who inform us of developments
in their countries regarding standard drink definitions
and drinking guidelines.
The data from 37 countries that we were able to gather
suggest that caution should be exercised when attempting
to translate alcohol findings across national borders
(e.g. when reading a study of ‘low-risk drinking’ published
in a country other than one’s own). Although the 10 g of
pure ethanol per standard drink definition is prevalent,
assuming its universality would be an error as often as it
would be correct. This variation is not entirely surprising,
given differences in culture-specific traditions of measure-
ment (e.g. the United Kingdom’s reliance upon imperial
Table 1 Governmental standard drink definitions and low-risk consumption guidelines in grams of pure ethanol.

 measures, the United States not having the metric system)
and drinking practices. Indeed, in those countries where
the most widely consumed drinks contain an amount of
ethanol other than 10 g [26] it may be more sensible for
public health officials to match the national standard drink
definition to prevalent drinking practices rather than
attempt to teach the public an alien system (e.g. ‘The drink
you consider standard shall henceforth be known as 1.6
standard drinks instead’).
In reviewing the results there is a striking discrepancy
in guidelines for low-risk consumption, ranging from
10 g per day (Bosnia and Herzegovina [27], Croatia*, India
[28], Portugal*, Slovenia [29] and Sweden [30]) to 56 g per
day (Chile [23]). It is also notable that countries disagree as
to whether low-risk drinking has the same definition for
men and women. Differences in how countries define
low-risk consumption in general and for different popula-
tion groups may stem from reliance upon diverse data
sources regarding alcohol-related harm. For example, pub-
lic health officials and scientists in different countries may
rely upon studies performed in different populations (e.g.
in the general population versus in clinical samples), in dif-
ferent populations (e.g. in samples of men versus women,
young people versus older adults) and in different social
contexts (e.g. in cultures where drinking by women is or
is not stigmatized more than drinking by men). That said,
given the wide disparity in definitions of low-risk drinking
around the world, it seems unlikely that everyone is
correct. Indeed, one cannot even rule out the possibility
that all 37 countries examined are in some sense wrong,
in so far as there is no robust evidence that the general
population changes its level of alcohol consumption in
response to governments defining standard drinks and
publishing low-risk drinking guidelines. Comparing the
potential health impact of different nations’ guidelines
would be a worthy activity for international research
teams.
In conclusion, most national governments do not define
a standard drink and low-risk drinking. We hope our
compilation inspires more evaluation of whether such
guidelines benefit public health and, if so, what strategies
would increase the number of nations that develop and
disseminate them.
