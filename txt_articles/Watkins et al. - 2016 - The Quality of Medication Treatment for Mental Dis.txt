Objective: The quality of mental health care provided by the
U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) was compared with
care provided to a comparable population treated in the
private sector.
Methods: Two cohorts of individuals with mental disorders
(schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, posttraumatic stress disor-
der, major depression, and substance use disorders) were
created with VA administrative data (N=836,519) and
MarketScan data (N=545,484). The authors computed VA
and MarketScan national means for seven process-based
quality measures related to medication evaluation and
management and estimated national-level performance by
age and gender.
Results: In every case, VA performance was superior to that
of the private sector by more than 30%. Compared with in-
dividuals in private plans, veterans with schizophrenia or
major depression were more than twice as likely to receive
appropriate initial medication treatment, and veterans with
depression were more than twice as likely to receive ap-
propriate long-term treatment.
Conclusions: Findings demonstrate the significant advan-
tages that accrue from an organized, nationwide system of
care. The much higher performance of the VA has important
clinical and policy implications.

The quality of health care provided by the U.S. Department
of Veterans Affairs (VA) has been the subject of controversy.
Some reports suggest that the quality of care is as good as or
better than the private sector or Medicare, whereas others
suggest that VA care is characterized by “unchecked in-
competence” (1–4). No recent studies have compared the
quality of outpatient care provided to veterans with mental
disorders with the care provided to a comparable population
treated in the private sector across multiple mental health
diagnoses, although one study published in 2000 examined
the quality of inpatient care episodes from 1993 to 1997 and
found that during that time VA care improved “markedly”
compared with the private sector (5). The lack of research is
important, because many individuals with mental disorders
have complex conditions that are costly to care for (whether
in the VA or private sector); because mental health condi-
tions are among the principal sources of disability in the
veteran population and use of appropriate care processes has
important consequences for outcomes of these conditions;
and because comparison of the quality of care processes
across systems can provide important insight into the ef-
fectiveness of alternative approaches to the organization,
financing, and management of services for this large and
growing population and inform efforts to improve care
processes.
U.S. veterans are a vulnerable population, with higher
rates of serious mental disorders than found in the civilian
population (6). Among veterans of the Afghanistan and Iraq
conflicts, prolonged and repeated deployments have mag-
nified these problems (7). The prevalence of mental health
problems, especially posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD),
is also high among veterans of earlier conflicts. Meeting the
health care needs of this vulnerable population is the re-
sponsibility of the VA, which has the nation’s largest in-
tegrated health care system. In recent years, the VA has
made improving mental health care for veterans an insti-
tutional priority.
In 2006, the VA Office of Policy and Planning contracted
with Altarum Institute and the RAND Corporation to conduct
a formal, independent evaluation of the quality of VA mental
health and substance use care. The evaluation focused on
veterans who had a diagnosis of one of five conditions:
schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, PTSD, major depressive
disorder, and substance use disorders—conditions that are the
most prevalent in this population, are associated with high
levels of disability, and are costly to treat. Results of this

 comprehensive evaluation have been reported elsewhere (8).
In the study reported here, we compared the quality of VA
care to that received by comparable individuals in the
private sector, in an analysis conducted in collaboration
with a team of researchers at Rutgers University.
Watkins and colleagues (8) described the VA’s perfor-
mance measured against its own institutional goals and
standards and in terms of improvements over time in pro-
viding access to services and evidence-based care. Another
way to evaluate quality is to calibrate results by placing
them in a broader context. Using administrative data, we
used selected quality indicators to assess the performance of
the VA and the performance of private-sector plans for a
large, commercially insured population. We conducted the
private-plan analysis in partnership with researchers at the
Rutgers University Center for Education and Research on
Therapeutics.
METHODS
Data Sources
The research team used administrative data on utilization
from the VA National Patient Care Database, which includes
patient treatment files of all VA inpatient treatment dis-
charges and outpatient care files. Laboratory and pharmacy
data were obtained from the National Data Extract files.
Administrative data, from the Central Fee data sets, also
included care delivered by non-VA providers but paid for by
the VA. The private-plan cohort was a sample
of privately insured individuals developed by
using administrative claims data from the
Thomson-Reuters MarketScan Commercial
Claims and Encounter Database (9). The data-
base describes health care utilization of non-
Medicare active employees, early retirees,
individuals receiving COBRA benefits, and their
dependents insured by more than 150 employer-
sponsored health insurance plans and enrolled
inmorethan100healthplans.Pharmacyandlabo-
ratory claims are included in the database, even
for beneficiaries covered through a capitated
behavioral health carve out.
Defining Study Cohorts
The analysis used two study populations. The
veteran cohort consisted of all veterans under
age 65 who in fiscal year (FY) 2007 had at
least one inpatient episode with a qualifying
primary or secondary diagnosis or two out-
patient encounters, at least one of which was
for a qualifying primary or secondary di-
agnosis. Qualifying diagnoses included 43
diagnoses associated with schizophrenia, bi-
polar I disorder, PTSD, major depression, and
substance use disorders. Each veteran was
assigned to only one mental disorder di-
agnostic cohort on the basis of the modal frequency of ap-
pearance of diagnosis codes in the veteran’s medical utilization
files, except when veterans had both a mental and a substance
use disorder diagnosis. In those instances, veterans were also
placed into the substance use disorder cohort in any fiscal year
if their utilization records contained ICD-9-CM diagnosis
codes for a substance use disorder.
The same methodology used to define the veteran cohort
was used to define the private-plan cohort. We excluded
individuals age 65 and older because MarketScan data do not
include Medicare claims data; incomplete data for seniors
would reduce the reliability and validity of the claims-based
performance indicators and decrease the generalizability of
the comparison of VA and private plans for these individuals.
We also excluded from the MarketScan data any care pro-
vided to children under age 18, because this age group is not
represented among veterans. To the extent possible, we used
MarketScan data from the same period used for the VA
analysis—FY 2007, with a follow-up period extending into
2008. However, the MarketScan data were available only for
the first half of FY 2008; thus for two indicators (mainte-
nance treatment with antipsychotics or mood stabilizers),
the MarketScan data included only individuals who filled
prescriptions for related medications in the first half of FY
2007 to allow for the full 12 months of follow-up to de-
termine whether the numerator criteria were met for the
indicator. The VA data reflected the veteran population for
all who were eligible for the measure in FY 2007.

QUALITY OF MEDICATION TREATMENT IN THE VA AND IN PRIVATE-SECTOR PLANS
 Selecting Performance Indicators
We selected seven performance indicators for the compar-
ison with private plans from the set of administrative data
indicators used in the VA evaluation (8,10) that could be
operationalized by using a database of paid insurance claims.
The indicators, shown in Table 1, reflect VA clinical practice
guidelines or are standard best practices. To make the in-
dicators comparable, we mapped VA pharmacy and labora-
tory codes to National Drug Codes and Current Procedure
Terminology codes and excluded inpatient medications
from the VA data to match the level of information available
in the MarketScan data.
Analysis
We computed VA and MarketScan national means for each
performance indicator and estimated national-level perfor-
mance by age and gender. Apart from age and gender, we
were unable to risk adjust for differences that exist between
the two systems. We note, however, that unlike outcomes,
which are strongly related to initial illness severity, the
provision of services is largely under the control of pro-
viders. All our performance indicators measure processes of
care for individuals for whom such care is recommended.
RESULTS
Comparability of the Study Cohorts
Table 2 presents basic demographic and diagnostic in-
formation for the VA and MarketScan cohorts. The VA di-
agnostic cohorts were systematically more likely to be male
and older than the privately insured cohorts drawn from the
MarketScan data. For example, for major depressive disor-
der, 83% of the VA cohort was male, and 43% of individuals
were age 55 to 64; in the privately insured cohort, the
comparable percentages were 30% and 22%, respectively.
Quality of Care
We computed the VA national average and the MarketScan
average for each indicator, and we report both overall results
and results by gender, summarized in Table 3. [Figures
presenting results of each comparison by age and gender are
included in an online supplement to this article.] The pro-
portions for each indicator when stratified by age or gender
were similar to the respective national average.
VA performance was superior to the MarketScan national
average by more than 30% in every case. In some cases, the
margin of superiority was very large. For example, the rate at
which the medication lab tests indicator was met in the VA
(77%) was 13 times the rate at which it was met in the private
plans (6%). This measure applies to veterans who received
antipsychotic medications, lithium, valproic acid, or carba-
mazepine and reflects the proportion of these patients who
received all recommended blood level–monitoring tests
during the study period. Compared with individuals in pri-
vate plans, veterans with schizophrenia or major depression
were more than twice as likely to receive appropriate initial
medication treatment, and veterans with depression were
more than twice as likely to receive appropriate long-term
treatment.
DISCUSSION
We found that the quality of care provided by the VA to
veterans with mental and substance use disorders consis-
tently exceeded the quality of care provided by the private
sector for the performance indicators examined, sometimes
by large margins. The findings presented here are consistent
with prior reports that VA performance consistently exceeds
that of non-VA comparison groups for process-based quality
measures (2,11).

WATKINS ET AL.
 It is likely that the superior performance observed in the
VA system is in part the result of the additional structures
that the VA has put in place to support and encourage high-
quality care. These structures influence both the provider’s
ability to deliver care and the patient’s ability to access and
adhere to recommended treatment. For example, the colo-
cation of pharmacy and laboratory services near specialty
and primary care clinics facilitates patient access to these
services, and the integrated electronic medical record means
that all providers can instantly review and address patient
laboratory results. Colocation of laboratory services may be
particularly important for monitoring metabolic parameters
among patients receiving medications that can have signifi-
cant metabolic impact, as reflected in the VA’s superior
performance in this area. VA providers also have access to
decision support tools, and the electronic medical record
supports best practices through automated clinical re-
minders. Network leadership provides systematic oversight
of performance, and the salary model of care provides more
flexibility in how resources and personnel are organized.
Finally, best practices are encouraged through the dissemi-
nation of clinical practice guidelines, performance metrics,
and financial performance incentives for network leaders.
Some of the differences may have stemmed from differ-
ences in patient populations. For example, the VA cohort
was older, and it is established in the literature that medi-
cation adherence (which influences five of these measures)
is positively correlated with age. However, VA performance
was superior within each age category, suggesting that
population differences were not a primary reason for the
observed differences.
Our results are unlikely to be affected by missing in-
formation on dual coverage by Medicare for some individ-
uals in the private-plan population. Because the MarketScan
data set we used is derived from an employed population, it
should contain very few individuals covered by Medicare in
addition to their private insurance, because only dependents
are eligible for additional coverage by Medicare. We note
that because the private plan is the first payer for the services
received by such dependents (12), the service and pharmacy
use measures based on MarketScan should be valid and
should not be biased downward because of dual enrollment
in Medicare.
Our findings indicate much lower rates of both acute and
maintenance antidepressant treatment than rates reported
by Busch and colleagues (11), who compared the quality of
VA and private-sector treatment in 2000 by using Market-
Scan data. In their study, 84.7% of VA patients versus 81% of
MarketScan patients received appropriate antidepressant
treatment for an acute episode, and 53.9% versus 50.9%,
respectively, received appropriate continuation phase
treatment. Our differing results are likely attributable to the
different way our cohorts were constructed and the indi-
cators defined and underline how even small variations in
the ways that an indicator and eligible population are
operationalized can have a substantial impact on results.
Busch and colleagues required only one outpatient visit with
a diagnosis of major depression, rather than two visits, and
included individuals who may have had an additional modal
diagnosis of bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, or PTSD.
Our analysis had several limitations. First, the number of
indicators compared was relatively small; thus the results
may not be generalizable to the care delivered for these
conditions more broadly. Second, we do not know the extent
of missing data. For example, medication data may have been
missing because individuals were paying out of pocket for
medications. Although some of the private-plan individuals
were covered under behavioral health carve-out arrange-
ments, laboratory and pharmacy claims are typically not
included in the carve out and so should have been present in
our data. However, data about laboratory tests may have
been missing if the laboratory or physician received bundled
or capitated payments for medical care on a per episode or
per patient basis, which does not encourage filing of claims
for individual tests. This may be more of a problem in private
plans than in the VA and may explain some of the observed
difference. We do not know the extent of bundled or capi-
tated payments.
Third, the privately insured individuals did not have
uniform coverage and benefit levels. The MarketScan data
represent many different types of health plans, including
fee-for-service, fully capitated, and partially capitated ar-
rangements, and we did not have information on the gen-
erosity of coverage provided by different plans. Access to
specialty care, particularly mental health services, probably
varied from plan to plan, because those services may be

 carved out to behavioral health services companies, with
varying screening and preauthorization algorithms.
However, because the contributors to the MarketScan
databases tend to be large employers, it is likely that the
health care coverage provided is more comprehensive than
among the privately insured population in general, sug-
gesting that lack of coverage was not the reason for differ-
ences in performance. Differences in out-of-pocket expenses
for services (for example, copayments) may also have been
larger in private insurance plans than in the VA.
Finally, the two study populations may have differed on
dimensions that we could not observe and measure. Apart
from age and gender, we were unable to risk adjust for un-
measured differences. Although we present national-level
estimates of performance by age and gender, there may be
other systematic differences between the cohorts—for ex-
ample, in race-ethnicity, socioeconomic status, or general
medical or mental health status—that would be useful in
understanding performance results and that could not be
included, because administrative data, to which the
MarketScan database is limited, do not contain this in-
formation. To the extent differences existed in socioeco-
nomic and general medical or mental health status, the
veteran population was likely to be more economically dis-
advantaged and sicker.
The direction of any bias related to the chronicity and
severity of mental disorders is unclear. Because of the stigma
associated with a psychiatric diagnosis, providers may re-
cord a psychiatric diagnosis only for the sickest individuals.
It is also possible that the VA may be more likely than private
plans to identify mental disorders at lower levels of severity
because of the VA’s extensive screening procedures, par-
ticularly for depression. There may have been differences in
diagnostic coding practices between VA and private pro-
viders, and it is possible that the severity of mental disorders
may have been confounded with willingness to take medi-
cations on a long-term basis. Finally, we had no information
on medication possession ratios and were unable to de-
finitively show that paid claims in the MarketScan data were
equivalent to prescriptions filled in the VA.
CONCLUSIONS
These findings have important clinical and policy implica-
tions. Among veterans who received a new diagnosis of de-
pression, suicide attempt rates have been found to be lower
among patients who were appropriately treated with anti-
depressants than among those who were not (13,14). Among
individuals with bipolar disorder, maintenance treatment
with mood-stabilizing drugs was found to be associated with
a decreased rate of completed suicide, compared with brief
or interrupted treatment with these medications, and the
rate of suicide decreased consistently with the number of
additional prescriptions (15). Consistent use of antipsychotic
and mood-stabilizing medication for individuals with either
schizophrenia or bipolar disorder has been found to be
associated with lower rates of relapse and hospitalization
(16). Laboratory monitoring is essential for the safe and
effective use of second-generation antipsychotics. Clinical
guidelines, such as the American Psychiatric Association–
American Diabetes Association guidelines, call for glucose
and lipid testing for all patients starting to receive second-
generation antipsychotic medication, but these guidelines
and U.S. Food and Drug Administration warnings have had
only limited impact on testing rates in general treatment
populations. The much higher performance of the VA on
these measures has important implications for the safe
management of these powerful medications that can have a
significant impact on clinical outcomes.
