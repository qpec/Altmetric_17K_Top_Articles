Abstract
Background
Overtreatment is a cause of preventable harm and waste in health care. Little is known
about clinician perspectives on the problem. In this study, physicians were surveyed on the
prevalence, causes, and implications of overtreatment.
Methods
2,106 physicians from an online community composed of doctors from the American Medi-
cal Association (AMA) masterfile participated in a survey. The survey inquired about the
extent of overutilization, as well as causes, solutions, and implications for health care. Main
outcome measures included: percentage of unnecessary medical care, most commonly
cited reasons of overtreatment, potential solutions, and responses regarding association of
profit and overtreatment.
Findings
The response rate was 70.1%. Physicians reported that an interpolated median of 20.6% of
overall medical care was unnecessary, including 22.0% of prescription medications, 24.9% of
tests, and 11.1% of procedures. The most common cited reasons for overtreatment were fear
of malpractice (84.7%), patient pressure/request (59.0%), and difficulty accessing medical
records (38.2%). Potential solutions identified were training residents on appropriateness cri-
teria (55.2%), easy access to outside health records (52.0%), and more practice guidelines
(51.5%). Most respondents (70.8%) believed that physicians are more likely to perform unnec-
essary procedures when they profit from them. Most respondents believed that de-emphasiz-
ing fee-for-service physician compensation would reduce health care utilization and costs.
Conclusion
From the physician perspective, overtreatment is common. Efforts to address the problem
should consider the causes and solutions offered by physicians.

 Introduction
Waste in health care is increasingly being recognized as a cause of patient harm and excess
costs. In 2010, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) called attention to the problem, suggesting that
“unnecessary services” are the largest contributor to waste in United States (US) health care,
accounting for approximately $210 billion of the estimated $750 billion in excess spending
each year.[1] The report estimated the cost using four analytically distinct studies, including
two projections of excess spending associated with variation in care.[2, 3] In previous studies
of specialty care, it has been observed that 30% of inpatient antimicrobial therapy,[4] 26% of
advanced imaging,[5] and 12% of acute percutaneous coronary interventions are unnecessary
or inappropriate.[6] Reducing overtreatment has important implications for improving
patient-centered care.[7] Overtreatment is directly associated with patient harm as evidenced
by studies of antibiotic overuse leading to resistance and Clostridium difficile infection,[8]
overuse of diagnostic testing, such as pap smear and colonoscopy,[9, 10] and the inherent post-
operative complications from unnecessary surgical procedures.[11]
To date, however, direct estimates by physicians of the prevalence of unnecessary care have
been limited. There was one survey study conducted in 2009 by Sirovich et al that studied pri-
mary care physician perceptions on overall utilization of health care resources.[12] Clinical
appropriateness remains difficult to measure, and studies relying on large datasets or chart
review rarely capture pivotal details of a patient’s clinical presentation and are subject to
reporting bias. Furthermore, thresholds to intervene medically can be soft and influenced by a
lack of awareness about best practices or by perverse financial incentives, which have been
implicated as a contributor to unnecessary care.[13, 14] Physicians have a unique front-line
perspective on the problem of overtreatment given their direct role in recommending, manag-
ing, and observing tests, procedures, and medications. To draw on this knowledge, we
designed a study to estimate physicians’ perspective on the prevalence of overtreatment in
health care and identify potential causes and solutions.
Materials and methods
All medical doctors listed in the American Medical Association (AMA) master file were previ-
ously invited on an annual basis to participate in an online educational community (Quan-
tiaMD) which includes 160,000 U.S. physicians, representing 28% of U.S. physicians.
Members of this community were invited by email between January 22, 2014 and March 8,
2014 to complete a survey about physician practice patterns. Participation was voluntary, and
each participant was paid a $5 gift voucher for completing the survey. Financial resources to
provide thank you gift cards to doctors who completed the survey determined how many were
invited. We randomly selected 3,318 doctors from the educational community of 160,000 doc-
tors and 2,327 clinicians completed the survey, for a 70.1% survey response rate. We excluded
213 clinicians who we identified to be midlevel clinicians and 8 physician respondents who
did not complete the last three questions, yielding a final study population of 2,106 physicians.
Mid-level providers included physician assistants and nurse practitioners; they were excluded
for the purposes of keeping the survey respondents a uniform population of physicians. After
excluding midlevel providers and 8 respondents that did not complete the survey, we had a
final study population representing 63.5% of invitees. General Internal Medicine, Pediatrics,
and Family Medicine were considered primary care, while all other specialties were considered
specialist care. Specialized Internal Medicine specialties included Allergy and Immunology,
Cardiology, Endocrinology, Gastroenterology, Geriatrics, Hematology and Oncology, Infec-
tious Disease, Interventional Cardiology, Nephrology, Pulmonary and Critical Care, Rheuma-
tology, and Sleep Medicine. The distribution of physicians by specialty in the study population

 (Table 1) relative to the distribution of physicians in the U.S. was skewed toward primary care
but still included a high number of specialists (57.6% vs. 33.4% primary care, 42.4% vs. 66.6%
specialists, respectively).[15]
The survey queried physician attitudes on overtreatment, and the causes and solutions for the
problem. The survey was piloted to six focus groups over a 9-month period prior to the study
period. Focus groups were qualitative, asking physicians 3 questions after completing the survey:
1) “Was any question unclear?” 2) “Did you have to re-read any questions and why?” and 3) “Did
you perceive lead bias in any question, and if so please explain?” A total of 20 physicians partici-
pated in the focus groups. The survey was also distributed at a continuing education national
conference on topics in clinical medicine with a total of 108 respondents, 11 of whom were asked
the same 3 feedback questions. The survey was revised after each focus group. The study was
approved by the Johns Hopkins Medicine Institutional Review Board (#NA_00079329).
Extent of overtreatment
We asked “In your specialty, what percent of overall care do you think is unnecessary?” as well
as follow up questions regarding different classes of interventions, including prescription med-
ications, tests, and procedures. Tests were defined as diagnostic, laboratory, and radiographic.

 Reasons for overtreatment
We asked, “Nationally, what do you think are the top reasons for overutilization of resources,
if any?” and “In your opinion, what can decrease overutilization?” Focusing on fee-for-service
bonus pay to physicians, we asked “What do you think is the percentage of physicians who per-
form unnecessary procedures when they profit from them?” We also asked, “If physician com-
pensation were to change to de-emphasize fee-for-service bonus pay, what do you think would
be the impact on utilization and national health care costs?” in separate questions.
Statistical methods
Physician perceptions on overtreatment, causes, and solutions are presented as descriptive sta-
tistics. Respondents identified percentage ranges of overutilization. Tabulated ranges are
reported both as raw data and, to describe a summary response for the study population, as
median responses. Median responses were estimated using spline interpolation from plots of
percentage of respondents citing increasing ranges of percent overtreatment on the x axis and
cumulative percentage of respondents on the y axis.[16] The chi-square test was used to com-
pare responses on the extent of overtreatment by type of intervention. Associations between
survey responses and respondent characteristics were studied using multivariate logistic and
ordinal logistic regression models. Statistical analyses were performed using STATA/MP soft-
ware, version 12 (StataCorp, College Station, TX).
Results
Of the respondents, 47.9% (1,009/2,106) were attending physicians, of whom 46.0% had at
least 10 years of experience (Table 1). Specialists made up 42.4% of the overall sample; the
most common specialties were General Internal Medicine (40.9%), specialized Internal Medi-
cine (10.8%), and Family Medicine (10.0%). Similarly, in 2010, the specialty with the largest
numbers of active physicians in the U.S. was primary care (internal medicine and family medi-
cine/general practice).[17, 18] Most respondents worked in hospitals that were non-profit
(66.6%), academic (74.3%), and urban (67.6%).
The interpolated median response for the percentage of care delivered that is unnecessary
was 20.6% for overall medical care, 22.0% for prescription medications, 24.9% for tests, and
11.1% for procedures (Fig 1A and 1B). Twenty-seven percent of respondents believed that at
least 30–45% of overall medical care is unnecessary; 4.6% of respondents believed that none of
the medical care delivered is unnecessary. Thirty percent believed that at least 30–45% of pre-
scription medications are unnecessary, 37.7% believed that at least 30–45% of tests are unnec-
essary, and 16.2% believed that at least 30–45% of procedures are unnecessary. Eighteen
percent believed that no procedures are unnecessary. Respondents believed that more tests
and fewer procedures are unnecessary compared to overall medical care (p<0.001).
The top three cited reasons for overtreatment were “fear of malpractice” (84.7%), “patient
pressure/request” (59.0%), and “difficulty accessing prior medical records” (38.2%) (Table 2).
Seventy-one percent of respondents believed that physicians are more likely to perform unnec-
essary procedures when they profit from them. The interpolated median response for the per-
centage of physicians who perform unnecessary procedures with a profit motive was 16.7%;
28.1% of respondents believed that at least 30–45% of physicians do so (Fig 2). Respondents
who were attending physicians with at least 10 years of experience (OR 1.89 (1.43–2.50) vs
trainees) and specialists (OR 1.29 (1.06–1.57)) were more likely to believe that physicians per-
form unnecessary procedures when they profit from them (Table 3). Respondents’ compensa-
tion method and hospital characteristics were not associated with differences in perceptions
on the profit motive associated with unnecessary care.

 The top three cited potential solutions were “training residents on appropriateness criteria”
(55.2%), “easy access to outside health records” (52.0%), and “more practice guidelines”
(51.5%) (Table 4). Seventy-six percent of respondents believed that de-emphasizing fee-for-
service bonus pay would reduce unnecessary utilization; 70.8% believed that it would reduce
national healthcare spending, with the median reduction being 10–20% (Table 5).
Discussion
We found that most physicians surveyed (64.7%) believe that at least 15–30% of medical care
is unnecessary, representing a significant opportunity to reduce waste in health care. We also
found that physicians perceive fear of malpractice, patient demands, and difficulty accessing
prior medical records as the most common reasons for overtreatment. To our knowledge, this
is the first study to survey physicians on overtreatment in a range of specialties and on a
nation-wide level. The important study by Sirovich et al only included primary care physicians,
excluding doctors within procedure-heavy specialties that could contribute to overall overutili-
zation within healthcare. Since 2011, there has been one survey study to date that focused on
perceptions of low value care among 189 physicians that supports the use of evidence based

 initiatives such as the Choosing Wisely campaign to help raise awareness of overutilization
among clinicians.[19]
However, there are some important limitations. First, we did not study the issue of under-
treatment, which is another form of poor quality care that may result in unnecessary health
care spending from patient complications. Second, our survey population included a large per-
centage of academic physicians, who may have different views about overtreatment in compar-
ison to their peers. Third, our sample size was not large enough to compare responses across
specific specialties. Fourth, we used interpolated medians to estimate the overall response to
some questions, which may not represent the true average. The alternative of asking respon-
dents to provide an exact percentage, however, may have introduced bias or been a barrier to
survey completion. Fifth, there may be a response bias inherent to any solicitation of doctors
to participate in a survey and overtreatment is not absolutely equivalent to unnecessary medi-
cal care, the latter of which was the subject of the survey questions. We did not single a group
of doctors out, but rather used AMA masterfile listed doctors who responded to an inquiry.
Despite this method, we believe that a notable strength is that the data represent the direct
voice of physicians on a physician-level problem that is under-recognized, yet endemic in
health care. Sixth, the data was collected in 2014 and does not capture the effect of more recent
initiatives and programs that address overutilization. Nevertheless, overtreatment continues to
be a major contributor to excessive healthcare spending and this data remains relevant nation-
ally. Finally, this study was conducted in the United States but overtreatment is a global issue
and continues to be cited in the literature as such. A recent article in the BMJ from London
cites a list of 40 unnecessary interventions chosen by the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges
modeled after the Choosing Wisely Initiative. [20]

 At 85% of respondents, “fear of malpractice” was the top cited reason for overtreatment.
Perceptions on the prevalence of malpractice suits, however, may be greater than the reality of
the problem. Only 2–3% of patients harmed by negligence pursue litigation, of whom about
half receive compensation.[21] Paid claims have declined by nearly 50% in the last decade,[22]
and it has been suggested that honest disclosure and an offer of an apology by the physician
can further mitigate litigation.[21] Despite this trend, in a survey of 627 primary care

 physicians, the top three cited reasons for overtreatment were malpractice concerns (76%),
clinical performance measures (52%), and inadequate time to spend with patients (40%).[12]
On the patient side, the perception that more care is better care is also a factor and can be
fueled by goals to achieve high patient satisfaction scores. Studies indicate that focused patient
education through shared decision making between patients and physicians results in more
conservative care.[23] Patient decision aids have been associated with a 19% lower likelihood
of patients receiving antibiotics for acute bronchitis or an upper respiratory infection and sig-
nificant reductions in elective surgery use.[24,25] Most patients prefer to leave medical deci-
sions to their physician,[26] suggesting that greater attention to shared decision making can be
a powerful tool to reduce overtreatment. Moreover, improved data sharing can reduce the
number of tests, procedures, and patient encounters, though the impact on overuse may be
limited. In a study of California and Florida emergency departments, regional implementation
of electronic health information exchange reduced repeat CT scans by 8.7%, ultrasounds by
9.1%, and chest X-rays by 13.0%.[27] With increased hospital consolidation in recent years,
health systems should make data sharing a priority both within and among health systems.
Complete interoperability of healthcare information nationwide may yield an estimated net
savings of $78 billion a year.[28]
In our survey, most respondents (70.8%) believed that physicians provide unnecessary pro-
cedures when they profit from them. With regards to physician compensation, both the fee-
for-service and flat salary models have been criticized for their potential unintended conse-
quences. Many large healthcare systems, including Kaiser Permanente, Mayo Clinic, Cleveland
Clinic, and MD Anderson Cancer Center have eliminated compensation schemes based on
clinical throughput. On the other hand, some hospitals are moving toward bonuses more
heavily-weighted for clinical volume to increase physician productivity. This view is consistent
with a previous systematic review showing that fee-for-service physician reimbursement is
associated with more primary care visits, referrals to specialists, and diagnostic and curative
services.[29] Profit motives may manifest in other ways. For example, urology practice groups
able to self-refer patients to radiation treatment are 29% more likely to prescribe radiation
than non-self-referring centers.[30] Also, fee-for-service hospital compensation has been
implicated by respondents as a driver of overtreatment. Payers in some areas have introduced
global payment to hospitals. In Florida, payers have begun to reimburse cancer care using bun-
dled payments. Maryland has legislated a new global payment system so that hospitals will
have a financial incentive to reduce health care waste, presumably including overuse.[31]
Research on integrated health systems, such as Geisinger Health System, suggests that hospi-
tal-insurer alignment on health outcomes can result in lower cost care.[32] Further evaluation

 of the impact of these payment schemes on overtreatment can lead to generalizable models of
delivery that reduce patient harm and wasteful spending.
Addressing overtreatment can have a major impact on rising health care costs in the US.
Using the IOM’s estimate of excess costs arising from overtreatment,[1] a 50% reduction in
“unnecessary services” would result in $105 billion in savings each year, or about 4% of total
national healthcare spending. Fragmented and outdated practice guidelines can be problem-
atic and contribute to the problem of overdiagnosis.[33] Also, overdiagnosis can result in
increased screening and unnecessary imaging and procedures. Guidelines should consider
over-treatment consequences rather than simply increasing screening or diagnosing for a par-
ticular patient presentation. In seeking to raise awareness on overtreatment, the American
Board of Internal Medicine launched the Choosing Wisely campaign, which has resulted in
over 60 specialty “Top Five” lists being published.[34] At our own institution, more than 20
resident groups from the Departments of Surgery and Emergency Medicine have implemented
quality improvement projects to address Choosing Wisely goals. A second campaign called
“Improving Wisely” is now addressing overtreatment by identifying physician-endorsed met-
rics of overtreatment in big data and then notifying outlier physicians of their performance in
a confidential, peer-to-peer manner.
Future work should focus on the most high-volume over-utilized tests and procedures by
specialty. Medical school and training should include guidance on the subject of appropriate-
ness before doctors are exposed to the factors identified in this study as factors contributing to
the problem. Health care utilization by physicians may be influenced by the cost environment
in which they trained as residents,[35] suggesting that early intervention may be helpful.
Training on appropriateness criteria and practice guidelines should be a priority for the future.
The effectiveness of these interventions warrants further study as they are not yet well known
to increase appropriateness of medical care. Physician engagement is needed to address the
problem of overtreatment in health care.
