Abstract
Background: A growing body of evidence suggests that healthcare practitioners who enhance how they express
empathy can improve patient health, and reduce medico-legal risk. However we do not know how consistently
healthcare practitioners express adequate empathy. In this study, we addressed this gap by investigating patient
rankings of practitioner empathy.
Methods: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies that asked patients to rate their
practitioners’ empathy using the Consultation and Relational Empathy (CARE) measure. CARE is emerging as the
most common and best-validated patient rating of practitioner empathy. We searched: MEDLINE, Embase,
PsycINFO, Cinahl, Science & Social Science Citation Indexes, the Cochrane Library and PubMed from database
inception to March 2016. We excluded studies that did not use the CARE measure. Two reviewers independently
screened titles and extracted data on average CARE scores, demographic data for patients and practitioners, and
type of healthcare practitioners.
Results: Sixty-four independent studies within 51 publications had sufficient data to pool. The average CARE score
was 40.48 (95% CI, 39.24 to 41.72). This rank s in the bottom 5th percentile in comparison with scores collected by
CARE developers. Longer consultations (n = 13) scored 15% higher (42.60, 95% CI 40.66 to 44.54) than shorter
(n = 9) consultations (34.93, 95% CI 32.63 to 37.24). Studies with mostly (>50%) female practitioners (n = 6) showed
16% higher empathy scores (42.77, 95% CI 38.98 to 46.56) than those with mostly (>50%) male (n = 6) practitioners
(34.84, 95% CI 30.98 to 38.71). There were statistically significant (P = 0.032) differences between types of providers
(allied health professionals, medical students, physicians, and traditional Chinese doctors). Allied Health Professionals
(n = 6) scored the highest (45.29, 95% CI 41.38 to 49.20), and physicians (n = 39) scored the lowest (39.68, 95% CI
38.29 to 41.08). Patients in Australia, the USA, and the UK reported highest empathy ratings (>43 average CARE),
with lowest scores (<35 average CARE scores) in Hong Kong.
Conclusions: Patient rankings of practitioner empathy are highly variable, with female practitioners expressing
empathy to patients more effectively than male practitioners. The high variability of patient rating of practitioner
empathy is likely to be associated with variable patient health outcomes. Limitations included frequent failure to
report response rates introducing a risk of response bias. Future work is warranted to investigate ways to reduce
the variability in practitioner empathy.

 Background
A growing number of randomized trials show that when
healthcare practitioners are encouraged to enhance how they
express empathy, this can reduce patient pain, [1, 2] lower
patient anxiety, [3] increase patient satisfaction, [4, 5] im-
prove medication adherence, [6, 7] and ameliorate other pa-
tient health outcomes. [8–11]. For example, Chassany’s [1]
empathy training intervention for general practitioners (GPs)
(n = 180) reduced pain in osteoarthritis patients (n = 842) by
one point on a 10-point VAS (P < 0.0001). These modest
benefits are comparable to many pharmaceutical interven-
tions without the adverse events. Hence some authors have
recently called for efforts to encourage empathic care [12].
Supporting the view that empathic care should be en-
couraged, the extent to which healthcare practitioners ex-
press empathy seems to be lacking in some cases, [13–16]
and it may decline with time in practice [17]. The in-
creased burden of paperwork, which takes up a quarter of
practitioner time, [18] may be a barrier to empathic care.
However we do not know the prevalence of inadequate
empathy. If adequate empathy is rare, then patients and
practitioners would both likely benefit if practitioners re-
inforced how they display empathy. In this study, we
aimed to address this gap by conducting a systematic re-
view of patient ratings of practitioner empathy.
An obstacle to empathy research is that practitioner em-
pathy is difficult to define theoretically [19, 20]. At the
same time there is an emerging consensus that empathy
can be operationalized as a healthcare practitioner’s ability
to understand a patient’s point of view, express this under-
standing, and make a recommendation that reflects the
shared understanding [21, 22]. More importantly for
present purposes, while empathy is measured using differ-
ent scales, [23, 24] only one patient-rating of practitioner
empathy demonstrated evidence of reliability, [25] internal
validity and consistency: CARE [25, 26]. From a patient
health perspective, patient ratings of practitioner empathy
are likely to be important. We therefore limited our review
to studies that used the CARE measure.
Objectives
Our primary objective was to measure the extent to which
patients (of any type) report their healthcare practitioners
(of any type) to be empathic. Our secondary objective was
to compare differences in empathy ratings between differ-
ent practitioner groups (male versus female, consultation
times, different types of practitioners, and practitioners in
different countries).
Methods
Protocol and registration
The protocol for this review was published in PROSPERO
(record no. CRD42016037456). We made two changes to
the protocol. In the protocol we proposed to analyze
CARE scores before and after training, however there
were insufficient studies to complete this analysis. We also
had insufficient data to perform the proposed analyses
comparing practitioners with 10 years or more experience
with those who had less than 10 years experience. Neither
of these changes was related to our main study aim.
Eligibility criteria
We included any study where patients rated their practi-
tioners’ empathy using the CARE measure. We included
ratings of any practitioner including nurses, doctors, alter-
native practitioners, and medical students. We included
studies in any language, provided that the translation of
the CARE questionnaire was validated.
We excluded studies that used other measures of em-
pathy, because only CARE has been validated. An added
benefit of this approach is that it reduced heterogeneity.
We excluded studies where practitioners were reported to
have been trained in empathy prior to being rated by pa-
tients, since we were interested in pre-training empathy
ratings. Where the publications included surveys of more
than one group of practitioners the surveys were treated
independently.
CARE asks patients to answer 10 questions about the
consultation with their practitioner such as whether the
practitioner: made the patient feel at ease, really listened
and understood, showed compassion, and explained
things clearly (see Additional file 1). Each question can
be answered by ticking one of five options: poor, fair,
good, very good, excellent, does not apply, with the low-
est being given a score of ‘1’
, and the highest a score of
‘5’. Hence, the maximum CARE score is 50. The devel-
opers of the CARE measure have produced normative
values based on administration of their questionnaire
[27]. They found that the mean CARE score was 45.75,
and that 5% of CARE scores fell above 48.32, and 5% fell
below 40.72.

 contacted authors of studies to ask whether they are aware
of any additional studies.
Data collection, extraction, and management
After piloting the extraction sheet by two authors (JH,
KM), two authors (LS, AU) independently screened all
titles and abstracts and extracted data. Discrepancies
were resolved with discussion by a third author (JH).
We extracted data about: type of practitioner, percentage
female practitioners, country, average CARE score, and
individual CARE scores (where available).
We assessed risk of bias within studies by measuring
response rates. It was not feasible to assess risk of bias
across studies, for example by conducting a funnel plot
since there was no reason to suspect higher (or lower)
CARE scores varying with sample size. There was insuf-
ficient data to investigate risk of bias across studies.
Statistical analyses were performed using the program
Comprehensive Meta Analysis [28]. We provided the
mean and 95% confidence interval of the CARE score.
We contacted study authors via email to obtain missing
data with respect to participants, outcomes, or summary
data. Participant data were analysed as reported. We
conducted preplanned subgroup analyses to assess the
extent to which proportion of female practitioners, con-
sultation duration, type of practitioner, and country
played a role. To evaluate the predictive value of gender
and consultation time with respect to CARE scores we
performed a multivariable regression analysis, with gen-
der and consultation time included as the independent
variables, and CARE scores included as the dependent
variable.
Sensitivity and subgroup analyses
We conducted four preplanned subgroup analyses.
1. Longer (>10 min) consultations compared with
shorter (≤ 10 min) consultations. This was based
on average consultation times in UK general
practice [29].
2. Gender: average empathy ratings of mostly (>50%)
female compared with average ratings of mostly
(>50%) male practitioners.
3. When there were at least three studies within the
same country, we conducted a subgroup analysis
with those three countries, and compared it with the
complement. We chose three studies because fewer
than three makes meta-analysis problematic and in-
creases the likelihood of basing conclusions on
anomalous results.
4. Types of practitioners (physicians, medical students,
alternative practitioners, etc.). If there were at least
three studies that measured patient ratings of

Results
Main results
Our search yielded 392 independent records, of which
69 studies met our inclusion criteria (see Supplemental
Material). Of these, 64 independent study groups (within
51 publications) had sufficient data to be included in our
meta-analysis (see Table 1, Fig. 1, Additional file 3). See
Additional file 4 for excluded studies.
The 64 study groups were from 15 different countries:
UK (n = 23), USA (n = 6), Hong Kong (n = 9), Germany
(n = 7), Australia (n = 4), China (n = 6), Ethiopia (n = 2),
South Korea (n = 2), and one study from each of Brazil,
Croatia, France, India, and Japan. The types of practi-
tioners included primary care physicians, practitioners of
Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), medical students,
allied health professionals, and other specialists.
The average CARE score for the 64 study groups was
40.48 (95% CI, 39.24 to 41.72) (see Table 2, Fig. 2).
Twenty-two studies reported consultation times. Longer
consultations (≥10 min; n = 13) scored higher (42.60,
95% CI 40.69 to 44.52) than shorter (<10 min; n = 9)
consultations (34.93, 95% CI 32.66 to 37.21). This differ-
ence of 7.67 points (15%) between longer and shorter
consultations was highly significant (P < 0.001). Twelve
studies provided data on the gender of practitioners
(Table 2). Studies with predominantly female practi-
tioners (n = 6) showed higher empathy scores (42.77,
95% CI 38.98 to 46.56) than those with predominantly
male practitioners (n = 6, 34.85, 95% CI 30.98 to 38.71).
This difference of 7.92 points (16%) was statistically sig-
nificant (P = 0.004).
Fifty-five study groups could be included in the pre-
planned subgroup analysis by country (Table 2). Highest
empathy scores were found in Australia (n = 4, 44.88,
95% CI 42.63 to 47.14), USA (n = 6, 44.56, 95% CI 42.71
to 46.40) and UK (n = 23, 43.07, 95% CI 42.11 to 44.04).
Scores were lowest in Hong Kong (n = 9, 33.46, 95% CI
31.94 to 34.99). Scores in Germany (n = 7, 40.72, 95% CI
39.02 to 42.44) and China (n = 6, 40.61, 95% CI 38.68 to
42.55) were in-between. We added an exploratory ana-
lysis by country including all 64 study groups and found

 that scores in India (n = 1, 29.49, 95% CI 24.18 to 34.80)
were lower than those in Hong Kong. Scores in the UK,
USA and Australia were highest (See Additional file 5).
We found at least three studies each measured empathy
in the following types of providers: physicians, medical
students, allied health professionals, and practitioners of
Traditional Chinese Medicine (Table 2). There was statis-
tically significant heterogeneity between these (P = 0.032),
with allied health professionals scoring the highest (n = 5,
45.29, 95% CI 41.38 to 49.20), and physicians scoring the
lowest (n = 39, 39.68, 95% CI 38.29 to 41.08). We found
no differences between primary care physicians, special-
ists, and complementary and alternative medicine (CAM)
providers, (P = 0.386) (see Table 3).
A multivariable regression analysis was performed to
analyze the predictive value of gender and consultation
time with respect to CARE scores. Consultation duration
was the only significant predictor for CARE scores
(Table 4).
Risk of bias
The response rate was reported in 20 of the 53 studies
(38%), with the average rate being high (69%, ranging from
21% to 100%). The uncertainty about the remaining re-
sponse rates entails a risk of response bias.
Discussion
We found that patient rating of practitioner empathy is
highly variable, with some practitioners being reported
to express empathy much less effectively to patients than
others. Female practitioners, allied health professionals,
those who spend more time with patients, and practi-
tioners from Australia, the US, and the UK seem to dis-
play empathy more effectively than other practitioners.
In addition, the average care score we identified was low
in comparison with normative values, falling in the low-
est 5% of CARE scores measured by the developers of
the questionnaire [27]. The highly variable scores we
found are likely to be associated with variable patient
outcomes [9–11, 30].
Strengths and limitations
This is the first systematic review to investigate the
extent to which healthcare practitioners are empathic.
Another strength is that it used measures of the only
validated patient-rated measure of practitioner empathy.
As such, it provides a good indication of the differences
between perceived empathy across gender, disciplines,
and countries.
There are also several potential limitations. First, our
method for measuring the difference between female
and male practitioners was likely to be an underestimate.
If studies with majority female practitioners resulted in
greater patient-rated empathy, it is reasonable to assume
that if all the practitioners were female, the difference
between male and female practitioners would have been
greater. In the context of this observational research we
do not know whether the additional time caused female
practitioners to be more empathic, or whether female
practitioners’ higher empathy caused them to spend
more time with patients, or whether these two factors
cannot be separated. Second, response bias [26, 31, 32]
could have affected the results. Patients who know they
are rating their practitioners may wish to please their
practitioners, [33] for example by giving them higher
scores than they otherwise would [31, 32]. The lack of
response rate reporting in most of the studies makes the
extent of this problem unclear. Furthermore, selection
bias might have influenced the results: the CARE ques-
tionnaire could be delivered in areas where the empathy
of the practitioners is believed to be anomalous (either
particularly high or particularly low). Next, the compari-
son between countries could have been influenced by
the number of studies per country. Specifically, some of
the countries with low scores had very few studies
(Croatia had 1, Ethiopia had 2, and India had 1). More-
over in spite of validation of CARE translations, patients
in different countries may have divergent prior expecta-
tions and beliefs about what it means to be an empathic
practitioner. Finally, the comparison with normative
values (resulting in the average score we found being in
the lowest 5%) is problematic. In spite of being relatively
low, the average score is still above 40. Further work
needs to be done to investigate the meaning of average
CARE scores.

 Conclusions
Implications for clinical practice and clinical research
The way different healthcare practitioners express em-
pathy to patients is low (on average) in comparison with
normative scores, and highly variable. Given the likely
association between practitioner empathy and patient
outcomes, further research is now warranted to investi-
gate how these findings can be used to improve patient
care. Future reports of the CARE questionnaire should
include all the potentially relevant factors we have iden-
tified here, especially details about response rates, and
also consultation duration, gender, experience of practi-
tioners, and other demographic details of patient raters
and practitioners.
