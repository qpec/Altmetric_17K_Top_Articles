The  present
 study  examined
 the  association
 of
 anxiety  and  impulsivity
 with
 premature
 muzzle  grayness
among
 young
 dogs.  A  sample  of  400  dogs,  ages  1–4  years  was  obtained
 at  dog  parks,
 shows,
 veterinary
clinics,
 and  other  venues.
 Each  dog  was  photographed
 and the  degree
 of  muzzle  grayness
 was
 rated  on
an
 ordinal
 scale
 ranging
 from  “no  gray”  to  “full  gray.”
 White  or pale
 colored  dogs  were  dropped
 from  the
study
 because
 it  was  impossible
 to  determine
 degree  of
 grayness.
 Each  owner
 filled  out
 a  questionnaire
assessing
 the  constructs
 of  anxiety  and  impulsivity,
 as well
 as other  behaviors
 and  characteristics.
 To
prevent
 response
 bias,  owners  were  told  that  the  purpose
 of  the study  involved  dog  lifestyle.
 Distractor
items
 were
 added  to  the  survey
 to  prevent
 the  owner  from  guessing
 the  purpose
 of  the  survey.
 Exam-
ples
 of  survey
 items
 indicating
 anxiety
 included:
 destruction
 when  left alone;  hair
 loss on  vet exam
 or
being
 in a new  place;  and  cringes/cowers
 in  response
 to  groups
 of  people.
 Examples
 of  survey
 items
indicating
 impulsivity
 included:
 jumping
 on  people,
 inability
 to  calm,  loss  of
 focus,  hyperactivity
 after
exercise.
 In
 our  sample
 of  young
 dogs,  latent
 variable
 regression
 showed
 that
 the  extent
 of  muzzle  gray-
ness
 was  significantly
 and  positively
 predicted
 by  anxiety
 (p =  0.005)  and  impulsivity
 (p  <  0.001).
 Dog
size,
 spay/neuter
 status,
 or  medical
 problems
 did not  predict  extent
 of  muzzle
 grayness.
 Fear  responses
to
 loud noise,  unfamiliar
 animals  and  people  were  associated
 with  increased
 grayness.
 Ordinal
 regres-
sion
 analysis
 showed
 that  muzzle
 grayness
 was  significantly
 predicted
 by  fear  of  loud  noises  (p  =  0.001),
unfamiliar
 animals
 (p
 =  0.031),
 and  unfamiliar
 people  (p  <
 0.001).  Premature
 graying  in
 young  dogs
 may
be
 a possible
 indicator
 of  anxiety,
 fear  or  impulsivity
 issues
 in  dogs  under
 four  years  of  age.

 Introduction
As
 dogs
 mature,
 it
 is
 not
 uncommon
 to
 see
 facial
 hairs
 begin
to
 lose
 pigment,
 resulting
 in
 graying
 of
 the
 muzzle
 line
 hair
 coat.
In
 reviewing
 case
 studies
 in
 an
 animal
 behavior
 practice
 along
 the
Front
 Range
 of
 Colorado,
 USA,
 it
 was
 noted
 anecdotally
 that
 there
were
 numerous
 observed
 cases
 in
 which
 young
 dogs
 (four
 years
 or
less)
 showed
 premature
 graying
 in
 the
 muzzle
 line.
 Informal
 exami-
nation
 of
 the
 cases
 showed
 many
 of
 the
 dogs
 identified
 as
 displaying
premature
 graying,
 had
 anxiety
 or
 impulse
 control
 issues.
 A
 review
of
 the
 scientific
 literature
 revealed
 no
 prior
 work
 researching
 pre-
mature
 graying
 in
 canines.

Premature
 graying
 in
 humans
 has
 received
 a
 fair
 amount
 of
inquiry.
 An
 examination
 of
 “before
 and
 after”
 photographs
 of
United
 States
 presidents,
 shows
 an
 increase
 in
 the
 amount
 of
gray
 hair
 by
 the
 end
 of
 their
 four
 year
 term.
 Scientists
 debate
whether
 this
 graying
 among
 presidents
 is
 related
 to
 stress
 or
 genet-
ics
 (Wolchover,
 2011;
 Willingham,
 2013).
 The
 scientific
 literature
assesses
 associative
 factors
 for
 premature
 graying
 in
 humans.
 The
literature
 regarding
 such
 evidence
 may
 be
 classified
 into
 four
 cate-
gories:
 (1)
 physiological
 oxidative
 stress
 at
 the
 cellular
 level
 (Kauser
et
 al.,
 2011),
 (2)
 genetics
 (Trueb
 and
 Tobin,
 2010),
 (3)
 disease-based
premature
 graying
 (Kocaman
 et
 al.,
 2012),
 and
 (4)
 emotional
 or
work-related
 stress
 (Tenibiaje,
 2013).
 At
 this
 time,
 no
 single
 causal
factor
 has
 been
 determined
 definitively
 to
 predict
 premature
 gray-
ing
 in
 humans.
 Additionally,
 there
 is
 minimal
 extant
 research
 on
premature
 graying
 in
 mammals,
 specifically
 dogs.
Disease-based
 premature
 graying
 suggests
 a
 lifestyle
 of
 stress
that
 influences
 the
 hair
 follicles
 and
 melanocytes
 to
 show
 low-

ered
 resistance
 to
 stress
 (Westgate
 et
 al.,
 2013).
 Genetic
 propensity
to
 premature
 graying
 may
 be
 compounded
 by
 environmental
factors,
 inflammation,
 or
 psychological
 stress
 (Brownlee,
 2004).
The
 literature
 review
 shows
 evidence
 of
 other
 factors
 associated
with
 premature
 graying
 in
 humans
 such
 as:
 lifestyle
 influences
(Westgate
 et
 al.,
 2013);
 personality
 (Tucker
 and
 Friedman,
 1996;
Hampson
 and
 Friedman,
 2008);
 pain
 (Hassett
 et
 al.,
 2012);
 and
anxiety
 (Samarakoon
 et
 al.,
 2011).
In
 addition
 to
 cellular
 stress,
 genetics
 and
 disease,
 research
 sug-
gests
 that
 there
 are
 emotional
 associations
 to
 premature
 graying
in
 humans.
 Samarakoon
 et
 al.
 (2011)
 conducted
 a
 study
 exam-
ining
 how
 biological
 and
 social
 lifestyle
 of
 individuals
 related
 to
aging.
 In
 this
 study,
 the
 Hamilton
 Anxiety
 and
 Depression
 Rating
Scales—which
 included
 such
 indicators
 as
 insomnia,
 depression,
anxious
 mood,
 and
 tension
 in
 lifestyles—were
 completed.
 The
 data
showed
 that
 these
 indicators
 accelerated
 aging
 in
 young
 individ-
uals.
 Similarly,
 certain
 behavioral
 and
 psychosocial
 mechanisms
such
 as
 personality
 and
 emotional
 response
 patterns
 have
 been
shown
 to
 have
 an
 effect
 on
 health
 (Jelinek,
 1972;
 Tucker
 and
Freidman,
 1996).
 Mental
 and
 emotional
 changes
 such
 as
 depres-
sion,
 feelings
 of
 loneliness,
 emotional
 instability
 and
 anxiety
 in
humans
 can
 be
 associated
 with
 aging
 and
 premature
 hair
 graying
(Ballantyne,
 2007;
 Rosch,
 2009).
 Further
 research
 from
 Tenibiaje
(2013)
 details
 how
 work-related
 stress
 relates
 to
 premature
 aging
and
 graying
 of
 hair
 in
 humans.
 Heavy
 work
 demands
 can
 exert
 pres-
sures
 on
 the
 body
 ranging
 from
 chronic
 mental
 stress
 to
 exhaustion.
These
 demands
 alter
 bodily
 production
 of
 adrenaline,
 which
 is
 asso-
ciated
 with
 hair
 color
 changes,
 and
 can
 have
 other
 adverse
 effects
on
 the
 body.
 Just
 as
 in
 humans,
 stress
 from
 anxiety
 or
 fear
 can
 have
a
 negative
 impact
 on
 health
 in
 canines
 (Dreschel,
 2010).
In
 contrast
 to
 the
 multiple
 studies
 related
 to
 aging/graying
 in
humans
 and
 mice,
 a
 single
 study
 was
 identified
 that
 potentially
relates
 to
 premature
 graying
 in
 canines.
 Siniscalchi
 et
 al.
 (2013)
used
 a
 sample
 of
 dogs
 to
 show
 that
 behavioral
 measures
 such
 as
 hid-
ing,
 running
 away,
 seeking
 attention
 from
 the
 tester,
 panting,
 and
lowering
 of
 the
 body
 posture
 were
 correlated
 with
 higher
 measured
levels
 of
 cortisol
 in
 the
 hair.
 The
 levels
 of
 cortisol
 in
 hair
 reflected
the
 dog’s
 chronic
 state
 of
 emotional
 reactivity
 or
 temperament.
Research
 with
 humans
 and
 mice
 consistently
 demonstrates
 that
stress
 is
 associated
 with
 premature
 aging
 (Tobin
 and
 Paus,
 2001;
Sanders,
 2009).
 The
 primary
 research
 question
 for
 the
 present
 study
was:
 (RQ1)
 “Do
 owner
 reported
 levels
 of
 anxiety
 and
 impulsivity
levels
 predict
 premature
 graying
 in
 young
 dogs?”
 Our
 hypothe-
sis
 was
 that,
 among
 dogs
 of
 a
 young
 age
 (1–4
 years),
 anxiety
 and
impulsivity
 would
 show
 a
 positive
 association
 with
 the
 extent
 of
premature
 graying
 at
 the
 muzzle
 line.
 We  additionally
 asked,
 (RQ2)
“Do
 responses
 to
 specific
 fear
 stimuli
 (thunderstorms/loud
 noises,
and
 unfamiliar
 places/animals/people)
 predict
 premature
 graying
in
 young
 dogs?”
 Finally,
 we
 posed
 an
 exploratory
 research
 ques-
tion
 (RQ3),
 “Does
 the
 presence
 of
 other
 dogs
 in
 the
 household,
the
 presence
 of
 cats
 in
 the
 household,
 participation
 in
 organized
or
 competitive
 activities,
 and
 the
 amount
 of
 time
 the
 dog
 spent
unsupervised
 outdoors
 predict
 premature
 muzzle
 graying
 in
 young
dogs?”

 Methods
Permission
 for
 this
 study
 was
 granted
 through
 the
 Institutional
Review
 Board
 (IRB)
 and
 Institutional
 Animal
 Care
 and
 Use
 Commit-
tee
 (IACUC)
 at
 Northern
 Illinois
 University
 (Dekalb,
 Illinois).
2.1.
 Animals
 and
 marketing
A
 sample
 of
 N
 =
 400
 dogs
 (198
 females,
 202
 males)
 was
 used
in
 this
 study.
 Initially
 443
 dogs
 were
 screened,
 but
 43
 dogs
 were
eliminated
 from
 the
 study
 due
 to
 failure
 to
 meet
 criteria.
 These
criteria
 included
 age
 (1–4
 years)
 and
 breed-specific
 hair
 color
 that
allowed
 for
 the
 researchers
 to
 discern
 presence
 or
 absence
 of
 gray
muzzle
 hair.
 Dogs
 were
 eliminated
 from
 the
 study
 if
 it
 was
 too
difficult
 or
 impossible
 for
 the
 researchers
 to
 determine
 if
 the
 dog
had
 a
 gray-colored
 muzzle.
 Dogs
 excluded
 from
 the
 study
 included
breeds
 that
 presented
 with
 muzzle
 hair
 coats
 that
 were
 white
 (e.g.,
Great
 Pyrenees,
 Samoyeds,
 Eskimo
 dogs),
 pale
 cream-colored
 (e.g.,
Golden
 Retrievers,
 Shiba
 Inus),
 gray
 (e.g.,
 Bedlington
 terriers,
 Poo-
dles),
 or
 merled
 (e.g.,
 Australian
 cattle
 dogs,
 Australian
 Shepherds).
Any
 pure-breed
 or
 mix-breed
 dog
 was
 allowed
 in
 the
 study
 as
 long
as
 age
 and
 color
 requirements
 were
 met.
Dogs
 were
 obtained
 from
 multiple
 venues.
 Flyers
 were
 placed
in
 veterinary
 clinics,
 pet
 stores,
 dog
 parks,
 and
 at
 dog
 shows
 across
the
 Front
 Range
 of
 Colorado,
 USA.
 Anonymity
 of
 human
 partici-
pants
 was
 maintained
 throughout
 data
 collection.
 The
 flyers
 were
placed
 in
 these
 heavily-concentrated
 dog
 areas
 specifying
 dates
and
 times
 the
 researchers
 would
 be
 present
 to
 collect
 data,
 should
the
 dog
 owner
 want
 to
 participate
 in
 the
 study.
 The
 researchers
also
 presented
 at
 dog
 parks
 during
 the
 heaviest
 dog
 traffic
 times–-
usually
 weekends
 and
 before
 and
 after
 work
 hours
 on
 week-days.
Researchers
 also
 attended
 local
 dog
 shows
 that
 were
 advertised
online.
 Permission
 from
 the
 dog
 show
 hosts
 was
 obtained
 prior
 to
data
 collection.
 Dog
 owners
 were
 very
 willing
 to
 have
 their
 dog
 par-
ticipate
 in
 data
 collection
 for
 this
 study.
 Although
 much
 time
 was
spent
 organizing
 calendar
 days/times
 for
 data
 collection
 at
 veteri-
nary
 clinics
 and
 pet
 stores,
 more
 than
 65%
 of
 the
 dogs
 participating
in
 the
 study
 were
 found
 at
 dog
 parks
 and
 dog
 shows.
2.2.
 Data
 collection
Dog
 owners
 were
 asked
 to
 participate
 in
 a
 research
 study
 on
 dog
behavior
 lifestyles
 that
 included
 completing
 a
 short
 questionnaire
and
 allowing
 a
 photograph
 of
 their
 dog.
 Dog
 owners
 were
 blinded
to
 the
 purpose
 of
 the
 study
 to
 avoid
 biasing
 the
 results.
 Written
informed
 consent
 was
 provided
 by
 all
 dog
 owners
 who
 permitted
their
 dog
 to
 participate
 in
 the
 study.
2.3.
 Questionnaire
The
 42-item
 questionnaire
 was
 developed
 by
 the
 authors.
Demographic
 data
 were
 collected
 as
 well
 as
 information
 on
 the
dog’s
 participation
 in
 organized
 or
 competitive
 activities
 (e.g.
agility,
 search
 and
 rescue,
 service
 dog
 work);
 knowledge
 of
 basic
obedience
 commands;
 the
 amount
 of
 time
 the
 dog
 spent
 outside
unsupervised;
 presence
 of
 other
 animals
 (dogs
 or
 cats)
 in
 the
 dog’s
place
 of
 residence;
 medical
 history;
 current
 medications
 taken,
 and
pain
 issues.
 The
 questionnaire
 also
 included
 two
 specific
 multi-
item
 scales
 intended
 to
 assess
 levels
 of
 (1)
 fear/anxiety,
 and
 (2)
impulsivity/arousal
 in
 the
 dogs
 (Table
 1).
The
 researcher
 reviewed
 each
 completed
 questionnaire
 imme-
diately
 after
 submission
 for
 completeness,
 or
 to
 clarify
 responses.
The
 questionnaire
 also
 included
 several
 non-relevant
 distractor
items
 (e.g.,
 “Does
 your
 dog
 have
 hind
 limb
 dewclaws?”)
 so
 that
participants
 would
 be
 less
 likely
 to
 guess
 the
 purpose
 of
 the
 study.
2.4.
 Definitions
Anxiety
 is
 defined
 as
 a
 reaction
 to
 a
 prospective
 or
 imagined
danger
 and
 includes
 physiological
 and
 behavioral
 signs
 (p.
 1081,
Sherman
 and
 Mills,
 2008).
 Symptoms
 may
 include
 restlessness,
stress
 whining,
 barking,
 closeness
 in
 proximity
 to
 an
 owner,
 and
avoidance
 to
 name
 a
 few
 (Rooney
 et
 al.,
 2007;
 Sherman
 and
 Mills,
2008).
 Shedding
 hair
 coats
 in
 dogs
 (Klein,
 2012)
 and
 hair
 loss
in
 humans
 can
 also
 be
 related
 to
 anxiety
 and
 emotional
 distress
(Sinclair,
 1999;
 Trueb,
 2008).

Impulsivity
 is
 defined
 as
 a
 trait
 related
 to
 inhibitory
 control
 and
is
 expressed
 in
 a
 range
 of
 behaviors
 (p.676,
 Wright
 et
 al.,
 2012).
 In
humans,
 anxiety
 is
 associated
 with
 impulsivity
 (Taylor
 et
 al.,
 2008).
In
 dogs,
 a
 loss
 of
 concentration
 with
 difficulty
 to
 focus,
 challenges
to
 maintain
 a
 stay
 position,
 endless
 barking,
 and
 hyperactivity
 are
some
 of
 the
 indicators
 for
 impulsivity
 (Lit
 et
 al.,
 2010).

 Photographs
Two
 photographs
 were
 taken
 of
 each
 dog
 at
 the
 same
 time
 the
questionnaire
 was
 completed
 by
 the
 owner
 to
 provide
 evidence
 of
the
 degree
 of
 premature
 graying
 the
 dog
 possessed.
 One
 photo-
graph
 provided
 a
 side
 view
 of
 the
 dog’s
 head,
 the
 other
 photograph
provided
 a
 frontal
 view
 of
 the
 head,
 specifically
 the
 mouth
 and
 chin.
Photographs
 were
 taken
 by
 a
 digital
 camera
 approximately
 three
to
 five
 feet
 (1
 m–1.75
 m)
 away
 from
 the
 dog.

2.7.
 Analyses
Descriptive
 statistics
 and
 frequencies
 for
 characteristics
 of
 the
dogs
 were
 first
 computed.
 To
 address
 the
 association
 of
 anxiety
and
 impulsivity
 with
 the
 extent
 of
 graying
 in
 dogs,
 a
 latent
 vari-
able
 regression
 analysis
 (Bollen,
 1989;
 Everitt,
 1984)
 was
 carried
out,
 where
 the
 mean
 grayness
 ratings
 across
 the
 two
 raters
 served
as
 an
 ordinally-coded
 dependent
 variable,
 and
 owner
 responses
 to
the
 relevant
 anxiety
 and
 impulsivity
 items
 on
 questionnaire
 served
as
 indicators
 for
 two
 latent
 predictors—anxiety
 and
 impulsivity.
Modeling
 anxiety
 and
 impulsivity
 as
 latent
 variables
 were
 used
 to
account
 for
 potential

 in
 these
 scales.

 using

assignment
 (Little
 et
 al.,
 2002)
 was
 employed
 to
 construct
 four
 item

 for
 each
 of
 the
 two
 latent
 constructs.
 Due
 to
 observed
 non-

 in
 responses
 to
 the

 scale
 items,
robust
 maximum

 estimation
 was
 used
 for
 this
 model.
To
 address
 how
 reactions
 to
 specific
 fear
 stimuli
 (thunder-
storms,
 loud
 noises,
 unfamiliar
 places,
 unfamiliar
 animals,
 and
unfamiliar
 people)
 were
 related
 to
 ratings
 of
 muzzle
 grayness
 (i.e.,
RQ2),
 ordinal
 regression
 was
 carried
 out
 using
 each
 of
 these
 predic-
tors.
 Similarly,
 to
 address
 how
 the
 presence
 of
 other
 animals
 (dogs
or
 cats)
 in
 the
 household,
 participation
 in
 organized
 or
 competi-
tive
 activities,
 and
 time

 unsupervised
 outdoors
 was
 related
to
 muzzle
 grayness
 (i.e.
 RQ3),
 ordinal

 was
 carried
 out
with
 these
 variables
 as
 predictors.
Control

 in
 each
 of
 the
 regression
 models
 described
above
 included

 Results
Table

 provides
 descriptive
 information
 about
 the
 sample
(N
 =
 400)
 of
 dogs.
 As
 can
 be
 seen,
 dogs
 were
 uniformly
 represented
by
 sex,
 relatively
 few
 had
 medical
 problems
 or
 were
 on
 behavioral
medication.
 Most
 were
 spayed/neutered,
 were
 medium-sized,
 and
knew
 basic
 obedience
 commands
 (e.g.,
 “sit,”
 or
 “stay”).
 The
 mean
age
 of
 dogs
 was
 2.54
 years
 (SD
 =
 1.04).
 Table
 3
 shows
 the
 joint
distribution
 of
 the
 grayness
 ratings
 by
 rater.
 For
 ordinal
 data,
 an
appropriate
 index
 of
 inter-rater
 reliability/agreement
 is
 weighted
Kappa
 (Cohen,
 1968),
 which
 emphasizes
 large
 differences
 in
 rat-
ings
 more
 than
 small
 differences.
 Based
 on
 Landis
 and
 Koch
 (1977)
guidelines
 for
 interpretation
 of
 Kappa,
 inter-rater
 agreement
 for
these
 ordinal
 ratings
 was
 strong
 (weighted
 Kappa
 =
 0.855).
 Slightly
less
 than
 half
 of
 the
 sample
 of
 dogs
 (46%)
 showed
 no
 muzzle
 gray-
ing.
Messick
 (1995),
 in
 his
 influential
 unified
 construct-based
 model
of
 validity,
 describes
 how
 validity
 is
 properly
 viewed
 as
 a
 property
of
 inferences
 made
 from
 data,
 rather
 than
 a
 property
 of
 instruments
per
 se.
 As
 such,
 evidence
 for
 the
 validity
 of
 inferences
 is
 an
 ongoing
process
 occurring
 over
 multiple
 studies,
 with
 this
 evidence
 poten-
tially
 coming
 from
 a
 variety
 of
 sources.
 Within
 this
 framework,
a
 method
 that
 has
 become
 widely-used
 for
 providing
 evidence
of
 construct
 validity
 is
 confirmatory
 factor
 analysis
 (CFA),
 which
posits
 an
 a
 priori
 structure
 for
 the
 data
 that
 is
 consistent
 with
 the
constructs
 being
 assessed,
 and
 assesses
 whether
 the
 data
 support
this
 structure
 (see

 Conversely,

 except
 for
 fear
 of

 (a

 providing
 some
 evidence
 of
 the
 convergent
 and

 of
 these
 the

 constructs.
The
 correlation
 between
 the
 two
 latent

 (anxiety

 was,
 as
 expected,
 moderate
 (r
 =

 the
 extent
 of
 muzzle

 was
 significantly
 and
 positively
 predicted
 by
 both
 anxiety
(b
 =
 0.339,
 p
 =
 0.005)
 and
 impulsivity
 (b
 =
 0.503,
 p
 <

 Specif-
ically,
 examination
 of
 adjusted
 odds-ratios
 (AORs)
 showed
 that
increased
 levels
 of
 anxiety
 and
 impulsivity
 were
 associated
 with
increased
 extent
 of
 muzzle
 grayness
 (AOR
 =
 1.403
 and
 AOR
 =
 1.654,
respectively).
 Among
 the
 control
 variables
 in

 was
 significantly
 and
 positively
 associated
 with
 age
of
 the
 dog
 (b

 and

 higher
 levels
 of

 than
 males
 (b

 Dog
 size,
 spay/neuter
 status,
 and
 presence
 of
 medical
problems
 did
 not
 significantly
 predict
 extent
 of
 muzzle
 grayness.
In
 a
 similar
 manner,
 to
 address
 the
 effects
 of
 reported
 responses
to
 fear
 stimuli
 on
 muzzle
 graying,
 ordinal
 regression
 analysis
 was
carried
 out,
 regressing
 the
 ordinal
 grayness
 ratings
 on
 dichoto-
mous
 (yes/no)
 owner
 reports
 of
 dogs’
 fear
 response
 to
 five
 potential
fear-inducing

 The
 dogs’
 age,
 sex,
 spay/neuter
 status,
 size,
and
 presence
 of
 medical

 again
 served
 as
 control
 variables.
Results
 (Table

 showed
 that

 Dogs
 whose
 owners
 reported
 fear
responses
 to
 these
 stimuli
 showed
 increased
 levels
 of
 muzzle
 gray-
ness
 compared
 to
 dogs
 not
 exhibiting
 such
 responses.
Lastly,
 we
 examined
 whether
 the
 presence
 of
 other
 dogs
 in
the
 household,
 the
 presence
 of
 cats
 in
 the
 household,
 participa-
tion
 in
 organized
 or
 competitive
 activities,
 and
 the
 amount
 of
 time
the
 dog
 spent
 unsupervised
 outdoors
 was
 associated
 with
 muzzle
grayness.
 When
 controlling
 age,
 sex,
 spay/neuter
 status,
 size,
 and
presence
 of
 medical
 problems,
 the
 results
 (Table
 6)
 showed
 that
none
 of
 these
 variables
 was
 significantly
 related
 to
 muzzle
 grayness
(each
 p
 >
 0.05).
 Follow-up
 analysis,
 however,
 introducing
 anxiety
as
 a
 potential
 moderator
 of
 this
 relationship,
 showed
 that
 a
 dog’s
level
 of
 anxiety
 significantly
 moderated
 the
 effects
 of
 participa-
tion
 in
 organized
 or
 competitive
 activities
 on
 muzzle
 grayness,
 with
dogs
 with
 higher
 anxiety
 showing
 a
 significantly
 stronger
 positive
relationship
 between
 participation
 in
 these
 activities
 and
 muzzle
grayness
 than
 dogs
 with
 low
 levels
 of
 anxiety
 (b
 =
 1.539,
 p
 <
 0.001,
AOR
 =
 4.658).
As
 a
 follow-up
 analysis,
 we
 additionally
 examined
 whether
 the
observed
 effect
 of
 anxiety
 and
 impulsivity
 on
 muzzle
 grayness
 was
moderated
 by
 either
 the
 dog’s
 age
 or
 the
 dog’s
 sex.

 showed
 no
 statistically

 of
 either

 or

 on
 the
 effects
 of

(b

 and

for

 respectively).
 That
 is,
 the
 positive
 observed
 effects
of
 anxiety
 and
 impulsiveness
 on
 muzzle
 grayness
 were
 similar
 for
female
 and
 male
 dogs,
 and
 were
 the
 same
 regardless
 of
 the
 dog’s
age.

 Discussion
The
 primary
 purpose
 of
 this
 study
 was
 to
 examine
 the
 relation-
ship
 between
 owner-reported
 anxiety
 and
 impulsiveness
 in
 dogs
and
 premature
 muzzle
 graying.
 Results
 from
 the
 sample
 of
 400
 dogs
showed
 that,
 when
 controlling
 for
 the
 dogs’
 age,
 sex,
 spay/neuter
status,
 size,
 and
 presence
 of
 medical
 problems,
 both
 anxiety
 and
impulsivity
 were
 significantly
 associated
 with
 premature
 graying
in
 dogs
 between
 2
 and
 4
 years
 of
 age.
 Specifically,
 dogs
 present-
ing
 a
 greater
 extent
 of
 anxiety
 and
 impulsivity
 were
 more
 likely
 to
present
 premature
 muzzle
 grayness
 than
 dogs
 showing
 less
 anxi-
ety
 and
 impulsivity.
 Similarly,
 dogs’
 fear
 responses
 to
 three
 specific
stimuli—loud
 noises,
 and
 unfamiliar
 animals,
 and
 unfamiliar
 peo-
ple
 were
 significantly
 associated
 with
 increased
 muzzle
 grayness.
Among
 the
 other
 predictors
 that
 were
 examined,
 only
 the
 dogs’
 age
and
 sex
 significantly
 predicted
 premature
 grayness.
The
 significant
 deleterious
 effects
 of
 anxiety
 and
 impulsivity
on
 muzzle
 grayness
 are
 consistent
 with
 prior
 research
 using
 mice.
Viveros
 et
 al.
 (2007),
 for
 example,
 hypothesized
 that
 chronic
 hyper-
reactivity
 to
 stress,
 usually
 anxiety-based,
 led
 to
 immune
 system
disorder
 and
 premature
 aging
 in
 mice.
 Their
 research
 showed
 that
mice
 with
 higher
 levels
 of
 emotionality
 and
 anxiety
 ran
 a
 maze
more
 slowly
 than
 mice
 with
 lower
 levels
 of
 emotionality
 and
 anx-
iety.
 Similarly,
 a
 prior
 study
 by
 Viveros
 et
 al.
 (2001)
 that
 compared
these
 “fast”
 and
 “slow”
 mice
 using
 three
 behavioral
 tests
 (“hole-
board,”
 the
 “open
 field,”
 and
 the
 “plus-maze”)
 showed
 that
 the
hyper-emotional
 mice
 had
 impaired
 immune
 and
 neurobehavioral
functions,
 consistent
 with
 premature
 aging.
 Arck
 et
 al.
 (2003)
 found
parallel
 results
 in
 which
 psycho-emotional
 stress
 in
 mice
 was
 asso-
ciated
 with
 premature
 graying
 and
 hair
 loss.
Psycho-emotional
 stress
 in
 mice
 can
 affect
 hair
 growth
 via
neuro-endocrine
 and
 or
 neuro-immunological
 signaling
 pathways
(Peters
 et
 al.,
 2006).
 Vida
 et
 al.
 (2014)
 observed
 that
 anxiety
 is
 asso-
ciated
 with
 chronic
 oxidative
 stress
 and
 inflammation
 in
 brain
 cells,
and
 accelerates
 the
 rate
 of
 aging.
 Wu et
 al.
 (2014)
 posited
 a
 model
 of
premature
 aging
 in
 mice,
 in
 which
 animals
 show
 a
 poor
 response
to
 stress
 and
 high
 levels
 of
 anxiety,
 resulting
 in
 oxidative
 stress
in
 their
 immune
 cells
 and
 tissues.
 Wu  et
 al.’s
 study
 showed
 that
stress
 can
 induce
 alterations
 of
 skin
 pigmentary
 response,
 whereby
acute
 stress
 is
 associated
 with
 an
 increased
 turnover
 of
 serotonin
(5-Hydroxytriptamine;
 5-HT)
 and
 chronic
 stress,
 which
 then
 can
cause
 a
 decrease
 in
 5-HT
 in
 pigment
 cells.
 Thus,
 the
 serotoninergic
system
 appears
 to
 play
 a
 role
 in
 the
 regulation
 of
 stress-induced
depigmentation
 in
 mice.
The
 observed
 results
 in
 this
 study
 also
 are
 consistent
 with
 stud-
ies
 involving
 humans.
 Hassett
 et
 al.
 (2012)
 observed
 that
 chronic
pain
 can
 cause
 increased
 stress
 and
 premature
 cellular
 aging,
including
 premature
 hair
 graying.
 Similarly,
 Suresh
 and
 Yashvant
(2015)
 found
 auto-immune
 diseases,
 vitamin
 deficiencies,
 and
chronic
 stress
 to
 be
 associated
 with
 premature
 graying.
 In
 a
 study
of
 over
 6000
 adult
 human
 males,
 premature
 graying
 was
 signifi-
cantly
 associated
 with
 environmental
 stressors
 in
 lifestyle
 such
 as
smoking
 and
 obesity
 (Shin
 et
 al.,
 2015).
In
 the
 present
 study,
 no
 significant
 moderating
 effects
 for
dog
 age
 or
 sex
 were
 observed
 on
 the
 relationship
 between
 anxi-
ety/impulsivity
 and
 muzzle
 grayness.
 That
 is,
 although
 older
 dogs
were
 significantly
 more
 likely
 to
 present
 graying
 than
 younger
dogs,
 and
 female
 dogs
 were
 more
 likely
 to
 present
 graying
 than
male
 dogs,
 the
 relationship
 between
 anxiety/impulsivity
 and
 muz-
zle
 grayness
 appears
 to
 be
 consistent
 across
 the
 varied
 ages
 of
 the
dogs,
 and
 also
 consistent
 for
 both
 female
 and
 male
 dogs.
 For
 age,
in
 particular,
 this
 is
 notable,
 as
 it
 suggests
 the
 deleterious
 effects
of
 anxiety/impulsivity
 are
 just
 as
 strong
 among
 younger
 dogs
 as
among
 older
 dogs.
Because
 it
 is
 generally
 known
 that
 participation
 in
 leisure
 activ-
ities
 and
 sports
 can
 reduce
 stress
 and
 anxiety
 in
 humans
 (Penedo
and
 Dahn,
 2005),
 we  anticipated
 that
 participation
 in
 organized
or
 competitive
 activities
 among
 dogs
 might
 decrease
 propensity
towards
 muzzle
 grayness.
 The
 results,
 however,
 failed
 to
 discern
any
 association
 between
 such
 participation
 and
 muzzle
 grayness.
Perhaps
 there
 are
 further
 distinctions
 between
 specific
 types
 of
activities
 that
 might
 result
 in
 predictive
 relationships.
 The
 sample
sizes
 for
 specific
 activities
 in
 the
 present
 study,
 however,
 were
 too
small
 to
 facilitate
 such
 analyses.
A
 notable
 auxiliary
 finding
 of
 the
 present
 study
 was
 that
 female
dogs
 were
 significantly
 more
 likely
 than
 male
 dogs
 to
 present
 pre-
mature
 muzzle
 graying.
 This
 is
 a
 finding
 not
 observed
 (or
 even
investigated)
 in
 prior
 studies
 of
 graying.
Surprisingly,
 only
 about
 20%
 of
 the
 dogs
 in
 various
 set-
tings
 met
 the
 criteria
 for
 participation.
 Many
 dogs
 either
 had
 a
white/cream/gray
 muzzle
 or
 were
 under
 one
 year
 old,
 and
 thus
were
 excluded
 from
 participation.
 Although
 the
 exclusion
 of
 older
dogs
 was
 an
 explicit
 delimitation
 of
 this
 study—as
 the
 purpose
was
 to
 examine
 premature
 muzzle
 graying,
 rather
 than
 age-related

graying—the
 exclusion
 of
 dogs
 with
 light-colored
 muzzles
 was
 an
unfortunate
 (but
 necessary)
 limitation.
 The
 results
 of
 this
 study
can
 be
 generalized
 only
 to
 populations
 of
 dogs
 without
 natu-
rally
 light-colored
 muzzles.
 Additionally,
 the
 instrument
 used
 to
assess
 anxiety
 and
 impulsivity
 was
 a
 new,
 researcher-created
 tool.
Although
 construct
 validity
 evidence
 was
 observed
 with
 the
 fit
 of
the
 measurement
 model
 and
 with
 correlations
 with
 other
 variables,
and
 the
 construct
 also
 showed
 good
 internal
 consistency
 reliabil-
ity,
 further
 studies
 using
 this
 instrument
 are
 necessary
 to
 obtain
additional
 evidence
 for
 reliability
 and
 validity.
 Similarly,
 although
good
 inter-rater
 reliability
 of
 the
 individuals
 assessing
 muzzle
 gray-
ness
 was
 demonstrated,
 additional
 variability
 may
 have
 occurred
if
 other
 raters
 had
 been
 used.
One
 practical
 implication
 of
 the
 findings
 of
 this
 study
 involves
the
 possibility
 of
 using
 observations
 of
 muzzle
 grayness
 in
 a
 diag-
nostic
 manner
 to
 address
 anxiety,
 impulsivity,
 or
 fear
 issues.
 That
 is,
if
 dog
 professionals
 (veterinarians,
 applied
 behaviorists,
 dog
 train-
ers,
 etc.)
 are
 able
 to
 note
 premature
 graying
 in
 their
 assessments
and
 or
 training,
 then
 these
 dogs
 might
 be
 assessed
 more
 thoroughly
for
 anxiety/impulsivity/fear
 problems
 and,
 if
 necessary,
 started
 on
behavior
 modification
 programs
 earlier
 in
 their
 developmental
 life
stages.
 Additionally,
 owners
 could
 be
 educated
 to
 monitor
 for
 pre-
mature
 graying
 in
 young
 dogs.
When
 premature
 graying
 is
 evident,
 early
 intervention
 pro-
grams
 then
 could
 be
 initiated,
 whereby
 owners
 are
 assisted
with
 teaching
 their
 dogs
 coping
 skills/default
 behavior,
 provid-
ing
 their
 dogs
 with
 mental
 stimulation
 and
 facilitating
 their
 dogs’
ability
 to
 read
 body
 language
 to
 help
 alleviate
 some
 of
 the
 anx-
iety/impulsivity/fear
 problems
 their
 dogs
 may
 experience
 and
thereby
 promote
 a
 healthy,
 high-quality
 life.
 Working
 in
 tandem
with
 veterinarians,
 applied
 animal
 behaviorists
 and
 professional
dog
 trainers
 may
 find
 increased
 success
 in
 addressing
 some
 of
 these
problems
 in
 dogs.
Future
 research
 may
 include
 replicating
 this
 study
 using
 a
 stan-
dardized
 tool
 for
 anxiety
 and
 impulsivity.
 Temperament
 testing
 of
the
 dogs
 may
 also
 be
 of
 value.

 Conclusion
One
 practical
 implication
 of
 the
 findings
 of
 this
 study
 involves
the
 possibility
 of
 using
 observations
 of
 muzzle
 grayness
 (assessed
in
 dogs
 without
 white,
 cream,
 gray
 or
 merle-colored
 muzzles)
 in
 a
diagnostic
 manner
 to
 address
 anxiety,
 impulsivity,
 or
 fear
 issues.
Young
 dogs
 with
 owner-reported
 anxiety
 and
 impulsivity
 issues
showed
 significant
 values
 related
 to
 premature
 graying
 in
 the
 muz-
zle
 line.
 There
 is
 a
 need
 for
 future
 research
 studies
 to
 develop
behavioral
 interventions
 for
 dogs
 with
 anxiety
 and
 impulsivity
problems.
