Abstract
Objective: Depression is usually treated with antidepressants, psychotherapy, or both. In this study, we examined the extent
to which individuals with depression receive minimally adequate treatment with regard to the use of antidepressants and
psychotherapy.
Method: Using population-based administrative data, we identified individuals with inpatient or outpatient diagnoses of
depression and tracked their use of publicly funded mental health services within a 12-month period. We used mixed-effects
logistic regression to assess the influence of patient-level characteristics and physician-level variations on the receipt of
minimally adequate treatment.
Results: A total of 108 101 individuals, predominantly women (65%) and urban residents (89%), were diagnosed with
depression in 2010–2011. Of these, 13% received minimally adequate counseling/psychotherapy with higher proportions
observed among men, younger individuals, and urban residents. In contrast, there were more who received minimally ade-
quate antidepressant therapy (48%), with women, older individuals, and rural residents having the highest proportions.
Overall, about 53% received either type of treatment, and the pattern of use was similar to that of antidepressant therapy.
Mixed-effects logistic regression results indicate that these factors remain independent predictors of the receipt of minimally
adequate depression care. Significant practice variations also exist, which determine patients’ receipt of minimally adequate
care, particularly with respect to counseling or psychotherapy.
Conclusions: Only about half of those with depression receive either minimally adequate counseling/psychotherapy or
minimally adequate antidepressant therapy. Disparities also persist, affecting mostly men and younger individuals. A multi-
factorial approach is needed to improve access to and reduce variations in receipt of minimally adequate depression care.

Clinical Implications
�
Existing structures, policies, and practices need to be
evaluated to further understand why almost half of the
individuals diagnosed with depression do not receive
minimally adequate treatment.
�
Additional supports and alternative modes of acces-
sing depression treatment are needed for younger
individuals who are most at risk of not receiving mini-
mally adequate care.
�
Practice variations need to be reduced to minimize
their impact on patients’ odds of receiving minimally
adequate treatment for depression.
Limitations
�
Services that are not publicly covered were not
included in the analyses.
�
Study results may have understated income-related
disparities.
�
Use of antidepressant therapy was examined using pre-
scription fills; study results may have underestimated
prescribing practices and overestimated actual use.
One in 20 individuals, each year, experience major depres-
sive disorders (MDDs).1,2 Many remain untreated, even
though evidence-based treatments, such as psychological
and antidepressant therapies,3,4 exist. Contrary to popular
belief, most of those with depression actually receive treat-
ment exclusively from general practitioners (GPs).5
Estimates of the percentage of people with untreated
depression vary widely, ranging from 16% to 84% (median,
56%).6 The treatment gap is high even in largely developed
regions such as Europe (45%) and the Americas (57%).6 In
Canada, analysis of recent data indicates that 28% (95% CI
24% to 32%) of the population with probable MDD self-
reported not receiving any help for their condition.7 The gap
increases to 37% (95% CI 33% to 41%) if we count only
those with probable MDD who self-reported not receiving
mental health care from hospitals or other health care pro-
fessionals such as psychiatrists, GPs, psychologists, nurses,
social workers, and counselors.7
Some of the treatment gap is due to personal circum-
stances, such as not knowing how to get help or not
having confidence in the health care system, and to health
system factors, such as services being unavailable or inac-
cessible.8 There are individuals, however, who overcome
these challenges and manage to put their feet within the
door of the formal health care system, only to contend
with another issue—poor or undertreatment by any pub-
lished standard.
Studies in North America9-21 suggest that 30% to 79%
(median, 52%) of individuals with MDD or mood disorders
who undergo treatment receive treatment that does not meet
the minimum threshold for adequacy. In Europe, recent stud-
ies22-28 estimate the proportion of those who receive poor
treatment to be between 24% and 75% (median, 60%).
The variation in these estimates is likely due to differ-
ences in definitions, population characteristics, sample size,
and methods. Despite the variations, however, the overall
evidence still highlights that a large number of people
receive inadequate treatment for depression. Addressing this
gap is important, given the huge societal impact of mental
illness29 in general and MDD in particular. Most impor-
tantly, closing the gap will improve patient outcomes.30,31

 An essential step toward addressing the gap is under-
standing its magnitude. Canada, in this respect, does not
appear to be at par with other developed countries. At the
time of writing, we are aware of only 2 published studies that
quantified the extent of the gap; one based on data from a
2002 national survey14 and another based on a more recent
provincial survey.19 Both used self-reported data, which are
susceptible to social desirability32 and recall biases.33 Stud-
ies comparing survey and administrative data show that self-
reported data substantially undercount people with mental
health conditions34 while at the same time overcount the
frequency of health care use,35 particularly among individ-
uals experiencing severe symptoms.36,37
In this population-based data linkage study, we aim to
contribute to the current understanding of the gaps and dis-
parities in depression care in publicly funded health systems.
Specifically, we address the following questions:
1.
How often do individuals receive minimally ade-
quate care for MDD?
2.
Does receipt of minimally adequate care for depres-
sion differ by variables such as age, sex, income,
geographic location, and practising physicians?
Methods
Data Sources
We examined individual-level health administrative data
from virtually everyone in the province of British Columbia
(BC). Anonymized data were extracted from multiple data-
bases (Table 1) linked by unique study identifiers.
The BC Ministry of Health, Data Stewardship Commit-
tee, and Vital Statistics Agency granted data access permis-
sions. The University of British Columbia Behavioral
Research Ethics Board provided ethics approval.
Study Cohort
We examined data from 3 fiscal years (FYs) to ensure that
each individual in our cohort had 12 months of health service
history and 12 months of follow-up. We ascertained cases in
FY2010/11 and used FY2009/10 and FY2011/12 as look-
back and follow-up periods. This configuration enabled us
to determine whether those first diagnosed on 31 May 2010,
for example, had a 12-month history (31 May 2009 to 30
May 2010) of any of the diagnoses listed in our exclusion
criteria and also if they received treatment within 12 months
(31 May 2010 to 30 May 2011) following initial diagnosis
(Figure 1).
To identify study cohort members, we first extracted
records of individuals with MDD (ICD-9 296, 296.2,
296.3, and 311 and ICD-10 F32, F33, and F39) from physi-
cian claims, hospital separations, and community mental
health service data files in FY2010/11. We considered only
the most responsible diagnosis. When individuals showed up
in more than one database, we retrieved the earliest record
and marked that as the index date. We removed those with
diagnoses of schizophrenia or bipolar disorders (ICD-9 295
and 296.4 to 296.7, ICD-10 F25 and F29 to F31) between
FY2009/10 and 2011/12.
As we were interested only in individuals who initiated
treatment during FY2010/11, we excluded those who had a
12-month history of any mood disorder diagnoses (ICD-9
296 and 311 and code 50B, ICD-10 F3x). In addition, we
ensured that the cohort consisted only of those eligible to
receive publicly funded health services by removing anyone
with yearly registration in the provincial health services plan
of less than 275 days between 2009 and 2011. Last, we
excluded those who were younger than 19 years, died during
the 12-month follow-up, or had missing data on sex, place of
residence, and income (Figure 2).
The use of algorithms based on ICD9/10 diagnoses for
MDD case detection is common in health administrative data
analyses.44 In our study, we used diagnostic codes similar to
those used by a Canadian surveillance system,45 which
shows good validity (sensitivity, 81.1%; specificity,
94.8%; positive predictive value, 79.6%; negative predictive
value, 95.2%) based on validation work conducted in several
Canadian provinces.46 Analysis of BC data from the valida-
tion study46 yielded comparable validity indices.47
Outcome Measures
We constructed indicators to measure minimally ade-
quate counseling/psychotherapy (MACP), minimally
adequate antidepressant therapy (MAAT), and minimally
adequate treatment.

 MACP assesses receipt of �4 counseling or psychother-
apy sessions in individual or group settings. The cutpoint
was adapted from similar studies that analyzed administra-
tive databases15,48 and reflects a realistic threshold in BC,
where the publicly funded health system easily allows up to
4 counseling claims per patient, annually.49 Only paid claims
specifically designated as counseling or psychotherapy,
regardless of duration, were counted in creating MACP.
MAAT measures whether antidepressant prescriptions
were filled with �84 supply days. We used the World Health
Organization’s Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical classifica-
tion code (N06Axxx) to identify antidepressant fills. The
cutpoint was adapted from previous studies15,48 and corre-
sponds to the 12-week acute treatment phase50 during which
individuals initiating antidepressant therapy are expected to
be on medication. Because the 84-day period is covered
in many cases by single fills (such as a prescription for
90 days), MAAT was created by counting only the supply
days, which is considered sufficient for investigating medi-
cation use in shorter time frames.51
The last indicator measures receipt of either MACP or
MAAT.
These indicators were previously examined within the
acute treatment period.15,48 In our study, we used a
12-month period to capture services that take longer to access
in BC (such as publicly covered psychotherapy/counseling).
Explanatory Variables
Our explanatory variables include age, sex, income, and
place of residence. As more recent household-level income
data are not available, we used Statistics Canada’s neigh-
bourhood income quintiles. We coded the patient’s place
of residence as rural if the second character of their postal
code was zero and urban for everyone else.
We created aggregated diagnostic groups (ADGs) follow-
ing the Johns Hopkins adjusted clinical groups case-mix
system.52 We used counts of major ADGs (mADGs) as a
measure of health status, with higher counts signifying
greater morbidity and clinical complexity.52
Because BC does not have a formal rostering of patients
with physicians, we adapted a method of linking individual
patients to a major source of care (MSOC).53 First, patients
were assigned to physicians who charged the annual mental
health planning (MHP) fee code. When MHP was claimed
more than once in a year, we assigned the patient to the
physician with the earliest MHP claim. Then, we designated
as MSOCs those physicians who were visited exclusively by
patients during follow-up. Failing these 2 approaches, we
assigned patients to physicians who provided at least two-
thirds of the follow-up care. The remaining patients who
could not be assigned were given the same 5-digit MSOC
number.
Statistical Analysis
We used descriptive statistics to summarize the cohort’s
characteristics. We also provided counts and proportions for
the 3 indicators (MACP, MAAT, minimally adequate treat-
ment), broken down by demographic and clinical character-
istics. To determine if the indicators were associated with the
explanatory variables and physician-level variations, we ran

 mixed-effects logistic regression, with patient demographic
and clinical characteristics entered as fixed factors and phy-
sician study identifiers as random effects. We used the
adjusted odds ratios from the models as measures of the
magnitude of association between the indicators and expla-
natory variables. Physician-level variations, on the other
hand, were quantified using intracluster correlation coeffi-
cients (ICC). Higher ICCs were interpreted as indicative of
greater physician variations. We also calculated median odds
ratios (MORs) to complement the ICCs, which have a
limited interpretation in a mixed-effects logistic regres-
sion.54 In the context of our study, MOR refers to the median
of the distribution of all ORs formed when a physician with
higher odds is compared with another who has lower odds of
providing care. When the odds of providing care vary sub-
stantially across physicians, the OR distribution will be
wider and its median further from the value of 1. An MOR
¼ 1 could thus mean that all physicians are equally likely to
provide a particular type of service, whereas an MOR >1
implies that some physicians are more likely than other

 physicians to provide a specific type of care. This intuitive
interpretation of the MOR along with its being in the same
scale as the other model ORs facilitates comparison of the
various factors that influence receipt of minimally adequate
care. Further details on the MOR can be found elsewhere.55
We used SAS/SQL software V 9.4 to link and manage
multiple databases. We used xtmixed (with 30 integration
points) and xtmrho routines running under Stata Version
13.1 to generate the model results.
Results
The number of individuals who received treatment for mood
disorders in FY2010/11 was 275 575, representing 6% of the
total population in BC, based on a 2011 population estimate
of 4 576 000.56 The majority of these individuals received
mental health care only from GPs (77%). The rest visited
psychiatrists exclusively (8%), GPs or specialists (including
psychiatrists; 14.5%), and other specialists (excluding psy-
chiatrists; 0.5%).
The final cohort included 108 101 individuals, represent-
ing 3% of the BC population who were older than 19 years in
2011. These individuals who initiated some form of
treatment for depression in 2011 were predominantly women
between the ages of 36 and 55 years (41%) and urban resi-
dents. Higher concentrations were found in the lower income
groups, particularly in the lowest quintile.
Close to half of the cohort members had no mADGs,
while a smaller proportion had 3 or more mADGs. Less than
1% (n ¼ 1003) were hospitalized with a mental health reason
as the most responsible diagnosis. About 57.7% received �1
counseling/psychotherapy session, 58.4% filled �1 anti-
depressant prescription, and up to 82.5% received either
treatment.
The median number of mental health–related physician
visits was 2, and they were mostly visits to GPs; the majority
(P75) had no psychiatry visits. The median number of coun-
seling/psychotherapy visits was 1, provided mostly by GPs;
the majority (P75) had no counseling/psychotherapy visits to
psychiatrists (Table 2).
MACP
A small percentage (13%) of the cohort received MACP.
Differences by sex, age, residence, and health status were
present and persisted even after adjustment for other factors

 in a multivariable regression model. Men had slightly higher
odds than women of receiving MACP. Individuals between
the ages of 19 and 35 years had greater odds of receiving
MACP compared with older adults (46–55 years), whose
odds were considerably greater than those older than
75 years. Rural residents had lower odds of MACP than
those living in urban areas. Patients with higher mADG
counts had greater odds of receiving MACP.
The provision of MACP appeared to vary substantially by
physicians. Model results suggest that about 33% of the
variation that cannot be explained by any of the fixed factors
were due to practice variations. The MOR also indicates that
some physicians had about 3 times the odds of other physi-
cians (MOR ¼ 3.36) in providing MACP. Furthermore,
MOR suggests that the odds of receiving MACP was con-
tingent more on which physicians were visited than on
patient characteristics such as age, sex, and so forth.
MAAT
A little less than half of the cohort (48%) received MAAT.
Differences by sociodemographic and health factors were
present (Table 3), which also persisted even after adjusting
for other factors in a multivariable regression model. Men
seemed less likely than women to receive MAAT. Individ-
uals between the ages of 19 and 35 years had substantially
lower odds than older adults (46 years and older). Rural
residents had higher odds of receiving MAAT than those
living in urban areas, and patients with greater mADGs had
greater odds of receiving MAAT. The residual variation that
could be attributed to variations in physician practice was
remarkably lower (9%) than that observed for MACP.
Minimally Adequate Treatment
A little more than half (53%) of the cohort received mini-
mally adequate treatment. Higher proportions were observed
in women, older individuals, higher income quintiles, and
residents of rural areas (Table 3). These differences
remained even after adjusting for other factors in a multi-
variable model. The odds of receiving minimally adequate
treatment were lower in men than women. Individuals
between the ages of 19 and 35 years had lower odds than
older adults. The odds for patients in the lowest income

 quintile were lower than the odds for patients in the third
quintile, whose odds, in turn, were lower than patients in the
highest income quintile. The residual variation in the receipt
of minimally adequate treatment that could be attributed to
physician practice variations was similar to that of MAAT.
Discussion
We conducted a population-based, data linkage study to
determine how often individuals diagnosed with MDD
receive minimally adequate care and to measure disparities
associated with various factors. We found that about half of
the individuals diagnosed with depression receive minimally
adequate care, mostly in the form of antidepressant therapy.
Furthermore, whether patients receive these services
depends, to varying degrees, on their sex, age, income level,
health status, hospitalization for mental health reasons, place
of residence, and the specific physicians they visit to seek
care.
Our finding that 53% receive minimally adequate depres-
sion care appears low compared with a US study that
reported a proportion of up 70% in a Medicaid-enrolled
population.15 The proportion of individuals who receive
MACP (13%) in our study is also surprisingly low compared
with 62% who receive similar care found in the US study.15
However, our study found a higher proportion of individuals
who receive MAAT (48% compared with 29.5% in the US
study).
These contrasting numbers are explained partly by some
methodological differences between our study and the US
study.15 For example, we used a 12-month period for ascer-
taining cases and for follow-up compared with 12-week
look-back and 144-day follow-up periods used in the US
study. We used population-based data in BC, where depres-
sion treatment is provided mostly in primary care, whereas
the US study examined Medicaid-enrollees receiving treat-
ment in mental health specialty care settings, where the fre-
quency of receiving minimally adequate treatment tends to
be high.12 Our cohort also has fewer individuals who were
hospitalized for mental health reasons (0.93% compared
with 15.7% in the US study). It is unlikely, nevertheless, that
the marked differences in the levels of use are entirely due to
methodological differences.
Indeed, similar levels of minimally adequate depression
care have been reported in at least 1 Canadian province. A
Quebec study,57 for instance, found that up to 13% of its
survey respondents meeting criteria for MDD receive
MACP. In addition, the study reported that 46% of its
respondents receive MAAT and that 52% receive either type
of treatment. We note, however, that the Quebec study
defined MACP as receipt of �12 consultations for mental
health reasons in the previous year plus �1 recommended
psychotherapy and MAAT as receipt of �1 prescription for
antidepressants plus �3 medical visits.
It is also worth noting that the minimally adequate depres-
sion care received by the majority in our cohort is mainly
through antidepressant therapy. Several reasons could
account for this. First, most individuals with depression
receive treatment in primary care, where antidepressant ther-
apy is more available and appears to be the treatment of
choice.58 Second, services provided by physicians constitute
the majority, if not all, of the publicly funded counseling/
psychotherapy services, and accessing these services is
challenging because of significant wait times.59 Third, some
fee-for-service physicians are predisposed to regard the
dispensation of antidepressants as an opportunity to reduce
time spent on patient counseling60 and consequently increase
the number of billable visits. BC instituted policies in
2008 to curb this propensity through financial incentives.61
However, we are not aware of any studies, to date, that
demonstrate its impact on the provision of counseling/
psychotherapy.
Another notable finding is the lower odds of receiving
minimally adequate treatment overall among younger indi-
viduals. This disparity, in addition to the large gap in mini-
mally adequate care, underscores the need to enhance access
to counseling/psychotherapy or other forms of treatment for
this age group. Given existing concerns about the lack of
efficacy of and the adverse events linked to antidepressant
therapy in the younger population,62 it is difficult to discuss
the expanded role antidepressants could have in addressing
the considerable gap and disparity in treatment adequacy.
We also would like to highlight results that indicate the
presence of substantial practice variations in the provision
of MACP. Much of these variations could be explained by
differences between mental health specialists and family
physicians in the inclination and ability to deliver these
services. It could also be due to differences in familiarity
with treatment algorithms for depression and amount of
practice time devoted to mental health.63 Notwithstanding
all of these potential sources of variation, our results high-
light the need for a higher level of consistency in providing
these services since most patients with depression receive
treatment from physicians and certain types of brief psy-
chological therapies are known to be effective in primary
care settings.64-66
Finally, our 6% estimate of the treated prevalence of
mood disorders is slightly higher than the national estimate
of 5.4% (95% CI 4.9 to 5.8).1 This is partly because our
estimate is based on the entire population, unlike the national
survey, which drew samples from individuals who are at
least 15 years of age. The slight discrepancy could also be
due to physician coding error in the claims database or to
residual social desirability bias32 in the survey.34
Our study adds to the body of knowledge on minimally
adequate care for depression, especially in Canada where
evidence is scarce. Our data sources do not share the same
weaknesses as self-reported data, and as such, our results
complement findings from existing literature currently dom-
inated by survey studies. Like other studies, nevertheless,
some limitations need to be kept in mind when considering
our results.

 First, case identification was done through ICD-9/10
codes, which, although accurate, are still associated with
misclassification errors.47 Second, we were unable to exam-
ine the appropriateness of counseling/psychotherapy pro-
vided by physicians as our data do not allow us to classify
the type of counseling/psychotherapy provided. Third, we
were unable to track counseling/psychotherapy services that
are not publicly covered and not provided by physicians.
These services, which are usually provided by professional
counselors and psychologists, are not captured in the data-
bases we examined. As a result, we may have underesti-
mated the overall extent to which the population receives
counseling/psychotherapy (particularly among high-income
groups who could pay out-of-pocket costs for these services)
and probably understated the degree of income-related dis-
parity. Analysis of recent Canadian data indicates that some
of those with probable MDD had visited psychologists either
exclusively (3.4%, 95% CI 1.8 to 4.9) or in conjunction with
physicians (14.8%, 95% CI 11.0 to 18.5).7 Fourth, our phar-
macotherapy results were based on filled prescriptions,
which could overestimate actual use and underestimate pre-
scribing practices. Fifth, because many of the individuals in
our cohort could not be assigned to a specific major source of
care, our models may have underestimated the magnitude of
practice variations. Sixth, our results may not generalize to
other jurisdictions because of the peculiarities of the BC
health system. Last, our analyses are based only on indivi-
duals who receive a diagnosis from the formal health care
system. If everyone with MDD could be accounted for, the
magnitude of the gap in minimally adequate treatment for
depression would be much higher than what our results show.
Conclusion
Only about half of those with depression receive either
MACP or MAAT. Disparities also persist, affecting
mostly men and younger individuals. A multifactorial
approach is therefore needed to improve access to and
reduce variations in the receipt of minimally adequate
depression care.
