 INTRODUCTION
Weight loss is a non-specific symptom 
posing a diagnostic challenge to clinicians 
in non-specialist settings such as primary 
care. It can be associated with several 
cancer and non-cancer conditions.1 In 
relation to cancer, two main diagnostic 
groupings exist: patients with additional 
clinical features, such as haemoptysis, 
which can focus diagnostic efforts; and 
patients without such a pointer in whom, 
if cancer is suspected, the clinician must 
consider several possible sites.2 
There are no international or national 
clinical guidelines to support primary 
care physicians in how to respond to or 
investigate patients who present with weight 
loss, although several clinical reviews have 
suggested different approaches, most 
commonly in older populations.1,3–6 In 
the UK, guidance for suspected cancer 
from the National Institute for Health and 
Care Excellence (NICE) reported weight 
loss to be a feature of seven cancers in 
primary care, citing positive predictive 
values (PPVs) of 0.4–3.0%, and a cumulative 
PPV of 7.1% across all cancer sites, a 
figure considerably above the 3% threshold 
used by NICE in formulating their urgent 
investigation guidance.7 The methods used 
by NICE will have incorrectly estimated 
the true PPV for weight loss, because for 
several cancer sites no evidence could be 
found: summary PPVs for each cancer site 
were added together, meaning any possible 
contribution to the total PPV from a cancer 
site as yet unreported was omitted. 
People who have lost more weight are 
more likely to have cancer than those who 
have lost less,8 but almost all evidence on this 
comes from specialist care.1 Furthermore, 
weight loss has been previously considered 
as a feature of advanced cancer only, 
although reports about weight loss and 
stage at diagnosis give conflicting results. 
Studies of colorectal, pancreatic, and lung 
cancer have reported that even people 
with early-stage cancer may present with 
weight loss,9–11 and yet other data show no 
relationship between weight loss and stage 
or mortality from colorectal cancer
.12
It is also unclear whether weight loss 
might occur in the period immediately 
before a diagnosis is established, or be a 
symptom that occurs well before cancer 
is manifest. In one study, patients with 
pancreatic cancer had a similar body mass 
index (BMI) to controls without cancer, 
suggesting weight loss has not continued 
for long.13 Other evidence, however, 
suggests that some patients experience 
symptoms for some time before consulting 
with insidious weight loss, misattributed to 
normal weight fluctuations due to changes 
in diet and exercise.14,15
It is possible that non-specialist doctors

Abstract
Background
Weight loss is a non-specific cancer symptom 
for which there are no clinical guidelines about 
investigation in primary care. 
Aim
To summarise the available evidence on weight 
loss as a clinical feature of cancer in patients 
presenting to primary care. 
Design and setting
A diagnostic test accuracy review and meta-
analysis. 
Method
Studies reporting 2 × 2 diagnostic accuracy data 
for weight loss (index test) in adults presenting 
to primary care and a subsequent diagnosis 
of cancer (reference standard) were included. 
QUADAS-2 was used to assess study quality. 
Sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratios, 
and positive predictive values were calculated, 
and a bivariate meta-analysis performed. 
Results
A total of 25 studies were included, with 23 (92%) 
using primary care records. Of these, 20 (80%) 
defined weight loss as a physician’s coding of the 
symptom; the remainder collected data directly. 
One defined unexplained weight loss using 
objective measurements. Positive associations 
between weight loss and cancer were found 
for 10 cancer sites: prostate, colorectal, lung, 
gastro-oesophageal, pancreatic, non-Hodgkin’s 
lymphoma, ovarian, myeloma, renal tract, and 
biliary tree. Sensitivity ranged from 2% to 47%, 
and specificity from 92% to 99%, across cancer 
sites. The positive predictive value for cancer in 
male and female patients with weight loss for 
all age groups ≥60 years exceeded the 3% risk 
threshold that current UK guidance proposes for 
further investigation.
Conclusion
A primary care clinician’s decision to code for 
weight loss is highly predictive of cancer
. For such 
patients, urgent referral pathways are justified to 
investigate for cancer across multiple sites.

Weight loss as a predictor of cancer 
in primary care: 
a systematic review and meta-analysis
e311  British Journal of General Practice, May 2018
 do not recognise weight loss as a potential 
symptom of cancer and omit investigation 
until other symptoms occur. Patients 
with pancreatic cancer with weight loss 
as their first symptom had the longest 
time to diagnosis and poorest survival.16 
This may reflect the lack of guidelines on 
investigating weight loss, and the lack of a 
clear pathway to refer patients with isolated 
weight loss for investigation.
The objectives of this systematic review 
were, first, to examine the diagnostic value 
of weight loss — alone and in combination 
with other clinical features for cancer in 
primary care patients — and, second, to 
examine how the predictive value of weight 
loss varies by cancer type, cancer stage, 
sex, and age.
METHOD 
Protocol and registration
A protocol was registered with PROSPERO 
(review number CRD42016038963).17 The 
authors followed standard Cochrane 
methodology.18 Reporting followed PRISMA, 
adapted to suit a systematic review and 
meta-analysis of diagnostic studies.19
Patient involvement
A survey of patients with experience of a 
cancer diagnosis informed the choice of 
methodology.
Eligibility criteria
Studies were included if 2 × 2 diagnostic 
accuracy data could be extracted for the 
symptom of weight loss and cancer in adults 
(≥18 years) presenting to primary care. No 
restrictions were placed on the definition of 
weight loss. A cancer diagnosis of any type 
or stage was included if confirmed by the 
cancer registry, histology, the general practice 
electronic record, or by another reliable source 
judged appropriate by the researchers.20–24 A 
cancer diagnosis within 5 years of the weight 
loss was permitted, although only one study 
extended beyond 2 years.
Information sources and search strategy
The electronic databases EMBASE (OvidSP) 
(1974 to 23 October 2015), the Science 
Citation Index & Conference Proceedings 
Citation Index (Web of Science Core 
Collection) (1946–present), and MEDLINE 
(OvidSP) (1946–present) were searched 
on 25 October 2015. Weight loss terms, 
general symptom terms, and cancer terms 
were used, along with primary care setting 
terms to identify potentially relevant studies 
(further information available from the 
authors on request). Duplicates, studies in 
non-human animals, case reports, letters, 
comment articles, and editorials were 
excluded. No language limits were applied. 
The reference lists of retrieved reviews and 
all included studies were checked and a 
’Related articles’ PubMed search conducted. 
All principal investigators were contacted to 
request additional relevant data. 
Study selection and data extraction
Two review authors independently screened 
all titles and abstracts, assessed full-text 
articles for those deemed relevant based 
on title and abstract, and where a decision 
could not be made at screening, and 
extracted data from eligible studies using 
an extraction guide refined after initial 
piloting. A third review author resolved any 
discrepancies, leading to 59 exclusions 
following full-text review.
Quality assessment
QUADAS-2 
was 
used 
to 
assess 
methodological quality.25 QUADAS-2 items 
were weighted to address key potential 
biases (further information available from the 
authors on request).
Analyses
Sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood 
ratios (PLRs), and diagnostic odds ratios 
(DOR) were calculated with corresponding 
95% confidence intervals (CIs).18,26 Review 
Manager 5.3 was used to produce forest 
plots to visually show the heterogeneity in 
sensitivity and specificity across primary 
studies, and to plot sensitivity and specificity 
estimates from each study in receiver 
operating characteristic (ROC) space. A 
bivariate meta-analysis model was used to 
calculate pooled estimates for sensitivity, 
specificity, and positive likelihood ratios 
(PLRs)27 for subgroups including four or 
more studies, using Stata (version 13.1).28–33 
Positive predictive values (PPVs) were 
How this fits in 
No systematic review and meta-analysis 
has examined the association between 
weight loss and cancer in primary 
care populations. The sensitivity of 
unexpected weight loss for cancer is low, 
demonstrating that many primary care 
patients with cancer do not experience 
weight loss. Conversely, the specificity 
is high. Patients aged ≥60 years with 
unexpected weight loss have >3% chance 
of having cancer in one of 10 cancer sites. 
Investment in rapid diagnostic pathways to 
urgently investigate weight loss across a 
number of cancer sites is justified.
British Journal of General Practice, May 2018  e312
 calculated using Bayes’s theorem by 
multiplying the PLR by the prior odds.32 
Prior odds were derived using the cancer 
incidence (the pre-test probability) for the 
age ranges included in each study.7,34 To give 
a percentage risk of any cancer, cumulative 
PPVs were calculated by adding together 
PPVs for each tumour site, and presented 
by age group and sex.7 The highest and 
lowest cumulative PPVs were calculated 
by adding the PPVs calculated with the 
highest and lowest likelihood ratios (LRs) 
respectively. 
The authors conducted a planned 
bivariate meta-analysis of the predictive 
value of weight loss by individual cancer 
site, cancer stage, sex, and age group. 
Two sensitivity analyses were pre-specified 
based on QUADAS-2 assessment: one 
including studies with a low risk of bias, 
and a second including studies where the 
risk of bias in only one domain was high. 
Investigation of publication bias in diagnostic 
accuracy studies is not recommended by 
Cochrane, and so this was not assessed.35–37
RESULTS 
Study characteristics 
Twenty-five included studies were published 
between 1994 and 2015. One study was 
conducted in the US and all others in the 
UK. The sample size ranged from 398 to 
2 140 194 participants, median 43 791 
(interquartile 
range = 8476–1 013 262). 
Table 1 details each included study. 
Data source
Eight studies used routinely collected 
electronic health record data from The 
Health Improvement Network (THIN) 
database,8,38–44 seven from the QCancer® 
database,22,23,45–49 and four from the Clinical 
Practice Research Datalink (CPRD).50–53 
These studies used the symptom and 
diagnosis codes physicians use; uncoded 
free-text information from the notes 
was not accessed. Three studies used a 
combination of written and electronic GP 
records, coded using the International 
Classification of Primary Care-2, blinded 
to the cancer outcome.54–56 Two used 
structured patient questionnaires.57,58 One 
included data from three sources: patient 
questionnaire, patient telephone interview, 
and the GP record.59
Study design
In all, 13 case–control studies and 12 cohort 
studies were included. The ratio of cases to 
controls ranged from 1:1 to 1:10.8,43,44,50– 
59 
Control patients were matched for 
age,8,44,50–58 sex,8,44,50–58 GP practice,8,43,44,50–56 
and consultation year,44 by using adjacency 
on the GP register,57 using Health Care 
Financing Administration lists,58 at random 
using the electronic record, 8,43,44,50–56 after 
attending ovarian screening, or being 
referred for a suspected benign adnexal 
mass.59 Cohort entry was defined as the 
first occurrence of weight loss for the 
exposed group or, for the unexposed, study 
entry or 12 months after registering with 
the practice, if this was later
.22,23,38–42,45–49 One 
study, at high risk of ascertainment bias, 
used 5 years.58
Weight loss
There was marked heterogeneity in 
the definition of weight loss. One study 
used objective weight measurements, 
calculating the change between the 
weight measurement nearest to the date 
of diagnosis and the highest weight in 
the previous 2 years.8 All other database 
studies defined weight loss using a coded 
entry in the electronic GP record.22,23,38–53,59 
The code lists used to define weight loss 
were not published, and no study described 
the method used to discriminate weight 
loss from planned weight loss (for example, 
through dieting or exercise). In three studies 
‘any mention of weight loss’ was coded after 
review of the entire coded and non-coded GP 
record.54–56 Questionnaire studies defined 
weight loss as ‘subjective weight loss’,57 
‘weight loss (unplanned), or the appearance 
of weight loss’,59 and ‘unintended weight 
loss ≥6 weeks duration’.58

Risk of bias 
Figure 1 summarises the QUADAS-2 
assessment (further information is also 
available from the authors on request). In 
all, 15 studies were classified as high risk of 
bias in one domain.8,43–56 Three studies were 
classified as high risk of bias in more than 
one domain.57–59 The main potential sources 
of bias were: 
• applicability concerns when secondary 
care cases were matched either with 
primary care controls,57 using healthcare 
financing lists,58 or with outpatients or 
attendees at screening programmes;59 
• selection bias in studies using the 
case–control design, which exaggerates 
measures of test accuracy;8,18,43,44,50–59
• inclusion bias because eight studies did 
not describe why all participants were not 
included in the analysis; and
• recall bias in three studies using a 
retrospective questionnaire.57–59
Measures of diagnostic accuracy
Weight loss was a presenting feature of one 
in 14 cancers overall. This varied by cancer 
site: one in five prostate; one in 10 colorectal, 
gastro-oesophageal, and pancreatic; one in 
16 biliary tree; one in 25 myeloma, non-
Hodgkin’s lymphoma, and ovarian; and one 
in 33 lung and renal tract cancers. Further 
information on the diagnostic value of weight 
loss with other clinical and demographic 
features and forest plots is available from 
the authors on request. Figure 2 plots each 
study in ROC space using coloured symbols 
to denote subgroups of cancer site and 
sex. Demographic and diagnostic accuracy 
data for each study are available from the 
authors on request. 
Cancer type and stage
Sensitivity ranged from 2% to 47% across 
cancer types, and specificity from 92% to 
99% (further information available from the 
authors on request). Only colorectal and 
pancreatic cancer had sufficient studies 
for separate analyses (further information 
available from the authors on request). 
The pooled sensitivity for colorectal cancer 
was 14% (95% CI = 6 to 30%) and pooled 
specificity 97% (95% CI = 94 to 99%). The 
pooled sensitivity for pancreatic cancer 
was 13% (95% CI = 8 to 20%) and pooled 
specificity 99% (95% CI = 98 to 99%). 
Removing the studies at high risk of bias in 
more than one QUADAS-2 domain did not 
significantly alter the pooled results. 
In 
all, 
20 
studies 
adjusted 
for 
other 
covariates. 
These included potential confounders, such 
as age, but mainly symptoms known to 
be predictors of each cancer, for example, 
rectal bleeding in colorectal cancer (further 
information available from the authors on 
request). Adjustment left the diagnostic odds 
ratios (DORs) unchanged in all but three 
case–control studies, in which they were 
significantly reduced.8,43,55 Hazard ratios (HRs) 
ranged from 1.6 for ovarian cancer to 12.5 for 
pancreatic cancer across the cohort studies. 
In all cases, adjustment for other symptoms 
of cancer did not abolish the association 
between weight loss and a diagnosis of 
cancer
. No study reported the diagnostic 
value of weight loss according to the cancer 
stage.

 Sex and age
Five studies examined diagnostic accuracy 
by sex. In one study, the sensitivity and 
specificity for any cancer in males was 3% 
(95% CI = 3 to 4%) and 99% (95% CI = 99 
to 99%), respectively.22 In another, the 
sensitivity and specificity for any cancer in 
females was 5% (95% CI = 5 to 6%) and 
99% (95% CI = 99 to 99%), respectively.23 
However, there was no significant difference 
between HRs for males and females after 
adjustment for age, BMI, and other clinical 
features (further information available from 
the authors on request). The authors were 
not able to calculate summary estimates 
for age groups because studies reporting 
the same age range and cancer type were 
too few.
Positive predictive values 
PPVs for weight loss ranged from 0.0% 
for biliary tract cancer to 3.3% for prostate 
cancer (further information available from 
the authors on request). One study reported 
higher PPVs for colorectal cancer in people 
aged ≥70 years old (1.7%) compared with 
<70 years old (0.4%).57 Six studies reported 
the PPV for weight loss paired with another 
clinical feature ranging from 0.1% for chest 
pain for myeloma to 31.6% for jaundice 
in pancreatic cancer (further information 
available from the authors on request). 
Weight loss with another clinical feature 
yielded a PPV greater than weight loss 
alone, the paired clinical feature alone, or by 
adding together the individual PPVs.
The authors calculated cumulative 
PPVs by age group (Table 2). The more 
conservative estimates using the lowest 
LRs had a cumulative PPV of 3.0% in 
females ≥60 years, and 10.5% in males 
≥60 years, reaching the threshold for 
investigation (3%) used in the 2015 NICE 
guidelines.7 The more liberal estimate using 
the highest reported LRs for each cancer 
site resulted in females (6.7%) and males 
(14.2%) ≥60 years. The excess in males was 
largely the contribution of prostate cancer 
due to the relatively high LR and incidence. 
After removing prostate cancer from the 
analysis, the male PPV ≥60 years (7.8%) 
still reached the threshold for investigation 
(further information available from the 
authors on request).
DISCUSSION
Summary 
Patients presenting to primary care with 
weight loss are at higher risk of having 
cancer than patients without recorded 
weight loss. The 10 cancers were prostate, 
colorectal, 
lung, 
gastro-oesophageal, 
pancreatic, non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, 
ovarian, multiple myeloma, renal tract, 
and biliary tree. Across these cancer sites, 
sensitivity ranged from 2% to 47%, and 
specificity from 92% to 99%. The PPV of 
cancer in male and female patients with 
weight loss aged 60–79 years and ≥80 years 
exceeds the risk threshold for urgent 
investigation set out in NICE guidelines.7 
The risk with weight loss increases when it 
presents alongside another clinical feature 
suggesting an individual cancer site, and 
with increasing age.
Strengths and limitations
To the authors’ knowledge, this is the only 
review of weight loss as a feature of cancer 
in non-specialist settings. The authors used 
a broad search strategy to interrogate large 
electronic databases. They have calculated 
cumulative PPVs for the first time for weight 
loss across 10 cancer sites by using high-
quality national cancer incidence data. 
However, there are important limitations. 
Foremost, the authors can provide no 
clarification about how much weight loss

 is required to make cancer a possibility. 
Most studies defined weight loss using 
coding, but no studies reported the code 
lists used by the authors to define weight 
loss, so the authors are unable to report 
with confidence whether weight loss was 
unexpected or expected (following diet 
or exercise). It seems likely that a weight 
loss code represents unexpected weight 
loss, as a person who achieves weight loss 
intentionally is unlikely to report this to 
their GP. Similarly, a GP is unlikely to think 
that intentional weight loss is diagnostically 
relevant enough to code: GP coding has 
been shown to be prone to recording bias, 
which occurs when GPs preferentially 
code the ‘alarm’ features they consider 
to support their working diagnosis.60,61 For 
example, the inclusion of free-text data in 
one study reduced the PPV of jaundice for 
pancreatic cancer from 12.8% (95% CI = 7.3 
to 21.6) to 6.3% (95% CI = 4.5 to 8.7), and 
visible haematuria for bladder cancer from 
4.0% (95% CI = 3.5 to 4.6) to 2.9% (95% 
CI = 2.6 to 3.2).60 GPs commonly use free 
text to amplify the clinical narrative after 
coding ‘alarm’ symptoms, meaning that for 
some patients the entire details of a clinical 
feature remain hidden, invisible to analyses 
solely using symptom codes.60 Low-risk-
but-not-no-risk vague symptoms of cancer, 
such as abdominal pain or cough, have 
high prevalence in primary care, are coded 
less, and patients with them are less likely 
to prompt clinicians to refer patients with 
these symptoms for urgent investigation.60,62 
However, the authors have found no reports 
investigating the influence of recording bias 
on the prevalence of weight loss. From the 
colorectal cancer studies in this review, 
the prevalence of weight loss was highest 
when defined as ‘any mention of weight 
loss’ in the GP record (8.9%), intermediate 
when objective weight measurements were 
used (4.8%), and lowest when defined by 
Read coding alone (1.1%).8,48,55 Only one 
study used objective measurements to 
define weight loss, leaving studies at risk 
of misclassification due to missing data 
on weight.8,63 Furthermore, there were 
insufficient data to describe the grade 
or stage of cancer diagnosed in patients 
with weight loss and how this compares 
with cancer in patients presenting without 
weight loss. 
Finally, heterogeneity in diagnostic 
accuracy relates to heterogeneity in study 
quality: sensitivity was higher in studies 
at risk of recall bias; PPVs were higher in 
case–control studies compared with cohort 
studies reporting the same tumour site; and 
the calculation and interpretation of pooled 
estimates were limited by this heterogeneity. 
One study, for example, showed that weight 
loss was reported more frequently when 
data were collected by questionnaire or 
telephone interview compared with using 
only a coded entry in the electronic record.59 
Collecting data on unexpected weight loss 
by questionnaire increased the sensitivity 
and decreased the specificity compared with 
using only coded GP data. Ascertainment 
bias is also likely, despite most studies using 
an index test and reference standard within 
a 2-year period. Two studies have reported 
that within a 2-year window ‘serendipitous’ 
asymptomatic cancers are diagnosed 
when symptoms (not caused by cancer) are 
investigated.9,64
Comparison with existing literature
Others have reviewed the symptoms of 
single cancer sites.65–70 The authors have 
included all of their studies, except where 
concerns existed over study population65,66,69 
or inadequate reporting of 2 × 2 data,70 
and they included an additional study 
post-dating their searches.43 The authors 
identified no previous review of symptoms 
presenting to primary care in association 
with myeloma, non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, 
ovarian, or prostate cancer
. 
Implications for research and practice 
This review suggests that patients aged 
≥60 years presenting to primary care 
settings with weight loss that prompts 
a clinical record entry warrant rapid 
investigation for possible cancer, potentially 
across multiple possible sites. The findings 
will therefore be of interest to policymakers 
developing multidisciplinary symptom-
based referral pathways to complement 
existing site-specific routes.71,72 As a 
symptom of cancer, recorded weight loss is 
the second highest risk after rectal bleeding 
in colorectal cancer,65 haemoptysis in 
lung,54 rib pain in myeloma,50 jaundice 
in pancreatic,69 and haematuria in renal 
tract;39 and third highest in non-Hodgkin’s 
lymphoma,51 and gastro-oesophageal.41,45,53 
Additional symptoms in combination with 
weight loss strengthen these associations. 
The low sensitivity for weight loss reflects 
the clinical reality for patients that some 
cancers lead to weight loss while many more 
do not. Understanding the site distribution of 
cancer in these patients may inform the 
sequencing of investigation in this patient 
group. The low sensitivity also demonstrates 
that the absence of weight loss cannot be 
used to rule out cancer
. The extremely high 
specificity for weight loss has a number of 
potential and overlapping explanations: 
e319  British Journal of General Practice, May 2018
 • patients may only be attending primary 
care once weight loss is marked;
• clinicians may only code the symptom 
after conducting simple investigations to 
rule out other causes of weight loss; and
• the number of false positives is artificially 
low in comparison with the extremely 
high number of true negatives that 
represent the low prevalence of cancer in 
primary care populations. 
It is probable that when GPs choose 
to code weight loss this decision reflects 
that the clinician believes the symptom 
to be important. This belief may be based 
on additional symptoms or physical 
findings that may themselves represent an 
increased risk for cancer
. Thus, some of the 
risk of cancer associated with coded weight 
loss represents a broader assessment by 
the clinician. Arguably, this is helpful. These 
results clearly show that coded weight loss 
warrants investigative action. If clinical 
systems were designed to prompt the 
clinician to consider cancer whenever they 
enter a weight loss code, this prompting 
may lead to an expedited diagnosis.
To overcome the limitations outlined 
above, the ideal methodology to ascertain 
the diagnostic value of weight loss (or any 
other clinical feature relevant to multiple 
cancer types) in primary care would be a 
prospective cohort study. The prospective 
design overcomes biases in the studies in 
this review. As the prevalence of cancer 
(and weight loss) is low in primary care, a 
study powered to investigate all relevant 
symptoms to all cancers would have to be 
prohibitively large. The CANcer DIagnosis 
Decision Rules (CANDID) study is underway 
in UK primary care to investigate the clinical 
features of colorectal and lung cancer 
including weight loss, but the prevalence 
of weight loss in this cohort is still likely to 
be low.73 
There is more to be gained from historical 
cohort studies using routinely collected 
electronic record datasets22,23,74–76 that: 
• ascertain a prevalence for weight loss 
based on coded, non-coded, and numeric 
data;
• confirm cancer utilising the clinical record 
(coded and non-coded), and linkages to 
national cancer registries;
• report 2 × 2 data for weight loss in 
combination with other clinical features; 
and
• report diagnostic intervals and longer-
term outcomes. 
Research is required to understand the 
drivers of weight recording in primary care, 
and the extent of weight loss that prompts 
a GP to code it. Without these studies, we 
will remain unable to answer fundamental 
questions of ‘How much weight loss should 
I worry about?’
In the meantime, once a physician 
considers that weight loss in a patient 
≥60 years warrants a clinical entry, these 
data indicate that investigation to identify a 
cancer is then necessary.
