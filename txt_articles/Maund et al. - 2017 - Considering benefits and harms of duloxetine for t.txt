linical study reports are detailed reports of the design, 
conduct and results of clin 
ical trials. These reports form 
part of the applications that pharmaceutical companies 
submit to drug agencies for marketing authorization for new 
drugs.1 The European Medicines Agency (EMA) makes these 
reports publicly available upon request. Drug agencies in Canada 
and the United States, by contrast, keep this information confi-
dential.2 Clinical study reports contain considerably more data 
on harms than do journal articles and trial registry reports, and 
therefore should be used, when available, as a primary data 
source for systematic reviews.3 Various North American organiza-
tions, including the Can 
adian Medical Association and the Ameri-
can Medical Association, support the AllTrials initiative, which 
calls for clinical study reports, with individual patient data 
redacted, to be made publicly available.4 However, access to 
individual patient data in the reports would allow for more com-
plex analyses of harms, such as when a harm of interest com-
prises multiple symptoms.

ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND: The European Medicines 
Agency makes clinical study reports 
publicly available and publishes reasons 
for not approving applications for mar-
keting authorization. Duloxe 
tine has 
been approved in Europe for the treat-
ment of stress urinary incontinence in 
women. The reported adverse effects of 
duloxe 
tine include mental health prob-
lems and suicidality. We obtained clini-
cal study reports from the European 
Medicines Agency concerning use of this 
drug for stress urinary incontinence.
METHODS: We performed a meta-analysis 
of 4 randomized placebo-controlled tri-
als of duloxetine (involving a total of 
1913 patients) submitted to the Euro-
pean Medicines Agency for marketing 
approval for the indication of stress uri-
nary incontinence in women. We used 
data from the clinical study reports 
(totalling 6870 pages and including indi-
vidual patient data) to assess benefits 
(including frequency of incontinence 
and changes in quality-of-life scores, 
such as Patient Global Impression of 
Improvement rating) and harms (both 
general harms, including discontinua-
tion because of adverse events, and 
harms related to suicidality, violent 
behaviour and their potential precur-
sors, such as akathisia and activation 
[stimulating effects such as insomnia, 
anxiety and agitation]).
RESULTS: Duloxetine was significantly 
better than placebo in terms of percent-
age change in weekly incontinence epi-
sodes (mean difference –13.56%, 95% 
confidence interval [CI] –21.59% to 
–5.53%) and change in Incontinence 
Quality of Life total score (mean differ-
ence 3.24, 95% CI 2.00 to 4.48). How-
ever, the effect sizes were small, and a 
sensitivity analysis (with removal of one 
trial) showed that the number needed 
to treat for a Patient Global Impression 
of Improvement rating of “much better 
or very much better” was 8 (95% CI 6 to 
13). The numbers needed to harm were 
7 (95% CI 6 to 8) for discontinuing be-
cause of an adverse event and 7 (95% CI 
6 to 9) for experiencing an activation 
event. No suicidality, violence or akathi-
sia events were noted.
INTERPRETATION: Although duloxetine 
is effective for stress urinary inconti-
nence in women, the rates of associated 
harm were high when individual patient 
data were analyzed, and the harms out-
weighed the benefits.

10 adult women suffer from this condition,6 which causes substan-
tial impairment of quality of life and a considerable economic 
burden.7 Historically, treatment has consisted of conservative 
measures such as training of pelvic floor muscles or surgery. 
Duloxetine is a drug that has been approved in Canada, the US 
and Europe for the treatment of major depressive disorder. In 
2004, Eli Lilly submitted applications for duloxetine for the treat-
ment of stress urinary incontinence in women to the Canadian, 
US and European drug agencies,8,9 but this indication was 
approved only in Europe.9,10 Currently, unlike the situation for the 
EMA,11,12 reasons why marketing authorization applications are 
withdrawn or denied is not published by either the Canadian13 or 
the US drug agency (US Food and Drug Administration [FDA], 
Center for Drug Evaluation and Research: personal communica-
tion, Nov. 26, 2014). However, the FDA has said that a higher-
than-expected rate of suicide attempts was observed in the 
open-label extensions of controlled trials of duloxe 
tine for stress 
urinary incontinence.14
Given the FDA’s statement about the rate of suicide attempts,14 
we wanted to determine whether duloxetine increased the risk of 
suicidality, violence or their possible precursors (drug-induced 
akathisia, an extreme type of restlessness; activation, which con-
sists of stimulating effects such as insomnia, anxiety and agitation; 
emotional disturbance, such as depersonalization and derealiza-
tion; or psychotic events, such as delusions and hallucinations) in 
the randomized phases of the trials.15,16 We therefore assessed the 
benefits and harms of duloxetine in stress urinary incontinence 
using clinical study reports, including individual patient data, of 
the 4 main trials submitted to the EMA.17
Methods
Data sources
In 2011, in response to a wider request for access to clinical study 
reports of antidepressants, we obtained from the EMA reports 
concerning duloxetine for various indications. In our first research 
project, which was about depression, we found that the listings of 
adverse events for individual patients and the narratives of 
adverse events allowed a more accurate estimate of harms.3
The 4 reports that we received of placebo-controlled trials in 
stress urinary incontinence each had a unique identifier (SAAW, 
SBAT, SBAV, SBAX). The reports dated from 2001 and 2002 and 
totalled 6870 pages, including the protocols. The documents 
were provided as nonsearchable pdfs, but we made them search-
able using Adobe Acrobat Pro XI. 
Outcomes
The a priori benefits specified as outcomes in our protocol were 
the primary outcomes of each trial and the Patient Global 
Impression of Improvement.18
We divided the harms data (which were specified a priori) into 
general harms and harms related to suicidality and violence.
The general harms were deaths, nonfatal serious adverse 
events (any adverse event that was life-threatening, required ini-
tial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization, caused severe or per-
manent disability, caused congenital anomaly or was important 
for other reasons) and discontinuation because of adverse 
events. We also determined the number of patients experiencing 
at least one treatment-emergent adverse event. 
The harms related to suicidality and violence were suicidality 
(ideation, behaviour, suicide attempts, suicide), violent behav-
iour and their potential precursors (akathisia, emotional distur-
bance, psychotic events, activation), depression or worsening of 
depression. 
Search terms
Terms for suicidality were those that the FDA asked pharmaceutical 
companies to use when searching their own databases (Table 1).19 
For violence, the terms were those used in a study to determine the 
association of prescription drugs with violence using data from the 
FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (Table 1).20
We focused on akathisia, emotional disturbance and psy-
chotic events because these events, known as the “psychotropic 
suicidogenic triumvirate,” can predispose to suicidality and vio-
lence.15,16 We also recorded activation symptoms (including 
akathisia), which we obtained from the warnings in FDA product 
labelling for antidepressants.21 We obtained terms for other 
potential precursors to suicidality and violence from the litera-
ture.16,22,23 A systematic review has shown a lack of consensus 
about what the symptoms of activation are,22 and we were uncer-
tain about whether some events (e.g., nightmares, which can be 
a prelude to a psychotic event) should be treated as psychotic 
events.24 We therefore consulted a professor in psychiatry. Core 
activation events were those that the psych 
iatrist considered as 
activation, according to his knowledge and clinical experience. 
When we were uncertain, we preliminarily categorized the events 
as “potential.” Because of differences in symptoms, we kept psy-
chiatrist-defined activation as a category separate from FDA-
defined activation (Table 1).
Data extraction
Data on benefits were extracted from summary tables. For each 
study arm, one observer (L.S.G.) extracted the number of patients 
included in randomization and subsequent analy 
ses, the means 
and standard deviations for benefits and the number of patients in 
each category of the Patient Global Impression of Improvement. 
Extracted data were checked by a second observer (E.M.).
Two observers (E.M., L.S.G.) independently searched all data 
formats of harms manually, using the terms listed in Table 1. For 
one observer (L.S.G.), the study materials were blinded for data 
extraction, as follows. The other observer (E.M.) used the white 
redaction tool in Adobe Acrobat Pro XI to redact all drug names 
from all data formats of harms, including pre-existing conditions 
in individual patients. In addition, narrative texts were placed in 
Word documents, and all drug names (including dosages) and 
mentions of placebo were replaced by the generic term “drug X,” 
to avoid the possibility that the identity of the drug could be 
guessed from the number of missing characters.
For the manual search of harms data, each observer recorded 
the patient identification number, date of random assignment, 
adverse event term and data format (e.g., listing of all adverse 
events), onset and stop date of the event, severity, whether the 
 RESEARCH
E196 
CMAJ  |  FEBRUARY 6, 2017  |  VOLUME 189  |  ISSUE 5 
event was serious or led to discontinuation, and whether the 
term was the original investigator-reported term (“verbatim 
term”) or the preferred term from the Medical Dictionary for Reg-
ulatory Activ 
ities (MedDRA). The MedDRA is a hierarchic medical 
terminology system used to standardize entry, retrieval, analysis 
and display of adverse events data.25,26 Within MedDRA, verbatim 
terms are coded to the closest matching lowest-level terms. 
These lowest-level terms are aggregated at the next level into 
preferred terms, which are the favoured terms for use in submis-
sions to regulatory authorities.27
The two observers (E.M., L.S.G.) independently recoded pre-
ferred terms (and, if available, the verbatim terms as well) using 
the most recent version of MedDRA (version 17.0). Interobserver 
agreement was calculated, and discrepancies were resolved by 
consensus. To ensure that we had identified all of the relevant 
terms, we carried out electronic searches on all of the blinded 
documents using all of the terms identified. The data were then 
unblinded.
Overall, this process took an average of 3 months per observer. 
Post hoc decisions
We moved the activation event of tension from the potential sub-
category to the core subcategory of activation, because it belongs 
to the MedDRA high-level term of “anxiety symptoms,” and anxi-
ety was a core event of activation. We also added feeling abnor-
mal, which was not included in any of the original categories, to 
emotional disturbance, on the basis of the verbatim terms (e.g., 
fuzzy feeling). Finally, the events of dysthymic disorder and 
depressed mood were added as potential depression events. Sen-
sitivity analyses were performed to determine the effect of these 
decisions.
Statistical analysis
For each outcome, we combined the data in a meta-analysis. For 
binary outcomes, we calculated risk ratios (RRs) and risk differ-
ences, and for continuous outcomes we calculated mean differ-
ences with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using a fixed-effect 
model, because this approach gives more weight to large trials. If 
the hetero 
geneity was substantial (I2 > 50%), we explored the rea-
sons in sensitivity analyses. We performed the meta-analyses in 
RevMan, which adds 0.5 to cells with zero events.28 This adjustment 
does not cause bias if the study arms are of equal size.29
For harms, only treatment-emergent adverse events (i.e., those 
that began or worsened during the randomized phase) were of 
interest. Where categories of suicidality and violence-related harms 
consisted of both core and potential events, sensitivity analyses 
were performed using only the core events. For categories that 
included insomnia, sensitivity analyses were performed by exclud-
ing events that were not definitively insomnia (e.g., poor-quality 
sleep and sleep disorder).
For benefits, as specified a priori in the protocol, we deter-
mined whether the results were clinically relevant by comparing 
with the minimum clinically important difference for the primary 
outcome, as stated in the literature.
In post hoc analyses, we also calculated the number needed to 
treat and the number needed to harm for binary outcomes and

*Core adverse events were those that had been used as search terms in the published research or that were considered relevant by expert opinion.  
†Potential adverse events were events for which there was a lack of consistency in the literature or uncertainty over whether they were relevant. The effect of including potential 
events was explored in sensitivity analyses.  
‡Activation refers to stimulating effects, such as insomnia, anxiety and agitation.  
§Mania was reported as both an activation event and a psychotic event, because patients can report being “manic” when they are describing being more active than usual 
(i.e., experiencing activation).  
¶Tension was originally categorized as a potential activation event; however, tension codes to the higher-level term of “anxiety symptoms” in the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory 
Activities. Tension was therefore considered a core event in the main analyses. A sensitivity analysis was performed to evaluate the effect of this decision.

benefits. We considered a standardized mean difference of 0.2 a 
small effect, 0.5 a moderate effect and 0.8 a large effect.30
Results
Overall, 958 women with stress urinary incontin 
ence were ran-
domly assigned to receive duloxetine 80 mg, and 955 were 
assigned to receive placebo; in one trial, the starting dose of 
duloxetine was 40 mg and titrated upward. The weighted average 
age of women in the trials was 52 years. In all trials, use of anti-
depressants within 14 days before trial entry or during the trial 
was an exclusion criterion. Apart from substance abuse, there 
were no exclusion cri 
teria pertaining to psychiatric disorders. 
All arms in individual trials were compar 
able in terms of base-
line characteristics of pre-existing or historical diagnoses of psy-
chiatric symptoms and disorders, with the exception of one trial 
(SBAV), in which more women in the placebo arm had pre-
existing depression, relative to the duloxetine arm (18 v. 6, p = 
0.01). During 2 weeks without medication, the participants com-
pleted daily diaries about voluntary and involuntary urination. 
Patients who completed the diaries and met the inclusion cri-
teria entered a placebo lead-in period of 2 weeks, followed by 
randomization and 12 weeks of treatment with either duloxetine 
or placebo.
The clinical study reports contained trial protocols, summary 
tables of adverse events, listings and narratives of serious adverse 
events or discontinuations because of adverse events, and adverse 
event listings for individual patients as appendices. There were no 
examples of case report forms.
Both the protocols and the clinical study reports specified that 
adverse event data would be collected at the time of randomiza-
tion and at study visits every 4 weeks thereafter. However, none of 
the sources specified how these data would be ascertained. The 
published articles from these trials stated that adverse events 
were ascertained through nonprobing questions.31–34
All formats of harms data presented MedDRA preferred terms. 
Narratives were the only format to report verbatim terms.
Benefits
The protocol-specified primary outcomes were percentage 
change from baseline in frequency of incontinence episodes and 
mean change from baseline in Incontinence Quality of Life total 
score (range of scores 0 [worst] to 100 [best]).35 Data were shown 
only for patients with a baseline value and at least one post-
baseline value; the method used for missing values was last 
observation carried forward.
The weighted mean baseline value for weekly frequency of 
incontinence episodes was 16.8. Duloxetine was significantly bet-
ter than placebo in terms of percentage change from baseline in 
weekly incontinence episodes (n = 1738 patients, mean differ-
ence –13.56%, 95% CI –21.59% to –5.53%, I2 = 42%) and change 
in weekly number of incontinence episodes (mean difference 
–2.85, 95% CI –3.91 to –1.78, I2 = 27%) (Figure 1). We did not find 
any published minimum clinically important differences for this 
outcome. Effect sizes were small for both percentage change 
from baseline in weekly incontinence episodes (standardized 
mean difference –0.13, 95% CI –0.22 to –0.04, I2 = 64%; sensitivity 
analysis: standardized mean difference –0.05, 95% CI –0.16 to 
0.07, I2 = 19%) and change in the number of weekly incontinence 
episodes (standardized mean difference –0.26, 95% CI –0.35 to 
–0.16, I2 = 0%) (Appendix 1, available at www.cmaj.ca/lookup/
suppl/doi:10.1503/cmaj.151104/-/DC1). 
The weighted mean baseline value for Incontinence Quality of 
Life total score was 64.0. Duloxetine was better than placebo in 
terms of mean change in this score (mean difference 3.24, 95% CI 
2.00 to 4.48, I2 = 5%; Figure 2). However, given that the published 
minimum clinically important difference for the Incontin 
ence 
Quality of Life total score is 2.5,35 this difference may not be clini-
cally important. Furthermore, the effect size for this outcome 
was small (standardized mean difference 0.24, 95% CI 0.15 to 
0.33, I2 = 0%; Appendix 1).
The Patient Global Impression of Improvement rating is a 
globally validated measure of the improvement that a patient 
perceives since starting treatment. The trial protocols specified 
that responses would be grouped into 3 cat 
egories as a second-
ary analysis variable: “a little worse or very much worse,” “no 
change or a little better” and “much better or very much better”; 
we considered the last of these categories to represent a 
response to treatment. When all 4 trials were included in a meta-
analysis, there was considerable heterogeneity (I2 = 68%; Appen-
dix 1). Removal of 2 trials, one at a time, from the analysis 
reduced the heterogeneity to below 50% (Appendix 1). The great-
est reduction in heterogeneity was seen with removal of trial 
SBAX (RR 1.51, 95% CI 1.29 to 1.77, I2 = 36%; Appendix 1), with a 
number needed to treat of 8 (95% CI 6 to 13; Appendix 1). 
Harms
Summary tables and line listings provided only coded terms of 
adverse events. Narratives, which were only for patients who 
experienced a serious adverse event or discontinued participa-
tion because of an adverse event, contained the verbatim terms 
for the adverse events that the patients experienced and the cor-
responding coded terms. 
Adverse events in general
On cross-referencing the summary tables, line listings and narra-
tives, we found 1 serious adverse event in a patient receiving 
duloxetine and 2 in a patient receiving placebo, as well as 
adverse events that led to discontinuations in 6 patients receiv-
ing duloxetine and 4 receiving placebo, that began before ran-
domization and did not worsen in severity. These events did not 
meet the criteria for treatment-emergent adverse events and 
were excluded from our analyses. There was one death (in a 
patient receiving duloxetine, who died after a cerebrovascular 
accident), whereas 727 patients receiving duloxetine and 548 
receiving placebo had one or more adverse events (RR 1.32, 1.24 
to 1.41, I2 = 51% [Figure 3]; number needed to harm 6, 95% CI 5 to 
7 [Appendix 1]; sensitivity analysis RR 1.25, 95% CI 1.16 to 1.35, 
I2 = 0%; number needed to harm 7, 95% CI 5 to 10 [Appendix 1]). 
The risk of discontinuing because of an adverse event was more 
than 5 times higher among patients receiving duloxetine (RR

5.73, 4.00 to 8.20, I2 = 26% [Figure 3]; number needed to harm 7, 
95% CI 6 to 8 [Appendix 1]), and the risk of experiencing a nonfa-
tal serious adverse event was also higher (RR 1.77, 95% CI 0.79 to 
3.98, I2 = 0%; Appendix 1), although the difference was not statis-
tically significant.
Suicidality and violence
There were no events of violence that met our prespecified crite-
ria, but one patient receiving duloxetine experienced mild hostility 
that began 2 days after randomization. There were no reports of 
suicidality, but 8 patients (4 in the duloxetine group and 4 in the 
placebo group) experienced injuries or burns. There were no nar-
ratives for these patients, and therefore no information about the 
context or nature of these events.
Harms predisposing to suicidality or violence
According to our criteria, 2 patients receiving duloxetine experi-
enced a total of 5 serious adverse events potentially predispos-
ing to suicidality or violence; these were severe depression, panic 
attacks and severe anxiety. The many events that were not con-
sidered serious are described in the following section.
Activation events
Core or potential activation events were experienced by 187 
patients in the duloxetine group and 42 patients in the placebo 
group. Among these patients, 46 (41 in the duloxetine group and 
5 in the placebo group) experienced more than one event of 
interest (range 2 to 6 events). The risk of experiencing a core or 
potential activation event was more than 4 times higher in the

number needed to harm 25, 95% CI 18 to 42; Appendix 1). 
Twenty-eight patients (27 in the duloxetine group and 1 in the 
placebo group) discontinued participation because of activation 
events. The most frequently reported core event was anxiety 
(18 patients in the duloxetine group and 6 in the placebo group).
The results were similar for FDA-defined activation events 
(Table 2 and Appendix 1).
Akathisia, emotional disturbance, psychosis and depression
No akathisia events were reported, whereas 18 patients in the 
duloxetine group and 3 in the placebo group experienced emo-
tional disturbance (Table 2) (RR 4.73, 1.62 to 13.85, I2 = 0% [Figure 
3]; number needed to harm 65, 95% CI 40 to 170 [Appendix 1]). In 
addition, 3 patients in the duloxetine group and 1 in the placebo 
group discontinued participation because of emotional distur-
bance. The most frequently reported event was feeling abnormal 
(8 patients in the duloxetine group and 1 in the placebo group).
Thirty patients (21 in the duloxetine group and 9 in the pla-
cebo group) experienced a core or potential psychotic event (as 
defined in Table 2) (RR 2.25, 1.06 to 4.81, I2 = 0% [Figure 3]; num-
ber needed to harm 80, 95% CI 40 to 834 [Appendix 1]). The risk 
of experiencing a core event was similar (RR 2.49, 0.78 to 7.89, I2 = 
0%; Appendix 1), but not statistically significant. The most fre-
quently reported core event was disorientation (4 patients in the 
duloxetine group and 1 in the placebo group). One patient 
receiving duloxetine discontinued participation because of a 
confusional state.
Depression-related events were similar for patients receiving 
duloxetine and placebo (RR 1.26, 0.58 to 2.71, I2 = 26%; Appendix 1).
Interobserver agreement
In the 4 trials, an average of 22% of patients receiving duloxetine 
and 5% of those receiving placebo experienced serious adverse 
events or discontinued participation because of adverse events 
(and therefore had narratives). A total of 96 patients with 139 
adverse events of interest to the current analysis had a narrative. 
When 2 of us (E.M., L.S.G.) independently recoded the verbatim 
terms using MedDRA, there was excellent interobserver agreement 
(for lower-level terms, κ = 0.92; for preferred terms, κ = 0.99).
Events identifiable only from narratives
There were 4 events of interest, involving 4 patients (all receiving 
duloxetine), that were obscured by the coded term used but of 
which we became aware through the verbatim terms provided in 
the narratives. For example, one patient had a “nervous break-
down,” which was coded as mental disorder, and another 
patient reported “feeling drugged,” which was coded as somno-
lence. In addition, 5 patients, all receiving duloxetine, experi-
enced a total of 8 events that were mentioned only in the narra-
tive text.
Interpretation
We found a statistically significant difference between duloxetine 
and placebo in terms of percentage change in frequency of incon-
tinence episodes and change in the Incontinence Quality of Life 
total score. However, the effect sizes for both of these benefits 
were small. Furthermore, given that the confidence interval for the 
effect size for Incontinence Quality of Life total score crossed the

*These adverse events occurred in either the duloxetine arm or the placebo arm, or in both arms. 
†The data presented in this table are the preferred terms from the MedDRA (version 17.0) that were used for recoding of the original preferred terms (and also the verbatim terms, if 
available) of adverse events provided in the clinical study reports of the 4 trials of duloxetine for stress urinary incontinence.
‡Core adverse events were those that had been used as search terms in the published research or that were considered relevant by expert opinion.  
§Potential adverse events were events for which there was a lack of consistency in the literature or uncertainty over whether they were relevant. The effect of including potential 
events was explored in sensitivity analyses.  
¶Nervousness, stress and tension are not explicitly mentioned in FDA-defined activation. Anxiety is categorized as an FDA-defined activation event, and nervousness, stress and 
tension all code to the higher-level term of “anxiety symptoms” in the MedDRA. These 3 types of events were therefore included in the analyses of FDA-defined activation.

published value for the minimum clinically important difference, 
the difference for this outcome may not be of clinical significance. 
We also found a statistically significant difference for Patient 
Global Impression of Improvement, but the number needed to 
treat for this outcome was not less than the number needed to 
harm in terms of discontinuations due to adverse events or in terms 
of core or potential activation events. This finding suggests that the 
benefits of duloxetine for stress urinary incontinence do not out-
weigh its harms. We did not find any adverse events of suicidality or 
violence, but many of the patients experienced unpleasant events 
that might have predisposed them to suicidality and violence (e.g., 
the number needed to harm was 7 for a core or potential activation 
event). It was possible for us to analyze harms consisting of multi-
ple symptoms, such as activation, only because we had access to 
individual patient data contained in the clinical study reports.
Systematic reviews assessing the benefits and harms of dulox-
etine for stress urinary incontinence have been performed by the 
Cochrane Collaboration36 and by the US Agency for Healthcare 
Research and Quality (AHRQ).37 Neither of these reviews included 
meta-analyses of percentage or numeric change in weekly fre-
quency of incontinence episodes, and neither reported on suicid-
ality. Furthermore, for the outcomes below, none of the analy 
ses 
in either review included data from all 4 trials that were included 
in our review.
The Cochrane review36 found a slightly larger change in Incon-
tinence Quality of Life total score (RR 4.50, 95% CI 2.83 to 6.18). 
However, its analysis included data from 3 trials, only 2 of which 
were among our 4 trials. Furthermore, the dose of duloxetine 
used in the third trial was higher (120 mg daily) than that used in 
our trials. The AHRQ review37 noted only that Incontinence Qual-
ity of Life total score was inconsistent among trials.
Both of the reviews assessed the Patient Global Impression of 
Improvement. The Cochrane review36 included patients who felt 
“very much better, much better, or a little better,” and found a rel-
ative treatment effect slightly lower than ours (RR 1.25, 95% CI 
1.14 to 1.36). The AHRQ review37 used the same Patient Global 
Impression of Improvement variable as we did, but its analysis 
consisted of 4 trials, only one of which was included in our analy-
sis. It found a larger number needed to treat (13, 95% CI 7 to 143) 
than we did.
Our results for any treatment-emergent adverse events were 
similar to those of both the Cochrane review36 (RR 1.31, 95% CI 
1.24 to 1.39) and the AHRQ review37 (RR 1.36, 95% CI 1.28 to 1.44). 
Both the AHRQ review37 and our own review found that the rela-
tive risk of individual harms was much larger than the relative 
risk of the outcome of any treatment-emergent adverse event. 
Our results for discontinuation due to adverse events were 
slightly higher than those reported in both the Cochrane review36 
(RR 4.50, 95% CI 3.44 to 5.89) and the AHRQ review37 (RR 4.4, 95% 
CI 3.24 to 5.86). Our results for discontinuation due to adverse 
events were similar to those of a published pooled analysis (i.e., 
not a meta-analysis) performed by Eli Lilly using data from the 
4 trials that we included.38 That analysis found adverse event dis-
continuation rates of 20.5% for duloxetine and 3.9% for placebo 
(p < 0.001). That study also found no reported cases of suicide or 
attempted suicide among patients taking duloxetine.38
Our findings are also in line with evidence from a cohort study, 
in which 228 women with stress urinary incontinence were given 
duloxe 
tine as an alternative to surgery.39 Two-thirds of the patients 
(68%) discontinued the drug within the first 4 weeks of treatment, 
mainly because of adverse events. By the end of 1 year, only 9% of 
the cohort were still taking duloxetine, with 82% having decided to 
undergo surgery.
Notably, the UK National Institute for Health and Care Excel-
lence guideline states that duloxetine should not be used as a 
first-line treatment or routinely offered as a second-line treat-
ment for stress urinary incontinence, given that pelvic floor mus-
cle training is more effective and less costly than duloxetine and 
that surgery is more cost-effective than duloxetine.40
Some of our harms of interest (e.g., activation) consisted of mul-
tiple possible symptoms. It would have been impossible to perform 
meta-analyses of these harms if we had had access only to journal 
articles or to the summary data provided in clinical study reports, 
and not to individual patient data. According to a blog post, the 
authors of the Cochrane review of oseltamivir for influenza also 
found that narratives and line listings contained in clinical study 
reports were essential for their review.41 Despite earlier promises, 
the EMA recently announced that it will not publish individual ano-
nymized patient data contained in the appendices of clinical study 
reports in the first round of implementation of its new policy,42 
which came into effect on Jan. 1, 2015. The EMA’s reason is that it 
needs to find a reliable way to anonymize the data. However, in 
accordance with current legislation,43 the data are already anony-
mized, and the EMA’s approach is inconsistent, given that research-
ers can get access to the harms in the old trials that are in the EMA’s 
possession. As we have shown here and previously,3 individual 
patient data contained in appendices of clinical study reports are 
essential for reliable assessment of drug harms. Furthermore, we 
did not find any deficiencies in the anonymization of the individual 
patient data that we received from the EMA for the current study.
Limitations
One limitation of this study was that the data for the beneficial 
effects of duloxetine, especially for frequency of incontinence 
episodes, were considerably skewed.44 Another reason why these 
results should be interpreted with caution is the unblinding due 
to adverse effects.45,46 The effects on incontinence that we found, 
in terms of changes in frequency of incontinence episodes and 
the Incontinence Quality of Life total score, were small. Anti-
depressant trials have been shown to be inadequately blinded 
because of the adverse effects that these drugs have.45,46 There-
fore, the small effects we found could be fully explained by 
unblinding bias.
Only 958 patients were receiving duloxetine, which means 
that the sample was too small to detect rare events of suicidality 
and violence. Furthermore, the data on adverse events were 
obtained through nonprobing questions, an approach that leads 
to underreporting of adverse events,47 especially for events of a 
sensi 
tive nature48 (such as suicidal ideation, suicidal behaviour 
and violence). Suicidality events have been much underreported 
in clin 
ical trials and observational studies, including those con-
ducted by Eli Lilly.49

We may also have underestimated harms because we did not 
have access to the completed case report forms (data collection 
forms) of the trials. Le Noury and associates50 recently reanalyzed 
a trial of the antidepressants paroxe 
tine and imipramine versus 
placebo, using data from the clinical study report (including indi-
vidual patient data) and a sample of the trial’s case report forms. 
They found adverse events recorded on case report forms that 
were not transcribed into patient-level listings of adverse events. 
The most common adverse events not transcribed were psychiat-
ric in nature, occurring among patients who received paroxetine. 
Furthermore, relying on adverse event listings in individual patient 
data, instead of case report forms, caused underestimation of 
adverse events by between 7% and 14%.
A further limitation of our study was that data extraction of 
benefits was performed by one person and checked by a second, 
rather than being performed in duplicate.
Conclusion
Given the uncertainty as to whether duloxetine leads to clinically 
significant improvement in quality of life, and given that improve-
ments measured as Patient Global Impression of Improvement 
did not outweigh discontinuations due to adverse effects, or core 
or potential activation events, we question the rationale for using 
duloxetine for stress urinary incontin 
ence. Evaluation of harms 
that were possible precursors to suicidality would have been 
impossible using only summary data in the clinical study reports. 
Individual patient data of adverse events contained in clinical 
study reports are therefore essential for a reliable assessment of 
drug harms.
