Abstract
Background Operative correction of anorectal malformations (ARMs) remains a challenge in pediatric surgery. The
study aimed to evaluate the outcomes of laparoscopic treatment of ARM in children.
Methods From 2007 to 2014, we performed 104 laparoscopic-assisted anorectal pull-through procedures in children
with a mean age of 11.3 ± 0.4 months and ARMs. Clinical assessment, surgical durations, complications, and
postoperative outcome were investigated.
Results The mean duration of the operation was 126.5 ± 17.2 min. Mean intraoperative bleeding was 20 ± 5.7 g.
Three (2.9 %) children required conversion to laparotomy. One (0.9 %) child developed a pelvic abscess, requiring
an additional intervention. Three to six months after laparoscopic-assisted anorectal pull-through, 72 patients were
hospitalized for stoma closure. Good functional results were achieved in 39 (54.2 %) patients. On examination of the
perineum, 11 (15.3 %) patients were found to have mucosal prolapse. The circular symmetric anal reflex to tactile
stimulation was confirmed in 53 (73.6 %) patients and a tactile weakened anal reflex in 5 (6.9 %) children. At the
1-year follow-up, constipation was present in nine (12.5 %) patients and soling in two (2.8 %) patients. A barium
enema study performed after the operation showed good outcomes in 67 (93.1 %) patients and fair outcomes in 5
(6.9 %) patients. None had a poor outcome.
Conclusions Our experience confirms that laparoscopic-assisted anorectal pull-through enabled complete correction
of ARM in the meanwhile avoiding damage to the rectum and anus. Also, the technique of double bipolar myos-
timulation of muscle complex in laparoscopic ARM might lead to these better results.
Introduction
Anorectal malformations (ARMs) occur at an approxi-
mate frequency of one in 4000 live births, a rate that has
changed little over time [1, 2]. Operative correction of
this pathology remains a challenge in pediatric surgery
[3–6]. Despite the development of innovative approaches,
the rates of poor results and complications after radical
intervention for these anomalies are high, ranging from 45
to 75 % [7, 8].

 Several different strategies are used for the operative
correction of ARMs. One of the first operations performed
by pediatric surgeons was abdominoperineal proctoplasty.
The aim of the procedure was to mobilize the left and
rectosigmoid segments of the colon through an abdominal
access; in the following sacroperineal stage, the mobilized
bowel was pulled as close as possible to the sacrum, thus
preserving the puborectalis sling [9, 10]. In 1980, posterior
sagittal anorectoplasty, developed by Pena et al. [11], was
introduced; it has since become the gold standard and
therefore one of the most frequently performed surgeries in
children with ARMs. This approach correlates positively
with the external appearance of the perineum and operative
findings. Nonetheless, both abdominoperineal proctoplasty
and posterior sagittal anorectoplasty have their advantages
and disadvantages [12–14].
A new development in the treatment of high ARMs was
introduced in 1990, when Georgeson et al. [15] developed
and implemented laparoscopic-assisted pull-through. This
method, which has been adopted worldwide [16–18],
avoids the division and weakening of the external sphinc-
ters. However, improved methods for the operative treat-
ment of children with ARMs are still needed and the
immediate and long-term results must be critically assessed
[19–21]. In this study, we evaluated the outcomes of
laparoscopic treatment of pediatric ARM.
Materials and methods
From 2007 to 2014, we performed 104 laparoscopic-as-
sisted anorectal pull-through procedures in children with
ARMs. The patients had a mean age of 11.3 ± 0.4 months,
and all procedures were done at the Departments of Pedi-
atric Surgery [Central Clinical Hospital of the Presidential
Administration of the Russian Federation, Moscow; Stav-
ropol State Medical University, Stavropol (Russia) and
Dnepropetrovsk
Regional
Children’s
Hospital,
Dne-
propetrovsk (Ukraine)]. The studies were approved by the
ethics committees of the participating institutions, and
informed consent was obtained from the parents of the
patients, as their legal representatives. There were 86
(82.7 %) boys and 18 (17.3 %) girls. ARMs in the boys
included rectourethral fistula (prostatic and bulbar; n = 72,
69.2 %), rectovesical fistula (n = 8, 7.7 %), and ARM
without fistula (n = 6, 5.8 %, Table 1). ARMs in the girls
included persistent cloaca (n = 13, 12.5 %) and recto-
vaginal fistula (5, 4.8 %). Girls with persistent cloaca had a
short cloacal channel of\
3 cm. Two of these patients had
a genitourinary sinus\
3 cm and high inflow at the rectum
into the vagina. All of the patients had different types of
stomas: a double-barrel colostomy in 88 (84.6 %), an end
colostomy in 3 (2.9 %), a double-barrel ileostomy in 4
(3.9 %), and an end ileostomy in 9 (8.6 %).
The following measures were implemented to prevent
complications. First, both a distal loopogram and an
urethrogram were performed. Second, colonoscopy was
performed through the stoma. Third, five girls with per-
sistent cloaca underwent intravenous contrast-enhanced
computed tomography, performed with additional contrast
enhancement of the distal colon. Finally, colonoscopy was
performed in five children and urethroscopy in seven
children. A comprehensive survey helped in planning the
operations.
Before starting the operation, the peridural space was
catheterized for ropivacaine anesthesia, administered peri-
operatively and postoperatively to children without sacral
anomalies. A sterile 6- to 10-Ch Foley catheter was posi-
tioned, depending on the size of the meatus and the age of
the child. A 5-mm port was then fitted through a puncture
at the top of the navel, after which two 5-mm ports were
introduced in the right half of the abdomen. For improved
visualization in the deep pelvis, we used a U-stitch on the
bladder wall, placed through the abdominal wall. Mobi-
lization was performed only at the distal rectum, avoiding
the fistulous opening into the bladder, or into the urethra in
boys or the vagina in girls, taking care to prevent future
prolapse. The distal part of the colon was transfixed using
an extracorporeal or intracorporeal suture, thus cutting off
the fistula (Fig. 1). The fistula at the confluence of the
pelvic organs (urethra, bladder, and vagina) was ligated
with a transfixing suture. Double bipolar myostimulation
was then applied using a modified Pen
˜a electrostimulator,
first in the abdomen and then at the perineum. Laparoscopy
included bipolar stimulation of the puborectal muscle via a
trocar, followed by bipolar perineal electrostimulation to
determine the topographic projection of the anus. The
levator ani muscles and the pull-through site were clearly
visualized from both the abdomen and the perineum. At the
site of the projected perineal anus, the skin was dissected to
1 cm to create a tunnel, which was then progressively
dilated using increasingly larger Hegar’s dilators. The

 distal end of the dissected rectum was brought through the
tunnel in the perineum under direct laparoscopic vision.
The bowel was fixed to the skin with absorbable sutures
(Fig. 2). A partial genitourological mobilization was con-
ducted in five girls with persistent cloaca, using a perineal
approach. The abdominal intestine was fixed to the parietal
peritoneum of the seromuscular coat. Particular attention
was paid to the correct formation of the anal canal in the
musculofascial complex of the pelvic diaphragm and an
adequate bowel through the anal sphincter.
Postoperatively, all patients were administered antibacte-
rial therapy for 7 days. Feeding began 1–2 days after the
operation, when peristaltic sounds were heard. Epidural
spinal anesthesia was continued for 2–3 days. The urethral
catheter was removed on postoperative day 8. The first anal
dilation
was
started
2 weeks
after
the
operation.
Laparoscopic-assisted anorectal pull-through by ileostomy or
closure
by
colostomy
was
conducted
3–6 months
postoperatively.
The operative techniques and follow-up were similar in
all hospitals participating in the study. Two pediatric sur-
geons from each hospital took part in the surgical and
clinical assessments. Follow-up of the patients was con-
ducted within 3–6 months and after more than 1 year after
the laparoscopic-assisted anorectal pull-through. The data
were recorded in the medical charts. The Krickenbeck
diagnostic criteria were used in the diagnosis of ARMs and
in the postoperative evaluation [22]. Clinical assessment of
the circular symmetry of the anal reflex was estimated in
all of the patients. Voluntary bowel movements were
evaluated in patients older than 5 years of age. All of the
patients underwent a barium enema study. The findings
were classified according to the three categories defined by
Kimura et al. [17]. Good: The anorectal angulation was
acute, and an empty segment corresponding to the anal
canal was recognized. Fair: The anorectal angulation was
less prominent, and the mucosa of the anal canal was
slightly outlined by its barium coating. Poor: The anorectal
angulation could not be identified. The mucosa of the anal
canal was well outlined by its barium coating, and there
was no identifiable empty segment. Numerical data are
expressed as the mean ± standard deviation. Student’s
t test was used in the statistical analysis. A p value \
0.05
was considered to indicate statistical significance. This
study was conducted with the approval of the respective
institutional review boards.
Results
The mean duration of the operation was 126.5 ± 17.2 min.
The amount of intraoperative bleeding was 20 ± 5.7 g.
Three (2.9 %) children had technical complications during
the early development of this technique and required con-
version
to
laparotomy.
Despite
careful
preoperative
preparation, fecal contamination involving the distal colon
and the fistula occurred in patients with double-barrel
colostomies. One (0.9 %) child developed a pelvic abscess,
and thus required an additional intervention. All subse-
quent patients underwent preoperative colonoscopy with
visual assessment of the distal colon. Fecal masses iden-
tified on endoscopy were removed.
Three to 6 months after laparoscopic-assisted anorectal
pull-through, 72 patients were hospitalized for closure of
the stoma. In 16 children, the colostomy was closed at
other hospitals (they excluded from our investigation).
Good functional results were achieved in 39 (54.2 %)
children (Fig. 3). Examination of the perineum revealed
mucosal prolapse in 11 (15.3 %) patients and was corrected

 with closure of the stoma. Circular symmetry of the anal
reflex in response to tactile stimulation was confirmed in 53
(73.6 %) patients, circular asymmetry in 14 (19.5 %)
patients, and a weakened anal reflex in 5 (6.9 %) patients.
These five patients showed signs of an underdeveloped
perineum (absence of the coccyx, sacral hypoplasia, and
sagging crotch).
One year after the operation, an evaluation of 72 patients
revealed constipation in nine (12.5 %): five (6.9 %) of these
patients required laxatives and dietary modifications (grade 2
in the Krickenbeck classification), while the remaining four
(5.6 %) required the use of regular cleansing enemas (grade
3 in the Krickenbeck classification). Continence was present
in two (2.8 %) children: one (1.4 %) with grade 1 and one
(1.4 %) with grade 2, according to the Krickenbeck classi-
fication. Barium enema studies performed[
1 year after the
operation showed that the outcome was good in 67 (93.1 %)
patients and fair in 5 (6.9 %) patients; there were no patients
with a poor outcome.
Discussion
A laparoscopic procedure is an excellent alternative to
laparotomy in children with ARMs, as it significantly
reduces the rate of complications such as prolapse, poste-
rior urethral diverticulum, and urethral injuries [16]. Pre-
vious publications have confirmed that the outcomes
achieved with laparoscopic anorectoplasty are comparable
to those of open surgery, based on short- and medium-term
follow-up [23–25].
In a study that compared laparoscopic abdominoperineal
rectoplasty (ARP) with open ARP [17], the authors
investigated the benefits of the laparoscopic approach in
infants with high ARMs. The main advantage of laparo-
scopic versus open ARP was a significant reduction in
intraoperative
bleeding
(12 ± 11
and
65 ± 44 g,
respectively). The anorectal reflex was positive in three
(23.1 %) children after laparoscopic ARP and in one
(6.7 %) after open ARP. Mucosal prolapse occurred in
none of the patients after laparoscopic ARP and in 10
(66.7 %) after open ARP.
A previous study of 15 pediatric patients described an
alternative method using the posterior sagittal approach
combined with laparoscopy for the repair of recto-bladder-
neck fistula or high rectoprostatic fistula [2]. Laparoscopic
fistula ligation was performed in all 15 patients. A
laparotomy was needed in two (13.3 %) boys to mobilize a
very high rectum with selective vessel ligation. Follow-up
of the patients 3 months to 10 years after surgery showed
that five (33.3 %) boys were fecally incontinent and one
(6.7 %) boy was fecally continent. Four (26.7 %) boys
underwent surgical repair of a rectal mucosal prolapse.
In our study, data on 104 patients with ARM treated at
three pediatric surgical centers during eight consecutive
years (2007–2014) were evaluated. Only 84.6 % patients
had a standard double-barrel sigmoid colostomy. The other
children had atypical stomas (double-barrel ileostomy, end
colostomy, and end ileostomy in 3.9, 2.9, and 8.6 %,
respectively). Two-thirds of the patients came to us from
other hospitals, after stoma creation. One-third of the
children had been operated on during the neonatal period,
after being diagnosed with a congenital disease (ileal
atresia) or necrotizing enterocolitis.
Laparoscopic-assisted anorectal pull-through in children
allows direct visualization of the pelvic structures and thus
minimizes accidental injury. In addition, it enables identi-
fication of the muscular layer, complete fistula excision,
and exact distal rectum placement within the muscle
complex. Double bipolar myostimulation combines the
advantages of laparoscopic and open techniques. The
bipolar laparoscopic dissector provided a clear visualiza-
tion of the levator ani muscles and the pull-through site,
with bipolar myostimulation performed through a trocar, as
described by Lima et al. [26]. But while those authors only
used
laparoscopic
electrostimulation,
we
additionally
applied a modified Pen
˜a bipolar myostimulator to the
perineum.
In conclusion, our experience has shown that laparo-
scopic-assisted anorectal pull-through enables the correc-
tion of ARMs and avoids damage to the rectum and anus.
The intraoperative technique of double bipolar myostimu-
lation of the muscle complex in laparoscopic ARM prob-
ably accounts for the better outcomes. However, our results
remain to be confirmed in integrated studies of the long-
term results in children with ARMs.
