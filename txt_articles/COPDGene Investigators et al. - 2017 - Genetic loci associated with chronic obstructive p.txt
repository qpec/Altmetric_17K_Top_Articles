 Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a leading cause of mortality worldwide1. 
We performed a genetic association in 15,256 cases and 47,936 controls, with replication of 
select top results (P < 5×10−6) in 9,498 cases and 9,748 controls. In the combined meta-
analysis, we identified 22 loci at genome-wide significance, including 13 new associations 
with COPD. Nine of these 13 loci have been associated with lung function in general 
population samples2–7; however, 4 (EEFSEC, DSP, MTCL1, and SFTPD) are novel. We 
noted 2 loci shared with pulmonary fibrosis8,9 (FAM13A and DSP) but with opposite risk 
alleles for COPD. None of our loci overlapped with genome-wide associations for asthma; 
however, one locus has been implicated in the joint susceptibility to asthma and obesity10. 
We also identified genetic correlation between COPD and asthma. Our findings highlight 
novel loci, demonstrate the importance of specific lung function loci to COPD, and identify 
potential regions of genetic overlap between COPD and other respiratory diseases.
COPD is characterized by persistent and progressive airflow limitation diagnosed by lung 
function testing1. While cigarette smoking is the major risk factor, susceptibility is also 
influenced by genetics11–13. We established the International COPD Genetics Consortium 
(ICGC) to coordinate efforts to find susceptibility loci14. We defined cases based on pre-
bronchodilator evidence of moderate-to-severe airflow limitation by modified GOLD 
criteria15; controls had normal spirometry, and all analyses were adjusted for age, sex, and 
cigarette smoking (pack-years and smoking status). We performed a two-stage genome-wide 
association study (Figure 1). In Stage 1, we combined 26 cohorts (Supplementary Table 1 
and 2) containing 63,192 individuals (15,256 COPD cases and 47,936 controls). We selected 
79 loci with P < 5×10−6 and in analysis Stage 2, we tested them in the UK BiLEVE dataset 
(9,498 COPD cases and 9,748 controls) from the UK Biobank and performed an overall 
meta-analysis (Supplementary Table 3).
We identified 13 genome-wide significant (P < 5×10−8) associations in Stage 1. Following 
the Stage 2 analysis, an additional 9 loci achieved genome-wide significance in the overall 
meta-analysis (Table 1, Figure 2, Supplementary Figures 1 and 2). Analysis of only 
European ancestry (Supplementary Table 4) and only African ancestry (Supplementary 
Table 5 and Supplementary Figure 3) Stage 1 cohorts showed no unique association signals. 
Of the 22 genome-wide significant loci described in our study, 9 have been previously 
described as genome- (or exome-) wide significant in studies of COPD13,16–19: HHIP, 
CHRNA5, HTR4, FAM13A, RIN3, TGFB2, GSTCD-NPNT, CYP2A6, and IL27-
CCDC101. The remaining 13 loci have not been previously associated with COPD at 
genome- (or exome-) wide significance. Eight of these 13 loci: ADGRG6/GPR126, THSD4, 
ADAM19, TET2, CFDP1, AGER, ARMC2, and RARB have been previously described and 
replicated (Supplementary Table 6) in general population GWASs of two measures of lung 
function (FEV1 and FEV1/FVC) that are used in conjunction to diagnose COPD2,4–7,20,21. 
One locus near PID1 was previously associated with FEV1/FVC, but had not replicated in 
those studies4,6. Four loci are newly being described as genome-wide significant in 
association with either COPD or lung function: EEFSEC, DSP, MTCL1, and SFTPD (Figure 
3).
To explore the potential function and causal genes for our novel loci, in addition to using 
publicly available datasets and prioritization tools (Supplementary Table 7), we also

 examined a larger set of lung expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) in 1038 subjects, 
including subjects with COPD22 (Supplementary Table 8). As eQTL are pervasive, we also 
attempted to determine whether our association signal co-localized23 with an eQTL signal in 
lung tissue (Supplementary Table 9). We found strong evidence of co-localization (posterior 
probability > 0.8) for DSP, a major protein of desmosomes required for epidermal 
integrity24, and MTCL1, important in epithelial-cell-specific microtubule stabilization25,26, 
and expressed in respiratory epithelial cells27. Variants in strong LD with our top MTCL1 
variant rs647097 (NC_000018.9:g.8808464T>C) appear to have enhancer histone marks in 
fetal lung fibroblasts28,29. In contrast, we found no evidence of a strong eQTL signal or co-
localization at our other two novel loci. At 3q21, EEFSEC is a potential candidate, as it is a 
paralog of TUFM, a top blood and lung eQTL gene for the 16p11.2/IL27 COPD 
susceptibility locus19, recently part of a novel COPD-related pathway involving 
NLRX130–32. At 10q22, pulmonary surfactant-associated protein D (SFTPD) is the most 
likely candidate, as it is highly expressed in pneumocytes27, and sftpd (−/−) mice develop 
pulmonary emphysema33. SFTPD has been explored as a COPD biomarker34, and while 
rs721917 (NC_000010.10:g.81706324A>G) is not an eQTL, polymorphisms in SFTPD, 
including rs721917, may lead to decreased surfactant protein D levels35; though the 
association of SFTPD polymorphisms with COPD susceptibility have been inconsistent. Our 
analysis also led to some additional insights into other previously described loci. We found 
evidence of COPD association and eQTL statistical co-localization in lung tissue (posterior 
probability > 0.8) for THSD4, HHIP, AGER, CHRNA3, and RARB (Supplementary Table 
9). Additional data on eQTLs (Supplementary Table 8), cohort-specific associations at each 
locus (Supplementary Figures 1a–v), fine mapping (Supplementary Note and Supplementary 
Table 10), causal gene (Supplementary Table 11 and 12), and other supportive analysis for 
previously described and novel loci can be found in the Supplementary Note.
We note that our top variant at DSP (rs2076295, NC_000006.11:g.7563232T>G) is also 
associated (P = 1.1×10−19) with pulmonary fibrosis8. Recently, a re-sequencing study36 at 
the DSP locus identified a second fibrosis-associated variant, rs2744371 (NC_000006.11:g.
7554174A>C) with Pfibrosis = 0.002 and PCOPD = 0.04. We also note overlap at the FAM13A 
locus (top fibrosis SNP8, rs2609255 [NC_000004.11:g.89811195G>T]; Pfibrosis = 
2.2×10−11, PCOPD = 1.9×10−7). We performed additional analysis to investigate genetic 
overlap using gwas-pw37 (see Supplementary Note). We confirmed overlap at the DSP and 
FAM13A loci with a posterior probability of > 0.99, and additionally discovered overlap 
near MAPT/KANSL1 (top fibrosis SNP8, rs1981997 [NC_000017.10:g.44056767G>A]; 
Pfibrosis = 8.87×10−14, PCOPD = 4.5×10−3) with posterior probability of 0.84. While the 
MAPT/KANSL1 locus did not reach genome-wide significance in our study, we note its 
independent discovery in a genome-wide association in extremes of lung function7. Notably, 
for all four of these variants (in DSP [2], FAM13A, and MAPT), the fibrosis risk allele is 
protective for development of COPD. Emphysema, a key component of COPD, and 
pulmonary fibrosis are both smoking-related lung diseases that have both shared and distinct 
pathophysiology38–40, though genetic loci with opposing effects have not been previously 
described. Additional investigation of these loci as a well as a more comprehensive 
assessment of genetic overlap of COPD and pulmonary fibrosis may lead to insight into both 
disorders.

 Because our analysis relied on a spirometric definition of COPD alone, we did not 
specifically exclude other causes of airway obstruction such as asthma, which can overlap 
with COPD in adults41. To define COPD, we used pre-bronchodilator spirometry, which was 
available across all cohorts, and we included at least moderately affected cases (FEV1 < 80% 
predicted). We examined the top set of genome-wide significant results in a subset of our 
largest cohorts with both pre- and post-bronchodilator data and densely imputed genotypes; 
overall, the effect sizes (mean difference = 0.001) and P values (mean log10 P value 
difference = 0.18) were similar (Supplementary Table 13 and Supplementary Figures 4 and 
5). In addition, a recent GWAS of FEV1, FVC, and FEV1/FVC did not find substantial 
differences including and excluding subjects with asthma7. In the 79 variants tested in Stage 
2, we found no significant difference in the OR for COPD association when including and 
excluding individuals with asthma (Supplementary Figure 6).
We examined COPD associations of genome-wide significant asthma (and asthma-
associated traits) loci from the NHGRI-EBI GWAS Catalog42 (Supplementary Table 14). We 
also compared our COPD association results to the GABRIEL asthma study43 
(Supplementary Tables 15). None of the genome-wide significant loci from asthma and 
COPD overlapped. Further, no asthma or COPD loci showed Bonferroni-adjusted (for 
number of look-ups) significant association with the other disease, though several loci 
showed nominal (P<0.05) significance. The 16p11.2 (CCDC101) locus has been described 
in the joint susceptibility to asthma and obesity10. COPD susceptibility is strongly related to 
cigarette smoking. Two of our loci (15q25 and 19q13) have been previously associated with 
smoking behavior44,45, though we found no additional evidence of overlap in genome-wide 
significant variants described in the NHGRI-EBI GWAS Catalog42 and Tobacco and 
Genetics Consortium GWAS45 (Supplementary Tables 16–18). We additionally evaluated 
overlap of our top 22 loci with COPD comorbidities (Supplementary Table 19) and 
radiographic imaging features (Supplementary Table 20).
In contrast to minimal overlap in genome-wide significant results with asthma and smoking, 
we discovered a significant overall genetic correlation of COPD with asthma (rgenetic = 0.38, 
P = 6.2×10−5) using LD score regression in our European-ancestry subjects46,47. We also 
assessed genetic correlation with population-based lung function, pulmonary fibrosis, 
smoking behavior, and two common COPD comorbidities, coronary artery disease and 
osteoporosis. We identified significant correlation of COPD with lung function and two 
aspects of smoking behavior, but not with common comorbidities or with pulmonary fibrosis 
(Figure 4). The lack of significant correlation of COPD with pulmonary fibrosis may 
indicate our overlapping loci for COPD and pulmonary fibrosis are not representative of a 
broader disease correlation; alternatively, it could reflect limited sample size or a mix of 
positive and negative genetic correlations across the genome for the diseases. In potential 
support of this latter hypothesis, and in contrast to the loci we describe in this study, are 
recent descriptions of rare variants in telomerase genes predisposing to both emphysema, a 
key feature of COPD, and pulmonary fibrosis40,48. Our analysis of partitioned heritability 
identified COPD genetic association enrichment in fetal lung tissue (coefficient P = 
3.5×10−7); other bioinformatics analyses also support functional annotation of COPD 
associations to lung tissue or lung cell types (Supplementary Note).

 Our study is, to our knowledge, the largest genome-wide association study of COPD cases to 
date and includes over 60,000 subjects (including 15,256 COPD cases) in the Stage 1 
analysis. We chose to combine subjects of different ethnicities, hypothesizing that shared 
COPD risk factors across ethnicities would outweigh power loss due to heterogeneity. While 
methods have been developed that can more rigorously assess the degree of overlap and 
provide additional power in this setting49, none of our non-white cohorts were sufficiently 
sized or powered for these analyses. COPD is also a highly heterogeneous disease; whether 
a more precise phenotypic definition would result in greater power is not clear. We used a 
staged study design and examined overall meta-analysis P-values to determine genome-wide 
significance. Thus, 9 loci (TET2, CFDP1, TGFB2, AGER, ARMC2, PID1, MTCL1, 
SFTPD, and CYP2A6) from our Stage 1 analysis, which only reached genome-wide 
significance in either the Stage 2 UK BiLEVE analysis or the overall meta-analysis, should 
be further replicated. However, six of these 9 association signals are significant if we 
consider a Bonferroni correction (P < 6.3×10−4) for the 79 variants tested in Stage 2. 
Further, 8 of these 9 variants are more strongly associated in the overall meta-analysis 
compared to Stage 1; the exception is RARB, which has a previously reported association 
with both lung function4 and airflow obstruction21 (Table 1).
The majority of our significant loci overlap with lung function loci, strengthening the 
foundation for investigating the relationship of lung function variability in the general 
population to risk of developing COPD. These loci are unlikely to reflect susceptibility for 
asthma or for cigarette smoking; however, our association results as a whole show evidence 
of shared heritability with asthma (supporting investigation into shared genetic etiologies for 
these diseases) and cigarette smoking behavior (despite adjustment for smoking in our 
statistical model). We identified functional annotation enrichment for fetal lung cells, 
supporting a role for early life events contributing to future risk of COPD. Finally, we 
identify loci that overlap with pulmonary fibrosis, but with opposite risk alleles. Our study 
highlights the important contribution of genetic association studies to understanding COPD, 
not only by identifying novel loci, but also illustrating relationships with other pulmonary 
traits and diseases.

Online Methods
Study Cohorts
We invited investigators from 22 studies with genome-wide association data and COPD 
case-control or general population samples with spirometry to participate in a genome-wide 
association meta-analysis. Additionally, we included four cohorts with Illumina 
HumanExome v1.2 and custom genotyping based primarily on prior top results from a

 previously published COPD GWAS13, using results with P < 1×10−4 using plink ‘–clump’ 
on the COPDGene non-Hispanic whites to perform linkage disequilibrium pruning (r2 < 
0.8), preferentially retaining both an imputed and genotyped top SNP at each locus. An 
additional group of variants was a candidate panel, based on results from a previous 
candidate gene analysis54, as well as variants identified in association with lung function 
(supplementing the existing content on the array, which included variants from previous 
genome-wide association studies), including the lead SNP and a 200kb region around that 
SNP pruned for variants with P < 0.01 and r2 < 0.8, and additional top-ranked SNPs for 
COPDGene-specific analyses for lung function, bronchodilator responsiveness, 
exacerbations, and SNPs from candidate genes.
The baseline characteristics of these 26 cohorts can be seen in Supplementary Table 1. Each 
cohort obtained approval from appropriate ethical/regulatory bodies; informed consent was 
obtained for all individuals. (Further cohort-specific methods can be found in the Data 
Supplement.) As most of these cohorts did not have post-bronchodilator spirometry, we used 
a modified definition of GOLD criteria based on pre-bronchodilator spirometry: forced 
expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) < 80% and FEV1 to forced vital capacity (FVC) ratio 
of < 0.7 for cases, and FEV1 > 80% and FEV1/FVC > 0.7 for controls. Logistic regression 
was performed in each cohort, adjusting for age, sex, pack-years of smoking, ever-smoking 
status, current-smoking status, and ancestry-based principal components, as appropriate for 
each study. Summary statistics were assessed using EasyQC55 version 10.1. More detailed 
cohort information, including cohort-specific methods, can be found in the Supplementary 
Note.
Genome-wide association quality control
Summary statistics, including effect allele and other allele oriented to the + strand, effect 
allele frequency, chromosome and position (hg19), and imputation quality were uploaded to 
a secure site at the Brigham and Women’s Hospital/Channing Division of Network 
Medicine. Quality control assessments included assessing allele frequencies versus 1000 
Genomes reference, standard error versus sample size, and quantile-quantile plots. Variants 
with an imputation quality metric of < 0.3 (provided a higher threshold for imputation 
quality was not already implemented), a minor allele count (MAC) of < 20 using the 
effective sample size or the number of cases and adjusted for imputation quality where 
applicable, were set to missing. Variants were included for meta-analysis if they were 
present in at least 13 studies (those with European ancestry and at least 7 million markers 
passing all quality control filters).
Staged GWAS meta-analysis
In Stage 1 of the analysis, we used Metal56,57 version 2011-03-25 to perform a fixed-effects 
meta-analysis of genome-wide data from 22 studies and four additional COPD cohorts 
genotyped on an Illumina HumanExome v1.2 platform with custom content; this content 
included a set of COPD candidate genes and regions identified from prior COPD GWAS 
efforts13. We adjusted for inflation using genomic control correction in each study. We 
included study populations with subjects of non-European ancestry in the overall analysis, 
and additionally examined results limited to study populations of European ancestry. To

 identify variants to test for association in Stage 2 in the UK BiLEVE study, we selected top 
results (P < 5×10−6) from the Stage 1 meta-analysis. We selected one lead variant from the 
chromosome 15q25, FAM13, and HHIP regions, as all of these have been described in 
multiple COPD GWASs13,16,17,21. For the remainder of the regions, we performed linkage 
disequilibrium pruning using the PLINK1.9 –clump procedure with an r2 of 0.5, additionally 
examining these SNPs for the number of cohorts with passing quality control at each variant 
and including SNPs in strong LD (i.e., part of the same clump) with a lower degree of 
missingness. To identify independent results, we used GCTA-COJO58,59 on the Stage 1 
meta-analysis for variants with P < 5×10−6 using the default distance of 10Mb. We used the 
COPDGene non-Hispanic whites (as the largest representative population) as the reference 
population for these analyses. An overall meta-analysis across the Stage 1 and Stage 2 (UK 
BiLEVE) cohorts was performed and variants with P < 5×10−8 were considered genome-
wide significant (Figure 1).
Lung eQTL analysis
Lung expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) were calculated from 1,111 human subjects 
who underwent lung surgery at three academic sites, Laval University, University of British 
Columbia (UBC), and University of Groningen, henceforth referred to as Laval, UBC, and 
Groningen, respectively. This lung eQTL dataset has been described previously22,60. Briefly, 
66.7% to 91.2% of the individuals in this study were current or former smokers and 24.2% 
to 35.3% had moderate to severe COPD (GOLD spirometry grade 2 to 4). Whole-genome 
gene expression profiling in the lung was performed on a custom Affymetrix array 
(GPL10379). Microarray pre-processing and quality controls were described 
previously22,61,62. Probe sequences were mapped to the human genome (hg19) using 
Bowtie63 and probes not mapping to a coding region or having a common SNP (MAF ≥ 5%) 
in their sequence were removed. Expression data were adjusted for age, sex, and smoking 
status using residuals obtained with the robust fitting of linear models function (rlm) in the R 
statistical package MASS. Residual values deviating from the median by more than three 
standard deviations were filtered as outliers. Genotyping was carried on the Illumina Human 
1M-Duo BeadChip array.
Twenty-one out of the 22 SNPs (in main manuscript Table 1) were genotyped or imputed in 
the three cohorts, i.e. Laval, UBC, and Groningen. One of the SNPs, rs7186831, was not 
well-imputed; a proxy, rs11865296 in modest linkage disequilibrium (r2 = 0.54, 1000 
genomes phase 3, EUR) was used instead. These variants were tested for association with 
adjusted expression traits (43,465 probe sets) in the lung. SNPs within 1 Mb up and 
downstream of the transcription probe set were considered as local-eQTL. Distant-acting 
eQTLs were further than 1 Mb away or on a different chromosome. Association tests were 
carried with PLINK1.964,65 in each cohort and then meta-analyzed using Fisher’s method. 
All local eQTL with nominal P value < 0.05 in the meta-analysis were considered. To 
provide an additional overall estimate of eQTL significance, we considered a Bonferroni 
correction threshold ([0.05/(22 SNPs × 43,465 probe sets) = P value < 5.2 × 10−8]). 
Statistical analyses were performed in R3.2.366.

 Co-localization Analysis
Co-localization of statistical signals between COPD genetic association and eQTL were 
examined using the coloc R package23. We used phenotypic summary statistics from 
individuals of European ancestry with genome-wide association data and all eQTL results 
and examined 500kb flanks around the top 22 genome-wide significant associations found in 
the overall meta-analysis (Table 1).
Sensitivity Analysis
To estimate the effect of using pre- instead of post-bronchodilator lung function on our 
results, we examined the top set of genome-wide significant results in our largest cohorts 
with both pre- and post-bronchodilator data and densely imputed genotypes (COPDGene 
NHW and AA, ECLIPSE, NETT-NAS, and Norway/GenKOLS). Since subjects from these 
cohorts (except for COPDGene) were included based on post-bronchodilator values, 
including all subjects with COPD based on post-bronchodilator spirometry would lead to 
larger sample sizes and make comparison of P-values more difficult. Thus, we chose a 
random sample of post-bronchodilator cases and controls that matched the number of pre-
bronchodilator cases and controls. We performed logistic regression using these equal sized 
set of pre- and post-bronchodilator cohorts, and meta-analyzed the results.
Asthma overlap analysis
We assessed the overlap between our results and known asthma susceptibility loci. We 
downloaded information on genome-wide significant (P < 5×10−8) associations with asthma 
and asthma-related traits including asthma and hay fever, asthma (childhood onset), asthma 
(corticosteroid response), bronchodilator response in asthma, pulmonary function decline, 
and severe asthma in the NHGRI-EBI GWAS Catalog42. Additionally, we examined top 
associated variants (which were not genome-wide significant) in the susceptibility to the 
asthma-COPD overlap syndrome67. In all, we assessed the association statistics of 49 unique 
asthma-associated trait loci across 26 genomic regions in our Stage 1 meta-analysis results. 
We also examined the asthma association statistics of our top COPD loci from overall meta-
analysis using publically available asthma GWAS data from the GABRIEL Consortium43. 
For COPD loci not present in the GABRIEL Consortium asthma GWAS data, we attempted 
to examine proxy SNPs in LD (r2 > 0.5, 1000 genomes phase 1 CEU) with our top COPD 
loci.
To examine the genetic correlation47 of COPD and asthma over the entire genome, we 
performed LD score regression46 using summary statistics from publically available asthma 
GWAS data from the GABRIEL Consortium43. For all comparisons using LD score 
regression, we filtered to HapMap3 variants, limited to European-ancestry subjects with 
genome-wide data, and filtered on missingness using default parameters in 
munge_sumstats.py. For the GABRIEL data, we required a variant to be present in at least 
35 of the studies.
Smoking behavior overlap analysis
We downloaded information on genome-wide significant (P < 5×10−8) associations with the 
traits “nicotine dependence” and “smoking behaviour” in the NHGRI-EBI GWAS Catalog42.

 We assessed these top smoking-associated SNPs in our Stage 1 meta-analysis results. We 
also assessed overlap of smoking and COPD in the publically available summary statistics 
from the 2010 Tobacco and Genetics Consortium GWAS45. We evaluated our top COPD loci 
associations from overall meta-analysis with both cigarettes per day and ever-smoking traits. 
For COPD risk SNPs not directly analyzed in the Tobacco and Genetics Consortium GWAS, 
we attempted to examine proxy SNPs in LD (r2 > 0.5, 1000 genomes phase1 CEU) with our 
top COPD loci.
To examine the genetic correlation47 of COPD and smoking behaviours (cigarettes per day 
and ever-smoking status) over the entire genome, we performed LD score regression46 using 
summary statistics from our current COPD study as noted above and publically available 
summary statistics from the 2010 Tobacco and Genetics Consortium GWAS45.
Fine mapping analysis
We attempted to determine, at each locus, whether we could identify a potentially causal 
variant. We performed these analyses using European ancestry subjects alone, and in all 
subjects with genome-wide data, and excluded variants that were not present in at least 80% 
of the full sample. We assumed a single causal variant at each locus, examined a +/− 250kb 
region around the top variant, and calculated approximate Bayes factors using the method of 
Wakefield68 to determine the 95% credible set. While specific trans-ethnic mapping 
approaches69,70 can significantly assist in identifying causal loci, we found that the number 
of non-European samples in our study were likely insufficient to leverage these methods.
Functional enrichment analysis
To identify enriched cell types for our COPD associations, we applied LD score regression 
to GenoSkyline71 lung tissue annotations (the default LD score regression annotations 
collapse lung into the cardiovascular tissue type), as well as cell-type specific annotations 
from LD score regression46. We also performed analysis using only the 22 genome-wide 
significant loci and tested for enrichment of imputed chromatin marks from ROADMAP 
using HaploReg 4.129. Further, we applied a more sophisticated analysis adjusting for local 
linkage disequilibrium patterns, GoShifter72. Finally, we examined overlap with gene 
expression datasets using SNPsea73.
Additional pulmonary fibrosis and COPD overlap analysis
To further examine overlapping loci for COPD and pulmonary fibrosis, we combined 
summary statistics from our study and the pulmonary fibrosis GWAS by Fingerlin et al.8,9 
using gwas-pw37.
Causal gene analysis
For the genome-wide significant loci from the overall meta-analysis, we explored potential 
causative genes at each association locus using the PrixFixe method74, assuming co-function 
of all significant loci. As required by the PrixFixe method, we assured our genome-wide 
significant loci were present in dbSNP v13775 and were represented HapMap76 phase III 
data; for loci not meeting these requirements, proxy SNPs from HapMap phase III were

 selected based on strongest LD (r2) with index SNP (see Supplementary Table 11 for details 
of the proxy variant used at each genome-wide significant locus).
COPD comorbidity overlap analysis
We assessed the overlap between our results and two common COPD comorbidities, 
coronary artery disease and osteoporosis (through bone mineral density traits). We 
downloaded information on genome-wide significant (P < 5×10−8) associations with these 
comorbidities as reported in the NHGRI-EBI GWAS Catalog42. We assessed the association 
statistics of these comorbid trait loci in our Stage 1 meta-analysis results.
Quantitative imaging overlap analysis
To explore the relationship between our top COPD-associated variants and imaging features 
of emphysema and airway thickness, we queried data from a GWAS of COPD quantitative 
imaging features77. For each genome-wide significant COPD susceptibility locus in our 
overall meta-analysis, we assessed the corresponding quantitative imaging GWAS effect 
size, effect direction, and P value for association with the following quantitative imaging 
traits: %LAA-950 (percentage low attenuation area, using a threshold of −950 Hounsfield 
units); Perc15 (value of Hounsfield units at the 15th percentile of the density histogram); 
Pi10 (airway wall area: the value for a hypothetical airway of 10 mm internal perimeter 
obtained by plotting a regression line of the square root of the airway wall area versus the 
airway internal perimeter); and WAP (percentage of the wall area compared to the total 
bronchial area).
Gene set enrichment analysis
As an attempt to minimize false positives in our gene set enrichment analysis, we divided the 
Stage 1 GWAS cohorts with full genome-wide data into two sets of roughly equal size. We 
then used i-GSEA4GWAS (http://gsea4gwas.psych.ac.cn/)78 for each of the two GWAS data 
sets to assess enrichment of COPD GWAS loci in BioCarta (http://cgap.nci.nih.gov/
Pathways/BioCarta_Pathways) and KEGG79 pathways as well as gene ontology (GO) 
terms80,81. We first evaluated GO terms and pathways with a false-discovery rate (FDR) less 
than 5% in both analysis sets and then used a more stringent threshold of FDR < 1% to 
evaluate overlap of GO term and pathway enrichment in our two analysis sets.
