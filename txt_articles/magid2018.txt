lobally, men in wealthy, developed regions generally have 
higher testosterone than those living in less affluent ones1–3. 
While some researchers link such variation to ‘ethnic’
, ‘racial’ 
or genetic traits4–6, ecological and behavioural variables associ-
ated with energy availability, such as abundant nutritional intake, 
pathogen load and sedentary lifestyles, also potentially contrib-
ute to interpopulation differences in reproductive phenotypes7–12. 
Developmental exposure to energetic variables during childhood 
may further explain adult variation in reproductive steroid hormones. 
Evidence supporting this ‘developmental hypothesis’ connects early 
infancy, pre-birth or childhood experience with sex steroid levels in 
later infancy13,14, developmental timing as measured by adult height 
and pubertal age15–18, or adult reproductive function3,18–21.
Migration studies support the developmental hypothesis. 
Children migrating from less to more affluent regions show rapid 
postnatal growth and earlier sexual maturation19,22,23. Levels of 
salivary progesterone, ovulation rates and menopausal age of 
Bangladeshi women who reached adulthood in more ecologically 
constrained environments were lower compared with those who 
migrated to a less challenging one19,24,25, and early-childhood migra-
tion (age 0–8 versus 9–16 years) was associated with more robust 
ovarian function19,23.
We lack comparable migrant studies among men, but—based 
on the above findings—we predicted that men with different life 
histories would express varying degrees of reproductive investment 
depending on differential developmental conditions. We expected 
that males encountering improved ecologies before or during devel-
opmental transitions would invest in more costly reproductive effort 
associated with competition and/or sexual signalling, mediated by 
testosterone26–28. Based on ecological developmental histories, we 
presumed that individual trade-offs between testosterone-mediated 
traits and other energetic demands would lead to population-level 
differences. Considering male variation in reproductive function, 
hormonal variations in non-clinical populations are unlikely to 
impact fecundity29,30, but instead relate to trade-offs between traits 
associated with survivorship and reproductive effort2,3,31–34.
We therefore designed a cross-cultural study to distinguish 
whether global variations in male reproductive phenotypes (mea-
sured by salivary testosterone levels, pubertal age and stature) 
reflect: (1) developmentally plastic, organizational responses to 
childhood ecology or (2) current, activational responses to local 
ecology. We selected a generally homogenous, ethno-cultural group 
of Bangladeshis of Bengali ethnic origin, some of whom migrated 
from a less to more affluent region (specifically, Sylhet, northeast 
Bangladesh to London, United Kingdom).
We assumed that there would be fewer ecological constraints on 
males in the United Kingdom compared with Bangladesh. Despite 
improvements, Bangladesh still ranks globally among the poor-
est quartile of countries, with high indicators of maternal under-
nutrition and stunting (36%) among children aged < 
5 years35,36. 
However, the Bangladeshi populations studied here originate from 
the land-owning, middle-class not normally subject to nutritional

Male reproductive investment is energetically costly, and measures of human reproductive steroid hormones (testosterone), 
developmental tempo (pubertal timing) and growth (stature) correlate with local ecologies at the population level. It is unclear 
whether male reproductive investment in later life is ‘set’ during childhood development, mediated through adulthood, or var-
ies by ethnicity. Applying a life-course model to Bangladeshi migrants to the United Kingdom, here we investigate plasticity in 
human male reproductive function resulting from childhood developmental conditions. We hypothesized that childhood ecol-
ogy shapes adult trade-offs between reproductive investment and/or other fitness-related traits. We predicted correspondence 
between these traits and developmental timing of exposure to ecological constraints (Bangladesh) or conditions of surplus 
(United Kingdom). We compared: Bangladesh sedentees (n = 
 107); Bangladeshi men who migrated in childhood to the United 
Kingdom (n = 
 59); migrants who arrived in adulthood (n = 
 75); second-generation UK-born and raised children of Bangladeshi 
migrants (n = 
 56); and UK-born ethnic Europeans (n = 
 62). Migration before puberty predicted higher testosterone and an 
earlier recalled pubertal age compared with Bangladeshi sedentees or adult migrants, with more pronounced differences in 
men who arrived before the age of eight. Second-generation Bangladeshis were taller, with higher testosterone than sedentees 
and adult migrants, and higher waking testosterone than Europeans. Age-related testosterone profiles varied by group, declin-
ing in UK migrants, increasing in sedentees, and having no significant relationship within UK-born groups. We conclude that 
male reproductive function apparently remains plastic late into childhood, is independent of Bengali or European ethnicity, and 
shapes physiological trade-offs later in life.

or energetic constraints. Instead, they contrast with migrants in 
developmental exposure to infectious and/or parasitic diseases and 
environmental instability (that is, political unrest, periodic flooding, 
and poor public health provision and sanitation)37,38, which cross 
social and economic boundaries37,39–42. Limitations on energy avail-
ability during growth can lead to trade-offs in reproductive func-
tion7,11,12,24,25. In London, migrants join other British Bangladeshis, 
65% of whom are classified as living in income poverty, which is 
higher than for other UK ethnic groups43.
We selected timing of migration as a dependent variable (encom-
passing developmental exposure to environments with abundant 
resources) to predict hormonal (salivary testosterone) and matu-
rational/growth (recall of pubertal timing and standing height) 
markers of adult reproductive function. Developmental milestones 
of birth, middle childhood (concurrent with adrenarche: the pre-
pubertal adrenal secretion of androgens) and puberty informed our 
hypotheses. Groups comprised: (1) ‘sedentees’ (men who never left 
Sylhet); (2) ‘adult migrants’ (British Bangladeshis from Sylhet who 
migrated as adults (post-puberty) to London, United Kingdom); (3) 
‘child migrants’ (British Bangladeshis who migrated to the United 
Kingdom as children (aged ≤ 
19 years)); (4) ‘second-generation 
migrants’ (UK-resident Bangladeshis born and raised in the United 
Kingdom, with parents originating from Sylhet); and (5) ‘British 
Europeans’ (UK-born men of European ethnicity who grew up in 
the United Kingdom and reside in similar neighbourhoods and 
socioeconomic conditions as the migrants).
We tested two childhood developmental hypotheses. First, that 
men who experienced fewer ecological constraints before puberty 
express greater adult reproductive investment than men with more 
constrained childhood experiences. The second hypothesis refined 
the first, focusing on early childhood before the age of nine, and 
proposing that fewer ecological constraints experienced between 
birth and eight years would lead to greater adult reproductive invest-
ment compared with men with more constrained early-childhood 
experiences. Both hypotheses predicted that, compared with adult 
migrants and sedentees, men who grew up in the United Kingdom 
would have: (1) significantly higher levels of salivary testosterone; 
(2) earlier recalled age markers of puberty44; and (3) greater stature.
Our third, non-childhood developmental hypothesis proposed 
that adult male reproductive traits (for example, salivary testoster-
one) remain plastic during the life course, reflecting either cumula-
tive exposure to adult ecological conditions or responses to current, 
local ecology. This predicted: (1) significantly higher salivary tes-
tosterone in adult migrants compared with sedentees; and (2) cor-
relation within adult migrants between the number of years spent 
in the United Kingdom and salivary testosterone, adjusting for age.
Our final, non-developmental hypothesis proposed that biologi-
cal and cultural traits associated with ethnicity explain interpopu-
lation variations in reproductive traits. This predicted: (1) higher 
salivary testosterone; and (2) an earlier age at puberty and taller 
stature in UK-born British Europeans compared with second- 
generation British Bangladeshis.
Results
Table 1 presents descriptive statistics for all groups. Adult migrants 
were significantly older than all other groups, averaging 48.4 years 
(95% confidence interval (CI) = 44.6 to 52.3). Second-generation 
men were the youngest, averaging 24.5 years (95% CI = 22.5 to 25.8). 
Age at migration and recruitment correlated for child migrants 
(Pearson’s correlation coefficient (r) = 0.44, t = 3.3, d.f. = 46, 
P = 0.001), but not adult migrants (r = 0.13, t = 1.0, d.f. = 62, P = 0.3). 
Men who arrived aged < 
9 years were younger at recruitment than 
those who arrived aged 9–19 (28.0 and 36.9 years, respectively; 
t = 3.1, d.f. = 33.6, P = 0.004).
Compared with sedentees, British Europeans and all migrants 
were significantly taller (except adult migrants) and heavier, with 
higher body mass indices (BMIs) (Table 1). Age at recruitment 
negatively predicted the height of child migrants (n = 40) compared 
with sedentees (regression coefficient of population (β 
) = − 
0.379 
s.d., 95% CI = − 
0.749 to − 
0.008, n = 106, P = 
 0.045), while no signif-
icant secular trends for height were observed within other residence 
groups (Fig. 1). Across all groups, older men recalled reach-
ing puberty later (β = 0.28 s.d., 95% CI = 0.155 to 0.410, n = 237, 
P = 
 0.00002). After correcting for age at recruitment, men with 
higher salivary testosterone recalled reaching puberty earlier (wak-
ing: β = − 
0.172 s.d., 95% CI = − 
0.301 to − 
0.044, n = 219, P = 0.01; 
evening: β = − 
0.130 s.d., 95% CI = − 
0.258 to − 
0.003, n = 220, 
P = 
 0.047; Supplementary Table 10). However, no such relationship 
was observed when restricting the same analysis to Bangladeshis 
resident in the United Kingdom or only to sedentees. All intergroup 
regressions included age at recruitment and all salivary testoster-
one analyses included BMI as covariates, with established predictive 
relationships with adult testosterone34,45–49. Testosterone regressions 
confined to child migrants included BMI imputed at the popula-
tion mean (23.9 for n = 8, 24% of cases), and were replicated with 
complete cases.
Regression findings supported both childhood developmental 
hypotheses and their associated predictions with few exceptions, 
while the third and fourth hypotheses based on adult ecology or 
ethnicity were largely not supported (Table 2). The experience of 
UK ecological conditions before adulthood led to higher testos-
terone, an earlier age at puberty and taller stature compared with 
men who experienced similar conditions after puberty. Second-
generation men who spent all of their childhood in the United 
Kingdom had the highest waking (153.5 pg ml–1, 95% CI = 133.8 to 
173.2, n = 25) and evening (119.4 pg ml–1, 95% CI = 98.3 to 140.5, 
n = 28) salivary testosterone of any group (Fig. 2), significantly 
higher than adult migrants (waking: 90.7 pg ml–1, 95% CI = 80.7 
to 100.7, n = 53 P = 0.0001; evening: 75.0 pg ml–1, 95% CI = 65.5 to 
83.5, n = 53 P = 0.03) and sedentees (waking: 100.9 pg ml–1, 95% 
CI = 91.4 to 110.4, n = 103, P = 0.0002; evening: 76.2 pg ml–1, 95% 
CI = 68.3 to 84.2, n = 102, P = 0.007). Child migrants had the sec-
ond highest salivary testosterone levels, which were higher for 
waking (141.4 pg ml–1, 95% CI = 119.2 to 163.5, n = 26) and eve-
ning (100.1 pg ml–1, 95% CI = 84.6 to 115.7, n = 27) samples than 
sedentees (P = 0.002 and P = 0.02, respectively) and adult migrants 
(P = 0.0003 and P = 0.07, respectively).
Age at migration predicted an earlier recalled age at puberty for 
migrants who arrived before completing puberty (≤ 
 age 19), but not 
for those who migrated as adults (Fig. 3); however, this relationship 
was not significant in child migrants after including recruitment 
age in the model (β = 
 1.10 s.d., 95% CI = − 
0.106 to 2.30, n = 19, 
P = 0.071). Both child migrants (15.8 years, 95% CI = 14.5 to 17.1, 
n = 
 19) and second-generation men (14.2 years, 95% CI = 13.5 to 
14.8, n = 21) recalled earlier ages at puberty compared with seden-
tees (16.1 years, 95% CI = 
 15.7 to 16.5, n = 
 103) and adult migrants 
(16.4 years, 95% CI = 
 15.9 to 16.9, n = 
 49), but these differences 
were only significant for the second-generation men (P = 0.003 and 
P = 0.02, respectively; Table 2). Similarly, second-generation men 
(n = 
 49) averaged 8.6 cm (95% CI = 
 6.6 to 10.7, n = 106, P = 4–15) 
taller than sedentees and 7.1 cm (95% CI = 
 4.0 to 10.2, n = 65, 
P = 0.0001) taller than adult migrants, while child migrants (n = 44) 
averaged 4.3 cm (95% CI = 2.2 to 6.5, P = 0.0007) taller than seden-
tees, and a non-significant 2.8 cm (95% CI = − 
0.4 to 6.0, P = 0.12) 
taller than adult migrants.
Ecological conditions in the United Kingdom predicted higher 
testosterone, an earlier age at puberty and taller stature if experi-
enced during early childhood (ages 0–8 years) compared with men 
only exposed to these conditions in middle childhood and puberty 
(> 
9 years). Within child migrants, age at migration negatively pre-
dicted evening salivary testosterone independent of the number 
of years spent in the United Kingdom (waking: β = −

s.d., 95% CI = − 
1.480 to − 
0.380, n = 34, P = 0.003; Supplementary 
Table 2), and infant or early-childhood migrants had significantly 
higher evening salivary testosterone compared with late-child-
hood migrants (9–19 years) (Fig. 4 and Supplementary Fig. 1), 
although the difference was not significant when adjustments were 
made for recruitment age (Supplementary Table 4). Migration 
between birth and age 9 (n = 8) predicted earlier recalled age at 
puberty compared with migration at > 
19 years (β = − 
0.858 s.d., 
95% CI = − 
1.637 to − 
0.079, n = 40, P = 0.034; Supplementary 
Table 6), but not compared with migration between 9 and 19 years 
 
(β = − 
0.919 s.d., 95% CI = − 
1.96 to 0.121, n = 20, P = 0.10). 
Combining second-generation and child migrants, exposure to 
UK conditions from before birth to age 9 (n = 29) predicted an 
earlier age of puberty compared with UK migrants who moved 
between the ages of 9 and 19 years (β = − 
0.969 s.d., 95% CI = 
 
− 
1.675 to − 
0.264, P = 0.004) or after the age of 19 (β = − 
0.909 s.d., 
95% CI = − 
1.495 to − 
0.322, P = 0.003).
Child migrants were taller if they migrated earlier. Age of migra-
tion predicted the adult height of child migrants after adjusting for 
the number of years in the United Kingdom (β = − 
0.719 s.d., 95% 
CI = − 
1.22 to − 
0.217, n = 37, P = 
 0.009; Supplementary Table 11), 
although there were no significant predictors of height when adjust-
ing instead for recruitment age (Supplementary Table 12).
The experience of ecological conditions in the United Kingdom 
at any point during adulthood did not lead to higher testosterone. 
Instead, the waking salivary testosterone levels of adult migrants 
were significantly lower than those of sedentees, suggesting fixation

of this trait in relation to ecological conditions at some point before 
adulthood, or even an opposite directional effect to that seen in 
child migrants (Table 1). Moreover, the number of adult years spent 
in the United Kingdom correlated negatively with salivary testos-
terone (waking: β = −

0.024 s.d., 95% CI = − 
0.036 to − 
0.011, 
n = 56, P = 
 0.0005), while age at adult migration failed to show a 
relationship with testosterone (waking: β = − 
0.061 s.d., 95% CI =

to 0.207, P = 0.5; Supplementary Table 7).
Characteristics distinctive to European ethnicity failed to predict 
higher salivary testosterone or earlier age at puberty compared with 
Bengalis sharing similar developmental histories. Instead, waking 
testosterone levels of British Europeans (n = 
 44) were marginally 
lower than for second-generation migrants (β = − 
0.78 s.d., 95% 
CI = 0.102 to 1.46, n = 25, P = 0.02) and no higher than sedentees or 
child or adult migrants at waking or in the evening (Fig. 2, Table 2  
and Supplementary Table 1). The recalled age at puberty did not 
differ between British-European and second-generation British-
Bangladeshi men, but was significantly earlier in Europeans com-
pared with all other groups (Table 2). While British Europeans were 
5.6 cm taller than second-generation migrants (95% CI = 
 8.1 to 2.4; 
P = 
 0.00002), this difference was smaller compared with the other 
ethnic Bengali groups.
Across populations, waking and evening salivary testosterone 
values declined by age at recruitment. Adjusting for BMI, these 
declines were − 
0.79 (95% CI = − 
1.22 to − 
0.357, n = 251, P = 0.001) 
and − 
0.55 (95% CI = − 
0.949 to − 
0.156, n = 254, P = 0.01) pg ml–1 yr–1, 
 
respectively. The relationship between age and salivary testosterone 
varied by residence group. Salivary testosterone levels declined with 
age in child and adult migrants, the relationship was non-significant 
in both UK-born groups, and testosterone levels increased with age 
in sedentees (Supplementary Fig. 1 and Supplementary Table 9). 
Within UK-resident groups, child migrants (n = 
 34) showed a more 
pronounced age-related decline in waking salivary testosterone 
 
than Europeans (β = − 
0.50 s.d., 95% CI = − 
0.952 to −

n = 44, P = 0.01). As a pooled group, men born in the United 
Kingdom had a significant decline in waking (−

Reanalysis performed on men aged ≤ 
40 years at recruitment 
and replication of the child migrant regressions applying multiple 
imputation methods for BMI yielded substantially similar findings 
to those performed with mean imputation and either supported or 
failed to contradict findings within the full cohort (Supplementary 
Section 5 details both reanalyses).
Discussion
Both childhood developmental hypotheses and predictions were 
supported: Bangladeshi men who migrated from Sylhet (with 
greater ecological risks, higher exposure to infectious diseases and 
poorer healthcare) to London during childhood had higher levels of 
adult salivary testosterone, an earlier age at puberty and taller stat-
ure compared with men who completed their childhood in Sylhet. 
Differences were particularly marked if individuals migrated in 
early childhood, aged 0–8 years, and most pronounced for second-
generation British Bangladeshis. We conclude that variations in 
male reproductive phenotype are explained, in this case, by exposure 
 
to less constrained ecological conditions during childhood. Male 
reproductive function apparently remains plastic into late child-
hood and more plastic in early than late childhood.
In contrast, adult exposure to less constrained ecological condi-
tions did not positively influence salivary testosterone. Instead, adult 
migrants to the United Kingdom had lower waking salivary testos-
terone while evening levels were not significantly different from 
non-migrant sedentees. Additionally, the number of adult years in 
the United Kingdom did not positively affect salivary testosterone.
We found partial and contradictory evidence relating male repro-
ductive investment to biological and cultural traits specific to the 
two ethnicities studied. Neighbouring British Europeans with simi-
lar developmental histories and socioeconomic positions to resident 
Bangladeshis did not show greater investment in male reproductive 
traits compared with second-generation British-Bangladeshi men. 
Instead, salivary testosterone was not significantly higher in men 
of European origin compared with any Bengali group, and waking 
samples were marginally lower than in second-generation migrants. 
This unexpected result potentially relates to research linking male 
testosterone to dominance ranking in primates, as well as human 
status interactions, perceived social position, competition, and pro-
visioning or caregiving50–58. While testing for such relationships falls 
outside the scope of the analyses here, further exploration of social 
hypotheses59,60 forms the basis of future study (K.M., R.T.C and 
G.R.B., manuscript in preparation).
While the recalled age of puberty was earlier for British 
Europeans compared with groups born in Bangladesh, this did not 
differ from their UK-born, Bengali counterparts. European men

were taller than all ethnic Bengali groups, but this difference was 
smallest when comparing second-generation migrants, suggesting 
a generational trend towards matching local averages in height—a 
well-documented phenomenon following migration61,62. This sup-
ports the assumption that UK conditions are more conducive to 
childhood growth than Bangladesh conditions.
Patterns of male reproductive ageing varied with childhood and 
adult conditions. The relationship between age and testosterone 
was: (1) significantly different between men who shared childhood 
but not adult conditions (negative for adult migrants and positive 
for sedentees); (2) significantly different between men who shared 
adult but not childhood conditions (steeper for child than adult 
migrants); and (3) not different between men sharing both sets of 
conditions (no significant pattern in second-generation migrants 
and British Europeans). Such variability adds to evidence of the 
non-universality of male age-related testosterone decline, particu-
larly in non-industrialized societies, possibly representing develop-
mental responses to energetic conditions2,8,33,34.

Europeans

decline of UK-born men remains unexpected considering the male 
ageing effects widely documented elsewhere45,46. The serum testos-
terone decline reported in a large, longitudinal study of middle-class 
Caucasian (87%) men in the USA46 equates to − 
2.13 pg ml–1 yr–1  
of salivary testosterone63. Characteristics of the relatively small, 
socioeconomically poor, urban population of UK-born men may 
explain differences between our findings and large-scale epidemio-
logical studies.
Our findings support the conclusion that developmental 
reproductive responses to ecological conditions are most dis-
tinctly expressed in early adulthood2,64 and diurnally at waking65. 
Differences in salivary testosterone between groups were greatest 
in early adulthood, but trended towards convergence around age 40 
(Supplementary Section 2). Migrants experiencing decreased eco-
logical constraints during childhood development had the steepest 
age-related decline, suggesting that early-life improvements lead 
to adjustment of male reproductive function in early adulthood, 
accompanied by rapid decline at later ages.
The above findings lend further support to the ‘developmental 
hypothesis’
, whereby pre-birth, early infancy or childhood con-
ditions influence reproductive development in later infancy13,14, 
developmental transitions to adulthood15–18,66, and adult reproduc-
tive and senescent traits in both women and men18–21. Migration 
during childhood to a less constrained ecology leads to increased 
investment in two proximate measures of male reproductive func-
tion: salivary testosterone and age at puberty. Ecological conditions 
in the United Kingdom during all or part of childhood also lead 
to greater childhood growth, as evidenced by taller stature (Fig. 1). 
 
Child migrants recruited at younger ages were taller, probably 
reflecting developmental effects on growth combined with cohort 
effects of peak migration, as discussed below.
The association of childhood development in the United 
Kingdom with increased male reproductive investment across the 
life course mirrors the results from migrant studies of Bangladeshi 
women that found higher salivary progesterone, higher rates of ovu-
lation, an earlier age at adrenarche and menarche, later menopause, 
and slower reproductive ageing among women who migrated dur-
ing childhood19,23–25.
We interpret population differences in these reproductive traits 
as evolved strategies to balance lifetime investment in reproduction 
against the demands of growth, immunity and maintenance67. From 
this life-history theory perspective, ecological conditions during 
critical phases in the organization of hormonal axes and somatic 
tissues shape investment in reproductive effort at a population level 
in ways that are expressed throughout adulthood. While we selected 
age 8 as an important childhood biosocial threshold68,69 when early 
male hormonal organization becomes set, sufficient plasticity per-
sists into late childhood such that migration to the United Kingdom 
before sexual maturity apparently promotes greater investment in 
phenotypic measures of reproductive effort3.
The differences seen here between child migrant cohorts do 
not argue against gradual linear transitional stages, as opposed to 
punctuated thresholds of sensitivity to ecology at middle childhood 
and adolescence70,71. We split early- and late-childhood migrants 
according to a chronological, not physiological marker, and ecology 
probably influences the timing of physiological transitions, as docu-
mented in migrant girls from Bangladesh to the United Kingdom23, 
and as seen in self-reports of puberty in this population. Moreover, 
cohorts were separated at thresholds when we expected comple-
tion of pre-adrenarche or pre-pubertal development, meaning they 
probably contained individuals who were peri-adrenarcheal or peri-
pubescent at the time of migration, with associated linear trends 
suggesting diminishing organizational effects by chronological age 
at migration.
The selected Bangladeshi communities share dietary, physical 
and cultural practices, and the migrant populations are uniquely 
homogenous in socioeconomics and geography. While these attri-
butes reduce potential sources of variation in male reproductive 
function, cohort differences between migrant groups also limit our 
findings. Demographically, migration of adult Bangladeshi men to 
the United Kingdom peaked in the 1970s, while wives and children 
of adult migrants typically followed in the 1980s72. The average 
recruitment age of adult migrants reflects the 1970s peak. The cor-
relation between age at migration and recruitment in child migrants 
reflects the 1980s peak. The timing of UK family unification limits 
the maximum age of British-born offspring. While we included age 
as a covariate in all models testing for intergroup differences, we 
remain limited in our ability to contrast ecological influences on 
the reproductive function of older males. Moreover, despite screen-
ing for family members of migrants among sedentees, we cannot 
exclude the possibility of a selection bias in our migrant groups.
Retrospective measures of pubertal timing are open to recall 
error, which is likely to be exacerbated by ageing73,74; however, in 
cross-sectional life-course research, combined recall instruments of 
this kind provide limited but internally consistent estimates of rela-
tive maturational rates with low test–retest variation44,75,76. Older men 
recalled later ages at puberty, which may represent a secular trend 
independent of our cohort differences in childhood ecology or sys-
tematic recall/response bias. However, relative differences in develop-
mental cohorts remained evident after including age at recruitment 
as a covariate and restricting our analysis to men aged < 
40 years 
(Supplementary Section 2). Finally, while we propose immunologi-
cal aspects of ecology as a primary explanation for the interpopula-
tion differences observed above, we cannot exclude the possibility 
that the recalled age of puberty, as well as biomarkers of reproductive 
investment, result exclusively from social components of accultura-
tion, stress from discrimination, or perceived threats to status unique 
to growing up as a minority (such as identifying as part of an out-
group)77 or social stimuli from interactions within peer groups.
Based on our study design, we conclude that variation in bio-
markers of reproductive function within Bangladeshi men relate to 
inconsistencies in their ecologies. We consider childhood exposure 
to disease within Bangladesh, as well as the experience of migra-
tion itself, as the most plausible causes of the observed variation. 
Results from British Europeans suggest limits to the biological and 
cultural traits associated with ethnicity in predicting adult male 
reproductive function, and potential differences in the influence 
of social position on the testosterone levels of migrant and non-
migrant men. These findings have implications for life-history 
 
interpretations of reproductive disease and aetiology78, by relat-
ing early-life conditions to prostate cancer or disease79, incorpo-
rating ecological variations to documented health outcomes of

Methods
Study population. Bangladeshis in London and Sylhet form a homogeneous 
ethnic group originating from an affluent socioeconomic position relative to other 
Bangladeshis, share consistency in dietary, religious and social practices, and are 
subject to limited physical work and nutritional stress in either country. Following 
migration to the United Kingdom, access to Bangladeshi foods and community 
cohesion within a geographically condensed region preserves much of this 
homogeneity84. In 2004–2010, we recruited 359 healthy male volunteers aged 17–78 
at completion of the study, screened to exclude thyroid conditions or diabetes. 
First-order relatives were excluded from participation to avoid closely shared 
genetic or immediate environmental confounders. Participants were divided into 
the following groups: (1) Bangladeshi sedentees (n = 107) born and still resident 
in the Sylhet City District, northeast Bangladesh; (2) first-generation migrants 
from Sylhet (n = 75) who moved to the United Kingdom after reaching puberty, 
determined from our data to be > 
19 years (adult migrants); (3) first-generation 
migrants from Sylhet (n = 59) who moved to the United Kingdom before 
completing puberty (aged ≤ 
19 years) (child migrants); (4) second-generation 
British-Bangladeshi men (n = 56) born to parents who had themselves migrated 
to the United Kingdom from Bangladesh; and (5) London residents of British-
European ethnicity (n = 62) recruited from similar neighbourhoods and of similar 
socioeconomic status to the migrant groups.
Migrants were classified as adults if they arrived in the United Kingdom post-
puberty, based on a self-recalled, composite age at puberty (measures detailed 
below). Of 68 migrants who provided age at migration and recalled pubertal age, 
19 reported arriving before, and 49 after puberty. The remaining first-generation 
men were classified as adult migrants if they arrived after the mean composite  
age of puberty + 
2 s.d.: 15.75 + (2 × 2.09) = 19.93, which was rounded to 20 years.  
To ensure that the sedentee population reflected an ethnic and socioeconomic 
group comparable to migrants, with sufficient means to emigrate, participants 
in Sylhet were screened for relatives who had migrated to the United Kingdom, 
mainland Europe or the North American continent, and were recruited using  
local networks and snowballing techniques. Participants in London were  
recruited from community centres, mosques, fitness centres/clubs, or internet  
and newspaper advertisements.
Questionnaires. We collected demographic, migration, reproductive and 
nutritional data, recalled pubertal markers, and health information using previous 
methods employed in a study of Bangladeshi migrant women19,85. Native English 
speakers were given the option of completing a slightly shortened questionnaire 
online via a protected portal.
Saliva sampling. A total of six saliva samples were collected over two non-
consecutive days from each participant. To capture diurnal patterns of hormonal 
profiles that included later analyses of salivary cortisol, one sample was requested 
immediately upon waking, one approximately 30 min post-waking and one 
immediately before retiring to bed. For the purposes of salivary testosterone 
analyses, we only report here the first waking and evening samples. Participants 
were asked to record the exact times of sampling each day; all reported giving 
their first sample within 30 min of waking. Salivary testosterone was measured in 
duplicate by radioimmunoassay without extraction86. Antiserum was prepared, 
and all analyses were performed between 2006 and 2010 in the laboratory of R.T.C. 
at Northwestern University, Chicago, USA. Inter-assay coefficients of variation 
were within 15% for high (100 pg ml–1), low (50 pg ml–1) and internal (pooled saliva 
sample) quality controls, while recovery of spiked samples was 97.1% ± 18.2 s.d. 
Sensitivity was 0.028 nmol l–1 and the average intra-assay coefficient of variation 
was 2.01%. Duplicate readings of two samples were excluded as both exceeded the 
limits of detection of the high standard of the assay, four samples were based on 
single readings due to a limited sample or laboratory error of the second reading. 
Seven outlying samples with z-scores above 3.29 were recoded to + 
2 s.d. of the 
population mean of salivary testosterone for that time point.
Anthropometry. Standing height and weight measurements were collected 
according to standardized methods87. Eight child migrants lacked anthropometric 
data. To preserve sample sizes in analyses of migration effects, testosterone 
regressions within this group only were performed with BMI imputed at the 
population mean and also replicated with complete cases only and with multiple 
imputation methods (see Supplementary Section 2).
Pubertal measures. A composite age at puberty was adapted from the Adolescence 
Scale (AS-ICSM) retrospective self-assessment of puberty milestones44. Age at 
puberty was estimated by averaging when men recalled, where possible, four 
markers of male secondary sexual development: (1) voice breaking; (2) appearance 
of facial hair or start of shaving; (3) first appearance of pubic and underarm hair; 
and (4) first nocturnal emission. Questions were phrased, “Do you remember 
how old you were when… 
?” Participants were asked to respond yes or no, and 
following this, were asked: “If you remember, how old were you?”
. This response 
was open ended, and if the age in years was unknown, respondents were free to 
estimate by other measures such as year of school or other historical events. Men 
responding with estimates spanning two years; for example, “12–13”
, were coded at 
the midpoint, 12.5 years.
Statistical analyses. We tested all hypotheses by multiple linear regression analysis. 
A full description of all variables used and statistical tests performed can be found 
in Supplementary Section 3. All intergroup regressions included age at recruitment 
as a covariate to adjust for cohort differences, potential effects of male reproductive 
ageing45,46, and demographic or secular trends unrelated to our hypotheses. Salivary 
testosterone analyses included BMI as a covariate with an established predictive 
relationship with adult testosterone34,47–49.
To test for evidence that contrasting ecological conditions before puberty relate 
to dependent measures of adult reproductive function, we performed multiple 
linear regressions, with age at recruitment, BMI (in testosterone regressions 
only) and residence group included as covariates. To test for evidence that 
contrasting ecological conditions during early childhood relate to dependent 
measures of adult testosterone, we performed multiple linear regressions with 
covariates being either age at recruitment or number of years spent in the United 
Kingdom since migration, imputed BMI, and two cohorts of child migrants split 
by age of migration before and after reaching nine years of age. As inclusion 
of both age at recruitment and number of years in the United Kingdom in the 
same model exceeded limits of collinearity (variance inflation factor > 
10)88, for 
salivary testosterone, number of years in the United Kingdom was considered a 
combined measure of the influences of exposure to adult and current ecological 
conditions, and the age at recruitment. Results including only complete cases for 
BMI and reanalysis applying multiple imputation techniques are included in the 
Supplementary Materials.
Second-generation men and child migrants exposed to UK conditions from 
before birth to age 8 were combined into a single cohort in a linear regression 
contrasting pubertal recall with cohorts of later childhood (9–19 years at 
migration) or adult migrants (aged > 
19 years at migration). Age of recruitment was 
also included as a control for secular demographic trends in puberty regressions 
where cumulative influences of environment were expected to become fixed at 
adulthood. In addition, we tested for linear relationships between dependent 
variables and age at migration within either the child migrant or adult migrant 
group only, and included age at migration and either age at recruitment or number 
of years in the United Kingdom as covariates additional to BMI or imputed BMI in 
the testosterone regressions. To limit confounding between the effects of ageing/
senescence and exposure to ecological conditions in the United Kingdom in adult 
migrants, we ran the above regressions separately within two age cohorts (≤ 
40 and 
> 
40 at recruitment), split at a conventional point of inflection for male life-course 
studies of sex hormones89.
Post-hoc analysis of the regressions where ‘group’ or ‘cohort’ was an 
independent variable, with Tukey correction of all-pair multiple comparison using 
the R package multicomp tested for evidence for ethnic or developmental cohort 
differences.
To test for differences in age-related trends in salivary testosterone, we ran both 
linear regression and analysis of covariance, including an interaction effect between 
each residence group and age at recruitment on transformed and untransformed 
values. Between-group differences in the slope of age-related declines in 
testosterone were tested in post-hoc analysis, as described above. Within UK-born 
men, we performed an additional regression with measured salivary testosterone 
offset by multiplying the number of years after 22 (an established point of male 
age-related decline46) by the UK-born population trend as the dependent variable, 
and age at recruitment, BMI and ethnic group as covariates. Between-group 
differences in descriptive variables were tested using linear regressions and post-
hoc analysis of differences between residence groups.
Before running the models, salivary testosterone measures were transformed 
by natural logarithm to correct for skewed normality of distribution, and all 
measures were z-transformed to a mean of zero and a standard deviation of 1, except 
calculations for age-related effects on salivary testosterone (Supplementary Table 9), 
which were left untransformed for comparison with published rates of decline. 
All analyses were performed using R statistical software version 3.3.1 (ref. 90) with 
packages detailed in the analysis code provided in Supplementary Section 4.

text, or Methods section).
n/a Confirmed
The exact sample size (n) for each experimental group/condition, given as a discrete number and unit of measurement
An indication of whether measurements were taken from distinct samples or whether the same sample was measured repeatedly
The statistical test(s) used AND whether they are one- or two-sided 
Only common tests should be described solely by name; describe more complex techniques in the Methods section.
A description of all covariates tested
A description of any assumptions or corrections, such as tests of normality and adjustment for multiple comparisons
A full description of the statistics including central tendency (e.g. means) or other basic estimates (e.g. regression coefficient) AND 
variation (e.g. standard deviation) or associated estimates of uncertainty (e.g. confidence intervals)
For null hypothesis testing, the test statistic (e.g. F, t, r) with confidence intervals, effect sizes, degrees of freedom and P value noted 
Give P values as exact values whenever suitable.
For Bayesian analysis, information on the choice of priors and Markov chain Monte Carlo settings
For hierarchical and complex designs, identification of the appropriate level for tests and full reporting of outcomes
Estimates of effect sizes (e.g. Cohen's d, Pearson's r), indicating how they were calculated
Clearly defined error bars 
State explicitly what error bars represent (e.g. SD, SE, CI)
Our web collection on statistics for biologists may be useful.
Software and code

Study description
Quantitative endocrine, anthropometric and questionnaire data
Research sample
All participants were recruited from outwardly healthy, non-clinical populations of adult males (aged 16.5-78 years) resident in London, 
UK or Sylhet, Bangladesh. Men who responded to advertisements or presentations at recruitment sites were screened for diagnosed 
diabetes, thyroid disorder, or use of steroid medication. Sedentees were additionally screened for relatives who migrated to the UK/
Europe/Canada/USA to ensure they represented a family connection to the migrant community. British European men were screened for 
both parents born in Europe.
Sampling strategy
Initial target sample size comprising 70 per group was determined using an a priori power analysis for ANOVA (using G*Power) with a 
specified significance value (α = 0.05), power (1-ß =0.95), and a conventional “medium” effect size (Cohen’s “f” = 0.25). Men were 
recruited through community networks/snowball sampling.
Data collection
Men were interviewed in their native language by trained research assistants or completed questionnaires on their own, depending on 
their literacy and language abilities. Interviews were conducted in semi-private conditions, typically community centres or private homes 
with men given the option to discuss sensitive topics in private. All interviewers and researchers were aware of the men's migration 
status at the time of data collection due to screening requirements. Salivary samples were collected at home by the participants in tubes 
containing sodium azide or methionine preservative and returned by post or collected by researchers. All laboratory analysis was 
performed using laboratory ID numbers, with ordering of analysis randomised and no indication of residence group.
Timing
Data were collected between July 2004 and November 2010 in London, with data collected in Bangladesh in 2005 and 2007.
Data exclusions
Prior to recruitment, participants were screened to exclude thyroid conditions or diabetes. First-order relatives were excluded from 
participation to avoid closely shared genetic or immediate environmental confounders. Participants in Sylhet were screened for relatives 
who had migrated to the UK, mainland Europe, Australia/New Zealand or the North American continent. Salivary data were excluded 
according to pre-determined laboratory protocols: duplicate salivary testosterone readings with coefficient of variation greater than 15% 
were re-analysed or excluded. Of 2018 samples, 39 or 1.9% were excluded for high CV. Duplicate readings of two samples were excluded 
as both exceeded the limits of detection of the high standard of the assay, four samples were based on single readings due to limited 
sample or laboratory error of the second reading. Seven outlying samples with z-scores above 3.29 were recoded to +2 SD of the 
population mean of salivary testosterone for that time point.
Non-participation
Two participants withdrew from the study without specifying the reason and their data and records were excluded from any further 
analysis. All other missing data resulted from failure to complete the study. A total of 68 (18%) of recruited men did not return salivary 
testosterone samples, 32 (9%) did not complete the demographic questionnaire, and 39 (10%) did not provide anthropometric data.
Randomization
Groups were assigned based upon developmental exposure to contrasting ecologies, and therefore were not random. Men were 
allocated into cohorts based on place of birth and age of migration, if applicable. Covariates relevant to our hypotheses were included in 
all statistical analyses.

Antibodies
Antibodies used
Antiserum to testosterone were raised from a rabbit source in the laboratory of coauthor RTC.
Validation
In-house validation studies indicated cross-reaction of 100% with testosterone, 13% with dihydro testosterone, 0.2% with 
androstenedione, and <0.1% with estradiol, androsterone and etiocholanoalone. Antiserum was used at dilution of 1:6000
Human research participants
Policy information about studies involving human research participants
Population characteristics
All men signed informed consent declarations and ethical approval was granted by the UCL Research Ethics Committee (ID: 
0144/002), and the Osmani Medical College in Sylhet. Participants were compensated for their time (£10 in UK, Tk500 in BD) 
upon completion of the study. Data were stored in accordance with the Data Protection Act (UK).
Recruitment
Recruitment was in community centres, religious, sporting, educational and business establishments. While a self-selective group 
may have responded to the advertisements and presentations by participating in and completing the study, recruitment was not 
targeted to a single subpopulation other than members of the Bangladeshi community in the UK or men of European 
background living in neighbouring communities. Migrants in general may represent a self-selective group, however there were 
no indications that men who migrated in adulthood differed from sedentees in the reproductive measures examined here. Age 
differences in migration cohorts are likely representative of demographic results of peak migration patterns as opposed to self-
selection, but demography limits our interpretation of ageing and senescent effects in child and second generation migrants 
over the age of 40 years.
