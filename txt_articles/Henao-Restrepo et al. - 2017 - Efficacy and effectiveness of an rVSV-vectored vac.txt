Summary
Background rVSV-ZEBOV is a recombinant, replication competent vesicular stomatitis virus-based candidate vaccine 
expressing a surface glycoprotein of Zaire Ebolavirus. We tested the eff
 ect of rVSV-ZEBOV in preventing Ebola virus 
disease in contacts and contacts of contacts of recently confi
 rmed cases in Guinea, west Africa.
Methods We did an open-label, cluster-randomised ring vaccination trial (Ebola ça Suffi
  t!) in the communities of 
Conakry and eight surrounding prefectures in the Basse-Guinée region of Guinea, and in Tomkolili and Bombali in 
Sierra Leone. We assessed the effi
  cacy of a single intramuscular dose of rVSV-ZEBOV (2×10⁷ plaque-forming units 
administered in the deltoid muscle) in the prevention of laboratory confi
 rmed Ebola virus disease. After confi
 rmation 
of a case of Ebola virus disease, we defi
 nitively enumerated on a list a ring (cluster) of all their contacts and contacts 
of contacts including named contacts and contacts of contacts who were absent at the time of the trial team visit. The 
list was archived, then we randomly assigned clusters (1:1) to either immediate vaccination or delayed vaccination 
(21 days later) of all eligible individuals (eg, those aged ≥18 years and not pregnant, breastfeeding, or severely ill). An 
independent statistician generated the assignment sequence using block randomisation with randomly varying 
blocks, stratifi
 ed by location (urban vs rural) and size of rings (≤20 individuals vs >20 individuals). Ebola response 
teams and laboratory workers were unaware of assignments. After a recommendation by an independent data and 
safety monitoring board, randomisation was stopped and immediate vaccination was also off
 ered to children aged 
6–17 years and all identifi
 ed rings. The prespecifi
 ed primary outcome was a laboratory confi
 rmed case of Ebola virus 
disease with onset 10 days or more from randomisation. The primary analysis compared the incidence of Ebola virus 
disease in eligible and vaccinated individuals assigned to immediate vaccination versus eligible contacts and contacts 
of contacts assigned to delayed vaccination. This trial is registered with the Pan African Clinical Trials Registry, 
number PACTR201503001057193.
Findings In the randomised part of the trial we identifi
 ed 4539 contacts and contacts of contacts in 51 clusters 
randomly assigned to immediate vaccination (of whom 3232 were eligible, 2151 consented, and 2119 were 
immediately vaccinated) and 4557 contacts and contacts of contacts in 47 clusters randomly assigned to delayed 
vaccination (of whom 3096 were eligible, 2539 consented, and 2041 were vaccinated 21 days after randomisation). 
No cases of Ebola virus disease occurred 10 days or more after randomisation among randomly assigned contacts 
and contacts of contacts vaccinated in immediate clusters versus 16 cases (7 clusters aff
 ected) among all eligible 
individuals in delayed clusters. Vaccine effi
  cacy was 100% (95% CI 68·9–100·0, p=0·0045), and the calculated 
intraclass correlation coeffi
  cient was 0·035. Additionally, we defi
 ned 19 non-randomised clusters in which we 
enumerated 2745 contacts and contacts of contacts, 2006 of whom were eligible and 1677 were immediately 
vaccinated, including 194 children. The evidence from all 117 clusters showed that no cases of Ebola virus disease 
occurred 10 days or more after randomisation among all immediately vaccinated contacts and contacts of contacts 
versus 23 cases (11 clusters aff
 ected) among all eligible contacts and contacts of contacts in delayed plus all eligible 
contacts and contacts of contacts never vaccinated in immediate clusters. The estimated vaccine effi
  cacy here was 
100% (95% CI 79·3–100·0, p=0·0033). 52% of contacts and contacts of contacts assigned to immediate vaccination 
and in non-randomised clusters received the vaccine immediately; vaccination protected both vaccinated and 
unvaccinated people in those clusters. 5837 individuals in total received the vaccine (5643 adults and 194 children), 
and all vaccinees were followed up for 84 days. 3149 (53·9%) of 5837 individuals reported at least one adverse event 
in the 14 days after vaccination; these were typically mild (87·5% of all 7211 adverse events). Headache (1832 
[25·4%]), fatigue (1361 [18·9%]), and muscle pain (942 [13·1%]) were the most commonly reported adverse events 
in this period across all age groups. 80 serious adverse events were identifi
 ed, of which two were judged to be

Introduction
Since the Ebola virus was fi
 rst identifi
 ed in 1976, sporadic 
outbreaks of Ebola virus disease have been reported in 
Africa, each causing high mortality.1 No vaccine is 
currently licensed for preventing Ebola virus disease or 
other fi
 lovirus infections. The 2013–16 outbreak of Ebola 
virus disease in west Africa2 highlighted the need to 
produce and assess a safe and eff
 ective Ebola vaccine for 
human beings.3 One promising vaccine candidate,4 the 
recombinant, replication-competent, vesicular stomatitis 
virus-based vaccine expressing the glycoprotein of a Zaire 
Ebolavirus (rVSV-ZEBOV), is protective in challenge 
models in several animal species,5–16 including mice, 
hamsters, guinea pigs, and non-human primates.4,5  A 
single dose completely protected non-human primates 
against high-dose challenge (around 1000 particle-
forming units) when administered between 7 and 31 days 
pre-challenge7–9 and partly protected non-human primates 
when administered from 3 days before7 to 24 h after 
challenge with the Makona strain responsible for the west 
African epidemic.11
We therefore undertook Ebola ça Suffi
  t! (translated as 
“Ebola that’s enough!”), a ring vaccination phase 3 
effi
  cacy trial in Guinea whose primary objective was to 
assess the effi
  cacy of the rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine for the 
prevention of Ebola virus disease in human beings (the 
ring vaccination approach was inspired by the 
surveillance-containment strategy that led to smallpox 
eradication).17 Preliminary results indicated 100% vaccine 
effi
  cacy (95% CI 74·7–100·0) at interim analysis, after 
which the delayed-vaccination arm was discontinued.18 
Here, we present the fi
 nal results of the trial.
Research in context
Evidence before this study
There are currently no licensed vaccines for preventing Ebola 
virus disease or other fi
 lovirus infections. The rVSV-ZEBOV 
candidate vaccine has been reported to be protective in 
challenge models in several non-human species. We searched 
Medline and EMBASE without language restrictions for articles 
published from January, 1990, to July 20, 2015, to identify any 
published phase 3 clinical trials assessing the effi
  cacy of Ebola 
vaccines, using the search terms “Ebola virus”, “fi
 lovirus”, 
“prophylaxis”, “vaccine”, and “clinical trials”. The rVSV-ZEBOV 
vaccine has been studied in phase 1 and phase 2 studies, which 
have documented its immunogenicity and safety profi
 le. To our 
knowledge, ours is the only phase 3 trial of this vaccine in west 
Africa that has reported results, and no trial until now has used 
the ring vaccination cluster-randomised design. Therefore, we 
could not do a detailed systematic review at this point in time.
Added value of this study
Ebola Ça Suffi
  t used a novel trial design based on identifi
 cation 
of people at risk around a newly confi
 rmed case of Ebola virus 
disease (contacts and contacts of contacts) and ring vaccination 
to improve the prospect of generating robust evidence on the 
eff
 ects of the vaccine despite the low and decreasing incidence 
of Ebola virus disease. Individuals were either randomly 
assigned to immediate vaccination or delayed vaccination, or 
not randomly assigned (and received immediate vaccination). 
Interim analysis suggested that rVSV-ZEBOV off
 ered very high 
protection, leading to the delayed-vaccination arm being 
discontinued. Final data from all trial clusters (randomised and 
non-randomised, with children included in the 
non-randomised group) showed that at 10 days or more after 
randomisation, there were no cases of Ebola virus disease 
among immediately vaccinated contacts and contacts of 
contacts; ie, 100% protection. Adverse events data indicated no 
safety concerns in adults or children.
Implications of all the available evidence
We used a novel trial design, which had a high probability of 
generating evidence on the individual and cluster-level eff
 ects of 
the vaccine despite the low and decreasing incidence of Ebola 
virus disease. These results indicate that rVSV-ZEBOV is safe and 
eff
 ective in averting Ebola virus disease when added to 
established control measures as a ring vaccination approach. 
Ring vaccination trials might have application in the assessment 
of other vaccine candidates in epidemics of other viral 
haemorrhagic fevers or other emerging infectious diseases.

Methods
Study design and participants
The Guinea ring vaccination trial was a cluster-
randomised controlled trial designed to assess the eff
 ect 
of one dose of the candidate vaccine in protecting against 
laboratory confi
 rmed Ebola virus disease. We did this 
trial in the community in Conakry and eight surrounding 
prefectures in the Basse-Guinée region of Guinea 
(appendix).
The Guinean national medicines regulatory agency 
(Direction Nationale de la Pharmacie et du Laboratoire) 
and the national ethics committee (Comité National 
d’Ethique pour la Recherche en Santé), the WHO 
Ethical Research Committee, and Norwegian Regional 
Committees for Medical and Health Research Ethics 
approved the study protocol. In Aug, 2015, after approval 
by Sierra Leonean National Regulatory Authority and the 
Ethics Review Committee, the trial was extended to 
Sierra Leone (Tomkolili and Bombali).
Ebola virus spread across many geographical areas of 
Guinea, mainly through familial and social networks and 
funeral exposures.19 After confi
 rmation of a case of Ebola 
virus disease (index case), we enumerated and 
randomised clusters (called rings) of epidemiologically 
linked people.20 The ring vaccination design ensured that 
the study was undertaken in pockets of high incidence of 
Ebola virus disease despite the declining epidemic and 
an overall low attack rate (ie, the total number of cases of 
Ebola virus disease in the three worst aff
 ected countries 
divided by the estimated total population of these 
countries; estimated here as about 0·13%). Details of the 
study 
protocol, 
study 
team 
composition, 
study 
procedures, and statistical analysis plan have been 
previously reported.18,20
Briefl
 y, we enumerated clusters as a list of all contacts 
and contacts of contacts of the index case including 
residents temporarily absent at the time of enumeration. 
We defi
 ned contacts as individuals who lived in the same 
household, visited or were visited by the index case after 
the onset of symptoms, provided him or her with 
unprotected care, or prepared the body for the traditional 
funeral ceremony. These contacts included high-risk 
contacts who were in close physical contact with the 
patient’s body or body fl
 uids, linen, or clothes.21 Contacts 
of contacts were the neighbours of the index case to the 
nearest appropriate geographical boundary plus the 
household members of any high-risk contacts living 
away from the index cases’ residence. A new cluster was 
defi
 ned if at least 60% of the contacts and contacts of 
contacts were not enumerated in a previous cluster.
We randomly assigned clusters into immediate 
vaccination or vaccination delayed by 21 days. Exclusion 
criteria were: history of Ebola virus disease (self-declared 
or laboratory confi
 rmed), being aged less than 18 years, 
pregnancy (verbally declared) or breastfeeding (women 
were invited, but not forced, to take a pregnancy test), 
 
history 
of 
administration 
of 
other 
experimental 
treatments during the past 28 days, history of anaphylaxis 
to a vaccine or  vaccine component, or serious disease 
requiring confi
 ning to bed or admission to hospital by 
the time of vaccination.  Within each cluster, all people 
who were eligible and consented were off
 ered vaccination.
A team obtained written informed consent from all 
eligible contacts and contacts of contacts using a printed 
information sheet. If the person in question was illiterate, 
these documents were read to him or her in their local 
language and a fi
 ngerprint from the participant and the 
signature of an independent literate witness documented 
consent. Eligible contacts and contacts of contacts were 
informed of the outcome of the randomisation at the end 
of the informed consent process. 
The trial personnel were predominantly composed of 
nationals from Guinea and other African countries. An 
internal quality assurance and quality control system was 
put in place, with 100% monitoring of study documents. 
An 
independent 
data 
and 
safety 
monitoring 
board (DSMB) reviewed the study protocol and the 
analysis plan before the analysis and assessed adverse 
events and effi
  cacy results. The pilot phase of the trial 
began on March 23, 2015, and random assignment of 
clusters started on April 1, 2015. On July 31, 2015, random 
assignment into immediate and delayed vaccination was 
discontinued on the recommendation of the DSMB, 
whose decision took into consideration the interim 
analysis showing 100% vaccine effi
  cacy18 (although they 
noted that the prespecifi
 ed α spending criterion of 0·0027 
was not achieved) and the low probability of being able to 
recruit substantial numbers of additional rings (given 
the declining number of cases of Ebola virus disease in 
the country). Thereafter, all identifi
 ed rings received 
immediate vaccination. Ring enrolment was concluded 
on Jan 20, 2016.
Additionally, in view of emerging data for vaccine 
safety among children aged 6–17 years,22 the protocol was 
amended on Aug 15, 2015, to also include children in this 
age group. Consequently, we obtained written informed 
consent from the parents or guardians of children aged 
6–17 years with written assent from children aged 
12–17 years.
Randomisation and masking
Contacts and contacts of contacts of individuals with Ebola 
virus disease were enumerated into clusters (and the 
information stored on a list) and these clusters were 
cluster-randomised (1:1) to either immediate vaccination 
or delayed vaccination (21 days later) of all eligible 
individuals.20 The teams who defi
 ned the clusters were 
diff
 erent from the team who took informed consent or did 
the vaccinations. Randomisation took place only after the 
list enumerating all the contacts and contacts of contacts 
of a cluster was closed. An independent statistician not 
otherwise involved in the trial generated the allocation 
sequence, and Ebola response teams and laboratory 
workers were unaware of the allocation of clusters.

We used block randomisation randomly varying block 
sizes, stratifi
 ed by location (urban vs rural) and size of 
rings (≤20 vs >20 individuals). The randomisation list 
was stored in a data management system not accessible 
to anyone involved in the recruitment of trial 
participants. Allocation of a cluster was done once the 
enumeration of the cluster (ie, the list of contacts and 
contacts of contacts) was done. Allocation of the cluster 
was informed to the participants at the end of the 
informed consent process. In the pilot phase and after 
July 27, 2015, clusters were not randomised and all 
eligible participants received the vaccine immediately 
after informed consent.
Procedures
Active surveillance for, and laboratory confi
 rmation of, 
cases of Ebola virus disease were independently 
undertaken by the national surveillance system, and 
cases of Ebola virus disease were confi
 rmed by designated 
surveillance 
laboratories.23,24 
The 
national 
Ebola 
surveillance team and the trial team were independent; 
the trial team did not communicate any specifi
 c 
information to the surveillance teams and laboratories 
about which cases of Ebola virus disease were used to 
form a new cluster or which people would be included in 
a cluster.
Within 1–2 days of confi
 rmation of a new case of 
Ebola virus disease, our social communication teams 
visited the area of residence of the case and sought the 
communities’ consent for the trial team to enumerate a 
new cluster. A second team enumerated the cluster list 
of contacts and contacts of contacts. This list was then 
stored. From the complete cluster list, preliminary 
inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied (eg, age) 
to generate a list of all potential trial participants 
(eligible contacts and contacts of contacts) to be 
approached for consent. Eligible contacts and contacts 
of 
contacts 
cluster-randomised 
to 
immediate 
vaccination had only one opportunity to give their 
informed consent; ie, during the fi
 rst contact (day 0). 
Eligible contacts and contacts of contacts assigned to 
delayed clusters had two opportunities to consent: 
day 0 and day 21 when vaccination was off
 ered to 
the cluster.
The rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine (Merck Sharp & Dohme, 
Kenilworth, NJ, USA) was selected for the trial according 
to a framework developed by an independent group of 
experts.25 All vaccinees received one dose of 2 × 10⁷ plaque-
forming units of the rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine intra-
muscularly in the deltoid muscle.
To assess safety, vaccinees were observed for 30 min 
post-vaccination and at home visits on days 3, 14, 21, 42, 
63, and 84. The possible causal relationship of any 
adverse event to vaccination was judged by the study 
physicians and reported to the DSMB. Vaccinees were 
provided with acetaminophen or ibuprofen for the 
management or prevention of post-vaccination fever.
Outcomes
The primary outcome was a laboratory confi
 rmed case of 
Ebola virus disease, defi
 ned as any probable or suspected 
case from whom a blood sample was taken and laboratory 
confi
 rmed as positive for Ebola virus; or any deceased 
individual with probable Ebola virus disease, from whom 
a post-mortem sample taken within 48 h after death was 
laboratory confi
 rmed as positive for Ebola virus 
disease.23,24 In our secondary objectives, we analysed the 
vaccine eff
 ect on deaths due to Ebola virus disease. A 
prespecifi
 ed secondary analysis examined the overall 
ring vaccination eff
 ectiveness in protecting all contacts 
and contacts of contacts in the randomised clusters 
(including unvaccinated cluster members) although the 
trial was not powered to measure population level eff
 ects. 
Local laboratories of the Ebola surveillance system 
confi
 rmed cases by either detection of virus RNA by 
reverse transcriptase-PCR or detection of IgM antibodies 
directed against Ebola virus.23,24 If available to us, aliquots 
of samples were retested at the European Mobile 
Laboratory using the RealStar Zaire Ebolavirus reverse 
transcriptase-PCR kit 1.0. All index cases and secondary 
cases of Ebola virus disease occurring in the clusters 
were documented using laboratory results, case 
investigation forms and information on chains of 
transmission developed independently by the national 
surveillance team and, if needed, supplemented with 
information collected by trial personnel.
A priori, we defi
 ned that only cases of Ebola virus 
disease with an onset 10 or more days from randomisation 
were valid outcomes for the trial.18,20 This was done to 
account for the incubation period of Ebola virus 
disease,26,27 the time between onset of symptoms and 
laboratory confi
 rmation and the unknown period between 
vaccination and a vaccine-induced protective immune 
response (lag period).20 Additionally, vaccinated cases of 
Ebola virus disease with an onset of more than 31 days 
after random assignment were censored to account for 
vaccination in the delayed clusters on day 21.18,20
Statistical analysis
The sample size calculation is described elsewhere.18,20 
We analysed outcomes at the cluster level rather than 
individual level using the cumulative incidence of valid 
outcomes for each cluster. Additional to the planned 
analyses,20 and to address external suggestions on our 
interim analysis report28–30 we did further analyses of the 
randomised data. For the randomised evidence, we 
compared the incidence of Ebola virus disease in: 1) all 
vaccinated in immediate versus all contacts and contacts 
of contacts eligible and who consented on day 0 visit in 
delayed; 2) all vaccinated in immediate versus all contacts 
and contacts of contacts eligible in delayed; 3) all contacts 
and contacts of contacts eligible in immediate versus all 
contacts and contacts of contacts eligible in delayed; 
and 4) all contacts and contacts of contacts in immediate 
versus all contacts and contacts of contacts in delayed.

We also analysed the evidence from all clusters, including 
data from randomised and non-randomised clusters. For all 
clusters, we compared the incidence of Ebola virus disease 
in: all vaccinated in immediate versus all contacts and 
contacts of contacts who were eligible in delayed plus all 
contacts and contacts of contacts who were eligible but never 
vaccinated in immediate; all contacts and contacts of contacts 
in immediate versus all contacts and contacts of contacts in 
delayed and; all vaccinated in immediate versus all eligible 
but never vaccinated in immediate. Additionally, we 
characterised the risk of Ebola exposure and participant 
characteristics for all the groups being compared.

Similar to the interim analysis, if no cases of Ebola virus 
disease occurred in one group, we derived a 95% CI for the 
vaccine eff
 ect by fi
 tting a β-binomial distribution to the 
cluster-level numerators and denominators and used an 
inverted likelihood ratio test to identify the lower bound for 
vaccine eff
 ect. For comparisons in which cases of Ebola 
virus disease occurred in both groups, we fi
 tted a Cox 
proportional hazards model using a cluster-level frailty term 
to adjust for clustering within rings.18 We used Fisher’s exact 
test to compare the proportions of clusters with at least one 
event across the two trial groups. The primary analysis was 
per protocol. We did all analyses in R, version 3.3.1.31 
We received comments on the protocol and statistical 
analysis plan from an independent scientifi
 c advisory 
group. Independent clinical monitors validated 100% of the 
case report forms and an independent auditor assessed the 
study site, fi
 eld activities, and supporting documentation. 
This trial is registered with the Pan African Clinical Trials 
Registry, number PACTR201503001057193.

Results
During the trial period between March 23, 2015, and 
Jan 20, 2016, there were 476 cases of Ebola virus disease 
in Guinea, all in the study area. 117 were index cases for 
clusters, 27 were index cases and also endpoints. In total, 
105 were endpoints (75 among the eligible contacts and 
contacts of contacts and 30 among non-eligible contacts 
and contacts of contacts). We did not defi
 ne a cluster 
around 281 (59%) of the cases of Ebola virus disease 
occurring during this period. These 281 cases of Ebola 
virus disease mostly arose during March and April, 2015, 
during the pilot phase and when most study teams were 
still being trained and the study did not have full capacity 
(fi
 gure 1; appendix).
In all, we obtained aliquots from 79% (93/117) Ebola 
virus disease index cases; 88% (30/34) of confi
 rmed 
Ebola virus disease outcome cases with onset 10 or more 
days after randomisation and 80% (57/71) of all confi
 rmed 
Ebola virus disease outcome cases. 5837 individuals in 
total received the vaccine (5643 adults and 194 children); 
all were followed up for 84 days.
The measured characteristics of index cases of Ebola 
virus disease and clusters were broadly comparable at 
baseline for immediate, delayed, and non-randomised 
clusters, including time from onset to randomisation 
and the proportion of index cases who were dead at the 
time of randomisation (table 1). Mean time from 
symptom onset in index cases to ring inclusion was 
9·8 days in immediate rings, 10·9 days in delayed rings, 
and 7·3 days in non-randomised rings. Randomised 
clusters had a median 80 people (IQR 64–101) for 
immediate and a median 81 people (69–118) for delayed 
clusters. Non-randomised clusters were slightly larger 
with a median 105 people (49–185), partly due to public 
knowledge of the interim results as well as to the 
eligibility extension to children aged 6 years and older.
At baseline, the characteristics of contacts and contacts 
of contacts in all comparator groups for immediate, 
delayed and non-randomised clusters were largely 
comparable (table 2; appendix). A higher fraction of high-
risk contacts was included in the immediate clusters. 
More than 80% of contacts and contacts of contacts were 
defi
 ned as contacts of contacts. Compliance with 
follow-up visits on all types of clusters and for all 
scheduled visits was more than 80% with no diff
 erences 
between groups (appendix).
In the randomised part of the trial, there were 
4539 contacts and contacts of contacts in 51 clusters in 
the immediate vaccination arm (of whom 3232 were 
eligible, 2151 consented, and 2119 were immediately 
vaccinated) and 4557 contacts and contacts of contacts in 
47 clusters in the delayed vaccination arm (of whom 
3096 were eligible, 2539 consented and 2041 were 
vaccinated 21 days after randomisation; fi
 gure 1). In 
immediate 
clusters, 
34% 
(1113/3232) 
of 
eligible 
individuals were not vaccinated mainly because informed 
consent was not obtained (n=728) or it was withdrawn 
(n=32), or because individuals were absent at the time of 
the team’s visit (n=353; fi
 gure 1, tables 1, 2; appendix).In 
delayed  clusters, 34% (1055/3096) of eligible individuals

were not vaccinated mainly because informed consent 
was not obtained or it was withdrawn (n=788) or because 
individuals were absent at the time of the team’s visit 
(n=252) or developed Ebola virus disease during the 
0–20 days period (n=12; fi
 gure 1, tables 1, 2; appendix). 
Additionally, two individuals were pregnant, and one was 
severely ill, so these were not vaccinated. Among those 
who consented in the delayed clusters, 57% (1435/2539) 
gave their consent during the fi
 rst visit with the study 
team (day 0) and 43% (1104/2539) gave consent on the 
vaccination visit (day 21); all were included in the cluster 
enumeration list.
Random assignment had little eff
 ect on the onset of 
Ebola virus disease during days 0–9. 20 cases of Ebola 
virus disease occurred among 3232 eligible contacts and 
contacts of contacts (nine clusters aff
 ected) in 
51 immediate clusters versus 21 cases among 3096 
eligible contacts and contacts of contacts (14 clusters 
aff
 ected) in 47 delayed clusters (table 3; appendix). 
However, vaccine allocation reduced Ebola virus disease 
onset to 0 cases from 10 days post-randomisation in 
immediately vaccinated contacts and contacts of contacts 
versus ten cases of Ebola virus disease (four clusters 
aff
 ected) among the eligible contacts and contacts of 
contacts in delayed clusters who gave consent on day 0. 
Vaccine effi
  cacy was still 100% (table 3). The calculated 
intraclass coeffi
  cient (ICC) was high at 0·14, largely due 
to clustering of six confi
 rmed endpoint cases of Ebola 
virus disease in one of the clusters. This would make the 
Fisher’s test even more conservative. This ICC value 
contrasts with the ICC value of 0·0520 that we used to 
estimate the trial sample size and power calculation 
(appendix).
One additional case of Ebola virus disease was 
identifi
 ed in the delayed clusters among eligible contacts 
and contacts of contacts who consented on day 21 for a 
total of 11 cases of Ebola virus disease among eligible and 
consenting contacts and contacts of contacts in delayed 
clusters. The remaining ten cases in the delayed clusters 
were among the eligible contacts and contacts of contacts 
who consented on day 0. Among these 11 cases of Ebola 
virus disease, including four vaccinees (onset 0, 2, 6, and 
6 days after vaccination), seven (64%) were among 
unvaccinated contacts (one high-risk contact) and the 
four others were contacts of contacts (appendix).
The overall ring vaccination eff
 ectiveness in protecting all 
contacts and contacts of contacts in the randomised clusters 
(including unvaccinated cluster members) was 64·6% 
(table 3), with 65·6% of the eligible contacts and contacts of 
contacts receiving the vaccine at the cluster level.
No cases of Ebola virus disease occurred 10 days or 
more after randomisation among randomly assigned 
contacts and contacts of contacts vaccinated in immediate 
clusters versus 16 cases (7 clusters aff
 ected) among all 
eligible individuals in delayed clusters (table 3). Vaccine 
effi
  cacy was 100% (95% CI 68·9–100·0, p=0·0045), and 
the calculated ICC was 0·035. Additionally, we

enumerated 2745 contacts and contacts of contacts (three 
in the pilot phase) in 19 non-randomised clusters, 2006 
of whom were eligible and 1677 were immediately 
vaccinated, including 194 children aged 6–17 years 
(fi
 gure 1).
The evidence from all 117 clusters (randomised and 
non-randomised) showed that no cases of Ebola virus 
disease occurred 10 days or more after randomisation 
among the 3775 immediately vaccinated contacts and 
contacts of contacts versus 23 cases (11 clusters aff
 ected) 
among the 4507 eligible contacts and contacts of contacts 
in delayed plus all eligible contacts and contacts of 
contacts never vaccinated in immediate clusters (tables 3, 
4; appendix). Of these 23 cases of Ebola virus disease, 
four were vaccinated but had onset of Ebola virus disease 
at days 0, 2, 6, and 6 after vaccination and the remaining 
19 cases were among non-vaccinated contacts and 
contacts of contacts. Thus, immediate vaccination 
resulted in complete protection against subsequent onset 
of Ebola virus disease 10 days later or more. The 
estimated vaccine effi
  cacy here was 100% (95% CI 
79·3–100·0, p=0·0033; table 4). 52% of contacts and 
contacts of contacts assigned to immediate vaccination 
and in non-randomised clusters received the vaccine 
immediately; vaccination protected both vaccinated and 
unvaccinated people in those clusters. 
Cases occurred in the fi
 rst 10 days after randomisation 
for all comparison groups, at similar times; there were 
no cases of Ebola virus disease among vaccinees from 
10 days after randomisation or vaccination in any of the 
groups, with all cases arising in clusters more than 
10 days post-vaccination occurring in unvaccinated 
individuals (fi
 gure 2). Additionally, the rVSV-ZEBOV 
vaccine seemed to have contributed to interrupt Ebola 
transmission in the clusters because no cases of Ebola 
virus 
disease 
among 
vaccinees 
or 
unvaccinated 
individuals were observed in immediate vaccinated 
clusters after 21 days after vaccination (fi
 gure 2). Details 
about the distribution of cases of Ebola virus disease 
among the various groups are in table 4 and the appendix.
Because no cases of Ebola virus disease occurred at 
10 days or later in the vaccinated group, the vaccine 
eff
 ect was high for all the comparisons of vaccine eff
 ect 
on deaths due to Ebola virus disease (appendix), with 
100% eff
 ect (95% CI 62·6–100, p=0·0102) when 
comparing all vaccinated in immediate clusters versus

all eligible in delayed clusters. 
 
 
 
 We were not able to do the 
planned secondary analyses on vaccine eff
 ect against 
probable and suspected cases because of near-
universality of laboratory testing of such cases in Guinea 
during the study period, leaving only 26/502 (5%) of 
cases without a defi
 nitive diagnosis. Five cases of Ebola 
virus disease initially considered as index cases for 
clusters were negative by confi
 rmatory retesting and the 
corresponding clusters were therefore excluded from the 
analysis. No endpoint cases tested negative on 
confi
 rmatory retesting.
In total, we identifi
 ed 105 cases of Ebola virus disease 
among all contacts and contacts of contacts (eligible or 
not for vaccination) in the 117 clusters defi
 ned 
(98 randomised clusters and 19 non-randomised clusters). 
The overall attack rate was 0·9% (95% CI 0·7–1·1) 
considering 
the 
105 
cases 
occurring 
among 
11 841 individuals enumerated in 117 rings. None of the 
cases occurred in vaccinated individuals 10 days or more 
after being vaccinated (fi
 gure 3; appendix).
Moreover, when comparing all contacts and contacts of 
contacts in clusters immediately vaccinated versus all 
contacts and contacts of contacts in delayed clusters plus all 
contacts and contacts of contacts never vaccinated in 
immediate or non-randomised clusters, vaccine protection 
was 100% (table 3) further indicating that the vaccine is 
highly protective (table 4; appendix). This represents the 
totality of evidence for high vaccine effi
  cacy when 
comparing all immediately vaccinated people to all delayed 
or unvaccinated people. The overall ring vaccination 
eff
 ectiveness in protecting all contacts and contacts of 
contacts (including vaccinated and unvaccinated cluster 
members) was 70·1% (table 3) with 52·1% (3796/7284) of 
the contacts and contacts of contacts vaccinated.
Cases occurred in the fi
 rst 10 days at a similar time in 
immediate, delayed, and non-randomised clusters and 
all comparison groups. There were no cases of Ebola 
virus disease among vaccinees from 10 days post-
vaccination in any of the groups (fi
 gure 3, appendix). 
 
 
Moreover, rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine contributed to interrupt 
Ebola transmission with no cases of Ebola virus disease 
after 32 days after randomisation in randomly assigned 
and non-randomly assigned clusters in vaccinated and 
non-vaccinated individuals (fi
 gure 2, 3).
3149 (53·9%) of 5837 individuals reported at least one 
adverse event in the 14 days after vaccination (appendix); 
across all adverse events, solicited and unsolicited, 
87·5% (6311/7211) were mild, 11·0% (793/7211) moderate, 
 
and 1·2% (83/7211) severe (appendix). Across all age 
groups, headache (1832 [25·4%]), fatigue (1361 [18·9%]),

and muscle pain (942 [13·1%) were the most commonly 
reported adverse events in this period across all age 
groups. Data from children indicated that in the 3 days 
after vaccination, by percentage of individuals with the 
events, the commonly reported adverse events were 
headache (51/97 [52·6%]), fatigue (11/97 [11·3%]), and 
injection pain (9/97 [9·3%]). Adults most commonly 
reported headache (1781/7114 [25·0%]), fatigue (1350/7114 
[19·0%]), and muscle pain (937/7114 [13·2%]) in the same 
period. Arthralgia was the fourth most reported adverse 
event (table 5; reported by 17·9% of vaccinated 
participants), and was reported in 4/180 (2·2%) of 
vaccinated children with a mean duration of 4·5 days 
(IQR 3–5) and in 915/4960 (18·5%) of vaccinated adults 
with a mean duration of 2 days (2–4). Cases resolved 
spontaneousl 
y without sequelae.
80 serious adverse events were reported. The 
most common diagnosis was Ebola virus disease in 
39/80 participants (48·7%) followed by road traffi
  c 
accident injury in 4/80 (5%; appendix). Two serious 
adverse events were judged to be related to vaccination (a 
febrile reaction and one anaphylaxis, which resolved 
without sequelae) and one possibly related (infl
 uenza-
like illness) which also recovered without sequelae. 
15 serious adverse events occurred among enrolled but 
non-vaccinated participants; 14 were Ebola virus disease 
in participants (all with onset 0–10 days after 
randomisation) and one was a road traffi
  c accident injury.
Discussion
The results presented in this fi
 nal analysis of our Ebola ça 
Suffi
  t trial strengthen the interim estimates and 
conclusions18 that the rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine has high 
protective effi
  cacy and eff
 ectiveness to prevent Ebola virus 
disease. The current report included data from 
27 additional clusters; eight of which were randomly 
assigned to immediate or delayed vaccination. No 
vaccinees developed Ebola virus disease 10 days or more 
after randomisation, but cases occurred in unvaccinated 
comparators, both in randomised and non-randomised 
clusters. When we compared randomly assigned contacts 
and contacts of contacts vaccinated in immediate clusters 
(day 0) versus all eligible in delayed clusters, vaccine 
effi
  cacy was 100%. These fi
 nal analyses hence support the 
interim report effi
  cacy results, indicating that ring 
vaccination with an eff
 ective vaccine can contribute as a 
control strategy for future outbreaks of Ebola virus disease.
Data from early phase 1–2 studies suggest that 
rVSV-ZEBOV is well tolerated in human beings and 
produces a rapid immune response after a single dose,32,33

with its short-term protection most likely mediated by 
innate immunity. One explanation for this fi
 nding is that 
innate immune activation by the vaccine might provide a 
window of protection that restricts virus replication in 
the essential period needed for the development of 
specifi
 c adaptive responses.11
A devastating outbreak of Ebola virus disease is clearly 
not the ideal situation for doing a vaccine trial. The health-
care system in Guinea was strained, potential trial 
participants were worried about a candidate vaccine made 
by foreign people, and the Ebola virus disease response 
teams were facing security issues. Therefore, we made a 
deliberate decision to tailor the logistical implementation 
of the trial to local conditions.20 The close collaboration 
with, and the support from, the Guinean National 
Authorities was a catalysing factor in the successful 
implementation of the trial. In addition, we made eff
 orts 
to ensure full ownership and understanding by national 
authorities and communities through active community 
engagement and individual consent. Despite the 
challenges, our team was able to do the trial in compliance 
with good clinical practice and international standards.
We addressed common biases of cluster-randomised 
trials. Our analyses suggested no imbalances in the 
demographic characteristics of the index cases or the risk 
factors for Ebola virus disease infection documented in 
the contacts and contacts of contacts, further supporting 
the hypothesis that any diff
 erences were due to a vaccine 
eff
 ect. A few diff
 erences remained between groups. Time 
to cluster defi
 nition was slightly shorter in the immediate 
vaccination group, which also had more high-risk 
contacts reported. All valid clusters enrolled were 
analysed, and more than 90% of vaccinees were followed 
up in all groups. To address recruitment bias, we fi
 nalised 
and closed the enumeration of eligible contacts and 
contacts of contacts in each cluster before cluster 
allocation. Although we implemented prospective 
recruitment, only contacts and contacts of contacts 
included in the cluster enumeration list were given the 
opportunity to provide informed consent. A diff
 erent 
team obtained informed consent to minimise subversion. 
Participants were informed of the outcome of 
randomisation at the end of the informed consent 
process, and both immediate and delayed clusters were 
given identical information about the trial before 
consent.
The inclusion of temporarily absent contacts and 
contacts of contacts contributed to a moderate

gave consent during the fi
 rst visit (day 0). Because only 
one additional case of Ebola virus disease was 
documented among those consenting late (on day 21), 
the estimated vaccine eff
 ect remained 100% but the lower 
95% CI bound changed from 68·9% to 63·5%.
These results are the only effi
  cacy data available for 
rVSV-ZEBOV, and for any Ebola virus disease vaccine, 
available from trials in human beings to date. Because of 
the challenges of implementing the trial, we decided not 
to attempt to collect biological samples from vaccinees for 
immunological analysis and therefore an individual-level 
correlation of protection analysis was unfortunately not 
possible. Such interpretation would also have been 
rendered diffi
  cult given that there were no break-through 
cases among vaccinees after day 10. The high levels of 
vaccine eff
 ect noted in this study are in line with fi
 ndings 
from other studies, such as the phase 2 PREVAIL trial,34 
which used the same dose and route of administration 
and showed that 94% of 500 individuals who received the 
rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine seroconverted after a month. 
Results from animal studies with rVSV-ZEBOV vaccines 
have also shown consistently high and rapid protection.11,12 
Our results will be further complemented by those from a 
cohort study to assess immune response after vaccination 
that we did in front-line workers in Guinea.
We designed this trial to have a high probability of 
generating meaningful data for the effi
  cacy of the vaccine 
despite the low and declining incidence of Ebola virus 
disease. Our design attempted to address the challenge 
that the comparator group should not be denied access 
(at least indefi
 nitely) to the experimental vaccine, an 
issue raised by ethics committees and others, and we 
opened eligibility for children as soon as preliminary 
safety data were available from phase 1 studies.22  In our 
fi
 nal phase 3 analyses no serious safety signals were 
identifi
 ed in children or adults. 
A feature of the ring vaccination trial design is the 
potential to measure indirect protection within the 
clusters. Our data suggest that such indirect eff
 ect 
occurred, but the small sample size prevented a defi
 nitive 
conclusion. Nevertheless, the high effi
  cacy of the 
rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine, as indicated by the randomised 
and non-randomised analysis, suggests that the Ebola ça 
Suffi
  t trial itself had some contribution to foreshortening 
the epidemic of Ebola virus disease in west Africa by 
direct and indirect aversion of cases. The evidence from 
randomised and non-randomised clusters and the fact 
no cases of Ebola virus disease occurred 10 or more days 
after vaccination (through the 84 days follow-up period 
and from the indefi
 nite surveillance system throughout 
the epidemic period) indicates substantial protection of 
rVSV-ZEBOV 
against 
Ebola 
virus 
disease. 
Ring 
vaccination was eff
 ective in contributing to controlling 
the Ebola virus disease outbreak. Results from 
mathematical modelling studies, which used the data 
from the ring vaccination trial, indicate that using ring 
vaccination within a surveillance and containment 
within-cluster percentage of vaccinees among the 
eligible contacts and contacts of contacts of 65·6% in 
immediately randomised clusters, 65·9% in delayed 
randomised clusters and 83·6% in non-randomised 
clusters. The higher uptake of vaccine among the 
contacts and contacts of contacts in non-randomised 
clusters might be attributable to public knowledge of the 
interim results as well as the inclusion of children aged 
6 years and older.
Confi
 rmation of cases with Ebola virus disease was 
done independently of the study team as part of the 
national surveillance of Ebola virus disease, throughout 
and beyond the follow-up period of the trial. Confi
 rmatory 
retesting of samples of index cases and endpoints 
augmented the independence of the process.
Although eligible individuals in the delayed arm had 
two opportunities to consent (day 0 and day 21), those 
consenting at day 21 could only do so if they had not been 
diagnosed with Ebola virus disease in the intervening 
time. We therefore also presented a comparison of the 
vaccine eff
 ect with individuals in the delayed group who

strategy could be highly eff
 ective in controlling future 
outbreaks of Ebola virus disease.35 The fi
 ndings from 
Ebola ça Suffi
  t showed that it is feasible to undertake 
effi
  cacy trials in the challenging circumstances of 
epidemics. Vaccine trial designs using case-reactive 
strategies similar to those of the ring vaccination trial 
might have an application in future haemorrhagic fever 
outbreaks and in other infectious disease epidemics.
