Professional medical conferences over the past five years have seen an enormous increase in the use of Twitter
in real-time, also known as “live-tweeting”. At the United States and Canadian Academy of Pathology (USCAP)
2015 annual meeting, 24 attendees (the authors) volunteered to participate in a live-tweet group, the
#InSituPathologists. This group, along with other attendees, kept the world updated via Twitter about the
happenings at the annual meeting. There were 6,524 #USCAP2015 tweets made by 662 individual Twitter users;
these generated 5,869,323 unique impressions (potential tweet-views) over a 13-day time span encompassing the
dates of the annual meeting. Herein we document the successful implementation of the first official USCAP
annual meeting live-tweet group, including the pros/cons of live-tweeting and other experiences of the original
#InSituPathologists group members. No prior peer-reviewed publications to our knowledge have described in
depth the use of an organized group to “live-tweet” a pathology meeting. We believe our group to be the first of
its kind in the field of pathology.

 networks serve as a force amplifier with real-time
communication linking individuals to data as soon
as it is generated. Once limited to the personal realm,
social media and social networking have quickly
developed utility as a tool for physician learning and
interaction.
Twitter, a popular social network microblogging
platform introduced in 2006, allows users to rapidly
send
short
140
character
‘tweets’
or
messages.
Importantly, these ‘tweets’ can also include pictures,
videos, internet links, and mentions of other Twitter
users. Users can also tag messages using ‘hashtags’, a
form of searchable and clickable labels, denoted by
the # symbol. Hashtags allow Twitter users to easily
find tweets of interest.
Using
a
free
application
easily
accessed
on
smartphones or computer, Twitter users can quickly
send tweets to their followers who in turn can
retweet (share a tweet with their own followers),
reply (respond to the original tweet and initiate a
discussion), like, or mention a particular interesting
posting.1 As tweets are by default public, dedicated
Twitter users can quickly develop a large following
and reach a large number of individuals with even a
single message.
As a highly visual specialty, pathology is especially
conducive to this form of asynchronous communica-
tion. An image of a particularly interesting case or a
presentation summary can rapidly be sent to followers
and discussed with colleagues. Literally at their
fingertips, most pathologists also have the ability to
easily take a high-quality picture, a feature of most
smartphones, through their microscope eyepieces,
and then share de-identified images via social media
stimulating instantaneous discussion and education
within a potentially worldwide forum.2,3
Professional medical conferences over the past 5
years have seen an enormous increase in the use of
Twitter in real time, also known as ‘live-tweeting’.4–7
The primary focus of pathology conferences includes
acquiring the most up-to-date research and conver-
sing with colleagues. Rather than supplant these
activities, including networking, which normally
occurs at pathology meetings, Twitter enhances
them by playing a complementary role in the rapid
dissemination
of
information.
Tweets,
with
conference-specific hashtags, allow research find-
ings from the meeting to quickly expand far beyond
the walls of the convention center. Tweets during
meetings also help other attendees keep up with
what they missed in a session they were unable to
attend.
Perhaps most importantly, Twitter allows pathol-
ogists to carry on conversations long after a con-
ference has ended. Anecdotally, we found that many
relationships developed by interactions between
pathologists on Twitter convert naturally into ‘real-
life’
socialization
and
networking.8
In
essence,
Twitter provides a free easily accessible medium
for the dissemination of new clinically relevant
information to a worldwide audience beyond the
confines of a conference or traditional subspecialty
journals.
Although pathologists are increasingly utilizing
social media, no prior peer-reviewed publications to
our knowledge have described in depth the use of an
organized
group
to
‘live-tweet’
a
pathology
meeting.9–13 We believe our group to be the first of
its kind in the field of pathology. Here we document
the successful implementation of the first official
United States and Canadian Academy of Pathology
(USCAP) annual meeting live-tweet group (referred
to as the ‘#InSituPathologists’) at the 2015 USCAP
annual meeting and its continuing success in 2016.14
Material and methods
Formation of the Live-Tweet Group
On February 16, 2015, one of the authors (JMG)
tweeted a ‘call to action’ among regular pathologist
users of Twitter asking for volunteers who were
interested in live-tweeting the upcoming USCAP
2015 annual meeting (March 21–27, 2015; Boston,
Massachusetts, USA) (Figure 1).15 This invitation
was greeted with enthusiastic approval, and a group
of Twitter users was formed. Dr Gardner then
contacted the Executive Vice President of USCAP,
Dr David Kaminsky, explaining the concept and
requesting
formal
approval
of
the
group.
The
Academy embraced the idea and formally supported
the group. Dr Gardner polled group members for a
potential name for this live-tweet group. Dr Samson
Fine suggested (and a majority vote approved) the
hashtag/name #InSituPathologists.
Twitter Quantitative Analysis and Survey Metrics
Symplur.com, a healthcare-based Twitter metrics
website, was used to analyze tweets and impressions
(potential tweet views) that contained the registered
#USCAP2015 hashtag. This website tracks Twitter-
related activities centered on hashtags as part of the
Healthcare Hashtag Project.16 Information concern-

of hashtags (#USCAP2015), tagging/mentions of other users
(@TheUSCAP), and retweeting within a 140 character message.15

 during the conference period was retrospectively
reviewed.
All members of the official #InSituPathologists
group were subsequently contacted to voluntarily
answer 7 free-text survey questions (Table 1) regard-
ing their experience live-tweeting at USCAP 2015 to
provide feedback.
Results
Formation and Demographics of the USCAP 2015 Live-
Tweet Group
Twenty-four volunteer attendees participated in the
USCAP 2015 #InSituPathologists live-tweet group.
Members wore Twitter committee badge ribbons
on their identification tags and agreed to ‘live-tweet’
during
the
conference
using
the
approved
#USCAP2015
hashtag.
With
the
help
of
Ethan
Kaminsky (founder of Kaminsky Productions and
marketing and advertising consultant for USCAP), a
poster (Figure 2) was created showing the members of
the live-tweet group and their credentials. This poster
was shared on Twitter ahead of the meeting and was
prominently displayed at the USCAP meeting to
encourage participants to follow live-tweets using
the conference specific #USCAP2015 hashtag.
The 24-member live-tweet group was composed of
11 academic pathologists, 3 private practice pathol-
ogists, 8 pathology trainees, 1 senior medical student
pursuing pathology residency, and 1 breast cancer
survivor and patient advocate. In addition to general
surgical pathology, group members represented the
following pathology subspecialties: bone and soft
tissue pathology, cytopathology, dermatopathology,
genitourinary
pathology,
gynecologic
pathology,
head and neck pathology, hematopathology, mole-
cular pathology, and pulmonary pathology. All
members were in practice or training in the United
States
except
for
one
pathologist
practicing
in
Turkey. The following states were represented in
the group: Arkansas (2), Georgia (1), Illinois (1),
Indiana (1), Maryland (1), Massachusetts (1), Michi-
gan (2), New York (4), North Carolina (2), Pennsyl-
vania (1), Rhode Island (1), Texas (5), and Wisconsin
(1). The members had been Twitter users for an
average of 3 years (range: o1–6 years). Age was not
asked in the survey, but one member of the group
included this comment voluntarily: ‘I think I am the
oldest InSituPathologist by far, so if you want to
mention my age (63), that may encourage other
(pathologists in this age range) to climb on the
Twitter bandwagon.’
Quantitative Analysis Results
Using analytic data metrics from the healthcare metric
site Symplur.com, 6524 #USCAP2015 tweets created
5 869 323 unique impressions over a 13-day time span
encompassing
the
dates
of
the
annual
meeting
(Figure 3). A total of 662 individual Twitter users
posted tweets using the conference hashtag; 68% of
postings included a retweet. The top 10 #USCAP2015
utilizers
posted
a
combined
2840
tweets
with
3 529 464 impressions (60.4% of the total impres-
sions).17 The members of the #InSituPathologists live-
tweet group contributed 2199 tweets, accounting for
33.9%
of
the
total
tweets
about
#USCAP2015.
Symplur.com tracks potential impressions (the num-
ber of times tweets were delivered to the Twitter
streams of other users and potentially viewed) rather
than actual impressions (the number of times tweets
were actually seen by other users); throughout this
article, the term ‘impressions’ refers to potential
impressions rather than actual impressions.
The greatest number of tweets was seen on the first
day
of the conference
(1746
tweets) (Figure
4).
Throughout the actual dates of the meeting (21–27
March 2015), the average rate of tweeting about
#USCAP2015 overall (not just limited to the live-
tweet group) was 36 tweets per hour with an average
of
10
tweets
per
user.18
The
dissemination
of
#USCAP2015-tagged tweets continued past the con-
ference with an additional 566 246 unique impressions
and
909
tweets using the
#USCAP2015
hashtag
occurring in the days immediately after the meeting
ended. Tweets from the 2015 annual meeting are still
being
occasionally
retweeted,
having
a
potential
impact even 17 months after the end of the meeting.
As of the time of the preparation of this manuscript,
the most recent #USCAP2015 retweet (by someone
other than one of the authors) was on 26 August
2016.19

 meetings. Although the responses varied, a few
general themes were voiced among the majority of
participants.
Rather than a static experience, live-tweeting felt
interactive and participants enjoyed the real-time
dynamic conversations. One respondent described it

 as a ‘more engaging experience’ and likened it to
driving a high-performance sports car. Many parti-
cipants also noted the value of using Twitter as a
personal educational adjunct. The ability to distill a
conference topic into a short 140 character pearl or
summary PowerPoint image was rewarding and a
good way to condense lecture material into a more
manageable
learning
experience.
Another
main
benefit was being able to ‘attend’ multiple concur-
rent conferences simultaneously by following live-
tweets from concurrent lectures that would other-
wise have been missed. Multiple participants men-
tioned
camaraderie
and
networking
as
key
advantages. Beyond the personal benefits provided
by live-tweeting at the USCAP conference, partici-
pants felt rewarded in reaching a worldwide audi-
ence. In particular, there was recognition that many
international pathologists and pathology trainees do
not have the opportunity to directly attend USCAP.
Through Twitter, these participants can enhance
their own professional knowledge in a way that may
not have been possible otherwise.
There were also a few negative elements to the
live-tweet experience. One common criticism felt
was the potential for distraction from the lecture
attended when live-tweeting. Constant tweeting can
also lead to a feeling of Twitter fatigue or burnout.
Time spent on Twitter cannot only be a distraction
during the lectures but can also detract from face-to-
face ‘real-life’ interaction with colleagues. Several
members of the group were also concerned that
obtrusively using their phone to tweet during a
lecture might make them appear rude or inattentive
to the speaker or to other members of the audience.
Members of the group received positive feedback
from a variety of sources regarding the live-tweets
from #USCAP2015; comments came from indivi-
duals including pathology colleagues, international
pathologists,
physicians
from
other
specialties
(oncology, radiology, etc), patients and even non-
medical members of the public who were curious
about what occurs at a pathology meeting.
Survey responses were compiled to produce a
summary
list
of
10
‘dos
and
do
nots’
for
first-time users of Twitter at pathology conferences
(Table 2).
Implementation of Live-Tweeting for #USCAP2016
In preparation for the 2016 USCAP annual meeting,
it quickly became apparent that there was an
enormous increase in interest in Twitter among
pathologists attending. The USCAP social media
subcommittee decided to make an open invitation
for
the
2016
#InSituPathologists
group
and
instructed anyone wanting to be included to just
tweet ‘sign me up for #InSituPathologists’ and to tag
the @TheUSCAP Twitter account.20 Badge ribbons
were distributed at the meeting for live-tweet group
participants.
Approximately
275
different
users
utilized the #InSituPathologists hashtag in the month
leading up to the 2016 USCAP meeting. Although
not a perfect measure, this suggests that some-
where in the range of 200–300 pathologists on
Twitter indicated a willingness to live-tweet the
#USCAP2016 meeting. During the time period of the
2016 meeting, there were nearly 19 000 tweets, made
by over 1200 different users, which had the potential
to be viewed over 28.5 million times (Figure 5).
Discussion
The use of meeting-specific Twitter hashtags to
increase communication has rapidly grown in the
last 5 years. A number of large clinical specialty
annual meetings, including the American Society of
Clinical Oncology, the American Urologic Associa-
tion, the International Conference on Emergency
Medicine, the American Society of Breast Surgeons,
and the Academic Surgical Congress have documen-
ted the successful use of live-tweeting at their
meetings.5,21–24
To
the
best
of
our
knowledge,
however, there has not yet been a peer-reviewed
publication documenting in depth the organized
live-tweeting of a pathology meeting and the use of a
pathology conference-specific hashtag.
Although a small grassroots effort, the initial
USCAP
official
live-tweet
team
and
the
#USCAP2015 hashtag were a strong success with
45 million potential tweet-views generated. The
endeavor was likely the largest formally organized
pathology-related live-tweet group in history as of
the date of the USCAP 2015 annual meeting. Using
negligible resources aside from volunteered time,
live-tweeting increased the learning opportunities
for both pathologists at the conference and for those
who could not attend USCAP both nationally and
around the world. In addition, the use of the
conference- and diagnosis-specific hashtags allowed
informative, timely, and pertinent information from
USCAP to reach our clinical colleagues in other
specialties.25
The use of an official organized live-tweet group
served a number of purposes by ensuring a large
proportion of the #USCAP2015 tweets contained
quality informative messages from trusted and vetted
Twitter users (33.9% of total tweets from the meeting
were made by members of our group). Because of the
diversity of the #InSituPathologists group, including
senior academic pathologists, younger subspecialty
practicing pathologists, trainees, and a patient care
advocate, a broader variety of opinions and topics of
discussion were generated by our tweets, thus
appealing to a potentially wider audience. Hashtag
utilization metrics via Symplur.com, as well as
individual Twitter user analytic data via Twitter
Analytics, provided a wealth of free granular data
about the use of Twitter at the annual meeting,
which may serve a valuable purpose to attendees as
well as future annual meeting organizers.

 In addition, the Twitter metrics provided power-
ful,
tangible
evidence
of
the
success
of
the
#InSituPathologists live-tweet group. What started
out as a grassroots social media experiment in
February 2015 resulted in over 6500 tweets about
the
#USCAP2015
annual
meeting
at
negligible
financial cost to the organization. These metrics
helped facilitate the subsequent formation of the
Table 2 Ten dos and do nots: rules for live-tweeting at a pathology meeting
(1) Photos are golden
Tweets with pictures get more interaction and avoid the limitations of 140 character messages. People
will pay attention if the eye is drawn to something interesting.
(2) Thoughts are good, pearls of
wisdom are better
Tweet intellectual nuggets or pearls that are not commonly known or that correct a common
misconception. A thoughtful comment is better than an immediate play-by-play statement. Use a triad
of factoids to enhance memorization.
(3) Be respectful
Respect proprietary or embargoed information and give credit for content. While in session, be
courteous to those around you in the audience both when typing and when taking pictures.
(4) Use hashtags
Use the meeting hashtag (eg—#USCAP2016) and a specialty-specific hashtag (eg—#pathology,
#dermpath, #GIpath, #GUpath, etc). This allows others interested in these topics to more easily find
your tweet among all the rest. Pathology hashtag list: http://goo.gl/8iludP
(5) Find balance
Do not focus too much on your phone and miss the point or lessons of the talk. Do not tweet
constantly; take the time to be present in the session to enjoy the meeting. Avoid burnout.
(6) Do not be afraid to interact
Do not be afraid to interface with other Twitter users. Reply to tweets with questions or comments to
initiate conversations. Use the ‘quote tweet’ function to retweet excellent points made by others while
adding your own comments and insights. Expressing a valuable point and/or providing expertise
amplifies the quality of information.
(7) Stay transparent and
professional
Including a professional picture and academic/hospital affiliations in your Twitter profile adds
credibility and background information to your content.
(8) Diversify the live- tweet
process
Tweeting in subspecialty conferences or individual companion pathology society meetings
(ie—Arthur Purdy Stout Society) rather than just the plenary session is an opportunity for live-tweet
users to provide valuable information on a conference that others may not be able to attend.
(9) Avoid divisive or derogatory
content
As with any social media platform, be aware that personal comments and non-professional opinions
are publicly viewable. Even if you delete your tweet later, there is no way to ensure that someone else
has not already saved or shared it. If you would not want your grandmother to read it, do not tweet it.
(10) Retweeting is your friend
Retweeting and including internet links or references helps disseminate useful postings. Other users
will begin to value you as you are promoting their content and helping build their followers. In turn,
retweeting helps you pick up more followers, too. Clicking the meeting hashtag or #pathology are
good starting points for finding tweets to retweet.

The
increase
in
Twitter
activity
between
#USCAP2015 and #USCAP2016 was explosive. Just
1 year after our initial efforts, we saw ~ 29 million
impressions generated at #USCAP2016. In compar-
ison with 2015, the 2016 annual meeting had double
the number of Twitter users, triple the number of
tweets, and quadruple the number of impressions.26
These levels of growth showcase the reach of Twitter
and demonstrate its effectiveness when successfully
applied to the field of pathology.
As an example, live-tweeting during the 2015
USCAP meeting afforded a real-time dissemination of
the announcement and public reception of the termi-
nology evolution from ‘encapsulated follicular variant
of papillary thyroid carcinoma’ to the new nomencla-
ture ‘noninvasive follicular thyroid neoplasm with
papillary-like nuclear features’ (NIFTP), a major shift
in the practice of thyroid cancer treatment that was first
announced at #USCAP2015.27 The announcement by
the Endocrine Pathology Society was immediately
tweeted by one of the original authors of the paper
and by numerous other meeting attendees.28 A full year
before the manuscript was published by Nikiforov et al
and before The New York Times prominently described
this paradigm shift to the lay public, NIFTP was already
being actively discussed publicly on Twitter due to
#InSituPathologists
who
live-tweeted
it
from
the
USCAP 2015 annual meeting.29
Summary
In just 1 year from our original grassroots efforts to
coordinate live-tweet coverage of the #USCAP2015
annual meeting, the #InSituPathologists live-tweeting
concept has taken on a life of its own. All that was
needed was an initial push and a dedicated group of
pathologists to demonstrate the value and benefits of
live-tweeting at pathology meetings. The authors
believe that the initial #InSituPathologists group
played a critical role in providing that impetus, and
we look forward to seeing continued growth and
positive impact from live-tweeting at #USCAP2017
and other pathology meetings far into the future.
