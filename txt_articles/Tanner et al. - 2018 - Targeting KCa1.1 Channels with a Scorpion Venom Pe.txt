ABSTRACT
Fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLSs) are a key cell type involved in
rheumatoid arthritis (RA) progression. We previously identified
the KCa1.1 potassium channel (Maxi-K, BK, Slo 1, KCNMA1) as
a regulator of FLSs and found that KCa1.1 inhibition reduces
disease severity in RA animal models. However, systemic
KCa1.1 block causes multiple side effects. In this study, we
aimed to determine whether the KCa1.1 b1-3–specific venom
peptide blocker iberiotoxin (IbTX) reduces disease severity in
animal models of RA without inducing major side effects. We used
immunohistochemistry to identify IbTX-sensitive KCa1.1 subunits
in joints of rats with a model of RA. Patch-clamp and functional
assays were used to determine whether IbTX can regulate FLSs
through targeting KCa1.1. We then tested the efficacy of IbTX in
ameliorating disease in two rat models of RA. Finally, we determined
whether IbTX causes side effects including incontinence or tremors
in rats, compared with those treated with the small-molecule
KCa1.1 blocker paxilline. IbTX-sensitive subunits of KCa1.1 were
expressed by FLSs in joints of rats with experimental arthritis. IbTX
inhibited KCa1.1 channels expressed by FLSs from patients with
RA and by FLSs from rat models of RA and reduced FLS
invasiveness. IbTX significantly reduced disease severity in two
rat models of RA. Unlike paxilline, IbTX did not induce tremors or
incontinence in rats. Overall, IbTX inhibited KCa1.1 channels on
FLSs and treated rat models of RA without inducing side effects
associated with nonspecific KCa1.1 blockade and could become
the basis for the development of a new treatment of RA.
Introduction
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic, systemic autoim-
mune disease affecting approximately 1.3 million people in the
United States. It involves inflammation of the synovial joints
(Helmick et al., 2008). Fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLSs) are
resident synovial joint cells that play a central role in the
progression of RA. These cells develop a highly invasive
phenotype and secrete proteases, growth factors, and proin-
flammatory cytokines and chemokines, leading to joint deg-
radation (Bartok and Firestein, 2010; Bottini and Firestein,
2013). This invasive phenotype is a hallmark of FLSs in RA, as
their level of ex vivo invasiveness is correlated with radio-
graphic damage in patients with RA (Tolboom et al., 2005) and
with histologic changes in rodents (Laragione et al., 2008).
Current therapeutics for RA are focused on suppressing the
immune component of RA and no current therapeutics have
been designed to specifically target FLSs (Kahlenberg and
Fox, 2011).
FLSs from patients with RA (RA-FLSs) and from rats with
the pristane-induced arthritis (PIA) model of RA express the
KCa1.1 potassium channel (Maxi-K, BK, Slo 1, KCNMA1) at
their plasma membrane (Hu et al., 2012; Tanner et al., 2015;
Peth}
o et al., 2016; Beeton, 2017). Inhibiting the expression or
function of this channel reduces FLS invasiveness, prolifera-
tion, and protease secretion, while modulating cellular adhe-
sion and integrin regulation (Hu et al., 2012; Tanner et al.,
2015, 2017a). Furthermore, blocking KCa1.1 with the small-
molecule inhibitor paxilline reduces disease severity in PIA
and in the collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) rat models of RA
(Tanner et al., 2015).
Although paxilline was efficacious at treating disease in
these rat models of RA, its development as a potential therapeu-
tic is limited by its side effects. Pore-forming a subunits of
KCa1.1 are found in a variety of tissues, including the central
nervous system (CNS), smooth muscle, testis, pancreas, and
kidney, in addition to FLSs (Uebele et al., 2000; Poulsen et al.,
2009). Paxilline blocks KCa1.1 through allosteric binding to the

 pore-forming a subunit (Sanchez and McManus, 1996) and its
systemic administration leads to KCa1.1 block throughout the
body, causing detrimental side effects that preclude its use in
humans (Meredith et al., 2004; Imlach et al., 2008).
Although KCa1.1 a subunits have a wide tissue distribu-
tion, many KCa1.1 channels are physically associated with
regulatory b subunits that affect channel gating and activa-
tion and have restricted tissue distributions. Highly invasive,
CD44high, cadherin-11high, and podoplaninhigh RA-FLSs ex-
press KCa1.1 containing the b3 subunit (Peth}
o et al., 2016). In
contrast, KCa1.1 a in the CNS is associated with the b4
subunit, while the b1 subunit is expressed in smooth muscle
cells. Because of the limited tissue distribution of KCa1.1 with
the b3 subunit (Poulsen et al., 2009; Mannowetz et al., 2013;
Peth}
o et al., 2016), it may be possible to use a blocker that
affects KCa1.1 ab3, but not KCa1.1 ab4, as a step toward a
novel therapy of RA that would not induce side effects in the
CNS and as a proof of concept that targeting specific subunits
of KCa1.1 can be used for tissue-specific pharmacology.
Iberiotoxin (IbTX), a 37-amino-acid peptide from the venom
of the Buthus tamulus scorpion (Galvez et al., 1990; Yu et al.,
2016), is a selective KCa1.1 blocker that inhibits the channel
when it contains the b1, b2, or b3 subunits (Löhn et al., 2001;
Lippiat et al., 2003; Li et al., 2007) while having no effect on
KCa1.1 containing the b4 subunit found in the CNS (Wang
et al., 2014). IbTX may therefore inhibit FLSs through block-
ing KCa1.1 ab3, while leaving the CNS unaffected by sparing
KCa1.1 ab4. If IbTX is efficacious in treating models of RA, it
could serve as a scaffold for the development of KCa1.1 ab3-
specific blockers for the treatment of RA.
Here, we tested the hypothesis that IbTX can be used to
block KCa1.1 expressed by FLSs without inducing the side
effects observed with global KCa1.1 blockade. We show that
IbTX blocks KCa1.1 in RA-FLSs, PIA-FLSs, and CIA-FLSs
and also reduces their ex vivo invasiveness. We also show that
IbTX is effective at reducing disease severity in the PIA and
CIA rat models of RA and that paxilline, but not IbTX, induces
tremors and incontinence in rats. Taken together, our results
indicate IbTX as a tool for targeting FLSs without affecting
other cells expressing KCa1.1, thereby reducing side effects
associated with global KCa1.1 blockade.
Materials and Methods
Animals. Female dark agouti rats (Envigo, East Millstone, NJ)
and Lewis rats (Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, MA) aged
8–11 weeks were housed in autoclaved cages in an Association for
Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care–accredited
facility and given food and water ad libitum. All experiments involving
rats were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee at Baylor College of Medicine.
Immunohistochemistry, Histology, and X-Rays. Hind paws
from rats with either CIA or PIA were collected 14 or 21 days after
disease onset, respectively, at which time the disease had been severe
for a long duration and animals had noticeable significant pathologic
hallmarks of disease. X-rays were taken with an In Vivo Xtreme
Imaging System (Bruker, Billerica, MA). Paws were decalcified,
embedded in paraffin, sectioned, and stained for either safranin O/fast
green or hematoxylin/eosin or by immunohistochemistry. Analysis
and scoring of safranin O/fast green and hematoxylin/eosin-stained
samples was completed as described (Brenner et al., 2005) by an
investigator blinded to the treatment groups. For immunohistochem-
istry, sections were deparaffinized and hydrated before antigen
retrieval and blocking of nonspecific protein binding sites, peroxidase,
and alkaline phosphatase. Sections were incubated in primary
antibodies against cadherin-11 (MA1-06306; Invitrogen, Carlsbad,
CA), podoplanin (ab10288; Abcam, Cambridge, UK), KCa1.1 a (Neuro-
Mab 75-022 from Antibodies Inc., Davis, CA; or AB5228 from EMD
Millipore, Burlington, MA), and KCa1.1 b3 (PA5-32891; Invitrogen).
For detection, we used ImmPRESS anti-mouse and anti-rabbit IgG
conjugated to alkaline phosphatase and peroxidase, respectively,
followed by ImmPACT DAB and Vector Red substrates (Vector
Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Images of the synovial joints were
taken using an Olympus Q Color 5 camera on an Olympus BX41
microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) at 10� magnification and images
of synovium were taken at 40� magnification.
Cells. FLSs from patients with RA, diagnosed according to criteria
set forth by the American College of Rheumatology (Aletaha et al.,
2010), were isolated as described (Laragione and Gulko, 2010). Rat
FLSs were isolated as described (Laragione et al., 2008) from the hind
paws of rats with either CIA or PIA that had signs of disease for 14 or
21 days, respectively, at which time disease had been severe for a long
duration. All experiments were conducted with FLSs after passage 3.
Synthesis of IbTX. IbTX was synthesized on a Prelude Peptide
Synthesizer (Protein Technologies, Tucson, AZ) using an Fmoc-tBu
protecting strategy with all Cys residues protected as Cys(Trt).
Synthesis was initiated on Fmoc-Gln(Trt)-Wang resin (Peptides
International, Louisville, KY) using diisopropyl carbodiimide/Oxyma
activation chemistry. After synthesis of the linear sequence, the final
pyroglutamic acid was coupled manually also using diisopropyl
carbodiimide/Oxyma. The peptide was cleaved from the resin using an
acidolytic cleavage cocktail [trifluoroacetic acid (TFA)/anisole/H2O/triiso-
propyl silane/thioanisole, 9:0.2:0.2:0.2:0.2 (v/v)] for 2 hours at room
temperature. After cleavage from the resin and deprotection of the side
chain residues, the crude peptide was filtered to remove the spent resin
beads and precipitated into ice-cold diethyl ether and washed five times
with the same solvent. The crude peptide was subsequently dissolved in
50% aqueous acetic acid and diluted into water to a concentration of
0.2 mg/ml. The pH of this solution was adjusted to 7.8 with NH4OH and
glutathione was added to facilitate disulfide formation (0.1 mM glutathi-
one disulfide and glutathione). After 18-hour oxidation, the peptide was
monitored by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography
(RP-HPLC) for formation of the folded peptide, which shifts to a more
hydrophilic retention time. The pH of the folded peptide solution was
subsequently lowered with TFA to 4.0 and pumped onto a 5- � 60-cm
preparative RP-HPLC column (Luna C18-10 u, 100 Å pore size;
Phenomenex, Torrance, CA). The folded peptide was purified using a
gradient of 5%–35% acetonitrile versus 0.05% TFA in H2O over
90 minutes. The peptide fractions with a purity greater than 95% by
analytical RP-HPLC were pooled and lyophilized. The final peptide was
characterized by amino acid analysis and electrospray ionization–mass
spectrometry and coeluted with a reference sample of IbTX. Each batch
was tested by electrophysiology for KCa1.1 block on human embryonic
kidney 293 cells expressing KCa1.1 a.
Patch-Clamp Electrophysiology. FLSs were lifted with trypsin-
EDTA, washed, and patch clamped using a Port-a-Patch automated
system (Nanion Technologies, Munich Germany), as described (Hu
et al., 2012; Peth}
o et al., 2016; Tajhya et al., 2016).
Measuring FLS Invasiveness. Invasiveness of FLSs was de-
termined as described (Laragione et al., 2008; Hu et al., 2012).
Induction and Scoring of RA Models. PIA was induced in
female dark agouti rats by a subcutaneous injection of 150 ml pristane
(MP Biomedicals, Santa Ana, CA) at the base of the tail, as described
(Beeton et al., 2006; Tarcha et al., 2012). CIA was induced in female
Lewis rats (Griffiths et al., 1992) by a subcutaneous injection of 200 ml
of 2 mg/ml porcine type II collagen (Chondrex, Redmond, WA) in a 1:1
emulsion with incomplete Freund’s adjuvant (Difco, Detroit, MI).
Seven days later, rats were given a booster injection of 100 ml of the
same emulsion.
Disease onset was defined by at least one swollen or red joint.
Clinical scores were determined daily for each rat as described (Tarcha
228
Tanner et al.
 at ASPET Journals on June 2, 2019

Downloaded from 
 et al., 2012). For each rat, five points were given for each red or swollen
ankle or wrist and one point for each red or swollen toe joint, with a
maximum possible score of 60 for each rat. Upon disease onset, rats
were randomly assigned to receive either vehicle, IbTX subcutane-
ously, or paxilline intraperitoneally every other day. Randomization of
rats to treatment groups was done by assigning every other rat that
developed signs of disease on a given day to the same treatment group
so that each group was composed of rats that developed signs of
disease across the same timeframe and without regard to basal
disease severity on the day each rat had noticeable paw inflammation.
The number of rats per treatment group was determined using power
analysis with a power of 0.8 and an a of 0.5 and based off of previous
experiments testing KCa1.1 blockers in rat models of RA, as described
(Tanner et al., 2015).
Tremor Measurements. Lewis rats were treated with either
dimethylsulfoxide, 20 mg/kg paxilline, or 0.5 mg/kg IbTX and placed
in a suspended chamber 10 minutes, 1 hour, and 24 hours after
treatment. An iPhone 6 (Apple, Cupertino, CA) was attached to the
bottom, outer surface of the chamber and tremors were measured
through the phone’s built-in accelerometer with vibration measure-
ment and recording completed with the VibSensor application (Now
Instruments and Software Inc., Poway, CA) (Miyazaki et al., 2014)
over the course of 10 minutes. The acceleration data were root mean
square (RMS) transformed with smoothing across 0.1-second incre-
ments, as described (Feketa et al., 2013). To determine tremor
frequency over 10 minutes, a threshold above background RMS-
transformed acceleration of 0.15 m/s2 was set and a single tremor
event was counted as when the RMS-transformed acceleration passed
through this threshold. To determine tremor intensity, the integral of
the RMS-transformed acceleration was taken for a 1-minute period in
which the rat was not actively moving. Rats were monitored over the
course of measurements and data were excluded when a rat was
moving.
Incontinence Assays. Lewis rats were given either an intraper-
itoneal treatment of vehicle or 20 mg/kg paxilline (Fermentek,
Jerusalem, Israel) or a subcutaneous treatment of 0.5 mg/kg IbTX
and then given an oral gavage of 1 ml water. They were then placed
individually in paper towel–lined cages. After 1 hour, the number of
urine spots each rat produced was counted in the dark using a black
light (Meredith et al., 2004).
Statistical Analysis. All data are presented as the mean 6 S.E.M.
Differences between groups were determined using Mann–Whitney U
tests or matched-pairs t tests. A P value less than 0.05 was considered
statistically significant.
Results
Detection KCa1.1 b3 in CIA Joints. We previously
found that FLSs from rats with PIA express KCa1.1 and that
their invasion is modulated by channel activity and expression
(Tanner et al., 2015). Because ion channel subunit expression
can differ between species and animal models (Tanner and
Beeton, 2018), we assayed the in vivo expression of FLS
expression of KCa1.1 a and b3 within the synovial paw joints
of rats with CIA, using cadherin-11 and podoplanin as
markers for FLSs. Cadherin-111 and podoplanin1 cells
expressed KCa1.1 a and b3 in CIA rat synovium (Fig. 1).
These data indicate that FLSs express KCa1.1 with the b3
subunit in vivo during CIA and therefore allow for the CIA rat
model to be used to assess the effect of KCa1.1 blockers at
targeting FLSs in vivo.
IbTX Blocks KCa1.1 Channels Expressed by FLSs
and Reduces FLS Invasiveness. Since the ability of IbTX
to block KCa1.1 channels depends on the regulatory b
subunits expressed (Wang et al., 2014) and channel sensitivity
to modulators can vary between species (Tanner and Beeton,
2018), we compared its effects on potassium channels from
RA-, PIA-, and CIA-FLSs. IbTX blocked the potassium
channels in all three cell types, with similar IC50 values in
the 2- to 10-nM range previously described for IbTX on KCa1.1
lacking b4 subunits (Tauc et al., 1993; Meera et al., 2000):
2.2 6 0.3 nM for RA-FLSs, 2.6 6 0.7 nM for PIA-FLSs, and
3.7 6 0.8 nM for CIA-FLSs (Fig. 2A).
The small-molecule KCa1.1 blocker paxilline reduces the
ex vivo invasiveness of RA- and PIA-FLSs (Hu et al., 2012;
Tanner et al., 2015). Similar to paxilline, IbTX significantly
reduced the number of RA-, PIA-, and CIA-FLSs that invaded
through Matrigel-coated Transwell inserts (BD Biosciences,
Franklin Lakes, NJ) by approximately 50% (Fig. 2B).
IbTX Reduces Disease Severity in Two Rat Models of
RA. Upon disease onset, rats with PIA were treated with
vehicle or 0.05, 0.5, or 5 mg/kg IbTX subcutaneously every
other day. These doses were chosen because venom peptides
with a similar structure display efficacy in blocking their ion
channel target at doses of 0.1–0.5 mg/kg in animal models of
RA (Beeton et al., 2006; Tarcha et al., 2012; Tanner et al.,

 2017b). Rats treated with IbTX exhibited a greater than 50%
reduction in arthritis severity clinical scores compared with
those of vehicle-treated rats with PIA, with no differences
observed between rats treated with the different doses of IbTX
tested (Fig. 3A). In comparison, rats with PIA treated with
2 mg/kg paxilline exhibited only a slight reduction in disease
severity, whereas those treated with 20 mg/kg paxilline
exhibited a greater than 50% reduction in disease severity
(Fig. 3B), similar to IbTX and in agreement with our previous
findings (Tanner et al., 2015). Hematoxylin/eosin staining
and safranin O/fast green staining of joint sections in-
dicated that rats with PIA treated with 0.5 mg/kg IbTX
had fewer immune infiltrates, pannus extensions, synovial
hyperplasia, and cartilage erosions compared with vehicle-
treated animals (Fig. 3, C and D), whereas X-rays indicated
that PIA rats treated with 0.5 mg/kg IbTX had significantly
reduced bone damage compared with vehicle-treated rats
(Fig. 3E). FLSs isolated from 0.5 mg/kg IbTX-treated PIA
rats and cultured for at least three passages were signifi-
cantly less invasive compared with FLSs isolated from
vehicle-treated PIA rats and cultured for the same duration
(Fig. 3F). Their invasiveness was comparable to that of
FLSs from healthy rats.
To determine the efficacy of IbTX in rats that had already
developed severe paw inflammation, mimicking the RA pa-
tient with established disease, rats with PIA were treated
with 0.5 mg/kg IbTX or vehicle 7 days after they first exhibited
signs of disease, at which point paw inflammation was already
severe. PIA rats treated with IbTX every other day showed a
significant decrease in paw inflammation after a 3- to 4-day
lag time, whereas inflammation in vehicle-treated rats remained
severe (Fig. 4A). To determine how long IbTX remains effective
after cessation of treatment, rats with PIA were treated
with 0.5 mg/kg IbTX for only the first 7 days after disease
onset. IbTX-treated rats had significantly decreased paw in-
flammation on days 6 and 7 after the start of treatment;
however, disease severity returned to levels comparable to
vehicle after stopping treatment within 2 to 3 days (Fig. 4B).
To further verify the efficacy of IbTX in vivo, we tested it in
the CIA model of RA. Rats with CIA were treated with either
vehicle or 0.5 mg/kg IbTX every other day starting at disease
onset. Similar to results in PIA, rats treated with IbTX had
significantly less joint swelling compared with vehicle-treated
rats (Fig. 5A). CIA-FLSs isolated from IbTX-treated rats and
cultured for at least three passages were less invasive than
CIA-FLSs isolated from vehicle-treated rats and cultured for
the same duration (Fig. 5B). In addition, X-rays and histology
of paws indicated less bone damage, as well as fewer immune
infiltrates, pannus extensions, synovial hyperplasia, and
cartilage erosions, in IbTX-treated animals compared with
those treated with vehicle (Fig. 5, C–E).
Paxilline, But Not IbTX, Induces Tremors in Rats.
KCa1.1 channels composed of the a and b4 subunits are found
in the CNS and loss of neuronal KCa1.1 expression or function
causes tremors (Imlach et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2014). We
therefore tested whether paxilline and IbTX induce tremors in
rats. We chose doses of the blockers, 20 mg/kg paxilline and
0.5 mg/kg IbTX, which showed similar efficacy in the PIA and
CIA models of RA in terms of clinical signs, joint inflamma-
tion, and cartilage degradation (Figs. 3 and 5) (Tanner et al.,
2015). Vehicle-treated rats exhibited no tremors (Fig. 6A).
Paxilline-treated rats exhibited abrupt events of increased
acceleration (Fig. 6B), indicating the presence of tremor
events. IbTX-treated rats exhibited no tremors and displayed
acceleration measurements comparable to that of vehicle-
treated rats (Fig. 6C). By setting a threshold of 0.15 m/s2 above
the RMS-transformed data (Fig. 6, D–F) and counting the
number of events the RMS-transformed acceleration passed

 above this threshold, we determined that paxilline-treated
rats had approximately 14 6 4 tremor events during the
recordings 10 minutes after treatment (Fig. 6G). Tremor
frequency decreased over time. In sharp contrast, vehicle-
and IbTX-treated rats exhibited no tremors (Fig. 6G). Quan-
tifying tremors through the integral of the RMS-transformed
acceleration determined that paxilline-treated rats had high-
intensity tremors soon after treatment, which decreased over
time, while vehicle- and IbTX-treated rats did not exhibit such
changes in acceleration intensity (Fig. 6H). Taken together,
these data indicate that paxilline, but not IbTX, induces
tremors in rats.

 Paxilline, But Not IbTX, Induces Incontinence in
Rats. Considering that IbTX and paxilline both block KCa1.1
channels associated with the b1 subunit that is found in
smooth muscle, including that of the urinary bladder (Poulsen
et al., 2009), we tested whether they cause incontinence in
rats. Healthy Lewis rats were treated with either vehicle,
paxilline, or IbTX. An hour later, paxilline-treated rats
exhibited a large number of urine spots, indicating a lack of
bladder control. Surprisingly, IbTX-treated animals exhibited
a similar small number of urine spots as vehicle-treated rats
(Fig. 7). This indicates that IbTX does not induce incontinence,
whereas paxilline does.
Discussion
In this study, we validated the peptide KCa1.1 blocker IbTX
for efficacy in reducing the ex vivo invasiveness of FLSs from
patients with RA and from multiple rat models of RA. We also
show that IbTX reduces disease severity in both the PIA and
CIA rat models of RA, while not inducing tremors or in-
continence. Together, these data suggest IbTX as a potential
novel therapeutic for RA by inhibiting FLSs and without
inducing side effects seen with broad KCa1.1 blockade.
No animal model of RA fully recapitulates all aspects of the
human disease; we therefore assayed IbTX for efficacy in both
PIA and CIA, two well established models of RA in rats.
Although IbTX significantly reduced disease severity in both
models to a similar degree as paxilline (Tanner et al., 2015),
IbTX-treated animals still exhibited a significant amount of
paw inflammation. The inability of KCa1.1 blockers to
eliminate inflammation may be due to other cell types in-
volved in RA such as T lymphocytes, chondrocytes, and
osteoclasts, which may still have pathogenic phenotypes after
IbTX treatment (Lundy et al., 2007; Otero and Goldring, 2007;
Schett, 2007). IbTX likely does not have an effect on
T lymphocytes in RA because these cells express different
potassium channels from KCa1.1, which are insensitive to
IbTX and paxilline (Beeton and Chandy, 2005; Beeton et al.,
2011). Osteoclasts and chondrocytes express several potas-
sium channels, including
KCa1.1
(Arkett et al.,
1994;
Weidema et al., 2000; Mobasheri et al., 2012). The regulatory
b subunits of KCa1.1 expressed by these cells and whether
IbTX has an effect on their destructive functions during RA
have yet to be investigated. It is possible that a combined
therapy consisting of inhibitors specific for each of these cell
types will be needed to further reduce disease severity in
models of RA. Alternatively, it may be possible for a combined
treatment of IbTX with a currently available RA therapy, such
as a tumor necrosis factor-a antagonist, to have an additive
effect at treating RA by using IbTX to target FLSs and a
currently available therapy to reduce inflammation.
We examined the effect of KCa1.1 blockers on the in vitro
invasion of FLSs that were passaged multiple times. From
this, we infer that KCa1.1 blockers reduce disease severity in
rat models of RA at least in part from reducing FLS invasion
in vivo. Passaging these cells is a standard practice to isolate
FLSs and is necessary to obtain a population solely composed
of FLSs without any contaminating macrophage-like syno-
viocytes, synovial-infiltrating immune cells, or endothelial
cells that either die or are washed away through multiple
in vitro passages (Rosengren et al., 2007; Bartok and Fire-
stein, 2010). Passaged RA-FLSs and PIA-FLSs maintain a
high level of invasiveness and secrete proinflammatory
cytokines and proteases after passaging, indicating that
passaged FLSs maintain a pathogenic phenotype in vitro
(Laragione et al., 2008; Bartok and Firestein, 2010; Tanner
et al., 2015). The in vitro invasion of passaged FLSs is also
directly correlated with radiographic damage in patients
with RA, as well as in PIA (Tolboom et al., 2005; Laragione
et al., 2008). Furthermore, our data indicate that FLSs in the
synovium in situ of rats with CIA express KCa1.1 with the b3
subunit, supporting the notion that FLSs maintain similar
potassium channel phenotypes in vivo and in vitro. There-
fore, it is likely that the potassium channel phenotype of
FLSs and effects of KCa1.1 blockers on FLS phenotypes are
similar in vitro and in vivo.
PIA rats treated with IbTX for only the first week after
disease onset exhibited a rapid increase in joint swelling once
treatment ceased, indicating that IbTX was only efficacious
with continuous administration. This may be due to pro-
teolytic degradation of the peptide in vivo. Alternatively, as
IbTX has a molecular weight of only 4.231 kDa (below the
cutoff of 30–50 kDa for glomerular filtration), it could be
rapidly eliminated by renal clearance. The addition of poly-
ethylene glycol moieties is a widely used method to increase
the length of efficacy of therapeutics by reducing renal
clearance and decreasing the rate of proteolytic degradation
(Harris and Chess, 2003; Turecek et al., 2016). Creating a
PEGylated IbTX analog could therefore be used to increase its
length of efficacy. Indeed, such an approach has successfully
been used to improve the duration of efficacy of other venom-
derived peptide potassium channel blockers (Tanner et al.,
2017b).
In this study, we used a smartphone’s accelerometer to
measure tremors in rats. Other techniques used to measure
tremors in laboratory settings involve using electrodes implanted

 into the back muscles of rats and measuring contractions over
time (Feketa et al., 2013). Such techniques involve the use of
specialized equipment and software, as well as survival surgeries
that are stressful for the animals. Our technique using a
smartphone’s accelerometer is noninvasive and minimally
stressful for the rats, as it requires no surgery, and is more
cost-effective compared with surgical interventions. In addition,
this technique was effective at quantifying the tremors observed
in paxilline-treated rats and at differentiating the presence and
absence of tremors, making it a valuable technique to quickly
screen whether potential drugs are tremorigenic in vivo.
Similar accelerometer-based technologies have also been
used to observe tremors in rats and mice (Shih and Young,
2007; Miyazaki et al., 2014) and smartphone-based acceler-
ometry applications have even been used to monitor tremors
in patients with Parkinson’s disease (Joundi et al., 2011;
Kostikis et al., 2015).

 improvement in clinical signs of disease (Tanner et al., 2015).
IbTX at doses of 0.05–5 mg/kg subcutaneously every other
day gave a similar efficacy as paxilline in treating CIA and
PIA. This discrepancy in dosing efficacy was due to venom-
derived potassium channel blocking peptides creating a
depot under the skin when given subcutaneously and
entering the circulation over hours (Tarcha et al., 2012).
This allows for small doses to provide sustained benefit, as
opposed to giving a bolus of paxilline intraperitoneally with a
half-life of less than 1 hour (Tanner et al., 2015).
Paxilline is a well known tremorgenic compound, as it is a
lipophilic small molecule that can cross membranes to enter
the CNS and other tissues and blocks KCa1.1 channels
regardless of b subunit expression (Imlach et al., 2008). For
these reasons, we also expected that paxilline would induce
incontinence (Meredith et al., 2004). The lack of tremor

 induction by IbTX was anticipated, as this peptide blocks
KCa1.1 only in the absence of b4 subunits and these subunits
are widely expressed in the CNS. The lack of incontinence in
rats treated with IbTX was surprising, because this is induced
by the targeting of KCa1.1 expressed by smooth muscle cells in
the urinary bladder. These cells express the b1 subunit of
KCa1.1 and IbTX blocks KCa1.1 containing this subunit.
However, smooth muscle cells are separated from the circula-
tion by endothelial cells and from the urine by bladder
epithelial cells. IbTX is likely unable to cross these barriers
and therefore unable to reach the smooth muscle cell KCa1.1
channels.
Our studies of potential side effects associated with blocking
KCa1.1 focused on tremors and incontinence. However, due to
the tissue distribution of this channel, there may be other side
effects from blocking KCa1.1. These include hypertension, as
KCa1.1 associated with the b1 subunit is found in the smooth
muscle of blood vessels in rats (Brenner et al., 2000; Poulsen
et al., 2009). Given our results indicating a lack of effect of
IbTX on the urinary bladder, it is likely that IbTX also does not
affect vascular smooth muscle, which is separated from the
circulation by a layer of endothelium that IbTX may not be
able to cross. Male fertility may also be affected, as KCa1.1
associated with the b3 subunit is found in the rat testis and
human spermatozoa (Poulsen et al., 2009; Mannowetz et al.,
2013). However, IbTX may not be able to cross through the
blood-testis barrier. Furthermore, KCa1.1 associated with the
b2 subunit is found in the human pancreas and kidney and
blocking this channel may have detrimental effects on these
tissues as well (Uebele et al., 2000). To more completely
validate IbTX as a therapeutic for use in humans, these side
effects associated with KCa1.1 block in these tissues will need
to be examined. It is indeed possible that IbTX, as well as
paxilline, will induce side effects from affecting these tissues,
as IbTX can block KCa1.1 associated with subunits b1–b3 or
with no b subunits. If this is the case, it may be necessary to
identify any unique splice variants of KCa1.1 pore-forming a
subunits expressed by FLSs and generate a KCa1.1 blocker
specific for this unique aspect, along with the b3 subunit, of
the channel to create a more viable therapeutic for RA.
Regardless, our findings that IbTX does not induce tremors
or incontinence show that selectively inhibiting KCa1.1 in a b
subunit–specific manner can be a viable means of treating
diseases mediated by this potassium channel without inhibit-
ing all variants of this channel.
Overall, this study indicates the KCa1.1 potassium channel
blocker IbTX as an inhibitor of the invasive phenotype of FLSs
and that IbTX reduces disease severity in two rat models of
RA. We have also shown that KCa1.1 block with IbTX
eliminates two major side effects observed during systemic
KCa1.1 blockade with small molecules and in mice lacking
KCa1.1 a expression (Meredith et al., 2004; Imlach et al.,
2008). Taken together, these data indicate IbTX as either
a potential novel therapeutic for the treatment of RA
by targeting KCa1.1 channels expressed on FLSs or as a
scaffold for the future generation of RA-FLS–selective KCa1.1
blockers.
