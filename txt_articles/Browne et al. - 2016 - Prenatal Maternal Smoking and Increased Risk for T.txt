Objective: We assessed the role of prenatal maternal
smoking in risk for Tourette syndrome and chronic tic
disorder (TS/CT) and pediatric-onset obsessive-compul-
sive disorder (OCD).
Method: In an analysis of 73,073 singleton pregnancies
from the Danish National Birth Cohort, we calculated
incidence rates (IR) per 1,000 person-year for TS/CT and
OCD. We then determined crude and adjusted hazard
ratios and 95% CIs associated with prenatal maternal
smoking, considering smoking as a dichotomous (yes/no)
variable or a stratified variable (no smoking, light smok-
ing, and heavy smoking [�10 cigarettes/day]). Additional
analyses examined the effect of maternal smoking on risk
for TS/CT with other comorbid psychiatric conditions.
Results: In final adjusted analyses, heavy smoking was
associated with a 66% increased risk for TS/CT (adjusted
hazard ratio ¼ 1.66, 95% CI ¼ 1.17�2.35). In addition,
heavy smoking was associated with a 2-fold increased risk
for TS/CT with comorbid attention-deficit/hyperactivity
disorder (ADHD), and both light and heavy smoking
were associated with a more than 2-fold increased risk for
TS/CT with any non-ADHD psychiatric comorbidity. Our
parallel analyses of pediatric-onset OCD were likely un-
derpowered but showed similar relationships.
Conclusion: Prenatal maternal smoking was associated
with increased risk for TS/CT as well as TS/CT with co-
morbid psychiatric conditions, even after adjustment for
several important variables, including maternal psychiat-
ric history, socioeconomic status, and partner smoking.
Our findings point to a pathway linking prenatal tobacco
exposure and altered brain development to TS/CT.

T
ourette syndrome (TS) and chronic tic disorder (CT)
are related pediatric-onset, neuropsychiatric disorders
and frequently co-occur with obsessive-compulsive
disorder (OCD) in individuals and within families.1-4 There
is substantial evidence for a genetic contribution to the eti-
ology of both TS/CT and OCD.5 Twin and family studies
provide heritability estimates of 30% to 60% for each disor-
der6-11; these reports are supported by a recent study
considering inherited common genetic variation that esti-
mated heritability at 58% for TS and 37% for OCD with
substantial shared risk between the disorders.12 How envi-
ronment contributes to risk for TS/CT and OCD is less well
established, but various factors such as birth complications,
maternal mood, maternal autoimmune disease, and peri-
natal smoking have been suggested as putative risks.6-9,13-20
Prenatal maternal smoking has been associated with
several
neuropsychiatric
disorders
including
attention-
deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD),21 schizophrenia,22
and

disorder
(ASD),23
although
the
precise nature of the risk relationship remains to be deter-
mined. Previous literature on the role of prenatal maternal
smoking in TS/CT and OCD offers mixed results. Some
studies identify prenatal maternal smoking as a risk factor
for TS/CT14,24 (or tic severity25), whereas other studies
report no association16,26; smoking has been more consis-
tently identified as a risk factor for TS with comorbid
ADHD.16,24,27 Studies of maternal prenatal smoking in OCD
risk are very limited, with both positive25 and negative
findings.17,28 Many prior studies exploring environmental
risk
factors
for
TS/CT
and
OCD,
including
prenatal
maternal smoking, use retrospective data collection and/or
specialty clinic samples, rendering them susceptible to recall
and ascertainment biases and unclear generalizability. With
a few exceptions, the sample sizes are relatively small, likely
contributing to variable results among studies.
The Danish National Birth Cohort (DNBC) is a prospec-
tive cohort study of approximately 100,000 women enrolled
early in pregnancy from 1996 to 2002, with planned follow-
up for decades.29 The DNBC includes detailed quantitative
information on lifestyle, health, and health behaviors,
including prenatal smoking behavior and related covariates,
with prospectively obtained data, minimizing biases. The
aim of our study was to use DNBC data to assess the role
of prenatal maternal smoking in risk for TS/CT and
pediatric-onset OCD. We also investigated whether prenatal
maternal smoking was differentially associated with risk for

 TS/CT with comorbid ADHD or other comorbid psychiatric
diagnoses.
METHOD
The Danish Data Protection Agency, the DNBC Steering Committee,
and the Mount Sinai institutional review board approved this study.
Participants and Exposures
We ascertained data regarding all participants in the DNBC29 and
their offspring (up to age 15 years). Information about smoking and
other exposures during pregnancy was extracted from 3 research
interviews, conducted on average at the 17th and 32nd weeks of
gestation, and 6 months after birth (referencing the last part of the
pregnancy). For a dichotomous (yes/no) assessment of prenatal
smoking, women who answered “yes” to at least 1 of the following
questions were considered positive for prenatal maternal smoking:
Did you smoke during this pregnancy (first interview); Do you
smoke now (first and second interviews); Have you smoked since
the last interview (second interview); and, Did you smoke during
the last part of the pregnancy (third interview). Interviewers rated
99% of the responses to smoking-related questions as trustworthy.
To compare light and heavy prenatal smoking, maternal smok-
ing was a priori categorized as a 3-level variable (no smoking, light
smoking [<10 cigarettes/day], and heavy smoking [�10 cigarettes/
day]), calculated as the average number of cigarettes smoked across
the entire pregnancy as assessed at each of the 3 interviews.
Of note, of 55,817 participants with 0 average smoking during
pregnancy, a small number (1,923; 3.4%) reported smoking at some
point during pregnancy while responding “None” when asked
about the number of cigarettes smoked at each interval. This was
interpreted to reflect prior, occasional cigarettes but not current
smoking. In the analyses of maternal smoking as a dichotomous
variable, these individuals were classified as smokers. However, in
the analyses of maternal smoking as a variable with 3 categories
(nonsmoker, light smoker, and heavy smoker), this group was
categorized as nonsmokers. To ensure that this did not skew results,
we performed a sensitivity analysis on data related to smoking dose,
reconsidering this latter group as light smokers rather than non-
smokers, and observed similar results.
Outcomes
Information on psychiatric diagnoses in the offspring was obtained
by linkage to the Danish Psychiatric Central Register (DPCR)30 and
the Danish National Hospital Register (LPR).31 The International
Statistical Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) has been
used in Denmark since 1994.32 The outcomes of interest were TS/CT
(ICD-10 codes F95.1, F95.2) and OCD (ICD-10 codes F42.0, F42.1,
F42.2). In addition, we considered the broader category of tic dis-
orders, including transient and unspecified tic disorders (TS/CT
spectrum: ICD-10 codes F95.0, F95.1, F95.2, F95.8, F95.9) and the
broader category of OCD, including individuals with obsessive-
compulsive behaviors who do not meet full criteria for OCD
(OCD spectrum: ICD-10 codes F42.0, F42.1, F42.2, F42.8, F42.9).
Because TS/CT and OCD are related disorders with likely over-
lapping risk factors, we also considered TS/CT and OCD cases
combined. We investigated further the association between prenatal
smoking and TS/CT with comorbid ADHD (ICD-10 codes F90.0,
F90.1, F90.8, F90.9) or TS/CT with other comorbid psychiatric
diagnoses (ICD-10 codes F00-F99 excluding participants who
had ADHD).
Statistical Analyses
We calculated incidence rates per 1,000 person-year for each diag-
nostic category, then calculated crude hazard ratios (HR) and
adjusted hazard ratios (aHR) and 95% CI using Cox proportional
hazard models, with child’s age as the time scale (censor date:
October 7, 2013). To account for prevalence trends over time, we
adjusted for birth year in all analyses. Proportional hazard as-
sumptions were tested using Schoenfeld residuals. We adjusted for
possible confounders using multiple approaches. In addition to the
crude model (model 1), we ran 5 adjusted models with increasing
adjustment for confounders/covariates (models 2�6, with model 3
as our primary analysis).
In model 2, we adjusted for sex of the child, parity, birth year,
maternal age (15�24, 25�29, 30�34, and �35 years), and maternal
psychiatric history. In model 3, we adjusted for socioeconomic

 status27 (SES; low, middle, high), alcohol consumption (beer [<1,
1�3, >3 drinks per week], wine [<1, 1�3, >3 drinks per week], or
spirits [any drinking]), binge drinking, smoking hashish, and coffee
intake (<1 cup, 1�3 cups, >3 cups per day) in addition to covariates
in model 2. Approximately 4% of the women had missing data and
were classified according to their father’s SES. Birth weight was
obtained by linkage to the Danish Medical Birth Registry33; maternal
age was obtained by linkage to the Danish Civil Registration Sys-
tem34; maternal psychiatric history was obtained by linkage to the
DPCR and LPR; and the remaining variables were extracted from
DNBC interview data.
After identifying the association between maternal smoking and
phenotype, we examined additional models. First, to fully explore
the specific role of maternal smoking, we adjusted for the effect of
partner smoking (model 4). Because of the potential involvement of
gestational age (<37, 37�40, and >40 weeks) and birth weight
(<2,500, 2,500�3,999, and �4,000 g) in the causal pathway, we
adjusted for these variables both as continuous and categorical
variables (models 5 and 6).
Finally, we carried out post hoc exploratory analyses and
grouped families into 4 categories related to prenatal parental
smoking (maternal only, partner only, both maternal and partner,
and neither maternal nor partner).
In follow-up analyses, we used logistic regression to predict a
propensity score (PS) for smoking as the dependent variable and
then adjusted for the PS as a continuous and as a categorical variable
(consisting of quartiles) in the Cox model. The covariates included in
the PS analysis were sex of the child, birth weight, gestational
age, maternal prepregnancy body mass index (BMI), parity, birth
year, maternal age, maternal psychiatric history, parental smoking
status, SES, alcohol consumption (beer, wine, or spirits), binge
drinking, smoking hashish, and caffeine (cola and coffee) intake.
Only cases with all available covariate data were included in the
analyses. Because a few (6.2%) mothers contributed �2 children to
the birth cohort, we used cluster-adjusted standard errors to calcu-
late the 95% CIs. A two-tailed p value of < .05 was considered
statistically significant. Statistical analyses were performed using
STATA 14.1 software (StataCorp, College Station, TX).
RESULTS
Cohort Characteristics
There were 90,977 pregnancies with data on smoking,
yielding 92,765 live-born children, 89,189 of whom were
singleton births and the focus of the current study. Of the
children, 49% (n ¼ 43,521) were female. The median
duration of follow-up was 13 years. By October 2013, a total
of 906 children (1.0%) were diagnosed with the outcomes of
interest: 667 children with a TS/CT spectrum diagnosis
(531 with TS/CT) and, because of the young age of the

 cohort, a smaller number (n ¼ 294) with an OCD spectrum
diagnosis (209 with OCD) (see Tables S1 and S2, available
online). Prenatal maternal smoking was present during
26% of all pregnancies (n ¼ 24,045), 33% of pregnancies
with a child with TS/CT (n ¼ 175), and 34% of pregnancies
with a child with TS/CT spectrum (n ¼ 227). Maternal
heavy smoking was present in nearly 8% of all pregnancies
(n ¼ 6,836) and 12% of pregnancies with children with TS/
CT (n ¼ 65) and TS/CT spectrum (n ¼ 84). Approximately
82% of all pregnancies with live-born children (n ¼ 73,073)
had complete data on covariates of interest. The distribu-
tion of variables based on smoking status is presented in
Table S3, available online. The percentages of pregnancies
with prenatal maternal smoking (26%, n ¼ 19,179) or
offspring with an outcome of interest (1.0%, n ¼ 736)
remained unchanged after exclusion of pregnancies with
missing covariate data.
Effect of Prenatal Maternal Smoking on Risk for TS/CT and
OCD. Prenatal maternal
smoking was associated
with
increased IR for TS/CT (0.42 [95% CI ¼ 0.38�0.47] versus
0.54 [95% CI ¼ 0.46�0.64] for no smoking and smoking,
respectively) and TS/CT spectrum (0.53 [95% CI ¼ 0.48�0.59]
versus 0.70 [95% CI ¼ 0.61�0.82]) (Figure 1A). Furthermore,
light
smoking
was
associated
with
an
IR
of
0.46
(95% CI¼ 0.37�0.58)for TS/CT and 0.60(95% CI ¼ 0.49�0.73)
for TS/CT spectrum, whereas heavy smoking was associa-
ted with an IR of 0.76 (95% CI ¼ 0.58�1.00) for TS/CT and
0.97 (95% CI ¼ 0.76�1.24) for TS/CT spectrum (Figure 1B).
The IR for OCD was 0.17 (95% CI ¼ 014�0.20) versus 0.19
(95% CI ¼ 0.14�0.25) for no smoking versus smoking,
respectively, and the IR for OCD spectrum was 0.24
(95% CI ¼ 0.21�0.28) versus 0.28 (95% CI ¼ 0.23�0.36) for no
smoking versus smoking, respectively (see Figure S1, avail-
able online). Combining all cases of TS/CT and OCD or TS/
CT spectrum and OCD spectrum showed similar patterns as
each alone (Figure 1). Sensitivity analyses did not alter the
results (see Table S4, available online).
Our primary analysis was based on model 3 (adjusting
for birth year, sex, maternal age, parity, maternal psychiatric
disorders, SES, consumption of beer, wine, spirits, and cof-
fee, binge drinking, and consumption of hashish) (Table 1).
Based on this model, heavy smoking was significantly
associated with an approximately 65% higher risk for TS/CT
(aHR ¼ 1.69, 95% CI ¼ 1.19�2.39) and TS/CT spectrum
(aHR ¼ 1.69, 95% CI ¼ 1.25�2.29). Analysis of light smoking
in TS/CT found an aHR of 1.02 (95% CI ¼ 0.78�1.33) and an
aHR of 1.05 (95% CI ¼ 0.83�1.33) for TS/CT spectrum.
Analyses combining cases of TS/CT and OCD produced
results that were similar to those for TS/CT alone, and an-
alyses under additional models (models 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6) also
produced similar results. In adjusted analyses under all
models, prenatal maternal smoking did not show a signifi-
cant effect on risk for OCD, whether categorized as a
dichotomous variable or stratified by light versus heavy
smoking (see Table S5, available online), although the trends
were similar when comparing TS/CT and OCD.
Effect of Prenatal Maternal Smoking on Risk for TS/CT With
Comorbidities. In previous studies, maternal smoking has
been associated with TS/CT and comorbid ADHD. In our
cohort, 36% of children with TS/CT had comorbid ADHD,
and prenatal maternal smoking was associated with an
increased IR for TS/CT with comorbid ADHD (0.13, 95%
CI ¼ 0.11�0.16 for nonsmokers versus 0.21, 95% CI ¼
0.16�0.28 for smokers) (Figure 2). In adjusted analyses un-
der model 3, heavy prenatal maternal smoking was associ-
ated with a 2-fold increased risk for TS/CT with comorbid
ADHD (aHR ¼ 1.94, 95% CI ¼ 1.14�3.29), whereas an
analysis of risk for TS/CT and comorbid ADHD in children
whose mothers were light smokers found an aHR of 0.95
(95% CI ¼ 0.60�1.50) (Table 2). To determine whether pre-
natal maternal smoking increased risk for TS/CT with any
psychiatric comorbidity, we focused on the 30% of in-
dividuals who did not have ADHD but had a non-ADHD
comorbid psychiatric diagnosis. We observed that prenatal

 maternal smoking increased risk for TS/CT with any non-
ADHD psychiatric comorbidity, with an IR of 0.20 (95%
CI ¼ 0.15�0.26) in the presence of prenatal maternal
smoking, compared to an IR of 0.11 (95% CI ¼ 0.09�0.14) in
the absence of prenatal maternal smoking. Adjusted ana-
lyses demonstrated that both light smoking (aHR ¼ 1.81,
95% CI ¼ 1.16�2.80) and heavy smoking (aHR ¼ 2.50, 95%
CI ¼ 1.30�4.83) increased risk for TS/CT with any non-
ADHD
psychiatric
comorbidity.
Similar
findings
were
observed under all models.
PS-adjusted analysis (using either continuous or cate-
gorical PS) yielded results similar to those of the above
models, although the aHR for the association between heavy
smoking and TS/CT with any non-ADHD psychiatric
comorbidity was as high as 3.70 to 4.25 (see Tables S5 and
S6, available online).
DISCUSSION
The DNBC is a unique and powerful resource for relating
maternal factors with subsequent medical and health out-
comes. The prospectively collected quantitative data in the
DNBC have shown a relation between prenatal maternal
smoking and ADHD,21 low birth weight,35 and childhood
obesity.36 In our study, heavy maternal prenatal smoking
was associated with an increased risk for TS/CT (and tic
disorders more broadly) in the offspring, with a strong as-
sociation with complex presentations of TS/CT, that is, TS/
CT with comorbid psychiatric diagnosis. Importantly, both
multivariable and PS-adjusted Cox models showed that the
observed associations could not be attributed to many po-
tential confounders such as SES, maternal psychiatric his-
tory, maternal use of alcohol, caffeine, or hashish during
pregnancy, or partner smoking. Maternal light smoking was
not associated with an increased risk for TS/CT in the
offspring, consistent with a dose-dependent relationship
between exposure and risk.
To further investigate whether maternal or partner smok-
ing has differential effects on risk, in exploratory analyses (see
Table S7, available online), cohort families were divided into 4
groups based on whether maternal (M) smoking or partner (P)
smoking was present (þ) or absent (�). This resulted in
smaller groups and thus reduced power; however, the point
estimates for risk were higher (1.3) for MþP� families
compared with M-Pþ families (1.0), suggesting an important
and unique role for maternal smoking in risk for TS/CT and
related disorders. A previous DNBC study associated ADHD
and
both
maternal
and
paternal
prenatal
smoking.21
Although exploratory, our results for TS/CT with comorbid
ADHD are consistent with those results.
Significantly, although prenatal maternal smoking has
been linked to low birth weight and preterm birth,35,37,38 our
adjusted analyses indicate that the association between
prenatal maternal smoking and TS/CT is unlikely to be
mediated by the effect of smoking on birth weight or
gestational age and appears to have a more direct role in
increasing TS/CT risk.
We observed similar trends with pediatric-onset OCD
compared to TS/CT; however, the smaller number of OCD
cases resulted in lower power to determine significant
findings. As pediatric-onset and adult-onset OCD may have
different pathophysiology, symptomatology, and course,39
examining maternal smoking and both pediatric-onset
and adult-onset OCD risk in larger cohorts would be of

Our study extends previous research in 2 important
ways. First, our study is the largest to date to investigate
the association between prenatal maternal smoking and
childhood risk for TS/CT and OCD, and to suggest a
dose�response relationship in the association of prenatal
maternal smoking with tic disorders. Our finding that heavy
maternal smoking is associated with elevated TS/CT risk
contrasts with a previous population-based study (based on

 122 TS/CT cases, using maternal self-report questionnaires)
that found no step-wise association between smoking
dosage and TS/CT risk,26 and a previous registry-based
study that found no association between prenatal maternal
smoking and TS,16 although smoking behavior was not
stratified by quantity smoked.
Second, our study confirms previous work that prenatal
maternal smoking (particularly heavy smoking) increases
risk for TS with comorbid ADHD.13,16,24,27 Importantly,
however, we show that the risk relationship is not limited to
ADHD but, rather, that prenatal maternal smoking increases
risk for complex presentations of TS/CT (TS/CT plus any
comorbid psychiatric disorder).
Interestingly, recent studies with a genetically sensitive
design suggest
that
the
association
between maternal
smoking and some neuropsychiatric disorders (e.g., ADHD
and ASD) might reflect shared risk mechanisms rather than
a causal relationship.40,41 It is possible that the observed
association between maternal smoking and complex TS/CT
represents, at least partially, a shared inheritance. Although
we and others adjust for confounding effects of maternal
psychiatric disorders, risk for residual and/or unrecognized
effects cannot be ruled out.42
Several mechanisms might explain a possible direct asso-
ciation between prenatal maternal smoking and higher risk
for TS/CT, both with and without comorbid psychiatric di-
agnoses. Prenatal nicotine exposure affects several aspects of
fetal brain maturation, including neuronal migration, prolif-
eration, and differentiation.43 Exposure of the fetal brain to
nicotine alters the development of multiple neurotransmitter
systems including dopamine, the most consistently altered
neurotransmitter in studies of TS/CT.44,45 In addition, pre-
natal exposure to smoking might cause subtle structural
changes in the striatum, thalamus, thalamocortical fibers, and
cortex.46-48 Abnormalities in these brain circuits have been
implicated in the pathophysiology of TS/CT and its common
comorbidities, including OCD, ADHD, and ASD.45,49-54 Im-
mune dysregulation, which has also been linked to risk for
TS/CT, may be another mechanism through which maternal
smoking affects fetal brain development.18,19,55
Key strengths of our birth cohort study include detailed
prospective data collection and large sample size. We were
able to consider the effect of smoking dosage, as well as
important potential confounders, on risk for illness in a
robustly designed study.
Our study also has several limitations. First, exposure
was determined using maternal self-report, albeit in a pro-
spective
and
contemporaneous
interview
format
(and
responses to smoking-related questions were rated as
highly trustworthy). Recent molecular analyses of neonatal
blood spots provide strong support for the validity of
maternal self-report of smoking (J. Mill, Buxbaum, Schendel,
Parner, and Reichenberg, unpublished, 2016). Regarding
diagnostic outcomes used in this study, the Danish Psychi-
atric Central Register and the Danish National Hospital
Register include health care�seeking individuals and may
not capture those with milder presentations.
Second, although we adjusted for many confounding
factors, we did not have access to paternal psychiatric his-
tory through the DNBC, a factor that could affect our ana-
lyses; however, a previous study has shown that paternal
psychiatric history is unlikely to affect the association be-
tween maternal smoking and TS/CT.16 In addition, although
we were able to adjust for low birth weight and preterm
birth, we could not adjust for other birth complications that
have been previously suggested to be associated with
maternal smoking as well as with risk for TS/CT.15,26
Similarly,
less
severe
maternal
psychiatric
disorders
(including milder mood and anxiety disorders) may go un-
recorded in some cases.
Third, although we had an 18% rate for missing data,
distribution of exposures and outcomes did not change after
exclusion of missing data, and thus they appear unlikely to
threaten the external validity of our study.
Finally, it is important to note that diagnoses of TS/CT
and OCD have yet to be fully validated in Danish regis-
tries, although the validity of tic disorders and OCD in
similar systems, such as the Swedish national registries, is
strong.56
In conclusion, our results show that heavy prenatal
maternal smoking is associated with elevated risk for TS/CT
as well as for TS/CT with comorbid psychiatric disorders.
These findings may point to a biological pathway that links
prenatal tobacco exposure and altered brain development.
This possibility can be further investigated in epidemiolog-
ical studies that simultaneously address the roles of genetic
background, social environment, and in utero tobacco
exposure. &
