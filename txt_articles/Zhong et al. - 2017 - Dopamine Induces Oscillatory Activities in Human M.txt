SUMMARY
Locomotor symptoms in Parkinson’s disease (PD)
are accompanied by widespread oscillatory neuronal
activities in basal ganglia. Here, we show that activa-
tion of dopamine D1-class receptors elicits a large
rhythmic bursting of spontaneous excitatory post-
synaptic currents (sEPSCs) in midbrain neurons
differentiated from induced pluripotent stem cells
(iPSCs) of PD patients with parkin mutations, but
not normal subjects. Overexpression of wild-type
parkin, but not its PD-causing mutant, abolishes
the oscillatory activities in patient neurons. Dopa-
mine induces a delayed enhancement in the ampli-
tude of spontaneous, but not miniature, EPSCs,
thus increasing quantal content. The results suggest
that presynaptic regulation of glutamatergic trans-
mission by dopamine D1-class receptors is signifi-
cantly potentiated by parkin mutations. The aberrant
dopaminergic regulation of presynaptic glutamater-
gic transmission in patient-specific iPSC-derived
midbrain neurons provides a mechanistic clue to
PD pathophysiology, and it demonstrates the useful-
ness of this model system in understanding how
mutations of parkin cause movement symptoms in
Parkinson’s disease.
INTRODUCTION
Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a movement disorder characterized
by the loss of nigral dopaminergic (DA) neurons. Its defining loco-
motor symptoms, tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia, and postural
instability, are caused by the degeneration of nigral DA neurons
and the ensuing dysfunction of basal ganglia motor circuits
(Lang and Lozano, 1998). Glutamatergic inputs from motor
cortex are processed by the basal ganglia motor circuits, whose
output is relayed through thalamus to motor cortex to enable
voluntary motor activities (Wichmann et al., 2011). DA input to
all parts of basal ganglia, particularly to striatum, is essential to
the processing of cortical glutamatergic inputs. In PD, dimin-
ished DA inputs to striatum due to the loss of nigrostriatal DA
neurons disrupt the balanced actions of dopamine on striatal
neurons (Obeso et al., 2010). Thus, understanding the impact
of dopamine on glutamatergic neurotransmission would reveal
significant insights into the mechanisms of PD.
The complexity of idiopathic PD makes it necessary to analyze
how mutations of single genes cause PD. Among the PD-linked
genes, parkin (Kitada et al., 1998), which encodes for a protein-
ubiquitin ligase (Shimura et al., 2000), is most frequently mutated
in recessively inherited PD (Hardy, 2010). Unlike LRRK2 muta-
tions, which are dominant, more frequent, but have incomplete
penetrance and a strong founder effect (Paisa
´ n-Ruiz et al.,
2013), parkin mutations are fully penetrant and independently
arisen in diverse genetic backgrounds (Nuytemans et al.,
2010). The excellent human genetics data on parkin (Nuytemans
et al., 2010) and the absence of robust PD phenotypes in parkin
knockout mice (Perez and Palmiter, 2005) and rats (Dave et al.,
2014) have led us to generate induced pluripotent stem cells
(iPSCs) from PD patients with parkin mutations to study the path-
ogenic mechanism of PD caused by parkin mutations (Jiang
et al., 2012). Using iPSC-derived midbrain DA neurons, we found
that parkin mutations increased the spontaneous release of
dopamine (Jiang et al., 2012). Consistent with this, many previ-
ous studies linked parkin to synaptic vesicles. Parkin monoubi-
quitinates synaptic vesicle proteins endophilin A, synaptojanin
1, and dynamin (Trempe et al., 2009; Cao et al., 2014), as well
as proteins involved in vesicle recycling, such as CASK (Fallon
et al., 2002), PICK1 (Joch et al., 2007), and Eps15 (Fallon et al.,
2006). It polyubiquitinates synaptic vesicle proteins CDCrel-1
(Zhang et al., 2000) and synaptotagmin XI (Huynh et al., 2003).
In the present study, we found that dopamine induced a de-
layed increase in the amplitude of spontaneous excitatory post-
synaptic currents (sEPSCs) in iPSC-derived midbrain neurons
from PD patients with parkin mutations, but not from normal sub-
jects. It was accompanied by a significant increase in quantal
content in response to dopamine, as miniature EPSCs were
very similar between normal and patient neurons, irrespective
of dopamine treatment. This modest action of dopamine
became very striking with the concomitant inhibition of dopa-
mine D2-class receptors or selective activation of dopamine
D1-class receptors alone, either of which elicited a large rhyth-
mic bursting of sEPSCs in neurons from parkin patients, but
not from normal subjects. The phenotype was rescued by

 overexpression of wild-type parkin, but not its PD-causing
mutant. The rhythmic bursting of sEPSCs in parkin-deficient
neurons is reminiscent of the oscillatory neuronal activities
seen in basal ganglia of PD patients and animal models of
PD (Galvan and Wichmann, 2008), but it differs from the in vivo
observations in its frequency and how dopamine impacts on
the oscillation (Brittain and Brown, 2014). Our results suggest
that presynaptic glutamatergic transmission is strongly potenti-
ated by D1-class dopamine receptors when parkin is mutated.
The patient-specific iPSC-derived midbrain DA neurons provide
a novel platform to study the molecular mechanism of the
abnormal rhythmic bursting of neuronal activities in basal
ganglia, which has long been associated with movement symp-
toms of PD.
RESULTS
Differentiation of Patient-Specific iPSCs to Midbrain
Neurons
We differentiated iPSCs from three PD patients with different
parkin mutations and three normal subjects (see Table S1 for
information on the six subjects) to midbrain DA neurons using
an improved rosette-based protocol (Jiang et al., 2012). These
iPSCs (Figure 1A) were first differentiated to embryoid bodies
(EBs) (Figure 1B), which were differentiated to neuroepithelial
cells resembling a cross section of the neural tube (Figure 1C).
Cells from the rosettes were cultured in suspension to form
neurospheres, which were dissociated for further differentiation
to neurons (Figure 1D). When we stained the iPSC-derived neu-
rons for various markers, it was clear that the neuronal culture
contained a mixed population of GABAergic neurons (35.6% ±
4.7% of DAPI+ cells) (Figures 1E–1G), glutamatergic neurons
(33.8% ± 4.0% of DAPI+ cells) (Figures 1H–1J), and DA neurons
(30.5% ± 2.5% of DAPI+ cells) (Figures 1E–1J). Almost all DAPI+
cells were neurons; 23.5% ± 5.8% of the neurons in the cul-
ture expressed D1 dopamine receptors (Figures 1K–1M), while
18.2% ± 5.1% expressed D2 dopamine receptors (Figures
1N–1P). Of TH+ neurons, 72.2% ± 8.5% coexpressed the
midbrain marker FoxA2 (Figures 1Q–1S), corroborating with
our previous finding that TH+ neurons generated with this
differentiation protocol are mainly midbrain DA neurons (Jiang
et al., 2012).
Dopamine Induces a Delayed Increase of sEPSC in
Midbrain Neurons from Parkin Patients
We examined the effect of dopamine on sEPSCs in mature iPSC-
derived neurons that were cultured for at least 100 days since the
start of differentiation, as our previous study showed that elec-
trophysiological properties of iPSC-derived neurons mature
over time (Jiang et al., 2012). Neurons from different patients ex-
hibited similar responses and were thus grouped together. The
same was true for neurons from different normal subjects. The
number of neurons recorded for each figure is listed in Table
S2, which shows a generally even distribution of recorded neu-
rons among different subjects. These small numbers mask the
large number of neurons that we had to record in order to obtain
a successful trace that lasted 20–30 min for us to fully document
oscillatory activities. For each one neuron reported in Table S2,
we had to try about five coverslips, recording six to seven neu-
rons on each coverslip. Thus, of �30 neurons recorded, we ob-
tained one recording that lasted 20–30 min. Since oscillatory
neuronal activities in PD patients are widespread in many types
of neurons, not limited to DA neurons (Wichmann and Dostrov-
sky, 2011), our electrophysiological recording was performed
on all types of neurons in the culture. Variations in sEPSCs
among individual neurons were reflected in error bars, which
were quite small and suggest fairly uniform behaviors in different
types of neurons. A saturating concentration (100 mM) of dopa-
mine was used to fully activate all dopamine receptors, as
described in previous papers (Otani et al., 1999; Andre
´ et al.,
2011; Shen and Johnson, 2012).
In iPSC-derived midbrain neurons from parkin patients, the
application of dopamine induced an initial decrease (21.7% ±
1.8%; n = 7; p < 0.05, Kolmogorov-Smirnov [K-S] test) of sEPSC
amplitude (Figure 2A, phase 1), which was followed by a signifi-
cant increase (36.7% ± 2.4%; n = 7; p < 0.05, K-S test) (Figure 2A,
phase 2). However, in iPSC-derived neurons from normal sub-
jects, dopamine only caused a transient reduction (23.8% ±
1.5%; n = 6; p < 0.05, K-S test) of sEPSC amplitude in phase 1,
without the delayed increase in phase 2 (5.8% ± 0.8%; n = 6;
p > 0.05, K-S test; patient group and normal group comparison:
Kruskal-Wallis [K-W] test: 8.9, p = 0.0027) (Figure 2A). For the
sEPSC frequency, dopamine induced a delayed increase in
iPSC-derived midbrain neurons in both patient and control
groups only in phase 2 (parkin patients: 37.2% ± 2.7%; n = 7;
p < 0.05, K-S test; normal subjects: 30.8% ± 4.7%; n = 6;
p < 0.05, K-S, test; two groups comparison: p > 0.05, K-W test)
(Figure 2B). Representative sEPSC recordings in neurons derived
from PD patients with parkin mutations (Figure 2C) and normal
subjects (Figure 2D) illustrate the delayed increase of sEPSC
amplitude in phase 2 only in neurons from parkin patients.
The sEPSCs were recorded in the absence of GABAA recep-
tor antagonist. The addition of 6,7-dinitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione
(DNQX) (50 mM), which blocks non-NMDA ionic glutamate recep-
tors, abolished sEPSCs in neurons from parkin patients (Fig-
ure 2E) and normal subjects (Figure 2F). We also examined the
effect of dopamine on miniature EPSCs (mEPSCs) by using
tetrodotoxin (TTX) (1 mM) to block spontaneous neuronal activ-
ities. Subsequent treatment of dopamine (100 mM) had no
significant effect on mEPSCs in neurons from parkin patients
(Figure 2G) or normal subjects (Figure 2H). There was no signif-
icant change in the amplitude (Figure 2I) and frequency (Fig-
ure 2J) of mEPSCs. These results suggest that the effects of
dopamine on sEPSCs are mediated by a presynaptic mecha-
nism, not through a postsynaptic mechanism, which would
affect mEPSCs. Quantal content, which represents the number
of vesicles released in response to a presynaptic stimulus and
can be calculated by dividing the sEPSC amplitude by the
mEPSC amplitude, was significantly increased by dopamine in
iPSC-derived neurons from parkin patients (1.69 ± 0.05, n = 5)
compared to normal subjects (1.17 ± 0.04, n = 6) (p < 0.001,
Student’s t test). There was no significant difference between
patient neurons (1.12 ± 0.02, n = 5) and control neurons (1.13 ±
0.03, n = 6) in quantal content in the absence of dopamine treat-
ment (p > 0.05, Student’s t test) (Figure 2K). When TTX was
added to block sEPSCs (Figures S1A and S1B), there was no

 significant change in the EPSC amplitude (Figure S1C; p > 0.05,
K-S test), but there was a significant and marked reduction in the
EPSC frequency (Figure S1D; p < 0.0001, K-S test), showing that
spontaneous activities were indeed blocked by TTX so we could
study mEPSCs. In response to DA treatment, the sEPSC ampli-
tude was not significantly changed in normal neurons, but it was
significantly increased in neurons from parkin patients (Fig-
ure S1E; p < 0.05, K-W test). This is reflected in Figure 2A,
comparing phase 2 and baseline. In response to DA treatment,
the sEPSC frequency was significantly increased in neurons
from normal subjects and parkin patients (p < 0.05, K-W test),
but to similar degrees (Figure S1F). This is reflected in Figure 2B,
comparing phase 2 and baseline.
The Delayed Increase of sEPSC Amplitude in Parkin
Patients Depends on Dopamine D1 Receptors
To confirm that the effects are dependent on dopamine recep-
tors, we co-applied dopamine (100 mM) with D1-class antagonist

SCH23390 (10 mM) and D2-class antago-
nist sulpiride (20 mM). These antagonists
completely blocked all the effects of dopa-
mine on sEPSC amplitude (Figure 3A) and
frequency (Figure 3B) in iPSC-derived neu-
rons from both groups (parkin patients,
n = 5; normal subjects, n = 5). Representa-
tive sEPSC traces for neurons derived
from PD patients with parkin mutations
(Figure 3C) and normal subjects (Figure 3D)
are shown.
Next, we performed experiments to
determine which dopamine receptors are
responsible for the differential effects of dopamine on sEPSCs
in neurons from parkin patients and normal subjects. As shown
in Figure 4A, when D1-class receptors were blocked by
SCH23390 (10 mM), the initial reducing effect of dopamine
(100 mM) on sEPSC amplitude was intact in iPSC-derived neu-
rons from both groups (parkin patients: 24.5% ± 1.6%; n = 6;
p < 0.05, K-S test; normal subjects: 23.6% ± 1.9%; n = 6;
p < 0.05, K-S test; two groups comparison: p > 0.05, K-W
test), suggesting that the reducing effect is not mediated by
D1-class dopamine receptors. In the presence of SCH23390,
the delayed enhancing effect of dopamine on sEPSC amplitude
in parkin patients was eliminated (�3.1% ± 1.1%; n = 6;
p > 0.05, K-S test), suggesting that the enhancing effect
is mediated by D1-class dopamine receptors. As shown in
Figure 4B, the dopamine-induced increase in the sEPSC
frequency in both groups was blocked by SCH23390 (parkin
patients: �4.3% ± 0.6%, n = 6; normal subjects: �3.5% ±
1.1%, n = 6; p > 0.05, K-S test), suggesting mediation by

 D1-class receptors. Representative sEPSC traces for neurons
derived from PD patients with parkin mutations (Figure 4C)
and normal subjects (Figure 4D) show that the differential effect
of dopamine on the delayed increase of sEPSC amplitude
in neurons from parkin patients versus normal subjects was
dependent on D1-class dopamine receptors.
Activation of D1 Receptors Induces Oscillatory sEPSC in
Midbrain Neurons from Parkin Patients
Since D1-class and D2-class dopamine receptors often exert
opposing effects (Gerfen and Surmeier, 2011), we blocked
D2-class receptors with sulpiride (20 mM) to isolate the action of
D1-class receptors (Figure 5). Under this condition, dopamine
(100 mM) no longer induced the initial reduction of sEPSC ampli-
tude. Surprisingly, it induced a remarkable rhythmic bursting
of sEPSCs in iPSC-derived neurons from parkin patients. The
bursting oscillation frequency was 1.1 ± 0.1 events/min (n = 8),
and each burst lasted for 20.5 ± 1.9 s (n = 8). During the bursting,
sEPSC amplitude was increased by 36.2% ± 2.6% (n = 8;
p < 0.05, K-S test) (Figures 5A and 5C) and sEPSC frequency
was increased by 1,703% ± 103% (n = 8; p < 0.005, K-S test) (Fig-
ures 5B and 5C). Between bursting, sEPSC amplitude was not
significantly changed (Figures 5A and 5C), while sEPSC fre-
quency was increased by 168.6% ± 9.8% (n = 8; p < 0.05, K-S
test) (Figures 5B and 5C). In iPSC-derived neurons from normal
subjects, dopamine plus sulpiride did not induce rhythmic
bursting (Figures 5A, 5B, and 5D) but only a modest increase in
sEPSC frequency (35.3% ± 2.3%; n = 6; p < 0.05, K-S test)

centage change by dopamine in the presence of

increase in sEPSC amplitude (3.2% ±
0.5%; n = 6; p > 0.05, K-S test) (Figures
5A and 5D).
To confirm that D1-class dopamine
receptors mediated the rhythmic bursting
of sEPSCs in iPSC-derived neurons from
parkin patients, we applied the D1-class
agonist SKF81297 (20 mM). As shown in
Figure 6, application of SKF81297 also
induced rhythmic bursting of sEPSCs in
neurons from PD patients with parkin mu-
tations. The rhythmic bursting frequency
was 0.8 ± 0.1 events/min (n = 6), and
each burst lasted 17.2 ± 1.7 s (n = 6)
(Figures 6B and 6C). During bursting, sEPSC amplitude was
increased by 33.2% ± 2.4% (n = 6; p < 0.05, K-S test) (Figures
6A and 6C), and sEPSC frequency was increased by 1,442% ±
137% (n = 6; p < 0.005, K-S test) (Figures 6B and 6C). Between
the bursting, sEPSC amplitude was not significantly changed
(Figures 6A and 6C), and sEPSC frequency was increased
by 147.3% ± 9.2% (n = 6; p < 0.05, K-S test) (Figures 6B
and 6C). In iPSC-derived neurons from normal subjects,
SKF81297 did not induce rhythmic bursting (Figure 6D); it
only increased sEPSC frequency modestly (31.8% ± 4.6%;
n = 5; p < 0.05, K-S test) (Figures 6B and 6D), and it did not
have any significant effect on sEPSC amplitude (5.1% ±
0.8%; n = 5; p > 0.05, K-S test) (Figures 6A and 6D).
Oscillatory sEPSCs in Neurons from Parkin Patients Are
Rescued by Overexpression of Parkin
To demonstrate that the oscillatory sEPSCs were caused by
parkin mutations, we infected P002 neurons with lentiviruses
expressing wild-type parkin (Jiang et al., 2012). Activation of
dopamine D1-class receptors by dopamine (100 mM) and sulpir-
ide (20 mM) produced no rhythmic bursting of sEPSCs (n = 10)
(Figures 7A–7C). There was no significant increase in sEPSC
amplitude (6.8% ± 0.4%; n = 10; p > 0.05, K-S test) (Figure 7A),
but there was a significant increase in sEPSC frequency
(122.6% ± 11.7%; n = 10; p < 0.05, K-S test) (Figure 7B). In
contrast, P002 neurons transduced with lentivirus expressing
the PD-causing T240R mutant parkin (Jiang et al., 2012) ex-
hibited strong rhythmic bursting of sEPSCs (Figures 7A, 7B,
1038
Cell Reports 19, 1033–1044, May 2, 2017
 and 7D). Oscillation frequency for the bursts was 0.81 ± 0.17
events/min (n = 8), and bursts lasted on average for 17.9 ±
1.3 s (n = 8). During bursting, sEPSC amplitude was increased
by 25.7% ± 2.1% (n = 8; p < 0.05, K-S test) (Figure 7A), and
sEPSC frequency was increased by 1,338% ± 78% (n = 8;
p < 0.005, K-S test) (Figure 7B). Between bursts, sEPSC ampli-
tude was not significantly increased (10.9% ± 0.7%; n = 8;
p > 0.05, K-S test) (Figure 7A), and sEPSC frequency was
increased by 95.6% ± 6.1% (n = 8; p < 0.05, K-S test) (Fig-
ure 7B). Similarly, P002 neurons transduced with GFP lentivirus
(Jiang et al., 2012) also showed robust rhythmic bursting of
sEPSCs (Figures 7A, 7B, and 7E). Bursting oscillation frequency
was 0.68 ± 0.14 events/min (n = 6), and the average duration
was 15.1 ± 1.2 s (n = 6). During bursting, sEPSC amplitude
was increased by 28.3% ± 2.4% (n = 6; p < 0.05, K-S test) (Fig-
ure 7A), and sEPSC frequency was increased by 1,402% ± 93%
(n = 6; p < 0.005, K-S test) (Figure 7B). Between bursts, sEPSC
amplitude was not significantly increased (6.1% ± 0.4%; n = 6;
p > 0.05, K-S test) (Figure 7A), and sEPSC frequency was
increased by 87.8% ± 6.8% (n = 6; p < 0.05, K-S test) (Fig-
ure 7B). Thus, wild-type parkin, but not its PD-linked T240R
mutant or an irrelevant protein (GFP), rescued the oscillatory
neuronal activities caused by parkin mutations.

DISCUSSION
PD is clinically defined by a core set of
movement symptoms that are caused by
the dysfunctional basal ganglia neural
network consequent of a severe loss of
nigral DA neurons. It remains unclear
why diminished DA input to striatum
leads to movement abnormalities in PD.
The discovery of iPSCs (Takahashi and
Yamanaka, 2006) makes it possible to
generate patient-specific midbrain neu-
rons to study PD (Pu et al., 2012). Our pre-
vious study using iPSC-derived midbrain
DA neurons from normal subjects and
PD patients with parkin mutations has
shown that parkin controls the precision
of DA transmission by limiting sponta-
neous DA release and enhancing DA re-
uptake (Jiang et al., 2012). In the present
study, we used the same set of patient-
derived midbrain neurons to study whether the regulation of
glutamatergic transmission by dopamine is affected in PD, as
neurons in the basal ganglia network receive glutamatergic input
from cortex and subthalamic nucleus (STN), as well as DA input
from substantia nigra pars compacta (Albin et al., 1989). The
balanced modulatory actions of dopamine on glutamatergic in-
puts on medium spiny neurons (MSNs) in the striatum, through
D1-class and D2-class receptors that are expressed on different
subsets of MSNs, are disrupted in PD (DeLong, 1990; Gerfen and
Surmeier, 2011). Thus, understanding whether PD-linked mono-
genic mutations, such as those of parkin, affect DA regulation of
glutamatergic transmission may reveal the molecular underpin-
ning of PD.
The most significant result of our study is that activation of D1-
class dopamine receptors, either by co-application of dopamine
with the D2-class receptor antagonist sulpiride (Figure 5) or
application of the D1-class receptor agonist SKF81297 alone
(Figure 6), induced large rhythmic bursting of sEPSCs in iPSC-
derived midbrain neurons from PD patients with parkin muta-
tions, but not from normal subjects. The rhythmic bursting of
sEPSCs is reminiscent of oscillatory activities in basal ganglia
neurons in PD patients (Wichmann and Dostrovsky, 2011).
Recording of local field potentials in PD patients undergoing

 surgeries, such as deep brain stimulation, shows that many parts
of basal ganglia, such as striatum, globus pallidus internal
segment (GPi), and STN, exhibit oscillatory activities (Wichmann
and Dostrovsky, 2011). L-DOPA administration disrupts the
oscillatory activities in PD patients (Brown and Williams,
2005). Oscillation of neuronal activities is also seen in STN,
globus pallidus external segment (GPe), and GPi of 1-methyl-
4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine
(MPTP)-treated
monkey
models of PD (Wichmann et al., 2011). In contrast, activities of
STN and GPe in normal humans and monkeys do not have any
rhythm or obvious pattern (Wilson and Bevan, 2011). Although
it is unclear why basal ganglia neurons in the parkinsonian state
have synchronized, rhythmic bursting activities, it is remarkable
that iPSC-derived midbrain neurons from PD patients with parkin
mutations exhibit oscillatory sEPSCs in vitro. The absence of
oscillatory activities in iPSC-derived midbrain neurons from
normal subjects corroborates that the rhythmic bursting of
sEPSCs is associated with PD. The ability of wild-type parkin,
but not its PD-linked T240R mutant or GFP, to rescue the oscil-
latory activities (Figure 7) indicates that parkin mutations indeed
cause the oscillation.

Consistent with the observations in PD
patients, oscillatory activities were found
to be similar in different types of neurons
in iPSC-derived midbrain neuronal cul-
tures, which contained glutamatergic,
GABAergic, and DA neurons (Figure 1).
There are, however, important differ-
ences between the oscillatory sEPSCs in
iPSC-derived neurons and the rhythmic
bursting activities in PD patients and ani-
mal PD models, which have much higher
frequencies and are attenuated by dopa-
mine (Brittain and Brown, 2014). A variety
of factors may underlie the discrepancy,
including the lack of complex synaptic
organizations in neurons differentiated
from iPSCs, maturity of the iPSC-derived
neurons (around 100 days), lack of inputs
from neurons representing other parts of
the brain, etc. Nevertheless, the random
mixture of midbrain neurons in the dish
produced oscillatory sEPSCs when par-
kin was mutated and when D1-class re-
ceptors were activated. The results suggest an intrinsic problem
in parkin-deficient neurons, as manifested in increased quantal
content in response to dopamine treatment (Figure 2K). The dif-
ferences between our observation in this artificial system in vitro
and the in vivo situation in PD patients will stimulate further
research utilizing an iPSC-based system that can better approx-
imate patient brains, such as organoids (Lancaster et al., 2013).
The strong response of parkin-deficient neurons to the activa-
tion of D1-class dopamine receptors (Figures 5 and 6) is reminis-
cent of the dopamine hypersensitivity in PD animal models (Fuxe
and Ungerstedt, 1976; Kim et al., 2000). The simultaneous acti-
vation of both D1- and D2-class receptors by dopamine only
had modest effects on sEPSCs in iPSC-derived midbrain neu-
rons from parkin patients (Figures 2, 3, and 4), suggesting that
the opposing effect of D2-class receptors may have masked
the strong effect of D1-class receptors. Interestingly, a delayed
enhancement of sEPSC amplitude, which was mediated by
D1-class receptors, was only observed in parkin patients, but
not in normal subjects (Figure 2). This is consistent with the re-
sults that only neurons derived from parkin patients exhibited
D1-induced oscillation of sEPSCs (Figures 5 and 6). The results

 suggest that the actions of dopamine on D1-class receptors are
markedly altered in PD patients with parkin mutations. Since the
initial inhibitory effect of dopamine on sEPSC amplitude (Fig-
ure 2A), which was mediated by D2-class receptors (Figure 4A),
was similar in iPSC-derived neurons from normal subjects and
parkin patients, it suggests that the impact of dopamine on D2
receptors appears to be largely unaffected by parkin mutations.
It is widely recognized that an overactive indirect pathway
emanated from striatal MSNs expressing D2-class receptors
may underlie PD motor symptoms (DeLong, 1990) and the oscil-
latory activities in vivo (Brittain and Brown, 2014). Further studies
are needed to understand why mutations of parkin render human
midbrain neurons much more sensitive to dopamine D1 receptor
activation and why the increased sensitivity manifests in rhyth-
mic bursting of sEPSCs.
Here we propose a working model (Figure 7F) based on the
current study, our earlier finding on increased spontaneous
dopamine release in DA neurons from PD patients with parkin
mutations (Jiang et al., 2012), and previous studies linking parkin
to synaptic vesicles (Trempe et al., 2009; Cao et al., 2014; Huynh
et al., 2003; Zhang et al., 2000). In normal neurons, parkin may
regulate the function of synaptic vesicles through proteins,
such as endophilin A, synaptojanin 1, and dynamin (Trempe
et al., 2009; Cao et al., 2014). The lack of this regulation in patient
neurons elevates spontaneous DA release (Jiang et al., 2012).
The action of dopamine is balanced by D1-class and D2-class
receptors. When D2-class receptors were inhibited (Figure 5)
or when only D1-class receptors were activated (Figure 6), pro-
tein kinase A (PKA) in presynaptic glutamatergic neurons was
strongly activated to speed up the recycling of synaptic vesicles
(Greengard, 2001). This may synergize with the concomitant
increase in the quantal content of sEPSCs (Figure 2K) and cause
huge increases in sEPSCs, which are periodically attenuated by
temporary exhaustion of recycling vesicles. Thus, we observed
oscillation of sEPSCs in parkin-deficient neurons when D1-class
receptors were activated.
Our results have demonstrated the utility of patient-specific
iPSC-derived neurons in a mechanistic study of PD. This prepa-
ration exhibits oscillatory neuronal activities resembling those in
PD patients in vivo as well as in animal models of parkinsonism.
Since the iPSC-based cell model system captures the intrinsic
properties of neurons from PD patients, it would be a useful
platform to dissect the molecular mechanism underlying the
pathophysiology of PD. Understanding the differences between
iPSC-derived neurons from normal subjects and PD patients
will reveal important targets for the development of disease-
modifying therapies.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Human Subjects
Written informed consent was received from participants prior to inclusion in
the study. The study was approved by the Health Sciences Institutional Review
Board of the University at Buffalo, the State University of New York. Two
normal subjects (C001 and C002) and two PD patients with parkin mutations
(P001, who has compound heterozygous deletions of exon 3 and exon 5 of
parkin, and P002, who carries homozygous deletion of exon 3) were described
previously (Jiang et al., 2012). Another normal subject C003 and PD patient
with parkin mutations (P005) were added to the study. Skin fibroblasts from
P005 were purchased from Coriell Cell Repository (ND30171, with parkin
exon 3 deletion and R42P mutation). Details of the subjects are listed in Table
S1. All normal subjects were the unaffected spouses of idiopathic PD patients.
The different age profiles of the control and patient groups had no significant
effect on the derivation of iPSCs. There was no evidence that donor age
affected any phenotype of iPSC-derived cells.
Generation of iPSC Lines
Skin fibroblasts from normal subjects or PD patients with parkin mutations
were reprogrammed to iPSCs according to our previous publication (Jiang
et al., 2012). Briefly, 1 3 105 human skin fibroblasts were infected with human
Oct4, Sox4, Klf4, c-Myc, Nanog, and M2rtTA lentiviruses in the presence of
4 mg/mL polybrene for 1 day. The infected fibroblasts were plated on mito-
mycin C-treated mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) feeder cells in DMEM con-
taining 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 2 mM L-Glutamine, 50 U/mL penicillin,
and 50 mg/mL streptomycin for another day. Then the media were changed to
human embryonic stem cell (hESC) media (DMEM/F12 supplemented with
20% knockout serum replacement, 2 mM L-Glutamine, 0.1 mM nonessential
amino acids [NEAAs], 0.1 mM b-ME, penicillin/streptomycin, and 4 ng/mL
basic fibroblast growth factor [bFGF]) supplemented with 1 mg/mL doxycycline
and 0.5 mM valproic acid (VPA) (for 7 days). The hESC-like clones normally
appeared between day 24 and 40. Then the clones with good morphology
were picked manually, expanded on MEF in hESC media, and passaged every
5–7 days by dispase (1 mg/mL) treatment.
Differentiation of iPSCs to Midbrain Neurons
Differentiation of iPSCs was performed according to our previous paper (Jiang
et al., 2012). Briefly, iPSCs were treated with 1 mg/mL dispase to detach them
from MEF feeder cells. The iPSC clumps were grown as EBs in hESC medium
with 10 mM SB431542 for 4 days. At day 5, EBs were transferred to neural
induction media (DMEM/F12 with 1 3 N2 supplements, 0.1 mM NEAA, and
2 mg/mL heparin) containing 20 ng/mL bFGF for 2 more days. Then the EBs
were plated on Matrigel-coated six-well plates in neural induction media for
1 week. When some elongated, columnar cells appeared in the center of the
differentiated colonies, the culture media were further supplied with FGF8a
(20 ng/mL) and sonic hedgehog (SHH) (100 ng/mL) for 1 more week. Then
these rosettes were isolated manually and cultured in neural induction media
with FGF8a (50 ng/mL), SHH (100 ng/mL), B27 supplements (13), and ascor-
bic acid (200 mM) in suspension for 6 days to form neurospheres. The neuro-
spheres were digested with accutase/trypsin (1:1) into single cells. The cells
(1 3 105 cells/mL) were plated on polyornithine/laminin/Matrigel-coated
coverslips in neural differentiation medium (Neurobasal medium with 1 3 N2
supplements, 1 3 B27 supplements, and 0.1 mM NEAA) containing FGF8a
(50 ng/mL), SHH (100 ng/mL), ascorbic acid (200 mM), cyclic AMP (cAMP,
1 mM), laminin (1 mg/mL), TGF-b3 (1 ng/mL), brain-derived neurotrophic factor
(BDGF) (10 ng/mL), and glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF,
10 ng/mL). Media were half changed every other day. Neuronal cultures
were maintained for at least 100 days to obtain mature neurons for electro-
physiological recording.
Electrophysiology
Recordings were performed on iPSC-derived neurons (after at least 100 days
since the start of differentiation) from three parkin patients and three
normal subjects. Standard patch-clamp techniques were used in the sEPSC

 measurement (Jiang et al., 2015). The iPSC-derived neurons on coverslips
were put in a recording chamber, and they were perfused with artificial cere-
brospinal fluid (ACSF) (in mM: 130 NaCl, 26 NaHCO3, 3 KCl, 1 CaCl2, 5 MgCl2,
1.25 NaH2PO4, 10 glucose [pH 7.4], and 300 mOsm) bubbled with 95% O2
and 5% CO2. Neurons were visualized with a 403 water-immersion lens
and illuminated with near infrared light. The internal solution contained (in
mM): 124 K-gluconate, 1 MgCl2, 10 KCl, 0.5 CaCl2, 1 EGTA, 10 HEPES, 3
Na2ATP, 0.5 Na2GTP, 12 phosphocreatine (pH 7.2–7.3), and 280 mOsm. Tight
seals (2–5 GU) were first generated by negative pressure, followed by addi-
tional suction to obtain the whole-cell configuration. Neurons were held at
�70 mV and recorded in ACSF without GABAAR antagonist. To record
mEPSCs, TTX (1 mM) was added in external solution (ACSF) for at least
10 min to block spontaneous neuronal activities. Dopamine (100 mM) was
then added to examine its effect on mEPSCs in different types of neurons.
Quantal content of sEPSCs was calculated by dividing the sEPSC amplitude
by the mEPSC amplitude. All recordings were performed using a Multiclamp
700A amplifier. Data analysis was performed with Clampfit (Axon Instru-
ments), Mini Analysis Program (Syanptosoft), and Kaleidagraph (Albeck
Software).
Statistical Analysis
K-S tests (tailed, unpaired) were used to determine the significance of effects
on sEPSC. K-W tests (non-parametric tests) were used for comparison be-
tween the patients and the normal groups.
