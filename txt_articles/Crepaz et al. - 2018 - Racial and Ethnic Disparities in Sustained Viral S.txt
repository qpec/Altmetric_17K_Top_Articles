National Black HIV/AIDS Awareness 
Day — February 7, 2018
National Black HIV/AIDS Awareness Day is observed each 
year on February 7 to emphasize the continuing dispropor-
tionate impact of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) 
infection and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) 
on the U.S. black/African American (black) population.
In 2014, non-Hispanic blacks represented 12% of the U.S. 
population (1), and the estimated 471,500 blacks living with 
diagnosed and undiagnosed HIV infection accounted for 
43% of all persons living with diagnosed and undiagnosed 
HIV (2). In 2016, blacks represented 12% of the U.S. popu-
lation (1), and blacks with new HIV diagnoses accounted 
for 44% of all new HIV diagnoses (https://www.cdc.gov/
hiv/pdf/library/reports/surveillance/cdc-hiv-surveillance-report-
2016-vol-28.pdf).
In 2014, among blacks living with diagnosed HIV infec-
tion, in 38 jurisdictions with complete reporting of CD4 and 
viral load data, 69.8% received HIV medical care, and 51.5% 
were virally suppressed (viral load test of <200 copies of HIV 
RNA/mL) (2). A study reported in this issue of MMWR found 
racial and ethnic disparities in viral suppression and transmis-
sion risk (3). 
CDC supports a range of efforts to reduce the risk for 
acquiring or transmitting HIV infection among blacks.

(Hispanics) and non-Hispanic whites (whites) were on ART 
and had a suppressed viral load (<200 HIV RNA copies/mL) 
in their most recent viral load test result (3). Blacks also might 
be less likely to have sustained viral suppression over time 
and to experience longer periods with viral loads >1,500 HIV 
RNA copies/mL, a level that increases the risk for transmitting 
HIV (4–7). National HIV Surveillance System (NHSS) data 
are among those used to monitor progress toward reaching 
the national goal of reducing health disparities. CDC ana-
lyzed NHSS data to describe sustained viral suppression and 
transmission risk potential by race/ethnicity. Among 651,811 
persons with HIV infection diagnosed through 2013 and who 
were alive through 2014 in 38 jurisdictions with complete 
laboratory reporting, a lower percentage of blacks had sustained 
viral suppression (40.8%), than had Hispanics (50.1%) and 
whites (56.3%). Among persons who were in care (i.e., had 
at least one viral load test in 2014) and had  not achieved 
sustained viral suppression in 2014, blacks experienced lon-
ger periods (52.1% of the 12-month period) with viral loads 
>1,500 copies/mL, than did Hispanics (47.2%) and white 
(40.8%). Blacks aged 13–24 years had the lowest prevalence of 
sustained viral suppression, a circumstance that might increase 
transmission risk potential. Strengthening interventions that 
improve access to ART, promote adherence, and address bar-
riers to clinical care and supportive services for all persons 
with diagnosed HIV infection is important for achieving the 
national goal of reducing health disparities.
All states, the District of Columbia (DC), and U.S. territories 
report cases of HIV infection and associated demographic and 
clinical information to NHSS. CDC analyzed data from NHSS 
reported through June 2017 from 37 states and DC with com-
plete laboratory reporting. These jurisdictions accounted for 
71.9% of persons living with diagnosed HIV infection at the 
end of 2014 in the United States. This analysis includes persons 
aged ≥13 years who received a diagnosis of HIV infection by 
December 31, 2013, most recently resided in one of the 38 
jurisdictions, and were alive at the end of 2014. For persons 
who had two or more viral load tests in 2014, sustained viral 
suppression was defined as viral load test results of <200 copies 
of HIV RNA/mL for all tests in 2014. For persons who had 
only one viral load test in 2014, sustained viral suppression 
was defined as a viral load test result of <200 copies/mL for 
the 2014 test and also for the last viral load test in 2013. Both 
groups were included in the numerator. Persons with partial 
viral suppression in 2014 (i.e., some, but not all viral load test 
results <200 copies/mL) were excluded from the numerator 
but included in the denominator. Persons with no viral load 
tests in 2014 were presumed not to be suppressed and were 
excluded from the numerator. The numbers and percentages of 
persons with sustained, partial, and no viral suppression were 
calculated. All persons living with diagnosed HIV at the end 
of 2014 were included in the denominator for determining 
the percentage with sustained viral suppression.
HIV transmission potential was estimated among persons in 
care who did not achieve sustained viral suppression and was

defined as the number of days that a person’s viral load was 
>1,500 copies/mL. The estimated number of days with viral 
load >1,500 copies/mL was calculated for each person and then 
was averaged across the analytic cohort (5,6). Persons with no 
viral load test in 2014 were considered to be not in care and 
were not included when calculating transmission potential. 
Sustained viral suppression and transmission risk potential were 
assessed by sex, age, and transmission category, stratified by 
race/ethnicity. Data were adjusted using multiple imputation 
to account for 17.9% missing HIV transmission categories (8).
In the 38 jurisdictions, 651,811 persons with HIV infec-
tion diagnosed through 2013 were alive at the end of 2014, 
including 263,588 (40.4%) blacks, 199,700 (30.6%) whites, 
149,117 (22.9%) Hispanics, and 39,406 (6.1%) other racial/
ethnic groups (data for other racial/ethnic groups not shown). 
The median number of viral load tests in 2014 was two, with 
356,223 (54.7%) persons having two or more tests, 95,926 
(14.7%) having one test, and 199,662 (30.6%) having no test 
in 2014. The percentage of persons without a viral load test 
in 2014 was 33.9% among blacks, 29.9% among Hispanics, 
and 28.2% among whites.
Among all persons living with diagnosed HIV infection in 
the 38 jurisdictions, 48.4% had sustained viral suppression in 
2014. A lower proportion of blacks had sustained viral suppres-
sion (40.8%), than did Hispanics (50.1%) and whites (56.3%). 
Across the sex, age, and transmission category subgroups, the 
proportion of blacks with sustained viral suppression was 
lower than that of Hispanics and whites (Table 1). Blacks 
aged 13–24 years had the lowest prevalence of sustained viral 
suppression (29.2%).
Among 136,759 persons who were in care in 2014, but did 
not achieve sustained viral suppression, 89,245 (65%) had at 
least one viral load test result of >1,500 copies/mL in 2014. 
Overall, the mean number of days with a viral load >1,500 
copies/mL was 176 (48.3% of the 12-month period). The mean 
number of days with a viral load >1,500 copies/mL was higher 
among blacks (190 days, 52.1% of the 12-month period) than 
among Hispanics (172 days, 47.2%) and whites (149 days, 
40.8%) (Table 2). Across all sex, age, and transmission category

Discussion
Viral suppression is essential to maintaining the health of 
persons living with HIV infection and reducing the likeli-
hood of HIV transmission. National treatment guidelines 
recommend that all persons with diagnosed HIV infection, 
regardless of their viral load or CD4 level, take ART to achieve 
viral suppression.† However, only 40.8% of blacks living with 
Summary
What is already known about this topic?
African Americans/Blacks (blacks) accounted for a dispropor-
tionally high percentage of persons living with diagnosed 
human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in 2014. 
Between 2009 and 2013, antiretroviral therapy prescriptions 
have increased more among blacks who received HIV clinical 
care compared with Hispanics and whites. However, fewer 
blacks received antiretroviral therapy prescriptions compared 
with other racial/ethnic groups, and more blacks did not have a 
suppressed viral load.
What is added by this report?
In 2014, fewer blacks living with diagnosed HIV infection had 
sustained viral suppression (all viral load test results in 2014 
<200 HIV RNA copies/mL) compared with Hispanics and whites. 
Among those who were in care and did not achieve sustained 
viral suppression, blacks had viral loads >1,500 copies/mL for 
approximately half of the 12-month period in 2014; this 
circumstance can adversely affect their health outcomes and 
pose a risk for further transmission. Blacks aged 13–24 years had 
the lowest prevalence of sustained viral suppression.
What are the implication for public health practice?
Collaboration among health care providers, community-based 
organizations, and state and local health departments to 
strengthen programs that address barriers to HIV care, 
antiretroviral therapy prescription, medication adherence, and 
sustained viral suppression among blacks, especially blacks 
aged 13–24 years, could be beneficial in eliminating racial/
ethnic disparities. 
diagnosed HIV infection in 38 jurisdictions with complete 
laboratory reporting had sustained viral suppression in 2014, 
a percentage lower than that among Hispanics (50.1%) and 
whites (56.3%). The remaining 59.2% of blacks included 
25.3% who were in care but did not have sustained viral sup-
pression in 2014 (i.e., partial suppression or not suppressed) 
and 33.9% with no viral load tests in 2014. The latter is an 
indication of not receiving adequate HIV care and presum-
ably not having suppressed viral load. Among those in care, 
blacks experienced a longer period (i.e., half of the time during 
the 12-month period) with a viral load >1,500 copies/mL, a 
circumstance which can adversely affect health outcomes and 
pose a risk for further transmission. Although prescription of 
ART increased among blacks who received HIV clinical care 
from 2009 to 2013, fewer blacks received an ART prescription 
(92.9%) than did Hispanics (95.2%) and whites (95.2%) (3). 
These findings highlight areas for improvement in care reten-
tion and offering of ART to all persons with HIV infection 
according to the national treatment guidelines.
The racial/ethnic differences in sustained viral suppression 
were present across all sex, age, and transmission categories,

and the lowest prevalence of sustained viral suppression was 
found among blacks aged 13–24 years. Lower viral suppres-
sion, combined with the higher prevalences of HIV among 
blacks compared with other racial/ethnic groups, could lead to 
a higher HIV transmission risk potential. Barriers such as lack 
of health insurance, limited access to health services, stigma, 
health literacy, and lack of trust in providers and the care sys-
tem might be contributing to these disparities (9). Addressing 
barriers to care and treatment is important to improving the 
health of persons living with HIV and reducing disparities.
The findings in this report are subject to at least three limita-
tions. First, analyses were limited to 38 jurisdictions with com-
plete reporting of all levels of CD4 and viral load test results; 
these jurisdictions might not be representative of all persons 
living with diagnosed HIV infection in the United States. 
Second, persons might have moved out of a jurisdiction after 
their latest address was recorded in the 38 jurisdictions, and 
this migration might contribute to missing viral load records. 
Finally, 30.6% of 651,811 persons living with a diagnosis of 
HIV did not have any viral load test in 2014 and were not 
included in the analysis for transmission risk potential. Many 
of these persons might not have had a suppressed viral load 
and might have experienced longer periods with viral loads 
>1,500 copies/mL. The transmission risk potential for this 
group is likely to be high, but cannot be determined because 
of unavailability of viral load data.
Addressing ongoing racial/ethnic disparities in sustained viral 
suppression is important to efforts to reduce HIV infections in 
the United States. CDC is pursuing a high-impact prevention 
approach that combines scientifically proven, cost-effective, 
and scalable interventions, including expanding HIV testing 
and increasing treatment adherence (10) to reduce HIV infec-
tions and increase the effectiveness of HIV prevention and care 
activities. CDC supports projects that aim to reduce undiag-
nosed infections, improve engagement in care, and increase 
sustained viral suppression across all racial/ethnic groups. To 
reach the national goal of reducing health disparities, tailored 
strategies that address barriers to achieving and sustaining viral 
suppression among blacks, especially those aged 13–24 years, 
are needed. Continued collaboration among health care pro-
viders, community-based organizations, and state and local 
health departments might strengthen programs that address 
those barriers.
