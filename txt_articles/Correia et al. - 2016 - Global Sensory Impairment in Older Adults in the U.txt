OBJECTIVES: To determine whether there may be a com-
mon mechanism resulting in global sensory impairment of
the five classical senses (vision, smell, hearing, touch, and
taste) in older adults.
DESIGN: Representative, population-based study.
SETTING: National
Social
Life,
Health,
and
Aging
Project.
PARTICIPANTS: Community-dwelling U.S. adults aged
57 to 85.
MEASUREMENTS: The frequency with which impair-
ment co-occurred across the five senses was estimated as
an integrated measure of sensory aging. It was hypothe-
sized that multisensory deficits would be common and
reflect
global
sensory
impairment
that
would
largely
explain the effects of age, sex, and race on sensory dys-
function.
RESULTS: Two-thirds of subjects had two or more sen-
sory deficits, 27% had just one, and 6% had none.
Seventy-four percent had impairment in taste, 70% in
touch, 22% in smell, 20% in corrected vision, and 18% in
corrected hearing. Older adults, men, African Americans,
and Hispanics had greater multisensory impairment (all
P < .01). Global sensory impairment largely accounted for
the effects of age, sex, and race on the likelihood of
impairment in each of the five senses.
CONCLUSION: Multisensory impairment is prevalent in
older U.S. adults. These data support the concept of a com-
mon process that underlies sensory aging across the five
senses. Clinicians assessing individuals with a sensory deficit
should consider further evaluation for additional co-occur-
ring sensory deficits. J Am Geriatr Soc 64:306–313, 2016.

A
ging has long been associated with decline in sensory
function, a critical component of the health and qual-
ity of life of older people.1 Prior work has demonstrated
that olfactory loss is associated with cognitive decline,
highlighting its importance as an early warning sign of
neurological decline with its attendant morbidity and com-
promised physical function,2–4 and that it strongly and
independently predicts all-cause 5-year mortality.2,5 These
and other data are consistent with the idea that sensory
function is a critical component of health and life itself.
Data from studies of single sensory deficits support
this concept. For example, vision impairment is correlated
with depression, poor quality of life, cognitive decline, and
mortality.6–8 Hearing loss is associated with slower gait
speed9 (a marker of physical decline), poor cognition, and
mortality.10 Like smell, taste has been associated with
nutritional compromise11 and in patient mortality,12 sug-
gesting that chemosensory function is critical. Tactile dis-
crimination declines with age13 due to the cumulative
effects of decreased nerve conduction velocity,14 decreased
density of Meissner’s and Pacinian corpuscles, and gray
matter changes in the central nervous system and is also
associated with cognitive decline.15
Individual sensory impairments are common. The
prevalence of hearing loss (33%) and vision impairment
(18%) is high in older adults (≥70).16,17 Similarly, deficits
in smell (24%)18,19 and taste (up to ~61%) are widely
prevalent in adults aged 70 and older.20 Impairment in
touch is noted in adults as young as 55.21 These sensory
losses have a major effect on how older adults live and
function, often with profound consequences. As the popu-
lation ages, these burdens will grow.
Despite these important consequences, little is known
about the prevalence of deficits in multiple sensory sys-
tems, their combined effect, or common mechanisms that
drive the underlying biology. Although some studies have

 measured the prevalence of concurrent poor vision and
hearing22 (dual sensory impairment), to the knowledge of
the authors of the current study, none has measured other
senses in an elderly population. The importance of consid-
ering simultaneous impairments is clear from studies of
vision and hearing, which have shown that dual losses
interfere synergistically with independent function, presage
cognitive decline, and signal greater mortality.23–25
The close connection between these various sensory
deficits, cognitive decline, and even death suggest the pos-
sibility that global sensory decline, define here as a com-
mon physiological process underlying deterioration of the
classical senses, is an early indicator of neurodegenera-
tion,2,12,20,24 with attendant poor social and health out-
comes.1 Additionally, frequent associations between health
outcomes and each of the different five classical senses
may reflect common mechanisms underlying the effects of
aging on these systems. These could include peripheral
nerve dysfunction, changes in sensory integration at the
central level,26 lack of regenerative capacity,27 and sec-
ondary metabolic effects (e.g., consequences of atheroscle-
rosis
or
lipidemia).28
Finally,
because
dual
sensory
impairment has been shown to have greater effects on
function than single deficits,24 one would expect multisen-
sory impairment (impairment of more than two senses) to
cause even more detrimental health effects. Despite this,
to the knowledge of the authors, no study has examined
multiple sensory impairments in a national population
sample.
To address multisensory impairment, data were ana-
lyzed from the National Social Life, Health, and Aging
Project (NSHAP), a longitudinal population-based study of
adults aged 57–85 that collected extensive health and
social measures through in-home interviews and respon-
dent-administered questionnaires.29 Sensory function was
assessed in all five classical senses,30 and respondents were
asked about their physical and mental health, medication
use, cognition, and health behaviors. NSHAP and sec-
ondary analyses of these data have provided insights into a
number of aspects of aging.31–33 NSHAP offers a unique
opportunity to examine sensory function broadly.
The prevalence of multisensory impairment was esti-
mated, and a model of global sensory impairment was
developed based on the interrelationships between mea-
sures of all five senses. It was hypothesized that multisen-
sory deficits would be common in older adults, more
prevalent in men and minorities, and occur more often
with increasing age. The concept of global sensory impair-
ment is introduced, a process that it was hypothesized
would largely account for the effects of age, sex, and race
on the likelihood of impairment in each of the five senses.
METHODS
NSHAP Study Design
Respondents
In 2005–06,
interviewers
from
the
National
Opinion
Research Center (NORC) conducted in-home interviews
with 3,005 community-dwelling older adults (1,454 men,
1,551 women) identified using a probability sample of the
population of community-dwelling adults born between
1920 and 1947 (aged 57–85) in the United States.34,35 The
NORC and University of Chicago institutional review
boards approved this study, and all respondents provided
written, informed consent.
NSHAP used a modular study design. All respondents
were administered a core interview and provided a stan-
dard set of biomeasures in their homes, including olfaction
and gustation testing and hearing assessment. Half the
respondents were also randomized to receive vision and
touch testing.30 The analytical sample included the 2,968
respondents who had data on two or more of the five
senses (Table 1). Of the 1,506 respondents eligible to
receive all sensory modules, 1,301 (86%) had complete
data.30 Race and Hispanic ethnicity were measured using
the
standard
National
Institutes
of
Health
items,
as
reported previously,36 and respondents were coded as
white (non-Hispanic), black, Hispanic (excluding those
who self-identified as black), and other. Respondents were
asked whether they had received a physician’s diagnosis of
diabetes mellitus, stroke, heart failure, hypertension, or
myocardial infarction and were asked to rate their overall
physical health using the standard categories excellent,
very good, good, fair, and poor. Data missing for one or
more sensory measures because of the study design were,
by definition, missing completely at random and therefore
did not introduce any bias into the analysis (only a loss of
precision, relative to a design in which all respondents
were administered all items). Although there was some
item
nonresponse
because
of
respondent
refusal
(or
responses of don’t know) for each sensory dysfunction
item, this nonresponse was in general low, limiting the
magnitude of any potential bias.
Sensory Function
Vision
Participants wore their usual glasses or contact lenses, and
corrected distance visual acuity was assessed under home
lighting conditions using a Snellen chart test with a stan-
dardized protocol.30 Corrected vision was chosen to deter-
mine the actual functional level respondents experienced in
daily life, consistent with prior benchmark studies.37 Cate-
gories for visual acuity corresponded to those required for
a driver’s license (good = 20/40 or better, fair =20/50 to
20/63, poor = worse than 20/63).
Touch
Tactile sensitivity was assessed using a 2-point discrimina-
tion test on the index finger of the dominant hand with
eyes closed.30 Three 2-point tests were conducted at inter-
point distances of 12, 8, and 4 mm and a single point after
the 12-mm test. A 4-mm threshold (good) was defined as
correctly identifying two points at all three distances plus
the single point test; an 8-mm threshold (fair) was cor-
rectly identifying two points at 12 and 8 mm plus the sin-
gle point test but not 4 mm, and a 12-mm threshold
(poor) was correctly identifying two points only at 12 mm
plus the single point test. All other response patterns were
considered nondiscriminating and also categorized as poor.

 Smell
Olfaction was evaluated using a validated 5-item odor
identification
test
with
felt
tip
pens,38
as
previously
described.36 A single odorant was presented, and respon-
dents were instructed to select one of four word or picture
choices, with refusals coded as incorrect. Four or five
errors was considered poor (anosmic), two or three errors
as fair (hyposmic), and one or no errors as good (nor-
mosmic).
Taste
Gustation was evaluated using four filter paper strips30
that were applied to the tongue in the following order:
sour, bitter, sweet, and salty, with a sip of water between
each application.30 Respondents were asked to describe
the taste using the same four descriptors. Responses of
tried, unable to do; refused; or don’t know were counted
as incorrect. Two to four errors was categorized as poor
(ageusic), one error as fair (hypogeusic), and no errors as
good (normogeusic).
Hearing
The field interviewer assessed respondents’ conversational
hearing during the interview afterward on a 5-point scale
(1 = practically deaf, 5 = normal hearing).30 Scores of 4 or
5 were categorized as good, 3 as fair, and 1 or 2 as poor.
Respondents who chose to wear hearing aids during the
interview were permitted to do so but not required. Time
and resource constraints of the omnibus survey precluded
the use of additional psychophysical measures of hearing
(e.g., audiometry).
Statistical Analysis
Estimates of the prevalence of impairment (defined as hav-
ing fair or poor function) for each sense and of the distri-
bution of the total number of impairments among the U.S.
national population of home-dwelling older adults (aged
57–85) were obtained by using the sampling weights pro-
vided with the dataset to account for differential probabili-
ties
of
selection
and
nonresponse,
as
previously
described.35 Estimates of the population prevalence of sev-
eral comorbid diseases and of the distribution of self-rated
physical health and the demographic variables age, sex,
and race and ethnicity are also presented.
Ordinal probit regression was used to model the rela-
tionship between sensory dysfunction (good, fair, poor)
and age, sex, and race and ethnicity for each of the five
senses individually (Figure 1A). Ordinal probit regression
is a straightforward extension of the probit regression
model, with the (standard) normal distribution presumed
to underlie the response being split according to multiple
cutpoints (≤1 than the number of observed categories of
the outcome) instead of just one. Thus, the coefficients for
the covariates have an interpretation identical to that of
those from probit regression—namely, as the change in
standard units of the underlying normal variable associated
with a one-unit change in the covariate. A generalized sin-
gle-factor measurement model (Figure 2B) was then fit to
the five observed sensory dysfunction measures, assuming
a single latent variable (with variance equal to 1) capturing
global sensory impairment, which predicts each of the five
sensory dysfunction measures through an ordinal probit
regression.39 The proportion of variance in its underlying
distribution (as specified by the ordinal probit regression
model) explained by global sensory impairment was calcu-
lated for each dysfunction measure. This model was then
expanded by specifying global sensory impairment to be a
function of age (in decades), sex, and race and ethnicity
(white, black, Hispanic (nonblack), other) (Figure 2C).
Finally, this structural equation model (SEM) was aug-
mented by adding direct effects of the demographic covari-
ates on each of the sensory dysfunction measures one at a
time (Figure 2D). Indirect effects of age on each dysfunc-
tion (through its effect on global sensory impairment) were
calculated and compared with the direct effects of age.40

 statistically significant. All analyses were performed using
Stata release 13.1 (StataCorp LP, College Station, TX).
RESULTS
Prevalence of Individual Sensory Impairments
Overall
Taste impairment was the most prevalent sensory deficit,
with 74% of respondents having an impaired sense of taste
(26% fair, 48% poor) (Table 1). Also prevalent was touch
impairment, estimated to be fair in 38% of older adults
and poor in 32%. Fourteen percent had fair corrected dis-
tance vision (20/50 to 20/63), and another 6% had poor
corrected distance vision (20/80 or worse). Nineteen per-
cent had a fair sense of smell, and 3% had a poor sense of
smell. Thirteen percent had fair corrected hearing, and 5%
had poor corrected hearing.
Association with Age, Sex, and Race and Ethnicity
Older people had worse function in all five senses, with
the largest differences being for hearing, vision, and smell
(Table 2A, Figure 1). Men had worse hearing, smell, and
taste but better corrected vision than women. Blacks and
Hispanics had worse sensory function than whites on all
measures except for hearing, for which there was no evi-
dence of racial or ethnic differences, and for taste, for
which blacks had worse function than whites, but Hispan-
ics had better function (Figure S1).
Prevalence of Co-Occurring Sensory Impairments
Sensory deficits were widely prevalent in older U.S. adults,
with 94% demonstrating at least one sensory deficit
(Table 1). Sixty-seven percent of older adults had two or
more sensory deficits, with two impairments being the
most common (38%) (Figure 1). These deficits were corre-
lated; for example, 34% had none or one, and 8% had
four or five, compared with the 28% and 6%, respectively,
that would be expected under the null hypothesis of inde-
pendence of the senses. Sixty-five percent had substantial
impairment (poor functioning) in at least one sense and
22% in two or more.
Global Sensory Impairment
Each of the sensory outcomes was associated with a single
common factor (Table 3, Single-Factor Model; Figure 2B),
with the strongest associations for vision and smell, fol-
lowed by hearing. This factor explains a significant pro-
portion of the variation in the underlying distributions of
the individual sensory deficits (hearing, 0.15; vision, 0.33;
smell, 0.30; touch, 0.08; taste 0.05). The effects of a � 1-
standard deviation change in this factor on the actual
probability of each deficit are illustrated in Figure S2.
Global sensory impairment (the common factor) was
strongly associated with age, sex, and race and ethnicity
(Table 3, Structural Equation Model; Figure 2C). Consis-
tent with the individual results for each sense reported
above, older age was associated with greater global sen-
sory impairment, which was also higher for men than for
women and for blacks and Hispanics than whites.
To test the hypothesis that global sensory impairment
accounts for much of the association between age and
individual sensory deficits and to examine the fit of the
model, direct effects of the demographic covariates on
each of the sensory deficits were added one at a time to
the structural equation model (Table 2B; Figure 2D). For

sory

 association with age, as judged by the fact that the direct
effects of age on these senses were not statistically signifi-
cant. Only for hearing and taste were the direct effects of
age significant. For hearing, the direct effect of age was
0.28 (slightly larger than the indirect effect through global
sensory impairment of 0.22), and for taste, the estimated
direct effect of �0.21 reflects the fact that the association
between age and taste dysfunction is the weakest of all the
senses (as noted above). Thus, global sensory impairment
explained most of the association between age and the
individual sensory dysfunction outcomes.
DISCUSSION
Multisensory loss is remarkably common in older U.S.
adults and seems to be driven by a common underlying
process. To the knowledge of the authors, this population-
based study is the first to examine the full spectrum of sen-
sory loss across the five classical senses in a representative
sample of older adults and emphasizes the broad and
prevalent sensory burden that this growing segment of the
population faces.
Prior studies have established that 6% of older adults
have impaired vision and hearing.22 The current study
results suggest that these same adults may also have addi-
tional sensory impairments. Across all five senses, 38% of
older adults had two impairments and 28% had three or
more. Twenty-two percent had substantial impairment
(poor function) in two or more sensory modalities, repre-
senting a significant burden. Other recent studies of mul-
tiple
sensory
impairments
support
these
findings
and
suggest important associations with function and quality
of life with carefully measured sensory measures.41–43
These studies did not focus exclusively on older adults;
addressed representative populations; included touch; or
in one case,43 used objective measures. These and other
factors
may
explain
variability
in
findings
between
studies.

 A single underlying factor, which was interpreted as
global
sensory
impairment,
may
explain
a
significant
amount of the variation in each of the sensory dysfunc-
tions. This single factor accounts for much of the associa-
tion between age and each of the sensory impairments,
suggesting a common process of sensory aging. There are
several possible mechanisms, shared across the senses,
which could link their deficits during aging: neurodegener-
ation,20,44 secondary effects of common environmental
insults,28,45 underlying genetics such as variation in genes
involved in nerve maintenance or innate immunity,46 coor-
dinate cellular senescence, or combinations thereof.
The concept of global sensory impairment also leads to
new ways of thinking about how other factors such as sex
and race and ethnicity may affect sensory function through
this common mechanism. Many studies have found associa-
tions between sex, race, ethnicity, and individual sensory
impairment22,36 and have proposed mechanisms to explain
these. The results here differ in that they investigate the rela-
tionship between these factors across all five senses. For
example, other than for corrected vision, women seem to be
better protected from sensory loss than men, highlighting
the prospect of a biological mechanism. The higher preva-
lence and severity of multisensory impairment in blacks is
especially troubling given the well-documented disparities
in access, treatment, and outcomes that they face.
There are important clinical implications of these data.
Clinicians who see patients with single or dual sensory
deficits (e.g., with hearing or vision loss or both) should
consider evaluation of the other senses, because it is highly
likely that such individuals will have these undiagnosed
conditions. Individuals with multisensory impairment may
be at higher risk of important sequelae such as neurode-
generation and complications from falls, burns, food poi-
soning,
smoke
inhalation,
and
others.
If
these
other
conditions are identified, even in the face of limited treat-
ment options, mitigation through awareness, social inter-
vention through family or caregiver support, or other
means may be instituted. This burden of multisensory
impairment may affect people’s ability to manage social,
cognitive, and physical stresses, so attention to these con-
cerns is critical.
There are several limitations of these findings. High
rates of multisensory impairment were found in the gen-
eral population of older adults living at home, but individ-
uals in a clinic or institutionalized setting may be at even
higher risk. Conversely, one recent study that included
objective measures of sensory function showed minimal
multisensory impairment in adults younger than 45.42
Although corrected vision and hearing were measured, def-
icits in the home environment were still found, which
should prompt clinicians to be sensitive to the discrepancy
between clinic- and home-based assessment of sensory
function and the consequences for care. For example,
clinic-based estimates of sensory function, under optimal
controlled conditions, may minimize the effect on daily life
because they do not account for the real-world experience
of people in their own home environments.

aCoefficients from ordinal probit regressions of each three-category sen-
sory dysfunction measure on the underlying factor (global sensory impair-
ment), each indicating the change in the likelihood (on the probit scale) of
being above a given cutpoint associated with a 1–standard deviation
increase in the underlying factor.
bCoefficients indicate the change in the underlying factor associated with a
1-unit change in the demographic covariate (residual variance of the
underlying factor is constrained to equal 1).

MULTISENSORY LOSS IN OLDER U.S. ADULTS
311
 In addition, this model does not explain everything
observed in the data, and there are some important
deviations, which are consistent with prior findings in the
literature. For example, sex reliably predicted sensory dys-
function, with men being worse than women in all senses
except for corrected vision, in which women were worse.
This difference may reflect a sex disparity in obtaining or
using adequate corrective lenses. Women may also have
faster rates of decline in vision than men, perhaps indicat-
ing an underlying susceptibility to age-related vision loss.
This is troubling given previous work demonstrating that,
in older women, vision impairment is a risk factor for cog-
nitive decline.23 Medicare fails to cover eyeglasses or con-
tact lenses, so this may also reflect lack of financial
resources of women.
Finally, the integrated measure of hearing was based on
the interviewer’s assessment during social conversation in
the home. Subsequent work could expand on this study by
including audiometry as an objective measure of hearing
(e.g., at speech and other frequencies), although its inclusion
is challenging (but not impossible, for screening at least1) in
large field studies without specialized personnel and equip-
ment (e.g., audiometer, sound booth). The measure of the
ability to hear conversational speech in the home is a major
strength of NSHAP in that the focus is on the typical envi-
ronment and social context that older adults experience in
their everyday lives, in contrast to clinic- or hospital-based
assessments. From this perspective, it is likely that the bur-
den of hearing loss in this population is underestimated.
Similarly, the measures of sensory function could be
enriched (e.g., the addition of near vision, olfactory sensitiv-
ity, more precise measures), although it is unlikely that such
enriched measures would alter the main results.
What are the implications of these findings? Because
of the critical nature of these sensory modalities in daily
living, the results of multisensory loss may explain, in part,
why older adults report poorer quality of life and chal-
lenges in interacting with the environment and other peo-
ple.16 The current data also prompt further questions
about the relationship between global sensory impairment
and physical frailty and the concept of decline across mul-
tiple domains of physical performance, potentially includ-
ing
shared
physiological
mechanisms.37
Are
they
independent processes, or does global sensory loss develop
simultaneously with physical frailty, worsening its effect
(e.g., weight loss, falls, decreased physical activity) and
even increasing the risk of mortality? Given that older
adults face major changes in sensory perception, creating
deleterious effects on health and function, future work
should characterize global sensory impairment and exam-
ine the trajectory of its decline in longitudinal studies. Cur-
rent measures of physical frailty have proven important in
the management of the healthcare needs of older adults
and an analogous consideration of multisensory impair-
ment may prove useful.
In summary, further examination of multisensory loss
in older adults will provide answers to these and other
gaps in knowledge and allow preventative measures to be
designed or therapeutic targets in the underlying biology
that is common to these five sensory modalities to be iden-
tified, with great promise for alleviating the suffering that
they cause.
