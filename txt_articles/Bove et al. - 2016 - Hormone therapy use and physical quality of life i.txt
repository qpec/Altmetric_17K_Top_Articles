Hormone therapy use and physical quality
of life in postmenopausal women with
multiple sclerosis
ABSTRACT
Objective: To determine the association between hormone therapy (HT) and physical quality of life
(QOL) in postmenopausal women with multiple sclerosis (MS).
Methods: We included female participants from the prospective Nurses’ Health Study, with a diag-
nosis of definite or probable MS, who had completed a physical functioning assessment (PF10;
subscale of the 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey QOL survey) at a time point between 3 and 10
years after their final menstrual period (early postmenopause). We assessed the association
between HT use at this time point (never vs at least 12 months of systemic estrogen with/without
progestin) and both PF10 and the 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey Physical Component Scale.
We used a linear regression model adjusting for age, MS duration, menopause type and duration,
and further for additional covariates (only ancestry was significant).
Results: Among 95 participants meeting all inclusion criteria at their first postmenopausal assess-
ment, 61 reported HT use and 34 reported none. HT users differed from non–HT users in MS
duration (p 5 0.02) and menopause type (p 5 0.01) but no other clinical or demographic charac-
teristics. HT users had average PF10 scores that were 23 points higher than non–HT users
(adjusted p 5 0.004) and average Physical Component Scale scores that were 9.1 points higher
in the 59 women with these available (adjusted p 5 0.02). Longer duration of HT use was also
associated with higher PF10 scores (p 5 0.02, adjusted p 5 0.06).
Conclusions: Systemic HT use was associated with better physical QOL in postmenopausal
women with MS in this observational study. Further studies are necessary to investigate
causality. Neurology® 2016;87:1457–1463

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory and neurodegenerative disease in which onset
and course may be modified by hormonal exposures.1 In MS, there is an age-related increase in
disability and conversion to progressive course observed at approximately age 45 years, while the
incidence of new inflammatory symptoms or lesions diminishes.2 Little is known about the
effect of hormonal changes occurring at menopause on MS course and whether hormone
therapy (HT) modulates these changes.3,4
In healthy women, a decline in cognition has been observed after menopause, especially with
the abrupt decline in hormones occurring when menopause is induced surgically,5,6 and HT,
when initiated within a 5-year perimenopausal “window of opportunity,” has been reported
to protect against cognitive decline.5–7 Investigating possible protective effects of HT on
MS-related functional decline would have important clinical implications for women who
develop MS before menopause, comprising the majority of MS cases.8

 Therefore, we assessed whether HT is asso-
ciated with improved physical quality of life
(QOL) in the Nurses’ Health Study (NHS),
a large, longitudinal cohort of US women.
METHODS Participants. The NHS began in 1976 when
121,700 female registered nurses, aged 30 to 55 years, married,
and living in 1 of 11 states, completed a lifestyle and medical his-
tory questionnaire. Women update their health behavior and
medical information via questionnaire every 2 years.
Case ascertainment. We identified 248 women with inci-
dent definite or probable MS in the NHS between 1976 and
2004, as previously described.9,10 For the current study, we
included only participants with known date of MS diagnosis
(figure e-1 at Neurology.org).
Outcome measure. The 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey
(SF-36)11 is a multi-item scale assessing 8 patient-reported,
health-related domains that is used widely in MS research12,13
as well as in HT trials.14 It incorporates 8 subscales, including
the 10-item physical functioning (PF10) scale.13 The PF10 was
administered in the NHS every 4 years from 1992 to 2012, while
the full SF-36 was administered in 1992, 1996, and 2000.
Our primary a priori SF-36 subscale of interest was PF10.
This measure was selected because it was available for the most
study participants, is decreased even in fully ambulatory patients
with MS with low disability,13 and in other cohorts has shown
good correlation with the primary clinical MS severity measure,
Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) (e.g., r 5 20.7215).
The PF10 assesses performance in the following 10 activities:
vigorous activities, moderate activities, lifting/carrying groceries,
climbing several flights of stairs, climbing one flight of stairs,
bending/kneeling/stooping, walking more than a mile, walking
one block, walking several blocks, and bathing/dressing. Partici-
pants rate each domain on a 3-point scale: “Does your health
now limit you in these activities? Yes, limited a lot; yes, limited
a little; no, not limited at all.” The score is then summed and
converted to a 100-point scale. The Physical Component Scale
(PCS) is a composite score, also scaled to 100, that incorporates
scores in the PF10 as well as the “role physical,” “general health,”
and “bodily pain” domains of the SF-36.11
Reproductive variables. Postmenopausal time point. Repro-
ductive variables were obtained from biennial questionnaires, as
previously reported in NHS (e.g., reference 16). Date of meno-
pause was defined as the date of last menstrual period beyond
which no menses occurred for 1 year (natural), or date of sur-
gery (surgical), according to the Stages of Reproductive Aging
Workshop 1 10 guidelines.17 Type of menopause was catego-
rized as resulting from (1) natural physiology, (2) bilateral oopho-
rectomy with or without hysterectomy, (3) hysterectomy with
unilateral oophorectomy or hysterectomy without oophorectomy.
Participants with menopause resulting from chemotherapy or radi-
ation, or of uncertain type, were excluded.
For participants with known date of menopause, we identified
the date of the first postmenopausal response for each of the SF-36
subscales. This assessment occurred at least 3 years, and fewer than
10 years, post menopause. This timeframe was selected to represent
the first time point in the early postmenopausal period, but beyond
the window of most pronounced perimenopausal hormonal and
symptomatic fluctuations, according to the Stages of Reproductive
Aging Workshop 1 10 guidelines.17
HT use. Participants were categorized based on HT exposure.
We defined HT users as women who at the time of the first
postmenopausal SF-36/PF10 assessment had used estrogen
(conjugated estrogens [e.g., Premarin; Pfizer, New York, NY] or
other estrogen) with or without progestogens in systemic
administration (patch or oral) for at least 12 months. We defined
non–HT users as women with no prior exposure to HT. The 22
participants who reported other formulations (black cohosh,
testosterone), local application (gel or cream), or use for less than
12 months, were excluded because of heterogeneity of for-
mulations and small sample size.
Covariates. Every 2 years, women update their current weight
and smoking status. From this information, we calculated current
body mass index (BMI) in kg/m2 and smoking pack-years.
Beginning in
1984,
women completed a
food-frequency
questionnaire every 4 years (after 1986), including whether
they use multivitamins or other supplements, from which we
determine their intake of vitamin D per day (0, ,400 IU,
$400
IU).
Women
reported
their
ancestry
(Southern
European, Scandinavian, other Caucasian, other) and their state
of residence at age 15 in 1992, which were categorized into tiers
(north, middle, south) as previously described.18 They reported
their weight at age 18 in 1990, and using the height they reported
at baseline, we calculated BMI at age 18. Total physical activity is
reported every 2 years as the average time spent per week
performing various activities (e.g., running, swimming, etc).
Each activity is assigned a metabolic equivalent (MET) score
and METs are summed over all activities for a measure of total
physical activity level in METs/wk. A full summary of inclusion
and exclusion criteria is provided in figure e-1.
Standard protocol approvals, registrations, and patient
consents. Institutional review board approval was granted by the
Partners Human Research Committee.
Statistical analysis. We compared the demographic and disease
characteristics of HT users vs non–HT users using t tests and
x2 tests.
The effect of HT use (dichotomous variable, ever/never) on
postmenopausal SF-36 subscales was assessed using linear regres-
sion models. Models were adjusted for age, then further adjusted
for MS duration (time since diagnosis), time since menopause,
and menopausal type (natural, bilateral oophorectomy, other sur-
gical). We also repeated the model in women with definite MS
(n 5 77) and in women with natural menopause only (n 5
60); sample sizes were too small to examine effects in the surgical
menopause groups (bilateral and unilateral oophorectomy, and
hysterectomy only).
We also examined potential confounding by ancestry, smok-
ing (cumulative pack-years), supplemental vitamin D intake,
BMI at SF-36 subscale time point, BMI at age 18, latitude of res-
idence at age 15, and physical activity at the time of the last pre-
menopausal assessment. The effect of each covariate on the
estimate of the association between HT use and PF10 and PCS
scores was examined using separate linear regression models to
develop the most parsimonious model; any covariate that altered
the estimate size by at least 15% was retained in a further adjusted
model. We then examined the effect of HT duration, as measured
continuously in months, on PF10 and PCS levels at the first
assessment after menopause.
To assess whether differences in PF10 observed among HT
users and nonusers might reflect differences attributable to
non–HT-related factors, we compared available PF10 scores for
participants at a prior, premenopausal time point (i.e., 4 years
before the selected postmenopausal time point, in the late peri-
menopausal phase17) during which time none of them were on
HT. In this analysis, we compared the change in premenopausal

 PF10 scores for the HT “never-users” from our postmenopausal
analysis, with the change in premenopausal PF10 scores for “sub-
sequent users,” i.e., participants who did not use HT at the pre-
menopausal time point but who subsequently began HT. We
adjusted for MS duration and age, and in further sensitivity anal-
yses, for ancestry, BMI and pack-years of smoking at assessment,
BMI at age 18, and latitude at age 15. At that premenopausal
time point, only a subset of women had assessments, as the first
postmenopausal time point was often the first time point of
inclusion in the NHS.
Finally, we assessed whether our findings in the women with
MS were reflective of the broader NHS cohort. Of the 101,732
women with no MS, 31,935 had a first menopausal assessment
fitting the criteria outlined above. In this sample, we repeated
the regression analysis that we performed for the participants with
MS (omitting MS-related variables). We also examined whether
an interaction between HT use and MS diagnosis was signifi-
cantly associated with PF10 in this model, adjusting for age, men-
opausal type, and time since menopause.
RESULTS Demographic and disease characteristics of
participants. From a pool of 248 MS cases, 95 met all
criteria for inclusion in this study (figure e-1). The
participants included in this study had lower rates
of smoking, and of bilateral oophorectomy, than
the individuals not included, and slightly more lived
in the South at age 15 (table e-1).
The characteristics of the 95 participants included
in the current study are presented in table 1. At the
first time point after menopause, HT users were of
similar age at study entry as nonusers. HT users had
shorter MS duration at the time of assessment. They
did not differ in their BMI, smoking history, or sup-
plemental vitamin D intake.
Association between HT and QOL measures. Average
PF10 scores were higher in HT users (55.4) than in
non–HT users (35.4) at their first postmenopausal
PF10 assessment, adjusting for age, MS duration,
and menopausal type and duration indicating that
HT users had better physical function than non–
HT users (table 2 and figure 1A). Only ancestry
appeared to confound this association; however, the
positive association between HT use and PF10 re-
mained significant (HT: 56.5 vs no HT: 33.4, p 5
0.004) (table e-2). When we stratified by menopausal
type, these differences remained significant in the 60
women with natural menopause (HT: 56.0 vs no
HT: 31.2, p 5 0.008; adjusted for age, MS duration,
menopausal duration, and ancestry). Results were also
similar when we restricted the analysis to participants
with definite MS (HT: 52.0 vs no HT: 31.0, adjusted
p 5 0.019).
In addition, HT duration when measured continu-
ously, was also associated with higher PF10 scores (p 5
0.02 in the age-adjusted analysis and p 5 0.06 in the
analysis adjusted for age, MS duration, and meno-
pausal type and duration) (table 2). Duration of HT
use also showed the same direction of correlation with
SF-36 PCS in the subset of women with values avail-
able, but the association was not significant (p 5 0.13).
We found no association between HT use and any
other SF-36 measures (table e-2).
We further sought to determine whether the
observed association between HT use and improved
PF10 could be attributed to HT use itself or to un-
captured health-related behaviors (beyond physical
activity, BMI, smoking, or vitamin D supplementa-
tion included in our adjusted models). A subset of
28 women had a premenopausal PF10 assessment
during which they were not using HT. Here, in this
restricted cohort, the adjusted means for the group of
women who went on to use HT post menopause
(n 5 7, 63.2) was higher than for the group of
women who did not use HT post menopause (n 5
21, 40.3), but the difference was not statistically sig-
nificant (p 5 0.18, adjusting for age, MS duration,
and menopausal type; figure 1B).

 Association between HT use and QOL in women without
MS. Finally, we assessed whether HT use was also sig-
nificantly associated with higher PF10 scores in the
broader NHS cohort of 31,935 women without an
MS diagnosis, who otherwise fit our inclusion criteria.
In this cohort, in a fully adjusted model with all cova-
riates, HT use was associated with significantly lower
PF10 scores than was no-HT use (adjusted means 5
85.9 and 86.7, respectively; p 5 0.0003 [table e-3]);
however, the magnitude of this difference was only
0.8 units, with the low p value being driven by
the large increase in sample size. In fact, when we
added each covariate sequentially into the model, it
was inclusion of BMI that resulted in a positive
association between HT use and PF10 becoming
negative. Finally, when we also included the women
with MS, the interaction term between MS diagnosis
and HT use was also significant (estimate 5 17.3,
p , 0.0001, adjusting for age and menopausal type
and duration).
DISCUSSION Given the evidence for hormonal reg-
ulation in MS, here we hypothesized that exogenous
postmenopausal HT use would mitigate the effect of
MS on neurologic deterioration, as measured primar-
ily by physical decline. In our primary analysis, HT
use was associated with significantly better patient-
reported physical functioning scores.

 In MS, a disease characterized by both neuroin-
flammatory
and
neurodegenerative
components,
there is an age-related increase in disability and con-
version to progressive course observed at approxi-
mately age 45 years, while the incidence of new
inflammatory symptoms or lesions diminishes.2 Ini-
tial studies have suggested that there may be a wors-
ening of MS-related disability after menopause,3,4 but
further studies are needed.
Little is known about potential modulatory effects
of exogenous hormones in MS. Overall, estrogens
have been implicated in both shifts in immunomodu-
lation in MS as well as purported neuroprotective ef-
fects.19 Oral contraceptives, in observational studies,
have been reported to have protective,20–22 neu-
tral,23,24 and negative effects on MS risk and
course25–27; of note, the composition (estrogen and/or
progestogen) and dosing may have varied according to
the relevant study epochs, with potentially differing
effects on risk. In addition, treatment with estriol (an
estrogen markedly elevated during pregnancy, and
that at lower doses has been used as HT in Europe
and Asia28) for 24 months was recently reported to
have beneficial effects on relapses and patient-
reported fatigue.29 Given variable effects of exoge-
nous hormones noted on MS course, the current
study showing no apparent negative effects of HT
use is reassuring.
Regarding HT specifically, in healthy women, in
the decade since the Women’s Health Initiative
Memory Study raised concerns for an increased risk
of stroke or cognitive decline in women starting HT
at an older age,30 including in women in the NHS,16
a perimenopausal “window of opportunity” has been
implicated, during which exogenous hormones may
be protective against cognitive decline5–7 but beyond
which treatment may be neutral or harmful.5,30–33
Given safety concerns, few women who are currently
perimenopausal are treated with HT,30 limiting the
power of recent or ongoing observational evaluations.
In a recent clinical MS cohort study of longitudinal
changes in the EDSS through the menopausal tran-
sition, less than 20% of patients were treated with
HT.3,4
The PF10 was selected as our a priori primary out-
come because of the following facts: it had the most
available observations, it uncovers deficits in MS that
reduce QOL,34 and in a prior study, it appeared to
decline in women with MS relative to men at approx-
imately the age of 50.35 The mean PF10 values in this
cohort of postmenopausal women with MS are in line
with those reported in several other assessments of
individuals with MS34 and, specifically, in a cohort
of women aged 54 to 60 years with MS (mean 45
years, SD 12).35 In separate cohorts, the PF10 sub-
scale, which is patient-reported, has been shown to be
decreased in fully ambulatory patients with MS13 and
to have a good correlation with the EDSS across
a range of EDSS scores.15 Furthermore, for a given
EDSS score, absolute values and relative changes in
PF10 are predictive of subsequent decline in the
EDSS,15,36 suggesting that this test is sensitive to early
patient detection of changes in physical function.
Other SF-36 measures have not shown such reliable
correlation with the EDSS and are influenced by fac-
tors other than physical disability, such as patient
adaptations and coping with disease.36
In women without an MS diagnosis, HT was asso-
ciated with slightly, but significantly, worse PF10
scores. This finding, and the significant interaction
term between MS diagnosis and HT use, could be
interpreted that the risks and benefits of HT in
patient cohorts must be weighed carefully, and that
in women with high risk of neurologic (including
cognitive) deterioration, such as women with MS in
the era before disease-modifying therapy, the poten-
tial benefits of HT may offset the risks to a greater
extent than in women who are not at high risk of
neurologic deterioration. Another interpretation is
that an uncaptured bias in our MS sample belies
causality. Women with physical disabilities are less
likely to receive non–MS-related preventive care,37,38
and here, physical disability may have mitigated
women’s access to therapies seen as helpful, even
when other predictors of health care utilization (edu-
cation, profession, access) were similar across this
cohort. We sought to partially address this by com-
paring QOL at a pre-HT, premenopausal time point,
and the higher, but not statistically significant, PF10
score in premenopausal women who went on to use

 HT post menopause supports the possibility that
women with less physical disability were more likely
to take HT. Therefore, causality could not be estab-
lished in this observational study, underscoring the
importance of randomized clinical trials.
The strength of the current study includes a well-
defined and validated MS cohort, as well as a large pro-
portion of MS women treated with HT. In addition,
we adjusted for other covariates that might influence
MS risk and course, such as BMI, smoking, or vitamin
D levels.39 Study limitations include a small sample size
overall, reliance on patient-reported scores of physical
function (EDSS not available in NHS), lack of infor-
mation on timing of clinical MS attacks, lack of details
regarding specific HT formulations, and the fact that
vitamin D levels were estimated from vitamin D
intake. Even though we adjusted for MS duration, it
is possible that there was residual confounding given
the longer MS duration in non–HT users. In addition,
because physical disability accumulates with MS, it was
not possible to fully separate the effects of volitional
physical activity on physical function in women limited
by their MS-related disability.
In this cohort of women with MS at risk of
ongoing neurodegeneration, we report a positive rela-
tionship between HT use at menopause and patient-
reported physical function. While the current find-
ings do not permit a thorough assessment of causality,
they suggest that HT is not harmful in women with
MS. Furthermore, future interventional studies may
be required to assess the protective effect of HT on
neurodegeneration in MS, given the low prevalence
of HT use in current observational cohorts.
