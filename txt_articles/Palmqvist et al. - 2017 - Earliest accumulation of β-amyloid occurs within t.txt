It is not known exactly where amyloid-β (Aβ) fibrils begin to accumulate in individuals with
Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Recently, we showed that abnormal levels of Aβ42 in cere-
brospinal fluid (CSF) can be detected before abnormal amyloid can be detected using PET in
individuals with preclinical AD. Using these approaches, here we identify the earliest pre-
clinical AD stage in subjects from the ADNI and BioFINDER cohorts. We show that Aβ
accumulation preferentially starts in the precuneus, medial orbitofrontal, and posterior cin-
gulate cortices, i.e., several of the core regions of the default mode network (DMN). This
early pattern of Aβ accumulation is already evident in individuals with normal Aβ42 in the
CSF and normal amyloid PET who subsequently convert to having abnormal CSF Aβ42. The
earliest Aβ accumulation is further associated with hypoconnectivity within the DMN and
between the DMN and the frontoparietal network, but not with brain atrophy or glucose
hypometabolism. Our results suggest that Aβ fibrils start to accumulate predominantly within
certain parts of the DMN in preclinical AD and already then affect brain connectivity.

 A
ccumulation of aggregated amyloid-β (Aβ) in the brain is
believed to be the first pathological mechanism of Alz-
heimer’s disease (AD)1. Previous studies have shown that
cerebral deposition of Aβ fibrils can occur for decades before an
individual with AD reaches the dementia stage2. The widespread
cerebral
distribution
of
Aβ
in
later
AD
stages
is
well-
established3, 4, however it has been difficult to accurately iden-
tify the initial brain regions of Aβ accumulation due to the long
time-lag between the start of the pathophysiology and onset of
symptoms.
A neuropathological staging of different Aβ phases in AD has
been proposed based on post-mortem examinations and it has
been shown that the first phase is characterized by Aβ deposits
throughout the frontal, parietal, temporal, and occipital neo-
cortex5. Studies employing positron emission tomography (PET)
to visualize fibrillar Aβ deposits have also attempted to identify
early Aβ-accumulating regions. For example, when analyzing the
earliest data from AD mutation-carriers, most cortical areas
except for the sensorimotor cortex showed Aβ accumulation as
early as 15 years before the expected onset of symptoms6. A
shortcoming of such studies is the cross-sectional design, which
precludes conclusions about longitudinal events. Another issue is
that it has previously been difficult to identify the earliest pre-
clinical AD cases; when mixing such cases with later asympto-
matic AD cases that have been accumulating Aβ fibrils for years,
the cortical sites of accumulation of Aβ identified are widespread.
In the present study, we applied a novel methodology of
combining data obtained regarding Aβ levels in the brain via
PET, and levels of the Aβ42 peptide in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF),
to identify individuals who have just recently started to accu-
mulate Aβ in the brain. Previous cross-sectional studies indicate
that Aβ42 levels decrease in the CSF as Aβ starts to accumulate,
before fibrillar plaques can be detected with PET7–11. Recently,
this was confirmed longitudinally in a cohort of more than 400
non-demented individuals where we found that those with
abnormally low CSF levels of Aβ42, but with still normal Aβ
levels detected by PET (CSF+/PET−), accumulated Aβ fibrils
longitudinally at a similar rate as those who had both abnormal
CSF levels of Aβ42 and abnormal levels of Aβ detected by PET
(CSF+/PET+) and four times higher than those with normal
biomarker results on both parameters (CSF−/PET−)12. This
indicates that individuals with AD may first be defined as being
CSF+/PET−, and then progress to CSF+/PET+. It might therefore
be possible to identify the earliest stages of preclinical AD by

 studying individuals with abnormal CSF Aβ42 and normal Aβ
PET (CSF+/PET−, also referred to as early Aβ accumulators to
indicate their stage in the accumulation of Aβ).
The main hypothesis in the present study was that Aβ fibrils
are more prone to start aggregating in certain regions of the
brain before they can be found throughout the neocortex, and
before
neurodegeneration
is
present.
Identifying
these
regions and examining their properties can provide important
information about why Aβ aggregation starts in sporadic AD,
which is a crucial step for developing disease-modifying drugs.
The aim of the study was therefore to identify such regions
by comparing the longitudinal fibrillar Aβ deposition rates
in different brain regions of early Aβ accumulators (termed
CSF+/PET−) with non-accumulators (termed CSF−/PET−). To
avoid bias from non-optimal cut-offs for CSF Aβ42 levels, we also
examined the correlation between continuous CSF Aβ42 levels
and the regional Aβ PET signal in PET negative subjects. We
performed the analyses in 68 predefined anatomical regions as
well as employing voxelwise statistics. The analyses were per-
formed both in a main cohort and an independent validation
cohort. As the main cohort, we used the North American Alz-
heimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and included
all non-demented participants with CSF Aβ42 and longitudinal
Aβ PET data (473 individuals). The Swedish BioFINDER study
was used as the validation cohort, from which we included all
non-demented participants with baseline CSF Aβ42 and Aβ PET
data (406 individuals).
We also examined early regional Aβ accumulation in the
presumably earliest Aβ accumulators; those with normal CSF
Aβ42 and normal Aβ PET at baseline who converted to abnormal
CSF Aβ42 levels at follow-up but still had a normal Aβ levels
identified by PET scan (CSF−/PET to CSF+/PET−). Consistently,
using different cohorts and methods, we identified a specific set of
early Aβ-accumulating regions, which largely corresponded to a
functional brain network, the default mode network (DMN). The
relationship between early stage Aβ accumulation and whole-
brain functional connectivity was examined in detail and revealed
that hypoconnectivity, especially within the DMN and between
DMN and the frontoparietal network, was associated with low
CSF Aβ42 levels in individuals that still had normal Aβ PET
scans.
To test the hypothesis that early Aβ accumulation is an
upstream mechanism that precedes overtly decreased energy
metabolism and cell death, we compared the longitudinal changes
in 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET and volumetric magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) in the different groups. Finally, we
examined the validity of using CSF/PET groups to stratify Aβ
stages by comparing early (CSF+/PET−) and late (CSF+/PET+)
accumulators to identify known late regions of Aβ accumulation,
including the sensorimotor cortex.
Results
Experimental outline and baseline characteristics. We first
analyzed the longitudinal results from the ADNI cohort, then
replicated the result in the BioFINDER cohort and finally ana-
lyzed functional connectivity in BioFINDER.
Baseline characteristics of the ADNI sample and the different
CSF/PET groups are provided in Table 1. Early stage Aβ
accumulators (CSF+/PET−) had significantly higher prevalence
of the APOE ε4 genotype and a slightly higher neocortical
florbetapir standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR), but similar
baseline cognition, hippocampal volume, and CSF tau levels as
non-accumulators (CSF−/PET−) (Table 1). By contrast, the non-
demented late stage Aβ accumulators (CSF+/PET+) showed, at
baseline, signs of neurodegeneration with hippocampal atrophy,
higher CSF tau levels and worse cognition, and had per definition
significantly increased florbetapir SUVRs (Table 1).
Identifying early Aβ-accumulating regions. To identify early Aβ
accumulation regions, longitudinal voxelwise comparisons of
accumulation rates (SUVR/year) were performed between CSF
+/PET− (early Aβ accumulators) and CSF−/PET− (non-accu-
mulators). The results are shown in Fig. 1a (see Supplementary
Fig. 1 for whole-brain axial images). The brain regions showing
significant increases in Aβ PET signal over time in CSF+/PET−
cases included the medial orbitofrontal cortex, anterior cingulate
cortex, posterior, and isthmus cingulate cortex, precuneus and to
a lesser extent temporal regions. Similar significant regions were
identified by correlating CSF Aβ42 levels with the accumulation
rates in PET− subjects to remove potential biases from the Aβ42
cut-off
(Fig.
1b).

Fig. 1 Regions of Aβ accumulation from longitudinal voxelwise analyses in ADNI. a shows the regions where Aβ fibrils start to accumulate by comparing the
annual florbetapir SUVR rate during 2 years between early stage Aβ accumulators (CSF+/PET−, n = 59) and non-accumulators (CSF−/PET−, n = 218). The
lateral and medial projections in a show that the most significantly increased accumulation rate among the early Aβ accumulators was located in the
posterior cingulate cortex, the precuneus, and the medial orbitofrontal cortex. A PET-data-derived ROI of these early-accumulating Aβ regions is available
at http://biofinder.se b confirms the regions in a without biases from a specific CSF Aβ42 cut-off. Here, we performed voxelwise correlations between
annual florbetapir SUVR rates and CSF Aβ42 levels in Aβ PET negative individuals (n = 277). To contrast the early stage Aβ regions, c shows the regions
with significantly increased annual SUVR rate in late stage Aβ accumulators (CSF+/PET+, n = 191) compared with non-accumulators (CSF−/PET−). A
widespread pattern of Aβ accumulation is seen in these non-demented CSF+/PET+ subjects. Voxelwise two-sample t-tests were used and all analyses in
a–c are adjusted for age and gender. The significant threshold was set at p < 0.001. The red and yellow colors illustrate significant t values according to the

 comparisons, 15 of 68 cortical regions had an increased rate in the
CSF+/PET− subjects compared to the CSF−/PET− subjects
(Table 2 and Supplementary Movie 1). The significant differences
were in agreement with the voxelwise analyses and were mainly
seen in the orbitofrontal cortex, precuneus, insula, and the pos-
terior/isthmus cingulate cortex. On average the yearly Aβ accu-
mulation rate of the CSF+/PET− group was ~4–5 times that of
the CSF−/PET− group in the significant brain regions (Table 2).
All results were corrected for multiple comparisons and adjusted
for gender, age, and time between PET scans. To account for
atrophy as a confounding factor, we also adjusted all significant
models for the annual change in cortical thickness of each ROI.
After this adjustment, all 15 regions still differed significantly
between the two groups. The 15 early Aβ regions were also sig-
nificant when adjusting for diagnosis (MCI or healthy control).
Finally, we adjusted for APOE genotype to examine if different
early Aβ patterns were observed depending on whether one
carried an APOE ε4 allele, but the same regions as in Table 2 were
found (details shown in Supplementary Table 1). The distinct
pattern of early Aβ accumulation (Fig. 1a, b, Table 2) can be
contrasted to the more global Aβ accumulation pattern seen in
late, but still non-demented, Aβ accumulators (CSF+/PET+)
compared with non-accumulators (CSF−/PET−) (Fig. 1c).
Early Aβ accumulating regions in CSF converters. Previous
studies have found that non-demented CSF−/PET− individuals,
that during follow-up show abnormal CSF Aβ42 levels, might
represent the earliest preclinical AD phase13, 14. We therefore
examined CSF−/PET− subjects who, after 2 years, converted to
CSF+/PET− (referred to as CSF converters). In the ADNI cohort
there were 112 CSF−/PET− subjects with longitudinal CSF data
that could be included in this analysis. At follow-up investigation,
11 of these 112 subjects had converted to abnormal CSF Aβ42
levels (CSF+/PET−) while 101 subjects remained stable with
normal CSF Aβ42 levels (CSF−/PET−). Significant differences in
Aβ accumulation rate (Aβ PET SUVR/year) between the two
groups were seen in the left posterior cingulate and right medial
orbitofrontal cortex (p = 0.02–0.03). The group comparisons were
still significant after adjustment of age, gender, and time between
PET scans, but probably because of the limited statistical power
(n = 11) there were no significant differences after multiple
comparison correction. Given the agreement with the previously
identified regions (Fig. 1a, b and Table 2), we interpreted the
identified regions as true and not a statistical type 1 error. For the
CSF converters, the SUVR increased significantly with mean rates
of +2.3–2.5% per year in the left posterior cingulate cortex and
the right medial orbitofrontal cortex. No significant increase was
seen in these regions among the non-converters and the corre-
sponding mean rates were +0.3% (95% CI −0.24 to +0.90%) and
+0.3% (95% CI −0.7 to +1.2%).
Aβ accumulation and functional brain networks. The regional
distribution of the early accumulation of cortical Aβ fibrils
(Fig. 1a, b) resembled the brain regions involved in the DMN.
This led us to examine early accumulation of Aβ fibrils within the
different functional brain networks. We applied the early accu-
mulation regions from Fig. 1a to a functional connectivity net-
work atlas15 in order to determine the involvement of the
different networks in early Aβ accumulation. Figure 2 shows that
early Aβ accumulation predominantly overlapped with the DMN
(Jaccard coefficient, JC, 0.14), but also with the frontoparietal
network (JC 0.07). The networks that were the least involved in
early Aβ accumulation were the sensorimotor (JC 0.01) and visual
networks (JC 0.01).
Validation of our Aβ staging by identifying late Aβ regions.
We have used the CSF+/PET− subjects as a proxy for early stage
Aβ accumulators and compared them with CSF−/PET− subjects
(non-accumulators) to identify early Aβ regions. If our CSF/PET
groups are valid for staging Aβ phases, we should also be able to
compare early Aβ accumulators and CSF+/PET+ subjects (our
proxy for late stage Aβ accumulators) to identify known regions
of late Aβ accumulation. The results from the ROI-based com-
parisons are shown in Table 3 and Supplementary Movie 2. The
largest differences were seen in the precentral, postcentral,
paracentral, pericalcarine, and lingual regions. This means that
our proxy group for late Aβ accumulation (CSF+/PET+) had a
higher accumulation rate of the Aβ PET signal over time com-
pared with early Aβ accumulators (CSF+/PET−) around the
sensorimotor cortex and occipital lobe. Note that these sig-
nificant, late Aβ regions did not overlap with the early Aβ regions
(compare
Tables
2
and
3).

Atrophy and glucose metabolism in relation to Aβ accumula-
tion. To test the hypothesis that atrophy, as a marker of neuronal
and synaptic degeneration, starts after the initiation of Aβ accu-
mulation, we compared the longitudinal change in gray matter
(GM) volumes between the CSF/PET groups using voxel-based
morphometry (VBM) analysis (Fig. 4a, b and Supplementary
Fig. 2A). No clear atrophy pattern was seen in early Aβ
accumulators (CSF+/PET−) compared with non-accumulators
(CSF−/PET−) (Fig. 4a). In contrast, late Aβ accumulators
(CSF+/PET+) exhibited the expected longitudinal atrophy pattern
of over time involving mainly temporoparietal regions when
comparing them to non-accumulators (Fig. 4b) and early Aβ
accumulators (Supplementary Fig. 2A). Similar analyses were
made with longitudinal FDG PET data to examine changes in
glucose metabolism in relation to early Aβ accumulation. There
were no differences in FDG uptake over time between non-
accumulators (CSF−/PET−) and early Aβ accumulators (CSF
+/PET−) (Fig. 4c), while a cortical metabolic reduction in the
temporal lobe was seen in late Aβ accumulators (CSF+/PET+)
compared with non-accumulators (CSF−/PET−) (Fig. 4d) and
early Aβ accumulators (CSF+/PET−) (Supplementary Fig. 2B).
Replication of the early Aβ regions in the BioFINDER cohort.
To test the generalizability of our results we replicated the early
Aβ accumulation regions in the BioFINDER cohort. Only cross-
sectional data was available from the BioFINDER study. Although
longitudinal comparisons are preferred given our hypothesis,
regional differences in Aβ deposition should still be noticeable
when comparing CSF+/PET− and CSF−/PET− subjects cross-
sectionally. A strength of this cohort is that another Aβ PET
ligand (18F -flutemetamol) as well as another immunoassay for
CSF Aβ (INNOTEST) were used, and the results would therefore
be more generalizable if they were replicable in this cohort. The
characteristics of BioFINDER is provided in Supplementary
Table 2. Similar early Aβ accumulation regions were identified as
in ADNI when comparing cross-sectional
18F-flutemetamol
SUVRs between CSF+/PET− and CSF−/PET− subjects using
ROI-based analyses in BioFINDER (Supplementary Table 3). The
most significant regions were found in the orbitofrontal cortex,
the posterior cingulate cortex, and the precuneus (Supplementary
Table 3, which can be compared with ADNI data in Table 2).
Further, the cross-sectional voxelwise comparisons between CSF
+/PET− and CSF−/PET− subjects in BioFINDER showed sig-
nificant changes predominantly in the orbitofrontal cortex and
posterior cingulate similar to the longitudinal analyses in ADNI
(Fig. 5, compare with ADNI data in Fig. 1a, b).

 levels of CSF Aβ42 with whole-brain connectivity (Fig. 6). The
groups of interest were the early Aβ accumulators (CSF+/PET−)
and biomarker normal individuals with close to abnormal CSF
Aβ42 (CSF-low/PET−). In the CSF+/PET− group we found a
significant network component where reduced connectivity was
associated with decreasing levels of CSF Aβ42. The component
predominantly consisted of intra-DMN links, but also links
between the DMN and the frontoparietal network (Fig. 6a). The
summed connectivity on the significant correlation component
changed most drastically when CSF Aβ42 levels were closer to the
cut-off (400–516 ng/L for the INNOTEST ELISA) and seemed to
reach a floor effect as Aβ42 reached levels of around 350 ng/L.
Figure 6c depicts the intra-DMN links, which dominate the sig-
nificant hypoconnectivity component correlating with lower CSF
Aβ42 values in the early Aβ accumulators. Furthermore, a sig-
nificant network component involving the DMN was associated
with CSF Aβ42 in the CSF-low/PET− group, but with fewer
constituent links (Fig. 6b). Interestingly, the correlation was in the
opposite direction showing an increased connectivity as CSF
Aβ42 levels dropped from normal levels towards the abnormal
cut-off. In summary, Fig. 6 indicates that when CSF Aβ42 levels
drop within the near abnormal range they might be associated
with an increased connectivity in connections involving the
DMN. Then, when CSF Aβ42 levels become abnormal and
decrease further as Aβ accumulates, they are instead clearly
associated with a decreased connectivity within the DMN and
mainly between the DMN and the frontoparietal network. The
associations with hypoconnectivity and hyperconnectivity were
similar when adjusting for CSF P-tau and T-tau, indicating the
independent effect of Aβ on the connectivity (Supplementary
Fig. 3).
Discussion
This study examined where Aβ fibrils are more prone to start
accumulating, by comparing the longitudinal outcome of non-
demented subjects with early signs of Aβ accumulation (CSF
+/PET−) to those with no measurable signs of Aβ accumulation
(CSF−/PET−), in a large cohort of 473 subjects. The results
showed significantly increased rates of Aβ fibril accumulation
predominantly in the precuneus, posterior cingulate cortex, and
orbitofrontal cortex in this early Aβ stage. When examining
subjects with even earlier signs of Aβ accumulation (CSF−/PET−
subjects who converted to CSF+/PET− within 2 years), sig-
nificantly increased Aβ fibril accumulation rate was again seen in
the medial orbitofrontal and posterior cingulate cortex, compared
with stable CSF−/PET− subjects. These regions were replicated in
an independent cohort (n = 406). To our knowledge, this is the

 first study to identify a group of early stage Aβ accumulators and
detect increased Aβ accumulation rates specifically in these
regions using longitudinal data. Previous longitudinal studies
have either failed to detect an early increase in regional Aβ
deposition16 or identified a rather large early stage Aβ region
including the posterior temporal, inferior parietal, posterior cin-
gulate, precuneus, and occipital areas4. Those previous results
indicate that there might have been methodological issues in
correctly identifying the preclinical AD cases who have just
started to accumulate Aβ.
There are a few previous studies where cross-sectional results
have been used to approximate early stage Aβ accumulation
regions. In a subanalysis of a study aimed to identify different Aβ
PET cut-offs, voxelwise comparisons were made between a
reference group with very low Aβ PET SUVR (n = 22) and several
groups of subjects (n = 22 in each group) with increasingly higher
global SUVRs17. They found that the first significant SUVR dif-
ferences between the controls and a group with sub-threshold
SUVRs were located in the medial frontal cortex and the pre-
cuneus, similar to our early Aβ regions. Another cross-sectional
study
used
a
different
methodology
to
approximate
the
cortical spread of Aβ in 67 healthy controls and 128 patients with
MCI or AD dementia18. By assuming that earlier regions would
show increased Aβ PET signal in a greater number of subjects,
they found an initial Aβ region involving the areas in Fig. 1a, but
also affecting middle and inferior temporal regions, and superior
and
middle
frontal
regions.
In
neuropathological
studies,
the results are mixed. One study reported that the presumably
first Aβ phase had Aβ deposits throughout the neocortex5, while a
prior publication by Braak & Braak19 showed an early pattern
of Aβ deposits in the basal parts of the medial and anterior
regions
of
the
prefrontal
cortex,
and
the
basal
anterior
temporal lobe. The differences are probably partly explained by
the different staining methods and their affinity to different Aβ
forms (discussed in the methodological aspects below). A clear
advantage of the present study is that longitudinal Aβ changes in
the whole brain has been analyzed, instead of cross-sectional
examinations in predetermined regions as in neuropathological
studies.
The early Aβ regions we identified were mainly located within
the DMN (Fig. 2). The DMN has a core network located in the
posterior cingulate cortex, precuneus, and medial prefrontal
cortex20. It is almost always active, but increasingly so during
daydreaming, activation of episodic memory and other internally
directed activities and decreasingly during task-based activities
and interaction with the external environment21, 22. A certain
overlap between the DMN and the distribution of Aβ fibrils in
AD has also been noted in previous publications23–26. The cause
of Aβ aggregation within the DMN is currently unknown. One
explanation is that the deposition of Aβ fibrils could be caused by
the high neuronal activity within the DMN, which is supported
by animal studies showing that Aβ secretion and deposition is
enhanced by neuronal activity27–29. An alternative explanation is
that Aβ accumulation is caused by the high metabolic demand
and metabolic stress in these neurons (high energy consumption

 and frequent fluctuations in activation and deactivation) and
not the neuronal activation per se30. Although the core DMN
was the most prominent network that we found that had ana-
tomical overlap with the early Aβ regions, we want to point out
that involvement of other networks was also evident in the
early Aβ accumulation, especially the frontoparietal network
(Fig. 2). This indicates that early stage accumulation is not related
to a unique feature of the DMN, but in a more general
sense to hubs in the brain with high connectivity. This inter-
pretation is supported by previous studies showing an association
between Aβ distribution and several networks and network
hubs25, 31, 32.
The association between functional networks and earliest
stages of Aβ accumulation was further examined using functional
connectivity analyses in BioFINDER. When we correlated whole-
brain functional connectivity and CSF Aβ42 levels in the early
stage Aβ accumulators (CSF+/PET−), we found a decreased
connectivity in intra-DMN connections and between DMN and
the frontoparietal network as CSF Aβ42 decreased (Fig. 6a). The
disruption of these connections in BioFINDER is especially
interesting given the distribution of early Aβ fibrils in ADNI in
the DMN and frontoparietal networks (Fig. 2). This correlation
between the disruption of functional connectivity and Aβ
pathology has recently been described in AD32, 33, but to our
knowledge the present study is the first to show that this asso-
ciation is present already at the very earliest preclinical stages of
AD when Aβ fibrils are just starting to accumulate. In our second
connectivity analysis (Fig. 6b) we examined the correlation
between functional connectivity and CSF Aβ42 in those with
indications of very early Aβ accumulation (close to abnormal CSF
Aβ42 and normal Aβ PET; CSF-low/PET−). The results indicate
that when Aβ42 drops towards abnormal levels in the CSF the
connectivity instead increases in similar DMN-related connec-
tions in which there was a positive correlation between decreased
connectivity and decreasing levels of CSF Aβ42 within the
abnormal Aβ42 range (compare connectograms in Fig. 4a, b).
Interpretations of this preliminary finding are speculative, but it
might be that cortical hubs like the medial frontal lobe and
posterior cingulate exhibit increased activity before Aβ fibril-
containing senile plaques are formed in preclinical AD. This is
supported by experimental cell and animal work suggesting that
neural
activity
leads
to
increased
Aβ
generation
and
secretion27, 34. Later, the hypoconnectivity might develop when
Aβ fibrils starts accumulating and causes neuronal dysfunction.
Alternatively, early and soluble Aβ oligomers might instead
trigger the initial hyperactivity, which is supported by studies in

Fig. 6 Association between functional connectivity and early Aβ accumulation in BioFINDER. a and b show CSF Aβ42 correlations with whole-brain resting-
state fMRI connectivity in non-demented subjects with normal Aβ PET and QC-passed fMRI data (n = 103). Nodes were grouped into the 7 networks and
2 subcortical regions in the connectograms (a and b). The connectograms show that the significant network component associated with CSF Aβ42 was
qualitatively similar for the CSF+/PET− (a) and CSF-low/PET− (b) groups and consisted mostly of intra- and inter-DM connections. Intra-DM dominated
and the strongest inter-DM connection was with the frontoparietal network. The network component of the CSF+/PET− group exhibited reduced
connectivity with decreasing CSF Aβ42 (a), r = 0.91, p < 0.001. By contrast, in the qualitatively similar network component of the CSF-low/PET− group,
decreasing Aβ42 was instead associated with increased connectivity (b), r = −0.85, p < 0.001. Panel c shows the dominating intra DM-reduction in
connectivity for the CSF+/PET− group (a). In summary, a show that Aβ accumulation measured with CSF Aβ42 in early Aβ accumulators is associated with
hypoconnectivity in intra- and inter-DM network links. b instead shows that in a population including subjects with even earlier indications of Aβ
accumulation (CSF-low/PET−) Aβ accumulation is instead associated with hyperconnectivity in similar neuronal connections. Correlation coefficients (r)
refer to Spearman correlation between summed connectivity and CSF Aβ42 levels. Age, gender, and APOE ε4 status was controlled for by partial
correlation. Network components correlating with CSF Aβ42 were calculated using a method similar to the NBS algorithm (see “Methods for the

 transgenic AD models suggesting that neurons become hyper-
active very early, independently of the deposition of Aβ into
plaques, and that the silencing of neurons emerges only later in
the disease course35.
Although altered functional connectivity was found already in
the early Aβ accumulators (CSF+/PET−), our longitudinal ana-
lyses (Fig. 4a, c) showed that no changes in glucose metabolism or
atrophy were present at this stage. However, decreased tempor-
oparietal glucose metabolism and atrophy was observed in the
late Aβ accumulators (CSF+/PET+; Fig. 4b, d and Supplementary
Fig. 2A, B). This finding can have practical implications for the
enrollment in anti-Aβ clinical trials since anti-Aβ agents should
be introduced after Aβ accumulation has started but before
neurodegeneration is present. This should make CSF+/PET−
subjects suitable for inclusion in clinical trials, especially if the
drug is intended to target Aβ accumulation over long time peri-
ods using AD biomarkers as outcomes of its efficacy in this
preclinical disease stage.
The temporal sequence of Aβ accumulation preceding neuro-
degeneration confirms the most acknowledged hypothetical
model on the development of AD1. It also strengthens the
rationale for using CSF/PET groups as proxies for Aβ stages in
AD. To further validate the use of CSF/PET groups, we compared
Aβ accumulation in our proxy group for early Aβ accumulation
(CSF+/PET−) with the proxy group for late Aβ accumulation
(CSF+/PET+). As hypothesized, we identified known regions of
late
stage
Aβ
accumulation,
including
the
sensorimotor
cortex and occipital lobe (Fig. 3, Supplementary Movie 2 and
Table 3)3, 19. In a recent study, we also showed that CSF+/PET−
subjects accumulated Aβ at a similar rate as CSF+/PET+ subjects
and about four times higher than CSF−/PET− subjects12. The
high accumulation rate in CSF+/PET− subjects was not accom-
panied by cognitive decline, but we found a subtle decline in
memory over 5 years in CSF+/PET+ subjects that further vali-
dates the use of CSF/PET groups for stratifying Aβ stages.
Nonetheless, we acknowledge that CSF+/PET− subjects are not all
early Aβ accumulators since this state also can be caused by CSF
analytical factors, failed PET scans, and medical conditions other
than AD36–38.
As part of our methodology we chose to primarily compare
longitudinal changes between the CSF/PET groups instead of
comparing cross-sectional values or just within-group changes to
the identify the early Aβ regions. This had the advantage of
accounting for physiological differences in Aβ burden, age-related
non-specific Aβ accumulation rates, and the fact that the indi-
viduals within each CSF/PET stage had reached slightly different
time points in the disease progression. In addition, the early Aβ-
accumulating brain regions remained significant when adjusting
for confounding factors such as longitudinal changes in cortical
thickness, APOE genotype and clinical status. These adjustments
show that the results were not confounded by differences in
atrophy between the groups or differences between healthy con-
trols and MCI subjects (discussed further in the Methods section).
It should be noted that the early Aβ regions are derived from
group analyses, which show where Aβ is prone to start accu-
mulating but they do not exclude the possibility that the accu-
mulation might start in other regions in some individuals.
A limitation of our early Aβ regions is that they have been
identified using PET ligands that bind to primarily dense-core Aβ
aggregates and to a lesser extent or not at all to diffuse
plaques39, 40. We can therefore not pinpoint the exact Aβ forms
within the early Aβ regions, neither can we say if Aβ aggregates
not detected by PET are present in other areas of the brain at this
early stage. Future PET ligands that binds to different forms, e.g.,
Aβ protofibrils, might reveal a different early Aβ pattern41. The
binding affinity of current PET ligands could explain some of the
differences with neuropathological studies that either use silver
technique19, which stain not only Aβ but also tau, or anti-Aβ
antibodies5 that bind to specific Aβ epitopes and stain different
Aβ forms. Nonetheless, a strength of the methodology is that we
could detect similar early Aβ regions in two different cohorts
using two different types of PET ligands; 18F-florbetapir (a stil-
bene compound) and 18F-flutemetamol (an 18F-labeled analog of
11C-Pittsburgh Compound B (PiB) derived from thioflavin T)40.
The cut-offs for the two PET ligands were established separately
in each cohort, and the data were not pooled in the analyses, nor
were the groups compared to each other. We therefore chose to
not transform SUVR into a standardized scale such as centiloid
units42.
To conclude, we believe that the identified early Aβ regions can
have several important implications. These brain regions give a
pathophysiological insight into where Aβ fibril accumulation is
prone to start in AD and its relationship to functional networks
and their connectivity. Our data indicated that Aβ starts accu-
mulating before overt metabolic changes or atrophy, and that
hypoconnectivity within the early Aβ-accumulating regions has
already occurred when Aβ fibrils just starts to accumulate. The
most prominent early Aβ-accumulating regions were the pre-
cuneus, posterior cingulate cortex, and the medial orbitofrontal
cortex, possibly with an overlap to the anterior cingulate. Based
on our results, future studies should be able to examine early
unique pathophysiological events and triggering mechanisms of
Aβ accumulation by comparing molecular and physiological
properties
of
the
early-accumulating
regions
to
later-
accumulating regions. These early-accumulating Aβ regions
should also be advantageous to use in an Aβ PET composite ROI
to better assess early fibrillar Aβ deposition (available at http://
biofinder.se), which can have practical implications for early AD
diagnostics, Aβ staging and enrollment in clinical trials that target
Aβ accumulation.
Methods
Study data. Longitudinal data from the ADNI were used for all the statistical
analyses in the study, except for replicating the finding of early Aβ accumulating
regions and for the functional connectivity analyses for which data from the
Swedish BioFINDER study were used. The methodology described in the next
sections refers only to analyses performed in the ADNI cohort. Methodology
referring to analyses in the BioFINDER cohort is described separately under
Methods for the BioFINDER study.
Participants. Only non-demented individuals were included in this study (char-
acterized as either cognitively normal or diagnosed with mild cognitive impair-
ment, MCI). Demented subjects were excluded since the study aim was to identify
early AD pathology. We chose to include MCI subjects in addition to healthy
controls since the cognitive impairment did not necessarily have to be caused by an
underlying AD process and because about a third of MCI subjects have shown to
be incorrectly diagnosed with cognitive impairment43–45. We also attempted to
include a range of different pre-dementia AD phases for a better staging of late Aβ
accumulators, early Aβ accumulators and non-accumulators. To account for this
inclusion the models were adjusted for clinical status (MCI/healthy control) in
subanalyses. The specific inclusion/exclusion criteria for the ADNI cohort can be
found at http://www.adni-info.org. Briefly, all subjects were enrolled from the
ADNI-2 study, were between the ages of 55 and 90 years, were fluent in Spanish or
English, had completed at least six years of education, had a Mini-Mental State
Examination score (MMSE) of ≥2446, and were free of any significant neurologic
disease other than AD. Subjects classified as cognitively normal (n = 176) had a
Clinical Dementia Rating scale (CDR) score of 047. MCI (n = 297) was defined as
having preserved activities of daily living, absence of dementia, and an objective
cognitive impairment as shown on the delayed recall test of the Wechsler Memory
Scale - Logical Memory II as well as a CDR score of 0.5. Only subjects with a
complete set of baseline and follow-up Aβ PET scans and baseline CSF Aβ42 data
were included. Our study baseline was defined as the first visit where both CSF and
PET data were available. Study subjects gave written informed consent and the
study was approved by each participating site’s Institutional Review Board.

weighted images were acquired for volumetric measures, anatomical segmentation,

Fibrillar Aβ pathology was measured using the PET ligand 18F-florbetapir. Image
data were acquired 50–70 minutes post-injection (see http://adni.loni.usc.edu/wp-
content/uploads/2010/05/ADNI2_PET_Tech_Manual_0142011.pdf). Glucose
metabolism was measured employing FDG PET with images acquired 30–60 min
post-injection. Florbetapir PET, FDG PET, and MR images from baseline and the
2-year follow-up visit were downloaded from the LONI database (http://ida.loni.
usc.edu) and further processed locally. Longitudinal 18F-florbetapir was available in
all subjects, longitudinal MRI in 468 subjects (218 CSF−/PET−, 59 CSF+/PET−, and
191 CSF+/PET+), and longitudinal FDG PET in 318 subjects (153 CSF−/PET−,
41 CSF+/PET−, and 124 CSF+/PET+).
Image processing. The motion corrected PET data was time-averaged and rigidly
aligned with the anatomical MRI scan. SUVR were then calculated by normalizing
to averages of appropriate reference regions. For florbetapir, the reference region
consisted of the whole cerebellum, the pons/brainstem region, and eroded cortical
white matter as this composite region has produced more reliable results in
longitudinal analyses49. For FDG, a composite region comprising vermis/cere-
bellum superior to the horizontal fissure and pons were used as reference region50.
Freesurfer version 5.3 (http://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu; Desikan-Killiany Atlas)
segmentations of the structural MR images were applied to extract SUVRs from 68
predefined ROIs. Partial volume error (PVE) correction was performed for flor-
betapir SUVRs with the geometric transfer matrix (GTM) method51 using Free-
surfer segmented regions52 (all florbetapir results shown in the tables and figures
are from PVE corrected data).
The MRI volumes were further normalized to MNI152 standard space53 using a
nonlinear diffeomorphic transformation54 enabling motion and PVE voxelwise55
corrected SUVRs to be transformed to MNI standard space for voxelwise analyses.
VBM as implemented in Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM) version 12
(Wellcome Department of Cognitive Neurology, London, UK; http://www.fil.ion.
ucl.ac.uk/spm) was used to evaluate GM intensity as a measure of atrophy. All
individual T1-weighted MR images were segmented into tissue classes using SPM’s
unified segmentation algorithm. The GM segmentations were subsequently warped
into a common MNI152 standard space using a cohort-specific template and the
SPM Diffeomorphic Anatomical Registration Through Exponentiated Lie Algebra
(DARTEL) toolbox and Jacobian scaled to estimate GM intensity. The resulting
maps were smoothed with 8 mm full-width at half maximum (FWHM) Gaussian
kernel. Intracranial volume (ICV) was calculated by summating the volumes of
GM, white matter, and CSF based on the SPM tissue segmentations. Using the
corrected SUVRs in standardized space, we also proceeded to calculate summed
values within the functional MRI (fMRI) resting-state networks enumerated in the
low resolution atlases with seven networks calculated by Yeo et al. (see details
below)15.
Florbetapir and FDG PET images were co-registered to their respective MRI
and subsequently warped into a common MNI152 space using the transformation
information derived from warping the MRI scans. To assess changes over time in
GM intensity (MRI), amyloid accumulation (florbetapir PET), and glucose
metabolism (FDG PET) between baseline and follow-up examinations, parametric
change maps were created. For longitudinal VBM, a midpoint average MRI was
created for each subject based on the baseline and follow-up images using SPM12,
resulting in Jacobian determinant maps showing local volumetric change between
baseline and follow-up for each subject. Midpoint average images were GM-
segmented and subsequently used to create a DARTEL template that was affine-
transformed to the common MNI152 space. Midpoint average GM segmentations
were multiplied by the Jacobian maps to create individual GM change maps, which
were warped to the MNI-transformed DARTEL template and smoothed by an
8 mm FWHM isotropic Gaussian kernel to create longitudinal change maps. A GM
mask was created using the same approach as for the cross-sectional data (see
above). The florbetapir and FDG change maps were created using the warped
images and FSL (http://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk) according to the equation

CSF biomarkers. CSF Aβ42, total tau (T-tau), and tau phosphorylated at Thr181
(P-tau) were measured using the multiplex xMAP Luminex platform (Luminex
Corp, Austin, TX, USA) with the INNOBIA AlzBio3 kit (Innogenetics, Ghent,
Belgium)56, 57. Data was combined from the available online files “UPENN-
BIOMK8.csv”, “UPENNBIOMK7.csv, “UPENNBIOMK6_07_02_13.csv”, and
“UPENNBIOMK5_10_31_13.csv”. Only cross-sectional CSF data from baseline
were used in the analyses (n = 473), except for the analysis of “CSF converters”
where longitudinal 2-year data was used (n = 112). In the case of one subject with
stable Aβ42 levels, only 3-year follow-up data was available. The mean difference
between baseline CSF sampling and the florbetapir PET scan was 9.6 days (ranging
from 0 to 110 days).
Group classifications. All subjects were categorized into different groups
according to their CSF Aβ42 and Aβ PET status. The following groups were
derived from the baseline results: (1) normal CSF Aβ42 and Aβ PET (CSF−/PET−)
referred to as non-accumulators (n = 218), (2) abnormal CSF Aβ42 and normal Aβ
PET (CSF+/PET−) referred to as early Aβ accumulators (n = 59), and (3) abnormal
CSF Aβ42 and Aβ PET (CSF+/PET+) referred to as late Aβ accumulators
(n = 191). Those with normal CSF Aβ42 and abnormal Aβ PET were not used in
any analysis (n = 5). Abnormal CSF Aβ42 values were defined using the previously
established cut-off of <192 ng/L57–59. The cut-off for abnormal Aβ PET SUVR was
determined using a mixture modeling analysis since no previous cut-off had been
established for PVE corrected florbetapir data in ADNI (using the GTM method).
Mixture modeling statistics provide an unbiased threshold for abnormality (i.e., the
diagnosis or status is not used in analysis) and it is a well-established method for
defining Aβ PET cut-offs12, 17, 60, 61. To achieve a robust threshold we derived the
cut-off from a larger ADNI sample (n = 663, all non-demented subjects with CSF
and Aβ PET data). This resulted in a cut-off of >0.872 SUVR for an abnormal Aβ
PET using PVE correction and the composite reference region.
Methods for the BioFINDER study. The Swedish BioFINDER study was used for
replicating the main results from ADNI and for the functional connectivity ana-
lyses. BioFINDER is a prospective study that focuses on identifying key mechan-
isms and improvement of diagnostics in AD and other neurodegenerative
disorders. For details about study design, methods, and specific inclusion/exclusion
criteria, see http://biofinder.se. The study was approved by the ethical review board
in Lund, Sweden, and all participants gave their written informed consent. All non-
demented individuals with CSF and Aβ PET data were selected for this study. This
resulted in a cohort consisting of cognitively healthy elderly subjects (n = 138) and
consecutively recruited patients who had been referred to memory clinics due to
cognitive complaints (n = 268). The PET ligand 18F-flutemetamol was used for Aβ
PET, and images were acquired 90–110 min post-injection. The PET scanning
procedures have been described previously60. CSF Aβ42 and P-tau were analyzed
with INNOTEST ELISAs (Fujirebio Europe, Ghent, Belgium) and T-tau with
EUROIMMUN ELISAs (EUROIMMUN AG, Lübeck, Germany) as previously
described60, 62. Mixture modeling was performed in the sample to determine the
cut-offs for abnormal CSF Aβ42 (<517 ng/L) and abnormal Aβ PET (>0.759
SUVR). Only baseline data was available for analysis in the BioFINDER cohort.
Imaging was performed on a 3 Tesla Siemens Tim Trio scanner (Siemens
Medical Solutions, Erlangen, Germany). The high-resolution 3D T1-weighted
volume used for segmentation and normalization was acquired using an MPRAGE
sequence (in-plane resolution = 1 × 1 mm2, slice thickness = 1.2 mm, TR =
1950 ms, TE = 3.37 ms, flip-angle = 9°). Spontaneous BOLD oscillations in the
absence of external stimuli were imaged with a gradient-echo planar sequence (eyes
closed, in-plane resolution = 3 × 3 mm2, slice thickness = 3mm, TR = 2000 ms,
TE = 30 ms, flip-angle = 90°, 180 dynamic scans, 6 min).
Resting-state data preprocessing was performed with a pipeline composed of
FSL63, AFNI64, and ANTS65. Anatomical processing involved skull stripping,
segmentation of white matter (WM)/GM/CSF and normalization to MNI152-
space53. Dropping the first five frames in anticipation of steady state, functional
data was bulk motion, and slice timing corrected, furthermore nuisance regressed
using the WM/CSF average signal, 6 components of physiological noise66, 24
motion parameters67, and linear/quadratic trends. Finally, the functional data was
transformed to MNI space. Frames causing outliers in total frame-to-frame signal
variation were censored, on average constituting 4% of the fMRI series68. The
signal was band-pass filtered to 0.01–0.1 Hz, further discriminating against scanner
drift and physiological noise. No spatial smoothing was applied.
Subjects with a mean/maximum frame-wise displacement29, 69 exceeding 0.6/
3.0 mm were excluded. As an extra precautionary step, the voxel-to-voxel BOLD-
signal correlations across the whole brain (including GM, WM, and CSF) was
calculated and summed. Outliers in this measure likely originate in a motion-
induced global signal confound capable of eluding conventional motion
estimation70 and were removed.
The processed fMRI data was resampled using trilinear interpolation to 6 × 6 ×
6 mm3 resolution and masked with GM derived from a cortical resting-state
network atlas71 and Harvard-Oxford subcortical atlas72. Fisher-z transformed
Pearson correlation between the resulting 5071 GM voxel time series then yielded a
measure of functional connectivity (FC), corresponding to a weighted graph with
nodes (voxels) and links (voxel BOLD time series correlations).
Network components correlating with CSF Aβ42 were calculated using a
method similar to the NBS algorithm73. We calculated the largest network
component C (defined as a connected set of links), for which rij > r0, where rij is the
Spearman correlation over all subjects between CSF Aβ42 and zij for the link
between voxel i and j (Fisher z-transformed voxel BOLD time-series correlation),
and r0 controls the component size and significance level of constituent links. We
chose r0 corresponding to approximately p = 0.001 given the number of subjects in
the calculation. Component size was then defined as the sum of all rijϵC multiplied
by the Spearman correlation of the sum of all z-values in the component and CSF
levels. This last step allows for reasonable and natural variations on the extracted
component. The component size was compared to a permutation-generated null
distribution of sizes, thus controlling for the family-wise error rate in the weak
sense at α = 0.05 The result of the algorithm is a network component on which
sum of z-scores correlates significantly higher than for randomized sets of subject
FC-CSF pairs. Age, gender and APOE ε4 status was controlled for by partial
correlation.
In order to simplify the analysis of network components, we grouped nodes
using a resting-state network atlas71 containing: default mode, dorsal and ventral

 attention, sensory motor, visual, fronto-parietal, and fronto-temporal (medial
temporal lobe/orbitofrontal cortex). To this set of labels we added two anatomically
defined subcortical structures from the Harvard-Oxford atlas72: the Basal Ganglia
(BG: thalamus, caudate, putamen and pallidum) and hippocampus/amygdala (HI).
Note that the permutation-based approach generates p values for the network
component as a whole, but since these are too large and complex to visualize, a
network-based break up is necessary.
Only Aβ PET negative subjects were used in the connectivity analysis. In
addition to the previously described group of early Aβ accumulators (CSF+/PET−,
n = 23 after fMRI quality control) we also defined a group of biomarker negative
subjects with indications of very early Aβ accumulation (n = 80). Those with low
levels of CSF Aβ42, but still within the normal range, have a high risk of becoming
abnormal within the next couple of years13, which suggests that sub-threshold CSF
Aβ42 levels indicate very early Aβ accumulation. This group was characterized as
Aβ PET negative with CSF Aβ42 between 517–750 μg/mL (CSF−low/PET−).
Statistical analysis. Group comparisons of baseline characteristics (Table 1 and
Supplementary Table 2) was performed with Mann–Whitney U statistics if sig-
nificant after the Kruskal–Wallis test. For ROI analyses, full factorial general linear
models were used to analyze group differences and correlations of the 68 available
cortical Freesurfer ROIs from the Desikan-Killiany Atlas. The dependent variable
was Aβ accumulation rate ([SUVR at follow-up – SUVR at baseline]/years between
baseline and follow-up) in ADNI and baseline Aβ PET SUVR in BioFINDER. The
variance of the SUVRs were similar in each group. All results were adjusted for
gender and age and, in the longitudinal analyses, time between Aβ PET exam-
inations. We also performed additional analyses adjusting for changes in cortical
thickness over 2 years in each ROI and clinical status (healthy control/MCI) in
addition to the above covariates. Longitudinal changes within a specific group of
subjects were analyzed with the Paired T-test. Because of the limited number of
subjects in the subanalysis of “CSF converters” (n = 11), we primarily used non-
parametric statistics for this subgroup (the Mann–Whitney U and Wilcoxon signed
rank test). To control for multiple testing in the ROI-based analyses we used the
Benjamini–Hochberg procedure with a conservative false discovery rate (FDR) of
0.05 (not to be confused with a p value of 0.05)74. Original p values are presented
for the ROI-based analyses but are only reported as significant if they are sig-
nificant after the FDR correction. The effect size of the significant results when
comparing the CSF/PET groups are given in % annual increase of SUVR (yearly
SUVR change divided by SUVR at baseline) for an easier comparison between
different PET ligands and brain regions (and when comparing the results to other
studies that use different reference regions). However, statistical significances were
determined using actual SUVR or SUVR/year data. SPM12 was used for all vox-
elwise analyses. We employed voxelwise two-sample t-test and multiple regressions
using age, gender, and ICV (for analyses involving VBM data) as covariates. All
images had been transformed into common MNI space by using transformation
measures from warping the co-registered MRI scans to the 2 mm MNI152 MRI
template and smoothed with an 8 mm FWHM kernel. The resulting t-maps were
thresholded to present results with a p < 0.001 height, uncorrected for family-wise
error, and a k > 100 voxels cluster extent. For the resting-state correlation analysis,
a component (consisting a connected set of links correlating with CSF biomarker
levels above a p = 0.001 threshold) was assigned a p value as a whole based on the
component size relative a permutation-generated null distribution, thus correcting
for family-wise cerror in the weak sense (see “Methods for the BioFINDER study”
for details). Finite mixture models for establishing biomarker cut-offs were per-
formed with the package “mixtools” in R version 3.2.2 (R Foundation for Statistical
Computing, Vienna, Austria, 2013). FDR correction of multiple comparisons was
performed using the Benjamini–Hochberg formula in an Excel sheet (Microsoft
Excel for Mac, 2011, version 14.4). All other statistical analyses were performed
with SPSS for Mac, version 22.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL).
Data availability. MRI and PET images were downloaded online at https://ida.
loni.usc.edu and further processed locally (see Image Processing above). All other
ADNI data were also downloaded from the same site. BioFINDER data and pro-
cessed ADNI data are not publicly available for download, but might be retrieved
from the principal investigator Oskar Hansson. A PET-data-derived ROI of the
early-accumulating Aβ regions (Fig. 1a) is available in MNI152 space and Nifti-
format at http://biofinder.se.
