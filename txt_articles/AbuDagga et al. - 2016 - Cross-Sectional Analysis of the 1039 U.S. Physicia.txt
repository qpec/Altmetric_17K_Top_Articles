Abstract
Background
Little information exists on U.S. physicians who have been disciplined with licensure or
restriction-of-clinical-privileges actions or have had malpractice payments because of sex-
ual misconduct. Our objectives were to: (1) determine the number of these physicians and
compare their age groups’ distribution with that of the general U.S. physician population; (2)
compare the type of disciplinary actions taken against these physicians with actions taken
against physicians disciplined for other offenses; (3) compare the characteristics and type
of injury among victims of these physicians with those of victims in reports for physicians
with other offenses in malpractice-payment reports; and (4) determine the percentages of
physicians with clinical-privileges or malpractice-payment reports due to sexual misconduct
who were not disciplined by medical boards.
Methods and Results
We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of physician reports submitted to the National
Practitioner Data Bank (NPDB) from January 1, 2003, through September 30, 2013. A total
of 1039 physicians had � 1 sexual-misconduct–related reports. The majority (75.6%) had
only licensure reports, and 90.1% were 40 or older. For victims in malpractice-payment
reports, 87.4% were female, and “emotional injury only” was the predominant type of injury.
We found a higher percentage of serious licensure actions and clinical-privileges revoca-
tions in sexual-misconduct–related reports than in reports for other offenses (89.0% vs
68.1%, P = < .001, and 29.3% vs 18.8%, P = .002, respectively). Seventy percent of the phy-
sicians with a clinical-privileges or malpractice-payment report due to sexual misconduct
were not disciplined by medical boards for this problem.

 Conclusions
A small number of physicians were reported to the NPDB because of sexual misconduct. It
is concerning that a majority of the physicians with a clinical-privileges action or malprac-
tice-payment report due to sexual misconduct were not disciplined by medical boards for
this unethical behavior.
Introduction
Physician sexual misconduct dangerously exploits the physician-patient relationship. This behav-
ior “may be verbal or physical, and may include expressions of thoughts and feelings or gestures
that are sexual or that reasonably may be construed by a patient or patient’s surrogate as sexual”
[1]. The long-standing prohibition against sexual relations with patients goes back to the Hippo-
cratic oath in the fourth century BC: “I will come for the benefit of the sick, remaining free of . . .
sexual relationships with both female and male persons” [2]. The Council on Ethical and Judicial
Affairs for the American Medical Association determined it is unethical for a physician to have a
romantic relationship or sexual contact with a current patient and that a sexual relationship with
a former patient is also unethical if the physician “uses or exploits trust, knowledge, emotions, or
influence” derived from the prior physician-patient relationship [3].
Although this prohibition on physician-patient sexual relations is based on evidence that
such relations harm patients and endanger their medical care [4–9], physician sexual miscon-
duct has received inadequate attention from researchers [10]. Two recent studies [11,12] exam-
ined, in part, physician sexual misconduct among Canadian physicians, but no such U.S.
national-level analyses have been published on this important public health problem since
Public Citizen’s 1998 study, limited to medical board licensure actions [13].
To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to examine physician sexual misconduct in
the U.S. using the National Practitioner Data Bank (NPDB)—the only national repository of
legally required reports subject to accuracy review concerning disciplinary actions by state medi-
cal boards or clinical peer review committees, or malpractice payments resulting from physician
wrongdoing [14]. Although the Federation of State Medical Boards compiles information on
physician licensure disciplinary actions [15], only the NPDB collects comprehensive information
on peer reviewed clinical-privileges disciplinary actions and malpractice payments in addition to
licensure actions [16]. Therefore, the NPDB provides the only comprehensive and definitive data
available on sexual misconduct in the context of disciplined physicians in the U.S.
This study aimed to: (1) determine the number of these physicians and compare their age
groups’ distribution with that of the general U.S. physician population; (2) compare the type of dis-
ciplinary actions taken against these physicians with actions taken against physicians disciplined
for other offenses; (3) compare the characteristics and type of injury among victims of these physi-
cians with those of victims in reports for physicians with other offenses in malpractice-payment
reports; and (4) determine the percentages of physicians with clinical-privileges or malpractice-
payment reports due to sexual misconduct who were not disciplined by medical boards.
Material and Methods
Design and Data Sources
This study was a retrospective cross-sectional analysis of de-identified physician data from the
NPDB’s public-use file, published by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services [17].

have no financial competing interests. AA, SMW, and
MC are employees of Public Citizen, a Washington,
D.C.-based nonprofit consumer advocacy
organization that has long worked on issues related
to medical board oversight and physician
accountability. Thus, these authors may be seen to
have an intellectual competing interest. REO has no
competing interests and received no compensation
from Public Citizen for work on this paper, but he
would like to disclose that he was Associate Director
for Research and Dispute of the Data Banks before
his retirement in 2008. In that capacity he designed
the public-use NPDB file used in this study.
 A national database established under the Health Care Quality Improvement Act of 1986 [18],
the NPDB includes reports of (a) all adverse licensure actions taken against physicians by state
medical boards (referred to hereafter as “licensure reports”); (b) adverse restriction-of-clinical-
privileges actions lasting more than 30 days taken against physicians by clinical peer review
committees in hospitals, nursing homes, etc., including similar panel membership actions
taken by managed care organizations (referred to hereafter as “clinical-privileges reports”); and
(c) all malpractice payments made on behalf of physicians (referred to hereafter as “malprac-
tice-payment reports”) [16]. Notably, the three report types have some variables in common
(such as physician age groups), but differ with respect to the other variables as described in
later parts of our methods section.
Although most of our analyses were at the report level, we conducted physician-level analy-
ses for the number of sexual-misconduct–related report types and physician age groups. Com-
parisons of sexual-misconduct–related reports with reports related to other offenses were
conducted for the type of disciplinary action for licensure and clinical-privileges reports, as
well as for victim characteristics and the type of victim injury for malpractice-payment reports
only.
We also compared physicians with sexual-misconduct–related reports with the general U.S.
physician population (using data from the Federation of State Medical Boards) [19] with
respect to age groups (Supplemental Methods in S1 File).
Physician Report Selection Criteria
As noted earlier, the NPDB receives reports of disciplinary actions taken by state medical
boards or clinical peer review committees and malpractice payments made on behalf of physi-
cians by malpractice insurance companies or others. The NPDB itself takes no action and
makes no findings. It simply receives reports and disseminates them to those authorized to
receive the information. The NPDB has made explicit sexual-misconduct codes available for
use in licensure and clinical-privileges reports since September 2002 and in malpractice-pay-
ment reports since January 2004 [20]. When our study was initiated, the NPDB file included
data through September 30, 2013. Therefore, our study period for licensure and clinical-privi-
leges reports was from January 1, 2003, and for malpractice-payment reports from January 1,
2004, through September 30, 2013.
We identified all sexual-misconduct–related licensure, clinical-privileges, and malpractice-
payment reports (Supplemental Methods in S1 File) for all physicians, including M.D., D.O.,
and intern/resident physicians during the study period. We also identified all reports for other
physicians for whom the reported basis for disciplinary action involved offenses other than sex-
ual misconduct during the study period (note: we excluded reports in which no basis for action
was reported). We used these other-offenses–related physician reports to perform comparisons
with physician sexual-misconduct–related reports.
Physician and Victim Characteristics
All three report types included physician age group. For sexual-misconduct physician-level
analyses we used age group as reported in the earliest sexual-misconduct–related report during
the study period. We categorized age groups as under 40, 40 to 49, 50 to 59, 60 or older, and
unknown. Only malpractice-payment reports had information about victim age group (which
we categorized as 1 to 20, 20 to 39, 40 to 59, or 60 to 79 years, or unknown), sex, and setting
(categorized as outpatient, inpatient, both inpatient and outpatient, or unknown).

 Physician Licensure Disciplinary Actions
For licensure reports, we examined the reported types of disciplinary action taken by the medi-
cal boards. Because each licensure report may list up to five licensure disciplinary actions, we
calculated the number of reports that included each of these actions, regardless of the order in
which they were listed. We further reported the number of reports that included serious versus
nonserious licensure actions. We defined a serious licensure action based on the presence of
any of the following 11 licensure actions: “revocation of license,” “probation of license,” “sus-
pension of license,” “summary/emergency limitation/restriction on license,” “summary/emer-
gency suspension of license,” “voluntary surrender of license,” “limitation or restriction on
license/practice,” “denial of license (renewal only),” “voluntary agreement to refrain or suspend
pending completion of investigation,” “denial of initial license,” and “voluntary limitation/
restriction of license.” We defined a nonserious licensure action based on the absence of a seri-
ous action in the report and the presence of at least one of the following four actions: “repri-
mand or censure of license,” “publicly available fine/money penalty (licensure),” “publicly
available negative action/finding,” and “other licensure action (not classified).”
Physician Clinical-Privileges Disciplinary Actions
For clinical-privileges reports, we examined the reported types of disciplinary action taken by
clinical peer review committees. Similar to licensure reports, clinical-privileges reports may list
up to five adverse actions. Nine different types of adverse actions were found in the reports
analyzed in our study: “revocation of clinical privileges/panel membership,” “professional
review employment or panel membership firing,” “voluntary surrender of clinical privileges/
panel membership under investigation,” “involuntary resignation/panel membership,” “denial
of clinical privileges,” “suspension of clinical privileges/panel membership,” “summary/emer-
gency suspension of clinical privileges/panel membership,” “limitation/restriction of proce-
dures/practice area” and “other restriction/limitation of clinical privileges.” We calculated the
number of reports that included each of these clinical-privileges actions, regardless of the order
in which they were listed in each report. We considered all reported clinical-privileges actions
to be serious because nonserious clinical-privileges actions—those limiting the ability of a phy-
sician to practice at the reporting entity to 30 days or less—are not reported to the NPDB.
Type of Victim Injuries in Malpractice-Payment Reports
For malpractice-payment reports, we examined the reported type of injury suffered by the
patient. This variable was available only in malpractice-payment reports. Each of these reports
listed only one of the following possible 10 types of injuries: “emotional injury only;” “death;”
“significant permanent injury;” “major permanent injury;” “major temporary injury;” “quadri-
plegic, brain damage, lifelong care;” “insignificant injury;” “minor temporary injury;” “minor
permanent injury;” or “cannot be determined.”
Statistical Analysis
Descriptive analyses included frequencies and percentages for study variables. Two-sample
two-tailed z-tests were conducted to test differences in age groups’ distributions between physi-
cians with sexual-misconduct reports and the general U.S. physician population. Chi-square or
Fisher exact tests were used to test differences in the disciplinary actions against physicians,
victim characteristics, and type of victim injury between sexual-misconduct–related reports
and physician reports related to other offenses. A significance level of .05 was used for all com-
parisons. Data were analyzed using SAS version 9.3 (SAS Institute, Inc, Cary, NC).

 Results
Of 100 165 unique physicians with licensure, clinical-privileges, or malpractice-payment
reports in the NPDB during the study period, 1039 had one or more sexual-misconduct–
related reports (accounting for approximately 1% of the total physicians with one or more of
any NPDB reports). Most of these 1039 physicians had only sexual-misconduct–related licen-
sure reports (75.6%) (Table 1). Physicians with only clinical-privileges or malpractice-payment
reports accounted for 8.9% and 7.9% of the 1039 physicians, respectively. The remaining 79
(7.6%) physicians had sexual-misconduct reports in two or more of these report types. More-
over, 12.9% of the physicians with sexual-misconduct–related reports had multiple reports of
the same type, with licensure reports being the most common report type among these physi-
cians (see Table 1 for more details).
Physician Characteristics
There were statistically significant differences in the proportions of most age groups for physi-
cians with sexual-misconduct–related reports compared with those for the general U.S. physi-
cian population: 9.6% of physicians with sexual-misconduct–related reports vs 23.3% for the
U.S. physician population were aged 20 to 39 (P < .001); 28.6% vs 24.9% were aged 40 to 49
(P = .006); and 35.2% vs 24.8% were aged 50 to 59 (P < .001) (Table 2). Thus, there were signif-
icantly more physicians aged 40 to 49 and 50 to 59 with sexual-misconduct–related reports and
fewer 20- to 39-year-old physicians with sexual-misconduct–related reports than represented
by those age groups in the general physician population.

 Victim Characteristics in Malpractice-Payment Reports
For malpractice-payment reports, there were 167 sexual-misconduct–related reports submitted
for 128 physicians, accounting for a tiny proportion (.2%) of the total 110 738 physician reports
during the study period. As shown in Table 3, the proportion of victims between 20 and 39 years
of age in sexual-misconduct–related reports was double that for the same-aged victims in mal-
practice-payment reports related to other offenses (46.1% vs 22.6%, P < .001). Conversely, the
proportion of victims 60 and older was approximately one-seventh as high in sexual-miscon-
duct–related reports as in reports related to other offenses (3.0% vs 21.9%, P < .001). The propor-
tions of victims under 20 and those between 40 and 59 years of age for sexual-misconduct–
related reports and reports related to other offenses were not significantly different. The propor-
tion of females listed as victims in sexual-misconduct–related reports was significantly greater
than that in malpractice-payment reports related to other offenses (87.4% vs 54.6%, P < .001).
The majority of sexual-misconduct–related malpractice-payment reports concerned inci-
dents in the outpatient setting, and this proportion was significantly greater than that for mal-
practice-payment reports related to other offenses (83.8% vs 39.5%, P < .001). Conversely, far
fewer sexual-misconduct–related malpractice-payment reports concerned incidents in the
inpatient setting compared with malpractice-payment reports related to other offenses (8.4%
vs 44.9%, P < .001). Smaller proportions of sexual-misconduct reports concerned both inpa-
tient and outpatient setting in both report types (3.0% and 9.1% in sexual-misconduct and mal-
practice-payment reports related to other offenses, respectively, P = .01).
Reported Physician Licensure Disciplinary Actions
Only 974 (2.9%) of the total 33 637 physician licensure reports during the study period were
sexual-misconduct–related. Overall, serious licensure actions made up a greater proportion of
the disciplinary actions taken in sexual-misconduct–related licensure reports compared with
licensure reports related to other offenses (89.0% vs 68.1%, P < .001) (Table 4). Of all major
types of serious licensure actions, license suspension was noted in 22.9% of sexual-miscon-
duct–related reports compared with 16.0% of reports related to other offenses (P < .001).
License revocation was the second-most-frequent serious licensure action in sexual-miscon-
duct–related reports, representing a significantly greater proportion compared with reports
related to other offenses (16.2% vs 7.6%, P < .001). Additionally, summary/emergency license
suspension and license/practice limitation or restriction were noted in higher proportions of

 sexual-misconduct–related reports compared with reports related to other offenses (13.7% vs
4.9%, P < .001; and 10.5% vs 7.6%, P = .001, respectively). Conversely, nonserious licensure
actions of reprimand or censure and of publicly available negative action or finding were noted

related to other offenses (13.9% vs 26.3%, P < .001; and .2% vs 1.1%, P = .01, respectively).
Reported Physician Clinical-Privileges Disciplinary Actions
Only 140 (2.1%) of all 6621 physician clinical-privileges reports during the study period were
sexual-misconduct–related (Table 5). Overall, the proportions of sexual-misconduct–related
clinical-privileges reports with revocations and with professional review employment or
firing were greater than those of reports related to other offenses (29.3% vs 18.8%, P < .002;

 and 6.4% vs 1.5%, P < .001, respectively). Denial of clinical privileges was noted in a lower pro-
portion of sexual-misconduct–related reports, compared with reports related to other offenses
(2.9% vs 8.4%, P = .02). Involuntary resignations were noted in 1.4% of sexual-misconduct–
related reports, compared with .3% of reports related to other offenses (P = .02).
Reported Type of Victim Injury in Malpractice-Payment Reports
“Emotional injury only” accounted for a significantly higher proportion of victim injuries in sex-
ual-misconduct–related malpractice-payment reports than in reports related to other offenses
(82.0% vs 1.5%, P < .001) (Table 3). In contrast, the proportions of victims reported to have died
or sustained a type of major, significant, or permanent injury in sexual-misconduct–related reports
were significantly lower than those in malpractice-payment reports related to other offenses.

 licensure reports—ie, they were not disciplined for sexual misconduct by medical boards
(Table 1). Of those 177 physicians, 92 (52.0%) had only clinical-privileges reports, 82 (46.3%)
had only malpractice-payment reports, and three (1.7%) had both clinical-privileges and mal-
practice-payment reports related to sexual misconduct.
Discussion
This is the first analysis of data involving physician sexual misconduct in the U.S. that includes
adverse licensure and clinical-privileges restriction actions, as well as malpractice payments.
Over the 10-year period of our study, only a small number of physicians (n = 1039) were
reported to the NPDB due to sexual misconduct. Consistent with prior studies [13,21,22], we
found that a disproportionate share of physicians with sexual-misconduct reports were aged 40
or older. More specifically, physicians aged 40 to 49 and 50 to 59 accounted for a significantly
higher proportion of physicians with sexual-misconduct–related reports compared with the
proportions these age groups represent in the general U.S. physician population.
Our study also offers the first national evidence concerning physician sexual-misconduct
victims’ age, sex, and type of injury in malpractice cases that resulted in a payment being made
on behalf of a physician. Overall, significantly more sexual-misconduct victims were female,
and more than twice as many were 20 to 39 years old compared with victims in malpractice-
payment reports related to other offenses. Our findings on physician sexual misconduct and
victim characteristics can be informative to decision makers interested in focusing on these
groups of physician offenders and at-risk victims.
Although it is expected that death and major injuries are unlikely to result from sexual mis-
conduct, the fact that 82% of physician sexual-misconduct victims in malpractice-payment
reports not only were able to pursue malpractice cases but also prevailed on the basis of “emo-
tional injury only” suggests that the emotional injury was serious in these cases.

 As supported by previous research [13], our licensure report analysis shows that when med-
ical boards took disciplinary actions against physicians for sexual misconduct, their actions
were more serious than actions for other offenses. Similarly, our analysis of clinical-privileges
reports revealed higher proportions of revocations and firings in sexual-misconduct–related
reports compared with reports related to other offenses.
Our finding that more than two-thirds of the physicians with sexual-misconduct–related
clinical-privileges or malpractice-payment reports were not disciplined by any state medical
board for such conduct is concerning, because the NPDB provides medical boards with access
to all clinical-privileges and malpractice-payment reports for physicians with these reports in
their respective states. This finding is consistent with previous NPDB-based research that
showed that no medical board actions were taken against more than 50% of the physicians
who had reports of serious clinical-privileges actions because of negligence or incompetence
[23]. Therefore, there is room for medical boards to improve how they act on information
related to physician misconduct, thus better meeting their obligation to protect the public.
The limitations inherent in the nature of our data should be considered. No information on
the sex and specialty of physicians with sexual-misconduct–related reports is available in the
NPDB’s public-use file. However, previous studies showed that physicians with sexual miscon-
duct are predominantly males [21] and that psychiatrists typically account for a disproportion-
ately high share of reported cases [12,13,22], although in recent years a growing number of
cases have involved family physicians and obstetricians/gynecologists [24].
Another data limitation is that, of the three report types analyzed in this study, the NPDB
documentation explicitly refers to patient victims only in malpractice-payment reports. We
cannot state with certainty that in licensure and clinical-privileges reports the victims of sexual
misconduct were patients (rather than professional colleagues or people outside the clinical-
practice context). However, we believe, based on one author’s (REO) prior experience as an
NPDB research executive for many years, that relatively few sexual-misconduct disciplinary
actions taken by clinical peer-review committees involve victims who are not patients. Addi-
tionally, the 1998 U.S. study examining physicians with licensure actions due to sexual miscon-
duct found that victims were clearly patients in 75% of cases [13].
We also note that there is not necessarily a one-victim-to-one-report relationship for licen-
sure and clinical-privileges disciplinary reports. Complaints from multiple victims may result
in a single disciplinary action.
By far, the main limitation of our study is that it only represents physician sexual miscon-
duct that resulted in a licensure or clinical-privileges disciplinary action or a malpractice pay-
ment that was reported to the NPDB. As with other professional misconduct, not all physician
sexual misconduct behavior results in a disciplinary action or a paid malpractice claim, and
therefore not all such misconduct is captured in the NPDB. Understanding this context is criti-
cal to recognizing that our study inherently represents only the tip of the iceberg of physician
sexual misconduct in the U.S. Specifically, patients who are victims of sexual misconduct are
rarely willing to report sexual misconduct. Of patients who do file complaints against health
care providers, “nothing happened” to the alleged perpetrator in 55 percent of cases [25]. Phy-
sicians are also unwilling, in the majority of cases, to report sexual misconduct by colleagues
[26], and attorneys are typically reluctant to pursue malpractice claims with little prospect for
substantial damage awards [27], such as sexual misconduct cases which usually tend to involve
only emotional injury.
Moreover, significant variation, more than fivefold, exists among states in serious disciplin-
ary action rates [28]. Thus, vastly differing effectiveness of medical boards in investigating and
disciplining physicians, including those engaged in sexual misconduct, may be another reason
for fewer sexual-misconduct–related disciplinary actions being reported to the NPDB.

 These factors suggest that our findings may not be generalizable to all physician sexual mis-
conduct in the U.S., because they do not include cases of physician sexual misconduct not
reported to authorities or cases that did not result in a clinical-privileges disciplinary action
lasting more than 30 days or a malpractice payment. Additionally, because of the corporate-
shield loophole [29], our findings cannot be representative of physician sexual-misconduct
malpractice payments that do not name the responsible physician. This has been suggested to
lead to an underestimation in the number of paid malpractice claims by about 20 percent [30].
Finally, we note that the approach we have taken to compare physician sexual misconduct
and related victim information with all other types of physician offenses is subject to limita-
tions because of the wide heterogeneity of this “other” misconduct category.
Future research is needed to uncover the full extent of physician sexual misconduct in the
U.S. In the absence of a large-scale random sample survey of patients, the most practical source
of data might be complaints made to state licensing boards, in addition to actions taken by the
boards.
Conclusions
Our study informs policy makers, the medical community, consumers, and patient advocates
about the extent and characteristics of physicians with sexual misconduct reported to the
NPDB, the nature of sexual-misconduct–related disciplinary actions, and the characteristics of
malpractice-payment victims. We found that two-thirds of physicians with either sexual-mis-
conduct–related clinical-privileges actions or malpractice payments—both strong forms of evi-
dence that sexual misconduct actually occurred—were not disciplined for sexual misconduct
by medical boards. Therefore, we highlight the need to reform licensing-board discipline in
sexual-misconduct cases. Furthermore, the entire medical community needs to increase efforts
to prevent physician sexual misconduct and to be aggressive in reporting and disciplining phy-
sicians who engage in such misconduct. Particularly, more stringent state legislative oversight
of medical boards is warranted to ensure that all physicians who have committed sexual mis-
conduct face appropriate medical-board disciplinary actions for violating this most fundamen-
tal tenet of the physician-patient relationship.
