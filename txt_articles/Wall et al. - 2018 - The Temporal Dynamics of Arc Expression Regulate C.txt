SUMMARY
Neuronal activity regulates the transcription and
translation of the immediate-early gene Arc/Arg3.1,
a key mediator of synaptic plasticity. Proteasome-
dependent degradation of Arc tightly limits its
temporal expression, yet the significance of this
regulation remains unknown. We disrupted the tem-
poral control of Arc degradation by creating an Arc
knockin mouse (ArcKR) where the predominant Arc
ubiquitination sites were mutated. ArcKR mice had
intact spatial learning but showed specific deficits
in selecting an optimal strategy during reversal
learning. This cognitive inflexibility was coupled to
changes in Arc mRNA and protein expression result-
ing in a reduced threshold to induce mGluR-LTD and
enhanced mGluR-LTD amplitude. These findings
show that the abnormal persistence of Arc protein
limits the dynamic range of Arc signaling pathways
specifically
during
reversal
learning.
Our
work
illuminates how the precise temporal control of activ-
ity-dependent molecules, such as Arc, regulates syn-
aptic plasticity and is crucial for cognition.
INTRODUCTION
The activity-regulated protein Arc/Arg3.1 (Arc) is essential for
spatial memory acquisition and consolidation (Bramham et al.,
2008; Guzowski et al., 1999; Lyford et al., 1995; Plath et al.,
2006). Arc is required for protein-synthesis-dependent synaptic
plasticity related to learning and memory, making it one of the
key molecular players in cognition (Park et al., 2008; Shepherd
and Bear, 2011; Waung et al., 2008). Arc protein expression is
highly dynamic: increasing and then rapidly declining following
increased network activity or exposure to a novel environment
(Guzowski et al., 1999; Ramı
´rez-Amaya et al., 2005). Retrieval
of a memory also induces Arc expression which then rapidly de-
cays (Nakayama et al., 2015; Ramı
´rez-Amaya et al., 2005). The
regulation of Arc protein induction occurs at the level of mRNA
transcription, mRNA trafficking, and protein translation (Korb
and Finkbeiner, 2011). Although the importance of Arc induction
is clear, the role of Arc protein degradation in synaptic plasticity
and learning-related behaviors is still unknown.
To determine the importance of Arc removal, we generated a
mutant mouse line (ArcKR) in which ubiquitin-dependent degra-
dation of Arc is disabled. We show that ArcKR mice display
impaired cognitive flexibility that is coupled with elevated levels
of Arc protein expression, a reduced threshold to induce mGluR-
LTD, and enhanced mGluR-LTD. We further show that behav-
ioral training alters Arc mRNA expression and modulates the
magnitude of mGluR-LTD.
RESULTS
Ubiquitin-Dependent Turnover of Arc Alters AMPA
Receptor Trafficking
Arc promotes AMPA receptor (AMPAR) endocytosis following
activation of group I mGluRs with the agonist DHPG (Waung
et al., 2008). This effect is reduced by overexpression of
Triad3A/RNF216, which targets Arc for degradation. Conversely,
Triad3A/RNF216 depletion increases Arc levels, thus enhancing
AMPAR endocytosis (Mabb et al., 2014a). We recorded mEPSCs
in neurons expressing short hairpin RNA (shRNA) directed
against Triad3A/RNF216 (Figure S1A). Depletion of Triad3A/
RNF216 significantly (p = 0.026, Figure S1A) enhanced DHPG-
dependent reduction in AMPAR-mediated mEPSC amplitude

 within 2–3 min compared to neurons expressing a scram-
bled shRNA.
Triad3A/RNF216 and Ube3A E3 ligases ubiquitinate Arc on
lysines 268 and 269, targeting Arc for proteasome-mediated
degradation (Greer et al., 2010; Mabb et al., 2014a). To confirm
that ubiquitination of Arc modulates surface AMPAR expression,
we transfected hippocampal neurons with either Arc-WT, Arc-
2KR (K268/269R), or Arc-5KR (K55/136/268/269/293R) and
then stained for the surface AMPAR subunit, GluA1 (Figure S1B).
Overexpression of the Arc-KR mutants (Arc-2KR or Arc-5KR)
had comparable effects, both producing a greater decrease in
surface GluA1 expression compared to Arc-WT. Thus, a reduc-
tion in Arc protein degradation enhances GluA1 internalization
(Figure S1C) and suggests that expression of a degradation-
resistant Arc protein would augment AMPAR endocytosis
in vivo.
Enhanced mGluR-LTD in the Hippocampus of
ArcKR Mice
We next created an Arc knockin mouse (ArcKR) where lysine 268
and 269 were mutated to arginine to prevent Arc ubiquitination
(Figures S2A and S2B). ArcKR mice were born with expected
Mendelian ratios, with no differences in mortality rate or in
weight of heterozygous or homozygous ArcKR/KR (ArcKR) mice
compared to Arc+/+ (WT) littermates. There were no significant
differences in the expression of various scaffold proteins,
NMDA receptors, or AMPAR subunits in synaptosomes (Figures
S2C and S2D). Expression levels of mGluR1/5 and Arc protein
were similar in WT and ArcKR mice as was Arc mRNA (Figures
S2C–S2F). To confirm that proteasome-mediated turnover of
Arc was impaired, we monitored Arc protein levels following
addition of DHPG (100 mM, 10 min), which induces Arc transla-
tion and ubiquitination (Klein et al., 2015; Waung et al., 2008).
In WT neurons, addition of DHPG increased Arc protein, peaking
at 120 min post-induction and decaying near baseline levels at
480 min (Figure 1A). Addition of DHPG to ArcKR hippocampal
neurons resulted in persistent Arc protein elevation (Figures 1A
and 1B). To measure Arc degradation, we applied the protein
synthesis inhibitor anisomycin after DHPG to halt Arc protein
synthesis. In WT neurons, Arc levels were reduced after aniso-
mycin treatment (Figure 1C), consistent with rapid Arc degrada-
tion. In contrast, this decline was significantly blunted in ArcKR
neurons (Figure 1D), demonstrating the importance of proteaso-
mal degradation in limiting the half-life of Arc protein. We have
demonstrated that Arc ubiquitination via K48 linkages could be
elicited by pilocarpine-induced seizures in vivo (Mabb et al.,
2014a). Pilocarpine-induced seizures in WT mice resulted in an
increase in K48-linked Arc ubiquitination, an effect that was
attenuated in ArcKR mice (Figure 1E).
Consistent with the reduced surface expression of GluA1, we
observed increased GluA1 endocytosis in ArcKR neurons
treated with DHPG using a high-content AMPA receptor traf-
ficking assay (Figures 1F and 1G). Intriguingly, we found a
significant increase in the surface expression of the GluA2
subunit in ArcKR neurons, at short time points, indicating a
potential receptor subunit replacement (Figures 1H and 1I).
These findings support our previous observation that over-
expression of ArcWT in hippocampal neurons increases the
rectification index of AMPAR-mediated miniature-EPSC ampli-
tude, indicating an increase in the proportion of AMPAR-
containing GluA2 subunits (DaSilva et al., 2016; Wall and
Corre
ˆ a, 2018).
Given the increase in GluA1-containing AMPAR endocytosis
rates, we speculated that mGluR-LTD would be enhanced, as
this form of plasticity requires Arc-dependent AMPAR internali-
zation (Park et al., 2008; Waung et al., 2008). Basal synaptic
transmission and synaptic plasticity were measured in hippo-
campal slices from ArcKR and WT littermates. ArcKR mice had
unaltered basal synaptic transmission: no significant (p > 0.05)
change in paired-pulse facilitation (Figure 2A), input-output rela-
tionship (Figure 2B), or ratio of fEPSP slope to volley amplitude
(Figure 2B, inset). Thus, under basal conditions, Arc ubiquitina-
tion has little effect on synaptic AMPAR expression consistent
with no changes in protein and mRNA expression (Figures
S2C, S2D, and S2F). To investigate the role of Arc degradation
in synaptic plasticity, we induced mGluR-LTD with DHPG
(100 mM, 10 min) in hippocampal slices from ArcKR and WT litter-
mates. We observed no significant difference between geno-
types (p = 0.29) when DHPG was present. However, LTD was
significantly enhanced in ArcKR mice (55–60 min after DHPG
washout, Figures 2C and 2D). To test whether the threshold
to induce LTD is reduced in ArcKR slices, we applied a lower
concentration of DHPG (50 mM, 10 min). This lower concentra-
tion of DHPG was insufficient to induce LTD in WT mice but
was sufficient to induce LTD in slices from ArcKR mice (Figures
2E and 2F). Thus, reduction of Arc ubiquitination reduces the
threshold to induce LTD and enhances the magnitude of
mGluR-LTD.
ArcKR Mice Exhibit Cognitive Inflexibility and Reduced
Threshold to Induce mGluR-LTD
We considered whether ArcKR mice displayed behavioral defi-
cits. WT and ArcKR mice had no overt motor abnormalities,
similar anxiety levels (Figures S3A–S3F) and recognition memory
(Figures S3G–S3I).
We next explored the role of Arc ubiquitination in hippocam-
pal-dependent spatial learning by using a modified Barnes
maze (Eales et al., 2014). Mice were tested for 21 consecutive
days to test acquisition, consolidation, and expression phases
of learning (days 1–15). On day 16, the platform was rotated
180�, requiring the mice to learn a new location for the exit
hole (Figure S4A). No differences were observed in spatial acqui-
sition during days 1–15 (Figures 3A and 3B). Following 180� rota-
tion of the exit hole on day 16, there was no significant difference
in distance traveled (Figure 3A), but there was a significantly
higher number of errors (Figure 3B, reversal, p = 0.02) and selec-
tive perseverance bias (Figure 3C, p = 0.05) in ArcKR mice during
the reversal phase (days 16–21). However, there was no differ-
ence in quadrant bias ratios during the acquisition phase (Fig-
ure 3C). This suggests that ArcKR mice show impairments in per-
forming the task specifically during reversal learning. We next
examined the strategy used to search for the maze exit hole (Fig-
ure 3D; Figure S4B). Both WT and ArcKR mice showed a similar
shift from a combination of random and serial strategies to a
spatial search strategy (days 1–15; Figure 3D). However, when
the maze exit was rotated 180� (reversal learning), there were

 clear differences in the search strategy employed by WT and
ArcKR mice. On the day of reversal, WT and ArcKR mice used
similar search strategies to the first day of training (day 1) (Fig-
ures 3D and 3E; Figure S4C). However, in subsequent days,
WT mice replaced random and serial for a spatial search strategy
(as observed for the training before reversal). In contrast, ArcKR
mice only employed a serial search strategy on days 17–19
(2–3 days following reversal), before utilizing a combination of
strategies on days 20 and 21 (Figures 3D and 3E; Figure S4C).
Taken together, ArcKR mice are unable to reuse strategic ap-
proaches previously acquired during task learning, suggesting
cognitive inflexibility.

Reversal Learning Training Impacts
on mGluR-LTD
To address whether training of a spatial-
dependent task (Barnes maze) had an
impact on Arc expression and subsequent hippocampal synap-
tic plasticity, we used hippocampi of trained WT and ArcKR litter-
mates to either measure Arc mRNA and protein expression or to
measure mGluR-LTD. Compared to WT, we observed a signifi-
cantly larger decrease in the fEPSP slope during DHPG applica-
tion in slices from trained ArcKR mice (p < 0.001, Figure 3F), and
the expression of LTD was significantly increased in ArcKR slices
(Figures 3F). Consistent with the enhanced decrease in the
amplitude of fEPSPs during DHPG application, the levels of
Arc protein were also significantly increased in hippocampal ly-
sates obtained from ArcKR, but not from WT mice (Figure S4D).

 in a significant reduction in Arc mRNA (Figure 3G) with no change
in Grm5 mRNA levels (Figure 3H) compared to the first day of
training. This expression was not different between WT and
ArcKR mice, indicating that Arc mRNA dynamics are not altered
during spatial learning as has been observed in other Arc trans-
genic mouse models (Figure 3G) (Steward et al., 2018). Intrigu-
ingly, we found that reversal learning led to an increase in Arc
mRNA in ArcKR mice, suggesting delayed dynamics in Arc
mRNA induction that mirrored the learning deficits in ArcKR
mice during reversal learning (Figures 3D and 3G).
To determine the effect that Barnes maze training on basal
synaptic transmission and mGluR-LTD, we recorded interleaved
slices from trained and naive WT and ArcKR littermates (Figure 4).
Training had no effect on basal synaptic transmission in either
WT or ArcKR mice (Figure 4A). However, training significantly
reduced mGluR-LTD in both trained genotypes (Figures 4B
and 4C). This reduction was not presynaptic (no change in
paired-pulse ratios prior to and after DHPG application in trained
versus naive mice, Figure 4). In ArcKR-trained slices, there was a
decrease in fEPSP amplitude during DHPG application, an
observation that was not seen in WT mice (Figure 4B and 4C).
These findings suggest that the temporal dynamics of Arc pro-
tein expression, induced by behavioral training, modulates sub-
sequent mGluR-LTD.
DISCUSSION
Arc protein expression is exquisitely regulated by neuronal activ-
ity. Here we have determined the functional consequences of
modifying the temporal profile of Arc expression. Using a novel
mouse (ArcKR) we showed: (1) mGluR1/5-dependent induction
of Arc protein enhances GluA1-containing AMPAR endocytosis;
(2) enhanced mGluR-LTD and a reduced threshold to induce
LTD; (3) deficits in selecting strategies to perform the reversal
of a spatial learned task that is coupled to the changes in LTD;
and (4) increased Arc mRNA expression is associated with
reversal learning.
Previous studies have linked alterations of mGluR-LTD to
changes in spatial learning and task reversal (Eales et al.,
2014; Mills et al., 2014; Xu et al., 2009). Since deficits in
mGluR-LTD are associated with impairment of the acquisition/
consolidation of spatial learning and poor performance with
task reversal (Eales et al., 2014; Me
´ nard and Quirion, 2012; Xu
et al., 2009), it might be predicted that ArcKR mice, which
show enhanced mGluR-LTD, would exhibit improved spatial
learning. However, this was not the case, with ArcKR mice
showing specific defects in reversal learning strategies. Instead
of using a combination of random, serial, and spatial strategies,
as observed in WT, ArcKR mice relied primarily on a serial strat-
egy resulting in more errors during task reversal. These mice are
unable to engage multiple strategic approaches and thus lack
the cognitive flexibility required to efficiently complete the task.
How does the enhancement of LTD lead to specific cognitive
deficits? During reversal learning, memories of the previously
learned task are updated as new memories are acquired
(McKenzie and Eichenbaum, 2011). Neural representation of
such memory updating requires a precise balance between syn-
aptic depression and potentiation (Takeuchi et al., 2013). If the
amplitude of the depression is too high (i.e., enhanced LTD) or
occurs too early (due to a lower threshold), this might delay or
prevent the acquisition of new memories. Conversely, if LTD is
impaired, this could prevent the updating of memories acquired
during the acquisition phase, interfering with task reversal.
Intriguingly, defects in these forms of plasticity are observed
in neurological disease models, which are associated with
elevated levels of Arc, (e.g., Fragile X syndrome, Angelman syn-
drome, and Alzheimer’s disease) (Auerbach and Bear, 2010;
Greer et al., 2010; Megill et al., 2015; Pastuzyn and Shepherd,
2017; Wu et al., 2011). Thus, an optimal balance of protein trans-
lation, synthesis, and turnover is required for the correct expres-
sion of mGluR-LTD and learning behavior (Citri et al., 2009; Hou
et al., 2006; Klein et al., 2015).
The degree of inhibition produced by low concentrations of
DHPG (50 mM) was the same in both genotypes, suggesting
similar activation of mGluRs and downstream pathways, but
LTD was only produced in ArcKR slices. It seems likely that
Arc is degraded in WT mice and does not reach a sufficient con-
centration to induce LTD, whereas in ArcKR mice, Arc persists,
and thus induces LTD. The amplitude of mGluR-LTD is enhanced
in ArcKR mice and has a postsynaptic origin, as there were no
changes in paired-pulse facilitation. This is further supported
by an increased internalization of the GluA1-containing AMPAR
subunit in ArcKR neurons after DHPG exposure (Figures 1F–
1I). Corroborating this hypothesis is the observation that there
is a significant reduction in the rectification index of AMPAR-
mediated mEPSC amplitude in neurons overexpressing Arc,
indicating a reduction in the number of GluA1-containing
AMPAR subunits at synapses (DaSilva et al., 2016; Wall and
Corre
ˆ a, 2018).
There were no changes in Arc protein or Arc mRNA levels be-
tween genotypes under basal conditions (Figures S2C, S2D, and
S2F), consistent with the lack of differences in basal synaptic
transmission (Figures 2A and 2B). Similar to previous reports
(Guzowski et al., 2001), we found that prolonged behavioral

 training reduced Arc mRNA levels (Figure 3G), although there
were no changes in Arc protein expression (Figure S4E). This
may reflect a fall in transcription rate, a loss of mRNA, or the
slow degradation of protein. Following completion of the reversal
task, there was a significant increase in Arc mRNA and Arc pro-
tein in ArcKR mice (Figure 3G; Figure S4E). Interestingly, the
amplitude of LTD was reduced in both WT and ArcKR mice
following behavioral training when compared to naive littermates
(Figures 4B and 4C). This did not appear to be a consequence of
changes in Grm5 mRNA expression. The mechanism for this
reduction in LTD is unclear but is likely postsynaptic, as no

quent depression through a feedback
mechanism that reduces induction of
Arc or altered signaling pathways down-
stream of Arc.
Although Arc ubiquitination was attenu-
ated in ArcKR mice (Figure 1E), there was
no accumulation of Arc protein in vivo
(Figure S4E). This suggests that this Arc
ubiquitination pathway is not utilized as
frequently during early stages of develop-
ment. Alternatively, additional pathways
might ubiquitinate Arc earlier in life and
during specific phases of learning. Indeed,
following
stimulation
of
N-methyl-D-
aspartate receptors, another unknown
E3 ubiquitin ligase has been proposed to ubiquitinate Arc at an
alternative lysine site, K136, leading to Arc degradation by the
ubiquitin proteasome pathway (Gozdz et al., 2017; Mabb and
Ehlers, 2018). However, this does not appear to be involved in
AMPAR endocytosis as mutation of this site in addition to
K268 and K269 did not further alter AMPAR internalization (Fig-
ures S1B and S1C). An alternative interpretation is that the lyso-
some-dependent pathway regulates Arc degradation (Nixon and
Cataldo, 1995).
Recent findings suggest that Arc protein and mRNA undergo
self-intercellular transfer by assembling into virus-like capsids.

Neuron 98, 1124–1132, June 27, 2018
 This mechanism may require exosome secretion from one
neuron and endocytic uptake by another (Ashley et al., 2018;
Pastuzyn et al., 2018). A possible explanation for the moderate
accumulation of Arc protein in ArcKR mice is that Arc ubiquitina-
tion participates in this transfer process. Evidence to support this
hypothesis is highlighted by our recent findings demonstrating
that the E3 ubiquitin ligase for Arc, Triad3A/RNF216 is enriched
at clathrin-coated pits (CCPs), regions that participate in the
endocytosis of cargo molecules. Recently, a point mutation in
Arc (W197A) was shown to enhance binding to Triad3A but
decrease interactions with AP-2 and dynamin (DaSilva et al.,
2016). These findings suggest another functional role for Arc/
Triad3A interaction. Further evidence supporting these findings
is that expression of the ArcKR mutant stays longer at the plasma
membrane but rarely overlaps with CCPs, suggesting that
Triad3A-dependent ubiquitination might couple Arc to endocytic
regions (Mabb et al., 2014a).
Our results reveal that disruption in the degradation of a single
protein, Arc, is sufficient to enhance mGluR-LTD resulting in def-
icits in reversal learning strategy. Thus, manipulation of Arc
longevity may be a strategy to restore synaptic plasticity defects
in neurological disorders where Arc protein dynamics are
disrupted.

 mice were treated in accordance with the Animal Welfare and Ethics Committee (AWERB) and experiments were performed under
the appropriated project licenses with local and national ethical approval. Samples sizes for behavioral and slice experiments were
calculated using variance from previous experiments to indicate power, which statistical analysis significance was set at 95%. Pri-
mary neuron culture, pilocarpine seizure experiments, and isolation of brain tissue for biochemical experiments were approved by the
Georgia State University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.
Generation of Arc knockin mice
Arc knockin mice were produced by the ingenious targeting laboratory (Ronkonkoma, NY). Gene targeting was performed in iTL IC1
(C57BL/6) ES cells to introduce 2 point mutations within Exon 1 of the Arc gene. When encoded, the introduction of these point mu-
tations leads to a substitution of Lysine to Arginine in positions 268 and 269, sites that were previously identified as being ubiquiti-
nated by Triad3A and Ube3a (Greer et al., 2010; Mabb et al., 2014a). ES cells were screened and positive clones were microinjected
into BALB/c blastocysts and transferred to pseudopregnant female mice. Resulting chimeras with a high percentage black coat color
were mated to C57BL/6 FLP mice to remove the Neo cassette, and backcrossed five times to C57/BL6 mice. Arc+/+ (WT) were distin-
guished from ArcKR/KR (ArcKR) homozygous mice by genotyping for the presence of the one remaining FRT site after Neo deletion
using the following primer sets: ARC-KI-NDEL1: 50-cttattggagtatgtgccatttctc-30 (Primer 1) and ARC-KI-NDEL2: 50-cattgaccctgtctc
cagattc-30 (Primer 2) where the wild-type band size is 291 base pairs and the knockin band size is 355 base pairs.
Primary neuron culture and cell treatment
Primary hippocampal neurons of mixed sex were isolated from P0-1 mice as previously described (Corre
ˆ a et al., 2009). To assess Arc
levels following mGluR-LTD, DIV12 - 14 primary hippocampal neurons were pre-treated with 2 mM TTX (Tocris) for 4 hr. TTX was
washed out and 100 mm (S)-3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine (DHPG, Tocris) was applied for a total of 10 min. Cells were harvested
45 min later following DHPG washout. To block protein synthesis of Arc, 20 mM anisomycin (Sigma) was added at the 45 min time
point and cells were harvested 30, 60, and 120 min later.
The primary cortical neuron culture protocol was based on (Shepherd et al., 2006). Cortices of mixed sex were dissected from E18
rat embryos. Cortices were dissociated in DNase (0.01%; Sigma-Aldrich) and papain (0.067%; Worthington Biochemicals), then trit-
urated with a fire-polished glass pipette to obtain a single-cell suspension. Cells were pelleted at 1000xg for 4 min, the supernatant
removed, and cells resuspended and counted with a TC-20 cell counter (Bio-Rad). Neurons were plated on glass coverslips (Carolina
Biological Supply, Burlington, NC) coated with poly-l-lysine (0.2 mg/mL; Sigma-Aldrich) in 12-well plates (Greiner Bio-One) at
100,000 cells/mL. Neurons were initially plated in Neurobasal media containing 5% horse serum, 2% GlutaMAX, 2% B-27, and
1% penicillin/streptomycin (Thermo Fisher Scientific) in a 37�C incubator with 5% CO2. On DIV4, neurons were fed via half media
exchange with Neurobasal media containing 1% horse serum, GlutaMAX, and penicillin/streptomycin, 2% B-27, and 5 mM cytosine
b-d-arabinofuranoside (AraC; Sigma-Aldrich). Neurons were fed every three days thereafter.
Neuron transfection
At DIV14, transfections were performed using Lipofectamine 2000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) as described previously (Shepherd
et al., 2006). Immunostaining was performed 16 hr later.
Immunocytochemistry
At DIV15, transfected neurons were live-labeled for surface GluA1 receptors (Shepherd et al., 2006). Neurons were washed twice at
10�C with 4% sucrose/1X phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; 10X: 1.4 M NaCl, 26.8 mM KCl, 62 mM Na2HPO4, 35.3 mM KH2PO4,
pH 7.4), then incubated in anti-GluA1-NT diluted in MEM containing 2% GlutaMAX, 2% B-27, 15 mM HEPES (Thermo Fisher Scien-
tific), 1 mM sodium pyruvate (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and 33 mM glucose at 10�C for 20 min. Neurons were then fixed for 15 min
with 4% sucrose/4% paraformaldehyde (Thermo Fisher Scientific) in 1X PBS, then incubated in Alexa Fluor 555 (Thermo Fisher Sci-
entific) to label only surface GluA1. Following this, neurons were permeabilized for 10 min with 0.2% Triton X-100 (Amresco) in 1X
PBS, and blocked for 30 min in 5% normal donkey serum (Jackson ImmunoResearch) in 1X PBS. Neurons were then incubated
with rabbit anti-Arc antibody (Synaptic Systems), diluted in block for 1 hr at RT, washed 3 3 5 min in 1X PBS, and incubated in sec-
ondary antibody (Alexa Fluor 488; Jackson ImmunoResearch) diluted in block for 1 hr at RT. Neurons on coverslips were mounted on
glass slides in Fluoromount (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and dried overnight at RT.
Neuron imaging and analysis
A total of 15 transfected and untransfected neurons were imaged at 60X on an Olympus FV1000 confocal microscope (Tokyo, Japan).
GluA1 immunostaining was analyzed using ImageJ software. The most intense immunostaining was used to set an arbitrary pixel
intensity threshold, which was applied to every image in the experiment. Integrated density of each puncta in two 25-mm dendrite
segments/neuron was measured and summed to obtain a total integrated density of the puncta on the dendritic segment.
High-content AMPA receptor trafficking assay
Primary hippocampal neurons were prepared as stated above and plated in 96-well microplates (Molecular Probes) at a density of
20,000 cells per well. Neurons were fed as previously described (Corre
ˆ a et al., 2009). At DIV 14, neurons were treated with 2 mM TTX
(Tocris) for 4 hr. Following treatment, neurons were cooled to room temperature and incubated with a 1:150 dilution of anti-GluA1
(Millipore, MAB2263MI) or anti-GluA2 (Invitrogen, Clone 6C4) antibody prepared in conditioned media. Neurons were incubated
for 20 min at room temperature to allow antibody binding. Samples were washed 3 times with room temperature Neurobasal medium
(GIBCO) and then treated with vehicle or 100 mm DHPG for 10 min. After 10 min, DHPG was washed out and neurons were fixed with
Neuron 98, 1124–1132.e1–e7, June 27, 2018
e3
 4% paraformaldehyde/4% sucrose in PBS for 20 min at 4�C. Neurons were then washed with 1X DPBS (GIBCO) and blocked in
Odyssey Blocking Buffer (Li-COR) for 90 min at room temperature. To measure surface receptors, neurons were incubated for
1 hr in a 1:1,500 dilution of IRDye 680RD Goat anti-Mouse IgG (H+L) (Li-COR) secondary antibody. Neurons were then washed
with TBS (50 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, pH7.6) 5 times and then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde/4% sucrose in PBS for
20 min at 4�C. Neurons were then washed with TBS 2 more times and permeabilized in TBS containing 0.2% saponin (ACROS
Organics) for 15 min at room temperature. Neurons were then blocked in Odyssey Blocking Buffer for 90 min at room temperature.
To label the internalized pool of receptors, neurons were incubated for 1 hr in a 1:1,500 dilution of IRDye 800CW Donkey anti-Mouse
IgG (H+L) (Li-COR) secondary antibody. Cells were then washed with TBS 5 times and imaged on the Odyssey Clx Imaging System
(LI-COR) with a resolution of 84 mm, medium quality and a 3 mm focus offset. Images were processed in FIJI where ROIs were drawn
on each well. The integrated density was measured on ROIs superimposed on the 680 (surface receptor pool) and 800 (internal re-
ceptor pool) channels individually. Experiments were run in triplicate and integrated density values for each channel in individual
experimental wells were subtracted to a secondary only control. To calculate changes in surface receptor expression, the following
calculation was used: RS/RT, where RS represents the integrated density of surface receptors and RT represents the integrated den-
sity of surface receptors + integrated density of internal receptors.
Synaptosome preparation
Synaptosomes were prepared as previously described (Mabb et al., 2014a). Briefly, hippocampi were dissected from male and fe-
male P21 WT and ArcKR mice. Hippocampi were lysed in 10 volumes of HEPES-buffered sucrose (0.32 M sucrose, 4 mM HEPES
pH7.4 containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors (Roche) and homogenized using a motor driven glass-teflon homogenizer
at �900 rpm (10-15 strokes). The homogenate was centrifuged at 800-1000 x g at 4�C to remove the pelleted nuclear fraction.
The resultant supernatant was spun at 10,000 x g for 15 min to yield the crude synaptosomal pellet. The pellet was resuspended
in 10 volumes of HEPES-buffered sucrose and then respun at 10,000 x g for another 15 min to yield the crude synaptosomal fraction.
The resulting pellet was lysed by hypoosmotic shock in 9 volumes ice cold H20 plus protease/phosphatase inhibitors (Roche) and
three strokes of a glass-teflon homogenizer and rapidly adjusted to 4 mM HEPES using 1 M HEPES, pH 7.4 stock solution. Samples
were mixed constantly at 4�C for 30 min to ensure complete lysis. The lysate was centrifuged at 25,000 x g for 20 min to yield a su-
pernatant (crude synaptic vesicle fraction) and a pellet (lysed synaptosomal membrane fraction). The pellet was resuspended in
HEPES-buffered sucrose and used for western analysis.
Western blotting
Hippocampal lysate obtained from WT and ArcKR mice was prepared as previously described (Eales et al., 2014). Western blots were
performed as previously described (Eales et al., 2014; Mabb et al., 2014b). Membranes were probed with the following antibodies:
rabbit anti-Arc (Synaptic Systems, 1:1,000), goat anti-NR1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, 1:1,000), goat anti-NR2B (Santa Cruz Biotech-
nology, 1:1,000), mouse anti-GluA1 (EMD Millipore, Clone RH95, 1:500), mouse anti-GluA2 (Invitrogen, Clone 6C4, 1:500), rabbit anti-
mGluR1A (Sigma, G9665, 1:500), rabbit anti-mGluR5 (EMDMillipore, AB5675, 1:500), rabbit anti-PSD-95 (Synaptic Systems,
1:1,000), mouse anti-b-Actin (Genetex, 1:5,000), mouse anti-GAPDH (Millipore, MAB374, 1:3,000 or Abcam, ab8245, 1:5,000).
The following secondary antibodies were used: IRDye 680RD Goat anti-Mouse IgG (H+L) (Li-COR, 1:20,000), IRDye 800CW Goat
anti-Rabbit IgG (H+L) (Li-COR, 1:15,000), IRDye 800CW Donkey anti-Goat IgG (H+L) (LI-COR, 1:15,000), Goat anti-Rabbit IgG-
HRP H+L (Cell Signaling, 1:10,000) and Goat anti-Mouse IgG HRP LC (Jackson ImmunoResearch, 1:20,000). Blots were imaged us-
ing the Odyssey Clx Imaging System (LI-COR) or the ChemiDoc MP Imaging System (Bio-Rad).
Pilocarpine-induced Arc ubiquitination assays
Pilocarpine seizures were induced in postnatal day 60–70 male and female WT and ArcKR mice as previously described (Peixoto
et al., 2012). Hippocampi from mice were harvested 30 min after the presence of Class III seizure onset. Arc protein ubiquitination
was measured as previously described (Mabb et al., 2014a).
Quantitative PCR
RNA extraction and cDNA synthesis
Hippocampi from trained and naive WT and ArcKR mice were collected, submerged in RNAlater, and stored at �20�C until pro-
cessed. The tissue was transferred into TRIzol reagent (Fisher Scientific), disrupted using sterile pestles and homogenized by pas-
sage through a QIAshredder column (QIAGEN). The homogenization was followed by chloroform phase separation and purification of
the total RNA using the RNeasy Lipid Tissue Mini Kit (QIAGEN). Purified RNA was subjected to on-column DNase treatment (Fisher
Scientific) and the concentration and purity of the RNA was assessed spectrophotometrically using the NanoDrop ND-1000
(NanoDrop). RNA used had an A260/A280 ratio of 1.9–2.25. First-strand cDNA synthesis was performed using the Transcriptor First
Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Roche) using an anchored oligo(dT)18 primer, according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
qPCR
Primers were designed with the help of Primer3Plus software (Untergasser et al., 2007). qPCR was performed using a StepOnePlus
Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems, Life Technologies). Each reaction comprised of 2 mL of diluted cDNA, 5 mL PowerUp
SYBR Green Master Mix (ThermoFisher) and 500 nM primers in a final volume of 10 mL. The PCR cycling conditions were as
e4
Neuron 98, 1124–1132.e1–e7, June 27, 2018
 follows: 50�C for 2 min, 95�C for 2 min, then 40 cycles of 95�C for 15 s and 60�C for 1 min. Cycling was followed by melt curve
recording between 60�C and 95�C. Primer standard curves were performed to estimate the PCR efficiencies for each primer pair.
Cycle threshold (Ct) values were determined by the StepOne Plus software and adjusted manually. All qPCR reactions were run
in duplicate (for analysis of P60 mice) or triplicate (for analysis of Barnes maze trained mice). A mean Ct value was calculated for
each primer pair and each experimental condition. Relative quantification of Arc and Grm5 mRNA was performed using the 2-DDCt
method (Livak and Schmittgen, 2001). Data were normalized to the geometric mean of GAPDH and/or GPI (Glucose-6-Phosphate
Isomerase) and presented as expression relative to a standard condition as indicated in the figure legends. Primer sequences are
as follows: Arc-L tgttgaccgaagtgtccaag; Arc-R aagttgttctccagcttgcc; mGluR5-L cagtccgtgagcagtatgg; mGluR5-R gcccaatgactc

Mouse behavior
Behavior cohort
For behavior experiments, 12 WT and 12 ArcKR mice were used. Mice were sex balanced and housed separately by sex in groups of
4 (2 animals per genotype). No deaths occurred throughout the course of all behavioral studies. All behavioral tests were performed
with the experimenter blinded to genotype.
Rotarod
8-week-old mice were tested for motor coordination and learning on an accelerating rotarod (Ugo Basile, Stoelting). For the first test
session, mice were given three trials, with 45 s between each trial. Two additional trials were given 48 hr later. Rpm (revolutions per
min) was set at an initial value of 3, with a progressive increase to a maximum of 30 rpm across 5 min (the maximum trial length). The
latency to fall from the top of the rotating barrel was recorded.
Open field test
Exploratory activity in a novel environment was assessed in 8-week-old mice by a one-hour trial in an open field chamber (41 cm x
41 cm x 30 cm) crossed by a grid of photobeams (VersaMax system, AccuScan Instruments). Counts were taken of the number of
photobeams broken during the trial in five-min intervals, with separate measures for locomotion (total distance traveled) and rearing
movements. Time spent in the center region of the open field was measured as an index of anxiety-like behavior.
Elevated plus maze
The elevated plus maze was used to assess anxiety–like behavior, based on a natural tendency of mice to actively explore a new
environment, versus a fear of being in an open area. Mice (7-week-old) were given one five-min trial on the plus maze, which had
two walled arms (the closed arms, 20 cm in height) and two open arms. The maze was elevated 50 cm from the floor, and the
arms were 30 cm long. Mice were placed on the center section (8 cm x 8 cm) and allowed to freely explore the maze. Measures
were taken of time spent in, and number of entries into, the open and closed arms of the maze.
Marble-burying assay
To measure anxiety-like behaviors, 11-week-old mice were placed in a Plexiglas cage located in a sound-attenuating chamber with
ceiling light and fan. The cage contained 5 cm of corncob bedding, with 20 black glass marbles (14 mm diameter) arranged in an
equidistant 5 X 4 grid on top of the bedding. Subjects were given access to the marbles for 30 min. The number of marbles buried
(defined by two thirds of the marble being covered by the bedding) was measured.
Novel object recognition test
Mice (22-week-old) were habituated in a Plexiglas cage containing 2 cm of corncob bedding for 30 min. 24 hr later (Acquisition
phase), two of the same objects were placed in the same habituated cage containing 2 cm of corncob bedding. Mice were allowed
to explore both objects for a total of 30 min. 24 hr later (Trial phase), one of the objects was replaced with a novel object and mice were
allowed to explore both the familiar and novel object for a total of 30 min. Measurements of time spent with each object were scored
during min 2 through 12 of the acquisition and trial phase. The Novel Object Recognition Index was calculated as the (Time spent with
novel object/(Time spent with novel object + Time spent with familiar object)). Object interactions were defined as active interaction
with the object where the mouse’s nose was at least 1 cm pointed toward the object, time spent interacting/touching, and active
sniffing of the object. Rearing on the objects was not scored. Exclusion criteria was set for <30 s interaction with both objects during
the acquisition phase. One WT and two ArcKR mice did not meet the criteria and were excluded from the analysis.
Barnes maze test
WT (24) and ArcKR male mice (27) aged 21-25 days were tested. Out of these 5 WT and 6 ArcKR mice were trained for 1 day, 5 WT and
7 ArcKR mice were trained for 15 days and 19 WT and 14 ArcKR were trained for 20-21 days. Spatial learning was assessed using a
modified circular Barnes maze that measured 1 m in diameter, was situated 1 m from the floor, and contained 20 5-cm holes that were
evenly spaced (5 cm) around the perimeter. The maze was positioned centrally within the lab, with surrounding equipment and archi-
tectural features kept in fixed positions, to act as spatial cues for learning. The maze contained an ‘exit’ box positioned under one of
the holes and a ‘‘fake’’ box (incorporated to mimic light reflection from the exit box but with no depth) under another. The exit hole was
randomly assigned on the first day and maintained in this position for 15 days for the ‘‘exit’’ box prior to the 180� shift (see below) and
for the remaining 5-6 days of training. Each day, mice were randomly placed in the center of the maze, released, and allowed to

e5
 explore the maze. The task was completed when the mouse entered the exit box. All runs were recorded using a camera system
(Henelec Model 335 BWL SONY) attached to a computer for offline analysis (Any-MAZE v4.96, Stoelting). Total distance, speed,
and accuracy of task performance were measured. On days 1-5, the exit box contained flavored treats as a reward for task comple-
tion. On days 6-21, treats were awarded in the home cage on completion to prevent cued orientation of the exit box location via
olfactory stimulation. On days 16-21, the position of the exit box was rotated 180� to determine the spatial component of and coping
ability for the task. Data analysis was carried out in a blind fashion, independently from the experimenter. Error number was measured
by calculating the number of incorrect holes visited before locating the correct ‘‘exit’’ hole. Mapping the progression of the animals
around the maze allowed determination of the search strategy. These were: random: no consistent pattern, >2 crossings of the open
field; serial: a hole-by-hole progression with R3 consecutive holes visited; and spatial: moving directly to the exit hole ± 2 holes and
no deviation outside of the quadrant.
Electrophysiology
AMPA receptor-mediated-miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs) recorded in cultured neurons
Hippocampal neuronal cultures were prepared from postnatal day 0 pups from C57BL/6 wild-type mice as previously described
(Corre
ˆ a et al., 2009). Briefly, hippocampi were dissected from the brain, dissociated with trypsin, and approximately 105 cells
were plated onto 22-mm glass coverslips coated with poly-L-lysine in Neurobasal medium containing 1% L-glutamine, 1% peni-
cillin-streptomycin, 2% B27 supplement (Invitrogen) and 5% horse serum. 24 hr after plating the media was completely changed
and cells were grown in serum-free media. Cultures were maintained at 37�C and 5% CO2 in a humidified incubator and transfections
of either scrambled or Triad3-shRNA (Mabb et al., 2014a) were performed using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Cells expressing
scrambled or Triad3-shRNA constructs were recorded at least 3-5 days after transfections. Coverslips were transferred to the
recording chamber and perfused at a constant flow rate of (2 mL/min) with recording solution composed of (mM): 127 NaCl,
1.9 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 2 CaCl2, 1.3 K H2PO4, 26 NaHCO3, 10 D-glucose, pH 7.4 (when bubbled with 95% O2 and 5% CO2,
300 mOsm) at 28-30�C. Tetrodotoxin (Tocris, 1 mM), picrotoxin (50 mM, Tocris), and L-689,560 (5 mM, Tocris) were present in the
recording solutions to isolate mEPSCs. To induce mGluR-dependent synaptic depression, (RS)-3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine,
(DHPG, 100 mM, Tocris) was bath applied for 10 min. Neurons were visualized using IR-DIC optics with an Olympus BX51W1 micro-
scope and Hitachi CCD camera (Scientifica) at a total magnification of 400X. Whole-cell patch clamp recordings were made from
transfected (identified by fluorescence at 488 nm) pyramidal neurons using patch pipettes (5-8 MU) made from thick walled borosil-
icate glass (Harvard Apparatus) filled with (mM): 135 potassium gluconate, 7 NaCl, 10 HEPES, 0.5 EGTA, 10 phosphocreatine, 2
MgATP, 0.3 NaGTP, pH 7.2, 290 mOsm. Recordings of mEPSCs were obtained at a holding potential of �75 mV using an Axon
Multiclamp 700B amplifier (Molecular Devices), filtered at 3 kHz and digitized at 20 kHz (Digidata 1440A, Molecular Devices).
Data acquisition was performed using pClamp 10 (Molecular Devices). Analysis of mEPSCs was performed using MiniAnalysis soft-
ware (SynaptoSoft). Events were manually analyzed and were accepted if they had an amplitude >5 pA (events below this amplitude
were difficult to distinguish from baseline noise) and a faster rise than decay. Statistical significance was measured using a one-way
ANOVA with 0.05% taken as significant.
Hippocampal slice preparation
Hippocampal slices (400 mm) were obtained from 21 to 35 day-old WT and ArcKR littermates. For trained mice, slices were obtained
up to 1 hr after the last training session. Animals were sacrificed by cervical dislocation and decapitated in accordance with the UK
Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act (1986). The brain was rapidly removed and placed in ice-cold high Mg2+, low Ca2+ artificial CSF
(aCSF), consisting of the following (in mM): 127 NaCl, 1.9 KCl, 8 MgCl2, 0.5 CaCl2, 1.2 KH2PO4, 26 NaHCO3, 10 D-glucose (pH 7.4
when bubbled with 95% O2 and 5% CO2, 300 mOSM). Parasagittal brain slices were then prepared using a Microm HM 650V micro-
slicer in ice-cold aCSF (2-4�C). Slices were trimmed and the CA3 region was removed. Slices were allowed to recover at 34�C for
3-6 hr in aCSF (1 mM MgCl2, 2 mM CaCl2) before use.
Extracellular recording from hippocampal slices
Field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs) were recorded from interleaved slices from WT and ArcKR littermates. An individual
slice was transferred to the recording chamber, submerged in aCSF (composition as above), maintained at 32�C, and perfused at a
rate of 6 mL/min. The slice was placed on a grid allowing perfusion above and below the tissue and all tubing was gas tight (to prevent
loss of oxygen). To record fEPSPs, an aCSF filled microelectrode was placed on the surface of stratum radiatum in the CA1 region.
A bipolar concentric stimulating electrode (FHC) controlled by an isolated pulse stimulator, model 2100 (AM Systems, WA) was used
to evoke fEPSPs at the Schaffer collateral–commissural pathway. All recordings were made in the presence of 50 mM picrotoxin to
block GABAA receptors (Tocris) and the NMDA receptor antagonist L-689,560 (trans-2-carboxy-5,7-dichloro-4-phenylaminocarbo-
nylamino-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinoline; 5 mM; Tocris). Field EPSPs were evoked at 0.1 Hz (200 ms stimulus), with a 20-min baseline
recorded at a stimulus intensity that gave 40% of the maximal response. To induce mGluR-LTD, 50 or 100 mM of (RS)-3,5-DHPG
(3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine, Tocris) was applied for 10 min and then washed off for at least one hour as previously described (Eales
et al., 2014). Recordings of fEPSPs were made using a differential model 3000 amplifier (AM systems, WA USA) with signals filtered at
3 kHz and digitized online (10 kHz) with a Micro CED (Mark 2) interface controlled by Spike software (Vs 7.08), Cambridge Electronic
e6
Neuron 98, 1124–1132.e1–e7, June 27, 2018
 Design, Cambridge UK). Field EPSPs were analyzed using Spike software and graphs prepared using Origin (Microcal), with the slope
of fEPSPs measured for a 1 ms linear region following the fiber volley.
Statistical Analysis
Statistical analyses applied were the post hoc Student’s t test or repeated-measures ANOVA with pairwise multiple comparisons.
Behavioral data were analyzed using two-way or repeated-measures Analysis of Variance (ANOVA). Fisher’s protected least-signif-
icant difference (PLSD) tests were used for comparing group means only when a significant F value was determined. For all compar-
isons, significance was set at p % 0.05. Data presented in figures and tables are means (±SEM).
