Abstract
Objectives
A survey of a population-based sample of U.S adults was conducted to measure their atti-
tudes about, and inform the design of the Precision Medicine Initiative’s planned national
cohort study.
Methods
An online survey was conducted by GfK between May and June of 2015. The influence of
different consent models on willingness to share data was examined by randomizing partici-
pants to one of eight consent scenarios.
Results
Of 4,777 people invited to take the survey, 2,706 responded and 2,601 (54% response rate)
provided valid responses. Most respondents (79%) supported the proposed study, and
54% said they would definitely or probably participate if asked. Support for and willingness
to participate in the study varied little among demographic groups; younger respondents,
LGBT respondents, and those with more years of education were significantly more likely to
take part if asked. The most important study incentive that the survey asked about was
learning about one’s own health information. Willingness to share data and samples under
broad, study-by-study, menu and dynamic consent models was similar when a statement
about transparency was included in the consent scenarios. Respondents were generally
interested in taking part in several governance functions of the cohort study.

Data Availability Statement: With respect to our
ability to share the data, the ethos of the Precision
Medicine Initiative is to share data openly. However,
in this instance, the survey data used in the paper
were collected under a contractual agreement with
the survey research company GfK. GfK carries out
the survey on a sample drawn from a large
population-based sample that GfK recruits and
maintains. GfK has an ethical and contractual
obligation to protect the privacy of its panel members
and their households. To this end GfK passes these
obligations on to its clients. We are bound ethically
 Conclusions
A large majority of the U.S. adults who responded to the survey supported a large national
cohort study. Levels of support for the study and willingness to participate were both consis-
tent across most demographic groups. The opportunity to learn health information about
one’s self from the study appears to be a strong motivation to participate.
Introduction
Precision medicine is an emerging approach to disease prevention, diagnosis and treatment
that takes into account differences between individuals. While not new, to date it has only been
applied to certain conditions. The Precision Medicine Initiative1 (PMI) plans to build a com-
prehensive scientific knowledge base to implement precision medicine on a larger scale by
launching a national cohort study of a million or more Americans [1]. The national cohort
study will aim to foster open, responsible data sharing, maintain participant privacy, and build
on strong partnerships between researchers and participants [2].
Prospective cohort studies using biospecimens are a common approach taken to examine the
effects and interactions of genes, environment, and lifestyle [3–7]. Although they are labor-,
time-, and capital-intensive [8], these studies can provide the statistical power needed to detect
small biological effects on disease [9–10]. Both public [3,5,11,12] and private [4,6,7] cohort stud-
ies and biobanks have been created, and genetic analyses have been incorporated into existing
cohort studies as genotyping and computational tools become more accessible [11,13,14].
The Precision Medicine Initiative1 aims to expand on these efforts to engage a wider
group who would volunteer a standardized set of health information that can be shared broadly
with qualified researchers. Cohort volunteers would share their information and biological
specimens for genomic and other analyses. Genomic information would be combined with
clinical data from electronic health records, lifestyle data, and data measured through mobile
health devices, for use by a broad range of researchers. Participants would have access to infor-
mation about cohort-fueled research findings, as well as some individual research results.
The National Institutes of Health (NIH) along with other federal agencies has begun to
design and execute this large prospective study as part of the White House’s Precision Medicine
Initiative1 [1,2,10]. During the initial planning process for this PMI Cohort Program, NIH
engaged a wide variety of expertise through four public workshops on issues of design and
vision for the cohort [15–18], and two Requests for Information [19, 20].
At a July, 2015 workshop on participant engagement and health equity a broad range of
experts discussed the role of participant engagement in the design and conduct of an inclusive
PMI cohort [17]. The discussions, which focused on building and sustaining public trust,
actively engaging participants, and enlisting participants to set research priorities and directly
collect study data informed the strategic design of the PMI cohort [21].
The workshop concluded that continued engagement of a broad range of stakeholders will be
needed to plan, carry out and sustain the PMI cohort program. As part of this larger public
engagement effort, a survey of U. S. adults was conducted to measure support for such a study, to
measure acceptability of various design features, and to identify and prioritize public concerns.

and legally not to share respondent identifiers, or data
that could be linked to the larger dataset we possess
that would allow for the identification of respondents
or households. Requests for collaborations to
examine aggregate analyses of these data are
welcome and can be sent to dave.kaufman@nih.gov.
Funding: The Foundation for National Institutes of
Health directly paid for GfK to field the survey. The
authors themselves received no specific funding for
the work. FNIH did not participate in data collection,
analysis, decisions to publish or preparation of the
manuscript. They were involved in discussions about
the logistics of study design but did not influence
survey content.
Competing Interests: During the study and at the
time of publication, DK worked at the National
Institutes of Health (NIH) which is sponsoring and
developing the PMI cohort study. He was not involved
in those efforts. During the study and at the time of
publication, KH, RB, and LM worked at the NIH which
is sponsoring and developing the PMI cohort study,
and were directly involved in development of the PMI
cohort study. SD worked at the NIH at the time the
survey was developed where she worked directly on
development of the PMI study. At the time of
publication, she worked at the White House where
she was involved in some aspects of developing the
PMI study. This does not alter the authors' adherence
to all PLOS ONE policies on data sharing and
materials.
 a national cohort study. Formal consent was not obtained both because the study was judged
as exempt, and because completion of the survey is taken as a form of consent to participate.
The survey was not intended to collect psychometric data and thus did not rely on validated
psychometric scales. However, to examine changes over time in public support for and hypo-
thetical willingness to take part in a large U.S. cohort study, exact wording from two previous
surveys was used for some questions.[22–24] Some questions came from a related survey of
biobank participants under development at the time by the NIH-funded Electronic Medical
Records and Genomics (or eMERGE) consortia [25]. Response choices consisted of pre-
defined options. Most of these question choices were developed based on findings of focus
groups conducted as part of prior studies [22–24].
The survey addressed support for and willingness to take part in the cohort study, specific
aspects of participation, study oversight including participant involvement in governance, and
the return of information to participants. Respondents were first shown a description of the
cohort study. (S1 Appendix) At the end of the description, respondents were told that partici-
pants in the cohort study “might get access to the information collected about their health”.
Respondents were then asked several questions about their support for the concept and will-
ingness to take part if they were asked. (S2 Appendix contains exact wording of all of the ques-
tions analyzed here.) Respondents were also shown one of eight different scenarios, selected at
random, describing study consent and data sharing and asked whether they would “consent to
share your samples and information with researchers in this manner”. The eight scenarios var-
ied with respect to two factors: the structure of consent (broad, study by study, menu, or
dynamic consent) and the presence or absence of a statement that cohort study participants
would “have access to a website where you would be able to see what studies are going on,
which studies are using your information, and what each study has learned.” The exact word-
ing of all eight versions of consent is found in S3 Appendix.
A pilot survey (n = 30) fielded between May 5 and May 7, 2015 evaluated the instrument
length and logic. Median completion time for the pilot was 23 minutes; the instrument was
shortened to 20 minutes. The final instrument was translated into Spanish for use by respon-
dents who preferred it. The translation was back-translated and certified.
Sample selection and online survey administration was managed by the online survey firm
GfK. The survey sample was drawn from GfK’s KnowledgePanel, which is itself a probability-
based pool of approximately 55,000 people designed to be representative of the U.S. population.
Individuals can become GfK panelists only after being randomly selected by GfK; no one
can volunteer to be a member. GfK selects people using probability-based sampling of
addresses from the U.S. Postal Service’s Delivery Sequence File, which includes 97% of residen-
tial U.S. households. Excluded from eligibility are those in residential care settings, institution-
alized and incarcerated people, and homeless individuals. Individuals residing at randomly
sampled addresses are invited to join KnowledgePanel through a series of mailings in English
and Spanish; non-responders are phoned when a telephone number can be matched to the
sampled address.
For those who agree to be part of the GfK panel, but do not have Internet access, GfK pro-
vides at no cost a laptop and Internet connection. GfK also optimized the survey for adminis-
tration via smartphone or tablet. When GfK enrolls participants into its panel, each panel
participant answers demographic questions which are banked and periodically updated by
GfK. GfK can then provide data on common demographics for each of its participants, allow-
ing surveys to reduce burden by not asking these questions. Data in this paper on participants’
self-reported race and ethnic group, age, education, gender, sexual orientation or gender iden-
tity, household income, and residence in a metropolitan statistical area were all measured by
GfK prior to this survey.

 GfK attempts to address sources of survey error including sampling error, non-coverage
and non-response due to panel recruitment methods and panel attrition by using demographic
post-stratification weights based on demographics of the U.S. Current Population Survey
(CPS) as the benchmark. Once the data are collected, post-stratification weights are con-
structed so that the study data can be adjusted for the study’s sample design and for survey
nonresponse[26].
This series of methods has resulted in GfK survey samples that compare favorably to other
gold standard methods designed to generate population-based samples [27]. During the field
period for this survey, GfK first drew a random sample of 3,271 U.S. adults from their Web-
enabled panel of approximately 55,000 U.S. residents. This included Hispanics and black non-
Hispanics. In order to meet oversampling goals of 500 in these two groups, three additional
random samples were drawn, including one of 665 Black non-Hispanic adults and two addi-
tional samples of 541 and 320 Hispanic adults. GfK contacted each of these 4,777 individuals
via email to invite them to take part in this survey. Non-respondents received up to four email
reminders from GfK.
The survey was fielded online between May 28, 2015 and June 9, 2015. Participants received
the equivalent of $2 for their time. After survey data were collected, information previously col-
lected by GfK on panel members’ demographics was added to the dataset.
Analysis Methods
Data were cleaned and analyzed using SPSS software [28]. Respondents who skipped more
than one-third of the questions, or who completed the survey in less than one quarter of the
median survey time were excluded from analyses.
Support for the study and willingness to participate were measured using 4-point Likert
scales; two binary variables were created for analysis from these scales. Demographic variables
were analyzed using the categories as shown in Table 1. Two sets of multiple logistic regressions
were conducted. (Table 2) Support for the study and willingness to participate were the depen-
dent variables. In these models, race and ethnic group were treated as a single categorical vari-
able using dummy variables, and treating white non-Hispanics as the reference group.
Education, household income and age were each modeled as ordinal variables using the catego-
ries shown in Tables 1 and 2. Respondents who identified as lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgen-
der (LGBT) were analyzed together as a single group.
The multiple logistic regressions examined demographic factors associated with support
and participation. Analyses that included the entire sample were weighted to 2014 U.S. Census
demographic benchmarks. To examine whether Hispanics who took the survey in English dif-
fered from those who took it in Spanish with respect to support and willingness to participate,
separate regressions were carried out using only Hispanic respondents’ data, adjusting for the
covariates in Table 1 except for race and ethnic group. Analyses within or between different
races and ethnic groups used an alternate set of weights calculated for these oversampled
groups.
Results
In total, 4,777 people were contacted by GfK via email and invited to take the survey, and 2,706
provided at least some responses, for an overall response rate of 56.6%. Overall response rates
were 62.2% (2,036 of 3,271) in the general population sample, 345/665 or 51.9%, in the Black-
non-Hispanic oversample and 325/841 or 38.6% in the Hispanic oversample. It should be
noted that 320 Hispanic cases in the oversample were invited to respond on June 5, 2015 and
the survey was closed on June 9, 2015. Members of this oversample received fewer email

 reminders to take part and had a shorter field period to participate, which could account for
some but not all of the lower completion rate in the Hispanic oversample.
Responses from 105 people (3.9%) were excluded from analysis because they skipped more
than one-third of the questions or completed the survey in less than 6 minutes, leaving a valid
response rate of 2,601/4,777 or 54%. The excluded people did not differ demographically from
those retained in the analysis. The margin of error on opinion estimates based on the sample of
2,601 is +/- 1.9%.
Demographic characteristics of the surveyed population are found in Table 1. After weight-
ing the sample, people with less than twelve years of education were still somewhat underrepre-
sented compared to census data. This should be considered where differences in opinions exist
across education groups.
General Support for the Cohort Study
Immediately after viewing the description of the cohort study, participants were asked ‘Based
on the description you just read, do you think this study should be done?’ Seventy-nine percent
said the study definitely (22%) or probably (57%) should be done, while 21% said probably not
(16%) or definitely not (5%).
Similar levels of support were observed across most demographic groups (Table 2). A multi-
ple logistic regression treating support for the cohort study as a binary independent variable
showed that, adjusting for the other factors in Table 1, no significant differences in support

 were observed between genders, age groups, races or ethnic groups, or between Hispanics who
took the survey in Spanish and English. Fewer years of education (p<0.0001), lower household
income (p = 0.04), and residence outside of metropolitan statistical areas (a proxy for rural resi-
dence, p = 0.03) were independently associated with lower levels of support for the study. How-
ever, in all but one of the demographic categories examined (0–11 years of education), 70% or
more said they supported the study.

cohort study, and their willingness to participate in the study if asked (n = 2,601). Each multiple logistic regression included independent covariates for
gender, self-identified race and ethnic group, survey language (among Hispanics only), age, household income, educational attainment, residence within or
outside a metropolitan statistical area, and identification as either lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender. For purposes of the analysis, race and ethnicity was
treated as a categorical variable, using dummy variables for black non-Hispanics, Hispanics, and other non-white, non-Hispanics. Education, household
income, and age were each treated as 4-level variables using the categories shown below. To examine whether there were differences among Hispanics
who took the survey in Spanish and English, separate regressions were conducted using Hispanic respondents’ data only, adjusting for all of the variables
below except for race and ethnic group.

 Stated Willingness to Participate in the Cohort Study if Asked
The question ‘Would you participate in the cohort study if you were asked?’ was also posed at
the survey’s start. Prior to this question, the only possible personal benefit of participating that
was mentioned was that cohort participants “might get access to the information collected
about their health.” A majority of participants (54%) said they definitely (14%) or probably
(40%) would participate if asked, while the rest said they probably (30%) or definitely (16%)
would not take part. Willingness to participate did not vary considerably between demographic
groups (Table 2). Majorities (>50%) in most groups said they would participate if asked, and
in each group, at least 1 in 9 people said they would definitely take part. A second multiple
logistic regression treated willingness to participate as a binary independent variable. Adjusting
for the other factors in Table 1, increasing years of education (p<0.0001) and younger age
(p<0.0001) were independently associated with increased likelihood of willingness to partici-
pate. Compared to white non-Hispanics, Hispanic respondents were more likely to say they
would participate (59% vs 53%, adjusted p = 0.009). As a group, respondents who identified as
lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender were significantly more likely to say they would participate
if asked (p = 0.01).
One in four respondents said that they supported the idea of the study, but also said they
would not participate if they were asked. People who supported the study but would not partic-
ipate if asked were more than twice as likely as those who would participate to agree that the
study “would take too much of my time” (77% vs 30%), and were less likely than those who
would take part to agree with the statement “I trust the study to protect my privacy” (51% vs.
81% respectively).
The survey was not designed to educate people about precision medicine or biomedical
research. However it was hypothesized that thinking about some of the attitudinal questions in
the survey could influence respondents’ opinions about taking part in the study. To test this
hypothesis, near the end of the survey, respondents were asked again “Now that you have had a
chance to think about the study, would you participate in the study if you were asked?” Overall,
responses were fairly similar to the earlier question– 56% said they would definitely (15%) or
probably (41%) take part if asked; 25% said they probably would not participate and 19% said
they definitely would not. Seven in ten (70%) did not change their answer from the beginning
to the end of the survey. However, 15% had grown more positive about participating by the
end of the survey, and 15% had grown more negative. Some demographic differences were
observed in shifts from the beginning of the survey to the end. For example, fewer people who
took the survey in Spanish (61% vs 55%) said they would take part at the end of the survey,
while more people with some college (55% vs 60%) or a bachelor’s degree (60% vs 64%) were
willing to take part at the end of the survey.
Respondents were also asked about specific things they would be willing to do as study par-
ticipants. Among all respondents, one in seven (14%) said they would participate for their life-
time, and an additional 11% said they would take part for at least ten years. Among people who
said they would definitely or probably participate if asked, 42% said they would take part for at
least ten years. However, only one in four of the Black non-Hispanics and Hispanics who were
willing to take part said they would do so for at least ten years.
All respondents, including those who said they would not participate, were asked to “[i]
magine you were considering participating in the study”, and then asked about their willing-
ness to provide various types of data and samples. Nearly three quarters of respondents (73%)
said that if they were participating they would be willing to provide the study with a blood sam-
ple. Higher fractions said they would provide urine, hair, and saliva samples (75%), data from
an activity tracker (i.e. Fitbit) (75%), genetic information (76%), a family medical history

 (77%), soil and water samples from home (83%), and data on lifestyle, diet and exercise (84%).
Among those with a social media account (n = 1,641) only 43% responded that they would
share their social media information with the study.
In each demographic group listed in Table 1, at least 9% of people (one in eleven) said they
would definitely participate, would take part for at least ten years, and would provide the study
with a blood sample.
In the sample, 87% owned either a smart phone (62%) or a cell phone (25%). Three-quarters
of these phone users responded that if they “were texted or prompted on your cell phone to
answer a question from the study, or measure your pulse”, they would be willing to respond at
least once a week. A majority (59%) said they would respond at least once a day, and 28%
would be willing to respond at least twice a day.
Incentives for participation
Respondents were asked about the importance of six different incentives in their decision
about whether or not to participate. The most important incentive was “learning information
about my health”, listed as either somewhat or very important by 90% of people, including at
least 85% of people in each group in Table 1. Receiving payment for their time (80%) and get-
ting health care (77%) were important to more people than receiving free internet connections
(56%), activity trackers (55%) or smartphones and data plans (52%). However, the technology
incentives were of more interest to younger respondents, those with lower household incomes,
and those with fewer years of education.
Respondents said they would be interested in a wide variety of information that the study
might return to them (Fig 1). Three in four would be interested in “lab results” (examples given
were cholesterol and blood sugar) as well as genetic results. Slightly fewer (68%) said they

 would like a copy of their medical record. Six in ten (60%) said they would be interested in
receiving information about other research studies related to their health.
Consent and Sharing of Data and Samples
As described above, respondents were randomly selected to view one of eight consent scenarios
and asked “would you consent to share your samples and information with researchers in this
manner”. There were four models of consent: broad, study-by-study, menu, and dynamic con-
sent. The exact wording of the four consent scenarios is found in S3 Appendix. Two versions of
these four scenarios were presented; four where the consent description stood alone, and four
where the consent option was followed by this sentence: “You would (also) have access to a
website where you would be able to see what studies are going on, which studies are using your
information, and what each study has learned.”
When the consent models were displayed alone, similar fractions of respondents said they
would share samples and data under the study-by-study (72%), menu (75%), and dynamic
consent models (73%) (Fig 2) while 64% would share with the study under the broad consent
model. However, when the consent scenarios were accompanied by the statement about a web-
site that displays how samples and data are being used, there was essentially no difference in
support for the four consent models.
When asked about allowing different categories of researchers to use their samples and
information, people were most likely to say they would share with researchers at the NIH
(79%) and U.S. academic researchers (71%). There was more reluctance to share with “phar-
maceutical or drug company researchers” (52%) or “other government researchers” (44%).
The category “other government researchers” may be overly broad and non-specific; for exam-
ple, had the survey named researchers at specific health-related agencies, responses may have
differed. Consistent with two prior surveys, people were least willing to share with university
researchers in other countries (39%) [23, 24].

 In a separate question, 43% of people agreed that if their personal information was removed
first, they would be willing to have their “information and research results available on the
Internet to anyone”.
Involvement of Participants in Design and Conduct of the Study
To create a cohort study that addresses health related questions that are relevant to the lives of
participants, study designers are embracing new models of participants as partners in research.
Several questions addressed respondents’ interest in this area. A large majority (76%) agreed with
the statement “research participants and researchers should be equal partners in the study”.
Fig 3 shows that between 34% and 62% of respondents said that participants should be
involved in various phases of the study. Important to the most respondents was participant
involvement in three governance tasks—deciding what kinds of research are appropriate, decid-
ing what to do with study results, and deciding what research questions to answer. Between 35%
and 45% said they would like to be involved themselves in those three aspects of the study.
One in four people said that including research participants in planning and running the
study would increase their willingness to participate, including 18% of those people who said
earlier in the survey that they would not take part if asked. Another 17% said it would make
them less willing to take part if participants were included, and 58% said it would not affect
their decision.

 with cohort study participants. This survey reflects an early effort to understand the views and
preferences of potential participants toward the PMI cohort program. Findings from this sur-
vey were incorporated into the final report that the Precision Medicine Initiative Working
Group made to the National Institutes of Health, and are reflected in recommendations about
how the cohort study might be designed.[21] As such, the survey represents one of several
early efforts to engage the public in order to inform whether and how the PMI cohort study
might move forward.
Across most demographic groups this survey found consistent levels of support for and will-
ingness to participate in the PMI cohort study as it was described. The overall support (79%)
and willingness to take part (54%) observed are comparable to measures in previous public sur-
veys conducted using nationwide GfK samples in 2008 and 2012, which found overall support
for a large nationwide biobank at 84% and 83% respectively, and willingness to participate if
asked at 60% and 56% respectively [23, 25]. Support in this study could be lower than that mea-
sured in earlier surveys in part due to the explicitly stated association with the NIH (and thus
the federal government) in this survey, as well as high profile privacy breaches associated with
the federal government and health providers in the six months prior to the survey [29, 30]. Dif-
ferences in levels of support and willingness to participate might also result from this survey’s
mention of smartphones and activity trackers to collect data, especially among older respon-
dents, who had more concern about the privacy of electronic media (data not shown). This
study’s estimates of overall support and willingness to participate are also biased slightly
upward, since people with fewer years of education, who were underrepresented in the sample
compared to U.S. demographics, were less likely to support the study and participate. However,
extrapolating support and willingness observed in each category of education to U.S. census
frequencies of the education categories suggests the magnitude of inflation from this source is
less than 1% in both figures.
The findings suggest that certain groups including older Americans and those with lower
socioeconomic status may require additional engagement if they are to take part. However the
survey findings do not support the idea that people from communities that have historically
been understudied in research are not interested in participating in this cohort. In contrast, in
each demographic group in Table 1, at least one in eleven people (9%) said they would defi-
nitely participate if asked, would donate blood, and would take part for at least ten years. The
willingness to take part observed here is only the foundation for efforts needed to engage,
recruit and retain people in traditionally underrepresented groups. Researchers likely must
work as part of communities that have been underrepresented, if those communities are going
to feel and be a part of the study. [17] To this end, scientists may consider adopting language
and policies that bond researchers and potential participants together todesign and govern the
study [17, 31].
Thirty percent of survey respondents shifted their opinions about their willingness to take
part in the study from the beginning to the end of the survey. This suggests that considering
some of the potential risks and benefits of participation may inform and influence people’s
decision to take part. Engagement before and during study recruitment may help people make
better informed decisions about participation.
The observation that receipt of health information was the most important incentive was
consistent with results of a 2008 nationwide survey [23]. Maximizing information shared with
research participants will be a key challenge of the PMI. Survey respondents expressed interest
in a wide range of information, including but not limited to genetic information. Laboratory
measurements such as blood sugar were seen as equally interesting. The return of information
may also benefit research, encouraging participants to stay engaged and enrolled, and to take
part in other research studies based on their results.

 There was considerable enthusiasm among respondents about participant involvement in
different phases of the study. Between 19% and 45% said they themselves would take part in
various study related functions. The tasks of greatest interest to the most people were gover-
nance-related. Developing “participants as equal partners” may not drastically improve enroll-
ment. However it may establish the kind of study identity and enthusiasm that others have
cited as one key to the success of this effort [16–18, 21].
NIH researchers were found to be trusted with the data and samples to be collected. If the
NIH serves as a leader in the PMI cohort, it must be prepared to understand and meet those
expectations. For example, if PMI cohort data are shared with foreign academics, study leaders
may need to address negative attitudes about such sharing, perhaps by engaging the public to
understand their reservations, and explaining how the sharing benefits U.S. medicine and
research.
Limitations
It is very important to note that the results of this survey were not meant to, and do not accu-
rately predict what portion of American adults would take part in the PMI cohort study if they
were asked. First, although half of respondents said they would take part in PMI if asked, only
54% of the sample contacted for this survey agreed to participate. Second, respondents in this
survey are members of the GfK panel; they may be more favorably inclined toward research
participation than the general population. This limitation is inherent in most studies of atti-
tudes about taking part in biomedical research, since people must be willing to take part in a
survey study like this one to collect such data. On the other hand, the bias may not be particu-
larly strong since sharing opinions on a survey is likely to be a smaller, lower risk commitment
than sharing ones’ biospecimens and medical data. Third, people’s stated willingness to take
part in a hypothetical study will not correlate perfectly with actual behaviors. The PMI study
should not be expected to enjoy a 54% success rate in its recruitment based on these data.
Given the limitations of the survey, the data likely provide valid estimates of support for the
study as well as the relative willingness of different groups to participate, the relative impor-
tance of different incentives, and the relative acceptability of different consent models.
