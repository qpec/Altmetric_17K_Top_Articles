Human workers ensure the functioning of governments around
the world. The efficacy of human workers, in turn, is linked to
the climatic conditions they face. Here we show that the same
weather that amplifies human health hazards also reduces street-
level government workers’ oversight of these hazards. To do
so, we employ US data from over 70 million regulatory police
stops between 2000 and 2017, from over 500,000 fatal vehicu-
lar crashes between 2001 and 2015, and from nearly 13 million
food safety violations across over 4 million inspections between
2012 and 2016. We find that cold and hot temperatures increase
fatal crash risk and incidence of food safety violations while also
decreasing police stops and food safety inspections. Added pre-
cipitation increases fatal crash risk while also decreasing police
stops. We examine downscaled general circulation model output
to highlight the possible day-to-day governance impacts of cli-
mate change by 2050 and 2099. Future warming may augment
regulatory oversight during cooler seasons. During hotter sea-
sons, however, warming may diminish regulatory oversight while
simultaneously amplifying the hazards government workers are
tasked with overseeing.

ay-to-day regulatory governance supports the functioning of
society (1). Insufficient government oversight can worsen
health outcomes (2), amplify environmental degradation (3),
diminish public safety (4), and hamper government performance
(5). Critically, regulatory governance cannot occur without those
who enforce the rules (6). Street-level government workers,
using their own discretion (7, 8), enforce government rules and
policies in their communities (9). These government workers
have physiological and psychological limitations (1), political
biases (6, 10), and personal strategic goals (11). They are—in
short—human.
Government workers—like other workers (12, 13)—likely
experience the productivity-diminishing physiological (14) and
psychological (15) effects of environmental stress. Adverse cli-
matic conditions harm human well-being (16). Hot temperatures
undermine cognitive performance (17), reduce hours worked
(18), and diminish overall output (19, 20). If realized, weather-
related reductions in government worker efficacy will likely occur
simultaneously with increased demand for their social services.
Climate change is also likely to worsen general societal well-
being (16) by amplifying the occurrence of violent crime and
interpersonal conflict (21) and by worsening the public health
risks faced by citizens (14, 22).
These facts combine to suggest that the same environmental
stressors likely to increase the citizenry’s need for effective gov-
ernance may also reduce the ability of government workers to
respond to those needs. To investigate this possibility, we mea-
sure the effect of meteorological conditions on US regulatory
enforcement across over 70 million police stops between 2000 and
2017 and across over 4 million food safety inspections between
2012 and 2016. We also examine the effect of the weather on
vehicular crashes and food safety compliance, hazards these gov-
ernment inspectors are tasked with overseeing. (Our publicly
available data and replication materials are available on Harvard
University’s Dataverse at https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/G1BMI8.
The proprietary food safety data can be obtained from the firm
Hazel Analytics.) Using these data, we examine three questions.
First, does adverse weather induce fewer regulatory stops by
police officers at the same time as it amplifies the public health
risks from vehicular accidents and violent crime? Second, does
adverse weather reduce the probability of food safety inspections
at the same time as it increases the risk of food-borne illness?
Finally, might future warming alter the ability of government
workers to respond to the public health and safety risks posed
by climate change?
Results
Police Stops. To investigate whether outside weather conditions
alter police officers’ behavior, we use daily police stops in the
United States between 2000 and 2017 (23) (Fig. 1A). We include
data from counties with fewer than 30 days of zero stops in total
from all states that report county and date of stop [our results are
robust to the inclusion of those counties with infrequent record-
ing of stops as well (SI Appendix, Tables S1–S8)]. These data
increase in size over time due to amplified rates of police depart-
ment stop reporting (23). The counties included in the data cover
approximately 56% of the current US population.
We combine these policing outcome data—marked by day
and geolocated to the county level—with meteorological data
from two sources. The PRISM Climate Group provides gridded
(at ∼4 km) daily maximum and minimum temperatures (in
degrees Celsius) as well as daily sum-total precipitation (in
millimeters) for the continental United States (24). The sec-
ond source, the National Centers for Environmental Prediction
Significance
Public servants are often first responders to disasters, and the
day-to-day completion of their jobs aids public health and
safety. However, with respect to their individual psychological
and physiological responses to environmental stressors, public
sector workers may be harmed in much the same way as other
citizens in society. We find that exposure to hotter tempera-
tures reduces the activity of two groups of regulators—police
officers and food safety inspectors—at times that the risks they
are tasked with overseeing are highest. Given that we observe
these effects in a country with high political institutionaliza-
tion, our findings may have implications for the impacts of
climate change on the functioning of regulatory governance in
countries with lower political and economic development.

(NCEP) Reanalysis II project, provides gridded daily average
cloud cover, average relative humidity, and average wind speed
over the same period (25). Of note, measurement error may exist
between gridded weather observations and the weather individ-
uals actually experienced, possibly attenuating the magnitude of
our estimates (26).
Our theoretical relationship of interest is the effect of weather
conditions on the number of police stops in a given county on a
given day. We empirically model this relationship as
Yijts = f (TMAXijts) + g(PRECIPijts) + Zη
+ αi + µt + νjs + �ijts.
[1]
In this time-series cross-sectional model, i indexes counties, j
indexes states, t indexes calendar days, and s indexes calendar
months. Our dependent variable Yijts represents the log number
of police stops in county i in state j on calendar day t within
calendar month s. Our independent variables of interest are
maximum daily temperature, TMAXijts, and daily precipitation,
PRECIPijts. We also control for temperature range, percentage
of cloud cover, relative humidity, and average wind speed, rep-
resented via Zη, as failure to do so may bias our estimates of
the effect of maximum temperatures and precipitation on our
outcome measure (27).
Observable and unobservable unit-specific, geographic, or
temporal factors may influence our outcome measures in a way
that correlates with the weather. For example, officers might
encounter higher rates of legal infractions in counties with
warmer average temperatures for reasons unrelated to those
warmer average temperatures. To ensure that these unit-specific
factors do not bias our estimates of the effect of weather on
policing outcomes, we include αi—representing county indicator
variables—in Eq. 1. These variables control for all time-invariant
unobserved characteristics for each county (28). Further, there
may be unobserved daily considerations or state-specific sea-
sonal or secular trends influencing our policing outcomes that
could spuriously correlate with the weather. To control for these
potential confounds we include µt and νjs in Eq. 1, representing
calendar date and state-by-calendar month indicator variables,
respectively.
Our empirical identifying assumption, consistent with the cli-
mate econometrics literature (18, 19, 27), is that the remaining
variation in daily maximum temperature and precipitation is as
good as random after conditioning on these fixed effects (see
SI Appendix, Deconvolved Temperature for a depiction of this
process). The estimated model coefficients from f (TMAXijts)
and g(PRECIPijts) can thus be interpreted as the causal effects
of maximum temperature and precipitation on the number of
police stops in a county day (16).
We estimate Eq. 1 using ordinary least squares and adjust
for possible spatial and serial correlation in �ijts by employing
heteroskedasticity-robust SEs clustered at the state level (28).
We omit nonclimatic control variables from Eq. 1 because of
their potential to generate bias in our parameters of interest (21,
27, 29). Finally, our results are similar across the substitution of
the National Weather Service (NWS) Heat Index (30)—a mea-
sure of heat stress—for maximum temperature and humidity.
See SI Appendix, Tables S1–S8 for results.
To engage in regulatory stops and inspections, government
workers must expose themselves to ambient environmental con-
ditions. Because of nonlinear human preferences for physical
activity (31) and supply of labor (18) as a function of maximum
temperatures, we adopt a nonlinear functional form estimated
via a quadratic fit, f (), for the effect of maximum temperature
on daily police stops. Similarly, due to the linear effect of added
precipitation on physical activity rates (31), we model the rela-
tionship between precipitation and police stops, g(), linearly (we
provide further support for our parametric modeling choices
and justify our parametric assumptions in SI Appendix, Flexible
Functional Forms).
Of note, the marginal regulatory gaps we present highlight the
divergence in the slopes of the marginal effects curves we esti-
mate via Eq. 1 for each outcome. Because of the fixed effects
we employ in our analysis, the intercepts of these curves are
arbitrary. We are unable to estimate the absolute magnitude or
direction of the enforcement gap. The diverging slopes of the
curves, not the absolute magnitude of the gap, are our analytic
focus. As a result, we set the marginal effects curves in Figs. 2 and
3 tangent to one another for ease of inspection of the divergence
of their slopes.
The results of estimating Eq. 1 for the effect of maximum
temperatures on police stops indicate that temperature non-
linearly relates to the log number of police stops on a given
county day. Stops increase up to their maximum at 29 ◦C and
decline past that point (Fig. 2A, P < 0.001, n = 938,273).
This closely mirrors the functional form observed between
maximum temperatures and participation in physical activity
among a representative sample of the US population (31).
Fig. 2B displays that stops decline linearly with increases in
daily precipitation (coefficient −0.012, P < 0.001). See SI
Appendix, Tables S1–S8 and SI Appendix, Marginal Effects for
additional estimation results. Putting scale to the magnitude
of our estimated relationship, a +10 ◦C shift from a maxi-
mum temperature of 30 ◦C to 40 ◦C produces a reduction
in stops that represents an approximately 1.5% reduction in

log number of stops compared with their mean value in our
sample.
Adverse temperatures and precipitation reduce the number
of regulatory police stops in our sample. Do these meteorolog-
ical conditions simultaneously amplify the public health risks
officers are tasked with overseeing, like violent crime and vehicu-
lar crashes? Previous studies have found a predominantly linear
relationship between higher temperatures and increases in vio-
lent crime (21, 32). Extrapolating from that literature indicates
the possible existence of a regulatory gap between marginal offi-
cer effort and the marginal added occurrence of violent crime at
high temperatures.
Fatal Vehicular Crashes. Similarly, in some settings vehicular
crashes have been linked to adverse weather conditions (33, 34),
possibly resulting from the impacts of higher temperatures on
driver fatigue (35, 36). To the extent that erratic driving behavior
is observable before a crash (37), added officer oversight might
be able to diminish crash hazards (38). To examine the nature of
the potential marginal regulatory effort gap between officer stops
and added crash hazard, we use county-level daily incidence of
fatal crashes between 2001 and 2015 from the National Highway
Traffic Safety Administration’s Fatality Analysis Reporting Sys-
tem (Fig. 1B). The counties included in these data cover 100%
of the current continental US population. We combine these
crash outcome data with our meteorological data and estimate
Eq. 1 as a linear probability model of the effects of maximum
temperatures and precipitation on the probability of fatal crash
occurrence.
Our estimates indicate that temperature nonlinearly relates
to the probability of a fatal crash on a given county day. The
marginal effect of maximum temperatures on fatal crash risk
decreases to a minimum at 0 ◦C and increases beyond that
point (Fig. 2B, P < 0.001, n = 17,022,516). Fig. 2B displays

our outcome variables. Due to the fixed effects in our analysis, the placement of these marginal effects curves on the y axis is arbitrary; we set the curves
tangent to one another for ease of inspection of the divergence of their slopes. Gray shaded areas depict the gap in marginal regulatory effort created by
the divergence of these relationships. See SI Appendix, Marginal Effects and SI Appendix, Tables S1–S8 for the 95% confidence intervals associated with the

that crash risk increases linearly with added daily precipitation
(coefficient 0.005, P < 0.001). See SI Appendix, Tables S1–S8
and SI Appendix, Marginal Effects for additional results. These
effect sizes mean that a +10 ◦C shift from a maximum tem-
perature of 30 ◦C to 40 ◦C produces an amplified risk of fatal
crash of half a percentage point, an increase that represents an
approximately 17% increase compared with their mean in our
sample.
Absent any changes in police officer productivity due to hot
temperatures, we should observe that stops increase with the
risks officers are tasked with overseeing. Under ideal regulatory
effort, our stops line in Fig. 2A should look similar in shape to
the line representing vehicular risk. That we observe decreas-
ing stops due to high temperatures—despite the expectation that
stops should be higher due to increasing numbers of violations—
leaves the conclusion that officer productivity is the likely reason
for the reduction in stops we observe.
Thus, our results indicate that the meteorological conditions
that produce the highest risk of crime and vehicular crashes also
reduce police oversight of these risks. Yet police officers are only
one category of street-level bureaucrat tasked with overseeing
citizens’ well-being. Health inspectors represent another group
of government workers assigned to daily enforcement of public
safety regulations. Might their work also be affected by adverse
weather conditions?
Food Safety Inspections. Food-borne illness represents a substan-
tial source of morbidity and mortality in the United States (39).
Further, higher ambient temperatures systematically increase
the risk of food-borne illness from pathogenic Escherichia coli,
Campylobacter, and Salmonella via amplified rates of pathogenic
cell division (40, 41). To investigate whether the weather reduces
health inspectors’ oversight of food safety at points of maxi-
mum public risk, we use daily incidence of food safety inspec-
tions between 2012 and 2016 from the firm Hazel Analytics
(Fig. 1C). The counties included in our food safety data cover
approximately 86% of the current US population.
We combine inspection incidence with our meteorological
data and estimate Eq. 1 as a linear probability model of the
effects of maximum temperatures and precipitation on food
safety inspection probability [results are robust to aggregation
to the county level (SI Appendix, Tables S1–S8)]. As this model
is at the facility-day unit of analysis, we replace county-level
effects with facility-level effects (represented by αi). Our estima-
tion strategy otherwise remains the same. As with police stops,
we nonlinearly parameterize the relationship between inspec-
tion probability and maximum temperatures as inspectors must
experience ambient environmental conditions to complete their
inspections (31).
The resulting estimates indicate that, as for regulatory police
stops, temperature nonlinearly relates to the probability of a food
safety inspection on a given facility day. Inspection probability
increases to a maximum at 26 ◦C and decreases beyond that
point (Fig. 3A, P < 0.001, n = 1,176,731,121). Fig. 3B displays
that probability of inspection decreases linearly with added daily
precipitation (coefficient −0.0003, P = 0.002). See SI Appendix,
Tables S1–S3 and SI Appendix, Marginal Effects for additional
estimation results. Holding other things constant, a +10 ◦C shift
from a maximum temperature of 30 ◦C to 40 ◦C, scaled across
the over 750,000 facilities in our sample, would translate into
approximately 8,000 fewer facilities inspected per day.
Food Safety Violations. Previous studies have found a relationship
between reported cases of food poisoning and higher ambi-
ent temperatures (41), suggesting the highest food-borne illness
morbidity risk occurs at portions of the temperature distribu-
tion where inspection probability declines. Do actual citations
for improper food safety procedures also increase with ambi-
ent temperature? To investigate this question, we examine the
effect of meteorological conditions on the number of food safety
violations given per inspection.
We again estimate Eq. 1 at the facility-day unit of analysis, with
the number of inspections per violation as our outcome mea-
sure [results are robust to dichotomizing our outcome variable
and running a linear probability model as well as aggregation
to the county level (SI Appendix, Tables S1–S8)]. Increasing
temperatures nonlinearly increase the number of food safety vio-
lations per inspection, with largest marginal effects at the hotter
portions of the temperature distribution. Our estimates of the
marginal effects of maximum temperature on number of viola-
tions have high statistical uncertainty over the colder part of the
temperature distribution (see Fig. 3A, P = 0.009, n = 4,101,987
and SI Appendix, Tables S1–S8 and SI Appendix, Marginal Effects
for additional estimation results). Fig. 3B displays the insignifi-
cant relationship between added daily precipitation and number
of food safety violations (coefficient 0.0003, P = 0.334). Putting
scale to these effects, a +10 ◦C shift from a maximum tempera-
ture of 30 ◦C to 40 ◦C would represent a 3% increase in number
of violations compared with the mean number of violations per
inspection in our sample.
As for police stops and vehicular risks, under ideal regulatory
effort, our inspections line in Fig. 3A should be similar in shape to
the line representing food safety violation risk. That we observe
decreasing probability of inspection due to high temperatures—
despite the expectation that inspections should increase due to
amplified risk of violations—suggests that lowered health inspec-
tor productivity is responsible for the reduction in probability of
inspection we observe.
Thus, across two separate public safety domains we observe
decreases in government worker oversight at portions of meteo-
rological distributions associated with peak public safety risk.
Climate change is likely to shift the distribution of future daily
temperatures. Might these shifts alter the needs of citizens at
the same time as they alter the ability of government workers
to respond to citizens in their time of need?
Potential Climate Change Impacts. To examine this question, we
use NASA Earth Exchange’s (NEX-Global Daily Downscaled
Projections) bias-corrected, statistically downscaled (to 25 km ×
25 km), daily maximum temperature projections for 2010, 2050,
and 2099 (42) drawn from 21 of the Coupled Model Intercompar-
ison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) models (43) run on the Represen-
tative Concentration Pathways high-emissions scenario (RCP8.5)
(44) (we repeat our projections using the RCP4.5 scenario in
SI Appendix, Climate Impact Projections). Using these data, we
project the impacts of climatic changes by 2050 and 2099 on each
of our regulatory and public safety outcomes, respectively.
We calculate our projection of the change in our outcome
measures by 2050 due to climate change (∆Y2050) as
∆Yg2050 = f (TMAXkgt2050) − f (TMAXkgt2010)
[2]
and for the effect from 2010 to 2099 (∆Y2099) as
∆Yg2099 = f (TMAXkgt2099) − f (TMAXkgt2010),
[3]
where k indexes the 21 specific climate models, g indexes grid
cells, and t indexes the day of year. Further, TMAXkgt repre-
sents projected maximum temperature and f () represents the
fitted maximum temperature quadratic function from the esti-
mation of Eq. 1 across our historical outcome measures. This
estimation procedure allows us to smooth across the uncertainty
regarding underlying global circulation model projections (45).
(Of note, while smoothing across the CMIP5 model ensemble
likely adjusts for the majority of idiosyncratic interannual natural
variability contained within any single global circulation model,
our projections for 2050 may be subject to loss in precision due
to remaining idiosyncratic interannual variability. This should be
considered when evaluating projection results.)
Fig. 4 displays the results of this procedure across each of our
four regulatory outcomes. On average, we project police officer
stops (Fig. 4A) to decrease in the South and increase in the North

Projected change in regulatory behaviors and outcomes in the United States due to future warming. Shown are the 25-km × 25-km grid cell
projections of the effects of warming in the United States over this century on the regulatory outcomes examined in this study. Projections are calculated
using downscaled climatic model data from NASA’s NEX under the RCP8.5 high-emissions scenario across the mean of the 21 CMIP5 models in the ensemble.
We couple these climate model data with the estimates from our historical statistical models to project the mean effects of climate change on each outcome.

depicts projected changes to food safety violations. Annual averages smooth the seasonal variation in these outcomes (see SI Appendix, Climate Impact
Projections for by-season projections).
of the United States at the same time as we project fatal crash
risk (Fig. 4B) to increase most in the US South. Further, we
project food safety inspections (Fig. 4C) to decline in the South
and increase in the North of the United States while we project
food safety violations to increase most in the US South. Thus, we
project the US South may experience greater regulatory stressors
due to future climatic changes than we project for the northern
portions of the country.
However, these annualized projections mask the temporal het-
erogeneity associated with our seasonal projections. We plot our
projections for each outcome, across both RCP4.5 and RCP8.5,
for each month in the years 2050 and 2099 in SI Appendix,
Climate Impact Projections. We project future winter months
may see the largest increases in regulator activity and small-
est increases in health hazards, while future summer months
may see net decreases in regulator activity while simultane-
ously experiencing the largest increase in human health hazards.
Ultimately, we project that future warming may improve regula-
tory capacity during colder seasons and worsen it during hotter
seasons.
Discussion
Adverse meteorological conditions worsen human physiological
and psychological well-being (16), and historical data indicate
government workers are no exception. Our analyses demon-
strate a robust link between temperature and precipitation and
the regulatory behavior of US street-level government workers.
Cold and hot temperatures and added precipitation significantly
reduce the number of police stops and diminish the probability of
a visit from a health inspector. Further, such adverse meteorolog-
ical conditions also worsen the risks—car crashes and food safety
violations—these regulators are tasked with overseeing. Histori-
cal weather conditions that increased social need for government
oversight reduced the supply of these regulatory services. Finally,
our projections using global circulation model output suggest
that warming over this century may reduce cold-season regula-
tory inefficiencies and may increase inefficiencies during hotter
seasons when the added public health risks from climate change
may be most acute (22).
Several considerations are important to the interpretation of
our results. First, while we have data from millions of regula-
tory stops and inspections across two broad areas of government
oversight, ideal data would also measure effort and output from
other types of government workers (e.g., politicians, financial
regulators, soldiers, government researchers, etc.) to enable
estimating the total effect of adverse weather on the efficiency
of governance. Moreover, observed output is only one measure
of government worker performance. Additional desirable mea-
sures include the demeanor and attentiveness with which they
conduct their duties (7).
Second, our data do not enable precisely measuring sub-
stitution or targeting of regulatory effort. Police officers may
respond more to violent crime than to vehicular infractions
on particularly hot days. An ideal dataset would allow us to
measure potential substitution in officer effort. Further, food
safety inspectors might choose to inspect smaller numbers of
the worst violating facilities in hotter temperatures instead of
larger numbers of lower-risk facilities. In SI Appendix, Exam-
ination of Potential Targeting we examine whether targeting is
occurring in our food safety data. Our findings suggest that
regulators are not engaging in significant amounts of target-
ing at high temperatures and that—as a result—targeting is
not likely driving our results. Importantly, even in the face
of attempts at strategic reallocation of regulatory resources,
marginal regulation of vehicular and food safety risks declines
in the hot temperatures that amplify these risks overall, leav-
ing a gap in regulatory effort in two important public safety
domains.
Third, our data are restricted to observations from a rich,
highly institutionalized country with a temperate climate and
substantial public sector resources. It is critical to repeat this
analysis where possible in poorer countries with warmer average
climates (46), lower levels of public sector institutionalization
and resources (47), and higher levels of street-level bureaucratic
discretion (5) as such countries may experience markedly larger
effects of meteorological conditions on government worker
output (48).
Fourth, historically observed effects may not persist into the
future. Humans may adapt technologically and physiologically to
warmer climates (49, 50). Political systems that can afford to do
so may assign added budgetary resources to street-level enforce-
ment. The future of work may be quite different from what it is
today (51), and regulatory governance may be conducted in man-
ners less susceptible to environmental stressors. Certain health
hazards produced by environmental stressors—like added risk
of fatal crash—may also be diminished in the future through
technological advances (52). When coupled with the uncertain-
ties inherent in the projections of future climate, these points

illustrate that our projections should be interpreted with caution.
The future is likely to be markedly different from the present in
ways that are difficult to project with precision.
However, our historical data indicate that even a rich coun-
try like the United States has not yet fully optimized regulatory
response in the face of environmental stress. Future capacity for
adaptation may also be challenged by relatively slower economic
growth due to climatic stressors (19, 53, 54) that could diminish
the public service budgets needed to address the environmental
stressors such as drought, floods, tropical cyclones, severe heat-
waves, and sea-level rise that are likely to be exacerbated by a
changing climate (55–58).
Scholars of politics have thus far primarily examined the
potential for climate change to produce extreme political conse-
quences such as protest, civil conflict, and state failure (21, 59).
Extreme political disruption, however, is a rare occurrence that
results from a complex chain of prior stressors. Regular, day-
to-day effects of exposure to more extreme climates—and the
failure of governance to adequately respond—can both prove
independently costly and causally set the stage (60) for more
marked societal disruption. Ultimately, if observed relationships
from the recent past persist, further climate change may increase
the gap between government oversight and citizen need during
hotter times of the year, diminishing adaptation capacity and
possibly magnifying the severity of the social impacts of climate
change.
