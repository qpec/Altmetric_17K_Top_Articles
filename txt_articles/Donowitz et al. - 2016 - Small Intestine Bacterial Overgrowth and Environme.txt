ABSTRACT
Recent studies suggest small intestine bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) is common among developing world children.
SIBO’s pathogenesis and effect in the developing world are unclear. Our objective was to determine the prevalence of SIBO in
Bangladeshi children and its association with malnutrition. Secondary objectives included determination of SIBO’s association
with sanitation, diarrheal disease, and environmental enteropathy. We performed a cross-sectional analysis of 90 Bangladeshi
2-year-olds monitored since birth from an impoverished neighborhood. SIBO was diagnosed via glucose hydrogen breath test-
ing, with a cutoff of a 12-ppm increase over baseline used for SIBO positivity. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to
investigate SIBO predictors. Differences in concomitant inflammation and permeability between SIBO-positive and -negative
children were compared with multiple comparison adjustment. A total of 16.7% (15/90) of the children had SIBO. The strongest
predictors of SIBO were decreased length-for-age Z score since birth (odds ratio [OR], 0.13; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.03 to
0.60) and an open sewer outside the home (OR, 4.78; 95% CI, 1.06 to 21.62). Recent or frequent diarrheal disease did not predict
SIBO. The markers of intestinal inflammation fecal Reg 1� (116.8 versus 65.6 �g/ml; P � 0.02) and fecal calprotectin (1,834.6
versus 766.7 �g/g; P � 0.004) were elevated in SIBO-positive children. Measures of intestinal permeability and systemic inflam-
mation did not differ between the groups. These findings suggest linear growth faltering and poor sanitation are associated with
SIBO independently of recent or frequent diarrheal disease. SIBO is associated with intestinal inflammation but not increased
permeability or systemic inflammation.
IMPORTANCE
A total of 165 million children worldwide are considered stunted, which is associated with increased risk of death
prior to age 5 years and cognitive disability. Stunting has, in part, been attributed to the presence of environmental enteropathy.
Environmental enteropathy is a poorly understood condition leading to chronic intestinal inflammation. It has been postulated
that small intestine bacterial overgrowth contributes to the pathogenesis of environmental enteropathy as overgrowth has been
associated with intestinal inflammation and micronutrient malabsorption when it develops in other clinical contexts. This study
confirms the finding that overgrowth occurs at high rates in the developing world. This is the first study to show that overgrowth
is associated with intestinal inflammation and linear growth delay in this setting and is the first to examine why children with no
known gastrointestinal dysfunction develop overgrowth from the developing world environment.

S
mall intestine bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) is defined as
greater than 105 CFU/ml upper intestinal aspirate as assessed
by both anaerobic and aerobic cultures (1). SIBO can be measured
by culture of endoscopically obtained upper gastrointestinal (GI)
aspirates or noninvasively by hydrogen breath testing. Tradition-
ally, SIBO has been considered a secondary condition that devel-
ops in the setting of altered intestinal anatomy, slowed intestinal
motility, or aberrant gastrointestinal function. SIBO in this setting
has been associated with poor nutritional outcomes, including
steatorrhea with loss of fat-soluble vitamins (excluding vitamin K)
(2–9), carbohydrate malabsorption (10–13), and a protein-losing
enteropathy (14–18). Deficiencies in cobalamin (19–21), thia-
mine (22), riboflavin (18), pyridoxine (18), and nicotinamide
(23) have been documented. SIBO has also been shown to lead to
increased GI permeability (24, 25) and alteration of mucosal im-
munity, including an increase in IgA plasma cells and increased
mucosal interleukin-6 (IL-6) (26, 27). SIBO has recently been rec-
ognized as an underdiagnosed condition in children in the devel-
oped world with gastrointestinal symptoms (28).
Recently, preliminary studies have suggested that children in

 the lower socioeconomic strata of developing world countries
may develop SIBO at significantly higher rates than their more
privileged counterparts, with a prevalence of up to 30% in slum-
dwelling children (29–31). SIBO in children from low-income
countries has been associated with poor carbohydrate absorption
and underperformance of an oral cholera vaccine (32–34). The
pathogenesis of SIBO in developing world children with no un-
derlying intestinal pathology remains unclear. It is also unclear
what role SIBO plays in environmental enteropathy (EE), an in-
flammatory intestinal disorder of the developing world that has
been implicated in growth failure and poor neurocognitive out-
comes (35–38).
In this study, we sought to test the prevalence of SIBO and its
potential association with malnutrition, sanitation, and diarrheal
disease. We also ought to determine SIBO’s association with con-
comitant gut inflammation, intestinal permeability, and systemic
inflammation. It was our primary hypothesis that development of
SIBO in this setting would be associated with poor nutrition, poor
sanitation, and recent or frequent diarrheal episodes. Our second-
ary hypothesis was that SIBO was associated with intestinal in-
flammation, increased intestinal permeability, and systemic in-
flammation.
RESULTS
Enrollment characteristics. A total of 103 children were assessed
for SIBO testing. Of note, none had known chronic gastrointesti-
nal disease. Nine children were excluded for a weight-for-age Z
(WAZ) score of ��3 standard deviations (SD) and were referred
for nutritional therapy. One parent refused testing. Three children
were unable to complete testing for the 3-h test period and were
excluded from analysis. A total of 90 children successfully com-
peted SIBO testing. The average age of children tested was
24.6 months (range, 24.3 to 25.1 months). Of the children tested,
46 (51%) were female. Birth demographics of the children showed
an average estimated gestational age of 37.3 weeks with an average
length and weight at enrollment of 48.9 cm and 2.8 kg, respec-
tively. Mothers had an average age of 24.5 years, and 82 (91%)
considered themselves housewives. The average monthly house-
hold income was 13,913 Bangladeshi taka (approximately $179
U.S. dollars). The average number of people living per room in
homes was 3.8. There was no significant difference in the enroll-
ment characteristics between SIBO-positive and SIBO-negative
children (Table 1) or between these 90 children and the 700 chil-
dren in the full PROVIDE cohort (data not shown). Of note, data
on estimated gestational age were not collected for the entire co-
hort of 700 children and thus were unavailable for comparison.
SIBO was associated with growth faltering and lack of sani-
tation. The prevalence of SIBO in our cohort was 16.7% (15/90).
Figure 1 shows the glucose hydrogen breath test results from both
SIBO-positive and SIBO-negative children. Children with SIBO
had significantly worse linear growth (stunting) from enrollment
to age 2 years compared to children without SIBO. A 1-U drop in
length-for-age Z (LAZ) score from enrollment to 2 years con-
ferred an odds ratio (OR) of 7.69 (95% confidence interval [CI],
1.67 to 33.33) for the development of SIBO.
The odds of developing SIBO were increased by the presence of
an open drain/sewer outside the home (OR, 4.78; 95% CI, 1.06 to
21.62). Odds of developing SIBO were also increased by the
household’s drinking water being obtained from a source other
than the municipal water supply and by the mother cutting her
fingernails less than once a month. Because of the low number of
households with a water source other than the municipal supply
and the low number of mothers who did not cut their nails at least
once a month (1 per group and 2 per group, respectively), the 95%
CI for these OR was extremely large, making estimation of odds
unreliable despite their significance.
Weight faltering (negative change in WAZ score from enroll-
ment to 2 years), socioeconomic status (income), and diarrheal
disease (number of diarrheal episodes in the child’s life or pres-
ence of a diarrheal episode in the 30 days prior to SIBO testing)
were not significant predictors of SIBO (Table 2).
SIBO was associated with concomitant intestinal inflamma-
tion but not increased intestinal permeability or systemic in-
flammation. Mean fecal Reg 1� was 116.8 �g/ml in the SIBO-
positive group compared to 65.6 �g/ml in SIBO-negative children
(P � 0.02). Fecal calprotectin was also significantly increased in
SIBO-positive children compared to the SIBO-negative group
(mean of 1,834.6 versus 766.7 �g/g, respectively; P � 0.004)
(Fig. 2).
While SIBO-positive children had significantly increased
markers of intestinal inflammation, there was no difference in
lactose/mannitol (L/M) ratios between SIBO-positive and SIBO-
negative children. Likewise, there was no difference in C-reactive
protein or any of the 17 cytokines measured between the groups
(data not shown). Anthropometry results at the time of SIBO

DISCUSSION
Our study demonstrates that SIBO in a developing world setting is
associated with growth faltering, poor sanitation, and intestinal
inflammation. Poor growth and intestinal inflammation are en-
demic in children from low-income countries, and the impor-
tance of this work derives from its identification of SIBO as a
potentially treatable contributor to these problems of child mor-
bidity. Of note, our findings are contradictory to other investiga-
tions which found an increase in intestinal permeability in adults
with SIBO in the developed world (24, 25, 39). However, patients
in previous studies had underlying gastrointestinal disease that
may have predisposed them to increased intestinal permeability.
The lack of increased L/M ratios in SIBO is also interesting because
L/M ratios were increased in previous studies of EE (38, 40). This
may indicate that SIBO and EE are separate but concomitant con-
ditions or that EE is actually a syndrome encompassing a hetero-
geneous group of environmentally derived intestinal inflamma-
tory conditions with variable manifestations but common
outcomes. Furthermore, even SIBO-negative children in our co-
hort had fecal calprotectin levels that were elevated from those
reported in asymptomatic children in the developed world, sug-
gesting that the majority of children in our study population had
some degree of EE (41).
This work is the first to investigate factors that may predispose
developing world children with no known gastrointestinal pathol-
ogy to SIBO. The significance of growth stunting in our model
demonstrates an association between linear growth delay and
overgrowth independent of diarrheal disease and sanitation.
However, in the absence of longitudinal analysis, the details of this
association remain unclear. Given the known nutritional conse-
quences of SIBO in other settings, it is biologically plausible that
SIBO plays a causative role in growth stunting. It is also possible
that a variable we did not measure in our analysis leads to both
SIBO and declining LAZ and thus is acting as a confounder in our
model.
We designed our regression model to investigate two compet-
ing hypotheses on why children would develop SIBO from their
environment. The first hypothesis was that children develop SIBO

 due to lumenal stasis secondary to gastroparesis or ileus after re-
cent or recurrent enteric infection. This is biologically plausible
given that children in Bangladesh have a mean of 4.7 diarrheal
episodes and a median of 3.3 enteric pathogens identified in non-
diarrheal stools in the first year of life alone (42). The second
hypothesis that has been suggested is that children develop a func-
tional motility disorder with a hypoactive migrating motor com-
plex and decreased intestinal contractility due to constant lipo-
polysaccharide exposure from an unsanitary environment (43).
This phenomenon has been shown to occur in animal models and
in women with late radiation enteropathy (44–46). Our analysis
suggests that recent or frequent enteric infection does not predis-
pose to SIBO, while measures of environmental contamination
do. Although we did not test motility in this study, our results
suggest this endeavor might be fruitful in future investigation.
To date, literature on environmentally derived SIBO in the
developing world is sparse. It has been shown that SIBO occurs in
the lower socioeconomic strata of developing world countries
with increased prevalence compared to countries with greater fi-
nancial means (29–31). SIBO in this setting has been shown to
lead to poor carbohydrate absorption and oral vaccine underper-
formance (32–34). It has also been shown to have increased prev-
alence in severe malnutrition (47). Much of our understanding of
the pathogenesis of SIBO comes from studies in the developed
world in patients with underlying gastrointestinal pathology.
While these studies are extremely informative, it is important to
understand that the pathogenesis and pathophysiology of SIBO in
developing world children with no underlying gastrointestinal
disease may be different from those of patients in industrialized
countries.
Our study has several important limitations. First, the natural
history of overgrowth in the developing world setting is unknown.
It may be present until treated as in underlying gastrointestinal
disease or may have a waxing and waning course. Thus, a cross-
sectional analysis that detects children with SIBO only at the time
of testing may miss children who have had recent or prolonged
SIBO in their lifetime. Second, we did not collect data on recent
antibiotic use that may be a confounder in our analysis. Third, a
cutoff of 12 ppm for the hydrogen breath test used to diagnose
SIBO is based on adult studies in the developed world and may not
be optimal for our pediatric and developing world study environ-
ment. Currently, there is no evidence-based cutoff for SIBO diag-
nosis specific to developing world children. Fourth, our sample
size was too low to obtain reliable odds ratios for several of the
covariates tested, despite their significance. Finally, the inability to
test children with a WAZ of ��3 SD may introduce selection bias
into our study given that we did not evaluate children with the
most severe outcomes.
Strengths of this study include duplicate measures intestinal
and systemic inflammation. Use of the PROVIDE database for
data on predictive variables also provided for duplicate measures
of sanitation. This database allowed for accurate data on all diar-
rheal illnesses over the course of the children’s lifetime.
Conclusion. SIBO was observed in 2-year-old Bangladeshi
children living under unsanitary conditions and was associated
with malnutrition, poor sanitation, and markers of intestinal in-
flammation. Future study is needed to prospectively determine
whether SIBO itself has a detrimental impact on growth of devel-
oping world children. This should include longitudinal study of
SIBO’s natural history to better understand the burden of this
disease and to identify the environmental exposures that cause
SIBO. Based on this study, these efforts should focus on the role of
environmental contamination’s ability to cause a functional intes-
tinal disorder that may predispose to SIBO and the development
of EE.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Data source and design. We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of 90
2-year-old children from a cohort of 700 children followed since birth in
Dhaka, Bangladesh. All children were previously enrolled in the PRO-
VIDE study, which was a randomized clinical trial with two vaccine inter-
ventions designed to investigate causes of oral vaccine underperformance
in the developing world. The materials and methods of the PROVIDE
study have been described elsewhere (48). The children assessed for SIBO
testing were the final 103 children enrolled in PROVIDE. This study was
approved by the Research and Ethical Review Committees of the Interna-
tional Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh (icddr,b) as
well as the Institutional Review Boards of the University of Vermont and
the University of Virginia.
Population and setting. The study took place in the urban neighbor-
hood of Mirpur in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Mirpur was settled primarily by
FIG 2 Inflammatory markers in small intestine bacterial overgrowth (SIBO)-positive and -negative subjects. (A) Calprotectin is a neutrophil-derived protein
that, when elevated in the stool, indicates intestinal inflammation. The mean fecal calprotectin level in SIBO-positive subjects was 1,834.6 �g/g compared to
766.7 �g/g in SIBO-negative children (P � 0.004). (B) Reg 1� is a proproliferative, antiapoptotic protein secreted by damaged epithelial cells. When elevated in
the stool, it indicates damage to the intestinal epithelium. Children with SIBO had a mean Reg 1� level of 116.8 �g/ml compared to 65.6 �g/ml in SIBO-negative
children (P � 0.02).

 ethnic Bihari after Bangladesh obtained its independence in 1971. The
neighborhood is densely populated, with an average of 5 people living in
1.5 rooms. The average monthly household income is 12,700 taka (ap-
proximately 163 U.S. dollars). Ninety-six percent of construction is tin or
mud brick. Open sewers flow throughout the area and are directly adja-
cent to 59% of homes. Overall, our study participants tended to come
from the lowest socioeconomic strata of the Mirpur community due to
the area in which recruitment occurred and the location of our study
clinic.
Measures. (i) Primary outcome variable. The primary dichotomous
outcome was the presence or absence of SIBO at the 2-year-old study visit.
SIBO was measured via glucose hydrogen breath testing using a QuinTron
BreathTracker SC gas chromatograph (QuinTron Instrument Company,
Inc., Milwaukee, WI). Patients fasted for 3 h prior to the onset of testing.
Children with WAZ score of ��3 SD were not tested due to concern by
the Research and Ethical Review Committees that fasting was unsafe in
this vulnerable group. Children meeting this criteria were referred for
nutritional therapy at the icddr,b nutritional rehabilitation unit. This was
the only additional exclusion criteria added to those used in selection of
the original PROVIDE cohort (48). Children with a WAZ score of � �3
SD were tested at baseline and then given a glucose solution of 100 g
glucose in 500-ml sterile water administered at 5 ml/kg body weight.
Breath was collected via the QuinTron infant bag collection system with
an age-appropriate anesthesia mask attached at 20-min intervals for 3 h.
CO2 was measured to ensure sampling of alveolar gas. Children were
allowed water during the fast and testing but not other food or drink.
Presence of SIBO was defined as an increase of at least 12 ppm in breath
hydrogen over baseline at any measurement within the 3-h test period, in
accordance with expert consensus based on adult patients (49).
(ii) Covariates in logistic regression to predict presence of SIBO at
2 years of age. Covariates were selected to represent competing hypothe-
ses on why children with no underlying gastrointestinal pathology would
develop SIBO from environmental exposure. Income was included as a
socioeconomic marker. The changes in LAZ and WAZ scores from
enrollment to the time of SIBO testing at 2 years of age were included as
markers of overall health and nutrition. The number of diarrheal episodes
from birth to 2 years of age and presence of a diarrheal illness within the
last 30 days were included as SIBO can develop under conditions of de-
layed intestinal motility, and postinfectious gastroparesis or ileus is com-
mon in children. Indicators of environmental fecal contamination in-
cluded a primary drinking water source other than the municipal supply,
the presence of an open drain/sewer directly outside the home, and a
mother who trims her fingernails less than once a month (50). Data on
covariates were collected from the PROVIDE database.
(iii) Intestinal inflammation, intestinal permeability, and systemic
inflammation. To assess intestinal inflammation, both fecal Reg 1� and
fecal calprotectin were measured on the same day as SIBO testing via
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Reg 1� is a proproliferative anti-
apoptotic protein secreted by damaged intestinal epithelial cells. It has
been shown to be elevated in stool in the setting of environmental enter-
opathy and predictive of growth failure in developing world children (51).
Fecal calprotectin is a neutrophil-derived protein also shown to be ele-
vated in states of intestinal inflammation (52, 53). Intestinal permeability
was measured via a L/M ratio as assessed via urinary analysis after inges-
tion of a lactose-mannitol solution. L/M ratio testing was not conducted
on the same day as SIBO testing to prevent interference between separate
carbohydrate substrates used for the two tests but was performed within
7 days of SIBO testing. To assess systemic inflammation, C-reactive pro-
tein and a 17-plex Luminex cytokine panel (granulocyte colony-
stimulating factor [G-CSF], granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating
factor [GM-CSF], gamma interferon [IFN-�], interleukin-1� [IL-1�],
IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12 [p70], IL-13, IL-17, mono-
cyte chemoattractant protein 1 [MCP-1], macrophage inflammatory pro-
tein 1� [MIP-1�], and tumor necrosis factor alpha [TNF-�]) were con-
ducted on plasma obtained on the day of SIBO testing. Cytokines were
dichotomized to �50th percentile (baseline) and �50th percentile of the
tested cohort for this analysis.
Statistical analysis. The primary analysis to determine risk factors for
SIBO development in the developing world was performed using multi-
variable logistic regression with the presence of SIBO at 2 years of age as
the outcome measure. A Hosmer-Lemeshow statistic was produced for
the regression model to ensure stability. A nonsignificant �2 statistic was
generated (P � 0.05), ensuring goodness of fit for our model. The second-
ary analysis of the difference between SIBO-positive and SIBO-negative
children for the measures of inflammation and intestinal permeability was
calculated via either Mann-Whitney U test or Fisher’s exact test, as appro-
priate. Correction for multiple comparisons was conducted via FDR cal-
culation, with an FDR of 30% set for determination of importance. SPSS
Statistics version 22 (IBM, Armonk, NY) and SAS version 9.4 (SAS Insti-
tute, Cary, NC) were used for all statistical analyses.
