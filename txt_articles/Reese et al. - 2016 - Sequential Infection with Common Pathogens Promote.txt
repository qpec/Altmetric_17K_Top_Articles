SUMMARY
Immune responses differ between laboratory mice
and humans. Chronic infection with viruses and par-
asites are common in humans, but are absent in
laboratory mice, and thus represent potential con-
tributors to inter-species differences in immunity.
To test this, we sequentially infected laboratory
mice with herpesviruses, influenza, and an intestinal
helminth and compared their blood immune sig-
natures to mock-infected mice before and after
vaccination against yellow fever virus (YFV-17D).
Sequential infection altered pre- and post-vaccina-
tion gene expression, cytokines, and antibodies in
blood. Sequential pathogen exposure induced gene
signatures that recapitulated those seen in blood
from pet store-raised versus laboratory mice, and
adult versus cord blood in humans. Therefore, basal
and vaccine-induced murine immune responses are
altered by infection with agents common outside of
barrier facilities. This raises the possibility that we
can improve mouse models of vaccination and im-
munity by selective microbial exposure of laboratory
animals to mimic that of humans.
INTRODUCTION
Substantial variation in human immune responses is due to
environmental influences (Brodin et al., 2015; Roederer et al.,
2015). Potential variables include nutritional status, different
health practices, age, socioeconomic status, and geographic
location. In addition, the bacterial microbiome influences im-
mune and inflammatory responses (Honda and Littman, 2012;
Hooper et al., 2012). An added, but less well understood, envi-
ronmental contributor to variation is the history of infection with
acute and chronic pathogens, including herpesviruses and in-
testinal parasites (Foxman and Iwasaki, 2011; Furman et al.,
2015; Salgame et al., 2013; Virgin, 2014; Virgin et al., 2009).
Persistent infections change the immune response to unrelated
pathogens and vaccines (Furman et al., 2015; Oldstone, 2005;
Osborne et al., 2014; Reese et al., 2014; Salgame et al., 2013;
Selin et al., 2006; Slifka et al., 2003; Virgin, 2014). Some chronic
co-infections enhance, while others inhibit, immunity to sec-
ondary challenge (Barton et al., 2007; MacDuff et al., 2015;
Stelekati et al., 2014; Stelekati and Wherry, 2012). Moreover,
humans are frequently infected with acute viral pathogens,
which may change the immune system (Foxman and Iwasaki,
2011).
There is concern that rodent models do not faithfully predict
human immune responses (Mestas and Hughes, 2004; Seok
et al., 2013; Takao and Miyakawa, 2015), limiting the value
of this powerful model system. However, mouse models are
indispensable for biomedical studies and play a significant role
in the development of vaccines and therapeutics. This high-
lights the need for studies that identify environmental vari-
ables that might, in addition to chromosomal genetic variation,
contribute to species-specific immune response differences be-
tween mice and humans. Notably, barrier-raised mice are free
of many acute and chronic infections that are recognized to
contribute to human immune variation (Salgame et al., 2013; Vir-
gin, 2014). For example, people chronically infected with intesti-
nal helminths have lower responses to vaccination with Bacillus
Calmette-Gue
´ rin (BCG) (Elias et al., 2001), cholera (Cooper et al.,
2001) and tetanus toxoid (Nookala et al., 2004; Sabin et al.,
1996). Furthermore, chronic infection with the herpesvirus
cytomegalovirus (HCMV) alters responses to human influenza
vaccination (Furman et al., 2015), and infection of mice with mu-
rine CMV (MCMV) and/or a murine g-herpesvirus (MHV68) alters
bacterial immunity and reverses inherited immunodeficiency
(Barton et al., 2007; MacDuff et al., 2015). We therefore sought
to test the hypothesis that infection history, and in particular

 the presence of chronic co-infections in mice with agents similar
to those commonly acquired by human children as they develop,
alters basal and vaccine-induced immunity. We went on to
assess the relationship of the changes we observed to gene
expression differences between cord blood and adult blood in
humans.
RESULTS
Reduced Antibody Response in Mice Co-infected with
Multiple Viruses and a Helminth after YFV-17D
Vaccination
We separated 159 C57Bl/6 barrier-raised mice into four separate
experiments (Figure S1B). Within each experiment, half of the
mice were sequentially inoculated with PBS (‘‘mock-infected’’)
and half were infected with a series of viruses and a helminth
parasite starting at weaning to mimic a diverse infection history
(‘‘co-infected’’; Figures 1A and S1). An institutional review com-
mittee following federal guidelines approved all experiments. For
co-infections, we chose MHV68 (related to human Epstein-Barr
virus and Kaposi’s sarcoma herpesvirus) and MCMV (related to
human CMV), both of which establish persistent and latent infec-
tions in mice and alter immune responses and/or gene expres-
sion in multiple organs during chronic infection (Barton et al.,
2007; Canny et al., 2014; White et al., 2010). Co-infected mice
were also challenged with influenza strain WSN as a representa-
tive acute respiratory viral challenge, and Heligmosomoides pol-
ygyrus, an intestinal helminth that establishes chronic infection in
the small intestines of mice (Osborne et al., 2014; Reese et al.,
2014). All of these pathogens are models for pathogens that
commonly infect humans starting early in childhood. 5–16 weeks
after the last infection, co-infected and mock-infected mice were
vaccinated with the live attenuated yellow fever vaccine YFV-
17D. Total anti-YFV IgG was measured in serum following vacci-
nation (Figure 1B). Co-infected and control mice exhibited
equivalent antibody responses early after vaccination, but by
day 34 total anti-YFV IgG was lower in co-infected than in
mock mice (Figure 1B). Total neutralizing antibody titers were
similar at this time point, suggesting that co-infection changed
the amount of antibody rather than the quality of the neutralizing
response (Figure 1C). Viral replication of YFV-17D is very low
in mice and is often undetectable in vaccinated mice (Meier
et al., 2009). Using a sensitive RT-PCR assay (Mantel et al.,
2008), we detected no difference in the number of mice with
detectable YFV in the draining lymph node either 3 or 7 days after
vaccination (Figure 1D), suggesting that antibody differences
were not due to a difference in virus replication. Whether the
statistically significant difference we observe in total antibody
to YFV-17D is biologically significant remains to be determined.
Neutralizing antibody is used as a correlate of protection for YFV
(Mason et al., 1973); however, antibodies have other functions in
controlling viruses, and there is evidence that these Fc-mediated
functions not measured by neutralization may have important
roles in virus control (Chung et al., 2015; Pulendran and Ahmed,
2011).
Defining Transcriptional Effects of Co-infections before
and after Vaccination
To define genome-wide transcriptional effects of co-infection on
basal and vaccine-induced immunity, we harvested peripheral
blood from mice prior to (day 0) and 3, 7, or 21 days after
vaccination and examined gene expression by microarray. Un-
supervised analysis revealed significant differences between
mock and co-infected samples, with mock samples clustering
together and co-infected samples clustering separately (Fig-
ure S2). These data indicate that co-infection altered the basal
state of the immune system prior to vaccination as well as
gene expression patterns in blood cells following vaccination.
Consistent with this, fold change scatter plots indicated minimal
overlap in gene expression profiles between co-infected mice
and mock-infected mice after vaccination at days 3 (rho =
0.029), 7 (rho = 0.11), and 21 (rho = 0.06) (Figure S3). We identi-
fied genes differentially expressed between co-infected and
mock mice and performed K-means clustering to associate
groups of genes that changed significantly over time during
YFV infection between mock and co-infected mice. We identified
five temporally distinct groups of genes differentially expressed
between mock and co-infected mice. These genes contained a

 total of 701 genes that fall into a broad range of biological func-
tions related to immunity, organelle function, protein catabolism,
cell death, metabolism, hemostasis, and other processes (Fig-
ures 2A and 2B).
Pathway Analysis of Five Gene Clusters in Mock and Co-
infected Mice
Clusters 1 and 2 contain genes that were relatively similar in
expression in co-infected and mock mice prior to vaccination
and were more increased in response to vaccination in mock
than in co-infected mice, especially 7 and 21 days after vaccina-
tion (Figures 2A and 2B). Pathway analysis revealed that cluster 1
genes are involved in ubiquitination, cell cycle, NF-kB signaling,
and innate immune response signaling (Figure 2C, Table S1).
Cluster 2 includes a smaller set of genes with a similar kinetic
pattern that are related to Golgi vesicle transport. Thus, co-infec-
tion can substantially blunt transcriptional responses corre-
sponding to these processes in barrier-raised mice.
Cluster 3 and 4 genes were elevated in co-infected mice prior
to vaccination and were further induced by vaccination of
co-infected mice at day 3 and then diminished with varying ki-
netics by days 7 and 21 (Figures 2A and 2B). These genes repre-
sent a set of processes that are induced by co-infection but less
substantially upregulated by vaccination of mock mice. This
suggests that co-infection markedly changed the basal state of
the immune system and enhanced certain vaccine-induced tran-
scriptional changes. Cluster 3 genes are involved in the response
to interferon-g (IFNg) and IFNab, regulation of interleukin-1b
(IL-1b) production, T cell activation, and cell death (Figure 2C,
Table S1). These pathways are consistent with analysis of serum
cytokine data, where elevated IFNg and, to a lesser extent,
IL-12p70 and IL-1b were detected in co-infected mice at day
0 prior to vaccination (Figure 2D). Cluster 4 genes are involved
in amine metabolism, symbiotic interactions, and negative regu-
lation of protein modifications (Figure 2C, Table S1).
Cluster 5 genes were lower prior to vaccination in co-infected
mice and followed a kinetic pattern most similar to cluster 1
genes, with the exception that these genes were induced by
vaccination in mock mice earlier than observed for cluster 1
genes, peaking at day 3. These genes are involved in IL-12
production and the function of non-lymphoid blood cells such
as basophils and phagocytes as well as platelets (Figure 2C,
Table S1).
Leading Edge Metagene Analysis and Comparison of
Metagenes with Pet Store versus Laboratory Mice
Together, these data indicate that a history of infection in barrier-
raised mice with agents similar to those that commonly infect hu-
mans changes both the basal state of the immune system and
the nature and the kinetics of vaccine responses. We next sought
to determine how the sets of genes regulated by co-infection
related to gene expression patterns observed in other biologi-
cally relevant settings. We first considered that co-infection of
barrier-raised laboratory mice might induce gene expression
patterns similar to those observed in mice raised in non-barrier
conditions. To this end, we performed Leading Edge Metagene
(LEM) analysis (Godec et al., 2016), comparing co-infected
and mock at baseline, to identify sets of genes with correlated
expression (metagenes) representing specific biological pro-
cesses within the co-infection gene expression profile in our
datasets. This analysis identified a type I interferon response-en-
riched metagene in co-infected mice and a naive lymphocyte-
enriched metagene in mock-infected mice (Figure S4, Table
S2). The significant enrichment of genes in co-infected mice in
multiple pathways related to interferon signaling and innate
immune responses is consistent with prior observations of the
effects of latent and persistent herpesvirus infection on IFNg
expression (Barton et al., 2007; MacDuff et al., 2015).
We next performed enrichment analysis of the co-infected
day 0 versus mock day 0 type I interferon response metagene
with gene expression observed in pet store mice compared to
barrier-raised laboratory mice. In addition, we compared these
metagenes to laboratory mice co-housed with pet store mice
compared to barrier-raised laboratory mice (Beura et. al, 2016)
(Figures 3A and 3B). The type I interferon metagene found in
co-infected mice was significantly enriched in pet store mice
as well as laboratory mice co-housed with pet store mice, while
the naive lymphocyte metagene found in mock mice was signif-
icantly enriched in laboratory mice (Figure 3). Thus, co-infected
mice express genes found in mice raised in a more ‘‘dirty’’ envi-
ronment compared to a specific pathogen-free barrier.
Comparison of Metagenes in Mock and Co-infected
Mice with Neonate and Adult Blood Gene Expression
Signatures
To understand whether these observations relate to species-
specific gene expression patterns differing between barrier-
raised mice and adult humans, we compared gene expression
profiles prior to vaccination in mock and co-infected mice with
human cord blood and adult blood (Votavova et al., 2011). We
found that the type I interferon metagene identified in co-
infected mice was significantly enriched in maternal human
blood, while the naive lymphocyte metagene in mock mice
was significantly enriched in human cord blood (Figure 4).
Taken together, these data suggest that mock mice from a bar-
rier facility have a naive or immature immune system that is
more similar to human neonates than human adults. Co-infec-
tion of these barrier-raised mice promotes an immune system
gene expression pattern more similar to pet store-raised mice
and adult humans.
DISCUSSION
These data indicate that studies of immune responses in mice
should consider the virome, helminth infection, and, more
broadly, infection history as potential determinants of species-
specific immune responses. Chromosomal genes that differ be-
tween mice and humans do not solely determine inter-species
differences in the immune system. Environmental factors that
contribute to variation in immune response include nutritional
status, age, socioeconomic status, geographic location, and
the microbiome. While studies of the bacterial microbiome high-
light the important contribution this variable makes to inflamma-
tory responses (Honda and Littman, 2012; Hooper et al., 2012),
there are fewer studies addressing the contribution of acute
and chronic viruses and parasites to varying immune responses.
Recent work showed that an acute infection compromised
tissue-specific immunity even after clearance of the bacteria

 (Fonseca et al., 2015). Our work identifies chronic pathogens as
important contributors to differences in response to vaccines,
and likely other inflammatory conditions.
Potential mechanisms for how co-infections alter immunity
are complex. Possible mechanisms include chronic stimulation
of innate immune responses that regulate adaptive immunity,

 antigenic mimicry, cross-reactive immune responses, altered
antigen presentation, and changes in differentiation of memory
and naive lymphocyte responses (Hensley et al., 2007; Oldstone,
2005; Selin et al., 2006; Stelekati et al., 2014; Stelekati and
Wherry, 2012; Virgin, 2014; Virgin et al., 2009). Latent infection
with the g-herpesvirus used in our studies, MHV68, alters the
number and phenotype of memory CD8+ T cells (Barton et al.,
2014). Latent MCMV infection also results in profound alteration
in the T cell compartment, leading to impaired naive T cell func-
tion (Cicin-Sain et al., 2012), despite no increase in susceptibility
to secondary challenge with influenza virus, West Nile virus, or
vesicular stomatitis (Marandu et al., 2015). Any or all of these
mechanisms could be important contributors to co-infection-
associated changes in gene expression and altered antibody
responses to YFV vaccination.
It is important to note that effects of co-infections and mech-
anisms that drive co-infection-mediated changes in immune
responses will likely differ depending on the co-infecting path-
ogens. Some pathogens will have more profound effects on
T cells, for example, whereas others will have stronger effects
on other aspects of immunity. Moreover, the effects driven by
co-infections could be different for different vaccines. Some
vaccine responses may be more affected by co-infections than
others. More detailed studies will be required to determine which
or what combination of our co-infecting pathogens are required
for the effects we are seeing. Additionally, other studies exam-
ining different co-infecting pathogens and vaccines will be
required to delineate mechanisms.
YFV vaccine is extremely efficacious; however, immune re-
sponses in humans differ significantly. Evidence suggests that
although vaccine provides protection in greater than 80% of vac-
cinees, levels of neutralizing antibody and T cell responses are
significantly different (Querec et al., 2009). Additionally, B and
T cell responses to YFV vaccination are measurably different in
people from different parts of the world with variable levels of
baseline immune activation prior to vaccination (Gaucher et al.,
2008; Muyanja et al., 2014). Together, these data suggest that

environmental factors, including possible
co-infections, may contribute to inter-indi-
vidual variation.
In order to enhance reproducibility of
mouse studies, the biomedical research
community rendered this important research
animal specific-pathogen free. In doing so,
researchers may have created an immune response that is less
relevant to studies of humans or other mammals raised outside
of barrier containment. Careful consideration of these issues
may enhance the value of mouse models for experimental
research relevant to human disease. As mechanisms for effects
such as the co-infection-dependent changes in immunity identi-
fied here are defined, we speculate that it may become possible
to manipulate the nature of mouse immune responses by re-intro-
ducing, under controlled circumstances, some of the natural in-
fectious exposures that constitute the selective pressures that
shaped the mouse immune system. This may partially humanize
murine immune responses.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Animals, Infections, and Sample Collection
The individual experiments are outlined in Figure S1. In summary, at weaning,
mice were divided into two groups. The mock group was housed in the
biohazard facility with the co-infected group. The co-infected mice were
infected with 105 plaque forming units (PFU) of MHV68 intranasally, followed
by 105 PFU (in PBS) tissue culture passage MCMV intraperitoneally, 103 PFU
influenza strain WSN (in PBS) intranasally, and 50 L3 larvae of H. polygyrus
orally. Mice were then rested in the biohazard facility for 5–12 weeks. Mock
and co-infected mice were challenged with 106 PFU of YFV-17D subcutane-
ously in the footpad. Mice were sacrificed on days 0, 3, 7, and 21, and on
days 34–40 for experiments1, 2, and 4. Blood cells, serum, spleen, and draining
lymph node were collected. Blood cells were processed using RiboPure RNA
purification kit from whole blood (Thermo Fisher Scientific). RNA from individual
mice from each time point was pooled within an experiment for microarrays.
Samples were hybridized to Affymetrix Mouse 430 2.0 arrays.
Analysis of Microarray Data
Prior to analysis, mouse microarray data were processed and normalized using
the Affymetrix MAS5 algorithm, and batch correction was performed using
the ComBat algorithm. Genes exhibiting differential kinetics between co-in-
fected and mock samples over the d0–d21 time course were identified using
maSigPro (Conesa et al., 2006) (default FDR < 0.05). Gene set enrichment anal-
ysis (GSEA) was performed as described previously (Subramanian et al., 2005).
LEM analysis was performed downstream of GSEA to yield groups of genes,
termed metagenes, which are coordinately upregulated in a given phenotypic
comparison and common to multiple enriched gene sets. Metagenes were

 identified for d0 co-infected relative to d0 mock and vice versa. Enrichments of
co-infected and mock metagenes in pet store versus laboratory mouse (GEO:
GSE78979), cohoused versus laboratory mouse (GEO: GSE78979) (Beura et.
al, 2016), and adult PBMC versus cord PBMC array data (GEO: GSE27272)
(Votavova et al., 2011) were determined using standard GSEA.
