 Prostate Cancer Grading
A Decade After the 2005 Modified Gleason Grading System
Oleksandr N. Kryvenko, MD; Jonathan I. Epstein, MD
� Since 1966, when Donald Gleason, MD, first proposed
grading prostate cancer based on its histologic architec-
ture, there have been numerous changes in clinical and
pathologic practices relating to prostate cancer. Patterns 1
and 2, comprising more than 30% of cases in the original
publications by Gleason, are no longer reported on biopsy
and are rarely diagnosed on radical prostatectomy. Many
of these cases may even have been mimickers of prostate
cancer that were described later with the use of
contemporary immunohistochemistry. The original Glea-
son system predated many newly described variants of
prostate cancer and our current concept of intraductal
carcinoma. Gleason also did not describe how to report
prostate cancer on biopsy with multiple cores of cancer or
on radical prostatectomy with separate tumor nodules. To
address these issues, the International Society of Urolog-
ical Pathology first made revisions to the grading system in
2005, and subsequently in 2014. Additionally, a new
grading system composed of Grade Groups 1 to 5 that was
first developed in 2013 at the Johns Hopkins Hospital and
subsequently validated in a large multi-institutional and
multimodal study was presented at the 2014 International
Society of Urological Pathology meeting and accepted
both by participating pathologists as well as urologists,
oncologists, and radiation therapists. In the present study,
we describe updates to the grading of prostate cancer
along with the new grading system.

he first publications on prostate cancer appeared in the
first decade of the 20th century and were by Hugh
Hampton Young, MD, a urologist from The Johns Hopkins
Hospital and a founder of the Journal of Urology in 1917, who
developed the technique of perineal prostatectomy more
than a hundred years ago.1 In 1909, Young described his
experience with 111 patients with prostate cancer and
acknowledged the contribution of pathologist John T.
Geraghty, MD, who described pathologic findings in 9
autopsies, 6 radical prostatectomies (RPs), and 24 partial
prostatectomies.2 The author noted that ‘‘the histologic
character of cancer of the prostate is very variable’’ and
described acinar, scirrhous, and solid patterns of growth.
Interestingly, intraductal spread of carcinoma was also
noted. Subsequent reports on prostate cancer mostly
followed Broders’ approach of grading carcinomas based
on ‘‘the percentage of undifferentiated cells.’’3,4
In 1966, Donald Gleason, MD, developed the classifica-
tion of prostatic carcinomas on material from a group of
Veterans Administration Hospitals. In a major departure
from prior classifications, Gleason used prostate cancer
histologic architectural pattern, rather than cytology, for
assigning the grade. The classification was developed using
biopsies,
transurethral
resections,
and
RPs
from
270
patients.5 Because most of the specimens showed more
than one pattern of carcinoma, it was suggested to assign
two patterns to each case in the order of dominance. This
grading system was subsequently tested to predict prostate
cancer–related mortality in 1032 patients.6 Since then, the
system has received a worldwide acceptance and is referred
to as the Gleason grading system.7
RATIONALE FOR MODIFICATION OF THE GLEASON
SYSTEM
The underlying principles of the Gleason grading system
and its contributions to prostate cancer clinical management
retain relevance and influence more than half a century from
the time of its development. However, a number of new
pathologic and clinical discoveries, changes in prostate
cancer screening and detection, and development of new
clinical and pathologic methodologies justify the need for
revising the original grading system.
The original works by Gleason were performed on
morphology alone without immunohistochemistry. It is
very likely that some of the originally described patterns 1
and 2 that constituted a third of cancer in Gleason’s 1974
publication were actually more recently described mimickers
of carcinoma, such as adenosis or partial atrophy.6,8 Gleason
recommended reporting the primary (most common) and
secondary (second most common) patterns, whereas a
minor component of higher-grade cancer, if present, was
not mentioned in the report. Consequently, the issues of

 tertiary patterns of higher grade on RPs and biopsies were
not dealt with. Gleason did not provide recommendations
on reporting multiple cores involved by cancer from
different sites or reporting different tumor nodules of
different grade in RPs. Whereas in Gleason’s era only a
few large-gauge needles were directed into palpable tumors,
with discovery of prostate-specific antigen testing, contem-
porary practice typically samples at least 12 cores, with 1, 2,
or 3 cores per container.9 Finally, some new patterns of
prostatic carcinoma have been described in more recent
times that needed incorporation into the Gleason grading
system.10–16
To address the above needs, two consensus conferences
were held by the International Society of Urological
Pathology (ISUP). Only pathology experts were involved
in the 2005 ISUP conference. In the 2014 consensus
conference, in addition to 67 pathology experts from 17
countries,
there
were
17
urologists,
oncologists,
and
radiation oncologists who met to resolve both matters that
were unresolved from the 2005 meeting as well as new
grading issues that arose in the interim 10 years. The key
findings from these two conferences are described below.
GLEASON PATTERNS 1 TO 5
Gleason Patterns 1 to 2
In 2000, one of the current authors (J.I.E.) wrote an
editorial entitled, ‘‘Gleason score 2-4 adenocarcinoma of the
prostate on needle biopsy: a diagnosis that should not be
made.’’17 This recommendation was based on: (1) poor
reproducibility even among experts; (2) poor correlation
with RP grade, with almost all cases showing higher grade
at resection; and (3) that a diagnosis of Gleason score 2 to 4
may misguide clinicians and patients into believing that the
patient has an indolent tumor. The 2005 consensus
conference softened this proposal, recommending that
‘‘rather than stating categorically that a Gleason score 4
on needle biopsy should never be made, this diagnosis
should be made rarely, if ever.’’7 The 2014 conference
removed the caveat and agreed with the 2000 editorial.8
Gleason Pattern 3
A major point of divergence from the original Gleason
system is with the assignment of grade to cribriform glands.
Within Gleason’s original illustrations of his cribriform
pattern 3, he depicts large cribriform glands.18 Cases graded
prior to 2005 as Gleason pattern 3 included large cribriform
glands that today would uniformly be called Gleason
pattern 4.19,20 It was agreed in the 2005 consensus that the
vast majority of cribriform patterns be diagnosed as Gleason
pattern 4, with only rare cribriform lesions satisfying
diagnostic criteria for cribriform pattern 3.7 However, at
the 2005 conference, when various images of these rare
candidates for cribriform Gleason pattern 3 were shown to
the participants of the consensus meeting, almost none of
them were uniformly accepted as cribriform pattern 3 based
on subtle features. A subsequent study, led by one of the
current authors and published in 2008, found that even in a
highly selected set of images thought to be the best
candidates for cribriform pattern 3, most experts interpreted
the cribriform patterns as pattern 4.21 The authors of this
study concluded that all cribriform structures should be
interpreted as Gleason pattern 4 and not pattern 3.22 This
was formally accepted in the 2014 consensus conference,
based both on the poor interobserver reproducibility of
experts in diagnosing cribriform Gleason pattern 3 cancer
and subsequent numerous studies demonstrating that
cribriform glands, regardless of morphology, were associat-
ed with an adverse prognosis.8,20,23,24
The glomeruloid pattern of prostate cancer has a very
typical morphology of a cribriform structure protruding
inside a dilated cancer gland and only focally being attached
to it, creating an architectural resemblance of a kidney
glomerulus (Figure 1, A). Gleason did not describe the
grading approach to glomeruloid structures. However, in his
work from 1966 there are clear-cut glomeruloid structures in
a pattern that he described as pattern 2 (Figure 1, B, in
Gleason5). The grading of glomeruloid glands was contro-
versial and unresolved in the 2005 consensus conference. In
a subsequent 2009 work by Lotan and Epstein,11 only a
minor percentage of cancers with glomeruloid patterns were
associated with Gleason pattern 3, and it was suggested that
Gleason pattern 4 be assigned to glomeruloid structures. We
confirmed this approach, demonstrating that cases with
glomeruloid structures and otherwise Gleason pattern 3
disease were capable of regional lymph node metastases
and should be assigned Gleason pattern 4.20 In two recent
studies it was shown that glomeruloid structures should be
considered as an early stage of cribriform Gleason pattern
4.23,24 In the 2014 consensus meeting, there was uniform
agreement to consider glomeruloid structures as Gleason
pattern 4.8
The original Gleason pattern 4 consisted almost entirely of
cribriform patterns with a minor component of fused glands.
Ill-defined glands with poorly formed glandular lumina
were not discussed or depicted by Gleason in either Gleason
pattern 3 or 4. It was the consensus of the 2005 conference
that poorly formed glands should not be considered
Gleason pattern 3. Consequently, only individual, well-
formed glands were allowed for Gleason pattern 3.7
Gleason Pattern 4
As described above, based on the 2005 and 2014
conferences, Gleason pattern 4 now consists of either: (1)
cribriform glands (including the glomeruloid pattern); (2)
poorly formed glands; and (3) fused glands. Gleason’s
description of a hypernephromatoid pattern 4 was not clear
and is no longer recommended to be used. Occasional
seemingly poorly formed or fused glands between well-
formed glands are insufficient for a diagnosis of Gleason
pattern 4 because they could represent tangential sections of
adjacent well-formed glands.25 In order to avoid overdiag-
nosing Gleason pattern 4 in this setting, the cluster of poorly
formed glands should be seen at magnification 310. If a
focus of cancer is borderline between Gleason patterns 3
and 4, one should assess the focus on levels, and if still
borderline then should assign Gleason pattern 3.26
Gleason Pattern 5
Gleason pattern 5 remains essentially the same as
Gleason’s original scheme. Gleason pattern 5 is composed
of: (1) solid nests, (2) cords of cells, (3) individual cells, or (4)
nests or cribriform glands with unequivocal necrosis. The
one clarification made in the 2014 conference was that solid
medium to large nests with rosettelike spaces, where the
attempt at glandular differentiation was too poor, should be
graded as Gleason pattern 5. Gleason pattern 5 is frequently
underdiagnosed on prostate needle biopsy.27
One of us (J.I.E.) has demonstrated that in approximately
50% to 60% of cases submitted in consultation at the

 request of patients or clinicians, pattern 5 was underdiag-
nosed.27,28 Pattern 5 is more commonly missed when it is
not the primary pattern, and the solid-sheet pattern was
most readily identified correctly as Gleason pattern 5.28 A
recent study assessed the interobserver variability on the
interpretation of limited amount of pattern 5 in biopsy
specimens between 16 urologic pathologists.29 Although
large collections of single cells or clusters achieved
consensus of Gleason pattern 5, small nests and single
cells/cords of 5 or fewer cells achieved consensus against
pattern 5. Most of the experts considered diagnosing pattern
5 only when present on more than 1 level. Although in most
of the biopsy cases pattern 5 will be associated with pattern
4, in a minor proportion of biopsies pattern 5 may be the
primary or secondary grade in otherwise Gleason pattern 3
disease (Figure 1, B). In a recent study describing 462 men
with Gleason score 8 cancer on biopsy, 421 (91.1%) had
Gleason score 4 þ 4 ¼ 8, and only 41 (8.9%) had a
combination of patterns 3 and 5.30
Two reports suggest that Gleason score 8 cases with
pattern 5 differ in prognosis from those with 4 þ 4 ¼ 8
disease.30,31 One of these studies included patients from
1998 to 2012 who underwent radiation and/or androgen
deprivation therapy and concluded that prostate cancer–
specific mortality was higher when any percent of pattern 5
was present compared with Gleason score 4 þ 4 ¼ 8
disease.30 No comparison was performed between the
outcomes of Gleason score 3 þ 5 ¼ 8 and 5 þ 3 ¼ 8, and
cases from before the 2005 ISUP conference would have
been graded significantly differently from current practice.
Another study extracted data from the Surveillance,
Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database and
concluded that prostate cancer–specific mortality was
similar for Gleason score 4 þ 4 ¼ 8 and 3 þ 5 ¼ 8 prostate
cancer, and the prognosis of patients with Gleason score 5
þ 3 ¼ 8 was more similar to those with Gleason score 9
disease.31 Although SEER provides a large database for
retrospective prostate cancer research, it is not controlled
for the consistency of reporting/grading, and the data are
extracted from pathology reports in hospitals without
central re-review of the slides, with most institutions
lacking genitourinary pathology experts. One potential
error is to grade the overall tumor as 5 þ 3 ¼ 8 in an RP if
there are separate nodules of 5 þ 5 ¼ 10 and 3 þ 3 ¼ 6.
Similarly, a case may have been incorrectly issued a grade
of 5 þ 3 ¼ 8 on needle biopsy if there were separate cores
with 5 þ5 ¼10 and 3 þ3 ¼6. In both of these scenarios, the
cases should be graded as 5 þ 5 ¼ 10 so that it would be
expected that their prognosis would be worse than
Gleason score 8. In a large multi-institutional study with
genitourinary pathology experts from 2005–2014, of 20 845
RP specimens, there were 39 cases (0.2%) with 3 þ 5 ¼ 8
and 4 (0.02%) with 5 þ 3 ¼ 8 (J.I.E., unpublished data).32
Similarly, of 16 172 needle biopsy cases, there were only 44
(0.3%) with 3 þ 5 ¼ 8 and 6 (0.04%) with 5 þ 3 ¼ 8 (J.I.E.,
unpublished data). These data indicate that Gleason score
5 þ 3 ¼ 8 cancer on needle biopsy or RP almost never
occurs in clinical practice.
VARIANTS OF PROSTATE CANCER
The overall rule in grading variants of prostate cancer is to
grade the underlying pattern in a fashion analogous to that
of usual prostate adenocarcinoma. Individual, well-formed
glands are Gleason pattern 3, cribriform/poorly formed/
fused glands are Gleason pattern 4, and lack of gland
formation and necrosis are Gleason pattern 5. In cases with
mixed usual prostatic adenocarcinoma and variant mor-
phology, both the usual acinar prostate carcinoma and
variants are graded. The only exception to this rule is small
cell carcinoma that is not assigned a grade.
Small Cell Carcinoma
Small cell carcinoma of the prostate is an aggressive high-
grade neuroendocrine carcinoma with the diagnostic
features similar to those described in pulmonary small cell
carcinoma (Figure 1, C).33 Despite the lack of gland
formation similar to Gleason pattern 5, small cell carcinoma
has a unique morphology, and more importantly has a
worse prognosis with different treatment than poorly
differentiated prostatic adenocarcinoma.34 Consequently,
small cell carcinoma should be diagnosed without assigning
a Gleason grade. However, many cases are a mixture of
high-grade acinar carcinoma and small cell carcinoma.34,35
In such cases, the prostatic adenocarcinoma component
should be given a Gleason score, although the small cell
carcinoma component is still not graded.
Mucinous Prostatic Adenocarcinoma
This variant is diagnosed in the presence of extraglandular
mucin. In RP specimens, a designation of mucinous
adenocarcinoma should be rendered when more than 25%
of tumor nodule is represented by mucinous carcino-
ma.12,23,36 In biopsy specimens, the term ‘‘adenocarcinoma
with mucinous features’’ should be used. In the 2005 ISUP
consensus meeting there was no agreement regarding the
grading of mucinous prostatic adenocarcinoma (Figure 1,
D). This is in part related to conflicting evidence in limited
prior publications.12,37,38 In 2006, Lane et al36 assessed 12
cases of mucinous prostatic adenocarcinoma and concluded
that this type of prostate cancer did not impart an aggressive
clinical behavior. In a subsequent study of 47 cases of
mucinous adenocarcinoma at RP, only 1 patient had
regional lymph node metastases and 1 patient progressed
3 years after RP.39 Finally, in a recent work by the current
authors, we conducted a case-control study of 184 cases of
Gleason score 7 (both 3 þ 4 and 4 þ 3) at RP and
demonstrated that cancers with regional lymph node
metastases were less likely to be mucinous (1.1%) than
those without (6.5%).23 Thus, in 2014 an agreement was
reached that mucinous adenocarcinoma should be graded
based on the underlying pattern as if extraglandular mucin
were not present.8
Adenocarcinoma With Signet Ring Cell–like Features
This pattern is usually seen in high-grade cancers (Figure
1, E). It differs from true signet ring cells, seen, for example,
in gastric carcinomas, in that the intracytoplasmic vacuole in
prostate cancer is clear and does not contain mucin (Figure
1, F).40 Although older works, including original publica-
tions by Gleason, suggested assigning pattern 5 to cancers
with signet ring cell–like pattern,5,41 it is now recognized
that such findings can be seen in lower-grade prostate
cancer (Figure 2, A), and even high-grade prostatic
intraepithelial neoplasia and intraductal prostatic carcino-
ma.42 The consensus is that the intracytoplasmic vacuoles
should not influence the grade, and, akin to mucinous
carcinoma, the grade should be assigned based on the
underlying architectural pattern as if the intracytoplasmic
vacuoles were not present.7

 Prostatic Duct (Ductal) Adenocarcinoma
Prostatic duct adenocarcinoma is distinctive, with its tall,
pseudostratified columnar cells, as opposed to the simple
cuboidal or short columnar cytology seen in usual acinar
prostate adenocarcinoma (Figure 2, B).16 It is infrequent in
its pure form and is often seen in specimens composed of a
mixture of usual acinar and prostatic duct adenocarcinoma.
In some cases prostatic duct adenocarcinoma can be seen
within ducts retaining a patchy basal cell layer.43
Most prostatic duct adenocarcinomas have a cribriform
pattern and are graded as Gleason pattern 4.7 A relatively
unique morphology seen in ductal adenocarcinoma is
papillary architecture with true fibrovascular cores, typically
mixed with cribriform glands, that is also graded as pattern
4. If necrosis is present, then Gleason pattern 5 is assigned.
Gleason pattern 3 is given to the more recently described
‘‘prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia-like ductal adenocarci-
noma,’’ composed of discrete, often dilated individual
glands lined by pseudostratified columnar cells lacking
basal cells (Figure 2, C).44
Basal Cell Carcinoma
Basal cell carcinoma of the prostate has a broad spectrum
of patterns, including individual glands resembling basal cell
hyperplasia; medium-sized nests, some with central tubule
formation; large nests with necrosis; and cribriform glands,
which can in some cases resemble adenoid cystic carcinoma
seen in the salivary gland. The presence of solid patterns
with necrosis and high Ki-67 nuclear labeling index may
distinguish more aggressive variants. However, many basal
cell carcinomas have a cribriform pattern associated with a
relatively indolent clinical course characterized by local
infiltration as opposed to distant metastases (Figure 2, D).45
Consequently, the Gleason system does not apply to basal
cell carcinomas, although a comment should be made on
the expected behavior based on the morphology (ie,
presence or absence of large, solid nests with necrosis).
VARIANT HISTOLOGY OF USUAL (ACINAR) PROSTATIC
ADENOCARCIOMA
Mucinous Fibroplasia
Mucinous fibroplasia (also known as collagenous micro-
nodules) is an ingrowth of paler-appearing connective tissue
often associated with intraluminal mucin, leading to
distortion of the gland mimicking a higher-grade pattern
(Figure 2, E and F).7 The grading of mucinous fibroplasia
was not revisited in 2014 and the agreement was retained
from 2005 to mentally subtract the mucinous fibroplasia and
grade the underlying morphology. It may be difficult to
determine whether glands are truly fused or merely
connected to other glands as a result of the fibroplasia, so
that diagnosing Gleason pattern 4 in the setting of
mucinous fibroplasia should only be made if unequivocal
cribriform glands are present.
Foamy Gland Carcinoma
Initial descriptions of this variant were individual glands
of carcinoma containing abundant xanthomatous-appearing
cytoplasm and were graded as Gleason pattern 3 (Figure 3,
A).46 Subsequently, prostate carcinomas with foamy cyto-
plasm with Gleason patterns 4 and 5 architecture have been
reported.47 Foamy gland cancer should be graded based on
underlying morphology, and this subtype by itself does not
affect the prognosis.
Paneth Cell–like Neuroendocrine Differentiation
The term Paneth cell–like change has been used to describe
distinctive eosinophilic neuroendocrine cells that can be
seen in benign prostate glands, high-grade prostatic
intraepithelial neoplasia, intraductal carcinoma, and usual
acinar adenocarcinoma of the prostate (Figure 3, B).33 In
some cases the tumor cells do not have prominent pink
granules and appear as small, poorly formed glands or
ribbons of cells with distinctive deeply amphophilic
cytoplasm and bland cytology.14,15 These Paneth cell–like
foci may be present in well-formed glands of Gleason
pattern 3 but also can be present in cords or ribbons of cells
with bland cytology, where, if strictly applying the Gleason
grading system, one would assign a Gleason pattern 5.
However, it can be questioned whether these cords/ribbons
should be graded as pattern 5 because of their bland
cytology, typically limited nature, and frequent association
with lower-grade acinar adenocarcinoma. We do not assign
a Gleason score to neuroendocrine cancers composed of
cords/ribbons of cells but comment as to their generally
favorable prognosis based on the limited data available.
However, there have been anecdotal cases where such a
tumor progressed to metastatic disease with small cell
carcinoma.
Treated Prostatic Adenocarcinoma
Adenocarcinoma with radiation effect typically manifests
as individual cells with abundant vacuolated cytoplasm and
pyknotic nuclei without prominent nucleoli (Figure 3, C).
Cancers that show radiation therapy effect have been
associated with a better prognosis than tumors that appear
unaltered by radiation.48 A Gleason grade should not be
assigned, because of artifactual therapy-related changes in
the morphology that mimic higher-grade cancer. Similarly,
cancers with hormone therapy effect appear higher grade
and should not be assigned a Gleason score. If a specimen
from a patient with a history of radiation or hormonal
therapy shows cancer not altered by the therapy, the
comment should be made that carcinoma lacks treatment
effect and the appropriate Gleason grade should be
assigned.
Pseudohyperplastic Prostatic Adenocarcinoma
This variant consists of large glands with branching and
papillary infolding, architecturally resembling benign glands
that can also be present in areas of perineural invasion
(Figure 3, D).49,50 Based on its underlying pattern, pseudo-
hyperplastic cancer is graded as Gleason score 3 þ 3 ¼ 6.
Intraductal Carcinoma of the Prostate
Contemporary literature often attributes the original
description of intraductal carcinoma of the prostate (IDC-
P) to Kovi et al51 (1985) and McNeal and Yemoto19 (1996),
who noted its association with higher-grade cancer and
interpreted it as a secondary spread inside the ducts rather
than a precursor lesion. However, as early as 1909, Dr
Geraghty, a pathologist working with Hugh Hampton
Young at The Johns Hopkins Hospital, stated: ‘‘Cancer of
the prostate spreads in two ways, by direct extension
through the stroma and by extension along the ducts. As a
result of this duct extension one sometimes sees masses of
cancer cells filling the acini, the intervening tissue being

 entirely normal.’’2 The most commonly used contempo-
rary definition of IDC-P is by Guo and Epstein,52
requiring an intraductal growth with either: (1) solid
pattern; (2) dense cribriform morphology, defined as
greater than 70% epithelium as opposed to lumens; or (3)
loose cribriform and/or micropapillary lesions with either
marked nuclear atypia (63 normal) or comedonecrosis
(Figure 3, E and F). The above criteria of IDC-P were
derived based on architectural patterns or cytologic
features that clearly exceed those of high-grade prostatic
intraepithelial neoplasia.
Most cases of IDC-P reflect adjacent high-grade carcino-
ma involving ducts and acini in a retrograde fashion, which
has been termed by some as ‘‘regular IDC-P.’’53 In contrast,
‘‘precursor IDC-P’’ is found without a nearby invasive
component, representing a de novo intraepithelial lesion as
opposed to retrograde extension by invasive carcinoma.
Regular IDC-P (ie, associated with invasive carcinoma) is
associated with higher grade and stage cancer and an
increased risk of progression following treatment compared
with precursor IDC-P.53 We have previously shown that
among Gleason score 7 cancers with lymph node metasta-
ses, the incidence of IDC-P is twice as common compared
with cases without metastatic disease.23 In a study by
Robinson and Epstein,54 the authors reported RP findings
from 66 men with IDC-P on biopsy without invasive cancer.
Most men had advanced-stage disease, pT3a or higher, and
the median Gleason score was 8. In only 2 men was there
precursor IDC-P as the sole finding in RP. In other studies
the presence of IDC-P on biopsy was demonstrated as an
independent factor in multivariate analysis predicting
biochemical recurrence in men treated by radiation and
RP.23,55,56
In support of grading IDC-P is that when seen on biopsy
without invasive carcinoma, Gleason score 7 or higher will
be present in 90% of corresponding RP specimens. When
IDC-P is associated with invasive cancer on biopsy, the
invasive cancer is almost always Gleason score of 7 or
higher. However, precursor IDC-P without infiltrating
carcinoma or only seen with Gleason score 3 þ 3 ¼ 6 cancer
can be seen at RP.57 In these cases, had a Gleason score
been assigned to the cribriform or solid IDC-P it would have
labeled the patient as having a poor prognosis when in fact
the prognosis was excellent. A total of 82% of ISUP 2014
consensus participants voted that IDC-P should not have a
grade assigned and its presence should be documented
separately in the reporting.8 A comment should be made
describing its common association with high-grade prostate
cancer. Intraductal carcinoma of the prostate should be
included in the percentage of core involved by cancer.
A NEW CONTEMPORARY PROSTATE CANCER
GRADING SYSTEM
Problems With the Current Gleason System
First, Gleason scores 2 to 5 are currently no longer
assigned and certain patterns that Gleason defined as a
score of 6 are now graded as 7, thus leading to
contemporary Gleason score 6 cancers having a better
prognosis than historic score 6 cancers.
Second, in practice, the lowest score now assigned is 6,
although it is on a scale of 2 to 10. This leads to a logical yet
incorrect assumption on the part of patients that the cancer
on biopsy is in the middle of the grade scale, compounding
the fear of a cancer diagnosis, thus leading to an expectation
that definite treatment is always necessary.
Third, combining Gleason scores into a 3-tier grouping (6,
7, 8–10) is used most frequently for prognostic and
therapeutic purposes, despite 3 þ 4 ¼ 7 versus 4 þ 3 ¼ 7
and 8 versus 9 to 10 having very different prognoses.8
Development of a New Grading System
As a result of the first two problems noted above, it has
been questioned whether Gleason score 3 þ 3 ¼ 6 should
retain the designation of cancer or be relabeled as indolent
lesion of epithelial origin to avoid fear and consequential
overtreatment of a proportion of potentially indolent
prostate cancers.58 This is also based on the observations
from the two studies showing that using a contemporary
grading approach, pure Gleason score 3 þ 3 ¼ 6 at RP is
incapable of regional lymph node metastasis.20,59 At RP,
pure Gleason score 3 þ 3 ¼ 6, organ-confined, margin-
negative disease has an excellent prognosis, with only
occasional men demonstrating detectable prostate-specific
antigen that may be in part due to the presence of benign
glands at the margin and the use of ultrasensitive
methods.60–62 From a pathologist’s viewpoint, Gleason score
6 is still cancer, with many of the same morphologic and
even molecular features of higher-grade cancer, a lack of a
basal cell layer, and the potential to locally invade.63,64
Furthermore, whereas pure Gleason score 3þ3¼6 cancer at
RP may be associated with a favorable clinical course, when
present on biopsy, upgrading at RP can be seen in 17% to
36% of cases.65–68 Renaming Gleason score 3 þ 3 ¼ 6 cancer
as an indolent lesion of epithelial origin tumor on biopsy
carries the risk that patients on active surveillance will not
adhere to long-term follow-up because they have been told
they do not have cancer. Rather than renaming Gleason
score 3 þ 3 ¼ 6 cancer as an indolent lesion of epithelial
origin tumor, a new grading system for prostate cancer is
needed to better align the grades with prognosis.
If one were starting de novo in developing a new prostate
cancer grading system, the goal would be a simple system
with the least number of grades, each with its own distinct
prognosis. The Grade Groups (Table) were originally
developed by the senior author of this work in 2013 on
the data from 7869 patients who underwent RP at The Johns
Hopkins Hospital, Baltimore, Maryland,69 and more recently
validated on 20 845 patients from 5 academic institutions.32
The 5-year biochemical risk-free survivals for the 5 Grade
Groups based on RP grade were 96%, 88%, 63%, 48%, and
26% (Figure 4). The 5 Grade Groups were also predictive for
biopsy grade followed by RP or radiation therapy.
Benefits of the New Grading System
First, the New Grading System Provides More
Accurate Grade Stratification Than Current Applica-
tions of the Gleason System.—In clinical practice, Gleason
score 7 disease is often considered one grade regardless of
pattern composition (3 þ 4 versus 4 þ 3). The most common
prognostic classification system used for prostate cancer in
clinical practice is the D’Amico/National Comprehensive
Cancer Network system, which divides prostate cancer into
low-, intermediate-, and high-risk disease.70 In the inter-
mediate category, one of the criteria is Gleason score 7
cancer. Based on this risk stratification, treatment protocols
have been developed without recognizing the extensive
literature showing the significantly different prognosis
between Gleason scores 3 þ 4 versus 4 þ 3 prostate

1147
 cancers.71–73 Similarly, Gleason scores 8 to 10 are combined
together as high-risk disease, despite numerous studies
demonstrating that Gleason scores 9 to 10 are associated
with a significantly worse prognosis. Having a distinct
Grade Group 2 for Gleason score 3þ4¼7 and Grade Group
3 for Gleason score 4 þ 3 ¼ 7 will prevent combining these
two very different prognostic groups of cancer for both
prognostic and treatment purposes. Similarly, Grade
Groups 4 and 5, representing Gleason score 8 and Gleason
scores 9 to 10, respectively, will allow better stratification
and foster future studies to determine whether Grade Group
5 cancers need more intensive therapy.
Second, the New Grading System Is Simple, With 5
Grade Groups as Opposed to 25 Scores Depending on
Various Gleason Pattern Combinations.—The current
Gleason system, with its primary and secondary patterns, is
a complicated and nonintuitive grading system, whereas
grading systems used for other tumors usually range simply
from 1 to 3 (well, moderately, and poorly differentiated), or
low to high grade. For nonurologists and patients, the
system is confusing and difficult to understand. As patients
increasingly have access to their medical records and are
becoming more involved in their medical care, men with
prostate cancer read their pathology reports and need to
understand the terminology better.
Third, the Lowest Grade in the New System Is 1 as
Opposed to 6 in the Gleason System.—There is wide
recognition that many Gleason score 6 cancers can be
followed with active surveillance. However, active surveil-
lance is still not widely accepted in many parts of the world
because of the fear of not being treated definitively for
cancer. In addition, a sizable amount of men abandon active
surveillance despite favorable clinical and pathologic find-
ings because of this anxiety.74,75 Compounding this fear is
that the lowest grade assigned in the Gleason system is 6
out of a scale of 2 to 10, implying that a 6 is in the middle of
the grading scale in terms of aggressiveness.8 In talking to
patients on a daily basis, we have had to reassure numerous
men that their Gleason score 6 cancer is the lowest grade
possible. In addition, some patients with Gleason score 3þ4
¼ 7 had thought they were going to die in the near future
because their score of 7 was closer to the highest grade of 10
than the lowest grade of 2. With the new grading system,
patients can be reassured that they have a Grade Group 1
out of 5, which is the lowest grade, or a Grade Group 2 out
of 5, which is still a relatively low grade.

 outlined above, the diagram has undergone several signif-
icant modifications, most recently in 2014. However, the
latest schematic diagram still suffers from including patterns
1 and 2, despite their near extinction from practice. In
addition, a schematic diagram—even one developed with
contemporary technologies—cannot depict morphology as
accurately as a photomicrograph. In response to these
issues, a contemporary prostate cancer grading photomi-
crograph montage was created.8
Terminology for the New Grading System
There has been some confusion and controversy in the
recent literature regarding the name of the new system. As
noted earlier, the new grading system was first described in
2013 by work done at The Johns Hopkins Hospital by one of
us (J.I.E.) and was verified by a large multi-institutional
study led by the same author, both prior to the 2014
consensus conference. The new system was termed Grade
Groups. The data from these two studies, and the rationale
and evidence in support of the new grading system were
presented to the attendees of the 2014 conference, where
90% voted to accept the new grading system. Although the
2005 and 2014 ISUP consensus conferences, which were
both led by one of us (J.I.E.) were instrumental in many of
the grade changes outlined in this article and will be
influential in the new grading system’s eventual broader
acceptance, the ISUP conferences did not come up with the
concept, nor did they do the research that lead to the new 5
Grade Groups grading system. To therefore rename the
grading system solely as the ISUP Grading System is
misleading and inaccurate. Proponents of crediting the
new system to ISUP argue that because the initial study
describing Grade Groups was in 2013 and the validation
study was finished before the 2014 consensus conference,
then the changes from the 2014 conference were not
incorporated within the data. However, the key recommen-
dation from the 2014 consensus conference that all
cribriform cancers are pattern 4 was already adopted by
the groups that participated in the Hopkins and validation
studies. As described earlier in this article, the 2005
consensus conference allowed only rare cribriform glands
as pattern 3. However, by 2008 even those cases were
recognized as pattern 4.21 The 2014 consensus conference
officially proclaimed what was already in practice shortly
after the 2005 conference. Consequently, grading data from
2005 forward can be accepted as contemporary grades. The
2016 edition of the World Health Organization’s Pathology
and Genetics of Tumours of the Urinary System and Male
Genital Organs refers to the new grading system simply as
Grade Groups 1–5 as originally described69 to be reported
along with the Gleason score for the foreseeable future. As a
result of significant differences in criteria and reporting
compared with Gleason’s original grading system, we have
regarded the newly proposed grades as a ‘‘new grading
system,’’ although one could also consider it as a ‘‘novel
grouping’’ of a much modified original Gleason grading
system.
REPORTING BIOPSY AND RP SPECIMENS
Needle Biopsy Specimens
To ease the transition to the new grading system, it was
agreed upon that both the Gleason grade and the Grade
Group would be included in the reports.8 In our reports we
provide a diagnostic comment with the references and
explanation of the Grade Groups (Figure 5). Each core is
assigned a separate grade.76 For specimens with multiple
cores submitted in a single container, each core should be
interpreted separately if they are differentially inked to
correlate to where they were taken from in the gland.7 If
there are multiple cores without designation in the same
container, experts are split as to whether to still assign
different scores to different cores or just provide a single
score for the container. If the specimen shows fragmented
cores with different grades, then we report the overall grade
for the entire fragmented specimen as if it was one core.
It is optional whether to provide a summary overall
(average or global) score to the entire case. The difficulty
with doing so relates to the multifocal nature of prostate
cancer. For example, one could have several cores with
Gleason score 4 þ 4 ¼ 8 and other cores with 3 þ 3 ¼ 6 and 3
þ 4 ¼ 7. If this reflected a single tumor nodule, the overall
grade could be 3 þ 4 ¼ 7 or 4 þ 3 ¼ 7. However, it could also
reflect sampling separate tumor nodules of 4 þ 4 ¼ 8 and 3 þ
4¼7 or 4þ3¼7. In our opinion it is best left to the clinician,
who may have more information than the pathologist in
terms of findings on imaging studies, to determine the
overall grade. In general, pathologists in the United States

both Gleason score and Grade Group.

1149
 do not assign an overall grade at the end of the case, and
clinicians use the core with the highest grade in a biopsy to
determine the prognosis and therapy.
RP Specimens
Each separate tumor nodule should be assigned an
individual Gleason score/Grade Group.7,8 It is particularly
important when there are 2 or more spatially separate tumor
nodules with different grades. The nodule defining the
prognosis is usually the largest nodule with the highest
stage and grade cancer. However, occasionally there may be
a smaller nodule that is of the highest grade, which will be
recorded as the grade for the case for prognostic and
adjuvant therapy purposes. This requires that RPs be
processed in an organized fashion where one can assess
the relationship between the sections with cancer. If
prostatectomy specimens are not submitted in their entirety,
there are partial submission techniques to maximize
identification of key pathologic parameters.77–80 It should
be recognized that African American patients have a
tendency to have dominant tumor nodules located in the
anterior gland that could be sampled less by partial
submission protocols.66,67 In addition to the tumor’s
Gleason score, the grade of the tumor at a positive margin
site, as well as the length of positive margin, is also
prognostic and should be reported.81–83
Percent Pattern 4
There are multiple advantages to reporting percent
pattern 4 both in needle biopsy and RP specimens. The
2014 consensus conference recommends reporting the
percent pattern 4, with discretion regarding how to record
it. These authors record percent pattern 4 for each core with
Gleason score 7, unless there are several cores with Gleason
score 7 in a jar, whereby the overall percent pattern 4 is
recorded for that jar. One option is to record percent pattern
4 in intervals of less than 5%, 5%, 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%,
approaching 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, and 90%. An alternative
would be less than 5%, 5% to less than 25%, 25% to less
than 50%, 50% to less than 75%, and 75% to less than
100%. It is most critical to determine whether the percent
pattern 4 is very limited (ie, borderline between Gleason
scores 3 þ 3 ¼ 6 and 3 þ 4 ¼ 7), close to 50% (ie, borderline
between Gleason scores 3 þ 4 ¼ 7 and 4 þ 3 ¼ 7), or closer to
90% (ie, borderline between Gleason scores 4 þ 3 ¼ 7 and 4
þ 4 ¼ 8). If there is Gleason score 9 to 10 on any core, we do
not record the percent pattern 4 for Gleason score 7 on
other cores, because it will not affect therapy. We also do
not record percent pattern 4 in a small focus of Gleason
score 7 cancer occupying less than 5% of a core because
grading only a few glands can radically change the percent
pattern 4. The following are the advantages of reporting
percent pattern 4:
1. Currently, many pathologists use two different grading
systems for needle biopsy and RP specimens. One
situation is with a tumor with more than 95% pattern
3 and a minimal amount of pattern 4. In needle biopsies,
any pattern 4 is factored into the grade (ie, Gleason score
3 þ 4 ¼ 7). In RPs, if pattern 4 is less than 5%, then some
pathologists would grade it as Gleason score 3 þ 3 ¼ 6
with tertiary pattern 4, and if greater than 5%, then it
would be graded as Gleason score 3 þ 4 ¼ 7. If the
percent pattern 4 is recorded for both specimens, there
would be a uniform grading system in this situation,
grading these cases as Gleason score 3þ4¼7 and noting
the percent pattern 4. Also, the 5% cutoff used for
reporting Gleason score 3 þ 3 ¼ 6 with tertiary pattern 4
on RP as opposed to Gleason score 3 þ 4 ¼ 7 is arbitrary.
By recording the percent pattern 4, there would be a
sliding scale of the percent pattern 4.
2. The major advantage for recording the percent pattern 4
is on biopsies for men being considered for active
surveillance. For the appropriate patient, Gleason score 3
þ 3 ¼ 6 is accepted for men to undergo active
surveillance.67,84 However, there may be some men,
depending on age, comorbidity, extent of cancer,
magnetic resonance imaging findings, patient desire,
etc, who could be candidates for active surveillance with
Gleason score 3 þ 4 ¼ 7 if the pattern 4 is limited.26
Currently, this information is not transparent in pathol-
ogy reports.
3. The amount of pattern 4 is not only used for active
surveillance but could be used for radiation therapy as
well. Currently, there are different radiation therapy
protocols for Gleason score 3 þ 4 versus Gleason score 4
þ 3. A case that is borderline between these two grades
would be apparent if the percent pattern 4 was recorded,
and then other factors (clinical stage, prostate-specific
antigen, number of cores positive, etc) could be used to
decide therapy.
4. When pathologists grade specimens as Gleason scores 3
þ 4 ¼ 7 or 4 þ 3 ¼ 7, they already have to decide what
tumor is pattern 4 or 3, such that to give a percent should
not be that much extra effort.
5. Interobserver reproducibility of reporting percent pat-
terns 4/5 on prostate biopsies is at least as good as that of
reporting Gleason score.85 However, although cribriform
patterns 4 are more easily recognized, there is significant
interobserver variability in the diagnosis of small-volume
pattern 4 composed of poorly formed glands even
between urologic surgical pathologists.25
6. Borderline cases exist between Gleason scores 3 þ 4 and
4 þ 3 that we currently have to flip a coin to decide. If we
record percent pattern 4, these ambiguous cases will be
evident regardless of whether we diagnose Gleason
score 3 þ 4 ¼ 7 with approaching 50% pattern 4, or
Gleason score 4 þ 3 ¼ 7 with 60% pattern 4. This could
also help explain potential differences in grading the
same case between pathologists.
7. Having to record the percent poorly formed/fused/
cribriform glands in a borderline case between Gleason
scores 3 þ 3 and 3 þ 4 is another way of having
pathologists check again to specifically identify the foci
that lack well-formed glands before verifying that there
is pattern 4.
8. Increasing percent pattern 4, quantified in a continuous
scale, is associated with an increased risk of biochemical
failure after RP.86
Tertiary Patterns
Numerous studies have demonstrated that a tertiary (third
most common) pattern in RP specimens is prognostic,
basically worsening the prognosis yet not as bad as the next
higher score.87–90 A controversy that was resolved in the
2014 consensus conference was that in order for percent of
pattern 5 to be considered as a tertiary pattern it should
occupy less than 5% of the tumor nodule. In the past, others
1150
Arch Pathol Lab Med—Vol 140, October 2016
New Prostate Cancer Grading System—Kryvenko & Epstein
 allowed a much greater percent of pattern 5 as long as it was
the third most common pattern. On RP, 3 þ 4 ¼ 7 with less
than 5% pattern 5 is called 3 þ 4 ¼ 7 with tertiary 5 (Grade
Group 2 with minor high-grade pattern), and 3 þ 4 ¼ 7 with
more than 5% pattern 5 is called 3 þ 5 ¼ 8 (Grade Group 4).
On RP, 4þ3¼ 7 with less than 5% pattern 5 is called 4þ 3¼
7 with tertiary 5 (Grade Group 3 with minor high-grade
pattern), and 4 þ 3 ¼ 7 with more than 5% pattern 5 is called
4þ5¼9 (Grade Group 5). For example, the prognosis of 3þ
4 ¼ 7 with tertiary pattern 5 is in between 3 þ 4 ¼ 7 and 4 þ 3
¼7. The grade Gleason score 3þ3¼6 with tertiary pattern 4
will no longer be used. As discussed above, these will be
graded as Gleason score 3 þ 4 ¼ 7 with 5% or less pattern 4.
Similarly, Gleason score 4 þ 4 ¼ 8 with tertiary pattern 5 is
no longer recommended because the prognosis is the same
as Gleason score 4 þ 5 ¼ 9.
Tertiary patterns are not recorded on needle biopsy. The
usual situation with 3-grade patterns is a core with Gleason
patterns 3, 4, and 5. The Gleason score is determined by
adding the most common pattern with the highest-grade
pattern and typically not mentioning the remaining pattern.
As it relates to three patterns on needle biopsy: 3 þ 4 ¼ 7
with a lesser amount of 5 is called 3þ5¼8 (Grade Group 4),
and 4 þ 3 ¼ 7 with a lesser amount of 5 is called 4 þ 5 ¼ 9
(Grade Group 5).
SUMMARY
As the clinical field of prostate cancer has changed
dramatically during the last few decades, so too has the
grading of prostate cancer. These changes will enable
clinicians to better manage prostate cancer patients, which
is the ultimate goal of any grading system. Initially, the new
grading system for prostate cancer will be a ‘‘translation’’
from the much modified original Gleason system (ie,
Gleason score 3 þ 3 ¼ 6 ¼ Grade Group 1). However,
ultimately pathologists and clinicians will learn the new
system directly (ie, Grade Group 1 ¼ discrete, well-formed
glands) without the need to ‘‘think in Gleason.’’
