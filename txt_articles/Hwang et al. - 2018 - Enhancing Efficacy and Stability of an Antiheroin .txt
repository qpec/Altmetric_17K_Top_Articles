Abstract
In recent years, drug conjugate vaccines have shown promise as therapeutics for substance use 
disorder. As a means to improve the efficacy of a heroin conjugate vaccine, we systematically 
explored 20 vaccine formulations with varying combinations of carrier proteins and adjuvants. In 
regard to adjuvants, we explored a Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) agonist and a TLR3 agonist in the 
presence of alum. The TLR9 agonist was cytosine-guanine oligodeoxynucleotide 1826 (CpG ODN 
1826), while the TLR3 agonist was virus-derived genomic doubled-stranded RNA (dsRNA). The 
vaccine formulations containing TLR3 or TLR9 agonist alone elicited strong antiheroin antibody 
titers and blockade of heroin-induced antinociception when formulated with alum; however, a 
combination of TLR3 and TLR9 adjuvants did not result in improved efficacy. Investigation of 
month-long stability of the two lead formulations revealed that the TLR9 but not the TLR3 
formulation was stable when stored as a lyophilized solid or as a liquid over 30 days. Furthermore, 
mice immunized with the TLR9 + alum heroin vaccine gained significant protection from lethal 
heroin doses, suggesting that this vaccine formulation is suitable for mitigating the harmful effects 
of heroin, even following month-long storage at room temperature.

INTRODUCTION
Heroin is a schedule I, highly addictive opioid drug and a significant public health concern. 
In the United States (US), drug overdose deaths have nearly tripled between 1999 and 
2014.1 In 2015, 52 404 overdose deaths were reported, 63% of which involved opioids.1 
Recently, there has been a marked increase in prescriptions of synthetic opioid pain relievers 
(OPRs) for management of chronic pain.2 Evidence suggests that misuse of OPRs is the 
strongest risk factor for initiating heroin abuse, and OPR users are 40-times more likely to 
abuse heroin.3,4 This phenomenon is driven by the relatively low cost of heroin and its wide 
availability.3,4 Current treatments for heroin addiction involve opioid replacement therapy, 
for example, methadone administration, to promote heroin detoxification.5 Unfortunately, 
the addictive nature of heroin and other opioids, combined with the adverse effects of 
withdrawal and high cost of treatment, leads to a high incidence of drug relapse.4 In the face 
of increasing opioid abuse and overdose, the development of improved therapies that can 
attenuate the effects of opioids is crucial.
Vaccination is a promising strategy to promote cessation of heroin abuse and prevent relapse. 
Implementation of this strategy involves active immunization using a small molecule–
protein conjugate, which elicits high-affinity, drug-specific antibodies. These polyclonal IgG 
antibodies sequester free drug in the blood and prevent access to the brain, subsequently 
reducing the drug compound’s psychoactive effects. This approach has been preclinically 
validated for vaccines against nicotine,6,7 cocaine,8,9 and methamphetamine.10,11 For heroin 
specifically, vaccination efficacy has been repeatedly demonstrated in mice, rats, and 
nonhuman primates.12–18
In general, formulation of a vaccine with an adjuvant is an attractive approach to enhance the 
magnitude and length of vaccine immunity against the target antigen by stimulating antigen 
presenting cells, T-cells or B-cells. Historically, Alhydrogel (alum) has been the most 
commonly used adjuvant, but numerous alternatives have been pursued in recent years.19

 Adjuvants can act as pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), which activate Toll-
like receptors (TLRs) resulting in upregulation of an immune response. Specific PAMPs 
include lipopolysaccharides (LPS), double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), and unmethylated 
cytosine-guanine (CpG) motifs.19 However, at this time only a limited number of adjuvants 
are approved for use in humans. By exploring new adjuvants or combinations of adjuvants, 
we can rationally design vaccines with enhanced immunogenicity directed toward 
production of heroin-neutralizing antibodies.
CpG oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN) 1826 is a class-B ODN that stimulates B-cell responses 
though TLR920,21 and was recently shown to elicit robust titers in antiheroin vaccine studies.
13,22 Natural or synthetic dsRNA, for example, polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (poly I:C), is 
a molecular pattern associated with viral replication, which elicits an immune response via 
TLR3 and has been used as an effective adjuvant in several vaccine studies.23–25 Given the 
potent immunostimulatory capacity of viral or bacterial PAMPs, we were interested in 
evaluating the efficacy of a yeast-derived viral dsRNA genome relative to CpG ODN using a 
well-studied dsRNA virus of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, L-A.26 To date, only the L-BC viral 
dsRNA genome generated from infected S. cerevisiae has been used as an adjuvant, where it 
increased immunogenicity of a prophylactic viral vaccine in mice.27
Here, we investigate L-A-derived dsRNA in combination with alum or CpG ODN in the 
context of our drug of abuse vaccine. Although alum is not necessary for TLR activation, it 
is one of the few adjuvants used in FDA-approved vaccines and has shown promising 
activity in antidrug vaccines. In comparison to alum, we selected conjugatable adjuvant lipid 
vesicles (CALV) as an alternative vehicle for vaccine delivery.28 CALVs are nanoparticulate 
liposomes designed to effectively deliver encapsulated antigens for immune uptake.
Our most successful antiheroin vaccine to date involves a second generation heroin hapten 
adjuvanted with alum and CpG (7, Figure 1).22 We used this formulation as a benchmark 
while investigating new adjuvant combinations and formulation conditions in an effort to 
find a lead vaccine candidate. We then measured the effects of adjuvant dosing on vaccine 
efficacy, and the vaccines were tested under various storage conditions for stability as a 
liquid or lyophilized solid after mixing with alum adjuvant and trehalose as a cryoprotectant. 
Our most successful formulation was then selected for an overdose challenge to see if 
protection was conferred against a lethal dose of heroin.
EXPERIMENTAL SECTION
Synthesis of Heroin Haptens and Conjugation to Carrier Proteins
The synthesis and characterization of the heroin haptens and immunoconjugates are 
described in detail in the Supporting Information (Figures S1–S14) along with additional 
information on animals, formulation conditions, vaccine administration schedule, behavioral 
testing, ELISA, and other experimental data. Our key hapten design element is a 
strategically placed linker on the morphinan nitrogen that ultimately presents an immune 
epitope with high structural congruence to heroin (7, Figure 1 and Scheme S1).22 We also 
prepared a heroin hapten with a truncated linker at this same position to probe the effect of 
linker length on vaccine efficacy (11, Figures 1 and S1). The haptens were activated and

 conjugated to carrier protein tetanus toxoid (TT) or a mutant diphtheria toxoid (CRM), using 
an EDC-mediated coupling reaction (Figure 1), followed by dialysis against pH 7.4 
phosphate buffered saline (PBS). The degree of haptenation was determined by MALDI-ToF 
mass spectrometry using a heroin-bovine serum albumin (Her-BSA) immunoconjugate as a 
surrogate for determining hapten density (Figures S9–S14). Immunoconjugates were stored 
at −80 °C until the day of formulation and vaccination. More information on the synthesis 
and characterization data are described in the Supporting Information.
Vaccine Formulation
After conjugation of the proteins, immunoconjugates were formulated with different 
adjuvants as described in Tables S1–S5. The adjuvants were CpG ODN 1826, dsRNA, 
Alhydrogel (alum), and VesiVax CALV.28 CpG ODN 1826 is a phosphorothioated 
oligonucleotide with the following sequence (5′ to 3′): TCCATGACGTTCCTGACGTT. 
The 4.6 kb viral dsRNA was derived from L-A infected S. cerevisiae (ATCC #22244). The 
viral dsRNA can be prepared according to literature procedure involving fermentation of 
killer yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae (ATCC 22244), containing the L-A virus grown in 
Difco YM media (Becton Dickson).29–31 The VesiVax CALV liposomes and dsRNA were 
obtained from Molecular Express, Inc. Each vaccine was prepared by shaking the mixture 
for 20 min prior to injection. The delivered dose of each component was 50 μg of 
immunoconjugate, 50 μg of CpG ODN 1826 or dsRNA, and 1 mg of alum per animal for 
each injection, unless noted otherwise in Table 1 and Tables S1–S5.
Chemical Stability Studies of Individual Vaccine Components
A systematic analysis of individual components under various storage conditions was 
performed to monitor potential unwanted degradation. Lack of chemical stability may 
represent potential causal factors for any change in potency that is observed over time. 
Samples were prepared according to standard vaccine formulation conditions and listed in 
Table S6. To perform these studies, we ran TBE-Urea gels for CpG, agarose gel, UV–vis 
analysis and E-Gels for dsRNA, and SDS-PAGE gels for tetanus toxoid (TT) under various 
storage conditions. Results from stability studies are in the Supporting Information (Table 
S6 and Figures S22–S28).
Animals and Vaccine Administration
All studies were performed in compliance with the Scripps Institutional Animal Care and 
Use Committee and all protocols adhered to the National Institute of Health Guide for the 
Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. Male Swiss Webster mice (Taconic Farms, 
Germantown, NY; 6–8 weeks old; 25–30 g) were immunized subcutaneously (s.c.) on days 
0, 14, and 28, unless noted otherwise (Figure S15–S17; Tables S1–S5). Exact formulation 
parameters are given for each group in Tables S1–S5. All animals in a given series were run 
at the same time, except for Series D and G. The bold lines separating the series indicate that 
the series were run in two sets, instead of simultaneously (Tables S2 and S5). Mice were 
bled on day 38 using retro-orbital puncture to collect approximately 100–150 μL of whole 
blood, unless noted otherwise. Groups were composed of 4 to 6 mice. Mice were group-
housed in an AAALAC-accredited vivarium containing temperature and humidity controlled

 rooms and kept on a reverse light cycle (lights on: 9 PM–9 AM). Immunoconjugate 12a with 
the shortened linker hapten was used in Group B4 and the hapten 11 was termed H(s) in 
Tables 1 and S1.
Antinociception Assays
On week 6, antinociceptive responses under escalating heroin doses were evaluated to 
determine vaccine-mediated blockade of heroin psychoactivity.32 A set of mice was tested 
for spinal (tail immersion) and supraspinal (hot plate) antinociceptive responses to thermal 
stimuli at 54 °C, according to our laboratory procedure.33 Following administration of the 
drug, the analgesic effect (represented as maximal possible effect, % MPE) was measured 
for each test after every dose. The data were then fit using a nonlinear regression in 
GraphPad PRISM to determine ED50 values. The ED50 is calculated from plotting the 
%MPE with respect to heroin dose. Since the effect is based on %MPE, the ED50 describes 
when 50% of the animals within a group experienced the maximum effect of heroin-induced 
antinociception.
ELISAs
Bleeds were taken on weeks 6 and 10 for Series B, and maximum titer levels occurred at 
week 6 (Figure S18). Therefore, we opted to perform bleeds on day 38 for Series C–G and 
perform antinociception assays around week 6. Since heroin is rapidly metabolized to 6-AM 
before entering the brain,34,35 an ELISA using heroin or 6-monoacetylmorphine (6-AM) as 
coating antigens was performed for Series E to characterize antigen specificity of the 
antibody response. The equivalent titer response to coating antigen may suggest that the 
heroin immunoconjugate hydrolyzes to 6-AM before or during antigen presentation (Figure 
S19). Additional information on ELISAs is described in the Supporting Information.
Analyzing Cross-Reactivity of Polyclonal Antiheroin Antibodies by Surface Plasmon 
Resonance
The binding IC50 for mouse serum IgGs from Group G6 and 6-AM was determined by 
competitive binding assay via surface plasmon resonance (SPR) using a Biacore 3000 
instrument (GE Healthcare) equipped with a research-grade CM5 sensor chip according to 
literature methods.36 Diluted mouse serum from day 38 was incubated with serial dilutions 
of heroin, 6-AM, methadone, oxycodone, naloxone, buprenorphine, norbuprenorphine, 
naltrexone, and morphine and injected into a Biacore 3000 containing a Her-BSA-loaded 
sensor chip. The heroin–BSA conjugate was immobilized on the sensor chip using a NHS, 
EDC-mediated coupling reaction. The conjugate was resuspended in 10 mM sodium acetate 
(pH 4.0) was immobilized at a density of 5000 RU on flow cell 2, whereas flow cell 1 was 
immobilized with BSA at the same density to serve as a reference surface. All the surfaces 
were blocked with a 7 min injection of 1.0 M ethanolamine-HCl (pH 8.5). The pooled 
mouse sera was diluted in running buffer (HBS-EP + buffer) and titrated on both coated flow 
cells so as to give a response of ~100 RU within 3 min of injection and 2.5 min dissociation 
at a flow rate of 30 μL/min. The chip surface was regenerated by injection of 10 mM Gly-
HCl (pH 1.5) for 30 s before the next round of assays. Signal produced by antibody binding

 to the SPR chip without drug present was used as a reference for 100% binding. Rapid 
hydrolysis of heroin interfered with collecting sufficient binding data.
Statistical Analysis
Tests for homogeneity of variance and normal distribution were performed on behavioral 
observation test scores. If conditions were met, analyses of variance (ANOVAs) were 
performed. Results were analyzed via one-way ANOVA with Dunnett’s post hoc 
comparisons for titers and Tukey’s post hoc test for analgesia. Pearson correlation 
coefficient was used to test the linear relationship between antiheroin midpoint titers to 
analgesia results for all animals tested (hot plate, P = 0.002, R2 = 0.093, Figure S21A,C; tail 
immersion, P = 0.009, R2 = 0.047, Figure S21B,D). However, there is no meaningful 
correlation between titers and antinociception data; titer data are reflective of antibody 
binding to hapten and not necessarily to free drug.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
To evaluate the series of heroin vaccine formulations, mice (n = 4–6/group) were vaccinated 
subcutaneously (s.c.) with the specific formulations listed in Tables S1–S5. Series A–C were 
designed to broadly explore the scope of vaccine conditions with the new dsRNA adjuvant 
in multiple contexts and to compare the adjuvant to our most successful heroin vaccine: Her-
TT adjuvanted with 50 ug CpG adjuvanted and 1 mg of alum (Group A6). We used our 
previously reported second-generation heroin hapten17 in the majority of our formulations 
(7, Figure 1), although a truncated heroin hapten (11, Figure 1) was compared to 7 and 
showed no difference in behavioral efficacy (Group B4, Table 1). Moreover, ELISA results 
revealed that antibody titers for both hapten 7 and 11 vaccination groups were similar 
regardless of coating antigens (8c and 12b), suggesting that the hapten linker does not 
noticeably affect immunogenicity or antibody–hapten binding (Figure S19A,B). In moving 
forward with hapten 7, optimization of vaccine formulation conditions for the dsRNA 
included varying the carrier protein, the delivery system (i.e., CALV liposomal delivery or 
alum as a depot), and combining CpG and dsRNA. Findings from the first three series 
(highlighted in red in Table 1) were used to guide successive series of refinement. The 
subsequent Series D and E were designed to focus on a specific TLR agonist and observe its 
response to dose ranging with alum. After establishing an optimal dose with each TLR 
agonist, the integrity of the vaccine was tested under various storage conditions (Series F 
and G).
Following behavioral assays and titer measurements of all the series, a one-way ANOVA 
was performed on the resulting data (Table 1). The ANOVA confirmed a significant effect of 
formulation conditions in the hot plate assay [F (37, 135) = 5.851; p < 0.001]. A similar 
result was observed for the ANOVA in the tail flick assay [F (37,135) = 22.92; p < 0.001]. A 
Dunnett or Tukey post hoc test was then used to confirm significance among the groups. In 
Series A–C, we observed several interesting trends pertaining to (1) RNA versus DNA-based 
adjuvants, (2) carrier protein, (3) delivery vehicle, and (4) preliminary vaccine stability 
(Figure 2).

 Comparison of CpG and dsRNA as adjuvants revealed equipotency in the context of TT as 
the carrier protein coadministered with alum (Figure 2A). Intriguingly, the addition of CpG 
to the dsRNA/TT/alum formulation did not improve efficacy (Group B2, Figure 2A), 
indicating that the adjuvants do not act synergistically and may possibly interfere with each 
other’s adjuvant effects.
When a nontoxic mutant of diphtheria toxin, CRM, was employed as a carrier in eliciting an 
immunogenic response, we found that CRM adjuvanted with dsRNA was superior in both 
antinociception assays, as compared to TT (p < 0.001, Figure 2B). However, despite this 
increased efficacy, we opted to perform the rest of the vaccine studies with TT due to the 
fact that the CRM conjugate had an unfortunate tendency to precipitate upon storage. In 
comparing CALV liposomes and alum, antiheroin antibody titers were higher in alum 
formulations than liposomal formulations (Groups D6 and C2 found in Figures 2C and 
S20F, respectively). Moreover, CALV formulations (Groups A4, C1–C3 Figure 2, Table 1) 
were not as effective as vaccines containing alum in protecting mice from heroin-induced 
antinociception (Figure 2C, Table 1). A notable difference in efficacy was observed when 
CRM was adjuvanted with alum versus CALV liposomes, although this trend was not 
observed for TT. It is possible that the large disparity between the two delivery conditions 
may be due to the marked aggregation of Her-CRM during conjugation, which would 
impede subsequent encapsulation by liposomes. On the other hand, Her-TT’s solubility 
would theoretically permit encapsulation by CALV liposomes, possibly explaining the fact 
that CALV Her-TT liposomes gave the same magnitude of protection against heroin 
compared to Her-TT adjuvanted with a low dose of alum (0.2 mg/dose). On the basis of the 
finding that CALV was moderately effective as a Her-TT adjuvant, but never superior to 
alum, we did not move forward with CALV in our DNA and RNA dose-ranging studies.
Series D and E: RNA and DNA Adjuvant Dose-Ranging with Alum
In any vaccine, the beneficial immunopotentiation of adjuvants needs to be balanced against 
the risk of adverse side effects. Unfortunately, potent adjuvant action is often correlated with 
increased toxicity, presenting as inflammation at the site of immunization. Even adjuvants 
used in FDA-approved vaccines like alum are known to produce inflammation at the 
injection site.37,38 Preliminary assessment of toxicities in Series A–C showed occasional 
injection site redness and swelling, particularly in formulations containing dsRNA. Although 
injection site reactions are typical with alum-containing vaccines, we hypothesized that 
refining adjuvant dosing parameters might reduce the incidence and severity of these 
reactions.
Initial screenings of candidate formulations suggested that the preparations containing both 
dsRNA and alum yielded superb antibody and antinociceptive responses (Table 1). We 
specifically investigated different dsRNA to alum ratios in the mouse antinociception models 
to further refine the vaccine formulation. We hypothesized that at lower doses of alum or 
dsRNA, we might be able to lessen the severity of the injection site reactions without an 
appreciable loss of immunogenicity. Increasing the amount of dsRNA in vaccine 
formulations with 1 mg of alum (Groups D2–D4, Table 1) increased the size or incidence of 
injection site reactions. The increased inflammatory effect was also reflected in an increase

 in vaccine efficacy in the tail immersion response but not in hot plate antinociception test 
(Figure 3A,B). However, we found that lower doses of alum (0.2 mg) dramatically reduced 
the injection site reactions without compromising the efficacy of the vaccine for the dsRNA 
series (Figure 3A,B,D). In terms of the CpG series, we found that decreasing the alum had 
no effect on efficacy and that CpG formulations with the lowest alum dose were still 
adequately efficacious (Figure 3E,F). CpG dosing was previously reported and demonstrated 
a positive correlation between vaccine efficacy and CpG dose with no increase in adverse 
reactions.22
Series F and G: Potency Time-Course Studies of Vaccines under Various Storage 
Conditions and Time Periods
Another important goal in vaccine design is achieving long-term shelf stability without loss 
in efficacy, typically via lyophilization. Recently, it was suggested that our hapten was 
unstable due to the presence of labile ester groups and subsequently was expected to exhibit 
a “limited shelf-life” due to undesired degradation during storage.16 To examine the clinical 
viability of our heroin vaccine, we initiated potency studies over various time points and 
storage conditions to test its efficacy against heroin over time. Consequently, protection of 
the vaccine components against damage during the freezing and drying process is essential.
39 Trehalose can be used as an effective cryoprotectant to prevent alum aggregation during 
lyophilization,40,41 and therefore, we investigated the stability and efficacy of our heroin 
vaccines under various storage conditions in the presence of trehalose.
In a preliminary study, we tested a lyophilized vaccine formulation containing 15% w/v 
trehalose as a cryoprotectant (Group B3, Table 1). When immunized with the reconstituted 
vaccine, this group demonstrated similar efficacy to the nonlyophilized vaccine Group B2 in 
antinociceptive assays (Figure 2A, Table 1). This initial result prompted us to explore a 
broader range of conditions for each nucleotide-based adjuvant and their relative shelf 
stability over time. In addition, before initiating full 30-day potency time-course studies, we 
tested a range of trehalose concentrations with three concentrations of alum and qualitatively 
assessed undesired alum aggregation (Figure S27). Chemical stability studies were also 
conducted on each individual and combined vaccine component to assess for degradation 
under conditions such as freezing in liquid nitrogen or lyophilization. The results of the 
studies are in Figures S22–S28 using dosing parameters of the most promising vaccine 
conditions for each series. It was determined that each component was found to be relatively 
stable over time and under different storage conditions.
We also noted that alum was found to bind antigen in phosphate buffered saline (Figures 
S22–S24, S26, and S28), which was not expected considering that negligible binding was 
observed both Haemophilus influenza type b and meningococcal group C conjugate vaccines 
in phosphate buffered saline with alum.42 However, in the case of our heroin conjugate 
vaccine, alum retains its ability to bind antigen even after lyophilization and resuspension.
For both the dsRNA and CpG series, Her-TT immunoconjugate was formulated with 
trehalose and dsRNA or CpG, samples were initially stored in the −80 °C freezer, defrosted, 
mixed with alum, and then subjected to the following storage conditions (Figure S16): (1) 
formulated with alum 1 day before injection and stored as a liquid at 4 °C (Groups F1 and 
Hwang et al.

 G1); (2) formulated with alum 30 days before injection and stored as a liquid at 4 °C 
(Groups F2 and G2) or stored at room temperature (RT, Group G6); (3) formulated with 
alum 1 day before injection, lyophilized, and stored at RT (Groups F3, G3, and G7); (5) 
formulated with alum 30 days before injection, lyophilized, and stored at RT (Groups F4, 
G4, and G8, Table 1). As a negative control in the CpG series, Groups G1–G4, Table 1 were 
spiked with a lower amount of trehalose (>5%) to measure its effect on protection from 
lyophilization. On the day of injection, all lyophilized samples were resuspended in water 
via 20 min of vortex mixing, then administered to mice.
In interpreting the dsRNA series results, lyophilized vaccines (Groups F3 and F4) were not 
as effective in tail immersion and hot plate thermal nociception as compared to liquid 
storage for 1 day (Group F1, Figure 4A,B and Table 1). Samples stored for 30 days also 
showed modestly lower titer levels (Groups F2 and F4, Figure 4C, Table 1). These results 
could be explained by the possible instability of the dsRNA genome at room temperature, as 
cold storage (−20 to −80 °C) is optimal for most extracted DNA samples.43 On the other 
hand, extended incubation and storage apparently enhanced efficacy for the CpG series (G 
Series, Figure 4E–H), possibly due to the formation of immunologically active antigen-alum 
aggregates during storage.44 In assessing the effects of the cryoprotectant, liquid samples 
with CpG were effective regardless of the presence of trehalose over time (Group G2); 
however, lyophilized samples without at least 15% trehalose do not survive under storage 
conditions after 30 days as evidenced by reduced in vivo efficacy (Group G4, Figure 3E–G, 
Table 1). When a sufficient amount of trehalose was used in the vaccine formulations, 
lyophilized vaccines performed better at both one and thirty-day time points in thermal 
nociception assays and titer (G3 vs G7 for 1 day, G4 vs G8 for 30 day lyophilized, Figure 
4E–G, Table 1). Promisingly, the efficacy of the vaccine was retained after 30 days as a 
liquid (G2 and G6) or when lyophilized (G8), and there was no significant difference 
between the samples that were lyophilized 30 days or 1 day prior to injection (G8 and G7, 
respectively, Table 1).
Lethality Challenge with Series G
Upon demonstrating that our vaccine could block substantial doses of heroin in the 
antinociception assay, we examined the ability of our vaccine to mitigate heroin-induced 
lethality. On the basis of the antinociceptive data for the stability studies, we defined an 
efficacious vaccine as a vaccine group having an ED50 ≥ 4.5 mg/kg in at least one measure 
of thermal nociception. Using this criterion, the CpG series with 25% cryoprotectant were 
the most successful. Thus, vaccinated mice (n = 17) from the CpG stability studies and 
nonvaccinated mice (n = 5) were administered a 160 mg/kg dose of heroin and survival was 
measured (Figure 5A). The survival rate for the pooled efficacious vaccine group was 77% 
(10 of 13 mice survived), as compared to 20% survival for the nonvaccinated (1 of 5 mice 
survived, Figure 5B). Taken together, these results clearly indicate that the heroin vaccine is 
highly effective in diminishing the effects of a lethal heroin challenge in rodents.
Cross-Reactivity of Antibodies from Group G6
A major benefit of vaccination over traditional pharmacotherapies stems from the increased 
duration of action of circulating antibodies and decreased side effects. The advancement of a

 heroin vaccine may benefit from a combination therapy with existing drugs, such as 
methadone or burprenorphine, to mitigate opioid cravings during cessation therapy. To test 
whether combination therapy was feasible with our heroin vaccine, we selected Group G6 
(Table 1) from the stability series and characterized the polyclonal antibody response by 
SPR. Sera from Group G6 were pooled to measure the binding affinities of polyclonal 
antibodies in vaccinated mouse serum G6 for heroin, 6-AM, and morphine using a Biacore 
3000 equipped with a Her-BSA-coated chip. Diluted mouse sera was then preincubated with 
serial dilutions of FDA-approved therapeutic opioids (Figure 6A) to test for potential cross-
reactivity that might interfere with combination therapy.
By using the SPR competition assay, it was determined that the polyclonal antibodies from 
G6 had a binding affinity for 6-AM corresponding to ~100 nM. As previously reported,12,22 
this hapten is “dynamic” making antibodies against multiple active species, including 6-AM, 
which is the primary mediator of heroin’s psychoactivity.45
It can also be inferred that the formulation parameters for G6 storage as a liquid at room 
temperature, presents minimal 6-AM hydrolysis over 30 days in phosphate buffered saline 
(pH 7.4) with trehalose (25% w/v) suggesting that alum adsorption may inhibit hydrolysis. 
In addition, it was demonstrated that affinities for FDA-approved opioids were >1000-times 
lower compared to 6-AM (Figure 6B), indicating minimal cross-reactivity to therapeutic 
opioids. These data suggest that Her-TT vaccinated subjects may use pharmacotherapies in 
tandem with vaccination.
We have examined adjuvant formulation and carrier protein in the context of our heroin 
vaccine to improve vaccine efficacy. Substituting CRM197 for TT as a carrier protein gave 
similar efficacy in heroin antinociception tests. Evaluation of an RNA-based adjuvant similar 
to TLR3 agonist poly(I:C), showed an increase in vaccine efficacy versus our previously 
used TLR9 adjuvant, CpG, while a combination of the two was not as effective. 
Furthermore, formulation of the RNA adjuvant without alum or with a liposome (CALV) 
showed poor vaccine efficacy. Dosing of the adjuvants with alum and dsRNA or CpG was 
optimized to reduce injection site reactions while maintaining vaccine efficacy. The RNA-
based adjuvant in combination with a lower dose of alum was promising, while CpG was 
unaffected by alum dosing, so both RNA and DNA adjuvant vaccines were further explored 
in stability studies.
In the dsRNA stability studies, it was determined that vaccines containing dsRNA perform 
the best 1 day after formulation. Liquid dsRNA and CpG samples stored for 30 days at 4 °C 
were comparable, but the CpG vaccine stored as a liquid at RT surpassed both adjuvant 
samples in the measures of vaccine efficacy. In terms of lyophilized treatment, trehalose is 
essential for lyophilized vaccine performance. Both lyophilized CpG samples with 25% 
trehalose (w/v) achieved much higher ED50’s than the lyophilized dsRNA samples. 
Therefore for our lethality challenge, we tested the CpG stability series and found that the 
vaccine conferred protection against a lethal dose of heroin. On the basis of the results of 
this systematic formulation assessment for vaccines against heroin abuse, the CpG + alum 
Her-TT formulation has demonstrated the most promise to move beyond preclinical 
development.

diluted mouse sera from G6. Surface plasmon resonance revealed the IC50 value of 6-AM 
for Group G6 was ~100 nM. The IC50 value of heroin could not be determined by SPR due 
to the rapid hydrolysis of heroin to 6-AM during experimental runs at 37 C for 15 min runs

aAmount of each vaccine component is given as the concentration per dose per mouse, respectively.
bCryoprotectant amounts are given for trehalose as w/v percentages for the total vaccine volume. In vaccines where glycerol was employed, the immunoconjugates were diluted 50% (v/v) with glycerol before being stored at −80 °C. Therefore glycerol content in total vaccine 
volumes ranged from 12 to 25% (v/v).
cBehavioral assay results are reported as the mean heroin ED50 (mg/kg) ± SEM for each vaccine.
dMidpoint titers are reported as the mean antiheroin midpoint titers ± SEM for each vaccine.
eHeroin ED50 (mg/kg) for vehicles did not exhibit antinociceptive protection. However, some controls are noted as zero due to the lack of convergence of the data through PRISM. An appropriate ED50 for these controls can be designated ≥1.0 mg/kg.
fNot detected. Antiheroin antibody titers were not detected in control serum.
gRed section indicates the adjuvant selection studies; the blue section indicates the adjuvant and alum dosing; the green section indicates the stability studies.
