In Brief
DNA damage can activate an innate
immune response. Dunphy et al. show
that the detection of etoposide-induced
damage by ATM causes the non-
canonical activation of the DNA sensing
adaptor STING. This results in the
assembly of an alternative STING
signaling complex and the induction of an
NF-kB-dependent transcriptional
program.

SUMMARY
DNA damage can be sensed as a danger-associated
molecular pattern by the innate immune system.
Here we find that keratinocytes and other human
cells mount an innate immune response within hours
of etoposide-induced DNA damage, which involves
the DNA sensing adaptor STING but is independent
of the cytosolic DNA receptor cGAS. This non-ca-
nonical activation of STING is mediated by the DNA
binding protein IFI16, together with the DNA damage
response factors ATM and PARP-1, resulting in the
assembly of an alternative STING signaling complex
that includes the tumor suppressor p53 and the E3
ubiquitin ligase TRAF6. TRAF6 catalyzes the forma-
tion of K63-linked ubiquitin chains on STING, leading
to the activation of the transcription factor NF-kB and
the induction of an alternative STING-dependent
gene expression program. We propose that STING
acts as a signaling hub that coordinates a transcrip-
tional response depending on its mode of activation.
INTRODUCTION
The innate immune system provides a rapid initial defense pro-
gram against invading pathogens that relies on the recognition
of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) to shape
local immune responses. Innate immune activation can also be
observed in the absence of infection, following the detection of
danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) after injury or
during sterile inflammation. PAMPs and DAMPs are detected
by pattern recognition receptors, which then induce the produc-
tion of interferons, cytokines, and chemokines. Intracellular DNA
receptors recognize double-stranded (ds) DNA as a PAMP dur-
ing infection with DNA viruses and other intracellular pathogens
but can also detect self-DNA as a DAMP under some circum-
stances, for instance, when damaged DNA has leaked into the
cytosol (reviewed by Dhanwani et al., 2018). The key DNA sensor
in the cytosol is cyclic guanosine monophosphate (GMP)-AMP
synthase (cGAS), which catalyzes the synthesis of the second
messenger cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP) (reviewed by Chen
et al., 2016). cGAMP then binds to the DNA sensing adaptor
STING at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), causing a conforma-
tional change associated with the activation of STING dimers
(Cai et al., 2014). In addition to the conformational change
caused by cGAMP binding, STING function is regulated by phos-
phorylation, palmitoylation, sumoylation, and modification with
K63-, K48-, K27-, and K11-linked poly-ubiquitin chains (Chiang
and Gack, 2017; Hu et al., 2016; Mukai et al., 2016). Following
its activation, STING translocates from the ER to signaling com-
partments, where STING associates with the kinase TBK1,
which mediates the activation of the transcription factor inter-
feron regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) and, to a lesser extent, nuclear
factor kB (NF-kB) (Abe and Barber, 2014; Dobbs et al., 2015;
Liu et al., 2015). Both IRF3 and NF-kB are required for the
expression of interferon-b (IFN-b) mRNA.
cGAS-mediated STING activation is crucial for the detection of
DNA from intracellular pathogens. In human monocytes and
keratinocytes, STING activation by cGAS requires the coopera-
tion with the DNA binding protein IFI16 (interferon-g-inducible
factor 16), which shuttles between the nucleus and the cytosol
but is nuclear at steady state (Almine et al., 2017; Jønsson
et al., 2017; Li et al., 2012; Unterholzner et al., 2010). cGAS
can also detect DNA damage in a process involving mitotic pro-
gression, the formation of micronuclei and leakage of DNA into
the cytosol, which occurs several days after recovery from
DNA damage (Dou et al., 2017; Gl€
uck et al., 2017; Harding
et al., 2017; Mackenzie et al., 2017).
dsDNA breaks are also known to induce a more rapid innate
immune response that involves the activation of NF-kB (re-
viewed by Miyamoto, 2011). The transcription factor NF-kB
promotes cell survival and can induce the expression of a variety
of cytokines and chemokines. DNA damage-induced NF-kB
activation can influence tumor progression and clearance of
tumor cells by the immune system after radio- or chemotherapy
(reviewed by Hellweg, 2015). NF-kB activation occurs within the
first hours following the detection of double-strand breaks and

mutated (ATM) and the enzyme poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1
(PARP-1) (Hinz et al., 2010; Piret et al., 1999; Stilmann et al.,
2009). ATM and PARP-1 detect double-strand breaks in the nu-
cleus and signal inside out to activate a cytosolic signaling com-
plex containing the E3 ubiquitin ligase TRAF6, TAK1, TAB2/3,
and the NF-kB inhibitor (IkB) kinase complex (IKKa, IKKb, and
NEMO) (Hinz et al., 2010; Stilmann et al., 2009; Wu et al.,
2010). ATM-dependent NF-kB activation has been observed in
response to ionizing radiation, replication stress, and topoisom-
erase poisons such as etoposide (reviewed by Miyamoto, 2011).
We find that etoposide treatment induces an NF-kB-depen-
dent innate immune response within hours of treatment, which
is particularly potent in human keratinocytes. This response
involves ATM and PARP-1, as well as the DNA sensing factors
IFI16 and STING, but is independent of cGAS and cGAMP pro-
duction. Etoposide-induced DNA damage results in a non-ca-
nonical mode of STING activation, causing the assembly of an
alternative STING-containing signaling complex. This leads to
the predominant activation of NF-kB, rather than IRF3, and the
induction of an innate immune gene expression profile that
differs from that induced by cytosolic DNA sensing. We propose
that alternative modes of STING activation shape the innate
immune response, depending on the type of threat.
RESULTS
Etoposide-Induced DNA Damage Causes an Acute Cell-
Intrinsic Innate Immune Response in Human Cells
We tested the cell-intrinsic response to DNA damage in human
keratinocytes, which, in the outermost layer of our skin, are the
first point of contact for many pathogens and are exposed to
physical and chemical insults from sunlight or environmental
toxins. We find that following treatment with the topoisomerase
II poison etoposide, immortalized human HaCaT keratinocytes
induce an acute innate immune response that involves the
expression of IFN-b, the cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6), and the
chemokine CCL20 (Figures 1A–1C). mRNA induction was
apparent from 4 hr of treatment and peaking after 8–12 hr (Fig-
ures 1A–1C). We also detected the secretion of active type I
IFN (Figure 1D) and the subsequent induction of interferon-stim-
ulated genes such as IRF7 and IFI16 as a consequence of type I
IFN signaling (Figures S1A and S1B). Etoposide treatment also
caused the secretion of IL-6 protein (Figure 1E). The transcrip-
tional response to DNA damage correlated with the phosphory-
lation of histone gH2A.X (Figure 1F) and occurred at time points
at which etoposide treatment had not yet caused significant cell
death and only a small fraction of cells displayed early signs of
apoptosis by Annexin V staining (Figures 1G and S1C).
We detected a similar innate immune response to DNA dam-
age in primary normal human epidermal keratinocytes (NHEKs)
from adult donors, involving the expression of IFN-b, IL-6, and
CCL20 mRNA (Figures 1H, 1I, and S1D) and secretion of IL-6
protein (Figure 1J) at time points at which etoposide treatment
did not cause detectable amounts of cell death (Figure 1K). An
etoposide-induced innate immune response was also detect-
able in other cell types, even though the response was more
modest in MRC-5 primary human embryonic fibroblasts (Figures
1L, 1M, and S1E–S1G) and started at later time points, after
24–36 hr, in human THP1 monocytes, whether or not they had
been differentiated using phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate
(PMA) (Figures 1N, 1O, and S1H–S1L).
The Innate Immune Response to Etoposide-Induced
DNA Damage Involves the DNA Sensing Adaptor STING
We tested whether the DNA sensing adaptor STING is involved in
the acute innate immune response to etoposide-induced dou-
ble-strand breaks. HaCaT keratinocytes lacking STING still
expressed cGAS and IFI16, displayed unaltered gH2A.X phos-
phorylation (Figure 2A), and are able to survive as well as wild-
type cells after etoposide treatment (Figure 2B). However,
STING-deficient cell clones were unable to induce the transcrip-
tion of IFN-b mRNA after etoposide treatment (Figure 2C). As
expected, STING-deficient cells were also impaired in their
response to transfected DNA but supported IFN-b mRNA induc-
tion in response to the dsRNA mimic poly(I:C) (Figure 2C). The
lack of STING also impaired IL-6 mRNA expression and IL-6
protein secretion in response to etoposide treatment or DNA
transfection, but not following transfection with poly(I:C) (Figures
2D and 2E).
Despite the involvement of STING in both the response to
exogenous DNA and the response to DNA damage, the pattern
of innate immune gene induction differed between the two
stimuli. Etoposide treatment induced higher levels of IL-6 and
CCL20 mRNA and lower levels of the chemokine CXCL10 and
the IRF3-responsive gene ISG56 than DNA transfection under

 conditions for which IFN-b mRNA induction is comparable (Fig-
ures 2C, 2D, and S2A–S2C). Transcription factor activation pro-
files also differed between the two responses, with the response
to DNA damage involving prominent nuclear translocation of the
NF-kB subunit p65 and only modest activation of IRF3 (Figures
S2D–S2G). We used a PCR array to quantify the expression of
more than 80 cytokines and chemokines in HaCaT cells treated
with etoposide or transfected DNA for 4 hr. We found that even
though the two stimuli induced different cytokine expression
profiles, both responses were STING dependent (Figure 2F).
The STING-dependent response to etoposide included the
expression of genes such as CCL20, which is not strongly
induced by conventional DNA-induced STING signaling (Figures
2F, S2C, and S3A). HaCaT cells lacking STING were also unable
to support etoposide-induced NF-kB p65 nuclear translocation
or phosphorylation (Figures 2G, 2H, and S3B), as well as TBK1
and
IRF3
phosphorylation
induced

(Figure S3B).
We confirmed the requirement for STING in the innate immune
response to double-strand breaks using RNAi in primary
NHEKs (Figures 2I, 2J, and S3C), in MRC-5 fibroblasts (Figures
2K, S3D, and S3E), and in THP1 cells lacking STING (Figures
2L and S3F). We conclude that the acute innate immune
response to etoposide-induced double-strand breaks involves
the STING-mediated activation of NF-kB p65 and the induction
of a non-canonical STING-dependent innate immune gene
expression program.
IFI16 Is Required for the Etoposide-Induced Innate
Immune Response
IFI16 is a DNA binding protein that cooperates with cGAS in the
detection of cytosolic DNA in human keratinocytes and macro-
phages (Almine et al., 2017; Jønsson et al., 2017). IFI16 has also
been described as a tumor suppressor protein, which associates
with DNA damage factors such as BRCA1 and p53 and acts to
promote cellular senescence (Aglipay et al., 2003; Clarke et al.,
2010; Johnstone et al., 2000). Due to its predominantly nuclear
localization, we hypothesized that IFI16 may be a good candidate
to provide a link betweenDNA damage and innateimmunity when
the cell’s own damaged DNA may be sensed as a DAMP.
IFI16-deficient HaCaT cells were able to support gH2A.X
phosphorylation after etoposide treatment (Figure 3A) and
displayed a survival advantage over wild-type cells in clonogenic
survival assays (Figure S3G). Like STING-deficient cells, two in-
dependent HaCaT cell clones lacking IFI16 were unable to
induce the expression of IFN-b mRNA after etoposide treatment
(Figure 3B). As observed previously (Almine et al., 2017), the
response to exogenous DNA was also reduced in cells lacking
IFI16, while poly(I:C)-induced IFN-b mRNA expression was
unaffected (Figure 3B). The etoposide-induced secretion of
bio-active type I interferons was also impaired in cells lacking
IFI16 (Figure S3H), as was the expression of IL-6 mRNA, the
secretion of IL-6 protein, and the expression of CCL20 mRNA
(Figures 3C–3E). IFI16 was also required for the phosphorylation
and nuclear translocation of NF-kB following etoposide treat-
ment (Figures 3F–3H).
We confirmed the involvement of IFI16 in the DNA damage-
induced innate immune response by reconstituting IFI16�/�
HaCaT cells with lentivirus for the inducible expression of
IFI16 or Luciferase as control. IFI16 re-expression rescued
DNA damage-induced IFN-b expression (Figures 3I and 3J).
The role of IFI16 was confirmed in MRC-5 fibroblasts (Figures
3K–3M and S3I) and in primary NHEKs (Figures S3J–S3L) using
RNAi.
The Acute Innate Immune Response to Etoposide-
Induced Damage Is Independent of cGAS and cGAMP
Because IFI16 cooperates with cGAS in the activation of STING,
we tested whether cGAS was also required for the early innate
immune response following etoposide treatment. cGAS-defi-
cient HaCaT cell clones were still able to support gH2A.X phos-
phorylation after etoposide treatment (Figure 4A). However, in
contrast to the data obtained with IFI16- or STING-deficient
cells, cGAS was dispensable for IFN-b mRNA induction after
etoposide treatment, even though cGAS was essential for
IFN-b expression after DNA transfection, as expected (Fig-
ure 4B). cGAS was also dispensable for the induction of IL-6
and CCL20 mRNA after etoposide treatment (Figures 4C and
S4A) and the secretion of IL-6 protein measured by ELISA
(Figure 4D).

Molecular Cell 71, 745–760, September 6, 2018
 To exclude potential off-target effects or compensatory mech-
anisms that may have arisen during the generation of cGAS-defi-
cient cell clones, we confirmed the differential roles of cGAS
using RNAi in HaCaT keratinocytes (Figure S4B) and in MRC-5
fibroblasts (Figures 4E and 4F). Etoposide-induced IFN-b
mRNA expression was impaired in IFI16-deficient THP1 cells,
but not cGAS-deficient THP1 cells (Figure 4G), while the
response to transfected DNA required the cooperation of both
proteins, as described (Jønsson et al., 2017). In agreement
with the gene expression data, the absence of cGAS did not
affect etoposide-induced NF-kB p65 translocation to the nu-
cleus (Figures 4H and 4I).
Non-conventional STING Activation after DNA Damage
During the detection of cytosolic DNA, STING is activated by
binding the second messenger cGAMP, which causes a confor-
mational change in the STING dimer (Gao et al., 2013). Given that
cGAS was not required for the early innate immune response to
DNA damage, we tested the possibility that another enzyme in
the cell may substitute for cGAS function. We measured the pro-
duction of endogenous cGAMP in HaCaT cells using a liquid
chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) approach, which
allowed us to specifically quantify cGAMP, using c-di-AMP as
spike-in control to account for variations arising from sample
processing (Figures S4C and S4D). Unlike DNA transfection,
Etoposide treatment did not cause any increase in cGAMP pro-
duction above basal levels (Figures 4J and S4E). This demon-
strates that the function of STING during the response to nuclear
DNA damage involves its non-canonical activation in a cGAS-
and cGAMP-independent manner.
During conventional DNA sensing, STING translocates from
the ER to peri-nuclear foci and gets phosphorylated by TBK1
at Serine 366 (Dobbs et al., 2015; Liu et al., 2015). Etoposide
treatment did not cause any detectable STING phosphorylation
(Figure S5A) or STING translocation to characteristic foci (Fig-
ure 5A). To test whether STING translocation is dispensable or
whether some low level of translocation occurs, which is not
apparent by confocal microscopy, we inhibited STING translo-
cation using brefeldin A (Figure 5A). Pre-treatment with brefeldin
A inhibited the expression of IFN-b in response to both etoposide
treatment and DNA transfection (Figure 5B). However, although
IL-6 mRNA expression after DNA transfection also required
STING trafficking, trafficking was not required for DNA dam-
age-induced IL-6 expression (Figure 5C). Similar results were
obtained with a TBK1 inhibitor (Clark et al., 2009), which impaired
etoposide-induced IFN-b mRNA expression, but not IL-6
expression (Figures 5D and 5E), while both IFN-b and IL-6
mRNA expression were TBK1 dependent in response to cyto-
solic DNA, as described (Abe and Barber, 2014). TBK1 function
was also dispensable for the etoposide-induced nuclear translo-
cation of NF-kB p65 (Figures 5F and S5B). This suggests that low
levels of STING trafficking and TBK1 activation must occur after
etoposide-induced damage and contribute to the induction of
IFN-b mRNA under these conditions. The expression of NF-
kB-dependent genes such as IL-6, however, proceeds indepen-
dently of STING trafficking and TBK1 activity.
The DNA Damage Factors ATM and PARP-1 Are
Required for the Innate Immune Response to Double-
Strand Breaks
The early activation of NF-kB in response to double-strand breaks
has been shown to involve the DNA damage kinase ATM and
PARP-1 (Hinz et al., 2010; Miyamoto, 2011; Stilmann et al.,
2009; Wu et al., 2010). Thus, we tested whether these factors
are also involved in the STING-dependent innate immune
response to DNA damage that we observe in human keratino-
cytes. We found that inhibition of ATM impaired the expression
of IFN-b and IL-6 mRNA after DNA damage and the secretion of
IL-6 protein in HaCaT keratinocytes (Figures 5G–5I). ATM activity
was not required for the induction of IFN-b and IL-6 following DNA
transfection (Figures 5G–5I), highlighting the differences between
these two STING-dependent responses. ATM was also required
for the nuclear translocation of NF-kB p65 (Figures 4J and S5C)
and p65 phosphorylation after etoposide treatment (Figure S5D).
A role for ATM was confirmed in NHEK (Figures 5K, S5E, and S5F)
and in MRC-5 fibroblasts (Figures S5G–S5I). Like ATM, PARP-1
was also specifically required for the induction of IFN-b and IL-6
expression in response to nuclear DNA damage but was dispens-
able for the detection of cytosolic DNA (Figures 5L and S5J).

Complex Containing STING

 in the cytosol (Miyamoto, 2011). ATM also phosphorylates p53,
which has been shown to interact with IFI16 (Liao et al., 2011).
To investigate whether non-canonical activation of STING in-
volves these factors, we interrogated STING complex assembly
using immunoprecipitation of endogenous STING in etoposide-
treated HaCaT cells. We found that the interaction between
IFI16 and STING increased transiently after etoposide treatment
and p53 and TRAF6 assemble on STING within 30 min and 1 hr of
etoposide treatment, respectively (Figure 6A). This complex is
specifically induced by DNA damage and does not form when
STING is activated by DNA transfection (Figure 6B). Complex
formation requires the function of both PARP-1 and ATM (Fig-
ures 6C and 6D). The DNA damage-induced STING complex
likely forms at the ER where STING resides, because p53,
IFI16, and TRAF6 all shuttle between nucleus and cytosol and
become enriched in the membrane fraction of cells after etopo-
side treatment (Figure S6A).
Both IFI16 and p53 assemble on STING soon after etoposide
treatment, and interaction between p53 and IFI16 has been
shown to be direct (Liao et al., 2011). Using IFI16-deficient
HaCaT cells, we observed that IFI16 was required for the recruit-
ment of p53 to STING (Figure 6E), while the absence of STING
still permitted the IFI16-p53 interaction (Figure 6F). This suggests
that IFI16 forms a complex with p53 and delivers it to STING after
DNA damage, in a manner that depends on ATM activity. ATM
phosphorylates p53 at several residues, including Serine 15
(Ser15), which results in the activation of p53 (Banin et al.,
1998; Canman et al., 1998). To assess the role of p53 Ser15
phosphorylation in complex assembly, we co-expressed IFI16
and p53 in HEK293T cells, using wild-type p53 or an alanine
mutant at position 15 (15A), which cannot be phosphorylated,
or using a mutant for which Ser15 is substituted with aspartate
(15D), which acts as a phospho-mimic (Loughery et al., 2014).
Only wild-type p53 and the 15D phospho-mimic were able to
interact with IFI16; the 15A mutant was unable to do so (Fig-
ure 6G). A similar pattern was observed for the interaction
between p53 and STING (Figure S6B), demonstrating that p53
phosphorylation
at
Ser15
is
a
requirement
for
complex
formation.
This association of p53 to the STING complex was functionally
important for the innate immune response to DNA damage,
because p53 depletion by small interfering RNA (siRNA)
impaired the expression of IL-6, IFN-b, and CCL20 in HaCaT
keratinocytes (Figures 6H, 6I, S6C, and S6D). HaCaT cells are
spontaneously immortalized and express mutated forms of
p53, which are partially functional, but may also have acquired
additional functions (Boukamp et al., 1988; Lehman et al.,
1993). Thus, we tested p53 function in primary human MRC-5
fibroblasts that express wild-type p53. We found a similar p53
dependence of etoposide-induced IFN-b expression in fibro-
blasts (Figures S6E and S6F). Altogether, our data show that
phosphorylation of p53 at Ser15 likely provides a link between
ATM activity and assembly of a STING-containing innate im-
mune signaling complex.
TRAF6 Mediates STING-Dependent NF-kB Activation
after DNA Damage
We next investigated the role of TRAF6 in the STING complex.
We found that TRAF6 transiently interacted with IFI16 in etopo-
side-treated HaCaT cells, and IFI16 was required for the etopo-
side-induced recruitment of TRAF6 to the STING complex
(Figure 7A). TRAF6 has an important function in this response,
because two TRAF6-deficient HaCaT cell clones were able to
support gH2A.X phosphorylation after etoposide treatment (Fig-
ure 7B) but were impaired in their ability to induce IL-6, IFN-b,
and CCL20 mRNA after DNA damage, while the response to
exogenous DNA was unaffected (Figures 7C, 7D, and S7A).
TRAF6 is a component of many innate immune signaling com-
plexes, where it catalyzes the formation of K63-linked ubiquitin
chains, which then mediate the recruitment of TAB2/3 and
TAK1, leading to activation of the IKK complex and phosphory-
lation of NF-kB p65 (Walsh et al., 2015). We also observe
TRAF6-dependent TAK1 and p65 phosphorylation after DNA
damage (Figure 7E). Inhibition of the E2 enzyme Ubc13, which
works with TRAF6 to catalyze K63-linked ubiquitin chain forma-
tion, impaired the etoposide-induced expression of IL-6, IFN-b,
and CCL20 (Figures 7F, S7B, and S7C), showing that the assem-
bly of K63-linked ubiquitin chains is an important feature of this
response.
TRAF6, but not TRAF2 or TRAF3, was able to cause the
assembly of ubiquitin chains on a STING complex when overex-
pressed (Figure S7D), and this function was enhanced in the
Figure 4. cGAS Is Dispensable for the Early Innate Immune Response to Nuclear DNA Damage

 presence of IFI16 (Figure 7G). The TRAF6-dependent K63-linked
ubiquitylation of endogenous STING could be observed in
HaCaT cells within 1 hr of etoposide treatment (Figure 7H), and
unmodified STING transiently associated with a complex con-
taining K63-linked ubiquitin chains in a TRAF6-dependent
manner (Figure 7H). We conclude that the IFI16-mediated
recruitment of TRAF6 to a DNA damage-induced STING com-
plex leads to the assembly of K63-linked ubiquitin chains on
STING, promoting the activation of NF-kB after nuclear DNA
damage.
DISCUSSION
In this work, we describe a non-canonical mode of STING activa-
tion, which results in the induction of an acute innate immune
response within hours of etoposide-induced damage. This cell-
intrinsic response is distinct from the delayed response due to
the detection of DNA from cytosolic micronuclei, which involves
cGAS and STING (Dou et al., 2017; Gl€
uck et al., 2017; Harding
et al., 2017; Mackenzie et al., 2017). The early response to dou-
ble-strand breaks appears to be particularly potent in keratino-
cytes, where it might serve as an early warning system for DNA
damage induced by UV light or environmental toxins or for the
presence of nuclear DNA viruses, which may also be detected
by the DNA damage machinery (Turnell and Grand, 2012).
A role for DNA damage factors and particularly p53 in anti-viral
defense and innate immunity has been proposed, because p53
is responsive to type I interferons, can act as a restriction factor
for viruses and transposons, and is in turn targeted by multiple
viral evasion mechanisms (Levine et al., 2016; Miciak and
Bunz, 2016; Mun
˜ oz-Fontela et al., 2016). Here, we link p53 acti-
vation to innate immunity, with the ATM-mediated phosphoryla-
tion of p53 at Ser15 being required for the association of p53 with
a STING-containing signaling complex. Because cooperation
between p53 and p65 in the transactivation of innate immune
genes, including IL-6 and CCL20, has been observed (Lowe
et al., 2014), it remains to be investigated whether p53 acts as
a transcription factor and/or has a role in NF-kB activation during
the transcriptional response to etoposide.
We show that ATM, PARP-1, and IFI16 are important in the as-
sembly of the DNA damage-induced STING complex. This raises
important questions about the nature of the stimulus that drives
STING activation after the recognition of double-strand breaks.
Althoughthemolecularmechanismofdouble-strandbreakrecog-
nition by ATM and the subsequent phosphorylation of p53 provide
a molecular link between DNA damage and complex formation, it
isunknownwhetherIFI16isalsoinvolvedintherecognitionofDNA
damage or replication stress in the nucleus. It is conceivable that
IFI16’s ability to bind unchromatinized (naked) stretches of dsDNA
(Morrone et al., 2014; Stratmann et al., 2015) may contribute to the
recognition of damaged DNA in the nucleus and provide a further
DNA damage signal to activate STING.
The cGAS-independent activation of STING that we observe
after etoposide-induced damage appears to proceed largely in
the absence of the hallmarks of canonical STING activation:
we do not detect STING phosphorylation at Serine 366 or trans-
location to peri-nuclear foci. However, low levels of STING traf-
ficking and TBK1 activation probably occur and are important
for the expression of IFN-b after etoposide treatment, possibly
through the low-level activation of IRF3, which is required for
the transactivation of the IFN-b promoter. The expression of
NF-kB-dependent genes such as IL-6, however, can proceed
in the absence of STING trafficking and TBK1 function, high-
lighting that STING undergoes a qualitatively different mode of
activation under these circumstances.
We find that although both DNA damage and DNA transfection
activate IFN-b induction, the pattern of transcription factor acti-
vation differs markedly, with etoposide treatment showing a
greater extent of NF-kB activation than cytosolic DNA sensing,
which predominantly activates IRF3. Hence, both treatments
result in only partially overlapping patterns of STING-dependent
gene induction. After DNA damage, STING-dependent NF-kB
p65 activation is accomplished through the recruitment of the
E3 ubiquitin ligase TRAF6. We provide evidence that TRAF6
catalyzes the assembly of K63-linked ubiquitin chains on STING,
a function that is promoted by IFI16. Although TRAF6 also has
ubiquitin ligase-independent roles in innate immune signaling
(Strickson et al., 2017), it is likely that the assembly of K63-linked
poly-ubiquitin chains on STING causes the recruitment of TAB2/
3, TAK1, NEMO, and IKKa/b, in analogy to its role in NF-kB acti-
vation in other innate immune signaling cascades (Walsh
et al., 2015).

 The intense study of STING in DNA sensing has shown that
STING is subject to a multitude of post-translational modifica-
tions, including modification with K63-, K48-, K27-, and K11-
linked ubiquitin chains (Chiang and Gack, 2017; Hu et al.,
2016; Mukai et al., 2016). The precise molecular function of
these modifications in the regulation of STING function has
not yet been elucidated, but it is clear that several post-transla-
tional modifications of STING act together to fine-tune STING
activity and allow for an appropriate and transient response.
Any emerging alternative modes of STING activation are likely
to be regulated by a similarly complex network of STING inter-

tions that act in a stimulus- and time-dependent
manner.
Studies show that the DNA damage-induced
activation of NF-kB is only one example of novel
downstream signaling responses that can be acti-
vated by STING. It has been shown that in addition
to its now well-defined role in the IFN response,
STING can promote autophagy (Watson et al.,
2012, 2015), apoptosis (Gulen et al., 2017), ER
stress (Moretti et al., 2017), and potassium efflux
leading to NLRP3-mediated inflammasome acti-
vation (Gaidt et al., 2017). Although most signaling
functions of STING involve cGAS and cGAMP, in-
stances of cGAS-independent STING signaling
have been described, for instance, after the recog-
nition of viral membrane fusion (Holm et al., 2016)
and after recognition of RNA ligands by RIG-I and
MDA5 (Franz et al., 2018). The activation of STING by RIG-I-like
receptors (RLRs) induces yet another downstream response in
limiting the translation of viral mRNAs that, like the response to
DNA damage, occurs in the absence of detectable STING trans-
location and phosphorylation (Franz et al., 2018). It remains to be
determined how STING is activated under these conditions and
how the mode of STING activation mediates the choice of one
STING-dependent signaling pathway over another. Our work
provides evidence for the notion that STING is not solely an
adaptor in the cytosolic DNA sensing response but rather acts
a signaling hub that integrates input signals from several sensors

EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND SUBJECT DETAILS
Cell culture
Immortalized human HaCaT keratinocytes, primary MRC-5 human fibroblasts and HEK293T cells were grown in DMEM (Life Tech-
nologies) supplemented with 10% Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS; Sigma) and 50mg/mL Gentamycin (Life Technologies). Primary normal
human dermal keratinocytes from adult donors (NHEK; Lonza) were grown in KGM-Gold Keratinocyte Basal Medium supplemented
with KGM-Gold SingleQuots (Lonza). THP1 cells were grown in RPMI 1640 (Life Technologies) supplemented with 10% FBS and
50 mg/mL Gentamycin, and differentiated with 100nM PMA for 24h where indicated.
THP1 cells lacking STING, IFI16 or cGAS were generated using CRISPR/Cas9 (Jønsson et al., 2017). HaCaT cell clones lacking
TRAF6 were generated using Cas9 nickase (Strickson et al., 2017). IFI16�/� HaCaT cells were generated using TALENs as described
(Almine et al., 2017). HaCaT cells lacking cGAS or STING were generated using CRISPR-Cas9 nickase. Plasmids encoding Cas9
nickase and two guide RNAs, were transfected into HaCaT cells using the Neon transfection system (Life Technologies). Cells
were selected for 48h with Puromycin, and cell clones were generated by limiting dilution. Cell clones were screened for modifica-
tions of the target site, using high resolution melting analysis using LightCycler480 High Resolution Melting master mix (Roche) on a
LightCycler 96 system (Roche). Candidate clones were screened by western blotting and immunofluorescence.

 METHOD DETAILS
Plasmids and Transfection
HEK293T cells were transfected using 3mL of GeneJuice (Merck) per 1mg of plasmid DNA. p53 expression plasmids (wild-type, S15A
and S15D) were obtained from the David Meek lab, University of Dundee (Loughery et al., 2014). IFI16 expression plasmid was
generated by inserting the coding sequence from the IFI16 B isoform into pcDNA3.1. pcDNA3.1:STING-FLAG was kindly provided
by Lei Jin, Albany Medical Centre, the HA-ubiquitin expression construct by A. Mansell, Monash University, and TRAF6 expression
plasmids were obtained from Tularik, San Francisco. Transfection for stimulation of cells with exogenous nucleic acids were
performed using Lipofectamine 2000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific), using 1 mL Lipofectamine 2000 and 1 mg herring testis (HT) DNA
(Sigma) or 100ng poly(I:C) (Sigma) per mL of medium.
Luciferase- and IFI16-expressing lentiviruses derived from vector pLVX-TetOne-Puro (Clontech) were generated in HEK293T cells
as described (Harwardt et al., 2016). Lentiviruses were added to cell media with 8mg/mL Polybrene (Sigma) and incubated for 24h,
before addition of Puromycin (Sigma) selection medium. Lentiviral gene expression was activated by 24h incubation with 1mg/mL
Doxycycline (Sigma).
DNA Damaging Agents and Inhibitors
Etoposide and inhibitors were diluted in DMSO. Etoposide (Sigma) was used at a final concentration of 50 mM, unless indicated other-
wise. ATM inhibitor KU55933 (Santa Cruz) was used at 10 mM. TBK1 inhibitor MRT67307 was kindly provided by the MRC Protein
Phosphorylation and Ubiquitylation Unit, University of Dundee, and used at 2 mM. PARP inhibitor PJ34 (Sigma) was used at
10mM. Brefeldin A (eBioscience) was used at 3mg/mL. Ubc13 inhibitor NSC697923 (Sigma) was used at 1 and 10 mM as indicated.
siRNAs
Pools of four individual siRNAs were obtained from GE Dharmacon (SMARTpool: ON-TARGETplus siRNA). Cells were transfected
with 3 mL Lipofectamine RNAiMax (Thermo Fisher Scientific) per mL medium and 5nM of non-targeting siRNA pool or IFI16-,
STING-, or p53-targeting siRNA for 48h before stimulation of cells.
qRT-PCR
RNA was extracted from cells using the EZNA total RNA kit (Omega Bio-TEK), treated with DNase I (Thermo Scientific), and reverse
transcribed using the iScript cDNA Synthesis Kit (Bio-Rad Laboratories) according to manufacturer’s instructions. PCR primers were
synthesized by Eurofins Genomics, for sequences see Table S1. qRT-PCR amplification was carried out using FastStart Universal
SYBR Green master mix (Roche) on a LightCycler 96 realtime PCR instrument (Roche). The cycling program was as follows: initial
denaturation at 95�C for 600 s; 40 cycles of 95�C for 10 s and 60�C for 30 s; followed by a melt curve step. Quantification cycle
(Cq) for the mRNAs of interest were normalized to b-actin reference mRNA and data was expressed as fold change over mock
treatment.
For the qRT-PCR array, cDNA was prepared using RT2 First Strand Mix (QIAGEN), and amplified using RT2 SYBR Green qPCR
Master Mix (QIAGEN) with the RT2 Profiler PCR Array Human Cytokines and Chemokines (PAHS-150ZF, QIAGEN), according to
manufacturer’s instructions. Data was analyzed using SABioscience PCR array analysis software.
ELISA and IFN Bio-assay
Secreted interleukin-6 (IL-6) protein in cell supernatants was quantified using the Human IL-6 DuoSet ELISA (R&D Systems) accord-
ing to manufacturer’s instructions. Results were expressed as pg/mL IL-6 protein in supernatants, based on a standard curve from
recombinant IL-6 standards. Bio-active type I IFN in cell supernatants was measured using an IFN bioassay utilizing HEK293 cells
stably expressing a pGreenFire-ISRE construct (kindly provided by Jan Rehwinkel). Reporter cells were overlaid with sample cell
culture supernatant for 24h, and luminescence was measured using One-Glo Luciferase Assay System (Promega) according to
manufacturer’s instructions.
Immunoblotting
Cells were lysed in Mammalian Cell Lysis Buffer (50mM Tris-Cl pH 7.5, 1mM EDTA, 1mM EGTA, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 1mM sodium
orthovanadate, 50mM sodium fluoride, 5mM sodium pyrophosphate, 10mM sodium b-glycerophosphate, 0.27M sucrose, 0.1% (v/v)
2-mercaptoethanol, 0.1mM PMSF, 10 ml/ml Aprotinin) and pre-cleared by centrifugation at 8,000xg for 10 min. In the fractionation
experiments, subcellular fractions were separated using the Cell Fractionation kit (Cell Signaling) according to manufacturer’s
instructions. Pre-cleared lysates were denatured by boiling in SDS sample buffer (62.5mM Tris-Cl pH 6.8, 2% (w/v) SDS, 10%
Glycerol, 0.1% Bromophenol Blue, 50mM DTT). Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto PVDF membranes
(Millipore) using semi-dry transfer (Biometra). Membranes were blocked with 5% (w/v) non-fat milk, or 5% bovine serum albumin
(BSA), in 0.1% Tween-20/TBS for 1h. Primary antibodies were used at a dilution of 1:1000. Secondary HRP-coupled antibodies
were used at 1:3000. Membranes were developed using Clarity or Clarity Max ECL substrate (Bio-Rad) and imaged on a Chemidoc
(Bio-Rad) or Odyssey (LI-COR) imaging system.

Molecular Cell 71, 745–760.e1–e5, September 6, 2018
 Co-Immunoprecipitation
Cells were lysed in Mammalian Cell Lysis Buffer (50mM Tris-Cl pH 7.5, 1mM EDTA, 1mM EGTA, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 1mM sodium
orthovanadate, 50mM sodium fluoride, 5mM sodium pyrophosphate, 10mM sodium b-glycerophosphate, 0.27M sucrose, 0.1% (v/v)
2-mercaptoethanol, 0.1mM PMSF, 10 mL/mL Aprotinin). For the immunoprecipitation of ubiquitin chains, the lysis buffer was supple-
mented with 50mM iodoacetamide (Sigma). Samples were pre-cleared by centrifugation at 8,000xg for 10 min before incubation with
1 mL of antibodies overnight at 4�C, followed by the addition of a 30 mL protein G beads (Thermo Fisher) for 3h at 4�C. Beads were
washed three times with lysis buffer and bound proteins were eluted by boiling in SDS sample buffer for 10 min. A portion of each
whole cell lysate was retained as input controls.
Confocal Microscopy
For staining of NF-kB p65, cells grown on glass coverslips were fixed for 15 min in 4% paraformaldehyde, and permeabilised for
12 min in 0.5% Triton X-100/PBS. Coverslips were incubated in blocking buffer (5% BSA in 0.05% Tween-20/PBS) for 1h, and stained
overnight with primary antibodies (1:600), washed with PBS, and incubated with fluorescently labeled secondary antibodies (1:1500)
for 3h. For visualization of STING, cells were fixed in methanol at �20�C, permeabilised, and incubated with blocking buffer
containing 5% FBS in 0.05% Tween-20/PBS before incubation with antibodies as above. Coverslips were mounted in MOWIOL
4-88 (Calbiochem) containing 1 mg/mL DAPI (Sigma). Images were taken on a Zeiss LSM880 confocal microscope.
Cytotoxicity Assays
Cells were seeded in 96 well plates and treated as indicated. Cyanine Dye and Assay Buffer from CellTox Green Cytotoxicity Assay
(Promega) were incubated with cells for 15 min after treatment. Fluorescence was measured using the Infinite M200 PRO (Tecan)
plate reader at wavelengths of 485-500nmEx/520-530nmEm.
Cells undergoing apoptosis were quantified using the Annexin V apoptosis detection kit (eBioscience). Cells were treated with
Etoposide for the indicated times, then washed and stained with Annexin V and Propidium Iodide according to manufacturer’s
instructions. Cells were analyzed by flow cytometry (Cytoflex, Beckman Coulter).
Clonogenic Survival Assay
Cells were seeded in 6 well plates and allowed to attach prior to treatment with indicated concentrations of Etoposide. Media was
changed after 24 h, and cells were allowed to grow for for a further 14 days. Cells were then washed, fixed, and stained with Giemsa
stain (Sigma). The number of colonies containing > 50 cells was counted. Cell viability of untreated cells was treated as 100%.
cGAMP Detection by LC-MS
cGAMP detection was carried out as described in Almine et al., 2017. Cells were lysed in cold 80% methanol, and an internal
standard of 0.45pmol cyclic di-AMP was added to each sample. Samples then underwent three rounds of butanol:water extraction.
Dried samples were resuspended in 1mL H2O and purified by solid phase extraction using HyperSep Aminopropyl columns (Thermo
Scientific). Columns were washed twice with 2% (v/v) acetic acid and 80% (v/v) methanol. Elution was performed using 4% (v/v)
ammonium hydroxide and 80% (v/v) methanol. Samples were resuspended in 50 mL H2O for analysis. cGAMP levels were measured
by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS) using a TSQ Quantiva interfaced with Ultimate 3000 Liquid Chromatography
system (Thermo Scientific), equipped with a porous graphitic carbon column (HyperCarb 30x1mm ID 3 mm; Part No: C-35003-
031030, Thermo-Scientific). cGAMP and cyclic di-AMP levels were measured using multiple reaction monitoring mode (MRM)
with optimized collision energies. Three transitions (328.03, 343.92 and 522.00) were used to monitor cGAMP and one transition
(328.03) was used to detect cyclic di-AMP.
QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Quantitative data are expressed as mean of biological triplicate samples ± SD. Data were subjected to a multiple t test statistical
analysis with the Holm-Sidak method. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001, as indicated in the figure legends.
