The known Models for providing residential care are changing
around the world, with increasing emphasis on care in home-
like environments. Large residential aged care facilities are still
typical in Australia.
The new A clustered, domestic model of residential aged care
was associated with fewer hospitalisations and emergency
department presentations and higher quality of life for
residents, without increasing whole of system costs.
The implications Smaller scale, clustered domestic models of
care may better meet the preferences of residents and their
families, and also improve health and quality of life outcomes
for older people, at similar or lower costs.
C
aring for people living in residential aged care facilities
(RACFs)
costs
the
Australian
government
about
$11.5 billion each year.1 It is estimated that half the resi-
dents in RACFs have dementia, and ensuring that these vulner-
able residents receive high quality care is complex.2 The aged care
system in Australia is currently undergoing reform to ensure that
it “offers choice and flexibility for consumers”.3
In 2010e11, 54% of RACFs in major Australian cities had more
than 60 residential places, and the average facility size is
growing.4,5 However, it is increasingly recognised that the well-
being of residents and their ability to live in a self-determined
manner need to be maximised.6,7 Ideally, the RACF should feel
more like a home than a health care facility. Models of care have
been proposed that include smaller living units designed to look
and feel like homes, with staffing models and physical design that
support greater resident choice in routines, as well as flexibility of
activities and outdoor access.8,9 In these models, the staff and
residents often contribute to domestic duties, simulating a home-
like environment and lifestyle.6,10 The World Health Organiza-
tion has indicated that such models of care have advantages for
older people, families, volunteers and care workers, and also
improve the quality of care.7
Small, clustered domestic models of care are reported to perform
well on standard quality of care indicators, such as numbers of re-
hospitalisations, catheter use, and pressure ulcers.8 These models
may also provide benefits in terms of quality of life, activities of
daily living, and behavioural symptoms in residents with de-
mentia.6 However, the available evidence is limited and further
investigation, including evaluation of costs, is needed.6
Our cross-sectional study is the first to examine resident quality of
life and resource use associated with a clustered domestic model of
care in Australia. We also estimated the costs associated with a
clustered domestic model of care and compared them with those
for standard Australian models of residential aged care.
Methods
Participants
The Investigating Services Provided in the Residential Care Envi-
ronment for Dementia (INSPIRED) study is a cross-sectional
investigation of the quality of life and health service use asso-
ciated
with
different
RACF
models
in
Australia.
RACFs
providing different models of care and catering to residents with a
high prevalence of cognitive impairment and dementia were pur-
posefully sampled for this study; our methods have been described
in detail elsewhere.11,12 Data were collected between January 2015
and February 2016 from residents of 17 not-for-profit RACFs in
Abstract
Objective: To compare the outcomes and costs of clustered
domestic and standard Australian models of residential aged care.
Design: Cross-sectional retrospective analysis of linked health
service data, January 2015 e February 2016.
Setting: 17 aged care facilities in four Australian states providing
clustered (four) or standard Australian (13) models of residential
aged care.
Participants: People with or without cognitive impairment
residing in a residential aged care facility (RACF) for at least
12 months, not in palliative care, with a family member willing to
participate on their behalf if required. 901 residents were eligible;
541 consented to participation (24% self-consent, 76% proxy
consent).
Main outcome measures: Quality of life (measured with EQ-
5D-5L); medical service use; health and residential care costs.
Results: After adjusting for patient- and facility-level factors,
individuals residing in clustered models of care had better quality
of life (adjusted mean EQ-5D-5L score difference, 0.107; 95% CI,
0.028e0.186; P ¼ 0.008), lower hospitalisation rates (adjusted
rate ratio, 0.32; 95% CI, 0.13e0.79; P ¼ 0.010), and lower
emergency department presentation rates (adjusted rate ratio,
0.27; 95% CI, 0.14e0.53; P < 0.001) than residents of standard
care facilities. Unadjusted facility running costs were similar for
the two models, but, after adjusting for resident- and facility-
related factors, it was estimated that overall there is a saving of
$12 962 (2016 values; 95% CI, $11 092e14 831) per person per
year in residential care costs.
Conclusions: Clustered domestic models of residential care are
associated with better quality of life and fewer hospitalisations
for residents, without increasing whole of system costs.

 New South Wales (five), Queensland (two), South Australia
(seven), and Western Australia (three) who agreed to participate;
no for-profit providers agreed to participation. Residents were
eligible for inclusion if they had been a permanent resident in the
RACF for at least 12 months, were not in immediate palliative care,
had no complex medical or family problems that would impede
participation, and had a family member willing to participate on
their behalf if required.
Data collection
Data on demographic characteristics, health, physical and
cognitive function, behaviour, and quality of life were collected
from facility records and questionnaires filled by participants,
their proxies (family or friends), or carers. The EuroQol EQ-5D-5L
scale,13 a tool for measuring health-related quality of life, was
completed by each participant (when possible) or by their
representative. Self-completion was encouraged for participants
with a Psychogeriatric Assessment Scales e Cognitive Impair-
ment Scale (PAS-Cog) score of 11 or less. Quality of life was also
assessed with a dementia-specific tool, the DEMQOL (for those
who could complete it themselves) and DEMQOL-Proxy. The
tools and the DEMQOL results are discussed in detail in online
Appendix 1.
RACF revenues and expenditures for the financial years 2013e14
and 2014e15, as well as operative costs, were collected using a
survey based on the StewartBrown Aged Care Financial Perfor-
mance Survey.14 Health care use data for the 12 months prior to
data collection were obtained from federal and state data custo-
dians and linked to individual data.
Models of residential aged care
Facilities providing a clustered domestic model of care met at least
five of the following criteria: small living units (15 or fewer resi-
dents), independently accessible outdoor areas, allocation of care
staff to specific living units, meals cooked in the units, self-service of
meals by residents, and residents’ participation in meal preparation.
While several other factors also characterise clustered domestic
modelsofcare,classificationaccordingtothesesixcriteriawasbased
onearlierresearch9,15-17andconsultationswithanadvisorygroupof
consumer representatives, clinicians, researchers, and care pro-
viders. Facilities that did not meet at least five criteria were defined
as providing a standard Australian model of care; no standard care
facilities satisfied more than two of the criteria.
Costs estimation
Health care and RACF costs were estimated from a broad
perspective according to Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Com-
mittee guidelines.18 All health care costs (except for pharmaceuti-
cals) were calculated according to health care use data from federal
and state data custodians. Detailed health care costing methodol-
ogy has been described elsewhere,11,12 and is summarised in online
Appendix 2.
RACF resource use and costs were collected at the facility level and
converted to the cost per resident per year with the formula:
Annual facility cost
Total number of beds � Average occupancy rate
The annual total health care and residential care costs comprised
the sum of the individual health care unit costs for each participant
and the residential care costs. Private health insurance and capital
establishment costs were not captured.
The cost to government included only costs paid directly by state or
federal governments or their agencies (eg, Department of Veterans’
Affairs). Additional details are provided in online Appendix 2.
Statistical analysis
In the economic analysis, we evaluated the differences in costs and
resource use (including health service use) between the two models
of care in multilevel random effect linear models, with adjustment
for confounding by individual-level characteristics — age, sex,
marital status, cognitive status (PAS-Cog), activities of daily living
(Barthel Index), comorbidities (CoheneMansfield Index), and
social interactions (with family and friends) — and facility-level
characteristics — geographic location, size of facility (number of
beds), investment in staff training, and number of direct care hours
(online Appendix 3).
In the main health care use analysis, we assumed that all datasets
from state and federal data custodians were complete. However,
proxy consent was not always accepted as valid consent by the data
custodians of Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS) and Pharmaceu-
tical Benefits Scheme (PBS) data; 16% of these data were conse-
quently missing (37% for clustered care, 10% for standard models
of care). As PBS data were used to estimate pharmaceutical use for
only 6% of participants, pharmaceutical data were missing for
1.5% of participants (online Appendix 2). MBS data were used to
estimate general practitioner consultation numbers and health care
costs. A complete data analysis of these outcomes was consistent
with the main analysis. Numbers of hospital separations, emer-
gency department presentations, GP consultations, and medica-
tions were modelled by random effect Poisson regressions.
A sample size of 500 participants was required to detect a differ-
ence between the two groups in quality of life, with an effect size of
0.3 (Cohen’s d) and 80% power. Adjusted means with confidence
intervals and model-generated P values are reported.
Ethics approval
This investigation was approved by the Flinders University Social
and Behavioural Research Ethics Committee (references, 6594,
6732, 6753) and by federal and state custodians of health care use
data: the federal Department of Human Services External Request
Evaluation Committee (references, M12830, MI3723, MI3520,
MI3522, MI4646), the Department of Veterans’ Affairs Human
Research Ethics Committee (reference, E015/014), the SA Depart-
ment for Health and Ageing Human Research Ethics Committee
(reference, SSA/16/SAH/29), the Department of Health WA
Human Research Ethics Committee (reference, 2015/59), the
Queensland Department of Health (reference, RD006096), and the
NSW Population and Health Services Research Ethics Committee
(reference, HREC/15/CIHS/35). Self-consent by patients to
participation was obtained when possible; for participants with
more severe cognitive impairment, proxy consent for participa-
tion was provided (usually by a close family member).
Results
Participant and facility characteristics
Of 1323 potential participants assessed for eligibility, 901 were
eligible and 541 (60%) provided consent (self-consent, 130 [24%];
proxy consent, 411 [76%]). Four of the 17 facilities provided a
clustered domestic model of care, all of which were designated
dementia-specific facilities and provided housing in units for 15 or

 fewer residents; all were operated by a single provider. Thirteen
RACFs provided a standard model of care (Box 1).
There were statistically significant differences between the models
of care with respect to age distribution of residents, frequency of
social interactions, number of comorbidities, proportions with
dementia diagnosis, and PAS-Cog scores (Box 2). All residents in a
clustered domestic model of care had a dementia diagnosis or a
PAS-Cog of 5 or more (indicative of cognitive impairment).
Outcomes
After adjusting for differences in individual and facility character-
istics, residing in a clustered domestic model of care was associated
with a significantly higher quality of life compared with residing in
a standard model of care (adjusted mean EQ-5D-5L difference,
0.107; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.028e0.186; P ¼ 0.008).
Further, the clustered model of care was associated with signifi-
cantly lower numbers of hospitalisations (adjusted rate ratio, 0.32;
95% CI, 0.13e0.79; P ¼ 0.010) and of emergency department pre-
sentations that did not lead to admission (adjusted rate ratio, 0.27;
95% CI, 0.14e0.53; P < 0.001) than standard care (Box 3).
Costs

 Discussion
Thisisthefirststudytoexaminethecosts,residentqualityoflife,and
numbers of hospitalisations associated with a clustered domestic
model of care in Australia.19,20 We found that a clustered domestic
model of care is associated with better quality of life for residents, as
well as fewer hospitalisations and emergency department pre-
sentations. These benefits were achieved without an increase in fa-
cility running costs. After adjusting for differences in the
populations and facilities, the proportion of the overall costs of the
clustered domestic model of care attributed to government was
lower than for the standard model, particularly for residential care.
We found that the difference in mean quality of life scores, after
adjusting for potential confounding factors, significantly favoured
residents in the clustered domestic model. Quality of life ratings by
proxies are often lower than self-ratings,21 and in our study the
proportion of proxy responses was higher in the clustered model
(95% v 66%); we may therefore have underestimated the difference
between the two models. Higher proxy-rated quality of life scores
on some dimensions have been reported for small scale group
homes in Japan, Belgium, and the Netherlands.22-24 A longitudinal
study of the American Green House model found better outcomes
on some dimensions of quality of life, and for quality of care,
resident satisfaction, emotional wellbeing, and change in func-
tional status.25 Other investigators have also reported better
quality of care outcomes on standard reporting measures for these
alternative models of care.6,8 However, no clear advantage in terms
of proxy-rated quality of life was found by smaller longitudinal
German and Dutch studies of small scale models of care.15,26
Our findings of similar or lower health care costs and of fewer
hospitalisations and emergency department presentations for
residents in the clustered domestic model are consistent with the
lower hospital re-admission rates and lower Medicare spending
per resident associated with the American Green House model.15,27
The lower hospitalisation rates for residents of clustered facilities
might be explained by differences in advanced care planning or
out-of-hospital health care services in these facilities. Hospital-
isations are associated with poor outcomes for residents and higher
costs to government.28 Increasing access to clustered domestic
residential care could therefore both benefit residents and reduce
government spending.
The observational nature of the INSPIRED study had both
strengths and limitations. Our study included a relatively large
sample of long term permanent residents of aged care facilities
with a high degree of cognitive impairment; the geographical
spread of facilities was broad (four Australian states, including
rural locations) and the primary data collection was comprehen-
sive (individual-, proxy- and facility-level characteristics; health
care resource use). Importantly, this study included a population
with a high prevalence of dementia, a population often excluded
from investigations. The costs approach we applied was based on
resource use by individual participants, using linked data from
federal and state health departments, and therefore provided a
conservative estimate of the relevant costs.11
However, the cross-sectional nature of the study means that con-
clusions about the causality of the associations reported cannot be
drawn. A randomised controlled trial investigating differences
between the two models of care at the facility level would not be
feasible. Further, the characteristics of the residents in the two
models of care were different; we therefore collected broad data on
baseline characteristics and used multilevel modelling to adjust for
potential confounding. As this study enrolled participants who
had resided in the care facilities for at least 12 months, our findings
reflect the costs and outcomes for survivors living in care long term.
Whether the advantages of residing in a clustered domestic model
apply to residents in care for less than 12 months or receiving
palliative care was not investigated. While the differences between
the residents included in our study and those who did not consent
to participation were not assessed, the sample was broadly repre-
sentative
of
individuals
living
permanently
in
RACFs
in
Australia.11
The clustered domestic facilities in this study were owned by a
single provider; whether the observed differences were attribut-
able to the infrastructure or staffing models of the provider rather
than the model of care cannot be determined. Our study did not
capture the capital establishment costs of the different facility
types. The American Green House model is reported to havehigher
capital costs than standard residential aged care models, primarily
because more space per resident is needed.29 The establishment
costs for different RACF models in Australia remain to be explored,
but this cost is not borne by government.
This is the first study to examine the potential positive impact on
quality of life, resource use, and the costs of providing residential
aged care in small domestic clusters with a home-like environment.
Our preliminary findings should be further explored in longitu-
dinal, prospective cohort studies, and the association of individual
features of clustered facilities with resource use and quality of life

porting clustered domestic models of residential aged care should
also be assessed.
Acknowledgements: We sincerely thank the INSPIRED study participants and their families for their
participation and interest in the study. The assistance of facility staff, careworker researchers, facility
pharmacists and data collectors in each state is gratefully acknowledged. We thank members of the
study team — Anne Whitehouse, Angela Basso, Keren McKenna, Lua Perimal-Lewis,Wendy Shulver and
Rebecca Bilton — for their input into study management, data collection, and data coordination. We
acknowledge federal and state data custodians of the datasets used and the respective data linkage
organisations, includingthe federal Departmentsof Veterans’Affairs andHuman Services, the Centrefor
Health Record Linkage (NSW Health), the Queensland Health Statistics Unit, the Data and Reporting

The INSPIRED study is supported by funding from the National Health and Medical Research Council
(NHMRC) Partnership Centre on Dealing with Cognitive and Related Functional Decline in Older
People (CDPC, GNT9100000). Australian aged care service providers are partners in the NHMRC
CDPC; they provided information on the organisational structures of residential care and access to
their facilities, but played no role in the analysis or interpretation of the study findings. Tiffany
Easton is supported by a CDPC PhD Scholarship and an Australian Government Research Training
Program Scholarship.
