Objective: To update the “Endocrine Treatment of Transsexual Persons: An Endocrine Society
Clinical Practice Guideline,” published by the Endocrine Society in 2009.
Participants: The participants include an Endocrine Society–appointed task force of nine experts, a
methodologist, and a medical writer.
Evidence: This evidence-based guideline was developed using the Grading of Recommendations,
Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach to describe the strength of recommendations
and the quality of evidence. The task force commissioned two systematic reviews and used the best
available evidence from other published systematic reviews and individual studies.
Consensus Process: Group meetings, conference calls, and e-mail communications enabled
consensus. Endocrine Society committees, members and cosponsoring organizations reviewed
and commented on preliminary drafts of the guidelines.
Conclusion: Gender affirmation is multidisciplinary treatment in which endocrinologists play an
important role. Gender-dysphoric/gender-incongruent persons seek and/or are referred to
endocrinologists to develop the physical characteristics of the affirmed gender. They require a
safe and effective hormone regimen that will (1) suppress endogenous sex hormone
secretion determined by the person’s genetic/gonadal sex and (2) maintain sex hormone
levels within the normal range for the person’s affirmed gender. Hormone treatment is not
recommended for prepubertal gender-dysphoric/gender-incongruent persons. Those clinicians
who recommend gender-affirming endocrine treatments—appropriately trained diagnosing
clinicians (required), a mental health provider for adolescents (required) and mental health

 professional for adults (recommended)—should be knowledgeable about the diagnostic criteria
and criteria for gender-affirming treatment, have sufficient training and experience in assessing
psychopathology, and be willing to participate in the ongoing care throughout the endocrine
transition. We recommend treating gender-dysphoric/gender-incongruent adolescents who have
entered puberty at Tanner Stage G2/B2 by suppression with gonadotropin-releasing hormone
agonists. Clinicians may add gender-affirming hormones after a multidisciplinary team has
confirmed the persistence of gender dysphoria/gender incongruence and sufficient mental
capacity to give informed consent to this partially irreversible treatment. Most adolescents
have this capacity by age 16 years old. We recognize that there may be compelling reasons to
initiate sex hormone treatment prior to age 16 years, although there is minimal published
experience treating prior to 13.5 to 14 years of age. For the care of peripubertal youths and
older adolescents, we recommend that an expert multidisciplinary team comprised of medical
professionals and mental health professionals manage this treatment. The treating physician
must confirm the criteria for treatment used by the referring mental health practitioner and
collaborate with them in decisions about gender-affirming surgery in older adolescents. For adult
gender-dysphoric/gender-incongruent persons, the treating clinicians (collectively) should have
expertise in transgender-specific diagnostic criteria, mental health, primary care, hormone
treatment, and surgery, as needed by the patient. We suggest maintaining physiologic
levels of gender-appropriate hormones and monitoring for known risks and complications.
When high doses of sex steroids are required to suppress endogenous sex steroids and/or in
advanced age, clinicians may consider surgically removing natal gonads along with reducing sex
steroid treatment. Clinicians should monitor both transgender males (female to male) and
transgender females (male to female) for reproductive organ cancer risk when surgical removal
is incomplete. Additionally, clinicians should persistently monitor adverse effects of sex steroids. For
gender-affirming surgeries in adults, the treating physician must collaborate with and confirm the
criteria for treatment used by the referring physician. Clinicians should avoid harming individuals (via
hormone treatment) who have conditions other than gender dysphoria/gender incongruence and
who may not benefit from the physical changes associated with this treatment. (J Clin Endocrinol
Metab 102: 3869–3903, 2017)
Summary of Recommendations
1.0 Evaluation of youth and adults
1.1. We advise that only trained mental health pro-
fessionals (MHPs) who meet the following cri-
teria should diagnose gender dysphoria (GD)/
gender incongruence in adults: (1) competence
in using the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual
of Mental Disorders (DSM) and/or the In-
ternational Statistical Classification of Diseases
and Related Health Problems (ICD) for di-
agnostic purposes, (2) the ability to diagnose GD/
gender incongruence and make a distinction
between GD/gender incongruence and conditions
that have similar features (e.g., body dysmorphic
disorder), (3) training in diagnosing psychiatric
conditions, (4) the ability to undertake or refer
for appropriate treatment, (5) the ability to
psychosocially assess the person’s understanding,
mental health, and social conditions that can
impact gender-affirming hormone therapy, and
(6) a practice of regularly attending relevant
professional meetings. (Ungraded Good Practice
Statement)
1.2. We advise that only MHPs who meet the fol-
lowing criteria should diagnose GD/gender in-
congruence in children and adolescents: (1)
training in child and adolescent developmental
psychology and psychopathology, (2) competence
in using the DSM and/or the ICD for diagnostic
purposes, (3) the ability to make a distinction
between GD/gender incongruence and conditions
that have similar features (e.g., body dysmorphic
disorder), (4) training in diagnosing psychiatric
conditions, (5) the ability to undertake or refer for
appropriate treatment, (6) the ability to psycho-
socially assess the person’s understanding and
social conditions that can impact gender-affirming
hormone therapy, (7) a practice of regularly at-
tending relevant professional meetings, and (8)
knowledge of the criteria for puberty blocking and
gender-affirming hormone treatment in adoles-
cents. (Ungraded Good Practice Statement)
1.3. We advise that decisions regarding the social
transition of prepubertal youths with GD/gender
incongruence are made with the assistance of
an MHP or another experienced professional.

Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/jcem/article-abstract/102/11/3869/4157558 by guest on 02 June 2019
 1.4. We recommend against puberty blocking and
gender-affirming hormone treatment in pre-
pubertal children with GD/gender incongruence.
(1 |��ss)
1.5. We
recommend
that
clinicians
inform
and
counsel all individuals seeking gender-affirming
medical treatment regarding options for fertility
preservation prior to initiating puberty sup-
pression in adolescents and prior to treating with
hormonal therapy of the affirmed gender in both
adolescents and adults. (1 |���s)
2.0 Treatment of adolescents
2.1. We suggest that adolescents who meet diagnostic
criteria for GD/gender incongruence, fulfill cri-
teria for treatment, and are requesting treatment
should initially undergo treatment to suppress
pubertal development. (2 |��ss)
2.2. We suggest that clinicians begin pubertal hor-
mone suppression after girls and boys first exhibit
physical changes of puberty. (2 |��ss)
2.3. We recommend that, where indicated, GnRH
analogues are used to suppress pubertal hor-
mones. (1 |��ss)
2.4. In adolescents who request sex hormone treat-
ment (given this is a partly irreversible treatment),
we recommend initiating treatment using a
gradually increasing dose schedule after a mul-
tidisciplinary team of medical and MHPs has
confirmed the persistence of GD/gender in-
congruence and sufficient mental capacity to give
informed consent, which most adolescents have
by age 16 years. (1 |��ss).
2.5. We recognize that there may be compelling
reasons to initiate sex hormone treatment prior
to the age of 16 years in some adolescents with GD/
gender incongruence, even though there are
minimal published studies of gender-affirming
hormone treatments administered before age 13.5
to 14 years. As with the care of adolescents
$16 years of age, we recommend that an ex-
pert multidisciplinary team of medical and
MHPs manage this treatment. (1 |�sss)
2.6. We suggest monitoring clinical pubertal devel-
opment every 3 to 6 months and laboratory
parameters every 6 to 12 months during sex
hormone treatment. (2 |��ss)
3.0 Hormonal therapy for transgender adults
3.1. We recommend that clinicians confirm the di-
agnostic criteria of GD/gender incongruence and
the criteria for the endocrine phase of gender
transition before beginning treatment. (1 |���s)
3.2. We recommend that clinicians evaluate and ad-
dress medical conditions that can be exacerbated
by hormone depletion and treatment with sex
hormones of the affirmed gender before begin-
ning treatment. (1 |���s)
3.3. We suggest that clinicians measure hormone
levels during treatment to ensure that endog-
enous sex steroids are suppressed and admin-
istered sex steroids are maintained in the
normal physiologic range for the affirmed
gender. (2 |��ss)
3.4. We suggest that endocrinologists provide edu-
cation to transgender individuals undergoing
treatment about the onset and time course of
physical
changes
induced
by
sex
hormone
treatment. (2 |�sss)
4.0 Adverse outcome prevention and long-term care
4.1. We suggest regular clinical evaluation for phys-
ical changes and potential adverse changes in
response to sex steroid hormones and laboratory
monitoring of sex steroid hormone levels every
3 months during the first year of hormone
therapy for transgender males and females and
then once or twice yearly. (2 |��ss)
4.2. We suggest periodically monitoring prolactin
levels in transgender females treated with estro-
gens. (2 |��ss)
4.3. We suggest that clinicians evaluate transgender
persons treated with hormones for cardiovas-
cular risk factors using fasting lipid profiles, di-
abetes screening, and/or other diagnostic tools.
(2 |��ss)
4.4. We recommend that clinicians obtain bone
mineral density (BMD) measurements when risk
factors for osteoporosis exist, specifically in those
who stop sex hormone therapy after gonadec-
tomy. (1 |��ss)
4.5. We suggest that transgender females with no
known increased risk of breast cancer follow
breast-screening guidelines recommended for
non-transgender females. (2 |��ss)
4.6. We suggest that transgender females treated
with estrogens follow individualized screening
according to personal risk for prostatic disease
and prostate cancer. (2 |�sss)
4.7. We advise that clinicians determine the medical
necessity of including a total hysterectomy and
oophorectomy as part of gender-affirming sur-
gery. (Ungraded Good Practice Statement)

 5.0 Surgery for sex reassignment and
gender confirmation
5.1. We recommend that a patient pursue genital
gender-affirming surgery only after the MHP and
the clinician responsible for endocrine transition
therapy both agree that surgery is medically
necessary and would benefit the patient’s overall
health and/or well-being. (1 |��ss)
5.2. We advise that clinicians approve genital gender-
affirming surgery only after completion of at least
1 year of consistent and compliant hormone
treatment, unless hormone therapy is not desired
or medically contraindicated. (Ungraded Good
Practice Statement)
5.3. We advise that the clinician responsible for en-
docrine treatment and the primary care provider
ensure appropriate medical clearance of trans-
gender individuals for genital gender-affirming
surgery and collaborate with the surgeon re-
garding hormone use during and after surgery.
(Ungraded Good Practice Statement)
5.4. We recommend that clinicians refer hormone-
treated transgender individuals for genital sur-
gery when: (1) the individual has had a satisfactory
social role change, (2) the individual is satisfied
about the hormonal effects, and (3) the individual
desires definitive surgical changes. (1 |�sss)
5.5. We suggest that clinicians delay gender-affirming
genital surgery involving gonadectomy and/or
hysterectomy until the patient is at least 18
years old or legal age of majority in his or her
country. (2 |��ss).
5.6. We suggest that clinicians determine the timing of
breast surgery for transgender males based upon
the physical and mental health status of the in-
dividual. There is insufficient evidence to rec-
ommend a specific age requirement. (2 |�sss)
Changes Since the Previous Guideline
Both the current guideline and the one published in 2009
contain similar sections. Listed here are the sections
contained in the current guideline and the corresponding
number of recommendations: Introduction, Evaluation
of Youth and Adults (5), Treatment of Adolescents (6),
Hormonal Therapy for Transgender Adults (4), Adverse
Outcomes Prevention and Long-term Care (7), and
Surgery for Sex Reassignment and Gender Confirmation
(6). The current introduction updates the diagnostic
classification of “gender dysphoria/gender incongru-
ence.” It also reviews the development of “gender identity”
and summarizes its natural development. The section on
clinical evaluation of both youth and adults, defines in
detail the professional qualifications required of those
who diagnose and treat both adolescents and adults.
We advise that decisions regarding the social transition
of prepubertal youth are made with the assistance of a
mental health professional or similarly experienced
professional. We recommend against puberty blocking
followed by gender-affirming hormone treatment of pre-
pubertal children. Clinicians should inform pubertal
children, adolescents, and adults seeking gender-
confirming treatment of their options for fertility preser-
vation. Prior to treatment, clinicians should evaluate the
presence of medical conditions that may be worsened
by hormone depletion and/or treatment. A multidis-
ciplinary team, preferably composed of medical and
mental health professionals, should monitor treat-
ments. Clinicians evaluating transgender adults for
endocrine treatment should confirm the diagnosis of
persistent
gender
dysphoria/gender
incongruence.
Physicians should educate transgender persons re-
garding the time course of steroid-induced physical
changes. Treatment should include periodic monitoring of
hormone levels and metabolic parameters, as well as as-
sessments of bone density and the impact upon prostate,
gonads, and uterus. We also make recommendations for
transgender persons who plan genital gender-affirming
surgery.
Method of Development of Evidence-Based
Clinical Practice Guidelines
The Clinical Guidelines Subcommittee (CGS) of the Endocrine
Society deemed the diagnosis and treatment of individuals with
GD/gender incongruence a priority area for revision and
appointed a task force to formulate evidence-based recom-
mendations. The task force followed the approach recom-
mended by the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment,
Development, and Evaluation group, an international group
with expertise in the development and implementation of
evidence-based guidelines (1). A detailed description of the
grading scheme has been published elsewhere (2). The task force
used the best available research evidence to develop the rec-
ommendations. The task force also used consistent language
and graphical descriptions of both the strength of a recom-
mendation and the quality of evidence. In terms of the strength
of the recommendation, strong recommendations use the phrase
“we recommend” and the number 1, and weak recommenda-
tions use the phrase “we suggest” and the number 2. Cross-filled
circles indicate the quality of the evidence, such that �sss
denotes very low–quality evidence; ��ss, low quality;
���s, moderate quality; and����, high quality. The task
force has confidence that persons who receive care according to
the strong recommendations will derive, on average, more
benefit than harm. Weak recommendations require more
careful consideration of the person’s circumstances, values, and
preferences to determine the best course of action. Linked to
each recommendation is a description of the evidence and the

 values that the task force considered in making the recom-
mendation. In some instances, there are remarks in which the
task force offers technical suggestions for testing conditions,
dosing, and monitoring. These technical comments reflect the
best available evidence applied to a typical person being treated.
Often this evidence comes from the unsystematic observations
of the task force and their preferences; therefore, one should
consider these remarks as suggestions.
In this guideline, the task force made several statements to
emphasize the importance of shared decision-making, general
preventive care measures, and basic principles of the treatment
of transgender persons. They labeled these “Ungraded Good
Practice Statement.” Direct evidence for these statements was
either unavailable or not systematically appraised and consid-
ered out of the scope of this guideline. The intention of these
statements is to draw attention to these principles.
The Endocrine Society maintains a rigorous conflict-of-
interest review process for developing clinical practice guide-
lines. All task force members must declare any potential
conflicts of interest by completing a conflict-of-interest form.
The CGS reviews all conflicts of interest before the Society’s
Council approves the members to participate on the task force
and periodically during the development of the guideline. All
others participating in the guideline’s development must also
disclose any conflicts of interest in the matter under study, and
most of these participants must be without any conflicts of
interest. The CGS and the task force have reviewed all disclo-
sures for this guideline and resolved or managed all identified
conflicts of interest.
Conflicts of interest are defined as remuneration in any
amount from commercial interests; grants; research support;
consulting fees; salary; ownership interests [e.g., stocks and
stock options (excluding diversified mutual funds)]; honoraria
and other payments for participation in speakers’ bureaus,
advisory boards, or boards of directors; and all other financial
benefits. Completed forms are available through the Endocrine
Society office.
The Endocrine Society provided the funding for this
guideline; the task force received no funding or remuneration
from commercial or other entities.
Commissioned Systematic Review
The task force commissioned two systematic reviews to
support this guideline. The first one aimed to summarize
the available evidence on the effect of sex steroid use in
transgender individuals on lipids and cardiovascular
outcomes. The review identified 29 eligible studies at
moderate risk of bias. In transgender males (female to
male), sex steroid therapy was associated with a statis-
tically significant increase in serum triglycerides and
low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. High-density
lipoprotein cholesterol levels decreased significantly
across all follow-up time periods. In transgender females
(male to female), serum triglycerides were significantly
higher without any changes in other parameters. Few
myocardial infarction, stroke, venous thromboembolism
(VTE), and death events were reported. These events were
more frequent in transgender females. However, the
quality of the evidence was low. The second review
summarized the available evidence regarding the effect of
sex steroids on bone health in transgender individuals
and identified 13 studies. In transgender males, there was
no statistically significant difference in the lumbar spine,
femoral neck, or total hip BMD at 12 and 24 months
compared with baseline values before initiating mascu-
linizing hormone therapy. In transgender females, there
was a statistically significant increase in lumbar spine
BMD at 12 months and 24 months compared with
baseline values before initiation of feminizing hormone
therapy. There was minimal information on fracture
rates. The quality of evidence was also low.
Introduction
Throughout recorded history (in the absence of an en-
docrine disorder) some men and women have experi-
enced confusion and anguish resulting from rigid, forced
conformity to sexual dimorphism. In modern history,
there have been numerous ongoing biological, psycho-
logical, cultural, political, and sociological debates over
various aspects of gender variance. The 20th century
marked the emergence of a social awakening for men and
women with the belief that they are “trapped” in the
wrong body (3). Magnus Hirschfeld and Harry Benja-
min, among others, pioneered the medical responses to
those who sought relief from and a resolution to their
profound discomfort. Although the term transsexual
became widely known after Benjamin wrote “The
Transsexual Phenomenon” (4), it was Hirschfeld who
coined the term “transsexual” in 1923 to describe people
who want to live a life that corresponds with their ex-
perienced gender vs their designated gender (5). Magnus
Hirschfeld (6) and others (4, 7) have described other types
of trans phenomena besides transsexualism. These early
researchers proposed that the gender identity of these
people was located somewhere along a unidimensional
continuum. This continuum ranged from all male
through “something in between” to all female. Yet such a
classification does not take into account that people may
have gender identities outside this continuum. For in-
stance, some experience themselves as having both a male
and female gender identity, whereas others completely
renounce any gender classification (8, 9). There are also
reports of individuals experiencing a continuous and
rapid involuntary alternation between a male and female
identity (10) or men who do not experience themselves as
men but do not want to live as women (11, 12). In some
countries, (e.g., Nepal, Bangladesh, and Australia), these
nonmale or nonfemale genders are officially recognized
(13). Specific treatment protocols, however, have not yet
been developed for these groups.

 Instead of the term transsexualism, the current
classification system of the American Psychiatric As-
sociation uses the term gender dysphoria in its di-
agnosis of persons who are not satisfied with their
designated gender (14). The current version of the
World Health Organization’s ICD-10 still uses the term
transsexualism when diagnosing adolescents and
adults. However, for the ICD-11, the World Health
Organization has proposed using the term “gender in-
congruence” (15).
Treating persons with GD/gender incongruence (15)
was previously limited to relatively ineffective elixirs or
creams. However, more effective endocrinology-based
treatments became possible with the availability of
testosterone in 1935 and diethylstilbestrol in 1938.
Reports of individuals with GD/gender incongruence
who were treated with hormones and gender-affirming
surgery appeared in the press during the second half of
the 20th century. The Harry Benjamin International
Gender Dysphoria Association was founded in Sep-
tember 1979 and is now called the World Professional
Association for Transgender Health (WPATH). WPATH
published its first Standards of Care in 1979. These
standards have since been regularly updated, providing
guidance for treating persons with GD/gender in-
congruence (16).
Prior to 1975, few peer-reviewed articles were pub-
lished concerning endocrine treatment of transgender
persons. Since then, more than two thousand articles
about various aspects of transgender care have appeared.
It is the purpose of this guideline to make detailed
recommendations and suggestions, based on existing
medical literature and clinical experience, that will enable
treating physicians to maximize benefit and minimize risk
when caring for individuals diagnosed with GD/gender
incongruence.
In the future, we need more rigorous evaluations of the
effectiveness and safety of endocrine and surgical pro-
tocols. Specifically, endocrine treatment protocols for
GD/gender incongruence should include the careful as-
sessment of the following: (1) the effects of prolonged
delay of puberty in adolescents on bone health, gonadal
function, and the brain (including effects on cognitive,
emotional, social, and sexual development); (2) the ef-
fects of treatment in adults on sex hormone levels; (3)
the requirement for and the effects of progestins and
other agents used to suppress endogenous sex ste-
roids during treatment; and (4) the risks and benefits
of gender-affirming hormone treatment in older trans-
gender people.
To successfully establish and enact these protocols,
a commitment of mental health and endocrine investi-
gators is required to collaborate in long-term, large-scale
studies across countries that use the same diagnostic and
inclusion criteria, medications, assay methods, and re-
sponse assessment tools (e.g., the European Network for
the Investigation of Gender Incongruence) (17, 18).
Terminology and its use vary and continue to evolve.
Table 1 contains the definitions of terms as they are used
throughout this guideline.
Biological Determinants of Gender
Identity Development
One’s self-awareness as male or female changes
gradually during infant life and childhood. This pro-
cess of cognitive and affective learning evolves with
interactions with parents, peers, and environment. A
fairly accurate timetable exists outlining the steps in
this process (19). Normative psychological literature,
however, does not address if and when gender identity
becomes crystallized and what factors contribute to
the development of a gender identity that is not con-
gruent with the gender of rearing. Results of studies
from a variety of biomedical disciplines—genetic,
endocrine, and neuroanatomic—support the concept
that gender identity and/or gender expression (20)
likely reflect a complex interplay of biological, envi-
ronmental, and cultural factors (21, 22).
With respect to endocrine considerations, studies
have failed to find differences in circulating levels of sex
steroids between transgender and nontransgender in-
dividuals (23). However, studies in individuals with a
disorder/difference of sex development (DSD) have in-
formed our understanding of the role that hormones
may play in gender identity outcome, even though most
persons with GD/gender incongruence do not have
a DSD. For example, although most 46,XX adult in-
dividuals with virilizing congenital adrenal hyperplasia
caused by mutations in CYP21A2 reported a female
gender identity, the prevalence of GD/gender in-
congruence was much greater in this group than in the
general population without a DSD. This supports the
concept that there is a role for prenatal/postnatal an-
drogens in gender development (24–26), although some
studies indicate that prenatal androgens are more likely
to affect gender behavior and sexual orientation rather
than gender identity per se (27, 28).
Researchers have made similar observations regarding
the potential role of androgens in the development of gender
identity in other individuals with DSD. For example, a
review of two groups of 46,XY persons, each with an-
drogen synthesis deficiencies and female raised, reported
transgender male (female-to-male) gender role changes in
56% to 63% and 39% to 64% of patients, respectively
(29). Also, in 46,XY female-raised individuals with cloacal

 exstrophy and penile agenesis, the occurrence of trans-
gender male changes was significantly more prevalent
than in the general population (30, 31). However, the fact
that a high percentage of individuals with the same
conditions did not change gender suggests that cultural
factors may play a role as well.
With respect to genetics and gender identity, several
studies have suggested heritability of GD/gender in-
congruence (32, 33). In particular, a study by Heylens
et al. (33) demonstrated a 39.1% concordance rate for
gender identity disorder (based on the DSM-IV criteria) in
23 monozygotic twin pairs but no concordance in 21
same-sex dizygotic or seven opposite-sex twin pairs.
Although numerous investigators have sought to identify
specific genes associated with GD/gender incongruence,
such studies have been inconsistent and without strong
statistical significance (34–38).
Studies focusing on brain structure suggest that the
brain phenotypes of people with GD/gender incongru-
ence differ in various ways from control males and fe-
males, but that there is not a complete sex reversal in
brain structures (39).
In summary, although there is much that is still
unknown with respect to gender identity and its ex-
pression, compelling studies support the concept that
biologic factors, in addition to environmental fac-
tors, contribute to this fundamental aspect of human
development.
Table 1.
Definitions of Terms Used in This Guideline
Biological sex, biological male or female: These terms refer to physical aspects of maleness and femaleness. As these may not be in line
with each other (e.g., a person with XY chromosomes may have female-appearing genitalia), the terms biological sex and biological
male or female are imprecise and should be avoided.
Cisgender: This means not transgender. An alternative way to describe individuals who are not transgender is “non-transgender
people.”
Gender-affirming (hormone) treatment: See “gender reassignment”
Gender dysphoria: This is the distress and unease experienced if gender identity and designated gender are not completely congruent
(see Table 2). In 2013, the American Psychiatric Association released the fifth edition of the DSM-5, which replaced “gender identity
disorder” with “gender dysphoria” and changed the criteria for diagnosis.
Gender expression: This refers to external manifestations of gender, expressed through one’s name, pronouns, clothing, haircut,
behavior, voice, or body characteristics. Typically, transgender people seek to make their gender expression align with their gender
identity, rather than their designated gender.
Gender identity/experienced gender: This refers to one’s internal, deeply held sense of gender. For transgender people, their gender
identity does not match their sex designated at birth. Most people have a gender identity of man or woman (or boy or girl). For some
people, their gender identity does not fit neatly into one of those two choices. Unlike gender expression (see below), gender identity is
not visible to others.
Gender identity disorder: This is the term used for GD/gender incongruence in previous versions of DSM (see “gender dysphoria”). The
ICD-10 still uses the term for diagnosing child diagnoses, but the upcoming ICD-11 has proposed using “gender incongruence of
childhood.”
Gender incongruence: This is an umbrella term used when the gender identity and/or gender expression differs from what is typically
associated with the designated gender. Gender incongruence is also the proposed name of the gender identity–related diagnoses in
ICD-11. Not all individuals with gender incongruence have gender dysphoria or seek treatment.
Gender variance: See “gender incongruence”
Gender reassignment: This refers to the treatment procedure for those who want to adapt their bodies to the experienced gender by
means of hormones and/or surgery. This is also called gender-confirming or gender-affirming treatment.
Gender-reassignment surgery (gender-confirming/gender-affirming surgery): These terms refer only to the surgical part of gender-
confirming/gender-affirming treatment.
Gender role: This refers to behaviors, attitudes, and personality traits that a society (in a given culture and historical period) designates as
masculine or feminine and/or that society associates with or considers typical of the social role of men or women.
Sex designated at birth: This refers to sex assigned at birth, usually based on genital anatomy.
Sex: This refers to attributes that characterize biological maleness or femaleness. The best known attributes include the sex-determining
genes, the sex chromosomes, the H-Y antigen, the gonads, sex hormones, internal and external genitalia, and secondary sex
characteristics.
Sexual orientation: This term describes an individual’s enduring physical and emotional attraction to another person. Gender identity and
sexual orientation are not the same. Irrespective of their gender identity, transgender people may be attracted to women (gynephilic),
attracted to men (androphilic), bisexual, asexual, or queer.
Transgender: This is an umbrella term for people whose gender identity and/or gender expression differs from what is typically associated
with their sex designated at birth. Not all transgender individuals seek treatment.
Transgender male (also: trans man, female-to-male, transgender male): This refers to individuals assigned female at birth but who
identify and live as men.
Transgender woman (also: trans woman, male-to female, transgender female): This refers to individuals assigned male at birth but who
identify and live as women.
Transition: This refers to the process during which transgender persons change their physical, social, and/or legal characteristics
consistent with the affirmed gender identity. Prepubertal children may choose to transition socially.
Transsexual: This is an older term that originated in the medical and psychological communities to refer to individuals who have
permanently transitioned through medical interventions or desired to do so.

 Natural History of Children With
GD/Gender Incongruence
With current knowledge, we cannot predict the psy-
chosexual outcome for any specific child. Prospective
follow-up studies show that childhood GD/gender in-
congruence does not invariably persist into adolescence
and adulthood (so-called “desisters”). Combining all
outcome studies to date, the GD/gender incongruence
of a minority of prepubertal children appears to persist
in adolescence (20, 40). In adolescence, a significant
number of these desisters identify as homosexual or
bisexual. It may be that children who only showed some
gender nonconforming characteristics have been in-
cluded in the follow-up studies, because the DSM-IV
text revision criteria for a diagnosis were rather broad.
However, the persistence of GD/gender incongruence
into adolescence is more likely if it had been extreme in
childhood (41, 42). With the newer, stricter criteria of
the DSM-5 (Table 2), persistence rates may well be
different in future studies.
1.0 Evaluation of Youth and Adults
Gender-affirming treatment is a multidisciplinary effort.
After evaluation, education, and diagnosis, treatment may
include mental health care, hormone therapy, and/or
surgical therapy. Together with an MHP, hormone-
prescribing clinicians should examine the psychosocial
impact of the potential changes on people’s lives, including
mental health, friends, family, jobs, and their role in so-
ciety. Transgender individuals should be encouraged to
experience living in the new gender role and assess whether
this improves their quality of life. Although the focus of
this guideline is gender-affirming hormone therapy, col-
laboration with appropriate professionals responsible for
each aspect of treatment maximizes a successful outcome.
Diagnostic assessment and mental health care
GD/gender incongruence may be accompanied with
psychological or psychiatric problems (43–51). It is
therefore necessary that clinicians who prescribe hor-
mones and are involved in diagnosis and psychosocial
assessment meet the following criteria: (1) are competent
in using the DSM and/or the ICD for diagnostic pur-
poses, (2) are able to diagnose GD/gender incongruence
and make a distinction between GD/gender incongru-
ence and conditions that have similar features (e.g., body
dysmorphic disorder), (3) are trained in diagnosing
psychiatric conditions, (4) undertake or refer for ap-
propriate treatment, (5) are able to do a psychosocial
assessment of the patient’s understanding, mental
health, and social conditions that can impact gender-
affirming hormone therapy, and (6) regularly attend
relevant professional meetings.
Because of the psychological vulnerability of many
individuals with GD/gender incongruence, it is important
that mental health care is available before, during, and
sometimes also after transitioning. For children and
adolescents, an MHP who has training/experience in
child and adolescent gender development (as well as child
and adolescent psychopathology) should make the di-
agnosis, because assessing GD/gender incongruence in
children and adolescents is often extremely complex.
During assessment, the clinician obtains information from
the individual seeking gender-affirming treatment. In the case
Table 2.
DSM-5 Criteria for Gender Dysphoria in Adolescents and Adults
A. A marked incongruence between one’s experienced/expressed gender and natal gender of at least 6 mo in duration, as manifested by
at least two of the following:
1. A marked incongruence between one’s experienced/expressed gender and primary and/or secondary sex characteristics (or in
young adolescents, the anticipated secondary sex characteristics)
2. A strong desire to be rid of one’s primary and/or secondary sex characteristics because of a marked incongruence with one’s
experienced/expressed gender (or in young adolescents, a desire to prevent the development of the anticipated secondary sex
characteristics)
3. A strong desire for the primary and/or secondary sex characteristics of the other gender
4. A strong desire to be of the other gender (or some alternative gender different from one’s designated gender)
5. A strong desire to be treated as the other gender (or some alternative gender different from one’s designated gender)
6. A strong conviction that one has the typical feelings and reactions of the other gender (or some alternative gender different from
one’s designated gender)
B. The condition is associated with clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of
functioning.
Specify if:
1. The condition exists with a disorder of sex development.
2. The condition is posttransitional, in that the individual has transitioned to full-time living in the desired gender (with or without
legalization of gender change) and has undergone (or is preparing to have) at least one sex-related medical procedure or treatment
regimen—namely, regular sex hormone treatment or gender reassignment surgery confirming the desired gender (e.g.,
penectomy, vaginoplasty in natal males; mastectomy or phalloplasty in natal females).

 of adolescents, the clinician also obtains informa-
tion from the parents or guardians regarding various
aspects of the child’s general and psychosexual devel-
opment and current functioning. On the basis of this
information, the clinician:
· decides whether the individual fulfills criteria for
treatment (see Tables 2 and 3) for GD/gender in-
congruence (DSM-5) or transsexualism (DSM-5
and/or ICD-10);
· informs the individual about the possibilities and
limitations of various kinds of treatment (hormonal/
surgical and nonhormonal), and if medical treat-
ment is desired, provides correct information to
prevent unrealistically high expectations;
· assesses whether medical interventions may result in
unfavorable psychological and social outcomes.
In cases in which severe psychopathology, circumstances,
or both seriously interfere with the diagnostic work or make
satisfactory treatment unlikely, clinicians should assist the
adolescent in managing these other issues. Literature on
postoperative regret suggests that besides poor quality of
surgery, severe psychiatric comorbidity and lack of support
may interfere with positive outcomes (52–56).
For adolescents, the diagnostic procedure usually
includes a complete psychodiagnostic assessment (57)
and an assessment of the decision-making capability of
the youth. An evaluation to assess the family’s ability to
endure stress, give support, and deal with the complex-
ities of the adolescent’s situation should be part of the
diagnostic phase (58).
Social transitioning
A change in gender expression and role (which may
involve living part time or full time in another gender role
that is consistent with one’s gender identity) may test the
person’s resolve, the capacity to function in the affirmed
gender, and the adequacy of social, economic, and psy-
chological supports. It assists both the individual and the
clinician in their judgments about how to proceed (16).
During social transitioning, the person’s feelings about
the social transformation (including coping with the re-
sponses of others) is a major focus of the counseling.
The optimal timing for social transitioning may differ
between individuals. Sometimes people wait until they
start gender-affirming hormone treatment to make social
transitioning easier, but individuals increasingly start
social transitioning long before they receive medically
supervised, gender-affirming hormone treatment.
Criteria
Adolescents and adults seeking gender-affirming
hormone treatment and surgery should satisfy certain
criteria before proceeding (16). Criteria for gender-
affirming hormone therapy for adults are in Table 4,
and criteria for gender-affirming hormone therapy for
adolescents are in Table 5. Follow-up studies in adults
meeting these criteria indicate a high satisfaction rate
with treatment (59). However, the quality of evidence is
usually low. A few follow-up studies on adolescents who
fulfilled these criteria also indicated good treatment
results (60–63).
Recommendations for Those Involved
in the Gender-Affirming Hormone
Treatment of Individuals With
GD/Gender Incongruence
1.1. We advise that only trained MHPs who meet the
following criteria should diagnose GD/gender
incongruence in adults: (1) competence in using
the DSM and/or the ICD for diagnostic purposes,
(2) the ability to diagnose GD/gender incongru-
ence and make a distinction between GD/gender
incongruence and conditions that have similar
features (e.g., body dysmorphic disorder), (3)
training in diagnosing psychiatric conditions, (4)
the ability to undertake or refer for appropriate
treatment, (5) the ability to psychosocially assess
the person’s understanding, mental health, and
social conditions that can impact gender-affirming
hormone therapy, and (6) a practice of regularly
attending relevant professional meetings. (Un-
graded Good Practice Statement)
1.2. We advise that only MHPs who meet the fol-
lowing criteria should diagnose GD/gender in-
congruence in children and adolescents: (1)
training in child and adolescent developmental
psychology and psychopathology, (2) compe-
tence in using the DSM and/or ICD for diagnostic
Table 3.
ICD-10 Criteria for Transsexualism
Transsexualism (F64.0) has three criteria:
1. The desire to live and be accepted as a member of the opposite sex, usually accompanied by the wish to make his or her body as
congruent as possible with the preferred sex through surgery and hormone treatments.
2. The transsexual identity has been present persistently for at least 2 y.
3. The disorder is not a symptom of another mental disorder or a genetic, DSD, or chromosomal abnormality.

 purposes, (3) the ability to make a distinction
between GD/gender incongruence and conditions
that have similar features (e.g., body dysmorphic
disorder), (4) training in diagnosing psychiatric
conditions, (5) the ability to undertake or refer for
appropriate treatment, (6) the ability to psycho-
socially assess the person’s understanding and
social conditions that can impact gender-affirming
hormone therapy, (7) a practice of regularly at-
tending relevant professional meetings, and (8)
knowledge of the criteria for puberty blocking
and gender-affirming hormone treatment in ad-
olescents. (Ungraded Good Practice Statement)
Evidence
Individuals with gender identity issues may have
psychological or psychiatric problems (43–48, 50, 51, 64,
65). It is therefore necessary that clinicians making the
diagnosis are able to make a distinction between GD/
gender incongruence and conditions that have similar
features. Examples of conditions with similar features are
body dysmorphic disorder, body identity integrity dis-
order (a condition in which individuals have a sense that
their anatomical configuration as an able-bodied person
is somehow wrong or inappropriate) (66), or certain
forms of eunuchism (in which a person is preoccupied
with or engages in castration and/or penectomy for
Table 4.
Criteria for Gender-Affirming Hormone Therapy for Adults
1. Persistent, well-documented gender dysphoria/gender incongruence
2. The capacity to make a fully informed decision and to consent for treatment
3. The age of majority in a given country (if younger, follow the criteria for adolescents)
4. Mental health concerns, if present, must be reasonably well controlled

Table 5.
Criteria for Gender-Affirming Hormone Therapy for Adolescents
Adolescents are eligible for GnRH agonist treatment if:
1. A qualified MHP has confirmed that:
·the adolescent has demonstrated a long-lasting and intense pattern of gender nonconformity or gender dysphoria (whether
suppressed or expressed),
·gender dysphoria worsened with the onset of puberty,
·any coexisting psychological, medical, or social problems that could interfere with treatment (e.g., that may compromise treatment
adherence) have been addressed, such that the adolescent’s situation and functioning are stable enough to start treatment,
·the adolescent has sufficient mental capacity to give informed consent to this (reversible) treatment,
2. And the adolescent:
·has been informed of the effects and side effects of treatment (including potential loss of fertility if the individual subsequently
continues with sex hormone treatment) and options to preserve fertility,
·has given informed consent and (particularly when the adolescent has not reached the age of legal medical consent, depending on
applicable legislation) the parents or other caretakers or guardians have consented to the treatment and are involved in supporting
the adolescent throughout the treatment process,
3. And a pediatric endocrinologist or other clinician experienced in pubertal assessment
·agrees with the indication for GnRH agonist treatment,
·has confirmed that puberty has started in the adolescent (Tanner stage $G2/B2),
·has confirmed that there are no medical contraindications to GnRH agonist treatment.
Adolescents are eligible for subsequent sex hormone treatment if:
1. A qualified MHP has confirmed:
·the persistence of gender dysphoria,
·any coexisting psychological, medical, or social problems that could interfere with treatment (e.g., that may compromise treatment
adherence) have been addressed, such that the adolescent’s situation and functioning are stable enough to start sex hormone
treatment,
·the adolescent has sufficient mental capacity (which most adolescents have by age 16 years) to estimate the consequences of this
(partly) irreversible treatment, weigh the benefits and risks, and give informed consent to this (partly) irreversible treatment,
2. And the adolescent:
·has been informed of the (irreversible) effects and side effects of treatment (including potential loss of fertility and options to preserve
fertility),
·has given informed consent and (particularly when the adolescent has not reached the age of legal medical consent, depending on
applicable legislation) the parents or other caretakers or guardians have consented to the treatment and are involved in supporting
the adolescent throughout the treatment process,
3. And a pediatric endocrinologist or other clinician experienced in pubertal induction:
·agrees with the indication for sex hormone treatment,
·has confirmed that there are no medical contraindications to sex hormone treatment.

 reasons that are not gender identity related) (11). Clini-
cians should also be able to diagnose psychiatric condi-
tions accurately and ensure that these conditions are
treated appropriately, particularly when the conditions
may complicate treatment, affect the outcome of gender-
affirming treatment, or be affected by hormone use.
Values and preferences
The task force placed a very high value on avoiding
harm from hormone treatment in individuals who have
conditions other than GD/gender incongruence and who
may not benefit from the physical changes associated
with this treatment and placed a low value on any po-
tential benefit these persons believe they may derive from
hormone treatment. This justifies the good practice
statement.
1.3. We advise that decisions regarding the social
transition of prepubertal youths with GD/gender
incongruence are made with the assistance of
an MHP or another experienced professional.
(Ungraded Good Practice Statement).
1.4. We recommend against puberty blocking and
gender-affirming hormone treatment in pre-
pubertal children with GD/gender incongruence.
(1 |��ss)
Evidence
In most children diagnosed with GD/gender in-
congruence, it did not persist into adolescence. The
percentages differed among studies, probably dependent
on which version of the DSM clinicians used, the patient’s
age, the recruitment criteria, and perhaps cultural factors.
However, the large majority (about 85%) of prepubertal
children with a childhood diagnosis did not remain GD/
gender incongruent in adolescence (20). If children have
completely socially transitioned, they may have great
difficulty in returning to the original gender role upon
entering puberty (40). Social transition is associated with
the persistence of GD/gender incongruence as a child
progresses into adolescence. It may be that the presence of
GD/gender incongruence in prepubertal children is the
earliest sign that a child is destined to be transgender as
an adolescent/adult (20). However, social transition (in
addition to GD/gender incongruence) has been found to
contribute to the likelihood of persistence.
This recommendation, however, does not imply that
children should be discouraged from showing gender-
variant behaviors or should be punished for exhibiting
such behaviors. In individual cases, an early complete
social transition may result in a more favorable out-
come, but there are currently no criteria to identify the
GD/gender-incongruent children to whom this applies.
At the present time, clinical experience suggests that per-
sistence of GD/gender incongruence can only be reliably
assessed after the first signs of puberty.
Values and preferences
The task force placed a high value on avoiding harm
with gender-affirming hormone therapy in prepubertal
children with GD/gender incongruence. This justifies
the strong recommendation in the face of low-quality
evidence.
1.5. We
recommend
that
clinicians
inform
and
counsel all individuals seeking gender-affirming
medical treatment regarding options for fertility
preservation prior to initiating puberty sup-
pression in adolescents and prior to treating with
hormonal therapy of the affirmed gender in both
adolescents and adults. (1 |���s)
Remarks
Persons considering hormone use for gender affir-
mation need adequate information about this treatment
in general and about fertility effects of hormone treatment
in particular to make an informed and balanced decision
(67, 68). Because young adolescents may not feel qual-
ified to make decisions about fertility and may not fully
understand the potential effects of hormonal interven-
tions, consent and protocol education should include
parents, the referring MHP(s), and other members of the
adolescent’s support group. To our knowledge, there are
no formally evaluated decision aids available to assist
in the discussion and decision regarding the future fertil-
ity of adolescents or adults beginning gender-affirming
treatment.
Treating early pubertal youth with GnRH analogs will
temporarily impair spermatogenesis and oocyte matu-
ration. Given that an increasing number of transgender
youth want to preserve fertility potential, delaying or
temporarily discontinuing GnRH analogs to promote
gamete maturation is an option. This option is often not
preferred, because mature sperm production is associated
with later stages of puberty and with the significant de-
velopment of secondary sex characteristics.
For those designated male at birth with GD/gender
incongruence and who are in early puberty, sperm pro-
duction and the development of the reproductive tract are
insufficient for the cryopreservation of sperm. However,
prolonged pubertal suppression using GnRH analogs is
reversible and clinicians should inform these individuals
that sperm production can be initiated following pro-
longed gonadotropin suppression. This can be accom-
plished by spontaneous gonadotropin recovery after

 cessation of GnRH analogs or by gonadotropin treat-
ment and will probably be associated with physical
manifestations of testosterone production, as stated
above. Note that there are no data in this population
concerning the time required for sufficient spermato-
genesis to collect enough sperm for later fertility. In males
treated for precocious puberty, spermarche was reported
0.7 to 3 years after cessation of GnRH analogs (69). In
adult men with gonadotropin deficiency, sperm are noted
in seminal fluid by 6 to 12 months of gonadotropin
treatment. However, sperm numbers when partners of
these patients conceive are far below the “normal range”
(70, 71).
In girls, no studies have reported long-term, adverse
effects of pubertal suppression on ovarian function after
treatment cessation (72, 73). Clinicians should inform
adolescents that no data are available regarding either
time to spontaneous ovulation after cessation of GnRH
analogs or the response to ovulation induction following
prolonged gonadotropin suppression.
In males with GD/gender incongruence, when medical
treatment is started in a later phase of puberty or in
adulthood, spermatogenesis is sufficient for cryopreser-
vation and storage of sperm. In vitro spermatogenesis is
currently under investigation. Restoration of spermato-
genesis after prolonged estrogen treatment has not
been studied.
In females with GD/gender incongruence, the effect of
prolonged treatment with exogenous testosterone on
ovarian function is uncertain. There have been reports of
an increased incidence of polycystic ovaries in trans-
gender males, both prior to and as a result of androgen
treatment (74–77), although these reports were not
confirmed by others (78). Pregnancy has been reported in
transgender males who have had prolonged androgen
treatment and have discontinued testosterone but have
not had genital surgery (79, 80). A reproductive endo-
crine gynecologist can counsel patients before gender-
affirming hormone treatment or surgery regarding
potential fertility options (81). Techniques for cryo-
preservation of oocytes, embryos, and ovarian tissue
continue to improve, and oocyte maturation of immature
tissue is being studied (82).
2.0 Treatment of Adolescents
During the past decade, clinicians have progressively
acknowledged the suffering of young adolescents with
GD/gender incongruence. In some forms of GD/gender
incongruence, psychological interventions may be useful
and sufficient. However, for many adolescents with GD/
gender incongruence, the pubertal physical changes are
unbearable. As early medical intervention may prevent
psychological harm, various clinics have decided to start
treating young adolescents with GD/gender incongruence
with puberty-suppressing medication (a GnRH analog).
As compared with starting gender-affirming treatment
long after the first phases of puberty, a benefit of pubertal
suppression at early puberty may be a better psycho-
logical and physical outcome.
In girls, the first physical sign of puberty is the budding
of the breasts followed by an increase in breast and fat
tissue. Breast development is also associated with the
pubertal growth spurt, and menarche occurs ;2 years
later. In boys, the first physical change is testicular
growth. A testicular volume $4 mL is seen as consistent
with the initiation of physical puberty. At the beginning
of puberty, estradiol and testosterone levels are still low
and are best measured in the early morning with an ul-
trasensitive assay. From a testicular volume of 10 mL,
daytime testosterone levels increase, leading to viriliza-
tion (83). Note that pubic hair and/or axillary hair/odor
may not reflect the onset of gonadarche; instead, it may
reflect adrenarche alone.
2.1. We suggest that adolescents who meet diagnostic
criteria for GD/gender incongruence, fulfill cri-
teria for treatment (Table 5), and are requesting
treatment should initially undergo treatment to
suppress pubertal development. (2 |��ss)
2.2. We suggest that clinicians begin pubertal hor-
mone suppression after girls and boys first ex-
hibit physical changes of puberty (Tanner stages
G2/B2). (2 |��ss)
Evidence
Pubertal suppression can expand the diagnostic phase
by a long period, giving the subject more time to explore
options and to live in the experienced gender before
making a decision to proceed with gender-affirming sex
hormone treatments and/or surgery, some of which is ir-
reversible (84, 85). Pubertal suppression is fully reversible,
enabling full pubertal development in the natal gender,
after cessation of treatment, if appropriate. The experience
of full endogenous puberty is an undesirable condition for
the GD/gender-incongruent individual and may seri-
ously interfere with healthy psychological functioning
and well-being. Treating GD/gender-incongruent ad-
olescents entering puberty with GnRH analogs has
been shown to improve psychological functioning in
several domains (86).
Another reason to start blocking pubertal hormones
early in puberty is that the physical outcome is improved
compared with initiating physical transition after puberty
has been completed (60, 62). Looking like a man or
woman when living as the opposite sex creates difficult

 barriers with enormous life-long disadvantages. We
therefore advise starting suppression in early puberty to
prevent the irreversible development of undesirable sec-
ondary sex characteristics. However, adolescents with
GD/gender incongruence should experience the first
changes of their endogenous spontaneous puberty, be-
cause their emotional reaction to these first physical
changes has diagnostic value in establishing the persis-
tence of GD/gender incongruence (85). Thus, Tanner
stage 2 is the optimal time to start pubertal suppression.
However, pubertal suppression treatment in early pu-
berty will limit the growth of the penis and scrotum,
which will have a potential effect on future surgical
treatments (87).
Clinicians can also use pubertal suppression in ado-
lescents in later pubertal stages to stop menses in trans-
gender
males
and
prevent
facial
hair
growth
in
transgender females. However, in contrast to the effects
in early pubertal adolescents, physical sex characteristics
(such as more advanced breast development in trans-
gender boys and lowering of the voice and outgrowth of
the jaw and brow in transgender girls) are not reversible.
Values and preferences
These recommendations
place a high
value
on
avoiding an unsatisfactory physical outcome when sec-
ondary sex characteristics have become manifest and
irreversible, a higher value on psychological well-being,
and a lower value on avoiding potential harm from early
pubertal suppression.
Remarks
Table 6 lists the Tanner stages of breast and male
genital development. Careful documentation of hall-
marks of pubertal development will ensure precise timing
when initiating pubertal suppression once puberty has
started. Clinicians can use pubertal LH and sex steroid
levels to confirm that puberty has progressed sufficiently
before starting pubertal suppression (88). Reference
ranges for sex steroids by Tanner stage may vary
depending on the assay used. Ultrasensitive sex steroid
and gonadotropin assays will help clinicians document
early pubertal changes.
Irreversible and, for GD/gender-incongruent adoles-
cents, undesirable sex characteristics in female puberty
are breasts, female body habitus, and, in some cases,
relative short stature. In male puberty, they are a
prominent Adam’s apple; low voice; male bone config-
uration, such as a large jaw, big feet and hands, and tall
stature; and male hair pattern on the face and extremities.
2.3. We recommend that, where indicated, GnRH
analogues are used to suppress pubertal hor-
mones. (1 |��ss)
Evidence
Clinicians can suppress pubertal development and
gonadal function most effectively via gonadotropin
suppression using GnRH analogs. GnRH analogs are
long-acting agonists that suppress gonadotropins by
GnRH receptor desensitization after an initial increase of
gonadotropins during ;10 days after the first and (to a
lesser degree) the second injection (89). Antagonists
immediately suppress pituitary gonadotropin secretion
(90, 91). Long-acting GnRH analogs are the currently
preferred treatment option. Clinicians may consider long-
acting GnRH antagonists when evidence on their safety
and efficacy in adolescents becomes available.
During GnRH analog treatment, slight development
of secondary sex characteristics may regress, and in a
later phase of pubertal development, it will stop. In girls,
breast tissue will become atrophic, and menses will stop.
In boys, virilization will stop, and testicular volume may
decrease (92).
An advantage of using GnRH analogs is the reversibility
of the intervention. If, after extensive exploration of his/her
transition wish, the individual no longer desires transition,
they can discontinue pubertal suppression. In subjects with

 precocious puberty, spontaneous pubertal development
has been shown to resume after patients discontinue taking
GnRH analogs (93).
Recommendations 2.1 to 2.3 are supported by a
prospective follow-up study from The Netherlands. This
report assessed mental health outcomes in 55 transgender
adolescents/young adults (22 transgender females and 33
transgender males) at three time points: (1) before the
start of GnRH agonist (average age of 14.8 years at start
of treatment), (2) at initiation of gender-affirming hor-
mones (average age of 16.7 years at start of treatment),
and (3) 1 year after “gender-reassignment surgery”
(average age of 20.7 years) (63). Despite a decrease in
depression and an improvement in general mental health
functioning, GD/gender incongruence persisted through
pubertal suppression, as previously reported (86). How-
ever, following sex hormone treatment and gender-
reassignment surgery, GD/gender incongruence was
resolved and psychological functioning steadily improved
(63). Furthermore, well-being was similar to or better than
that reported by age-matched young adults from the
general population, and none of the study participants
regretted treatment. This study represents the first long-
term follow-up of individuals managed according to
currently existing clinical practice guidelines for trans-
gender youth, and it underscores the benefit of the mul-
tidisciplinary approach pioneered in The Netherlands;
however, further studies are needed.
Side effects
The primary risks of pubertal suppression in GD/
gender-incongruent adolescents may include adverse ef-
fects on bone mineralization (which can theoretically be
reversed with sex hormone treatment), compromised
fertility if the person subsequently is treated with sex
hormones, and unknown effects on brain development.
Few data are available on the effect of GnRH analogs on
BMD in adolescents with GD/gender incongruence. Ini-
tial data in GD/gender-incongruent subjects demon-
strated no change of absolute areal BMD during 2 years
of GnRH analog therapy but a decrease in BMD z scores
(85). A recent study also suggested suboptimal bone
mineral accrual during GnRH analog treatment. The
study reported a decrease in areal BMD z scores and of
bone mineral apparent density z scores (which takes the
size of the bone into account) in 19 transgender males
treated with GnRH analogs from a mean age of 15.0
years (standard deviation = 2.0 years) for a median du-
ration of 1.5 years (0.3 to 5.2 years) and in 15 transgender
females treated from 14.9 (61.9) years for 1.3 years (0.5
to 3.8 years), although not all changes were statistically
significant (94). There was incomplete catch-up at age 22
years after sex hormone treatment from age 16.6 (61.4)
years for a median duration of 5.8 years (3.0 to 8.0 years)
in transgender females and from age 16.4 (62.3) years for
5.4 years (2.8 to 7.8 years) in transgender males. Little is
known about more prolonged use of GnRH analogs.
Researchers reported normal BMD z scores at age 35
years in one individual who used GnRH analogs from age
13.7 years until age 18.6 years before initiating sex
hormone treatment (65).
Additional data are available from individuals with
late puberty or GnRH analog treatment of other in-
dications. Some studies reported that men with consti-
tutionally delayed puberty have decreased BMD in
adulthood (95). However, other studies reported that
these men have normal BMD (96, 97). Treating adults
with GnRH analogs results in a decrease of BMD (98). In
children with central precocious puberty, treatment with
GnRH analogs has been found to result in a decrease of
BMD during treatment by some (99) but not others (100).
Studies have reported normal BMD after discontinuing
therapy (69, 72, 73, 101, 102). In adolescents treated
with growth hormone who are small for gestational age
and have normal pubertal timing, 2-year GnRH analog
treatments did not adversely affect BMD (103). Calcium
supplementation may be beneficial in optimizing bone
health in GnRH analog–treated individuals (104). There
are no studies of vitamin D supplementation in this
context, but clinicians should offer supplements to vi-
tamin D–deficient adolescents. Physical activity, espe-
cially during growth, is important for bone mass in
healthy individuals (103) and is therefore likely to be
beneficial for bone health in GnRH analog–treated
subjects.
GnRH analogs did not induce a change in body
mass index standard deviation score in GD/gender-
incongruent adolescents (94) but caused an increase in
fat mass and decrease in lean body mass percentage (92).
Studies in girls treated for precocious puberty also
reported a stable body mass index standard deviation
score during treatment (72) and body mass index and
body composition comparable to controls after treat-
ment (73).
Arterial hypertension has been reported as an adverse
effect in a few girls treated with GnRH analogs for
precocious/early puberty (105, 106). Blood pressure
monitoring before and during treatment is recommended.
Individuals may also experience hot flashes, fatigue,
and mood alterations as a consequence of pubertal
suppression. There is no consensus on treatment of these
side effects in this context.
It is recommended that any use of pubertal blockers
(and subsequent use of sex hormones, as detailed below)
include a discussion about implications for fertility (see
recommendation 1.3). Transgender adolescents may

 want to preserve fertility, which may be otherwise
compromised if puberty is suppressed at an early stage
and the individual completes phenotypic transition with
the use of sex hormones.
Limited data are available regarding the effects of
GnRH analogs on brain development. A single cross-
sectional study demonstrated no compromise of execu-
tive function (107), but animal data suggest there may be
an effect of GnRH analogs on cognitive function (108).
Values and preferences
Our recommendation of GnRH analogs places a higher
value on the superior efficacy, safety, and reversibility of
the pubertal hormone suppression achieved (as compared
with the alternatives) and a relatively lower value on
limiting the cost of therapy. Of the available alternatives,
depot and oral progestin preparations are effective. Ex-
perience with this treatment dates back prior to the
emergence of GnRH analogs for treating precocious pu-
berty in papers from the 1960s and early 1970s (109–112).
These compounds are usually safe, but some side effects
have been reported (113–115). Only two recent studies
involved transgender youth (116, 117). One of these
studies described the use of oral lynestrenol monotherapy
followed by the addition of testosterone treatment in
transgender boys who were at Tanner stage B4 or further
at the start of treatment (117). They found lynestrenol safe,
but gonadotropins were not fully suppressed. The study
reported metrorrhagia in approximately half of the in-
dividuals, mainly in the first 6 months. Acne, headache,
hot flashes, and fatigue were other frequent side effects.
Another progestin that has been studied in the United
States is medroxyprogesterone. This agent is not as ef-
fective as GnRH analogs in lowering endogenous sex
hormones either and may be associated with other side
effects (116). Progestin preparations may be an acceptable
treatment for persons without access to GnRH analogs or
with a needle phobia. If GnRH analog treatment is not
available (insurance denial, prohibitive cost, or other
reasons), postpubertal, transgender female adolescents
may be treated with an antiandrogen that directly sup-
presses androgen synthesis or action (see adult section).
Remarks
Measurements of gonadotropin and sex steroid levels
give precise information about gonadal axis suppression,
although there is insufficient evidence for any specific
short-term monitoring scheme in children treated with
GnRH analogs (88). If the gonadal axis is not completely
suppressed—as evidenced by (for example) menses, erec-
tions, or progressive hair growth—the interval of GnRH
analog treatment can be shortened or the dose increased.
During treatment, adolescents should be monitored for
negative effects of delaying puberty, including a halted
growth spurt and impaired bone mineral accretion. Table 7
illustrates a suggested clinical protocol.
Anthropometric measurements and X-rays of the left
hand to monitor bone age are informative for evaluating
growth. To assess BMD, clinicians can perform dual-
energy X-ray absorptiometry scans.
2.4. In adolescents who request sex hormone treat-
ment (given this is a partly irreversible treatment),
we recommend initiating treatment using a
gradually increasing dose schedule (see Table 8)
after a multidisciplinary team of medical and
MHPs has confirmed the persistence of GD/
gender incongruence and sufficient mental ca-
pacity to give informed consent, which most
adolescents have by age 16 years (Table 5).
(1 |��ss)
2.5. We recognize that there may be compelling
reasons to initiate sex hormone treatment prior to
the age of 16 years in some adolescents with GD/
gender incongruence, even though there are
minimal published studies of gender-affirming
hormone treatments administered before age
13.5 to 14 years. As with the care of adolescents
$16 years of age, we recommend that an expert
multidisciplinary team of medical and MHPs
manage this treatment. (1 |�sss)
2.6. We suggest monitoring clinical pubertal devel-
opment every 3 to 6 months and laboratory
parameters every 6 to 12 months during sex
hormone treatment (Table 9). (2 |��ss)

 Evidence
Adolescents develop competence in decision making at
their own pace. Ideally, the supervising medical pro-
fessionals should individually assess this competence,
although no objective tools to make such an assessment
are currently available.
Many adolescents have achieved a reasonable level of
competence by age 15 to 16 years (119), and in many
countries 16-year-olds are legally competent with regard
to medical decision making (120). However, others be-
lieve that although some capacities are generally achieved
before age 16 years, other abilities (such as good risk
assessment) do not develop until well after 18 years (121).
They suggest that health care procedures should be di-
vided along a matrix of relative risk, so that younger
adolescents can be allowed to decide about low-risk
procedures, such as most diagnostic tests and common
therapies, but not about high-risk procedures, such as
most surgical procedures (121).
Currently available data from transgender adolescents
support treatment with sex hormones starting at age 16
years (63, 122). However, some patients may incur po-
tential risks by waiting until age 16 years. These include
the potential risk to bone health if puberty is suppressed

 for 6 to 7 years before initiating sex hormones (e.g., if
someone reached Tanner stage 2 at age 9-10 years old).
Additionally, there may be concerns about inappropriate
height and potential harm to mental health (emotional
and social isolation) if initiation of secondary sex char-
acteristics must wait until the person has reached 16 years
of age. However, only minimal data supporting earlier
use of gender-affirming hormones in transgender ado-
lescents currently exist (63). Clearly, long-term studies
are needed to determine the optimal age of sex hormone
treatment in GD/gender-incongruent adolescents.
The MHP who has followed the adolescent during
GnRH analog treatment plays an essential role in
assessing whether the adolescent is eligible to start sex
hormone therapy and capable of consenting to this
treatment (Table 5). Support of the family/environment is
essential. Prior to the start of sex hormones, clinicians
should discuss the implications for fertility (see recom-
mendation 1.5). Throughout pubertal induction, an
MHP and a pediatric endocrinologist (or other clinician
competent in the evaluation and induction of pubertal
development) should monitor the adolescent. In addition
to monitoring therapy, it is also important to pay at-
tention to general adolescent health issues, including
healthy life style choices, such as not smoking, con-
traception, and appropriate vaccinations (e.g., human
papillomavirus).
For the induction of puberty, clinicians can use a similar
dose scheme for hypogonadal adolescents with GD/gender
incongruence as they use in other individuals with
hypogonadism, carefully monitoring for desired and un-
desired effects (Table 8). In transgender female adoles-
cents, transdermal 17b-estradiol may be an alternative for
oral 17b-estradiol. It is increasingly used for pubertal
induction in hypogonadal females. However, the absence
of low-dose estrogen patches may be a problem. As a
result, individuals may need to cut patches to size them-
selves to achieve appropriate dosing (123). In transgender
male adolescents, clinicians can give testosterone injections
intramuscularly or subcutaneously (124, 125).
When puberty is initiated with a gradually increasing
schedule of sex steroid doses, the initial levels will not
be high enough to suppress endogenous sex steroid se-
cretion. Gonadotropin secretion and endogenous pro-
duction of testosterone may resume and interfere with
the effectiveness of estrogen treatment, in transgender
female adolescents (126, 127). Therefore, continuation of
GnRH analog treatment is advised until gonadectomy.
Given that GD/gender-incongruent adolescents may opt
not to have gonadectomy, long-term studies are necessary
to examine the potential risks of prolonged GnRH analog
treatment. Alternatively, in transgender male adolescents,
GnRH analog treatment can be discontinued once an
adult dose of testosterone has been reached and the in-
dividual is well virilized. If uterine bleeding occurs, a
progestin can be added. However, the combined use of a
GnRH analog (for ovarian suppression) and testosterone
may enable phenotypic transition with a lower dose of
testosterone in comparison with testosterone alone. If
there is a wish or need to discontinue GnRH analog
treatment in transgender female adolescents, they may be
treated with an antiandrogen that directly suppresses
androgen synthesis or action (see section 3.0 “Hormonal
Therapy for Transgender Adults”).
Values and preferences
The recommendation to initiate pubertal induction
only when the individual has sufficient mental capacity
(roughly age 16 years) to give informed consent for this
partly irreversible treatment places a higher value on the
ability of the adolescent to fully understand and oversee
the partially irreversible consequences of sex hormone
treatment and to give informed consent. It places a lower
value on the possible negative effects of delayed puberty.
We may not currently have the means to weigh ade-
quately the potential benefits of waiting until around age
16 years to initiate sex hormones vs the potential risks/
harm to BMD and the sense of social isolation from
having the timing of puberty be so out of sync with
peers (128).
Remarks
Before starting sex hormone treatment, effects on fer-
tility and options for fertility preservation should be dis-
cussed. Adult height may be a concern in transgender
adolescents. In a transgender female adolescent, clinicians
may consider higher doses of estrogen or a more rapid
tempo of dose escalation during pubertal induction. There
are no established treatments yet to augment adult height
in a transgender male adolescent with open epiphyses
during pubertal induction. It is not uncommon for
transgender adolescents to present for clinical services after
having completed or nearly completed puberty. In such
cases, induction of puberty with sex hormones can be done
more rapidly (see Table 8). Additionally, an adult dose of
testosterone in transgender male adolescents may suffice to
suppress the gonadal axis without the need to use a sep-
arate agent. At the appropriate time, the multidisciplinary
team should adequately prepare the adolescent for tran-
sition to adult care.
3.0 Hormonal Therapy for
Transgender Adults
The two major goals of hormonal therapy are (1) to
reduce endogenous sex hormone levels, and thus reduce
doi: 10.1210/jc.2017-01658
https://academic.oup.com/jcem
3885
Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/jcem/article-abstract/102/11/3869/4157558 by guest on 02 June 2019
 the secondary sex characteristics of the individual’s
designated gender, and (2) to replace endogenous sex
hormone levels consistent with the individual’s gender
identity by using the principles of hormone re-
placement treatment of hypogonadal patients. The
timing of these two goals and the age at which to begin
treatment with the sex hormones of the chosen gender
is codetermined in collaboration with both the person
pursuing transition and the health care providers. The
treatment team should include a medical provider
knowledgeable in transgender hormone therapy, an
MHP knowledgeable in GD/gender incongruence and
the mental health concerns of transition, and a primary
care provider able to provide care appropriate for
transgender individuals. The physical changes in-
duced by this sex hormone transition are usually ac-
companied by an improvement in mental well-being
(129, 130).
3.1. We recommend that clinicians confirm the di-
agnostic criteria of GD/gender incongruence
and the criteria for the endocrine phase of
gender transition before beginning treatment.
(1 |���s)
3.2. We recommend that clinicians evaluate and ad-
dress medical conditions that can be exacerbated
by hormone depletion and treatment with sex
hormones of the affirmed gender before begin-
ning treatment (Table 10). (1 |���s)
3.3. We suggest that clinicians measure hormone
levels during treatment to ensure that endogenous
sex steroids are suppressed and administered sex
steroids are maintained in the normal physiologic
range for the affirmed gender. (2 |��ss)
Evidence
It is the responsibility of the treating clinician to
confirm that the person fulfills criteria for treatment.
The treating clinician should become familiar with the
terms and criteria presented in Tables 1–5 and take a
thorough history from the patient in collaboration with
the other members of the treatment team. The treating
clinician must ensure that the desire for transition is
appropriate; the consequences, risks, and benefits of
treatment are well understood; and the desire for
transition persists. They also need to discuss fertil-
ity preservation options (see recommendation 1.3)
(67, 68).
Transgender males
Clinical studies have demonstrated the efficacy of
several different androgen preparations to induce mas-
culinization in transgender males (Appendix A) (113,
114, 131–134). Regimens to change secondary sex
characteristics follow the general principle of hormone
replacement treatment of male hypogonadism (135).
Clinicians can use either parenteral or transdermal
preparations to achieve testosterone values in the normal
male range (this is dependent on the specific assay, but is
typically 320 to 1000 ng/dL) (Table 11) (136). Sustained
supraphysiologic levels of testosterone increase the risk
of adverse reactions (see section 4.0 “Adverse Out-
come Prevention and Long-Term Care”) and should
be avoided.
Similar to androgen therapy in hypogonadal men,
testosterone treatment in transgender males results in
increased muscle mass and decreased fat mass, increased
facial hair and acne, male pattern baldness in those ge-
netically predisposed, and increased sexual desire (137).

 In transgender males, testosterone will result in clit-
oromegaly, temporary or permanent decreased fertility,
deepening of the voice, cessation of menses (usually),
and a significant increase in body hair, particularly on the
face, chest, and abdomen. Cessation of menses may occur
within a few months with testosterone treatment alone,
although high doses of testosterone may be required. If
uterine bleeding continues, clinicians may consider the
addition of a progestational agent or endometrial abla-
tion (138). Clinicians may also administer GnRH analogs
or depot medroxyprogesterone to stop menses prior to
testosterone treatment.
Transgender females
The hormone regimen for transgender females is more
complex than the transgender male regimen (Appendix
B). Treatment with physiologic doses of estrogen alone is
insufficient to suppress testosterone levels into the normal
range for females (139). Most published clinical studies
report the need for adjunctive therapy to achieve tes-
tosterone levels in the female range (21, 113, 114,
132–134, 139, 140).
Multiple adjunctive medications are available, such as
progestins with antiandrogen activity and GnRH ago-
nists (141). Spironolactone works by directly blocking
androgens during their interaction with the androgen
receptor (114, 133, 142). It may also have estrogenic
activity (143). Cyproterone acetate, a progestational
compound with antiandrogenic properties (113, 132,
144), is widely used in Europe. 5a-Reductase inhibitors
do not reduce testosterone levels and have adverse ef-
fects (145).
Dittrich et al. (141) reported that monthly doses of the
GnRH agonist goserelin acetate in combination with
estrogen were effective in reducing testosterone levels
with a low incidence of adverse reactions in 60 trans-
gender females. Leuprolide and transdermal estrogen
were as effective as cyproterone and transdermal estrogen
in a comparative retrospective study (146).
Patients can take estrogen as oral conjugated estro-
gens, oral 17b-estradiol, or transdermal 17b-estradiol.
Among estrogen options, the increased risk of throm-
boembolic events associated with estrogens in general
seems most concerning with ethinyl estradiol specifically
(134, 140, 141), which is why we specifically suggest that
it not be used in any transgender treatment plan. Data
distinguishing among other estrogen options are less well
established although there is some thought that oral
routes of administration are more thrombogenic due to
the “first pass effect” than are transdermal and paren-
teral routes, and that the risk of thromboembolic events
is dose-dependent. Injectable estrogen and sublingual

 estrogen may benefit from avoiding the first pass effect,
but they can result in more rapid peaks with greater
overall periodicity and thus are more difficult to monitor
(147, 148). However, there are no data demonstrating
that increased periodicity is harmful otherwise.
Clinicians can use serum estradiol levels to monitor
oral, transdermal, and intramuscular estradiol. Blood
tests cannot monitor conjugated estrogens or synthetic
estrogen use. Clinicians should measure serum estra-
diol and serum testosterone and maintain them at the
level for premenopausal females (100 to 200 pg/mL
and ,50 ng/dL, respectively). The transdermal preparations
and injectable estradiol cypionate or valerate preparations
may confer an advantage in older transgender females who
may be at higher risk for thromboembolic disease (149).
Values
Our recommendation to maintain levels of gender-
affirming hormones in the normal adult range places a
high value on the avoidance of the long-term complica-
tions of pharmacologic doses. Those patients receiving
endocrine treatment who have relative contraindications
to hormones should have an in-depth discussion with their
physician to balance the risks and benefits of therapy.
Remarks
Clinicians should inform all endocrine-treated in-
dividuals of all risks and benefits of gender-affirming
hormones prior to initiating therapy. Clinicians should
strongly encourage tobacco use cessation in transgender
females to avoid increased risk of VTE and cardiovas-
cular complications. We strongly discourage the un-
supervised use of hormone therapy (150).
Not all individuals with GD/gender incongruence seek
treatment as described (e.g., male-to-eunuchs and in-
dividuals seeking partial transition). Tailoring current
protocols to the individual may be done within the
context of accepted safety guidelines using a multidisci-
plinary approach including mental health. No evidence-
based protocols are available for these groups (151). We
need prospective studies to better understand treatment
options for these persons.
3.4. We suggest that endocrinologists provide edu-
cation to transgender individuals undergoing
treatment about the onset and time course of
physical changes induced by sex hormone
treatment. (2 |�sss)
Evidence
Transgender males
Physical changes that are expected to occur during
the first 1 to 6 months of testosterone therapy include
cessation of menses, increased sexual desire, increased
facial and body hair, increased oiliness of skin, increased
muscle, and redistribution of fat mass. Changes that
occur within the first year of testosterone therapy include
deepening of the voice (152, 153), clitoromegaly, and
male pattern hair loss (in some cases) (114, 144, 154,
155) (Table 12).
Transgender females
Physical changes that may occur in transgender fe-
males in the first 3 to 12 months of estrogen and anti-
androgen therapy include decreased sexual desire,
decreased spontaneous erections, decreased facial and
body hair (usually mild), decreased oiliness of skin, in-
creased breast tissue growth, and redistribution of fat
mass (114, 139, 149, 154, 155, 161) (Table 13). Breast
development is generally maximal at 2 years after initi-
ating hormones (114, 139, 149, 155). Over a long
period of time, the prostate gland and testicles will
undergo atrophy.
Although the time course of breast development in
transgender females has been studied (150), precise in-
formation about other changes induced by sex hormones
is lacking (141). There is a great deal of variability among
individuals, as evidenced during pubertal development.
We all know that a major concern for transgender fe-
males is breast development. If we work with estro-
gens, the result will be often not what the transgender
female expects.
Alternatively, there are transgender females who re-
port an anecdotal improved breast development, mood,
or sexual desire with the use of progestogens. However,
there have been no well-designed studies of the role of
progestogens in feminizing hormone regimens, so the
question is still open.

 development in transgender females is extremely sparse
and based on the low quality of evidence. Current evi-
dence does not indicate that progestogens enhance breast
development in transgender females, nor does evidence
prove the absence of such an effect. This prevents us from
drawing any firm conclusion at this moment and dem-
onstrates the need for further research to clarify these
important clinical questions (162).
Values and preferences
Transgender persons have very high expectations re-
garding the physical changes of hormone treatment and
are aware that body changes can be enhanced by sur-
gical procedures (e.g., breast, face, and body habitus).
Clear expectations for the extent and timing of sex
hormone–induced changes may prevent the potential
harm and expense of unnecessary procedures.
4.0 Adverse Outcome Prevention and
Long-Term Care
Hormone therapy for transgender males and females
confers many of the same risks associated with sex
hormone replacement therapy in nontransgender per-
sons. The risks arise from and are worsened by in-
advertent or intentional use of supraphysiologic doses of
sex hormones, as well as use of inadequate doses of sex
hormones to maintain normal physiology (131, 139).
4.1. We suggest regular clinical evaluation for phys-
ical changes and potential adverse changes in
response to sex steroid hormones and laboratory
monitoring of sex steroid hormone levels every
3 months during the first year of hormone
therapy for transgender males and females and
then once or twice yearly. (2 |��ss)
Evidence
Pretreatment screening and appropriate regular
medical monitoring are recommended for both trans-
gender males and females during the endocrine transition
and periodically thereafter (26, 155). Clinicians should
monitor weight and blood pressure, conduct physical
exams, and assess routine health questions, such as to-
bacco use, symptoms of depression, and risk of adverse
events such as deep vein thrombosis/pulmonary embo-
lism and other adverse effects of sex steroids.
Transgender males
Table 14 contains a standard monitoring plan for
transgender males on testosterone therapy (154, 159).
Key issues include maintaining testosterone levels in the
physiologic normal male range and avoiding adverse
events resulting from excess testosterone therapy, par-
ticularly erythrocytosis, sleep apnea, hypertension, ex-
cessive weight gain, salt retention, lipid changes, and
excessive or cystic acne (135).
Because oral 17-alkylated testosterone is not recom-
mended, serious hepatic toxicity is not anticipated with
parenteral or transdermal testosterone use (163, 164).
Past concerns regarding liver toxicity with testosterone
have been alleviated with subsequent reports that indicate
the risk of serious liver disease is minimal (144, 165, 166).
Transgender females
Table 15 contains a standard monitoring plan for
transgender females on estrogens, gonadotropin suppres-
sion, or antiandrogens (160). Key issues include avoiding
supraphysiologic doses or blood levels of estrogen that may
lead to increased risk for thromboembolic disease, liver
dysfunction, and hypertension. Clinicians should monitor
serum estradiol levels using laboratories participating in
external quality control, as measurements of estradiol in
blood can be very challenging (167).
VTE may be a serious complication. A study re-
ported a 20-fold increase in venous thromboembolic
disease in a large cohort of Dutch transgender subjects
(161). This increase may have been associated with the use
of the synthetic estrogen, ethinyl estradiol (149). The in-
cidence decreased when clinicians stopped administering
ethinyl estradiol (161). Thus, the use of synthetic estrogens
and conjugated estrogens is undesirable because of the
inability to regulate doses by measuring serum levels and
the risk of thromboembolic disease. In a German gender
clinic, deep vein thrombosis occurred in 1 of 60 of
transgender females treated with a GnRH analog and oral

 estradiol (141). The patient who developed a deep vein
thrombosis was found to have a homozygous C677 T
mutation in the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase
gene. In an Austrian gender clinic, administering gender-
affirming hormones to 162 transgender females and 89
transgender males was not associated with VTE, despite
an 8.0% and 5.6% incidence of thrombophilia (159). A
more recent multinational study reported only 10 cases
of VTE from a cohort of 1073 subjects (168). Throm-
bophilia screening of transgender persons initiating
hormone treatment should be restricted to those with
a personal or family history of VTE (159). Monitor-
ing
D-dimer levels during treatment is not recom-
mended (169).
4.2. We suggest periodically monitoring prolactin
levels in transgender females treated with estro-
gens. (2 |��ss)
Evidence
Estrogen therapy can increase the growth of pituitary
lactrotroph cells. There have been several reports of
prolactinomas occurring after long-term, high-dose
estrogen therapy (170–173). Up to 20% of transgender
females treated with estrogens may have elevations in
prolactin levels associated with enlargement of the pi-
tuitary gland (156). In most cases, the serum prolactin
levels will return to the normal range with a reduction or
discontinuation of the estrogen therapy or discontinua-
tion of cyproterone acetate (157, 174, 175).
The onset and time course of hyperprolactinemia
during estrogen treatment are not known. Clinicians
should measure prolactin levels at baseline and then at
least annually during the transition period and every 2
years thereafter. Given that only a few case studies
reported prolactinomas, and prolactinomas were not
reported in large cohorts of estrogen-treated persons,
the risk is likely to be very low. Because the major
presenting findings of microprolactinomas (hypo-
gonadism and sometimes gynecomastia) are not ap-
parent in transgender females, clinicians may perform
radiologic examinations of the pituitary in those pa-
tients whose prolactin levels persistently increase
despite stable or reduced estrogen levels. Some trans-
gender individuals receive psychotropic medications that
can increase prolactin levels (174).
Table 14.
Monitoring of Transgender Persons on Gender-Affirming Hormone Therapy: Transgender Male
1. Evaluate patient every 3 mo in the first year and then one to two times per year to monitor for appropriate signs of virilization and for
development of adverse reactions.
2. Measure serum testosterone every 3 mo until levels are in the normal physiologic male range:a
a. For testosterone enanthate/cypionate injections, the testosterone level should be measured midway between injections. The target
level is 400–700 ng/dL to 400 ng/dL. Alternatively, measure peak and trough levels to ensure levels remain in the normal male range.
b. For parenteral testosterone undecanoate, testosterone should be measured just before the following injection. If the level is
,400 ng/dL, adjust dosing interval.
c. For transdermal testosterone, the testosterone level can be measured no sooner than after 1 wk of daily application (at least 2 h after
application).
3. Measure hematocrit or hemoglobin at baseline and every 3 mo for the first year and then one to two times a year. Monitor weight,
blood pressure, and lipids at regular intervals.
4. Screening for osteoporosis should be conducted in those who stop testosterone treatment, are not compliant with hormone therapy,
or who develop risks for bone loss.
5. If cervical tissue is present, monitoring as recommended by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.
6. Ovariectomy can be considered after completion of hormone transition.
7. Conduct sub- and periareolar annual breast examinations if mastectomy performed. If mastectomy is not performed, then consider
mammograms as recommended by the American Cancer Society.

2. Measure serum testosterone and estradiol every 3 mo.
a. Serum testosterone levels should be ,50 ng/dL.
b. Serum estradiol should not exceed the peak physiologic range: 100–200 pg/mL.
3. For individuals on spironolactone, serum electrolytes, particularly potassium, should be monitored every 3 mo in the first year and
annually thereafter.
4. Routine cancer screening is recommended, as in nontransgender individuals (all tissues present).
5. Consider BMD testing at baseline (160). In individuals at low risk, screening for osteoporosis should be conducted at age 60 years or in
those who are not compliant with hormone therapy.

 4.3. We suggest that clinicians evaluate transgender
persons treated with hormones for cardiovas-
cular risk factors using fasting lipid profiles, di-
abetes screening, and/or other diagnostic tools.
(2 |��ss)
Evidence
Transgender males
Administering testosterone to transgender males re-
sults in a more atherogenic lipid profile with lowered
high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and higher tri-
glyceride and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol values
(176–179). Studies of the effect of testosterone on insulin
sensitivity have mixed results (178, 180). A randomized,
open-label uncontrolled safety study of transgender
males treated with testosterone undecanoate demon-
strated no insulin resistance after 1 year (181, 182).
Numerous studies have demonstrated the effects of sex
hormone treatment on the cardiovascular system (160,
179, 183, 184). Long-term studies from The Netherlands
found no increased risk for cardiovascular mortality
(161). Likewise, a meta-analysis of 19 randomized trials
in nontransgender males on testosterone replacement
showed no increased incidence of cardiovascular events
(185). A systematic review of the literature found that
data were insufficient (due to very low–quality evidence)
to allow a meaningful assessment of patient-important
outcomes, such as death, stroke, myocardial infarction,
or VTE in transgender males (176). Future research is
needed to ascertain the potential harm of hormonal
therapies (176). Clinicians should manage cardiovascular
risk factors as they emerge according to established
guidelines (186).
Transgender females
A prospective study of transgender females found
favorable changes in lipid parameters with increased
high-density lipoprotein and decreased low-density li-
poprotein concentrations (178). However, increased
weight, blood pressure, and markers of insulin resis-
tance attenuated these favorable lipid changes. In a
meta-analysis, only serum triglycerides were higher
at $24 months without changes in other parameters
(187). The largest cohort of transgender females (mean
age 41 years, followed for a mean of 10 years) showed no
increase in cardiovascular mortality despite a 32% rate of
tobacco use (161).
Thus, there is limited evidence to determine whether
estrogen is protective or detrimental on lipid and glucose
metabolism in transgender females (176). With aging,
there is usually an increase of body weight. Therefore,
as with nontransgender individuals, clinicians should
monitor and manage glucose and lipid metabolism
and blood pressure regularly according to established
guidelines (186).
4.4. We recommend that clinicians obtain BMD
measurements when risk factors for osteoporosis
exist, specifically in those who stop sex hormone
therapy after gonadectomy. (1 |��ss)
Evidence
Transgender males
Baseline bone mineral measurements in transgender
males are generally in the expected range for their pre-
treatment gender (188). However, adequate dosing of
testosterone is important to maintain bone mass in
transgender males (189, 190). In one study (190), serum
LH levels were inversely related to BMD, suggesting that
low levels of sex hormones were associated with bone
loss. Thus, LH levels in the normal range may serve as an
indicator of the adequacy of sex steroid administration to
preserve bone mass. The protective effect of testosterone
may be mediated by peripheral conversion to estradiol,
both systemically and locally in the bone.
Transgender females
A baseline study of BMD reported T scores less
than 22.5 in 16% of transgender females (191). In aging
males, studies suggest that serum estradiol more posi-
tively correlates with BMD than does testosterone (192,
193) and is more important for peak bone mass (194).
Estrogen preserves BMD in transgender females who
continue on estrogen and antiandrogen therapies (188,
190, 191, 195, 196).
Fracture data in transgender males and females are
not available. Transgender persons who have undergone
gonadectomy may choose not to continue consistent sex
steroid treatment after hormonal and surgical sex reas-
signment, thereby becoming at risk for bone loss. There
have been no studies to determine whether clinicians
should use the sex assigned at birth or affirmed gender for
assessing osteoporosis (e.g., when using the FRAX tool).
Although some researchers use the sex assigned at birth
(with the assumption that bone mass has usually peaked
for transgender people who initiate hormones in early
adulthood), this should be assessed on a case-by-case
basis until there are more data available. This assumption
will be further complicated by the increasing prevalence
of transgender people who undergo hormonal transition
at a pubertal age or soon after puberty. Sex for com-
parison within risk assessment tools may be based on the
age at which hormones were initiated and the length
of exposure to hormones. In some cases, it may be

 reasonable to assess risk using both the male and female
calculators and using an intermediate value. Because all
subjects underwent normal pubertal development, with
known effects on bone size, reference values for birth sex
were used for all participants (154).
4.5. We suggest that transgender females with no
known increased risk of breast cancer follow
breast-screening guidelines recommended for
those designated female at birth. (2 |��ss)
4.6. We suggest that transgender females treated
with estrogens follow individualized screening
according to personal risk for prostatic disease
and prostate cancer. (2 |�sss)
Evidence
Studies have reported a few cases of breast cancer in
transgender females (197–200). A Dutch study of 1800
transgender females followed for a mean of 15 years
(range of 1 30 years) found one case of breast cancer. The
Women’s Health Initiative study reported that females
taking conjugated equine estrogen without progesterone
for 7 years did not have an increased risk of breast cancer
as compared with females taking placebo (137).
In transgender males, a large retrospective study
conducted at the U.S. Veterans Affairs medical health
system identified seven breast cancers (194). The authors
reported that this was not above the expected rate of
breast cancers in cisgender females in this cohort. Fur-
thermore, they did report one breast cancer that de-
veloped in a transgender male patient after mastectomy,
supporting the fact that breast cancer can occur even
after mastectomy. Indeed, there have been case reports
of breast cancer developing in subareolar tissue in
transgender males, which occurred after mastectomy
(201, 202).
Women with primary hypogonadism (Turner syn-
drome) treated with estrogen replacement exhibited a
significantly decreased incidence of breast cancer as
compared with national standardized incidence ratios
(203, 204). These studies suggest that estrogen therapy
does not increase the risk of breast cancer in the short
term (,20 to 30 years). We need long-term studies to
determine the actual risk, as well as the role of screening
mammograms. Regular examinations and gynecologic
advice should determine monitoring for breast cancer.
Prostate cancer is very rare before the age of 40,
especially with androgen deprivation therapy (205).
Childhood or pubertal castration results in regression of
the prostate and adult castration reverses benign prostate
hypertrophy (206). Although van Kesteren et al. (207)
reported that estrogen therapy does not induce hyper-
trophy or premalignant changes in the prostates of
transgender females, studies have reported cases of be-
nign prostatic hyperplasia in transgender females treated
with estrogens for 20 to 25 years (208, 209). Studies have
also reported a few cases of prostate carcinoma in
transgender females (210–214).
Transgender females may feel uncomfortable sched-
uling regular prostate examinations. Gynecologists are
not trained to screen for prostate cancer or to monitor
prostate growth. Thus, it may be reasonable for trans-
gender females who transitioned after age 20 years to have
annual screening digital rectal examinations after age
50 years and prostate-specific antigen tests consistent
with U.S. Preventive Services Task Force Guidelines
(215).
4.7. We advise that clinicians determine the medical
necessity of including a total hysterectomy and
oophorectomy as part of gender-affirming sur-
gery. (Ungraded Good Practice Statement)
Evidence
Although aromatization of testosterone to estradiol in
transgender males has been suggested as a risk factor for
endometrial cancer (216), no cases have been reported.
When transgender males undergo hysterectomy, the
uterus is small and there is endometrial atrophy (217,
218). Studies have reported cases of ovarian cancer (219,
220). Although there is limited evidence for increased risk
of reproductive tract cancers in transgender males, health
care providers should determine the medical necessity of
a laparoscopic total hysterectomy as part of a gender-
affirming surgery to prevent reproductive tract can-
cer (221).
Values
Given the discomfort that transgender males experi-
ence accessing gynecologic care, our recommendation for
the medical necessity of total hysterectomy and oopho-
rectomy places a high value on eliminating the risks of
female reproductive tract disease and cancer and a lower
value on avoiding the risks of these surgical procedures
(related to the surgery and to the potential undesir-
able health consequences of oophorectomy) and their
associated costs.
Remarks
The sexual orientation and type of sexual practices will
determine the need and types of gynecologic care required
following transition. Additionally, in certain countries,
the approval required to change the sex in a birth cer-
tificate for transgender males may be dependent on
having a complete hysterectomy. Clinicians should help
patients research nonmedical administrative criteria and

 provide counseling. If individuals decide not to undergo
hysterectomy, screening for cervical cancer is the same as
all other females.
5.0 Surgery for Sex Reassignment and
Gender Confirmation
For many transgender adults, genital gender-affirming
surgery may be the necessary step toward achieving their
ultimate goal of living successfully in their desired gender
role. The type of surgery falls into two main categories:
(1) those that directly affect fertility and (2) those that do
not. Those that change fertility (previously called sex
reassignment surgery) include genital surgery to remove
the penis and gonads in the male and removal of the
uterus and gonads in the female. The surgeries that effect
fertility are often governed by the legal system of the state
or country in which they are performed. Other gender-
conforming surgeries that do not directly affect fertility
are not so tightly governed.
Gender-affirming surgical techniques have improved
markedly during the past 10 years. Reconstructive genital
surgery that preserves neurologic sensation is now the
standard. The satisfaction rate with surgical reassignment
of sex is now very high (187). Additionally, the mental
health of the individual seems to be improved by par-
ticipating in a treatment program that defines a pathway
of gender-affirming treatment that includes hormones
and surgery (130, 144) (Table 16).
Surgery that affects fertility is irreversible. The World
Professional Association for Transgender Health Stan-
dards of Care (222) emphasizes that the “threshold of 18
should not be seen as an indication in itself for active
intervention.” If the social transition has not been sat-
isfactory, if the person is not satisfied with or is ambiv-
alent about the effects of sex hormone treatment, or if the
person is ambivalent about surgery then the individual
should not be referred for surgery (223, 224).
Gender-affirming genital surgeries for transgender
females that affect fertility include gonadectomy,
penectomy, and creation of a neovagina (225, 226).
Surgeons often invert the skin of the penis to form the
wall of the vagina, and several literatures reviews have
reported on outcomes (227). Sometimes there is in-
adequate tissue to form a full neovagina, so clinicians
have revisited using intestine and found it to be successful
(87, 228, 229). Some newer vaginoplasty techniques may
involve autologuous oral epithelial cells (230, 231).
The scrotum becomes the labia majora. Surgeons
use reconstructive surgery to fashion the clitoris and
its hood, preserving the neurovascular bundle at the
tip of the penis as the neurosensory supply to the
clitoris. Some surgeons are also creating a sensate
pedicled-spot adding a G spot to the neovagina to
increase sensation (232). Most recently, plastic sur-
geons have developed techniques to fashion labia
minora. To further complete the feminization, uterine
transplants have been proposed and even attempted
(233).
Neovaginal prolapse, rectovaginal fistula, delayed
healing, vaginal stenosis, and other complications do
sometimes occur (234, 235). Clinicians should strongly
remind the transgender person to use their dilators to
maintain the depth and width of the vagina throughout
the postoperative period. Genital sexual responsivity and
other aspects of sexual function are usually preserved
following genital gender-affirming surgery (236, 237).
Ancillary surgeries for more feminine or masculine
appearance are not within the scope of this guideline.
Voice therapy by a speech language pathologist is
available to transform speech patterns to the affirmed
gender (148). Spontaneous voice deepening occurs dur-
ing testosterone treatment of transgender males (152,
238). No studies have compared the effectiveness
of speech therapy, laryngeal surgery, or combined
treatment.
Breast surgery is a good example of gender-confirming
surgery that does not affect fertility. In all females, breast
size exhibits a very broad spectrum. For transgender
females to make the best informed decision, clinicians
should delay breast augmentation surgery until the pa-
tient has completed at least 2 years of estrogen therapy,
because the breasts continue to grow during that time
(141, 155).
Another major procedure is the removal of facial and
masculine-appearing body hair using either electrolysis or
Table 16.
Criteria for Gender-Affirming Surgery, Which Affects Fertility
1. Persistent, well-documented gender dysphoria
2. Legal age of majority in the given country
3. Having continuously and responsibly used gender-affirming hormones for 12 mo (if there is no medical contraindication to receiving
such therapy)
4. Successful continuous full-time living in the new gender role for 12 mo
5. If significant medical or mental health concerns are present, they must be well controlled
6. Demonstrable knowledge of all practical aspects of surgery (e.g., cost, required lengths of hospitalizations, likely complications,
postsurgical rehabilitation)

 laser treatments. Other feminizing surgeries, such as that
to feminize the face, are now becoming more popular
(239–241).
In
transgender
males,
clinicians
usually
delay
gender-affirming genital surgeries until after a few
years of androgen therapy. Those surgeries that affect
fertility in this group include oophorectomy, vagi-
nectomy, and complete hysterectomy. Surgeons can
safely perform them vaginally with laparoscopy. These
are sometimes done in conjunction with the creation
of a neopenis. The cosmetic appearance of a neopenis is
now very good, but the surgery is multistage and very
expensive (242, 243). Radial forearm flap seems to be
the most satisfactory procedure (228, 244). Other flaps
also exist (245). Surgeons can make neopenile erections
possible by reinervation of the flap and subsequent
contraction of the muscle, leading to stiffening of the
neopenis (246, 247), but results are inconsistent (248).
Surgeons can also stiffen the penis by imbedding some
mechanical device (e.g., a rod or some inflatable ap-
paratus) (249, 250). Because of these limitations, the
creation of a neopenis has often been less than satis-
factory. Recently, penis transplants are being pro-
posed (233).
In fact, most transgender males do not have any
external genital surgery because of the lack of access,
high cost, and significant potential complications. Some
choose a metaoidioplasty that brings forward the cli-
toris, thereby allowing them to void in a standing po-
sition without wetting themselves (251, 252). Surgeons
can create the scrotum from the labia majora with good
cosmetic effect and can implant testicular prosthe-
ses (253).
The most important masculinizing surgery for the
transgender male is mastectomy, and it does not affect
fertility. Breast size only partially regresses with androgen
therapy (155). In adults, discussions about mastectomy
usually take place after androgen therapy has started.
Because some transgender male adolescents present after
significant breast development has occurred, they may
also consider mastectomy 2 years after they begin an-
drogen therapy and before age 18 years. Clinicians
should individualize treatment based on the physical and
mental health status of the individual. There are now
newer approaches to mastectomy with better outcomes
(254, 255). These often involve chest contouring (256).
Mastectomy is often necessary for living comfortably in
the new gender (256).
5.1. We recommend that a patient pursue genital
gender-affirming surgery only after the MHP and
the clinician responsible for endocrine transition
therapy both agree that surgery is medically
necessary and would benefit the patient’s overall
health and/or well-being. (1 |��ss)
5.2. We advise that clinicians approve genital gender-
affirming surgery only after completion of at least
1 year of consistent and compliant hormone
treatment, unless hormone therapy is not desired
or medically contraindicated. (Ungraded Good
Practice Statement)
5.3. We advise that the clinician responsible for en-
docrine treatment and the primary care provider
ensure appropriate medical clearance of trans-
gender individuals for genital gender-affirming
surgery and collaborate with the surgeon re-
garding hormone use during and after surgery.
(Ungraded Good Practice Statement)
5.4. We recommend that clinicians refer hormone-
treated transgender individuals for genital
surgery when: (1) the individual has had a sat-
isfactory social role change, (2) the individual is
satisfied about the hormonal effects, and (3) the
individual desires definitive surgical changes.
(1 |�sss)
5.5. We suggest that clinicians delay gender-affirming
genital surgery involving gonadectomy and/or
hysterectomy until the patient is at least 18
years old or legal age of majority in his or her
country. (2 |��ss).
5.6. We suggest that clinicians determine the timing of
breast surgery for transgender males based upon
the physical and mental health status of the in-
dividual. There is insufficient evidence to rec-
ommend a specific age requirement. (2 |�sss)
Evidence
Owing to the lack of controlled studies, incomplete
follow-up, and lack of valid assessment measures,
evaluating various surgical approaches and techniques
is difficult. However, one systematic review including a
large numbers of studies reported satisfactory cosmetic
and functional results for vaginoplasty/neovagina con-
struction (257). For transgender males, the outcomes are
less certain. However, the problems are now better
understood (258). Several postoperative studies report
significant long-term psychological and psychiatric
pathology (259–261). One study showed satisfaction
with breasts, genitals, and femininity increased signifi-
cantly and showed the importance of surgical treatment
as a key therapeutic option for transgender females
(262). Another analysis demonstrated that, despite the
young average age at death following surgery and the
relatively larger number of individuals with somatic
morbidity, the study does not allow for determination of

Guidelines on Gender-Dysphoric/Gender-Incongruent Persons

 causal relationships between, for example, specific types
of hormonal or surgical treatment received and somatic
morbidity and mortality (263). Reversal surgery in
regretful male-to-female transsexuals after sexual
reassignment surgery represents a complex, multistage
procedure with satisfactory outcomes. Further insight
into the characteristics of persons who regret their de-
cision postoperatively would facilitate better future se-
lection of applicants eligible for sexual reassignment
surgery. We need more studies with appropriate controls
that examine long-term quality of life, psychosocial
outcomes, and psychiatric outcomes to determine the
long-term benefits of surgical treatment.
When a transgender individual decides to have gender-
affirming surgery, both the hormone prescribing clinician
and the MHP must certify that the patient satisfies criteria
for gender-affirming surgery (Table 16).
There is some concern that estrogen therapy may
cause an increased risk for venous thrombosis during or
following surgery (176). For this reason, the surgeon
and the hormone-prescribing clinician should collabo-
rate in making a decision about the use of hormones
before and following surgery. One study suggests that
preoperative factors (such as compliance) are less im-
portant for patient satisfaction than are the physical
postoperative results (56). However, other studies and
clinical experience dictate that individuals who do not
follow medical instructions and do not work with their
physicians toward a common goal do not achieve
treatment goals (264) and experience higher rates of
postoperative infections and other complications (265,
266). It is also important that the person requesting
surgery feels comfortable with the anatomical changes
that have occurred during hormone therapy. Dissatis-
faction with social and physical outcomes during the
hormone transition may be a contraindication to sur-
gery (223).
An endocrinologist or experienced medical provider
should monitor transgender individuals after surgery.
Those who undergo gonadectomy will require hormone
replacement therapy, surveillance, or both to prevent
adverse effects of chronic hormone deficiency.
