T
he incidence of oropharyngeal cancer has increased over 
the past 2 decades.1–3 This rise has largely been attrib-
uted to oncogenic human papillomavirus (HPV), yet 
many population-based studies have been limited to using ana-
tomic subsites as an indicator for “HPV-associated” cancer.4–7 
Patients with HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancer have consis-
tently had better survival than those with HPV-negative oro-
pharyngeal cancer.8 Because of the high rates of response to 
treatment, therapy that is less intense may reduce treatment-
related toxicity without detrimentally affecting outcomes.9,10 On 
this basis, HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancer is considered a 
distinct form of head and neck cancer.11 To evaluate the chang-
ing burden of HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancer in Canada, 
its changing incidence should be estimated accurately.
Systematic testing of all available oropharyngeal tumours for 
HPV status has become routine practice in some centres, but not 
across Canada. Selected testing was the norm from 2000 to 2012. 
Failing to account for testing selection bias can result in inaccur-
ate estimates of HPV positivity. In this study, we attempted to 
address this knowledge gap by using data obtained from several 
major centres across Canada to analyze all patients with oro-
pharyngeal cancer and assess rates of HPV-associated cancer.

ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND: The incidence of oro-
pharyngeal cancer has risen over the 
past 2 decades. This rise has been 
attributed to human papillomavirus 
(HPV), but information on temporal 
trends in incidence of HPV-associated 
cancers across Canada is limited. 
METHODS: We collected social, clinical 
and demographic characteristics and 
p16 protein status (p16-positive or 
p16-negative, using this immunohisto-
chemistry variable as a surrogate 
marker of HPV status) for 3643 patients 
with oropharyngeal cancer diagnosed 
between 2000 and 2012 at comprehen-
sive cancer centres in British Columbia 
(6 centres), Edmonton, Calgary, Toronto 
and Halifax. We used receiver operating 
characteristic curves and multiple impu-
tation to estimate the p16 status for 
missing values. We chose a best-imputa-
tion probability cut point on the basis of 
accuracy in samples with known p16 
status and through an independent 
relation between p16 status and overall 
survival. We used logistic and Cox pro-
portional hazard regression.
RESULTS: We found no temporal 
changes in p16-positive status initially, 
but there was significant selection bias, 
with p16 testing significantly more likely 
to be performed in males, lifetime 
never-smokers, patients with tonsillar 
or base-of-tongue tumours and those 
with nodal involvement (p < 0.05 for 
each variable). We used the following 
variables associated with p16-positive 
status for multiple imputation: male 
sex, tonsillar or base-of-tongue tumours, 
smaller tumours, nodal involvement, 
less smoking and lower alcohol con-
sumption (p < 0.05 for each variable). 
Using sensitivity analyses, we showed 
that different imputation probability cut 
points for p16-positive status each iden-
tified a rise from 2000 to 2012, with the 
best-probability cut point identifying an 
increase from 47.3% in 2000 to 73.7% in 
2012 (p < 0.001).
INTERPRETATION: Across multiple cen-
tres in Canada, there was a steady rise 
in the proportion of oropharyngeal can-
cers attributable to HPV from 2000 to 
2012.

Methods
Patient population
Adult patients 18 years of age or older with squamous cell oro-
pharyngeal cancer diagnosed from 2000 to 2012 were included 
(International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related 
Health Problems, 10th revision [ICD-10], codes C01, C05.1, C05.2 
and C10). To minimize the potential for selection bias, we 
included all patients with oropharyngeal cancer and not just 
those who had HPV testing results. Following an email request 
for centres across Canada to join the study, data were supplied 
by 5 Canadian cancer organizations: the Princess Margaret Can-
cer Centre (Toronto); the British Columbia Cancer Agency, which 
consists of 6 regional cancer centres; the Tom Baker Cancer 
Centre (Calgary), the Cross Cancer Institute (Edmonton) and the 
Nova Scotia Cancer Centre (Halifax; at the time of the study, this 
centre covered all of Nova Scotia). Systematic (routine) reflex 
HPV testing started in 2008 in Calgary, 2009 in Halifax, mid-2009 
in Toronto, 2010 in Edmonton and 2015 in British Columbia. 
Data collection
We developed a single prospective, electronic database with an 
associated data dictionary, based on an existing database,1 to 
allow all centres to capture information uniformly. We reviewed 
electronic medical records and data from institutional regis-
tries to obtain clinical and demographic characteristics: age at 
diagnosis, sex, marital status, body mass index, year of diagno-
sis, anatomic subsite, clinical staging, primary treatment, 
smoking status and alcohol consumption (as defined previ-
ously1). The frequency of missing data is presented in Appen-
dix 1 (available at www.cmaj.ca/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1503/
cmaj.161379/-/DC1).
p16 protein immunohistochemistry was used as a surrogate 
for HPV status, and results were dichotomized as p16-positive 
or p16-negative.12–15 Details on p16 testing can be found in 
Appendix 2 (available at www.cmaj.ca/lookup/suppl/doi 
:10.1503/cmaj.161379/-/DC1). p16 immunohistochemistry is a 
validated method to measure HPV status in oropharyngeal 
cancer.12,13,16
Statistical analysis
We used multivariable logistic regression to determine which fac-
tors were associated with p16 testing (tested v. untested) and 
p16 status among those tested (p16-positive v. p16-negative); 
these factors would form the basis of a predictive model used as 
a first step in imputation. We calculated odds ratios (ORs) with 
95% confidence intervals (CIs) for each factor. We then devel-
oped a predictive model based on the factors associated with 
p16 status, in preparation for multiple imputation of missing p16 
data. We assessed the ability of the logistic regression model to 
predict p16 status using receiver operating characteristic curves, 
and compared areas under the curve between models using the 
C statistic (with 95% CI). 
We performed overall survival analyses using Cox propor-
tional hazard regression, presented with hazard ratios (HRs) and 
Kaplan–Meier plots. All multivariable models included the fol-
lowing covariables unless otherwise specified: age at diagnosis, 
sex, anatomic subsite (tonsil, base of tongue, other), tumour 
classification (T1–T4), nodal classification (N0–N3), smoking sta-
tus (current, former, never), smoking pack-years and alcohol 
consumption (none/light, moderate/heavy). We stratified the 
data by the city or province of diagnosis, where appropriate.
Multiple imputation
Because we did not wish to limit our analysis to only those 
patients with results from HPV testing, we used multiple impu-
tation to derive HPV status for patients with missing test 
results. Multiple imputation was conducted using the variables 
that resulted in the best predictive model for p16 status (using 
the C statistics described above). Following 100 imputations, 
the number of times that each patient was classified as 
p16-positive was referred to as the probability of p16-positive 
status or Pr(p16+). To classify patients as p16-positive or 
p16-negative, we defined a cut point of Pr(p16+) using leave-
one-out cross-validation and survival analyses (an overview of 
the method is presented in Appendix 3, available at www.cmaj.
ca/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1503/cmaj.161379/-/DC1). The distri-
bution of Pr(p16+) was categorized into quintiles (Q1–Q5), and 
overall survival was compared with patients whose p16 status 
was known. Data from patients with known p16 status (the 
leave-one-out validation subset, n = 1282) were used to assess 
the accuracy of various Pr(p16+) cut points (Appendix 4, avail-
able at www.cmaj.ca/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1503/cmaj 
.161379/-/DC1). 
Time trends were determined using the year of diagnosis as 
the only predictor. We assessed overall survival by p16 status 
because we wanted to use survival characteristics as a method of 
externally assessing the appropriateness of our planned multiple 
imputation (i.e., because HPV status affects survival, imputed 
HPV status should affect survival in a similar fashion). The overall 
survival of patients with oropharyngeal cancer by p16 status was 
evaluated in the Toronto, Alberta (Edmonton and Calgary com-
bined) and Halifax data sets, where reasonable proportions of 
patients’ tumours underwent p16 testing. 
Sensitivity analysis
Although imputation would allow generation of the change in the 
proportion of p16-positive patients over time with less missing-
ness bias, assumptions associated with multiple imputation 
meant additional sensitivity analyses were necessary. We evalu-
ated the sensitivity of time trends to differences in how p16 status 
was defined. The Pr(p16+) was plotted over time as both a contin-
uous probability and as a proportion when patients were classified 
(dichotomized) with 85% sensitivity. We performed further analy-
ses stratifying by province. These statistical procedures, as well as 
those described above, were performed using SAS version 9.4 (SAS 
Institute Inc.).
Ethics approval
Ethics approval was obtained from each institution’s research 
ethics board, and the data were de-identified before being 
placed in the central database.

Results
Patient population
Of 3643 patients with oropharyngeal cancer, the mean follow-up 
time was 2.6 (standard deviation 2.3) years. Although the various 
centres each contributed data for a different period between 
2000 and 2012, patients with oropharyngeal cancer had similar 
characteristics across centres (Table 1). Data from the 2 Alberta 
centres, which together covered the whole province, were com-
bined for some of the subsequent analyses. 
p16 testing and testing bias over time
p16 status was available from Toronto (n = 971 [57%]), Calgary 
(n = 159 [40%]), Edmonton (n = 94 [28%]) and Halifax (n = 45 
[37%]), and the result was positive for most cases tested (74%; 
Table 1). Testing rates increased over time at all centres 
(Appendix 5, panel A, available at www.cmaj.ca/lookup/suppl/
doi:10.1503/cmaj.161379/-/DC1). Most recently, 88% of oropha-
ryngeal cancers in Toronto were tested in 2012, 91% in Edmon-
ton in 2012 and 94% in Calgary in 2011 (Appendix 5, panel A). 
Despite routine testing in Halifax after 2009, p16 testing was 
unavailable for many patients; in these patients, the diagnosis 
was made from a fine-needle aspirate, which is not suitable for 
p16 staining.
In univariable analyses, p16 testing was more likely to occur 
if patients were younger, were male, had tumours of the tonsil 
or base of the tongue, never smoked, had fewer pack-years, 
had less alcohol consumption and had some nodal involvement 
(p < 0.05 for all; see Appendix 6, available at www.cmaj.ca/
lookup/suppl/doi:10.1503/cmaj.161379/-/DC1). After adjust-
ment, p16 testing was more likely to be performed in males, 
lifetime never-smokers, patients with tonsillar or base-of-
tongue tumours and those with nodal involvement. Over time, 
testing for p16 status became less discriminatory by sex and 
tumour stage, yet some residual bias may have remained 
(Appendix 5, panels B to F)
Using a complete-case analysis, we observed no temporal 
change in the proportion of p16-positive cases of oropharyngeal 
cancer (Appendix 7, available at www.cmaj.ca/lookup/suppl/
doi:10.1503/cmaj.161379/-/DC1).

Modelling of p16 status
Given the documented testing bias, we attempted to assign p16 
status to untested patients using multiple imputation. Factors 
associated with p16-positive status included being younger, 
being male, having a tonsillar or base-of-tongue tumour, having 
lower tumour stage and any nodal involvement, lack of smoking 
history and lower alcohol consumption (none/light). These anal-
yses were restricted to the Toronto and Alberta subsets because 
of the model’s sample size constraints (Table 2).
The ability of social, demographic and clinical factors to predict 
p16 status is presented in Figure 1. The models that included age at 
diagnosis, sex, tumour classification, nodal classification, anatomic 
subsite, smoking status, smoking pack-years and alcohol consump-
tion resulted in the highest C statistics (area under the curve). Nei-
ther body mass index (available only for Alberta patients) nor the 
Charlson comorbidity index improved the predictive ability of the 
models. Because of the small absolute number of patients from 
Halifax, a predictive model was not applied to this population.
Overall survival by p16 status
p16-negative status was consistently associated with worse over-
all survival in all centres. Overall survival of patients with oropha-
ryngeal cancer by p16 status for the Toronto, Alberta and Halifax 
data sets is presented in Figure 2. According to a Cox propor-

tional hazards regression model (stratified by province), the fac-
tors associated with poorer overall survival were older age, hav-
ing a nontonsillar tumour, current smoking and having more 
advanced disease (Table 3). Even after adjustment for these fac-
tors, patients with p16-negative tumours had twice the risk of 
death relative to p16-positive patients.
Following multiple imputation, movement down each quin-
tile of Pr(p16+), where Q5 was most likely to be p16-positive and 
Q1 was least likely to be p16-positive, was associated with an 
increase in mortality risk, with adjusted HR 1.58 (95% CI 1.51–
1.66) per change in quintile (Figure 3A). 
The optimal cut point (which maximized sensitivity and speci-
ficity) underestimated the p16-positive proportion of the valida-
tion subset (time 0; Appendix 8, available at www.cmaj.ca/lookup/
suppl/ doi:10.1503/cmaj.161379/-/DC1). However, lowering the 
Pr(p16+) cut point to yield a sensitivity of 85% resulted in nearly 
identical Kaplan–Meier plots between imputed and known p16 
status in both the p16-positive and p16-negative strata, with 71% 
of the validation cohort being classified as p16-positive (Figure 3B, 
time 0). This cut point corresponded to Pr(p16+) = 68.7% and was 
used to categorize patients as p16-positive or p16-negative. 
Sensitivity analyses
Under the continuous definition, the Pr(p16+) increased over 
time, from 61.8% in 2000 to 76.4% by 2012 (p < 0.001). When 
dichotomized (at the 85% sensitivity cut point definition), the 
proportion of p16-positive patients rose from 47.3% in 2000 to 
73.7% in 2012 (p < 0.001) (Figure 4A).

tion of p16-positive patients ranged from 71.0% (90% specificity) 
to 76.4% (continuous probability). Similar results were obtained 
in a sensitivity analysis that excluded British Columbia and Hali-
fax (since most of the data from these 2 locations were imputed; 
Appendix 9, available at www.cmaj.ca/lookup/suppl/doi 
:10.1503/cmaj.161379/-/DC1). Thus, regardless of the cut points 
used for imputation of p16-positive status, there was a clinically 
significant rise in the incidence of p16-positive oropharyngeal 
cancer between 2000 and 2012. The rate of increase was greater 
for men than for women (Appendix 10, available at www.cmaj.
ca/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1503/cmaj.161379/-/DC1).
Interpretation
We found an increase in the incidence of p16-positive oropharyn-
geal cancers as a proportion of all oropharyngeal squamous cell 
cancers between 2000 and 2012 among patients managed at 
specialist surgical centres across Canada. The rate of increase 
was greater for men than for women. 
Selection bias occurs in HPV testing, and estimating changes in 
the incidence of p16-positive oropharyngeal cancer over time has 
therefore been difficult. Before implementation of routine HPV 
testing, clinicians were aware that additional testing created a bur-
den for clinical laboratories, and thus reserved testing for those 
most likely to have HPV positivity. Only as accumulating data have 
supported the clinical importance of HPV testing has routine test-
ing been implemented in most (though not all) Can 
adian centres. 
By imputing missing HPV status and finding different ways to vali-
date our findings (Appendix 3), we were able to estimate that the 
prevalence of HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancer in 5 Canadian 
centres rose from about 47% in 2000 to about 74% in 2012.
A recent systematic review reported that the rate of HPV-
positive oropharyngeal cancer in North America plateaued at 
65% from 2005 to 2014.5 However, a study in London, Ontario, 
was restricted to patients with tonsillar cancer for whom a 
pathology specimen was available;17 one study in Toronto 
included only 22 patients with oropharyngeal cancer;18 other 
Toronto-based studies either took place before routine HPV test-
ing12 or focused on recurrent or metastatic disease;19 and one 
study in Montréal analyzed patients with locally advanced cancer 
who were treated with primary chemoradiation and had a mini-
mum 3-year follow-up.20 A previous study of 1374 Ontario-based 
patients with oropharyngeal cancer suggested that 66% of cases 
were HPV-positive by 2010.1 Given the limitations of these previ-
ous studies, a more comprehensive study across multiple Cana-
dian centres was warranted.
HPV-positive oropharyngeal tumours differ from HPV-
negative tumours with respect to etiology, histology and out-
come, and we confirmed the need to test for HPV status as a rou-
tine diagnostic tool to differentiate these 2 distinct diseases.21 
Given the potential health policy implications of these time-
trend results, such as HPV vaccination for both sexes, we suggest 
that routine testing be accompanied by either routine supple-
mental coding (e.g., ICD or other system) or cancer registry anno-
tation, so that HPV-positive and HPV-negative cases can be easily 
and separately tracked in Canada. Efforts to standardize HPV 
testing methods also warrant consideration.
We used multiple imputation to estimate the probability of 
HPV-positive status, given the known associations of demo-
graphic, clinical and social habits with HPV status22 (Appendix 3). 
Although some applications of multiple imputation are contro-
versial,23 we used strongly predictive variables in this imputa-
tion.24 There is also evidence of the utility of imputation in data 
sets with large proportions of missing data.25,26 It is clear that

without imputation, testing bias would affect the accuracy of 
results.22,27 We calibrated our results using survival data, which 
were external to the multiple imputation process, and performed 
leave-one-out internal cross-validation. Sensitivity analyses of 
the chosen cut point suggest a substantial rise over time. We cau-
tion against overinterpreting the absolute values for the propor-
tion of cases that were HPV-positive in the earlier years; however, 
our findings regarding a rise in proportion of HPV-positive oro-
pharyngeal tumours are consistent with widespread clinical 
experience.

or Pr(p16+), was categorized into quintiles (Q5 = most likely to be p16-positive, Q1 = least likely 
to be p16-positive) and compared with patients with known p16 status. (B) The analysis was 
restricted to the validation subset (patients with known p16 status only; n = 1282). Overall sur-
vival is presented by Pr(p16+) dichotomized with 85% sensitivity, where Pr(p16+) = 68.7%, and 
compared with the actual (i.e., tested) p16 status.

Limitations
Data were not available from some parts of Canada; therefore, 
caution is urged in generalizing our findings to the entire Can-
adian population. One Quebec study estimated the prevalence of 
HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancer to be 43% (n = 21; 1997–
2001),28 which does not reflect potential effects of recent high 
rates of HPV vaccination in Quebec.29 Cancer centres in several 
provinces (Manitoba, Saskatchewan, New Brunswick, Prince 
Edward Island, and Newfoundland and Labrador) and the territo-
ries were not represented in this analysis, but the absolute num-
bers of oropharyngeal cancer cases at these centres are small 
and unlikely to influence our conclusions.30 A further limitation of 
this study was the lack of information on sexual history, a well-
recognized risk factor for chronic HPV infection.
Conclusion
HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancer rates have risen across multi-
ple Canadian centres. Although our findings are robust to sensi-
tivity analysis, the rate of increase cannot be firmly determined 
because different assumptions lead to different slopes of the rise 
in HPV rates over time. To aid in a better understanding of dis-
ease heterogeneity and burden, cancer centres could try to col-
lect risk factor data systematically (e.g., for smoking and alcohol 
consumption), and should strive to acquire tissue samples for
