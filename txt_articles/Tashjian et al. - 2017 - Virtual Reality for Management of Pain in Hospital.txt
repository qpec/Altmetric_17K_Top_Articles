Abstract
Background: Improvements in software and design and reduction in cost have made virtual reality (VR) a practical tool for
immersive, three-dimensional (3D), multisensory experiences that distract patients from painful stimuli.
Objective: The objective of the study was to measure the impact of a onetime 3D VR intervention versus a two-dimensional
(2D) distraction video for pain in hospitalized patients.
Methods: We conducted a comparative cohort study in a large, urban teaching hospital in medical inpatients with an average
pain score of ≥3/10 from any cause. Patients with nausea, vomiting, dementia, motion sickness, stroke, seizure, and epilepsy and
those placed in isolation were excluded. Patients in the intervention cohort viewed a 3D VR experience designed to reduce pain
using the Samsung Gear Oculus VR headset; control patients viewed a high-definition, 2D nature video on a 14-inch bedside
screen. Pre- and postintervention pain scores were recorded. Difference-in-difference scores and the proportion achieving a half
standard deviation pain response were compared between groups.
Results: There were 50 subjects per cohort (N=100). The mean pain reduction in the VR cohort was greater than in controls
(−1.3 vs −0.6 points, respectively; P=.008). A total of 35 (65%) patients in the VR cohort achieved a pain response versus 40%
of controls (P=.01; number needed to treat=4). No adverse events were reported from VR.
Conclusions: Use of VR in hospitalized patients significantly reduces pain versus a control distraction condition. These results
indicate that VR is an effective and safe adjunctive therapy for pain management in the acute inpatient setting; future randomized
trials should confirm benefit with different visualizations and exposure periods.

Introduction
Hospitalized patients frequently experience physical, emotional,
and social distress that is exacerbated by a radical change in
living environment, loss of customary rights and privileges, and
a high prevalence of pain [1]. Nearly half of hospitalized patients
experience pain, of which a quarter is considered “unbearable”
[2]. In order to care for the whole patient, hospital clinicians
must consider not only the physical impact of illness, but also
the psychosocial impact. However, the dynamic nature of

 hospital medicine, coupled with limited time to spend with
individual patients, poses challenges to offering holistic inpatient
care.
Treatment of pain in the acute care setting is often focused on
pharmacological management, which can yield inconsistent and
suboptimal pain control [3]. However, extensive data reveal
that adjunctive nonpharmacological techniques, such as
cognitive behavioral therapy and relaxation techniques, can
modify cognitions and behaviors that influence the perception
of pain [4].
Virtual reality (VR) technology provides an immersive,
multisensory, and three-dimensional (3D) environment that
enables users to have modified experiences of reality by creating
a sense of “presence” [5,6]. To date, VR has been used in
numerous clinical settings to help treat anxiety disorders, control
pain, support physical rehabilitation, and distract patients during
wound care [5-13]. For example, VR coupled with medication
is effective in decreasing pain during bandage changes for severe
burns [7,11,14,15]. Similarly, VR reduces pain and provides
positive distraction during routine procedures such as
intravenous line placements [10] and dental procedures [8,16].
Other studies reveal that VR helps manage chronic pain
conditions such as complex regional pain syndrome [17] and
chronic neck pain [18]. By stimulating the visual, auditory, and
proprioception senses, VR acts as a distraction to limit the user’s
processing of nociceptive stimuli [6].
However, the evidence to date supporting VR for inpatient care
has shortcomings. In a recent meta-analysis of randomized
controlled trials of VR for medical inpatients, we found 11
previous studies testing VR versus control conditions [19].
Although VR was effective and well tolerated in most studies,
the trials were generally small, of variable methodological
quality, limited to one indication at a time (eg, physical trauma,
stroke rehabilitation, brain injury, cancer pain), and not focused
on the acute care setting. It remains unclear if VR is superior
to conventional means of pain distraction, such as viewing
two-dimensional (2D) images, particularly in diverse populations
of hospitalized, acute care patients suffering from varying types
of pain. We have previously published data evaluating the
feasibility and initial qualitative experience of using VR in
hospitalized patients [20] but have not evaluated its impact on
patient perception versus a control condition in hospitalized
patients. In this study, we measured the impact of a 3D VR pain
distraction experience versus a 2D pain distraction video in a
diverse group of hospitalized patients with varying types of
somatic and visceral pain.
Methods
Participants
We conducted a nonrandomized, comparative cohort study over
a 6-month period to compare a 3D VR pain distraction
experience (administered during the first 3-month recruitment
period) with a 2D high-definition nature video on a 14-in screen
placed in easy viewing proximity (administered during the
second 3-month period), described further below. In both
cohorts, we recruited adults (18+ years) admitted to the Inpatient
Specialty Program at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, a large,
urban, tertiary care medical center. We excluded patients who
could not consent, who were placed in contact isolation, or who
had head wounds or bandages that interfere with the VR headset.
In addition, because VR may cause motion sickness in some
users [21], we excluded patients with a history of motion
sickness and vertigo and anyone experiencing active nausea or
vomiting. Patients with a history of seizures or epilepsy were
also excluded to limit the theoretical risk of inducing seizures
with VR (Samsung Gear user manual cites a 0.025% risk from
pediatric data). Patients with an average pain score of ≥3 out of
10 during the 24 hours preceding patient screening were selected
to participate in the study. We applied the same inclusion and
exclusion criteria for both cohorts and approached all eligible
patients in order of service admission.
Interventions
Virtual Reality Pain Distraction Experience
We administered VR using the Samsung (Ridgefield Park, NJ
07660) Gear Occulus headset fitted with a Samsung Galaxy S7
phone that delivers VR images and sound (Figure 1). We
selected the Samsung Gear because it is commercially available,
widely used, relatively inexpensive, has minimal visual latency,
and offers a generally positive patient experience based on our
previous research [20]. Higher-end tethered headsets, such as
the Oculus Rift, are currently more expensive and onerous to
use at scale in an inpatient setting. We used disposable sanitary
covers and foam backing on each headset between patient uses
and sanitized the equipment using the protocol we described in
previous research [20]. Patients watched a 15-minute VR
experience called Pain RelieVR, specifically designed to treat
pain in patients who are bedbound or have limited mobility
(AppliedVR, Los Angeles, CA, USA; Figure 2). Pain RelieVR
is an immersive, 360-degree, game experience that takes place
in a fantasy world where the user attempts to shoot balls at a
wide range of moving objects by maneuvering his or her head
toward the targets. This engaging, medium-intensity activity is
free of interruption, offering the user a distracting experience
designed to reduce the perception of pain. Pain RelieVR is a
nonviolent and noncompetitive game that incorporates
motivational music and features positively reinforcing sounds,
animation, and direct messages to patients. Forward-facing
action allows bedbound patients to engage without having to
turn backward or contort into potentially uncomfortable
positions. Figure 3 shows example patients using the Samsung
Gear headsets (used with written patient permission).

Two-Dimensional Pain Distraction Experience
During the control period, we administered a 2D high-definition
(1080p) video depicting relaxing nature scenes, including
mountain lakes and running streams from Patagonian vistas
presented with an audio track featuring Native American
Shaman music. We selected this video because of its
high-definition images, positively reinforcing music, and
emotionally calming content. Patients watched the video on a
14-in high-definition computer screen placed in easy viewing
proximity on a bedside or chairside table. We ran the video for
its first 15 minutes—the same duration as the VR intervention.
Study Procedures
Patients in both study periods were informed that researchers
were testing the effect of a distraction experience on the
perception of pain. Because it was important for the research
staff to exhibit equipoise when describing the potential benefits

 of the study intervention (ie, VR in cohort 1, nature video in
cohort 2), we prepared a script that used neutral language
regarding the study intervention. Once consented, patients rated
their current pain using a standard 11-point numeric rating scale
(NRS), ranging from 0 (no pain) to 10 (“the worst pain of your
life”). The NRS is a validated measure of pain widely employed
in clinical practice based on its ease of use, high compliance
rates, and responsiveness to detect meaningful changes in pain
[22]. Although predominantly tested for somatic pain, we have
previously demonstrated psychometric validity of the NRS for
visceral pain [23]. Patients in both groups repeated the NRS
assessment 2 minutes after completion of the intervention. In
addition, because VR has potential for adverse events, we
evaluated for dizziness, vertigo, nausea, vomiting, and seizures.
We also measured changes in blood pressure and heart rate in
the VR group.
Statistical Analysis and Sample Size
We calculated descriptive statistics for key demographic and
clinical characteristics between groups, including age, sex, race
and ethnicity, primary reason for hospitalization, and baseline
pain scores. We performed bivariate analysis to evaluate for
significant differences between groups, including two-sample
t tests for continuous parametric variables and chi-square tests
for categorical variables.
We next compared pre- and postintervention pain scores within
subjects (using paired t
tests) and then compared
difference-in-difference (DID) pain scores between cohorts
(using the rank sum test given nonparametric DID distributions).
In addition, we classified each individual patient as a responder
or nonresponder using the criterion standard of achieving an
effect size of ≥0.5 standard deviation on the pain scale, a
“medium” effect size using the rule of Cohen, and a value
corresponding to the minimum clinically important difference
(MCID) using the rule of Norman [24]. We compared the
proportion responding between groups using chi-square test and
calculated the number needed to treat (NNT) between groups.
Because the study used a mixed factorial design, we used a
repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA), which
incorporated both a between-subjects and within-subject factor
(pretest-posttest). The F ratio of interest in the analysis was the
interaction between the 2 factors, representing the treatment
main effect. After estimation, we calculated eta squared (η2),
which can be interpreted as how much of the variation in the
sample can be explained by the interaction.
Finally, to adjust for potential differences in patient
characteristics between groups, we performed multivariable
linear regression analysis to test the independent effect of VR
on pain reduction, adjusting for demographic and clinical
variables. To support a regression model with 5 covariates, and
assuming at least 20 subjects per covariate, we required a total
sample size of 100 patients. All analyses were conducted using
Stata 14 (StataCorp).

Results
Patient Characteristics
There were 50 patients in each group (N=100). Table 1 provides
baseline demographic and clinical characteristics. There were
no significant differences between groups for age, sex, race, or
ethnicity. The reasons for admission between groups were
similar except for the proportion admitted for pulmonary reasons
(higher in control group) and orthopedic reasons (higher in VR
group). The mean baseline pain score was the same (5.4 points)
in both groups.

was used).
Difference in Pain Scores
When focusing on within-subject changes in pain, there was a
significant drop in pain in both the patients in the VR group
(pre-VR mean 5.4, SD 2.6; post-VR mean 4.1, SD 2.7;
delta=1.3; P<.001; percent reduction=24%) and the control
patients (preintervention mean 5.4, SD 2.6; postintervention
mean 4.8, SD 2.7; delta=0.6; P<.001; percent reduction=13.2%),
with a larger drop in the VR group than controls (Table 2).
When comparing between groups, the DID of −0.7 points was
highly significant in favor of VR (P=.008). Using a binary
responder definition of a ≥0.5 standard deviation drop in pain,
there was a higher proportion of responders in the VR group
(65%) versus the control group (40%; P=.01, absolute
difference=25%, NNT=4). In the repeated-measures ANOVA,
results showed that VR elicited a statistically significant
difference in pain scores following treatment, F1,97=7.45,
P<.001. The calculated η2 was .07, which Cohen considers
equivalent to an effect size slightly greater than medium. In
multivariable regression analysis adjusting for age, race,
ethnicity, sex, and reason for hospitalization, VR remained a
significant predictor of pain reduction (beta coefficient=−0.65
point, 95% CI −1.3 to 0, P=.05). There were no differences in
the effect of VR by age, race, ethnicity, sex, or reason for
hospitalization.

Discussion
Although VR has been studied in a variety of conditions
including wound care, rehabilitation, and anxiety, its
effectiveness for managing pain in hospitalized patients has not
been fully examined. In this study, we found that use of a
15-minute VR intervention in a diverse group of hospitalized
patients resulted in statistically significant and clinically relevant
(NNT=4) improvements in pain versus a control distraction
video without triggering adverse events or altering vital signs.
These results indicate that VR may be an effective adjunctive
therapy to complement traditional pain management protocols
in hospitalized patients.
Whereas previous VR research has traditionally focused on
specific types of pain [6-10,12,25,26], our study is unique for
evaluating VR across a wide range of somatic and visceral pain
conditions. In multivariable regression analysis, we found the
effect of VR was independent of the reason for hospitalization
or primary cause of pain, suggesting that VR has benefits across
wide groups of inpatients. Because this study is focused on a
single pain distraction visualization, future research should
evaluate whether and how to tailor VR content for specific pain
syndromes, as this may have incremental benefits over a single,
generic VR intervention. Similarly, future research should
investigate active VR interventions, such as mindful meditation
visualizations, in addition to passive distraction experiences.
Nonetheless, the finding that a single intervention improved
pain across diverse conditions suggests a common mechanism
for the pain benefits of VR.
It remains unknown exactly how VR works to reduce pain
perception across conditions. Most proposed mechanisms
attribute the benefit to simple distraction [6]. When the mind is
deeply engaged in an immersive experience, it becomes difficult,
if not impossible, to perceive stimuli outside of the field of
attention [27]. By “hijacking” the auditory, visual, and
proprioception senses, VR is thought to create an immersive
distraction that restricts the mind from processing pain [6].
Additional research should evaluate the neurobiological
mechanisms of VR across pain conditions and measure whether
its benefits in hospitalized patients, in particular, extend beyond
the immediate VR treatment period.
Our study has several important limitations. First, although we
compared results between 2 well-characterized groups in this
early phase VR study, this was not a randomized controlled
trial. Nonetheless, we performed multivariable regression
analysis to adjust for variations between groups and still found
that exposure to VR was a significant predictor of reduced pain.
Future research should randomize patients in a larger,
prospective comparison trial. Second, the VR intervention was
only 15 minutes long and included only one visualization; it is
possible that pain may rebound after VR and/or longer-term
benefits require more sustained and repeated exposure to varying
content. Future research should evaluate the effect of altering
the duration, intensity, frequency, and content of VR compared
with control conditions. Third, because this was a onetime
intervention we did not measure the impact of VR on use of
pain medications, hospital length of stay, or postdischarge
satisfaction scores. Nonetheless, this study is, to our knowledge,
the first to measure the impact of VR on pain management

 versus a control condition among a diverse group of hospitalized
patients. Fourth, it is impossible to know whether the greater
effectiveness of the VR condition was due to presenting a 3D
virtual environment (vs a 2D environment) or playing a highly
involving, active game versus a passive distraction experience.
It is not possible from this experimental design to determine
definitively if the observed effect in pain reduction was due to
the 3D versus 2D experience, active versus passive components,
variations in visual and audio between conditions, or other
attributes that measurably vary between arms. Our pragmatic
trial is a first step along a path of additional investigations;
future research should test other control conditions and
visualization to understand whether there are unique benefits
of the 3D VR experience over other control conditions. Finally,
our protocol did not track the characteristics and reasons for
patient ineligibility or refusal to use VR. However, our previous
research found that many hospitalized patients are not eligible
to use VR for various reasons, including active neurological
symptoms, ongoing nausea or vomiting, injury to the face or
neck, epilepsy, too frail or debilitated, or receiving mechanical
ventilation. Moreover, we found that among those who are
medically eligible to use VR, up to two-thirds are unwilling to
try the technology, particularly older individuals. Taken together,
these findings reveal barriers to widespread use of VR in
hospitalized patients. Future research should study whether
adoption rates are increasing and whether using VR is
cost-effective for hospitals given variable patient uptake.
These results indicate that VR is an effective, safe, and feasible
intervention to aid with pain management among diverse
hospitalized patients. Larger randomized clinical trials are
needed to better characterize its impact on longer-term pain
perception, resource utilization, and postdischarge outcomes.
