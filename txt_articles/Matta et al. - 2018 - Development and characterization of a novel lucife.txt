A simple, accurate, sensitive and robust assay that can rapidly and specifically measure the death of 
target cells would have applications in many areas of biomedicine and particularly for the development 
of novel cellular- and immune-therapeutics. In this study, we describe a novel cytotoxicity assay, 
termed the Matador assay, which takes advantage of the extreme brightness, stability and glow-like 
characteristics of recently discovered novel marine luciferases and their engineered derivatives. The 
assay involves expression of a luciferase of interest in target cells in a manner so that it is preferentially 
retained within the healthy cells but is either released from dead and dying cells or whose activity can 
be preferentially measured in dead and dying cells. We demonstrate that this assay is highly sensitive, 
specific, rapid, and can be performed in a single-step manner without the need for any expensive 
equipment. We further validate this assay by demonstrating its ability to detect cytotoxicity induced 
by several cellular and immune-therapeutic agents including antibodies, natural killer cells, chimeric 
antigen receptor expressing T cells and a bispecific T cell engager.
A number of agents that selectively induce cytotoxicity and eliminate diseased cells are currently under develop-
ment. These agents range from small molecules or biologics to cytolytic immune effector cells genetically engi-
neered to selectively recognize tumor associated antigens (TAA). Successful selection and optimization of these 
agents depends on the accuracy and sensitivity of assays employed to measure cytotoxicity.
Several assays have been developed to measure cytotoxicity. Of these, radio-active chromium (Cr51) release 
assay developed in 1968 is most commonly used worldwide1. In this assay, target cells labeled with Cr51 are incu-
bated with effector cells and Cr51 released upon their lysis serves as a measure of the effector cell cytotoxicity. 
However, several limitations including the hazards associated with harmful effects of radioactivity, additional 
costs of disposal of radioactive waste and requirement of additional equipment like gamma counters, have 
prompted researchers to seek safer alternative approaches. For example, cell membranes of target cells can be 
labeled with fluorescent dyes and cytotoxic response can be evaluated using multicolor flow cytometric analysis2. 
However, the successful application of this approach demands careful calibration and labor intensive data analysis 
to efficiently distinguish the target and effector cell populations.
Living cells exclude vital dyes such as trypan blue. Loss of cell membrane integrity not only allows the vital 
dyes to enter the cell but also results in release of cytoplasmic components into the surrounding medium. Some 
cytotoxicity assays are based on quantification of the release of cytosolic enzymes such as lactose dehydrogenase 
(LDH)3, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (G3PDH)4 or adenylate kinase (AK)5 from dead cells. All 
these assays measure enzyme activity either directly by providing substrates that would be converted to fluores-
cent or luminescent products or include a second step wherein products of the primary reaction indirectly gener-
ate substrate for a luciferase reaction. Most of these enzymatic methods require a two-step procedure to remove 
culture medium to a separate container and thus are non-homogeneous. Additionally, these methods, in general, 
have poor sensitivity and, importantly, are unable to distinguish between death of target and effector cells, since 
both types of cells release cellular enzymes upon lysis.

Luciferases have been used extensively as reporters because of their ability to provide highly sensitive quan-
titation with broad linearity6. Firefly (Fluc) and Renilla (Rluc) luciferases have accounted for the majority of 
such applications7. A luciferase release-based cytotoxicity assay was first described by Schafer et al. using Fluc8. 
However, the shorter half-life of Fluc (<30 minutes) in tissue culture medium hindered its wider use8,9. Fu et al.10  
also tried to develop a T cell cytotoxicity assay based on measurement of Fluc that has been released in the 
medium of Fluc-expressing target cells upon incubation with cytotoxic T cells. Surprisingly, incubation 
of cytotoxic T cells with the tumor cell targets did not result in significant release of luciferase in the culture 
medium10. Therefore, the idea of measuring release of luciferase in the supernatant as an assay for cytotoxicity 
was abandoned8,10.
A number of novel luciferases have been discovered from deep sea marine organisms. These marine lucif-
erases are smaller in size, ATP-independent and have much brighter luminescence and stability as compared to 
Fluc11. All of them have an N-terminal 17–22 amino acid consensus sequence that signals secretion11.
In this study, we describe the development of a novel cytotoxicity assay, termed Matador assay, which is based 
on increase of reporter activity of cytosolic sequestered variants of reporters, such as marine luciferases, from 
dead and dying cells. The Matador assay is based on the fact that loss of cell membrane integrity results not only 
in the release of cytosolic sequestered reporters into the surrounding medium but also in the greater and faster 
penetration of the reporter substrate into the cell where it can react with any reporter still trapped inside the cell. 
The Matador assay takes advantage of the longer half-life (>24 hours), stability and extreme brightness of the 
marine luciferases and their engineered derivatives. The assay is non-radioactive, extremely sensitive, inexpen-
sive, homogeneous and amenable to miniaturization and automation.
Results
Development of a cytotoxicity assay based on transient expression of different luciferases in cytosol. 
 
Gaussia luciferase (Gluc; 185 aa, 19.9 kDa) is one of the smallest luciferase known and is naturally secreted12. We 
hypothesized that deletion of signal sequence of Gluc will result in the entrapment of the protein inside the cells. 
Treatment of cells with intracellular expression of Gluc with cytotoxic cells or agents will compromise cell mem-
brane integrity, resulting in the release of entrapped Gluc, which would serve as a readout for cell death. To test 
our hypothesis, we cloned the cDNA of Gluc lacking its signal peptide (SP) into a retroviral vector (MSCV-hygro-
Gluc). We also expressed the Gluc cDNA lacking the signal peptide from lentiviral vectors pLenti (expression 
driven by CMV promoter) and pLenti-EF1α
 (expression driven by the constitutively active Elongation Factor 
1-alpha promoter). The construct pLenti-Pac-Gluc, also expressed the puromycin resistance gene (Pac) upstream 
of and in-frame with the Gluc cDNA and separated from the latter by a T2A ribosomal skip sequence.
We transiently transfected the above vectors into 293FT cells. Approximately 24 hours post-transfection, 
cells were treated with 30 µg/ml of digitonin for 90 minutes to induce cell death. Treatment of 293FT cells trans-
fected with SP-deleted Gluc with digitonin resulted in a dramatic increase of Gluc activity in the supernatant 
(Fig. 1A). In particular, digitonin-treatment of cells transfected with MSCV-Hygro-Gluc, pLenti-Gluc, and 
pLenti-Pac-Gluc resulted in 20-, 4974-, and 3828-fold increase in Gluc activity, respectively, as compared to the 
untreated cells. To examine whether this phenomenon is extendable to other luciferases, we cloned SP-deleted 
versions of Nluc, Tluc16, Mluc7, Paluc1, Loluc and Htluc1 into lenti- and/or retro-viral vectors. The constructs 
were transfected into 293FT cells and treated with digitonin to induce cell death. Consistent with the previous 
results, treatment with digitonin resulted in 127-, 60-, 13-, 44-, 355-, 789-, 11-, and 30-fold increase in lucif-
erase activity in the supernatant of cells transfected with MSCV-Hygro-Nluc, pLenti-Nluc, MSCV-Hygro-Mluc7, 
pLenti-Mluc7, pLenti-Tluc16, MSCV-Hygro-Paluc1, MSCV-Hygro-Htluc1 and pLenti-Loluc, respectively 
(Fig. 1A). Interestingly, treatment with digitonin also resulted in a significant increase in luciferase activity in 
the supernatant of cells transfected with expression vectors encoding commonly used renilla (Rluc) and firefly 
(Fluc) luciferases with fold increases of 16, 5.5, 26, and 230 for MSCV-Hygro-Rluc, pLenti-Rluc, pRetroQ-Fluc, 
and pLenti-Fluc, respectively (Fig. 1A, bottom panel). Cell death induction by digitonin was further confirmed 
by increased staining with sytox green, a cell impermeable dye that stains cells that have lost membrane integrity 
(Fig. 1B). Collectively, the above results suggest that potentially all luciferases can serve as candidates for the 
development of Matador cytotoxicity assay.
Performance of cytotoxicity assay on cancer cell lines stably expressing various luciferases. 
 
We next tested the feasibility of our assay in cancer cell lines stably expressing various luciferases. For this 
purpose, we infected K562, Nalm6, HEL92.1.7 and Raji cells with pLenti-Pac-Gluc virus and selected stably 
transduced cells with puromycin. Treatment of Gluc-expressing K562, Nalm6, HEL92.1.7 and Raji cells with 
digitonin resulted in 23-, 29-, 36- and 25-fold increase of Gluc activity, respectively, as compared to the untreated 
cells (Fig. 2A). Essentially similar results were obtained with K562 cells stably transduced with pLenti-Nluc, 
plenti-Tluc16, MSCV-Hygro-Mluc7, and MSCV-Hygro-Rluc (Fig. 2B). The death of K562 cells after treatment 
with digitonin was confirmed by sytox-green staining (Fig. 2C). These results demonstrate that the Matador assay 
can be performed on cell lines stably expressing the different luciferases.
Sensitivity of the Matador assay. 
To determine the sensitivity of the Matador assay, we plated different 
cell concentrations of K562, Nalm6 and Raji cells stably expressing Gluc followed by treatment with digitonin to 
induce cell death. Strikingly, in all the tested cell lines, there was a significant increase in the luciferase activity 
upon induction of cell death (Fig. 3A). Importantly, the increase in luciferase activity was evident even in wells 
that contained a single cell (Fig. 3A). Moreover, there was a near linear increase in the luciferase values with 
increase in cell numbers (R2 ≥
 0.97) (Fig. 3B). Essentially, similar results were obtained with Raji, K562, and

HEL92.1.7 cells stably expressing Nluc, or Mluc7 (Supplementary Fig. S1), highlighting the extreme sensitivity 
and broad applicability of the assay.
We also compared the sensitivity of the Matador assay with LDH and Calcein-release assays, two cytotoxicity 
assays that are in common use. In contrast to single cell sensitivity of the Matador assay, the minimum num-
ber of cells that could be detected with the LDH and the Calcein-release assays were 256 and 64, respectively 
(Supplementary Figs S2 and S3). Thus, the Matador assay possesses greater sensitivity as compared to the LDH- 
and Calcein-release assays.

in either retroviral or lentiviral vectors were transiently transfected in 293FT cells. Approximately, 18 hours 
post-transfection cells were treated with digitonin (30 µg/ml) for 90 minutes or left untreated (control). Cell-
free supernatants (25 µl) were assayed for luminescence by addition of coelenterazine containing assay buffer 
(25 µl) directly to each well in a 384-well lumitrac plate for Gluc, Nluc, Mluc7, Tluc16, Paluc1, Htluc1, Loluc 
and Rluc. For Fluc, D-Luciferin containing assay buffer was used. The fold change in the relative luminescence

The Matador assay is a single step homogenous assay. 
A single-step homogenous assay, which does 
not involve a centrifugation step to separate the cells from supernatant, has obvious advantages for miniaturiza-
tion and automation. Most of the experiments described in the preceding sections (Figs 2 and 3) were done in a 
homogeneous manner. To assess whether separation of supernatants from cell pellets alters the sensitivity of the 
assay, we performed the assay in cell-free supernatant, cells alone and in total homogeneous mixture. For this 
purpose, K562 cells stably expressing Gluc were co-cultured with the natural killer-derived cell line NK92MI at 
an Effector:Target (E:T) ratio of 0.5:1 for 4 hours, followed by the measurement of Gluc activity in the different 
fractions. Figure 4(A,B) shows that induction of K562-Gluc cell death by NK92MI cells resulted in significant and 
near equivalent increases in Gluc activity when measured directly by adding coelenterazine (CTZ) assay buffer 
to the wells containing the cells or to the wells containing cell-free supernatant. These results demonstrate that 
the centrifugation step to collect the cleared supernatant can be omitted without compromising the sensitivity 
of the assay, thereby yielding a single-step homogenous assay. We also observed a slight increase in Gluc activity 
when the assay was performed on the cell pellet of K562-Gluc cells that had been co-cultured with NK92MI cells 
(Fig. 4C). This could reflect greater penetration of CTZ in cells with impaired cell membrane integrity.

Marine luciferase and their engineered derivatives are highly stable in cell culture supernatants 
and are ideal for the Matador assay. 
Although the development of a cytotoxicity assay based on the 
release of Fluc in the cellular supernatant has been tried in the past, the short half-life of Fluc in the tissue culture 
medium precluded its successful development8. The marine luciferases used in this study have been reported to 
have longer half-life (>24 hours) in tissue culture medium (Table 1). However, we wanted to confirm that they 
would retain their stability under the assay conditions and will not get degraded by the proteases released dur-
ing the process of cell death. Therefore, to demonstrate that the marine luciferases are suitable for the Matador 
assay, K562 cells stably expressing Gluc, Nluc, Tluc16, Mluc7 and Fluc, were plated in a 24-well plate and treated 
with media alone or with NK92MI cells at an Effector:Target (E:T) ratio of 1:1 for 6 hours. Post-incubation, 
the cell-free supernatants were divided into 7 different tubes and frozen immediately at −
80 °C. The tubes were 
then incubated at 37 °C for 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, and 24 hours. After incubation, supernatants were transferred to a 
384-well plate, and luminescence was measured by adding CTZ-containing assay buffer (for Gluc, Nluc, Tluc16, 
Figure 3. Sensitivity of the Matador assay. (A) Indicated cell lines stably expressing pLenti-Pac-Gluc were 
placed in a 384-well plate at indicated numbers (by serial dilution), and treated with digitonin (30 µg/ml) for 
120 minutes or vehicle (control). Luminescence was detected by the addition of coelentrazine containing assay 
buffer directly to each well. Statistically significant differences are shown by asterisks (**) at a level of P < 0.01 
and (***) at a level of P < 0.001. Statistical differences shown are between control vs digitonin treated samples.

values with the maximum cell numbers plated (4096) or the luminescence values from the well with maximum 
number of cells, respectively. R2 = Correlation coefficient. The values shown are mean ± SE of a representative 
experiment performed in triplicate for at least two times.

and Mluc7), and D-luciferin-containing assay buffer (for Fluc). As shown in Fig. 5, luminescence of Gluc, Nluc, 
Tluc16, and Mluc7 was stable for 24 hours at 37 °C in cell culture supernatants, demonstrating the suitability of 
these luciferases for the Matador assay. In contrast, luminescence of Fluc started decaying as early as 0.5 hours, 
confirming that Fluc may not be a suitable candidate for the Matador assay.
Ectopic expression of marine luciferases does not alter the sensitivity of the transduced cells 
to cytotoxic agents. 
It is conceivable that expression of marine luciferases may alter the sensitivity of target 
cells to cell death inducing agents. In order to rule out this possibility, K562 cells stably expressing Gluc, Nluc, 
Tluc16, Mluc7, and parental line were treated with digitonin and Triton X-100. The cell death was measured by 
LDH and Calcein-release assays. As shown in Fig. 6A,B, the parental and the marine luciferases-transduced K562 
cells have similar sensitivity to cytotoxicity induced by digitonin and Triton X-100, as measured by two assays that 
are independent of the measurement of luciferase activity. These results demonstrate that marine luciferase gene 
transduction did not alter the sensitivity of cells to cytotoxic agents. Further, we have made more than 80 cell lines 
stably transduced with marine luciferases and have not observed any significant changes in their morphology, 
growth rate, sensitivity to chimeric antigen receptors expressing T cells or other characteristics in comparison to 
their parental cell lines.
Exemplary applications of the Matador assay in the areas of cellular- and immuno-therapy. 
 
Cytotoxic assays are frequently used in the fields of cellular- and immune-therapy, such as to test the cytotoxicity 
of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-expressing T cells, Bispecific T cell Engagers (BiTE) and cytotoxic antibodies. 
Figure 4. The Matador assay is a single step homogenous assay. K562 cells stably expressing Gluc were 
co-cultured with NK92MI in a 24-well plate at an Effector:Target (E:T) ratio of 0.5:1 for 4 hours. Post-
incubation, the cells were mixed well, collected in a 1.5 ml microfuge tubes and divided into 3 parts. (A) (Total/
homogeneous), the cells along with supernatant were directly assayed for luciferase activity by plating in a 384-
well plate. (B) (Cell free supernatant), cells were centrifuged and cell supernatants alone were collected in a new 
tube and plated in a 384-well plate, followed by measurement of the luciferase activity. (C) (Cells Pellet), cells 
were centrifuged, supernatant was removed, cell pellets were resuspended in PBS and plated in a 384-well plate 
to measure luciferase activity. Total reaction volume plated in 384-well plate for all 3 parts was kept constant 
at 50 µl per well and 15 µl of coelenterazine assay buffer was added in well mode to measure luciferase activity. 
The three figures are from a single experiment and therefore the values can be compared across the three 
figures for comparison. The values shown are mean ± SE of a representative experiment performed in triplicate. 
Statistically significant difference is shown by asterisks (****) at a level of P < 0.0001. Statistical differences 
shown are between K562 + Media vs K562 + NK92MI.

However, a problem with most currently used cytotoxic assays, such as the LDH release assay, is their inability 
to distinguish between the death of the target cells from death of the effector cells. To demonstrate the utility of 
the Matador assay in co-culture experiments, we generated NK92MI cells stably expressing a chimeric antigen 
receptor (CAR), designated FMC63-CAR, targeting CD19. We also generated a CAR targeting a protein encoded 
by the Kaposi’s sarcoma herpesvirus (KSHV), designated 4C3-CAR, to serve as a control. The expression vectors 
encoding the CARs also co-expressed Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP), which was used to confirm expression 
of the CAR construct in NK92MI cells using flow cytometry analysis (Fig. 7A). As shown in Fig. 7B, co-culture of 
CD19+ve Raji cells stably expressing Nluc (Raji-pLenti-Nluc) with FMC63-CAR-expressing NK92MI cells resulted 
in a robust increase in the Nluc activity, whereas co-culture with the control 4C3-CAR-expressing NK92MI 
cells failed to do so (Fig. 7B). Essentially similar results were obtained upon co-culture of Raji-pLenti-Nluc 
cells with primary T cells that had been transduced with the different CAR constructs (Fig. 7C). We also calcu-
lated the percentage-specific lysis induced by different CAR constructs (Fig. 7D) by taking the Nluc activity of 
digitonin-treated cells as a measure of maximum cell death and Nluc activity of untreated cells as a measure of 
spontaneous cell death. The percent specific lysis of Raji-pLenti-Nluc cells induced by FMC63-CAR-T cells was 
approximately 20%.
We next tested the ability of the Matador assay to detect Blinatumomab- and Rituximab- induced cytotox-
icity. Blinatumomab is a bispecific T cell engager (BiTE) which has binding sites for both CD19 (present on 
B-lineage lymphoid cells) and CD3 (present on T-cells), and results in the activation of T-cells and destruction of 
CD19+ cells13. Co-culture of Raji-Gluc cells with T-cells in the presence of Blinatumomab resulted in a striking 
increase in Gluc activity as compared with Raji-Gluc cells treated with Blinatumomab alone or untreated T-cells 
(Fig. 7E). Rituximab is a CD20 monoclonal antibody that is in clinical use for a number of B cell malignancies14. 
Rituximab induces antibody-dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity of CD20+ cells. As shown in Fig. 7F, co-culture 
of Raji-Gluc cells with peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in the presence of Rituximab resulted in a 
robust increase in Gluc activity as compared to cells in which either PBMCs or Rituximab was excluded. Taken 
collectively, the above results demonstrate the utility of the Matador assay to detect cytotoxicity induced by a 
number of cellular and biological therapeutics.
Primary cells and cell lines transiently expressing luciferase reporters can be used in the Matador 
assay. 
In the preceding examples, we demonstrated the feasibility of performing the Matador assay on cell 
lines that were stably transduced with the various marine luciferases. Since the generation of stably transduced 
cell lines takes several weeks, we tested the feasibility of performing the Matador assay on cell lines that had been 
transduced with marine luciferase expressing viral vectors but had not undergone the time-consuming step of 
drug selection to select stably transduced clones. K562, Nalm6, BC-1, and KG-1 cells were transiently transduced 
with the pLenti-Pac-Gluc viral vector and 48 hours post-transduction treated with digitonin to induce cell death. 
Figure 5. Stability of different luciferases used in the Matador assay. K562 cells stably expressing Gluc/Fluc, 
Nluc, Tluc16, and Mluc7 were plated in a 24-well plate, treated with media alone (control) or co-cultured 
with NK92MI at Effector:Target (E:T) ratio of 1:1 for 6 hours. After incubation, cell free supernatants were 
transferred into 7 different tubes and frozen immediately at −
80 °C. The tubes were directly transferred to 37 °C 
(from −
80 °C) and were incubated for indicated time periods (0–24 hours). The luminescence was measured by 
adding coelenterazine-containing assay buffer (for Gluc, Nluc, Tluc16, and Mluc7) and D-luciferin containing 
assay buffer (for Fluc) directly to each well. The values shown are mean ± SE of a representative experiment 
performed in duplicate for at least three times.

Digitonin-treatment resulted in striking increases in the luminescence signal of all the cell lines that were transduced 
with pLenti-Pac-Gluc (Fig. 8A). Essentially similar results were obtained when Raji and K562 cells were transiently 
transfected with a Gluc encoding plasmid and cell death was induced by treatment with digitonin, FMC63-CAR-T 
or NK92MI cells (Supplementary Fig. S4).
Finally, we tested the feasibility of Matador assay on primary cells. Primary leukemia cells isolated from 
patients with Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML), B-cell lymphocytic leukemia (B-ALL), chronic myeloid leukemia 
and T cell prolymphocytic leukemia (T-PLL) were transduced with pLenti-Pac-Gluc lentivirus supernatant. 
Approximately 48 hours post-transduction, cell death was induced by treatment with digitonin. A significant 
increase in the luminescence signal was observed in all the Gluc-expressing primary samples upon the induction 
of cell death (Fig. 8B).
Discussion
Recent success in clinical trials using chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) targeting CD19 for B cell malignancies and 
the FDA approval of Blinatumomab have revived hopes for immunotherapeutic approaches to treat cancer15–17. 
Numerous academic laboratories and pharmaceutical companies are now developing CARs and BiTEs with pre-
defined specificity to desired tumor associated antigens (TAA) for adoptive cellular therapy. The success of these 
efforts and prior conventional approaches using tumor specific T-cell receptors largely relies on availability of 
a simple, accurate and robust assay to rapidly assess the ability of the immune effector cells to kill tumor cells 
expressing desired TAA.
The Cr51 assay has been used as the “gold standard” for evaluating cell mediated cytotoxicity for nearly five 
decades1. This assay demands prior loading of target cells with radioactive Cr51, which is released into the culture 
medium upon cell lysis mediated by the effector cells. In addition to health risks associated with radioactivity,

bound Cr51 from lysed cells is inefficient, leading to low signal-to-noise ratio18. To circumvent these issues asso-
ciated with exogenous chemical agents, other assays that monitor release of endogenous enzymes, such as LDH 
and G3PDH, were developed3–5. However, as these enzymes are endogenously expressed in both effector and 
target cells, measurement of their release as a measure of cellular toxicity can be inaccurate in a heterogeneous 
mixture. In particular, activation induced cell death of effector cells, which are present in excess in cytotoxicity 
assays, can confound the interpretation of results. Though alternative approaches using fluorescent dyes have 
been developed2, difficulties associated with efficient preloading and spontaneous release from target cells still 
pose technical challenges.
To overcome the above limitations, an attempt was made to develop a luciferase-release based cytotoxicity 
assay using Fluc8. However, it was observed that the half- life of Fluc under culture conditions is only about 
30 minutes so that after 4 hours almost 80% of the original enzyme is inactive and no longer detectable8. This 
precluded the use of Fluc as a reporter for cytotoxicity assays requiring more than 2 hours of incubation. 
Furthermore, it was observed that it is not informative to calculate the released Fluc enzyme activity relative 
to the 100% lysis value because depending on the kinetics of the release, variable proportions of the released 
enzyme will be inactive at the time of removal of the supernatant for measurement8. An additional limitation of 
Fluc-release based cytotoxicity assay was discovered in a study by Fu et al.10. These investigators were not able 
to detect luciferase activity in the cell culture supernatant of 4T1-Her2 cells that stably-expressed Fluc upon T 
cell mediated cytolysis. Due to the above limitations of short half-life and inconsistency of detection, Fluc-based 
reporter release assay is not routinely used for measuring cell-mediated cytotoxicity.
The Matador assay described in this study uses marine luciferases and has several distinct advantages over 
Fluc-based reporter release assays described previously. First, the assay takes advantage of the extreme bright-
ness and ultra-sensitivity of the marine luciferases, which is, in general, several orders of magnitude higher than 
Fluc7,12, making it an extremely sensitive assay, In fact, the Matador assay is capable of detecting cell death at a 
single cell level. Second, in contrast to the short half-life of Fluc, marine luciferases used in this study are highly 
stable in cell culture media (t1/2 > 24 hours). Therefore, the Matador assay is ideal for most cytotoxicity assays 
which are generally carried over durations of 4 hours or more. Third, the marine luciferases and their engineered 
variants are highly thermostable, as indicated by their ability to retain bulk of their activity even after incubation 
at higher temperatures (≥
48 °C)7,11,19,20, thereby allowing handling and storage of samples at room temperature 
or higher post-experiment or during transportation. In contrast, Fluc loses most of its activity after incubation at

30 °C7. Moreover, marine luciferases also retain their activity upon freezing and thawing. We have observed that 
the supernatants can be frozen and thawed at a later time for running the assay without compromising quality 
(unpublished observation). Finally, in contrast to inconsistent results obtained with Fluc-based reporter release 
assays in the published literature10, we have made more than 80 cell lines stably expressing Gluc and other lucif-
erases described in this study in the cytosol, and have not come across any cell line in which the Matador assay 
did not work as expected.
The Matador assay has several additional advantages. Unlike Cr51 or florescent dye release assays, there is 
no need to preload the target cell on the day of the experiment or perform laborious procedures of washing to 
remove excess label. Further, the assay eliminates the need for laborious multistep assay formats involving separa-
tion of cells from supernatant, which may lead to both operational errors and inaccuracies in calculation of cyto-
toxicity. Once the target and effector cells are co-cultured, the whole assay is performed by a single step addition 
of assay reagent, thus allowing the possibility of assessing cell mediated cytotoxicity in high-throughput fashion. 
Although, we have not yet tested it, we speculate that in addition to measurement of cytotoxicity at multiple time 
points, the assay can be multiplexed with other assays, such as measurement of cytokine release from target cells. 
Target cells expressing marine luciferases can be prepared in advance and can be readily used when needed. 
Additionally, we have also demonstrated that the Matador assay is equally sensitive when luciferases are expressed 
by transient transfection. To expand the utility of the Matador assay for some hard-to-transfect cells, we have 
cloned all the luciferases in retro-and/or lentiviral vectors. This allows generation of different target cells stably 
expressing the luciferase of choice, which can be frozen for long term usage and enable sharing of these cells with 
other investigators. In addition, we have shown that the assay can be performed on primary cells in which the 
luciferase is expressed transiently. However, when working with primary cultures containing a mixture of cells, 
there is a possibility that different sub-populations of cells may have different susceptibility to transduction with 
viral vectors or express different levels of the reporter. If measurement of cell death of a specific sub-population in 
a polyclonal sample is desired, it is highly recommended to isolate the specific sub-population, for example using 
flow cytometry, before the performance of the assay.
Apart from a striking increase in luminescence in the cellular supernatants upon cell death, we also observed 
a slight increase in luminescence in the cell pellets of target cells (Fig. 4). This could be due to the fact that loss 
of cell membrane integrity results in increased penetration of CTZ into the dead and dying cells, where it reacts 
with any Gluc that has been trapped inside the cells and has not yet leaked out. Thus, the Matador assay is not 
only based on the release of Gluc (and other reporters) into the media due to loss of membrane integrity but also 
on the increased penetration of the substrate (or other essential components) required for the reporter activity 
into cells that have lost membrane integrity. This suggests that the assay may be further modified by targeting the 
reporters to different cellular compartments, such as to the cell membrane by adding a myristoylation signal21. 
Similarly, amino acid sequences that target the reporter proteins to other cellular compartments (e.g., nucleus, 
mitochondria, and golgi) have been described in the literature22–24 and can be used to develop assays that measure 
the integrity of different cellular compartments and components (e.g. mitochondrial membrane integrity).
The Matador assay has many potential applications in biomedical research and manufacturing of cellular 
therapy products. The assay may be used to screen candidate agents, such as a panel of antibodies or chimeric 
antigen receptors, for their ability to induce cellular cytotoxicity against a panel of cell lines to select the candidate 
with the highest on-target and the least off-target activity. Similarly, the assay can be used to monitor toxicity on 
normal healthy cells and tissues. The assay may also be used to screen for compounds that can modulate cellular 
cytotoxicity induced by antibodies, bispecific antibodies and cellular therapy products. Having an established 
potency assay is an FDA requirement for Biological License Application (BLA) for manufacturing of cellular 
therapy products. Based on its sensitivity, specificity, speed, and convenience, the Matador assay can be a useful 
potency assay at various steps involved in the manufacturing of cellular therapy products. The utility of the assay, 
however, is not limited to immunotherapeutics, and it can potentially have broad applicability in multiple areas 
such as screening for small molecule compounds, anticancer agents and environmental toxins. Studies are cur-
rently underway to adapt the assay for such applications.
Materials and Methods
Construction of retro-and lentiviral based luciferase expression vectors. 
Luciferase constructs 
used in this study were designed to lack a secretory signal. The nucleotide sequences encoding luciferases from 
Gaussia princeps (Gluc)25, Nanoluc engineered from Oplophorus gracilorostris (Nluc)7, Metridia longa (Mluc7)19, 
Lucicutia Ovaliformis (Loluc)11, Plueromamma abdominalis (Paluc1)11, and Heterorhabdus tanneri (Htluc1)11 
was obtained from GenBank. Tluc16 engineered from the marine copepod Metridia family was obtained from 
ThermoFisher Scientific. All the luciferases were codon optimized and gene-fragments encoding the optimized 
sequences were synthesized by GeneArtTM or Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT). The MLuc7 cDNA also car-
ried M43L and M110L substitutions. The corresponding substitutions in GLuc have been previously shown to 
result in Glow type luminescence suitable for high throughput applications. The gene fragments were used as tem-
plates in PCR reactions using custom primers to amplify the corresponding DNAs, which were then cloned in dif-
ferent expression vectors using standard molecular biology techniques. In some cases, the fragments were cloned 
in-frame with nucleotide sequences encoding different epitope tags, such as FLAG, ×
3FLAG, AcV5 and HA. 
Some of the constructs also co-expressed antibiotic resistance genes in frame with the cDNAs encoding the lucif-
erases and separated from them by 2A ribosomal skip sequences. Essentially a similar strategy was used to clone 
Fluc and Rluc except the plasmids encoding the corresponding cDNAs were used as template in PCR reactions. 
The pLenti-Blast vector was derived from pLenti6v5gw_lacz vector (Invitrogen; ThermoFisher Scientific) by 
removal of the lacZ gene. pLenti-MP2 was a gift from Pantelis Tsoulfas (Addgene plasmid # 36097) and was used 
to generate the pLenti-EF1α
 lentiviral vector by replacement of the CMV promoter with human EF1α
 promoter 
using standard molecular biology techniques. psPAX2 was a gift from Didier Trono (Addgene plasmid # 12260).

The pLP/VSVG envelope plasmid and 293FT cells were obtained from Invitrogen (ThermoFisher Scientific). The 
retroviral transfer vector MSCVneo, MSCVhygro, and MSCVpac and the packaging vector pKAT were obtained 
from Dr. Robert Illaria’s laboratory. phRGTK Renilla Luciferase plasmid was from Promega.
Construction of lentiviral based chimeric antigen receptors (CARs). 
To construct lentiviral vectors 
encoding FMC63-BBz Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR), the gene fragment encoding FMC63 CAR was synthe-
sized by GeneArtTM using the published sequence of FMC63 scFv26. The gene fragment was then used as template 
in a PCR reaction to amplify the sequence which was then cloned in to a lentiviral vector driven by an EF1α
 
promoter and in frame with T2A ribosomal skip sequence followed by eGFP nucleotide sequence using standard 
molecular biology techniques. The resulting construct was labeled pLenti-EF1α
-FMC63-MYC-BBz-T2A-eGFP. 
A lentiviral construct, pLenti-EF1α
-FMC63-MYC-BBz-T2A-Pac was also constructed by replacement of eGFP 
gene with a puromycin resistance gene (Pac).
Cell lines and reagents. 
K562 (Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia), Raji (Burkitt’s lymphoma), HEL 92.1.7 
(Erythroleukemia) and NK92MI cell lines were obtained from ATCC and maintained as per the instructions 
provided. Nalm6 (Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia), BC-1 (Primary effusion lymphoma), and KG-1 (Acute 
myelogenous leukemia) cell lines were kindly provided by Drs. Markus Muschen, Jae Jung, and Alan Epstein, 
respectively. 293FT cells were obtained from Invitrogen (ThermoFisher Scientific) and cultured as recommended. 
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated by Ficoll gradient method from platelet depleted 
donor cells obtained from a Blood Bank. PBMCs were subsequently used to isolate T cells using CD3 magnetic 
microbeads (Miltenyi Biotech) following the manufacturer’s instructions. T cells were cultured in XVIVO-15 
(Lonza) medium supplemented with 100 IU/ml recombinant human IL2 and 30 ng/ml soluble antibodies to 
human CD3 and CD28. All the cells were cultured at 37 °C, in a 5% CO2 humidified incubator. Blinatumomab 
was obtained from Amgen, Rituximab was obtained from Genentech. Digitonin, and Polybrene were from Sigma. 
Coelenterazine was purchased from Nanolight technology. Calcein AM fluorescent dye was obtained from BD 
biosciences.
Preparation of retro-and lentivirus supernatants. 
Lentiviruses and retroviruses were generated in 
293FT cells essentially as described previously27. For lentivirus production, 10 micrograms (μ
g) of lentiviral 
expression plasmid was used along with 7.5 μ
g of PSPAX2 and 2 μ
g of PLP/VSVG plasmid as packaging vector for 
a 100 mm plate (containing 10 ml media). Lentiviral titer was checked by measuring the amount of p24 antigen 
in concentrated viral supernatant. Essentially a similar procedure was used for production of retroviruses except 
4 μ
g of pKAT and 2 μ
g of VSVG plasmids were used as packaging vectors.
Transient transfection of 293FT cells with retro-and lentiviral based luciferase expression vectors. 
 
The 293FT cells were transfected in a 24-well plate with various expression plasmids (500 ng/well) using cal-
cium phosphate as described previously28. Approximately, 18 hours post-transfection, the cells were either left 
untreated or treated with 30 μ
g/ml digitonin to induce cell death, followed by the detection of luminescence as 
described under luciferase assays.
Generation of stable cancer cell lines expressing various luciferases. 
Stable cell lines expressing 
the different luciferase reporters were generated by infecting approximately 0.5 ×
 106 cells in 1 ml of medium with 
2 ml of viral supernatant in the presence of polybrene (8 μ
g/ml) in a 6-well plate by spin-infection (1800 rpm for 
90 minutes at 37 °C). Next morning, the cells were pelleted and re-suspended in media with respective antibiotics 
for selection of stably transduced cells.
Infection of primary human T-cells with chimeric antigen receptor encoding viruses. 
Second 
generation CAR constructs co-expressing a puromycin resistance gene were used to infect primary human T cells. 
The lentiviral supernatants were concentrated by centrifugation at 18,500 rpm for 2 hours at 4 °C. The viral pellets 
were re-suspended in 1/10 of the initial volume and stored at −
80 °C. In general, primary T cells were infected 
using spin-infection as mentioned earlier, except 2 ×
 106 cells/2 ml with 300 μ
l of concentrated virus in the pres-
ence of polybrene in morning. The media was changed in the evening and the infection was repeated for two more 
days for a total of 3 infections. After the 3rd infection, the cells were pelleted and re-suspended in complete T-cell 
media with puromycin (400 ng/ml).
Generation of NK92MI cells stably expressing CARs. 
NK92MI cells stably expressing second gen-
eration CAR constructs and coexpressing eGFP were generated by infecting with concentrated lentiviruses as 
described for primary human T cells. The eGFP positive cells were sorted using BD FACSAria II and expanded.
Luciferase assays. 
Coelenterazine (CTZ) was used as a substrate to measure luminescence in cells express-
ing Gluc, Nluc, Mluc7, Tluc16, Paluc1, Htluc1, Loluc and Rluc using a CTZ-assay buffer containing 20 μ
M CTZ 
in PBS29. CTZ stock solution (2 mM) was made with acidified methanol as recommended by the manufacturer. 
Fluc activity was determined as described earlier30,31 by adding Fluc assay buffer (1 mM D-Luciferin, 25 mM 
Gly-Gly, 15 mM potassium phosphate, 15 mM MgSO4, 4 mM EGTA, 2 mM ATP, and 1 mM DTT). Unless indi-
cated otherwise, the assay buffer with substrate was added to cell culture media at 1:1 or at 1:4 ratio (v/v) for all 
luciferase assays. Luminescence was read in endpoint mode using BioTek synergy H4 hybrid microplate reader 
for 10 seconds. Percentage Specific lysis was calculated using the luciferase activity of digitonin-treated cells as 
maximum cell death and untreated cells as spontaneous cell death and using the formula % specific lysis = 100 ×
 
[(experimental data −
 spontaneous cell death)/(maximum cell death −
 spontaneous cell death)].

LDH release assay. 
LDH release was measured using the CytoTox 96® Non-Radioactive assay kit (Promega). 
Briefly, cells were plated in the 96-well U bottom plate in phenol red-free medium and treated with cell death 
inducing agents or media (control). Post treatment, the plates were spun at 250 g for 4 minutes. Supernatants were 
carefully transferred into a flat bottom plate followed by the calorimetric detection of LDH activity as described 
in the manufacturer protocol.
Calcein-release assay. 
Target cells were washed twice with phenol red free medium and re-suspended at 
1 ×
 106 per ml in medium containing 10 μ
M Calcein-AM, and incubated for 30 minutes at 37 °C. Post incubation, 
cells were washed twice with phenol red-free medium and plated in the 96-well U bottom plate, and treated with 
cell death inducing agents or media (control). Post treatment, the plates were spun at 250 g for 4 minutes, super-
natants were carefully transferred to a black walled flat bottom plate and fluorescence (Excitation 485 ± 9 nm, 
Emission 530 ± 9 nm) was read in a Biotek Synergy Plate Reader.
Culture and transduction of primary patient samples. 
De-identified primary patient samples were 
collected under an IRB approved protocol and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Cells were thawed and cultured over-
night in RPMI containing 40% FBS, followed by removal of dead cells by Ficoll-Hypaque gradient centrifugation. 
4 ×
 106 cells were spin-infected with pLenti-Pac-Gluc at an MOI of 10 in the presence of polybrene (8 µg/mL). 
After 12–16 hours, cells were spun down and placed in fresh media. Cells were used for experiments 48 hours post 
infection. For CHTR-136, freshly isolated cells were used and cultured in primary T cell culture media (XVIVO-
15 medium supplemented with 100 IU/ml recombinant human IL2, 30 ng/ml soluble antibodies to human CD3 
and CD28).
Fugene HD transfection. 
For transient transfection of K562 and Raji cells, Fugene HD transfection reagent 
(Promega) was used. After 48 hours, cells were plated at a density of 100 K cells/well in a white 384-well plate 
either alone or in the presence of the effector cells (NK92MI for K562 and FMC63-CAR-Ts for Raji) for 4 hours. 
The luminescence was measured as described earlier under luciferase assays.
Statistical analysis. 
Two-tailed unpaired Student t test was used to test for differences between 2 groups 
using GraphPad Prism 5 software. Differences with a P ≤
 0.05 were considered statistically significant. All exper-
iments were repeated a minimum of two times.
