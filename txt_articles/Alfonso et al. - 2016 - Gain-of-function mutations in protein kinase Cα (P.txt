Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a progressive dementia disorder characterized by synaptic degeneration and
amyloid-b (Ab) accumulation in the brain. Through whole-genome sequencing of 1345 individuals from 410
families with late-onset AD (LOAD), we identified three highly penetrant variants in PRKCA, the gene that
encodes protein kinase Ca (PKCa), in five of the families. All three variants linked with LOAD displayed
increased catalytic activity relative to wild-type PKCa as assessed in live-cell imaging experiments using
a genetically encoded PKC activity reporter. Deleting PRKCA in mice or adding PKC antagonists to mouse
hippocampal slices infected with a virus expressing the Ab precursor CT100 revealed that PKCa was re-
quired for the reduced synaptic activity caused by Ab. In PRKCA−/− neurons expressing CT100, introduction
of PKCa, but not PKCa lacking a PDZ interaction moiety, rescued synaptic depression, suggesting that a
scaffolding interaction bringing PKCa to the synapse is required for its mediation of the effects of Ab. Thus,
enhanced PKCa activity may contribute to AD, possibly by mediating the actions of Ab on synapses. In con-
trast, reduced PKCa activity is implicated in cancer. Hence, these findings reinforce the importance of main-
taining a careful balance in the activity of this enzyme.
INTRODUCTION
Alzheimer’
s disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by
progressive cognitive decline. Synaptic degeneration is among the earliest
manifestations of AD inhumans (1, 2) and is an earlyevent in rodent models
of AD (3–5). The loss of synapses may result from increased abundance of
amyloid-b (Ab) (6–8), a peptide that is associated with the development of
AD (9). Familial forms of AD (hereditary early-onset AD), which account
for less than 10% of AD cases, are caused by mutations in genes encoding
amyloidprecursor protein (APP) or b- and g-secretases (enzymes that cleave
APP) that result in increased abundance of the most toxic form of Ab (9).
The risk for late-onset AD (LOAD), which accounts for most AD cases, is
increased in individuals expressing a variant of apolipoprotein E (APOE)
called APOE-e4 (10), which may be less effective than other APOE alleles
atpromotingtheremovalof Ab (9).Additionalfactors,suchasinnateimmunity,
namely, the AD-associated genes CD33 and TREM2, also play a role (11, 12).
We sought to identify other genes that contribute to LOAD because their
gene products may serve as therapeutic targets. We reasoned that variants of
proteins participating in the detrimental effects of Ab may contribute to the
disease. We thus examined the signaling underlying Ab-induced synaptic
depression. We focused on the multi-isozyme protein kinase C (PKC)
family (13) because an interacting partner of the isozyme PKCa, PKC-
binding protein (PICK1), is required for the synaptic effects of Ab (14),
and additionally, PKCa is required for a plasticity form of synaptic depres-
sion (15). The role of PKC isozymes in cancer is complex, but the finding
that many cancer-associated mutations in PKC isozymes are actually loss of
function indicates that reduced PKC activity contributes to increased cell
survival (16). Therefore, we speculated that increased PKC activity could
participate in the synaptic loss seen in AD.
RESULTS
PKCa is necessary for the synaptic effects of Ab
To test whether the activity of PKC contributes to Ab-induced synaptic de-
pression, we added PKC antagonists to rodent organotypic hippocampal
slices infected sparsely with a virus expressing CT100, which increases
Ab production by neurons (6, 8, 17). CT100 is the product of APP cleavage
by b-secretase; CT100 is subsequently cleaved by g-secretase to produce Ab
(18). After 16 to 24 hours, we evoked synaptic transmission by electrically
stimulating presynaptic axons, and recordings were simultaneously ob-
tained from neighboring infected and uninfected postsynaptic hippocampal
CA1 neurons. Infected neurons (that expressed CT100) exhibited depressed
excitatory transmission relative to that in uninfected neurons (Fig. 1A). Pre-
vious studies have shown that the effects of CT100 expression are due to the
subsequent production of Ab that induces the endocytosis of glutamate re-
ceptors and loss of synapses (6, 8, 17). To examine the role of PKC in Ab-
dependent synaptic depression, we incubated hippocampal slices (for
~12 hours before recordings) with the PKC inhibitors Gö 6983, an adeno-
sine 5′-triphosphate (ATP) competitive inhibitor, or bisindolylmaleimide IV
(Bis IV), an uncompetitive inhibitor; these inhibitors inhibit conventional
(such as PKCa) and novel PKC isozymes. Synaptic depression by CT100

 expression was effectively blocked by Bis IV but not by Gö 6983 (Fig. 1, A
and B). Because PKC is refractory to active-site inhibitors when it is bound
to a scaffold protein near its substrates (19), these data suggest that scaffold
protein–bound PKC may mediate the synaptic effects of Ab. Of the PKC
isozymes that are modulated by these inhibitors, only PKCa has a PDZ
ligand, a three–amino acid segment at its C terminus that binds the PDZ
domains of scaffolding proteins [notably PSD95, SAP97, and PICK1
(20, 21)]. Expression of CKAR, a genetically encoded fluorescence-based
reporter of bulk PKC activity (22), in COS7 cells revealed that endogenous
PKC activity at the PSD95 scaffold was effectively inhibited by Bis IV but
not Gö 6983, whereas both inhibitors were equally effective at inhibiting
bulk PKC activity measured at plasma membrane (Fig. 1C).
To test whether PKCa specifically mediates the synaptic effects of Ab,
organotypic hippocampal slices were prepared from wild-type mice and
mice lacking PKCa (PRKCA−/−) (23). Sixteen to 24 hours after infection,
neurons expressing CT100 displayed depressed synaptic transmission com-
pared to nearby neurons in slices from wild-type mice but showed no
difference in PRKCA−/− slices (Fig. 2, A and B). Western blot analysis re-
vealedcomparablelevelsofAb peptideinlysatesfromslicesfromPRKCA−/−
or wild-type animals infected with virus expressing CT100 (fig. S1). To
determine whether absence of PKCa, rather than some developmental al-
teration in PRKCA−/− mice, was responsible for the lack of effect by CT100
in neurons from PRKCA−/− mice, we used a dual promoter virus to coexpress
CT100 and PKCa in PRKCA−/− organotypic slices. After expression, trans-
mission onto infected neurons was depressed compared to noninfected neu-
rons,indicating rescueof theeffect ofCT100onsynapses (Fig.2A). To ensure
the rescue of CT100-induced depression by PKCa coexpression was not due
to potentiation of transmission by PKCa expression (which when added to the
CT100-induced synaptic depression could normalize transmission), we coex-
pressed PKCa with CT84, the a-secretase product of APP that neither gener-
ates Ab (18) nor causes synaptic depression (24). In this case, no significant
potentiation was observed (Fig. 2A), indicating that PKCa coexpression res-
cuedtheeffectsofCT100byenablingCT100-drivensignaling. Totest whether
the effects of Ab on synapses require that PKCa act at a scaffold, as suggested
by the pharmacological results above, we coexpressed CT100 and a mutant
form of PKCa that lacked the last three amino acids [PKCa (DPDZ)], which
prevents its binding to PDZ domain proteins. In contrast to the coexpression of
PKCa, coexpression of PKCa (DPDZ) did not rescue the effects of CT100
expression (Fig. 2A). These results indicate that PKCa, likely acting at a scaf-
fold, is required for the depressive effects of Ab on rodent synapses.
Whole-genome sequencing reveals PKCa variants in AD
To test whether PKCa plays a role in human AD, we searched whole-
genome sequencing data for rare variants in PRKCA that were present in
anyof the410pedigreesfromtheNationalInstituteofMentalHealth(NIMH)
Alzheimer’
s Disease Genetics Initiative (Fig. 3 and fig. S2). We identified
three rarevariants found in LOAD patients in these families. M489V [single
nucleotide polymorphism: rs34406842; codon substitution: Atg/Gtg; minor
allele frequency = 0.0005 in 1000 genomes of the general population
(www.1000genomes.org)] was present in seven of nine affected individuals
and was absent in the single unaffected subject in these four families. V636I
(rs141376042; Gtc/Atc; minor allele frequency = 0.002 in 1000 genomes)
was present in two of three affected subjects in one family in which no data
from unaffected subjects were available. R324W (minor allele frequency =
0.00 in 1000 genomes) was present in one of two affected individuals and
missing in the unaffected individual in a single LOAD pedigree. Thus, all
individuals carrying a PRKCA variant developed AD, and all the indivi-
duals in these families who did not carry a PRKCAvariant did not develop
AD. Thus, the PRKCAvariants identified in the NIMH data set appear to cose-
gregate with LOAD patients. A simple bootstrap test (see Materials and

ulation is less than 0.03.
AD-linked PKCa variants display increased
cellular activity
Given that PKCa activity mediated the synaptic effects of increased abun-
dance of Ab (Figs. 1 and 2), we hypothesized that the rare PKCa variants
found in LOAD families would have increased activity. This view is
also suggested by the findings that reduced PKC function enhances
survival in some cancer cells (16), whereas neuronal loss is seen in
AD. Two of the rare variants observed in LOAD patients occur in
key regulatory segments of the PKC family (13): M489V is in the activa-
tion loop near the entrance to the active site, and V636I is on the C-
terminal segment that clamps over the kinase domain (Fig. 4A). Both
segments interface with the Ca2+-sensing C2 domain, which maintains
PKCa in an autoinhibited conformation (25). Thus, both mutations have
the potential to destabilize autoinhibition. For example, molecular
modeling reveals that replacement of the bulky Met at position 489 on
the activation loop with the smaller Val loosens the packing of this key
regulatory segment (Fig. 4A), consistent with reduced autoinhibition.
Additionally, this residue is close to a segment in the kinase architecture,
referred to as DFG +1, that is a key specificity determinant (26), and
mutations in this region have been shown to alter substrate specificity
in another PKC, PKCg (27). The third variant, R324W
, is also in a seg-
ment that controls autoinhibition; it is present in a flexible hinge, con-
necting the kinase domain with the regulatory moiety, that becomes
exposed upon rupture of the C2-kinase domain contacts accompanying
activation (25).
To examine the functional impact of amino acid changes, we assessed
the effect of introducing these LOAD-associated rare variants on the
function of PKCa. When expressed in COS7 cells, none of the three rare
variants affected the phosphorylation of PKCa at priming sites that are in-
dicative of proper protein folding (28), as assessed by Western blot analysis
using phosphospecific antibodies (Fig. 4B). Further analysis of the M489V
mutant revealed an increased rate of dephosphorylation after cells were stim-
ulated with phorbol esters (Fig. 4C), potent activators that force PKCs into
an open phosphatase-sensitive conformation (29). This enhanced rate of de-
phosphorylation supports the looser packing of the kinase domain resulting
from replacement of Met with Val, favoring a more open (meaning active)
conformation of the kinase when challenged with phorbol esters (30). The
V636I mutant did not display the same enhanced rate of dephosphorylation,
indicating that there may be other structural mechanisms through which this
mutation destabilizes PKC autoinhibition.
To assess the effect of the amino acid changes on the signaling output of
PKCa, we coexpressed PKCa variants or wild-type PKCa with cytosolic
CKAR (22) in COS7 cells. All three rarevariants showed enhanced agonist-
evoked activity relative towild-type PKCa (Fig. 5). This assay measures the
phosphorylation of CKAR andreflects the allosteric activationof PKCinduced
by second messenger binding. This acute stimulation by natural agonists

 does not cause the dephosphorylation or down-regulation of PKC that is
caused by chronic activation by phorbol esters. These results indicate that
all three rare PKCa variants found to cosegregate with LOAD display
increased agonist-driven PKCa function.
DISCUSSION
AD is a lethal neurodegenerative disorder with increasing prevalence and no
effective treatment (9). Elucidatingthe cellular signaling events that underlie
the initiation and progression of LOAD can provide potential targets ame-
nable to therapeutic intervention. Human genetic studies (31), particularly
family-based studies (10) of rare variants (32), can identify potentially im-
portant molecules in LOAD. However, delineation of LOAD patho-
physiology primarily from genetic information from smaller family
studies remains challenging [see published comments and responses to
(32)]. We therefore sought to combine a largegenetic family study with neu-
rophysiological and biochemical analyses to elucidate the signaling
underlying LOAD pathophysiology.
PKCa and AD pathophysiology
Although the cellular events that initiate LOAD remain unknown (9),
increased accumulation of pathogenic forms of Ab and the associated syn-
aptic loss are strongly implicated in its early pathophysiology (1, 2, 33, 34).
Various PKC isozymes have been implicated in AD in a number of studies
(35–38). Supporting a role for enhanced signaling by PKC in AD, a recent
phosphoproteomics study of postmortem brains identified increased phos-
phorylation of PKC substrates as a primary early event in AD (39). How-
ever, the role of PKC is not yet well understood. Understanding the
biological functions of PKC in disease in general has presented a challenge
given the presence of multiple isozymes and the opposing effects of phorbol
esters in mediating short-term activation and long-term down-regulation.
By combining the use of pharmacology, mouse genetics, and acute rescue
experiments in this study, we can conclude the role of a specific PKC iso-
zyme: our neurophysiological studies indicate that PKCa and its interaction
with a protein through a PDZ domain interaction are required for Ab to pro-
duce synaptic depression [consistent with a previous study demonstrating a
requirement of PICK1 (14), a PDZ domain protein that binds PKCa]. Given
the evidence supporting Ab and synaptic loss in AD, our results suggest an
important role for PKCa in AD.
Because conclusions regarding human disease based on physiology
fromimmaturerodent brainslices aretenuous,weturned tohumangenetics,
which can provide insight into the function of aberrant PKCa signaling in
disease. By scanning the genomes of individuals from a large LOAD family
study, we identified three rare variants of PKCa that cosegregated with
LOAD in six families. When examined in cell-based assays, all three var-
iants displayed increased signaling output relative to wild-type PKCa. No-
tably, of the 46 PKC variants observed in cancers and tested for changed
activity using the same assays, none displayed increased activity (16). Fur-
thermore, the more strongly linked M489V mutation, found in seven of nine
patients and not in anunaffectedsubject in four LOAD families, alsoelicited
an enhanced rate of dephosphorylation after stimulation of cells with phor-
bol esters, consistent with a more open and signaling competent conforma-
tion. Thus, PKCa is required for deleterious synaptic effects of Ab,
observed early in LOAD, and increased PKCa activity can contribute to
human LOAD.

 PKCa activity: Increased in neurodegeneration and
decreased in cancer
It is notable that we found activating PKC mutations in LOAD patients,
whereas functional human cancer-associated PKC mutations are inactivating
(16). The neurodegenerative disease, spinocerebellar ataxia, is caused by
mutations in PKCg that promote the open active conformation (40). Thus,
our results are consistent with PKC gain-of-function mutations driving neu-
rodegenerative diseases and loss-of-function mutations driving cell survival
diseases. Supporting opposing roles of PKC in cancer versus AD, a recent
meta-analysis of nine independent studies reveals that AD patients exhibit
an overall 45% decreased risk of cancer compared with the general popu-
lation (41), consistent with earlier reports that AD and cancer display an
inverse association (42, 43). It is relevant that inhibitors of PKC have failed
in cancer clinical trials (44), likely because PKC activity should be restored,
rather than inhibited, in cancer therapy (16). In contrast, repurposing PKC
inhibitors for LOAD may prevent the effects of Ab on synapses and thereby
mitigate loss of cognitive function. Together, our findings support inhibition
of PKCa as a therapy early in LOAD and suggest that mutations in PKCa
can serve as a diagnostic for disease susceptibility.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Tissue preparation
Experiments were conducted in accordance with and received approval
from the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees at the University
of California, San Diego. The experiments were carried out in accordance
with guidelines laid down by the National Institutes of Health regarding the
care and use of animals for experimental procedures.
Hippocampal slice cultures and Sindbis virus infection
Organotypic hippocampal slice cultures were made from postnatal day 6 or
7 rat pups as described (45). Slice cultures were maintained in culture for 6
to 8 days and then infected using a Sindbis virus (pSinRep5 dp APP-CT100
tdTomato). Cells were recorded 16 to 30 hours after infection. For Fig. 2
experiments, slices were made as described above, but from either wild-type
or PRKCA−/− mouse pups and infected with the indicated Sindbis viruses.
Electrophysiology and pharmacological treatments
Slices were maintained in a solution of artificial cerebrospinal fluid con-
taining the following: 119 mM NaCl, 26 mM NaHCO3, 1 mM NaH2PO4,
11 mM D-glucose, 2.5 mM KCl, 4 mM CaCl2, 4 mM MgCl2, and 1.25 mM
NaHPO4 and gassed with 95% O2 5% CO2. In addition, the following drugs
were included: 4 mM 2-chloroadenosine (to prevent stimulus induced
bursting) and 100 mM picrotoxin (to block inhibitory transmission). For
Figs. 1 and 2, simultaneous whole-cell recordings were obtained from pairs
of neighboring (<50 mm) control andinfected CA1 pyramidal neurons using
3- to 5-megohm glass pipettes with an internal solution containing the
following: 115 mM cesium methanesulfonate, 20 mM CsCl, 10 mM Hepes,
2.5 mM MgCl2, 4 mM Na2ATP
, 0.4 mM Na3GTP
, 10 mM sodium phos-
phocreatine, 0.6 mM EGTA, and 0.1 mM spermine, at pH 7.25. All record-
ings were done by stimulating two independent synaptic inputs; EPSCs
were recorded while holding the cells at −60 mV
, alternating pathways every
8.4 s. Results from each pathway were averaged and counted as n = 1. For
pharmacological experiments, slices were incubated overnight before record-
ings with either 0.3 mM Gö 6983 or 3 mM Bis IV; the drug was also added to

Plasmid constructs
The CKAR and plasma membrane–localized PKC reporter were described
previously (22). The PSD95-specific PKC reporter (PSD95-CKAR)
contains CKAR with PSD95 fused to its N terminus via a four–amino acid
linker (EPGQ) in a pcDNA3 vector (Life Technologies). PKC constructs
were prepared as described previously (16). For HA-PKCa, human PKCa
was N-terminally HA-tagged via Gateway cloning into pDEST
-HA gener-
ated from ligating the reading frame cassette C into the EcoRV site of
pcDNA3-HA. All mutants were generated using QuikChange site-directed
mutagenesis (Agilent Technologies).
Antibodies and reagents
The pan antibody against the phosphorylated PKC activation loop (pT497)
was previously described (47). The antibody to phosphorylated PKCa/bII
(pT638/641; 9375S) and pan antibody to the phosphorylated PKC hydro-
phobic motif (bII pS660; 9371S) were purchased from Cell Signaling Tech-
nology. The a-HA antibody (anti-HA; 11867423001, clone 3F10) was
purchased from Roche. PDBu, UTP trisodium salt, Gö 6983, and Bis IV
were obtained from Calbiochem.
Cell culture, transfection, and immunoblotting
All cells were maintained in Dulbecco’
s modified Eagle’
s medium (Corning)
containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Atlanta Biologicals) and 1% penicillin/
streptomycin (Corning) at 37°C, in 5% CO2. Transient transfection of COS7
was carried out using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche) for ~24 hours.

,10mM
Na4P2O7, 100 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 1 mM Na3VO4, 1 mM phenylmethyl-
sulfonyl fluoride, leupeptin (50 mg/ml), 1 mM microcystin, 1 mM dithio-
threitol, and 2 mM benzamidine. For PKC immunoblotting, whole-cell
lysates were analyzed by SDS–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-
PAGE) and immunoblotting via chemiluminescence on a FluorChem Q im-
aging system (ProteinSimple). For cellular dephosphorylation experiments,
cells were treated with 200 nM PDBu for the indicated times at 37°C before
lysis. For Ab immunoblotting, 10 mg of protein per samplewas electrophoresed
on 10 to 20% SDS–polyacrylamide tris-tricine gels (Bio-Rad). Proteins were
transferredtonitrocellulose,andmembraneswereboiledinphosphate-buffered
saline for 5 min. Membranes were blocked in TBST(tris-buffered saline–
Tween 20) containing 5% bovine serum albumin (#A3803, Sigma; >98%
grade) for 1 hour at room temperature and probed with biotinylated 6E10
(BioLegend; 1:2500) or APPCter (#A8717, Sigma; 1:5000) in blocking so-
lution. Primary antibodies were detected using anti–immunoglobulin G
conjugated with either biotin or infrared dyes (LI-COR Biosciences). When
biotin-conjugatedantibodieswereused,DyLight800–conjugatedNeutrAvidin
(#22853, Thermo Scientific) was added to amplify the signal. Blots were
imaged with an Odyssey detection system (LI-COR Biosciences).
Immunoprecipitation
Protein extract (200 mg) was diluted to 1 ml with dilution buffer [50 mM
tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mM NaCl] and incubated with 25 ml of MagG beads
(Roche) cross-linked with 5 mg of 4G8 overnight at 4°C. The following day,
immune complexes were briefly washed with immunoprecipitation buffers

FRET imaging and analysis
Cells were imaged as described previously (49). COS7 cells were cotrans-
fected with the indicated mCherry-tagged PKC and either CKAR, plasma
membrane–targeted CKAR, or PSD95-CKAR, as specified. Cells were
rinsed once with and imaged in Hanks’ balanced salt solution containing
1 mM CaCl2. Images were acquired on a Zeiss Axiovert microscope (Carl
Zeiss Microimaging Inc.) using a MicroMax digital camera (Roper-Princeton
Instruments) controlled by MetaFluor software (Universal Imaging Corp.).
Using a 10% neutral density filter, cyan fluorescent protein, yellow fluores-
cent protein (YFP), fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET), and
mCherry images were obtained every 15 s. YFP emission was monitored
as a control for photobleaching, and mCherry was measured to ensure that
overexpressed PKC levels were equal in all experiments. Baseline images
were acquired for ≥2 min before ligand addition, and data were normalized
to the baseline FRET ratios. The normalized average FRET ratio is the aver-
age of these normalized values ± SE. Area under the curve from 3 to 6 min
was quantified and plotted in the bar graph in Fig. 5, and statistical signifi-
cance was determined as indicated above.
Three-dimensional PKC structure modeling: The PKCa structure
was visualized using the PyMOL Molecular Graphics System (version
1.7.4.1, Schrödinger LLC.).
Genetics, family cohort
The NIMH Alzheimer’
s Disease Genetics Initiative Study (50), originally
ascertained for the study of genetic risk factors in AD with family-based
methods, was used in the whole-genome shotgun (WGS) analyses in this
study. The basis for ascertainment in the NIMH collection was the existence
ofatleasttwoaffectedindividualswithinafamily,typicallysiblings.Thecom-
plete NIMH study cohort contains a total of 1536 subjects from 457 families.
For the purpose of this analysis, only subjects of self-reported European an-
cestry were included, consisting of 1376 participants (941 definitely affected
and 404 definitely unaffected, and the remainder could not be determined as
definitely unaffected or definitely affected) from 410 families.
To test the likelihood of finding the observed linkage in the mutant
carrier families by chance, we conducted the following bootstrap analysis.
We generated a “parent” set containing 941 ones (indicating affected) and
404 zeros (indicating unaffected), which is the nature of the definitely as-
sessed population in this cohort. We wished to test the likelihood that
choosing a set of 16 individuals (based on being in a family with a mutant
protein) would show the observed linkage, that is, the likelihood that in
choosing 10 individuals (variant carriers) all would have AD, and that in
choosing 6 individuals (variant noncarriers) at least 2 would not have
AD. We conducted the following sampling (allowing resampling) procedure:
we chose 10 and 6 elements from the parent set to generate two subsets, y(1)
and y(2). We then tested if all values in y(1) were 1 (test 1) and at least two
values iny(2) were 0 (test2). If both tests were true, the result of the procedure
was1(meaningchancecouldaccountfor observedlinkage);if anyof thetests
was false, the result of the procedure was 0. This procedure was conducted
100,000 times (run four times). The number of times the result of the
procedure was 1 in the four runs was 2750, 2809, 2920, and 2861. Thus
(dividing these values by 100,000), the likelihood of finding the ob-
served linkage distribution by chance in this population is <0.03.
Standard protocol approvals, registrations, and
patient consents
Diagnosis of AD dementia was established according to NINCDA-ADRDA
criteria. Informed consent was provided by all participants, and research ap-
proval was established by the relevant institutional review boards in the study
cohort.
WGS data generation
Three micrograms of total genomic DNA (150 ng/ml) obtained from Rutgers
repository was sequenced at Illumina Inc. using their latest HiSeq 2500
paired-end sequencing platform. An average of 48× coverage of 98% of
the genome was observed in the resulting 120-gigabyte data from each sample.
Genomic variants were called in-house using FreeBayes (v0.9.9.2-18) and
GATK best practices method (51), resulting in close to 400 terabytes of
high-quality sequencing data in a fully annotated GEMINI database (52).
