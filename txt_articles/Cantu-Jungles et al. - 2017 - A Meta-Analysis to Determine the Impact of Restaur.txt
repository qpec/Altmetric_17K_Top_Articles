Abstract: A systematic review and meta-analysis determined the effect of restaurant menu labeling
on calories and nutrients chosen in laboratory and away-from-home settings in U.S. adults.
Cochrane-based criteria adherent, peer-reviewed study designs conducted and published in the
English language from 1950 to 2014 were collected in 2015, analyzed in 2016, and used to evaluate
the effect of nutrition labeling on calories and nutrients ordered or consumed. Before and after menu
labeling outcomes were used to determine weighted mean differences in calories, saturated fat, total
fat, carbohydrate, and sodium ordered/consumed which were pooled across studies using random
effects modeling. Stratified analysis for laboratory and away-from-home settings were also completed.
Menu labeling resulted in no significant change in reported calories ordered/consumed in studies
with full criteria adherence, nor the 14 studies analyzed with ≤1 unmet criteria, nor for change in
total ordered carbohydrate, fat, and saturated fat (three studies) or ordered or consumed sodium
(four studies). A significant reduction of 115.2 calories ordered/consumed in laboratory settings
was determined when analyses were stratified by study setting. Menu labeling away-from-home
did not result in change in quantity or quality, specifically for carbohydrates, total fat, saturated fat,
or sodium, of calories consumed among U.S. adults.

1. Introduction
Excess adiposity contributing to the “obesity epidemic” is a public health concern in the United
States [1–4]. In 2011–2012, more than two-thirds (approximately 68.5%) of adults were overweight
or obese (defined as a body mass index ≥25) [5], an approximate 12% increase since 1988–1994 [6].
The financial burden associated with the U.S. overweight/obesity prevalence combined is estimated
at approximately 5–10% of total healthcare costs annually [7]. Obesity is also associated with an
increased risk of morbidity for several health conditions, including hypertension [8–12], type 2
diabetes [13–16], and cardiovascular disease [17–20] among U.S. adults. Many factors may contribute
to the prevalence of overweight and obesity, including environment, genetics, and behavior choices,
such as physical activity and diet including excess caloric intake [1,20–22]. Food consumed away from

home, including foods from table-service restaurants, cafeterias, taverns, and fast food [23], may be
one such contributing factor.
U.S. consumer spending on food away-from-home has increased since the mid-1990s and is
expected to continue to increase by approximately 18% at full-service restaurants and 6% at fast-food
restaurants between 2000 and 2020, indicating the importance of away-from-home foods to U.S. dietary
intake [24]. The availability of fruits and vegetables, whole grains, and low-fat milk in restaurants is
limited according to an evaluation of the nutrition environment in the away-from-home setting [25].
Foods purchased away from home tend to have high energy per nutrient density when compared
with foods consumed at home. Main and side dishes at sit down and fast-food restaurant chains
consistently contained high amounts of fat, saturated fat and sodium, and low amounts of fiber and
fruits/vegetables [26]. An evaluation of approximately 3500 meals at 34 of the top 50 U.S. restaurant
chains showed that 91% of meals did not meet dietary standards created by the National Restaurant
Association [27]. Thus, although food prepared away from home accounts for a significant share of
U.S. food consumption, it may exert a disproportionately larger influence on the intake of nutrients of
public health concern compared with food prepared at home [28–30].
Several studies have proposed that food prepared away from home may be a contributor to
overweight and obesity in the U.S. [29,31–35]. Consumers were poor estimators of the calories
contained in restaurant food items [36–38] and the consumption of food away from home was positively
associated with caloric intake [31]. The lack of nutrition information in restaurant establishments
was given as a reason for consumer difficulty in making healthy choices, suggesting a need for
menu labeling [31]. A variety of factors may influence away-from-home food purchases, but it is
plausible that this type of nutrition labeling on menus in restaurant establishments would be used
by consumers when a third of the population use nutrition information on packaged foods [39].
In response, the Obesity Working Group advised the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to
encourage restaurants to provide nutrition information to help consumers make healthy choices [40]
and following this, a population-based public health initiative targeting food prepared away from
home was implemented to help ameliorate the rising rates of overweight and obesity. Section 4205 of
the Patient Protection and Affordability Care Act passed in 2010 required that chain restaurants and
similar retail food establishments with 20 or more sites post calorie information for menu items at
the point-of-purchase [41] to help consumers make healthy choices when eating food prepared away
from home.
Such far-reaching policy has the potential to effect overall U.S. away-from-home dietary intake.
Several previous systematic reviews and meta-analyses have been completed to evaluate the impact
of menu labeling on calories chosen in an away-from-home setting [42–46] but evaluation regarding
nutrient intakes, specifically carbohydrates, total fat, saturated fat, and sodium, has not been included.
Estimation of the purchase or intake of these nutrients in the overall U.S. dietary context of excessive
calorie intake, not including other populations [43,46], and the special designation of saturated fat and
sodium intake as nutrients of concern, is critical to determine how menu labeling may be influencing
not only the quantity of U.S. caloric energy but also indicators in order to begin to quantify the quality
of energy from foods consumed away from home. Adults primarily make away-from-home purchasing
decisions, thus the previous systematic reviews of Long et al. [42], Swartz et al. [44], and Sinclair et
al. [43] including non-adults, do not provide clear information on adult populations. Finally, evaluation
of purchase intentions only [45], may not reflect actual ordering/consumption behavior among U.S.
adults. Therefore, the novel hypothesis of this study was that restaurant menu labeling would not affect
caloric choice or intake but would alter carbohydrate, total fat, saturated fat, and sodium choice or
intake compared with before menu labeling or compared with a control group, in an away-from-home
setting in the U.S. adult population. The hypothesis is based on the previous literature showing null or
minimal differences in calorie choice and attempts to fill the gap of knowledge indicating whether
menu labeling may impact chosen or consumed nutrients. Secondly, the effect of menu labeling in a
natural away-from-home setting or in a lab environment was hypothesized to make a difference in the
 Nutrients 2017, 9, 1088

efficacy of menu labeling as an intervention to alter caloric choice or intake among U.S. adults. Data
were handled to prevent the interference of interventions other than quantitative nutritional labeling
(education, taxation, etc.) and a special emphasis on high quality study designs was implemented in
order to inform future implementation of this policy intended to support the prevention and reduction
of obesity and other chronic diseases.
2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Study Identification and Selection
This meta-analysis was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic
Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) [47] using the protocol developed by Crockett et al. [48] (with
modifications) and the Cochrane guidance [49]. Included articles were published in the English
language and among U.S. adults (>18 years old) from 1950 to 2014. Studies including a minority of
individuals 15 to 18 years old [50,51] were retained to maintain sample size and power in the analysis,
however, the effect of their inclusion was evaluated by completing the meta-analyses with and without
these participants. Types of interventions included comparisons of nutrition labeling strategies at the
point-of-selection in full-service restaurants, fast-food restaurants, or simulated settings. Only studies
evaluating the implementation of quantitative calorie information for all or most menu items at point
of purchase were included. Studies with multiple interventions (education; taxation; distinct labeling
format: traffic light, healthy symbol, exercise equivalents, etc.) were included if the independent
effect of quantitative nutrition labeling could be assessed. Besides calories and nutrient values, the
succinct statement “2000 calories a day is used for general nutrition advice, but calorie needs vary”
was not considered an educational component, but a regular labeling component according to the
FDA requirement for this statement on menu labels. Groups within studies that included education,
taxation, or/and a labeling format other than quantitative calorie/nutrient labeling were excluded.
Outcome measures evaluated were estimates of energy, carbohydrates, total fat, saturated fat, and
sodium purchased or consumed. There were no exclusion criteria based on study participants’ gender,
body mass index, race, ethnicity, and social or economic status.
Study designs eligible for consideration and criteria for inclusion were developed based on The
Cochrane Consumers and Communication Review Group (CC&CRG) [49] supplementary guidance
for review authors on study design, study quality, and analysis (Table 1).
Quality of the studies was classified as “A” (Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT), quasi-RCT,
Controlled Before and After (CBA) studies, and Interrupted Time Series (ITS) when they adhered to all
criteria listed in Table 1) following the recommendation for inclusion in meta-analysis by CC&CRG
and were used in an initial meta-analysis. Since few reports were found under this classification,
a second meta-analysis was conducted broadening inclusion criteria to reports with study quality
classified as “B”. In this classification, cross-sectional studies following all criteria as well as RCT,
quasi-RCT, CBA/Before and After (BA) studies, and ITS following all but one of the criteria stated
in Table 1 were allowed for inclusion (BA without a control group following all other criteria were
also allowed for inclusion). Cross-sectional studies that did not meet one or more criteria and all other
study designs that did not fill two or more criteria were excluded from this meta-analysis. After study
design classification and selection, the Cochrane Collaboration’s tool for assessing risk of bias was
applied to further identify and exclude studies containing high risk of bias [52]. The rationale for these
stringent criteria was the intent to perform a meta-analysis including only strong study designs in
order to produce the highest quality evidence.
Various databases were searched from January 2015 to March 2015 including: PubMed; Cumulated
Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL); Trials Register of Promoting Health
Interventions (TRoPHI); The Cochrane Library; Food Science and Technology Abstracts; PsycINFO;

a Study designs were identified based on the Cochrane Consumers and Communication Review Group study
design guide [49]; b RCT designation was used only when allocation was clearly not decided by the clinician or the
participant, and that assignment to one group or another was not predictable; c Before and after studies without a
control group adhering to other criteria were also included in this group.
Two reviewers independently and sequentially assessed titles, abstracts, then papers identified in
the search according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria outlined in the protocol. After each stage of
assessment, the reviewers compared results and discussed any disagreements. If the disagreement

could not be resolved, a third party was consulted to reach a final decision regarding inclusion.
Data were collected using abstraction forms based upon the Cochrane Public Health Group data
extraction template [53]. Once data were collected, the last author reviewed and verified the extracted
information against that presented in the respective articles. All references and associated databases
were maintained in EndNote X5 (Clarivate Analytics, Philadelphia, PA, USA) and references and
corresponding results of assessment at each stage were maintained in Microsoft Excel (Microsoft,
Redmond, WA, USA).

Data collected during abstraction included study setting, sample size, participant characteristics, 
study design, data collection methods, type of intervention/point of purchase labeling information, 
presence of interventions other than nutritional labeling (nutrition education, taxation, etc.), labeling 
format (quantitative vs. qualitative), and measurement of calories and nutrients purchased or 
consumed. The scope of the current study was limited to food ordering and consumption behaviors 
in restaurants and similar settings on a population or individual level. Food orders were reported as 
the total calories ordered or the difference in calories ordered between the intervention and 
comparison groups. Food consumption was reported as the “amount of food consumed or calories 
consumed as part of a meal” [48]. Besides ordered/consumed calories (kcal), studies including data 
for total fat (g), total carbohydrate (g), saturated fat (g), and sodium (mg) ordered/consumed were

format (quantitative vs.

consumed. The scope of the current study was limited to food ordering and consumption behaviors in
restaurants and similar settings on a population or individual level. Food orders were reported as the
total calories ordered or the difference in calories ordered between the intervention and comparison
groups. Food consumption was reported as the “amount of food consumed or calories consumed as
part of a meal” [48]. Besides ordered/consumed calories (kcal), studies including data for total fat (g),
total carbohydrate (g), saturated fat (g), and sodium (mg) ordered/consumed were also evaluated
regarding the possible effects of labeling on the selection and consumption of these nutrients.
2.3. Statistics
Meta-analyses were performed in 2016 and applied the techniques found in Egger et al. [54] and
Hedges et al. [55]. Meta-analysis outcomes can be derived with a variety of parameters, including effect
sizes, confidence intervals, and standard deviations. For this particular meta-analysis, all parameters
were converted to means and standard deviations, as the majority of reviewed manuscripts used this
parameter in their results. If confidence intervals or standard errors were used in the articles, the
appropriate formulas were used to derive standard deviations. For studies with multiple locations,
pooled standard deviations were derived from the sites and means were averaged across sites in order
to determine the pre- and post-time point parameters.
Once means and standard deviations were derived for each contributing study, the change in
calories was calculated, along with the standard deviation of the difference. These in turn were used
to derive the variance of the difference, which was used to find the pooled standard deviation. Study
level weighted mean differences were calculated, and then used with the other outcomes to derive the
overall meta-analysis weighted mean difference. Confidence interval error terms for the final weighted
mean difference were calculated based on pooled standard deviation, total sample size, and the 97.5th
percentile of the z-table in order to find the 95% confidence interval of the meta-analysis’ weighted
mean difference. Q and I2 statistics were performed to test for heterogeneity [18] and data consistency.
A random effect model was used to pool estimates across studies. Tree charts were produced using SAS
v9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA) to visually show each study’s outcome and the overall meta-analysis
outcome. Similar analyses were performed after stratification of studies in settings types (laboratory
and non-laboratory or away-from-home settings) and for studies including each additional nutrient
evaluated (carbohydrates, total fat, saturated fat, and sodium).
3. Results
3.1. Selected Studies and Characteristics
Overall, 42,282 studies were identified via database searching (Figure 1). After eliminating
duplicates, 21,239 studies were included in the title reading stage and 436 studies were retained for
abstract evaluation. Fifty-six full-text publications were included in the full-text review and 42 were
excluded [36,56–96]. Five studies [51,97–100] classified as “A” and nine [50,101–108] studies classified
as “B” containing consumed and/or ordered calories as an outcome were included in the meta-analysis,
collectively representing 0.07% of the total titles (without duplicates) identified (Figure 1). The
sum of participants in all fourteen selected studies (“A” and “B”) was 552,029. Regarding study
design, Roberto et al. [99] was a RCT; Temple et al. (2011) [108], Temple et al. (2010) [100], and
Harnack et al. [51] were quasi-RCTs; Nelson et al. [104] was an ITS study; Elbel et al. [97], Finkelstein
et al. [98], Krieger et al. [103], Pulos and Leng [106], Tandon et al. [107], Platkin et al. [105],
and Downs et al. [102] were CBA or BA; and Auchincloss et al. [101] and Brissette et al. [50]
were cross-sectional studies.
Before-intervention means and standard deviations from studies
with BA and ITS designs were included with the control means and standard deviations from
the other study designs. Nine articles reported menu label implementation in away-from-home
settings [50,97,98,101–104,106,107] and five involved laboratory settings [51,99,100,105,108] (Table 2).

the effect of menu labeling on both calories ordered and consumed, but only mean ordered calories
were used in this meta-analysis (Table 2) in order to maintain the most consistency with the other
studies and avoid duplication. Results supported the analysis of no difference among calories chosen
or consumed. Meta-analysis restricted to articles classified as “A” resulted in no statistically significant
association (−0.13 calories; 95% CI: −0.83, 0.56). Moreover, results of the meta-analysis of all fourteen
articles (“A” plus “B”) also indicated no statistically significant association between calorie labeling
and lower caloric orders/consumption (p < 0.05), with an overall mean difference (95% CI) of −0.21
calories (95% CI: −1.36, 0.94) between pre- and post-treatment periods (Figure 2). Despite a focus on
adults, Harnack et al. [51] and Brissette et al. [50] also included some individuals under 18 years old.

The studies by Temple et al. (2011) [108] and Temple et al. (2010) [100] reported calories 
consumed only, while Nelson et al. [104], Elbel et al. [97], Finkelstein et al. [98], Krieger et al. [103], 
Pulos and Leng [106], Tandon et al. [107], Platkin et al. [105], Downs et al. [102], Auchincloss et al. 
[101], and Brissette et al. [50] reported calories ordered only. Roberto et al. [99] and Harnack et al. [51] 
looked at the effect of menu labeling on both calories ordered and consumed, but only mean ordered

outcome (−0.19 calories; 95% CI: −1.25, 0.87). 
Notably, the Forest plot indicates that most of the studies with an association between calorie 
labeling and lower caloric orders/consumption were conducted in laboratory settings (Figure 2).

Thus, a meta-analysis including only the studies conducted in laboratory settings was performed.
A significant decrease in the post-period with a mean of −115.2 calories from pre-period (95% CI:
−99.50, −130.87) was found. No significant difference was observed between pre- and post-period
in natural, away-from-home settings only (0.03 calories; 95% CI: −0.96, 0.89). The results supported
the hypothesis that the setting makes a difference to the efficacy of menu labeling in altering caloric
choice or intake. High heterogeneity in the study designs and sample populations justified a need to
adjust for these differences using random effects models. Yet, even after random effects modeling,
the heterogeneity measures, Q and I2 statistics, remained significant (p < 0.05) in all meta-analyses
conducted, indicating inherent heterogeneity in the studies and populations and/or outcomes that
could not be controlled for.
3.3. Impact of Menu Labeling on Carbohydrates, Fat, Saturated Fat, and Sodium Ordered or Consumed
Among the fourteen included studies in this meta-analysis, three also reported total ordered
carbohydrate [51,101,106], fat [51,104,106], and saturated fat [51,97,101] and four reported ordered
sodium [97,101,104,106] (Table 2). Harnack et al. [51] and Elbel et al. [97] used menu labels containing
only calorie information; carbohydrate, saturated fat, and total fat content of foods chosen or consumed
in Harnack et al. and saturated fat, sodium, and sugar for Elbel et al. were exclusively used for analysis
purposes. Menu labeling in Auchincloss et al. [101], Nelson et al. [104], and Pulos and Leng [106]
included the respective nutrients that were also analyzed as outcomes in Table 3. The meta-analysis of
mean differences did not support an association between labeling and ordered carbohydrate (p < 0.05)
(−0.1 g; 95% CI: −0.6, 0.5), fat (<0.1 g; 95% CI: −0.0, 0.0), saturated fat (<0.01 g 95% CI: −0.1; 0.1), and
sodium (−0.6 mg; 95% CI: −3.7, 2.5) (Table 3), nor the hypothesis that intake of these nutrients would
be altered as a result of menu labeling.

4. Discussion
The results of this meta-analysis showed no effect of menu labeling on calories chosen, either
ordered or consumed, among U.S. adults in natural settings, thus supporting the hypothesis and
previous findings. A significant difference of −115.2 calories was found when meta-analysis was
restricted to studies conducted in laboratory settings. This is a minimal calorie value in the context
of a daily and usual dietary intake but demonstrates how the setting may influence efficacy of this
intervention. Novel meta-analysis of carbohydrates, total fat, saturated fat, and sodium resulted in
no significant effect of menu labeling on choosing or consuming these nutrients in food away from
home among U.S. adults. Menu labeling was expected to result in alterations in choice or intake of
these nutrients on the basis of efficacy to improve dietary choice or intake that had previously been
undetected in meta-analyses results of null or minimal changes to caloric choice and intake. The lack
of significant nutrient changes, however, are tempered with acknowledgement of the few studies
included in those analysis.
A laboratory setting is not the setting that menu labeling is intended for as a real-life
intervention. The controlled and manipulated laboratory setting may likely influence the behavior of
participants [51]. For example, hunger may be differentially related to eating behavior in laboratory
and real-life settings and this could lead to differences in caloric ordering/consumption patterns.
Three of the five lab-based studies in this meta-analysis [99,100,108] quantified and controlled for
hunger in the analysis, but none of the real-life setting studies measured this quality. Thus, knowledge
of how this factor may have influenced results among the diverse settings is not known, and thus
future research is needed. Other variables that may influence an individual’s choice in an external
environment may be not easily translated into a laboratory setting. Along with the nature and extent
to which one’s actions are scrutinized by others, the particular context and process by which a decision
is embedded, and the self-selection of the individuals making the decisions, may be very different and
influential in food and beverages ordered or consumed in real world vs. laboratory settings [109].
Previous studies indicate that taste [110,111],
cost [110,111],
accessibility [111],
and
convenience [111] are factors of higher relevance to patrons than nutritional concerns [110]. These
variants may not be observed in laboratory experiments where food options are often limited, the
food is offered for free, and the influence of accessibility and convenience cannot be evaluated. Mohr
et al. [112] also identified a relative indifference to health consequences of behavior as one of the
predictors of more frequent consumption of fast foods [112]. However, the sample of participants who
agree to participate in laboratory setting studies may not represent a group with a similar attitude
and set of beliefs regarding health in such a setting. Thus, factors not related to nutritional labeling
alone are likely to be influencing the decision of food ordering/consumption in natural settings
compared with laboratory settings, limiting the usefulness of laboratory controlled study findings
to real-world applications. The challenge of evaluating the impact of nutrition labeling to food
ordering/consumption in natural setting studies may be inherent to the limited ability of investigators
to identify and quantify the variant and perhaps multiple factors that control a particular behavior.
Previous meta-analyses and systematic reviews showed similar results of little to no difference in
calories purchased/consumed due to menu labeling. Long el al. [42] found that labeling was associated
with a –18.13 ordered kilocalorie reduction per meal, however, when only studies with control groups
in restaurant settings were included, no significant association was found. Similarly, Swartz et al. [44]
and Sinclair at al. [43] found no correlation between purchased/consumed calories and menu labeling.
Notably, previous meta-analyses included studies with online ordering, non-restaurant/restaurant-like
setting (i.e., coffee-shops) and hypothetical ordering [42], diverse age groups [42–44], and studies
conducted in countries other than the U.S. [43].
These kinds of studies were excluded in our
meta-analysis. We also included only studies adherent to stringent criteria based on CC&CRG guidance
and classified as “A” and “B” (Table 1) that included quantitative calorie/nutrient labeling. Despite
these restrictions, high heterogeneity was still present. The high heterogeneity may be due to the
diversity of study designs (RCTs, quasi-RTCs, BA studies, ITS studies, and cross-sectional studies),
 Nutrients 2017, 9, 1088
12 of 18
varying dining settings (fast-food restaurants, laboratory settings, and full-service restaurants), and
different outcome measures (calories ordered or consumed). This diversity highlights a need for
more studies in real-world settings that use standardized, criteria-specified, and bound study designs
and methodologies.
Despite the finding of no effect of menu labeling on calories ordered/consumed in natural settings,
menu labeling may have other impacts. Some evidence suggests that companies may be reformulating
products (including decreasing calories content) in response to menu labeling regulations [113]. Pulos
and Leng [106] reported that after seeing the results of their menu analyses, some locally owned
restaurants modified portion sizes or ingredients. Some of the studies included in this meta-analysis
also indicated that not all consumers or participants were aware of calorie labels [103,106]. Moreover,
the way that calorie information was presented was not homogeneous, clearly reported, nor described
at all in some of the included studies. Among studies providing clear and full description, calorie
information was placed on the menu next to food item descriptions and price in three studies [51,99,101]
and given as a separate pamphlet with the restaurant menu in Nelson et al. [104]. The optimal method
for delivering nutrition information to the consumer (i.e., font-size, color, location, etc.) is yet to be
determined. Educational materials to increase awareness and explain labeling use may inform food
choice and enhance labeling use [51]. Previous nutrition knowledge was not assessed in most of the
included studies, with the exception of the study by Brissette et al. [50], which found that knowledge of
the calorie Recommended Dietary Allowance was not associated with the amount of purchased calories,
yet the effect of nutrition knowledge on eating behavior may manifest in other ways and is another
area for future hypotheses. Other factors, as mentioned above, may also influence calories ordered
and/or consumed, such as consumer preference for taste, convenience, or price. For example, taxation
decreased the purchasing of more calorically dense foods in obese, but not non-obese participants in
Temple et al. (2011) [108], results that were not included in this meta-analysis, indicating that specific
participant characteristics may differentially be influenced by such manipulations. Indirect impacts
of menu labeling may also result; for example, menu labeling policies may lead to a shift in broader
social norms to adopt healthier diets over time. Thus, menu labeling may have a potential to change
dietary behavior beyond the results of this meta-analysis and other previous studies.
Consideration of dietary intake beyond calories, such as the inclusion of nutrient-dense
foods and beverages—vegetables, fruits, whole grains, fat-free or low-fat milk and milk products,
seafood, lean meats and poultry, eggs, beans and peas, and nuts and seeds and limiting simple
carbohydrates, fat, saturated fat, and sodium is critical to understanding the efficacy of menu labeling
to support dietary changes that prevent diet-related chronic diseases like diabetes, dyslipidemia, and
hypertension. [114–117]. Evaluation of nutrients provides evidence of potential changes in the type
or quality of nutrients ordered/consumed and not only the quantity of nutrients ordered/consumed
due to menu labeling changes. In our meta-analysis, significant differences in the calories ordered or
consumed for carbohydrates, fat, saturated fat, and sodium were not observed after menu labeling
implementation. Analysis of nutrients purchased or consumed in menu labeling interventions is of
growing interest, but still few studies have included evaluation of the impact of menu labeling on
the ordering/consumption behavior of nutrients. Thus, despite our results, future studies should
continue to include evaluation of menu labeling on nutrients ordered/consumed to provide more
robust insights into these broader aspects of menu labeling outcomes. Future studies should consider
evaluating additional nutrients or dietary components such as added sugars, dietary fiber, calcium,
vitamin D, potassium, and overall indicators of dietary quality such as the Healthy Eating Index in
order to provide a more complete picture of dietary intake.
This meta-analysis included only studies adherent to stringent criteria, based on CC&CRG
guidance and classified as “A” and “B” study designs, and to our knowledge is the first to evaluate the
effect of menu labeling on calories and carbohydrates, fat, saturated fat, and sodium ordering/intake.
Because few articles were found to contain evaluation of those nutrients, these results highlight
the need of nutrient evaluation in future studies to draw more robust conclusions. Investigation
 Nutrients 2017, 9, 1088

of menu labeling effects separately for laboratory and natural settings allowed results specific to
real-life environments.
Although only stringent criteria were used to grade study designs for inclusion, the diversity in
study methodologies resulted in high heterogeneity. This meta-analysis did not assess what effect
the posting of daily calories/nutrient requirements in addition to menu labeling had on calories and
nutrients consumed and ordered. Consumer knowledge of nutrition daily requirements may affect the
choice of food consumed away from home and how these choices are balanced with other food intake
throughout the day. U.S. adults were included in this analysis, but specific populations, such as obese
individuals or children, may react to menu-labeling differently. Finally, there exists the possibility that
other unpublished studies were not included in this meta-analysis.
5. Conclusions
Menu labeling had no effect on calories, carbohydrates, fat (total and saturated), and sodium
ordered and consumed away from home among U.S. adults in natural settings. This meta-analysis, to
our knowledge, was the first to include nutrients ordered/consumed along with calories in response
to restaurant menu labeling. As menu labeling is implemented across the U.S., further examination of
the long-term impacts on the full spectrum of dietary intake will inform the use of this policy intended
to support the prevention and reduction of obesity and other chronic diseases.
