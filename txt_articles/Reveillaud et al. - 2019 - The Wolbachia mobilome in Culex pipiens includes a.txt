Wolbachia is a genus of obligate intracellular bacteria found in nematodes and arthropods
worldwide, including insect vectors that transmit dengue, West Nile, and Zika viruses.
Wolbachia’s unique ability to alter host reproductive behavior through its temperate
bacteriophage WO has enabled the development of new vector control strategies. However,
our understanding of Wolbachia’s mobilome beyond its bacteriophages is incomplete. Here,
we reconstruct near-complete Wolbachia genomes from individual ovary metagenomes of
four wild Culex pipiens mosquitoes captured in France. In addition to viral genes missing
from the Wolbachia reference genome, we identify a putative plasmid (pWCP), consisting
of a 9.23-kbp circular element with 14 genes. We validate its presence in additional Culex
pipiens mosquitoes using PCR, long-read sequencing, and screening of existing metagenomes.
The discovery of this previously unrecognized extrachromosomal element opens additional
possibilities for genetic manipulation of Wolbachia.

osquitoes are major vectors of disease-causing patho-
gens worldwide including viruses such as dengue, West
Nile, Chikungunya, Zika, and yellow fever1–3. In the
absence of effective vaccines and the off-target effects of insecti-
cides used to control mosquitoes, novel vector biocontrol efforts
are the focus of intense study4. Over the past decade, the widely
distributed endosymbiotic alphaproteobacteria Wolbachia has
gained attention as a promising mosquito-control strategy. The
basic reasons for its heightened attention is that Wolbachia
can cause reproductive parasitism whereby the intracellular
bacteria in the reproductive tissues can alter sexual reproduction
to enhance its maternal spread through host populations at the
expense of host fitness5–7. Second and notably, native Wolbachia
reduce RNA virus replication in the fruit fly Drosophila8–10, and
Wolbachia transinfections into mosquito species (i.e., Aedes
aegypti, Ae. albopictus, Ae. polynesienses, and Anopheles stephensi)
similarly result in mosquito lines refractory to various types
of pathogenic RNA viruses11–14. The combination of a selfish
drive system and pathogen blocking by Wolbachia has led to
successful pilot trials for suppression of mosquito population
size and replacement of infected mosquito populations so they
can no longer transmit pathogens15–17.
Wolbachia are transovarially transmitted from the mother to
offspring6,18–20. In some arthropods, including the naturally
infected vector species complex Culex pipiens, Wolbachia ‘modify’
sperm in testes, leading to embryonic lethality if the infected male
mates with either an uninfected female or a female harbouring an
incompatible Wolbachia strain. When both male and female are
infected with the same Wolbachia, the modification is ‘rescued’,
and compatibility is restored21. This reproductive alteration,
termed ‘cytoplasmic incompatibility’ (CI), comprises the most
common form of Wolbachia-induced parasitism and, as studied
in C. pipiens, can lead to highly diverse unidirectional and
bidirectional incompatibility phenotypes22. CI is currently used in
vector control studies for population replacement by Wolbachia-
infected strains that block arbovirus transmission17 or population
suppression that reduces the number of mosquito vectors23.
Notably, the genes responsible for CI24–26 occur in the eukaryotic
association module of Wolbachia’s temperate phage WO25–27,
which laterally transfers between Wolbachia coinfections and
evolves rapidly28–32. Overall, these findings emphasize the
importance of further investigating mobile genetic elements
in Wolbachia.
While recent studies shed light on the role of phage WO in
Wolbachia genome evolution and CI, other extrachromosomal
elements, such as plasmids, have not been detected in the sym-
biont. Notably, over half of the species in the closely related
Rickettsia genus have plasmids33 that play roles in DNA repli-
cation, partitioning, mobilization, and conjugation34,35 and offer
a potential tool for genetic manipulation of diverse members of
Rickettsia36,37. Similar genetic manipulation strategies for Wol-
bachia are conceivable27; however, previous efforts to search for
such extrachromosomal mobile genetic elements have not been
successful38,39. The lack of isolates limit direct insights into
Wolbachia genomics, and most metagenomic approaches thus far
rely on pooled individuals grown in the laboratory environment
due to low infection densities40,41. Since these limitations can
conceal naturally occurring genomic diversity among Wolbachia
populations, highly resolved analyses of individual mosquitoes
may reveal additional insights into the Wolbachia ‘mobilome’, the
pool of all mobile genetic elements associated with Wolbachia
populations.
Here we sequence ovary samples from four wild-caught C.
pipiens individuals captured in Southern France from a single
trap. Using genome-resolved metagenomic and pangenomic
analysis strategies, we were able to reconstruct and compare near-
complete Wolbachia genomes from each individual. Besides a
diverse set of virus-associated genes that were missing or absent
in the reference Wolbachia genome wPip Pel, our data reveal the
first lines of evidence for an extrachromosomal circular element
with genetic and functional hallmarks of a plasmid that we ten-
tatively name pWCP.
Results
A
Wolbachia
metagenome-assembled
genome
(MAG)
is
recovered in each sample. Shotgun sequencing of DNA recov-
ered from ovary samples of four C. pipiens individuals (O03, O07,
O11, O12) resulted in 65–78 million paired-end sequences after
quality filtering. Metagenomic assembly of each sample indivi-
dually yielded 147K–183K contiguous DNA segments (contigs)
>1 kbp, which recruited 48.1–72.9% of the raw sequencing reads.
The relatively high fraction of unmapped reads were likely due to
challenges
associated
with
the
assembly
of
environmental
metagenomes42,43, especially in the presence of eukaryotic host
genomic DNA. Supplementary Table 1 reports statistics for the
raw number of reads and assembly results for each sample. We
employed a metagenomic binning strategy that uses sequence
composition signatures and differential coverage statistics of
contigs across samples. For each ovary sample, we were able to
reconstruct a highly complete single bacterial MAG that resolved
to Wolbachia (Table 1).
Wolbachia MAGs include highly covered non-phage contigs.
The
relatively
low
number
of
single-nucleotide
variants
(0.01–0.05%, Supplementary Table 2) suggested that each Wol-
bachia MAG represented a nearly monoclonal population of
bacterial cells in the ovary metagenomes. In addition, the high
average nucleotide identity across our MAGs and the 1482 kbp
reference genome for Wolbachia, wPip Pel40 (99.1–99.98%,
Supplementary Table 3) suggested a high degree of conservation
between the endosymbionts of different individuals. Our meta-
genomic read recruitment analyses using Wolbachia MAGs
revealed consistent coverage statistics averaging 168×–491×
for contigs that were enriched with bacterial genes. However,
a subset of contigs in each individual displayed approximately a
five-fold increase in coverage (Supplementary Table 4). Because
Wolbachia harbour prophage WO that can enter the lytic cycle

 and form phage particles27,44,45, we postulated that some of the
contigs could be phage associated, which would explain coverage
inconsistencies. We used the five prophage regions identified in
the wPip Pel reference genome27,40 to identify contigs enriched
with genes of phage origin. Contigs classified and validated
through homology searches against phage WO matched to
contigs that were highly covered in our MAGs, confirming that
most shifts in coverage could be attributed to phages of
Wolbachia. However, surprisingly, five contigs in our MAGs
(Contig O12_A, Contig O11_A, Contig O07_A, Contig O07_A’,
and Contig O03_A, Supplementary Data 1) showed no homol-
ogy to prophage WO despite their remarkable coverage that
ranged between 720× and 2176×. Interestingly, the 5’ and 3’ ends
of these contigs showed homology to the non-coding flanking
regions of wPip’s ISWpi12 transposable element (TE; WP0440,
WP1209, and WP1347) of the IS110-family46. Given their
(1) high coverage in metagenomes, (2) lack of homology to
prophage WO, and (3) putative association with IS110 TE, we
hypothesized
that
these
contigs
could
represent
extra-
chromosomal elements.
pWCP: a Wolbachia-associated putative plasmid. Based on
homology between the ends of these five contigs and the flanking
regions of IS110 TE, we predicted that the missing region was
the latter element. We artificially circularized Contig O11_A
(8037 bp) and inserted an IS110 TE (1386 bp) based on the
overlapping 5’ and 3’ ends (Fig. 1). Metagenomic read recruit-
ment onto this artificially circularized contig, which we tentatively
name ‘pWCP’ (for plasmid of Wolbachia endosymbiont in
C. pipiens), showed consistent coverage over its entire length
except a clear two-fold coverage increase in a region that matched
to the IS110 TE in all four C. pipiens individuals in our study
(Supplementary Figure 1). These data suggested the IS110 TE
are located in the extrachromosomal pWCP while some others
could be integrated in the bacterial chromosome. The read
recruitment from three C. pipiens egg metagenomes generated
in a previous study32 confirmed the near identical presence of
pWCP in all three, including the increase in coverage matching
to the IS110 TE (Supplementary Figure 1).
To validate the circular and extrachromosomal nature of
pWCP independently of short-read recruitment- and assembly-
based strategies, we generated long reads from additional
C. pipiens complex samples using a MinION sequencer. Since
MinION sequencing occurs with no polymerase chain reaction
(PCR) or downstream assembly steps, we hypothesized that long
reads that match to pWCP should never be (1) flanked by
genomic regions matching to the Wolbachia chromosome and
(2) longer than the pWCP itself. Our MinION sequencing
analysis resulted in 14,808 high-quality sequences that were
>5000 nucleotides. While a significant fraction of these reads
were eukaryotic contamination and the lambda phage DNA that
we used to pad our low-biomass samples (see Methods), a local
BLAST search of artificially circularized pWCP sequence against
long reads revealed 19 that aligned to pWCP with an e value of
<1e−20 (Supplementary Data 2). Thirteen of these 19 reads
covered >50% of the length of pWCP and contained no other
genomic region. In other words, each of the long reads were equal
to or shorter than the length of pWCP, as expected for an
extrachromosomal element (Fig. 2a). Moreover, 6 of these 13
reads were exactly equal to the length of pWCP, covering its
entirety
with
non-identical
start
positions,
confirming
its
circularity (Fig. 2a). The final 6 long reads that covered <50%
of the length of pWCP had specific matches to the IS110 TE
(Fig. 2b); this result is consistent with the multiple occurrences
of the IS110 TE in the Wolbachia genome and explains the
increase in coverage in metagenomic read recruitment results
(Supplementary Figure 1).
To further validate the extrachromosomal nature of pWCP, we
PCR screened genomic DNA from the wild caught individuals as
well as from tetracycline (TC)-treated laboratory lines (TC1–TC3;
negative controls). TC treatment eliminates Wolbachia from its
hosts and is commonly used to generate C. pipiens uninfected
laboratory lines47. First, using LCO1490 and HCO2198 mito-
chondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) invertebrate
primers48, we detected the presence of a ~708-bp band in the four
C. pipiens individuals and the three Wolbachia-free Culex
quinquefasciatus controls treated with TC (TC1–TC3), confirm-
ing the presence of arthropod DNA in all samples (Fig. 1b). Next,
we verified the presence of Wolbachia DNA in the first four
samples by PCR amplifying a 438-bp fragment of the Wolbachia
16S rRNA gene using Wspec-F and Wspec-R primers49. No band
was observed in the TC samples, confirming the absence of
Wolbachia (Fig. 1c). Critically, a ~1800-bp fragment amplified
with primers 263F and 2127R (Supplementary Table 5) designed
from the ends of the artificially circularized contig within DnaB
gene (and uniquely matching those sites), confirmed the circular
nature of the pWCP and its presence only in Wolbachia-infected
C. pipiens samples (Fig. 1d). We also designed primers to Sanger
sequence across the circular gap (see Supplementary Table 5 for
primer sets EC_1–EC_7), and results confirmed the pWCP
sequence obtained with both Illumina and MinION sequencing.
Finally, we amplified IS110 TE with primers EC_4F and EC_4R
(Supplementary Table 5) in the four C. pipiens samples studied
herein while observing no band in the Wolbachia-free samples
(Fig. 1e) in order to verify the strict association of IS110 TE with
Wolbachia (Fig. 1f). These results were further confirmed using
additional rifampicin- and oxytetracycline-treated C. pipiens
samples (Supplementary Figure 2). Of note, we verified the
presence of pWCP in the originating TC1–TC3 and C. pipiens
laboratory stocks prior to antibiotic treatment.
The average nucleotide identity of the four independently
assembled pWCP sequences from individual mosquitoes was
99.65–100% (Supplementary Table 6). In addition, we identified a
8315-bp contig in the wPip JHB assembly (ABZA01000008.150),
which also was >99.53% identical to each of the four pWCP
sequences (Supplementary Table 6). The IS110 TE was 100%
identical across samples and confirmed as clonal. Our additional
read recruitment analyses from publicly available metagenomes
(SRR5810516, SRR5810517, SRR5810518)32 also revealed the
widespread occurrence of pWCP in C. pipiens individuals from
Turkey, Algeria, and Tunisia (Supplementary Note 1, Supple-
mentary Figure 3) at a similar 4.2–7.3-fold higher copy number
relative to the Wolbachia genome. We also confirmed that pWCP
and the Wolbachia genome display a similar tetranucleotide
composition (Supplementary Note 2, Supplementary Figure 4).
Overall, these findings suggest that pWCP is maintained over the
long term with Wolbachia from these strains.
pWCP encodes an IS110 TE, 14 genes, and an intergenic repeat
region. The IS element is homologous to ISWpi12 of the IS110
family46 based on IS finder platform search. Annotation of genes
in pWCP also revealed the presence of a disrupted DnaB-like
helicase, two RelBE loci, a ParA-like gene (each with identical AA
sequences across samples, Supplementary Note 3), and multiple
genes encoding hypothetical proteins (Fig. 1f, Supplementary
Data 3). The ParA-like partitioning sequence showed amino acid
homology to the chromosome partitioning of plasmid protein
(ParA) identified in Ca. Caedibacter acanthamoebae (an endo-
symbiont of acanthamoebae; e value: 2 × 10–46), the bacterium
Odyssella thessalonicensis (e value: 9 × 10–45), and Rickettsia

 raoultii (e value: 7 × 10–41). The RelBE toxin–antitoxin (TA) locus
has been identified in multiple Wolbachia genomes51 and is often
associated with prophage WO regions (e.g., of wVitA, wHa,
wMel, wAu, wRi, wSuzi, wFol, wInc), specifically within the tail
and/or capsid modules. In other bacteria, this TA system can
promote the stability of its encoding mobile element, including
plasmids or pathogenicity islands, through post-segregational
killing of cells that have lost the antitoxin component of the TA
operon52,53. Most remaining pWCP genes were hypothetical and
unique to either wPip and/or the B-Wolbachia phyletic super-
group54 (Supplementary Data 3), including GP-09 and GP-11
which showed a very weak homology to a Transcription Factor
and a Terminase, respectively (e value > 0 in SCOPe, Pfam, and
Clusters of Orthologous Group (COG), highlighting the need
for further functional characterization of this newly discovered
mobile genetic element. In particular, terminase proteins bind
and package DNA into the capsids of phage particles55. These
data indicate that the extrachromosomal DNA could potentially
fall into three categories: a simple plasmid, a mini-chromosome
of Wolbachia, or a plasmid-like replicon that hijacks the capsids
of phage WO.
Beyond the putative coding regions, alignment of all contigs
revealed an intergenic variable number tandem repeat (VNTR)
region (Fig. 3a, b, Supplementary Figure 5), characterized as 16-nt

 repeats adjacent to parA that vary in number among individual
pWCP sequences. Recent studies observed the same repeat
region, identified as pp-hC1A_5, and used it to genotype different
strains of Wolbachia56,57, yet these have not been studied at an
individual level. The authors suggested that a deletion in the
intergenic polymorphic region could serve as a recombination or
horizontal gene transfer site56. Alternatively, we hypothesize that
the direct repeats, as present in iteron plasmids, could indicate a
potential origin of replication and play a role in copy number
control58. Our analysis of the pWCP sequence also revealed a

 209-bp extragenic palindrome (EP) region with two palindromes
(Fig. 3c). Although the role of these sequences is not clear, the
closely related plasmid of Rickettsia monacensis (pRM) harbours
four perfect and four imperfect palindromes34.
The Wolbachia metapangenome reveals novel viral genes. The
assembly and binning of individual mosquitoes from the wild also
enabled comparison of the diversity and the gene content of
prophage WO regions in our Wolbachia genomes vs. the wPip Pel
reference genome. We performed a metapangenomic analysis
of the four Wolbachia MAGs and wPip Pel in conjunction with
the four metagenomes from individual mosquitoes. By linking
genes to their abundances in C. pipiens metagenomes, we aimed
at tying genomic and environmental data. To determine gene
coverages, we used the Wolbachia MAG O07 as reference for read
recruitment since (1) it was the largest MAG in size with most
number of genes (Table 1) and (2) all MAGs were over 99.8%
identitical (Supplementary Table 3).
The Wolbachia pangenome contained 1166 gene clusters (that
is, groups of homologous predicted open reading frames (ORFs)
based on amino acid sequence identity), the majority of which
were conserved across all five genomes (Fig. 4, Supplementary
Figure 6). wPip Pel and Wolbachia MAG O07 carried the largest
number of unique gene clusters (Supplementary Data 4). Genes
that were unique to wPip Pel (n = 41) encoded functions
including several transposases, bacteriophage capsid protein
coding genes, and other phage-related sequences, most of which
were associated with known Wolbachia prophages.
Gene clusters unique to MAG O07 (n = 56) included a gene
coding for an ankyrin and tetratricopeptide repeat protein
previously identified in phage WO from Nasonia vitripennis
wasps27. Ankyrin and tetratricopeptide repeats mediate a broad
range of protein–protein interactions (apoptosis, cell signaling,
inflammatory response, etc.) within eukaryotic cells and are
commonly associated with effector proteins of certain intracel-
lular pathogens59,60. There was also a Retron-type reverse
transcriptase and genes coding for Transposases (COG3293 and
a Transposase InsO and inactivated derivatives gene). Although
most remaining unique O07 gene clusters had no functional
annotation, about a third matched to eukaryotic viral genes based
on homology searches in the NCBI’s non-redundant protein
sequence database (Supplementary Data 5).
These data add to previous studies showing that regions of
genomic diversity between closely related Wolbachia genomes
are often virus associated50,61–63. Note that most gene clusters
with genes that were unique to MAG O07 did recruit reads from
the three other metagenomes (Fig. 4, Supplementary Figure 6),
suggesting that, even though they were not characterized in our
other MAGs, they did occur in C. pipiens metagenomes. Absence
of these genes from our MAGs are most likely due to (1) assembly
artifacts that result in fragmented contigs that are too short to be
considered for binning or (2) mutations in the gene context that
affect the gene caller to identify them properly. Gene clusters that
matched to pWCP also occurred only in our Wolbachia MAGs and
were missing in wPip Pel (Supplementary Figure 6), which is
expected since the wPip Pel reference genome is solely composed
of the Wolbachia bacterial chromosome40. Overall, the metapan-
genome sheds light on a substantial amount of viral genetic
diversity, revealing almost as many virus-associated genes as the
ones that were previously recognized in the reference genome wPip.
Unlike our Wolbachia MAGs, wPip Pel is a high-quality
genome assembled into a single scaffold. Even though wPip Pel is
not completely closed40, it offers a more complete representation
of the synteny of genes in comparison to our MAGs. Hence, in
addition to ordering gene clusters based on their distribution
patterns across all genomes (Supplementary Figure 6), we took
advantage of the wPip Pel genome to determine the order of gene
clusters in the metapangenome based on the order of wPip genes
in the wPip Pel genome (Fig. 4). This ‘forced synteny’ allowed us
to investigate the diversity and abundance of phage genes in the
context of the five previously identified prophage WO regions in
wPip Pel (Fig. 4). Some gene clusters within prophage regions
appeared to be unique to wPip Pel and were not detected in our
metagenomes. It is possible that these genes were not recovered
from our MAGs due to small contig size (that is, contigs were too
short to be considered for binning). However, our MAGs often
carried upstream and downstream phage genes in these regions,
suggesting that while some phage genes were conserved across
all genomes, others differed significantly from their wPip Pel
counterparts (Fig. 4, Supplementary Data 4). It is possible that a
set of new phage-associated genes only found in MAGs (Fig. 4,
Supplementary Data 5) have functional homologues in wPip Pel.
Previous studies indeed show WO genes that have distinct
nucleotide sequences yet similar predicted functions30. However,
it is also possible that some genes detected only in our our MAGs
at the sequence level may also be encoding unique functions
compared to known phage genes; for instance, eukaryotic-like
homologues were recently shown as constituents of phage WO27.

revealed that a single prophage WO region could include both
high- and low-coverage phage genes (Fig. 4). The multi-copy
occurrence of pWCP could explain its increased coverage
(Supplementary Figure 1), and differential coverage regimes for
genes within a single prophage region could be explained by at
least two different models. First, increased coverage of some
prophage genes could be attributed to lytic activity: the prophage
genes displaying lower bacterial-like coverage are not part of the
virion, while those with higher coverage correspond to phage
genes that are replicated and packaged into phage capsids. This
lytic model is consistent with the observation of phage particles in
C. pipiens mosquitoes44,45, observed lytic activity of Wolbachia
phages in Nasonia testes, and the sequencing of WO genomes
from purified phage particles27. The partial replication and
packaging of prophage WO genes could result from either a ‘less
than headful’ mechanism of packaging, as described in model

 phages P1 and T464,65, or it could represent active vs. degenerate
prophage variants in the wPip Pel chromosome. Second, some
genes in prophage WO genomes could be copied throughout
the Wolbachia chromosome explaining the increase in coverage
due to their multi-copy occurrence. This model is supported
by the prophage duplication events observed in the wRi and wSuz
genomes61,66 as well as the presence of TEs within and/or
flanking prophage variants27,40 that could enable genomic
rearrangement and duplication. These models may not be
mutually exclusive, and the system could involve both duplication
of prophage genomes and the induction of phage particles.
Discussion
Shotgun metagenomes from individual C. pipiens ovary samples
allowed us to de novo reconstruct Wolbachia genomes from
single mosquitoes and compare these MAGs to each other as well
as to the reference wPip Pel genome through pangenomic stra-
tegies. Our data reveal an extensive diversity of previously
undetected Wolbachia phage WO and other viral genes and
notably the first indication that Wolbachia harbours a candidate
plasmid, shedding new light on the richness of the Wolbachia
mobilome. The definition of a plasmid varies; here we adhere to
the typical characterization of a plasmid as a small hereditary,
extrachromosomal, circular element.
Even though a Wolbachia plasmid has not been reported
before, we did find evidence of its occurrence in C. pipiens
metagenomes in previous studies. It is likely that the previous
efforts overlooked this element due to computational challenges
associated with the assembly of metagenomic short reads. Beyond
the IS110 TE that occurred both in the plasmid and Wolbachia
chromosome, pWCP contained a region of intergenic VNTR that
differed across individuals in our study. This suggests that the
co-assembly of pooled individuals may yield fragmented contigs.
The same VNTR sequences were found in C. pipiens from
Australia, Argentina, USA, Italy, Japan, Israel, and Greece56, and
we confirmed the presence of pWCP in C. pipiens samples from
countries of the Mediterranean basin32. The high similarity
of pWCP sequences across C. pipiens metagenomes in addition
to its global prevalence suggest evolutionary constraints and a
possible functional role in Wolbachia symbiosis. However, we
did not detect the plasmid in other Wolbachia strains through
screening available metagenomes from the fly Drosophila mela-
nogaster, the planthopper Laodelphax striatella, and Anopheles
gambiae mosquito.
Our work demonstrates that the combination of genome-
resolved metagenomics, long-read sequencing, and pangenomic
strategies provide an effective computational framework to
investigate the diversity and distribution of mobile genetic
elements in endosymbionts that are challenging to cultivate.
Furthermore, it shows the importance of studying distinct indi-
viduals from wild mosquito populations, in parallel with con-
trolled experiments in laboratory settings, to improve our
understanding of the Wolbachia mobilome. The fragmented
nature of Wolbachia MAGs in our study emphasizes the critical
need for harnessing the power of emerging long-read sequencing
technologies to characterize complex genomic variations of
Wolbachia and its mobilome at finer scales. Wolbachia has been
so far recalcitrant to`genetic modification, but the discovery of
pWCP and phage WO may create new avenues for effective
genome-editing strategies.
Methods
Sample collection. We collected mosquito specimens using a carbon dioxide
mosquito trap located in Languedoc, Herault, France in May 2017 (Camping
l’Europe de Vic La Gardiole, EID Méditerranée). Specimens were transported alive
to the laboratory immediately upon recovery. We anesthetized adult females for
4 min at −20 °C and proceeded to species-level identification. To remove potential
contaminants from the insect surface, we gently vortexed specimens for 1 min in
1 ml cold (4 °C) 96% ethanol. We then transferred them to a new 1.5 ml tube with
1 ml sterile cold (4 °C) phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) 1× solution and gently
vortexed them again for 10 s to avoid DNA precipitation with ethanol. Finally, we
transferred specimens onto a sterile microscope slide with sterile PBS 1× on top
of a cold plate and dissected two ovaries from four specimens using sterilized
tweezers. We preserved ovary samples at −80 °C until further processing.
C. pipiens complex controls. We obtained Wolbachia uninfected mosquitoes by
treating the host with antibiotics. For antibiotics treatment we either used TC,
which inhibits protein synthesis, or rifampicin, which interferes with nucleic acid
synthesis67. The TC-treated lines47 shown in Fig. 1 (C. quinquefasciatus SLAB-TC
lines, ISEM, France) were raised at least 1 year without TC in standard laboratory
conditions before beginning experiments. The rifampicin and oxytetracycline-
treated C. pipiens lines were kindly provided by Maria del Mar Fernandez de Marco
(Animals Plant Health Agency, UK).
Metagenomic library preparation and sequencing. We extracted total genomic
DNA from each ovary sample, hereafter referred to as O03, O07, O11, and O12,
using the MoBio PowerFecal DNA Isolation Kit (QIAGEN Inc., Germantown, MD,
USA). We used an E220 Covaris instrument (Covaris, Woburn, MA, USA) to
sonicate 3.8–5.7 ng of genomic DNA. We end-repaired and 3’-adenylated resulting
fragments and used the NEBNext Ultra II DNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina
(New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA) to add NEXTflex PCR-free barcode
adapters (Bioo Scientific, Austin, TX, USA). We purified ligation products by
Ampure XP (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA, USA) and PCR-amplified DNA frag-
ments (>200 bp; 2 PCR reactions, 14 cycles) using Illumina adapter-specific pri-
mers and NEBNext Ultra II Q5 Master Mix (NEB). After library profile analysis
using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA)
and quantitative PCR quantification using the KAPA Library Quantification Kit for
Illumina Libraries (KapaBiosystems, Wilmington, MA, USA), we sequenced the
library using a HiSeq4000 Illumina sequencer (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA)
at the Genoscope in Evry, France, generating 151 bp paired-end reads. To remove
the least reliable data, we filtered the raw sequencing results using cluster intensity
and chastity filter as described in ref. 68.
Metagenomic assembly and binning. We used illumina-utils v1.4.469 to quality-
filter raw paired-end reads with the program ‘iu-filter-quality-minoche’ with
default parameters, IDBA_UD v1.1.270 to assemble paired-end reads into contigs,
and Bowtie2 v2.2.971 for all read recruitment analyses. We processed our contigs
that are >1000 nts and read recruitment results with anvi’o v572 to recover MAGs
from C. pipiens metagenomes. Briefly, we used the program ‘anvi-gen-contigs-
database’ to generate anvi’o contigs databases for each four individual assemblies,
during which anvi’o calculates and stores tetranucleotide frequency values and
Prodigal v2.6.373 identifies ORFs in each contig. We ran default anvi’o HMM
profiles on resulting contigs databases using the program ‘anvi-run-hmms’ and
assigned functions to genes using the program ‘anvi-run-ncbi-cogs’, which searches
gene amino acid sequences against the December 2014 release of the COG data-
base74 using blastp v2.3.0+75. We profiled the short reads of our contigs recruited
from each four individual metagenomes onto the four assemblies using the pro-
gram ‘anvi-profile’, which generates anvi’o profile databases that store the coverage
and detection statistics of each contig within each sample independently. We then
merged resulting anvi’o profile databases for each sample using the program
‘anvi-merge’. For an initial coarse binning, we used the CONCOCT76 algorithm
through the program ‘anvi-cluster-with-concoct’ and confined the number of
clusters to five using the parameter ‘–num-clusters-requested 5’. We then used the
program ‘anvi-script-get-collection-info’ to identify bins with a bacterial popula-
tion genome, manually refined them to identify bacterial genomes using the
program ‘anvi-refine’, and assigned taxonomy to resulting MAGs using NCBI’s
non-redundant protein sequence database with amino acid sequences of core
genes. The program ‘anvi-refine’ allows the identification and refinement of
population genome bins through an interactive interface by offering a number
of tools including (1) guiding hierarchical clustering dendrograms of contigs
(including one based on tetranucleotide frequencies and differential coverage
statistics across samples), (2) real-time completion and redundancy estimates
of binned contigs based on bacterial single-copy core genes77, (3) interfaces that
display nucleotide-level coverage statistics per gene and contig, (4) functional
annotations and synteny of genes, and (5) online sequence homology search
options for gene and contig sequences. These tools collectively help minimize the
inclusion of non-target contigs (such as eukaryotic contamination) in final bins,
especially in complex metagenomes78. Except for the manual refinement step, we
automated the processing of our raw sequencing data with a snakemake79 work-
flow anvi’o v5 implements (http://merenlab.org/2018/07/09/anvio-snakemake-
workflows/), and the Code availablility section reports necessary configuration files
to fully reproduce this analysis.

 DNA from the ovaries of 7 C. pipiens and 15 C. quinquefasciatus mosquitoes.
As the total DNA quantity from this step was only 5.83 ng, we also extracted DNA
from the abdomens of 15 C. quinquefasciatus that left us with a total of 76.63 ng.
To acquire high-molecular weight DNA from these low-biomass samples, we used
an in-house Phenol Chloroform protocol for total genomic DNA extraction.
Briefly, we used a chloridric acid-washed pestle adapted to the size of a micro-
centrifuge tube to gently grind tissue in cetyltrimethylammonium bromide buffer
(10 ml) mixed with betamercaptoethanol (20 µL) that we incubated for 15 min at
60 °C. We then added 200 µL of phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol and incubated
each microcentrifuge tube at room temperature while rotation shaking for 5 min.
To minimize inclusion of proteins, we centrifuged the tubes for 10 min at 8000 rpm
(5939 × g), removed the aqueous phase (the top layer), and placed it into fresh
tubes. We repeated those steps with chloroform:isoamyl alcohol and lastly with
isopropanol. We incubated microcentrifuge tubes for 10 min at room temperature
and mixed by inversion every 3 min. We then centrifuged those tubes for 10 min at
10,000 rpm (9279 × g), removed the top layer, and kept the sole DNA at the bottom
of the microcentrifuge tube. We next washed DNA with 400 µL of freshly prepared
70% ethanol and centrifuged tubes for 10 min at 10,000 rpm (9279 × g). Finally, we
kept microcentrifuge tubes in a speed vacuum for 10 min and eluted DNA with
20 uL of molecular grade water. During all laboratory steps, we performed smooth
and slow pipetting with cut pipette tips to avoid further shearing the DNA
molecules. To prepare mosquitoes' total DNA for sequencing, we used the Rapid
Barcoding Kit (SQK-RBK004) by Oxford Nanopore Technologies. We followed the
manufacturer protocols, except for one additional step, in which we supplemented
samples that did not meet the manufacturer DNA input mass recommendations
(400 ng) with linear double-stranded lambda DNA (New England Biolabs) for
‘padding’. We then used 1× Agencourt AMPure XP beads (A63882, Beckman
Coulter) for sample clean-up and concentration of pooled barcoded samples. A
MinION with a pristine R9.4/FLO-MIN106 flow cell (Oxford Nanopore Tech-
nologies) sequenced the final prepared library with a starting voltage of −180 mV
and a run time of approximately 20 h. While the flow cell had 1293 active pores
prior to the run, only 200 were active at the beginning of the run, dropping down
to 2 active pores by 20 h. We were not able to determine whether the low number
of initial pores and their rapid decline was due to remaining chemical residues
from our in-house Phenol Chloroform extraction protocol or a defective flow cell.
We used MinKNOW (v1.15.4) for live base-calling and Albacore (v2.1.7) to
de-multiplex our samples and convert raw FAST5 files to FASTQ files. For
downstream analyses, we only used reads with a minimum quality score of 7.
Pangenomic analysis and the metapangenome. Our analysis of the Wolbachia
pangenome followed the workflow outlined in ref. 80 and at http://merenlab.org/
2016/11/08/pangenomics-v2/. Briefly, we first generated an anvi’o genomes storage
database using the program ‘anvi-gen-genomes-storage’ for our four Wolbachia
MAGs and the wPip reference genome wPip Pel40 (NCBI Accession ID
NC_010981.1). We then used the program ‘anvi-pan-genome’ using the flag ‘–use-
ncbi-blast’, and parameters ‘–minbit 0.5’, and ‘–mcl-inflation 5’. This program
(1) uses the blastp program all vs. all to create a graph of similarities between pairs
of amino acid sequences, (2) removes bad hits using the ‘minbit heuristic’, (3) uses
the Markov Cluster algorithm to determine gene clusters, (4) calculates the
occurrence of gene clusters across genomes and the total number of genes they
contain, (5) realizes a hierarchical clustering analysis for gene clusters (based on
their distribution across genomes) and for genomes (based on shared gene clus-
ters), and finally (6) generates an anvi’o pangenomic database that stores all results
for downstream analyses. We used the program ‘anvi-display-pan’ to visualize gene
clusters and their distribution across the five genomes in anvi’o interactive interface
and summarized our manual selection of gene clusters using the program ‘anvi-
summarize’. To identify ‘phage-like’ gene clusters, we used blastn to search for
genes homologous to the five phage regions27 in the wPip Pel genome (hereafter
referred to as WOPip1–5). We finally used a custom R script (see the Code
availability section) to recover coverage values of each gene cluster using our
four metagenomes. We visualized the metapangenome using the program ‘anvi-
display-pan’.
Computing the density of single-nucleotide variants per genome and meta-
genome. To infer the extent of heterogeneity in metagenomes for each Wolbachia
MAG, we used the anvi’o program ‘anvi-gen-variability-profile’ to recover single-
nucleotide variants from each merged profile without any filters (following the
tutorial at http://merenlab.org/2015/07/20/analyzing-variability/). We then kept
only single-nucleotide variants that fall into the context of complete gene calls to
minimize erroneous variants that often emerge from mappig artefacts around
beginnings and ends of contigs and calculated the percentage of nucleotide posi-
tions in each genome that was not clonal in the metagenome.
Computing the average nucleotide identity between genomes. To compute the
level of similarity between the four Wolbachia MAGs and the wPip Pel reference
genome, we used the program ‘anvi-compute-ani’, which called PyANI v0.2.781 in
‘ANIb’ mode to align 1 kbp long fragments of the input genome sequences with the
NCBI’s blastn program to summarize the average nucleotide identity and align-
ment coverage scores.
PCR amplification of DNA. We used a set of specific primers on the four C. pipiens
individuals and three Wolbachia-free C. quinquefasciatus controls generated by TC
treatment using standard techniques. The presence of arthropod DNA was verified
by amplifying a ca. 708-bp fragment of the Cytochrome Oxidase I gene from
arthropod mitochondria using LCO1490: (5’- GGT CAA CAA ATC ATA AAG
ATA TTG G -3’) and HCO2198: (5’- TAA ACT TCA GGG TGA CCA AAA AAT
CA -3’) primers48. We checked for the presence of Wolbachia DNA by PCR
amplifying a ca. 438-bp fragment of the Wolbachia 16S rDNA gene using Wspec-F:
CAT ACC TAT TCG AAG GGA TAG and Wspec-R: AGC TTC GAG TGA AAC
CAA TTC primers49. The PCR conditions for both sets of primers included a
temperature regime of 2 min at 94 °C, followed by 29 cycles of 30 s at 94 °C, 45 s
at 49 °C, 1 min at 72 °C, and a final elongation of 10 min at 72 °C. To detect the
circularity of the plasmid-like genome, we designed new primers (listed in Results)
and used the following cycling parameters: 2 min at 95 °C, followed by 34 cycles
of (94 °C for 30 s, 58 °C for 45 s, and 72 °C for 2 min) with a final elongation of
5 min at 72 °C. Finally, to confirm the presence of the IS110 TE, we used primers
described in the Results section under the following PCR conditions: 2 min at
95 °C, followed by 34 cycles of (94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 45 s, and 72 °C for 30 s)
and a final elongation of 5 min at 72 °C. Amplifications by PCR were performed
using Platinium Taq DNA Polymerase High Fidelity (5 U/μL, Invitrogen).
Plasmid characterization. We used the Glimmer software within Geneious v8.1.9
(Biomatters, Ltd) to identify ORFs and used the NCBI databases for non-
redundant protein sequences and conserved domains82, SMART83, and HHpred84
(including SCOPe, Pfam, and COG) to manually annotate putative functions based
on amino acid sequence homology searches. We used the IS finder platform
(https://isfinder.biotoul.fr/) for IS homology search. The nucleotide analysis plugin
in Geneious for EMBOSS identified and illustrated the EP in the plasmid.
Figures. We visualized BLAST hits between pWCP and long read sequences using
Kablammo85 (http://kablammo.wasmuthlab.org/) and finalized all figures using
the open-source vector graphics editor Inkscape (https://inkscape.org/).
