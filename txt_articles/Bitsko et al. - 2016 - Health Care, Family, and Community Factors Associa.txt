and Developmental Disorders in Early Childhood — United States, 2011–2012

Sociodemographic, health care, family, and community 
attributes have been associated with increased risk for men-
tal, behavioral, and developmental disorders (MBDDs) in 
children (1,2). For example, poverty has been shown to have 
adverse effects on cognitive, socio-emotional, and physical 
development (1). A safe place to play is needed for gross motor 
development, and accessible health care is needed for preven-
tive and illness health care (3). Positive parenting and quality 
preschool interventions have been shown to be associated with 
prosocial skills, better educational outcomes, and fewer health 
risk behaviors over time (2). Protective factors for MBDDs are 
often shared (4) and conditions often co-occur; therefore, CDC 
considered MBDDs together to facilitate the identification of 
factors that could inform collaborative, multidisciplinary pre-
vention strategies. To identify specific factors associated with 
MBDDs among U.S. children aged 2–8 years, parent-reported 
data from the most recent (2011–2012) National Survey of 
Children’s Health (NSCH) were analyzed. Factors associated 
with having any MBDD included inadequate insurance, 
lacking a medical home, fair or poor parental mental health, 
difficulties getting by on the family’s income, employment dif-
ficulties because of child care issues, living in a neighborhood 
lacking support, living in a neighborhood lacking amenities 
(e.g., sidewalks, park, recreation center, and library), and liv-
ing in a neighborhood in poor condition. In a multivariate 
analysis, fair or poor parental mental health and lacking a 
medical home were significantly associated with having an 
MBDD. There was significant variation in the prevalence of 
these and the other factors by state, suggesting that programs 
and policies might use collaborative efforts to focus on specific 
factors. Addressing identified factors might prevent the onset 
of MBDDs and improve outcomes among children who have 
one or more of these disorders.
NSCH is a cross-sectional, nationally representative, 
random-digit–dialed telephone survey that collects information 
about U.S. children aged <18 years. The survey includes indi-
cators of child health and well-being, access to quality health 
care, family characteristics, and school and neighborhood 
environment.* Participating parents or guardians completed 
interviews about one randomly selected child (N = 95,677) 
per household. The interview completion rates were 54.1%

and 41.2% for landline and cell phone samples, respectively; 
the overall response rate was 23.0%.† Data were weighted to 
account for unequal probability of selection of each household 
and child and for nonresponse. Weighted estimates reflect 
the population of noninstitutionalized children in the United 
States and within each state.
Parents were asked, “Has a doctor or other health care 
provider ever told you that [child] had [specified disorder]?” 
A child was considered to have an MBDD if the parent or 
guardian reported any of the following: attention-deficit/
hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), depression, anxiety problems, 
behavioral or conduct problems such as oppositional defiant 
disorder or conduct disorder, Tourette syndrome, autism 
spectrum disorder, learning disability, intellectual disability, 
developmental delay, or speech or other language problems.
Analyses were restricted to the 35,121 U.S. children aged 
2–8 years (defined by Healthy People 2020 as “early child-
hood”) with data for sex and each disorder. Weighted preva-
lence estimates of having any MBDD, and the associations 
with sociodemographic, health care, family, and community 
factors were calculated using statistical software to account 
for the complex sampling. Given previously documented

among all eligible households, including those that were not successfully 
contacted. The cooperation rate is the percentage of households that completed 
interviews among all eligible households that were contacted. NSCH attempts 
to minimize nonresponse bias by incorporating nonresponse adjustments in 
the development of the sampling weights.
associations between health care, family, and community fac-
tors, an exploratory regression model was also fit to determine 
which of the health care, family, or community factors that 
were independently associated with any MBDD remained 
significant after adjusting for the others. Sociodemographic 
factors were not included in the model.
Overall, among U.S. children aged 2–8 years, 15.4% had 
at least one diagnosed MBDD, by parent report (Table 1). 
Sociodemographic factors associated with report of having an 
MBDD included male sex, older age (aged 4–5 or 6–8 years 
compared with 2–3 years), being non-Hispanic white, and 
living in a household with a higher poverty level (i.e., <200% 
of federal poverty level) or where English was the primary 
language spoken.
Specific factors most strongly associated with MBDDs in 
early childhood were fair or poor parental mental health, dif-
ficulty getting by on the family’s income, child care problems 
(among parents of children aged 2–3 years), and lacking a 
medical home. Factors with the highest prevalence among 
children with MBDDs included lacking a medical home, 
living in a neighborhood lacking amenities, difficulty getting 
by on family income, and living in a neighborhood in poor 
condition. When adjusted for the other significant health care, 
family, and community factors, an exploratory multivariate 
model showed that only lacking a medical home and fair or 
poor parental mental health remained significantly associated 
with having an MBDD (Table 2).

§ Federal poverty level is based on family income and family size and 
composition using federal poverty thresholds that are updated annually by 
the U.S. Census Bureau using the change in the average annual consumer 
price index for all urban consumers. Imputed income was used for 9.3% of 
children aged 2–8 years without reported household income.
¶ Based on the education of adult parents or respondents.
The prevalence of MBDDs and health care, family, and 
community factors among U.S. children aged 2–8 years varied 
by state (supplemental table at http://stacks.cdc.gov/view/
cdc/38108). Prevalence of having any disorder varied from 
10.6% in California to 21.5% in Arkansas and Kentucky. More 
than 90% of children received preventive care (i.e., parent or 
guardian reported that in the past 12 months, the child saw 
a health care provider for preventive medical care such as a 
physical exam or well-child checkup at least once) in each state.
Among health care factors, inadequate insurance was highest in 
South Carolina (26.5%), and lacking a medical home was highest 
in Arizona (52.2%); Vermont had the lowest prevalence of both 
inadequate insurance (14.7%) and lacking a medical home (27%).
The prevalences of difficulty getting by on the family’s 
income and child care problems were both highest in Arizona 
(34.9% and 21.8%, respectively); income difficulties were 
lowest in North Dakota (18.5%), whereas child care problems 
were lowest in Nevada (2.6%§). Fair or poor parental mental 
health prevalence was highest in the District of Columbia 
(19.1%) and lowest in Kansas (6.9%).
The District of Columbia had the highest prevalence of 
living in a neighborhood in poor condition (46.2%) but the 
lowest prevalence of living in a neighborhood without all of 
the reported amenities (26.7%); the lowest prevalence of living 
in a neighborhood in poor condition was 20% in Maryland, 
whereas the highest prevalence of living in a neighborhood 
without all of the reported amenities was 67.5% in Mississippi 
(67.5%). Finally, reported prevalence of lack of neighborhood 
support was highest in Arizona (32.9%) and lowest in North 
Dakota (7.9%).
Discussion
Mental, behavioral, and developmental disorders identified 
in childhood often persist into adulthood and are associated 
with increased risk for poorer school outcomes and employ-
ment opportunities, other adverse health conditions, earlier 
mortality, and considerable costs for persons with the disorders, 
their families, and society (2). Children are more likely to out-
grow speech or language problems or certain developmental 
delays than other MBDDs, particularly if they receive early 
intervention. In other disorders such as Tourette syndrome, 
some children might outgrow the condition by late adolescence 
but remain at increased risk for other disorders that are more 
likely to persist, including ADHD and obsessive-compulsive 
disorder. MBDDs can substantially affect health care, families, 
and communities. Children with MBDDs often require more 
health and therapy services than children without MBDDs. 
Families might face stress associated with the disorder itself 
or financial stress associated with treatment of the disorder. 
Communities might need to provide additional services and 
support for both children and families and might face lower 
productivity if the parent or guardian is unable to work (2). 
Thus, efforts to prevent the onset of MBDDs and to improve 
their identification and treatment in early childhood might 
improve health and well-being throughout the lifespan, with 
the potential to translate into cost savings and overall popula-
tion health improvements (2).
The data in this report included a number of sociodemo-
graphic factors associated with MBDDs, including poverty and 
living in a primarily English-speaking household. Household

§ Based on a negative response to one of four variables included in the following five questions: 1) whether the child has current health insurance coverage; 
2) whether the coverage is sufficient to meet the child’s needs; 3) whether the family pays out-of-pocket expenses, and if yes, 4) whether these expenses are 
usually or always reasonable; and 5) whether insurance allows the child to see needed health care providers.
 
¶ Based on a response of “none” to the question, “During the past 12 months, how many times did [child name] see a doctor, nurse, or other health care provider 
for preventive medical care such as a physical exam or well–child checkup?”
 ** Based on five component variables (personal doctor or nurse, usual source for sick and well care, family-centered care, problems getting needed referrals, and 
effective care coordination when needed) drawn from 19 survey items. To have a medical home, children must have a personal doctor or nurse, usual source of 
care, and family-centered care; children needing referrals or care coordination must also have those criteria met.
 
†† Based on responses of “fair or poor” (i.e., compared with excellent, very good, or good) to questions about maternal and paternal mental health. Maternal question: 
“In general, what is the status of [child name’s [mother’s/your] mental and emotional health?” Paternal question: “In general, what is the status of [child name]’s 
[father’s/your] mental and emotional health?”
 
§§ Based on responses of “very often” or “somewhat often” (i.e., compared with rarely or never) to “Since [the child] was born, how often has it been very hard to get 
by on your family’s income, for example, it was hard to cover the basics like food or housing?”
 
¶¶ Based on responses of “no” to “Is there someone that you can turn to for day-to-day emotional help with [parenthood/raising children]?”
 *** Regarding children aged 2–3 years, based on responses of “yes” to “During the past 12 months, did you or anyone in the family have to quit a job, not take a job, 
or greatly change your job because of problems with child care for [the child]?”
 ††† Based on responses of “no” to at least one of the following statements: “Please tell me if the following places and things are available to children in your neighborhood, 
even if [the child] does not actually use them”: 1) sidewalks or walking paths; 2) a park or playground area; 3) a recreation center, community center, or boys’ or 
girls’ club; 4) a library or bookmobile.
 §§§ Based on responses of “yes” to any of the following three questions: “In your neighborhood, is there litter or garbage on the street or sidewalk? How about poorly 
kept or rundown housing? How about vandalism such as broken windows or graffiti?”
 ¶¶¶ Based on responses of “definitely agree, somewhat agree, somewhat disagree, or definitely disagree” were scored for the following four statements about their 
neighborhood or community: “People in this neighborhood help each other out; we watch out for each other’s children in this neighborhood; there are people 
I can count on in this neighborhood; if my child were outside playing and got hurt or scared, there are adults nearby who I trust to help my child.” Responses 
were scored 1–4 and an average score was calculated; averages less than 2.25 indicated a “lack of support.”

or neighborhood?”
language might be reflective of increased access to health care 
(and thus increased likelihood of being diagnosed) or the 
level of acculturation, a factor that has been associated with 
risk behaviors and poorer health outcomes in some domains 
(5). The identified health care, family, and community factors 
associated with child MBDDs in this report have each previ-
ously been documented to be associated with poverty (6). Each 
significant factor might reflect the effect of insufficient parental 
and community resources to support optimal child develop-
ment and might contribute to chronic stress. Chronic stress in 
early childhood can impact lifelong health. A chronically acti-
vated physiologic stress response impacts the sympathetic ner-
vous system, metabolism, and the brain, resulting in increased 
risk for high blood pressure, obesity, inflammatory diseases, 
and mental and behavioral disorders (1). The prevalences of 
both poverty and MBDDs have been increasing among U.S.

children,¶ underscoring the need for public health strategies 
to prevent and treat MBDDs (7).
The factors most strongly associated with MBDDs in early 
childhood were lacking a medical home, fair or poor parental 
mental health, and difficulty getting by on the family’s income. 
These and the other factors varied widely by state and might 
inform state-level decisions regarding allocation of resources 
to improve early childhood health at the population level. 
Strategies that address socioeconomic (e.g., poverty) and 
community (e.g., neighborhood condition) factors form the 
foundation of the health impact pyramid framework where 
interventions have the greatest public health impact (8), includ-
ing demonstrated impacts into adulthood, and are likely to be 
cost-effective (2,9,10). Further analyses are needed to identify 
which factors might be the most effective targets to promote 
children’s health.
Because a large percentage of children were reported to 
receive preventive care, pediatric clinical settings might be 
one venue for identifying and possibly delivering services to 
children and families in need. For example, the American 
Academy of Pediatrics has published policy statements on 
screening for postpartum depression (e.g., one way to address 
poor maternal mental health), the medical home, recognizing

social determinants of health, and partnering with public 
health to address child health from a population perspective 
(3). Increased awareness of the association of these factors with 
MBDDs by agencies serving children, (e.g., health depart-
ments, schools, and community organizations) might improve 
referrals and stimulate partnerships to address early childhood 
health within established community settings (3).
The findings in this report are subject to at least five limita-
tions. First, the presence of MBDDs was based on parent report 
and might be subject to recall error or bias. Second, children 
with undiagnosed disorders were not included, and therefore, 
state estimates of these disorders might vary both by presence 
of disorders and likelihood of identification. Similarly, state 
data on health care, family, and community factors might be 
influenced by prevalence of MBDDs. Third, the cross-sectional 
nature of the data and reliance on parent report prevented 
drawing conclusions about the direction of the associations 
or about causality. Fourth, although the data were weighted 
for nonresponse, bias related to nonresponse might remain 
given the low response rate. Finally, a wide range of disorders 
were included and might be differentially related to health 
care, family, and community factors, and also likely vary in 
the extent to which they can be prevented.
These data support the Institute of Medicine recommenda-
tion that resources directed toward improving health care and 
supporting families and communities are needed to prevent 
mental, emotional, and behavioral disorders, and promote 
healthy development among all young children (2). Such 
investments would require substantial collaboration across 
public health, pediatric, and other agencies responsible for 
providing services to children, but could yield widespread 
benefits for early childhood and lifelong health (8).

Summary
What is already known about this topic?
Sociodemographic factors and environmental influences in 
early childhood have been demonstrated to have significant 
impact on development, mental health, and overall health 
throughout the lifespan.
What is added by this report?
This report provides recent national data documenting signifi-
cant associations of early childhood mental, behavioral, and 
developmental disorders (MBDDs) with sociodemographic, 
health care, family, and community factors. There was substantial 
variation in state estimates of these factors and early childhood 
MBDDs. The factors most strongly associated with MBDDs were 
fair or poor parental mental health, difficulty getting by on the 
family’s income, child care problems (among parents of children 
aged 2–3 years), and lacking a medical home. 
What are the implications for public health practice?
These data support the Institute of Medicine recommendation 
that resources directed toward improving health care and 
supporting families and communities are needed to promote 
healthy development among all young children. Collaborative, 
multidisciplinary strategies including public health and 
pediatric clinical partners might have the greatest impact given 
the broad types of factors associated with early childhood 
MBDDs and the large number of agencies working to support 
optimal child development.
