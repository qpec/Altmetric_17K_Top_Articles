A.M. Lozano et al. / A Phase II Study of DBS in Alzheimer’s Disease
Abstract.
Background: Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is used to modulate the activity of dysfunctional brain circuits. The safety and
efficacy of DBS in dementia is unknown.
Objective: To assess DBS of memory circuits as a treatment for patients with mild Alzheimer’s disease (AD).
Methods: We evaluated active “on” versus sham “off” bilateral DBS directed at the fornix-a major fiber bundle in the brain’s
memory circuit-in a randomized, double-blind trial (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01608061) in 42 patients with mild AD. We
measured cognitive function and cerebral glucose metabolism up to 12 months post-implantation.
Results: Surgery and electrical stimulation were safe and well tolerated. There were no significant differences in the primary
cognitive outcomes (ADAS-Cog 13, CDR-SB) in the “on” versus “off” stimulation group at 12 months for the whole cohort.
Patients receiving stimulation showed increased metabolism at 6 months but this was not significant at 12 months. On post-
hoc analysis, there was a significant interaction between age and treatment outcome: in contrast to patients <65 years old
(n = 12) whose results trended toward being worse with DBS ON versus OFF, in patients ≥65 (n = 30) DBS-f ON treatment
was associated with a trend toward both benefit on clinical outcomes and a greater increase in cerebral glucose metabolism.
Conclusion: DBS for AD was safe and associated with increased cerebral glucose metabolism. There were no differences
in cognitive outcomes for participants as a whole, but participants aged ≥65 years may have derived benefit while there was
possible worsening in patients below age 65 years with stimulation.
Keywords: Alzheimer’s disease, dementia, deep brain stimulation, fornix
INTRODUCTION
It is increasingly recognized that the patho-
logical processes involved in Alzheimer’s disease
(AD) causes focal synaptic dysfunction that disrupts
connected brain regions to produce widespread dis-
turbances in the function of circuits and networks
involved in cognition [1]. This is supported by strik-
ing regional deficits in cerebral glucose metabolism
and aberrations in structural and functional brain con-
nectivity that are characteristic of AD and that worsen
over its course [2–4]. These disruptions in brain net-
works are implicated in the pathogenesis of cognitive
impairment [5]. We propose an intervention to treat
brain circuit dysfunction in AD, as an alternative to
recent treatment strategies, including reducing brain
amyloid. As deep brain stimulation (DBS) has been
used to modulate the activity of motor circuits in
over 100,000 patients with Parkinson’s disease [6].
it may be possible to use this same approach to
modulate the activity of dysfunctional neural circuits
in AD. The hypothesis is that, just as DBS for the
neurodegenerative disorder Parkinson’s disease alle-
viatessymptomsbymodulatingpathologicalnetwork
activity, that DBS might similarly prove a clinically
beneficial therapy for AD.
We previously applied DBS to influence the activ-
ity of dysfunctional brain networks in AD in a Phase
I trial [7]. In that study (n = 6), DBS was applied to
stimulate the fornix (DBS-f), a fiber bundle carrying
approximately 1.2 million axons [8], that constitutes
the major projection linking various nodes within the
circuit of Papez. DBS-f was found to drive brain elec-
trical activity throughout this circuit and to increase
glucose metabolism in temporal and parietal areas
after 12 months [7], in contrast to the progressive
decrease in metabolism expected in AD [2]. While
the mechanisms underlying these DBS-f effects are
unknown, experiments in laboratory animals using
stimulation of the fornix, or other structures along
the Papez circuit, suggest that DBS may have neu-
rotrophic effects including increasing delivery of
endogenous trophic factors, facilitating expression of
synaptic proteins [9], and driving hippocampal neu-
rogenesis [10]. Interestingly, electrical stimulation of
this circuit in rodents [11, 12] and in patients with
epilepsy[13,14]improvedseveralaspectsofmemory
function.
We designed a multi-center, double-blind, random-
ized, controlled Phase II trial to evaluate the safety
of DBS-f in patients with mild AD with the sec-
ondary outcomes of assessing change in clinical and
functional imaging outcomes, and identifying char-
acteristics of responders. To isolate the impact of
continuous brain stimulation, and because surgical
trials are subject to “placebo” effects, we included a
sham stimulation control arm. The sham patients had
DBS-f electrodes implanted but received no stimu-
lation for 12 months, after which they crossed over
to active stimulation. Based on observations in the
Phase I study that patients with the best-preserved
cognition and brain circuits were better responders,
we targeted patients with mild AD [7, 15].
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study design and oversight
The design of the randomized controlled ADvance
study has been detailed previously [16]. ADvance
 A.M. Lozano et al. / A Phase II Study of DBS in Alzheimer’s Disease
779
was conducted at 7 clinical sites in the United States
and Canada with independent research ethics board
approval at each site. All procedures involving exper-
iments on human subjects were carried out in accord
with the Helsinki Declaration of 1975. All partici-
pants signed informed consent in person, with the
participation of a surrogate consenter.
Potential participants identified by sites were
assessed by an Eligibility Review Committee (ERC)
of neurosurgeons, neurologists, and psychiatrists to
(1) confirm diagnosis, (2) verify enrollment crite-
ria were met, and (3) document clear progression
of symptoms over the prior 12 months to maxi-
mize likelihood that the sham group would show
clinical progression over the trial year. The trial
was overseen by the Food and Drug Administra-
tion, Health Canada, and registered with http://www.
clinicaltrials.gov (NCT01608061).
Patients
Men and women aged 45–85 years with probable
AD dementia according to NIA/Alzheimer Associ-
ation criteria were enrolled [17]. Patients had mild
dementia with global Clinical Dementia Rating Sum
of Boxes (CDR-SB) of 0.5 or 1 and Alzheimer’s Dis-
ease Assessment Scale-13 (ADAS-Cog 13) scores
of 12–24 inclusive at both screen and baseline
(minimum score ≥ 4 on item 1). All had a care-
giver or informant who could reliably report on
daily activities and functioning. All were taking
a stable cholinesterase inhibitor medication dose
(donepezil, galantamine, or rivastigmine) for at least
2 months prior to study initiation. Exclusion crite-
ria included: Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) total
score ≥ 10 or ≥ 4 in any NPI domain-except apathy-
indicative of clinically significant neuropsychiatric
symptoms; and Modified Hachinski ischemia rat-
ings > 4 at screening. We excluded individuals at risk
for suicide or with psychiatric disorders other than
dementia. Subjects had to be free of contraindications
for surgery or exclusions for magnetic resonance
(MR) imaging (pacemakers, metal implanted in the
body) or positron emission tomography (PET) scan-
ning (insulin-dependent diabetes).
Surgery and stimulation
The surgical technique is very similar to that used
for DBS of Parkinson’s disease but with a different
anatomical target (bilateral fornix). Patients under-
went placement of Medtronic 3387 DBS electrodes
under local anesthesia as previously described [18].
The procedure involved placement of a Leksell
stereotactic frame and an MRI acquisition. Bilateral
burr hole openings were made 2 cm from the mid-
line at the level of the coronal suture. The electrodes
were inserted to lie 2 mm anterior and tangential to
the columns of the fornix with the distal contacts just
proximal to the mammillary bodies. Intraoperative
stimulation confirmed functioning of the electrodes
with placement near the hypothalamus. Stimula-
tion at high voltages at the deepest, most posterior
contacts elicited autonomic phenomena including
changes in heart rate, blood pressure, or sweating in
all patients. In a small number of patients, stimula-
tion voltages of 7 or higher from the higher contacts
elicited d´
ej`
a vu phenomena including vivid autobio-
graphical memories as previously described [7]. No
stimulation-induced effects were seen at 3.5 volts in
any patient. Once the electrodes were in place, a dual
channel pulse generator (Activa PC, Medtronic) was
implanted in the subcutaneous area below the clav-
icle and connected to the brain electrodes using an
extension tunneled between the head and chest.
Stimulation programming, randomization,
and masking
Two weeks after surgery, all patients had test stim-
ulation at each of the 8 electrode contacts (4 on each
side) and were randomized and then programmed to
either active or sham stimulation at the end of the
visit by the single un-blinded programmer. Contin-
uous stimulation was delivered at 130 Hz, between
3.0 to 3.5 Volts, with a pulse width of 90 microsec-
onds to the top, or second from top, of the 4 electrode
contacts. At this setting, similar to what is done in
Parkinson’s disease, the patients and physicians did
not report any acute effects and could not ascertain
whether the stimulation was on or off, thus preserving
the masked nature of treatment assignment. Patients
received continuous stimulation at the chosen setting
for 12 months without adjustment.
Safety outcomes
We assessed both acute (surgery through 30 days)
and long-term (30 days to 12 months post-op) safety
by monitoring serious and non-serious adverse events
(SAE/AEs). The former were defined as leading to
prolongation of hospital stay, new hospital admis-
sion, disability, or death. Acute cognitive effects were
assessed by comparing scores on the ADAS-Cog-13
 780
A.M. Lozano et al. / A Phase II Study of DBS in Alzheimer’s Disease
between baseline and 1 month post-op. Safety data
were reviewed and adjudicated in real time by a
masked internal Clinical Events Committee (CEC)
and at 6-month intervals by an unmasked external
Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB). To mon-
itor for adverse psychiatric outcomes previously
observed with DBS at every follow-up visit we con-
ducted a psychiatric examination and assessed the
Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale, and the
Young Mania Scale.
Clinical outcomes
The primary clinical outcomes were the ADAS-
Cog 13 and CDR-SB at 6 and 12 months. Secondary
outcomes at 6 and 12 months included the California
Verbal Learning Test-Second Edition (CVLT-II), the
Alzheimer’s Disease Cooperative Study Activities of
Daily Living scale (ACDS-ADL), and the NPI.
Imaging outcomes
Patients underwent 1.5T MR scans at baseline and
12 months and [18F]-2-deoxy-2-fluoro-D-glucose
PET (FDG-PET) at baseline and at 1, 6, and 12
months after surgery with the stimulators maintained
‘on’ in the active group and ‘off’ in the sham group
during the PET scans [7]. The imaging core at Johns
Hopkins was responsible for (1) establishing the PET
and MR protocols based on the Alzheimer’s disease
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) protocols [19–21],
(2) organizing the data from the 7 sites, (3) quality
control of PET and MR images, and (4) analysis of
PET data (using ADNI pre-processing methods).
The PET scans were performed on a PET/CT
scanner at each site. After a 5 mCi ± 10% radio-
tracer injection and a 30-min uptake interval (eyes
open, ears unoccluded), a CT transmission scan was
acquired followed by a static emission scan begin-
ning 40 min post-injection (20-min acquisition, the
last 10 min used for quantification). A standardized
uptake value (SUV) was calculated on a voxel-wise
basis using the following formula: (radioactivity con-
centration in each voxel)/(decay corrected injected
dose/body weight). The pre-processing and statis-
tical analyses of the PET SUV images were done
with Statistical Parametric Mapping, version eight
(SPM8, Institute of Neurology, London). A region of
interest (ROI) analysis was performed. The analysis
involved placement and editing of ROIs defined on
a template (Automated Anatomical Labeling atlas),
superimposed on each subjects’ pre-operative T1 MR
scanandcopyingoftheROIsontotheSUVPETscans
that were spatially normalized and co-registered to
the MRI in SPM8 [22]. Pre-specified ROIs were cho-
sen as outcome measures based on regions affected in
mild AD (temporal and parietal association cortices
and hippocampus), as well as sensory and motor cor-
tical regions relatively spared in mild AD that showed
increased glucose metabolism after 12 months of
DBS-f in the pilot study (pre and post central gyrus,
occipital cortex and cerebellum).
Analyses
The study was exploratory in nature and not
powered to detect a statistically significant differ-
ence between treatment arms. All analyses followed
intention-to-treat (ITT) principles. Descriptive statis-
tics compared treatment groups on baseline variables.
Between-group comparisons for change from base-
line were made using t-tests and 2-sided p-values at
each time point. For safety end points, counts and
rates along with corresponding two-sided 95% con-
fidence intervals are presented. All analyses were
performed with the use of SAS software, version 9.3.
RESULTS
Baseline patient characteristics are in Table 1. The
randomization led to groups well matched for key
demographic and clinical variables. The first patient
was implanted in May of 2012 and the last in April of
2014. As previously reported [16], 85 patients were
consented with 42 implanted and assigned to either
active (n = 21) or sham (n = 21) stimulation. Both
quantitative ROI analysis (data not shown) and visual
inspectionofthepre-operativePETscansshowedthat
all patients demonstrated the characteristic metabolic
pattern associated with AD (reductions in temporal
and parietal association cortices).
Safety outcomes
All observed adverse effects by category and
treatment assignment are in Table 2. Detailed sur-
gical safety results have been described previously
[20]. The surgery was well tolerated with patients
discharged 1–3 days post-op. There were no neuro-
logical surgical adverse effects. There were a total
of four acute serious device- or procedure-related
safety events in three patients for a rate of 7.1% of
events/patient (95% CI 1.5–19.5). One event involved
IPG infection, one involved moving a DBS lead to

the optimal position as defined by imaging, and the
others both involved post-op nausea (2 episodes in
one subject). The mean ADAS-Cog-13 scores for the
active or sham groups at 1 month after surgery were
28.0 (7.7) and 28.9 (7.4) almost identical to base-
line indicative of no cognitive adverse effects of the
procedure.
There were three long-term serious therapy-related
events (depression, suicidal ideation, and worsen-
ing confusion) in a single patient in the “off” arm
with no events in the “on” arm. One patient in the
“off” condition developed regional asymptomatic
encephalomalacia observed 113 days post-procedure
as previously reported [22]. Both acute and long-
term safety endpoints indicate the surgical procedure,
programming, and stimulation were well tolerated.
The independent DSMB concluded the adverse event
safety profile was as expected and had no concerns
during ongoing monitoring.
Clinical outcomes
For the group as a whole, the ADAS-Cog 13
and CDR-SB change scores for the “on” stimu-
lation and “off” stimulation groups were similar
over 12 months with both groups showing compa-

rable declines (Fig. 1a, b). Outcomes on secondary
clinical measures (CVLT-II, ADCS-ADL, and NPI)
were also similar across treatment arms (data not
shown).
PET imaging outcomes (Table 3; Fig. 2)
The “off” group demonstrated relatively small de-
creases in all regions (–1 to –5%) at 12 months.
In contrast, the “on” group demonstrated increased
metabolism, consistent with the pilot study (range
7–13%). The significant increases in glucose meta-
bolism in several brain regions (pre-central gyrus,
post-central gyrus, temporal association cortex,
hippocampus, parietal association cortex, occipital
cortex (cuneus), and cerebellar hemispheres) in the
ON versus OFF group at 6 months were not sustained
at the 12-month analysis. Decreases at 6 months in
the “off” group were greater than the decreases at 12
months. The greater decrease in metabolism in the
“off” group at 6 versus 12 months reflects different
patients (1 “off” and 2 “on” patients are missing 6
month scans). The results for the same “off” patients
at 6 and 12 months show the same degree of decrease
in metabolism at both time points within the magni-
tude of decrease expected in the course of AD. The
regional changes in metabolism in the ROI analy-
sis were consistent with voxel-wise analyses (SPM8;
data not shown).
Subgroup analysis
In a post-hoc multivariate regression analysis,
with a stepwise selection procedure, age was asso-
ciated with clinical outcomes (beta = –0.41; SE 0.18;
p = 0.028). Patients aged ≥65 (n = 30) “on” (n = 15)
versus “off” (n = 15), were well balanced on the
demographic and clinical variables shown in Table 1,
as were patients younger than 65 “on” (n = 6) versus
“off” (n = 6) (data not shown). The relatively smaller
cohort of younger patients (<65) in the study declined
more on both primary clinical outcomes whether or
not they received stimulation, with younger patients
“on” declining faster than those “off” (Fig. 1c, d).
After one year, patients less than 65 years of age “off”
stimulation increased their ADAS-cog-13 points by
8.3 ± 4.5 points while in those receiving stimulation,
the score increased by 18.7 ± 4.1 (Fig. 1c), a differ-
ence of 10.3 ± 6.1 (p-value 0.12). In addition, the 6
patients less than 65 years of age in the “on” group
showed deterioration as measured by the CDR-SB
scores with a value at 12 months of 4.0 ± 07 versus
0.5 ± 0.5 in the 6 patients in the “off” group (Fig. 1d),
a difference of 3.5 ± 0.7 (p-value < 0.001).
In contrast, older patients in the “on” group
declined less than patients “off” on both ADAS-Cog
13 and CDR-SB (Fig. 1e, f). The difference in
ADAS-Cog-13 scores worsening in in patients
aged ≥ 65 receiving stimulation versus no stimula-
tion was 4.5 ± 2.0 points at 9 months and 4.1 ± 2.6
at 12 months (Fig. 1e). Similar clinical benefit of the
“on” versus “off” stimulation group was observed in
the CDR-SB change scores in patients over 65 years
old (1.1 ± 0.7 points at 9 months; 1.4 ± 1.0 points at
12 months; Fig, 1f).
With regard to PET data, the <65 group in general
showed decreased metabolism both “on” and “off”,
while the ≥65 group showed increased metabolism
“on” stimulation that was greater in magnitude than
that observed in the entire group at 6 and 12 months
(range 14–20%; Table 4).
While the young and old patients did not differ
in baseline cognitive variables, a post-hoc compari-
son of pre-operative PET scans revealed significantly
lower metabolism in the young compared to the old
patients in temporal and parietal areas (middle tem-
poral gyrus, inferior parietal lobule, precuneus; –6 to
–11% decrease; p < 0.05).

baseline, 6 months or 12 months after continuous bilateral deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the fornix. Representative axial sections show
that patients in the “Off” group had stable or declining cortical glucose metabolism over time. In patients assigned to “On,” there were
increases in brain metabolism at 6 months, particularly in the temporal and parietal regions, that were sustained at 12 months. The color scale
indicates SUVs, with red showing highest, yellow and green intermediate and blue lowest. The patients remained on the same medications
from baseline to 12 months while receiving DBS.

DISCUSSION
In a 12-month sham-controlled trial of deep brain
stimulation of the fornix for AD, both neurosurgery
and 12 months of continuous stimulation appeared
to be safe and well tolerated. DBS had a clear neu-
robiological effect by increasing metabolism during
stimulation in brain regions affected by AD, in con-
trast to the progressive decline in metabolism in AD
[2]. There was no evidence of an overall clinical ben-
efit in the first twelve months of stimulation, possibly
because of the inclusion of patients under 65. Below
we highlight several important issues in the use of
DBS-f to treat AD.
Stimulation dosage
The choice of stimulation parameters was empir-
ical but somewhat arbitrary. We chose parameters
commonly used for DBS at other brain targets and
we aligned them with our experience in patients with
Parkinson’s disease and tremor. We do not know,
however, whether the chosen stimulation dose was
optimal, and we lacked a clinical outcome for adjust-
ing stimulation parameters, such as reduction of
tremor in DBS for Parkinson’s disease. Furthermore,
in experimental animals, increasing current delivery
to this circuit beyond what is optimal can interfere
with memory function [23]. However, in dystonia
and obsessive-compulsive disorder, DBS delivered at
higher current density settings, just under the win-
dow for side effects, has proven empirically to be
the optimal approach. In ADvance, the absence of
benefit may be related to insufficient dosing, or to
applying the dose at a suboptimal location along
the DBS lead. The possibility of adjusting stimula-
tion by modifying key parameters (frequency, pulse
width, and voltage), changing location of stimulation,
applying intermittent or cycling stimulation, or intro-
ducing stimulation holidays to recapture a waning
effect need to be examined. Until we identify a reli-
able short-term biological signal that predicts long
term, sustained benefit (a clinical, electrophysiolog-
ical, or imaging measure), choosing the parameters
of electrical stimulation for AD patients will remain
challenging.
Cerebral glucose metabolism
While as expected patients receiving sham stim-
ulation showed a decline in metabolism, patients
receiving stimulation showed increases in regions
affected in AD (temporal and parietal regions) as
well as regions that are relatively spared (sensory and
motor cortex, and cerebellum). The greatest increases
in glucose metabolism with DBS on were seen within
 A.M. Lozano et al. / A Phase II Study of DBS in Alzheimer’s Disease
785
6 months and appeared unsustained at 12 months.
With the caveat that the patients numbers are small
and that there are some missing time point data, the
findings suggest that as the illness progresses, the
brain’s ability to maintain glucose metabolism may
diminish despite circuit modulation by DBS. The
effect of stimulation on metabolism was greater in
patients ≥ 65 compared to those <65. The regional
increasesinmetabolismareconsistentwiththenotion
that DBS-f activates axons of the fornix, drives neural
activity trans-synaptically, and modulates the dys-
functional brain networks in AD.
Effect of age
Cognitive worsening was noted in all age groups,
however,youngerpatients(<65years)receivingstim-
ulation showed the greatest decline. Younger patients
(n = 12) may have worsened more with DBS-f “on”
whereas in older patients (n = 30) comparison of
trajectories on ADAS-Cog-13 and CDR-SB sug-
gested growing separation, suggesting a possible
benefit in this subgroup. Younger patients, constitut-
ing approximately 4% of all AD patients [24], were
overrepresented in ADvance (12/42 or 29%). These
observed differences in outcome as a function of age
are not well understood, but may be related to greater
brain atrophy and metabolic deficits [24–26] or a
more malignant course [27] in younger AD patients.
One explanation is that younger patients had more
severe brain pathology than older patients despite
being clinically comparable, such that DBS-f could
no longer be of benefit. Another explanation could
be that a greater proportion of the younger patients
may not have had AD brain pathology. However, all
patients demonstrated a typical AD metabolic pattern
in the pre-operative PET scans. Finally, the differ-
ence in response could have been driven by different
genetic and clinical phenotypes that were less respon-
sive to neural network modulation.
Conclusion
DBS-f appears to be safe in patients with mild AD.
Direct continuous stimulation of the fornix has poten-
tially important neurobiological effects modulating
the activity of brain networks that are dysfunctional in
AD as reflected in the increased glucose metabolism
observed at 6 months albeit not at 12 months, in
contrast to the natural history of AD. Further there
may be slowing of cognitive decline over one year
in patients 65 years of age and older. Taken together,
these findings are consistent with the pilot study and
support the continued evaluation of DBS-f in older
AD patients and inform the sample size calculation
for a phase III clinical trial. Further investigation of
DBS-f might include the development of approaches
for dose titration to maximize its benefit, better under-
standing of neurobiological mechanisms involved in
its effects, and the evaluation of long-term effects.
