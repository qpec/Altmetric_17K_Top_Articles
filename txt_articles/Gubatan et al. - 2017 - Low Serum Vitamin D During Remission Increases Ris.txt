Abstract
BACKGROUND & AIMS—Vitamin D levels have been associated with disease activity in 
patients with ulcerative colitis (UC), but it is unclear whether they affect the risk of disease 
relapse. We sought to determine the association between baseline vitamin D levels during a period 
of clinical remission and risk of subsequent UC relapse.
METHODS—We performed a physician-blinded prospective study of 70 patients with UC in 
clinical remission followed after a surveillance colonoscopy at a tertiary academic medical center. 
Serum samples were collected at the time of colonoscopy and baseline endoscopic and histologic 
activity were determined. Levels of 25-hydroxy-vitamin D were measured using an ELISA. The 
primary outcome was rate of clinical relapse, determined over 12 months.
RESULTS—The mean baseline vitamin D level was lower among patients with relapse (29.5 
ng/mL) than without (50.3 ng/mL) (P=.001). Remission vitamin D level (≤ 35 ng/mL) was 
associated with risk of clinical relapse (odds ratio [OR], 1.25; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.01–
1.56; P=.044) over 12 months, independent of endoscopic or histologic grade at enrollment. A 
receiver operating characteristic curve of vitamin D levels for the outcome of relapse had an area 
under the curve of 0.72; a serum level ≤ 35 ng/mL had a sensitivity of 70% (95% CI 46%–88%) 
and specificity of 74% (95% CI 57%-83%) for predicting risk of clinical relapse.
CONCLUSIONS—Serum levels of vitamin D ≤ 35 ng/mL during periods of clinical remission 
increase the risk of UC relapse. Clinical trials to obtain vitamin D levels above this threshold 
should be considered.

INTRODUCTION
Ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn’s disease are inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) that are 
chronic, idiopathic disorders of the gastrointestinal tract that are believed to result from a 
complex interplay between genetic, environmental, immune, and microbial factors [1,2]. 
Vitamin D has an emerging role as an environmental factor in the pathogenesis of 
autoimmune disorders including IBD [3,4]. The clinical significance of vitamin D has 
extended beyond its function in calcium homeostasis and bone metabolism with mounting 
evidence supporting its role in regulating immune responses. [5,6]. Vitamin D receptors are 
found to be expressed on a variety of immune cells and indeed vitamin D has numerous and 
multifaceted effects on the immune system. Vitamin D decreases the generation of pro-
inflammatory Th1 responses and increases the levels of anti-inflammatory Th2 cells. [7] 
Vitamin D promotes self-tolerance by inhibition of dendritic cell differentiation and 
maturation [8,9] and increases the number and function of T regulatory cells [10,11]. 
Vitamin D has also been implicated in modulating the ability of human macrophages to kill 
intracellular bacteria [12] as well as protecting the epithelial mucosal barrier in intestinal 
inflammation. [13]
Genetic polymorphisms in the vitamin D receptor (VDR) have been associated with 
susceptibility and disease severity in patients with ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease. 
[14,15]. In mice models of experimental colitis, VDR knockout mice developed severe 
inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract and administration of the active form of Vitamin D 
(1,25D3) attenuated this effect of VDR deficiency on the development of severe colitis. [16] 
In human studies, vitamin D levels are inversely related to disease severity in patients with 
IBD. In two cross-sectional studies, vitamin D deficiency was associated with disease 
activity in both ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease. [17,18] One retrospective study 
demonstrated the association between vitamin D deficiency and lower quality of life indices 
and increased disease activity in patients with Crohn’s disease, but not in patients with UC. 
[19] Several other studies in Crohn’s disease patients have shown that higher vitamin D 
status was associated with reduced risk of disease development, normalization of vitamin D 
levels reduced risk of surgery, and that vitamin D levels increase and are responsive to 
treatment with biologics. [20,21,22]
Prospective studies exploring the effects of vitamin D on clinical outcomes and relapse are 
lacking, especially in patients with ulcerative colitis. One small prospective cohort of 
patients with mild to moderate Crohn’s disease demonstrated that raising the serum Vitamin 
D levels to normal levels was associated decreased disease index scores. [23] In a 
randomized clinical trial of vitamin D supplementation in Crohn’s disease patients, there 
was a trend towards reduced risk of clinical relapse, but was ultimately not significant. [24] 
Although vitamin D status has been implicated to correlate with disease severity, the clinical 
significance of low vitamin D levels among patients with ulcerative colitis in clinical

 remission is unclear. We thus aimed to explore the effect of vitamin D levels on risk of 
relapse in patients with UC in clinical remission. We also assessed the correlation between 
vitamin D levels and presence of baseline endoscopic and histologic inflammation.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Design and Patient Enrollment
We conducted a prospective study of patients with UC in clinical remission, Simple Clinical 
Colitis Activity Index (SCCAI) ≤ 2, (Supplementary Figure 1) [25,26] who were recruited 
after a surveillance colonoscopy from the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Center at Beth Israel 
Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC), Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA from 2009–
2012. The study was approved by the BIDMC institutional review board (IRB) under 
protocol # 2009P000314. From a cohort of 170 enrolled subjects, 70 had a baseline serum 
sample collected at the time of index colonoscopy. After the study follow-up period was 
completed, blinded investigators (JG, SM) measured serum vitamin D levels in these de-
identified samples. Age, gender, ethnicity, smoking status, creatinine, duration of disease, 
extent of disease, relevant medications (current NSAIDs, current 5-ASA, current 6MP/AZA, 
current anti-TNF-α, steroids in the past year, and vitamin D supplementation), and season of 
enrollment were recorded for each patient. Baseline laboratory values (white blood cell 
count, hematocrit, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and C-reactive protein) were also 
obtained. We did not assess for baseline dietary vitamin D intake, assess for initiation of 
vitamin D supplementation during the period of follow-up, or actively supplement patients 
with vitamin D based on baseline levels.
Assessment of Baseline Endoscopic and Histologic Inflammation and Clinical Relapse
Each enrolled patient had a clinically-indicated surveillance colonoscopy. During the index 
colonoscopy, endoscopic activity was classified using the sigmoidoscopy sub-score of the 
Mayo activity index based on the most inflamed segment of the colon. [27] Histological 
activity in all segments was classified using the Geboes score by a GI pathologist blinded to 
endoscopic scores. [28] For each patient, a total Geboes score was assigned to biopsies from 
each colonic segment and the highest score (most inflamed segment) was used as the 
cumulative histologic score. In our study, we defined endoscopic inflammation as a Mayo 
endoscopic score (MES) ≥ 2 Histologic inflammation was defined as a Geboes histologic 
score ≥ 3. “Clinical relapse” during the follow-up period was defined as a SCCAI score > 2, 
medication intensification, or UC-related hospitalization at any time during our follow-up 
period of 12 months. Medication intensification was defined by an increase in dose of 
current regimen, addition of another medication, or change in class of medication due to 
symptom relapse.
Vitamin D Measurement and Receiver Operator Characteristic Curve
Serum vitamin D levels (25(OH)D) were measured by using a commercial enzyme-linked 
immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit (Calbiotech, San Diego, CA) according the 
manufacturer’s instructions. A Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve of vitamin D 
levels for the outcome of clinical relapse was constructed. A vitamin D level threshold of ≤ 
35 ng/mL was determined to have the greatest association for risk of clinical relapse in

 univariate and multivariate analysis (Supplementary Table 1) and thus chosen as our 
threshold level for further analyses. We compared risk of clinical relapse among patients 
with vitamin D level ≤ 35 ng/mL vs level > 35 ng/mL. To account for seasonal variations in 
vitamin D in New England, the year was dichotomized to a “low sunlight season” 
(September to February) and a “high sunlight season” (March to August). Sunlight season 
was included as a co-variate in our univariate analysis for risk of clinical relapse.
Data Analysis
The rate of clinical relapse, predictive value of clinical variables on the primary outcome, 
odds ratio (OR) with its 95 % confidence interval (CI), and p-values were assessed using 
JMP 11.0 (SAS Institute Inc., North Carolina). Dichotomous variables were analyzed for 
outcomes using χ2 test or Fisher’s exact test where appropriate, and continuous variables 
analyzed using t-test if normally distributed, or Wilcoxon test for non-normal data. 
Correction for multiple testing was included. All variables were initially analyzed in a 
univariate fashion to determine their association to clinical relapse. P-values of factors that 
showed evidence of an effect on clinical relapse (P < 0.05) were then analyzed on the 
multivariate regression analysis. Given that mucosal healing been associated with risk of 
clinical relapse in patients with ulcerative colitis [29,30], we constructed models accounting 
for the individual effects of endoscopic and histologic inflammation. We also performed a 
subgroup analysis restricted to patients with both clinical (SCCAI ≤ 2) and endoscopic 
(MES ≤1) remission while accounting for the confounding effects of underlying histologic 
inflammation (Geboes grade ≥ 3). Finally, we also performed a time to event analysis to 
detect a difference in time to clinical relapse among patients with vitamin D ≤ 35 ng/mL vs 
vitamin D > 35 ng/mL. For our multivariate analysis, model building was based on forward 
stepwise logistic regression, with a p value of 0.05 required for entry. All figures were 
generated using GraphPad Prism (version 5.0; GraphPad Software Inc., La Jolla, CA).
RESULTS
Baseline Patient Characteristics
Table 1 details the baseline phenotype of the enrolled cohort. The mean serum Vitamin D 
level in the cohort was 44 ng/mL (±29). Only 8 patients (11.4%) had steroid use in the past 
year. Vitamin D supplementation was reported by 42 patients (60%). Among the seventy 
patients enrolled, endoscopic inflammation was present in 9 patients (13%), while histologic 
inflammation was present in 32 patients (46%) at baseline. A multivariate analysis of the 
effects of clinical variables on the presence of baseline endoscopic or histologic 
inflammation highlighted that a vitamin D level ≤ 35 ng/mL was independently associated 
with increased presence of endoscopic inflammation (OR 1.29, 95% CI 1.07–1.85, P < 0.01) 
or histologic inflammation (OR 1.46, 95% CI 1.13–1.88, P = 0.005) at baseline.
Vitamin D Levels and Receiver Operator Characteristic Curve
All patients who later relapsed had a SCCAI >2 at follow-up. Clinical relapse outcomes in 
our cohort included: SCCAI >2 alone (N= 5), SCCAI >2 with resulting medication 
intensification (N=13), and SCCAI >2 with resulting medication intensification and 
hospitalization (N= 2). As shown in Figure 1, mean baseline vitamin D level was lower in

 those who later relapsed (29.5 ng/mL), than those who did not (50.3 ng/mL, P = 0.001). A 
Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve of baseline serum vitamin D levels for the 
outcome of 12-month clinical relapse had an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.72 (p<0.01) 
(Figure 2). A serum vitamin D level of ≤ 35 ng/mL had a sensitivity of 70% (95% CI 
46%-88%) and specificity of 74% (95% CI 57%-83%) for predicting subsequent risk of 
clinical relapse. An analysis of the effect of various serum vitamin D level thresholds on risk 
of subsequent of clinical relapse is summarized in Supplementary Table 1.
Vitamin D Threshold and Risk of Clinical Relapse
The rate of clinical relapse over 12 months for patients with a vitamin D level ≤ 35 ng/mL vs 
patients with vitamin D level > 35 ng/mL was 20% vs 9 % (P = 0.003), respectively. Table 2 
summarizes the univariate analysis of effect of clinical variables on clinical relapse; an 
increased risk of clinical relapse was associated with vitamin D level ≤ 35 ng/mL (OR 1.26, 
95% CI 1.16–1.75, P =0.001), steroid use in the past year (OR 1.46, 95% CI 1.05–2.04, P = 
0.026), and histologic inflammation (OR 1.52, 95% CI 1.22–1.89, P <0.001). Patients with 
vitamin D ≤ 35 ng/mL also had a shorter time to clinical relapse (P < 0.001, by Log Rank 
Mantel Cox) compared to UC patients with Vitamin D > 35 ng/mL (Figure 3). In our 
multivariate effects model, baseline vitamin D level ≤ 35 ng/mL was associated with 
increased risk of clinical relapse (OR 1.25, 95% CI 1.01–1.56, P =0.044) even after 
adjusting for the effects of baseline histologic inflammation (Table 3).
DISCUSSION
In this prospective cohort study of seventy patients with ulcerative colitis, we demonstrate 
for the first time that vitamin D levels are associated with baseline endoscopic and histologic 
inflammation severity during clinical remission, and are independently associated with the 
longitudinal risk of clinical relapse. These results suggest that vitamin D status is not only 
linked to current disease severity, but also has an impact on future risk of clinical relapse.
To our knowledge, this is the first prospective study demonstrating the effect of vitamin D 
levels during remission on clinical outcomes among ulcerative colitis patients. There have 
been no previous clinical trials and few prospective studies exploring the role of vitamin D 
on ulcerative colitis clinical outcomes. One analysis of an epidemiological cohort by 
Ananthakrishnan et al [21] demonstrated that low vitamin D levels was associated with 
clinical relapse in the form of increased risk of hospitalizations and surgeries. The results of 
our study are consistent with their finding that low vitamin D predisposes patients to clinical 
relapse. However, their study did not control for UC disease severity or account for the effect 
of baseline inflammation in their multivariate analysis. Our study differs in that we restricted 
enrollment only to patients in clinical remission and adjusted for confounding effects of 
endoscopic and histologic inflammation in our analyses.
Previous studies have also shown that vitamin D levels are inversely related to UC disease 
activity. These studies of disease activity were based mainly on symptom scores and quality 
of life surveys. [18,19,31] Our study supports these previous findings that vitamin D is a 
marker of disease activity in UC and adds further to the literature by demonstrating that 
vitamin D levels also reflect inflammatory activity at the endoscopic and histologic level

 beyond the clinical phenotype. Taken together, low serum vitamin D levels may be a useful 
biomarker for the detection of inflammation in UC patients in the absence of significant 
clinical symptoms.
Our finding that low vitamin D levels increases risk of clinical relapse in UC patients in 
remission may be interpreted in several ways. One explanation is that the immunoprotective 
and anti-inflammatory properties of vitamin D diminishes with lower levels and this directly 
leads to subsequent inflammation and clinical relapse. Another explanation is that low 
vitamin D levels was an effect of increased disease activity and that the risk of clinical 
relapse was mediated through the effects of baseline inflammation. Low baseline vitamin D 
levels measured in our cohort was not due to clinical disease activity as the patients enrolled 
in our study were in clinical remission. Although a subset of patients in our cohort had 
endoscopically and histologically active disease, our models adjusted for the effect of this 
baseline inflammation in our analysis. We also performed a subgroup analysis restricted 
only to patients in clinical and endoscopic remission and after adjusting for histologic 
inflammation in our multivariate analysis, low vitamin D was still associated with risk of 
clinical relapse. Thus, our results demonstrate that low vitamin D impacts risk of clinical 
relapse independent of subclinical inflammation.
Our study has several major strengths. First, our study was prospective and provided clarity 
of temporal sequence regarding our exposure of low vitamin D levels and outcome of 
clinical relapse. Second, our study was blinded: investigators measuring baseline serum 
vitamin D levels were blinded to subsequent relapse status to avoid selection bias at time of 
analysis and likewise, our investigators assessing relapse during followup periods were 
blinded to baseline vitamin D levels. Third, our cohort was limited to UC patients in clinical 
remission, which allowed us to isolate the independent effects of vitamin D levels on risk of 
clinical relapse. Fourth, vitamin D status was based on direct vitamin D measurements from 
serum obtained at time of enrollment rather than from ICD-9 codes for vitamin D deficiency, 
random vitamin D values from the medical record, or from estimates of serum vitamin D 
calculated from diet, physical activity, and other predictors of vitamin D levels. Finally, our 
study focused solely on UC patients, a population that warrants greater attention regarding 
the clinical role of vitamin D. Generalizations regarding the effect of vitamin D on 
inflammatory bowel disease as a group may not be appropriate as there genetic and 
immunologic differences in the pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease.
Our study has several limitations that merit attention. First, our sample size was small and 
may not be representative of the general UC population. Furthermore, the generalizability of 
our findings is limited only to UC patients in remission. Second, our study was based on a 
single measurement of serum vitamin D at time of enrollment, which may not reflect a 
patient’s baseline levels and does not take into account the possibility of fluctuations over 
the course of 12 months. One large scale epidemiological study by Jorde et al [32] involving 
long term tracking of serum vitamin D levels acknowledged that although there are 
fluctuations in serum vitamin D levels, they are unlikely to have substantial improvements 
over time. Their study supported the use of a single serum vitamin D measurement to predict 
future health outcomes. Third, our study is observational and thus is limited by the inability 
to account for potential unmeasured confounders. In particular, our study did not take into

 account baseline dietary vitamin D intake, BMI, physical activity, parathyroid hormone 
levels, malabsorptive conditions, medications that affect vitamin D levels, or adherence to 
medical therapy. Finally, although our cohort enrolled patients with clinically quiescent UC, 
we did not restrict our enrollment to patients with endoscopic and histologic remission, 
which raises the possibility that subclinical inflammation rather than low vitamin D levels is 
contributing to risk of relapse. However, we adjusted for the confounding effects of baseline 
endoscopic and histologic inflammation in our subgroup analysis and multivariate models.
The results of our study have several clinical implications. First, although currently not part 
of regular surveillance and standard of care in ulcerative colitis patients, our findings support 
the need for routine measurement of serum vitamin D levels. Second, our study suggest a 
role of low vitamin D as a maker of endoscopic and histologic inflammation in the absence 
of significant clinical symptoms which may in turn be used to risk-stratify patients. Third, 
our findings provide a rationale for vitamin D supplementation in maintenance therapy in 
patients with ulcerative colitis. Maintaining serum vitamin D levels above specified 
thresholds during periods of clinical remission may be protective against subsequent clinical 
relapse.
In conclusion, our study provides evidence that low vitamin D levels (≤ 35 ng/mL) correlate 
with endoscopic and histologic inflammation and are associated with increased risk of 
subsequent clinical relapse during periods of clinical remission. Vitamin D is an affordable, 
accessible, and relatively nontoxic supplement that may have protective effects in the 
maintenance of clinical remission in patients with ulcerative colitis. Clinical trials of vitamin 
D therapy to obtain vitamin D levels above this threshold should be considered to 
definitively establish its impact on ulcerative colitis outcomes.

Time to Event Analysis of Effect of Vitamin D Levels on Risk of Clinical Relapse in 
Patients with Ulcerative Colitis in Remission. Patients with vitamin D ≤ 35 ng/mL had a 
shorter time to clinical relapse (p< 0.001, by Log Rank Mantel Cox) compared to UC 
patients with Vitamin D > 35 ng/mL.
