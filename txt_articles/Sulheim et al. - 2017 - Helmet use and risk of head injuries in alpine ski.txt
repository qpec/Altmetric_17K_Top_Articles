ABSTRACT
Background In a previous study, we concluded that a
safety helmet can reduce the risk for head injury by
60%. Other studies reported similar effects, resulting in
a general recommendation to wear a helmet while skiing
or snowboarding.
Aim To determine the effect of the expected increased
helmet wear on the risk of head injury one decade after
the recommendation.
Methods Ski patrols reported injury cases in major
Norwegian alpine ski resorts. Injury type, helmet use and
other risk factors were recorded. A multiple logistic
regression analysis was used to assess the relation
between individual risk factors and the risk of head
injuries by comparing head injured skiers (cases) with
skiers and snowboarders who reported other injuries
(controls).
Results Helmet use was associated with improved odds
for head injuries (OR: 0.45, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.60;
p<0.001) in 2002; this effect was attenuated in 2010
(OR: 0.79, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.98; p=0.02), and not
significant in 2011 (OR: 0.80, 95% CI 0.60 to 1.06;
p=0.12). For potentially severe head injuries, the
protective effect of using a helmet was better sustained
over the observation period, from an OR of 0.44 (95%
CI 0.28 to 0.68, p<0.001) in 2002 to an OR of 0.74
(95% CI 0.57 to 0.97, p=0.02) in 2010 and 0.67
(95% CI 0.47 to 0.96; p=0.03) in 2011.
Conclusions We observed an unexpected reduction in
the protective effect of a skiing helmet. This may be due
to new skiing trends in the alpine resorts.
INTRODUCTION
Helmet use in alpine skiing and snowboarding has
been a contentious issue for many years. Haid first
introduced the issue of wearing a safety helmet
while skiing in 1955.1 Mandatory helmet use for
children up to 17 years was first advocated in
1983.2 Still, helmet use among adults did not
become common until the current decade, after
several studies had led to the same conclusion that
head injury risk among skiers and snowboarders is
reduced by wearing a helmet and with no evidence
of increased risk of neck injury.3–8
In 2005, Hagel et al4 reported a 29% reduction
in head injury risk for skiers and snowboarders
wearing a helmet at 19 ski areas in Quebec,
Canada. On the basis of a case–control study in
eight major Norwegian alpine resorts during the
2002 winter season, comparing 3277 injured skiers
and snowboarders with 2992 non-injured controls,
we concluded that using a helmet was associated
with a 60% reduction in the risk for head injury
(57% for severe head injuries).3 In 2008, Mueller
et al9 reported a 15% reduction in head injuries
with helmet use. Another study looked at head,
face and neck injuries among children, and found
an increased risk among those who did not wear a
helmet.5 A retrospective cohort study by Greve
et al10 showed a 5.8-fold decreased incidence in
loss of consciousness when hitting the head when
using a skiing helmet. Rhugani et al,11 in a retro-
spective
study
of
skiers
with
skull
fractures,
reported that the risk of a skull fracture was
10.5-fold higher among those not wearing a helmet
compared with helmet users. On the basis of self-
reported injury data from 2986 neck injured skiers
and snowboarders in Quebec covering the period
from 1995–1996 to 2004–2005, Hagel et al12 con-
cluded that helmets did not increase the risk of
neck injuries or cervical spine fractures in skiers
and snowboarders. On the basis of the above
studies, recent reviews have also concluded that
safety helmets decrease the risk and severity of
head injuries in alpine skiing and snowboarding by
roughly 40%, without increasing the risk of neck
injuries or risk-taking behaviour.6 7 13
According to the 2012/2013 National Ski Areas
Association (NSAA) National Demographic Study,
70% of skiers and snowboarders wore helmets, a
dramatic increase from the 2002/2003 season, when
only 25% wore helmets.14 W
e therefore wanted to
repeat our study on Norwegian skiers and snow-
boarders,3 expecting to find a similar increase in
the proportion of helmet users and hypothesising
that, as a consequence, there would be a substantial
reduction in head injuries.
METHODS
Ski patrols at major Norwegian ski resorts registered
injuries during the 2002, 2010 and 2011 winter
seasons. This study was based on anonymised data
from the Norwegian Ski Lift Association injury and
marketing research databases.
An injury was recorded when a skier or snow-
boarder was treated by or consulted the ski patrol
or first aid room staff after an injury in the skiing/
snowboarding area during skiing/snowboarding or
lift transport. To qualify for the ski patrol, the per-
sonnel are required to go through a structured pro-
gramme of first aid education. A standard form was
used to record personal data (age, gender, national-
ity), as well as information about equipment used
(alpine skis, telemark skis (turning with free heel
lift), snowboard, sleigh or other), the use of helmet
(yes/no), rented or own equipment (yes/no), previ-
ous ski school attendance (yes/no) and skiing

 ability. Skiing ability was classified into four categories (begin-
ner, intermediate, good or expert) based on self-reported
performance of turns.1
In addition, recordings were made of whether the injury
occurred on the prepared piste, in park areas (terrain parks, areas
within the ski resort with jumps, rails, obstacles), off-piste
(outside groomed runs) or while taking the ski lift. The anatomi-
cal location (ranked from highest to lowest: head, neck, back,
chest/tummy, shoulder, arm, wrist, hand, thigh, knee, leg, ankle,
foot) and injury type (fracture, sprain, contusion, skin wound,
illness) was recorded, as well as whether the patient needed
further evaluation and treatment by physician or at a hospital, as
assessed by the ski patrol. W
e defined such patients as potentially
severe cases. Facial injuries were included among head injuries,
while neck injuries represented a separate category. In cases with
multiple injuries to the same person, only the highest ranked
injury was recorded. In head injury cases with multiple injuries,
we always ranked the head injury as the most severe.
Cases were skiers with injuries to the head, while as controls
we used skiers and snowboarders who reported other injuries
than head injuries (ie, arm, leg, trunk) at the same ski area in
the same year. Fisher’s exact tests were used to compare
characteristics between groups. W
e used logistic regression ana-
lysis to estimate the relationship between helmet use and head
injuries. To select potential confounders, we performed univari-
ate analyses of the relationships to both head injuries and
helmet use. Factors with p<0.20 were used as adjustment
factors for potential confounding in the logistic models. Owing
to the large number of outcomes, it was not necessary to limit
the number of variables in the model. A test of interaction
between helmet use and study year was performed by adding a
cross product term between the two variables together with the
two linear terms, adjusting for the other covariates. In addition,
we performed individual logistic regression analyses with and
without each individual potential confounder to estimate the
effect on the helmet use estimate on head injury risk, and we
included confounders where the coefficient was 10% or more.
A W
ald test was used for significance testing. W
e used SPSS
(V
.22.0. Armonk, New York, USA) for the analyses. ORs are pre-
sented with their 95% CIs. A two-sided α level of 0.05 was con-
sidered statistically significant.
RESULTS
W
e recorded 11 108 injured persons, 3276 in 2002, 4396 in
2010 and 3436 in 2011. In 2002, 17.6% of these were head
injuries and we observed a 13.1% relative reduction in the pro-
portion of head injuries to 15.3% in 2010 (p<0.01 vs 2002) and
15.4% in 2011 (p<0.05 vs 2002) (table 1). During the same
decade, helmet use increased substantially among injured skiers
and snowboarders, from 23.8% in 2002 to 68.1% in 2010
(p<0.001 vs 2002) and 77.1% in 2011 (p<0.001 vs 2002).
Table 1 shows the distribution of injuries in relation to other
candidate risk factors in 2002, 2010 and 2011. The proportion
of injured skiers and snowboarders who defined themselves as
experts increased from 2002 to 2010 (p<0.01 vs 2002) and
2011 (p<0.01 vs 2002). In addition, a greater proportion of
injuries occurred in park areas in 2010 (p<0.001 vs 2002) and
2011 (p<0.001 vs 2002). There were also changes in the equip-
ment used with a greater proportion of injured alpine skiers in
2010 (p<0.01 vs 2002) and 2011 (p<0.01 vs 2002). In the
same period, the proportion of injured snowboarders was
reduced (p<0.001 vs 2002 in 2010, p<0.001 vs 2002 in
2011), as was that of injured telemark skiers (p<0.01 vs 2002
in 2010, p<0.01 vs 2002 in 2011). Apart from these changes,
only minor differences were observed over the years in the dis-
tribution of other characteristics (table 1).
Table 2 shows the univariate relationship between head inju-
ries and each of the candidate risk factors in 2002, 2010 and
2011. Head injuries were less common among those wearing a
helmet than those not wearing a helmet in 2002 (OR: 0.57,
95% CI 0.45 to 0.73, p<0.001); this difference was less pro-
nounced in 2010 (OR: 0.82, 95% CI 0.68 to 0.99, p<0.05)
and 2011 (OR: 0.90, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.11, p=0.21). There was
a continuing gender difference with favourable odds for females
(OR: 0.70 in 2002, 95% CI 0.58 to 0.85, p<0.001; OR: 0.82
in 2010, 95% CI 0.68 to 0.98, p=0.03; OR: 0.80 in 2011,
95% CI 0.66 to 0.98, p=0.03). Experienced skiers and snow-
boarders had greater odds of being head injured in 2002 (OR:
1.43, 95% CI 1.18 to 1.72, p<0.001), 2010 (OR: 1.22, 95%
CI 1.03 to 1.47, p=0.03) and 2011 (OR: 1.25, 95% CI 1.02 to
1.52, p=0.03). Previous skiing instruction was not associated
with the proportion of head injuries at any time.

 In table 3, we compare potential risk factors for potentially
severe head injuries. Of the 1781 head injuries recorded, 925
were classified as potentially severe, 262 in 2002 (45.3%), 387
in 2010 (56.2%) and 276 in 2011 (52.1%). In 2002, wearing a
helmet improved the odds for potentially severe head injuries
(OR: 0.50, 95% CI 0.35 to.70, p<0.001); this effect was atte-
nuated in 2010 (OR: 0.70, 95% CI 0.62 to 0.85, p<0.001),
and 2011 (OR: 0.77, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.00, p=0.06). There was
a higher proportion of potentially severe head injuries in injured
older
skiers
and
snowboarders
(>13 years)
compared
to
younger (OR: 1.57 in 2002, 95% CI 1.01 to 0.2.45, p=0.04;
OR: 1.77 in 2010, 95% CI 1.27 to 2.46, p<0.001; OR: 1.20
in 2011, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.64, p=0.32). Also, skiing ability
seems to be associated with the odds for potentially severe head
injuries, with good and expert skiers and snowboarders consist-
ently having worse odds (OR: 1.38 in 2002, 95% CI 0.1.07 to
0.1.79, p<0.01); in 2010: 1.25, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.54, p<0.05;
(OR: 1.66 in 2011, 95% CI 1.09 to 2.56. p=0.01).
Table 4 shows the relationship between participant characteris-
tics and odds for head injuries in 2001, 2010 and 2011 analysed
using multiple logistic regression analyses. Helmet use was asso-
ciated with favourable odds for head injuries (OR: 0.45, 95% CI
0.34 to 0.60; p<0.001) in 2002; this effect was attenuated in
2010 (OR: 0.79, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.98; p=0.02), and not signifi-
cant in 2011 (OR: 0.80, 95% CI 0.60 to 1.06; p=0.12), when
adjusted for potential confounders (age, sex, nationality, skiing
ability, location and equipment). The test of interaction between
helmet use and study year was statistically significant (p=0.001).
The
associations
with
age,
gender and
ability
were
also
weakened.
For potentially severe head injuries, the protective effect of
using a helmet was better sustained over the observation period,

to an OR of 0.74 (95% CI 0.57 to 0.97, p=0.02) in 2010 and
0.67 (95% CI 0.47 to 0.96; p=0.03) in 2011, adjusted for the
same potential confounders (table 5). The test of interaction
between helmet use and study year was statistically significant
(p=0.038). The gender difference was attenuated during the
same period. The location of the incident seemed to matter,
with worse odds for potentially severe head injuries in park
areas compared to groomed slopes (table 5).
DISCUSSION
The main finding of this study was that helmet use among
injured skiers and snowboarders has increased more than three-
fold from 2002 (23.8%) to 2011 (77.1%), but that the relative
reduction in the proportion of head injuries over the same
period was smaller than anticipated (from 17.6% to 15.4%).
Also, the results show that the helmet effect was attenuated over
the decade in question; the OR for head injury when the skier
or snowboarder wore a helmet was reduced by 55% in 2002
compared to only 21% and 20% in 2010 and 2011.
Recent decades have seen dramatic changes in alpine skiing
equipment, especially with the carving skis and twin-tip skis,
opening new possibilities for acrobatic skiing moves, possibly
with increased injury risk.15 The park areas have gone through
an extreme development over the past decade, high jumps and
other obstacles raising concerns about the potential for severe
injuries from high-impact crashes. Our data document an
increase in the number and proportion of injured persons in
park areas from 8% in 2002 to 21% and 25% in 2010 and
2011. In the same period, the proportion of expert and good
skiers has increased. Therefore, it is possible that an increased
number of skilled skiers performing more risky moves has led
to an increased injury risk in snow parks over the observed
decade.
The study shows that the likelihood of potentially severe head
injuries by location was greater in snow parks relative to other
areas, and does not appear to have changed much over the

 years. So, despite the trend for higher relative injury risks in
park areas, the risk of head injury cases compared to controls
over the actual period decreased. W
e observed a similar trend
with an increased proportion of injured alpine skiers, while the
proportion of alpine skiers with head injury was relatively stable
over the same period. In other words, park areas appear to have
become safer in terms of head injuries, while they are getting
less safe generally. This apparent disassociation may be the
result of the large increase in the proportion of helmeted skiers
and snowboarders. However, it should be noted that all these
changes are relative within the injured population. Further
studies are necessary to classify injury patterns in the parks, and
continuous preventive efforts are needed to limit injury severity.
More injured skiers and snowboarders classified themselves as
good or expert in 2010 and 2011 than in 2002. In our previous
study,3 we asked control skiers and snowboarders about risk-
taking behaviour, and compared it with helmet wear. W
e saw
that expert skiers and risk-takers were more likely to wear a
helmet. A study by Buller et al16 found that the highest propor-
tion with helmets was among expert skiers and snowboarders.
Ružić and T
udor17 also made similar observations, while others
have found no evidence of risk compensation among helmet
wearers.18 19 Mueller et al9 found a poor helmet correlation
among head-injured grown female skiers, indicating that hel-
meted skiers continue to take risks, while unhelmeted skiers
gradually ski less risky. If this were a factor in our study, it could
help explain the results, as it would lead to a higher injury rate
among helmet users and even the attenuated gender difference
in injury risk observed over the decade.
In our study, we observed a trend that severe head injuries
occurred more frequently in adult skiers and snowboarders. In
2010 and 2011, potentially severe head injuries occurred more
often among Norwegian and Swedish skiers than Danish skiers,
possibly because the latter are less skilled and ski more cau-
tiously. Thus, skiing ability also seems to be associated with risk
of potential severe head injuries, with the good and expert
skiers and snowboarders at highest risk.
W
e have conducted the study in the same skiing areas,
and the ski patrol registration system remains the same, as well
as the injury registration form used. Recall bias is not likely,
since the ski patrol made the injury interviews on the spot, typ-
ically only a few minutes after the injury occurred. Nevertheless,
except for skiing ability,20 we have not carried out any reliability
studies, so we do not know the degree of misclassification
errors. Although we do not know how a stressful injury situ-
ation may have affected how skiers reported their skiing ability
or skiing instruction, most other factors (including helmet
status) could be observed directly by the ski patrol.
Still, there are some issues that should be borne in mind
when interpreting the results of the current study. One limita-
tion is that we used skiers and snowboarders with other injuries
as controls, as was done in most previous studies to estimate the

 protective effect of cycling helmets,21 The assumption is that
whether a fall causes injury to the head or to another body part
is influenced by helmet status, and these injured groups can
therefore be compared to assess the protective effect of the
helmet. However, this estimate can be confounded by a number
of other factors. In our previous study,3 we therefore also
included an uninjured control group from the same skiing areas.
When we compared the results between the injured and the
uninjured control groups, the helmet effect was essentially the
same. This lends support to the current risk estimates reported.
Head injuries combined with other injuries were rare (2–3%
of cases), but as these could potentially bias the helmet effect
estimates, we also performed sensitivity analyses excluding these
cases. There was essentially no change in the risk estimates
reported (data not shown).
It would have been preferable to include data from all ski
seasons between 2002 through 2011. Unfortunately, data for
2003 through 2009 were not available.
Another issue is the helmet quality. W
e have not tested or
evaluated the helmets of the skiers or snowboarders in this
study. Nevertheless, all helmets rented out or sold in Norway
are CE-certified.
The large change in helmet use among injured people in
the slopes was age-related. We observed an increase in helmet
wear in our injured control group among skiers and snow-
boarders under the age of 13 from 70% to 96% over the
decade, compared to from 22% to 84% for age 13 to 20 and
from 15% to 66% for those over 20 years. We have adjusted
for ability and age in our regression analyses, but it may be
important to note that helmet wear was already high among
children.
Research methods to assess the effect of protective equipment
could be improved. Using exposure-adjusted injury rates would
be valuable. Better quality medical injury data are desirable.
This could be achieved by better medical education of ski
patrol, as well as better cooperation with local hospitals for
medical data exchange. Injury forms should be adapted to
capture new trends in skiing and snowboarding, as well as infor-
mation on new injury patterns. Hypotheses around behavioural
change and helmet impact performance represent potential
areas for future research. Capturing injury-free accidents could
also provide important information.
In conclusion, even if the reduction in the proportion of head
injuries was smaller than expected, there was a reduction. Also,
the results show that, although less pronounced than in 2002,
the risk of head injuries, at least of potentially severe head injur-
ies, was still reduced among helmet users in 2011. Therefore,
wearing a helmet should be strongly recommended.

 What are the findings?
This study demonstrated an attenuated association between
helmet use and risk of head injury among injured skiers and
snowboarders after a decade when the vast majority had begun
wearing helmets.
How might it impact on clinical practice in the future?
Clinicians as well as the skiing resorts and ski rentals should
inform skiers and snowboarders that current helmets have a
limited capacity to protect the head. Skiers and snowboarders
must remain aware of the risks of head injury associated with
the decisions they make while skiing, thus skiing according to
their capacity and skill as well as the piste challenges they
encounter.
