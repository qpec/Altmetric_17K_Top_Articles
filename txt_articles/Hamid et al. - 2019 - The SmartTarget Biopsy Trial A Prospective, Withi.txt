Abstract
Background: Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI)-targeted prostate biopsies can
improve detection of clinically significant prostate cancer and decrease the overdetection of
insignificant cancers. It is unknown whether visual-registration targeting is sufficient or augmenta-
tion with image-fusion software is needed.
Objective: To assess concordance between the two methods.
Design, setting, and participants: We conducted a blinded, within-person randomised, paired
validating clinical trial. From 2014 to 2016,141 men who had undergone a prior (positive or negative)
transrectal ultrasound biopsy and had a discrete lesion on mpMRI (score 3–5) requiring targeted
transperineal biopsy were enrolled at a UK academic hospital; 129 underwent both biopsy strategies
and completed the study.

Introduction
Current management strategies for prostate cancer (PC)
depend heavily on appropriate risk stratification, for which
adequate tumour sampling and localisation are pivotal. The
standard 12-core systematic transrectal ultrasound (TRUS)-
guided prostate biopsy has, however, led to overdiagnosis of
indolent cancers in some patients and undersampling in
others. Development of multiparametric magnetic reso-
nance imaging (mpMRI) has improved diagnostic sensitivi-
ty
for
clinically
significant
disease
while
reducing
overdetection of clinically insignificant cancer [1–3].
Several mpMRI-directed or targeted biopsy methods
have been established to improve risk stratification: in-bore
targeted biopsies, visual registration (also called cognitive
registration, mentally translating mpMRI targets onto real-
time ultrasound images), and software-based MRI/ultra-
sound image-fusion systems overlaying MRI targets onto
real-time ultrasound images [3]. None has yet established
superiority in a clinical setting. Whether visual-registration
targeting is sufficient or whether it needs augmentation
with image-fusion software has been debated [4]. Smart-
Target Biopsy trial (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02341677) was
conducted to compare visual registration with image fusion
using a validated [5] MRI/ultrasound fusion system devel-
oped in our institution (SmartTarget; technical details
included in the Supplementary material).
2.
Patients and methods
2.1.
Study design and participants
SmartTarget Biopsy was a prospective, blinded, within-person random-
ised, paired, validating clinical trial designed in accordance with the
IDEAL Collaboration recommendations for medical device evaluation
[6]. The study was approved by the London-Dulwich Research Ethics
Committee (REF 14/LO/0830) and conducted at University College
London Hospital (UCLH). Men with previous mpMRI and TRUS-guided
prostate biopsy with or without a PC diagnosis, referred to UCLH for
repeat biopsy for accurate diagnosis and further risk stratification, were
screened for the study. Eligibility criteria included a discrete lesion seen
on mpMRI with Likert scoring 3, 4, or 5, and no hormone therapy (except
5-alpha reductase inhibitors) within the last 6 mo, previous radiation
therapy to the pelvis, PC treatment, or evidence of metastatic or nodal
disease outside the prostate. Consecutive eligible patients who provided
written consent to the trial were enrolled. The trial was completed in
accordance with the protocol.
2.2.
Intervention and follow-up
Before enrolment in the study, all men underwent mpMRI as standard of
care in accordance with the British Society of Urogenital Radiology and
European Society of Urogenital Radiology standards [7–9] in sequences
as described in our previous studies [1]. These procedures were reported
in both written and pictorial form by an experienced uroradiologist with
access to clinical information. Each lesion was scored using a five-point
Likert system, which was our centre standard at the time of study start,
and has been shown to be valid and equivalent to Prostate Imaging
Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) version 1. Our study commenced
before PI-RADS version 2 [10,11].
Each enrolled patient underwent transperineal prostate biopsy
under local anaesthetic with the option of sedation and had up to
three biopsy samples, each taken using visual estimation and image
fusion. Only one lesion was biopsied (the lesion with the highest
Likert score, if more than one lesion was present). Biopsies were
directed to the target lesion via a 5-mm transperineal grid. Our ethics
committee permitted only three
needle deployments for each
strategy to comply with our prostate biopsy standard operating
procedure. Additional samples were collected as clinically indicated
but were not analysed for this study. For both biopsy strategies, the
grid coordinates were recorded for each needle deployed; each core
was potted individually in chronological sequence, and the sequence
was recorded.
A different surgeon performed each of the biopsy strategies. The
order of the two biopsy procedures was randomised 1:1 to minimise the
impact of any visible signs from the first biopsy on the second surgeon. To
minimise incorporation bias (bias based on the knowledge of the
comparator test results), the equipment was reset by loosening the
stepper/ultrasound jig between the two biopsy strategies, requiring the
Intervention: The order of performing biopsies using visual registration and a computer-assisted
MRI/ultrasound image-fusion system (SmartTarget) on each patient was randomised. The
equipment was reset between biopsy strategies to mitigate incorporation bias.
Outcome measurements and statistical analysis: The proportion of clinically significant prostate
cancer (primary outcome: Gleason pattern �3 + 4 = 7, maximum cancer core length �4 mm;
secondary outcome: Gleason pattern �4 + 3 = 7, maximum cancer core length �6 mm) detected
by each method was compared using McNemar's test of paired proportions.
Results and limitations: The two strategies combined detected 93 clinically significant prostate
cancers (72% of the cohort). Each strategy detected 80/93 (86%) of these cancers; each strategy
identified 13 cases missed by the other. Three patients experienced adverse events related to
biopsy (urinary retention, urinary tract infection, nausea, and vomiting). No difference in urinary
symptoms, erectile function, or quality of life between baseline and follow-up (median 10.5 wk)
was observed. The key limitations were lack of parallel-group randomisation and a limit on the
number of targeted cores.
Conclusions: Visual-registration and image-fusion targeting strategies combined had the highest
detection rate for clinically significant cancers. Targeted prostate biopsy should be performed
using both strategies together.
Patient summary: We compared two prostate cancer biopsy strategies: visual registration and
image fusion. A combination of the two strategies found the most clinically important cancers
and should be used together whenever targeted biopsy is being performed.

All
14 surgeons were trained in visual-registration targeted biopsy within
our longstanding, high-volume programme and on the SmartTarget
image-fusion software and platform. Surgeons had access to the images
before but not during the procedure. The only information on tumour
location during the biopsies was generated by the software for the
image-fusion biopsy strategy.
The surgeon performing each procedure was also randomised, based
on a binary clinical experience ranking to reduce the effect of experience
level as a confounder. The randomisation schedule was generated by the
study statistician and blocked in groups of four so that there was a
balance in allocation after every 20th patient. The randomisation
schedule was kept in the clinical trial unit, concealed from clinical staff at
all times. After a check of eligibility criteria, the randomised allocation
was provided by telephone and in writing immediately before the
procedure. Within-person randomisation (ie, comparison of the two
strategies performed on each patient) was used to enable evaluation of
the detection rate of each strategy and the effect of combining the two.
Biopsy samples were evaluated by a specialist uropathologist with
more than 15 yr of experience and classified according to our validated
system (Supplementary Table 1) [12]. Each patient completed estab-
lished, validated instruments for the detection of change in genitouri-
nary function, the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) and
International Index of Erectile Function—15 questions (IIEF-15) [13,14],
and the EuroQol—5 Domains—5 Levels (EQ-5D-5L) questionnaire before
the procedure, and at 1 and 6 wk after the procedure. Adverse events
(AEs) were recorded until 6 wk after the procedure, and serious AEs
(SAEs) were reported for 90 d after the procedure.
2.3.
Outcomes
The prespecified primary outcome was the proportion of men with UCL
definition 2 clinically significant disease [15] based on image-fusion
biopsy versus that based on visual registration. The primary outcome
was therefore Gleason pattern of �3 + 4 = 7 or cancer core length of
�4 mm in any core. The prespecified secondary outcome was the
proportion of men with UCL definition 1 clinically significant disease
detected by image-fusion biopsy versus visual-registration biopsy, that
is, Gleason pattern of �4 + 3 = 7 or cancer core length of �6 mm in any
core. Questionnaires and AEs were used to evaluate the quality of life and
safety related to performance of both targeting strategies.
2.4.
Statistical analysis
Our null hypothesis was that the accuracy of these two biopsy strategies
is equivalent, that is, all result pairs are either both positive (a) or both
negative (d). Discordant biopsy result pairs are represented by b (visual-
registration biopsy positive and image-fusion biopsy negative) or c
(visual-registration biopsy negative and image-fusion biopsy positive).
For the null hypothesis to be true, b/c = 1. To determine the required
study sample size, an estimate of the proportions of the discordant pairs
(b and c) was required. As the results of the two strategies are not
independent, a test of match-paired binary responses was selected for
the primary statistical analysis. For McNemar's test of paired proportions
using the Miettinen normal approximation with a two-sided significance
level of 0.05, a sample size of 80 achieves a power of at least 0.80 when
the discordant proportions are 0.05 and 0.20 of the total number.
If it is assumed that in 80% of men results from one of the methods
were classified as UCL definition 2 clinically significant cancer, then
either method would have to classify <65% of men as having UCL
definition 2 clinically significant cancer for there to be sufficient power to
detect a significant difference. Therefore, sample size was driven by the
number of men with clinically significant cancer present on visual-
registration targeted biopsies and not by the total number of men
biopsied. A preplanned evaluation of significant disease prevalence in
the first 50 patients biopsied as of 23 July 2016 determined that the
disease prevalence assumption was too high; only 26 (52%) had evidence
of clinically significant disease by visual-registration biopsy. Thus, the

 sample size was increased to at least 128 men with both biopsy

Results
Between 14 November 2014 and 23 September 2016,
341 patients were screened for the study, 141 were
enrolled, and 129 underwent both visual-registration and
image-fusion biopsies and were analysed for the primary
and secondary endpoints. Baseline and demographic
characteristics are shown in Table 1. The reasons for
randomisation without completion of both biopsies for
the other 12 men are provided in Figure 1.
UCL definition 2 PC was detected using both biopsy
strategies combined in 93/129 (72%) men (Table 2). Each
strategy detected 80/93 (86%; p = 1) of these significant
cancers with an overall detection rate of 80/129 (62%). Each
method identified 13 cancers that the other missed. The
combination of the two methods resulted in a 14% (13/93
cases) improvement in the detection of clinically significant
PC. Post hoc analysis of this difference showed it to be
statistically significant (95% confidence interval: 7.6–22.5).
UCL definition 1 PC was detected in 66/129 (51%) men. Of
these 66 men, 52 (79%) were identified by visual-registra-

 tion targeting and 48 (73%) by image-fusion targeting
(p = 0.5). Image fusion detected 14 definition 1 cancers that
visual-registration biopsies missed, and visual registration
detected 18 definition 1 cancers that image fusion missed. A
post hoc analysis in men with �Gleason 3 + 4 = 7 showed a
similar pattern. Visual registration detected 71/83 (86%) of
these cancers and image fusion 70/83 (84%) with an overall
detection rate of 83/129 (64%). The combination of the two
methods resulted in a 14% (12/83 cases) improvement in
this population. Biopsy characteristics are summarised in
Table 3. No differences in patient age, prostate-specific
antigen level, total cancer core length, or lesion volume
between the concordant and discordant cases was apparent
(Supplementary Table 2 and Supplementary Fig. 1–4). An
increase in cumulative cancer detection was seen for each
additional core taken (Table 4).
Safety findings after the two biopsy strategies were
consistent with the safety profile associated with either
strategy performed alone [12,16]. Three patients experi-
enced AEs related to the biopsy procedure: two patients
with events (urinary retention with catheterisation for 1 wk
and urinary tract infection) that were mild in severity, and
one patient with moderate nausea and vomiting. No SAEs
were reported. No statistically significant difference in
patient-reported outcome scores (IPSS, IIEF-15, and EQ-5D-
5L) was seen between baseline and follow-up (median
[interquartile
range]

Individual variation was seen in IIEF-15 scores (overall
and domain specific) and in health-related quality-of-life
scores measured by EQ-5D-5L (Supplementary Fig. 5–7).

Discussion
This study, which directly compared transperineal image-
fusion and visual-registration biopsy strategies, found no
statistically significant difference in overall detection rates
of clinically significant PC. Both strategies missed clinically
significant cancers detected by the other strategy and so
should be used in combination to optimise cancer detection.

 clinically significant PC using mpMRI targeting (of whatever
kind) compared with TRUS-guided biopsy continues to
grow [3,4,17,18]. The recent PRECISION randomised con-
trolled trial demonstrated the superiority of MRI-targeted
biopsies
over
systematic
biopsies
[19].
Omitting
the
systematic template biopsy and performing only targeted
biopsies may have maintained high diagnostic yield for
clinically significant cancer in this trial, and reduced patient
and healthcare resource burden. However, the optimal
method for targeting biopsies has yet to be defined.
The SmartTarget Biopsy study design had a number of
important strengths. First, the paired cohort design (both
strategies conducted in each patient) allowed both a
comparison of detection rates between them and an
evaluation of the benefits and risks of combining the two
strategies. To minimise potential incorporation bias sources,
we randomised the order of the two biopsy strategies for
each patient and reset the equipment to a default setting
before each biopsy strategy. A double-blind, parallel-group
clinical trial would provide confirmation of detection rate
similarity afforded for the two strategies, but a design that
also assessed the additive value might be more challenging.
Second, biopsy conducted by 14 urologists who were
considered experienced by our senior assessors in visual-
registration biopsy performance meant that the visual-
registration strategy was as optimised as possible, providing
a robust comparator to image fusion. However, this factor
might have provided a comparison level that may, in fact,
not represent performance of MRI-targeted biopsies else-
where by urologists with less experience. Last, the careful
prespecified
sample
size
calculation
and
subsequent
increase assured a sample size that minimised type II error,
that is, with sufficient power to detect a true difference in
PC detection rates between the two biopsy strategies.
Key limitation of this study included capping the biopsy
sample number to three per strategy, which may have
reduced detection rates for both visual registration and
image fusion. This limit may also potentially confound an
effect of increasing sample number with the apparent
additive effect of the two strategies—the increase in
detection rate for the combination of the two strategies.
A parallel-group trial, which could maximise the number of
needle deployments in an ethically acceptable fashion,
could further distinguish the role played by each factor.
Furthermore, evaluation of only transperineal biopsy may
have limited applicability to transrectal biopsy.
Although our study was conducted in a different
population and using different methods, our results are
consistent with those of others. Wegelin and colleagues [3]
published a systematic review comparing MRI in-bore
targeting with a targeted biopsy utilising both visual
registration and image fusion. They showed that each
method had similar overall cancer detection rates. Howev-
er, both MRI in bore and image fusion proved to be superior
to visual registration for clinically significant
cancer
detection, although the confidence that we can attribute
to the data was limited by the wide variability in detection
rates. Among comparative studies performed in expert
centres where skill-based biopsy strategies (visual regis-
tration) will be an optimal control, most reports suggest
that a biopsy using some form of image registration will
approximate expert performance [20,21]. Wysock et al. [21]
demonstrated some benefit associated with an image-
fusion system for anterior tumours, but that study was
conducted using a transrectal approach, which might have
made the sampling of these tumours that were furthest
away from
the
needle deployment
subject
to some
systematic error. In contrast, work by Lee and colleagues
[22] found that the sampling of transition zone lesions
(with the exception of basal lesions) yielded higher cancer
detection rates when image-fusion software was used. This
difference was attributed to limited registration contouring
to the base ordifficulty targeting the base on axial views. We
found no baseline or imaging parameter that might explain
the discordant cases in our study.
Cost is an important consideration but may vary widely
depending on both the capital cost of the system and patient
volume. A cost-benefit analysis is a complex question
beyond this study's scope. However, our results suggest
potential benefits of a faster learning curve and higher
repeatability that may enable less experienced centres to
increase throughput and achieve cancer detection rates
equivalent to those of highly experienced centres.
