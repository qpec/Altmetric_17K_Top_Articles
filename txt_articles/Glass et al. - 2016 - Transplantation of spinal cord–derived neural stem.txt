Transplantation of spinal cord–derived
neural stem cells for ALS
Analysis of phase 1 and 2 trials
ABSTRACT
Objective: To test the safety of spinal cord transplantation of human stem cells in patients with
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) with escalating doses and expansion of the trial to multiple
clinical centers.
Methods: This open-label trial included 15 participants at 3 academic centers divided into 5 treat-
ment groups receiving increasing doses of stem cells by increasing numbers of cells/injection and
increasing numbers of injections. All participants received bilateral injections into the cervical spi-
nal cord (C3-C5). The final group received injections into both the lumbar (L2-L4) and cervical cord
through 2 separate surgical procedures. Participants were assessed for adverse events and pro-
gression of disease, as measured by the ALS Functional Rating Scale–Revised, forced vital
capacity, and quantitative measures of strength. Statistical analysis focused on the slopes of
decline of these phase 2 trial participants alone or in combination with the phase 1 participants
(previously reported), comparing these groups to 3 separate historical control groups.
Results: Adverse events were mostly related to transient pain associated with surgery and to side
effects of immunosuppressant medications. There was one incident of acute postoperative dete-
rioration in neurologic function and another incident of a central pain syndrome. We could not dis-
cern differences in surgical outcomes between surgeons. Comparisons of the slopes of decline
with the 3 separate historical control groups showed no differences in mean rates of progression.
Conclusions: Intraspinal transplantation of human spinal cord–derived neural stem cells can be
safely accomplished at high doses, including successive lumbar and cervical procedures. The
procedure can be expanded safely to multiple surgical centers.
Classification of evidence: This study provides Class IV evidence that for patients with ALS, spinal
cord transplantation of human stem cells can be safely accomplished and does not accelerate the
progression of the disease. This study lacks the precision to exclude important benefit or safety
issues. Neurology® 2016;87:392–400

There are few disease-modifying therapeutic options for people with amyotrophic lateral sclero-
sis (ALS). Supportive preclinical data in ALS rodents show that transplantation of human spinal
cord–derived neural stem cells (HSSCs) into the ventral horn of the spinal cord delays the onset
of ALS and improves animal survival.1–4 We embarked on a program in humans to test whether
injection of HSSCs directly into the lumbar and cervical segments of the spinal cord is safe, with
the ultimate goal of testing in future studies whether this approach can slow or stop disease
progression. The results of our phase 1 trial have been reported,5,6 and we now have completed
a phase 2, dose-escalation study in 15 additional participants. The focus of this trial was 3-fold:

 (1) test the safety and tolerability of delivering
increasing numbers of cells by both increasing
the concentration cells in each injection
and increasing the number of injections
into the spinal cord; (2) extend the program
from a single-center, single-surgeon study, to
a 3-center, 3-surgeon study; and (3) evaluate
which outcome measures optimally measure
stem cell efficacy. The expansion of the trial
to 2 additional centers anticipates the need to
test whether this highly invasive surgical inter-
vention can be safely performed outside our
one center. This will be necessary for a sizable
therapeutic efficacy trial as well as to provide
this treatment to a large number of patients
should it prove successful in ameliorating the
course of disease; it will also be used to provide
preliminary estimates for planning future effi-
cacy trials.
METHODS Standard protocol approvals, registrations,
and patient consents. The study protocol was approved by the
US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and institutional
review boards from each center approved the study protocols.
All patients signed informed consent documents stating clearly
the risks of participating in the study, that the trial was designed
to test the safety of the treatment, and that there was no
expectation of clinical benefit. The trial was registered in
ClinicalTrials.gov as NCT 01730716.
The phase 1 patients were all treated at Emory University, and
the initial results of that trial are published.5,6 The 3 participating
centers for phase 2 were Emory University, Atlanta (7 participants),
University of Michigan, Ann Arbor (6 participants), and the Mas-
sachusetts General Hospital, Boston (2 participants). The detailed
inclusion criteria are presented in table e-1 on the Neurology® Web
site at Neurology.org. Briefly, participants with ALS had to be
within 24 months of symptom onset at the time of the screening
visit and had to undergo surgery not more than 36 months after
symptom onset. All participants were ambulatory with some
extremity weakness but not less than antigravity strength, with
a seated forced vital capacity (FVC) of $60% of normal predicted
values. Weakness of neck extensor muscles was exclusionary to avoid
the possibility of neck instability after multilevel laminectomies.
Participants were recruited into 5 successive groups of increas-
ing doses, with 3 participants in each group. The demographic
characteristics and baseline clinical measures for the 15 phase-2 par-
ticipants plus the 9 phase-1 participants are presented in table 1.
The numbers of injections ranged from 10 to 40, and the numbers
of cells injected ranged from 2 million to 16 million. The specifics
for the doses of each group are presented in table 2.
As an early-phase trial, the primary research questions were
focused on the safety of transplanting increasing doses of HSSCs
into the spinal cords of people with ALS, and the ability to
expand this procedure to multiple institutions. There was no con-
temporaneous control group and the study was not powered to
show therapeutic efficacy, and thus meets Class IV evidence.
Surgical procedure. The surgical transplantation procedure,
including the design of the injection platform, was developed
by one of the participating surgeons (N.M.B.).7 Two surgeons
(P.P. and L.B.) were trained by N.M.B., first by performing
a series of transplantation procedures on minipigs,8 assuring that
the pigs recovered to their preoperative baseline, and then by
observation of N.M.B. performing the procedure on a person
with ALS. N.M.B. also traveled to each site to serve as a reference
during the first surgery done by each of the other surgeons.
The details of the surgical procedure are published9,10 (includ-
ing video of the procedure). Each injection contained the pre-
scribed dose of the cell suspension in a 10-mL volume. Group A
received 5 injections on each side of the cervical cord, and groups
B through D received 10 injections on each side. Group E under-
went 2 procedures about 1 month apart, first with 10 injections
on each side of the lumbar cord and then 10 on each side of the
cervical cord. All injections were spaced 4 mm apart.
As reported for the phase 1 study,5,6 participants received an
immunosuppression regimen of basiliximab (1 dose during sur-
gery, second dose on postoperative day [POD] 3 or 4), predni-
sone for 1 month following surgery, and tacrolimus and
mycophenolate mofetil continued as long as tolerated.
Assessment of safety. Participants are followed postoperatively
at 2 and 4 weeks, and then at months 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, and
24 and then at every 6 months thereafter until death. Participants
are evaluated for adverse events (AEs), clinical laboratory tests,
and physical examination. This report includes data on all pa-
tients up to 9 months. Close attention was given to changes in
neurologic function, including new, or acceleration of, weakness
and respiratory compromise as documented by the neurologic
examination and serial measures of the ALS Functional Rating
Scale–Revised (ALSFRS-R),11 FVC, and grip strength. MRI
focusing on the surgical site was done in the immediate post-
operative period and at months 1, 6, and 12 after surgery. Safety
endpoints also included complications associated with immuno-
suppressive therapy. All AEs were reported to the Data Safety and
Monitoring Board (DSMB) who adjudicated all AEs in compli-
ance with FDA “Guidance for Clinical Trial Sponsors” (OMB
control number 0910-0581). Trial continuation and progression
to successive cohorts was the decision of the DSMB.
Identification of control groups. These were open-label trials
and consequently we were unable to compare outcomes directly
with a randomized comparison group. Thus, we decided to
further address the question of safety by generating separate
comparison groups from the dataset available from the placebo
arm of the completed trial of ceftriaxone in ALS12 (provided by
the NEALS consortium) and from the ProACT dataset,13 which
contains the data from control arms of multiple completed ALS
trials. In addition, we searched the Emory ALS Center database
for patients matching the clinical characteristics of each of the
participants in the phase 1 and phase 2 trials, controlling as closely
as possible for age at onset of symptoms, sex, and time from onset
to “intervention,” which for trial participants was the date of
surgery and for database patients the date of first clinical
measurements. We excluded the first 6 participants from the
phase 1 trial because they were particularly advanced in their
disease (3 were maintained on mechanical ventilators), making
them obvious outliers.5 The analysis included the remaining 9
participants from phase 1 and all 15 participants in phase 2.
Analyses included comparisons to controls regarding slopes of
decline over the first 9 months for ALSFRS-R, FVC %
predicted, and grip strength (available only for the ceftriaxone
dataset) with either all 24 participants (phases 1 and 2), or with
only the 15 phase 2 participants.
Statistical analysis. We performed longitudinal analysis of the
outcomes by comparing mean slopes of the trial participants to

 each control group using linear mixed models analysis of vari-
ance.14 Briefly, for each outcome, we modeled response as a linear
function of time, with terms to allow testing for equal y-intercepts
and equal slopes for control and trial participants. For each
patient, time is the days since (first) surgery. Detailed statistical
methods are presented in the supplemental material.
In addition to the formal linear mixed models analysis, we
conducted an exploratory analysis of the estimated slopes. We

 obtained 95% confidence limit estimates for the means of the
slopes for the various control groups. We then estimated the slope
of decline for each outcome for each participant and classified
these slopes in relation to the confidence limit estimates as below
the lower limit, between the lower and upper limits, or above the
upper limit.
RESULTS AEs occurring in phase 1 are reported in
our 2 previous publications.5,6 Table 3 summarizes
the AEs occurring in phase 2, including the possible
relationship to surgery, the surgical device, the stem
cells, and immunosuppressive drugs as determined
by the site investigator. There were 2 participant
deaths in the phase 2 trial before 270 days that were
attributed to disease progression. Thirty-day surgical
outcomes revealed no wound dehiscence, wound
infections, CSF leaks, meningitis, or hematoma
formations. Of 165 reported AEs, 14 were thought
possibly or probably related to the stem cells, and
none were considered definitely related to the stem
cells. The majority of AEs were related to surgery,
including incisional pain and transient paresthesias,
with the second most common events related to the
immunosuppressive medications. Two participants
stopped tacrolimus and mycophenolate for the
problems of headache (1) and diarrhea (1). Two
other participants stopped only tacrolimus because
of new-onset diabetes mellitus, a known toxicity of
tacrolimus. One patient was treated for duodenitis.
Two participants experienced pulmonary embolism,
which is an uncommon but known risk in patients
with ALS as well as in patients undergoing spine
surgery.15,16 The relative numbers of AEs and
serious AEs did not differ significantly between sites
(table 3), although the relatively few events that did
occur makes quantitative comparisons difficult.
Overall, the majority of participants had unevent-
ful surgical courses and were discharged from hospital
by POD 4. However, severe complications related to
trial participation were experienced by 2 participants,
and require special mention here. Participant 312 was
in cohort D and received 10 bilateral cervical injec-
tions with 400,000 cells/injection. Surgery was
deemed “uncomplicated,” but myoclonus in the
lower extremities was noted in the immediate post-
operative period. On POD 2, he had reduced sensa-
tion to pinprick below the neck, severe neck pain,
a burning sensation in both arms, and episodes of
myoclonus in both legs. Dexamethasone ameliorated
the myoclonus and reduced the pain, which was con-
trolled with morphine, although the loss of sensation
persisted. On POD 6, he was noted to have signifi-
cant loss of strength in bilateral lower extremities;
cervical MRI scan showed spinal cord edema. He
was treated with dexamethasone and on POD 7
underwent a C6 laminectomy and dural graft to
relieve external pressure on the cord. Following this
second surgery, there was some reduction of pain,
although the sensory and motor abnormalities did
not resolve. He was transferred to a rehabilitation
facility on POD 22. As compared to his preoperative
neurologic function, there was partial loss of sensation
below the neck with persistent burning pain in the
arms, partial loss of bowel and bladder control, and he
was unable to walk independently. He spent 75 days
in the rehabilitation hospital, at which time he could
support his weight and assist with transfers, and
bowel and bladder dysfunction had resolved. He con-
tinued to improve, and 5 months after surgery, he
could walk about 120 yards with a walker, but he
continued to report moderate neck pain treated with
analgesics and physical therapy.
It was clear that the neurologic deterioration was
due to the acute spinal cord swelling, but investigations
into the cause of the swelling were inconclusive. There
was no evidence of infection, and immunologic studies
did not show markers of rejection of the transplanted
cells. Review of the intraoperative videos by the 2 other
participating surgeons identified some variations in the
surgical procedure but it was not clear that these were
responsible for the adverse outcome. There was also
speculation that the presence of premorbid spinal ste-
nosis might have rendered the cord more vulnerable
to compressive injury during the injection procedure.
Participant 315 was in cohort E and underwent
lumbar and then cervical procedures with 10 bilateral
injections of 400,000 cells/injection. Of note is that
this participant had a history of “transverse myelitis”
diagnosed 25 years previously with full neurologic
recovery, and also a diagnosis of ulcerative colitis treated
with immunosuppressant agents. The surgical proce-
dures were accomplished without apparent complica-
tions. Following the lumbar surgery, there was mild
neuropathic pain in the left thigh that resolved without
specific treatment by POD 12. Cervical surgery
occurred 6 weeks after the lumbar surgery. The neuro-
pathic thigh pain returned approximately 2 months
after the cervical surgery. Five months after cervical
surgery, there was onset of neuropathic pain in both
forearms. The pain was assessed as “severe” and did not
respond to physical therapy or oral analgesics. Exami-
nation showed allodynia in the left thigh and the
patient reported “shooting pains” that began in the
thumb and traveled up the arm, occurring “hundreds
of times a day.” There were no motor deficits other
than those associated with his ALS. Femoral and radial
nerve blocks did not relieve the pain and it was con-
cluded that the pain was spinal in origin. The partici-
pant continues to be followed in a pain clinic and
requires narcotics to control his pain.
Imaging of the surgical regions and CSF studies did
not show evidence of swelling or inflammation, and
the cause of the neuropathic pain remains unknown.

 There is speculation that his history of autoimmune
disorders (transverse myelitis and ulcerative colitis)
may have predisposed him to an inflammatory reaction
within the spinal cord. Another possibility, supported
by the delay in onset of symptoms after transplanta-
tion, is the proliferation of the transplanted cells, caus-
ing irritation of the spinothalamic tracts.
Analysis of outcomes. The primary outcome measure
for the phase 2 trial was safety, which is addressed
in the discussion of AEs above. In addition, we ana-
lyzed outcome measures to generate estimates of

 slopes of decline as markers of disease progression.
Since we did not include a control group in this trial,
we compared these slopes of decline to those from 3
historical control groups (see the methods section). It
is important to note that, compared to the trial group,
the ceftriaxone and ProACT control groups were old-
er and had longer disease duration at entry (table 4).
The Emory controls were, by design, matched to the
trial participants in this regard. Also note that this trial
was neither designed nor powered to assess efficacy,
so these statistical comparisons were done as an indi-
cation of safety.
Linear mixed models analysis showed no differences
between either the combined phase 1 and 2 (n 5 24) or
the phase 2 only group (n 5 15) vs the 3 control groups
when looking at slopes of progression for ALSFRS-R,
FVC % predicted, and grip strength out to 270 days
postsurgery. Thus, the disease progression of trial pa-
tients as a group was no worse than that in the control
groups, further supporting our conclusion that intra-
spinal HSSC transplantation is safe. An example of the
analysis is provided in table 5, where the trial groups are
compared to the ceftriaxone placebo dataset at 270 days
after intervention. Data tables that include comparisons
of the trial groups to the other control groups at 270
days postintervention are included in tables e-2 to e-4.
Not unexpectedly, there was significant variability
among the participants in the slopes of decline for
each of the measures of progression. This variability
is demonstrated graphically in the figure, which,
assuming linearity, shows the slopes for each patient
as well as the mean slope for the entire group. Thus,
to investigate whether individual participants, rather
than all participants pooled as a single group, may
have responded differently to the intervention, we
calculated confidence limits around the slopes of
decline recorded from the 3 control datasets, and
asked, patient by patient, whether the slope of decline
fell below, within, or above the confidence limits of
the control groups. The confidence limits for mean
slopes of decline for the control datasets are shown in
table e-5, and the categorization of participants
as compared to the control datasets is shown in
table e-6. In general, for each of the outcome meas-
ures, there were more participants who fell either
within or above the upper confidence limit than
below the lower confidence limit, supporting the con-
clusion that the course of disease was not negatively
affected by the intervention.
DISCUSSION We completed 2 open-label trials
testing the safety of intraspinal transplantation of
spinal cord–derived neural stem cells in 30 people
with ALS. Our phase 1 data5,6 demonstrated the
safety of transplanting a single concentration of
HSSCs per injection. The phase 2 trial tested the
safety of escalating doses of stem cells delivered in
a combination of increasing numbers of cells per
injection, numbers of injections, and numbers of
procedures. The number of surgical centers was also
successfully expanded from a single center to 3,
showing that HSSC transplantation will be feasible
outside of a single institution for future clinical trial
purposes and for widespread application if it is found
to be efficacious. This report focuses on the safety
and tolerability of these added variables. In addition,
in a further effort to evaluate safety, we analyzed
measures

participants, 9 from phase 1 and all 15 from phase 2,
comparing their slopes of decline to historical datasets.
Of the 18 procedures performed in 15 participants
in phase 2, there were 2 patients who incurred life-
altering complications from the treatment—one with
postoperative spinal cord swelling that caused pain,
sensory loss, and paraparesis, and a second who devel-
oped a delayed-onset central pain syndrome requiring

 ongoing interventions for pain management. The
cause or causes of these complications are debatable,
with surgical trauma and inflammatory reaction to
the transplanted cells remaining possibilities. Both
of these patients received the highest dose of cells into
the cervical cord (20 injections, 400,000 cells/injec-
tion), which suggests caution for the choice of dosing
for the next phase of the trial. However, 4 other
patients received this same dose of cells without
apparent
complications,
and 10
other patients
received 20 cervical injections with various concen-
trations of cells without complications. The 3 patients
in cohort E tolerated successive procedures, although
the patient with chronic pain was in this group.
In the development of a new therapeutic interven-
tion, safety is defined relative to the severity of the dis-
ease. The level of acceptable risk for treating patients
with ALS, whereby the prognosis is poor and disease-
modifying interventions are limited, is arguably high-
er than that for more benign disorders. Here, we have
shown that, with a few exceptions, patients with ALS
can tolerate up to 20 injections with 400,000 cells per
injection into the lumbar and cervical spinal cord,
including 2 successive procedures totaling 40 injec-
tions and 16 million cells. Thus, we conclude that
the injection procedure, as well as the introduction
of high doses of HSSCs into the spinal cord, is rela-
tively safe. Certainly, we base these conclusions on
the limited number of participants treated in each
group. In addition, we succeeded in moving this com-
plex procedure from a single surgical center to 3 cen-
ters, demonstrating that this therapeutic approach is
amenable to scaling up for the treatment of larger
numbers of participants in a multicenter trial of
efficacy.
Our statistical analysis focused on comparing the
trial participants with observational datasets selected
from the placebo arms of previous ALS clinical trials
and from the large patient database housed at Emory
University. The ceftriaxone and ProACT datasets
were used because they represent previous ALS trial
populations and are publically available. The Emory
dataset was generated by matching individual trial
participants with patients with similar disease courses
based on disease duration, sex, and age at onset of
symptoms, which created a “control” group likely
more comparable to the trial group, although cer-
tainly more limited in numbers than the other com-
parison groups. Slopes of progression for ALSFRS-R,
FVC % predicted, and grip strength did not differ

 between the trial participants and any of the control
groups. This was true whether combining the phase 1
and 2 participants, or analyzing the phase 2 participants
alone. From the standpoint of safety, this is a positive
outcome since it was our overriding goal to assess
whether surgical implantation of HSSCs accelerates
disease progression or is otherwise harmful to ALS par-
ticipants. We acknowledge, however, the limitations of
using any historical control group in assessing either
safety or efficacy given the lack of contemporaneous
matching and variations in clinical care that may lead
to changes in the natural history of disease.17,18 This is
particularly relevant when studying a disease with such
a variable course of progression.
Another approach for evaluating safety would
include comparing slopes of progression presurgery
to those postsurgery. However, this study was not de-
signed to test efficacy and we had too few data points
for each patient to establish an effective lead-in slope
with which to compare the postsurgery slope.
It is difficult to assess efficacy in such a small treat-
ment trial, especially one with no randomized placebo
or observational comparison group.18 In addition,
each treatment cohort included only 3 participants,
further limiting our ability to make any conclusive
statements about therapeutic efficacy.19 The clinical
progression in ALS is highly variable, and the biolog-
ical
factors
accounting
for
this
variability
are
unknown. Thus, we must be cautious about ascribing
cause and effect for differences in disease course
between individual participants. We addressed indi-
vidual variability by calculating confidence limits
around the slopes of decline for the patients in the
historical datasets. The finding that the slopes of
decline for our patients were similar to those from
the historical control groups is a further indication
that this procedure does not negatively affect the
course of disease.
This study was not designed, nor was it large
enough, to determine efficacy of slowing or stopping
the progression of ALS. The design of such an efficacy
trial will be a challenge given the ethics surrounding
the inclusion of a true placebo group: participants
receiving injections into the spinal cord with saline
only. Alternatives include a blinded surgical control
group that is not exposed to cord penetration, or
a randomization scheme that includes a concurrent
untreated observational group. Another approach
could be to use individual participants as their own
controls, comparing the slopes of decline before and
after treatment. For this model, the choice of partic-
ipants would be predicated largely on the presence
of a moderate slope of decline measured during
a 3- to 6-month lead-in period, with both rapid and
slow progressors eliminated, allowing the use of pre-
dictive models to test whether a slope of decline has
been positively affected by the treatment. Such pre-
dictive models have already been developed20 and
are certain to be used to design and power future
ALS therapeutic trials.
