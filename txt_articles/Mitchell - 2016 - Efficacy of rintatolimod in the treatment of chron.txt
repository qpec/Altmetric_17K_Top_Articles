 DRUG PROFILE
Efficacy of rintatolimod in the treatment of chronic fatigue syndrome/myalgic
encephalomyelitis (CFS/ME)

ABSTRACT
Chronic fatigue syndrome/ Myalgic encephalomyelitis (CFS/ME) is a poorly understood seriously debil-
itating disorder in which disabling fatigue is an universal symptom in combination with a variety of
variable symptoms. The only drug in advanced clinical development is rintatolimod, a mismatched
double stranded polymer of RNA (dsRNA). Rintatolimod is a restricted Toll-Like Receptor 3 (TLR3)
agonist lacking activation of other primary cellular inducers of innate immunity (e.g.- cytosolic heli-
cases). Rintatolimod also activates interferon induced proteins that require dsRNA for activity (e.g.- 2ʹ-5ʹ
adenylate synthetase, protein kinase R). Rintatolimod has achieved statistically significant improve-
ments in primary endpoints in Phase II and Phase III double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled
clinical trials with a generally well tolerated safety profile and supported by open-label trials in the
United States and Europe. The chemistry, mechanism of action, clinical trial data, and current regulatory
status of rintatolimod for CFS/ME including current evidence for etiology of the syndrome are reviewed.

Introduction
Chronic fatigue syndrome/Myalgic encephalomyelitis (CFS/ME)
is a seriously debilitating disorder in which disabling fatigue is a
universal symptom in combination with a variety of variable
symptoms that include sleep disorders, cognitive defects, joint/
muscle pain, and headaches [1]. The fatigue is not improved by
bed rest and may be worsened by physical activity. CFS/ME is
an economically devastating illness whose societal costs to the
U.S. economy are conservatively estimated at more than $20B
yearly [2]. Heart failure, cancer, and suicide are the most com-
mon causes of death (59.6%) in patients with CFS/ME memor-
ialized by the National CFIDS Foundation [3]. The mean age of
death from cancer was 47.8 years and suicide was 39.3 years,
which is significantly younger than the general population.
Although limited by the informal collection of data, the analysis
remains the most comprehensive to date and suggests a sig-
nificantly increased risk of early death. The etiologic/pathogenic
basis for CFS/ ME is unknown and may be multifactoral with a
variety of microbes, hormonal, and immunological abnormal-
ities linked to its pathogenesis [4–6]. Moreover, CFS/ME may
have a familial component [7] and be dependent on genetic
signatures [8–10]. Recently discovered time-dependent plasma
immune signatures indicate a dynamic and evolving pathogen-
esis [11]. With no approved drug therapy available, treatment is
aimed at symptom relief and improved ambulatory function
[12]. These include over-the-counter and off-label prescription
drugs, behavioral modifications, and graded exercise therapies.
The rationale for the initial open-label trials with rintatoli-
mod in CFS/ME was based on its recognized broad antiviral
and immunomodulatory properties as an inducer of interferon
(IFN) [13]. These properties now are known to be mediated by
its activity as a dsRNA toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) agonist [14] in
the induction of innate immunity and the initial cellular
orchestration
for
the
progression
to
adaptive
immune
responses, which are mediated in part by inflammatory che-
mokines and cytokines [15]. TLR3 is abundant in functional
dendritic cells (DCs), central in the host adaptive immune
response system [16]. All of the TLRs use a MyD88-dependent
signaling pathway with the exception of TLR3 that uses the
MyD88 independent TRIF pathway [17]. Two other dsRNA-
activated inducers of gene expression that initiate innate
immune responses are the cytosolic helicases mda5 and RIG-
1. Rintatolimod, however, does not activate these helicases
[18,19]. The selectivity of rintatolimod for TLR3 without heli-
case activation preserves the non-MyD88 TRIF pathway with
its reduction in inflammatory cytokine induction observed
with the MyD88/MAV pathways and is responsible at least in
part for its improved safety record in clinical trials, compared
to other forms of dsRNA that cause helicase activation [20].
The initial success of open-label trials provided the basis for
the double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase II and Phase III
clinical trials as well as its FDA designation as an Orphan
Drug and a FDA-authorized treatment protocol.
Overview of the CFS/ME clinical landscape
Public awareness of CFS/ME was initially trivialized from
media coverage as ‘Yuppie Flu’ with an epicenter in Lake
Tahoe, California, in the mid-1980s [21]. CFS/ME is recognized
by the Federal government (CDC/FDA/NIH) as a disease

 syndrome that may be severely debilitating. Clinical trials are
difficult to conduct due to spontaneous remissions although
remissions become less frequent with increasing time from
initial symptom onset. There have been several attempts by
big
pharma
to
introduce
new
pharmaceutical
entities
although none have been successful to date. Despite efforts
to stimulate drug discovery for CFS/ME by the FDA [22], there
appear to be no pending programs.
The majority of CFS/ME patients experience a sudden onset
of symptoms, which many can identify as a specific date of
acute onset [23,24]. The distinction of acute versus slow onset
may represent a key element of differential pathogenesis,
which has not been explored adequately. The signs and symp-
toms of acute onset are suggestive of an infectious basis in
which some patients experience a prolonged extension of
symptoms with profound fatigue as the unifying element.
Introduction to the drug
Rintatolimod is a dsRNA that functions as an activating ligand
for TLR3 (Figure 1(a)). Unlike other dsRNAs, the activity of
rintatolimod is limited to TLR3 with no induction of the
cytosolic helicases (Figure1(b)) [18,19]. The importance of this
unique property of rintatolimod is a reduction of inflammatory
cytokines that has limited the clinical utility of other TLR-
activating ligands that use the inflammatory cytokine inducing
MyD88-dependent pathway of intracellular signaling [20].
Chemistry
Rintatoloimod is comprised of a single polypurine (inosine)
strand hydrogen-bonded with a single polypyrimidine strand
(cytosine) containing an inosine H-bond mismatched pyrimi-
dine (uridine) for every 12 cytosines. These are assembled into
a double-stranded RNA structure (Poly I: Poly C12U) that is
maintained
under
physiological
conditions
by
typical
‘Watson–Crick’ hydrogen bonding between purine and pyri-
midine base pairs. The introduction of the pyrimidine base
uridine at a 1:12 ratio (U:C) into the polypyrimidine strand
maintains the overall double-stranded structure, but creates
sites of thermodynamic instability (Figure 2) that allow rapid
hydrolysis of Poly I: Poly C12U by serum nucleases to simple
nucleosides compared to the parent Poly I: Poly C. Table 1
provides the specifications, for clinical grade rintatolimod,

transduction initiated by TRIF binding to the TIR of the TLR3 homodimer. TLR3 monomers dimerize with binding of the dsRNA ligand. Activated TRIF initiates two pathways.
The first results in the transitory induction of the IFNs. The second is a species variable pathway (rodents ≫primates) that operates though NFκB (dashed line), which
transiently induces the production of inflammatory cytokines. The adapter protein cascade initiated by TRIF (TIR-domain-containing adapter-inducing interferon) includes
TBK1 (TANK-binding kinase 1 binds to TRAF3), TRAF1/3 (TNF receptor associated factors), NAP1 (Nck-associated protein 1), IKK (IκB kinase), IKKε (inhibitor of IκB kinase),
P13K (Phosphoinositide 3-kinase), IRF3/7 (interferon regulatory transcription factors), TAK1 (protein kinase of MLK family), TAB1 (TGF-β activated kinase 1), RIP1 (Receptor-
interacting [TNFRSF] kinase 1), NFκB (nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells), IκB (inhibitor NFkB). The ectodomain of TLR3 consists of a horseshoe
shaped structure populated by 23 leucine-rich β-sheets (orange disks) connected by non-ordered chains containing RNA binding residues. The transmembrane a-helices
(solid orange) connect the ectodomain to the cytoplasmic TIR domain (dark green). The phosphorylated TIR binds TRIF to initiate the adapter protein cascade. B.

other identifying names, and formulation. Rintatolimod for
clinical use is provided as a sterile liquid formulation of high
MW dsRNA polymer freely soluble under physiological condi-
tions with a shelf life of over 7 years at 2–8°C.
Pharmacokinetics
The pharmacokinetic analysis of rintatolimod was conducted
early in its clinical development under the auspices of a
National Institutes of Health grant (CA29545) awarded to
Hahnemann University. Extensive studies were conducted
on the pharmacokinetics of rintatolimod administered as an
intravenous infusion to human subjects Phase I/II clinical
trials (CFS/ME and non-CFS/ME patients) [25,26]. Limited
pharmacokinetic
analysis
was
conducted
in
animals.
Rintatolimod
extracted
from
blood
is
in
the
dsRNA
conformation and amenable to quantitation by a solution
hybridization technique using a radioactive probe under
chaotropic salt conditions which inhibit RNase degradation
while allowing molecular probe hybridization displacement
of the homologous RNA strand (>50 bp limit of detection).
Since a minimum of 40–50 nucleotides are required for bind-
ing to TLR3 [27,28], the half-life measured in this assay is also
the half-life for the ability of rintatolimod to induce innate
immune responses. The assay is linear over a range of
3–530 μg/ml and has been validated in a multi-day study
shown to be reproducible within 15% and to be 94% accu-
rate [25,26]. There were a total of 132 patient-visits for which
one or more of the derived pharmacokinetic parameters
were available for analysis from the intravenous administra-
tion of 200–700 mg of rintatolimod over an average 30 min-
ute infusion time (Figure 3). Immediate post-infusion analysis
of rintatolimod and its metabolites showed an average of
60 ± 27 percent of theoretical maximum indicating signifi-
cant degradation during the infusion period. First-order
decay kinetics of rintatolimod from blood as a function of
time is illustrated for infusion doses of 200 mg (Figure 3(a)),
400 mg (Figure 3(b)), and 700 mg (Figure 3(c)) and is con-
sistent with an open one-compartment model. Since the poly
(C12U)n strand is more rapidly hydrolyzed than the poly(I)n
strand, the functional biological blood half-life (i.e. dsRNA
40–50 bp) is similar to the physical half-life measured by
this probe hybridization method. The pharmacokinetic data
show that drug accumulation arising from prolonged chronic
treatment did not occur. Cmax and Cmax/Dose decreased

 with duration of treatment (non-CFS/ME) or remained con-
stant (CFS/ME). Total exposure, AUC, was unaffected by dura-
tion of treatment for both disease groupings. Elimination
half-life increased 60% with prolonged treatment time
(>12 weeks); nevertheless, carryover is not observed since
the longest half-life observed in any of the patients, 72 min-
utes, was still less than 1/50 of the shortest proposed dosing
interval (72–96 hours, or twice/week). Gender as a factor in
rintatolimod pharmacokinetics is unlikely to have any clini-
cally significant impact on the selection of doses for the
treatment of CFS/ME. Gender was detected as a statistically
significant factor for clearance, Cmax and Cmax/Dose in
selected populations. In none of the cases, however, were
the differences (25–30%) likely to be clinically significant
given the wide safety margin associated with the recom-
mended dosing in CFS/ME patients. Age was not found to
be a factor in the pharmacokinetics of rintatolimod. There
was insufficient diversity in race in the pharmacokinetically
evaluated population to permit the examination of the
impact of race as a factor.
Pharmacodynamics and mechanism of action
TLR3 is activated by dsRNA [14]. The Toll-Like Receptors (TLRs)
are a family of Class I transmembrane receptors (n = 10 in
humans) that bind to pathogen-associated molecular patterns
(PAMPs), which function as a first line of defense against micro-
bial pathogens by the induction of innate immunity [29]. The
PAMP for TLR3 is dsRNA detected in endosomes of antigen-
presenting cells and on the cell surface of selected cells includ-
ing endothelial cells and airway epithelium [30–32]. The expres-
sion pattern is consistent with sentinel activity for the detection
of replicating virus in the host organism. Cellular location of
TLR3 is modulated by UNC93B1 whose transcription is up regu-
lated by dsRNA and which promotes trafficking of differentially
glycosylated TLR3 to the plasma membrane [33]. Binding of
dsRNA to TLR3 allows dimerization of TLR3 monomers and
activation of a cytosolic phosphorylation that initiates a cascade
of molecular events initiating transient activation of hundreds
of genes [34]. Rintatolimod is restricted to TLR3 activation
[18,19]. In contrast, other dsRNA configurations such as poly I:
poly C activate the cytosolic helicases that utilize the pro-
inflammatory MyD88 pathway. In contrast, TLR3 is the only
TLR that exclusively uses a non-MyD88 pathway (TRIF) that
minimizes the expression of systemic cytokines [20]. Figure 4
is a molecular model that illustrates rintatolimod-driven TLR3
dimer formation by non-covalent bonding. Studies with the
dsRNA homopolymer, poly I:poly C, have demonstrated a posi-
tive allosteric affect dependent on the size of the dRNA [27] by
lateral clustering [35]. Although TLR3 is activated with a mini-
mum size of 40–50 bp [27,28], approximately 90 bp are required
for the maturation of dendritic cells to mature antigen-present-
ing cells [36]. The release minimum MW specifications for rinta-
tolimod take advantage of this allosteric property of TLR3 that
favors activity with higher MW dsRNAs [27,33].
Clinical efficacy
Of thirteen studies conducted with rintatolimod, nine were per-
formed in severely debilitated CFS/ME patients (KPS ≤60). Three of
these studies constitute the main studies of efficacy. Three were
double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled Phase II/III clinical
trials at multi-sites (AMP-502, AMP-502 T, and AMP-516). AMP-
502 T was a limited extension, which provided further efficacy and
safety information. AMP-516 had a crossover in which subjects
were initially randomized to active treatment or placebo followed
by the blinded cross-over phase (AMP-516 C). All subjects received
active treatment while remaining blinded to the initial treatment
assignment. Five additional open label studies (AMP-501, AMP-
504, AMP-509, AMP-511, and AMP-502E) measured safety and
various efficacy parameters as well as long-term effects. Taken
together, the entire database provides a consistent picture of
durable activity in this population of severely disabled subjects
and the accumulation of over 90,000 doses. More than 1200
patients have been enrolled in various rintatolimod studies in
which over 830 unique CFS/ME patients received active drug.
In order to maintain direct comparability between rintatoli-
mod clinical trials, only those subjects who met the inclusion
criteria utilizing the original 1988 criteria of the CDC [37] and
exceeding duration of the disease complex (1 year versus
6 months) were enrolled. Subjects enrolled in the Phase III
clinical trial AMP-516 met both the CDC 1988 diagnostic criteria
and the more relaxed 1994 CDC definition [38]. An international
consortium proposed in 2011 that Myalgic Encephalomyelitis

 was a preferable term for the syndrome complex and in addition
to the defining post-exertional exhaustion, diagnosis required
additional evidence of neurological, immune, and energy
impairments [39]. Although the Institute of Medicine has pro-
posed recently Systemic Exertion Intolerance Disease (SEID) as a
more descriptive name for CFS/ME [40], profound fatigue
remains as the core descriptor for all definitions. The rintatoli-
mod clinical trials focused on alleviation of that core symptom
and its effect on quality of life.
The majority of patients had long disease durations of 6–9 years
before enrollment that illustrates the chronicity of severe illness in
some patients and for whom rintatolimod was targeted. Those
patients randomized were representative of the severe disease
state (KPS ≤60) and there were no important subsets of adult
patients who were excluded. To date, no children have been
studied.
Clinical trials
A variety of test modalities have been used in assessing effi-
cacy in open label and randomized, double-blind, placebo-
controlled trials. They include Exercise Tolerance (ET) and
Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) as the primary modalities
in evaluation of alleviation of the profound fatigue that affects
activities of daily living. Other secondary test modalities
included the SCL-90-R Short Check List-90-Revised-Cognitive
Deficit Subscale, the Activities of Daily Living (ADL) index, the

test modalities can be found in supplemental data.
Open label trials [41,42]
There have been five open-label studies of rintatolimod in
CFS/ME, one of which is an on-going cost recovery study
authorized by the FDA. These studies are summarized in
Table 2. They provided guidance for the Phase II/III double-
blind placebo-controlled trials. AMP-511 is a continuing open
label treatment protocol that provides additional current
safety data for rintatolimod in humans. AMP-516C was a
cross-over trial at the conclusion of the placebo-controlled
AMP-516 Phase III clinical trial [43]. Although technically an

Phase II and Phase III trials
There have been three placebo-controlled clinical trials of
rintatolimod in CFS/ME. AMP-502 was a Phase II study and
AMP-516 was a Phase III study in which the primary endpoint
achieved statistical significance (p ≤ 0.05). AMP-502 T was a
small extension of AMP-502 under blinded conditions for dose
escalation evaluation purposes. The trials are summarized in
Table 3.
AMP-502 was a ninety-two patient, 24 week Phase II trial at
four independent U.S. sites [24]. Study requirements were: age
18–60, KPS 20–60, restrictions on females of child-bearing age,
and endurance levels verified by treadmill. The median KPS in
both the placebo (n = 47) and rintatolimod (n = 45) treatment
arms was 50 (‘requiring considerable assistance for daily care’)
and the average duration of CFS/ME symptoms was 6.1 (rinta-
tolimod) and 4.4 (placebo) years. General patient demo-

Table S1. Patients assigned to each treatment group were
well matched demographically and with respect to the
severity of their illness with the exception of gender. There
were no significant differences between treatment groups in
the incidence of CDC CFS-defining symptoms, in the degree of
patient debilitation as measured globally by means of KPS, or
in their ability to perform routine activities of daily living
measured by the Activities of Daily Living (ADL). The primary
endpoint was KPS. Secondary endpoints were exercise toler-
ance (ET), ADL, SCL-90-R neurocognitive functional status,
signs and symptoms, medications for CFS/ME, and hospitaliza-
tions or emergency room services.
A total of 84 of the 92 enrolled patients completed
24 weeks of treatment. Of the 8 dropouts, 3 of 4 placebo
patients discontinued the study because of CFS/ME symptom
intensification. The remaining 5 dropped out for non-medical
reasons. At 24 weeks, patients receiving rintatolimod had
statistically significantly greater improvements from baseline
compared to the placebo cohort for global performance and
perceived cognition (Table 4). The mean of the primary end-
point, KPS, was significantly improved (p < 0.001) as well as
the median (p = 0.023). Statistically significant increases in the
KPS score were observed in the rintatolimod-treated cohort
compared to the placebo group at weeks 16, 20, and 24. At

 Week 24, the distribution of changes in KPS between placebo
and rintatolimod cohorts showed 50% more responders in the
rintatolimod cohort. Disease progression as measured by KPS
was apparent in 6 of 47 (12.7%) in the placebo arm while 1 of
45 (2.2%) progressed in the treatment arm. Similar improve-
ments were observed in the secondary endpoints associated
with quality of life (cognition, ADL), exercise tolerance, and
exercise work (O2 utilization). The objective quantitative
improvement in the symptoms of CFS/ME observed with rin-
tatolimod were seen also in the use of medications to alleviate
CFS/ME symptoms. At the beginning of the study, patients
were instructed to minimize all medications but were then
allowed the use of prescription and over-the-counter drugs as
needed. During the last 4 weeks of the study, the rintatolimod
cohort used significantly fewer drugs to alleviate CFS/ME and
CNS symptoms as well as pain as compared to the initial
4 weeks of study (Table 5). Forty-two percent (n = 39) of the
patients had laboratory evidence of Herpes viral activation as
demonstrated by giant cells expressing vital antigens on peri-
pheral mononuclear cell (PBMC) culture. Sixty-nine percent
were antigen positive for HHV-6, 8% cytomegalovirus, 5%
herpes simplex, and 0% for Epstein-Barr virus. Expression of
HHV-6 was associated with a poorer mean KPS score (50 v. 58,
p < 0.02) although there were no differences in improvements
observed in the rintatolimod cohort. Hospital emergency
room admissions were dramatically improved in the rintatoli-
mod cohort [42]. Fourteen of ninety-two enrolled patients
were hospitalized or required Emergency Room services dur-
ing the study. Significantly (p < 0.005), placebo patients were
hospitalized or admitted to an emergency room for a total of
114 days compared to 7 rintatoloimod patients for a total
19 days (Table 6).
AMP-516 was a Phase III randomized, double-blind, placebo-
controlled, multi-site (n = 12) clinical study [43,44]. There were
a total of 234 well-matched (age, gender, CFS/ME duration,
and body weight) patients equally divided between the two
cohorts (n = 117) in a 40-week study in which 79% (n = 93)
and 86% (n = 101) of the rintatolimod and placebo cohorts,
respectively, completed the arduous clinical trial (40 weeks
with IV infusions of ~35–40 minutes, twice per week). ET
utilizing a modified Bruce treadmill protocol was the primary
endpoint. At Week 40, there was a net improvement of 21.3%
(p = 0.047) from baseline in the ITT rintatolimod cohort com-
pared to the ITT placebo cohort (Table 7A). Mean ITT intrapa-
tient cohort percent improvement of 36.5 % (p < 0.001) versus
15.2% placebo (p = 0.198) further supports a beneficial effect
of rintatolimod on ET. Net ET improvement of 24.6% from
baseline in the rintatolimod cohort was observed for the
smaller (n = 93) 40-week rintatolimod trial completion group
(p = 0.019) (Table 7B), and in those ITT patients without
significant rintatolimod dose reductions net improvement
was 28.0% at the end of the 40-week trial (p = 0.022)
(Table 7C). In agreement with the ITT analysis, both the trial
completion and those patients without significant lapses in
drug administration demonstrated intrapatient improvement
(p < 0.001) versus placebo (p > 0.24). Table 7D illustrates the
effect of baseline ET stratification (≤9 minutes vs. >9 minutes)
on ET performance at 40 weeks in the ITT population. Those
patients able to achieve a > 9 minute duration on the CFS/ME-
modified Bruce protocol at baseline and randomized to rinta-
tolimod (n = 60) demonstrated a statistically significant advan-
tage over placebo (n = 66) (p = 0.034) at 40 weeks although
the lack of statistical efficacy in the ≤9 minutes cohort may be
a lack of statistical power (n = 40 versus n = 60 between the
placebo and rintatolimod sub-cohorts, respectively).
The individual patient ET responses to rintatolimod com-
pared to placebo for the ITT population is captured in
Figure 5. Individual patient change in ET from baseline at
40 weeks is plotted from lowest to highest ET performance
[44]. There is a minimum of three different ET response
cohorts– a high response cohort, a minimal response cohort,
and a negative response cohort. In the high response cohort
(upper 40% on right side of the plot), there is a clear improve-
ment in ET in the rintatolimod cohort versus placebo. The
middle cohort represents minimal change between rintatoli-
mod and placebo. The negative response cohort (on the left
side of the plot) shows deterioration in ET performance in
both rintatolimod and placebo patients. Nevertheless, rintato-
limod appears to reduce deterioration in ET versus the pla-
cebo controls for the poorest modified treadmill responders at
baseline.
Additional post hoc evidence supporting the efficacy of
rintatolimod in CFS/ME was provided by an analysis of the
frequency distribution of percent improvement in ET from
baseline to Week 40 in the rintatolimod versus placebo
cohorts (Table 8A). The proportions of patients in the ITT
population with changes in ET from baseline to Week 40 of
at least 25% and of at least 50% were 1.7 and 1.9-fold
greater for patients randomized to rintatolimod than pla-
cebo, 39% versus 23% (p = 0.013) and 26% versus 14%
(p < 0.028), respectively. CFS/ME patients further segre-

 Impaired oxygen consumption, characteristic of chronically
debilitated patients with severe cardiac dysfunction is also
well documented in CFS/ME [45]. Decreased oxygen uptake
is also an index of physical dysfunction in terms of reduced
ambulatory skills, rapid onset of exertional dyspnea, and pro-
foundly debilitating fatigue. The maximal oxygen utilization
(VO2 max) in CFS/ME patients during exercise treadmill testing
can also be used as a criterion for determining the seriousness
of the disease and its evolution. The functional impairment of
the AMP-516 CFS/ME subset population (~1/2 of drug and
placebo cohorts) was determined by measuring maximal oxy-
gen consumption during ET testing (Table 9) [39]. Despite the
reduced statistical power for a subset analysis, rintatolimod
improved VO2 max by 5.5% (p = 0.05).
The original placebo cohort in a blinded cross-over Stage 2
of AMP-516 achieved a mean intra-patient percent improve-
ment in ET of 39% (p = 0.04) at 24 weeks, while the original
rintatolimod cohort maintained their improvement in ET
(Table 7E).
Similar improvements were observed in the AMP-516
study secondary endpoints. Decrease in drug use was
observed in both the ITT and study completion patients
taking CFS/ME palliative drugs (p = 0.015 and p = 0.01,
respectively). KPS, ADL, and SF-36 vitality scores were signifi-
cantly improved from baseline (p < 0.01) in the rintatolimod
cohort.
Correlation of clinical trial efficacy data
A total of 331 patients were evaluated and randomly
assigned to either the placebo (n = 164) or rintatolimod
(n = 162) cohorts in two primary efficacy trials. Both the
Phase II and Phase III double-blind, placebo-controlled
trials achieved statistical significance of their primary end-
points, both physical performance based, KPS and ET,
respectively. Both studies showed significant improvement
in the primary symptom of CFS/ME, fatigue. Alleviation of
profound fatigue was achieved as evidenced by significant
improvement
in
ET
or
KPS
in
each
controlled
trial.
Supportive evidence for improvement in the quality of
life for the rintatolimod cohorts were reduced use of med-
ications in an effort by patients to reduce the debilitating
symptoms of CFS/ME and reduced hospital/emergency
room admissions as well as SF-36 vitality and ADL score
improvements. Perceived cognition was a secondary end-
point in AMP-502, which demonstrated statistical signifi-
cant improvement versus placebo. Improvements observed
in the placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trials were
observed in the open label trials, detailed in the supple-
mental data and provide further confidence that rintatoli-
mod is clinically active in a substantial number of patients
with CFS/ME.
Safety and tolerability
Human trial safety
Chronic administration of rintatolimod in clinical trials has
been generally well tolerated. To date, over 90,000 doses
have been infused intravenously. The major toxicities seen in
a minority of patients during the first weeks of infusion are
mild flu-like symptoms probably secondary to the induction of
interferon. Table 10 provides all adverse events observed in
the rintatolimod Phase II/III-controlled clinical trials in which
there is >5% difference between drug and placebo cohorts.
There were a total of 44 serious adverse events (SAE)
observed, which were equally divided between the rintatoli-
mod and placebo cohorts. In the opinion of the site principal
investigators, none of the SAEs were definitely attributable to
the study drugs (rintatolimod or placebo). One probable SAE
occurred in the placebo cohort (Table 11). Summation of all
SAEs (open label plus controlled clinical trials) demonstrates
that 7.7% of patients receiving rintatolimod experienced a SAE
compared to 8.6% of the placebo cohort [42].

 Comparative animal toxicities
Rintatolimod demonstrates significant reduced toxicity in pri-
mates versus other animal species [20]. Table 12 provides the
relative species-dependent acute toxicity of rintatolimod.
There is a two order of magnitude difference in the relative
toxicities between rabbits and the cynomolgus monkey with
dog and rat showing intermediate toxicities between the
extremes. This relative toxicity differential is extended to
sub-acute and chronic toxicity studies in rats versus primates.
In the rat hematological, hepatic, bone marrow, and thyroid
pathologies have been observed [20]. In the cynomolgus
monkey, the only significant observed anomaly is in the thyr-
oid and bone marrow. At higher doses (greater than equiva-
lent clinical dosing), thyroid is associated with follicular
hyperplasia and increases in plasma TSH and T4. Significantly
no elevations of thyroid hormones have been observed in
humans. Increased myelopoiesis has been observed in mon-
keys. No bone marrow examinations have been conducted in
humans.
There is no evidence that rintatolimod can be carcinogenic.
RNAs are recognized as electrophilic targets for chemical car-
cinogens, but not as carcinogens themselves. Indeed, it is
probably not possible for non-coding dsRNAs such as rintato-
limod to be carcinogenic and this is supported by a compre-
hensive literature review. An extensive review of the current
literature including standard toxicology/reference texts found
no evidence that dsRNA can act as a carcinogen [42]. In
addition, the National Toxicology Program lists no RNA as a
suspected or proven carcinogen. Similarly, there is no evi-
dence that rintatolimod can serve as a source for the genera-
tion of siRNAs or microRNAs [42]. Mutagenesis studies in four
independent
studies
with
rintatolimod
were
negative
(Table 13) [42]. Classical two species, 2-year studies for carci-
nogenesis have not been done. However, a 6-month study in
the rat and cynomolgus monkey provided no evidence of
cancer or pre-cancer dysplasias in the multiple organs exam-
ined [42]. In rat, embryological studies indicated a potential for
fetal death and miscarriage [42]. There has been no indication
of teratological toxicity in rat [42]. In rabbits, a decrease was
seen in fetal number and weight. Toxicity in female rabbits
may be associated with malformations or defects in fetal
rabbits [42]. The differential toxicities between rats and
humans
are
correlated
with
relative
systemic
cytokine
responses
as
well
as
differential
blood
half-lives
[20].
Statistically significant dose-dependent cytokine differences
between rats and non-human primates have been observed
during the first week of rintatolimod administration as well as
at Week 8 [20]. Human plasma has greater nuclease activity
than other species and complements the estimates of relative
species toxicities found in the comparative acute toxicity ana-
lysis (Table 12).
Regulatory affairs
The first CFS/ME patient treated with rintatolimod was at the
request of the FDA. The dramatic response of this index
patient resulted in an open-label clinical trial (AMP-501) [41]
that yield results that mimicked the index patient. The success
of that trial resulted in a major effort by Hemispherx
Biopharma to bring the drug to market. During a multi-decade
dialog with the FDA, rintatolimod has been sequestered with
five separate review groups. Currently there is an open NDA
with continuing dialog with the FDA. As detailed earlier, there
have been two double-blind, placebo-controlled trials. Both
trials achieved statistically significant improvements in their
primary endpoints with minimal toxicities. The drug has not
received a marketing approval despite the lack of proven
efficacious agents in the treatment of this disease that can
be severely debilitating and is estimated to affect over one
million persons in the U.S. Rintatolimod has FDA orphan drug
status with individual patient access to the drug with a treat-
ment protocol for CFS/ME (AMP-511) in existence for nearly
two decades. Recent post hoc studies have demonstrated that
about 40% of CFS/ME patients can be expected to respond to
rintatolimod while about 10% of the poorest responders
appear to be retarded in deterioration of symptoms with
time [44]. A CFS/ME-modified treadmill test provides an objec-
tive basis to select those patients most likely to have a vigor-
ous response to rintatolimod.
Discussion
Rintatolimod has been generally well tolerated and significantly
improved physical performance primary endpoints in two dou-
ble-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials that are supported by
five open-label trials, one of which was a cross-over of a Phase
III trial that remained double-blinded as to original assignment
group (active drug versus placebo). Rintatolimod is not active in

 all patients. Indeed, the multiplicity of patient primary and
secondary responses to rintatolimod was not unexpected.
CFS/ME is a syndrome with the common unifying symptom of
profound fatigue. Approximately, 30–40% of severe CFS/ME
patients can be expected to achieve some clinical benefit
using the original CDC definition with severity defined as
KPS ≤ 60. There is substantial evidence to support the hypoth-
esis that individuals with persistence of debilitating symptoms
are
associated
with
a
variety
of
inappropriate
immune
responses initiated by an intracellular pathogen and driven by
dysfunctional gene responses that fail to clear or suppress the
initiating agent. The differential responses observed with rinta-
tolimod administration support this hypothesis. It is thus of
interest to consider the potential of possible pathogens and
modifying influences of dysfunctional gene expression and
immune responses observed in CFS/ME.
Acute infection and fatigue
The fatigue associated with acute infection is usually self-
limited
although
some
may
have
a
prolonged
course.
Examples of the latter include Epstein-Barr virus (HHV-4), the
causative agent of acute infectious mononucleosis, and
Borrelia burgdorferi (post-treatment chronic Lyme disease).
Recent proteomic analysis of cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) from
persistence of these two infectious agents, however, distin-
guish patients with chronic Lyme disease from CFS/ME [46].
Studies linking contemporaneous laboratory diagnosis of
acute infectious agents with the subsequent development of
CFS/ME are rare although non-contemporaneous reports of a
variety of infectious agents associated with CFS are common.
An example of a prospective infectious diagnosis with the
subsequent development of CFS/ME was established in a
small community in Australia [47] using IgM to IgG serocon-
version or rising IgG titers to Epstein-Barr virus (a DNA virus),
Ross River virus (an alpha RNA virus), and Coxiella burnetii (an
obligate intracellular bacterium and the causative agent of Q
fever). Of the 253 patients with antibody evidence of acute
infection with these 3 intracellular pathogens, 12% subse-
quently developed CSF/ME demonstrating that no single
infectious agent is responsible for the syndrome and that
induction of CFS/ME is dependent on factors other than pri-
mary infection. Similarly, in a small study CSF/ME patients with
diagnostic high titer IgG titers to Chlamydophila pneumoniae,
an obligate intracellular bacterium associated with atypical
pneumonia, responded to anti-Chlamydial antibiotics with
symptom resolution and declining antibody titers suggesting
a cause and effect relationship [48]. There are a small number
of case reports of the association of parvovirus B19 (a small
ssDNA virus causing erythema infectiousum in children) and
CFS/ME with resolution in three cases treated with pooled
human immunoglobulin [49]. In a study involving 200 patients
with CSF/ME, no differences between patients and controls
were found in IgM or IgG titers against structural proteins of
parvovirus B19 although 42% of patients versus 7% of controls
had antibodies against the viral regulatory NS1 protein [50]
suggesting a non-productive persistence of parvovirus B19.
The affinity of polioviruses (enteroviruses) with their infection
affinity for the CNS and GI tract has generated a number of
studies linking CFS/ME with the enteroviruses. A large study of
165 CSF/ME patients exhibited the enteroviral VP1 structural
antigen in 82% of gastric biopsies versus 20% of controls [51].
Mycoplasma have been demonstrated by PCR in PBMC in
several studies [52,53] of patients with CFS/ME. Although
effective antibiotic treatment is available, no antibiotic studies
have been reported in CFS/ME associated with mycoplasma.
Two studies linking retroviruses with CFS/ME have proven to
be non-reproducible in the scientific community. The first
described a retrovirus with sequence homologies to HTLV II
[54]. More recently XMRV [55] and the closely associated
polytrophic virus [56] have proven to be laboratory artifacts
[57] although their reports generated premature attempts at
therapy with anti-retroviral agents used for control of HIV.
Similar to Epstein-Barr virus, most adults have antibodies to
HHV-6 with no evidence of persistent-related disease. Unlike
Epstein-Barr virus, however, numerous studies using culture
and PCR have been reported linking HHV-6 with CFS/ME. In a
study reported before a formal definition of CFS/ME had been
developed, 70% of 259 patients with a CFS-like illness exhib-
ited active HHV-6 replication in lymphocytes in primary culture
[58]. The first patient treated with rintatolimod at the request
of the FDA more than 2 decades ago had primary culture
evidence of an active HHV-6 infection [59]. On the basis of
that patient’s rapid response to rintatolimod, the first open
label trial was initiated in CFS/ME patients with evidence of a
HHV-6 infection that similarly showed significant activity [41].
The available HHV-6 data is consistent with the CFS/ME cohort
responding to rintatolimod treatment. Conversely, those
patients with evidence of Chlamydial infection responding to
antibiotics may populate a TLR3 agonist (rintatolimod) non-
responder cohort.
Multiple co-infections
Nicolson et al. [60] reported on the incidence of co-infections
in 200 CFS patients and 100 controls by PCR analysis of whole
blood. A total of 52% of CFS patients versus 6% of controls
had evidence for the presence of at least one Mycoplasma
species. A total of 7% were PCR positive for C.pneumoniae
versus 1% in the controls and 30.5% positive for HHV-6 and
9% in the controls. Evidence for co-infection in Mycoplasma
positive blood had similar incidences although there was no
evidence of co-infections with these pathogens in the control
cohort. One might logically expect a mixed non-cleared infec-
tion to respond to rintatolimod variably similar to the current
mid-third minimal responders.
Despite two decades of attempts to identify specific infec-
tious agents as the initiator of the signs and symptoms of CFS/
ME, it is apparent that a multiplicity of obligate intracellular
pathogens are capable of disease initiation. Although the
pathogenesis of persistence in a minority of affected indivi-
duals has remained unclear, dysfunctional genetic responses
involving the immune system and energy metabolism have
been linked to the CFS/ME phenotype.
Immune markers
Consistent with the evidence of infection with multiple obli-
gate intracellular pathogens are the increased numbers of

 activated cytotoxic CD8+ cells observed in CFS/ME [61].
Although NK cell numbers are generally in a normal range,
NK cell function is decreased [62]. The IFN inducible 2ʹ-5ʹ
adenylate synthetase/ RNase L pathway is dysfunctional in
CFS/ME. Constituitive RNase L is activated by 2ʹ-5ʹ oligomers
of adenine that results in cellular mRNA degradation. 2ʹ-5ʹ
adenylate synthetase (2ʹ-5ʹA) transiently induced by Type 1
IFNs requires dsRNA for activation. In CFS/ME there is as much
as a log increase in bioactive 2ʹ-5ʹA with a concomitant reduc-
tion in latent 2ʹ-5ʹA and increase in the bioactivity of RNase L
in PBMCs [63,64]. A clinical evaluation demonstrated that 46 of
73 patients with CFS/ME had an elevation of RNase L activity
that was associated with a significant (p < 0.001) decrease in
ET [65]. The dramatic increase in bioactive 2ʹ-5ʹA has been
substantially linked to a 37kD proteolytic fragment of the
expressed 83kD enzyme [66,67]. The up-regulation of 2ʹ-5ʹA
synthetase/RNase L pathway is consistent with an antiviral
response pathway that has been rendered dysfunctional by
aberrant PBMC intracellular proteolysis. The latter is the result
of 2ʹ-5ʹA synthetase dysfunction in some patients with CFS/ME
with the production of dimers rather than higher oligomers of
2ʹ-5ʹA that inhibit proteolysis of the native RNase L [68].
Although the existing methodology is research lab-based
and not suitable for high volume reference or hospital-based
laboratories, the relative abundance of the 37kD RNase L
fragment relative to the intact 83kD enzyme has been sug-
gested as a clinical lab assay for CFS/ME [69,70]. The observed
normalization of this dysfunctional immune response to viral
activation by IFN further suggests correction by rintatolimod
of a viral initiation phenomena in CFS/ME.
Genetic markers
Differential gene expression in peripheral blood of CFS/ME
patients has been reported by a number of investigators
using DNA microchip analysis [71–81]. Recently, rigorous
patient selection and a microchip that surveys the entire
human genome coupled with qPCR gene validation has
provided a more complete appreciation of the gene expres-
sion profiles that occur in CSF [9,82]. A complex array of
differential gene expression can be categorized into func-
tional subsets relating to responses to infection, immunity,
inflammation, apoptosis, neurological function, and cancer
[79]. Many of these differential gene responses are consis-
tent with the large number of infectious agents linked with
CFS/ME as well as the altered immune responses and variety
of signs and symptoms observed with the disease. For
example, eIF4G1 is an eukaryotic mitochondrial translation
factor utilized in replication by a variety of viruses including
the enteroviruses implicated in the pathogenesis of CFS/ME
[83]. EIF4G1 variant 5 (GenBank:NM_004953) is up-regulated
in CFS/ME suggesting a physiological response to viral repli-
cation as well as a gene variant favoring pathogen persis-
tence. Similarly, genes associated with Epstein Barr Virus
infection have been demonstrated recently to be up-regu-
lated in most Kerr CSF/ME subtypes [84]. Patients with fati-
gue associated with Q-fever have similar gene expression
profiles with CSF/ME [84].
Differential gene responses have been analyzed as a func-
tion of exercise tolerance in CFS/ME. Whistler et al. [73,74]
associated exercise-dependent gene expression with the spe-
cific Gene Ontology categories of chromatin and nucleosome
assemblies, cytoplasmic vesicles, membrane transport, and
G-protein-coupled receptor. Distinct differences as a function
of exercise have been demonstrated between CFS/ME, fibro-
myalgia, and multiple sclerosis [85,86].
Mitochondrial function markers
Abnormal mitochondrial function [87] and structure by light
and electron microscopy [88] have been observed in CFS/ME
and consistent with reported muscle oxidative damage [89]
and acetylcarnitine [90] and carnitine serum deficiencies [91].
A novel deletion in mitochondrial genes associated with
energy production has been reported in a CFS/ME patient
distinct from a common 4977 bp deletion observed in overt
mitochondrial diseases [92]. The common 4977 bp deletion in
mitochondrial DNA in CFS/ME has been reported 150–3000
times normal controls [93]. Rapid muscle intracellular acidosis
in a CFS/ME patient detected by 31P nuclear magnetic reso-
nance (31P-NMR) spectroscopy was suggestive of impaired
oxidative metabolism [94]. Subsequent 31P-NMR studies
demonstrated reduced biosynthesis of phosphocreatine [95]
and lower levels of intracellular ATP [96] post-exercise. An ATP
profile test consisting of ATP cytosolic transfer, oxidative phos-
phorylation efficiency, and the efficiency of ADP concentration
within mitochondria from the cytoplasm in neutrophils has
been reported [87]. Delivery of mitochondrial ATP to the
cytoplasm as a function of CFS/ME severity as compared to
normal controls demonstrated a clear discrimination of CFS/
ME severity (p < 0.001) with no overlap with controls. The ATP
assay suggests that the mitochondrial dysfunction in CFS/ME
is multi-factorial and provides a rational basis for the exercise
intolerance observed in CFS/ME and the differential response
in exercise tolerance to rintatolimod [44].
Rintatolimod and CFS/ME markers of disease
Rintatolimod is clearly active in improvement of ET and quality
of life in a subset of patients with CFS/ME. Moreover, the
clinical evidence suggests that rintatolimod inhibits disease
deterioration in a minority of patients who fail to show
improvement from activation of TLR3. The basis for this differ-
ential response to rintatolimod is unknown but may be sec-
ondary to a variety of microbes coupled with a combination of
genetic polymorphisms resulting in an immune response
unable to clear either a productive microbial infection or an
activated non-replicative intracellular microbe. The diagnosis
of CFS/ME remains a diagnosis of exclusion. To date, there
have been no laboratory-based markers for CFS/ME diagnosis
although there have been potential candidates that unfortu-
nately have not been adapted by clinical reference labora-
tories.
Prime
examples
include
a
dysfunctional
2ʹ-5ʹ
adenylate synthetase (2ʹ-5ʹA) and functionally inactive NK
cells reported in CFS/ME by multiple investigators. RNAse L
has been observed by De Meirlier to be corrected by rintato-
limod in patients (AMP-509 trial) [42].

W. M. MITCHELL
 Functional impairment of NK cells has been studied by
multiple investigators and found to be up-regulated by rinta-
tolimod in vitro [62] although the necessary validation in
patient trials has not been accomplished to date. Moreover,
the functional research assay used (Cr51 release from NK target
cells) needs to be coordinated with the large number of NK
cell markers that are available for flow cytometry on fixed cells.
Despite the obvious need for inexpensive laboratory markers
to aid clinicians in the diagnosis of CFS/ME as well as indica-
tors of rintatolimod efficacy, there has been no national prior-
ity established for development.
Response to rintatolimod is apparently related to a multi-
factorial pathogenic basis with a variety of reported intracel-
lular pathogens, hormonal, and immunological abnormalities
linked with a variety of genetic signatures. Those patients able
to reach 9 minutes on a CFS/ME-modified Bruce protocol are
evidence-based responders to the drug. About 10% of CFS/ME
patients with the poorest exercise tolerance may experience
less disease progression. No drug is approved for the CFS/ME
indication and I know of no other pharmaceutical company
with drugs in advanced development despite FDA attempts to
promote development by the pharmaceutical industry.
Expert commentary
TLR3 is unique in its induction of innate immune responses.
The exclusive use of a non-MyD88 pathway limits expression
of inflammatory cytokines especially in humans as compared
to non-primate animal models. Rintatolimod further extends
this unique property by its lack of stimulation of the cytosolic
helicases utilizing a non-TRIF signaling pathway observed with
non-mismatched
dsRNA
polymers.
Although
significant
improvements in physical performance primary endpoints
has been seen in the Phase II/III trials and is supported by
open label trials, the final regulatory approval may require
objective laboratory diagnostics that identify patients most
likely to respond to rintatolimod. Fatigue is the universal
symptom of this disabling condition and is a common symp-
tom in a multiplicity of human diseases (examples include
multiple sclerosis, cancer, severe anemia, hypothyroidism).
Table 14 lists the most likely diagnostic markers to identify
responders to rintatolimod and their current developmental
status. Rintatolimod has an extensive safety record in humans
in which primates demonstrate significantly fewer toxic man-
ifestations of a restricted TLR3 activation than non-primates.
CFS/ME is a complex syndrome with a variety of diverse
factors including gene expression related to disease induction.
The identification of markers that can be adapted to clinical
reference laboratories to identify rintatolimod responders
would provide objective criteria for non-CFS/ME physicians
and should provide a regulatory pathway to approval in
CFS/ME.
Five-year view
Rintatolimod has been demonstrated to reach statistical sig-
nificance in two randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled
clinical trials with patients with well-defined disease. No other
pharmaceutical is in apparent development for this woefully
neglected disease. Orphan drug status and the recent award
of a new form and substance patent [97] for rintatolimod
provides
extended
commercial
viability.
Rintatolimod,
a
restricted TLR3 agonist, is clearly active in a subset of CFS/
ME patients and appears to reduce further disease deteriora-
tion in those patients who fail to improve physically. Genetic
and immune markers identified (Table 14) may provide
insights to other drugs for combinatorial CFS/ME therapy in
which rintatolimod alone is non-efficacious. The use of Next
Generation Sequencing of plasma and PBMN cells is needed to
identify unknown systemic infectious agents such as from the
gut microbiome that may be part of the etiological process in
some patients with CFS/ME.

Marker
Rationale
Improvements
ET>9 minutes on modified Bruce
protocol
Demonstrated in Phase II and Phase III clinical trials
ET under measurement of O2 utilization and CO2 production
to insure acquisition of ‘oxygen debt’ as objective
evidence of termination due to exhaustion
Low NK cell function enhancement Low NK cell functional activity demonstrated in multiple
studies. Low NK cell activity up-regulated with rintatolimod
in vitro
In vitro response has not been correlated with in vivo
response in CFS/ME patients. Cr51 release assay from NK
cell target cells in vitro is a research lab assay. NK cell
markers used in flow cytometry with fixed cells needs
correlation with Cr51 release response to rintatolimod
37kD RNAse L
Low MW proteolytic form of RNAse L in CFS/ME
demonstrated in multiple studies. Response to
rintatolimod demonstrated in patients. Alternatively,
dimer/trimer (and above) ratios can be determined and
quantified
Research methods of analysis are not suitable for clinical
reference laboratories. Identification of 37kD/83kD forms
should be amenable to mass spectrometry analysis as
well as 2ʹ-5ʹA oligomers
Mitochondrial dysfunction
Assayed in PBMCs from a single laboratory in multiple
reports. Observed in muscle by the same laboratory
Assay needs independent validation. Early ET oxygen debt
experienced by CFS/ME patients supports data in PBMCs
Multiplex PCR analysis of mRNA
and SNPs in literature identified
genes associated with CFS/ME
Platforms supporting multiplex analysis for dozens of
identified genes are available that allow simultaneous
quantitative analysis of genes implicated in CFS/ME
Key genes can be identified with practical analysis using
multiplex platforms available in clinical reference
laboratories
Massive parallel sequencing
Identification of microorganisms in plasma and/or PBMCs by
Next Generation Sequencing (NGS). Human sequences
easily distinguished from non-human
New NGS platforms are currently reaching clinical reference
laboratories with significant reduction in costs. Potential
for identification of new pathogens responsive to
rintatolimod. New SNPs identifiable

 Key issues
● Rintatolimod is a high MW synthetic mismatched double-
stranded (ds) RNA (Poly I: Poly C12U) polymer
● Rintatolimod activates TLR3 that induces innate immune
responses and initiates adaptive immunity
● All Toll-Like Receptors with the exception of TLR3 activate
the pro-inflammatory cytosolic MyD88 pathway
● TLR3 uniquely activates the cytosolic TRIF pathway with
limited pro-inflammatory responses especially in primates
● Rintatolimod is a restricted TLR3 agonist with no activation
of the cytosolic helicases that use a non-TRIF pathway
● Restriction of rintatolimod provides an improved safety
profile compared to other dsRNA agonists
● Rintatolimod has achieved statistical significance in rando-
mized Phase II and Phase III double-blind, placebo-con-
trolled, multi-site clinical trials in which the drug was
administered IV bi-weekly for up to forty weeks in patients
with severe CFS/ME
● Rintatolimod was generally well tolerated with adverse
events randomly distributed between drug and placebo
cohorts with the exception of initial mild flu-like symptoms
in some patients
● Approximately 30–40% of CFS/ME patients can be expected
to respond beneficially to rintatolimod
