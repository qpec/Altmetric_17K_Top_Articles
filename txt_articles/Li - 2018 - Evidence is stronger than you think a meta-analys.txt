Evidence is stronger than you think: a
meta-analysis of vitamin C use in patients
with sepsis
Jing Li
Abstract
Two recent publications by Sheikh and Horner and
Teng et al. reviewed studies on incorporating vitamin
C to treat septic patients; however, a meta-analysis
was not offered in either report. This commentary
extends both reviews by integrating a meta-analysis
and sharing aggregated results. Pooled analyses
demonstrated a marked reduction in mortality and
duration of vasopressor administration in the group
with the use of vitamin C.
Keywords: Sepsis, Severe sepsis, Sepsis management,
Vitamin C, Ascorbic acid, Meta-analysis
Background
Sepsis is a severe condition with high mortality rates.
Sheikh and Horner [1] and Teng et al. [2] recently pub-
lished review articles regarding the incorporation of vita-
min C in the treatment of sepsis. While the reviews
offered insightful appraisals regarding the original stud-
ies and reported them in perspective, a meta-analysis
was not produced and therefore aggregated quantitative
results were not available for review. Considering both
reviews were recent publications, this commentary ex-
tends their work by performing a meta-analysis and
demonstrating the pooled results.
Main text
Sheikh and Horner [1] conducted a literature search of
EMBASE, Medline, and PubMed through January 2018
surrounding sepsis and intravenous vitamin C; Teng
et al. [2] completed a review of the literature using
PubMed in terms of sepsis and vitamin C. Teng et al.
summarized five pertinent papers in their review; how-
ever, two of the original articles described in their

review, one written by Fowler et al. [3] and the other by
Natarajan et al. [4], were derived from the same clinical
trial. In addition, the study reported by Tanaka et al.
concerned patients with burns [5]. Although the authors
reasoned that most deaths in modern burn centers are
from septic shock [5], this paper was deemed irrelevant
for the review and meta-analysis on sepsis and vitamin
C. After removing one of the duplicate studies—the
Natarajan et al. paper—and the Tanaka et al. paper, the
three studies summarized by Teng et al. matched those
of Sheikh and Horner. A search of EMBASE and
PubMed similar to that of Sheikh and Horner was per-
formed on 8 June 2018, but no further full-text articles
were found; therefore, the three papers reviewed by
Sheikh and Horner were included in the meta-analysis.
Table 1 describes the characteristics of the included
studies and assesses the quality and potential biases of
each study. Even though all three studies looked at treat-
ing septic patients with vitamin C, the quality of results
varied due to differences in study design, inclusion cri-
teria, and sample size. The studies by both Fowler et al.
[3] and Zabet et al. [6] were randomized, double-blind,
placebo-controlled clinical trials of small sample sizes,
while the Marik et al. study [7] was a before-after study
with propensity score adjustment. It is worth noting that
Marik et al. included intravenous hydrocortisone and
thiamine, in addition to vitamin C, thereby introducing
confounders into the study [7]. Three clinical outcomes
were reported by at least two articles, which were mor-
tality, intensive care unit length of stay (ICU-LOS), and
vasopressor duration [3, 6, 7].
A meta-analysis was performed on these three out-
comes
using
Comprehensive
Meta-Analysis
(version
3.3.070). Considering diversity in the study populations
and differences in the treatments including varying doses
of vitamin C, a random-effects model was used in all
analyses. Mortality was considered the primary outcome
for this meta-analysis, and a fail-safe N test was carried

 out to assess publication bias. Fowler et al. randomized
patients into three groups: low-dose ascorbic acid,
high-dose ascorbic acid, and placebo [3]. The low-dose
and high-dose groups were combined into the vitamin C
group for meta-analysis. If the original study did not in-
corporate a power analysis or mention a one-sided or
two-sided test, a two-sided test was assumed.
All three studies reported mortality rates between the
experimental arm with the use of vitamin C and the
control arm without vitamin C. While the mortality re-
sults from two studies [6, 7] favored the vitamin C treat-
ment at the significance level of 0.05, the study by
Fowler et al. [3] did not reach statistical significance.
Pooled analysis of all three studies revealed a marked re-
duction in mortality with the use of vitamin C (odds ra-
tio (OR) = 0.17, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.07–0.40;
p < 0.001; Fig. 1a). No significant heterogeneity between
studies was found (I2 = 0; p = 0.40 for Cochran’s Q).
Due to the strong effect size of two of the three stud-
ies, the computed fail-safe N would require nine
null-finding studies to render this pooled result non-
significant at α = 0.05.
All three studies reported ICU-LOS. Results from
Marik et al. [7] and Zabet et al. [6] were incorporated in
the meta-analysis; however, the study by Fowler et al. [3]
was excluded as it did not provide either standard
deviation (SD) for direct synthesis or the median for es-
timating SD [8]. Although Marik et al. reported median
and interquartile range for ICU-LOS in their publication,
the mean and SD were supplied by Dr. Marik via an
email inquiry [7]. Pooled analysis favored the use of
vitamin C, but statistical significance was not reached
(standardized

use. Results from Marik et al. [7] and Zabet et al. [6]

 provide either SD for direct synthesis or the median for
estimating SD, and the duration was summarized in days
while the other two studies reported hours [8]. Pooled
analysis showed a significant reduction in duration of
vasopressor administration in the group with vitamin C
(SMD = −1.57, 95% CI −2.03 to −1.11; p < 0.001; Fig. 1c).
Heterogeneity between these two studies was not signifi-
cant (I2 = 15.0%; p = 0.28 for Cochran’s Q).
Conclusions
Despite varying degrees of statistical significance be-
tween the original studies, this meta-analysis reveals a
positive correlation between incorporating vitamin C in
the treatment of sepsis and favorable patient outcomes,
including better survival and shorter duration of vaso-
pressor use; I2 was shown to be insignificant, and there-
fore corroborates the consistency of evidence. Since this
is a quantitative synthesis of a small number of studies,
further randomized clinical trials are required to prove a
causal relationship. If this relationship is confirmed, vita-
min C has enormous potential to improve patient care
and reduce mortality rates due to its low cost and wide
availability.
