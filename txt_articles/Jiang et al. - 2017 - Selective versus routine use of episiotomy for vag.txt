Background
Some clinicians believe that routine episiotomy, a surgical cut of the vagina and perineum, will prevent serious tears during childbirth.
On the other hand, an episiotomy guarantees perineal trauma and sutures.
Objectives
To assess the effects on mother and baby of a policy of selective episiotomy (’only if needed’) compared with a policy of routine
episiotomy (’part of routine management’) for vaginal births.
Search methods
We searched Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth’s Trials Register (14 September 2016) and reference lists of retrieved studies.
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing selective versus routine use of episiotomy, irrespective of parity, setting or surgical type
of episiotomy. We included trials where either unassisted or assisted vaginal births were intended. Quasi-RCTs, trials using a cross-over
design or those published in abstract form only were not eligible for inclusion in this review.
Data collection and analysis
Two authors independently screened studies, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. A third author mediated where there was no
clear consensus. We observed good practice for data analysis and interpretation where trialists were review authors. We used fixed-effect
models unless heterogeneity precluded this, expressed results as risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI), and assessed the
certainty of the evidence using GRADE.

Cochrane Collaboration.
 Main results
This updated review includes 12 studies (6177 women), 11 in women in labour for whom a vaginal birth was intended, and one
in women where an assisted birth was anticipated. Two were trials each with more than 1000 women (Argentina and the UK), and
the rest were smaller (from Canada, Germany, Spain, Ireland, Malaysia, Pakistan, Columbia and Saudi Arabia). Eight trials included
primiparous women only, and four trials were in both primiparous and multiparous women. For risk of bias, allocation was adequately
concealed and reported in nine trials; sequence generation random and adequately reported in three trials; blinding of outcomes
adequate and reported in one trial, blinding of participants and personnel reported in one trial.
For women where an unassisted vaginal birth was anticipated, a policy of selective episiotomy may result in 30% fewer women
experiencing severe perineal/vaginal trauma (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.52 to 0.94; 5375 women; eight RCTs; low-certainty evidence). We
do not know if there is a difference for blood loss at delivery (an average of 27 mL less with selective episiotomy, 95% CI from 75 mL
less to 20 mL more; two trials, 336 women, very low-certainty evidence). Both selective and routine episiotomy have little or no effect
on infants with Apgar score less than seven at five minutes (four trials, no events; 3908 women, moderate-certainty evidence); and
there may be little or no difference in perineal infection (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.82, three trials, 1467 participants, low-certainty
evidence).
For pain, we do not know if selective episiotomy compared with routine results in fewer women with moderate or severe perineal pain
(measured on a visual analogue scale) at three days postpartum (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.48 to 1.05, one trial, 165 participants, very low-
certainty evidence). There is probably little or no difference for long-term (six months or more) dyspareunia (RR1.14, 95% CI 0.84
to 1.53, three trials, 1107 participants, moderate-certainty evidence); and there may be little or no difference for long-term (six months
or more) urinary incontinence (average RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.44, three trials, 1107 participants, low-certainty evidence). One
trial reported genital prolapse at three years postpartum. There was no clear difference between the two groups (RR 0.30, 95% CI
0.06 to 1.41; 365 women; one trial, low certainty evidence). Other outcomes relating to long-term effects were not reported (urinary
fistula, rectal fistula, and faecal incontinence). Subgroup analyses by parity (primiparae versus multiparae) and by surgical method
(midline versus mediolateral episiotomy) did not identify any modifying effects. Pain was not well assessed, and women’s preferences
were not reported.
One trial examined selective episiotomy compared with routine episiotomy in women where an operative vaginal delivery was intended
in 175 women, and did not show clear difference on severe perineal trauma between the restrictive and routine use of episiotomy, but
the analysis was underpowered.
Authors’ conclusions
In women where no instrumental delivery is intended, selective episiotomy policies result in fewer women with severe perineal/vaginal
trauma. Other findings, both in the short or long term, provide no clear evidence that selective episiotomy policies results in harm to
mother or baby.
The review thus demonstrates that believing that routine episiotomy reduces perineal/vaginal trauma is not justified by current evidence.
Further research in women where instrumental delivery is intended may help clarify if routine episiotomy is useful in this particular
group. These trials should use better, standardised outcome assessment methods.

Selective versus routine use of episiotomy for vaginal birth
What is the issue?
Normal birth can cause tears to the vagina and the surrounding tissue, usually as the baby’s head is born, and sometimes these tears
extend to the rectum. These are repaired surgically, but take time to heal. To avoid these severe tears, doctors have recommended making
a surgical cut to the perineum with scissors or scalpel to prevent severe tearing and facilitate the birth. This intervention, known as an
episiotomy, is used as a routine care policy during births in some countries. Both a tear and an episiotomy need sutures, and can result
in severe pain, bleeding, infection, pain with sex, and can contribute to long term urinary incontinence.
Why is this important?
An episiotomy requires suturing and benefits and harms as part of routine management of normal births remains unclear. In particular,
we need to know if it does indeed prevent large tears, because women otherwise may be subjected to an unnecessary operation, pain and

 in some cases long-term problems. The question of whether to apply a policy of routine episiotomy is important for clinical practice
and for the health and well-being of women and babies.
What evidence did we find?
We prepared this edition of this review by updating the methods and searching for evidence from the medical literature on 14 September
2016. The review now includes 11 randomised controlled trials (with 5977 women) that compared episiotomy as needed (selective
episiotomy) with routine episiotomy in terms of benefits and harms for mother and baby in women at low risk of instrumental delivery.
The trials were from ten different countries. In women where health staff were only conducting selective episiotomy, there may be 30%
fewer with severe perineal trauma at birth compared with women where a policy of routine episiotomy was applied (eight trials, 5375
women, low-certainty evidence). We do not know if there is a difference in average blood loss between the groups (two trials, very low-
certainty evidence). There is probably no difference in Apgar less than seven at five minutes, with no events in either groups (moderate-
certainty evidence). We do not know if there is a difference in the number of women with moderate or severe perineal pain three days
after giving birth (one trial, 165 women, very low-certainty evidence) but careful assessment of women’s pain was not well carried out
in the included trials. There may be little or no difference in the number of women developing perineal infection (two trials, low-
certainty evidence); and there is probably little or no difference in women reporting painful sexual intercourse six months or more after
delivery (three trials, 1107 women, moderate-certainty evidence); for urinary incontinence six months or more after delivery, there
may be little or no difference between the groups. One study reported genital prolapse three years after the birth and there was no clear
difference between groups (low-certainty evidence). Other important outcomes relating to long-term effects were not reported in these
trials (urinary fistula, rectal fistula, and faecal incontinence).
One trial examined selective episiotomy compared with routine episiotomy in women for whom an operative vaginal birth was intended.
The results showed no clear difference in severe perineal trauma between the restrictive and routine use of episiotomy.
Women’s views on the different policies were not reported.
What does this mean?
Overall, the findings show that selective use of episiotomy in women (where a normal delivery without forceps is anticipated) means
that fewer women have severe perineal trauma. Thus the rationale for conducting routine episiotomies to prevent severe perineal trauma
is not justified by current evidence, and we could not identify any benefits of routine episiotomy for the baby or the mother.
More research is needed in order to inform policy in women where an instrumental birth is planned and episiotomy is often advocated.
Outcomes could be better standardised and measured.

Selective versus routine episiotomy: all vaginal births where operative vaginal delivery was not anticipated
Patient or population: Women in labour where operative delivery was not anticipated. (Women were above 16 years old and between 28 gestational weeks and full term, with
a live singleton fetus, without severe medical or psychiatric conditions, and had vaginal birth.)
Setting: Hospitals in high-, middle- and low-income countries. (Studies were carried out between July 1982 and October 2009, in Argentina, Canada, Columbia, Germany,
Ireland, Malaysia, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Spain, and the UK. Five studies were carried out in university teaching hospitals, and one of these five studies recruited some
participants from a mid-complexity level hospital. The other six studies were conducted in maternity units with inadequate information to judge the institution’s level.)
Intervention: Selective episiotomy (episiotomy rates in the selective group ranged from 8% to 59%)
Comparison: Routine episiotomy (episiotomy rates in the routine group ranged from 61% to 100%; episiotomy rate differences between the groups within trials varied from
21% to 91%)

1Downgraded by 1 for imprecision: confidence intervals range from no important difference to large difference.
2Downgraded by 1 for heterogeneity: there is moderate heterogeneity. Random-effects model gives confidence intervals that
cross 1 (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.41 to 1.09). However, a subgroup analysis shows that the selective episiotomy has been well
implemented (episiotomy rate difference between intervention and control > 30%) there was a more substantial effect (RR
0.55, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.81; 8 trials; n = 4877).
3Funnel plot suggests publication bias with small studies showing that routine episiotomy results in higher perineal trauma.
4Downgraded by 1 for risk of bias: both studies used visual inspection with no specific training, but visual EBL consistently
results in underestimation of large volumes and over estimation of large volumes.
5Downgraded by 1 for imprecision: confidence intervals range from no important average loss to an important average loss
6Downgraded by 1 for inconsistency: large, probably clinically important effect in 1 trial and no effect evident in the other trial
7Downgraded by 1 for imprecision as there were no events. Risk difference 0.0 (-0.01 to 0.01). The risk difference provides
confidence intervals indicating we are confident in there being little or no difference, although for rare but important events a
larger sample size is required.
8Apgar < 7 at 1 minute was measured in 4 trials, with RR 1.04 (95% CI 0.76 to 1.43), with no detectable heterogeneity.
9Downgraded by 2 for imprecision: few events, and CI included appreciable benefit and harm. (The analysis is under-powered
to detect a difference between groups; the sample size required to half 2% infection rate in the control group to 1% in the
intervention group with 90% power at 5% significance would be 6202)
10Downgraded by 2 for imprecision: sample size to lower the 30% pain in the selective episiotomy compared to routine would
need a total size of 586 with 90% power at 5% significance level, and wide confidence intervals from substantively fewer to
no fewer
11Downgraded by 1 for indirectness: only one trial conducted 32 years ago. Conditions, expectations, and pain relief strategies
have changed, and we don’t know how representative this trial is.
12Additional trials report on average pain scores in the first 5 days, in a total of 355 women. Pain scores in all 3 trials were
similar between the 2 groups (additional table 5).
13Downgraded by 1 for imprecision: confidence intervals have a wide range.

rate of loss to follow-up, around 35%, 1 trial with large sample size had low loss to follow-up, less than 10%.

 B A C K G R O U N D
Vaginal birth can cause tears to the vagina and perineum. Esti-
mates of the frequency vary, with some estimates (that include
episiotomy) indicating this occurs in 85% of births (Kettle 2008),
compared with a more recent retrospective cohort reporting that
4% of 1785 Australian women sustained a perineal scrape and
34%sustainedafirst-orsecond-degree perineal tear(Catling-Paull
2013). While minor tears may heal quickly without intervention,
some are more severe, damaging tissue, muscle and sometimes ex-
tending to the anal sphincter. These more severe tears need surgi-
cal repair, and depending on the extent, may cause a number of
problems in the early postnatal period. Women may experience
pain, bleeding, infection, dyspareunia (pain during sexual inter-
course), and have a prolonged hospital stay. In a small percent-
age of women, the damage to the vaginal and perineal tissues can
result in some long-term problems such as pain, urinary fistula
(an abnormal connection between vagina and bladder), urinary
incontinence (the inability of control causing urinary ’accidents’),
rectal fistula (an abnormal connection between the vagina and rec-
tum), faecal incontinence (the inability of control causing faecal
’accidents’), dyspareunia and genital-urinary prolapse (the pelvic
organs descending from their normal position) (Kettle 2008).
Tearsof the perineumandvaginaare classifiedasfollows(Fernando
2006):
• first degree: involving the fourchette, perineal skin and
vaginal mucous membrane, but not the underlying fascia and
muscle;
• second degree: involving the perineal muscles and skin;
• third degree: injury to the anal sphincter complex;
◦ 3a: less than 50% of the external anal sphincter torn;
◦ 3b: 50% of the external anal sphincter torn; and
◦ 3c: injury to the external and internal anal sphincter;
• fourth degree: injury extends through the anal sphincter
complex to anal epithelium.
Severe perineal trauma usually refers to a third-degree or fourth-
degree tear (Priddis 2013; RCOG 2007).
Episiotomy, a surgical cut of the vagina and perineum, is some-
times used in an attempt to prevent serious perineal damage caused
by tearing and to facilitate the birth of the baby.
Description of the intervention
Episiotomy is a surgical incision of the vagina and perineum car-
ried out by a skilled birth attendant to enlarge the vaginal open-
ing (FIGO 2012). The first documented episiotomy dates back
to over 270 years ago (Ould 1741). Rates of episiotomy increased
substantially during the first half of the 20th century. At that time,
there was an increasing move for women to give birth in a hospital
and for physicians to manage normal uncomplicated childbirths.
Since then, episiotomy has become one of the most commonly
performed surgical procedures in the world (Graham 1997). Re-
ported rates of episiotomies vary from as low as 9.7% (Sweden)
to as high as 100% (Taiwan) (Graham 2005). The large differ-
ences in episiotomy rates closely relate to the differences in poli-
cies regarding the use of episiotomy. Episiotomy rates are high in
some countries, such as Argentina and China, with a policy of
routine use of episiotomy for nearly all first births (Lede 1991;
Qian 2001). Other places adopt a policy of ’selective’ use of epi-
siotomy where the use of episiotomy is restricted rather than uni-
versally performed - clinicians use their clinical judgement to de-
termine the need for episiotomy where the benefits likely outweigh
the harms in situations such as impending severe perineal tear,
prolonged second stage of labour, shoulder dystocia, instrumental
delivery, and non-reassuring fetal heart rate (ACOG 2006; Melo
2014). In the USA, the episiotomy rate decreased from 60.9% in
1979 to 24.5% in 2004 (Frankman 2009). In Finland, the epi-
siotomy rate decreased from 71.5% to 54.9% between 1997 to
1999 and 2006 to 2007 among primiparous women, and from
21.5% to 9.2% between 1997 to 2001 and 2006 to 2007 among
multiparous women (Räisänen 2011).
Episiotomy is made with scissors or scalpel and requires repair by
suturing (Thacker 1983). There are seven ways of performing an
episiotomy, with ’midline’ and ’mediolateral’ being the two main
types of episiotomy in the literature and medical practice (Kalis
2012). A midline (sometimes called ’median’) episiotomy is “a
vertical incision from the posterior fourchette and runs along the
midline through the central tendon of the perineal body” (Kalis
2012). Critics point out that if a midline episiotomy extends, it is
likely to extend into the anal sphincter causing a third- or fourth-
degree tear. A mediolateral episiotomy is “an incision beginning
in the midline and directed laterally and downwards away from
the rectum” (Kalis 2012). In theory, if a mediolateral tear extends,
it will extend away from the anal sphincter. An episiotomy is gen-
erally done late in second stage when the perineum is stretched
thin. Prior to the incision, local anaesthesia is injected to numb the
perineum, if a mother does not have regional anaesthesia (ACOG
2006).
How the intervention might work
It is thought that enlarging the vaginal outlet by episiotomy would
reduce vaginal soft tissue stretching and tension during child-
birth, thereby preventing higher degrees of perineal traumas and
their subsequent complications (Cunningham 1993; Ould 1741;
Thacker 1983). More space also allows for instrumentation of
assisted deliveries by forceps or vacuums (Cargill 2004; Murphy
2008a). At other times, episiotomy is performed to shorten sec-

 ond stage of labour for various maternal and fetal indications
(Hamilton 1861; Hartmann 2005) such as maternal exhaustion
and fetal bradycardia.
Clinicians who advocate routine episiotomies reason that perineal
tears, including severe tears, can occur in women who are not
thought likely to have serious tears and who have not had an epi-
siotomy under a selective regimen. However, the effectiveness of
routine episiotomy preventing severe perineal trauma has been
questioned and the procedure has its own associated complica-
tions. Since not all vaginal births result in perineal trauma, some
women are subjected to unnecessary incisions and their associated
complications and morbidity as a result of a ’routine’ episiotomy
policy. Even in obstetrical emergencies such as shoulder dysto-
cia, and in instrumental-assisted deliveries, episiotomy may not
reduce severe perineal tears (Steiner 2012). Complications associ-
ated with episiotomy include bleeding, pain and discomfort of the
wound and sutures (which may cause pain while sitting, and in
turn affect breastfeeding), wound scarring, dyspareunia, or com-
plications in subsequent vaginal births. Other adverse effects of
episiotomy include: (a) extension of episiotomy through the anal
sphincter and rectum by the clinician making the incision, or by
spontaneous extension of the incision; (b) unsatisfactory anatomic
healing resulting in skin tags, asymmetry or excessive narrowing
of the introitus, vaginal prolapse, recto-vaginal fistula and fistula-
in-ano (Homsi 1994); (c) increased blood loss and hematoma; (d)
pain and oedema around the episiotomy wound; (e) infection and
dehiscence (Homsi 1994); (f) dyspareunia, which may be a short-
term consequence, or may become more established and cause
persistent dyspareunia (Garner 1982); and finally, (h) at least one
woman has died as a result of infection complicating an episiotomy
wound (Lynch 1997).
Why it is important to do this review
Given the wide use of episiotomy globally and questions on its
benefits and harms, it is important to provide solid evidence to
inform the appropriate clinical practice and to ensure the well-
being of women and their infants. This review aims to evaluate
the evidence of selective versus routine use of episiotomy. To help
our thinking on this, we developed a diagram to summarise the
rationale commonly used to justify routine episiotomy (Figure
1). We used the outcomes identified in this diagram to evaluate
research evidence of whether this rationale is justified.

Criteria for considering studies for this review
Types of studies
Randomised controlled trials (RCT). Cluster-RCTs would have
been eligible for inclusion in this review but none were identified.
Quasi-RCTs, trials using a cross-over design or those published in
abstract form only were not eligible for inclusion in this review. We
included trials where spontaneous or instrumental vaginal births
were intended.
Types of participants
Pregnant women having normal or assisted vaginal births.
Types of interventions
We compared a policy of performing episiotomy only if needed
(’selective’, intervention group) with routine episiotomy (control
group).
Types of outcome measures
Main outcomes
• Severe perineal/vaginal trauma. This was perineal trauma,
with or without severe vaginal trauma, and included third- or
fourth-degree trauma
• Blood loss at delivery
• Newborn Apgar score less than seven at five minutes
• Perineal infection
• Moderate or severe pain (assessed using a standardised
quantitative scale, such as ’visual analogue scale’)
• Long-term dyspareunia (defined as dyspareunia at least six
months after delivery)
• Long-term effects (defined as trauma at least six months
after delivery, including urinary fistula, urinary incontinence,
genital prolapse, rectal fistula, faecal incontinence and genital
prolapse)
Other outcomes
• Need for perineal suturing (excluding episiotomy repair)
• Admission to special care baby unit
• Days in hospital after birth
• Breastfeeding (initiation of breastfeeding, exclusive
breastfeeding on discharge from hospital)
• Satisfaction (assessed using a standardised scale)
Search methods for identification of studies
The following methods section of this review was based on a stan-
dard template used by Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth.
Electronic searches
We searched Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth’s Trials Register
by contacting their Information Specialist (14 September 2016).
The Register is a database containing over 22,000 reports of con-
trolledtrialsinthe fieldof pregnancyandchildbirth.Forfull search
methods used to populate Pregnancy and Childbirth’s Trials Regis-
ter, including the detailed search strategies for CENTRAL, MED-
LINE, Embase and CINAHL; the list of handsearched journals
and conference proceedings, and the list of journals reviewed via
the current awareness service, please follow this link to the edi-
torial information about the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth
in the Cochrane Library and select the ‘Specialized Register’ sec-
tion from the options on the left side of the screen.
Briefly, Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth’s Trials Register is
maintained by their Information Specialist and contains trials
identified from:
1. monthly searches of the Cochrane Central Register of
Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in the Cochrane Library;
2. weekly searches of MEDLINE (Ovid);
3. weekly searches of Embase (Ovid);
4. monthly searches of CINAHL (EBSCO);
5. handsearches of 30 journals and the proceedings of major
conferences;
6. weekly current awareness alerts for a further 44 journals
plus monthly BioMed Central email alerts.
Search results are screened by two people and the full text of all
relevant trial reports identified through the searching activities de-
scribed above is reviewed. Based on the intervention described,
each trial report is assigned a number that corresponds to a spe-
cific Pregnancy and Childbirth review topic (or topics), and is
then added to the Register. The Information Specialist searches
the Register for each review using this topic number rather than
keywords. This results in a more specific search set which has
been fully accounted for in the relevant review sections (Included
studies; Excluded studies; Ongoing studies).

 Searching other resources
We searched the reference lists of retrieved studies.
We did not apply any language or date restrictions.
Data collection and analysis
This extensively updated version of the review is based on an up-
dated protocol, revised outcomes and use of new Cochrane meth-
ods, including risk of bias assessment and GRADE. All previously
included trials had the inclusion criteria, assessment of risk of bias,
and data re-extracted.
Selection of studies
Two review authors independently assessed for inclusion all the
potential studies we identified as a result of the search strategy.
The inclusion criteria for studies in the final analysis included: the
study was an RCT; it compared selective with routine episiotomy;
andwasfull text. We resolvedanydisagreementthrough discussion
or, if required, we consulted with the other experienced review
authors in the team.
We created a study flow diagram to map out the number of records
identified, included and excluded (Liberati 2009).
Data extraction and management
We designed a form to extract data. For eligible studies, (Hong
Jiang, Xu Qian) review authors extracted the data using the agreed
form. We resolved discrepancies through discussion or, in some
conditions, we consulted Paul Garner (PG) and Guillermo Car-
roli (GC). We entered data into Review Manager 5 (RevMan 5)
software (RevMan 2014) and checked them for accuracy.
When information regarding any of the above was unclear, we
attempted to contact authors of the original reports to provide
further details.
In the description of studies we were aware that the degree of
trauma was classified differently between studies, and in some
might not be well defined. We reassessed the appropriateness of
the categories based on the standard ’degree scale’ and mapped the
trial outcomes on to these categories.
We described length of follow-up for all our pre-specified out-
comes. These data are presented in the Characteristics of included
studies tables. However, in our results we only reported on longer-
term outcomes as specified in the protocol.
For patient-reported outcomes, we recorded the method used,
whether the questionnaire was by interview or self-completed. For
pain we sought for exact words used by the researchers to evaluate
the degree of pain by functional impairment wherever possible.
GC was the principal investigator on a large trial included in this
review. Risk of bias assessment and data extraction were carried
out by authors independent of GC. PG provided oversight on data
extraction from this trial and on interpretation of its findings on
account of this potential conflict of interest.
Assessment of risk of bias in included studies
Two review authors independently assessed risk of bias for each
study using the criteria outlined in the Cochrane Handbook for
Systematic Reviews of Interventions (the Handbook) (Higgins 2011).
Any disagreement was resolved by discussion or by involving a
third assessor.
(1) Random sequence generation
We described for each included study the method used to generate
the allocation sequence in sufficient detail to allow an assessment
of whether it should produce comparable groups. We assessed the
method as:
• low risk of bias (any truly random process, for example,
random number table; computer random number generator);
• high risk of bias (any non-random process, for example,
odd or even date of birth; hospital or clinic record number);
• unclear risk of bias.
(2) Allocation concealment
We described for each included study the method used to con-
ceal allocation to interventions prior to assignment and assessed
whether intervention allocation could have been foreseen in ad-
vance of, or during recruitment, or changed after assignment. We
assessed the methods as:
• low risk of bias (for example, telephone or central
randomisation; consecutively numbered sealed opaque
envelopes);
• high risk of bias (open random allocation; unsealed or non-
opaque envelopes, alternation; date of birth);
• unclear risk of bias.
(3.1) Blinding of participants and personnel (checking for
possible performance bias)
We described for each included study the methods used, if any, to
blind study participants and personnel from knowledge of which
intervention a participant received. We considered that studies
were at low risk of bias if they were blinded, or if we judged that
the lack of blinding would be unlikely to affect results. We assessed
blinding separately for different outcomes or classes of outcomes.
We assessed the methods as:
• low, high or unclear risk of bias for participants;
• low, high or unclear risk of bias for personnel.

Cochrane Collaboration.
 (3.2) Blinding of outcome assessment (checking for possible
detection bias)
We described for each included study the methods used, if any, to
blind outcome assessors from knowledge of which intervention a
participant received. We assessed blinding separately for different
outcomes or classes of outcomes.
We assessed methods used to blind outcome assessment as:
• low, high or unclear risk of bias.
(4) Incomplete outcome data (checking for possible attrition
bias due to the amount, nature and handling of incomplete
outcome data)
We described for each included study, and for each outcome or
class of outcomes, the completeness of data including attrition and
exclusions from the analysis. We stated whether attrition and ex-
clusions were reported and the numbers included in the analysis at
each stage (compared with the total randomised participants), rea-
sons for attrition or exclusion where reported, and whether miss-
ing data were balanced across groups or were related to outcomes.
We assessed methods as:
• low risk of bias (for example no missing outcome data;
missing outcome data balanced across groups);
• high risk of bias (for example numbers or reasons for
missing data imbalanced across groups; ’as-treated’ analysis done
with substantial departure of intervention received from that
assigned at randomisation);
• unclear risk of bias.
(5) Selective reporting (checking for reporting bias)
We described for each included study how we investigated the
possibility of selective outcome reporting bias and what we found.
We assessed the methods as:
• low risk of bias (where it was clear that all of the study’s pre-
specified outcomes and all expected outcomes of interest to the
review were reported);
• high risk of bias (where not all the study’s pre-specified
outcomes were reported; one or more reported primary
outcomes were not pre-specified; outcomes of interest were
reported incompletely and so could not be used; or the study
failed to include results of a key outcome that would have been
expected to have been reported);
• unclear risk of bias (insufficient information to permit
judgement of ’low risk’ or ’high risk’.
(6) Other bias (checking for bias due to problems not
covered by above points)
We described for each included study any important concerns we
have about other possible sources of bias. We assessed whether
each study was free of other problems that could put it at risk of
bias:
• low risk of other bias;
• high risk of other bias;
• unclear whether there was risk of other bias.
(7) Overall risk of bias
We made explicit judgements about whether studies were at high
risk of bias, according to the criteria given in the Cochrane Hand-
book for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Higgins 2011). With
reference to the above points, we assessed the likely magnitude and
direction of the bias and whether we considered it was likely to
impact on the findings. We explored the impact of the level of bias
through undertaking sensitivity analyses - see Sensitivity analysis.
Assessment of the certainty of the evidence using the
GRADE approach
We used GRADE to assess the evidence for our main comparison
of selective versus routine episiotomy. We assessed the following
outcomes for the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE
approach (Guyatt 2008; GRADE Working Group 2009).
• Severe perineal/vaginal trauma. This was perineal trauma,
with or without severe vaginal trauma, and included third- or
fourth-degree trauma
• Blood loss at delivery
• Newborn Apgar score less than seven at five minutes
• Perineal infection
• Moderate or severe pain (assessed using a standardised
quantitative scale, such as a ’visual analogue scale’)
• Long-term dyspareunia (defined as dyspareunia at least six
months after delivery)
• Long-term effects (defined as of trauma at least six months
after delivery, including: urinary fistula, urinary incontinence,
genital prolapse, rectal fistula, and faecal incontinence)*
(*In order to confine the number of outcomes in Summary of
findings for the main comparison to seven (the maximum recom-
mended) we asked midwives to prioritise long-term effects out-
comes. In the table we have set out findings for urinary inconti-
nence; where reported, for other long-term effects we graded the
certainty of the evidence and have presented findings in the text.)
We used the GRADEpro Guideline Development Tool to import
data from RevMan 5 (RevMan 2014) in order to create ’Sum-
mary of findings’ tables. We produced a summary of the inter-
vention effect and a measure of the certainty of the evidence for
each of the above outcomes using the GRADE approach (Guyatt
2008; GRADE Working Group 2009). The GRADE approach
uses five considerations (study limitations, consistency of effect,
imprecision, indirectness and publication bias) to assess the qual-
ity of the body of evidence for each outcome. The evidence was
downgraded from ’high’ by one level for serious (or by two levels
for very serious) limitations, depending on assessments for risk of
bias, indirectness of evidence, serious inconsistency, imprecision
of effect estimates or potential publication bias.

 Measures of treatment effect
Dichotomous data
For dichotomous data, we presented results as summary risk ratio
(RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI).
Continuous data
For continuous data, we used the mean difference (MD) if out-
comes were measured in the same way between trials. We used
the standardised mean difference (SMD) to combine trials that
measured the same outcome, but used different methods.
Unit of analysis issues
Cluster-randomised trials
We did not identify any cluster-randomised trials for inclusion in
this review. In future updates, if we identify any such trials for
inclusion we will utilise appropriate methods as per the Cochrane
Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions.
Studies with more than two treatment arms
None of the included studies had more than two treatment arms.
Infuture updates,ifwe identifyanystudiesfor inclusion with more
than two treatment arms we will utilise appropriate methods as
per the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions.
Dealing with missing data
For included studies, we documented levels of attrition. We ex-
plored the impact of including studies with high levels of missing
data in the overall assessment of treatment effect by using sensi-
tivity analysis. For all outcomes, we carried out analyses, as far as
possible, on an intention-to-treat basis, that is, we attempted to
include all participants randomised to each group in the analyses,
and all participants were analysed in the group to which they were
allocated, regardless of whether or not they received the allocated
intervention. The denominator for each outcome in each trial was
the number randomised minus any participants whose outcomes
were known to be missing.
Assessment of heterogeneity
We assessed statistical heterogeneity in each meta-analysis using
the T², I² (Higgins 2003) and Chi² statistics. We regarded hetero-
geneity as moderate if I² was greater than 30% and either T² was
greater than zero, or there was a low P value (less than 0.05) in the
Chi² test for heterogeneity; and substantial if I² was greater than
50%.
Assessment of reporting biases
If there were 10 or more studies in the meta-analysis we inves-
tigated reporting biases (such as publication bias) using funnel
plots. We assessed funnel plot asymmetry visually. If asymmetry
was suggested by a visual assessment, we performed exploratory
analyses to investigate it.
Data synthesis
We reported adherence to the allocated groups and recorded epi-
siotomy rates in both groups. We conducted analysis by intention
to treat. We carried out statistical analysis using the RevMan 5
software (RevMan 2014). We used fixed-effect meta-analysis for
combining data where it was reasonable to assume that studies
were estimating the same underlying intervention effect: that is,
where trials were examining the same intervention, and the tri-
als’ populations and methods were judged sufficiently similar. If
there was clinical heterogeneity sufficient to expect that the un-
derlying treatment effects differed between trials, or if substantial
statistical heterogeneity was detected (greater than 50%), we used
both fixed-effect and random-effects meta-analysis to produce an
overall summary of an average treatment effect. The random-ef-
fects summary was treated as the average of the range of possi-
ble treatment effects and we discussed the clinical implications of
treatment effects differing between trials. If the average treatment
effect was not clinically meaningful we did not combine trials. If
we used random-effects analyses, the result was presented as the
average treatment effect with 95% confidence intervals, and the
estimates of T² and I².
We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence for all the
main outcomes.
Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity
Where we identified substantial heterogeneity, we used subgroup
analyses and sensitivity analyses. We also considered whether an
overall summary was meaningful, and if it was, we used random-
effects analysis to produce it.
We conducted the main analysis around studies where instrumen-
tal birth was not anticipated. There was one trial where instru-
mental birth was anticipated, and this was included as a separate
comparison, as it is a different clinical group, and the outcomes
may be different; furthermore there are additional trials being car-
ried out in this area suggesting some degree of clinical equipoise
and a clearly defined separate clinical question.
Irrespective of the absence or presence of heterogeneity, we carried
out a subgroup analysis by parity (primiparous and multiparous)
and type of episiotomy (midline and mediolateral).
We assessed subgroup differences by interaction tests available
within RevMan 5 (RevMan 2014). We reported the results of
subgroup analyses quoting the Chi2 statistic and P value, and the
interaction test I² value, if there were sufficient data to make these
analyses valid.

 Included studies
The search identified 29 studies, of which 12 were included (Ali
2004; Belizan 1993; Dannecker 2004; Eltorkey 1994; Harrison
1984; House 1986; Juste-Pina 2007; Klein 1992; Murphy 2008b;
Rodriguez 2008; Sleep 1984; Sulaiman 2013).
Design
All 12 trials were individually randomised.
Setting
Ten of the included 12 studies were carried out between July 1982
and October 2009 (Ali 2004; Belizan 1993; Dannecker 2004;
Eltorkey 1994; Harrison 1984; Juste-Pina 2007; Klein 1992;
Murphy 2008b; Rodriguez 2008; Sulaiman 2013). Two studies
did not describe when the studies took place (House 1986; Sleep
1984). Seven of the 11 studies were carried out in high-income
countries, including Canada (Klein 1992), Germany (Dannecker
2004), Ireland (Harrison 1984), Spain (Juste-Pina 2007), and the
UK (House 1986; Murphy 2008b; Sleep 1984). Five of the studies
were conducted in middle- and low-income countries, and these
included Argentina (Belizan 1993), Columbia (Rodriguez 2008),
Malaysia (Sulaiman 2013), Pakistan (Ali 2004), and Saudi Arabia
(Eltorkey 1994).
Five studies were carried out in university teaching hospitals,
relatively high complexity care institutions (Dannecker 2004;
Juste-Pina 2007; Klein 1992; Rodriguez 2008; Sulaiman 2013).
One of these five studies also recruited some of participants from
a mid-complexity level hospital (Rodriguez 2008). The remain-
ing seven studies were conducted in maternity units with inad-
equate information to judge the institution’s level of care (Ali
2004; Belizan 1993; Eltorkey 1994; Harrison 1984; House 1986;
Murphy 2008b; Sleep 1984).
One trial (Ali2004) stated that there was no severe perineal trauma
in either selective or routine episiotomy group. However, the main
table reported 100% severe perineal trauma in both groups. We
have assumed the results are as stated in the abstract but have
written to the study authors for clarification.
Sample sizes
Overall, the sample sizes in the included studies ranged from 109
(Dannecker 2004; 146randomisedbutdataforonly109reported)
to 2606 (Belizan 1993). Two trials (Belizan 1993; Sleep 1984) had
a sample size of 1000 or above; one trial (Klein 1992) involved
more than 500 women and the remaining eight studies involved
between 100 and 500 women.
Participants
The participants in the included studies were pregnant women
(above 16 years old), between 28 gestational weeks and full term,
with a live singleton fetus, and had vaginal birth. The women did
not have severe medical or psychiatric conditions.
The gravidity of the trial participants is summarised in Table
1. Eight trials included primiparous women only (Ali 2004;
Dannecker 2004; Eltorkey1994; Harrison 1984; Juste-Pina 2007;
Murphy 2008b; Rodriguez 2008; Sulaiman 2013), and the other
four included both primiparous and multiparous women (Belizan
1993; House 1986; Klein 1992; Sleep 1984).
In 11 studies randomisation was done during labour, and in one
study (Dannecker 2004) there was no description.
Interventions and comparisons
In all but one of the trials vaginal births without complications
were anticipated; the Murphy 2008b study, which only recruited
women where operative vaginal delivery was anticipated at the
start of labour. The Murphy 2008b study was included, but data
are reported separately.
Location
The indication for selective episiotomy was specified differently in
the various studies, although overall related to both fetal or ma-
ternal indications. Seven trials performed selective episiotomy to
avoid either severe perineal tear or fetal distress (Ali 2004; Belizan
1993; Eltorkey 1994; Juste-Pina 2007; Klein 1992; Rodriguez
2008; Sulaiman 2013). Two studies only conducted the selective
episiotomy for fetal reasons (Dannecker 2004; Sleep 1984). Two
studies carried out selective episiotomy mainly to prevent lacera-
tion (Harrison 1984; House 1986). One study provided the selec-
tive episiotomy to avoid severe perineal tear at operative vaginal
delivery (Murphy 2008b).
Ten trials utilised mediolateral episiotomies (Ali 2004; Belizan
1993; Dannecker 2004; Eltorkey 1994; Harrison 1984; House
1986; Juste-Pina 2007; Murphy 2008b; Sleep 1984; Sulaiman
2013) and two trials used midline episiotomies (Klein 1992;
Rodriguez 2008).
Episiotomy rates
The actual episiotomy rates are described in Table 2. Rates in the
selective arm ranged from 8% to 59% with a median of 32%, in
the routine arm rates ranged from 100% in four studies through
to 51%, with a median of 83%.
The difference within trials between the selective and the routine
episiotomy groups ranged from 21% to 92% more episiotomies
in the control arm.

Cochrane Collaboration.
 Operative delivery rates
The operative delivery rate in the selective arm ranged from
1% (Rodriguez 2008) to 8% (Dannecker 2004), median of 4%
(Eltorkey 1994) (Table 3). In the comparator, routine arm rates
ranged from 2% in two studies (Belizan 1993; Rodriguez 2008),
through to 15% (Dannecker 2004), with a median of 5%. All trials
included these operative deliveries in their reporting of outcomes.
Outcomes
Length of follow up is described in Table 1. Three trials only
reported on outcomes in the immediate postnatal period (under
one month); a further three trials reported outcomes in the short
term(uptosixmonths); fourstudiesreportedonlong-termfollow-
up (beyond six months). An additional study included follow-up
beyond six months, but only reported the mean time of follow-
up which would include women followed-up for a shorter period
(Dannecker 2004).
At discharge (immediately postpartum up to discharge from
the hospital)
Severe perineal/vaginal trauma (review primary outcome) was re-
ported in all studies. We compared our definition and the trial
definitions (Table 4). All the trials described third and fourth de-
gree tears as in the standard definition, and one trial (Sleep 1984)
specifically mentioned upper vaginal tear in the definition.
The need for perineal suturing was reported in six trials (Ali 2004;
Belizan 1993; Eltorkey 1994; Harrison 1984; House 1986; Sleep
1984).
Blood loss at delivery was reported in two trials (House 1986;
Sulaiman 2013).
Newborn Apgar scores at five minutes were reported in two trials
(Dannecker 2004; Juste-Pina 2007).
Admission to special care baby unit was reported in five trials (
Eltorkey1994; Juste-Pina 2007; Klein1992; Sleep1984; Sulaiman
2013).
Perineal infection was reported in two trials at three days postpar-
tum (House 1986) and seven days postpartum (Belizan 1993).
Pain assessed using a visual analogue scale was reported by three
trials (Dannecker 2004; House 1986; Klein 1992). Moderate or
severe pain by visual analogue scale was only reported in one trial at
three days postpartum (House 1986). Another two trials presented
pain using scores, analysed as a continuous variable (Dannecker
2004; Klein 1992) (Table 5). A number of trials reported pain
at different time points (any measure), for example, at hospital
puerperium(Juste-Pina 2007), atdaysone, twoand10postpartum
(Klein 1992), seven days postpartum (Belizan 1993), or at 10 days
postpartum (Sleep 1984).
For the outcomes of days in hospital, initiation and exclusive
breastfeeding, and satisfaction with the experience of childbirth,
results were not reported in any of the included studies.
Short term (at least one month and less than six months)
Three trials reported dyspareunia (Dannecker 2004; Juste-Pina
2007; Sleep 1984). Two of them collected the data through ques-
tionnaire survey (Dannecker 2004; Sleep 1984) and one through
telephone interview (Juste-Pina 2007). The parameters measured
relating to dyspareunia included “pain during sex in the last
four weeks” (Dannecker 2004), “dyspareunia” (Juste-Pina 2007;
Sleep 1984), “pain with coitus” (Juste-Pina 2007), “ever suffering
painful sexual intercourse” (Sleep 1984). Two trials reported short-
term dyspareunia at three months postpartum (Juste-Pina 2007;
Sleep 1984) (Table 6).
Four trials reported urinary incontinence (Dannecker 2004;
Juste-Pina 2007; Klein 1992; Sleep 1984). Three of them col-
lected the data through questionnaire survey (Dannecker 2004;
Klein 1992; Sleep 1984) and one through telephone interview
(Juste-Pina 2007). The parameters measured included “reported
urinary incontinence” and agreement/disagreement with the state-
ment “leak urine involuntarily” (Table 7). Short-term urinary in-
continence was reported by two studies at three months postpar-
tum (Klein 1992; Sleep 1984).
Long term (six months or more)
Long-term dyspareunia and urinary incontinence was reported in
three trials at two time points, at the mean time of 7.3 months
postpartum (Dannecker 2004), and three years after childbirth
(Juste-Pina 2007; Sleep 1984) (Table 6, Table 7). Genital prolapse
was reported by one trial at three years postpartum (Juste-Pina
2007).
Murphy 2008b, who evaluated women with anticipated operative
vaginal delivery, also reported incontinence of urine and faeces at
one year.
There were a number of outcomes in the trial reports that were
not listed in our protocol. Anterior trauma was reported by eight
trials (Belizan 1993; Dannecker 2004; Eltorkey 1994; Juste-Pina
2007; Klein 1992; Rodriguez 2008; Sleep 1984; Sulaiman 2013).
One study reported haematoma and wound dehiscence (Belizan
1993), and another one reported bulging (Klein 1992).
Excluded studies
We excluded a total of 16 studies (Amorim 2015; Coats 1980;
Detlefsen 1980; Dong 2004; El-Din 2014; Golmakani 2011;
Henriksen 1992; Islam 2013; Javed 2007; Karbanova 2013; Moini
2009; Roy 2015; Sawant 2015; Shembekar 2009; Swift 2014;
Werner 1991).
For details of excluded studies, see table of Characteristics of
excluded studies. The main reason for exclusion (12 studies) was
that studies did not compare selective versus routine use of epi-
siotomy; rather they compared policies of no episiotomy versus
selective episiotomy or different techniques for carrying out epi-
siotomy (Amorim 2015; Detlefsen 1980; Dong 2004; El-Din

2015; Sawant 2015; Swift 2014; Werner 1991). Two studies were
quasi-randomised trials (Coats 1980; Henriksen 1992). Finally,
two studies published as abstracts included too little information
on methods and results to allow assessment of risk of bias or to
interpret results (Golmakani 2011; Shembekar 2009).

 Allocation
Two of the studies reported an adequate method of producing ran-
domisation (Belizan 1993; Murphy 2008b) including both ran-
dom sequence generation and allocation concealment - we assessed
these studies as low risk of bias for selection bias.
Eight studies only reported adequate random sequence gener-
ation (Rodriguez 2008) or allocation concealment (Ali 2004;
Dannecker 2004; Eltorkey 1994; House 1986; Klein 1992; Sleep
1984; Sulaiman 2013). Consequently, Rodriguez 2008 was as-
sessed as low risk of bias for sequence generation and unclear
risk of bias for allocation concealment and Ali 2004; Dannecker
2004; Eltorkey 1994; House 1986; Klein 1992; Sleep 1984; and
Sulaiman 2013 were assessed as unclear risk of bias for random se-
quence generation and low risk of bias for allocation concealment.
Two studies reported neither the procedure of randomisation nor
allocation concealment (Harrison 1984; Juste-Pina 2007) and
these were assessed as having an unclear risk of selection bias.
Blinding
Blinding of participants or observer was only mentioned in three
studies (Belizan 1993; House 1986; Sleep 1984). In the remaining
studies blinding of participants and personnel was judged as un-
clear (Ali 2004; Dannecker 2004; Eltorkey 1994; Harrison 1984;
Juste-Pina 2007; Klein 1992; Murphy 2008b; Rodriguez 2008;
Sulaiman 2013).
In the House 1986 trial, participants were blinded to the group
assignments, judged as low risk of performance bias and unclear
risk of detection bias. In the Sleep 1984 trial, the observer was
reported to be blind to treatment assignments when measuring
the outcomes at 10 days after the birth and maternal reports of
perineal discomfort three months after the birth. However, there
was not enough information to judge how blinding was carried out
or whether blinding was used in other outcome assessment. So the
study was judged as unclear for risk of performance and detection
bias. In the Belizan 1993 trial the assessment of the healing and
morbidity outcomes were blinded to the observer, judged as low
risk of detection bias and unclear bias of performance bias.
None of the other studies (Ali 2004; Dannecker 2004; Eltorkey
1994; Harrison 1984; Juste-Pina 2007; Klein 1992; Murphy
2008b; Rodriguez 2008; Sulaiman 2013) clearly reported blind-
ing, and were judged as unclear risk of performance and detection
biases.
Incomplete outcome data
Sleep 1984 and Dannecker 2004 included long-term follow-up,
with a loss to follow-up of about 33% and 40% of the participants
respectively. Klein 1992 showed a loss to follow-up rate around
1% at birth and three months postpartum. In the Belizan 1993
trial the total number of women randomised was included in the
analysis of the primary outcome with a 5% loss to follow-up at
the time of the birth, 7% at postnatal discharge and 57% at seven
months postpartum. In the study by Juste-Pina 2007, the loss
to follow-up was around 4% during hospital puerperium, 5% at
three months postpartum, and 9% three years after childbirth.
In the study by Murphy 2008b, the rate of follow-up was 92%
at first/second day after childbirth, and 83% six weeks postnatal.
Intention-to-treat analysis was performed in all of the studies.
In one study, data were not reported by randomisation group and
we judged it as high risk of bias due to incomplete outcome data
(Harrison 1984). One trial was assessed as high risk because of
the high rate of loss of follow-up for long-term outcomes (Belizan
1993). Another study was also assessed as high risk as there was
no description of loss to follow-up, and there appeared to be a
differential loss to follow-up (at 7th day postpartum, 19 women
were lost from the selective group, and 12 from the routine group
(Ali 2004)). Two trials were judged to be low risk due to the
low rate of loss to follow-up (Klein 1992; Juste-Pina 2007). One
study did not have any missing data and was judged to be at low
risk of attrition bias (Sulaiman 2013). For the remaining six trials
attrition bias was judged as unclear (Dannecker 2004; Eltorkey
1994; House 1986; Murphy 2008b; Rodriguez 2008; Sleep1984).
Selective reporting
The included studies appeared to report all outcomes as intended.
However, there was not enough information to fully assess the
potential for reporting bias so we have judged all included studies
as being at an unclear risk of bias for this domain.
Other potential sources of bias
Since there was no fully reported information, this was judged as
unclear risk of bias for all included studies.
Effects of interventions

A total of 6352participantsin12trialswere includedinthisreview.
Eleven trials with a total of 6177 participants examined selective
versus routine use of episiotomy in births where a non-operative
vaginal delivery was anticipated. One trial with 175 participants
(Murphy 2008b) was conducted in women where an operative
vaginal delivery was anticipated and performed. This study was
analysed independently (comparison B, analysis 4) and presented
at the end of the main results.

 Comparison A. Selective versus routine use of
episiotomy (analysis 1)
See Summary of findings for the main comparison. All data are
includedinthisanalysis, includingall women irrespective of parity.
All eleven trials included in this comparison reported episiotomy
rates. Event rates in both selective and routine episiotomy groups
varied considerably between trials (Table 2).
Main outcomes
Severe perineal/vaginal trauma
While all 11 trials reported this outcome, only eight of the trials
contributed estimable data to the meta-analysis; overall, there was
a 30% reduction in severe perineal/vaginal trauma (risk ratio (RR)
0.70, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.52 to 0.94; 5375 women; 8
trials; I2 = 37%; low-certainty evidence (Analysis 1.1). There was
moderate quantitative heterogeneity in the analysis.
To explore possible explanations for heterogeneity, we conducted
a single subgroup analysis, by the degree of success of implement-
ing the policies. In trials where the difference in episiotomy rates
between selective and routine groups was less than 30%, there was
no obvious difference in outcome. In trials where the difference
in the rate was greater than 30%, there was a clear effect on severe
vaginal/perineal trauma (RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.81; 4877
women, 7 contributing trials; I2 = 21%).
We carried out a sensitivity analysis only including trials with ade-
quate allocation concealment. The estimate was similar, although
the point estimate of the difference was less marked (RR 0.87,
95% CI 0.61 to 1.25; 4949 participants, 7 trials). When we only
included studies with low risk of bias for follow-up, only two trials
contributed and the analysis was not informative.
Visual assessment of the funnel plot suggests possible publication
bias, with small studies showing that routine episiotomy resulted
in higher rates of perineal trauma (Figure 5). This is noted in the

Cochrane Collaboration.
 Blood loss at delivery
Two trials reported estimated blood loss at delivery (House 1986,
Sulaiman 2013). One showed a marked average difference, and
the other study showed no important difference, which was ap-
parent in the statistical test for heterogeneity (T2 = 902.46; I2 =
72%). The average effect from meta-analysis was little different
(mean difference 27 mL less with selective, 95% CI 74.80 less to
20.49 more; 336 women; 2 trials; Analysis 1.3; very low-certainty
evidence).
Newborn Apgar score less than seven at five minutes
Two trials reported Apgar score less than seven at five minutes, but
there were no events in either arm in both trials (Dannecker 2004;
Juste-Pina 2007) (Analysis 1.4). With no events, it seems that
neither selective nor routine episiotomy impacts on this outcome,
and the risk difference shows narrow confidence intervals (-0.01
to +0.01%; 511 women; 2 trials; moderate-certainty evidence).
Perineal infection
Three trials reported perineal infection. Event rates were low, and
the results indicated that there may be little or no difference be-
tween the two groups in relation to this outcome (RR 0.90, 95%
CI 0.45 to 1.82; 1467 women; 3 trials; I2 = 0%; low-certainty
evidence due to imprecision) (Analysis 1.5)).
Moderate or severe perineal pain (measured using visual
analogue scale)
Three trials assessed pain using a visual analogue scale. Two re-
ported average scores, with very similar values in selective and
routine groups in both trials reporting this outcome (Table 5)
(Dannecker 2004; Klein 1992). One trial (House 1986) used the
individual women’s score to categorise by severity, and provided
an analysis on women with moderate to severe pain at day three,
not detecting a difference between the two groups (RR 0.71, 95%
CI 0.48 to 1.05, 165 women; 1 trial; low-certainty evidence due
to imprecision) (Analysis 1.6).
Other trials reported on self-reported pain in different ways, not
using an analogue scale, and thus not corresponding with our pro-
tocol, but we have summarised these data here briefly. Two tri-
als reported on ’any pain at discharge from hospital’, with fewer
women reporting pain in the selective group in one trial, and with
the other trial reporting all women, in both groups, having pain
(Analysis 1.12). One trial reported ’any pain at 10 days’, with
no clear difference detected (Analysis 1.12); three trials reported
’moderate-severe pain in first 10 days’ with no clear difference
between the two groups (RR 1.14, 95% CI 0.61 to 2.12; 1127
women; Analysis 1.12). One trial reported on ’severe and mod-
erate pain at three months’ but was underpowered and no clear
difference was evident Analysis 1.12).
Dyspareunia, long term (at least six months)
Three trials reported dyspareunia at six months or more. Two
trials did not exclude the subsequent pregnancy when assessing
at three years after (Juste-Pina 2007; Sleep 1984). There was no
clear difference between groups for this outcome (RR 1.14, 95%
CI 0.84 to 1.53; 1107 women; 3 trials; I2 = 12%; low-certainty
evidence due to inconsistency and imprecision) (Analysis 1.7).
Genital prolapse, long term (at least six months)
Only one trial reported genital prolapse at least six months or more
(three years postpartum).There was no clear difference between
the two groups (RR 0.30, 95% CI 0.06 to 1.41; 365 women; 1
trial, low-certainty evidence due to serious imprecision Analysis
1.8).
Urinary incontinence, long term (at least six months)
Three trials reported urinary incontinence at six months or more
(Dannecker 2004; Juste-Pina 2007; Sleep 1984). There was het-
erogeneity between trials (T2 = 0.07; I2 = 66%). The pooled anal-
ysis did not demonstrate a clear difference between the two groups
at six months or more postpartum (average RR 0.98, 95% CI
0.67 to 1.44; 1107 women; 3 trials; low-certainty evidence due to
inconsistency and imprecision) (Analysis 1.9).
Other important outcomes relating to long-term effects were not
reported (urinary fistula, rectal fistula, and faecal incontinence).
Other outcomes
Need for perineal suturing
Six trials reported need for perineal suturing (Ali 2004; Belizan
1993; Eltorkey 1994; Harrison 1984; House 1986; Sleep 1984).
However, the reasons for suturing were not set out in trial re-
ports, and repair of episiotomy incisions were not clearly differ-
entiated from other perineal suturing. Clearly, any woman that
had an episiotomy - either routinely or selectively - would require
suturing, Some women that had episiotomy may have required
further sutures if the incision was extended by tearing during the
birth. Two trials reported the outcome “perineal surgical repair”
(Ali 2004; Belizan 1993); in the Ali 2004 trial all women in the
routine episiotomy group had “surgical repair” while in the Belizan
1993 trial most women in this group had repair. It was not clear
whether women required any sutures over and above those needed
to repair the surgical incision. In the selective episiotomy groups
fewer women had surgical repair, but in this group it was not clear
what proportion of the women required repair of an episiotomy,
repair beyond that needed to suture any episiotomy incision, or
had non-episiotomy tears requiring sutures. Two trials reported
the outcome “required suturing” (Eltorkey 1994;Sleep 1984) and
similar issues arise regarding lack of clarity. Results do not reveal
any possible differences in the proportions of episiotomy and non-
episiotomy perineal repair in the two study groups. In the other
two trials, we have presented the number of women undergoing
perineal suturing by adding the numbers for episiotomy, second
degree tear and above (Harrison 1984; House 1986). Although for
completeness we have presented these data in Analysis 1.10, we
21

 have not pooled data as studies may have been examining different
outcomes, and within studies what was reported for the routine
and selective groups may also have differed. Overall, compared
with the routine episiotomy group, fewer women in the selective
episiotomy group required perineal suturing. However, without
clear outcome definition, findings from studies are not simple to
interpret and may be meaningless from a clinical point of view.
(The number of women undergoing episiotomy are set out inTable
2.)
Admission to neonatal special care baby unit
Five trials reported admission to neonatal special care baby unit.
Two trials had no events, whilst the highest rate was 15% overall
Juste-Pina 2007. The pooled analysis did not demonstrate a clear
difference (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.07; 2471 babies; 5 trials;
I2 = 11%; Analysis 1.11).
No data were available for the outcomes ’days in hospital after
birth’, ’breastfeeding (initiation of breastfeeding, exclusive breast-
feeding on discharge from hospital)’, and ’women’s satisfaction’.
Subgroup analysis by parity (analysis 2)
The subgroup analysis by parity included studies that randomised
only primigravida (Ali 2004; Dannecker 2004; Eltorkey 1994;
Harrison 1984; Juste-Pina 2007; Rodriguez 2008; Sulaiman 2013)
and those that recruited all parities and report the results stratified
by parity (Belizan 1993; House 1986; Klein 1992; Sleep 1984).
The analysis was only possible for one of our main outcomes:
severe perineal/vaginal trauma.
Severe perineal/vaginal trauma*
There was no evidence of subgroup differences between primi-
and multi-gravida for this outcome (test for subgroup differences:
Chi² = 0.18, df = 1 (P = 0.67), I² = 0%) (Analysis 2.1). Data for
pain assessed by visual analogue scale were not available by parity.
Subgroup analysis by type of episiotomy (analysis 3)
The subgroup analysis by type of episiotomy included studies that
used midline episiotomy (Klein 1992; Rodriguez 2008) and medi-
olateral episiotomy (Ali 2004; Belizan 1993; Dannecker 2004;
Eltorkey 1994; Harrison 1984; House 1986; Juste-Pina 2007;
Sleep 1984; Sulaiman 2013). The analysis was only possible for
one of our main outcomes: severe perineal/vaginal trauma.
Severe perineal/vaginal trauma
There was no evidence of subgroup differences between midline
and mediolateral episiotomy on severe perineal/vaginal trauma
(test for subgroup differences: Chi² = 0.28, df = 1 (P = 0.60), I² =
0%) (Analysis 3.1).
Comparison B. Selective versus routine episiotomy:
women with anticipated operative vaginal delivery
(analysis 4)
One trial was conducted among women with anticipated operative
vaginal delivery (Murphy 2008b).
Severe perineal/vaginal trauma
No clear difference was shown on the main outcome ’severe per-
ineal/vaginal trauma’ between the two groups (RR 1.30, 95% CI
0.55 to 3.07, 175 women) (Analysis 4.1).
Apgar less than seven at five minutes
The trial reported two events in each arm for Apgar less than seven
at five minutes (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.14 to 6.56, 175 women)
(Analysis 4.2).
Perineal infection
There was no clear difference on perineal infection (RR 0.47, 95%
CI 0.04 to 5.11; 175 women) (Analysis 4.3) between the two
groups.
Moderate/severe dyspareunia, long term (at least six months)
No difference was demonstrated for the outcome of moderate/
severe dyspareunia in the long term (at least six months) (RR 3.71,
95% CI 0.43 to 32.16, 108 women) (Analysis 4.4) between the
two groups.
Urinary incontinence, long term (at least six months)
No difference was shown for urinary incontinence in the long term
(at least six months) (RR 0.46, 95% CI 0.09 to 2.43, 108 women)
(Analysis 4.5) between the two groups.
There was no available data for the other main outcomes including
blood loss at delivery, moderate or severe pain (assessed using a
standardised quantitative scale, such as ’visual analogue scale’).
Other outcomes
There were no clear differences between the selective and routine
episiotomy groups on admission to special care baby unit (Analysis
4.6). Data for other outcomes including need for suturing, days
in hospital after birth, breastfeeding (initiation of breastfeeding,
exclusive breastfeedingondischarge fromhospital)andsatisfaction
(assessed using a standardised scale) were not provided.

Selective versus routine use of episiotomy for vaginal birth (Review)
Copyright © 2017 The Authors. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. on behalf of The
Cochrane Collaboration.
 Summary of main results
We included 12 trials (6177 women), 11 in women in labour for
whom a vaginal birth was intended, and one in women where an
assisted birth was anticipated. Two were large trials (more than
1000 women, from Argentina and the UK), and the rest smaller,
from Canada, Columbia, Germany, Ireland, Malaysia, Pakistan,
Saudi Arabia and Spain. Eight were only in primiparous women,
and four both primiparous and multiparous women.
For women in whom an unassisted vaginal birth was intended,
selective episiotomy resulted in less severe perineal/vaginal trauma.
Both selective and routine episiotomy seemed to have little or no
effect on Apgar less than seven at five minutes or on blood loss at
delivery.
Pain was measured with an objective scale at three days in one
study, and we do not know if selective episiotomy compared to
routine results in fewer women with moderate or severe pain; there
is probably little or no difference for long-term (at least six months)
dyspareunia and there may be little or no difference in the number
suffering from urinary incontinence from six months onwards or
other long-term effects, such as genital prolapse.
Subgroup analyses by parity showed no clear evidence of a dif-
ference between primi- and multi-gravid women. The subgroup
analysis by surgical method (midline and mediolateral) did not
detect any modifying effects.
One trial examined selective episiotomy compared to routine epi-
siotomy in women where an operative vaginal delivery was in-
tended. The results of this study with 175 women did not show
clear differences on main and other outcomes between the restric-
tive and routine use of episiotomy, but the analysis was underpow-
ered.
Overall, careful assessment of women’s pain was not well per-
formed in any of the studies. The included studies did not provide
any data relating to breastfeeding, the number of days in hospital
after birth, or women’s satisfaction.
Thus the rationale commonly used to justify routine episiotomy
(Figure 1)isnotsupportedbyanyevidence fromrandomisedtrials.
Overall completeness and applicability of
evidence
The outcomes of the review included both potential benefits and
harms. Overall, there were clear differences between groups for
severe perineal trauma but for low Apgar score at 5 minutes and
other important outcomes, with no clear differences were shown.
Long-termoutcomeswere consideredasimportant, butmeasuring
long-term outcomes is not easy and even when it is attempted
there is often high loss at follow up. Subsequent pregnancy was
not excluded from the long-term outcomes in a few studies, which
might not truly reflect the effect of selective episiotomy. Very few
good estimates of pain were available to us and none of the studies
reported women’s preferences. The studies included in the review
were carried out over a wide range of locations, including Europe,
North America, South America, and Asian countries. We have
restricted the main analysis to births where “vaginal delivery is
anticipated” rather than “operative vaginal delivery is anticipated”.
This was because we were not sure whether these results would
apply to operative vaginal delivery.
Based on the logic framework, routine episiotomy appears to offer
no advantages or benefits. Evidence in the short term is clear,
and some evidence in the long term. No data were available on
short-term indicators of hospital stay, initiation of breastfeeding,
and long-term indicators such as urinary fistula, rectal fistula and
women’s satisfaction.
Quality of the evidence
The quality of evidence for the main outcome “severe perineal/
vaginal trama” was low. The downgrading on imprecision was
because of no or few events, The downgrading on inconsistency
was due to the heterogeneity in study population for long-term
outcomes -the mix of women with or without subsequent deliv-
ery after selective episiotomy (Summary of findings for the main
comparison). The heterogeneity appeared to be explained by di-
viding trials into those where there was a clear difference in the
proportion of women receiving episiotomies between intervention
and control.
Overall, there was moderate bias in the included studies although
several studies had high risk of bias relating to incomplete outcome
data. Long-term follow up can be challenging. Some trials did
carry this out, and this is important since these long term outcomes
related to the presumed benefit of selective episiotomy (Figure
1). There was considerable loss to follow-up in some trials and it
was not easy to determine whether this might have caused bias
differentially, but the results certainly did not demonstrate any
harms of a policy of selective episiotomy.
Potential biases in the review process
We were careful to adhere to our main outcomes. We managed
conflicts of interest in relation to trialists as authors (Kliner 2014).
Agreements and disagreements with other
studies or reviews
In early 1980s, the routine use of episiotomy was questioned since
there were no supporting data to show more benefits than risks
(Banta 1982). This review has provided the evidence that routine
use of episiotomy could do harm. The main findings of this review
are consistent with the previous version of this review that also
compared selective episiotomy with routine episiotomy (Carroli
2009). Both this and the previous version of our review found that
selective episiotomy compared with routine episiotomy resulted in
less severe perineal/vaginal trauma, and less need for perineal su-
ture. Evidence synthesis by another review also reported that ma-
ternal outcomes of routine episiotomy including severe perineal
23

 laceration, pain and pain medication use were no better than in
women with selective use of episiotomy (Hartmann 2005). How-
ever, our review presents the main evidence alongside the use of
GRADE - the other reviews have not done so.

Implications for practice
Proponents of episiotomy argue that routine episiotomy facilitates
delivery, that surgical healing results in better outcomes, and that
the procedure reduces third- and fourth-degree tears, as outlined
in our logic framework (Figure 1). In terms of the outcomes re-
flecting these arguments, the evidence does not support a policy of
routine episiotomy: we identified increased risk of severe perineal/
vaginal trauma; and no clear difference on blood loss at delivery,
babies with newborn Apgar score less than seven at five minutes,
perineal infection, women with moderate or severe pain (mea-
sured by visual analogue scale), long-term dyspareunia (at least six
months) and long-term urinary incontinence (at least six months)
when compared with the policy of selective episiotomy.
Practically speaking, it is probable that an episiotomy means that
women require a longer postnatal stay in hospital while their epi-
siotomyheals.Womenwith anintactperineumusuallyleave much
more quickly. This is more convenient, and reduces hospital costs.
Further cost-effectiveness analysis (Borghi 2002) may help eluci-
date the extent of cost savings with selective episiotomy.
Implications for research
The data on pain were mostly not well collected or standardised,
which may reflect the age of the studies. Activities of daily living
measured by a validated scale might have helped when comparing
two different policies of episiotomy. Blood loss estimates were not
measured using a standard approach, and future studies in instru-
mental delivery would benefit from clear and standardised out-
come definition. Few trials reported some of our key outcomes:
low Apgar score at five minutes was reported in only two trials,
perineal infection in two, perineal pain in one, long term dyspare-
unia in three, and urinary incontinence in three trials, as well as
any possible effect on breastfeeding. The trials included in this
review did not appear to consider women’s preferences and views
on these procedures and the outcomes important to them.
Other remaining questions relate to relative effects with the type
of episiotomy (midline or mediolateral, or different angles of epi-
siotomy).

Methods
RCT
Participants
Women after admission to the labour ward, I00 primigravidae in each group
Inclusion criteria: primigravidae in labour at term with a singleton fetus in cephalic
presentation
Exclusion criteria: participants with gross fetal malformations
Interventions
Intervention group: episiotomy was avoided and was only given for fetal distress or when
severe perineal trauma was judged to be imminent
Control group: right mediolateral episiotomy was made in all primigravidae according
to hospital policy
Outcomes
Severe perineal trauma, rate of episiotomy
Notes
Right mediolateral episiotomies. Epsiotomy rates were 32% for the selective group and
100% for the routine group

Belizan 1993
Methods
Generation of randomisation by computer from a random sample generator programme,
organised in balanced blocks of 100, with stratification by centre and by parity (nulli-
parous and primiparous)
Allocation concealment by sequentially-numbered, sealed, opaque envelopes, divided
according to parity
Participants
N: 2606 women; 1298 women in the intervention group and 1308 women in the control
group. 1555 were nulliparous (778 in the selective group and 777 in the routine group)
and 1051 primiparous (520 in the selective and 531 in the routine group).
Inclusion criteria: uncomplicated labour; 37 to 42 weeks’ gestation; nulliparous or prim-
iparous. Single fetus
Cephalic presentation; no previous caesarean section or severe perineal tears
Interventions
Intervention: selective - try to avoid an episiotomy if possible and only do it for fetal
indications or if severe perineal trauma was judged to be imminent
Control: routine - do an episiotomy according to the hospital’s policy prior to the trial
Outcomes
Severe perineal trauma (primary outcome); middle/upper vaginal tears; anterior trauma;
any posterior surgical repair; posterior perineal surgical repair; perineal pain at discharge;
haematoma at discharge; healing complications, infection and dehiscence at 7 days
Apgar score less than 7 at 1st minute.

Interventions
Intervention: restrictive - try to avoid an episiotomy even if severe perineal trauma was
judged to be imminent and only do it for fetal indications
Control: liberal - in addition to fetal indications use of episiotomy when a tear is judged
to be imminent
Outcomes
Reduction of episiotomies, increase of intact perinea and only minor perineal trauma,
perineal pain (displayed in score) in the postpartum period, percentage change in overall
anterior perineal trauma, difference of the PH of the umbilical artery, percentage of um-
bilical artery PH less than 7.15, percentage of Apgar scores less than 7 at 1 and 5 minutes,
maternal blood loss at delivery (measured by mean difference pre/post haemoglobin),

Intervention: not to undergo episiotomy unless it was considered to be medically essen-
tial by the person in charge, that is the accoucheur could see that a woman was going
to sustain a greater damage or if the intact perineum was thought to be hindering the
achievement of a safe normal or operative delivery
Control: to undergo mediolateral episiotomy

Methods
Generation method of randomisation not established
Concealment method of allocation by envelopes
Participants
Number of participants not established. There is only information for 165 women
available to follow-up but information about women lost to follow-up is lacking, either
because 1 of the study authors was not available, or because of the early discharge scheme.
98 primigravidae and 67 multigravidae. 94 in the intervention and 71 in the control
group
Inclusion criteria: women were at least 37 weeks’ gestational age, cephalic presentation
and vaginal delivery
Exclusion criteria: lack of consent, labour at less than 37 weeks pregnant, presentation
other than vertex, caesarean section and the unavailability of an accoucheur willing to
abide by the research protocol. Women who subsequently had a forceps delivery were
not excluded
Interventions
Intervention: restrict - not to perform specifically to prevent laceration
Control: liberal - to receive standard current management whereby perineal damage was
avoided by control of the descent of the head and supporting the perineum at crowning.
An episiotomy was made if there was fetal distress, or for maternal reasons to shorten the
2nd stage such as severe exhaustion, inability to complete expulsion or unwillingness to
continue pushing. Episiotomy was performed if the perineum appeared to be too tight
or rigid to permit delivery without laceration, or if a laceration appeared imminent
Outcomes
Second-degree tear. Third-degree tear. Need for perineal suturing. Any perineal pain at
3 days. Healing at 3 days. Tenderness at 3 days. Perineal infection at 3 days. Blood loss
during delivery
Notes
Mediolateral episiotomies. Epsiotomy rate for restricted group were 18% and for the
routine group were 69%

Methods
Generation method of randomisation not established
Concealment of allocation by opaque, sequentially-numbered envelopes
Participants
N: 703 randomised (N = 353; control, N = 350).
Inclusion criteria: women had a parity of 0, 1, or 2, between the ages of 18 and 40
years, carried a single fetus, spoke English or French, and were of medical and obstetrical
low risk as determined by their physician
Exclusion criteria: prematurity, that is gestation less than 37 weeks, medical conditions
developing late in pregnancy, fetal distress, caesarean deliveries and planned forceps

Methods
RCT. Random allocation to:
A. restrictive use of episiotomy for instrumental vaginal delivery
B. routine use of episiotomy for instrumental vaginal delivery
Participants
N: 200 women (intervention, N = 101; control, N = 99)
Inclusion criteria: primigravid women in the third trimester of pregnancy (> 36 weeks)
with a singleton cephalic pregnancy who were English speakers and had no contra-
indication to vaginal birth
Exclusion criteria: women who were: non-English speakers; who had contra-indication
to vaginal birth; multiple pregnancy; malpresentation; multiparous women as the rate
of instrumental delivery is significantly lower in these women making the effort of
recruitment unjustified; women who had not given written informed consent prior to
the onset of labour
Interventions
Intervention: restrictive use of episiotomy for instrumental vaginal delivery (only if
tearing becomes apparent)
Control: routine use of episiotomy for instrumental vaginal delivery (in all cases)
Outcomes
Extensive perineal tearing involving the anal sphincter (third- or fourth-degree tears)
Postpartum haemorrhage, shoulder dystocia, the mother’s perception of pain, the length
of postnatal hospital stay, urinary or bowel symptoms and the rate of healing compli-
cations, low Apgar scores, low arterial blood gases, admission to the neonatal intensive

Methods
Ralloc software (Boston College Department of Economics, Boston, MA) was used to
create a random sequence of numbers in blocks with 2, 4, and 6 size permutations.
Participants were assigned either to the routine episiotomy or the selective episiotomy
group, depending of the basis of the randomisation sequence kept at the institution
Participants
N: 446 randomised, 223 in each group (intervention, N = 222 analysed; control, N =
223)
Inclusion criteria: nulliparous women with pregnancies more than 28 weeks of gestation
who had vaginal deliveries
Exclusion criteria: women with multiple pregnancies, and with breech presentations
and those who did not sign the informed consent or refused to participate in the study
Interventions
Intervention: selective - to undergo the procedure only in cases of forceps delivery, fetal
distress, or shoulder dystocia or when the operator considered that a severe laceration
was impending and could only be avoided by performing an episiotomy.
Control: routine - to undergo the procedure at the time the fetal head was distending
the introitus
Outcomes
The primary outcome of severe laceration to perineal tissues was defined as a third-degree
laceration when the extent of the lesion included the external anal sphincter totally or
partially, and fourth-degree laceration when the rectal mucosa was involved
Notes
Midline episiotomies. Epsiotomy rates were 24.3% for restricted group and 100% for
the routine group

an episiotomy and performing it only for fetal indications (fetal bradycardia, tachycardia,
or meconium-stained liquor)
Control: liberal policy - “Try to prevent a tear”: the intention being that episiotomy
should be used more liberally to prevent tears
Outcomes
Severe maternal trauma: extension through the anal sphincter or to the rectal mucosa or
to the upper 3rd of the vagina
Apgar score less than 7 at 1 minute
Severe or moderate perineal pain 10 days after delivery
Admission to special care baby unit in first 10 days of life. Perineal discomfort 3 months
after delivery
Number of resumption of sexual intercourse within a month and 3 months after delivery
Any dyspareunia in 2 years. Any incontinence of urine at 3 years. Urinary incontinence
severe to wear a pad at 3 years

Henriksen 1992
As described in the Summary, it was a quasi-randomised study. (Design: The study was a population-based
observational study. 2 approaches were used in the analyses: At first we considered the women giving birth as
quasi randomised to 1 of 3 equally sized groups of midwives, where episiotomy was used to different extents.
Next, we studied the effect of episiotomy on the state of the anal sphincter as well as birthweight, parity and the
duration of the second stage of labour.)
Islam 2013
The study compared the use of episiotomy or not, rather than the restrictive use and routine use of episiotomy
Javed 2007
The comparison was not conducted between the restrictive use of episiotomy and routine use of episiotomy, but
to compare the use of episiotomy or not. Furthermore, participants were not randomly allocated to the 2 groups.
(Page 107, 300 primigravida were selected randomly by lottery system but when a patient included in group B,
who was not to undergo episiotomy, needed that due to fetal indication, she was shifted to the other group A
who were to undergo episiotomy, medio-lateral in every case.)
Karbanova 2013
The studies aimed to compare mediolateral versus lateral episiotomy, and to compare the effect of episiotomy

Summary
Results
The relative risks reported in the results section have been calculated using a fixed effects analysis. There is significant heterogeneity in the
outcomes for suturing and perineal trauma. Use of the fixed effects approach ignores this variability between studies, producing artificially
narrow confidence intervals. For example, the relative risk for ’need for suturing perineal trauma’ changes from 0.74 (0.71,0.77) to
0.71(0.61,0.81) with a random effects model, and that for ’any anterior trauma’ changes from 1.79 (1.55,2.07) to 1.48 (0.99,2.21).
[Summary of comment from Carol Preston, September 2001.]
Reply
In cases of heterogeneity among the results of the studies, it is clearly of interest to determine the causes by conducting subgroup analyses
or meta-regression on the basis of biological characteristics of the population, use of different interventions, methodological quality of
the studies, etc, to find the source of heterogeneity. Trying to find the source of heterogeneity, we performed beforehand a sensitivity
analysis stratifying by parity. When the heterogeneity were not readily explained by this sensitivity analysis, we used a random-effects
model. A random-effects meta-analysis model involves an assumption that the effects being estimated in the different studies are not
identical, but follow similar distribution. However, one needs to be careful in interpreting these results as, the relative risk summary for
the random-effects model tend to show a larger treatment effect than the fixed-effect model while not eliminating the heterogeneity
itself (Villar 2001).

Summary
This important and well-performed review assesses the effects of selective use of episiotomy compared with routine episiotomy during
vaginal birth. We would like to have more information on several important definitions, used in this review. It is known that there are
several strong indications for the use of an episiotomy, such as fetal distress, breech delivery and assisted delivery. We can presume that
with “restricted use of episiotomy” the review authors mean that there was no episiotomy used, unless there was such a strong indication
for an episiotomy in that specific case. We wonder what the exact indications were in this specific review. To prevent confusion, we
think it is necessary to have a clear description of what is meant by a “restrictive use of episiotomy” policy in this Cochrane review.
The exact definitions of “anterior perineal trauma” and “posterior perineal trauma” are described properly under the subheading
“description of the condition”. In addition, the various degrees of spontaneous ruptures are well-defined. However, the terms “severe
vaginal/perineal trauma” (outcome 5) and “severe perineal trauma” (outcome 8) are not well described. We can assume involvement of
the anal sphincter complex (third and fourth degree ruptures) is defined as severe trauma. Unfortunately, this is not described in the
background text, although it is of great importance to interpret the outcomes of the review correctly.
Similarly, the exact definitions of Outcomes 21, 24 and 27 (Moderate/severe perineal pain in 3 days; - 10 days; -3 months) are not clear.
The methods used in the individual trials to assess the degree of experienced pain, for example the standardized visual analogue score,
are not described. In Outcome 33 (Healing complications at 7 days), there is no specification of these complications and/or symptoms
involved with healing complications. Therefore, it is not possible for the reader to determine how serious these complications were.

 In conclusion, we think that this review would gain strength if the above mentioned definitions are added to the description of the
data.

Reply
In this newly updated review, the detailed definitions of severe perineal/vaginal trauma have been listed in the Background. For perineal
pain, we have set ’moderate and severe pain measured by the standardized visual analogue score’ in the main outcome and included it
in the GRADE. We also reported other self-reported pains at different time points of interest. Please refer to Data and Analysis 1.5 and
1.11. We hope the analysis is clear to understand. Thank you for your helpful comments.

New citation required and conclusions have changed
In women where no instrumental delivery is intended,
selective episiotomy policies result in fewer women
with severe perineal/vaginal trauma. This suggests that
the rationale used to justify routine episiotomy - that it
reduces perineal/vaginal trauma - is unfounded. Other
findings, both in the short or long term, provide no
clear indication of harm of restrictive policies
The review thus demonstrates that believing that rou-
tine episiotomy reduces perineal/vaginal trauma is
not justified by current evidence. Further research in
women where instrumental delivery is intended may
help clarify if routine episiotomy is useful in this par-

We removed Objective 2 of the protocol, “to compare midline and mediolateral episiotomy” since we found it inappropriate to include
this objective in the course of writing the review, as the topic ’selective versus routine episiotomy for vaginal birth’ and which procedure
is used are two different topics. We did look in a subgroup analysis for evidence of a difference in effects depending on the procedure,
but there was no obvious pattern. We think it better to carry out another independent review to make this comparison, although we
did not find eligible studies comparing these two surgical procedures.
In the protocol, the primary outcome was described as “Severe perineal trauma including, severe vaginal trauma, or severe perineal and
vaginal trauma (third- or fourth-degree trauma, irrespective of allocated group, as defined in the background)”. We noted during the
review that it was a little ambiguous as to where this actually included vaginal trauma, so we altered the descriptor slightly to make this
explicit.
In the protocol we included “first or second degree perineal trauma”. This outcome is uninformative as it excludes women with severe
trauma. The outcome, “any trauma” is also uninformative as the control group expects women to receive an episiotomy, which is in
effect “second degree trauma” but would not be reported as such. We therefore dropped this outcome.
Since the previous version of this review, we have changed the title from ’Episiotomy for vaginal birth’ to ’Selective versus routine use
of episiotomy for vaginal birth’ for clarity about the scope of the review.
Since only one trial reported perineal pain measured by visual analogue scale, we also reported pain at different time points by any
measure of interest. We think this would be informative for clinical practice.
