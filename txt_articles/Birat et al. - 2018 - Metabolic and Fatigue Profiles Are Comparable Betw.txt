The aim of this study was to determine whether prepubertal children are metabolically
comparable to well-trained adult endurance athletes and if this translates into similar
fatigue rates during high-intensity exercise in both populations. On two different
occasions, 12 prepubertal boys (10.5 ± 1.1 y), 12 untrained men (21.2 ± 1.5 y), and
13 endurance male athletes (21.5 ± 2.7 y) completed an incremental test to determine
the power output at VO2max (PVO2max) and a Wingate test to evaluate the maximal
anaerobic power (Pmax) and relative decrement in power output (i.e., the fatigue index,
FI). Furthermore, oxygen uptake (VO2), heart rate (HR), and capillary blood lactate
concentration ([La]) were measured to determine (i) the net aerobic contribution at 5-s
intervals during the Wingate test, and (ii) the post-exercise recovery kinetics of VO2, HR,
and [La]. The Pmax-to-PVO2max ratio was not significantly different between children (1.9
± 0.5) and endurance athletes (2.1 ± 0.2) but lower than untrained men (3.2 ± 0.3,
p < 0.001 for both). The relative energy contribution derived from oxidative metabolism
was also similar in children and endurance athletes but greater than untrained men over
the second half of the Wingate test (p < 0.001 for both). Furthermore, the post-exercise
recovery kinetics of VO2, HR, and [La] in children and endurance athletes were faster than
those of untrained men. Finally, FI was comparable between children and endurance
athletes (−35.2 ± 9.6 vs. −41.8 ± 9.4%, respectively) but lower than untrained men
(−51.8 ± 4.1%, p < 0.01). To conclude, prepubertal children were observed to be
metabolically comparable to well-trained adult endurance athletes, and were thus less
fatigable during high-intensity exercise than untrained adults.

INTRODUCTION
It has been widely demonstrated that prepubertal children fatigue less than untrained adults
when performing dynamic, whole-body activities such as maximal cycling (Ratel et al., 2002),
short running bouts (Ratel et al., 2004), and vertical jumps (Lazaridis et al., 2018), or maximum
voluntary contractions under isometric (Hatzikotoulas et al., 2014; Ratel et al., 2015) or isokinetic

Metabolic Profile in Children
conditions (De Ste Croix et al., 2009). The lower fatigability
in prepubertal children has been mainly attributed to a lower
peripheral (i.e., muscular) fatigue compared to untrained adults,
owing to their greater relative reliance on oxidative energy
sources (Ratel et al., 2008; Tonson et al., 2010) and their
potentially greater proportion of fatigue-resistant slow-twitch
muscle fibers (Lexell et al., 1992). This specific metabolic profile
in prepubertal children could lead to a lower accumulation of
metabolic by-products (e.g., H+ ions and inorganic phosphate)
and a lower phosphocreatine depletion during high-intensity
exercise in prepubertal children compared to untrained adults
(Kappenstein et al., 2013). As these metabolic by-products
promote the development of peripheral fatigue through an
alteration of contractile properties and reduction in excitation-
contraction coupling (Allen et al., 2008), a lower accumulation
of metabolites could translate into a reduced fatigue at
the periphery, as usually observed in prepubertal children
(Hatzikotoulas et al., 2014; Ratel et al., 2015).
Beyond muscular factors, prepubertal children also display
faster O2 uptake and heart rate (HR) recovery kinetics following
high-intensity exercise than untrained adults (Armon et al., 1991;
Hebestreit et al., 1993). This could be ascribed to their lower
anaerobic capacity and thus to their smaller O2 deficit incurred
at the start of the exercise, which calls for a lesser excess post-
exercise O2 consumption. Furthermore, prepubertal children
could be characterized by a greater parasympathetic reactivation
of the autonomic nervous system early in the recovery period
after exercise than untrained adults (Ohuchi et al., 2000). Taken
together, this could explain why prepubertal children are able
to complete repeated high-intensity exercise bouts easier when
compared to their older untrained counterparts (Ratel et al., 2002,
2004).
However, it is now known that metabolic profiles show
significant inter-individual variability in young adults, and is
specifically associated with their training background. While
adults with a strong sprint training background predominantly
rely on anaerobic energy support during exercise, endurance
athletes depend more notably on oxidative energy pathways
than either untrained adults or sprint-trained athletes (Pesta
et al., 2013). This more oxidative profile in endurance athletes
translates particularly into (i) a faster recovery of power
output (Bogdanis et al., 1995) and cardio-respiratory parameters
following high-intensity exercise (Short and Sedlock, 1997)
and (ii) a lower peripheral fatigue during repeated maximum
voluntary contractions (Garrandes et al., 2007). Hence, it is
possible that metabolic and fatigue profiles of well-trained
adult endurance athletes could be similar to those observed in
prepubertal children during high-intensity exercise, as previously
stated by Ratel and Blazevich (2017). However, agreement has not
been reached because there is a lack of scientific evidence relating
to this issue.
Therefore, the aim of the present study was to determine
whether, contrary to untrained adults, prepubertal children
are metabolically comparable to well-trained adult endurance
athletes and if this translates into similar fatigue rates during
high-intensity exercise in both populations. We hypothesized
that the relative energy contribution derived from oxidative
metabolism during high-intensity exercise would be similar
in prepubertal children and endurance-trained adult athletes,
and this could lead to comparable fatigue rates between both
populations. Furthermore, it is presumed that untrained adults
rely less on oxidative metabolism and therefore fatigue faster
during high-intensity exercise than prepubertal children and
well-trained adult endurance athletes.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Participants
Twelve healthy boys (age: 8–12 y), 12 untrained men (19–23 y),
and 13 endurance male athletes (19–27 y) volunteered to
participate in the study. To be included, boys and untrained
men had to perform recreational physical activity for ≤4 h per
week and to be free of any medical contra-indication to physical
activity. Boys were prepubertal based on the assessment of their
somatic maturity (see below). None of them were involved in any
vigorous physical activity or engaged in a specific aerobic training
program. Boys were recruited from primary and secondary
schools while untrained men were university students. Their
recreational physical activities were Alpine skiing, snowboarding,
sailing, skateboarding, climbing, etc. In contrast, endurance-
trained adults were engaged in long distance physical activities
for ≥6 times a week for at least 2 years and were national-
level competitive athletes (i.e., long-distance runners, cyclists,
and triathletes). They were recruited from local sports clubs
(athletics, triathlon, and cycling). This study was approved by a
local Institutional Ethics Review Board. The study was conducted
in conformity with the policy statement regarding the use of
human subjects by the Declaration of Helsinki. All experimental
procedures were clearly explained to the participants, who then
gave written consent before the commencement of testing.
Written consent was also obtained from parents/guardians before
children were accepted into the study.
Experimental Procedure (Design)
All participants were tested in two experimental sessions
separated by at least 48 h. During the first experimental session,
anthropometric characteristics, body composition, maturation
status, and the power at maximum O2 uptake (PVO2max) were
evaluated. Furthermore, the participants had to perform two
sprints (∼7 s) on a cycle ergometer (Cyclus model II, MSE
Electronic Medical, Leipzig, Germany) separated by 1 min of
recovery against a resistance corresponding to 7.5% body mass
(BM). These sprints served to familiarize the volunteers with
the experimental procedures of the second session. During the
second visit, the participants were asked to perform a Wingate
cycle test to determine the maximal anaerobic power (Pmax),
the fatigue rate (i.e., the relative decrement in power output),
the relative (net) energy contribution derived from oxidative
metabolism and the post-exercise recovery rates of blood lactate
concentration, HR, and O2 uptake. The Wingate cycle test was
chosen because it allows the simultaneous investigation of cardio-
respiratory, metabolic, and muscular components of fatigue
during a whole-body dynamic activity and is a common and well-
learned activity within the population. Furthermore, the Wingate

cycle test was found to be highly reliable from one session to
another in children and adults for the evaluation of high-intensity
exercise performance indices (Hebestreit et al., 1993).
Anthropometric Measurements and Body
Composition Analysis
Body mass was measured to the nearest 0.1 kg using a digital
weight scale (TANITA, BC-545N, Japan) and standing height
was assessed using a portable stadiometer with the participants
barefoot (TANITA, HR001, Japan). Sitting height was also
measured with the stadiometer while the participants sat on the
floor with their back against a wall. Body Mass Index (BMI) was
subsequently calculated by the equation BM (kg)/height2 (m2).
Skinfold thickness was measured in duplicate at the triceps and
subscapular sites using a Harpenden caliper (Baty International,
Burgess Hill, UK). The measurements were taken by the same
investigator on the right side of the body to reduce variability
in the results. Body fat (BF, %) was assessed using Slaughter’s
equations (Slaughter et al., 1988). Body fat (kg) was calculated
by multiplying BF (%) by BM (kg). Fat-free mass (FFM, kg) was
determined by subtracting BF (kg) from BM (kg).
Maturation Assessment
Age from peak height velocity (APHV) was used to assess somatic
maturity and determined by using height, sitting height and BM.
Its calculation was only done in children and was based on sex-
specific regression equations according to the method proposed
by Mirwald et al. (2002).
Maximal Aerobic Power Assessment
PVO2max was assessed using a submaximal graded test on a cycle
ergometer (Cyclus model II, MSE Electronic Medical, Leipzig,
Germany). Workloads were initially set at 30, 100, and 130 W and
then increased by 15, 30, and 30 W every 3 min in prepubertal
children, untrained adults, and well-trained adult endurance
athletes, respectively. The pedaling rate was constant and self-
selected by the participants between 50 and 90 rpm. The test
was designed to have one warm-up stage and three to four
additional submaximal stages leading HR to at least 160 bpm.
HR was measured during the last minute of each stage using
the Polar recorder linked to the cycle ergometer (Polar Electro,
Kempele, Finland). If the participant’s HR did not reach a plateau
or the participant did not maintain cadence, the measurement
was considered to be invalid. PVO2max was then assessed from
individual linear regressions between power output and HR and
by calculating the power output at the age-predicted maximal HR
(HRmax). The squared Bravais-Pearson correlation coefficients of
these linear relationships ranged between 0.91 and 0.99 (mean
± SD: 0.98 ± 0.02). HRmax was assessed using the equation
formulated by Shargal et al. (2015), which was validated from a
large cohort of healthy males aged between 10 and 80 years:
HRmax = 208.609 − 0.716 × age
(1)
Furthermore, VO2max was assessed using the following equation:
VO2max(L · min−1) = (PVO2max(W) × 60)/(E × R)
(2)
where E is the caloric equivalent of oxygen for a respiratory
exchange ratio above 1.0, i.e., 21131 J·L−1, and R the cycling
efficiency (%). A delta efficiency of 23% was chosen for all the
volunteers since the literature reports no apparent difference
during cycling between 10.5-year-old boys (23.2%), 21.3-year-
old untrained men (22.5%), and 25.6-year-old well-trained
endurance triathletes and cyclists (22.7%) (Rowland et al., 1990;
Louis et al., 2012).
The Fatigue Protocol
The testing session started with a rest period of 10 min in a
sitting position on the cycle ergometer. The saddle height was
set at 107% of trochanteric leg length to give optimal comfort
to each participant (Hamley and Thomas, 1967). Afterwards,
the participants were asked to perform a standardized warm-
up of 4 min cycling against a resistance that was adjusted to
2% of their BM. At the end of the second, third, and fourth
minutes, they also had to perform one sprint lasting 5 s against
a resistance corresponding to 7.5% BM. After a subsequent 5-
min rest, the participants were instructed to perform a Wingate
test that consisted of pedaling as fast as possible for 30 s
against a resistance corresponding to 0.075 g·kg−1 BM (Bar-
Or, 1987). This braking load was chosen as it does not appear
to influence Pmax or fatigue rate during the Wingate test,
when compared to heavier loads (e.g., 11% BM), in either
untrained adults or less-powerful athletes such as endurance
athletes (Jaafar et al., 2016). Furthermore, it corresponds to
an optimal braking load to produce Pmax and mean power
output (Pmean) during a Wingate test in children aged from 6
to 12 years (Carlson and Naughton, 1994). Prior to each sprint,
the experimenter announced a countdown of “5-4-3-2-1-GO”
during which the participants were instructed to put the right
crank arm 45◦ past top position. After test termination, the
subjects were supervised during a 20-min recovery period in a
sitting position. The participants were instructed not to engage
in any strenuous activity on the day preceding the exercise
test.
Ratings of Perceived Exertion
Ratings of perceived exertion (RPE) were noted immediately after
completion of the Wingate test using the Children’s Effort Rating
Table (Williams et al., 1994). The Children’s Effort Rating Table
(CERT) asks participants to rate their effort on a 1–10 scale with
1 indicating that the exercise is very, very easy, and 10 indicating
that the effort is so hard that the participant has to stop. Before
testing, the range of sensations that correspond to categories of
effort within the scale were clearly explained to each participant.
Blood Sampling and Analysis
Capillary blood samples (0.2 µL) were obtained from the
fingertips prior to the warm-up ([La]rest), before the Wingate test,
immediately after completion of the test ([La](0)), and at 1, 3, 5, 7,
9, 15, and 20 min in recovery. Blood lactate concentrations were
determined using the Lactate Scout+ analyzer (EKF Diagnostic,
Leipzig, Germany). The device was systematically calibrated
before each experimental session.

Gas Exchange and HR Recording
During the second experimental session, HR was continuously
monitored using the Polar recorder linked to the Cyclus
Model II ergometer (Polar Electro, Kempele, Finland). VO2 was
also continuously measured breath-by-breath using a mobile
spiroergometry system (METAMAX R
�3B, CORTEX Biophysik
GmbH, Leipzig, Germany).
Data Processing
Power and Fatigue Indices
Maximal anaerobic power (Pmax) and minimal power (Pmin)
reached during the Wingate test were defined as the highest
and the lowest mechanical powers respectively, recorded over
a 0.5-s period. The average power was considered as the
mean power output (Pmean) sustained over the whole 30-s
test. The fatigue index (FI) was calculated as the difference
between Pmax and Pmin expressed as percentage of Pmax (Bar-
Or, 1987). The maximum anaerobic-to-aerobic mechanical
power ratio was calculated by normalizing the Wingate test-
derived Pmax to the estimated maximal aerobic power (Pmax-
to-PVO2max ratio). This anaerobic-to-aerobic power ratio was
introduced by Bar-Or (1986) as a simple metabolic index to
assess physiological function. A higher power ratio indicates
a higher anaerobic ability relative to aerobic capacity. Several
studies in adult elite athletes (cyclists and swimmers) have also
demonstrated the usefulness of this mechanical power ratio in the
physiological evaluation of these athletes, as the power ratio gives
recommendations as to whether endurance training or specific
strength and power training should be emphasized (Mercier et al.,
1993; Baron, 2001).
Relative Energy Contribution
The aerobic energy (in J) utilized during the Wingate test was
calculated at 5-s intervals based on the net oxygen uptake
(VO2−VO2rest) and the caloric equivalent of oxygen for a
respiratory exchange ratio above 1.0, i.e., 21131 J·mL−1. The total
energy consumed during the Wingate test was assessed from
the mechanical work done at 5-s intervals and by considering a
cycling efficiency of 23% for all the volunteers (Rowland et al.,
1990; Louis et al., 2012). The relative energy contribution (%)
derived from aerobic metabolism was then calculated at 5-s
intervals throughout the Wingate test.
HR and VO2 Recovery Kinetics
Resting VO2 and HR values (VO2rest and HRrest, respectively)
were determined in a sitting position during the first 10 min of
the second experimental session. Furthermore, the peak values of
VO2 and HR (VO2pk and HRpk, respectively) were considered
as the highest values reached at the end of the Wingate test.
As resting and peak values of VO2 and/or HR differed between
groups, the post-exercise recovery kinetics of VO2 and HR
were determined by considering the net changes (peak exercise–
baseline) expressed as percentage of peak values. Subsequent
comparisons were done from values taken at 15-s intervals during
the first 2-min and at 60-s intervals during the last 8-min. Values
were more frequently taken at first in consideration of the initial
fast phase of recovery of VO2 and HR in subsequent comparisons
between groups.
[La] Recovery Curves
Individual blood lactate recovery curves were fitted to the
biexponential time function:
[La](t) = [La](0) + A1(1 − e−γ1t) + A2(1 − e−γ2t)
(3)
where [La](0) and [La](t) (mmol·L−1) are lactate concentrations
in capillary blood measured at recovery onset and at a given
recovery time, respectively; concentration parameters A1 and A2
(mmol.L−1) are the amplitudes of the exponential functions, and
γ1 and γ2 (min−1) are the velocity constants that describe lactate
exchange and removal capacity, respectively (Zouloumian and
Freund, 1981). The blood lactate recovery curves were fitted to
eq. 3 by iterative nonlinear regression using the GraphPad Prism
7 software (La Jolla, California, USA) to determine the values of
A1, A2, γ1, and γ2; [La](0) being an experimental measurement.
Furthermore, the highest blood lactate concentration reached
during the post-exercise recovery period ([La]pk) and the time
required to reach [La]pk (t[La]pk) were calculated from individual
blood lactate recovery curves. Equation (3) was considered
representative of lactate recovery kinetics since it accounted for
more than 96% of the variance in the experimental blood lactate
recovery curves (0.965 < r < 0.998).
Statistical Analysis

test and the Barlett’s test, respectively. One-way (group) ANOVA
was used to compare age, anthropometric characteristics,
performance outcomes (e.g., Pmax, PVO2max, Pmax-to-PVO2max
ratio) and blood lactate kinetics parameters (e.g., A1, A2, γ1,
γ2, La]pk, tLa]pk) between groups. When ANOVA revealed a
significant effect, a Newman-Keuls post-hoc test was applied
to test the discrimination between means. Furthermore, a
two-way (group × time) ANOVA with repeated measures was
used to analyze the relative energy contribution from oxidative
metabolism throughout the Wingate test as well as the post-
exercise recovery kinetics of HR and O2 uptake. When ANOVA
revealed a significant main or interaction effect, a Newman-
Keuls post-hoc test was applied to test the discrimination
between means. The size effect and statistical power have also
been reported when significant main or interaction effects
were detected. The size effect was assessed using the partial
eta-squared (η2) and ranked as follows: ∼0.01 = small effect,
∼0.06 = moderate effect, ≥0.14 = large effect (Cohen, 1969).
A linear regression model between the fatigue index and the
Pmax-to-PVO2max ratio was fitted by the least squares method
considering all the volunteers, and a squared Bravais-Pearson
correlation coefficient (r2) of this linear regression model
was calculated. The limit for statistical significance was set at
p < 0.05. Statistical procedures were performed using Statistica
8.0 software (Statsoft, Inc., USA). Results were presented in the
text, tables and figures as mean ± SD.

Participants’ Physical Characteristics
The physical characteristics of participants are presented in
Table 1. ANOVA revealed significant differences between the
different groups for age [F(2, 34) = 131.1, p < 0.001, η2 = 0.88,
power = 1.0], height [F(2, 34) = 110.2, p < 0.001, η2 = 0.87, power

HRrest [F(2, 34) = 33.6, p <
0.001, η2 = 0.66, power = 1.0],
PVO2max (W) [F(2, 34) = 118.4, p < 0.001, η2 = 0.87, power =
1.0], PVO2max/BM (W·kg−1) [F(2, 34) = 26.1, p < 0.001, η2 =
0.61, power = 0.99], and the Pmax-to-PVO2max ratio [F(2, 34) =
38.5, p < 0.001, η2 = 0.69, power = 1.0]. Post-hoc tests showed no
significant difference for age and height between untrained adults
and well-trained adult endurance athletes. However, untrained
adults displayed significantly higher values for BM (p < 0.05),
BMI (p < 0.01), BF (p < 0.05), FFM (p < 0.05), HRrest
(p < 0.001) when compared to their well-trained endurance
counterparts. In contrast, as expected, PVO2max (W and W·kg−1)
was significantly higher in well-trained adult endurance athletes
than untrained adults (p < 0.001 for both).
Furthermore, stature, BM, BMI, FFM, and PVO2max (W)
were significantly lower in prepubertal children than untrained
adults and well-trained adult endurance athletes (p < 0.001 for
each). In contrast, prepubertal children displayed significantly
higher values for BF and HRrest than their older trained
and untrained counterparts (p < 0.05 at least). However,
PVO2max/BM (W·kg−1) was not significantly different between
prepubertal children and untrained adults.

More specifically, untrained adults displayed significantly
higher values for Pmax (W), Pmean (W), and FI (%) than well-
trained adult endurance athletes (p < 0.05 at least). However,
Pmax/BM (W·kg−1), Pmean/BM (W·kg−1), tPmax, and RPE were
not significantly different between untrained and endurance
trained adults. Furthermore, children displayed significantly
lower values than untrained and trained adults for all parameters
investigated (p < 0.05 at least) except for FI (%), which was
similar to that of endurance-trained adults.
Regarding the relative aerobic contribution, ANOVA tended
to show a group × time interaction effect [F(10, 170) = 3.86,
p = 0.09, η2 = 0.09, power = 0.78]. The relative aerobic
contribution increased progressively during the Wingate test

increment was not significantly different between prepubertal

higher than prepubertal children (p < 0.05 at least). Furthermore,

Correlation
A significant positive relationship was observed between FI

(r2 = 0.54, p < 0.001) (Figure 5).
DISCUSSION
The aim of the present study was to determine whether, contrary
to untrained adults, prepubertal children are metabolically
comparable to well-trained adult endurance athletes and if
this translates into similar fatigue rates during high-intensity
exercise between both populations. The main results confirm
our hypotheses since prepubertal children had a comparable
net contribution of energy derived from aerobic metabolism
to well-trained adult endurance athletes, and the rate of
fatigue, as illustrated by the relative decrement in power
output during the Wingate test, was similar between both
populations. Furthermore, the post-exercise recovery rates of
oxygen uptake and HR were respectively similar and faster in
prepubertal children than well-trained adult endurance athletes.
The removal ability of lactate from the blood compartment
was also higher in children than well-trained adult endurance
athletes.

Comparison Between Children and

In the present study, prepubertal children displayed a lower
relative decrement in power output during the Wingate test
than untrained adults (−35.2 vs. 51.8%, respectively); thus they
fatigued much less than their untrained older counterparts.
This finding cannot be explained by the fact that children
performed more (especially aerobic) physical activity since the
boys and men had to meet the same strict inclusion criteria and
their relative VO2max were not significantly different (49.0 vs.

48.1 mL·min−1·kg−1, respectively). The finding is in accordance
with the literature showing a reduced susceptibility to fatigue in
prepubertal children during different whole-body, high-intensity
activities such as cycling (Ratel et al., 2002), running (Ratel et al.,
2004), and hopping (Lazaridis et al., 2018), or during maximal
voluntary contractions under isometric (Ratel et al., 2015) and
isokinetic (De Ste Croix et al., 2009) conditions. The mechanisms
underpinning the differences in fatigue between prepubertal

development of fatigue during the Wingate test.
children and untrained adults are not yet fully understood but
it appears that prepubertal children experience less peripheral
(i.e., muscular) fatigue and potentially more central (i.e., neural)
fatigue than untrained adults during high-intensity exercise
(Streckis et al., 2007; Ratel et al., 2015). The greater fatigue effect
on central mechanisms in prepubertal children could account
for their lower fatigue at the peripheral level. Indeed, according
Frontiers in Physiology | www.frontiersin.org

 Birat et al.
Metabolic Profile in Children
to one theory, the central nervous system could limit the
recruitment of motor units to prevent any extensive homeostasis
disturbance, muscle damage, or biological harm (Noakes et al.,
2005). However, direct evidence to support this assumption is still
lacking. An alternative could be the lesser ability of prepubertal
children to fully voluntarily activate motor units during high-
intensity exercise (Dotan et al., 2012). Indeed, a lower activation
level was found to be associated with a higher resistance to
fatigue in adults (Nordlund et al., 2004). In the present study, the
maximal voluntary activation level was not measured; however,
the longer lag time to reach maximal anaerobic power in children
compared to untrained adults (tPmax: 5.8 vs. 1.8 s, respectively;
e.g., Figure 1, solid black line) might be suggestive that the
amplitude of muscle activation was lower during the early
phase of the Wingate test in children and then increased over
time, similar to wind-up effects observed in other (e.g., clinical)
populations (Hornby et al., 2009). Therefore, the possibility
exists that the higher resistance to fatigue in children could be
also ascribed to an inability to fully activate the neuromuscular
system during the early phase of an explosive exercise bout. This
hypothesis should be explicitly examined in future studies.
Among peripheral factors, the greater relative contribution of
energy derived from aerobic metabolism in prepubertal children
may account for their lower fatigability during high-intensity
exercise. The significant positive relationship found in the present
study between the fatigue index and the Pmax-to-PVO2max ratio
as well as the lower Pmax-to-PVO2max ratio in children compared
to young untrained adults (∼1.9 vs. 3.2, respectively) support
this assertion; the lower the relative anaerobic contribution, the
lower the development of fatigue during high intensity exercise
in children. Furthermore, the relative oxidative contribution
was found to be greater in prepubertal children than untrained
adults over the second half of the Wingate test. The recovery
kinetics of cardio-respiratory parameters (VO2 and HR) and
the removal ability of lactate out of the blood compartment
(γ2) were also faster following the Wingate test in prepubertal
children than untrained adults. These results are consistent with
previous studies describing the changes in the anaerobic-to-
aerobic mechanical power ratio (Pmax-to-PVO2max ratio) during
growth using either longitudinal (Falk and Bar-Or, 1993) or
cross-sectional (Blimkie et al., 1986; Falgairette et al., 1991)
experimental designs, despite aerobic mechanical power not
being determined using direct VO2max measurement in the
current study. For instance, Falgairette et al. (1991) reported a
progressive increment in the Pmax-to-PVO2max ratio until the
onset of adolescence (e.g., 1.8 at 9–10 y, 2.2 at 11–12 y, and
2.8 at 14–15 y) in 144 boys, after which it remained stable until
early adulthood (∼3.0 in physically active but non-competitive
young men in the study by Falk and Bar-Or, 1993). Furthermore,
some authors have reported (i) a greater relative contribution of
energy derived from oxidative metabolism during the Wingate
test in 11.8-year-old boys than 16.3-year-old male adolescents
(Beneke et al., 2007), and (ii) a smaller O2 deficit incurred at the
start of cycle exercise at 125% VO2max, which called for a lesser
excess post-exercise VO2 in prepubertal children than untrained
adults (Armon et al., 1991). Similarly, the recovery rate of HR
was found to be faster in prepubertal children than untrained
adults following high-intensity exercise lasting 1 min (Baraldi
et al., 1991; Hebestreit et al., 1993). Our results are also consistent
with the experimental data derived from blood measurements
showing no difference in the exchange capacity of lactate from
muscles into blood (γ1) between children and untrained adults
but a better ability to remove lactate from the blood compartment
(γ2) in children following the Wingate test (Beneke et al., 2005).
This more oxidative metabolic profile in prepubertal children
is usually associated with a lesser accumulation of metabolic by-
products (i.e., H+ ions, lactate, inorganic phosphate) derived
from anaerobic sources in exercising muscle (Kappenstein et al.,
2013). In the present study, lactate concentrations were only
measured at the blood level, and the bi-exponential time function
revealed a lower accumulation with a peak value appearing
earlier during the post-exercise recovery period in prepubertal
children, as evidenced by their lower A1, A2, and [La]pk values
and shorter t[La]pk (Table 3). The underlying mechanisms of this
diminished lactate response in prepubertal children has yet to
be elucidated, but the pediatric literature often suggests that the
lower blood/muscle lactate concentration in prepubertal children
results from their lower glycolytic energy turnover (Ratel et al.,
2002). Furthermore, it has been shown that the shorter t[La]pk in
children could be related to their lower accumulated lactate rate
during high intensity exercise (Dotan et al., 2003).
While lactate ion accumulation itself has only a small effect
on the loss of muscle power in fatigue (Allen et al., 2008),
the associated accumulation of metabolic by-products such as
H+ ions and inorganic phosphate could promote peripheral
fatigue to a greater extent through an alteration of contractile
processes and the excitation-contraction coupling (Allen et al.,
2008). The lesser accumulation of these metabolites in children
could therefore translate into a reduced fatigue at the periphery,
as usually observed in this population during high-intensity
exercise (Hatzikotoulas et al., 2014; Ratel et al., 2015). In addition,
the lower anaerobic capacity and the greater parasympathetic
reactivation of the autonomic nervous system early in the
recovery period after exercise in prepubertal children could
explain the faster readjustment of cardiovascular parameters
(Armon et al., 1991; Ohuchi et al., 2000) and the higher removal
ability of lactate from the blood compartment (γ2).
Comparison Between Children and
Endurance Adult Athletes
In contrast to untrained adults, prepubertal children displayed
the same metabolic profile as well-trained adult endurance
athletes. The Pmax-to-PVO2max ratio was similar in children and
endurance-trained athletes (1.9 vs. 2.1, respectively), and was
consistent with those previously reported in well-trained adult
endurance athletes who had VO2max values between 60 and
70 mL·min−1·kg−1 (∼2.0 for Meeuwisse et al., 1992; Hostrup
et al., 2016). Furthermore, the relative energy contribution
derived from oxidative metabolism during the Wingate test as
well as the post-exercise recovery rate of VO2 were similar
in children and endurance adult athletes. On this basis,
prepubertal children could be considered analogous to well-
trained adult endurance athletes from a physiological perspective,
Frontiers in Physiology | www.frontiersin.org

Metabolic Profile in Children
despite them having a lower work capacity than their older
counterparts, i.e., a lower mean power output during the
Wingate test (Ratel and Blazevich, 2017). Surprisingly, the results
of the present study also showed a faster post-exercise HR
recovery rate in prepubertal children than endurance adult
athletes. This unexpected result could be ascribed to a greater
parasympathetic reactivation of the autonomic nervous system
in the early recovery period in prepubertal children than well-
trained adult endurance athletes, owing to a greater central
cholinergic modulation of HR (Ohuchi et al., 2000). However,
further studies comparing the low-frequency and high-frequency
components of HR variability in the early recovery period
between both populations are required to test this assumption.
Furthermore, the results of the present study indicated a lack
of difference in γ1 and a higher γ2 in children than well-
trained adult endurance athletes, suggesting that prepubertal
children could have a better capacity to remove lactate from the
blood compartment than their older trained counterparts. This
difference in γ2 may be related to the shorter circulation time
in children (Cumming, 1978), as evidenced by their faster HR
recovery rate in the present study; the faster HR recovery rate,
the higher lactate removal ability (γ2) following the Wingate
test.
On a more practical level, the similar metabolic profile
of prepubertal children and well-trained adult endurance
athletes translated into comparable fatigue rates during the
Wingate test (−35.2 vs. −41.8%, respectively) despite children
taking more time to reach their maximal anaerobic power
output. This is consistent with experimental data obtained
by Hebestreit et al. (1993) and Harbili (2015) who indirectly
showed comparable fatigue rates during the Wingate test
between prepubertal boys (−44%) and professional male road
cyclists of Olympic and national levels (−43%). Based on these
data, it is presumed that the greater reliance on oxidative
energy sources and the lower relative anaerobic contribution
in well-trained adult endurance athletes (Pesta et al., 2013)
translate into a lower peripheral (i.e., muscular) fatigue, as
usually observed in prepubertal children compared to untrained
adults during repeated maximal voluntary muscle contractions
(Hatzikotoulas et al., 2014; Ratel et al., 2015). However, until
now the central and peripheral components of neuromuscular
fatigue during high-intensity exercise in well-trained adult
endurance athletes have only been compared to those of explosive
power-trained athletes (Garrandes et al., 2007) and not to
untrained adults. Further studies comparing the peripheral
and central components of neuromuscular fatigue between
prepubertal children, well-trained adult endurance athletes
and untrained adults are therefore required to check this
assumption.
CONCLUSION
The results of the present study showed a comparable net
contribution of energy derived from aerobic metabolism during
the Wingate test between prepubertal children and well-
trained adult endurance athletes. Furthermore, the post-exercise
recovery kinetics of oxygen uptake and HR were respectively
similar and faster in prepubertal children than well-trained adult
endurance athletes. The removal ability of lactate out of the blood
compartment was also higher in children than well-trained adult
endurance athletes. These results could explain why the rate and
magnitude of fatigue in prepubertal children are similar to well-
trained adult endurance athletes and why they recover faster from
high-intensity exercise than untrained adults.
PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS
On a more practical level, the results of the present study suggest
that prepubertal children may not have to perform specific
training to develop their aerobic metabolic competence. Other
strategies might be considered before puberty to improve exercise
performance, including entrainment of anaerobic systems and
movement technique training to improve mechanical efficiency.
In contrast, as the maturational and growth processes have
an adverse effect on oxidative energy production in exercising
muscle, aerobic training may be a high priority in pubertal and
post-pubertal children to maintain their aerobic potential and
delay the development of exercise-induced fatigue.
