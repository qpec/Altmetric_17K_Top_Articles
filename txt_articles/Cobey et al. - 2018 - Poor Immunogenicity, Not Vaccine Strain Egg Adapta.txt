Background. Influenza vaccination aims to prevent infection by influenza virus and reduce associated morbidity and mortality; 
however, vaccine effectiveness (VE) can be modest, especially for subtype A(H3N2). Low VE has been attributed to mismatches 
between the vaccine and circulating influenza strains and to the vaccine’s elicitation of protective immunity in only a subset of the 
population. The low H3N2 VE in the 2012–2013 season was attributed to egg-adaptive mutations that created antigenic mismatch 
between the actual vaccine strain (IVR-165) and both the intended vaccine strain (A/Victoria/361/2011) and the predominant cir-
culating strains (clades 3C.2 and 3C.3).
Methods. We investigated the basis of low VE in 2012–2013 by determining whether vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals 
were infected by different viral strains and by assessing the serologic responses to IVR-165, A/Victoria/361/2011, and 3C.2 and 3C.3 
strains in an adult cohort before and after vaccination.
Results. We found no significant genetic differences between the strains that infected vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals. 
Vaccination increased titers to A/Victoria/361/2011 and 3C.2 and 3C.3 representative strains as much as to IVR-165. These results 
are consistent with the hypothesis that vaccination boosted cross-reactive immune responses instead of specific responses against 
unique vaccine epitopes. Only approximately one-third of the cohort achieved a ≥4-fold increase in titer.
Conclusions. In contrast to analyses based on ferret studies, low H3N2 VE in 2012–2013 in adults does not appear to be due 
to egg adaptation of the vaccine strain. Instead, low VE might have been caused by low vaccine immunogenicity in a subset of the 
population.

 Vaccination is one of the most important public health interven-
tions to mitigate the annual threat of influenza. Each season, an 
estimated 4% of individuals aged <65 years seek outpatient care 
for influenza-related symptoms, and 12 000–56 000 people die 
from influenza infection in the United States [1, 2]. Vaccination 
in the US population has been increasing, with coverage in the 
2016–2017 season ranging from 76% in those aged 6–23 months 
to 33.6% in individuals aged 18 to 49 years and 65.3% in indi-
viduals aged ≥65 years [3]. However, the vaccine effectiveness 
(VE) continues to be modest, particularly against the A(H3N2) 
viruses, with a recent metaanalysis reporting pooled VE of 33% 
(95% confidence interval [CI], 26–39) for A(H3N2), 61% (57–
65) for A(H1N1pdm09), and 54% (46–61) for B [4].
What explains this modest effectiveness, particularly for the 
H3N2 subtype? A common explanation is that the vaccine and 
circulating strains are antigenically different, implying that vac-
cination protects against the vaccine strain but is less protective 
against antigenically distinct circulating strains. Metaanalyses have 
indicated that VE to antigenically drifted viruses is worse than to 
matched viruses [4, 5]. Mismatches can arise from inaccurate pre-
diction of the future strains that will dominate a season and/or the 
significant antigenic diversity of cocirculating strains [6–8].

Antigenic mismatches can also be caused by mutations that 
arise as human vaccine strains are propagated in fertilized chicken 
eggs for large-scale vaccine production [9, 10]. For example, the 
egg-adapted 2016–2017 H3N2 vaccine strain was antigenically 
distinct compared with circulating H3N2 strains due to a single 
hemagglutinin (HA) mutation that arose as the vaccine strain 
was adapted to replicate efficiently in eggs [10]. Many humans 
who received the 2016–2017 vaccine produced antibodies that 
recognized the egg-grown H3N2 vaccine strain but not circulat-
ing H3N2 strains [10]. It has been proposed that egg adaptations 
also contributed to lowered VE during the H3N2-dominated 
2012–2013 season [11], when influenza VE was estimated to 
be 39% (95% CI, 29–47) [12]. The 2012–2013 egg-adapted A/
Victoria/361/2011-IVR-165 (IVR-165) vaccine strain differed 
from the cell-cultured A/Victoria/361/2011 (Vic/361) strain 
at several residues in exposed regions of the HA head near the 
receptor-binding site (H156Q, G186V
, S219Y) [11].
Low VE during the 2012–2013 season might also have arisen 
from poor vaccine-induced protection in some hosts [13, 14]. 
Differences in VE by age [4, 12] have led to speculation that 
age-associated differences in infection and vaccination history 
[15, 16] affect protection [17, 18]. Notably, naive ferrets infected 
with IVR-165 developed titers that were 16- to 32-fold lower 
against Vic/361 compared with IVR-165, but naive ferrets 
infected with Vic/361 developed similar titers to both strains 
[11, 19]. People previously uninfected with H3N2 viruses who 
were immunized with the IVR-165 vaccine strain might have 
similarly distinct responses that neutralized the egg-adapted 
IVR-165 strain more efficiently than circulating H3N2 strains. 
It is unclear, however, if the IVR-165 vaccine strain would 
elicit this type of response in human adults who have had prior 
H3N2 exposures, as prior exposure might expand the range of 
responses to a vaccine [20–22].
To investigate the basis of the low VE against H3N2 in 2012–
2013, we first determined whether vaccinated and unvaccinated 
individuals were infected by different viral strains. If vaccinated 
people were infected with antigenically distinct strains, then 
low VE may be partially attributable to mismatch of some kind. 
We then evaluated the serologic responses to Vic/361, IVR-165, 
and representative circulating strains in an adult cohort before 
and after vaccination. If low VE arose from mismatch due to egg 
adaptations in IVR-165, we expected to see a robust response 
to IVR-165 but not to Vic/361 or circulating wild-type strains.
METHODS
Virus Specimens
The dataset comprises influenza A(H3N2) samples from 2012–
2013 collected for this study and sequences collated from online 
databases. The samples collected for this study were from clinical 
specimens identified as positive for influenza in the microbiology 
laboratories in 3 hospitals in Boston, Massachusetts (Brigham and 
Women’s Hospital, Massachusetts General Hospital, and Boston 
Children’s Hospital), 1 in Chicago, Illinois (University of Chicago 
Hospital), and 1 in Santa Clara, California (Stanford University 
Hospital). The cycle threshold value and the type and subtype 
of influenza were recorded, when available. Patient demograph-
ics (including gender and age) and vaccination status were doc-
umented based on review of medical records. The study was 
performed with institutional review board (IRB) approval from 
each participating institution (Partners Healthcare IRB protocol 
2013-P-000097/1; Boston Children’s Hospital IRB protocol IRB-
2013-P00007299; University of Chicago IRB protocol 13–0149; 
Stanford IRB protocol 27044). Sequences were also obtained 
from the National Center for Biotechnology Information influ-
enza virus database (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/
FLU/Database/nph-select.cgi?go=database). The query specified 
full-length HA H3N2 specimens from the United States from 1 
September 2012 to 1 June 2013. To these sequences, we added 23 
partial HA sequences from Dinis et al [23] for which the vaccina-
tion status of the infected individual was reported. We annotated 
the genome sequences by date and location of isolation, when 
available, as well as the vaccination status of the infected individ-
uals [12, 23].
Sequencing of the Influenza Genomes
The complete genomes of the influenza A viruses collected 
were sequenced as part of the National Institutes of Health, 
National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, sponsored 
Influenza Genome Sequencing Project. Viral RNA was isolated 
using the ZR 96 Viral RNA kit (Zymo Research Corporation, 
Irvine, California). The influenza A genomic RNA segments 
were simultaneously amplified from 3 µL of purified RNA using 
a multisegment reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction 
(M-RTPCR) strategy [24, 25]. The M-RTPCR amplicons were 
used as templates for Nextera Library construction, and librar-
ies were sequenced using the MiSeq v2 platform (Illumina, 
Inc., San Diego, California). The sequence reads from the 
MiSeq were sorted by barcode and trimmed, and noninflu-
enza sequences were removed. The next generation sequencing 
(NGS) reads were then mapped to the best matching reference 
virus using the clc_ref_assemble_long program. At loci where 
NGS platforms agreed on a variation (compared with the refer-
ence sequence), the reference sequence was updated to reflect 
the difference. A final mapping of all next-generation sequences 
to the updated reference sequences was then performed.
Phylogenetic Analysis
HA sequences from the full set of H3N2 influenza strains from 
2012–2013 were aligned using MUSCLE [26], and a maximum 
likelihood tree was generated using RAxML [27] with default 
options. Phylogenies and metadata were visualized in Phandango 
[28]. To determine the association of vaccination status and phy-
logeny, the Fitz and Purvis D statistic was calculated in R using 
 2012–2013 H3N2 Flu Vaccine Effectiveness • CID 2018:67 (1 August) • 329
phylo.d from the caper package [29] using a maximum likeli-
hood tree comprising the isolates with known vaccination status.
Human Participants and Sera
As part of a cohort study [30–32], blood was collected from 
61 adult participants from the Durham–Raleigh–Chapel Hill, 
North Carolina, area at the Duke Clinical Research Unit, Duke 
University Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina. Twenty-
eight participants were aged 30–40 years, and 33 were aged 
65–87 years. For some individuals, the volume of sera avail-
able limited the number of hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) 
assays that could be performed. Self-reported vaccination his-
tory was also available, and vaccination in 2011–2012 could be 
confirmed in participants who had enrolled in the study the 
previous year. Most individuals had been vaccinated at least 
once since 2009 before receipt of the 2012–2013 vaccine.
Ferret Sera
Sera isolated from 6 ferrets intranasally inoculated with a tis-
sue-culture grown preparation of A/Victoria/361/2012 was 
obtained from the International Reagent Resource (FR-1079). 
Sera isolated from 1 ferret intranasally inoculated with the A/
Victoria/361/2012 IVR-165 strain was kindly provided by Dr 
Xiyan Xu (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention).
Virus Propagation and Characterization
We used reverse genetics to produce viruses that expressed 
HA from Vic/361, IVR-165, and clades 3C.2 and 3C.3 repre-
sentatives (GenBank accessions CY171703.1 and CY170119.1, 
respectively). These viruses possessed the same Vic/361 NA and 
6 internal protein coding genes from the A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 
(H1N1) virus. The HAs of Vic/361 and IVR-165 differed at res-
idues 156 (H156Q), 186 (G186V), and 219 (S219Y). We propa-
gated viruses for 2 days using MDCK-SIAT1 cells (Madin-Darby 
canine kidney cells stably transfected with human 2,6-sialyl-
transferase), and we used standard Sanger sequencing to ver-
ify that other HA mutations did not predominate after virus 
propagation.
Hemagglutination Inhibition Assays
Sera were pretreated with receptor-destroying enzyme (Key 
Scientific Products, Inc., Stamford, Texas) and heat inactivated 
for 30 minutes at 55°C. Pretreated sera were incubated with a 
guinea pig erythrocyte solution (10% vol/vol) to remove serum 
components that bind erythrocytes. HAI titrations were per-
formed in 96-well V-bottom plates (Greiner, Monroe, North 
Carolina). Sera were serially diluted 2-fold and added to 4 agglu-
tinating doses of virus in a total volume of 100 µL. Guinea pig 
erythrocyte solution (12.5 µL; 2.5% vol/vol; Lampire, Pipersville, 
Pennsylvania) was added to sera–virus mixtures. Contemporary 
H3N2 viruses often acquire NA mutations during in vitro prop-
agation, and these mutations can confound HAI assays [33]. 
To verify that agglutination of guinea pig erythrocytes of our 
viral preps was HA mediated, we completed all HAI assays in 
the presence of 20 nM oseltamivir, a compound that binds in 
the sialic acid binding site of NA. Agglutination was read out 
after incubating erythrocytes for 1 hour at room temperature 
followed by tilting of the plates for 1 minute. HAI titers were 
expressed as the inverse of the highest dilution that inhibited 
4 agglutinating doses of guinea pig erythrocytes, measured by 
a full “tear drop pattern.” When a well showed a tear drop pat-
tern that was not full, the HAI titer was considered to be 0.75 
times the inverse of this dilution. For the analysis, HAI titers 
<20 were assigned values of 10. Titers to IVR-165 were similar 
regardless of whether the strain was grown in MDCK-SIAT1 
cells or eggs (Supplementary Figure 1), and the default analyses 
used titers to cell-grown IVR-165. There was also good agree-
ment between 2 replicate titer measurements (Supplementary 
Figure 2), and titers from the first replicate were used by default.
RESULTS
Similar H3N2 Strains Infected Vaccinated and Unvaccinated People
To determine whether vaccinated and unvaccinated individ-
uals were infected with different viral strains, we collated 423 
influenza A(H3N2) sequences from individuals with known 
vaccination status infected during the 2012–2013 season in the 
United States. This dataset comprised 316 specimens sequenced 
for the purposes of this study and 2 published collections [12, 
23] (Supplementary Table 1). Analysis of the HA sequences 
revealed no phylogenetic clustering by vaccination status 
(Figure 1), with the Fritz and Purvis [34] estimated D statistic 
of 0.93, consistent with a random association between vaccina-
tion status and the phylogeny. This is in keeping with a previous 
observation in which a smaller dataset was used [23].
Meaningful differences between the strains that infect vac-
cinated and unvaccinated individuals may be focused in sites 
within HA that impact antigenicity and avidity [35, 36]. To iden-
tify variable HA amino acid sites from the 2012–2013 influenza 
season, we assembled a dataset of 1339 complete HA sequences 
from the United States from 2012–2013 (Supplementary 
Table 2), including the set of 423 sequences described above, 
and determined the amino acid sites in which 20 or more spec-
imens differed from the vaccine strain IVR-165. We identified 
23 variable amino acid sites in HA1 and 4 variable sites in HA2 
(Figure 1) using these criteria. We then determined the haplo-
types of these 27 sites in individuals with known vaccination 
status, yielding 33 haplotypes. The frequency with which these 
haplotypes appeared ranged from rare (17 haplotypes appeared 
only once) to common (122 of the 423 samples shared the same 
haplotype at these variable sites; Supplementary Table 3). For 
the 3 most abundant haplotypes, we determined whether the 
samples from vaccinated individuals were overrepresented. 
A haplotype that contained HA2 V18M trended toward signifi-
cance (Bonferroni corrected p value of 0.1). However, 55 of 59 
isolates with this haplotype were from Boston, which had a high 
 330 • CID 2018:67 (1 August) • Cobey et al
ratio of vaccinated-to-unvaccinated individuals (1.7:1) com-
pared with other sites (0.8:1), indicating even less significance. 
Interestingly, the haplotype analysis revealed evidence of con-
vergent evolution, with identical amino acid variants appearing 
in multiple clades (eg, N225D appeared in clades 3C.3, 3C.2, 
and 5/6). Together, these data suggest that there are no statis-
tically significant differences in haplotypes between vaccination 
groups in a season that showed the emergence of new HA line-
ages (3C.2 and 3C.3). Rather, both vaccinated and unvaccinated 
individuals were infected with antigenically diverged clades.
Vaccination Boosts Serum Antibody Responses to Vaccine, Wild-Type, and 
Circulating Strains Equally
Because vaccinated people were infected with similar strains 
as unvaccinated people, antibody responses induced by the 
vaccine might have been very weak or they might have rec-
ognized epitopes present in the vaccine strain but absent in 
circulating strains. It has been proposed that egg adaptations 
in the IVR-165 vaccine strain contributed to low VE during 
the 2012–2013 season [11]. Consistent with previous reports 
 
[11, 19], we found that naive ferrets infected with IVR-165 
generated antibodies that reacted poorly with the wild-type 
Vic/361 strain (Supplementary Table 4). However, we found 
that vaccinated adult humans produced antibodies that rec-
ognized both Vic/361 and IVR-165, as well as strains from the 
dominant wild-type clades 3C.2 and 3C.3, which circulated that 
season (Figure 2 and Supplementary Figure 3). For these exper-
iments, we completed HAI assays using sera from adults before 
and after immunization with IVR-165.
Adults’ prevaccination titers were similar to all strains. 
Before vaccination, at least one-third of 57 adults had titers ≥40 
to Vic/361 (22 adults), IVR-165 (19 adults), a representative 
strain of clade 3C.2 (27 adults), and a representative strain of 
clade 3C.3 (19 adults; Figure 2). The prevaccination titers were 
correlated; for example, 16 of 22 individuals with titers ≥40 to 
Vic/361 had titers ≥40 to the other 3 strains.
After vaccination with IVR-165, titers to IVR-165 increased 
in 86% (48 of 56) of individuals and increased by at least 
4-fold in 36% (20 of 56). Strikingly, despite variation in indi-
vidual’s responses to IVR-165, there was a strong linear cor-
relation between the log2-fold changes in titer to IVR-165 and 
Vic/361 (Pearson correlation = 0.93 [CI, 0.88, 0.96], P < 10–15; 
Figure 2), including when the comparison to traditionally 
defined responders was restricted (Supplementary Figure 4).

The fold change distributions were not significantly different, 
although there was a trend toward greater boosting to Vic/361 
than IVR-165 (paired Wilcoxon signed rank test, approximate 
P value = .07). There were similarly strong linear correlations 
between individuals ’ antibody increases to IVR-165 and cir-
culating clades (Figure 2); again, the fold changes did not sig-
nificantly differ (with 3C.3, approximate P value = .52) or were 
slightly higher for the nonvaccine strain (for 3C.2, approximate 
P value = .11). Thus, regardless of strength, responses to the 
vaccine strain induced almost the same magnitude change that 
was seen in response to the wild-type and circulating strains, 
suggesting that the vaccine induced antibodies that cross-re-
acted with the other strains and effectively only antibodies that 
cross-reacted with the other strains. The strong correlations be-
tween prevaccine titers (Figure 2) suggest that these antibodies 
predated exposure to IVR-165.
Adults did not respond like naive ferrets, which developed 
4-fold greater responses to IVR-165 than to Vic/361 after vac-
cination with IVR-165 (Supplementary Table 4); no humans 
had fold changes to IVR-165 that were more than 2-fold greater

than changes to Vic/361. Of the 16 individuals who started 
with undetectable titers (<15) to both IVR-165 and Vic/361 
and who were thus possibly “naive” to these strains, all but 1 
had titers to Vic/361 that were at least as high as those to the 
vaccine strain.
DISCUSSION
Influenza VE measures how well a vaccine protects against 
diverse influenza viruses that circulate during a season. Given 
the high morbidity related to H3N2 infections [37, 38], there 
is a vital need to understand why this subtype has lower VE 
in order to guide improvement of influenza vaccines. The 2 
general explanations for why the vaccine fails to achieve high 
effectiveness are poor vaccine match, where “match” refers to 
the antigenic similarity between the vaccine and circulating 
influenza strains [4, 5], and heterogeneous responses to influ-
enza vaccination, such that the vaccine elicits protective immu-
nity in only some people [13, 14].
For the 2012–2013 influenza season, the H3N2 VE was esti-
mated to be 39% [12]. Antigenic data from ferrets support the 
contention that vaccination with the egg-adapted variants such 
as IVR-165 yield antibodies that react poorly with the intended 
Vic/361 vaccine strain. Under this model, the observed VE 
comes from mismatch with Vic/361, which presumably corre-
lates with the degree of mismatch with circulating strains. In 
theory, the VE would have been higher without the egg-adap-
tive mutations, although some mismatch between Vic/361 and 
circulating strains might have led to reduced effectiveness.
In contrast with the ferret data, we found that human adult 
responses to Vic/361, 3C.2, 3C.3, and IVR-165 strains before 
and after vaccination with IVR-165 were similar. We specu-
late that the differences between the specificity of antibodies 
elicited in ferrets and humans in our study are due to prior 
H3N2 exposures in humans. There is extensive evidence that 
B-cell responses to influenza strains evolve from preexisting 
responses [16, 17, 21, 39–41]. The immunological concept of 
“original antigenic sin” in fact arose partly from observations 
that influenza vaccination boosted responses that cross-react 
with previously encountered strains, leading to different pat-
terns of vaccine-induced cross-reactivity by cohort [20–22]. If 
preexisting responses are boosted exclusively, then adults may 
have failed to detect the antigenic novelty of Vic/361, even with-
out the egg adaptations. In contrast, egg adaptations may have 
been more recognizable in children due to their shorter expos-
ure history. Differences in the specific epitopes people target 
could have important consequences for protection and vaccine 
effectiveness [16, 40, 42].
Interaction between the type of egg-adaptive mutation and 
immune history may explain why egg adaptation apparently 
played a large role during the 2016–2017 season [10] but not the 
2012–2013 season. Notably, the 2016–2017 H3N2 vaccine strain 
possessed an egg-adapted HA mutation (T160K) that resulted in 
loss of a glycosylation site. Changes in HA glycosylation sites can 
have large antigenic impact. The 2012–2013 H3N2 egg-adapted 
vaccine possessed a mutation at HA residue 156 (H156Q), 
which is in the middle of an important antigenic site [36], but 
did not affect any of the glycosylation motifs on the HA. Prior 
exposures might have amplified the effects of these differences. 
Before the 2016–2017 season, many adults had already been 
exposed to H3N2 viruses that possessed HA with K160, and the 
egg-adapted 2016–2017 vaccine likely recalled memory B cells 
to this site. Adults thus boosted titers to the vaccine strain but 
not circulating strains, which were glycosylated at that site [10]. 
In contrast, before the 2012–2013 season, few adults had been 
exposed to H3N2 viruses that possessed HA with Q156, because 
these viruses had not circulated widely. Therefore, most adults 
probably did not have memory B cells against the egg-adapted 
HA epitope on the 2012–2013 H3N2 vaccine strain prior to the 
2012 season. They thus boosted responses to conserved epitopes 
that were also present on circulating strains.
We also observed heterogeneity in the extent of response to 
vaccination, with some individuals having persistently low HAI 
titers to the vaccine strain despite vaccination. There is accumu-
lating evidence that increased influenza exposure and older age, 
which are partly confounded variables [43], are associated with 
lower responses to vaccination. However, it is unclear why some 
individuals have lower titers than others after seemingly similar 
exposure histories.
There were no significant differences at the haplotype level 
between the strains that infected vaccinated vs unvaccinated 
people. Although this test lacks power, since vaccine recipi-
ents who became infected might have been those with a poor 
response to the vaccine, the results are consistent with the 
hypothesis that vaccination served merely to boost preexisting 
responses in a subset of the population.
Together, these data suggest that the low H3N2 VE in the 
2012–2013 season was not primarily attributable to egg-adapta-
tion mutations in the H3N2 vaccine strain. The widely variable, 
and still inexplicable, immunological responses to the vaccine 
in the vaccinated population might thus explain the low VE.
