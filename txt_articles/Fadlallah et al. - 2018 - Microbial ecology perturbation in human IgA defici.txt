Paradoxically, loss of immunoglobulin A (IgA), one of the most abundant antibodies, does not irrevocably lead to 
severe infections in humans but rather is associated with relatively mild respiratory infections, atopy, and auto­
immunity. IgA might therefore also play covert roles, not uniquely associated with control of pathogens. We show 
that human IgA deficiency is not associated with massive quantitative perturbations of gut microbial ecology. 
Metagenomic analysis highlights an expected pathobiont expansion but a less expected depletion in some typi­
cally beneficial symbionts. Gut colonization by species usually present in the oropharynx is also reminiscent of 
spatial microbiota disorganization. IgM only partially rescues IgA deficiency because not all typical IgA targets are 
efficiently bound by IgM in the intestinal lumen. Together, IgA appears to play a nonredundant role at the fore­
front of the immune/microbial interface, away from the intestinal barrier, ranging from pathobiont control and 
regulation of systemic inflammation to preservation of commensal diversity and community networks.
INTRODUCTION
Eukaryotes have developed spectacular ways not only to protect them-
selves from pathogens but also to benefit from unique and essential 
features of surrounding organisms (symbionts). Mammals are indeed 
highly dependent on their consortia of symbionts (microbiota) that 
serve both to optimize processing of nutrients and to protect from 
opportunistic agents by competition. Innate immune mechanisms con-
trolling host-microbiota mutualism are physically localized, activated 
by bacterial contact, culminating into breach of the gut mucosal firewall. 
Immediate nonspecific host responses involve the secretion of de-
fensins and the intraluminal recruitment of innate immune cells such 
as neutrophils that encapsulate commensals and limit their contact with 
surrounding gut epithelium (1). Such a potent response comes with a 
fitness cost to the commensal community and the benefits this brings 
to the host. It is therefore postulated that an evolutionary pressure took 
place to acquire mechanisms acting in the lumen, which would regulate 
microbial communities, thereby reducing the frequency of breaching 
the gut barrier and activation of innate immunity. This role could be 
played by antibodies and, most likely, by secretory immunoglobulin A 
(IgA) (2, 3). However, whereas antibody responses to pathogens 
have been intensively studied, much less interest has been devoted to 
the study of antibody relations with symbionts. Murine models of IgA 
deficiency (IgAd) have been studied and display modifications of the 
microbiome-immune interface. In such models, IgAd was obtained by 
inducing (i) defects in IgA class switch recombination (CSR) (4–6), (ii) 
defects in IgA transport into the gut lumen [pIgR−/− mice (7, 8) and 
J-chain−/− mice (9)], or (iii) reduction of IgA repertoire diversity with-
out altering IgA levels [(activation-induced cytidine deaminase knock-
in mutation (10), PD-1−/− mice (11), and FoxP3+CD4+–depleted mice 
(12)]. Models impairing CSR mechanisms (i) are associated with a gut 
dysbiosis defined by an expansion of anaerobes, predominantly seg-
mented filamentous bacteria (SFB) and Clostridiales, as well as nodular 
hyperplasia secondary to hyperactivation of germinal center B cells 
induced by microbial antigens (4, 5). Models impairing IgA secretion 
(ii) into the gut lumen were associated with altered microbiota compo-
sition, increased susceptibility to induced colitis, higher bacterial trans-
location to mesenteric lymph nodes after Salmonella typhimurium 
challenge, and lack of protective immunity against cholera toxin (7, 8). 
Notably, alterations of gut microbiota ecosystems were observed in 
the small intestine, whereas large intestine communities were much 
less affected by the absence of IgA (5), possibly because IgA predomi-
nantly targets commensal bacteria in the small intestine, but not in 
the colon, as shown by Bunker et al. (13) both in mice and in humans. 
Together, altered microbiome composition, increased susceptibility 
to microbial translocation, reduced microbial diversity, and reduced 
microbial fitness are shared features of IgA deficiency models.
These results are in line with the initial conception of IgA func-
tion, mainly presented as a neutralizing antibody, whose role would 
mainly be to exclude potentially harmful microbes and toxins from 
intimate contact with intestinal epithelia, thereby preserving mucosal 
barrier integrity (14). IgAd is relatively common in human adults, 
occurring in about 1 in 500 Caucasian individuals (15, 16). Although

human selective IgA deficiency (SIgAd) (that is, patients deficient for 
IgA but sufficient for all other antibody isotype) was, for a long time, 
considered asymptomatic, recent longitudinal studies have revealed 
that 80% of patients are symptomatic, when assessing complications 
more broadly (17) or when follow-up is extended (18). Human IgAd 
is associated with recurrent mucosal infections, autoimmunity, and 
intestinal disorders such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and 
lymphoid hyperplasia (19, 20). To explain the mild phenotype observed 
in SIgAd patients, it is proposed that IgM may effectively replace 
IgA as the predominant antibody in secretions (21, 22). However, if 
IgA indeed represents a merely redundant component of the immune 
system, then it appears paradoxical that it was so well conserved in 
evolution and that it is massively produced at the individual level [about 
66 mg/kg per day of IgA is secreted everyday (23)]. IgA also appears 
to orchestrate the beneficial tolerance established between the host 
and its gut commensal microbiome. These mutualistic host- 
microbial 
relationships were emphasized in animal models with an immune 
system reduced to a single monoclonal antibody of known bacterial 
specificity challenged by a limited microbial diversity. Although anti-
body binding was reducing bacterial fitness, it also resulted in reduced 
intestinal production of proinflammatory signals, hence allowing 
bacterial tolerance by the host (24). Similarly, flagellin-specific secre-
tory IgA (sIgA) may promote tolerance by reducing bacterial motility 
through modulation of flagellin transcription (25).
Although these models have provided important examples and 
possible mechanisms through which antibodies can imprint specific 
microbes, the targets of polyclonal IgA and their global impact on the 
microbiome remain poorly defined. Although it was recently shown 
in an animal model that IgA-coated bacteria include proinflammatory 
elements (26), it is not known whether IgA preferentially binds po-
tentially harmful bacteria and/or commensals (27). It is not known 
either whether IgM can indeed replace IgA at no expense to host/
bacterial homeostasis. Finally, the relations between SIgAd and sys-
temic autoimmunity are not well understood.
Here, we studied the composition of sIgA-bound gut microbiota in 
healthy individuals and evaluated alterations of this bacterial consor-
tium in SIgAd patients. To get insights into the specific contributions 
of IgA on host/microbial symbiosis, we also explored systemic im-
mune responses in these patients.
RESULTS
Patients lacking IgA-producing B cells and seric IgA also lack 
free and bacteria-bound digestive IgA
SIgAd represents a bioclinical entity that is defined by serologic means, 
namely, undetectable seric IgA titers (<0.07 mg/ml) with normal IgG 
concentration (28). SIgAd patients are known to present low or un-
detectable salivary IgA levels (21, 22), but their gut IgA status had not 
been assessed. We serologically confirmed a status of IgA deficiency in 
21 patients that could be included in this study because, among other 
exclusion criteria, they did not receive antibiotic treatment 3 months 
before inclusion. Compared to age- and sex-matched healthy donors 
(HDs) (n = 34), these SIgAd patients had undetectable seric (fig. S1A) 
and scarce digestive IgA levels [43 (0 to 206) g in HDs versus 0 
(0 to 21) g of free IgA per gram of stool in SIgAd, P < 0.0001; 
Fig. 1A], whereas their seric IgG levels were preserved (fig. S1B).
Circulating IgA+ B cells were undetectable in all patients except 
one [0.1 (0 to 1.3)% in SIgAd versus 7.1 (2.4 to 14.4)% in HDs, P < 
0.0001], whereas proportion of CD19+IgG+ cells among B cells was 
similar in both groups [12.55 (5.32 to 29.6)% versus 13.1 (0.793 to 
37.6)%, P = 0.8004; Fig. 1B]. Compared to controls, SIgAd patients 
are also characterized by a depletion of CD19+CD27+IgD− switched 
memory B cells among total CD19+ B cells [20 (5.17 to 34.1)% versus 
14.9 (3.3 to 38.1)%, P = 0.0328; Fig. 1C]. These data show that sIgA 
deficiency affects both peripheral blood and distant organs, such as 
the intestine, at both the cellular and the protein level.
The clinical spectrum of digestive SIgAd-associated symptoms 
varies from very mild to severe, and it remains unknown whether 
residual digestive IgA would account for pauci-symptomatic presen-
tations. We therefore used a flow cytometry assay, derived from our 
previously published technology (29), to test whether traces of IgA 
might be detected at the surface of the fecal microbiota, although free 
digestive IgA is usually not detectable in SIgAd, as shown above. The 
protocol was modified to assess levels of mucosal antibodies targeting 
colonic microbiota in vivo (Fig. 1D). IgA, as the main mucosal anti-
body in HDs, binds a median percentage of 7.6 (0.8 to 17.6)% of the 
whole fecal microbiota (Fig. 1D). Close examination of flow cytom-
etry profiles also reveals that IgA-bound microbiota can be sub-
divided into IgAdim and IgAbright bacterial populations (Fig. 1D, left). 
These IgA+ subsets were absent in all SIgAd patients except one (P < 
0.0001; Fig. 1D, right). Notably, this patient also had detectable IgA+ 
circulating B cells (Fig. 1B). This interesting case confirms that some 
patients diagnosed with SIgAd by serologic means indeed retain sIgA, 
which can be detected by the very sensitive bacterial flow cytometry 
technique. These data nevertheless establish that microbiota-bound 
IgA is usually undetectable in SIgAd patients.
Global microbiome diversity is preserved  
in SIgAd patients
To study the global impact of digestive IgA deficiency on the gut 
microbiome, we performed shotgun sequencing (30, 31) of fecal sam-
ples in 34 HDs and 17 SIgAd patients. High-quality reads from each 
sample were mapped to a reference catalog of 3.9 million genes (32). 
Taxonomic abundances were computed at the level of co-abundance 
gene groups (CAGs) and, subsequently, binned at broader taxonomic 
levels (genus, family, order, class, and phylum). CAGs contain at least 
50 different genes. Metagenomic species (MGSs) are defined as larger 
CAGs with very high connectivity and a defined minimal size of at least 
700 genes. This approach to study microbiome composition presents 
the advantage to overcome the limited resolution of previous methods 
used for metagenomic or 16S amplicon data analysis that rely on 
comparisons to reference genomes, offering the possibility to com-
prehensively profile the diversity of a clinical sample and to poten-
tially identify previously uncharacterized microbes (32).
Metagenomic analysis revealed a similar representation of the 
dominant phyla in the two groups [HDs versus SIgAd: 44.55% versus 
45.52% (P = 1) for Bacteroidetes, 50.52% versus 48.35% (P = 0.7774) 
for Firmicutes, 2.19% versus 3% (P = 1) for Proteobacteria, 0.65% 
versus 0.84% (P = 0.99) for Actinobacteria, and 1.5% versus 1.41% 
(P = 1) for unclassified phyla; fig. S2A]. Microbiota diversity was not 
different between the two groups, either when including all MGS 
regardless of their phylum [median Shannon index, HDs versus SIgAd: 
4.008 (2.501 to 4.698) versus 3.946 (1.690 to 4.511), P = 0.6344] or when 
comparing MGS diversity within each phylum [HDs versus SIgAd: 
2.529 (1.225 to 3.380) versus 2.564 (0.8064 to 3.234), P = 0.8180 for 
Bacteroidetes; 3.978 (3.067 to 4.619) versus 3.779 (2.735 to 4.286), 
P = 0.05 for Firmicutes; 1.688 (1.170 to 2.223) versus 1.699 (0.5898 to 
2.131), P = 0.8421 for Actinobacteria; 1.432 (0.1518 to 2.132) versus

1.432 (0.3349 to 2.014), P = 0.9042 for Proteobacteria; and 2.283 
(0.6089 to 2.830) versus 2.032 (1.161 to 2.687), P = 0.1357 for un-
classified phyla; fig. S2B]. Furthermore, no significant difference was 
observed in terms of median MGS richness between the two groups 
[454 (215 to 694) different MGS detected in HDs versus 451 (160 to 641) 
in patients, P = 0.7553; fig. S2C] nor in gene count [395841 (236166 
to 636394) genes in HDs versus 379482 (248232 to 514298) genes in 
patients, P = 0.4167; fig. S2C]. To estimate the stability of the gut 
microbiota profiles, we analyzed the gut microbiota composition of 
three healthy subjects sampled longitudinally (two samples, 12 months 
apart). Hierarchical cluster analysis outlines strong structural intra-
individual sample proximity, suggesting overall temporal stability of 
individual gut microbiota profiles, at least in healthy subjects (fig. S3). 
Together, these data reveal that the diversity of SIgAd and control 
fecal bacterial repertoires does not differ significantly. Our data also 
suggest that an individual’s profile remains stable over time.
IgA deficiency gut microbiota displays mild dysbiosis
We reasoned that IgA deficiency might affect relatively discrete bac-
terial populations, without affecting global microbiome structure at 
the analysis level applied above. A gene biomarker approach (33) was 
used to determine which bacteria were expanded or depleted in IgA 
deficiency, comparing the whole unsorted microbiota of 34 HDs with 
17 SIgAd patients (fig. S4). We found 31 differential MGSs between 
the two groups; 17 being were overrepresented, whereas 14 were un-
derrepresented in SIgAd patients. Differential MGSs, between controls 
and patients, were ranked according to increasing statistical signifi-
cance (Fig. 2A). Most MGSs depleted in IgA deficiency (13 of 14) 
belong to the Firmicutes phylum, whereas only one belongs to the 
Bacteroidetes phylum. Among depleted Firmicutes, more than half 
of them (7 of 13) belong to the Lachnospiraceae family, and two are 
Ruminococcaceae (Faecalibacterium genus, n = 2 of 2) (Fig. 2B).
Conversely, among the 17 expanded MGSs in IgA deficiency, 10 are 
Firmicutes, 4 are Bacteroidetes, and 3 are Proteobacteria (Gamma-
proteobacteria exclusively, including Escherichia coli). These 17 MGSs 
belong to 11 different families and, thus, are more diverse than depleted 
species. Three of seventeen expanded MGSs are usually present in 
the oropharynx flora (Streptococcus sanguinis, Veillonella parvula, and 
Haemophilus parainfluenzae). In addition, we found two different 
species of Prevotella to be overrepresented in SIgAd (compare Fig. 2A).
IgA targets more likely decline than expand  
in the absence of IgA
We then postulated that microbial ecology perturbation in the ab-
sence of IgA might be appreciated in a different manner if we could 
focus on bacteria, more specifically, IgA-targeted in healthy controls. 
We previously verified that metagenomic analysis could reliably be 
performed on sorted bacterial subsets with a determined lowest ana-
lyzable sample size of 108 bacteria (34). IgA+ fractions were enriched 
by magnetic sorting in 30 healthy controls, allowing IgA+ and IgA− 
fraction sequencing and differential metagenomic analysis (Fig. 3A). 
The same gene biomarker identification approach as above (fig. S4) 
allowed the identification of 24 different MGS overrepresented in the 
IgA+ fraction of healthy controls (fig. S5). These “IgA+ MGSs” were 
ranked according to increasing statistical significance at the lowest tax-
onomic level available (Fig. 3B). Among the 24 IgA+ MGSs, 19 belong to 
the Firmicutes phylum (among which 12 belong to the Clostridia class, 
1 of these 12 belonging to the Faecalibacterium genus), 2 are bacteria 
from unclassified phylum, 1 is Proteobacteria (one E. coli species), 1 be-
longs to the Actinobacteria phylum (Bifidobacterium bifidum), and 
the last identified MGS belong to the Bacteroidetes phylum (Fig. 3C). 
We finally compared the prevalence of IgA+ MGSs between SIgAd 
patients and controls and found that the prevalence of only four of 
them was significantly altered (Fig. 3D). Whereas E. coli (CAG 4) was

found to be expanded in patients, we rather observed that Coprococcus 
comes (CAG 19), Clostridium sp. (CAG 138), and Dorea sp. (CAG 73) 
were depleted in SIgAd (Fig. 3E). Together, the prevalence of most 
IgA+ MGSs does not vary significantly in SIgAd. Furthermore, an 
IgA+ MGS does not systematically expand in the context of SIgAd.
IgM digestive secretion partially rescues microbiota 
antibody coating in SIgAd patients
We then postulated that compensatory immune mechanisms might 
explain why IgA deficiency is not associated with massive perturba-
tions of gut microbial ecology, as previously suggested (21, 22, 35). 
Microbial flow cytometry analysis was used to detect other antibody iso-
types on the surface of SIgAd microbiomes. IgM was indeed detected at 
the surface of SIgAd microbiota in all SIgAd patients analyzed (Fig. 4A). 
IgM bound 6.26 (0.625 to 45)% (n = 21) of the whole microbiome in 
patients, whereas IgM binding was observed in minimal amounts in 
only 2 of 34 healthy controls [0.05 (0 to 2.4)%, P < 0.0001; Fig. 4B]. 
Measured free fecal IgM levels were consistent with IgM-bound levels 
[0.83 (0 to 28.1) g and 39.9 (0 to 436.1) g of free IgA per gram of 
feces in HDs and SIgAd patients, respectively, P = 0.0004; Fig. 4B].

In blood, so-called IgM-only B cells (36) (CD19+CD27+IgM+IgD−) 
were increased in patients [5.67 (2.88 to 12.73)% in HDs versus 9.14 
(3.83 to 43.75)% in SIgAd patients, P = 0.0048], whereas marginal zone-
like cells (CD19+CD27+IgM+IgD+) are similar in both groups [40.2 
(17.8 to 66.3)% and 38.85 (9.29 to 76.8)% in HDs and SIgAd patients, 
respectively, P = 0.7588; Fig. 4C]. Therefore, in the absence of IgA, 
IgM is secreted to the digestive tract, where it binds gut commen-
sals. Our data also suggest that CD19+CD27+IgM+IgD− B cell expan-
sion could account for this compensatory measure.
We then asked whether IgM could be looked upon as a surrogate 
for IgA at the immune-microbiota interface. To test whether IgM and 
IgA bind overlapping repertoires of bacteria, we separated IgM+ and 
IgM− bacteria from patient’s microbiomes (n = 10) using flow cy-
tometry. Metagenomic analysis could not be performed on sorted 
samples because the lowest analyzable sample size of 108 bacteria 
was not reached for all IgM+ fractions. Bacterial fractions were then 
identified by 16S rRNA sequencing (Fig. 4D, top). Hierarchical clus-
tering of n = 33 dominant taxa abundance ratios [log2 (IgM+/IgM−)] 
displays no evidence of a common pattern of IgM recognition (Fig. 4D, 
middle). Thus, much like IgA responses (fig. S6), IgM responses also 
seem to be highly variable interindividually.
We then focused our analysis on the taxa bound by SIgA, or dif-
fering between HDs and SIgAd patients, (confer Figs. 3B and 2A, 
respectively). Using the median log2 (IgM+/IgM−) ratios of all the 
donors, we found that (i) Veillonellaceae family, Prevotella genus, 
Porphyromonadaceae family, Pseudomonas genus, Lachnospira ge-
nus, Faecalibacterium genus, Clostridium genus, Bifidobacterium 
genus, and Bacteroides genus are overrepresented in IgM+ fraction; 
(ii) Enterobacteriaceae family, Streptococcus genus, Ruminococcus 
genus, Dorea genus, Coprococcus genus, and Blautia genus are 
overrepresented in IgM− fraction; and (iii) Acinetobacter genus, 
Erysipelotrichaceae family, Anaerostipes genus, Eubacterium genus

are equally present in both fractions (Fig. 4D, bottom). Paired analysis 
performed on these 19 taxa revealed that Clostridium and Pseudomonas 
genera are significantly enriched in the IgM+ fraction (P = 0.013). Bac-
teria belonging to the Enterobacteriaceae family are poorly bound by 
IgM. Together, not all typical IgA targets are bound by digestive IgMs 
in SIgAd patients (Fig. 4E).
IgM responses are correlated with commensal  
diversity in IgA deficiency
Given that the recent literature substantiates that IgA shapes microbiota 
composition and diversity in mice (12), we wanted to know whether 
IgM could play this role in IgA deficiency. Median gut IgM+ enrich-
ment ratios based on operational taxonomic unit (OTU) abundances 
calculated at phylum level in IgM+- and IgM−-sorted fractions were 
correlated with the Shannon diversity index (fig. S2B) within each 
dominant phylum in nine SIgAd patients (Fig. 5A). As shown, IgM+ 
enrichment ratio is positively correlated with Actinobacteria phy-
lum diversity (Spearman coefficient, r = 0.7167; P = 0.0369), whereas 
no statistical correlation is observed for the three other dominant phyla. 
Notably, the very narrow range of IgM binding to Firmicutes, and to 
some extent Proteobacteria, might have precluded identification of po-
tential correlations between IgM binding and diversity in these phyla.

Serum IgM responses against two strains belonging to the Actinobacte-
ria phylum (Bifidobacterium adolescentis and Bifidobacterium longum) 
were confirmed in 16 HDs by flow cytometry (fig. S7A). We then pos-
tulated that Actinobacteria diversity could be further reduced in the 
absence of IgM. We therefore explored CVID patients with total IgA 
deficiency and very low or undetectable IgM digestive levels [0 (0 to 
115) g of free IgM per gram of stool; fig. S7B]. As expected, IgM 
gut microbiota binding is minimal [0.297 (0.08 to 3.84)%, n = 15; 
fig. S7C] in CVID. Shotgun sequencing of the whole CVID gut mi-
crobiota and metagenomic analysis (Fig. 5B) suggested a significant 
global loss of MGS richness [454 (305 to 590) in HDs (n = 34) versus 
375 (294 to 491) in CVID (n = 7), P = 0.0615; Fig. 5C]. A significant 
loss in Actinobacteria phylum diversity was observed in these patients 
[Shannon diversity index, 1.688 (1.170 to 2.223) in HDs versus 1.342 
(0.319 to 1.827) in CVID; P = 0.05]. A loss, yet more moderate, of the 
Firmicutes phylum diversity was also observed (P = 0.065; Fig. 5D). 
Together, the data suggest that, in the absence of intestinal IgA, IgM 
binding preserves Actinobacteria diversity, although this conclusion 
needs to be validated on a larger CVID cohort.
IgA deficiency is associated with systemic inflammation
We then asked whether the lack of sIgA could induce perturbations 
in host systemic inflammatory versus regulatory responses, in spite 
of the presence of mucosal IgM responses. Cytokine-secreting cir-
culating CD4+ T cells were measured in both groups (Fig. 6A). Pro-
portions of interferon- (IFN-)+CD4+ T cells were not different [14.6 
(3.3 to 25.7)% in HDs versus 16.75 (2.28 to 47.8)% in SIgAd, P = 
0.3932], whereas interleukin-17 (IL-17)+CD4+ and IL-22+CD4+ 
T cells were increased in IgA deficiency [0.422 (0.04 to 1.96)% ver-
sus 1.49 (0.06 to 3.65)%, P = 0.0137 and 0.136 (0.06 to 0.769)% ver-
sus 0.866(0.02 to 4)%, P = 0.0104, respectively]. Double-positive 
IL-17+IL- 
22+ CD4+ T cells were also increased in IgA deficiency 
[0.05 (0.02 to 0.44)% versus 0.2 (0 to 0.75)%, P = 0.0058]. Seric 
IL-6, IL-10, and IL-17 concentrations were all elevated in patients 
[0.6 (0.33 to 2.4) pg/ml versus 1 (0.25 to 34.37) pg/ml (P = 0.0315), 
0.47 (0 to 1.41) pg/ml versus 0.87 (0.37 to 5.2) pg/ml (P = 0.0001), and 
0.06 (0 to 1.47) pg/ml versus 0.21 (0.007 to 0.92) pg/ml (P = 0.0215), 
respectively; Fig. 6B]. sCD14 was increased in patient’s sera [2063 
(1147 to 4283] pg/ml versus 2841 (1399 to 5187) pg/ml, P = 0.0023; 
Fig. 6C], although LPS concentration was not significantly increased 
in the same samples [54.15 (23.40 to 77.92) versus 48.10 (34.57 to 
97.33); Fig. 6C]. We also observed an increase in CD4+PD-1+ cells 
[7.11 (1.86 to 16.9)% versus 14 (3.13 to 31.6)%, P = 0.0093; Fig. 6C] 
in SIgAd patients. The circulating regulatory T cell (Treg) compartment 
was not altered by IgA deficiency, because frequency of naïve Tregs 
(CD45RA+FoxP3+ CD4+ T cells), effector Tregs (CD45RA−FoxP3bright 
CD4+ T cells), and activated conventional T cells (CD4+CD45RA−
FoxP3low) was similar between patients and controls (Fig. 6D). Thus, 
SIgAd patients display a circulating skewed CD4+ T cell pheno-
type toward T helper 17 (TH17) differentiation associated with an 
increase of seric sCD14, which is a marker of monocyte activation. 
Patients with malabsorption were excluded from the study because mu-
cosal defects might grossly affect gut microbial ecology. We stratified 
patients in an effort to determine whether other clinical features such 
as infection, autoimmunity, or historic antibiotic treatments (at least 
3 months before sampling) might be preferentially associated with in-
flammation. We found no correlations between clinical status and any 
of the elevated immunological markers mentioned above (Fig. 6, A to 
D). Together, the immunological and inflammatory modifications as-
sociated with SIgAd are not contributed by isolated patients presenting 
“extreme” clinical phenotypes.
IgA deficiency is associated with a disturbed  
bacterial dependency network
Bacterial symbiosis in the human gut notably implies that some bacteria 
depend on other bacteria for their persistence. Within such networks, and 
by definition, a dependent bacterium, called “satellite,” never occurs 
independently of another, coined “host,” in a given sample. Conversely, 
the same host may occur in a given sample independently of its satellites 
(Fig. 7A). This concept was initially promoted by Nielsen et al. (32), 
who identified a minimal obligatory network of 45 MGS-MGS de-
pendency associations involving 60 MGSs (the same MGS can make 
several associations). To investigate the potential impact of IgA defi-
ciency on bacterial dependency associations, we tested whether this 
minimal obligatory network was disturbed in IgA deficiency.
Main links defined by Nielsen et al. (32) were confirmed in HDs 
(90 to 100%), whereas the confirmed link percentage was more dis-
persed in SIgAd patients, ranging from 75 to 100% (Fig. 7B). On the 
basis of our HD MGS-MGS co-presence distribution, the 99% con-
fidence interval was calculated according to a  distribution defining a 
lower threshold of 84% of MGS-MGS co-presence, below which the 
population-level link was considered absent. In our HD cohort, 41 of 
45 links were maintained at population level, whereas only 30 links 
were confirmed in SIgAd patients. The 11 links lost in SIgAd patients 
involved 21 MGS: 7 Faecalibacterium sp., 4 Firmicutes, 2 Clostrid-
iales, 2 Ruminococcus sp., 2 Prevotella, 2 Butyricimonas virosa, and 
2 unknown MGSs (data file S1).
The resulting network of remaining bacterial dependencies for 
HDs and SIgAd patients is shown in Fig. 7C. In summary, IgA defi-
ciency is associated with a disturbed bacterial dependency associa-
tion network.
DISCUSSION
Similar to what was observed in murine models of IgAd (5), we found 
that IgA deficiency does not markedly alter global fecal microbiota 
composition in affected patients. However, our observations are limited 
to feces, and a more severe dysbiosis may be present in the small intes-
tine, as shown in mouse models of IgA deficiency (5, 11–13). The com-
bination of flow cytometry and metagenomic analysis proved useful to 
increase the resolution of the analysis on human fecal samples by 
monitoring alterations of commensals specifically bound by sIgA in 
healthy controls. More work will be necessary to determine whether 
IgAdim and IgAbright bacterial populations correspond to bacteria bound 
by high- versus low-affinity IgA, respectively, and whether these subsets 
have overlapping bacterial repertoires or not. Notably, IgA interac-
tions with very low affinity are also suggested and could account for 
the very discrete, but global, bacterial flow cytometry profile shift 
consistently observed in HDs but not observed in SIgAd patients.
It could have been expected that commensals bound by sIgA in 
healthy subjects would all tend to expand in IgAd patients. In mu-
rine models of immune deficiency, IgA targets, such as SFB (26), ex-
pand in the absence of an effective IgA response (4, 12). We rather 
observed that MGSs defined in Fig. 3B as main IgA targets in controls 
do not systematically bloom in SIgAd patients. Most notably, C. comes 
(CAG 19) is underrepresented in SIgAd patients compared to con-
trols. By contrast, another typical IgA target, such as E. coli (CAG 4), is 
overrepresented in SIgAd patients by an order of magnitude, compared

to controls. These data suggest that E. coli (CAG 4) expansion in the micro-
biota could indeed be negatively influenced by sIgA, whereas C. comes 
thrives in the presence of sIgA. More generally, at the family level, we ob-
serve that IgA+ bacteria are more likely found to be underrepresented 
than overrepresented in SIgAd patients. These data emphasize the 
protective role that sIgA directly (or indirectly) plays in humans on 
commensal ecology, as previously observed in animal models (12).
Using the gene biomarker analytical approach described in Qin et al. 
(33), we identified bacterial targets of sIgA in HDs by meta 
genomic anal-
ysis of microbiota preparations enriched for sIgA-bound commensals.

Notably, enriched samples retained detectable levels of non– 
IgA- 
bound 
commensals. This analytical approach (33) was chosen, because it 
allows identification based on differential abundance, which is less 
sensitive to sample purity. We show that sIgA targets preferentially 
Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, and Proteobacteria, whereas Bacteroidetes 
are largely underrepresented compared to total microbiota composition. 
Only 1 of the 24 MGSs identified as preferred sIgA targets belongs 
to the Bacteroidetes phylum, despite its dominance in the human 
colon. Our results are consistent with previous mouse (12, 26) and 
human (26, 37–40) studies.
Although preferred IgA targets belong to the Firmicutes phylum, 
underrepresented bacteria in SIgAd patients are also Firmicutes, such 
as Faecalibacterium, a genus well known to exert anti-inflammatory 
effects on the gut mucosa (41) and which is notably depleted in IBDs 
(42, 43). Conversely, potentially proinflammatory Gammaproteo-
bacteria and Prevotella (44) are overrepresented in SIgAd patients. 
Overrepresented bacteria are more diverse than underrepresented 
bacteria. Three MGSs usually belonging to the oral flora (V. parvula, 
S. sanguinis, and H. parainfluenzae) are overrepresented in gut mi-
crobiomes of SIgAd patients. These bacteria are involved in biofilm 
formation and could exert inflammatory effects (45, 46). V. parvula 
has also been described as responsible for sepsis in an X-linked 
agammaglobulinemia patient (47). Finally, the genera usually de-
scribed as pathogenic in patients (Salmonella and Campylobacter) 
were not found to be overrepresented.
Overall, we observed depletion of anti-inflammatory species, an 
expansion of proinflammatory species, and a lower digestive tract 
localization of constituents of the oral flora in IgAd patients. It was 
recently shown that ectopic localization of human salivary microbiota 
can elicit severe gut inflammation in susceptible host animals (48). 
It is therefore possible that ectopic oral microbiota could also exert 
a proinflammatory role in the context of SIgAd.

Mechanisms underlying these findings are unknown, but one could 
speculate that sIgA, on the one hand, excludes (14, 49) and facilitates 
elimination of fast-growing pathobionts (50). On the other hand, sIgA 
could protect commensals by agglutination (51) and by localizing 
these bacteria in a favorable habitat like the mucus (fig. S8). Finally, 
IgA-mediated “intraluminal trapping” effects should prevent intimate 
bacterial proximity with the epithelial barrier and, therefore, host in-
flammation and associated negative effects on commensals.
In SIgAd patients, we show that the microbiota remains substan-
tially bound by IgM. This observation, together with the recent char-
acterization of dually coated (IgA+ IgM+) mucus-embedded bacteria 
with increased richness compared to IgA-only–coated bacteria (52), 
suggests that IgM may compensate IgA deficiency. We show that 
microbial IgM binding is highly variable between patients. When 
focusing the analysis on commensals bound by sIgA in healthy sub-
jects, or on differential genera between healthy controls and SIgAd 
patients, we noticed that IgM, like IgA, tends to preferentially bind 
Clostridium, Bifidobacterium, and Faecalibacterium (all Gram-positive 
bacteria). However, we show that IgM does not bind Enterobacteriaceae, 
nor Prevotellaceae families, which are overrepresented in SIgAd pa-
tients and involved in proinflammatory events (44). These data sug-
gest that IgM is only partially efficient at controlling pathobionts,

accounting for the susceptibility to enteropathogens in SIgAd. Our data 
suggest that sIgA has the same positive impact at least on Firmicutes and 
Actinobacteria diversity in humans, whereas IgM would only favor the 
latter. Notably, the very narrow range of IgM binding to Firmicutes, and 
to some extent Proteobacteria, might have precluded identification of po-
tential correlations between IgM binding and diversity in these phyla.
In an effort to determine whether Actinobacteria diversity would also 
be lost in the absence of IgM, we studied CVID gut microbiomes. We 
observed that Actinobacteria diversity is drastically decreased in CVID, 
an “IgM-deficient” model. Moreover, a similar trend is observed for 
Firmicutes. These results were confirmed in an independent CVID 
study. Jørgensen et al. (53) recently showed that CVID patients display 
dysbiotic gut microbiota with reduced  diversity, reduced abun-
dance of Actinobacteria, and increased abundance of Gammaproteo-
bacteria. It should be underlined that, although we took care to include 
CVID that did not receive antibiotics within 3 months before sam-
pling, the analysis of CVID patients is potentially hampered by several 
confounders such as previous antibiotic courses and other treatments. 
It is, however, interesting to note that Actinobacteria diversity is 
preferentially decreased in two independent CVID studies, whereas 
other phyla are comparatively less affected in this IgM-deficient co-
hort, while, allegedly, confounding factors might have similarly af-
fected all phyla. There is clinical relevance for this concept because it 
is well established that patients selectively lacking IgA rarely develop 
IBD, whereas this complication is more frequent and severe in those 
lacking both IgA and IgM (54).
The impact of IgA deficiency on bacterial symbiosis is further evi-
denced by the perturbation of bacterial networks. The presence in 
SIgAd patients of satellite bacteria (such as CAG 97, CAG 133, CAG 
488, CAG 206, and CAG 328), in the absence of their previously de-
scribed host (32), most probably reflects the establishment of novel 
dependency links. Such modifications underscore the role played by 
IgA well beyond its recognized neutralizing activity.
SIgAd has also profound systemic repercussions. The TH17 bias that 
we observed is potentially connected to intestinal dysbiosis because 
Klemola et al. (55) have already shown the presence of activated 
T cells in gut mucosa of IgAd patients. As described by Perreau et al. 
(56), in CVID, CD4+PD-1+ cells are increased in SIgAd patients. Al-
though LPS was not found to be elevated in SIgAd serum, increased 
sCD14 and PD-1 up-regulation could reflect T cell exhaustion in-
duced by repeated bacterial translocation (57). Finally, and from a 
therapeutic perspective, a much larger cohort of patients would be 
needed to extract a potentially beneficial microbial signature associ-
ated with elevated IL-10 observed in some patients.
Together, we show that SIgAd in humans is associated with a mild 
intestinal dysbiosis, characterized by expansion of proinflammatory 
bacteria, depletion of anti-inflammatory commensals, and a pertur-
bation in the “obligatory” bacterial network. Dysbiosis could be partly 
explained by the fact that IgA deficiency is not totally compensated 
by IgM secretion and by the loss of a nonredundant chaperone-like 
effect of IgA on microbial diversity.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study design
Patients and controls
We conducted a cross-sectional study of patients with IgA deficiency 
compared to healthy controls. Fresh stool and blood samples were 
collected simultaneously at a single time point in 21 patients with 
SIgAd (table S1) and compared with 34 age- and sex-matched HDs 
(Table 1). We furthermore recruited seven CVID patients with IgA, IgG, 
and/or IgM deficiency, thus displaying a global antibody production 
defect. Patients were recruited from two French referral centers of clin-
ical immunology (Department of Clinical Immunology in Saint Louis 
Hospital and Department of Internal Medicine in Pitié-Salpêtrière 
Hospital, Paris), where they were followed for clinical manifestations 
associated with antibody deficiencies. IgAd patient’s inclusion criteria 
were undetectable seric IgA levels (<0.07 mg/ml) in at least three pre-
vious samples in the past year. SIgAd is defined by serological means, 
namely, undetectable seric IgA titers (<0.07 mg/ml) with normal IgG 
levels. CVID patients are characterized by a marked decrease of seric 
IgG (at least 2 SD below the age-dependent mean) and a marked de-
crease in at least one of the isotypes IgM or IgA. For our study, we 
furthermore requested that the patients should be deficient in seric 
IgA (<0.07 mg/ml).
Exclusion criteria
Antibiotic therapy and laxative drugs use in the last 3 months before 
stool collection (inclusion for metagenomic analysis: 17 SIgAd patients, 
7 CVID, and 34 HDs). Clinical and biological data were collected at in-
clusion time. Oral and written consent were obtained from patients 
before inclusion in the study.
Bioinformatical analysis
CAGs matrix construction
The projection of genes into CAGs was performed using a predefined 
list of 7381 CAGs (32). Every predefined CAG is a vector of genes 
ordered by increasing connectivity. For a bacterial genome, the most 
connected genes correspond to the marker genes present in all indi-
viduals carrying this organism (core genome). Starting with the gene 
frequency matrix, we projected the list of connected genes in each 
predefined CAG and extracted the corresponding frequency profile 
of the 50 most connected ones. Provided that at least 10% of marker 
genes are found, each frequency profile was used to compute the mean 
vector corresponding to the CAG frequency.
Differential CAGs identification
Genes from the gene profile matrix were used to identify those that 
were differentially abundant between the SIgAd patients and HD groups 
as described in (30). Briefly, Wilcoxon tests were used to compute the 
probabilities that gene frequency profiles did not differ between SIgAd 
patients and HD groups by chance alone. Benjamini and Hochberg 
multiple-test correction was applied to the P values. By performing a 
selection based on a significance threshold of P < 0.01, we identified 
18,025 genes that were differentially abundant between the two groups. 
The same method and P value were applied to identify the differen-
tially abundant genes between the IgA+/IgA− fractions in HDs. We 
identified 110,558 genes that were differentially abundant between 
the two groups. In a second step, the differentially abundant genes 
were projected into CAGs defined in the 3.9 million genes catalog. 
To validate a differential CAG, we used a threshold with a minimum 
of 50 differentially abundant genes per CAG (CAGs are kept only if 
they are equal to or exceed 50 connected genes) including at least 
10% of marker genes. The frequency profile of the 50 most connected 
genes was used to compute the mean vector corresponding to the 
CAG frequency. Of the 18,025 differential genes between SIgAd pa-
tients and HDs, 8191 fell into 33 CAGs composed of 53 to 997 genes 
after the projection step (fig. S2B and data file S2). Thirty-one of 
the 33 CAGs are considered as MGS according to their gene size 
(≥700 genes). For the IgA+ and IgA− fraction comparisons, 80,415 of

110,558 differential genes fell into 119 CAGs of 50 to 3105 genes each. 
Thirty CAGs are overrepresented in the IgA+ fraction, and 89 are 
over 
represented in the IgA− fraction. Twenty-four of the 30 IgA+ 
CAGs are considered MGS according to their gene size (fig. S5 and 
data file S3).
Wilcoxon tests were used to compute the probabilities that CAG 
frequency profiles did not differ between the two compared groups 
(SIgAd/HDs and IgA−/IgA+ fractions) by chance alone. Benjamini and 
Hochberg multiple-test correction was applied to the P values. The CAG 
taxonomical annotation was performed as previously described (58).
Dependency associations
Dependency associations between CAGs were defined as described 
previously (32). This analysis relies on the detection of CAGs that 
are systematically associated with other CAGs in n = 396 HDs. Briefly, 
dependencies between CAGs were based on their sample-wise over-
lapping detection. First, a Fisher exact test was used to identify statis-
tically significant CAGs detection overlap. Second, the dependencies 
were validated only when the dependent CAGs were systematically ob-
served with their associated host CAG. Thus, a dependent CAG, called 
satellite CAG, should never occur independently of the host CAG. 
Using these criteria, 886 dependencies were identified, most of which 
involved a small CAG as a satellite, corresponding to phage/bacteria 
or pan-genome/core-genome relationship. Moreover, 45 MGS- 
MGS 
dependency associations were detected, involving MGS as satellite 
and host microorganisms that may reflect bacterial symbiosis events. 
We have considered the 45 MGS-MGS dependency associations de-
tected by Nielsen et al. (32) as a minimal obligatory network that should 
be retrieved in HDs, and we hypothesized that it could be disturbed in 
IgA deficiency. The presence of the 45 links was subsequently inves-
tigated in our cohort, and for each link, we have determined the fre-
quency of its presence in both groups. On the basis of our HD frequency 
distributions, we have determined the 99% confidence interval accord-
ing to the  distribution law defining a threshold of frequency of 84%, 
below which the link was considered significantly decreased at the pop-
ulation level. The investigation of the 45-link presence- 
absence pro-
files in our cohort allowed us to distinguish four possible situations. 
For each link and each individual, if the MGS satellite is present in 
the absence of the host MGS, we consider the link as lost. If the MGS 
satellite is present in the presence of the host MGS, then we consider 
the link as confirmed. If the MGS host is present in the absence of the 
satellite MGS or if the two are absent, then the situation is not taken 
into account (no information about the link).
Statistical analysis
Log2 ratio of IgM+/IgM− bacterial abundances was performed at the lowest 
taxonomic identification level (genus or family) to analyze IgM+ relative 
binding. Only dominant taxa were taken into account, that is, taxa that 
are present in at least 50% of the patients. Zero was normalized in pairs 
and adjusted to the lowest abundance of all taxa in the paired samples.
Flow cytometry analysis was performed using FlowJo (9.3.2) 
TreeStar software and datamined with Funky Cells ToolBox software 
(version 0.1.2; www.FunkyCells.com). Statistical nonparametric tests 
were used whenever necessary: Mann-Whitney was used when com-
paring two groups, Kruskal-Wallis with multiple comparisons post-
test of Dunn’s was used when comparing three groups or more, 
Fisher’s exact test was used for contingency, Wilcoxon paired rank 
test was used for paired analysis, and Spearman coefficient was used 
for correlations. R v3.2.1 and GraphPad Prism version 6 were used 
to perform statistical analysis.

Fondation pour l’Aide a la Recherche sur la Sclerose En Plaques, and Université Pierre et Marie 
Curie Emergence (MycELIA). LPS measurements were supported by a French government 
grant managed by the French National Research Agency under the program “Investissements 
d’Avenir” with reference ANR-11 LABX-0021. Author contributions: J.F., M. Malphettes, L.G., 
D.B., A.M., M. Miyara, E.O., Z.A., and C.F. recruited the patients and collected the clinical data. 
J.F., D.S., D.G., C.J., and M.L. prepared the biospecimens (aliquoting and purification of live 
stool commensals) and cryopreserved them to generate biobank. J.F., D.S., C.P., C.J., and M.L. 
enriched the Ig-bound commensals. F.L., S.K., N.G., and N.P. generated the whole-genome 
metagenomic data. G.A., M.L., and P.L. generated the 16S data. J.F., C.P., D.G., D.S., and M.L. 
performed the flow cytometry analysis of patient lymphocytes and commensals. J.F., D.S., and 
K.D. measured the cytokine and sCD14 levels in donor serum. J.-P.P.d.B. measured the LPS 
levels in donor serum. J.F, H.E.K., M.A., E.L.C., and M.L. performed the data mining and 
biostatistical analysis. J.F., H.E.K., M.L., and G.G. designed the study, prepared the figures, and
