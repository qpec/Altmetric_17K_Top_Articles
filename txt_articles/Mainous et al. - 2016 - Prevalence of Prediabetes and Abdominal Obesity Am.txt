Prevalence of Prediabetes and Abdominal Obesity 
Among Healthy-Weight Adults: 18-Year Trend
ABSTRACT
PURPOSE Trends in sedentary lifestyle may have influenced adult body composi-
tion and metabolic health among individuals at presumably healthy weights. 
This study examines the nationally representative prevalence of prediabetes and 
abdominal obesity among healthy-weight adults in 1988 through 2012.
METHODS We analyzed the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 
(NHANES) III (1988-1994) and NHANES for the years 1999 to 2012, focusing on 
adults aged 20 years and older who have a body mass index (BMI) of 18.5 to 
24.99 and do not have diabetes, either diagnosed or undiagnosed. We defined 
prediabetes using glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) level ranges from 5.7% to 6.4%, 
as specified by the American Diabetes Association. Abdominal obesity was mea-
sured by waist circumference and waist-to-height ratio.
RESULTS The prevalence of prediabetes among healthy-weight adults, aged 20 
years and older and without diagnosed or undiagnosed diabetes, increased from 
10.2% in 1988-1994 to 18.5% in 2012. Among individuals aged 45 years and 
older, the prevalence of prediabetes increased from 22.0% to 33.1%. The per-
centage of adults aged 20 years and older with an unhealthy waist circumference 
increased from 5.6% in 1988-1994 to 7.6% in 2012. The percentage of individu-
als with an unhealthy waist-to-height ratio increased from 27.2% in 1988-1994 to 
33.7% in 2012. Adjusted models found that measures of abdominal obesity were 
not independent predictors of prediabetes among adults with a healthy BMI.
CONCLUSIONS Among individuals within a healthy BMI range, the prevalence of 
prediabetes and abdominal obesity has substantially increased. Abdominal obe-
sity does not appear to be the primary cause of the increase.

INTRODUCTION
P
rediabetes is a high-risk state for the development of diabetes and its 
associated complications.1-3 Recent data have shown that in devel-
oped countries, such as the Unites States and the United Kingdom, 
more than one-third of adults have prediabetes, but most of these indi-
viduals are unaware they have the condition.4-6 Once detected, prediabe-
tes needs to be acknowledged with a treatment plan to prevent or slow 
the transition to diabetes.7,8 Treatment of prediabetes is associated with 
delay of the onset of diabetes.9 Detection and treatment of prediabetes is 
therefore a fundamental strategy in diabetes prevention.1 Moreover, pre-
diabetes-aware adults are more likely than those with prediabetes who are 
unaware of their condition to engage in diabetes risk-reducing behaviors.10
Historical trends in the United States have indicated a substantial rise 
in sedentary lifestyle among adults in recent years.11 Comparing findings 
from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 
1988-1994 with NHANES 2009-2010, the proportion of adults who 
reported no leisure-time physical activity increased from 19.1% to 51.7%. 
Although these leisure-time activity findings have been criticized as a 
result of methodological changes in the NHANES, findings from other 
national surveys have shown decreasing trends in leisure-time physi-

cal activity from the 1990s into the 2000s.12,13 As 
trends in sedentary lifestyle increased, so did trends 
in the prevalence of obesity.11 In addition to the rise 
in obesity, this population-level increase in sedentary 
lifestyle may have influenced adult body composition 
and metabolic health among individuals at presumably 
healthy weights.
Current recommendations for prediabetes screen-
ing by the American Diabetes Association focus nearly 
exclusively on adults who are overweight or obese as 
defined by body mass index (BMI; kg/m2) until the 
patient meets the age-oriented screening at 45 years.1 
Further, the recently released recommendation from the 
US Preventive Services Task Force regarding screening 
for abnormal glucose levels and type 2 diabetes limits 
screening to individuals who are overweight or obese.14 
This focus on obese or overweight individuals, how-
ever, may lead to missed opportunities for investigation 
of undetected disease in healthy-weight individuals.
Although obesity and prediabetes have shown 
trends of increasing prevalence, it is unclear whether 
prediabetes has also increased among healthy-weight 
adults. Moreover, it is unclear whether abdominal obe-
sity has increased among healthy-weight adults. Thus, 
the purpose of this study was to examine the nationally 
representative prevalence of prediabetes and abdomi-
nal obesity among healthy-weight adults reported in 
the 1988-1994 and 1999-2012 NHANES findings.
METHODS
We analyzed the NHANES III and NHANES data for 
the years 1999-2012. NHANES III was conducted in 
1988-1994. The NHANES is a large, nationally rep-
resentative survey that samples the noninstitutional-
ized population of the United States using a stratified 
multistage probability sample design. The application 
of weights and variables accounting for the complex 
survey design allows the study to provide nationally 
representative population estimates for the United 
States. The current study focused on adults aged 20 
years and older who have a BMI of 18.5 to 24.99, 
the range considered healthy, and who have not had 
diabetes diagnosed or a glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) 
level of 6.5% or greater. This study was approved by 
the Institutional Review Board at the University of 
Florida as exempt.
Previously Diagnosed Diabetes
Individuals were considered to have diabetes if they 
reported ever being told by a health care provider that 
they had diabetes, excluding gestational diabetes. We 
also removed individuals with an HbA1c of 6.5% or 
greater to account for undiagnosed diabetes.
Normoglycemia and Prediabetes
Individuals participating in the NHANES undergo a 
physical examination that includes laboratory analysis 
of blood. We defined normoglycemia as an HbA1c level 
between 4.0% and 5.6% (20-38 mmol/mol). To control 
for any potential effect of low HbA1c levels, we also 
removed individuals with an HbA1c level of less than 
4.0% (20 mmol/mol), a level associated with increased 
all-cause mortality in adults without diabetes.15
We defined prediabetes among individuals without 
previously diagnosed or undiagnosed diabetes using 
HbA1c level ranges as specified by the American Dia-
betes Association, 5.7% to 6.4% (39-46 mmol/mol).1 
This range has been shown in a meta-analysis to be 
predictive of progression to diabetes.16 We excluded 
individuals with previously diagnosed diabetes because 
the current glycemic status of those patients may sim-
ply represent diabetes control.
Abdominal Obesity
Abdominal obesity was measured by waist circumfer-
ence and waist-to-height ratio. Waist circumference 
measured a horizontal line just above the uppermost 
lateral border of the right ilium for participants 
at standing position by using measuring tape. An 
unhealthy waist circumference was defined as a waist 
circumference of greater than 102 cm for men and 
greater than 88 cm for women. These measures are 
consistent with the levels for characterizing metabolic 
syndrome. An unhealthy waist-to-height ratio was 
defined as .53 or greater in men and .49 and greater in 
women, levels that are indicative of increased cardio-
metabolic health risk.17-19
First-Degree Relative With Diabetes
In NHANES III, respondents were asked whether 
any of their living or deceased blood relatives (includ-
ing grandparents, parents, brothers, and sisters) were 
ever told by a physician that they had diabetes. In 
NHANES 1999-2012, respondents were asked whether 
any close biological or blood relatives (including father, 
mother, sisters, or brothers) were ever told by a health 
professional that they had diabetes.
Demographic Characteristics
Age was self-reported and categorized as 20 to 44 
years, 45 to 64 years, and 65 years and older. Sex was 
self-reported. Race was self-reported and is categorized 
as non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, Mexican 
American, and other. Education was categorized as less 
than high school (<12 years of education), high school 
(12 years of education), and some college/degree (>12 
years of education). Poverty-to-income ratio is based 
on self-report and categorized as less than 1.0 (pov-

erty) and 1.0 or greater (not in poverty).20 Health 
insurance status was self-reported and categorized as 
private, public, and none.
Analysis
The NHANES uses a stratified multistage probability 
design. To account for the complex sample design of 
the NHANES, SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) and 
SUDAAN 11.0.1 (RTI International, Research Triangle 
Park, NC) were used with the appropriate design and 
weighting variables provided by the National Center 
for Health Statistics.
We calculated prediabetes prevalence for 
NHANES III and for each 2-year NHANES cycle 
from 1999 to 2012, as well as for several demographic 
characteristics. We conducted trend analysis of the 
1999-2012 data, using logistic regression to assess the 
impact of time on prediabetes prevalence, changes in 
waist circumference, and changes in waist-to-height 
ratio for all adults, as well as for adults aged 45 years 
and older. Time is modeled as a continuous variable. 
t Tests were used to calculate the mean difference in 
BMI, waist circumference, and waist-to-height ratio 
between individuals with and without prediabetes for 
2011-2012 data. Forced inclusion logistic regressions 
were conducted using 2011-2012 data to assess the 
impact of waist circumference and waist-to-height ratio 
on prediabetes. Both unadjusted models and models 
adjusting for demographic factors and first-degree rela-
tive with diabetes were computed.
RESULTS
Table 1 shows the prevalence of prediabetes for each 
NHANES cycle, as well as the prevalence of predia-
betes for various demographic characteristics. The 
prevalence of prediabetes varied by year, but tended to 
show an increase overall, with the percentage of those

with prediabetes rising from 10.2% in 1988-1994 to a 
high of 18.5% in 2011-2012. Using HbA1c to measure 
prediabetes, the prevalence of prediabetes appears to 
have decreased from 1988-1994 to 1999-2000, but 
then increases with time.
Figure 1 shows the prevalence of prediabetes 
from 1988 to 2012. The prevalence of prediabetes 
among healthy-weight adults aged 20 years and older 
increased from 10.2% in 1988-1994 to 18.5% in 2012. 
Among individuals aged 45 years and older, the preva-
lence of prediabetes increased from 22.0% to 33.1%. 
Trend analysis for 1999-2012 data shows that the 
increase in prediabetes during that time was statisti-
cally significant both for adults aged 20 years and older 
(P <.0001) and for adults aged 45 years and older (P 
<.0001). Figure 2 shows the change in the percentage 
of adults with an unhealthy waist circumference from 
1988 to 2012 for adults aged 20 years and older and 
for adults aged 45 years and older. The percentage of 
adults aged 20 years and older with an unhealthy waist 
circumference increased from 5.6% in 1988-1994 to 
7.6% in 2012. The change in prevalence of unhealthy 
waist circumference from 1999 to 2012 was not statis-
tically significant either for adults aged 20 years and 
older (P = .38) or for adults aged 45 years and older 
(P = .39). Figure 3 shows the change in the percent-
age of adults with an unhealthy waist-to-height ratio 
from 1988 to 2012. The percentage of adults aged 20 
years and older with an unhealthy waist-to-height ratio 
increased from 27.2% in 1988-1994 to 33.7% in 2012. 
The change in prevalence of unhealthy waist-to-height 
ratio was significant for adults aged 20 years and older 
(P = .01), as well as for adults aged 45 years and older 
(P = .007), in the 1999 to 2012 data.
The mean BMI for individuals without prediabetes 
was 22.2, and mean BMI for individuals with prediabe-
tes was 22.6. The difference in means was statistically 
significant (P = .03). The mean waist circumference for 
individuals without prediabetes was 81.3 cm. For indi-
viduals with prediabetes, the mean waist circumference 
was 84.9 cm (P <.0001). Mean waist-to-height ratio for 
individuals without prediabetes was 0.48. The mean 
waist-to-height ratio for individuals with prediabetes 
was 0.51 (P <.0001).
Table 2 shows the unadjusted and adjusted logistic 
regression results for the impact of unhealthy waist 
circumference and unhealthy waist-to-height ratio on 
risk of prediabetes for adults aged 20 years and older 
and for adults aged 45 years and older. In unadjusted 
analyses, only unhealthy waist-to-height ratio was 
predictive of prediabetes. After adjustment for demo-
graphics and having a first-degree relative with diabe-
tes, however, unhealthy waist-to-height ratio did not 
predict prediabetes.
DISCUSSION
To our knowledge, this study is the first that has 
examined the trends in prediabetes prevalence among 
individuals with a BMI in the healthy range. The key 
findings of this study are that among individuals with 
a BMI in the healthy range, the prevalence of predia-
betes and abdominal obesity has increased from 1988-
1994 to 2012.
In addition to the population change in the meta-
bolic marker of HbA1c, one measure of abdominal 
obesity has also increased among individuals of healthy 
BMI. Previous studies found that people with abdomi-
nal obesity are more likely to have diabetes21,22 and 
to be at increased risk for cardiovascular disease.23,24 
Also, as abdominal obesity in midlife may develop an 
elevated risk of diabetes in older age, it is an important 
factor in predicting diabetes.25 It is important to note

that abdominal obesity is just one of several factors 
that are associated with prediabetes. In fact, although 
our findings reported trends of increased waist-to-
height ratio along with increasing prevalence of pre-
diabetes, abdominal obesity was not independently 
associated with prediabetes after accounting for other 
variables in a multivariate model.
The factors driving the increase in prediabetes 
and waist-to-height ratio among adults with a healthy 
BMI is unclear. Recent studies utilizing NHANES data 
showed that whereas overall dietary quality remains 
poor, there have been improvements to the quality of 
diet in America.26-28 The increase in sedentary lifestyle 
could in part be responsible, as there has been a docu-
mented increase in sedentary lifestyle.11,12 Sedentary 
lifestyle has been shown to negatively affect insulin 
sensitivity29 and increase the relative risk of diabetes.30 
Sedentary lifestyle is also associated with increases in 
abdominal obesity.31-33
The increase of prediabetes 
in individuals with a healthy 
BMI is a concern. The recom-
mendations of the US Preventive 
Services Task Force for screen-
ing for abnormal blood glucose 
levels and type 2 diabetes suggest 
screening for abnormal blood 
glucose levels in adults aged 40 to 
70 years who are overweight or 
obese.14 These guidelines, along 
with those from the American 
Diabetes Association, make it 
less likely that individuals with 
a healthy BMI will be screened, 
despite the increasing prevalence 
of prediabetes among this group.
In interpreting the results of 
this study, we need to consider 
several limitations. First, although 
we were able to assess some com-
mon abdominal obesity measures, 
specifically, waist circumference 
and waist-to-height ratio, hip mea-
surement was not included in both 
NHANES. Thus, we were unable 
to assess the changes in a third, 
common measure of abdominal 
obesity, waist-to-hip ratio. 
Second, this study utilizes 
2 iterations of the NHANES 
with different sampling method-
ologies. Data from 1988-1994 
cannot be included in the trend 
analysis along with data from 
1999-2012, which limits our abil-
ity to estimate the significance of 
the changes in prediabetes and 
abdominal obesity prevalence to 
only the 1999-2012 data. Even so, 
we were still able to document 
an increase in prediabetes and 
waist-to-height ratio using only 
that data.

Third, the NHANES is a cross-sectional survey 
that assesses the health status of different individu-
als in every cycle. The data are weighted, however, 
to allow for analysis of the entire population of the 
United States, rather than relying on idiosyncratic 
patient populations. 
Fourth, the data showed a decrease in prediabetes 
prevalence between 1988-1994 and 1999-2000. The 
reason for this decrease is unclear. It is possible that 
clumping data into a 6-year group for the NHANES III 
led to an artifact when compared with clumping data 
into a 2-year group for the NHANES 1999-2000, but 
the reason for the decrease from the NHANES III to 
NHANES 1999-2000 requires additional exploration. 
Fifth, as was noted earlier, 
some authors have criticized 
comparing leisure time physical 
activity assessments between the 
NHANES III and NHANES from 
2007 forward, because leisure 
time physical activity questions 
were not the same in the 2 data 
sets.12 We were concerned about 
artifactual differences between the 
2 periods, so we were unable to 
assess the impact of leisure time 
physical activity on prediabetes. 
Sixth, although abdominal 
obesity can differ significantly 
among different ethnic groups, in 
particular South and East Asians 
that tend to show a lower BMI 
and higher waist circumference 
than North Americans, NHANES 
is limited in how it distinguishes 
certain ethnic groups. 
Seventh, this report uses only 
HbA1c to measure prediabetes 
prevalence. Although there is evidence that the use of 
HbA1c to identify patients with prediabetes may lead to 
underdiagnosis of patients with prediabetes,34-36 HbA1c 
is the only measure of glucose metabolism available 
for all participants in the NHANES. Fasting plasma 
glucose and oral glucose tolerance testing are available 
only for subsets of respondents. Finally, we are unable 
to account for the apparent decrease in prediabetes 
that occurred from 1999 to 2006.
This nationally representative study provides evi-
dence of a substantial proportion of individuals with a 
healthy weight BMI having prediabetes. Moreover, it 
indicates a secular increase in prediabetes in the popula-
tion designated as a healthy weight. Diabetes prevention 
efforts will benefit from future research focused 
on determining the primary cause of this rise 
and efficient ways to detect prediabetes in pri-
mary care among healthy weight adults.
