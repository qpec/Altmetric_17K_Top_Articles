Robust innate immune detection of rapidly evolving pathogens is critical for host defense.
Nucleotide-binding domain leucine-rich repeat (NLR) proteins function as cytosolic innate
immune sensors in plants and animals. However, the structural basis for ligand-induced NLR
activation has so far remained unknown. NAIP5 (NLR family, apoptosis inhibitory protein 5)
binds the bacterial protein flagellin and assembles with NLRC4 to form a multiprotein complex
called an inflammasome. Here we report the cryo–electron microscopy structure of the
assembled ~1.4-megadalton flagellin-NAIP5-NLRC4 inflammasome, revealing how a ligand
activates an NLR. Six distinct NAIP5 domains contact multiple conserved regions of
flagellin, prying NAIP5 into an open and active conformation. We show that innate immune
recognition of multiple ligand surfaces is a generalizable strategy that limits pathogen
evolution and immune escape.
T
he innate immune system deploys germline-
encoded receptors to detect conserved
pathogen-encoded molecules (1, 2). How-
ever, large population sizes and short gen-
eration times provide pathogens with the
capacity for rapid evolution to evade immune
detection. It is unclear how, over evolutionary
time, innate immune receptors maintain the rec-
ognition of pathogen ligands, especially rela-
tively mutable ligands such as proteins. Members
of the nucleotide-binding domain leucine-rich
repeat (NLR) superfamily function as cytosolic
pathogen sensors in plants and animals (3). One
of the best-characterized NLRs is mouse NAIP5
(NLR family, apoptosis inhibitory protein 5),
which binds to the D0 domain of flagellin, a
protein that forms the bacterial flagellum (4–6).
Family members NAIP1 and NAIP2 detect the
needle and inner rod proteins, respectively, of bac-
terial type III secretion systems (T3SSs) (4, 6–8).
Upon binding their cognate bacterial ligands,
NAIPs co-oligomerize with NLRC4 [NLR family,
CARD (caspase activation and recruitment do-
main)–containing 4] to form a high-molecular-
weight complex (4, 9, 10) called an inflammasome,
which recruits and activates the caspase-1 prote-
ase. Active caspase-1 initiates immune responses
by cleaving and activating interleukins IL-1b and
IL-18 and by triggering a lytic form of cell death
called pyroptosis (11).
The mechanism by which NAIPs bind micro-
bial ligands to nucleate inflammasome formation
has so far been unknown. No NAIP structure has
been reported, and prior cryo–electron micros-
copy (cryo-EM) studies of the NAIP2-NLRC4 in-
flammasome applied symmetry that assumed
the NAIP and NLRC4 protomers to be identical
and thus failed to reveal the structure of the
NAIP or its bound ligand (9, 10, 12). Here we re-
port the structure of the flagellin-NAIP5-NLRC4
inflammasome complex, determined without ap-
plying symmetry, which reveals the mechanism
by which NAIP5 detects flagellin and oligomerizes
with NLRC4.
Overall structure of the
NAIP5 inflammasome
As with all mammalian NLRs, NAIP5 and NLRC4
both contain a conserved nucleotide-binding do-
main (NBD), helical domain 1 (HD1), winged
helix domain (WHD), helical domain 2 (HD2),
and leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain (Fig. 1A).
In addition, NLRC4 contains a CARD, which
recruits caspase-1, whereas NAIP5 contains
three baculovirus inhibitor-of-apoptosis repeat
(BIR) domains of unknown function. We used
cryo-EM to determine the structure of the as-
sembled NAIP5-NLRC4 inflammasome bound
to Legionella pneumophila flagellin (FlaA) (Fig. 1B
and figs. S1 to S3). Our three-dimensional (3D)
reconstructions reveal assemblies that contain a
single NAIP5 subunit (Fig. 1B, blue), easily iden-
tified by its bulky BIR domains (Fig. 1B, arrow-
head), bound to a single FlaA monomer (Fig. 1C,
purple). These results are consistent with prior
evidence that the oligomer is nucleated by a sin-
gle NAIP (9, 10, 13), which then associates with a
variable number of NLRC4 subunits (fig. S2D).
We carried out focused refinement on a region
of the inflammasome containing the single NAIP5
and two of the adjacent NLRC4 subunits (Fig. 1,
C and D; fig. S2; and methods), yielding a re-
construction with an overall resolution of 5.2 Å
(fig. S4). Modeling and advanced fitting tech-
niques (14–17) (methods) enabled the character-
ization of NAIP5 and its binding interfaces with
NLRC4 and flagellin (Figs. 1 and 2 and fig. S5A).
NAIP5 contacts NLRC4 with an oligomerization
“donor” surface, contributed by the WHD and
NBD, which is composed primarily of basic and
hydrophobic residues (Fig. 1E and fig. S5A), as
previously predicted (9, 10). The cognate “accep-
tor” surface of NLRC4 consists of complemen-
tary acidic and hydrophobic residues. We found
that multiple residues in the NLRC4 acceptor
surface are required for NLRC4 to bind to NAIP5
(fig. S5B). Several of these residues, particularly
I124 and D125, are also required for NLRC4 to
bind a neighboring NLRC4 (9). The conforma-
tions of the two adjacent NLRC4 molecules are
identical, even though symmetry was not im-
posed. Thus, the acceptor surface of NLRC4 is
the same regardless of whether it contacts a
NAIP5 or NLRC4 donor surface. In contrast to
prior averaged reconstructions of the NAIP-
NLRC4 inflammasome and the structures of re-
lated complexes such as apoptosomes (18), we
did not observe a substantial number of rings
that appear to be closed (Fig. 1B and fig. S2). The
lack of ring closure is consistent with the prior
proposal that although the donor surface on
NAIP5 can recruit and activate the cognate ac-
ceptor surface on NLRC4, the donor surface on
NLRC4 can only interact with additional NLRC4
protomers and cannot close the ring by interact-
ing with an acceptor surface of NAIP5 (9, 10).
Although the structural homology between
NAIP5 and NLRC4 is high in the regions that
mediate oligomerization (Fig. 1E), some regions
of NAIP5 and NLRC4 are relatively divergent,
particularly the HD2 and LRR (Fig. 1F). Conse-
quently, our model of NLRC4 differs slightly from
previous structures that averaged the NAIP with
NLRC4 (9, 10), particularly in the phosphoryl-
ation loop (19, 20), which is replaced with two
helices in NAIP5 (Fig. 1F, HD2 insert), in addi-
tion to other smaller deviations (fig. S6).
Flagellin recognition by NAIP5
The single FlaA protomer in the complex is rec-
ognized solely by NAIP5, with no apparent con-
tribution to binding by NLRC4 (Fig. 1, C and D).
NAIP5 makes numerous contacts with both
helices of the FlaA D0 domain (Fig. 2A). The N-
terminal D0 helix (D0N; residues 1 to 33) makes
fewer contacts with NAIP5 than the C-terminal

 D0 helix (D0C; residues 441 to 475), which is
contacted along its length, as well as at three
C-terminal leucines (L470, L472, and L473) pre-
viously shown to be important for flagellin rec-
ognition (5). Consistent with these contacts, both
the D0N and D0C helices are capable of binding
to NAIP5 when expressed as separate polypep-
tides fused to green fluorescent protein (GFP),
although association of D0N with NAIP5 requires
the binding of D0C (Fig. 2B). Control experiments
confirmed that the D0N and D0C helices do not
bind to each other in the absence of NAIP5 (fig.
S7B), suggesting an important role for D0N-NAIP5
contacts in flagellin binding (13).
Many of the NAIP5 regions contacting FlaA
are divergent from the corresponding areas of
NLRC4. For example, one of the inserted helices
in HD2 (residues H835 to L850) makes numer-
ous, primarily hydrophobic, contacts with the D0C
helix (Fig. 2C). Similarly, NAIP5 contains a large
insertion in the N-terminal region of the LRRs,
which we term the inserted domain (ID; residues
922 to 983) (Fig. 1, A and F). Although the ID is
not fully resolved in our cryo-EM density, a helix
in this domain (residues 964 to 976) appears to
contact both helices of the FlaA D0 domain (Fig.
2C). One helix of HD1 also appears to bind D0C
(Fig. 2D). These three flagellin-binding regions
are poorly conserved between NAIP2 and NAIP5
(fig. S8), consistent with prior data suggesting
that these regions confer ligand specificity to
NAIPs (21).
Our structure unexpectedly reveals at least
three additional regions of NAIP5 that contact
FlaA (Fig. 2, D and E): (i) BIR1 (residues N107
and S108) appears to directly contact the D0C
helix of FlaA, which would be the first known
specific function attributable to the NAIP BIR
domains; (ii) a helix, just N-terminal to BIR1,
contains residues (Q33 and V34) that appear to
contact one or both D0 helices of FlaA; and (iii) a
small portion of the LRR domain contains res-
idues (R1330, H1360, and S1363) that appear to
contact the D0C helix. To validate all the observed
FlaA-NAIP5 interactions, we assessed the effect
of NAIP5 mutations on binding to either the D0N
or D0C FlaA helices (expressed as separate poly-
peptides fused to GFP) or to full-length FlaA (Fig.
2F). We found that point mutations in the N-
terminal helix, BIR1, HD1, HD2, ID, and LRR each
affected, to varying degrees, the ability of NAIP5
to bind flagellin (Fig. 2F). Taken together, our
results suggest that the binding pocket for fla-
gellin is formed from these six NAIP5 domains
(Fig. 2).
Mechanism of inflammasome assembly
Activation of NLRC4 results from a rigid-body
rotation hinged between the HD1 and WHD
(9, 10, 19). This conformational change unfurls
NLRC4 and positions its donor surface to recruit
and activate the next incoming NLRC4 (Fig. 3A).
On the basis of the high degree of homology be-
tween NAIP5 and NLRC4 in the NBD, HD1, and
WHD domains (Fig. 1E), we propose that NAIP5
also undergoes a rigid-body rotation hinged
around the WHD upon binding flagellin (Fig. 3B).
If we make the parsimonious assumption that
the inactive form of NAIP5 is similar to that of
NLRC4 (Fig. 3, A and B), then crucial parts of
the flagellin-binding surface, particularly those
in HD2, would be sterically occluded by the NBD
and LRR (Fig. 3B). Flagellin binding would nec-
essarily displace the occluding LRR and HD2 from
the NBD, freeing the latter to serve as a donor
surface for NLRC4 to initiate inflammasome as-
sembly (Fig. 3C).
NAIPs recognize multiple
ligand surfaces
To identify regions of flagellin recognized by
NAIP5, we performed an unbiased alanine scan-
ning mutagenesis of the FlaA D0 domain in three

 amino acid blocks. We assayed NAIP5 recognition
of FlaA mutants using a retroviral lethality assay
(5) in which FlaA is expressed in bone marrow–
derivedmacrophages (BMMs) with a GFP-marked
retrovirus. Wild-type FlaA robustly induces pyro-
ptosis, preventing the recovery of GFP+ B6 BMMs,
whereas GFP+ Nlrc4–/– BMMs fail to undergo pyro-
ptosis and are readily detected (Fig. 4A). Naip5–/–
BMMs produce an intermediate number of GFP+
cells, owing to partially redundant flagellin rec-
ognition by NAIP6 (22). Mutation of the C termi-
nus of FlaA, including an L470A/L472A/L473A
mutant previously reported to evade NAIP5 rec-
ognition (5), abrogated the activation of both
NAIP5 and NAIP6 and permitted recovery of
GFP+ transductants. In addition, motifs at res-
idues 458 to 460 and 31 to 33 were partially
required for NAIP5 and NAIP6 activation. The
inability of FlaA mutants to activate NAIP5 and
NAIP6 was not due to their lack of expression
(Fig. 4B). The motifs at residues 458 to 460 and
470 to 473 are supported by our EM structure
and make contacts with the NAIP5 N terminus,
BIR1, and HD1 domains and the HD2 and ID,
respectively, whereas the motif at residues 31 to
33 appears to be proximal to unmodeled regions
of NAIP5.
We also performed alanine scanning mutagen-
esis of PrgJ, the Salmonella typhimurium SPI1
T3SS inner rod protein that is recognized by
NAIP2. Analogous to flagellin, mutations at the
C terminus of PrgJ abolished NAIP2 recognition
(Fig. 4C). In addition, an RLS motif at residues
32 to 34 was also required for NAIP2 activation
but not for PrgJ expression (Fig. 4, C and D). This
motif is particularly striking because of its posi-
tional correspondence to the RLL motif at residues
31 to 33 of FlaA. Lastly, the PrgJ region spanning
residues 65 to 88 (with residues 82 to 85 posi-
tionally corresponding to the motif at residues
458 to 460 in FlaA) consistently contributed weak-
ly to NAIP2 recognition. The motifs identified in
PrgJ and FlaA are important for binding to their
cognate NAIPs (fig. S9) and are well conserved (fig.
S10). Mutation of these motifs in S. typhimurium
flagellin abrogated its recognition by NAIP5 (fig.
S11). Despite recognizing similar motifs in their
respective ligands, NAIP5 and NAIP6 do not bind
to either half of PrgJ, and NAIP2 does not bind to
FlaA D0N or D0C (fig. S12). Thus, it is likely that
the specificity of NAIPs for their cognate ligands
is contributed by variable regions outside the mo-
tifs, consistent with the additional FlaA contacts
that we observe with NAIP5 (Fig. 2). Collectively,
these results indicate that NAIPs recognize mul-
tiple discrete surfaces on their cognate ligands.
Multisurface recognition limits
pathogen immune evasion
The D0 domain of the flagellin monomer is largely
disordered (23, 24) but becomes ordered to form
the core of the polymerized flagellum (25, 26).
Notably, when bound to NAIP5, the flagellin D0
domain adopts a conformation that is nearly
identical to its structure in the flagellar filament
(fig. S13A). Furthermore, NAIP5 contacts similar
residues to those buried in the flagellar filament
(fig. S13, B and C). Thus, we hypothesized that
mutations in FlaA that disrupt its interaction
with NAIP5 might also disrupt flagellar filament
formation. Because multiple flagellin surfaces are
recognized by NAIP5, we further hypothesized
that escape from NAIP5 recognition may require
multiple mutations that would be more likely to
disrupt flagellar function. Indeed, mutation of
any single FlaA residue had little to no effect on
NAIP5-mediated induction of pyroptosis, as mea-
sured by the retroviral lethality assay (fig. S14).
However, simultaneous mutation of the N- and
C-terminal recognition motifs reduced or abol-
ished NAIP5 recognition. To confirm these re-
sults, we mutated the endogenously expressed
L. pneumophila flaA gene and assayed NAIP5
and NLRC4 activation during bacterial infection
of macrophages. We observed that even under

 these stringent conditions, single alanine sub-
stitutions in FlaA did not affect the ability of
L. pneumophila to activate Nlrc4-dependent
pyroptosis (Fig. 5A). In contrast, simultaneous
mutation of the N- and C-terminal motifs affected
NLRC4 activation, particularly the combination
of R31A and L470A. Likewise, the R31A+L470A
double mutant was only weakly restricted for
intracellularreplication, asensitiveassay forNAIP5
function, whereas the single mutants were robustly
restricted (Fig. 5B).
In addition to failing to evade NAIP5 recog-
nition, most single alanine mutations in FlaA did
not affect flagellar assembly or motility. How-
ever, the combined mutations that allowed eva-
sion of NAIP5 recognition also abrogated flagellar
assembly and motility (Fig. 5C). Nonconserva-
tive single mutations (L470P, L470N, L470D, and
L470R) did reduce NAIP5-mediated pyroptosis,
but these mutations also disrupted bacterial mo-
tility (fig. S15). Taken together, these data suggest
that single mutations in flagellin that do not affect
its function are insufficient to escape NAIP5 de-
tection, whereas more severe mutations that do
escape recognition result in a fitness cost to the
bacterium. Thus, we propose that multisurface
recognition imposes a constraint on the muta-
tional paths that pathogens can use to escape im-
mune recognition.
Generalizability of multisurface innate
immune recognition
Analogous to our results with FlaA, single point
mutations in the N- and C-terminal motifs of
PrgJ did not affect its recognition by NAIP2 (fig.
S16, A and B); nor, with one exception (E96A),
did single mutations affect the ability of PrgJ to
assemble a functional T3SS (fig. S16, C and D).
Combined point mutations were sufficient for
PrgJ to evade NAIP2 recognition, but many of
these mutations also disrupted PrgJ function. Un-
like with FlaA, we were able to identify two double
mutants of PrgJ (L33A+V95A and L33A+R100A)
that escape NAIP2 recognition but appear to
retain at least some native function, suggesting
either that the evolutionary constraint of multi-
surface recognition is not always complete or
that our functional assays were not sufficiently
sensitive to detect a modest loss of function.
The strategy of multisurface recognition may
extend to other innate immune receptors that
detect protein ligands (27–29). In particular, the
binding of multiple surfaces has been proposed
to contribute to robust detection of flagellin by
TLR5 (30). We found that simultaneous point
mutation of two motifs in S. typhimurium fla-
gellin (FliC) substantially reduced TLR5 activa-
tion and disrupted bacterial motility, whereas
each single point mutation was largely tolerated
(Fig. 5, D to F). Thus, our data indicate that
multisurface recognition is a general strategy to
limit the evolutionary paths available for patho-
gens to evade innate immune detection.
Conclusion
The combinatorial use of antibiotics and anti-
virals is based on the principle that the simul-
taneous presence of dual selective pressures
provides a greater constraint on the evolution of
escape mutants than does each selective pressure
individually (31). Our results provide structural
and functional evidence that the innate immune
system exploits this general principle and uses a
multisurface recognition strategy to constrain
bacterial immune escape (fig. S17). Although many
pathogens do at least partially evade innate
immunity, our results suggest that evasion of
innate immunity likely involves more complex
mechanisms than simple ligand modifications.
These mechanisms may include the evolution of
compensatory mutations to regain function of
immune-evading mutants (32) or the acquisi-
tion of alternative virulence factors (33), such as
intracellular actin–mediated rather than flagellin-
mediated motility (34). The multisurface recog-
nitionstrategy that we describe likely complements
additional strategies that constrain pathogen evo-
lution. For example, targeting the most conserved
features on microbial ligands helps to constrain
mutagenic escape, although evenconstrainedsites
can tolerate some mutations (Fig. 5C). Pathogen
immune evasion can also be counteracted by di-
versifying selection, observed in both TLR5 (35)

by hosts to counteract the intrinsic advantage
held by large populations of rapidly evolving path-
ogens in their “arms race” with eukaryotic im-
mune systems.
