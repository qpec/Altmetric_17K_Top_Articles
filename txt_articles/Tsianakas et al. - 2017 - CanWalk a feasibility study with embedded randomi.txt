ABSTRACT
Objectives: Walking is an adaptable, inexpensive and
accessible form of physical activity. However, its
impact on quality of life (QoL) and symptom severity in
people with advanced cancer is unknown. This study
aimed to assess the feasibility and acceptability of a
randomised controlled trial (RCT) of a community-
based walking intervention to enhance QoL in people
with recurrent/metastatic cancer.
Design: We used a mixed-methods design comprising
a 2-centre RCT and nested qualitative interviews.
Participants: Patients with advanced breast, prostate,
gynaecological or haematological cancers randomised
1:1 between intervention and usual care.
Intervention: The intervention comprised Macmillan’s
‘Move More’ information, a short motivational interview
with a recommendation to walk for at least 30 min on
alternate days and attend a volunteer-led group walk
weekly.
Outcomes: We assessed feasibility and acceptability
of the intervention and RCT by evaluating study
processes (rates of recruitment, consent, retention,
adherence and adverse events), and using end-of-study
questionnaires and qualitative interviews. Patient-
reported outcome measures (PROMs) assessing QoL,
activity, fatigue, mood and self-efficacy were completed
at baseline and 6, 12 and 24 weeks.
Results: We recruited 42 (38%) eligible participants.
Recruitment was lower than anticipated (goal n=60),
the most commonly reported reason being unable to
commit to walking groups (n=19). Randomisation
procedures worked well with groups evenly matched
for age, sex and activity. By week 24, there was a 45%
attrition rate. Most PROMs while acceptable were not
sensitive to change and did not capture key benefits.
Conclusions: The intervention was acceptable, well
tolerated and the study design was judged acceptable
and feasible. Results are encouraging and demonstrate
that exercise was popular and conveyed benefit to
participants. Consequently, an effectiveness RCT is
warranted, with some modifications to the intervention
to include greater tailoring and more appropriate
PROMs selected.
Trial registration number: ISRCTN42072606.
INTRODUCTION
Life expectancy of people with recurrent or
metastatic
cancer
is
increasing,
but
this
patient
group
is
at
considerable
risk of
experiencing
psychological1
and
physical
health problems.2
3 Despite growing evi-
dence of significant health benefits, physical
activity declines considerably during cancer
treatment
and
remains
low
afterwards.4
Strengths and limitations of this study
▪ The study assessed the feasibility and acceptabi-
lity of a randomised control trial (RCT) of
community-based walking for people with recur-
rent or metastatic breast, gynaecological, haema-
tological or prostate cancers.
▪ The intervention made use of freely available
walking groups and information, combined with
a brief motivational interview and recommenda-
tion to walk for at least 30 min on alternate days
and attend a weekly walking group.
▪ A mixed-methods design, including a two-centre
RCT with nested qualitative interviews, was used
to assess feasibility and acceptability of the inter-
vention and RCT, and test the utility of different
patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs).
▪ The
recruitment
centres
were
London-based
limiting generalisability.
▪ Views of participants from Black and ethnic
minority patients were under-represented as the
majority of participants were Caucasian and
English-speaking.

 There is some evidence that maintaining or increasing
physical activity in patients with cancer can enhance
quality of life (QoL) and well-being as disease pro-
gresses.5 6 However, activity-based interventions are typic-
ally supervised and require attendance at specialist
facilities, potentially limiting acceptability and economic
sustainability.5 7
Brisk walking is an adaptable, inexpensive and effect-
ive physical activity8 9 that has been shown to improve
QoL, physical functioning and fatigue.5
7 It can be
undertaken alone or in groups and is not restricted to
specific facilities or settings—a factor associated with
longer term behaviour change.10 However, it is unclear
whether walking is acceptable to, or improves physical
and psychological well-being of, people with recurrent or
metastatic cancer. We therefore assessed the feasibility
and acceptability of a community-based walking for
people with recurrent or metastatic cancer and rando-
mised controlled trial (RCT). Detailed methods have
been published elsewhere.11 This article reports on:
acceptability and feasibility of the study design and inter-
vention, and provides preliminary evidence of efficacy.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study design and participants
Feasibility of using RCT methodology to test the effect-
iveness of the walking intervention was assessed using a
sequential, explanatory mixed-methods design12 with
nested qualitative interviews. The study was undertaken
between April and November 2014 in two London NHS
Foundation Trusts.
We aimed to recruit at least 60 patients, in order to be
able to estimate the SD of the QoL outcome and estima-
tion of the true treatment difference and perform a
power
calculation
and
sample
size
for
any
future
RCT11 as recommended for feasibility trials.13 14 Eligible
participants were: (1) ≥16 years; (2) diagnosed with
recurrent (advancing) or metastatic breast, colorectal,
upper gastrointestinal, gynaecological, haematological,
head and neck, melanoma or prostate cancer (specific
diagnosis
inclusion/exclusion
criteria
published
elsewhere11).
Recruitment and randomisation
Initially, healthcare professionals (HCP) approached
potential
participants;
however,
because
HCP
were
mostly too busy to identify patients, recruitment was
lower than expected; therefore, research staff were
assigned to recruit. Participants completed postal ques-
tionnaires at baseline (T0), 6 (T1), 12 (T2) and 24 (T3)
weeks following recruitment (see figure 1). Additionally,
those in the intervention group were asked to record
their Walking for Health participation—including date
and location of walks attended—on a simple form.
Consenting participants completed baseline question-
naires before randomisation. They were allocated, via an
online automated system, to either the control (standard
care) or intervention group using minimisation on the
basis of age (≤65, ≥66 years), sex (male, female) and
baseline activity level (<1 hour/week, ≥1 hour/week).
Physical activity intervention
The 12-week CanWalk intervention aimed to motivate
participants to walk for at least 30 min on alternate days.
This target was selected as an acceptable minimum for
those who may be sedentary and/or have reduced phys-
ical functioning. A 15 min motivational telephone (MI)
interview, based on the UK’s National Institute for
Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidance on
promoting physical activity in primary care15 16 was pro-
vided (by authors VT or JH). Participants were addition-
ally provided with printed material promoting activity
(Macmillan
Cancer
Support
(MCS)
‘Move
More’
booklet),17 and encouraged to attend a weekly group
walk of their choice from the Walking for Health (WfH)
programme. WfH is a UK-wide network of free walking
groups
funded
by
Macmillan
Cancer
Support
and
hosted by The Ramblers, suitable for people living with
long-term condition.18 MI is a patient-centred counsel-
ling style that enhances an individual’s motivation to
change.
The
MI
trained
researchers
assessed
the
patient’s readiness to change and motivation to adhere
to the intervention, and used MI techniques to stimu-
late their use of study materials and make progress
towards their own walking goals.19 Researchers encour-
aged participants to plan how they could incorporate
the weekly WfH groups alongside walking independ-
ently or with family/friends. Interviews were audio
recorded with permission and an expert in motivational
interviewing provided supervision to the researchers to
ensure adherence to operational procedures and the
principles of motivational interviewing.11 The control
group was asked to continue with their usual activities.
Primary outcomes: feasibility measures
Data were collected on rates of recruitment, consent,
retention
and
adverse
events.
Reasons
for
non-
participation
and
withdrawal
were
collected,
where
possible. Participants completed an end-of-study ques-
tionnaire (ESQ) assessing acceptability of CanWalk,
randomisation process, study methods and outcome mea-
sures. Adherence to CanWalk was evaluated over 7 days at
each assessment using a self-report measure. We assessed
the feasibility of capturing objective data on walking
behaviour by randomly allocating 50% of the control and
intervention
groups
to
use
a
pedometer
(Omron
HJ-321-E). Participants were asked to wear them for seven
consecutive days at each time-point and complete a usage
log recording their daily step count. Additionally, the
intervention group was asked to keep a log of WfH walks
they undertook. Where possible, reasons for withdrawal
from the study were collected.
Ten participants (5 per group; 6 men and 4 women;
5 >65 years; 9 White British or Irish) took part in
semistructured
telephone
interviews

 acceptability of CanWalk, randomisation process and
outcome measures.
Secondary outcomes: between-group outcomes
Outcome measures for assessing the efficacy of the inter-
vention included QoL (the primary RCT outcome
measure), physical activity, mood, exercise self-efficacy,
fatigue and performance status (the secondary RCT
outcome measures).11
Data analysis
We
examined
differences
between
the
baseline
characteristics of those who completed or withdrew from
the study using χ2 and t-tests, as appropriate. Descriptive
statistics for all between-group outcome measures are
presented, including means (SD), medians (IQR) and
frequencies. Cohen’s d with 95% CIs was calculated for
effect size. The mean (SD) for the main outcome
(QoL) was used to estimate sample size for the effective-
ness trial. All data were analysed using SPSS (V.21) or
SAS (V.9.4).
Audio recordings of qualitative interviews were tran-
scribed verbatim and analysed using the framework
approach.20 Descriptive analysis was undertaken of the
ESQ and free-text comments integrated with the qualita-
tive data. Findings from the qualitative and quantitative
analyses are presented concurrently. The study design is
reviewed using the ADePT framework (a process for
decision-making after pilot and feasibility trials)21 (see
online supplementary appendix 1).

 RESULTS
Feasibility assessment
Recruitment
One hundred and ten people were eligible to partici-
pate; 49 (47%) declined—primarily because of work
commitments. Although willing to walk on alternate
days, they could not commit to a weekly walking group.
While initial interest in participating was relatively high
(53%), the recruitment rate was lower (40%). Reasons
for
this
are
unknown.
In
interviews,
participants
reported the randomisation process was acceptable with
21 allocated to each group. While there was little differ-
ence in most of the demographic and clinical character-
istics between the groups (table 1), almost half of the
sample was educated to at least degree level—higher
than would be expected in the general population.
Retention
Nineteen participants (45%) withdrew from the study:
12 (28%) between T0 and T1; and 7 (17%) between T2
and T3 (figure 1). Although in general reasons for with-
drawal were not provided, two patients were too unwell
and two participants died during the study. The only
factor associated with withdrawal was higher baseline
anxiety (M=6.4, SD=8.1) compared with those who com-
pleted the study (M=4.2, SD=3.8) (t (40)=1.16, p=0.001).
Acceptability of outcome measures
In interviews, participants reported taking 10–40 min to
complete outcome measures. All were judged appropri-
ate except the Scottish Physical Activity Questionnaire
(SPAQ). Eight participants reported it was repetitive and
difficult to complete as illustrated below:
The SPAQ section… a lot of licking my fingers and stick-
ing it in the air, lots of ‘think of a number’ type thing, it
was hard to think. A pre-warning of what was going to be
required might have been helpful so you could fill this
section in accurately. (3013, male, prostate cancer)
These problems were reflected in data quality, with
45% completing the daily activity data incorrectly or not
at all. Further, insufficient numbers of participants
returned the pedometer data at all assessments to
permit analysis.
Assessment of methodological components of the trial
Application of the ADePT framework18 suggests most
components of the trial protocol worked well (see
online supplementary appendix 1). The only exception
was participants were not recruited from three tumour
groups: head and neck, colorectal and skin.
Safety and engagement with the intervention
No adverse outcomes or events were reported. Views
about CanWalk were positive from the ESQ and inter-
views, although interview data suggested engagement
with, and adherence to, WfH group walks varied. Most
(4/5) interviewees from the intervention group partici-
pated in the WfH group walks plus self-initiated walks.
One completed self-initiated walks only.
Hawthorne effect
During interview, only one participant in the control
group reported receiving information about exercise
over the course of the study. Yet on the ESQ, 9 out of 12
said taking part in this study had stimulated them to
undertake more physical activity. Interview findings con-
firmed this effect in three of the five control group
members:
I found it all quite motivating as after filling in the ques-
tionnaire and using the pedometer I found that I was
more focused on walking. I even did a long walk with the
Ramblers which I haven’t done in a while. It prompted
me to be more fit. I sit less on the sofa now and try to get
myself outside. (5020, female, haematological cancer
with pedometer)
Participants’ views on the intervention
At 24 weeks, nine participants completed the ESQ and
results indicated that most (n=8) found it useful and
were satisfied (n=7). Nevertheless, a number of barriers
to the intervention were identified at interview. Some
participants preferred self-initiated walking, and felt
WfH groups, while beneficial for some, did not suit
everybody. Reasons included dislike of group activities
and accessibility issues. One younger participant who
withdrew from the study felt the group walks were more
appropriate for older people and decided to continue
with self-initiated walks only. Consequently, some inter-
viewees suggested modifying the intervention to offer
alternative options to the group walks.
Between-group outcomes
Primary RCT outcome: QoL
While at baseline, the control group reported lower
median
FACT-G
(Functional
Assessment
of
Cancer
Therapy-General) QoL scores than the intervention (53
vs 58, respectively), scores were comparable during
follow-up (table 2). Likewise, the FACT-G subscales
scores at T1–T3 were relatively high and stable for the
intervention and control groups (table 2).
Secondary RCT outcomes
Comparable results for both groups were also found for
the secondary outcomes with median scores remaining
relatively stable across assessments. Detailed descriptive
analysis of subscale scores provide evidence of some
floor or ceiling effects (data not shown). For instance,
the EQ-5D (health status) showed a clear floor effect
with most participants reporting few symptoms at each
time point.
The GPPAQ physical activity index, which includes
activity at work, physical exercise and cycling (but not
walking), indicated the intervention group was more

 active at all assessments than the control, and physical
activity levels for both groups declined over the study
period. However, the GPPAQ item which measures
walking activity indicated that the proportion of partici-
pants doing at least 3 hours of walking a week increased
in both groups (table 3).
In contrast, interview data showed that the interven-
tion group felt that they benefited in terms of physical,
emotional and psychological, social well-being and life-
style changes (see table 4 for illustrative quotes). Most
participants reported being previously active and under-
stood the benefits of being more physically active. On
the ESQ, 7 out of 10 of the intervention group reported
they had set physical activity goals at baseline which they
achieved by 24 weeks. In interviews, all participants in
the intervention group and three out of five in the
control group reported being more active by 24 weeks.
Well-being and lifestyle benefits, such as weight loss,
also motivated participants to increase the amount they
walked. They spoke about how it improved their overall
QoL and helped them maintain a positive attitude
towards
their
illness.
Many
participants
in
the
intervention group spoke of the social benefits of partici-
pating in the WfH groups (table 4 for illustrative quotes).
DISCUSSION
This study aimed to assess the feasibility and acceptabi-
lity of an RCT of a community-based walking programme
in people with recurrent/metastatic cancer. Our results
indicate that most self-initiated walks were acceptable,
though some reported being unable to commit to the
WfH groups regularly, largely due to work commitments.
The CanWalk intervention, based on the UK’s NICE
(National
Institute
for
Healthcare
and
Clinical
Excellence) guidance for promoting physical activity,15 28
includes active components identified as helping indivi-
duals change their behaviour,16 such as goal setting,
planning and social support. However, it is possible that
including more monitoring and tailored feedback could
be beneficial and could be offered remotely through the
use of apps and/or websites. This is supported by com-
ments from participants from the intervention and
support groups, indicating they found that completing

 the outcome measures stimulated them to increase their
physical activity levels.
Key elements of feasibility testing have been identified
by Bowen et al29 and are used (highlighted in bold) here
to evaluate whether the CanWalk intervention warrants
further investigation. A central focus to our study
involved estimating demand for the intervention. Forty
per cent of those eligible to participate in the study con-
sented. This is comparable to recruitment rates reported
in similar studies,30 and not unexpected in a population
comprising people with advanced cancer. Almost a third
withdrew within 6 weeks, which is higher than found in
previous research; however, these studies included those
with early stage cancer31 or had shorter follow-ups
(4 weeks).30 32 Our preliminary evidence indicated an asso-
ciation between withdrawal and higher baseline anxiety.
This warrants further exploration and consideration of
ways the intervention could be made more appealing and
acceptable for people with symptoms of anxiety, perhaps
through a buddy system or by enhancing the motivational
interview component with ‘booster’ follow-up sessions.
This feasibility study also explored the implementation
of the study and intervention. Importantly, based on the
study data, a power calculation was performed for target
recruitment for a future trial. However, the proposed
recruitment estimate was not feasible within the time-
frame; despite extending recruitment and widening the
eligibility criteria to include other diagnoses.
For clinicians to change their practice, they require evi-
dence of the practicality of the interventions, ie, that they
can be delivered within existing means and resources.29
The complementary components of the intervention pro-
moted physical activity. The researchers spent ∼20 min
per person delivering CanWalk. This suggests that if the
intervention proves effective, it could be sufficiently brief
for delivery by HCP in the clinical setting.
Limited-efficacy testing gives an indication of the likely
impact of the intervention, although not the primary
aim of a feasibility study. Results suggest few differences
between groups across the outcome measures at any
time point. Arguably, this inability to detect change
could be attributed to the small sample size, as the pilot

Participants views and experiences of the intervention
Theme
Illustrative comments
Physical benefits
Its praises should be sung more widely, it really would deserve that. It had a revolutionary
effect on me. I’m a walking bore now I’m afraid! It was just the right thing at just the right time
for me. I think more about walking now, I think can I walk there instead of catching the bus. It’s
a fairly painless way of keeping weight down while still eating a little bit of what you enjoy….
(3022 male, prostate cancer no pedometer)
I have walked ever since at least 3 days a week. This study has stimulated me. I drop my
daughter off at school then go with the dog for a long walk. I have noticed the difference
physically. I am back on chemo now and have noticed differences with side effects compared
to last year. Last year I had oedema which I don’t this time and I just feel a lot fitter this time
round. In general, I have a little more stamina than before (5016, male, haematological cancer,
with pedometer)
Emotional/psychological
well-being
I would definitely recommend it, particularly to people who are not actively sporty or for
sedentary people. Being diagnosed with cancer is a pretty devastating thing and being told its
terminal is even more devastating and when I’m on the walks I forget about the cancer, they
have helped me enormously by keeping me physically fit and keeping me well but also
mentally. I bang on a lot less to those around me about dying than I used to. And that’s got to
be good for them as well (3022, male prostate cancer)
Social benefits
I have been doing Nordic walking [WfH] at least once a week—it has made a huge difference
to me physically and mentally. It makes me do more than I would if I was walking on my own,
I have met all sorts of people and as I live on my own it’s great being out and meeting other
people (4065, female gynaecological cancer with pedometer)
Well-being and lifestyle
benefits
The impact has been immense! Gave me the motivation to not only increase walking activity
from minutes to 3–4 hours per week but also to reduce weight to desired 77–80 kg by altering
diet/reducing sweets/sugars. Great boost to morale-no longer dwell on being terminal—just on
getting on with making life as enjoyable as possible, greatly helped by friends made on regular
‘walks for life’ (3022, male, prostate cancer)
Barriers to group walks
There was only one walk I could find locally that lasted more than 30 min and seemed to cover
a reasonable distance. I turned up to meet and they were meeting in the tea room. I know this
sounds a bit ridiculous but I wanted to see who was in the group rather than going straight in. It
seemed that everyone in the group was quite a bit older than me, and they spent the first
20 min of the walking time drinking tea in the cafe. When they moved off they were walking
quite slowly. I’m not criticising the validity of these social group walks but I was looking for
something a bit more energetic, and with people closer in age to me (8003, male, colorectal
cancer)

 study was insufficiently powered to detect subtle differ-
ences. Further, similar to other studies,30 32 33 contamin-
ation may have occurred while assessing activity levels
using outcome measures which reportedly stimulated all
participants to engage in physical activity. Likewise, parti-
cipants highlighted that using pedometers with both
groups had a similar effect. This suggests an alternative
method of assessing walking behaviour is required.
Detailed descriptive evaluation of the performance of
the outcome measures suggests that while being reliable,
some of the measures may not be sensitive to change as
they demonstrated floor/ceiling effects. Moreover, feed-
back from the ESQ and interviews suggested social
support was a key perceived benefit of participating in
the WfH walks, but this was not reflected in the FACT-G
social well-being subscale scores. However, this may be
because it focuses entirely on support from family and
relatives and so would not be sensitive to benefits from
making
wider
social
contacts.
It
will
therefore
be
important to include a brief social support and engage-
ment
measure
(such
as
the
Duke-Social
Support
Questionnaire)34 in future research. Our findings dem-
onstrate the importance of pilot testing questionnaires.
Many
participants
reported
the
SPAQ
was
time-
consuming and confusing suggesting a need to use other
measures of physical activity for both measuring adher-
ence to the intervention and outcomes. Pedometer data
were often not returned, thus alternative methods for
measuring the intensity, duration and frequency of phys-
ical activity in any future study are recommended. While
accelerometers have been used in previous studies, they
often require expert knowledge to interpret and analyse
results, so the use of off-the-shelf wearable technologies
may
offer
an
alternative
and
more
cost-effective
approach.35
Some participants were, from the outset, already active
which
contributed
to
difficulty
in
detecting
between-group changes. Thus, it may be preferable to
only recruit people who are judged to be inactive.
However, this will reduce the number eligible to partici-
pate and exclude people who, although active, wish to
increase the amount they walk.
Based on the study findings, a number of adaptations
are proposed for a future study, including the refine-
ment of the study samples to include different compari-
son
groups,
for
example,
a
tailored
CanWalk
intervention
and
written
information
only
group.
Furthermore,
it
will
be
important
to
ensure
that
outcome measures used match the benefits reported by
participants in the interviews, such as feeling fitter and
having more stamina (eg, functional walking/fitness
tests such as incremental shuttle walk or 6 min walk
test), being less inactive (eg, measure of sedentary
behaviour), weight loss (eg, weight, body mass index,
hip to waist ratio) and symptom control.
Several limitations were identified in the study. The
recruitment centres were London-based, thus limiting
generalisability. Although we were able to collect reasons
for non-participation, unfortunately, we were not able to
collect data on the demographic or clinical character-
istics of those who declined participation. Further, the
qualitative sample was small, limiting the extent of
indepth analysis of participants’ perceptions and experi-
ences. Another limitation is that the views of participants
from Black and minority ethnic groups are under-
represented as the study recruited primarily Caucasian
participants and English speakers.
CONCLUSIONS
This study investigated the feasibility and acceptability of
undertaking an RCT of a community-based walking pro-
gramme to enhance QoL in people with recurrent or
metastatic cancer. Results are encouraging and demon-
strate that exercise was popular and conveyed benefit to
participants. However, further exploration of the inter-
vention is required to refine and understand its compo-
nents and enhance its capacity to create measurable
change.
