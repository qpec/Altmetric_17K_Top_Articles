Complications and Failure to Rescue After Inpatient
Noncardiac Surgery in the Veterans Affairs Health System
Nader N. Massarweh, MD, MPH; Panagiotis Kougias, MD, MSc; Mark A. Wilson, MD, PhD
IMPORTANCE The quality of surgical care in the Veterans Health Administration improved
markedly in the 1990s after implementation of the Veterans Affairs (VA) National Surgical
Quality Improvement Program (now called the VA Surgical Quality Improvement Program).
Although there have been many recent evaluations of surgical care in the private sector, to
date, a contemporary global evaluation has not been performed within the VA health system.
OBJECTIVE To provide a contemporaneous report of noncardiac postoperative outcomes in
the VA health system during the past 15 years.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A retrospective cohort study was conducted using data
from the VA Surgical Quality Improvement Program among veterans who underwent
inpatient general, vascular, thoracic, genitourinary, neurosurgical, orthopedic, or spine
surgery from October 1, 1999, through September 30, 2014.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Rates of 30-day morbidity, mortality, and failure to rescue
(FTR) over time.
RESULTS Among 704 901 patients (mean [SD] age, 63.7 [11.8] years; 676 750 [96%] male)
undergoing noncardiac surgical procedures at 143 hospitals, complications occurred in
97 836 patients (13.9%), major complications occurred in 66 816 (9.5%), FTR occurred in
12 648 of the 97 836 patients with complications (12.9%), FTR after major complications
occurred in 12 223 of the 66 816 patients with major complications (18.3%), and 18 924
patients (2.7%) died within 30 days of surgery. There were significant decreases from 2000
to 2014 in morbidity (8202 of 59 421 [13.8%] vs 3368 of 32 785 [10.3%]), major
complications (5832 of 59 421 [9.8%] vs 2284 of 32 785 [7%]), FTR (1445 of 8202 [17.6%] vs
351 of 3368 [10.4%]), and FTR after major complications (1388 of 5832 [23.8%] vs 343 of
2284 [15%]) (trend test, P < .001 for all). Although there were no clinically meaningful
differences in rates of complications and major complications across hospital risk-adjusted
mortality quintiles (any complications: lowest quintile, 20 945 of 147 721 [14.2%] vs highest
quintile, 18 938 of 135 557 [14%]; major complications: lowest quintile, 14 044 of 147 721
[9.5%] vs highest quintile, 12 881 of 135 557 [9.5%]), FTR rates (any complications: lowest
quintile, 2249 of 20 945 [10.7%] vs highest quintile, 2769 of 18 938 [14.6%]; major
complications: lowest quintile, 2161 of 14 044 [15.4%] vs highest quintile, 2663 of 12 881
[20.7%]) were significantly higher with increasing quintile (P < .001). However, across
hospital quintiles, there were significant decreases in morbidity (20.6%-29.9% decrease;
trend test, P < .001 for all) and FTR (29.2%-50.6% decrease; trend test, P < .001 for all)
during the study period. After hierarchical modeling, the odds of postoperative mortality,
FTR, and FTR after a major complication were approximately 40% to 50% lower in the most
recent study year compared with 15 years ago (P < .001 for all).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE For the past 15 years, morbidity, mortality, and FTR have
improved within the VA health system. Other integrated health systems providing a high
volume of surgical care for their enrollees may benefit by critically evaluating the system-level
approaches of the VA health system to surgical quality improvement.

T
he Veterans Affairs (VA) health system is the largest in-
tegrated health system in the United States, providing
care for approximately 9 million veterans.1 Despite re-
cent adverse attention in the lay press, the VA health system
has been and continues to be a progressive, forward-thinking
health care system and a source of high quality care for its pa-
tients. For example, the VA health system has consistently
made the use of health information technology a national pri-
ority, with an electronic medical record system in place long
before such approaches were brought to the attention of the
broader health care community through the Health Informa-
tion Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act as part
of the 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act.2,3 The
quality of care within the VA health system has consistently
been demonstrated to meet, and in many cases surpass, that
provided in the private sector.4,5
In fiscal year 2015, nearly 400 000 patients underwent an
operation within the VA health system, of which 102 556
(25.8%) were inpatient cases. As far back as the 1980s, the VA
health system has been investing in the development of pro-
cesses to monitor and improve the quality of cardiac and non-
cardiac surgical care provided in its institutions.6 A hallmark
of these efforts is the current VA Surgical Quality Improve-
ment Program (VASQIP). Established in 1991, its precursor (the
National Surgical Quality Improvement Program [NSQIP]) be-
came a national benchmark in terms of surgical quality im-
provement (QI) efforts.7 Renamed VASQIP after merging the
Continuous Improvement in Cardiac Surgery Program and
NSQIP, during the past 2 decades, this nonvoluntary program
has continuously collected standardized, rigorously ob-
tained, clinically rich data from all VA institutions in which ma-
jor surgery is performed and then has conveyed back risk-
adjusted data on postoperative morbidity and mortality. This
approach not only allows each individual institution to com-
pareitselfwithotherVAfacilitiesbutitalsooffersamoreglobal
view of system-wide performance. The program and its suc-
cess were so profound that it was used as a template for a pri-
vate sector version of this QI program championed by the
American College of Surgeons (ACS-NSQIP).8
Significant improvements in the quality of surgical care
within the VA health system were noted in the first decade af-
ter implementation of VASQIP, with a 27% and 45% decrease in
mortalityandmorbidity,respectively.6Recentdatasuggestsig-
nificantimprovementinsurgicalcareintheprivatesectorasso-
ciated with participation in the ACS-NSQIP.9,10 However, there

Methods
Data
Data from VASQIP were used to conduct a retrospective, na-
tional cohort study of patients undergoing inpatient, noncar-
diacsurgeryfromOctober1,1999,throughSeptember30,2014.
Prior descriptions of VASQIP, data collection practices and pro-
tocols, the type of data collected, and the quality and reliabil-
ity of the data have been previously published.6,11,12 This study
was approved by the Baylor College of Medicine institutional
review board, the Michael E. DeBakey Veterans Affairs Medi-
cal Center Research and Development committee, and the Sur-
gical Quality Data Use Group in the Veterans Affairs National
Surgery Office. As VASQIP is an existing data source, patient
consent was waived.
Patients
The VASQIP data set included 850 754 patients who under-
went inpatient, noncardiac surgery. Patients younger than 18
years and those 90 years or older were excluded. A small pro-
portion (751 [0.09%]) of patients was missing data for impor-
tant study variables and/or model covariates and were ex-
cluded. For patients who underwent more than 1 operation
within a 30-day interval, only the first procedure in that pe-
riod was used for analysis. After these exclusions, there were
795 286inpatientsurgicalprocedures.Finally,ouranalysiswas
restricted to patients who underwent general, thoracic, vas-
cular, genitourinary, neurosurgical, orthopedic, or spine op-
erations(704 901[88.6%]ofthe795 286inpatientsurgicalpro-
cedures in the VASQIP cohort). The analysis was restricted to
these specialties because they accounted for 97 836 of 106 895
(91.5%) complications and 18 924 of 20 351 (93%) 30-day mor-
tality events during the study period. The overall VASQIP co-
hort (inclusive of all specialties) was also analyzed in a sensi-
tivity analysis with similar rates and trends noted.
Variables
The VASQIP data set provides demographic patient data as well
as information on clinically relevant preoperative clinical con-
ditions. An established Current Procedural Terminology matrix
was used to identify the surgical specialty for each operation.
Morbidityandmortalitywithin30daysofeachindexoperation
are provided. The abstractors of the VASQIP data set collect in-
formationonthefollowingspecifictypesofcomplications:myo-
cardial infarction, cardiac arrest, cerebrovascular event, coma,

tract infection, superficial surgical site infection, deep wound
infection, fascial dehiscence, pulmonary embolism, deep vein
Key Points
Question Have 30-day postoperative surgical outcomes changed
in the Veterans Affairs health system over time?
Findings In this cohort study of 704 901 patients in the Veterans
Affairs Surgical Quality Improvement Program data set, absolute
rates and the likelihood of complications, mortality, and failure to
rescue have significantly decreased for the past 15 years. These
decreases were observed system-wide at all Veterans Affairs
hospitals, not just those with the best performance.
Meaning Perioperative outcomes in the Veterans Affairs health
system have consistently improved for the past 15 years.

of packed red blood cells, sepsis, and vascular graft failure. We
used a previously established classification scheme to catego-
rizecomplicationsasmajorcomplications(excludingurinarytract
infection,renalinsufficiency,deepveinthrombosis,andsuper-
ficial surgical site infection).13
Statistical Analysis
Patients were the unit of analysis, but outcomes were ascer-
tainedandresultspresentedatthehospitallevel.Themainout-
comes of interest were hospital-level 30-day morbidity (over-
all and major complications), mortality, and failure to rescue
(FTR) (defined as mortality after 1 or more postoperative com-
plications). To delineate whether any observed trends were
system-wide or explained by institution-level variation in out-
comes, hospitals were stratified into quintiles of risk-
adjusted mortality (1, lowest mortality; 5, highest mortality).13
Aspreviouslydescribed,observedhospitalmortalityrateswere
calculated. Expected mortality was then ascertained through
the use of logistic regression adjusted for patient age, sex,
American Society of Anesthesiology classification, emer-
gencyprocedure,congestiveheartfailurewithin30daysofsur-
gery, history of severe chronic obstructive pulmonary dis-
ease, history of neurologic event, the presence of diabetes
requiring oral medications or insulin, dialysis within 2 weeks
of surgery, preoperative functional status, and preoperative
weight loss of more than 10% of body weight within 6 months
of surgery, as well as specialty and complexity of the opera-
tion. Robust standard errors were applied, as was an adjust-
mentforwithin-hospitalclustering.Thisriskadjustmentmodel
had a C statistic of 0.85. Final risk-adjusted mortality was then
calculated using a ratio of observed to expected mortality mul-
tiplied by the overall mortality in the analytic data set (2.7%).
A Cochran-Armitage test for trend was applied to evaluate
changesinratesovertime.Multivariablehierarchicalregression,
including a random effect for the treating hospital, was used to
estimate the odds of each outcome over time with study year
evaluated as the main variable of interest. For the model evalu-
ating30-daymortality,inadditiontothecovariatesnotedinthe
risk-adjustmentmodel,hospitalquintileandthenumberofcom-
plications were also included. To evaluate the odds of FTR over
time, 2 separate models were used. The first evaluated patients
with 1 or more complications of any type. The second was re-
stricted to patients with 1 or more major complications. Sensi-
tivityanalyseswereperformedincludingallVASQIPprocedures

(n = 66 816), respectively. Rates of 30-day mortality, FTR, and
FTR after major complications were 2.7% (n = 18 924), 12.9%
(n = 12 648 of 97 836), and 18.3% (n = 12 223 of 66 816), respec-
tively.Figure1demonstratesratesofcomplications,majorcom-
plications, and associated FTR over time. There were signifi-
cant decreases from 2000 to 2014 in morbidity (8202 of 59 421
[13.8%] vs 3368 of 32 785 [10.3%]; trend test, P < .001), major
complications (5832 of 59 421 [9.8%] vs 2284 of 32 785 [7%];
trend test, P < .001), mortality (2212 of 59 421 [3.7%] vs 555 of
32 785 [1.7%]; trend test, P < .001), FTR (1445 of 8202 [17.6%]
vs 351 of 3368 [10.4%]; trend test, P < .001), and FTR after ma-
jor complications (1388 of 5832 [23.8%] vs 343 of 2284 [15%];
trend test, P < .001).
Across quintiles of hospital risk-adjusted mortality, there
were no clinically meaningful differences in rates of compli-
cations (quintile 1, 20 945 of 147 721 [14.2%]; quintile 2, 19 051
of 143 555 [13.3%]; quintile 3, 18 170 of 133 021 [13.7%]; quin-
tile 4, 20 732 of 145 047 [14.3%]; quintile 5, 18 938 of 135 557
[14%]) and major complications (quintile 1, 14 044 of 147 721
[9.5%]; quintile 2, 13 040 of 143 555 [9.1%]; quintile 3, 12 461
of 133 021 [9.4%]; quintile 4, 14 390 of 145 047 [9.9%]; quin-
tile 5, 12 881 of 135 557 [9.5%]). By comparison, FTR after any
complication (quintile 1, 2249 of 20 945 [10.7%]; quintile 2,
2295 of 19 051 [12.1%]; quintile 3, 2430 of 18 170 [13.4%]; quin-
tile 4, 2905 of 20 732 [14%]; quintile 5, 2769 of 18 938 [14.6%];
trend test, P < .001) and FTR after a major complication (quin-
tile 1, 2161 of 14 044 [15.4%]; quintile 2, 2213 of 13 040 [17%];
quintile 3, 2369 of 12 461 [19%]; quintile 4, 2817 of 14 390
[19.6%]; quintile 5, 2663 of 12 881 [20.7%]; trend test, P < .001)
increased significantly with worsening performance quin-
tile. However, in all performance quintiles, there were signifi-
cant (trend test, P < .001 for all) decreases over time in rates
of complications (20.6%-29.9%), major complications (23.3%-
33%), FTR (29.2%-50.6%), and FTR after major complication
(28.1%-47.5%) (Figure 2).
The odds of postoperative mortality in the VA health sys-
tem decreased significantly over time (Figure 3). Relative to
15 years ago, in the most recent study year, the odds of mor-
tality were 47% lower (odds ratio, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.46-0.60),
with a significant trend favoring improved performance
(P < .001). The odds of mortality associated with FTR also de-
creased over time and to a similar magnitude. For FTR after
any complication, the odds were 41% lower in the most re-
cent study year (odds ratio, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.50-0.69). For FTR
after a major complication, the odds were 39% lower (odds ra-
tio, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.52-0.72). In both cases, there was a signifi-
cant trend for improved performance (P < .001). All findings
were robust in sensitivity analyses.
Discussion
Improving quality, value, and safety in health care are national
priorities. More than 2 decades ago, the VA health system pio-
neered the original version of VASQIP (at that time called VA
NSQIP).7 After implementation of this program, significant im-
provementsinperioperativeoutcomeswerenotedacrosstheVA
health system.6 Following a similar model, the ACS developed
a private sector version that was recently recognized as an im-
portant component of national surgical QI efforts.8,14 However,
itisoftenforgottenthattheoriginalversionofthisprogramwas
pioneered by the VA health system. Although ACS-NSQIP data
have recently been used to describe postoperative outcomes in
theprivatesector,similarcontemporaryevaluationsfromVASQIP
fortheVAhealthsystemarelacking.9,10Inthiscontext,thepur-
poseofthisanalysiswastoprovideaglobalandcontemporane-
ous perspective on the outcomes of surgical care within the VA
healthsystem.Wefoundthat,duringthepast15years,therehave
been decreases of 25.4%, 54.1%, and 40.9% in morbidity, mor-
tality,andFTR,respectively,withanapproximately40%to50%

system-wide and not only at the VA hospitals with the best per-

privatesector.1However,thisisnotthefirsttimethatquestions
abouttherelevanceoftheVAhealthsystemintoday’
shealthcare
landscape have been raised. In the 1990s, the VA health system
facedsignificantcriticismforprovidingpoor-qualitycare,which
led to a reengineering of the health system to address these
concerns.15Thesechangeswereassociatedwithnotableimprove-
mentsand,intheperiodfollowing,thequalityofcarewasfound
to surpass that provided to Medicare fee-for-service beneficia-
ries. Veterans have a higher burden of clinical and sociodemo-
graphiccharacteristicsassociatedwithpooreroutcomes.16-18In
a health care environment that has become increasingly reliant
onqualitymeasuresandcomparativebenchmarking,preventive

calspecialtiesintheVAhealthsystemhavebeencomparablewith

in the private sector.4,5,15,19-21 Regarding veterans’satisfaction
with the care they receive, in a recent patient survey, VA inpa-
tientandoutpatientservicesfaredfavorablyrelativetothosein
the private sector.22
Many factors likely influenced the system-wide improve-
ments in postoperative outcomes observed in our data. The
trends observed in the VA health system generally mirror those
reported in the private sector.9,10 A potential explanation is the
existence of underlying, unmeasured factors associated with
global improvements in surgical management across all health
care settings (private and federal); more simply put, periopera-
tiveandpostoperativecarehasimprovedovertimeandmeasured
outcomes reflect these secular trends. Alternatively, the conti-
nuity of VASQIP as a QI program within the VA health system
could also explain these findings. Two recent studies have
broughtintoquestionthevalueassociatedwithhospitalpartici-
pation in ACS-NSQIP.23,24 However, an issue not addressed in
these analyses is the fact that nonparticipating hospitals could
have been enrolled in any of several existing regional, state,
or internal QI initiatives intended to provide similar data
and services.25 It may be that programs such as VASQIP and
ACS-NSQIP have helped to raise the collective awareness of the
surgical community regarding the importance of such surgical
QIefforts.Althoughdatameasurementalonemaynotbeenough
to drive QI, there may be an element of the Hawthorne effect at
play—recognition that measurement is occurring may be impe-
tus enough to encourage a critical evaluation of an institution’
s
own outcomes. In our current health care environment, which

In addition to VASQIP, VA hospitals also participate in sev-
eral other national quality initiatives, such as the Surgical Care
Improvement Project. Although rates of adherence to Surgical
Care Improvement Project measures within the VA health sys-
tem have improved over time, there has not been a concurrent
decreaseinratesofsurgicalsiteinfections.26Similarfindingsalso
have been noted in the private sector and with respect to other
QIinitiatives.27-29 Datasuchasthesehavecompelledsomecrit-
ics of process-level measures to question their value as poten-
tialqualitymetrics.Althoughtheeffectofanindividualquality
initiative may not be readily apparent when examined in isola-
tion, to our knowledge, there are presently no data describing
what happens when a hospital simultaneously adheres to all
process-level QI measures in aggregate. Given that a variety of
processes are likely to affect a single outcome, in the context of
improved or improving institutional adherence to individual
quality measures, our findings may suggest that the changes in
morbidity, mortality, and FTR over time noted in VASQIP (and
reportedintheprivatesectorfromstudiesusingACS-NSQIPdata)
could be representative of a final common pathway. Put differ-
ently,whilehospitalshaveincreasedadherenceacrossallqual-
ity measures over time, this change may not necessarily mani-

as an improvement in a more composite measure of overall in-

Conclusions
Despite numerous challenges, our data suggest the VA health
system has made notable and continuous gains in the quality
of surgical care provided to its beneficiaries. Given the num-
ber of veterans currently receiving surgical care at VA hospi-
tals, we believe the VA health system continues to be an im-
portant source of health care in the United States and provides
an invaluable service with an often-overlooked societal ben-
efit—onethatmaybedifficulttorecapitulateifveterans’health
carewasshiftedtotheprivatesectoralone.Asaccountablecare
organizationsbecomeamoreintegralpartoftheUShealthcare
landscape, private sector integrated health systems that pro-
vide a high volume of surgical care might benefit from criti-
cally appraising surgical QI approaches adopted in the VA
health system and applying them to the care of their patients.

Invited Commentary
Codman, Hawthorne, and End Results of a Watched System
Jason M. Johanning, MD, MS; Shipra Arya, MD, SM
Ever since Ernest A. Codman first advocated measuring out-
comes of patients through End Results Cards,1 the goal of sur-
gical quality has been to study the results of operative inter-
vention and improve those
results through systematic
analysis. The article by
Massarwehetal2clearlydocu-
ments that the Veterans Administration (VA) Surgical Quality
Improvement Program and, with a nod to Codman, the Ameri-
can College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improve-
ment Program have systemically advanced the quality of care
for millions of surgical patients both in and outside of the VA.
The unique aspect of this article that deserves particular
focus is the trends in failure to rescue (FTR). Failure to rescue
is defined as in-hospital death after a complication and is con-
sidered to be an important indicator of hospital quality. While
postoperative mortality is affected by numerous patient char-
acteristics, FTR is thought to be influenced by structural char-
acteristics and safety culture in hospitals through timely rec-
ognition and treatment of severe complications. Failure to
rescue as a measure is rapidly gaining acceptance as a key met-
ric for assessing surgical quality, with the 2015 adoption by the
Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality as a patient safety
indicator.3 The authors show how mortality and FTR rates af-
ter complications have significantly declined in all hospitals
and differed by hospital performance as stratified by quin-
tiles, with a reduced risk of mortality and FTR of 40% to 50%
(odds ratio, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.46-0.60 and odds ratio, 0.59; 95%
CI, 0.50-0.69; respectively).
The unanswered question the Massarweh et al article2
poses is what ultimately has driven the marked improve-
mentsseenovertime.Themultifactorialnatureofsurgicalcare
precludes an easy answer, and some have questioned whether
participation in a registry is the driving initiative for quality
improvement.4,5Regardlessofthemechanism,onecannotdis-
count the Hawthorne effect6 at the VA, with a congressional
mandate to measure surgical quality and the scrutiny of pub-
lic opinion through the fourth estate. The Massarweh et al
article2 serves notice that the quality and safety of surgical care
in the VA system are on par with if not better than other large
integrated health care systems. The important message from
these studies is that surgery as a community, especially within
the VA, continuously monitors outcomes and continues the
work of improving the end result.
