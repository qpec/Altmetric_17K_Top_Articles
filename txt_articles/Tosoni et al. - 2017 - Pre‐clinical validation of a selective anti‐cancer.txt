Abstract
The cell fate determinant Numb is frequently downregulated in
human breast cancers (BCs), resulting in p53 inactivation and an
aggressive disease course. In the mouse mammary gland, Numb/
p53 downregulation leads to aberrant tissue morphogenesis,
expansion of the stem cell compartment, and emergence of cancer
stem cells (CSCs). Strikingly, CSC phenotypes in a Numb-knockout
mouse model can be reverted by Numb/p53 restoration. Thus,
targeting Numb/p53 dysfunction in Numb-deficient human BCs
could represent a novel anti-CSC therapy. Here, using patient-
derived xenografts, we show that expansion of the CSC pool, due
to altered self-renewing divisions, is also a feature of Numb-
deficient human BCs. In these cancers, using the inhibitor Nutlin-3
to restore p53, we corrected the defective self-renewal properties
of Numb-deficient CSCs and inhibited CSC expansion, with a
marked effect on tumorigenicity and metastasis. Remarkably, a
regimen combining Nutlin-3 and chemotherapy induced persistent
tumor growth inhibition, or even regression, and prevented CSC-
driven tumor relapse after removal of chemotherapy. Our data
provide a pre-clinical proof-of-concept that targeting Numb/p53
results in a specific anti-CSC therapy in human BCs.

Introduction
Cancer stem cells (CSC) have been identified in many types of cancers,
including breast cancer (BC) (Reya et al, 2001; Al-Hajj et al, 2003;
Dick, 2008; Shackleton et al, 2009; Clevers, 2011; Visvader, 2011; Beck
& Blanpain, 2013; Kreso & Dick, 2014). In addition to their role in driv-
ing tumorigenesis, CSCs are thought to impact on therapy failure and
disease progression, based on their intrinsic refractoriness to conven-
tional anti-cancer therapies (Bao et al, 2006; Li et al, 2008; Dean,
2009; Diehn et al, 2009; Oravecz-Wilson et al, 2009; Liu & Wicha,
2010). Thus, the identification of anti-CSC therapies holds great
promise to improve targeted cancer treatment. For such therapies to
be developed, we need knowledge of the molecular mechanisms driv-
ing the emergence and maintenance of CSCs in the various cancer
settings, and adequate pre-clinical models and assays for screening
anti-CSC drugs. In this paper, we address these issues by providing: (i)
evidence of a key molecular mechanism responsible for maintenance
of CSCs in a subset of naturally occurring human BCs, and (ii) proof-
of-concept of an effective anti-CSC therapy through the use of ortho-
topic patient-derived xenografts (PDX) and CSC-specific assays.
Previously, we demonstrated that the cell fate determinant Numb
(Pece et al, 2011) is frequently downregulated in human BCs and
that this event is associated with poor prognosis, suggestive of a
tumor suppressor function of this protein (Pece et al, 2004; Colaluca
et al, 2008). We further demonstrated, in a mouse model, that
Numb exerts a dual homeostatic role in the mammary gland. In the
stem
cell
(SC)
compartment,
Numb
ensures
the
asymmetric
outcome of self-renewing divisions by partitioning, at SC mitosis,
into the progeny that retains the SC identity (Pece et al, 2010;
Tosoni et al, 2015). In progenitors, the re-accumulation of Numb
ensures proper maturation by preventing their reversion to a SC
state (Tosoni et al, 2015). Accordingly, the selective ablation of
Numb in the mouse mammary gland results in gross morphological
alterations and development of pre-neoplastic lesions. These alter-
ations are associated with expansion of the SC compartment and the
emergence of cells displaying CSC traits, that is, a predominantly
symmetric mode of self-renewing division, unlimited proliferation
ability, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and tumori-
genicity upon orthotopic transplantation (Tosoni et al, 2015).

 At the mechanistic level, Numb inhibits the ubiquitination and
ensuing degradation of p53 by the E3 ubiquitin ligase Mdm2
(Colaluca et al, 2008). Ablation of Numb therefore causes abnormal
p53 degradation, which drives EMT and the conversion to the CSC
state (Cicalese et al, 2009; Tosoni et al, 2015). Notably, the CSC
traits acquired by Numb-ablated mouse mammary SCs are reverted
by re-expression of Numb or restoration of p53 through the inhibi-
tion of Mdm2 with the small molecule inhibitor Nutlin-3 (Tosoni
et al, 2015).
Based on these data and the frequent downregulation of Numb
in human BCs, we hypothesized that, in Numb-deficient (Numb�)
human BCs, the Numb/p53 dysfunction is causal in the emergence
of CSCs, and that targeting this pathway will result in selective
suppression of CSCs. Herein, we present the experimental validation
of this hypothesis. To maximize the clinical relevance of our study,
we employed orthotopic PDXs which, due to their ability to recapit-
ulate the response of the parental tumors to treatments, represent
more efficacious pre-clinical tools than the traditional, scarcely
predictive models, such as established cell lines and their xenografts
(DeRose et al, 2011; Gillet et al, 2011; Zhang et al, 2013; Wilding &
Bodmer, 2014; Clohessy & Pandolfi, 2015; Whittle et al, 2015). Our
results show that targeting the Numb/p53 pathway results in a CSC-
specific therapy of Numb� BCs.
Results
Characterization of human tumors and PDX models
To determine whether loss of Numb expression is critical for the
maintenance of the CSC pool, we selected four Numb� human BCs
(T1–T4) displaying the typical clinical–pathological parameters that
characterize this type of aggressive BC (Pece et al, 2004) (Fig 1A).
Importantly, we verified a wild-type (WT) status of the P53 gene in
these tumors, meaning that a fully functional Numb/p53 pathway
could in principle be restored (Fig 1A), and confirmed that loss of
Numb expression was due to its increased proteasomal degradation
(Fig 1B and Appendix Fig S1A), as described previously (Pece et al,
2004; Colaluca et al, 2008). To control that any effects we might
observe were specific to loss of Numb expression and not merely
associated with an aggressive BC phenotype per se, we also selected
four Numb-proficient (Numb+) tumors (TA-TD) with clinical–
pathological parameters similar to those of the Numb� BCs (Fig 1A
and B, and Appendix Fig S1A).
To study the tumorigenic properties of Numb� CSCs, we devel-
oped clinically relevant PDX models, by xenotransplantation of
fresh tumor explants into the inguinal mammary glands of immuno-
compromised mice. We confirmed by immunohistochemistry (IHC)
on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) sections that the
expression levels of Numb in the parental tumors were maintained
in the corresponding PDXs (Fig 1C and Appendix Fig S1B).
Numb-deficient human BCs display expansion of the CSC pool
and altered SC self-renewal in an in vitro setting
In the mouse model, we demonstrated that Numb ablation results in
expansion of the SC compartment (with characteristics of CSCs) due
to an increased frequency of symmetric self-renewing divisions
(Tosoni et al, 2015). To determine whether a similar scenario could
be at play in Numb� human BCs, we performed a series of assays
in vitro, based on the mammosphere (MS) culture technique.
Mammosphere cultures were generated by culturing primary
mammary epithelial cells (MECs), from the described tumors, in
anchorage-independent conditions. Under such conditions, the
majority of MECs undergo anoikis, while SCs survive and generate
clonal spheroids or MSs (Dontu et al, 2004; Pece et al, 2010). We
have previously established that MS cultures can be used, with due
caution, as a proxy to assess the self-renewal properties of
mammary SCs since: (i) the sphere forming efficiency (SFE) is
indicative of the size of the SC pool (SC content); (ii) the serial prop-
agation ability of MS cultures mirrors expansion of the SC pool
(Pece et al, 2010; Tosoni et al, 2015).
We compared MSs generated from Numb� BCs to MSs generated
by normal MECs from the same patients (Fig 1D and E, and
Appendix Fig S1C and D). Numb� BC MSs were bigger and gener-
ated with a higher SFE, than the normal counterparts (Fig 1D and
Appendix Fig S1C), and displayed continuous expansion upon serial
propagation (Fig 1E and Appendix Fig S1D and E), probably as a
consequence of symmetric self-renewal divisions performed by
Numb� MS-forming cells (MFC) (Appendix Fig S2A and B).

 Conversely, normal MSs displayed a progressive decrease in self-
renewing potential (Fig 1E and Appendix Fig S1D) and the MFCs
performed asymmetric self-renewal divisions, as also witnessed by
the asymmetric partitioning of Numb at mitosis of the MFC
(Appendix Fig S2C and D). Thus, the properties of Numb� BC MSs
are consistent with an expanded CSC pool with increased self-
renewal potential.
Finally, we assessed the serial propagation ability of MSs derived
from the four Numb+ human BCs (TA-D) selected as controls. For
these tumors to be suitable controls that would permit us to attri-
bute specific effects to a Numb� status rather than to an aggressive
tumor phenotype, it was necessary that they displayed similar prop-
erties, in the MS assay, to those of Numb� tumors. We verified that
this was indeed the case by analyzing the SFE (Fig 1D) and the
kinetics of MS expansion in the serial propagation assay (Fig 1E and
Appendix Fig S1E and F), which were indeed comparable between
the analyzed Numb� and Numb+ BCs. The observation that
Numb+ human breast CSCs also display increased self-renewal
potential highlights the existence of alternative Numb-independent
mechanisms responsible for SC expansion in high-grade BCs.
Loss of Numb is responsible for expansion of the SC
compartment in Numb� BCs
The above data are consistent with the notion that loss of Numb
expression in Numb� BCs causes expansion of the SC compartment.
To test this possibility, we re-expressed a DsRed-conjugated Numb
protein (Numb-DsRed) in tumor MECs (Fig 2A), and tested its
effects in vitro and in vivo. As expected, re-expression of Numb in
Numb� MECs resulted in increased p53 levels (Fig 2A) and func-
tion, determined by qPCR of p53 target genes (Fig 2B), while p53 in
Numb+ MECs was unaffected (Fig 2A and B).
In an in vitro setting, re-expression of Numb in Numb� MECs
caused: (i) a reduced ability to generate MS, as evidenced by a
reduction in SFE and average MS size (Fig 2C); (ii) a switch in the
mode of the first mitotic division of the MFC (Fig 2D and
Appendix Fig S2B), from symmetric to asymmetric, as assessed by
time-lapse video microscopy; (iii) a marked reduction in the self-
renewal capacity of the SC population in the serial MS propagation
assay (Fig 2E). In contrast, the expression of DsRed-Numb in
Numb+ MECs had no effect on the self-renewal properties of CSCs
(Fig 2C–E).
In the PDX model system, Numb-reconstituted Numb� MECs
generated tumors that were reduced in size by ~40% compared with
mock-infected controls, while Numb overexpression had no effect
on the growth of tumors generated by Numb+ MECs (Fig 3A).
Tumors generated from Numb-reconstituted Numb� MECs showed
no evidence of increased apoptosis or decreased proliferation in the
bulk tumor population (Fig 3B and C), arguing in favor of a selec-
tive effect of Numb restoration on the CSC compartment. To prove
this, we directly measured the number of cancer-initiating cells
(CIC) (functionally equivalent to CSCs) by limiting dilution ortho-
topic transplantation. We observed that Numb restoration in
Numb� MECs resulted in a 70–75% reduction in CICs, but had no
effect on Numb+ MECs (Table 1).
These results argue that, in Numb� tumors, loss of Numb expres-
sion causes the expansion of the SC compartment leading to tumori-
genesis. Although the mechanisms responsible for SC expansion in
Numb+ tumors remain to be established, our data show that these
tumors represent a suitable control for the Numb-dependent pheno-
types observed in Numb� tumors.
Attenuation of p53 activity drives expansion of the SC
compartment in Numb� tumors
We previously demonstrated, in a mouse model, that the asymmet-
ric
partitioning
of
Numb
during
mitotic
division
of
normal
mammary SCs determines asymmetric cell division (Tosoni et al,
2015). The downstream effector in this pathway is p53 (Tosoni
et al, 2015), whose levels are stabilized due to the inhibition of
Mdm2 by Numb (Colaluca et al, 2008).
We reasoned that the subversion of this mechanism might be
responsible, at least in part, for the alterations in the SC compart-
ment in Numb� human BCs. If so, restoration of p53 activity should
attenuate the CSC phenotypes caused by loss of Numb. To restore
p53 activity, we used Nutlin-3, a small molecule inhibitor that
prevents Mdm2-mediated ubiquitination of p53 (Vassilev et al,
2004).

regulated by p53, NANOG, repressed by p53. +Nb, reconstituted with Numb-DsRed; Ctr, mock-infected. Data are from a single experiment.
C
MSs obtained from the indicated BCs were reconstituted with Numb-DsRed (+Nb) or mock-infected (Ctr) and assessed for SFE and MS size. Data are mean values of
three independent experiments (� SD of 12 measurements) and are expressed relative to the SFE or MS size in Ctr cells (= 100%). Unpaired two-sided Student’s
t-test. *P < 0.05 vs. Ctr in the matching condition was considered as significant (P-value SFE: T1, 3.06E-07; T2, 6.93E-07; T3, 1.18E-07; T4, 4.73E-09; P-value MS size:
T1, 0.0093; T2, 8E-19; T3, 2.8E-21; T4, 7.7E-09).
D
MSs treated as in (C) were assessed for SC mode of division. The percentage of asymmetric and symmetric divisions for each condition (Numb� and Numb+ SCs; Ctr
and Numb-dsRed-reconstituted SCs) was calculated by following the pattern of cell number progression within the forming MS (1-2-3-5 progression = asymmetric
division of the SC; 1-2-4-6/8 progression = symmetric division of the SC; see also Appendix Fig S2 for a detailed description of the criteria). For each condition, the
bars represent the mean value, from three independent experiments, of the percentage of asymmetric (Asym.) vs. symmetric divisions (Sym.) performed by the MS-
forming cell (MFC). The SD was calculated from a minimum of 50 MFCs for each condition. Non-parametric Fisher’s exact test. *P < 0.05 vs. Ctr in the matching
condition was considered as significant (P-value T1, 4.03E-07; T2, 8.91E-04).

MSs treated as in (C) were assessed for self-renewal ability in the serial MS propagation assay. Shown data are from experiments representative of three biological
replicas and are expressed as the mean value of technical triplicates. When not indicated, SD was < 30% of the mean. Linear regression analysis followed by unpaired
two-sided Student’s t-test was used to compare the slopes of the regression lines. P < 0.05 vs. Ctr in the matching condition was considered as significant (P-values:
T1, 2.02E-05; T2, 3.45E-05; T3, 9.17E-06; T4, 7.74E-05). See also Appendix Figs S1 and S2 for additional experimental and methodological details.

 Treatment with Nutlin-3 caused an increase in p53 levels in
Numb�, but not in Numb+, MECs (Fig 4A). This was accompanied
by enhanced p53 activity, as witnessed by increased levels of p53
target genes (Fig 4B). At the biological level, Nutlin-3 induced in
Numb�, but not Numb+, MECs: (i) a reduction in SFE and MS size
(Fig 4C); (ii) a reduction in the ability of MSs to be serially propa-
gated (Fig 4D); (iii) a switch in the mode of division from symmetric
to asymmetric (Fig 4E). At the dose employed (10 lM), Nutlin-3 did
not exert significant toxic effects, as assessed by monitoring the levels
of proliferation (Ki67) and apoptosis (activated caspase-3) markers
(Appendix Fig S3A). In addition, the effects of Nutlin-3 were unlikely
due to off-target effects of the drug, since an inactive enantiomer,
Nutlin-3b, was inactive in all experiments at concentrations five
times higher than those used for Nutlin-3 (Appendix Fig S3A and B).
We concluded that attenuation of p53 activity in Numb� BCs is
directly responsible for de-regulation of SC self-renewal and expan-
sion of the SC compartment.
Pharmacological restoration of p53 selectively targets the CSC
population in PDXs
Based on the above results, we hypothesized that pharmacological
targeting of the Numb/p53 axis might represent an effective
anti-CSC therapy in Numb� BCs. To validate this concept in a
pre-clinical setting that closely recapitulates real tumors, we took
advantage of the PDX models.
In initial experiments, we pre-treated Numb� and Numb+ MECs
in vitro with Nutlin-3 and then orthotopically xenografted them.
Treated Numb� (but not Numb+) MECs generated PDXs with a
significantly slower growth rate compared to those derived from
mock-treated cells (Fig 4F). This effect occurred in the absence of
detectable modifications in the rate of proliferation or apoptosis in
the bulk tumor cell population (Fig 4G). Controls performed with
the inactive enantiomer, Nutlin-3b, showed that the effect of Nutlin-
3 was specific (Appendix Fig S3C). Furthermore, in a tail vein

 injection model, in vitro pre-treatment with Nutlin-3 significantly
suppressed the colonization of the lung by Numb� (but not Numb+)
MECs (Fig 5).
We then moved to a more stringent setting, based on the in vivo
Nutlin-3
treatment
of
PDXs
that
had
reached
palpable
size
(~20 mm3). At the end of the in vivo treatment (12 days), no effect
on tumor size was observed (Fig 6A), despite increases in p53 levels
caused by Nutlin-3 (Fig 6B). However, MECs derived from Numb�
(but not Numb+) primary PDXs that had been treated with Nutlin-3
in vivo displayed a significantly reduced MS-SFE in vitro compared
with controls (Fig 6C, left). Moreover, upon re-transplantation,
performed with no further drug treatment, these cells generated
tumors that were significantly smaller than their corresponding
controls (Fig 6C, right), in the absence of any detectable effect on
the rate of proliferation or apoptosis in the bulk tumor mass
(Fig 6D).
The observation that in vivo treatment with Nutlin-3 did not
influence the growth of the primary PDXs (at least in the time-
frame of our experiment), but affected the SFE in vitro and the
growth of second generation PDXs, is consistent with the notion
that Nutlin-3 is a selective anti-CSC therapy in Numb� BCs.
Indeed, one would predict that a therapy selectively targeting
slow-proliferating CSCs, while having no effect on actively divid-
ing progenitors, would have little effect in the short-term on tumor
growth, but instead become effective once the progenitors have
exhausted their replicative ability.
We sought direct proof for this possibility by performing limiting
dilution xenotransplantation experiments. PDXs were grown until
Figure 4.
Effects of Nutlin-3 on the mode of division of Numb� and Numb+ tumors.
A, B
MSs derived from Numb� and Numb+ tumors were treated with 10 lM Nutlin-3 and analyzed by IB (A) or qPCR (B) to evaluate the restoration of p53. In (A),
GRP94, loading control. Panels shown in the IB were assembled either using lanes from the same blot (splicing out lanes loaded with additional controls or non-
relevant samples), or from different blots run and stained simultaneously (see also Materials and Methods). In (B), CDKN1A (p21) and MDM2, positively regulated
p53 target genes. Data are from a single experiment.
C–F
MECs derived from the indicated BCs were treated in vitro with 10 lM Nutlin-3 or vehicle (Ctr) and assessed for SFE and MS size (C), MS serial propagation
ability (D), mode of division (E), and tumorigenicity (F). In (C), data are mean values of three independent experiments (� SD of 12 measurements) and are
expressed relative to the SFE or MS size in Ctr cells (= 100%). Unpaired two-sided Student’s t-test. *P < 0.05 vs. Ctr in the matching condition was considered as
significant (P-value SFE: T1, 5.65E-07; T2, 2.38E-08, P-value MS size: T1, 4.99E-12; T2, 6.88E-14). In (D), data are from experiments representative of three
biological replicas and are expressed as the mean value of technical triplicates. When not indicated, SD was < 30% of the mean. Linear regression analysis
followed by unpaired two-sided Student’s t-test. P < 0.05 vs. Ctr in the matching condition was considered as significant (P-values: T1, 5.03E-06; T2, 1.83E-05). In
(E), the percentage of asymmetric (Asym.) and symmetric (Sym.) divisions for each condition (Numb� and Numb+ SCs; Ctr and Nutlin-treated SCs) was calculated
based on the pattern of asymmetric vs. symmetric division (see also legends to Fig 2D and Appendix Fig S2 for further details). For each condition, the bars
represent the mean value, from three independent experiments, of the percentage of asymmetric (Asym.) vs. symmetric divisions (Sym.) performed by the MS-
forming cell (MFC). The SD was calculated from a minimum of 50 MFCs for each condition. Non-parametric Fisher’s exact test. *P < 0.05 vs. Ctr in the matching
condition was considered as significant (P-value T1, 9.62E-11; T2, 6.60E-03). In (F), Numb� and Numb+ MECs, treated with Nutlin or vehicle (Ctr), were
orthotopically transplanted (50,000 cells per injection) in NGS mice. Animals were sacrificed at 15–21 days post-injection, and tumor volume was assessed by
caliper measurement immediately after excision. Bars represent the tumor volume, expressed as the mean value of three independent experiments (� SD of a
minimum of 11 to a maximum of 16 tumors). Unpaired two-sided Student’s t-test. *P < 0.05 vs. Ctr in the matching condition was considered as significant (T1,
P = 5.09E-18; T2, P = 2E-17).

Numb� or Numb+ MECs, reconstituted with Numb-DsRed (Numb) or mock-infected (Ctr), were orthotopically transplanted at limiting dilutions in NGS mice. The
number of outgrowths per number of injected pads (Outgrowths/injections) is indicated. The complete statistical analysis of the experiment, with the frequency
of CICs and with 95% confidence intervals (CI), is shown. The frequencies were calculated by Poisson statistics, using the “StatMod” software package for the R
computing environment (http://www.R-project.org), as previously described (Shackleton et al, 2006), and a complementary log-log generalized linear model (two-
sided 95% Wald confidence intervals or, in case of zero outgrowths, one-sided 95% Clopper–Pearson intervals). The single-hit assumption was tested as
recommended and was not rejected for any dilution series (P > 0.05).

 palpable (~20 mm3) before commencing with Nutlin-3 treatment.
After 12 days of treatment, PDX-derived cells were orthotopically
re-transplanted, in the absence of any further exposure to the drug,
at limiting dilutions. We observed a pronounced decrease (5–6–fold)
in the frequency of CICs in Nutlin-3-treated Numb� PDXs compared
with controls, while no effect was observed on Numb+ PDXs
(Table 2).
Nutlin-3 potentiates the anti-tumoral effects of
chemotherapy and prevents tumor growth relapse after
chemotherapy discontinuation
Based on the emerging notion that CSCs are able to drive tumor
recurrence after initial transient response to chemotherapy, we
used the PDX models to test the efficacy of Nutlin-3 in combina-
tion with paclitaxel, a standard-of-care chemotherapy drug used
in many types of cancer, including breast cancer (Goldhirsch
et al, 2007). To generate a sufficient number of tumor-bearing
mice to be randomized to treatment with Nutlin-3 and paclitaxel
either alone or in combination (see Materials and Methods), we
selected three additional Numb� PDXs and one Numb+ PDX as a
control (characterized in Appendix Fig S4A and B). MECs from
these PDXs were transplanted into NOD/SCID mice and allowed
to form tumors with a minimal size of ~100–200 mm3 to better
monitor tumor burden variations in response to treatments. In
keeping with our previous observations (see Fig 6A), Nutlin-3
showed no effect on the initial tumor response (Fig 7, left; day
15), regardless of the Numb status. Tumor-bearing mice belong-
ing to the control (vehicle only) and Nutlin-3 groups had to be
invariably removed from the study within 15 days of the start of
the treatment due to excessive tumor growth (Fig 7, left). In
contrast, paclitaxel was highly efficacious in causing initial inhibi-
tion of tumor growth accompanied by anti-proliferative and/or
pro-apoptotic effects (Appendix Fig S4C and D). However, upon
therapy discontinuation all tumors, regardless of the Numb status,
displayed robust re-growth, compatible with the existence of a
paclitaxel-resistant subpopulation (Fig 7, left).
Remarkably, Nutlin-3 increased the response to paclitaxel,
during the treatment period, with a synergistic effect ranging from
an ~30% increase in tumor reduction to complete tumor regression
(Fig 7, left). More importantly, in the Nutlin-3 + paclitaxel group of
Numb� (but not in the Numb+) PDXs, we never observed tumor
re-growth. In this subgroup, by the end of the observation period,
animals showed either a significantly decreased tumor burden
compared to baseline tumors (a measure equivalent to the “objec-
tive response rate, ORR” used in clinical trials), or complete tumor
regression (equivalent to a “pathological complete response, pCR”
in the clinical setting) (T7 Numb� tumor in Fig 7, left).
To evaluate the in vivo effects of the different treatments on the
CSC fraction, MECs were isolated from tumors of each group (at the
end of the treatment period in vivo) and tested, in the absence of any
further treatment, for MS formation efficiency in vitro and tumori-
genicity in vivo, or analyzed by flow cytometry for the expression of
surface markers previously linked to a breast CSC phenotype (Al-
Hajj et al, 2003; Ginestier et al, 2007; Ricardo et al, 2011). Numb�
MECs derived from PDXs treated in vivo with Nutlin-3, either alone
or in combination with paclitaxel, displayed significant reduction in
SFE and tumor formation (Fig 7, middle and right), accompanied by
decreased ALDH activity or reduced number of CD44+/CD24� cells
(Appendix Fig S5). Conversely, no effects were evident in Numb�
MECs obtained from the paclitaxel only group or in MECs from the
Numb+ PDX (Fig 7, middle and right; Appendix Fig S5).

 Discussion
Despite considerable efforts placed in the development of novel
cancer drugs, most treatments fail during clinical trials. This failure
is in part attributable to: (i) the design of pre-clinical validation
studies, mostly based on models (established cell lines and their
xenografts) insufficient to predict accurately patients’ response to
treatment, and (ii) current measures of therapy efficacy based on
short-term tumor debulking, thereby ignoring the contribution of
persistent CSCs to disease progression (Therasse et al, 2000; Liu &
Wicha, 2010). Herein, we provide a pre-clinical validation of a strat-
egy that addresses these two issues by using orthotopic PDXs as a

Effects of in vivo Nutlin-3 treatment on CSC content of Numb� and Numb+ tumors.
A
MSs derived from Numb� and Numb+ tumors were orthotopically transplanted into NGS mice and allowed to form tumors of ~20 mm3 (dashed red line). Nutlin-3
(Nutlin) or vehicle DMSO (Ctr) was then administered to the mice every 3 days at 20 mg/kg for a period of 12 days, at the end of which, mice were sacrificed and
tumor volume was measured. Bars represent the tumor volume, expressed as the mean value of three independent experiments (� SD of a minimum of 11 to a
maximum of 16 tumors). Unpaired two-sided Student’s t-test. *P < 0.05 vs. Ctr in the matching condition was considered as significant. No significant differences
were observed either in Numb� or Numb+ tumors.
B, C
Tumors, obtained in (A) were dissociated and cells were analyzed by IB to verify the efficacy of the in vivo Nutlin-3 treatment (B), and then either tested for MS-
forming efficiency (SFE), (C, left), or re-transplanted orthotopically in mice for 3 weeks (C, right). In (B), panels shown in the IB were assembled either using lanes
from the same blot (splicing out lanes loaded with additional controls or non-relevant samples), or from different blots run and stained simultaneously (see also
Materials and Methods). Tubulin, loading control. In (C), SFE data are mean values of three independent experiments (� SD of 12 measurements) and are expressed
relative to the SFE or MS size in Ctr cells (= 100%). Unpaired two-sided Student’s t-test. *P < 0.05 vs. Ctr in the matching condition was considered as significant
(P-value SFE: T1, 1.01E-10; T2, 8.54E-09; T3, 7.89E-10; T4, 1.16E-09). Right, bars represent the tumor volume, expressed as the mean value of three independent
experiments (� SD of a minimum of 11 to a maximum of 16 tumors). Unpaired two-sided Student’s t-test. *P < 0.05 vs. Ctr in the matching condition was
considered as significant (T1, P = 4.70E-18; T2, P = 9.27E-15; T3, P = 5.57E-09; T4, P = 6.94E-09).

 model system, and by evaluating treatment efficacy based on CSC-
specific parameters.
We demonstrated that re-expression of Numb in Numb� BC
cells: (i) decreases their MS-forming ability; (ii) reverses their unlim-
ited self-renewal potential and restores self-extinguishing kinetics in
the serial MS propagation assay; (iii) decreases their in vivo tumori-
genic potential; (iv) decreases the size of the CSC pool. In addition,
the phenotypes associated with loss of Numb expression were all
reverted by restoration of physiological levels of p53 by Nutlin-3.
This latter finding is particularly pertinent to BC, where p53 is rela-
tively less frequently mutated compared with other types of tumors,
and loss of WT p53 activity may depend on alterations of several
upstream regulatory pathways (Gasco et al, 2002; Dumay et al,
2013). Thus, Numb� tumors behave functionally as p53-null tumors,
offering the possibility of combating Numb dysfunction, and its asso-
ciated cancer phenotypes, downstream at the level of p53.
The deregulation of the Numb/p53 axis is not the sole mecha-
nism through which expansion of the SC compartment and emer-
gence of CSCs can be achieved in BC. Indeed, an amplified SC pool
was also evident in Numb+ tumors. However, these tumors were
insensitive to Numb expression or Nutlin-3 treatment. These data
indicate that loss of Numb is a causal event in the subgroup of
Numb� BCs, and establish Numb as an authentic tumor suppressor
gene in naturally occurring cancers.
The impact of loss of Numb expression on mammary carcinogen-
esis could be even more far reaching, since this event also causes
unchecked Notch activity, which is relevant to the transformed
phenotype of Numb� human tumors (Pece et al, 2004; Colaluca
et al, 2008; Westhoff et al, 2009). Thus, deregulation of Notch activ-
ity might contribute to transformation in Numb� tumors, a notion
supported by evidence implicating Notch in the regulation of
mammary SC self-renewal and in the proliferative/differentiative
balance in progenitors (Weijzen et al, 2002; Raouf et al, 2008).
Our most significant finding was that in a pre-clinical PDX model
of Numb� human BCs, Nutlin-3 treatment behaved as a CSC-specific
therapy that efficiently curbs the tumorigenic and metastatic poten-
tial of CSCs. We tailored the administration regimen (20 mg/kg
injected intraperitoneally every 3 days for a total of 12 days) to
minimize the apoptotic and necrotic effects associated with higher
concentrations and/or prolonged exposure to the drug (Kunkele
et al, 2012). In this regard, we note that our Nutlin-3 administration
protocol did not cause any significant effect on the growth rate of
the primary xenograft (Figs 6A and 7, left), a finding in keeping
with reports demonstrating minimal anti-tumoral effects of short-
term (1–2 weeks) Nutlin-3 treatments (Tovar et al, 2006; Vaseva
et al, 2011; Kunkele et al, 2012). Despite the apparent lack of effect
on the primary PDX growth, the use of assays to measure CSC activ-
ity (Gupta et al, 2009), such as the ability of primary PDX-derived
cells to form tumorspheres in vitro or to sustain secondary PDX
growth following re-transplantation, was able to unmask a specific
anti-CSC effect of the drug (Figs 6C and 7, middle/right).
These results are important in light of increasing concerns that
the primary endpoint to predict the clinical benefit of cancer thera-
peutics in clinical trials, that is, the objective tumor reduction
according
to
RECIST
(Response
Evaluation
Criteria
in
Solid
Tumors) criteria (Therasse et al, 2000), might underestimate the
effects of compounds with anti-CSC action (Liu & Wicha, 2010).
Indeed, while the degree of tumor shrinkage measures effects on
the bulk tumor cell population, selective targeting of the CSC pool
might not result in whole tumor size reduction assessed by the
conventional RECIST system. Our results provide evidence of such
a scenario and corroborate the idea that, as increasing efforts will
be directed to the specific targeting of the CSC compartment in
tumors, the design of Phase II trials should be overhauled and
integrated with additional biological endpoints based on the CSC
paradigm.

 Relevant to this point, we also provide preclinical evidence
that combining the anti-CSC-specific activity of Nutlin-3 with a
standard-of-care chemotherapeutic agent, paclitaxel, enhances the
therapeutic response of Numb� PDXs and overcomes drug resis-
tance to chemotherapy treatment. Extrapolated to the real clinical
setting of Numb� human BCs, our results argue that the combi-
nation of the anti-CSC effects of Nutlin-3 with standard tumor-
debulking treatments might represent a promising therapeutic
strategy.
Major efforts are being directed toward the restoration of p53
function in human cancers through the inhibition of Mdm2 (Burgess
et al, 2016). Indeed, several anti-Mdm2 compounds, related to
Nutlin-3, are currently in clinical development. However, clinical
trials with these compounds face major challenges, including the
lack of clear biomarkers for patient selection and the frequent occur-
rence of adverse effects (Ray-Coquard et al, 2012; Andreeff et al,
2016). Our results might help circumventing these problems. First,
at least in the models herein described based on the use of Numb�
and Numb+ BCs with a comparable WT-p53 status, the downregu-
lation of WT p53, which occurs in Numb� but not in Numb+ BCs,
was necessary for the anti-CSC effect of Nutlin-3. Thus, we submit
that the presence of WT p53 might not be a sufficient criterion for
eligibility to anti-Mdm2 therapies. Rather, patients should be strati-
fied for low levels of WT p53, either identified directly (something
that might prove technically challenging) or through surrogate
markers such as Numb status.
In addition, we note that the tailoring of the best regimen of
administration of anti-Mdm2 compounds might greatly benefit from
close-to-reality preclinical models that allow for accurate evaluation
of on-target and off-target effects of these drugs. The Numb� BC
PDXs might represent one such model. These tumors were respon-
sive to Nutlin-3 treatment under conditions that would have escaped
assessment of efficacy in mono-therapy, by RECIST criteria, since
the drug affected CSCs in the absence of necrotic/apoptotic effects
in the bulk tumor mass and in the absence of tumor shrinkage. We
do not know whether the absence of “toxic” effects on the tumor
would translate also in absent/reduced systemic toxicity for the
patient, at the doses of Nutlin-3 herein employed. If so, however,
Numb� BC PDXs might help in identifying the minimal efficacious
dose of Nutlin-3, or of other anti-Mdm2 compounds, to obtain effi-
cient anti-CSC targeting, while reducing general toxicity: a possibil-
ity that warrants further investigations.
Materials and Methods
Clinical samples
Fresh, frozen, or archival formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE)
mammary tissue specimens were collected at the European Institute
of Oncology (IEO, Milan, Italy). All tissues were collected via stan-
dard operating procedures approved by the Institutional Ethical
Board, and informed consent was obtained for all tissue specimens
linked with clinical data.
All BCs employed in this study possessed WT p53, assessed by
sequencing of the p53 coding sequence. Briefly, the human P53 gene
(NM_000546.5, 10 coding exons) was amplified by PCR starting
from genomic DNA extracted from FFPE samples. We designed
short amplicons (maximum size ~200 bp) to avoid possible prob-
lems due to degradation/fragmentation of DNA extracted from FFPE
samples. Since large exons were divided into more overlapping
amplicons, the entire p53 coding sequence was covered by 13 ampli-
cons (primers available upon request). Each forward and reverse
primer was designed with a 50 universal tail (PE21 forward; M13
reverse), which was subsequently used to directly sequence the PCR
fragments using BigDye v3.1 chemistry from Applied Biosystems.
The
sequencing
reactions
were
analyzed
with
the
Mutation
Surveyor software (SoftGenetics).
The Numb status was attributed to the tumors by measuring the
levels of Numb expression by IHC. Normal mammary tissues
displayed homogenous and intense Numb staining in the luminal
layers (IHC score 3) (see also Pece et al, 2004; Colaluca et al, 2008).
Tumors were classified on an IHC scale from 0 to 3 (0 = unde-
tectable expression, 3 = expression comparable to that of normal
luminal mammary cells). Tumors were classified as Numb� if
> 70% of the cells displayed a score ≤ 1, or as Numb+ if > 60% of
the cells displayed a score of 3.
In vivo studies using PDXs of Numb� and Numb+ human
breast cancers
To generate PDX models, fresh specimens from Numb� and Numb+
human BCs were cut into 4 × 2 mm pieces using a razor blade, remov-
ing necrotic tissue, if present. The resulting fragments were embedded
in ice-cold Matrigel (BD Matrigel
TM, BD Biosciences) and immediately
injected into the 4th inguinal mammary glands of 8-week-old female
Figure 7.
In vivo efficacy of Nutlin-3 and paclitaxel used as a monotherapies or in a combinatorial regimen.
Left panels: MECs derived from three Numb� (T5, T6, T7) and one Numb+ (TE) tumors were orthotopically transplanted into NGS mice and allowed to form tumors of ~100–
200 mm3. Mice were then randomly assigned to four groups of treatments (3–16 tumors per group): vehicle (Veh), Nutlin-3 (Nut), paclitaxel (Pacli), paclitaxel + Nutlin-3
(Pacli + Nut). Nutlin-3 (20 mg/kg dosed every 3 days for 4 doses) and paclitaxel (20 mg/kg dosed every 6 days for 3 doses) were administered for a period of 12 days
(Treatment). At day 15 (dashed red line), mice were sacrificed and explanted tumors (n ≥ 3 tumors/group) were pooled, digested, and used for in vivo tumorigenicity (middle
panels) or SFE (right panels) assays. Tumor regrowth was monitored following therapy discontinuation in mice (n ≥ 3 mice/group) treated with paclitaxel alone or in
combination with Nutlin-3 (post-treatment). Points of the growth curves represent the tumor volume expressed as the mean value of a single experiment (� SE of a minimum
of three to a maximum of 16 tumors). An unpaired two-sided Student’s t-test was used to analyze the degree of tumor shrinkage (expressed as %) in Pacli + Nut- vs. Pacli-
treated tumors at day 15 (T5, 33%, P = 0.048; T6, 60%, P = 0.228; T7, 94%, P = 0.022). A paired two-sided Student’s t-test was used to evaluate the overall tumor reduction
(measured at the end of post-treatment) in Pacli + Nut-treated tumors vs. baseline (T5, 72%, P = 3.75E-04; T6, 71%, P = 1.11E-03; T7, 100%, P = 6.93E-04). Middle panels:
Cells from pooled tumors (minimum three tumors per condition) explanted at day 15 were assessed for tumorigenicity (see Materials and Methods for experimental details).
Bars represent the tumor volume expressed as the mean value of a single experiment (� SE of a minimum of three to a maximum of eight tumors). Unpaired two-sided
Student’s t-test. *P < 0.05 vs. matching condition was considered as significant (P, Nut vs. Veh: T5 = 2.0E-04; T6 = 3.20E-04; T7 = 0.017; P, Pacli + Nut vs. Pacli: T5 =
6.37E-06; T6 = 6.50E-03; T7 = 5.40E-03). Right panels: SFE data are mean values of a single experiment (� SD of 12 measurements) and are expressed relative to the SFE or MS
size in control (Veh) cells (= 100%). Unpaired two-sided Student’s t-test. *P < 0.05 vs. matching condition was considered as significant (P, Nut vs. Veh: T5 = 3.0E-07;
T6 = 1.10E-07; T7 = 2.60E-06; P, Pacli + Nut vs. Pacli: T5 = 1.80E-12; T6 = 9.70E-12; T7 = 2.10E-05).

 NOD/SCID/IL2Rc�/� (NSG) mice (Jackson Laboratories stock #5557)
anesthetized by i.p. injection of 150 mg/kg tribromoethanol (Avertin).
Animals were euthanized when the tumor exceeded 10% of the body
mass in compliance with regulations for use of vertebrate animals in
research. The tumor volume was determined by measuring the tumor
in two dimensions and calculated using the mathematical formula for
a prolate ellipsoid: tumor volume = (L × W2)/2, where L = length of
the longest diameter; W = length of the shortest diameter. Female age-
matched animals were assigned randomly to the treatment (Numb
overexpression or Nutlin-3) or control (control vector or vehicle)
groups. Mice were monitored twice weekly by an investigator blinded
to treatment assignment. No animals were excluded from the analysis.
The size of the animal cohort was established with the aim to mini-
mize the number of animals used considering that inter-animal varia-
tions in the mammary fat pad engraftment is generally low starting
from fixed amounts of primary cells under standardized transplanta-
tion conditions.
Note that since tumor biopsy specimens are a limited source of
material and primary MECs can be propagated in culture only for a
limited number of generations, not all experiments could be
performed on the entire set of BCs. In all critical experiments, we
used a minimum of two Numb� and one Numb+ BCs in each case,
and frequently more.
For in vivo limiting dilution transplantation studies, decreasing
concentrations of cells dissociated from Numb� and Numb+ PDXs
were resuspended in a 1:1 volume of PBS/Matrigel and immediately
transplanted into the abdominal mammary gland of 8-week-old
female NSG mice. The transplantation frequency was calculated by
Poisson statistics, using the “StatMod” software package for the R
computing environment (http://www.R-project.org), as previously
described (Shackleton et al, 2006). A complementary log-log general-
ized linear model was used: two-sided 95% Wald confidence intervals
or, in case of zero outgrowths, one-sided 95% Clopper–Pearson inter-
vals. The single-hit assumption was tested as recommended and was
not rejected for any dilution series (P > 0.05). All in vivo experiments
were approved by the Italian Ministry of Health and performed in
accordance with the Italian laws (D.L.vo 116/92 and following addi-
tions), which enforce the EU 86/609 directive, and under the control
of the institutional organism for animal welfare and ethical approach
to animals in experimental procedures (Cogentech OPBA).
To test the in vivo efficacy of Nutlin and paclitaxel alone or in
combination regimens, cells dissociated from Numb� and Numb+
PDXs were resuspended in a 1:1 volume of PBS/Matrigel and
injected into the fat pad of 8-week-old NSG mice. Mice were
randomly assigned into the different treatment groups (from a mini-
mum of 3 to 8 mice per group) when tumors reached approximately
100–200 mm3. Animals received intraperitoneal injection of either
vehicle drug (10% DMSO, 10% polysorbate 80 in PBS) or Nutlin-3,
paclitaxel, or a combination of Nutlin-3 plus paclitaxel. Nutlin-3
was administered at 20 mg/kg dosed every 3 days (for a total of 4
doses) and paclitaxel at 20 mg/kg dosed every 6 days (for a total of
3 doses) over a period of 12 days. Changes in tumor burden were
assessed every 3 days with a caliper. All the tumor size measure-
ments were done by two investigators, with one investigator blinded
to the treatment group. For the studies performed using the tail vein
model of breast cancer lung metastasis, MECs dissociated from MSs
derived from two Numb� and two Numb+ primary tumors were
resuspended in 100 ll saline and injected via lateral tail vein in 7- to
8-week-old NSG mice. Two hundred and fifty thousand cells, treated
either with Nutlin-3 or vehicle as a control, were injected for each
Numb� or Numb+ tumor, using five mice for each treatment group.
Quantitative analysis of the lung metastatic tumor burden was
performed after 3 weeks post-injection.
Cells, reagents, and immunoblotting
Bulk mammary epithelial cells (MECs) were isolated from human
mammary tumor samples or from PDXs, and cultivated in suspension
culture to yield first (F1) or second (F2) generation mammospheres
(MSs), as previously described (Pece et al, 2010; Tosoni et al, 2012,
2015). Briefly, tumor biopsies or PDXs were mechanically dissociated
and enzymatically digested in DMEM/F12 medium supplemented
with 1 mM glutamine, 200 U/ml collagenase (Sigma), and 100 U/ml
hyaluronidase (Sigma) at 37°C for 4–5 h under rotating conditions.
Single cell suspensions were obtained through an additional incuba-
tion of digested tissues in 0.05% trypsin–EDTA for 5 min at 37°C.
Nutlin-3 was either purchased from Cayman Chemical or gener-
ously supplied by S. Minucci and M. Varasi (Drug Discovery Unit,
European Institute of Oncology, Milan, Italy). The (+)-enantiomer
Nutlin-3b was from Cayman Chemical. Cisplatin was from TEVA
ITALIA. MG132 was from Enzo Life Science. Paclitaxel (Taxol,
6 mg/ml) was from Bristol-Myers Squibb.
Antibodies for immunoblotting (IB) were directed against: tubu-
lin or vinculin (Sigma); Numb (AB21, a mouse monoclonal Ab
against a.a. 537–551 of hNumb; Colaluca et al, 2008); p53 (12C2)
and activated caspase-3 (Asp175)—Cell Signaling Technologies;
p21 (F-5; SantaCruz Biotechnology); GRP94 (9E10; Enzo Life
Sciences); b-catenin (BD Biosciences); Ki67 (SP6; Thermo Scientific
Lab Vision). Panels shown in the various IBs were assembled
either using lanes from the same blot (splicing out lanes loaded
with additional controls or non-relevant samples), or from dif-
ferent blots run and stained simultaneously. In some cases, given
the nature of the starting materials (primary cultures or MS estab-
lished immediately after surgery that do not last long in culture),
samples were run and immunoblotted at different times. When
these samples are displayed comparatively, they are derived from
gels in which internal controls (spliced out in the presentations)
were also loaded to allow for comparison. In all cases, the
splicings are clearly marked with solid bars or separated by white
lines. Details of primary antibodies and procedures used for flow

Engineering of vectors, shRNA experiments, and qPCR
The lentiviral construct harboring the Numb-DsRed and the Numb-
GFP fusion proteins and the procedures for lentiviral infection have
been previously described (Pece et al, 2010; Tosoni et al, 2015).
MSs from Numb� and Numb+ human BCs were dissociated, lentivi-
rally transduced with Numb-DsRed or with the control pLVX vector,
and cultured in non-adherent conditions for 7 days.
qRT–PCR analysis of cells from dissociated MSs was performed
using the TaqMan Cells-to-CT kit (Ambion), which allows gene
expression analysis from limited numbers of cells. Each sample was
tested in triplicate. For quantitation of gene expression changes in
each sample, the DCt method was used to calculate relative fold

 changes normalized against two different housekeeping genes.
TaqMan Gene Expression Assay IDs (Applied Biosystems, CA) were
as follows: Hs00355782-m1 (CDKN1A, NM_078467), Hs00234753-m1
(MDM2, NM_002392), Hs02387400-g1 (NANOG, NM_024865.2),
Hs99999905-m1 (GAPDH), Hs99999903-m1 (ACTB).
Imaging studies
Time-lapse video microscopy was performed with a Scan^R screen-
ing station (Olympus-SIS) equipped with a microscope incubation
chamber (Evotec). Cells from dissociated normal or tumor MSs were
re-suspended in methylcellulose in complete medium, plated onto
glass bottom dishes, and observed through a 10× 0.4 NA objective.
Both DIC and DsRed-epifluorescence images were collected with
auto-focusing procedures and compensated for focal shift. Different
focal planes were recorded to prevent loss of image contrast due to
axial cell movement. Images were captured every hour for 7 days,
starting 16–24 h after plating, and were reconstructed using the
ImageJ software. Confocal analyses were performed with a Leica
TCS SP2 AOBS microscope (see also Appendix Fig S2 for additional
experimental descriptions).
For the experiments described in Appendix Fig S2C, MECs from
the N1 specimen (normal counterpart of tumor T1) were lentivirally
transduced with Numb-GFP in adherent conditions and stained with
PKH26 (Sigma) before seeding them in suspension to allow MS
formation. Imaging was as above.
For IHC analysis, 3-lm-thick sections of FFPE primary tumors or
PDXs were assayed with the appropriate antibodies (Numb, clone
C29G11 and anti-activated caspase-3, clone Asp175 from Cell Signal-
ing Technologies; Ki67, clone SP6 from Thermo Scientific Lab
Vision). Slides were digitally scanned with the Aperio ScanScope XT.
For the quantitation of Ki67 and activated caspase-3 stainings, the
slides were automatically analyzed with the Aperio ImageScope IHC
algorithm (Aperio Technologies, Inc, Vista, CA, USA). Areas contain-
ing 30–60,000 cells were analyzed, and the percentage of positive
cells was calculated. Digital images were processed with Adobe
Photoshop CS3.

The paper explained
Problem
In many types of cancers, including breast cancer (BC), the intrinsic
refractoriness of cancer stem cells (CSC) to conventional anti-cancer
therapies is though to underlay therapy failure and disease progres-
sion. Thus, the elucidation of the molecular mechanisms responsible
for the emergence and maintenance of CSCs holds great promise
toward the development of targeted anti-CSC therapies.
Results
Using patient-derived xenografts (PDX), as a clinically relevant model of
Numb-deficient breast cancers (BC), we show that the unlimited self-
renewal and high tumorigenic potential of CSCs in Numb-deficient BCs
can be selectively reverted by re-expression of the tumor suppressor
Numb, or pharmacological restoration of p53 function with the Mdm2
inhibitor Nutlin-3. We further show that targeting the Numb/p53
dysfunction selectively interferes with the CSC compartment of Numb-
deficient BCs, with only modest, if any, effects at the level of the bulk
tumor population. The combined use of Nutlin-3 with standard
chemotherapy increases the response to therapy of Numb-deficient BCs.
Impact
Our work provides evidence of a molecular mechanism responsible for
the emergence and maintenance of CSCs in Numb-deficient BCs, which
represent a sizable fraction of naturally occurring and intrinsically
aggressive human BCs. Through the use of orthotopic PDX and specific
assays to study CSC biology, we provide proof-of-evidence that target-
ing the Numb/p53 dysfunction constitutes an effective anti-CSC therapy.
We also provide preclinical evidence that a selective anti-CSC therapy is
feasible, based on the elucidation of the mechanisms underlying the
emergence and the expansion of CSCs. Extrapolated to the real clinical
setting of human BCs, our results suggest that Numb represents a suit-
able predictive biomarker for eligibility to therapies able to restore p53
function, such as the Nutlin-related class of anti-Mdm2 inhibitors.
Furthermore, based on evidence that targeting p53 dysfunction potenti-
ates the response of Numb� BCs to chemotherapy, our results also pave
the way for a combinatorial treatment of these tumors.
