Objective: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is associated with insulin resistance and obesity.
Prospective population-based data regarding development and possible predictors of type 2
diabetes (T2D) in PCOS are limited.
Design: National Patient Register–based study.
Methods: Patients with PCOS [PCOS Denmark and embedded cohort, PCOS Odense University
Hospital (OUH)] and a control population with no previous diagnosis of T2D. PCOS OUH (N = 1,162)
included premenopausal women with PCOS and standardized clinical and biochemical examination.
PCOS Denmark (N = 18,477) included women with PCOS in the Danish National Patient Register.
Three age-matched controls were included per patient (N = 54,680).
Main outcome: T2D events according to diagnosis codes and filled medicine prescriptions.
Results: The median (quartiles) follow-up was 11.1 (6.9 to 16.0) years. The hazard ratio (HR) with
95% confidence interval (CI) for development of T2D in PCOS Denmark was HR = 4.0 (95% CI, 3.7 to
4.3; P , 0.001), and the total event rate of T2D was 8.0 per 1000 person years in PCOS Denmark vs 2.0
per 1000 person years in controls (P , 0.001). The median age at diagnosis of T2D was 31 (26 to 37)
years in PCOS Denmark vs 35 (27 to 44) years in controls (P , 0.001). In multiple regression
analyses, body mass index, glycated hemoglobin, fasting blood glucose, 2-hour blood glucose,
homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance, and triglycerides were positively associated
with development of T2D, whereas higher number of births was negatively associated with
development of T2D.
Conclusion: The event rate of T2D was higher in PCOS compared with controls, and T2D was
diagnosed at a younger age. (J Clin Endocrinol Metab 102: 3848–3857, 2017)
P
olycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is most often de-
fined according to the Rotterdam criteria, which
include irregular ovulation, biochemical/clinical hyper-
androgenism, and/or polycystic ovaries when other eti-
ologies are excluded (1, 2). Insulin resistance is part of the
pathogenesis of PCOS (3) and insulin resistance is as-
sociated with increased risk of type 2 diabetes (T2D) in
PCOS (4–7). Insulin resistance is closely associated with
obesity (3, 8). As recently reviewed, evidence regarding the
increased risk of T2D in PCOS is based on observational

 studies with high risk of bias (4), and data from population-
based studies are limited (9, 10). High body mass index
(BMI), increasing age, consecutive pregnancies, and treat-
ment with oral contraceptives (OCP) could modify the risk
of development of T2D in PCOS, but no data are available
from prospective studies. In women with T2D, a diagnosis
of PCOS was associated with higher BMI and earlier onset
of diabetes (11). Increasing age is associated with loss of
beta cell function (12) and age .40 years is considered an
additional risk factor for T2D in PCOS in some guidelines
(13–15). The prevalence of gestational diabetes mellitus
(GDM) is increased in PCOS (16) and cumulative weight-
gain during successive pregnancies would increase the risk
of developing T2D in PCOS (17). Fasting insulin levels were
unchanged during treatment with OCP in PCOS (18). Use
of OCP could, however, be associated with increased risk of
T2D due to weight gain (19, 20) and use of OCP could lead
to higher levels of glucose and insulin levels during oral
glucose test (OGTT) (20, 21).
The aim of the present register-based study was to
investigate the risk of development of T2D in women
with PCOS and possible modifying effects of age, number
of births, and prescription of OCP. We extracted di-
agnosis codes in the Danish National Patient Register
(NPR) and medical prescriptions from the National
Prescriptions Registry. Possible associations between
baseline clinical and biochemical characteristics and
later development of T2D were investigated in a well-
described representative subgroup of patients with
hyperandrogenism and/or PCOS.
Material and Methods
The study design and baseline data for this study have recently
been reported in detail (10). Briefly, the study used an obser-
vational register-based cohort drawn from Danish national
health registers including two patient populations with PCOS
and one control population (Fig. 1). The PCOS cohort included
all women in Denmark aged 12 to 60 years, who were diagnosed
through a hospital contact with PCOS (E282) and/or hirsutism
(L680) between 1 January 1995 and the end of 2012 (PCOS
Denmark).
For each patient with PCOS, three control women born in
the same year as the patient were randomly drawn from the civil
population register. Controls were assigned the index date (date
of first PCOS diagnosis) of their matched PCOS cases. Within

Women with the diagnoses E221 (hyperprolactinemia), E220 (acromegaly), E24 (Cushing’s syndrome), E25 (adrenogenital syndrome), and Q96
(Turner syndrome) were excluded from the cohort. T2D was defined as: (1) ICD-10: E11 (noninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus), E14 (unspecified
diabetes mellitus), or O24 (diabetes mellitus in pregnancy); (2) prescription of drugs for treatment of diabetes excluding prescription of metformin
(A10BA02); or (3) HbA1c $6.5% (48 mmol/mol) and/or blood glucose $11.1 mmol/L (fasting or during a 2-hour OGTT) in PCOS OUH.

 PCOS Denmark, we embedded a local subcohort of women
with PCOS and/or hirsutism treated at Odense University
Hospital (PCOS OUH). For the current study, estimated
glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and glycated hemoglobin
(HbA1c) measured at baseline were included in the dataset
(10) along with prospective results of HbA1c and blood
glucose (BG) samples analyzed at our hospital. These samples
included samples drawn by in- and outpatient clinics at the
hospital and samples sent to analysis by general practitioners
on Funen.
Assays in PCOS OUH subcohort
Serum total testosterone was analyzed using a specific
radioimmunoassay after extraction as previously described
(22) and sex hormone–binding globulin (SHBG) was ana-
lyzed by an autoDelfia assay. The intra-assay coefficient of
variation (CV) for the total testosterone assay was 8.2% and
5.2% for SHBG. The interassay CV for the total testosterone
assay was 13.8% and 7.5% for SHBG. Insulin was analyzed
by a time-resolved fluoroimmunoassay using a commercial
kit (AutoDelfia; Wallac Oy, Turku, Finland) with an intra-
assay variation of 2.1% to 3.7% and interassay variation of
3.4% to 4.0%. Plasma creatinine, total cholesterol, high-
density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglycerides were ana-
lyzed by enzymatic colorimetric reactions (Modular P;
Roche, Hvidovre, Denmark), while low-density lipoprotein
cholesterol was calculated using the Friedewald equation. BG
was measured on capillary ear blood using Hemo Cue. We
calculated the homeostasis model assessment of insulin re-
sistance (HOMA-ir = fasting insulin 3 fasting BG / 22.5)
(23). HbA1c was measured by high-performance liquid
chromatography as fraction of total hemoglobin A0 using
Tosoh G8 (Medinor, Broendby, Denmark) with reagents as
recommended by the supplier. The analytical CV was 0.9%.
eGFR was calculated from plasma creatinine values using the
simplified four-variable “modification of diet in renal dis-
ease” equation without correction for race (24).
During 1997 to 2003, OGTT was part of the routine
evaluation program for newly referred women with PCOS (25).
P-insulin and capillary BG were measured at fasting and 30, 60,
and 120 minutes after oral ingestion of a glucose load con-
taining the equivalent of 75 g anhydrous glucose dissolved
in water.
The Danish health registries
All individuals in Denmark are assigned a unique personal
identification number and data from national registers can
therefore be linked at an individual level. We retrieved in-
formation about hospital contacts and medicine prescriptions
filled, along with dates of death if applicable, in women with
PCOS and control subjects from NPR, the National Prescription
Registry, and the National Cause of Death Register from 1995
to 31 December 2015.
Exposure
Use of OCP, use of metformin and number of births were
used as exposures. Uses of OCP (Anatomical Therapeutic
Chemical codes G03AA, G03AB, and G03HB01) and met-
formin (Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical code A10BA02)
were defined as two or more dispenses of medicine prescriptions
in the National Prescription Registry. Number of births [In-
ternational Classification of Diseases (ICD)-10 codes O80-O84]
were categorized as 0, 1, 2, or $3 and extracted from NRP. The
covariates were defined before the index date in baseline tables
and if present during the time span of the study from 1995 to 31
December 2015 or to an outcome event occurred.
Outcome
The primary outcome was T2D, defined as at least one of
the following criteria. (1) The presence of a diabetes diagnosis
in NPR according to ICD-10: E11 (noninsulin dependent
diabetes mellitus), E14 (unspecified diabetes mellitus), or O24
(diabetes mellitus in pregnancy); (2) prescription of drugs
for treatment of diabetes according to the National Pre-
scriptions Registry database: A10 (antidiabetics), excluding
prescription of metformin (A10BA02); or (3) in PCOS OUH,
the occurrence of HbA1c $6.5% (48 mmol/mol) and/or BG
$11.1 mmol/L (fasting or during 2-hour OGTT) was defined
as incident diabetes. In regression analyses including number
of births as predictors of T2D, O24 was excluded from T2D
events. Women with known T2D and women with newly
diagnosed T2D during baseline evaluation for PCOS were
excluded, and therefore, participants with T2D events oc-
curring before and up until 3 months after the index date
were excluded.
Statistical analyses
Descriptive analyses for categorical variables were presented
as frequencies and difference between PCOS and control group
was evaluated by x2 test. Continuous variables were tabulated
as medians (with quartiles 1 and 3) and nonparametric test on
the equality of medians were used to test for differences between
groups. P values below 0.05 were considered statistically
significant.
Cox proportional hazard models were used to calculate
incidence rates per 1000 person years (PY), hazard ratios (HRs)
and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs), and corresponding
P values for outcomes (T2D with GDM included or excluded).
The analysis including the total cohort (PCOS Denmark and
controls) was carried out as crude HR, only including the ex-
posure, and adjusted for OCP in analysis when the outcome was
T2D including GMD. In the analyses where outcome was T2D
excluding GDM, adjusted analyses were reported with OCP
and number of births. The matching of PCOS and controls was
taken into account by estimating stratified baseline hazard for
each matching set. Analyses were conducted using STATA 14
through a remote virtual private network access to Statistics
Denmark.
Ethics
The core study was an open register-based cohort study. The
study did not need approval from the local ethics committee or
institutional review board by Danish law. The study was ap-
proved by the Data Protection Agency and by Statistics Den-
mark (project no. 704175).
Results
The flowchart of included women is summarizedin Fig. 1. A
total of 18,477 women with PCOS (PCOS Denmarkandthe
embedded cohort PCOS OUH, N = 1,162) and 54,680
controls were included in the study.

 Baseline characteristics
PCOS Denmark vs controls
Women in PCOS Denmark had higher prevalence
of ICD-10 codes and medicine prescriptions related to
the metabolic syndrome occurring before the index
date compared with controls, higher prescription of
OCP and drugs for fertility treatment and higher
number of births before the index date (18% vs 13%
had $ 1 births) than controls (Supplemental Tables 1
and 2).
Baseline clinical and biochemical data in PCOS OUH
The prevalence of women in PCOS OUH with
BMI ,25 kg/m2 was 40% (430/1082), BMI between
25 and 29.9 kg/m2 was 25% (273/1082), and BMI $
30 kg/m2 was 35% (379/1082). The majority of women
in PCOS OUH fulfilled the Rotterdam criterion of
hyperandrogenism (biochemical and/or clinical; 1074/
1156 = 93%), and 33% (387/1159) women fulfilled all
three Rotterdam criteria.
T2D event rates
The median (quartiles 1 to 3) follow-up duration was
11.1 (6.9 to 16.0) years (Table 1). The incidence rate of T2D
was 9/1000 PYs in PCOS OUH, 8/1000 PYs in PCOS
Denmark, and 2/1000 PYs in controls (P , 0.001 PCOS
Denmark vs controls). Ten events of T2D in PCOS OUH
were defined by HbA1c $6.5% (N = 9) or BG $11.1
mmol/L (N = 1) in women with no ICD-10 diagnosis of
T2D and no prescription of antidiabetic medicine.
The incidence rates for T2D were comparable in the
four different PCOS phenotypes: phenotype A (all three
Rotterdam criteria present, N = 387), 9.8/1000 PYs;
phenotype B (hyperandrogenism and oligomenorrhea,
N = 232), 9.7/1000 PYs; phenotype C (hyperandrogenism
and polycystic ovary, N = 106), 9.5/1000 PYs; and phe-
notype D (oligomenorrhea and polycystic ovary, N = 49),
13.7/1000 PYs, P = 0.85.
Baseline characteristics According to development
of T2D in PCOS OUH
Women in PCOS OUH who developed T2D were
significantly older, more obese (higher BMI and waist
circumference), had higher glucose (fasting and 2-hour),
insulin, HOMA-ir, more adverse lipid profile (low-
density lipoprotein, high-density lipoprotein, choles-
terol, triglycerides), and lower SHBG upon baseline
evaluation compared with women in PCOS OUH and no
development of T2D, whereas the two groups were
comparable regarding testosterone levels (total and free
testosterone) and renal function (Table 2). The preva-
lence of HbA1c ,42 mmol/L at baseline was significantly
lower in women in PCOS OUH with later development of
T2D compared with women in PCOS OUH that did not
develop T2D (43/115 = 37% vs 495/1047 = 47%),
whereas the prevalence of fasting BG ,6.1 mmol/L and
2-hour BG ,7.8 mmol/L was comparable between the
two groups (data not shown).
Characteristics According to development of T2D in
PCOS Denmark and controls
PCOS Denmark vs controls
The prescription of OCP (71% PCOS vs 34%
controls) and metformin (26% PCOS vs 2% controls)
occurring after the index date and the number of
births (46% PCOS vs 26% controls had $1 birth) was
significantly higher in PCOS Denmark vs controls
(Table 3).

 Women with development of T2D in PCOS Denmark
vs controls
The median age at T2D diagnosis was significantly lower
in PCOS Denmark vs controls (31 vs 35 years, P , 0.001),
and 82% vs 66% were aged ,40 years at T2D diagnosis,
respectively (P , 0.001). When GDM was excluded from
T2D diagnosis, the median age at T2D diagnosis was
33 vs 38 years in PCOS vs controls (P , 0.001).

 Prescription of metformin and OCP and number of
births (30% PCOS vs 9% controls had $1 birth) were
significantly higher in women in PCOS Denmark with
development of T2D compared with controls with
development of T2D.
PCOS Denmark and development of diabetes yes
vs no
Women in PCOS Denmark that developed T2D were
significantly older than women in PCOS Denmark without
development of T2D (31 vs 29 years, P , 0.001), the
prevalence of ever users of OCP was lower, the prevalence
of ever users of metformin was higher and the number of
births was lower (30% vs 53% had $ 1 births).
Regression analyses
The HR for development of T2D was 4.0 (95% CI, 3.7
to 4.3) in PCOS Denmark vs controls when GDM was
included, and the HR for T2D in PCOS was 3.5 (95% CI,
3.2 to 3.8) when GDM was excluded (Tables 4 and 5). In
regression models, where GDM was included as a T2D
outcome, prescription of OCP was statistically associated
with a higher risk of T2D (HR = 1.4; 95% CI, 1.3 to 1.6),
whereas higher number of births decreased the risk of
T2D. However, use of OCP was not associated with
increased risk of T2D when GDM was not part of the
diabetes outcome (HR = 1.0; 95% CI, 0.9 to 1.2). We
found a significant interaction between PCOS diagnosis
and age (HR = 0.96; 95% CI, 0.96 to 0.97, P , 0.001).
In PCOS OUH, HbA1c, fasting BG, 2-hour BG,
HOMA-r, triglycerides, SHBG, age, and BMI upon
baseline were predictors of development of T2D
(Table 5). When models were corrected for age and BMI,
fasting BG, 2-hour BG, and triglycerides were the best
predictors of development of T2D.
Discussion
In the current study we found an odds ratio of 4.0 for
the development of T2D and GDM in a nationwide
population-based cohort of women with PCOS, and T2D
was diagnosed on average 4 years earlier in PCOS. Higher
number of pregnancies was associated with lower risk of
T2D among women with PCOS. In a representative sub-
group of women with PCOS from our outpatient clinic, the
risk of T2D was adversely affected by higher BMI, lipids,
insulin and glucose levels upon PCOS diagnosis. The PCOS
OUH cohort was relatively lean (median BMI = 26.9 kg/m2)
upon PCOS diagnosis, but 10% women developed T2D
during a median follow-up of 11.1 years.
To our knowledge, this is the first nationwide study to
describe prospective risk of T2D in PCOS and the
modifying effect of several risk factors. First, we could
confirm results from a recent meta-analysis where the
odds ratio for T2D was 4.4 in women with PCOS
compared with controls (4).The meta-analysis included
data from smaller observational studies in selected
populations of women with PCOS (4), whereas few
nationwide data set regarding risk for T2D in PCOS are
available (9, 10). We recently reported that 1.5% women
had been diagnosed with T2D at the time of their di-
agnosis of PCOS compared with 0.4% of non-PCOS
controls, which corresponded to a five times increased
likelihood of T2D in PCOS at presentation (10). The risk
for T2D is closely associated with BMI, and T2D was
very uncommon in normal weight women at the time of
diagnosis of PCOS (25, 26). A recent population-based
Finnish study reported a synergistic effect of overweight/
obesity and PCOS for the risk of development of T2D,
whereas the risk of T2D was not increased in normal
weight women with PCOS (7). Two previous observa-
tional studies from the United States and one from
Australia reported T2D prevalence of 10% (mean age =
26.5 years, BMI = 37.1 kg/m2) (27), 7.5% (mean age =
28 years, BMI = 32.9 kg/m2) (27), and 5.8% (mean age =
20.5 years, BMI = 28.0 kg/m2) (28), respectively. These
findings support a relatively low baseline risk of T2D in
Danish women with PCOS compared with other na-
tionalities. Only hospital diagnoses are included in NPR
and patients receiving no diabetes medications and
needing no hospital appointments for their diabetes
would not be identified as having T2D in our dataset.

 However, the current study design could favor patients
with a more severe PCOS phenotype, which would affect
our risk estimates. In comparison, the HR for develop-
ment of T2D was 3.0 in women with PCOS compared
with controls (event rates = 5.7/1000 PYs vs 1.7/1000
PYs, P , 0.001) during a median follow-up of 4.5 years
in a British study using data from the General Practice
Research Database (9). The study included 21,740
women with PCOS and mean BMI of 28.7 kg/m2 and age
of 27.1 years at baseline (9). The lower event rate for T2D
in the British study compared with our data could,
however, also be explained by a relatively short follow-up
duration in a young study cohort. Prospective studies are
needed in more obese study populations with higher
absolute risk of T2D, but available data support that the
RR for T2D is relatively conserved in women with PCOS
compared with controls independent of baseline risk profile.
We found that the median age at T2D diagnosis was
significantly lower in PCOS Denmark vs controls and
82% vs 66% was aged ,40 years at T2D diagnosis.
These data suggest that the majority of T2D cases in
PCOS were diagnosed already before the age of 40 years
and during multiple regression analysis, age was not a
strong predictor of T2D development. Furthermore, age
and PCOS showed a significant interaction, supporting
that PCOS was stronger associated with development of
T2D in young than in older age. BMI and age are closely
associated (29, 30), and in accordance, the significant
association between age and T2D development became
nonsignificant after correcting for BMI. Increasing age
was considered an important predictor for T2D in PCOS
and guidelines suggested that screening for T2D was
especially relevant in women with PCOS aged .40 years
(13–15). Overall, our data support that the inclusion of
increasing age as a separate risk parameter is not rele-
vant in future algorithms regarding screening for T2D
in PCOS.
Testosterone levels (free and total) measured at
baseline did not predict later development of T2D in
PCOS OUH and the incidence rate of T2D was com-
parable between different PCOS phenotypes. The im-
portance of individual Rotterdam criteria, especially
hyperandrogenism, for metabolic risk in PCOS is cur-
rently debated. Women in PCOS OUH were relatively
lean and 93% had clinical and/or biochemical hyper-
androgenism, which could have affected study results.
However, we recently reported that the presence of in-
dividual Rotterdam criteria was not associated with
cardiometabolic diagnoses upon diagnosis in PCOS
OUH despite a more adverse metabolic risk profile in
women with polycystic ovaries and irregular menses (10).
The present results were in accordance with a Chinese
study in 2436 women with PCOS reporting no impact of
PCOS phenotype on glucose tolerance (31). Importantly,
mean BMI varies between different PCOS phenotypes
(32, 33), and studies regarding metabolic risk should
adjust for BMI. Different results could be found in more
obese study populations predominantly consisting of
other PCOS phenotypes. Further prospective studies are
needed to determine if the long-term metabolic risk is
affected by PCOS phenotype independent of BMI or
lipid levels.
OCP are often used to treat hyperandrogenism and
irregular menses in PCOS. In accordance, 71% women in
PCOS Denmark vs 34% controls were treated with OCP.
We found that treatment with OCP increased the risk of

 T2D in PCOS Denmark, but this became nonsignificant
when GDM was excluded from T2D diagnosis and
number of births was added as predictor of T2D devel-
opment. These results could suggest a confounding effect
of pregnancies for effect of OCP treatment on develop-
ment of T2D. In pregnancy, maternal insulin sensitivity
changes to accommodate fetal glucose needs, with insulin
resistance prevailing in the third trimester (34). The risk
of GDM was more than six times increased in PCOS
Denmark and PCOS OUH compared with controls in the
current study, but in multiple regression analyses, higher
number of births decreased the risk of T2D. The most
straightforward explanation could be that multiple
pregnancies indicate a less severe PCOS phenotype and
therefore also a lower risk of later developing T2D. The
possible metabolic risk of OCP is discussed. We and
others reported increased insulin levels during OGTT in
women with PCOS treated with OCP (21, 35) along
with weight gain (19), which could increase the risk of
development of T2D. The risk of venous thromboem-
bolism is increased in PCOS and increases further during
use of OCP (36). Therefore, OCP should not be pre-
scribed in high-risk individuals, and this could affect
study results. The number of births was higher in PCOS
Denmark vs controls, which supported that PCOS was
often diagnosed as part of fertility treatment. The
number of births was reduced in obese study pop-
ulations with PCOS (37), but our study confirms that
fertility is not reduced in relatively lean study pop-
ulations with PCOS.
The inclusion of PCOS OUH allowed us to investi-
gate associations between baseline metabolic screen-
ing and later development of T2D. Glucose levels at
fasting and during OGTT, fasting insulin, and HOMA-ir
levels were higher upon baseline evaluation in women
with later development of T2D compared with women
without development of T2D. Furthermore, the lipid
profile was more unfavorable and SHBG levels were
lower. In multiple regression analyses, fasting BG, 2-hour
BG, and triglycerides were the best predictors of devel-
opment of T2D after correcting for age and BMI. We
found that the regression model including fasting BG
showed the highest HR for T2D development. In ac-
cordance, fasting BG is applied in many prediction
models for risk of developing T2D in non PCOS pop-
ulations (38), but we are not aware of such models in
PCOS study populations. HbA1c is a measure of average
glucose levels and could be a better predictor of car-
diovascular disease and overall mortality than fasting or
2-hour glucose (39). However, the current study did not
support that HbA1c levels at baseline were superior to
other glucose measures as indicator for increased risk of
T2D in PCOS.
The strength and limitations of the current study have
in part been described recently (10). Our study was na-
tionwide and the embedded cohort of PCOS OUH with
available clinical and biochemical data allowed us to test
hypotheses that could not be tested in the national cohort.
PCOS OUH and PCOS Denmark were comparable re-
garding presence of cardio-metabolic diagnoses before
the index date (10) and regarding their likelihood of
development of T2D. Some limitations may however
apply to our study as we only included women with
PCOS diagnosed during hospital contacts. Therefore,
some women in the control group may have undiagnosed
PCOS, which could lead to underestimation of T2D risk
in PCOS. An ICD-10 diagnosis of type 1 diabetes was
excluded from T2D definition, but some patients with
type 1 diabetes could have been included in the study
population due to prescriptions of antidiabetic medicine.
Women were included after the diagnosis of PCOS,
whereas type 1 diabetes is most often diagnosed in young
age. Hence, inclusion of patients with type 1 diabetes is
unlikely to have taken place to any major degree.
In conclusion, the risk of development of T2D was
significantly increased in PCOS and T2D was diagnosed
at a younger age. BMI and fasting BG were the best
predictors of development of T2D in PCOS, whereas our
data supported that increasing age should not be included
in future guidelines as an isolated risk marker of T2D
development in PCOS. Future studies are needed to
evaluate the effect of OCP and number of births on risk of
T2D in PCOS.
