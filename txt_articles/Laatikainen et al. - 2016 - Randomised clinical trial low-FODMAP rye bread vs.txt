SUMMARY
Background
Grains are high in FODMAPs (Fermentable Oligo-, Di-, Monosaccharides
And Polyols) and often considered as triggers of IBS symptoms.
Aim
To evaluate if rye bread low in FODMAPs would be better tolerated than
regular rye bread in subjects with IBS.
Methods
The study was conducted as a randomised double blind controlled cross-
over study (n = 87). Participants were supplied with both regular rye bread
and low-FODMAP rye bread for 4 weeks. Symptoms were measured with a
symptom severity scoring system (IBS-SSS) and visual analogue scale (VAS)
assessments of individual symptoms. Quality of life was monitored. Colonic
fermentation was measured by the breath hydrogen test and dietary intake
by food diaries.
Results
Dietary fibre intake increased during both study periods compared to base-
line. Many signs of IBS i.e. flatulence, abdominal pain, cramps and stomach
rumbling were milder on the low-FODMAP rye bread (P-values: 0.04;
0.049; 0.01 and 0.001). The mean of VAS measurements was favourable
towards LF bread [�3 (95% CI): �6 to �1, P = 0.02] but no differences
were detected in IBS-SSS or quality of life. The AUC of breath hydrogen
values was significantly lower during the low-FODMAP bread period (me-
dian 52.9 vs. 72.6; P = 0.01).
Conclusions
Low-FODMAP rye bread helps IBS patients to control their symptoms and
reduces gastrointestinal gas accumulation. However, replacing regular rye
bread
by
low-FODMAP
bread
without
concomitant
broader
dietary
changes does not improve quality of life or IBS-SSS. Nonetheless, inclusion
of low-FODMAP rye bread in diet might be one way that IBS patients
could increase their fibre intake.

 INTRODUCTION
Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common functional
gastrointestinal disorder. It affects, on average, 11% of
the adult population in the developed countries.1 IBS
causes substantial human suffering as well as having
financial consequences.2
The role of diet in triggering IBS symptoms has
long been recognised but only limited amounts of diet-
ary research have been performed. IBS patients typi-
cally report intolerance of wheat, milk, onion, garlic,
apples, alcohol, coffee, chili and beans.3, 4 The role of
colonic fermentation of indigestible carbohydrates has
attracted
considerable
research
interest.
Australian
researchers from Monash University have introduced
the concept of Fermentable Oligo-, Di-, Monosaccha-
rides and Polyols (FODMAPs).5 FODMAPs are simple
carbohydrates which are unabsorbed in small intestine
but rapidly and extensively fermented in the upper
part of the colon. In the presence of impaired handling
of intestinal gas, abnormalities in bowel motility and
visceral sensitivity, it is the rapid fermentation which is
postulated to trigger IBS symptoms. It is now widely
accepted that FODMAPs are at least one of the cul-
prits behind the so-called subjective gluten or wheat
sensitivity.6
Recent clinical studies have provided support for the
FODMAP theory. There are now several randomised
controlled trials and observational studies demonstrating
the beneficial effect of a low-FODMAP diet in IBS.7
Generally, in these studies, the entire dietary pattern has
been modified to achieve a broad restriction of dietary
FODMAPs. In contrast, the role of single food items
high in FODMAPs in IBS is poorly understood.
Whole grain rye bread is considered as a healthy food,
mainly because of its high fibre content (11–14%).8 In
Finland, rye is the single most important source of diet-
ary fibre, accounting for 28–35% of fibre intake of work-
ing age adults.9 In a Danish prospective study, a high
consumption of rye bread was associated with a lower
risk of death in men.10 Rye bread increases satiety,11
reduces the insulin response compared to that encoun-
tered after an isocaloric wheat-based meal.12 By consum-
ing rye bread, the individual increases his/her intake of
cereal fibre which is linked to a reduced risk of colorectal
cancer.13 Bread, as such, is important part of the daily
diet all over the Western world.
Rye bread is also high in fructans.14 According to a
Finnish study, rye grain typically contains 4.4–6.6 g of
fructans per 100 g and most of these fructans are
classified as fructooligosaccharides (FOS) such as 1-kes-
tose.8 FOS is a short chain carbohydrate that is not
digested by mammalian enzymes and as such can be
classified as a FODMAP.
In a retrospective study, 91% of IBS patients reported
tolerating small amounts of wheat-free rye bread despite
its high-FODMAP content.15 However, it is not known
whether lowering the fructan content of rye bread would
be of any help in controlling IBS symptoms, and would
patients be able to increase the amounts of rye bread in
their diet if the fructan content was lowered during the
baking process. As far as we are aware, there are no ran-
domised studies which would have investigated whether
rye can be linked with IBS symptoms.
This study aimed to determine whether a simple sub-
stitution of low-FODMAP rye bread for regular rye
bread (high in FODMAPs), without any other concomi-
tant dietary changes, affects the symptoms and gas accu-
mulation or quality of life in IBS patients. Therefore, the
effects on gastrointestinal symptoms of low-FODMAP-
rye bread and regular rye bread alone were compared in
a
randomised,
double-blinded,
cross-over
study
in
patients with IBS who did not follow strict low-FOD-
MAP or any other type of elimination diet. Furthermore,
we evaluated the intake of dietary fibre at baseline and
during the intervention.
SUBJECTS
A total of 87 patients with IBS were recruited via the
Internet and from individuals attending a private hospi-
tal clinic (Aava Medical Centre, Helsinki, Finland). The
two eligibility inclusion criteria were (i) subjects were
aged 18–65 years and (ii) had IBS as defined by the
Rome III criteria.16 Exclusion criteria included the pres-
ence of an organic GI disease, such as inflammatory
bowel disease, coeliac disease, major abdominal surgery,
any malignancy, pregnancy or breastfeeding, inability to
tolerate rye, strict low-FODMAP diet or other elimina-
tion diet, or taking some medication potentially influenc-
ing gastrointestinal function.
Study candidates were pre-screened by a study dieti-
cian. Those meeting the preliminary inclusion criteria
were subsequently referred to a screening consultation
with a gastroenterologist to assess further their eligibility
for participating in the study. Blood count, sedimenta-
tion rate, transglutaminase antibodies for coeliac disease
and thyroid function tests were performed at the physi-
cian’s screening visit, if these tests had not already been
performed within the past 12 months. Laboratory tests

Randomised clinical trial: low FODMAPs and irritable bowel syndrome
 were done in order to screen eligible patients. Patients
were provided with the obligatory written, informed con-
sent forms which they all signed.
The study protocol was approved by the ethics com-
mittee of the Hospital District of Helsinki and Uusimaa.
The trial was registered at the US National Institutes of
Health (Clinical Trials.gov) #NCT02161120.
METHODS
Study design
This study was a randomised, double blind, 2 9 2 cross-
over study with a 1-week run-in period on usual diet,
followed by two 4-week treatment periods during which
the patients received either the low-FODMAP rye bread
or the regular rye bread, and a washout period of
≥4 weeks between these two periods. Randomisation was
performed in blocks of four as a nonconcealed alloca-
tion. An independent person who was not involved with
the study generated the randomisation list. The randomi-
sation was blinded for both the participants and the
investigators.
Study breads
The breads were developed and supplied by Fazer Bak-
eries (Vantaa, Finland). Both rye bread recipes contained
the same amount of wholegrain rye flour, wheat flour
and other ingredients. The breads had a similar appear-
ance, taste and were packaged in transparent plastic
pouches (Figure S1). The control bread was prepared
using traditional rye sourdough whereas the low-FOD-
MAP rye bread was prepared using a specific sourdough
system which resulted in rye bread with a clearly lower
FODMAP (fructan and mannitol) content (Table 1).
The nutrient composition was analysed by Eurofins
scientific Finland, Raisio (Food & Agro), Finland. The
dietary fibre content of the breads was determined using
the AOAC method 2011.25, discriminating soluble and
insoluble, low and high molecular weight dietary fibres.
Resistant starch was determined using AOAC 2002.02
method and mannitol by HPAEC method used by Euro-
fins Food &Agro, Lidk€
oping, Sweden. Fructan content
was measured using the AOAC 999.03 method (Mega-
zyme assay kit K-FRUC; Megazyme international Ireland
Ltd, Bray, Ireland). A Lactobacillus strain was identified
in the sourdough which efficiently consumed fructans
and prevented mannitol accumulation during proofing,
and thus resulting in lower FODMAP content of low-
FODMAP rye bread.
Subjects were asked to follow their usual diet, and
they were asked to keep 4-day food records during the
run-in and during both treatment periods. Patients were
advised to consume 7–8 slices of rye bread per day
depending on the individual energy need during 2nd,
3rd and 4th week. During the first week of treatment
periods, the targeted rye bread dose was half, i.e. 3.5–4
slices. Adherence to bread consumption was evaluated
by patient entries into a tick-box diary for each treat-
ment period and also by food records.
IBS-SSS
The primary outcome variable was IBS-SSS (IBS-Symp-
tom Severity Score) as described by Francis et al.17 The
individual symptoms were assessed at the baseline (week

 0) and at weeks 2 and 4 during the study periods. The
overall IBS-SSS score (=abdominal pain + number of
days of abdominal pain during the last 10 days ((number
of days with abdominal pain)*10) + abdominal disten-
sion + satisfaction of defecatory behaviour + interference
of IBS symptoms) was calculated for weeks 2 and 4 and
for both study periods. The possible range was then
0–500.15 The mean values of weeks 2 and 4 were calcu-
lated for the individual symptoms and for the overall
IBS-SSS score.
Weekly IBS symptoms
IBS-SSS includes only some aspects of the gastrointesti-
nal symptoms experienced by IBS patients. Therefore, we
constructed an additional questionnaire to assess other
symptoms related to IBS. This questionnaire was also
based on visual analogue scale (VAS) and assessed the
severity of diarrhoea, constipation, abdominal cramps
and pain, flatulence, stomach rumbling, heartburn, dys-
pepsia, incomplete feeling of defecation and urgency in
defecation.
A
total
of
10
symptoms
were
recorded
(VAS
0–100 mm for each) at the baseline (week 0) and during
study weeks 1, 2, 3 and 4 during both study periods. A
total symptom score (= mean of all ten symptoms) was
calculated for each week. The mean values of weeks 1, 2,
3 and 4 were calculated for the individual symptoms and
for the total symptom score. We did not formally vali-
date the questionnaire containing 10 different symptoms
but it follows the practise and idea as described by Fran-
cis et al.17 A similar scoring system has been used previ-
ously in other diet studies in IBS.18
Quality of life
Each study subject also filled in a Finnish language ver-
sion of the validated IBS-QoL19 as a further secondary
outcome. The quality of life questionnaire was filled in at
the baseline (week 0), and after the both study periods at
week 4.
Other outcome variables
Breath
hydrogen
was
measured
with
Gastrolyzer
(Bedfont Scientific Ltd, Kent, UK) at the baseline and 12
times at 30 min intervals during the 6 h after eating the
study breads. To minimise variables that might affect
breath hydrogen production, subjects were asked to
restrain from vigorous physical activity and instructed to
consume a standard breakfast containing three slices of
the study breads, spread, cheese or ham, tomato and/or
cucumber and water. Coffee and tea were allowed.
Subjects were asked to refrain from eating anything more
until 4 h from the beginning of the test, i.e. at lunch
time, and to eat a similar lunch, if any, during the two
study periods. Breath hydrogen was evaluated as a mar-
ker of colonic fermentation.
Patients
were
allowed
to
use
OTC-dimeticone
(Cuplaton; Orion Oy, Espoo, Finland) as a rescue medi-
cation if their symptoms required relief. Dimeticone was
provided free-of-charge to the subjects and its purpose
was to reduce the likelihood of premature withdrawals
from the study.
The timing of the different measurements is depicted
in Table S1.
Statistical analysis
The overall IBS-SSS score was the primary outcome vari-
able and the weekly IBS symptoms, the weekly symptom
scores and the IBS-QOL score were the secondary out-
come variables. The sample size calculation for the pre-
sent study was based on the primary variable IBS-SSS.
Suitable previously published data were not available to
be used in calculations. Thus, we assumed that the dif-
ference between study breads would be at least 50 points
on the 500-point IBS-SSS score and that the standard
deviation of that difference would be 150 points. In that
case, a sample size of 73 would have 80% power to
detect this 50 point difference of using a paired t-test
with a 0.05 two-sided significance level. The anticipated
drop out was 15–20% and therefore 84–88 patients were
targeted for this cross-over study.
The patient characteristics are expressed as mean
(range) for continuous variables and as number of
patients (%) for categorical variables. The primary and
the secondary outcome variables were analysed using the
repeated measures
ANOVA for cross-over design. The
effects of treatment (low-FODMAP rye bread vs. regular
rye bread), the time effect and the carry-over effect were
tested and the differences between study breads are
expressed as mean (95% CI).
Area under curve estimates of breath hydrogen test
were calculated using the absolute breath hydrogen val-
ues (AUC0–360 min). The trapezium rule was applied for
AUC calculations. The number of slices of study breads
was assessed at week 1 and during weeks 2–4. The
weight of patients was inquired at the baseline and after
both study periods. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test was
used with respect to breath hydrogen level and the num-
ber of consumed slices of study breads and paired sam-
ples t-test was used to compare weight between the low-
FODMAP
rye
bread
vs.
regular
rye
bread.

Randomised clinical trial: low FODMAPs and irritable bowel syndrome
 Friedman’s two-way ANOVA was used to compare dietary
intake during the study periods. Pairwise comparisons
between study periods were conducted only if the global
test was significant. A P ≤ 0.05 was considered statisti-
cally significant. The statistical analysis was performed
using IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows (versions 22.0
and 23.0; IBM Corp, Armonk, NY, USA).
RESULTS
A total of 87 patients with IBS were recruited for the
study. Seven patients withdrew from the study during
the run-in period. Of remaining 80 patients, three
patients withdrew during the first period and four during
the wash out period. One patient withdrew from the trial
when consuming the low-FODMAP rye bread and two
patients during regular rye bread. The reasons for dis-
continuation are detailed in Table 2; Figure 1 depicts the
flow chart for the study.
The
majority
of
patients
were
females
(91.3%).
Patients had a mean age of 42.9 (range 21–64) years and
median body mass index of 23.4 (range 17.3–36.6) kg/
m2. The median consumption of any bread daily at base-
line was 3.0 slices (approximately 84.1 g/day) and 62.5%
of patients reported the regular use of rye bread. See
Table 3 for details. Mean IBS-SSS score was 228 (range
80–430) at baseline. Most patients (62.5%) had mixed
type of IBS, 32.5% had diarrhoea predominant IBS and
5% had unspecified symptoms.
There was no significant difference in IBS-SSS values
between the study breads. The estimated mean was 199
(95% CI 179–220) during the low-FODMAP rye bread
vs. 207 (187–227) during the regular rye bread. The dif-
ference between breads was �8 (95% CI �27–11),
P = 0.40, see Figure 2.
No significant difference was detected between the
study breads in the assessment of quality of life. The
mean (95% CI) was 29.2 (25.0–33.5) during the low-FOD-
MAP rye bread vs. 30.0 (25.5–34.5) during the regular rye
bread. The difference was �0.8 (�2.9–1.3), P = 0.45.
Weekly VAS measurements of individual symptoms
revealed statistically significant differences between the
breads when the mean values of weeks 1, 2, 3 and 4
were analysed (Table 4). Flatulence, abdominal pain,
cramps and stomach rumbling were milder when the
subjects
were
eating
the
low-FODMAP
rye
bread
(P-values: 0.04; 0.049; 0.01 and 0.001 respectively). There
was also a significant difference between the breads in
the total symptom score, i.e. in the mean of all 10 symp-
toms, 30 (95% CI 27–30) during the low-FODMAP rye
bread vs. 33 (95% CI 30–37) during the regular rye
bread. The mean difference was �3 (�6 to �1),
P = 0.02) favouring low-FODMAP rye bread. A carry-
over effect was observed with respect to cramps but not
in any of the other symptoms. A time-dependent effect
was observed in dyspepsia.
The breath hydrogen level was significantly lower dur-
ing the low-FODMAP rye bread as compared to the reg-
ular rye bread. The median (inter-quartile range) AUC
was 52.9 (32.4–76.8) ppm during low-FODMAP rye
bread vs. 72.6 (46.7–114.9) ppm during the regular rye
bread (P = 0.01, Wilcoxon signed-rank test). The results
are illustrated in Figure 3. Only subjects for whom we
had complete breath hydrogen measurements during
both study breads are included (n = 60).
The weight of the patients differed significantly after
the treatments. The mean difference was �0.5 kg (95%
CI �0.9 to �0.0, P = 0.03, t-test for paired samples).
After the low-FODMAP rye bread period, the patients’
mean weight was 70.6 kg; it was slightly more after the
regular rye bread period, 71.1 kg.
Dietary intakes are reported in Table 5. The median
intake
of
energy
was
8103 kJ/day
during
baseline,
7994 kJ/day
during
low-FODMAP
rye
bread
and
7873 kJ/day during regular rye bread. There were no sta-
tistically significant differences in energy intake between
the periods. Furthermore, there were no statistically sig-
nificant differences in the intake of carbohydrates, pro-
tein or fat between the three periods. Fibre intake

 increased by 6 g/day during the low-FODMAP rye bread
period and by 8 g/day during the regular rye bread per-
iod as compared to the baseline period (P < 0.001 for
both vs. baseline), but there were no statistically signifi-
cant differences between the two treatment periods
(P = 0.09).
Median intake of FODMAPs from low-FODMAP
bread was 0.42 g/day and regular rye bread 1.47 g/day
during the first week of the study (P < 0.001) and during
the study weeks 2–4, it was 0.60 g/day and 2.21 g/day
(P < 0.001) respectively. Table 6 details the intake of
mannitol, fructans and total FODMAPs during the
study.
Patients reported that they were consuming three
slices of bread daily during the run-in period. There
were no differences in the number of slices of study
breads consumed during week 1 and during weeks 2–4
between low-FODMAP rye bread vs. regular rye bread
(medians were 3.5 vs. 3.5, P = 0.68 at week 1 and 5.0 vs.
5.3 at weeks 2–4, P = 0.91).
DISCUSSION
As far as we are aware, this is the first randomised study
to investigate the exclusive effect of bread in-patients
with the irritable bowel syndrome. We were interested in
rye bread because it seems to induce long satiety (second

 meal effect), offer special benefits in terms of glucose
and insulin metabolism, has high-fibre content and many
micronutrients, but on the other hand, is considered as a
high-FODMAP grain.8, 11, 12 The key finding of the
study is that the modification of FODMAP content of
bread alone does have an observable effect on the symp-
toms of IBS. Low-FODMAP rye bread caused evidently
less
symptoms
as
there
was
statistically
significant
difference in abdominal pain, flatulence, stomach rum-
bling, intestinal cramps as well as in the total score of
symptoms measured by weekly VAS, favouring the low-
FODMAP rye bread. All of these symptoms can be con-
sidered as typically associated with the colonic fermenta-
tion of FODMAPs. No differences were observed in
other individual symptoms that are more likely linked to
the stomach and rectum sections of the digestive system
(heartburn, dyspepsia, diarrhoea, constipation, incom-
plete defecation, urgency in defecation). These findings
in individual symptoms are in line with the observed dif-
ference in breath hydrogen excretion, i.e. less hydrogen
was excreted during the low-FODMAP rye bread period
confirming the lower level fermentation of FODMAPs in
colon and reduced gas accumulation. These results also
suggest that modifying the FODMAP content of just one
regularly consumed food item may have significant
effects on certain symptoms of IBS.
Rye bread is an important source of dietary fibre in
Finland. The fibre composition of rye bread is complex
as it contains both soluble and insoluble fibre. Moreover,
it has different types of fibre components; of these, arabi-
noxylan is the most prominent followed by fructan. In
this study, both of the study breads had high-fibre con-
tent. The main difference between the breads was the
fructan content; the regular rye bread contained more
than three times the amount of fructan than the low-
FODMAP rye bread.
We detected a substantial increase in dietary fibre
intake during both treatment periods. In fact, the fibre
intake at baseline was at the same level as in general
female population of this age in Finland (22 g in our
study vs. 21 g in FinnDiet 2012 study).9 During the low-

 FODMAP rye bread period, the intake of fibre was 27 g
slightly less than the 29 g during the regular rye bread
period (P = 0.09).
Despite the results in individual symptoms, we did
not observe any effect in IBS-SSS, which was our pri-
mary end point. To the best of our knowledge, IBS-SSS
has been used only once in a randomised IBS study on
FODMAPs.20 In a 6-week trial, IBS-SSS symptom scores
were significantly lower when patients consumed a holis-
tic low-FODMAP diet compared to the situation when
they adhered to their usual diet. In our study, the intake
of FODMAPs (mannitol and fructans) from the study
breads differed on average by 1.5 g/day, of which 1.2 g
was fructans. In comparison, the low-FODMAP cut-off
value used by the research team at Monash University
for oligosaccharides [total fructans plus galacto-oligosac-
charides (GOS)] from core grain/cereal/nut/seed prod-
ucts
is
0.3 g
per
sitting
(Jane

personal
communication). On the other hand, when a holistic
low-FODMAP diet is prescribed, the intake of all FOD-
MAPs seems to be substantially reduced, by 12–40 g/day
from the level of 30–50 g/day.21, 22 Hence, the overall
daily reduction in FODMAPs in our study was probably
too small to induce major differences in IBS-SSS. This

Randomised clinical trial: low FODMAPs and irritable bowel syndrome
 explanation is also likely to apply to quality of life, where
similarly we could detect no difference between the two
bread periods.
The fact that we found a difference in gas accumula-
tion, and individual symptoms as well as in total score
of symptoms measured by weekly VAS but not with
IBS-SSS (twice per treatment period) might also be
explained by the differences between assessment tests.
IBS-SSS is an instrument driven by pain and overall sat-
isfaction with bowel function; it does not measure indi-
vidual symptoms other than bloating and abdominal
pain. Our total score of VAS symptoms consisted of 10
different symptoms of which only one (abdominal pain)
was included in the IBS-SSS. Measurements of individual
symptoms and their composite end point may be more
sensitive to changes than IBS-SSS, which reflects more
overall satisfaction and pain during the last 10 days. In
fact, measurements of individual symptoms seem to be
more frequently used in low-FODMAP diet studies than
IBS-SSS measurements.7 Moreover, gas accumulation,
measured as bread hydrogen concentration, is an objec-
tive way to measure the extent of colon fermentation.
We did not include predominantly constipated IBS
(IBS-C) patients into our study. We thought initially that
IBS-C patients would respond positively to both breads
in terms of bowel movements, leading to reduced consti-
pation and thus improved well-being. Indeed, in a direct
comparison of rye and white wheat bread, the consump-
tion of rye bread achieved increased bowel movements,
eased defecation and reduced intestinal transit time in
healthy subjects.23 For this reason, we thought that this
might introduce heterogeneity in the response and a sub-
sequent dilution of the overall effect in the whole study
population. In retrospect, the exclusion of IBS-C was
probably unnecessary, because we found no effect on
constipation; similarly in other studies, the effect of grain
bran on IBS-related constipation has been modest.24–26
The major strength of this study is its double-blinded
randomised setting. All the participants, the principal
investigator, the patient contact subject and the statisti-
cian were blinded. Keeping patients and contact persons
blinded remains a major challenge in dietary IBS studies.
In fact, a recent systematic review showed that the most
low-FODMAP diet studies scored poorly on blinding.27
This study is one of the rare blinded studies on FOD-
MAP concept, thus further confirming the role of the
FODMAP approach in IBS.
We included all the available participants into the
analyses, whether they were low users of bread or fully
compliant. Most participants were not able to consume
the seven to eight slices of bread as instructed and rec-
ommended in Finnish dietary guidelines, and some par-
ticipants consumed very low amounts (0–2 slices daily)
throughout the study. Therefore, the results presented
here are intention-to-treat analyses that usually are con-
sidered more robust than per protocol analyses.
However, our study has some limitations. It may not
be possible to generalise the study results to patients
with IBS-C or to patients who are subjectively strictly
intolerant to rye or other grains as we excluded these
individuals
from
the
study.
One
distinct
difference
between our study and many other FODMAP studies is
that we did not control the background diet, i.e. the par-
ticipants were not asked to adhere to a holistic FOD-
MAP restricted diet. Nonetheless, we argue that the lack
of strict FODMAP restriction is actually more likely to
cause regression to mean in our study. Therefore, the
design of the study might cause dilution of the actual

 effects of low-FODMAP rye bread rather than exacerba-
tion of the difference in symptoms.
We asked the patients to keep their diet as constant
as possible and to avoid from any elimination diets
during the study. We think that the design of our
study allowed us to model a realistic and natural set-
ting. Furthermore, we have examined a scenario where
a patient would substitute one common food item in
his/her shopping basket for another similar product,
only differing in its FODMAP content. This is a much
more patient-friendly option than a complete change in
diet. Participants kept food diaries, but as there is no
database in Finland on the FODMAP content of foods,
especially data on fructans and polyols is lacking, we
were not able to calculate the total amount of FOD-
MAPs consumed during the periods. Some participants
may have either reduced or increased the intake of
other FODMAPs accidently or purposefully during the
study despite instructions to adhere to their normal
diet.
We did not analyse the amount of GOS in the study
breads. However, we performed a post hoc analysis on a
commercial sourdough rye bread which is very similar to
our regular rye bread (our control). Its raffinose content
was 0.03%. There is no reason to believe that the fer-
mentation process used by us caused increase in the
amount of GOS in the low-FODMAP rye bread when
compared to this commercial rye bread. It is unlikely
that differences in the amount of GOS in the study
breads could have had a significant effect on the study
outcomes.
Prevalence of colon cancer is increasing in many
countries. According to World Cancer Research Fund’s
meta-analyses (2010), both the low intake of cereal fibre
and the high intake of processed and red meat are risk
factors for colorectal cancer.28 It is postulated that one
of the key mechanisms how red and processed meat is
associated with the risk of colorectal cancer is the fer-
mentation of unabsorbed protein in colon, especially
when concomitant dietary fibre is lacking.29 In this con-
text, low-FODMAP rye bread could provide a means to
increase fibre intake and thereby to reduce colonic fer-
mentation
of
unabsorbed
protein
also
among
IBS
patients. However, a possible decrease in protein fermen-
tation during a diet containing plenty of low-FODMAP
rye bread needs to be confirmed and addressed in speci-
fic clinical trials.
In conclusion, this study showed that the low-FOD-
MAP rye bread caused less fermentation in colon, less
flatulence, less abdominal pain, less cramps and less
stomach rumbling than regular rye bread. The low-FOD-
MAP rye bread was well accepted by study patients.
Moreover, the low-FODMAP rye bread was a feasible
way to increase dietary fibre intake to the recommended
level in IBS patients. Since it was the sole change in diet,
simply switching from regular rye bread to low-FOD-
MAP bread is not likely to be sufficient for most patients
to achieve clinically relevant reductions of symptoms, as
suggested by our measurements with IBS-SSS and quality
of life. Nonetheless, the present study reveals that low-
FODMAP rye bread is feasible and palatable bread for
IBS patients who want to follow a healthy, fibre-rich
low-FODMAP diet. More randomised studies will be
needed to clarify the effects of FODMAPs in wholegrain
foods, especially rye-based products and as contributory
factors in IBS.
