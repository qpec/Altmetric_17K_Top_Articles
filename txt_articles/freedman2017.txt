Abstract 
Because of the wide range of symptoms expressed in individuals with Autism Spectrum 
Disorder (ASD) and their idiosyncratic severity it is unlikely that a single remedial approach will be 
universally effective. Resolution of this dilemma requires identifying subgroups within the autism 
spectrum, based on symptom set and severity, on an underlying neuro-structural difference, and 
on specific behavioral dysfunction. This will provide critical insight into the disorder and may lead 
to better diagnoses, and more targeted remediation in these subphenotypes of people with ASD. 
In this review we discuss findings that appear to link the structure of the cerebellar vermis 
and plasticity of the saccadic eye movement system in people with an Autism Spectrum Disorder 
(ASD). Differences in cerebellar vermis structure in ASD could critically impact visuo-sensori-motor 
development in early infancy, which may in turn manifest as the visual orienting, communication 
and social interaction differences often seen in this population. It may be possible to distinguish a 
subpopulation of children with vermal hypoplasia, to establish whether this group manifests more 
severe deficits in visual orienting and in adaptation to persistent visual errors, and to establish 
whether this putative subphenotype of ASD is associated with a specific and distinct clinical 
symptom profile.

Eye Movements 
Eye movements and the neural mechanisms that control them have been a major 
component of neuroscience research for many decades.  There are several benefits of studying eye 
movements if one is interested in uncovering the ways in which sensory information is processed to 
produce rapid, coordinated behaviors that are essential for everyday tasks. The rapid eye 
movements made when we look from one object to another, known as saccades, are an integral 
component mediating our interactions with both animate and inanimate objects; they are crucial for 
navigating, and also for orienting visual attention to spatial locations containing pertinent 
information. Saccades are defined by their characteristic rapidity, precision, and accuracy. But 
precision and accuracy must be maintained in the face of changes in the mechanical properties of 
the eyes caused by growth and aging, fatigue of the musculature and degeneration of neurons that 
contribute to eye movement control.   
The core knowledge of the neural mechanisms that produce eye movements has been 
translated to the neurology clinic in several ways.  The most prevalent is the assessment of function 
during a standard neurological exam in which patients track moving objects, look from one location 
to another and fixate stationary objects.  Simple observation of these movements can demonstrate 
intact performance of three pairs of cranial nerves, the associated motor neuron pools, the pontine 
premotor regions, and to some extent the vestibular apparatus. When these neural mechanisms fail, 
due to damage or disease or developmental disorder, the resultant changes in eye movements can 
suggest specific computational errors that may be responsible, and highlight brain regions where 
these computations are thought to occur. Conversely, pathological differences in brain structural 
integrity may implicate specific eye-movement deficits that could in turn lead to informed 
hypotheses about potential underlying neuro-computational disorganization. 
Plasticity of saccades  
Movements planned and executed through the concerted actions of neuromuscular systems 
do not always produce the intended results. Simply put, sometimes executed eye movements will 
over- or under-shoot the intended target locations.  If such errors persist, the nervous system will 
attempt to adjust the motor output to reduce or eliminate discrepancies between desired and 
actual outcomes (this adjustment of motor output resulting from detection of sensory errors is 
known as sensorimotor adaptation).  Dysfunction of the cerebellum can result in a failure to 
perceive errors or an inability to modulate motor commands and can have drastic behavioral 
consequences (disorientation, incoordination, ataxia, etc.)(Horak et al., 1989; Bastian et al., 1996; 
Martin et al., 1996; Takagi et al., 1998; Baker et al., 1999; Barash et al., 1999; Deuschl et al., 2000; 
Schmahmann, 2004). 
 
Adaptation of the amplitude of saccadic eye movements has often been investigated by 
experimentally introducing a visual error at the end of saccades (McLaughlin, 1967; Miller et al., 
1981; Deubel et al., 1986; Frens & Opstal, 1997; Phillips et al., 1997; Straube et al., 1997; Scudder et 
al., 1998; Wallman & Fuchs, 1998; Noto et al., 1999; Hopp & Fuchs, 2002; Robinson et al., 2003; 
Alahyane & Pelisson, 2004; 2005; Takeichi et al., 2005; Hopp & Fuchs, 2006; Takeichi et al., 2007; 
Cecala & Freedman, 2008; Ethier et al., 2008; Cecala & Freedman, 2009). This surreptitious 
introduction of visual error is accomplished using some variant of the task first introduced by 
McLaughlin (McLaughlin, 1967). Subjects start by fixating a visual target, generally in a central

location and often referred to as the ‘zero’ target or T0. After this initial fixation, a second target (T1) 
is presented and subjects are instructed to look at this location as quickly and accurately as they can. 
After some baseline trials to determine how each subject performs this basic saccade task, 
adaptation trials begin. During these trials, when a subject initiates a saccadic eye movement to look 
to the T1 location, the target is turned off. A second target light (T2) is turned on, either at the same 
time that T1 is turned off or after a very brief delay. The T2 target can be either in between the T0 
and T1 locations, or it can be beyond the T1 location. The first case simulates a large overshoot of 
the T1 location since the visual error after the initial saccade is back along the route that the eyes 
just followed.  After a delay subjects typically make a second saccade (known as a corrective 
movement) to look at the T2 location. After repeated trials of this sort, the amplitude of saccades to 
the T1 target get progressively smaller (gain-down adaptation) thereby reducing the perceived visual 
error at the end of the primary movement. During adaptation trials in which the T2 target is 
positioned beyond the T1 position, the visual error at the end of the primary saccade is in the same 
direction as the just completed eye movement, as if the primary saccade fell short of the intended 
target.  Over the course of repeated trials of this type, the amplitude of primary saccades to T1 will 
increase (gain-up adaptation), reducing the residual visual error (McLaughlin, 1967; Straube et al., 
1997; Noto et al., 1999; Hopp & Fuchs, 2004; Panouilleres et al., 2009; Schnier & Lappe, 2011). 
During saccadic adaptation, the motor output is altered despite unaltered sensory input; the 
location of the visual target that triggers the initial saccade (T1) is constant throughout adaptation, 
yet the amplitude of the movement to this target changes. This suggests that adaptation alters the 
transformation of sensory signals into motor commands.  
A great deal of research makes it clear that the cerebellum is a key mediator of sensorimotor 
adaptation (Thach et al., 1992; Barash et al., 1999; Takeichi et al., 2005; Fuchs & Soetedjo, 2006; 
Golla et al., 2008; Donchin et al., 2012; Block & Celnik, 2013; Panouilleres et al., 2015). During 
saccadic adaptation, Purkinje cells in vermis lobules VI and VII and the deep cerebellar nucleus that 
they project to (caudal fastigial nucleus) are critical (Soetedjo et al., 2008; Herzfeld et al., 2015)   For 
instance, there is a neuro-degenerative disorder in humans known as spinocerebellar ataxia type 6 
(SCA-6) that results in the death of cerebellar Purkinje cells (Koeppen, 2005; Xu-Wilson et al., 2009). 
Since P-cells are the output neurons of the cerebellar cortex, the function of the cerebellum is 
drastically altered in SCA-6. In these people,  sensorimotor adaptation of saccade amplitude is 
significantly reduced compared to people without this disorder (Golla et al., 2008; Xu-Wilson et al., 
2009). Other types of cerebellar lesion have also been shown to result in impaired saccade 
adaptation (Waespe & Baumgartner, 1992; Straube et al., 2001; Golla et al., 2008)). In non-human 
primates transient inactivation of the oculomotor cerebellum leads to dysmetric saccades (loss of 
accuracy) as well as increased variability in endpoint control (loss of precision) (Robinson et al., 
1993; Takagi et al., 1998; Takagi et al., 2003; Quinet & Goffart, 2005; Guerrasio et al., 2010; Kojima 
et al., 2011). Direct stimulation of the posterior cerebellum using transcranial direct current 
techniques can increase cerebellar activity (Galea et al., 2011; Schlerf et al., 2012) which leads to 
more rapid sensorimotor adaptation (Jayaram et al., 2012; Block & Celnik, 2013; Cantarero et al., 
2015) and can also enhance the rate of motor learning (Cantarero et al., 2013a; Cantarero et al., 
2013b). Repetitive trans-cranial stimulation of the posterior cerebellum in humans has been shown 
to disrupt saccadic adaptation and the disruption is correlated with the magnitude of the stimulation 
(Jenkinson & Miall, 2010).

There is a growing consensus that the cerebellum plays a critical role in motor learning of a 
variety of types including adaptation in of the vestibulo-ocular reflex (Belton & McCrea, 2000), 
eye-blink conditioning (Nagao et al., 1984; Evinger & Manning, 1988), arm movements (Gilbert & 
Thach, 1977; Thach et al., 1992; Martin et al., 1996; Miall et al., 1998; Norris et al., 2004), pursuit 
eye movements (Ohtsuka & Enoki, 1998)  and saccadic eye movements (see citations above and 
these reviews (Pelisson et al., 2010; Shadmehr et al., 2010)). The seminal work of Marr (Marr, 
1969) and Albus (Albus, 1971) suggested that motor learning is based on the output of Purkinje 
cells (P-cells) residing the cerebellar cortex, and in the case of saccades in the oculomotor vermis 
(Kase et al., 1980; Noda & Fujikado, 1987a; b). Purkinje cells have two different action potential 
waveforms. Simple spikes are produced by inputs from mossy fibers and activate P-cells via the 
parallel fiber network synapsing on the P-cell dendrites. In contrast complex spikes are driven 
solely by climbing fiber inputs that originate in the Inferior Olive (IO). There continues to be 
discussion of the exact nature of the IO input, with some studies indicating that it provides a 
corrective error signal (Fuchs & Soetedjo, 2006; Soetedjo et al., 2008; Herzfeld et al., 2015) and 
others suggesting that it reinforces newly learned behaviors (Catz et al., 2005). Theoretical 
frameworks that include cerebellar function generally involve some use of a comparison of 
expected results of movements (based on the self-generated motor commands) and actual results 
based on inflow of information from the senses ((Bell, 1982; Miall et al., 1993; Wolpert et al., 
1995; Miall & Wolpert, 1996; Bell et al., 1997; Blakemore et al., 1998; Baddeley et al., 2003; Miall 
et al., 2007; Tian et al., 2009; Shadmehr et al., 2010), and see  (von Holst & Mittelstaedt, 1971) for 
an early description of this concept). Detailed review of these models is beyond the scope of the 
current review, but what is clear from both the experimental and theoretical work is that in order 
to generate precise, accurate saccadic eye movements and to adjust their amplitude as a result of 
imposed visual errors normal function of the Purkinje cells in the cerebellar vermis lobes VI-VII, 
and neurons the fastigial nucleus are paramount. Disordered activity leads to loss of accuracy, 
precision and dynamic modification. 
Development of cerebellum in autism 
Several studies have demonstrated a reduction in the size (hypoplasia) of the cerebellar 
vermis in subjects with an ASD (Gaffney et al., 1987; Courchesne et al., 1988; Bauman, 1991; 
Hashimoto et al., 1993; Hashimoto et al., 1995; Bauman & Kemper, 2005) and lobes VI and VII 
appear to be particularly altered compared to neurotypical subjects (Courchesne et al., 1988; 
Courchesne et al., 1994b)). However, findings are not always consistent, and other studies have 
suggested no hypoplasia of the vermis in ASD (Holttum et al., 1992; Kleiman et al., 1992; Manes et 
al., 1999; Scott et al., 2009).  A meta-analysis  (Stanfield et al., 2008) did find evidence supporting 
the notion that lobes VI and VII as well as lobes I-V of the vermis are reduced in ASD.  There is also 
some evidence that the structure of the cerebellum at the cellular level may also be altered in 
people with autism. For instance, reduced density of P-cells and granular cells in both the cerebellar 
hemispheres and vermis have been observed in ASD (Bauman, 1991; Bailey et al., 1998; Kemper & 
Bauman, 2002), but based on these postmortem analyses, this appears to be the case in only about 
50% of autism cases. In a careful study of both the volume and area of the cerebellum in three sub-
groups of ASD individuals (low-functioning autism - LFA, high-functioning autism -HFA and 
Asperger’s Syndrome –ASP), Scott and colleagues  (Scott et al., 2009) did report vermal hypoplasia in 
ASD compared to TD control subjects (although no differences in area were observed). Interestingly,

and perhaps surprisingly, the difference in vermis volume was found to be due to a marked 
hypoplasia in the HFA group. No significant hypoplasia was observed in either the LFA or ASP groups. 
After birth, the size of the cerebellum and brainstem increases as infants develop in both 
ASD and control groups  (Hashimoto et al., 1995). This pattern of development suggests that the 
differences in vermal size in autism are not due to progressive degeneration and that after birth 
development is not different than TDs (Hashimoto et al., 1995) . Rather it suggests that 
neocerebellar hypoplasia in autism might be a result of granular and P-cell loss as early as the 3rd to 
5th months prenatally (Courchesne et al., 1988). 
There is some evidence that there are two subphenotypes of people with autism – one 
group  with hypo- and one hyper-plasia of the cerebellar vermal region (Courchesne et al., 1994a; 
Courchesne et al., 1994b). This may account for earlier data that seemed to contravene the 
hypothesis that the cerebellum is affected in ASD subjects. Although a strong link between  
cerebellar volumes and ASD  is still an open question. Multiple different cerebellar subphenotypes 
may also be responsible in part for the recent analysis of the ABIDE cohort that identified no 
relationship between cerebellar volume and ASD (Traut et al., 2017). 
Altered cerebellar activity in autism 
As indicated above, the structure of the cerebellum, and particularly the midline posterior 
cerebellum (vermis lobes VI-VIII) that is known to be involved in eye movement control, is altered in 
at least a subpopulation of people with autism. In addition the neural activity of the cerebellum has 
been shown to be different in people with autism compared to neurotypical subjects. For example, 
Mostofsky and colleagues  (Mostofsky et al., 2009) report a reduced activation of the ipsilateral 
cerebellum in children with ASD during an appositional finger-tapping task. In addition, they report a 
diffuse reduction in connectivity across the cerebral-cerebellar motor network consistent with 
difficulty in shifting motor control from cortex to regions associated with learned performance.  
Using a different type of task (button press in a go-nogo paradigm) Allen and colleagues (Allen et al., 
2004) report an increase in ipsilateral anterior cerebellar activity in 8 ASD subjects compared to age-
matched TDs. They also report atypical activation in other cerebellar regions in this group of 
subjects. In their study, increased activation of the anterior cerebellum was correlated with the 
degree of structural abnormality (Allen et al., 2004).  
Saccades in autism 
There is considerable variability in the data with respect to saccades in ASD. But some 
experiments, with relatively large sample sizes, do seem to show some consistent deficits. One of 
the most recent studies to address this issue reported reduced accuracy, increased trial-to-trial 
variability, prolonged acceleration phase and duration, and reduced peak velocity (Schmitt et al., 
2014), but no effects on latency were reported. Stanley-Cary et al. (Stanley-Cary et al., 2011) also 
reported increased variability in saccade endpoints and increased kinematic variability in ASD. In the 
Stanley-Cary study, saccades were slower overall and peak velocities varied so the main sequence 
relationship was not nearly as systematic in ASD subjects compared to TDs. Stanley-Cary and 
colleagues also compared their ASD subjects with Aspberger’s Syndrome subjects, and saw no 
change in saccade kinematics in Aspberger’s subjects compared to TDs, but clear differences in their 
ASD subject pool. They concluded that the deficits they saw in ASD subjects were consistent with

deficits in cerebellar function. Johnson and colleagues (Johnson et al., 2012) also demonstrated 
inaccurate saccades and hypometricity in saccade endpoints.  
Adaptation in autism 
Given the hypoplasia of the cerebellar vermis (Courchesne, 1991; Courchesne et al., 1994a) 
and fastigial nuclei (Bauman, 1991) in ASD, it is reasonable to look for deficits in behaviors strongly 
associated with normal functioning of these regions. Rapid alteration of saccade amplitude in 
response to persistent (experimentally induced) visual errors is dependent on intact function of the 
vermis and fastigial nuclei and so this type of sensory-motor adaptation is a good candidate as a 
metric of cerebellar dysfunction in ASD or in other developmental disorders. Two relatively recent 
reports address this directly.  Using the McLaughlin task (McLaughlin, 1967), Johnson and colleagues 
(Johnson et al., 2013) show a difference in rate of adaptation in subjects with high functioning 
autism, compared to those with Asperger’s disorder and typically developing subjects. They also 
highlight a small change in velocity during adaptation in the TDs but not in the HFA or AD groups. In 
a second study (Mosconi et al., 2013), 56 ASD subjects were compared to 53 age-matched controls 
in a similar saccade adaptation paradigm. These authors also suggest that the rates of adaptation in 
ASD subjects were slower than in TDs, and importantly point out that ~30% of participants with 
ASD failed to adapt the amplitude of saccades (Mosconi et al., 2013). We have some preliminary 
data on saccade adaptation in children with ASD and age-matched typically developing subjects. 
Below is an example of the differences we have seen (Fig. 1).  On the left is an example of saccade 
amplitude adaptation in a TD subject. After making a series of saccades to target location (left of the 
vertical line) adaptation trials are started. Over the course of ~30 adaptation trials saccade 
amplitude systematically declines, reducing the imposed visual error. On the right are the results of 
a similar session with an ASD subject. Here the control movements are significantly hypometric and 
the endpoint variability is higher than in the TD subject. After adaptation trials begin there is little or 
no change in saccade amplitude over the 70 adaption trials presented. Endpoint variability during 
adaptation in this subject is also high. Although preliminary, these results are consistent with those 
mentioned above and also consistent with the general hypothesis that altered cerebellar activity in 
ASD might lead to a failure of normal sensorimotor adaptation.  
While previous studies and our preliminary data suggest deficits in saccade adaptation in at least a 
subset of people with ASD, more study is clearly needed. For example, two of the commonly 
reported deficits in saccadic eye movements made by people with an ASD are that saccades tend to 
be hypometric (i.e. they fall short of the target) and that saccade endpoints are highly variable 
(Takarae et al., 2004; Nowinski et al., 2005; Mosconi et al., 2010; Schmitt et al., 2014). As 
mentioned above this finding is consistent with non-human primate studies that disturb the 
normal function of the cerebellar vermis (Takagi et al., 1998; Quinet & Goffart, 2005; Jenkinson & 
Miall, 2010). Both of these differences in saccades will reduce the likelihood of observing gain-down 
saccadic adaptation. It remains possible that people with ASD can in fact adapt saccade amplitudes 
in response to persistent visual errors but that this ability has been masked by the hypometry and 
variability of their saccades. Particularly in light of the study by Golla and colleagues (Golla et al., 
2008) that suggests cerebellar degeneration (and in particular lesions affecting the cerebellar 
vermis) can lead to a loss of the ability to increase saccade amplitude during adaptation, with less 
impact on gain decreases in amplitude. To our knowledge, there have been no systematic studies of 
adaptation to increase saccade size in a population with ASD. It will also be important to evaluate

the ability to adapt saccades and correlate this behavioral assay with measures of cerebellar 
hypoplasia and link these with the symptom type and severity in ASD.  Recent reports of saccade 
adaptation in infants as young as 10 months old (Alahyane et al., 2016; Lemoine-Lardennois et al., 
2016) are intriguing as they might prove useful in predicting a future diagnosis of ASD. If this were 
the case, early remedial efforts could be targeted at this subgroup of young children and perhaps 
improve outcomes. 
Potential implications of saccadic imprecision for the development of visual functioning 
 
An intriguing developmental question arises when one considers that a subset of individuals 
with an ASD might suffer from persistently inaccurate saccades and poorer adaptation processes.  
The retinotopic maps of the visual cortex clearly develop over the course of infancy and early 
childhood, and it seems a reasonable proposition that the titration of these spatial maps would be 
affected by the fidelity and precision of the eye-movement system. Indeed, this would necessarily be 
an iterative process, with tuning of the cortical spatial maps being dependent on ever-more accurate 
eye-movements, and the resultant increase in finer-grained maps leading to ever-more precise 
saccades, until presumably the system reaches optimal spatial tuning.  The obvious question then is 
what would be the impact of greater intrinsic error or variability in the saccadic system.  One 
prediction would be that cortical magnification factors, a hallmark of early visual cortical retinotopic 
maps, might be expected to be less well calibrated, and that spatial receptive fields might be 
somewhat enlarged. In a recent study, our group used high-density visual evoked potentials (VEPs) 
to show that there was increased representation of more peripheral extra-foveal space in a cohort of 
ASD children (Frey et al., 2013).  We interpreted this as preliminary evidence for a reduction/shift in 
the cortical magnification factor and speculated that this was due to the effects of less accurate 
saccades during development. However, it must be pointed out that we did not measure saccade 
accuracy or adaptation in those children, so this could not be directly addressed.  Functional 
neuroimaging work has also pointed to enlarged population receptive fields in extrastriate visual 
cortex, a finding that accords well with the saccadic imprecision thesis above (Schwarzkopf et al., 
2014)), although it should be pointed out that increased receptive field sizes were not detected in 
area V1. A clear next step will be to assess whether children who show the greatest deficits in 
saccade accuracy and adaptation are those who show the greatest anomalies in the titration of the 
early retinotopic maps in cortex. Of course, in turn, it will be of considerable interest to understand 
whether these deficits relate to any of the key phenotypes observed in ASD. 
If saccade adaptation deficits do turn out to be a consistent finding in a subgroup of children with an 
ASD, this raises the possibility that saccade adaptation measures may have utility as an early-
detection endophenotype. In this regard, the fact that very recent work has shown that saccadic 
adaptation can be successfully measured in children as young as 10-41 months of age (Alahyane et 
al., 2016; Lemoine-Lardennois et al., 2016) is a most encouraging development indeed.
