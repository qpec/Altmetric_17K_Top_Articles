The hippocampal CA3 region plays a key role in learning and memory. 
Recurrent CA3–CA3 synapses are thought to be the subcellular substrate of 
pattern completion. However, the synaptic mechanisms of this network 
computation remain enigmatic. To investigate these mechanisms, we 
combined 
functional 
connectivity 
analysis 
with 
network 
modeling. 
Simultaneous recording from up to eight CA3 pyramidal neurons revealed that 
connectivity was sparse, spatially uniform, and highly enriched in disynaptic 
motifs (reciprocal, convergence, divergence, and chain motifs). Unitary 
connections were comprised of one or two synaptic contacts, suggesting 
efficient use of postsynaptic space. Real-size modeling indicated that CA3 
networks with sparse connectivity, disynaptic motifs, and single-contact 
connections robustly generated pattern completion. Thus, macro- and 
microconnectivity contribute to efficient memory storage and retrieval in 
hippocampal networks.

The hippocampal CA3 region plays a key role in learning and memory (1–5). A 
hallmark property of the network is its ability to retrieve patterns from partial or noisy 
cues, a process referred to as autoassociative recall, attractor dynamics, or pattern 
completion (3–7). However, the synaptic mechanisms underlying pattern completion 
have remained enigmatic. Previous neuronal network models suggested that 
recurrent CA3–CA3 pyramidal cell synapses play a key role in this process (8–14). In 
the storage phase, a stimulus pattern will activate an ensemble of interconnected 
neurons and induce synaptic potentiation in the corresponding recurrent synapses. In 
the recall phase, a partial pattern will initially activate only a fraction of the ensemble, 
but subsequently recruit the remaining cells via potentiated synapses. Successful 
pattern completion requires sufficient synaptic efficacy and network connectivity (12, 
14). Whether the biological properties of the CA3 network are consistent with these 
assumptions remains unclear.  
 
Analysis of functional connectivity in the CA3 network  
The CA3 network is often envisaged as a network of highly interconnected neurons 
(3–5, 8, 11). To test this hypothesis, we analyzed functional connectivity by 
simultaneous recordings from up to eight CA3 pyramidal neurons in rat brain in vitro, 
followed by selective biocytin labeling (Fig. 1, A to D; fig. S1). In comparison to 
recording from sequential pairs, simultaneous recording from the same number of 
neurons allowed us to test a much larger number of potential synaptic connections 
(56 in an octuple configuration versus 8 in four sequential pairs; Fig. 1A). In total, we 
found 146 synaptic connections in 15,930 pairs tested (in 72 octuples, 66 septuples, 
118 sextuples, 120 quintuples, 135 quadruples, 96 triples, and 495 double 
recordings; 4,164 CA3 pyramidal neurons in 1,102 slices). The huge majority of 
interactions were chemical, as demonstrated by block by the AMPA-type glutamate 
receptor antagonist CNQX; evidence for electrical coupling was found in only 1 out of 
15,930 potential connections (fig. S2). Unitary excitatory postsynaptic potentials 
(EPSPs) had a mean latency of 2.3 ± 0.1 ms, a peak amplitude of 0.56 ± 0.01 mV, 
and a decay time constant of 80.1 ± 6.2 ms (40 connections; Fig. 1, E and F; table 
S1). Unitary excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) had a mean latency of 2.2 ± 
0.1 ms, a peak amplitude of 17.3 ± 2.0 pA, and a decay time constant of 9.5 ± 0.6 ms 
(39 connections; Fig. 1, G and H; table S1). These results confirm and extend 
previous results in guinea-pig slices (15, 16).

Macroconnectivity in the CA3 network  
Our results suggested that connectivity in the CA3 cell network was surprisingly 
sparse, with a mean connection probability of 0.92%. Both experimental data and 
simulations using fully reconstructed CA3 neurons labeled in vivo indicated that 
connectivity was only moderately dependent on slice orientation (materials and 
methods; fig. S3). However, connectivity may decline with distance (17). 
Furthermore, connectivity might be non-random, with ensembles of highly connected 
cells embedded in a sparsely connected population (18, 19). To test these 
hypotheses, we first examined whether the connection probability was dependent on 
intersomatic distance (Fig. 2A). The average connection probability did not 
significantly change with distance, for intersomatic distances of up to 400 µm (Fig. 
2A). Furthermore, both EPSP and EPSC peak amplitudes were not significantly 
dependent on distance (fig. S4, A and B).  
 
Next, we examined whether synaptic connectivity was random. To test this, 
we counted all disynaptic connectivity motifs (reciprocal connections, convergent 
triples, divergent triples, and disynaptic chains) in our experimental data set, and 
compared motif numbers to a simulated data set assuming random connectivity and 
a connection probability of 0.92% (i.e. the experimental value; Fig. 2, B and C). All 
disynaptic connectivity motifs occurred significantly more frequently than expected by 
chance. The frequency of reciprocal connections, convergent triples, divergent 
triples, and disynaptic chains was 6.5-fold, 2.9-fold, 6.3-fold, and 3.4-fold higher, 
respectively, than the corresponding chance level (Fig. 2C; P ≤ 0.002 in all cases). 
Furthermore, we found several superconnectivity motifs (7 connections in one 
octuple, 10 and 3 connections in two septuples, and 3 connections in two quintuples), 
which were highly unlikely in random networks (Fig. 2D). As connection probability 
was not significantly dependent on intersomatic distance (Fig. 2A), the 
overabundance of motifs was not an epiphenomenon of distance dependence. Thus, 
connectivity in the CA3 cell network was not random, but highly enriched in 
connectivity motifs (17–19), reminiscent of a small-world network architecture (20). 
Both connection probability and abundance of motifs were similar in the range of 
ages tested (fig. S4, C and D). Comparison of properties of connections embedded in 
disynaptic motifs with those of isolated connections revealed that the EPSC peak 
 5 
 
amplitude was smaller and the proportion of failures was higher for embedded 
connections, whereas kinetic parameters were not significantly different (fig. S4E). 
 
Microconnectivity of unitary CA3–CA3 connections  
Next, we analyzed the microconnectivity between pairs of synaptically connected 
neurons (Fig. 3). Functionally connected cells were completely reconstructed, and 
putative synaptic contacts between presynaptic axons and postsynaptic dendrites 
were identified light-microscopically (Fig. 3A). In hippocampal CA3–CA3 cell 
synapses, connections were formed by only one or two putative synaptic contacts. 
One putative contact per connection was observed in 58% of functionally connected 
cells (7 out of 12 connections), and two synaptic contacts were observed in the 
remaining 42% of cases (5 out of 12 connections; Fig. 3C). Synapses were formed at 
equal proportions on the hilar (proximal) and the fimbrial (distal) side of the 
presynaptic neuron, suggesting uniformity along the CA3a–c axis (70 and 70 out of 
140 connections; Fig. 3C). Putative synaptic contacts were located on basal 
dendrites in 53% of connections (9 out of 17 contacts) and on apical dendrites of 
postsynaptic target cells in the remaining 47% of cases (8 out of 17 contacts; Fig. 
3C). On average, the dendritic distance of the putative contacts from the center of the 
soma of the postsynaptic target cell was 141 ± 15 µm (12 reconstructed pairs; Fig. 
3D). Thus, in contrast to the neocortex (21–23), synaptically interconnected CA3 
pyramidal neurons showed only one or two morphological contacts per connection.  
 
To determine the number of functional release sites and the corresponding 
release probability, we recorded EPSPs and EPSCs in physiological extracellular 
solution containing 2 mM Ca2+, and in either reduced (1 mM) or elevated (4 mM) 
extracellular Ca2+ concentration (Fig. 3, E and F). The entire peak amplitude data set 
was fit with a binomial release model in which quantal size and number of functional 
release sites were assumed to be the same for the two conditions, whereas release 
probability was specified separately (see materials and methods). Multiple probability 
binomial analysis revealed that the mean number of functional release sites was 3.2 
± 0.8, and that the corresponding release probability with a physiological extracellular 
Ca2+ concentration was 0.37 ± 0.04 (15 connections total; Fig. 3, E and F; table S2). 
Thus, synaptic transmission at CA3–CA3 synapses was mediated by few functional 
release sites with a relatively high release probability (24, 25). Hence, in contrast to 
 6 
 
the neocortex (21–23, 26), hippocampal CA3 pyramidal cells often communicated 
with each other via a small number of functional release sites.  
 
Efficacy and summation of unitary synaptic events  
The sparse connectivity in the CA3 cell network raises the question of how few CA3 
pyramidal cells efficiently recruit their postsynaptic targets, as required for pattern 
completion. To address this question, we explored the properties of unitary 
postsynaptic conductance (Fig. 4). To estimate peak amplitude and time course of 
the postsynaptic conductance in the dendrite, we first determined the location of 
putative synaptic contacts in post-hoc labeled pairs. We then reconstructed the 
somatodendritic morphology of the postsynaptic CA3 pyramidal neuron and 
converted it into a detailed cable model (Fig. 4A). Finally, we simulated EPSCs, 
varying latency, rise time constant, peak amplitude, and decay time constant of the 
postsynaptic conductance until the best fit of the experimentally recorded average 
somatic EPSCs was obtained. Experimentally constrained modeling revealed a rise 
time constant of 0.26 ± 0.07 ms, a peak conductance of 0.54 ± 0.12 nS, and a decay 
time constant of 6.71 ± 1.46 ms (10 connections; Fig. 4, B and C). Considering the 
single-channel conductance of dendritic AMPARs in CA3 pyramidal neurons (10 pS) 
(27) and a mean number of 3.2 functional release sites (Fig. 3F), this peak 
conductance corresponded to 17 AMPARs per site open at the peak of an EPSC 
(28). Thus, a large number of postsynaptic AMPARs contributed to synaptic efficacy 
at recurrent CA3–CA3 synapses.  
 
Because a single unitary EPSP could not fire a postsynaptic CA3 cell (Fig. 1, 
E and F), we next examined the rules of temporal and spatial summation. To quantify 
temporal summation, we measured EPSPs evoked by repetitive stimulation of the 
presynaptic cell, using high-frequency trains of five or ten stimuli (Fig. 4D), which 
mimics burst activity of CA3 pyramidal cells in vivo (29). EPSPs showed substantial 
summation during repetitive stimulation. For 20-, 50-, and 100-Hz trains of five 
presynaptic action potentials, the ratio of EPSPmax / EPSP1 was 1.58 ± 0.28, 2.25 ± 
0.49, and 5.17 ± 2.50, respectively (3, 10, and 4 connections). Thus, for high-
frequency stimulation, temporal summation was nearly linear, with a maximal 
depolarization proportional to the number of spikes in the presynaptic neuron. Both 
the slow decay time constant of EPSPs (Fig. 1, E and F; table S1) and the minimal 
 7 
 
synaptic depression during repetitive stimulation (fig. S5) contributed to efficient 
temporal summation.  
 
To probe spatial summation, we stimulated two presynaptic cells converging 
on the same postsynaptic neuron. Costimulation of the presynaptic cells with 50-Hz 
trains of stimuli led to compound EPSPs almost indistinguishable from the arithmetic 
sum of individual unitary EPSPs (Fig. 4D). Thus, spatial summation had 
approximately linear characteristics (30, 31). To determine the number of convergent 
presynaptic inputs necessary to drive the cell to firing threshold, we plotted the 
depolarization evoked by train stimulation against the number of stimulated inputs, 
and determined the number of inputs required for spiking from the intersection of a 
regression line with the action potential threshold (Fig. 4, E and F; table S1). With a 
mean resting potential of –68.2 ± 1.0 mV and a mean action potential voltage 
threshold of –36.1 ± 1.6 mV, we estimated that 7.3 ± 1.9 coactive convergent inputs 
were required to initiate action potentials in a postsynaptic CA3 cell for 50 Hz 
stimulation. In the presence of ongoing synaptic activity in vivo, we estimated that 3.3 
inputs would be required (29). Thus, the large number of postsynaptic AMPARs and 
the efficient temporal and spatial summation underlie the efficacy of synaptic 
signaling at CA3–CA3 pyramidal neuron synapses.  
 
Biologically constrained network models of pattern completion  
The present experimental findings challenged several assumptions of previous 
pattern completion models (3–5, 9, 14). First, the low average connectivity may 
compromise pattern completion. Second, the small number of synaptic contacts per 
connection will introduce synaptic noise, which may impair pattern completion (14). 
To examine how the experimentally determined properties of CA3–CA3 cell 
synapses impact on pattern completion, we developed a real-size model of the 
hippocampal CA3 cell network (Fig. 5). The total number of neurons was 330,000, 
representing the CA3 network of one hemisphere (32). Synaptic plasticity was 
implemented according to a clipped Hebbian rule (8), in agreement with recent 
experimental results at CA3–CA3 synapses (33). The firing threshold was set 
according to the observation that ≥ 3 synaptic inputs were necessary to activate a 
postsynaptic neuron (Fig. 4F; 29). An increasing number of random patterns was 
stored in the network, and recall was tested with degraded patterns (see materials 
and methods; fig. S6; table S3). We first examined a network with a connection 
 8 
 
probability (p) of 3% and an activity level (f) of 0.001 (i.e. 330 active neurons per 
pattern). Such a network model produced robust pattern completion (capacity 
~45,000 patterns; Fig. 5B, left). Variation of the activity level confirmed that f = 0.001 
provided favorable conditions for recall (fig. S7), as previously suggested (14).  
 
Next, we examined how macroconnectivity affected pattern completion. 
When the connection probability in a random network was reduced, pattern 
completion was impaired (p = 1.5%; Fig. 5B, center) or completely abolished (p = 1%; 
Fig. 5B, right). Increasing the activity level (f = 0.002) partially rescued pattern 
completion (capacity ~8,200 patterns; Fig. 5C, left), although recall was only possible 
in a narrow range of inhibition. Incorporation of reciprocal, convergence, divergence, 
and chain motifs (34) also rescued pattern completion (capacity ~3,600 patterns; Fig. 
5C, center); recall was possible over a wide range of inhibition. Addition of reciprocal, 
convergence, and divergence motifs (i.e. all except chain motifs) failed to rescue 
pattern completion, showing that chain motifs played a critical role (Fig. 5C, right; fig. 
S8). Incorporation of all motifs also rescued pattern completion for p = 1.5%, but 
reduced capacity for p = 3% (fig. S9), showing that motifs selectively enhanced 
network performance in combination with sparse connectivity. Similar conclusions 
were reached in network models with limited projection along the longitudinal axis 
(35, 36) (fig. S10) and in network models with 2 x 330,000 neurons and contralateral 
projections (fig. S11, A and B). In contrast, pattern completion was impaired in 
network models with 1/3 x 330,000 neurons, suggesting that isolated CA3b 
subnetworks were insufficient for pattern completion (fig. S11, C and D).  
 
Finally, we tested how microconnectivity affected pattern completion. Two 
opposite predictions can be made. First, increasing the number of synaptic contacts 
per connection will reduce the coefficient of variation (CV) of synaptic transmission, 
which may enhance pattern completion (14). Second, increasing the number of 
contacts per connection would reduce the effective connectivity, because presynaptic 
terminals have to compete for space on dendritic spines of postsynaptic target cells. 
This may decrease network capacity (Fig. 5B). To assess the relative significance of 
these effects, we introduced synaptic variability in our simulations. With a connection 
probability of 3% and a CV of 1, pattern completion worked reliably (capacity ~7,000 
patterns; Fig. 5D, center). Reducing the CV improved pattern completion (capacity 
~22,000 patterns; Fig. 5D, left). However, reducing CV and connectivity in 
combination abolished pattern completion (capacity close to 0; Fig. 5D, right). 
 9 
 
Therefore, single-contact synapses with high variability were better suited for pattern 
completion than multi-contact synapses with low variability.  
  
Discussion  
Previous theories of the hippocampal formation often depicted the CA3 region as a 
network of highly interconnected cells, in which connectivity is all-to-all, random, or 
distance-dependent (3–5, 8, 9, 11, 14, 37). Our experimental results challenge this 
view in multiple ways. First, the macroconnectivity in the CA3 cell network is sparse, 
spatially uniform, and highly enriched in disynaptic connectivity motifs. This is 
different from the neocortex, where connection probability is higher (~10%), more 
distance-dependent, and less enriched in disynaptic motifs (17, 18, 22, 38). Second, 
the microconnectivity in individual CA3–CA3 connections is characterized by a small 
number of synaptic contacts and functional release sites per connection. Again, this 
is different from the neocortex, where unitary synaptic interactions involve a large 
number of contacts (up to 8 in layer 5–layer 5 pyramidal neuron pairs) (21–23, 26). 
Finally, despite the small number of synaptic contacts, the efficacy of unitary 
connections is high. Therefore, coincident firing of a small number of presynaptic 
cells is sufficient to initiate action potentials in a postsynaptic cell. Thus, the 
properties of recurrent CA3–CA3 synapses allow efficient encoding of information by 
small neuronal ensembles.  
 
Our results give important insights into the synaptic mechanisms of pattern 
completion. First, they provide a proof of principle that real-size networks with a 
realistic connection probability of 1% are able to perform pattern completion. Second, 
they demonstrate that connectivity motifs increase the efficacy and robustness of 
recall under conditions of sparse connectivity and sparse activity. Intuitively, 
incorporation of motifs will increase the variance in the number of inputs and outputs 
of each cell, which will facilitate the spread of activity in the network and thereby 
enhance the robustness of recall (14). Finally, they suggest that the design of CA3–
CA3 synapses with few synaptic contacts per connection is favorable, because it 
enables maximally efficient use of postsynaptic space. Thus, both macro- and 
microconnectivity facilitate pattern completion in the CA3 cell network. Similar 
conclusions were independently reached in a theoretical study, which deduced 
sparse connectivity and high motif abundance from the assumption of maximal 
storage capacity (39).

The mechanisms generating the motif structure are currently unknown. 
Anisotropy of axonal connections may contribute, but it is unlikely to be the only 
factor. One possibility is that connectivity motifs are formed during development, 
connecting clonally related groups of sister cells (40, 41). Alternatively, the motifs 
may arise from structural plasticity in synchronously active neuronal ensembles (33, 
42). Because mossy fiber synapses may “detonate” postsynaptic CA3 pyramidal 
neurons (43, 44), CA3 neurons innervated by the same mossy fiber axon might 
become preferentially connected through activity-dependent synaptic plasticity. This 
would provide a structured connection between pattern separation circuits of the 
dentate gyrus and pattern completion networks of the CA3 region (37). Similarly, CA3 
neurons targeted by the same entorhinal inputs could become connected. Finally, the 
CA3 connectome may be altered during chronic inactivity (45) or brain diseases (46). 
How this would affect pattern completion in the network remains to be determined.

Fig. 1. Octuple recording in the CA3 cell network. 
(A) Advantage of the octuple recording configuration. In sequential paired recordings 
from eight cells (left), 4 x 2 = 8 potential connections can be examined. In a 
simultaneous octuple recording (right), 8 x 7 = 56 potential connections can be 
tested.  
(B) Infrared differential interference contrast videomicrograph of the hippocampal 
CA3b region in a thick-slice preparation, with eight recording electrodes attached to 
the somata of putative pyramidal neurons. Red areas represent the 2D projections of 
cell bodies.  
(C) Functional connectomics in the CA3 pyramidal neuron network. Each column 
represents single traces from 8 cells; number code as shown in (B). In each of the 
eight columns, a different cell was stimulated by a series of five current pulses in 
current-clamp (blue traces), while the other cells were recorded in the voltage-clamp 
configuration (gray traces). In this octuple recording, cell 4 (dark blue trace) was 
connected to cell 3 (red traces). Scale bars, 50 mV or 10 pA, 10 ms (bottom, right). 
Brief transients in a subset of traces represent capacitive coupling artifacts, as 
reported in previous publications (e.g. Ref. 47).  
(D) Light micrograph of a biocytin-labeled octuple (maximal intensity projection stack; 
upper panel, low magnification; lower panel, high magnification). Eight CA3 pyramidal 
neurons in area CA3b were filled with biocytin during whole-cell recording and 
labeled using 3,3‘-diaminobenzidine as chromogen. Data in (B to D) were obtained 
from different octuples. For the octuple shown in (D), all eight cells were labeled with 
biocytin for illustration purposes, i.e. selective labeling (fig. S1) was not performed.  
(E and F) Properties of unitary EPSPs at CA3–CA3 synapses.  
(E) Representative traces. Top, presynaptic action potential; center, average EPSP; 
bottom, individual EPSPs.  
(F) Summary graphs of EPSP peak amplitude, latency, 20–80% rise time, and decay 
time constant.  
(G and H) Similar graphs as in (E and F), but for EPSCs. Asterisks in (E and G) 
indicate failures. In box plots, horizontal lines represent median, boxes quartiles, 
whiskers most extreme data points ≤ 1.5 interquartile range from box edges, and 
single points data from individual experiments. Throughout the paper, presynaptic 
action potentials are shown in blue, EPSPs in black, and EPSCs in red.

Fig. 2. Macroconnectivity of the CA3 cell network: Sparse and spatially uniform 
connectivity with overabundance of connectivity motifs. 
(A) Analysis of dependence of connection probability on intersomatic distance. Top, 
traces of action potentials and average unitary EPSPs at two different distances (214 
and 310 µm). Center, histogram of number of connections tested (white bars) and 
functional connections detected (gray bars). Bottom, connection probability, 
determined as the ratio of connections detected to connections tested, plotted versus 
distance. Error bars represent 95%-confidence intervals estimated from a binomial 
distribution. Red dashed line indicates the mean connection probability (0.92%). 
(B) Number of unconnected and unidirectionally connected pairs. Bar graphs show 
the number of a given motif in the experimental sample (open bars) and the predicted 
number in a network with random connectivity and mean connection probability of 
0.92% (filled bars). Data from 10,000 simulations; error bars indicate standard 
deviation. 
(C) Overabundance of disynaptic connectivity motifs: reciprocally connected pairs, 
convergence motifs, divergence motifs, and chains (from top to bottom). Left, traces 
of action potentials and average unitary EPSCs. Right, summary bar graphs. P 
values are indicated above the simulation bar. Note that the probability of 
experimentally observed connectivity motifs was significantly higher than expected by 
chance.  
(D) Detailed maps of superconnectivity motifs in our data set (7 connections in one 
octuple; 10 and 3 connections in two septuples; 3 connections in two quintuples). 
The probability that such connectivity motifs occur by chance is negligibly small.  
 
Fig. 3. Microconnectivity of the CA3 cell network: A small number of 
morphological contacts and functional release sites per unitary connection.  
(A) Digital reconstruction of a functionally connected CA3–CA3 pair based on the 
post-hoc biocytin labeling. Soma and dendrites of presynaptic cell are shown in 
magenta, axon of presynaptic cell in yellow, soma and dendrites of postsynaptic cell 
in cyan. Gray dot indicates putative synaptic contact; inset shows light micrograph of 
the contact.  
(B) Unitary EPSPs and EPSCs from the same morphologically reconstructed neuron. 
Upper traces represent presynaptic action potentials, center traces average unitary 
EPSPs, and bottom traces average unitary EPSCs.  
 16 
 
(C) Summary bar graphs of number of putative contacts per connection (top), number 
of contacts on basal versus apical dendrites (center), and number of contacts on the 
fimbrial = distal versus hilar = proximal regions (from the perspective of the 
presynaptic neuron).  
(D) Dendritic distance of putative contacts on the basal (left) and the apical (right) 
dendrites of the postsynaptic cell.  
(E) A small number of functional release sites revealed by changing the extracellular 
Ca2+ concentration. Top left, single EPSP traces during standard (2 mM Ca2+, black) 
and low release probability conditions (1 mM Ca2+, gray). Top right, plot of EPSP 
peak amplitude against experimental time at CA3–CA3 synapses during reduction of 
the extracellular Ca2+ concentration (gray area). Bottom, histogram of EPSP peak 
amplitude under standard (2 mM Ca2+; left) and low release probability conditions 
(1 mM Ca2+; right). Red curve shows the results of multiple probability binomial 
analysis (MP-BA). Note that changing the extracellular Ca2+ concentration markedly 
altered the proportion of failures and successes, but had relatively small effects on 
the amplitude of successes, suggesting a small number of functional release sites.  
(F) Summary graph of number of release sites (top, left), quantal EPSP amplitude 
(top, right), quantal EPSC amplitude (bottom, left), and coefficient of variation 
(bottom, right). In box plots, horizontal lines represent median, boxes quartiles, 
whiskers most extreme data points ≤ 1.5 interquartile range from box edges, and 
single points data from individual experiments.  
  
Fig. 4. Synaptic efficacy at recurrent CA3–CA3 synapses: Large postsynaptic 
conductance and efficient summation.  
(A) Analysis of postsynaptic conductance. Left, digital reconstruction of soma and 
dendrites of the postsynaptic cell in a synaptically connected CA3–CA3 pair based 
on the post-hoc biocytin labeling. Red circle indicates the putative synaptic contact. 
Latency, rise time constant, peak amplitude, and decay time constant were fit as free 
parameters.  
(B) Unitary EPSCs and estimated peak conductance. Top, presynaptic action 
potential and average EPSC (red trace), superimposed with the results of the 
postsynaptic conductance fit (black curve). Bottom, summary graph of peak 
conductance.  
 17 
 
(C) Rise time and decay time constant of the postsynaptic conductance. In box plots, 
horizontal lines represent median, boxes quartiles, whiskers most extreme data 
points ≤ 1.5 interquartile range from box edges, and single points data from individual 
experiments.  
(D) Efficient temporal and spatial summation at CA3–CA3 synapses. Left, EPSPs 
evoked by repetitive stimulation of the presynaptic neuron (10 stimuli applied at a 
frequency of 50 Hz). Center, EPSPs evoked by repetitive stimulation of another 
presynaptic neuron converging on the same postsynaptic cell. Right, EPSPs evoked 
by simultaneous repetitive stimulation of both presynaptic neurons (black), 
superimposed with the arithmetic sum of the individual responses (gray). Note that 
the two curves superimpose, indicating linear summation. In left and center 
subpanels, the top trace shows the presynaptic action potential, and the bottom trace 
represents the average EPSP.  
(E) Analysis of voltage threshold of action potential initiation. A ramp protocol was 
used to determine the action potential voltage threshold (criterion 20 V s-1, small 
crosses).  
(F) Plot of summated EPSP amplitude (50 Hz stimulation) against number of 
stimulated inputs (black circles). Voltage threshold values are shown for comparison 
(gray circles). Continuous red line indicates the results of linear regression of 
summation data. Dashed lines indicate mean number of inputs required to fire a 
postsynaptic CA3 pyramidal cell and the corresponding mean action potential 
threshold value. Histogram depicts the distribution of the estimated number of inputs 
required to fire the postsynaptic cell under in vitro conditions.  
  
Fig. 5. Pattern completion in a CA3 network model with sparse connectivity, 
disynaptic connectivity motifs, and single-contact synapses.  
(A) Left, schematic illustration of network topology. Large filled circles, principal 
neurons; large filled triangle, inhibitory interneuron; small open circles, potentiated 
synapses; small crosses, unpotentiated synapses. Center, correlation between actual 
and stored patterns, plotted against the number of the recall cycle. Pattern load was 
m = 50,000 (center) and 83,000 (right), respectively; connection probability p = 3%; 
inhibition factor g1 = 0.0072; random connectivity in both cases. Lines with different 
colors represent trajectories for 100 random patterns.  
 18 
 
(B) Dependence of pattern completion in an autoassociative memory network model 
on network connectivity. Connection probability was p = 3% (left; corresponding plot 
of pattern correlation against recall cycle shown in (A)), 1.5% (center), and 1% (right); 
random connectivity in all cases; average activity level f = 0.001. 3D plots indicate 
average correlation between original patterns and retrieved patterns, plotted against 
pattern load (m) and inhibition factor (g1). Height of the correlation plot is color coded, 
with red representing maximal and blue minimal correlation (see pseudocolor scale 
bar on top, right). Note that performance of the pattern completion network was high 
for a connection probability of 3%, but declined as connectivity was reduced.  
(C) Increasing activity and introducing connectivity motifs rescue pattern completion 
in sparsely connected networks. 3D plot of correlation against pattern load (m) and 
inhibition factor (g1). Left, p = 1% combined with increased activity (f = 0.002). 
Center, p = 1% combined with high abundance of motifs (recip = conv = div = chain = 
5). Right, p = 1% combined with selective elimination of chain motifs (recip = conv = 
div = 5; chain = 0).  quantifies how much the frequency of a motif exceeds the 
corresponding value for a random network.  
(D) Reducing the CV and connection probability, as may occur during the transition 
from single-contact to multi-contact synapses, alters network performance. Center, 
synaptic CV = 1, connection probability p = 3%. Left, effects of reducing CV without 
change in effective connectivity (CV = 1 / 3 = 0.577; p = 3%). Right, effects of 
correlated changes of CV and effective connectivity, with the total number of 
synapses kept constant (CV = 1 / 3 = 0.577; p = 1%). Random connectivity in all 
cases; average activity level f = 0.001. Note that the effects of connectivity dominated 
over those of CV.  
All simulations were performed with the real-size network (330,000 neurons with 
standard parameters). Sparse activity (f = 0.001) in all cases except panel C, left. For 
details, see materials and methods and table S3.

MATERIALS AND METHODS 
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES 
Slice preparation and octuple recording 
Thick transverse hippocampal slices (400 µm) were cut from left or right brain 
hemispheres of 15- to 31-day-old Wistar rats of either sex using a VT 1200 
vibratome. Animals were kept in an oxygenated chamber for 30 min, lightly 
anaesthetized with isoflurane (0.4% (v / v) added to the chamber volume at a flow 
rate of 2–3 ml min-1), and subsequently sacrificed by decapitation. Experiments 
were performed in strict accordance with institutional, national, and European 
guidelines 
for 
animal 
experimentation 
and 
were 
approved 
by 
the 
Bundesministerium für Wissenschaft, Forschung und Wirtschaft (A. Haslinger, 
Vienna). Hemispheres were mounted with “magic cut” angles of  close to 0 and 
 close to –5° (48), and were oriented such that the cutting blade advanced from 
basal to apical dendrites of CA3b pyramidal neurons. Parasagittal and frontal slice 
orientations were also tested, but resulted in reduced slice quality.  
 
Patch pipettes were pulled from thick-walled borosilicate glass tubing (2 mm 
outer diameter, 0.5 mm wall thickness); when filled with intracellular solution, the 
resistance was 1.6–5 M. Pipettes were positioned manually with eight LN mini 
25 micromanipulators under visual control provided by infrared differential 
interference contrast (IR-DIC) videomicroscopy. Targeted cell bodies were located 
~20–100 µm from the surface of the slice. CA3 pyramidal neurons were identified 
on the basis of morphological appearance in the videoimage and the action 
potential phenotype upon sustained current injection, with average firing 
frequencies of < 20 Hz during 1-s current pulses. Neurons with resting potentials 
more positive than –60 mV were discarded. The recording temperature was either 
~22°C (range: 19–24°C, room temperature), or ~34°C (33–36°C, near-
physiological temperature), as indicated. All recorded neurons were located in the 
CA3b subfield, a subregion with extensive recurrent collaterals (35, 36).  
 
Electrical signals were recorded using either four Multiclamp 700B 
amplifiers or a combination of two Multiclamp 700B and four Axopatch 200B 
  
 
3 
 
amplifiers. Signals were low-pass filtered with built-in Bessel filters at 5 or 6 kHz 
and digitized at 20 kHz with a CED 1401 power3 AD/DA converter connected to a 
personal computer. Pulse generation and data acquisition were performed using 
Signal 6.0 and custom-made stimulation–acquisition protocols. The presynaptic 
neuron was held in the current-clamp mode and stimulated with a repetition interval 
of 10–20 s, unless differently specified. Action potentials were elicited by brief 
current pulses (duration 2–5 ms, amplitude 1–2 nA). The postsynaptic cells were 
held in either current- or voltage-clamp mode. For current-clamp recording, pipette 
capacitance and series resistance were compensated, and compensation was 
readjusted during the experiment when necessary. For voltage-clamp recording, 
series resistance was not compensated, but carefully monitored using 2-mV 
hyperpolarizing pulses following the evoked EPSC. For analysis of EPSC kinetics, 
series resistance was ≤ 10 M (7.3 ± 0.3 M). For multiple probability binomial 
analysis, series resistance was ≤ 15 M and was constant within ≤ 20% of its initial 
value (see table S2).  
 
To test for chemical synaptic connectivity, a presynaptic neuron under 
current-clamp conditions was stimulated with a train of 5 or 10 current pulses 
(duration 2–5 ms, amplitude 1–2 nA, frequency 10–50 Hz), while keeping all the 
other neurons in the voltage-clamp configuration at –70 mV (Fig. 1C). In total, 15–
30 single traces were collected. A pair was judged to be monosynaptically 
connected if EPSCs were generated with a latency of < 3 ms at ~22°C and 1.6 ms 
at ~34°C, and had peak amplitudes of > 2.2–2.5 times the standard deviation of 
the preceding baseline. To test for electrical synapses, long hyperpolarizing 
current pulses (duration 250 ms, amplitude –50 pA) were applied to one neuron, 
and potential responses (outward currents) were examined in all other neurons. 
With this stimulation paradigm, electrical coupling could be unequivocally 
distinguished from capacitive coupling artifacts. In total, 15,930 pairs of neurons 
were tested for both chemical and electrical connectivity.

Labeling of pre- and postsynaptic neurons   
Pre- and postsynaptic neurons were filled with biocytin (0.2%) during recording for 
> 1 hour. To restrict labeling to synaptically connected neurons, uncoupled cells 
were rapidly subjected to a nucleated patch “delabeling” procedure, by gently 
retracting the recording pipette while applying negative pressure (50–150 mbar; 
fig. S1). This minimized labeling of the perisomatic region of the unconnected cells, 
and completely prevented labeling of their subcellular processes (dendrites and 
axons).  
After filling of pre- and postsynaptic neurons, pipettes were withdrawn from 
their somata, typically resulting in the formation of outside-out patches at the 
pipette tips. Slices were then fixed for 12–24 hours at 4°C in a 0.1 M phosphate 
buffer (PB) solution containing 2.5% paraformaldehyde (PFA), 1.25% 
glutaraldehyde (GA) and 15% (v/v) saturated picric acid solution. After fixation, 
slices were treated with hydrogen peroxide (1%, 10 min) to block endogenous 
peroxidases, and rinsed in PB several times. Membranes were permeabilized with 
2% Triton X-100 in PB for 1 h. Slices were then transferred to a phosphate-buffered 
solution containing 1% avidin-biotinylated horseradish peroxidase complex (ABC) 
and 1% Triton X-100 for ~12 hr. Excess ABC was removed by several rinses in PB 
and 
the 
slices 
were 
developed 
with 
0.036% 
3,3'-diaminobenzidine 
tetrahydrochloride (DAB), 0.01% hydrogen peroxide, and a 0.006% NiCl2 / 0.008% 
CoCl2 mixture for intensification. Finally, slices were embedded in Mowiol.  
 
 
Solutions 
For dissection and maintenance of slices, a sucrose-containing solution composed 
of 87 mM NaCl, 25 mM NaHCO3, 10 mM glucose, 75 mM sucrose, 2.5 mM KCl, 
1.25 mM NaH2PO4, 0.5 mM CaCl2, and 7 mM MgCl2 was used. During recording, 
slices were superfused with a physiological extracellular solution containing 
125 mM NaCl, 25 mM NaHCO3, 25 mM glucose, 2.5 mM KCl, 1.25 mM NaH2PO4, 
2 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgCl2, equilibrated with 95% O2 / 5% CO2 gas mixture. The 
pipette solution contained 135 mM K-gluconate, 20 mM KCl, 0.1 mM EGTA, 2 mM

adjusted to 7.28 with KOH). In all experiments, 10 µM gabazine was added to the

ANALYSIS 
Analysis of unitary EPSPs and EPSCs 
Unitary EPSPs and EPSCs were analyzed using C-Stimfit or Python-based scripts 
(49). The rise time was measured as the time interval between the points 
corresponding to 20 and 80% of the peak amplitude. The peak of the EPSP or 
EPSC was determined as the mean or maximum within a window of 1 or 2 ms 
duration, respectively, following the presynaptic action potential. The synaptic 
latency was determined as the time interval between the peak of the presynaptic 
action potential and the onset of the subsequent EPSP or EPSC; the onset point 
was determined from the intersection of a line through the 20 and 80% points with 
the baseline. The decay phase of the EPSPs or EPSCs was fit with a 
monoexponential function using a nonlinear least-squares fit algorithm. A trace 
was classified as a failure when the peak amplitude was less than three times the 
standard deviation of the preceding baseline. To quantify the multiple-pulse ratio, 
> 20 traces (including failures) were averaged. The amplitudes of the second and 
all subsequent EPSPs or EPSCs in the train were measured in average traces, 
setting the baseline directly before the onset of each synaptic event. To determine 
the number of inputs necessary to reach the firing threshold of a postsynaptic 
neuron, resting potentials were measured immediately after the whole-cell 
configuration was reached, and action potential voltage threshold was determined 
using depolarizing current ramps. Threshold was defined as the voltage at the 
point when the slope first exceeded a value of 20 V s-1 (Fig. 4, E and F). 
 
To determine the number of functional release sites of a synaptic 
connection, EPSPs or EPSCs were recorded in different extracellular Ca2+ 
concentrations. The entire unbinned data set of peak amplitudes was analyzed by 
MP-BA (multiple probability binomial analysis) using maximum-likelihood fitting 
(50). Peak amplitude data were fit by a single release model, with free parameters 
q (quantal size; range: 3–25 pA or 0.03–2.5 mV), CVq (coefficient of variation for 
  
 
6 
 
intra-site variability of q; range: 0.01–1.5), pR1 and pR2 (release probabilities in the 
two experimental conditions; range: 0.05–0.95), and different integer values of N 
(number of functional release sites; range: 1–10). One pair in which likelihood 
increased monotonically as a function of N was excluded from analysis. When the 
fit was not satisfactory, inter-site variability and variability in release probability 
were additionally tested. Unbinned data were analyzed by maximum-likelihood 
fitting.  
 
Reconstruction, localization of synaptic contacts, and cable modeling 
Neurons including soma, dendrites, and the entire axonal arborization were traced 
using a digital reconstruction system equipped with Neurolucida 9.0 reconstruction 
software (Microbrightfield), and 60 x / 1.4 numerical aperture (NA) and 100 x / 1.4 
NA oil-immersion objectives. Dendrites were identified based on the high density 
of spines. Axons were unequivocally identified by the absence of spines and the 
larger branching angles. Putative synaptic contacts between functionally 
connected neurons were identified light-microscopically as crossings of an axon 
and a dendrite in the same focal plane, and the presence of an expansion 
(representing a putative bouton) on the presynaptic side. Only pairs in which the 
dendritic tree of the postsynaptic cell appeared largely intact were included in the 
analysis.  
 
To estimate the true postsynaptic conductance at recurrent CA3–CA3 
synapses, we simulated EPSCs in realistic cable models of CA3 pyramidal 
neurons. After reconstruction of dendritic and axonal morphology, Neurolucida 
data were imported into Neuron 7.3 (52). The spatial discretization was set 
according to the “d_lambda” rule with d < 0.1 100 Hz. To ensure proper positioning 
of synapses, the spatial resolution for dendritic segments containing putative 
contacts was increased > 2 times. The integration time step was fixed to 10 µs.  
 
The synapse was modeled as an AMPAR-mediated biexponential 
conductance. Latency, rise time constant, peak amplitude, and decay time 
constant were varied until the best fit to the measured EPSC was obtained (rise 
time constant range: 0.01–3 ms; peak amplitude range: 0.1–10 nS; decay time 
  
 
7 
 
constant range: 2–15 ms). Specific membrane capacitance was assumed as 
1 µF cm-2, specific membrane resistance as 164 k cm2, and intracellular 
resistivity as 194  cm (53–55). The experimental value of series resistance for 
each experiment (≤ 10 M) was realistically incorporated into the model. 
 
Analysis of axon preservation in virtual slices 
To assess the effects of slice preparation on connectivity, we performed a “virtual 
slicing” simulation, using previous reconstructions of three in vivo labeled CA3 
pyramidal neurons (cells 51, 60a, and D256 imported from ModelDB; 35, 51, 56) 
(fig. S3). Neurons were shifted such that their somata were located in the center 
of the hippocampal formation (coordinates: x = 5600, y = 4200, and z = 2750 µm; 
56). Furthermore, cells were rotated so that dendritic sum vectors for apical and 
inverted basal dendrites were perpendicular to stratum pyramidale–stratum 
radiatum and stratum oriens boundaries.  
To quantify the proportion of axons contained in a virtual slice section, 
sections of different orientation were simulated. Slice thickness was 400 µm, and 
the soma was located in the center of the section, unless differently specified. For 
each section, the cumulative length of preserved axon segments and the volume 
of the CA3 pyramidal neuron layer were computed. To determine whether an axon 
segment was located inside or outside the virtual slice section, Euclidian distance 
of the segment from the surface plane was calculated as �
� . �
�
�, where �
� = (xi, yi, zi), 
xi, yi, and zi represent axon segment coordinates, and �
�
� is a normal unit vector 
perpendicular to the surface. This analysis revealed that the cumulative length of 
the axon contained in the virtual slice section was substantially reduced in 
comparison to the in vivo situation (fig. S3D). However, the volume of the CA3 
pyramidal neuron layer contained in the section was reduced in parallel (fig. S3E), 
consistent with the idea that the average connectivity in the slice was relatively 
unchanged.  
To quantify the axon connection factor in a given virtual slice section, i.e. 
the fraction of axon segments connected to the soma over the sum of all segments, 
axon segments inside a section were labeled as 1, and segments outside the 
  
 
8 
 
section as 0. For each axon segment, recursive backtracing to the soma was 
performed, and connectivity was computed as the product of all labels along the 
path. To mimic the experimental configuration, connectivity analysis was restricted 
to a 600-µm radius around the soma. The calculated axonal connection factor was 
~40% for 400-µm-thick sections (fig. S3F), and decreased substantially as the 
thickness of the sections was reduced or the soma was shifted from the center to 
the surface of the section (fig. S3G). Thus, thick slices and deep recordings, as 
used in our experiments, better maintained connectivity. Based on these results, 
total connectivity was predicted as fraction of preserved axon length / fraction of 
preserved pyramidal cell volume x axon connection factor. This analysis suggested 
that transverse slices showed the largest mean value and the smallest variability 
of total connectivity (fig. S3H).  
 
Statistics 
Values are given as mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM). Box plots show the 
lower quartile (Q1), the median (horizontal black line) and the upper quartile (Q3). 
Thus, the interquartile range (IQR = Q3–Q1) is represented as the height of the 
box. Whiskers extend to the most extreme data point that is no more than 1.5 x 
IQR from the edge of the box (Tukey style). Significance of differences was 
assessed by two-tailed Mann-Whitney test at the significance level (P) indicated 
(57). Membrane potentials reported in the text were not corrected for junction 
potentials. 
 
To test whether reciprocal, convergence, divergence, and disynaptic chain 
motifs occurred significantly more frequently than expected by chance, we 
simulated the entire set of recording configurations (72 octuples, 66 septuples, 118 
sextuples, 120 quintuples, 135 quadruples, 96 triples, and 495 double recordings) 
10,000 times, assuming random connectivity (58). The connection probability was 
set to the experimentally determined average value of 0.92%. Statistical P values 
were calculated as the number of simulated configurations in which the motif 
number was equal to or larger than the empirical number, divided by the number 
of simulations (10,000).

MODELING 
Basic structure of the CA3 network model  
Simulations of pattern completion in autoassociative memory network models 
were performed following previous work (9, 11, 14, 59) (table S3). The hallmark 
properties of the network were: usage of binary neurons, recurrent excitatory 
connectivity, clipped Hebbian plasticity, global threshold, linear global inhibition 
(proportional to total network activity), and iterative recall (Fig. 5A). Computations 
were run in three steps: (1) definition of connectivity matrix W, (2) storage of 
random patterns via synaptic plasticity (resulting in a synaptic weight matrix J), and 
(3) simulation of iterative recall triggered by degraded patterns. 
 
As finite-size effects are likely to be important (60), we modeled the network 
in realistic size. The total number of excitatory neurons n was 330,000, 
representing the CA3 pyramidal cell network of one hemisphere.  In a subset of 
simulations, models of double size (with 2 x 330,000 = 660,000 neurons) were 
implemented, to represent the activity of left and right hippocampus with 
contralateral connectivity (fig. S11, A and B). Furthermore, models of one third of 
original size (110,000 neurons) were tested, to evaluate pattern completion in an 
isolated CA3b region (fig. S11, C and D). 
To define the connectivity matrix W of size n x n, neurons were connected 
according to three different connectivity rules. First, neurons were connected 
randomly (58), assuming a uniform connection probability (p) and exclusion of 
autapses. Second, reciprocal, convergence, divergence, and disynaptic chain 
motifs were included. To achieve this, we used a SONET algorithm (34), setting 
recip, conv, div, and chain to values > 0, where  describes the enrichment of a 
given motif above the random level. Finally, in a subset of simulations, connectivity 
was restricted to two thirds of the network by eliminating connections from the 
matrix W, to account for the limited extent of CA3 pyramidal neuron axons along 
the septo-temporal axis (35, 36) (fig. S10).

Storage in the network model  
To simulate storage of information, random activity patterns were applied to the 
network. Patterns were vectors of binary numbers of length n, in which 0 
represented inactivity and 1 action potential firing. The total average activity level 
f was assumed as 0.001 (see Refs 13, 14, 58), consistent with sparse firing of CA3 
pyramidal neurons in vivo in non-sharp wave ripple periods during < 10-ms time 
intervals (61). Thus, for a 330,000 neuron network, a pattern vector contained on 
average 330 values of 1 and 329,670 values of 0. Before storage, the network was 
initialized by setting all elements of synaptic weight matrix J to 0.  
 
An increasing number (m) of random binary patterns was then loaded into 
the network. Synaptic plasticity was implemented using a clipped Hebbian rule (8, 
60). When both pre- and postsynaptic neurons were simultaneously active during 
a pattern, synaptic weights were updated to 1; otherwise weights were unchanged. 
The use of this rule was justified by experimental data, demonstrating both 
requirement for simultaneous pre- and postsynaptic activity and saturation of the 
extent of LTP at recurrent CA3–CA3 synapses (33). Mathematically, the synaptic 
weight matrix J was computed as the sum of the outer products of the pattern 
vectors, clipped at a maximal value of 1.   
 
Recall in the network model  
To simulate iterative recall, a subset (100) of the activity patterns originally applied 
in the storage phase was re-applied to the network. Patterns applied during recall 
were degraded in comparison to the original ones applied during storage. The 
proportion of validly firing neurons (bvalid) was 0.5 and the proportion of spuriously 
firing neurons (bspurious) was 0.001, corresponding to a correlation between original 
and degraded patterns of 0.71. We then simulated the ability of the network to 
iteratively recall the original patterns (14, 62). Neuronal activity was computed over 
10 or 50 recall cycles (62). For each recall cycle, the total input to the ith neuron at 
time t was calculated as  
 
  
 
11 
 
����� � 1
� ���
�� 
�
���
��� ���� �����,           �Eq. 1� 
 
where W denotes the connectivity matrix, J  represents synaptic weight matrix, P 
is a matrix incorporating synaptic variability, and X(t) is the network activity vector 
at time t (59). W, J, and P were multiplied in an element-wise manner. The matrix 
P was introduced to take into account the stochastic nature of transmitter release 
(i.e. synaptic amplitude fluctuations from trial to trial, including failures) (14). 
Random numbers had a mean value Iµ, a standard deviation I, and a coefficient 
of variation CV = I/ Iµ. In the default parameter set, Iµ was set to 1, and CV was 
set to 0 or 1.  
 
During iterative recall, a neuron was assumed to fire action potentials at 
time t + 1 if the condition 
 
����� � 1

 is the total activity, g1 is the proportionality factor 
of inhibition, and g0 is firing threshold (59). g1 was varied between 0 and 0.05. In 
the default parameter setting, g0 was assumed as 7 10-6, corresponding to three 
excitatory synaptic inputs. To explore the parameter space, parameters of the 
model were varied over a wide range in comparison to the default values (table 
S3, right column).  
 
 
Analysis of pattern correlation and capacity 
To quantify the accuracy of recall of a given pattern, pattern correlation (r) between 
original and recalled patterns was computed as the correlation coefficient between 
the corresponding vectors (57, 59). Pattern correlation was quantified for the 8th 
recall cycle, since steady-state conditions were nearly reached for this cycle (62; 
Fig. 5A).  Pattern correlation r was then plotted against the pattern load m and the 
  
 
12 
 
proportionality factor of inhibition g1. These 3-dimensional r–m–g1 plots (e.g. Fig. 
5) provided information about capacity, robustness of recall, and maximal 
correlation.  
 
Capacity (in number of patterns) was quantified as the maximum of the 
product function of pattern correlation (r)  and  pattern load (m). This definition was 
chosen to take into account both the number of patterns that can be stored and 
accurately recalled and the recall accuracy of these patterns. Robustness of 
pattern completion was quantified as the area enclosed by the 50% contour line in 
the r–m–g1 plots. Information capacity (in bit synapse-1) was calculated as  
� � ��������� ��� log� � � �1 � �� log��1 � ���
� � 
,               �Eq. 3� 
 
where Npatterns is capacity, f is activity level, n is the number of neurons, and p is 
connection probability (e.g. 60).  
 
Simulations of random connectivity matrices, storage, and iterative recall 
were implemented in C or C++, and run on x86_64-based shared memory systems 
(Supermicro or SGI Altix UV 1000 systems) using GNU/Linux (Debian, SLES), the 
GNU C compiler (GCC, 4.3.4, 4.9.2), and the GNU scientific library (GSL, 1.11, 
1.16). Simulations were run with up to 20 different seeds. Connectivity matrices 
containing disynaptic connectivity motifs were generated using the SONET 
simulation program package (34) after minor modifications. Changes included 
improvement in memory management, storage of matrices in sparse format, and 
adaptation to a 64-bit computation platform. Computer source code will be 
provided upon request.

Fig. S1. Selective labeling of synaptically connected cells in octuples.  
 
(A) A four-step procedure to achieve selective labeling of connected neurons. (1) 
Tight seal cell-attached configurations were obtained in all eight neurons. (2) The 
transition into the whole-cell configuration was made nearly simultaneously in all 
cells. (3) All pairs of cells were tested for possible connections. (4) Nucleated 
patches were isolated from the non-connected cells to avoid further loading with 
biocytin. The whole-cell configuration was maintained only in the synaptically 
connected cells, resulting in selective labeling of pre- and postsynaptic neuron.  
(B) Destaining by nucleated patch formation. Identification of synaptically 
connected cells (cells 6 and 7) and formation of nucleated patches in unconnected 
  
 
18 
 
cells (cells 1–5) in a septuple recording configuration. Note that pipette location 
and angle allowed unequivocal assignment of the cells.  
(C) Biocytin labeling after destaining procedure shown in (B). Intense labeling 
allowed full digital reconstruction of postsynaptic cell (cell 6, cyan) and presynaptic 
cell including axon (cell 7, magenta). In contrast, perisomatic labeling was faint or 
absent in the non-connected cells (red ellipses). Large inset shows single traces 
from a synaptic connection between cell 7 (magenta) and cell 6 (cyan), showing a 
functional connection. Small inset illustrates perisomatic areas of cell 1 
(unconnected, faint labeling) and cell 7 (connected, intense labeling).

Fig. S2. Chemical versus electrical coupling between CA3 pyramidal 
neurons.  
 
(A to D) Chemical synaptic transmission.  
(A) Unitary EPSCs at CA3–CA3 synapses under control conditions (black trace) 
and in the presence of 10 µM CNQX (red trace; postsynaptic membrane potential 
–70 mV).  
(B) Corresponding plot of unitary EPSC peak amplitude against experimental time 
during application of 10 µM CNQX (gray area). Note that CNQX completely 
  
 
20 
 
blocked unitary EPSCs, indicating that transmission was chemical in nature and 
mediated by AMPA-type glutamate receptors.  
(C and D) Unitary EPSCs in control conditions (C) and in Mg2+-free extracellular 
solution (D). EPSC amplitude increases in the absence of Mg2+, suggesting a 
contribution of NMDA-type glutamate receptors to the synaptic current.  
Chemical transmission was found in 146 out of 15,930 tested pairs.  
(E to I) Electrical synaptic transmission.  
(E) Infrared differential interference contrast image of two CA3 neurons electrically 
connected, presumably via a gap junction. Blue and red areas represent the 2D 
projections of the two cell bodies.  
(F and G) Postsynaptic voltage changes in response to a single action potential 
(F; 5 consecutive traces) and a train of 10 action potentials (G). Note that the 
postsynaptic response shows almost constant amplitude in consecutive trials, as 
characteristic for electrical synaptic transmission.  
(H and I) Current changes in a CA3 pyramidal neuron evoked in response to a long 
hyperpolarizing current pulse (50 pA, 250 ms) applied to the other cell. Current 
injection was made either in the blue cell (H) or the red cell (I). All traces were 
taken from the same CA3–CA3 pair (in a slice from a 16-day-old rat). 
Evidence for electrical coupling was found in one out of 15,930 tested pairs (63).

Fig. S3. Connectivity in transverse, parasagittal, and frontal slices.  
 
(A and B) “Virtual slicing” procedure. Surface graphics of the dentate gyrus and 
the CA3 and CA1 regions of the hippocampus (somatic and dendritic layers; (A)) 
and the CA3 and CA1 pyramidal neuron layer (B), superimposed with a 400-µm 
slice close to the transverse plane ( = 0;  = –5°) (48, 56).  
(C) Axonal arborization of a fully reconstructed CA3b pyramidal neuron (cell 51) 
(56). View from anterior direction. Blue and red, axon segments contained in a 
simulated 400-µm thick transverse slice (red, within a 600-µm radius from the 
soma; blue, outside a 600-µm radius). Black, axon segments outside the simulated 
slice. Green sphere represents cell body.

(D and E) Summary bar graph of cumulative axon length (D), and corresponding 
volume of the CA3 pyramidal neuron layer (E). Total, value for the intact brain; 
transverse, parasagittal, and frontal, values for simulated 400-µm sections of 
different orientations. Data were obtained from three different CA3 pyramidal 
neurons (cell 51, D256, and 60a) (56). Note that slicing decreased both the 
cumulative axon length and the CA3 pyramidal cell layer volume, so that the ratio 
was relatively unaltered by the slicing procedure. 
(F and G) Axon connection factor, i.e. fraction of axon segments connected to the 
soma over total number of axon segments, for 400-µm slices with soma in the 
center (F) and for different slice thicknesses and depth fractions (0 = surface, 0.5 
= center of the slice; average data from three cells and orientations; G). Note that 
axons crossing the surface of the virtual slice section were disconnected from the 
soma, so that the axon connection factor was significantly below 100%. Only axon 
segments within a 600-µm radius from the soma were considered.  
(H) Total connectivity, obtained as fraction of preserved axon / fraction of 
preserved pyramidal cell volume x axon connection factor for 400-µm slices with 
soma in the center. Red dashed line indicates 100% predicted connectivity. Note 
that transverse slices showed high connectivity and relatively small variability (at 
least for the three analyzed cells; left bar), whereas connectivity was more variable 
in parasagittal slices (middle bar) and smaller in frontal slices (right bar).

(A and B) Distance dependence of unitary EPSP (A) and EPSC peak amplitude 
(B). Red lines represent the result from linear regression; P = 0.74 and 0.13, 
respectively.  
(C) Average connectivity for slices from young (P15–18) and older (P19–31) rats 
(P = 0.372). Open circles represent data for each 1-day age interval.

(D) Number of connectivity motifs in both age groups. Bar graphs show the number 
of a given motif in the experimental sample (open bars) and the predicted number 
in a network with random connectivity (filled bars).  
(E) Properties of EPSCs from synaptic connections found in isolation (white boxes) 
and from synaptic connections embedded in disynaptic motifs (i.e. reciprocal, 
convergence, divergence, and chain motifs; gray boxes). Graphs show EPSC peak 
amplitude (P < 0.001), proportion of failures (P = 0.002), EPSC potency (i.e. 
amplitude of successes; P = 0.016), synaptic latency (P = 0.063), EPSC 20–80% 
rise time (P = 0.060), and EPSC decay time constant (monoexponential fitting; P 
= 0.251). Note that some of the unidirectional connections may belong to 
connectivity motifs that were not recorded during the experiment.  
In box plots, horizontal lines represent median, boxes quartiles, whiskers most 
extreme data points ≤ 1.5 interquartile range from box edges, and single points 
data from individual experiments. Asterisks indicate P < 0.05.

(A) Unitary EPSCs during train stimulation at 20 Hz at ~22°C. Top trace, 
presynaptic action potentials; bottom trace, average EPSC.  
(B) Plot of EPSCn / EPSC1, plotted against the number n of the stimulus. Red curve 
represents the results of curve fitting with a single exponential function with an 
offset. Mean values from 10 pairs at ~22°C. 
  
 
26 
 
(C and D) Similar data as shown in (A and B), but at near-physiological 
temperature (~34°C). Mean values from 9 pairs. Dashed lines in (B and D) indicate 
an EPSCn / EPSC1 ratio of 1.  
(E) Summary bar graph of results at ~22°C and ~34°C. Note moderate depression 
at ~22°C versus slight facilitation at ~34°C. 
(F) Cumulative plot of EPSC peak amplitude against stimulus number (at ~22°C). 
Amplitude was normalized to that of the first stimulus. The last 5 data points were 
analyzed by linear regression. The offset was 1.71, and the slope was 1.21 
stimulus-1. For a number of functional release of 3.2 and a release probability of 
0.37, this corresponds to a refilling rate of 1.43 vesicles stimulus-1.

Fig. S6. Storage and recall of patterns in a real-size CA3 network model.  
 
Storage was performed with a single test pattern with activity in the first 330 
neurons and a variable number of subsequent random patterns. Recall was 
examined with the first pattern. Average activity level (f) was 0.001, similar to 
activity level in the first pattern (330 / 330,000). (A) Storage and recall of a single 
pattern in the network model. Left, elementwise product of connectivity matrix and 
synaptic weight matrix (W J) after storage of the first pattern; each black point 
represents a potentiated synapse in the matrix. Right, raster plot of neuron firing 
in the recall phase. Each red circle represents activity of a single neuron in the 
network. Recall was triggered with a degraded test pattern (bvalid = 0.5, bspurious = 
0.001; correlation between original pattern and test pattern 0.71; see materials and 
  
 
28 
 
methods). Note the almost perfect recall of the original pattern (pattern correlation 
between retrieved pattern and test pattern at 8th recall cycle 0.97, number on top).  
(B) Similar to (A), but after storage of 50,000 patterns in the network (pattern load 
m = 1 + 49,999). Note the accurate recall of the original pattern (pattern correlation 
between retrieved pattern and test pattern at 8th recall cycle 0.89).  
(C) Similar to (A), but after storage of 83,000 patterns in the network (pattern load 
m = 1 + 82,999). Note that the recall performance decreased, due to both lack of 
valid firings and generation of spurious firings (pattern correlation between 
retrieved pattern and test pattern at 8th recall cycle 0.0006).  
Total number of neurons in the network 330,000; only subsets of neurons (1,000 
in left panels; 10,000 in right panels) are shown for clarity (see inset in (A), left). 
Connection probability p = 3%; random connectivity. Raster plots in (B) and (C) 
correspond to the plots of pattern correlation versus recall cycle shown in Fig. 5A.

Fig. S7. Dependence of pattern completion on total activity level.  
3D plots of pattern correlation versus pattern load (m) and inhibition factor (g1) for 
connection probability p = 3% and different total activity levels f.  
(A) f = 0.001 (standard parameter value).  
(B) f = 0.0005.  
(C) f = 0.00075.  
(D) f = 0.005.  
Random connectivity in all cases. Capacity (C) numbers indicate the maximum of 
m x r. Note that maximal capacity was obtained for an activity level f = 0.00075. 
For smaller activity levels, pattern completion failed because synaptic activity was 
below the activation threshold. For larger activity levels, capacity also decreased, 
consistent with previous theoretical studies (13, 64, 65).

Fig. S8. Relative importance of reciprocity, convergence, divergence, and 
chain motifs for pattern completion.  
 
(A) Effects of selective incorporation of individual connectivity motifs. 3D plots of 
pattern correlation versus pattern load (m) and inhibition factor (g1) for connection 
probability p = 1% and recip = 5, conv = 0, div = 0, and chain = 0 (left), recip = 0, 
conv = 5, div = 0, and chain = 0 (center), and recip = 0, conv = 0, div = 5, and chain 
= 0 (right). The network models were unable to generate pattern completion. For 
recip = conv = div = chain = 5, see Fig. 5C, center. Note that recip = conv = div = 
0 and chain = 5 could not be tested, because this case does not give real solutions 
for the decomposition of the covariance matrix in the SONET algorithm (34). 
(B) Effects of global reduction of connectivity motifs. 3D plot of pattern correlation 
versus pattern load (m) and inhibition factor (g1) for connection probability p = 1% 
and recip = conv = div = chain = 3 (left), recip = conv = div = chain = 2 (center), and 
recip = conv = div = chain = 1 (right). Note that the performance of the pattern 
completion network gradually declined.

Fig. S9. Effects of motifs for different connection probability values.  
 
Effects of connectivity motifs for different connectivity p = 3% and recip = 9; conv 
= div = chain = 4 (left), p = 1.5% and recip = 8; conv = div = chain = 5 (center), and 
p = 1% and recip = conv = div = chain = 5 (right). Note that the same  values 
could not be tested, because these cases do not give real solutions for the 
decomposition of the covariance matrix in the SONET algorithm (34). For 
comparison with networks without motifs, see Fig. 5B.

Fig. S10. Sparsely connected real-size network models with limited axon

(A and B) 3D plots of pattern correlation versus pattern load (m) and inhibition 
factor (g1) for networks in which axon arborization is confined to 2 / 3 of the 
  
 
33 
 
longitudinal axis. Connection probability p = 3% and random connectivity (A), 
connection probability 1% with recip = conv = div = chain = 5 (B).  
(C and D) Similar analysis, but for circular arrangement of neurons and 
connectivity. For a connection probability of 1% and random connectivity, recall 
was not possible, neither in the linear nor in the circular case (capacity 0; not 
illustrated).  
Schemes on top illustrate restricted connectivity (left) and corresponding 
connectivity matrices (right; yellow = possible connectivity; blue = no connectivity). 
Note that the basic properties of the network were similar to those of the network 
with unlimited axonal projection (Fig. 5, B and C).

(A and B) Pattern completion in a double-size network model. 3D plots of pattern 
correlation versus pattern load (m) and inhibition factor (g1) for connection 
probability p = 3% with random connectivity (A), and 1% with structured 
connectivity (recip = conv = div = chain = 5; B). In both simulations, the network 
  
 
35 
 
size was 2 x 330,000 = 660,000 neurons to represent two extensively 
interconnected hippocampal CA3 networks (scheme on top).  
(C and D) Pattern completion in a one-third size network model. 3D plots of pattern 
correlation versus pattern load (m) and inhibition factor (g1) for connection 
probability p = 3% with random connectivity (C), and 1% with structured 
connectivity (recip = conv = div = chain = 5; D). In both simulations, the network 
size was 1 / 3 x 330,000 = 110,000 neurons to depict the isolated CA3b subregion, 
from which the experimental data were obtained (scheme on top). Note that pattern 
completion was markedly impaired in the isolated CA3b subnetwork.

Left seven columns indicate parameters of the model. Right six columns indicate 
measured quantities and reference to Figures as applicable. First row indicates 
standard parameter values (red). Other rows indicate alterations of parameters 
(black on green background).   
 
1 Capacity was measured as the maximum of m x r, where m is pattern load and 
r is pattern correlation. 
 
2 c was quantified as capacity divided by the number of cells.  
 
3 rmax represents maximal pattern correlation during retrieval.  
 
4 Retrieval area is the area enclosed by the half-maximal pattern correlation (rmax 
/ 2) contour line in r–m–g1 plots.  
 
5 For a network with n = 330,000; p = 0.03; bvalid = 1, bspurious = 0, i.e. retrieval with 
original pattern, the information capacity was calculated as 0.08 bits per synapse. 
This was lower than the information capacity of the Willshaw model with binary 
learning rule for an autoassociative task (ln 2 / 4 = 0.17 bits synapse-1) (66) or the 
Hopfield model with additive learning rule (1 / (8 ln 2) = 0.18 bits synapse-1) (64). 
However, in our model, (1) capacity was calculated from the product m x r, giving 
lower values, and (2) the number of active neurons per pattern was not constant, 
but varied statistically between patterns (which reduces capacity; 67), (3) finite-
size models generally show smaller capacity than infinite-size models (60).  
 
6 For a network with n = 330,000; p = 0.03; bvalid = 1, bspurious = 0, i.e. retrieval with 
original pattern, c, the pattern-to-neuron ratio, was calculated 0.213. This was 
higher than the value of a Hopfield model (11, 13), but below the theoretical bound 
obtained with the Gardner approach (c = 2, 68). Thus, networks based on 
biological constraints may operate below the theoretical limit.
