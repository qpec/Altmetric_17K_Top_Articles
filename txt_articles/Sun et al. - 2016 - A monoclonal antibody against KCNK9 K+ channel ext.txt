Two-pore domain potassium (K2P) channels act to maintain cell resting membrane
potential—a prerequisite for many biological processes. KCNK9, a member of K2P family, is
implicated in cancer, owing to its overexpression in human tumours and its ability to promote
neoplastic cell survival and growth. However, KCNK9’s underlying contributions to
malignancy remain elusive due to the absence of specific modulators. Here we describe the
development of monoclonal antibodies against the KCNK9 extracellular domain and their
functional effects. We show that one antibody (Y4) with the highest affinity binding induces
channel internalization. The addition of Y4 to KCNK9-expressing carcinoma cells reduces cell
viability and increases cell death. Systemic administration of Y4 effectively inhibits growth of
human lung cancer xenografts and murine breast cancer metastasis in mice. Evidence for
Y4-mediated carcinoma cell autonomous and immune-dependent cytotoxicity is presented.
Our study reveals that antibody-based KCNK9 targeting is a promising therapeutic strategy in
KCNK9-expressing malignancies.

on channels facilitate the passage of ions across cellular
membranes in all organisms. Transient change of ionic
distribution alters membrane potential, which forms the basis
for a variety of biological processes. Potassium (K þ) channels
are the most abundant and diverse ion channels1. Among them,
two-pore
domain
K þ
(K2P)
channels
are
the
newest
members. To date, 15 mammalian K2P channel subtypes
(Fig. 1a) have been discovered2 and each subtype plays a
distinct role in physiological processes and disease, including
mental retardation, familial migraine and cancer2–5. Despite their
significance, we have gained limited knowledge about individual
K2P subtypes partly due to K2Ps’ nature of being highly
homologous and the paucity of subtype-specific tools.
KCNK9 is a member of the K2P channel family. Under
physiological conditions, KCNK9 is primarily expressed in tissues
of the central nervous system such as the cerebellum and acts to
maintain
resting
membrane
potential
and
regulate
action
potential firing2. KCNK9 has also been implicated in cancer
based on genetic evidence. For instance, 10% of breast tumours
showed 3- to 10-fold KCNK9 genomic amplification, along with
5-fold to over 100-fold messenger RNA overexpression in 40% of
breast and lung cancers5. Enforced KCNK9 expression promotes
malignant transformation of mouse mammary gland epithelial
cells and embryonic fibroblasts in nude mice, possibly by
improving
cell
survival
under
hypoxic
or
serum-deprived
conditions5,6. However, how endogenous KCNK9 contributes to
neoplasia and its potential as a therapeutic target remain elusive
due to the lack of specific modulators of KCNK9 functions.
Genetic studies of K2P channels are often difficult to interpret
because of developmental and compensatory effects7. High-
throughput chemical screening has been carried out to identify
KCNK9-specific probes but has resulted in limited progress8. This
is partly because it is difficult to design chemical screens for
targets with high sequence and structure homology. Antibodies,
known for their exquisite selectivity, have been broadly used to
target cell surface receptors and antigens, especially as applied to
cancer treatment9–11. However, the feasibility of using antibodies
to modulate ion channel activity is not well explored.
K2P channels share considerable architectural similarity. They
assemble as dimers; each subunit contains two pore-lining regions
(P1 and P2) and four transmembrane domains (M1–M4). One
signature feature of K2P channels is a loop of B60 amino acids
on the extracellular side between the M1 and P1 domains, known
as the M1P1 loop. Crystal structure analysis of human K2P
channels reveals this loop as a structured domain that ‘caps’ the
extracellular ion pathway, providing an explanation for K2P’s
insensitivity
to
common
channel
blockers12,13.
Mutational
analysis and chimera studies have provided compelling evidence
for M1P1 loop’s role in sensing extracellular stimuli and
regulating channel gating14,15. Sequences within the M1P1 loop
are poorly conserved among K2P subtypes, representing a
desirable extracellular epitope reservoir. Provided that the
M1P1
loop
harbours
important
modulatory
sites14,15,
we
hypothesize that antibodies raised against the M1P1 loop will
allow selective manipulation of KCNK9 functions.
In this study, we developed an inhibitory antibody against the
extracellular domain of KCNK9. We characterized antibody-based
KCNK9 targeting and found it effectively inhibited cancer cell
survival, tumour growth and metastasis. Knowledge and research
strategies gained from this study are likely to have general benefits
to studies of other related channels in health and disease.
Results
M1P1 targeting antibodies inhibit KCNK9 channel activity. To
generate
antigens
that
recapitulate
native
human
KCNK9
(hKCNK9) structure, the M1P1 loop (Fig. 1b,c) was expressed as
a recombinant protein in HEK293T and CHO-S cells, to optimize
preservation of three-dimensional structure and posttranslational
modifications (Fig. 1d and Supplementary Fig. 1). Forty murine
monoclonal antibodies were successfully generated. Among them,
4 monoclonal antibodies were raised to hK9M1P1-mIgG2aFc,
designated as Y-mAbs; 36 monoclonal antibodies were raised
to hGH-hK9M1P1, designated as H-mAbs. All monoclonal
antibodies were IgG1 and demonstrated a subtype-specific
binding
to
hKCNK9
over
other
K2P
subtypes
including
hKCNK3—the K2P member most closely related to hKCNK9
(Fig.
2a,b
and
Supplementary
Fig.
2).
Y-mAbs
displayed
nanomolar to subnanomolar affinity, to recombinant hKCNK9
protein with Y4 having the highest affinity (KDB0.7 nM).
Y-mAbs also cross-reacted with recombinant murine KCNK9
(mKCNK9) with a lower affinity (Fig. 2c,d). The degree of
cross-reactivity was different among the Y-mAbs. As hKCNK9
and mKCNK9 M1P1 loops differ by only five amino acids
(Fig.2c), differential cross-reactivity provides insight into the
distinctive epitopes recognized by the Y-mAbs.
We tested the effects of Y- and H-mAbs on hKCNK9 channel
using
a
thallium
(Tl þ)-based
fluorescent
ion-flux
assay
developed for hKCNK9 chemical screening8,16. In this assay,
recorded fluorescent signal is proportional to the number of open
K þ channels on the cell surface (Fig. 3a). Twelve monoclonal
antibodies
showed
positive
staining
on
the
surface
of
hKCNK9-expressing
HEK293
cells
and
their
effects
on
hKCNK9 function were assessed in the Tl þ assay (Fig. 3b
and
Supplementary
Fig.
3a).
Six
of
these
monoclonal
antibodies were effective in inhibiting hKCNK9 conductance
following a preincubation protocol (Fig. 3c and Supplementary
Fig. 3b,d). This inhibition was not due to differences in cell
viability as indicated by comparable fluorescence intensities
at time 0 of fluorescence measurement (Supplementary Fig. 3c).
Y4 was most potent showing up to 30% inhibition of Tl þ
signal after 36 h monoclonal antibody incubation. Hence, we
chose
Y4
for
follow-up
studies.
Time-course
experiments
indicated that Y4-mediated channel inhibition was significant
after
6 h
incubation.
The
inhibitory
effect
was
stronger
after longer exposures (Fig. 3c,d and Supplementary Fig. 3d)
and dependent on the monoclonal antibody concentration
(Fig.
3e).
We
also
set
up
electrophysiological
assays
to
examine the possibility of acute blocking of hKCNK9 by Y4
and found no detectable effects with 20 min of perfusion
(Supplementary Fig. 4).
Y4 induces KCNK9 channel internalization from cell surface.
The
time
dependence
of
Y4-mediated
channel
inhibition
suggested a mechanism of antibody-induced endocytosis17–19
and
we
examined
this
possibility
using
flow
cytometry.
hKCNK9-overexpressing
HEK293
cells
were
incubated
with Y-mAbs for 12 h at 30 �C and channels remaining on the
cell surface were stained, as outlined in Supplementary Fig 5a.
Flow cytometry analysis showed that 15.6% KCNK9-positive
cells completely lost cell surface signal and became KCNK9
negative,
and among cells that remained KCNK9-positive
their overall fluorescence decreased by 25.7%. Reduction of cell
surface KCNK9 occurred only in response to Y4 treatment but
not to treatment with other Y-mAbs (Supplementary Fig. 5b–d).
For
further
analysis,
we
used
confocal
microscopy
to
track fluorescently labelled Y4. Fluorescent conjugation of Y4
did not alter its binding affinity (Supplementary Fig. 5h).
Upon incubation, a consistent reduction of surface signal
along with increased intracellular signal, predominantly visible
in the perinuclear region, was observed only at a temperature

EEA1, an early endosome marker (Fig. 3f). This phenomenon
is
specific
to
hKCNK9,
as
no
change

that

of
functional channels from cell surface can be one of the
mechanisms that led to reduced channel conductance observed
in the ion-influx assay.
Y4 recognizes endogenous KCNK9 in cancer cell lines. KCNK9
overexpression has been reported in B30% of both breast
and lung cancers5. Enforced KCNK9 expression promotes
tumour-propagating capacity of non-neoplastic cells and this
property is eliminated by co-expressing a dominant-negative
KCNK9 mutant, suggesting a role for KCNK9 during tumour
growth5,6. To assess the clinical relevance of KCNK9, correlations

Figure 4 | KCNK9 shows clinical relevance and Y4-mediated targeting exhibits anti-cancer effects in vitro. (a) Kaplan–Meier curves for survival
of patients with squamous cell lung cancer and breast cancer in relation to KCNK9 gene expression level. Data sets were obtained from commonly used
published studies20,21. Patients’ gene expression data and clinical data were manually matched. Patients with both KCNK9 expression and survival data
were segregated into two groups according to KCNK9 expression level—KCNK9 high (twofold higher than mean) and KCNK9 low (twofold lower than
mean). Survival was analysed using the Prism Kaplan–Meier package and log-rank Mantel–Cox statistical test. We performed the same analysis to examine

 analysed using publicly available microarray data sets20,21. We
found an inverse correlation between KCNK9 expression and
overall survival of patients with either squamous cell lung or
breast cancer (Po0.05). In squamous cell lung cancer, the 2-year
relative survival rates of low KCNK9 expressers increased by 58%
compared with high expressers. The hazard ratio between KCNK9
high and low groups is 2.8 (95% confidence interval: 1.222–
6.329). In breast cancer patients, the 10-year relative survival rates
of low KCNK9 expressers increased by 10% compared with high
expressers. The hazard ratio between KCNK9 high and low
groups is 1.6 (95% confidence interval: 1.005–2.556). In both
cancer types, this survival benefit is KCNK9 specific, as the same
analysis using KCNK3, the closest related member of KCNK9,
showed no significant correlations with patient survival (Fig. 4a).
This supports the notion that KCNK9 promotes tumour growth
and
may
be
a
therapeutic
target
in
KCNK9-expressing
malignancies.
Given that Y4 binds and internalizes hKCNK9 in a K2P
subtype-specific manner, it affords an advantageous strategy to
investigate the role of endogenous KCNK9 in cancer biology. The
BEN squamous cell lung cancer cell line was previously shown to
have abundant hKCNK9 mRNA6. This was confirmed at the
protein level and cell surface channel expression was validated by
flow cytometry (Fig. 4b). Subsequently, we screened a panel of
human and murine cancer cell lines by quantitative reverse
transcriptase–PCR
(Supplementary
Fig.
6a,b)
followed
by
validation via western blotting and flow cytometry. In addition
to BEN, the BT-549 human breast cancer cell line and cells from
LX22 patient-derived xenograft of small cell lung cancer were
found to express hKCNK9 at a relatively high level. The
MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cell line, on the other
hand, had undetectable expression of hKCNK9 (Fig. 4b).
mKCNK9 was present in metastatic and non-metastatic murine
breast
cancer
cell
lines
(Supplementary
Fig.
6b).
Higher
expression levels were found in two metastatic cell lines 66.1
and 410.4, suggesting a potential role of KCNK9 in metastasis. Y4
stained 410.4 cells, indicating sufficient cross-reactivity with
mKCNK9 (Fig. 4b). Interestingly, BEN, BT-549, LX22 and 410.4
cells showed two cell populations based on surface staining of
KCNK9, designated as K9 þ and K9 �. K9 � BEN cells were
stable after in vitro culture; hence, we used them as a negative
control for subsequent in vitro studies (Supplementary Fig. 6c).
Y4 reduces cell viability and increases cell death. Inhibition of
KCNK9 via a dominant-negative mutant or short hairpin RNA
was shown to inhibit cancer cell proliferation by 25B65%
(refs 6,22). Similar to the effect of Y4 on inducing the
internalization of transgenic hKCNK9 in HEK293, we found
that Y4 induced internalization of endogenous KCNK9 in BEN
cell line with 21.7% reduction of KCNK9-positive cells and 9.8%
reduction
of
overall
fluorescence
in
KCNK9-positive
cells
(Supplementary Fig. 5e–g). To evaluate whether this Y4-medi-
ated modulation of KCNK9 has any biological effects, BEN, BT-
549, MDA-MB-231, LX22 and 410.4 cells were treated with
antibodies 24–72 h in 10 or 0.1% heat-inactivated serum. Y4
applied at 0.4 mg ml � 1 significantly suppressed the viability of
K9 þ BEN, BT-549, LX22 and 410.4 cells but not K9 � BEN or
MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig. 4c). Inhibition of K9 þ BEN and LX22
cells was more prominent at 0.1% serum, consistent with previous
reports showing more pronounced effects of mutant KCNK9 in
low serum6.
Changes in cell viability could be due to alterations in cell
proliferation, cell death or metabolism. To further dissect Y4’s
biological effects, we measured L-lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)
release as a readout of cell death following monoclonal antibody
treatment. Y4 induced significant cell death of K9 þ BEN,
BT-549, LX22 and 410.4 cells. No significant LDH release
was detected in K9 � BEN or MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig. 4c).
This suggests that the observed reduction in cell viability could
be
attributed
to
increased
cell
death.
The
correlation
of cytotoxicity with target abundance is consistent with a
KCNK9-specific mechanism.
Y4 suppresses tumour growth in vivo. To investigate Y4’s
therapeutic effects, antibodies were administered intraperitoneally
(i.p.) at 4 mg kg � 1 into nu/nu mice either on the same day of
BEN subcutaneous engraftments, to monitor effects during
tumour initiation, or after visible tumours formed, to monitor
effects on established tumours. Y4 effectively suppressed tumour
growth in both experimental designs (Fig. 5a,f). In comparison,
another anti-KCNK9 monoclonal antibody (H8) had no effects
on
tumour
growth
(Supplementary
Fig.
7).
Systemic
administration of Y4 was well tolerated in mice as suggested by
no dramatic changes in body weight (Fig. 5b,g). Ki67 and cleaved
caspase-3 staining showed that Y4-treated tumour sections had
a lower proliferative index and a higher apoptotic index,
respectively (Fig. 5c,d,h,i). Protein extractions from Y4-treated
tumours also showed reduced hKCNK9 expression as normalized
to b-actin (Fig. 5e,j). We verified Y4’s in vivo effects in LX22—a
highly aggressive patient-derived xenograft model of small cell

 examined Y4’s effects on lung colonization. Y4-treated animals
showed significantly fewer lung metastases with no detectable
toxicity (Fig. 6a). These data suggest that Y4 not only is effective
against primary tumour formation but also metastasis. Y4 is a
murine IgG1 isotype, which possesses the ability to mediate
effector functions including complement-dependent cytotoxicity
(CDC) and antibody-mediated cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC).
Thus, inhibition of lung metastasis could be due to direct effects
via KCNK9 inhibition and/or elevated immune responses via
monoclonal antibody effector functions. We extracted mRNA
from lung tissues and characterized the expression of immune
markers24. Y4-treated mice showed higher infiltration of CD56 þ
natural killer cells, granzyme B þ cytotoxic T cells and increased
T-cell
chemoattractant
chemokine
(C-X-C
motif)
ligand-9
(Fig. 6b). We have shown previously that enforced expression
of chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand-9 inhibits growth and
metastasis of murine breast cancer cells by a mechanism
involving natural killer and T cells25.
To explore Y4’s potential for inducing immune effector
responses, we performed in vitro CDC and ADCC assays. We
incubated cancer cells with Y4 for 2 h in the presence of murine
complement before LDH assay. Y4 was effective in inducing CDC
against K9 þ BEN and BT-549 cells. This response was dependent
on the complement concentration, whereas no effects were found
in K9 � BEN cells or if complement was heat inactivated (Fig. 6c).
To
investigate
the
possibility
of
Y4-induced
ADCC,
we
incubated BEN cells with increasing Y4 concentrations in the
presence of bioluminescent Jurkat T-reporter cells established for
ADCC studies26. We found a dose-dependent induction of
ADCC as indicated by luciferase activity (Fig. 6d). Based on these
in vitro findings, we speculate that Y4-mediated inhibition of
metastasis may involve both cell-autonomous effects and/or
immune-dependent pathways.
Discussion
We
developed
a
monoclonal
antibody-based
strategy
that
selectively and effectively inhibits the function of KCNK9 via a
mechanism
that
involves
monoclonal
antibody-induced
internalization. Taking advantage of this tool, we discovered
KCNK9’s pivotal role in promoting cancer cell survival and
growth, and that monoclonal antibody-based targeting of KCNK9
has therapeutic promise in the treatment of primary tumour and
metastasis, through inhibiting KCNK9 channel function and/or
activating anti-tumour immune responses.
The human genome encodes over 400 ion channel genes. This
vast number and diversity allow ion channels to mediate a broad
spectrum of biological processes including nerve and muscle
excitation, hormone secretion, cell proliferation, learning and
memory. Consequently, defects in ion channel function often
have profound physiological effects. To date, mutations in over 60
different ion channel genes have been found to cause human
diseases27. Because of their clinical significance, ion channels
make up the second largest class of drug targets28. Despite
extensive investigation, 40% of characterized ion channels have
no known ligand/drug reported and most inhibitors for the
remaining 60% are nonselective. Therefore, there is an increased
focus
towards
more
selective
pharmacological
agents27.
Antibodies constitute the fastest growing class of therapeutics.
Antibody-based therapies are well established for cancer and
inflammatory diseases11,29,30. Although antibodies are effective
tools for ion channel research, the utilization of antibodies as ion
channel modulators is poorly explored. This is due, in part, to
poor epitope accessibility and specificity of extracellular domains,
as well as technical challenges in obtaining high-quality antigens
and establishing effective functional screening. This is probably
why most antibody modulators reported so far are polyclonal
with little or no biological activity1.
High-resolution mapping of an amplicon in human breast and
lung
cancers
identified
KCNK9
as
the
only
gene
with
genomic amplifications. Follow-up analysis confirmed KCNK9
overexpression at the mRNA and protein levels5. Enforced
KCNK9
expression
conferred
tumorigenicity
to
otherwise
non-tumorigenic cells5. Since these initial studies, KCNK9’s
oncogenic properties have been explored in multiple cancer
cell lines6,22,31. Depending on the cancer type and method used
to manipulate channel function, KCNK9 had different roles
in
tumorigenicity.
For
example,
inhibiting
KCNK9
via
dominant-negative mutant, anti-sense short hairpin RNA or
nonspecific chemical blockers suppressed proliferation of lung
carcinoma and melanoma cells6,22. In contrast, pharmacological
manipulation of KCNK9 with chemical modulators known to
lack subtype specificity led to contradictory results in glioma cell
lines27. Differences in these in vitro studies could be attributed to
differences among cancer types or off-target effects of chemical
modulators. This further supports the need for highly selective
pharmacological agents to investigate KCNK9 function and it
highlights the advantage of monoclonal antibody-based targeting.
Indeed, the monoclonal antibody reported here affords the
first demonstration of the oncogenic properties of endogenous
KCNK9
channel
in
vivo
and
we
observed
consistent
tumour-promoting properties in tumour growth and metastasis.
Numerous K þ channels in addition to KCNK9 have been
reported to be differentially expressed in human cancer and
regulate different aspects of tumorigenecity32,33. However, it is
still largely unknown how K þ
ion conductance controls
biological processes. K þ channels, K2P in particular, fine-tune
resting membrane potential to keep it at a generally defined range
of � 30 to � 85 mV. As channels open, the membrane potential
can either become more negative (hyperpolarize) or become
more positive (depolarize), in comparison with the resting
membrane potential. Changes in membrane potential can alter
cell physiology such as cell volume dynamics, which in turn
regulate cell proliferation, adhesion and migration32,33. For
example, calcium (Ca2 þ)-activated K þ channels (KCa) and
inward rectifying K þ channels (Kir) can regulate local cell
volume
to
promote
cancer
cell
invasion31.
In
addition,
maintenance of resting membrane potential is critical to the
function
of
voltage-sensitive
molecules.
For
example,
hyperpolarization caused by opening of K2P channels increases
Ca2 þ influx and regulates G1–S transition during cell cycle
progression34. Membrane potential oscillation may also directly
control cell cycle progression. The expression and function of K þ
channels are known to show cell cycle phase dependence32. A
number of reports indicate that membrane hyperpolarization
accompanied with increased K þ permeability takes place at G1–S
transition and it is required to initiate S phase, whereas
depolarization
prevents
G1–S
transition33,34–36.
Preliminary
cell cycle analysis with BEN cells indicated that KCNK9
expression disproportionally associated with S þ G2/M phases
(Supplementary Fig. 8). As the opening of KCNK9 results in
hyperpolarization, it suggests that increased expression/activity of
KCNK9 promotes cell cycle progression through G1–S. This
would support the findings that KCNK9 targeting by Y4 reduced
proliferative index and decreased tumour burden in vivo. In our
study, by comparing Y4 and H8, we found that the degree of
KCNK9
conductance
inhibition
correlates
with
antibody’s
anti-cancer effect in vivo. In addition, modulation of KCNK9
by Y4 in the absence of immune-dependent factors such as
complement is sufficient to cause profound cytotoxicity in vitro.
These results suggest that KCNK9 is not simply a tumour antigen
but an important regulator of tumour growth. Defining the

 mechanistic network linking K þ
homeostasis and tumour
physiology awaits further studies.
There are multiple mechanisms by which antibodies perturb
channel
function.
Most
antibodies
generated
by
rational
design either occlude the ion permeation pathway or alter
modalities essential for channel gating and their effects often
become apparent within minutes of antibody addition1,37.
Antibody-induced internalization has been reported for several
self-reactive antibodies targeting voltage-gated ion channels in
paraneoplastic channelopathies such as acquired neuromyotonia
and Lambert–Eaton syndrome1. Tumour antigens are thought to
trigger
generation
of
self-reactive
antibodies
to
tumour
cell surface proteins including ion channels. Binding of these
self-reactive antibodies alone is insufficient to significantly
suppress
channel
function.
Instead,
long-time
incubation
(2B24 h) of divalent antibodies is found to induce channel
internalization, which in turn causes neuromuscular transmission
defects38–41. In this study, we found that a minimum of 6 h
incubation was required for Y4 to exert significant inhibition of
KCNK9 conductance. Short-time perfusion of Y4 did not show
detectable
effects
using
our
electrophysiology
set
up.
This supports downregulation of cell surface channel expression
as one mechanism of Y4’s action, although it does not rule out
potential effects on ion permeation and/or gating. An advantage
of antibodies that are capable of inducing internalization
compared with antibodies that act merely as blockers is
that efficacious inhibition depends on the quantity and density
of antigens expressed
on the cell surface.

 mechanism-based specificity such that only tumour cells with
sufficiently high channel expression are targeted by antibodies. It
is possible that targeting a subset of tumour cells can limit
treatment efficacy. However, the fact that Y4 is able to suppress
BEN and LX22 tumour growth, as well as 410.4 metastasis,
despite cell target heterogeneity, supports a balance between
specificity and efficacy. Furthermore, Y4 could have anti-tumour
effects independent of KCNK9 function. For example, it can be
developed into antibody-drug conjugates where it facilitates
tumour-specific delivery of cytotoxic payloads to kill tumour cells.
In our animal models, Y4 treatment did not achieve tumour
regression but rather a reduced growth rate. The effectiveness is
comparable to what was observed in preclinical testing of other
therapeutic antibodies42,43.
Our study serves as a proof-of-concept that ion channels are
targetable by antibodies, and that this approach has therapeutic
promise.
The
strategies
described
here
to
develop
and
characterize antibodies can be applied to other ion channels,
providing
insight
into
the
physiological
and
pathological
significance of this understudied class of membrane proteins.
Methods
Reagents. Antibodies were from the following sources: mouse anti-human growth
hormone antibody (catalogue: ab9821, Abcam, 1:1,000), rabbit anti-KCNK9
antibody (catalogue: APC-044, Alomone, 1:800), goat anti-KCNK9 antibody
(catalogue: sc-11317, Santa Cruz, 1:1,000), mouse anti-b-actin antibody (catalogue:
ab8227, Abcam, 1:5,000), rabbit anti-cleaved caspase-3 (catalogue: 9664, Cell
Signaling, 1:1,000), rabbit anti-Ki67 antibodies (catalogue: ab15580, Abcam,
1:1,000) and APC-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibody (catalogue: 405308,
Biolegend, 1:100). Isotype matched mouse IgG1 (mIgG1) control was from
SouthernBiotech (catalogue: 0107-01). Anti-KCNK9 monoclonal antibodies
were isotyped using Rapid ELISA Mouse mAb Isotyping Kit (Pierce). Transient
transfection of K2P channels was performed using Fugene6 (Promega).
Cell culture. HEK293, COS-7, BEN lung carcinoma cells (DSMZ, Germany) and
MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells (gift from Dr Sara Sukumar) were grown in
DMEM medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 2 mM
L-Glutamine (L-Gln). HEK293-KCNK9 stable cell lines were previously generated8
and KCNK9 expression was induced by incubation with 1 mM tetracycline for 16 h.
These cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 2 mM L-Gln,
400 mg ml � 1 hygromycin and 15 mg ml � 1 blasticidin. BT-549 breast cancer cells
(gift from Dr Sara Sukumar) were maintained in RPMI-1640 medium
supplemented with 10% FBS and 2 mM L-Gln. Syngeneic 410 (non-metastatic) and
410.4 (metastatic) murine breast cancer cells were expanded from Fulton lab stocks
and cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 2 mM L-Gln, 0.15% w/v
sodium bicarbonate and 100 mM MEM non-essential amino acids as previously
described44. LX22 cells (patient derived by Dr Christine L. Hann) were maintained
in R10 medium—RPMI1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 2 mM L-Gln,
100 mg ml � 1 penicillin/streptavidin and 20 mM HEPES. All cells were maintained
at 37 �C in 5% CO2. None of the cell lines used is listed in the International Cell
Line Authentication Committee list of misidentified cancer cell lines and all cell
lines were mycoplasma negative.
Antibody generation and purification. Murine monoclonal antibodies were
generated against the first extracellular domain (M1P1 loop) of hKCNK9
(amino acids 30B88) expressed recombinantly in mammalian expression vectors
and subsequently affinity purified for immunization45,46. Y-mAbs were generated
by immunizing female, 12-week-old NZB X NZW (B/W) F1 mice and H-mAbs
were generated in female, 12-week-old BALB/c mice (Jackson Laboratory).
Multiple rounds of limiting dilution cloning were performed and culture
supernatants from hybridomas were screened by enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assays (ELISA). Clones with high ELISA titres were chosen for secondary screen by
flow cytometry. Selected single clones were scaled up and monoclonal antibodies
were purified using protein G agarose beads (Pierce) following the manufacturer’s
recommendations.
RNA isolation and quantitative real-time PCR. Total RNA from cell lines and
snap-frozen tumour tissues was extracted using RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) and
quantitative reverse transcriptase–PCR was performed as described previously47.
Relative expression of each gene was normalized to human18S rRNA or mouse
glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase RNA. Sequences of primer pairs were
listed in Supplementary Table 1.
Western blot analysis. Protein extraction and western blotting were performed as
described previously48. Briefly, total protein was extracted using radioimmuno-
precipitation assay buffer (1% Igepal, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate and 0.1% SDS in
PBS) with 1 � protease and 1 � phosphatase inhibitors (Calbiochem). Aliquots of
50mg of total protein were loaded and separated by 4–12% SDS–PAGE (Lonza).
For immunoblot analyses, proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane
(GE Healthcare) by wet blotting at 30B35 V overnight at 4 �C. Membranes were
incubated for 1 h in Odyssey Licor Blocking Buffer at room temperature and then
overnight with primary antibodies at 4 �C. Membranes were then washed 3 � with
Tris-buffered saline (TBS) with 0.1% Tween, incubated with secondary antibody at
1:10,000 for 1 h, washed 3 � with TBS with 0.1% Tween, followed by washing
2 � with TBS. Proteins were detected and quantified using the Odyssey Infrared
Imager (LI-COR Biosciences). Relative expression was normalized to actin.
Flow cytometry analysis. Single-cell suspensions were labelled with anti-KCNK9
monoclonal antibodies for 30 min at 4 �C. After washing with ice-cold PBS, cells
were incubated with APC-conjugated goat anti-mIgG secondary antibody for
30 min at 4 �C. APC signal indicates KCNK9 expression and detection by KCNK9
antibodies. Cell staining was analysed using FACS Calibur flow cytometer (BD
Biosciences) or sorted using FACS Aria-II flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). For
transient transfection experiments, cells were co-transfected with GFP as trans-
fection control. Flow cytometry analysis was performed on gated GFP positive cells.
Antibody-binding characterization. Monoclonal antibody specificity was
examined based on cross-reactivity to nine recombinant hK2PM1P1 subtypes in
western blottings and further verified by flow cytometry analysis of cells transiently
transfected with hKCNK9 and its most closely related K2P subtype hKCNK3.
Affinity of binding to recombinant human and murine KCNK9M1P1 was
determined using Octet system (Pall Life Sciences). Association and dissociation
rates were measured in real time by incubating probes coated with Y-mAbs in the
presence of hGH-hK9M1P1 or hGH-mK9M1P1 recombinant protein. KD was
estimated by deriving association (Kon) and dissociation (Koff) constants from
real-time measurement and calculated by: KD ¼ Kon/Koff.
Tl þ-based fluorescence assay. A fluorescence assay previously developed for
chemical screen of KCNK9 modulators was adapted for monoclonal antibodies8,15.
In this assay, Tl þ served as a surrogate ion for K þ. Upon tetracycline induction of
KCNK9 expression, cells were incubated with 0.4 mg ml � 1 monoclonal antibodies
for 0.5–72 h at 37 �C. After wash-off, cells were loaded with a Tl þ-sensitive
fluorescent dye FluxOR (Invitrogen). Upon channel activation by 2.8 mM K þ, Tl þ
influx yielded a fluorescence change monitored as function of time8. Parental
HEK293 and non-induced KCNK9 cells were negative controls.
Flow cytometry analysis of channel internalization. Tetracycline-induced
KCNK9/HEK293 or BEN cells were incubated with 0.4 mg ml � 1 Y-mAbs for 36 h
at 30 �C, to induce endocytosis. KCNK9 channels remained on the plasma mem-
brane were stained with a polyclonal anti-KCNK9 antibody followed by secondary
antibody staining and flow cytometry analysis. The extent of cell surface KCNK9
reduction was quantified in two ways as follows: (1) the difference in the percentage
of KCNK9-positive cells and (2) the difference in the overall fluorescence in
KCNK9-positive cells by integrating fluorescence intensity and event count,
reflecting the shift in the composite fluorescence intensity of KCNK9-positive cells.
Confocal microscopic analysis of channel internalization. Y4 was labelled with
Alexa Fluor 488 dye (Life Technologies). COS-7 cells were transiently transfected
with hKCNK9 or hKCNK3 and mcherry was co-transfected as a transfection
control. After 36 h, cells were treated with 0.4 mg ml � 1 Y4 either for 3 h at 4 �C or
for 12 h at 30 �C. At the end of incubation, cells were washed with PBS, fixed with
4% paraformaldehyde, washed with PBS and mounted with ProLong Gold Anti-
fade Mountant containing 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Life Technologies).
Images were taken at � 63/1.4 with scan zoom 1.0. For co-localization analysis,
COS-7 cells were co-transfected with red fluorescent protein-tagged EEA1
(Addgene). Images were taken at � 40/1.3 with scan zoom 1.0 and quantified using
Imaris software (Bitplane). A minimum threshold of red and green channels was
selected. The data represent images taken from 20 different areas (n ¼ 20).
Cell viability and cell death assay. Cancer cell lines were seeded in 10% heat-
inactivated FBS culture medium overnight at 37 �C. Next day, cells were washed
with PBS and treated with 0.4 mg ml � 1 antibodies in 0.1 or 10% heat-inactivated
FBS culture medium for 24–72 h at 37 �C. Cell viability was measured using Cell
Counting Kit-8 (Dojindo Molecular Technologies). Cell death was determined by
measuring LDH release using CytoTox 96 Non-Radioactive Cytotoxicity Assay
(Promega) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Complement-dependent cytotoxicity. CDC assay protocol was adapted from
previous studies49,50. Cancer cell lines were treated with 0.4 mg ml � 1 antibodies
with or without murine serum complement (Rockland) for 2 h at 37 �C.

 Lyophilized complement sera from mouse was reconstituted in PBS and serially
diluted 1:10 to 1:1,000. Heat inactivation was performed by 30-min incubation at
56 �C. Cell death was determined as LDH release.
ADCC assay. ADCC assay was performed following the manufacturer’s
recommendations26. Briefly, BEN target cells were seeded the day before the assay.
Y4 and mIgG1 were titrated with a maximal concentration of 100 mg ml � 1, added
to BEN cells and incubated for 30 min at 37 �C. Murine Jurkat NFAT-luc þ
FcgRIIIa cell line was used as effector cells and seeded at a ratio of Jurkat:BEN 6:1.
Co-culture was incubated for 6 h at 37 �C. Luciferase induction was measured as a
readout of ADCC using Bio-Glo Luciferase assay reagent and a Tecan plate reader.
Xenograft studies. Female, 6- to 8-week-old nu/nu or NSG mice (Charles River)
were anaesthetized by i.p. injection of 5 mg kg � 1 xylazine. Mice received 4 � 106
viable BEN cells or 1 � 106 viable LX22 cells (freshly dissociated from tumour
xenograft) in 25 ml PBS and 25 ml Matrigel (Corning) subcutaneously in the dorsal
flank. To monitor monoclonal antibodies’ effects on tumour initiation, mice were
randomly divided into two groups and received 4 mg kg � 1 mIgG1 or Y4 in 100 ml
PBS i.p. starting on day 0 followed by antibody injection twice a week. To monitor
monoclonal antibodies’ effects on tumour regression, after tumours reached
50 mm3, mice were randomly divided into two groups and received 4 mg kg � 1
mIgG1 or Y4 in 100 ml PBS i.p. twice a week. Tumour volumes were estimated by
measuring two dimensions (length (a) and width (b)) and calculated using the
equation: V ¼ ab2/2 as described previously47. Maximum tumour volume
permitted was 2,500 mm3. All mice were used in accordance with guidelines from
the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine Animal Care Committee.
Immunohistochemistry. Cryostat sections were stained with anti-cleaved
caspase-3 and anti-Ki67 antibodies, and counterstained with Methyl Green as
previously described48. Proliferation and apoptotic indices were determined by
computer-assisted quantification using ImageJ Software (rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/) as
previously reported48.
Metastasis studies. Female, 4- to 6-week-old Balb/cByJ mice (Jackson
Laboratory) were randomly divided into two groups and primed by receiving
4 mg kg � 1 mIgG1 or Y4 in 100 ml PBS i.p. twice a week for 1 week before cell
injection. Viable 410.4 cells (2 � 105) were injected intravenously into the lateral
tail vein of mice, which were then treated with 4 mg kg � 1 mIgG1 or Y4 in 100 ml
PBS i.p. twice a week. All mice were killed on day 25 posttransplantation or earlier
if moribund. Lungs were examined for surface tumour colonies under a dissecting
microscope. All mice were used in accordance with guidelines from the University
of Maryland Institutional Animal Care Committee.
Cell cycle analysis. KCNK9 channels on BEN cell surfaces were labelled with Y4
and secondary antibody as described in previous section. Cells were then fixed and
permeablized with 80% ethanol followed by propidium iodide staining. During
flow cytometry analysis, K9 þ and K9 � cells were gated and their corresponding
propidium iodide signal was collected for analysis.
Statistical analysis. Two group comparisons were analysed by two-tailed
Student’s t-test or analysis of variance. Po0.05 was considered significant and
all data shown are mean±s.d. unless otherwise stated. Statistical analysis of
co-localization was performed by calculating Pearson’s coefficient of correlation
between green and red channels. r40.5 was considered significant.
