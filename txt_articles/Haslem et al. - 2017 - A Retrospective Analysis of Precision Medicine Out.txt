QUESTION ASKED: What are the clinical outcomes and health care–associated costs in patients
with advanced cancer who receive precision cancer medicine?
SUMMARY ANSWER: Patients who received precision cancer medicine experienced an
improved progression-free survival (PFS; 22.9 weeks) compared with historical controls (12.0 weeks)
who received standard treatments. The improved PFS was not associated with increased health
care–associated costs.
WHAT WE DID: We conducted a matched cohort study of 72 patients with metastatic cancer of
diverse subtypes. We analyzed the outcomes of 36 patients who received genomic testing and
targeted therapy (precision cancer medicine) compared with 36 historical control patients who
received standard chemotherapy (n = 29) or best supportive care (n = 7).
WHAT WE FOUND: The average PFS was 22.9 weeks for the precision medicine group and
12.0 weeks for the control group (P = .002) with a hazard ratio of 0.47 (95% CI, 0.29 to 0.75) when
matching on age, sex, histologic diagnosis, and previous lines of treatment. In a subset analysis of
patients who received all care within the Intermountain Healthcare system (n = 44), per patient
charges were $4,665 per week in the precision treatment group and $5,000 per week in the control
group (P = .126).
BIAS, CONFOUNDING FACTORS: The retrospective nature of the control cohort, in particular,
raisesthepossibilityofbiasintheanalysis.Controllingforthenumber ofpreviouslinesoftreatment
that a patient received before enrolling in the study serves to mitigate the risk of bias but does not
completely eliminate the possibility. A statistical sensitivity analysis, included in the Appendix,
affirms that a difference in performance status between the two cohorts was unlikely to account for
the difference in PFS.
REAL-LIFE IMPLICATIONS: A major question surrounding the implementation of precision
cancer medicine is its relevance in the community setting. Developing a model for the clinical
implementationofprecisionmedicineinacommunitysettingisanecessarystepindeterminingwhether
this approach warrants further consideration as a viable option for patients with advanced cancer. The
survival and cost outcomes reported here were generated in an integrated health care delivery system
with patients receiving treatment in a community cancer center and suggest that precision cancer
medicine can be applied to the community setting with measurable patient benefit.

Abstract
Purpose
The advent of genomic diagnostic technologies such as next-generation sequencing has
recently enabled the use of genomic information to guide targeted treatment in patients
with cancer, an approach known as precision medicine. However, clinical outcomes,
including survival and the cost of health care associated with precision cancer medicine,
have been challenging to measure and remain largely unreported.
Patients and Methods
We conducted a matched cohort study of 72 patients with metastatic cancer of diverse
subtypes in the setting of a large, integrated health care delivery system. We analyzed
the outcomes of 36 patients who received genomic testing and targeted therapy
(precision cancer medicine) between July 1, 2013, and January 31, 2015, compared with
36 historical control patients who received standard chemotherapy (n = 29) or best
supportive care (n = 7).
Results
The average progression-free survival was 22.9 weeks for the precision medicine
group and 12.0 weeks for the control group (P = .002) with a hazard ratio of 0.47
(95% CI, 0.29 to 0.75) when matching on age, sex, histologic diagnosis, and previous
lines of treatment. In a subset analysis of patients who received all care within the
Intermountain Healthcare system (n = 44), per patient charges per week were $4,665
in the precision treatment group and $5,000 in the control group (P = .126).
Conclusion
These findings suggest that precision cancer medicine may improve survival for patients
with refractory cancer without increasing health care costs. Although the results of
this study warrant further validation, this precision medicine approach may be a viable
option for patients with advanced cancer.

 INTRODUCTION
Precision cancer medicine involves the detection of tumor-
specific somatic mutations, including insertions/deletions
(indels), single nucleotide variants, translocations, and copy
number alterations, followed by treatment with therapeutics
thatspecificallytargetidentifiedactionablealterations.1-7 This
approach usingprecision medicine haslargely been hampered
by the high cost of testing and the extended turnaround times
associatedwithin-depthgenomicdiagnosticanalysis.However,
advances in genomic technologies, including next-generation
sequencing (NGS) and droplet digital polymerase chain re-
action, have now rendered extended genomic analyses of
human malignancies technologically and financially feasible
for use in the clinic.8-10
Concomitantwiththeseadvancesingenomictechnologies,
there have been significant advances in two overlapping areas
of cancer research, each with major clinical ramifications; the
first is a greater understanding of the underlying genomic
alterations and molecular mechanisms of cancer, and the second
is development of novel therapeutic agents and biomolecules
that exploit specific genomic aberrations in tumors.11-16 These
advances are the underpinnings of the new precision cancer
medicine clinical paradigm.17
Intheprecisionmedicineapproachtocancer,thephysician
andpatientusetheidentificationofspecificgeneticaberrations
that affect cancer-related genes to better inform treatment
decisions. The underlying rationale is that this personalized
diagnosticapproachwillleadtoaclinicalrecommendationfor
targeted cancer therapies that will ultimately result in im-
provedclinical outcomes. Thisapproachhasbeen successfully
applied to single tumor types with predetermined genomic
variants such as EGFR-positive non–small-cell lung cancer
(NSCLC)18-20 and BRAF-positive melanoma,14,21,22 whereas
previousstudiesrevealedthatprecisionmedicinecanimprove
survival in a single cancer type.23 Earlier studies indicated that
targeted therapies given to patients whose tumors harbored
specific alterations may improve outcomes as measured by
tumor responsiveness.24 However, the impact of precision
medicine compared with standard therapies on survival and
the effect of implementing sophisticated diagnostic tech-
nologies such as NGS on the costs of cancer care, remain
unknown.
Our precision cancer medicine program was clinically
established in a single region of the Intermountain Healthcare
delivery system. Patients with advanced, refractory cancer
were referred to the precision medicine clinic where they
received genomic testing, an in-depth interpretation of the
genomic results from a multi-institutional molecular tumor
board,andalistoftreatmentoptionsforimplementationatthe
discretion of the treating oncologist.
We report here the progression-free survival (PFS), total
costs, and cost per week of survival associated with the initial
cohort of patients who received targeted treatment in the
precision cancer medicine program compared with control
patients who received standard chemotherapy or best sup-
portive care.
PATIENTS AND METHODS
The Intermountain Healthcare Institutional Review Board
approved this study, and all living participants provided
written informed consent before enrollment. The Board
granted a waiver of consent for decedents.
Study Design
Research objectives
The objective of this retrospective observational study was
to compare the outcomes of patients with cancer who were
treated with precision cancer targeted therapies with a his-
torical control cohort treated with a nontargeted approach.
Research subjects
Male and female adults with measurable recurrent/metastatic
solid tumors for whom standard first-line treatments (pro-
posed by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network
[NCCN] guidelines) failed were included in this study. Other
inclusion requirements were Eastern Cooperative Oncology
Group performance status of 0, 1, or 2 and adequate renal,
hepatic, and bone marrow function. Patients who had only
brain metastases or whose brain metastases had not been
controlledfor.3monthsandpatientswhowereparticipating
in a clinical trial with an experimental drug were excluded.
Pregnant or breastfeeding women also were excluded.
All patients in the precision medicine group had tumor
molecular abnormalities for which the Intermountain Health-
care Multi-Institutional Molecular Tumor Board (MTB) pro-
vided an interpretation. Actionable mutations were defined as
variants that had been validated in the peer-reviewed literature
and for which a targeted therapy was available. The MTB
selected treatment options only for actionable mutations for
which there was published clinical or preclinical evidence.
Patients included in the control group received standard-
of-care genomic testing only, without interpretation by the

 MTB or molecularly targeted therapy beyond the relevant
standard of care.
Sample size
A simulation power analysis was performed for a Cox pro-
portional hazards model with 100,000 simulations. In de-
terminingthesamplesizethatweusedforstudy,weconsidered
the methodology of Tsimberidou et al.24
Selection of end points
The primary end point was PFS according to radiographic
determination of tumor progression and Response Evaluation
Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1. Tumor measurements
by computed tomography imaging were obtained before
treatment was initiated and every 8 weeks thereafter. Second-
ary end points included health care–associated cost of care.
Blinding
Clinician researchers were blinded to the identities of those
in the control cohort. Cancer registrars selected the control
cohort and provided data about the controls to the study
statistician (A.M.B.).
Statistical Methods
A Cox proportional hazards model was fit for PFS. Treatment,
sex,age,cancertype,andthreeormorelinesoftreatmentwere
included in this model. A full likelihood ratio versus a reduced
likelihood ratio test was performed comparing the full model
to a reduced model containing only treatment. This test
showed that the reduced model adequately fits the data, and
only treatment is needed in the model (P = .508). Basic de-
mographics as well as two-sample t tests and linear regression
models were created to investigate the cost of therapy. Col-
lecting demographic variables and using the Cox model
controlled for confounding factors.
Cost Analysis
In calculating patient costs, a payer perspective was adopted.
Patient costs were estimated by using standard Intermountain
Healthcare payer charges. Only charges incurred between
the treatment line start and end dates were included in the
totalchargeestimatesforeachpatient.Patientcostsincluded
all amounts for patient treatment, toxicity, patient sequenc-
ing, and targeted drug therapy. Treatment costs for both
targeted and control patients included all facility-based and
clinic-based charges associated with treatment, including
chemotherapy,drug,radiology,andlaboratorycosts.Palliative
care costs were limited to daily reimbursement charge rates
determined by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Ser-
vices. Toxicity costs included all patient charges associated
with treating the adverse effects resulting from treatment.
Sequencingcostsfortargetpatientswereobtainedfromthetest
providerandwerebaseduponestimatedpayerreimbursement
rates. Drug cost data were drawn from local specialty phar-
macies and drug manufacturers and were based upon esti-
mated payer reimbursement rates, including estimates of any
out-of-pocket costs for the patient. A discount rate was not
appliedtocoststoadjustforthetimevalueofmoney.Giventhe
limited availability of quality-of-life data for control patients,
PFSweekswerenotqualityadjusted.Themeanperpatientcost
per PFS week was calculated by adding the costs per PFS week
for each patient and dividing by the total number of patients.
Statistical comparisons of costs between precision medicine
and control groups were performed by using a two-sided
Wilcoxon rank sum test.

All samples analyzed were either formalin-fixed paraffin-
embedded (FFPE) or fresh. Patient samples were analyzed

 preparation, library preparation, and NGS were performed
by using the TOMAseq kit (adaptor, extension, and capture
sets; TOMA Biosciences, Foster City, CA) according to the
manufacturer’s protocol and instructions. Library quantifi-
cation was performed with a Bio-Rad q200 droplet digital
polymerase chain reaction analyzer (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA).
Sequencing was performed on the MiSeq platform (Illumina,
San Diego, CA). Data analysis, including curation, in-
terpretation,alignment,andqualitycheckswereimplemented
by using legacy algorithms, and the variant calling was done
using Freebayes. Patient samples were compared with a ref-
erence genome, and genetic variants, including copy number
alterations, point mutations, frameshift mutations, transloca-
tions, and single nucleotide polymorphisms, were identified
and reported. Some samples were initially tested by an ex-
ternal laboratory (Caris Biosciences, Foundation Medicine,
or TOMA Biosciences), and those with sufficient quantity
were subsequently reanalyzed by using the 96-gene panel
described previously.
RESULTS
After obtaining informed consent, we evaluated 61 patients
who had an actionable mutation and who subsequently re-
ceivedtargetedtherapyonthebasisoftheactionablemutation
(precision cancer medicine), defined as known variants vali-
dated in peer-reviewed literature for which a targeted therapy
wasavailable.Giventheheterogeneousnatureofthetreatment
cohort in terms of tumor type, age, and sex, we sought to
comparetheiroutcomes withtheoutcomesof controlpatients
who were matched to treatment patients according to tumor
type, age, sex, and number of previous lines of treatment. We
searched our institutional enterprise data warehouse to
identify historical control patients who had received standard
therapy between July 2010 and January 2015 and who could
be matched according to age, sex, diagnosis, and number of
previous lines of treatment with patients who received pre-
cision medicine (Fig 1). Of the 61 patients with an actionable
mutation who had received precision medicine, 36 had an
institutional historical match (25 patients did not have a
historical match). We gathered outcomes data from those 36
patients who received precision medicine and the 36 matched
patients who received standard therapy, including standard
molecular testing, for a total of 72 patients (Fig 1). Table 1 lists
patients’ demographic characteristics by treatment type. No
significantdifferenceswerefoundbetweenprecisionmedicine
and standard therapy groups except for race/ethnicity,
which was 100% (n = 36) non-Hispanic white in the precision
medicine arm and was 83.3% (n = 30) non-Hispanic white in
thecontrolarm,with2.8%(n=1)non-Hispanicblack,11.1%
(n = 4) white and nonwhite Hispanic, and 2.8% (n = 1) other
race/ethnicity. Mean age at time of treatment was 67.8 years
for the precision medicine group and 67.0 years for the control
group (P = .748). Both groups were 61% male (n = 44). Four
precision medicine patients were matched at a later line than
their controls resulting in average lines of treatment of 3.1 for
the precision medicine group and 2.9 for the control group
(P = .168). The cancer types were identically matched for both
groups and were comprised of patients with diverse solid

(online only). Patients in the historical control cohort had
appropriate standard molecular testing according to NCCN
guidelines at the time of their diagnosis. Three patients in
the precision medicine cohort with NSCLC were found to
harbor validated EGFR mutations, and they received erlotinib
(Table A1); the EGFR mutations were not identified at the
time of initial diagnosis. Five patients with breast cancer (with
hormone-negative [triple negative, n = 2] or hormone re-
fractory [n = 3] disease) who received a targeted therapy after
MTB interpretation, were included in the analysis.
The protocol-specified primary end point of PFS was
significantly prolonged in the precision medicine group
(Fig 2) compared with the control group (mean PFS, 22.9 v
12.0weeks,respectively;P=.002). Morespecifically,precision
medicine was associated with a 53% decreased risk of pro-
gression (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.47; 95% CI, 0.29 to 0.75;
P = .002) when adjusted for age, sex, histologic diagnosis, and
number of previous lines of treatment. At the time of study
conclusion, four patients (11%) in the precision medicine arm
had not yet progressed (Fig 2). A sensitivity analysis suggested
that a difference in patient performance status between the
two cohorts was unlikely to account for the difference in PFS
(Appendix Fig A1, online only). The cohort of 25 patients who
did not have a historical institutional match also demon-
strated a prolonged PFS compared with the control cohort
(19.3 weeks; P = .026).
To determine the costs associated with the two treatment
approaches, we performed a health care–related cost analysis.
We evaluated all of the patients from each cohort and
identified 22 matched patient pairs who had received all of
their care within the Intermountain Healthcare system and
therefore had complete cost data available (Fig 1). An analysis
of PFS in this subset of 22 matched patient pairs revealed the
same statistically significant PFS improvement in the pre-
cision medicine cohort compared with the standard therapy
cohort (21.4 v 11.0 weeks; P = .004; Table 2). Asexpected, total
costs per patient during the study period were higher for the
precision medicine treatment group than the control group
($91,790 v $40,782 per patient; P = .002; Table 2). Drug costs
were the main factor contributing to the higher cost for
precision medicine patients ($59,259 v $20,189 per patient;
P , .001; Table 2). Patients in the precision medicine group
had longer survival times resulting in lower patient costs per
PFS week than the control group ($4,665 v $5,000 per week;
P = .126) but did not reach a level of significance (Table 2).
DISCUSSION
The findings presented here examine survival and the health
care–related costs associated with precision cancer medicine
in a retrospective cohort of patients. The results suggest a
survival benefit for patients who received precision cancer
medicine treatment compared with patients who received
standard therapy, although the potential contribution of the

 tumor’s molecular composition to the resulting prolongation
in PFS could not be assessed, given that the control cohort
tumors did not undergo genomic analysis. A subset analysis
of patients who received all care within the Intermountain
Healthcare system determined that the costs associated with
each cohort were not associated with a per week increase in
health care costs. The simultaneous improvement in PFS,
without increasing per week costs, suggests that a precision
medicine approach may be a feasible option in patients with
refractory cancer.
In a previous study, Tsimberidou et al24 evaluated the
outcomes associated with a phase I personalized medicine
program and found that patients who received therapy on the
basis of specific molecular alterations, independent of tumor
type, experienced improved survival. Similarly, Kris et al23
reported improved survival in patients with lung cancer when
selecting therapies on the basis of oncogenic driver mutations.
Although this study, along with those reported by Tsimber-
idou et al and Kris et al were not randomized trials, they
nevertheless suggest that molecularly guided therapies may
improve survival in patients with advanced refractory cancer.
Although the improvement in PFS identified in this study
partially results from identifying and treating previously
known molecularly distinct cancer subtypes such as EGFR-
positive lung cancer (n = 3 in the targeted treatment cohort),
the majority (n = 33) of cases resulted from targeting distinct
molecular alterations in diverse tumor types, regardless of
histologic subtype. Many of the durable responses were the
result of identifying well-known molecular alterations from a
single cancer subtype, such as an activating c-KIT mutation
commonly found in gastrointestinal stromal tumor, and tar-
getingthatalterationinahistologicallydifferentcancersuchas
melanoma. Similar responses were seen in FGFR1-amplified
squamous cell lung cancer, FGFR2-mutant cholangiocarcinoma,
and MEK1-activated NSCLC. Although similar responses in

Precision Medicine Improves Survival Without Increasing Costs
 sharing.17 The cost associated with precision cancer medicine
remains a primary question for both payers and providers
alike. We attempted to address that question by analyzing the
costs associated with both study cohorts. The overall costs of
treatment, including cost of testing and cost of drug, were
higher in the precision medicine cohort, as might be ex-
pected in a cohort that experiences an increased survival time.
Evaluating the two cohorts on a cost-per-week basis revealed
that the two groups were not statistically different, and drug-
related costs remained the primary driver of charges for both
cohorts. In an era of increasing health care costs and static
resources, measuring the value of treatment becomes critical
to sustainability. Although the costs of large-scale genomic
testing have historically precluded widespread adoption of
precision medicine, the equivalence in cost per PFS week
between the two cohorts suggests that widespread adoption of
precision cancer medicine may no longer be constrained by
economic metrics.
A major question surrounding the implementation of
precision cancer medicine is its relevance in the community
setting in which nearly 85% of patients with cancer treated in
theUnitedStatesreceivetheircare.Developingamodelforthe
clinicalimplementationofprecisionmedicineinacommunity
setting, therefore, is a necessary step in determining whether
thisapproachwarrantsfurtherconsiderationasaviableoption
for the vast majority of patients with advanced cancer. The
survival and cost outcomes reported here were generated en-
tirely in an integrated health care delivery system with pa-
tients receiving treatment in a community cancer center and
suggest that precision cancer medicine can be applied to the
community setting with measurable patient benefit.

FIG A1. Statistical sensitivity analysis of performance status (PS) on progression-free survival (PFS). Hazard ratios and 95% CIs were calculated for conditions in
which the difference in performance status between precision medicine and control cohorts was large (delta = –2.5) or small (delta = 0). Gamma (0 to 3)
representsthe relative hazardof deathfor unmeasured performance status. Hazard ratios in green representconditions in which targetedtreatmentcauses an
increase in PFS. Hazard ratios in black represent conditions in which targeted treatment neither increases nor decreases PFS significantly. Hazard ratios in red
represent conditions in which targeted treatment causes a decrease in PFS.
