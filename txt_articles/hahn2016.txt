Abstract
Aedes (Stegomyia) aegypti (L.) and Aedes (Stegomyia) albopictus (Skuse) transmit arboviruses that are increas-
ing threats to human health in the Americas, particularly dengue, chikungunya, and Zika viruses. Epidemics of
the associated arboviral diseases have been limited to South and Central America, Mexico, and the Caribbean
in the Western Hemisphere, with only minor localized outbreaks in the United States. Nevertheless, accurate
and up-to-date information for the geographical ranges of Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus in the United States is
urgently needed to guide surveillance and enhance control capacity for these mosquitoes. We compiled county
records for presence of Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus in the United States from 1995-2016, presented here in
map format. Records were derived from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ArboNET database,
VectorMap, the published literature, and a survey of mosquito control agencies, university researchers, and
state and local health departments. Between January 1995 and March 2016, 183 counties from 26 states and the
District of Columbia reported occurrence of Ae. aegypti, and 1,241 counties from 40 states and the District of
Columbia reported occurrence of Ae. albopictus. During the same time period, Ae. aegypti was collected in 3 or
more years from 94 counties from 14 states and the District of Columbia, and Ae. albopictus was collected dur-
ing 3 or more years from 514 counties in 34 states and the District of Columbia. Our findings underscore the
need for systematic surveillance of Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus in the United States and delineate areas with
risk for the transmission of these introduced arboviruses.

Arboviruses transmitted by the yellow fever mosquito, Aedes
(Stegomyia) aegypti (L.), and the Asian tiger mosquito, Aedes
(Stegomyia) albopictus (Skuse), are increasing threats to human
health in the Americas. The re-emergence of dengue viruses in the
Western Hemisphere during the 1980s and 1990s was followed by
the emergence of chikungunya virus in 2013 and Zika virus in 2015
(Brathwaite et al. 2012, Weaver and Forrester 2015, Zanluca et al.
2015). Epidemics of dengue, chikungunya, and now Zika have
swept through or are sweeping through South America, Central
America, Mexico, and the Caribbean (San Mart�
ın et al. 2010,
Johansson et al. 2014, Hennessey et al. 2016). Yellow fever virus re-
mains a concern with sporadic yellow fever outbreaks in South
America (Barrett and Higgs 2007, Gardner and Ryman 2010).
Both Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus are established in the United
States (Darsie and Ward 2005, Kraemer et al. 2015). Aedes aegypti
most likely has been present, permanently or intermittently, in the
southeastern United States since the 17th century and is the sus-
pected vector of the yellow fever and dengue outbreaks that oc-
curred in the eastern part of the country from 1650 to the early 20th
century (Eisen and Moore 2013). A multi-state survey in 1964
showed this mosquito to still be present in 203 counties across 10
states in the Southeast (Morlan and Tinker 1965). Recently, Ae.
aegypti has become established in the Southwest, including Arizona
and California, and is sporadically reported from Mid-Atlantic
states and Washington, D.C. (Eisen and Moore 2013, Kraemer et al.
2015, Porse et al. 2015, Lima et al. 2016). The first established pop-
ulation of Ae. albopictus in the continental United States was re-
corded from Texas in 1985 (Sprenger and Wuithiranyagool 1986).
The mosquito thereafter spread rapidly across the Southeast to later
reach the southern portions of the Northeast and Upper Midwest as
well as the Pacific Coast (Moore 1999, Kraemer et al. 2015, Porse
et al. 2015). Both mosquito species are at the northern limits of their

 geographical ranges in the continental United States, but the range
of Ae. albopictus is much broader; it exists as both tropical and tem-
perate populations (Nawrocki and Hawley 1987), and it is capable
of establishing overwintering populations farther north compared
with Ae. aegypti (Darsie and Ward 2005, Kraemer et al. 2015).
The emerging threats of dengue, chikungunya, and Zika virus
diseases have highlighted the need for accurate and up-to-date re-
cords for the geographical ranges of Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus
to guide ongoing efforts to strengthen mosquito surveillance and
control capacity (World Health Organization 2009, PAHO / CDC
2011), and to serve as the basis for model-based predictions of fu-
ture spread of these important arbovirus vectors. We therefore have
compiled county records for presence of Ae. aegypti and Ae. albo-
pictus in the United States from 1995 to 2016. These data were used
to develop contemporary county-scale distribution maps of each
species.
Materials and Methods
Selection of Time Period and Criteria for Mosquito
Presence Classifications
We included collection records from 1995 to the present (March
2016, henceforth referred to as 2016) from several primary and sec-
ondary data sources to identify counties that have reported contem-
porary collections of Ae. aegypti or Ae. albopictus and thus likely
represent the current distributions of these mosquitoes. Aedes
aegypti or Ae. albopictus was considered “present” in a county in a
given calendar year if at least one specimen of any life stage of the
mosquito was collected, using any collection method, during that
year. We further classified counties with reported Ae. aegypti or Ae.
albopictus based on whether a species was collected in 1, 2, or 3 or
more years, with no distinction of whether or not collection years
were consecutive. This was done to distinguish between counties in
which Ae. aegypti or Ae. albopictus were collected in a single year
and counties where these mosquito species have been reported in
multiple years between 1995 and 2016, indicating either established
populations or introduction of the species in more than one year. A
county was classified as having “no reported records” for a species
if there were no collection records for that species between 1995
and 2016. However, a classification of no reported records for a
county should not necessarily be interpreted as the given species
being absent in that county.
Compilation of Preexisting Collection Records
We extracted records for reported occurrence of Ae. aegypti or Ae.
albopictus between 2000 and 2015 in the United States from the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) ArboNET sur-
veillance system database, which was established in 2000 following
the introduction of West Nile virus to the United States in 1999
(Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2014). Additional mos-
quito surveillance records for 2015 may be entered into the surveil-
lance system for the next few weeks, as the 2015 data are still
provisional, but we extracted all available records for 2015 that
were in the database as of 10 March 2016. ArboNET is the national
surveillance database maintained by the CDC for nationally notifi-
able arboviral diseases. In addition to human cases of arboviral dis-
ease, state health departments can voluntarily report data for virus
infection in birds and domestic animals and for collected and/or
tested mosquitoes. The ArboNET records for mosquitoes include
the county and date of collection. We also extracted collection re-
cords for Ae. aegypti or Ae. albopictus between 1995 and 1 March
2016 from VectorMap, an open-source, online database of global
geo-referenced mosquito collection records managed by the Walter
Reed Biosystematics Unit in the Smithsonian Institution (Foley et al.
2016). In addition, we extracted collection records between 1995
and 2014 in the United States from Kraemer et al. (2015). Kraemer
et al. (2015) presented a global compendium of Ae. aegypti and Ae.
albopictus records from 1960 to 2014 from peer-reviewed literature
and unpublished sources such as national entomological surveys and
expert networks.
We also performed literature searches in PubMed and Scopus us-
ing the search terms “Aedes aegypti” or “Aedes albopictus” or
“Stegomyia” and “United States” between 1 January 2013 and 7
March 2016 to identify collection records that were too recent to be
included by Kraemer et al. (2015). We limited the language to
English. Records were included in our database if the descriptions of
collection location and time period in the article allowed for deter-
mination of county and year of collection and if that collection year
was in 1995 or later. Full references for each published record in the
final database are included in Supplementary Tables 1 and 2.
Survey for Additional Collection Records
We also designed an online survey, using GoogleForms, to compile
additional county-level collection records for Ae. aegypti and Ae.
albopictus in the United States between 2000 and 2016, correspond-
ing to the time period data were captured in ArboNET. The survey
was designed to capture contemporary surveillance records from
vector control districts, university researchers, and local health de-
partments that were not submitted to ArboNET, which is designed
to collect information only from state health departments. A cover
letter explained the purpose of the project and asked for voluntary
contributions of collection records for these two mosquito species.
The link to the online survey was widely disseminated to stake-
holders with the aid of the Entomological Society of America (ESA),
the American Mosquito Control Association (AMCA), the National
Association of Vector-Borne Disease Control Officials (NAVCO),
the Society for Vector Ecology (SOVE), the American Society of
Tropical
Medicine
and
Hygiene
(ASTMH),
the
National
Association of County and City Health Officials (NACCHO), and
the National Pesticide Information Center (NPIC). We also con-
tacted individual mosquito researchers as well as commercial mos-
quito control companies and local mosquito control organizations,
such as the Florida Mosquito Control Association, which publishes
WingBeats,
a
widely
read
periodical
for
mosquito
control
professionals.
The survey tool compiled contact and affiliation information for
the person entering records, as well as county-level records by year
for Ae. aegypti or Ae. albopictus. If no records were reported for
one or both species in the county, respondents had the option to
check a box to indicate the absence of collection records. However,
given the lack of systematic sampling efforts, locations of absence
data are not shown on our maps. The survey opened 8 February
2016 and responses were requested by 1 March 2016, but the survey
tool was available beyond that date. Responses reported here extend
through 16 March 2016.
Management of Collection Record Database
Because our database was compiled from multiple data sources, we
standardized the spatial scale and time period of the collection re-
cords. Kraemer et al. (2015) geocoded each of the collection loca-
tions either with a latitude and longitude or as the centroid of a
larger polygon when finer-scale geo-location was not possible.

 We extracted their records that occurred in the United States be-
tween 1995 and 2014, and then we spatially joined each record to
the county that contained its x, y coordinates. If the record was iden-
tified as either the centroid of a county polygon or coordinates from
an exact collection location in their database, we included it in our
database. For records where the coordinates were obtained through
other matching methods, we reviewed the original citation to verify
that the coordinates were matched to the appropriate county. We
followed a similar methodology for extracting the relevant mosquito
collection locations from the VectorMap database between 1995
and 2016 and linking them to a county. The ArboNET data were
already at the county scale.
We then generated two datasets, one that contained all the Ae.
aegypti collection records and one with all of the Ae. albopictus col-
lection records. These datasets contained the county and year of
mosquito collection. To avoid duplicates, we extracted only one re-
cord for each county in a given year for each mosquito species.
Finally, we calculated the number of years of collection records re-
ported for each county for each species and used the resulting
county-level databases of collection records for Ae. aegypti and Ae.
albopictus to join the county data by FIPS codes in ArcGIS 10.3
(ESRI, Redlands, CA) and map the number of years each species has
been reported by county.
Results
Number of Counties and States With Reported
Occurrence of Aedes aegypti
Between 1 January 1995 and 31 December 1999, occurrence of Ae.
aegypti was reported from 11 counties in Arizona, Texas, and
Florida (Fig. 1a) . By 2004, occurrence of Ae. aegypti was reported
from 80 counties (Fig. 1b) and records were added along the south-
ern tier as well as sporadically along the East coast. Notably, by
2004, records of Ae. aegypti were being reported in the Mid-
Atlantic region focused around Washington, D.C. By 2009, the
number of counties from which the occurrence of Ae. aegypti was
reported had increased to 109 (Fig. 1c), but the reported geographic
distribution of the mosquito had not changed appreciably. Between
1 January 1995 and March 2016, occurrence of Ae. aegypti was re-
ported from 183 counties in 26 states and the District of Columbia
(Fig. 1d). During the same time period, Ae. aegypti was collected in
3 or more years from 94 counties from 14 states and the District of
Columbia (Fig. 1d). Since 1995, Ae. aegypti has been documented
along much of the southern tier of the United States, including
southern California, Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, Louisiana, and
Florida. There also have been sporadic collections of Ae. aegypti
from other parts of the Southeast and the Mid-Atlantic states, as
well as in geographic outliers in Colorado, Kansas, Michigan, and
New Hampshire.
Number of Counties and States With Reported
Occurrence of Aedes albopictus
Between 1 January 1995 and 31 December 1999, occurrence of Ae.
albopictus was reported from 370 counties (Fig. 2a). During this
time period, Ae. albopictus was documented predominately in the
southeastern United States, but with reported records as far west as
Kansas, Oklahoma, and Texas and as far north as New Jersey. By
2004, occurrence of Ae. albopictus was reported from 973 counties
(Fig. 2b). Collection records for Ae. albopictus increased substan-
tially during this time period, expanding the documented distribu-
tion in the Southeast, South Central, and Mid-Atlantic states as well
as southern Illinois, Indiana, and Ohio. By this time, records were
reported as far north as Massachusetts, New York, and New
Hampshire. In addition, Ae. albopictus had been introduced to
southern California several times via cargo shipments from the
South Pacific region by 2004, but in 2001, a shipment from China
of infested “lucky bamboo” resulted in 15 local infestations in six
counties in the region (Zhong et al. 2013). By 2009, the number of
counties in which occurrence of Ae. albopictus was reported had in-
creased to 1,093 (Fig. 2c). Other than documenting the presence of
the Ae. albopictus in Arizona and New Mexico, the reported distri-
bution of the mosquito did not change substantially during this time
period. Additional records were reported along the East Coast,
southern Indiana, and Missouri. Between 1 January 1995 and
March 2016, occurrence of Ae. albopictus was reported from 1,241
counties from 40 states and the District of Columbia (Fig. 2d).
During the same time period, Ae. albopictus was collected during 3
or more years from 514 counties in 34 states and the District of
Columbia (Fig. 2d). Ae. albopictus has been consistently reported
from most of the Southeast, South Central, and Mid-Atlantic states
as well as along the southern Ohio River Valley. Reports for Ae.
albopictus are more sporadic in the western United States than Ae.
aegypti, but there have been consistent reports of the mosquito from
southern California and southwestern Arizona.
Discussion
Collection records of Ae. aegypti from 1 January 1995 to March
2016 are concentrated in Florida, Texas, Arizona, and California,
with more sporadic records in the Southern, Mid-Atlantic, and
Midwestern states. A previous extensive multi-state surveillance ef-
fort conducted in 1964 in preparation of a planned Ae. aegypti erad-
ication program showed that this mosquito was widely distributed
across the southeastern United States at that time (Morlan and
Tinker 1965). The program to eradicate Ae. aegypti from the conti-
nental United States never reached its ultimate goal and was termi-
nated in 1969 due to lack of funds (Slosek 1986). No subsequent
surveillance effort in the United States has come close to rivaling the
intensity of the 1964 survey for Ae. aegypti. Sporadic contemporary
collections of Ae. aegypti along the mid-Atlantic Coast are not sur-
prising, as this mosquito historically caused yellow fever outbreaks
as far north as New York and Boston (Patterson 1992, Reiter 2001).
Perhaps the most concerning development for Ae. aegypti is its es-
tablishment in the Southwest, most recently in California in 2013.
The discovery of established populations of Ae. aegypti in central
and southern California resulted in a substantial, and still ongoing,
public health response that has included enhanced human and mos-
quito surveillance, education, and intensive mosquito control (Porse
et al. 2015).
Records for Ae. albopictus from 1 January 1995 to March 2016
show that this mosquito covers similar areas in the western United
States as Ae. aegypti but has a much wider geographic distribution
in the East, reaching as far north as Illinois, Ohio, and Pennsylvania
and the New England coast. It is not clear whether this recent in-
vader, which was introduced into the United States in 1985 and in
several subsequent introductions (Moore et al. 1988, Moore 1999,
Kuno 2012), has yet to become established across the full geographi-
cal range within which it can persist or if it is still expanding its
range. Although the climate in some newly invaded areas is condu-
cive to reproduction and survival of this mosquito, in other areas,
harsh winters may prevent survival of overwintering eggs into the
spring. In addition, effective and timely vector control may eliminate
highly localized introductions, for example, in tire facilities.

 The county records for Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus presented
here represent our best knowledge of the current distributions of
these mosquitoes, but we caution that, at the national scale, the pre-
sented data should be viewed as compilations of records based on
convenience sampling rather than representing systematic surveys.
Particularly between 1995 and 2004, the substantial increase in the
number of counties reporting these two species is likely due, in large
part, to an increase in surveillance rather than expansion of the geo-
graphic distribution of the mosquitoes. Moreover, these data repre-
sent presence rather than abundance of the mosquitoes, and it
should not be assumed that the climate across counties in which the
mosquitoes are present provides similar potential for population es-
tablishment and expansion. Areas of interest for enhanced Ae.
aegypti surveillance include states in which it is firmly established
(Florida, Texas, Arizona and California) as well as New Mexico, the
other Gulf Coast states, and the Atlantic Coast states where it was
present historically. Areas of interest for enhanced Ae. albopictus
surveillance include the northern range margins across the country
as well as states with less than expected coverage based on records
for surrounding states such as Georgia, Arkansas, and Kentucky.
Ideally, surveillance programs should include the collection of both
vector distribution and vector abundance data, as measured by re-
peated and regular use of standardized collection methods such as
the BG-Sentinel trap (Biogents, Germany) or ovicups (Focks 2003).
Vector abundance data would be essential to evaluate source reduc-
tion and other larval control efforts and to provide thresholds for
adulticide applications. Intensive surveillance in response to a poten-
tial or known introduction of an Ae. (Stegomyia)-vectored virus
such as Zika virus or a dengue virus (e.g., in response to the investi-
gation of a suspect or established locally acquired case or successful
virus introduction) should include virus testing of mosquito pools to
verify local transmission and to determine the infection rate to direct
and evaluate vector control operations (Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention 2016).
Lack of collection records for Ae. aegypti or Ae. albopictus from
a given county should not be interpreted as absence of that mos-
quito, especially if the mosquito has been collected from nearby
areas. Conversely, collection records from a county does not neces-
sarily imply that the mosquito is present throughout that county, es-
pecially for large and climatically diverse counties in the western
United States. Moreover, counties that have 3 or more years of col-
lection records for a given species do not necessarily have established

 populations of that species. For example, extreme outliers to the
north (e.g., Minnesota) or in the central, intermountain west (e.g.,
Colorado) for both species are commonly associated with repeated
introductions to tire facilities (Reiter 1998, Bennett et al. 2005,
Neitzel et al. 2009). Finally, based on differences in the intensity and
spatial coverage of the surveillance effort and the collection methods
used, our maps showing collection records of Ae. aegypti or Ae.
albopictus from 1 January 1995 to March 2016 should not be
viewed as directly comparable with maps that include data from ear-
lier time periods (Morlan and Tinker 1965, Moore 1999, Darsie
and Ward 2005, Eisen and Moore 2013, Kraemer et al. 2015).
Due to their unique biology, the container-inhabiting, day-ac-
tive, and predominantly human-biting Ae. aegypti are only rarely
collected in surveillance efforts that target Culex vectors of West
Nile virus or non-container breeding Aedes mosquitoes. The intensi-
fied surveillance for mosquitoes and mosquito-borne viruses that re-
sulted from the 1999 introduction of West Nile virus to the United
States therefore had very limited potential for generating data for
the occurrence of Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus. Nonetheless, occa-
sional records of Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus were reported to
ArboNET and are reported here. Appropriate surveillance for Ae.
aegypti and Ae. albopictus can include the passive collection of eggs
from ovitraps, active collection of larvae or pupae from artificial
containers and water-holding tree holes or other water-holding
plants, passive collection of adults using Stegomyia-appropriate
traps (e.g., the BG-Sentinel trap for females seeking a bloodmeal
host, or a gravid trap for females seeking an artificial container in
which to lay their eggs), or active collection of adults during the day
using mechanical aspirators (World Health Organization 2009).
Because of their close association with humans, surveillance for Ae.
aegypti should be conducted near human dwellings, for example, by
placing traps just outside homes or schools, by collecting larvae and
pupae from artificial containers near homes or in other key con-
tainer-rich environments (e.g., tire dumps and cemeteries), and by
aspiration of adults near home entry points. Surveillance for Ae.
albopictus needs to be much broader because this species is found
both near and far from human dwellings.
Other considerations for surveillance of Ae. aegypti and Ae.
albopictus include subtle differences in the biology of these mosqui-
toes and between-species competition for container habitats. In set-
tings where the number of containers available for oviposition is
limited, Ae. albopictus immatures can under some circumstances

 outcompete Ae. aegypti (Juliano 2010), potentially leading to local
disappearance of Ae. aegypti. Perhaps more important from a sur-
veillance standpoint, these two mosquitoes tend to segregate in their
habitat choices, with Ae. aegypti being more common in high-den-
sity urban settings and Ae. albopictus predominating in lower-den-
sity urban and semirural settings, although in some areas, these two
species have been found to coexist in urban areas (Leisnham and
Juliano 2009, Reiskind and Lounibos 2013, Leisnham et al. 2014).
This spatial and temporal variability needs to be accounted for if a
surveillance program aims to capture high-quality data for both Ae.
aegypti and Ae. albopictus. And although some artificial breeding
sites such as tires or planters are exploited by some Culex spp. as
well as Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus, it also should be noted that
surveillance for some Culex vectors of West Nile virus, such as
Culex tarsalis Coquillett and Culex nigripalpus (Theobald), often
targets open water larval development sites located in natural habi-
tats not frequented by Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus. When trap
grids are established for surveillance of Culex adults, specific trap lo-
cations are chosen to maximize trap catches based on presence of
Culex larval development sites and perceived dispersal corridors
from those emergence sites, again leading to low potential for collec-
tion of Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus.
Although the presence of Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus sets the
stage for local arbovirus transmission, other factors limit the poten-
tial for transmission of dengue, chikungunya, yellow fever, and Zika
viruses in the United States. Factors that reduce the intensity of trans-
mission of arboviruses by Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus in the conti-
nental United States include 1) less than optimal temperatures during
much of the year restricting the potential for mosquito population
growth compared with settings where they can proliferate year-
round; 2) well-developed sanitation services and reliable access to
piped water reducing accumulation of water-storage containers serv-
ing as larval development sites; 3) high-quality housing, air-condi-
tioning, and use of screens and doors that prevent entry of Ae. aegpyti
and Ae. albopictus females into buildings and thus reduce human-
mosquito contact; 4) capacity for rapid detection of human disease
cases as well as timely mosquito-based virus surveillance to facilitate
early mosquito control response; and 5) availability of financial re-
sources for rapid, intensive response to localized outbreaks (Halstead
2008, Gubler 2011, Eisen et al. 2014, Monaghan et al. 2016).
From a historical perspective, Ae. aegypti most likely was the
primary vector in major epidemics of yellow fever and dengue that
occurred across the eastern United States during the 18th and 19th
centuries. These epidemics ceased in the 20th century, most likely
due to changes to ship design and sailing patterns, urban improve-
ments (particularly to piped water supplies), increasing use of win-
dow screens, and, following the realization in 1900 that a mosquito
transmits the causative agent of yellow fever, mosquito control ef-
forts (Patterson 1992, Reiter 2001, Eisen and Moore 2013).
Following a long period without recognized endemic dengue virus
transmission in the continental United States, small outbreaks of au-
tochthonous dengue occurred in southern Texas in 2004 and 2005
and southern Florida from 2009 to 2011 (Brunkard et al. 2007,
Adalja et al. 2012, Radke et al. 2012). During the chikungunya out-
break in the Western Hemisphere in 2013 and 2014, 11 autochtho-
nous cases of the disease were identified in Florida (Kendrick et al.
2014). Despite these limited examples of local transmission, large
outbreaks of arboviruses transmitted by Ae. aegypti and Ae. albo-
pictus are unlikely to recur in the continental United States unless
socioeconomic conditions deteriorate to mimic those seen in previ-
ous centuries or if other modes of transmission for these viruses be-
came more widespread (Foy et al. 2011, Musso et al. 2015).
