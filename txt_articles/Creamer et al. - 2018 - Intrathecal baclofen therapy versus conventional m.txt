AbsTrACT
background Intrathecal baclofen (ITB) is a treatment 
option for patients with severe poststroke spasticity (pss) 
who have not reached their therapy goal with other 
interventions.
Methods ’spasticity In stroke–Randomised study’ 
(sIsTeRs) was a randomised, controlled, open-label, 
multicentre phase IV study to evaluate the efficacy 
and safety of ITB therapy versus conventional medical 
management (cMM) with oral antispastic medications 
for treatment of pss. patients with chronic stroke with 
spasticity in ≥2 extremities and an ashworth scale (as) 
score ≥3 in at least two affected muscle groups in the 
lower extremities (Le) were randomised (1:1) to ITB 
or cMM. Both treatment arms received physiotherapy 
throughout. The primary outcome was the change in 
the average as score in the Le of the affected body side 
from baseline to month 6. analyses were performed 
for all patients as randomised (primary analysis) and all 
randomised patients as treated (safety analysis).
results Of 60 patients randomised to ITB (n=31) or 
cMM (n=29), 48 patients (24 per arm) completed the 
study. The primary analysis showed a significant effect 
of ITB therapy over cMM (mean as score reduction, 
−0.99 (ITB) vs −0.43 (cMM); hodges-Lehmann estimate, 
−0.667(95.1%cI −1.0000 to −0.1667); p=0.0140). 
More patients reported adverse events while receiving 
ITB (24/25 patients, 96%; 149 events) compared with 
cMM (22/35, 63%; 77 events), although events were 
generally consistent with the known safety profile of ITB 
therapy.
Conclusions These data support the use of ITB therapy 
as an alternative to cMM for treatment of generalised 
pss in adults.

InTroduCTIon
Poststroke spasticity (PSS) is a common cause of 
disability in stroke survivors, reportedly occurring in 
17%–43% of patients during the first year.1 Without 
effective treatment, the excessive muscle tone can 
cause pain and stiffness, deformity and reduced range 
of movement, significantly impairing the patient’s 
quality of life. Management of severe PSS typically 
requires a multifaceted approach involving physical 
therapy and rehabilitation techniques and/or pharma-
cological treatments.2 3 Oral antispastics, particularly 
baclofen, have long been the cornerstone of treat-
ment although they often lead to suboptimal results 
or cause adverse effects at therapeutic doses.4 5 While 
chemodenervation with botulinum neurotoxin type 
A has become the treatment of choice for focal spas-
ticity,6 7 it may be inadequate for controlling symp-
toms over longer periods, particularly in severely 
affected patients with multifocal/segmental disabling 
spasticity.
Intrathecal baclofen (ITB) therapy is indicated for 
use in severe, chronic spasticity of cerebral or spinal 
origin, including generalised spastic hypertonia 
following stroke. Evidence for its effectiveness in 
treatment of spasticity mainly comes from controlled 
studies in cerebral palsy and multiple sclerosis, and no 
randomised trial to date has evaluated ITB therapy for 
PSS. In previous non-randomised studies in patients 
with stroke, ITB therapy was effective in reducing 
spastic tone in the extremities, increasing motor 
strength, reducing pain, improving gait and walking 
speed in ambulatory patients, as well as increasing 
functional independence and improving the patient’s 
quality of life.8–15 Despite this potential therapeutic 
value, <1% of patients with stroke with severe spas-
ticity are currently treated with ITB therapy.1
The ‘Spasticity In Stroke–Randomised Study’ 
(SISTERS) aimed to demonstrate the superior effect 
of ITB therapy over oral medication (conventional 
medical management (CMM)) on severe spasticity 
in patients with stroke after 6-month active treat-
ment and to generate safety data for ITB therapy and 
CMM.
MeThods
study design
SISTERS was a randomised, controlled, open-label, 
two-arm, parallel-group, phase IV study conducted 
in rehabilitation hospitals at 11 European centres 
(Austria, Belgium, Germany, Italy, the Nether-
lands, Spain, UK, Slovenia) and 7 US centres. The 
study is registered at  
ClinicalTrials.

Patients
Potential participants were identified by the study team during 
clinic visits and by searching hospital patient databases. Eligible 
patients were men or women aged 18–75 years with a poststroke 
duration >6 months and generalised spasticity, who had not 
reached their therapy goal with other treatment interventions 
(eg, physiotherapy, botulinum toxin injection and oral medica-
tion). All patients had spasticity in at least two extremities and 
an Ashworth Scale (AS) score ≥3 in a minimum of two muscle 
groups of the lower extremities (LE) on the affected body side. 
Exclusion criteria were: known baclofen sensitivity; uncon-
trolled refractory epilepsy; active systemic infection; presence 
of a cardiac pacemaker, implantable cardioverter defibrillator, 
implantable neurostimulator, or drug delivery device; use of 
oral vitamin K antagonists; use of botulinum toxin within the 
4 months prior to inclusion; and inability/unwillingness of the 
patient/family to participate in long-term ITB therapy manage-
ment. Chemodenervation (including botulinum toxin) and 
surgery affecting limb mobility were prohibited during the 
study. All patients (or legal guardian) provided written informed 
consent before study participation.
randomisation
Using an interactive web-based randomisation system, we 
assigned patients (1:1) to ITB therapy or CMM according to a 
computer-generated sequence prepared by Medtronic. Rando-
misation was stratified by ‘clusters of centres’ via the block 
permutation method employing randomly selected blocks of 
sizes 2 or 4. Clusters were established by grouping centres with 
similar patient type (low-level or high-level functional patients 
(LLP or HLP); see table 1 for definition) and country standards 
of care.
Due to the nature of the treatments, the study was not blinded 
to the investigator or patient. To avoid AS score assessment bias 
and inter-rater variability, all AS scores (except for those during 
the ITB test) were performed by the same blinded assessor.
Procedures
The study comprised a run-in phase (21 days for CMM arm and 
2–25 days for ITB arm) and a 6-month active trial. Both treat-
ment arms received physiotherapy throughout the study per a 
protocol that was predefined by the investigator at each centre 
before study start. Active phase follow-up visits were at week 
6 (ITB arm only) and at months 3 and 6. Unscheduled visits 
could be made in both treatment arms (eg, for titration/refill for 
patients on ITB).
Lioresal Intrathecal (baclofen injection; Novartis (Europe)/
Saol Therapeutics (US)) was used for ITB therapy. ITB arm 
patients underwent an ITB trial between days 1 and 10 
during the run-in phase to evaluate drug response. Patients 
could continue their oral antispastic medications during this 
phase. At the ITB test visit, the AS score was measured prior 
to and at several points during ITB therapy administration. 
Patients fulfilling the test success criterion (1-point drop 
in the AS score in three muscle groups in the affected LE) 
were implanted between days 2 and 25 with the marketed 
SynchroMed II infusion system (Medtronic). After implant, 
patients underwent a 6-week titration period during which the 
ITB dose was increased until the desired clinical effect was 
achieved or reduced for side-effect management; oral antispas-
tics were gradually reduced with complete discontinuation by 
week 6. Patients randomised to ITB who were not implanted 
remained on oral antispastic medications and physiotherapy 
until the study end.
CMM arm patients received a combination of oral antispastic 
medication (at least one of oral baclofen, tizanidine, diazepam 
(or other benzodiazepines), or dantrolene) and physiotherapy 
throughout the study. Oral antispastic medications were 
prescribed by the investigator at randomisation; medications 
(type and dose) were then reassessed at the end of the run-in 
phase at the second assessment visit (day 21±2), and could be 
adjusted as deemed necessary by the investigator at any time 
during the trial, in accordance with usual clinical practice and 
the needs of the individual patient.
The change in spastic hypertonia and muscle tone was 
measured via AS scores for six muscle groups in the LE (hip 
flexors, hip adductors, knee extensors, knee flexors, plantar 
flexors and ankle-dorsal flexors) and five in the upper extremi-
ties (UE: wrist flexors, elbow flexors, elbow extensors, shoulder 
abductors and shoulder adductors). The AS is a 5-point scale 
(1 (normal) to 5 (rigid)) that measures resistance to passive 
movement across a joint.16 Average AS score in the LE (or UE) 
was calculated as the average of AS scores on muscles of the 
LE (or UE) on the affected body side, defined as the side with 
the highest average AS score at baseline. Functional change was 
evaluated using the Functional Independence Measure (FIM)17; 
this assesses 18 items categorised into six domains (self-care, 
sphincter control, transfers, locomotion, communication and 
social cognition) which are grouped into motor and cognitive 
subscales. AS scores were measured at the baseline, second 
assessment (CMM arm), ITB test (ITB arm), week 6 (ITB arm), 
month 3 and month 6 visits. The FIM was performed at baseline, 
month 3 and month 6.

Safety was primarily assessed by recording adverse events 
(AEs) throughout the study. The investigator classified AEs 
according to seriousness, severity and relationship to study 
drug (Lioresal Intrathecal in the ITB arm and oral antispastic 
medication in the CMM arm; adverse drug reactions (ADRs)) 
and/or device (ITB arm only; adverse device effects (ADEs)). 
Procedure-related AEs were those with aetiology of surgery or 
anaesthesia. All ADRs and serious adverse device effects (SADEs) 
were assessed for expectedness versus the product labelling for 
Lioresal Intrathecal and SynchroMed II pump, respectively. Any 
unexpected serious ADR was classified as a suspected unex-
pected serious adverse reaction (SUSAR). All AEs were coded 
using the MedDRA dictionary V
.13.0.
outcomes
The primary outcome was the change in spastic hypertonia and 
muscle tone in the affected lower limb, as measured by the change 
in average AS score in the LE of the affected body side from base-
line to month 6. Key secondary outcomes (see the online supple-
mentary appendix table S1 for full list) included assessment of 
safety (primarily AEs), muscle tone in the UE of the affected side 
and function assessed by the FIM (total score, motor and cogni-
tion sub scores and individual FIM dimensions).
statistics
We calculated that 66 patients (33 per treatment arm) were 
required to test the null hypothesis (no difference in the change 
of the average AS score from baseline to month 6 between ITB 
and CMM) with 90% power. Allowing for 25% dropout in both 
arms, the study initially planned to randomise 88 patients (44 
per arm). Due to patient recruitment difficulties, however, the 
sample size calculation was reassessed during the study. With 
a study power reduction (to 80%) and lower than expected 
observed dropout (20%), we calculated that 60 randomised 
patients (30 per arm) were required.
A blinded interim analysis was performed to validate the 
assumptions regarding the initial sample size assessment and 
to evaluate efficacy and study futility. To preserve the overall 
error risk of α=0.05, an error risk of α1=0.001 was reserved 
for the interim analysis. Following the interim results, which 
demonstrated that there was no need to reassess the sample 
size and that futility could not be claimed, the data safety 
monitoring board recommended that the trial be continued 
without modification.
The intention-to-treat population (ITT; all patients as 
randomised) was the primary analysis set for all planned effi-
cacy analyses, and the per protocol (PP) population (patients 
from the ITT who did not have any major protocol deviations 
and did not exit the study prematurely) was used for sensi-
tivity analyses. A modified-ITT (mITT) population was also 
used for sensitivity analysis of the primary efficacy variable to 
show ‘best-case difference’ between groups; this consisted of 
all randomised patients analysed as treated, that is patients who 
were ITB-implanted (ITB-I group) versus patients treated with 
CMM plus patients randomised to the ITB arm who were not 
implanted (CMM+non 
implanted group). An additional set (ITT 
completers; all patients in the ITT population who completed 
a 6-month follow-up) was used for an ad-hoc sensitivity analysis

of the primary outcome. Safety analyses were performed on 
the mITT for all AEs and study drug-related AEs, or ITT for 
device-related and procedure-related AEs (as non-implanted 
patients in the ITB arm could have experienced these events as a 
result of the ITB test).
The primary efficacy outcome was compared between ITB 
therapy and CMM using the Wilcoxon Rank Sum test and by 
calculating the Hodges-Lehmann estimator, as was the change 
in the average AS score in the UE (secondary outcome). Changes 
in the FIM score, motor and cognition subscores, and six FIM 
domains from baseline to month 6 were compared using the 
Wilcoxon test. Last observation carried forward (LOCF) impu-
tation was used for analysis of primary and secondary variables

both months 3 and 6 were excluded from the analysis. Statis-
tical tests were performed at the two-sided alpha level of 4.9% 
(primary efficacy variable) or 5% (secondary/additional vari-
ables), with no adjustment of type 1 error due to multiplicity. All 
analyses were done using SAS software V
.9.4.
resulTs
Between 16 December 2009 and 31 December 2015, 60 patients 
were enrolled and randomised to receive ITB therapy (31) or 
CMM (29) and comprised the ITT population (figure 1). Thirty 
of 31 patients in the ITB arm attended an ITB test visit (one 
withdrew beforehand), 29 underwent an ITB test and 25 were 
implanted with the device. Of the five patients who attended an 
ITB test visit and were not implanted, two met the test criterion 
but were lost to follow-up, one patient was not tested (the patient 
was deemed unsuitable for surgery and switched to CMM), and 
two patients failed the ITB test and were also switched to CMM. 
All six patients randomised to ITB who were not implanted were 
grouped with patients on CMM (‘CMM+non-implanted group’) 
for analysis in the mITT population, where appropriate. In total, 
48 patients in the ITT population (24 in each arm) completed 
the month 6 visit (ITT completers), including 22 patients with 
ITB-I. T
welve patients prematurely terminated the study (7/31 
(23%) and 5/29 (17%) in the ITB and CMM arms, respectively). 
The PP population comprised 15 patients with ITB-I and 20 
patients on CMM (CMM+non-implanted).

Cerebrovascular disease
Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics were gener-
ally comparable between the two treatment arms (table 1), 
although the ITB arm had a greater proportion of LLP and fewer 
patients with haemorrhagic stroke. In the ITB arm, the mean 
(SD) daily ITB dose (µg) increased from 79.0 (38.1) at implant to 
247.7 (163.1) at week 6 (end of titration); a further increase was 
observed during the follow-up period (279.3 (218.7) at month 3; 
296.6 (246.5) at month 6). In the CMM arm, the most common 
oral antispastic medications taken during the randomised period 
(see the online supplementary appendix 2) were oral baclofen 
(23/29 patients (79%); mean daily dose, 37.2 (26.0) mg) and 
tizanidine (6/29 (21%); 6.3 (3.3) mg).
Both treatment arms were comparable regarding the total 
number of physiotherapy sessions per week (2.6 (1.3) and 2.8 
(1.2) for ITB and CMM arms, respectively) and duration per 
session (56 (16) and 52 (11) mins, respectively). The mean 
number of all study visits (including unscheduled visits) was 14.1 
(8.7) in the ITB arm and 3.8 (1.1) in the CMM arm. 
spastic hypertonia and muscle tone
There was an overall decrease (improvement) in average AS 
score in the LE from baseline to month 6 in both treatment arms 
(figure 2A), with a greater improvement observed in the ITB 
arm (mean change, −0.99 (0.75) for ITB and −0.43 (0.72) for 
CMM). The primary analysis showed a significant effect in favour 
of ITB therapy over CMM in the ITT population (P=0.0140; 
HL estimate of −0.667 (95.1%CI −1.0000 to −0.1667)). The 
robustness of the treatment effect was confirmed with sensitivity 
analyses (table 2), which showed the same effect magnitude. A 
significant effect of ITB therapy over CMM was observed for 
mITT (P=0.0019) and ITT completers (P=0.0240; ad-hoc anal-
ysis) populations, and a trend towards improvement for ITB 
therapy was observed in the PP population (P=0.0592).
For spasticity in the UE of the affected side (table 2 and 
figure 2B), a significant effect of ITB therapy over CMM was 
observed for the change in the average AS score from baseline 
to month 6, both for the ITT (HL estimate −0.600 (95%CI 
−1.0000 to −0.2000); P=0.0042) and PP (−0.600 (95%CI 
−1.0000 to 0.0000); P=0.0494) populations.
Functional independence
An improvement in FIM total score from baseline to month 6 
occurred in the ITB arm (+2.68 (10.31)), while a worsening 
occurred in the CMM arm (−2.58 (11.00)) (table 3 and figure 3); 
the analysis showed a trend towards a treatment effect in favour 
of ITB over CMM (P=0.0540). Trends towards an improve-
ment from baseline were also noted for the motor subscore 
(P=0.0964) and self-care score (P=0.0964) (table 3 and online 
supplementary appendix S3). There were no significant differ-
ences between the two treatments with respect to changes in the 
cognition subscore or for other individual FIM domains.
safety
Treatment-emergent AEs occurred more frequently in the 
ITB-I group (24/25 (96%) patients, 149 events) than in the 
CMM+non 
implanted group (22/35 (63%) patients, 77 events) 
(table 4), although the vast majority in both groups were tran-
sient and mild/moderate in intensity. In the ITB-I group, approxi-
mately half of all events (69 of 149) occurred during the titration 
period.
Fifty-eight treatment-emergent serious adverse events (SAEs) 
occurred: 34 events for 12/25 (48%) patients in the ITB-I 
group and 24 for 10/35 (29%) patients in the CMM+non-im-
planted group. No individual SAE was reported by more than 
two patients in either group (online supplementary appendix 
S4). One patient with ITB-I died after week 6 due to accidental 
alcohol poisoning which was not considered by the investi-
gator to be directly related to the study drug or device. Eight 
events were classified as SADRs (probably/possibly related to 
study drug), including seven events in 6/25 (24%) patients in 
the ITB-I group (two events of urinary retention, and one each

of constipation, faecal impaction, epileptic seizure, peripheral 
oedema and hypotension), and one case of epileptic seizures 
in a patient on CMM. The faecal impaction event was unex-
pected based on the Lioresal Intrathecal product label and there-
fore classified as a SUSAR. Four events in four separate patients 
with ITB-I were classified as SADEs (device dislocation, device 
occlusion, implant site infection and intracranial hypotension), 
of which three led to device revision. One SAE (severe subscap-
ular pain) in a patient with ITB-I was considered related to the 
implant procedure. Apart from the patient who died, no other 
patient discontinued the study due to an AE, and no AEs led to 
discontinuation of ITB therapy after implantation.
The most common ADR in the ITB-I group was muscular 
weakness, reported with a higher frequency than in the 
CMM+non-implanted group (4/25 (16%) vs 1/35 (3%) patients, 
respectively); this was followed by fall, hypotonia and urinary 
retention (each reported for 3/25 (12%) patients in the ITB-I 
group only). Somnolence was the only ADR to be reported for 
more than one patient in the CMM+non-implanted group (3/35 
(9%) patients vs none in the ITB-I group). T
wo events were clas-
sified as unexpected; both ADRs of faecal impaction (including 
one SUSAR) were reported in two patients with ITB-I. The most 
frequently reported ADEs were muscular weakness (three events 
in two patients with ITB-I), fall and hemiparesis (two events each 
in two patients with ITB-I). Six of these seven ADEs were also 
classified as ADRs. Ten procedure-related AEs were reported 
for 7/31 (19%) patients randomised to the ITB arm, of which 
9 occurred in 6 patients with ITB-I, the most common events 
being pain and implant site pain (2 events each in 2 patients). 
In the ITB-I group, almost half of all treatment-related events 
(25/55 (45%)) occurred between implant and week 6 (figure 4).

Cerebrovascular disease
for the average AS score18 (calculated over six muscle groups) was 
achieved in the ITB arm. The robustness of the treatment effect 
was confirmed by sensitivity analyses which all showed the same 
magnitude of effect, although the between-group difference did 
not reach statistical significance in the PP population, likely due to 
the reduced sample size. The observed difference occurred inde-
pendently of any effect of physiotherapy as both treatment arms 
received a similar amount of physiotherapy. Although patients in 
the CMM arm were not managed according to a centralised treat-
ment algorithm, some degree of improvement over baseline was 
observed, indicating active management of these patients during 
the study.
The observed spasticity reduction in the LE with ITB therapy 
confirms data from previous studies showing a reduction of muscle 
tone in the lower limb in ITB-treated patients with stroke.9 10 12 15 
We also observed a significant treatment effect for ITB over CMM 
for spasticity reduction in the upper limb, despite the fact that the 
study was not powered to detect treatment differences in secondary 
outcomes. This result agrees with two previous studies that showed 
a decrease from baseline in muscle tone in the upper limb with ITB 
therapy.9 12
For the FIM total score, a positive trend for improvement with 
ITB therapy versus CMM was observed, despite the relatively 
short follow-up period. A comparable mean increase from baseline 
was reported for patients on ITB in the Ivanhoe et al’ study at 
12 months (+2.86 (SD 10.13)).12 While FIM motor and cogni-
tion subscores in our study tended to improve in the ITB arm and 
worsen in the CMM arm over 6 months, between-group differ-
ences were not statistically significant.
A higher overall rate of AEs occurred in the ITB-I group 
compared with the CMM+non-implanted group, although given 
the nature of the intervention this is not unexpected: patients 
with ITB-I underwent a surgical procedure followed by active titra-
tion of ITB therapy (with optimisation by week 6) with weaning 
of concomitant oral medication. Furthermore, given the higher 
average number of visits per patient in the ITB versus the CMM 
arm (14 and 4, respectively), this finding could be partially related 
to the increased opportunity for AE reporting in patients on ITB. 
Moreover, almost half of all treatment-related AEs for patients 
with implants occurred during the titration period when the ITB 
dose is adjusted to optimise therapy (typically increased until the 
first AE is observed). Observed treatment-related AEs in the ITB 
arm were in line with expected events based on the known safety 
profile of ITB therapy in this patient population, although two 
ADRs of faecal impaction in two separate patients were assessed as 
unexpected (one was a SUSAR). The four SADEs were all consid-
ered expected according to the device label.
The strengths of this study include its randomised, controlled 
design and that this is, to our knowledge, the first study to eval-
uate the efficacy of ITB therapy versus CMM for PSS manage-
ment. Limitations include a lower than anticipated sample size 
owing to recruitment difficulties and that the study was not 
powered to detect treatment differences for secondary outcomes. 
In addition, the 6-month follow-up period was relatively short, 
particularly for evaluation of functional changes. Future studies 
with larger sample sizes and longer follow-up could allow iden-
tification of patient subgroups that will benefit most from ITB 
therapy.
In conclusion, our results suggest that intrathecal delivery of 
baclofen provides an improved therapeutic effect versus conven-
tional oral medications, with a reduction of the AS score in both 
upper and lower limbs when used in conjunction with physio-
therapy. The continuous infusion also confers prolonged and stable 
tone control. Overall, these data confirm and expand on existing 
literature and support the use of ITB therapy for treatment of 
generalised spasticity in adults with PSS.
