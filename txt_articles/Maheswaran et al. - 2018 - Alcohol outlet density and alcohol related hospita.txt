ABSTRACT
Background and aims
Excessive alcohol consumption has a substantial impact on public health services. A keyelement
determining alcohol availability is alcohol outlet density. This study investigated the relationship between on-trade and off-
trade outlets and hospital admission rates in local neighbourhoods. Design
National small-area level ecological study.
Setting and participants
All 32482 lower layer super output census areas (LSOAs) in England (42227 108 million
people aged 15+ years). Densities for six outlet categories (outlets within a 1-km radius of residential postcode centroids,
averaged for all postcodes within each LSOA) were calculated. Measurements
Main outcome measures were admissions
due to acute or chronic conditions wholly or partially attributable to alcohol consumption from 2002/03 to 2013/14.
Findings
There were 1 007 137 admissions wholly, and 2 153 874 admissions partially, attributable to alcohol over
12 years. After adjustment for confounding, higher densities of on-trade outlets (pubs, bars and nightclubs; restaurants
licensed to sell alcohol; other on-trade outlets) and convenience stores were associated with higher admission rate ratios
for acute and chronic wholly attributable conditions. For acute wholly attributable conditions, admission rate ratios were
13% (95% confidence interval = 11–15%), 9% (7–10%), 12% (10–14%) and 10% (9–12%) higher, respectively, in the
highest relative to the lowest density categories by quartile. For chronic wholly attributable conditions, rate ratios were
22% (21–24%), 9% (7–11%), 19% (17–21%) and 7% (6–9%) higher, respectively. Supermarket density was associated
with modestly higher acute and chronic admissions but other off-trade outlet density was associated only with higher ad-
missions for chronic wholly attributable conditions. For partially attributable conditions, there were no strong patterns of
association with outlet densities. Conclusions
In England, higher densities of several categories of alcohol outlets appear
to be associated with higher hospital admission rates for conditions wholly attributable to alcohol consumption.

INTRODUCTION
Excessive alcohol consumption is a major public health is-
sue, and is the cause of a wide range of diseases wholly or
partially attributable to alcohol consumption. The adverse
impacts on health services are substantial; for example,
costing the National Health Service (NHS) in England ap-
proximately £3.5 billion a year [1]. There is a range of pol-
icy options potentially available to policymakers to reduce
alcohol consumption, including restricting the availability
of alcohol. Availability is potentially amenable to control
by local licensing boards and enforcement agencies which
can target both specific areas and specific outlet types for
more intensive regulatory scrutiny. A key element of avail-
ability is the density of outlets selling alcohol in local
neighbourhoods. Previous studies of alcohol availability
have focused particularlyon the densityof outlets selling al-
cohol in local neighbourhoods, as it links to several poten-
tial mechanisms by which availability may drive rates of
alcohol-related harm [2]. These include reducing the real

 cost, including travel time, of purchasing alcohol, increas-
ing competition between alcohol outlets so as to drive
down prices and producing a more diverse market which
matches supply to demand more effectively [3,4].
However, despite the substantial costs of alcohol-related
hospital admissions and the striking increase in such ad-
missions during the last two decades [5], few studies have
examined the association between alcohol outlet density
and hospital admissions [6–10]. These relatively small-
scale studies all found some evidence of association be-
tween alcohol outlet density and hospital admissions. In
contrast, several studies have examined the associations
between alcohol outlet density, alcohol consumption and
other alcohol-related harms, with studies generally finding
positive associations [2,11–13].
There are two main categories of alcohol outlets: on-
trade (on premise) outlets, where alcohol may be pur-
chased and consumed on the premises, e.g. pubs and bars
and off-trade (off premise) outlets where alcohol may be
purchased but not consumed on the premises, e.g. super-
markets and convenience stores. Few studies, however,
have distinguished between on-trade and off-trade outlets,
and none have examined subcategories of on- and off-trade
outlets [7–9]. Recent trends in outlet types in England in-
clude an increase in the number of restaurants licensed
to sell alcohol and especially the marked increase in conve-
nience stores selling alcohol, accompanied by a decrease in
the number of pubs and bars [14]. In addition, alcohol con-
sumption has both acute and chronic adverse effects on
health and examination of hospital admissions offers the
opportunity to examine such effects. However, few previ-
ous studies distinguished between admissions for acute
and chronic alcohol-related conditions [7–9].
We carried out a national study to investigate associa-
tions between the densities of several subcategories of alco-
hol outlets and hospital admissions due to acute and
chronic conditions wholly or partially attributable to alco-
hol. Our a-priori hypotheses included examining if there
was any evidence of lagged effects [15].
METHODS
Study design, area and population
We employed a small area-level ecological study design,
using all 32482 lower layer super output areas (LSOAs)
in England as the geographical units of analysis. LSOAs
are census areas created in the 2001 national census, with
approximately 1500 people per LSOA, and are the smallest
spatial units at which anonymized hospital admissions
data were available. Population data (mid-year estimates
by LSOA, 5-year age band and sex for a 12-year study
time-span) were obtained from the Office for National
Statistics (ONS, London, UK). The analysis was based on
people aged 15 years or more.
Data on alcohol outlets
Data on on-trade and off-trade alcohol outlets were ob-
tained from CGA Strategy (Stockport, UK), a market re-
search company, for the years 2003, 2007, 2010 and
2013. Details have been provided previously [14]. The
company estimated that the databases included approxi-
mately 98% of all outlets in England. Each year approxi-
mately 85% of all outlets, including 95% of pubs, were
actively confirmed to be trading. Data from this company
have been used by Public Health England (London, UK)
[16].
Outlet types were available in a 69-category classifica-
tion for on-trade and an eight-category classification for
off-trade outlets. We grouped on-trade outlets into: (i) pubs,
bars and nightclubs; (ii) restaurants with a licence to sell
alcohol; and (iii) all other on-trade outlets and off-trade
outlets into: (i) supermarkets; (ii) convenience stores; and
(iii) all other off-trade outlets, as described previously
[14]. Pubs, bars and nightclubs decreased from 55105 in
2003 to 49940 in 2013 and other on-trade outlets de-
creased from 48727 to 36191, but licensed restaurants
increased from 18410 to 21433 [14]. Off-trade outlets in-
creased in all three categories (convenience stores from
8083 to 16467; supermarkets from 4417 to 5859; and
other off-trade outlets from 20892 to 23134) [14].
We defined outlet density as the number of outlets
within a 1-km radius of a residential postcode centroid, av-
eraged (postcode population weighted) for all postcodes
within an LSOA (1.2 million residential postcodes; approx-
imately 35 postcodes per LSOA). This approach did not
constrain the density count to areas within an LSOA
boundary, an approach we have used previously [17,18].
The National Travel Survey indicated that 1 km is the av-
erage walking journey length [19]. In a subset of the data,
we also examined the effects of using other radii (250 m,
3 km and 5 km). A Competition Commission (London,
UK) report indicated that 80–90% of consumers lived
within 5 km of convenience stores [20]. We used linear in-
terpolation to derive values between years with extrapola-
tion to 2002.
Hospital admissions data
We used Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) data on admis-
sions to NHS hospitals in England from 2002/03 to
2013/14 (financial years run from 1 April to 31 March
the following year). We have described the extraction pro-
cess for alcohol-related admissions in detail previously, in-
cluding the list of the International Classification of
Diseases, 10th revision (ICD-10) codes [5]. We were guided
by the approach used by Public Heath England in their
‘narrow’ measure to identify admissions attributable
wholly or partially to alcohol [21]. This measure used only

 the primary diagnosis of an admission, except for ‘external’
conditions from secondary diagnosis fields. Admissions
were weighted by age- and sex-specific alcohol-attributable
fractions (AAF) used by Public Health England [21,22].
We examined four main outcome categories. These
were acute or chronic conditions attributable wholly
(AAF = 1) or partially (AAF < 1) to alcohol. In addition,
we examined two specific acute conditions wholly attribut-
able to alcohol: (i) Acute Intoxication subcategory of Men-
tal and Behavioural Disorders due to use of Alcohol
(F10.0); and (ii) Intentional self-poisoning due to alcohol
(X65); and two chronic conditions wholly attributable to
alcohol, (i) All other Mental and Behavioural Disorders
due to use of Alcohol (F10.1–F10.9); and (ii) Alcoholic
Liver Disease (K70). For acute conditions, we considered
only emergency admissions. For chronic conditions, we
used data on emergency and non-emergency admissions.
Admissions in HES comprise ‘episodes’ of care. We used in-
formation from the first episode in each admission [23,24].
Other variables
We used the Income Domain from the English Index of
Multiple Deprivation (IMD) 2007 to adjust for socio-
economic deprivation at the LSOA level [25], the ONS
Rural Urban Classification to classify LSOAs as either (i) ur-
ban; (ii) rural (town and fringe); or (iii) rural (village; ham-
lets and isolated dwellings) [26], and included the nine
English Regions to account for regional variation in admis-
sions [27].
Admission to hospital may be influenced by a wide va-
riety of service-level and local factors, including a hospital’s
admission policies, availability of hospital beds, the level
and quality of primary and community care in a local area,
geographical access to health facilities and local variation
in cultural and social norms influencing illness behaviour.
We used admissions for non-alcohol-related conditions as
a proxy for these other factors.
In addition, a hypothesis that might potentially explain
any association between outlet density and health out-
comes is that outlets cluster in ‘unhealthy’ areas where ill-
ness levels are high and harmful health behaviours such as
smoking are prevalent [15]. We used lung cancer admis-
sions as a proxy for such areas. As annual LSOA counts
of lung cancer admissions were very sparse, we summed
admissions for all 12 years.
Statistical analysis
We used Poisson regression to examine associations be-
tween outlet densities on admissions, using the log of age
and sex standardized expected counts as the offset. As the
associations
were
non-linear,
we
categorized
outlet
densities by quartiles using distributions for the 12-year pe-
riod combined.
Year, rural–urban classification, region and deprivation
(categorized by quintile) were entered as categorical vari-
ables. The logs of the ratio of observed-to-expected counts
for non-alcohol-related admissions and lung cancer admis-
sions were entered as continuous variables.
We carried out subsidiary analyses based on a priori
hypotheses [15]. We examined lagged effects, examined as-
sociations between changes in outlet density and changes
in hospital admissions, examined the effects of changing
the distance radius used for calculating outlet density and
used Bayesian hierarchical modelling incorporating un-
structured and spatially structured random effects to ex-
amine residual spatial autocorrelation [28]. Results are
presented as rate ratios with 95% confidence intervals
(95% CI). We inflated CIs to take account of any
overdispersion.
Ethical approval
The study was approved by the University of Sheffield
(School of Health and Related Research) Research Ethics
Committee.
Data sharing
The data on alcohol outlets may be obtained from CGA
Strategy (http://www.cgastrategy.co.uk/). Data on hospital
admissions in England may be obtained from NHS Digital
(https://digital.nhs.uk/).
RESULTS
Admission counts and outlet densities
There were 1 007 137 admissions wholly, and 2 153 874
admissions partially, attributable to alcohol over 12 years
among a population of 42227 108 (mid-2007) aged 15+
years (the partially attributable count is the sum of the frac-
tion of each admission attributable to alcohol). Increases in
admission counts by outcome category ranged from 37 to
189% during the study period (Table 1). This needs to be
seen in the context of an increase of 37% in non-alcohol re-
lated admissions and 10% in the population aged 15+
years during the same period. Admissions for intentional
self-poisoning using alcohol and acute alcohol intoxication
accounted for 60 and 29%, respectively, of all acute wholly
attributable conditions in 2013/14. Admissions for mental
and behavioural disorders due to alcohol and alcoholic
liver disease accounted for 54 and 32%, respectively, of all
chronic wholly attributable conditions in 2013/14.

 (interquartile range) of 4.79 (2.39–10.47) for pubs, bars
and nightclubs to 0.74 (0.00–1.70) for supermarkets
(Table 2).
Main associations between outlet densities and admissions
(Table 3)
For acute wholly attributable conditions, admission rate ra-
tios (95% CI) were clearly highest in the highest, relative to
the lowest, outlet density categories for all three on-trade
outlet categories: 13% (11–15%) higher for pubs, bars
and nightclubs; 12% (10–14%) for other on-trade outlets;
and 9% (7–10%) for restaurants. For off-trade outlets, a
clear association was seen for convenience stores (10%
(9–12% higher)). For supermarkets, however, the rate ratio
was only 3% (2–4%) higher, while for other off-trade out-
lets, it appeared to be lower at �12% (�13 to �11%).
For chronic wholly attributable conditions, associations
with pubs, bars and nightclubs and other on-trade outlets
were even stronger than those seen with acute wholly at-
tributable
conditions.
The
rate
ratios
were
22%
(21–24%) higher for pubs, bars and nightclubs and 19%
(17–21%) for other on-trade outlets. The 9% (7–11%)
higher rate ratio for restaurants was similar to that for
acute wholly attributable conditions. For off-trade outlets,
the 7% (6–9%) higher rate ratio for convenience stores
was marginally less than the equivalent for acute wholly
attributable conditions but for supermarkets, the 4% (3–
5%) higher rate ratio was similar. A positive association
was seen for other off-trade outlets, with an 11% (9–
12%) higher rate ratio in the highest density category, un-
like the negative association for acute wholly attributable
conditions.
For acute and chronic conditions partially attributable
to alcohol, there was generally no strong evidence of asso-
ciation with any of the alcohol outlet categories. The only
exception was for pubs, bars and nightclubs, where the ad-
mission rate ratio for chronic partially attributable condi-
tions in the highest density category was 6% (6–7%)
higher relative to the lowest density category.
For the two specific acute wholly attributable condi-
tions, the pattern of associations with the on-trade catego-
ries was broadly in keeping with that for acute wholly
attributable conditions as a whole, except for restaurants

 (stronger association with acute alcohol intoxication and
weaker association with intentional self-poisoning using al-
cohol). The patterns for off-trade outlets for the two specific
acute wholly attributable conditions were broadly similar
to those for acute wholly attributable conditions as a
whole.
For the two specific chronic wholly attributable condi-
tions, overall patterns of association were similar to those
for chronic wholly attributable conditions as a whole for
on-trade and off-trade outlet categories. However, there
were some differences in the magnitude of associations ob-
served (30% (27–33%) higher admission rate ratio for
pubs, bars and nightclubs in relation to alcoholic liver dis-
ease; 25% (22–27%) higher admission rate ratio for other
on-trade outlets in relation to mental and behavioural dis-
orders due to alcohol).
Lagged effects, changes in densityand admissions, distance
radii and spatial random effects
Effect sizes were very similar for concurrent and previous
(lagged) exposure measures (Supporting information,
Table S1). In particular, there was no evidence to suggest
that concurrent outlet density was associated more
strongly with acute conditions, and outlet density in previ-
ous years was associated more strongly with chronic con-
ditions. Most admissions were in LSOAs that remained
unchanged in terms of outlet density category, and there
were no consistent patterns overall in associations between
changes in outlet density and changes in hospital admis-
sions (Supporting information, Table S2). The use of radii
greater than 1-km diminished effect sizes (Supporting
information, Table S3). Results obtained from Bayesian
spatial models were generally consistent with results from
non-spatial models (Supporting information, Table S4).
DISCUSSION
Summary of results
Higher densities of all three subcategories of on-trade out-
lets (pubs, bars and nightclubs; licensed restaurants; other
on-trade outlets) were associated with higher admission
rate ratios for acute and chronic wholly attributable condi-
tions. With regard to off-trade outlets, convenience store
density was associated with higher admissions of acute
and chronic wholly attributable conditions. Supermarket
density was associated only with modestly higher admis-
sions of acute and chronic conditions, while other off-trade
outlets were associated only with higher admissions for
chronic wholly attributable conditions. For conditions par-
tially attributable to alcohol, there were no strong associa-
tions with outlets. There was no evidence of lagged effects
of outlet density on admissions. Examination of associa-
tions between changes in outlet density and changes in ad-
missions was inconclusive.
Interpretation of results
Few studies have examined links between outlet density
and hospital admissions [6–10]. A study in San Diego
County found higher admissions associated with higher
outlet density, but did not differentiate between on and
off-trade outlets or acute and chronic conditions [6]. In
Melbourne, on-trade outlets were found to be associated
with admissions for assault (used as an indicator of acute
effects) and, to a lesser extent, chronic conditions attribut-
able to alcohol while off-trade outlets were linked to both
acute and chronic conditions [7]. In contrast, a study in
British Columbia found no significant links between on-
trade outlets and acute and chronic alcohol-related admis-
sions, but observed associations with off-trade outlets [8].
A four-city study in Scotland, which examined alcoholic
liver disease in addition to all wholly attributable conditions
combined, reported higher admissions in relation to both
on- and off-trade density [9]. An all-Wales study found that
increasing outlet density was linked to higher admissions,
but did not distinguish between the effects of on- and off-
trade outlets [10].
A key novel aspect of our study is that we examined
subcategories of on-trade and off-trade outlets. For on-
trade outlets, we found associations between pubs, bars
and nightclubs and both acute and chronic wholly attrib-
utable conditions, as we had expected [15]. The strongest
link
was
between
pubs,
bars
and
nightclubs

 admissions for alcoholic liver disease. We also observed as-
sociations between restaurants and other on-trade outlets
and acute and chronic wholly attributable conditions,
which we had not expected [15]. The other on-trade out-
lets category is a heterogeneous group of outlets, but res-
taurants are a clearly defined category and merit further
investigation to establish if there is a causal link.
With regard to off-trade outlets, we found that conve-
nience stores were associated with both acute and chronic
wholly attributable conditions, while supermarkets had
only minimal associations with both, broadly in line with
our prior expectations [15]. Although supermarkets are
likely to account for a significant proportion of alcohol
sales, they tend to serve large catchment areas and are un-
likely to exert strong local density effects. Other off-trade
outlets are a heterogeneous group, and while they were as-
sociated positively with chronic wholly attributable condi-
tions there was an apparent negative association with
acute wholly attributable conditions. Possible explanations
for the latter include negative confounding and a chance
finding. In this context, however, it is interesting to note
that a study in Perth, Australia also found unexpectedly
that a higher density of off-trade outlets was associated
with
lower
emergency
department
attendances
for
alcohol-related injuries [29].
While Stockwell et al. observed that alcohol price
changes exerted effects observable at zero lag for acute
alcohol-related conditions but which became apparent
only from a 2-year lag onwards for chronic conditions,
we found no evidence of differential lagged effects for outlet
density [8]. In addition, we found no consistent patterns of
association between changes in outlet density and changes
in hospital admissions. Current and previous outlet densi-
ties were, however, correlated quite highly, which would
have reduced our chances of detecting differential lagged
effects or covariation in outlet density and hospital
admissions.
It has been postulated that increases in availabilityof al-
cohol may have diminishing effects as baseline availability
increases [30]. Overall outlet density is generally relatively
high in England [31]. However, we did not observe any
diminishing effects, and in fact observed that effects were
much more noticeable in the highest density categories.
This raises the possibility that if outlet density and hospital
admissions are causally linked, the mechanisms mediating
the link (e.g. reduction in real cost, diversification of the
market to better match supply to demand) [3,4] only exert
their effects when density is quite high. With regard to the
distance radii used to calculate density of outlets around
postcode centroids, the 1-km radius was sufficient for de-
tecting associations. While more complex measures of den-
sity have been used in other studies, we felt that the
method we used was intuitive and relatively easy to
interpret.
Limitations
Our study has a number of key strengths, including the
novel use of detailed outlet types, the analysis of a substan-
tial volume of hospital admissions data at a fine spatial
scale with a temporal element and examination of acute
and chronic conditions wholly and partially attributable
to alcohol. Nevertheless, there are a number of potential
limitations to be considered.
We used an ecological study design which has recog-
nized limitations, including ecological bias, which describes
the situation where associations observed at the ecological
(area) level are different from those which exist at the indi-
vidual level. However, we used small geographical areas as
the units of analysis and exposures and population charac-
teristics are likely to be more homogeneous in smaller geo-
graphical areas, reducing the risk of ecological bias.
Hospital admissions data have a number of potential
limitations. There are likely to be geographical variations
in admission practices and in other factors influencing ad-
mission. We adjusted for this using several covariates, but
residual confounding cannot be ruled out. Spatial analysis
adjusting for residual spatial autocorrelation on a subset of
the data did not, however, alter patterns of association ob-
served substantially. Inaccuracies in diagnosis and coding
and variation in diagnostic and coding practices over time
and by place are further potential sources of error. Impreci-
sion in attributable fractions could have contributed to the
general lack of association observed in relation to partially
attributable conditions.
There may also have been limitations of the alcohol
outlets data used, including varying levels of completeness
of data capture over time and by place, and misclassifica-
tion of outlet type.
Chance findings remain a possibility although the sub-
stantial volume of data analysed reduces this likelihood. Al-
though our analyses were pre-specified, associations
arising by chance remain a possibility, given the multiple
analyses undertaken. Reverse causality is another possible
explanation, as higher demand for alcohol could have led
to an increase in outlet density. However, while reverse
causality may apply to pubs and bars, it seems unlikely that
local demand for alcohol would be a key driver for opening
more
restaurants
and
convenience
stores
in
the
neighbourhood. Nevertheless, although we have observed
clear associations between alcohol outlet densities and hos-
pital admissions, our study cannot confirm if these associa-
tions are causally linked.
Potential implications
There is emerging evidence suggesting that local authori-
ties more active in implementing licensing policy, including
using cumulative impact zones and increased licensing

 enforcement, may see bigger falls in harm outcomes
[32,33]. The evidence from our national study contributes
to the evidence base informing licensing policy decisions,
including in relation to decisions targeting specific areas
and outlet types for more intensive regulatory scrutiny. Lo-
cal licensing decisions may have an impact on the health of
the local population and the burden on local hospitals.
