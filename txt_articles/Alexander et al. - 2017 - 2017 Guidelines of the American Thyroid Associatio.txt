INTRODUCTION
P
regnancy has a profound impact on the thyroid gland
and thyroid function. The gland increases 10% in size
during pregnancy in iodine-replete countries and by 20%–
40% in areas of iodine deficiency. Production of thyroxine
(T4) and triiodothyronine (T3) increases by 50%, along with a
50% increase in the daily iodine requirement. These physi-
ological changes may result in hypothyroidism in the later
stages of pregnancy in iodine-deficient women who were
euthyroid in the first trimester. The range of thyrotropin
(TSH), under the impact of placental human chorionic go-
nadotropin (hCG), is decreased throughout pregnancy with
the lower normal TSH level in the first trimester being
poorly defined and an upper limit of 2.5 mIU/L. Ten percent
to 20% of all pregnant women in the first trimester of
pregnancy are thyroid peroxidase (TPO) or thyroglobulin
(Tg) antibody positive and euthyroid. Sixteen percent of the
women who are euthyroid and positive for TPO or Tg an-
tibody in the first trimester will develop a TSH that exceeds
4.0 mIU/L by the third trimester, and 33%–50% of women
who are positive for TPO or Tg antibody in the first tri-
mester will develop postpartum thyroiditis. In essence,
pregnancy is a stress test for the thyroid, resulting in hy-
pothyroidism in women with limited thyroidal reserve or
iodine deficiency, and postpartum thyroiditis in women
with underlying Hashimoto’s disease who were euthyroid
prior to conception.
Knowledge regarding the interaction between the thyroid
and pregnancy/the postpartum period is advancing at a
rapid pace. Only recently has a TSH of 2.5 mIU/L been ac-
cepted as the upper limit of normal for TSH in the first tri-
mester. This has important implications in regards to
interpretation of the literature as well as a critical impact for
the clinical diagnosis of hypothyroidism. Although it is well
accepted that overt hypothyroidism and overt hyperthy-
roidism have a deleterious impact on pregnancy, studies are
now focusing on the potential impact of subclinical hypo-
thyroidism and subclinical hyperthyroidism on maternal and
fetal health, the association between miscarriage and preterm
delivery in euthyroid women positive for TPO and/or Tg
antibody, and the prevalence and long-term impact of post-
partum thyroiditis. Recently completed prospective ran-
domized studies have begun to produce critically needed data
on the impact of treating thyroid disease on the mother, fetus,
and the future intellect of the unborn child.
It is in this context that the American Thyroid Association
(ATA) charged a task force with developing clinical guide-
lines on the diagnosis and treatment of thyroid disease during
pregnancy and the postpartum. The task force consisted of
international experts in the field of thyroid disease and
pregnancy, and included representatives from the ATA, Asia
and Oceania Thyroid Association, Latin American Thyroid
Society, American College of Obstetricians and Gynecolo-
gists, and the Midwives Alliance of North America. Inclusion
of thyroidologists, obstetricians, and midwives on the task

 force was essential to ensuring widespread acceptance and
adoption of the developed guidelines.
The clinical guidelines task force commenced its activities
in late 2009. The guidelines are divided into the following
nine areas: 1) thyroid function tests, 2) hypothyroidism, 3) thy-
rotoxicosis, 4) iodine, 5) thyroid antibodies and miscarriage/
preterm delivery, 6) thyroid nodules and cancer, 7) postpartum
thyroiditis, 8) recommendations on screening for thyroid dis-
ease during pregnancy, and 9) areas for future research. Each
section consists of a series of questions germane to the clinician,
followed by a discussion of the questions and concluding with
recommendations.
Literature review for each section included an analysis of
all primary papers in the area published since 1990 and selective
review of the primary literature published prior to 1990 that was
seminal in the field. In the past 15 years there have been a
number of recommendations and guideline statements relating
to aspects of thyroid and pregnancy (1,2). In deriving the pres-
ent guidelines the task force conducted a new and compre-
hensive analysis of the primary literature as the basis for all of
the recommendations. The strength of each recommendation
was graded according to the United States Preventive Services
Task Force (USPSTF) Guidelines outlined below (3).
Level A. The USPSTF strongly recommends that clinicians
provide (the service) to eligible patients. The USPSTF found
good evidence that (the service) improves important health outcomes
and concludes that benefits substantially outweigh harms.
Level B. The USPSTF recommends that clinicians provide
(this service) to eligible patients. The USPSTF found at least fair
evidence that (the service) improves important health outcomes and
concludes that benefits outweigh harms.
Level C. The USPSTF makes no recommendation for or
against routine provision of (the service). The USPSTF found at
least fair evidence that (the service) can improve health outcomes but
concludes that the balance of benefits and harms is too close to justify
a general recommendation.
Level D. The USPSTF recommends against routinely pro-
viding (the service) to asymptomatic patients. The USPSTF
found at least fair evidence that (the service) is ineffective or that
harms outweigh benefits.
Level I. The USPSTF concludes that evidence is insufficient
to recommend for or against routinely providing (the ser-
vice). Evidence that (the service) is effective is lacking, or poor
quality, or conflicting, and the balance of benefits and harms
cannot be determined.
The organization of these guidelines is presented in Table 1.
A complete list of the Recommendations is included in the
Appendix. It should be noted that although there was una-
nimity in the vast majority of recommendations there
were two recommendations for which one of the committee
members did not agree with the final recommendation. The
two recommendations for which there were dissenting opin-
ions are Recommendations 9 and 76. The alternative view
points are included in the body of the report.
The final document was approved by the ATA Board of
Directors and officially endorsed by the American Association of
Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE), British Thyroid Association
(BTA), Endocrine Society of Australia (ESA), European Asso-
ciation of Nuclear Medicine (EANM), European Thyroid Asso-
ciation (ETA), Italian Association of Clinical Endocrinologists
(AME), Korean Thyroid Association (KTA), and Latin American
Thyroid Society (LATS).
Finally, the committee recognizes that knowledge on
the interplay between the thyroid gland and pregnancy/
postpartum is dynamic, and new data will continue to come
forth at a rapid rate. It is understood that the present guide-
lines are applicable only until future data refine our under-
standing, define new areas of importance, and perhaps even
refute some of our recommendations. In the interim, it is our
hope that the present guidelines provide useful information to
clinicians and help achieve our ultimate goal of the highest
quality clinical care for pregnant women and their unborn
children.

 RESULTS
Thyroid Function Tests in Pregnancy
Question 1: How do thyroid function tests change
during pregnancy?
To meet the challenge of increased metabolic needs during
pregnancy, the thyroid adapts through changes in thyroid
hormone economy and in the regulation of the hypothalamic-
pituitary-thyroid axis (4,5). Consequently, thyroid function
test results of healthy pregnant women differ from those of
healthy nonpregnant women. This calls for pregnancy-
specific and ideally trimester-specific reference intervals for
all thyroid function tests but in particular for the most widely
applied tests, TSH and free T4 (FT4).
Following conception, circulating total T4 (TT4) and T4
binding globulin (TBG) concentrations increase by 6–8 weeks
and remain high until delivery. Thyrotropic activity of hCG
results in a decrease in serum TSH in the first trimester (5,6).
Therefore, during pregnancy, women have lower serum TSH
concentrations than before pregnancy, and frequently TSH is
below the classical lower limit of 0.4 mIU/L (7,8).
Most studies also report a substantial decrease in serum FT4
concentrations with progression of gestation (7,9,10). Serum
FT4 measurements in pregnant women are complicated by
increased TBG and decreased albumin concentrations that can
cause immunoassays to be unreliable (11,12). Therefore the
analytical method used for serum FT4 analysis should be
taken into consideration.
Question 2: What is the normal range for TSH
in each trimester?
There is strong evidence in the literature that the reference
range for TSH is lower throughout pregnancy; i.e., both the
lower normal limit and the upper normal limit of serum TSH
are decreased by about 0.1–0.2 mIU/L and 1.0 mIU/L, re-
spectively, compared with the customary TSH reference in-

 terval of 0.4–4.0 mIU/L of nonpregnant women. The largest
decrease in serum TSH is observed during the first trimester
and is transient, apparently related to hCG levels, which are
highest early in gestation (Table 2). The median TSH values in
the three trimesters in Table 2 are quite consistent, except for
the study by Marwaha et al. (18) which, for unexplained rea-
sons, reports higher TSH values throughout pregnancy.
Serum TSH and its reference range gradually rise in the sec-
ond and third trimesters, but it is noteworthy that the TSH
reference interval remains lower than in nonpregnant women
(13,15). Since hCG concentrations are higher in multiple
pregnancies than in singleton pregnancies, the downward
shift in the TSH reference interval is greater in twin preg-
nancies than in singleton pregnancies (19). In a study of 63
women with hCG concentrations >200,000 IU/L, TSH was
suppressed (�0.2 mIU/L) in 67% of women, and in 100% of
women if hCG concentrations were >400,000 IU/L (20).
In a small percentage of women, TSH can be very suppressed
(<0.01 mIU/L) and yet still represent a normal pregnancy.
There are slight but significant ethnic differences in serum TSH
concentrations. Black and Asian women have TSH values that
are on average 0.4 mIU/L lower than in white women; these
differences persist during pregnancy (21,22). Pregnant women
of Moroccan, Turkish, or Surinamese descent residing in The
Netherlands, have TSH values 0.2–0.3 mIU/L lower than
Dutch women throughout pregnancy (23). TSH ranges vary
slightly depending on differences between methods of analysis
(24). Subclinical hyperthyroidism is not associated with adverse
pregnancy outcomes; therefore, a TSH value that is within
detection is unlikely to be clinically significant (25).
& RECOMMENDATION 1
Trimester-specific reference ranges for TSH, as defined in
populations with optimal iodine intake, should be applied.
Level B-USPSTF
& RECOMMENDATION 2
If trimester-specific reference ranges for TSH are not
available in the laboratory, the following reference ranges
are recommended: first trimester, 0.1–2.5 mIU/L; second
trimester, 0.2–3.0 mIU/L; third trimester, 0.3–3.0 mIU/L.
Level I-USPSTF
Question 3: What is the optimal method to assess FT4
during pregnancy?
The normal ranges for FT4 index are calculated by TT4�T3
uptake or a ratio of TT4 and TBG, but trimester-specific ref-
erence intervals for FT4 index have not been established in a
reference population. Only 0.03% of serum TT4 content is
unbound to serum proteins and is the FT4 available for tissue
uptake. Sera TT4 concentrations are in the nanomolar range,
but FT4 concentrations are in the picomolar range. Measuring
FT4 in the presence of high concentrations of bound T4 has
proved challenging especially in abnormal binding-protein
states such as pregnancy.
Equilibrium dialysis and ultrafiltration are used for phys-
ical separation of serum FT4 from bound T4 prior to analysis of
the dialysate or ultrafiltrate. Assays based on classical equi-
librium
dialysis
or
ultrafiltration
are
laborious,
time-
consuming, expensive, and not widely available.
FT4 immunoassay approaches are liable to error by disrupt-
ing the original equilibrium, which is dependent on dilution,
temperature, buffer composition, affinity, and concentration of
the T4 antibody reagent and T4-binding capacity of the serum
sample (26). High TBG concentrations in serum samples tend to
result in higher FT4 values, whereas low albumin in serum likely
will yield lower FT4 values. In order to decrease nonspecific
binding and neutralize the effect of nonesterified fatty acids on
serum FT4, some assays add albumin; however, albumin binds
T4 and when it is added in sufficient amounts, it may disrupt the
equilibrium. Nevertheless, the currently used FT4 immunoas-
says perform reasonably well under most circumstances, accu-
rately reporting low FT4 levels in thyroid hormone deficiency
and high FT4 levels in thyroid hormone excess (27).
The serum of pregnant women is characterized by higher
concentrations of TBG and nonesterified fatty acids and by lower
concentrations of albumin relative to the serum of nonpregnant
women. Many current FT4 immunoassays fail to account for the
effect of dilution (26,28). Because FT4 reference intervals in
pregnancy varied widely between methods, interpretation of
FT4 values requires method-specific ranges (11,12,29). Moreover,
such ranges are also influenced by the iodine status of the pop-
ulation studied. Whereas it is customary for manufacturers to
suggest that laboratories establish their own reference range for a
test, this is impractical in clinical practice. It is especially difficult
to recruit subjects with specific conditions such as pregnancy in
order to independently establish method- and trimester-specific
ranges. It follows that it is customary for laboratories to adopt the
ranges provided by the manufacturer of the test. Typically, the
characteristics of these reference pregnant cohorts are not dis-
closed and may differ in iodine intake and ethnicity to an extent
that compromises the value of adopting the manufacturer ran-
ges across different populations.
Current uncertainty around FT4 estimates in pregnancy has
led some to question the wisdom of relying on FT4 immuno-
assays during pregnancy (30,31). In contrast to FT4 as measured
by two commercial immunoassays, TT4 and the FT4 index

 showed the expected inverse relationship with TSH (30). The
authors argue that TT4 measurements may be superior to FT4
measurements by immunoassay in sera of pregnant women,
provided the reference values take into account the 50% in-
crease of TBG in pregnancy by calculating the FT4 index with
the help of a serum thyroid hormone uptake test.
The latest development in the field of FT4 analysis is to
measure free thyroid hormones in the dialysate or ultrafiltrate
using online solid phase extraction–liquid chromatography/
tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS). The method is re-
garded as a major advance, with higher specificity in com-
parison to immunoassays and great potential to be applied in
the routine assessment of FT4 and FT3. Using direct equilib-
rium dialysis and LC/MS/MS, the 95% FT4 reference inter-
vals decreased gradually with advancing gestational age:
from 1.08–1.82 ng/dL in week 14 to 0.86–1.53 ng/dL in week
20 (32). Using ultrafiltration followed by isotope dilution LC/
MS/MS, serum FT4 concentrations (given as mean � SE) were
0.93 � 0.25 ng/dL in nonpregnant women, 1.13 � 0.23 ng/dL
in the first trimester, 0.92 � 0.30 ng/dL in the second trimes-
ter, and 0.86 � 0.21 ng/dL in the third trimester (9). Serum FT4
measured by a direct analog immunoassay in the same sam-
ples also demonstrated decreasing values during pregnancy:
1.05 � 0.22 ng/dL, 0.88 � 0.17 ng/dL, and 0.89 � 0.17 ng/dL
in the first, second, and third trimesters, respectively. Serum
FT4 by LC/MS/MS correlated very well with serum FT4
measured by classical equilibrium dialysis, but correlation with
results from the FT4 immunoassay were less satisfactory (9).
Free thyroid hormone concentrations measured by LC/
MS/MS correlate generally to a greater degree with log TSH
values compared with concentrations measured by immu-
noassay (31). In pregnancy, however, there is little relation-
ship between log TSH and FT4 (r ¼ 0.11 for FT4 LC/MS/MS,
and r ¼ �0.06 for FT4 immunoassay) (33), suggesting changes
in the set point of the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis
during pregnancy. Application of LC/MS/MS for measure-
ment of free thyroid hormones is currently in routine clinical
use in a few centers. The method is ideally suited for gener-
ating reliable, reproducible trimester-specific reference ranges
for FT4 (9). A working group of the International Federation of
Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine recommends
the use of isotope dilution-LC/MS/MS for measuring T4 in
the dialysate from equilibrium dialysis of serum in order to
obtain a trueness-based reference measurement procedure
for serum FT4 (34). This assay technology, unfortunately, is
currently not widely available due to high instrument and
operating costs.

The optimal method to assess serum FT4 during pregnancy
is measurement of T4 in the dialysate or ultrafiltrate of
serum
samples
employing
on-line
extraction/liquid

& RECOMMENDATION 4
If FT4 measurement by LC/MS/MS is not available, clini-
cians should use whichever measure or estimate of FT4 is
available in their laboratory, being aware of the limitations
of each method. Serum TSH is a more accurate indication of
thyroid status in pregnancy than any of these alternative
methods. Level A-USPSTF
& RECOMMENDATION 5
In view of the wide variation in the results of FT4 assays,
method-specific and trimester-specific reference ranges of
serum FT4 are required. Level B-USPSTF
Hypothyroidism in Pregnancy
In the absence of rare exceptions (TSH-secreting pituitary
tumor, thyroid hormone resistance, a few cases of central
hypothyroidism with biologically inactive TSH) primary
maternal hypothyroidism is defined as the presence of an el-
evated TSH concentration during gestation. Historically, the
reference range for serum TSH was derived from the serum of
healthy, nonpregnant individuals. Using these data, values
greater than *4.0 mIU/L were considered abnormal. More
recently, normative data from healthy pregnant women
suggest the upper reference range may approximate 2.5–3.0
mIU/L (15,19). When maternal TSH is elevated, measurement
of serum FT4 concentration is necessary to classify the pa-
tient’s status as either subclinical (SCH) or overt hypothy-
roidism (OH). This is dependent upon whether FT4 is within
or below the trimester-specific FT4 reference range. The dis-
tinction of OH from SCH is important because published data
relating to the maternal and fetal effects attributable to OH are
more consistent and easier to translate into clinical recom-
mendations in comparison to those regarding SCH.
Several investigations report that at least 2%–3% of ap-
parently healthy, nonpregnant women of childbearing age
have an elevated serum TSH (35,36). Among these healthy
nonpregnant women of childbearing age it is estimated that
0.3%–0.5% of them would, after having thyroid function tests,
be classified as having OH, while 2%–2.5% of them would be
classified as having SCH. These data derive from a population
in the United States, which is considered a relatively iodine-
sufficient country. It would be anticipated that such percent-
ages would be higher in areas of iodine insufficiency. When
iodine nutrition is adequate, the most frequent cause of hy-
pothyroidism is autoimmune thyroid disease (also called
Hashimoto’s thyroiditis). Thyroid auto-antibodies were de-
tected in *50% of pregnant women with SCH and in more
than 80% with OH (36).
Question 4: What are the definitions of OH
and SCH in pregnancy?
Elevations in serum TSH during pregnancy should be de-
fined using pregnancy-specific reference ranges. OH is de-
fined as an elevated TSH (>2.5 mIU/L) in conjunction with a
decreased FT4 concentration. Women with TSH levels of 10.0
mIU/L or above, irrespective of their FT4 levels, are also
considered to have OH. SCH is defined as a serum TSH be-
tween 2.5 and 10 mIU/L with a normal FT4 concentration.
Question 5: How is isolated hypothyroxinemia defined
in pregnancy?
Isolated hypothyroxinemia is defined as a normal maternal
TSH concentration in conjunction with FT4 concentrations in
the lower 5th or 10th percentile of the reference range.
Question 6: What adverse outcomes are associated
with OH in pregnancy?
OH in pregnancy has consistently been shown to be
associated with an increased risk of adverse pregnancy com-
1088
STAGNARO-GREEN ET AL.
 plications, as well as detrimental effects upon fetal neuro-
cognitive development (37). Specific adverse outcomes asso-
ciated with maternal OH include an increased risk of
premature birth, low birth weight, and miscarriage. Abalo-
vich et al. (38) demonstrated such patients carry an estimated
60% risk of fetal loss when OH was not adequately detected
and treated. Leung et al. (39) demonstrated a 22% risk of
gestational hypertension in pregnant women with OH, higher
in comparison to euthyroid women or those with SCH. Allan
and colleagues (36) also describe an increased risk of fetal
death among pregnant women with OH. In conclusion, a firm
association between OH and adverse risk to the maternal–
fetal unit has been demonstrated.
Question 7: What adverse outcomes are associated
with SCH in pregnancy?
SCH is associated with an increased risk of adverse preg-
nancy complications and possibly with an increased risk of
neurocognitive deficits in the developing fetus. In compari-
son to OH, however, data regarding SCH are variable. In the
best study to date, Negro and colleagues (40) published data
suggesting SCH increases the risk of pregnancy complica-
tions in anti-thyroid peroxidase antibody positive (TPOAbþ)
women. In a prospective, randomized trial of >4000 women,
a group of ‘‘low-risk’’ individuals was universally screened in
early pregnancy for TPOAbþ and TSH elevation >2.5 mIU/
L. When this combination was identified, LT4 treatment was
initiated in order to normalize serum TSH. In a control po-
pulation of equal size serum samples were obtained in early
pregnancy, but measurement of serum TSH and TPO Ab
was delayed until after delivery, and thus no LT4 was pro-
vided to this group. This allowed direct comparison of the
effects of LT4 administration in women who were TPOAbþ
and had TSH values above 2.5 mIU/L with the findings in
untreated controls. The results confirmed a significant re-
duction in a combined endpoint of pregnancy complica-
tions. In a follow-up analysis of the same data, Negro et al.
(41) reported a significantly higher miscarriage rate in
TPOAb� women with TSH levels between 2.5 and 5.0 mIU/
L compared with those with TSH levels below 2.5 mIU/L
(6.1% vs. 3.6% respectively, p ¼ 0.006). The latter trial had no
interventional component. These prospective data are sup-
ported by previous retrospective data published by Casey and
colleagues (35). In that investigation, a two- to threefold in-
creased risk of pregnancy-related complications was demon-
strated in untreated women with SCH. Similarly, Benhadi and
colleagues (42) performed a case–control study investigating
risk of pregnancy loss in 2497 Dutch women. In this cohort of
pregnant women without OH, the risk of child loss increased
with higher levels of maternal TSH.
However, some published data demonstrate contrasting
conclusions. Cleary-Goldman et al. (43) reported no adverse
effect from subclinical maternal hypothyroidism (detected
in the first and second trimester) in a cohort of 10,990
pregnant women. However, the study analysis was per-
formed only utilizing a selected subgroup of the entire study
cohort (29% of the study cohort analyzed) with a mean
gestational age of screening between 10.5 and 14 weeks
gestation. Furthermore, women were only included in the
study if their pregnancy remained viable until a second
trimester serum sample could be obtained. Mannisto and
colleagues
(44,45)
evaluated
the
relationship
between
pregnancy outcome and thyroid function tests obtained at
12 weeks gestation in 5805 women, from an initial cohort of
9247 women, and found no adverse consequence on peri-
natal mortality. However, because only 63% of the full study
cohort was included in this analysis (5805/9247), interpre-
tation of the data is limited.
In the most recently published study on pregnancy loss
Ashoor et al. (46) evaluated TSH and FT4 levels in 202 sin-
gleton pregnancies at 11–13 weeks in pregnancies that
subsequently resulted in miscarriage or fetal death and
compared the thyroid function tests with those of 4318
normal pregnancies. Women who experienced either mis-
carriage or fetal loss had increased TSH levels above the
97.5th percentile (5.9% vs. 2.5%, p < 0.05) and FT4 levels
below the 2.5th percentile (5.0% vs. 2.5%, p < 0.05). At
present, the majority of high-quality evidence suggests that
SCH is associated with increased risk of adverse pregnancy
outcomes.
The detrimental effect of SCH on fetal neurocognitive
development is less clear. Data from a large, case–control
study demonstrated a reduction in intelligence quotient (IQ)
among children born to untreated hypothyroid women
when compared with euthyroid controls. These data by
Haddow et al. (37) describe a 7-point IQ deficit in the off-
spring of untreated hypothyroid women in addition to de-
lays in motor, language, and attention at 7–9 years of age.
Similar retrospective data were previously published by
Man and colleagues (47,48), although it is worth noting that
such older data identified patients based on serum butanol-
extractable iodine as opposed to thyroid function measure-
ment. Preliminary data from the Controlled Antenatal
Thyroid Screening trials, presented at the International
Thyroid Congress in 2010, have questioned these findings.
Primary outcomes of the study were the mean IQ of children
at 3.5 years and the percentage of children with an IQ < 85 at
3.5 years among children whose mothers were treated for
SCH and/or isolated hypothyroxinemia as compared to
children whose mothers were not treated. In the intention to
treat analysis there were no differences in either of these
outcomes. In the secondary endpoint, which consisted of an
analysis based on study completion, there was no difference
in mean IQ. However, the percentage of children with
IQs < 85 was higher in the untreated group vs. the treated
group (15.6% vs. 9.2%, p ¼ 0.009). The data presented at the
International Thyroid Congress did not break down the
findings based on whether the women had SCH or isolated
hypothyroxinemia. In summary, an association between
maternal SCH and adverse fetal neurocognitive devel-
opment is biologically plausible (49), though not clearly
demonstrated.
Question 8: What adverse outcomes are associated
with isolated hypothyroxinemia in pregnancy?
It is debated whether isolated hypothyroxinemia causes
any adverse effects on the developing fetus. Pop and col-
leagues (50) reported a decrease in psychomotor test scores
among offspring born to women with FT4 indices in the
lowest 10th percentile. These mothers often had normal se-
rum TSH values. Li et al. (51) observed a similar reduction in
the IQ of the offspring whose mothers experienced either
PREGNANCY AND POSTPARTUM THYROID MANAGEMENT GUIDELINES
1089
 hypothyroidism or isolated hypothyroxinemia during the
first trimester. These data have been subject to much debate
concerning methodological processes and the plausibility of
their conclusion. However, renewing such debate, Henrichs
and colleagues (52) recently published data from the Generation
R study, conducted in the Netherlands. This prospective,
nonrandomized investigation evaluated communication de-
velopment in children born to women with isolated hy-
pothyroxinemia. A 1.5- to 2-fold increased risk of adverse
findings (at 3 years of age) was associated with maternal FT4
in the lower 5th and 10th percentiles. As noted above, the
subanalysis of the data from the Controlled Antenatal Thyroid
Study on the impact of treating maternal isolated hypothyrox-
inemia on IQ of the child at 3.5 years has not yet been reported.
Question 9: Should OH be treated in pregnancy?
Numerous retrospective and case-controlled studies con-
firm the detrimental effects of OH on pregnancy and fetal
health. Though no prospective, randomized investigation of
LT4 intervention has occurred in OH pregnant women, such
an investigation would be unethical and prohibitive to com-
plete. The available data confirm the benefits of treating OH
during pregnancy.
& RECOMMENDATION 6
OH should be treated in pregnancy. This includes women
with a TSH concentration above the trimester-specific ref-
erence interval with a decreased FT4, and all women with a
TSH concentration above 10.0 mIU/L irrespective of the
level of FT4. Level A-USPSTF
Question 10: Should isolated hypothyroxinemia
be treated in pregnancy?
To date, no randomized, interventional trial of LT4 therapy
has been performed in pregnant women with isolated hy-
pothyroxinemia (this will change with the publication of the
Controlled Antenatal Thyroid Study). Thus, because only
limited data exist suggesting harm from isolated hypothyr-
oxinemia and no interventional data have been published, the
committee does not recommend therapy for such women at
present.
& RECOMMENDATION 7
Isolated hypothyroxinemia should not be treated in preg-
nancy. Level C-USPSTF
Question 11: Should SCH be treated in pregnancy?
A large amount of retrospective data provides circum-
stantial evidence supporting an increased risk of adverse
outcomes from maternal SCH. Clinicians should be aware of
these potential increased risks associated with SCH, and it is
reasonable to consider LT4 treatment under these circum-
stances. There is a single randomized controlled trial that
demonstrated that LT4 intervention at *9 weeks gestation
resulted in a reduction in adverse pregnancy outcomes in
TPOAbþ women with SCH (40). However, the majority of
women with SCH detected in this investigation were
TPOAb�, and no intervention or treatment was provided for
them. This study also used a composite study endpoint in-
cluding hard-to-interpret variables such as cesarean section
rates and postdelivery admission to the neonatal intensive
care unit. Another randomized controlled trial (RCT)
demonstrated a decrease in preterm delivery and miscar-
riage in euthyroid (defined as TSH <4.2 mIU/L) TPOAbþ
women who were treated with LT4 beginning in the first
trimester of pregnancy. It should be noted that some of
the women diagnosed as euthyroid in this study (TSH
<4.2 mIU/L), would now be classified as having SCH (TSH
>2.5 mIU/L).
& RECOMMENDATION 8
SCH has been associated with adverse maternal and fetal
outcomes. However, due to the lack of randomized con-
trolled trials there is insufficient evidence to recommend for
or against universal LT4 treatment in TAb� pregnant wo-
men with SCH. Level I-USPSTF
& RECOMMENDATION 9
Women who are positive for TPOAb and have SCH should
be treated with LT4. Level B-USPSTF
Dissent from one committee member: There is no consistent
prospective evidence demonstrating that women who are
TPOAbþ, but who have SCH only, achieve maternal or perinatal
benefit from LT4 treatment. Correspondingly, there is no indi-
cation to treat women who are TPOAbþ and have SCH with
LT4.
Question 12: When provided, what is the optimal
treatment of OH or SCH?
& RECOMMENDATION 10
The recommended treatment of maternal hypothyroidism
is with administration of oral LT4. It is strongly re-
commended not to use other thyroid preparations such as
T3 or desiccated thyroid. Level A-USPSTF
Question 13: When provided, what is the goal
of OH or SCH treatment?
& RECOMMENDATION 11
The goal of LT4 treatment is to normalize maternal serum
TSH
values
within
the
trimester-specific
pregnancy
reference range (first trimester, 0.1–2.5 mIU/L; second
trimester, 0.2–3.0 mIU/L; third trimester, 0.3–3.0 mIU/L).
Level A-USPSTF
Question 14: If pregnant women with SCH
are not initially treated, how should they be
monitored through gestation?
& RECOMMENDATION 12
Women with SCH in pregnancy who are not initially
treated should be monitored for progression to OH with a
serum TSH and FT4 approximately every 4 weeks until 16–
20 weeks gestation and at least once between 26 and 32
weeks gestation. This approach has not been prospectively
studied. Level I-USPSTF

 Question 15: How do treated hypothyroid women
(receiving LT4) differ from other patients during
pregnancy? What changes can be anticipated
in such patients during gestation?
The physiologic changes of the thyroid system during
pregnancy have been well elucidated. Total body T4 require-
ments are not static throughout gestation. Rather, data
demonstrate that total body T4 concentrations must increase
20%–50% to maintain a euthyroid state (53,54). In a healthy
woman who becomes pregnant, the intact hypothalamic-
pituitary-thyroid axis self-regulates to increase the T4 pool
for the maternal–fetal unit. Additionally, hCG plays a major
role in the stimulus of maternal thyroid hormone, especially
throughout the first trimester of pregnancy. Together, pla-
cental hCG and pituitary TSH stimulate endogenous T4 (and
T3) production when an intact thyroid is present, and main-
tain a euthyroid state during gestation.
In women with known hypothyroidism, however, serum
hCG and TSH cannotstimulate T4 production. If exogenousLT4
is not adjusted, the increased demand of pregnancy will out-
strip supply and maternal hypothyroidism will occur. Clinical
studieshaveconfirmed that theincreased requirementforT4 (or
exogenous LT4) occurs as early as 4–6 weeks of pregnancy (54).
Such requirements gradually increase through 16–20 weeks of
pregnancy, and thereafter plateau until time of delivery. These
data provide the basis for recommending adjustments to thy-
roid hormone in affected women once pregnant and for the
timing of follow-up intervals for TSH in treated patients.
Question 16: What proportion of treated hypothyroid
women (receiving LT4) require changes in their LT4
dose during pregnancy?
Between 50% and 85% (38,53,54) of hypothyroid women
being treated with exogenous LT4 need to increase dosing
during pregnancy. The incremental increase depends, in part,
on the etiology of the hypothyroidism. There is a greater
likelihood that dose increase will be required in those patients
without functional thyroid tissue (e.g., due to radioablation,
surgery) in comparison with patients with Hashimoto’s thy-
roiditis (55,56).
Question 17: In treated hypothyroid women (receiving
LT4) who are planning pregnancy, how should the LT4
dose be adjusted?
The LT4 adjustment, when necessary, should be made as
soon as possible after pregnancy is confirmed to reduce the
probability of hypothyroidism. Normalization of TSH levels
throughout gestation is the goal. A prospective, randomized
study has recently provided evidence in support of one dose
adjustment strategy for women receiving LT4 who are newly
pregnant (57). For women who are euthyroid while receiving
once-daily dosing of LT4 (regardless of amount), a recommen-
dation to increase by two additional tablets weekly (nine tablets
per week instead of seven tablets per week; 29% increase) can
effectively prevent maternal hypothyroidism during the first
trimester and mimic gestational physiology. This augmented
dose should occur immediately after a missed menstrual cycle
or suspected pregnancy occurs. Confirmatory biochemical
testing should also occur simultaneously. A separate option is
to increase the dosage of daily LT4 by approximately 25%–30%.
& RECOMMENDATION 13
Treated hypothyroid patients (receiving LT4) who are
newly pregnant should independently increase their dose
of LT4 by *25%–30% upon a missed menstrual cycle or
positive home pregnancy test and notify their caregiver
promptly. One means of accomplishing this adjustment is
to increase LT4 from once daily dosing to a total of nine
doses per week (29% increase). Level B-USPSTF
Question 18: In treated hypothyroid women (receiving
LT4) who are newly pregnant, what factors influence
thyroid status and LT4 requirements during gestation?
The difficulties inherent in trying to achieve rapid TSH
normalization following conception have focused attention
upon preconception TSH modulation. Some advocate that
TSH levels be lower than 2.5 mIU/L in women planning to
become pregnant (1). Others advocate that preconception
TSH levels be lower than 1.2 mIU/L. In a study favoring the
latter, only 17% of women with TSH values under this cutoff
had to increase LT4 dose later during pregnancy (58). Separate,
however, from preconception TSH values, it is increasingly
apparent that other factors can also influence the rapidity and
extent of LT4 augmentation necessary to maintain a euthyroid
state during pregnancy. For example, variation and changes in
maternal estrogen levels during pregnancy correlate with
variations in the gestational requirements for LT4 (54).
Given the above, it is recommended that all treated hypo-
thyroid women (currently receiving LT4) optimize thyroid
status preconception. Maternal serum TSH concentration of
<2.5 mIU/L is a reasonable goal for all such women. Ideally,
lower TSH values (<1.5 mIU/L) will likely further reduce the
risk of mild hypothyroidism in early pregnancy, though no
difference in pregnancy outcomes has been demonstrated by
this approach.
& RECOMMENDATION 14
There exists great interindividual variability regarding the
increased amount of T4 (or LT4) necessary to maintain a
normal TSH throughout pregnancy, with some women
requiring only 10%–20% increased dosing, while others
may require as much as an 80% increase. The etiology of
maternal hypothyroidism, as well as the preconception
level of TSH, may provide insight into the magnitude of
necessary LT4 increase. Clinicians should seek this infor-
mation upon assessment of the patient after pregnancy is
confirmed. Level A-USPSTF
& RECOMMENDATION 15
Treated hypothyroid patients (receiving LT4) who are
planning pregnancy should have their dose adjusted by their
provider in order to optimize serum TSH values to <2.5
mIU/L preconception. Lower preconception TSH values
(within the nonpregnant reference range) reduce the risk of
TSH elevation during the first trimester. Level B-USPSTF
Question 19: In hypothyroid women (receiving LT4)
who are newly pregnant, how often should maternal
thyroid function be monitored during gestation?
A study by Yassa and colleagues (57) investigated the op-
timal timing of subsequent assessment of thyroid function
following dose modification. Following LT4 adjustment, 92%
PREGNANCY AND POSTPARTUM THYROID MANAGEMENT GUIDELINES
1091
 of abnormal maternal TSH values were detected when blood
testing was performed every 4 weeks through midpregnancy.
In comparison, a strategy assessing thyroid function every 6
weeks detected only 73% of abnormal values.
& RECOMMENDATION 16
In pregnant patients with treated hypothyroidism, mater-
nal serum TSH should be monitored approximately every 4
weeks during the first half of pregnancy because further
LT4 dose adjustments are often required. Level B-USPSTF
& RECOMMENDATION 17
In pregnant patients with treated hypothyroidism, mater-
nal TSH should be checked at least once between 26 and 32
weeks gestation. Level I-USPSTF
Question 20: How should the LT4 dose be adjusted
postpartum?
The necessary LT4 dose adjustments during gestation are a
function of pregnancy itself. Therefore, following delivery,
maternal LT4 dosing should be reduced to prepregnancy
levels, and a serum TSH assessed 6 weeks thereafter. How-
ever, a recent study demonstrated that more than 50% of
women with Hashimoto’s thyroiditis experienced an increase
in the pregestational thyroid dose in the postpartum period,
presumably due an exacerbation of autoimmune thyroid
dysfunction postpartum (59).
& RECOMMENDATION 18
Following delivery, LT4 should be reduced to the patient’s
preconception
dose.
Additional
TSH
testing
should
be performed at approximately 6 weeks postpartum.
Level B-USPSTF
Question 21: What is the outcome and long-term
prognosis when SCH and/or OH are effectively treated
through gestation?
Although many investigations suggest that untreated (or
incompletely treated) hypothyroid women have an increased
chance of pregnancy complications such as pregnancy-
induced hypertension, abruption, low birth weight, and pre-
term deliveries (35,40), there are no data to suggest that
women with adequately treated SCH or OH have an in-
creased risk of any obstetrical complication. Consequently,
there is no indication for any additional testing or surveillance
in pregnancies of women with either SCH or OH who are
being monitored and being treated appropriately.
Question 22: Except for measurement of maternal
thyroid function, should additional maternal or fetal
testing occur in treated, hypothyroid women during
pregnancy?
& RECOMMENDATION 19
In the care of women with adequately treated Hashimoto’s
thyroiditis, no other maternal or fetal thyroid testing is
recommended beyond measurement of maternal thyroid
function (such as serial fetal ultrasounds, antenatal testing,
and/or umbilical blood sampling) unless for other preg-
nancy circumstances. Level A-USPSTF
Question 23: In euthyroid women who are TAb+
prior to conception, what is the risk of hypothyroidism
once they become pregnant?
In 1994, Glinoer et al. (60) performed a prospective study on
87 thyroid autoantibody positive (TAbþ) euthyroid women
evaluated before and during early pregnancy. Twenty percent
of women in the study developed a TSH level of >4 mIU/L
during gestation despite normal TSH and no requirement for
LT4 prenatally. This occurred despite the expected decrease in
TAb titers during pregnancy. Twelve years later, in a pro-
spective and randomized study, Negro et al. demonstrated
similar results (28). The authors found that in TAbþ euthyroid
women, TSH levels increased progressively as gestation
progressed, from a mean of 1.7 mIU/L (12th week ) to 3.5
mIU/L (term), with 19% of women having a supranormal
TSH value at delivery. These findings confirm that an in-
creased requirement for thyroid hormone occurs during ges-
tation. In women who are TAbþ, both OH and SCH may
occur during the stress of pregnancy as the ability of the
thyroid to augment production is compromised and increas-
ing demand outstrips supply. When this happens, an elevated
TSH occurs. In summary, patients who are TAbþ have an
increased propensity for hypothyroidism to occur later in
gestation because some residual thyroid function may still
remain and provide a buffer during the first trimester.
Question 24: How should TAb+ euthyroid women
be monitored and treated during pregnancy?
TSH elevation should be avoided during gestation because
of the theoretical and demonstrated harm both SCH and OH
may cause to the pregnancy and developing fetus. Because
these risks are increased in this population, increased sur-
veillance of euthyroid TAbþ women should occur. Based on
findings extrapolated from investigations of treated hypo-
thyroid women who are newly pregnant (54), it is reasonable
to evaluate euthyroid TAbþ women for TSH elevation ap-
proximately every 4–6 weeks during pregnancy. TSH values
that are elevated beyond trimester-specific reference ranges
should be treated as described above. Serial testing should
occur through midpregnancy because the increased T4 de-
mand continues throughout the first half of gestation.
& RECOMMENDATION 20
Euthyroid women (not receiving LT4) who are TAbþ re-
quire monitoring for hypothyroidism during pregnancy.
Serum TSH should be evaluated every 4 weeks during the
first half of pregnancy and at least once between 26 and 32
weeks gestation. Level B-USPSTF
Question 25: Should TAb+ euthyroid women be
monitored or treated for complications other than the
risk of hypothyroidism during pregnancy?
In addition to the risk of hypothyroidism, it has been de-
scribed that being TAbþ constitutes a risk factor for miscarriage,
premature delivery (28,60), perinatal death (44), postpartum
dysfunction, and low motor and intellectual development (IQ) in
the offspring (51). Some studies have found, in nonpregnant
women, that selenium is capable of diminishing the TPOAb ti-
ters (61–63). Other authors have described conflicting data (64). It
has also been described that the selenium level can be low in full-

 term pregnant women compared with nonpregnant women.
Recently, Negro et al. (65) observed that TPOAbþ euthyroid
pregnant women treated with 200mg/d of selenium not only
had a significant decrease in the frequency of postpartum thy-
roid dysfunction (p< 0.01), but also had lower TPOAb levels
during pregnancy compared with women in the untreated
group. However, patients under treatment with selenium could
be at higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes mellitus (66). At
present, the risk to benefit comparison does not support routine
selenium supplementation during pregnancy.
& RECOMMENDATION 21
A single RCT has demonstrated a reduction in postpartum
thyroiditis from selenium therapy. No subsequent trials
have confirmed or refuted these findings. At present, se-
lenium supplementation is not recommended for TPOAbþ
women during pregnancy. Level C-USPSTF
Thyrotoxicosis in Pregnancy
Question 26: What are the causes of thyrotoxicosis
in pregnancy?
Thyrotoxicosis is defined as ‘‘the clinical syndrome of hy-
permetabolism and hyperactivity that results when the serum
concentrations of free thyroxine hormone (T4) and/or free
triiodothyronine (T3) are high’’ (67). Graves’ disease is the
most common cause of autoimmune hyperthyroidism in
pregnancy, occurring in 0.1%–1% (0.4% clinical and 0.6%
subclinical) of all pregnancies (68,69). It may be diagnosed for
the first time in pregnancy or may present as a recurrent ep-
isode in a woman with a past history of hyperthyroidism. Less
common non-autoimmune causes of thyrotoxicosis include
toxic multinodular goiter, toxic adenoma, and factitious thy-
rotoxicosis. Subacute painful or silent thyroiditis or struma
ovarii are rare causes of thyrotoxicosis in pregnancy. More
frequent than Graves’ disease as the cause of thyrotoxicosis is
the syndrome of gestational hyperthyroidism defined as
‘‘transient hyperthyroidism, limited to the first half of preg-
nancy characterized by elevated FT4 or adjusted TT4 and
suppressed or undetectable serum TSH, in the absence of
serum markers of thyroid autoimmunity’’ (70). It is diagnosed
in about 1%–3% of pregnancies, depending on the geographic
area and is secondary to elevated hCG levels (70,71). It may be
associated with hyperemesis gravidarum, defined as severe
nausea and vomiting in early pregnancy, with more than 5% of
weight loss, dehydration, and ketonuria. Hyperemesis grav-
idarum occurs in 0.5–10 per 1000 pregnancies (72,73). Other
conditions associated with hCG-induced thyrotoxicosis include
multiple gestation, hydatidiform mole or choriocarcinoma
(74,75). Most of the cases present with marked elevations of
serum hCG (20). A TSH receptor mutation leading to functional
hypersensitivity to hCG also has been recognized as a rare
cause of gestational hyperthyroidism (76).
Question 27: What is the appropriate initial evaluation
of a suppressed serum TSH concentration during
the first trimester of pregnancy?
Serum TSH levels fall in the first trimester of normal
pregnancies as a physiological response to the stimulating
effect of hCG on the TSH receptor with a peak hCG level
between 7 and 11 weeks gestation (77). Normal serum TSH
values can be as low as 0.03 mIU/mL (or even undetectable)
with upper limits of 2.5 mIU/mL in the first trimester and 3.0
mIU/mL in the second and third trimesters. Any subnormal
serum TSH value should be evaluated in conjunction with
serum FT4. The diagnosis of clinical hyperthyroidism is con-
firmed in the presence of a suppressed or undetectable serum
TSH and an elevated FT4.
Question 28: How can gestational hyperthyroidism
be differentiated from Graves’ hyperthyroidism
in pregnancy?
In the presence of an undetectable or very low serum TSH
and elevated FT4, the differential diagnosis in the majority of
cases is between Graves’ hyperthyroidism and gestational
hyperthyroidism (70,71). In both situations, common clinical
manifestations include palpitations, anxiety, hand tremor,
and heat intolerance. A careful history and physical exami-
nation are of utmost importance in establishing the etiology.
The findings of no prior history of thyroid disease and no
clinical signs of Graves’ disease (goiter, endocrine ophthalmo-
pathy) favor the diagnosis of gestational hyperthyroidism. In
situations in which the clinical diagnosis is in doubt the de-
termination of TSH receptor antibody (TRAb) is indicated. In
the presence of a nodular goiter, a serum total T3 (TT3) deter-
mination is helpful in assessing the possibility of the ‘‘T3 toxi-
cosis’’ syndrome. Total T3 determination may also be of benefit
in diagnosing T3 thyrotoxicosis caused by Graves’ disease.
& RECOMMENDATION 22
In the presence of a suppressed serum TSH in the first
trimester (TSH <0.1 mIU/L), a history and physical exami-
nation are indicated. FT4 measurements should be obtained
in all patients. Measurement of TT3 and TRAb may be
helpful in establishing a diagnosis of hyperthyroidism.
Level B-USPSTF

There is not enough evidence to recommend for or against
the use of thyroid ultrasound in differentiating the cause of
hyperthyroidism in pregnancy. Level I-USPSTF
& RECOMMENDATION 24
Radioactive iodine (RAI) scanning or radioiodine uptake
determination should not be performed in pregnancy.
Level D-USPSTF
Question 29: What is the appropriate management
of gestational hyperthyroidism?
The management of women with gestational hyperthy-
roidism depends on the severity of symptoms. In women with
hyperemesis gravidarum, control of vomiting and treatment
of dehydration with intravenous fluids compose the cus-
tomary treatment. Women with severe hyperemesis grav-
idarum need frequent medical visits for management of
dehydration and electrolyte abnormalities. In some cases
hospitalization is required. Antithyroid drugs (ATDs) are not
indicated, since the serum T4 returns to normal by 14–18
weeks gestation. The obstetrical outcome was not improved
in isolated cases in which gestational hyperthyroidism was
treated with ATDs (78). There are no studies reported in the
literature comparing ATD therapy vs. supportive therapy. In
PREGNANCY AND POSTPARTUM THYROID MANAGEMENT GUIDELINES
1093
 situations in which it is difficult to arrive at a definite diag-
nosis, a short course of ATDs is reasonable. If the hyperthy-
roidism returns after discontinuation of ATDs, Graves’
hyperthyroidism is the most likely diagnosis and may require
further therapy.
& RECOMMENDATION 25
The appropriate management of women with gestational
hyperthyroidism and hyperemesis gravidarum includes
supportive therapy, management of dehydration, and
hospitalization if needed. Level A-USPSTF
& RECOMMENDATION 26
ATDs are not recommended for the management of ges-
tational hyperthyroidism. Level D-USPSTF
Question 30: How should women with Graves’ disease
be counseled before pregnancy?
The optimal time to conceive is once a euthyroid state is
reached. Prepregnancy counseling for all patients with hy-
perthyroidism or a history of hyperthyroidism is imperative,
and use of contraception until the disease is controlled is
strongly recommended. Prior to conception, a hyperthyroid
patient may be offered ablative therapy (131I or surgery) or
medical therapy.
Ablative therapy.
If the patient opts for ablative therapy,
the following recommendations should be given. First, sur-
gery is a reasonable option in the presence of high TRAb titers
if the mother is planning pregnancy in the following 2 years.
TRAb titers tend to increase following 131I therapy and remain
elevated for many months (79). Second, a pregnancy test
should be performed 48 hours before 131I ablation to avoid
radiation exposure to the fetus. Third, conception should be
delayed for 6 months post-ablation to allow time for the dose
of LT4 to be adjusted to obtain target values for pregnancy
(serum TSH between 0.3 and 2.5 mIU/L).
Antithyroid drugs.
If the patient chooses ATD therapy, the
following recommendations should be given: 1) Risks asso-
ciated with both propylthiouracil (PTU) and methimazole
(MMI) should be discussed; 2) PTU should be used in the first
trimester of pregnancy, because of the risk of MMI embryo-
pathy; and 3) consideration should be given to discontinuing
PTU after the first trimester and switching to MMI in order to
decrease the incidence of liver disease.
& RECOMMENDATION 27
Thyrotoxic women should be rendered euthyroid before
attempting pregnancy. Level A-USPSTF
Question 31: What is the management of patients
with Graves’ hyperthyroidism in pregnancy?
Several studies have shown that obstetrical and medical
complications are directly related to control of hyperthy-
roidism and the duration of the euthyroid state in pregnancy
(80–83). Poor control of thyrotoxicosis is associated with
miscarriages, pregnancy-induced hypertension, prematurity,
low birth weight, intrauterine growth restriction, stillbirth,
thyroid storm, and maternal congestive heart failure (84).
ATDs are the mainstay of treatment for hyperthyroidism
during pregnancy (85,86). They reduce iodine organification
and coupling of monoiodotyrosine and diiodotyrosine, thereby
inhibiting thyroid hormone synthesis. Side effects occur in 3%–
5% of patients taking thioamide drugs, mostly allergic reactions
such as skin rash (85). The greatest concern with the use of
ATDs in pregnancy is related to teratogenic effects. Exposure to
MMI may produce several congenital malformations, mainly
aplasia cutis and the syndrome of ‘‘MMI embryopathy’’ that
includes choanal or esophageal atresia and dysmorphic facies.
Although very rare complications, they have not been reported
with the use of PTU (87–89). Recently, a report from the Ad-
verse Event Reporting System of the U.S. Food and Drug Ad-
ministration (FDA) called attention to the risk of hepatotoxicity
in patients exposed to PTU (90,91); an advisory committee re-
commended limiting the use of PTU to the first trimester of
pregnancy (92). Other exceptions to avoiding PTU are patients
with MMI allergy and in the management of thyroid storm.
Hepatotoxicity may occur at any time during PTU treatment.
Monitoring hepatic enzymes during administration of PTU
should be considered. However, no data exist that have dem-
onstrated that the monitoring of liver enzymes is effective in
preventing fulminant PTU hepatotoxicity.
Equivalent doses of PTU to MMI are 10:1 to 15:1 (100 mg of
PTU ¼ 7.5 to 10 mg of MMI) and those of carbimazole to MMI
are 10:8 (85). The initial dose of ATDs depends on the severity
of the symptoms and the degree of hyperthyroxinemia. In
general, initial doses of ATDs are as follows: MMI, 5–15 mg
daily; carbimazole, 10–15 mg daily; and PTU, 50–300 mg daily
in divided doses.
Beta adrenergic blocking agents, such as propranolol 20–
40 mg every 6–8 hours may be used for controlling hyper-
metabolic symptoms. The dose should be reduced as clinically
indicated. In the vast majority of cases the drug can be dis-
continued in 2–6 weeks. Long-term treatment with beta
blockers has been associated with intrauterine growth re-
striction, fetal bradycardia and neonatal hypoglycemia (93).
One study suggested a higher rate of spontaneous abortion
when both drugs were taken together, as compared with
patients receiving only MMI (94). However, it was not clear
that this difference was due to the medication as opposed to
the underlying condition. Beta blocking drugs may be used as
preparation for thyroidectomy.
& RECOMMENDATION 28
PTU is preferred for the treatment of hyperthyroidism in
the first trimester. Patients on MMI should be switched to
PTU if pregnancy is confirmed in the first trimester. Fol-
lowing the first trimester, consideration should be given to
switching to MMI. Level I-USPSTF
The combination of LT4 and ATDs has not been shown to
decrease the recurrence rate of Graves’ disease postpartum,
results in a larger dose of ATDs in order to maintain the FT4
within the target range, and may lead to fetal hypothyroidism
(95). The only indication for the combination of ATDs and LT4
is in the treatment of fetal hyperthyroidism.
& RECOMMENDATION 29
A combination regimen of LT4 and an ATD should not be
used in pregnancy, except in the rare situation of fetal hy-
perthyroidism. Level D-USPSTF

 Question 32: What tests should be performed
in women treated with ATDs during pregnancy?
What is the target value of FT4?
MMI, PTU, and carbimazole all cross the placenta. There-
fore, in order to avoid a deleterious fetal impact, the aim is to
maintain FT4 values at, or just above the upper limit of nor-
mal, while utilizing the smallest possible dose of ATDs. Free
T4 and TSH should be measured approximately every 2–4
weeks at initiation of therapy and every 4–6 weeks after
achieving the target value (68,96,97). When trimester-specific
FT4 values are not available, the reference ranges for non-
pregnant patients are recommended. Over-treatment should
be avoided because of the possibility of inducing fetal goiter
and or fetal hypothyroidism (98). Serum TSH may remain
undetectable through pregnancy. Serum TT3 determination is
not recommended in the management of Graves’ hyperthy-
roidism because normalization of maternal serum TT3 has
been reported to cause elevated serum TSH in the infants at
birth (99). The exception is the woman with T3 thyrotoxicosis,
such as in the presence of a nodular goiter.
In the first trimester of pregnancy some women with
Graves’ disease will experience an exacerbation of symptoms.
Afterwards, the natural course of Graves’ disease is for a
gradual improvement in the second and third trimesters.
Typically, this will result in a need to decrease the dose of
ATDs. Discontinuation of all ATD therapy is feasible in 20%–
30% of patients in the last trimester of gestation (99). The
exceptions are women with high levels of TRAb values, in
which cases ATD therapy should be continued until delivery.
Aggravation of symptoms often occurs after delivery (100).
& RECOMMENDATION 30
In women being treated with ATDs in pregnancy, FT4 and
TSH should be monitored approximately every 2–6 weeks.
The primary goal is a serum FT4 at or moderately above the
normal reference range. Level B-USPSTF
Question 33: What are the indications and timing
for thyroidectomy in the management of Graves’
disease during pregnancy?
Thyroidectomy should be considered in cases of allergies/
contraindications to both ATDs, in women requiring large
doses of ATDs, and for patients who are not compliant with
drug therapy. If surgery is indicated, second trimester is the
optimal time. A determination of serum TRAb titers is of
value at the time of surgery in order to assess the potential
risk of fetal hyperthyroidism (101). Preparation with beta-
blocking agents and a short course of potassium iodine so-
lution (50–100 mg/d) are recommended (102).
& RECOMMENDATION 31
Thyroidectomy in pregnancy is rarely indicated. If re-
quired, the optimal time for thyroidectomy is in the second
trimester. Level A-USPSTF
Question 34: What is the value of TRAb measurement
in the evaluation of a pregnant woman with Graves’
hyperthyroidism?
Fetal risks for women with active Graves’ hyperthyroidism
and those who received ablation therapy are 1) fetal hyper-
thyroidism, 2) neonatal hyperthyroidism, 3) fetal hypo-
thyroidism, 4) neonatal hypothyroidism, and 5) central
hypothyroidism. The above potential complications depend
on several factors: 1) poor control of hyperthyroidism
throughout pregnancy may induce transient central hypo-
thyroidism (103,104); 2) excessive amounts of ATDs are re-
sponsible for fetal and neonatal hypothyroidism (105), and 3)
high titers of serum TRAb between 22 and 26 weeks gestation
are risk factors for fetal or neonatal hyperthyroidism (106–
109). TRAb are present in over 95% of patients with active
Graves’ hyperthyroidism and high titers may remain still el-
evated following ablation therapy (79). Indications for or-
dering a TRAb test in Graves’ disease include: 1) mother with
active hyperthyroidism, 2) previous history of treatment
with radioiodine, 3) previous history of delivering an infant
with hyperthyroidism, and 4) thyroidectomy for treatment of
hyperthyroidism in pregnancy (101). The titers of antibodies
decrease with the progression of the pregnancy. The pre-
valence of fetal and neonatal hyperthyroidism is between 1%
and 5% of all women with active or past history of Graves’
hyperthyroidism and is associated with increased fetal and
neonatal morbidity and mortality if unrecognized and un-
treated (110).
A determination of serum TRAb by 24–28 weeks gestation
is helpful in detecting pregnancies at risk. A value over three
times the upper limit of normal is an indication for close
follow-up of the fetus, optimally with the collaboration of a
maternal–fetal medicine physician. Some clinicians recom-
mend to perform the test in the first trimester (106) and if
elevated repeat the determination at 22–26 weeks gestation,
while others prefer a single determination at 24–28 weeks
gestation (68) because of the normal decline in antibody con-
centration, which starts at approximately 20 weeks gestation.
& RECOMMENDATION 32
If the patient has a past or present history of Graves’ dis-
ease, a maternal serum determination of TRAb should be
obtained at 20–24 weeks gestation. Level B-USPSTF
Question 35: Under what circumstances should
additional fetal ultrasound monitoring for growth,
heart rate, and goiter be performed in women
with Graves’ hyperthyroidism in pregnancy?
Serial ultrasound examinations may be performed for the
assessment of gestational age, fetal viability, amniotic fluid
volume, fetal anatomy, and detection of malformations. Fetal
well-being may be compromised in the presence of elevated
TRAb, uncontrolled hyperthyroidism, and pre-eclampsia
(80,83,111,112). Signs of potential fetal hyperthyroidism that
may be detected by ultrasonography include fetal tachycardia
(bpm >170, persistent for over 10 minutes), intrauterine
growth restriction, presence of fetal goiter (the earliest sono-
graphic sign of fetal thyroid dysfunction), accelerated bone
maturation, signs of congestive heart failure, and fetal hy-
drops (106,111–114). A team approach to the management of
these patients is required including an experienced obstetri-
cian or maternal–fetal medicine specialist, neonatologist, and
anesthesiologist. In most cases, the diagnosis of fetal hyper-
thyroidism should be made on clinical grounds based on
maternal history, interpretation of serum TRAb levels, and
fetal ultrasonography (68,106,112,113).
PREGNANCY AND POSTPARTUM THYROID MANAGEMENT GUIDELINES
1095
 & RECOMMENDATION 33
Fetal surveillance with serial ultrasounds should be per-
formed in women who have uncontrolled hyperthyroidism
and/or women with high TRAb levels (greater than three
times the upper limit of normal). A consultation with an
experienced obstetrician or maternal–fetal medicine spe-
cialist is optimal. Such monitoring may include ultrasound
for heart rate, growth, amniotic fluid volume, and fetal
goiter. Level I-USPSTF
Question 36: When should umbilical blood sampling
be considered in women with Graves’ disease
in pregnancy?
Umbilical cord blood sampling (cordocentesis) is associ-
ated with both fetal mortality and morbidity (114,115). It has
been utilized when a mother is TRAbþ and treated with
ATDs, a fetal goiter is present, and the thyroid status of the
fetus is unclear (106,116). The presence of TRAb is not an
indication for cordocentesis (117).
& RECOMMENDATION 34
Cordocentesis should be used in extremely rare circum-
stances and performed in an appropriate setting. It may
occasionally be of use when fetal goiter is detected in
women taking ATDs to help determine whether the fetus is
hyperthyroid or hypothyroid. Level I-USPSTF
Question 37: What are the etiologies of thyrotoxicosis
in the postpartum period?
The most common cause of thyrotoxicosis in the postpar-
tum period is postpartum thyroiditis (PPT). Specifically, the
prevalence of PPT thyrotoxicosis is 4.1% vs. 0.2% for thyro-
toxicosis related to Graves’ disease (118). PPT may manifest as
a hyperthyroid phase, occurring within the first 6 months after
delivery, with a spontaneous remission. This is frequently fol-
lowed by a hypothyroid phase before a return to euthyroidism
in the majority of women by 1 year postpartum (118,119). Some
women will present with mild hypermetabolic symptoms and
may need a short course of beta blockers. Women with a past
history of Graves’ disease treated with ATDs or women who
had a thyrotoxic phase in early pregnancy are at increased risk
of developing (Graves’) hyperthyroidism postpartum (120). In
one study the overall relapse rate of Graves disease following a
pregnancy was 84% as compared with a relapse rate of 56% in
women who did not become pregnant (120). It should also be
noted that an increased prevalence of de novo Graves’ disease
has been reported in the postpartum period (121), although this
association has been questioned (122).
Question 38: How should the etiology
of new thyrotoxicosis be determined
in the postpartum period?
The major challenge is to differentiate thyrotoxicosis caused
by PPT from thyrotoxicosis caused by Graves’ disease. This is
an important differentiation as the two disease entities require
different treatments and a have a markedly different clinical
course. TRAb is positive in Graves’ disease in the vast majority
of cases and negative in PPT in the majority of cases (118,119).
An elevated T4:T3 ratio suggests the presence of PPT. Physical
stigmata of Graves’ disease may be diagnostic (goiter with a
bruit, endocrine ophthalmopathy). The radioiodine uptake is
elevated or normal in Graves’ disease and low in PPT. Due to
their shorter half-life 123I or technetium scans are preferred to
131I in women who are breastfeeding. Nursing can resume
several days after a 123I or technetium scan.
Question 39: How should Graves’ hyperthyroidism
be treated in lactating women?
The use of moderate doses of ATDs during breastfeeding
is safe. In one study, breastfed infants of mothers with elevated
TSH levels after administration of high doses of MMI had
normal T4 and TSH levels (123). Furthermore, the physical and
intellectual development of children, aged 48–86 months, re-
mained unchanged in comparison with controls when assessed
by the Wechsler and Goodenough tests (124). The conclusion
drawn from these studies is that breastfeeding is safe in
mothers on ATDs at moderate doses (PTU less than 300 mg/d
or methimazole 20–30 mg/d). It is currently recommended that
breast-feeding infants of mothers taking ATDs be screened
with thyroid function tests and that the mothers take their
ATDs in divided doses immediately following each feeding.
& RECOMMENDATION 35
MMI in doses up to 20–30 mg/d is safe for lactating
mothers and their infants. PTU at doses up to 300 mg/d is a
second-line agent due to concerns about severe hepato-
toxicity. ATDs should be administered following a feeding
and in divided doses. Level A-USPSTF
Clinical Guidelines for Iodine Nutrition
Question 40: Why is increased iodine intake required
in pregnancy and lactation, and how is iodine
intake assessed?
Because of increased thyroid hormone production, in-
creased renal iodine excretion, and fetal iodine requirements,
dietary iodine requirements are higher in pregnancy than they
are for nonpregnant adults (125). Women with adequate io-
dine intake before and during pregnancy have adequate in-
trathyroidal iodine stores and have no difficulty adapting to
the increased demand for thyroid hormone during gestation.
In these women, total body iodine levels remain stable
throughout pregnancy (126). However, in areas of even mild
to moderate iodine deficiency, total body iodine stores, as
reflected by urinary iodine values, decline gradually from the
first to the third trimester of pregnancy (127). Iodine, required
for infant nutrition, is secreted into breast milk. Therefore,
lactating women also have increased dietary iodine require-
ments (128,129).
Spot urinary iodine values are used most frequently for
determination of iodine status in general populations. A
limitation of urinary iodine testing is that identifying partic-
ular individuals at risk for iodine deficiency is problematic
because there is substantial diurnal and day-to-day variation
in urinary iodine excretion (129).
Question 41: What is the impact of severe iodine
deficiency on the mother, fetus, and child?
Maternal dietary iodine deficiency results in impaired
maternal and fetal thyroid hormone synthesis. Low thyroid

 hormone values stimulate increased pituitary TSH produc-
tion, and the increased TSH stimulates thyroid growth, re-
sulting in maternal and fetal goiter (130). Severe iodine
deficiency in pregnant women has been associated with in-
creased rates of miscarriage, stillbirth, and increased perinatal
and infant mortality (131).
Normal levels of thyroid hormone are essential for neu-
ronal migration and myelination of the fetal brain. Thyroid
hormones are needed throughout pregnancy and in partic-
ular between the third and fifth months of intrauterine life.
As iodine deficiency affects both maternal and fetal thyroid,
both sources of thyroid hormone production may be af-
fected. Maternal and fetal iodine deficiency in pregnancy
and neonatal iodine deficiency have adverse effects on the
cognitive function of offspring (132–135). Children whose
mothers were severely iodine deficient during pregnancy
may exhibit cretinism, characterized by profound mental
retardation, deaf-mutism, and motor rigidity. Iodine defi-
ciency is the leading cause of preventable mental retardation
worldwide (136).
Question 42: What is the impact of mild to moderate
iodine deficiency on the mother, fetus, and child?
Groups of pregnant women whose median urinary iodine
concentrations are 50–150 mg/L are defined as mildly to
moderately iodine deficient. Women with mild to moderate
iodine deficiency during pregnancy are at increased risk for
the development of goiter (130). In addition, decreased thy-
roid hormone associated with even mild to moderate iodine
deficiency may have adverse effects on the cognitive function
of the offspring (132–134). Mild to moderate maternal iodine
deficiency has also been associated with attention deficit and
hyperactivity disorders (137).
Question 43: What is the iodine status of pregnant
and breastfeeding women in the United States?
Surveillance of urinary iodine values of the U.S. population
has been carried out at intervals since 1971. Following a pre-
cipitous drop in urinary iodine values between 1971 and 1994,
U.S. dietary iodine intake has stabilized (138–142). The U.S.
population overall remains iodine sufficient. However, U.S.
women of reproductive age are the most likely group to have
low urinary iodine values.
According to the World Health Organization (WHO)
guidelines, median urinary iodine values for pregnant
women between 149 and 249 mg/L are consistent with
optimal iodine intake (132). In the 2001–2006 National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES)
surveys, the median urinary iodine concentration among
326 pregnant women was marginal at 153 mg/L and 17%
of pregnant women had urinary iodine concentrations
<50 mg/L (143). It is not clear whether these women were
truly iodine deficient or whether their low values just re-
presented random fluctuation. Current data regarding io-
dine sufficiency among lactating U.S. women are very
limited. It is possible that a subset of pregnant and lac-
tating U.S. women may have mildly to moderately inad-
equate
dietary
iodine
intake
resulting
in
insufficient
amounts of iodine in the breast milk to meet infants’ di-
etary requirements (144,145).
Question 44: What is the iodine status of pregnant
and breastfeeding women worldwide?
Since 1990, the number of households worldwide using io-
dized salt has risen from less than 20% to more than 70% (146).
Despite these advances, however, iodine deficiency affects over
2.2 billion individuals globally, especially in South Asian, East
Asia Pacific, and East and South African regions, and remains
the leading cause of preventable intellectual deficits (134).
Question 45: Does iodine supplementation
in pregnancy and lactation improve outcomes
in severe iodine deficiency?
In areas of severe iodine deficiency, iodine supplementa-
tion of mothers prior to conception or in early pregnancy re-
sults in children with improved cognitive performance
relative to those given a placebo (147–149). The prevalence of
cretinisim and other severe neurological abnormalities is
significantly reduced (150). Maternal iodine supplementation
in severely iodine-deficient areas also decreases rates of still-
birth and neonatal and infant mortality (151,152).
Question 46: Does iodine supplementation
in pregnancy and lactation improve outcomes
in mildly to moderately iodine-deficient women?
Eight controlled trials of iodine supplementation in mildly to
moderately iodine-deficient pregnant European women have
been published (153–160), although doses and timing of iodine
supplementation varied and only two trials examined effects
on offspring development. Iodine supplementation of moder-
ately deficient pregnant women appears to consistently de-
crease maternal and neonatal thyroid volumes and Tg levels.
Effects on maternal thyroid function have been mixed, with
significant maternal TSH decreases with supplementation de-
scribed in four (149,151,152,154) of the eight published trials,
and increases in maternal T4 or FT4 noted in just two (151,154).
In both studies where assessed, neurodevelopmental out-
comes were improved in children from mildly to moderately
iodine-deficient areas whose mothers received iodine sup-
plementation early in pregnancy (148,154). The timing of
supplementation is likely to be critical because the beneficial
effects of iodine on offspring development appeared to be lost
if supplementation is started after 10–20 weeks gestation.
No trials to date have specifically examined the effects of
iodine supplementation in lactation.
Question 47: What is the recommended daily iodine
intake in women planning pregnancy, women who
are pregnant, and women who are breastfeeding?
Iodine is an essential nutrient required for thyroid hormone
production and is primarily derived from the diet and from
vitamin/mineral preparations. The Institute of Medicine re-
commended dietary allowances to be used as goals for indi-
vidual total daily iodine intake (dietary and supplement) are
150 mg/d for women planning a pregnancy, 220 mg/d for
pregnant women, and 290 mg/d for women who are breast-
feeding (161). WHO recommends 250 mg/d for pregnant
women and for lactating women (130).
Dietary iodine sources vary regionally. Sources of iodine in
the U.S. diet have been difficult to identify, in part because
there are a wide variety of potential sources and food iodine

 content is not listed on packaging. Iodized salt remains the
mainstay of iodine deficiency disorder eradication efforts
worldwide. However, salt iodization has never been man-
dated in the United States and only approximately 70% of salt
sold for household use in the United States is iodized (162). In
the U.S. dairy foods are another important source of dietary
iodine due to the use of iodophor disinfectants by the dairy
industry (163–165). Commercially baked breads have been
another major source of iodine in the United States due to the
use of iodate bread conditioners (165). However, the use of
iodate bread conditioners has decreased over the past several
decades. Other sources of iodine in the U.S. diet are seafood,
eggs, meat, and poultry (166). Foods of marine origin have
higher concentrations of iodine because marine animals con-
centrate iodine from seawater (155–157).
In the United States, the dietary iodine intake of individuals
cannot be reliably ascertained either by patient history or by any
laboratory measure. Due to concerns that a subset of pregnant
U.S. women may be mildly to moderately iodine deficient and
an inability to identify individual women who may be at risk,
the ATA has previously recommended 150 mg daily as iodine
supplementation for all North American women who are
pregnant or breastfeeding (167). The goal is supplementation of,
rather than replacement for, dietary iodine intake.
Recommendations
regarding
iodine
supplementation
in North America have not been widely adopted. In the
NHANES 2001–2006 dataset, only 20% of pregnant women
and 15% of lactating women reported ingesting iodine-
containing supplements (168). Of the 223 types of prenatal
multivitamins available in the United States, only 51% contain
any iodine (169). Iodine in U.S. prenatal multivitamins is
typically derived either from potassium iodide (KI) or from
kelp. The iodine content in prenatal multivitamin brands
containing kelp may be inconsistent due to variability in kelp
iodine content (162).
& RECOMMENDATION 36
All pregnant and lactating women should ingest a mini-
mum of 250 mg iodine daily. Level A-USPSTF
& RECOMMENDATION 37
To achieve a total of 250 mg iodine ingestion daily in North
America all women who are planning to be pregnant or are
pregnant or breastfeeding should supplement their diet
with a daily oral supplement that contains 150 mg of iodine.
This is optimally delivered in the form of potassium iodide
because kelp and other forms of seaweed do not provide a
consistent delivery of daily iodide. Level B-USPSTF
& RECOMMENDATION 38
In areas of the world outside of North America, strategies
for ensuring adequate iodine intake during preconcep-
tion, pregnancy, and lactation should vary according to
regional dietary patterns and availability of iodized salt.
Level A-USPSTF
Question 48: What is the safe upper limit for iodine
consumption in pregnant and breastfeeding women?
Most people are tolerant of chronic excess dietary iodine
intake due to a homeostatic mechanism known as the Wolff–
Chaikoff effect (170,171). In response to a large iodine load,
there is a transient inhibition of thyroid hormone synthesis.
Following several days of continued exposure to high iodine
levels, escape from the acute Wolff–Chaikoff effect is medi-
ated by a decrease in the active transport of iodine into the
thyroid gland, and thyroid hormone production resumes at
normal levels (172).
Some individuals do not appropriately escape from the
acute Wolff–Chaikoff effect, making them susceptible to hy-
pothyroidism in the setting of high iodine intake. The fetus
may be particularly susceptible, since the ability to escape
from the acute Wolff–Chaikoff effect does not fully mature
until about week 36 of gestation (173,174).
Tolerable upper intake levels for iodine have been estab-
lished to determine the highest level of daily nutrient intake
that is likely to be tolerated biologically and to pose no risk of
adverse health effects for almost all individuals in the general
population. The upper intake levels are based on total intake
of a nutrient from food, water, and supplements and apply to
chronic daily use. The U.S. Institute of Medicine has defined
the tolerable upper limit for daily iodine intake as 1100 mg/d
in all adults, including pregnant women (1.1 mg/d) (155) and
WHO has stated that daily iodine intake >500 mg may be
excessive in pregnancy, but these maximal values are based
on limited data.
Medications may be a source of excessive iodine intake for
some individuals. Amiodarone, an antiarrythmic agent (175),
contains 75 mg iodine per 200 mg tablet. Iodinated intrave-
nous radiographic contrast agents contain up to 380 mg of
iodine per milliliter. Some topical antiseptics contain iodine,
although systemic absorption is generally not clinically sig-
nificant in adults except in patients with severe burns
(176). Iodine-containing anti-asthmatic medications and ex-
pectorants are occasionally used. In addition, some dietary
supplements may contain large amounts of iodine.
& RECOMMENDATION 39
Pharmacologic doses of iodine exposure during pregnancy
should be avoided, except in preparation for thyroid sur-
gery for Graves’ disease. Clinicians should carefully weigh
the risks and benefits when ordering medications or diag-
nostic tests that will result in high iodine exposure.
Level C-USPSTF

Sustained iodine intake from diet and dietary supplements

Spontaneous Pregnancy Loss, Preterm Delivery,
and Thyroid Antibodies
Thyroid antibodies and pregnancy loss.
Spontaneous
pregnancy loss, or miscarriage, has been reported to occur in
between 17% and 31% of all gestations (172,177). A sponta-
neous pregnancy loss is defined as one occurring at less than
20 weeks of gestation. The individual risk varies by a number
of clinical factors including maternal age, family history, en-
vironmental exposures, and medical comorbidities (178).
Pregnancy losses are a significant emotional burden to pa-
tients and may also result in bleeding, infections, pain, and
surgical procedures.

 Question 49: Is there an association between thyroid
antibody positivity and sporadic spontaneous abortion
in euthyroid women?
Endocrine disorders have been previously recognized as
risk factors for spontaneous pregnancy loss. Patients with
poorly controlled diabetes mellitus may have up to a 50% risk
of loss (179). Thyroid dysfunction has also been associated with
increased rates of pregnancy loss (25,180). Stagnaro-Green and
colleagues (181) published the first paper that demonstrated an
association between pregnancy loss and thyroid antibodies. In
that prospective observational study, patients who were posi-
tive for thyroid antibodies (TPO and Tg) had a twofold increase
in the risk of a pregnancy loss (17% vs. 8.4%, p ¼ 0.011). Iijima
and colleagues (182) also reported a nearly twofold increase in
spontaneous pregnancy loss in patients who were positive for
anti-microsomal antibodies. Glinoer and colleagues (183) re-
ported a fourfold increase in pregnancy loss (13.3 vs. 3.3 %,
p < .001) with the presence of TPOAb. Other authors have re-
ported similar findings (184,185). Sezer and colleagues (186), in
a small prospective study, reported no increase in pregnancy
loss in women with thyroid auto-antibodies (28.6% vs. 20%,
p ¼ ns). However, they did find a higher titer of anti-Tg anti-
body in pregnancies that ended in abortion compared with
those that went to term.
A meta-analysis of 8 case–control and 10 longitudinal
studies demonstrated a clear association between thyroid
antibodies and spontaneous abortion (OR 2.30, 95% CI 1.80–
2.95) (187). The meta-analysis also reported that TAbþ
women were slightly older (0.7 years) and had a slightly
higher TSH (0.81) than antibody-negative women. A review
of the studies also reveals that there was an unusually low rate
of pregnancy loss in the control groups. Although a clear as-
sociation has been made between thyroid antibodies and
abortion, it does not prove causality. Three research groups
have demonstrated a possible mechanism through increased
fetal resorption in an active immunization murine model with
either Tg or TPO antibodies (188–190).
Question 50: Should women be screened for TPO
antibodies before or during pregnancy with the goal
of treating TPOAb+ euthyroid women with LT4
to decrease the rate of spontaneous miscarriage?
Negro and colleagues (28) reported a prospective, ran-
domized interventional trial of LT4 in euthyroid patients who
were TPOAbþ. They reported a significantly decreased rate of
pregnancy loss in the treated group (3.5% vs. 13.8%, p < .05).
A limitation of the study is that the mean gestational age of
starting LT4 was 10 weeks estimated gestational age, and all
but one of the losses had occurred at less than 11 weeks.
& RECOMMENDATION 41
There is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against
screening all women for thyroid antibodies in the first tri-
mester of pregnancy. Level I-USPSTF
Question 51: Is there an association between thyroid
antibodies and recurrent spontaneous abortion in
euthyroid women?
Recurrent pregnancy loss is defined as either two consecu-
tive losses or three total spontaneous losses and may occur in up
to 1% of all women (191). Several causes have been reported,
including parental chromosomal anomalies, immunologic de-
rangements, uterine pathology, and endocrine dysfunction
(192). In a case–control study, Irivani and colleagues (193) re-
ported that patients with primary recurrent pregnancy losses
(three or more) had a higher prevalence of thyroid antibody
positivity (OR 2.24, 95% CL 1.5–3.3). Kutteh et al. (194) reported
similar findings with an increased rate of thyroid antibody
positivity in 700 women with recurrent abortion as compared
with 200 healthy controls (22.5% vs. 14.5%, p ¼ 0.01). On the
other hand, in a prospective observational study, Esplin and
colleagues (195) demonstrated no difference in thyroid anti-
body positivity between patients with recurrent pregnancy loss
and healthy controls. Pratt and colleagues reported a higher rate
of subsequent pregnancy loss in patients with recurrent losses
and thyroid antibody positivity (196). In a larger trial with a
similar population, Rushworth and colleagues (197) reported
no significant difference in live birth rates between women with
recurrent losses who were positive for thyroid antibodies and
those who were not.
The data for an association between thyroid antibodies and
recurrent pregnancy loss are less robust than for sporadic loss
and somewhat contradictory. This may be because recurrent
pregnancy loss has many potential causes, and endocrine
dysfunction may only account for 15%–20% of all cases (192).
Many of the previously mentioned trials did not control for
other potential causes of recurrent losses. One intriguing
study reported an apparent interaction of anti-phospholipid
antibodies and thyroid antibodies in the risk of recurrent
pregnancy loss (198).
Question 52: Should women with recurrent abortion
be screened for thyroid antibodies before or during
pregnancy with the goal of treating TAb+ euthyroid
women with LT4 or intravenous immunoglobulin
therapy (IVIG) to decrease the rate of recurrent
spontaneous abortion?
Three small nonrandomized case series have been pub-
lished on the use of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG)
therapy for the prevention of recurrent pregnancy loss in
women with thyroid antibodies (199–201). The live birth rates
ranged from 80% to 95%, and the one study with a control
group (consisting of women who refused IVIG therapy) re-
ported a highly significant improvement in live births in the
IVIG-treated cohort (95% vs. 0% p ¼ .001) (200). Comparison
of LT4 intervention with IVIG in one study resulted in a higher
rate of term delivery in the LT4-treated group (201). However,
all three studies had serious design flaws including small
sample size, heterogeneous patient populations, lack of or
limited randomization, and differences when treatment was
initiated. In summary, intervention trials with IVIG or LT4 in
TAbþ women with recurrent abortion have shown a decrease
in the recurrent abortion rate but are limited by methodo-
logical problems.
& RECOMMENDATION 42
There is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against
screening for thyroid antibodies, or treating in the first
trimester of pregnancy with LT4 or IVIG, in euthyroid
women with sporadic or recurrent abortion or in women
undergoing in vitro fertilization (IVF). Level I-USPSTF

Question 54: Is there an association between thyroid
antibody positivity and pregnancy loss in euthyroid
women undergoing IVF?
Several authors have reported an increased risk of preg-
nancy loss after assisted reproductive procedures in women
who are positive for thyroid antibodies (202–204). Other au-
thors have found no association (205,206). A meta-analysis of
four trials of patients undergoing IVF found an increased risk
of pregnancy loss with the presence of thyroid antibodies
(RR 1.99, 95% CI 1.42–2.79) (207).
Question 55: Should women undergoing IVF
be screened for TPO antibodies before
or during pregnancy?
Negro et al. (208) performed a prospective placebo-
controlled intervention trial of LT4 in TPOAbþ women
undergoing
assisted
reproduction
technologies.
Though
underpowered for its proposed endpoint, no difference in
pregnancy loss was observed. Patients undergoing assisted
reproductive procedures for infertility may have a number of
reasons for infertility or subfertility, and this may explain the
conflicting data.

LT4 therapy in euthyroid TAbþ women undergoing as-
sisted reproduction technologies. Level I-USPSTF
Question 56: Is there an association between
thyroid antibodies and preterm delivery
in euthyroid women?
Preterm delivery, or birth prior to 37 weeks, affects 12.3% of
pregnancies in the United States (209). It remains one of the
most prevalent and morbid perinatal complications. It is the
leading cause of neonatal death and the second leading cause
of infant death (210). The cost of preterm delivery to the health
care system is enormous (211). Preterm birth has remained
difficult to predict, prevent, and treat primarily because there
are multiple potential causes and pathways that end in pre-
mature labor (212). Examples include infection, trauma, cer-
vical insufficiency, premature rupture of membranes, and
maternal medical conditions.
Medical conditions such as hypertension and diabetes have
been associated with a risk of preterm delivery, either due
to the spontaneous onset of labor or from complications
prompting medically indicated delivery. Patients with un-
controlled hyperthyroidism also have higher rates of preterm
delivery, most commonly due to medical intervention
(80,213). The most severe example of uncontrolled hyper-
thyroidism, thyroid storm, results in high rates of preterm
labor and delivery (214).
The relationship of thyroid antibodies and preterm deliv-
ery has also been investigated. Glinoer et al. (183) reported in a
prospective cohort that women who were positive for either
TPOAb or TgAb had a significantly increased prevalence of
preterm birth (16% vs. 8%, p < 0.005). Ghafoor et al. (215)
evaluated 1500 euthyroid women and found an increase in
preterm delivery in TPOAbþ women as compared with wo-
men who were TPOAb� (26.8% vs. 8.0%, p < 0.01). In con-
trast, Iijima et al. (182) did not find an increased risk for
preterm birth in women positive for seven different auto-
antibodies and thyroid antibodies. This study had an un-
usually low rate of preterm birth in both study and control
groups (3% vs. 3.1 %). Interestingly, Haddow et al. (216) re-
ported a significant increase in preterm premature rupture of
the membranes in TAbþ women but not in preterm birth
among women who were positive for TPOAb and TgAb in the
first trimester. Their data revealed a positive association be-
tween very preterm delivery (<32 weeks) and thyroid anti-
body positivity (OR 1.73, 95% CI 1.00–2.97). However, the
adjusted odds ratio for very preterm delivery and thyroid
antibody positivity failed to reach statistical significance
(adjusted OR 1.70, 95% CI 0.98–2.94).
Question 57: Should women be screened for
thyroid antibodies before or during pregnancy
with the goal of treating TAb+ euthyroid women
with LT4 to decrease the rate of preterm delivery?
Negro et al. (28) reported an increased risk of preterm
delivery among euthyroid TPOAbþ women compared
with euthyroid TPOAb� women in the only published pro-
spective interventional trial to date (22.4% vs. 8.2%, p < .01).
The TPOAbþ subjects were then randomized to either treat-
ment with LT4 or no treatment, with the dose based on TSH
level. The treated group had a significantly lower rate of
preterm delivery than did the untreated group (7% vs. 22.4%,
p < .05).

screening for thyroid antibodies in the first trimester of
pregnancy, or treating TAbþ euthyroid women with LT4,

Thyroid Nodules and Thyroid Cancer
Thyroid nodules and thyroid cancer discovered during
pregnancy present unique challenges to both the clinician and
the mother. A careful balance is required between making a
definitive diagnosis and instituting treatment, while avoiding
interventions that may adversely impact the mother, the
health of the fetus, or the maintenance of the pregnancy.
Question 58: What is the frequency of thyroid nodules
during pregnancy?
Three studies have evaluated the prevalence of thyroid
nodules during pregnancy, the impact of pregnancy on nod-
ular size, and the percentage of women who have new nod-
ules detected during pregnancy. All three studies were
performed in areas with mild to moderate iodine deficiency
1100
STAGNARO-GREEN ET AL.
 (Brussels, China, and Germany). The prevalence of thyroid
nodules varied between 3% and 21% (183,217,218) and in-
creased with increasing parity (9.4% without a prior preg-
nancy, 20.7% with one prior pregnancy, 20.7% with two prior
pregnancies, and 33.9% with three or more prior pregnancies)
(217). In the Belgian study, 60% of the nodules doubled in size
during pregnancy yet remained between 5 and 12 mm (183).
No increase throughout pregnancy was noted in the maxi-
mum diameter of the dominant nodule in the Chinese study
(mean diameter was 5.1, 5.1, and 5.5 mm, in the first, second,
and third trimesters, respectively). However, an increase in
nodular volume was reported during pregnancy with a return
to first trimester volumes by the third postpartum month
(218). The studies in Belgium and Germany reported that
11%–20% of women with a nodule detected in the first tri-
mester of pregnancy developed a second nodule through the
course of pregnancy (183,218). Increasing age is associated
with an increase in the percentage of women who have thy-
roid nodules present during pregnancy (183,218).
Question 59: What is the frequency of thyroid cancer
in women with thyroid nodules discovered during
pregnancy?
Data regarding the prevalence of thyroid cancer derive
from three retrospective studies performed at three tertiary
referral centers (Mayo Clinic, George Washington Uni-
versity Hospital, and Mount Sinai Hospital-Toronto), one
prospective study, and a retrospective study of the Cali-
fornia Cancer Registry. The research performed at the re-
ferral centers revealed a 15% (6/40, Mayo Clinic) (219), 12%
(7/57, George Washington Hospital) (220), and 43% (7/16,
Mount Sinai Hospital-Toronto) (221) rate of thyroid malig-
nancy. All three studies are limited by two major methodo-
logical flaws. The first, and most problematic, is selection
bias. The population study consisted of women referred for
diagnosis and treatment at major referral centers. As such
they are not representative of the population of pregnant
women with thyroid nodules detected during pregnancy.
Instead, they represent a select group of women referred to a
tertiary medical center due to physician concern of thyroid
malignancy. Consequently, they overrepresent the preva-
lence of thyroid malignancy during pregnancy. Secondly,
each study was retrospective in nature; therefore, neither the
accuracy of the diagnosis nor the completeness of case
identification within the database could be verified. The lone
prospective study investigated the prevalence of thyroid
cancer during pregnancy in 212 Chinese women. The study
found a 15.3% (34/221) rate of thyroid nodules and a 0% rate
of malignancy. Interpreting these data is hampered by
the limited number of women enrolled in the study (218). The
final study consisted of a population-based retrospective
analysis of all obstetrical deliveries in California between
the years 1991 through 1999 identified by cross-referencing
maternal/neonatal hospital discharges in California and the
California Cancer Registry (n ¼ 4,846,505 women). A prev-
alence of thyroid cancer in pregnancy of 14.4/100,000 was
reported, with papillary cancer being the most frequent
pathological type (222). Timing of diagnosis of the thyroid
malignancy was as follows: 3.3/100,000 cases diagnosed
before delivery, 0.3/100,000 at delivery, and 10.8/100,000
within 1 year postpartum.
Question 60: What is the optimal diagnostic strategy
for thyroid nodules detected during pregnancy?
History and physical examination.
The patient with a
thyroid nodule should be asked about a family history of
benign or malignant thyroid disease, familial medullary thy-
roid carcinoma, multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN 2),
familial papillary thyroid carcinoma, and familial polyposis
coli (223,224). Previous disease or treatment involving the
neck (history of head and neck irradiation during childhood),
rapidity of onset, and rate of nodule growth should be
documented (225). A progressive nodule growth warrants a
fine-needle aspiration (FNA), while persistent cough or dys-
phonia may suggest a malignant lesion (224). Thorough pal-
pation of the thyroid and neck inspection for cervical nodes
are essential (226).
Ultrasound.
Thyroid ultrasound is the most accurate tool
for detecting thyroid nodules, determining their features,
monitoring their growth, and evaluating cervical lymph
nodes. Nodules smaller than 10 mm do not require a FNA
unless suspicious for malignancy on ultrasound or clinical
grounds (227). Ultrasonographic features suggestive of ma-
lignancy include a hypoechoic pattern, irregular margins,
chaotic intranodular vascular spots, nodules that are taller
than they are wide, and microcalcifications (228). The pres-
ence of two or more suspicious sonographic criteria reliably
identifies most neoplastic lesions of the thyroid gland (87%–
93% of cases) (229). Ultrasonographic features suggestive of
malignancy or with extracapsular growth or metastatic lymph
nodes warrant FNA evaluation. FNA of nodules that appear
benign on ultrasound can be deferred until postpartum.
Thyroid function tests.
All women with a thyroid nodule
should have a TSH and FT4 performed (6,230,231). Thyroid
function tests are usually normal in women with thyroid
cancer.
& RECOMMENDATION 46
The optimal diagnostic strategy for thyroid nodules de-
tected during pregnancy is based on risk stratification. All
women should have the following: a complete history and
clinical examination, serum TSH testing, and ultrasound of
the neck. Level A-USPSTF
As with the general population, the routine measurement
of calcitonin remains controversial (232). Calcitonin mea-
surement should be performed in pregnant women with a
family history of medullary thyroid carcinoma or MEN 2.
However, the utility of measuring calcitonin in all pregnant
women with thyroid nodules has not been evaluated in the
literature. The pentagastrin stimulation test is contraindicated
in pregnancy (233).
& RECOMMENDATION 47
The utility of measuring calcitonin in pregnant women
with thyroid nodules is unknown. Level I-USPSTF
Fine-needle aspiration.
FNA is a safe diagnostic tool in
pregnancy and may be performed in any trimester (229,234–
242). Two retrospective case series of FNAs performed dur-
ing pregnancy, involving a total of 94 patients, have been

 published. In the cases in which surgery was performed,
pathological examination of the specimens confirmed the di-
agnosis of all FNAs classified by cytology as either benign or
malignant. Six of the 16 (37.5%) cases reported by cytology as
suspicious for malignancy were found to be malignant at
pathological examination (219,220). Pregnancy does not ap-
pear to increase the difficulty of making a cytological diag-
nosis of thyroid tissue obtained by FNA. There have been no
prospective studies which have evaluated the reliability of
FNA in pregnancy.

Thyroid or lymph node FNA confers no additional risks to
a pregnancy. Level A-USPSTF
& RECOMMENDATION 49
Thyroid nodules discovered during pregnancy that have
suspicious ultrasound features, as delineated by the 2009
ATA guidelines, should be considered for FNA. In in-
stances in which nodules are likely benign, FNA may be
deferred until after delivery based on patients’ preference.

Radionuclide scanning.
The use of radionuclide scanning
is contraindicated during pregnancy (243–245). Inadvertent
scanning performed prior to 12 weeks gestation does not ap-
pear to damage the fetal thyroid.
& RECOMMENDATION 50
The use of radioiodine imaging and/or uptake determina-
tion or therapeutic dosing is contraindicated during preg-
nancy. Inadvertent use of radioiodine prior to 12 weeks of
gestation does not appear to damage the fetal thyroid.

Question 61: Does pregnancy impact the prognosis
of thyroid carcinoma?
Seven studies have compared the prognosis of women with
differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) diagnosed either during
pregnancy or within the first postpartum year to women di-
agnosed with thyroid carcinoma at another time period
(controls) (246–252). In six of the studies the prognosis, de-
fined as either tumor recurrence or death, of women diag-
nosed during pregnancy/postpartum did not differ from
controls. The studies ranged in size from 9 to 595 thyroid
cancer cases diagnosed during pregnancy/postpartum and
462 to 2270 controls. Prognosis in women diagnosed with
thyroid carcinoma while pregnant did not differ based on
whether surgery was performed during pregnancy or de-
ferred until postpartum. In contrast with these studies, a 2010
publication reported that women diagnosed with DTC during
pregnancy or within 1 year following delivery (n ¼ 15), had a
poorer prognosis in terms of persistence and relapse of
disease
compared
with
women
diagnosed
with
well-
differentiated thyroid cancer either prior to pregnancy
(n ¼ 61) or 1 year following delivery (n ¼ 47) (252). Estrogen
receptor a was present in the tumors of the majority of women
diagnosed during pregnancy/postpartum as compared with
the other two groups, which may indicate that the poorer
prognosis is related to estrogen-mediated growth.
In conclusion, the majority of studies indicate that preg-
nancy does not worsen the prognosis in women diagnosed
with DTC. Surgery for DTC diagnosed during pregnancy can
be postponed until postpartum without impacting tumor re-
currence or mortality. It should be noted that none of the
studies were randomized controlled trials, all were retro-
spective, and the size of many of the studies was limited. The
impact on prognosis of estrogen receptor a positivity requires
further evaluation. The impact of pregnancy on women with
medullary or anaplastic carcinoma is unknown.
& RECOMMENDATION 51
Because the prognosis of women with well-differentiated
thyroid cancer identified but not treated during pregnancy
is similar to that of nonpregnant patients, surgery may be
generally deferred until postpartum. Level B-USPSTF
& RECOMMENDATION 52
The impact of pregnancy on women with medullary car-
cinoma is unknown. Surgery is recommended during
pregnancy in the presence of a large primary tumor or
extensive lymph node metastases. Level I-USPSTF
Question 62: What are the perioperative risks
to mother and fetus of surgery for thyroid cancer
during pregnancy?
Surgery is the treatment of choice for DTC. Deferring sur-
gery until postpartum has not been associated with a worse
prognosis, so it is imperative to assess maternal and neonatal
complications before advising an operation during pregnancy.
Between 1986 and 2008 nine studies evaluated the impact of
thyroidectomy during pregnancy on a total of 113 patients
(study size ranged from 1 to 96) (219,223–227,253–255). The
majority, but not all, of the operations were performed in the
second trimester. There were no maternal or fetal complications
in any of the studies. Recently (2009), a population-based study
compared 201 pregnant women who underwent thyroid and
parathyroid surgery during pregnancy with 31,155 similarly
treated nonpregnant women (256). One hundred sixty-five
operations were thyroid related and 46% of the women had
thyroid cancer. Pregnant patients had a higher rate of endocrine
and general complications, longer lengths of stay, and higher
hospital costs. The fetal and maternal complication rates were
5.5% and 4.5%, respectively. Interpretation of the results of this
study is difficult because there were substantial baseline dif-
ferences between the two groups. Pregnant women were more
likely to have either urgent or emergent admissions and had a
higher percentage of government insurance. In situations in
which surgery during pregnancy is indicated or desired, it
should be performed in the second trimester in order to mini-
mize complications to both the mother and fetus (altered or-
ganogenesis and spontaneous abortion in the first trimester;
preterm labor and delivery in the third trimester) (257). The risk
of post-thyroidectomy maternal hypothyroidism and hypo-
parathyroidism should also be considered.
& RECOMMENDATION 53
Surgery for thyroid carcinoma during the second trimester
of pregnancy has not been demonstrated to be associated
with increased maternal or fetal risk. Level B-USPSTF

 Question 63: How should benign thyroid nodules
be managed during pregnancy?
Although pregnancy is a risk factor for progression of
nodular thyroid disease, there is no evidence demonstrating
that LT4 is effective in decreasing the size or arresting the
growth of thyroid nodules during pregnancy. Hence, LT4
suppressive therapy for thyroid nodules is not recommended
during pregnancy. Nodules that on FNA were benign but
show rapid growth or ultrasound changes suspicious for
malignancy should have a repeat FNA and be considered for
surgical intervention. In the absence of rapid growth, nodules
with biopsies that are either benign or indeterminate do not
require surgery during pregnancy (258).
Surgery for benign nodules must be considered in cases of
large nodules with tracheal or esophageal compression.
& RECOMMENDATION 54
Pregnant women with thyroid nodules that are read as
benign on FNA cytology do not require surgery during
pregnancy except in cases of rapid nodule growth and/or if
severe compressive symptoms develop. Postpartum, nod-
ules should be managed according to the 2009 ATA
guidelines. Level B-USPSTF
Question 64: How should DTC be managed
during pregnancy?
Recently published ATA Guidelines (258) recommend that
a nodule with cytology indicating papillary thyroid carci-
noma discovered early in pregnancy should be monitored
sonographically. If it grows substantially by 24 weeks gesta-
tion (50% in volume and 20% in diameter in two dimensions),
surgery should be performed. However, if it remains stable by
midgestation or if it is diagnosed in the second half of preg-
nancy, surgery may be performed after delivery. In patients
with more advanced disease, surgery in the second trimester
is a viable option.
If surgery is deferred until postpartum, thyroid hormone
suppression therapy may be considered for patients with an
FNA biopsy diagnostic of a DTC (258). The goal of LT4 ther-
apy is to keep TSH in the low-normal range of 0.1–1.5 mU/L.
& RECOMMENDATION 55
When a decision has been made to defer surgery for well-
differentiated thyroid carcinoma until after delivery, neck
ultrasounds should be performed during each trimester to
assess for rapid tumor growth, which may indicate the
need for surgery. Level I-USPSTF
& RECOMMENDATION 56
Surgery in women with well-differentiated thyroid carci-
noma may be deferred until postpartum without adversely
affecting the patient’s prognosis. However, if substantial
growth of the well-differentiated thyroid carcinoma occurs
or the emergence of lymph node metastases prior to
midgestation
occurs,
then
surgery
is
recommended.
Level B-USPSTF
& RECOMMENDATION 57
Thyroid hormone therapy may be considered in preg-
nant women who have deferred surgery for well-
differentiated thyroid carcinoma until postpartum. The
goal of LT4 therapy is a serum TSH level of 0.1–1.5 mIU/L.
Level I-USPSTF
Question 65: How should suspicious thyroid nodules
be managed during pregnancy?
There have been no prospective studies evaluating the
outcome and prognosis of women with an FNA biopsy that is
interpreted as being suspicious for thyroid cancer. Because
30% of suspicious thyroid nodules are malignant and the
prognosis for DTC diagnosed during pregnancy is not ad-
versely impacted by performing surgery postpartum, it is
reasonable to defer surgery until after delivery. Because the
majority of these women will have benign nodules, LT4
therapy during pregnancy is not recommended.
& RECOMMENDATION 58
Pregnant patients with an FNA sample that is suspicious
for thyroid cancer do not require surgery while pregnant
except in cases of rapid nodular growth and/or the ap-
pearance of lymph node metastases. Thyroid hormone
therapy is not recommended. Level I-USPSTF
Figure 1 presents an algorithm for the work-up and treat-
ment of a thyroid nodule detected during pregnancy.
Question 66: What are the TSH goals during pregnancy
for women with previously treated thyroid cancer
and who are on LT4 therapy?
Based on studies that have demonstrated a lack of maternal
or neonatal complications with subclinical hyperthyroidism it
is reasonable to assume that the preconception degree of TSH
suppression can be safely maintained throughout pregnancy.
The appropriate level of TSH suppression depends upon
preconception evidence of residual or recurrent disease. Ac-
cording to the ATA management guidelines for DTC (258)
and the European Thyroid Association (ETA) consensus (259),
serum TSH should be maintained indefinitely below 0.1 mU/
L in patients with persistent disease. In patients who are
clinically and biochemically free of disease but who presented
with a high risk tumor, TSH suppression should be main-
tained with serum TSH levels between 0.1 and 0.5 mU/L. In
low-risk patients free of disease, TSH may be kept within the
low normal range (0.3–1.5 mU/L). Finally, in patients who
have not undergone remnant ablation, who are clinically free
of disease and have undetectable suppressed serum Tg and
normal neck ultrasound, serum TSH may be allowed to re-
main in the low normal range (0.3–1.5 mU/L).
The main challenge in caring for women with previously
treated DTC is maintaining the TSH level within the precon-
ception range. In a recent report (56) thyroid cancer patients
required smaller dose increases than patients who had
undergone thyroid ablation for benign thyroid disorders or
patients with primary hypothyroidism. On average, the cu-
mulative LT4 dose increased by 9% in the first trimester, 21% in
the second trimester, and 26% in the third trimester, with the
majority of patients (65%) requiring LT4 adjustments during
the second trimester. Patients require careful monitoring of
thyroid function tests in order to avoid hypothyroidism.
Thyroid function should be evaluated as soon as preg-
nancy is confirmed. The adequacy of LT4 treatment should
be checked 4 weeks after any LT4 dose change. The same
PREGNANCY AND POSTPARTUM THYROID MANAGEMENT GUIDELINES

 laboratory should be utilized to monitor TSH and Tg levels
before, during, and after pregnancy.
& RECOMMENDATION 59
The preconception TSH goal in women with DTC,
which is determined by risk stratification, should be
maintained during pregnancy. TSH should be monitored
approximately every 4 weeks until 16–20 weeks of ges-
tation and once between 26 and 32 weeks of gestation.

 subsequent pregnancies has been evaluated by Sawka et al.
(260) and Garsi et al. (261) (the latter collected 2673 pregnan-
cies, 483 of which occurred after RAI treatment). Neither
study found an increased risk of infertility, miscarriage, still-
birth, neonatal mortality, congenital malformations, preterm
birth, low birth weight, death during the first year of life, or
cancer in the offspring.
The potential for an increased risk of miscarriage in the
months following RAI administration may derive from sub-
optimal thyroid hormonal control. Therefore it seems reason-
able to wait a minimum of 6 months following RAI ablative
therapy before conceiving. This would help ensure that LT4
replacement therapy is optimal at the time of conception.
& RECOMMENDATION 60
There is no evidence that previous exposure to radioiodine
affects the outcomes of subsequent pregnancies and off-
spring. Pregnancy should be deferred for 6 months fol-
lowing RAI treatment. LT4 dosing should be stabilized
following RAI treatment before pregnancy is attempted.
Level B-USPSTF
Question 68: Does pregnancy increase the risk
of DTC recurrence?
Five studies have evaluated the impact of pregnancy after a
woman has been treated for DTC. Rosvoll and Winship (262)
evaluated 60 women with a history of DTC who had subse-
quent pregnancies. No tumor recurrence was seen in the 38
women who had been disease free for between 2 and 15 years,
and pregnancy did not accelerate tumor growth in the 22
women who had stable or slowly progressive disease. Hill
et al. (263) found no difference in thyroid cancer recurrence
rate in 70 women who had one or more pregnancies following
initial diagnosis of DTC and 109 women who had no subse-
quent pregnancies. Leboeuf et al. (264) reported on 36 women
who became pregnant a median of 4.3 years after initial
treatment for DTC (264). The mean suppressed Tg after de-
livery was not significantly different than the prepartum va-
lue. However, eight women had Tg values after delivery more
than 20% higher than before pregnancy (three with known
disease, five with no clinical evidence of disease). No evidence
of recurrence was detected in the early postpartum period in
women with negative prepregnancy neck ultrasound and
serum Tg < 3.2 ng/mL. Disease progression was documented
by the enlargement of a previously stable cervical node in one
patient and by a marked rise in serum Tg without evidence of
structural disease progression in another patient with previ-
ously stable lung metastasis. Rosario et al. (265) reported that
pregnancy did not result in cancer recurrence in any of 64
women previously treated for DTC who were thyroid cancer
free at the time of pregnancy (as determined by Tg levels,
ultrasound, and physical examination). Hirsch and colleagues
(266) evaluated 63 women who had given birth after receiving
treatment for DTC. Twenty-three of 63 had more than one
pregnancy, for a total of 90 births. The mean time to the first
delivery after completion of thyroid cancer treatment was
5.1 � 4.4 years; mean duration of follow-up after the first de-
livery was 4.8 � 3.8 years. Six women had evidence of thyroid
cancer progression that was independent of pathological
staging, interval from diagnosis to pregnancy, TSH level
during pregnancy, or Tg level before conception. The authors
did, however, find a positive correlation of cancer progression
with persistence of thyroid cancer before pregnancy.
Pregnancy does not pose a risk for tumor recurrence in
women without structural or biochemical disease present
prior to the pregnancy. However, pregnancy may represent a
stimulus to thyroid cancer growth in patients with known
structural or biochemical disease present at the time of
conception.
Question 69: What type of monitoring should be
performed during pregnancy in a patient who has
already been treated for DTC prior to pregnancy?
& RECOMMENDATION 61
Ultrasound and Tg monitoring during pregnancy in pa-
tients with a history of previously treated DTC is not re-
quired for low-risk patients with no Tg or structural
evidence of disease prior to pregnancy. Level B-USPSTF
& RECOMMENDATION 62
Ultrasound monitoring should be performed each trimester
during pregnancy in patients with previously treated DTC
and who have high levels of Tg or evidence of persistent
structural disease prior to pregnancy. Level B-USPSTF
Postpartum Thyroiditis
Question 70: What is the definition of PPT
and what are its clinical implications?
PPT is the occurrence of thyroid dysfunction in the first
postpartum year in women who were euthyroid prior to
pregnancy (267). In its classical form, transient thyrotoxicosis is
followed by transient hypothyroidism with a return to the eu-
thyroid state by the end of the initial postpartum year (118). The
clinical course of PPT varies, with 25% of cases presenting in the
classical form, 32% with isolated thyrotoxicosis, and 43% with
isolated hypothyroidism (268). The thyrotoxic phase of PPT
typically occurs between 2 and 6 months postpartum, but epi-
sodes have been reported as late as 1 year following delivery.
All episodes of thyrotoxicosis resolve spontaneously. The hy-
pothyroid phase of PPT occurs from 3 to 12 months postpartum
with 10%–20% of cases resulting in permanent hypothyroidism.
It should be noted, however, that a recently published article
reported that 50% of women with PPT remained hypothyroid at
the end of the first postpartum year (269).
Question 71: What is the etiology of PPT?
PPT is an autoimmune disorder associated with the pres-
ence of thyroid antibodies (TPO and Tg antibodies), lym-
phocyte abnormalities, complement activation, increased
levels of IgG1, increased natural killer cell activity, and spe-
cific HLA haplotypes (270–272). The occurrence of PPT post-
partum reflects the immune suppression that occurs during
pregnancy followed by the rebound of the immune system in
the postpartum period.
Question 72: Are there predictors of PPT?
PPT will develop in 33%–50% of women who present with
thyroid antibodies in the first trimester, conferring a relative
risk of PPT of between 10 and 59 compared with women
who are negative for thyroid antibodies (273). The risk of PPT
PREGNANCY AND POSTPARTUM THYROID MANAGEMENT GUIDELINES
1105
 increases as the titer of thyroid antibodies in the first trimester
increases. Although thyroid hypoechogenecity predates the
hormonal changes of PPT, it is not of clinical utility in pre-
dicting or diagnosing PPT (274).
Question 73: What is the prevalence of PPT?
The prevalence of PPT is approximately 8.1% and varies
markedly in different studies (the range is between 1.1% and
16.7%) (275). Women with other autoimmune disorders have an
increased risk of PPT. Specifically, the prevalence of PPT is 25%
with Type 1 diabetes mellitus (276,277), 25% with chronic viral
hepatitis (278), 14% with systemic lupus erythematosus (279), and
44% with a prior history of Graves’ disease (280). Individuals who
had PPT in a prior episode and who returned to the euthyroid
state have a 70% chance of developing PPT in a subsequent
pregnancy (281). Women on LT4 therapy secondary to Ha-
shimoto’s thyroiditis predating pregnancy may develop PPT if
their thyroid gland is not completely atrophic (282). Cases of PPT
have been reported following miscarriage, but the prevalence of
thyroid dysfunction following pregnancy loss is unknown (283).
Question 74: What symptoms are associated with PPT?
Most women are asymptomatic during the thyrotoxic
phase of PPT. This reflects the degree of increase in thyroid
hormone, which is typically mild. Nevertheless, in prospec-
tive studies symptoms more common in women during the
hyperthyroid phase of PPT, compared with euthyroid post-
partum controls, include irritability, heat intolerance, fatigue,
and palpitations (267,284–286). It is more common for women
in the hypothyroid phase of PPT to be symptomatic. Symp-
toms experienced more frequently during the hypothyroid
phase of PPT, compared with euthyroid postpartum controls,
include cold intolerance, dry skin, lack of energy, impaired
concentration, and aches and pains (267,284–286).
Question 75: Is PPT associated with depression?
Studies evaluating the relationship of PPT to postpartum
depression have yielded mixed results, with some (287) but not
all (288) studies reporting a significant association. Two studies
have reported a significant association between thyroid anti-
bodies and depression (289,290), irrespective of thyroid function,
whereas one study showed no association between the presence
of microsomal antibodies and postpartum depression (291). A
prospective trial of LT4 intervention postpartum versus placebo,
in TPOAbþ women, resulted in no difference in rates of post-
partum depression between the two groups (292).
& RECOMMENDATION 63
Women with postpartum depression should have TSH,
FT4, and TPOAb tests performed. Level B-USPSTF
Question 76: What is the treatment for the thyrotoxic
phase of PPT?
There have been no prospective studies evaluating when
and how to treat PPT. Treatment of the thyrotoxic phase is
guided by its transitory nature. ATDs (PTU and MMI) are
ineffective in treating the thyrotoxic phase of PPT because it is
a destructive thyroiditis. Clinical symptoms increased in the
thyrotoxic phase, as compared with controls, are palpitations,
heat intolerance, and nervousness (284,286). Symptoms are
typically mild and frequently do not require intervention. The
thyrotoxic phase of PPT must be differentiated from recurrent
or de novo Graves’ disease.
& RECOMMENDATION 64
During the thyrotoxic phase of PPT, symptomatic women
may be treated with beta blockers. Propranolol at the
lowest possible dose to alleviate symptoms is the treatment
of choice. Therapy is typically required for a few months.
Level B-USPSTF
& RECOMMENDATION 65
ATDs are not recommended for the treatment of the thyr-
otoxic phase of PPT. Level D-USPSTF
Question 77: Once the thyrotoxic phase of PPT
resolves, how often should TSH be measured to screen
for the hypothyroid phase?
& RECOMMENDATION 66
Following the resolution of the thyrotoxic phase of PPT,
TSH should be tested every 2 months (or if symptoms are
present) until 1 year postpartum to screen for the hypo-
thyroid phase. Level B-USPSTF
Question 78: What is the treatment for the hypothyroid
phase of PPT?
The hypothyroid phase of PPT is associated with increased
symptoms including impaired concentration, carelessness,
and an increase in total complaints when compared with
postpartum euthyroid women (285).
& RECOMMENDATION 67
Women who are symptomatic with hypothyroidism in PPT
should either have their TSH level retested in 4–8 weeks or
be started on LT4 (if symptoms are severe, if conception is
being attempted, or if the patient desires therapy). Women
who are asymptomatic with hypothyroidism in PPT should
have their TSH level retested in 4–8 weeks. Level B-USPSTF
& RECOMMENDATION 68
Women who are hypothyroid with PPT and attempting
pregnancy should be treated with LT4. Level A-USPSTF
Question 79: How long should LT4 be continued
in women with PPT?
The length of time that LT4 should be continued once ini-
tiated has not been systematically evaluated. Guiding prin-
ciples are to maintain a euthyroid state while a woman is
attempting
pregnancy,
pregnant,
or
breastfeeding,
and
eventually to determine if the hypothyroid phase of PPT was
transitory or permanent.
& RECOMMENDATION 69
If LT4 is initiated for PPT, future discontinuation of therapy
should be attempted. Tapering of treatment can be begun
6–12 months after the initiation of treatment. Tapering
of LT4 should be avoided when a woman is actively
attempting pregnancy, is breastfeeding, or is pregnant.

 Question 80: How often should screening be performed
after the hypothyroid phase of PPT resolves?
The impact of PPT on long-term thyroid function has been
evaluated in six studies (284,293–297). The data demonstrate
that within 1 year, 10%–20% of women who were euthyroid
following their initial hypothyroid phase of PPT develop
permanent hypothyroidism. Recent data from a large-scale
prospective study of 169 women with PPT demonstrated that
82% of the women had a hypothyroid phase at some point
during the first year and, at the end of the first year, 54% of the
169 women were persistently hypothyroid (269). Factors as-
sociated with an increased risk of developing permanent
hypothyroidism are mulitparity, hypoechogenecity on ultra-
sound, the severity of the initial hypothyroidism, TPO anti-
body titer, maternal age, and a history of miscarriage.
& RECOMMENDATION 70
Women with a prior history of PPT should have an annual
TSH test performed to evaluate for permanent hypothy-
roidism. Level A-USPSTF
Figure 2 presents an algorithm for the treatment and
monitoring of PPT.
Question 81: Does treatment of TAb+ euthyroid
women with LT4 or iodine during pregnancy
prevent PPT?
Two prospective randomized placebo-controlled con-
trolled trials have evaluated the efficacy of iodine or LT4
treatment during pregnancy to prevent the development of
PPT in TAbþ women. Neither intervention decreased the
prevalence of PPT (298,299). Levothyroxine diminished the
degree of hypothyroidism during the hypothyroid phase of
PPT and iodine appeared to enhance thyroid dysfunction.
& RECOMMENDATION 71
Treatment of TAbþ euthyroid pregnant woman with either
LT4 or iodine to prevent PPT is ineffective and is not re-
commended. Level D-USPSTF
Question 82: Does treatment of TAb+ euthyroid women
with selenium during pregnancy prevent PPT?
In 2007 Negro et al. (65) evaluated the impact of selenium
administration in preventing PPT in 151 Italian women who
were positive for thyroid antibodies during pregnancy. Se-
venty-seven women received 200 mg/day of selenium during
pregnancy and the postpartum period and 74 women re-
ceived a placebo. The prevalence of PPT was significantly
decreased in women receiving selenium as compared with
women in the placebo group (28.6% vs. 48.6% p < 0.01). Be-
cause only a single trial has documented a benefit of selenium
supplementation to prevent PPT, there is insufficient evidence
to recommend selenium supplementation during pregnancy
in TAbþ women (see Recommendation 21).
Thyroid Function Screening in Pregnancy
Question 83: Should all pregnant women be screened
for serum TSH level in the first trimester of pregnancy?
The question of whether all pregnant women should be
screened in order to identify and treat thyroid dysfunction has
been extremely controversial. In order for any screening
program to be worthwhile, the condition of interest must be
prevalent in asymptomatic individuals, there must be a reli-
able and readily available test to identify the condition,
and identification of the condition must result in a beneficial
intervention. Finally, the screening and intervention strategy
must be shown to be cost-effective.
U.S. data suggest that approximately 2%–3% of pregnant
women will have an elevated serum TSH level at the time of
routine screening. Of the screened women, 0.3%–0.5% will
have OH and 2%–2.5% will have SCH (36,300). The prevalence
of both OH and SCH increases with patient age and is also
likely to be higher in iodine-deficient regions. Hyperthyroid-
ism is less common, occurring in approximately 0.1%–0.4% of
pregnant women (96). The prevalence of thyroid dysfunction
in pregnant women is similar to the prevalence of other dis-
orders for which universal screening has been advocated.
Serum TSH testing is relatively inexpensive, is widely
available, and is a reliable test in pregnancy, assuming that
trimester-specific reference ranges are applied.
The adverse maternal and fetal effects associated with un-
diagnosed and untreated overt thyroid dysfunction (both
overt hypothyroidism and overt hyperthyroidism) in pregnant
women have been clearly delineated as described in previous
sections. Subclinical maternal hyperthyroidism has not been
associated with adverse maternal or fetal outcomes (25).
The maternal and fetal consequences of SCH in pregnancy
are less well defined, although the majority of studies report
an association between SCH and adverse pregnancy out-
comes. A retrospective study by Casey et al. described a two-
to threefold increased risk of placental abruption and preterm
delivery before 34 weeks in untreated women with SCH
compared with euthyroid controls (35). Abalovich et al. (38)
reported that inadequate LT4 treatment in women with either
OH or SCH was associated with significant increases in the
risks for miscarriage and preterm delivery. Allan et al. (36)
described a fourfold increased rate of fetal death in mothers
with hypothyroidism compared with a euthyroid control
population. Negro et al. (41) recently noted an increased
miscarriage rate in TPOAb� women with serum TSH values
between 2.5 and 5.0 mIU/L. However, studies have not
consistently demonstrated adverse obstetrical outcomes in
pregnant women with SCH. Cleary-Goldman et al. (43) did
not find any association between maternal SCH and adverse
pregnancy outcomes in a secondary analysis of a cohort of
10,990 women. Similarly, Mannisto et al. (44,45) found no
association between SCH and adverse pregnancy outcomes in
a large retrospective cohort.
Several studies suggest that mild maternal hypothyroidism
is associated with adverse fetal neurocognitive outcomes. In a
large case–control study Haddow et al. (37) demonstrated that
at age 7–9 years children of mothers with untreated TSH el-
evations in pregnancy had IQ scores 7 points lower than
children of euthyroid mothers. Li et al. (51) noted decreased IQ
not only in the offspring of mothers with hypothyroidism or
hypothyroxinemia during the first trimester, but also in those
mothers who had detectable thyroid antibodies without thy-
roid dysfunction. Pop et al. (301) reported a decrease in psy-
chomotor testing among offspring born to women with serum
FT4 in the lowest 10th percentile, most of whom had normal

 cognitive outcomes in offspring, but that maternal hy-
pothyroxinemia was associated with a higher risk of expres-
sive language and nonverbal cognitive delays (52).
Only one prospective trial to date has demonstrated that LT4
treatment of subclinically hypothyroid women who were
TPOAbþ resulted in improved obstetric outcomes. Negro et al.
(40) randomized 4562 first-trimester pregnant women to a case-
finding vs. universal thyroid screening strategy. Women from
the case-finding group considered to be at high risk for thyroid
dysfunction and all women from the universal screening group
had thyroid function tests ascertained during the first trimester,
and those who were TPOAbþ with TSH >2.5 mIU/L were
treated with LT4. Women in the case-finding group who were
considered low-risk had serum samples drawn in early preg-
nancy, but measurement of TSH in these samples was delayed
until after delivery, and thus no LT4 was provided for women of
this group. Women who were TPOAb� with TSH levels be-
tween 2.5 and 5.0 mIU/L were not treated in this investigation,
and therefore no conclusions can be drawn about this subgroup.
While the universal screening approach did not result in an
overall decrease in adverse outcomes, treatment of thyroid
dysfunction, as defined as a TSH >2.5 mIU/L in TPOAbþ
women, was associated with a significantly lower risk of at least
one of the following adverse obstetrical outcomes: miscarriage,
hypertension, preeclampsia, gestational diabetes, placental
abruption, cesarean delivery, congestive heart failure, preterm

The Controlled Antenatal Thyroid Screening Study was
designed to determine whether LT4 treatment for hypothy-
roid or hypothyroxinemic pregnant women improves child
intellectual development. A total of 22,000 women with sin-
gleton pregnancies were enrolled at <16 weeks gestation
(mean gestational age 12.5 weeks) and were randomized to
immediate assay of thyroid function, with LT4 treatment for
elevated serum TSH (>97.5th percentile) and/or low serum
FT4 (<2.5th percentile), versus storage of blood samples for
measurement of thyroid function only after completion of
pregnancy. Preliminary results were given as an oral pre-
sentation at the International Thyroid Congress in Paris,
France, in September 2010 (302). At age 3 years, there was no
difference in IQ between the children of 390 treated mothers
compared with 404 untreated mothers. Fifteen percent of
children in the control group had an IQ <85 compared with
11.5% in the screened and treated group, but this difference
was not significant ( p ¼ 0.09).
A multicenter randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial
to evaluate the effects of LT4 treatment for pregnant women
with subclinical hypothyroidism or hypothyroxinemia is
currently being conducted by the Maternal Fetal Medicine
Unit of the National Institutes of Health. The primary out-
come will be child IQ at 5 years of age. It is anticipated that
results of this study will be available in 2015.
Universal screening for thyroid dysfunction in pregnancy
has been found to be cost-effective in one study (303). How-
ever, this was based on the assumption that treatment of
subclinically hypothyroid pregnant women would increase
offspring IQ. Another cost-effectiveness study by Thung et al.
(304) concluded that screening for SCH in pregnancy would
be cost-effective if future RCTs were to demonstrate that LT4
treatment of pregnant women with SCH decreased the in-
cidence of offspring with an IQ of less than 85.
& RECOMMENDATION 72
There is insufficient evidence to recommend for or
against universal TSH screening at the first trimester visit.
Level I-USPSTF
& RECOMMENDATION 73
Because no studies to date have demonstrated a benefit to
treatment of isolated maternal hypothyroximenia, univer-
sal FT4 screening of pregnant women is not recommended.
Level D-USPSTF
Question 84: Should serum TSH testing be carried
out in a targeted population of pregnant women?
In the absence of strong evidence favoring universal thy-
roid screening in pregnant women, a case-finding approach
targeting thyroid function testing in high-risk groups has
previously been advocated (1). However, this approach has
been questioned. Vaidya et al. (305) obtained thyroid function
tests in 1560 consecutive pregnancies to evaluate the effec-
tiveness of a targeted case-finding strategy vs. universal
screening to identify patients with hypothyroidism. In this
cohort, 30% of hypothyroid women would not have been
identified using the case-finding approach. In a separate
study of 400 pregnant women, the authors estimated that 55%
of women with thyroid abnormalities (including thyroid an-
tibody positivity and hypothyroxinemia as well as hypothy-
roidism) would have been missed using a case-finding rather
than a universal screening approach (306). To date, universal
screening has not been demonstrated to result in improved
population outcomes (40).
Women who are at high risk for thyroid dysfunction and
may benefit from selected screening during pregnancy
include those with the following attributes:
1) Women with a history of thyroid dysfunction and/or
thyroid surgery. The prevalence of hypothyroidism
following thyroid lobectomy has been reported as
high as 33% (307).
2) Women with a family history of thyroid disease.
3) Women with a goiter.
4) Women with thyroid antibodies. Based on NHANES
data, the odds ratio for OH is approximately 40 in
individuals with TPOAb compared with women who
are TPOAb� (308).
5) Women with symptoms or clinical signs suggestive of
hypothyroidism. It is important to note that women
with OH are not invariably symptomatic. In a case–
control study, although OH patients were more likely
than euthyroid controls to report hypothyroid symp-
toms, only 30% of patients were symptomatic and 17%
of the controls complained of hypothyroid symptoms
(309).
6) Women with type I diabetes, in whom the rate of
development of new onset hypothyroidism in preg-
nancy was 16% in one series (310).
7) Women with a history of either miscarriage or preterm
delivery.
8) Women with other autoimmune disorders that are
frequently associated with autoimmune thyroid dys-
function, including vitiligo, adrenal insufficiency, hypo-
parathyroidism, atrophic gastritis, pernicious anemia,
systemic sclerosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and
Sjo
¨gren’s syndrome (311).
9) Women with infertility should have screening with
TSH as part of their infertility work-up. In one study
2% of women presenting for infertility treatment were
found to have hyperthyroidism (312). The prevalence
of hypothyroidism (overt and subclinical) among
infertile women ranged from 1% to 43% in different
studies (69).
10) Women with prior therapeutic head or neck irradia-
tion. The 8-year prevalence of hypothyroidism has
been calculated to be up to 67% following external
radiation to the head and neck (313).
11) Women with morbid obesity. A body mass index �40
kg/m2 has been associated with an increased prevalence
of hypothyroidism: in two recent studies cohorts of
morbidly obese women had an overall prevalence of SCH
and OH of 13.7% (314) and 19.5% (315), respectively.
12) Women age 30 or older. The prevalence of hypothy-
roidism increases with age. The prevalence of an ele-
vated serum TSH (>5 mIU/L) increases from about
4% in women age 18–24 years to almost 7% in women
aged 35–44 years (308,316).
PREGNANCY AND POSTPARTUM THYROID MANAGEMENT GUIDELINES
1109
 13) Women treated with amiodarone. The prevalence of
thyroid dysfunction in individuals taking amiodarone
varies depending whether regions are iodine deficient
of sufficient, but overall 14%–18% of patients taking
amiodarone will develop overt hyperthyroidism or
overt hypothyroidism (317).
14) Women treated with lithium. Recent estimates of the
prevalence of hypothyroidism in patients using lith-
ium have been variable, ranging between 6% and 52%
(318).
15) Women with a recent (in the past 6 weeks) exposure to
iodinated radiological contrast agents. The prevalence
of iodine-induced thyroid dysfunction may be as high
as 20%, depending on the dietary iodine status of the
exposed individuals (319).
It might be reasonable to consider preconception TSH testing
in high-risk women who desire pregnancy since early diag-
nosis could potentially improve outcomes. However, studies
on this particular issue have not been done.
Finally, women with a previous personal history of thyroid
dysfunction should always be identified at their initial ante-
natal visit so that their thyroid function can be appropriately
monitored and treated.

TSH testing preconception in women at high risk for hy-
pothyroidism. Level I-USPSTF

Serum TSH values should be obtained early in pregnancy
in the following women at high risk for overt hypo-
thyroidism:
History of thyroid dysfunction or prior thyroid surgery
Age >30 years
Symptoms of thyroid dysfunction or the presence of goiter
TPOAb positivity
Type 1 diabetes or other autoimmune disorders
History of miscarriage or preterm delivery
History of head or neck radiation
Family history of thyroid dysfunction

Dissent from one committee member: There is no good evidence
that improved maternal or perinatal outcomes will be obtained if
the criteria for thyroid function screening were different for a
pregnant than a nonpregnant population. Correspondingly,
criteria for screening pregnant women should not differ from the
nonpregnant population.
Figure 3 is an algorithm for the interpretation and man-
agement of the results of first trimester screening.
FUTURE RESEARCH DIRECTIONS
In developing the Guidelines the task force frequently
struggled with the paucity of high-quality double-blind pla-
cebo controlled trials in the field of thyroid and pregnancy. In
fact, only 18 of the 76 recommendations (24%) in the present
Guidelines were graded at the highest USPSTF Level (Level
A). The Guidelines task force identified topics for future re-
search that will be critical in resolving many of the un-
answered questions in the field of thyroid and pregnancy. Of
concern to the task force is that the double-blind placebo
control studies either recently completed, or presently un-
derway, began screening and intervention after the first tri-
mester. As such these studies will not be able to address the
impact of LT4 treatment in the first trimester in women with
SCH, isolated hypothyroxinemia, or thyroid antibody posi-
tivity on the mother and developing fetus. A trial that screens
women preconception and then randomizes women with
SCH or isolated hypothroxinemia and TAbþ euthyroid
women to either a treatment or no treatment arm is needed.
The task force is aware of the difficulties inherent in per-
forming such a trial, and the ethical challenges to be faced.
Nevertheless, we believe that such a trial is feasible, can be
ethically performed with appropriate study design and safe-
guards, and will yield invaluable information related to the
optimal care of the pregnant women and the developing fetus.
Other areas for future research include:
� A comprehensive cost-effectiveness study of screening
for thyroid disease in pregnancy.
� A study evaluating the impact of iodine supplementa-
tion in pregnant women with the mildest form of iodine
deficiency (median urinary iodine concentrations 100–
150 mg/L)
� A study focused on the effects of iodine supplementa-
tion during lactation on infant thyroid function and
cognition.
� A study to determine safe upper limits for iodine in-
gestion in pregnancy and lactation.
� A comprehensive study to asses the iodine status of
pregnant and lactating women in the United States.
� A trial assessing the optimal targeted FT4 level in
pregnant women treated for hyperthyroidism.
� Another well powered, prospective, randomized inter-
ventional trial of LT4 in euthyroid patients who are
TPOAbþ for the prevention of spontaneous abortion
and preterm delivery
� A study to evaluate the impact of LT4 therapy in TAbþ
euthyroid women with recurrent spontaneous abortion.

APPENDIX: PREGNANCY AND POSTPARTUM THYROID DISEASE MANAGEMENT GUIDELINES
OF THE AMERICAN THYROID ASSOCIATION—SUMMARY OF RECOMMENDATIONS
Thyroid Function Tests in Pregnancy
Recommendation 1
Trimester-specific reference ranges for TSH, as defined in populations with optimal iodine
intake, should be applied. Level B-USPSTF
Recommendation 2
If trimester-specific reference ranges for TSH are not available in the laboratory, the
following reference ranges are recommended: first trimester, 0.1–2.5 mIU/L; second
trimester, 0.2–3.0 mIU/L; third trimester, 0.3–3.0 mIU/L. Level I-USPSTF
Recommendation 3
The optimal method to assess serum FT4 during pregnancy is measurement of T4 in the
dialysate or ultrafiltrate of serum samples employing on-line extraction/liquid chroma-
tography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS). Level A-USPSTF
Recommendation 4
If FT4 measurement by LC/MS/MS is not available, clinicians should use whichever
measure or estimate of FT4 is available in their laboratory, being aware of the limitations of
each method. Serum TSH is a more accurate indication of thyroid status in pregnancy than
any of these alternative methods. Level A-USPSTF
Recommendation 5
In view of the wide variation in the results of FT4 assays, method-specific and trimester-
specific reference ranges of serum FT4 are required. Level B-USPSTF
Hypothyroidism in Pregnancy
Recommendation 6
OH should be treated in pregnancy. This includes women with a TSH concentration above
the trimester-specific reference interval with a decreased FT4, and all women with a TSH
concentration above 10.0 mIU/L irrespective of the level of FT4. Level A-USPSTF
Recommendation 7
Isolated hypothyroxinemia should not be treated in pregnancy. Level C-USPSTF
Recommendation 8
SCH has been associated with adverse maternal and fetal outcomes. However, due to the
lack of randomized controlled trials there is insufficient evidence to recommend for or
against universal LT4 treatment in TAb� pregnant women with SCH. Level I-USPSTF
PREGNANCY AND POSTPARTUM THYROID MANAGEMENT GUIDELINES
1121
 Recommendation 9
Women who are positive for TPOAb and have SCH should be treated with LT4.
Level B-USPSTF*
Recommendation 10
The recommended treatment of maternal hypothyroidism is with administration of oral LT4.
It is strongly recommended not to use other thyroid preparations such as T3 or desiccated
thyroid. Level A-USPSTF
Recommendation 11
The goal of LT4 treatment is to normalize maternal serum TSH values within the trimester-
specific pregnancy reference range (first trimester, 0.1–2.5 mIU/L, second trimester, 0.2–3.0
mIU/L, third trimester, 0.3–3.0 mIU/L). Level A-USPSTF
Recommendation 12
Women with SCH in pregnancy who are not initially treated should be monitored for
progression to OH with a serum TSH and FT4 approximately every 4 weeks until 16—20
weeks gestation and at least once between 26 and 32 weeks gestation. This approach has
not been prospectively studied. Level I-USPSTF
Recommendation 13
Treated hypothyroid patients (receiving LT4), who are newly pregnant should independently
increase their dose of LT4 by *25%–30% upon a missed menstrual cycle or positive home
pregnancy test and notify their caregiver promptly. One means of accomplishing this
adjustment is to increase LT4 from once daily dosing to a total of nine doses per week (29%
increase). Level B-USPSTF
Recommendation 14
There exists great interindividual variability regarding the increased amount of T4 (or LT4)
necessary to maintain a normal TSH throughout pregnancy, with some women
requiring only 10%–20% increased dosing, while others may require as much as an 80%
increase. The etiology of maternal hypothyroidism, as well as the preconception level of
TSH, may provide insight into the magnitude of necessary LT4 increase. Clinicians
should seek this information upon assessment of the patient after pregnancy is confirmed.
Level A-USPSTF
Recommendation 15
Treated hypothyroid patients (receiving LT4) who are planning pregnancy should have their
dose adjusted by their provider in order to optimize serum TSH values to <2.5 mIU/L
preconception. Lower preconception TSH values (within the nonpregnant reference range)
reduce the risk of TSH elevation during the first trimester. Level B-USPSTF
Recommendation 16
In pregnant patients with treated hypothyroidism, maternal serum TSH should be
monitored approximately every 4 weeks during the first half of pregnancy because
further LT4 dose adjustments are often required. Level B-USPSTF
Recommendation 17
In pregnant patients with treated hypothyroidism, maternal TSH should be checked at least
once between 26 and 32 weeks gestation. Level I-USPSTF
Recommendation 18
Following delivery, LT4 should be reduced to the patient’s preconception dose. Additional
TSH testing should be performed at approximately 6 weeks postpartum. Level B-USPSTF
Recommendation 19
In the care of women with adequately treated Hashimoto’s thyroiditis, no other maternal or
fetal thyroid testing is recommended beyond measurement of maternal thyroid function
(such as serial fetal ultrasounds, antenatal testing, and/or umbilical blood sampling)
unless for other pregnancy circumstances. Level A-USPSTF
Recommendation 20
Euthyroid women (not receiving LT4) who are TAbþ require monitoring for hypothyroidism
during pregnancy. Serum TSH should be evaluated every 4 weeks during the first half of
pregnancy and at least once between 26 and 32 weeks gestation. Level B-USPSTF
Recommendation 21
A single RCT has demonstrated a reduction in postpartum thyroiditis from selenium
therapy. No subsequent trials have confirmed or refuted these findings. At present,
selenium supplementation is not recommended for TPOAbþ women during pregnancy.
Level C-USPSTF
Thyrotoxicosis in Pregnancy
Recommendation 22
In the presence of a suppressed serum TSH in the first trimester (TSH <0.1 mIU/L), a history
and physical examination are indicated. FT4 measurements should be obtained in all
patients. Measurement of TT3 and TRAb may be helpful in establishing a diagnosis of
hyperthyroidism. Level B-USPSTF
Recommendation 23
There is not enough evidence to recommend for or against the use of thyroid ultrasound in
differentiating the cause of hyperthyroidism in pregnancy. Level I-USPSTF
Recommendation 24
Radioactive iodine (RAI) scanning or radioiodine uptake determination should not be
performed in pregnancy. Level D-USPSTF
Recommendation 25
The appropriate management of women with gestational hyperthyroidism and hyperemesis
gravidarum includes supportive therapy, management of dehydration, and hospitaliza-
tion if needed. Level A-USPSTF
Recommendation 26
ATDs
are
not
recommended
for
the
management
of
gestational
hyperthyroidism.
Level D-USPSTF
Recommendation 27
Thyrotoxic
women
should
be
rendered
euthyroid
before
attempting
pregnancy.
Level A-USPSTF
*Dissent from one committee member: There is no consistent prospective evidence demonstrating that women who are TPOAbþ, but who
have SCH only, achieve maternal or perinatal benefit from LT4 treatment. Correspondingly, there is no indication to treat women who are
TPOAbþ and have SCH with LT4.
1122
STAGNARO-GREEN ET AL.
 Recommendation 28
PTU is preferred for the treatment of hyperthyroidism in the first trimester. Patients on MMI
should be switched to PTU if pregnancy is confirmed in the first trimester. Following the
first trimester, consideration should be given to switching to MMI. Level I-USPSTF
Recommendation 29
A combination regimen of LT4 and an ATD should not be used in pregnancy, except in the
rare situation of fetal hyperthyroidism. Level D-USPSTF
Recommendation 30
In women being treated with ATDs in pregnancy, FT4 and TSH should be monitored
approximately every 2–6 weeks. The primary goal is a serum FT4 at or moderately above
the normal reference range. Level B-USPSTF
Recommendation 31
Thyroidectomy in pregnancy is rarely indicated. If required, the optimal time for
thyroidectomy is in the second trimester. Level A-USPSTF
Recommendation 32
If the patient has a past or present history of Graves’ disease, a maternal serum
determination of TRAb should be obtained at 20–24 weeks gestation. Level B-USPSTF
Recommendation 33
Fetal surveillance with serial ultrasounds should be performed in women who have
uncontrolled hyperthyroidism and/or women with high TRAb levels (greater than three
times the upper limit of normal). A consultation with an experienced obstetrician or
maternal–fetal medicine specialist is optimal. Such monitoring may include ultrasound for
heart rate, growth, amniotic fluid volume and fetal goiter. Level I-USPSTF
Recommendation 34
Cordocentesis should be used in extremely rare circumstances and performed in an
appropriate setting. It may occasionally be of use when fetal goiter is detected in
women taking ATDs to help determine whether the fetus is hyperthyroid or hypothyroid.
Level I-USPSTF
Recommendation 35
MMI in doses up to 20–30 mg/d is safe for lactating mothers and their infants. PTU at doses
up to 300 mg/d is a second-line agent due to concerns about severe hepatotoxicity. ATDs
should be administered following a feeding and in divided doses. Level A-USPSTF
Clinical Guidelines for Iodine Nutrition
Recommendation 36
All pregnant and lactating women should ingest a minimum of 250 mg iodine daily.
Level A-USPSTF
Recommendation 37
To achieve a total of 250 mg of iodine ingestion daily in North America all women who are
planning to be pregnant or are pregnant or breastfeeding should supplement their diet with
a daily oral supplement that contains 150 mg of iodine. This is optimally delivered in the form
of potassium iodide because kelp and other forms of seaweed do not provide a consistent
delivery of daily iodide. Level B-USPSTF
Recommendation 38
In areas of the world outside of North America, strategies for ensuring adequate iodine
intake during preconception, pregnancy, and lactation should vary according to regional
dietary patterns and availability of iodized salt. Level A-USPSTF
Recommendation 39
Pharmacologic doses of iodine exposure during pregnancy should be avoided, except in
preparation for thyroid surgery for Graves’ disease. Clinicians should carefully weigh the
risks and benefits when ordering medications or diagnostic tests that will result in high
iodine exposure. Level C-USPSTF
Recommendation 40
Sustained iodine intake from diet and dietary supplements exceeding 500–1100 mg
daily should be avoided due to concerns about the potential for fetal hypothyroidism.
Level C-USPSTF
Spontaneous Pregnancy Loss, Preterm Delivery, and Thyroid Antibodies
Recommendation 41
There is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against screening all women for anti-
thyroid antibodies in the first trimester of pregnancy. Level I-USPSTF
Recommendation 42
There is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against screening for thyroid antibodies,
or treating in the first trimester of pregnancy with LT4 or IVIG, in euthyroid women with
sporadic or recurrent abortion, or in women undergoing in vitro fertilization (IVF).
Level I-USPSTF
Recommendation 43
There is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against LT4 therapy in TAbþ euthyroid
women during pregnancy. Level I-USPSTF
Recommendation 44
There is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against LT4 therapy in euthyroid TAbþ
women undergoing assisted reproduction technologies. Level I-USPSTF
Recommendation 45
There is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against screening for anti-thyroid
antibodies in the first trimester of pregnancy, or treating TAbþ euthyroid women with
LT4, to prevent preterm delivery. Level I-USPSTF
Thyroid Nodules and Thyroid Cancer
Recommendation 46
The optimal diagnostic strategy for thyroid nodules detected during pregnancy is based on
risk stratification. All women should have the following: a complete history and clinical
examination, serum TSH testing, and ultrasound of the neck. Level A-USPSTF
Recommendation 47
The utility of measuring calcitonin in pregnant women with thyroid nodules is unknown.
Level I-USPSTF
Recommendation 48
Thyroid or lymph node FNA confers no additional risks to a pregnancy. Level A-USPSTF
Recommendation 49
Thyroid nodules discovered during pregnancy that have suspicious ultrasound features, as
delineated by the 2009 ATA guidelines, should be considered for FNA. In instances in
which nodules are likely benign, FNA may be deferred until after delivery based on
patients’ preference. Level I-USPSTF
PREGNANCY AND POSTPARTUM THYROID MANAGEMENT GUIDELINES
1123
 Recommendation 50
The use of radioiodine imaging and/or uptake determination or therapeutic dosing is
contraindicated during pregnancy. Inadvertent use of radioiodine prior to 12 weeks of
gestation does not appear to damage the fetal thyroid. Level A-USPSTF
Recommendation 51
Because the prognosis of women with well-differentiated thyroid cancer identified but not
treated during pregnancy is similar to that of nonpregnant patients, surgery may be
generally deferred until postpartum. Level B-USPSTF
Recommendation 52
The impact of pregnancy on women with medullary carcinoma is unknown. Surgery is
recommended during pregnancy in the presence of a large primary tumor or extensive
lymph node metastases. Level I-USPSTF
Recommendation 53
Surgery for thyroid carcinoma during the second trimester of pregnancy has not been
demonstrated to be associated with increased maternal or fetal risk. Level B-USPSTF
Recommendation 54
Pregnant women with thyroid nodules that are read as benign on FNA cytology do not
require surgery during pregnancy except in cases of rapid nodule growth and/or if severe
compressive symptoms develop. Postpartum, nodules should be managed according to
the 2009 ATA guidelines. Level B-USPSTF
Recommendation 55
When a decision has been made to defer surgery for well-differentiated thyroid carcinoma
until after delivery, neck ultrasounds should be performed during each trimester to assess
for rapid tumor growth, which may indicate the need for surgery. Level I-USPSTF
Recommendation 56
Surgery in women with well-differentiated thyroid carcinoma may be deferred until
postpartum without adversely affecting the patient’s prognosis. However, if substantial
growth of the well-differentiated thyroid carcinoma occurs or the emergence of lymph
node
metastases
prior
to
midgestation
occurs,
then
surgery
is
recommended.
Level B-USPSTF
Recommendation 57
Thyroid hormone therapy may be considered in pregnant women who have deferred
surgery for well-differentiated thyroid carcinoma until postpartum. The goal of LT4
therapy is a serum TSH level of 0.1–1.5 mIU/L. Level I-USPSTF
Recommendation 58
Pregnant patients with an FNA sample that is suspicious for thyroid cancer do not require
surgery while pregnant except in cases of rapid nodular growth and/or the appearance of
lymph node metastases. Thyroid hormone therapy is not recommended. Level I-USPSTF
Recommendation 59
The preconception TSH goal in women with DTC, which is determined by risk stratification,
should be maintained during pregnancy. TSH should be monitored approximately every 4
weeks until 16–20 weeks of gestation and once between 26 and 32 weeks of gestation.
Level B-USPSTF
Recommendation 60
There is no evidence that previous exposure to radioiodine affects the outcomes of
subsequent pregnancies and offspring. Pregnancy should be deferred for 6 months
following RAI treatment. LT4 dosing should be stabilized following RAI treatment before
pregnancy is attempted. Level B-USPSTF
Recommendation 61
Ultrasound and Tg monitoring during pregnancy in patients with a history of previously
treated DTC is not required for low-risk patients with no Tg or structural evidence of
disease prior to pregnancy. Level B-USPSTF
Recommendation 62
Ultrasound monitoring should be performed each trimester during pregnancy in patients
with previously treated DTC and who have high levels of Tg or evidence of persistent
structural disease prior to pregnancy. Level B-USPSTF
Postpartum Thyroiditis
Recommendation 63
Women with postpartum depression should have TSH, FT4, and TPOAb tests performed.
Level B-USPSTF
Recommendation 64
During the thyrotoxic phase of PPT, symptomatic women may be treated with beta blockers.
Propranolol at the lowest possible dose to alleviate symptoms is the treatment of choice.
Therapy is typically required for a few months. Level B-USPSTF
Recommendation 65
ATDs
are
not
recommended
for
the
treatment
of
the
thyrotoxic
phase
of
PPT.
Level D-USPSTF
Recommendation 66
Following the resolution of the thyrotoxic phase of PPT, TSH should be tested every 2
months (or if symptoms are present) until 1 year postpartum to screen for the hypothyroid
phase. Level B-USPSTF
Recommendation 67
Women who are symptomatic with hypothyroidism in PPT should either have their
TSH level retested in 4–8 weeks or be started on LT4 (if symptoms are severe, if conception
is being attempted, or if the patient desires therapy). Women who are asymptomatic
with hypothyroidism in PPT should have their TSH level retested in 4–8 weeks.
Level B-USPSTF
Recommendation 68
Women who are hypothyroid with PPT and attempting pregnancy should be treated with
LT4. Level A-USPSTF
Recommendation 69
If LT4 is initiated for PPT, future discontinuation of therapy should be attempted. Tapering of
treatment can be begun 6–12 months after the initiation of treatment. Tapering of LT4
should be avoided when a woman is actively attempting pregnancy, is breastfeeding, or is
pregnant. Level C-USPSTF
1124
STAGNARO-GREEN ET AL.
 Recommendation 70
Women with a prior history of PPT should have an annual TSH test performed to evaluate
for permanent hypothyroidism. Level A-USPSTF
Recommendation 71
Treatment of TAbþ euthyroid pregnant woman with either LT4 or iodine to prevent PPT is
ineffective and is not recommended. Level D-USPSTF
Thyroid Function Screening in Pregnancy
Recommendation 72
There is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against universal TSH screening at the
first trimester visit. Level I-USPSTF
Recommendation 73
Because no studies to date have demonstrated a benefit to treatment of isolated maternal
hypothyroximenia, universal FT4 screening of pregnant women is not recommended.
Level D-USPSTF
Recommendation 74
There is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against TSH testing preconception in
women at high risk for hypothyroidism. Level I-USPSTF
Recommendation 75
All pregnant women should be verbally screened at the initial prenatal visit for any history of
thyroid dysfunction and/or use of thyroid hormone (LT4) or anti-thyroid medications
(MMI, carbimazole, or PTU). Level B-USPSTF
Recommendation 76
Serum TSH values should be obtained early in pregnancy in the following women at high
risk for overt hypothyroidism:
History of thyroid dysfunction or prior thyroid surgery
Age >30 years
Symptoms of thyroid dysfunction or the presence of goiter
TPOAb positivity
Type 1 diabetes or other autoimmune disorders
History of miscarriage or preterm delivery
History of head or neck radiation
Family history of thyroid dysfunction
Morbid obesity (BMI �40 kg/m2)
Use of amiodarone or lithium, or recent administration of iodinated radiologic contrast
Infertility
Residing in an area of known moderate to severe iodine sufficiency
Level B-USPSTF{
{Dissent from one committee member: There is no good evidence that improved maternal or perinatal outcomes will be obtained if the
criteria for thyroid function screening were different for a pregnant than a nonpregnant population. Correspondingly, criteria for screening
pregnant women should not differ from the nonpregnant population.
This article has been revised since its original e-publication on July 25, 2011, in order to merge duplicate terminology and correct
typographical errors. The terms ‘‘anti-thyroid antibodies,’’ ‘‘anti-TPO antibodies,’’ and ‘‘Abþ’’ have been replaced by ‘‘thyroid antibodies,’’
