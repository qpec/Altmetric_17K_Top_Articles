Summary
Postoperative pulmonary complications are a major determinant of outcome for patients and consume huge
resources within hospital, particularly in critical care. Prediction and anticipation of postoperative pulmonary com-
plications are vital for patient selection and, in some cases, for informed patient consent. Being able to assess the
likelihood of postoperative pulmonary complications also allows research into methods to reduce them by allowing
allocation of patients to the appropriate arms of research trials. Some patients have pre-operative characteristics or
belong to patient groups such as those with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or obstructive sleep apnoea,
where techniques and evidence-based guidance to avoid or reduce complications are becoming established. Intra-
operative ventilation and the use of lung-protective ventilation may be helpful during major surgery, but studies
looking at reduced tidal volumes, recruitment and levels of positive end-expiratory pressure, have this far only led
to a degree of consensus in terms of tidal volume, although parameters that predispose to postoperative pulmonary
complications are becoming clearer. Optimal postoperative care in terms of analgesia, positioning, physiotherapy
and mobilisation is another developing area. Techniques such as continuous positive airways pressure, non-invasive
ventilation and high-flow nasal humidified oxygen appear to show some benefit, but the exact roles, pressures and
timings of each are currently being explored. Much remains to be researched and developed into evidence-based
practice.

Introduction
Postoperative pulmonary complications (PPC) are the
most common medium term complications after major
surgery [1] and have a major impact on patient well-
being and outcome [2–4]. Severe PPCs occurred in
2.8% of all patients and 14.5% of patients who were
defined as being at increased risk during the LAS
VEGAS
study
of
non-obstetric
and
non-cardiac
surgery [5]. Pulmonary complications account for 10–
40% of postoperative complications after abdominal
and vascular surgery [6]. A rise in the number of PPCs
is associated with worsening outcomes and prolonged
hospital stay [7]. Increasing severity of PPCs is associ-
ated with a worsened chance of survival. [7, 8] Postop-
erative respiratory failure within 30 days after surgery
requiring mechanical ventilation is associated with

 increased mortality. Pulmonary complications better
predict long-term mortality after non-cardiac surgery
than cardiac complications.
Studies have been undertaken to predict the likeli-
hood of respiratory complications after surgery [9].
This is important for pre-operative patient selection
and preparation, patient informed consent, and intra-
and postoperative critical care planning. The resulting
risk indices have also allowed cohorts of patients to be
compared in peri-operative studies and have enabled
us to understand which parameters are the most
important to record. Arozullah and colleagues identi-
fied seven surgically related and pre-existing factors,
including functional dependence, that were associated
with postoperative respiratory deterioration [10,11].
These included: type of surgery (abdominal aortic
aneurysm, thoracic, neurosurgery, upper abdominal
and peripheral vascular, emergency surgery); albumin
< 30 g.l�1; urea > 11 mmol.l�1; partial or full depen-
dency; chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD);
and age.
Gupta et al. developed a risk calculator predicting
postoperative respiratory failure requiring mechanical
ventilation, based on data from the American College
of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement
Program (NSQIP) [6]. The resulting model included
five predictors of postoperative respiratory failure: type
of surgery; emergency status; dependent functional sta-
tus; pre-operative sepsis; and ASA physical status.
Postoperative respiratory failure was associated with
much higher 30-day mortality (25.62% vs. 0.98%).
More recently, Canet et al. developed, and then vali-
dated, the Assess Respiratory Risk In Surgical patients
in Catalonia (ARISCAT) system for predicting PPCs,
with seven independent risk factors: age; pre-operative
oxygenation saturation; respiratory infection in the last
month; pre-operative anaemia (haemoglobin concen-
tration < 100 g.l�1); upper abdominal or thoracic sur-
gery; surgical duration > 2 h; and whether the surgery
was an emergency procedure [8,12]. Moderate risk was
indicated by an ARISCAT score of 26 and high risk by
a score > 45.
How we define complications varies with different
research, and some studies have simultaneously exam-
ined extrapulmonary complications. This can be an
issue
when
comparing
studies.
For
example,
PROVHILO, which is an interventional study of differ-
ent levels of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP)
during major surgery (https://sites.google.com/site/prov
hilo/), employed a collapsed composite including: mild
respiratory failure (defined by PaO2 or peripheral cap-
illary oxygen saturation (SpO2) in air); severe respira-
tory failure (defined by PaO2 or SpO2 with oxygen or
non-invasive or invasive mechanical ventilation; acute
lung injury (ALI)/acute respiratory distress syndrome
(ARDS); defined pulmonary infection (by sputum,
antibiotics, chest radiograph or white cell count); pleu-
ral effusion; radiological signs of atelectasis; pneumoth-
orax; bronchospasm or aspiration pneumonia with
respiratory
failure;
and
cardiopulmonary
oedema.
Gupta et al. [6], when trying to predict outcome, took
a different primary endpoint, looking at postopera-
tive respiratory failure (if a patient’s trachea was
re-intubated postoperatively within 30 days unless part
of anaesthesia for subsequent surgery) or required
mechanical ventilation for more than 48 h postopera-
tively. This complicates how we interpret the results of
studies and how we use the resulting data.
Anaesthesia and its effects on the
lungs
Intra-operative ventilation is required during anaes-
thesia in 234 million patients per year [13]. Efforts to
reduce the impact of ventilation on the lungs are,
therefore, potentially very important. As a result,
many
anaesthetists
have
adopted
the
ventilatory
strategies used in ICU. However, the question is
whether
this
makes
an
important
difference
in
patients undergoing surgery without ARDS, which
necessitates ventilation of hours in duration rather
than days. Ventilatory modes available include com-
bined assist/controlled modes, when neuromuscular
blockade is not required, or much more commonly,
volume- or pressure-controlled ventilation, both of
which have some advantages when considering lung
protection. Barotrauma may be easier to avoid with
pressure-controlled ventilation and volutrauma more
easily
avoided
with
volume-controlled
ventilation,
because set volumes are more assured. Modern sys-
tems, especially on intensive care, are now available
that
combine
both
pressure
and
volume
control,
which make adjustments easier to maintain.

 Atelectrauma occurs when lung units are repeat-
edly opened and closed and is promoted when there is
a lack of surfactant. Atelectasis is made more likely by
obesity or by other external pressures such as raised
intra-abdominal pressure or pleural effusions. Low
PEEP may contribute to atelectrauma, with repeated
opening and closing of small airways. However, the
effect of PEEP is going to be different in different parts
of the lungs, depending on the compressing forces act-
ing locally, so some areas may be overexpanded and
some not expanded at all. Anaesthesia is associated
with increased atelectasis [14, 15] especially in patients
receiving high inspired oxygen concentrations [16],
obese patients and following intra-abdominal surgery
[17, 18]. In patients with damaged lungs, the driving
pressure
in
positive-pressure
ventilation
may
be
applied to a relatively small number of alveoli, causing
overdistension [19]. Pre-oxygenation with a high frac-
tion of inspired oxygen (FIO2) is important to allow a
safe period for tracheal intubation. However, once the
patient’s trachea has been safely intubated, the FIO2
can be reduced to minimise oxygen atelectasis [20, 21]
(usually to 0.3 and adjusted according to oxygen satu-
ration measurements). Above a FIO2 of 0.8 or 0.9 the
rate of absorption collapse, especially in the presence
of some airway closure, is greatly accelerated. Benoit
et al. found that the use of a FIO2 of 0.4 plus vital
capacity recruitment at tracheal extubation resulted in
less atelectasis compared with the use of a FIO2 of 1.0
or FIO2 of 1.0 plus recruitment [22]. Evidence suggests
that a high FIO2 is also associated with worse out-
comes in COPD. This may be related to atelectasis
and also to oxidative stress and airway inflammation,
as well as complex effects involving the production of
hypercarbia.
The World Health Organization and the United
States Centre for Disease Control [23] have recom-
mended the use of a FIO2 of 0.8 to reduce wound
infection
and
postoperative
nausea
and
vomiting.
However, studies have shown that this is at the
expense of an increased risk of respiratory complica-
tions [24, 25]. Importantly a high FIO2 is not the only
determinant of wound perfusion, which can be com-
promised by surgical trauma, hypovolaemia, oedema,
hypothermia, decreased cardiac output and severe
pain.
Therefore,
global
hemodynamic
optimisation
may be more important from the wound healing and
infection perspective and so further exploration may
be needed in this area. Furthermore, the balance of
beneficial and adverse effects appears to be influenced
by age, particularly in the very young and the older
patient [26–28]. Ageing increases sensitivity to oxida-
tive stress and hyperoxia decreases cerebral blood flow
[29], elevating the risk of stroke or postoperative cog-
nitive deficit, and worsening outcome in stroke once it
has occurred. Hyperoxia may also cause vasoconstric-
tion in systemic arteries, so increasing systemic vascu-
lar
resistance
and
potentially
impairing
coronary
perfusion [30].
Protective ventilation employing reduced tidal vol-
umes has been found to reduce mortality in intensive
care patients with ARDS [31, 32]. Critically ill patients
without ARDS may also benefit from low tidal volume
ventilation [33, 34]. Driving pressure is a concept that
can be viewed as the ratio of tidal volume/compliance
or of tidal volume to plateau pressure minus PEEP.
Consideration of driving pressure may represent a way
of adjusting the size of the tidal volume to the amount
of lung that can reasonably be expected to expand,
hence reducing overinflation of individual lung units.
For example, if only half of the alveoli in the lung are
available for expansion then for those lung units what
appears to be an expansion of 6 ml.kg�1 will be equiv-
alent to 12 ml.kg�1. Amato et al. analysed over 3500
patients with ARDS recruited to previous studies and
concluded that driving pressure was a better predictor
of mortality than compliance or tidal volume, and that
patients with rising driving pressure had increasing
mortality [35]. Driving pressure is also associated with
PPCs in patients undergoing mechanical ventilation
during surgery [19]. Some ventilators allow the mea-
surement of transpulmonary pressure, which is the
difference between airway pressure and oesophageal
pressure measured from a balloon catheter [36]. This
is equivalent to the pressure difference from the air-
way to the pleura [37]. It is this pressure that is dis-
tending the lung during mechanical ventilation. This
may help in the setting of PEEP; that is, enough to
keep airways open and to keep transpulmonary pres-
sure positive at end-expiration. Pre-operative interven-
tions in patients at risk, such as the optimisation of
COPD may be of benefit. Other interventions such as

 inspiratory muscle training remain at an early stage of
development.
Are lung-protective techniques relevant
to patients without ARDS or who are
undergoing surgical procedures?
Many operating theatre patients will be elective cases
with relatively normal lungs; some, however, will be
emergencies, with high levels of inflammatory stimulus
and who may well be at elevated risk of lung injury.
Prevention or re-expansion of atelectatic areas may,
therefore, be important, as may be the avoidance of
lung stretch or shearing effects. Some studies have sug-
gested that low tidal volumes and PEEP are not used
widely in theatre. Jaber et al. found that PEEP was
used in 20% of cases and tidal volumes larger than
10 ml.kg�1 in 20% of cases [38]. However, in recent
years, more sophisticated ventilators have become
available, allowing the use of intra-operative PEEP,
and there has been an adoption of some of the ventila-
tion techniques used more commonly in the ICU.
However, PEEP alone is not enough to re-inflate
atelectatic lungs. Rothen et al. used computed tomog-
raphy (CT) studies to examine how much inflation
was typically required [39]; this was the equivalent of
a single vital capacity breath. Recruitment techniques
have been developed to open the lung and then
attempt to keep it open by applying suitable levels of
PEEP. After a vital capacity recruitment manoeuvre,
PEEP 10 cm H20 appeared to prevent recurrence of
atelectasis [40]. Therefore, low tidal volume, PEEP and
lung recruitment could have a role in the operating
theatre.
Futier et al. studied 400 adults at intermediate- to
high risk of PPCs after major abdominal surgery dur-
ing
the
Intra-operative
Protective
Ventilation
(IMPROVE) trial [41], looking for a composite pri-
mary outcome of major pulmonary and extrapul-
monary
complications.
The
intervention
involved
intra-operative lung-protective measures, including low
tidal volumes (6–8 ml.kg�1 of predicted body weight),
PEEP
(6–8 cmH2O)
and
recruitment
manoeuvres
(30 cm H2O held for 30 s), vs. no recruitment, no
PEEP and tidal volumes of 10–12 ml.kg�1. This is in
marked contrast to past years, where high tidal vol-
umes (10–15 ml.kg�1) had been recommended during
anaesthesia to reduce atelectasis [42]. However, over
time, evidence has demonstrated a risk of alveolar
overdistension and extrapulmonary damage due to
cytokine release leading to the current interest in lung-
protective ventilation. Futier et al. found a 69% reduc-
tion in the probability of a major pulmonary or extra-
pulmonary event when lung-protective measures were
used [41]. Intra-operative lung-protective ventilation
during abdominal surgery, including low tidal volumes,
PEEP and recruitment manoeuvres have also been
shown to reduce postoperative Clinical Pulmonary
Infection Scores (CPIS) [43]. These randomised clinical
trial results conflict with an observational study which
found increased mortality with low tidal volumes and
low PEEP [44]. However, this may well be explained
by important differences in patient characteristics, and
resulting likelihood of a poor outcome [45].
The LAS VEGAS study observed practice, out-
comes and predictive factors in 9864 patients across 29
countries and 146 hospitals in 2013 [5]. Importantly,
peak pressure was a ventilatory variable associated
with severe PPCs (a separate analysis of plateau or
driving pressure was not performed, because all are
closely associated with each other). Intra-operative low
oxygen saturations, transfusion of red cells, urgent or
emergency surgery, and some pre-operative medical
factors (including a history of obstructive sleep apnoea
(OSA)) were also associated with the development of
PPCs. Laparoscopic surgery was negatively associated
with
PPC
occurrence.
Perhaps
surprisingly,
the
LAS VEGAS study failed to show a relationship
between PEEP level and PPCs.
PROVHILO examined the role of intra-operative
high PEEP (12 cm H2O) plus recruitment manoeuvres
in patients receiving low tidal volume ventilation
(8 ml.kg�1) vs. low tidal volume with no PEEP and no
recruitment. No difference in outcome was found
between the two groups, other than a small increase in
intra-operative cardiovascular instability in the PEEP
group. The conclusion was that this higher level of
PEEP and recruitment did not protect against PPCs
during open abdominal surgery [46].
The role of lung-protective ventilation in laparo-
scopic surgery is less clear. Initial studies have not
shown a difference in inflammatory markers depen-
dent on ventilation technique [47]. The effect of

 different levels of PEEP on PPCs in obese patients is
currently
being
explored
in
the
PROBESE
study
(NCT02148692),

surgery
in
PROTHOR
(NCT02963025) and in robotic surgery with high
levels of head down tilt in AVATaR (NCT02989415).
Relationship with smoking and upper
respiratory tract infections
Upper respiratory tract infections (URTI) increase the
risk of intra-operative or postoperative complications.
Patients who are apyrexial, have normal SpO2, with
clear nasal secretions and no chest signs may have a very
low risk of complications. However, patients who appear
unwell, with purulent nasal secretions, a productive
cough and with chest signs have a high risk of PPCs and
so surgery should be postponed if not urgent. A history
of asthma and, paternal smoking in paediatric patients
[48] and prematurity [49] increase the risk of laryn-
gospasm and bronchospasm [50], oxygen desaturation
below 90% and a greater incidence of PPCs, especially if
the patient’s trachea is intubated [49]. Even after recov-
ery from an URTI, reactive airways may produce respi-
ratory complications during and after anaesthesia.
Surgery should, therefore, be delayed for a further 4–
6 weeks unless required urgently [51, 52].
Postoperative pulmonary complications increase
by a factor of six with a history of 40 pack-years of
smoking [53]. Smoking is responsible for creating, or
worsening, a range of respiratory diseases, as well as
promoting ischaemic heart disease and hypertension.
Smokers have more irritable airways and suffer from a
greater number of unexpected respiratory deteriora-
tions postoperatively. The forced expiratory volume in
1 s (FEV1) reduces three times as fast as in the normal
population and the closing volume falls, thereby pro-
moting small airway collapse. Carbon monoxide binds
with the haemoglobin and may increase to 10%, hence
reducing the amount of haemoglobin that is available
for oxygen carriage. The oxygen-haemoglobin dissocia-
tion curve is shifted left, reducing the ability of haemo-
globin to release oxygen. Chronic hypoxia may lead to
polycythaemia, so worsening flow and tissue perfusion
and there is an increase in fibrinogen concentration
and platelet stickiness.
Unfortunately, the benefits of stopping smoking
do
not
appear
immediately.
Clearance
of
carbon
monoxide may start after 24 h, airways may be less
reactive
after
10 days,
but
sputum
accumulation
increases until the cilia have had time to recover,
which may take around 2 months. Despite this, the
peri-operative period is an important opportunity for
patients to stop smoking, so smoking cessation should
be encouraged.
Chronic respiratory diseases
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease has been iden-
tified as an independent mortality risk factor in
patients with critical illness and is associated with early
tracheal
re-intubation
after
surgery
[54]
and
an
increase in postoperative morbidity and mortality. Pre-
operative interventions may improve patients before
surgery [55]. Anaesthetic technique may also help
improve outcome by avoiding invasive postoperative
ventilation and by using regional techniques. Epidural
anaesthesia as the sole technique may reduce pneumo-
nia by as much as 50% [56]. Case reports of the use of
epidural and spinal anaesthesia for abdominal surgery
have been described. In those patients where tracheal
intubation and ventilation is essential, then early tra-
cheal extubation (onto non-invasive ventilation where
required), avoidance of air trapping/high airway pres-
sures and PEEP in patients with large bullae are
important strategies.
Bronchiectasis results from abnormal widening of
the airways, which makes sputum clearance more diffi-
cult, hence promoting lung infections. Cystic fibrosis
leads to severe bronchiectasis, with potentially severe
consequences for postoperative pulmonary complica-
tions as sputum clearance becomes even worse.
Restrictive lung disorders, including chest wall dis-
eases, are also worthy of consideration. There are a
number of fibrotic lung diseases which make ventila-
tion, recovery of respiratory function after ventilation
and avoidance of PPCs a potential problem [57]. Stiff
lungs make the effects of PEEP and lung recruitment
unpredictable. Knowing the type of lung fibrosis, its
severity and prognosis, is very important when decid-
ing the risk:benefit ratio of surgery; however, this is
often difficult [57]. Access to previous notes and respi-
ratory investigations to characterise the disease and its
likely prognosis are therefore very important in the
pre-operative
period,
especially
in
idiopathic

 pulmonary fibrosis, which is a progressive life-limiting
disease. Chest wall diseases include musculoskeletal
disorders such as ankylosing spondylitis or kyphoscol-
iosis. Both expose the patient to a reduction in lung
function and, in the case of ankylosing spondylitis,
potentially difficult airway access. Importantly, in both
situations, patients may be greatly at risk if an ileus
results in increased intra-abdominal pressure, so com-
promising diaphragm function.
Neuromuscular
disorders
include
myopathies,
poliomyelitis, motor neurone disease and multiple scle-
rosis. These all present risks of respiratory failure,
especially where the disease is established and chronic
weakness is a factor. Some patients may already be on
some form of respiratory support, such as nocturnal
non-invasive ventilation. The established weakness,
with the potential to produce respiratory drive compli-
cations and resulting difficulty to cough is a major
cause of PPCs.
Obesity
results
in
reduced
functional
residual
capacity and atelectasis, while being associated with
OSA in 10–20% of patients with a body mass index
(BMI) > 35 kg.m�2 and asthma. Therefore, where pos-
sible, local or regional anaesthesia is preferable to gen-
eral anaesthesia. Obstructive sleep apnoea results in
temporary occlusion of the upper airway with periods
of apnoea and in some cases, alveolar hypoventilation
that can be exacerbated by anaesthesia and opioid
drugs. Obstructive sleep apnoea is also associated with
an
increased
incidence
of
difficult
laryngoscopy
(> 35% if the neck circumference exceeds 60 cm)[58],
stroke, myocardial infarction and even pulmonary
emboli.
Gupta
et al.
found
a
greater
number
of
unplanned ICU admissions in obese compared with
non-obese patients (20% vs. 6%) [6] and Mutter et al.
found a doubling of ICU admissions [59]. Pre-opera-
tive screening using the STOP-BANG questionnaire
with a threshold score of 5 has shown a high rate of
undiagnosed OSA [60]. In some centres this is rapidly
investigated and treated by the sleep clinic before sur-
gery, but in others, acts solely as a flag to the anaes-
thetist, despite the long-term consequences and the
increased risk of tracheal re-intubation in the postop-
erative period. Oxygen saturations < 95% on air,
forced vital capacity 3 l, FEV1 < 1.5 l, wheeze at rest
or sodium bicarbonate > 27 mmol.l�1 are signs of
increased likelihood of respiratory failure postopera-
tively. If present an arterial blood gas analysis should
be undertaken, looking for a PaCO2 > 6 kPa which, if
present, indicates increased risk. Patients who desatu-
rate after anaesthesia are at increased risk of respira-
tory
failure
[61,
62],
which
can
be
reduced
by
continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) [63].
During emergence from anaesthesia, reversal of
neuromuscular blockade, confirmed by a nerve stimu-
lator, is important. Obese patients who show persistent
signs of desaturation or hypopnoea in the post-anaes-
thetic care unit (PACU), should be referred to critical
care. There is an increased risk of airway obstruction
or hypopnoea if the patient is not fully awake and tra-
cheal extubation should be performed sitting up, which
is mechanically better for the respiratory muscles.
Continuous positive airway pressure should be re-
established in patients who are on home therapy [64]
and the need for non-invasive ventilation considered.
Recovery and therapy in the
postoperative period
General anaesthesia and postoperative analgesia may
impair respiratory drive, cough and immune function.
Residual neuromuscular blockade can be a major prob-
lem and was found to be common in the Canadian
RECITE study (56.5% with train-of-four ratio < 0.9 on
arrival in PACU) [65]. Adequate reversal is important
to reduce postoperative complications.
Adequate analgesia is also vital to allow patients to
deep breathe, cough and mobilise. Chest physiother-
apy, early mobilisation, sitting up positioning, and
deep breathing and coughing exercises may reduce
PPCs [66]. Continuous positive airway pressure or
non-invasive
ventilation
would
appear
as
logical
choices in patients who are at risk of respiratory fail-
ure in the postoperative period, especially non-invasive
ventilation where PaCO2 is elevated. Work is progress-
ing to define the exact roles and effectiveness of these
techniques, although many studies have been inconclu-
sive [67] and may not have adequately looked for
adverse effects [68]. Squadrone et al. found that CPAP
led to lower tracheal re-intubation rates and a reduc-
tion in length of stay [69]. Non-invasive ventilation
reduces the short-term tracheal re-intubation rate after
abdominal surgery [70]. High-flow humidified oxygen

 via nasal cannulae have been shown in a cardiotho-
racic surgery study to be non-inferior to non-invasive
ventilation in reducing tracheal re-intubation rate [71].
Perhaps most importantly, high-flow nasal cannulae
are more comfortable and better tolerated, which may
be important in the confused patient. There is also a
role for high-flow oxygen during potentially difficult
tracheal intubation where an increase in the period of
adequate oxygenation is important.
Conclusion
The anticipation and prediction of PPCs allows better
preparation and decision making for the clinician and
permits informed consent for the patient. The use of
lung-protective ventilation techniques, particularly using
relatively low tidal volumes, appears important in reduc-
ing PPCs. The optimum level of PEEP remains unclear.
In the postoperative period, adequate anticipation and
monitoring seems important. The exact role of CPAP,
non-invasive ventilation and high-flow nasal oxygen is
currently being explored. However, perhaps the most
important factor for the future is a recognition of the
likelihood, consequences and the need to try to prevent
PPCs, which have a lasting consequence for patients.
