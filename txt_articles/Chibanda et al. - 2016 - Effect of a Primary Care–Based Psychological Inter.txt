Key Points  
63 
Question: Does a lay health worker-delivered psychological intervention improve symptoms of 
64 
depression and anxiety in Zimbabwe? 
65 
Findings: In a cluster-randomized clinical trial of 573 randomized patients with common mental 
66 
disorders and symptoms of depression, the group who received the intervention had significantly 
67 
lower symptom scores after 6 months compared to a control group who had enhanced usual care. 
68 
Meaning: The use of lay health workers in resource-poor countries like Zimbabwe may be effective  
69 
primary-care-based management of common mental disorders.  
70 
 
71 
Abstract 
72 
Importance: Depression and anxiety are common mental disorders globally, but rarely recognized or 
73 
treated in low-income settings. Task-shifting of mental health care to lay health workers (LHWs) might 
74 
decrease the treatment gap. 
75 
Objective: To evaluate the effectiveness of a culturally-adapted psychological intervention for common 
76 
mental disorders delivered by LHWs in primary care . 
77 
Design, setting and participants: Cluster-randomized clinical trial with 6 months follow-up conducted from 
78 
1 September 2014-25 May 2015 in Harare, Zimbabwe. Twenty four clinics were randomised 1:1 to the 
79 
intervention or enhanced usual care. Participants were clinic attenders aged >18 years who screened 
80 
positive for common mental disorders on the locally-validated Shona Symptom Questionnaire (SSQ-14).   
81 
Interventions: The Friendship Bench intervention comprised 6 sessions of individual problem-solving 
82 
therapy delivered by trained, supervised LHWs plus an optional 6-session peer support program. The 
83 
control group received standard care plus information, education and support on common mental 
84 
disorders.  
85 
Main outcome measures: Primary outcome was common mental disorder measured at 6 months as a 
86 
continuous variable via the SSQ-14 score, with a range of 0 (best)to 14 (worst) and a cut-point 9. The 
87 
 5 
 
secondary outcome was depression symptoms measured as a binary variable with the Patient Health 
88 
Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9),  with a range of  0 (best) to 27 (worst) and a cut-point 11). Outcomes were 
89 
analyzed by intention-to-treat. 
90 
Results: Among 573 randomized patients (286  in the intervention group  and 287 control group),  495 
91 
(86.4%) were women, median age was 33 years (interquartile range 27-41 years),  238 41.7% were HIV 
92 
positive, and 521 (90.9%) )  completed follow up at 6 months. Intervention group participants had fewer 
93 
symptoms than control group participants on the SSQ-14 (3.81 (95% CI 3.28, 4.34) vs 8.90 (95% CI 8.33, 
94 
9.47), adjusted mean difference (AMD)=-4.86; 95% CI -5.63, -4.10, p<0.001; adjusted risk ratio(ARR)=0.21, 
95 
95% CI 0.15, 0.29, p<0.001). Intervention participants also had lower risk of symptoms of depression 
96 
(13.7% vs 49.9%, ARR=0.28, 95% CI 0.22, 0.34, p<0.001).  
97 
Conclusions and Relevance: Among individuals screening positive for common mental disorders in 
98 
Zimbabwe, LHW-administered, primary care-based problem solving therapy with education and support 
99 
compared with standard care plus education and support resulted in improved symptoms at 6 months. 
100 
Scaled-up integration of this intervention should be evaluated.

Introduction 
109 
Depression and anxiety are the most common mental disorders  globally and major causes of disease 
110 
burden in Sub-Saharan Africa1,2. Few people with common mental disorders in low-income settings have 
111 
access to effective treatments3. When left untreated, common mental disorders can impair role 
112 
functioning, self-care and adherence to treatments, and are associated with reduced productivity and 
113 
increased healthcare costs4. 
114 
Zimbabwe has a large treatment gap for common mental disorders, with only 10 psychiatrists serving a 
115 
population of 13 million. Prevalence of common mental disorders above 25% has been reported among 
116 
adult primary care attendees5-8 but there are no psychological services in primary health care. A potentially 
117 
feasible approach to improve this situation would require task-shifting; allowing properly trained and 
118 
supervised lay health workers (LHWs) in primary care to contribute to the treatment of common mental 
119 
disorders. Mental health interventions delivered by LHWs must be simple and brief so that they can 
120 
effectively provide care for a range of common mental health problems9. Problem solving therapy is a brief 
121 
psychological therapy which has been shown to be effective for many common mental health conditions 
122 
seen in primary care in high-income settings10,11. A problem-solving therapy intervention locally termed 
123 
‘The Friendship Bench’  has been shown in piloting to be acceptable for LHWs to deliver in Zimbabwe with 
124 
promising results7,12,13.  In the Friendship Bench model, trained and supervised LHWs provided 6 sessions of 
125 
individual problem-solving therapy to all patients with common mental disorders and referred those not 
126 
improving or with suicidal ideation to their immediate supervisors for treatment adjustments14. 
127 
Participants were also invited to an optional 6-session peer-led group support program. The aim of this 
128 
trial was to evaluate the effectiveness of this culturally adapted intervention for common mental disorders 
129 
delivered by existing LHWs in primary care in Harare, Zimbabwe. 
130 
 
131 
Methods 
132 
 7 
 
Trial Design: The study protocol has been published previously14 and is available in the Supplement. We 
133 
conducted a cluster-randomized clinical trial in 24 primary care clinics (clusters) in Harare, Zimbabwe, with 
134 
a 1:1 allocation ratio. A cluster design was used because the intervention involved training staff at clinic 
135 
level. 
136 
The protocol was approved by the ethics committees of the Medical Research Council of Zimbabwe and 
137 
London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. Eligible participants provided written informed consent 
138 
to participate in the trial. 
139 
Setting: In each of the 12 districts of Harare there were 5-8 clinics of varying size. The largest, known as 
140 
polyclinics, provided broad acute and chronic services and maternity care and were staffed by up to 14 
141 
nurses, 8 nurse aides and 12 LHWs. A physician visited every 2 weeks. Small satellite clinics provided acute 
142 
services and home-based nursing care and were staffed by 1-2 nurses and nurse aides and 3-4 LHWs. From 
143 
42 primary care clinics in Harare, we selected 24 clinics of the largest clinics that were in accessible 
144 
locations with mobile network coverage, had reliable data on stratification variables, and were willing to 
145 
be involved in the study. 
146 
Randomization and allocation concealment: Clinics were randomized in a 1:1 ratio within 5 strata based on 
147 
HIV status, housing density, clinic size, and sex of patients. Restricted randomization was used to minimize 
148 
imbalance in key factors (HIV prevalence, clinic size, staff size, and sex ratio) as described previously14. The 
149 
research assistants responsible for outcome assessment were masked to the allocation. 
150 
Participants: All adults attending trial clinics during a 2-week period were informed about the study, 
151 
including explanation about common mental disorders and how these can affect other conditions, such as 
152 
hypertension, HIV, and diabetes. Following informed consent for screening, patients completed the Shona 
153 
Symptom Questionnaire (SSQ-14), a locally validated screening tool for common mental disorders15, re-
154 
validated for this study population8. On each day of screening, computer-generated preprinted random 
155 
numbers were used to select clinic attenders based on their queue position number. All persons randomly 
156 
selected  who were aged >18 years and resident in the area were eligible for further assessment if they 
157 
screened positive (≥9) on the SSQ-14. Screening ended when 24 participants had been enrolled. All persons 
158 
 8 
 
who were unable to comprehend the nature of the study in either English or Shona (local language), had 
159 
suicidal intent, end-stage AIDS, were currently in psychiatric care, were pregnant or up to 3 months post-
160 
partum, presented with current psychosis, intoxication, and/or dementia were excluded. Those excluded 
161 
for psychiatric reasons were referred to a tertiary health care facility in Harare. Those with suicidal ideation 
162 
on the SSQ-14 but not subsequently assessed as having suicidal intent were included in the study.  
163 
Intervention: The Friendship Bench intervention has been developed over a 20-year period from 
164 
community research16-18, as described previously14. This intervention is problem-solving therapy, in which 
165 
the patient identifies a problem (eg, unemployment) rather than a diagnosis or symptom. is the 
166 
intervention has been shown to be feasible and acceptable in this resource-poor setting7,13. The 
167 
psychological approach of problem-solving therapyworks through enabling a more positive orientation 
168 
towards resolving problems and empowering people to have a sense of greater coping and control over 
169 
their lives19. In practical terms participants were taught a structured approach to identifying problems and 
170 
finding workable solutions20. Lay health workers followed a detailed script contained in a manual to 
171 
conduct 6 sessions on a bench located in a discreet area outside the clinic7. The first session includes three 
172 
components named Opening the Mind (kuvhura pfungwa), Uplifting (kusimudzira) and Strengthening 
173 
(kusimbisa)12 with subsequent sessions building on the first21. Opening the mind refers to the therapeutic 
174 
process by which, through asking questions, clients were encouraged to open their minds to identify their 
175 
problems, choose one to work on, identify a feasible solution, and agree an action plan through an 
176 
iterative process guided by the LHWs. The care model was driven by a trained and supervised LHW 
177 
attached to the clinic and employed by the local health authority. After 6 sessions of individual therapy, the 
178 
LHW referred those not improving or with suicidal ideation to a supervisor trained in mental health to re-
179 
assess and manage the case if needed. Participants in the intervention group received up to 6 text 
180 
messages and/or phone calls during the intervention, which reinforced the problem-solving therapy 
181 
approach and encouraged clients, particularly those attending less than 3 sessions during the first 4 weeks, 
182 
to follow their action plan. As part of the improved management program, clients were re-assessed by the 
183 
LHW after the third session using the SSQ-14, and those whose score had worsened by 1 or more or who 
184 
 9 
 
had suicidal ideation were assessed by a psychiatrist. These results were not used for research purposes. If 
185 
participants missed a session, the LHWs followed up with a phone call and/or a home visit if there was no 
186 
response.  
187 
All LHWs in the study were female with a mean age of 53, mean of 10 years of education, able to use a 
188 
mobile phone and residing near their respective clinic. They were supervised and supported by trained 
189 
senior health promotion officers who were part of the existing supervisory systems for LHWs. The LHWs 
190 
were trained over 9 days using a manual written by the Friendship Bench team21. Topics included Common 
191 
mental disorders, counselling skills, problem-solving therapy , and self-care.  All sessions were audio-
192 
recorded for fidelity, and assessed using a checklist to ensure LHWs had covered all the critical 
193 
components.  
194 
After 4 individual sessions, all intervention group participants were invited to join a peer-led group called 
195 
Circle Kubatana Tose, or “holding hands together” which was part of the intervention as described in the 
196 
protocol14. This component provided group support from women who had attended the Friendship Bench 
197 
prior to the trial and who had received basic group management training by study clinicians. These weekly 
198 
meetings consisted of sharing personal experiences while crocheting a bag from recycled plastic materials, 
199 
the latter being an income-generating skill for participants through selling the bags. Participants in the 
200 
intervention group were also offered enhanced usual care. 
201 
Enhanced Usual Care (EUC): The control group received the standard usual care consisting of a nurse-led 
202 
evaluation, brief support counselling and option for medication, as well as information, education and 
203 
support on common mental disorders including assessment for anti-depressant medication prescribed by 
204 
the clinic nurse and/or referral to a psychiatric facility if needed. Participants also received 2-3 supportive 
205 
SMS messages or calls with the last message being a reminder to attend the 6-months assessment. 
206 
Participants in both groups were not aware which group was the intervention. Further details of both the 
207 
intervention and EUC have been previously reported14.  
208 
Outcomes: The primary outcome was SSQ-14 symptom score15 measured as a prespecified continuous 
209 
variable at 6 months. The SSQ-14 was developed and validated in Zimbabwe and has good psychometric 
210 
 10 
 
properties in a primary care population. It is scored from 0-14 with higher score meaning worse symptoms, 
211 
and a cut-point of >9 has 84% sensitivity and 73% specificity for any CMD.8 The secondary outcome was 
212 
prevalence of symptoms of major depressive disorder based on the Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ-
213 
9), defined as a total score ≥11 on a range of 0-27, fulfilling criteria through a diagnostic algorithm22 and 
214 
with higher scores meaning worse symptoms. The protocol originally had the PHQ-9 cut-point at 9 
215 
(Supplement). However, this was altered after validation of the PHQ-9 in the study population found that 
216 
11 was a more appropriate cut-point.14 Analysis of PHQ-9 scores as binary variables was prespecified in the 
217 
trial protocol; however, analysis of PHQ-9 scores as continuous variables was not prespecified. Tertiary 
218 
outcomes were generalized anxiety disorder score (GAD-7)8,23 on a range of 0=best-12; WHO-DAS 2.0  12-
219 
item score for disability (range 0=best-48); and EQ-5D total score for health-related quality of life(range 
220 
0=best-25). 
221 
Sample size: A sample of 24 clinics, each with 24 participants provided 80% power to detect an effect size 
222 
(standardised mean difference) in SSQ-14 score of 0.75 at follow-up, with 80% power and Type I error of 
223 
5%, assuming a between-cluster coefficient of variation (k)=0.2. The effect size was based on a recent 
224 
systematic review of LHW interventions with severity of CMD as an outcome14,24.   
225 
Statistical analysis: Data were collected using tablet computers, uploaded to a secure server using cloud 
226 
computing technology and exported to Stata 14.0 for cleaning and analysis. Baseline characteristics were 
227 
compared by trial group and follow-up status. Analyses were intention-to-treat and followed a pre-
228 
specified analysis plan according to CONSORT guidelines25, with Type 1 error of 0.05 and 2-sided testing. 
229 
Due to a high follow-up response rate (91%) we used complete case analysis and missing data were not 
230 
imputed. Analyses were based on cluster-level summary measures to take clustering by site into account, 
231 
because individual-level regression methods are not robust when there are few clusters26. For continuous 
232 
outcomes with normally distributed residuals, the intervention effect was estimated as the difference in 
233 
mean scores between groups using linear regression of the mean score (adjusted for HIV status, sex, 
234 
baseline SSQ-14 score, age and education (education  appeared imbalanced between groups at baseline). 
235 
An approximate variance was obtained from the residual mean square from a 2-way ANOVA of mean score 
236 
 11 
 
on strata and group. The 95% CI was estimated from this variance with a stratified t-test with 18 degrees of 
237 
freedom. For binary outcomes, the measure of effect was the prevalence ratio, analysed by analogous 
238 
methods using logistic regression. Pre-defined sensitivity analyses included adjustment for the following 
239 
factors:  age, sex, HIV prevalence and baseline SSQ-14 score, and effect-modification by HIV status, sex, 
240 
and baseline symptom severity. Education was added to the model after examining baseline characteristics 
241 
by arm.  Effect-modification was assessed by fitting an interaction term between intervention group and 
242 
the potential effect modifier on the cluster-level regression analysis, with p-value estimated by the t-test 
243 
using robust standard errors. 
244 
 
245 
Results 
246 
Study Participants: Across 24 clinics 2527 people were assessed for eligibility (Figure 1 and supplement 
247 
table 1) and 1854 (73.4%) were excluded. The main reason for exclusion was an SSQ-14 score below 9 
248 
(n=1550) followed by non-residence in the locality (n=128). Of 673 people eligible for the study, 100 (15%) 
249 
did not consent, leaving 573 participants enrolled (287 in the intervention group and 286 in the EUC 
250 
group). Recruitment took place from September to December 2014 (median 4 days of screening per clinic). 
251 
The mean number of participants per cluster was 23.9 (range 22-26). Most participants were female 
252 
(86.4%), married (67.5%), with a median age of 33 years (interquartile range 27-41) (Table 1). The mean 
253 
SSQ-14 score at baseline was almost the same across groups [10.4 (SD 1.33) and 10.5 (SD 1.33)] (Table 1). 
254 
HIV status was known for 498 (87.3%) participants, and prevalence was high (41.7%), as was the 
255 
proportion with suicidal ideation (13.1%). Participants in the intervention group were more likely to be 
256 
female, younger and better educated, and less likely to be HIV positive. At enrolment, most participants 
257 
(n=431, 75.1%) listed >3 problems that they were experiencing, with 74.1% reporting physical illness, 
258 
70.1% domestic violence/upheaval, and 66.2% loss of income. Prevalence of hypertension was 9.6% and 
259 
1.6% had diabetes.  
260 
 12 
 
Overall, 521 participants (91%) completed a 6-month follow-up interview (Figure 1), with similar follow-up 
261 
in men and women (92% and 91%). The median time between enrolment and follow-up was 171 days (IQR 
262 
166-176) in the intervention group and 173 days (IQR 168-176) in the EUC group. 
263 
Outcome evaluation: The primary outcome of SSQ-14 scores for common mental disorders was lower in 
264 
the intervention than in the control group (mean 3.81 (95% CI 3.28-4.34) vs 8.90 (95% CI 8.33-9.47); 
265 
adjusted mean difference (AMD) in SSQ-14 score=-4.86; 95% CI -5.63, -4.10; p<0.001; Table 2). The 
266 
prevalence ratio for symptoms of depression via prespecified binary variable analysis was lower in the 
267 
intervention group than in the control group (13.7% vs 49.9%, adjusted rate ratio (ARR)=0.28, 95% CI 0.22, 
268 
0.34, p<0.001). Similarly, there was improvement in depression symptoms as measured by non-
269 
prespecified continuous variables for the PHQ-9 scores (AMD=-6.36, 95% CI -6.45, -5.27; p<0.001). There 
270 
was also improvement in the tertiary outcomes: symptoms of generalized anxiety measured by  GAD-7 
271 
(AMD=-5.73, 95%CI -6.61, -4.85; p<0.001); disability measured by WHO-DAS (AMD=-6.08, 95%CI -7.46, -
272 
4.71; p<0.001);  and health-related quality of life measured by EQ-5D scores (AMD=0.12, 95%CI 0.08, 0.17; 
273 
p<0.001) (Table 2). The prevalence of depression symptoms, anxiety symptoms and disability were each 
274 
lower in the intervention group compared to the control at follow-up (adjusted risk ratios: PHQ-9 
275 
diagnostic algorithm=0.23, 95% CI 0.15, 0.33; GAD-7=0.26, 95% CI 0.19, 0.35; SSQ-14=0.21, 95% CI 0.15, 
276 
0.29; WHO-DAS=0.27, 95% CI 0.16, 0.44; Table 2). There was some evidence of a stronger intervention 
277 
effect among participants with a higher baseline SSQ-14 score (SSQ-14 >11 vs <11) for tertiary outcomes 
278 
(GAD-7, p-interaction=0.02; WHO-DAS, p-interaction=0.02) but not for SSQ-14 (p-interaction=0.19), PHQ-9 
279 
(p-interaction=0.10) or EQ-5D (p-interaction=0.20) (Figure 2). Following sensitivity analysis, there was no 
280 
evidence of effect-modification by HIV status or sex for any of the outcomes. The coefficient of variation 
281 
(k) was 0.21 for the SSQ-14 and 0.24 for the PHQ-9. Missing outcome was associated with baseline SSQ, 
282 
PHQ-9 and WHO-DAS scores. Baseline SSQ score was already adjusted for, and adjusting for baseline PHQ-
283 
9 and WHO-DAS had no effect on any results. The complete-case analysis should therefore be unbiased. 
284 
There was no evidence of harm associated with the intervention. At follow-up, 32 participants (12.3%) in 
285 
the control group and 6 (2.3%) in the intervention group were identified as having suicidal ideation.  
286 
 13 
 
Adherence to the intervention: The number of problem-solving therapy sessions attended was ascertained 
287 
for 267 (93.4%) participants in the intervention group. Each session lasted approximately 30-45 minutes 
288 
with the first session lasting about 1 hour. The median number of sessions received was 5 (IQR 4-6) and 97 
289 
participants (39.9%) received all 6 sessions. Sessions were a median 3 days apart (IQR 2-4). Data on 
290 
participation in the peer support group was available for 274 participants, and of these, 187 (68.3%) 
291 
attended at least 1 meeting. At follow-up 8.1% of control participants and 5.4% of intervention participants 
292 
reported receiving counselling in the previous 6 months, and 11.1% of control participants and 7.7% of 
293 
intervention participants reported visiting a spiritual healer. Fifteen intervention group participants and 34 
294 
in the control group were referred to tertiary care and prescribed fluoxetine.  
295

Discussion 
297 
Among individuals screening positive for common mental disorders in Zimbabwe, LHW administration of a 
298 
primary care-based problem solving therapy with education and support compared with standard care plus 
299 
education and support resulted in improved symptomatic outcomes. There was little evidence that this 
300 
effect was moderated by severity of symptoms as measured with the SSQ-14 or PHQ-9, but some evidence 
301 
of an interaction for tertiary outcomes (statistically significant (p=0.02) for WHO-DAS and GAD-7 but not 
302 
for EQ-5D) in which those with more severe symptoms at baseline had better outcomes, as seen in 
303 
previous trials27.  
304 
Our findings are consistent with evidence on problem-solving therapy from high income countries11. 
305 
Problem-solving therapy is an attractive option in a low resource context because unlike cognitive 
306 
behaviour therapy it does not require extensive training or complex skills. The trial showed benefits with 
307 
peer support as a voluntary option but was not able to isolate the mechanism of action or the relative 
308 
contribution of each component. Of note, peer support meetings continued after study closure and were 
309 
subsequently integrated into clinic activities. 
310 
A strength of our study was the use of tools with local cultural validity together with well-known measures 
311 
that had been rigorously tested in our setting8 . The intervention, developed in consultation with 
312 
 14 
 
stakeholders, was designed to be delivered with available resources in the primary health care system12. 
313 
Having a contextually relevant cadre of health workers to deliver the psychological therapy who were 
314 
perceived as mature and trustworthy by the community is likely to have been important in forming a 
315 
strong therapeutic alliance13,28. The study was well powered, outcome measures were locally validated, the 
316 
intervention was carefully monitored, and attrition rates were very low. Friendship Bench delivered by 
317 
LHWs was effective at reducing severity of common mental disorders as measured by a range of validated 
318 
tools. Several successful psychological interventions have been delivered by LHWs in Africa but none has 
319 
been scaled up29-32. Designing an intervention that is delivered within the health system and using existing 
320 
workers is key to ensuring future scalability.  
321 
 
322 
Limitations: This trial had several limitations. Endpoints were at 6 months and sustainability of effect 
323 
beyond this time is unknown. There were few men in the study, as they are less likely to attend primary 
324 
care clinics. However, in this trial men were as likely as women to join the peer support groups and to 
325 
remain in follow-up. The program scale-up includes male-only peer support groups. Research assistants 
326 
conducting follow-up interviews in the clinics could have ascertained allocation by the presence of the 
327 
Bench, but we attempted to minimize bias by keeping research assistants independent of intervention 
328 
delivery and implementation. Some symptoms such as insomnia and inability to function could be due to 
329 
distress as opposed to depression, however, the use of validated outcome tools for a range of common 
330 
mental disorders should have minimised this risk. Few participants in either group reported receiving any 
331 
form of counselling in addition to the trial, but participants may have sought help elsewhere. We were 
332 
unable to collect reliable information on the prescription of medications, but we do not expect this  to be 
333 
high based on our previous research7 and the small number of people referred to tertiary care across both 
334 
groups. Similarly, we were unable to ascertain whether those stepped up to see a nurse or specialist 
335 
received any other more intensive treatment apart from fluoxetine. At the initial assessment the 
336 
proportion of individuals regarded as high-risk were comparable across groups. More people were referred 
337 
to tertiary care in the control than the intervention group so any additional treatment would have reduced 
338 
 15 
 
the differences observed between groups. The intervention group had a lower proportion of people 
339 
assessed as at higher risk of suicide at follow-up. However, as with many cluster-randomized trials with 
340 
relatively few clusters26, there was some imbalance between groups which was adjusted for in the analysis. 
341 
Finally, this trial included a combination of supportive therapies (problem solving therapy and the peer-led 
342 
group) and did not permit isolated assessment of the effect of each specific therapy. 
343 
Conclusions 
344 
 Among individuals screening positive for common mental disorders in Zimbabwe, LHW-administered, 
345 
primary-care-based problem solving therapy with education and support compared with standard care 
346 
plus education and support resulted in improved symptoms at 6 months. Scaled-up primary care 
347 
integration of this intervention should be evaluated.
