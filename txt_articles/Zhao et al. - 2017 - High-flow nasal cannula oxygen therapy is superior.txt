Abstract
Background: High-flow nasal cannula oxygen (HFNC) is a relatively new therapy used in adults with respiratory
failure. Whether it is superior to conventional oxygen therapy (COT) or to noninvasive mechanical ventilation (NIV)
remains unclear. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether HFNC was superior to either COT or NIV
in adult acute respiratory failure patients.
Methods: A review of the literature was conducted from the electronic databases from inception up to 20 October
2016. Only randomized clinical trials comparing HFNC with COT or HFNC with NIV were included. The intubation
rate was the primary outcome; secondary outcomes included the mechanical ventilation rate, the rate of escalation
of respiratory support and mortality.
Results: Eleven studies that enrolled 3459 patients (HFNC, n = 1681) were included. There were eight studies
comparing HFNC with COT, two comparing HFNC with NIV, and one comparing all three. HFNC was associated
with a significant reduction in intubation rate (OR 0.52, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.79, P = 0.002), mechanical ventilation rate
(OR 0.56, 95% CI 0.33 to 0.97, P = 0.04) and the rate of escalation of respiratory support (OR 0.45, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.67,
P < 0.0001) when compared to COT. There was no difference in mortality between HFNC and COT utilization
(OR 1.01, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.53, P = 0.96). When HFNC was compared to NIV, there was no difference in the
intubation rate (OR 0.96; 95% CI 0.66 to 1.39, P = 0.84), the rate of escalation of respiratory support (OR 1.00,
95% CI 0.77 to 1.28, P = 0.97) or mortality (OR 0.85, 95% CI 0.43 to 1.68, P = 0.65).
Conclusions: Compared to COT, HFNC reduced the rate of intubation, mechanical ventilation and the
escalation of respiratory support. When compared to NIV, HFNC showed no better outcomes. Large-scale
randomized controlled trials are necessary to prove our findings.

 Background
High-flow nasal cannula oxygen (HFNC) is a relatively
new and increasingly used therapy in adults with acute
respiratory failure [1]. HFNC can deliver heated humidi-
fied oxygen through nasal prongs and provide much
higher and more predictable rates of gas flow (maximum
flow of 60 L/min) and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2)
(up to 1.0) [2–4].
HFNC has several advantages when compared to con-
ventional oxygen therapy (COT): (1) the high-flow rates
match the patient’s inspiratory flow rates, which creates
a positive pressure effect [5, 6] and reduces the anatomic
dead space [7]; (2) HFNC can deliver a predictable and
constant FiO2 [8]; (3) HFNC can increase the partial ar-
terial pressure of oxygen (PaO2)/FIO2 ratio, which re-
duces the entrainment of room air and the dilution of
oxygen [1, 2]; (4) the heated and humidified gas that is
inhaled can improve mucociliary motion and sputum
clearance [3, 9]; and (5) there is reduced upper airway
resistance, reduced work of breathing [10] and improve-
ment in thoraco-abdominal synchrony [11, 12]. Based
on the above advantages, several studies found that
HFNC could improve comfort level [13–15], increase
oxygenation [12, 14–17] and decrease the dyspnoea
score in adult patients [3, 12, 14, 17]. Nevertheless, there
has been no clear consensus on treatment outcomes
(such as intubation rate, escalated respiratory support
rate and mortality) [13, 18–22].
Compared to HFNC, noninvasive mechanical ventila-
tion (NIV) can create a much higher gas flow rate and
positive airway pressure but is not comfortable and has
many complications [23, 24]. Recently, well-designed
randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have not differenti-
ated the effect of HFNC and NIV on intubation rates and
mortality [18, 25]. To decrease complexity, a recently
published meta-analysis showed no significant differ-
ence in mortality or intubation rates when HFNC was
compared to COT and NIV [26]. The conclusion of this
study might be misleading: first, COT and NIV are very
different in terms of the mechanism of action and clin-
ical application; second, the combination of COT and
NIV not only increased patient heterogeneity but also
increased the power of statistical bias. A separate com-
parison of HFNC with COT and NIV should result in
more reasonable conclusions. Maitra et al. included
only six RCTs in their meta-analysis that compared
only the prognosis of higher respiratory support, and
found no significant difference between HFNC and ei-
ther standard oxygen therapy or NIV [27]. The small
number of studies included in the meta-analysis makes
its application limited.
Therefore, we conducted a meta-analysis to investigate
the effect of HFNC on the rates of intubation, mechan-
ical ventilation, the escalation of respiratory support and
its effect on mortality versus COT or NIV in adult
patients with respiratory failure.
Methods
We conducted a systematic review in accordance with the
methods recommended in the Preferred Reporting Items
for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA)
guidelines [28].
Search strategy
Using electronic and manual searching, a literature re-
view was performed from the electronic databases incep-
tion up to 20 October 2016 in the Cochrane Library,
Embase and Ovid Medline without language restrictions.
The following search terms were used: ‘hfnc’
, ‘hfnp’
,
‘hhfnox’
, ‘hfno’
, ‘(high flow) adj5 nasal’
, ‘(high flow) adj5
oxygen’
, ‘high-flow adj5 nasal’ and ‘nasal adj5 (high flow)’.
The search strategy is in the Appendix (Additional file
1). In addition, we manually searched clinical trials.gov
and the bibliographies of randomized controlled trials,
meta-analyses, and systematic reviews to identify other
potentially relevant studies. The references of all in-
cluded articles were also checked manually to identify
additional eligible studies. The literature review was con-
ducted independently by two authors (HYZ and HXW).
Disparities in the literature review were resolved by a
consensus of all authors.
Inclusion and exclusion criteria
The following criteria were used for inclusion in our
meta-analysis:
1. Type of study: randomized controlled trials;
2. Population: adult patients with respiratory failure
who received oxygen therapy;
3. Intervention: HFNC treatment compared either
COT or NIV;
4. Predefined outcomes: intubation, mechanical
ventilation (includes noninvasive mechanical
ventilation and invasive mechanical ventilation),
escalation of respiratory support (HFNC, NIV or
intubation) and mortality.
If there was more than one eligible trial from one
team, the study with the most recent publication date
was used in the analysis.
Exclusion criteria: the types of articles excluded from
the analysis were reviews, retrospective studies, observa-
tional studies, case reports, animal studies, studies con-
ducted on children, studies examining only psychological
mechanisms, unrelated studies (e.g., HFNC not used in
patients), duplicate reports, studies involving repeated
experiments (commentary articles on specific studies or
secondary analyses of experimental data), studies not in

 either the English or the Chinese language and non-
randomized trials.
The primary outcome of our study was to investigate
whether HFNC versus COT or HFNC versus NIV re-
sulted in a similar intubation rate. The secondary out-
comes were whether HFNC versus COT had similar
rates of mechanical ventilation and rates of escalation of
respiratory support and mortality, and whether HFNC
versus NIV had similar rates of escalation of respiratory
support and mortality.
Data extraction
Two reviewers (HYZ and HXW) extracted the data in-
dependently using a predefined data extraction form.
Disagreements were resolved through discussion or
consensus with a third reviewer (FS). The data extracted
included the study ID (together with the first author’s
name and publication year), country, study design, setting,
control therapy, duration of therapy, primary and second-
ary outcomes and clinical outcomes. We also checked the
supplementary files and contacted the authors for more
detailed information if necessary.
Quality assessment and publication bias
Two independent reviewers assessed the methodological
quality of the included trials using the Cochrane Collab-
oration Risk of Bias tool [29] within the RevMan5.3 soft-
ware, which considers seven different domains: adequacy
of sequence generation; allocation sequence concealment;
blinding of participants and caregivers; blinding for
outcome assessment; incomplete outcome data; selective
outcome reporting; and the presence of other potential
sources of bias not accounted for in the other six domains
(the current research primarily refers to receiver sponsor-
ship or oxygen therapy devices from Fisher and Paykel
Healthcare or from other organizations). Based on the
method of the trials, each was graded as “yes”, “no” or “un-
clear”, to reflect a high, low risk or uncertain risk of bias,
respectively. Two reviewers (HYZ and HXW) made judg-
ments independently. In cases of disagreement, resolution
was first attempted by discussion and then by consulting a
third author (FS) for arbitration.
Funnel plots were used to assess the possibility of pub-
lication bias and were implemented in RevMan 5.3 soft-
ware. The Egger regression test was used to measure
funnel plot asymmetry [30] and was implemented using
Stata 12.0 (StataCorp LP, TX, USA).
Grading the quality of the evidence
We used the methodology of the Grades of Recommenda-
tion, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE)
Working Group to assess the overall quality of the evi-
dence for the primary and secondary outcomes in the fol-
lowing domains: risk of bias, inconsistency, indirection,
imprecision and publication bias. These were classified as
very low, low, medium and high [31].
Statistical analysis
Statistical analyses were performed using RevMan 5.3
software (Cochrane Library, London, UK). We combined
data from all trials to estimate the pooled odds ratio
(OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the rates of
intubation, mechanical ventilation, escalation of respira-
tory support and mortality. Pooled ORs with 95% CI
were estimated by the Mantel-Haenszel method. ORs
were undefined and excluded for studies with no event
in either arm. The analysis was performed using a random
effects model. Heterogeneity was tested using a weighted
Mantel-Haenszel χ2 test and was quantified using the I2
statistic as implemented in RevMan I2 values, which
describes the percentage of the variability in effect and
computes estimates that are due to heterogeneity rather
than sampling error. I2 values of 25–50% indicated low,
50–75% indicated moderate, and >75% indicated high
heterogeneity. A value >50% may be considered sub-
stantial heterogeneity [32]. A P value of 0.1 was used to
denote the statistical significance of heterogeneity. Dif-
ferences between subgroups were analysed using the
test of subgroup differences described by Deeks et al., and
the results were expressed using the P values. P < 0.05 was
considered statistically significant.
Subgroup analysis
We utilized subgroup analysis to assess possible influ-
ences of the oxygen therapy system on clinical out-
comes, which allowed us to explore the possible causes
of the heterogeneity. In the comparison of HFNC to
COT, we first explored whether there was a different
treatment effect of the oxygen therapy system in patients
with post-extubation acute respiration failure (ARF) and
patients with ARF that occurred for other reasons. Sec-
ond, we assessed the effect of trials that allowed COT to
escalate to HFNC versus those studies that did not.
Moreover, we also compared the results of RCTs with
patients from single-centre studies versus patients from
multi-centre studies.
Results
Study identification and selection
The initial search of the database revealed 754 articles,
and other sources revealed 24 articles. After the removal
of duplicates, there were 601 articles that were screened
based on their titles and abstracts to identify potentially
eligible trials. The full texts of 26 articles were assessed,
and 15 studies available in full text were excluded: 8
were not RCTs [10, 15, 16, 33–37]; 1 was not in the
English or Chinese language [38]; 4 did not include the
outcomes of our meta-analysis [39–42]; and 1 applied

(Additional file 2). In total, 10 RCTs (11 studies, 1 study
compared all three groups) [13, 18–22, 25, 44–47] were
eligible and were included in this meta-analysis, which ul-
timately included 3459 subjects. A PRISMA flow diagram
of the selection of studies is shown in Fig. 1.
The characteristics of individual studies included in
this meta-analysis are presented in Table 1. There was
one trial published over two articles: HFNC versus
COT [19] and HFNC versus NIV [25]. Eight studies
[13, 19–22, 44–46] compared HFNC with COT, and
two
studies
[25,
47]
compared
HFNC
with
NIV,
whereas another study [18] compared HFNC with both.
Two studies [13, 20] were conducted in emergency de-
partments (EDs), and others were conducted in inten-
sive care units (ICUs). Eight were multi-centre studies.
There were two studies performed in Australia [13, 44],
three in France [18, 45, 47], three in New Zealand [20,
22, 46], two in Spain [19, 25] and one in Italy [21].
For all RCTs in this meta-analysis, most of the domains
were evaluated as having low risk of bias (allocation se-
quence concealment, blinding for outcome assessment, in-
complete outcome data and selective outcome reporting
of domains). Most notably, blinding of participants and
personnel was not possible in these trials because of the
dramatic differences between HFNC, COT and NIV;
therefore, performance bias was considered to be a high
risk in all the studies. Other types of bias are herein re-
ferred to as commercial interference. Seven of the articles
[13, 18–20, 44–46] stated that the trial design and data
analysis was independent of commercial interference;
nevertheless, another three studies [21, 22, 47] did not
make this clarification. In addition, randomization of
sequence generation was unclear in two studies [45, 47]
because they did not describe the specific methods of
randomization. The risk of summary bias in individual
studies is shown in Fig. 2, Fig. 3 and Additional file 3.
Funnel plots were visually inspected and did not dem-
onstrate evidence of publication bias (Fig. 4) The Egger
regression test showed that the tests of asymmetry were
not significant for any of the endpoints, including in-
tubation rate for HFNC versus COT (OR −0.48, 95% CI
−2.45, 1.65, P = 0.65); HFNC versus NIV (OR 0.27, 95%
CI −331.57, 345.82, P = 0.83), and for secondary out-
comes, HFNC versus COT for mechanical ventilation
rate (OR −0.56, 95% CI −2.80, 1.72, P = 0.59), escalation

 rate (OR −1.73, 95% CI −3.35, 0.52, P = 0.13), and mor-
tality rate (OR −0.28, 95% CI −3.17, 2.65, P = 0.80);
HFNC versus COT for escalation rate (OR 0.60, 95% CI
−125.28, 137.65, P = 0.66), and mortality rate (OR −0.75,
95% CI −203.51, 180.89, P = 0.80) (Additional file 4).
The GRADE quality evidence was assessed within
GRADEpro software, and the results were as follows: for
comparison of HFNC with COT, the quality of evidence
on intubation rate and escalation rate was thought to be
moderate, whereas evidence on the mechanical ventila-
tion rate and mortality was thought to be low. The com-
mon reason for the demotion of RCTs was mainly a lack
of blinding. For the rate of mechanical ventilation, the
other reason was inconsistency, and for mortality, it was
imprecision.
On assessment of the GRADE quality evidence of
studies that compared HFNC with NIV, the quality of
evidence on the intubation rate and mortality was
thought to be very low, mainly because of the lack of
blinding, inconsistency and imprecision. The quality of
evidence on the escalation rate was thought to be low,
and the main reason was a lack of blinding and impreci-
sion. The summary of the findings and the quality of the
analysis is provided in Table 2 and Table 3.
Primary outcomes
Compared to COT, HFNC was associated with a signifi-
cant reduction in the intubation rate (OR 0.52, 95% CI
0.34 to 0.79, P = 0.002; M-H random; n = 1854; hetero-
geneity I2 = 9%, P = 0.36) (Fig. 5a).
No difference was found in the intubation rates be-
tween HFNC and NIV therapy (OR 0.96, 95% CI 0.66
to 1.39, P = 0.84; M-H random; n = 1651; heterogeneity
I2 = 53%, P = 0.12) (Fig. 5b).
Secondary outcomes
Nine RCTs that recruited 1914 patients showed that the
use of HFNC significantly reduced the mechanical venti-
lation rate (OR 0.56, 95% CI 0.33 to 0.97, P = 0.04), and
the heterogeneity was moderate with I2 = 60% for het-
erogeneity (P = 0.01, M-H random) (Fig. 6a).

 The overall rate of escalation of respiratory support
was also significantly lower in the HFNC group when
compared with the COT group (OR 0.45, 95% CI 0.31
to 0.67, P < 0.00001), and the heterogeneity was low
with I2 = 34% for heterogeneity (P = 0.15, M-H random)
(Fig. 6b). Only five RCTs [18–22] expressed data on
mortality, and there was no difference between HFNC and
COT therapies (OR 1.01, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.53, P = 0.96;
M-H random; n = 1497; heterogeneity I2 = 0%, P = 0.52)
(Fig. 6c).
Three RCTs that included 1651 patients compared
HFNC with NIV. There was no significant difference in
the rate of escalation of respiratory support (OR 1.00,
95% CI 0.77 to 1.28, P = 0.97; M-H random; heterogen-
eity I2 = 17%, P = 0.30) (Fig. 7a) or in mortality (OR 0.85,
95% CI 0.43 to 1.68, P = 0.65; M-H random; heterogen-
eity I2 = 69%, P = 0.04) (Fig. 7b).
Subgroup analysis of HFNC versus COT
Reasons for ARF
Subgroup analysis showed that four trials included pa-
tients with post-extubation ARF [19, 21, 22, 44] and
were associated with a significant reduction in the intub-
ation rate (OR 0.37, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.70, P = 0.002; M-H
random;
n = 1128;
heterogeneity
I2 = 10%,
P = 0.34).
However, the other four trials included patients with
AFR due to other reasons [13, 18, 20, 45], and there was
no significant effect on the intubation rate (OR 0.72,
95% CI 0.44 to 1.19, P = 0.20; M-H random; n = 726; het-
erogeneity I2 = 0%, P = 0.73).
Escalation stage
In the subgroup analysis, a significant reduction was also
observed (OR 0.51, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.81, P = 0.004; M-H
random; n = 1258; heterogeneity I2 = 21%, P = 0.28) when
COT was not allowed to progress to HFNC [18–21, 45].

 heterogeneity I2 = 23%, P = 0.27) when COT was allowed
to progress to HFNC [13, 22, 44].
Type of study design
In the subgroup analyses of the two single-centre trials [20,
22], there was no effect on the intubation rate (OR 1.01,
95% CI 0.06 to 16.73, P = 1.00; M-H random; n = 663; het-
erogeneity I2 = 55%, P = 0.14). However, in six multi-centre
trials [13, 18, 19, 21, 44, 45], there was a significant reduc-
tion in the incidence of intubation (OR 0.51, 95% CI 0.34 to
0.77, P = 0.001; M-H random; n = 1191; heterogeneity I2 =
6%, P = 0.38). The primary and secondary outcomes of the
subgroup analysis are shown in Additional file 5.
Discussion
The main finding of our study was that HFNC signifi-
cantly reduced the rate of intubation, mechanical venti-
lation and escalation of respiratory support compared
with COT in adult patients with respiratory failure, but
there was no difference in mortality. On the other hand,
when compared to NIV, no significant difference in in-
tubation rate, escalation of respiratory support rate or
mortality was detected.
Our results were partially different from two recent
meta-analyses of HFNC in adult patients [26, 27]. Our
meta-analysis was registered on the PROSPERO website
before the other authors published, and we included

 more RCTs (11 RCTs recruiting 3459 patients); Maitra
et al. only included 6 RCTs in their meta-analysis and
only compared the prognosis of higher respiratory sup-
port, while also finding no significant difference between
HFNC and standard oxygen therapy or NIV [27]. We in-
cluded more outcomes for HFNC, including intubation
rate, mechanical ventilation rate, the rate of escalation of
respiratory support and mortality. Furthermore, we fo-
cused on various prognostic indicators of HFNC com-
pared with COT or NIV, to decrease the population
heterogeneity and population bias of the sample.
Our meta-analysis found that HFNC also significantly
reduced the rate of intubation, mechanical ventilation
and the escalation of respiratory support compared to
COT. HFNC is superior to COT due to the delivery of
heated humidified oxygen, higher and more predictable
gas flow rates and rates of FiO2, a positive pressure ef-
fect and improvement in sputum clearance [3, 4]. Never-
theless, HFNC did not reduce mortality when compared
to COT, which could be explained by the complex
causes of respiratory failure. Frat et al. [18] enrolled pa-
tients in the ICU with acute respiratory failure, most of
which had community-acquired pneumonia. Jones et al.
[20] included patients in the ED with respiratory failure
with the main cause indicated as chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease (COPD). The other three RCTs in-
cluded patients with respiratory failure post extubation
[19, 21, 22], and patients in the study of Parke et al. [22]

 were included after undergoing cardiac surgery. In
addition, in three RCTs [13, 22, 44] COT was allowed to
escalate to HFNC, and the subgroup analysis found no
significant differences in the intubation rate between the
two groups, which suggests early conversion to HFNC
after failure of COT. Care should also be taken since some
patients could not tolerate HFNC: in the study of Jones
[20], 11 of 172 patients did not tolerate HFNC and were
placed on COT. Finally, the prolonged use of HFNC could
result in delayed intubation and increased mortality [48].
NIV has been proven to improve gas exchange and re-
duce the need for intubation and mortality in patients
with respiratory failure, especially in patients with an ex-
acerbation of COPD and those with acute cardiogenic
pulmonary oedema [49, 50]. Compared with NIV, HFNC
has some advantages, such as greater patient comfort,
lower costs, increased ease in clearing secretions [34]
and a lower incidence of adverse effects that could lead
to a poorer outcome [18]. We included three RCTs that
showed no difference between HFNC and NIV in terms
of intubation rate and mortality, which suggests that
HFNC was not inferior to NIV pertaining to the pa-
tients’ prognoses, at least in patients with hypoxaemic
respiratory failure. Of the three RCTs, Frat et al. [18]
enrolled patients in the ICU with acute hypoxaemic
respiratory failure and excluded chronic respiratory
failure and cardiogenic pulmonary oedema. A study by
Stephan [47] enrolled hypoxemic patients after cardiothor-
acic surgery. Hernandez et al. [25] included patients with
post-extubation respiratory failure and excluded those
with hypercapnia. The exacerbation of COPD and acute
cardiogenic pulmonary oedema may require further study.

 A few RCTs [19, 22, 25] showed that the length of
ICU stay was not influenced by choice. Parke et al. [22]
reported no difference in HFNC compared with COT
(HFNC 33.4 h versus COT 28.9 h, P = 0.08 [22], and
Hernandez et al. [19, 25] reported that the patients’
length of stay in the ICU was similar between HFNC
and COT (6 days (IQR 2–8) with HFNC versus 6 days
(IQR 2–9) with COT, P = 0.29), and between HFNC and
NIV (9 days (IQR 4–19) in HFNC versus 10.5 days (IQR
5–19) in NIV, P = 0.23). Thus, more RCTs are necessary
in the future.
There are several limitations to our meta-analysis.
First, the causes of the respiratory distress were hetero-
geneous in the patients recruited for the studies in-
cluded. The studies included in the meta-analysis had
been performed by researchers who operated independ-
ently, and the subjects or interventions in these studies
would have differed in ways that could have impacted
the results; therefore, we used a random-effects model
to make the outcomes conservative and easy to justify.
The subgroup analysis showed that HFNC may be more
suitable for patients with post-extubation ARF. Second,
the duration of treatment and the modes of HFNC and
NIV were also variable, which further increased the
heterogeneity. Third, all the RCTs included had a high
risk of performance bias due to the dramatic differ-
ences between HFNC, COT and NIV, which made
blinding impossible. Finally, all the studies included in
this meta-analysis received sponsorship from Fisher
and Paykel Healthcare, although most of the articles
[13, 18–20, 44–46] state that the study design and data
analysis were independent of commercial interference.
Conclusions
In conclusion, compared with COT, HFNC reduced the
rate of intubation, mechanical ventilation and escalation
of respiratory support. When compared to NIV, HFNC
showed similar results. Large-scale randomized con-
trolled trials are necessary to confirm our findings.
Key messages
� HFNC showed promise in reducing the need for
intubation, mechanical ventilation and escalation of
respiratory support compared to COT. Large-scale
randomized controlled trials are needed to provide
more robust evidence.
