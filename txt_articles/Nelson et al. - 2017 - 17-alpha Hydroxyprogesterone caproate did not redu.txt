Abstract
Background—17-alpha hydroxyprogesterone caproate for prevention of recurrent preterm birth 
is recommended for use in the United States.
Objective—To assess the clinical effectiveness of 17-alpha hydroxyprogesterone caproate to 
prevent recurrent preterm birth ≤ 35 weeks compared to similar births in our obstetric population 
prior to the implementation of 17-alpha hydroxyprogesterone caproate.
Study Design—This was a prospective cohort study of 17-alpha hydroxyprogesterone caproate 
in our obstetric population. The primary outcome was the recurrence of birth ≤ 35 weeks for the 
entire study cohort compared to a historical referent rate of 16.8% of recurrent preterm birth in our 
population. There were three secondary outcomes. First, did 17-alpha hydroxyprogesterone 
caproate modify a woman’s history of preterm birth when taking into account her prior number 
and sequence of preterm and term births? Second, was recurrence of preterm birth related to 17-
alpha hydroxyprogesterone caproate plasma concentration? Third, was duration of pregnancy 
modified by 17-alpha hydroxyprogesterone caproate treatment compared to a prior preterm birth?
Results—Between January 2012 and March 2016, 430 consecutive women with prior births ≤ 35 
weeks were treated with 17-alpha hydroxyprogesterone caproate. Nearly two-thirds of the women 
(N=267) began injections ≤ 18 weeks and 394 (92%) received a scheduled weekly injection within 
10 days of reaching 35 weeks or delivery. The overall rate of recurrent preterm birth was 25% 
(N=106) for the entire cohort compared to the 16.8% expected rate (P = 1.0). The three secondary 
outcomes were also negative. First, 17-alpha hydroxyprogesterone caproate did not significantly 
reduce the rates of recurrence regardless of prior preterm birth number or sequence. Second,

 plasma concentrations of 17-alpha hydroxyprogesterone caproate were not different (P=0.17 at 24 
weeks; P=0.38 at 32 weeks) between women delivered ≤ 35 weeks and those delivered later in 
pregnancy. Third, the mean (± standard deviation) interval in weeks of recurrent preterm birth 
before 17-alpha hydroxyprogesterone caproate use was 0.4 ± 5.3 weeks and the interval of 
recurrent preterm birth after 17-alpha hydroxyprogesterone caproate treatment was 0.1 ± 4.7 
weeks (P=0.63). A side effect of weekly 17-alpha hydroxyprogesterone caproate injections was an 
increase in gestational diabetes. Specifically, the rate of gestational diabetes was 13.4% in 17-
alpha hydroxyprogesterone caproate treated women compared to 8% in case-matched controls 
(P=0.001).
Conclusions—17-alpha hydroxyprogesterone caproate was ineffective for prevention of 
recurrent preterm birth and was associated with increased rates of gestational diabetes.

INTRODUCTION
Prevention of preterm birth is a major focus in obstetrics due to the burden of neonatal 
morbidity and mortality on mothers, infants, families, and society both medically and 
financially. Dollar costs due to prematurity in the United States in 2006 were estimated to 
exceed $26 billion.1 Moreover, the consequences of prematurity include long-term 
neurological complications due to immaturity related injuries to the brain.2 Consequently, 
development of interventions to reduce the rate of preterm birth have been emphasized in the 
United States for several decades. A recent example is the widespread use of progestogens to 
prevent preterm birth.3–9
17-alpha hydroxyprogesterone caproate (17-OHPC), a synthetic progestogen, is the first and 
only agent to date approved for marketing by the United States Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) for prevention of recurrent preterm birth.10 This approval stems from 
a trial by Meis and colleagues published in 2003.3 Following FDA approval, the American 
College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) and the Society for Maternal-Fetal 
Medicine (SMFM) endorsed use of 17-OHPC for prevention of recurrent preterm birth in 
singleton gestations.11,12 Most recently (January 2017), the SMFM Publications Committee 
recommended 17-OHPC be used for prevention of recurrent preterm birth and that vaginal 
progesterone should not be considered a substitute for 17-OHPC.13 The SMFM Publications 
Committee also concluded that despite their recommendations, there continued to be 
underutilization of 17-OHPC.13 It is important to emphasize that the FDA approval of 17-
OHPC was under a regulatory pathway (Subpart H of the FDA Code of Regulations) used 
when the decision is made on the basis of a surrogate endpoint—delivery less than 37 weeks 
of gestation in this case—and was deemed to require further studies.14 In fact, another 
placebo-controlled randomized trial of 17-OHPC is in progress in the United States and 
elsewhere with the FDA-preferred primary end-point of delivery less than 35 weeks 
gestation. Details of this ongoing trial titled, “Confirmatory Study of 17P Versus Vehicle for 
the Prevention of Preterm Birth in Women With a Previous Singleton Spontaneous Preterm

 Delivery (PROLONG),” can be found at: https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/
NCT01004029.14,15 This study began in October 2009 with an originally predicted date for 
conclusion of October 2013 which has been moved to 2018.14,15 This trial is sponsored by 
the manufacturer Lumara Health, Inc.
We decided to introduce 17-OHPC into our clinical practice and organized a study for 
introduction. We elected not to attempt a single-center randomized trial due to the high 
expense of such trials as well as the fact that the prevalence of recurrent preterm birth 
essentially obviates a single-center trial in a practical time period. Moreover, we wanted to 
perform a “real-world” study given the generalizability limitations of traditional randomized 
trials.16,17 We now report our experience with administration of 17-OHPC to women 
delivered at our hospital. We were particularly interested in the effectiveness of 17-OHPC 
using each woman—and her specific history of preterm birth—as the benchmark to measure 
response to therapy. Put another way, we introduced a widely used therapy in the United 
States to prevent recurrent preterm birth and measured whether or not this therapy was 
beneficial for the women actually treated in our practice.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study design
Parkland Hospital serves the medically indigent women of Dallas County and has developed 
a neighborhood-based, administratively and medically integrated public health care system 
for inner-city women. All women delivering at our hospital are routinely assigned to a 
Parkland Hospital neighborhood clinic for antenatal and postpartum care. Upon enrollment 
into prenatal care, women with a history of prior preterm birth are referred to the Preterm 
Birth Clinic centrally located at Parkland Hospital. This is a specific high-risk prenatal clinic 
staffed by maternal-fetal medicine faculty and fellows from the University of Texas 
Southwestern Medical Center. Criteria for referral to this clinic included a singleton 
pregnancy and prior spontaneous preterm birth or rupture of membranes between 20 0/7 and 
35 0/7 weeks gestation. All women were offered 17-OHPC therapy commencing January 1, 
2012. This project was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the University of 
Texas Southwestern Medical Center and Parkland Hospital.
The primary outcome of interest was recurrent preterm birth in women treated with 17-
OHPC. Every woman underwent a detailed review of her obstetric history by a research 
nurse using a pre-specified manual of operations. Review included the number of previous 
births, gestational age at preterm birth, reason(s) for preterm delivery, and perinatal 
outcome. Women with a prior medically-indicated preterm delivery—such as pregnancy 
hypertension or placental abruption were excluded. The study estimate of gestational age 
was based on the date of the last menstrual period and sonography. Data on prior obstetric 
history were linked to a pre-existing computerized obstetric database. This database contains 
maternal and infant outcomes for all women delivered at Parkland Hospital.

 17-alpha hydroxyprogesterone caproate (17-OHPC)
A local pharmacy provided compounded single-dose vials of 250 mg of 17-OHPC prepared 
in batches and delivered to the Parkland Hospital Pharmacy. Each batch was assayed for 
both potency and purity by an independent laboratory testing service (Eagle Analytical 
Services, Houston, TX). Potency testing was performed to ensure that each dose contained 
not less than 90% and not more than 110% of the specified 250 mg/mL 17-OHPC. Sterility 
testing was performed for bacteria, mold, yeast, and fungi. Our approach was similar to that 
reported by Chang and colleagues who evaluated the quality of 17-OHPC supplied by 15 
compounding pharmacies and did not identify safety concerns when assessed as we have 
described.18 Each 250 mg dose was purchased retail at $24.99 including testing procedures. 
Sesame oil was used as the vehicle for the 17-OHPC. Injections were commenced between 
16 0/7 and 20 6/7 weeks. Women received weekly injections at the Preterm Birth Clinic until 
36 weeks, or delivery. This was the 17-OHPC regimen reported by Meis et al and which is in 
use throughout the United States.3,11–13
Assessment of clinical effectiveness
The primary outcome was the overall rate of recurrent preterm birth ≤ 35 weeks. This 
gestational age was chosen because it was the pre-existing criteria for referral of women to 
the Preterm Birth Clinic. There were three secondary questions. First, did 17-OHPC modify 
a woman’s history of preterm birth when taking into account her prior number and sequence 
of preterm and term births? Second, was recurrence of preterm birth related to 17-OHPC 
plasma concentration? Third, was duration of pregnancy modified by 17-OHPC treatment 
compared to a prior preterm birth?
Number and sequence of prior preterm births—An individual womans’ risk for 
recurrent preterm birth is influenced by her past number of preterm birth(s) as well as the 
sequence of preterm and term births.19 That is, the rate of recurrence depends upon the 
number of prior preterm births suffered as well as the sequence of both preterm and term 
infants. For example, a risk of recurrent preterm birth for a gravida 3 para 2 woman with a 
prior preterm birth followed by a term birth differs from a woman with a prior term birth 
followed by preterm birth. Our purpose was to measure the effectiveness of 17-OHPC in 
women with such differing past preterm and term pregnancy histories.
Relationship of 17-OHPC plasma concentration to recurrent preterm birth—
Measurement of 17-OHPC concentrations in plasma became available during the trial. We 
opted to measure 17-OHPC concentrations to further validate use of our compounded 
progestogen. Specifically, we wanted to ensure that 17-OHPC was present in the plasma and 
concentrations were similar to those reported in the literature.20 Moreover, we wanted to 
examine the relationship between 17-OHPC concentration and spontaneous preterm birth. 
Blood was drawn coinciding with routine prenatal care blood draws at 24 and 32 weeks 
prior to administration of a scheduled 17-OHPC injection. The 24-week blood draw was for 
universal screening for gestational diabetes. Quantitative measurement of plasma 
concentration of 17-OHPC was performed using batch-run analyses and high-performance 
liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry with atmospheric pressure chemical ionization.

 All of these analyses were conducted by one of the co-investigators (JM). We then analyzed 
the relationship of 17-OHPC plasma concentrations to the rate of recurrent birth ≤ 35 weeks.
Severity of recurrent preterm birth—We sought to compare a specific womans’ weeks 
of gestation at a prior preterm birth not treated with 17-OHPC to the weeks gestation 
achieved in women who were treated.21 Put another way, we sought to determine the effects 
of 17-OHPC on the length of pregnancy. To do this, we compared the change in duration of 
pregnancy in women with recurrent preterm birth after treatment with 17-OHPC to women 
untreated and previously delivered preterm at our hospital.22
Screening for gestational diabetes
Universal screening for gestational diabetes has been in use at Parkland Hospital since 1998. 
A screening 50-gram oral glucose challenge was performed at 24 weeks in non-fasting 
women. Women with screening serum values ≥ 140 mg/dL were tested with a 3-hour 100-
gram glucose tolerance test. Gestational diabetes was diagnosed when two or more of the 
following values were abnormal: fasting ≥ 105 mg/dL; 1-hour ≥ 190 mg/dL; 2-hour ≥ 165 
mg/dL; 3-hour ≥ 145 mg/dL. Women with gestational diabetes were managed in 
coordination with a specific Gestational Diabetes Clinic held at Parkland Hospital.
Sample size calculation and statistics
The historical rate of recurrent birth ≤ 35 weeks in the Parkland Hospital general obstetric 
population was 16.8% when 17-OHPC was not in use.22 This rate was used to calculate the 
sample size necessary to assess the effectiveness of 17-OHPC. A sample size of 413 women 
was estimated for a 90% power to detect a one-third reduction in recurrent preterm birth 
(from 16.8% to 11.2%) using a one-sided, one-sample binomial test of size 0.025 (alpha = 
0.025), which is equivalent to a two-sided test of 0.05. A one-sided test was chosen because 
the anticipated change was a lowering of the recurrent preterm birth rate. Recurrence rates 
according to the prior number and sequence of specific histories of preterm and term 
pregnancies were also based upon the Parkland Hospital general obstetric population prior to 
17-OHPC implementation. Plasma concentrations of 17-OHPC in women with recurrent 
preterm birth were compared to concentrations in women without recurrence using the 
Wilcoxon rank-sum test. To assess severity of recurrent preterm birth, the change in 
gestational weeks of recurrent preterm births was compared using Student’s t test before and 
after 17-OHPC treatment.
The composition of the 17-OHPC study group was compared to the demographic 
characteristics of women in the historical cohort. To do this, it was necessary to match the 
prior preterm birth profiles of the women treated with17-OHPC to the historical cohort 
delivered after universal screening for gestational diabetes was instituted in 1998. A 3:1 
matched control group design was used to match for prior preterm birth profile as well as 
maternal race and body mass index (BMI). Statistical analysis was performed using SAS 9.3 
(SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC).

 RESULTS
Between 1 January 2012 and 31 March 2016, 456 consecutive women with prior births ≤ 35 
weeks were treated with 17-OHPC and delivered either at Parkland Hospital (86%) or at 
community hospitals (14%), Figure 1. A total of 26 (6%) women were excluded from this 
analysis; 21 were lost to follow-up and five delivered before 20 weeks gestation. Selected 
demographic characteristics of the 430 remaining women treated with 17-OHPC are shown 
in Table 1. The women were predominantly Hispanic and 43% had BMIs of 30 kg/m2 or 
more. Nearly two-thirds of the women (N=267) began 17-OHPC injections ≤ 18 weeks and 
394 (92%) received a scheduled weekly injection within 10 days of reaching 35 weeks or 
delivery. The 17-OHPC content of weekly injections was tested in 43 batches of 
approximately 200 doses per batch. The mean 17-OHPC content per dose was 249.25 mg.
As shown in Table 2, the overall rate of recurrent preterm birth was 25% (N=106) for the 
entire cohort treated with 17-OHPC compared to the 16.8% expected rate in the historical 
Parkland Hospital obstetric population (P = 1.0, one-sided test). All of the infants delivered 
of women treated with 17-OHPC were liveborn. We next analyzed each pregnancy 
according to specific obstetric history. As shown in Table 2, regardless of prior preterm birth 
number or sequence, 17-OHPC did not significantly reduce the rates of recurrence.
Drug concentrations were available for 116 of the 17-OHPC treated women at 24 weeks 
gestation and 101 at 32 weeks. The plasma concentration of 17-OHPC was 10.2 ± 5.2 
ng/mL and 12 ± 5.9 ng/mL at 24 weeks and 32 weeks, respectively. When analyzed at either 
blood draw time-point, concentrations of 17-OHPC were not different (P=0.17 at 24 weeks; 
P=0.38 at 32 weeks) between women delivered ≤ 35 weeks and those delivered later in 
pregnancy (Figure 2). Moreover, the plasma concentrations of 17-OHPC corresponded to the 
concentrations reported by Caritis and colleagues.20
The change in gestational weeks of recurrent preterm births in women treated with 17-
OHPC was compared to the change in weeks gestation in women previously untreated with 
17-OHPC but who delivered a recurrent preterm infant (Figure 3). The mean (±SD) interval 
in weeks of recurrent preterm birth before 17-OHPC use was 0.4 ± 5.3 weeks and the 
interval of recurrent preterm birth after 17-OHPC was 0.1 ± 4.7 weeks. There was not a 
statistical difference (ie. improvement) in the interval weeks of recurrent preterm birth after 
the implementation of 17-OHPC in our practice (P=0.63).
A total of 56 (13.4%) women treated with 17-OHPC were diagnosed to have gestational 
diabetes (all but 13 women given 17-OHPC had complete evaluations for gestational 
diabetes). Using 3:1 matched (control: case) for prior preterm birth profile, maternal race, 
and BMI, a total of 104 (8%) of the matched women not given 17-OHPC were diagnosed to 
have gestational diabetes, P=0.001. The same 3:1 case matched control groups were applied 
to compare maternal demographics of women treated with 17-OHPC to those untreated in 
the 1998–2011 historical cohort and there were no significant differences in recurrence of 
preterm birth.

 COMMENT
We introduced a new intervention to our obstetric service and felt a need to measure the 
effectiveness of 17-OHPC when given to prevent recurrent preterm birth. When 
prospectively compared to a historical cohort at our hospital, 17-OHPC did not improve the 
overall rate of recurrent preterm birth. We examined three secondary outcomes. First, the 
rates of recurrence were not improved by 17-OHPC when analyzed according to the specific 
sequence of prior preterm and term births. Second, 17-OHPC plasma concentrations were 
not different in women with and without recurrence. Third, 17-OHPC did not significantly 
increase the duration of pregnancy when those women with a recurrent preterm birth were 
compared to similar women not previously treated with 17-OHPC. A side effect of 17-
OHPC treatment was a significantly increased rate of gestational diabetes compared to case 
matched historical controls, 13.4% versus 8%, for 17-OHPC treated versus untreated, 
respectively.
Background
The study of 17-OHPC to prevent preterm birth is not new. In 1975, Johnson and colleagues 
randomized 43 women with prior preterm births or spontaneous abortions to weekly 250 mg 
injections of 17-OHPC or placebo to test the efficacy of a progestogen in preventing 
premature labor.23 Prior to this study, progestogens were used primarily in the prevention of 
spontaneous abortion rather than prevention of preterm birth. These investigators found that 
41% (9/22) of women given placebo delivered preterm compared to zero (of 14 women) 
given 17-OHPC, P<0.02.23 In contrast, Hauth and colleagues (1983) studied the efficacy of 
17-OHPC in a heterogeneous group of women on active-military duty and found no 
beneficial effect.24 A total of 168 women were randomized: 80 women were allocated to 17-
OHPC 1,000 mg intramuscular weekly and 88 were allocated to placebo. Premature labor 
occurred in 5/80 (6%) women given 17-OHPC compared to 5/88 (6%) randomized to 
placebo, P=0.88. Keirse analyzed seven trials of 17-OHPC published between 1964 and 
1985 using meta-analysis and found that 17-OHPC was associated with a reduction in 
preterm birth from 28% to 16% (OR 0.5; 95%CI 0.3–0.85).25 This meta-analysis was 
influential in the choice of 17-OHPC for the Meis et al trial that ultimately rekindled interest 
in the use of progestogens to prevent preterm birth.3,25 Meis et al reported a reduction in 
recurrence in 463 women randomized (2:1) to receive 17-OHPC or placebo with delivery 
before 37 weeks in 111/306 (36%) women receiving 17-OHPC compared to 84/153 (55%) 
receiving placebo (P<0.001).3 As a result of this study, 17-OHPC has become established in 
obstetric practice in the United States for prevention of recurrent preterm birth.11–13
Some have voiced concerns about the Meis et al trial.26–29 For example, Wesley in her 
review of the Meis et al trial for the FDA was concerned by the unexpectedly high rate 
(55%) of recurrent preterm birth in the control population.26 The expected rate had been 
37%. The problem was that the preterm birth rate was 36% in the 17-OHPC group, which 
was significant only in comparison to the unexpected 55% control group rate. One 
conclusion was that the benefit attributed to 17-OHPC was only seen because the rate of 
recurrence in the control group exceeded the expected frequency. An explanation offered for 
such a high rate of preterm birth in the control group was asymmetry in risk of recurrence.

 That is, the more prior preterm births a woman has, the greater the recurrence risk. Indeed, 
41% of the control women in the Meis et al trial had two or more prior preterm births 
compared to 28% in the 17-OHPC group (P=0.004). Correspondence and commentary to the 
publication of the Meis et al report raised another possibility for the higher rate of preterm 
birth in the control group.29,30 Brancazio and co-authors suggested the possibility that the 
castor oil placebo used by Meis et al could be implicated in stimulation of preterm uterine 
activity.30 Specifically, Brancazio and co-authors observed that castor oil had been 
previously used to induce labor.30 Meis et al responded that this explanation was unlikely 
because castor oil was used as the vehicle in the 17-OHPC group as well the control 
group.30 Moreover, Meis et al contend that castor oil in the small doses used in their trial 
was not recognized as an effective agent for inducing labor in pregnant women.30 Recent 
laboratory evidence suggests otherwise with O’Sullivan and colleagues reporting that human 
myometrial strips exposed to castor oil resulted in enhanced oxytocin-induced 
contractility.31 Because of these concerns related to castor oil, we chose to use sesame oil as 
the vehicle for 17-OHPC in our study. We point out that 17-OHPC plasma concentrations 
using sesame oil as the vehicle were virtually identical to prior reported levels using castor 
oil.20 Romero and Stanczyk had another concern about the Meis et al trial.27 The Meis trial 
was completed in two phases. The first phase included 150 subjects when it had to be 
stopped because of reported problems with the manufacture of 17-OHPC.26 The first phase 
cases were not included in the final published report.27 The rate of recurrence in the control 
group during the first phase was 36% compared to the 55% in the control group rate 
published by Meis et al.3 Thus, this 36% rate was equivalent to the 17-OHPC treated groups’ 
expected 37% rate – meaning that 17-OHPC was ineffective in the unpublished first phase of 
the Meis et al trial.
Diabetogenic effects of progestogens
It has long been known that maternal hormones to include estrogen and progesterone 
increase and promote pancreatic beta-cell hyperplasia and increased insulin.32 As pregnancy 
progresses, increased levels of a variety of hormones to include cortisol, prolactin, estrogen, 
and progesterone lead to insulin resistance which is considered central to the glucose 
intolerance associated with gestational diabetes. In contrast to estradiol which is considered 
to be a very weak diabetogenic factor, progesterone is considered a very strong factor with 
peak elevation at about 32 weeks gestation. Indeed, Rebarber and colleagues studied the 
diagnosis of gestational diabetes in 557 women given weekly 17-OHPC injections to prevent 
recurrent preterm birth compared to diagnosis of gestational diabetes in 1,524 women with 
prior preterm births but not given 17-OHPC.33 The incidence of gestational diabetes in the 
17-OHPC treated group was 12.9% compared to 4.9% in control subjects, P<0.001.33 These 
results are very much like our experience. We must conclude that 17-OHPC indeed has a 
biologic effect that may induce gestational diabetes.
Basic science observations on 17-OHPC for prevention of preterm birth
The biologic mechanisms by which progestogens prevent preterm birth are unknown. One 
proposed mechanism was that progestogens maintain uterine quiescence, however, the 
current hypothesis is that progestogens act as anti-inflammatory agents, possibly at the level 
of the uterine cervix.34–43 Nold and colleagues, using a murine model found that 17-OHPC

 had no effect on the pathways involved in uterine contractility, uterine quiescence, or 
cervical remodeling.44 Elovitz and Mrinalini also used a mouse model of localized uterine 
inflammation and found that pretreatment with 17-OHPC before intrauterine endotoxin 
exposure significantly decreased the preterm birth rate.45 However, such use of 17-OHPC 
was associated with significant maternal morbidity including behavioral changes and death45 
In contrast, Furcon and colleagues found that 17-OHPC did not have local anti-
inflammatory effects at the maternal-fetal interface or the cervix, and that 17-OHPC did not 
protect against endotoxin-induced preterm birth.43 Indeed, Furcon and co-authors reviewed 
the basic science on progestogen effects in their report and concluded that the laboratory 
evidence for 17-OHPC to influence preterm birth were weak compared to vaginal 
progesterone.43
Manuck and colleagues have studied the pharmacogenomics of 17-OHPC in the prevention 
of preterm birth.46,47 This approach to evaluating the effects of 17-OHPC was based on a 
human biologic fluid repository collected during the trial by Meis et al.46 Saliva was tested 
for 20 different progesterone receptor polymorphisms in 380 women. They found that an 
individuals’ response to 17-OHPC was modified by their progesterone receptor genotype. 
For example, 17-OHPC treatment reduced preterm births in some women with DNA variants 
compared to increased preterm births in women with other DNA variants. Manuck and 
colleagues also studied DNA extracted from stored blood buffy coats in 50 women managed 
at Intermountain Medical Center in Salt Lake City.47 Women who benefitted (ie 
“responded”) to 17-OHPC had specific overrepresented genes. Taken together, these 
investigations by Manuck and colleagues suggest that the benefits of 17-OHPC in prevention 
of recurrent preterm birth are modified by pharmacogenomics.46,47
17-OHPC pricing concerns
Other concerns about 17-OHPC for prevention of recurrent preterm birth involve the FDA 
approval history and subsequent price gouging claims.14,48 In 2006, a New Drug Approval 
application was submitted to the FDA for 17-OHPC. The initial application was denied and 
the FDA called for a confirmatory randomized trial with a larger sample size than the Meis 
et al trial.27 The rights to manufacture 17-OHPC were subsequently bought by KV 
Pharmaceutical. Once a confirmatory study was underway and 10% of the total sample size 
had been recruited from US sites, the FDA gave temporary approval to KV Pharmaceutical 
on 11 February 2011 to market 17-OHPC under the brand name Makena®.48 This approval 
was granted under the agency’s accelerated approval regulations. On 15 February 2011, KV 
Pharmaceutical announced the price of Makena® to be $1500 per injection. Given that 
pharmaceutical regulations prohibit compounding pharmacies from producing products that 
are commercially manufactured, KV Pharmaceutical had no competitors in pricing and was 
free to set the price as high as they thought the market would bear.48 There was widespread 
concern over pricing because the drug cost of Makena® would exceed more than $30,000 
per pregnancy. This was 75–150 times more than what formerly was being charged for the 
same medication that previously was available only through compounding pharmacies.48 To 
put this pricing into context, if there are 133,000 women with prior preterm births delivered 
each year in the United States,49 and each woman is given a total of 20 injections of 17-
OHPC (16 to 36 weeks), the income to the manufacturer using half-price, ie. $750 per 250

 mg dose of 17-OHPC, totals $1,990,000,000 per year. This almost $2 billion can be 
compared to the $25 per 250 mg dose (including potency and purity testing) for the 17-
OHPC used in our study that would total $66.5 million to treat these 133,000 women. This 
highlights the impact of a 30-fold increase in drug cost. Generally, the FDA has exercised 
enforcement discretion for most products made through traditional pharmacy compounding 
thus prohibiting producing compounded products that are commercially available. However, 
the FDA decided in the case of 17-OHPC to not take enforcement action against pharmacies 
that compound this drug and compounded 17-OHPC has consequently been available within 
the United States.
Are the results of randomized trials always validated in subsequent practice?
Stanley reviewed randomized controlled trials as a research method.50 A major factor in the 
advance of medical science over the past 50 years has been the development of the 
randomized controlled trial. To quote Stanley, “Nothing more clearly indicates the key role 
of a randomized clinical trial in modern clinical research than the placement of this research 
method at the top of the list of levels of evidence in evidence-based medicine.” Indeed, 
drugs approved for marketing by the FDA in the United States generally require two 
randomized trials showing efficacy of the drug in Phase III randomized clinical trials.51 Two 
trials are usually required because of the importance of reproducibility.52 The importance of 
reproducibility can be traced to Bradford-Hill who developed nine criteria—for how to 
separate causation from simple association. Fifty years after Bradford-Hill, Ioannidis 
assessed how well each of the nine criteria functioned and found reproducibility paramount 
in strengthening a cause-and-effect conclusion.53 Reproducibility was deemed to strengthen 
the cause-and-effect relationship if there were consistent findings observed by different 
persons in different places with different studies.53
When well conducted, randomized controlled trials have internal validity, meaning the 
ability to trace causal inferences to the tested intervention which in our study was 17-OHPC. 
Internal validity here means a carefully circumscribed experimental population that share 
likeliness to meet specified randomized controlled trial inclusion criteria. However, this can 
be a limitation when results of randomized controlled trials are applied to a more 
heterogeneous population deemed “real-world.” The criticism here is that the results of 
randomized controlled trials may not be generalizable to “real-world” populations.17,54 An 
example of this failure of generalizability is the recently reported trial titled, “A population-
based multifaceted strategy to implement antenatal corticosteroid treatment versus standard 
care for the reduction of neonatal mortality due to preterm birth in low-income and middle-
income countries: the ACT cluster-randomized trial” (ACT trial) where antenatal 
corticosteroid treatment was randomized in a study aimed at reducing neonatal mortality due 
to preterm birth in 349 total health facilities located in Argentina, Guatemala, India, Kenya, 
Pakistan, and Zambia.55 Clearly, use of antenatal corticosteroids based upon a systematic 
review of 21 randomized controlled trials has become a touchstone in contemporary 
perinatal therapy.56 Indeed, the systematic review showed a 31% relative reduction in 
neonatal mortality when antenatal corticosteroids were used in populations studied in the 
industrialized world.56 It was anticipated by the investigators of the ACT trial that 
administering antenatal corticosteroids to women at high-risk for preterm birth in

 populations where access to modern contemporary perinatal care was limited could 
dramatically reduce neonatal deaths.55 That is, antenatal corticosteroids administration 
offered the possibility of an inexpensive low-technology means of reducing neonatal 
mortality.55 The ACT trial took place between 2011 and March 2014 and included 48,219 
women in the antenatal steroid group compared to 51,523 women in the control group.55 
Among the whole population, 28-day neonatal mortality was 27.4 per 1000 livebirths for the 
intervention group and 23.9 per 1000 livebirths for the control group (relative risk 1.12, 
1.02–1.22, P=0.0127).55 Instead of the expected reduction in neonatal mortality, there was 
an excess of 3.5 neonatal deaths for every 1000 women given antenatal steroids.55 This 
result was attributed to the lack of access to ultrasound and neonatal intensive care in the 
populations studied.57 A recent study of ultrasound in similar countries (Pakistan, Kenya, 
Zambia, and Guatemala) gives lie to the notion that ACT failed due to lack of ultrasound.58 
Nonetheless, results of multiple randomized controlled trials were clearly not generalizable.
The lack of generalizability, which refers to external validity, becomes important when new 
therapies are applied in real-world settings. Nallamothu and co-authors writing in a report 
titled, “Beyond the Randomized Clinical Trial,” distinguished between efficacy (treatment 
which works under ideal circumstances as in a randomized controlled trial) and effectiveness 
(treatment that works in real-world circumstances).54 These authors concluded that 
observational studies are essential follow-on studies for translating findings from 
randomized controlled trials into routine clinical practice.54 Most recently, Sherman and 
colleagues writing on real-world evidence observed that there is increased interest in 
exploring and integrating clinical research into more diverse real-world settings by 
capitalizing on the exponential growth in access to data from electronic health records and 
other existing datasets.17 They mention studies involving historical controls such as used in 
our study.17 In the case of 17-OHPC, the evidence date includes only one randomized 
controlled trial with a FDA required second trial in progress. We note that post-market 
clinical research on drugs is generally considered Phase IV and that observational trials are 
included as a legitimate method for Phase IV studies.51
Conclusions
We wish to emphasize that our study of the effectiveness of 17-OHPC was unusual in that 
we not only assessed the overall effect of 17-OHPC on recurrence of preterm birth but also 
the effect on preterm birth recurrence in the context of variations in recurrence patterns. 
Specifically, the risk of recurrence intensifies in proportion to the number of prior preterm 
births as well as the inter-position (ie. order) of term/preterm, preterm/term births in the 
obstetric history. We summarize our experiences with the conclusion that we were unable to 
demonstrate any benefit for 17-OHPC to prevent recurrent preterm birth. We did find a side 
effect, specifically increased gestational diabetes when 17-OHPC was used in weekly 
injections. We conclude that the failure of 17-OHPC for prevention of recurrent preterm 
birth at our hospital and the published evidence suggests that 17-OHPC for prevention of 
recurrent preterm birth taken as a whole is at best problematic and has an important side 
effect.
