ABSTRACT 
The cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21WAF1/Cip1 (p21) is a cell-cycle checkpoint 
effector and inducer of senescence, regulated by p53. Yet, evidence suggests that, 
through a so-far obscure mechanism, p21 could also be oncogenic. We report that a 
subset of atypical cancerous cells strongly expressing p21 showed proliferation 
features. This occurred predominantly in p53-mutant human cancers suggesting p53-
independent upregulation of p21 selectively in more aggressive tumour cells. 
Multifaceted phenotypic and genomic analyses of p21-inducible, p53-null, cancerous 
and near-normal cellular models showed that after an initial senescence-like phase, a 
subpopulation of p21-expressing proliferating cells emerged, featuring increased 
genomic instability, aggressiveness and chemo-resistance. Mechanistically, sustained 
p21-accumulation inhibited mainly the CRL4CDT2 ubiquitin-ligase, leading to 
deregulated origin licensing and replication stress. Collectively, our data reveal 
tumour-promoting ability of p21 through deregulation of DNA replication licensing 
machinery, an unorthodox role to be considered in cancer treatment, since p21 
responds to various stimuli including some chemotherapy drugs.

Numerous proteins involved in key cellular processes display bimodality in 
cancer, acting either as tumour suppressors or oncoproteins (Supplementary Table 
S1). This phenomenon is commonly attributed to “cellular or environmental context”. 
Elucidating the mechanism(s) underlying such context-dependent duality is essential 
for rational design of cancer therapy. 
The cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor (CDKI) p21WAF1/Cip1 (p21) is a pivotal 
downstream effector of the tumour-suppressor p53, mediating mainly G1-phase arrest 
and cellular senescence in response to various stimuli.1 Several studies suggest that 
p21 can also manifest oncogenic properties (Supplementary Table S1). In some 
studies, p21’s oncogenic function was credited to unconventional cytoplasmic 
localization of p21 which inactivates pro-apoptotic proteins.2,3 Still, in most cases the 
underlying mechanism remains obscure. Notably, while p53 is frequently mutated in 
cancer,4 p21 is rarely affected genetically.1,5 The latter would be logical if p21 
operated exclusively within the p53 pathway. However, p21 is activated also by 
diverse p53-independent signals.1  
Replication licensing ensures that genome replication takes place once per cell 
cycle,6,7 due to the periodic expression of the replication licensing factors (RLFs) 
ORC, Cdt1 and Cdc6 that increase in late M to G1-phases and decrease in S/G2-
phases.8 Deregulation of the replication licensing process promotes genomic 
instability and tumorigenicity, mainly via unscheduled DNA re-replication.9,10,11,12 
Aberrant expression of RLFs occurs in diverse malignancies.13,14 Here we present a 
pathophysiological mechanism demonstrating that protracted p21 expression, in a p53 
loss-of-function environment, causes deregulation of the replication licensing 
machinery, replication stress and genomic instability.

RESULTS 
A subset of atypical p21-expressing cells in advanced-stage tumours and 
preneoplastic lesions show signs of proliferation  
In an array of human tumours we observed an intriguing relationship between 
p21 and the proliferation marker Ki67. While the anticipated mutually exclusive 
expression pattern of p21 and Ki67 was prevalent, consistent with p21’s growth-
inhibitory properties, there was a number of atypical cancer cells co-expressing p21 
and Ki67 (Fig. 1a-c). Atypical cancer cells commonly point to adverse prognosis.15 
Most of the carcinomas examined displayed p53 alterations.13,14,16 In preneoplastic 
lesions with p53 aberrations we noticed a similar phenomenon (Fig. 1d).17 The 
unexpected co-expression of p21 with Ki67 suggests either tolerance to high p21 
levels, or selection under chronic p21 expression allowing for emergence of a 
subpopulation of p21-positive cells which regained proliferative capacity and possibly 
acquired enhanced aggressiveness. 
 
p53-independent expression of p21 up-regulates replication licensing factors  
To address the impact of constitutive p21 expression in a p53-deficient context 
we employed two doxycycline-inducible (Tet-ON) p21 expressing cellular systems: 
one recapitulating the cancerous stage, based on Saos2, a p53-null human 
osteosarcoma cell line (Saos2 p21WAF1/Cip1 Tet-ON), and the other reflecting the 
precancerous stage by expressing the inducible module in the Li-Fraumeni-derived 
fibroblasts (MDAH041-Li-Fraumemi p21WAF1/Cip1 Tet-ON)(Fig. 1e). The MDAH041 
fibroblasts are p53-null human cells, considered “near”-normal, as they are 
 8 
 
reminiscent of normal diploid cells when p53 is restored, suggesting their downstream 
functions are largely intact.18 
To avoid heterogeneity of p21 expression in bulk cell cultures, we isolated p21-
inducible clones that expressed p21 levels comparable to those observed in vivo and 
in cells exposed to genotoxic agents or p53-independent p21-inducing stimuli (like 
TGF-β)1(Fig. 1e). Apart from monitoring cell proliferation, transcriptome and 
proteome landscapes were examined at distinct time-points (Fig. 1e) after p21 
induction to identify candidate pathways/networks that could over time exercise an 
“oncogenic” effect (Supplementary Tables S2-S9). Representative high-throughput 
results were confirmed independently by quantitative real-time PCR and 
immunoblotting (Fig. 2a, Supplementary Fig. S1ai-ii). As expected,19 the p21-
expressing clones reduced their growth rate and progressively acquired a senescent 
phenotype that peaked around day 10 (Supplementary Fig. S1b, Video S1-S3). 
Consistent with such phenotypical changes, Gene-Ontology biological-process 
enrichment analyses revealed suppression of key “mitosis” factors (Supplementary 
Fig. S1a, Tables S2-S9). Unexpectedly and counter-intuitively, the proteome analysis 
revealed prominent up-regulation of the RLFs: Cdt1, Cdc6 and ORC (p=1.5 x 10-6); 
with Cdt1 protein increase being the earliest biochemical alteration among all 
measured parameters (Supplementary Tables S2-S9). The increase of the RLFs was 
not accompanied by elevated mRNA, implying post-transcriptional regulation (Fig. 
2a). Similar results were observed in the Li-Fraumeni p21-inducible cells (Fig. 2b). 
Notably, p21, Cdt1 and Cdc6 share the same E3 ubiquitin ligase, CRL4CDT2.8,20 
Continuous p21 expression might saturate its enzymatic activity leading to Cdt1 and 
Cdc6 accumulation (Fig. 2c). Consistently, SET8-methyltrasferase a known target of 
CRL4CDT2,21 was up-regulated after p21 induction (Fig. 2c). Shutting-off p21, after a 
 9 
 
period of induction, led to an ubiquitylation-dependent decrease of Cdt1 (Fig. 2d). 
Furthermore, transiently expressed mutant p21PCNA, that avoids p21 degradation by 
CRL4CDT2, did not augment Cdt1 and Cdc6 abundance (Fig. 2e).20 Also, induction of 
wild-type p21, but not the p21PCNA mutant, resulted in Cdt1 and Cdc6 accumulation 
(Fig. 2f). Given that p21 has the strongest affinity amongst all PCNA interacting 
proteins (KD ~2.5 nM)22 these results strongly support a mechanism whereby 
excessive p21 saturates its own ubiquitin ligases allowing accumulation of other 
targets such as Cdt1 and Cdc6. The increase of G1-phase cells caused by p21 
induction likely also contributed to the observed reduced RLF protein turnover, as 
RLFs are normally protected from degradation in G1 (Fig. 2g). Moreover, Cdc6 
accumulation under conditions of blocked protein synthesis was not further enhanced 
upon proteasome inhibition, suggesting reduced protein turnover of Cdc6 (Fig. 2h), 
possibly also due to reduced activity of APCCdh1, another E3 ligase that targets Cdc6 
for degradation.23 Indeed, abundance of Cdh1/Fzr1, the substrate recognition and 
activating component of the APC was decreased (Fig. 2i). Down-regulation of 
Cdh1/Fzr1 contributes to high E2F1 levels (Fig. 2c, Supplementary Fig. S1ci-ii),24,25 
thereby further boosting Cdt1 expression.13 Enhanced Cdc6 stability was associated 
with Cdk2-mediated phosphorylation at Serine 54 (Cdc6-pS54) that protects Cdc6 
from degradation (Fig. 2h).23 Despite p21-mediated Cdk2 activity decrease 
(Supplementary Fig. S1ciii), reduction of Cdh1/Fzr1 appears to tilt the balance in 
favour of Cdc6 accumulation (total and Cdc6-pS54)(Fig. 2h). Notably, protein 
synthesis and proteasome inhibition did not restore Cdh1/Fzr1 protein levels implying 
regulation at the transcriptional level, a notion confirmed experimentally (Fig. 2i). 
Given that most clinical specimens with p21/Ki67-double-positive cells were 
p53-deficient, we examined whether p53 impacts the ability of p21 to regulate the 
 10 
 
Cdt1 and Cdc6 levels, as previously suggested.26 Indeed, p21 expression in p53-
defective and p53-wild-type (wt-p53) cell types resulted in increased (Figs. 2c;3a,d), 
and suppressed (Fig. 3b,c,e) RLF abundance, respectively. It was suggested that p53 
shields the organism from cells undergoing re-replication by triggering apoptosis.26 
Consistently, after p21 induction wt-p53 HT1080 p21-IPTG-ON cells experienced 
massive apoptosis, accompanied by a dramatic decrease of Cdt1 and Cdc6 (Fig. 3e). 
Conversely, silencing of p53 suppressed apoptosis and allowed up-regulation of Cdt1 
and Cdc6 (Fig. 3e). Similar results were obtained upon p53 restoration in the Saos2 
cellular system (Fig. 3c).27 Lastly, exposure to p53-independent p21-inducing stimuli 
such as TGF-β led to up-regulation of both RLFs (Fig. 3d). 
 
Expression of p21 in p53-null cells triggers replication-stress in a Cdt1/Cdc6-
dependent manner  
Re-replication is a form of replication stress driven mainly by inappropriate 
expression of RLFs6,8,9, leading to DNA damage and DNA damage response (DDR) 
activation.6,9 Following p21 induction in both, Saos2 and Li-Fraumeni p21 Tet-ON 
cellular systems, chromatin loading of the MCM2-7 helicase complex increased 
robustly indicating that Cdt1 and Cdc6 up-regulation is functional (Supplementary 
Fig. S1d). Flow cytometry analysis of cells double-stained for DNA content and DNA 
synthesis revealed a cell sub-population with DNA content greater than 4n, indicative 
of re-replication (Fig. 3f-h; Supplementary Video S4). Subsequently, DNA damage, 
assessed by the alkaline comet assay (total number of DNA lesions) and pulsed field 
gel electrophoresis (PFGE) was evident and accompanied by DDR, documented by 
H2AX phosphorylation (γH2AX) and increased 53BP1 foci formation (Fig. 4a-c,d-e; 
Supplementary Fig. S1ei-iv). Strikingly, re-replication, DNA damage DDR 
 11 
 
activation were Cdc6- and Cdt1-dependent, further suggesting that deregulated p21 
causes replication stress associated with re-replication (Fig. 4b,c,d,e). Likewise, 
silencing of p21 alleviated DNA damage and DDR (Supplementary Fig. S1eiii,eiv 
and S2ai-iii). DNA damage reduction was negligible upon dNTPs supplementation, 
in contrast to the impact of Cdt1 and Cdc6 silencing (Fig. 4d).28 Finally, re-replication 
and DNA damage were significantly reduced when the p21PCNA mutant was 
employed, consistent with our model that excess p21 acts by suppressing PCNA-
dependent ubiquitylation of Cdt1 and Cdc6 (Fig. 2f,3h,4f; Supplementary Fig. 
S1ei,eii).8 
It seems paradoxical that p21 could trigger replication stress, given its role as a 
potent cell-cycle inhibitor. Nevertheless, DNA combing showed that replication fork 
progression did not cease, but its speed was reduced (Fig. 4g). In addition, replication 
fork asymmetry was observed, possibly related to the presence of DNA lesions 
impeding bi-directional fork movement (Fig. 4g). Consistently, multi-parameter flow 
cytometry analysis of γH2AX, DNA content and DNA synthesis showed that, 
following p21 induction, DNA damage accumulated mainly in cells incorporating 
EdU, whereas depletion of Cdc6 and Cdt1 profoundly suppressed the accumulation of 
DNA damage in S phase (Fig. 4h,i). Markedly, the cells expressing p21 demonstrated 
a focal PCNA pattern typical for early S phase (Supplementary Fig. S2b),29 
suggesting that DNA damage occurs at a sensitive period when particularly active 
genes and early-replication fragile sites are replicated.30 
 
p21-induced replication intermediates are processed by MUS81-EME1 and 
repaired by a Rad52-dependent mechanism  
 12 
 
To further characterize p21-induced replication stress, we examined single-
stranded DNA (ssDNA) formation, a common intermediate at replication-associated 
lesions. To this end, p21 expressing cells were incubated with BrdU under non-
denaturating conditions, allowing anti-BrdU staining to selectively visualize ssDNA 
regions.31 In situ analysis showed a strong correlation between the native BrdU 
staining and p21 expression (Fig. 5a,b) that was also associated with an increased 
number of foci formed by the ssDNA-binding protein RPA (Fig. 5c). The ssDNA 
could occur either on the template or the newly synthesized (nascent) strand.32-34 
BrdU staining was absent upon short BrdU pulses, suggesting that the source of 
ssDNA is the template strand (Supplementary Fig. S2c). 
Next, we inspected replication intermediates in vivo by an established electron 
microscopy method.35 Compared to wt-p53 U2OS cell line,36 in unperturbed Saos2 
cells we found pronounced accumulation of the so-called reversed forks (Fig. 5di), 
four-way DNA junctions that have been proposed to limit the amount of exposed 
ssDNA and thereby possibly mitigate the detrimental impact of gross replication 
stress.36,37 Expression of p21 in the Saos2 cell model led to a marked accumulation of 
small replication bubbles (Fig. 5dii), decreased fork reversal and enhanced 
accumulation of ssDNA stretches at replication forks, with most small bubbles 
showing one side entirely single-stranded (hemireplicated)(Fig. 5di,5diii). Overall, 
these data are consistent with the notion that p21 expression in p53-defective cancer 
cells deregulates origin firing, leading to accumulation of ssDNA and increased 
replication stress. 
Replication intermediates need to be resolved for replication to restart. After long 
periods of replication inhibition, DSBs generated by the structure-specific resolvase 
complex of MUS81-EME1 are required for replication restart.32,38 We hypothesized 
 13 
 
that sustained p21 expression may phenocopy the latter state. Indeed, MUS81-EME1 
depletion caused a significant DNA damage decrease, inflicted by p21 expression, as 
well as reduction of EdU-positive cells harbouring signs of DNA damage (Fig. 5e-g; 
Supplementary Fig. S2di-ii). MUS81-EME1 is considered a central player in 
oncogene-induced DNA damage response,39,40 promoting homologous recombination 
(HR)-mediated repair of inactivated (collapsed) forks.32 Surprisingly, we noticed that 
silencing of the HR recombinase Rad51 resulted in decreased γH2AX levels (Fig. 
5h). This finding implies a negative control over an alternative, Rad51-indepenent, 
repair process. Rad51 seems to exert such an effect preventing Rad52-dependent 
DNA repair.41 Indeed, suppression of Rad52 was followed by increased γH2AX and 
cell death in both p21-induced models (Fig. 5i,j,k), suggesting that Rad52 guided the 
repair process. Rad52 is possibly involved in error-prone microhomology-mediated 
repair pathways challenging genomic stability.42,43 Interestingly, Rad51 levels were 
reduced upon p21 induction (Fig. 5h; Supplementary Fig. S2diii). Rad51 is in short 
supply and under stressful conditions, such as hypoxia, Rad51 is repressed by 
E2F4/p130 complexes. Such complexes are recruited by p21 to mediate gene 
repression.44 In accordance, the promoter of Rad51 was occupied by E2F4 (Fig. 5l), 
providing an explanation why Rad52 is chosen for repair in this setting. 
 
Deregulated Cdt1 and Cdc6 link p53-independent p21 induction with senescence 
Sustained p53-independent p21 expression triggered senescence, a well 
established antitumor barrier, in a Cdt1- and Cdc6-dependent manner (Fig. 6a,b).14,45 
Consistently, no signs of senescence were observed when the p21PCNA inducible 
mutant was employed or p21 was silenced (Fig 6c, Supplementary Fig. S2ai-iii). As 
p73, the p53 homologue, responds to DDR signaling,46 we asked whether p73 could 
 14 
 
operate downstream in the emerging p21–RLFs–DDR–signalling route. Indeed, p73 
proved to be required for the p21-Cdt1/Cdc6-induced senescence (Fig. 6d,e). 
According to the oncogene-induced DNA damage concept for cancer 
development, the DDR-mediated anti-tumour barriers are breached at some point in 
tumours that progress, accompanied by genomic instability.12 If this concept is 
applicable for chronic p53-independent p21 induction, then in due time the p21 
expressing cells could bypass the senescence barrier generating more aggressive 
outgrowing clones. Cdc6 overexpression per se could contribute to senescence bypass 
by repressing the INK4/ARF locus,47 encoding p16INK4A, an indispensible factor of 
irreversible senescence.48 Indeed, p21 activation led to down-regulation of both 
INK4/ARF products, p16INK4A and p14ARF, undermining the durability of p21-
mediated senescence (Fig. 6f,g). 
 
Senescence bypass, genomic instability and enhanced aggressiveness under 
protracted p21 expression  
After 10 days of p21 induction in p53-deficient models the senescent phenotype 
gradually declined and a sub-population of proliferating p21-positive cells emerged 
(Fig. 7a-e; Supplementary Video S5). Likewise the mutually exclusive expression 
pattern of cyclin A-an established late S/G2 marker-49,50 and p21 was reduced and 
replaced by a p21/cyclin A double-positive cell sub-population (Fig. 7f). It appears 
that a fraction of p21 expressing cells evaded arrest/senescence, re-entering the cell 
cycle (“escaped cells”). Cdk2 activity and its stimulatory phosphorylation (p-T160) 
were concomitantly restored (Fig. 7g; Supplementary Fig. S2ei). Notably, p21 
expression in the “escaped” cells was similar to, or even higher than, that observed in 
 15 
 
the initial phase of p21 induction, excluding the possibility that low p21 
stoichiometric concentrations drive proliferation (Fig. 7g; Supplementary Fig. S2eii-
iii).1 The “escaped” cells showed a dramatic reduction of p73 expression (Fig. 7g,h). 
There was no evidence of genetic or epigenetic inactivation of the p73 locus but 
instead downregulation of EGR1, the main transcriptional activator of TP73 
(Supplementary Figs. S2f,S3-5).51 The nuclei in most “escaped” cells were larger 
than those in the cycling control cells (Fig. 7i, Supplementary Video S5), a feature 
noticed also in vivo (Fig. 1,7j; Supplementary Fig. S2g). Noticeably, in vivo, the 
cells displaying Ki67/p21 coexpression were also Cdc6 and/or Cdt1 positive (Fig 7j; 
Supplementary Fig. S2g). DNA damage was also reduced in the “escaped” cells 
implying that a repair process took place (Fig. 7k). The involvement of the MUS81-
EME1 - Rad52 repair route (Fig. 5e-k) and the increased presence of micronuclei 
(Fig. 8a) that are considered surrogate markers of chromosomal instability, defective 
DDR and repair,52 indicated, that such repair was error-prone. To gain a genome-wide 
view of this emerging scenario we performed aCGH, deep sequencing and 
M/FISH/SKY comparing the “escaped” and the un-induced cells (Fig. 8; 
Supplementary Fig. S4-6, Tables S10-S12). Cumulatively, the results from six 
independent biological replicates employing all three experimental procedures 
showed that the genomic landscape of the “escaped” cells acquired chromosomal 
aberrations, in the form of gains and losses (Fig. 8b,c; Supplementary Fig. S4a-
c,S5,S6, Tables S10-S12), as well as novel translocations (Fig. 8d,e,f; 
Supplementary Fig. S4c, Table S13-S15). Notably, high frequency of 
microhomologies (≥ 2 nucleotides)42 was identified adjacent to the novel breakpoints 
in both systems, favoring a role of microhomology-mediated repair in p21-driven 
genomic instability (Figure 8d,e; Supplementary Fig. S7, Table S16). Interestingly 
 16 
 
among the genetic lesions found were alterations reminiscent of chromoanasynthesis 
or chromothripsis (Fig. 8b,c; Supplementary Table S10,S11).53 Given that the 
multifaceted chromosomal assessment showed concordant results (Fig. 8d-g; 
Supplementary Fig. S4-S6) and each experimental procedure took place at different 
time periods, we propose that p21 may steer a “deterministic” set of genetic events 
that may play a role in the behavior of the “escaped” cells. In line with this notion the 
transcriptome of the “escaped” cells (Supplementary Fig. S3,S8) demonstrated a 
specific non-random correlation with the genomic alterations found in these cells 
(p<2.2*10-16 for the Saos2 and p=0.0013 for the Li-Fraumeni cells). Deregulation of 
the replication licensing machinery was the earliest biochemical event observed upon 
p21 induction, further suggesting that genomic instability “drove” the alterations in 
transcriptome landscapes of the “escaped” cells. While p21 is not a transcription 
factor it can modulate transcription in certain cases.54 However, the fact that only 42 
(7.6%) of the 553 genes and 538 (15%) of the 3507 genes found differentially 
expressed in the “escaped” Saos2 and Li-Fraumeni p21 Tet-ON cells, respectively, 
were detected in earlier time-points makes the latter scenario of more ‘direct’ 
transcriptional effects of p21 most unlikely (Supplementary Fig. S8). 
Importantly the “escaped” clones demonstrated enhanced anchorage-independent 
growth and were more invasive (Fig. 8h,i,l). Furthermore, they tolerated treatment 
with genotoxic drugs doxorubicin and cisplatin much more efficiently, yet showed no 
significant difference in the response to taxol, a microtubule polymer stabilizer. The 
enhanced resistance to doxorubicin and cisplatin persisted even when p21 was 
switched off in the “escaped” cells for 10 days, documenting that this feature was a 
durable consequence, independent of any potential p21-mediated transient 
 17 
 
transcriptional effect (Fig. 8j,m). This chemoresistance effect was absent when p21 
was silenced very early after p21 induction (Supplementary Fig. S2ai-iii). A number 
of the transcriptionally altered genes connected with aggressive behaviour could help 
interpret the acquired aggressive phenotypic features (Supplementary Fig. S3d,e, 
Table S17-S22). Furthermore, assessments of tumor-sphere formation and anchorage 
independent growth indicated that the “escaped” populations are enriched in cells 
with “stemness”-like features (Fig. 8k, Supplementary Fig. S3d).

DISCUSSION  
The present dataset demonstrates an unexpected p21-mediated oncogenic 
mechanism that is distinct from that reported for leukemia stem-cells.55 It also 
explains why p21 is only transiently expressed during induction of senescence48,56 and 
how p53 inactivation can tip the balance towards the p21’s oncogenic function.  
When free from influence of wt-p53, p21 induced by p53-independent signals 
causes deregulation of the replication licensing machinery triggering replication 
stress. We provide evidence that continuous production of p21 suppresses its 
degradation module, CRL4CDT2, possibly by oversaturating it as p21 has the strongest 
PCNA-binding affinity (Supplementary Fig. 8c),22 thereby leaving their other 
targets, including Cdt1, Cdc6 and E2F1 unabated to perform their functions 
(Supplementary Fig. 8c). Since Cdt1 expression is positively regulated by E2F1,13 
such feed-forward mechanism could further boost Cdt1 expression (Supplementary 
Fig. 8c). Although CRL4CDT2 seems to be the key player in this process, SCFSkp2 
which also targets p21 and Cdt1 may also contribute.1,22,57  
By up-regulating the pivotal replication licensing factors Cdt1 and Cdc6, the cells 
expressing p21 acquire the capacity to re-replicate (or “endo-reduplicate)”, a 
phenomenon that we now explain mechanistically.58 We show that p21-mediated 
genome re-replication eventually drives a chromosome-destabilizing process giving 
rise to descendant cells with more aggressive cancerous features (Supplementary 
Fig. 8c). Re-replication is a form of replication stress that leads to replication fork 
stalling, collapse, DNA damage and eventually genomic instability.8,9,59 Within this 
context, the p53 checkpoint was shown to limit re-replication, via eliminating re-
replicating cells by apoptosis (Fig. 3b).26 The fact that the turn-over of p21, Cdt1 and 
Cdc6 is controlled by the same E3-ubiquitin ligase, CRL4CDT2, underscores the 
 19 
 
significance of p53 whose inactivation abolishes a cell-protective mechanism. Given 
that p21 mutations are extremely rare events in cancer,1,5 it is apparent that human 
cancers with mutant p53 are at risk of suffering additional deleterious, tumour 
heterogeneity-promoting genetic alterations by protracted operation of p21, induced 
through p53-independent signals (Supplementary Fig. 1eiii-iv).1  
The ensuing involvement of MUS81-EME1 and the recombinase Rad52 point 
towards a replication-based error-prone DNA repair process.39,40 Reduction of Rad51 
elicits a switch from high-fidelity homologous recombination to a lower-fidelity 
repair process mediated by Rad52 that requires much less homology (micro-
homology)(Supplementary Fig. 8c).41,42,60 The altered genomic landscape and the 
high frequency of micro-homologies found within and adjacent to the mapped 
breakpoints supports the latter scenario (Supplementary Fig. S4-7). Among the 
chromosomal aberrations observed, chromoanasynthesis results from replicative 
template-switching events (Fig. 8b,c).61 However, chromothripsis, another complex 
chromosomal rearrangement pattern noticed here (Fig. 8b,c), is considered to be the 
outcome of NHEJ,62 implying that other repair pathways, possibly non-replicative 
ones, may also contribute to the p21–driven genomic instability.  
A question that always emerges is whether genomic alterations represent a 
passenger or a driver event. The strong correlation between the transcriptome and 
genome changes supports the latter possibility. Among the transcripts found deranged 
were growth factors and metalloproteinases that could account for the aggressive 
behavior of the “escaped” cells (Supplementary Fig. S3; Table S17-S22). Notably, 
ID1 shown to antagonize the suppressive effects of p16INK4A and p21,63 was up-
regulated in the “escaped” cells (Supplementary Fig. S3).  
 20 
 
Collectively, p21-driven genomic instability constitutes part of a selection 
trajectory to promote survival and long-term cancer evolution,64 as illustrated mainly 
by the increased aggressiveness and resistance of the “escaped” cells to genotoxic 
agents. This tumour evolutionary scenario involves a combination of p53 defects 
permissible for passage through a reversible senescence phase (Fig. 6f,g)48,57 that 
“conceals” an underlying replication stress-based/error-prone repair route that over 
time ensures that the “fittest and more adapted cancer cells” emerge.10 Our results 
highlight the “dark side” of p21 that should be taken into consideration when 
designing therapeutic strategies, particularly for p53-deficient tumours, as agents used 
in clinical oncology, such as dexamethazone, can induce p21 in a p53-independent 
manner with potential detrimental effects to patients.65

(e) Sustained expression of p21WAF1/Cip1 in cells with non-functional p53 leads to

revealed potential factors that regulate p73 expression and activity. EGR-1 (Early Growth 
Response-1) is a potent transcriptional up-regulator of p73.51 In turn, p73 can also 
transcriptionally induce EGR-1exprresion, forming a positive feed-back loop. HECW2 
(ΗECT, C2 αnd WW Domain Containing E3 Ubiquitin Protein Ligase 2) expression 
stabilizes p73 protein levels via mono-ubiquitination,75 while PRKACB (Protein Kinase 
 A Catalytic Subunit β) decreases p73 transactivation and intramolecular interaction 
capacity.76 iii. TP73 gene locus organization and structure of p73 protein with HECW2

of EGR-1 at mRNA and protein level in “escaped” Li-Fraumeni p21WAF1/Cip1 cells (n=3 
experiments). vii. Potential mechanism for p73 downregulation in “escaped” cells. 
Decreased levels of EGR-1 possibly represent the main reason for low p73 expression.49 
Additionally, high levels of PRKACB decreases p73 transactivation and intramolecular 
interaction abilities,76 counteracting the ability of high HECW2 expression to stabilize 
p73 via mono-ubiquitination.75 High PRKACB levels may contribute further to p73 
down-regulation by interfering with the positive feed-back loop between ERG-1 and 
p73.76 (g) Serial-section immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis showed co-expression of 
p21WAF1/Cip1, Ki67 and Cdc6/Cdt1 in atypical cancer cells in head and neck carcinomas,

Suppl. Figure 4. “Escaped” Saos2 p21WAF1/Cip1 cells exhibit increased genomic 
instability relative to non-induced cells. (a) Timeline of experimental planning of 
genomic analyses. (b) Overview of all array-CGH (aCGH) analyses results. In total 41 
aberrations were found involving all chromosomes (except 9, 12, 14 and 15). The 
 aberrations included 19 gains and 22 losses (Supplemental Table 5). The majority of 
aberrations were concentrated in chromosomes 3, 10 and X (Supplemental Table 5). 
[reference (Ref) genome is from un-induced (0 d) Saos2 p21WAF1/Cip1 cells] (c) Novel 
clonal rearrangements distinguish the “escaped” Saos2 p21WAF1/Cip1 (ON) from OFF cells 
[arrows indicate lost (in OFF cells) or rearranged (in “escaped”-ON cells) chromosomes]. 
The p21WAF1/Cip1-OFF cells (control), were mainly hypotriploid (51-56 chromosomes) 
and shared most of the characteristic structural chromosome aberrations of the parental 
Saos2 cell line.77 Compared to these cells, the “escaped” ones remained hypo-triploid but 
displayed at least 10 novel clonal structural or numerical aberrations affecting 
chromosomes 2, 3, 5, 8, 11, 13, 14, 20, 21 and X. Large portions of chromosomes X and 
13 were lost in 90% of the “escaped” cells, confirming the aCGH findings. Furthermore, 
differential imbalances of chromosomes 5 and X between Saos2 p21WAF1/Cip1 ON cells 
and the controls were observed. In “escaped” (ON) cells, an additional inverted 
duplication of 5p was also present in 90% of the examined nuclei. (d) The Saos2 
p21WAF1/Cip1 ON cells exert significantly higher rates (two fold) of random structural 
CIN/chromosome as compared to controls. (CIN:chromosomal instability) (e) Genomic 
distribution of breakpoints of random structural chromosome anomalies. Telomeric 
regions were found to be most frequently affected by fusions, translocations and tandem 
duplications of large chromosome segments. As unidentified ones were categorized the 
non-telomeric, non centromeric genomic rearrangements in which the cytogenetic bands 
of their breakpoints remained obscure. (f) “Escaped” Saos2 p21WAF1/Cip1 cells exhibit 
increased karyotypic aberrations relative to non-induced cells. Comparative pseudo-
colored M-FISH/SKY karyograms of 10 non-induced (OFF) Saos2 p21WAF1/Cip1 cells 
 (588 chromosomes) and 10 “escaped” (ON) ones (639 chromosomes), for the evaluation 
of whole genome structural CIN at the 350 chromosome band level. Arrows (and dashed 
rectangles) indicate representative non-clonal random structural rearrangements (unique 
anomalies encountered in a single cell). The “escaped” p21WAF1/Cip1 expressing cells (ON) 
displayed significantly higher rates of genome wide, random structural chromosomal 
rearrangements. ON cells (upper panel): Cells #1 and #7, from the Saos2 p21WAF1/Cip1 
OFF panel, represent a minor subclone (20%) of this population because they share a 
distinctive clonal rearrangement affecting a derivative chromosome X and a deletion of 
12p. Cells #3 and #5, belong to a second subclone of the control cells that is characterized 
by a deletion of a rearranged chromosome 19. The remaining non-induced (OFF) 
p21WAF1/Cip1 cells #2, #4, #6, #8 and #10, display a homogeneous karyotypic constitution 
and represent the major clone. Cell #9 is a polyploid product of whole genome 
endoreduplication of the major clone of Saos2 p21WAF1/Cip1 OFF cells. “Escaped”-OFF 
cells (lower panel): Cells #1 and #6 differ from the majority of the “escaped” (ON) 
population as they share a clonal inverted duplication of the long arm of chromosome 21. 
In addition, cells #2, #4 and #9, have lost a marker translocation der(9)t(5;9) that was 
replaced by a deletion 9p and acquired clonally an extra translocated der(22)t(20;22). A 
unique subclonal finding in Cells #3 and #10, of the “escaped” (ON) cells is the 
persistence of der(9)t(5;9). Cells #5 and #7 represent two different endoreduplicated ON 
subclones, characterized by unique structural abnormalities of chromosomes 7, 15 and 6

population and justifies the presence of an additional subclone that does not exceed the 
10% of the “escaped” (ON) cells. (CIN:chromosomal instability)

“escaped” cells in relation to OFF (553 genes). The correlogram at the bottom illustrates 
the absence of correlation between the “escaped” population with the three early time 
points (12, 48, 96hs). C: Relative expression of commonly differentially expressed genes

ONLINE MATERIALS and METHODS 
Tumour specimens 
Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections from 20 head-neck carcinomas, 30 
urothelial bladder carcinomas, 30 lung carcinomas and 5 dysplasia-associated lesions 
or masses (DALMs) from patients with ulcerative colitis, that exhibit early p53 
aberrations,17 were analyzed after local ethical committee approval and have been 
previously described.14,67 Patients had not undergone any chemo-, immune- or 
radiotherapy.  
 
Cell lines and culture treatments 
Cell lines were maintained in DMEM (Invitrogen) with 10% FCS (Invitrogen), 2mM 
l-glutamine (Invitrogen), and 100µg/ml penicillin and streptomycin (Invitrogen) at 
37°C and 5% CO2.  
p21WAF1 and p21PCNA were subcloned from pRc-CMV vectors into the pLVXTRE3G, 
correspondingly. Inducible Li-Fraumeni p21WAF1/Cip1 Tet-ON, Li-Fraumeni and Saos2 
p21PCNA Tet-ON cells were generated by introducing the p21WAF1- and the p21PCNA-
carrying pLVXTRE3G vectors in MDAH041 (Li-Fraumeni) fibroblasts and Saos2, 
respectively.18 Clones with clear p21WAF1 and p21PCNA expression were selected. 
Tet-ON inducible cell lines were treated with 1µg/ml Doxycycline (Applichem) and 
HT1080 p21WAF1-9 cells with 100µM IPTG (Ambion). Saos2 and MDA-MD-234 
were treated with 5ng/ml TGF-β, while MCF cells with 2µM doxorubicin (Sigma). 
Microphotographs were obtained with an inverted microscope (Axiovert S100; Carl 
Zeiss) equipped with CP-Achromat objectives and a charge-coupled device IRIS 
 2 
 
colour video camera (SSC-C370P; Sony), using Image Pro Plus v3.0 (Media 
Cybernetics) software. 
No cell lines used in this study were found in the database of commonly misidentified 
cell lines that is maintained by ICLAC and NCBI Biosample. All cell lines have been 
authenticated by STR profiling and are regularly tested to exclude mycoplasma 
contamination. 
 
siRNA transfections and retrovirus infections 
Cdc6, Cdt1, Rad52, Rad51, p21WAF1, CDH1/FZR-1 (Thermo Scientific) and Mus81, 
p73 (Santa Cruz) siRNA gene silencing was performed as described, following 
manufacturer’s instructions.46  
Saos2 cells were transiently infected with pMSCV, pMSCV-p21WAF1 or pMSCV-
p21PCNA (a mutant p21WAF1 harboring Q144, M147, F150 substitutions to A in its PIP 
degron motif) vectors using the Phoenix helper-free retrovirus producer cell line as 
previously described.49 
 
Immunohistochemistry (IHC) 
IHC was performed as previously published using the UltraVision LP Detection 
System (#TL-060-HD, Thermo Scientific) according to manufacturer’s instructions.67 
Primary antibodies are described in Supplementary Table S23. Evaluation and 
controls for Ki-67 and p21WAF1 have been previously described.67 
 
Indirect Immunofluorescence (IF) 
 3 
 
Indirect IF analysis was performed as previously published.14 Primary antibodies are 
described in Supplementary Table S23. Secondary antibodies were Alexa Fluor® 
488 goat anti-rabbit (Invitrogen, #A11034, 1:500) and Alexa Fluor® 568 goat anti-
mouse (Invitrogen, #A110-31, 1:500). Image acquisition of multiple random fields 
was automated on a ScanR screening station (Olympus, Germany) and analyzed with 
ScanR (Olympus, Germany) software, or a Zeiss Axiolab fluorescence microscope 
equipped with a Zeiss Axiocam MRm camera and Achroplan objectives, while image 
acquisition was performed with AxioVision software 4.7.1. 
 
Electron microscopy (EM) analysis of DNA RIs in human cells 
The procedure was performed as previously described.35 Images were obtained with a 
transmission electron microscope (Tecnai G2 Spirit; FEI; LaB6 filament; high tension 
≤120 kV) equipped with a side mount charge coupled device camera (2,600×4,000 
pixels; Orius 1000; Gatan, Inc), processed with DigitalMicrograph Version 1.83.842 
(Gatan, Inc.) and analyzed with Image J (National Institutes of Health). 
 
Protein extraction, cell fractionation and immunoblotting 
Protein extraction and cell fractionation (Supplementary Fig. S1di) was performed 
as described before.12,14 Primary antibodies are described in Supplementary Table 
S23. Thirty µg of protein from total extracts or 1µg of histones per sample, were 
adjusted with Laemmli Buffer (Sigma) and loaded on acrylamide/bis-acrylamide gels. 
Gel electrophoresis, transfer to PVDF membrane (Millipore) and signal development 
with nitro blue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolylphosphate (NBT/BCIP) 
solution (Molecular Probes) or chemiluminescence were performed as previously 
 4 
 
described.12 Alkaline phosphatase conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit secondary 
antibody (1:5000 dilution)(Promega) were used.  
 
In vivo ubiquitin assay 
Saos2 p21WAF1 cells were treated with MG-132 proteasome inhibitor (MERCK) for 
3h at 30µM at the time points indicated (Fig. 2d). Cells were lysed in RIPA buffer 
[50mM Tris-HCL pH 8.0, 150mM NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 1% Sodium Deoxycholate, 1% 
Triton X-100, protease inhibitor cocktail (Thermo Scientific), phosphatase inhibitor 
cocktail 
(Thermo 
Scientific), 
N-ethylameleimide 
deubiquitinase 
inhibitor 
(Applichem)]. Protein lysates were precleared with protein G agarose beads 
(Millipore) for 1hr and then incubated with G-protein beads bound to Cdt1 antibody 
(Supplementary Table S23) for 2 hours at 4oC. Beads were washed 3 times in RIPA 
buffer containing protease, phosphatase and deubiquitinase inhibitors, as above. 
Protein was eluted from beads with 2x SDS-β-mercaptoethanol sample buffer, boiled 
for 8 min and loaded on polyacrylamide gels for SDS-PAGE as described above. 
Blots were blocked for 1h in 5% BSA in TBS-0.1% (v/v) Tween-20 solution at room 
temperature (RT). Membranes were incubated overnight with Cdt1 antibody 
(Supplementary Table S23) in 5% BSA in TBS supplemented with 0.1% (v/v) 
Tween-20, followed by a 1h incubation with HRP- conjugated anti-mouse secondary 
antibody (R&D Systems) at 1:1.000 dilution at RT. Signal development was 
performed with NBT/BCIP solution (Molecular Probes) according to manufacturer’s 
instructions. 
 
CDK2 kinase activity 
 5 
 
For each sample, 50mg of total-cell protein extract was precleared for 2h at 4°C with 
5mg of rabbit immunoglobulin G (anti-Cdk2) or 5mg of mouse immunoglobulin G 
(anti-cyclin B1) prebound to protein A-Sepharose (Upstate-Millipore). Precleared 
lysates were collected and incubated with anti-Cdk2, or anti-cyclin B1with mixing for 
2h at 4°C. Protein A-Sepharose was added, and the samples were mixed for 2h at 4°C. 
The immunoprecipitates were washed twice with TBS and twice with kinase buffer 
(100mM Tris [pH 7.4], 20mM MgCl2, 2mM dithiothreitol) and incubated with 5mg 
of histone H1 (Boehringer Mannheim), 15nM ATP for 10min at 25°C. Samples were 
incubated with Malachite Green Reagent for 30min (Cdk2 and cyclin B1). Kinase 
assay mixtures were quantified at 620nm by subtracting negative control. 
 
Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay 
ChIP assay was performed as previously described.12 A 100bp fragment in the Rad51 
promoter and a 110bp amplicon, located approximately 1000bp from the transcription 
start site (Fig. 5l), were amplified. Primers and annealing temperatures are provided 
in Supplemental Table S24. PCR reactions containing 1% of the total chromatin 
extract used in the immunoprecipitation reactions were used as inputs. 
 
Comet Assay  
Was performed as previously described.12 Cells were observed under a Zeiss Axiolab 
fluorescence microscope equipped with a monochrome CCD camera. Analysis was 
conducted with Cometscore software (Tritek). All experiments were performed in 
triplicates. 
 
 6 
 
Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) 
Has been previously described.31  
 
DNA fiber spreadings 
Was conducted as previously described with slight modifications.45 Briefly, Saos2 
p21WAF1/ cells were grown in the presence or absence of doxycyclin for 4 days and 
then pulsed-labeled with 25µM CldU for 20min, and then labelled with 250µM IdU 
for 20min. Cells were then harvested and lysed on glass slides in spreading buffer. 
The DNA was denatured and stained with rat anti-BrdU/CldU (1:1000, OBT0030F, 
Immunologicals Direct) and mouse anti-IdU/BrdU (1:500, clone B44, Becton 
Dickinson) primary antibodies.  
 
Isolation of nucleic acids and bisulfate treatment 
DNA extraction was performed as previously described.14 RNA was extracted with 
the RNeasy Mini Kit (#74104, Qiagen). For assessing DNA methylation levels of p73 
promoter, 1 µg DNA was bisulphite-converted using the EZ-DNA Methylation Gold 
kit (ZymoResearch) as per supplier’s guidelines and eluted in 30 µl of elution buffer. 
 
cDNA preparation and real time (RT)-PCR 
cDNA generation and real-time reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) analysis was run 
as described before.67 DNA methylation levels for p73-promoter were assessed by 
high-resolution-melting (HRM) analysis. The reaction was performed in a StepOne 
Real time machine (Life Technologies) using Universal Master Mix II w/o UNG 
containing SYBR (Life Technologies) and 200nM primers. A dissociation (melt) 
 7 
 
curve programme followed at the end of 40 cycles. Signal analysis was carried out 
using the StepOne v2.3 software. SssI methylated and unmethylated DNA was run in 
parallel as positive and negative controls, respectively. Primer sequences and 
annealing temperatures are provided in Supplemental Table S24. Results are 
presented as n-fold changes for the various time points after p21WAF1 induction versus 
the values of the non-induced sample. Mean value was calculated from three 
independent measurements. 
 
Flow cytometric analysis (FACS) 
Cell cycle analysis was assessed on a FACS Calibur (Becton-Dickinson) as described 
before.14 
For BrdU pulse-chase proliferation assays, cells were pulse-labeled with 10µM BrdU 
(Roche) for 1h, fixed in 70% ethanol, and incubated in 2M HCl for 30min. Cells were 
incubated with mouse antibody against BrdU (1:100) for 1h. For EdU analysis, cells 
were either pulsed for 10min or 24h with 10µM EdU. Cells were fixed in 70% ethanol 
and incubated with mouse anti–γ-H2AX (1:100, Millipore) or mouse anti-p21WAF1 
(1:100, SantaCruz) for 30 min, followed by further 15 min incubation with Alexa 
Fluor 488 anti–mouse IgG (1:100, Invitrogen) or anti-mouse E-Phycoerythrin (1:100, 
Invitrogen). EdU was detected with a Click-iT EdU Cell Proliferation Assay kit 
(Invitrogen).  
For MCM2 staining, cells were washed once in wash buffer (1% (w/v) BSA in PBS), 
while unbound MCM2-7 was extracted in freshly prepared CSK buffer (10mM 
HEPES, 100mM NaCl, 3mM MgCl2, 1mM EGTA, 300mM sucrose, 1% (w/v) BSA, 
0.2% (w/v) Triton-X100, 1mM DTT, 1mM PMSF, 10ng/ml Pepstatin, 10ng/ml 
 8 
 
Leupeptin and 10ng/ml Aprotinin) on ice for 10min. Extracted cells were then fixed in 
2% (v/v) paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10min at 37°C, washed twice in wash buffer 
and stored in wash buffer at 4°C until staining. CSK extracted fixed cells were 
permeabilised in ice cold 70% (v/v) ethanol for 10min at RT, washed in wash buffer 
and incubated for 1h at RT with mouse monoclonal anti-human MCM2 (BM28 
#610700, BD Biosciences) diluted 1:500 in wash buffer. Cells were then washed once 
in wash buffer and incubated for 30min at RT in the dark with Alexa Fluor 488 goat 
anti-mouse secondary antibody (#A-11029, Life Technologies) diluted 1:500 in wash 
buffer, before being washed twice in wash buffer and re-suspended in 50µg/ml 7-
AAD (7-aminoactinomycin D, Life Technologies) diluted in wash buffer. Samples 
were analysed using FACS Canto (Becton Dickinson) and the BD FACS DIVA 
software (BD Biosciences). Data analysis was performed using Flowjo (version 7.6.5, 
Tree Star Inc.). To quantify G1 MCM levels, the Flowjo software was used to gate on 
cells with a G1 DNA content and then the mean, median, 95th and 99th percentiles of 
the Alexa Fluor 488 levels in the G1 cells were calculated for each replicate; the data 
is presented with the background mean, median, 95th percentile or 99th percentile 
subtracted to correct for the increase in auto-fluorescence. 
 
Senescence staining 
Control (OFF) and induced (ON) Saos2 p21WAF1 Tet-ON or MDAH041 p21WAF1 Tet-
ON cells were fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde and then processed for Sa-β-gal or 
Sudan Black B staining and counterstained with nuclear fast red, as described 
elsewhere.66 Only cytoplasmic staining was scored as positive signal.

[serum-free DMEM/F12 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 20ng/ml epidermal 
growth factor (EGF, Sigma), 20ng/ml basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF, Sigma) 
and 1×B27 supplement (Invitrogen)] in ultra-low attachment 6-well plates (Corning). 
Cells were cultured under 5% CO2 at 37°C for 15 days. Number of generated spheres 
were counted and sized under an inverted microscope (Axiovert S100; Carl Zeiss) 
equipped with CP-Achromat objectives. Subsequently, medium with spheres were 
aspirated, treated with trypsin to dissociate cells from spheres and centrifuged (Fig. 
8k). Cell pellets were resuspended in fresh medium, counted and plated on soft agar, 
as previously described.12 Data from three independent measurements from this 
combined procedure were averaged and corresponding s.d. is reported. 
 
Molecular Cytogenetics

Molecular cytogenetics analyses were conducted as previously reported.12 
Cytogenetic analyses were performed using a 63× magnification lens on a fluorescent 
Axio-Imager Z1, Zeiss microscope, equipped with a MetaSystems charge-coupled 
device (CCD) camera and the MetaSystems Isis software. 
 
High-throughput analyses  
Proteomics  
Total protein was extracted from 2 biological replicates of non-induced and 12h, 48h 
and 96h induced Saos2-p21WAF1 Tet-ON cells (n=2 epxeriments), where protein 
Digestion and 8plex-iTRAQ Labeling was performed as previously described.16 The 
pooled whole sample was split in two equal parts lyophilized and stored at -20oC. To 
the first half of the aforementioned iTRAQ labeled sample High-pH Reverse Phase 
(RP) Peptide Fractionation was performed as previously described.16 The second half 
of the iTRAQ labeled peptides was fractionated with Hydrophilic Interaction 
Chromatography as previously described.68 
The individual high-pH RP and HILIC peptide fractions were analysed by LC-
MS/MS followed by database searching as previously described.69 
 
High-throughput whole genome analyses

induced, each comprising 2 biological replicates, (n=2)] and 1x1MK [to analyze i. 
Saos2-p21WAF1 escaped and non-induced, each comprising 2 biological replicates, 
(n=2) and ii. Li-Fraumeni-p21WAF1 escaped and non-induced, each comprising 3 
biological replicates, (n=3)] microarrays were used. Labelling and hybridization was 
carried out according to manufacturer’s guidelines. Data were processed using 
Feature Extraction 10.7.3.1 and analysed using Cytogenomics 2.7.22.0 software 
(Agilent) with the following settings: Algorithm: ADM-1, Threshold: 6.7, with a 
minimum of 4 probes for a region to be included. Centralization and fuzzy zero 
corrections were applied to remove putative variant intervals with small average log2 
ratios as compared to the noise-level which was determined by the system.  
Whole genome sequencing (WGS). Genomic DNA from two biological replicates 
(n=2) obtained at 30 days induction and non-induction of Saos2- and Li-Fraumeni-
p21WAF1 Tet-ON cells, respectively, was used for WGS. The library preparation and 
the WGS were carried out in the Greek Genome Center (GGC) of Biomedical 
Research Foundation of Academy of Athens (BRFAA) and in EMBL Genecore 
facility. 
WGS was performed achieving 20-30x coverage of the human genome with paired-
end sequencing (2x150 and 2x100 bp). Quality control was performed with fastqc 
software70 and alignment to the human genome (GRCh37/hg19 version) was 
performed with bowtie2 algorithm.71 Samtools72 was used to convert sam files to bam 
and for sorting bam files. Breakdancer software73 (breakdancer-1.1-2011_02_21 
version) was utilized in order to identify SV (intra- and inter-chromosomal 
translocations, deletions, insertions and inversions).  
 12 
 
Use of breakdancer with default parameters led to identification of new inter-
chromosomal translocations in “ON” versus “OFF” cells in both cell types 
(Supplementary Fig. S7). In order to identify microhomology regions in the inter-
chromosomal translocations observed in both systems we used the coordinates from 
the breakdancer output and extended 30bp on both sides of the breakpoint-junction. 
Clustal W was used for aligning the regions around the breakpoint junctions. 
Microhomology regions identified on the breakpoint spanned from 2-38bp. 
RNA-seq analysis. RNA was collected from non-induced, 10 days (10d) and 
“escaped” Li-Fraumeni p21WAF1/Cip1 Tet-ON cells [six biological replicates for 
escaped (n=6) and four biological replicates for non-induced (n=4)]. RNA-seq library 
preparation and analysis procedure was performed as described before.8 
Expression microarray analysis. Total RNA was isolated from three biological 
replicates of non-induced and 12h, 48h and 96h induced Saos2-p21WAF1 Tet-ON cells 
(n=3), using RNeasy Total RNA kit (Qiagen) following the manufactures instructions. 
Microarray analysis was performed by the microarray unit of CBM Core Facility Italy 
(http://www.cbm.fvg.it) using Illumina’s Whole-Genome Expression Beadchip. 
Integrity of total RNA was evaluated using capillary electrophoresis (Bioanalyzer 
2100, Agilent) and quantified using a Nanodrop 1000. Aliquots of RNA (250 ng) 
samples were amplified according to specifications of the Illumina® TotalPrep™ 
RNA Amplification Kit (Ambion) to produce a pool of biotin-labeled RNA 
corresponding to the polyadenylated (mRNA) fraction. The cRNA samples were 
applied to whole-genome HumanHT-12 v4.0 arrays (Illumina) and hybridized 
according to manufacturer’s specification. The hybridization images signal intensities 
were extracted and background subtracted using Illumina Inc. BeadStudio (v3.3.7). 
Data were checked for the Illumina internal quality control. 
 13 
 
Total RNA was extracted from the non-induced and “escaped” Saos2-p21WAF1 Tet-
ON cells using Trizol (Life Technologies) and choloroform/isoamyl alcohol (49:1) 
[four biological replicates for escaped (n=4) and three biological replicates for non-
induced (n=3)]. Targets were prepared using the GeneChip Whole Transcriptome 
(WT) Plus reagent kit and hybridized to Affymetrix GeneChip Human Transcriptome 
array 2.0 (HTA 2.0). The obtained Saos2-p21WAF1 transcriptome profile was 
compared with the Li-Fraumeni p21WAF1 transcriptome profile obtained by RNA-seq. 
 
Bioinformatic analysis 
Transcriptome and Proteome analyses from non-induced, 12h, 48h and 96h induced 
Saos2-p21WAF1 Tet-ON cells. Protein and gene ratios (time-point/time-0) were log(2) 
transformed and centered. Statistically significant differentially expressed genes and 
proteins (p<0.05) where determined by the log-2 ratios normal distributions and 
ANOVA plus Kruskal-Wallis (Kruskal Wallis only for the transcriptome data-set 
where n=3) since there were more than one time-points. All calculations were 
performed with R. The “Gene-Set Enrichment Analysis” on the Gene-Ontology 
Biological-Process set was performed as previously described.16 Pathway 
visualization for all data-sets was performed with Ariadne Genomics Pathway Studio 
v9.0. Proteomics dataset were deposited at ProteomeXchange Consortium via the 
PRIDE partner repository with the dataset identifier PXD001289. 
Transcriptome analysis from non-induced and “escaped” Saos2-p21WAF1 Tet-ON 
cells. Affymetrix .CEL files were normalized with the Robust Multi-array Average 
(RMA) algorithm. Data were further analyzed by Principal Component Analysis and 
one-way ANOVA (p<0.05). Differentially expressed transcripts were analyzed using 
 14 
 
the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software considering all direct and indirect 
relationships obtained only from experimentally verified information.  
WGS and aCGH data comparison. To compare the WGS data with the aCGH one 
regarding DNA copy number aberrations in “escaped” (ON) cells versus control 
(OFF) cells (both in Saos2 and Li-Fraumeni systems), the WGS data were processed 
as follows: a) Genomic regions presenting less than 10-times coverage were filtered 
out to ensure data high-quality, b) The log2 of the ratio of the normalized reads in the 
“escaped” cells  over the normalized number of reads in the control-cells was 
calculated, c) For each chromosome the aforementioned log2-ratios underwent DNA 
copy-number segmentation analysis utilizing the circular binary segmentation 
algorithm through the Bioconductor package “DNAcopy”.74 
Assessment of randomness in the overlap between the transcriptomics and aCGH 
data through Monte-Carlo simulation. To access the probability of the observed 
overlap between the transcriptionally affected genes (DNA-microarray for Saos2 and 
RNA-Seq for Li-Fraumeni p21 Tet-ON systems) and the genes present in the 
significantly affected genomic regions (aCGH data) being due to chance, a Monte-
Carlo simulation approach was utilized. Specifically, the genes present on the 
corresponding transcriptomics analysis platform (DNA-microarray for Saos2 and 
RNA-Seq for Li-Fraumeni) were randomly sampled 104 times with a sample size 
equal to the number of significantly regulated genes. For each random sampling the 
overlap with the genes present in regions exhibiting genomic aberrations according to 
aCGH was calculated. The distribution of the number of overlaps was found to be 
normal according to the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test for normality; hence the p-value of 
the observed overlap in our data was calculated. That p-value represents the 
probability of the observed overlap to belong to the distribution of the randomly 
 15 
 
generated overlaps, therefore being due to chance alone. All statistical analysis was 
carried 
out 
with 
R. 
All 
datasets 
were 
deposited 
at: 
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?token=oxcrwqcsppktped 
&acc=GSE62166, with GSE62166 dataset identifier for Affymetrix transcriptomics 
and aCGH, while SRP045212 identifier corresponds to WGS dataset. 
Pathway Analysis. Proteomics and transcriptomics data were analyzed with Ariadne 
Pathway Studio v9.0 as previously described.16 
 
Statistics and Reproducibility 
Parametric (t-test and one-way ANOVA) and non-parametric tests (Mann–Whitney 
and Kolmogorov-Smirnov test for normality), were used for hypothesis testing with p-
values <0.05 considered as significant.
