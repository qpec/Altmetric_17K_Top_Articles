Abstract
Objective
To compare neurofilament light (NfL) and tau as blood-based biomarkers for acute sports-
related concussion (SRC) and determine whether their concentrations at different time points
after the injury are associated with prolonged time to return to play (RTP).
Methods
A total of 288 professional hockey players were followed longitudinally from September 1,
2012, to April 30, 2015. Data collection and biomarker analyses were conducted between 2015
and 2017. Associations were tested between blood concentrations of NfL and tau, and RTP
time. Serum concentrations of S100B and neuron-specific enolase (NSE) were also measured
for comparison.
Results
Of 288 players, 105 sustained an SRC. Of these, 87 underwent blood sampling 1, 12, 36, and
144 hours after SRC and at the RTP time point. Serum NfL concentrations 1, 12, 36, and 144
hours after SRC were related to prolonged RTP time, and could separate players with RTP >10
days from those with RTP ≤10 days (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve
[AUROC] 0.82). Also, serum NfL 144 hours after SRC discriminated players who resigned
from the game due to persistent postconcussion symptoms (PCS) from those who returned to
play (AUROC 0.89). Plasma tau 1 hour after SRC was related to RTP but less strongly than
NfL, while S100B and NSE showed no such associations.
Conclusion
Serum NfL outperformed tau, S100B, and NSE as a biomarker for SRC. From a clinical
standpoint, serum NfL may be useful to identify individuals at risk of prolonged PCS, and may
aid in biomarker-informed decisions with regard to when RTP should be considered.

 Sports-related concussion (SRC) is a major health concern in
the United States, with an estimated 1.6–3.6 million cases
occurring annually.1 Although most concussed athletes re-
cover and return to play (RTP) within days to weeks, a subset
of these have neurobehavioral symptoms that may persist for
months to years.2 Determining when it may be considered
safe to RTP is essential, as athletes with premature RTP may
be at increased risk of developing persistent postconcussion
symptoms (PCS), especially if another concussion is
sustained.3–5 Thus, objective biomarkers that can monitor the
course of recovery in concussed athletes would be a major
contribution to the field.
Axonal injury, particularly injury to white matter axons, has
been hypothesized to be the key type of damage and the
primary determinant of outcome following traumatic brain
injury (TBI).6–9 Neurofilament light (NfL) and tau are axonal
proteins that have been reported to increase in CSF of indi-
viduals with both mild and severe TBI.5,8,10 We recently de-
veloped an immunoassay on the ultrasensitive Single
molecule assay (Simoa) platform for quantification of NfL in
blood with approximately 100-fold greater analytical sensi-
tivity compared with a standard immunoassay, allowing
measurement of NfL in all samples.11–13 In the context of
SRC, we observed increased concentrations of serum NfL in
boxers who received repetitive punches to the head.11 In
regards to plasma tau, also quantified by Simoa, we observed
increased levels in concussed hockey players compared with
preseason samples.14 Considering these promising isolated
findings, we herein compared the performances and temporal
dynamics of serum NfL and plasma tau following acute SRC
and examined whether increased blood concentrations of
these relate to prolonged RTP time in a large cohort of pro-
fessional hockey players. We also analyzed biomarkers related
to astrogliosis (S100 calcium binding protein B [S100B]) and
neuronal injury (neuron-specific enolase [NSE]) as these are
also implicated in TBI.15–17 We hypothesized that serum NfL
would be more strongly associated with SRC than tau, S100B,
and NSE.
Methods
Study population
This is a prospective cohort study of concussion among
professional hockey players (n = 288) from 14 teams in the
top Swedish Hockey League, who were followed longitudi-
nally from September 1, 2012, to April 1, 2015. Eighty-seven
players, who sustained SRC during this period, underwent
consecutive blood sampling at 1, 12, 36, and 144 hours after
SRC, or the day when the player returned to unrestricted
competition (RTP). Players from 4 of the contesting teams
were also sampled for baseline values prior to the start of the
hockey season (preseason samples). Players from one of the
teams were also sampled before (n = 28) and 1 (n = 20) and
12 (n = 19) hours after a friendly game without concussion
incidents. We also enrolled 19 neurologically healthy non-
athletic controls (HC) without known history of brain trauma
or any other neurologic disease as well as 12 noncontact sport
athletes, a group of gymnasts (GC), for comparison. Data
collection and blood biomarker analyses were conducted
between 2015 and 2017. Twenty-eight of the concussed
players as well as the preseason values from 2 of the above
teams have been previously reported.14
Study protocol
During the preseason, the physicians of all the 14 contesting
teams were provided with a concussion kit, containing injury
protocol, Rivermead Post-Concussion Symptoms Question-
naire (RPQ),18 instructions for blood tests, and blood sam-
pling equipment and tubes. As the teams move across the
country for playing matches, we also provided all the local
laboratories in the residing cities of each team with instruc-
tions to handle blood samples. The teams’ physicians were
present at all regular season games, documenting signs and
symptoms of concussion and physical examination findings in
the event of a concussion. The teams’ physicians also recorded
the date when a player had completely recovered from con-
cussion and was able to return to unrestricted competition.
Severity of SRC
The severity of SRC was graded according to the latest SRC
guidelines, which is based on the number of days it takes for
a player to RTP.19 The players who displayed clinical signs of
concussion during the game were removed from the game and
followed a graded RTP protocol.19 As approximately half of
the athletes returned to play within 10 days after an SRC, we
pre hoc defined the following severity categories: (1) RTP
≤10 days and (2) RTP >10 days. Our primary hypothesis was
that players with RTP >10 days would have higher concen-
trations of the biomarkers than players who could RTP within
10 days.
Biochemical procedures
Blood samples were collected by venipuncture into gel-
separator tubes for serum and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid
tubes for plasma and centrifuged within 20–60 minutes. Serum
and plasma were separated, aliquoted, and stored at −80°C

 pending biochemical analysis. Plasma tau was measured with
a commercially available immunoassay using digital array
technology (Quanterix Corporation, Lexington, MA).
Serum NfL and plasma tau were measured with novel
immunoassays using digital array technology (Quanterix
Corporation, Lexington, MA).11,20 The limit of detection for
the NfL assay is 0.29 pg/mL, which is approximately 100-fold
more sensitive than conventional assay for the protein, while
the limit of detection for tau is 0.02 pg/mL, which is over
1,000-fold more sensitive than conventional immunoassays
for the protein. Samples for S100B and NSE were analyzed on
a Modular E170 instrument (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim,
Germany) with reagents from the same manufacturer.
All samples were analyzed at the same time using the same
batch of reagents by board-certified laboratory technicians
who were blind to clinical information. As specified above, 28
of the players and preseason values from 2 of the contesting
teams were part of an earlier report from our group,14 but
their samples were re-analyzed in the current investigation to
minimize any influence of batch-related variation on the data.
Statistical analysis
For comparisons of blood biomarker concentrations vs the
preseason levels, the Mann-Whitney U test, and for multiple
time group comparison, the Kruskal-Wallis one-way analysis
of variance were used. The Spearman rank correlation co-
efficient (ρ) was used for analyses of correlation between
biomarkers and age. To examine the potential influence of age
on the results, we also performed analysis of covariance of log-
transformed continuous data with and without age as a cova-
riate. Partial correlation examined the associations between
blood biomarkers and RPQ scores adjusted for age. Logistic
regression models were constructed with the RTP duration
dichotomized (RTP >10 days vs RTP ≤10 days) as dependent
variable and biomarker as independent, covaried for age.
Continuous variables (age and biomarker concentrations) in
the logistic regression models were standardized (x−μ/σ;
where x is a raw/biomarker score, μ is the mean, and σ is the
SD) to facilitate comparisons between different biomarkers.
The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve
(AUROC) was calculated for determining the prognostic
accuracy of the biomarkers.
All tests were 2-sided and statistical significance was de-
termined at p < 0.05. Correction for multiple group com-
parison was done using the Dunn or Turkey test. All statistical
calculations were performed using GraphPad Prism 6.0
(GraphPad Inc., San Diego, CA) and R (v. 3.2.3, The R
Foundation for Statistical Computing).

Results
A total of 288 professional hockey players were followed
from August 1, 2012, to April 1, 2015. Of 288 players who
were followed for 3 years, 105 players were reported to have
sustained a SRC. Of these, 95 players consented to undergo
repeated blood sampling. For 8 of these players, there were
uncertainties regarding the diagnosis or RTP date, which
left 87 players in the final study cohort (figure 1). Forty-
nine of the 87 players had RTP ≤10 days, while 38 had RTP
>10 days (figure 1). Among players with RTP >10 days, 7
had persistent PCS for more than a year and eventually
resigned from the game. The demographic and clinical
characteristics of the study participants are summarized in
table 1. There was no difference in age between the
concussed players and the group of players who contributed
preseason samples or the HC (p = 0.30 and p = 0.99, re-
spectively, table 1). However, there was a difference in age
between the SRC group and GC (p < 0.001). There was no
association between age and any biomarker concentration
in concussed players except for tau (Spearman ρ = −0.31,
p = 0.0072; figure 2A). Plasma tau also correlated with age
in players who contributed preseason samples and in HC
(figure 2, B–C). There was also a correlation between age
and NSE in players who contributed preseason samples
(figure 2B).
Blood-based biomarkers across different
control groups
There was no significant difference in the concentration of
serum NfL and plasma tau between the HC, GC, or preseason
(p = 0.20 and p = 0.091, respectively; table 1). In contrast,
serum concentrations of S100B and NSE were increased in
preseason samples compared with HC and GC (p < 0.001 and
p < 0.0001, respectively; table 1).

 Blood NfL and tau changes following SRC
Serum NfL concentrations in samples collected 1 hour after
SRC were higher than in preseason, HC, and GC samples (p =
0.020, p = 0.030, and p = 0.010, respectively; table 1).
Figure 3A shows the time course of serum NfL in concussed
players (F1,242 = 69, p < 0.0001). After an initial increase at the
1-hour time point, serum NfL concentration dropped at 12
hours and increased again in a steady fashion, with the highest
concentrations in samples collected 10 days after injury (p <
0.0001, compared to all time points).
Plasma tau concentration 1 hour after SRC was higher than in
the group of hockey players who contributed samples prior to
the start of the season (p = 0.050; table 1). A similar result was
obtained when compared with the HC, but not compared
with GC (p = 0.0003, and p = 0.80, respectively; table 1).
Figure 3B shows the time course of plasma tau in concussed
players (F1,257 = 1929, p < 0.0001), where the concentrations
increased 1 hour after SRC and dropped at the 12-hour time
point (p < 0.0001), but rose again at 144 hours (p < 0.0001),
whereafter the levels normalized at RTP.
Serum S100B and NSE changes following SRC
Serum S100B concentration was elevated 1 hour after SRC
compared with preseason, HC, and GC (p = 0.0020, p <
0.0001, and p = 0.014, respectively; table 1). Also, serum NSE
concentrations increased 1 hour after SRC compared with the
HC, but not compared with GC or preseason samples (p =
0.0020, p = 0.80, and p = 0.55, respectively; table 1). Figure 3,
C–D, shows the time course of serum S100B. The highest

 levels of both S100B and NSE were seen 1 hour after SRC,
whereafter they rapidly decreased (F1,246 = 397, p < 0.0001
and F1,250 = 314, p < 0.0001 for S100B and NSE, respectively).
Association between blood biomarkers and
symptom severity
Concussed players had increased RPQ scores 1 hour after
SRC (median 16, interquartile range [IQR] 12–23) compared
with baseline (median 0.5, IQR 0.0–2.0) and HC (0.0, 16,
IQR 0.0–0.0; p < 0.0001). Both NfL and tau at the 1-hour
sampling time point correlated with RPQ scores (ρ = 0.41, p =
0.011, and ρ = 0.32, p = 0.056, respectively). There was no
correlation between the concentrations of S100B or NSE and
RPQ scores (ρ =0.12, p = 0.51, and ρ = −0.017, p = 0.92,
respectively).
Biomarker concentrations in relation to RTP
Serum NfL concentrations were increased in players with
RTP >10 days compared with players with RTP ≤10 days at
all measured time points (table 2). Serum NfL 1 hour after
SRC could separate players with RTP >10 days from RTP ≤10
days with an AUROC of 0.82 (p < 0.0001; figure 4A). The
AUROC for serum NfL remained high also at 12, 36, and 144
hour time points (0.72, 0.73, and 0.73, respectively; table 2).
In players who resigned from the game, serum NfL rose
continuously over the course of 144 hours compared with
players who could return to play, where the levels normalized
in almost all at RTP. Serum NfL concentrations at the 144-
hour time point could separate players who resigned from the
game from those who could RTP with an AUROC of 0.89
(p = 0.0050; figure 4A). Also, plasma tau concentrations 1
hour after SRC were increased in players with RTP >10 days
vs RTP ≤10 days; however, with limited prognostic utility
(AUROC 0.67; table 2). Plasma tau concentrations beyond
the 1-hour time point were not associated with duration of
RTP (table 2). In contrast, the other biomarkers performed
poorly in separating players with RTP >10 days from RTP
≤10 days (figure 4A and table 2). Also, the performance of tau,

 S100B, and NSE was inferior to NfL in separating players with
persistent PCS who resigned from the game from those who
could RTP (figure 4B).
Biomarker concentrations after a game
without concussion
Finally, to assess the effect of physical exertion on the blood
biomarker levels, players from one of the teams were sampled
prior to and 1 hour after a friendly game of hockey. The
concentrations of all the studied biomarkers, except for NfL,
increased 1 hour after a game of hockey without concussion
compared with levels prior to the game, and the levels nor-
malized at 12 hours after the game (table 3).
Discussion
In this study, we compared NfL head-to-head with tau, S100B,
and NSE as blood-based biomarkers for SRC and assessed
their relationship to duration of RTP in a large prospective
cohort of professional hockey players. The main findings were
that (1) serum NfL concentrations were increased 1, 12, 36,
and 144 hours after SRC compared with preseason concen-
trations with higher concentrations in athletes with RTP >10
days, (2) initial NfL concentrations correlated with RPQ
scores, and (3) serum NfL was the only biomarker that
remained elevated over time in the subset of players with
persistent PCS over 1 year who eventually resigned from the
game. In addition, we found that plasma tau concentration 1
hour after SRC increased compared with preseason levels;
elevated levels at the 1-hour time point were related to RTP
but with limited prognostic utility. Both S100B and NSE in-
creased 1 hour after SRC but without any correlations with
injury severity or duration of RTP. Finally, physical exercise
may be a confounder for all biomarkers except NfL.
A major challenge in the field of concussion has been de-
veloping conventional biomarkers that could identify indi-
viduals at risk of developing long-term or chronic PCS.
Experimental models link insufficient recovery or unresolved
concussion with greater neuropathology.3,4 Axonal injury,
including redistribution of neurofilament proteins, has been
hypothesized to be a central mechanism of TBI, and a major
determinant of outcome following TBI.7,8,21 Previous studies
measuring serum NfL in samples from patients with severe
TBI as well as neurodegenerative diseases have shown tight
correlations with corresponding CSF samples, suggesting that
serum NfL reflects axonal damage in the brain.11,12,22 In the
present study, serum NfL measured by Simoa increased in
professional hockey players immediately after SRC, with the
highest levels measured 144 hours after injury, and the levels
normalized in players who returned to play. Also, initial levels

 of serum NfL correlated with RPQ scores, and elevated serum
NfL concentrations 1–144 hours after SRC were related to
duration of RTP. These results corroborate the findings of
a recent study reporting increased CSF and serum NfL in
amateur boxers who received repetitive punches to the head,
but were not knocked out.23 In addition, in the subset of
players who resigned from the game due to persistent PCS, we
observed a sustained release of NfL over 144 hours. These
findings are in agreement with a recent study of persistent
PCS in professional hockey players, where the levels of NfL
were elevated in CSF months to years after recent SRC.5
Taken together, these results suggest that serum NfL analyzed
1–144 hours after SRC may be useful to identify individuals at
risk of prolonged PCS, and may aid in guiding objective
biomarker-based informed decisions with regard to RTP.
In recent years, a number of isolated and rather small studies
have found increased plasma tau after SRC.14,24,25 Consis-
tently, we also observed increased plasma tau 1 hour after
SRC compared with preseason samples. However, in com-
parison to serum NfL, tau showed inferior diagnostic and
prognostic utility at all the measured time points in the
present study. A previous smaller study of plasma tau in col-
lege athletes reported increased concentrations of tau 1 and
72 hours after SRC in the subset of athletes with RTP >10
days compared with those with RTP ≤10 days,24 a result that
we partially failed to replicate in this larger study. A possible
explanation could be that determining RTP in professional
athletes is more challenging due to other factors not present in
amateurs that may influence such decisions. Also, plasma tau
seems to be sensitive to physical exertion, and professional
athletes often follow a strict protocol of physical training after
24 hours of rest.19 In addition, we found no difference in the
concentrations of plasma tau between players with persistent
PCS who resigned from the game compared with those who
could RTP, while serum NfL was highly prognostic. These
findings are in line with NfL and tau measured in the CSF of
these players, where their CSF tau was unaltered, while CSF
NfL was elevated.5 Similar findings were also observed when
NfL and tau were measured in CSF of amateur boxers who
received repetitive punches to the head, with CSF tau showing
inferior correlation to the number of punches or severity of
head injury compared to CSF NfL.8
Similar to plasma tau, the concentrations of S100B and NSE
increased 1 hour after SRC and the levels normalized at the
12-hour time point. However, neither S100B nor NSE was
associated with the duration of RTP or RPQ scores. These
findings are in agreement with previous studies showing in-
creased concentrations after mild TBI, but with limited re-
lation to outcome.14,26 A crucial aspect of blood-based
biomarkers for SRC is insensitivity to peripheral/body trauma
or physical exertion. In the present study, all the measured
biomarkers, except NfL, increased in players after a friendly
game without head injury. In the case of plasma tau, it seems
that athletes as well as military personnel with a history of
blast-related concussion may have sustained increased plasma
tau in the absence of physical exertion.24,27 As for S100B and
NSE, several studies have found increased serum S100B and
NSE levels in the absence of head injury in soccer players,
marathon runners, and patients with peripheral trauma.28–30
Consistently, serum NSE concentrations were lower in
players who resigned compared with players who could RTP
(AUROC 0.80), which could be due to less influence of
physical exertion in the former subgroup.19 Serum NSE
concentration was also increased in GC without head trauma
compared with HC, adding further evidence that serum NSE
is sensitive to physical exertion. It is also worth mentioning
that both tau and NSE concentrations inversely correlated
with age, which thus should be taken into account when
interpreting results from these markers. Together, these
findings argue against tau, NSE, and S100B as blood-based
biomarkers for SRC, while the performance of serum NfL was
robust over the course of 6 days post SRC without being
sensitive to physical exertion.
The main limitation of this study is the lack of individual
baseline samples on all of the players, which precludes mon-
itoring biomarker changes preinjury and postinjury within
players. Also, our follow-up was not long; longitudinal studies
with follow-up times over many years are required to address
the risk or protective factors to sustain concussion or
recovery.
NfL outperformed tau as well as S100B and NSE as a blood-
based biomarker for acute SRC. Integrating measurement of
serum NfL in the clinical evaluation of concussed athletes may
aid in objectively identifying and assessing those at increased
risk of poor recovery to help prevent the development of long-
term PCS.

Study question
How do neurofilament light (NF-L) and tau compare in terms
of utility as blood-based predictive biomarkers for prolonged
time until return-to-play (RTP) following a sports-related
concussion (SRC)?
Summary answer
Serum NF-L outperforms plasma tau in predicting prolonged
RTP time following an SRC.
What is known and what this paper adds
Premature RTP following an SRC increases the risk of per-
sistent post-concussive symptoms; therefore, determining
a safe RTP time is a critical component of post-SRC care. This
study explores the possibility of using blood-based biomarkers
of axonal injury to estimate safe RTP times.
Participants and setting
This study examined 87 Swedish Hockey League players (me-
dian age at SRC, 26 years; interquartile range, 22–29 years) who
experienced SRCs between September 1, 2012 and April 1,
2015.
Design, size, and duration
Hockey team physicians were given standardized equipment
and instructions for collecting blood samples 1, 12, 36, and 144
hours after each SRC, as well as when the player RTP. Serum
NF-L and plasma tau levels in the blood samples were quan-
tified with novel immunoassays involving digital array tech-
nology. These assays were conducted between 2015 and 2017
by technicians who were blinded to clinical information.
Primary outcomes
The primary outcome was RTP time, which was classified as
≤10 days or >10 days.
Main results and the role of chance
The RTP time was ≤10 days for 49 (56%) participants and
>10 days for 38 (44%) participants. These 2 groups could be
distinguished based on serum NF-L levels 1, 12, 36, and 144
hours after the SRC. They could also be distinguished based on
plasma tau levels 1 hour after the SRC, but plasma tau levels at
later timepoints lacked prognostic utility.
Bias, confounding, and other reasons
for caution
This study lacked pre-SRC biomarker data for the partic-
ipants. The follow-up period was short, and longitudinal
studies will be necessary to clarify the utility of blood-based
biomarkers for predicting long-term consequences and re-
covery from an SRC.
Generalizability to other populations
The participants in this study were professional athletes;
therefore, the generalizability of the results to amateur ath-
letes may be limited.
