Abstract 
5 
The objective of the current study was to ascertain whether taking part in a sensory play 
6 
activity with real fruits and vegetables (FV) can encourage tasting in preschool children, 
7 
compared to a non-food activity or visual exposure to the activity. Three to four year old pre-
8 
school children (N=62) were recruited from three preschool nursery classes from a school in 
9 
Northamptonshire, UK. A between participants experimental study was conducted with each 
10 
class assigned to one of three conditions; sensory FV play, sensory non-food play and visual 
11 
FV exposure. Parental report of several baseline variables were taken; child baseline liking of 
12 
the foods used in the study, parental and child FV consumption (portions/day), child 
13 
neophobia and child tactile sensitivity. Outcome measures were the number of fruits and 
14 
vegetables tasted in a post experiment taste test which featured (n=5) or did not feature (n=3) 
15 
in the task. Analyses of covariance controlling for food neophobia and baseline liking of 
16 
foods, showed that after the activity children in the sensory FV play condition tried more FV 
17 
than both children in the non- food sensory play task (p<0.001) and children  in the visual FV 
18 
exposure task (p<0.001). This was true not only for five foods used in the activity (p<0.001), 
19 
but also three foods that were not used in the activity (p<0.05). Sensory play activities using 
20 
fruits and vegetables may encourage FV tasting in preschool children more than non food 
21 
play or visual exposure alone. Long term intervention studies need to be carried out to see if 
22 
these effects can be sustained over time.

Introduction 
29 
Many children do not consume the recommended daily intake of fruit and vegetables (FV) 
30 
which are a good source of vitamins and minerals (World Health Organisation, 2003) and 
31 
have been found in multiple epidemiological studies to be associated with a lower risk of 
32 
chronic health conditions (Dauchet, Amouyel, Hercberg  & Dallongeville, 2006). It is 
33 
estimated that only 16% of pre-school children in the UK eat the recommended daily 
34 
allowance of five portions of FV,  (Health Survey for England, 2008) and fruits and 
35 
vegetables are the most commonly rejected food groups in this age group (Cooke, Wardle & 
36 
Gibson, 2003; Russell & Worsely, 2008). Research has found that both pre-school and home 
37 
environments can improve young children's FV consumption through repeated and frequent 
38 
tasting known as taste exposure (Caton et al., 2012; Parmer, Salisbury-Glennon, Shannon & 
39 
Struempler, 2009; Holley, Haycraft & Farrow, 2015). It has long been believed that tasting is 
40 
the most important means to establishing FV preference, and children have to taste foods in 
41 
order to make the unfamiliar familiar (Birch et al., 1987).  
42 
 There is a developmental trajectory of the number of tasting occasions (exposures) needed to 
43 
establish preference, (Sullivan & Birch, 1994) with young infants showing a preference after 
44 
fewer exposures in comparison to older children from 2 years onwards (Maier et al., 2007; 
45 
Sullivan & Birch, 1990;  Howard et al., 2012). Child refusal of new foods however is often 
46 
translated by caregivers as a genuine dislike for the foods which prevents them from carrying 
47 
out the requisite number of exposures (Campbell & Crawford, 2001; Skinner et al., 2002). In 
48 
addition actually getting children to taste, and therefore be exposed to, novel foods can be 
49 
challenging, as young children will reject on sight rather than taste (Dovey et al., 2012). As 
50 
most healthy eating interventions rely on taste exposure, coupled with other proven strategies 
51 
such as modelling and rewards, (Holley et al., 2015; Horne et al., 2011) it is important to 
52 
strike a balance between encouragement to taste and prompting/pressure to eat, which can 
53 
have a detrimental effect on tasting (Osborne & Forestell, 2012).  
54 
Recently it has been suggested that interventions should add an element of non-taste sensory 
55 
exposure, to encourage familiarisation with the sensory properties of fruits and vegetables 
56 
(Dazeley, Houston-Price & Hill, 2012).  Some intervention studies have looked at activities, 
57 
that can be carried out prior to tasting, to examine whether these can encourage children to 
58 
overcome their natural neophobic reaction (e.g. Witt & Dunn, 2012). Some studies have 
59 
focussed on sensory education, in ‘Classes de Gout’ where children are educated about

evaluating the sensory taste properties of food (Mustonen & Tuorila, 2010; Reverdy et al., 
61 
2008). These studies, whilst successful, have been aimed at older children who can 
62 
understand the terminology and format of sensory education sessions. Recent interventions, 
63 
looking at multisensory educational tasks in preschool children, such as exploring the insides 
64 
of fruits, have found some increases in fruit and vegetable acceptance (Dazeley & Houston-
65 
Price, 2015; Hoppu et al., 2015). Other interventions, such as ‘Color me Healthy’ which have 
66 
used imaginative physical games (for example pretending to climb a mountain, make a camp 
67 
and then making a vegetable stew), and have been more successful in increasing 
68 
consumption, perhaps because they have a greater element of fun and reward built into the 
69 
intervention (Witt & Dunn, 2012). Although these intervention studies have been successful 
70 
in increasing tasting and preference for foods, it is unclear what aspects of these multifaceted 
71 
interventions are responsible for the observed improvements. 
72 
Some recent behavioural studies have attempted to isolate aspects of sensory exposure, and 
73 
have found that children’s enjoyment ratings of the feel of non-food substances (jelly and 
74 
mashed potatoes; Coulthard & Thakker, 2015) and a range of food andnon-food substances 
75 
(e.g. Hair gel, cookie dough, shrimp crackers, sand paper; Neederkorn, Jansen & Havermans, 
76 
2015) is associated with lower food neophobia. Although these studies were correlational, 
77 
they suggest that there is an association between enjoyment of touch and food acceptance, 
78 
and both authors suggest that expected mouth-feel, the sensation of foods in the mouth, may 
79 
be the reason behind this association. Some experiments looking at sensory rating of FV in 
80 
school children have examined which sensory domain is the most important factor in 
81 
determining food rejection and acceptance, have found developmental differences, with 
82 
younger children rejecting according to visual cues and older children using olfactory cues 
83 
when deciding to try or reject a novel fruit or vegetable (Dovey et al., 2012; Coulthard, 
84 
Palfreyman & Morizet, 2016). Intervention studies with visual exposure to FV using picture 
85 
books, has been found to successfully increase tasting and liking of FV (Osborne & Forestell, 
86 
2012; Heath, Houston-Price & Kennedy, 2011; Houston-Price, Butler & Shiba, 2009).  
87 
The main purpose of the present study was to examine whether a creative multi-sensory play 
88 
game using fruits and vegetables carried out prior to a tasting session, can influence tasting 
89 
behaviour in young children. Children who take part in a sensory play task, where they create 
90 
pictures using real FV stimuli (Sensory FV play), will be more likely to try FV afterwards, 
91 
than children who take part in a sensory play task with non-food items (sensory non-food 
92

play) or watching the researcher carry out the FV play task (visual FV exposure). In addition 
93 
it is expected that children in the visual exposure condition where they are exposed to real 
94 
FV, will try more FV than those in a tactile non-food play condition. 
95 
Experimental Methods 
96 
Participants  
97 
One hundred and twenty recruitment letters and questionnaire packs were distributed to all 
98 
the parents of preschool children from three different classes who attended a local 
99 
government-run nursery in Northamptonshire, UK. Sixty-eight parents returned the baseline 
100 
questionnaires, of which six were not present on the day or were excluded as they had known 
101 
food allergies. The final sample comprised sixty-two children (27 boys and 35 girls) with a 
102 
mean age of 3.36 (±0.52) years. Parents’ ages ranged from 22 – 45 years of age, with a mean 
103 
age of 34.20 (±6.25) years. The majority of the sample (n=61) were White-British, with the 
104 
exception of one child and parent who were of Chinese origin. The study was approved by 
105 
De Montfort University Ethics Committee and all parents gave their informed consent prior 
106 
to data collection. A G power a priori analysis indicated that for moderate to large effect 
107 
sizes, a sample of 17-40 participants in each condition was needed. 
108 
Design 
109 
The study was a cross-sectional, between-participants experimental design. The dependent 
110 
variable was the number of foods tasted by the children after the experimental task. The 
111 
factor was the condition the child was in (FV play task, non-food play control vs visual 
112 
exposure control). Each class was randomly allocated to one condition by picking numbers 
113 
from a hat. This clustered randomisation was adopted to prevent children from being exposed 
114 
to the other experimental conditions. There were several covariates which were examined, 
115 
including child food neophobia, parent & child FV daily portions, child tactile sensitivity and 
116 
child baseline liking of experimental foods.

All parents were given a questionnaire pack, along with information about the study, a week 
120 
before the experimental tasks were carried out. Children were included in the study if their 
121 
parents filled in the questionnaires and gave informed consent for their child to be included. 
122 
Child Neophobia Food Scale (CFNS) 
123 
The CFNS (Pliner & Hobden, 1992) adapted by Wardle, Carnell and Cooke (2005) measures 
124 
willingness to eat novel foods and is viewed as reliable and valid (Ritchey et al. 2004; Cooke 
125 
et al., 2004). The scale consists of six statements, for example ‘My child is afraid to try food 
126 
they have never had before’ rated using a 4 point response scale from strongly agree (4) to 
127 
strongly disagree (1), with overall scores ranging from 6 to 24 with a higher score indicating 
128 
higher levels of food neophobia.  This score was referred to as child food neophobia. 
129 
 
130 
Tactile sensitivity (Sensory Profile) 
131 
Child’s tactile sensitivity, was measured using twelve items from a subsection of Dunn’s 
132 
Sensory Profile (Dunn, 1997) which has been used with both non-clinical and clinical 
133 
samples of children (Miller-Kuhaneck et al., 2007; Tomchek & Dunn, 2007) and in previous 
134 
studies relating to food acceptance (Coulthard & Blissett, 2009). An example of a statement 
135 
is, “My child becomes irritated by shoes or socks”. Statements were rated by parents using a 
136 
5 point Likert scale, from always (5) to never (1) with the items scored in this study so that 
137 
higher scores indicated high sensitivity to tactile stimuli. Cronbach’s Alpha for the scale in 
138 
the current study was 0.69, which was considered acceptable. 
139 
Fruit & vegetable portions (child and parent) 
140 
The amount of FV consumed by parents and children was measured using estimated recall 
141 
which has been used in other studies (Coulthard & Blissett, 2009) and has been validated 
142 
against 4-day diaries (Bingham et al., 1994). There was one scale for the mother to fill in 
143 
about herself, and then a second scale to complete in relation to her childs typical 
144 
consumption, Mothers were asked to report how many portions of fruits, and then vegetables 
145 
(not potatoes) 1) they consumed in a typical week and then 2) their child consumed in a 
146 
typical week. The size of a portion was clearly defined in the instructions, based on UK 
147 
guidelines (NHS 5 day, 2013). For both the parent score and the child score the fruit and 
148 
vegetable consumption  scores were summed and divided by 7, to give a daily FV score. 
149 
These are referred to as child FV portion and parent FV portion.

Experimental study 
151 
In each condition, children were tested in a single half day session at a similar time shortly 
152 
after they had been dropped off. Children were seated at a table in a group of four-five, and 
153 
were asked to rate their liking of eight pictures of foods used in the taste tests. Then they 
154 
carried out the sensory task (sensory FV play, sensory non-food play, visual FV exposure). 
155 
The children then left the table, and the researcher cleaned away all the play materials. 
156 
Finally, one at a time, children were invited to sit down individually for the tasting task. 
157 
 
158 
Baseline liking for the experimental foods.  
159 
The eight foods used in study as fruits and vegetables were used in the taste tests were 
160 
carrots, banana, cucumber, tomatoes, blueberries pomegranate, kiwi, and melon. A sheet of 
161 
paper with colour 5cm &5cm images of the eight foods were presented to each child with a 
162 
three point smiley face rating scale, and the child was asked to indicate how much they liked 
163 
each of the foods (Carraway-Stage et al, 2014). The photographs were taken from stock 
164 
images, and represented a prototype photograph of each of the stimuli foods. Baseline liking 
165 
of these foods was calculated by indicated whether the child liked (score=1) or didn’t like/ 
166 
was neutral towards (score=0) the food. Each child obtained a score of 0-8 for baseline liking 
167 
of the experimental foods.  
168 
 
169 
Experimental tasks 
170 
Materials: Eleven FVs were used in the sensory FV play and visual exposure conditions. The 
171 
prepared FV for the play activity was placed on the table in individual transparent containers 
172 
and included broccoli, carrots, spinach, banana, radishes, green beans, oranges, lemons, 
173 
cucumber, tomatoes, and blueberries. The materials for the non-food sensory play were items 
174 
placed in bowls in the middle of the table were glues and eleven substances such as 
175 
pompoms, sequins, foam shapes, feathers, lollipop sticks, glitter and pipe cleaners.  
176 
Procedure: The duration of the task and researcher carrying out the task was consistent 
177 
across all three conditions. The content of the tasks differed slightly between the three 
178 
conditions. In two of the tasks (FV play and non-food play) which involved children creating 
179 
a sensory picture, the format of the task was identical. Children were asked to sit in a group 
180 
of 5 children with the researcher at an activity table. In order to give the children some ideas 
181 
for their creation there were printed images from the Very Hungry Caterpillar (Carle, 1969), 
182 
which is a classic and well known children’s’ book in the UK which features FV. The 
183 
researcher named the materials (FV or non-food), and then talked about making some 
184

7 
 
pictures on the plates provided. Children were encouraged to feel comfortable and engage in 
185 
conversation during the task if they wished to. Each child was given an 8” paper plate on 
186 
which to create their picture. Each child created their pictures for 5-10 minutes alongside the 
187 
researcher who modelled a picture of the Very Hungry Caterpillar on their own plate. They 
188 
had no implements to pick up the substances, so in order to create a picture they had to pick 
189 
up the items with their fingers. Children were encouraged to squash or reshape the foods if 
190 
they wanted to. They were not encouraged to taste the foods in the FV sensory play task, as 
191 
the primary object of the task was non taste exposure. They were given the opportunity to 
192 
wash their hands after the experimental task. 
193 
In the Visual Exposure to FV condition, the groups of children watched the researcher make a 
194 
picture of the Very Hungry Caterpillar with the fruits and vegetables on a paper plate. The 
195 
format of the task was similar except the researcher modelled the creation of the picture, and 
196 
the children were not given an opportunity to complete the task themselves. 
197 
 
198 
Post activity taste test 
199 
Eight foods were given to children to taste in the post activity taste test, and were chosen on 
200 
the basis that they could be eaten raw. Altogether there were was one root vegetable, two 
201 
salad vegetables and five fruits.  Five of the fruits and vegetables had been used in the FV 
202 
play and visual exposure task (carrots, banana, cucumber, tomatoes, blueberries) and three 
203 
fruits that had not featured in any of the conditions (pomegranate, kiwi, and melon). Foods 
204 
were prepared in a conventional format, depending on the food in question. Banana, carrot, 
205 
tomatoes and kiwi were presented sliced, melon was presented cubed, blueberries were 
206 
presented whole and pomegranates were presented as individual seeds. 
207 
Once the children had finished making a picture (or watching the researcher make the 
208 
picture), they were tested individually and asked “whether they wanted to taste some fruits 
209 
and vegetables”. The children were given a napkin and offered the eight FV to taste. Whether 
210 
or not the child tasted the fruit was recorded on the taste record sheet. Each food was given a 
211 
score of 1 if the child placed it in their mouths, regardless of whether it was swallowed. The 
212 
number of foods tasted was given an overall score (range 0-8), a score for foods featured in 
213 
conditions 1 and 3 (range 0-5) and a score for foods tasted not featured in any condition 
214 
(range 0-3).

All data analyses were carried out on IBM SPSS version 22 (IBM, 2013)). Normality tests 
218 
indicated that the variables were normally distributed across the sample, so parametric 
219 
statistics were carried out on the data. Pearson’s correlations were carried out to examine 
220 
relationships between the baseline variables (tactile sensitivity, food neophobia, FV 
221 
consumption) and the tasting measures. One way ANOVAs were carried out to examine 
222 
differences in the baseline variables of demographics (age and sex), food consumption 
223 
variables (FV portions, FV range, child food neophobia, baseline liking of foods in taste 
224 
activity) and child tactile sensitivity, between the three conditions. Brown Forsyth corrections 
225 
were used if Levene’s test indicated homogeneity of variance could not be assumed (p<0.05). 
226 
Bonferroni post hoc tests were carried out to examine the mean differences between the 
227 
different conditions. Three analyses of covariance were carried out, as it was found that 
228 
tasting foods in the final condition was associated with child food neophobia scores and 
229 
baseline liking of foods in the experimental conditions, therefore these two variables were 
230 
entered as covariates into the equation. The three dependent variables were the total number 
231 
of foods tasted (n=8), the foods tasted featured in the experimental task (n=5) and the foods 
232 
tasted not featured in the experimental tasks (n=3). Custom interaction models were carried 
233 
out and it was found that the assumptions of linearity were met in all three interactions 
234 
(p>0.05). Finally Chi Square analyses were carried out to examine whether there were 
235 
differences in tasting between the groups according to the food stimuli (blueberry, 
236 
pomegranate, melon, kiwi, banana, carrot, tomatoes, cucumber), 
237 
 
238 
Results 
239 
The descriptive statistics for the baseline characteristics of the sample are given in table 1. 
240 
The average portions of FV consumed by both parent and child participants in the study was 
241 
found to be similar to government statistical reports (Health Survey for England, 2008), with 
242 
24 % of children and 18 % of parents in this study achieving five portions of fruit and 
243 
vegetables a day. The mean daily consumption rates of 3.4 portions/d for children and 3.0  
244 
portions/d for parents was broadly in line with the mean UK average of 2.8 portions/d, 
245 
(Health Survey for England, 2008)  and consumption rates found in other studies (Wardle et 
246 
al., 2005;Coulthard & Blissett, 2009).  
247 
[TABLE 1 ABOUT HERE] 
248 
There was no difference in baseline measures of tactile sensitivity, food neophobia, parental 
249 
FV consumption, child FV consumption, and baseline liking between the three conditions 
250 
(table 2). Pearson product moment correlations carried out to look at associations between the

tasting variables and parental report measures, found that food neophobia was negatively 
252 
associated with tasting whilst baseline liking of foods was positively associated with tasting 
253 
(table 3). 
254 
[TABLES 2 & 3 ABOUT HERE] 
255 
Pearson’s product moment correlations were carried out to examine associations between 
256 
baseline measures of food acceptance and child tactile processing (see table 4). It was found 
257 
that there were negative associations with FV consumption variables (child and parent) and 
258 
child neophobia. Tactile sensitivity was positively associated with food neophobia and 
259 
negatively associated baseline FV liking, and also with the daily FV portions consumed by 
260 
both parents and children. 
261 
 
262 
[TABLE 4 ABOUT HERE] 
263 
 
264 
Three analyses of covariance (ANCOVA) were carried out to examine whether there were 
265 
differences in of the number of foods tasted in particular 1) all foods, 2) foods that featured in 
266 
the task and 3) foods that didn’t feature in the task (see table 5). Child food neophobia and 
267 
baseline FV liking were entered into the analyses as covariates as they were found to be 
268 
associated with the number of foods tasted in correlation analyses (see table 3). After 
269 
controlling for the covariates there was a difference between the number of foods tasted 
270 
across the three groups, F(2, 57) = 12.08, p=0.001, ηp
2= 0.29, which indicated a large effect 
271 
size. Bonferroni post hoc analyses indicated that children in the sensory play FV condition 
272 
tasted more FV than children in the sensory play non-food condition (p<0.001) or the visual 
273 
FV exposure condition (p<0.001). There was no difference in tasting of all foods between 
274 
children in the sensory play non-food condition and children in the visual FV exposure 
275 
condition. 
276 
For the foods tasted which featured in the experimental task, there was a difference between 
277 
tasting across the three groups, F(2, 57) = 13.78, p<0.001, ηp
2= 0.32 which indicated a large 
278

For the foods tasted that were not featured in the experimental task there was a difference 
284 
between tasting across the three groups, F(2, 57) = 4.17, p<0.05, ηp
2= 0.13, which indicated a 
285 
moderate effect size. Post hoc Bonferroni analyses indicated that children in the sensory play 
286 
FV condition tasted more FV than children in the sensory play non-food condition (p<0.05) 
287 
or the visual FV exposure condition (p<0.05). There was no difference in tasting of non-

visual FV exposure condition.

Examination of the pattern of foods tasted across the experimental groups showed that some 
293 
foods were accepted more readily than others (see table 6). In particular, children in the 
294 
sensory FV play group tasted more cucumber, blueberries, pomegranate and kiwi. There were 
295 
no significant differences in tasting for banana, carrots, tomatoes and melon.

Discussion   
299 
The main aim of this study was to examine whether pre-school children who took part in a 
300 
multisensory play activity with fruits and vegetables, without pressure to eat or to try the 
301 
foods, would taste more FV than children engaged in a non- food activity or those visually 
302 
exposed to the activity. It was found that children in the sensory FV play condition tried 
303 
significantly more fruits and vegetables post activity than children in the other two 
304 
conditions, even after controlling for the covariates of child food neophobia and baseline 
305 
liking of featured foods. In addition this effect was found for both FV featured in the tasks, 
306 
and FV not featured in the tasks. A possible explanation for these findings is that children in 
307 
the sensory play group had the time to familiarise themselves and interact with FV, which 
308 
would suggest that exposure does not have to be based on taste alone, but familiarity can be 
309 
increased through exposure to the non-taste sensory properties of fruits and vegetables. It was 
310 
apparent in our study, that the largest benefits were seen for foods that are less familiar, such 
311 
as pomegranate and kiwi. This finding supports previous studies which found an association 
312 
between tactile play and food neophobia (Coulthard & Thakker, 2015; Coulthard & Sahota, 
313 
2016). It also supports the findings of intervention studies that have included an element of

11 
 
sensory play such as the ‘Color me healthy’ intervention programme (Witt & Dunn, 2012) as 
315 
well as sensory education programmes aimed at preschool (Dazeley & Houston-Price, 2015) 
316 
and older children (Mustonen & Tuorila, 2010).  
317 
The main difference between previous intervention research and the present study was the 
318 
adoption of an experimental design to isolate one task that could featue a multi-sensory 
319 
intervention, and examine its efficacy in encouraging tasting in the short term. Although 
320 
many previous studies have examined sensory education in preschool children (Hoppu et al., 
321 
2015; Dazeley & Houston-Price, 2015) we decided to examine fun, game based activities 
322 
which don’t have an explicit educational component (Witt & Dunn, 2012). We concluded 
323 
that taking part in a sensory activity with FV actually encourages tasting and that that tasks 
324 
using real FV are more effective than general sensory play tasks (Coulthard & Sahota, 2016) 
325 
or visual exposure to FV (Heath et al., 2011). It was expected that visual exposure alone, in 
326 
watching the researcher carry out the tasks with the foods, would increase tasting relative to 
327 
the non-food sensory task. Previous research has proposed that visual exposure can be an 
328 
important contributor to tasting (Houston-Price et al., 2009) and visual modelling of 
329 
consumption is widely used in interventions to increase FV consumption in children (Horne 
330 
et al., 2011). However we did not find that visual exposure to real FV was more effective in 
331 
encouraging tasting than tactile play with non-food substances. This discrepancy may be 
332 
explained by the fact that previous research examining visual exposure, has used repeated 
333 
exposure to the fruits and vegetables, for example parents reading a picture book multiple 
334 
times (Houston-Price et al.), which more accurately mirrors classic repeated exposure studies 
335 
(Sullivan & Birch, 1994; Maier et al., 2008).  Our study was the first to use a single session 
336 
multisensory task, which may indicate that using multisensory exposure may lead to more 
337 
rapid acceptance than visual exposure. It could be argued, however, that children in our 
338 
sample in the visual exposure condition may have felt they missed out by watching the task 
339 
rather than being an agent within the task. Future studies should compare games using visual 
340 
images of foods vs real foods, to ascertain whether visual exposure alone can effectively 
341 
encourage tasting in children. 
342 
Previous research has found associations with tactile sensory processing and food neophobia, 
343 
in particular that children who are more sensitive to tactile sensation in the environment are 
344 
more reluctant to eat novel foods both as babies, (Coulthard, Fogel & Harris, 2016) as 
345 
children  (Coulthard & Thakker, 2015) and as adults (Coulthard & Sahota, 2016). The 
346 
 MANUSCRIPT

12 
 
association between the dislike of the feel of substances on the skin, in particular on the 
347 
hands in messy play activities and reluctance to eat novel foods, may be due to dislike of the 
348 
‘mouth feel’ of unfamiliar foods (Smith, Roux, Naidoo & Venter, 2005). Although an 
349 
association has consistently been found between food neophobia and sensory sensitivity, 
350 
often there has been no association between the amount of FV consumed in daily portions 
351 
and tactile processing (Coulthard & Blissett, 2009). In the present sample tactile sensitivity 
352 
was negatively associated with baseline FV liking and the portions of FV consumed by 
353 
parents and children. It may be in younger samples, tactile sensitivity is more strongly 
354 
associated with aversion to the feel of fruits and vegetables leading to reduced consumption. 
355 
As children get older, they may eat greater amounts of a few ‘safe’ fruits and vegetables if 
356 
they are food neophobic. Interestingly, parental reports of tactile sensitivity were not 
357 
associated with the number of foods tasted after the sensory tasks. This could be because 
358 
some of the foods featured in the tasks were relatively familiar foods, and if we had used 
359 
foods with more ‘challenging’ textures such as passion fruit and lychee, we may have found 
360 
an association between baseline tactile processing and FV tasting.  More research is needed 
361 
to examine the relationship between the tactile processing and food acceptance, especially in 
362 
relation to food texture, in terms the variety and amount of food consumed, across the 
363 
lifespan. 
364 
There is a considerable amount of research that suggests prompting or pressure to try novel or 
365 
disliked foods can have an adverse effect on willingness to taste and liking (Osborne & 
366 
Forestell, 2012). This is one of the problems of interventions to increase healthy eating, most 
367 
of which rely on tasting as the main goal of any task (Ahern et al., 2014) and it may explain 
368 
why so many taste exposures are needed to overcome the neophobic food response in 
369 
children aged 2-4 years (Sullivan & Birch, 1994). In our sensory play conditions, there was 
370 
no mention of tasting the foods; the goal of the task was to engage with the food, and create 
371 
something from it. This is true non taste sensory exposure, and it may be that these types of 
372 
activities may actually increase the likelihood of tasting by getting children to associate the 
373 
foods themselves with pleasurable, reward based activities. It would be interesting to examine 
374 
non-taste sensory exposure in combination with other effective strategies such as modelling 
375 
and rewards (Holley, Haycraft & Farrow, 2015).  
376 
There are many strengths of the present research, in particular the experimental design and 
377 
the variety of food items used. There were several limitations, however, which need to be 
378 
 MANUSCRIPT

ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
Sensory fruit & vegetable play 
 
13 
 
acknowledged. Firstly, there were more fruits than vegetables featured in the tasks and taste 
379 
tests, especially in the category of foods not featured in the tasks. This was mainly because 
380 
we needed foods that could be eaten raw. However future research should look at fruits and 
381 
vegetables separately, as there is a drive for researchers and health professionals to view them 
382 
as distinct but related food groups (Osborne & Forestell, 2012).  Secondly, although we had a 
383 
child-report of whether they liked the foods in the study prior to the tasks, we did not include 
384 
a pre taste measure of the foods. It is possible that some children are more likely to taste 
385 
foods in front of a relatively unknown researcher, so a true baseline measure of tasting, 
386 
preferably carried out a week prior to the sensory play tasks, would be essential in future 
387 
research. Thirdly, a second researcher should have rated the tasting task, although we felt that 
388 
the overt behaviour of tasting vs not tasting the fruit or vegetable was felt to be a relatively 
389 
straightforward behaviour to judge. Lastly, we didn’t have a separate control group that 
390 
neither took part in a sensory activity or a visual exposure activity. Previous research has 
391 
found these two activities to be associated with tasting (Heath, Houston-Price & Kennedy, 
392 
2011; Coulthard & Thakker, 2015). Although this research suggests that such activities are 
393 
less effective than the use of real FV in activities, it could be that visual exposure and non-
394 
food tactile play may also encourage tasting and food acceptance. In addition, experiments of 
395 
this nature, which are based on short term outcomes, do not measure the efficacy of these 
396 
tasks over time. Although the experimental design ensures that it cannot simply be the 
397 
attention of taking part in a game with a novel adult that encourages compliance in tasting, it 
398 
could be that the relative novelty of being encouraged to play with food (as opposed to more 
399 
familiar messy non-food play tasks), may have added an element of novelty which may 
400 
diminish over repeated sessions. It could be argued that anything which encourages initial 
401 
exposure in this particularly difficult age group will facilitate the adoption of healthful FV 
402 
consumption. Future research should track the success of these strategies repeated over time, 
403 
compared to strategies which vary in novelty. 
404 
This is one of the first studies to experimentally examine whether playing a creative non taste 
405 
exposure activity with children, can encourage tasting of featured foods in a subsequent taste 
406 
session. Any activity which encourages initial tasting in this age group, who are known to be 
407 
often reluctant to taste fruits and vegetables, may potentially be used to facilitate taste 
408 
exposure and eventual liking. We have found that creating pictures with fruits and vegetables 
409 
was more effective in encouraging tasting than watching the researcher create a picture or 
410 
playing a non-food sensory play game. This finding suggests that introducing food in a play 
411

Sensory fruit & vegetable play 
 
14 
 
environment which allows children to see, handle and smell foods, developing non taste 
412 
sensory familiarisation, should be embedded in strategies to increase FV consumption. 
413 
Further research should aim to examine the relative contribution of the different sensory 
414 
aspects of multisensory programmes, to examine what aspects of touching, smelling, seeing 
415 
and hearing foods leads to greater acceptance.  It is apparent that, in the future, interventions 
416 
need to be constructed that embed these activities in school and preschool environments, to 
417 
ascertain whether such tasks will lead to increases in the portions and variety of FV 
418 
consumed by children.
