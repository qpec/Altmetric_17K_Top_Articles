BACKGROUND: Although Asian Americans are at high
risk for type 2 diabetes, it is not known whether they are
appropriately screened for this disease.
OBJECTIVE: To assess racial and ethnic disparities in
diabetes screening between Asian Americans and other
adults.
DESIGN: Analysis of pooled cross-sectional data from 45
U.S. states and territories using the 2012–2014 Behav-
ioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. We calculated the
weighted proportions of adults in each racial and ethnic
group who received recommended diabetes screening. To
assess for racial and ethnic disparities, we used multivar-
iable logistic regression to model receipt of recommended
diabetes screening as a function of race and ethnicity,
adjusting for demographics, healthcare access, survey
year, and state.
PARTICIPANTS: A total of 526,000 adults who were eligi-
ble to receive diabetes screening according to American
Diabetes Association guidelines from 2012 to 2014 (age ≥
45 years or age < 45 years with a body mass index [BMI] ≥
25 kg/m2).
MAIN MEASURES: Self-reported receipt of diabetes
screening (defined as a test for high blood sugar or
diabetes within the past 3 years) and self-reported
race/ethnicity (non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic
Asian, non-Hispanic Pacific Islander, non-Hispanic
American Indian or Alaskan Native, non-Hispanic
black, Hispanic or Latino, and non-Hispanic multi-
racial or other).
KEY RESULTS: Asian Americans were the least likely
racial and ethnic group to receive recommended diabetes
screening. Overall, Asian Americans had 34% lower ad-
justed odds of receiving recommended diabetes screening
compared to non-Hispanic whites (95 % CI: 0.60, 0.73). In
subgroup analyses by age and weight status, disparities
were widest among obese Asian Americans ≥ 45 years
(AOR = 0.56; 95 % CI: 0.39, 0.81). Disparities persisted
among Asian Americans who completed other types of
preventive cancer screening.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite their high risk of diabetes, Asian
Americans were the least likely racial and ethnic group to
receive recommended diabetes screening.

INTRODUCTION
Pervasive racial and ethnic health disparities have been docu-
mented throughout the U.S. population.1,2 An increasing num-
ber of studies have focused specifically on disparities among
Asian Americans,3,4 the most rapidly growing racial and eth-
nic population in the United States.5 One particularly critical
disparity for this population is their elevated risk of type 2
diabetes.5–8 Diabetes prevalence is approximately 21 %
among Asian Americans, nearly twice as high as in non-
Hispanic whites.8 Notably, Asian Americans have a lower
mean body mass index (BMI) than other racial and ethnic
groups, but are more likely to develop type 2 diabetes.8–11 The
high risk of diabetes among Asian Americans has been attrib-
uted to a combination of genetic,6 physiologic,6,12,13 and
environmental factors.14–16
Given the growing public health attention on the elevated
risk of type 2 diabetes among Asian Americans, the expecta-
tion is that clinicians would intensify efforts to appropriately
screen this population. However, a previous study demonstrat-
ed that the rate of undiagnosed diabetes among Asian Amer-
icans was almost three times as high as that in non-Hispanic
whites.8 This finding suggests that many Asian Americans
may not receive appropriate diabetes screening. To date, no
research has explicitly investigated this possibility.
We used 2012–2014 data from a large national survey to
examine whether Asian Americans are appropriately screened
for type 2 diabetes and to assess racial and ethnic disparities in
recommended diabetes screening between Asian Americans
and other adults. We also performed several analyses to inves-
tigate whether patient- or system-level factors may be potential
mediators of disparities in diabetes screening.

 METHODS
Study Design and Data Source. We analyzed pooled cross-
sectional data from the 2012–2014 Behavioral Risk Factor Sur-
veillance System (BRFSS), an annual nationally representative
telephone-based survey that collects information on the health-
related risk behaviors and preventive health practices of U.S.
residents.17 The survey is conducted in English or Spanish only.
The BRFSS includes a core module and optional modules that
are implemented on a state-by-state basis. We limited our sample
to 42 states and three U.S. territories that implemented the
optional Pre-Diabetes module at least once between 2012 and
2014, since this module contained information on our study’s
dependent variable (Online Appendix Table 1). We excluded
eight states that did not implement this module: California,
Colorado, Kansas, Montana, Nebraska, Oklahoma, Texas, and
Utah.
Study Variables. The dependent variable in our analysis was
self-reported receipt of diabetes screening (BHave you had a test
for high blood sugar or diabetes within the past 3 years?^). The
primary independent variable was self-reported race and ethnic-
ity, which was categorized in the BRFSS as non-Hispanic
white, non-Hispanic Asian American, non-Hispanic Pacific
Islander, non-Hispanic American Indian or Alaskan Native,
non-Hispanic black, Hispanic or Latino, non-Hispanic multira-
cial, or non-Hispanic other. For this analysis, we combined non-
Hispanic multiracial and non-Hispanic other adults into one
group, because national diabetes screening guidelines do not
specify recommendations for either of these groups.18–20
Study Population. Our study population included adults who
should be screened for type 2 diabetes based on the American
Diabetes Association (ADA) guidelines between 2012 and
2014. During each of these years, the ADA guidelines recom-
mended diabetes screening with a fasting blood sugar, hemo-
globin A1c, or oral glucose tolerance test every 3 years for all
adults aged ≥ 45 years and all adults aged < 45 years with a
BMI ≥ 25 kg/m2 who had at least one additional risk factor for
diabetes.18–20 We considered all adults aged < 45 years with a
BMI ≥ 25 kg/m2 to be eligible for diabetes screening, since
previous research suggests that the vast majority of overweight
and obese adults have at least one additional risk factor that
qualifies them for diabetes screening under the ADA guidelines
(e.g., racial/ethnic minority status, sedentary lifestyle, family
history, etc.).21 Please see the Online Appendix and Appendix
Table 2 for further details. We excluded adults who reported
having diabetes or pre-diabetes, since adults with these condi-
tions are managed differently from the general population under
ADA guidelines (i.e., more frequent testing).20
Among the 565,530 adults who met initial sample inclusion
criteria, we excluded 25,215 respondents (4.5 %) who reported
that they did not know (DK), were not sure (NS), or refused to
give an answer (R) to the diabetes screening question. Of these
excluded respondents, 274 were Asian American. We addition-
ally excluded 9170 respondents (1.6 %) who reported DK/NS/
R to the race/ethnicity question, as well as 5145 respondents
(0.9 %) who reported DK/NS/R for key covariates (education
category, routine check-up in the past 2 years, enrollment in a
health insurance plan, and having a usual source of care22). Our
final sample consisted of 526,000 respondents who were eligi-
ble for diabetes screening, including 9310 Asian Americans.
Statistical Analysis. We used survey-weighted descriptive sta-
tistics to characterize the demographic characteristics and
healthcare access of our sample, as well as to calculate the
weighted proportion of adults in each racial and ethnic group
who received recommended diabetes screening. We defined
disparities as the adjusted difference in recommended diabetes
screening between Asian Americans and other adults, assuming
that the distribution of important covariates between groups was
similar (referred to as the Bresidual direct effect^ approach).23 To
implement this definition, we fit multivariable logistic regression
models to assess receipt of diabetes screening as a function of
race and ethnicity (using non-Hispanic white as the referent
group), controlling for demographic variables (continuous age,
gender, education category, residence in a metropolitan area),
dichotomous healthcare access variables (routine check-up in the
past 2 years, enrollment in a health insurance plan, having a
usual source of care), survey year indicators, and state indicators.
We excluded annual household income from our main model
specifications because 13.9 % of our sample had missing data
for this variable, similar to prior studies using the BRFSS.24,25 In
sensitivity analyses, we found that results did not change sub-
stantially when we excluded individuals with missing income
data and adjusted for income, or when we adjusted for imputed
income in regression models (Online Appendix Table 3).
To further characterize patterns of racial and ethnic dispar-
ities in screening, we conducted subgroup analyses examining
whether the magnitude of disparities varied by age group (age
< 45 or age ≥ 45) and/or BMI category (normal weight or
underweight: BMI < 25 kg/m2; overweight: BMI 25.0–
29.9 kg/m2; obese: BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2). We also conducted
analyses to investigate potential mechanisms that might ex-
plain disparities in diabetes screening. To determine the role of
demographic characteristics and healthcare access, we re-
moved each covariate individually from regression models
and assessed for changes in the magnitude of the disparity.
Though we could not directly examine the role of patient
preference and attitudes toward healthcare, we conducted
three analyses that indirectly examined these factors. First,
we assessed racial and ethnic disparities in the receipt of other
forms of preventive screening, reasoning that similar dispar-
ities could suggest a general aversion to screening among
Asian Americans. Specifically, we assessed racial and ethnic
disparities in the receipt of lifetime breast cancer screening
among women aged ≥ 50 years and colorectal cancer screening
among all adults aged ≥ 50 years. We used age ≥ 50 years as the
cutoff for breast cancer screening for consistency across the two
424

 analyses, and because there is consensus among national guide-
lines that all women above this age should receive breast cancer
screening.26,27 Unlike our main analysis, this analysis assessed
all Asian Americans aged ≥ 50 years in the 2012–2014 BRFSS
and did not exclude individuals with diabetes or pre-diabetes,
because we were interested in comparing preventive cancer
screening rates to diabetes screening rates.
Second, we assessed racial and ethnic disparities in diabetes
screening among 1) adults aged ≥ 50 years who had ever
received colorectal cancer screening; 2) women aged ≥
50 years who had ever received breast cancer screening; and
3) women aged ≥ 50 who had ever received both colorectal
cancer and breast cancer screening. Since these screening tests
are logistically and technically more involved than diabetes
screening, we reasoned that individuals who completed these
tests would be unlikely to decline a minimally involved test
such as diabetes screening.
Finally, to examine the possibility that disparities in screening
may be driven by higher dissatisfaction or distrust of the
healthcare system, we assessed whether the magnitude of dis-
parities changed substantially when we additionally controlled
for patient satisfaction in regression models (BIn general, how
satisfied are you with the healthcare you received?^).28 Of note,
data on the patient satisfaction item were included in an optional
healthcare access module beginning in 2013. Thus, this analysis
included only the 277,844 respondents in our sample who were
asked this question in the 2013 and 2014 BRFSS.
In all analyses, we employed survey weights and design-
based variance estimators to account for the complex survey
design of the BRFSS. Data analysis was conducted using
STATA, version 13.1 (StataCorp LP, College Station, TX).
This study was exempted from review by the institutional
review board of the University of Chicago.
RESULTS
Our sample of 526,000 respondents represented 229.7 million
U.S. adults who were eligible for diabetes screening between
2012 and 2014, of whom 71.3 % were non-Hispanic whites
and 2.2 % were Asian Americans. Compared to non-Hispanic
whites, Asian Americans in our sample were younger, more
highly educated, more likely to be overweight, and less likely
to be obese (Table 1).
The weighted percentage of Asian American adults receiv-
ing recommended diabetes screening was 47.1 %, which was
lower than the percentage for non-Hispanic whites (59.2 %),
non-Hispanic Pacific Islanders (50.3 %), non-Hispanic Amer-
ican Indians or Alaskan Natives (55.6 %), non-Hispanic
blacks (60.2 %), Hispanics/Latinos (58.1 %), and adults clas-
sified as multiracial or other (58.8 %) (Table 2).
Compared to non-Hispanic whites, the adjusted odds of re-
ceiving recommended diabetes screening were significantly low-
er among Asian Americans in the overall sample (AOR = 0.66;
95 % CI: 0.60, 0.73; Table 2), in the subgroup of adults aged ≥
45 years (AOR = 0.58; 95 % CI: 0.51, 0.66), and in the subgroup
of adults aged < 45 years with a BMI ≥ 25 kg/m2 (AOR = 0.78;
95 % CI: 0.67, 0.90). In contrast, the adjusted odds of receiving
recommended diabetes screening were significantly higher
among non-Hispanic blacks and Hispanics/Latinos compared to
non-Hispanic whites in all analyses (Table 2). Results did not
change substantially when we removed each covariate individu-
ally from regression models to assess for changes in the magni-
tude of the disparity (Online Appendix Table 4).
We also assessed racial and ethnic disparities among sub-
groups defined by age and BMI category. Compared to non-
Hispanic whites, Asian Americans aged ≥ 45 years who were
underweight/normal weight, overweight, or obese were all
significantly less likely to receive recommended diabetes
screening; the magnitude of this disparity was greatest for
obese adults (AOR = 0.56; 95 % CI: 0.39, 0.81; Table 3).
Compared to non-Hispanic whites, obese Asian Americans
aged < 45 years were significantly less likely to receive rec-
ommended diabetes screening (AOR = 0.74; 95 % CI: 0.54,
0.999), but differences were not statistically significant for
overweight adults aged < 45 years (Table 3).
Compared to non-Hispanic whites, Asian Americans were
significantly less likely to report receiving colorectal cancer
screening (AOR = 0.60; 95 % CI: 0.53, 0.68), but this was not
true for breast cancer screening (Online Appendix Table 5).
Compared to non-Hispanic whites, the adjusted odds of receiv-
ing recommended diabetes screening remained significantly
lower among Asian Americans aged ≥ 50 years who had ever
received colorectal cancer screening (AOR = 0.59; 95 % CI:
0.47, 0.76), for Asian American women aged ≥ 50 years who
had ever received breast cancer screening (AOR = 0.62; 95 %
CI, 0.45, 0.84), and for Asian American women aged ≥ 50 years
who had ever received both colorectal and breast cancer
screening (AOR = 0.60; 95 % CI: 0.41, 0.88; Table 4). Among
individuals with patient satisfaction data, additionally control-
ling for patient satisfaction did not substantially change the
magnitude of the disparity (Online Appendix Table 6).
DISCUSSION
We found that less than half of Asian Americans received
recommended type 2 diabetes screening between 2012 and
2014. While screening was suboptimal in all racial and ethnic
groups, Asian Americans were by far the least likely group to
be appropriately screened. In regression models adjusting for
important demographic and healthcare access variables, Asian
Americans had 34 % lower odds of receiving recommended
diabetes screening compared to non-Hispanic whites. Our
findings suggest that inadequate screening among Asian
Americans may be an important driver of the high prevalence
of undiagnosed diabetes in this population.8
Our study provides evidence against several potential expla-
nations for the disparity in diabetes screening between Asian
425

JGIM
 Americans and other adults. First, the disparity is unlikely
driven by differences in clinical need, since our sample includ-
ed only individuals who should receive diabetes screening
according to ADA guidelines. Second, the disparity is unlikely
driven by differences in healthcare access or patient demo-
graphic factors (e.g., gender, insurance status), since estimates
of the disparity did not change substantially when we removed
these variables individually from regression analyses.
Our study does not provide strong support for the hypoth-
esis that differences in patient preference and attitudes toward
healthcare are the primary mediators of the observed disparity.
For example, while Asian Americans in our study reported
receiving less recommended colorectal cancer screening;26,29
this was not true for breast cancer screening. Additionally, we
also found that disparities in diabetes screening persisted
among Asian Americans who completed recommended breast
and/or colorectal cancer screening, both of which are logisti-
cally and technically more involved than diabetes screening.
This finding suggests that at least in this group of older adults,
the disparity is not likely to be driven by patient attitudes
toward screening. Finally, results did not change substantially
when we additionally controlled for patient satisfaction, which
has been associated with higher adherence to physician rec-
ommendations in prior studies.28
At least two additional possibilities remain. One possibility is
that Asian American patients may not recognize their elevated
risk for diabetes, and thus they request diabetes screening less
frequently than other racial and ethnic groups. A second possi-
bility is that clinicians may not adhere to evidence-based dia-
betes screening guidelines for Asian Americans,3 because cli-
nicians also fail to recognize the elevated risk of diabetes in this
population. Such a possibility would be consistent with previ-
ous work suggesting that the Bmodel minority myth^ and other
stereotypes may impede clinician recognition of common health
problems in Asian Americans (e.g., hypertension, dementia).30–
32 Similarly, clinicians may be less likely to recognize or re-
spond to obesity in Asian American patients compared to other
adults. In potential support of this hypothesis, we found that
among adults aged ≥ 45 years, the magnitude of the disparity in
diabetes screening was unexpectedly widest for obese adults.
Our findings have important implications for clinical prac-
tice. In 2015, the ADA changed its guidelines to recommend

 screening in all Asian American adults aged < 45 years with a
BMI ≥ 23 kg/m2 instead of 25 kg/m2.33 However, we demon-
strate that disparities were also substantial among older Asian
Americans, regardless of weight status. Thus, while the new
ADA screening guidelines and related public health cam-
paigns7 such as BScreen at 23^ are important in promoting
screening among younger Asian Americans, raising aware-
ness about screening in older Asian Americans may be equally
important.
We also note that the change in BMI cutoffs specified by the
2015 ADA guidelines also applied to Pacific Islanders, who are
often grouped together with Asian Americans due to common
biological and genetic factors.6,34 While our study focused on
Asian Americans and may have been underpowered for ana-
lyzing Pacific Islanders, we do note that the magnitude of
disparities was larger for Asian Americans than for Pacific
Islanders. This finding suggests that Asian Americans and
Pacific Islanders should not be combined in analyses of dispar-
ities, as doing so may mask important underlying differences.35
This study has several limitations. First, our dependent variable
was based on self-reported information and was not subject to
external validation. It is possible that some patients did not recall
or were not aware that they had received diabetes screening, and
as a result, we may have underestimated the proportion of adults
who received diabetes screening. However, for this bias to ex-
plain the observed disparity, the magnitude of bias would have to

 be very large and would impact Asian Americans substantially
more than other racial and ethnic groups. This is unlikely, since a
prior study found that recall bias in BRFSS survey items was
relatively uniform among racial and ethnic groups.36 Additional-
ly, we analyzed a sample of Asian Americans with high rates of
English fluency and controlled for education, a marker of health
literacy that could potentially affect the recall or recognition
diabetes screening.
Second, the Asian Americans in our sample had higher
educational attainment and English fluency than the general
Asian American population.5,37 Prior studies have shown that
higher educational attainment and language fluency are asso-
ciated with fewer barriers to healthcare and greater receipt of
recommended healthcare.38–40 Thus, in a more representative
sample of Asian Americans, with lower educational attain-
ment and poor English fluency, the magnitude of the disparity
could be even larger than we report.
Third, BRFSS data do not provide consistent information
regarding Asian American subgroups (e.g., Chinese, Filipino,
Vietnamese) or immigration status. Asian Americans are a
heterogeneous population, and more granular analyses be-
tween subgroups may reveal markedly different patterns in
healthcare. Finally, while our study is representative of 45 U.S.
states and territories, our sample did not include Texas or
California, two states containing a large proportion of the
U.S. Asian American population,5 including almost half of
all Asian American immigrants.41 Inclusion of these states
may have resulted in larger disparities in diabetes screening,
due to lower English fluency among immigrants.39 Alterna-
tively, it is possible that including these states may have
resulted in smaller disparities, due to higher awareness of
Asian American health issues.
CONCLUSIONS
In this study of 45 U.S. states and territories, we report that
Asian Americans are not adequately screened for type 2 dia-
betes, and receive recommended screening less frequently
than other racial and ethnic groups. Given the deleterious
health effects of delayed diagnosis and treatment of diabetes,
it is crucial that public health and clinical professionals im-
prove screening and diagnosis of diabetes in Asian Americans.
