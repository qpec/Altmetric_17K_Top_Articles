Abstract
Background: there are no previous studies linking repeated heat exposure of sauna and the risk of memory diseases. We
aimed to investigate whether frequency of sauna bathing is associated with risk of dementia and Alzheimer’s disease.
Setting: prospective population-based study.
Methods: the frequency of sauna bathing was assessed at baseline in the Kuopio Ischaemic Heart Disease population-
based prospective cohort study of 2,315 apparently healthy men aged 42–60 years at baseline, with baseline examinations
conducted between 1984 and 1989. Hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for dementia and Alzheimer’s
disease were ascertained using Cox-regression modelling with adjustment for potential confounders.
Results: during a median follow-up of 20.7 (interquartile range 18.1–22.6) years, a total of 204 and 123 diagnosed cases of
dementia and Alzheimer’s disease were respectively recorded. In analysis adjusted for age, alcohol consumption, body mass
index, systolic blood pressure, smoking status, Type 2 diabetes, previous myocardial infarction, resting heart rate and serum low-
density lipoprotein cholesterol, compared with men with only 1 sauna bathing session per week, the HR for dementia was 0.78
(95% CI: 0.57–1.06) for 2–3 sauna bathing sessions per week and 0.34 (95% CI: 0.16–0.71) for 4–7 sauna bathing sessions per
week. The corresponding HRs for Alzheimer’s disease were 0.80 (95% CI: 0.53–1.20) and 0.35 (95% CI: 0.14–0.90).
Conclusion: in this male population, moderate to high frequency of sauna bathing was associated with lowered risks of
dementia and Alzheimer’s disease. Further studies are warranted to establish the potential mechanisms linking sauna bathing
and memory diseases.

Introduction
Although there is a direct correlation between ageing and
the incidence of dementia, its risk factors and pathogenesis
are not fully understood and various possible preventive
strategies are still under investigation. A multifactorial aeti-
ology has been proposed and pathways notably implicated
include inflammation, haemodynamic and vascular function
[1, 2]. Evidence from observational studies suggests that
poor vascular function (as indicated by arterial stiffening) and
vascular diseases maybe associated with worse cognitive per-
formance and dementia [3–5]. Given this, there remains a pos-
sibility that improved circulatory function may be linked to
better cognitive outcomes. Sauna bathing, an activity linked to
relaxation and well-being, is associated with better haemo-
dynamic function, leads to skin sweating-induced fluid loss
and increase in heart rate [5, 6]; and has been suggested to be
associated with a better cardiovascular and circulatory func-
tion, especially among patients with chronic heart failure [7–
11]. Previous studies have also shown that heat exposure of
sauna bathing is associated with lower blood pressure [12,
13]; however, some of these reports were based on limited
study designs. We have recently shown that regular sauna
bathing is associated with reduced risks of fatal cardiovascular
diseases and all-cause mortality [14]. The relationship between
sauna bathing and dementia is however not known. Thus, the
aim of this prospective study was to investigate the association

 between frequency of sauna bathing and the risk of dementia
and Alzheimer’s disease.
Methods
Study population
This study was designed to investigate risk predictors for
atherosclerotic cardiovascular outcomes in a population-
based sample of men from eastern Finland. Subjects com-
prised a randomly selected sample of 3,433 men aged
42–60 years who resided in Kuopio or its surrounding rural
communities [15]. Of those invited, 2,682 (83%) partici-
pated in the study, and those with complete information on
sauna bathing were included (N = 2,327). Twelve men who
did not use sauna were excluded, leaving 2,315 men for the
analyses [14]. Baseline examinations were conducted between
March 1984 and December 1989. The study was approved
by the research ethics committee of the University of
Eastern Finland, Kuopio, Finland. Each participant gave
written informed consent.
Assessment of sauna bathing habits
A traditional Finnish sauna has dry air (10–20%) with rela-
tively high temperature. The recommended temperature for
sauna is usually from 80°C to 100°C at the level of the
bather’s face [16]. Humidity is temporarily increased by
throwing water on the hot rocks of sauna heater. The use
of sauna bathing was assessed by a self-administered ques-
tionnaire based on weekly sauna sessions, duration and
temperature. The assessment represents a typical sauna use
during the week. The temperature in sauna room was mea-
sured using a thermometer in and was also self-reported.
The questionnaires were checked by an experienced nurse
at the time of baseline examination [14].
Assessment of baseline characteristics
A subject was defined as a smoker if he had ever smoked on
a regular basis and pack-years were defined. Resting blood
pressure was measured between 8:00 and 10:00 AM with
a random-zero sphygmomanometer. Alcohol consumption
was assessed using the Nordic Alcohol Consumption
Inventory [17]. Body mass index (BMI) was calculated as the
ratio of weight in kilograms to the square of height in metres.
The collection of blood specimens and the measurement of
serum lipids, lipoproteins, creatinine and glucose have been
described previously [17]. Diabetes was defined as a fasting
blood glucose level ≥7.0 mmol/l or clinical diagnosis of dia-
betes with dietary, oral or insulin treatment. The use of medi-
cations, medical history and the level of physical activity were
assessed by self-administered questionnaires. Physical activity
(kcal/day) was computed by multiplying the duration and
intensity of each physical activity by body weight and was
assessed using a 12-month physical activity questionnaire
described in detail previously [17]. Briefly, this detailed quantita-
tive questionnaire deals with the most common leisure-time
physical activities of middle-aged Finnish men (conditioning
physical activity, e.g. walking, skiing, bicycling, swimming, row-
ing and ball games; and non-conditioning physical activity, e.g.
crafts, repairs, building, gardening, hunting and fishing) and
enables the assessment of all components of physical activity
[18]. Prevalent coronary heart disease was defined as either a
previous myocardial infarction, angina pectoris or the use of
nitroglycerin for chest pain once a week or more frequently.
Socio-economic status is a summary index that combines mea-
sures of income, education, occupation, occupational prestige,
material standard of living and housing conditions, all of which
were assessed with self-reported questionnaires [14].
Ascertainment of outcomes
All dementia and Alzheimer’s disease cases that occurred from
study enrolment through 2013 were included. There were no
losses to follow-up given the complete follow-up of the
Finnish population using personal identification codes. In
the Kuopio Ischemic Heart Disease risk factor study, par-
ticipants are under annual monitoring for incident dementia
cases and cardio-metabolic outcomes [14, 17]. Data on out-
come events were obtained by record linkage to the national
computerised hospitalisation registry, which covers every hos-
pitalisation in Finland. The diagnoses of memory diseases
were coded according to the International Classification of
Diseases Codes. In addition, sources of information on
dementia outcomes were also based on a comprehensive
review of hospital records, inpatient physician claims data
and medico-legal reports. An independent committee of
researchers reviewed all potential cases of dementia to obtain
a consensus on the diagnosis and aetiology.
Statistical analysis
For all analyses, natural logarithm (loge) transformed values
of non-normal distributed variables were used. Descriptive
data are presented as means (SDs) for continuous variables
and numbers (percentages) for categorical ones. Analyses of
the associations between sauna bathing, dementia and
Alzheimer’s
disease
involved
Cox-regression
modelling.
Hazard ratios (HRs) with confidence intervals (CIs) were
estimated per frequency of sauna bathing with adjustment
for potential confounders selected on the basis of their previ-
ously established role as risk factors [14]. Two-sided analyses
were performed using SPSS version 18.0 (IBM Corp.,
Armonk, NY, USA) and CIs are presented at the 95% level.
Results
Baseline characteristics of the study population are shown
in Table 1. During a median follow-up of 20.7 (interquartile
range 18.1–22.6) years, a total of 204 newly diagnosed
dementia and 123 Alzheimer’s disease cases were recorded;
only 4 dementia cases and 6 Alzheimer disease cases were
defined at time of death. Of all men with diagnosed out-
come events, 124 men with dementia and 67 men with

 Alzheimer’s disease died during the follow-up period,
respectively. A total of 601, 1,513 and 200 participants
reported having a sauna bath once a week, 2–3 times and
4–7 times per week, respectively. The numbers (proportions
in each group) of dementia cases were 59 (10%), 137 (9%)
and 8 (4%) respectively in the three frequency groups of
sauna bathing. The corresponding numbers (proportions)
of Alzheimer’s disease cases were 34 (6%), 84 (6%) and 5
(3%), respectively.
After adjustment for age, compared with men with only
1 sauna bathing session per week, the HR of dementia was
0.77 (95% CI: 0.57–1.04) for 2–3 sauna bathing sessions
per week and 0.38 (95% CI: 0.18–0.80) for 4–7 sauna bath-
ing sessions per week. The corresponding HRs for
Alzheimer’s disease were 0.80 (95% CI: 0.54–1.2) for 2–3
sauna bathing sessions per week and 0.41 (95% CI:
0.16–1.07) for 4–7 sauna bathing sessions per week.
In a multivariable analysis adjusted for baseline age, alco-
hol consumption, BMI, systolic blood pressure, smoking
status, Type 2 diabetes, previous myocardial infarction, rest-
ing heart rate and serum low-density lipoprotein cholesterol,
there was a 66% risk reduction (HR: 0.34) of dementia and
65% (HR: 0.35) risk reduction of Alzheimer’s disease when
sauna bathing 4–7 times a week was compared with subjects
having 1 sauna session per week (Table 2). After additional
adjustment for physical activity and socio-economic status,
the respective associations between sauna bathing and the
risk of memory diseases (HR 0.34, 95% CI: 0.16–0.71,
P = 0.004 for dementia and HR 0.35, 95% CI 0.16–0.90,
P = 0.029 for Alzheimer’s disease) remained similar for
men with 4–7 sauna bathing sessions per week.
Discussion
In this population-based study of middle-aged Finnish men,
we found a strong inverse association between frequency of
sauna bathing and the risk of dementia and Alzheimer’s dis-
ease, which was independent of known risk factors.
Although the pathogenesis of dementia has not been
completely elucidated, current evidence suggests a multi-
factorial aetiology, with impaired cardiovascular function,
inflammation and oxidative stress as being the major contri-
butors in its pathogenesis [4]. Our results are therefore bio-
logically plausible as regular sauna bathing is associated
with improved vascular endothelial function [8], which also
leads to reduced inflammation. Additionally, sauna bathing

 may be beneficial in the reduction of high systemic blood
pressure and elevated pulse pressure, which are also well-
known risk factors for dementia [12, 19]. Skin blood flow
usually increases leading to a higher cardiac output with an
increased body temperature during sauna bathing. Heart
rate may increase from 100 up to 150 beats per minute dur-
ing sauna bathing [13, 20, 21], although there is no active
function of skeletal muscles during the sauna bathing,
which is in contrast to the training response experienced
during physical activity. Indeed, it has been shown that
weight loss achieved during intense physical exercise is
more favourable in athletes than that achieved through the
effects of sauna [22]. The increase in heart rate during sau-
na bathing is due to reaction to the heat stress.
Overall, our results indicate that sauna bathing in add-
ition to being a relaxing lifestyle habit, remains a potential
additional strategy which can be used in improving cardio-
vascular function [4], and subsequently prevent or delay the
development of neurogenerative diseases such as dementia.
However, these results are still early and further studies are
needed to replicate these findings in different populations.
Strengths of the current study include the rigorous meas-
urement of baseline risk factors, the large and homogeneous
community-based sample and the long-term follow-up with-
out missing data on outcomes. The prospective nature of
our study done in apparently healthy individuals at baseline
also offsets some of the biases attributed to reverse causality.
We adjusted for a comprehensive panel of lifestyle and clin-
ical factors. There are limitations that deserve consideration.
Ascertainment of outcomes relied a lot on hospitalisation dis-
charge codes, potentially missing cases that would have seen
on an outpatient basis only. However, this is unlikely
given that information on outcomes was also retrieved
from a comprehensive review of hospital records, inpatient
physician claims data and medico-legal reports. In addition,
owing to the complete follow-up system of the Finnish
population using personal identity codes, there were no
losses to follow-up. We acknowledge that the generalisation
of our findings is limited by the study population, which con-
sisted of middle-aged Finnish men; these results should be
confirmed in other groups including different age groups,
other nationalities and women. Our results based on
Finnish sauna bathing with an average temperature of 80°
C, cannot be directly applied to steam rooms and hot tubs,
which may operate at a lower temperature than a typical
Finnish sauna [14]. Though many potential confounders
were measured and adjusted for to ensure the validity of
our key results, there remains potential for residual con-
founding as with all observational studies. It is possible
that underlying diagnosed or undiagnosed diseases may
have effect on sauna bathing habits. However, we adjusted
for key covariates such as prevalent histories of diabetes
and coronary heart disease to minimise these biases.
We did not have data on repeat assessments of sauna
habits to enable us to assess the long-term associations
(i.e. correction for regression dilution). We had only a one-
time questionnaire-based assessment of the frequency and
duration of sauna bathing during a typical week. While there
is a possibility that our assessment based on baseline mea-
surements could under-estimate the association between sau-
na habits and risk of dementia; this may not be considerable
given that we used average sauna habits based on weekly sau-
na sessions. It is possible that sauna bathing habits might
have changed during follow-up due to probable changes in
health habits or other disease of participants occurring over
the long period of time, which may have introduced some
biases in our results. However, it is unlikely that this would
have any considerable effect on the main findings, given
that sauna bathing is a tradition and embedded in the cul-
ture in Finland and accessible for almost everyone.
Secondly, we adjusted for several relevant confounders.
Third, given that sauna bathing is a commonly used relax-
ing habit in the Finnish population, this suggests that the
correlation between measured sauna habits taken several
years apart is anticipated to be high and therefore analysis
using baseline assessments is unlikely to considerably
under-estimate the associations. Nevertheless, our results
should still be interpreted with caution.
In conclusion, this report provides promising results from
the first prospective study that shows sauna bathing to be a
potential protective lifestyle factor for common memory dis-
eases in middle-aged Finnish men. Our results suggest that
sauna bathing, an activity which promotes relaxation and
well-being, may be a recommendable intervention to prevent
or delay the development of memory diseases in healthy
adults.
However,
well-designed
intervention
studies
are
needed to confirm our results in different population settings.
Key points
• Regular sauna bathing is suggested to be protective of fatal
cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality. However, the
association with risk of dementia has not been previously
investigated.
• There is a strong inverse association between regular sauna
bathing habits and the risk of dementia and Alzheimer’s
disease in middle-aged Finnish men.
• Sauna bathing, an activity that promotes relaxation and
well-being, may be a recommendable intervention to pre-
vent or delay the development of memory diseases in
healthy adults. Further study is however needed.
