 Cognitive decline refers to a wide continuum of changes in
cognitive function across the life course, including both age-
related decline and pathological decline.1 Poor cognitive status,
even in the absence of clinical dementia, is perhaps the single
most disabling condition in old age. Dementia is a syndrome
characterised by impairment of multiple cognitive capacities that
are severe enough to interfere with daily functioning. It is often
preceded by mild cognitive impairment, defined as ‘cognitive
impairment short of dementia’ or as ‘a transitional state between
normal cognition and dementia’.2 It is estimated that pathological
changes that lead to dementia start as early as several decades
before clinical diagnosis.3,4 An effective cure for dementia remains
elusive and given high and rising treatment and care costs,
knowledge about early modifiable risk factors may be important
from
a
public
health
perspective.
Importantly,
unhealthy
behaviours may accelerate cognitive decline and be amenable to
low-cost intervention at a population level.5 In the UK, cigarette
smoking and heavy alcohol consumption remain prevalent,
including among older adults.6
Several studies have found an association between smoking
and cognitive decline7–9 and dementia.8 Earlier studies apparently
suggesting a protective effect of smoking10,11 were later attributed
to selection bias.12 Evidence concerning alcohol use as a risk factor
for cognitive decline and dementia is also mixed. There may be
non-linear associations between alcohol and cognitive outcomes.
For example, a meta-analysis found lower risk of dementia in
people who were moderate (for example up to 14 units per week
for women and up to 21 units per week for men) but not heavy
drinkers compared with non-drinkers.13 Smoking and heavier
alcohol consumption often co-occur14 and their combined effect
on cognition may be larger than the sum of their individual
effects. In combination they have been associated with greater risk
of all-cause mortality in an occupational cohort in West Scotland15
and with aerodigestive cancer risk in a meta-analytic study.16 To
date few studies have examined the combined effect of smoking
and alcohol use on cognitive decline. In two early cross-sectional
studies of community-dwelling older adults in the USA (age 60–84),
one found no greater combined effect17 and the other found
general cognitive function to be 6% lower among those who
smoked and drank alcohol heavily compared with all other
groups.18 An earlier study of older adults in the USA (age 65
and older) found no separate effects but did not test for a possible
interaction.19 A later study in Finland found more frequent (v.
never or infrequent) alcohol use in midlife was associated with
better cognitive performance 21 years later (at age 65–79), which
was stronger among non-smokers.20
The evidence from studies on older populations on the
combined effect of alcohol and smoking on the risk of cognitive
function,17,18,20
cognitive
decline,19,21
or
later
Alzheimer’s
disease12,22 is inconsistent. An added complication is that older
smokers are a selected population.9 As cognitive decline is evident
in midlife,3 the aim of our study was to examine whether cigarette
smoking and alcohol consumption interact to accelerate cognitive
decline in the transition from midlife to early old age.
Method
Study population
The Whitehall II cohort was established in 1985/88 among 10 308
British civil servants.23 All civil servants aged 35–55 years in 20
London-based departments were invited to participate by letter,
and 73% agreed (67% men). Cognitive testing was introduced
in 1997/99 (the baseline for our analysis) during a clinical

Background
Identifying modifiable risk factors for cognitive decline may
inform prevention of dementia.
Aims
To examine the combined impact of cigarette smoking and
heavy alcohol consumption on cognitive decline from midlife.
Method
Prospective cohort study (Whitehall II cohort) with three
clinical examinations in 1997/99, 2002/04 and 2007/09.
Participants were 6473 adults (72% men), mean age 55.76
years (s.d. = 6.02) in 1997/99. Four cognitive tests, assessed
three times over 10 years, combined into a global z-score
(mean 0, s.d. = 1).
Results
Age-related decline in the global cognitive score was faster
in individuals who were smoking heavy drinkers than in
non-smoking moderate alcohol drinkers (reference group). The
interaction term (P=0.04) suggested that the combined effects
of smoking and alcohol consumption were greater than their
individual effects. Adjusting for age, gender, education and
chronic diseases, 10-year decline in global cognition was
70.42 z-scores (95% CI 70.45 to 70.39) for the reference
group. In individuals who were heavy alcohol drinkers who
also smoked the decline was 70.57 z-scores (95% CI 70.67
to 70.48); 36% faster than the reference group.
Conclusions
Individuals who were smokers who drank alcohol heavily
had a 36% faster cognitive decline, equivalent to an age-
effect of 2 extra years over 10-year follow-up, compared with
individuals who were non-smoking moderate drinkers.

2007/09,23 providing
a
follow-up
period
of
10 years. All
participants provided written consent and the University College
London ethics committee approved the study.
Measures
Covariates were drawn from the 1997/99 wave: age, gender,
educational attainment (none or lower primary school, lower
secondary school, higher secondary school, university, higher
university degree), chronic disease up to and including baseline
(physician diagnosed cancer, coronary heart disease, stroke
excluding transient ischaemic attack, diabetes) and a vocabulary
score. Coronary heart disease was ascertained based on clinically
verified events, including myocardial infarction and definite
angina. Information on stroke events was obtained both from
self-reports, and from 1989, hospital episode statistics records.
Diabetes was defined as having fasting glucose 57.0 mmol/l or
a 2 h postload glucose 511.1 mmol/l using a 75 g oral glucose
tolerance test.24 The Mill Hill Vocabulary Test consists of 33
stimulus words ordered by increasing difficulty and has six
response choices.25
Data on cigarette smoking and alcohol consumption were
obtained from questionnaires in 1985/88 (recruitment), 1991/93,
1997/99 (baseline cognitive assessment), 2002/04 and 2007/09.
Participants were asked about their alcohol consumption in the
past 7 days (measures of spirits, glasses of wine, pints of beer).
They were classified as non-drinkers (0 units of alcohol per week),
moderate drinkers (1–14 units a week for women or 1–21 units
per week for men) or heavy drinkers (414 units per week for
women and 421 units per week for men).26 Smoking status
was classified as current smoker, ex-smoker or never smoker.
The cognitive test battery comprised four cognitive tests and
was administered at three clinical examinations over 10 years
(1997/99, 2002/04 and 2007/09).
(a) The Alice Heim 4-I (AH4-I) is composed of a series of
65 verbal and mathematical reasoning items of increasing
difficulty to be completed in 10 min.27
(b) Short-term verbal memory was assessed with a 20-word free
recall test. Participants were presented with a list of 20 one-
or two-syllable words at 2 s intervals and then had to recall
them in writing in 2 min.
(c) There were two tests of verbal fluency.28 Participants were
asked to recall in writing as many ‘S’ words (phonemic
fluency) and as many animal names as they could (semantic
fluency) in 1 min.
The four cognitive tests were combined to create a global
cognitive z-score (mean 0, s.d.= 1), using the mean and standard
deviations from 1997/99 for standardisation, providing that
participants had completed at least two tests. Previous research
has used global scores constructed in this manner to minimise
problems due to measurement error on the individual tests.29
From 2002/04, the battery additionally included the Mini-
Mental State Examination (MMSE),30 used to identify possible
cases of cognitive impairment.31
Statistical analysis
We used latent growth curve models32 (also known as random-
effects
models)
to
examine
both
the
cross-sectional
and
longitudinal association between individuals who were smokers
(v. never smokers), ex-smokers (v. never smokers), heavy (v.
moderate) or abstinent (v. moderate) alcohol users, and their
interactions, and the global cognitive score. Latent growth curve
models acknowledge that repeated
measures on the same
individual are correlated, and allow participants with incomplete
follow-up data to be included in the analysis. Both the intercept
and the slope are fitted as random effects, allowing each to vary
between individuals, but without conditioning the slope on the
baseline score.33 We divided participants’ time scores (in years)
by 10 so that coefficients describe cognitive decline over 10 years.
A model containing the alcohol consumption and smoking status
variables (and covariates) and their product terms (alcohol
consumption6smoking status) was compared with a nested model
that only contained the exposure variables (and covariates), using a
likelihood ratio test (a test of global interaction, also known as the
chi-squared difference test) separately for the intercepts and slopes.
Older adults experience faster cognitive decline,3 allowing us to
compare the effect of being in a particular ‘alcohol consumption6
smoking status’ group with the effect of being 1 year older, providing
information about clinical significance. The two effect sizes were
compared using the formula (Bgroup/Bone year older = age effect).
The linear dose–response association between alcohol units
and cigarettes was evaluated among males who were cigarette
smokers and heavy drinkers respectively, given low statistical
power among females who were smokers. To normalise the skewed
distribution, alcohol units were natural log transformed (constant
added) and consumption fitted using log units together with an
intercept term indicating alcohol use v. non-use.34 The number
of cigarettes smoked could not be normalised by transformation
and was therefore grouped into 1–10, 11–20, 21+ cigarettes per
day (v. none) to match clear peaks in the distribution at 10 and
20 cigarettes per day.
Several sensitivity analyses were performed. First, we repeated
analyses among participants with an MMSE score of 24 or more31
in 2002/04 and 2007/09 to ensure that results were not driven by
possible cases of cognitive impairment. Second, we additionally
adjusted results for the highest Mill Hill Vocabulary Test score
obtained, to evaluate the impact of possible reverse causation.35
Since vocabulary is resistant to cognitive decline,9 it is often used
as a measure of premorbid cognitive function. Third, we
calculated a cumulative risk score for smoking, alcohol and their
interaction from recruitment to baseline (1985/88, 1991/93 and
1997/99); to evaluate whether previous cumulative exposure was
also associated with cognitive function and decline. Fourth, we
evaluated the impact of behaviour change on results by excluding
participants who changed their behaviour after baseline in 1997/
99 (smokers who had stopped smoking or heavy alcohol drinkers
who no longer drank heavily in 2002/04 and 2007/09). Fifth, we
repeated the models after excluding participants who were very
heavy drinkers (435 units per week)26 and heavy smokers
(420 cigarettes per day) at the same time, to evaluate their impact
on results. Sixth, we added a term (male6smoking status) to the
model to capture the previously reported association between
current smoking and cognitive decline observed in men only,9
to confirm results were consistent. Seventh, we repeated the
models on each of the four cognitive tests, to evaluate whether
patterns differed for memory compared with tests that involve
executive function (reasoning, semantic and phonemic fluency).
Eighth, we repeated the analysis on a nested sample of participants
with complete data from baseline to follow-up. Similar results
among those with complete v. missing data would provide
evidence against a healthy-survivor effect. Finally, we also
compared models including participants reporting no alcohol
use in the past 7 days but regular use at other times (occasional
drinkers) with those reporting no use at other times (non-
drinkers), to evaluate whether heterogeneity in the ‘0 alcohol units
per week’ group influenced our findings.

Impact of smoking and heavy alcohol use on cognitive decline

Results
The analytic sample comprised 6473 participants (4635 men) with
data on cigarette smoking, alcohol units, covariates and global
cognition for at least one examination. Of the analytic sample,
68.4% had three waves of cognitive data and 19.3% had two
waves. Compared with the Whitehall II study population at
recruitment (1985/88, n= 10 308) those excluded were slightly
older (mean 44.8 v. 44.2 years in 1985–88, P50.001), more likely
to be female (41.1% v. 28.4%, P50.001), more likely to smoke
(24.7% v. 14.8%, P50.001) and less likely to drink alcohol heavily
(14.6% v. 16.3%, P50.001). Table 1 presents characteristics of the
participants included in the analysis, showing that individuals
who were current smokers were more likely to drink alcohol
heavily.
Growth curve models to estimate the combined effect of
alcohol consumption and smoking status at baseline (1997/99)
on global cognitive score over follow-up (2002/04 and 2007/09)
were fitted with adjustment for age, gender, prevalent chronic
disease and educational attainment. These models showed a
significant interaction between smoking status and alcohol
consumption, both for the intercept (cognitive function at
baseline, w2(4) = 20.83, P40.001) and the slope (cognitive decline
over 10 years, w2(4) = 9.99, P= 0.04).
In order to estimate the combined effect of each alcohol6
smoking status group, the model was re-parameterised and fitted
using eight dummy variables that compared each alcohol6smoking
status group with the largest group used as the reference
group (never smoker, moderate alcohol drinker). This enabled
estimation of the cognitive outcomes in each group in terms of
cognition function in 1997/99 (intercept) and cognitive decline
during the follow-up (slope). Table 2 shows the estimated mean
intercept and slope for each alcohol6smoking status group
(coefficients for the alternative parameterisation are shown in
online Table DS1, and for all groups in online Table DS2).
Compared with those who were never smokers and consumed a
moderate amount of alcohol, participants reporting no alcohol
consumption in the previous 7 days generally had worse cognitive
function at baseline. Moderate drinkers who were current smokers
also had a significantly lower baseline cognitive function. In
general, estimated cognitive function at baseline was higher as
alcohol consumption increased.
In analysis of cognitive decline (expressed as the change in
cognitive function over 10 years), only one group differed
significantly from the reference group of never smokers and
moderate alcohol users. In individuals who were current smokers
and who were also heavy drinkers, cognitive decline was 36%
faster than the reference group. Cognitive decline in this group
was
equivalent
to
an
age
effect
of
12
years
(70.153/
70.013 = 12), 2 years faster than in those who were non-smoking
moderate drinkers (an age effect of 2 extra years over 10-year
follow-up). Figure 1 shows both the baseline cognitive function
(intercept) and the cognitive decline trajectory (slope) for the
‘current smoker, heavy drinker’ group compared with the total
sample.
Among those reporting alcohol consumption, we observed a
linear dose–response association between log alcohol units and
10-year cognitive decline among the male smokers group
(Bslope = 70.12, 95% CI 70.20 to 70.04, P= 0.004). Cognitive
decline was faster as the number of alcohol units increased (online
Fig. DS1).
Among males who were heavy alcohol drinkers, cigarette
smoking (v. never smoking) was associated with significantly

(Bslope= 70.15, 95% CI 70.37 to 0.08, P= 0.21) (online Fig. DS2).
Results from sensitivity analyses are summarised in Table 3
These did not influence the conclusions drawn from the
main analysis materially. For the ‘non-smoker, 0 alcohol units
per week’ group, effect sizes were similar for non-drinkers and
occasional drinkers (17% v. 19% faster than the reference group
respectively).
Discussion
This study of over 6000 adults aged 45–69 years at the start of
cognitive
testing
examined
cigarette
smoking
and
alcohol
consumption as predictors of cognitive decline assessed three
times over 10 years. The combined effect of cigarette smoking
and heavy alcohol consumption accelerated cognitive decline over
the 10-year follow-up period. Cognitive decline was 36% faster in
those who reported both cigarette smoking and drinking alcohol
above the recommended limits at baseline, this effect was
equivalent to an age effect of an additional 2 years over 10-year
follow-up. The pattern was strongest for tests requiring executive
function; that is reasoning, semantic and phonemic fluency.
Strengths and limitations
The large sample size, long follow-up period and multiple waves
of cognitive assessment strengthen confidence in the results.
Several known confounding factors were controlled for in the
analysis. Combining four tests into a single measure of global
cognition can reduce measurement error. There are some
limitations to our study. First, participants reporting 0 alcohol
units per week in the past 7 days were a heterogeneous group
comprising occasional drinkers, lifetime abstainers, those with
existing morbidity (including ‘sick quitters’) and those not
drinking alcohol for other reasons. ‘Sick quitters’ may account
partly for the significantly higher levels of chronic disease
observed in those reporting 0 alcohol units per week (online Table
DS3). It is also possible that symptoms of prodromal cognitive
decline may have motivated participants to stop drinking
alcohol. This makes it difficult to determine any protective effect
of non-drinking, because this group contains some previously
heavy drinkers and a high prevalence of chronic disease. However,
effect sizes were similar among occasional and non-drinkers.
Second, because all participants were white collar workers, results
may not generalise to manual occupations or to the unemployed.
However, the cohort covers a wide socioeconomic range, with a
tenfold difference in full-time salary between the highest and
lowest occupational grade.
Comparison to other studies
Previous studies evaluating the combined impact of cigarette
smoking and alcohol use on risk of cognitive decline or dementia
have focused on older adults,2,20,21,35,36 often with smaller sample
sizes and have tended to be cross-sectional20 or case–control
studies of Alzheimer’s disease,12,21,22 few of which have been
longitudinal.21,22 Previous studies have also suggested that tobacco
and alcohol may modify each other’s effects on Alzheimer’s
disease,12,22 although these studies did not distinguish moderate
from heavy alcohol drinkers. We studied longitudinally the

 Hagger-Johnson et al
combined effect of both behaviours from midlife to early old age
on both cognitive function and decline.
There is now consistent evidence to suggest that studies based
on elderly people have selection bias because of the greater
mortality among smokers, producing a selected group of older
smokers.37 Although our study followed participants from
midlife, we found some evidence for a healthy survivor effect over
follow-up. It is therefore likely that we underestimated the
combined effect of smoking and heavy alcohol drinking on
cognitive decline, owing to greater mortality among smokers
and heavy alcohol drinkers. The findings presented here extend
our previous report that smoking in men is associated with faster
cognitive decline over 10 years (online Table DS4).9
Meaning of the study
It is important to know whether the effects of smoking and
alcohol use combine to increase risk of cognitive decline in
early old age, since this may offer opportunities for prevention.
Strategies designed to encourage adults to stop smoking could
be
implemented
sequentially
with
other
behaviour
change
interventions,
such
as
using
smoking
cessation
to
begin
discussions
about
other
risky
behaviours.
Preventable
risk
factors that co-occur could potentially offer a double dividend,
since removal of either risk factor can remove the excess risk
associated with the risk factor and the excess risk associated
with
the
interaction.34
However,
the
particularly
strong
combined effect we demonstrate here should not detract from
concerns about the separate impact of unhealthy behaviours,8,13
particularly smoking,9 but additionally shows the importance of
looking at how the effects of behaviours may combine.
Future research should identify reasons why combining these
two behaviours accelerates cognitive decline. Studies could look
at cumulative damage to aerodigestive or vascular pathways and
any subsequent association with cognitive decline. In terms of
public health recommendations, guidelines already exist about
smoking and drinking alcohol within recommended levels26 but
these could be modified to emphasise excess risk from combined
behaviours.
Implications
From a public health perspective, the increasing burden associated
with cognitive ageing could be reduced if lifestyle risk factors can
be modified.8 We concur with Anttila et al38 that people should
not drink more heavily in the belief that alcohol is a protective
factor against cognitive decline. Our findings, assuming the
observed associations are causal, show that alcohol use and
cigarette smoking do not appear to ‘cancel each other out’.22 Their
combined
effect
appears
to
accelerate
cognitive
decline.
Individuals who smoke should stop or cut down, and avoid heavy
alcohol drinking, consistent with existing advice. Adults should
additionally be advised however, not to combine these two
unhealthy behaviours, particularly from midlife onwards.

The interaction is apparently specific
to executive function
Healthy survivor effects
during follow-up
Repeat results on nested sample
of participants with complete
data during follow-up
Cognitive decline slightly faster in
the combined heavy drinker,
current smoker group

The combined effect of current smoking
and heavy alcohol drinking on decline
may be underestimated, as a result of
healthy survivor effects from baseline
to end of follow-up
MMSE, Mini-Mental State Examination; N/A, not applicable.
a. Effect represents the 100 ([decline in the ‘current smoker, heavy alcohol drinker’ group – decline in the ‘never smoker, moderate alcohol drinker’ group]/decline in the ‘never
smoker, moderate alcohol drinker’ group).
b. These models are not comparable with others shown in the table because the exposures were parameterised as interaction terms rather than groups.
