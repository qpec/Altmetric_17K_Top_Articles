Zika virus (ZIKV) is an emerging mosquito-borne flavivirus of signif-
icant public health concern. ZIKV shares a high degree of sequence
and structural homology compared with other flaviviruses, including
dengue virus (DENV), resulting in immunological cross-reactivity.
Improving our current understanding of the extent and characteris-
tics of this immunological cross-reactivity is important, as ZIKV is
presently circulating in areas that are highly endemic for dengue. To
assess the magnitude and functional quality of cross-reactive im-
mune responses between these closely related viruses, we tested
acute and convalescent sera from nine Thai patients with PCR-
confirmed DENV infection against ZIKV. All of the sera tested were
cross-reactive with ZIKV, both in binding and in neutralization. To
deconstruct the observed serum cross-reactivity in depth, we also
characterized a panel of DENV-specific plasmablast-derived monoclo-
nal antibodies (mAbs) for activity against ZIKV. Nearly half of the 47
DENV-reactive mAbs studied bound to both whole ZIKV virion and
ZIKV lysate, of which a subset also neutralized ZIKV. In addition, both
sera and mAbs from the dengue-infected patients enhanced ZIKV
infection of Fc gamma receptor (FcγR)-bearing cells in vitro. Taken
together, these findings suggest that preexisting immunity to DENV
may impact protective immune responses against ZIKV. In addition,
the extensive cross-reactivity may have implications for ZIKV viru-
lence and disease severity in DENV-experienced populations.
Zika virus | cross-reactivity | antibodies | B-cell responses
Z
ika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito-borne virus belonging to the
Flaviviridae family of single-stranded positive-sense RNA
viruses. First isolated in Uganda in 1947 (1), this virus remained
largely dormant for the next six decades until it reemerged as the
cause of an epidemic on Yap Islands, Micronesia in 2007 (2).
ZIKV has since then been linked with several outbreaks in the
Pacific and Americas, along with sporadic human cases in Africa
and Asia (3, 4). Until its appearance in French Polynesia in 2013
and more recently in Brazil in 2015, ZIKV infection was primarily
associated with mild self-limiting illness, with symptoms similar to
and often milder than dengue virus (DENV) or Chikungunya virus
(CHIKV) infections (2–4). However, the more recent outbreaks
have caused severe neurological complications including Guillain–
Barré Syndrome in adults and an increase in congenital micro-
cephaly and other adverse birth outcomes in Brazil (5–7). The Pan
American Health Organization has reported that as of May 2016,
local transmission of ZIKV had spread to over 38 countries or
territories in the Americas. In addition, a recent WHO report
states that 44 new countries are experiencing their first ZIKV
outbreak since 2015. Despite the improving surveillance of the
virus, accurate diagnosis has been challenging given the similari-
ties in the clinical presentation of ZIKV to other arboviral infec-
tions endemic in these regions, among other factors.
During the viremic period, ZIKV can be found in patient blood,
saliva, urine, and other bodily fluids early after symptom onset
(8–10). During the Yap Islands epidemic in 2007, anti-ZIKV IgM
ELISAs and ZIKV plaque reduction neutralization titer (PRNT)
assays were performed to confirm infection in RT-PCR negative
cases (2, 8). However, as these studies showed, the cross-reactivity
between ZIKV and other flaviviruses makes confirmation of in-
fection difficult, especially when patients may have had flavivirus
exposures before their suspected ZIKV infection (2, 8). Given the
overlapping presence of DENV and other flaviviruses in a ma-
jority of ZIKV epidemic regions (11), there are great challenges in
serology-based testing of flavivirus-immune patients (12).
The DENV envelope (E) protein, considered a major imuno-
dominant target for antibody responses in dengue patients (13–
15), bears greater than 50% homology to ZIKV E protein (16).
In addition to complicating the serology-based diagnosis of
ZIKV infection, this raises an interesting question about the
biological implications of the cross-reactivity on protection, vir-
ulence, and immunopathology of ZIKV infections. At present,
the effect of preexisting immunity to DENV or other flaviviruses
on immune responses induced by ZIKV infection is unknown.
To this end, we were interested in determining the degree to
Significance
In this study, we address the issue of cross-reactivity between
dengue virus (DENV) and Zika virus (ZIKV) by testing sera and
plasmablast-derived monoclonal antibodies from dengue pa-
tients against ZIKV. We show that both acute and convalescent
dengue sera potently bind and neutralize ZIKV and that this
cross-reactivity is also evident at the monoclonal level. We also
demonstrate in vitro antibody-dependent enhancement of ZIKV
infection in the presence of dengue-induced antibodies. Our
findings strongly suggest that preexisting dengue antibodies
may modulate immune responses to ZIKV infection. These data
are timely and highly relevant from a public health standpoint
given that a majority of regions currently experiencing Zika virus
epidemics are endemic for dengue.

 which dengue-induced antibodies cross-react with ZIKV in terms
of binding, virus neutralization, and antibody-dependent en-
hancement (ADE) of ZIKV infection, both at the serum and
single-cell level.
In this study, we provide an analysis of the cross-reactivity of acute
and convalescent dengue-immune sera against ZIKV. The sera were
collected from nine patients admitted to Siriraj Hospital in Bangkok,
Thailand with confirmed DENV infection. Both acute and conva-
lescent sera showed high binding titers to ZIKV lysate and could also
neutralize ZIKV in vitro. To understand the origin and character-
istics of these cross-reactive serum responses, we also analyzed a
panel of plasmablast-derived DENV-reactive monoclonal antibodies
(mAbs). Of the 47 mAbs tested, nearly half (22/47) bound to ZIKV
lysate and an additional four to the whole virus. Seven of these mAbs
also neutralized ZIKV in vitro. Five sera and a subset of the mAbs
were also tested for ADE activity using the FcγR-bearing monocytic
U937 cell line. All sera and ZIKV-reactive mAbs tested enhanced
infection in vitro, whereas two DENV-specific but ZIKV-nonreactive
mAbs did not. The data presented here have important impli-
cations for clinical diagnosis given that the current ZIKV out-
break in the Americas and the Caribbean is largely ongoing in
dengue-endemic areas. Equally important, these findings set the
stage for more in-depth studies that explore how preexisting fla-
vivirus immunity may shape immune responses to ZIKV infection.
Results
Sera from DENV-Infected Patients Are Highly Cross-Reactive to ZIKV
Lysate. A recently published study reported high structural sim-
ilarity between the E proteins of ZIKV and other flaviviruses in-
cluding DENV (16). We compared the ZIKV and DENV2 strains
used in our study, ZIKV PRVABC59 and DENV2 Tonga/74, to
determine the homology between their E proteins and identify
potential targets for cross-reactive immune responses. The DENV2
and ZIKV E proteins share an extremely similar, superimposable
structure (rmsd 1.1 Å; Fig. 1 A and B), with an overall 53.9%
amino acid sequence identity (Fig. S1 A and C). E domain I (EDI)
and EDII exhibit slightly higher conservation (59.1% and 56.6%
identity, respectively), including the fusion loop of EDII, which is
perfectly conserved between the two proteins (Fig. S1 B and C). To
assess the degree of cross-reactivity of DENV-specific B-cell re-
sponses against ZIKV, mock- and ZIKV-infected Vero cell lysates
were generated for use in binding assays. The lysates were tested by
Western blot and probed for the presence of E protein using the
mouse pan-flavivirus antibody 4G2. A band consistent with the size
of ZIKV E protein was observed in ZIKV lysate and absent in the
mock lysate (Fig. 2A). We then measured binding of both acute
and convalescent dengue sera, as well as naive sera, using the
ZIKV lysate by IgG ELISA (Fig. 2 B and C and Table S1).
The nine dengue patients in this study were all confirmed for
DENV infection by RT-PCR. Serum samples were collected once
during the acute phase (n = 9) and, for five patients, a second time
at convalescence (n = 5) (Table S1). Sera from two flavivirus-naïve
donors were also included in our analyses as a comparison with
dengue sera (Table S1). All 14 dengue serum samples showed high
ZIKV-specific IgG endpoint dilution titers, with median values of
177,400 and 125,000 for acute and convalescent samples, re-
spectively (Fig. 2 B and C and Table S1). All of the sera showed
negligible titers against mock lysate (endpoint dilution < 250). The
flavivirus-naïve samples were essentially negative against both the
ZIKV-infected and the mock lysates (Fig. 2C and Table S1).
These data illustrate that ZIKV cross-reactive antibodies can be
readily detected in the serum of dengue patients living in a highly
dengue-endemic country like Thailand.

 (FRNTs) on all 14 dengue sera against ZIKV. A representative
example of the ZIKV neutralization assay with two acute dengue
sera (#33 and #39) and one flavivirus-naïve serum sample (#21)
is shown in Fig. 3A. The ZIKV FRNT50 titers of the acute dengue
samples ranged from 60 (#60) to 23,109 (#79), with a median
value of 770. The convalescent dengue sera ranged in FRNT50
titers from 126 (#60R) to 50,346 (#79R), with a median titer of
350. Although neutralization titers increased between the acute
and convalescent bleeds for three patients, convalescent titers for
patients 55 and 67 were lower than their acute titers (Fig. 3B and
Table S1). Of note, the convalescent samples for these two donors
were obtained at a much later time point after fever onset (61–100 d)
than the other three convalescent sera (Table S1). These data
show that dengue-immune sera can neutralize ZIKV in vitro.
The impact of these neutralizing titers on either protective
immunity or disease severity after ZIKV infection remains to
be defined.
mAbs Derived from Dengue-Induced Plasmablasts Are Highly Cross-
Reactive to ZIKV. Although analysis of polyclonal sera from the
dengue patients clearly illustrates ample cross-reactivity of den-
gue-immune sera against ZIKV, serum analyses alone cannot
determine the origin of these cross-reactive antibodies. In other
words, whether the serum cross-reactivity was caused by two
individual pools of antibodies, one DENV-specific and the other
ZIKV-specific, or by antibodies that recognize both viruses can
only be conclusively determined by analyzing functional cross-
reactivity at the monoclonal level. To dissect the cross-reactivity
between DENV infection-induced antibodies and ZIKV, we
characterized the binding and neutralization activity of a panel of
plasmablast-derived mAbs against ZIKV. These mAbs were
generated from in vivo-activated, single cell-sorted plasmablasts
isolated during ongoing infection from four DENV2 patients and
were previously shown to be DENV-reactive either in binding or
in both binding and neutralization (13).
Of the 47 mAbs tested, 22 bound with high affinity to ZIKV
lysate (Fig. 4A). An additional four ZIKV cross-reactive mAbs
were identified using a whole-virus capture ELISA (Fig. 4B and
Table S2). A majority of the ZIKV-specific mAbs (20/26) came
from the plasmablasts of donors 31 and 39. Only a handful of
mAbs from donors 32 and 33 cross-reacted with ZIKV, with
several of these recognizing only whole ZIKV. Although nearly
half of all DENV-reactive mAbs bound ZIKV lysate or whole
virus, only seven of the mAbs neutralized ZIKV in vitro (Fig. 4 C
and D and Table S2). Six of these seven mAbs exhibited moderate
neutralizing activity against ZIKV, with FRNT50 titers ranging
between 5 μg/mL and 1 μg/mL. In contrast, mAb 33.3A06 was
highly potent in ZIKV neutralization with a ZIKV FRNT50 titer
of 0.03 μg/mL. Interestingly, despite the overall lower frequency of
ZIKV-binding mAbs isolated from 32 and 33, half of all ZIKV-
neutralizing mAbs in the panel, including the three most potently
neutralizing mAbs, were derived from these two patients. Reper-
toire analysis of the cross-reactive mAbs showed broad immuno-
globulin variable gene use and junctional diversity. The cross-
reactive cells were also highly mutated, illustrating that these
responses were likely the result of multiple previous DENV
exposures (Table S2).
Dengue-Induced Antibodies Can Enhance ZIKV Infection of an FcγR-
Bearing Monocytic Cell Line in Vitro. We tested the ability of five
dengue sera and 11 plasmablast-derived mAbs to enhance ZIKV
infection using a human FcγR-bearing monocytic cell line, U937.
The U937 cell line is widely used to study ADE of DENV infection,
and it is not typically permissive to high levels of DENV infection in
the absence of enhancing antibodies (17). The five dengue sera
tested were all acute samples from DENV2-infected patients, in-
cluding patients 31, 32, 33, and 39 from whose plasmablasts the
mAbs in this study were derived. The mAbs tested included seven
ZIKV-neutralizing mAbs, of which six were intermediate in neu-
tralization (ELISA+/Neutint) and one potent (ELISA+/Neut++),
two ZIKV-reactive but nonneutralizing mAbs (ELISA+/Neutneg),
and two mAbs that bound DENV but did not cross-react with
ZIKV (ELISA−/Neutneg). In addition to the dengue sera and mAbs,
one flavivirus-naïve serum sample (#21) and two irrelevant mAbs
(cholera and influenza-specific) were also tested for ZIKV ADE
activity. A representative example of the flow cytometry-based assay
showing ADE activity of mAb 31.3F01 is provided in Fig. 5A. Each
of the five dengue sera tested was able to enhance ZIKV infection
of U937 cells, with peak percent infection between 27% (#31) to
66% (#55). The bell-shaped ADE curves observed with this assay
generally seemed to shift to lower dilutions as the neutralizing
potency of the serum sample increased (Fig. 5B and Table S1),
presumably due to complete neutralization of the virus at higher
concentrations. The flavivirus-naïve serum sample did not enhance
ZIKV infection of U937 cells (Fig. 5B).
The six ELISA+/Neutint mAbs enhanced ZIKV infection at the
maximum concentration tested (10 μg/mL), whereas the potent
neutralizer 33.3A06 exhibited minimal ADE above 2 μg/mL, again
potentially due to complete viral neutralization. At lower concen-
trations, however, the mAb facilitated the infection of U937 cells,
reaching a maximal percent infection of 81% (Fig. 5C). The two
ZIKV ELISA+/Neutneg mAbs also enhanced ZIKV infection, simi-
lar to the neutralizing mAbs. Two mAbs that were previously
shown to be DENV1-specific (13) and were ZIKV-nonreactive
(Fig. 4) did not enhance ZIKV infection (Fig. 5C). These data
demonstrate that ZIKV-reactive antibodies can potentiate

range of individual antibodies vary significantly.
Discussion
The emerging ZIKV shares a high degree of sequence and
structural homology compared with other flaviviruses, such as
DENV (16). For the current outbreak in the Americas and the
Caribbean, this is of major public health concern. It is not clear
how preexisting antibody titers to other flaviviruses might affect
the quality of immune responses generated to ZIKV infection
and, equally important, whether such cross-reactive anti-
bodies provide protective immunity or impact disease severity
in infected adults (18). In the study presented here, we have
determined the degree by which dengue-induced antibodies
cross-react with ZIKV, both at a serum level as well as at a single-
cell level.
We characterized the ZIKV binding and neutralization po-
tential of sera obtained from PCR-confirmed dengue patients
sampled during acute disease and at convalescence. Both acute
and convalescent sera had high IgG binding titers to ZIKV and
potently neutralized the virus in vitro (Figs. 2C and 3B and Table
S1). Although no obvious correlation was observed between
DENV2- and ZIKV-specific neutralization titers in the same
patients (Table S1), it is evident that a significant proportion of
serum antibodies present after DENV infection cross-react with
ZIKV. Although a majority of the dengue sera tested neutralized
DENV2 more potently than ZIKV, sera from patients #55 and
#79 had higher FRNT50 titers to ZIKV compared with DENV2
(Table S1). For patient #79, the lower dengue titers could simply
be attributed to the mismatch between the serotype of infection
(DENV1) and the virus tested (DENV2). For patient #55, this
could have been caused by genetic differences between the labo-
ratory-adapted DENV2 strain used in our study and the infecting
DENV2 strain. An alternative possibility is that these patients were
previously exposed to ZIKV and thus had ZIKV-reactive anti-
bodies in their sera as a result. In fact, in the past few years, isolated
cases of ZIKV transmission in Thailand have been reported (10,
19, 20). Although there is no evidence of previous ZIKV epidemics
in Thailand, the possibility that the patients in our study are ZIKV-
immune and that the extensive cross-reactivity of their sera against
ZIKV is due to preexisting ZIKV-induced antibodies cannot be
formally ruled out. To definitively conclude that antibodies in-
duced by DENV infection cross-react with ZIKV, it is important
to demonstrate this cross-reactivity at the monoclonal level as well.
In addition, from the serum data it is unclear whether the ob-
served cross-reactivity is caused by a small number of highly po-
tent, cross-reactive antibodies or if this is the result of a broader,
low-level cross-reactivity.
To deconstruct the cross-reactivity observed at the serum
level, we analyzed the ZIKV binding and neutralization activities
of plasmablast-derived mAbs generated from four acutely in-
fected DENV2 patients. We found that over half of the DENV-
reactive mAbs bound with high affinity to ZIKV (Fig. 4 A and B).
At least 23 of the 26 ZIKV cross-reactive mAbs were E protein-
specific, as they were previously shown to bind recombinant
DENV E protein (13). Although cross-reactive binding was
abundant and all 26 ZIKV-reactive mAbs neutralized DENV2,

 less than a third neutralized ZIKV in vitro. Furthermore, of the
seven ZIKV-neutralizing mAbs, only one displayed potent neu-
tralization activity (Fig. 4C). Therefore, even though a large
number of dengue patient mAbs were able to bind viral epitopes,
the capacity to cross-neutralize ZIKV was restricted to a select
few. Additionally, a majority of these DENV-reactive mAbs were
previously shown to neutralize more than one DENV serotype
(Table S2) (13). Hence, for a large proportion of our mAb panel,
the ability to cross-neutralize the virus did not extend beyond the
DENV species to ZIKV. Lastly, no obvious patterns in terms of
VH gene use or dominant clones were observed for the ZIKV-
reactive mAbs (Table S2) (13). Thus, the cross-reactivity observed
at the serum level, at least for these four patients, appears to be
caused by a diverse repertoire of B cells.
The ZIKV E protein shares a high degree of homology with
the E protein of other flaviviruses including DENV (16). We
compared the E proteins of the ZIKV and DENV2 strains used
in our study and found an overall sequence identity of 54% (Fig.
S1 A and C). EDI and EDII were relatively more conserved than
EDIII, which had a lower sequence identity of 44.6% (Fig. S1C).
Notably, the fusion loop is 100% conserved between the two
viruses and also compared with other flaviviruses including yel-
low fever virus, West Nile virus, and Japanese encephalitis virus
(Fig. S1B). The fusion loop has been described as a target for
broadly cross-reactive antibodies against DENV (21, 22) as well
as other flaviviruses (23–25) and could be one of the epitopes
targeted by the cross-reactive antibodies described in our study.
In addition, despite the amino acid differences between the
DENV2 and ZIKV E proteins compared, the two proteins share
nearly identical structures (Fig. 1A). This could have important
implications for antibodies against conformationally sensitive
epitopes, which depend on the quaternary structure of the E
protein for recognition and binding (26–28). In fact, four out of
the seven ZIKV-neutralizing antibodies characterized in this
study bound to whole virus but failed to bind ZIKV lysate,
suggesting that they recognize a conformational epitope. Efforts
to map some of the antibodies described earlier are ongoing,
focused especially on the potent ZIKV neutralizer 33.3A06.
Identifying potential targets for broadly cross-neutralizing anti-
body responses could inform the design of vaccines or antibody-
based therapies in the future.
Because the current ZIKV outbreak is largely localized within
dengue-endemic areas, the potential for preexisting dengue-induced
antibodies to enhance ZIKV infection is of concern. ADE is hy-
pothesized to contribute to the increased disease severity often
observed in secondary DENV infections (29). ADE is thought to
occur when preexisting cross-reactive antibodies form virus–anti-
body complexes that then facilitate the infection of FcγR-bearing
cells (30). This may increase the number of infected cells and cause
higher serum viral loads, which have been shown to positively cor-
relate with higher disease severity (31, 32). To determine whether
dengue antibodies can enhance ZIKV infection in vitro, we infected
the FcγR-bearing U937 monocytic cell line in the presence of five
acute sera and 11 dengue mAbs. All five sera and the nine ZIKV-
reactive mAbs tested enhanced ZIKV infection in vitro (Fig. 5 B
and C). Two DENV1-specific mAbs that did not react to ZIKV by
binding or neutralization assays failed to enhance ZIKV infection in
this system (Fig. 5C). These data clearly illustrate that ZIKV
cross-reactive antibodies induced after DENV infection can
enhance ZIKV infection in vitro. However, it is important to
point out that the physiological relevance of this mechanism
must be carefully examined in vivo to determine its importance in
the context of ZIKV infection of flavivirus-immune patients.
Our findings raise important questions regarding the role of
cross-reactive antibodies in protective immunity as well as their
potential impact on ZIKV pathogenesis and disease severity. The
data presented suggest that ZIKV infection may have the poten-
tial to reactivate cross-reactive dengue-induced memory responses
in patients with prior DENV exposures. There may thus be in-
teresting differences between the immunological responses of
DENV-immune patients versus those of a flavivirus-naïve indi-
vidual to ZIKV. To address these issues, ongoing comparative

 studies of immune responses, disease severity, and clinical out-
comes in ZIKV-infected patients in both flavivirus-endemic and
nonendemic areas are required. One of the most critical aspects
of the current ZIKV virus outbreak is the ability of the virus to
cause congenital microcephaly (6, 7). It will be essential to de-
termine if the preexisting cross-reactive antibodies may be in-
volved in the context of maternal–fetal transmission of ZIKV.
Equally important, studying cross-reactivity against multiple
ZIKV isolates, derived from both recent and previous epidemics,
might shed light on the cause for the increased disease severity
observed in the current outbreak. Finally, as additional ZIKV-re-
active human plasmablast and memory B-cell–derived mAbs are
identified, characterizing their in vivo properties in murine and
macaque models will be an important step in generating poten-
tial prophylactic/therapeutic treatments. Such studies will also
improve our understanding of the immunobiology of ZIKV
infection and how preexisting antibodies to DENV or other
flaviviruses might modulate the ZIKV-immune response.
Materials and Methods
Patient Samples. The dengue serum samples in this study were collected at
Siriraj Hospital in Bangkok, Thailand. All patients were diagnosed with DENV
infection by serotype-specific RT-PCR (33), and serum samples were collected
during acute infection and/or convalescence. From four of these patients,
a panel of mAbs was derived from single cell-sorted plasmablasts (13).
Two flavivirus-naïve sera were also included as controls. All studies were
preapproved by the Faculty of Medicine at Siriraj Hospital and the Emory
institutional review board (IRB) (#IRB00015730).
Viruses and Viral Antigens. The ZIKV and DENV2 strains used in this study were
ZIKV PRVABC59 (KU501215.1) and DENV2 Tonga/74 (AY744147.1). For a
detailed description of how the virus was propagated and ZIKV lysate was
prepared, SI Materials and Methods.
Binding, Neutralization, and ADE Assays. Sera and mAbs were tested for
binding to ZIKV lysate and whole virus by ELISA. The endpoint titer/minimum
effective concentration was determined as the concentration required for
three times the background signal of flavivirus-naive serum/irrelevant mAb.
The ZIKV neutralization activity of samples was determined by FRNT. FRNT50
was determined as the concentration or dilution factor of the sample re-
quired for 50% neutralization of the virus. A flow cytometry-based ADE assay
was performed to determine percent enhancement of ZIKV infection in the
presence of dengue antibodies. U937 cells were infected with a mixture of
serum/mAb and ZIKV, and infected cells were stained using 4G2 and anti-
mouse A488. Detailed descriptions of the ELISA, FRNT, and ADE assays are
provided in SI Materials and Methods.
