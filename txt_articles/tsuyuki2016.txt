ABSTRACT 
Background: Despite the risk associated with hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, and 
smoking, these cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors remain poorly identified and controlled.  
Objectives: To evaluate the effectiveness of a community pharmacy-based case finding and 
intervention on cardiovascular risk. 
Methods: RxEACH was a randomized trial conducted in 56 community pharmacies across 
Alberta, Canada. Participants were recruited by their pharmacist, enrolling adults at high risk for 
CVD: those with diabetes, chronic kidney disease, previous vascular disease and/or Framingham 
Risk > 20% with ≥1 uncontrolled risk factor (blood pressure, LDL-cholesterol (LDL-c), HbA1c, 
or smoking). Patients were randomized to intervention or usual care groups. 
Intervention group received a Medication Therapy Management review from their pharmacist 
with CVD risk assessment and education. Pharmacists prescribed medications and ordered 
laboratory tests as per their scope of practice to achieve treatment targets. Subjects received 
monthly follow-up visits for 3 months.  
Usual care group received usual pharmacist care with no specific intervention. 
Primary outcome was difference in change in estimated CVD risk between intervention and 
usual care groups at 3 months. CVD risk was estimated using the greater of Framingham, 
International Score, or United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study risk engines. 
Results: We enrolled 723 patients. Mean age was 62 (standard deviation, SD 12) years, 58% 
male and 27% smokers. After adjusting for baseline values and center effect, there was a 21% 
difference in CVD risk (p<0.001) between intervention and usual care groups. Intervention group 
had greater reductions of 0.2 mmol/L in LDL-c (p<0.001), 9.37 mmHg systolic blood pressure 
(p<0.001), 0.92% HbA1c (p<0.001), and 20.2% in smoking cessation (p=0.002). 
Conclusions: RxEACH was the first large randomized trial of CVD risk reduction by 
community pharmacists, demonstrating a significant reduction in the risk for CVD events. 
Engagement of community pharmacists with an expanded scope of practice could have 
significant public health implications.

Introduction 
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death worldwide, accounting for nearly 
one third of all deaths (1). Most CVDs are caused by modifiable risk factors, including tobacco 
smoking, hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes, physical inactivity, high fat diet and obesity (1). 
Despite decreases in rates over the last few decades, CVDs remain one of the leading causes of 
death in Canada and the United States (2, 3). CVD also carries a financial burden on the North 
American economy with a cost close to $ 21 billion every year divided between loss of 
productivity and healthcare costs in Canada (2) and $444 billion overall cost in the US (4). 
Notwithstanding major advances in treatment, the prevalence of poorly controlled CVD risk 
factors is still substantial in North America (5,-7). Recent studies have indicated that almost 50% 
of the community dwelling patients with type 2 diabetes are not at their HbA1c, (8) or 
cholesterol (9,10) targets, and between 50-62% are not at their blood pressure targets (9,10). In 
one of these studies, only 13% achieved the composite triple target (10). Furthermore, less than 
half of the patients with hyperlipidemia were reportedly receiving the appropriate treatment (9). 
Guidelines recommend using CVD risk assessment equations to guide prevention and 
management (11). Despite this, it is often not integrated into clinicians’ daily routine. In one 
study, the majority of the patients attending physicians’ clinics reported that they had never 
undergone cardiovascular risk assessment (11). Taken together, the high prevalence of CVD and 
suboptimal assessment and management of risk factors indicate the need to consider alternative 
approaches to this major public health problem. 
Community pharmacists are accessible primary healthcare professionals who frequently see 
patients with chronic diseases (12); as such, they are well positioned to identify patients with/at 
high risk for CVD, determine their CVD risk and assist in their disease management. The

efficacy of pharmacists’ intervention on individual CVD risk factors has been well demonstrated 
(13-17), however their role in targeting multiple risk factors to reduce overall CVD risk has not 
been determined. Expansion of the scope of practice of pharmacists; such as in Alberta, Canada, 
provides an opportunity for pharmacists to independently prescribe and order laboratory tests. 
These added privileges might help to address the phenomenon of therapeutic inertia (18) in the 
community.  
The purpose of the RxEACH study was to develop and implement a broad-based community 
pharmacist-initiated vascular risk reduction case-finding and intervention program in patients at 
high risk for cardiovascular disease and to evaluate its impact on risk for cardiovascular events.   
Methods 
The RxEACH study was a multicenter randomized controlled trial with the patient as the unit of 
randomization (Figure 1), conducted in 56 community pharmacies in the province of Alberta, 
Canada. 
We included adults (≥18 years of age) who were at high risk for cardiovascular events: those 
with diabetes, chronic kidney disease (estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 
<60mL/min/1.73m2 upon 2 consecutive measurements within a 3-month period or albumin to 
creatinine ratio (ACR) of ≥30 (single measurement), or between 3-29 on 2 consecutive 
measurements within a 3-month period), had established atherosclerotic vascular disease (via 
patient health records or self-report) including cerebrovascular disease (prior stroke or transient 
ischemic attack), cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction, acute coronary syndrome, stable 
angina, or revascularization), or peripheral arterial disease (symptomatic and/or ankle brachial 
index <0.9), or primary prevention patients with multiple risk factors and Framingham risk score

>20%. In addition, subjects must have had at least one uncontrolled risk factor (blood pressure 
>140/90 or >130/80mmHg if diabetic, LDL-c >2.0 mmol/L, HbA1c >7.0%, or current smoker).  
We excluded patients who were unwilling to participate or provide written informed consent, 
unwilling or unable to participate in regular follow-up visits, or were pregnant. 
Pharmacists used a proactive case-finding strategy (19), to identify potential participants, which  
focused on their high-risk patients who were receiving metformin (as a marker for Type 2 
diabetes), clopidogrel or ASA (for coronary artery disease), antihypertensive agents, statins for 
dyslipidemic patients, and known smokers. In addition, pharmacists used newspaper or other 
advertising outlets, or in pharmacy heart health clinics.  
After obtaining written informed consent, patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to intervention 
or usual care groups using a centralized secure website at the data management center 
(EPICORE Centre). The randomization scheme was blocked (random block size) and stratified 
by pharmacy. 
Baseline assessment of cardiovascular risk factors was conducted and the patient’s family 
physician was informed of the patient’s inclusion into the study. Any subsequent changes made 
to participants’ treatment regimens were also communicated to the physician (as per usual 
pharmacist practice in Alberta). 
Intervention: Patients randomized to the intervention group received a Medication Therapy 
Management consultation from their pharmacist (in Alberta, called a Comprehensive Annual 
Care Plan or Standard Medication Management Assessment), which included: 
• Patient assessment (blood pressure measurement according to Canadian Hypertension 
Education Program guidelines (20), waist circumference, weight and height 
measurements)

• Laboratory assessment of HbA1c, fasting cholesterol profile (if not done within the past 3 
months) eGFR and ACR (if not done within the past 12 months) 
• Individual assessment of CVD risk and education about this risk: 
o The cardiovascular risk was calculated using an online tool. Our system used the 
appropriate risk engine based on the patient’s medical history. The United Kingdom 
Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) risk engine (21), the International model for 
prediction of recurrent cardiovascular disease (22) and Framingham (23) were used 
for patients with diabetes, previous vascular disease, CKD or primary prevention, 
respectively. In the case where a patient had more than one co-morbidity, the risk 
engine estimating the highest risk was used. 
o Discussion of CVD risk with the patient using the interactive online tool to explain 
his/her individual cardiovascular risk and targets for intervention (see 
www.epicore.ualberta.ca/CVrisk) and healthy lifestyle options. 
• Providing treatment recommendations based upon the most up to date Canadian clinical 
practice guidelines for cardiovascular risk factors 
• Prescription adaptation(s), and/or de novo prescriptions where necessary to meet lipid, 
blood pressure and glycemic control targets and smoking cessation. 
• Regular communication with the patient’s family physician after each contact with the 
patient  
• Regular follow-up with all patients a minimum of every 3-4 weeks for 3 months 
Pharmacists in Alberta can bill the provincial health plan for providing such services.

Usual care: Patients randomized to the usual care group received usual pharmacist care with no 
specific interventions for 3 months. At the end of the 3 months of the usual care period, all 
patients were offered the intervention outlined above. 
Outcomes: The primary outcome was the difference in change in estimated cardiovascular risk 
between intervention and usual care groups at 3 months. We defined cardiovascular risk as the 
risk for future cardiovascular events (e.g., myocardial infarction, revascularization, 
cardiovascular death) as calculated by the validated risk engines as described above. Secondary 
outcomes included the difference in change in individual cardiovascular risk factors between 
intervention and usual care groups at 3 months, including systolic and diastolic blood pressure, 
LDL-c, HbA1c, and smoking cessation. 
Sample size and analytical plan: Using the information from Grover and colleagues (24) 
(baseline CVD risk and standard deviation), a reduction in estimated risk for cardiovascular 
events of 25% in the intervention group and 17.5% in the control group (absolute difference of 
7.5%), assuming 90% power and a 2-sided alpha of 0.05, required an overall sample size of 674 
patients (337 in each group). This sample size was inflated to 704 (352 in each group) to account 
for possible dropouts, losses to follow-up and withdrawals of consent. 
All analyses were conducted on an intention to treat basis. In the case of missing data, a last 
observation carried forward approach was used. The primary outcome was analyzed using 
ANCOVA, adjusting for center effect and all covariates with p<0.25 between groups.  Secondary 
outcomes of blood pressure, dyslipidemia and HbA1c were analyzed using ANCOVA, adjusting 
for center effect and all covariates with p<0.25 between groups. Smoking cessation was analyzed 
using Chi Square.

 Data and trial management and biostatistical support was provided by EPICORE Centre 
(www.epicore.ualberta.ca). 
Pharmacist Training: Pharmacist training was based on the current Canadian guidelines (25-
30). The research team developed an online training program that was reviewed internally and 
externally for content validity. The training program was hosted online at the Faculty of 
Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Alberta server and provided at face-to-
face regional meetings. The training program included modules on case-finding, cardiovascular 
risk calculation and patient communication of cardiovascular risk, chronic kidney disease, 
hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes, smoking cessation, diet and lifestyle management, and 
documentation of care plans for remuneration by Alberta Health. A hotline was made available 
for participating pharmacists to connect them with experts in cardiovascular risk reduction and 
study procedures.   
RxEACH was approved by the Health Research Ethics Boards of the University of Alberta and 
the University of Calgary and was registered on clinicaltrials.gov (NCT01979471). 
Results 
The RxEACH trial began enrolment on January 27, 2014, with 56 sites (pharmacies) involved 
(see Acknowledgements for list of pharmacist investigators). A total of 913 subjects were 
screened, 827 of whom were eligible. We randomized 723; 353 were assigned to usual care and 
370 to intervention (Figure 1). The last patient was enrolled June 3, 2015 and follow-up was 
completed on September 24, 2015. There were 10 early withdrawals in the usual care group 
(2.8%) and 19 in the intervention group (5.1%), mostly because of losses to follow-up in both 
groups.

Baseline characteristics are shown in Table 1. The two treatment groups were well balanced in 
demographic and clinical parameters (Table 1). The average age was 62 (standard deviation, SD 
12) years and 58% were male. In terms of CVD risk factors, 84% had hypertension, 83% had 
dyslipidemia, 64% reported sedentary lifestyle, 27% were smokers, mean body mass index was 
34 (SD 13.2). In addition, 79% had diabetes, 40% had chronic kidney disease, and 30% had 
atherosclerotic vascular disease (stroke/transient ischemic attack, acute coronary syndromes, 
angina, revascularization or peripheral arterial disease). A total of 53 patients were high risk 
primary prevention (Framingham risk >20%). The inclusion criteria for the study required the 
presence of at least one poorly controlled risk factor. Of all the patients enrolled, 79% of those 
with diabetes had poor glycemic control (as measured by HbA1c), 72% had poorly controlled 
blood pressure, 59% had poorly controlled dyslipidemia, and 27% were smokers (categories not 
mutually exclusive).  
At the baseline visit, mean blood pressure was 137 (SD 20) / 81 (SD 12), total cholesterol was 
4.3 (SD 1.0) mmol/L, LDL cholesterol was 2.4 (SD 1.2) mmol/L and HDL cholesterol was 1.2 
(SD 0.4) mmol/L. In the 573 patients with diabetes, the average duration of diabetes was 12 (SD 
11) years, and mean HbA1c was 8.6 (SD 2)%. Estimated baseline cardiovascular risk was 26.6 
(SD 19.3)% in the usual care group and 25.6 (SD 17.8)% in the intervention group (Table 1).  
Estimated cardiovascular risk changed over the 3 month follow-up period from 26.6 (SD 19.3)% 
to 25.9 (SD 19.6)% in the usual care group, compared to 25.6 (SD 17.8)% at baseline to 20.5 
(SD 15.9)% in the intervention group. This, when adjusted for the center effect, corresponded to 
a relative decrease in estimated cardiovascular risk of 21% (an absolute difference of 5.37, 95% 
CI -6.56, -4.17, p<0.001) (Figure 2), the primary outcome.

Table 2 outlines medication use and changes that were made in the study population, and show 
more changes in hypgoglycemic, hypertension and dyslipidemia medications in the intervention 
group. Secondary outcomes are shown in Table 3. The difference in LDL cholesterol was -0.2 
(95% CI -0.31, -0.08, p=0.001) mmol/L, in systolic blood pressure was -9.37 (95% CI -11.07, -
7.67, p<0.001) mmHg, in diastolic blood pressure was -2.92 (95% CI -4.21, -1.62, p< 0.001) 
mmHg, in HbA1c (in diabetics only) was -0.92 (95% CI -1.12, -0.72, p<0.001)%. There were 
20.2% fewer smokers (95% CI 9.9, 30.4, p<0.001) in the intervention group. Figure 3 shows 
achievement of targets for LDL cholesterol, blood pressure, HbA1c and smoking, with the 
intervention group showing improvements across all categories. Body mass index changed from 
34.08 (SD 15.3) to 32.9 (SD 8.0) in the usual care group, and from 33.27 (SD 10.8) to 32.6 (SD 
8.8) in the intervention group. There were no adverse events reported during the trial. 
Discussion 
Cardiovascular diseases remain the most important causes of death and disability worldwide (1). 
While the risk factors for cardiovascular disease are well known, poor identification of those at 
risk and poor control of these factors remains an enigma (5-10). In the RxEACH study, we found 
that engaging community pharmacists in identifying at-risk candidates (case finding) and 
managing their cardiovascular risk factors using an advanced scope of practice that included 
prescribing and ordering laboratory tests, resulted in a 21% reduction in their risk for 
cardiovascular events in only 3 months. As pharmacists are highly accessible primary healthcare 
providers, this could have major public health implications in reducing the burden of CVD if 
these practices were widely adopted. 
Our results add to an already rich literature on the efficacy of pharmacist care on the individual 
components of cardiovascular risk factors. These non-prescribing trials have been elegantly

summarized in a meta analysis by Santschi and colleagues (15), who noted significant 
improvements in dyslipidemia, hypertension, and smoking cessation. Furthermore, our group has 
recently published trials of independent pharmacist prescribing in patients with poorly controlled 
diabetes (31) and hypertension (32). To our knowledge, RxEACH is the first large scale 
randomized trial of overall cardiovascular risk reduction, targeting multiple risk factors together.  
O’Donovan and colleagues conducted a literature review to study pharmacist’s use of CV 
screening tools and reported that the majority of the screenings were either opportunistic or 
referral-based. They highlighted the lack of proactive case finding approach in such programs 
(33). Our results take their findings to the next level. They are also consistent with the findings 
of Mc Namara and colleagues (34, 35) who conducted a pilot longitudinal pre-and-post-test 
study to evaluate the impact of a medication review and educational intervention on patients’ CV 
risk in a community pharmacy setting, and reported a significant CV risk reduction over a 6-
month period.  RxEACH is also a validation of the merits of a broader scope of practice for 
pharmacists, in this case, of independent prescribing authority and ability to order and interpret 
laboratory tests. Indeed, we reported recently that of the patients receiving baseline assessments 
in RxEACH, 290 had chronic kidney disease, of whom 40% had previous unrecognized chronic 
kidney disease (i.e., was identified by the pharmacist in the course of targeted screening for 
CKD) (36, 37). As a practice-based trial of an approach to cardiovascular risk reduction, we can 
only speculate that the improvements seen were due to changes in medication use (as seen in 
Table 2), dosage adjustment, and improved adherence to lifestyle and medications – all of which 
were enhanced by the guidelines-recommended follow-up visits performed by the pharmacists.  
A number of strengths and limitations warrant mention. Use of a randomized controlled design 
portends a high level of causal inference. In terms of sustainability of the intervention, we used

the medication management remuneration program already established by the Alberta 
government (and also present in most US states) which reimburses pharmacists for their care. 
Indeed, our study could be seen as a validation of these medication management programs. With 
respect to limitations, our follow-up duration was relatively short. The reason for this short 
duration was a compromise decision made because investigators (pharmacists) had expressed 
concerns over “usual care” in these high-risk patients. We decided to shorten the follow-up 
duration to 3 months, and allow usual care allocated patients to cross over to receive the 
intervention after 3 months. While 3 month outcomes for smoking cessation are rather short (and 
could certainly be subject to recidivism), they may bias against the intervention because of the 
short duration to achieve reductions in LDL cholesterol (which respond slowly to medication 
changes), blood pressure (which often takes several weeks to see the full effects of a medication 
change) and HbA1c (which takes up to 3 months to show full effects of changes in glycemic 
control). As such, we may be underestimating the impact on these parameters. Another potential 
limitation is generalizability to other pharmacists in other jurisdictions. While pharmacists in the 
province of Alberta certainly have a broad scope of practice which includes independent 
prescribing and the ability to order laboratory tests, many jurisdictions in North America do 
allow for medication management reviews, ability to adjust and adapt prescriptions, make 
recommendations to physicians, and receive remuneration for these activities. Training on 
cardiovascular risk reduction is widely available and should not limit generalizability of our 
findings. We used risk estimation equations for our primary outcome. We acknowledge that 
these equations were not designed to measure change. Nevertheless, we wished to capture the 
overall effect of a cardiovascular risk reduction program and reported a relative reduction in risk 
(as such, biases and limitations would presumably equally present at baseline and at the end of

follow-up for all patients). Similarly, the lack of a validated equation for patients with CKD 
almost certainly underestimated the risk for these patients, but again, reporting of a relative 
reduction in risk should alleviate this concern. With regards to smoking cessation, we used 
patient self report and assessment by the pharmacist to determine smoking status rather than 
methods such as carbon monoxide detection. Finally, due to the nature of the intervention, we 
could not blind investigators to treatment allocation. 
Cardiovascular diseases remain important public health problems in the United States, 
Canada and worldwide (1). As such, our study demonstrating the impact of an advanced scope of 
pharmacist practice might have important public health implications. Indeed, engaging 
pharmacists could bring another 450,000 helping hands in the United States and Canada to help 
reduce the burden of cardiovascular disease. It is important to note that the reductions in 
cardiovascular risk were achieved on top of (not instead of) usual physician care. 
Interprofessional communication and collaboration remain key. We would encourage 
policymakers to consider broadening the scope of practice of pharmacists (like in Alberta) and 
for pharmacists and pharmacy professional organizations to seize these opportunities for the 
betterment of patient care. 
Conclusions 
Cardiovascular diseases and their associated risk factors remain an important public health 
problem. In the RxEACH study, we demonstrated that pharmacists with an advanced scope of 
practice could identify patients with poorly controlled risk factors and significantly reduce their 
risk for cardiovascular events. Adopting these practice innovations could have major public 
health benefits.

Figure 1: Case-finding, enrolment, randomization and completeness of follow-up. This 
figure describes the screening and randomization and follow-up of patients in the study. 
Figure 2: Primary Outcome: Effect of pharmacist care on estimated risk for 
cardiovascular events. This figure outlines the effect of the pharmacist care intervention on 
reduction in estimated risk for cardiovascular events from baseline to 3 months in patients 
randomized to usual care or intervention groups. Relative risk reduction between usual care 
and intervention was 21% (a 5.37% absolute reduction, 95% CI -6.56, 4.17, p< 0.001), after 
adjustment for baseline values and the center effect. Est. CV Risk = estimated risk for 
cardiovascular events 
Figure 3: Achievement of cholesterol, blood pressure and glycemic targets and smoking 
status at 3 months. This figure shows the number and proportion of patients achieving the 
recommended targets for LDL-c (<2.0 mmol/L), blood pressure (<140/90mmHg or 
<130/80mmHg if diabetic), glycemic control via HbA1c (<7,0%), and current smoking status 
at the end of follow-up. In all cases, pharmacist care (intervention) resulted in significantly 
more patients reaching targets: for LDL-c, an absolute difference of 9.9% (95% CI 2.2, 17.5, 
p=0.012); for BP, an absolute difference of 23.1% (95% CI 16.0, 30.1, p<0.001); for HbA1c, 
an absolute difference of 17.6% (95% CI 9.9, 25.4, p<0.001); and for smoking, an absolute 
difference of 6.9% (95% CI 0.6, 13.2, p=0.032).

“Patients with any medication change” refers to patients who had any change (addition or 
discontinuation) of medication by their pharmacist. For example, this might include a change 
from fluvastatin to rosuvastatin. This category excludes those with dosage changes to existing 
medications. 
“Patients with dosage change only” refers to patients who had the dosage adjusted of their 
medication (either upwards or downwards) by their pharmacist. This category excludes changes 
to the medication from one drug to another or discontinuation of a medication. 
“Hypoglycemic medications”, “Hypertension Medications” and Dyslipidemia Medications” refer 
to only those patients with diabetes, hypertension and dyslipidemia, respectively (hence the
