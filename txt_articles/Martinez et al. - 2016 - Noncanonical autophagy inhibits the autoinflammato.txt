Abstract
Defects in dying cell clearance are postulated to underlie the pathogenesis of systemic lupus 
erythematosus (SLE)1. Mice lacking molecules associated with dying cell clearance develop SLE-
like disease2, and phagocytes from SLE patients often display defective clearance and increased 
inflammatory cytokine production when exposed to dying cells in vitro. Previously, we3–6 and 
others7 described a form of noncanonical autophagy called “LC3-associated phagocytosis” (LAP), 
wherein phagosomes containing engulfed particles, including dying cells3,4,7, recruit elements of 
the autophagy pathway to facilitate phagosome maturation and digestion of cargo. Genome-wide 
association studies have identified polymorphisms in atg58 and possibly atg79, involved in both 
canonical autophagy and LAP3–7, as predisposition markers for SLE. Here, we describe the 
consequences of defective LAP in vivo. Mice lacking any of several components of the LAP 
pathway display elevated serum inflammatory cytokines, autoantibodies, glomerular immune 
complex deposition, and evidence of kidney damage. Dying cells, injected into LAP-deficient 
animals, are engulfed but not efficiently degraded, and trigger acute elevation of pro-inflammatory

 cytokines but not the anti-inflammatory interleukin (IL)-10. Repeated injection of dying cells into 
LAP-deficient, but not LAP-sufficient animals accelerated SLE-like disease, including increased 
serum levels of autoantibodies. In contrast, animals deficient for genes required for canonical 
autophagy but not LAP do not display defective dead cell clearance, inflammatory cytokine 
production, or SLE-like disease, and like wild-type animals, produce IL-10 in response to dying 
cells. Therefore, defects in LAP, rather than canonical autophagy, can cause SLE-like phenomena, 
and may contribute to the pathogenesis of SLE.
LAP is a process in which some, but not all components of the autophagy machinery 
conjugate LC3 to phosphatidylethanolamine directly on the phagosome membrane3,4,6,7,10. 
The lipidated LC3 (LC3-II) then facilitates lysosomal fusion and cargo destruction. Both 
LAP and canonical autophagy require ATG7, ATG3, ATG5, ATG12, and ATG16L for LC3 
lipidation4,5. However, unlike autophagy, LAP proceeds independently of the pre-initiation 
complex containing ULK1 and FIP2003,4,6,7, and utilizes a distinct Beclin 1-VPS34 
complex lacking ATG145. In contrast, LAP, but not canonical autophagy, requires NADPH 
oxidase-2 (NOX2)5, and Rubicon5. These requirements for LAP and canonical autophagy 
can therefore distinguish between the two processes (Supplementary Table 1). As many 
components of autophagy are required for development (e.g., FIP20011,12, Beclin 112) or 
post-natal survival (e.g., ATG1412,13, ATG712, ATG512, ATG16L12), we generated animals 
in which several autophagy genes were conditionally ablated using LysM-Cre14, affecting 
macrophages (CD11b+/F4/80+), monocytes (CD11b+/CD115+), some neutrophils (CD11b+/
Ly6G+), and some conventional dendritic cells (CD11b+/CD11c+), but not eosinophils, 
plasmacytoid dendritic cells, or lymphocytes (Extended Data Fig. 1A–B). While all animals 
appeared normal at weaning, we observed that LAP-deficient genotypes failed to gain 
weight compared to their wild-type (WT) littermates (Fig. 1A). This effect was observed in 
animals lacking proteins required for both LAP and autophagy (ATG7, ATG5, Beclin 1) or 
LAP alone (NOX2, Rubicon), but not in animals lacking proteins required for autophagy but 
dispensable for LAP (FIP200, ULK1). Compared to LAP-sufficient animals, LAP-deficient 
mice displayed elevated circulating lymphocytes, monocytes, and neutrophils (Extended 
Data Fig. 2A–C), with elevated circulating activated CD8+ T cells (Extended Data Fig. 2B–
C), and increased immunohistological staining of CD3 and Ki67 in the spleen (Extended 
Data Fig. 2D). Strikingly, LAP-deficient animals also contained increased serum levels of 
anti-dsDNA antibodies and anti-nuclear antibodies (Fig. 1B–C), as well as a broad array of 
antibodies against autoantigens commonly associated with SLE (Fig. 1D, Extended Data 
Fig. 3). LAP-deficient animals also presented with IgG and complement C1q deposition in 
glomeruli of kidneys (Fig. 2A–D, Extended Data Fig. 4A–B). In addition, LAP-deficient 
animals displayed indications of kidney damage15, and exhibited increased functional 
markers of kidney injury, such as elevated serum creatinine (Fig. 2E), blood urea nitrogen 
(BUN), and proteinuria (ACR) (Extended Data Fig. 4C–D). Histologically, kidneys from 
aged LAP-deficient animals displayed endocapillary proliferative glomerulonephritis 
(Extended Data Fig. 4E). Increased expression of type I interferon (IFN) regulated genes, 
termed the IFN signature, has been reported in SLE patients16. Analysis revealed increased 
expression of IFN signature genes, such as Ddx58 (which encodes RIG-I) and Isg95, in the 
spleens of aged LAP-deficient animals (Extended Data Fig. 5A). In contrast, none of these 
pathologies were observed in animals lacking autophagy components dispensable for LAP

 (Fig. 2A–E Extended Data Fig. 4A–E, Fig. 5A). Collectively, these observations suggest that 
LAP deficiency, but not autophagy deficiency, causes an autoinflammatory, lupus-like 
syndrome in mice.
The kinetics of disease we observed in all LAP-deficient animals was strikingly similar to 
that of animals lacking T-cell immunoglobulin mucin protein 4 (TIM4) (Fig. 1A–B, 2A, 2E). 
TIM4 is required for engulfment of dying cells in several macrophage populations, and 
animals lacking TIM4 display lupus-like disease2, as do animals defective for other proteins 
involved in the clearance of dying cells, including Mertk, MFG-E8, and C1q1. However, we 
found that neither bone marrow-derived macrophages (Extended Data Fig. 5B), nor 
peritoneal exudate macrophages from 52-week old mice of any genotype (Extended Data 
Fig. 5C) showed any defects in the engulfment of dying cells in vitro. We therefore 
examined the role of LAP in the response to dying cells in vivo. PKH26-labelled WT 
C57Bl/6 thymocytes were UV-irradiated to trigger apoptosis and immediately injected into 
WT animals, or animals with LysM-Cre-mediated deficiency of ATG7 (LAP-deficient, 
autophagy-deficient), LysM-Cre-mediated deficiency of FIP200 (LAP-sufficient, autophagy-
deficient), or ubiquitous deletion of Rubicon (LAP-deficient, autophagy-sufficient), all of 
which also expressed transgenic GFP-LC35. Clearance of dying thymocytes and induction of 
LC3-II (a measure of LC3 conversion5) were monitored in spleen, liver, and kidney. While 
both WT and animals with FIP200-deficiency effectively cleared dying cells (Fig. 3A–B, 
Extended Data Fig. 6A) and converted GFP-LC3 (Extended Data Fig. 6B–D), animals with 
ATG7- or Rubicon-deficiency did not, despite engulfment (Fig. 3A–B, Extended Data Fig. 
6A–B, D, E). These data are consistent with our observations in vitro4 and support the 
conclusion that LAP is required for effective degradation of engulfed, dying cells in vivo. 
Dying cells were engulfed by CD11b+/F4/80+ macrophages, CD11b+/Gr1+ granulocytes, 
CD11b+/CD115+ monocytes, and CD11b+/CD11c+ dendritic cells, equivalently in WT and 
Rubicon−/− mice, but not in TIM4−/− mice (Extended Data Fig. 6E). However, while 
frequency of engulfment declined by 48 hours in all cellular subsets in WT mice, they 
remained elevated in Rubicon−/− mice, consistent with a failure of a LAP-dependent 
mechanism to degrade engulfed corpses (Extended Data Fig. 6E).
Previously, we had found that in contrast to WT or ULK1−/− macrophages, ATG7−/− 
macrophages produce increased levels of inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1β and IL-6 in 
vitro4. We therefore examined cytokine production upon ingestion of dying cells in 
macrophages lacking different components of the LAP or autophagy pathways (Extended 
Data Fig. 7A–D). LAP-deficient (Cre+ ATG7flox/flox,, Cre+ Beclin 1flox/flox, Cre+ 
ATG3flox/flox NOX2−/−, and Rubicon−/−) but not LAP-sufficient (Cre+ FIP200flox/flox, Cre+ 
ATG14flox/flox) macrophages produced IL-1β, IL-6, and IP-10/CXCL10, upon engulfment of 
dying cells (Extended Data Fig, 7A–C). Conversely, LAP-sufficient, but not LAP-deficient 
macrophages produced IL-10 upon engulfment (Extended Data Fig. 7D). We then examined 
the effects of dying cells on serum cytokine production in vivo, following injection of UV-
irradiated thymocytes (Fig. 3C–D). Strikingly, serum IL-1β, IL-6, and MIP-1β/CCL4 were 
acutely elevated in LAP-deficient animals (ATG7 or Rubicon), but not in LAP-sufficient 
animals (WT or FIP200) (Fig. 3C–D). As we had observed in vitro, LAP-sufficient animals 
produced elevated serum IL-10 in response to dying cells, while LAP-deficient animals did 
not (Fig. 3C–D). Therefore, LAP, but not canonical autophagy, is required for the production

 of IL-10 in response to apoptotic cell engulfment, and LAP suppresses production of 
inflammatory cytokines under these conditions.
We next asked if repeated injection of apoptotic thymocytes into LAP-deficient animals 
could exacerbate the SLE-like phenotype observed in aged LAP-deficient animals. 
Beginning at 6 weeks of age, Rubicon+/+ and Rubicon−/− animals were injected with UV-
irradiated thymocytes over an 8-week period. Uninjected Rubicon+/+ animals showed a 
minimal increase in ANA and anti-dsDNA autoantibodies after 8 weeks, and no increase 
attributable to injection of dying cells. Rubicon−/− animals, however, displayed a significant 
increase in serum levels of ANA and anti-dsDNA autoantibodies after 8 weeks of dying cell 
injections, above pre-injection and age-matched, uninjected controls (Fig. 3E). Further, these 
animals displayed IgG and C1q deposition in glomeruli of kidneys (Extended Data Fig. 8A–
B), and injected Rubicon−/− animals displayed elevated levels of alanine aminotransferase 
(ALT), indicative of tissue damage (Extended Data Fig. 8C). Collectively, these data 
demonstrate that defective dead cell clearance associated with LAP deficiency can result in 
development of SLE-like disease.
We next examined spontaneous levels of serum cytokines with age in aniamls with or 
without LAP. All genotypes lacking LAP (Cre+ ATG7flox/flox, Cre+ ATG5flox/flox, Cre+ 
Beclin 1flox/flox, NOX2−/−, and Rubicon−/−) displayed elevated IL-1β, IL-6, IL-12p40, and 
IP-10/CXCL10, (Fig. 4A–D) as well as KC/CXCL1, MIP-1β/CCL4, and MCP-1/CCL2 
(Extended Data Fig. 8D–F). Wild-type animals and animals lacking canonical autophagy, 
but not LAP (in monocytes or systemically), did not display elevated inflammatory 
cytokines at any time point (Fig. 4A–D, Extended Data Fig. 8D–F). In contrast, serum IL-10 
levels, which increased with age in LAP-sufficient strains, were undetectable in animals 
lacking LAP (Fig. 4E). The patterns and kinetics of cytokine levels were similar to that 
observed in TIM4−/− animals (Fig. 4A–E Extended Data Fig. 8D–F).
Our observations indicated that defects in LAP, but not canonical autophagy, cause an 
autoinflammatory, lupus-like syndrome in mice. To further test this idea, we examined both 
LAP-sufficient and LAP-deficient mice bred in an independent facility. Mice with ATG5- or 
ATG3-deficient myeloid cells (defective in LAP and autophagy) displayed increased levels 
of elevated IL-1β, IL-6, IL-12p40, IP-1/CXCL10, KC/CXCL1, MIP-1β/CCL4, and MCP-1/
CCl2 at 52-weeks of age (Extended Data Fig. 9A–G). These LAP-deficient animals also 
displayed significantly lower levels of IL-10, compared to controls (Extended Data Fig. 9H). 
Furthermore, LAP-deficient animals displayed elevated anti-dsDNA antibodies (Extended 
Data Fig. 9I) and serum creatinine (Extended Data Fig. 9J). LAP-deficient animals also 
contained a broad array of antibodies against autoantigens commonly associated with SLE 
(Extended Data Fig. 10). Of note, none of these effects were observed in animals with 
ATG14- or FIP200-deficiency (defective autophagy but normal LAP3,6,7,11,13) (Extended 
Data Fig. 9A–J, 10). It is noteworthy that these effects in two different facilities were 
observed in C57Bl/6 background animals, which is generally resistant to lupus-like 
disease17. Previous studies have shown that one of the LAP-deficient genotypes, nox2−/−, 
causes accelerated, severe lupus-like disease when bred on the lupus-prone MRL.lpr 
background18.

 Altogether, these data suggest that defective LAP results in a failure to digest engulfed dying 
cells, leading to elevated inflammatory cytokine production and a lupus-like syndrome. In 
another study, animals in which lung macrophages were incapable of engulfment due to 
deletion of Rac1 were sensitive to inflammatory cytokine production and inflammatory 
disease upon introduction of dying cells into the lung19. Similarly, TIM4-deficient mice, 
which exhibit defective dead cell engulfment2, showed spontaneous elevation of serum 
inflammatory cytokines with age (Fig. 4, Extended Data Fig. 8) as well as lupus-like disease 
(Fig. 1, 2). In contrast, macrophages defective for LAP engulf dying cells, but fail to 
efficiently digest them4,7. This suggests that LAP-dependent digestion of dying cells, rather 
than engulfment alone, suppresses an inflammatory response by macrophages. In the 
absence of LAP (lack of Beclin 1, ATG7, ATG5, NOX2, Rubicon), macrophages engulf 
dying cells and produce inflammatory cytokines, and animals manifest lupus-like disease. 
However, when canonical autophagy, but not LAP, is defective (lack of FIP200, ULK1), 
dying cells are engulfed, macrophages produce IL-10 but not inflammatory cytokines, and 
no lupus-like disease is observed.
MRL.lpr mice lacking IL-10 display dramatically accelerated lupus-like disease20. While 
macrophages, monocytes, and B cells are the major source of IL-10, specific deletion of 
IL-10 in B cells had no effect on pathogenesis in MRL.lpr mice21. Intriguingly, one study 
found that injection of dendritic cells that had engulfed necrotic cells into IL-10-deficient, 
but not WT mice induced a pronounced lupus-like disease22. Thus, the role of LAP in the 
production of IL-10 may contribute to the disease effects we observed. However, most 
studies have implicated elevated IL-10 levels in mouse and human SLE20,23,24, perhaps 
involved with activation of B lymphocytes25. While IL-10 production in response to dying 
cells was compromised in LAP-deficient macrophages, the production of IL-10 in response 
to other stimuli may remain intact, and thus elevated IL-10 in SLE may be due to other 
events in the pathogenesis of SLE.
Genome-wide association studies have implicated autophagy in SLE (Atg56,8, and possibly 
Atg79) and in Crohn’s disease (Atg16l26). It is noteworthy in this context that the ATG5 
association with SLE may depend on polymorphisms in IL-108,27. Other studies have 
suggested that autophagy suppresses the inflammasome28, providing a possible link between 
autophagy and inflammatory disease. However, the autophagic components identified in 
these studies are also required for LAP. Further, mice18 and humans29, lacking NOX2 
develop SLE, and our studies suggest that defective LAP in this context may contribute to 
this effect. Our findings implicate a noncanonical autophagic process, LAP, in the control of 
inflammatory disease and suggest a link between the clearance of dying cells, autophagic 
processes, and inflammation in the control of SLE.

by Peter Murray, St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital) and GFP-LC3+ mice to generate 
LysM-Cre+ ATG7flox/flox GFP-LC3+ versions of these strains. NOX2−/− mice were 
purchased from Jackson Laboratories. LysM-Cre+ Beclin 1flox/flox (Edmund Rucker, 
University of Kentucky), LysM-Cre+ ATG5flox/flox (Thomas A. Ferguson, Washington 
University), and LysM-Cre+ FIP200flox/flox (Jun-Lin Guan, University of Michigan) were 
bred to GFP-LC3+ mice to generate GFP-LC3+ versions of these strains. TIM4−/− mice were 
kindly provided by Vijay Kuchroo (Harvard University). Rubicon+/+ and Rubicon−/− mice 
were generated using CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing technology5. LysM-Cre+ ATG14flox/flox, 
LysM-Cre+ ATG3flox/flox, LysM-Cre+ ATG5flox/flox, LysM-Cre+ FIP200lox/flox mice (and 
control littermates) were bred and maintained in the Washington University (WU) facility. 
The St. Jude Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee approved all procedures in 
accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Animals.
Bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) were generated from bone marrow 
progenitors obtained from littermates. Freshly prepared bone marrow cells were cultured in 
DMEM medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FCS, 2 mM L-glutamine, 10 mM 
HEPES buffer, 50 μg/ml penicillin, and non-essential amino acids in the presence of 20 
ng/ml rmM-CSF (Peprotech) for 6 days. Nonadherent cells were removed on day 6, and 
adherent macrophages were detached from plates and re-plated for experimental use.
Aging studies
Male wild-type and knockout littermates were co-housed and allowed to age for 52 weeks. 
Animals were weighed and bled retro-orbitally monthly, and serum was collected for use in 
assays (below). Numbers of animals were as follows (in all cases, Cre indicates LysM-Cre.) 
Studies conducted at St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital and reported in Figures 1, 2, 4, 
D2, S3, S4, S5, and S8: Cre− and Cre+ ATG7f/f, n=24 per genotype; Cre− and Cre+ ATG5f/f, 
n=14 per genotype; Cre− and Cre+ Beclin1f/f, n=20 per genotype; Cre− and Cre+ FIP200f/f, 
n=16 per genotype; ULK1+/+ and ULK1−/−, n=14 per genotype; NOX2+/+ and NOX2−/−, 
n=10 per genotype; Rubicon+/+ and Rubicon−/−, n=14 per genotype. Studies conducted at 
Washington University and reported in Figures S9 and S10: Cre− and Cre+ ATG5f/f, n=5 per 
genotype; Cre− and Cre+ ATG3f/f, n=4 per genotype; Cre− and Cre+ FIP200f/f, n=4 per 
genotype; Cre− and Cre+ ATG14f/f, n=4 per genotype.
Induction of apoptosis in thymocytes
Apoptosis was induced in wild-type C57Bl/6 thymocytes by UV irradiation (20 J/m2). 
Thymocytes were washed twice with PBS prior to experimental use.
Staining of apoptotic thymocytes and in vivo adoptive transfer of labeled apoptotic 
thymocytes
UV-treated thymocytes were stained with 20 M PKH26 Red (Sigma), per manufacturer’s 
instructions. 1 × 107 PKH26-labelled, apoptotic thymocytes were injected intravenously into 
GFP-LC3+ animals, and serum, kidney, liver, and spleen was collected at 0, 24, 48, 72, and 
96 hours post-injection. Kidney sections were analyzed for persistence of PKH26-labelled 
apoptotic cells using the Nikon800 microscope. Kidney, liver, and spleen samples were

 analyzed for PKH26-labelled apoptotic cells using flow cytometry. Additionally, samples 
were washed once with FACS buffer and permeabilized with digitonin (Sigma, 200 μg/ml) 
for 15 minutes on ice. Cells were then washed 3 times with FACS buffer and analyzed by 
flow cytometry for membrane-bound GFP-LC3-II associated with engulfed PKH26-labeled 
thymocytes. For quantification of phagocytosis, spleens were harvested and stained for 
fluorescently conjugated surface markers for macrophages (CD11b+ F4/80+), neutrophils 
(CD11b+ Gr-1+), monocytes (CD11b+ CD115+), and dendritic cells (CD11b+ CD11c+). 
Phagocytic efficiency of each cell type (Singlets/cell surface markers+/PKH26+) was 
quantified by flow cytometry (% PKH26).
Repeated injection of apoptotic thymocytes
Six-week-old Rubicon+/+ and Rubicon−/− littermates were used. Serum was collected from 
all animals prior to injection (week 0). 2.0 × 107 UV-irradiated thymocytes (20 J/m2) 
suspended in sterile phosphate buffer were injected i.v. into anesthesized mice, once a week 
for 4 consecutive weeks (from weeks 1 to 4). After a resting period of 15 days, the injections 
were resumed and carried out for other 2 weeks (weeks 6 and 7). Serum was collected one 
week after the last injection (week 8) and assessed for levels of anti-dsDNA autoantibodies 
(Total Ig), anti-nuclear autoantibodies (ANA, Total Ig), and alanine aminotransferase (ALT). 
At week 8, mice were euthanized, the kidneys were harvested, and stained for 
immunofluorescence (below).
Harvest and co-culture of peritoneal exudate cells
For peritoneal exudate cell harvests, mice were injected i.p. with 2 ml of 3% Brewer’s 
thioglycollate and euthanized 96 h later. The peritoneum was washed with 10 ml ice cold 
PBS three times. Cells were centrifuged (1,000x RPM, 6 minutes, 4°C) and washed twice 
with sterile PBS. Peritoneal exudate cells were resuspended in DMEM/10% FBS, counted, 
and plated at 5×105 cells/well in a 12-well plate. Cells were allowed to settle for 2 h 
(37°C/5% CO2) before co-culture with UV-irradiated wild-type thymocytes..
Effects of dying cells on macrophages in vitro
Apoptotic thymocytes were added to BMDM cultures at a ratio of 10:1 (dead 
cell:macrophage). Supernatant was collected after 24 hours of culture and analyzed for 
cytokines (see below).
Flow cytometry analysis
Spleens, livers, and kidneys were harvested from animals at the indicated time-points, and 
single cell suspensions were generated. Cells were washed once with FACS buffer, and 
permeabilized with digitonin (Sigma, 200 μg/ml) for 15 minutes on ice. Cells were then 
washed 3 times with FACS buffer and analyzed by flow cytometry for membrane-bound 
GFP-LC3-II. This assay removes the soluble, cytosolic form of GFP-LC3 (GFP-LC3-I), 
while the lipidated, membrane-bound GFP-LC3-II is retained, allowing total GFP 
fluorescence to be used as a measure of LC3-II generation, indicative of LAP. Permeabilized 
samples were first gated on Singlets/PKH26+, so as to determine the mean fluorescence 
intensity (MFI) of GFP-LC3-II associated with cells that had engulfed a PKH26+ apoptotic

 thymocyte. For surface staining, blood, bone marrow, or splenoyctes were washed once with 
FACS buffer, incubated with Fc Block and stained with the indicated fluorescent antibodies 
(Biolegend) on ice for 20 minutes. Cells were then washed twice with FACS buffer and 
analyzed by flow cytometry. Data were acquired using an LSRII cytometer (BD).
Quantification of phagocytosis
Phagocytosis was quantified using flow cytometry analysis (described above). Apoptotic 
thymocytes were stained with CellTrace Violet (Molecular Probes) or PKH26 (Sigma-
Aldrich) per manufacturer’s protocol. Percent phagocytosis equals the percentage of cells 
that have engulfed CellTrace Violet+ or PKH26+ apoptotic thymocytes.
Immunofluorescent staining and analysis of IgG and C1q deposition in kidney sections
Kidneys were harvested from animals at 32 weeks, 52 weeks, or 8 weeks after chronic 
apoptotic thymocyte injection (above). Organs were sectioned and mounted on slides. Slides 
were fixed with 4% formaldehyde for 20 minutes at 4°C. Following fixation, slides were 
blocked and permeabilized in block buffer (1% BSA, 0.1% Triton in PBS) for 1 hour at RT. 
Slides were washed extensively in TBS-Tween (Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% 
Tween-20), incubated with Alexa-Fluor 647-conjugated anti-IgG (Invitrogen) for 1 hour at 
RT, and mounted with VectaShield with DAPI (Vector Labs). Alternatively, slides were 
washed extensively in TBS-Tween (Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween-20), 
incubated with anti-C1q (clone 4.8, Abcam) for 1 hour at RT, washed again with TBS-
Tween, incubated with Cy3 conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch) 
and Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated wheat germ agglutinin (Molecular Probes) for 1 hour at RT, 
and mounted with VectaShield with DAPI (Vector Labs). Images were analyzed using an 
Olympus BX51 FL Microscope and Slidebook software. Masks were drawn around 
glomeruli, and MFI of anti-IgG or anti-C1q were calculated.
Cytokine detection
Supernatants were collected from macrophages fed with apoptotic thymocytes for 24 hours. 
Cytokines released into supernatant were analyzed by Luminex technologies (Millipore). 
Serum was collected from animals was analyzed by Luminex technologies (Millipore).
Detection of serum creatinine
The Veterinary Pathology Core at St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital measured serum 
creatinine.
Blood and urine clinical chemistry
The Veterinary Pathology Core at St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital assessed differential 
blood counts, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and proteinuria (albumin to creatitine ratio, 
ACR). The Clinical Pathology Core at the National Institute of Environmental Health 
Sciences performed blood urea nitrogen (BUN) analysis.

 Assessment of endocapillary proliferative glomerulonephritis (EPG)
Kidneys were harvested from 52-week-old mice. Organs were sectioned, fixed in 10% 
formalin, and embedded in paraffin. Four to six μm serial sections were cut, deparaffinized, 
rehydrated and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E). All slides were coded prior to 
evaluation, and only decoded upon collection of all data. Endocapillary proliferative 
glomerulonephritis (EPG), a glomerular disease pattern frequently associated with lupus 
nephritis, was assessed on a virtual scale ranging from 0 to 5, where “0” was considered 
“indistinguishable compared to wild type control” and “5” was considered “the maximal 
damage seen in all samples”, based on the classification of glomerulonephritis in systemic 
lupus erythematosus30. Features that influence this score are intraglomerular mesangial 
proliferation in relation to overall glomerular size, number of mesangial nuclei, intraluminal 
diameters of glomerular capillaries and the amount of mesangial matrix. Hematoxylin/eosin 
stained sections were used to score at least 24 glomeruli in a maximum of 4 different 
specimens obtained from each group.
Detection of anti-dsDNA antibodies and anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA)
The presence of anti-dsDNA antibodies in serum was tested using Mouse Anti-dsDNA Ig’s 
(Total A+G+M) ELISA Kit (Alpha Diagnostics International), per manufacturer’s protocol. 
The presence of anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA) in serum was tested using Mouse ANA/ENA 
Ig’s (Total A+G+M) ELISA Kit (Alpha Diagnostics International), per manufacturer’s 
protocol.
Detection of circulating autoantigen using Autoantigen Microarray
Autoantibody reactivities against a penal of 124 autoantigens were measured using an 
autoantigen microarray platform developed by University of Texas Southwestern Medical 
(https://microarray.swmed.edu/products/category/protein-array/). Briefly, serum samples 
were pretreated with DNAse-I and then diluted 1:50 in PBST buffer for autoantibody 
profiling. The autoantigen array bearing 124 autoantigens and 4 control proteins were 
printed in duplicates onto Nitrocellulose film slides (Grace Bio-Labs). The diluted serum 
samples were incubated with the autoantigen arrays, and autoantibodies were detected with 
cy3-labeled anti-mouse IgG and cy5-labeled anti-mouse IgM using a Genepix 4200A 
scanner (Molecular Device) with laser wavelength of 532 nm and 635 nm. The resulting 
images were analyzed using Genepix Pro 6.0 software (Molecular Devices). The median of 
the signal intensity for each spot were calculated and subtracted the local background around 
the spot, and data obtained from duplicate spots were averaged. The background subtracted 
signal intensity of each antigen was normalized to the average intensity of the total mouse 
IgG, which was included on the array as an internal control. Finally, the net fluorescence 
intensity (NFI) for each antigen was calculated by subtracting a PBS control which was 
included for each experiment as negative control. Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) was used as a 
quantitative measurement of the true signal above background noise. SNR values equal to or 
greater than 3 were considered significantly higher than background, and therefore true 
signals. The NFI of each autoantibody was used to generate heatmaps using Cluster and 
Treeview software (http://rana.bl.gov/EisenSoftware.htm). Each row in the heatmap 
represents an autoantibdy and each column represents a sample. Red color represents the

is lower than the mean value of the raw.
RNA extraction and Nanostring analysis
Total RNA was isolated from the spleens from 52-week-old mice using NucleoSpin II kit 
(Macherey-Nagel) according to the manufacturer’s instructions, and 50 ng was used to 
determine the absolute levels of gene expression. Hybridization and nCounter were 
performed according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Nanostring Technologies, Seattle, WA, 
USA). In brief, reactions were hybridized for 20h at 65°, after which the products were used 
to run on the nCounter preparation station for removal of excess probes. Data were collected 
with the nCounter digital analyzer by counting individual barcodes. Data generated from the 
nCounter digital analyzer were examined with the nCounter digital analyzer software system 
v2.1.1 (Nanostring Technologies). Data were normalized to the geometric means of spiked-
in positive controls (controls for assay efficiency) and spiked-in negative controls 
(normalized for background). The data were further normalized to the housekeeping genes 
Gapdh, Hprt, and Tubb5 and are reported as normalized RNA counts (means ± SEM). 
Nanostring RNA counts were analyzed with the Partek Genomic Suite (Partek, Inc., St. 
Louis, MO, USA), to identify significantly regulated probe. Heatmaps of Nanostring data 
were generated with the Partek Genomic Suite.
Statistical analysis
The statistical significance of differences in mean values was calculated using unpaired, 
two-tailed Student’s t test. p values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant.

A–D. 1×107, PKH26-labeled UV-irradiated wild-type thymocytes were injected 
intravenously into indicated animals expressing GFP-LC3. (A, B) Apoptotic thymocytes in 
spleen, liver, and kidney of indicated animals measured by flow cytometry. (C, D) Indicated 
serum cytokines. Error bars represent standard deviation (n=4, *p < 0.001, **p < 0.05). E. 
2×107, UV-irradiated wild-type thymocytes were injected intravenously six times over 8 
weeks into indicated animals (aged 6 weeks). Serum anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA, Total Ig) 
and anti-dsDNA antibodies (Total Ig) are shown at 16 wks. Results are presented as ratio to 
average value prior to injection for each individual animal. Error bars represent standard 
error (n=4, **p < 0.05). Cre indicates LysM-Cre. The color scheme represents LAP-
deficient, autophagy-deficient genotypes (green), autophagy-deficient, LAP-sufficient (red), 
and autophagy-sufficient, LAP-deficient (blue).

 Figure 4. Mice with LAP deficiencies display symptoms of an autoinflammatory disorder
(A–E). Indicated serum cytokines in co-housed 52 wk old animals. In all cases, Cre 
indicates LysM-Cre. Error bars represent standard deviation (*p < 0.001). Numbers of 
animals are provided in Supplemental Methods. Color scheme represents LAP-deficient, 
autophagy-deficient genotypes (green), autophagy-deficient, LAP-sufficient (red), and 
autophagy-sufficient, LAP-deficient (blue). Values for one cohort of TIM4+/+ and TIM4−/− 
animals are shown for comparison in all cases (black) in A–E.
