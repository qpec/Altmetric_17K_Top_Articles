OBJECTIVE
Our aim was to study the relation between the duration of full and any breastfeeding
and risk of type 1 diabetes.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS
We included two population-based cohorts of children followed from birth (1996–
2009) to 2014 (Denmark) or 2015 (Norway). We analyzeddata from a totalof 155,392
children participating in the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study (MoBa) and
the Danish National Birth Cohort (DNBC). Parents reported infant dietary practices
when their child was 6 and 18 months old. The outcome was clinical type 1 diabetes,
ascertained from nationwide childhood diabetes registries. Hazard ratios (HRs) were
estimated using Cox regression.
RESULTS
Type 1 diabetes was identified in 504 children during follow-up, and the incidence of
type 1 diabetes per 100,000 person-years was 30.5 in the Norwegian cohort and 23.5
inthe Danish cohort.Childrenwho were neverbreastfedhada twofold increasedrisk
of type 1 diabetes compared with those who were breastfed (HR 2.29 [95% CI 1.14–
4.61] for no breastfeeding vs. any breastfeeding for ‡12 months). Among those who
were breastfed, however, the incidence of type 1 diabetes was independent of
duration of both full breastfeeding (HR per month 0.99 [95% CI 0.97–1.01]) and
any breastfeeding (0.97 [0.92–1.03]).
CONCLUSIONS
Suggestive evidence supports the contention that breastfeeding reduces the risk of
type 1 diabetes. Among those who were breastfed, however, no evidence indicated
that prolonging full or any breastfeeding was associated with a reduced risk of type 1
diabetes.
Type 1 diabetes is a common disease in childhood, and the Nordic countries have
some of the highest incidence rates in the world. Type 1 diabetes results from
immune-mediated destruction of pancreatic b-cells, eventually leading to complete
and lifelong dependence on exogenous insulin (1). Although genetic susceptibility
variants play a role in the development of type 1 diabetes, increased incidence over
the past 50 years strongly suggests an important role for nongenetic factors (2–4). The
hypothesis that breastfeeding could protect against type 1 diabetes was proposed
more than 30 years ago, supported by ecological and retrospective case-control data
from Denmark and Norway (5). Human milk contains biologically active substances,
including antibodies, cytokines, and hormones, that may influence the infant immune

 system (6). A number of biologically plau-
sible mechanisms have been hypothe-
sized for the potential protective effect
of breast milk against type 1 diabetes,
such as protection against potentially
diabetogenic infections, postponed ex-
posure to dietary antigens including
cow’s milk, healthier infant gut micro-
biota, and optimal maturation of the in-
fant gut (7).
Breastfeeding has been associated
with a number of positive health out-
comes, and a possible protective effect
against type 1 diabetes in children has
been cited as evidence for the impor-
tance of breastfeeding (8,9). Previous
systematic reviews and meta-analyses of
observational studies have suggested
that breastfeeding more than 3 months
(10,11), and exclusive breastfeeding for
more than 2 weeks (12), are associated
with an approximately 15–30% lower
risk of type 1 diabetes. However, data
were almost exclusively from case-control
studies (8,10–12) and therefore suscep-
tible to recall bias and selection bias. Re-
cent prospective studies of genetically
susceptible children have had limitedv-
sample sizes and inconsistent results
(13–15). Therefore, the role of breast-
feeding, and whether an optimal duration
of breastfeeding exists with respect to
risk of type 1 diabetes, is unclear. We
set out to investigate whether an associ-
ation exists between breastfeeding dura-
tion and risk of development of type 1
diabetes in two of the world’s larg-
est birth cohorts from Norway and
Denmark.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS
Participants and Design
We used information from two popula-
tion-based pregnancy cohorts, the Nor-
wegian Mother and Child Cohort Study
(MoBa) (16) and the Danish NationalBirth
Cohort (DNBC) (17). MoBa participants
were recruited across Norway from
1999 to 2008, and DNBC participants
were recruited across Denmark from
1996 to 2003. A total of 155,392 children,
of whom 504 developed type 1 diabetes,
were eligible for the study (Fig. 1). Partic-
ipants in both cohorts gave written in-
formed consent. The establishment of
and data collection in MoBa were ap-
proved by the Norwegian Data Inspector-
ate and the Regional Committee for
Medical Research Ethics. DNBC was ap-
proved by the Danish Data Protection
Agency and the National Committee on
Biomedical Research Ethics.
Assessment of Breastfeeding
and Infant Diet
Information about infant feeding was de-
rived from mailed questionnaires admin-
istered to the mothers in MoBa and from
structured telephone interviews of the
mothers in DNBC; questionnaires and
interviews were administered when
the children were 6 and 18 months
old. Information about breastfeeding in
MoBa was derived from three main ques-
tions in the questionnaire, administered
when the infants were aged 6 months.
The first question asked what the child
had to drink during the first week after
birth; the options were breast milk, wa-
ter, sugar water, formula, other, and
don’t know. The second question, which
was also included in the questionnaire ad-
ministered at age 18 months, asked what
kind of milk the child received during the
first 6 and 18 months of life. The possible
answerswerebreastmilk,differenttypesof
formula, and other milk. The answers were
reported at monthly intervals for the first
6 months and at 3-month intervals thereaf-
ter. For both the first and the second ques-
tions, more than one type of drink could be
marked. The third question asked when the
child was introduced to solid food, with a
total of 17 different alternative responses.
Information about breastfeeding in
DNBC was derived from four main ques-
tions in the interview administered at age
6 months. The first question was also in-
cluded in the interview administered at
age 18 months and asked whether the
mother was currently breastfeeding. If
not currently breastfeeding, she was
Figure 1—Flowchart showing participants from the MoBa (A) and the DNBC (B) included in the
analysis. *In MoBa, 95,200 mothers participated during one or more pregnancies (40.6% of eligible
pregnancies). In DNBC, 91,326 mothers participated during one or more pregnancies (about 30% of
eligible mothers). †The DNBC interviewwhen the infantswere 6 months old did not include detailed
questions about age at introduction of formula until April 2000, resulting in missing data for age at
introduction of formula and thus also for duration of full breastfeeding for 12,402 of the 66,676
children whose mothers completed the 6-month interview (including 48 children with type 1
diabetes [T1D]).

 asked whether the child was ever
breastfed and, if yes, when the mother
stopped breastfeeding her child. The sec-
ond, third, and fourth questions asked
when the child was introduced to differ-
ent types of formula, other milk, and solid
food, respectively. The answers were re-
ported in months, weeks, and days.
Definitions of Breastfeeding
Full breastfeeding means that the infant
received breast milk, allowing water-
based drinks in addition to vitamin supple-
ments, but not formula, solid foods, or
semisolid foods. Any breastfeeding means
that the infant received breast milk, re-
gardless of complementary feeding.
Assessment of Study End Point: Type 1
Diabetes
We used time to clinical diagnosis of
type 1 diabetes as the outcome. Data on
type 1 diabetes in MoBa was obtained
from the Norwegian Childhood Diabetes
Registry (4) and the Norwegian Patient
Registry. We linked DNBC to the Danish
Childhood Diabetes Registry (18). In total,
for the two cohorts, 504 children with
type 1 diabetes with information on in-
fant feeding at 6 months of age were
identified during follow-up (Fig. 1).
Other Variables
We included as covariates in regression
models parent and child characteristics
that might influence both infant feeding
practices and development of type 1 di-
abetes: parental type 1 diabetes (for
DNBC, only maternal diabetes of any
type), infant sex, mode of delivery, infant
birth weight, gestational age at delivery,
and the mother’s parity, age at delivery,
education, smoking during pregnancy,
and BMI before pregnancy. Parental
characteristics were obtained from the
baseline questionnaire at week 18 of
pregnancy in MoBa, and from interviews
at weeks 12 and 30 of pregnancy and at
infant age 18 months in DNBC. Maternal
type 1 diabetes was obtained from the
Norwegian Patient Registry and the ques-
tionnaire at week 18 of pregnancy in
MoBa, and maternal diabetes of any
type was identified from the interview
at week 12 of pregnancy in DNBC. In
addition, paternal type 1 diabetes was
available from the Norwegian Patient
Registry for the MoBa cohort. Informa-
tion on infant sex, mode of delivery, and
infant birth weight was obtained from
the national medical birth registries. In-
formation on gestational age in MoBa
was obtained from the Medical Birth
Registry of Norway, and in DNBC from
the interview at infant age 6 months.
Data Analysis
WeusedCoxregressionanalysistoestimate
hazardratios(HRs)with95%CIswithineach
cohort. Follow-up time was counted from
date of birth to the first date of type 1 di-
abetes diagnosis or the end of follow-up
(9 December 2015 in MoBa and 6 Novem-
ber 2014 in DNBC). We used robust cluster
variance estimation to correct for within-
family correlation. We assessed and tested
the proportional hazard assumption of the
Cox model using Schoenfeld residuals. Re-
sults from the two cohorts were combined
using a random effects model (the Metan
procedureinStatasoftwareversion14).We
defined statistical significance as P , 0.05,
or 95% CIs for the HR not including 1.00.
Heterogeneity of associations between
the two cohorts was examined using the
Cochran Q test. In a sensitivity analysis,
we assessed the impact of missing data
using multiple imputation, as described in
the Supplementary Data.
RESULTS
Cohort characteristics are shown in Table
1. The mean age ofthe childrenat the end
of follow-up was 10.2 years (range 0.7–
15.9) in MoBa and 14.0 years (range 0.9–
16.7) in DNBC. The mean age at clinical
diagnosis of type 1 diabetes was 6.7 years
(range 0.7–14.1) in MoBa, and 8.5 years
(range 0.9–15.8) in DNBC. The overall
incidence of type 1 diabetes per 100,000
person-years was 30.5 in MoBa and
23.5 in DNBC. The incidence of type 1
diabetes among participants excluded
because of insufficient information on in-
fant diet did not differ from the incidence
among those included in this analysis
(Supplementary Fig. 1). Furthermore,
participants with and without complete
information were generally similar with
regard to background characteristics, ex-
cept that mothers without complete infor-
mation in MoBa had lower education and
parity, and more frequently smoked dur-
ing pregnancy than mothers with com-
plete information in MoBa. In DNBC,
children without complete information
had a lower birth weight and were more
likely to be born via cesarean delivery
(Supplementary Table 1).
Breastfeeding was never initiated for
0.8% of MoBa participants and 2.4% of
DNBC participants. Children who were
never breastfed had lower birth weight
and younger gestational age, and were
more likely to be born via cesarean de-
livery than children who were breastfed.
Moreover, their mothers had less educa-
tion and were more likely to be obese
(Supplementary Table 2). Full breastfeed-
ingfor6 monthsormore wasreportedfor
13.8% of infants in MoBa and 6.3% of
infants in DNBC, whereas any breastfeed-
ing for 12 months or more was reported
for 38.5% of infants in MoBa and 20.2% of
infants in DNBC (Supplementary Table 3).
Never being breastfed was associ-
ated with a twofold higher risk for de-
veloping type 1 diabetes compared with
those who were breastfed (HR 2.29
[95% CI 1.14–4.61] for no breastfeeding
compared with any breastfeeding for
$12 months; HR 2.31 [95% CI 1.11–
4.80] for no breastfeeding compared
with full breastfeeding for $6 months)
(Fig. 2). However, we found no difference
in type 1 diabetes risk by duration of ei-
ther full or any breastfeeding for those
who initiated at least some breastfeed-
ing. The pooled HR (trend) per month
was not significant for full breastfeeding
(0.99 [95% CI 0.97–1.01]) or any breast-
feeding (0.97 [95% CI 0.92–1.03]). Be-
cause of the nonlinearity (apparent
threshold effect for no breastfeeding),
we also estimated (post hoc) the trend
in risk of type 1 diabetes per month in-
crease in breastfeeding after excluding
those not breastfed. This gave essentially
unchangedtrendestimatesbuthigherP val-
ues (P . 0.70) (Supplementary Table 3).
Furthermore,we found no associations
of early or late introduction of formula or
solid foods with type 1 diabetes (Table 2).
Breastfeeding while introducing solid
foods was also not associated with
type 1 diabetes (Table 2).
Sensitivity Analyses
The potential impact of missing data on
our results was assessed using multi-
ple imputation, as described in the
Supplementary Data. Multiple imputa-
tiondid not change anyofthe conclusions
(Supplementary Fig. 2). Excluding chil-
dren with a parent affected by diabetes
also did not change the conclusion based
on the entire sample (Supplementary
Table 4). MoBa and DNBC consist mainly,
but not exclusively, of ethnic Norwegians
and Danes, respectively. For participants
in MoBa, we repeated the main analyses
after adjusting for ethnic group (ascer-
tained by reported parental native

 language), and this did not change the
conclusions (Supplementary Table 5). In-
formation on ethnicity was not available
in DNBC.
CONCLUSIONS
Our key findings are that children never
breastfed had a twofold increased risk
for developing type 1 diabetes, and
thatdperhaps most importantdno
clinically relevant difference in risk was
found for those with different durations
of either full or any breastfeeding among
those who ever breastfed.
Comparison With Previous Studies
The majority of previous population-
based studies of breastfeeding duration
and risk of type 1 diabetes have been
retrospective case-control studies (12),
and the few population-based prospec-
tive studies (19–21) included few chil-
dren with type 1 diabetes or had very
limited information about breastfeeding
(see Supplementary Table 6 for an over-
view of previous studies in the field with
type 1 diabetes as the outcome). While a
2012 meta-analysis of mainly retrospec-
tive case-control studies suggested an
approximately 15–30% reduced risk
of type 1 diabetes in those breastfed
for more than 3 months or exclusively
breastfed for more than 2 weeks (12),
we focused our comparison with previous
publications on cohort studies, which are
less prone to biases. Some evidence for
associations of breastfeeding duration
with type 1 diabetes have been found in
genetically high-risk birth cohorts (13),
but others did not find any such associa-
tion (14,15). These prospective studies
following children with genetic or familial
risk included only a limited number of
children who developed type 1 diabetes,
compared with our study, and did not
study the group who did not breastfeed.
No significant associations have been re-
ported between breastfeeding duration
and islet autoimmunity, a surrogate end
point for type 1 diabetes, in genetically
high-risk birth cohorts (13,14,22,23).
(See Supplementary Table 7 for a brief
overview of published cohort studies of
breastfeeding and islet autoimmunity.)
The largest of the latter studies, Diabetes
Prediction and Prevention (DIPP), re-
ported suggestive but nonsignificant asso-
ciations between duration of breastfeeding
and islet autoimmunity, with HRs around
1.4 when comparing the lower with the
upper third of the cohort distribution of
breastfeeding duration (22). The trend es-
timates in our study can be used to com-
pute HRs with CIs for different contrasts
in breastfeeding duration. For a contrast
of 3 months of any breastfeeding (e.g.,
comparing 9 and 12 months’ duration),
the adjusted HR would be 0.97 (95% CI
0.82–1.15). For full breastfeeding, a
3-month difference (e.g., comparing 6
with 3 months’ duration) would give a
model-based adjusted HR of 0.97 (95% CI
0.90–1.04). Because our 95% CIs for the
trend analyses largely excluded relative
risks of magnitudes suggested by previ-
ous retrospective or prospective studies,
our results are not compatible with pre-
viously published results.
In line with previous population-based
studies (13,15), we found no evidence for

 an association between age at introduc-
tion of formula and development of
type 1 diabetes. This is also concurrent
with results from the randomized Trial
to Reduce IDDM in the Genetically at
Risk (TRIGR) study, showing that weaning
to a highly hydrolyzed formula, compared
with regular cow’s milk formula, was not
associated with a decreased risk of multi-
ple islet autoantibodies (24). It should,
however, be noted that the intervention
in the TRIGR study did not directly
address the effect of breastfeeding or in-
take of other complementary foods.
Only a few cohorts of genetically sus-
ceptible childrenhavebeenanalyzedwith
regard to age at introduction of solids in
relation to type 1 diabetes (see the
Supplementary Data for an overview of
previous studies in the field). DNBC
showed a tendency toward a higher risk
for those who received solid foods before
age 6 months, although this was not sig-
nificant and not seen in MoBa or in the
pooled analysis, supporting the sugges-
tion that the DNBC results may have
been due to chance. The lack of associa-
tion between age at introduction of any
solid food, or breastfeeding while intro-
ducing any solid food, and development
of type 1 diabetes is in line with results
from the Environmental Triggers of Type
1 Diabetes (MIDIA) study (13). However,
introduction to any solid food before
4 months and after 6 months of age pre-
dicted development of type 1 diabetes
in the Diabetes Autoimmunity Study in
the Young (DAISY) (15). Breastfeeding
while introducing wheat/barley was also
associated with a lower risk of developing
type 1 diabetes, but breastfeeding while
introducing other solid foods was not
(15). We found no association between
the age at introduction of specific solid
foods, including vegetables and fruits and
berries, or breastfeeding while introducing
specific solid foods, and type 1 diabetes.
Virtanen et al. (22) reported from the
DIPP study a significant association be-
tween early introduction of root vegeta-
bles and risk of islet autoimmunity, but
they included no separate analysis with
type 1 diabetes as the end point. Cultural
differences in infant feeding practices
could influence the ability to directly
compare results between the different
prospective studies. In line with Nordic
nutrition recommendations (25), few of
the infants in our study were introduced
to any solid food before age 4 months
(6.0% in MoBa and 7.5% in DNBC), in con-
trast to 43.0% in DAISY from Colorado
(15). Our results are probably generaliz-
able to many other industrialized coun-
tries, but may not be applicable to
populations of non-European origin.
Strengths and Weaknesses
The main strengths of the study are the
prospective design, large sample size,
linkage to national registries with a high
level of ascertainment, and inclusion of
two independent cohorts with consis-
tent results. Missing data on infant feed-
ing was mainly the result of a loss to
follow-up, as occurs in all cohorts based
on voluntary participation and question-
naires or interviews. The similar risk of
type 1 diabetes in those with or without
complete infant feeding data, combined
with multiple imputation analysis, sug-
gest that bias resulting from missing
data was not a serious problem. Relatively
few children were not breastfed at all,

 and some uncertainty existed around the
HR estimate for this specific group, which
calls for a careful interpretation of this
particular finding. While infant feeding
practices were recorded typically many
years before the children developed
type 1 diabetes (no children developed
type 1 diabetes before 6 months of
age), the mothers inevitably had to recall
their practices used a few months before
the actual assessment. MoBa had infor-
mation about type 1 diabetes in both the
mother and the father, whereas DNBC
had information about maternal diabetes
of any type. While maternal type 1

Data are n (%) unless otherwise indicated. *Adjusted for sex, birth weight, gestational age, cesarean delivery, parity, maternal smoking during pregnancy,
maternal age, maternal BMI, and parental diabetes. †Age at introduction of any solid foods after 6 months was set to 6.5 months in trend analysis
using continuous months. Age at introduction of other milk after 18 months was set to 18.5 months. ‡No significant heterogeneity existed between
the studies for any of the comparisons (all P values .0.05). §In the MoBa cohort, no significant associations were found between type 1 diabetes (T1D)
and age at introduction of or breastfeeding while introducing the following food groups: cereals, gluten-containing food, vegetables, meat/fish, and
fruits/berries (data not shown). DNBC did not have information on specific food items. PY, person-years.

 diabetes is a potential confounder be-
cause it is associated with both the child’s
risk of type 1 diabetes and possibly infant
feeding, its actual impact as a confounder
of our results is likely to be minor because
maternal type 1 diabetes was very rare
(,0.5% of the cohort). The study is ob-
servational, so we cannot exclude the
possibility that unmeasured confounders
influenced the results. On the other hand,
no established environmental etiological
factors are obvious confounders. While
only a randomized trial design can elimi-
nateconfounding, itisdifficulttoimagine,
for ethical and logistical reasons, a ran-
domized controlled trial of breastfeeding
duration with sufficient power to detect
effects on type 1 diabetes.
Potential Mechanisms and
Implications for Policy
Assuming the higher risk of type 1 diabe-
tes in those who were not breastfed com-
pared with those who were breastfed was
not a result of bias or confounding, a pos-
sible interpretation of our findings is that
substances in the colostrum mediate a
protective effect. Colostrum is secreted
the first 3–5 days after birth and contains
high concentrations of immune factors,
which decrease in mature milk (26). Breast-
feeding could lead to a healthier infant
gut microbiota profile at an early stage
of life compared with infants who are
never breastfed (27,28). Preliminary ob-
servations indicate that a difference in
the gut microbiome exists between chil-
dren with autoimmunity or type 1 diabe-
tes and healthy children (29).
The finding with the most important im-
plications for policy and public health is
perhaps the lack of an association between
the duration of either full or any breast-
feeding and risk of type 1 diabetes. A pos-
sible preventive effect of a longer duration
of breastfeeding is sometimes cited in re-
views of the evidence for breastfeeding
recommendations (8,9). This can lead
to a sense of guilt among mothers of chil-
dren who develop type 1 diabetes, if the
mother did not fully comply with the
recommendations for duration of breast-
feeding. Our results suggest suchmothers
need not feel guilty. This is also an impor-
tant message for clinicians diagnosing
children with type 1 diabetes.
Conclusion
The results from two of the world’s largest
birth cohorts provide suggestive evi-
dence for the hypothesis that initiating
breastfeeding may reduce the risk of
type 1 diabetes. However, among those
who were breastfed, our study provides
strong evidence against a clinically impor-
tant association with prolonging full or any
breastfeeding and risk of type 1 diabetes.
