The Young Male Cigarette and Alcohol
Syndrome: Smoking and Drinking
as a Short-Term Mating Strategy
Eveline Vincke1
Abstract
Despite the many health risks of tobacco and alcohol use, high levels of smoking and drinking are being persisted. Moreover,
young men engage more in these behaviors as compared to women. As male physical risk-taking behavior gains attractiveness
in short-term mating contexts and given that smoking and drinking have considerable physical costs, this study explores the
possibility that tobacco and alcohol use is part of a male short-term mating strategy. By means of a between-subjects experiment
(N ¼ 239), women’s perceptions of young male smoking and drinking were investigated. The experiment showed that women
perceive men who smoke and drink as being more short-term oriented in their sexuality than nonusers. Moreover, both tobacco
and (especially) alcohol use brought some attractiveness benefits in short-term mating contexts. A follow-up study (N ¼ 171)
confirmed that men’s behavior corresponds with women’s perceptions. Overall, these findings show that cigarette and alcohol
use can operate as a short-term mating strategy.

Introduction
Smoking cigarettes and drinking alcohol at a young age are
known to bring adverse consequences to its users. For instance,
in the short run, smoking leads to poor lung functioning and
rapid fatigue during physical activity (American Cancer Soci-
ety, 2014). Alcohol, on the other hand, causes drunkenness and
alcohol poisoning, leading to headaches, coma, or even death
(Fuller et al., 2013; National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and
Alcoholism, 2015). Moreover, because of the addictive
effects, early tobacco and alcohol use leads to dependency
later in life, causing a high disease and premature death risk
(Brown et al., 2008; Doll, Peto, Boreham, & Sutherland, 2004;
Ellickson, Tucker, & Klein, 2001, 2003; Jha et al., 2013; World
Health Organization, 2014).
However, despite all dangers, smoking and drinking peak
during young adulthood (Johnston, O’Malley, Bachman, Schu-
lenberg, & Miech, 2014; Substance Abuse and Mental Health
Services Administration [SAMHSA], 2014). Corresponding
with most research findings on risk-taking behavior (Betz &
Weber, 2002; Byrnes, Miller, & Schafer, 1999) and the young
male syndrome (stating that risky behavior is found most
frequently among the sex with the highest reproductive com-
petition; Fischer & Hills, 2012; Wilson & Daly, 1985), these
high numbers of youth smoking and drinking are mostly attri-
butable to young men (Ahlstro
¨m & O
¨ sterberg, 2005;
SAMHSA, 2014; Johnston, Bachman, & Schulenberg, 2012;
Poelen, Scholte, Engels, Boomsma, & Willemsen, 2005).
Accordingly, there might be underlying motivations for young
men who surpass the harmful consequences of both unhealthy
consumption behaviors.
Studies already showed that men attune their risky courtship
displaying behavior to female desires, depending on the sexual
strategy that is being followed (Ellis et al., 2012; Frankenhuis
& Karremans, 2012). Furthermore, in accordance with the
female preference for physical qualities in short-term mating

 situations, studies demonstrated that physical risk taking is
especially attractive in short-term mating contexts (Bassett &
Moss, 2004; Kelly & Dunbar, 2001; Sylwester & Pawłowski,
2011). Consequently, in this article, we aim to explore the
hypothesis that male smoking and drinking behavior—being
risky physical consumption behaviors—are used as a male
short-term mating strategy. By means of two studies, the
functioning of tobacco and alcohol use as a short-term sexual
strategy is explored.
Male Risk Taking as a Sexual Strategy
Because of the high reproductive costs when making a poor
mating decision (Trivers, 1972), women are selective when
choosing a short-term sexual partner as well as a long-term
romantic partner (Buss & Schmitt, 1993; Li & Kenrick,
2006). Accordingly, men are forced to strive for mating oppor-
tunities through competitive behavior and courtship displays in
both mating contexts (Buss, 2007; Geary, 2006; Kenrick,
Sadalla, Groth, & Melanie, 1990). This is especially the case
for young men, experiencing the highest level of competition
and the greatest variation in reproductive success (Daly &
Wilson, 2001; Ellis et al., 2012; Wilson & Daly, 1985). Which
qualities are being displayed by men depends on women’s
preferences and on the sexual strategy that is followed (Buss,
2006; Saad, 2013).
When searching for a long-term partner, women prefer a
man who has the willingness and capacity to protect and care
for children. Consequently, women are attracted to kind men,
physically strong men, and especially men with resources and
status (Buss & Schmitt, 1993; Li, Bailey, Kenrick, & Linsen-
meier, 2002). In short-term mating, on the other hand, a man’s
genetic quality is most important. Accordingly, women place
greater value on a man’s physical attractiveness (Buss &
Schmitt, 1993; Li & Kenrick, 2006), making men with symme-
trical faces and masculine features more desirable (Little,
Jones, Penton-Voak, Burt, & Perrett, 2002; Provost, Troje, &
Quinsey, 2008; Puts, 2005).
Men’s risk-taking behavior corresponds with these female
preferences. Both physical risk taking (Frankenhuis, Dotsch,
Karremans, & Wigboldus, 2010; Pawlowski, Atwal, & Dunbar,
2008; Ronay & Hippel, 2010) and financially risky decision
making (Baker & Maner, 2008; McAlvanah, 2009; Wilson &
Daly, 2004) are stimulated in a mating mind-set. Moreover,
findings indicate that these male risky behaviors are strategic
courtship displays, as men limit their risky signaling to situa-
tions where the odds of gaining reproductive benefits are high.
For instance, young men are inclined to take more risks when
exposed to a women, but only when she is attractive (Baker &
Maner, 2008) and single (Baker & Maner, 2009). Moreover,
only uncommitted men increase their risk taking in the pres-
ence of women, while taking into account women’s preferences
(Frankenhuis & Karremans, 2012).
In addition, the attractiveness of risk takers depends on the
type of risk as well as the mating context. Corresponding with
female desires, physical risk taking enhances male
attractiveness, especially in short-term mating contexts (Bas-
sett & Moss, 2004; Kelly & Dunbar, 2001; Sylwester &
Pawłowski, 2011). Moreover, in short-term sexual encounters,
physical risk takers are preferred over social or financial risk
takers (Sylwester & Pawłowski, 2011). In long-term mating
contexts, on the other hand, women generally prefer risk avoi-
ders (Sylwester & Pawłowski, 2011), except when it concerns
heroic risk taking (Farthing, 2005) or moderate physical risk
taking, carrying less danger for the partner and children (Bas-
sett & Moss, 2004; Farthing, 2007; Kelly & Dunbar, 2001).
Tobacco and Alcohol Use as a Short-Term
Mating Strategy
Because of the many—short-term and long-term—negative
health consequences, smoking cigarettes and drinking alcohol
can be considered forms of physical risk taking. Given this
physical risk inherent to smoking and drinking, women’s pre-
ference for male physical risk taking in short-term mating con-
texts, and the fact that men adapt their risky behavior to the
preferences of women, we propose that smoking and drinking
behavior could be used by men as a short-term sexual courtship
strategy. Accordingly, smoking and drinking should be engaged
in more by men having an unrestricted, short-term-oriented
sexuality, while bringing short-term attractiveness benefits.
In line with these assumptions, studies show that there is a
strong link between drinking alcohol and engaging in casual
sexual relationships (Grello, Welsh, & Harper, 2006; Lindgren,
Pantalone, Lewis, & George, 2009; Turchik, Garske, Probst, &
Irvin, 2010). Similarly, recent studies indicate that the high
participation of men in drinking games can be (partially)
explained by men’s higher mating efforts and higher sexual
motivation (Hone, Carter, & Mccullough, 2013; Hone &
McCullough, 2015). Furthermore, also smoking seems to be
related to following a more risky and short-term-oriented sex-
ual approach (Farid, Rus, Dahlui, Al-Sadat, & Aziz, 2014;
La
˚ngstro
¨m & Hanson, 2006), in which young adults putting a
lot of effort in attracting sexual partners are more willing to
smoke in social situations (Jones & Figueredo, 2007). In addi-
tion, Hill and Chow (2002) link risky drinking to reproductive
success in young men. Some studies contradict the assumed
attractiveness benefits of heavy alcohol and tobacco use in
men. However, women were asked to rate these men on their
general desirability. Hence, in accordance with evolved long-
term female desires, no preferences for physical risk-taking
behavior were found (Farthing, 2005; Van Den Abbeele,
Penton-Voak, Attwood, Stephen, & Munafo, 2015; Wilke,
Hutchinson, Todd, & Kruger, 2006). Corresponding with
risk-taking literature, moderate alcohol use did enhance men’s
general attractiveness (Van Den Abbeele et al., 2015).
Current Research
As scientific literature points into the direction of smoking and
drinking as a male short-term mating strategy, we expect men’s
smoking and drinking frequency to affect women’s perception.

Evolutionary Psychology
 More specifically, we believe that a higher smoking and drinking
frequency will lead to a more harmful impression of a young
man’s overall behavior (Hypothesis 1). Additionally, we expect
that women will infer a man’s short-term mating strategy from
his smoking and drinking behavior (Hypothesis 2). Also, tobacco
and alcohol use will bring attractiveness benefits to young adult
men (Hypothesis 3). Corresponding with risk-taking literature,
we expect occasional smoking and drinking, being moderate
risky behaviors, to bring attractiveness benefits in both short-
term and long-term mating situations (Hypothesis 3a). However,
heavy smoking and drinking will only bring attractiveness ben-
efits in short-term mating contexts (Hypothesis 3b). Further-
more, if smoking and drinking function as a short-term mating
strategy because of its physical harmfulness, women’s percep-
tions will be mediated by how unhealthy and risky they perceive
a man’s behavior to be (Hypothesis 4). By means of an experi-
mental study, women’s perceptions as a function of men’s smok-
ing and drinking behavior were explored.
In addition, for tobacco and alcohol use to function as a
short-term sexual strategy, women’s perceptions must corre-
spond with men’s actual behavior. Therefore, we expect users
of tobacco and alcohol to have a more short-term-oriented
mating strategy compared to nonusers (Hypothesis 5). More-
over, we expect to find a correlation between young male
users’ smoking and drinking behavior and their level of sexual
unrestrictedness that matches with the findings of Hypothesis
2 (Hypothesis 6). A follow-up study verified the sexual strategy
of young male users and nonusers.
Study 1: The Perception of Male
Smoking and Drinking Behavior
Material and Method
Participants
Following the young adult life stage proposed by Levinson
(1986), women between the age of 17 and 30 were approached
to participate in an online experiment. Due to attractiveness-
related questions, data of participants with a homosexual orien-
tation were excluded. Participants who indicated being male or
outside the young adult age range and participants with largely
incomplete questionnaires were also removed from the data set.
The final sample consisted of 239 Flemish women (Mage ¼
21.09, SD ¼ 2.22), living in the Dutch-speaking part of Bel-
gium. In Belgium, alcohol can be legally sold in shops or bars
to youngsters from 16 years old. Only when it concerns liquors,
the age limit rises to 18 years. Similarly, it is illegal to sell
cigarettes to youngsters under 16 years old (www.belgium.be).
Design
To investigate whether women perceive men’s sexual strategy
and attractiveness differently depending on their smoking and
drinking behavior, an online between-subjects experimental
design was used. More specifically, a factorial survey
experiment was conducted, in which vignettes (profiles), vary-
ing (an) experimental factor(s), were used to assess the impact
of behavioral traits on evaluations (Auspurg & Hinz, 2015).
This research approach was chosen for because it has proven
useful in the studying of risky behaviors (Bassett & Moss,
2004; Kelly & Dunbar, 2001; Sylwester & Pawłowski, 2011)
and signaling behavior (Sundie et al., 2011).
Stimuli and Procedure
For this study, behavioral profiles (vignettes) were created in
which the hobbies of a typical young male were described in
circa 70 words. In total, 10 sets of profiles were created. Two
sets of profiles addressed a young man’s smoking and drinking
behavior. The eight other profile sets focused on other beha-
viors, both positive (e.g., playing sports) and negative (e.g.,
sunbathing), yet are not discussed in this article. Each profile
set consisted of three versions, varying the main character’s
behavioral frequency. All three profile versions were identical,
except for the final sentence stating that a person did not
engage, occasionally engaged, or frequently engaged in either
smoking or drinking (see Appendix).
To present the vignettes to the participants, three online
links were created via the program ‘‘Thesistools.’’ The three
links displayed all 10 behavioral profiles in the same order, yet
varied which of the three versions of a profile set was pre-
sented. For instance, when opening the first link, women were
asked to rate an occasional smoker and a frequent alcohol
drinker, followed by the other profiles.
The attractiveness of the main characters was assessed by
asking the following question: ‘‘Based on the profile you
just read, how attractive would you find this person as a
potential partner in the following situations? (a) a short-
term relationship (a date, one-night stand, casual relation-
ship, etc.) and (b) a long-term relationship (loyal, commit-
ted relationship, marriage)’’. Both questions were measured
on a 7-point Likert-type scale ranging from 1 (not at all
attractive) to 7 (very attractive).
To investigate whether a man’s short-term mating strategy is
inferred from his tobacco and alcohol use, participants were also
instructed to fill in the 3 attitudinal items of the Sociosexual
Inventory (SOI; Simpson & Gangestad, 1991) from the target’s
perspective (Sundie et al., 2011). More specifically, participants
were asked to indicate: To what extent do you think the person in
the profile would agree with the following statements? Answer
this question as you think the main character from the profile
would reply. For instance, the participating women indicated to
whatdegreethe personofthepersonalityprofile wouldagree with
the statement Sex without love is OK. All answers were given on a
7-point Likert-type scale, ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7
(highly agree), a higher score meaning a more short-term-
oriented, unrestricted, sexual strategy. For both the smoking- and
alcohol-related vignettes, a new variable computed the mean
score of the three questions (aSmoking ¼ .68, aDrinking ¼ .77).
Lastly, participants were also asked to indicate how harmful
they considered the overall behavior of the target individual to
Vincke
3
 be in terms of unhealthiness and riskiness: Based on the profile
you just read, to what extent do you agree with the following
statements (a) This person behaves in an unhealthy manner (b)
This person behaves in a risky manner. Here also, answers were
giving on a 7-point Likert-type scale, ranging from 1 (abso-
lutely not) to 7 (very much).
Participants agreeing to take part in the study randomly
received one of the three online links. All participants were
informed that they would be taking part in an experiment con-
cerning the perception of behavior. Participants were also
assured of their anonymity and of the confidentiality of their
answers. Subsequently, all participants read the short vignettes.
Each behavioral profile was followed by the three measures
(attractiveness, SOI, and perceived behavioral harmfulness).
Statistical Analysis
The statistical analysis consisted of analysis of variance
(ANOVA) for Hypotheses 1–3, and mediation analysis for
Hypothesis 4, by means of SPSS Version 21. When a mixed
ANOVA was conducted (Hypotheses 1 and 3), significant main
effects were reported via pairwise comparisons, whereas sig-
nificant interaction effects were interpreted by means of simple
effects analyses, assessed via the SPSS syntax (Field, 2013).
For the univariate ANOVA (Hypothesis 2), significant main
effects were followed by means of Tukey post hoc testing.
To study whether women’s perceptions are mediated by the
perceived overall behavioral unhealthiness and riskiness
(Hypothesis 4), mediation analyses were conducted, using Model
4 of the PROCESS procedure of Hayes (2013; http://www.af-
hayes.com). Separate mediation analyses were preferred over the
use of multiple mediators because of the high correlation between
the two potential mediators riskiness and unhealthiness, for both
the smoking profiles and the drinking profiles (rSmoking ¼ .46, p <
.001; rDrinking ¼ .55, p < .001). Only in the case of distinct med-
iators,a model withtwomediatorsisconsideredmore appropriate
(Kenny, Kashy, & Bolger, 1998). Given the three conditions of
the independent variable ‘‘profile version’’ (no usage, occasional
usage, and frequent usage), three dummy variables were created
to compare all conditions(occasional usage vs. nousage,frequent
usage vs. no usage, and frequent usage vs. occasional usage). To
test the underlying process, bias-corrected bootstrapping was
used—with 5,000 bootstrap samples—to generate 95% confi-
dence intervals around the indirect effect (a � b) of the overall
behavioral impressions. Mediation occurs if the confidence inter-
vals around the indirect effects exclude zero.
Results
The Impact of Smoking and Drinking
on Perceived Behavioral Harmfulness
To study Hypothesis 1, two mixed ANOVAs (one for smoking
behavior and one for drinking behavior) were conducted with
perceived unhealthiness and riskiness as dependent variables in
the within-subjects factor ‘‘harmfulness.’’ Profile version
served as between-subjects factor, representing the three beha-
vioral levels: never, occasionally, and frequently.
As can be seen in Table 1, there was a significant main
effect of the within-subjects factor harmfulness as well as the
between-subjects factor profile version, for both the smoking
and the drinking profiles. In addition, results showed signifi-
cant interaction effects between perceived riskiness and
unhealthiness as a function of usage frequency.
For the smoking profiles, the significant main effect of
profile version confirmed Hypothesis 1, showing that
smoking was perceived to be more harmful as the frequency
rose (MFrequently ¼ 4.63, SDFrequently ¼ 1.05; MOccasionally ¼
3.26, SDOccasionnaly ¼ 1.32; MNever ¼ 2.57, SDNever ¼ 1.03; all
ps < .001). However, simple effects analyses of the interaction
effect (see Figure 1) indicated that while the perceived overall
behavioral unhealthiness rose with the smoking frequency (all
ps < .001), there was no significant difference in perceived
riskiness between not smoking and smoking occasionally
(p ¼ .727). The frequent smoking profile, on the other hand,
had a significantly higher perceived riskiness compared to
smoking occasionally (p < .001) and not smoking (p < .001).
In addition, although the significant main effect of the
within-subjects factor harmfulness showed that the perceived

 unhealthiness ratings (M ¼ 3.61, SD ¼ 1.77) exceeded the
perceived riskiness (M ¼ 3.36, SD ¼ 1.47) for the smoking
profiles, the interaction effect pointed out that this was only the
case for occasional smoking (p ¼ .001) and frequent smoking
(p < .001). The nonsmoking profile was perceived to be more
risky than unhealthy (p < .001).
For the drinking profiles, the significant main effect of pro-
file version showed that drinking alcohol frequently (M ¼ 5.10,
SD ¼ 1.18) was perceived to be more harmful than drinking
occasionally (M ¼ 3.85, SD ¼ 1.07, p < .001) and not drinking
at all (M ¼ 3.56, SD ¼ 1.22, p < .001). However, a person
drinking occasionally was not perceived to behave more harm-
ful than a nondrinker (p ¼ .116). This was also found in the
follow-up analyses of the interaction effect, as the perceived
unhealthiness (p ¼ .107) and riskiness (p ¼ .256) did not differ
significantly between a nonuser and an occasional user. Yet,
it did rise significantly when drinking alcohol frequently
(psUnhealthiness � .001, psRiskiness � .030).
Furthermore, although the significant main effect of harm-
fulness showed that the alcohol profiles were considered more
risky (M ¼ 4.62, SD ¼ 1.58) than unhealthy (M ¼ 3.70, SD ¼
1.53), follow-up analyses of the interaction effect showed that
this was present only in the nondrinking profile and the occa-
sional drinking profile (ps < .001). No difference was found
between perceived riskiness and unhealthiness for the frequent
drinking profile (p ¼ .818).
The Perceived Sexual Strategy as a Function
of Tobacco and Alcohol Use
To study women’s perception of a man’s sexual strategy as a
function of his tobacco and alcohol use (Hypothesis 2), two 1-
way ANOVAs were conducted (one for smoking behavior and
one for drinking behavior), with the mean SOI score as dependent
variable and profile version (i.e., the three behavioral frequencies
never, occasionally, and frequently) as independent variable.
Results showed that the perceived sexual strategy was
affected by a man’s smoking behavior, F(2, 236) ¼ 10.91,
p < .001, Z2
p ¼ .085, and drinking behavior, F(2, 236) ¼ 29,
p < .001, Z2
p ¼ .197. Post hoc testing (see Figure 2) indicated
that both an occasional (p ¼ .002) and a frequent smoker
(p < .001) were seen as significantly more sexually unrestricted
than a nonsmoker. No significantdifferences werefound between
occasional smokers and frequent smokers (p ¼ .572). For alco-
hol use, on the other hand, post hoc tests revealed that there was
no significant difference in how an occasional drinker and a
nondrinker were seen (p ¼ 1.0). Only a frequent drinker was
perceived by women as more sexually unrestricted than a non-
drinker (p < .001) and an occasional drinker (p < .001).
Attractiveness as a Function of Smoking
and Drinking Behavior
Similar to Hypothesis 1, two mixed ANOVAs (one for smoking
behavior and one for drinking behavior) were conducted to
examine whether male short-term and long-term attractiveness
are affected differently by an individual’s smoking and drink-
ing behavior (Hypothesis 3). Short-term attractiveness and
long-term attractiveness served as independent variables in the
within-subjects factor ‘‘attractiveness,’’ whereas profile ver-
sion was used as between-subjects factor, varying between not
using, occasional usage, and frequent usage.
For both the smoking and the drinking profiles, a significant
main effect of the within-subjects factor attractiveness and the
between-subjects factor profile version was found. In addition,
results showed a significant interaction effect between short-
term and long-term attractiveness as a function of the smoking
and drinking frequency (see Table 2).
For smoking behavior, the significant main effect of profile
version indicated that a nonsmoker (M ¼ 4.57, SD ¼ 1.38,
p < .001) and an occasional smoker (M ¼ 4.49, SD ¼ 1.28,
p < .001) were considered more attractive than a frequent smo-
ker (M ¼ 3.64; SD ¼ 1.48). No differences were found between
a nonsmoker and occasional smoker (p ¼ .735). Follow-up
simple effects analyses of the interaction effect confirmed that
for short-term attractiveness, there was no significant differ-
ence between a nonsmoker and an occasional smoker (p ¼
.513). A frequent smoker was considered slightly less attractive
for short-term mating compared to a nonsmoker (p ¼ .046) and

 significantly less attractive than an occasional smoker (p ¼
.009). In a long-term mating context, there were also no sig-
nificant differences between not smoking and smoking occa-
sionally (p ¼ .238). However, contrary to short-term
attractiveness, frequent smoking significantly lowered a man’s
desirability as a potential partner compared to not smoking (p <
.001) or smoking cigarettes occasionally (p < .001).
In addition, although the significant main effect of the
within-subjects factor attractiveness showed that short-term
attractiveness (M ¼ 4.56, SD ¼ 1.50) scored higher than
long-term attractiveness (M ¼ 3.90, SD ¼ 1.71) in the smoking
profiles, pairwise comparisons of the interaction effect indi-
cated that only an occasional (p � .001) and frequent user
(p < .001) was considered significantly more attractive for
short-term mating compared to long-term mating. Nonsmokers
were rated equally attractive (p ¼ .20) in both mating contexts
(see Figure 3).
A slightly different picture emerged when looking at the
main effect of profile version for the alcohol profiles.
Drinking occasionally (M ¼ 4.71, SD ¼ 1.21) was consid-
ered more attractive than not drinking (M ¼ 3.78, SD ¼
1.29, p < .001) and drinking frequently (M ¼ 3.64, SD ¼
1.48, p < .001), with no significant differences between not
drinking and frequent drinking (p ¼ .517). However, the
interaction effect showed that for short-term relationships,
both occasional drinking (p < .001) and frequent drinking
(p ¼ .033) were considered as more attractive than being a
nondrinker. Additionally, an occasional drinker was per-
ceived as more desirable than a frequent drinker (p ¼
.012). For long-term mating contexts, occasional drinking
was also considered more attractive than not drinking
(p ¼ .002) or frequent drinking (p < .001). Yet, heavy
drinking significantly lowered a man’s long-term desirabil-
ity, as it was considered less attractive than both not drink-
ing (p ¼ .001) and occasional drinking (p < .001).
Moreover, here also, short-term attractiveness (M ¼ 4.38,
SD ¼ 1.59) received a higher score than long-term
attractiveness (M ¼ 3.71, SD ¼ 1.56), creating a significant
within-subjects factor main effect. However, similar to the
smoking profiles, simple effects analyses of the interaction
effect clarified that this was only the case for an occasional
(p = .001) and frequent drinker (p < .001). Nondrinkers were
considered equally attractive in a short-term or long-term
mating contexts (p ¼ .499).
The Influence of the Perceived Riskiness
and Unhealthiness on Females Impressions
To answer Hypothesis 4, mediation analyses were con-
ducted, with the SOI scores, short-term attractiveness, and
long-term attractiveness as separate outcome variables (Y).
The three dummy variables of the profile versions were
used as independent variables (X) and covariates. Perceived
overall unhealthiness and riskiness were the two separate
mediators (M).
Results (see Table 3) showed significant indirect effects of
the behavioral frequency of smoking on sexual unrestrictedness
scores, through unhealthiness perceptions. These findings indi-
cate that as the smoking frequency increases, the perceived
behavioral unhealthiness rises, leading to a more sexually
unrestricted impression. For drinking alcohol, there was no
mediation through perceived unhealthiness, yet perceived ris-
kiness did positively mediate the observed level of sexual
unrestrictedness for frequent drinking compared to not drinking
and occasional drinking.
For short-term attractiveness, no mediating effects were
found for both smoking and drinking behavior. Long-term
attractiveness, on the other hand, was mediated by women’s
overall behavioral perception but in a negative manner. Con-
sequently, a higher frequency led to a more harmful behavioral
perception, lowering a man’s long-term attractiveness. For
smoking, mediation occurred through unhealthiness percep-
tions. For alcohol, both the perceived unhealthiness and riski-
ness mediated the attractiveness scores, yet only for frequent
drinking behavior, compared to not drinking and occasional
drinking.
Discussion Study 1
The results of this study indicate that both smoking and drink-
ing could be considered a physically harmful behavior, which
functioned as an indicator of young men’s short-term mating
strategy. Also, smoking and (especially) drinking brought
short-term attractiveness benefits to men. In addition, women’s
assessment of men as a function of their smoking and drinking
behavior was partially mediated by the perceived overall beha-
vioral harmfulness. These results correspond with smoking and
drinking as a male short-term mating strategy. However, for a
mating strategy to work, young men’s behavior should corre-
spond with women’s perceptions. Therefore, the second study
focused on the sexual strategy of young male smokers
and drinkers.

Material and Method
Respondents
As this study was part of a more extended questionnaire asses-
sing a wide range of behaviors, 884 men and women of all ages
were contacted to fill in the survey. Of this group, 609 respon-
dents completed the survey. Given our focus on young adult
men, only data provided by men between the age of 17 and
30 years old were used in this study. Our final sample consisted
of 171 Flemish respondents (M ¼ 21.99, SD ¼ 2.51), of which
24.6% smoked cigarettes (n ¼ 42), while the majority of the
respondents indicated drinking alcohol (94.2%). Only a few
respondents never drank any alcohol (n ¼ 10).
Design and Measures
To investigate whether young men who engage in smoking and
drinking behavior are more unrestricted in their sexuality
(Hypothesis 5) and whether the behavioral frequency of users
correlates with their sexual unrestrictedness (Hypothesis 6), an
online survey was conducted in which people indicated their
smoking and drinking frequencies and their mating strategy.
Based on large-scale substance use questionnaires (Johnston
et al., 2014; Steketee, Jonkman, Berten, & Vettenburg, 2013),
both the frequency and the average consumption of youngsters’
smoking and drinking behavior were questioned. To

 differentiate between users and nonusers, respondents were
asked if they ever smoked cigarettes or drank alcohol. The
smoking and drinking frequency of youngsters was measured
by asking respondents to indicate the number of days in the past
month that they have smoked cigarettes or drunk alcohol.
Answers were given on a 7-point scale, with fixed categories
ranging from not one day to all days. The average consumption
was assessed by asking how much they smoked cigarettes/
drank alcohol on average per week. A scale with eight cate-
gories was provided, ranging from less than 1 cigarette/drink a
week to more than 20 cigarettes/alcoholic drinks a day.
To assess young men’s sexual mating strategies, their level
of sexual unrestrictedness was measured through the revised
SOI (SOI-R; Penke & Asendorpf, 2008). This questionnaire
consists of nine questions and statements, focusing on a per-
son’s attitude toward uncommitted sex (e.g., Sex without love is
OK.), their sociosexual desire (e.g., How often do you have
fantasies about having sex with someone with whom you do
not have a committed romantic relationship?), and past beha-
vioral experiences (e.g., With how many different partners have
you had sex within the past 12 months?). Also the Short-Term
Mating Orientation (STMO) scale and Long-Term Mating
Orientation (LTMO) scale were added, measuring short-term
and long-term mating tendencies through statements (Jackson
& Kirkpatrick, 2007). The STMO contains 10 statements (e.g.,
Sometimes I would rather have sex with someone I did not care
about.), while the LTMO consists of 8 questions (e.g., I hope to
have a romantic relationship that lasts the rest of my life.). All
scales had sufficient internal consistency (aSOI-R ¼ .81, aSTMO
¼ .87, aLTMO ¼ .76).
Statistical Analysis
Independent t-testing was used to verify if smokers are more
sexually unrestricted than nonsmokers (Hypothesis 5) via the
SOI-R. Given the violated assumption of normality, combined
with large differences in sample sizes, nonparametric Mann–
Whitney tests were used to compare users and nonusers on the
STMO and LTMO. These tests could not be conducted for
drinkers and nondrinkers, due to the small sample of 10 non-
drinkers. Therefore, as an additional verification, three new
variables were created through a median split (via rank cases)
of SOI-R, STMO, and LTMO, dividing all respondents into a
more sexually unrestricted and restricted group. Mann–Whit-
ney tests were conducted to verify if both groups differed in
their drinking frequency and average consumption. Finally, to
study the correlation between users’ level of sexual unrestrict-
edness and their cigarette and alcohol consumption, a one-
tailed Spearman correlation was opted for (Hypothesis 6).
Results
An independent t-test was conducted with SOI-R as dependent
variable and being a smoker/nonsmoker as independent vari-
able. Similarly, two Mann–Whitney tests were performed, with
STMO and LTMO as dependent variables. Confirming
Hypothesis 5, results via SOI-R showed that smokers (M ¼
4.56, SD ¼ 1.26) were significantly more unrestricted in their
sexuality than nonsmokers, M ¼ 3.87, SD ¼ 1.22; t(169) ¼
3.13, p ¼ .002, r ¼ .23. Also on the STMO scale, smokers (Mdn
¼ 4.80) scored significantly higher than nonsmokers (Mdn ¼
4.15; U ¼ 2,122, z ¼ �2.05, p ¼ .041, r ¼ �.16). No signif-
icant differences were found between users (Mdn ¼ 4.14) and
nonusers (Mdn ¼ 4.29) on the LTMO scale, yet a trend was
visible in which smokers were less long-term oriented (U ¼
2,151, z ¼ �1.95, p ¼ .052, r ¼ �.09).
For alcohol, Mann–Whitney tests were performed with the
median split variables as independent variables and drinking
frequency/average consumption as the dependent testing vari-
ables. Findings showed that the sexually short-term-oriented
group had a higher ranking on drinking frequency and average
drinking than the more sexually restricted group. This was
found when the median split was based on SOI-R (UFrequency
¼ 2,666.5, z ¼ �2.82, p ¼ .005, r ¼ �.22; UAverage ¼ 2,980,
z ¼ �2.16, p ¼ .031, r ¼ �.17), STMO (UFrequency ¼ 2,905.5,
z ¼ �1.91, p ¼ .056, r ¼ �.15; UAverage ¼ 2,921, z ¼ �2.23,
p ¼ .026, r ¼ �.17), and LTMO (UFrequency ¼ 2,688, z ¼
�2.53, p ¼ .011, r ¼ �.20; UAverage ¼ 2,655, z ¼ �2.98, p
¼ .003, r ¼ �.23). All sexually unrestricted groups had a
median score of five on both measures, while the more
restricted groups had a median of four. Accordingly, the unrest-
ricted group consumed up to 20 alcoholic drinks a week, while
the restricted group only drank between 4 and 10 drinks a week.
Furthermore, the more short-term-oriented group drank
between 10 and 19 days last month, compared to 6–9 days of
the more long-term-oriented group.
Furthermore, Spearman’s one-tailed correlations between
the usage of smokers and drinkers (frequency and average
consumption) and their level of sexual unrestrictedness were
conducted. Findings showed that there was no significant cor-
relation between the level of smoking behavior and their sexual
orientation (all ps � .116). However, the extent to which young
men drink alcohol did correlate positively with their level of
sexual unrestrictedness. Men who drank more frequently (rs ¼
.21, p ¼ .003) and had a higher average consumption (rs ¼ .19,
p ¼ .008) scored slightly higher on the SOI-R and vice versa.
The same positive correlation was found for the STMO scale
(rs Frequency ¼ .16, p ¼ .02; rs Average ¼ .19, p ¼ .007). For the
LTMO scale, a small negative correlation was present, indicat-
ing that a lower alcohol usage was correlated with a higher
LTMO (rs Frequency ¼ �.20, p ¼ .007; rs Average ¼ �.22, p ¼
.003). Since the same pattern is found as in Study 1, these
findings confirm Hypothesis 6.
Discussion Study 2
Results of Study 2 showed that young men who smoke were
more short-term oriented in their sexuality compared to
nonsmokers. Additionally, sexually unrestricted youngsters
appeared to drink more compared to the long-term-oriented
group. Furthermore, among users of tobacco, no link was
found between a man’s smoking frequency and his level of
8

 sexual unrestrictedness. However, a higher alcohol con-
sumption was positively correlated to a more unrestricted
sexuality. These findings correspond with women’s per-
ceptions, making no distinction between occasional and
frequent smokers, yet assessing heavy drinkers differently
from occasional drinkers.
General Discussion
Discussion
Despite the harmful physical effects of smoking and drinking,
many young men continue to use both substances. Therefore, in
this article, we explored the possibility that male youngsters
use these physical risky behaviors as a short-term mating strat-
egy. A first experiment studied whether smoking and drinking
affects the perceived overall behavioral harmfulness (Hypoth-
esis 1), whether women perceive smokers and drinkers to be
more sexually unrestricted compared to nonusers (Hypothesis
2), and whether both unhealthy consumption behaviors bring
short-term attractiveness benefits (Hypothesis 3). In addition, it
was verified whether women’s perceptions are mediated by the
perceived behavioral unhealthiness and riskiness (Hypothesis
4). Furthermore, a follow-up study investigated whether these
female perceptions correspond with men’s actual behavior and
mating strategy (Hypothesis 5 and 6).
Confirming Hypothesis 2, the first study showed that both
smokers and drinkers were perceived to be more short-term
oriented in their sexuality compared to people who do not use
tobacco or alcohol. However, a smoker was considered more
sexually unrestricted independent of his smoking frequency,
whereas only a heavy drinker was perceived to be more
short-term oriented compared to a nonuser.
In addition, corresponding with Hypothesis 3, smoking and
drinking brought short-term attractiveness benefits to its users.
While the attractiveness ratings of nonusers did not differ
depending on the mating context, both occasional and frequent
users were considered more appealing as a short-term dating
partner than a long-term partner. Moreover, as stated in
Hypothesis 3b, frequent drinking enhanced a young man’s
short-term desirability compared to not drinking, while harm-
ing his long-term attractiveness. For smoking, a similar trend
was visible, in which frequent smoking was considered only
slightly less attractive than not smoking in a short-term rela-
tionship but heavily lowered a man’s long-term desirability.
Also, as expected in Hypothesis 3a, occasional drinking
increased the attractiveness of men in both short-term and
long-term mating contexts. Occasional smoking, on the other
hand, was found equally attractive as not smoking in both
situations. These attractiveness findings correspond with the
studies of Farthing (2007), Kelly and Dunbar (2001), and Bas-
set and Moss (2004), showing that heavy physical risk taking is
mainly attractive in short-term mating contexts, while moder-
ate physical risk taking is also appealing for long-term mating.
It also corresponds with the recent study, showing that moder-
ate alcohol use enhances a man’s general (long term)
attractiveness, whereas heavy alcohol use has a rather negative
impact (Van Den Abbeele et al., 2015).
The second study confirmed these female perceptions and
Hypothesis 5, showing that male smokers were indeed more
short-term oriented in their sexuality compared to nonusers.
Furthermore, those youngsters who were more sexually unrest-
ricted appeared to have a higher drinking consumption. These
findings complement the findings of Jones and Figuerdo (2007)
as well as Hone, Carter, and Mccullough (2013) and Hone and
McCullough (2015), showing that higher mating efforts are
linked to smoking and drinking behavior. Moreover, when
looking at the mating strategy of actual smokers and drinkers,
there appeared to be no link between users’ amount of smoking
and their level of sexual unrestrictedness, whereas a positive
correlation was present for drinking alcohol. These findings
also correspond with women’s assessment of Study 1, in which
frequent drinkers were perceived differently from occasional
drinkers, yet no differences were found between occasional and
frequent smokers. Accordingly, also Hypothesis 6 was
confirmed.
In sum, the above findings show that both unhealthy con-
sumption behaviors could operate as a short-term mating strat-
egy, in which men use heavy smoking and drinking to signal a
short-term mating orientation and to obtain attractiveness ben-
efits in short-term mating contexts. However, this is especially
the case for drinking alcohol, more so than smoking cigarettes.
In addition, results are inconclusive as to how smoking cigar-
ettes and drinking alcohol actually functions as a short-term
mating strategy. On the one hand, findings confirmed that both
behaviors are actually considered physically harmful beha-
viors, as heavy smoking and heavy drinking affected the per-
ceived overall behavioral unhealthiness and riskiness of
youngsters. However, Hypothesis 4, verifying whether
women’s perceptions are actually mediated by the perceived
behavioral harmfulness was only partially confirmed. In line
with expectations, the positive mediation in the assessment of a
young man’s sexual strategy indicated that a higher perceived
behavioral harmfulness leads to a more sexually unrestricted
impression as the behavioral frequency rises. Furthermore, also
the negative mediating effect on a man’s long-term attractive-
ness corresponds with risk-taking literature, showing that a
man’s desirability lowers as the perceived harmfulness of the
behavior rises above a certain level (Bassett & Moss, 2004;
Farthing, 2007). Yet, mediation analyses were unable to con-
firm that the perceived harmfulness also had an impact on the
short-term attractiveness ratings. In addition, unhealthiness
mediated the impact of smoking behavior on women’s percep-
tion, while especially riskiness had indirect effects on how
drinking alcohol affected the perception of women.
These differences in results between the tobacco and alcohol
profiles could be related to the general idea that prevails among
young people in Belgium about smoking and drinking. Studies
already showed that having a favorable image of smokers facil-
itates smoking behavior (Gerrard, Gibbons, Stock, Lune, &
Cleveland, 2005; Gibbons & Gerrard, 1995; Spijkerman, van
den Eijnden, & Engels, 2005), while a positive image of
Vincke
9
 drinkers is related to a higher alcohol consumption (Gerrard
et al., 2002; Spijkerman, van den Eijnden, Vitale, & Engels,
2004). In Belgium, drinking alcohol is widely accepted among
youngsters, with 93% of the Flemish college and university
students drinking alcohol (Rosiers et al., 2014). Furthermore,
occasional drinking is not always perceived as harmful, due to
studies stating that moderate drinking can have positive effects
on a person’s health (Ellison, 2007; Gutjahr, Gmel, & Rehm,
2001; Rimm, Klatsky, Grobbee, & Stampfer, 1996). The dis-
course on smoking, on the other hand, is much more negative.
Youngsters are confronted more with warnings of the dangers
of smoking (e.g., each packet of cigarettes contains a clear
warning message in Belgium, yet no such messages are found
on alcoholic beverages). As a consequence, smoking is less
socially accepted, leading to ‘‘only’’ 30% of the young adult
students being a smoker (Rosiers et al., 2014). These cultural
attitudes could explain why there is a difference in the func-
tioning of smoking and drinking as a short-term mating strat-
egy. The fact that smoking is less socially accepted compared
to drinking corresponds with the fact that drinking alcohol
leads to clear attractiveness benefits, whereas smoking beha-
vior is limited to not harming men’s attractiveness. Moreover,
it matches with the fact that smokers are considered more
sexually short-term oriented, irrespective of their smoking fre-
quency, whereas only heavy drinking functions as an indicator
of a person’s sexual strategy. Finally, it also corresponds with
the mediating effect of perceived unhealthiness on smoking
behavior, while perceived riskiness had a higher impact on
alcohol-based impressions.
Limitations and Future Research
A potential confound in the first experimental study is the fact
that the presentation order of the cigarette and alcohol vignettes
was not randomized (all participants first rated a smoking pro-
file, followed by a drinking profile). Although each of the three
online links varied the behavioral frequency of the behavioral
profiles, ensuring a mix of never/occasional/frequent behavior,
some order effects might have influenced participants’ ratings
because of the fixed order. Also, the experimental study did not
take into account the participants’ smoking and drinking beha-
vior. Yet, for a future study, it would be interesting to verify if
users assess young men differently compared to nonusers.
Furthermore, asking about the perceived behavioral unhealthi-
ness and riskiness appeared insufficient to gain complete
insight in the functioning of smoking and drinking as a short-
term mating strategy, as no mediating effects were found to
explain the short-term attractiveness ratings. Perhaps asking
how unhealthy and risky participants considered the actual
smoking and drinking behavior to be—instead of the overall
behavior—would show significant positive mediating effects.
In addition, to increase our understanding of why smoking and
drinking operates as a short-term mating strategy, follow-up
studies could focus on identifying which characteristics
tobacco and alcohol use signal to potential partners, in addition
to the attractiveness benefits. When studying women’s
perceptions of men, we would also suggest new studies to take
into account the amount of cigarettes and alcohol that is con-
sumed on one occasion. As short-term mating intentions are
often based on interactions in one occasion, women are not
always aware of men’s general smoking and drinking behavior.
However, the amount of cigarettes and alcoholic beverages that
are consumed on one occasion can often be witnessed. More-
over, drinking or smoking occasionally can mean also that a
person occasionally engages in heavy episodic drinking/smok-
ing instead of moderate usage. Furthermore, in our second
study, we only had a limited number of respondents who did
not drink alcohol. As a consequence, additional tests were per-
formed using a median split between the more short-term and
long-term-oriented respondents. However, future studies are
necessary to verify whether the differences in sexual unrest-
rictedness are present for both smokers and drinkers.
Conclusion and Implications
In this article, we explored the possibility that young male smok-
ing and drinking is used as a short-term mating strategy. Find-
ings showed that tobacco and alcohol use are considered
physically harmful behaviors that operate as an indicator for
young men’s short-term sexual orientation. Furthermore, despite
all efforts to sensitize youngsters for the dangers of smoking and
drinking, male tobacco and (especially) alcohol use still bring
attractiveness benefits in short-term mating situations. Given the
harmfulness and high frequency of both consumption behaviors
in young adulthood, these findings are of interest to both social
marketing professionals and institutions aimed at limiting youth
smoking and drinking behavior. Not only do these findings show
that emphasizing the physical harmful effects of cigarettes and
alcohol in order to prevent the unhealthy behaviors might not be
effective. It may even turn out to be contra productive.
