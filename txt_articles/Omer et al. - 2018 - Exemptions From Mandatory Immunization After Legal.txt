BACKGROUND: The success of health care provider counseling–based interventions to 
address vaccine hesitancy is not clear. In 2011, Washington State implemented Senate 
Bill 5005 (SB5005), requiring counseling and a signed form from a licensed health care 
provider to obtain an exemption. Evaluating the impact of a counseling intervention can 
provide important insight into population-level interventions that focus on interpersonal 
communication by a health care provider.
METHODS: We used segmented regression and interaction and aggregation indices to assess 
the impact of SB5005 on immunization coverage and exemption rates in Washington State 
from school years 1997–1998 through 2013–2014.
RESULTS: After SB5005 was implemented, there was a significant relative decrease of 
40.2% (95% confidence interval: −43.6% to −36.6%) in exemption rates. This translates 
to a significant absolute reduction of 2.9 percentage points (95% confidence interval: 
−4.2% to −1.7%) in exemption rates. There were increases in vaccine coverage for all 
vaccines required for school entrance, with the exception of the hepatitis B vaccine. The 
probability that kindergarteners without exemptions would encounter kindergarteners 
with exemptions (interaction index) decreased, and the probability that kindergarteners 
with exemptions would encounter other such kindergarteners (aggregation index) also 
decreased after SB5005. Moreover, SB5005 was associated with a decline in geographic 
clustering of vaccine exemptors.
CONCLUSIONS: States in the United States and jurisdictions in other countries should consider 
adding parental counseling by health care provider as a requirement for obtaining 
exemptions to vaccination requirements.

What’s KnoWn on this subject: Exemption rates for 
mandated immunizations are associated with ease of 
the administrative procedures to obtain exemptions. 
Several states, in recent years, have implemented the 
addition of health care provider counseling/signature as 
a requirement to obtain a nonmedical exemption.
What this study adds: The success of counseling-
based interventions to address vaccine hesitancy is not 
clear. Evaluating the impact of a counseling intervention 
can provide important insight into population-
level interventions that focus on interpersonal 
communication by an authority figure.

 Immunization mandates have 
helped the United States achieve 
and maintain high immunization 
coverage and low disease rates.1 
However, local clustering of vaccine 
exemptors has been associated with 
outbreaks of measles and pertussis.2, 
 
3  
In fact, elimination of endemic 
transmission of measles in the 
United States might be threatened 
by the accumulation of children with 
vaccine exemptions.4
State laws in the United States 
mandate that the parent of every 
child entering kindergarten either 
provide proof of immunization or 
file for an exemption. All 50 states 
and Washington, DC, allow for 
medical exemptions from mandated 
vaccinations. Eighteen states allow 
religious, personal belief, and 
medical exemptions; 29 states and 
Washington, DC, permit religious and 
medical exemptions but not personal 
belief exemptions; and 3 states 
only allow medical exemptions.5 
Immunization coverage and rates of 
nonmedical (ie, religious or personal 
belief) exemptions vary by state. 
After accounting for demographic 
differences, state-level and school-
level nonmedical exemptions rates 
are associated with ease of the 
administrative procedures to obtain 
exemptions.6, 
 
7
Given the association between 
procedures for obtaining exemptions 
and higher rates of nonmedical 
exemptions, several states 
have attempted to modify their 
administrative requirements for 
obtaining nonmedical exemptions. 
One strategy implemented by several 
states in recent years is the addition 
of health care provider counseling 
and/or signature as a requirement to 
obtain a nonmedical exemption. The 
ostensible rationale for adding such a 
requirement is to ensure that parents 
have sufficient information about 
the risks of nonvaccination and to 
correct misperceptions about vaccine 
safety. However, the success of such 
counseling-based interventions is not 
clear. There is evidence of a so-called 
“backfire” effect when attempting to 
correct misinformation.8 This backfire 
effect has been previously reported in 
the context of vaccines, 
9, 
 
10 although 
not consistently. Moreover, making 
procedures for granting nonmedical 
exemptions more difficult may have 
an “offset” effect, causing medical 
exemption rates to increase.11
Evaluating the impact of mass 
implementation of a counseling 
intervention can therefore provide 
important insight into population-
level interventions that focus on 
interpersonal communication by an 
authority figure, in this case a health 
care provider. Moreover, it is important 
to identify the impact of any change  
in state-level rates of exemptions on 
local clustering of vaccine refusers, 
which can dramatically affect the  
risk of an outbreak.
Washington was the first state in recent 
years to make a significant change in 
its vaccine exemption requirements. 
The Senate Bill 5005 (SB5005) was 
implemented on July 22, 2011. The law 
requires parents seeking an exemption 
to submit a Certificate of Exemption 
(COE) signed by a Washington-licensed 
health care provider documenting 
that the parent(s) have discussed “the 
benefits and risks of immunizations” 
with the provider (Supplemental Fig 
4 and 5). In this study, we evaluated 
the impact of adding a health care 
provider counseling and/or signature 
requirement to the Washington 
exemption process on subsequent 
vaccination and vaccine exemption 
rates, and on the local clustering of 
vaccine exemptions. This is the first 
study in which the impact of adding 
parental counseling to requirements 
for obtaining vaccine exemptions has 
been evaluated.
Methods
data
Kindergartener immunization 
coverage and exemption data were 
obtained from the Washington 
State Department of Health. The 
data included school- and state-
level coverage (ie, the percentage of 
children who are vaccinated for each 
school) information for all mandated 
immunizations, exemptions (medical, 
personal, religious and/or religious 
membership), conditional entrants 
(students who were allowed to 
attend school on condition of 
parents to subsequently provide 
evidence of vaccination), and 
noncompliant entrants (entrants 
that did not provide subsequent 
evidence of vaccination or a signed 
exemption form) for each school 
year of interest. The data also 
included school enrollment data 
and disease-specific coverage for 
vaccines required by Washington 
(diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis, polio, 
pertussis, measles-mumps-rubella, 
hepatitis B, and varicella vaccines) 
for each school year of interest. The 
study period included school years 
1997–1998 through 2013–2014. 
School addresses were obtained 
from the Washington State Office of 
Superintendent of Public Instruction 
and were geocoded by using the 
United States Census Bureau Census 
Geocoder.12
Longitudinal analysis
We fit 2 types of multivariable 
models to evaluate the impact of 
law on each coverage outcome of 
interest. Since Washington State 
did not report exemption type (ie, 
medical, nonmedical, and permanent 
medical exemption rates) before the 
2012–2013 school year and changes 
in procedures can potentially have an 
“offset” effect on medical exemption 
rates, the dependent variable for 
both types of models was overall 
exemption rates. Using state-level 
data, we fit linear models corrected 
for first order autocorrelation 
between years to compute absolute 
changes in exemption/vaccination 
rates. For each linear model, we 
checked for autocorrelation before 
fitting the full model. We used 
negative binomial regression instead

 of Poisson regression because our 
outcomes of interest are statistically 
considered to be rare and there 
is overdispersion in the data as 
evaluated by Pearson and deviance 
statistics to test for overdispersion. 
By using school-level data, we fit a 
negative binomial model using robust 
SEs computed with generalized 
estimating equations considering 
school as the clustering variable, 
accounting for interaction between 
year and policy era (before/
after SB5005), with first-order 
autoregressive covariance structures 
for residuals and random effects 
parameters to compute incidence 
rate ratios and relative change in 
rate. The number of students enrolled 
in each school was included as an 
offset term in the model to account 
for differences in rates by school size. 
Because schools are where children 
experience the majority of exposures 
to unvaccinated children, we chose 
to model school-level effects rather 
than effects at any additional levels 
of aggregation. We dropped models 
that provided a poor fit compared 
with observed values or that failed 
for mathematical issues such as 
nonconvergence, indefinite Hessian 
matrix, and infinite likelihood. For 
linear models, we used maximum 
likelihood, and for negative binomial 
models, we used generalized 
estimating equations to obtain 
parameter estimates.
Institutional review board approval 
for this study was obtained through 
Emory University. All analyses were 
performed by using SAS 9.4 (SAS 
Institute, Inc, Cary, NC).
spatial analysis
With school data for each school 
year from 1997–1998 through 
2013–2014, we used kriging tools in 
ArcMap 10.2.2 (Esri, Redlands, CA) 
to create predicted local exemption 
rates for the whole state.13 We 
dropped schools in the 99th 
percentile for exemption rates before 
generating the predicted surface 
because kriging is influenced by 
extreme values.14 Each data year was 
standardized by using quantiles of 
the average predicted exemption rate 
for all years.
interaction and aggregations 
indices
We used 2 measures of exposure, 
interaction and aggregation indices, 
to estimate the likelihood that 
kindergarteners would be exposed 
to other children with exemptions at 
their school. These measures have 
been used to estimate the exposure 
of a racial minority population to 
a majority population15 but have 
also been used in a similar analysis 
assessing exemptions in California.16 
To calculate the interaction and 
aggregation index, we used methods 
as described by Buttenheim et al.16
The interaction index is a measure of 
the probability that kindergarteners 
without exemptions will have 
contact with kindergarteners with 
exemptions at school. The index 
is calculated as the sum, across 
all schools, of the school-specific 
exemption rate weighted by the 
proportion of all nonexempted 
kindergarteners who attend that 
school:
 
Interaction Index =  
∑ 
i=1 
 
N  
[ 
( 
 
ai 
_ 
A  
) 
( 
 
xi 
_ 
ki 
 
) 
] 
 ∗ 100 
wherein ai is the number of 
adherent kindergartners in school 
i, A is the total number of adherent 
kindergartners for all schools, 
xi is the number of exempted 
kindergartners in school i, ki is the 
total kindergarten enrollment in 
school i, and N is the number of 
schools in the area for which the 
index is being calculated (ie, the state 
or county).16
The aggregation index is a measure 
of the probability that kindergartners 
with exemptions will have contact 
with other exempted kindergartners 
at school. The index is calculated 
as the sum, across all schools, of 
the school-specific exemption 
rate weighted by proportion of all 
exempted kindergarteners who 
attend that school:

i, X is the total number of exempted 
kindergartners, ki is the total 
kindergarten enrollment in school 
i, and N is the number of schools in 
the area for which the index is being 
calculated.16
ResuLts
After SB5005 was implemented, 
there was a significant relative 
decrease of 40.2% (95% confidence 
interval [CI]: −43.6% to −36.6%) 
in exemption rates in Washington. 
Moreover, there was a significant 
absolute reduction of 2.9 percentage 
points (95% CI: −4.2% to −1.7%) 
in the rates of immunization 
exemptions at the state level (Table 1, 
 
Fig 1, Supplemental Table 2). Vaccine 
coverage for all vaccines required for 
school entrance either increased or 
remained the same (Table 1). There 
was also an increase in conditional 
entrants after the implementation of 
SB5005; however, this increase was 
small and insignificant (0.6%, 95% 
CI −0.9% to 2.1%) (Fig 1C, Table 1, 
Supplemental Table 2). Additionally, 
there was an absolute decrease in 
entrants who were out of compliance 
(Fig 1D, Supplemental Table 2).
The probability that kindergarteners 
without exemptions would 
encounter kindergarteners with 
exemptions (interaction index) 
generally decreased after SB5005 
became effective. Similarly, the 
probability that kindergarteners with 
exemptions would encounter other 
such kindergarteners (aggregation 
index) also decreased after SB5005 
(Fig 2). Based on spatial analysis, 
high exemption rates appeared to 
be clustered in the northern areas

 of the state until 2010. In most 
cases, predicted exemption rates 
were found to decrease, specifically 
in geographic areas with high 
exemption rates, after SB5005 
became effective (Fig 3).
discussion
The implementation of SB5005, 
which added a health care provider 
counseling and/or signature 
requirement for parents requesting 
immunization exemptions for 
their children, was associated with 
decreases in exemption rates. This 
highlights the importance of more 
stringent polices for obtaining 
immunization exemptions. There did 
appear to be variation in the trend 
line between 2008 and 2009 in the 
rates for any exemptions and overall 
vaccination coverage. This variation 
can potentially be explained by the 
updates made to the Certificate of 
Immunization Status (CIS) and COE, 
which were implemented in the 
2009–2010 school year. Before 2008, 
the CIS and COE were on 1 form, front 
and back (Supplemental Fig 6 and 
7). In 2008, the COE was separated 
from the CIS, becoming a stand-
alone form (Supplemental Fig 4 and 
5). This additional form may have 
increased the difficulty of obtaining 
an exemption, therefore decreasing 
exemption rates. Another possible 
explanation for this variation is 
the change in varicella vaccination 
requirement that took place in 2008; 
all children attending kindergarten 
after July 1, 2008, are required to 
have 2 doses of varicella vaccine 
or provider verification of varicella 
disease. This new requirement may 
have caused an increase in overall 
immunization coverage after 2008. 
However, despite this variation, 
the trend line was generally stable. 
Furthermore, the data indicate that 
exemption rates are approaching a 
steady state.
Although there was an increase in 
conditional entrants (ie, students 
who were allowed to attend school 
on condition of parents subsequently 
providing evidence of vaccination), 
there was, reassuringly, a decrease in 
entrants who were out of compliance. 
However, the proportion of enrolled 
students that are conditional entrants 
and out of compliance was ∼10% 
after the implementation of the law. 
This indicates that efforts should also 
focus on enforcing compliance of 
these conditional entrants. Moreover, 
there was a sustained decrease in the 
interaction index, indicating that the 
risk of a vaccinated child interacting 
with a child with an exemption 
declined after the implementation of 
SB5005.
Although this is the first study in 
which the impact of adding a health 
care provider counseling and/or 
signature requirement has been 
evaluated, previous data reveal the 
utility of state and school policies that 
increase the overall administrative 
requirements to obtain exemptions. 
In an analysis of state-level 
exemptions data from 2005 through 
2011, states that had easy procedures 
for granting nonmedical exemptions 
had almost double the rates of 
nonmedical exemptions compared 
with states with difficult procedures 
for exemptions.7 A similar association 
was observed in a study evaluating 
the association between ease of 
obtaining exemptions and change in 
exemption rates from 1991 through 
2004.17 One concern associated with 
interventions that increase overall 
administrative difficulty for obtaining 
nonmedical exemptions is a potential 
increase in vaccine-hesitant parents 
seeking medical exemptions from 
sympathetic providers. However, 
in a study of medical exemptions 
and procedures for granting such 
exemptions, states with difficult 
procedures for granting nonmedical 
exemptions had only slightly 
higher rates of medical exemptions, 
 
11 indicating a minimal offset in 
exemption rates.
Given the concerns of a potential 
backfire effect for information-based

 intervention, it is reassuring to see that 
parental counseling was not associated 
with a net increase in exemption rates 
or net decrease in vaccination rates. 
This could be caused by many factors. 
First, the so-called backfire effect 
has not been consistently replicated. 
Second, the clinical interaction 
between a health care provider and 
a parent revolves around not only 
correcting misinformation but also, 
among other things, increasing disease 
salience, which may be more relevant 
to parents.8 Moreover, physicians are 
the most trusted source of vaccine 
information.18 Third, the effect of this 
policy change might be caused by an 
increase in administrative difficulty 
of obtaining an exemption, rather 
than by persuasive interpersonal 
communications.

 Several states have attempted to 
eliminate nonmedical exemptions 
altogether, and in 2015, California 
state legislators were successful in 
doing so. California is only  
the third state to implement  
a policy that does not allow any 
nonmedical exemptions and  
is the first state in over  
3 decades to eliminate a  
nonmedical exemption provision. 
Given that the new California 
law only went into effect in the 
2016–2017 school year, it will be a 
few years before its impact can be 
appropriately evaluated; currently 
only 1 year’s postimplementation 
data are available. Meanwhile, 
evidence that adding a parental 
counseling requirement may 
be effective in reducing vaccine 
exemptions and is likely to inform 
vaccine policy in many states. 
Notably, legislative efforts to 
restrict exemptions have been 
more successful than attempts to 
eliminate them entirely.6
There are several limitations of 
our study. First, we did not have 
a control population; therefore, 
unrelated secular changes may 
have impacted our findings. 
However, given the demographic 
heterogeneity among states, using 
another state as a comparison 
may have introduced additional 
problems. Moreover, our findings 
should be generalized to other states 
and jurisdictions with some caution. 
The impact of adding parental 
counseling may depend on state-
specific variation in immunization 
laws, health infrastructure, and 
other context-specific factors. 
Therefore, this type of analysis will 
have to be repeated for other states 
with recent changes in vaccine laws 
as their postchange data become 
available.
concLusions
Our findings highlight the 
importance of evidence-informed 
legislation to reduce the risk of 
vaccine preventable diseases. 
States in the United States and 
jurisdictions in other countries 
should consider adding parental 
counseling as a requirement for 
obtaining exemptions to vaccination 
requirements.
