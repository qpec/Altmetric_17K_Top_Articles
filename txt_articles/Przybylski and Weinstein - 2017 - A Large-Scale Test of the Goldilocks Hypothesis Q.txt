The proliferation of digital devices has fundamentally 
changed how humans work, play, and socialize. Rapid 
technological developments in high-speed Internet, flat-
panel displays, and mobile computing power have led to 
devices that now define and shape modern childhood 
(Lenhart, Smith, Anderson, Duggan, & Perrin, 2015). For 
example, the amount of time adolescents spend online 
has more than doubled from an average of 8 hr per week 
in 2005 to 18.9 hr per week today (Ofcom, 2015), and the 
time spent with these technologies, especially during 
childhood and adolescence, has sparked concerns that 
their use might be negatively associated with mental and 
social well-being (for a review of this controversy, see 
Bell, Bishop, & Przybylski, 2015). Indeed, the American 
Academy of Pediatrics has recommended that restrictions 
be placed on children’s screen time (Council on Commu-
nications and Media, 2013), indicating that there are incre-
mental costs of screen time for children’s wellness, though 
the value of this limitation-focused approach has been 
questioned by developmental (Linebarger & Vaala, 2010) 
and clinical (Ferguson & Donnellan, 2014) researchers.
The goal of the present research was to evaluate dif-
ferent ways of understanding how screen time is linked 
to mental well-being, and to empirically quantify and 
define moderate engagement in digital activities. To date, 
one view of the effects of screen time predominates the 
literature: the displacement hypothesis (Neuman, 1988), 
which posits that the harms of technology are directly 
proportional to exposure. Effects are claimed to be nega-
tive because digital activities supplant alternate activities 
such as socializing with peers and family, reading books, 
or exercising. We tested an alternate theory, implicit in

Abstract
Although the time adolescents spend with digital technologies has sparked widespread concerns that their use might 
be negatively associated with mental well-being, these potential deleterious influences have not been rigorously 
studied. Using a preregistered plan for analyzing data collected from a representative sample of English adolescents 
(n = 120,115), we obtained evidence that the links between digital-screen time and mental well-being are described 
by quadratic functions. Further, our results showed that these links vary as a function of when digital technologies are 
used (i.e., weekday vs. weekend), suggesting that a full understanding of the impact of these recreational activities 
will require examining their functionality among other daily pursuits. Overall, the evidence indicated that moderate 
use of digital technology is not intrinsically harmful and may be advantageous in a connected world. The findings 
inform recommendations for limiting adolescents’ technology use and provide a template for conducting rigorous 
investigations into the relations between digital technology and children’s and adolescents’ health.

the literature but not explicitly studied, which we label 
the digital Goldilocks hypothesis. According to this 
hypothesis, tech use at moderate levels is not intrinsically 
harmful (Etchells, Gage, Rutherford, & Munafò, 2016; 
Parkes, Sweeting, Wight, & Henderson, 2013; Przybylski, 
2014) and may be advantageous in a connected world, 
whereas “overuse” may indeed displace alternate activi-
ties, for example, interfering with school or with extra-
curricular or other social activities (Valkenburg & Peter, 
2009). In the fairy tale, Goldilocks identifies moderation 
(in porridge and beds) as “just right.” Similarly, it might 
be that “too little” tech use deprives young people of 
important social information and peer pursuits, whereas 
“too much” may displace other meaningful activities. Our 
Goldilocks hypothesis postulates that there are empiri-
cally derivable balance points, moderate levels, that are 
“just right” for optimally connected young people.
To the extent that digital activities either enrich adoles-
cents or displace more rewarding activities, they should 
have, respectively, positive or negative effects on adoles-
cents’ mental well-being, which we define as flourishing 
characterized by positive emotions, effective functioning 
(including psychosocial functioning), and a sense of life 
satisfaction (Ryan & Deci, 2000; Tennant et al., 2007). 
According to the displacement hypothesis, the relation-
ship between screen time and well-being is negative and 
monotonic, as each “dose” of screen time takes the place 
of alternative pursuits that might be more satisfying. 
However, recent research suggests that this account may 
not accurately describe the role of digital technology in 
everyday life. Indeed, adolescents must develop their 
identity and build life and social skills, and doing so fos-
ters well-being (Luyckx, Soenens, Goossens, Beckx, & 
Wouters, 2008; Yarcheski, Mahon, & Yarcheski, 2001). It 
may be that technology provides opportunities to pursue 
these developmental challenges in a satisfying way. For 
example, although many people may think of gaming as 
a socially isolating activity, research indicates that online 
gaming handles are one of the first pieces of information 
that 38% of adolescent boys share when they meet some-
one with whom they would like to be friends (Lenhart 
et al., 2015). Similarly, 83% of adolescents say that social 
media makes them feel more connected to their friends, 
and 68% say that they have received social support 
 
using digital technologies in tough or challenging times 
(Lenhart et al., 2015). Thus, there is good reason to think 
that digital engagement, in moderation, may not be dis-
ruptive, and that it may even support development.
Much of what is known regarding the possible influ-
ence of screen time comes from the study of sedentary 
and nonsedentary activity in young people. Guided by the 
displacement hypothesis, existing research has compared 
activities by looking at physical health correlates such as 
body mass index (Anderson, Economos, & Must, 2008; 
Boone, Gordon-Larsen, Adair, & Popkin, 2007), amount of 
rigorous exercise (Anderson et al., 2008; Sisson, Broyles, 
 
Baker, & Katzmarzyk, 2010), or energy expenditure 
 
(Lanningham-Foster et al., 2006). Definitions and opera-
tionalizations of what constitutes engagement in an activ-
ity vary, but most studies have tested how doses of 
activities of interest relate to physical and psychological 
outcomes. Nearly all have found statistically significant 
differences between sedentary and nonsedentary activi-
ties, identifying the former as deleterious, but patterns 
evident in the literature hint at a richer dynamic than the 
displacement account suggests.
First, these studies have documented only weak links 
between screen time and health, which suggests the possi-
bility of a stronger alternative theoretical account (Anderson 
et al., 2008; Boone et al., 2007; Iannotti, Kogan, Janssen, & 
Boyce, 2009). Second, research indicates that any detrimen-
tal effects of screen time on physical health depend on the 
type of digital activity, and that some screen activities actu-
ally promote physical activity (Lanningham-Foster et al., 
2006). Third, studies examining physical outcomes (Anderson 
 
et al., 2008; Boone et al., 2007; Sisson et al., 2010), and 
preliminary work examining psychological ones, have 
shown inconsistent linear relations (Kremer et al., 2014), or 
used post hoc bucketed predictors, and estimated effects for 
comparable types of digital technologies vary widely (Cao 
et al., 2011; Hamer, Stamatakis, & Mishra, 2009, 2010). A 
handful of recent large-scale studies indicate that low to 
moderate levels (i.e., < 2–3 hr per day) of playing video 
games (Etchells et al., 2016; Przybylski, 2014) and watching 
films (Parkes et al., 2013) have little or no relation to emo-
tional and social functioning, and that such activities may 
have negative effects for young people only at higher levels 
of engagement.
The research reported here was the first to systemati-
cally test for curvilinear relations between well-being and 
screen time measured continuously, separately for differ-
ent digital activities and days of the week. As predicted 
by the Goldilocks hypothesis, we expected to find curvi-
linear associations, with no costs to mental well-being for 
moderate levels of screen time and some detriments at 
high levels. For the first time in this area of research, we 
defined low and high levels of screen time empirically by 
testing for local maxima, the inflection points, operation-
alized as the points at which the slopes relating screen 
time to well-being approached zero before reversing in 
sign. Thus, we identified the point at which each type of 
media use shifted from having a null or positive relation 
with mental well-being to having a negative relation indi-
cating a detrimental effect.

Method
Participants
Participants were identified using the United Kingdom’s 
Department for Education National Pupil Database. Field-
work covered a total of 150 local authorities across Eng-
land, with the aim of making sufficient observations of 
English 15-year-olds to attain a ±0.3% margin of error at a 
95% confidence interval. A notification letter sent to par-
ents or caregivers of potential participants gave them the 
opportunity to opt their child out of the survey, and writ-
ten consent was collected directly from all participants. 
The original sampling frame for the study included 298,080 
15-year-olds. Of these, 2,835 were lost because the surveys 
were undeliverable or adolescent participants opted out of 
the study prior to data collection. A total of 120,115 partici-
pants provided usable data by responding to paper (n = 
100,850) or online (n = 19,265) questionnaires.
Ethical review
A comprehensive ethical review regarding the data col-
lection was conducted by the United Kingdom’s National 
Children’s Bureau, and an ethics review regarding the 
data analysis was conducted by the research ethics com-
mittee at the University of Oxford.
Measures
Criterion variable: mental well-being. The Warwick- 
Edinburgh Mental Well-Being Scale (Tennant et al., 
2007), a 14-item self-report instrument validated for use 
in general population samples of individuals ages 13 
years and above, was used to measure the happiness, life 
satisfaction, psychological functioning, and social func-
tioning of participants. As found in past research using 
this instrument with young people (Stewart-Brown et al., 
2009), the scale showed high internal consistency (Cron-
bach’s α = .90). Scores ranged from 14 to 70 (M = 47.52, 
SD = 9.55).
Explanatory variables: digital-screen time. Partici-
pants were asked four questions regarding their engage-
ment in different kinds of digital activities during their 
free time. Specifically, they were asked about watching 
films and other media (e.g., TV programs), playing games 
(e.g., on computers and consoles), using computers (e.g., 
Internet, e-mail), and using smartphones (e.g., social net-
working, chatting online).
Control and confounding variables. Past research 
has linked both the explanatory and the criterion 
variables to gender and ethnicity (Clarke et al., 2011) and 
economic factors (Eynon & Helsper, 2015; Tennant et al., 
2007). These were treated as control variables for the 
purposes of statistical modeling. Self-reported gender on 
the survey was coded 1 for male and 0 otherwise. Aggre-
gate information derived from postal-code data was used 
to identify if participants lived in a relatively deprived 
local-authority district (Department for Communities and 
Local Government, 2015). Residence in an area in the 
upper two quintiles of the multiple deprivation index 
(i.e., an area with high scores on unemployment, crime, 
poor public services, and barriers to housing) was coded 
1; residence in an area in the lower two quintiles was 
coded 0. Minority status was assessed on the survey by 
asking participants about their ethnic background; they 
were instructed that ethnic identification can be based on 
many things, such as skin color, culture, language, or 
family ancestry. Following the approach taken by the 
United Kingdom Office for National Statistics (2012), we 
assigned 0 as the code for participants who self-identified 
as White and 1 as the code for those who reported being 
of other ethnicities.
Results
Analytic strategy
The preregistered analytic strategy is available at the 
Open Science Framework (osf.io/b4cgq). There were 
three deviations from that plan. First, two control vari-
ables we intended to include in the statistical models 
were not available: (a) whether participants’ parents were 
married and (b) whether participants were born in the 
United Kingdom. Second, it was clear from the plotted 
data (see Fig. 1) that there were no negative monotonic 
relationships between digital-screen time and mental 
well-being. A negative linear trend could technically be 
fit onto the data, but its suitability would be poor, as out-
come values increased across levels of the explanatory 
variables before decreasing. Therefore, our regression 
models considered trends with both linear and quadratic 
components. Finally, when we examined the distribu-
tions of total digital-screen time, the sums of the esti-
mates, it was clear that many participants had reported 
simultaneous screen use; approximately 20% of the sam-
ple reported a sum of more than 12 hr of engagement on 
weekdays, and 35% of the sample reported a total of 
more than 12 hr on weekend days. Given that these val-
ues were consistent with earlier research demonstrating 
that digital media are often used in parallel (Eynon & 
Helsper, 2015), it did not make theoretical or practical 
sense to follow the original plan to test these summed 
screen-time estimates.

Exploratory analyses
Engagement in digital activities was quite popular in our 
sample, as more than 99.9% of the participants reported 
allocating some time to at least one form of digital tech-
nology on a daily basis. Exploratory t tests comparing 
boys’ and girls’ responses indicated that the girls reported 
spending more time using smartphones, using comput-
ers, and watching videos, and the boys devoted more 
time to playing computer and console games (all ps < 
.001; Fig. 2). Across the four types of activities, screen 
time was between 25 min and 1 hr 5 min longer on

t tests showed that these differences were significant, all 
ps < .001. Repeated measures analyses of variance using 
within-subjects contrasts indicated that more time was 
spent using smartphones than engaging in the other 
three categories of screen-based activities, all ps < .001 
(Fig. 2). Note that boys devoted far more time to gaming 
on both weekdays and weekend days compared with 
girls.
Confirmatory analyses
A series of regression models tested how weekday and 
weekend engagement with digital screens was related to 
mental well-being, assessed with the Warwick-Edinburgh 
Mental Well-Being Scale. These analyses, which included 
both linear and nonlinear components, indicated that the 
quadratic trends evident in Figure 1 were statistically sig-
nificant for all four types of digital activities. Concave-
down quadratic functions were evident for watching 
films and TV on weekdays and weekends, for playing 
games on weekdays and weekends, for using a computer 
on weekdays and weekends, and for using a smartphone 
on weekdays (see Table 1 for the results of the regression 
models). Consistency across both weekdays and week-
ends and across four different types of digital activities 
provided support for the Goldilocks hypothesis. In sum, 
a direct comparison of the relation between screen time 
and mental well-being at low versus high levels of screen 
time—a comparison that, to our knowledge, has not 
been made in previous work—revealed that this relation 
does in fact vary with the level of screen time. When we 
treated gender, economic factors and technology access, 
and ethnicity as control variables in the models, half of 
the observed effect sizes were noticeably reduced, but 
the direction and significance of the effects were 
unchanged (Table 2).
Empirically derived inflection points. To further 
define the quadratic patterns present in the data, we cal-
culated local extrema for the models statistically control-
ling for variance linked to potential confounds. If indeed 
the relations between mental well-being and digital-
screen time are nonlinear, systematically quantifying the 
point at which engagement shifts from benign to harmful 
is important (Nelson & Simonsohn, 2014). Results from 
these analyses revealed clear inflection points relating 
screen time to well-being (Table 3, Fig. 3). Local extrema 
were at 1 hr 40 min for weekday video-game play and 1 
hr 57 min for weekday smartphone use. In contrast, 
watching videos and using computers for recreational 
purposes appeared to be less potentially disruptive at 
these levels, as the local extrema for these activities on 
weekdays were 3 hr 41 min and 4 hr 17 min, respectively. 
Indeed, some digital activities might be better suited than 
others to weekdays. For example, it is relatively easy to 
switch between different tasks using a computer, whereas 
an activity such as playing a video game requires more 
dedicated attention. For weekends, the derived inflection

points ranged from 3 hr 35 min for playing video games 
to 4 hr 50 m for watching videos. Thus, the pivot points 
between moderate and potentially harmful screen time 
were notably higher and less variable for weekend days 
than for weekdays, which suggests that the nature and 
amount of engagement matter for understanding the rela-
tions between digital-screen time and mental well-being.
Below these thresholds, the relations between screen 
time and mental well-being were either positive (p ≤ 
.001) or flat (ps > .183), except for a negative link in the 
case of weekend smartphone use (Fig. 3, Table 3). Above 
these thresholds, the consistent negative monotonic rela-
tionships for all forms of digital-screen time (bs ≤ −0.53, 
ps < .001, |d|s = 0.14–0.20) indicated a detrimental rela-
tion between screen time and mental well-being. These 
findings further support the Goldilocks hypothesis. It 
appears that with the exception of using smartphones 
during weekends, moderate digital activity as defined by 
the reported inflection points does not displace other, 
more enriching activities essential for adolescents to 
experience mental well-being. Devoting time to smart-
phone screens during weekends may be an exception 
because socializing through virtual means when time is 
otherwise unstructured may be particularly susceptible to 
dysregulation or may indeed displace other beneficial 
weekend social activities (Ryan, Bernstein, & Brown, 
2010).
Observed effect sizes. Although it is not typical for 
publications on effects of digital activities to qualify sta-
tistically significant differences by reporting the amount 
of variability that is accounted for by these recreational 
activities, doing so is crucial for understanding the scope 
of the potential influence of screen time. In this study, we

found that the average effect size (Cohen’s d) for engage-
ment in excess of the inflection points was –0.18. In other 
words, these negative slopes accounted for 1.0% or less 
of the observed variability in the mental well-being of the 
young people in the sample. Exploratory analyses exam-
ining links between individual difference measures in the 
data set and well-being provide some context to interpret 
these modest relationships. These analyses indicated that 
the possible negative effects of excessive screen time 
were less than a third of the size of the positive associa-
tions between well-being and eating breakfast regularly 
(d = 0.54) or getting regular sleep (d = 0.58). Although 
the coefficients we have reported are statistically signifi-
cant, it is noteworthy that the size of both the linear and 
the quadratic relations between screen time and well-
being were noticeably diminished in half the cases once 
control factors were accounted for, and that incremental 
increases in screen time above moderate levels accounted 
for very little of the variability we observed in mental 
well-being.
Discussion
In this study, we found that the relationships between dig-
ital-screen time and mental well-being are nonlinear and 
that moderate engagement in digital activities is not harm-
ful. The consistently observed concave-down quadratic 
relations and empirically derived inflection points provide 
evidence supporting our Goldilocks hypothesis, indicating 
that post hoc screen-time groupings featured in past 
research oversimplify the nature of the relations between 
digital-screen time and adolescents’ well-being. We quanti-
fied moderate screen engagement and found that the cat-
egories of digital activity we examined are unlikely to

 Screen Time and Well-Being

present a material risk to mental well-being at these mod-
erate levels, although high levels of engagement may have 
a measurable, albeit small, negative influence. These find-
ings are all firsts, perhaps because previous studies used 
omnibus measures that did not differentiate between the 
diverse types of digital-screen use (Sisson et al., 2010) and 
measured doses of screen time on the basis of arbitrary 
cutoffs (Hamer et al., 2009). Such approaches are limited 
because they discard informative variance and therefore 
pool nonharmful and potentially harmful amounts of 
engagement when effects are estimated.
This study informs the field in a number of ways. We 
discuss two here. First, this study points to the value of 
considering the wider social and developmental contexts 
surrounding digital-screen use. The relation between 
screen time and well-being depended, in part, on whether 
the activities occurred on weekdays or weekends. The 
adolescents could engage in digital activities between 22 
min and 2 hr 13 min longer on weekend days than on 
weekdays before we found evidence of negative effects. 
Second, we found evidence that not all digital activities 
are “created equal.” Those that were pervasive (i.e., using 
smartphones) or required effortful task switching (i.e., 
playing video games) had noticeably lower inflection 
points on weekdays compared with other digital activi-
ties. It is possible that some tech activities do interfere 
with other structured activities during weekdays. For 
example, it is likely that adolescents are less likely to 
engage in academic pursuits if they are overusing certain 
forms of media on weekdays (Junco, 2012), and it may 
also be the case that these adolescents are less engaged 
in structured after-school activities that support intraper-
sonal and social development, and as a result promote 
well-being (Fletcher, Nickerson, & Wright, 2003). Despite

these possibilities, our statistical models suggested that 
the possible harmful influence of screen time on young 
people is fairly small, even if one assumes that our cor-
relational data indicate direct causal relations.

 Screen Time and Well-Being

with, well-being, it is possible that digital technologies, 
when used in moderation, afford measurable advantages 
to adolescents. These benefits may include avenues for 
communication, creativity, and development (Granic, 
Lobel, & Engels, 2014). In future work, researchers should 
look more closely at how specific affordances intrinsic to 
digital technologies relate to benefits at various levels of 
engagement, while systematically analyzing what is being 
displaced or amplified. For example, many popular 
games, such as Minecraft, provide a context for socializ-
ing and creativity, and smartphone-based activities like 
geocaching provide motivation for physical activity and 
discovery (O’Hara, 2008). Engaging in these games and 
activities may not displace anything meaningful for devel-
opment, whereas channel surfing and solitary reading 
might. Research building on these findings might exam-
ine nonlinear effects over time, and could consider effects 
on people both younger and older than the adolescents 
we sampled. Finally, future studies should use conver-
gent data sources from caregivers, peers, and teachers to 
evaluate the linear and nonlinear relations between 
screen time and well-being. This approach would mini-
mize the negative influence of extreme “mischievous 
responding” (Robinson-Cimpian, 2014), which might 
have exaggerated the links we observed between screen 
time and well-being, particularly among our respondents 
who reported unrealistically high levels of technology 
use. More important, use of other data sources would 
provide a further robust test of the Goldilocks 
hypothesis.
Closing remarks
These findings highlight the need to revisit broad-stroke 
recommendations grounded in the displacement hypoth-
esis (Brown, Shifrin, & Hill, 2015) and offer a new way to 
understand the existing research that legitimates those 
recommendations. Our results indicated that the possible 
deleterious relation between media use and well-being 
may not be as practically significant as some researchers 
have argued (Strasburger, Donnerstein, & Bushman, 
2014), and they highlight the continued need to critically 
reevaluate research claims that go beyond the available 
evidence (for more on this, see Ferguson & Donnellan, 
2014). Our findings also suggest the need for a careful 
cost-benefit analysis of existing professional advice—
which at present supports allocating valuable pediatri-
cian consultation time to discussing media use with 
caregivers. Future research and recommendations build-
ing on the Goldilocks hypothesis would be sensitive to 
the various types and contexts of media use and would 
be based on peaks and drops in well-being as well as 
other meaningful outcomes identified systematically. 
Paired with open-science practices, such as preregistration 
of statistical analyses, which limits researcher degrees of 
freedom (Simmons, Nelson, & Simonsohn, 2011), our 
analytic approach can form the basis for new robust stud-
ies in this area (Morey et al., 2016). There is good reason 
to think that caregivers find it extremely difficult to 
enforce existing guidelines regarding digital-screen time 
(Houghton et al., 2015), and that other factors, such as 
whether caregivers actively join in with their children 
during tech activities, may be far more important for 
mental well-being.
