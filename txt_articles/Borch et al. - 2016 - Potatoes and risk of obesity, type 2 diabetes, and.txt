ABSTRACT
Background: Potatoes have been related to increased risks of obe-
sity, type 2 diabetes (T2D), and cardiovascular disease (CVD)
mainly because of their high glycemic index.
Objective: We conducted a systematic review to evaluate the re-
lation between intake of potatoes and risks of obesity, T2D, and
CVD in apparently healthy adults.
Design: MEDLINE, Embase, the Web of Science, and the Cochrane
Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched for intervention and
prospective observational studies that investigated adults without any
known illnesses at baseline, recorded intake of potatoes, and measured
adiposity (body weight, body mass index, or waist circumference),
cases of T2D, cases of cardiovascular events, or risk markers thereof.
Results: In total, 13 studies were deemed eligible; 5 studies were
related to obesity, 7 studies were related to T2D, and one study was
related to CVD. Only observational studies were identified; there
were 3 studies with moderate, 9 studies with serious, and one study
with critical risk of bias. The association between potatoes (not
including french fries) and adiposity was neutral in 2 studies and
was positive in 2 studies. French fries were positively associated
with adiposity in 3 of 3 studies. For T2D, 2 studies showed a positive
association, whereas 5 studies showed no or a negative association
with intake of potatoes and T2D. French fries were positively as-
sociated with T2D in 3 of 3 studies that distinguished this relation.
For CVD, no association was observed.
Conclusions: The identified studies do not provide convincing ev-
idence to suggest an association between intake of potatoes and
risks of obesity, T2D, or CVD. French fries may be associated with
increased risks of obesity and T2D although confounding may be
present. In this systematic review, only observational studies were
identified. These findings underline the need for long-term random-
ized controlled trials. This trial was registered at the PROSPERO
International prospective register of systematic reviews (www.crd.
york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/) as CRD42015026491.

INTRODUCTION
Overweight and obesity have become primary public health
concerns globally (1). The conditions are related to physiologically
unfavorable effects on metabolism such as insulin resistance, hy-
pertension, and dyslipidemia, which, together with central adi-
posity, have been characterized as the metabolic syndrome (2, 3).
Compared with individuals without the metabolic syndrome, in-
dividuals with the metabolic syndrome have 5-fold increased risk of
developing type 2 diabetes (T2D)3 and 2-fold increased risk of
suffering from a cardiovascular event (2).
Potatoes are a predominant staple in most diets of the Western
world and the primary nongrain food item produced globally (4).
Starch is the major nutrient in potatoes [9–23% of raw weight
depending on the variety (5)], and potatoes are generally con-
sidered a high–glycemic index (GI) food (6). Compared with
other carbohydrate sources, potatoes have a low energy density
because of their high water content (7). In addition to starch,
potatoes provide potassium, vitamin C, phosphorus, magnesium,
folate, dietary fiber, and polyphenols (8). The high content of
potassium in potatoes may be of importance in some populations
because it has recently been shown that US children (aged 1–3 y)
consumed too little potassium (9) and that intake of potatoes may
help children to reach recommended intakes (10).
Evidence from single-meal test studies has suggested that
intake of boiled potatoes increased satiety compared with intake
of other preparations of potatoes or carbohydrate sources such as
rice, bread, and pasta on an energy-equivalent basis (11, 12). A
likely explanation of these findings may be the larger volume of
potato portions than of energy-equivalent portions of rice and
pasta (12). However, to our knowledge, how these short-term
effects translate into long-term risk has yet to be established.
The main mechanisms proposed for the possible adverse ef-
fects of potatoes have been attributed to the GI (8). Some authors
have proposed that a high-GI diet promotes weight gain by
redirecting nutrients from oxidation in muscle tissue to storage as
fat (13). Furthermore, intake of a high-GI diet has been suggested

 to cause T2D through an increased strain on insulin-producing
pancreatic b cells, which, over years, could cause b cell ex-
haustion and lead to glucose intolerance and T2D (14). Another
consequence of sustained elevated blood glucose concentrations
may be increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) because
of endothelial damage that is mediated through pro-oxidant ef-
fects of glucose in the endothelium (15).
Because potatoes are one of the most common food items in
diets of Western societies, the lack of consensus on their role in
a healthy diet warrants further investigation. Therefore, the
purpose of the current study was to conduct a systematic review
to evaluate the evidence on the relation between potatoes and
risks of obesity, T2D, and CVD in apparently healthy adults.
METHODS
This systematic review was carried out in accordance with the
guidelines presented by Moher et al. (16). Before conducting this
review, a protocol, which was constructed in alignment with the
Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-
Analysis Protocols statement (17), was uploaded to the PROSPERO
International prospective register of systematic reviews (www.
crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO; CRD42015026491).
Search strategy
A systematic search was performed with the following data-
bases: MEDLINE via PubMed (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/
pubmed/) from 1953 onward, Embase via Ovid (http://www.
embase.com) from 1980 onward, the Web of Science (http://
apps.webofknowledge.com/) from 1900 onward, and the Cochrane
Register of Controlled Trials (http://www.cochranelibrary.com)
from 1999 onward. All databases were searched until 20 October
2015. The search combined key words for potatoes with key
words for overweight and obesity, T2D, and CVD. In addition,
a “NOT” term was added to filter clearly irrelevant records. In
Embase, this addition was not possible, and thus, relevant fil-
ters were added in exchange. For a complete search strategy, see
Supplemental Methods (Online Search Strategy). Reference
lists of included studies and relevant reviews on the topic were
searched to find additional potential relevant literature, and known
experts in the field were contacted regarding their knowledge
of relevant studies.
Study selection
All intervention and prospective observational studies in
humans, not including single-meal intervention studies, were
considered eligible if they 1) included adults (age $18 y); 2)
included subjects without a diagnosis of diabetes or who had not
suffered any type of cardiovascular event previously or at
baseline; 3) recorded intake with the use of a food-frequency
questionnaire or intervened with the use of white or yellow
potatoes; and 4) measured adiposity [weight, waist circumfer-
ence (WC), or changes of these measures], cases of T2D, car-
diovascular events, or $1 of the following risk markers: blood
glucose, serum or plasma insulin, blood lipids, blood pres-
sure, or any measure derived from these variables. Intervention
studies were only considered eligible if they compared intake of
potatoes with other sources of carbohydrate or different prepa-
rations of potatoes. Studies that investigated specific kinds of
potatoes other than white or yellow potatoes (e.g., sweet or
purple potatoes) were excluded because of the disparities in
nutrient and antioxidant compositions (18). Patients with any
known mental illnesses or who were taking any form of medi-
cation that affected carbohydrate uptake were excluded.
Two authors independently screened titles and abstracts
generated from the search. After the identification of potentially
eligible literature, the same 2 authors assessed these articles in
full text according to the eligibility criteria. Any disagreements in
the review process were resolved by a discussion, and if required,
a third party resolved additional disagreements.
Data extraction and quality assessment
Four authors independently extracted data from the eligible
studies with the use of a data-collection template that was pre-
viously designed. The data that were extracted from intervention
studies were as follows: 1) general information [i.e., title, authors,
year of publication, and origin of the sample (country)]; 2) par-
ticipant characteristics [i.e., total number, percentage of women,
BMI (in kg/m2), and the mean or range of age]; 3) trial charac-
teristics (i.e., design and duration); 4) the intervention (i.e., a di-
etary intervention and comparison); and 5) the outcome (i.e., the
change in body weight, WC, or risk markers). For observational
studies, the extraction of data 1 and 2 were similar to that in the
intervention studies, and the remaining data extractions included
3) trial characteristics (i.e., the duration of follow-up); 4) exposure
(i.e., potato preparation, assessment method, and intake fre-
quency); 5) statistical method; and 6) outcome (i.e., mean weight
change; mean WC change; RRs and ORs for obesity, T2D, and
CVD; and baseline means or medians of outcome measures).
Weight recorded in pounds was converted to kilograms by using
a conversion factor (i.e., 1 lb = 0.45 kg).
Risk-of-bias assessments of the individual studies were con-
ducted independently by 2 authors according to the Cochrane
Collaboration’s tool for the assessment of risk of bias in ran-
domized trials (19) and nonrandomized studies of interventions
(20). For randomized controlled trials, the following 7 sources of
bias were considered for evaluation: random-sequence genera-
tion, allocation concealment, blinding of participants and per-
sonnel, blinding of the outcome assessment, an incomplete
outcome analysis, selective reporting, and anything else that,
ideally, was prespecified (19). Similarly, for prospective obser-
vational studies, the following 7 domains were assessed: bias
because of confounding, bias in the selection of participants in
the study, bias in the measurement of interventions, bias because
of departures from intended interventions, bias because of
missing data, bias in the measurement of outcomes, and bias in
the selection of the reported result (20). For additional details,
see Supplemental Methods (Quality Assessment Tool) and
Supplemental Table 1. The assessment of risk of bias was done
at an outcome level because most studies that were identified did
not investigate potatoes as their primary outcome. A meta-
analysis was not performed because we judged that there was
substantial heterogeneity across identified studies.
RESULTS
The systematic literature search identified 1602 records of
which there were 1187 records after duplicates were removed

 (Figure 1). After the exclusion of articles by title and abstract,
103 articles were assessed in full text. Of these articles, 90 re-
cords were excluded. The most common reasons for exclusion
were as follows: not relevant publication type (e.g., an ecologic
or single-meal study), no relevant exposure (e.g., subjects were
provided a diet with both potatoes and other carbohydrate
sources), no relevant outcome, and a dietary pattern analysis that
included potatoes without a separate analysis for potatoes
and risk of obesity, T2D, or CVD. A total of 13 studies met
the inclusion criteria; all trials were prospective observational
studies. Five studies investigated overweight and obesity, 7
studies investigated T2D, and one study investigated CVD.
Overweight and obesity
No long-term intervention studies were shown to be eligible.
Five observational studies (21–25) that investigated the associ-
ation between intake of potatoes and overweight and obesity
were identified (Table 1). Follow-up ranged between 2 and 20 y,
and 170,413 subjects were included with BMIs that ranged from
normal weight to obese. All studies used multivariate linear
regression to estimate the association between intake of potatoes
and measures of adiposity.
Overall, in studies that investigated potatoes (not specified for
the preparation type or not including french fries), 2 studies
showed a positive association with measures of adiposity (21,
22), and 2 studies showed no association with measures of ad-
iposity (24, 25). Mozaffarian et al. (21), who conducted a large,
prospective pooled cohort study, showed that increased con-
sumption of 1 serving/d of all types of potatoes combined was
associated with a mean body-weight gain of 0.58 kg over a period
of 4 y. Of the different types of potato preparations, boiled, baked,
and mashed potatoes were associated with the least weight gain
(0.26 kg), and french fries were associated with the most weight
gain (1.52 kg). Halkjær et al. (24) looked at WC and showed no
association between intake of potatoes and WC. However, in
a similar cohort study, an increase of 0.1 cm in WC over 5 y was
observed in women for each increase in potato intake of
60 kcal/d (not including intake of french fries) (22). In the 3
studies that investigated french fries separately, a positive as-
sociation between intake of french fries and measures of adi-
posity was shown (21, 23, 25). In 2 of these studies, it was shown
that intake of french fries had a stronger positive association with
both BMI (25) and weight gain (21) than did boiled, baked, or
mashed potatoes. Of the 5 identified studies that investigated
overweight and obesity outcomes, 3 studies explicitly stated the
preparation method of potatoes (21–23).
T2D
No intervention studies that focused on intake of potatoes and
risk of T2D were identified. Seven prospective observational
studies met the inclusion criteria; 6 studies were cohort studies
that lasted 4–20 y (26–31), and one study was a nested cohort
study with a 20-y follow-up (32) (Table 2). A total of 326,675
subjects aged $34 y with BMI ranging from normal weight to
obese were included in these studies. To estimate risk of T2D, 3
studies used Cox proportional hazards regression (26, 28, 30),
and 3 studies used logistic regression (27, 29, 31); a single study
used multivariate regression (32).
Overall, 2 studies observed a positive association (26, 27), 3
studies showed no association (29–31), and 2 studies showed
a negative association (28, 32) with intake of potatoes and T2D.
Both studies that observed increased risk of T2D for intake of
potatoes were large American cohort studies that included
women only (26, 27). However, in another American cohort
study that only included men, no association with T2D was
shown when the highest quintile of potato intake was compared
with the lowest quintile of potato intake (not including intake of
french fries) (29). Two of the 6 studies, one of which was
a prospective cohort (28) and the other of which was a nested
cohort (32), showed decreased risk of T2D (although no CI was
reported) when the highest quintile of potato intake was com-
pared with the lowest quintile of potato intake and a negative
association between intake of potatoes and 2-h plasma glucose,
respectively. Looking at intake of french fries only, a positive
association with T2D was shown in both women and men in 3 of
3 large cohort studies that explicitly investigated french fries
(26, 27, 29).
Two cohort studies stratified by BMI; Halton et al. (26) ob-
served a positive association between potatoes and T2D in

 subjects with BMI $30 but not in subjects with BMI ,30. The
positive association between intake of french fries and T2D was
persistent in both subgroups when the fifth quintile of intake was
compared with the first quintile of intake. In contrast, Liu et al.
(30) investigated women with BMI $25 and showed no asso-
ciation with T2D when the highest quintile of potato intake was
compared with the lowest quintile of potato intake.
CVD
A single study (33) that investigated CVD was deemed eligible
(Table 3). The study consisted of 2 large American cohort
populations with follow-up durations of 8 and 14 y. In total,
114,276 subjects were included with BMI ranging from normal
weight to obese. No association between intake of potatoes (not
specified) and risk of ischemic stroke was shown when the
highest quintile of intake was compared with the lowest quintile
of intake in a multivariate logistic regression analysis.
DISCUSSION
This systematic review identified 13 studies that investigated
the relation between intake of potatoes and risks of overweight
and obesity, T2D, and CVD. All trials were prospective obser-
vational studies, and no long-term intervention studies were
identified. For potatoes, the observational studies observed in-
consistent results in relation to overweight and obesity and T2D.
In contrast, french fries were more consistently positively as-
sociated with adiposity and T2D. The single cohort study that
investigated CVD showed no relation between intake of potatoes
and CVD.
Overweight and obesity
In the studies that investigated potatoes (not specified for the
preparation type or not including french fries), 2 trials showed
a positive association with measures of adiposity (21, 22). Both
studies had moderate risk of bias. More specifically, intake of
boiled, baked, and mashed potatoes was associated with a slight
increase in body weight in both sexes (21) and an increase in WC
in women only (22). However, because no long-term randomized
controlled trials were found, the evidence was of limited quality.
Therefore, we allude to a cautious interpretation of these results.
Although the majority of the cohort studies adjusted for known
confounders, the observed positive associations between potatoes
and body weight may still have been confounded by unmeasured
factors of an unhealthy lifestyle. Moreover, the use of different
types of covariates in the analyses could have provided different
and possibly misleading results (34).
The effect on adiposity was modified when the potato prep-
aration was considered, although only a few studies managed to
specify the preparation type explicitly. When the analyses sep-
arated intake of french fries from intake of other potato prepa-
rations, intake of french fries showed a stronger association with
weight gain than intake of potatoes (21, 25). This result may have
been due to the higher energy density of french fries than of
baked, boiled, and mashed potatoes (8). However, because these
were observational studies, we could not completely exclude
confounding because of an unhealthy lifestyle that was possibly
related to intake of french fries (35).
T2D
The results from the observational studies that investigated
potatoes were mixed. However, french fries were shown to be
associated with T2D in the 3 studies that distinguished the
preparation type (26, 27, 29). Although french fries have a lower
GI than boiled, baked, or mashed potatoes do, they still contribute
to the glycemic load, which has been associated with increased
risk of T2D (36). Furthermore, french fries normally contain
large amounts of fat, which can contribute to increased energy
intake and, thereby, risks of overweight and T2D.
In contrast to the results of 2 large American cohorts (26, 27),
a large cohort study of Chinese women showed decreased risk of
T2D with higher intake of potatoes (28). This discrepancy could
perhaps be explained by differences in dietary habits. Median
intake of potatoes in the Chinese population was 8.1 g/d, whereas
median potato intake in the US-population studies was 43.5 g/d
[converted to g/d as 1 serving = 1 baked potato (w150 g)] (26).
Dietary intake of potatoes in the Chinese population resembled
their intake of vegetables. In addition, the main carbohydrate
source in their diets was white rice, which was positively as-
sociated with T2D. Therefore, it could be speculated that the
total amount of carbohydrates consumed was more important
than the carbohydrate food source. In addition, high potato in-
take has been related to a Western dietary pattern, which has
also been associated with risk of T2D (37). For example, Halton
et al. (26) showed that intake of red meat was positively cor-
related with intake of potatoes (r = 0.24, P , 0.0001), and when
adjusted for red meat intake, the association was attenuated al-
though it remained significant. However, adjustment for single
dietary factors may not remove potentially harmful synergistic
effects of an unhealthy lifestyle. Thus, there may still have been
confounding by other foods and behaviors.
Overweight and obesity are known risk factors of T2D mainly
through decreased insulin sensitivity (16). Halton et al. (26)
showed that high intake of potatoes was not associated with
increased risk of T2D in subjects with BMI ,30. Furthermore,
Liu et al. (30) did not find any association in subjects with BMI
$25. These results could suggest that potatoes may only be
associated with risk of T2D in obese individuals. However, this
possibility needs to be further investigated.
CVD
The single prospective cohort study that we identified showed
no association between intake of potatoes and risk of ischemic
stroke. However, with only a single study investigating the re-
lation between intake of potatoes and risk of CVD, further in-
vestigation is warranted. Because specific potato preparations
were not investigated in this study, different effects of these
preparations could not be extrapolated.
Together, a limited number of studies were identified for all
outcomes. Few studies distinguished between potato prepara-
tions, which was a major limitation because different types of
preparations, such as boiled potatoes and french fries, differ
substantially with regards to energy density and the distribution
of carbohydrate and fat within similar portion sizes (11). Fur-
thermore, the overall eating behavior could be speculated to differ
between consumers of boiled potatoes and french fries. In the few
studies that separated intake into different potato preparations, it

 was still hard to exclude possible confounding from other foods
and lifestyle behaviors that were related to the choice of potato
preparation. Moreover, it is likely that different populations
choose different preparation methods, which further complicated
comparisons between studies. Thus, caution needs to be taken
when interpreting these studies.
To our knowledge, this is the first systematic review investi-
gating the role of potatoes in relation to risks of obesity, T2D, and
CVD. The strengths of this review include a systematic approach
that was done in accordance with a priori search criteria and an
independent literature search, data extraction, and quality as-
sessment. The search did not include key words on vegetables
because a vast amount of hits were produced. A few of the large
cohort studies that were included investigated vegetables, in-
cluding potatoes, without any indication of this inclusion in either
the title or abstract. However, through reference lists, we consider
that the main parts of these studies were identified.
In conclusion, the reviewed studies do not provide strong ev-
idence of an association between intake of potatoes and risks of
obesity, T2D, and CVD. French fries may be associated with
increased risks of obesity and T2D although confounding may
have been present. There are also preliminary indications that
subjects with BMI $30 may be more vulnerable to intake of
potatoes in relation to risk of T2D regardless of the preparation
type. Because of the importance of potatoes as a food source in
some populations, these conclusions warrant further investigation.
Notably, the fact that only long-term studies of observational
character could be identified, most of which were of low quality,
underlines the need for long-term randomized controlled trials.
