Results We developed a model with five domains incor-
porating all the concepts relevant to social isolation in regu-
lar use in the mental health research literature. These five 
domains are: social network—quantity; social network—
structure; social network—quality; appraisal of relation-
ships—emotional; and appraisal of relationships—resources. 
We also identified well-developed measures suitable for 
assessing each of the five conceptual domains or covering 
multi-domains.
Conclusions Our review proposes a conceptual model to 
encompass and differentiate all terms relating to social isola-
tion. Potential uses are in allowing researchers and interven-
tion developers to identify precisely the intended outcomes 
of interventions, and to choose the most appropriate meas-
ures to use in mental health settings.

Introduction
There has been a growing realisation among policy mak-
ers and practitioners that social relations play an influen-
tial role in mental health and psychological wellbeing [1], 
and that service users themselves place high importance 
on them. Feelings of loneliness are greater and social 
network size is smaller among mental health service 
users than in the general population [2–5]. The previous 
studies have identified an association between loneliness 
and depression [6, 7], suicidal behaviour [8], personality 
disorders [9], and psychoses [10]. Among people with 
severe mental illness, social isolation has been linked to 
higher levels of delusions [11], lack of insight [12], and 
high hospital usage [13]. Conversely, people who report 
Abstract 
Purpose Social isolation and related concepts have been 
discussed increasingly in the field of mental health. Despite 
this, there is a lack of conceptual clarity and consistency in 
the definition and operationalisation of these terms. This 
review aimed to provide a clear framework for social isola-
tion and related concepts, and to identify well-established 
measures in the field of mental health for each conceptual 
domain discussed.
Methods We used an iterative strategy of expert consulta-
tion and literature searching. A multi-disciplinary group of 
senior academics was consulted both before and after the 
literature searching to identify relevant terms, conceptual 
papers, or recommended measures. Our conceptual frame-
work was also validated through expert consultation. We 
searched the Web of Science database using terms suggested 
by experts and subsequently identified further relevant stud-
ies through review articles and by reading full texts and ref-
erence lists of included studies. A narrative synthesis was 
conducted.

greater informal social support have been found more 
likely to recover from psychotic symptoms [14].
There is a lack of clarity around how social isolation, 
loneliness, and related concepts should be defined and 
measured [15, 16]. While social isolation has been linked 
to loneliness, they are not synonymous concepts [1, 17]. 
These, and related terms, including social networks, con-
fiding relationships, and social support, have multiple, 
often overlapping, meanings. Due to this lack of clar-
ity, researchers sometimes use these terms loosely and 
interchangeably [18]. In this review, we focus entirely on 
social relations as they are experienced at the individual 
level. A higher order sociological approach looks at how 
people relate to each other within a society. Concepts 
including ecological social capital, relating to the qual-
ity of social relationships within a community, social 
exclusion, relating to an enforced lack of participation 
in mainstream social, cultural, economic, and political 
activities and social inclusion, relating to individuals’ 
access to resources and participation in economic, politi-
cal, and social activity, can be distinguished from con-
cepts which focus on relationships at the individual level, 
such as social isolation.
Existing reviews have provided an overview of the cur-
rent conceptual and methodological literature on social 
exclusion [19, 20] and social capital [21, 22]. In their 
1988 review, House and colleagues identified the struc-
tures and processes through which social relationships 
influence health [23, 24]. Since then, a literature on social 
relationships and mental health has emerged, in which 
explicit reference to an overarching conceptual frame 
work is generally not made. Our goal in this paper is to 
examine the concepts in use in this literature, the extent to 
which they can be synthesised into a coherent framework, 
and the match between this conceptual framework and 
others applied to examining associations between aspects 
of health and social relationships. A recently published 
conceptual review investigated measures of loneliness, 
social isolation, and social relationships at the individual 
level, focusing on older adults and cardiovascular disease 
populations [18]. Our current review adds to this under-
standing, being the first to review the use and measure-
ment of social isolation and related concepts in the field 
of mental health.
The aim of this review is to provide a comprehensive 
framework for social isolation and related concepts, and 
to identify examples of different measurement tools, high-
lighting the best established measures in the field of men-
tal health. It can help future researchers to decide exactly 
what they want to measure and how to go about it.
Method
Overall approach
Conceptual and methodological reviews differ from system-
atic reviews of effects. The exact scope and procedures of 
conceptual reviews are established through the process of 
conducting the review. We followed Lilford and colleagues’ 
recommendations for conducting methodological reviews 
[25] and used an iterative and consultative process to 
achieve a clear understanding of social isolation and related 
concepts. This included: searching widely using a variety 
of databases and sources; making sure that the review is 
informed by expert advice, including social science, psy-
chological and medical perspectives; allowing some over-
lap in the various stages of the review process, so that the 
final scope and findings of the review could be clarified in 
response to interim findings and feedback.
Literature search
Our iterative search strategy involved: (1) expert consulta-
tion to identify relevant terms, conceptual papers, or rec-
ommended measures; (2) literature search, data extraction, 
and conceptual map development; (3) expert consultation 
to validate the conceptual framework. Detailed process is 
described below:
Expert consultation First, we consulted a multi-discipli-
nary group of London experts in social aspects of mental 
health to identify relevant terms for our literature search. 
Second, following the initial literature searching, we 
extracted data which informed the development of a draft 
conceptual map with several domains to fit all identified 
relevant concepts. Then, we consulted this same group and 
contacted 15 international experts identified through the 
initial literature searching, to present our draft conceptual 
map, seeking feedback and suggestions. These international 
experts have relevant subject expertise within and outside of 
the field of mental health.
Literature search Using terms suggested by the experts, 
we searched the Web of Science database on 23rd April 
2015 for papers defining social isolation and related terms, 
or the methods of measurement for these concepts. Search 
terms for social isolation and related terms (social isola-
tion OR loneliness OR social network* OR social support 
OR confiding OR confide OR social contact* OR social 
relation* OR social capital) were combined with terms 
for mental disorders [mental OR psychiatr* OR schizo* 
OR psychosis OR psychotic OR depress* OR mania* OR 
manic OR bipolar near/5 (disorder or disease or illness) OR 
anxiety]. Time limits for the initial search were restricted 
to 1st January 2013–23rd April 2015 as a high volume of 
articles was retrieved initially. Web of Science was selected 
 1453

1 3
as an inter-disciplinary database covering a wide range 
of subject areas. Reference lists of studies identified were 
hand-searched for other relevant studies, without time limit. 
Wherever a paper retrieved for full-text screening referred 
to another potentially relevant study, this too was retrieved 
and screened.
From the initial database search, studies proposing a defi-
nition or measure of a concept relating to social isolation 
and applying this concept or measure to the field of adult 
mental health were included. Studies of children under 16 
and learning disability/organic disorder populations were 
excluded. Studies with no explicit definition of social isola-
tion or related concepts, or those not using well-developed 
measures, e.g., single item, were excluded. Where concepts/
measures used in a mental health context had originally been 
developed in other fields, the original source was retrieved 
and reviewed.
Data extraction and synthesis
We extracted information on definitions of social isolation 
and related terms, and on approaches to its measurement, 
using an electronic data extraction form developed for this 
review. The initial screening was conducted by single review 
authors (JW, BLE, RF, CN, and FM), with regular meetings 
between review authors to address uncertainties about inclu-
sion where necessary and check that a consistent approach 
to screening was applied.
A narrative approach was adopted to synthesise findings. 
This comprised three stages.
 i. Review authors developed a set of conceptual domains 
covering all elements within identified existing con-
ceptualisations of social isolation and related terms 
retrieved.
 ii. The validity of this conceptual framework was then 
assessed referring to the existing literature. All 
included papers from the literature search were cross-
referenced with the domains developed, to check 
whether our conceptual map was sufficiently compre-
hensive to include all relevant concepts and was not 
adding additional domains not covered in the literature. 
A record of the retrieved concepts which we reviewed 
and how we mapped them to the domains of our con-
ceptual framework is provided in Supplementary File 
1, Table 1–7.
 
iii. Measures of social isolation and related concepts iden-
tified by our literature search were reviewed and best 
examples of suitable measures for each proposed con-
ceptual domains were identified. Measures with good 
established psychometric properties, demonstrated 
applicability, and wide use in mental health settings 
were prioritised. The initial selection of appropriate 
measures was undertaken by single review authors 
(JW, BLE, RF, CN, and FM); review authors met to 
agree the final selection based on above criteria.
Further consultation with experts was conducted to 
improve and validate the conceptual model and to identify 
any further relevant literature or concepts not included. We 
persisted in this process until no new concepts or measure-
ment tools emerged.
Results
Our electronic database search identified 5437 papers. After 
full-text screening of papers from electronic search and 
from reference lists and review articles, we included 277 
papers discussing concepts relating to social isolation. We 
also retrieved 425 papers presenting measures of relevant 
concepts, including 191 original papers developing these 
measures. Of these, we have reported 16 in our review: those 
most widely used in the field of mental health, with the best 
established psychometric properties.
Definitions and brief explanation of relevant concepts
In this section, a brief summary of the ways in which social 
isolation and related terms have been conceptualised is pro-
vided. A fuller description is provided in Electronic Sup-
plementary Material 2. These concepts have been widely 
cited in mental health research, although not all of them 
originated in the field of mental health.
Social isolation
Models of social isolation include both objective social con-
tact and subjective perceived adequacy of contact. Zavaleta 
et al. [26] defined social isolation as “inadequate quality and 
quantity of social relations with other people at the individ-
ual, group, community, and larger social environment levels 
where human interaction takes place”.
Loneliness
Loneliness is a painful subjective emotional state occurring 
when there is a discrepancy between desired and achieved 
patterns of social interaction [27, 28]. It is thus conceptual-
ised as an entirely subjective state, not necessarily dependent 
on the quantity of someone’s social relations.
Social support
Two domains are usually distinguished and measured within 
the overarching concept of social support: functional social 
 1454
 
Soc Psychiatry Psychiatr Epidemiol (2017) 52:1451–1461
1 3
support, the functions fulfilled by social relations, and struc-
tural social support, the existence, quantity, and properties of 
social relations [29]. Many measures of social support assess 
three components, spanning both structural and functional 
domains: social network and social integration variables, 
received support, and perceived support [30, 31].
Social network
Social network refers to an individual’s connections among 
a group of people, the characteristics of which are used to 
interpret the social behaviour of people involved [32]. This 
includes objective, morphological characteristics such as 
network size, degree and density, and interactional charac-
teristics including network intensity and directionality [33].
Social capital
Social capital is generally understood as a series of 
resources that individuals earn as a result of their mem-
bership in social networks, and the features of those net-
works that facilitate coordination and cooperation for 
mutual benefit. It can be understood as the property of an 
individual (individual social capital), or of a community 
(ecological social capital) [34–36]. It can also be divided 
into structural and cognitive social capital [37, 38] or 
bonding and bridging social capital [38, 39].
Confiding relationships
Measures of confiding relationships rate the degree of 
closeness to and intimacy someone has with another per-
son, or specified other people [40, 41].
Alienation
Bronfenbrenner [42] defined alienation as “the feeling of 
disconnectedness from social settings, such that the indi-
vidual views his/her relationships from social contexts as 
no longer tenable”.
A model of social isolation and related concepts
Our review of conceptual definitions enabled us to generate 
a conceptual model of social isolation and related terms. 
Our aim was to develop a set of defined domains that would 
encompass all the frequently used concepts, avoiding over-
lap or duplication. We developed and corroborated this 
model by checking the match of the concepts identified to 
our model domains, and iteratively consulting experts. We 
propose five conceptual domains that are comprehensive 
enough to encompass all elements of current conceptualisa-
tions: social network—quantity; social network—structure; 
social network—quality; appraisal of relationships—emo-
tional; and appraisal of relationships—resources. Table 1 
summarizes how these five domains map on to the existing 
conceptual terms.
Supplementary Tables 1–7 provide further information 
about the existing conceptual definitions of social isolation 
and related terms, and how the components of these defini-
tions map on to our proposed five domains. Definitions of 
our five conceptual domains are as follows:
Network (Quantity) refers to quantity of social contact; 
e.g., the number of people in someone’s social network, 
number or frequency of someone’s social contacts over a 
period of time.
Network (Structure) refers to characteristics of social 
contacts, not involving any appraisal of the quality of the 
relationship: e.g., network density (how many of the people 
in someone’s social network also know each other), and the

characteristics of someone’s social contacts (e.g., how many 
are kin, colleagues, mental health staff, or mental health ser-
vice users).
Network (Quality) refers to the perceived quality of rela-
tionships. This domain includes measures of the quality of 
specific important relationships (e.g., partner and parents). 
It also includes measures of qualitative information about all 
someone’s individual social contacts (e.g., rating how many 
of someone’s social contacts are friends, how many could be 
confided in, and how many would be missed).
Appraisal of relationships (Emotional) refers to overall 
appraisal of the perceived adequacy or impact of relation-
ships: e.g., loneliness or emotional social support. This 
domain does not directly relate to, and is not measured by, 
the number of or quality of specific individual relationships.
Appraisal of relationships (Resources) refers to perceived 
overall access to resources from someone’s social relation-
ships: e.g., tangible social support.
Our five domains enable three important distinctions to 
be made:
 i. Objective versus perceived qualities of someone’s 
social relationships: The ‘Network—size’ and ‘Net-
work—structure’ domains provide quantitative 
information about the number or structure of social 
contacts. ‘Network quality’ and the two relationship 
appraisal domains, by contrast, relate to qualitative 
appraisal of relationships or social connectedness.
 ii. Individual relationships versus overall social/inter-
personal connectedness: The three ‘network’ domains 
in our conceptual map relate to the quantity or quality 
of individual relationships. Information about these 
individual relationships may be summed to describe 
social connectedness and relationships overall. The 
two ‘appraisal of relationships’ domains relate to sub-
jective evaluation of relationships overall, without 
direct reference to specific individuals.
 
iii. Tangible (practical) and intangible (emotional) support 
from relationships: ‘Appraisal of relationship—emo-
tional’ refers to perceived companionship, love and 
emotional support derived from social/inter-personal 
relationships. ‘Appraisal of relationships—resources’ 
refers to instrumental (or tangible) support obtainable 
from social/inter-personal relationships.
There are elements of the existing conceptual terms which 
are not covered by our proposed five conceptual domains. 
These were excluded as they do not directly relate to social 
isolation or related concepts:
 i. Negative aspects of relationships: social isolation, 
loneliness, and related concepts are defined by the 
presence or absence of contact or desired support 
from relationships, rather than negative aspects of 
social relationships. However, concepts of relation-
ship quality, including expressed emotion, and some 
conceptualisations of social capital also consider the 
actively negative aspects of inter-personal relationships 
(such as criticism, or overinvolvement), which require 
the presence of social contact and may occur indepen-
dently of loneliness (see Supplementary Tables 5 and 
6).
 ii. Participation in social, economic or political activ-
ity: relevant to social inclusion, social exclusion, and 
included in some conceptualisations of social capital, 
e.g., most conceptualisations of structural social capi-
tal (see Supplementary Table 5).
 
iii. Degree of trust, perceived shared norms, or beliefs 
with society or institutions of power: conceptualisa-
tions of social capital and alienation both include con-
sideration at societal level of politico-legal and moral 
norms and requirements and how these are perceived 
and experienced by individuals (see Supplementary 
Tables 5 and 7).
Our resulting conceptual map of social isolation and 
related terms used in mental health research is presented 
in Fig. 1.
Measures
First, we describe measures suitable for assessing each of 
our five proposed conceptual domains of social isolation and 
related terms (Table 2). Second, we report multi-domain 
measures used primarily to provide a total score covering 
more than one of our identified conceptual domains. In both 
cases, we follow specified criteria in selecting measures, pri-
oritising those which: (1) have been used widely; (2) have 
adequate psychometric properties; (3) have been used in an 
adult mental health context.
Social network domains
Two measures most widely used to assess social network 
domains are the Social Network Schedule (SNS) [43] and 
the Network Analysis Profile (NAP) [44]. The Social Net-
work Schedule (SNS) [43] was designed to assess the social 
networks of mental health service users. It generates quanti-
tative data for the number of people in someone’s social net-
work; the number of people seen daily, weekly or monthly; 
the proportion of people in different roles within the net-
work; and the number of people who meet various qualita-
tive criteria, e.g. friends, confidants. The SNS has been used 
widely and internationally, in both community and inpatient 
mental health settings [45–50] and has demonstrated good 
inter-rater reliability [43] and construct validity [51]. Its 
 1456

1 3
criterion validity has also been established, with network 
size and number of confiding relationships associated with 
quality of life [52], and associated with and predictive of 
better social functioning [53].
Similar to the SNS, the NAP identifies the attributes of 
social contacts, the nature of interactions, and character-
istics of respondents’ networks. However, the validity and 
inter-rater reliability of the NAP are less well established 
than for the SNS, and it is too lengthy for most routine 
assessment and research contexts [54]. We, therefore, 
recommend the SNS for assessing all three conceptual 
domains relating to network properties.
While the SNS is able to measure three of our pro-
posed domains, scores for each measured variable can 
only be reported separately; no summary total score can

be generated. In this way, the SNS is distinct from multi-
domain measures described later.
Regarding network quantity, both network size (overall 
number of contacts seen at least monthly) and frequency 
of contacts (number of people seen daily/weekly/monthly) 
are of interest. For network structure, both network density 
(number of contacts also in contact with each other) and 
non-kin relationships are of interest as possible indicators 
of access to “weak ties” [55], which may promote access to 
information and resources, and recognition of social norms. 
The number of confidants and social contacts who would be 
missed has been identified in the SNS as good markers for 
relationship quality [51], and may be preferable to measur-
ing number of friends, because of the challenges of achiev-
ing a consistently understood definition of “a friend” [5, 56].
While the SNS assesses characteristics of all the social 
contacts in someone’s network, an alternative approach used 
with the general population [57] and adolescents [58] is to 
ask respondents to specify and rate the quality of a selected 
number of their closest relationships. Where such meas-
ures can be used to assess any type of relationship, they are 
potentially useful to provide an aggregate score relating to 
network quality. Our review did not find measures validated 
in mental health settings using this approach, but potentially 
appropriate, well-established relationship quality measures 
are described in Supplementary File 1, Table 8.
Appraisal of relationship domains
Emotional appraisal: Loneliness measures have been well 
established and used in mental health settings to assess the 
overall perceived adequacy of relationships in providing 
emotional support.
The University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA) 
Loneliness Scale (version 3) [59] is widely used in the 
general population and clinical research [59–61]. This uni-
dimensional, 20-item scale assesses the frequency and inten-
sity of the current experience of loneliness [62]. Good inter-
nal consistency and test–retest reliability after 12 months 
have been established, and good construct validity, compris-
ing convergent and discriminant validity and the validity 
of a uni-dimensional factor structure [59]. An eight-item 
short-form version has later been developed, which was also 
reported as reliable and valid [63].
The de Jong-Gierveld Loneliness Scale is another com-
monly used loneliness measure. From an original 34-item 
multidimensional scale, [64], an 11-item scale was devel-
oped. This short version is easier to administer and more 
suitable for lonely and non-lonely respondents [64]. Good 
psychometric properties have been established [62, 64, 65]. 
An even shorter six-item version has also been developed for 
use in large surveys: three items assess emotional loneliness 
and three assess social loneliness [66, 67].
Resource appraisal Instruments exclusively measuring 
the perceived ability of social contacts to help with access to 
resources are few. This domain is often included in broader 
measures of social support or social capital.
The Resource Generator-UK (RG-UK) [68] asks about 
access to 27 types of informational/practical support, gener-
ating a total measure of social network resource access. The 
scale comprises four sub-scales: domestic resources, expert 
advice, personal skills, and problem-solving resources. The 
measure has good validity and reliability [68], and is fea-
sible for use in mental health settings [69]. It is limited by 
its culturally specific UK context, and is likely to require 
future adaptation to ensure validity in different eras or cul-
tural contexts [68].
Multi-domain measures
Our review also identified numerous measures covering 
more than one of our proposed conceptual domains. In par-
ticular, our review supports Huxley and Webber’s observa-
tion [70] that “measures of social support are as varied as 
the number of investigators”. These measures, while often 
comprised of sub-scales, generate and typically report a total 
score. Interpreting scores or the meaning of score change 
is, therefore, difficult, because measures reflect more than 
one distinct concept. We describe a number of these multi-
domain measures in Supplementary Table 8, prioritising 
measures most widely used in mental health settings and 
with demonstrated good psychometric properties.
Discussion
This review provides an overview of the existing definitions 
of social isolation and related terms and proposes a con-
ceptual model with five domains to include all elements of 
current conceptualisations: social network—quantity; social 
network—structure; social network—quality; appraisal of 
relationships—emotional; and appraisal of relationships—
resources. It identifies measures suitable for assessing each 
of the five conceptual domains or covering multi-domains.
Comparison with other conceptual reviews
House and colleagues [23] distinguished two structures 
of social relationships and support (social integration/iso-
lation and social network structure) and identified three 
social processes (social support, relational demands and 
conflicts, and social regulation or control). The domains 
of “Network: quantity” and “Network: structure” in 
our conceptual model correspond to the two structure 
domains in House’s framework, respectively. House’s 
model is broader in scope than ours as: (1) the negative 
 1458
 
Soc Psychiatry Psychiatr Epidemiol (2017) 52:1451–1461
1 3
or conflictive aspects of relationships were not covered in 
our model; and (2) the regulating or controlling quality of 
relationships was beyond the scope of our model due to its 
main focus on societal level rather than individual level 
relationships. However, House’s model did not include 
a person’s emotional response to lack of desired social 
interaction, and thus, loneliness cannot be subsumed 
under any of its categories. Given the increasing research 
focus on loneliness, a specific domain—“Appraisal of 
relationships (Emotional)” to cover this concept is impor-
tant for future research. In addition, social isolation in 
House’s model only refers to its external characteristics, 
while subjective social isolation which refers to personal 
attitudes not quantifiable by observation was not covered.
Valtorta and colleagues’ conceptual review of social 
isolation [18] looked at the literature outside the field of 
mental health, but their findings are highly compatible 
with ours. The four concepts measured by instruments 
included in their review (social support, social isolation, 
social network, and loneliness) were included in our 
review, which also considered measures of social capi-
tal, confiding relationships, and alienation. Valtorta and 
colleagues propose two domains of social relationships: 
(1) objective and structural; and (2) subjective and func-
tional. In our model, the domains of “network quantity” 
and “network structure” describe objective and struc-
tural characteristics of social relationships, while “net-
work quality”, and the two “appraisal of relationships” 
domains in our model describe functional and subjective 
characteristics.
Compared with the House’s and Valtorta’s conceptual 
framework, our model offers two further important con-
ceptual distinctions: (1) the characteristics of a person’s 
individual social relationships versus their relationships 
and inter-personal connectedness overall. For example, 
an individual who has a poor relationship with parents or 
partner could have enough supportive friendships, thereby 
generally not feeling socially isolated; and (2) emotional 
versus practical elements of the functional characteristics 
of social relationships. A more specific and explanatory 
framework is helpful for mental health research, because 
it allows distinction between individual difficulties and 
societal stigma, and it separates the emotional element, 
where subjective appraisal may be affected by mental 
illness symptoms, and the practical element that is less 
likely to be perceived differently because of psychological 
difficulties. The compatibility of our conceptualisations 
with the aforementioned two models, despite the different 
literatures surveyed, provides a degree of validation for 
all of them across a range of settings. It provides corrobo-
ration that suggests that our review was sufficiently thor-
ough and in-depth to develop a robust conceptual model.
Strengths and limitations
We sought to ensure the validity of our conceptualisation 
of social isolation and related terms by following an estab-
lished, iterative process for conducting conceptual reviews 
[25] and consulting with external experts. Our review pro-
vides a model with five domains into which all relevant con-
ceptual terms fit well.
Three limitations relate to the scope of the review. First, 
we did not include conceptualisations of how people relate 
to others within the larger social order. Our review synthe-
sised the existing conceptualisations of social isolation and 
related terms at an individual level rather than looking at 
their societal context.
Second, conceptualisations or measures which have not 
been used in mental health settings were outside the scope 
of our review. Concepts and measures potentially relevant 
to, but not used in, the field of mental health may, therefore, 
have been overlooked. The suitability for other population 
groups of reported measures, which have been used and 
validated with mental health populations, remains unclear. 
There are three reasons for focusing on mental health litera-
ture in our review: (1) Loneliness and social isolation are 
of increasing interest in mental health, so there is a large, 
recent literature to draw on. Our a priori assumption has 
been that the same concepts have been found useful as in 
other literature, but we wished to establish that this is the 
case and investigate whether there are any mental health-
specific concepts in use; (2) the literature on social isola-
tion and related concepts is too vast and diffuse to review 
comprehensively across all fields. Valtorta and colleagues 
[18] searched relevant literature in the fields of older adults 
and cardiovascular disease. Our review, therefore, allows a 
comparison with how the concepts are used in mental health; 
(3) A secondary aim of our review is to identify appropri-
ate measures for use with mental health population for the 
concepts that we propose, which are most easily established 
through a focus on the mental health literature, allowing 
identification of measures that have proved feasible and 
acceptable in this population.
Third, social isolation and related terms have been mainly 
conceptualised as relating to a lack of relationships or posi-
tive aspects of the existing relationships. Our review, there-
fore, did not fully explore how negative aspects of relation-
ships have been defined or measured, and we identified few 
scales measuring negative characteristics of relationships. 
When people report “low” social support, their score may 
reflect either the absence of support from others or the pres-
ence of a negative, conflictive relationship [71], but most 
social support scales are not able to distinguish these poten-
tial meanings of low support [72]. An exception is “the 
Close Persons Questionnaire” [57] which includes items 
on three types of support—confiding/emotional support, 
 1459

practical support, and negative aspects of support. Portes 
[35] also proposes the concept of “negative social capital” 
deriving from peer pressures for exclusive in-group bonding, 
or high demands from others. Negative aspects of relation-
ships, such as high expressed emotion or inter-personal fric-
tion, have been shown to be associated with poor outcomes 
in schizophrenia and affective disorders [57, 72–75]. The 
conceptualization and measurement of negative aspects of 
relationships is a fruitful area for a future review.
Two further potential limitations of the review relate to 
the search strategy and procedures. First, the initial elec-
tronic search was only conducted in Web of Science with 
time limits 2013–2015, although further relevant studies 
were identified through review articles and through read-
ing full-text or reference lists of included studies. Before 
this process was concluded, however, we reached a point 
where new conceptual definitions of terms or new meas-
ures were rarely being identified, suggesting that saturation 
of novel information had been reached. Second, screening 
of potentially relevant studies was conducted by a team of 
researchers, with no formal checks of reliability in research-
ers’ selection decisions. To mitigate this, study authors (JW 
and BLE) provided training for all the researchers involved 
in the literature searching and were consulted in the event of 
uncertainty about studies’ relevance.
Implications for research
The boundaries between social isolation and related terms 
are often blurred, although they can be conceptually catego-
rized within a relatively small number of domains. This is 
not solely of academic interest: conceptual clarity can sup-
port intervention development and evaluation. A range of 
interventions may be required to address different problems 
relating to people’s social relationships. Further research is 
also needed to understand which aspects of people’s social 
relations are most important in sustaining good mental 
health or recovering from mental illness. In both cases, pre-
cision about what exactly is being studied and how best to 
measure it is essential.
The need for better evidence regarding the effectiveness 
of social interventions is widely accepted [76, 77]. Our 
review can contribute to this in the area of social isolation 
by helping researchers and intervention developers to spec-
ify expected outcomes of interventions and mechanisms of 
effect more precisely, and measure them appropriately. Con-
ceptual clarity can also help researchers to explore associa-
tions between social relationships and other outcomes, and 
directions of effect, more precisely.
Furthermore, our review identified a gap in the litera-
ture on social isolation and related concepts regarding: 
online social relationships. The concepts and measures of 
social relationships retrieved for our review rarely included 
consideration of online social contact. People with mental 
illness may experience greater social isolation and loneli-
ness compared to the general population [2–4, 11]. How-
ever, they appear to use social media and online networking 
similarly to the general population [78, 79]. It may, there-
fore, be important to assess online contact when considering 
social relations in the field of mental health. A systematic 
review identified limited and primarily qualitative research 
conducted in this area [80]. In studies measuring online 
social networking, researchers either designed or adapted 
the existing questionnaires [81–83], illustrating a lack of 
validated measure of online social relationships. This lack 
has hampered comparisons of results across studies [80]: 
development of such a measure would be a useful focus for 
future research.
In conclusion, our review proposes a conceptual model 
with five categories which fits all concepts relevant to social 
isolation. It can help researchers and practitioners to under-
stand and distinguish these concepts, and how they can best 
be measured in the field of mental health.
