ABSTRACT 
 
Fish-borne cestodes capable of infecting humans are represented almost exclusively by so called broad 
tapeworms, i.e. members of the order Diphyllobothriidea. These large-sized human tapeworms have 
three host life-cycles, in which teleost fishes (except in the case of Spirometra) play a role of the 
second intermediate hosts and represent a source of human infection. Although the broad fish 
tapeworms (genera Adenocephalus, Diphyllobothrium and Diplogonoporus) have been recognized as 
human parasites for a long time, many aspects of their biology and epidemiology, including species 
composition of individual genera, their clinical relevance and geographical distribution have been 
noticeably understudied. The overriding obstacle preventing clarification of the diversity, origin and 
host-associations of diphyllobothriids is the poor state of systematics of the group. Even though 
diphyllobothriosis itself is not a life-threatening disease, it is considered the most important fish-borne 
zoonosis caused by a cestode with up to 20 million people estimated to be infected worldwide, with an

affinity to colder climates including subarctic and arctic areas of the North and partly South 
Hemisphere. Moreover, several species seem to (re-)emerge in the most developed countries. Current 
(re-)emergence of diphyllobothriosis and the introduction of its agents into new geographical regions 
are mainly fuelled by: (i) increased preference of human societies to consume raw food, (ii) globalized 
trade with fish products, (iii) human migration. Dozens of nominal species have been described so far, 
but only 15 species currently recognized as valid have been reported to infect humans. Moreover, the 
validity of species described from Alaska, which have been reported from man (Diphyllobothrium 
alascense, D. dalliae, D. ursi) should be confirmed using molecular data. Yet, we still lack information 
about the intraspecific variability and species boundaries of the most important broad tapeworm species 
including those occurring in cold climates, such as Diphyllobothrium latum, D. dendriticum and D. 
nihonkaiense. Moreover, molecular data indicate paraphyly of the genus Diphyllobothrium, which may 
explain different host associations and morphology of species in distantly related lineages. For the first 
time in the literature, data on all human-infecting broad fish tapeworms, most of which occur in cold 
climates, are summarized, with focus on rare or uncommon species that were largely neglected in the 
literature or appeared in hardly accessible papers. 
 
1. Introduction 
 
1.5. Aim and focus of the present paper 
 
 
Diphyllobothriosis and its causative agents have been reviewed in several outstanding 
publications (e.g., von Bonsdorff, 1977; Dick, 2008; Dick et al., 2001). Recently, Kuchta et al. (2015a) 
and Scholz et al. (2009) summarized the basic information on broad fish tapeworms, with focus on the 
most notoriously known species such as Diphyllobothrium latum, D. nihonkaiense, D. dendriticum and

Adenocephalus pacificus as well as Diplogonoporus balaenopterae (Fig. 1 A–F). In contrast, the 
present paper is focused on rare and infrequent human infecting fish-borne cestodes, most of them 
having been reported from cold climates such as Alaska (USA) and Japan. 
 
1.2. Broad fish tapeworms: brief history, basic characteristics and morphology 
 
 
Tapeworms (Cestoda) of the order Diphyllobothriidea include species that can infect humans 
and cause diphyllobothriosis (or diplogonoporosis) by consuming raw or undercooked fish infected 
with metacestodes (plerocercoids). These cestodes are commonly called broad fish tapeworms and  are 
the causative agents of the most frequent fish-borne human disease caused by cestodes (von Bonsdorff, 
1977; Dick, 2008; Kuchta et al., 2015a; Scholz et al. 2009). The first broad fish tapeworm was 
described already by C. Linnaeus as Taenia lata Linnaeus, 1758 (now recognized as Diphyllobothrium 
latum) from humans and it is by far the most frequent causative agent of diphyllobothriosis (von 
Bonsdorff, 1977; Dick, 2008; Kuchta et al., 2015a). However, human cases were reported long time 
before the formal description of D. latum (see Kuchta et al., 2015a). 
 
Broad fish tapeworms are usually large worms, with the maximum length reaching up to 20 
metres. von Bonsdorff (1964) reported a 42 years old Finnish man infected simultaneously with 16 
specimens with a total length of 333 meters. Their body is composed of a large number of proglottids 
containing one, rarely two, set(s) male and female genital organs within each proglottid (broad 
tapeworms are hermaphroditic as almost all other cestodes; they are capable of self-fertilization, even 
though cross-fertilization is also possible if two specimens mate). The anterior end (scolex) possesses 
paired, usually elongate and shallow attachment organs called bothria. Proglottids are filled with 
numerous vitelline follicles in its cortical layer; the follicles participate in formation of eggs and 
represent supply for developing embryo (oocyte). The tubular uterus usually forms several loops filled

with numerous eggs in the central part of proglottids; the presence of dark eggs is the most striking 
morphological character even in live proglottids. The eggs are shelled, with an operculum on a 
narrower pole and do not contain fully developed embryo (six-hooked oncosphere or hexacanth), which 
is formed after expulsion of the eggs from gravid proglottids to the water. Detailed information on the 
morphology of diphyllobothriidean cestodes including broad fish tapeworms is provided by Andersen 
(1987), Delyamure et al. (1985), Hernández-Orts et al. (2015), Kuchta et al. (2013). 
 
1.3. Life cycles and transmission 
 
 
The first life cycle of diphyllobothriidean cestodes was elucidated by Janicki and Rosen (1917), 
who successfully infected planktonic copepods with coracidia (ciliated larvae containing oncospheres) 
of D. latum from Switzerland. These crustaceans serve as the first intermediate hosts and harbor larvae 
called procercoids in their body cavity. Freshwater fishes such as perch (Perca spp.), pike (Esox), 
pikeperch (Sander) and burbot (Lota) serve as the second intermediate hosts of broad tapeworms; they 
become infected after consuming copepods with procercoids. The definitive hosts also gets infection 
per-orally, i.e. by feeding second intermediate hosts harboring plerocercoids. Life cycles of only a few 
freshwater species have been completed and almost nothing is known about development and 
transmission of marine taxa, which impedes a more effective control of fish products as potential 
source of human infection (Kuchta et al., 2015a). 
 
From the epidemiological point of view, site of infection of plerocercoids in fish body plays a 
key role. Whereas larvae localized in the muscles represent a high risk of human infections, 
plerocercoids localized in the body cavity, stomach wall or on the surface of internal organs are usually 
less important as a source of human infection. Unfortunately, microhabitat of infective larvae of 
numerous species, especially those maturing in marine mammals, is not well known.

1.4. Distribution and endemic regions  
 
Even though diphyllobothriidean cestodes, such as Diphyllobothrium stemmacephalum and 
Diplogonoporus balanopterae, may have a nearly cosmopolitan distribution, most species occur in cold 
climates.  However, areas with diphyllobothriosis are unevenly distributed on the globe, depending 
principally on eating habits of human population in individual regions. Over the last few decades, the 
number of human cases has declined dramatically in historical endemic areas such as Baltic countries 
and Finland, the River Danube delta, Russia (Karelia), Canada and northern USA (Great Lakes). In 
contrast, new cases have re-appeared in subalpine lakes, which were considered free of infection for 
decades (Dupouy-Camet and Peduzzi, 2004). A number of imported cases of „exotic‟ cestodes, such as 
the Pacific seal tapeworm (Adenocephalus pacificus) in Europe and Diphyllobothrium nihonkaiense in 
Europe, western and eastern USA (California, North Carolina), China (Shanghai) and New Zealand 
have recently been confirmed using molecular markers (Kuchta et al., 2015a). Application of molecular 
tools, including Multiplex-PCR, has also enabled us to reliably identify causative agents of human 
infection to the species level, which has changed our understanding of the actual distribution areas of 
several human-infecting species and documented (re)-emergence of some of them (see, e.g. Kuchta et 
al., 2013, 2015a,b; Wicht et al. 2010). 
 
1.5. Human disease: diagnostics, treatment and control 
 
 
Diagnosis of human cases is usually based on the presence of operculate eggs or expelled parts 
of the strobila (chains of proglottids) in stool samples. The shape of proglottids and the median position 
of gonopores make their identification from other human tapeworms easy (proglottids of Taenia spp.

have a different shape and the cirrus and vaginal pore are lateral). The eggs of diphyllobothriidean 
cestodes are relatively small and possess an operculum, thus superficially resembling those of some 
trematodes (Digenea). However, morphology-based identification of clinical samples to the species 
level is possible, mainly in the case of A. pacificus whose eggs are smaller than those of species of 
Diphyllobothrium and Diplogonoporus (see Hernández-Orts et al., 2015; Leštinová et al., 2016). In 
fact, reliable species identification of proglottids and eggs of most broad tapeworms is possible only 
using molecular tools, especially cox1 gene sequences (Kuchta et al., 2015a). 
 
Treatment of infected patients is straightforward and a single dose of anthelminthic drug such as 
praziquantel is usually sufficient to expel cestodes from infected persons. The most effective and 
simple preventive measure to control the disease is avoiding consumption of raw fish, i.e. to eat fish 
that have been boiled, cooked or frozen before consuming (Kuchta et al., 2015a; Scholz et al., 2009). 
 
 
2. Species capable of infecting humans 
 
2.1. Notoriously known species 
 
 
Out of 15 species of human-infecting diphyllobothriidean tapeworms, just four have been 
treated in detail in recent papers and reviews, namely D. latum, D. nihonkaiense, D. dendriticum and A. 
pacificus (see, e.g., Dick, 2008; Kuchta et al., 2015a, b; Scholz et al., 2009). Therefore, only basic 
information about these notoriously known human-infecting species are provided herein; first 
intermediate hosts (always copepods of known life cycles) are not mentioned below.

Definitive hosts (hosts to be verified marked with question mark): humans (type host), domestic 
dog, wild canids and felids (Alopex lagopus, Canis latrans (?), C. lupus, Felis euptilura, F. silvestris, 
Lynx lynx (?), Nyctereutes procyonoides, Vulpes vulpes), bears (?) (Ursus arctos, U. americanus), 
raccoons (?) (Procyon lotor), weasels (?) (Gulo gulo, Lutra lutra, Martes martes, Martes zibellina, 
Meles meles, Neovison vison), domestic cat (?), pig (?). Adults were obtained from experimentally 
infected golden hamster (Mesocricetus auratus). 
 
Human infections: Estimates of a total of 10–20 million cases worldwide. 
 
Second intermediate hosts: freshwater fishes, mainly pike (Esox lucius), perch (Perca 
fluviatilis), and burbot (Lota lota), less frequently ruff (Gymnocephalus cernuus), pikeperch (Sander 
vitreum), and yellow perch (Perca flavescens). In South America, naturalized wild and cultured 
salmonids  such as rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) have been reported as intermediate hosts of 
D. latum but these hosts need verification (Dick et al., 2001; Kuchta et al. 2015a).  
 
Site of infection of plerocercoids: mostly free in the musculature. 
 
Distribution: North America (Canada – Manitoba, Saskatchewan, the forested lakes of Ontario, 
Alberta, and USA – Lake Superior)) and Euro-Siberian bioregion (Scandinavia, Alpine lakes, River 
Danube basin, Russia).

Remarks: This is the most frequent human fish-borne cestode, even though cases reported as D. 
latum from Japan and Korea, as well as many records from North America, were misidentified and 
belonged to other species, in particular D. nihonkaiense (see Choi et al., 2015; Kuchta et al., 2015a;

Yamane et al., 1986). Records of D. latum from South America need confirmation. Three cases from 
humans have been confirmed from Chile, but they may represent imported cases (Mercado et al., 
2010). Pigs may be unnatural hosts of D. latum. Given the possibility that reports of „D. latum‟ in felids 
has been confused with the related Spirometra, and given that cats are common hosts of S. mansoni, the 
report of D. latum in cats is highly suspect.

Remarks: The Japanese broad fish tapeworm is the second most frequent fish-borne cestode, 
even though almost all human cases of diphyllobothriosis in Japan were assigned to D. latum, but 
Kamo (1978) proposed to reconsider the taxonomic status of human-infecting tapeworms designated as 
D. latum. In 1986, Yamane et al. demonstrated morphological differences between D. latum from 
Finland and cestodes from Japan, for which they proposed a new species, D. nihonkaiense. Subsequent 
biochemical and genetic studies confirmed separate status of this Japanese species that has salmonid 
intermediate hosts, which further distinguishes it from D. latum (Arizono et al., 2009; Choi et al., 2015; 
Wicht et al., 2008a).  
 
Diphyllobothrium klebanovskii was described from the lower Amur River basin in the Russian 
Far East (Muratov and Posokhov, 1988), but its synonymy with D. nihonkaiense was evidenced by 
Arizono et al. (2009). Dovgalev and Valovaya (1996) tentatively considered D. giljacicum, D. luxi (= 
probably synonym of Adenocephalus pacificus – see below) and D. nihonkaiense to be conspecific, but 
they did not provide any evidence.  
 
For long time, all human cases were limited to Japan (more than 1700 cases in total – Yamane 
and Shiwaku, 2003; Yamasaki, 2012), but the tapeworm has recently been reported also from Korea (a 
total of 50 reported cases, with 36 samples sequenced – Choi et al., 2015), China and the Pacific coast 
of North America, i.e. Canada (British Columbia) and North-West USA. Imported cases of 
diphyllobothriosis caused by D. nihonkaiense have been recently confirmed in Europe (Czech 
Republic, France, Switzerland), USA (California, North Carolina, Pennsylvania), Asia (China) and 
Oceania (Hawaii, New Zealand) (see references above). Muratov (1990) reviewed human cases caused 
by D. klebanovskii (= D. nihonkaiense) in the Russian Far East.

oblongatum Thomas, 1946; D. medium Fahmy, 1954; D. microcordiceps Szidat et Soria, 1957; D. 
norvegicum Vik, 1957. 
 
Definitive hosts: This cestode is a euryxenous parasite of birds and mammals. It has been found 
in 30 species of fish-eating birds from 9 families (Accipitridae, Alcidae, Corvidae, Gaviidae, Laridae, 
Pandionidae, Pelecanidae, Podicipedidae, and Sternidae), with the majority of the records from gulls 
(Laridae) [type host Larus tridactylus]. However, adults of D. dendriticum have been found also in 
mammals, mainly canids (foxes Alopex lagopus and Vulpes vulpes, domestic dog Canis familiaris) as 
well as in bears (grizzly Ursus arctos) and probably also in otters (Lutra lutra). Golden hamster 
(Mesocricetus auratus), golden mouse (Ochrotomys nuttalli) and rat (Rattus norvegicus) were proved 
to serve as suitable experimental hosts. Cestodes identified as D. dendriticum were also found once in 
Hydromys chrysogaster (Muridae) from Tasmania, but this record needs verification (Kuchta et al. 
2013). Records of D. dendriticum from seals (Pusa sibirica, Phoca hispida) represent only accidental 
infections with plerocercoids (Kuchta and Scholz, 2016). 
 
Human infections: about 1000 cases, most from the Lake Baikal region and Arctic and 
Subarctic North America (see Kuchta et al., 2013 for more data). 
 
Second intermediate hosts: Plerocercoids have been reported from more than 50 species of 12 
families of freshwater fish, but the principal hosts are salmonids including whitefish (Coregonus spp.) 
(Salmoniformes: Salmonidae). 
 
Site of infection of plerocercoids: free (or encysted) in the viscera and body cavity, only rarely 
muscles.

Distribution: Holarctic (partly overlaps with D. latum, but D. dendriticum has a wider 
distribution, perhaps because of its bird definitive hosts; it tends to predominate in Arctic regions, but it 
is also found farther south than D. latum, in Wyoming, Montana, Great Lakes, etc.) and Patagonia 
(Argentina and Chile).  
 
Selected references: Andersen et al. (1978); von Bonsdorff (1977); Chizhova and Gofman-
Kadoshnikov (1968); Freeman and Jamieson (1972); Kuchta et al. (2013, 2015a); Leikina (1969); 
Rausch and Hilliard (1970); Vik (1957); Wicht et al. (2008b). 
 
Remarks: D. dendriticum is the fourth most frequent causative agent of diphyllobothriosis in 
humans. Most of human cases have been reported from Lake Baikal area – Buryatia and Irkutsk 
(prevalence almost 30% in 1929 with around new 600 cases per year, but now just around 0.01%) and 
other parts of Siberia (Taymyr Peninsula, Nenetsia, Sverdlovsk, Tyumen, Yakutia, Yamalia). Only 
around 10 cases have been confirmed from the Arctic North America (Alaska, Nunavut and British 
Columbia), mostly from native Inuit populations.  
 
Even though D. dendriticum is widely distributed in northern Europe, no autochthonous cases 
have been reported with the exception of few experimental self-infections in Norway and Finland (Vik 
1957 – he infected himself 11 times; Bylund and Wikgren 1968 – 3 cases). There are 3 imported cases 
from the Czech Republic Switzerland (one patient seems to have become infected in Alaska) (Kuchta 
et al., 2013; Wicht et al., 2008b). Several volunteers infected themselves successfully by plerocercoids 
in Russia (Lake Baikal), USA (Maine) and Canada (Northwest Territories) (Andersen et al., 1987; 
Chizhova and Gofman-Kadoshnikov, 1968; Freeman and Jamieson, 1972), whereas other experimental 
infections of humans with D. dentriticum failed (Rausch and Hilliard, 1970).  
 
This cestode has been previously neglected as a human parasite but recent data indicate that it 
may be relatively frequent (Kuchta et al., 2013).

Definitive hosts: 9 species of fur seals and sea lions (Pinnipedia: Otariidae), including Juan 
Fernández fur seal Arctocephalus philippii (misidentified as A. australis) (type host); accidental hosts: 
domestic dog (Canis familiaris) and black-backed jackal (Canis mesomelas). 
 
Human infections: nearly 1,000 cases, with great majority in Peru, rarely in Chile and Equador, 
6 cases in Japan, 10 cases probably in the Sakhalin Island, Russia, and 5 in Spain. 
 
Second intermediate hosts: plerocercoids were found in 21 species of marine fishes of 12 
families including 1 shark (for details, see Kuchta et al., 2015b). 
 
Site of infection of plerocercoids: encysted in the body cavity and on the surface of internal 
organs (see Kuchta et al., 2015b). 
 
Distribution: Cosmopolitan (Arctic and Temperate North Pacific, Southern Ocean and 
Temperate South America, Temperate South Africa and Australia). However, the human cases have 
been reported almost exclusively from the Pacific coast of South America. 
 
Selected references: Baer et al. (1967); Hernández-Orts et al. (2015); Kuchta et al. (2014, 
2015b); Pastor-Valle et al. (2014). 
 
Remarks: This species has been recently redescribed by Hernández-Orts et al. (2015) who also 
proposed resurrection of the genus Adenocephalus Nybelin, 1931, with A. pacificus as its type and only 
species, based on molecular data and unique morphological traits. Kuchta et al. (2015b) reviewed 
available literary data on human cases and provided information about geographical distribution of the

parasite in human population and revised the spectrum of second intermediate hosts. Even though the 
great majority of human cases is limited to Peru, there are some, yet still occasional, cases of infection 
from Ecuador and Chile and outside South America with six cases in Japan, but without molecular 
evidence.  
 
Marine fishes are the source of human infection, but their precise species composition and 
distribution are insufficiently known (Kuchta et al., 2015b). Recently, 4 human cases have been 
reported from Spain (Kuchta et al, 2014; Pastor-Valle et al., 2014), but their origin remains unknown. 
Import of marine fishes from endemic areas in South America on ice, i.e. not frozen, may have 
represented the source of human infections in Europe. 
 
Rutkevich (1937) described Diphyllobothrium luxi from 10 natives at the Sakhalin Island, 
Russia, but this species is most probably conspecific with A. pacificus (see Kuchta et al., 2015b).  
 
2.2. Neglected and/or poorly known human-infecting species 
 
 
The validity of some of the species listed below requires confirmation but material suitable for 
genotyping is usually missing. Most of them are confined in their geographical distribution to cold or 
temperate climates. The key role in detecting broad fish tapeworms in humans and unravelling their 
species diversity and biology was played byR. L. Rausch in Alaska (see below for references to his 
pivotal papers). In Japan, a similarly important role was played by H. Kamo (see references below).  
 
2.2.1. Diphyllobothrium alascense Rausch et Williamson, 1958 
 
Definitive hosts: domestic dog (Canis familiaris) (type host), humans (?). 
 
Human infections: only one doubtful record. 
 
Second intermediate hosts: burbot (Lota lota), boreal smelt (Osmerus mordax).

Site of infection of plerocercoids: lumen of the stomach. 
 
Distribution: North America (western Alaska). 
 
Selected references: Adams and Rausch (1997); Hilliard (1960, 1972); Rausch and Adams 
(2000); Rausch and Hilliard (1970); Rausch and Williamson (1958); Rausch et al. (1967). 
 
Remarks: This species was described from tapeworms found in 10 sled-dogs at the village of 
Chevak in the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta by Rausch and Williamson (1958) and later also reported from 
the Hooper Bay by Rausch et al. (1967). Prevalence of infection was 13%, maximum intensity of 
infection was 109 tapeworms, but only 19 were mature (Rausch and Adams, 2000). This cestode was 
„tentatively‟ identified as D. alascence by Rausch et al. (1967) in clinical sample from a man after 
anthelminthic treatment.  
 
According to Rausch and Adams (2000), D. alascense most closely resembles in its 
morphology D. cordatum, a cestode of pinnipeds, especially common in the bearded seal, Erignathus 
barbatus, in northern seas (see below). Records from harbor seal in Levelock (Kvichak River) by 
Dailey and Fallace (1989), Margolis and Dailey (1972) and Rausch and Hilliard (1970) thus seem to 
have been misidentified (Rausch and Adams, 2000).  
 
Plerocercoids are small-sized (length 0.7–1.5 mm) and are located only in the lumen of the 
stomach of burbot and boreal smelt; dogs are readily infected after consuming burbot. Overall 
prevalence in burbot was higher than 50% (Rausch and Adams, 2000). The eggs have a thick, pitted 
shell and the coracidium is able to survive even in seawater (Hilliard, 1960).

Site of infection of plerocercoids: unknown. 
 
Distribution: Pacific Ocean (endemic to Hawaii). 
 
Selected references: Andersen (1987); Kamo et al. (1982, 1986); Rausch (1969). 
 
Remarks: This species was described from the endemic Hawaiian monk seal in Hawaii and has 
been reported only by Andersen (1987) since its original description except for a doubtful record from 
a man in Japan. Kamo et al. (1982) identified tapeworms expelled from a 57 years old Japanese seaman 
as D. cameroni but this identification based only on proglottids needs verification because of some 
discrepancies between these cestodes and those of D. cameroni in morphometric characteristics such as 
diameters of the seminal vesicle and the size of the eggs. Kamo et al. (1986) reported cestodes from 
other Japanese seamen and identified one them as D. cameroni, even though its internal anatomy 
resembled more that of the morphologically similar D. hians (see Andersen, 1987). Maejima et al. 
(1989, 1991) re-studied these cestodes from Japanese seamen, with focus on their egg morphology and 
excretory system.  
 
Since there is not any convincing evidence that D. cameroni can actually infect humans, it 
should not be considered as a human parasite. 
 
2.2.3. Diphyllobothrium cordatum (Leuckart, 1863) Meggitt, 1924 
 
Definitive hosts: bearded seal (Erignathus barbatus), harp seal (Pagophilus groenlandicus), 
harbor seal (Phoca vitulina), probably also walrus (Odobenus rosmarus); occasionally domestic dog 
(Canis familiaris). A woman harbored adult tapeworms and was listed first in the original description; 
it is thus considered as a type species (see Remarks). 
 
Human infections: only human case was reported by Leuckart (1863) and some supposedly 
caused by D. cordatum reported by Kolpakova (1933; cited in Verhinskii, 1964) and Rausch et al. 
(1967).

Selected references: Andersen (1987); Delyamure et al. (1985); Kolpakova (1933), Leuckart 
(1863); Rausch (2005); Rausch and Adams (2000); Rausch et al. (1967). 
 
Remarks: The only reliable human record of D. cordatum is that of Leuckart (1863) from 
western Greenland (70°N). He described a tapeworm voided from a woman in Godhavn (North 
Greenland) during her fifth pregnancy. Leuckart‟s (1863) description of D. cordatum seems to have 
been based on material of two species, i.e. a single fully mature cestode from a Greenland woman and 
about 20 much smaller, not fully mature specimens of different morphology from 5 dogs, all collected 
at Godhavn, in western Greenland. 
 
Kolpakova (1933) reported frequent occurrence (prevalence 41–64%) of broad tapeworms 
identified as D. latum and D. cordatum in Sacha Region (Yakutia, Russia), with the maximum intensity 
of infection as many as 256 cestodes. Rausch et al. (1967) found scolices of tapeworms possibly 
belonging to D. cordatum in a man (lower Kuskokwim River, Alaska), but this record was not 
mentioned in Rausch‟s later paper re-describing D. cordatum – see Rausch (2005). This identification 
thus needs verification. 
 
2.2.4. Diphyllobothrium dalliae Rausch, 1956

Site of infection of plerocercoids: free in the body cavity. 
 
Distribution: North America (Western Alaska – St. Matthew Island, St. Lawrence Island, 
Chevak, Mt. Village, Tanunak), northeastern Siberia (Lavrentiya Bay, Chukotsk Peninsula). 
 
Selected references: Hilliard (1959, 1960); Rausch (1956), Rausch and Hilliard (1970); Rausch 
and Williamson (1958); Rausch et al. (1967); Zhukov (1963). 
 
Remarks: Rausch and Hilliard (1970) considered this species to be a relatively common parasite 
of humans, dog, Arctic fox and gulls in the western Alaska, where Alaska blackfish was frequently 
eaten raw by the Eskimos (Yupiks). According to Rausch et al. (1967), it was probably the most 
frequent diphyllobothriid in sled-dogs from Alaska, which were fed upon blackfish in winter (). It was 
also found in Arctic fox from the St. Matthew and St. Lawrence Islands. Plerocercoids, but no adults, 
were recorded in eastern Siberia (Zhukov, 1963).  
 
The plerocercoids of D. dalliae are resistant to cold and may survive for 24 hours at -6 °C in a 
blackfish averaging 17 g (Hilliard, 1959). Morphology of the eggs and coracidia were studied in detail 
by Hilliard (1960). The prevalence in fish intermediate hosts around the type locality was up to 84% 
(45 blackfish examined), with mean intensity of 3.7 plerocercoids per fish. Zhukov (1963) reported 
prevalence 90% in D. pectoralis and 6% in S. malma from Lavrentiya Bay in the Chukotsk Peninsula 
(Russia). In contrast, examination of blackfish from other areas in Alaska such as Hooper Bay (Rausch 
and Williamson, 1958) or Anchorage (24 specimens from 4 lakes examined by the junior author) were 
unsuccessful. 
 
 
2.2.5. Diphyllobothrium elegans (Krabbe, 1865) Meggitt, 1924

Selected references: Andersen (1987); Delyamure et al. (1985); Kamo (1999); Kamo et al. 
(1986). 
 
Remarks: This species was originally described from hooded seal in Greenland and later 
reported from several other hosts and regions, but these records need verification. The only human case 
was reported by Kamo et al. (1986) from a Japanese seaman, but tapeworms expelled from this patient 
were identified as D. elegans only tentatively. Interestingly, the same author (Kamo, 1999) and 
Yamane and Shiwaku (2003) did not list this species among human parasites in the reviews of human 
diphyllobothriids. It remains questionable whether this species is capable of infecting humans, but is 
included here for completeness. 
 
2.2.6. Diphyllobothrium hians (Diesing, 1850) Meggitt, 1924 
 
Definitive hosts: Mediterranean monk seal (Monachus monachus) [type host]; reported also 
from the hooded seal (Cystophora cristata) (?), bearded seal (Erignathus barbatus) (?), ringed seal 
(Pusa hispida) (?) and harbor seal (Phoca vitulina) (?).

Site of infection of plerocercoids: unknown. 
 
Distribution: Mediterranean and circumboreal. 
 
References: Kamo et al. (1986, 1988a), Yamane and Shiwaku (2003).

several other seals from the Arctic and Subarctic coast of Europe (Andersen, 1987; Delyamure et al.,

1985; Markowski, 1952a). However, these identifications from other than type hosts are doubtful 
because these specimens differ in their morphology from that of the type material of Diesing (1850).  
 
Kamo et al. (1986) reported tapeworms tentatively identified as D. hians from a 27 years old 
Japanese seaman. The same authors reported the “first” case of D. hians from 29 years old Japanese 
seaman based on re-description of D. hians by Markowski (1952a). The latter case is considered to 
represent the only reliable record of this cestode (Kamo, 1999; Scholz et al., 2009; Yamane and 
Shiwaku, 2003), but verification of species identification is pending. 
 
2.2.7. Diphyllobothrium lanceolatum (Krabbe, 1865) Meggitt, 1924 
 
Definitive hosts: bearded seal (Erignathus barbatus) [type host], ribbon seal (Histriophoca 
fasciata), harp seal (Pagophilus groenlandicus), ringed seal (Pusa hispida), harbor seal (Phoca 
vitulina); reported also from the Mediterranean monk seal (Monachus monachus) (?); occasionally in 
domestic dog (Canis familiaris). 
 
Human infections: only a single plerocercoid found in man. 
 
Second intermediate host: sardine cisco (Coregonus sardinella). 
 
Site of infection of plerocercoids: free in the body cavity.

Remarks: This species was described by Krabbe (1865) from bearded seal in Greenland and it is 
easily distinguishable from all but one (D. schistochilos Germanos, 1895) species of the genus by 
lanceolate shape of the body. Diphyllobothrium schistochilos is much smaller and has a restricted 
distribution area (occurs only in the European part of the Arctic – Maltsev, 1998).

The only human case, which is quite doubtful and needs verification, was reported by Rausch 
and Hilliard (1970). These authors found D. lanceolatum in 7 dogs from the Hooper Bay and Kotzebue 
and assumed this cestode may be capable of developing also in humans. In the same study, they found 
three well-developed strobilae of D. dalliae and 52 plerocercoids and early-stage strobilae of 
diphyllobothriids, among which was a single plerocercoid identified as D. lanceolatum, in a resident of 
Chevak after his treatment with quinacrine. Rausch and Hilliard (1970) also reported plerocercoids of 
D. lanceolatum from the body cavity of a whitefish, Coregonus sardinella, from a brackish lagoon near 
Point Barrow, Alaska. 
 
Considering that the only human infection assigned to D. lanceolatum is uncertain, and it was 
represented only by a plerocercoid rather than a strobilate tapeworm, this species should no longer be 
listed as a human parasite. 
 
2.2.8. Diphyllobothrium orcini Hatsushika et Shirouzu, 1990

Remarks: This species was described from a killer whale collected from the Kii Peninsula, 
Honshu, Japan by Hatsushiuka and Shirouzu (1990). Two years later, Nakazawa et al. (1992) reported 
one strobila without scolex assigned to D. orcini expelled from 39 years old man from Yokohama in 
Japan. The second human case was reported by Kifune et al. (2000) from 25 years old man from

Kasuga in Japan. Diphyllobothrium orcini is morphologically similar to D. polyrugosum Delyamure 
and Skriabin, 1966 described also from killer whale in Russia, but molecular data that would confirm 
separate status of both species are not available.

References: Fukumoto et al. (1988); Markowski (1952b); Yurakhno and Maltsev (1994).  
 
Remarks: The only human case was reported from a 30 year old Japanese seaman from 
Fukuoka Prefecture in Japan after his treatment with bithionol. The specimen expelled was without 
scolex, but the presence of the terminal part of the uterus forming a thick-walled pocket filled with eggs 
indicated that it was D. scoticum. The patient reported eating  raw euphausiid crustaceans on the 
voyage to the Antarctic Ocean, but his infection with procercoids (first-stage larva – see Chervy, 2002) 
from the first intermediate host is doubtful. Eating of raw fish, not admitted explicitly by this patient, 
seems to be a more plausible explanation of his apparently accidental infection in the Antarctic.

(2016).  
 
Remarks: Cobbold (1858) described this species from harbor porpoise off Scotland as the type 
species of his new genus Diphyllobothrium. The first human case caused by this species, but assigned 
to D. latum, was reported in 1965 from 29 years old Japanese in Okinawa, Japan (Sunagawa et al. 
1965). Cestodes were reported as “the abnormal proglottids of Diphyllobothrium latum with a single or 
double sets of reproductive organs” by Koga and Iwata (1976), but Kamo et al. (1977) suggested the 
presence of a new species of diphyllobothriid expelled from humans tentatively named „Koga-Okamura 
type‟. These cestodes were then described as Diphyllobothrium yonagoense by Yamane et al. (1981). 
 
However, Andersen (1987) synonymized D. yonagoense with D. stemmacephalum based on a 
morphological study of both species. So far, 23 human cases have been reported from Japan (mainly 
from the Honshu and Kyushu Islands) and one case from South Korea (Lee et al., 1988). All but 2 
cases were detected after expulsion of tapeworms from patients and human infections were generally 
asymptomatic.

Rausch (1954); Rausch and Hilliard (1970); Yamasaki et al. (2012a). 
 
Remarks: This species is a common parasite of bears in the northern part of North America. 
This large cestode (up to 11 m long) differs from D. latum in having a larger, more massive scolex 
(Rausch, 1954). Plerocercoids of D. ursi are well adapted to low temperatures and survived longer at -
12°C than the remaining 10 tested species of Diphyllobothrium in experiments of Hilliard (1959). 
 
According to Rausch and Hilliard (1970), D. ursi may be a junior synonym of D. gondo 
Yamaguti, 1942, but detailed comparison of both species that would include molecular data is 
necessary. Andersen et al. (1987) synonymized D. ursi with D. dendriticum and Yamasaki et al. 
(2012a), who sequenced samples of holotype and paratype of D. ursi, found that D. ursi is most closely 
related to this species. In another molecular phylogenetic analysis based on cox1 sequences, Chilean 
isolates identified as D. dendriticum formed a distinct lineage with D. ursi apart from the remaining 
representatives of D. dendriticum (see Kuchta et al., 2013). However, it was not possible to provide 
convincing evidence that tapeworms from Chile were in fact misdiagnosed D. ursi or that D. ursi 
represents a large form of D. dendriticum from bears.

Remarks: Lönnberg (1892) described Diplogonoporus balaenopterae from sei whale in Norway 
and proposed a new genus, Diplogonoporus, to accommodate this new species. Just two years later, 
Ijima and Kurimoto (1894) reported tapeworms identified as Bothriocephalus sp. from 28 years old 
Japanese in Nagasaki Prefecture, Japan. This is in fact the first reported human case of 
diplogonoporiosis caused by D. balaenopterae. However, Blanchard (1894) described these cestodes as 
a new species Krabbea grandis of a new genus, Krabbea Blanchard, 1894. Additional species, which is 
apparently conspecific with D. balaenopterae, was described from a Japanese man as Diplogonoporus 
fukuokaensis Kamo and Miyazaki, 1970.  
 
The life cycle of D. balaenopterae is partly known. Kamo et al. (1972, 1973) experimentally 
infected copepods (Oithona nana) and fish (ony in Japanese). Japanese anchovy, Japanese sardine and

skipjack tuna are suspected to be the most likely sources of infection in humans (Kino et al. 2002; 
Kuchta et al. 2015a). 
 
Using molecular markers, Arizono et al. (2008) and Yamasaki et al. (2012b) provided evidence 
that tapeworms from whales and humans are conspecific. Until now, a total of nearly 300 human cases 
of diplogonoporiosis have been reported, which great majority of reports from Japan, where it is the 
second most common fish-borne cestode after D. nihonkaiense, with about 11% of reported cases of 
human infections caused by broad fish tapeworms (Yamane and Shiwaku, 2003; Yamasaki, 2012). In 
1996, as many as 46 cases have been reported only from Shizuoka Prefecture (Kino et al., 2002). Since 
most human cases were diagnosed in June and July, juvenile Japanese anchovy captured in spring and 
eaten raw is assumed to have been source of human infection (Kino et al., 2002). 
 
Only a very few records of diplogonoporiosis are known out of Japan, with 4 cases in Spain 
(Clavel et al., 1997; Pastor-Valle et al., 2014), 1 case from a Chilean seaman (Wilhelm, 1958) and 1 
from Korea (Chung et al., 1995). The cestode has been reported twice from dogs in Chile and Alaska 
(Rausch, 1964; Wilhelm, 1958), but diplogonoporic tapeworms from seal, otters and mink represent 
another species of the genus, D. tetrapterus (von Siebold, 1848), which has not been found in humans 
(Kuzmina et al., 2015; Rausch, 1964). The complete mitochondrial genome of D. balaenopterae is 
available (Yamasaki et al., 2012).

Remarks: Leon (1907, 1908, 1910) described two unusual diphyllobothriid plerocercoids found 
in men from Romania. One with doubled genital organs as Diplogonoporus brauni Leon, 1907 reported 
2 times and the second with single organs in every proglottid as Braunia jassyensis Leon, 1908. Joyeux 
and Baer (1929), who critically examined rare species of human tapeworms, considered D. brauni to 
represent merely a plerocercoid of the genus Digramma Cholodkovsky, 1914 (= syn. of Ligula – see 
Kuchta et al., 2008) and Dubinina (1980) considered B. jassyensis as a synonym of Ligula intestinalis. 
Both findings represent unusual, probably accidental records of parasites of fish-eating birds in 
humans. 
 
Using molecular markers including microsatellites, Bouzid et al. (2008) and Štefka et al. (2009) 
demonstrated the existence of several lineages of ligulid tapeworms, which most probably represent 
separate species differing from each other in the spectrum of fish intermediate hosts and geographical 
distribution. They also supported invalidation of Digramma proposed by Kuchta et al. (2008), because 
its type species, D. interrupta, appeared among several lineages of the L. intestinalis species complex. 
 
Since both human cases reported one century ago from Romania were apparently represented 
by plerocercoids, i.e. larval stages, and not by sexually mature cestodes, species of Ligula should not be 
considered as human parasites.

seals; several marine fishes serve as second intermediate hosts (Delyamure et al., 1985; Rausch and 
Adams, 2000). Pyramicocephalus phocarum appeared repeatedly in the checklists of human parasites 
(Asford and Crewe, 2003; Coombs and Crompton, 1991) and humans were also listed among its 
definitive hosts in the literature (Delyamure et al., 1985; Schmidt, 1986). However, the present authors 
were unable to find any reliable report of this seal tapeworm from humans. Moreover, Rausch et al. 
(1967) and Rausch and Adams (2000) reported unsuccessful attempts to infect two human volunteers 
with plerocercoids from burbot, which can migrate to the sea. Since there is no convincing evidence 
that this cestode can infect human beings, it is not considered as a potential human parasite by the 
present authors.

Definitive hosts: fish-eating birds (Laridae, Sternidae, Mergus, Bucephala, Ciconiiformes, 
Podicipedidae, Alcidae, Procellariformes); birds of other groups such as Charadridae and corvids can 
swallow individual plerocercoids which have left the body cavity of sticklebacks and thus become 
infected.  
 
Human infections: 2 cases from Alaska. 
 
Second intermediate host: three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus). 
 
Site of infection of plerocercoids: body cavity. 
 
Distribution: northern part of the Holarctic region, especially near sea coast. 
 
Selected references: Dubinina (1980); Rausch et al. (1967). 
 
Remarks: Similarly as species of Ligula, adults of the genus Schistocephalus Creplin, 1829 
exhibit very low host specificity at the level of the definitive host. This species has been reported from 
as many as 42 species of birds of 8 orders (Vik, 1954); adults spend a very short time (several days 
only) in the definitive host, because their plerocercoids almost reach sexual maturity in the second 
intermediate host and definitive host is only needed for production of eggs and oviposition (Dubinina, 
1980). 
  
This species has been reported twice from men in Chevak, Alaska (Rausch et al., 1967), but 
both cases seem to have represented accidental infection with plerocercoids. Therefore, this cestode is 
not considered to be a true human-infecting species. 
 
 
3. Discussion 
 
3.1. Gaps and challenges 
 
Even though broad fish tapeworms are known for a long time, there are considerable gaps in 
our knowledge of numerous aspects of their biology, epidemiology and distribution. Some of the 
 ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
29 
 
obstacles that complicate a more effective control of the human disease caused by these large-sized 
tapeworms are briefly discussed below. 
 
Species delimitation is a key requirement for a reliable identification, which is considerably 
complicated by quite uniform morphology of most diphyllobothriidean cestodes, especially proglottids 
and their internal organs. A high degree of intraspecific, often host-related variability of many taxa also 
makes definition of species boundaries difficult or virtually impossible. As a result, the actual species 
diversity of broad fish tapeworms is corroborated insufficiently. 
 
Problems with species delimitation based on morphological characteristics have also resulted in 
the high number of doubtful records that should be verified using molecular tools if ethanol-fixed 
material is available. This is valid for numerous records of human infections including several rare 
species that normally occur in marine (whales, seals) or terrestrial (bears) mammals. 
  
Interestingly, many doubtful records from humans (e.g., D. cameroni, D. elegans or D. hians) 
are from Japanese seamen almost exclusively from the Kyushu Island in Japan (Tables 1, 2). One of 
just two records of D. orcini is also from Kyushu, whereas the other from Honshu. It is obvious that 
great popularity of eating raw or undercooked fish and their products in Japan considerably contributes 
to an extraordinarily high number of human infections with fish-borne parasites including broad fish 
tapeworms in this country. 
 
Due to insufficiently resolved systematics, i.e. uncertainties in species delimitation and validity 
of individual taxa, it is also impossible to provide reliable data on the spectrum of definitive hosts and 
geographical distribution of individual cestode species. A big challenge represents unravelling the 
origin of South American (Chilean) populations of broad fish tapeworms, because they probably 
colonized native and imported fish hosts quite recently (Torres et al. 2012; Kuchta et al. 2013). 
 
It is acknowledged that diagnosis of human cases is generally easy and straightforward as is 
treatment of patients. However, control of this fish-borne parasitosis is generally not effective enough, 
 ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
30 
 
partly because of our limited knowledge of life cycles of most species, their transmission patterns and 
actual distribution. 
 
3.2. Opportunities 
 
 
Steadily increasing popularity of consumption of raw or poorly cooked fish represents a 
challenge in our effort to control fish-borne diseases globally. (Re)-emergence of diphyllobothriosis in 
some regions, including those with good medical care and high hygienic standards, demonstrates that 
this human disease is not directly related to poverty or poor socio-economic conditions as it is the case 
of many other parasitic diseases.  
 
Considerable progress has been achieved thanks to methods of molecular taxonomy, i.e. 
application of genetic (molecular) markers in genotyping clinical samples. At present, genetic 
characterization of tapeworms from human infections as well as from non-human hosts is inevitable to 
obtain reliable information about species identity, which helps overcome obstacles caused by 
problematic morphology-based identification as discussed above. 
 
International collaborative effort is another important opportunity to advance our understanding 
of the biology and epidemiology of broad fish tapeworms. Such a collaborative effort is necessary to 
facilitate future studies on the epidemiology, life cycles, distribution and host-associations of the 
causative agents of human diphyllobothriosis and related diseases.  
 
Complex life-cycles of broad fish tapeworms are completed in aquatic environment and thus are 
largely controlled by numerous abiotic factors related to temperature and water quality. The present 
climate change thus represents another opportunity to assess its impact on the life cycles of these 
parasites, their transmission and distribution, especially in temperate and cold climates.

3.3. Limitations and obstacles 
 
Broad fish tapeworms are well known causative agents of human disease, but our knowledge of 
their biology and epidemiology is still insufficient due to several limitations and obstacles. One of the 
major obstacles to get deeper knowledge of broad fish tapeworms is the fact that this disease, which is 
actually not life-threatening, attracts little attention from physicians (Kuchta et al., 2015a). Since 
clinical signs of diphyllobothriosis are usually mild, only little attention is paid to proper fixation of 
samples and species identification in diagnostic laboratories. Especially improper processing of clinical 
samples, which are usually fixed with formalin or AFA (= a mixture of acetic acid, formalin and 
ethanol), is a serious obstacle that impedes molecular characterisation of samples, which is in fact the 
only way how to identify reliably proglottids and eggs in human stool, even though egg morphology 
may be sufficient for species identification (Leštinová et al., 2016). 
 
A more effective control of this fish-borne disease is complicated by the rapidly increasing 
popularity of eating raw fish, mainly salmonids, but also smoked, dried or fermented fish products. It is 
thus unrealistic to expect considerable changes in the present trend, i.e. increase of human cases even in 
non-endemic areas. Eradication of this parasitic disease is also impeded by global trade with fresh fish 
transported on ice and tourism. Food-safety measures should include veterinary inspection of fish 
products before their importation to decrease the risk of human infection with plerocercoids of broad 
fish tapeworms. 
 
3.4. Concluding remarks and future trends 
 
Our understanding of many aspects of the species diversity, biology, epidemiology, host-
associations, evolutionary history and distribution of broad fish tapeworms is still rather limited, partly 
due to the fact that the human disease caused by these large-sized cestodes is not considered to be 
serious and life-threatening. However, recent application of molecular methods, i.e. genotyping of 
 ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
32 
 
clinical samples, has provided us a powerful tool that makes it possible to identify reliably causative 
agents of human disease. This has also consequences for a better understanding of transmission of 
individual species, their geographical distribution and life cycles. It is highly recommended to always 
fix at least part of clinical samples (as well as larvae in fish intermediate hosts if found during 
veterinary inspection) in molecular-graded ethanol for molecular characterization. The most effective 
measure to control this fish-borne helminthosis is to simply avoid meals from raw or poorly cooked 
fish and their products, which is, however, a fashion trend last years.

Fish-borne zoootic cestodes (Diphyllobothrium and relatives) in cold climates: a never-ending story of 
neglected and re-emergent parasites – highlights 
 
 Fish-borne cestodes capable of infecting humans are represented by broad tapeworms 
(Diphyllobothriidea) 
 Data on all human-infecting broad fish tapeworms are summarized 
 Focus is on rare or uncommon species that were largely neglected 
 Increasing popularity of eating raw fish results in higher numbers of human cases
