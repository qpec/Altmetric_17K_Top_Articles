Context: Low 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] is associated with coronary heart disease (CHD) in
people who are white and Chinese but not black or Hispanic. Vitamin D binding globulin (VDBG)
avidly binds 25(OH)D, reducing its bioavailability, and differs in isoform and concentration by race.
Objective: Evaluate associations of VDBG with CHD and whether accounting for VDBG or estimating
bioavailable 25(OH)D explains the heterogeneity of the association of 25(OH)D with CHD.
Design and Setting: We conducted a case–cohort study within the Multi-Ethnic Study of
Atherosclerosis. Participants with an incident CHD event over 12 years of follow-up (n = 538)
and a randomly assigned subcohort (n = 999) were included. We measured baseline 25(OH)D, VDBG,
and isoforms using mass spectrometry and estimated bioavailable 25(OH)D from published
equations.
Results: VDBG was associated with an increased risk of CHD [hazard ratio, 1.77 (95% confidence
interval, 1.46 to 2.14) per standard deviation increment, P , 0.0001], without evidence of het-
erogeneity by race or isoform (each P for interaction . 0.1). Low total 25(OH)D was differentially
associated with CHD events, by race, with or without adjustment for VDBG (P for interaction = 0.04
or 0.05, respectively). Associations of 25(OH)D with CHD were strengthened with adjustment for
VDBG among participants who were white or Chinese, and bioavailable 25(OH)D was associated
with CHD events only among white participants.

 Conclusions: High VDBG concentration was associated with CHD events in all racial and ethnic
groups. Incorporation of VDBG strengthened existing associations of 25(OH)D with CHD but did
not explain racial heterogeneity in associations of 25(OH)D with CHD. (J Clin Endocrinol Metab 102:
3075–3084, 2017)
L
ow circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D]
concentrations are associated with increased risk of
coronary heart disease (CHD) across observational
studies of predominantly white participants (1–6).
25(OH)D, which is the precursor of calcitriol, is the
primary circulating form of vitamin D and the biomarker
that is traditionally used to determine vitamin D de-
ficiency or sufficiency states. Circulating 25(OH)D
concentrations are substantially lower among black
and Hispanic people but are not associated with CHD
among these race and ethnicity groups (7–13).
One possible explanation for the observed racial het-
erogeneity is differences in the amount of 25(OH)D that is
available to bind to target tissues. The majority of circu-
lating 25(OH)D is tightly bound to vitamin D binding
globulin (VDBG), with a smaller amount (10% to 15%)
loosely bound to albumin, and ,1% circulating in a free,
unbound form (14, 15). VDBG is a highly polymorphic
gene; isoforms differ strongly by race and by affinity for
25(OH)D (16). A recent study reported similar bioavail-
able 25(OH)D concentrations among whites and blacks,
despite marked differences in total 25(OH)D (17). How-
ever, subsequent studies have failed to replicate this
finding when VDBG concentrations were measured using
gold-standard
liquid
chromatography–tandem
mass
spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) methods (18–21). Differences
in VDBG and vitamin D availability may be critical to
interpreting 25(OH)D concentrations and associated
health outcomes, including differences by race and
ethnicity.
We tested the hypothesis that VDBG concentration and
isotype alter the association of 25(OH)D with CHD events
in a community-based, multiracial and multiethnic study
population. We measured serum VDBG concentrations,
VDBG isotype, and 25(OH)D by using highly specific
LC-MS/MS assays and evaluated associations with incident
CHD events by race over long-term follow-up.
Methods
Study population
In the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA), 6814
community-dwelling adults between the ages of 45 and 84 years
were recruited between July 2000 and August 2002 from six US
communities: Baltimore City and Baltimore County, Maryland;
Chicago, Illinois; Forsyth County, North Carolina; Los Angeles
County, California; northern Manhattan and the Bronx, New
York; and St. Paul, Minnesota (22). MESA excluded patients
who had prevalent clinical cardiovascular disease at baseline,
defined as myocardial infarction, angina, stroke, transient is-
chemic attack, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, use of nitro-
glycerin, prior angioplasty, coronary artery bypass graft
surgery, valve replacement, pacemaker or defibrillator implant,
or any surgery on the heart or arteries. The cohort of partici-
pants is 38% non-Hispanic white, 28% African American, 22%
Hispanic, and 12% Chinese American. The institutional review
boards at all participating centers approved the study, and all
participants gave written informed consent.
We selected participants for measurement of VDBG and al-
bumin in 2015 by using a case–cohort design. Included were a
random sample of MESA participants (subcohort, n = 999) and all
thosewhohadanincidentCHDeventby 31December 2013(cases,
n = 538) (Fig. 1). Incident CHD was defined as the first occurrence
of any one of the following events during follow-up: acute myo-
cardial infarction, death from CHD, resuscitated cardiac arrest,
definite angina, or probable angina with coronary revascularization
(23). Participants with 25(OH)D concentrations .100 ng/mL
(suggestive of high-dose supplementation) and participants with-
out CHD follow-up data were excluded from analyses.
Measurement of exposures
VDBG concentration and isoform were measured simulta-
neously via an LC-MS/MS assay (18, 20). This assay quantifies
VDBG concentration by measuring the abundance of two VDBG
peptide sequences that are conserved across VDBG isoforms,
generating results that are not biased by VDBG genotype
(a concern with commercially available antibody-based assays)
(21, 24). The assay uses internal standards to increase precision,
with interassay coefficients of variation of 3.1% to 9.1% across a
range of concentrations. At the same time, the assay detects the
presence or absence of peptide sequences that define common
VDBG isoforms, allowing direct determination of expressed
isoforms (including multiple isoforms for heterozygotes). Isoform
identification has previously been validated with genetic data
(18). Total 25(OH)D (sum of 25-hydroxyvitamins D2 and D3)
was measured via high-performance LC-MS/MS (25). Calibra-
tion was confirmed with National Institute of Standards and
Technology standard reference material 972a (26). Albumin was
measured via the modified Doumas and Rodkey procedures on
the Beckman-Coulter DxC. Bioavailable 25(OH)D concentra-
tions were calculated via published equations allowing for six
affinity coefficients based on VDBG isoforms (17, 27, 28). An-
alyses were repeated with bioavailable 25(OH)D calculated
with a single binding coefficient and yielded similar results.
Measurement of covariates
Covariates were ascertained at the baseline MESA exami-
nation, concurrent with VDBG, albumin, and 25(OH)D.
Participants completed self-administered questionnaires,
interviewer-administered standardized interviews, and extensive in-
person examinations, yielding demographic and lifestyle charac-
teristics, medical history, anthropometric measurements, and
laboratory data. Race and ethnicity were characterized based on

 participants’ responses to questions modeled from the year 2000
US Census. General health was self-reported on a questionnaire as
excellent, very good, good, fair, or poor. Leisure-time physical
activity was estimated as the total amount of intentional exercise
performed in a usual week and measured in metabolic equiva-
lent task-minutes. Diabetes status was defined by the use of
an oral hypoglycemic medication or insulin, fasting blood
glucose $126 mg/dL, nonfasting blood glucose $200 mg/dL, or
hemoglobin A1c $6.5% (29). Body mass index was calculated as
weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared. Blood
pressure was ascertained as the mean of the last two of three
seated measurements. Total and high-density lipoprotein cho-
lesterol were measured via the cholesterol oxidase method.
Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels were calculated via
the Friedewald equation. Intact serum parathyroid hormone
(PTH) was quantified by a DxI automated two-site immuno-
assay on a clinical analyzer (Beckman-Coulter Inc, Brea, CA)
(30). Circulating fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF-23) was
measured in previously unthawed serum via the Kainos im-
munoassay, which detects the full-length, biologically intact
FGF-23 molecule via midmolecule and distal epitopes. Urine
albumin excretion was quantified as the ratio of albumin to
creatinine in a single-voided urine sample. Serum calcium and
phosphate were measured by indirect potentiometry on a DxC
Synchron analyzer (Beckman-Coulter Inc) and timed-rate col-
orimetric reaction method, respectively (31). Glomerular fil-
tration rate was estimated from the creatinine-based Chronic
Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration equation (32).
Data on vitamin D supplement use were not available.
Statistical analysis
We examined baseline characteristics of the subcohort
participants across tertiles of VDBG and bioavailable 25(OH)D
concentrations; these were summarized with means and stan-
dard deviations, or medians and interquartile ranges for highly
skewed variables. For the entire analysis population, we tab-
ulated the number of CHD events overall and by race and
ethnicity. We accounted for the small (,5%) amount of missing
data by using multiple imputation with chained equations in all
regression analyses (33); resulting estimates were combined
according to Rubin’s rules to account for the variability in the
imputation procedure (34).
In the primary analysis, we examined the associations of
VDBG, total 25(OH)D, and bioavailable 25(OH)D concen-
trations with incident CHD in a series of Cox regression models
with robust variance estimation that accounted for the case–
cohort study design, using the Prentice method (35–37). Par-
ticipants were considered at risk from the date of their baseline
MESA examination until the first occurrence of the composite
outcome or until they were censored due to death from non-
CHD cause (n = 160), loss to follow-up, or the end of available
follow-up. The first model included adjustment for age, sex, race
or ethnicity, MESA study site, income, and season. The second
model further adjusted for additional potential confounders:
diabetes, body mass index, smoking status, self-reported general
health status, log-transformed intentional physical activity,
estimated glomerular filtration rate, systolic blood pressure, use
of antihypertensive medications, use of lipid-lowering medi-
cations, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, C-reactive protein
(CRP) (log-transformed) concentration, and serum albumin.
When we examined the association of VDBG with incident
CHD, a third model of potential mediators further adjusted for
calcium, phosphorus, log-transformed PTH, log-transformed
FGF-23, total 25(OH)D, and a total 25(OH)D by race or
ethnicity interaction term.
When we examined the associations of total 25(OH)D with
incident CHD, the third model further adjusted for VDBG
concentration alone. To formally test differences in effect es-
timates from associations of total 25(OH)D with incident CHD
before and after adjustment for VDBG, we calculated a con-
fidence interval for the difference in b coefficients, by means of
bootstrap methods (38) (2000 bootstraps for each of the 20
imputation datasets). Estimates were combined across impu-
tations according to Rubin’s rules.
Categorical covariates were modeled via indicator variables,
except for self-reported health, which was modeled as a con-
tinuous term; continuous covariates were modeled linearly
unless noted. Subgroup-specific hazard ratios (HRs) were cal-
culated via linear combination of regression coefficients for

 main effect and cross-product terms. Interactions were tested by
the Wald test of a product term for the exposure of interest and
race and ethnicity or isoform categories. Sensitivity analyses
completely stratified by race and ethnicity or VDBG isoform
yielded similar results. All analyses were conducted with R 3.3.0
(39); a two-sided P of ,0.05 was considered statistically sig-
nificant for all analyses.
Results
VDBG concentrations and isoforms
At baseline, the mean [standard deviation (SD)] age in
the subcohort was 59.4 (9.8) years, and 57% of partic-
ipants were women. The measured VDBG isoform varied
by race and ethnicity. The most common haplotype
among white and Hispanic participants was Gc1s/Gc1s
(41.8% and 31.7%, respectively) and among black and
Chinese participants was Gc1f/Gc1f (58.5% and 35.1%,
respectively). However, VDBG concentration did not
vary substantially by race or ethnicity [mean (SD) in
micrograms per milliliter: white, 250.9 (39.5); Chinese,
236.9 (29.2); black, 249.6 (37.5); and Hispanic, 251.4
(37.1)]. Gc2 and Gc1f haplotype carriage were associ-
ated with lower and higher concentrations of VDBG,
respectively (Supplemental Table 1). Participants with
higher VDBG concentrations were more likely to be fe-
male and to smoke and less likely to have diabetes, and
they were characterized by higher serum concentrations
of 25(OH)D, 1,25(OH)D, high-density lipoprotein, and
CRP and lower physical activity levels (Table 1). VDBG
concentrations varied seasonally and were highest in the
summer [mean (SD), 254.4 (41.9) mg/mL] and lowest
in the winter [238.9 (33.6) mg/mL]. VDBG concen-
trations were weakly positively correlated with 25(OH)D
(r = 0.20), weakly inversely correlated with bioavailable

log-transformed CRP (r = 0.30) (Supplemental Table 2).
VDBG and CHD events
Participants were followed for a median (interquartile
range) of 12.4 (5.6–12.8) years. For incident CHD, the
qualifying event was myocardial infarction for 204
participants, angina for 200 participants, resuscitated
cardiac arrest for 16 participants, and CHD death for 88
participants. (Supplemental Table 3).
Participants with higher circulating concentrations of
VDBG were more likely to experience a CHD event (fully
adjusted HR, 1.78; 95% confidence interval, 1.46 to
2.14, per SD increment in VDBG concentration, P ,
0.0001) (Table 2). We did not observe HR heterogeneity
in the association of VDBG and CHD by race or ethnicity
(P for interaction = 0.59) (Table 2) or by VDBG isoform
(P for interaction = 0.86) (Supplemental Table 4). Sec-
ondary analyses that repeated the primary analysis with a
more restrictive definition of incident CHD that included
only incident myocardial infarction, CHD death, and
resuscitated cardiac arrest yielded stronger results (Sup-
plemental Table 5). Haplotype carriage was also asso-
ciated with CHD events, but magnitudes of association
appeared weaker than those of VDBG concentration
(Supplemental Table 6).
25(OH)D and CHD events
Mean (SD) bioavailable 25(OH)D concentration was
4.6 (2.4) ng/mL and varied by race and ethnicity: 5.7 (2.5)
ng/mL for white participants, 4.4 (1.9) ng/mL for Chinese
participants, 2.5 (1.3) ng/mL for black participants, and
4.3 (1.9) ng/mL for Hispanic participants (P , 0.0001).
Participants with high circulating bioavailable 25(OH)D
were less likely to be female or diabetic, were more likely
to have high income, better self-reported health, and high
physical activity levels, and were characterized by low
CRP and interleukin-6 (Supplemental Table 7).
Low circulating bioavailable 25(OH)D was associated
with incident CHD events among white participants but
not among black or Hispanic participants (Fig. 2 and
Table 3). Results were not materially changed when
bioavailable 25(OH)D was calculated assuming a single
binding coefficient across all six isoforms.
Like bioavailable 25(OH)D, low circulating total
25(OH)D was associated with CHD events among white
and Chinese participants. Associations of 25(OH)D with
CHD were strengthened by additional adjustment for
VDBG (Supplemental Table 8). Among white partici-
pants, adjustment for VDBG significantly increased the
magnitude of associations of 25(OH)D with CHD events
by 15% [ratio of HR from Model 3 to Model 2, per
10-ng/mL decrement of 25(OH)D, 1.15 (1.05, 1.26),
P = 0.002]. Adjustment for VDBG did not account for the
heterogeneity by race and ethnicity (global P for in-
teraction by race or ethnicity = 0.04).
Discussion
In this multiethnic community-based cohort of adults
without clinical cardiovascular disease at baseline, high
circulating serum VDBG was strongly associated with
increased risk of adjudicated incident CHD events. This
association was strong, independent of known CHD risk
factors, and consistent across race and ethnicity. Ad-
justment for VDBG strengthened associations of total
25(OH)D concentration with CHD events in white
participants, and estimated bioavailable 25(OH)D was
significantly associated with CHD events in whites.
However, accounting for VDBG through adjustment or
estimation of bioavailable 25(OH)D did not eliminate the
racial and ethnic heterogeneity observed in 25(OH)D
associations with CHD events, with null associations still
present for black and Hispanic participants.
With the polyclonal enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assay for VDBG, free and bioavailable 25(OH)D were
more strongly associated with bone mineral density than
total 25(OH)D (28), but VDBG was not associated with
heart failure (40). One recent case–control study, which

ethnicity, study site, income, season, diabetes mellitus, body mass
index, smoking status, self-reported general health status, log-
transformed intentional physical activity, estimated glomerular
filtration rate, systolic blood pressure, antihypertensive medications,
lipid-lowering medications, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, log-
transformed CRP concentration, and serum albumin. Global P for
interaction by race for each metabolite was 0.05 for total 25(OH)D,
0.45 for BAVD, and 0.58 for VDBG.

 measured VDBG via the isoform-independent LC-MS/MS
assay, found that higher VDBG concentrations were
strongly associated with incident end-stage renal disease
(41). These associations are consistent in direction with
our observed associations with incident CHD events. In
contrast, among patients with liver failure, lower VDBG
concentration is associated with in-hospital mortality,
perhaps because it is a sign of severely impaired liver
synthetic function in this setting (42–45).
The associations between VDBG and CHD may or may
not be causal. VDBG is an acute phase reactant, and our
noted associations could therefore reflect confounding by
inflammation. However, adjustment for CRP, another acute
phase reactant modestly correlated with VDBG, did not
attenuate the associations. VDBG could promote CHD by
sequestering circulating 25(OH)D and 1,25(OH)2D and
reducing transport to target tissues. However, animal
studies have explored the influence of VDBG on the
biological activity of 1,25(OH)2D3 and question this
hypothesis: VDBG-null mice have severely depleted
circulating 1,25(OH)2D3 in the blood, but they have
preserved 1,25(OH)2D3 levels in tissue and are nor-
mocalcemic (46). VDBG is the major protein responsible
for the sequestration of G-actin monomers from plasma
after tissue injury. Low concentrations of VDBG have
been associated with worse survival among trauma pa-
tients (47, 48). Circulating VDBG could also plausibly be
related to CHD via other mechanisms, through modula-
tion of inflammatory processes and innate immunity, and
through binding of fatty acids as well as directly helping to
regulate neutrophil, macrophage, fibroblast, and osteo-
clast activity (49).
Previously,
VDBG
isoforms
and
concentrations
measured by monoclonal immunoassay were reported to
vary by race (17). An important implication of this ob-
servation was that differences in VDBG may help explain
racial variation in associations of total 25(OH)D con-
centration with health outcomes. However, subsequent

 studies demonstrated that the monoclonal immunoassay
is biased by isoform and that VDBG concentrations
measured by other methods did not differ significantly by
race (18, 20, 21). Our data, generated via a mass spec-
trometry assay that is thought to quantify VDBG con-
centration without bias by race, ethnicity, or isoform,
suggest that differences in VDBG do not explain racial or
ethnic heterogeneity in associations of 25(OH)D with
CHD and that alternative explanations should be sought.
If the free and weakly bound portions of circulating
25(OH)D are most accessible to target tissues, accounting
for VDBG could improve the precision of classifying
25(OH)D status and strengthen relationships with health
outcomes. Indeed, free and bioavailable 25(OH)D were
found to be more strongly associated with BMD than total
25(OH)D (50) among healthy young adults and more
strongly associated with PTH and calcium among incident
hemodialysis patients (27). Consistent with these observa-
tions, we observed that adjustment for VDBG concentration
substantially increased the magnitude of association of total
25(OH)D with CHD events among white and Chinese
participants, and bioavailable 25(OH)D was strongly as-
sociated with CHD events among white participants.
However, associations of bioavailable 25(OH)D with health
outcomes should be interpreted with caution because they
may be confounded by VDBG concentration, which we
found to be strongly associated with both lower bioavailable
25(OH)D concentration and higher CHD risk. The finding
of associations between the Gc2 and Gc1 haplotypes and
incident CHD warrants investigation and replication.
Strengths of this study its racially and ethnically di-
verse, community-based population; the evaluation of
incident events relevant to 25(OH)D and VDBG over a
long period of longitudinal follow-up; the large number
of observed events sampled in an efficient study design;
and the use of state-of-the-art assays to measure 25(OH)D,
VDBG, and isoform. As in any observational study,
potential associations of VDBG and 25(OH)D with CHD
events may be confounded by unmeasured factors that
are associated with both mineral metabolism markers
and CHD outcomes. However, confounding is mini-
mized in MESA because, by design, participants were free
of self-reported clinical cardiovascular disease at base-
line and because potential confounding variables were
quantified in a high-quality manner. An additional lim-
itation is that our study may have limited power to detect
associations of small magnitude within individual racial
and ethnic groups and within individual VDBG isoforms.
Conclusions
Higher circulating VDBG concentrations are strongly
associated with CHD events, and additional studies are
warranted to determine the nature of this relationship.
Incorporation of VDBG assessment strengthened existing
associations of 25(OH)D with CHD events among white
and Chinese participants, suggesting that accounting for
VDBG may help classify health risks associated with low
circulating 25(OH)D in these populations. However,
associations of bioavailable 25(OH)D with health out-
comes must be interpreted cautiously because they may
be confounded by VDBG concentration. Moreover,
neither VDBG concentrations nor genotype mitigated
racial variation in the association of 25(OH)D with
CHD, suggesting that explanations other than differences
in VDBG should be sought for race and ethnicity het-
erogeneity in associations of 25(OH)D and CHD.
