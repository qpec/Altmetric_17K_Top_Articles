grade Renal Trauma Does Not Lead to
Prolonged Hospital Stay

OBJECTIVE
To evaluate the effect of conservative management of high-grade renal trauma on length of hos-
pitalization, we aim to describe characteristics of patients with high-grade renal trauma that are
associated with an increased length of stay (LOS) and the effect of conservative vs surgical man-
agement on hospital LOS.
METHODS
A retrospective review of all patients who suffered unilateral high-grade renal trauma (grade 3
or higher) from September 1977 to August 2012 at San Francisco General Hospital in San Fran-
cisco, CA was performed. Patients’ demographic information, mechanism of injury, injury grade,
data about associated injuries, hospital LOS, and management were collected. Descriptive analy-
sis was performed using chi-square, ordered logistic regression, and linear regression analysis. Mul-
tivariable analysis was performed using a Fine-Gray model of competing risks survival analysis,
adjusting for trauma type, grade, surgery, associated injury, and complications.
RESULTS
The cohort consisted of 408 patients with high-grade unilateral renal trauma of which 257 pa-
tients underwent renal exploration. The adjusted multivariable analysis revealed that trauma type,
injury grades, nongenitourinary surgery, associated injuries, and complications were associated
with increased hospital LOS (P <.01 for all). Renal exploration compared to conservative
management for high-grade renal trauma was not associated with an increased hospital LOS
(P = .10).
CONCLUSION
There is no significant difference between conservative and surgical management of high-grade renal
trauma in terms of hospital LOS. Conservative management of high-grade renal trauma does not impact
patients’ length of hospitalization.

T
rauma is an expensive public health issue in the
United States with estimated costs of up to $600
billion annually.1 As the costs of medical care
continue to rise and reimbursements decrease, there is an
increased emphasis by the medical community on provid-
ing high-quality care at a lower cost. Patients with trauma
commonly incur high rates of complications and longer hos-
pitalizations, thus costs related to their care are high.2,3
Renal trauma accounts for approximately 1%-5% of
all trauma and approximately 10% of abdominal trauma.4
Historically, renal injuries were managed by open surgi-
cal intervention, often resulting in nephrectomy.5,6 However,
a paradigm shift has occurred in the past few decades,
with growing evidence supporting the conservative
management of renal injuries in hemodynamically stable
patients.7-10 Conservative management of most low-grade
renal injuries has become the standard of care, and
emerging evidence also supports conservative manage-
ment in properly selected patients with high-grade renal
injuries.8,11
Protocols for conservative management of renal trauma
vary among institutions and depend not only on the
hemodynamic stability of the patient but also on the
severity of injury. Immediate nonoperative management
of high-grade renal trauma includes bed rest, hydration,
analgesia, and close monitoring including serial physical
examinations and laboratory studies.9,11 As the shift
toward nonoperative management of high-grade renal
trauma unfolds, the impact on costs remains unknown.
We sought to understand the effect of this management
change by evaluating hospital length of stay (LOS) as a
proxy for understanding the costs and complications
associated with differences in renal trauma management.
We hypothesize that conservative vs surgical manage-
ment of high-grade renal trauma does not have a difference
in hospital LOS.

 METHODS
A retrospective review of all patients who sustained uni-
lateral high-grade renal trauma at San Francisco General
Hospital in San Francisco, CA was performed between Sep-
tember 1977 and August 2012. The patients’ demo-
graphic information, mechanism of injury, injury grade, data
about associated injuries, and management were ab-
stracted from the database. Hospital LOS was deter-
mined by admission and discharge, transfer, or death date;
these dates were only available in our database through
August 2012. Patients were excluded if they had missing
variables or bilateral renal trauma, or their hospital LOS
could not be determined. Institutional review board ap-
proval was obtained.
Descriptive analysis of the cohort by hospital LOS and
disposition was performed using chi-square, ordered logis-
tic regression, and linear regression analysis. Multivari-
able analysis was performed using a Fine-Gray model of
competing risks survival analysis, adjusting for trauma type,
grade, surgery, associated injury, and complications. Dis-
charge was defined as the event of interest and death was
considered a competing event, with transfers treated using
censoring. Utilization of the Fine-Gray model as opposed
to a traditional Cox model allowed us to account for the
possibility that covariates may be associated with death.
Model diagnostics were run and an interaction term for renal
exploration and nongenitourinary (non-GU) surgery was
included because of significant colinearity identified in
model testing. STATA (StataCorp, 2013, Stata Statisti-
cal Software, Release 13, College Station, TX) was uti-
lized for statistical analysis and a P value of <0.05 was
considered significant.
RESULTS
From September 1977 to August 2012, 408 individuals were
identified with high-grade (grade 3 or higher) unilateral
renal trauma. Of those patients, 257 underwent renal
exploration. Hospital stay was terminated via 3 disposi-
tions: discharge from the hospital (n = 298), transfer from
the hospital (n = 82), and death (n = 28). Patients who
were transferred had a mean 5.8 days longer hospital LOS
than those who were discharged, whereas those patients
who suffered death had a mean 6.6 days shorter hospital
LOS than those who were discharged (P <.01). There were
significant differences among the injury type (penetrat-
ing vs blunt), injury grade, associated injuries, and com-
plications by disposition (P <.01 for all). Patients who
suffered death or were transferred had overall blunter trauma,
higher injury grades, more associated injuries, and higher
complication rates than those who were discharged
(Table 1).
An adjusted multivariable analysis was performed to iden-
tify significant predictors of increased hospital LOS (Table 2).
On analysis, blunt trauma vs penetrating trauma, grades 4
and 5 renal trauma vs grade 3 renal trauma, undergoing
non-GU surgery for traumatic injuries, having any asso-
ciated non-GU injuries, and having a complication during
the hospitalization were associated with an increased
hospital LOS (P <.01 for all). Renal exploration for high-
grade renal trauma was not significantly associated with

 increased hospital LOS in adjusted analysis (P = .10), al-
though the median LOS for patients who received renal
exploration for high-grade renal trauma was 13 days whereas
those who were managed conservatively had a median hos-
pital LOS of 10 days (Fig. 1).
DISCUSSION
In this study, we evaluated predictors of increased hospital LOS
for patients with high-grade renal trauma at our institution
and identified the effect of conservative and surgical man-
agement on high-grade renal trauma with respect to hospi-
tal LOS. In our cohort, we found multiple factors associated
with an increased hospital LOS in multivariate analysis;
however, undergoing renal exploration was not found to have
a significant impact on hospital LOS. This finding demon-
strates that the notion of performing a surgical intervention
to definitively address the renal trauma does not help pa-
tients leave the hospital quicker compared to conservative
management. In fact, our analysis showed that patients un-
dergoing conservative management have a shorter median hos-
pital LOS, although this was not found to be a significant
difference. These findings suggest that other factors drive hos-
pital LOS in these patients, and that management of high-
grade renal traumas can be performed conservatively without
an impact on length of hospitalization. Our analysis shows that
these other factors, such as having grade 4 or 5 trauma, sus-
taining blunt injury, having associated non-GU injuries, having
non-GU surgery, and having any complications during hos-
pitalization were predictive of a longer hospital stay. These
patients likely have more complex and multiple injuries, and
what is driving length of hospitalization is not the renal trauma
itself, but management of the other injuries sustained.
The prospect of conservative management for high-
grade renal trauma has been supported throughout the lit-
erature, and other studies echo our findings that conservative
management does not increase length of hospitalization.
In a recent study, van der Wilden et al studied 206 patients
with grades 4 and 5 renal injuries across New England and
managed approximately 75% of those patients with con-
servative management. Nonoperative management only
failed in 6.5% of those patients because of their renal
injury.12 Similarly, Elashry and Dessouky managed 51 of 72
patients with grades 4 and 5 renal injuries conservatively.
Those patients managed conservatively were found to have
lower transfusion requirements, shorter hospital LOS, and
fewer complications than those who were managed with
surgical exploration.8 These findings were also demon-
strated by Altman et al in their study, in which 6 of 13
patients with grade 5 renal trauma were treated with con-
servative management. They found those patients treated
conservatively had shorter LOS in the intensive care unit
(ICU), lower transfusion rates, and fewer complications.13
The paradigm shift in management based on clinical status
rather than severity of the injury may be attributed to im-
proved radiographic techniques resulting in improved
grading of the injury, advancements in resuscitation tech-
niques, and availability of interventional radiology.14,15 Ad-
vancements in angioembolization have likely aided in
shifting practice patterns. Brewer et al reported success of
angioembolization in patients with grade 5 renal trauma.
Clinical success was found in 9 patients who suffered grade
5 renal injuries secondary to blunt trauma and were treated
with angioembolization. None of these patients required
any further surgical or radiological interventions.16
In our cohort, undergoing non-GU surgery and associ-
ated injuries were significant contributors to LOS. Patients
presenting with polytrauma have other associated injuries that
may influence the hospital LOS more than the renal injury.
A recent study by Moore et al found that the predictor of hos-
pital LOS is not only the severity of traumatic injury but also
the body region with the most severe injury. They deter-
mined that patients with spinal injuries, for example, stayed
3.1 days longer than patients with lower extremity injuries.17
Complications during hospitalization were also a significant
contributor to LOS in our cohort. Böhmer et al explored factors
that increase ICU LOS in patients suffering traumatic inju-
ries and found similar results. The severity of traumatic injury
as well as the secondary effects or the complications of treat-
ment influenced their ICU LOS. Patients who developed sepsis
had 7.8 days longer ICU stay, and patients with respiratory
failure had 4.9 days longer ICU stay.18 They also determined
that patients with an initial Glasgow Coma Scale ≤8 had sig-
nificantly longer ICU stay.18
The results illustrate potential economic implications as
conservative management of high-grade renal trauma may
not incur higher medical costs related to longer hospital-
izations. Conservative management allows high-grade renal
trauma patients to avoid complications associated with sur-
gical procedures that can also lead to an extended hospi-
tal LOS. Fakhry et al explored the financial results of
treating injured patients at a trauma center with respect
to the patients’ hospital LOS. They found that a patient
with trauma’s hospital LOS closely correlates with the cen-
ter’s profitability. In Fakhry et al’s cohort, the center made
majority of their profit if the patient stayed less than 11

 days and defined that day as a “point of inflection.”19 Iden-
tifying a trauma center’s “inflection point” can serve as a
benchmark for institutions to develop treatment proto-
cols. This becomes increasingly important as trauma centers
are closing more frequently in the United States and clo-
sures are related to profitability.19,20 A recent study esti-
mated that the annual cost of readiness for a trauma center
is $2.7 million dollars, and coupling this cost with low rates
of reimbursement and uninsured patients creates a finan-
cial burden on a trauma center to stay open.20,21 Ulti-
mately, closures of trauma centers are often related to
financial constraints and can have a profound impact on
patient care and outcomes. Hsia et al identified a relation-
ship between closure of trauma centers and increased mor-
tality in patients suffering traumatic injuries as they have
to travel further to receive treatment.20 A cost analysis com-
paring surgical management and conservative manage-
ment of high-grade renal trauma is necessary to further
elucidate the economic implications.
This study has several limitations. First, the study was ret-
rospective in nature and may introduce possible selection bias.
In efforts to control this potential selection bias, the provider-
based database was analyzed to assess the quality of data col-
lection over time. Evaluation by grade revealed significant
variability in the cases per year of low-grade renal trauma,
whereas the incidence of high-grade renal trauma remained
relatively stable over time. This suggests that the database was
adequately maintained for high-grade renal traumas. Second,
our institution had a unique modality of disposition where pa-
tients can be transferred back to the referring institution once
the patient has received appropriate treatment and is medi-
cally stable. Transferring patients back to referring institu-
tions is not applicable to all trauma centers and our results
demonstrated an increased hospital LOS for patients with high-
grade renal trauma compared to those discharged. This in-
crease in hospital LOS can be reflective of transfer logistics
rather than the clinical stability of the patient. Further-
more, the ultimate discharge date for patients transferred back
to their referring institution is unknown and their discharge
date from our institution is not reflective of their discharge
from the hospital. For these reasons, we chose to utilize cen-
soring to account for these patients in our multivariable analy-
sis. Lastly, patients who ultimately suffered death from their
traumatic injuries may have passed from their associated in-
juries not related to their high-grade renal trauma. The pa-
tients who suffered death had a mean hospital LOS that was
6.6 days shorter than those discharged (P <.01) and these results
may relate to associated injuries rather than renal injury. All
patients who suffered death in our cohort had associated
injuries.
CONCLUSION
We found no significant difference between conservative
and surgical management of high-grade renal trauma in
terms of hospital LOS. This suggests that conservative man-
agement of high-grade renal trauma does not extend pa-
tients’ length of hospitalization. These results echo growing
evidence that conservative management is feasible for select
patients with high-grade renal trauma and that it will not
affect hospital LOS.
