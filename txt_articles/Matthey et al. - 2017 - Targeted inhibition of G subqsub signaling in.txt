Obstructive lung diseases are common causes of disability and death worldwide. A hallmark feature is aberrant acti-
vation of Gq protein–dependent signaling cascades. Currently, drugs targeting single G protein (heterotrimeric gua-
nine nucleotide–binding protein)–coupled receptors (GPCRs) are used to reduce airway tone. However, therapeutic
efficacy is often limited, because various GPCRs contribute to bronchoconstriction, and chronic exposure to receptor-
activating medications results in desensitization. We therefore hypothesized that pharmacological Gq inhibition could
serve as a central mechanism to achieve efficient therapeutic bronchorelaxation. We found that the compound
FR900359 (FR), a membrane-permeable inhibitor of Gq, was effective in silencing Gq signaling in murine and human
airway smooth muscle cells. Moreover, FR both prevented bronchoconstrictor responses and triggered sustained
airway relaxation in mouse, pig, and human airway tissue ex vivo. Inhalation of FR in healthy wild-type mice resulted
in high local concentrations of the compound in the lungs and prevented airway constriction without acute effects on
blood pressure and heart rate. FR administration also protected against airway hyperreactivity in murine models of
allergen sensitization using ovalbumin and house dust mite as allergens. Our findings establish FR as a selective Gq
inhibitor when applied locally to the airways of mice in vivo and suggest that pharmacological blockade of Gq proteins
may be a useful therapeutic strategy to achieve bronchorelaxation in asthmatic lung disease.
INTRODUCTION
G protein (heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide–binding protein)–
coupled receptors (GPCRs) acting via heterotrimeric G proteins are
important drug targets for treating a number of disorders. In the air-
ways, Gq-coupled GPCRs are thought to play an important role in
controlling the tone of airway smooth muscle. The individual or
combined activation of many of these receptors induces an increase
in airway resistance, which is the hallmark of airway hyperresponsive-
ness (1). In addition, increased expression of Gq and Gi proteins has
been reported in animal models of asthma (2, 3). Elevated Gq-coupled
receptor agonists such as acetylcholine, thromboxane, or histamine
have also been found in the airways of patients with asthma (4).
Current treatment regimens for obstructive airway disease such as
application of b2 adrenergic agonists or muscarinic antagonists have
limitations, because these compounds target only single GPCRs requir-
ing combination therapy in more severely affected patients (5). More-
over, there have been concerns over the longer-term use of b2 agonists
because of adverse effects or poor disease control (6). In addition, there
exists a group of patients who are partial or complete nonresponders,
demonstrating a lack of efficacy for all current therapies targeting
GPCRs (7). Although many patients respond well to anti-inflammatory
treatment, there remains a subgroup of patients with more severe dis-
ease whose asthma control remains suboptimal despite medication.
We therefore sought to explore the impact and selectivity of the re-
cently reported Gq protein inhibitor FR900359 (FR) on the regulation of
airway tone in health and disease. Direct G protein inhibitors are
currently unavailable with the exception of the Gi/o protein inhibitor
pertussis toxin, which is a valuable tool for the analysis of Gi function
in vitro and ex vivo. Severe side effects have precluded its routine
application in vivo, in particular for clinical purposes. We have recently
shown that FR is a cell membrane–permeable pan-Gq (Gq, G11, and
G14) inhibitor (8). The compound is characterized by high metabolic
stability, making it a suitable pharmacological candidate for in vivo use.
In addition, the potential for local application makes FR an interesting
compound to study airway physiology and disease given that multiple
GPCRs converge on Gq in the pathophysiology of airway obstruction.
Herein, we demonstrate that FR specifically inhibited Gq-dependent
signaling in airway smooth muscle cellsandthat thiscompoundstrongly
reduced airway tone in rodent, pig, and human airways ex vivo. In ad-
dition, inhalation of FR effectively and persistently prevented airway
constriction in both healthy and allergen-sensitized mice without
causing acute cardiovascular side effects.
RESULTS
FR is a specific Gq inhibitor in mammalian airway smooth
muscle cells in vitro
First, we analyzed the expression of Gq protein isoforms in isolated
whole murine lung and trachea using polymerase chain reaction
(PCR) and detected all three Gq family members Gq, G11, and G14
in these tissues. Because airway smooth cells play a key role in regulating
airway resistance, we also investigated murine tracheal smooth muscle
cells(mTSMCs) andfoundGqandG11 expression (fig. S1A).Thesedata
were confirmed by immunostaining with strong pan-Gq expression
detected in mTSMCs (fig. S1B). Next, we tested the action of the phar-
macological Gq inhibitor FR in these cells and discovered that pre-
treatment of cells with 1 mM FR entirely prevented the increase in
intracellular free calcium ion concentration ([Ca2+]i) induced by the
thromboxane analog U46619 (fig. S1, C to E). In contrast, FR was

 ineffective when intracellular Ca2+ was raised by a Gq-independent
mechanism using cyclopiazonic acid (CPA) (fig. S1, C and D). Next,
we investigated the effect and specificity of FR in human bronchial
smooth muscle cells (hBSMCs); immunostaining confirmed Gq ex-
pression in this cell type (Fig. 1A). We used label-free readouts, namely,
dynamic mass redistribution (DMR) and bioimpedance measurements
(8, 9), to assess the specific inhibition of Gq-dependent signaling by FR
in hBSMCs. For this purpose, hBSMCs were pretreated with FR for
1 hour, and concentration effect curves for the Gq-dependent broncho-
constrictors bradykinin (10) and histamine (11) were recorded. Our
DMR experiments revealed that FR (1 mM) completely abrogated re-
sponses to bradykinin (Fig. 1, B and C) and largely diminished effects
of histamine (Fig. 1D). Similar findings were obtained when FR was
applied in bioimpedance measurements before stimulation with brady-
kinin (Fig. 1E). To show that the bradykinin-induced signals in DMR
and bioimpedance measurements were B2 receptor–dependent (B2
receptors are known to signal via Gq), we used HOE140, a B2 receptor
antagonist. Preincubation of hBSMCs with HOE140 (0.1 to 10 mM)
resulted in a dose-dependent reduction in bradykinin-induced signals
in hBSMCs, demonstrating that these signals were B2-mediated (fig. S1,
F and G). Additionally, FR did not have any effect on Gs, adenylyl
cyclase, and Gi signaling in DMR (fig. S1, H and I) and adenosine
3′,5′-monophosphate (cAMP) accumulation assays (Fig. 1, F to H).
These results in label-free biosensor and canonical second messenger
assays suggested that FR specifically inhibited Gq signaling in hBSMCs.
To further corroborate FR-mediated Gq inhibition in hBSMCs, we took
advantage of an inositol-1-phosphate (IP1) assay, which is a well-
known indicator for Gq-dependent signaling. Bradykinin induced IP1
production in a dose-dependent manner, and this effect could be abro-
gated by pretreatment with FR (Fig. 1I). We also probed the effect of FR
at the single-cell level using Ca2+ imaging. Congruent with our observa-
tions in single mTSMCs, pretreatment with the pharmacological Gq in-
hibitor FR abolished bradykinin-induced [Ca2+]i elevation in hBSMCs
(96.3 ± 1.7%, n = 10,233 cells), whereas CPA-induced Ca2+ release was
preserved (Fig. 1, J to L); basal [Ca2+]i was unaltered upon addition of
FR. These experiments indicated that FR is a selective Gq inhibitor in
mouse and human airway smooth muscle cells.
FR induces dose-dependent relaxation of murine, porcine,
and human airways ex vivo
Next, we tested the impact of FR on airway contraction ex vivo using
isometric force measurements. In murine tracheas, methacholine in-
duced a dose-dependent elevation in tone (Fig. 2, A and C) that could
be abrogated completely by FR (1 mM) pretreatment (Fig. 2, B and
C); FR had no prominent effect on basal tone (P > 0.05). When mouse
tracheas were preconstricted with methacholine first, cumulative
application of FR caused a dose-dependent reversal of the constriction
(pEC50: 6.2 ± 0.8, n = 7) (Fig. 2, D and E); neither application of vehicle
or FR after constriction of mouse tracheas by Gq-independent de-
polarization with KCl solution had such effects (Fig. 2F). A single dose
of FR (1 mM) induced complete airway relaxation of mouse tracheas
after methacholine-mediated preconstriction, whereas the vehicle did
not have any effect (Fig. 2, G and H). These findings show that FR is
an effective bronchorelaxant in murine trachea smooth muscle ex vivo.
Because small intrapulmonary airways are also of pathophysiological
relevance in obstructive airway disease, we assessed the potential of FR
to modulate their tone in murine (precision cut) lung slices. Metha-
choline application induced a strong reduction in airway lumen area
indicative of bronchoconstriction (Fig. 2, I and J). When FR (1 mM)
was applied after the agonist, the airways were found to relax com-
pletely, returning to basal levels (Fig. 2, I and K), whereas the vehicle
had no effect (Fig. 2, J and K). These data demonstrated that FR can
reverse Gq-mediated bronchoconstriction in mouse small intra-
pulmonary airways ex vivo.
We next examined the efficacy of FR in pig airways, which are
known to be similar to human airways. A very low concentration
(30 nM) of FR reduced force production in pig airways ex vivo in re-
sponse to a range of concentrations of carbachol in a time-dependent
fashion (Fig. 3A). Similarly, after preconstriction of pig airways with
carbachol, FR induced airway relaxation in a dose-dependent manner
with effects evident at concentrations of 100 nM or higher (pEC50: 7.1 ±
0.1, n = 4) (Fig. 3, B and C). This effect was persistent, because even after
repetitive washout after different durations of FR treatment, only
weak contractions upon subsequent carbachol exposure (10 mM) were
observed (Fig. 3D). Preincubation with FR (30 nM) also reduced
force increases induced by histamine, another important Gq-coupled
bronchoconstrictor, in pig and human airway tissue ex vivo (Fig. 3E).
When using low concentrations, the extent of relaxation proved to be
strongly time-dependent as FR (300 nM) applied after preconstriction
with histamine reached maximal effectiveness after about 45 min (Fig.
3F). Finally, we examined the effect of FR on smooth muscle tone in
human airways ex vivo. Human small intrapulmonary airways were
preconstricted with histamine, followed by application of increasing
doses of FR from 10 nM to 1 mM. As with porcine airways, a strong
bronchorelaxation was observed in human airways, starting at 10 nM
of FR (pEC50: 7.2 ± 0.2, n = 5) leading to about 80% relaxation at 1 mM
FR (Fig. 3G). Thus, FR is a powerful bronchorelaxant in mouse, pig,
and human airways ex vivo.
Inhalation of FR results in prominent airway relaxation
without systemic side effects in vivo
Given the effectiveness of FR for bronchorelaxation ex vivo, we next
examined whether FR also exerted strong airway relaxation in vivo.
To limit potential systemic side effects of Gq inhibition such as hypo-
tension (12), we applied FR directly to the lungs of mice either by intra-
tracheal instillation or as an aerosol. We measured lung mechanics and
investigated the effect of FR on airway resistance with the low-frequency
forced oscillation technique in anesthetized healthy wild-type mice.
As would be expected with this readout, we found that increasing
concentrations of methacholine strongly elevated respiratory system
resistance and that this response was attenuated by inhalation of sal-
butamol (10 mg/ml, 25 ml), the b2 adrenergic receptor agonist that is
the current first-line therapy for the treatment of reversible airflow
obstruction (Fig. 4A). Inhalation of FR as an aerosol (0.1 mg/ml, 25 ml,
2.5 mg per animal) virtually extinguished the methacholine-induced
elevation of airway resistance but had no effect on basal airway re-
sistance, P > 0.05 FR versus control (Fig. 4A). To determine the duration
of the pharmacological effect, we applied a single dose of FR (0.1 mg/ml,
50 ml) into the mouse trachea and measured respiratory system
resistance in response to increasing methacholine concentrations
24 hours later. Our results demonstrated that FR was still active at
this time point and prevented the increase in respiratory system re-
sistance induced by methacholine at most concentrations (Fig. 4B).
Thus, FR can be administered as an aerosol and is a persistent bronch-
orelaxant in vivo.
Although we used the direct intrapulmonary application route to
minimize systemic side effects, we also investigated potential adverse
effects in the mouse cardiovascular system. Because we found FR to

our in vivo preparations, blood pressure
and heart rate were monitored in anesthe-
tized healthy wild-type mice with a Millar
catheter in the carotid artery for 10 min
after inhalation of FR (2.5 mg per animal,
which is the amount that proved to
strongly reduce airway resistance; see
Fig. 4, A and B). Our experiments revealed
that neither FR nor control solution af-
fected blood pressure (Fig. 4C) or heart
rate (fig. S2A) when applied as an aerosol.

a rapid drop in blood pressure (Fig. 4C),
underscoring theefficacy of ourinhalation

detectovertacutecardiovascularsideeffects
upon local application of FR to the mouse
lungs, we investigated in more detail its
effects in the cardiovascular system by in-
jectingFRdirectly into the jugularvein and
monitoring carotid blood pressure and
heart rate. We found that intravenous ap-
plication of 2.5 mg of FR did not alter
cardiovascular characteristics (Fig. 4D
and fig. S2B), whereas injection of a five
times higher dose of FR (12.5 mg per
animal) induced a marked drop in blood
pressure (Fig. 4D and fig. S2B). We also
assessed the biodistribution of FR upon
aerosol application by measuring FR con-
centrations in the plasma and different or-
gans with liquid chromatography coupled
to mass spectrometry (LC-MS) 10 min af-
ter FR administration. These experiments
revealed at least 10 times higher concen-
trationsoftheGqinhibitorFRinthemouse
lungs compared to all other tissues, in-
cluding blood (Fig. 4E). Thus, inhalation
of a low amount of FR (2.5 mg) prevented
airway constriction without acute effects

obvious systemic side effects pointed to
its therapeutic potential. We tested this

 cell infiltration around the airways (fig. S3, A and B), and elevated
mucin expression (fig. S3, C and D). In addition, eosinophils and neu-
trophils were observed in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid (fig.
S3E), and interleukin-4 (IL-4), IL-5, and IL-13 concentrations were
elevated (fig. S3, F to H). Finally, airway resistance was found to increase
significantly more in OVA-sensitized mice compared to controls upon
challenge with the bronchoconstrictor methacholine (P < 0.001 at a
methacholine concentration of 50 mg/ml), underscoring the successful
induction of airway hyperresponsiveness (fig. S3I). To test the effect
of FR on airway hyperreactivity after OVA sensitization, either vehicle
control or FR was applied locally by aerosol inhalation using a nebulizer.
Hyperresponsive mice pretreated with FR (0.1 mg/ml, 2.5 mg per
mouse) showed almost no increase in respiratory system resistance
upon methacholine inhalation (Fig. 4F). Similarly, mice that were
treated with FR (0.1 mg/ml, 50 ml intratracheally) before each OVA
challenge on days 21, 22, and 23 were also protected against airway
hyperresponsiveness when analyzed on day 24 of the OVA protocol
(fig. S3J). Next, we also tested FR in a mouse model of asthma using
a physiologically relevant allergen, the house dust mite (HDM)
Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus (14). FR was applied intratracheally
(0.1 mg/ml, 50 ml) before each application of HDM allergen. We found
that, as would be expected, this allergen induced peribronchial,

A and B), as well as enhanced mucin expression in mouse airway ep-
ithelial cells (Fig. 5, D and E). In this model, inflammation and mucin
production could not be prevented by FR (Fig. 5, C and F). Similarly, FR
did notreducethe numberof eosinophilsormacrophagesinBALofmice
exposedtotheHDMallergen(Fig.5G).However,intratrachealapplication
of FR before administration of the allergen was highly effective at
preventing airway hyperresponsiveness (Fig. 5H). Given that FR has been
reported to reduce airway smooth muscle growth in vitro (15), we also
investigatedairwayremodelingandpotential modulatory effects of FR in
this asthma mouse model. Quantitation of collagen deposition revealed
a strong increase around airways in mice administered with HDM al-
lergen, an indication of early airway remodeling. We found that FR
could prevent this increase in collagen deposition in the HDM mouse
model of asthma (Fig. 5, I to L). Next, we investigated airway smooth
muscle mass, an indicator of chronic airway remodeling, but could
not detect differences in lung sections from control mice [1.5 ±

HDM allergen (1.9 ± 0.3 mm2/mm, n = 6, P > 0.05 versus controls),

 and sensitized mice in vivo, we found that inhalation of FR prevented
the elevation of airway resistance without acute effects on blood pres-
sure orheart rate. In addition,FRalso suppressedairway hyperreactivity
and even early airway remodeling, but not inflammation in mouse
models of airway hyperresponsiveness.
Earlier studies targeting the Gq pathway used either genetic
approaches (12, 16, 17) or compounds that interact with GPCRs
(15, 18) or Gq downstream signaling (19). A Gq inhibitor isolated from
Chromobacterium sp. QS3666 (YM-254890) illustrated the therapeutic
potential of pharmacological G protein inhibition, because it promoted
antithrombotic and vasodilatory effects in mice, rats, and monkeys
(20–23). However, in these studies, the Gq inhibitor was often ad-
ministered as a bolus injection directly into the bloodstream, yielding
depression of the cardiovascular system. We could recapitulate this
effect upon intravenous injection of a five times higher FR dose than
that required for airway relaxation; this was comparable to the quantity
of YM-254890 that was reported to lower systemic blood pressure (21).
We postulated that the lung is an ideal organ for the therapeutic use
of a pharmacological Gq inhibitor, first because of the prominent role
of Gq proteins in the regulation of airway tone in health and disease,
and second, because it is feasible to administer drugs locally via in-
halation (24). We, therefore, tested FR in human airway smooth muscle
cells as well as in mouse, pig, and human tissue ex vivo and found that it
is a highly selective and powerful inhibitor of Gq signaling and a strong
agent for inducing bronchorelaxation. In addition, FR can be applied
locally via inhalation, yielding much higher concentrations of the com-
pound in lung tissue compared to other organs or plasma. Although we
could not detect any cardiovascular adverse effects using the inhalation
route, longer-term studies will need to be performed to investigate the
bioavailability and the distribution of FR; these experiments will also
serve to rule out potential side effects upon long-term application of
the compound.
Because relevant GPCRs inducing bronchoconstriction converge on
Gq (4), the airway-relaxing effect of a Gq inhibitor would be expected to
be more powerful than that of the single GPCR agonists or antagonists
that are currently used for the pharmacotherapy of obstructive lung
disease. Our in vivo experiments underscored this, because inhalation
of FR more effectively reduced airway resistance than did a high con-
centration of the b2 agonist salbutamol, the standard bronchodilator
used for treating obstructive airway disease (7). Moreover, FR com-
pletely prevented and reversed GPCR agonist–induced airway constric-
tion, suggesting that Gq-dependent signaling rather than a receptor
phosphorylation–dependent pathway (25) was primarily responsible
for airway constriction ex vivo and in vivo. In our earlier study, we
reported the long-lasting action of FR in human embryonic kidney
293 cells and in vascular tone regulation of the murine tail artery ex vivo
(8). Here, we also observed a long-lasting effect of FR on rodent, pig,
and human airways ex vivo. Single-dose inhalation of FR led to per-
sistent protection against Gq-dependent airway constriction for at least
24 hours in mice in vivo. This direct airway relaxation effect was the
reason for FR’s protective effect against airway hyperresponsiveness.
Inflammation proved to be unaltered upon intratracheal application
of FR before OVA or HDM allergen administration. Our study has
some limitations that need to be addressed in the future. In vivo airway
resistance measurements only permitted determination of the effects
of bronchodilators applied before bronchoconstriction, whereas in
patients, airway relaxants are administered after the onset of broncho-
constriction. Although we could exclude acute cardiovascular side effects
of FR, future work will need to investigate longer-term FR effects on
other organ systems and during chronic application of FR. Furthermore,
our experiments have been restricted to acute asthma mouse models.
More studies in large animal models are warranted to explore the ther-
apeutic potential of FR for the treatment of chronic obstructive airway
diseases. These studies will also provide information on the impact of
FR to prevent or reverse airway remodeling in chronic lung disease.
For that purpose, different timings and application routes of FR
(inhalation versus systemic) need to be tested. Our data demonstrate a
dominant role of Gq signaling in the control of airway resistance and
identify FR as a promising new bronchorelaxation agent in animal
models.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study design
The research objective of the study was to demonstrate that the phar-
macological Gq inhibitor FR is a specific Gq inhibitor in rodent and
human airway smooth muscle cells and can be used to relax airways
ex vivo and in vivo. The hypothesis was that local pulmonary ap-
plication of the compound would induce a reduction of airway re-
sistance in vivo and would show no overt cardiovascular side effects.
The airway relaxation properties of FR were demonstrated in two
mouse models of airway hyperreactivity. All experiments were per-
formed with appropriate controls. All cells, tissues, and animals were
randomly assigned to the experimental groups. For nebulizer mea-
surements, animals starting spontaneous breathing during the recording
were excluded because this compromised the quality of the recording.
Buffer controls in fig. S1F were also included in Fig. 1C. In label-free
DMR and impedance measurements, only some FR concentrations
were tested in each experiment because of the limited number of airway
smooth muscle cells.
Label-free DMR measurements
The DMR assay used a label-free biosensor for tracking the dynamic
redistribution of cellular matter after cell stimulation. The DMR sig-
nal thereby represented a shift in resonant wavelength indicated in
picometers. DMR assays were performed as described before using a
Corning Epic Generation III DMR-Reader or the EnSpire System
(PerkinElmer) (26).
In brief, 24 hours before the measurements, hBSMCs were
seeded at a density of 7000 cells per well in 384-well Epic sensor
microplates with 30 ml of growth medium (Dulbecco’s modified
Eagle’s medium, 15% fetal calf serum) and cultured at 37°C (5% CO2).
Before the experiments, cells were washed twice with assay buffer
[Hanks’ balanced salt solution (HBSS) with 20 mM Hepes (pH 7.15)]
and stored for 1 hour at assay temperature (room temperature, 22°C).
Hereafter, the sensor plate was scanned by the Epic reader (Corning),
and a baseline optical signature was recorded for 300 s. Pretreat-
ment with FR or HOE140 was performed for 1 hour, then com-
pounds were added in a volume of 10 ml, and DMR was monitored
for 1 hour.
For analysis, the AUC values of DMR signals between 0 and 3600 s
were used to calculate agonist activity. AUC values were transformed
into relative AUC units to give equivalent baseline optical recordings
for all dose-response curves from any given assay plate. Data were
normalized and expressed as percent of maximum activation in-
duced by a saturating concentration of the indicated agonist, which
was set to 100%. n indicates the number of independent experiments,
and each data point represents a triplicate.

 Label-free impedance measurements
Label-free impedance assays were performed as described earlier (27).
In brief, cells were seeded at a density of 6000 cells per well into 384-well
biosensor plates and grown to confluence for 24 hours (37°C, 5% CO2).
Before the experiments, cells were washed twice with assay buffer
(HBSS + 20 mM Hepes) and allowed to equilibrate for 1 hour at room
temperature (22°C). The cell plate was then transferred to the CellKey
(Molecular Devices), and a baseline read was recorded for 5 min before
compound solutions were added simultaneously from a separate com-
pound source plate directly onto the cell plate. Bioimpedance changes
were then monitored for at least 3600 s. n indicates the number of
independent experiments, and each data point represents a triplicate.
Single-cell Ca2+ imaging experiments
Single-cell Ca2+ imaging experiments were performed as described
earlier (28). MTSMCs grown on a coverslip were loaded for 30 min with
the ratiometric dye fura-2 AM (10 mM) in physiological salt solution
(PSS). Then, the coverslip was transferred to a custom-made chamber
of an inverted microscope and washed with PSS. Excitation light
(340 nm, 380 nm) was generated by a computer-controlled monochro-
mator (Polychrome V, TILL Photonics). The fluorescence of the cells
was imaged through a 510-nm long-pass filter and recorded by a
charge-coupleddevice(CCD)camera(ORCA-R2,Hamamatsu).Pictures
were acquired at 0.7 Hz and 30-ms exposure time using the TILLVision
software (TILL Photonics).
Reverse transcription–PCR experiments
Reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) experiments were performed as
described earlier (29), (30). Briefly, at least three murine tracheas were
pooled, and the tissue was homogenized in a TissueLyser LT (Qiagen).
Alternatively, we used whole-lung tissue or mTSMCs from CD1 or
C57BL/6 mice. RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Micro Kit (Qiagen).
Complementary DNA was generated using SuperScript VILO (Invitrogen).
ExpressionofGq,G11,andG14wasdeterminedbyRT-PCR.Thefollowing
primerswereused:Gq,5′-AGATCGAGCGGCAGCTGCGC-3′(forward)
and 5′-GTTGTGTAGGCAGATAGGAAGG-3′ (reverse); G11,
5′-ACGAGGTGAAGGAGTCGAAGC-3′ (forward) and
5′-CCATCCTGAAGATGATGTTCTCC-3′ (reverse); and G14, 5′-
TCACTGCACTCTCTAGAGACC-3′ (forward) and 5′-GACATCT-
TGCTTTGGTCCTGTG-3′ (reverse). PCR products were separated
by 2% agarose gel electrophoresis. DNA bands were visualized by
ethidium bromide staining of the gel, and the size of the fragments
was confirmed by a DNA marker.
cAMP and IP1 accumulation assays
Changes of the intracellular second messengers cAMP and IP1
were quantified with the homogeneous time-resolved fluorescence
(HTRF)–cAMP dynamic kit and the HTRF-IP1 kit, respectively
(CisBio International), on a Mithras LB 940 reader (Berthold Tech-
nologies) according to the manufacturer’s instructions and as de-
scribed elsewhere in detail (31). Briefly, cells were resuspended in
assay buffer, pipetted in 384-well microplates (7500 cells per well),
and incubated with or without FR for 30 min at 37°C. Then, acti-
vators were added, and after 30 min of incubation at 37°C, cells
were treated with detection reagents containing lysis buffer. After
1 hour at room temperature, second messenger levels were detected
by measurements of time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy
transfer signals. All data were normalized to the indicated functional
responses.
Isometric force measurements of murine, porcine, and
human airways ex vivo
Isometric force measurements were performed as described previ-
ously (32). Briefly, mouse tracheas were isolated and connective
tissue was removed in low calcium PSS containing 118 mM NaCl,
5 mM KCl, 1.2 mM MgCl2, 1.5 mM NaH2PO4, 0.16 mM CaCl2, 10 mM
glucose, and 24 mM Hepes (pH 7.4). Then, the tracheas were cut into
rings and mounted on a wire myograph (Danish Myo Technology).
Solution was changed to normal PSS containing 118 mM NaCl, 5 mM
KCl, 1.2 mM MgCl2, 1.5 mM NaH2PO4, 1.6 mM CaCl2, 10 mM glu-
cose, and 24 mM Hepes (pH 7.4) and gassed with 100% O2. After
heating to 37°C, tracheal rings were prestretched to 5 mN. Before the
experiment tracheal rings were maximally constricted with metha-
choline (10 mM).
Porcine lungs were obtained from a local abattoir and transported to
the laboratory on ice. Small peripheral bronchioles were dissected from
one of the lobes of the lung and placed in ice-cold Krebs-Henseleit
buffer containing 2% Ficoll that had been pregassed with 95% O2/5%
CO2 and stored overnight at 4°C (33). The following day, bronchioles
(~1 mm in diameter) were dissected into 3-mm ring segments and
mounted in the wire myograph containing Krebs-Henseleit buffer
maintained at 37°C and constantly gassed with 95% O2/5% CO2. After
a 20-min equilibration period, tension was applied to the tissue, which
was allowed to relax to a final resting tension of between 0.4- and 0.7-g
weight. Before each experiment, the tissues were contracted twice with
60 mM KCl. For FR dose-response curves, tissues were precontracted
with the cholinergic receptor agonist carbachol to give a contraction
that was around 100% of the response to the final addition of 60 mM
KCl. Previous studies demonstrated that this is about 50% of the max-
imum response to carbachol (33) and that contractions are well main-
tained over time. After the carbachol-induced tone had reached a plateau,
cumulative additions of FR were applied.
For the measurement of human airways, lungs were obtained
from patients undergoing lobectomy through Nottingham Health
Science Biobank. Segments of small bronchioles (~1 mm in diam-
eter) were dissected out and mounted in the wire myograph in
Krebs-Henseleit buffer as above. After contraction with 60 mM
KCl twice, tissues were precontracted with histamine to around
100% of the response to KCl. Cumulative concentration-response
curves to FR were carried out as above. Rmax values were obtained
by using a nonlinear fit [log(agonist) versus response (three param-
eters), Hill slope = 1].
Generating precision cut lung slices
Precision cut lung slices were generated as described by Wenzel et al.
(34). Mice were euthanized, then the trachea was cannulated, and the
lungs were filled with a warm solution of 2% low–melting point agarose
(Roth). The agarose was flushed into the alveoli by injecting a small
volume of air using a Saf-T-Intima catheter (BD). Then, warm gelatin
solution (6%) was perfused into the pulmonary vasculature via the right
ventricle. The mouse was transferred to the fridge for gelling of agarose
and gelatin at 4°C. Afterward, the lung wasremovedfrom the mouse, and
single lobes were separated. Lung slices (200 mm thick) were cut with a
vibratome (VT1200 S, Leica) and stored in serum-free medium overnight
in the incubator. Experiments were performed on the next day. The slices
were perfused in a custom-made chamber on the stage of an inverted
microscope, and pictures of small intrapulmonary airways were taken
by a CCD camera at a sampling frequency of 1 Hz. For analysis, the
changes in lumen area of the airways were determined by custom-written

Animal experiments
Animal work was performed in female 10- to 12-week-old CD1 wild-
type or Balb/c mice (Charles River Laboratories). Animal housing and
experiments were approved by the local ethics committee and carried out
according to the guidelines of the German law of protection of animal life
with approval by the local government authorities (Landesamt für Natur,
UmweltundVerbraucherschutzNordrhein-Westfalen,NRW,Germany).
Ethical approval for the use of human tissue study was granted by
the Nottingham Health Science Biobank Access Committee under their
registered behavior technician (RBT) approval from the North West–
Greater Manchester Central Research Ethics Committee (REC
reference number 15/NW/0685).
Lung function measurements
Experiments were performed with the flexiVent system (Scireq). Mice
were anesthetized with a combination of fentanyl (50 mg/kg), medeto-
midine (0.5 mg/kg), and midazolam (5 mg/kg). Then, the trachea was
cannulated and animals were ventilated with a tidal volume of 10 ml/kg
at 150 breaths/min and a positive end-expiratory pressure of 3 cmH2O.
Two deep inflation maneuvers were performed for airway recruitment
before the measurements were started. Resistance was determined by
“snapshot” perturbations based on the single-compartment model. To
induce airway constriction, increasing doses of methacholine (0, 6,
12.5, 25, and 50 mg/ml, 25 ml) were applied as an aerosol via the Aeroneb
Lab nebulizer (AG-AL1100, Aerogen), producing a standard volumetric
mean diameter of the particles between 2.5 and 4 mm. Before metha-
choline application, either FR (0.1 mg/ml, 25 ml), salbutamol (10 mg/ml,
25 ml), or vehicle (dimethyl sulfoxide, 1:10 in NaCl) was inhaled.
Catheter measurements
Catheter measurements were performed as described previously (34).
For analgesia, first, intraperitoneal injections of ketamine (50 mg/kg)
and xylazine (5 mg/kg) were performed. Mice were anesthetized by
1.5% isoflurane via a face mask, and the trachea was dissected free of
connective tissue. Then, the trachea was cannulated for mechanic ven-
tilation, and a nebulizer was introduced between the ventilator (MidiVent,
Hugo Sachs) and the cannula. Mice were ventilated with a stroke vol-
ume of 350 ml at 180 breaths/min. Next, a small pressure catheter (1F)
was inserted via the right carotid artery. Systemic pressure was recorded
using the Millar Aria 1 system (Millar), whereas FR (0.1 mg/ml, 25 ml)
or SNAP (100 mM, 50 ml or 200 mM, 25 ml) was applied as an aerosol
directly into the trachea. Alternatively, FR (0.2 or 1 mg/ml, 12 ml) was
injected into the left jugular vein. Injection was performed with a custom-
made motorized injector using a 10-ml Hamilton syringe connected to a
33-gauge needle (Terumo) via a small tube. Arterial systolic pressure
1 and 10 min after nebulization or injection was compared with basal
pressure levels before injection.
Asthma induction with OVA
For asthma experiments, female Balb/c mice (Charles River Labora-
tories) were used at 10 weeks of age. Sensitization was performed by
applying 20 mg of OVA (Sigma-Aldrich) adsorbed in Imject Alum
(2 mg/ml) (Thermo Scientific) by intraperitoneal injection of 100 ml
per mouse on days 0 and 14 (34). Mice were challenged by nebulization
of 1% OVA (5 ml) or NaCl (control) for 30 min per day on days 21, 22,
and 23. When FR was applied before OVA challenge, FR (0.1 mg/ml in
50 ml NaCl) or the solvent control was administered 30 min before OVA
nebulization. Analysis was performed on day 24 or 25.
Asthma induction with HDM allergen
For asthma induction with HDM (D. pteronyssinus, B82, Stallergenes
Greer), female Balb/c mice at 10 weeks of age were used. Sensitization
with intratracheal application of 1 mg of HDM (in 50 ml of PBS) per
mouse was performed on day 0. Then, mice were challenged by intra-
tracheal application of 10 mg of HDM (in 50 ml of PBS) on days 7 to 11.
Control mice received 50 ml of PBS intratracheally on the respective
days. Mice that received HDM were treated with either control solution
or FR (0.1 mg/ml, 50 ml) 4 hours before each HDM application on day 0
and days 7 to 11. Analysis was done on days 13 and 14.
Statistical analysis
Data are indicated as means ± SEM. Statistical differences were de-
termined using one- or two-way ANOVA and Tukey’s, Dunnett’s, or
Bonferroni’s post hoc test for multiple comparisons or paired or un-
paired two-tailed Student’s t test for comparing two experimental groups,
as indicated in the figure legends. P < 0.05 was considered significant.
Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism software.
