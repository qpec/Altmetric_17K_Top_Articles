Prepregnancy Body Mass Index and Infant
Mortality in 38 U.S. States, 2012–2013
Eugene Declercq, PhD, Marian MacDorman, PhD, Howard Cabral, PhD, and Naomi Stotland, MD
OBJECTIVE: To estimate whether prepregnancy body
mass index (BMI) is related to infant mortality and
whether adherence to weight gain recommendations
mitigates the relationship between BMI and infant
mortality.
METHODS: This was a cohort study using 2012–2013
U.S. national linked birth certificate and infant death files
for 38 states and the District of Columbia with the BMI
measure, including 6,419,836 singleton births and 36,691
infant deaths (infant mortality rate 5.72/1,000). Prenatal
weight gain in three categories was based on adherence
to Institute of Medicine recommendations. The outcome
measure was infant deaths in the first year of life subdi-
vided into two time periods: neonatal (less than 28 days)
and postneonatal (28 days to 1 year).
RESULTS: With normal prepregnancy weight as a refer-
ence, after adjustment, the odds ratio (OR) for an infant
death rose from 1.32 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.27–
1.37) for mothers in the obese I category to 1.73 (95% CI
1.64–1.83) for obese III. Higher BMI was related to higher
rates of both neonatal and postneonatal mortality. The
adjusted OR for the risk of an infant death among sin-
gleton, term, vertex births for those gaining less than the
recommended weight was 1.07 (95% CI 1.01–1.12) and
1.04 (95% CI 0.99–1.09) for those gaining more than rec-
ommended.
CONCLUSION: Even after controlling for multiple risks,
prepregnancy BMI was strongly related to infant mortal-
ity. Efforts to lower the infant mortality rate may benefit
from a focus on reducing obesity among women of
reproductive age.

C
oncerns with maternal obesity are relatively
recent in conjunction with rising rates of obesity
in U.S. society, but clinicians, dating back to the 1940s,
have warned of the relationship between maternal
obesity and poor infant outcomes.1 The most recent
estimate of rates of obesity among adult women
20–39 years of age in the United States was 31.8%2;
prepregnancy obesity rates in the United States have
been estimated at 20% in recent years.3 Of particular
concern is that high rates of overweight and obesity
are also more common among groups that are already
at higher risk for poor birth outcomes.3
Prior studies have examined aspects of the
relationship between obesity and infant outcomes,
both in developed4–8 and developing9 countries. A
recent meta-analysis10 summarized the results from
11 studies that examined body mass index (BMI, cal-
culated as weight [kg]/[height (m)]2) scores in the
obese range (BMI greater than 30) and found a pooled
odds ratio (OR) for the risk of infant death of 1.42
(95% confidence interval [CI] 1.24–1.63). However,
prior studies have been limited in their applicability
to a contemporary U.S. public health context by sev-
eral constraints. Databases utilized to recently exam-
ine
these
questions
include
the
Swedish
Birth
Register, but it is based on a largely homogeneous
country with exceptionally low prepregnancy obesity
and infant mortality rates.5,8 U.S.-based studies have
been based on data from earlier periods when obesity
rates were far lower4 or studies from single states.6,7
The issue of gestational weight gain and its relation-
ship to prepregnancy obesity led the Institute of Medi-
cine (IOM) to issue revised 2009 recommendations,

The objective of this study is to address many of
the limitations of prior studies by examining the
relationships among maternal prepregnancy obesity,
gestational weight gain, and infant mortality with 2
years of recent data from 38 U.S. states.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
This was a cohort study using data from the 2012–
2013 national linked birth and infant death data sets.
The 2003 revision of the U.S. Standard Certificate of
Live Birth included information on the mother’s
height and prepregnancy weight that are needed to
compute BMI. These data are primarily obtained
from the first prenatal visit based on direct measure-
ment of the mother’s height and weight when the first
visit occurred early in the pregnancy or from the
mother’s recall of her prepregnancy weight when
the first visit occurred later in the pregnancy. Weight
gain during pregnancy is computed by subtracting the
mother’s prepregnancy weight from the weight at the
time of delivery as recorded in the hospital.13 State
adoption of the 2003 revision has been gradual with
38 states and the District of Columbia in 2012 and 41
states in 2013 adopting the change.14 We examined
the 38 states and the District of Columbia that had
complete data for both years and accounted for 86%
of all U.S. births in 2012. We used standard defini-
tions for BMI categories (Table 1)15 and limited our
analysis to singleton births. When examining weight
gain, we limited the gestational age to 37–41 weeks
to minimize the effect of gestation on weight gain.
From an initial 7,885,022 overall U.S. births in
2012–2013, there were 6,419,836 singleton births in
the 38 participating states and the District of Colum-
bia and 36,691 infant deaths. Missing data were
excluded from each variable before percentages were
computed.
In the multivariate model we used logistic regres-
sion in models that included demographic and med-
ical risk factors shown in the past to be related to
infant mortality.16 The demographic factors included:
maternal age, race–ethnicity, education, live birth
order, gestational age, and source of payment for
the birth. To address the possible influence of birth
weight, we included a measure of small for gestational
age.17 Maternal prenatal care, measured here as
whether or not prenatal care began in the first trimes-
ter, was also included as were chronic diabetes and
chronic hypertension. We tested for interactions
between BMI and maternal race–ethnicity, age, live
birth order, and medical risk factors (diabetes and
hypertension). Of these, the only consistently signifi-
cant interaction was with birth order and in a subanal-
ysis we stratified our multivariate models by birth
order and found no differences in the results. Given
that the population studied is more than 6.4 million,
tests of statistical significance are not presented in
Table 1 because even small differences were signifi-
cant. When we make specific comparisons of rates in
the text, we cite the associated P value. Based on the
multivariate logistic regression analyses, adjusted ORs
and 95% CIs are presented.
Even with 2 years of data from 38 states,
analyzing infant mortality by cause of death and
BMI can result in small numbers of events. For this
reason we analyzed cause-of-death data for three
composite categories that are widely used in the
literature: preterm-related causes, congenital anoma-
lies, and sudden unexpected infant death. The deri-
vation
of
these
composite
categories
has
been
described in detail elsewhere.18,19 The study was
based on the publicly available linked Birth-Infant
Death
data
set
(http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data_
access/Vitalstatsonline.htm) from the National Center
for Health Statistics and was exempt from institutional
review board review.
RESULTS
Table 1 presents the infant mortality rates by BMI
category and key subgroups for singleton births. The
exclusion of multiple births is the reason the rates in
Table 1 are lower than overall national averages. The
table identifies both subgroups at greatest risk and the
pattern of change within subgroups across BMI cate-
gories and because the former is available from other
sources,16 we focus on the changes associated with
BMI. An overall “J pattern” is seen across subgroups
with underweight births having higher infant mortal-
ity rates (5.4/1,000) than normal-weight births (4.2)
(P,.001), but the infant mortality rate begins to
increase rapidly across the obesity categories: 5.9 for
obese I (P,.001) to 8.2 for obese III (P,.001) when
compared with normal births. The familiar pattern of
higher infant mortality rates in births to non-Hispanic
black mothers when compared with non-Hispanic
white mothers is seen in higher infant mortality rates
in every BMI category (P,.001 in each category).
Births to normal-weight non-Hispanic black mothers
have a higher infant mortality rate (8.0) than births to
non-Hispanic white (6.65; P,.001) or Hispanic (6.6;
P,.001) mothers in the obese III category. Other

 subgroups in which births to mothers in the obese III
category have greater than 1% infant deaths (infant
mortality rate greater than 10 per 1,000) are mothers
younger than 20 years of age, those with less than
a high school education, first-time mothers, smokers,
those with chronic diabetes, mothers who reported
paying for the birth themselves as well as premature
and small-for-gestational-age births.

presents
infant
mortality
rates
per
100,000 live births for the three major cause-of-
death groupings by BMI category. These three major
groupings account for 70.5% of all infant deaths.
Nearly one third of infant deaths were the result of
preterm-related
causes,
which
include
disorders
related to short gestation and low birth weight not
elsewhere classified and most maternal complications
of pregnancy as well as more specific categories such
as respiratory distress of the newborn, bacterial sepsis
of the newborn, and others.16 The infant mortality rate
from preterm-related causes increased most rapidly
with increasing BMI and was twice as high for obese
(228) as for normal-weight women (114; P,.001).
Deaths from congenital anomalies were also more
common in the obese category (130/100,000) than
among normal-weight births (108/100,000; P,.001),
a finding consistent with past research.20 “Sudden
unexpected infant death” is a category that includes
sudden infant death syndrome, an ill-defined and
unknown cause of mortality, and “accidental suffoca-
tion and strangulation in bed,” and the rate of deaths

Table 3 presents the IOM recommended weight
gains by BMI category,11 the mean reported weight
gains and distributions by category as well as the asso-
ciated infant mortality rates. We limited this analysis to
singleton births between 37 and 41 weeks of gestation,
which accounts for the lower infant mortality rates. On-
ly in the case of underweight and normal-weight moth-
ers did the average weight gain fall within the
recommended ranges. For the overweight and obese
categories, mothers on average gained more than the
recommended amount. However, a majority of moth-
ers in the obese III category gained either less than

 (33%) or within (25%) the recommended range. In four
of the six BMI categories (underweight, normal weight,
overweight, and obese I), births to mothers whose
weight gains were within the recommended range had
a lower infant mortality rate than mothers who gained
less than the recommend amount (P,.001). Births to
mothers in the overweight (P,.001) category had
a lower infant mortality rate (P,.001) when more than
the recommended amount was gained compared with
those who gained weight in the recommended range.
We examined the relationship between BMI and
infant mortality rate overall and for neonatal and
postneonatal mortality controlling for multiple con-
founders and the results are presented in Figure 1 and
Table 4. In the multivariate analysis, the “J pattern” seen
in the unadjusted analysis disappears with a lower risk
for infant mortality among births to mothers in the low-
est BMI category (Fig. 1). In the adjusted models, there
remains a consistent increase in the risk of infant death
across BMI categories for overall infant mortality as well
as neonatal and postneonatal mortality. Births to moth-
ers in the obese III category as pregnancy began were
associated with a significantly higher risk of death in the
first 28 days (74% higher), from 28 days to 1 year (51%
higher), and overall in the first year (73% greater).
Stratifying the analysis to look at the relationships
specifically by race–ethnicity, the familiar pattern is
seen in Table 4, although in the case of non-
Hispanic black mothers, the increases in infant mor-
tality are generally more pronounced. To better
understand the possible effect of adherence to weight
gain recommendations, we added adherence to the
model, but given the relationship between length of
gestation and weight gain, we limited the analysis to
full-term (37–41 weeks of gestation) births in Table 4.
Although the actual infant mortality rates were gener-
ally lower, the pattern of escalating risk across higher
BMI categories remained the same for full-term births
in the adjusted analysis without including gestational
weight gain. Adding adherence to the weight gain
recommendations had no effect on the pattern.
We also stratified the analysis by adherence to
weight gain recommendations. With gaining the
recommended weight as a reference, the adjusted
ORs for the risk of an infant death for those gaining
less than the recommended weight was 1.07 (95% CI
1.01–1.12); it was 1.04 (95% CI 0.99–1.09) for those
gaining more than the recommended weight.
We did a series of subanalyses to assess whether
they would have an effect on the relationships
examined. Limiting the sample to women who did
not have either diabetes or hypertension had no effect
on the familiar pattern. Stratified analyses by payer
source and parity also had no effect on the finding of
increasing rates of infant death across prepregnancy
BMI categories nor did stratifying by smoking status.
DISCUSSION
We used a data set of more than 6.4 million births to
examine the relationship among prepregnancy BMI,
gestational weight gain, and infant mortality. We found
a strong relationship between prepregnancy BMI and
infant mortality, which increased substantially across
categories of obesity even after controlling for demo-
graphic and medical risk factors that have been shown
to be related to infant mortality. These differences were
consistent for both neonatal and postneonatal mortality
and across the major causes of infant death. Many
mothers whose gestational weight gain was within the
ranges recommended by the IOM had births with

 slightly lower infant mortality rates than those who did
not, but after adjustment, the differences largely
disappeared.
These findings are generally consistent with past
research although most prior studies focused on neo-
natal mortality and did not include either cause of death
or weight gain data. Both a recent meta analysis10 and
a large population-based study from Sweden8 found
increasing rates of infant mortality across categories of
BMI. Johansson et al found even larger increases in the
adjusted ORs across BMI categories,8 although its
applicability to a U.S. context may be limited. Sweden’s
rate of prepregnancy obesity is half that of the U.S.
(9.9% compared with 20%) and its infant mortality rate
is less than half that of the United States (2.6 compared
with 6.0/1,000 in 2012).21 Chen et al, using data from
the 1988 National Maternal and Infant Health Survey,
found a clear relationship between prepregnancy BMI
and neonatal death but a weak relationship with post-
neonatal death. They found a mixed effect of weight
gain, with mothers in the underweight category who
gained the least weight and the mothers in the obese
category who gained the most weight, at greatest risk
for infant death.4 Salihu et al,7 using Missouri data from
1978–1997 and limiting analysis to neonatal mortality,
found a relationship between BMI and early neonatal
but not late neonatal death for white mothers and a rela-
tionship with all neonatal death for black mothers.
Although this study relies on a large data set, it
does have several limitations. Although the data
account for 86% of all births in the United States, it
does not include data from 12 states and thus is not
fully representative of all U.S. births.14 As noted ear-
lier, the information on prepregnancy weight as re-
corded
on
the
birth
certificate
comes
from
measurement at the first visit or maternal recall. Birth
certificate data do not permit stratification by these
sources, so we were unable to examine the implica-
tions of the alternative bases for the measure of BMI.
The measurement of BMI from the birth certificate is
relatively new and there have been limited studies of
the accuracy of birth certificate reporting of BMI. Park
and colleagues22 found the BMI birth certificate mea-
sure to be generally valid and reliable for population-

 based research. Bodnar et al23 found BMI reporting
most reliable for normal, overweight, and obese 2
and 3 categories but less accurate for underweight
and obese 1 categories. Chen and colleagues4 also
found a strong correlation between self-reported and
measured prepregnancy BMI. A National Center for
Health Statistics study of the quality of reporting on the
revised 2003 birth certificate found reasonable data
quality for the variables used here in our model such
as gestational age, trimester prenatal care began, and
source of payment; however, diabetes and hyperten-
sion appear to be underreported in birth certificate
data.24 Like most published studies from the United
States,4,25 we used the birth certificate measure of ges-
tational weight gain. The limited studies on the accu-
racy of the birth certificate weight gain measure have
found it to not be as reliable as the BMI measure,4
although Oken et al26 found a high correlation between
self-reported and clinically measured weight gain.
Although the association between high BMI and
infant death is robust, that is not proof that prepreg-
nancy weight loss, whether by lifestyle changes or
bariatric surgery, will change this relationship. It is
possible that women who are predisposed to obesity
have an underlying pathology that leads to the poor
outcomes even if they lose weight. Studies of bariatric
surgery suggest overall improved birth outcomes after
weight loss,27 although these studies were not suffi-
ciently powered to examine infant death.
We included small for gestational age in our
analysis with little effect on the overall pattern of
relationship between BMI and infant mortality. How-
ever, one exception was the case of underweight
mothers who had a slightly higher risk of infant
mortality in the initial model, but after the small-for-
gestational-age variable was added to the final model,
that relationship disappeared. The role of maternal
underweight on infant outcomes, although not the
focus of this study, deserves further attention.
This study, in conjunction with others that have
demonstrated an association of maternal obesity with
increased risk of perinatal death and infant mortality,

 builds a convincing foundation for future studies of
perinatal outcomes for women who were obese and
attained a normal or more normal BMI before
conception. If such studies demonstrate that precon-
ception weight loss is associated with improved out-
come,
even
if
the
mechanism
underlying
that
improvement is unknown, a public health campaign
encouraging preconception weight loss to benefit not
only the maternal but also the fetal and neonatal
outcomes would be scientifically grounded, feasible,
and compelling.
The nature of the weight gain recommendations
once a woman is pregnant also deserves additional
attention. The focus of the IOM guidelines was on
general maternal and child health and not simply
infant mortality, but the findings give pause concern-
ing both the lack of adherence and the apparent
limited benefits of compliance, at least in terms of
infant mortality. The IOM’s recommendation con-
cerning more research on the effect of the subclasses
of obesity seems particularly well-founded given these
findings.
Concern about the effect of obesity on the
nation’s health has drawn the attention of providers,
policymakers, and the public, most notably the First
Lady’s “Let’s Move” campaign targeting childhood
obesity.28 This study suggests the need for more
research into the benefits of a systemwide effort to
prevent obesity among women of reproductive age.
