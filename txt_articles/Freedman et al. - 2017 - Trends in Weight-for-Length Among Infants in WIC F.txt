OBJECTIVES: To describe the prevalence and secular trends of high weight-for-length among 
infants (ages, 3–23 months) in the biennial US Department of Agriculture Women, Infants, 
and Children Program and Participants Characteristic (WIC-PC) Survey from 2000 through 
2014 (n = 16 927 120).
METHODS: Weight-for-length was considered to be “high” if it was ≥2 SDs above the sex- 
and age-specific median in the World Health Organization growth standards. Poisson 
regression was used to calculate adjusted prevalence ratios.
RESULTS: The overall prevalence of high weight-for-length increased from 13.4% in 2000 to 
14.5% in 2004, remained constant until 2010, and then decreased by >2 percentage points 
(to 12.3%) through 2014. The prevalence of high weight-for-length was associated with sex 
(higher among boys), race-ethnicity (highest among American Indians/Alaskan Natives), 
and with both age (positive) and family income (inverse). The secular trends, however, 
were fairly similar within categories of these variables. From 2010 to 2014, the prevalence 
of high weight-for-length decreased in 40 states and 3 (of 5) US territories, with the largest 
decreases seen in Puerto Rico (−9 percentage points) and Kentucky (−7 percentage points), 
and the largest increase (+2 percentage points) seen in West Virginia.
CONCLUSIONS: Although the current results cannot be considered representative of infants in 
the populations, the prevalence of a high weight-for-length has decreased among infants in 
WIC-PC since 2010. These decreases were similar across categories of most characteristics, 
but there were substantial differences across jurisdictions, possibly reflecting differences 
in policy and local programs that target maternal and infant health.

in Weight-for-Length Among Infants in WIC From 2000 to

WHAT’S KNOWN ON THIS SUBJECT: Trends in obesity 
among 2- to 19-year-olds in the United States have 
been well-documented; however, there is little 
information on trends in high levels of relative 
weight among infants, which is most frequently 
assessed by weight-for-length.
WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: Among 17 million children 
examined in the Special Supplemental Nutrition 
Program for Women, Infants, and Children, we 
found that the prevalence of high weight-for-length 
increased from 13.4% in 2000 to 14.5% in 2004, 
remained constant until 2010, and then decreased to 
12.3% through 2014.

Since the early 1970s, the prevalence 
of obesity has increased by more 
than threefold among 6- to 19-year-
olds.

2 Somewhat similar increases 
have been seen among 2- to 5-year-
olds, with the prevalence increasing 
from ∼5% (1971–1974) to 14% in 
2003 to 2004.

Despite these well-documented 
trends, there is relatively little 
information on trends in high levels 
of relative weight among infants, 
which is most frequently assessed 
by weight-for-length. 
5 Data from the 
National Health and Examination 
Survey (NHANES) indicate that 
prevalence of a high weight-for-
length (≥95th percentile of the 
Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention [CDC] growth charts) 
among infants (6 to 23 months of 
age) increased from 7.2% in 1976 
to 1980 (SE = 1.0) to 11.6% (1.9) in 
1999 to 2000. 
1 Although there was 
no consistent trend among infants 
from 1999–2000 through 2013–
2014, 
 
6 the small sample sizes (<850 
in each 2-year cycle) result in very 
imprecise estimates. Based on the SE 
of 1.9% for the 1999–2000 estimated 
prevalence of high weight-for-length, 
 
1 
for example, the 95% confidence 
interval (CI) ranges from 8% to 15%. 
The small numbers and imprecise 
estimates in NHANES make it very 
difficult to identify recent secular 
trends.
Because several reviews 
7 
– 
9 have 
concluded that infants with a high 
weight-for-length are at increased 
risk for subsequent obesity, it is 
important to further document 
trends in this age group. In addition, 
information on state-specific trends 
is needed for the development of 
state-level policies aimed at obesity 
prevention. 
8 The objectives of the 
current study of 3- to 23-month-olds 
were to describe1 characteristics 
associated with weight-for-length 
and 
2 secular trends in high weight-
for-length from 2000 through 2014. 
We used data from ∼17 million 
infants who were examined in 
biennial censuses in the Special 
Supplemental Nutrition Program for 
Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) 
Program.
METHODS
Description of the WIC Participants 
Characteristic Survey
Established in 1972, the WIC 
program provides supplemental 
foods, nutrition education, and 
referrals for health care services 
to pregnant, postpartum, and 
breastfeeding women, infants, and 
children up to their fifth birthday 
who meet various criteria, including 
nutritional risk and income 
eligibility. 
10 Approximately 83% of 
all WIC-eligible infants participate 
in the program during the first year 
of life, 
 
10 and approximately one-half 
of all infants in the United States are 
enrolled in WIC.
WIC is administered in each state or 
territory by state health departments 
and eligibility is generally based on a 
family income ≤185% of the federal 
income-poverty level. 
11 For a family 
of 4 in the 48 contiguous states in 
2014–2015, the income cutoff would 
be ≤$44 122. Households with higher 
incomes may be eligible to receive 
benefits if a family member is in 
various federal programs such as the 
Supplemental Nutrition Assistance 
Program or Medicaid.
The WIC Participant Characteristics 
(WIC-PC) Survey is a biennial census 
of participants who are certified to 
receive benefits in April of the census 
year. In each cycle, every state WIC 
agency submits standardized data on 
persons enrolled at local agencies. 
12 
The current analyses include data 
from 8 censuses (2000 to 2014), 
and is based on data from 50 states, 
the District of Columbia, and 5 
territories. Of the 17 million infants 
in the current analyses, 2.5% were 
from a US territory, primarily Puerto 
Rico.
Infant Characteristics
Children’s anthropometric 
measurements were taken by 
trained WIC professionals during 
certification (or recertification) 
visits. 
13 Weight was measured to 
the nearest one-quarter pound, and 
length to the nearest one-eighth 
inch by using an infant measuring 
board according to CDC surveillance 
standards. 
12, 
 
14 We refer to the 3- to 
23-month-olds in the current study 
as “infants, 
” whereas the term refers 
to the first year of life in the WIC 
program.
Race-ethnicity was classified into 
5 categories: non-Hispanic white 
(white), non-Hispanic black (black), 
Hispanic, American Indian/Alaskan 
Native, or Asian/Pacific Islander. 
Race-ethnicity was unknown for 
∼163 000 children, and these 
children were excluded from 
analyses that focused on (or adjusted 
for) race. Relative income was 
calculated as 100 times the annual 
family income divided by the poverty 
level for a family of the specified 
size. Approximately 10% of subjects 
were missing information on relative 
income.
Classifi
 cation of High Weight-for-
Length and Exclusions
CDC recommends the use of the 
World Health Organization (WHO) 
growth standards, 
 
15 rather than the 
CDC growth charts, for infants <24 
months of age. 
16 The WHO standards 
are based on data from various 
international communities and are 
thought to describe the growth of 
healthy children under optimal 
conditions. 
17 We calculated sex- and 
age-specific z scores for each child 
18 
and considered a weight-for-length 
≥2 SDs to be “high”; this cutpoint 
has proposed for the identification of 
“abnormal or unhealthy growth.”16

various ways) level of weight, BMI, 
or weight-for-length, as well as those 
who exhibit rapid growth, are at 
increased risk of subsequent obesity 
in childhood and early adulthood. 
7 
– 
9 
Although weight-for-length rather 
than BMI has been recommended 
for use among infants, 
 
16, 
19 the 2 
measures of relative weight were 
highly correlated (Spearman r = 0.98) 
in the current study.
There were 17 239 260 children 3 
to 23 months old examined in the 8 
censuses who had a recorded date for 
the weight and length measurements. 
Of these, we excluded 129 126 (0.8%) 
who were missing information on 
sex, weight, or length, as well as 
12 156 (0.8%) who had a length 
outside the range (45–110 cm) in the 
WHO growth standards and 145 455 
(0.9%) who had a measurement 
considered to be implausible.*

Statistical Analyses
Analyses were performed in R (R 
Foundation for Statistical Computing, 
Vienna, Austria; www. 
r- 
project. 
org/ 
). 
21 
Initial analyses indicated that 
some of the annual prevalences of 
high weight-for-length for a state 
differed substantially from adjacent 
estimates, and this was further 
assessed in a robust regression 
model (“rlm” function). 
22 Regression 
models were fit for each state that 
predicted annual prevalence from 
year (modeled using splines). Based 
on a residual >10 percentage points 
from the fitted line, we excluded the 
2002 and 2004 data (n = 25 503) 
for Hawaii. The sample size for all 
analyses was 16 927 120.
We first assessed possible knots in 
the trend in high weight-for-length 
prevalence over the 8 censuses 
by using JoinPoint Trend Analysis 
Software (Statistical Methodology 
and Applications Branch, Surveillance 
Research Program, National Cancer 
*Based on WHO growth standards cutpoints,

considered the following values to be implausible: 
weight-for-age < −6 or >5 SDs, length-for-age < 
−6 or >6, and weight-for-length < −5 or >5.
Institute, Calverton, MD). 
23 This 
identified 2004 and 2010 as knots, 
and several analyses therefore 
focused on 3 periods, 2000 to 2004, 
2004 to 2010, and 2010 to 2014.
We describe participant 
characteristics, such as the 
prevalence of high weight-for-length 
and the distribution of relative 
income. To calculate the adjusted (for 
sex, age, and race-ethnicity) change 
in the prevalence of high weight-for-
length in each of these 3 time periods, 
we used Poisson regression models 
to estimate prevalence ratios (PRs). 
24 
These PRs were then used to obtain 
the adjusted change in prevalence 
during the period. For example, if 
the initial prevalence was 14% and 
the adjusted PR (final versus initial 
prevalence) was 0.90, the adjusted 
prevalence would have decreased by 
1.4 percentage points. Because of the 
very large n, statistical significance 
was assessed only in state-specific 
analyses.
RESULTS
The prevalence of high weight-for-
length increased from 13.4% in 
2000 to 14.5% in 2004, remained 
fairly stable from through 2010, and 
then decreased to 12.3% in 2014 
( 
Table 1,  
Fig 1). There were changes 
in other characteristics over time 
( 
Table 1), with the percentage of 
Hispanic infants increasing from 
35% to 41%, and the percentage of 
white children decreasing from 38% 
to 31%. Further, the percentage of 
infants from families with relative 
incomes <50% increased from 26% 
to 35% over the 14 years. As seen in 
 
Fig 1, the prevalence of high weight-
for-length increased with age, but 
there was little difference in the age-
specific trends over the study period.
 
Table 2 shows the prevalence of 
high weight-for-length within 
categories of sex, age, race-ethnicity, 
and relative income. There were 
substantial differences across race-
ethnicity groups, with the 2014 
prevalence higher among American 
Indian (15.6%) and Hispanic 
(13.8%) infants than among black 
(11.9%), white (11.0%), and Asian/
Pacific Islander (8.5%) infants. The 
prevalence of high weight-for-length 
was inversely associated with the 
relative income of the family.

Although race-ethnicity and relative 
income were correlated, with 
black infants more likely to have a 
lower relative family income, and 
whites and Asian/Pacific Islanders 
more likely to have higher relative 
incomes, these characteristics were 
independently associated with 
weight-for-length ( 
Fig 2). At every 
income level, American Indian infants 
had the highest prevalence of high 
weight-for-length, whereas the 
prevalence was lowest among Asian/
Pacific Islander infants. Further, 
within each race-ethnicity group, 
the prevalence of high weight-for-
length was highest among infants 
from families below the poverty 
level. Between 2010 and 2014, all 
20 combinations of race-ethnicity 
and income showed decreases in 
the prevalence of high weight-for-
length. The magnitudes of these 
decreases, however, were largest 
among American Indian and Hispanic 
infants, and smallest among white 
infants.
The adjusted change in prevalence 
between 2010 and 2014 for each 
of the 50 states (and the District of 
Columbia) and selected territories 
are shown in  
Fig 3. In 2014, the 
prevalence of high weight-for-
length varied by fourfold across 
the states, ranging from 5.5% in 
Wyoming (n = 3767) to 22.6% 
(Virginia, n = 40 505). Among the 
states, the largest decreases in high 
weight-for-length between 2010 
and 2014 were seen in Kentucky 
(−7 percentage points) and Utah 
(−4 points), whereas the largest 
increase (+2 points) was seen in 
West Virginia. (Information on the 
prevalence changes for each of the 
individual jurisdictions is shown 
in Supplemental Table 3.) Between 
2010 and 2014, 40 states showed a 
decrease in high weight-for-length, 
with the change being statistically 
significant (<0.05) in 36. In 
contrast, only West Virginia and 
North Carolina showed statistically 
significant increases 
in the prevalence of high weight-
for-length. Of the 5 territories, 
Puerto Rico showed the largest 
decrease in prevalence (−9 
percentage points), whereas the 
largest increase (+6 points) was 
seen in America Samoa.

DISCUSSION
Our findings indicate that the 
prevalence of high weight-for-length 
among WIC-enrolled infants (ages 
3 to 23 months) decreased by 2.3 
percentage points from 2010 through 
2014. This decrease contrasts with 
the increase in prevalence observed 
between 2000 and 2004, as well as 
the lack of change from 2004 to 2010. 
The 2010 to 2014 decreases were 
evident in all categories of sex, race-
ethnicity, age, and family income, 
but were largest among American 
Indian/Alaskan Native and Hispanic 
infants. The magnitude of the 
decreases also varied substantially 
across states, with the largest 
decrease seen in Kentucky (−7 
percentage points) and the largest 
increase (+2 percentage points) in 
West Virginia. Analyses (not shown) 
also indicated that only a very small

proportion of these changes could be 
attributed to demographic changes 
between 2000 and 2014.
Despite the importance of this 
age range for the subsequent 
development of obesity, 
 
7 
– 
9 there 
have been few studies of secular 
trends in high weight-for-length 
among infants. National US data 
indicate that among 6- to 23-month-
olds, the prevalence of a weight-
for-length ≥95th percentile in the 
CDC growth charts increased from 
∼7% (1976–1980) to 12% (1999–
2000). 
1 Although 2-year estimates 
for infants in NHANES should be 
interpreted cautiously because of 
the small samples, the prevalence in 
2011–2012 (CDC ≥95th percentile) 
was 8% (95% CI 6–11).3 However, 
it should be realized that estimates 
of prevalences and secular trends 
in WIC, which focuses on low-
income families, might differ from 
national estimates. For example, 
the prevalence that we observed, 
based on the WHO growth charts, 
was approximately twofold higher 
than in NHANES 2011–2012. 
3 The 
race-ethnicity differences that we 
observed in high weight-for-length, 
however, agree with those in a 
large, multisite pediatric practice in 
Massachusetts. 
25
Despite the recent reductions in 
high weight-for-length in WIC, 
∼12% of the infants in 2014 had 
a level that was ≥2 SDs above the 
median. The first few years of a 
child’s life, in which dietary and 
lifestyle patterns are established, 
may be a critical time for the sub-
sequent development of obesity, 
 
26 
and several reviews 
7 
– 
9 concluded 
that infants with a high weight-
for-length are at increased risk for 
subsequent obesity. Recent reviews 
of risk factors8 and interventions 
27 
in early life for subsequent 
obesity have identified several 
maternal factors, such as excess 
gestational weight gain, higher 
prepregnancy BMI, and smoking 
that are associated with increased 
risk. Among infants, characteristics 
such as rapid weight gain and 
lower socioeconomic status also 
are associated with the risk for 
subsequent obesity. A limitation 
of the current study is that there 
was little information in WIC-PC on 
other characteristics that have been 
associated with high weight-for-
length and child obesity.
There are various factors that 
could have contributed to the 
decreases in the prevalence of high 
weight-for-length that we observed 
between 2010 and 2014. There 
has been increased awareness of 
the high prevalence of childhood 
obesity among US families, society, 
and government, and there have 
been increases in the prevalence 
of breastfeeding. 
28, 
 
29 (It should be 
noted, however, that the prevalence 
of breastfeeding also increased 
between 2000 and 2004, a period 
in which the prevalence of high 
weight-for-length increased.) 
There also have been national 
initiatives, such as Let’s Move, 
along with recommendations 
concerning maternal, infant, child, 
and perinatal health from various 
national organizations. 
30 
–32 Parents, 
early care and education providers, 
and health care providers, along 
with state and local officials, have 
been identified as groups able to 
address child obesity. 
30, 
 
33, 
 
34 The 
WIC food allocation package also 
has been aligned with the Dietary 
Guidelines for Americans 
35 and 
the infant feeding guidelines of the 
American Academy of Pediatrics.36 
This has resulted in increased 
access to a variety of healthy foods 
and changes in food labeling, as well 
as increases in the consumption 
of fruits, vegetables, and whole 
grains. 
37 
 
– 
40 It is likely that some 
of these program changes in WIC, 
such as the increased availability of 
healthy foods, have benefited the 
wider community.37
As has been noted in other studies 
that have examined state-specific 
prevalences of obesity, 
 
41, 
 
42 we found 
substantial differences across states. 
From 2010 to 2014, 40 states showed 
a decrease in the prevalence of high 
weight-for-length. However, as the 
largest decrease and largest increase 
were seen in neighboring states 
(Kentucky and West Virginia), these 
patterns may reflect differences in 
policies targeted at infant nutrition. 
It is difficult to identify the causes of 
these interstate differences, but our 
findings may reflect a combination of 
factors, such as initiatives that focus 
on the implementation of nutrition 
and physical activity standards for 
early care and education programs, 
along with efforts to improve 
healthier food options and physical 
activity offerings in communities. 
43 It 
is also possible that the revised WIC 
food allocation package may have 
been implemented differently across 
states.
There are several limitations to our 
study that should be considered 
when interpreting our results. We 
defined a high weight-for-length as 
being ≥2 SDs in the WHO growth 
standards, and this cutpoint, as 
well as the 95th percentile, is 
somewhat arbitrary, because it is 
based on a statistical distribution 
rather than biological endpoint. 
As has been noted by others, 
 
3, 
 
16 
this classification resulted in fewer 
(∼15% in the current study) infants 
having a high weight-for-length 
than does the CDC 95th percentile. 
There was, however, a very strong 
association between the WHO and 
CDC classifications (a κ statistic 
of 0.9, 
 
44 data not shown). Additional 
analyses also indicated that the 
secular trends in high weight-for-
length were almost identical for 
the 2 classification systems and did 
not depend on whether 2 SDs or 
the 95th percentile was used as the 
cutpoint.
In addition, our findings apply only to 
infants who were enrolled in WIC and 
cannot be extrapolated to all infants. 
Although this program covers more

than 80% of infants in the first year of 
life, 
 
10 the prevalences that we observed 
differ from those based on limited 
national data. 
6 Further, although the 
analyses excluded 2 years of data 
from Hawaii that were inconsistent 
with prevalence estimates for other 
years, it is possible that other data 
errors were included. In addition, WIC 
expanded the set of nutritional risks 
for certification 
45 in 2011 to include 
high weight-for-length, but this may 
have primarily shifted infants across 
certification categories. If additional 
infants were enrolled in 2012 and 
2014 based solely on a high weight-for-
length, we may have underestimated 
the extent of the true secular decrease. 
Although other changes in the 
eligibility criteria for WIC also may 
have influenced the prevalence of high 
weight-for-length among infants over 
time, there is some evidence to indicate 
that nearly all eligible families who 
applied for WIC in recent years have 
been able to participate. 
10 Further, we 
observed decreases in the prevalence 
of high weight-for-length in all 20 
combinations of race-ethnicity and 
income (Fig 2), indicating that the 
decreases were independent of these 
demographic characteristics.
As documented in several reviews, 
 
7 
– 
9 
infants with a high weight-for-length 
are at increased risk for subsequent 
obesity, and we found that although 
the prevalence of high weight-for-
length among infants in WIC is high, it 
decreased by more than 2 percentage 
points from 2010 to 2014. The 
documentation of these secular trends 
in weight-for-length may aid states in 
the development of obesity-prevention 
policies 
8 aimed at further reductions in 
obesity in early life.
