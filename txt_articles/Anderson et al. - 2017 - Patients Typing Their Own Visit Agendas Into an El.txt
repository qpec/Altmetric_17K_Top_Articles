Patients Typing Their Own Visit Agendas Into an Elec-
tronic Medical Record: Pilot in a Safety-Net Clinic
ABSTRACT
Collaborative visit agenda setting between patient and doctor is recommended. 
We assessed the feasibility, acceptability, and utility of patients attending a 
large primary care safety-net clinic typing their agendas into the electronic visit 
note before seeing their clinicians. One hundred and one patients and their 28 
clinicians completed post-visit surveys. Patients and clinicians agreed that the 
agendas improved patient-clinician communication (patients 79%, clinician 74%), 
and wanted to continue having patients type agendas in the future (73%, 82%). 
Enabling patients to type visit agendas may enhance care by engaging patients 
and giving clinicians an efficient way to prioritize patients’ concerns.

INTRODUCTION
C
ollaborative agenda setting is a communication skill that helps 
patients identify concerns early in the clinic visit,1,2 possibly dimin-
ishing the number of “Oh, by the way” items at the end of visits,3 
and increasing patient satisfaction.4 Agenda setting, however, is often lim-
ited by time constraints.4
Electronic medical records (EMRs) offer patients access to their medi-
cal data, including doctors’ notes,5 and have the capability to facilitate 
increased patient involvement in their health care and also contribute 
to their health data. OpenNotes is a national initiative, not a software 
program, that invites patients to review their visit notes written by their 
doctors, nurses, or other clinicians. Existing OpenNotes research shows 
enthusiasm among both patients and clinicians,6 but this is the first Open-
Notes study of cogeneration of clinic notes. 
Allowing patients to type their agenda into their clinic note before a visit 
may facilitate communication of health concerns. This article reports a pilot 
study of feasibility and patient and clinician perceptions of patient-typed 
visit agendas among a vulnerable patient population at a safety-net clinic.
METHODS
This study was approved by the University of Washington Institutional 
Review Board. All patients and clinicians provided informed consent.
Study Population
Harborview Medical Center (HMC) is a safety-net county hospital in 
Seattle, Washington caring for the region’s most vulnerable patients. We 
recruited patients and clinicians between June 9 and July 22, 2015 from 
the HMC Adult Medicine Clinic, a 67-clinician (attending physicians, resi-
dents, and advanced practice registered nurses) primary care clinic serving 
approximately 5,000 patients annually.
We invited a convenience sample of primary care clinicians present 
in clinic when the research assistant (M.A.) was available. Participating 
clinicians’ patients were recruited via telephone the night before their

appointment and asked to arrive 30 minutes early or 
were approached by the receptionist if they had not 
been reached by phone but still arrived early. Patients 
younger than 18 years of age, unable to read or write in 
English, or uncomfortable typing on a computer were 
ineligible. The research assistant met patients in the 
waiting room, provided them with a laptop computer 
with the clinic’s EMR interface, and let them type their 
agenda. The patient typed the agenda in the clinician’s 
“progress notes” field under the research assistant’s name 
with the heading, “The following was typed by the 
patient as part of a pilot study on patient written visit 
agendas.” Participating clinicians reviewed the agenda 
before or upon entering the patient’s exam room, and 
the patient’s agenda remained in the notes section of 
the permanent visit record, adjacent to the physician’s 
note, in the EMR. Patients and clinicians were offered 
gift cards ($10 and $20, respectively) to participate and 
were surveyed after the visit about their experiences.
Patient and Clinician Surveys
The patient survey queried demographic characteris-
tics, self-reported health, and perceptions of the experi-
ence, using a 5-point Likert scale (strongly disagree, 
disagree, neutral, agree, strongly agree). Clinicians 
completed a brief survey after each visit asking if the 
agenda: (1) gave them an improved understanding of 
the patient’s health concerns, and (2) was helpful. Cli-
nicians completed an additional survey at the study’s 
conclusion soliciting age, sex, role in clinic, and percep-
tions of agendas that mirrored the patient survey. The 
research assistant also collected time spent typing agen-
das, number of words typed, and the clinician’s billed 
visit diagnoses and level of service. Surveys are avail-
able in the Supplemental Appendix, available at http://
www.AnnFamMed.org/content/15/2/158/suppl/DC1/. 
Data Analysis
Descriptive statistics characterized patient and clini-
cian demographics and perceptions of the agendas, and 
agenda characteristics such as length and typing time.
RESULTS
Of 209 invited patients, 26 (12%) declined and 54 
(26%) were not eligible. Ineligible patients included 
35 uncomfortable typing on a computer, 9 who could 
not read or write in English, and 10 with difficulty 
both typing and reading/writing. Of the 129 remain-
ing patients, 17 did not come to their appointment or 
arrived late, 112 typed an agenda, and 11 left before 
the post-visit survey, leaving 101 patient participants.
Characteristics of this convenience sample (Table 1) 
are relatively representative of this clinic’s patients, 
and age and diagnoses were not statistically different 
between those who participated and those who chose 
not to participate (data not shown). Agendas were 
brief; 83% of patients typed for <10 minutes, and 80% 
typed <60 words. Table 2 shows an example patient-
typed agenda and responses from the patient and clini-
cian follow-up surveys.

Agenda perceptions were strongly positive among 
both patients and clinicians (Figure 1).
DISCUSSION
Patients attending a safety-net primary care clinic were 
interested and able to type their agenda into the EMR 
visit note. Patients and clinicians felt this improved com-
munication and both expressed interest in patient-written 
agendas in the future. In this diverse population of 
patients with complex medical conditions, 28% employ-
ment, and 32% high school or less education, nearly 
two-thirds of the patients approached were not limited 
by lack of English or computer literacy and participated.
Clinicians often cite inadequate visit time as a bar-
rier to relationship development and communication 
with patients.2,7 Interacting with EMRs during patient 
interviews has also eroded clinicians’ ability to connect 
with patients8 and led to clinician dissatisfaction with 
clinical practice, particularly in primary care.9 This pilot 
study suggests a possible way for the EMR to offset 
the time and computer barriers to communication. By 
allowing patients to set agendas before appointments, 
patients and clinicians can optimize their time together.
The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act 
identifies patient activation and engagement as key 
components of accountable care organizations and 
patient-centered medical homes.10 A few studies have 
addressed electronic portals and patient activation with 
promising initial results.11,12 In the original OpenNotes 
study, 59% to 62% of patients believed they should be 
able to comment on their clinic notes.6 In our current 
study, patients accepted the opportunity to directly 
contribute to their visit notes by typing their visit 
agendas. Future studies could evaluate the relationships 
between agenda setting and other contributions to 
notes, and patient engagement.
This pilot study was limited to a small conve-
nience sample at a single clinic with no comparison 
group, and the results may not be generalizable to 
other settings. We provided financial incentives for 
participants, and a research assistant facilitated the 
agenda typing process. This study involved a vulner-
able patient population; it is also important to note 
that of those approached, 12% declined and 26% were 
not eligible because they could not type or write in 
English. Though not available in this study, patient 
navigators, peer coaches, translators, or audio and 
touch-screen technologies may be able to address lim-
itations in English or computer literacy, or low vision, 
hearing, or comprehension. Nevertheless, approxi-
mately one-half of our target patients completed the 
intervention and both patients and clinicians found 
agenda setting worthwhile.

Clinician Comment; Examples of Patients’ and 
Clinicians’ Responses from the Follow-Up Survey
A. Example of Patient-Typed Agenda and Clinician 
Response
Patient-typed agenda:
“1. Lumps on my lungs 
2. my ankle is not getting better 
3. the boot is giving me knee problems”
Clinician’s comments on the above patient-typed agenda:
“My patient typed ‘lumps on lungs’. This was a pulmonary nodule 
identified on a CT scan in the ER that I might have missed if he 
had not put it on his agenda. While the nodule was incidental, the 
patient was anxious about the finding and I was able to provide 
reassurance.”
B. Examples of Patients’ and Clinicians’ Responses 
from the Follow-up Survey
Patients’ comments from the follow-up survey
• “Helps me remember what I am being seen for”
• “Gave doctor my information so I wouldn’t be nervous  
and forget”
• “Doctor and I on same page”
• “Made me think about reasons for visit before seeing doctor”
• “New doctor so this was excellent way of getting my feelings 
across”
Clinicians’ comments from the follow-up survey
• “Got time to think about issues ahead of time”
• “Engaged patient to participate more in the visit, he felt ‘heard’”

The patient cogeneration of visit notes, facilitated 
by new EMR functionality, reflects a shift in the 
authorship and “ownership” of visit notes. Patient-
written visit agendas could increase the collaborative 
nature of the clinical encounter between patient and 
clinician, but require further study, including measure-
ment of patient engagement and health outcomes.
