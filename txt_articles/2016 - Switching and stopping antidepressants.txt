Switching and stopping antidepressants
SUMMARY
Switching from one antidepressant to another is frequently indicated due to an inadequate 
treatment response or unacceptable adverse effects. All antidepressant switches must be carried 
out cautiously and under close observation.
Conservative switching strategies involve gradually tapering the first antidepressant followed by 
an adequate washout period before the new antidepressant is started. This can take a long time 
and include periods of no treatment with the risk of potentially life-threatening exacerbations 
of illness.
Clinical expertise is needed for more rapid or cross-taper switching as drug toxicity, including 
serotonin syndrome, may result from inappropriate co-administration of antidepressants. Some 
antidepressants must not be combined.
Antidepressants can cause withdrawal syndromes if discontinued abruptly after prolonged use. 
Relapse and exacerbation of depression can also occur. Gradual dose reduction over days to 
weeks reduces the risk and severity of complications.
antidepressants soon after starting and many more 
only partially adhere to treatment.6
Withdrawing antidepressants
If used for longer than six weeks, all antidepressants 
have the potential to cause withdrawal syndromes if 
they are stopped or rapidly reduced (with the possible 
exception of agomelatine). As a result many patients 
believe that antidepressants are addictive. This is not 
the case as abusive and compulsive use, tolerance and 
drug seeking do not occur with antidepressant drugs. 
Withdrawal syndromes occur with many drugs (such 
as corticosteroids) when used long term.
The usual recommended period for antidepressant 
dose reduction is a minimum of four weeks.2 However, 
abrupt cessation may at times be unavoidable on 
clinical grounds. The time frame for dose reduction 
also depends on individual risk for withdrawal 
symptoms, patient preference and experience during 
withdrawal, and drug characteristics such as half-life 
(Table 1).
Previous withdrawal symptoms and anxiety when 
starting antidepressant treatment are predictors 
of future discontinuation problems. Some patients 
experience little discomfort despite abrupt cessation, 
while others are severely affected. In a minority, 
withdrawal symptoms are not diminished by 
extending the duration of dose taper. These patients 
may prefer rapid cessation and a briefer withdrawal 
period. Many will not experience symptoms in the 
early part of withdrawal (which could proceed 
more rapidly) but develop severe symptoms in the 
Introduction
Antidepressant drugs are indicated for the treatment 
of depression, anxiety disorders (including panic and 
social phobia), obsessive compulsive disorder and 
post-traumatic stress disorder. There are over 20 
antidepressants currently available in Australia. These 
can be divided into 13 clinically relevant groups, which 
differ substantially in their pharmacodynamic and 
pharmacokinetic characteristics.
Up to two-thirds of patients with major depression 
fail to respond to their first antidepressant drug. After 
assuring correct diagnosis, optimal dose, duration and 
adherence to treatment, a change of antidepressant 
drug is indicated.1 A patient is unlikely to respond if 
there has been no improvement after three to four 
weeks on an adequate dose of antidepressant.2 
About a quarter of patients switched to a second 
antidepressant can be expected to achieve remission.3 
There is no evidence that switching between classes 
of antidepressants is more effective than switching 
within a class.4 Unacceptable adverse effects from 
antidepressants, such as sexual dysfunction and 
weight gain, may also necessitate a change of 
therapy.5 Switching from one antidepressant to 
another is a common clinical challenge.
Withdrawal of an antidepressant is also indicated after 
an episode of depression has been adequately treated 
- usually six to nine months after recovery from a 
single episode. Serious physical illness, pregnancy 
and surgery may also be reasons for stopping 
antidepressant therapy. Up to a third of patients stop

first antidepressant to minimise withdrawal symptoms 
then start a washout period equivalent to five half-
lives of the drug (Table 1). This does not apply to 
irreversible monoamine oxidase inhibitors where a 
specified long period of washout is mandatory (see 
Table 3). Five half-lives equates to about five days 
for most SSRIs except fluoxetine, which can still be 
significantly active five or more weeks after cessation. 
The second antidepressant is then introduced 
according to the starting dose recommendations.
later stages (when dose reduction may need to be 
more gradual).
Withdrawal symptoms
Withdrawal symptoms generally begin within 
hours to days of dose reduction, depending on the 
characteristics of the particular drug.7 Withdrawing 
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and 
serotonin noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) 
tends to cause flu-like symptoms, nausea, lethargy, 
dizziness, ataxia, ‘electric shock’ sensations, anxiety, 
irritability, insomnia and vivid dreams. The symptoms 
can be extremely disabling for some patients.
Venlafaxine is associated with the most severe 
withdrawal effects. Paroxetine is also troublesome 
while fluoxetine rarely causes withdrawal symptoms 
(especially if the dose is under 40 mg) due to the long 
half-life of the parent drug and its active metabolite 
(about 7 days). Withdrawal of tricyclic antidepressants 
can cause nausea, headache, abdominal pain, 
diarrhoea, lethargy, anxiety, insomnia and vivid 
dreams. It is unlikely that withdrawal symptoms will 
occur after cessation of low-dose tricyclics used in 
pain treatment. Withdrawing irreversible monoamine 
oxidase inhibitors such as tranylcypromine is 
particularly troublesome. It often causes agitation, 
irritability, mood disorders, dreams, cognitive 
impairment and occasionally psychosis and delirium.
Relapse and exacerbation
Stopping antidepressants can also result in relapse 
or exacerbation of the psychiatric illness. Relapse 
of depressive symptoms (including suicidal ideation 
and self-harm) and recurrence of panic attacks and 
severe anxiety can all occur with dose reduction 
and cessation. Such exacerbations can cause life-
threatening behaviours in high-risk patients, and 
antidepressant withdrawal must be a carefully 
considered decision made by the well-informed 
patient, often their family, and the prescriber. Avoid 
stopping an antidepressant abruptly - withdrawal 
over weeks to months (if possible) reduces the risk 
of relapse.2
Switching strategies
A number of strategies are available for switching 
between antidepressants (Table 2).6,8 Close 
clinical observation and caution is required with 
all approaches, as some patients may respond 
idiosyncratically and serious complications can 
occur. Individual patient factors and illness factors 
may require considerable modification of a 
switching strategy.
The most conservative strategy, with the lowest risk of 
drug interactions, is to gradually taper the dose of the

Switching and stopping antidepressants
there will be a considerable risk of withdrawal 
symptoms and drug interactions. A cross-taper 
strategy, where the first antidepressant dose is 
reduced while the second antidepressant is introduced 
at a low dose and gradually increased, can be done 
safely with only some antidepressants (Table 3).
Switching between specific 
antidepressants
Table 3 lists generalised guidelines for switching 
patients from one antidepressant to another.2, 8-10 The 
recommendations are applicable to any switching 
strategy. Circumstances where only a conservative 
strategy can be used are identified. Table 3 also states 
when antidepressants should not be co-administered 
or tapered at the same time.
Serotonin syndrome
As many antidepressants have serotonergic activity, 
serotonin syndrome can occur during antidepressant 
switching. While the syndrome may cause mild 
The dose is usually tapered over four weeks, similar 
to the minimum period required for antidepressant 
discontinuation. However, the time frame may need to 
be modified depending on patient factors.
As the conservative switch can take quite a long time 
and usually includes at least several days where the 
patient is not on an antidepressant, a compromise 
strategy is the moderate switch. Here the washout 
period can generally be shortened to about two days. 
The risk of drug interactions is increased with this 
approach, but is still quite low. The conservative and 
moderate switch techniques are both suitable for 
general practice.
Direct and cross-taper switch methods can also be 
used but considerable expertise is necessary (Table 2). 
Some patients will require admission to hospital. A 
direct switch – one drug is stopped and another drug 
is commenced the next day at the usual therapeutic 
dose – can be used when switching between some 
SSRIs, SNRIs and tricyclic antidepressants. However, 
Table 2    
Techniques for switching from one antidepressant to another 6
Method
Comment
Conservative switch:
• the first antidepressant is gradually reduced and stopped
• there follows a drug-free washout interval of five half-lives 
of the first antidepressant
• the new antidepressant is started according to its dose 
recommendation
Most appropriate for general practice. The risk of drug 
interactions is very low but discontinuation symptoms 
may occur.
Moderate switch:
• the first antidepressant is gradually reduced and stopped
• there follows a drug-free washout interval of 2–4 days
• the new antidepressant is started at a low dose
Also recommended for use in general practice. The risk 
of drug interactions is low but discontinuation symptoms 
may occur.
Direct switch:
• the first antidepressant is stopped
• the second antidepressant is started the next day at the 
usual therapeutic dose
Quick and simple but discontinuation symptoms are likely 
depending on the second antidepressant. The risk of 
drug interactions is substantial, depending on the second 
antidepressant. Method requires clinical expertise and is 
only feasible in selected instances, such as swapping from 
one short half-life SSRI to another.
Cross-taper switch:
• the first antidepressant is gradually reduced and stopped
• the second antidepressant is introduced at a low dose at 
some stage during the reduction of the first antidepressant, 
so that the patient is taking both antidepressants 
simultaneously
• the dose of the second antidepressant is increased to 
the therapeutic dose when the first antidepressant has 
been stopped
Frequently used for patients with high risk from illness 
relapse but there is risk of drug interactions and increased 
adverse effects from combined medications. Only feasible 
in selected instances. Requires clinical expertise.
Note: Above strategies do not apply to monamine oxidase inhibitors, for which strict recommendations must be followed

tricyclic antidepressant due to inhibition of tricyclic 
antidepressant metabolism by fluoxetine. Early signs 
of tricyclic antidepressant toxicity include drowsiness, 
tachycardia and postural hypotension.
When changing from irreversible monoamine oxidase 
inhibitors (phenelzine and tranylcypromine) to all 
other antidepressants, with the possible exception of 
agomelatine, an adequate washout of two to three 
weeks is mandatory.
Conclusion
Switching antidepressants involves drug cessation, 
which may cause withdrawal symptoms and relapse 
or exacerbation of the psychiatric illness. Gradual 
antidepressant withdrawal reduces the risk of 
complications. If the washout period is not long 
enough (defined by half-life of the drug), introducing 
a new antidepressant can cause drug interactions 
leading to toxicity, particularly serotonin syndrome. 
Switching from one antidepressant to another 
requires careful observation and caution. 
Conflict of interest: none declared
symptoms such as nervousness, agitation, tremor, 
diaphoresis, shivering, mydriasis, hyperreflexia 
and diarrhoea, in more severe cases tachycardia, 
hyperthermia, hypertension, myoclonus, muscular 
rigidity and delirium can occur. Convulsions, organ 
system failure and death may follow. Prevention 
through minimising interactions between potent 
serotonergic drugs is critical.11
The only significant interaction for agomelatine is 
with fluvoxamine (Table 3). Vortioxetine (an SSRI with 
possible other serotonergic effects) can interact with 
a variety of antidepressants. Caution is required for 
switching and the prescriber should consult relevant 
drug information before proceeding. The same 
caution applies to duloxetine (Table 3).
Fluoxetine is a particular challenge for switching 
because of its long half-life. Serotonin syndrome can 
occur if clomipramine, fluvoxamine or monoamine 
oxidase inhibitors are introduced before an adequate 
washout of fluoxetine, which can take five or more 
weeks. Tricyclic antidepressants can be introduced 
at a low dose after fluoxetine withdrawal. However, 
the low dose needs to be continued for several 
weeks to avoid cardiotoxic plasma concentrations of

Taper means gradual dose reduction, with lowering by increments every few days, usually over a period of 4 weeks, modified by patient experience, 
drug, illness and other factors.
All switches from one antidepressant to another may result in serious complications. Switches must be undertaken cautiously and under close observation.
The recommendations in this table are based on clinical experience, product information, empirical evidence and recommendations from other 
guidelines. It may be necessary to modify the switching process depending on patient, illness and interacting drug variables, determined by the patient’s 
clinical progress. In appropriate circumstances expert prescribers may use less conservative switch strategies if justified by harm–benefit considerations 
arising from factors such as illness severity.

A washout period of 2–5 half-lives (most frequently 2–5 days) between cessation of previous drug and the introduction of a new drug is the safest 
switching strategy from the point of view of drug interactions. In the indicated instances a washout period is not essential if switching is carried out 
cautiously and under close observation, and clinical considerations such as illness severity support harm–benefit considerations. Cautious cross taper 
(when the dose of the first drug is being reduced and the dose of the second drug is being increased at the same time so that the patient is taking 
both antidepressants) may be used in the indicated instances if appropriate and safe.
† 
 
Fluoxetine may still cause interactions 5 or 6 weeks after cessation (especially from higher doses) due to long half-life of drug and active metabolite.
‡ 
 
Fluoxetine is likely to continue to elevate TCA concentrations for several weeks.
§ 
 
Co-prescription of the two antidepressants in this instance is not recommended.
