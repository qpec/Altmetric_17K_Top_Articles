Vitamin B12 status in older adults living in Ontario long-term
care homes: prevalence and incidence of deficiency with
supplementation as a protective factor
Kaylen J. Pfisterer, Mike T. Sharratt, George G. Heckman, and Heather H. Keller
Abstract: Vitamin B12 (B12) deficiency, although treatable, impacts up to 43% of community-living older adults; long-term care
(LTC) residents may be at greater risk. Recommendations for screening require further evidence on prevalence and incidence in
LTC. Small, ungeneralizable samples provide a limited perspective on these issues. The purposes of this study were to report
prevalence of B12 deficiency at admission to LTC, incidence 1 year post-admission, and identify subgroups with differential risk.
This multi-site (8), retrospective prevalence study used random proportionate sampling of resident charts (n = 412). Data at
admission extracted included demographics, B12 status, B12 supplementation, medications, diagnoses, functional indepen-
dence, cognitive performance, and nutrition. Prevalence at admission of B12 deficiency (<156 pmol/L) was 13.8%; 47.6% had
normal B12 (>300 pmol/L). One year post-admission incidence was 4%. Better B12 status was significantly associated with
supplementation use prior to LTC admission. Other characteristics were not associated with status. This work provides a better
estimate of B12 deficiency prevalence than previously available for LTC, upon which to base protocols and policy. Prospective
studies are needed to establish treatment efficacy and effect on health related outcomes.

Introduction
Up to 70% of older adults (≥65 years) living in long-term care
(LTC) homes are at risk for undernutrition (Wouters-Wesseling
et al. 2002; Isenring et al. 2012), which can lead to mortality and
morbidity (Pirlich and Lochs 2001). Micronutrient malnutrition
exists and is poorly studied in LTC older adults (Lam et al. 2015a,
2015b). Vitamin B12 (B12) is a nutrient of special concern in this
population because of age-related decreased absorptive ability
(Russell 2000; Morley and Thomas 2007) and polypharmacy
(Bronskill et al. 2012); absorption of this nutrient is commonly
affected by drug interactions (Raats et al. 2008). B12 deficiency
leads to hematologic and neurologic abnormalities and is treat-
able (Baker et al. 1980; Baik and Russell 1999; Andrès et al. 2004).
Screening for B12 status at admission to LTC may be a worth-
while process. While little work has been done in LTC, community-
living older adult prevalence estimates of B12 deficiency range
from 3%–43% (Lindenbaum et al. 1994; Andrès et al. 2004; Pfeiffer
et al. 2005). Physically and cognitively dependent older adults
(Matteini et al. 2008) may be at increased risk. However, decision
for widespread screening relies on multiple factors, including im-
pact of diagnosis on clinical outcomes, required follow-up time,
screening and treatment effectiveness for improved health out-
comes, and cost of screening (Sackett et al. 1991). This knowledge
for B12 is currently lacking. Only 4 studies of the LTC population
in the past decade have reported B12 deficiency prevalence from
8%–34% (Paulionis et al. 2005; Lin et al. 2009; Gharaibeh et al. 2010;
Mirkazemi et al. 2012), none of which considered prevalence of
deficiency at admission or incidence after admission to LTC. Fur-
thermore, generalizability of these studies is limited because of a
small sample size (Lin et al. 2009) or unclear group allocation and

 extensive exclusion criteria resulting in a potentially biased sam-
ple (Gharaibeh et al. 2010). Work aimed at addressing prevalence
of B12 deficiency and change of B12 status in LTC is needed to
inform future recommendations.
This concept of at admission to LTC is particularly noteworthy in
this population as persons receiving transitional care are generally
more vulnerable because of the stress and anxiety of relocation
(Wilson 1997); the potential for breakdown in communication on
medication and other treatments that are not incorporated into
the resident’
s care plan post-admission (Coleman 2003); and
change in primary physician care for the resident. As a result, B12
treatment started in the community (especially intramuscular
modality, which is normally provided on a monthly basis, typi-
cally in a doctor’
s office), may be overlooked and lost as a compo-
nent of the resident’
s care plan. While understanding prevalence
at admission to LTC is a first step for determining if standardized
screening and treatment protocols are required, understanding
incidence provides insight into how B12 status changes with age,
other factors, and over time while living in residence.
The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of
B12 deficiency at admission to LTC. Secondary research aims were
to explore how admission B12 status and B12 levels are associated
with covariates of interest (e.g., supplementation use prior to ad-
mission), change in B12 status at 1 year post-admission, and
whether this change in status is associated with selected covari-
ates.
Materials and methods
This was a multi-site retrospective prevalence study conducted
in 8 Ontario LTC homes, within 1 organization (Schlegel Villages),
which had a policy for admission and annual B12 testing for all
residents. Based on a listing of all current residents over the age of
65 years (N = 1061), a minimum sample size of 319 was required
to detect a 5% prevalence of B12 deficiency at admission with
95% confidence (Naing et al. 2006). Random proportionate sam-
pling was used to identify the preliminary sample. To be included,
the randomly chosen resident had to have available admission B12
blood work on their physical chart. Randomly selected residents
with unavailable admission blood work were replaced with the
next randomly selected, eligible (>65 years) resident. Nine hun-
dred and forty-six resident charts were reviewed to attain the final
412 residents with accessible admission blood work. Missing
blood work was a result of culling of the physical chart or re-filing
of this form by site staff.
A data extraction form was created, reviewed by the research
team, and tested for feasibility in 30 charts. The first author con-
ducted all chart reviews. The following data were extracted: de-
mographics (e.g., sex, age, length of stay); admission serum B12
levels; number of medications; number of diagnoses, and specifi-
cally noting the presence of cardiovascular disease, dementia,
Alzheimer’
s-type dementia, hypothyroidism, gastrointestinal condi-
tions, and mood conditions. The following additional variables
were included from the Minimum Data Set: cognitive perfor-
mance scale score, activities of daily living score, weight and
height to calculate body mass index (BMI), nutritional problems,
and weight change. Three biologically implausible BMI values
were removed in accordance with prior work (Keller and Hirdes
2000), assuming invalid data entry. Where available, first annual
lab results were reviewed for B12 level at 1 year post-admission.
Because of differences in the cut-points used to define B12 defi-
ciency at different homes, this study defined B12 status as defi-
ciency, subclinical, and normal status based on the authors’
previous work: <156 pmol/L, 156–300 pmol/L, and >300 pmol/L,1
respectively. Excepting admission serum B12 level, missing values
were permissible; thus, proportions of missing data varied across
covariates.
Data were analyzed using IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows
(version 23.0; IBM Corp., Armonk, N.Y., USA) and cleaned using
frequencies, descriptive analyses, and graphing. ANOVA were con-
ducted for B12 values and categorical variables. Where appropriate,
the Tukey B test was used to establish between group differences
(Norman and Streiner 2008). �2 tests were used to determine associ-
ations between categorical variables. Paired t tests were conducted
for all admission and first annual bloodwork comparisons. The sig-
nificance level used was p ≤ 0.01 to account for multiple tests. A
2-proportion z test was used to establish whether the proportionate
samples were significantly different than the planned sample pro-
portions using a significance level of p < 0.05 (Berman 2015). This
study was reviewed and approved by the University of Waterloo’
s
Office of Research Ethics.
Results
The proportion of charts included from each village did not
differ significantly from the proportion of residents (p > 0.05).
However, the number of alternatives needed to reach sufficient
inclusion from each village ranged between 4 to 99 charts with a
mean and median of 67 and 72, respectively.
Of the 412 reviewed charts, 286 (69%) of residents were female.
The mean age at admission was 83 ± 7 years (range: 65–101 years).
The mean, standard deviation, and mode for length of stay from
admission to date of data collection were 22 ± 20 months and
9 months respectively. The most recent admission and longest
length of stay between admission and data collection was
1 month and 11.2 years, respectively. The mean number of admit-
ting diagnoses and medications was 6.05 (SD 2.73, range: 1–18) and
10 (SD 4.5, range: 0–28), respectively. After the removal of 3 incon-
ceivable values, the average BMI in this sample was 28.18 (SD 6.58,
range: 13.22–60.59). When BMI was grouped categorically, 6.7% of
residents had a low BMI (<20), 58.1% had a normal BMI (20–30), and
35.2% had a high BMI (>30).
At admission to LTC, overall prevalence of B12 deficiency
(<156 pmol/L) was 13.8% (57/412), subclinical deficiency (156–
300 pmol/L) was 38.3% (158/412), and 47.6% (197/412) of residents
had a normal B12 status (>300 pmol/L). The mean serum B12 level
at admission was 358.3 ± 229.3 pmol/L. While prevalence of B12
deficiency across sites ranged from 4.1% to 27.1%, these differences
were not significant (p > 0.01); for prevalence estimates using
common lab-defined cut-points, see Table 1.
B12 supplementation use at admission to LTC was significantly
associated with higher admission serum B12 (p < 0.001; �2 = 60.784
(df = 2)) (Table 1). A significantly (p < 0.001) smaller proportion of
residents receiving B12 at admission had deficient B12 status (2.3%
vs 18.4%) and a larger proportion had normal B12 status compared
with those not receiving B12 (84.1% vs 36.0%). The type of B12
supplementation method at admission approached significance
with B12 status (p = 0.012; F = 11.620). Compared with those receiv-
ing intramuscular (IM) B12, those receiving oral B12 had a higher
proportion of normal B12 status (90% oral vs 57% IM), and lower
proportions of subclinical B12 status (8.5% oral vs 35.7% IM) and
deficient B12 status (1.4% oral vs 7.1% IM). No other covariates were
associated with B12 status at admission.
Based on the subsample of charts with first annual B12 recorded
(40%, 163/412), prevalence of B12 deficiency at 1 year post-admission
was 7.0% (10/142); incidence of new B12 deficiency cases in this
timeframe was 4.2% (6/142). Within this subsample, B12 status was
significantly improved at first annual bloodwork compared with

 admission (p < 0.001; F = 25.6). Specifically, the majority of resi-
dents initially with B12 deficiency with year 1 data (n = 16) had
improved B12 status after 1 year (75%); 25% improved to subclinical
deficiency, while 50% improved to normal.
Discussion
The variation in prevalence (14% overall, range: 4.1%–27%) across
the 8 sites demonstrates the importance of assessing multiple
sites to determine an improved representative estimate of preva-

 lence. This range of estimates is within that of both community
estimates (3%–43%) (Lindenbaum et al. 1994; Andrès et al. 2004;
Pfeiffer et al. 2005) and the few studies conducted in LTC (8%–34%)
(Paulionis et al. 2005; Lin et al. 2009; Gharaibeh et al. 2010;
Mirkazemi et al. 2012). It is important to note that point preva-
lence estimates of B12 deficiency at admission (14%) and at 1 year
post-admission (7%) likely underestimate the true proportion of
residents impacted by metabolic changes associated with inade-
quate B12 status. A 2003 review summarized evidence to suggest
that a functional deficit may be present at B12 levels under
332 pmol/L (400 ng/mL) and that approximately 15% of older adults
with apparent normal B12 levels have evidence of metabolic ab-
normality (Grober et al. 2013).
A 4% incidence of B12 deficiency indicates that B12 status is a
relevant form of malnutrition in this population. Yet, the present
study provides evidence that B12 status is amenable to treatment,
which is consistent with extant literature on intervention studies
(Baker et al. 1980; Wouters-Wesseling et al. 2002; Grieger et al.
2009; Rozgony et al. 2010; Favrat et al. 2011). Whether this remains
true for older adults after admission to LTC remains unknown and
further evidence for burden of illness and establishing causality of
improved B12 status on clinical outcomes is warranted. Lack of cova-
riates associated with prevalence suggests that targeted screening at
admission is not appropriate.
Inclusion of 8 sites resulted in a large sample with potentially
greater diversity than previously reported LTC research. Random
sampling was used with excellent representation of eligible resi-
dents (37%). This study reports on prevalence of B12 deficiency at
admission to LTC (14%), at 1 year post-admission (7.0%) as well as
incidence (4%) providing a point for comparison for future studies
designed to specifically address incidence and associated covari-
ates. A limitation was the high proportion of missing data on the
first annual follow-up. This subsample was likely biased. Yet, this
is the first study to report on how B12 status changes over the first
year of residence in LTC and as such adds new knowledge to the
field. Future work to inform policy, intervention, and screening
protocols should use prospective methods focusing on fidelity to
treatment protocols, burden of illness, as well as to determine
incident B12 deficiency in LTC and characteristics of residents that
result in these outcomes.
