Abstract
 Background—The primary objective of this gender-stratified study was to assess the rate of 
heavy alcohol use among suicide decedents relative to a nonsuicide comparison group during the 
2008-09 economic crisis.
 Methods—The National Violent Death Reporting System and the Behavioral Risk Factor 
Surveillance System were analyzed by gender-stratified multiple logistic regression to test whether 
change in acute intoxication (blood alcohol content ≥ 0.08 g/dl) before (2005-07), during 
(2008-09), and after (2010-11) the Great Recession mirrored change in heavy alcohol use in a 
living sample.
 Results—Among men, suicide decedents experienced a significantly greater increase (+8%) in 
heavy alcohol use at the onset of the recession (AOR=1.15, 95% confidence interval 
[CI]=1.10-1.20) (relative to the pre-recession period) than did men in a nonsuicide comparison 
group (−2%). Among women, changes in rates of heavy alcohol use were similar in the suicide 
and nonsuicide comparison groups at the onset and after the recession.
 Conclusions—Acute alcohol use contributed to suicide among men during the recent 
economic downturn. Among women who died by suicide, acute alcohol use mirrored consumption

 INTRODUCTION
The world economy contracted sharply during 2008 and 2009. As mentioned in our previous 
research (Kaplan et al., 2015), although there is considerable evidence regarding the impact 
of contracting economies- especially levels of unemployment- on suicide mortality risk 
(Barr et al., 2012; Brenner,1973; Luo et al., 2011; Maki and Martikainen, 2012; Phillips and 
Nugent, 2014), less is known about the role heavy alcohol consumption plays in the link 
between the economic conditions and suicide risk. Caan (2009) suggested that alcohol use 
could be the missing link between unemploymentand suicide.
In the general population, economic recessions have been associated with declines in overall 
alcohol consumption (LaVallee and Yi, 2012, Ruhm and Black, 2002) as well as with 
increases in heavy alcohol use and related problems, particularly among those directly 
affected by the contraction (Davalos et al., 2012). This overall increase in high-risk drinking 
or heavy alcohol use (as defined below) during the 2008-09 economic crisis might explain 
the rise in alcohol-related suicides during a period when overall alcohol use declined.
Results from the literature show that the fraction of suicide decedents who were intoxicated 
increased during the recent economic contraction, with most demographic (age, gender, and 
racial/ethnic) groups adversely impacted (Kaplan et al., 2015). Male suicide decedents 
showed increased risk of alcohol intoxication within the first 2 years of the recession, 
whereas there was a lag effect among female suicide decedents, who had increased risk of 
intoxication in 2010-11. Equally important was that the increase in the prevalence of 
alcohol-involvement in suicides exceeded the rise in the overall suicide rate in the United 
States during the 2008-09 recession (Kaplan et al., 2015)
To address the issue of the contribution of alcohol to suicide during the 2008-09 economic 
crisis, this study used a natural experiment that capitalized on the U.S. National Violent 
Death Reporting System (NVDRS) and supplemented with data from the Behavioral Risk 
Factors Surveillance System (BRFSS) to ascertain the relative risk of acute alcohol use and 
intoxication among male and female suicide decedents during the recent economic 
recession.
 MATERIALS AND METHODS
 Study populations
Data for suicide decedents ages 20 years and older were obtained from the NVDRS. The 
NVDRS is a unique active surveillance system that provides detailed accounts of violent 
deaths that occur in the participating U.S. states (Karch et al., 2012). As of 2005, 16 states 
(Alaska, Colorado, Georgia, Kentucky, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New Mexico, 
Kaplan et al.

 North Carolina, Oklahoma, Oregon, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Utah, Virginia, and 
Wisconsin) contributed data to the NVDRS. These analyses were restricted to 2005-11 
period using the 16 states. The data were gathered from coroner/medical examiner (C/ME) 
records, police reports, death certificates, and crime laboratories (including postmortem 
toxicology information).
Suicide decedents were identified as those with death certificates that listed International 
Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, codes X60-84 or Y87.0 (World Health 
Organization, 1996). A detailed description of the sample characteristics appears elsewhere 
(Kaplan et al., 2013, Karch et al., 2012). Pooled 2005-11 NVDRS data yielded a total of 
65,908 suicide decedents, including those tested and not tested for alcohol.
 Nonsuicide comparison group
Subjects participating in the 2006-11 BRFSS were used as the comparison group. The 
BRFSS is conducted by states in coordination with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention and is designed to be both state and nationally representative (Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention, 2011). Computer-assisted telephone interviewing was used 
to assess binge drinking (hereafter referred to as “heavy alcohol use”). Respondents were 
asked, “Considering all types of alcoholic beverages, how many times during the past 30 
days did you have 5 (for men)/4 (for women) or more drinks on an occasion?” Those 
reporting at least one occasion were considered heavy drinkers, whereas abstainers, non-
monthly drinkers, and non-heavy drinkers were considered non-heavy users.
The BRFSS was chosen because state-specific data were available and the analysis could be 
restricted to the 16 states in the NVDRS. The 2005 BRFSS was not included because there 
was a change in the definition of binge drinking for women, reducing the threshold from 5 
or more drinks to 4 or more drinks in a day. The pooled 2006-11 BRFSS in the 16 NVDRS 
states yielded 811,832 respondents aged 20 years and older. The objective of this study was 
to compare the change in heavy alcohol use over time in the suicide and nonsuicide samples. 
Thus, the alcohol consumption measures allow for comparison of population drinking 
patterns over time. Of course, the baseline and follow-up measures do not pertain to the 
same individuals. Nonetheless, the comparability over time in the identification of heavy 
occasions can be employed to evaluate relative changes in heavy drinking between 
decedents and living subjects during the economic crisis.
 Study variables
For the NVDRS sample, the main dependent variable in the analysis was a blood alcohol 
concentration (BAC) at or above the legal limit for intoxication while driving in the United 
States (BAC ≥ 0.08 g/dl) versus below the limit (BAC < 0.08 g/dl) (US Department of 
Transportation, 2015) at the time of death. The BAC variable is part of the C/ME 
toxicological investigation. In the 16 states studied, 69% of male (n = 35,355) and 73% of 
female (n = 10,427) suicide decedents were tested for alcohol.
BAC levels were first coded as a continuous measure in terms of weight by volume, and then 
classified as < 0.08 g/dl or ≥ 0.08 g/dl (National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, 
Kaplan et al.

 n.d.). To determine the effect of a higher cutoff point, a sensitivity analysis was performed 
using BAC ≥ 0.12 g/dl (data not shown), yielding similar results.
Sociodemographic variables, obtained from death certificates or interviews, included gender, 
age group (20-44, 45-64, and 65 years and older), and race/ethnicity (white, Black, 
American Indian/Alaska Native [AI/AN], Asian/Pacific Islander [Asian/PI], and Hispanic). 
Educational attainment, a measure of socioeconomic status, was classified as less than 12 
years, 12 years or more, and a “missing” category (which was added to control for the 
effects of missing information). Economic contraction periods were defined as 2005-07 
(before the economic downturn), 2008-09 (during the downturn), and 2010-11 (after the 
downturn). The pre-recession years were pooled as baseline to maximize statistical power. 
Mental health status in the BRFSS refers to participants who reported 14 or more days 
(Moriarty et al., 2003) in response to the following question: “Now thinking about your 
mental health, which includes stress, depression, and problems with emotions, for how many 
days during the past 30 days was your mental health not good?” In the NVDRS, decedents 
with mental health problems were those with evidence of being depressed at the time of 
death and/or evidence of a mental illness diagnosis. Ethics approval for the study was 
obtained from the Institutional Review Board at the University of California, Los Angeles.
 Statistical methods
The fraction of decedents with a BAC ≥ 0.08 g/dl and the fraction of interview respondents 
with heavy alcohol use were estimated prior to, during, and after the downturn. Hereafter, 
decedents with BAC ≥ 0.08 or living subjects classified as heavy drinkers are referred to as 
“heavy alcohol users.”
Logistic regression models tested whether there was a difference between the NVDRS 
decedents and BRFSS sample in changes in the proportion of subjects classified as heavy 
alcohol users as measured before the economic crisis versus during and after the crisis. 
Models were stratified by gender, age, and race/ethnicity. The dependent variable was heavy 
alcohol use. Interaction terms between economic contraction periods (with 2005-07 as the 
referent category) and vital status (suicide versus nonsuicide as the referent) were included 
in the models to test whether the change in consumption varied among decedents relative to 
living comparison subjects (estimates are ratios of odds ratios). Models controlled for state 
of residence, educational attainment, and mental health problems. Estimates and standard 
errors were weighted to reflect the BRFSS complex sampling design and adjusted for 
nonresponse and poststratification using SAS Proc Surveylogistic (SAS Industries Inc., 
Cary, NC). In the analyses, weights, response, and poststratification parameters for NVDRS 
were constructed to reflect complete data.
 RESULTS
Numbers of cases by characteristics, economic contraction periods, and vital status appear in 
Table 1. Rates of heavy alcohol use in the living sample and alcohol intoxication (BAC ≥ 
0.08 g/dl) among suicide decedents during the study years appear in Table 2. Results show 
that among males in the living sample heavy alcohol use decreased by 2% during the 
downturn for most age and race/ethnic groups, but then increased by 12% in 2010-11

 relative to 2008-09. For female living subjects, there was a small rise during the recession 
and then a larger increase after the recession. The prevalence of alcohol involvement in 
suicides increased for both genders and most age and race/ethnic groups. The increase 
occurred during the recession (2008-09) for male suicide decedents. Of note, annual 
numbers of male suicides increased from 4,869 to 5,209 or 340 deaths per year. The rise in 
heavy drinking among male suicide decedents could account for roughly 44 deaths per year 
among men in the NVDRS states. The increase was delayed until after the recession 
(2010-11) for female suicide decedents.
Table 3 presents interaction terms between vital status (suicide versus nonsuicide) and 
economic contraction periods. The logistic regression models showed that male suicide 
decedents experienced a significantly greater increase than living men in heavy alcohol use 
at the onset of the recession (relative to the pre-recession period). This finding was observed 
among males in all age categories and in all race/ethnic groups except for Asian/PI men (for 
whom the interaction term was not statistically significant).
Overall for women, there was no statistically significant difference in the change in heavy 
alcohol use both at the onset and after the downturn between the living sample and the 
suicide cases. However, older and Hispanic female suicide decedents were more likely than 
their living counterparts to be classified as heavy alcohol users at the onset of economic 
downturn.
 DISCUSSION
Heavy alcohol use rose during the 2008-09 economic contraction and may have been a 
notable risk factor for suicide. Results for men show that alcohol involvement increased 
among decedents beyond the general population increase in heavy drinking, emphasizing the 
heightened importance of acute alcohol use as a risk factor for suicide among men during 
economic crises. The present study suggests that men may be at a heightened risk for 
alcohol-related suicide during economic contraction.
Creative alcohol control policies might reduce this risk. Several control measures have been 
shown to reduce alcohol-related harm and are relevant to curtailing alcohol-related suicide 
(Babor et al., 2010, Cook, 2007). For example, there are public health benefits from policies 
related to alcohol pricing, such as raising taxes (Cook, 2007), raising minimum (floor) prices 
(Stockwell et al., 2012), and pricing beverages according to alcohol content (i.e., 
concentrations of ethanol). Long hours of sale and high density of alcohol outlets 
(Giesbrecht et al., 2015, Popova et al., 2009), indicating easy access to alcohol, also may be 
important, if impulsive buying contributes to suicide during economic downturns.
Not only are alcohol control policies important, but equally so is investing in the public 
health and social welfare infrastructure to minimize the adverse effects of future economic 
downturns such as high unemployment and associated material deprivation (Cylus et al., 
2014). For example, Scandinavian countries averted public health problems experienced by 
other countries (such as the United States) via generous social protection that de-escalated 
the health and social effects of the recent global economic shock (Norstrom and Gronqvist, 
Kaplan et al.

 2015). More specifically, Sweden exhibited no marked increase in total suicide rates during 
the global 2008-09 economic crisis (Reeves et al., 2014). Three factors may have contributed 
to mental health resilience during the economic recession in Sweden. First, effective mental 
health treatment may have moderated the impact of the economic shocks on suicide by 
controlling depression associated with financial uncertainty. Second, active labor market 
programs may have helped the unemployed find work while providing other forms of 
support. Third, greater gender equality in the workplace may have attenuated the mental 
heath risks of the economic shock.
Women appeared to be less vulnerable than men to the combined effects of heavy alcohol 
use and economic contraction. A recent epidemiological analysis suggests that stronger 
social network structures among women may have buffered them against the adverse 
interaction of drinking and financial distress (Tsai et al., 2015). On the other hand, previous 
work (Kaplan et al., 2014) has suggested that acute alcohol intoxication is an even greater 
suicide risk factor for women than for men. Perhaps during the economic contraction there 
was a ceiling effect, in that women were already at maximal suicide risk from heavy alcohol 
use.
These findings need to be considered in light of some data limitations. First, postmortem 
toxicology testing rates varied across the NVDRS states. Toxicology screening is often 
determined by availability of state funding. Unfortunately, current U.S. federal resources 
provided to the NVDRS states do not cover toxicological testing. However, all demographic 
subgroups had toxicological testing rates at or above a 65% level except those aged 60 years 
and older, whose testing rate was slightly lower (62%).
Second, NVDRS does not have information on the drinking patterns of the decedents while 
they were alive. It is conceivable that for some decedents this episode was their first time 
drinking heavily, perhaps in response to the economic crisis. Interestingly, there is evidence 
that individuals intoxicated at the time of death did not necessarily have a history of alcohol 
misuse prior to suicide (Kaplan et al., 2014).
Third, BRFSS has several well-known limitations, including low response rates, self-
reported data, and unspecified time frames regarding hours (durations) of drinking episodes 
(Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2011). However, the BRFSS may nonetheless 
accurately reflect time trends in heavy alcohol use (Nelson et al., 2010). For example, both 
the BRFSS and the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (United States Department of 
Health and Human Services et al., 2011), showed similar change in heavy alcohol use 
between 2005 and 2011 (data not shown).
Taken as a whole, the findings suggest that during times of severe economic hardship, acute 
alcohol intoxication among male suicide decedents (unlike that for their female 
counterparts) exceeded the heavy alcohol use observed in a nonsuicide comparison group. 
The combination of alcohol intoxication and the economic downturn was a noteworthy 
suicide risk factor for men. Further research is needed to identify factors associated with 
increased use of alcohol among men who may be vulnerable to the psychological distress 
associated with economic hardship.
