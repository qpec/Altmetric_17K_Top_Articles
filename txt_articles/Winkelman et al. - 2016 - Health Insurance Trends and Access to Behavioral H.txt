BACKGROUND: A large proportion of justice-involved
individuals have mental health issues and substance use
disorders (SUD) that are often untreated due to high rates
of uninsurance. However, roughly half of justice-involved
individuals were estimated to be newly eligible for health
insurance through the Affordable Care Act (ACA).
OBJECTIVE: We aimed to assess health insurance trends
among justice-involved individuals before and after imple-
mentation of the ACA’s key provisions, the dependent
coverage mandate and Medicaid expansion, and to exam-
ine the relationship between health insurance and treat-
ment for behavioral health conditions.
DESIGN: Repeated and pooled cross-sectional analyses of
data from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health
(NSDUH).
PARTICIPANTS: Nationally representative sample of
15,899 adults age 19–64 years between 2008 and 2014 with
a history of justice involvement during the prior 12 months.
MAIN MEASURES: Uninsurance rates between 2008 and
2014 are reported. Additional outcomes include adjusted
treatment rates for depression, serious mental illness,
and SUD by insurance status.
KEY RESULTS: The dependent coverage mandate was
associated with a 13.0 percentage point decline in unin-
surance among justice-involved individuals age 19–25
years (p < 0.001). Following Medicaid expansion, uninsur-
ance declined among justice involved individuals of all
ages by 9.7 percentage points (p < 0.001), but remained
16.3 percentage points higher than uninsurance rates for
individuals without justice involvement (p < 0.001). In
pooled analyses, Medicaid, relative to uninsurance and
private insurance, was associated with significantly
higher treatment rates for illicit drug abuse/dependence
and depression.
CONCLUSION: Given the high prevalence of mental ill-
ness and substance use disorders among justice-
involved populations, persistently elevated rates of unin-
surance and other barriers to care remain a significant
public health concern. Sustained outreach is required to
reduce health insurance disparities between individuals
with and without justice involvement. Public insurance
appears to be associated with higher treatment rates,
relative to uninsurance and private insurance, among
justice-involved individuals.
KEY WORDS: health policy; vulnerable populations; healthcare reform;

INTRODUCTION
Approximately 7 million individuals, 2.8 % of the adult pop-
ulation, are under correctional supervision on any given day in
the United States.1 Individuals currently or recently in prison
or jail, on probation or parole, or under arrest are often referred
to as justice-involved.2,3 Although most studies of justice-
involved individuals do not include all of these subgroups,
existing evidence suggests that approximately 70 % of justice-
involved individuals have a substance use disorder (SUD) or
mental health issue.4–7 Yet, treatment among individuals with
recent justice involvement has historically been inadequate
due to lack of health insurance coverage8–10 and other barriers
to care, including troubles navigating the healthcare system
post release,11 disruption of medication during incarceration,12
and lack of behavioral health services.13
Roughly half of justice-involved individuals are expected to
be eligible for health insurance through the Affordable Care
Act (ACA),10,14 and many believe insurance expansion offers
an opportunity to improve access to substance abuse and
mental health treatment for this population.5,14,15 One recent
report suggested that the ACA improved insurance rates
among justice-involved individuals with SUD.16 However,
to date, no national reports have assessed insurance trends
among the general justice-involved population following im-
plementation of either the ACA’s dependent coverage man-
date, which expanded parental health insurance to children age
19–25,17,18 or Medicaid expansion and Marketplace plans.

 Furthermore, the relationship between health insurance and
mental health and SUD treatment has not been investigated
among a national cohort of justice-involved individuals.
To address this gap in knowledge, we analyzed data from
the National Survey of Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) to
assess whether uninsured rates for justice-involved individuals
age 19–25 decreased following implementation of the depen-
dent coverage mandate in September 2010. We also assessed
whether uninsured rates declined among justice-involved indi-
viduals of all ages following national health reform initiatives
that began in January 2014. Finally, we examined the associ-
ation between health insurance (Medicaid vs. private vs. un-
insured) and treatment among justice-involved individuals
with mental illness and SUD to provide insight into the po-
tential effect of health insurance expansion among this
population.
METHODS
Data Source and Study Population
We analyzed the seven most recent years of data (2008–2014)
from the National Survey of Drug Use and Health (NSDUH),
a nationally representative, cross-sectional survey of non-
institutionalized men and women that measures the prevalence
of drug use and mental health disorders in the United States.19
Response rates in each year were above 70 %. The survey is
sponsored by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Serv-
ices Administration (SAHMSA) and is conducted by RTI
International, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina. We
restricted our sample to non-elderly men and women age
19–64, because this age group was the target population for
the ACA’s key provisions to expand health insurance cover-
age. Our analysis did not require institutional review board
approval because it falls under the University of Michigan’s
policy for research using publicly available data sets.
Key Variables and Outcome Measures
Justice-involved individuals were defined as those who
reported being arrested and booked (excluding minor traffic
violations), paroled, or on probation in the 12 months preced-
ing the survey interview date.
An individual was determined to be uninsured if they were
not enrolled in a private or public health insurance plan at the
time of interview. For purposes of this study, health insurance
categorization was mutually exclusive. Those enrolled in a
private plan were excluded from the Medicaid category. Indi-
viduals not enrolled in a private plan or Medicaid were labelled
as BOther.^ Because NSDUH samples individuals evenly
throughout the entire year, insurance estimates represent an
average over all four quarters in each year, unless otherwise
specified.
Questions related to illicit drug abuse/dependence, alcohol
abuse/dependence, and depression are based on DSM IV
criteria. Illicit drug abuse/dependence is a composite score of
any cocaine, heroin, non-medical prescription opioid, or stim-
ulant abuse/dependence in the last 12 months. Estimates of
serious mental illness (SMI) are derived from a prediction
model developed by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health
Services Administration (SAHMSA) to measure SMI preva-
lence. SAHMSA’s prediction model utilizes the Kessler Psy-
chological Distress Scale (K6) and the World Health Organi-
zation Disability Assessment Schedule (WHODAS).19
All measures of treatment are based on self-report. Depres-
sion treatment was defined as receiving any counseling or
pharmacotherapy for depression within the last 12 months.
Treatment for alcohol abuse/dependence was defined as any
type of treatment for alcohol use within the last 12 months.
Illicit drug use treatment was defined as any type of treatment
for illicit drug use in the past 12 months. Treatment for serious
mental illness was defined as receiving any inpatient treat-
ment, outpatient treatment, or pharmacotherapy for mental
health in the last 12 months.
Statistical Analysis
We calculated weighted frequencies to compare sociodemo-
graphic characteristics and prevalence of depression, SMI,
alcohol abuse/dependence, and illicit drug abuse/dependence
among those with and without justice involvement. Chi-
square tests were performed to compare individuals with and
without justice-involvement.
We compared insurance rates among individuals age 19–25,
with and without justice-involvement, to individuals age 26–
34 using logistic regression. A dichotomous pre-post variable
was created to distinguish the periods of time before (prior to
quarter 4 of 2010) and after (beginning quarter 1 of 2011)
implementation of the dependent coverage mandate. For this
analysis only, we did not include quarter 4 of 2010 because it
was considered a transitional period, and we did not include
2014 data due to additional policy changes that took place
during that year. Justice-involvement was interacted with age
group and the pre-post variable in our logistic regression
model. Adjusted insurance rates were obtained using predic-
tive margins after controlling for gender, race/ethnicity, and
income as a percent of the federal poverty level. Difference-in-
differences were calculated using linear combinations of ad-
justed insurance rates.
We tabulated the proportion of uninsured each year for
individuals of all ages with and without justice involvement.
Uninsurance rates in 2014 among justice-involved individuals
were compared to uninsurance rates in preceding years using
logistic regression. Changes in type of insurance (i.e., Medic-
aid) among justice-involved individuals between 2013 and
2014 were compared using chi-square tests. We compared
changes in uninsurance between individuals with and without
justice involvement using multivariable logistic regression; to
allow for comparisons of trends between groups, we interacted
survey year with justice involvement (justice involvement vs.
1524

 no justice involvement) and controlled for age, race, and
gender. We used a difference-in-differences approach to com-
pare uninsurance declines between 2013 and 2014 among
individuals with and without justice involvement.
We pooled data from 2008 to 2014 and used multivariable
logistic regression, controlling for age, race, gender, and sur-
vey year, to examine associations between health insurance
coverage and treatment for depression, SMI, alcohol abuse/
dependence, and illicit drug abuse/dependence among justice-
involved individuals with those conditions. We pooled data for
these analyses because small sample sizes in individual years
resulted in estimates with large standard errors using repeated
cross sections. We analyzed data using Stata SE version 14.1
(StataCorp, College Station, TX) and utilized complex survey
design methods to account for clustered sampling. All data are
weighted, unless otherwise noted, to enable nationally repre-
sentative inferences. Stata’s subpopulation commands were
used for accurate variance estimation. Two-sided p values <
0.05 were considered statistically significant.
RESULTS
Study Population Characteristics
Our unweighted, pooled sample consisted of 15,899 individ-
uals with and 218,595 individuals without justice involvement
in the last 12 months. Justice-involved individuals accounted
for 4.6 % of our weighted sample and are representative of 8.6
million individuals in the United States between 2008 and
2014. They had statistically significantly different sociodemo-
graphic characteristics, self-reported health, and disease prev-
alence compared to people with no justice involvement (Ta-
ble 1). In particular, justice-involved individuals had a statis-
tically significant higher prevalence of depression, serious
mental illness, alcohol abuse or dependence, and illicit drug
abuse or dependence. Justice-involved individuals were also
younger and less likely to be female or non-Hispanic white.
Dependent Coverage Mandate
Following implementation of the dependent coverage man-
date in September 2010, uninsurance rates declined substan-
tially for justice-involved individuals age 19–25 compared to
justice-involved individuals age 26–34 (Fig. 1). After adjust-
ing for gender, race, and income, we found a statistically
significant reduction in uninsurance among justice-involved
individuals age 19–25 (Table 2). Gains in insurance were due
to an increase in private insurance coverage among individuals
ages 19–25, relative to those ages 26–34. Consistent with
previous analyses,20 we found that uninsurance rates also
declined among individuals age 19–25 without a history of
justice involvement (−6.5 %; P < 0.001). Declines in uninsur-
ance following the dependent coverage mandate were signif-
icantly larger for justice-involved individuals compared to
individuals without justice involvement (−6.5 %; p = 0.03).
Medicaid Expansion and Marketplace Plans
Uninsurance rates among justice-involved individuals de-
clined substantially (Fig. 2) following implementation of Med-
icaid expansion and Marketplace plans in 2014. Uninsurance
rates for justice-involved individuals in 2014 were lower than
any prior year in our study (p < 0.005), but remained statisti-
cally significantly higher than uninsurance rates for those
without justice involvement in multivariable analyses (differ-
ence, 16.3 %; p < 0.001; Adjusted difference, 11.4 %;
p < 0.001). Uninsurance declines between 2013 and 2014 did
not differ significantly between individuals with and without a
history of justice involvement after controlling for age, gender,
and race (difference-in-differences, −4.3 %; p = 0.07).
A decline in uninsurance among justice-involved individu-
als between 2013 and 2014 was due mostly to a statistically
significant increase in Medicaid enrollment from 2013 to 2014
(6.3 %; p < 0.001) (Fig. 3).
Access to Mental Health and SUD Treatment
Among justice-involved individuals with depression based on
DSM IV criteria, Medicaid, but not private insurance, was
associated with significantly higher levels of treatment in the
2008–2014 period compared to uninsurance [Average treatment
effect (ATE), (17.2 %; p < 0.001)] (Fig. 4). Medicaid and pri-
vate insurance were both associated with significantly higher
levels of treatment among justice-involved individuals with
serious mental illness compared to those without insurance

Among justice-involved individuals with alcohol abuse/
dependence, Medicaid and private insurance were also associ-
ated with higher levels of treatment in adjusted analyses [ATE,

Medicaid alone was associated with SUD treatment among
those with illicit drug abuse/dependence (ATE, 12.6 %;
p < 0.05). Justice-involved individuals with Medicaid were sig-
nificantly more likely than individuals with private insurance to

DISCUSSION
In this nationally representative study of non-elderly justice-
involved adults in the United States, we found that
uninsurance rates declined substantially for individuals age
19–25 years after implementation of the dependent coverage
mandate in 2010. Uninsurance declined for justice-involved
individuals of all ages following expansion of Medicaid, sub-
sidized private insurance, and the individual mandate under
the ACA in 2014. Uninsurance decreased in 2014 mostly due
to an increase in Medicaid enrollment. However, uninsured
rates among justice-involved individuals remained approxi-
mately two times higher than uninsured rates among individ-
uals without justice involvement. In pooled analyses, Medic-
aid coverage was associated with higher rates of mental health
and SUD treatment among justice-involved individuals, but
overall rates of treatment for SUD remained low. These data
suggest that justice-involved individuals are gaining health
insurance coverage under the ACA, but may still face barriers
to care for some behavioral health conditions.
The dependent coverage mandate, which expanded private
health insurance to dependents ages 19–25 in September
2010,21 was associated with a dramatic decrease in uninsurance
among justice-involved individuals, due primarily to an increase
in private insurance coverage. The mandate decreased uninsur-
ance to a larger degree for justice-involved individuals com-
pared to individuals without a history of justice involvement.
Although Medicaid has traditionally been the key source of
coverage for justice-involved individuals,22,23 our results sug-
gest that private health insurance reforms may improve cover-
age for a subset of this vulnerable population. In fact, private
health insurance reforms that target young individuals may
disproportionately improve access for justice-involved popula-
tions because they are younger than the general population.

 We found that uninsurance declined among the general
justice-involved population following implementation of
Medicaid expansion and Marketplace plans. Our findings
expand on a recent study that found uninsurance declined
among substance users with recent justice involvement.16
Although uninsurance reached historic lows among the
justice-involved population, we found that they still remain
substantially higher than uninsurance rates among the general
public.
Persistently elevated uninsurance among justice-involved
individuals, following several years of expanded dependent
coverage and the first year of Medicaid expansion and subsi-
dized private insurance, may partly be explained by the 24
states choosing to forego Medicaid expansion. Many of these
states have above average incarceration rates and incarcerated
populations.1,24 Several states have also developed unique
insurance enrollment processes for justice-involved individu-
als that may not have been optimized in the first year of
Medicaid expansion.25 For instance, some jails and prisons
began allowing Medicaid enrollment during incarceration,
accepting alternative forms of identification, and developing
electronic enrollment systems in 2014.26 Follow-up study is
needed to assess whether coverage has increased among
justice-involved individuals due to these enrollment efforts
or increasing familiarity with eligibility over time, and as more
states adopt Medicaid expansion. Additionally, future work
should investigate differences between states that have and
have not expanded Medicaid.

 The ACA is expected to improve access to mental health and
substance use services.27,28 In pooled analyses, we found that
both Medicaid and private insurance, compared to uninsurance,
are associated with treatment for serious mental illness and
alcohol abuse treatment among justice-involved individuals with
those conditions, although treatment for alcohol abuse in partic-
ular remains disturbingly low. We also found that Medicaid, but
not private insurance, was associated with treatment among
justice-involved individuals with illicit drug abuse/dependence
or depression. Our finding that Medicaid is associated with higher
treatment rates for some behavioral health conditions compared
to private insurance builds upon previous work indicating that
Medicaid improves access to behavioral health care for low-
income adults.29,30 Our findings suggest that Medicaid expansion
may be of greater benefit for this population than private insur-
ance expansion, perhaps because Medicaid offers improved care
coordination to connect individuals to services31,32 or because
Medicaid providers are more familiar with SUDs, which are
more prevalent among low-income populations.33
We note, however, that we were unable to determine when
individuals accessed treatment services relative to their justice
involvement. Because NSDUH is a cross-sectional survey, we
could only examine whether justice involvement and treat-
ment occurred in the preceding 12 months. Future work
should compare trends in treatment rates for justice-involved
individuals as Medicaid programs continue to develop inte-
grated medical homes with physical health, mental health, and
SUD treatment services.34
Our study has important limitations. NSDUH is a house-
hold survey that excludes individuals who are homeless. Be-
cause justice-involved individuals are disproportionately
homeless or unstably housed,35 they may be under-
represented in this study. Treatment data and health insurance
status are also self-reported and are available for only one year
after Medicaid expansion and Marketplace implementation.
Finally, degree of justice involvement and length of incarcer-
ation could not be determined, nor could justice involvement
beyond the previous 12 months; these factors may alter dis-
ease prevalence and health outcomes. These limitations not-
withstanding, we were able to provide national estimates of
health insurance coverage among a vulnerable population
soon after implementation of the ACA’s key provisions.
CONCLUSION
Although uninsured rates declined substantially among justice-
involved individuals age 19–25 following implementation of
the dependent coverage mandate in 2010 and among individu-
als of all ages following Medicaid expansion and Marketplace
plans in 2014, disparities in health insurance persisted between
individuals with and without criminal justice involvement at the
end of 2014. Our findings highlight the potential impact of the
ACA on mental health treatment for justice-involved individu-
als, but indicate that, while coverage (especially Medicaid) is
associated with improved treatment rates for mental illness and
substance use disorders, many barriers remain. Persistently high
uninsurance rates, lack of care coordination,36 and poor access
to high quality behavioral health treatment8 remain critical
public health issues given the high prevalence of mental health
and substance use disorders among justice-involved individu-
als. Continued outreach is needed to close the insurance gap
between individuals with and without criminal justice involve-
ment, to ensure that individuals eligible for public insurance or
insurance subsidies are enrolled and, once enrolled, have access
to robust behavioral health services.
