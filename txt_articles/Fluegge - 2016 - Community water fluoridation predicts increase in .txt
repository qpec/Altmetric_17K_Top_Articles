 Community water fluoridation predicts increase in
age-adjusted incidence and prevalence of diabetes in
22 states from 2005 and 2010
Kyle Fluegge
ABSTRACT
Community water fluoridation is considered a significant public health achievement of the 20th
century. In this paper, the hypothesis that added water fluoridation has contributed to diabetes
incidence and prevalence in the United States was investigated. Panel data from publicly available
sources were used with population-averaged models to test the associations of added and natural
fluoride on the outcomes at the county level in 22 states for the years 2005 and 2010. The findings
suggest that a 1 mg increase in the county mean added fluoride significantly positively predicts a
0.23 per 1,000 person increase in age-adjusted diabetes incidence (P < 0.001), and a 0.17% increase
in age-adjusted diabetes prevalence percent (P < 0.001), while natural fluoride concentration is
significantly protective. For counties using fluorosilicic acid as the chemical additive, both outcomes
were lower: by 0.45 per 1,000 persons (P < 0.001) and 0.33% (P < 0.001), respectively. These findings
are adjusted for county-level and time-varying changes in per capita tap water consumption, poverty,
year, population density, age-adjusted obesity and physical inactivity, and mean number of years
since water fluoridation started. Sensitivity analyses revealed robust effects for both types of
fluoride. Community water fluoridation is associated with epidemiological outcomes for diabetes.

INTRODUCTION
Water fluoridation has reportedly produced great benefit to
society, often by reducing dental caries and hence the cost
that comes with untreated or advanced periodontal disease
(Griffin et al. a, b; Jones et al. ), which may
itself often be a trigger of other chronic conditions (Cullinan
& Seymour ). The side effects of water fluoridation have
generally appeared to be either inconclusive or minimal
(Leone et al. ; Morgan et al. ; McDonagh et al.
; Broadbent et al. ), with some notable exceptions
for
hypothyroidism
prevalence
(Pearce
;
Peckham
et al. ). Taken together, these observations suggest that
water fluoridation has indeed been one of the great public
health accomplishments of the twentieth century (Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) ).
Research conducted before and after the widespread
implementation of water fluoridation in the 1940s in the
United States has suggested that fluoride is a potent preser-
vative of blood glucose (Roe et al. ; Chan et al. ),
thereby inhibiting glycolysis (Halpern ). Specifically,
such glycolytic inhibition from fluoride is thought to miti-
gate oral bacteria enolase activity (Hüther et al. ).
Enolase is an enzyme acting late in the glycolytic pathway
(Pancholi ). It is this mechanism which is considered
to prevent dental caries, although there has been no general
agreement that the anti-microbial effects of fluoride contrib-
ute to the anti-caries effect of the chemical (Hamilton ).
However, one issue that remains is the distinction
between fluoride’s uses as (1) a topical agent in preventing
dental caries (as described above) versus (2) its utility as
an ingested additive. The topical effect of fluoride, demon-
strated by showing caries reduction, was the result of
fluoride acting on the external surface of the teeth, not

 through ingestion of fluoride itself (Bibby et al. ). Given
the known glycolytic inhibition of sodium fluoride in bac-
teria, it is plausible that a similar phenomenon could
occur in humans. Sodium fluoride that is ingested produced
significant decrements in plasma insulin (Rigalli et al. ),
which is known to regulate glycolysis (Wu et al. ). Fur-
thermore, hypothyroidism, whose deleterious association
with water fluoridation was documented above, may be
the body’s attempt to ameliorate the effects of a prolonged
hyperglycemic state or uncontrolled diabetes (Mouradian
& Abourizk ; Celani et al. ): type 2 diabetes mellitus
patients are more likely to have subclinical hypothyroidism
(Han et al. ).
Over the past 32 years, from 1980 to 2012, the number
of adults with diagnosed diabetes in the United States
nearly quadrupled, from 5.5 million to 21.3 million (CDC
). Among adults, about 1.7 million new cases of diabetes
are diagnosed each year. If this trend continues, as many as
one out of every three adults in the United States could have
diabetes by 2050. Moreover, previous research has indicated
as many as 30–40% of diabetics went undiagnosed in the
United States in recent decades (Gregg et al. ; Cowie
et al. ). Persistently elevated blood sugar represents
one of the most costly and potentially fatal complications
associated with diabetes, including a hyperosmolar hyper-
glycemic state (Kitabchi et al. ). Furthermore, the risk
of hypoglycemia remains a serious and costly adverse
effect of metabolic disease (Erdogan et al. ; Meher
et al. ) and diabetic pharmacotherapy (Quilliam et al.
). Given the profound and growing impacts of diabetes
on the American health care system (Seuring et al. )
and the potential for continued adverse side effects from dia-
betes medications such as dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors
(Food and Drug Administration ), it is worth re-examin-
ing the potential influences of fluoride on its prevalence to
ensure that all avenues are investigated and, if appropriate,
exonerated from further consideration.
After all these years, the question remains unanswered:
to what extent does fluoride predict changes in diabetes out-
comes in the United States? The objective of the present
study is to robustly examine the associations between
added and naturally present fluoride and epidemiological
outcomes of diabetes, including prevalence and incidence.
METHODS
Data
To analyze the association between diabetes outcomes and
community water fluoridation, data were collected from
state fluoridation reports, available in the My Water’s Fluor-
ide portal through the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC a). Although the CDC lists 25 states
as having available operational reports, only 22 were acces-
sible via their website. Hence, this investigation focuses on
these 22 states, which are identified in Figure 1.
At the time of access, the state fluoridation reports con-
tained the following variables used in the analysis: (1) water
system ID, (2) primary county of the water system, (3) fluori-
dation chemical (sodium fluoride, fluorosilicic acid, or
sodium fluorosilicate), (4) fluoridation start date, (5) natural
fluoride level and (6) optimal fluoride level (both in parts per
million, ppm). Optimal fluoride level was defined by a range
of 0.7–1.2 mg/L (ppm ¼ mg/L) issued in 1962 by the US
Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). Every
water system independently sets their own optimal level.
Each water system was designated a status regarding water flu-
oridation; those with a classification of ‘adjusted’ meant that
the level of fluoride in the tap water was manipulated using
one of the above listed chemicals to achieve an optimal level.
Other reported statuses included ‘non’, ‘nat’, or ‘cons’. ‘Non’
status referred to water systems with an insufficient natural flu-
oride level (<0.7 mg/L) but no fluoridation chemical identified
to achieve optimal status; ‘nat’ status generally denoted water
systems with a sufficient natural fluoride level (�0.7 mg/L);
‘cons’ status identified water systems with missing information
for both the natural fluoride concentration and chemical used.
To these list, several additional variables were generated.
The
five-digit
Federal
Information
Processing
Standard
(FIPS) code was inserted, which uniquely identifies counties
and county equivalents, to facilitate (1) the averaging of natural
and optimal levels of fluoride concentrations by county and (2)
the merging with other CDC data. The natural and optimal flu-
oride levels, defined by the water system, were averaged by
county. All data available on natural fluoride concentrations
(i.e. using water systems with ‘adj’, ‘non’ or ‘nat’ status) were
used to produce a county average for natural fluoride. To

 calculate the average added levels for each county, only water
systems with an adjusted status where fluoridation chemicals
could be identified were used. To calculate the mean added flu-
oride concentration, the mean natural level was subtracted
from the mean optimal level for the county. Similarly, the cri-
terion for defining the fluoridation chemical was the type of
additive used by a water system in a county with an adjusted
status. Thus a county could be identified as using all three
chemicals if at least three different water systems in the
county with an adjusted status used each chemical. A mean
‘years fluoridated’ variable was also defined, which was com-
puted as the number of years before December 31, 2004 and
December 31, 2009 that a water system was fluoridated, aver-
aged over the county. A negative outcome here suggested that
water fluoridation started after these dates. The ‘years fluori-
dated’ variable also only reflects the average among water
systems in a county with an adjusted status.
The most recent fluoridation start date provided among
all water systems in the 22 states identified was January
2011. This was interpreted as the last date of update for
these data. Hence, the scope of our analyses was limited
to the complete calendar year 2010 and the years prior.
To these fluoride data, other covariates were added that
reflected our outcomes and other relevant predictors. These
data came from the County Data Indicators profile of the Dia-
betes Data and Statistics portal through the CDC (CDC
b). In particular, county-level data for the years 2005 and
2010 were collected for the following indicators: (1) diabetes
incidence and prevalence (the outcomes), (2) obesity preva-
lence and (3) leisure-time physical inactivity prevalence. The
estimates for diagnosed diabetes, obesity and physical inactivity
were derived using data from the Census and Behavioral Risk
Factor Surveillance System, an ongoing, state-based, random-
digit–dialed telephone survey of the US civilian, non-institutio-
nalized population aged 18 years and older. The physical
inactivity rates reflected adults who reported no physical
activity or exercise other than at their regular job. County-
level and year-specific poverty (number of people in poverty)
and population per square mile statistics from the Area
Health and Resource File for the years 2005 and 2010 (AHRF
) were also sourced. Poverty was normalized as a percent
(number of persons in poverty divided by the total population
for a specific year). The population density variable was
logged and its squared term was also included as a covariate.

 To compute the primary exposures to fluoride, water
consumption
data
from
the
US
Geological
Survey
(USGS) (USGS ) were collected. The USGS gave two
variables of interest: ‘Domestic, deliveries from Public
Supply,
in
Mgal/d’
(labeled
DO-PSDel)
and
‘Public
Supply, total population served, in thousands’ (labeled
PS-TOPop). These data were available for the years 2005
and 2010 for all counties. For each FIPS code, a ratio
was created, dividing domestic deliveries per county in
millions of liters per day by total people supplied to get a
per capita water delivery. The USGS estimates that an indi-
vidual uses 302.8–378.5 L of water a day. It was estimated
that each individual drinks 1.9 L of water a day. Dividing
1.9 L by 302.8 (≈0.625%) and 378.5 (¼0.5%) liters yields
an approximate range of the proportion of the per capita
supply that is actually ingested. Multiplying per capita
water consumption in liters by 0.625% provides the upper
limit (UL) on the water supply that is ingested, whereas
multiplying by 0.5% gives the lower limit (LL). The result-
ing products are estimates in liters of water. Converting
these per capita outcomes for water intake to liters and
multiplying by the (added or natural) fluoride exposure in
milligrams per liter averaged by county gives the unit of
measurement for the fluoride covariates in terms of milli-
grams.
For
comparison,
exposure where
the
fluoride
concentration is unadjusted for per capita tap water con-
sumption was also considered. Thus, there were two sets
of regressions for the diabetes outcomes: the aforemen-
tioned analysis with the primary exposure in milligrams
(mg) and an alternative, unadjusted analysis with the pri-
mary exposure in ppm.
Regression analyses
In accordance with the research inquiries, two sets of
regressions were composed using generalized estimating
equations (GEE) population-averaged models using autore-
gressive
(AR1)
correlation
structures,
common
to
quantitative longitudinal data (Liang & Zeger ; Zeger
& Liang ; Diggle et al. ). A GEE is used to estimate
the parameters of a generalized linear model with a possible
unknown correlation between outcomes of interest. The unit
of analysis is the county. The regression sets focus separately
on the analysis of naturally occurring and added fluoride
and are specified as the following:

refers to the outcomes (i.e. incidence rate [E ¼ 1]
and prevalence percent [E ¼ 2] of diabetes) for S fluoride
exposure in M units in county j of state k at year t (t ¼
2005 or 2010), FLS,M
jkt
gives the fluoride concentration for
county j of state k, where S ¼ 1 references natural fluoride
level, S ¼ 2 describes the added fluoride concentration,
M ¼ 1 denotes the exposure assessed in milligrams (adjusted
by county-level per capita tap water consumption) and M ¼
2 indicates the exposure in ppm (unadjusted for county-level
tap water consumption); CHEMi,jk refers to one of three
chemicals, i ¼ 1, 2, 3, used to adjust the fluoride concen-
tration (i.e. sodium fluoride, fluorosilicic acid, or sodium
fluorosilicate), X p,jkt refers to the regressor set of seven cov-
ariates that might modify the primary relationship of
interest, all of which vary by time: (1) the age-adjusted pro-
portion of individuals reporting physical inactivity, (2) the
age-adjusted proportion of obese individuals, (3) the average
number of years prior to December 31, 2004 (for the 2005
outcome) or December 31, 2009 (for the 2010 outcome) in
which county j began fluoridating its water supply, (4) the
proportion of individuals in poverty, (5) the logged popu-
lation per square mile value, (6) a year variable and (7) the
logged population per square mile value squared.
Eight (¼23 given E ¼ 1, 2; M ¼ 1, 2; S ¼ 1, 2) separate
models were analyzed. For each unit model (M ¼ 1, 2), there
were eleven estimated parameters in the S ¼ 2 model and
seven estimated parameters in the S ¼ 1 model (three fluori-
dation chemicals and years of fluoridation are excluded in
the natural fluoride models). Sensitivity analyses were con-
ducted by
combining
the natural
and
added
fluoride
concentrations in one model for each E, M combination.
All analyses were completed with Stata 11.1 (StataCorp
). The significance of variables was indicated with P <
0.05, but also reported for lower significance thresholds
(P < 0.01, P < 0.001) where appropriate. No ethics approval
was required for the study, given its exclusive reliance on
publicly accessible data.

 RESULTS
Figure 2 describes the changes in diagnosed diabetes from
2005 to 2010 at the county level. The areas identified in
the dark color in the figure isolate counties and states with
a particularly heavy burden of diabetes: the South and Appa-
lachia. Cross-matched with the states highlighted in Figure 1
this suggests that investigation of the impact of water fluori-
dation on diabetes outcomes using these data is sufficient to
determine the association.
Figure 3 graphically shows the number and percentage of
the US population with diagnosed diabetes from 1958
through
2013 (CDC ).
An
ordinary
least
squares
regression check revealed a significant non-linear relation-
ship between the year and diabetes outcomes: the subset of
data from 1993 onwards demonstrated no linearity violation,
whereas the period up to 1993 showed significant violations.
Thus, in the last two decades, the growth in diabetes has been
on a mostly linear trajectory, which has been confirmed in a
recent study on comorbidities including diabetes among

 older US adults (Fluegge ), making exhaustive inquiries
into the potential causes especially relevant.
Figure 4 displays the histograms of the outcome vari-
ables: age-adjusted incidence (top panel) and age-adjusted
prevalence of diabetes (bottom panel) by year. The mean
incidence rate declined from 2005 to 2010: mean in 2005
was 10.65 per 1,000 individuals (SD ¼ 2.52) and mean in
2010 was 10.45 per 1,000 individuals (SD ¼ 2.73). A two-
sample paired t-test with equal variances revealed an insig-
nificant decline in the incidence (P ¼ 0.10). The mean
prevalence percent significantly increased from 2005 to
2010: the mean in 2005 was 8.2% (SD ¼ 1.74) and the
mean in 2010 was 9.8% (SD ¼ 2.22). A two-sample paired
t-test with equal variances demonstrated a highly significant
increase in the prevalence of diabetes (P < 0.001).
Figure 5 includes histograms of the adjusted fluoride
exposure variables: added (top panel) and natural fluoride
(bottom panel) in milligrams. Recall the added fluoride covari-
ate was calculated as the difference in mean values between the
county-defined optimal and natural levels. Thus, it is possible to
have negative values if there exists a very high natural level.
There were 64 county-year observations with negative mean
differences for added fluoride concentration. The LL mean
exposure level for added fluoride declined from 2005 to 2010:
the mean in 2005 was 1.22 mg (SD ¼ 0.75) and the mean in
2010 was 1.08 mg (SD ¼ 0.51). A two-sample paired t-test
with equal variances indicated a significant decline in the
exposure level (P < 0.001). The LL mean exposure level for
natural fluoride also declined from 2005 to 2010: the mean in
2005 was 0.46 mg (SD ¼ 0.61) and the mean in 2010 was 0.38
(SD ¼ 0.49). A Wilcoxon signed-rank test also produced a
significant decline in the exposure level (P < 0.001). Impor-
tantly, both of these decreases were attributed to the decline
in per capita tap water consumption (reference Table 2).
Table 1 presents the counties by fluoridation status.
Recall the average added fluoride level is generated from
water systems in counties with an adjusted status. Average
natural fluoride is based on water systems from ‘adj’, ‘non’
or ‘nat’ status.
For the ‘non’ status, 2733 water systems did not have data
on optimal fluoridation level. The natural fluoride level is
based on 11007 water systems in 1562 counties. Average
added fluoride for 836 counties is based on data from 8274
water systems in those counties. No data on fluoridation
chemical are available for water systems with ‘non’ status.
For the ‘nat’ status water systems, the natural fluoride
level is based on 3054 water systems across 574 counties.
Optimal levels were reported for 2329 water systems in
484 counties, but no data on fluoridation chemicals were
available for water systems with ‘nat’ status. Hence an aver-
age added concentration was not calculated. Note, however,
that 521 water systems spanning 187 counties with natural
fluoride levels under the optimal level indicated were
reported under the ‘nat’ status.
For the ‘cons’ status, no data on natural fluoride or flu-
oridation chemical were available. Only optimal levels

 were reported. 658 water systems in 116 counties did not
have data on optimal fluoridation level.
Table 2 presents the descriptive statistics for the 925
counties in 2005 and 2010 (1,850 total observations). To
account for non-normality, Wilcoxon signed-rank tests
were used to describe changes in the covariates from the
year 2005 to 2010. All variables changed significantly (P <
0.001) in the 5-year lapse between observations. The fluori-
dation chemical covariates were not time-varying. There
were 155 counties where only sodium fluoride was used,
536 where only fluorosilicic acid was added and 54 where
sodium fluorosilicate was the only additive. A minority
(19%) of counties used more than one additive: 102 where
sodium fluoride and fluorosilicic acid were used, 28 where
sodium fluoride and sodium fluorosilicate were used, 33
where fluorosilicic acid and sodium fluorosilicate were
used and 16 where all three additives were resourced. As a
consequence of this minority of multiple additives, all
three
fluoridation
chemicals
were
retained
as
binary
variables in the regressions. Finally, per capita water con-
sumption (UL/LL) decreased, whereas poverty, obesity
and physical inactivity increased significantly (P < 0.001).
Table 3 presents the M ¼ 1 GEE estimates for both dia-
betes outcomes. The covariates of special interest are the
fluoride exposures, using the LL of per capita water consump-
tion. In the incidence models (E ¼ 1), adjusting for changes in
physical inactivity, obesity, poverty, log population per square
mile, mean number of years fluoridated and year, a 1 mg
increase in the amount of added fluoride for an average
county significantly increased the diabetes incidence by
0.23 per 1,000 (P < 0.001) as compared to a county without
such an increase, whereas for natural fluoride the estimate
was of equal magnitude and significance, but negative.
The effect of added fluoride on incidence was slightly
greater than half the effect of age-adjusted obesity prevalence
(β ¼ 0.31, P < 0.001), which suggests that a 1% increase in the
obesity prevalence for an average county drives incidence up
by 0.31 per 1,000 persons as compared to a county not

 experiencing a comparable increase in obesity prevalence.
The coefficient for year indicates that the incidence of dia-
betes declined in the selected states from 2005 to 2010
(β ¼ –1.85, P < 0.001). Finally, the type of fluoridation chemi-
cal used may also make a significant difference in diabetes
incidence. Among the three used in this data set, fluorosilicic
acid was most significantly associated with reduced diabetes
incidence (β ¼ –0.45, P < 0.001), inducing the greatest decline
in incidence apart from the year variable.
The results for the E ¼ 2 models with age-adjusted dia-
betes prevalence percent as the outcome largely mirrored
the incidence models, with a notable exception for the year
variable, which now produced a positive effect (β ¼ 0.33,
P < 0.001). Importantly, the results for the added fluoride
concentration (β ¼ 0.17, P < 0.01) and fluorosilicic acid
(β ¼ –0.33, P < 0.001) were mostly unchanged.
Fluoridation chemical is included as a confounder in the
S ¼ 2 models, but it could be an effect modifier rather than a

these analyses, it was necessary to model fluoridation chemi-

 To further refine our understanding of the associations
between
fluoridation
chemicals
and
diabetes
outcomes,
simple bivariate models were used to analyze each fluoridation
chemical’s association with the diabetes outcomes using the
GEE structure. Sodium fluoride produced significantly positive
associations with incidence (β ¼ 0.93, P < 0.001) and preva-
lence (β ¼ 0.76, P < 0.001), whereas fluorosilicic acid and
sodium fluorosilicate produced significantly negative associ-
ations respectively (fluorosilicic acid: β ¼ –0.72, P < 0.001 and
β ¼ –0.54, P ¼ 0.002; sodium fluorosilicate: β ¼ –0.55, P ¼ 0.05
and β ¼ –0.49, P ¼ 0.02). Thus the comparisons are all relative.
The protective effects of fluorosilicic acid and/or sodium fluor-
osilicate in the multivariable GEE models are, alternatively
stated, a deleterious consequence of sodium fluoride use.
Table 4 presents the M ¼ 2 GEE estimates for both
regression sets, using ppm as the exposure measure. For
both added fluoride and natural fluoride, the estimates
aligned with the set of M ¼ 1 results, only greater in magni-
tude. For added fluoride, a 1 ppm increase produced a 0.35
per 1,000 increase in diabetes incidence (P < 0.001) and a
0.27% increase in prevalence (P < 0.001), whereas the
respective estimates for natural fluoride were 0.73 per
1,000 decline (P < 0.001) and a 0.55% decline (P < 0.001).
The counterintuitive findings for significance and sign of
the ‘years water system fluoridated’ between the M ¼ 1 and
M ¼ 2 models was noted. There was a low (but significant)
and negative correlation (rho ¼ �0.18, P < 0.001) between
the average years a county’s water supply has been fluoridated
and per capita consumption of tap water in that county. It
appears that the negative parameter estimates may be the
result of a selection issue (the longer a water system is fluori-
dated, the more migration to alternative water sources may be
occurring). Given the significance disappears when the per
capita tap water consumption component is integrated into
the models suggests this may be the case.
Table 5 displays the sensitivity results from the com-
bined exposures. In 32 counties, the mean quantity of
natural fluoride was greater than the mean optimal level.
In these cases, the added fluoride concentration was nega-
tive, which might confound any protective effect of the
natural fluoride concentration seen in the analyses thus
far. Therefore, these 64 county-year observations were
removed and the GEE analyses re-run for both outcomes
in the sensitivity analyses. For the M ¼ 1 models, the results
coincided with those presented in Tables 3 and 4. That is,
added fluoride exerted a positive and significant change on
incidence (0.26 per 1,000 increase) and prevalence (0.22%
increase), whereas natural fluoride exhibited a protective
effect (0.45 per 1,000 decrease and 0.32% decline, respect-
ively). For the M ¼ 2 model set, however, both exposures
demonstrated negative relationships, with the effect of natu-
ral fluoride (3.12 per 1,000 decline in incidence and 2.3%
reduction in prevalence) being about twice that of added
fluoride (1.68 per 1,000 decrease in incidence and 1.09%
decline
in
prevalence).
Thus,
the
sensitivity
analyses
showed that only the adjusted exposures (using milligrams
to account for per capita tap water consumption) revealed
robustly consistent associations with diabetes outcomes.
DISCUSSION
In this report, the relationship between added fluoride and
diabetes in 22 states using population-averaged models
was examined, which revealed the following main findings:
1. Fluoride added to achieve optimal levels (defined as
between 0.7–1.2 ppm) was significantly positively and
robustly associated with increases in both the incidence
and prevalence of diabetes from 2005 to 2010 when
accounting for per capita consumption of tap water.
2. Among the three fluoridation chemicals used in this data
set (sodium fluoride, fluorosilicic acid, or sodium fluoro-
silicate), only fluorosilicic acid was significantly and
robustly associated with decreases in incidence and
prevalence of diabetes.
The first main finding is valuable because of the adjust-
ment for per capita tap water consumption, whereas the
second is useful in discriminating between similar yet dis-
tinct exposures. Ten independent US and Canadian studies
published from 1958 to 1987 have shown that dietary fluor-
ide intakes by adults ranged from 1.4 to 3.4 mg/day in areas
where the water fluoride concentration was 1.0 mg/L (Insti-
tute of Medicine (IOM) ). Applying the upper bound of
this range to the model results of this analysis (Table 5)
suggests that within a 5-year span, the incidence of diabetes
could increase by up to 0.88 per 1,000 persons and preva-
lence may grow by as much as 0.85% as a consequence of
water fluoridation alone. However, these are likely liberal

 added fluoride exposure were especially remarkable. Per
capita consumption of tap water has declined significantly
from 2005 to 2010 in the states examined (see Table 1). This
result is informative when also considering the larger substi-
tution effect potentially at play: per capita consumption of
bottled water has increased in the USA during the same
time: 25.4 gallons per capita in 2005 to 28.3 gallons per
capita in 2010 (Rodwan ). Note that, unfortunately, this
consumption statistic is not available at county level, the unit
of analysis in the current inquiry. Bottled water has less fluor-
ide compared to community tap water. According to the
United States Department of Agriculture, the average level
of fluoride in bottled water is 0.14 ppm (Cutrufelli et al.
), with less than 15% of bottled waters surveyed (2/14
brands) containing more than 0.3 ppm (0.31 and 0.34 ppm).
This is 83% lower than the mean fluoride concentration for
tap water across all municipal regions in the United States
(0.81 ppm). Hence, the explanation for the sign reversal for
the added fluoride concentration in the unadjusted analysis
may be explained, in part, by the increased collective con-
sumption
of
bottled
water.
Interacting
added
fluoride
concentration with declining per capita consumption of tap
water produced the robustly positive results with diabetes out-
comes. No interaction produced the negative results, likely
attributable to the increased consumption of bottled water
with a lower fluoride concentration.
More work is needed to understand the significant
association between fluorosilicic acid and diabetes out-
comes before a policy recommendation is made for use of
one chemical or another. Recent research has demonstrated
significant cost saving from using sodium fluoride in place of
fluorosilicic acid (Hirzy et al. ). However, the prior cost-
benefit analysis did not consider costs associated with dia-
betes, which represents a major and growing disease
burden. Fluorosilicic acid is listed in Section 8(b) of the
US Toxic Substances Control Act of 1976. However, harm
from exposure to fluorosilicic acid via drinking water is
expected to be minimal since it hydrolyzes almost comple-
tely under these conditions (Haneke & Carson ).
These population-based results offer greater insight into a
future cost-benefit analysis of widespread community water
fluoridation. Other policy adjustments may carry forward
from this research, including reducing the optimal levels of
fluoride to minimize impacts on diabetes outcomes and/or
using chemicals that do not exacerbate the burden of dia-
betes as much (use of fluorosilicic acid, for example). This
research partly supports the April 2015 decision by the
HHS that the new optimal level of added fluoride be reduced
to 0.7 mg of fluoride per liter of water to prevent tooth decay,
which is a revision downward from the previous rec-
ommended range of 0.7 to 1.2 mg/L issued in 1962.
The significant results for natural fluoride were surpris-
ing, albeit not unwelcome. They are explainable by drawing
upon the quality of water, specifically its hardness. Naturally
hard water may contain greater amounts of inorganic fluor-
ide minerals, such as fluorite (CaF2)), which are not as well
absorbed when compared to sodium fluoride (NaF) (Shan-
non ). Hard water is also indicative of the presence of
higher levels of magnesium, which may itself offer protection
from developing diabetes (Lopez-Ridaura et al. ; Hruby
et al. ). Furthermore, greater consumption of dairy
products may reduce bioavailability of consumed fluoride
(Ekstrand & Ehrnebo ). Such dietary alterations have dis-
tinctly shown great promise in reducing the risk of diabetes
(Choi et al. ; Tong et al. ; Chen et al. ).
There are several limitations to this work. First, it is dif-
ficult to unequivocally state that these results are the specific
consequences of water fluoridation. This is for two reasons.
Although the hypothesis and evidence here are suggestive, it
is inherently difficult to establish such a connection with
aggregate data vulnerable to the ecological fallacy. Further-
more, fluoridation is not the only source of exposure to
fluoride. Research over the years has also indicated another
nontrivial source of fluoride exposure through foods (Rao
; Rankin et al. ). Second, as the secondary results
demonstrate, diabetes most likely has a multifactorial etiol-
ogy, even including epigenetic processes. Although the
presence of added fluoride may play a role, its influence is
almost certainly modified by other important and pervasive
exposures and physiological processes that should not be
marginalized. It has been shown that the association is
robust to only a small, albeit notable and well-recognized,
set of factors, including obesity, physical inactivity and pov-
erty (Everson et al. ; Hamilton et al. ; Garber ).
Finally, the analyses presented here were limited by the
availability of data. Access and use of publicly available
data that fit with the time period of interest (the years
2005 and 2010) was attempted; however, comparable and
