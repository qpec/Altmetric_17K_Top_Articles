SUMMARY
The gut microbiota plays a significant role in the pro-
gression of fatty liver disease; however, the media-
tors and their mechanisms remain to be elucidated.
Comparing metabolite profile differences between
germ-free and conventionally raised mice against
differences between mice fed a low- and high-fat
diet (HFD), we identified tryptamine and indole-3-
acetate (I3A) as metabolites that depend on the
microbiota and are depleted under a HFD. Both me-
tabolites reduced fatty-acid- and LPS-stimulated
production of pro-inflammatory cytokines in macro-
phages and inhibited the migration of cells toward
a chemokine, with I3A exhibiting greater potency.
In hepatocytes, I3A attenuated inflammatory re-
sponses under lipid loading and reduced the expres-
sion of fatty acid synthase and sterol regulatory
element-binding
protein-1c.
These
effects
were
abrogated in the presence of an aryl-hydrocarbon
receptor (AhR) antagonist, indicating that the effects
are AhR dependent. Our results suggest that gut
microbiota could influence inflammatory responses
in the liver through metabolites engaging host
receptors.
INTRODUCTION
Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most prevalent
chronic liver disease in Western countries, and its incidence
strongly correlates with obesity and the metabolic syndrome
(Day, 2011). It encompasses a spectrum of disorders from
simple steatosis, by itself a benign condition, to non-alcoholic
steatohepatitis (NASH), characterized by intrahepatic inflam-
mation, hepatocellular ballooning, and progressive fibrosis
(Loomba and Sanyal, 2013). Sustained steatohepatitis can lead
to cirrhosis and liver cancer (Buzzetti et al., 2016).
The mechanisms driving NAFLD progression are not well un-
derstood, although it is generally agreed that there are at least
two components. First, cellular lipid deposits accumulate in the
liver. This is then followed by activation of immune cells and
production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (Dowman et al.,
2010). Nutritional, genetic, and epigenetic factors each play a
role
in
determining
whether
an
individual
with
steatosis
develops the more severe pathologies of fatty liver disease
(Eslam et al., 2018). Another emerging factor contributing to
NAFLD pathogenesis is dysbiosis of the intestinal microbiota.
Germ-free (GF) mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD) and inoculated
with bacterial isolates from feces of hyperglycemic mice
developed steatohepatitis, whereas GF mice fed the same
HFD but inoculated with bacteria from normoglycemic mice
only showed mild steatosis (Le Roy et al., 2013). A study
comparing intestinal microbiomes of children found subtle,
yet significant differences between children with obesity and
NASH (Zhu et al., 2013).
Several hypotheses have been put forth regarding the role of
dysbiosis (Schippa and Conte, 2014). One possibility is that dys-
biosis disrupts production of microbial metabolites that are
utilized by the intestinal epithelial cells for maintaining barrier
integrity, which could elevate bacterial endotoxins in circulation,
and trigger a pro-inflammatory cytokine cascade in the liver.
Another hypothesis is that dysbiosis leads to increased genera-
tion of toxic metabolic byproducts in the intestine and elevates
the chemical burden on the liver. A third hypothesis is that
dysbiosis leads to aberrant metabolism of dietary residues
(e.g., choline) and/or endogenous metabolites (e.g., bile acids),
which imapirs the export of lipids or elevates lipogenesis in the
liver. A common denominator of these hypotheses is that
progression toward steatohepatitis is linked to alterations in
the metabolic outputs of the intestinal microbiota. Recent find-
ings have shown that the microbiota produces bioactive metab-
olites that engage host cellular pathways to modulate immune

 cell fate and function (Sridharan et al., 2014) and lipid absorption
in the intestine (Ghazalpour et al., 2016). Microbial metabolites
have been detected in circulation (Wikoff et al., 2009), and the
liver (Vernocchi et al., 2016) and several of these metabolites
(e.g., indoxyl sulfate) are ligands for host receptors, such as
the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR). Studies in transgenic
animal models suggest that the AhR plays a significant role in
regulating lipid and fatty acid metabolism (Lee et al., 2010). In
mice, AhR activation negatively regulates several lipogenesis
enzymes, including fatty acid synthase (Fasn), and the choles-
terol metabolism regulator sterol regulatory element-binding
protein-1c (SREBP-1c) (Tanos et al., 2012). In humans, exposure
to the AhR ligand TCDD disrupts lipid and fatty acid metabolism
(Pelclova
´ et al., 2002).
The present study investigates the hypothesis that gut
microbiota dysbiosis perturbs the balance of immunomodula-
tory microbiota metabolites, and increases the susceptibility of
the liver to inflammation. We utilize a metabolomics approach
to identify microbiota-dependent metabolites that activate
the AhR and characterize their effects on liver inflammatory re-
sponses and metabolic function.
RESULTS
Microbiota-Dependent Metabolites in the Intestine
Include Tryptophan-Derived AhR Ligands
Cecal contents and fecal material from GF and conventionally
raised (CONV-R) mice were analyzed using both targeted and
untargeted liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry
(LC-MS/MS) experiments. Hierarchical clustering of detected
features showed qualitative differences between the two groups
(Figure 1A). The majority of the differentially present features
(60% of total) were reduced in GF samples, suggesting that
these features include products that depend on microbiota
metabolic activity (Figure 1B). In the fecal material, a majority
of differentially present features (36% of total) were elevated
in GF samples (Figure 1C), suggesting that these features
include dietary resides that could have been catabolized by the
intestinal microbiota or host intestinal enzymes activated by
the microbiota.
Of the 1,444 LC-MS/MS features depleted in both cecal con-
tents and fecal material from GF mice, we annotated 156
features with putative identities. The majority of these metabo-
lites are associated with phytochemical and lipid metabolism
pathways (Figures 1D and 1E). Other major categories are amino
acid derived compounds, nucleotides, vitamins, and cofactors.
Notably, these depleted metabolites include bioactive mole-
cules, such as indole-3-acetate (I3A) and tryptamine (TA)
(Figures 1F and 1G), which we previously found (Sridharan
et al., 2014) to activate the AhR in a breast cancer cell line.
HFD Alters the Levels of Microbiota-Dependent
Metabolites in Cecum, Serum, and Liver
Next, we investigated whether administering a HFD, which can
induce steatosis in mice following a prolonged feeding period
(Reid and Eksteen, 2015), alters the levels of microbiota-depen-
dent metabolites. The duration of HFD feeding was kept rela-
tively short to avoid substantially altering host physiology. Using
qRT-PCR, we confirmed that an 8-week HFD significantly per-
turbed the microbiota. The ratio of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes
was significantly higher in fecal material from HFD-fed mice
(8.62) compared to mice fed a low-fat diet (LFD) (0.82) (Fig-
ure S1A). No significant differences in liver triglyceride levels
were observed (data not shown).
Untargeted analysis of metabolites in the cecum, serum, and
liver (Figure S1B) did not show any obvious qualitative differ-
ences between HFD- and LFD-fed mice. However, a more
detailed examination of the LC-MS/MS data using hypothesis
testing for equal medians (Wilcoxon rank-sum test) followed by
feature annotation revealed significant differences in several
classes of metabolites (Figure 2A). The major classes are phyto-
chemicals, lipids, and amino-acid-derived compounds (Fig-
ure S1C). Intersecting the list of metabolites differentially present
in HFD and LFD mice with the list of metabolites differentially
present in GF and CONV-R mice identified 19 microbiota-depen-
dent metabolites that are consistently altered by the HFD in at
least two of the three tissue compartments (Figure 2C). This
panel of 19 metabolites was further narrowed to eliminate small
effect sizes (fold change < 2 between HFD and LFD mice).
Finally, searching the narrowed list for potential AhR ligands
identified three tryptophan metabolites: I3A, TA, and xanthurenic
acid (XA).
Targeted LC-MS/MS analysis for I3A and TA confirmed signif-
icant depletion of both metabolites in the liver and cecum of HFD
mice compared to LFD mice (Figure 2B). The decrease in TA
varied from 2- (cecum) to 10-fold (liver). Similarly, I3A decreased
between 3- (liver) and 10-fold (cecum). The concentrations of TA
and I3A in the LFD liver are 2 and 0.03 mM/g tissue, respectively.
HFD Increases Levels of Free Fatty Acids and Alters the
Composition of Primary Bile Acid Pool
Targeted analysis for major free fatty acid (FFA) species
confirmed significant increases in both saturated and unsatu-
rated fatty acids in liver, cecum, and serum of HFD mice
compared to LFD mice (Figure 3). In the liver, palmitic and stearic
acids were increased 4-fold. In the cecum, palmitic acid was
increased 10-fold, while stearic acid was unchanged (Figure 3B).
In serum, feeding with the HFD increased almost every major
FFA species (Figure 3C). The increases in serum FFAs largely
correlated with the composition of the HFD. The quantitatively
dominant FFAs in the diet are palmitic, oleic, linoleic, and stearic
acids (Figure 3D); these are also the four most abundant FFAs in
all three tissue compartments examined in this study.
In addition to increasing the FFA levels, HFD also altered the
composition of the primary bile acid pools in the liver, cecum,
and
serum.
Targeted
analysis
for
cholic
acid
(CA)
and
chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) found a significant (p = 0.013)
decrease in the relative pool size of CA in the liver of HFD mice
(Figure S1D).
I3A and TA Attenuate Pro-inflammatory Cytokine
Expression in Macrophages
In a previous study (Bansal et al., 2010), we found that the tryp-
tophan-derived bacterial metabolite indole attenuates indicators
of inflammation in epithelial cells. As inflammation is a key
secondary insult driving NASH, we investigated whether the
1100
Cell Reports 23, 1099–1111, April 24, 2018
 tryptophan metabolites decreased in HFD could attenuate
inflammation. Cultured macrophages were first exposed to pal-
mitic acid and then lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to mimic the
sequence of two key insults in NAFLD. Changes in the expres-
sion of tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a), interleukin-1b (IL-1b),
and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) in the pres-
ence of I3A and TA were determined (Figures 4A and 4B). Pre-
treating macrophages with I3A or TA prior to palmitate and
LPS exposure significantly attenuated the increase in the
mRNA levels of TNF-a, IL-1b, and MCP-1. Of the two metabo-
lites, I3A exhibited greater potency, reducing the expression of
all three cytokines in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 4A).

and fecal material (G) from GF mice.

 While TA pretreatment resulted in similar trends, only IL-1b
expression was significantly attenuated (Figure 4B). Moreover,
significant toxicity was observed at TA concentrations greater
than 500 mM. The trends for cytokine secretion were largely
consistent with gene expression (Figure 4C).
I3A and TA Inhibit Macrophage Migration to MCP-1
In addition to activation of resident macrophages, progression of
steatohepatitis is marked by increased infiltration of macro-
phages into the liver. Macrophage infiltration is promoted by
MCP-1, a chemokine that is increased in serum and liver of
NASH patients (Haukeland et al., 2006). Thus, we investigated
if I3A or TA alters migration of macrophages toward MCP-1.
Pretreatment of bone-marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs)
with I3A or TA prior to stimulation with MCP-1 significantly
decreased migration in a dose-dependent manner. At the high-
est concentrations tested in this study, I3A (1 mM) and TA
(500 mM) both completely abolished BMDM migration toward
MCP-1 (Figure 4D).
I3A Attenuates Effects of TNF-a and Fatty Acids in
Hepatocytes
Based on the above observation that I3A significantly attenuated
the production of inflammatory mediators in macrophages, we
examined whether I3A also modulated the metabolic response
of hepatocytes. We first confirmed that culturing AML12 cells
in medium supplemented with palmitic and oleic acids at a
high, but sub-toxic (Malhi et al., 2006), dose (500 mM) led to
accumulation of visible lipid droplets within 24 to 48 hr (Figures
5A–5C). A similar trend was observed in HepG2 cells, a human
liver cell line (Figures S2A–S2C), which accumulated noticeably
larger lipid droplets. We followed the fatty acid supplementation
with TNF-a treatment, taking this cytokine as a representative
pro-inflammatory signal produced by macrophages in the liver.
Targeted LC-MS/MS analysis of major fatty acid species
showed that the AML12 cells cultured in FFA-supplemented
medium contained 5-fold greater levels of intracellular palmitic
and oleic acids (Figures 6A–6C), suggesting that not all of the
FFAs taken up by the cells were stored into droplets. A similar
trend was observed for the HepG2 cells (Figures S2D–S2F). In
both AML12 and HepG2 cells, exposure to TNF-a increased
the intracellular levels of both palmitic and oleic acids, even
without fatty acid preconditioning. Combining the treatments
did not lead to an additive effect. Pretreating the cells with I3A
prior to TNF-a exposure significantly decreased the levels of
palmitic and oleic acids. Similarly, I3A treatment attenuated the
effects of fatty acid preconditioning, even when it was combined
with TNF-a.
Since a hallmark of liver inflammation in fatty liver disease is
dysregulation of bile acid metabolism (Chow et al., 2017), we
examined the effect of I3A on bile acid production. Targeted
LC-MS/MS analysis showed that fatty acid preconditioning
and TNF-a exposure independently and together increased the
fraction of CDCA by more than 30% in AML12 cells (Figure 6D).
A similar trend was observed for the HepG2 cells (Figure S2G).
By itself, I3A also increased the CDCA fraction, but when
combined with the other treatments, I3A reduced the CDCA
fraction by 20% compared to the conditions where the cells

 were exposed to either FFAs or TNF-a. However, I3A treatment
had no significant impact on cultures exposed to both TNF-a
with FFA. Similar trends were observed in HepG2 cell cultures
(Figure S2G); however, CA accounted for a larger share of the
bile acid pool in the control cultures and TNF-a exposure
increased the CDCA fraction by 40%. In HepG2 cells, I3A treat-
ment had a significant impact on bile acid levels even when both
FFA and TNF-a were present.
I3A Attenuates Hepatocyte Response to TNF-a
Based on the observation that I3A attenuates the both palmitic
acid- and TNF-a-stimulated fatty acid level increase, we more
broadly profiled the effects of I3A on hepatocyte metabolite
levels using untargeted LC-MS/MS analysis. Hierarchical clus-
tering (Figure S3A) suggested that I3A pretreatment was more
effective in reversing the metabolic alterations due to TNF-a
exposure compared to fatty acid preconditioning. A similar
trend
was
observed
when
the
metabolite
profiles
were
compared using partial least-squares discriminant analysis
(PLS-DA) (Figures S3B and S3C). The profiles of cells cultured
in fatty-acid-supplemented medium formed a distinct cluster
independent of I3A treatment, whereas the cells exposed to
TNF-a following I3A pretreatment clustered closely with vehicle
control.
I3A Modulates the Expression of Fasn and SREBP-1c via
Activation of the AhR
To investigate the impact of I3A on lipid and fatty acid pathways,
we measured the expression of a key lipogenesis enzyme, Fasn,
and a transcription factor regulating cholesterol/bile acid biosyn-
thesis, SREBP-1c. By itself, I3A treatment significantly reduced
the expression of Fasn in AML12 cells. This effect was also
observed when I3A treatment was combined with fatty acid

preconditioning and/or TNF-a exposure
(Figure 7A). The effect of I3A on Fasn at
the protein level was consistent with the
gene expression data (Figure 7B). Treat-
ment with TNF-a independently or in
conjunction with FFA increased Fasn
protein levels by 4-fold while independent
treatment with FFA did not significantly
alter Fasn. Treatment with I3A signifi-
cantly attenuated the effects of TNF-a
on Fasn by 2-fold. While fatty acid sup-
plementation increased SREBP-1c gene
expression, TNF-a exerted a weaker
effect (Figure 7C). Combining both treatments did not have a
significant effect compared to vehicle control.
Treatment with I3A again attenuated the effect of TNF-a or
fatty acid supplementation. We also tested the effects of I3A
on AhR gene expression and activation, which negatively
regulates both Fasn and SREBP-1c. Fatty acid supplementation
and TNF-a exposure, either individually or in combination, signif-
icantly reduced AhR gene expression compared to vehicle
control. Treatment with I3A attenuated the TNF-a-induced
reduction in AhR expression, regardless of fatty acid supplemen-
tation (Figure 7D). Treatment with I3A by itself had no significant
impact on AhR gene expression, suggesting that the effects of
I3A on AhR target genes are mediated through ligand activation
of the nuclear receptor. Activation of AhR by I3A was confirmed
in a H4IIE murine liver cell line expressing a stable enhanced
green fluorescent protein (EGFP) reporter regulated by a minimal
promoter containing xenobiotic response elements. At 10 mM or
higher doses, I3A increased EGFP expression by over 5-fold
compared to vehicle control (Figure 7E). To determine if the
observed effects of I3A are AhR-dependent, AML12 cells were
incubated with CH-223191, a potent antagonist of AhR (Zhao
et al., 2010), prior to I3A treatment. In the presence of the
inhibitor, I3A only weakly attenuated the TNF-a- or fatty acid
supplementation-induced increases in palmitic (Figure 7F) and
oleic acids (Figure 7G). In the case of oleic acid, incubation
with CH-223191 completely abrogated the effects of I3A.
DISCUSSION
A number of studies have shown that the gut microbiota
composition is altered in a HFD regimen, suggesting that this
dysbiosis could drive various phenotypic changes and progres-
sion of HFD-associated diseases, including fatty liver disease

 (Murphy et al., 2015). By co-analyzing the differences in the
metabolite profiles between HFD- and LFD-fed mice alongside
the differences between CONV-R and GF mice, we identified
metabolites that depend on the gut microbiota and are signifi-
cantly depleted under HFD. The metabolite profile comparisons
were only performed within the same sub-strain of mice
(C57BL/6J or C57BL/6N) to examine the effect of a single factor,
either diet or colonization.
The untargeted LC-MS/MS experiments detected a large
number of features differentially present in GF and CONV-R
mice (Figures 1A–1C). A subset of these features (26%) is
consistently depleted in both cecal luminal contents and fecal
material from GF mice and thus could be products of gut
microbiota metabolism. A common practice for annotating un-
targeted LC-MS/MS data is to match the MS/MS spectra of
the detected features to spectral libraries of reference data-
bases. Unfortunately, the coverage of bacterial metabolites
in these databases remains incomplete. Moreover, different
databases often return conflicting results. To address these
issues, we searched multiple databases and supplemented

tion analyses. A putative identity was
assigned only if two or more of the
data sources agreed. The identification
rate
achieved
in
the
present
study
(156/1,444)
is
comparable
to
other
global profiling studies, with the identi-
fied LC-MS/MS features broadly repre-
senting known categories of microbiota metabolites (Figures
2D–2E).
In order to determine which of the microbiota-dependent
intestinal metabolites could be altered in fatty liver disease, we
compared the metabolite profiles of liver, cecum, and serum
from HFD-fed mice against corresponding profiles from LFD-
fed mice. The HFD model has been extensively used to study
phenotypes associated with fatty liver disease in mice (Murphy
et al., 2015). It is generally accepted that a HFD typically leads to
simple steatosis and that steatohepatitis and fibrosis require
additional challenges, such as fructose supplementation (As-
gharpour et al., 2016). We limited the HFD to 8 weeks based
on previous reports (Kim et al., 2012) showing that this duration
is sufficient to significantly modify the gut microbiome, while
also elevating circulating levels of inflammatory cytokines,
without producing overt liver dysfunction. Targeted LC-MS/
MS experiments confirmed the impact of the HFD on cecum,
serum, and liver FFA profiles, in good agreement with previous
reports on similar HFD models (Kim et al., 2012; Pang et al.,
2016).

Cell Reports 23, 1099–1111, April 24, 2018
 Of the 156 putatively identified metabolites depleted in GF
mice, 19 were also depleted by the HFD in at least two of the
three tissue compartments. Querying this panel of metabolites
against the literature for previously reported bioactivity, specif-
ically ligand activation of the AhR, further narrowed the panel
to three metabolites (Figure 2C): XA, TA, and I3A. Enzymes for
producing TA (Williams et al., 2014) and I3A (Sridharan et al.,
2014) from tryptophan have been characterized in the gut
microbiota, whereas such enzymes have not yet been identified
for XA. Therefore, we focused on TA and I3A as likely microbiota
metabolites. The doses of TA and I3A were based on concentra-
tions measured in the liver, estimated to be 2 and 0.03 mM,
respectively, assuming a tissue density of 1 g/ml.
Multiple triggers can activate liver resident macrophages and
induce hepatic inflammation. One well-known trigger is expo-
sure to LPS. Increased bacterial translocation from the digestive
tract has been observed in NASH patients (Miele et al., 2009).
Another potential trigger is activation of toll-like receptors (e.g.,
TLR4) by elevated FFAs (Shi et al., 2006). Treating the cells
with both palmitate and LPS synergistically induced the produc-
tion of several pro-inflammatory cytokines. This finding is
consistent with an earlier study reporting that palmitate amplifies
the production of inflammatory cytokines (IL-6 and IL-8) upon
LPS stimulation (Schwartz et al., 2010) of in human THP-1 mono-
cytes. A similar observation was reported by Wen et al. (2011),
who showed palmitate induction of IL-1b secretion in LPS
primed macrophages. The synergistic effects of LPS and palmi-
tate could involve production of ceramides (Schilling et al., 2013),
which strongly induce lipotoxicity (Pagadala et al., 2012), or
inflammasome activation through AMP-activated protein kinase
(Wen et al., 2011). Both palmitate and LPS have been shown to
activate macrophages through TLR4 and nuclear factor-kB
(NF-kB) signaling (Shi et al., 2006), suggesting that signaling
from both stimuli could converge onto this classical inflammation
pathway. The addition of I3A or TA to the culture medium
significantly decreased palmitate and LPS induced cytokine
production in a dose-dependent manner (Figures 4A–4C).
Interestingly, TA shows greater potency than I3A in decreasing
TNF-a and MCP-1 secretion, but is less potent in decreasing
their gene expression. One possible explanation for this obser-
vation is that I3A and TA affect cytokine production at different
points.
Another source of hepatic inflammation in NASH is in-
creased infiltration of monocytes to the liver. Activated Kupffer
cells produce chemokines, including MCP-1, which recruit
multiple immune cells including monocytes (Tacke and Zim-
mermann, 2014). Accumulation of monocytes in the liver de-
pends on signaling between C-C chemokine receptor type 2
(CCR2) and MCP-1 (Tacke and Zimmermann, 2014), and
blocking this axis improves NASH in a murine model (Baeck
et al., 2012). Our results show that I3A and TA both inhibit
BMDM migration toward MCP-1 in a dose-dependent manner;
however, the mechanism for this inhibition remains to be eluci-
dated. While both I3A and TA exhibit the ability to attenuate
inflammation in macrophages, only I3A significantly attenuated
both gene expression and secretion of cytokines (Figure 4D).
Moreover, TA exhibited toxicity at higher doses. Based on
these observations, we focused on I3A for further in vitro
testing in hepatocytes.
Fatty acid supplementation has been used to mimic diet-
derived lipid accumulation in hepatocytes (Garcı
´a-Ruiz et al.,
2015), although these previous studies did not report visual evi-
dence for lipid droplets that characterizes steatosis. Here, we
used an imaging technique to confirm the presence of lipid
droplets in both murine (AML12) and human (HepG2) liver cell
lines. The HepG2 cell line was used to confirm that the fatty
acid supplementation and other treatments performed in the
study elicit a similar response in murine and human cells, since
the latter is in some cases not appropriately modeled by the
former. Targeted LC-MS/MS experiments confirmed significant
uptake of both palmitic and oleic acids in both cell types,
although at least a fraction these pools remained non-esterified
as FFAs.
While elevation of serum FFAs is an indicator of the meta-
bolic syndrome (Zhang et al., 2014), hepatic lipid accumulation
more specifically indicates NAFLD. Targeted analysis for major

 FFAs confirmed that palmitic, stearic, and myristic acids were
significantly elevated in livers of HFD-fed mice. The most
abundant unsaturated fatty acid measured in our study is
oleate, although its level in the liver was not significantly
altered by the HFD. Palmitic acid can act as an inflammatory
signaling molecule, whereas oleic acid is a quantitatively
important substrate for esterification and promotes lipid accu-
mulation through modulation of SREBP-1c activity (Ricchi
et al., 2009). We supplemented the culture medium of hepato-
cytes with both fatty acids to induce lipid loading and present
an inflammatory stimulus.
Two common denominators of NAFLD are lipid accumula-
tion and elevation of pro-inflammatory factors in the liver. Lipid
accumulation occurs primarily in hepatocytes, whereas pro-
inflammatory cytokines are produced by resident and/or infil-
trating macrophages (Stojsavljevi�
c et al., 2014). We found
that FFA exposure along with LPS synergistically promotes
TNF-a, IL-1b, and MCP-1 production and secretion by macro-
phages. We selected TNF-a as a representative cytokine to
mimic the effects of local macrophage activation on hepato-
cytes. In both AML12 and HepG2 cells, TNF-a significantly
increased the levels of intracellular FFAs. Similar observations
were reported in vivo by Endo et al. (2007), who found that
induction of TNF-a expression through LPS injection in mice
significantly enhances the expression of SREBP-1c and Fasn
and elevates liver steatosis. We show that the effects of
TNF-a are nearly abolished by treating the cells with I3A. Treat-
ment with I3A also attenuated the effects of TNF-a on bile acid
metabolism. Clinical studies (Aranha et al., 2008; Chow et al.,
2017) have suggested that an alteration in both serum and
liver bile acid compositions could be a biomarker for NAFLD;

to CA, which was partially reversed by

treatment,

suggesting
a
normalization of lipid metabolism.
While the mechanism whereby I3A counters the effects of
TNF-a on lipid metabolism remains to be fully elucidated, our re-
sults, together with previously reported findings, point to activa-
tion of the AhR. We, and others (Hubbard et al., 2015; Jin et al.,
2014; Sridharan et al., 2014), have shown that I3A is an agonist
for the AhR in several cell types, including hepatocytes (Fig-
ure 7D). The present study shows that I3A also modulates the
expression of two AhR regulated genes, SREBP-1c and Fasn,
in a manner consistent with ligand activation of AhR. Rats admin-
istered the AhR agonist TCDD exhibited decreased fatty acid
synthesis in the liver (Lakshman et al., 1988). Liver-specific
knockout (KO) of AhR exacerbated the effects of a HFD on liver
steatosis, inflammation, and lipotoxicity (Wada et al., 2016). The
same study also found increased de novo lipogenesis in AhR KO
mice. Conversely, TNF-a appears to interfere with transcriptional
regulation by the AhR (Gharavi and El-Kadi, 2005). However, the
mechanism remains to be elucidated, and conflicting findings
have been reported in other cell types (e.g., MCF7 cells) (Drozd-
zik et al., 2014).
The protective role of the AhR in NAFLD likely depends on the
degree of activation and the cellular context. Gorski et al. (1988)
reported that TCDD increased fatty acid synthesis in rat livers
when administered at a very high dose (10-fold higher than
Lakshman et al. [1988]). We observed similar dose dependence
in both murine and human hepatocytes. At the highest dose
(500 mM), we found that I3A by itself increased the levels of
both palmitic and oleic acids compared to vehicle control, an ef-
fect we did not observe at lower doses (data not shown). On the
other hand, I3A consistently lowered intracellular palmitic and
oleic acids when presented together with FFAs, TNF-a, or both.
One possible explanation for these different findings is that nega-
tive regulation of lipogenesis by the AhR depends on whether the
nuclear receptor is activated in a naive state or in a heightened
state of inflammation when expression of AhR is suppressed.

Cell Reports 23, 1099–1111, April 24, 2018
 Of the two ‘‘hits’’ applied in the present study, I3A more
strongly attenuated the effects of TNF-a. Hierarchical clustering
(Figure S3A) and PLS-DA of untargeted LC-MS/MS data indicate
that the global metabolite profiles of I3A and TNF-a-treated cells
(Figure
S3B)
more
closely
resemble
the
vehicle
control
compared to I3A- and FFA-treated cells (Figure S3C). Interest-
ingly, treatment with I3A alone led to a metabolite profile that is
distinct from the vehicle control, suggesting that this metabolite
has broad effects on cellular metabolism. While our results indi-
cate that these effects are at least partially mediated by the AhR,
the involvement of other regulatory pathways cannot be ruled
out. Furthermore, the stronger attenuation of TNF-a effects
could reflect the timing of I3A treatment, which preceded TNF-
a exposure and followed FFA supplementation.
In conclusion, we have shown that the gut microbiota-depen-
dent metabolite I3A can directly modulate inflammatory re-
sponses of hepatocytes and macrophages. Our results suggest
that I3A could modulate liver inflammatory responses in at least
two ways. Acting on the macrophages, I3A could attenuate the
release of pro-inflammatory cytokines that induce the liver to
synthesize FFAs, which in turn stimulate the macrophages.
Acting on the hepatocytes, I3A could attenuate the cytokine-
mediated upregulation in lipogenesis. These actions of I3A on

the hepatocytes are AhR-dependent, as
inhibition of AhR by a specific antagonist
suppressed the effects of I3A. The AhR
is likely but one of several host cellular re-
ceptors mediating host-microbiota cross-
talk. In this regard, the approach pre-
sented in this paper could serve as a
useful template to characterize other mi-
crobiota-dependent ligands and their ef-
fects on specific host cell types and path-
ways.
Finally,
further
studies
are
warranted in animal models and human
subjects to determine whether I3A or
other microbiota metabolites can effectively intervene in the
pathogenesis of NAFLD.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Reagents
RAW 264.7, AML12, and HepG2 cells were purchased from ATCC (Manassas,
MA, USA). DMEM, alpha minimal essential medium (aMEM), RPMI-1640, peni-
cillin/streptomycin, PBS, TRIzol, RNase-free water, DNase-free water, LPS
(from Salmonella minnesota), and fetal bovine serum (FBS) for culture of
HepG2 and AML12 cells were purchased from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA,
USA). FBS for culture of RAW 264.7 was purchased from Atlanta Biologicals
(Flowery Branch, GA). Insulin-transferrin-selenium (ITS) was purchased from
Thermo Fisher Scientific (Waltham, MA, USA). The AhR inhibitor CH-223191
was developed in the Sherr lab at Boston University. H1G1.1c3 reporter cells
were obtained from the Denison lab at UC Davis and utilized in the Sherr lab.
Unless otherwise noted, all other reagents were purchased from Sigma Aldrich
(St. Louis, MO, USA).
Comparison of GF and Conventionally Raised Mice
To screen for intestinal metabolites that depend on the microbiota, we per-
formed untargeted and targeted analysis of cecal contents and fecal material
collected from conventionally raised (CONV-R) and GF female C57BL/6N
mice. The mice were purchased from Taconic (Albany, NY, USA) at 6 weeks
of age and immediately sacrificed by euthanasia upon receipt at Texas A&M
Health Science Center. Cecal contents and fecal material were collected as
Cell Reports 23, 1099–1111, April 24, 2018

 described previously (Sridharan et al., 2014) and stored at �80�C until further
analysis.
Sample Collection from Mice Fed a Low- or High-Fat Diet
Two groups of male C57BL/6J mice 14 weeks of age were purchased from
Jackson labs. One group (n = 5) was initially raised on a LFD consisting of
10% calories from fat (D12450B, Research Diets, New Brunswick, NJ) until
6 weeks of age, after which the mice were fed a HFD consisting of 60%
calories from fat (D12492, Research Diets), whereas the other group (n = 5)
continued on a LFD. Mice from both groups had access to the respective diets
during transit and prior to sacrifice (within 16 hr of receipt). Mice were sacri-
ficed by euthanasia, and blood was collected via heart puncture and centri-
fuged at 4,000 3 g for 30 min to obtain serum. The liver was quickly excised,
rinsed with 10x volume of ice-cold PBS, flash frozen in liquid nitrogen, and
weighed. Cecal contents were gently squeezed out of the excised cecum
into cold tubes and flash frozen. Serum, liver, and cecal content samples
were stored at �80�C until further analysis. All animals were handled in accor-
dance with the Texas A&M University Health Sciences Center Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee guidelines under an approved animal use
protocol (2015-0346).
HepG2 and AML12 Hepatocyte Culture
HepG2 cells were seeded into 12-well plates at a density of �1.25 3
105 cells/cm2 and cultured in a humidified incubator at 37�C and 5% CO2.
The culture medium was low-glucose DMEM supplemented with 10% (v/v)
heat-inactivated FBS, penicillin (200 U/mL), and streptomycin (200 mg/mL).
The medium was changed every 24 hr for 3 days after seeding. AML12 cells
were seeded into 12-well plates at a density of �1.25 3 105 cells/cm2 and
cultured in a humidified incubator at 37�C and 5% CO2. The culture medium
was a 1:1 mixture of DMEM and Ham’s F12 medium supplemented with
5 mg/mL insulin, 5 mg/mL transferrin, 5 ng/mL selenium, 40 ng/mL dexameth-
asone, 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated FBS, 1.2 g/L sodium bicarbonate, penicillin
(200 U/mL), and streptomycin (200 mg/mL). The medium was changed every
24 hr until the culture reached �80% confluence. For a ‘‘one-hit’’ inflammation
model, the cells were treated for 24 hr with dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) or 10,
100, or 500 mM I3A or TA and then treated with either DMSO or 25 ng/mL
TNF-a for another 24 hr. For a ‘‘two-hit’’ steatosis and inflammation model,
the cells were grown for 48 hr in medium supplemented with 0.5 mM palmitic
acid and 0.5 mM oleic acid, then treated for 24 hr with DMSO or 500 mM I3A,
and finally treated for 24 hr with vehicle or 25 ng/mL TNF-a. The AhR inhibitor
CH-223191 was prepared as a stock solution of 20 mM in DMSO. AML12 cul-
tures were dosed with either 1 mL of inhibitor solution or 0.1% DMSO 10 min
prior to I3A treatment and again 10 min prior to TNF-a treatment.
Murine Macrophage Culture
Raw 264.7 murine macrophages were seeded into 24-well plates at a density
of 4 3 105 cells/ml and cultured in a humidified incubator at 37�C and 5% CO2.
The culture medium was DMEM supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated
FBS, penicillin (200 U/mL), and streptomycin (200 mg/mL). Cells were pre-
treated with different concentrations of I3A or TA for 4 hr, followed by addition
of 300 msM palmitate complexed with BSA. After 18 hr, 10 ng/mL LPS was
added to the culture medium. The cells were then incubated for an additional
6 hr. BMDMs were isolated from the femur of wild-type C57/BL6 mice as pre-
viously described (Ying et al., 2013). The isolated progenitor cells were resus-
pended in RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 10 ng/mL macrophage
colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) (Invitrogen), seeded in polystyrene dishes,
and incubated for 3 days at 37�C and 5% CO2 in a humidified incubator.
The culture medium was replenished on day 3, and the cells were incubated
for an additional 4 days. At the end of the 7-day culture period, > 95% of the
cells were positive for macrophages markers F4/80 and CD11b.
Metabolite Extraction
Metabolites were extracted from tissue samples using a solvent-based
method. Liver tissue samples were weighed and placed into a pre-cooled
garnet bead beating tube followed by adding 500 mL ice cold methanol and
250 mL ice-cold chloroform. After homogenization (6,500 rpm for 30 s), the
sample tube was centrifuged under refrigeration at 700 3 g for 10 min. The
supernatant was then transferred to a new tube through a 70-mm cell strainer;
1 mL ice-cold water was added; and the sample centrifuged at 3,700 3 g for
10 min. The upper and lower phases were each separately transferred into new
tubes while taking care not to disturb the interface. The liver tissue pellet was
extracted again with ice-cold methanol (500 mL). The polar phases from both
extractions were combined and concentrated using a centrifugal evaporator
(Vacufuge, Eppendorf, Hauppauge, NY, USA). Metabolites from cecal content
samples were extracted as described above without the homogenization step.
Serum metabolites were extracted as previously described (Wikoff et al.,
2009). Extracted samples were concentrated using the Vacufuge and stored
at �80�C until analysis. Prior to metabolite analysis, the samples were recon-
stituted in 100 mL methanol/water (50% v/v).
Untargeted Metabolomics
The extracted samples were analyzed for global metabolite profiles using in-
formation-dependent acquisition (IDA) experiments (Tables S1 and S5)
performed on a triple-quadrupole time-of-flight (TOF) instrument (AB Sciex
5600+). Raw data were processed in MarkerView (v. 1.2, AB Sciex) to deter-
mine the ion peaks. The peaks were aligned based on accurate mass (m/z)
and retention time (RT) (30 ppm and 2.5 min tolerance, respectively) and
then filtered based on intensity (100 cps threshold) to eliminate low-quality
peaks. An additional filter was applied to retain only monoisotopic ions. The re-
maining ions were organized into a feature table, with each feature specified by
m/z and RT. In the case a precursor ion detected by the TOF survey scan trig-
gered an MS/MS scan, the corresponding MS/MS spectrum was extracted
from the product ion scan data and added to the feature table. Each feature
was searched against spectral libraries in METLIN (Smith et al., 2005) and
HMDB (Wishart et al., 2007) and analyzed using in silico fragmentation tools
MetFrag (Wolf et al., 2010) and CFM-ID (Allen et al., 2014). In some cases,
the database search or in silico analysis returned more than one matching
compound for a given feature. In these cases, the highest-ranked match
was selected as the search result. The search results from all four sources
were used together to assign a putative identity (ID) to the features. An ID
was categorized as a confident assignment, if the search results for the feature
were consistent across at least one experimental database and one other data
source.
Targeted Analysis of Bile Acids and Fatty Acids
The extracted samples were analyzed for specific metabolites (I3A, TA, bile
acids, and fatty acids) using product ion experiments performed on the Triple-
TOF instrument (Tables S1, S2, S3, and S4). Metabolite-specific parameters
for product ion scans were determined from runs using high-purity chemical
standards.
Metabolite Quantitation
For each metabolite with a confirmed or putative identity, the corresponding
peak in the ion chromatogram was integrated using MultiQuant (v.2.1, AB
SCIEX) to determine the area under the curve (AUC). For comparisons of
metabolite levels between samples, fold changes were calculated based on
the AUC values normalized to the corresponding tissue weight (liver and
cecum samples) or DNA content (in vitro cell culture samples). Cellular DNA
content was measured using Hoechst dye.
RNA Extraction and qRT-PCR
Cells were washed with PBS and stored at �80�C until RNA extraction. Total
RNA was extracted from RAW 264.7 cells using the EZNA Total RNA Kit
(Omega Bio-Tek, Norcross, GA, USA). RT-PCR analysis was carried out using
the qScript One-Step PCR Kit (Quanta Biosciences, Gaithersburg, MD, USA)
on a LightCycler 96 System (Roche, Indianapolis, IN, USA). For hepatocytes
and AML12 cells, RNA was extracted using TRIzol (Invitrogen). Total RNA
was reverse-transcribed using the SuperScript III First-Strand Synthesis
System (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Quantification of RNA was performed using
Brilliant II SYBR Green qPCR Master Mix (Agilent Technologies) on a Strata-
gene Mx3000P qPCR System (Agilent Technologies). Fold change values
were calculated using the 2�DDCt method, with b-actin and GAPDH as
the housekeeping genes for macrophages and hepatocytes, respectively.
The primer sequences are listed in Table S6.

 Proteomics
Proteins were extracted from cell lysates, purified, digested, and analyzed
using LC-MS/MS experiments as described previously (Manteiga and Lee,
2017). An IDA scan was used to generate an ion library in ProteinPilot (v.5.1,
AB Sciex) of all proteins and their corresponding peptides in the sample,
and a data-independent acquisition (DIA) scan was used to obtain high-quality
MS/MS data for quantification.
Cytokine Quantification
Raw 264.7 cells were treated with I3A or TA for 4 hr, palmitate for 18 hr, and
followed by LPS for another 24 hr. Culture supernatants were centrifuged at
5,000 x g for 15 min and secreted cytokines were quantified using a multiplex
kit (Mouse Inflammation Panel, BioLegend, San Diego, CA, USA) using the
manufacturer’s suggested protocol.
Macrophage Migration Assay
BMDM migration was investigated in transwell cell culture chambers with
polycarbonate membranes (8-mm pore size, Corning Costar, Corning, NY,
USA). Cells were added to the upper chamber, and either vehicle or different
concentrations of I3A or TA was added to both the upper and the lower
chambers. After 4 hr, 20 ng/mL MCP-1 (Invitrogen) was added to the bottom
chamber. After 24 hr, cells remaining on the upper side of the membrane
were scraped off with a cotton swab. The migrated cells in the bottom
chamber were fixed with methanol for 15 min, stained with 0.1% crystal violet
for 30 min, and counted under a microscope (Axiovert 200M, Zeiss). Three
replicate wells were analyzed in each experiment, with cells counted in 15
randomly chosen fields of view per well.
AhR Ligand Activation Assay
A previously described AhR reporter assay (Nagy et al., 2002) using murine
H1G1.1c3 hepatoma cells was adapted to test ligand activation of the AhR
by I3A and TA. These experiments were performed at the Sherr lab. Indoxyl
sulfate (IS) and 6-formylindolo(3,2-b)carbazole (FICZ) were used as positive
controls. Fluorescence readings were recorded at 24 and 48 hr using a plate
reader (SpectraFluor Plus, Tecan, Ma
¨ nnedorf, Switzerland). Relative fluores-
cence as a measure of induced AhR activity was calculated by subtracting
the average background fluorescence of untreated cells from the experimental
values.
CARS Microscopy
Lipid accumulation in hepatocytes grown in fatty-acid-supplemented medium
was visualized using coherent anti-stokes Raman scattering (CARS) micro-
scopy. Images were recorded every 24 hr by tuning the Stokes (1,064 nm)
and pump (817 nm) beams to excite the Raman peak at 2,845 cm�1
(663 nm) corresponding to the CH2 stretch in lipid molecules. The microscopy
system was configured to detect both forward- and epi-CARS signals. All
images were averaged over 64 frames. Overlays of forward- (green) and epi-
CARS (red) signals were generated using raw images (LAS X Software
v.3.0.2, Leica Microsystems).
Statistical Analysis
Metabolite level comparisons from in vivo data were performed using the Wil-
coxon rank-sum test. Statistical significance of in vitro data was calculated us-
ing one-way ANOVA for single treatment comparisons and two-way ANOVA
for multiple treatment comparisons. A p value of less than 0.05 was considered
statistically significant. All heatmaps were generated using pareto-scaled
data. The similarity of the metabolite profiles was assessed based on group
centroid distances using PLS-DA. Ellipses in PLS-DA plots indicate 95%
confidence regions for each treatment group.
