Despite the high incidence of neuropathic and inflammatory pain
worldwide, effective drugs with few side effects are currently
unavailable for the treatment of chronic pain. Recently, researchers
have proposed that inhibitors of purinergic chemical transmission,
which plays a key role in the pathological pain response, may allow
for targeted treatment of pathological neuropathic and inflamma-
tory pain. However, such therapeutic analgesic agents have yet to
be developed. In the present study, we demonstrated that clodro-
nate, a first-generation bisphosphonate with comparatively fewer
side effects than traditional treatments, significantly attenuates
neuropathic and inflammatory pain unrelated to bone abnormali-
ties via inhibition of vesicular nucleotide transporter (VNUT), a key
molecule for the initiation of purinergic chemical transmission. In
vitro analyses indicated that clodronate inhibits VNUT at a half-
maximal inhibitory concentration of 15.6 nM without affecting
other vesicular neurotransmitter transporters, acting as an allosteric
modulator through competition with Cl−. A low concentration of
clodronate impaired vesicular ATP release from neurons, microglia,
and immune cells. In vivo analyses revealed that clodronate is more
effective than other therapeutic agents in attenuating neuropathic
and inflammatory pain, as well as the accompanying inflammation,
in wild-type but not VNUT−/− mice, without affecting basal nocicep-
tion. These findings indicate that clodronate may represent a unique
treatment strategy for chronic neuropathic and inflammatory pain
via inhibition of vesicular ATP release.

lthough acute nociception is an important biological warning
system, chronic neuropathic and inflammatory pain may re-
sult from nerve injury, inflammation, or other pathological pro-
cesses (1–4). Although the incidence of chronic pain is estimated
at 20–25% worldwide (1, 4), optimal drug treatment regimens with
few side effects have yet to be developed. Common inflammatory
pain medications, such as nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs
(e.g., cyclooxygenase inhibitors), may cause side effects, such as
gastrointestinal and renal dysfunction (5). Notably, opioids exert a
strong analgesic effect against inflammatory pain but are associ-
ated with severe side effects, such as drug addiction, drowsiness,
and vomiting (6, 7). Moreover, these drugs are ineffective for
neuropathic pain. Drugs for neuropathic pain, which include
voltage-dependent Ca2+ channel inhibitors, such as the anticon-
vulsants pregabalin and gabapentin, also have severe side effects,
such as drowsiness and edema (8).
Pathological nociception is associated with purinergic chem-
ical transmission (9). Vesicular nucleotide transporter (VNUT/
SLC17A9) carries ATP into secretory vesicles in a membrane
potential (Δψ)- and Cl−-dependent manner (10–12), is expressed
in neurons at primary afferent nerve terminals and in the dorsal
horn of the spinal cord, and is responsible for vesicular storage
and release of ATP (13–15). Upon depolarization-evoked stim-
ulation, released ATP binds to purinoceptors, which, in turn,
cause pain responses (9). Experiments in VNUT knockout (KO)
(VNUT−/−) mice have revealed that VNUT in spinal dorsal horn
neurons is involved in neuropathic pain (13), and that VNUT
inhibition leads to improvement of pathological conditions with no
significant changes in phenotype (12). Such findings suggest that
VNUT inhibitors may be effective analgesic agents with few side
effects, although therapeutic inhibitors of purinergic chemical
transmission have yet to be developed.
Bisphosphonates are widely used as therapeutic agents for os-
teoporosis; however, studies have demonstrated that bisphospho-
nates also have analgesic properties. Although they are used to
treat bone diseases accompanied by chronic neuropathic or in-
flammatory pain (16–18), the mechanism underlying this analgesic
effect is unknown. Notably, non–nitrogen-containing bisphospho-
nates (first generation) result in less inhibition of bone resorption
but have fewer side effects than nitrogen-containing bisphospho-
nates (second and third generations) (19–21) (Fig. S1). Therefore,
we hypothesized that non–nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates,
Significance
Although the incidence of chronic pain is estimated at 20–25%
worldwide, optimal drug treatment regimens with few side ef-
fects have yet to be developed. In this study, we demonstrated
that clodronate is a potent and selective inhibitor of vesicular ATP
release that attenuates neuropathic and inflammatory pain un-
related to bone abnormalities. Clodronate was more effective
and associated with comparatively fewer side effects than
existing drugs. Thus, the nonopioid agent clodronate may rep-
resent a unique treatment strategy for chronic pain via inhibition
of vesicular ATP release, suggesting that clodronate may be ef-
fective in the treatment of several diseases involving purinergic
chemical transmission, including inflammatory diseases, diabetes,
and neurological disorders. Our study identifies a transporter-
targeted analgesic drug.

 which produce effects similar to the beneficial phenotypes ob-
served in VNUT−/− mice, are candidate therapeutic drugs for
chronic pain that may act via VNUT inhibition.
In the present study, we demonstrate that clodronate, a non–
nitrogen-containing bisphosphonate, is a potent and selective
inhibitor of VNUT in vivo. In addition, our findings indicate that
clodronate-evoked inhibition of vesicular ATP release is im-
portant for the treatment of chronic neuropathic and inflam-
matory pain, as well as the accompanying inflammation.
Results
Clodronate Is a Selective and Potent Inhibitor of VNUT. To identify
the targets of the first-generation bisphosphonates clodronate and
etidronate, we used a quantitative transport assay system involving
proteoliposomes containing only purified protein (22, 23). The
cDNAs of vesicular neurotransmitter transporters or SLC17 trans-
porters were cloned into Escherichia coli or baculovirus expression
vectors, and overexpressed in E. coli or insect cells. The membrane
fractions were solubilized, and the transporters were purified via
nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA) affinity column chromatogra-
phy. The final fractions contained major protein bands of the
expected apparent molecular masses, as determined via staining with
Coomassie Brilliant Blue (Fig. 1A).
These purified proteins were incorporated into proteoliposomes,
following which the inhibitory effects of the first-generation
bisphosphonates on these transporters were examined. We observed
that at half-maximal inhibitory concentration of 15.6 nM, clodronate
exerted a stronger inhibitory effect on VNUT-mediated ATP uptake
than etidronate (Fig. 1B). Neither clodronate nor etidronate
exhibited strong inhibitory effects on other vesicular neurotrans-
mitter transporters or SLC17 family transporters (Fig. 1B). Our cis-
inhibition analysis also indicated that clodronate was the strongest
VNUT inhibitor among the bisphosphonates examined (Fig. 2).
Clodronate Is an Allosteric Modulator of VNUT Cl− Dependence. We
further examined the mechanism underlying the inhibitory effect
of clodronate on VNUT-mediated ATP uptake. Exposure to a
high concentration of clodronate had no effect on the Δψ, based
on oxonol-V fluorescence quenching (Fig. 3A). An analysis of Cl−
dependency for ATP uptake revealed no change in ATP transport
following exposure to up to 2 mM Cl−: ATP uptake markedly
increased following treatment with 3–7 mM Cl− and plateaued
beyond 8 mM Cl− (Fig. 3B). Notably, Cl−-dependent VNUT ac-
tivation exhibited strong positive cooperativity for ATP transport,
with a Hill coefficient of ∼3 for Cl− (Fig. 3C). Clodronate shifted
Cl− concentration toward a higher activation level, suggesting a
competitive interaction (Fig. 3 B and C). Photoaffinity labeling for
ATP binding showed results almost identical to the results
obtained for ATP transport-mediated substrate specificity (Fig.
S2), and was not inhibited by either clodronate or etidronate (Fig.
3D). In addition, keto acids, such as acetoacetate or glyoxylate,
which are known to inhibit SLC17 transporters in a Cl−-dependent
manner (23, 24), did not inhibit ATP binding (Fig. 3D). These
effects of clodronate were completely reversible (Fig. 3E).
Clodronate Modulates Vesicular ATP Release. ATP is primarily re-
leased from neurons, astrocytes, and microglia via VNUT-
mediated exocytosis (12, 25–28). Previous studies have demon-
strated that depolarization-dependent ATP release from neu-
rons is inhibited by tetanus neurotoxin or the cell-permeable
Ca2+ chelator EGTA-tetraacetoxymethyl ester (AM), both of
which are known inhibitors of exocytosis (25). In the present
study, we observed complete inhibition of such ATP release
following treatment with a low concentration (100 nM) of
clodronate, compared with the concentration described for bone
resorption inhibition (29) (Fig. 4A). In a parallel experiment,
1 μM clodronate did not inhibit glutamate release, suggesting
that clodronate selectively inhibits vesicular ATP release (Fig. 4B).
The effects of clodronate on ATP release were also completely
reversible (Fig. 4A). Previous researchers have proposed various
mechanisms of astrocytic ATP release, such as those mechanisms
involving vesicular transporter or plasma membrane channel-
mediated pathways (9, 26). In the present study, depolarization-
dependent ATP release from astrocytes was inhibited by tetanus
neurotoxin, the extracellular Ca2+ chelator EGTA, and EGTA-
AM, supporting the notion that astrocytic ATP release occurs
via a vesicular mechanism (26) (Fig. 4C). However, our findings
indicate that neither ATP nor glutamate release from astrocytes
was inhibited by clodronate, even at 1 μM (Fig. 4 C and D). In
microglia, ATP release is known to be inhibited by botulinum
neurotoxin A or the cell-permeable Ca2+ chelator O,O′-bis(2-
aminophenyl)ethyleneglycol-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid-AM (27).
In the present study, we also observed that a low concentration of
clodronate resulted in complete inhibition of vesicular ATP release
from microglia, similar to the effect observed in neurons (Fig. 4E).
To examine the accessibility of bisphosphonate to neurons and
astrocytes, we measured the uptake of a commercially available
radiolabeled bisphosphonate. Na+-dependent bisphosphonate
transport activity was detected in neurons but not astrocytes, and
this activity was completely inhibited by clodronate and inorganic

 phosphate (Pi), suggesting that Pi transport involves bisphosphonate
uptake into neurons (Fig. 4F). We further examined the gene ex-
pression pattern of Na+-dependent phosphate transporters, which
physiologically consist of the SLC20 and SLC34 families, between
neurons and astrocytes (30). However, no neuron-specific signals
were detected, suggesting that cellular uptake of bisphosphonate
occurs via a novel phosphonate transporter or other transport
mechanisms (Fig. S3).
Clodronate Controls Chronic Inflammatory Pain Through VNUT. We
analyzed the effects of clodronate on inflammatory and neuro-
pathic pain unrelated to bone abnormalities. Approximately 40%
attenuation of carrageenan- or complete Freund’s adjuvant
(CFA)-evoked inflammatory pain was observed following in-
jection of 10 mg/kg clodronate (Fig. 5 A and B and Fig. S4 A
and B). In addition, VNUT−/− mice exhibited reduced hyperalgesia
relative to wild-type controls, and the analgesic effect of clodro-
nate was lost in VNUT−/− mice (Fig. 5 A and B and Fig. S4 A and
B). Notably, clodronate did not alter baseline sensory thresholds
(Fig. 5 C and D). Clodronate-mediated analgesia was stronger than
the analgesic effect induced by acetaminophen and diclofenac (first-
choice drugs), and comparable to analgesia of the nonnarcotic opioid
tramadol in the therapeutic range (Fig. 5 E and F and Fig. S4 C and
D). Etidronate, which exerted a lower inhibitory effect of VNUT,
had no analgesic effect (Fig. 5 E and F and Fig. S4 C and D).
VNUT-Mediated Immune Control by Clodronate. Immune cells con-
tribute to chronic inflammatory pain through the release of in-
flammatory mediators and infiltration of inflammatory cells (31).
In the human monocyte cell line THP-1 (32), clodronate inhibited
vesicular ATP release in a manner similar to the vesicular ATP
release observed in neurons, suggesting that clodronate exerts an
antiinflammatory effect (Fig. 6 A and B). In vivo, carrageenan-
evoked or CFA-evoked hind-paw edema was attenuated following
exposure to clodronate, but not to etidronate (Fig. 6 C and D and
Fig. S5 A and B). The antiinflammatory effect of clodronate was
stronger than the effect of diclofenac in the therapeutic range,
comparable to the maximal effect of the moderate steroid hydro-
cortisone and to the effect of the strong steroid prednisolone in the
therapeutic range (Fig. 6D and Fig. S5B). Glucocorticoids exert a
strong antiinflammatory effect but can cause a wide range of severe
side effects, such as metabolic dysfunction (diabetes, hyperlipid-
emia, and osteoporosis) and increased susceptibility to infections
(33). In VNUT−/− mice, carrageenan- or CFA-evoked hind-paw
edema was also attenuated to ∼70% of the edema observed in
wild-type controls (Fig. 6 C and D and Fig. S5 A and B). Moreover,
the inflammatory response was decreased in VNUT−/− mice com-
pared with the inflammation observed in wild-type controls (Fig.
S5C). Notably, TNF-α and IL-6 were detected in the blood after
carrageenan injection, and the release of these cytokines was
strongly inhibited by clodronate (Fig. 6 E and F). Similarly, VNUT−/−
mice exhibited markedly decreased blood cytokine levels compared
with wild-type controls (Fig. 6 E and F). Release of inflammatory
mediators from THP-1 cells was inhibited by apyrase (ATP
diphosphohydrolase) or suramin (nonselective inhibitor of puri-
noceptors), suggesting that cytokine release requires autocrine
ATP release (Fig. S6).
VNUT-Mediated Chronic Neuropathic Pain Control by Clodronate.
Approximately 60% attenuation of neuropathic pain was ob-
served after a prior clodronate injection at a dose lower than the
dose used for inflammatory pain (Fig. 7A). VNUT−/− mice also
exhibited reduced hyperalgesia compared with wild-type controls,
and this analgesic effect of clodronate was lost in VNUT−/− mice
(Fig. 7A). The analgesic effect of clodronate was stronger than
analgesia induced by pregabalin and gabapentin (Fig. 7 B and C),
both of which are in widespread clinical use. Some bisphosphonates
attenuate the neuropathic pain associated with complex regional
pain syndrome 1 in conditions involving bone abnormalities (16). In
the present study, bisphosphonate compounds other than clodro-
nate exerted weak or no analgesic effects, similar to their inhibitory
effects on VNUT, suggesting that the analgesic effect of other
bisphosphonates depends on the inhibition of bone resorption (Fig.
7B). The analgesic effect of clodronate has both fast- and long-
acting properties compared with the effect of pregabalin and
gabapentin and was completely reversible, suggesting that clodro-
nate at this dose is not toxic and is without side effects (Fig. 7C).
Notably, pregabalin at the effective dose (0.1–10 mg/kg) seemingly
induced drowsiness and reduced exploratory behavior, although
these effects were not observed for clodronate, even at a dose of
10 mg/kg (Movie S1). Although pregabalin did not induce drowsi-
ness at a dose of 0.001 mg/kg, administration at this dose did not
attenuate neuropathic pain (Fig. 7C).
Moreover, previous studies have indicated that clodronate-
containing liposomes induce macrophage apoptosis by selective
delivery of a high concentration of clodronate into macrophages
(34), which may be involved in the clodronate analgesic effect.
However, as expected, the low concentration of clodronate

 (10 mg/kg) did not induce apoptosis of blood cells, including
macrophages (Fig. 7 D and E). Similarly, low concentrations of
clodronate, which resulted in complete inhibition of vesicular
ATP release, did not induce apoptosis in neurons, astrocytes,
microglia, or THP-1 cells. As expected, clodronate-containing
liposomes induced complete apoptosis in phagocytic microglia
and THP-1 cells, but not in neurons or astrocytes (34, 35) (Fig.
S7). Recent reports have suggested that ATP is also stored in
microglial lysosomes in a VNUT-mediated manner, and that
inhibition of this process leads to cell death (36). Although
lysosomal storage of ATP in microglia was inhibited by clodr-
onate, clodronate did not induce microglial apoptosis, sug-
gesting the existence of other functions of lysosomal ATP
release (Fig. S8).
Finally, the pathogenesis of neuropathic pain, but not in-
flammatory pain, is thought to involve VNUT (13). Our analysis
revealed that VNUT is involved in pathological inflammatory pain
in two well-characterized models. Consistent with the findings of a
previous study (13), we observed that basal nociception and
weak inflammation with less chronicity were not affected by
clodronate in an inflammatory pain model (one-fourth volume
of CFA compared with Figs. S4 and S5) (Fig. S9). These obser-
vations strongly suggest that VNUT inhibition improves chronic
pathogenesis more extensively than pain under physiological
conditions.
Discussion
Previous attempts to develop new therapeutic drugs for the
treatment of chronic neuropathic and inflammatory pain with
reduced side effects have been unsuccessful. In the present study,
we observed that clodronate is a potent and selective inhibitor of
vesicular storage and release of ATP, which is mediated by al-
losteric modulation at the VNUT Cl− binding site. In vivo,
clodronate was more effective than other agents in attenuating
chronic neuropathic and inflammatory pain and the accompa-
nying inflammation without affecting basal nociception in wild-
type mice. Consistent with these observations, VNUT−/− mice
exhibited reductions in chronic pain and inflammation, for which
clodronate was ineffective. These observations indicated that
clodronate-evoked
inhibition
of purinergic
chemical
trans-
mission is important for the treatment of neuropathic and in-
flammatory pain with reduced side effects. Furthermore, the
present study identifies a transporter-targeted analgesic and
antiinflammatory drug.
Cl− dependency is a unique feature of SLC17 transporters (23).
VNUT-mediated ATP transport is activated by Cl−, and this ac-
tivation is inhibited competitively and reversibly by keto acids,
such as acetoacetate and glyoxylate (23, 24). Regulation of the
metabolic anion switch between Cl− and keto acids safely controls
purinergic chemical transmission in response to changes in met-
abolic state. However, keto acids are metabolized in the body,
and they do not show high specificity among SLC17 transporters

 (∼10-fold) (23, 24). Our findings suggest that clodronate is the
strongest allosteric modulator of VNUT Cl− dependence, because
the stoichiometric ratio of VNUT protein in proteoliposomes and
clodronate was 1:1, with no change in the Hill coefficient for Cl−
even in the presence of clodronate (Figs. 1 and 3). Although
regulation of Cl− is highly conserved in both mammals and plants
(37), clodronate has been shown to interact selectively with VNUT
Cl− binding sites. Because the VNUT inhibitory effects of halogen
atoms from the characteristic bisphosphonate groups are corre-
lated with VNUT activation in a halogen-dependent manner, the
chlorines of clodronate may bind to the VNUT Cl− binding site,
and the bisphosphonate skeleton may enhance affinity to this
binding site (10) (Fig. 2 and Fig. S1). Further structural studies of
VNUT are required to clarify this structure–activity relationship.
We elucidated two significant phenotypes associated with the
loss of vesicular ATP release using clodronate and VNUT−/−
mice. First, VNUT was involved in pathological neuropathic and
inflammatory pain in vivo (Figs. 5 and 7). Although VNUT gene
defects were not associated with basal nociception and weak
inflammation with low chronicity, VNUT contributed to chronic
hyperalgesia (∼40–60% of the total). Consistent with these ob-
servations, a recent study has reported that VNUT gene ex-
pression in the spinal cord is significantly up-regulated in
pathological conditions (13). The study further reported that
VNUT in spinal dorsal horn neurons, but not in astrocytes and
microglia, is responsible for the pathogenesis of neuropathic
pain, suggesting that VNUT may be an important target for the
treatment of neuropathic pain (13). In the present study, clodr-
onate was consistently taken up by neurons, inhibiting neuronal
vesicular ATP release and thereby attenuating neuropathic pain
(Figs. 4 and 7). Our results strongly support the notion that
VNUT is involved in the pathogenesis of not only neuropathic
pain but also inflammatory pain, and that a specific inhibitor may
serve as an extensive and effective analgesic drug in this patient
population. Further studies are required to clarify in vivo VNUT
function in primary afferent nerve terminals of the spinal dorsal
horn, which may be involved in inflammatory pain.
Second, our study demonstrates that VNUT is involved in the
immune response in vivo (Fig. 6). We propose that the following
mechanism underlies the antiinflammatory effect of VNUT inhibition:

Clodronate (Clo) inhibits vesicular ATP release from neurons. KCl-dependent release of ATP (A) and glutamate (B) from cultured neurons after 20 min
was assayed in the presence (gray bars) or absence (filled bars) of the indicated Clo concentrations. Inhibition due to 100 nM Clo was fully reversed after
washing the cultured neurons. For the washout experiments, Clo-treated cells were washed with medium and incubated for an additional 24 h (n = 4–8). KCl-
dependent release of ATP (C) and glutamate (D) from cultured astrocytes after 20 min was assayed in the presence (gray bars) or absence (filled bars) of the
indicated concentration of Clo. ATP release from cultured astrocytes was assayed in the presence of 15 μg/mL tetanus neurotoxin (TeNT), 1 mM EGTA, or 50 μM
EGTA-AM (open bars) (n = 3–8). (E) Ca2+-dependent ATP release from cultured microglia after 5 min was assayed in the presence (gray bars) or absence (filled bar)
of the indicated concentration of Clo (n = 4–5). (F) Alendronate uptake into cultured neurons or astrocytes for 10 min in the presence (gray bars) or absence (filled
bar) of 100 μM or 1 mM Clo or 1 mM Pi (n = 4–6). Data are mean ± SEM (**P < 0.01, one-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett’s test). NS, not significant.

 VNUT is also localized in secretory vesicles in immune cells (e.g.,
monocytes, macrophages, T cells) and is responsible for vesicular
storage and release of ATP (32, 38). Released ATP or degraded
ADP and adenosine bind to various purinoceptors in an autocrine
or paracrine manner, stimulating the release of inflammatory
mediators and thus leading to inflammation (39). We observed
that clodronate completely inhibited the release of ATP from
immune cells and reduced blood levels of inflammatory mediators,
such as TNF-α and IL-6, which are released mainly from macro-
phages and T cells (Fig. 6). These observations indicated that
VNUT is a key molecule for the induction of pathological pain
and inflammation, and that VNUT inhibition is therefore essential
for improving pathological symptoms.
Because purinergic chemical transmission is involved in dis-
ease pathogenesis (9), clodronate-evoked purinergic chemical
transmission blockade may be effective in the treatment of sev-
eral chronic diseases, including chronic auto-inflammatory dis-
eases, diabetes, and neurological disorders, among others. It
should be stressed that the therapeutic effects of clodronate were
stronger than the effects of widespread drugs for neuropathic
pain, such as pregabalin or gabapentin (Fig. 7C). In addition,
these effects were comparable to the effects of widespread drugs
for inflammatory pain or inflammation, such as tramadol or
prednisolone, in the therapeutic range (Figs. 5 E and F and 6D).
However, tramadol and prednisolone are associated with severe
side effects, strongly suggesting that clodronate is promising for
the treatment of intractable diseases associated with abnormal-
ities in purinergic transmission, with few side effects. Notably,
VNUT−/− mice exhibit an improvement in blood glucose ho-
meostasis, insulin sensitivity, and other pathological conditions,
with no significant changes in phenotype (12). These observations
suggest that clodronate may improve a wide range of diabetic
symptoms, such as neuropathic pain, inflammation, hyperglyce-
mia, and insulin sensitivity. Because no effective drugs or therapies
for these diabetic symptoms have yet been developed (40), further
studies regarding the wide range of applications of clodronate are
currently in progress in our laboratories.
In summary, our findings indicate that clodronate selectively
and robustly inhibits VNUT and can safely regulate purinergic
chemical transmission in vivo, thereby attenuating pathological
neuropathic and inflammatory pain and the accompanying in-
flammation in conditions without bone abnormalities. Notably,
clodronate is approved for clinical use in the treatment of osteo-
porosis in many countries, and its clinical safety in humans is well
established (21). Therefore, it is important to evaluate analgesic
effects of clodronate for painful diseases independent of bone
abnormalities in humans. Given its potency and the side effects of
existing analgesics, clodronate, a nonopioid and nonsteroidal drug,
might serve well as a novel analgesic or antiinflammatory drug.
Materials and Methods
Animal experiments were performed in accordance with the guidelines set
by the Animal Care and Use Committees of Okayama University and Aji-
nomoto Co., Inc. All experiments were carried out in accordance with the
approved institutional guidelines. Additional information on experimental
methods is included in SI Materials and Methods.
Expression and Purification of Transporters in E. coli. Vesicular neurotrans-
mitter transporters were expressed and purified as previously described (22).
Briefly, E. coli C43 (DE3) cells were transformed with the expression vectors
and grown in Terrific Broth medium containing 30 μg/mL kanamycin sulfate
at 37 °C. E. coli cells were grown until A600 reached 0.6–0.8, following which
isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of
1 mM, followed by incubation for a further 16 h at 18 °C. The cells were then
harvested by centrifugation and suspended in buffer consisting of 70 mM

 Tris·HCl (pH 8.0), 100 mM NaCl, 10 mM KCl, 15% glycerol, and 2 mM PMSF.
The cell suspension was then disrupted by sonication with a TOMY UD200 tip
sonifier (OUTPUT4) and centrifuged at 5,856 × g at 4 °C for 10 min to remove
large inclusion bodies and cell debris. The resultant supernatant was carefully
collected and centrifuged again at 150,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The pellet was
suspended in the same buffer, and the protein concentration was adjusted to
10 mg/mL. The membranes were then treated with 2% Fos-choline 14 (Affy-
metrix) and centrifuged at 150,000 × g at 4 °C for 1 h. The supernatant con-
taining recombinant protein was obtained and diluted twofold with buffer
consisting of 70 mM Tris·HCl (pH 8.0), 100 mM NaCl, 10 mM KCl, 15% glycerol,
and 2 mM PMSF, following which it was applied to a column containing 1 mL of
Ni-NTA Superflow resin (Qiagen) equilibrated with buffer consisting of 70 mM
Tris·HCl (pH 8.0), 100 mM NaCl, 10 mM KCl, and 15% glycerol. After incubation
for 3 h at 4 °C, the column was washed with 20 mL of washing buffer consisting
of 70 mM Tris·HCl (pH 8.0), 20 mM imidazole, 100 mM NaCl, 10 mM KCl, 20%
glycerol, and 0.1% n-decyl-β-D-thiomaltopyranoside (DTM; Affymetrix). The
protein was eluted with 3 mL of buffer consisting of 20 mM Tris·HCl (pH 8.0),
250 mM imidazole, 100 mM NaCl, 10 mM KCl, 20% glycerol, and 0.1% DTM,
following which it was stored at −80 °C, at which temperature it was stable
without loss of activity for at least a few months.
Reconstitution. Aliquots of 20 μg of purified protein were mixed with 550 μg
of liposomes and frozen at −80 °C for at least 15 min. The mixture was
thawed quickly by holding the sample tube in the hand and diluted 60-fold
with reconstitution buffer containing 20 mM 3-(N-morpholino)propane-
sulfonic acid (MOPS)–Tris (pH 7.0), 150 mM sodium acetate, and 5 mM
magnesium acetate. The buffer composition was altered as necessary.
Reconstituted proteoliposomes were pelleted via centrifugation at
200,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C and then suspended in 0.2 mL of reconstitution
buffer. Asolectin liposomes were prepared as previously described (37).
Soybean lecithin (10 mg/mL, Type IIS; Sigma) was suspended in buffer con-
taining 20 mM MOPS-NaOH (pH 7.0) and 1 mM DTT. The mixture was son-
icated until clear in a bath-type sonicator and stored at −80 °C until use.
In another experiment, 20 μg of VMAT2 was mixed with liposomes (550 μg
of lipid), frozen at −80 °C, and left at this temperature for at least 15 min.
The mixture was diluted 60-fold with reconstitution buffer containing
40 mM MES-Tris (pH 5.7), 150 mM potassium acetate, and 5 mM magnesium
acetate. Reconstituted proteoliposomes were pelleted via centrifugation at
200,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C and then suspended in 0.2 mL of reconstitution buffer.
Transport Assay. The reaction mixture (130 μL) consisting of 0.3 μg of protein
incorporated into proteoliposomes, 20 mM MOPS-Tris (pH 7.0), 140 mM potas-
sium acetate, 5 mM magnesium acetate, 10 mM KCl, and 2 μM valinomycin, as
well as 100 μM [3H] ATP (0.5 MBq/μmol; PerkinElmer), 100 μM [2,3-3H] L-glutamate
(0.5 MBq/μmol; PerkinElmer), 100 μM [2,3-3H] L-aspartate (0.5 MBq/μmol;
PerkinElmer), 100 μM [2,3-3H] GABA (0.5 MBq/μmol; PerkinElmer), or 100 μM
p-[glycyl-2-3H] p-aminohippuric acid (0.5 MBq/μmol; PerkinElmer), was in-
cubated at 27 °C. At the indicated time points, the proteoliposomes were
separated from the external medium using centrifuge columns containing
Sephadex G-50 (fine) to terminate transport. The radioactivity in the eluate
was measured via liquid scintillation counting (PerkinElmer).
For serotonin transport by VMAT2, proteoliposomes containing VMAT2
(0.3 μg of protein) were incubated in 20 mM MOPS-Tris (pH 7.5), 140 mM
potassium acetate, 5 mM magnesium acetate, 10 mM KCl, and 10 μM [2-3H]
serotonin (0.5 MBq/μmol; PerkinElmer) at 27 °C.
ATP and Glutamate Release from Neurons, Astrocytes, and Microglia. Primary
cultured neurons or astrocytes (2.0 × 105 cells per 3.5-cm dish) were washed
three times with Krebs–Ringer bicarbonate buffer composed of 128 mM
NaCl, 1.9 mM KCl, 1.2 mM KH2PO4, 1.3 mM MgSO4, 26 mM NaHCO3, 10 mM
D-glucose, 10 mM Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.4), 2.4 mM CaCl2, and 0.2% (wt/vol)
BSA. After the cells had been incubated in Krebs–Ringer bicarbonate buffer
at 37 °C for 3 h, 55 mM KCl was added to stimulate ATP and glutamate

 release. After incubation at 37 °C for 20 min, aliquots were collected and the
amount of ATP was measured using an ATP bioluminescent assay kit (Sigma–
Aldrich), whereas the amount of glutamate was measured via HPLC on a
COSMOSIL5 C18-ARII column (4.6 × 150 mm; Nacalai Tesque) and fluores-
cence detection, as previously described (12). In primary cultured microglia
(1.0 × 104 cells per 96-well plate), 5 μM Ca2+ ionophore A23187 was added to
stimulate ATP release. Aliquots were collected after 5 min, and the amount
of ATP was measured. The addition of clodronate at our experimental
concentration exerted no impact on the ATP bioluminescence assay. The
slopes of the standard curves in the absence and presence of clodronate at
10 μM were as follows: 96.4 ± 9.0 and 92.8 ± 5.7 relative luminescence unit/
fmol of ATP, respectively (n = 3, not significant in two-tailed paired
Student’s t test).
Plantar Test. The plantar test was performed as previously described (41).
C57BL/6 mice (male, weighing 22–30 g at the time of the test) were accli-
matized to an elevated acrylic observation chamber (14.0 × 17.0 × 11.0 cm)
for 60 min before the plantar test. Heat hyperalgesia was assessed using a
Hargreaves radiant heat apparatus (Ugo Basile). The heat source, a mobile
infrared photobeam, was positioned under the plantar surface of the left
hind paw. The cutoff was set to 20 s to prevent tissue damage in untreated
control mice. Clodronate was injected i.v. via the tail vein 60 min before the
plantar test in a volume of 100 μL per 10 g of body weight. We calculated
the percent maximum possible effect = [(PL − BL2)/(BL1 − BL2)] × 100, where
BL1 represents baseline latency before inflammation, BL2 represents base-
line latency after inflammation but before drug injection, and PL represents
latency after drug injection.
The von Frey Test. The von Frey test was performed as previously described
(41). C57BL/6 mice (male, weighing 22–30 g at the time of the test) were
acclimatized to an elevated metal mesh floor chamber (10.0 × 16.0 × 9.0 cm)
for 60 min before the von Frey test. Mechanical hyperalgesia was assessed by
measuring the left hind-paw withdrawal response to stimulation with a
series of von Frey filaments (0.04–2.0 g; Aesthesio) presented perpendicular
to the plantar surface. We determined the 50% paw withdrawal threshold using
Dixon’s up-down method (42). Clodronate was injected i.v. via the tail vein
60 min before the von Frey test in a volume of 100 μL per 10 g of body weight.
