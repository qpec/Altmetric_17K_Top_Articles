It has been proposed that autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is associated with difficulties
perceiving the internal state of one's body (i.e., impaired interoception), causing the socio-
emotional deficits which are a diagnostic feature of the condition. However, research in-
dicates that alexithymia e characterized by difficulties in recognizing emotions from in-
ternal bodily sensations e is also linked to atypical interoception. Elevated rates of
alexithymia in the autistic population have been shown to underpin several socio-
emotional impairments thought to be symptomatic of ASD, raising the possibility that
interoceptive difficulties in ASD are also due to co-occurring alexithymia. Following this
line of inquiry, the present study examined the relative impact of alexithymia and autism
on interoceptive accuracy (IA). Across two experiments, it was found that alexithymia, not
autism, was associated with atypical interoception. Results indicate that interoceptive
impairments should not be considered a feature of ASD, but instead due to co-occurring
alexithymia.

Introduction
Interoception, the perception of the internal state of one's
body, has been relatively neglected by clinical psychology and
neuroscience. However, there is renewed interest in inter-
oception, driven by biologically-grounded predictive coding
models of interoception (Seth, 2013) and realization of the
clinical relevance of atypical interoception (Bird & Cook, 2013).
Atypical interoception has been associated with various ill-
nesses, such as obesity, anxiety and depression (Barrett &
Simmons, 2015), but perhaps the most well-developed inter-
oceptive theory is that autism spectrum disorder (ASD),
particularly the social symptoms characteristic of the disor-
der, is a result of (oxytocin-mediated) interoceptive dysfunc-
tion (Quattrocki & Friston, 2014).
The limited empirical evidence as to the interoceptive
ability of those with ASD provides equivocal evidence for the

 interoception account of ASD however, with studies demon-
strating both impaired and enhanced interoceptive ability in
this population. Fiene and Brownlow (2015) found that
autistic1 adults report significantly lower body and thirst
awareness relative to neurotypical controls, leading them to
conclude that “adults with ASD reported a unified hypo-
reactivity to elements of the interoceptive sense” (Fiene &
Brownlow, 2015, p. 715). Garfinkel et al. (2016) also report
that adults with ASD show impaired interoception, and
speculate that this leads to impaired emotional sensitivity and
anxiety in ASD. In contrast, however, using an objective
measure of interoception in which participants are asked to
count their heartbeats (Schandry, 1981), children with ASD
showed enhanced rather than diminished interoception
relative to a neurotypical control group (Schauder, Mash,
Bryant, & Cascio, 2015).
While both hyper- and hypo-sensitivity to interoceptive
signals may be consistent with Quattrocki and Friston's (2014)
interoception account, there are other factors which may have
led to the inconsistent results concerning interoceptive ability
in ASD. For example, the superior heartbeat counting perfor-
mance demonstrated by the autistic children in Schauder
et al.'s (2015) study
Q1
was only demonstrated at the longest
test durations, raising the possibility that their enhanced
performance was due to non-specific factors, such as the
increased attention to counting tasks or enhanced time
perception demonstrated by children with autism (e.g.,
Wallace & Happ�
e, 2008). Of most relevance to the present
study, however, is the fact that previous studies do not ac-
count for the elevated levels of alexithymia in the autistic
population.
Alexithymia is characterized by difficulties in recognizing
emotions from internal bodily sensations. Its prevalence in
the general population is relatively low (10%; Salminen,
Saarij€
arvi,
€
A€
arel€
a,
Toikka,
&
Kauhanen,
1999),
yet alexithymia frequently co-occurs in individuals with ASD
(50%; Hill, Berthoz, & Frith, 2004). Elevated levels of alex-
ithymia are also reported in a variety of psychiatric (Bird &
Cook,
2013)
and
neurological
(Ricciardi,
Demartini,
Fotopoulou, & Edwards, 2015) conditions. Importantly, how-
ever, alexithymia is a completely independent construct, with
its own etiological and neurocognitive basis (Fitzgerald &
Molyneux, 2004). Although the precise neurocognitive mech-
anisms underlying alexithymia remain under investigation,
there is good evidence to suggest e given the reliance of
interoception on emotion (Clark, 2013; Seth, 2013; Wiens,
2005) e that alexithymia is associated with impaired inter-
oception (Herbert, Herbert, & Pollatos, 2011). Interestingly, it
may be the case that alexithymia is associated with increased
attention to bodily signals, at least according to self-report
data (Ernst et al., 2014), making the reduced interoceptive
accuracy (IA) in the condition even more striking.
In addition, there is a growing body of research showing that
co-occurring alexithymia underpins several socio-emotional
atypicalities (e.g., empathic deficits, emotion recognition diffi-
culties) once regarded as features of ASD (Bird, Press, &
Richardson, 2011; Bird et al., 2010; Cook, Brewer, Shah, & Bird,
2013; Foulkes, Bird, G€
okc
¸en, McCrory, & Viding, 2015; Silani
et al., 2008). In line with this evidence, Brewer, Happ�
e, Cook,
and Bird (2015) propose that, where observed in ASD, signs of
atypical interoception are due to co-occurring alexithymia.
Under this account, the interoceptive impairments previously
observed in groups with ASD would be due to the fact that the
ASD group contained more alexithymic individuals than the
control group.
As such, it remains unclear whether atypical interoception
is associated with ASD or alexithymia, or whether each con-
dition has an independent impact on interoceptive ability. In
addition, this question needs to be addressed while control-
ling for other clinical traits previously reported to be associ-
ated with IA (see Farb et al., 2015), and by ensuring that any
relationship between ASD and interoception is not due to non-
specific factors such as attention or time estimation (TE)
ability. In Experiment 1 we therefore sought to examine the
relative impact of alexithymia and autism on IA, while con-
trolling for depression, anxiety, body mass index (BMI), sus-
tained attention and TE ability.
2.
Experiment 1
2.1.
Method
2.1.1.
Participants
Thirty-eight adults (20 female) without a psychiatric diagnosis
aged between 19 and 75 years (Mage ¼ 29.1 years, SD ¼ 12.7)
participated
in
the
study.
Participants
had
normal
or
corrected-to-normal vision, and provided informed consent.
Ethical clearance was granted by the local committee. Partic-
ipants were recruited from a local database to ensure an
adequate range of scores on trait measures of autism and
alexithymia (see Section 2.1.2.4).
2.1.2.
Measures & procedure
2.1.2.1. INTEROCEPTION. The Heartbeat Tracking task (Schandry,
1981) was used to measure interoception. Participants were
seated upright in a quiet room and were required to close their
eyes and silently count their heartbeats during four intervals
of varying duration (25, 35, 45, and 100 sec). The order of in-
tervals was randomized across participants. Heartbeat signals
were acquired using a finger pulse oximeter (Contec Systems
CMS-50Dþ; Qinhuangdao, China) attached to the index finger,
while the other arm was at rest. Participants were instructed
not to measure their pulse by any means other than
“concentrating on their heart beats”.
2.1.2.2. TE. It has been suggested that performance on the
Heartbeat Tracking task may be influenced by one's ability to
estimate an elapsed time interval, and neural correlates of
interoception and time duration overlap within insular cortex
(Wittmann, 2013). While in the position described above
(Section 2.1.2.1), participants were therefore instructed to
judge the duration of three randomized intervals (19, 37 and
49 sec, e.g., Ainley, Brass, & Tsakiris, 2014).
1 The use of the term ‘autistic’ is endorsed by many individuals
with ASD (see Kenny et al., 2015). We therefore use this term as
well as language preferred by clinical professionals (e.g., ‘in-
dividuals with autism’) to respect the wishes of autistic in-
dividuals and report the study in line with scientific parlance.

 2.1.2.3. ANTHROPOMETRICS. Participants' height and weight were
measured to calculate BMI.
2.1.2.4. QUESTIONNAIRE MEASURES. Participants completed the 20-
item Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20; Bagby, Parker, &
Taylor, 1994), autism-spectrum quotient (AQ; Baron-Cohen,
Wheelwright, Skinner, Martin, & Clubley, 2001), beck depres-
sion inventory (BDI-II; Beck, Steer, & Brown, 1996), and the
Spielberger state/trait anxiety inventory (STAI; Spielberger,
Gorsuch, Lushene, Vagg, & Jacobs, 1983). State anxiety was
measured immediately before the Heartbeat Tracking task.
2.1.3.
Scoring and data analysis
IA was taken as performance on the Heartbeat Tracking task
(Garfinkel, Seth, Barrett, Suzuki, & Critchley, 2015). Perfor-
mance was quantified on a scale between 0 and 100% using the
following
transformation:
1=4 Pð1 � ð
�
�recorded number
of heartbeatsinterval � counted number of heartbeatsinterval
�
�=
recorded heartbeatsintervalÞÞ � 100. Higher scores are indicative
of better IA. TE score was also computed on a scale of 0e100%
using
this
formula:
1=3 Pð1 � ðjactual elapsed
time � estimated elapsed timej=actual elapsed timeÞÞ � 100.
Higher scores are indicative of better TE ability.
2.2.
Results and discussion
All measures were found not to differ significantly from a
normal distribution (KolmogoroveSmirnov tests, all ps > .24)
and there were no significant outliers. IA ranged between
12.70 and 98.80% (M ¼ 69.12%, SD ¼ 19.78%), consistent with
previous studies that have used this task. Performance on the
TE
task
followed
a
similar
distribution
(M
¼
73.13%,
SD ¼ 22.81%), indicating that it was matched in difficulty to
the Heartbeat Tracking task and therefore an appropriate
control measure.
Correlational analyses showed that alexithymia (TAS-20
score) was associated with IA (r ¼ �.36, p ¼ .025). In contrast,
there was no correlation between IA and autistic traits (AQ
Score; r ¼ �.09, p ¼ .59), TE score, depression, BMI, state or trait
anxiety measures (see Supplemental materials; Table S1).
TAS-20 scores were, in line with previous research (e.g., Cook
et al., 2013), correlated with AQ (r ¼ .56, p < .001). Participant
age was correlated with autistic traits (r ¼ .57, p < .001) and
alexithymia (r ¼ .35, p ¼ .034). Data were therefore entered into
a hierarchical regression analysis to test the relative contri-
bution of trait autism and alexithymia to IA, while controlling
for age, sex, depression, anxiety, BMI, TE, and alexithymia and
autism, respectively.
Participant age (years), sex (1 ¼ male; 2 ¼ female), depres-
sion score, state and trait anxiety scores, TE score and BMI
were entered into the first step of the regression model,
alexithymia scores in the second step, and autism scores in
the third. Trait anxiety scores were predictive of IA at a trend
level (b ¼ .50, t ¼ 1.92, p ¼ .066), but no other variables in the
first step reached significance (other ps > .10). When alex-
ithymia was added (step 2), it was found to be predictive of IA
(b ¼ �.47, t ¼ �2.64), and significantly increased the variance in
IA accounted for by 16.4%, F(1,27) ¼ 6.95, p ¼ .014. Conversely,
the addition of autistic trait scores (step 3) did not improve the
model,
leading
to
a
non-significant
increase
of
.2%,
F(1,26) ¼ .07, p ¼ .80, while alexithymia remained the only
significant predictor of IA, b ¼ �.45, t ¼ �2.20, p ¼ .037. We ran
a further hierarchical regression, entering autistic traits in
step 2 and alexithymia in step 3. Here, autistic traits failed to
significantly improve the model, accounting for an additional
4.7% of the variance in IA. Adding alexithymia led to a sig-
nificant change in R2, increasing the explained variance by
11.8%, F(1,26) ¼ 4.86, p ¼ .037.
These results suggest that alexithymia, and not autism, is
associated with impaired IA. Autistic traits failed to explain a
significant proportion of variance in IA. In contrast, and as
predicted by the ‘alexithymia hypothesis’ (Brewer et al., 2015),
trait alexithymia was associated with IA, even after account-
ing for autistic traits and other variables that have previously
been associated with IA.
However, it could be argued that autistic traits in the gen-
eral population are not a valid proxy to estimate the perfor-
mance of individuals with a clinical diagnosis of ASD (Ruzich
et al., 2015) validated by gold-standard research diagnostic
tools [e.g., autism diagnostic observation schedule e ADOS;
Lord et al., 2000]. Experiment 2 addressed this potential
limitation.
3.
Experiment 2
3.1.
Introduction and method
In Experiment 2, we recruited nineteen adults diagnosed with
ASD by an independent clinician and a control group of age-,
gender-,
and
IQ-matched
neurotypical
individuals
(see
Supplemental materials). Autism severity was quantified in
the autistic group using the ADOS, on which all participants
met criteria for ASD. Autistic traits were found to be signifi-
cantly higher in the ASD than in the control group. Each group
contained individuals with (TAS-20 score of �61), and without,
alexithymia, such that the two groups were closely matched
on this dimension (Supplemental materials; Table S2). It was
predicted that there would be no group difference in IA e
because the groups were matched for alexithymia e but that
alexithymia would predict IA. Methods were as used in
Experiment 1.
3.2.
Results and discussion
All measures were found not to differ significantly from a
normal distribution (KolmogoroveSmirnov tests, all ps > .16).
There
was
no
significant
difference
between
the
ASD
(M ¼ 81.96%, SD ¼ 14.16%) and control (M ¼ 74.91%,
SD ¼ 19.78%) groups on TE, t(36) ¼ 1.26, p ¼ .21, d ¼ .41,
consistent with previous evidence for intact time perception
in ASD (e.g., Wallace & Happ�
e, 2008). Most importantly, there
was no group difference on IA, t(36) ¼ .79, p ¼ .43, d ¼ .26
(Fig. 1A). Within the ASD group, the correlations between
ADOS score and IA (r ¼ �.22, p ¼ .38) or TE (r ¼ .18, p ¼ .45) were
not significant. Similarly, there was no relationship between
autistic traits and IA in either group (ASD: r ¼ �.05, p ¼ .85;
control: r ¼ �.27, p ¼ .27). See Supplemental materials (Table
S3) for other correlations.

http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cortex.2016.03.021
 Results are consistent with Experiment 1 and support the
prediction that, if groups are matched for alexithymia, ASD is
not
associated
with
impaired
interoception.
Following
Experiment 1, alexithymia was highly correlated with IA,
r ¼ �.64, p < .001 (Fig. 1B), with little correlation between the
AQ and IA (r ¼ �.20, p ¼ .23). TAS-20 scores were again
correlated with AQ (r ¼ .37, p ¼ .024), although participant age,
in this sample, was not correlated with autistic traits (r ¼ .26,
p ¼ .12) or alexithymia (r ¼ .14, p ¼ .41).
We performed the same regression analysis described in
Experiment 1 with the addition of IQ in the first step of the
hierarchical regression. No variables in the first step reached
significance (all ps > .12). When alexithymia was added to the
model it was found to be predictive of IA (b ¼ �.64, t ¼ �4.13),
significantly increasing the variance accounted for by 28.8%,
F(1,27) ¼ 17.03, p < .001. The addition of autistic traits failed to
improve the model, leading to a non-significant increase of
1.4%, F(1,26) ¼ .83, p ¼ .37, while alexithymia remained the only
significant predictor of IA, b ¼ �.56, t ¼ �3.12, p ¼ .004. When
autistic trait scores were entered in step 2 and alexithymia in
step 3, autistic trait scores significantly improved the model,
F(1,27) ¼ 6.03, p ¼ .021, accounting for an additional 13.6% of the
variance in IA. Importantly, however, in step 3, alexithymia
was a significant predictor of IA, b ¼ �.56, t ¼ �3.12, p ¼ .004,
while autistic trait scores were no longer predictive (p ¼ .37).
Furthermore, the addition of alexithymia led to a significant
change in R2, increasing the variance in IA accounted for by
16.6%, F(1,26) ¼ 9.76, p ¼ .004. These results are consistent with
and extend those of Experiment 1: Groupwise comparisons and
regression analyses converged to indicate that alexithymia,
and not autism, is associated with impaired interoception.
4.
General discussion
The present study examined the relative impact of autism and
alexithymia on interoception. A well-established measure of
IA, together with a TE control procedure was used, and a
number of clinically relevant variables previously reported to
be related to interoception were recorded. In a non-clinical
sample, autistic traits were unrelated to IA. In contrast, alex-
ithymia was e even after accounting for confounding vari-
ables e a significant predictor of IA (Experiment 1). It was then
found that, after controlling for alexithymia, there is no evi-
dence for impaired interoception in ASD (Experiment 2).
Furthermore, alexithymia was the strongest predictor of IA,
above and beyond demographic variables and other factors
potentially related to interoception.
These results represent an important contribution to the
growing literature on interoceptive difficulties in autism,
alexithymia and other clinical conditions. The correlation
between alexithymia and interoception in the non-clinical
sample (r ¼ �.36; Experiment 1) matched that from a larger
non-clinical study (r ¼ �.37, n ¼ 155; Herbert et al., 2011).
Collapsing across the ASD and control groups, this relation-
ship was even larger in Experiment 2, presumably because of
increased variance in alexithymia. This is consistent with
findings that neural systems supporting interoception (e.g.,
Critchley, Wiens, Rotshtein, €
Ohman, & Dolan, 2004) may be
atypical in people with alexithymia (Ernst et al., 2014). The
robustness of the relationship between alexithymia and
interoception, and the lack of an association between inter-
oception and ASD, suggests that previous findings of reduced
interoceptive ability in ASD are, in fact, a consequence of the
greater proportion of alexithymic individuals in the ASD
population. It supports Brewer et al.'s (2015) suggestion that,
where observed in ASD, signs of atypical interoception are due
to co-occurring alexithymia. A higher incidence of alex-
ithymia in numerous psychiatric and neurological disorders
(Bird & Cook, 2013; Ricciardi et al., 2015) supports the inclusion
of alexithymia measures when conducting interoception
research in any clinical group.
Clinically, these results have implications for diagnosis (in
establishing which symptoms of clinical conditions are asso-
ciated with the clinical condition per se, and which may be
caused by co-occurring alexithymia), and for intervention.

 They suggest interoceptive training may be therapeutic (e.g.,
Schaefer, Egloff, Gerlach, & Witth€
oft, 2014), but potentially
only for those patients with co-occurring alexithymia. Given
the hypothesized benefit of oxytocin for interoceptive condi-
tions (Quattrocki & Friston, 2014), it is notable that beneficial
effects of oxytocin may be limited to those with high levels of
alexithymia (Luminet, Grynberg, Ruzette, & Mikolajczak,
2011). However, it may also be the case that alexithymic in-
dividuals have such diminished interoception that intero-
ceptive training programs prove to be unsuccessful. These
possibilities are worthy of further investigation as they will
help to elucidate the circumstances in which interoceptive
training is therapeutically beneficial.
Two caveats are worthy of consideration with respect to
these results. First, there remain difficulties with the mea-
surement of interoception. Although the Heartbeat Tracking
task is widely used, in some individuals heartbeat may be
perceived via discriminative (exteroceptive) touch receptors
due to the vibration of the chest wall (Khalsa, Rudrauf,
Feinstein, & Tranel, 2009). Future research into (atypical)
interoception should therefore employ multiple measures in
order to provide convergent information on interoceptive
ability (Garfinkel et al., 2015). Second, this study was
designed specifically to elucidate the relative impact of
autism and alexithymia on interoceptive ability, while sta-
tistically controlling for other clinical traits thought to be
related to interoception (e.g., anxiety). Nevertheless, in
accordance with existing research, we observed trend-level
indications of a relationship between anxiety and IA (see
Paulus & Stein, 2010). In future research a sample comprising
sufficient variance on these traits will enable assessment of
the independent impact of, and interrelationships between,
these variables and IA.
In summary, across two experiments, results suggest that
alexithymia, not autism, is associated with atypical IA, even
after controlling for several clinical traits associated with
interoception. This advances recent research into interocep-
tive dysfunction in ASD, and suggests that the interoceptive
account of ASD may require revision. However, interpreting
atypical behavior within an interoceptive framework has po-
tential to inform the clinical management of autism and other
psychiatric conditions.
