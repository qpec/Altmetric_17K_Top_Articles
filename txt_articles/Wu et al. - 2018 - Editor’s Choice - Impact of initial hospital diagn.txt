Abstract  
Aims: Early and accurate diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction is central to successful 
treatment and improved outcomes. We aimed to investigate the impact of the initial 
hospital diagnosis on mortality for patients with acute myocardial infarction.  
Methods and results:  Cohort study using data from the Myocardial Ischaemia National 
Audit Project of patients discharged with a final diagnosis of ST-elevation myocardial 
infarction (STEMI, n=221,635) and non-STEMI (NSTEMI, n=342,777) between 1st April 2004 
and 31st March 2013 in all acute hospitals (n = 243) in England and Wales. Overall, 168,534 
(29.9%) patients had an initial diagnosis which was not the same as their final diagnosis.  
After multivariable adjustment,  for STEMI a change from an initial diagnosis of NSTEMI 
(time ratio (TR) 0.97, 95% CI 0.92�1.01) and chest pain of uncertain cause (0.98, 0.89�1.07) 
was not associated with a significant reduction in time to death, whereas for other initial 
diagnoses the time to death was significantly reduced by 21% (0.78, 0.74�0.83). For NSTEMI, 
after multivariable adjustment, a change from an initial diagnosis of STEMI was associated 
with a reduction in time to death of 10% (TR 0.90, 95% CI 0.83�0.97), but not for chest pain 
of uncertain cause (0.99, 0.96�1.02). Patients with NSTEMI who had other initial diagnoses 
had a significant 14% reduction in their time to death (TR 0.86, 95% CI 0.84�0.88). STEMI and 
NSTEMI with other initial diagnoses had low rates of pre-hospital ECG (24.3% and 21.5%), 
aspirin on hospitalisation (61.6% and 48.5%), care by a Cardiologist (60.0% and 51.5%), 
invasive coronary procedures (38.8 % and 29.2%), cardiac rehabilitation (68.9% and 62.6%) 
and guideline indicated medications at time of discharge from hospital. Had the 3.3% of 
patients with STEMI and 17.9% of NSTEMI who were admitted with other initial diagnoses 
received an initial diagnosis of STEMI and NSTEMI, then 33 and 218 deaths per year might 
have been prevented, respectively. 
 5 
 
CONCLUSION: Nearly one in three patients with acute myocardial infarction had other 
diagnoses at first medical contact, who less frequently received guideline indicated care and 
had significantly higher mortality rates. There is substantial potential, greater for NSTEMI 
than STEMI, to improve outcomes through earlier and more accurate diagnosis of acute 
myocardial infarction.

Introduction 
Acute myocardial infarction is a common cause of hospital admission and a major burden on 
healthcare resources.1,2 Its early and accurate diagnosis is central to successful treatment 
and improved outcomes.3,4 Typically, on admission to hospital an initial diagnosis is made for 
each patient which determines their treatment.  In addition to pharmacological therapies, 
this includes primary percutaneous coronary intervention or fibrinolysis for ST-elevation 
myocardial infarction (STEMI) and invasive coronary imaging and revascularisation for non-
STEMI (NSTEMI). Even though a prerequisite for the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction 
is the detection of a rise and fall in troponin,5 the preliminary hospital diagnosis is usually 
made in the absence of this information � being derived from pre-hospital data and that 
obtained from the history, clinical examination and 12-lead electrocardiograph (ECG) in an 
emergency environment.  
Our previous work found that patients with acute myocardial infarction who failed to receive 
evidence-based care at the pre-hospital phase were less likely to receive hospital treatments, 
and that this was associated with premature death.6,7 Yet, we are not aware of any studies 
which have quantified the impact of an initial hospital diagnosis which is not acute 
myocardial infarction on clinical outcomes among patients who have had an acute 
myocardial infarction. Clarifying the extent to which patients with acute myocardial 
infarction received different initial diagnoses is important given data suggesting that high 
sensitivity troponins may increase the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction and reduce 
rates of death.8,9 In this study, we sought to determine the degree to which an initial non-
specific / non-cardiac diagnosis impacted on mortality for patients hospitalised with acute 
myocardial infarction. Specifically, we aimed to describe the baseline characteristics, 
investigations performed, cardiovascular treatments received and mortality at 1 year for 
 7 
 
patients hospitalised with STEMI or NSTEMI who also had an initial diagnosis of �chest pain 
of unknown cause� or �other initial diagnosis�.   
 
Methods 
Setting and design 
We included all NHS hospitals (n=243) in England and Wales which provided care for 
patients (n=564,412) aged between 18 and 100 years at time of hospitalisation and 
discharged from hospital alive with acute myocardial infarction between 1st April 2004 and 
31st March 2013. Patient-level data were extracted from the Myocardial Ischaemia National 
Audit Project (MINAP), a comprehensive registry of hospitalisations for acute coronary 
syndrome in England and Wales, which was started in 2000 and is now mandated by the 
Department of Health.10 For multiple admissions, we used the earliest record to reduce 
potential bias form pre-existing treatments. Details of MINAP have been described 
previously.6,10 The data flow for the derivation of the analytical cohort can be seen in 
Supplement Figure 1.  
Study variables 
We included demographic factors (age, sex, year of hospital admission), past medical history 
(coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), heart 
failure, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, previous acute myocardial 
infarction and smoking status),  markers of acute myocardial infarction severity at time of 
hospitalisation (heart rate, systolic blood pressure, serum creatinine, cardiac arrest, elevated 
cardiac biomarkers and ST segment depression on the ECG),  investigations (pre-hospital ECG, 
any ECG, coronary angiography), acute treatments (aspirin, fibrinolysis, primary PCI), 
medications prescribed at hospital discharge (aspirin, P2Y12 inhibitors, angiotensin 
 8 
 
converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi)/angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARB), � blockers, HMG 
Co-A reductase inhibitors (statins) and care (cardiac rehabilitation, care by a Cardiologist). 
For each patient, we extracted information about their initial diagnosis (STEMI, NSTEMI, 
chest pain of unknown cause, other initial diagnoses). For each hospital we calculated its 
average annual volume and deprivation level (mean Townsend score) across all patients 
recorded in MINAP as attending that hospital during 2004-2013.  
Initial and final diagnoses 
The final diagnosis of STEMI and NSTEMI was based on guidelines from the European Society 
of Cardiology (ESC), American College of Cardiology (ACC) and American Heart Association 
(AHA) and determined at local level by the attending Consultant.5 The initial diagnosis was 
made by the emergency medical services or other clinicians in a position to provide 
definitive treatment. It was based on information (such as the history of the presenting 
complaint, physical examination and initial ECG) gathered in the acute setting and was not 
modified on the basis of further ECGs or cardiac biomarkers. The initial diagnoses included 
STEMI, NSTEMI, chest pain of uncertain origin and other initial diagnoses. Chest pain of 
unknown origin was defined as a single episode of chest pain thought to be cardiac in nature 
where hospital admission was felt appropriate to exclude an ischaemic event. It covered 
admissions where no clear initial diagnosis was made, but where there was suspicion that a 
��������� symptoms were ischaemic in nature. Other initial diagnoses included non-cardiac 
diagnoses (such as pancreatitis) as well as non-acute myocardial infarction diagnoses (such 
as acute aortic dissection).  
We created a variable ������ �change in diagnosis� �� represent combinations of initial to final 
diagnoses, made at hospital admission and discharge, respectively. The change in diagnosis 
categories included; “TEMI�“TEMI� N“TEMI�“TEMI� ����� ���� of ������� ������“TEMI�

������� ������N“TEMI� other initial diagnose��N“TEMI�  
Mortality  
The primary clinical outcome was mortality from all causes at 1 year after discharge from 
hospital. National unique identifiers were used to link patients with the Office for National 
Statistics, and we accessed the registry to ascertain vital status or date of death at 1-year. 
The survival duration was derived from the date of death or censorship and date of 
discharge from hospital.  
Statistical analysis 
Baseline characteristics, investigations and treatments were stratified by initial and final 
diagnosis and described using median (interquartile range, IQR) for numerical variables and 
count (%) for categorical variables. Odds ratios (OR) or median difference (MD) were 
calculated for patient variables between stratified groups and the Chi-squared test or 
Wilcoxon rank-sum tests used to test the significance of the differences between strata. We 
categorised all numerical variables. We used a survival tree model to determine age cut-offs 
(���, 62-73, 74-��� ��� �83 years) to maximise mortality differences between age groups 
and to mitigate non-linear effects; whereas serum creatinine, heart rate, systolic blood 
pressure and length of hospital stay were split by tertiles.  
We compared mortality rates at 1 year by age and sex, stratified by the change in diagnosis 
categories. We used Kaplan�Meier survival curves to depict unadjusted survival estimates to 
1 year by change in diagnosis category. We investigated the association between the change 
in diagnosis and time to death at 1 year using accelerated failure time models (Cox models 
violated the proportional hazards assumption). Separate models for final diagnosis STEMI 
and NSTEMI included change in diagnosis as the explanatory variable adjusted for patient 
 10 
 
baseline clinical and treatment characteristics; including age, sex, CABG, heart failure, 
diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, previous myocardial infarction, percutaneous 
coronary intervention, prior or current smoking, creatinine, heart rate and systolic blood 
pressure on admission, cardiac arrest, elevation of cardiac enzymes, ST segment depression 
on the ECG, emergency reperfusion therapy (fibrinolysis or primary percutaneous coronary 
intervention), acute or chronic aspirin, pre-hospital or any ECG, care by a cardiologist, 
coronary angiography, cardiac rehabilitation and at discharge from hospital the prescription 
of aspirin, P2Y12 inhibitors� � �������� ������ ��� ACE��A‘B. We also adjusted for length of 
hospital stay, hospital volume, Townsend score per hospital and year of hospital admission. 
A random intercept representing each hospital was added to the model to account for the 
clustering of patients within hospitals.  
We used linear mixed effects logistic regression models, separately for patients with a final 
diagnosis of STEMI and NSTEMI, to investigate which factors were associated with a change 
in diagnosis. Therefore, to predict a change ���� “TEMI�“TEMI ��� ������� �������� ���� 
other initial diagnose��“TEMI ��������� �� built models that included the same patient 
clinical variables as we had used for the survival models but excluded treatment variables.  
We included a random intercept representing the participating hospitals. Model selection 
was performed to eliminate the covariates that were not significant. We applied the same 
model to predict changes for the NSTEMI combinations of diagnoses.   
We estimated the total number of deaths that might have been prevented if the initial 
diagnosis was correct by multiplying the adjusted time ratio of a change in diagnosis by the 1 
year mortality rate for STEMI and NSTEMI respectively. This was then multiplied by the 
proportion of patients who received an incorrect diagnosis out of the total number of cases 
between 2004 and 2013.

The accelerated time failure and logistic regression models were applied to complete cases 
and estimates presented with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Where not specified, a P-value 
<0.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance. Statistical analyses were performed 
with R (version 3.2.2).  
Sensitivity analysis 
To assess the impact of incomplete data on the results of the modelling (under the 
assumption that data were not missing at random), for each variable we created an extra

category, w� �������� ��� ��������� ����� ������ �� ��� ��������� ����� �� �� ��� ������� 
level group for each variable, and repeated our main analysis to the newly formed variables. 
This gave us the possible range of coefficients (eTable 5-6).  
 
Results 
Of 564,412 patients with acute myocardial infarction (mean age 68.4 (SD 13.7) years, 66.8% 
male), the majority (86.4%) were white, one fifth (19.1%) had diabetes and one fifth (21.5%) 
previous myocardial infarction (Table 1). Nearly two thirds (64.1%) were prior or current 
smokers, 48.8% had hypertension, 33.3% hyperlipidaemia.  For the cohort, 3.8% had a 
cardiac arrest, and 16.3% had ST depression on their ECG. The median (IQR) hospital stay 
was 5 (3-9) days. Table 1 shows that patients with a final diagnosis of NSTEMI were more 
frequently co-morbid, and had longer hospital stays. In total, 168,534 (29.9%) patients had 
an initial diagnosis which was not the same as their final diagnosis.  For final diagnosis STEMI 
and NSTEMI, the proportions with other initial diagnoses (3.3% and 17.9%) was higher than 
 12 
 
the proportions with chest pain of uncertain cause (2.9% and 16.1%), but lower than the 
proportion with initial diagnosis NSTEMI (14.2%) and STEMI (19.7%).  
 
Baseline characteristics 
eTables 1 and 2 show the baseline characteristics of patients with STEMI and NSTEMI 
according to their initial diagnoses. For STEMI, patients who had an initial diagnosis of 
NSTEMI, chest pain of uncertain cause or another initial diagnosis were older, more 
frequently female with heart failure, diabetes, previous myocardial infarction, higher 
creatinine and heart rates, cardiac arrest, ST depression on their ECG and longer lengths of 
hospital stay. These findings were more pronounced among patients with other initial 
diagnoses whose length of hospital stays was more than twice that of patients who had an 
initial diagnosis of STEMI (9 vs. 4 days). For NSTEMI, the findings were very similar; those 
who did not have an initial diagnosis of NSTEMI were more frequently older, female and co-
morbid. Lengths of hospital stays for those with other initial diagnoses were nearly double 
that of NSTEMI (11 vs. 6 days).  
For patients with other initial diagnoses, the strongest predictors for change to a final 
diagnosis of STEMI were, ST segment depression (OR 2.97, 95% CI 2.26-3.89), ��� �83 years 
(2.81, 2.42-3.25), heart rate >86 bpm (2.12, 1.90-2.37) and heart failure (1.96, 1.58-2.44) 
(Figure 1). The use of a pre-hospital ECG was associated with an 85% chance of not changing 
diagnosis to STEMI (OR 0.15, 95% CI 0.14-0.17). Having a length of hospital stay over 7 days 
increased the likelihood of being diagnosed with STEMI by 4-fold (4.34, 3.83-4.91). For 
NSTEMI who presented with other initial diagnoses, the strongest predictors for change of 
their diagnosis ����� ��� ��� ����� �O‘ ����� ��� CI 2.98-3.35), cardiac arrest (2.77, 2.48-
3.09), heart rate >86 bpm (2.38, 2.28-2.48) and heart failure (1.55, 1.47-1.64). The use of a 
 13 
 
pre-hospital ECG was the strongest predictor for not changing to a diagnosis of NSTEMI (OR 
0.36, 95% CI 0.35-0.37) and having a length of hospital stay over 7 days increased the 
likelihood of being diagnosed with NSTEMI by 4-fold (4.05, CI 3.84-4.27).  The adjusted risk 
of a change in diagnosis from other initial diagnoses to that of final STEMI or NSTEMI 
diagnosis varied significantly by hospital (eFigure 2).  
Treatments 
eTables 3 and 4 show the treatments for STEMI and NSTEMI according to their initial 
diagnoses. For STEMI, patients who had an initial diagnosis of NSTEMI, chest pain of 
uncertain cause or other initial diagnoses less frequently received reperfusion therapy, 
aspirin on hospital admission or a pre-hospital ECG. They less frequently were under the care 
of a Cardiologist, received coronary angiography, cardiac rehabilitation and any guideline 
indicated medication at the time of discharge from hospital.  For NSTEMI, a similar pattern 
of care was evident, with particularly low rates of coronary angiography among those with 
other initial diagnoses.  
Mortality 
At 1 year following hospital discharge, the mortality rate among STEMI who had an initial 
diagnosis of STEMI was 5.6% compared with a higher rate for those with an initial diagnosis 
of NSTEMI (8.4%), chest pain of uncertain cause (8.3%) and other initial diagnoses (21.3%) 
(Figure 2).  For NSTEMI, the contrast in mortality at 1 year between patients with an initial 
diagnosis of NSTEMI (10.7%) and those with STEMI (11.4%) and chest pain of uncertain 
cause (11.5%) was less evident. Patients with NSTEMI who had other initial diagnoses, 
however, had mortality rates at 1 year more than double (25.5%) that of patients with an 
initial diagnosis of NSTEMI.  With increasing age, but not by sex, these differences were 
accentuated (Figure 3).  
 14 
 
After adjustment for case mix, investigations and treatments (Table 2), for STEMI a change 
from an initial diagnosis of NSTEMI (time ratio (TR) 0.97, 95% CI 0.92�1.01) and chest pain of 
uncertain cause (0.98, 0.89�1.07) was not associated with a significant reduction in time to 
death, whereas for other initial diagnoses the time to death was significantly reduced by 21% 
(0.78, 0.74�0.83). For NSTEMI, after multivariable adjustment (Table 3), a change from an 
initial diagnosis of STEMI was associated with a reduction in time to death of 10% (TR 0.90, 
95% CI 0.83�0.97), but not for chest pain of uncertain cause (0.99, 0.96�1.02). Patients with 
NSTEMI who had other initial diagnoses had a significant 14% reduction in their time to 
death (TR 0.86, 95% CI 0.84�0.88).  
Further, if the 7,411 patients with STEMI who were admitted with other initial diagnoses had 
received an initial diagnosis of STEMI then 332 deaths (33 deaths per year) at 1 year might 
have been prevented. Equally, if the 61,204 patients with NSTEMI who were admitted with 
other initial diagnoses had received an initial diagnosis of NSTEMI then 2,185 deaths (218 
deaths per year) at 1 year might have been prevented. 
Sensitivity analysis 
Sensitivity analysis was performed for each model using all available cases as described in 
methods section. The results are presented in eTable 5-6 for logistic regression models for 
predicting the change of diagnosis, and Table 2-3 for accelerated time failure models for 
predicting the 1-year survival. The results show a narrow range of the coefficients containing 
the coefficient values from the corresponding models using complete cases.  
 
Discussion 
Acute myocardial infarction is a common reason for hospitalisation and a medical 
emergency that requires early access to specialist treatment.11,12 Evidence from clinical and 
 15 
 
basic science studies reveals that delays to guideline-indicated care (such as timely 
reperfusion for STEMI and risk-stratified revascularisation for NSTEMI) are associated with 
increased mortality.3,4,13  The diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction, however, is not 
always apparent at first medical contact. Our study of over 500,000 patients with a diagnosis 
of STEMI or NSTEMI shows that a preliminary diagnosis made at initial medical contact which 
was not of acute myocardial infarction was not infrequent. Among the one in three cases 
where there was inconsistency between the initial and final diagnosis, the chance of 
receiving guideline indicated treatments for the management of acute myocardial infarction 
was significantly reduced and associated high rates of premature death. We estimated that, 
over the decade of study, had patients with acute myocardial infarction who were admitted 
with other initial diagnoses received an initial diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction, then 
over 250 deaths per year might have been prevented, respectively.  
Whilst a preliminary diagnosis of STEMI is readily made among patients with chest pain who 
have ST-segment elevation or new left bundle branch block on their presenting ECG, its 
timely diagnosis relies on the early use of the ECG. In the UK, as with other modern 
healthcare systems, the emergency management of STEMI has become institutionally 
operationalised � patients bypass local hospital to receive primary PCI at Heart Attack 
Centres � and this has been associated with the decline in the rates of death following 
STEMI.14-16 Even so, our study shows that a proportion of patients (who, typically, were more 
co-morbid) did not receive an early diagnosis of STEMI. In turn, this was associated with 
premature death because they were much less likely to receive evidence-based care. Our 
earlier work revealed sub-optimal use of the pre-hospital ECG, which is a critical step in the 
�perfect patient pathway� for the management of STEMI.7 Moreover, early missed care 
opportunities such as the provision of a pre-hospital ECG are associated with the failure to 
provide guideline-indicated care later on, which in turn is associated with significantly higher 
 16 
 
rates of death compared with patients who receive interventions early in the STEMI 
pathway.6   
Survival was reduced by up to a fifth among patients with acute myocardial infarction who 
had other initial diagnoses at first medical contact. These findings were upheld after 
adjusting for case mix, cardiovascular risk and treatments received, suggesting that either 
other factors are responsible for the reduced survival or our adjustment was not 
comprehensive. Other factors may include delays to rather than the receipt of treatments or 
the availability of specialist hospital facilities and staffing16.  By comparison we found, after 
adjustment, no survival disadvantage for NSTEMI who initially were diagnosed as STEMI, and 
STEMI who were initially diagnosed with NSTEMI. This may have been because, although the 
risk of receiving guideline-indicated care was lower for patients who changed between 
STEMI and NSTEMI diagnoses, treatment use among these groups was comparably high and 
our models captured the multimorbidity of patients with NSTEMI. Similarly, we did not find a 
survival disadvantage following adjustment for case mix, risk and treatments received for 
patients who had an initial diagnosis of chest pain of uncertain cause. Again, whilst these 
patients were less likely to receive care interventions, overall they had high rates of use of 
guideline-indicated treatments for acute myocardial infarction. Moreover, it was among 
patients who had initial other diagnoses that treatments were less frequent compared with 
patients with chest pain of uncertain cause and those who did not have a change of 
diagnosis.  
We found that the proportion of patients with NSTEMI who did not have an initial diagnosis 
of NSTEMI was at least five-fold higher than for patients with STEMI. Such patients, whilst 
being more co-morbid, were less likely to receive guideline-indicated care and more likely to 
die sooner than patients who had an initial diagnosis of NSTEMI. Even though it is not 
unusual for patients with NSTEMI to have a normal ECG, we found that a quarter of those 
 17 
 
with other initial diagnoses had electrocardiographic ST-segment depression, which was of 
similar frequency to that for patients who had an initial diagnosis of NSTEMI. In contrast to 
STEMI, the diagnosis of NSTEMI is more dependent upon the results of the troponin assay, 
which is rarely available at first medical contact. Therefore, approaches to reduce potential 
harm through omission of care would include the early use of high-sensitivity troponin which 
is associated with higher and earlier rates of diagnosis of NSTEMI, more frequent use of 
guideline-indicated care and better clinical outcomes.9 By increasing diagnostic certainty, 
emergency department congestion would be reduced and there would be fewer 
unnecessary non-cardiac hospitalisations.17,18  
Our investigation has a number of other important clinical implications. In the absence of 
early troponin results, physicians are reliant on the clinical history and results of the ECG.  
Yet, over half of patients will have a non-diagnostic ECG and atypical symptoms of acute 
myocardial infarction are not uncommon in the elderly, women and in patients with 
diabetes, chronic renal failure or dementia.19-21 Furthermore, the history of chest pain has 
been shown to be of limited value in cases of suspected acute coronary syndrome.22,23 For 
NSTEMI, where the diagnostic yield from the ECG is, by definition, lower than for STEMI, 
physicians are even more reliant on the typicality of the history of chest pain. Our 
observational evidence of potentially avoidable deaths associated with delayed STEMI and 
NSTEMI diagnoses serves to remind clinicians of the importance of being aware of the range 
of characteristics with which patients with acute myocardial infarction present to hospital. 
Specifically for NSTEMI, our results in light of other recent cohort data call for the earlier use 
and wider adoption of high sensitivity troponins as well as a focus on the systematic 
application of accelerated diagnostic protocols using risk scores rather than subjective 
clinical assessment.9,24-26

There are some limitations to this study. We did not have data regarding the type and timing 
of the troponin assay and therefore, we could not determine their effect on the change in 
diagnosis. Nonetheless, there is good evidence for the impact of troponins on diagnostic 
yield.8,9,24   We were reliant on the accurate recording of the diagnoses and we did not have 
data for the specific clinical diagnosis under the category other initial diagnoses. Even 
though MINAP performs annual data validation,10 this could have led to misclassification bias 
and precluded higher resolution interrogation of specific preliminary diagnoses (such as the 
frequency of pancreatitis as an initial diagnosis). Nonetheless, we were careful in our 
selection of patients with a final diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction (eFigure 1), and one 
of the strengths of the cohort was the ability to determine STEMI and NSTEMI among a very 
large cohort of patients. Also, we excluded patients who died in hospital because we were 
unsure as to what treatments they had received. In doing so, we may have underestimated 
the effects of a change in diagnosis because the risk of dying from acute myocardial 
infarction is higher early after the event27. Finally, MINAP does not record data for all 
patients with acute myocardial infarction.1 Given this, our calculation of the numbers of 
preventable deaths is underestimated and the potential for improvement is likely to be 
much greater.
