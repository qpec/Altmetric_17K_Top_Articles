BACKGROUND: Statin therapy is recommended for reducing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease
(ASCVD) risk. Significant risk can remain because of insufficient clinical response or statin intoler-
ance. Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type-9 (PCSK9) therapy lowers low-density lipoprotein
cholesterol and has recently been shown to lower ASCVD events.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to assess the barriers and challenges experienced with the
access and approval reimbursement process for PCSK9 inhibitor prescriptions.
METHODS: In 2016, the National Lipid Association conducted an online survey on PCSK9 inhibitor
use and barriers to prescription among experienced healthcare workers who provide care to high-risk
patients with ASCVD or familial hypercholesterolemia (FH).
RESULTS: There were 434 respondent healthcare workers with extensive experience in treating
lipid disorders. PCSK9 inhibitors are considered by 71.3% of respondent providers with statin-
intolerant patients. There were high rates (.85%) of initial denial. The major barriers to approvals
were insurer processes, provider documentation (inadequate documentation of maximally tolerated
statin dose, diagnostic criteria for FH, number of statins failed if statin intolerant and most recent
low-density lipoprotein cholesterol), and administrative burden (time, staff, paperwork, and appeals).
Provider approval rates for getting $75% patients approved were higher for FH (43%) than for
ASCVD patients (36%). Among providers with good approval rates, documentation was the most crit-
ical factor. Barriers more difficult to overcome include perceived higher threshold requirements by
payers, drugs not on formulary, and drug costs.

Introduction
Statins have been approved in the United States since
1987 and are widely used in both secondary and primary
prevention
of
atherosclerotic
cardiovascular
disease
(ASCVD) because of their proven benefits.1 However,
statin therapy has some important limitations. First, even
with high-intensity statin treatment, some patients can fail
to
attain
desired
low-density
lipoprotein
cholesterol
(LDL-C) reductions, and therefore remain at high risk of
a cardiovascular (CV) event.2 Patients with untreated famil-
ial hypercholesterolemia (FH) have markedly elevated
LDL-C levels,3 and in this group, a large proportion fail
to attain LDL-C goals despite therapy with maximally
tolerated statins plus ezetimibe.4 Second, some patients
do not tolerate statins and are considered ‘‘statin intol-
erant,’’ with statin-associated muscle symptoms being the
most common.5 The incidence of statin intolerance (SI)
has been difficult to estimate because of varying clinical
trial designs, lack of ability to easily identify SI in postmar-
ket assessment, and differing agents being used.5 An
Internet survey conducted by the National Lipid Associa-
tion (NLA) of 10,138 current and former statin users (Un-
derstanding Statin Use in America and Gaps in Patient
Education) found that 60% of former and 25% of current
statin users reported muscle symptoms while taking a
statin.6
Therefore, it is clear that statins may not be sufficient for
LDL-C control in some patients, and other options are
needed to ensure that more high-risk patients (ASCVD/FH)
with elevated LDL-C are able to achieve treatment goals.
Relatively, recent research in the field of clinical
lipidology has led to the development of inhibitors of
proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9).7
PCSK9 is a key regulator of hepatic LDL receptor (LDL-
R) activity. PCSK9 binds to the LDL-R expressed on the
cell surface of hepatocytes, where it prevents recycling of
the LDL-R and therefore promotes its degradation.8 The
result of PSCK9 inhibition is to enable more hepatic
LDL-R to bind and sequester LDL-C, and thereby reduce
circulating LDL-C levels, as well as levels of other poten-
tially atherogenic lipoproteins such as very low–density li-
poproteins and lipoprotein(a).8
At present, 2 injectable fully human monoclonal anti-
body PCSK9 inhibitors have been approved by the Food
and Drug Administration—alirocumab (Praluent; Sanofi/
Regeneron Pharmaceuticals)9 and evolocumab (Repatha;
Amgen).10 Both of these agents are indicated as an adjunct
to diet and maximally tolerated statin therapy for treatment
of adults with heterozygous FH or clinical ASCVD, who
require additional lowering of LDL-C.9,10 Recently, results
from the Further cardiovascular OUtcomes Research with
PCSK9
Inhibition
in
subjects
with
Elevated
Risk
(FOURIER) trial demonstrated that addition of evolocumab
to statin therapy significantly reduced CV event rates by
15% to 20% in patients with ASCVD.11
Given that PCSK9 inhibitors are relatively costly mono-
clonal antibodies, access to the approval for the use of these
drugs is often limited, which can impede optimal CV risk
management. Therefore, it is important to understand what
the barriers to PCSK9 inhibitor prescription approval are
such that healthcare systems and processes can be struc-
tured to deliver appropriately targeted, high-quality care to
patients who will benefit from additional lipid-lowering
therapy with these agents.
The NLA routinely publishes recommendations and
statements for healthcare professionals, payers, and policy
makers with the aim of optimizing the treatment of patients
with dyslipidemias. For PCSK9 inhibitors, an online survey
of NLA members, and other invited participants with
experience in treating patients with lipid disorders, was
conducted to gather information on prescribing patterns and
barriers in PCSK9 inhibitor use. The major findings of this
survey are reported here.
Methods
An online survey, developed by the NLA and adminis-
tered by Professional Research Consultants Inc (Omaha,
NE, USA), was conducted between August 26, 2016 and
October 14, 2016 (open for 6 weeks). Invitees were NLA
members and selected external healthcare professionals
with interest and experience in caring for patients with
dyslipidemias. Reminders to complete were sent over the 6-
week period of the survey and at the American Society of
Preventive Cardiology Annual Meeting, September 2016.
The survey was also advertised by the NLA via e-mail, web
advertisements on the NLA and media partners’ Web sites,
postcards to NLA members, social media, and responder
referrals.
The survey included 170 questions designed to query the
demographic and job function of the respondents, the
general profile of the patients under their care (with
particular reference to those at high risk of ASCVD), statin
use, and treatment decisions regarding PCSK9 inhibitors.
Questions were provided by an experienced group of lipid
experts. The NLA was solely responsible for the creation of
892
Journal of Clinical Lipidology, Vol 11, No 4, August 2017
 the questions and content of the survey. The questions were
constructed as multiple-choice options along with free-text
fields for completion. Most questions were multiple choice
with no more than 5 answer options. Open questions with
‘‘other’’ options and free-text responses were categorized
and coded according to recommendations from NLA
experts using normal clinical vocabulary.
The survey was designed to take approximately 20 mi-
nutes to complete, and no payment was provided to
respondents. The survey was conducted using a standard
web interface operable via web browser software. Data
were collected by Professional Research Consultants Inc
and processed according to an analysis plan that was
adapted by the NLA according to responses to key
questions. Data are presented in a descriptive format.
No institutional review board approval was required for
this survey.
Results
Participants
The survey included 434 respondents. Of these 264
(61%) were physicians. More than three-quarters of the
self-identified lipid specialists stated that they were certi-
fied by either the American Board of Clinical Lipidology or
the Accreditation Council for Clinical Lipidology. More
than two-thirds (69.7%) stated that they had access to staff
to assist them with the drug approval process (Table 1).
Eighty-five percent of respondents were responsible for
writing prescriptions.
Statin use and provider practice patterns
Most respondents (84.3%) stated that, in line with
recommendations from the NLA,12 they prescribe lipid-
lowering medication to achieve a specific LDL-C target,
and the remainder (15.7%) treated to a specific high-dose
statin. To achieve these targets, 34.6% of respondents had
more than 75% of their high-risk patients on high-
intensity statin therapy (20–40 mg rosuvastatin or 40–
80 mg atorvastatin). Twenty-seven percent had between
51% and 75% of high-risk patients on high doses, 22.4%
had between 26% and 50% of their high-risk patients on
high doses, and 15% had fewer than one-quarter of their
high-risk patients on high-intensity stain therapy. These
data indicate that although most physicians (61.9%) are
striving to maintain high-intensity statin therapy, there re-
mains a substantial proportion of patients at high ASCVD
risk who are unable to tolerate high-intensity statin therapy.
The reasons given for not using high-intensity statin ther-
apy in certain high-risk patients were varied (Fig. 1).
Among 419 respondents answering the question, 413
(98.5%) stated that high-intensity statin therapy was not
used because of side effects or intolerance (294 [70%
gave this as their first answer]). Lack of adherence

 (n 5 271, 64%) and patients preferring other treatments
(n 5 229 55%) were the other common reasons cited
(Fig. 1).
In the survey, 60.9% of respondents said that up to one-
quarter of their high-risk patients have an intolerance to
statins that prevents their patients from reaching their
LDL-C goals. Among the adverse events experienced,
almost all the respondents (96.6%) stated that muscle
pain and/or weakness was the most common complaint.
Similarly, 70.5% of respondents estimated that up to 25%
of their patients do not adhere to statin prescriptions or
prefer not to use the drugs. In most cases (83.3% of

 respondents), these patients first received counseling to
explain, for example, the importance of taking their
medication and the risks associated with failure to lower
LDL-C levels. PCSK9 inhibitors were chiefly tried as a
fourth option after counseling, statin change, and adjunctive
therapy in patients who do not adhere or prefer not to take
statins (56.4% of respondents).
Attempts to maintain statin therapy in these patients was
evidenced by the fact that more than 75% of respondents
routinely try 3 or more statin medications before consid-
ering a high-risk patient to be statin intolerant.
Use of adjunctive nonstatin therapies
For high-risk patients who are unable to achieve their
LDL-C target on a maximally tolerated statin dose, most
respondents (85.4%) would then add nonstatin adjunctive
therapy, with ezetimibe as the leading initial choice. After
that, 71.3% would try a PCSK9 inhibitor as second choice.
More than one-quarter of respondents (27.3%) would take
no further action on statin failure (Fig. 2A). For those pa-
tients in whom statin-associated side effects were prevent-
ing them from reaching LDL-C goals, most respondents
(63.0%) would first stop the statin to see if the patient’s
symptoms disappear. If the symptoms disappeared, the
next course of action was for providers to change either
the statin or the statin dose, before trying a PCSK9 inhibitor
(71.4% opted for a PCSK9 inhibitor as their third line of ac-
tion; Fig. 2B).
Provider variability in PCSK9 inhibitor
prescribing rates
Most of the respondents have attempted to get approval
for a PCSK9 inhibitor. However, 1 in 6 (16.9%) have never
attempted to prescribe a PCSK9 inhibitor for any of their
patients with ASCVD, and 1 in 7 (14.8%) have never
attempted to prescribe for their patients with FH. Among
those who have prescribed a PCSK9 inhibitor for their
patients with ASCVD, most (57.6%) have prescribed
,10% of their ASCVD patients. Attempts to prescribe a
PCSK9 inhibitor for a patient with FH was greater than for
a patient with ASCVD; however, 37.5% of respondents
have attempted to prescribe a PCSK9 inhibitor in more than
half of their FH patients.
It was observed that most respondents reported that
many of their high-risk patients are not able to reach their
LDL-C goals and that 71.4% would prescribe a PCSK9
inhibitor in their high-risk patients who are on a maximally
tolerated statin regimen and not at their clinical goals.
However, fewer have actually attempted to seek approval
for a PCSK9 inhibitor.
Among the small number of respondents who had never
attempted to prescribe a PCSK9 inhibitor, the chief reasons
given for not prescribing the drugs for FH were the patient
being at goal and the cost of the drugs (10 of 46 available
responses [21.7%] for each reason). For ASCVD, 18 of 59
respondents (30.5%) stated that cost to the patient was the
chief barrier preventing them from seeking permission for a
PCSK9 inhibitor. Seven respondents suggested that exces-
sive paperwork was the leading reason for not seeking a
PCSK9 inhibitor for ASCVD.
Differences in perceived LDL thresholds
between providers and payers
Another important barrier is that payers may have higher
LDL-C thresholds for approval than is the case for
providers. Figure 3 shows commonly applied threshold
LDL-C values at which physicians will prescribe a

 PCSK9 inhibitor vs the level at which physicians have
experienced payers approving. The graph shows the per-
centage of respondents who cited each of the given LDL-
C ranges as their most frequently encountered threshold.
For both FH and ASCVD patients, the respondents indi-
cated that they use lower thresholds for initiating PCSK9
inhibitor requests than payers.
PCSK9 inhibitor denial rates and reasons for
denial
For those who attempted to obtain approval to prescribe a
PCSK9 inhibitor, denial rates of more than 75% were
reported by 33.5% of respondents attempting to treat
ASCVD patients and 25.2% of patients attempting to treat
an FH patient. Despite multiple appeals, 64% and 57% of
respondents with ASCVD and FH patients, respectively,
were unable to get three-quarters of their prescriptions
approved (Fig. 4). The reasons given for denial were mainly
because of documentation issues. For FH, 148 of 267 respon-
dents (55.4%) stated that inadequate documentation of FH
was among the most common reasons for denial of a
PCSK9 inhibitor (Fig. 5B). Additional medical documenta-
tion and a lack of current laboratory values combined were
cited by 154 respondents (57.6%) as reasons for denial. For
ASCVD, 72% (228/316) of providers reported that it was
not on the insurance formulary (as their top first, second,
and third choice). Documentation-related problems were
evident in 311 responses (98.4%; Fig. 5A). Lack of documen-
tation as to why the patient is not on a high-intensity statin, or
why a patient is on a maximally tolerated statin dose, was the
third most common reason for a denial in ASCVD patients
and second most common reason for FH patients.
Types of assistance that providers request to
improve PCSK9 inhibitor approval rates
Figure 6 shows what type of assistance respondents
would like to receive to enable successful PCSK9 inhibitor
applications. The most common request was for improve-
ments to the overall application and reimbursement process
(21% of respondents), and documentation appears again as
an important factor (12.6% of respondents cited ‘‘documen-
tation,’’ and a further 8.6% said ‘‘paperwork’’).
The survey found that practice staff is completing
documentation for 52.0% of applications, and physicians
for only 28.9%. Almost one-quarter of respondents (24.1%)
said that they took more than 2 h/wk to complete. Just over
one-quarter of respondents (27.8%) said that the applica-
tions took 30 to 59 minutes; 26.6% said 1 to 2 hours. For
21.5% of these staff, PCSK9 inhibitor prescription appli-
cations consumed ,30 min/wk. Importantly, among those
taking more than 2 hours to complete the documentation,
10.3% of respondents were physicians, and 30.8% were
other practice staff. For those taking #30 minutes, 35.9%
were physicians, and 14.5% were practice staff.
Respondents were asked to identify the important keys
to successful navigation of the PCSK9 inhibitor approval
process. The results are shown in Figure 7 and highlight
that accurate and current documentations are critical.

 Discussion
The survey was completed by healthcare providers,
mainly physicians and others who are experienced in
treating patients with lipid disorders. The principal findings
are that those treating ASCVD and FH patients are using
statins and nonstatin therapies consistent with recommen-
dations from the NLA12,13 and in accordance with the prin-
ciples of the recent consensus update on nonstatin therapies
from the American College of Cardiology/American Heart
Association (ACC/AHA).14 The findings from our study
also confirm results from other studies that in real-world
practice, many high-risk patients are not able to tolerate
high-intensity statins and fail to achieve their LDL-C
goals.15,16 For these patients, our survey results demon-
strate that there is a desire to use PCSK9 inhibitors after
adjuvant therapy has been added. Data suggest that respon-
dents consider prescribing a PCSK9 inhibitor, but there is
reluctance in actually prescribing one, possibly because
of perceived unattainable thresholds applied by payers.

897
 The data clearly show that there are barriers to PSCK9 in-
hibitor prescription approval, but these can often be sur-
mounted with adequate documentation and persistence.
A strength of this survey is the number of respondents
and their varied roles. The intent was to include experi-
enced healthcare providers who are involved in the process
of gaining approval for use of PCSK9 inhibitors, and many
of them were not necessarily physicians. The survey
included 434 respondents, and by design, most were
members of the NLA. Among the sample, most respon-
dents were lipid specialists or cardiologists, many of whom
were certified as such. These are the types of individuals
that are needed to generate high-quality and actionable data
on practice patterns of statin and PCSK9 inhibitor use.
Approximately 80% of respondents said that they treated
to an LDL-C goal rather than a given dose of statins. This is
in line with the current NLA recommendations,14 which
suggest that LDL-C levels should be lowered to specific
goals, depending on ASCVD risk level (,70 mg/dL for
very high risk or ,100 mg/dL for others), and by at least
50% in those unable to reach these levels.14 The survey
did not collect data on goal attainment, but expectations
have been that the introduction of the updated recommen-
dations from both the NLA and ACC/AHA will have a pos-
itive
impact
on
achieving
LDL-C
goals
in
clinical
practice.17 The large proportion of respondents stating
that they treat to LDL-C goals may reflect the fact that
the large proportion of respondents were members of the
NLA, which has published recommendations on LDL-C
(and non-HDL-C) goals.12,13
Further encouraging are the data gathered on physician
persistence with statins. When faced with a patient who
fails to achieve LDL-C targets on their maximally tolerated
statin dose, the vast majority of respondents stated that they
would add adjunctive therapy, which would presumably be
ezetimibe in most instances. It was only at the next decision
point where physicians would consider PCSK9 inhibitors.
This progression through statins, adjunctive therapies, and
PCSK9 inhibitors is entirely commensurate with the need
to keep patients on high-dose statins for as long as possible
and use other therapies after statin options have been
exhausted. This practice is in line with NLA recommenda-
tions and the recently published ACC consensus state-
ment.12–14
For patients who have tolerability issues with statins, the
same treatment approach was evident in the survey, with
the exception of adding the initial step of stopping the statin
to determine adverse event causality. Cessation of statin
therapy while adverse events are reassessed is good clinical
practice. In both situations (patients failing to reach LDL-C
targets on high-intensity statin therapy, and patients who do
not tolerate statins), most of the respondents would do
something positive about the situation—first adding an
adjunctive therapy and then trying to add a PCSK9
inhibitor. Overall, the picture of the survey respondents is
a group of well-informed healthcare professionals who
follow ACC/AHA and/or NLA recommendations and have
a proactive attitude toward achieving the best outcomes
possible for their patients.
The main reason given for high-risk patients not
receiving high-intensity statin therapy was adverse events,
chiefly myalgia. The survey data highlighted some issues of
patient preference to avoid statins as well as patient
noncompliance with prescribed statins, but these responses
may also have their genesis in actual (or fear of) statin-
induced myalgia and other side effects. The NLA has
recently published advice for clinicians who need to
counsel patients on SI and has made research suggestions
for trials that would enable full characterization of the
condition.5
A key issue with PCSK9 inhibitor use comes when
healthcare teams apply for approval. The survey has

898
Journal of Clinical Lipidology, Vol 11, No 4, August 2017
 identified 2 types of modifiable barriers beyond the drug
not being on formulary. The first of these lies with payers
who may apply LDL-C thresholds to enable PCSK9
inhibitor use that are higher than the thresholds preferred
by many healthcare teams. Therefore, some clinicians who
may wish to use a PCSK9 inhibitor in a high-risk patient
may be denied access because the LDL-C value in the
patient may be lower than the threshold for approval set by
the payer. This barrier can only be addressed with
additional evidence demonstrating to payers that lower
LDL thresholds are clinically indicated and lead to
improved outcomes. The same solution applies to those
situations where the formularies do not include PCSK9
inhibitors. Additional data, on PCSK9 inhibitors, such as
those from the recent FOURIER trial,11 are likely to alter
the position taken by payers.
The second principal barrier was found to be documen-
tation. In almost all instances, respondents cited reasons for
PCSK9 inhibitor denial as being associated with deficient
documentation of one kind or another. In many cases, once
adequate documentation is provided, the reapplication
eventually results in approval. The need for adequate
documentation is a straightforward problem and should
be relatively easy to overcome. A checklist of all the
required documents to support an approval, including
medical history, clinical and genetic confirmation (in the
case of FH), history of statin use, current statin dose and, if
the patient is not on a high intensity statin, the reason why,
and a full set of laboratory values, including LDL-C,
,30 days before the application is recommended. In our
survey, in just over one-half of respondents, the documen-
tation needed to prescribe a PCSK9 inhibitor was compiled
by the physician’s office staff. Therefore, it is important
that the responsible staff also be trained in compiling this
documentation.
The survey data include some reasons for optimism.
Approximately, 96% of respondents took some further
action after a denial and persisted in their attempts for
seeking approval. After initial refusal, many respondents
were eventually successful in obtaining approval for a
PCSK9 inhibitor. In Table 2, see a proposed checklist to
assist healthcare teams that are seeking approval to pre-
scribe a PCSK9 inhibitor.
The survey conducted has some limitations inherent in
its design and broad scope. In a survey of this type, it is not
possible to cover every eventuality. There is a possibility
that the multiple-choice response options did not include
some lesser-known modes of therapy or motivations to
prescribe. This was minimized by categorizing individual
free-text responses. For LDL-C thresholds applied by
payers, individual assessment of LDL-C values by respon-
dent was not done. In addition, at the time of the survey,
data on the safety and efficacy of PCSK9 inhibitors, were
building rapidly; however, outcome results were not yet
available. Therefore, for some payers, it may not have been
a matter of LDL-C thresholds, but a lack of outcome data
resulted in prescription denial. This situation may change
with the recent publication of the FOURIER trial, which
presented CVD outcomes data for PCSK9 inhibitors.11 As a
final note on limitations, the nature of adjunctive therapy
added to statins was not identified.
In summary, healthcare teams are trying to follow
guidelines for treating patients at high-risk of ASCVD
events, but they frequently encounter barriers to approval of
PCSK9 inhibitor prescription reimbursement. Healthcare
teams are motivated to overcome these barriers to continue
to provide high-quality care to patients who cannot achieve
LDL-C targets with statins alone. Training of those
involved in the application process and good documenta-
tion have the potential to improve individualized care of
high-risk patients. Persistence with failed applications is
important and can be summarized by this quote from
Thomas Edison: ‘‘Our greatest weakness lies in giving up.
The most certain way to succeed is always to try just one
more time.’’
