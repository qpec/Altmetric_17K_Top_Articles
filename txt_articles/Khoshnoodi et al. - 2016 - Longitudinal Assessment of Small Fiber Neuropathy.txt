IMPORTANCE Few data are available on the natural history of small fiber neuropathy (SNF).
Peripheral neuropathy typically follows a length-dependent pattern, leading us to
hypothesize that patients with SFN would lose intraepidermal nerve fibers at the distal leg
more quickly than at more proximal thigh sites.
OBJECTIVE To compare the longitudinal rate and pattern of intraepidermal nerve fiber
density (IENFD) change in idiopathic SFN (iSFN), impaired glucose tolerance–associated SFN
(IGT-SFN), and diabetes mellitus–associated SFN (DM-SFN).
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS In this longitudinal, case-control study, patients
diagnosed as having SFN from January 1, 2002, through December 31, 2010, and age- and
sex-matched controls underwent additional evaluation at tertiary outpatient neurology
clinics. Participants and healthy controls were evaluated twice separated by at least 2 years.
Participants underwent standardized examinations, nerve conduction, and skin biopsy at
3 sites along the leg. A linear mixed-effects model was used to compare rates of IENFD
decrease between cause and biopsy site.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES We compared the rate of IENFD loss over time in subjects
with iSFN, IGT-SFN and DM-SFN as well as the spatiotemporal pattern of IENF loss at different
rostal-caudal sites along the leg.
RESULTS Fifty-two participants (25 with iSFN, 13 with IGT-SFN, and 14 with DM-SFN) and 10
healthy controls were evaluated. Mean (SD) ages were 50.9 (12.9), 63.1 (10.4), and 61.6 (11.6)
years for the iSFN, IGT-SFN, and DM-SFN groups, respectively. There were 12, 7, and 8 female
patients and 13, 6, and 6 male patients in the iSFN, IGT-SFN, and DM-SFN groups,
respectively. The mean follow-up time was 24.2, 26.7, and 38.8 months for those with iSFN,
IGT-SFN, and DM-SFN, respectively, and 32 months for healthy controls. At baseline, mean
(SE) for distal leg IENFD (6.48 [1.06]) was lower than distal thigh (13.32 [1.08]) and proximal
thigh IENFD (19.98 [1.07]) (P = .001). In addition, IENFD was significantly lower in patients
with DM-SFN and IGT-SFN compared with iSFN at all biopsy sites (P = .001). All 3 neuropathy
groups had significant IENFD decrease at follow-up at all 3 sites (P = .002), whereas there
was no change in the control group. The mean yearly rates of IENFD change over time at the
distal leg, distal thigh, and proximal thigh irrespective of cause are −1.42, −1.59, and −2.8 fibers
per millimeter, respectively. The mean slopes of IENFD change over time by cause regardless
of biopsy site are −0.179, −0.164, and −0.198 for iSFN, IGT-SFN, and DM-SFN, respectively.
No difference was found between SFN groups in the rate of decrease. The rate of IENFD
decrease was similar at all 3 biopsy sites.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Similar rates of IENFD decrease irrespective of cause were
observed. Epidermal nerve fibers were lost at similar rates in proximal and distal sites,
suggesting that SFN is a non–length-dependent terminal axonopathy.

S
mall fiber neuropathy (SFN), is a common1 distinct axo-
nal neuropathy that predominantly affects thinly
myelinated and unmyelinated fibers and presents with
a combination of neuropathic pain, hypoesthesia to pain and
temperature sensation, and autonomic dysfunction.2 It can be
a predominant or heralding feature of a generalized process
that involves large and small fibers,3,4 or it can be a distinct
disorder that predominantly affects small fibers. Clinical diag-
nosis of SFN can be challenging, and physical examination
and functional assessments, such as nerve conduction studies
(NCSs) or quantitative sensory tests, have limited diagnostic
efficacy. Skin biopsy with intraepidermal nerve fiber (IENF)
quantification is a useful diagnostic test to identify SFN with a
diagnostic accuracy of approximately 88%.5-8 The cause of
SFN is not always clear. Up to half of the cases can be idio-
pathic SFN (iSFN), with diabetes mellitus–associated SFN
(DM-SFN) and impaired glucose tolerance–associated SFN
(IGT-SFN) also common.9
Typically, SFN is a distal, symmetric neuropathy with pa-
tients experiencing symptoms in a length-dependent pat-
tern. A non–length-dependent type of SFN has also been re-
ported in which the presentation of symptoms is patchy and
IENF density (IENFD) is more prominently reduced in proxi-
mal sites relative to distal sites. In the length-dependent SFN,
there is usually a gradient between the reduced density in the
proximal and distal site that is not observed in the non–length-
dependentcases,butneverthelessthereisareductionofnerve
fiber densities in areas that are asymptomatic. This observa-
tion raises the possibility that even in cases that clinically
present as a length-dependent SFN, the process might in-
stead be a non–length-dependent terminal axonopathy.
There are limited longitudinal data regarding disease pro-
gression in patients with SFN. It is known that the correlation
between IENFD and symptoms, such as neuropathic pain, is
nonlinear and complex, and stability of clinical presentation
cannot be interpreted as stability of the neuropathic process.
In the current study, we longitudinally followed up patients
with iSFN, IGT-SFN, and DM-SFN to explore progression over
time. In addition, we were interested in the pattern of IENFD
change at all 3 biopsy sites over time.
Methods
Study Participants
Patients with iSFN, DM-SFN, and IGT-SFN who were seen clini-
cally from January 1, 2002, through December 31, 2010, were
eligible. To qualify, individuals had to have physical examina-
tion, NCS, skin biopsy, and Neuropathy Impairment Score of
the Lower Limb (NIS-LL) results available. Patients were diag-
nosed as having predominant SFN based on clinical presenta-
tion (hyperesthesia, allodynia, reduced sensation to pinprick
and temperature but preserved vibratory and proprioceptive
sensation, normal deep tendon reflexes) plus reduced IENFD
on either set of skin biopsy specimens or the presence of large
axon swelling and normal NCS results. These criteria are con-
sistent with a previous study6 reporting that a combination of
reduced IENFD and clinical findings can be used as diagnostic
criteria for SFN and studies10-12 reporting that axon swellings
can predict progressive reduction in IENFD. Qualified indi-
viduals (ie, electromyography technicians, laboratory techni-
cians, examining physician) were invited back for masked re-
peatassessments,includingexamination(NIS-LL),skinbiopsy,
and NCS through a research protocol. Controls had normal pe-
ripheral nerve examination findings (vibration using a Rydell
tuning fork, intact pin sensation at the toe, accurately de-
tected 0.4-g monofilament at the foot) and no risk factors for
peripheral neuropathy. Control subjects were selected from a
database of over 150 controls based upon age and gender in
order to achieve group matching with study subjects.
The Johns Hopkins Institutional Review Board approved
this study; all participants signed consent forms. Data were
deidentified.
Diabetes mellitus was defined as having a hemoglobin A1c
level greater than 6.5% (to convert to proportion of hemoglo-
bin, multiply by 0.01), a fasting plasma glucose level higher
than 126 mg/dL (to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by
0.0555), or a random plasma glucose level of 200 mg/dL or
higher (to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.0555).
Impaired glucose tolerance was defined as a plasma glucose
level of 140 to 199 mg/dL 2 hours after a 75-g oral glucose load
and a hemoglobin A1c level less than 6.5%.13 Other potential
causes of SFN, such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV),
Sjögren syndrome, paraproteinemia, paraneoplastic syn-
dromes, vitamin B12 deficiency, hypothyroidism, renal and he-
patic dysfunction, alcohol abuse, and hereditary neuropa-
thies, were excluded.
Skin Biopsy
Skin punch biopsies (3 mm) were performed with the patient
under lidocaine local anesthesia, as previously described.14 Bi-
opsy specimens were obtained from the distal leg (DL), distal
thigh (DT), and proximal thigh (PT) at baseline and follow-
up. Further details are in the eMethods in the Supplement.
Statistical Analysis
Group comparisons were made by multivariate general linear
model (GLM) analysis of variance (ANOVA). A GLM with repeti-
tive measures was used to compare NIS-LL and IENFD within
groupsbetweenbaselineandthefollow-upfrom3locationsand
among the SFN groups. The change in IENFD was defined as
IENFDfollow-up – IENFDbaseline. To correct for baseline IENFD
Key Points
Question What are the rate and pattern of progression of axon
loss in patients with small fiber neuropathy (SFN)?
Findings In this longitudinal, case-control study, patients with
SFN experience progressive loss of intraepidermal nerve fibers in 2
to 3 years, with many developing large fiber involvement. There
was no difference in the rate of progression between individuals
with idiopathic, impaired glucose tolerance–associated, or
diabetes mellitus–associated SFN.
Meaning The distal terminals of unmyelinated nerve fibers are
preferentially vulnerable irrespective of axon length.

differences and variable follow-up periods, the percentage of
IENFD change from baseline per year was calculated as
[(IENFDfollow-up – IENFDbaseline)/IENFDbaseline]/(Follow-up
Duration) × 100. A multivariate GLM ANOVA was used to com-
parethechange,percentageofchangefrombaseline,andthese
measures per year. In addition, linear regression was per-
formed using IENFD as the dependent variable and time of bi-
opsy, location of biopsy, and the cause of SFN as the indepen-
dent variables to use the correlation coefficient (slope of the
fittedline)asanindependentunit-freemeasuretocomparethe
rate of change in IENFD by biopsy location and cause. A nega-
tiveslopeindicatesanIENFDdecreaseovertime.Analyseswere
performedusingSPSSstatisticalsoftware,version19(SPSSInc).
Although the underlying process of nerve degeneration is
not fully understood, especially at the level of the individual
nerve, we performed an additional analysis that assumed that
IENFDlossovertimeisnotlinearbutratherdependentonIENFD
still being intact. To represent this process and better estimate
the differences in rates of nerve loss over time at the 3 leg sites,
we fit an exponential decay model to the data. This model took
the form of Nt = N0e
−λt, where N0 is the IENFD count at base-
line, Nt is IENFD at time t, t is follow-up time in years, and λ is
the rate of decay. This can also be represented as the derivative
Nt
dt = 
λN0.
To make results more translatable to clinical practice, we fit
an equivalent model to estimate the percentage lost per year.
This model took the form Nt = N0(1 − p)t, where p is the per-
centage of nerves lost per year. Results from the latter model
are reported here. We fit these models to the data using a non-
linear regression using least squares to estimate the param-
eters λ and ρ. Model fit was assessed using Akaike informa-
tioncriteria(AIC),andtestingforstatisticaldifferencesbetween
groups and was done through pairwise t tests. These analy-
ses were performed in R version 3.2.2.
Results
Fourteen individuals with DM-SFN, 25 with iSFN, and 13 with
IGT-SFN were included in the study (Table 1). Follow-up du-
ration was similar in the groups: mean (SD) 24.2 (17.9) monthly
for iSFN, 26.7 (10.8) monthly for IGT-SFN, and 37.8 (22.7)
monthly for DM-SFN (F2 = 1.845, P = .17). The most common
reason for individuals not participating was the time require-
ment. Individuals who did not participate had similar demo-
graphics and baseline neuropathy measurements. Results of
the baseline NCSs are summarized in Table 1. Those with iSFN
had higher sural amplitudes than those with IGT-SFN or DM-
SFN: mean (SD) 12.67 (1.68) vs. 11.56 (2.53) and 8.49 (1.46)
(F2 = 4.207, P = .02). There was no difference in NIS-LL val-
ues at follow-up among those with DM-SFN and iSFN
(F2 = 3.916, P = .052). Controls had similar ages and sex com-
positions (eTable 1 in the Supplement).
The IENFD values stratified by biopsy site and cause are
summarized in Figure 1. At baseline, DL IENFD was signifi-
cantlylowercomparedwithDTandPTIENFD:mean(SE)fordis-
talleg6.48(1.06);fordistalthigh13.32(1.08);forproximalthigh
19.98 (1.07) (F42 = 54.296, P = .001). The IENFD was signifi-
cantly lower in patients with DM-SFN and IGT-SFN compared
with patients with iSFN at all sites (F2 = 8.030, P = .001). At fol-
low-up, there was a significant IENFD decrease at all 3 sites
(F42 = 10.903,P = .002).TherewasnodifferenceamongtheSFN
groups in the IENFD reduction over time (F42 = 0.035, P = .96).
Furthermore, the IENFD decreases were similar irrespective of
the biopsy site (F42 = 2.436, P = .10), suggesting that, although
atbaselinetherewasadistal,length-dependentpatterninIENFD
reduction, over time there is a uniform reduction in IENFD at
proximal and distal sites regardless of cause (Figure 1).
We further examined the hypothesis that IENFD de-
creases at a similar rate in both proximal and distal biopsy sites
by comparing the rate of change in IENFD (Figure 2) and the-

site and cause (Table 2). Multivariate ANOVA revealed no dif-
ference in these measures among the 3 leg sites (F4 = 0.885,
P = .47), cause of neuropathy (F4 = 0.523, P = .72), or interac-
tion of these factors (F8 = 0.642, P = .74; Figure 2). Similarly,

ent rates of nerve loss across biopsy sites or across condi-
tions.However,wedidfindquantitativelyhigherratesofnerve
loss with increasing nerve length (eTable 2 in the Supple-
ment). This finding was similarly observed within each con-
dition. The rates of IENFD loss were greatest among individu-
als with IGT-SFN and lowest in those with DM-SFN, although
these findings were also not significant. All estimated rates of
nerve loss were significantly greater than 0, with the excep-
tion of DL IGT-SFN, which was likely attributable to low num-
bers (n = 13) and a high proportion with a count of 0 at the fol-
low-up visit (9 [69%] of 13). The eFigure in the Supplement

over time by cause regardless of biopsy site are −0.179, −0.164,
and −0.198 for iSFN, IGT-SFN, and DM-SFN, respectively. To-
gether, these data indicate comparable rates of decrease across
biopsy sites, suggesting that the pattern of unmyelinated fiber
loss is more consistent with a non–length-dependent distal
axonopathythanalength-dependentprocess(Figure3).Incon-
trast, healthy controls had stable IENFD at the 3 sites for a
comparable period (eTable 3 in the Supplement).
Follow-up data from the NCSs revealed that 5 patients with
DM-SFN (36%), 4 patients with IGT-SFN (31%), and 5 patients
with iSFN (21%) developed a mild large fiber neuropathy and
reduced ankle reflexes and vibratory sensation at the time of
the follow-up visit. There was no progression to IGT-SFN or
DM-SFN among 13 of the 25 patients with iSFN for whom there
was follow-up hemoglobin A1c data.
Discussion
Patients with predominant SFN of different causes were pro-
spectively followed up to characterize the spatiotemporal
pathologic progression of IENFD. Despite a relatively stable
clinical course with respect to NIS-LL, IENFD decreased over
time. The rate of IENF loss is similar among patients with iSFN,
DM-SFN, and IGT-DM. In addition, the data suggest that de-
spitealength-dependentclinicalpresentation,epidermalnerve
fibers are lost at similar rates along different rostral and cau-
dal locations in the leg. This finding suggests that SFN follows
a pattern of a non–length-dependent terminal axonopathy and
not a length-dependent process based on slowly progressive
distal to proximal axonal degeneration (dying back).
To our knowledge, relatively few longitudinal data regard-
ing the natural course of SFN exist. In a retrospective study6
of 46 patients, more than half did not experience any wors-
ening during a 2-year period. Similarly, in the Rochester dia-
beticneuropathystudy,only approximately3%ofpatientswith
diabetic neuropathy reported subjective worsening of symp-
toms associated with function of small sensory fibers, such as
pain and paresthesia, after 2 years, and only approximately 8%
experiencedworseninginquantitativesensorytestingresults.15
In patients with symptoms of SFN with low-normal IENFD as-
sociated with prominent axonal swellings, IENFD decreased
significantly at both sites at similar rates during 19 months.10
The clinical findings of this study are in agreement with pre-
vious data that iSFN is a slowly progressive disease. In con-
trast,IENFDdecreasedovertimeinallpatientsatasimilarrate.

IENFD was observed to decrease more in the distal leg compared with the
proximal thigh and more in patients with diabetes mellitus–associated small
fiber neuropathy (DM-SFN) and impaired glucose tolerance–associated small
fiber neuropathy (IGT-SFN) than in patients with idiopathic small fiber
neuropathy (iSFN). Over time, there was a similar decrease in IENFD in the distal
and proximal sites of biopsy with similar rates among patients with DM-SFN,
IGT-SFM, and iSFN. Error bars indicate 95% CIs.

IENFD between distal and proximal sites at baseline, the rate of
decrease in IENFD was similar across the 3 sites in all 3 groups
of patients. The reason that DL IENFD is more reduced at early

Dying back is a common pattern seen in many degenera-
tive and toxic conditions of the peripheral nervous systems.17
The pathophysiologic mechanism of distal axonal degenera-
tion is incompletely understood, but the longest nerve fibers,
presumably with higher metabolic demand, are postulated to
be most susceptible to dying back. It has been suggested that
distal axonal degeneration represents a lack of support to the
mostdistalprojectionsoftheaxon.18,19Weobservedsimilarrates
of IENF loss at proximal and distal sites, suggesting that axon
length is less important in determining vulnerability. The pat-
tern of disease progression in our patients with SFN is a non–
length-dependent distal axonopathy and could be interpreted
as evidence of the interaction between SFN terminals and its
target (the skin) playing a critical role. Target-derived growth
factors that are retrogradely transported to the neuronal cell
body are critical during development and may continue to be
vital into adulthood. Alternatively, fast retrograde transport,
which is less affected by axon length, may contribute to SFN as
reported with degenerative diseases,20 including Alzheimer
disease,21 Parkinson disease,22 amyotrophic lateral sclerosis,23
and chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy.24 To-
gether,theseobservationsareconsistentwiththeincreasingim-
pression that distal portions of axons are selectively vulner-
able in peripheral neuropathy. In DM, the peripheral nerve has
metabolicderangementsthatarenotpresentproximallyindor-
sal root ganglion.25,26 Similarly, in HIV, distal portions of nerve
have higher rates of mitochondrial deletions compared with
proximal portions or dorsal root ganglion.27 In chemotherapy-
induced peripheral neuropathy, mitochondria are dysmorphic
andreducedinnumberinaxonterminalsthatcorrelatewiththe
cumulative chemotherapy doses.28
These findings are consistent with evidence indicating in-
volvement of distal axons in other organs of patients with neu-

ropathy. In patients with DM, with or without distal symmet-
ricneuropathy,thedensityofcornealnervefibersisreduced,29
and patients with non–length-dependent presentation of SFN
also have a similar reduction in corneal nerve fiber density.30
Unmyelinated C fibers in the bladder mucosa of patients with
DM have reduced responsiveness early in the disease that cor-
relates with hypofunction of unmyelinated fibers in both up-
per and lower extremities.31 These observations are consistent
with the longitudinal data presented here that SFN follows a
non–length-dependent distal axonopathy, even in the cases
where it clinically presents as a length-dependent neuropathy.
The present data can have important clinical implica-
tions. The diagnostic criteria and identification of a sensitive
and specific cutoff for IENFD have focused on DL, based on the
assumption that SFN is a length-dependent process. There is
worldwide normative data available for IENFD at DL,32 and the
current guidelines recommend a DL skin biopsy, whereas a
proximal biopsy is considered a level C recommendation for a
non–length-dependent process.33 Our data suggest that IENFD
from proximal sites can be informative as well, including cases
that clinically present as a classic distal symmetric SFN with a
stocking-and-glove distribution. Furthermore, our data also
suggest that follow-up skin biopsies and monitoring of the rate
ofreductioninIENFDcouldbeareliablemarkerfordiseasepro-
gression in treatment trials. This is of particular interest given
the inherent challenges of available clinical scales as outcome
measures in clinical trials and natural history studies.15
One limitation of the current study is that we simplified
the analysis by only looking at the cause of SFN and the loca-
tion of the skin biopsy as independent variables and did not
include other variables that might affect progression of neu-
ropathy (eg, medications such as angiotensin-converting en-
zyme inhibitors, comorbidities, and serum lipid levels) known
to affect neuropathy progression.34-37 Another limitation is the
relatively small sample size.
Conclusions
We observed that patients with SFN, irrespective of cause,
experienced progressive axon loss during 2 to 3 years of
follow-up, with many developing large fiber dysfunction. The
rate of axon loss in IGT-SFN was similar to that in DM-SFN or
iSFN. The spaciotemporal pattern of axon loss indicates that
the distal terminals of axons are selectively vulnerable irre-
spective of axon length. This finding suggests that SFN is a
non–length-dependent distal axonopathy and not a length-
dependent process.

of the longer axons are preferentially lost while more proximal sites remain
constant. Right, Pattern observed in the study participants where distal
projections of axons were lost at equal rates irrespective of rostral and caudal
location along the leg. Gray fibers represent nerve fiber branches that have
degenerated, whereas black nerve fibers are healthy. The flow of sand through
the hourglasses depicts the rate of epidermal nerve fiber loss at each site. Blue
