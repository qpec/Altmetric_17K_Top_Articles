Objective. Subjective crepitus is the reporting of hearing grating, cracking, or popping sounds in and/or around a
joint. We aimed to evaluate whether there is an association between crepitus and incident symptomatic knee
osteoarthritis (OA) in the Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI), a multicenter longitudinal US cohort.
Methods. Knees without baseline symptomatic OA were included. Crepitus frequency was assessed using a question from
the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score at baseline and at 12, 24, and 36 months. Frequent knee pain and radio-
graphs were assessed at baseline and at annual visits up to 48 months. Radiographic OA was defined as a tibiofemoral
Kellgren/Lawrence grade ≥2. Symptomatic OA was defined as a knee with both frequent symptoms and radiographic OA.
We performed a repeated-measures analysis with a predictor of crepitus and outcome of incident symptomatic OA,
adjusting for age, sex, and body mass index (BMI), with those never reporting crepitus as the referent group.
Results. There were a total of 3,495 participants (42.2% male), with mean � SD age of 61.1 � 9.2 years and a mean �
SD BMI of 28.2 � 4.7 kg/m². The odds of incident symptomatic OA were higher with greater frequency of crepitus
(never, rarely, sometimes, often, and always, with adjusted odds ratios of (referent), 1.5, 1.8, 2.2, and 3.0, respectively;
P < 0.0001 for trend). The group with radiographic OA at OAI baseline but without symptoms contributed 26% of the
observations but more than 75% of the incident symptomatic OA cases.
Conclusion. In those without symptomatic OA, subjective knee crepitus predicts incident symptomatic OA longitudi-
nally, with most cases occurring in those with preexisting tibiofemoral radiographic OA but without frequent knee
pain. However, an important limitation is that patellofemoral OA was not systematically evaluated within the OAI.
Subjective crepitus offers utility for the identification of at-risk individuals, predictive modeling, and future research.
INTRODUCTION
Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common form of arthritis
and one of the leading causes of chronic pain and disabil-
ity. It is highly prevalent in the US, afflicting an estimated
30.8 million adults annually in 2008–2011 (1). Because the
population ≥65 years is expected to grow, and 35% of the
overall adult population is obese (2,3), the prevalence of
OA will likely increase because older age and obesity are
strong risk factors for knee OA (4–9). Symptomatic knee
OA, defined as radiographic evidence of OA plus frequent
pain, has an estimated prevalence of approximately 16% in
US adults ages 60 years and older (10), with higher preva-
lence as age and body mass index (BMI) increase (11).

 In the clinical setting, patients frequently ask whether
crepitus should be concerning to them or not. Subjective
crepitus is the reporting of hearing grating, cracking, or
popping sounds in and/or around a joint. Although this
is a common sign in the clinical setting (12) and has
been shown to be associated with prevalent OA based on
contemporaneous magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and
radiographs (13–15), it is unclear whether the report of
crepitus is predictive of worsening OA. In this study, we
aimed to evaluate whether subjective crepitus is predic-
tive of incident symptomatic OA. The identification of
an association would support the idea that crepitus is
clinically
important
and
predicts
who
will
develop
symptomatic OA. Therefore, the objective of this study
was to evaluate whether there is an association between
crepitus and incident symptomatic knee OA.
PATIENTS AND METHODS
Study design and sample selection. We performed a
person-based longitudinal study, evaluating the right
knee only, using data from the Osteoarthritis Initiative
(OAI), a longitudinal, observational study of knee OA
conducted at 4 clinical sites: Memorial Hospital of Rhode
Island (Pawtucket), Ohio State University (Columbus),
University of Pittsburgh, and University of Maryland/
Johns Hopkins University (Baltimore). At the time of
OAI enrollment (February 2004 through May 2006),
participants were 45–79 years of age. BMI was assessed at
baseline. The presence of crepitus and symptoms were
assessed at baseline and at annual followup visits. Knees
with preexisting symptomatic OA or arthroplasty at
baseline were excluded.
Subjective crepitus assessment. At OAI baseline, 12-,
24-, and 36-month clinic visits, crepitus frequency (never,
rarely, sometimes, often, or always) was assessed using
question 2 of the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome
Score (KOOS) (16) symptoms questionnaire: Do you feel
grinding, or hear clicking or any other type of noise when
your right knee moves?
Symptom assessment. An affirmative response to the
knee-specific frequent pain question (During the past 12
months, have you had pain, aching, or stiffness in or
around your right knee on most days [more than half the
days] for at least one month?) was used to define the
presence of frequent symptoms. Symptoms were ascer-
tained at baseline and at 12, 24, 36, and 48 months.
Additionally, at the OAI baseline visit, participants were
asked to self-report knee-specific pain in reference to the
last 7 days by completing the pain subscale of the Western
Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index
(WOMAC; 3.1 Likert version) (17). WOMAC possible pain
scores range from 0 (no pain) to 20 (severe pain).
Acquisition of knee radiographs. Bilateral, fixed-flexion
posteroanterior knee radiographs (18) were obtained at the
OAI baseline and annual clinic visits through 48 months.
Films were obtained with the participant in a standing
position with knees flexed 20–30 degrees and feet rotated
internally 10 degrees. A SynaFlexer plexiglass frame was
used to fix the position of the knees and feet (19). Central
readers assessed OA severity using Kellgren/Lawrence
(K/L) grading (range 0–4). The kappa coefficient for these
measures ranged from 0.70–0.80 (20).
Outcome definitions. Generalized estimating equations
(GEEs) only allow for adjustment for correlation across 1
variable (21). Because we planned repeated-measures
analyses and needed to adjust for correlations across
visits, we would not have been able to adjust for
correlation
between knees
within
a
person
had
we
included both knees in the models. Therefore, we only
included right knees in our analyses. Symptoms were
defined by the symptoms question. Radiographic OA was
defined as a tibiofemoral K/L grade ≥2. Symptomatic OA
was defined as a knee that had both symptomatic and
radiographic OA. Any participant with a knee arthroplasty
was identified as having symptoms, radiographic OA, and
symptomatic OA.
Statistical analysis. SAS, version 9.4, was used for all
analyses. We used Spearman correlations to evaluate
whether there was an association between baseline crepitus
and WOMAC pain score and K/L grade. We performed
repeated-measures logistic regression using GEE with an
exchangeable correlation structure to adjust for correlations
in within-person observations over time, where the pre-
dictor was subjective crepitus frequency at baseline and at
month 12, 24, and 36, and the outcome was incident right
knee symptomatic OA 1 year subsequent to crepitus
assessments. For instance, a participant who did not have
symptomatic OA would be included in the analysis with a
baseline crepitus assessment and symptomatic OA assess-
ment at 12 months. If the participant did not develop
symptomatic OA by the 12-month visit, his/her crepitus
assessment at 12 months would be the predictor, and the
outcome of symptomatic OA at 24 months would be
evaluated. This would continue until the participant
developed symptomatic OA or arrived at the 48-month
visit, whichever came first. Each participant could con-
tribute up to 4 observation periods. Once a participant
Significance & Innovations
• This is the first study to find an association between
self-reported crepitus and incident symptomatic
knee osteoarthritis (OA).
• Of those who developed symptomatic OA, more
than 75% had prevalent radiographic OA but no
frequent knee pain at baseline. Selecting individ-
uals with radiographic OA but without frequent
knee pain may increase power in studies evaluat-
ing incident symptomatic OA.
• Subjective knee crepitus can be used clinically to
identify individuals at risk for symptomatic OA,
potentially assisting with earlier diagnosis and
ultimately with intervention.

Lo et al
 developed incident symptomatic OA, he/she was censored
from the analysis. The adjusted model included age, sex,
and BMI. Cochran-Armitage tests were used to test for
significance of trends (22,23).
To better understand the groups that contributed to the
association of crepitus with symptomatic OA, we per-
formed post hoc analyses of 3 subgroups that were based
on OAI baseline (i.e., at the time of enrollment into the
OAI) and radiographic OA and symptoms status, with
group 1 being those with radiographic OA but no frequent
symptoms (+ROA, �Sx), group 2 being those without
radiographic OA but with frequent symptoms (�ROA,
+Sx), and group 3 being those without radiographic OA
and without frequent symptoms at baseline (�ROA, �Sx).
Because the natural history of OA is long, we were
interested in seeing whether a longer followup period (4
years instead of 1 year) between the assessment of crepi-
tus and the outcome of symptomatic OA would yield
different results than our original analyses in which we
allowed for only 1 year of followup. Thus, we repeated
the analyses, with the predictor limited to crepitus at the
OAI baseline visit and the outcome of interest of incident
symptomatic OA by the OAI 48-month visit. This meant
that if a participant developed incident symptomatic OA
at the 36-month visit, then he/she was identified as
developing incident symptomatic OA by the 48-month
visit. In these analyses, each participant contributed 1
observation.
We tested for interactions between crepitus with age,
sex, and BMI. Because there were significant interactions
for age and sex, we also showed the results of subgroup
analyses evaluating men versus women and younger
(<65 years old) versus older (≥65 years old) participants.
RESULTS
Of 4,796 OAI participants, the following were excluded
from the study: 35 who already had arthroplasty at the time
of OAI enrollment, 305 who did not have K/L grade read-
ings in the right knee at the baseline visit, 877 who had pre-
existing symptomatic OA of the right knee at the baseline
visit, and 84 who did not have any valid outcome measure
assessments of symptomatic OA at any of the followup visit
time points. This left 3,495 participants eligible for inclu-
sion in our study. In total, 750 observations had missing
information on the outcome of symptomatic OA and were
excluded from analyses, representing 6.3% of the overall
11,994 potential observations. An additional 7 observations
had missing information on crepitus as a predictor.
Overall, 3,495 people contributed 11,237 observations to
the analyses, with the outcome of incident symptomatic
OA 1 year subsequent to crepitus assessment (Table 1).
Participants had a mean � SD age of 61.1 � 9.2 years and a
mean BMI of 28.2 � 4.7 kg/m2; 42.2% were male. Crepitus
frequency prevalence for the responses none, rarely, some-
times, often, and always were 7,313 (65.1%), 1,213
(10.8%), 1,701 (15.1%), 626 (5.6%), and 384 (3.4%),
respectively. Cross-sectionally at the baseline visit, there
was a correlation between crepitus and WOMAC pain
score (R = 0.33, P < 0.0001), but there was no correlation
between crepitus and K/L grade (R = 0.03, P = 0.1). The
distribution of crepitus frequency by K/L score is shown
in Supplementary Table 1 (available on the Arthritis Care
& Research web site at http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/
10.1002/acr.23246/abstract). The overall number of inci-
dent cases of symptomatic OA among 3,495 individuals
was 636, for an incidence rate of 18.1%. In the first
through fourth observation periods, there were 258, 159,
126, and 93 respective incident symptomatic OA cases. In
the unadjusted and adjusted models, the odds of subse-
quent development of incident symptomatic OA increased
with increasing frequency of crepitus, with a statistically
significant P for trend (Table 1).
To better understand which groups contributed most to
the incident symptomatic OA cases, we performed post
hoc subgroup analyses (Table 2) specifically evaluating
those people with radiographic OA but without symptoms
at baseline (+ROA, �Sx), without radiographic OA but
with symptoms at baseline (�ROA, +Sx), and those with-
out radiographic OA or symptoms at baseline (�ROA,
�Sx). The symptomatic OA incidence rate in those with
radiographic OA but without symptoms at baseline was
45.0% (488 of 1,085), in those without radiographic OA
but with symptoms at baseline was 10.2% (67 of 660), and
in those without radiographic OA or symptoms at baseline
was 4.6% (81 of 1,750). In each of these groups, crepitus
and WOMAC pain score were correlated (R = 0.31, R =
0.20, and R = 0.25, respectively; P < 0.0001 for all), but
crepitus and K/L score were not (R = �0.007, P = 0.8; R =
�0.01, P = 0.7; and R = 0.04, P = 0.07, respectively). People
with radiographic OA but without symptoms at baseline
showed similar results to that of the whole group and con-
tributed 488 of 636 (76.7%) of the total incident symp-
tomatic OA cases (Table 2). In the first through fourth
observation periods, there were 213, 126, 84, and 65
respective incident symptomatic OA cases. In the other 2
subgroups, no significant association was found between
baseline crepitus and symptomatic OA (Table 2).
In the analyses with incident symptomatic OA over 4 years
as the outcome, the same 3,495 participants were included,
contributing 1 observation each. Crepitus frequency preva-
lence for the responses none, rarely, sometimes, often, and

(6.6%), and 119 (3.4%), respectively. In these analyses, we
found a similar overall result, where adjusted odds ratios for
incident symptomatic OA were greater in those with greater
crepitus frequency (Table 3). In the post hoc analyses evalu-
ating the subgroups that developed incident symptomatic
OA (Table 4), again those with preexisting radiographic OA
who did not have frequent knee symptoms, representing
approximately one third of the overall sample, contributed
most of the incident symptomatic OA cases (488 of 636, or
76.7% of cases). In the group that had preexisting frequent
knee symptoms but did not have radiographic OA, represent-
ing the smallest subgroup, greater crepitus frequency was not
predictive of symptomatic OA over 4 years, similar to the 1-
year followup analyses. The group that did not have preexist-
ing frequent knee symptoms and did not have radiographic
OA represented the largest proportion of observations, at
54.5% (6,127 of 11,237), and had the lowest proportion of
incident symptomatic OA, at 4.6% (81 of 1,750). In this
group, crepitus was not associated with incident symp-
tomatic OA over 1 year, but it was in the 4-year analyses (P
for trend = 0.03) (Table 4).
We found significant interactions between crepitus and
sex and crepitus and age overall and in the group of par-
ticipants with radiographic OA but without frequent
knee symptoms at baseline (Table 5). Subgroup analyses
of men versus women showed that, although the overall
number of incident cases of symptomatic OA was lower
in men than in women, the association between crepitus
and incident symptomatic OA revealed larger odds ratios
(Table 6). Similarly, although there were fewer incident
symptomatic OA cases in older participants, crepitus fre-
quency indicated a larger odds ratio for incident symp-
tomatic OA than that in younger participants (Table 6).
These findings from subgroup analyses comparing men
versus women and older versus younger participants
were similar in the group of participants with radio-
graphic OA but without frequent knee symptoms (see

DISCUSSION
Within the OAI, a US-based multicenter cohort, we
found that subjective crepitus was predictive of incident
symptomatic tibiofemoral OA. The majority of incident
cases of symptomatic OA occurred in the subgroup of
people who had prevalent radiographic OA at baseline
but no frequent knee symptoms (+ROA, �Sx) where
crepitus was predictive of the development of frequent
knee pain within a year and over 4 years of observation.
For those who had neither frequent symptoms nor radio-
graphic OA, crepitus was predictive of the development
of radiographic evidence of tibiofemoral OA over a
longer time frame but not over 1 year of followup. These
findings suggest that crepitus is indeed a useful symptom
to predict the development of symptomatic OA over
time. To our knowledge, this is the first study to evaluate
the association of crepitus with incident symptomatic
knee OA.
The existing literature on crepitus is limited to the assess-
ment of the physical examination finding of crepitus, as
compared to our study, in which the subjective reporting of
crepitus was studied. Further, the existing studies have
focused on cross-sectional associations, evaluating the con-
temporaneous implications of crepitus, not longitudinal
associations like we have evaluated in our study. Crepitus
by compartment on exam is associated with the contempo-
raneous presence of compartment-specific osteophytes
(24–26), meaning crepitus palpated in the patellofemoral
compartment was predictive of patellofemoral osteophytes

Knee OA and Crepitus

 and crepitus in the medial and lateral tibiofemoral com-
partments were predictive of medial and lateral tibiofe-
moral osteophytes, respectively. The association between
crepitus and articular cartilage damage is less clear. Two
studies suggest that there is an association (25,26), while
the other does not (24). In one study, patellofemoral crepi-
tus was also associated with patellofemoral cysts and bone
marrow lesions as seen on MRI (26). An important limita-
tion to our study is that patellofemoral OA was not system-
atically evaluated within the OAI. Thus, within the context
of this study, performed within the OAI, we were unable to
tease out the role of the patellofemoral compartment in the
relationship between crepitus and incident symptomatic
OA. The lack of inclusion of the patellofemoral compart-
ment in our assessment of radiographic OA may provide an
explanation for why baseline crepitus was not associated
with K/L grade overall or in any of the subgroups. This is in
contrast to the study by Crema et al (24) where skyline
radiographs were included in the assessment of K/L grade,
which was associated with physical examination–detected
crepitus, in a cohort screened to have early knee OA. Inves-
tigation of these questions in a different cohort that has
assessments of crepitus in addition to readings for patello-
femoral OA will provide additional important insights into
the clinical importance of crepitus.
In our study, we also found that there was a significant
interaction of crepitus with age and crepitus with sex in
the development of incident symptomatic OA. Crepitus
frequency resulted in larger odds ratios for incident symp-
tomatic OA in men versus women and in older versus
younger participants. These findings suggest that crepitus
may identify different pathologies in these subgroups that
pre-date incident symptomatic OA. Nevertheless, crepitus
is predictive of incident symptomatic OA in all the sub-
groups, indicating that crepitus is clinically relevant in all
of these groups.
The assessment of crepitus used in our study was based
on a question from the KOOS questionnaire. This simple
assessment depends only on the patient reflecting on the
frequency that crepitus is present, thereby eliminating the

 need to train staff who can perform an examination to
assess crepitus. Although the KOOS question that assesses
crepitus does not allow for attribution of the compartment
from which the crepitus emanates, we have found that it is
predictive of the development of symptomatic tibiofemoral
OA. Interestingly, we found crepitus to be associated with
WOMAC pain among all groups, including the overall
group and all subgroups, which might mean that crepitus is
a manifestation of knee symptoms. Notably, the correla-
tions, though significant, were on the order of 0.2–0.3, not
close to 1, suggesting that crepitus and pain do represent
different constructs. Perhaps selecting those with more
crepitus from those with or without frequent knee pain is a
way of selecting those with more knee symptoms.
An interesting finding in our study relates to the distribu-
tion of new cases of symptomatic OA among those without
symptomatic OA at baseline. More than 75% of the incident
symptomatic OA cases originated from those who had radio-
graphic OA but no frequent knee symptoms, despite this
group constituting less than one third of the total number of
participants at risk for symptomatic OA. The group with fre-
quent knee symptoms but no radiographic OA had far fewer
incident symptomatic OA cases, and did not show an associ-
ation between crepitus frequency and incident symptomatic
OA, even when evaluated over the longer 4-year followup
period. The group with no preexisting radiographic OA or
frequent knee symptoms did not show an association
between crepitus and symptomatic OA over 1 year of
followup, but did over longer followup. Because both
symptoms and radiographic OA would have been required
to achieve an outcome of symptomatic OA in this group,
there may not have been sufficient time in 1 year for both to
occur.
The biologic implications of the findings of our study
in the context of existing literature are substantially
assisted by the findings from the post hoc analyses. The
finding that crepitus is predictive of the development of
frequent knee pain in as little time as 1 year among those
who have radiographic OA but no frequent knee pain
suggests that crepitus is not just selecting out those who
have an osteophyte, as all of those with radiographic OA
by definition have an osteophyte on radiograph. There is
some other risk factor that is being identified by the
report of crepitus that predisposes a person to the pro-
gression of knee OA symptoms. Further study of crepitus
in the group with radiographic OA but no frequent symp-
toms may help to clarify the sources of pain in knee OA.
The finding that crepitus is predictive of the development
of tibiofemoral knee OA among those without radio-
graphic OA or frequent knee pain only after 4 years of
observation, not with just 1 year of observation, suggests
that perhaps in this group of people, crepitus is preferen-
tially selecting out those who have patellofemoral osteo-
phytes, which cannot be evaluated on posteroanterior
films of the knee, and those who have patellofemoral OA
are more likely to develop tibiofemoral OA over a longer
period of observation. This would be an interesting
hypothesis to test in another cohort in which patellofe-
moral OA status is available. Additionally, as MRI is
more sensitive than radiographs, a longitudinal study
focusing on the MRI findings in this group of participants
who have crepitus as a predictor of incident symptomatic
OA may be informative in identifying early imaging
markers of OA.
In summary, subjective crepitus is a simple and effec-
tive assessment that is predictive of the longitudinal
development of symptomatic OA. It may offer utility for
the identification of at-risk individuals, predictive mod-
eling, and future clinical and epidemiologic research.
Future research should consider performing subgroup
analyses based on radiographic OA and symptoms status
to potentially assist with increasing our understanding of
the biologic implications of primary analyses. In the right
setting, the selection of individuals with prevalent radio-
graphic OA but without frequent knee symptoms may
strengthen the statistical power for studies evaluating
incident symptomatic OA as an outcome.
