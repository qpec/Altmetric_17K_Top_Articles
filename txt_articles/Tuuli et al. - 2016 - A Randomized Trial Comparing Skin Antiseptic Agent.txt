BACKGROUND
Preoperative skin antisepsis has the potential to decrease the risk of surgical-site 
infection. However, evidence is limited to guide the choice of antiseptic agent at 
cesarean delivery, which is the most common major surgical procedure among 
women in the United States.
METHODS
In this single-center, randomized, controlled trial, we evaluated whether the use of 
chlorhexidine–alcohol for preoperative skin antisepsis was superior to the use of 
iodine–alcohol for the prevention of surgical-site infection after cesarean delivery. 
We randomly assigned patients undergoing cesarean delivery to skin preparation 
with either chlorhexidine–alcohol or iodine–alcohol. The primary outcome was 
superficial or deep surgical-site infection within 30 days after cesarean delivery, on 
the basis of definitions from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
RESULTS
From September 2011 through June 2015, a total of 1147 patients were enrolled; 
572 patients were assigned to chlorhexidine–alcohol and 575 to iodine–alcohol. In 
an intention-to-treat analysis, surgical-site infection was diagnosed in 23 patients 
(4.0%) in the chlorhexidine–alcohol group and in 42 (7.3%) in the iodine–alcohol 
group (relative risk, 0.55; 95% confidence interval, 0.34 to 0.90; P 
= 
0.02). The rate 
of superficial surgical-site infection was 3.0% in the chlorhexidine–alcohol group 
and 4.9% in the iodine–alcohol group (P 
= 
0.10); the rate of deep infection was 
1.0% and 2.4%, respectively (P 
= 
0.07). The frequency of adverse skin reactions was 
similar in the two groups.
CONCLUSIONS
The use of chlorhexidine–alcohol for preoperative skin antisepsis resulted in a sig-
nificantly lower risk of surgical-site infection after cesarean delivery than did the use 
of iodine–alcohol. (Funded by the National Institutes of Health and Washington

C
esarean delivery is the most com-
mon major surgical procedure among 
women in the United States.1 In 2013, 
more than 32.7% (1.3 million) of the 3.9 million 
births were by cesarean section.2 Surgical-site 
infections complicate 2 to 5% of all surgical 
procedures and 5 to 12% of cesarean deliver-
ies.3-6 Infection occurring after delivery places an 
extra burden on the new mother and may im-
pair mother–infant bonding and breast-feed-
ing. The average attributable hospital cost per 
surgical-site infection after cesarean delivery is 
estimated to be $3,529.7
The skin is a major source of pathogens that 
cause surgical-site infections. Therefore, preop-
erative skin antisepsis has the potential to de-
crease the risk of surgical-site infection.8 Unfor-
tunately, there is a paucity of evidence to guide 
the choice of antiseptic agent at cesarean deliv-
ery.9 Three small trials, involving a total of 189 
participants, have been published comparing 
antiseptic agents for preoperative skin prepara-
tion at cesarean delivery; these trials showed no 
significant between-group differences in the 
rate of surgical-site infection.10-12 Moreover, data 
from observational studies are conflicting.13-15 
The current guidelines on strategies to prevent 
surgical-site infection recommend the use of an 
alcohol-containing preoperative skin-preparatory 
agent, but they note that the most effective disin-
fectant to combine with alcohol is unclear.3
Randomized trials that have predominantly 
involved patients undergoing general surgical 
procedures have suggested the superiority of 
chlorhexidine-based antiseptic agents over io-
dine-based antiseptic agents for the prevention 
of surgical-site infection.16-18 However, most tri-
als compared a chlorhexidine–alcohol combina-
tion with iodine alone, which raises the ques-
tion of whether the apparent superiority of 
chlorhexidine–alcohol is attributable to the 
chlorhexidine, the alcohol, or the combination.19,20 
The unique dual microbial source of pathogens 
from both skin and vaginal origins in surgical-
site infections after cesarean delivery and the 
immune modulation in pregnancy raise ques-
tions about whether the results of trials of 
preoperative skin antisepsis for general surgi-
cal procedures can be extrapolated to cesarean 
delivery.21 Therefore, we designed this prag-
matic randomized, controlled trial to test the 
hypothesis that preoperative skin antisepsis 
with chlorhexidine–alcohol would be superior to 
iodine–alcohol for the prevention of surgical-site 
infection after cesarean delivery.
Methods
Trial Design
Patients were randomly assigned to preoperative 
skin antisepsis with chlorhexidine–alcohol or 
iodine–alcohol in a pragmatic trial to determine 
the comparative effectiveness of the two preop-
erative skin preparations for the prevention of 
surgical-site infection after cesarean delivery. 
We used broad inclusion criteria and routine 
clinical procedures, and we analyzed outcomes 
according to the intention-to-treat principle.22

Patient Selection and Study-Group 
Assignment
All the participants provided written informed 
consent. Pregnant women undergoing cesarean 
delivery at Washington University Medical Center 
in St. Louis from September 2011 through June 
2015 were eligible. We excluded women who had 
known allergy to chlorhexidine, alcohol, iodine, 
or shellfish or who had a skin infection adjacent 
to the operative site.
Once the decision was made to perform a 
cesarean section, enrolled patients underwent 
randomization, in a 1:1 ratio, with the use of a 
computer-generated random sequence produced 
by the study statistician. Patients were assigned to 
receive one of two antiseptic regimens for skin 
preparation: a chlorhexidine–alcohol combination 
(2% chlorhexidine gluconate with 70% isopropyl 
alcohol) or an iodine–alcohol combination (8.3% 
povidone–iodine with 72.5% isopropyl alcohol).
Trial Procedures

ing nurse following the manufacturer’s instruc-

tions, which were similar for the two antiseptic 
agents. In brief, the prepackaged antiseptic ap-
plicator was opened and used to scrub the op-
erative site. A wait time of 3 minutes was al-
lowed between the application of the antiseptic 
agent and skin incision except in emergency 
cases in which this step was skipped. Patients 
also received standard infection-prevention mea-
sures, including body weight–based preoperative 
antibiotic prophylaxis.
Patients were followed daily until discharge 
from the hospital. They were then contacted by 
telephone within 30 days after delivery to assess 
whether they had symptoms of surgical-site in-
fection and inquire whether they had had a 
physician office or emergency department visit 
for wound complications. Medical records were 
obtained from physician office or emergency 
department visits or hospital admissions and 
were reviewed by the principal investigator, who 
was unaware of the study-group assignments, to 
determine the diagnosis at each postoperative 
visit or readmission. We collected demographic 
information, obstetrical and medical history, 
and details of the surgical procedure. Data were 
collected by means of direct interview with the 
patients and were supplemented with data ab-
stracted from the patients’ charts.
Trial Oversight
The study was approved by the institutional re-
view board at the Washington University in St. 
Louis and was overseen by an independent data 
and safety monitoring board. Two interim analy-
ses were conducted, after 50% and 75% of the 
participants were evaluated. The principal inves-
tigator was not informed of the results of the 
interim analyses. The Haybittle–Peto rule was 
used as a guide for stopping the trial early for 
efficacy23,24; it required a P value of less than 
0.001 for the difference between groups to jus-
tify stopping early. This rule has the advantages 
that the exact number and timing of interim 
analyses need not be specified and that the type 
I error at the end of the trial is preserved at 0.05.
Trial Outcomes
The primary outcome was superficial or deep 
surgical-site infection within 30 days after cesar-
ean delivery, on the basis of the National Health-
care Safety Network definitions of the Centers 
for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)25 
(see the Supplementary Appendix, available at 
NEJM.org). The diagnosis was made by the treat-
ing physician and verified by means of chart 
review by the principal investigator, who was 
unaware of the study-group assignments. Pre-
specified secondary outcomes were length of 
hospital stay, physician office visits and hospital 
readmissions for infection-related complications, 
endometritis, positive wound culture, skin irrita-
tion, and allergic reaction. We also assessed, 
post hoc, other wound complications (including 
skin separation, seroma, hematoma, and cel-
lulitis), emergency department visits for wound 
complications, additional wound surgery, use of 
home health services or services of a wound 
clinic, and duration of wound care.
Statistical Analysis
We estimated the sample size for the trial as-
suming a baseline rate of surgical-site infection 
of 8%, on the basis of a prior study conducted 
at our institution,5 and we anticipated a clini-
cally significant 50% lower risk of surgical-site 
infection in the chlorhexidine–alcohol group than 
in the iodine–alcohol group. We estimated that 
the study needed to enroll 1084 participants, 542 
in each group, in order to have 80% power to 
detect a 50% difference in the rates of surgical-
site infection (at a two-tailed alpha level of 0.05). 
To accommodate a 10% loss to follow-up, we 
anticipated enrolling at most 1192 participants.
The primary data analyses followed the inten-
tion-to-treat principle, in which data from all the 
participants were analyzed in the group to 
which the participants were randomly assigned, 
regardless of whether they received the assigned 
intervention.26 Descriptive and univariable statis-
tics were used to characterize the study partici-
pants and to compare the baseline characteris-
tics of the two groups.
We compared the primary outcome and other 
categorical outcomes between groups and calcu-
lated relative risks with 95% confidence inter-
vals. We conducted four prespecified subgroup 
analyses of the primary outcome in subgroups 
defined according to status with respect to ce-
sarean delivery (scheduled vs. unscheduled), 
status with respect to obesity (obese vs. non-
obese), skin-closure type (subcuticular suture vs. 
staple closure), and presence or absence of 
chronic medical conditions (diabetes, chronic 
hypertension, or renal disease). Obesity was de-

fined as a body-mass index (the weight in kilo-
grams divided by the square of the height in 
meters) of 30 or more. We also performed one 
post hoc subgroup analysis involving patients 
with diabetes versus those without diabetes. All 
the patients with diabetes (pregestational or ges-
tational) were considered as a single group. We 
used the Mantel–Haenszel test of homogeneity 
to test for interaction; this test assessed 
whether the relative effectiveness of the anti-
septic agents differed across subgroups. We 
also conducted a prespecified analysis in which 
we included only patients who completed the 
30 days of follow-up.
Two-sided P values of less than 0.05 were con-
sidered to indicate statistical significance. Data 
analysis was conducted with the use of Stata 
software, version 12.1 (StataCorp).
Results
Trial Participants
A total of 1636 pregnant women were screened 
for eligibility; 489 women were excluded from 
the study because they did not meet the inclu-
sion criteria, they declined to participate, or 
study staff were not available to obtain informed 
consent. The remaining 1147 women were ran-
domly assigned to receive preoperative skin 
preparation with either chlorhexidine–alcohol 
(572 women) or iodine–alcohol (575) and were 
included in the primary intention-to-treat analy-
sis (Fig. 1). All the patients except for 14 (7 pa-
tients [1.2%] in each group) received their as-
signed intervention. The most common reason 
in either group that the assigned intervention 
was not received was the discovery after ran-
domization that the participant had an allergy to 
the antiseptic agent. A similar number of par-
ticipants in each group — 34 (5.9%) in the 
chlorhexidine–alcohol group and 31 (5.4%) in 
the iodine–alcohol group — were lost to follow-
up. There were no significant differences be-
tween the two groups in the characteristics at 
baseline (Table 1, and Table S1 in the Supple-
mentary Appendix).
Primary Outcome
A total of 23 patients (4.0%) in the chlorhexi-
dine–alcohol group and 42 (7.3%) in the iodine–
alcohol group received a diagnosis of surgical-
site infection (relative risk, 0.55; 95% confidence 
interval [CI], 0.34 to 0.90; P 
= 
0.02) (Table 2). The 
absolute difference in the rate of surgical-site 
infection between the chlorhexidine–alcohol 
group and the iodine–alcohol group was −3.3 
percentage points (95% CI, −6.0 to −0.6). The 
rate of superficial infection was 3.0% in 
the chlorhexidine–alcohol group and 4.9% in 
the iodine–alcohol group (P 
= 
0.10); the rate of 
deep infection was 1.0% and 2.4%, respectively 
(P 
= 
0.07).
In the subgroup analyses, four prespecified 
and one post hoc, the risks of surgical-site infec-
tion were lower in the chlorhexidine–alcohol 
group than in the iodine–alcohol group in all 
subgroups. The reductions in risk were not ma-
terially affected by whether cesarean delivery 
was scheduled versus unscheduled, by the pres-
ence or absence of obesity, by the type of skin

closure, by the presence or absence of chronic 
medical conditions, or by status with respect to 
diabetes (Fig. 2).
A total of 1082 patients (94.3%) completed the 
30 days of follow-up (538 patients in the chlorhex-
idine–alcohol group and 544 in the iodine–alco-
hol group). Among the patients with complete 
follow-up, the rate of surgical-site infection was 
significantly lower among those who had preop-
erative skin preparation with chlorhexidine–alco-
hol than among those who had preoperative skin 
preparation with iodine–alcohol (4.3% vs. 7.7%; 
relative risk, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.34 to 0.91; P 
= 
0.02) 
(Table S2 in the Supplementary Appendix).
Secondary Outcomes
Key Secondary Outcomes
There were no significant differences between 
patients who were randomly assigned to the 
chlorhexidine–alcohol group and those random-
ly assigned to the iodine–alcohol group with 
respect to rates of endometritis, hospital read-
mission for infection-related complications, or 
length of hospital stay (Table 2). Patients as-
signed to the chlorhexidine–alcohol group were 
significantly less likely than those assigned to 
the iodine–alcohol group to have physician of-
fice visits for wound concerns (7.9% vs. 12.5%; 
relative risk, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.44 to 0.90; P 
= 
0.009).
Wound Cultures
Specimens for culture were obtained from 32 of 
the 65 patients with surgical-site infection, and 
in 27 of these 32 patients (84%) the cultures 
were positive for bacterial growth. A total of 14 
of 27 positive cultures (52%) were polymicro-
bial. There was no significant difference in the 
rate of positive bacterial growth between patients 
assigned to chlorhexidine–alcohol and those as-
signed to iodine–alcohol (6 of 8 patients [75%]) 
and 21 of 24 [88%], respectively; P 
= 
0.58). 
Staphylococcus aureus was the most common iso-
late (in 10 of 27 patients [37%]). Methicillin-
resistant S. aureus was present in 1 of 8 cultures 
(12%) in the chlorhexidine–alcohol group and 
in 4 of 24 (17%) in the iodine–alcohol group 
(P 
= 
0.10).
Adverse Skin Reactions
Overall, the rates of adverse skin reactions were 
low. Erythema at the operative site was the most 
common skin reaction, and the rate did not differ 
significantly between the chlorhexidine–alcohol 
group and the iodine–alcohol group (2.3% and 
1.9%, respectively; P 
= 
0.67). The rates of skin 
irritation and allergic skin reactions also did 
not differ significantly between the two groups 
(Table 2).

Additional Outcomes
In a post hoc analysis, the use of other health 
care services (including emergency depart-
ment visits, additional wound surgery, and use 
of home health services or the services of a 
wound clinic) did not differ significantly be-
tween the chlorhexidine–alcohol group and 
the iodine–alcohol group (Table S3 in the Sup-
plementary Appendix). Skin separation was the 
most common wound complication (assessed 
post hoc) and occurred in 11.5% of the patients 
in each group (P 
= 
0.97). The groups also did 
not differ significantly with respect to the rates 
of other wound complications (including sero-
ma, hematoma, and cellulitis). The median dura-
tion of wound care did not differ significantly 
between the two groups (5 weeks in each group, 
P 
= 
0.55). There were no cases of fire or chemical 
skin burn in either group.
Discussion
In this randomized, controlled trial, we found 
that the risk of surgical-site infection after ce-
sarean delivery was significantly lower when 
chlorhexidine–alcohol was used for preoperative 
skin preparation than when iodine–alcohol was 
used. The rates of surgical-site infection were 
low overall, and the absolute difference between 
groups was relatively modest.
In addition, patients who were assigned to 
chlorhexidine–alcohol were significantly less 
likely than those who were assigned to iodine–
alcohol to have physician office visits for wound

Skin Antiseptic Agents at Cesarean Delivery
complications. The length of hospital stay and 
the rates of hospital readmission for infection-
related complications, endometritis, and adverse 
skin reactions were similar in the two groups, as 
were the rates of other wound complications.
The results of this trial can be compared only 
with trials involving nonobstetrical patients, 
because none of the three small randomized 
trials comparing antiseptic agents for the pre-
vention of surgical-site infection after cesarean 
delivery compared chlorhexidine–alcohol with 
iodine–alcohol.10-12 One trial involving 79 women 
that compared alcohol scrub and iodophor 
drape with iodophor scrub only showed no 
wound infection in either group.10 Another trial 
involving 50 women compared parachlorometa-
xylenol plus iodine with iodine alone and showed 
no significant difference in the risk of wound 
infection.11 A recent trial that was designed pri-
marily to test the effects of antiseptic agents on 
skin culture randomly assigned 60 women to 
chlorhexidine gluconate or povidone–iodine and 
showed no significant difference in surgical-site 
infection.12
Several studies involving patients undergoing 
general surgical procedures have shown the su-
periority of chlorhexidine–alcohol over povidone–
iodine for the prevention of surgical-site infec-
tion. A multicenter, randomized trial comparing 
these agents in adults undergoing clean-contam-
inated surgery (defined by the investigators as 
colorectal, small intestinal, gastroesophageal, 
biliary, thoracic, gynecologic, or urologic opera-
tions performed under controlled conditions 
without substantial spillage or unusual contami-
nation) showed a significantly lower risk of surgi-
cal-site infection with chlorhexidine–alcohol than 
with povidone–iodine (9.5% vs. 16.1%; relative 
risk, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.41 to 0.85; P 
= 
0.004)17; risks 
were lower with chlorhexidine–alcohol for super-

The analyses were performed according to the intention-to-treat principle. Four subgroup analyses were prespeci-
fied: scheduled versus unscheduled cesarean delivery, obese (body-mass index [the weight in kilograms divided by 
the square of the height in meters], ≥30) versus nonobese, subcuticular suture versus staple closure, and presence 
versus absence of chronic medical condition (diabetes, chronic hypertension, or renal disease). One subgroup analysis 
was post hoc (diabetes vs. no diabetes). Estimates for the relative effect of chlorhexidine–alcohol versus iodine–alco-
hol on the risk of surgical-site infection in each subgroup are presented as relative risks with 95% confidence inter-
vals. P values for interaction are from the Mantel–Haenszel test of homogeneity. Data on the skin-closure type were 
missing for one patient in the iodine–alcohol group. The arrow indicates that the lower limit of the 95% confidence 
interval is less than 0.2.

ficial and deep incisional infections but not for 
organ or space infections.17 A subsequent meta-
analysis that included this trial and five other 
trials showed a significantly lower risk of surgi-
cal-site infection with chlorhexidine-based anti-
septics than with iodine-based antiseptics.16 Al-
though these data suggested the superiority of 
chlorhexidine-based antiseptics, it remained un-
clear whether the superiority was attributable to 
the chlorhexidine, the alcohol, or the combina-
tion and whether these results would apply to 
cesarean delivery.
Our results are consistent with those of the 
prior studies that suggested the superiority of 
chlorhexidine-based antiseptics over iodine-
based antiseptics for the prevention of surgical-
site infection. However, our findings differ from 
the results of a large, nonrandomized, sequen-
tial-implementation study that showed a lower 
rate of surgical-site infection with iodine–alco-
hol than with chlorhexidine–alcohol.27 The rea-
sons for the different findings in that trial are 
unclear, but differences in the types of surgical 
procedures and potential confounding by un-
measured variables are plausible explanations.
Chlorhexidine has a number of properties 
that may lead to greater effectiveness than io-
dine as an antiseptic. It has strong affinity for 
binding to skin, high antibacterial activity 
against gram-positive and gram-negative bacte-
ria including methicillin-resistant S. aureus, and 
longer residual effects than are observed with 
iodine.28,29 Unlike iodine, chlorhexidine is not 
inactivated by organic matter such as bodily 
fluids and does not require a wait time between 
application and surgical incision. However, 
chlorhexidine is more expensive than iodine 
and has been linked to allergic reactions.16,29 We 
found no differences in the rates of pruritus or 
allergic reactions between patients randomly 
assigned to chlorhexidine–alcohol and those 
assigned to iodine–alcohol, a finding that is 
consistent with the results of a prior trial.17
This trial has several limitations. First, we 
conducted the trial at a single site, which raises 
a question about the potential generalizability of 
our findings. However, the study population was 
racially and socioeconomically diverse; 55% of 
the participants were black, and 62% had public 
insurance. The obstetrical providers were also 
diverse (academic specialists and subspecialists, 
private physicians, and resident physicians), and 
we included scheduled as well as unscheduled 
cesarean deliveries. Subgroup analyses suggested 
a consistent superiority of chlorhexidine–alcohol 
across subgroups, which increases the general-
izability of our findings.
Second, the lack of blinding among the par-
ticipants and providers could potentially have 
introduced bias. However, any such bias would 
be expected to be nondirectional. Furthermore, 
we used similar standard skin-preparation pro-
cedures for the patients in the two groups. We 
used active surveillance, including telephone 
calls, to minimize loss to follow-up and to 
track the incidence of surgical-site infection; 
this point is important because most infections 
after cesarean delivery occur after discharge 
from the hospital.6 We reviewed medical re-
cords in a blinded fashion to verify the primary 
outcome and used the CDC National Health-
care Safety Network definitions to ensure ob-
jective ascertainment.25
In conclusion, this randomized, controlled trial 
showed that the use of chlorhexidine–alcohol for 
preoperative skin antisepsis at cesarean deliv-
ery was associated with a significantly lower 
risk of surgical-site infection than was the use 
of iodine–alcohol.
