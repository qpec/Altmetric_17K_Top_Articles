Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis, collectively known as 
inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), are characterized by chronic 
inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract (1). IBD has been 
associated with poor quality of life and extensive morbidity 
and often results in complications requiring hospitalizations 
and surgical procedures (2–4). Most previous studies of IBD 
have used administrative claims data or data collected from 
limited geographic areas to demonstrate increases in estimated 
prevalence of IBD within the United States (5,6). Few national 
prevalence estimates of IBD among adults based on large, 
nationally representative data sources exist, and those that do 
tend to be based on older data. For example, the most recent 
national study used 1999 National Health Interview Survey 
(NHIS) data and estimated that 1.8 million (0.9%) U.S. 
adults had IBD (7). To examine the prevalence of IBD among 
the civilian, noninstitutionalized U.S. adult population, data 
from the 2015 NHIS were analyzed. Overall, an estimated 
3.1 million, or 1.3%, of U.S. adults have received a diagnosis 
of IBD. Within population subgroups, a higher prevalence of 
IBD was identified among adults aged ≥45 years, Hispanics, 
non-Hispanic whites, and adults with less than a high school 
level of education, not currently employed, born in the United 
States, living in poverty, or living in suburban areas. The use 
of a nationally representative data source such as the NHIS 
to estimate the prevalence of IBD overall and by population 
subgroups is important to understand the burden of IBD on 
the U.S. health care system.
NHIS is a household survey that provides nationally repre-
sentative estimates on a broad range of health measures for the 
civilian, noninstitutionalized population. Data on IBD were 
collected in the Sample Adult Core component of the survey. 
In this component, the respondent (i.e., the sample adult) is 
randomly selected from among all adults aged ≥18 years in 
the family. A proxy respondent might respond for the sample 
adult if, because of health reasons, the sample adult is physi-
cally or mentally unable to respond themselves.* Respondents 
were identified as having a diagnosis of IBD if they responded 
affirmatively to the question, “Have you ever been told by 
a doctor or other health professional that you had Crohn’s 
disease or ulcerative colitis?” The 2015 NHIS Sample Adult 
Core consisted of 33,672 adults and had a final response rate 
of 55.2%. Sociodemographic characteristics were collected in 
the NHIS Household Module and Family Core components 
of the survey.
The number of IBD cases and prevalence of IBD (with 
accompanying 95% confidence intervals) were estimated for 
the civilian, noninstitutionalized U.S. adult population overall 
and by various sociodemographic characteristics, including 
sex, age, race/ethnicity, education level, marital status, current 
employment status, nativity, health insurance coverage type 
(reported separately for adults aged <65 years and ≥65 years), 
poverty status (calculated using NHIS imputed income files), 
urbanicity, and region of residence. Comparisons among sub-
groups used age-adjusted estimates of IBD prevalence, which 
were calculated using the projected 2000 U.S. population as 
the standard population and four age groups: 18–24 years, 
25–44 years, 45–64 years, and ≥65 years. All estimates meet 
the standards of reliability,† unless otherwise noted. Sampling 
weights were used for all estimates, and the complex sample 
design of the NHIS was accounted for by using SUDAAN 
11.0 software for the analysis. For comparisons of prevalence 
between subgroups, statistical significance (p<0.05) was deter-
mined by two-tailed Z-tests. All reported differences between 
subgroups were statistically significant.
In 2015, an estimated 1.3% (1.2% age-adjusted) of U.S. 
adults (3.1 million) had ever received a diagnosis of IBD 
(Table). A higher percentage of adults aged 45–64 (1.5%) and 
≥65 (1.7%) years had IBD compared with adults aged 18–24 
(0.5%) and 25–44 (1.0%) years. Hispanics (1.2%) and 
non-Hispanic whites (1.4%) had a higher prevalence of IBD 
than did non-Hispanic blacks (0.5%). Adults with less than 
a high school level of education had a higher prevalence of 
IBD (1.7%) than did those with a bachelor’s degree or higher 
(1.1%). Among adults not currently employed, 1.6% had ever 
received a diagnosis of IBD, compared with 1.2% of adults who 
were currently employed. Adults who were born in the United 
States had a higher prevalence of IBD (1.4%) than did adults 
who were not born in the United States (0.8%). Adults living 
in poverty (from families with incomes <100% of the federal

(i.e., responses coded as “refused,” “don’t know,” or “not ascertained”) with 
respect to IBD status are not shown separately in the table or included in the

standard population and four age groups: 18–24, 25–44, 45–64, and ≥65 years.
 ¶ Estimates are considered unreliable according to the standards of reliability. 
Estimates with a relative standard error (RSE) >30.0% and ≤50.0% are still shown, 
but should be used with caution. Estimates not shown have an RSE >50.0%.

Native only; non-Hispanic Asian only; non-Hispanic Native Hawaiian and 
Pacific Islander only; and non-Hispanic multiple race.
 †† Based on a hierarchy of mutually exclusive categories. Adults with more than 
one type of health insurance were assigned to the first appropriate category 
in the hierarchy. “Uninsured” includes adults who had no coverage and those 
who had only Indian Health Service coverage or had only a private plan that 
paid for one type of service, such as accidents or dental care.
 
§§ In the survey sample, there were zero adults aged ≥65 years and uninsured 
who had ever been told by a doctor or other health professional that they 
had Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis.
§ Federal poverty levels are updated annually by the U.S. Census Bureau (https://
aspe.hhs.gov/2015-poverty-guidelines). Percentage of poverty relative to the 
federal poverty level is used to define poverty status, and is calculated, using 
NHIS imputed income files, as total family income divided by the family’s 
corresponding federal poverty level, and multiplied by 100.
¶ A metropolitan statistical area (MSA) is defined as a county or group of 
contiguous counties that contain at least one urbanized area of 50,000 
population or more. Adults were defined as living in the central or principal 
city of an MSA (MSA, central city), in an MSA but not in the central city 
(MSA, noncentral city), or not in a MSA. “Not in a MSA” indicates that the 
adults lives in a nonmetropolitan area, defined as an area that does not include 
a large urbanized area; these areas are generally thought of as more rural.

Discussion
Approximately 3 million U.S. adults are estimated to have 
ever received a diagnosis of IBD, a disease that is associated with 
decreased quality of life, substantial morbidity, and complica-
tions requiring hospitalizations and surgical procedures (2–4). 
This is almost three times the number of adults previously 
estimated to have IBD based on administrative data sources 
and limited geographic coverage (6,8,9).
Differences in IBD prevalence among a number of sociode-
mographic subgroups reveal that prevalence is not uniform 
across the U.S. adult population. Consistent with past research 
that found the prevalence of both Crohn’s disease and ulcer-
ative colitis increase with age (8), a higher prevalence of IBD 
was found among adults aged ≥45 years in this nationally 
representative population. Furthermore, a significantly higher 
prevalence of IBD among non-Hispanic whites was found, 
consistent with racial/ethnic differences previously reported 
using 1999 NHIS data (7). However, other results differed 
from previous reports. For example, although the current study 
found no significant differences in the prevalence of IBD by 
health insurance coverage type among adults aged <65 years 
or ≥65 years, previous analyses using claims data found that 
commercially insured persons had a higher prevalence of IBD 
than did persons insured by Medicaid (5). Furthermore, sig-
nificant regional (5,7,8) and sex (7,8) differences identified in 
past research were not found in this study. Finally, significant 
differences among sociodemographic characteristics such as 
education level, employment status, nativity, and poverty status 
were identified in this study, but not elsewhere. Other research-
ers have speculated that subgroup differences likely exist for 
many of the same measures, but small sample sizes and less 
heterogeneous populations have limited their ability to produce 
stable, reliable estimates (9). Inconsistencies in findings might 
also be attributable to differences in data collection methods 
(e.g., survey data versus claims data) and geographic coverage 
(e.g., county level versus national level).
The findings in this report are subject to at least five limi-
tations. First, only diagnosed Crohn’s disease and ulcerative 
colitis cases were included; data for undiagnosed conditions 
are not collected by the NHIS. Second, because the majority 
of data from the NHIS Sample Adult Core component are self-
reported and not corroborated with medical records, a potential 
for recall bias might exist. Third, the NHIS sample design does 
not include adults in long-term care facilities; these persons 
were excluded from the study. Active duty military personnel 
and incarcerated persons were also excluded. This limits the 
generalizability of the results to the civilian, noninstitutional-
ized population. Fourth, most IBD prevalence estimates met 
the standards of reliability; however, for widowed adults and 
adults aged 18–24 years, these standards were not met. Finally, 
although survey weights were adjusted after data collection 
to ensure national generalizability, the 2015 NHIS Sample 
Adult Core’s response rate (55.2%) signals the potential for 
nonresponse bias in the IBD estimates.
Previous research indicates the burden of IBD to be extensive, 
including decreased health-related quality of life (2), high 
hospitalization rates (8.2–17.1 per 100,000 persons with IBD 
annually) (3), and direct treatment costs estimated to exceed 
6.8 billion dollars in 2008 (10). Understanding the prevalence 
of IBD in the United States is important to both identify the 
health and financial burdens created by this disease and to 
inform policy and resource allocation (5). Examination of 
2015 NHIS data indicates that the prevalence of IBD among 
adults has increased and far exceeds estimates based on non–
nationally representative data sources. Using the NHIS to 
monitor the prevalence of IBD among U.S. adults can enhance 
understanding of the health and financial burdens IBD places 
on the U.S. health care system and help identify subgroups with 
higher prevalence rates who might be most in need of resources 
to manage and treat this potentially fatal chronic disease (7).
Summary
What is already known about this topic?
Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis, collectively known as 
inflammatory bowel disease, are characterized by chronic 
inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract. Inflammatory bowel 
disease has been associated with decreased quality of life and 
extensive morbidity and often results in complications requiring 
hospitalizations and surgical procedures. In 1999, an estimated 
1.8 million (0.9%) U.S. adults had inflammatory bowel disease.
What is added by this report?
In 2015, an estimated 3.1 million (1.3%) of U.S. adults had ever 
received a diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease, and 
prevalence differed significantly among a number of sociode-
mographic characteristics, including age, race/ethnicity, 
education level, employment status, nativity, poverty status, 
and urbanicity. This study is one of the few times that inflamma-
tory bowel disease prevalence estimates among U.S. adults 
have been assessed for a wide range of respondent characteris-
tics using a large, nationally representative data source.
What are the implications for public health practice?
The use of a nationally representative data source such as the 
National Health Interview Survey to estimate the prevalence of 
inflammatory bowel disease among U.S. adults is important to 
understanding the burden this disease currently places on the 
U.S. health care system. Highlighting population subgroups 
with higher prevalence rates of inflammatory bowel disease can 
enable a better understanding of the disease and the popula-
tions most affected.
