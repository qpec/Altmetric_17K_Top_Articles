Viruses have long been considered potential triggers of autoimmune
diseases. Here we defined the intestinal virome from birth to the
development of autoimmunity in children at risk for type 1 diabetes
(T1D). A total of 220 virus-enriched preparations from serially collected
fecal samples from 11 children (cases) who developed serum autoan-
tibodies associated with T1D (of whom five developed clinical T1D)
were compared with samples from controls. Intestinal viromes of case
subjects were less diverse than those of controls. Among eukaryotic
viruses, we identified significant enrichment of Circoviridae-related
sequences in samples from controls in comparison with cases. Entero-
virus, kobuvirus, parechovirus, parvovirus, and rotavirus sequences
were frequently detected but were not associated with autoimmu-
nity. For bacteriophages, we found higher Shannon diversity and rich-
ness in controls compared with cases and observed that changes in
the intestinal virome over time differed between cases and controls.
Using Random Forests analysis, we identified disease-associated viral
bacteriophage contigs after subtraction of age-associated contigs.
These disease-associated contigs were statistically linked to specific
components of the bacterial microbiome. Thus, changes in the intes-
tinal virome preceded autoimmunity in this cohort. Specific compo-
nents of the virome were both directly and inversely associated with
the development of human autoimmune disease.
virome | microbiome | Circoviridae | type 1 diabetes | bacteriophages
T
he microbiome contains multiple types of organisms, including
bacteria, archaea, fungi, and eukaryotic organisms, as well as
the viruses that infect both the host and other members of the
microbiome (1). Changes in various components of the micro-
biome have been observed in association with multiple human
diseases (1–4). Prominent among diseases that are influenced by
microorganisms is type 1 diabetes (T1D), a disease involving an
autoimmune attack on the insulin-secreting beta cells of the pan-
creatic islets of Langerhans. Changes in intestinal bacteria have
been linked to the development of T1D in some studies (5, 6).
Some common observations include increased abundance of the
Bacteroides genus (7–9) and reduced abundance of butyrate-
producing bacteria (7, 10). In a study that included 11 seroposi-
tive children from Finland and Estonia, of whom 4 progressed to
T1D, Kostic et al. demonstrated a reduction in bacterial diversity
among the cases (11). These changes emerged after the appearance
of autoantibodies that are predictive of T1D (11), potentially sug-
gesting that intestinal bacteria might be involved in the progression
from beta-cell autoimmunity to clinical disease rather than in the
initiation of the disease process (6).
Changes in intestinal viruses have been observed in patients with
inflammatory bowel disease and AIDS (2–4, 12), indicating that
changes in the virome can be associated with infectious and in-
flammatory diseases. In some cases, these changes involve eukaryotic
viruses, whereas in other cases, disease-associated changes in
bacteriophages have been identified. Studies in mice clearly doc-
ument that virus infection can trigger damage to the islets (13–16).
Furthermore, intestinal eukaryotic viruses have been implicated in
triggering human T1D, based mostly on seroepidemiologic studies
of responses to one or a few candidate viruses (17–19). However,
in another study, no changes in the virome were detected for
3–9 mo before the development of autoimmunity (20). In a recent
study, CrAssphage, a human bacteriophage, was correlated with
Bacteroides dorei, but a direct association of this virus with islet
autoimmunity was not observed (21). Importantly, although it
generally has been assumed that viruses cause harm by triggering
diseases, studies in animal models show that virus infection is not
necessarily harmful and can provide symbiotic benefits (22–24),
and actually may offer protection from the development of T1D
(25, 26). Thus, an evaluation of the virome in children at risk for
T1D might have the potential to identify viruses associated with
either disease risk or protection from disease. In this study, we
defined the RNA and DNA intestinal virome of children before
the development of autoimmunity and identified changes in the
virome potentially associated with protection against or develop-
ment of this human autoimmune disease.
Significance
Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is a major autoimmune disease with in-
creasing incidence in recent years. In this study, we found that the
intestinal viromes of cases were less diverse than those of con-
trols. We identified eukaryotic viruses and bacteriophage contigs
that are associated with the presence or absence of autoimmu-
nity. These viruses provide targets for future mechanistic studies
to differentiate causal and incidental associations between the
virome and protection against the development of T1D.

 Results
Cohort and Sample Sequencing. To characterize the intestinal virome
and its relationship to T1D disease susceptibility, we studied se-
quential fecal samples from a well-characterized prospective lon-
gitudinal study of infants at risk for T1D (11). Infants from Finland
and Estonia were recruited at birth based on their HLA risk ge-
notype. Parents collected infant stools at approximately monthly
intervals. The cohort included 11 children who developed serum
autoantibodies associated with progression to T1D (defined as
positivity for at least two of the five autoantibodies analyzed, re-
ferred to as “cases” herein) (11). Of these 11 cases of autoimmu-
nity, 4 developed T1D before the initial publication of the cohort
and 1 progressed to T1D at age 77 mo. Therefore, this study in-
volved an analysis of sequential stool samples collected before
development of autoimmunity in 11 children. Six of these 11 chil-
dren exhibited autoantibodies without progression to T1D (the
“seroconverter” group), and the other five seroconverted and de-
veloped T1D (the “T1D” group) (Fig. 1). These 11 cases were
matched with 11 controls for sex, HLA genotype, age, delivery
route, and country (Table 1) (11).
To define longitudinal changes in the intestinal virome, we
prepared libraries from DNA and RNA isolated from virus-like
particle (VLP) preparations from all fecal samples collected before
seroconversion and control samples. Samples were matched for
collection time as closely as possible (Fig. 1). Shotgun sequencing
was carried out on 220 samples, with a median of 11 samples per
individual (range, 5–17) using the paired-end 2 × 250 nt Illumina
MiSeq platform (3). We obtained a mean of 1.93 ± 0.92 million
sequences per sample, of which a mean of 68.5% ± 14.3% were of
high quality (Dataset S1). Deduplicated sequences were analyzed
using VirusSeeker (27) to detect bacteriophage and eukaryotic
viral sequences, which accounted for 0.04–93.17% of deduplicated
sequences. There were no significant differences in the total num-
ber of sequences, the number of quality-controlled unique sequences,
or the percentage of eukaryotic viral sequences between cases and
controls. However, controls had a significantly higher percentage
of bacteriophage sequences (P = 0.017, repeated measures
ANOVA with permutation test).
Intestinal Virome in Children at Risk for T1D. We used two comple-
mentary approaches to compare intestinal viromes between cases
and controls. First, we used read-based analysis to detect bacte-
riophage and eukaryotic viral sequences based on the best BLAST
hit when queried against National Center for Biotechnology In-
formation (NCBI) nucleotide (NT) and protein (NR) databases
(27). Viral abundances were normalized to total deduplicated se-
quences (referred to as “relative abundance” herein) from each
sample and used for statistical comparison of viromes.
Because viruses are the fastest-mutating genetic elements on
Earth (23), and limitations in the reference viral databases result in
the inability to annotate the great majority of sequences present in
purified “virus” samples (28, 29), we also performed contig-based
analysis. Sequences from each sample were individually assembled
to minimize the possibility of chimeric sequence formation (27). The
taxonomic identity of each contig was assigned based on the best
BLAST hit when queried against the NCBI NT and NR databases
(27). Contigs obtained from all samples were pooled, resulting in
10,715 contigs ≥1,000 bp in length, of which 6,550 unique contigs
were obtained after deduplication. In total, 3,666 contigs were
classified as viral contigs. The longest contig was 108,785 bp, which
shared the greatest sequence similarity to bacillus phage BCU4 in
the Myoviridae with a genome of 154,371 bp. If the 5′ and 3′ ends of
a contig overlapped by at least 10 bases with ≥99% nucleotide
identity, then the overlapping sequences were trimmed, and the
contig was considered a circular full-length genome. A total of
422 potential complete circular genomes were obtained. The longest
of these had a length of 99,507 bp after trimming and shared the
highest sequence similarity with Staphylococcus phage pSco-10 in the
Siphoviridae with a genome of 101,986 nt. The results suggest that
our VLP preparation and sequencing enabled us to obtain abundant
viral sequences and complete viral genomes in the stool samples.
A reference contig database was created consisting of the
6,550 unique contigs, the four full-length CRESS DNA virus (cir-
cular, rep-encoding single-stranded DNA virus) (30, 31) genomes
obtained (see below), and crAssphage (32), a prevalent bacterio-
phage whose full-length genome was not in the version of the
NCBI database downloaded. Deduplicated individual sequencing
reads from each sample were aligned to the contig database using
FR-HIT (33). A mean of 93.2 ± 13.0% of the deduplicated se-
quences per sample were mapped to these contigs (sequence
identity ≥95% over the length of an individual sequence). A nor-
malized matrix of the number of reads per kbp of contig sequence
per million raw reads per sample (RPKM) of all the viral contigs
was used to create a viral contig abundance matrix. This viral contig
abundance matrix was used to measure α and β diversity of the
virome (34) and to perform Random Forests analysis.
We detected 178 genera (145 genera of bacteriophage and
33 genera of eukaryotic virus) out of the 609 total viral genera
defined by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses
(2015 release). Nearly full-length genomes were obtained for viruses
related to six eukaryotic viral families: Anelloviridae, Circoviridae,
Bocaviridae, Picobirnaviridae, Picornaviridae, and Reoviridae
(Dataset S2). Nine nearly full-length picornavirus genomes with
high sequence identity to human parechovirus and human cox-
sackievirus A4 genomes were identified in seven different subjects
(Dataset S2). In subject case 3 (E006574), nearly full-length se-
quences of 10 of the 11 dsRNA segments of a rotavirus genome
most closely related to rotavirus A were obtained (Dataset S2).
Although the presence of these sequences does not prove infection

 with the viruses detected, the children were exposed to a broad
range of eukaryotic viruses (12, 23).
We measured virome β diversity using the Hellinger distance
metric on the RPKM matrix (34). Distances were computed
between fecal viromes sampled from a given individual over
time (intrapersonal variation). Additional comparisons were
made between individuals (interpersonal variation). The greatest
similarity between fecal viromes was within an individual over
time, as reported previously (34). The intrapersonal variation
for both controls and cases was significantly (adjusted P <
0.0001) lower than the interpersonal variation within these two
groups (Fig. 2A), and there was no significant difference in this
measure between the two groups. However, the interpersonal
variation between cases was significantly lower than that of
controls (adjusted P < 0.0001), indicating that the virome of
cases as a group was less diverse than that of the controls as a
group (Fig. 2A).
Changes in the Eukaryotic Virome Suggest Protective Effects Against
Autoimmunity. We next analyzed the relationships between se-
quences from specific types of viruses and the development of
autoimmunity. We first compared the relative abundance of each
eukaryotic virus taxon between controls and cases using repeated
measures ANOVA with permutation test (Table 2). We found a
higher relative abundance of sequences associated with Circo-
viridae in control subjects compared with cases (P = 0.026)
(Table 2 and Fig. 2B). When we compared the relative abun-
dance of these sequences in control subjects with 6 seroconverter
subjects and 5 T1D subjects as separate subgroups, the differ-
ences failed to reach significance (Table 2), perhaps owing to small
sample size. Importantly, Circoviridae-related sequences were

 detected only in the control subjects (5 of 11; 45.5%) but not cases
(0 of 11; P = 0.035, Fisher’s exact test) (Fig. 2B). However, not all
control subjects exhibited Circoviridae-related sequences, and so
the association with the absence of development of autoim-
munity was not absolute. Circoviridae-related sequences were
detected in multiple samples from two subjects who appeared
chronically infected. Both the repeated measures ANOVA with
permutation test, which accounts for the dependency of samples
within a subject, and Fisher’s exact test by subject detected a sig-
nificant
association
between
Circoviridae-related
sequences
and controls.
To further define the Circoviridae-related sequences in control
subjects, we performed multiple displacement amplification (MDA)
of the fecal samples in which these sequences were detected, fol-
lowed by next-generation sequencing. Sequence assembly revealed
six full-length circular genomes. Four of these genomes encoded a
replication-associated protein (Rep) and are referred as rep-
encoding single-stranded DNA virus (CRESS DNA virus 1–4)
according to the current nomenclature (30) (Dataset S2). The
other two genomes did not encode an apparent Rep protein.
Without the ability to culture these viruses and resequence, we
were concerned that they might be an artifact from MDA and did
not analyze them further. Overlapping PCR amplification and
Sanger sequencing confirmed the full-length circular genomes of
CRESS DNA viruses 1–4. These genomes shared 86.8–92.3%
nucleotide identity. The novel CRESS DNA viruses were most
closely related to porcine circo-like viruses 21 and 22 (CRESS
DNA virus 1 and 2 shared 37–44% amino acid sequence identity),
bat circovirus (CRESS DNA virus 3 shared 36% amino acid
identity), and Farfantepenaeus duorarum circovirus (CRESS DNA
virus 4 shared 34% amino acid sequence identity) (Dataset S2).
Further analysis revealed three different genome structures for the
CRESS DNA viruses. Viruses 1 and 2 had genomes of ∼3.9 kb and
encoded 5 ORFs (Fig. S1). Both the genome size and the number
as well as the organization of encoded ORFs were similar to those
of the viruses of recently proposed Kirkoviridae (35); however, in
contrast to viruses in this proposed family, ORF5 was in the same
orientation as the Rep-encoding ORF in CRESS DNA viruses
1 and 2. Virus 3 had a genome size (1.9 kb) similar to the Circo-
viridae; however, the two ORFs encoded by this virus were in the
same direction (Fig. S1) instead of in opposite directions as ob-
served for the Circoviridae (31). Virus 4 was similar to circoviruses
(30, 31) in terms of both genome size (2.3 kb) and genome
structure (Fig. S1). Overall, the low level of similarity to even the
most closely related circoviruses strongly suggests that these viruses
are novel.
We next compared the abundance of each of the CRESS DNA
viruses between cases and controls using a contig-based method.
Using repeated measures ANOVA with permutation test, we
detected a significantly higher abundance of CRESS DNA virus
1 in control subjects compared with cases (P = 0.008).
Eukaryotic Viruses Not Associated with Risk of Autoimmunity. Studies
of eukaryotic viruses in T1D have suggested predisposing and
disease-triggering effects. Such effects have been suggested
for viruses in the Enterovirus and Parechovirus genera of the
Picornaviridae (36–38), cytomegalovirus (39), mumps virus (40),
parvovirus (41), rubella (42, 43), and rotavirus (44). Although we
did not observe any sequences originating from cytomegalovirus,
rubella virus, or mumps virus, we detected a high prevalence of
Picornaviridae sequences, including sequences of enteroviruses,
kobuviruses, and parechoviruses (Fig. S2 E, F, G, and H). We
assembled eight nearly full-length genomic sequences of human
parechoviruses and one virus most closely related to human cox-
sackievirus A4 (Dataset S2). At the family level, Picornaviridae
sequences were detected in the majority of subjects, and there was
no statistically significant difference in the abundance or prevalence
of Picornaviridae sequences between cases and controls (Table 2

abundance or prevalence were detected between cases and controls

Parvovirus B19 in the Erythroparvovirus genus is reportedly as-

bocavirus in multiple subjects and at different time points (Fig.
S2C). Three nearly full-length genomes were obtained from case 3
(human bocavirus 3), case 11 (human bocavirus 2), and control 11
(human bocavirus 3) (Dataset S2). The contigs obtained from case
3 and control 11 were 99.8% identical over 5,261 nt at the nucleotide
level. No significant difference in relative abundance or prevalence
was detected between cases and controls (Table 2). Rotavirus has
been identified as a candidate trigger or exacerbating factor for T1D
(44, 45). We detected rotavirus in multiple subjects, including three
cases and six controls (Fig. S2D), but found no difference in relative
abundance or prevalence between cases and controls (Table 2).
Anelloviridae sequences were present in nearly every subject (Fig.
S2A). There were no statistically significant differences in the rela-
tive abundance and prevalence of Anelloviridae sequences between
cases and controls (Table 2).
Changes in Bacteriophages Associated with Development of Auto-
immunity. We observed no differences between cases and con-
trols in the relative abundance for Microviridae, Myoviridae,
Podoviridae, and Siphoviridae using read-based analysis. However,
populations of bacteriophages differed significantly between cases
and controls by a number of measures. Controls exhibited signif-
icantly higher Shannon diversity for the Podoviridae than cases (P =
0.011; Fig. 3 E and G). In addition, the change of Shannon diversity
over time differed between controls and cases, especially for Myo-
viridae (P = 0.003; Fig. 3 C and G), but also in Microviridae (P =
0.033; Fig. 3 A and G) and Podoviridae (P = 0.075; Fig. 3 E and G).
Controls exhibited higher richness than cases for the Myoviridae
(P = 0.019; Fig. 3 D and G). Controls and cases had similar
levels of richness at younger ages, but the differences between
cases and controls increased with increasing age. Interestingly,
in controls, bacteriophage richness increased consistently over
time, and controls generally exhibited higher richness than
cases for all three bacteriophage families for all age groups.
Importantly, the changes in richness over time differed between
controls and cases, especially for Myoviridae (P = 0.007; Fig. 3
D and G), but also in Microviridae (P = 0.033; Fig. 3 B and G)
and Podoviridae (P = 0.073; Fig. 3 F and G).
Overall, these data indicate that bacteriophage populations
differed between cases and controls. Interestingly, these differ-
ences were observed even though analysis of bacterial populations
in the same samples failed to reveal a bacterial signature associ-
ated with seroconversion (11).
Age-Discriminatory Viral Contigs. To identify bacteriophage contigs
associated with autoimmunity, we first identified age-discriminative
contigs to remove them as a confounding factor. Age affects
virome composition during the first 3 y of life (34, 46). Consistent
with this, we observed a significant correlation between age and the
relative abundance of specific bacteriophages and Shannon di-
versity, as well as richness, using both reads-based methods and
contig-based methods (Table S1).

(A and B), Myoviridae (C and D), and Podoviridae (E and F) were compared between cases (n = 11) and controls (n = 11). Siphoviridae were not significantly
different between cases and controls and thus are not shown. Viral abundance was measured by the RPKM abundance matrix. Differences between groups were
considered statistically significant at P ≤ 0.05 using repeated measures ANOVA with permutation test. (G) Comparison of Shannon diversity and richness of

 To identify viral contigs whose presence correlated with age, we
trained a Random Forests regression model for predicting subject
age using contig abundances from the control group. This identi-
fied contigs with high feature importance, indicating their impor-
tance for accurate prediction of age. Fig. 4A shows a heat map of
the 55 age-discriminatory contigs identified using this approach.
When used to train a new Random Forests model, these 55 age-
discriminatory contigs explained 65.04% of the observed variance
in age, compared with 54.98% when using the full set of contigs.
An out-of-bag (OOB) estimate of errors, which iteratively uses a
training set of the data to predict the behavior of remaining data,
provides a rigorous estimate of the generalization error in Random
Forests models (47). The correlation coefficient of the Pearson
correlation between OOB-predicted age with the chronological age
of control subjects was 0.830 (P < 2.2e-16; Fig. 4B), indicating that
the 55 age-discriminatory contigs accurately predicted the age of
controls. The resulting Random Forests model also successfully
predicted the age of cases (r = 0.764, P < 2.2e-16; Fig. 4B), sug-
gesting that cases experience similar developmental virome changes
as controls. The prediction accuracy was slightly worse compared
with the training data, however (Fig. 4B). Although this difference
may be explained by the training data bias, it also suggests the
virome of cases diverged from those presented during normal de-
velopment within these age-discriminatory contigs.
We then performed the reciprocal analysis using contig abun-
dance information from cases. Sixty-five age-discriminatory contigs
were identified in cases. Thirteen of these contigs were shared with
the age-discriminative contigs identified in the controls. When used
to train a new Random Forests model, these 65 age-discriminatory
contigs explained 69.15% of the observed variance in age of cases,
compared with 66.51% when using the full set of contigs. As ob-
served for controls, the model accurately predicted the age of cases
and controls, with only a small difference in the predictions of
cases and controls (Fig. 4C). Here the Pearson correlation co-
efficient between the predicted age (OOB-predicted age used for
case subjects) with the chronological age was 0.836 (P < 2.2e-16)
for cases and 0.617 (P = 1.93e-12) for controls (Fig. 4C).
Nonetheless, even though the age-discriminative contigs identi-
fied from the training data had the same predictive power for the
training data (r = 0.830 for controls compared with r = 0.836 for
cases; Fig. 4 B and C), they performed differently for the testing
data. The age of controls predicted using age-discriminative con-
tigs identified from cases (r = 0.617, P = 1.93e-12; Fig. 4C) were
less accurately predicted than the age of cases predicted using age-
discriminative contigs identified from controls (r = 0.764, P <
2.22e-16; Fig. 4B). This suggests that some of the bacteriophage
signatures associated with age change in cases may be disease-
related rather than age-associated. Therefore, only the 55 contigs
identified in controls were considered age-discriminatory contigs
and were subtracted from total contigs for the downstream analysis
of establishing disease-discriminatory contigs.
Disease-Discriminatory Viral Contigs. After removing potentially
confounding age-discriminatory contigs, we used Random Forests
to identify contigs that can distinguish the viromes of cases and
controls from within the remaining 3,618 viral contigs. We iden-
tified these disease-discriminative contigs using a method that it-
eratively fits Random Forests models with each iteration building a
new forest after discarding contigs with the smallest feature im-
portance score (48). This analysis identified 102 contigs as disease-
discriminative (Fig. S3A). We measured the frequency of a contig
being selected as the discriminative contig to quantify sampling
variability and confidence in discriminative-feature identification
(49). Fig. S3B shows the selection probability against the feature
importance rank of the top 102 contigs. The best contig was se-
lected as discriminatory 100% of the time, whereas 16 additional
contigs were selected in >90% of the bootstrap samples (Fig. S3B).
We defined those contigs with a selection probability of ≥80% as
the most discriminative contigs for disease status. This identified
36 contigs that were most discriminative for future disease status
(Fig. 5), and these were ranked by the selection probability in the
bootstrap samples (Dataset S3).
We next compared the abundance of these 36 contigs via an
independent approach using repeated measures ANOVA with
permutation test. The abundance of contig 1 differed significantly
between cases and controls. Furthermore, the direction of change
in average contig abundance over time differed between cases and
controls for 12 contigs (Dataset S3 and Fig. 5). Contig 1, a 65,411-bp
complete circular genome, was always selected as a disease-
discriminative contig in the bootstrap samples (Dataset S3). Cases
had significantly higher abundance of this contig than controls
using repeated measures ANOVA with permutation test (P =
0.025; Fig. 5). This contig shared the highest nucleotide sequence
similarity to the genome of bacteria B. dorei CL03T12C01 (5,769 of
6,464, 89%; e-value = 0). At the amino acid level, specific ORFs in

 this contig shared significant sequence similarity with several bac-

as well as the integrase (413 of 413, 100%; e-value = 0) and
transposase (404 of 404, 100%; e-value = 0) of multiple bacterio-
phage proteins of the prophage of Bacteroides.
Contig 5, a 71,649-bp complete circular genome, was selected as
disease-discriminative in 98% of the bootstrap samples (Dataset
S3). Contig 5 was more abundant in cases than in controls, and the
change over time differed significantly between cases and controls
(P = 0.018; Fig. 5). This contig shared the greatest nucleotide
sequence similarity to the genome of bacteria B. dorei CL03T12C01
(20,546 of 20,823, 99%; e-value = 0). At the amino acid level,
specific ORFs in this contig shared significant sequence similarity
with several bacteriophage proteins: phage tail length tape
measure protein of Bacteroides pyogenes DSM 20611 = JCM
6294 (804 of 1,182, 68%; e-value = 0), phage portal protein
of Bacteroides sp. 2_2_4, Bacteroides ovatus and multiple other
species (485 of 485, 100%; e-value = 0), phage/plasmid primase of
various Bacteroides strains (545 of 545, 100%; e-value = 0), as well
as the phage terminase large subunit of Bacteroides sp. 9_1_42FAA
(541 of 544, 99%; e-value = 0), integrase (379 of 379, 100%;
e-value = 0), and transposase (404 of 404, 100%; e-value = 0)
of multiple bacteriophage proteins of prophages of Bacteroides.
Even though both contig 1 and contig 5 shared sequence similarity
to prophages of Bacteroides, they had very limited sequence simi-
larity to one another (209 of 310, 67% at the nucleotide level and
94 of 155, 61% at the amino acid level). The abundances of contig
1 and contig 5 were significantly correlated (2.50e-13), but the
correlation was weak (Pearson correlation coefficient r = 0.467)
with some samples containing tens- to hundreds-fold more of
one contig than the other, suggesting that contig 1 and contig
5 may represent phages of different bacteria.
Interestingly, we detected one bacteriophage contig (contig
10) that was absent in cases. With a circular complete genome
of 97,014 nt and a selection probabilty of 0.945 as disease-
discriminative, contig 10 is distantly related to crAssphage, with
nucleotide sequence similarity in a 201-bp region. At the amino
acid level, several ORFs encoded by contig 10 share 25–34%
sequence identity with different proteins of crAssphage.
Altered Relationships Between Bacteria and Bacteriophages in the
Cases. After identifying certain bacteriophage sequences as
disease-discriminative, we next characterized the relationships be-
tween viruses and bacterial taxa present in the samples. We calcu-
lated the Spearman correlation between the disease-discriminatory
contigs and the bacterial OTUs from previously published data for
the same samples (11). Significantly correlated OTUs were se-
lected if the false discovery rate (FDR)-corrected P was ≤0.1. This
analysis detected 27 significant associations between 15 disease-
discriminatory contigs and nine unique OTUs from four different
families (Dataset S4). The abundance of contig 1 was positively
associated with B. ovatus in the Bacteroidaceae family and OTUs
of Bifidobacterium genus in the Bifidobacteriaceae family (Dataset
S4). Contig 5 was inversely correlated with OTUs of the Roseburia
genus in the Lachnospiraceae family and positively associated with
Bacteroides fragilis and B. ovatus in the Bacteroidaceae family.
Significant correlations of disease-discriminative contigs with dif-
ferent bacteria OTUs, including both positive and negative cor-
relations, were found in controls and cases (Fig. 6), suggesting a
distinct virome-bacterial microbiome relationship in controls ver-
sus cases even before seroconversion occurred.
Discussion
Here we report a comprehensive analysis of the intestinal eukaryotic
and bacteriophage virome in children at risk for the development
of T1D, an important human autoimmune disease. This analysis
revealed many correlations between the intestinal virome and
human autoimmune disease risk. Although the cohort was rela-
tively small (11 cases and 11 controls), the longitudinal collection
of samples and the total number of samples analyzed (220)
provided sufficient statistical power to detect significant changes
in the virome related to autoimmunity. For eukaryotic viruses,
we detected a higher prevalence and abundance of Circoviridae-
related sequences in controls compared with cases. We frequently
detected anellovirus, enterovirus, parechovirus, parvovirus, and
reovirus sequences, but these were not statistically associated with
autoimmune disease. For bacteriophages, we detected signifi-
cantly higher virome diversity in controls using multiple ap-
proaches. Furthermore, we identified disease-discriminatory
bacteriophage contigs whose presence correlated with the
abundance of specific bacteria taxa, such as Bacteroides and
Bifidobacterium. Taken together, our data reveal substantial
and complex relationships between the intestinal virome and
the risk of a major human autoimmune disease.
Cases and Controls Share the Same Developmental Change in the
Virome. There is great variation in the gut virome among indi-
viduals (28, 34, 46, 50). We found the greatest similarity in fecal
viromes within an individual over time as reported previously (28,
34, 46, 50). Intrapersonal variation for both control subjects as a
group and cases as a group was significantly lower than the in-
terpersonal variation within these two groups (Fig. 2A). In addition,
our findings suggest the presence of a set of viral signatures that
were remarkably consistent across individuals and defined the nor-
mal development of the virome. The application of Random Forests
regression established a set of age-discriminative contigs that were
highly predictive of the developmental changes in the intestinal
virome. These data also suggest that time-dependent changes in
these viruses were similar across biologically unrelated individuals
and were related to the developmental stage of the subject.

 Changes in the Virome in Subjects at Risk for T1D. Previous studies
found no association between viruses and T1D in stool samples
collected 3, 6, and 9 mo before the date of the first islet autoantibody-
positive result (20, 21). In the present study, we detected a signifi-
cantly lower abundance of Circoviridae-related sequences and low
virome diversity in cases. The differences between these studies could
be related to differences in sampling method, sequencing technique,
or viral sequence detection methods (27), or to the smaller cohort of
the previous study (96 samples vs. our 220 samples) (20, 21). We
found reduced statistical significance when we divided the case sub-
jects into two subgroups, with and without progression to T1D. The
fact that the previous study analyzed only a random selection of
100,000 raw sequence reads from each sample also could help ex-
plain the discrepant results, given that we analyzed a significantly
larger number of sequences from each subject.
Viruses in the Circoviridae family have small circular genomes.
This group of viruses includes the circoviruses. Porcine circovirus
type 2 has been linked to postweaning multisystemic wasting dis-
ease in pigs, and disease onset and symptom severity are influenced
by intrinsic factors, such as immune system status and genetic
predisposition (51). No circoviruses have yet been linked to human
diseases. Our observation of greater abundance and prevalence of
Circoviridae-related sequences in controls suggests that infection
with the virus offers benefits to the host, as observed in animal
models for other viruses (22–24) and might offer protection from
the development of autoimmune diabetes, as has been shown in
animal studies for other types of viruses (25, 26). However, the
sample size in terms of number of subjects is small in this cohort,
and these sequences were not detected in every control subject.
Caution should be taken in interpreting these results, and future
studies including studies in a validation cohort are important for
validating this significant observation.
Multiple lines of evidence suggest that over time, the develop-
mental trajectory of viromes differed between children who de-
veloped autoimmunity and those who did not. First, the dynamic
change in Shannon diversity over time was different between con-
trols and cases for Microviridae, Myoviridae, and Podoviridae. Sec-
ond, changes in richness over time differed between controls and
cases for Microviridae, Myoviridae, and Podoviridae. Third, Random
Forests analysis of age-discriminative contigs suggested differences
between cases and controls. This is consistent with a model in which
cases acquire disease-associated contigs in addition to the normal
changes in bacteriophages that occur as children age.
Because the virome changes reported here occurred before se-
roconversion, our data raise the possibility that virome change could
trigger seroconversion. The detection of disease-discriminative
contigs provides targets for future mechanistic studies to distin-
guish between causal and incidental association relationships among
bacteriophages and the development of autoimmunity in subjects at
risk for T1D.
Relationship Between Bacteriophage Sequences and Bacterial Dysbiosis
in Children at Risk for T1D. No overt changes in the bacterial micro-
biome community structure before seroconversion have been re-
ported in previous studies, including a study using the same cohort and
samples studied here (11, 52). In contrast, pronounced alterations of
the intestinal bacterial microbiome occurring after seroconversion
and preceding overt T1D have been reported (7, 11, 53). However,
an increase of a single species of bacteria, B. dorei, in cases before
seroconversion was observed in another study (8). Bacteria in the
Bacteroides genus, particularly the B. fragilis group, which includes B.
fragilis, B. ovatus, and B. vulgatus, were found to enhance bacterial
translocation (54). Bacteroides lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is structurally
distinct from Escherichia coli LPS and inhibits innate immune sig-
naling and endotoxin tolerance, suggesting that it may preclude im-
mune development in early infancy (9). Notably, some of the disease-
discriminative bacteriophage contigs detected were related to pro-
phages in Bacteroides. It is interesting to speculate that changes in lytic
and lysogenic cycles before seroconversion might contribute to the
observed virome changes without substantially altering the bacterial
microbiome composition. Furthermore, it is possible that changes
in the bacterial microbiome observed later in the course of the
development of autoimmune disease might be secondary to these
earlier changes in bacteriophages.
In the present study, 27 significant associations between disease-
discriminate contigs and bacteria OTUs were detected, and the
significantly associated bacteria OTUs were clustered in four genera:
Bifidobacterium (Bifidobacteriaceae), Bacteroides (Bacteroidaceae),
Roseburia (Lachnospiraceae), and Veillonella (Veillonellaceae). Most
of the disease-discriminatory contigs were significantly correlated
with bacterial OTUs belonging to the Bacteroides genus
(B. ovatus, B. vulgates, and B. fragilis; Dataset S4). These taxa were
found to be increased in cases in multiple studies (6). In addition,
multiple disease-discriminatory contigs were significantly correlated
with bacterial OTUs that belonged to the Bifidobacterium, whereas
decreases in the relative abundance of Lachnospiraceae and Veil-
lonellaceae were detected in cases after seroconversion in a bacteria
microbiome study using the same cohort (11). Bifidobacterium was

 significantly decreased in children who developed autoimmunity but
had not progressed to T1D (7). The levels of Bifidobacterium have
been related to improved glucose metabolism, insulin resistance,
and low-grade inflammation (55, 56).
Given the relationship between bacteriophages and bacterial
hosts, it is conceivable that the changes in bacteriophages before
seroconversion modulate bacterial abundance and eventually
lead to overt bacteria dysbiosis. Because single nucleotide
changes in the bacteriophage genome could change the tropism
of the bacteriophage (57), the possible molecular basis for these
associations between bacterial OTUs and the disease-discriminatory
contigs is unclear; however, it is interesting that our virome
study and previous bacteria microbiome study detected signals
from the same genera. Importantly, based on our findings, the
possibility exists that these changes are regulated by, or the
effects are countered by, CRESS DNA viruses. This suggests
the hypothesis that the balance between protective and disease
causing changes in the virome may modulate human autoim-
mune disease in genetically susceptible individuals. This would
be consistent with the finding that viruses can interact with host
disease risk genes to modulate diseases in mice (22, 58, 59).
Taken together, these findings in a single cohort suggest a
model in which the risk for human autoimmunity (in this case
T1D) is related to a combination of protective vs. disease risk-
conferring effects of the virome.
