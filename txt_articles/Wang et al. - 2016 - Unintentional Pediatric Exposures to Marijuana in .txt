IMPORTANCE As of 2015, almost half of US states allow medical marijuana, and 4 states allow
recreational marijuana. To our knowledge, the effect of recreational marijuana on the
pediatric population has not been evaluated.
OBJECTIVE To compare the incidence of pediatric marijuana exposures evaluated at a
children’s hospital and regional poison center (RPC) in Colorado before and after recreational
marijuana legalization and to compare population rate trends of RPC cases for marijuana
exposures with the rest of the United States.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Retrospective cohort study of hospital admissions and
RPC cases between January 1, 2009, and December 31, 2015, at Children’s Hospital Colorado,
Aurora, a tertiary care children’s hospital. Participants included patients 0 to 9 years of age
evaluated at the hospital’s emergency department, urgent care centers, or inpatient unit and
RPC cases from Colorado for single-substance marijuana exposures.
EXPOSURE Marijuana.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Marijuana exposure visits and RPC cases, marijuana source
and type, clinical effects, scenarios, disposition, and length of stay.
RESULTS Eighty-one patients were evaluated at the children’s hospital, and Colorado’s RPC
received 163 marijuana exposure cases between January 1, 2009, and December 31, 2015,
for children younger than 10 years of age. The median age of children’s hospital visits was
2.4 years (IQR, 1.4-3.4); 25 were girls (40%) . The median age of RPC marijuana exposures
was 2 years (IQR, 1.3-4.0), and 85 patients were girls (52%). The mean rate of
marijuana-related visits to the children'
s hospital increased from 1.2 per 100 000 population
2 years prior to legalization to 2.3 per 100,000 population 2 years after legalization (P = .02).
Known marijuana products involved in the exposure included 30 infused edibles (48%).
Median length of stay was 11 hours (interquartile range [IQR], 6-19) and 26 hours (IQR, 19-38)
for admitted patients. Annual RPC pediatric marijuana cases increased more than 5-fold from
2009 (9) to 2015 (47). Colorado had an average increase in RPC cases of 34% (P < .001) per
year while the remainder of the United States had an increase of 19% (P < .001). For 10
exposure scenarios (9%), the product was not in a child-resistant container; for an additional
40 scenarios (34%), poor child supervision or product storage was reported. Edible products
were responsible for 51 exposures (52%).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Colorado RPC cases for pediatric marijuana increased
significantly and at a higher rate than the rest of the United States. The number of children’s
hospital visits and RPC case rates for marijuana exposures increased between the 2 years
prior to and the 2 years after legalization. Almost half of the patients seen in the children’s
hospital in the 2 years after legalization had exposures from recreational marijuana,
suggesting that legalization did affect the incidence of exposures.

tolegalizerecreationalmarijuanaasof2014.1,2Twenty-
three states have passed medical marijuana legislation; 4 of
these states passed legislation between 2012 and 2014.2 Colo-
rado allowed medical marijuana in 2000, although the indus-
try did not flourish until 2009, when the US Justice Depart-
ment did not seek arrest of marijuana users and suppliers if
they conformed to state laws, and recreational marijuana be-
came available for purchase in January 2014.3,4
Medical and recreational marijuana is available in a vari-
etyofproducts:cigarettes/vaporizers,high-concentratedprod-
ucts, and infused edibles. In Colorado, the percentage of tet-
rahydrocannabinol(THC)inmarijuanaavailableforsaleranges
between 19% and 30%, compared with the 3% to 6% of THC
in marijuana available for research by the National Institutes
of Health.5,6 Colorado generated $573 million in revenue in the
first year of recreational sales, and edible products accounted
for 45% of the state’s marijuana industry.7,8
In 2015, the American Academy of Pediatrics published a
policy statement reaffirming its opposition to legalizing
marijuana,9 citing the potential harm to children and adoles-
cents. States that decriminalized medical marijuana have
shown an increase in emergency department (ED) visits and
regional poison center (RPC) cases for unintentional pediat-
ric marijuana exposures.10-12 Based on this data, Colorado and
Washington became the first states to pass preventive regu-
lations: child-resistant packaging (CRP), warning labels, dose
limitations, marketing limitations, and public health educa-
tional/media campaigns.4,13 In Colorado, packaging rules (Rule
R 1004.5) became permanent on October 30, 2014, with fa-
cilities and stores required to be in compliance by February 1,
20154; Washington packaging rules (WSR 314-55-015) be-
came effective June 20, 2015.13 The objective of our study was
to evaluate the effect of legalization of recreational mari-
juana on unintentional pediatric exposures.
Methods
This was a retrospective study of cases presenting to Chil-
dren’s Hospital Colorado, Aurora, and exposure cases called
to an RPC in Colorado, a state with medical and recreational
marijuana legalization as of January 2014, between January
1, 2009, and December 31, 2015. The hospital is a tertiary care,
freestanding children’s hospital with an annual ED census of
65 000 visits (120 000 visits including its network of EDs and
urgent care centers [UCs]). Children’s hospital patient inclu-
sion criteria were patients 0 to 9 years of age who were evalu-
atedatthathospital’sED,UC,orinpatientunits(inpatientward
or critical care unit) for a single-substance marijuana expo-
sure. Hospital cases were identified using an electronic medi-
cal record search for patients with either a positive urine drug
screen (UDS) for THC or an International Classification of Dis-
eases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) code for cannabis abuse (305.20),
poisoning for psychodysleptics (969.9), or accidental poison-
ing by psychodysleptics (E854.1). For hospital admission rates,
annual counts for ICD-9 codes of poisoning by drugs, medici-
nals, and biological substances (960-979) and accidental poi-
soning by drugs, medicinal substances, and biologics (E850-
E858)wereobtained.InOctober2015,hospitalcodingchanged
to the ICD-10. Equivalent ICD-10 codes were generated from
ICD-9searchcriteria:F12(for305.20),T40(969.6),T15-19(930-
939), T36-50 (960-979, E850-858), T51-T65 (980-989, E860-
869), and W65-74 and T21.0-21.0 (E910-919). Hospital cases
were reviewed by a single investigator (G.S.W.), and variables
were abstracted onto a standardized collection form. Hospi-
tal variables included age, sex, year of visit, whether history
of exposure was available on presentation, exposure to medi-
cal or recreational marijuana, source and dose of marijuana if
available, product, disposition, ancillary laboratory tests per-
formed, hospital length of stay, and whether a social work con-
sultationwasobtained.TheColoradoMultipleInstitutionalRe-
view Board approved the study, granting a waiver of informed
consent because the study was retrospective and investiga-
tors did not have direct contact with patients.
The RPC receives almost 100 000 human exposure calls
annually. Regional poison center cases from Colorado were
identified using the marijuana generic code (0083000) for
single-agent exposures and closed cases for patients aged 0 to
9years.Variablesincludedage,sex,yearofcall,locationofcall,
site of exposure, level of health care facility, exposure rea-
son,routeofexposure,caller-documentedclinicaleffects(signs
and symptoms), scenario, therapy, disposition, medical out-
comes (classified as no, minor, moderate, or major effect as de-
fined by the National Poison Data System), and coding for ed-
ible products (available only for 2013-2015).
Descriptive statistics were calculated. Medians with in-
terquartile ranges (IQRs) were reported for continuous out-
comes; frequencies and percentages were calculated for cat-
egoricaloutcomes.GeneralizedlinearmodelingusingaPoisson
distributionwasusedtocomparethenumberofpediatricmari-
juana cases per population, aged 0 to 9 years, over time for
Colorado compared with the rest of the United States. Gener-
alized linear modeling using a Poisson distribution was also

Key Points
Question What is the effect of recreational marijuana legalization
on pediatric marijuana exposures?
Findings This retrospective cohort study evaluating pediatric
marijuana exposures at a children’s hospital and regional poison
center in Colorado before and after recreational legalization
demonstrated that marijuana exposure visits and population rates
at the children’s hospital significantly increased in the 2 years
following legalization compared with the 2 years prior to
legalization; the regional poison center exposure call average and
population rates also significantly increased.
Meaning With an increase in unintentional pediatric exposures
after legalization of recreational marijuana in Colorado, continued
surveillance is critical, as is evaluating effective preventative
measures as more states consider legalization.

after legalization (2014 and 2015). A log link was used for this
analysis because it constrains predicted values to be greater
than 0. Total ED visit rates for ingestions were scaled per 1000
cases in children aged 0 to 9 years. Estimated annual census
data for children 0 to 9 years, from 2009 through 2014, were
obtained from http://www.census.gov. Estimated census data
for 2014 were used for 2015 because 2015 estimates were not
availableatthetimeofdataanalysis.Populationrateswerealso
calculated by dividing the total number of pediatric mari-
juana visits at the children’s hospital by the Colorado pediat-
ric population in each year from census data. Population rates
were scaled per 100 000 children 0 to 9 years of age. Both rates
convey valuable information: the total ED visit rates explain
the changes in hospital admission patterns, and population
rates describe overall changes. Similarly, total call and census
population rates were compared using the poison center data.
The P value for the change was determined by comparing the
regression estimates with the Poisson distribution. All analy-
ses were performed with SAS, version 9.3 (SAS Institute, Inc)
and plotting was conducted using R, version 3.2.2 (R Founda-
tion for Statistical Computing).
Results
Children’s Hospital
Eighty-one patients evaluated at the children’s hospital had
either a positive UDS for THC or ICD-9 code (or ICD-10 equiva-
lent) between January 1, 2009, and December 31, 2015. Nine-
teenpatientswereeliminatedbecausemarijuanaexposurewas
not their primary diagnosis, leaving 62 patients for analysis.
The annual numbers of exposures from 2009 to 2015 ranged
from 1 visit in 2009 to 16 in 2015 (Figure 1). When compared
with 2 years prior to legalization, the average marijuana ex-
posurevisits(4.3to6.4per1000EDvisits)andpopulationrates
(1.2 to 2.3 per 100 000 population) at the children's hospital
increased compared with the 2 years after legalization. (P = .19
and P = .02, respectively) (Table).
The median age of patients was 2.4 years (IQR, 1.4-3.4); 25
(40%)weregirls.Threeofthe16patientsin2012and2013(19%)
presented with a history of marijuana exposure; in contrast,
18 of the 32 patients (56%) in 2014 and 2015 had a history of
marijuana exposure on presentation. In 2012 and 2013, 11 pa-
tients(69%)hadmedicalworkupsincludingatleast1othertest
performed in addition to a UDS. In 2014 and 2015, 12 of the 32
patients (38%) had either no testing or only a UDS as part of
their medical evaluation. Between 2009 and 2015, 21 of 62 ex-
posures (34%) were from medical marijuana; 15 of the 32 ex-
posures (47%) in 2014 and 2015 were from known recre-
ational products. The sources of the marijuana were a parent
(27), grandparent (8), neighbor/friend/babysitter (8), and other
family member (7). Known marijuana products involved in the
exposure included 30 infused edible products (48%): 17 baked
goods (cookies, brownies, and cake), 10 candies, and 2 pop-
corn products. Forty patients (65%) were observed in the ED
orUC,and13patients(21%)wereadmittedtoaninpatientward
unit. An additional 9 patients (15%) were admitted to the in-
tensive care unit. Two of these required respiratory support:
a 3-year-old who was intubated for apnea and an 8-month-
old who received continuous positive pressure for respira-
tory insufficiency. The median length of stay for all patients
was 11 hours (IQR, 6-19 hours), including patients observed in
the ED; the median length of stay for admitted patients was
26 hours (IQR, 19-38). Forty-nine patients (79%) received a

Regional Poison Center
Colorado’s RPC received 163 marijuana exposure cases be-
tween January 1, 2009, and December 31, 2015, for children
younger than 10 years of age (Figure 1). The annual number of
marijuana exposure cases increased more than 5-fold, from 9
in 2009 to 47 in 2015. Colorado had an mean increase in RPC
cases for marijuana exposure of 34% (95% CI, 22%-47%;
P < .001)peryear,whiletheremainderoftheUnitedStateshad
anaverageincreaseincasesof19%(95%CI,12%-27%,P < .001).
The difference between Colorado compared with the remain-
der of the United States was significant (P = .04) (Figure 2). The
RPC’s mean marijuana exposure case and population rates sig-
nificantlyincreasedbetweenthe2yearsbefore(2012-2013)and
the 2 years after legalization (2014-2015) (Table).
The median age of RPC marijuana exposures was 2 years
(IQR, 1.3-4.0), and 85 patients were girls (52%). Of these ex-
posure cases, 61 (37%) originated from their own residence
while 97 (60%) were from a health care facility. The remain-
ingcaseswerefromaschool(1[<1%]),workplace(1[<1%]),other
(1 [<1%]), other residence (1 [<1%]), or unknown location
(1 [<1%]). Most exposure sites were in the child’s own resi-
dence (143 [88%]), followed by school (5 [3%]) and other (15
[9%]). Most exposures were unintentional (135 [83%]), but 2
exposures were intentional (1%), 5 were adverse drug reac-
tions (3%), 4 were other contamination/tampering (3%), and
17 had unknown exposure reasons (10%). Ingestion (121 [74%])
was the most common route of exposure reported, followed
by unknown route (19 [12%]), inhalation (18 [11%]), dermal
(3 [2%]), and multiple routes of exposure (2 [1%]). Most chil-
dren were treated at a health care facility (99 [61%]) or re-
ferredtoahealthcarefacility(38[23%]);22patients(14%)were
treatedwherethecalloriginated(non–healthcarefacility),and
4 (2%) were treated in unknown or other locations. Most chil-
dren had either no (45 [28%]) or minor effects (75 [46%]). Eigh-
teen children (11%) experienced moderate effects, and 4 (3%)
had major effects. An additional 20 children (12%) had mini-
maleffects,effectswerenotfollowed,orwereunrelated.There
was 1 reported death in an 11-month-old. The patient pre-
sented to the hospital unresponsive and in a wide complex
tachycardia with a severe metabolic acidosis (pH of 6.7). The
patient underwent cardiopulmonary resuscitation for 20
minutes without return of spontaneous circulation. Urine
drug screen results were positive for THC and confirmed on
postmortem analysis. The final diagnosis after autopsy was
myocarditis.
Clinical effects reported were drowsiness/lethargy (80
[49%]), ataxia/dizziness (20 [12%]), agitation (13 [8%]), vom-
iting (8 [5%]), tachycardia (9 [6%]), dystonia/muscle rigidity
(4 [2%]), respiratory depression (4 [2%]), bradycardia/
hypotension(4[2%]),andseizures(5[3%]).Patientscouldhave
more than 1 clinical effect. For 17 exposure scenarios (10%), the
product was not in a CRP and in an additional 51 scenarios
(31%), poor child supervision or product storage were re-
ported. Edible products were attributed to 51 of the 99 expo-
sure cases (52%) from 2013 through 2015 (RPC coding for mari-
juana food products was initiated in 2013).
Discussion
Colorado’s RPC rate of marijuana exposure cases increased by
34%between2009and2015andwassignificantlygreaterthan
the remainder of the United States. Both the children’s hospi-
talvisitsandtheRPC’smeanmarijuanaexposurecensuspopu-
lation–adjusted rates increased from the 2 years prior to the 2
years after legalization. Fifteen of the 32 exposures seen in the
children’s hospital in 2014 and 2015 were from recreational
marijuana,suggestingthatthelegalizationofrecreationalmari-
juana did affect the incidence of pediatric exposures.
Theseunintentionalmarijuanaexposuresrepresentasmall
fraction of the total pediatric ingestions and exposures pre-
senting to the ED and RPC cases. In 2014, poison centers re-
ported 1 031 927 exposures in children younger than 6 years.14

toddler exposures because they are much more common and
available in the household.14 However, as marijuana be-
comes more available, exposures may continue to increase.
Furthemore, compared with most unintentional pediatric ex-
posures, symptoms after marijuana exposure can be severe:
35% of patients presenting to the hospital required admis-
sion, increasing the hospital burden and using more health fi-
nancial resources. The severity of symptoms and need for
medical evaluation seen in this study likely resulted from the
combination of the age (toddler), the form (edible), and dose
(THC) of marijuana. The reported death from myocarditis in

Ingestionofedibleproductscontinuestobeamajorsource
of marijuana exposures in children and poses a unique prob-
lem because no other drug is infused into a palatable and ap-
petizing form. These palatable products are often indistin-
guishable from the noninfused products. Dosing a drug in a
“serving size” less than typically recommended for an equiva-
lent food product also can be a source of confusion. For ex-
ample, a marijuana chocolate bar can contain multiple 10-mg
THC single-dose units. In adults, overconsumption of edible
projects is associated with an increase in ED visits resulting
from dysphoric reactions, panic attacks, and anxiety.12 Edibles
have also been blamed for 3 adult deaths in Colorado.15,16
Colorado, Washington, Oregon, and Alaska passed sev-
eral regulations to prevent pediatric exposures including
CRP. Child-resistant packaging is a proven successful
method of exposure prevention and is required by the Poi-
son Prevention Packaging Act for prescription medications,
scheduled drugs, and hazardous household chemicals.17-20
Requiring CRP from the marijuana industry would seem like
a logical step in prevention. However, CRP is a deterrent and
does not guarantee that a child is unable to open the con-
tainer and is not a substitute for proper safe storage. Child-
resistant packaging only functions when the product is kept
in the original packaging and the child-resistant system
remains intact with repeated package access. State packag-
ing regulations only apply to purchased products and will
not be of any benefit to families who are not educated about
proper home storage techniques (eg, up and out of reach/
sight) or those who create home products. At the time of the
exposure, marijuana products were not in CRP in 9% of
exposures, and in an additional 34%, the marijuana products
were inappropriately stored (eg, in plain site or left out) or
the child was not being supervised. This was not consis-
tently documented by the RPC, so the true number of expo-
sures associated with inappropriate storage or lack of CRP
use is unknown. The effectiveness of CRP to prevent unin-
tentional marijuana exposures is unclear because the rate of
exposure continued to rise. However, state implementation
of this requirement did not become mandatory until 2015.
Furthermore, the increased public availability of marijuana
products may be the predominant driving factor for the ris-
ing number of exposures. As of March 2016, commericializa-
tion of marijuana has led to 424 retail marijuana stores, 503
marijuana cultivators, 173 product manufacturers, and
15 testing facilities in Colorado.21 Other preventive measures
may need to be emphasized including public health cam-
paigns, regulations that limit home production, or further
evaluation of lower dose limitations in commercial
products.22,23
Families of patients in Colorado disclosed a history of
marijuana exposure on presentation to the hospital more
frequently after legalization of recreational marijuana. In
2014 and 2015, 18 patients (56%) presented with a known
history of marijuana exposure compared with 3 patients
(19%) in 2012 and 2013. This comfort level of disclosure may
be owing to the perception that there will be fewer legal and
social ramifications because of legalization. The history of
marijuana exposure facilitates timely and appropriate care.
Without history of exposure or when the diagnosis is
unclear, children have received unnecessary laboratory test-
ing, procedures, and radiographic imaging because expo-
sures can mimic other central nervous system depressants.10
As health care professionals become more familiar with the
pediatric marijuana toxidrome, unnecessary expensive diag-
nostic workups may decrease. In 2014 and 2015, one-third of
the patients were treated with observation and less exten-
sive testing.
Social work consultations decreased from 28 exposures
(93%) from 2009 through 2013, including every patient in
2012 and 2013, to 21 (66%) in 2014 and 2015. Similar to other
unintentional ingestions and exposures of legal products
such as pharmaceuticals, ethanol, or household chemicals,
there is no standard on reporting marijuana exposures. How-
ever, allowing access to high-potency marijuana products
can be deemed negligent, similar to allowing access to
potentially harmful pharmaceuticals, household products,
or ethanol. Whether to report marijuana exposures to social
services continues to be a source of debate without consen-
sus among medical professionals, child welfare agencies,
law enforcement, and the public. Regardless of the expo-
sure, we would advocate reporting if concerns of neglect,
abuse, caregiver impairment, or behavior that would be a
risk to the child is noted. Besides unintentional exposures,
important issues for the pediatric population that need to be
addressed include the risk of prenatal and breast feeding
exposures, secondhand marijuana smoke, the effect on ado-
lescent and mental health population, and medicinal uses
(eg, pediatric seizures).
Our study has some limitations. This was a retrospective
review at a tertiary care hospital and RPC, so our results
may not be generalizable to other institutions or states. The
abstractor was not blinded to the study question. Both the
electronic medical record and RPC data may have had miss-
ing information and details about the case including source,
product, and details of the clinical case. There also may have
been missed patients based on our inclusion and search cri-
teria. Regional poison center data are a self-reporting data-
base and may underestimate the true number of exposures
within a population.
Conclusions
Therewasanincreaseinunintentionalpediatricexposuresdur-
ing the first 2 years after legalization of recreational mari-
juana in Colorado. Continued surveillance is critical in evalu-
ating the effect marijuana legislation has on the pediatric
population. Edible marijuana products continue to be a sig-
nificant source of pediatric exposures given their attractive-
ness and palatability to children. Identifying successful pre-
ventivestrategiesrequiresfurtherinvestigation.Asmorestates
pass laws legalizing recreational marijuana, legislators and
health care professionals will need to consider strategies to
decrease its effect on the pediatric population.
