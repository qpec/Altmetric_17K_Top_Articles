Background
Seasonal affective disorder (SAD) is a seasonal pattern of recurrent major depressive episodes that most commonly occurs during
autumn or winter and remits in spring. The prevalence of SAD ranges from 1.5% to 9%, depending on latitude. The predictable
seasonal aspect of SAD provides a promising opportunity for prevention. This review - one of four reviews on efficacy and safety of
interventions to prevent SAD - focuses on light therapy as a preventive intervention. Light therapy is a non-pharmacological treatment
that exposes people to artificial light. Mode of delivery (e.g. visors, light boxes) and form of light (e.g. bright white light) vary.
Objectives
To assess the efficacy and safety of light therapy (in comparison with no treatment, other types of light therapy, second-generation
antidepressants, melatonin, agomelatine, psychological therapies, lifestyle interventions and negative ion generators) in preventing SAD
and improving patient-centred outcomes among adults with a history of SAD.
Search methods
A search of the Specialised Register of the Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neuorosis Review Group (CCDANCTR) included all
years to 11 August 2015. The CCDANCTR contains reports of relevant randomised controlled trials derived from EMBASE (1974
to date), MEDLINE (1950 to date), PsycINFO (1967 to date) and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trails (CENTRAL).
Furthermore, we searched the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Web of Knowledge, The Cochrane
Library and the Allied and Complementary Medicine Database (AMED) (to 26 May 2014). We also conducted a grey literature search
and handsearched the reference lists of all included studies and pertinent review articles.

 Selection criteria
For efficacy, we included randomised controlled trials on adults with a history of winter-type SAD who were free of symptoms at the
beginning of the study. For adverse events, we also intended to include non-randomised studies. We intended to include studies that
compared any type of light therapy (e.g. bright white light, administered by visors or light boxes, infrared light, dawn stimulation) versus
no treatment/placebo, second-generation antidepressants (SGAs), psychological therapies, melatonin, agomelatine, lifestyle changes,
negative ion generators or another of the aforementioned light therapies. We also planned to include studies that looked at light therapy
in combination with any comparator intervention and compared this with the same comparator intervention as monotherapy.
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors screened abstracts and full-text publications against the inclusion criteria. Two review authors independently
abstracted data and assessed risk of bias of included studies.
Main results
We identified 2986 citations after de-duplication of search results. We excluded 2895 records during title and abstract review. We
assessed 91 full-text papers for inclusion in the review, but only one study providing data from 46 people met our eligibility criteria.
The included randomised controlled trial (RCT) had methodological limitations. We rated it as having high risk of performance and
detection bias because of lack of blinding, and as having high risk of attrition bias because study authors did not report reasons for
dropouts and did not integrate data from dropouts into the analysis.
The included RCT compared preventive use of bright white light (2500 lux via visors), infrared light (0.18 lux via visors) and no light
treatment. Overall, both forms of preventive light therapy reduced the incidence of SAD numerically compared with no light therapy.
In all, 43% (6/14) of participants in the bright light group developed SAD, as well as 33% (5/15) in the infrared light group and
67% (6/9) in the non-treatment group. Bright light therapy reduced the risk of SAD incidence by 36%; however, the 95% confidence
interval (CI) was very broad and included both possible effect sizes in favour of bright light therapy and those in favour of no light
therapy (risk ratio (RR) 0.64, 95% CI 0.30 to 1.38). Infrared light reduced the risk of SAD by 50% compared with no light therapy,
but in this case also the CI was too broad to allow precise estimations of effect size (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.21 to 1.17). Comparison
of both forms of preventive light therapy versus each other yielded similar rates of incidence of depressive episodes in both groups
(RR 1.29, 95% CI 0.50 to 3.28). The quality of evidence for all outcomes was very low. Reasons for downgrading evidence quality
included high risk of bias of the included study, imprecision and other limitations, such as self rating of outcomes, lack of checking of
compliance throughout the study duration and insufficient reporting of participant characteristics.
Investigators provided no information on adverse events. We could find no studies that compared light therapy versus other interventions
of interest such as SGA, psychological therapies, melatonin or agomelatine.
Authors’ conclusions
Evidence on light therapy as preventive treatment for patients with a history of SAD is limited. Methodological limitations and the
small sample size of the only available study have precluded review author conclusions on effects of light therapy for SAD. Given
that comparative evidence for light therapy versus other preventive options is limited, the decision for or against initiating preventive
treatment of SAD and the treatment selected should be strongly based on patient preferences.

Light therapy for prevention of winter depression
Why is this review important?
Many people in northern latitudes suffer from winter blues, which occurs as a reaction to reduced sunlight. Three-quarters of those
affected are women. Lethargy, overeating, craving for carbohydrates and depressed mood are common symptoms. In some people,
winter blues becomes depression, which seriously affects their daily lives. Up to two-thirds experience depressive symptoms every winter.
Who will be interested in this review?
Anyone who has experienced winter depression, or who has relatives and friends who have experienced winter depression.
What questions does this review aim to answer?

Light therapy for preventing seasonal affective disorder (Review)
Copyright © 2015 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
 In the light of the seasonal pattern and the high rate of recurrence, light therapy during fall and winter months could help to prevent
the onset of depressed mood. The goal of this review was to find out whether light therapy can prevent the onset of depression in winter
when it is used in healthy people with a history of winter depression, and if it is safe. To date, this question has not been examined in
a systematic way, but it is of importance for those who have suffered winter depression.
Which studies were included in the review?
We searched databases up to August 2015 for studies on light therapy to prevent winter depression. Among 2986 records, we found
one randomised controlled study including 46 people who received light therapy or no treatment. All individuals in these studies had
a history of winter depression.
What does the evidence from the review reveal?
The quality of evidence for all outcomes was very low, so we can draw no conclusions about whether light therapy is effective in
preventing winter depression. The included study provided no information on side effects of light therapy.
Doctors need to discuss with patients considering preventive treatment the advantages and disadvantages of light therapy and other
potentially preventive treatments for winter depression, such as drug treatments, psychological therapies or lifestyle interventions. As
no available studies have compared these treatments, patient preferences have to be taken into consideration.
What should happen next?
Review authors recommend that future studies should directly compare light therapy versus other treatments such as drug treatments,
psychological therapies or lifestyle interventions to determine the best treatment for preventing winter depression.

Description of the condition
Seasonal affective disorder (SAD) is a seasonal pattern of recur-
rent major depressive episodes that most commonly occurs dur-
ing autumn or winter and remits in spring or summer (Rosenthal
1984). In addition to the predictable seasonal pattern of depres-
sion, persons suffering from SAD commonly experience atypical
symptoms including hypersomnia, carbohydrate craving with in-
creased appetite and weight gain and extreme fatigue (Sohn 2005).
Prevalence in the United States ranges from 1.5% in southern
Florida to 9% in northern regions (Rosen 1990). In northern
latitudes, the prevalence of SAD is estimated to be about 10%
(Byrne 2008). SAD is a multi-factorial condition. Chronobiolog-
ical mechanisms related to circadian rhythms, melatonin, sero-
tonin turnover and photoperiodism (length of dark hours rela-
tive to light hours in a 24-hour period) are all thought to play
a role in SAD (Ciarleglio 2011; Levitan 2007). A quintessential
and especially harmful quality of this illness is its high risk of re-
currence and persistence. Approximately two-thirds of those diag-
nosed with SAD will face recurrence of these distressing symptoms
the following winter (Rodin 1997). In the five to 11 years follow-
ing initial diagnosis, 22% to 42% of patients still suffer from SAD,
and 33% to 44% develop a non-seasonal pattern in subsequent
episodes; the disorder resolves completely in only 14% to 18%
of patients (Magnusson 2005; Schwartz 1996). Indeed, many pa-
tients who suffer from SAD experience this type of depression ev-
ery year, which makes it particularly amenable to preventive treat-
ment (Westrin 2007).
Description of the intervention
Various interventions such as second-generation antidepressants
(SGAs), light therapy, melatonin or agomelatine, psychological
therapies and lifestyle interventions have been used for prevention
of SAD. Of those, light therapy (e.g. bright white light, dawn sim-
ulation) is a non-pharmacological treatment that has proved effec-
tive and is often used as first-line therapy for individuals with SAD
(Terman 2005). It is commonly applied with use of a light box;
however, application with a light visor (a portable head-mounted
light source) is possible (Pail 2011). To achieve an effect on circa-
dian rhythms, the dosage of bright light given should be greater
than the artificial lighting usually used in homes - about 5000 lux
per day (2500 lux for two hours, or 10,000 lux for 30 minutes)
(Levitan 2005). Dawn simulation, on the other hand, increases
light exposure from 0 to around 200 to 300 lux, over 1.5 to 2.5
hours (Golden 2005). A recent meta-analysis found that the odds
ratio (OR) for remission was similar to that of many pharmaceu-
tical treatments for depression (OR 2.9, 95% confidence interval
(CI) 1.6 to 5.4) (Golden 2005). Patients should be treated with
light therapy units that are specifically designed to treat SAD with
the goal of achieving strong response. Otherwise, these units may
not provide adequate brightness and may not allow appropriate
ultraviolet light filtration (Levitan 2005). Patients do not need to
stare directly into the light (Pail 2011). However, it is important
that the light meets the eye because it is hypothesised that the effect
of light therapy is mediated through the eyes by retinal cells that
are not part of the visual system (Pail 2011). Other forms of light
therapy (e.g. infrared light) are available, but their effectiveness for
patients with SAD is not known.
How the intervention might work
Much research into the origin of SAD has focused on the role of
circadian rhythms and melatonin (Lam 2006). Decreased seasonal
exposure to light through phase shifts in circadian rhythms, result-
ing in alterations of serotonin metabolism, is thought to be a rea-
son for development of SAD. The circadian system is influenced
primarily by the zeitgeber light, and exposure to light acts as a sig-
nal for the circadian clock (Quera-Salva 2011). As a consequence,
light therapy has been studied intensively as treatment for SAD
(Partonen 1998). Underlying hypotheses on the pathophysiology
of SAD, such as the depressogenic effects of melatonin, support
the rationale for light therapy. Light therapy helps to suppress
the release of melatonin and lengthens the photoperiod (Golden
2005). Timing, duration and intensity play an important role in
light therapy. Studies have shown that light therapy is most effec-
tive when administered early in the day (Levitan 2005) because the
typical depressed patient is phase-delayed, and therapy adminis-
tered early in the morning regulates the circadian pattern of mela-
tonin secretion. However, in some patients, evening light therapy
may be more successful, because phase-advanced individuals may
benefit more from the corrective phase delay provided by evening
light therapy (Lewy 1987; Lewy 2006). Seasonal recurrence of de-
pressive episodes provides the rationale for light therapy provided
as preventive treatment for SAD.
Why it is important to do this review
The predictable seasonal aspect of SAD provides a specific and
promisingopportunityforprevention. However, both patientsand
clinicians face much uncertainty in their collaborative decisions
about the choice of a preventive intervention (Westrin 2007). Al-
though a recent Cochrane review assessed the efficacy and risk of
harms of light therapy compared with SGAs for short-term treat-
ment of SAD (Thaler 2010), to date no review has determined
the efficacy, effectiveness and risk of harms of light therapy for
preventing recurrent SAD.
Our findings are intended to provide insights into (1) available
evidence on the benefits and harms of competing interventions in
the prevention of SAD, with respect to patient-centred outcomes,

 and (2) gaps in the evidence base that will inform future research
needs.
This is one of four reviews of interventions to prevent SAD.
The others focus on SGAs (Gartlehner 2014), agomelatine and/or
melatonin (Kaminski-Hartenthaler 2014) and psychological ther-
apies (Forneris 2014) as preventive interventions.

Criteria for considering studies for this review
Types of studies
Efficacy (beneficial effects)
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs; including cross-
over studies and cluster-randomised trials) on light therapy for
prevention of SAD.
Adverse effects
We planned to include the following.
• RCTs (including cross-over studies and cluster-randomised
trials) of light therapy for prevention of SAD.
• Non-randomised controlled studies such as non-
randomised trials, prospective cohort studies or case-control
studies of light therapy for prevention of SAD.
Types of participants
Participant characteristics
Male and female adults (≥ 18 years of age) of all races, ethnicities
and cultural groups, with a history of SAD, who do not fulfil the
criteria for a current major depressive episode.
Diagnosis
We definedSADaccordingtothe Diagnosticand StatisticalManual
of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) (APA 2013) as a seasonal pattern of
recurrent major depressive episodes. However, we restricted our
focus to winter-type SAD (i.e. major depression in the autumn/
winter with full remission in the spring/summer), and we did not
include patients with bipolar disorder with a seasonal pattern. We
included studies that used definitions from prior versions of the
DSM (APA 1980; APA 1987; APA 2000).
Co-morbidities
We excluded studies that enrolled participants with depressive dis-
order due to another medical condition. We planned to include
populations at risk of SAD with common co-morbidities (e.g. di-
abetes, cardiovascular disease) that are not the cause of the depres-
sive episode.
Setting
We included studies conducted in all settings.
Subset data
We intended to include studies that provided data on subsets of
participants of interest, as long as the subset met our eligibility
criteria. We did not include studies with ’mixed’ populations if
investigators did not adequately stratify data with respect to our
population of interest.
Types of interventions
Experimental interventions
We included the following forms of light therapy.
• Bright white light.
• Infrared light.
• Dawn simulation.
We did not limit light therapy in terms of dosage, mode of delivery
orduration. We intendedtoinclude combination therapiesof light
therapy with any of the comparator interventions listed below. We
did not limit light therapy in terms of dosage or duration.
Comparator interventions
We planned to compare any light therapy with:
• another light therapy from the list above;
• placebo, no treatment or waiting list;
• second-generation antidepressants;
• melatonin or agomelatine;
• psychological therapies;
• lifestyle interventions (e.g. exercising, making the
environment sunnier (open blinds), spending regular time
7

 outside, adapting nutrition (consuming a low-fat diet, reducing
refined sugars)); and
• negative ion generators.
We also planned to compare light therapy in combination with
any of the comparator interventions listed above with the same
comparator intervention as monotherapy (see Data extraction and
management).
Types of outcome measures
We included studies that met the above inclusion criteria regard-
less of whether they reported on the following outcomes. In con-
sultation with clinical experts, we selected the following outcomes
a priori.
Primary outcomes
1. The primary outcome for benefit was the incidence of SAD,
measured as the proportion of participants with a SIGH-SAD
(Structured Interview Guide for the Hamilton Depression Rating
Scale, Seasonal Affective Disorders (Williams 2002)) score of 20
or higher.
2. The primary outcome for harms was the overall rate of adverse
events related to preventive interventions.
Secondary outcomes
3. Severity of the SAD episode or SAD-related symptoms, as mea-
sured by a validated tool (e.g. Hamilton Depression Rating Scale
(Hamilton 1960)).
4. Quality of life, as measured by a validated quality of life tool
(e.g. Short Form (SF)-36 (Ware 1992)).
5. Quality of interpersonal and social functioning, as measured
by a validated tool (e.g. the Range of Impaired Functioning Tool
(LIFE-RIFT) (Leon 1999)).
6. Proportion of participants with serious adverse events.
7. Rates of discontinuation of preventive intervention due to ad-
verse events.
8. Overall rate of discontinuation.
Timing of outcome assessment
Depending on available data, we planned to synthesise outcomes
at different time points (i.e. short-term, medium-term and long-
term) throughout an entire six-month period of risk during an
autumn-winter season.
Hierarchy of outcome measures
Our main focus was patient-centred outcomes (i.e. outcomes that
patients notice and care about). If several measures assessed the
same outcome,we consultedaprioriwith clinical expertsregarding
the validity and reliability of individual outcome measures and
prioritised accordingly.
Search methods for identification of studies
The Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Group (CC-
DAN) maintains two clinical trials registers at its editorial base in
Bristol, UK: a references-based register and a studies-based regis-
ter. The CCDAN SpecialisedRegister(CCDANCTR)-References
contains more than 39,000 reports of randomised controlled trials
(RCTs) on depression, anxiety and neurosis. Approximately 60%
of these references have been tagged to individual, coded trials.
The coded trials are held in the Specialised CCDANCTR-Studies
Register, and records are linked between the two registers through
the use of unique Study ID tags. Coding of trials is based on the
EU-Psi coding manual and use of a controlled vocabulary (the
CCDAN Trials Search Co-ordinator can provide further details).
Reports of trials for inclusion in the Group Registers are collated
from routine (weekly), generic searches of MEDLINE (1950-),
EMBASE (1974-) and PsycINFO (1967-); quarterly searches of
the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL);
and review-specific searches of additional databases. Reports of
trials are also obtained from international trials registers through
trials portals of the World Health Organization (the International
Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP)) and pharmaceutical
companies and by handsearching of key journals, conference pro-
ceedings and other (non-Cochrane) systematic reviews and meta-
analyses.
Details of CCDAN’s generic search strategies (used to identify
RCTs) can be found on the Group website.
Electronic searches
• The CCDAN Trials Search Co-ordinator (TSC) ran an
initial search of the Specialised Registers (CCDANCTR-Studies
and CCDANCTR-References) (all years to 12 April 2013) using
terms for conditions only.
◦ (“seasonal affective disorder*” or “seasonal depression” or
“seasonal mood disorder*” or “winter depression” or SIGH-SAD*).
◦ Updated searches were performed to 11 August 2015.
◦ On both occasions, we screened search results for
reports of trials involving light therapy.
• In addition, we conducted our own searches of the
following electronic databases (to 26 May 2014) to ensure that
no studies had been missed by the CCDANCTR (Appendix 1).
◦ International Pharmaceutical Abstracts.
◦ CINAHL (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied
Health Literature).
◦ Web of Knowledge (includes Web of Science, Current
Contents Connect, Conference Proceedings Citation Index,
BIOSIS, Derwent Innovations Index, Data Citation Index,
SciELO Citation Index).
◦ The Cochrane Library.

 ◦ AMED (Allied and Complementary Medicine
Database).
• We searched international trials registries via the World
Health Organization trials portal (ICTRP) and ClinicalTrials.gov
to identify unpublished and ongoing studies. The CCDAN TSC
searched these registries again to 11 August 2015.
We did not restrict searches by date, language or publication status.
Searching other resources
Grey literature
To detect additional studies, we checked the following sources.
• IFPMA (International Federation of Pharmaceutical
Manufacturers and Associations) Clinical Trials Portal.
• OpenGrey.
• GreyMatters.
• National Institute of Health RePORTER.
• Health Services Research Projects in Progress (HSRPROJ).
• Hayes Inc. Health Technology Assessment.
• The New York Academy of Medicine Grey Literature Index.
• Conference Papers Index.
• National Registry of Evidence-Based Programs and
Practices (NREPP).
Reference lists
We handsearched the references of all included studies and perti-
nent review articles.
Correspondence
We contacted trialists and subject matter experts to ask for infor-
mation on unpublished and ongoing studies, or to request addi-
tional trial data.
Data collection and analysis
Selection of studies
Two review authors independently screened the titles and abstracts
of all studiesidentifiedbythe searches.We retrievedfull-textcopies
of all studies that potentially met the inclusion criteria as deter-
mined by this initial assessment, and two review authors indepen-
dently screened them to determine their eligibility.
If the two review authors did not reach consensus, they discussed
disagreementsandresolvedthemthrough consultationwith athird
party. We contacted study authors if relevant information was
missing. We tracked all results in an EndNote X5 database.
We recorded the selection process in sufficient detail to complete
a PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews
and Meta-Analyses) flow diagram and Characteristics of included
studies tables.
Data extraction and management
We used a data collection form. Two review authors independently
extracted study characteristics and outcome data from included
studies (JW, BN). We resolved discrepancies by reaching consen-
sus or by involving another review author. We reported whether
studies were detected by a search of databases of published studies,
by handsearch or by a search of grey literature.
We extracted the following study characteristics.
1. Methods: study design, duration of study, details of any
’run-in’ period, duration of treatment period, number of study
centres and locations, study settings, withdrawals and dates of
studies.
2. Participants: number of participants, mean age, age range,
proportion of women, number of prior depressive episodes,
diagnostic criteria, inclusion criteria and exclusion criteria.
3. Interventions: intervention, comparison, concomitant
interventions and excluded interventions.
4. Outcomes: primary and secondary outcomes specified and
collected and time points reported.
5. Notes: funding for studies and notable conflicts of interest
of study authors.
We noted in the Characteristics of included studies table if out-
come data were not reported in a useable way. We resolved dis-
agreements by reaching consensus or by involving a third person
(BG). One review author (BN) transferred data into the Review
Manager file (RevMan 2012). We double-checked that data were
entered correctly by comparing data presented in the systematic
review versus the study reports. A second review author (AG) spot-
checked study characteristics for accuracy against the trial report.
Main planned comparisons
1. Light therapy versus placebo, no treatment or waiting list.
2. Light therapy versus other light therapy.
3. Light therapy versus second-generation antidepressants.
4. Light therapy versus melatonin or agomelatine.
5. Light therapy versus psychological therapies.
6. Light therapy versus lifestyle intervention.
7. Light therapy versus negative ion generators.
8. Light therapy + comparator intervention (as listed in Types
of interventions) versus placebo or no treatment control group or
waiting list.
9. Light therapy + comparator intervention (as listed in Types
of interventions) versus the same comparator intervention as
monotherapy (e.g. light therapy + psychological therapy vs
psychological therapy alone).

 Assessment of risk of bias in included studies
Two review authors (JW, BN) independently assessed risk of bias
of included randomised trials using the Cochrane ’Risk of bias’
tool, as described in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews
of Interventions (Higgins 2011). This tool includes assessment of
random sequence generation; allocation concealment; blinding of
participants, personnel and outcome assessors; incomplete out-
come data; selective reporting and other potential threats to va-
lidity. Specifically, we assessed attrition in these trials and reasons
for attrition, particularly when attrition rates between two groups
in a trial differed substantially. In addition, we assessed whether
all relevant outcomes for the trial were reported in the published
articles. We assigned each domain high risk of bias, low risk of bias
or unclear risk of bias.
For non-randomised studies, we planned to use the Newcastle-Ot-
tawa Scale, involving selection of cases or cohorts and controls, ad-
justment for confounders, methods of outcome assessment, length
of follow-up and statistical analysis (Wells 2009). Review authors
resolved discrepancies by reaching consensus or by consulting with
a third review author.
Measures of treatment effect
We used data extracted from the original studies to construct 2 × 2
tables for dichotomous outcomes. When multiple studies allowed
for quantitative analysis, we planned to calculate the risk ratio
(RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for each outcome. We
chose risk ratio as an effect measure because for decision makers,
risk ratios are easier to interpret than odds ratios, particularly when
event rates are high.
We planned to pool continuous data using the mean difference
(MD) if an outcome was measured on the same scale, or the stan-
dardised mean difference (SMD) if an outcome was measured on
different scales. If available, we intended to use final measurements
rather than changes from baseline to estimate differences between
treatments. When it was considered necessary to use both change
and post-intervention scores within a comparison, we would have
presented these by subgroup using the MD rather than the SMD.
For time-to-event data, we planned to calculate a pooled hazard
ratio when this was available, or to dichotomise data at multiple
time points into response/no response (e.g. at one week, at two
weeks, at four weeks, etc.).
We intendedtouse the same time pointsasspecifiedunder’Timing
of outcomes assessment’ to form the basis for dichotomisation into
response/no response.
For non-randomised studies, we planned to use adjusted treatment
effects if available.
Unit of analysis issues
Cluster-randomised trials
To incorporate cluster-randomised trials, we intended to reduce
the size of each trial to its ’effective sample size’. If intracluster
correlation coefficients had not been reported, we planned to find
external estimates from similar studies. We intended to undertake
sensitivity analysis to assess the impact of including such trials.
Cross-over trials
To avoid carry-over effects, we planned to include data only from
the first period of cross-over studies.
Studies with multiple treatment groups
For included trials that consisted of multiple treatment groups
(e.g. differing dosing regimens of light therapy), we planned to
include data for the treatment arms and to halve the data from the
placebo arm, or to collapse the data for different doses into one
group when this was clinically appropriate (Hansen 2009).
Dealing with missing data
We used intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis when data were missing
for participants who dropped out of trials before completion. We
calculated two ITT analyses: one assuming that all dropouts de-
veloped SAD, the other assuming that all dropouts stayed free of
depressive symptoms. When data regarding an outcome of interest
were not reported, we planned to contact the authors of publica-
tions to obtain missing results, as long as the study was published
over the past 20 years. We documented all correspondence with
trialists and reported responses in the full review.
Assessment of heterogeneity
We planned to use the Cochran Chi2 test (Q-test) to assess het-
erogeneity. A P value less than 0.10 is considered statistically sig-
nificant. We planned to use the I2 statistic to estimate the degree
of heterogeneity. This measure describes the percentage of total
variation across studies that results from heterogeneity rather than
from chance. We planned to interpret the importance of any het-
erogeneity in terms of its magnitude and direction of effects. We
planned to not consider thresholds; instead we intended to adopt
the overlapping bands, as suggested in the Cochrane Handbook for
Systematic Reviews of Interventions. For example, we planned to
consider an I2 value between 0% and 40% as probably not im-
portant, between 30% and 60% as representing moderate hetero-
geneity, between 50% and 90% as representing substantial hetero-
geneity and between 75% and 100% as representing considerable
heterogeneity (Higgins 2011).
Assessment of reporting biases
If we had found more than 10 studies, we planned to perform
a funnel plot analysis. A funnel plot is a graph used to detect
publication bias. We intended to look at whether the largest studies
10
Light therapy for preventing seasonal affective disorder (Review)
Copyright © 2015 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
 were near the average and small studies spread on both sides of the
average. Variations from this assumption can indicate the existence
of publication bias, but asymmetry may not necessarily be caused
by publication bias. In addition, we planned to use Kendell’s tau
(Begg 1994), Egger’s regression intercept (Egger 1997) and Fail-
Safe N (Rosenthal 1979) to assess reporting biases.
Data synthesis
We analysed data using Review Manager software (RevMan 2012).
We plannedtopool dataformeta-analysiswhenparticipantgroups
were similar, and when studies assessed the same treatments with
the same comparator and had similar definitions of outcome mea-
sures over a similar duration of treatment.
In general, we planned to use random-effects models to combine
results because we did not expect the true effect to be the same for
all included studies. We intended to also employ fixed-effect mod-
els to determine differences in treatment effects between random-
effects and fixed-effect results. Studies would have been weighted
using the Mantel-Haenszel method. We rated the strength of the
evidence using the system developed by the GRADE (Grades
of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation)
Working Group (GRADEpro 2015).
We planned to perform qualitative analysis of data on adverse ef-
fects by comparing crude rates. We planned to conduct quantita-
tive analysis of the rates of adverse effects only if we located a suffi-
cient number of prospective observational studies or randomised
trials that gathered data on adverse effects that were suitable for
pooling.
Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity
Sex, age, history of non-seasonal major depressive episodes and
psychiatric co-morbidities are potential effect measure modifiers
for prevention of SAD. Timing, duration, type and intensity of
light therapy may also modify the preventive effect on SAD. If
data were sufficient, we would have conducted subgroup analyses
for the primary outcome measures. Subgroup analyses should be
performed and interpreted with caution because multiple analyses
could lead to false-positive conclusions. We planned to conduct
subgroup analyses based on:
• men versus women;
• history of non-seasonal major depressive episodes versus no
history of non-seasonal major depressive episodes;
• younger than 65 years of age versus 65 years of age older;
and
• Axis I, Axis II co-morbidities versus no Axis I, Axis II co-
morbidities.
Sensitivity analysis
Sensitivity analyses were conducted to test the robustness of deci-
sions made during the review process.
We planned to conduct sensitivity analyses:
• excluding small studies (i.e. studies with fewer than 30
participants);
• excluding studies with high risk of bias (i.e. studies that had
been rated as high risk of bias in one or more domains);
• excluding studies published only in abstract form;
• with adjusted versus unadjusted results; and
• excluding cluster-randomised trials.
’Summary of findings’ tables
We assessed the quality of the evidence using the GRADE ap-
proach and presented the results in ’Summary of findings’ tables
for our main comparisons and outcomes (as listed in Types of
outcome measures). We did not expect to be able to stratify popu-
lations into low-, medium- or high-risk populations. For ’assumed
risk’, we used prevalence studies from countries in northern lati-
tudes (e.g. Scandinavia, Canada, northern United States) in which
SAD leads to substantial burden of disease.
We used the GRADEpro Guideline Development Tool to rate the
quality of evidence and to prepare the ’Summary of findings’ tables
(GRADEpro 2015).

views of reference lists after de-duplication of search results. We
excluded 2895 records during title and abstract reviews. We in-
cluded 91 articles for full-text review, of which one publication
met eligibility criteria for this review. We excluded most of the 91
articles because the intervention did not meet our eligibility crite-
ria; in most studies, participants already had depressive symptoms
when the therapeutic intervention was started. Our focus was on
prevention. Therefore, we included only studies that included pa-
tients with a history of SAD who were free of symptoms at the
beginning of the study. Another major reason for exclusion was
that patients had major depressive disorder rather than SAD, and
that the study design did not match our inclusion criteria (e.g.
studies without a control group). The PRISMA flow chart (Figure
1) documents the disposition of the literature in this review. Un-
der Excluded studies, we describe the reasons for excluding these
studies in greater detail.

 Included studies
We included one RCT comparing three study arms for prevention
of SAD: bright white visor light versus infrared visor light versus
no light therapy (Meesters 1999). Bio Bright, Inc., sponsored the
equipment, and study authors reported no other information on
funding. We found no non-randomised studies for assessment of
risk of harms.
In the following section, we present study characteristics and re-
sults in greater detail (see also Characteristics of included studies).
Design
The included RCT was a single-centre, non-blinded study that
was composed of two winter seasons (1993-94 and 1994-95) that
started each year in October and ended in April.
Sample size
During both winter seasons, the study included a total of 46 par-
ticipants with a history of SAD who had no depressive symptoms
when the study started. Initially, investigators had recruited 50
outpatients (30 in winter season 1993-94; 20 in winter season
1994-95); however, four developed depression between the time
of giving consent and the start of the study. Therefore, these pa-
tients were not included in the study.
Setting
The study was conducted in the Netherlands and included patients
from an outpatient clinic. The intervention was implemented at
participants’ homes.
Participants
Participants were adult outpatients with a history of SAD who had
been successfully treated with conventional light treatment in pre-
vious winter seasons. Patients were non-depressed at the start of the
study. All participants were free of drugs and were diagnosed with
SAD according to the criteria of Rosenthal et al. (Rosenthal 1984),
and in keeping with an older version (1987) of the DSM (DSM-
III-R). A total of 50 adults with a history of SAD gave consent
to participate in the study. Four developed symptoms of depres-
sion before the study started. In all, 46 participants took part in
the study and were randomly assigned to one of three study arms.
Eighteen participants were randomly assigned to bright white vi-
sor light (2500 lux); four dropped out (no information on age
or gender reported). Of the remaining 14 participants, 12 were
women with a mean age of 39.5 years (standard deviation (SD) ±
9.3), and two were men with a mean age of 41.0 years (SD ± 12.7).
Eigtheen participants were randomly assigned to the infrared vi-
sor light (0.18 lux); three dropped out (no information on age or
gender reported). Of the remaining 15 participants in the infrared
light group, 10 were women with a mean age of 36.6 years (SD ±
4.9), and five were men with a mean age of 35.4 years (SD ± 6.9).
Ten participants were randomly assigned to no light exposure; one
person dropped out (no information on age or gender reported).
Of the remaining nine patients in the no treatment group, five
were women with a mean age of 39.4 years (± 8.0), and four were
men with a mean age of 47.5 years (SD ± 7.0). Study authors
reported no other participant characteristics.
Interventions
Participants were randomly assigned to three study arms: bright
white visor light (bright light inclusive infrared light), pure in-
frared visor light (visible light filtered out) and no light exposure.
Participants in the bright white light therapy group used a bright
white visor light. Those in the infrared light group were exposed
to infrared light by means of a light visor equipped with a Kodak
Wratten filter (type 89b, 720 mm). The light visors - portable
head-mounted devices - were manufactured by Bio Bright, Inc.,
and contained two krypton incandescent bulbs. Participants used
them at home and were instructed to use them 30 minutes daily
(except on Saturdays and Sundays) between 6:00 AM and 9:00
AM. As participants used the treatment at home on their own,
they were able to choose the exact treatment time on their own
and to integrate treatments into their daily routine. Participants
in the control group received no type of light therapy (no visors
were provided) and represented a waiting list control.
Outcomes
The primary outcome reported in this study was development of
depression, according to a translated version of the Structured In-
terview Guide for the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale-Seasonal
Affective Disorders self rating version (SIGH-SAD-SR, 29-item
version) and according to the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI,
21-itemversion). Asthe primaryoutcome forthisCochrane review
was defined using SIGH-SAD (see Types of outcome measures),
we focus only on the SIGH-SAD-SR data reported. According to
SIGH-SAD-SR criteria, individuals with a score ≥ 20 were con-
sidered depressive. A secondary outcome of this Cochrane review
was severity of depression defined as “Severity of the SAD episode
or SAD-related symptoms, as measured by a validated tool (e.g.
Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (Hamilton 1960)).” Severity
is usually reported as a continuous outcome, however in the in-
cluded study it was dichotomized by the authors. Patients with
a SIGH-SAD-SR score ≥ 40 were considered severely depressed.
13

 Therefore we reported this outcome as a dichotomous outcome
in this review.
Researchers did not assess adverse events.
Excluded studies
Overall we assessed 91 studies at full-text level and excluded 90
of them. We excluded most studies because they were treatment
- not prevention - studies and/or because they focused on major
depression - not on SAD. Some studies were intended to prevent
SAD, but we had to exclude them for different reasons.
Two studies included participants with a history of SAD and in-
vestigated the preventive effects of light therapy (Meesters 1994;
Partonen 1996). We excluded these studies because they had no
control group and therefore did not meet our eligibility criteria.
Two controlled studies investigated whether starting light ther-
apy at an early stage of a depressive episode can prevent a full-
blown winter depressive episode (Meesters 1991; Meesters 1993).
We excluded these studies because participants already had de-
pressive symptoms when the study started. One study also inves-
tigated whether starting light therapy at an early stage of a depres-
sive episode can prevent a full-blown SAD; however, in this study
participants already had symptoms when the study started, and a
control group was missing (Terman 1994).
Characteristics of excluded studies show all records that narrowly
missedthe inclusioncriteriaforthissystematicreviewandmention
those studies that were included in the review on SGA (Gartlehner
2014). In the Characteristics of excluded studies section, we ex-
plain why we did not include these studies in this review.
Ongoing studies
We identified no ongoing studies of interest..
Studies awaiting classification
We found no studies currently awaiting classification.

Allocation
Study authors state that participants were randomly assigned to
treatment groups. However, they do not provide detailed infor-
mation about the randomisation scheme and do not explain how
allocation concealment was achieved. The only participant char-
acteristics reported are age and sex (only for the per-protocol pop-
ulation). Study authors do not report details on participants’ his-
tory of SAD nor on their prior experience with light therapy, so-
cioeconomic status of included participants or whether treatment
groups were similar in terms of participant characteristics.
Blinding
Participants were not blinded to type of treatment. As participants
were using a self reporting scale, they were assessing outcomes too.
Incomplete outcome data
Eight of 46 participants (17%) dropped out of the study (four in
the bright light group, three in the infrared light group and one
in the control group) and were not included in the analysis (no
ITT). Investigators reported no characteristics (e.g. age, sex) of
participants who dropped out.
Selective reporting
15

 We could not identify a protocol for this study. Therefore, we rated
this domain as unclear.
Other potential sources of bias
Participants self administered the intervention in their own homes.
Whether they used the intervention properly is unknown.

Comparison 1. Light therapy versus placebo, no
treatment or waiting list
One study including 46 participants contributed data for this
comparison (Meesters 1999). In this study, investigators compared
bright white visor light (2500 lux) (n = 18) and infrared visor
light (0.18 lux) (n = 18) with no light exposure (n = 10). Because
study authors reported only per-protocol analyses, we addition-
ally conducted two types of intention-to-treat analyses. In one, we
assumed that participants who dropped out of the study were de-
pressed; in the other, we assumed that participants who dropped
out of the study were not depressed. We chose this approach be-
cause with eight dropouts in such a small study, assumptions about
the dropouts can determine analytical results. Therefore, we de-
cided to report per-protocol results as well.
We conducted three comparisons as summarised in this section:
bright light therapy versus no light therapy, infrared light therapy
versus no light therapy and “light therapy” (both bright white light
therapy and infrared light therapy) versus no light therapy.
We did not synthesise outcomes at different time points because
data were presented only in figures and were not ready to included
in analyses.
Primary outcomes
1.1 Incidence of SAD
We defined a priori the incidence of SAD as the proportion of
participants with a SIGH-SAD score of 20 or higher.
For the first comparison, risk of developing a depressive episode
(SIGH-SAD-SR ≥ 20) was numerically smaller for participants in
the bright light group than for those in the non-treatment group.
According to the per-protocol analysis, 43% (6/14) of those in
the bright light group developed a depressive episode compared
with 67% (6/9) of participants in the non-treatment group. The
risk of developing a depressive episode during the winter was 36%
smaller for individuals in the bright light group than for those
in the non-treatment group; however, the confidence interval was
very broad, implying that with 95% confidence, the true effect lies
within 0.30 to 1.38 (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.30 to 1.38; see Analysis
1.1).
When we assumed that none of the participants who dropped out
developed a depressive episode, ITT analysis showed that 33%
(6/18) of individuals in the bright light group and 60% (6/10)
of those in the non-treatment group developed depression. The
risk of developing depression under bright light therapy was 44%
smaller than in the non-treatment group; however, the broad con-
fidence interval suggests with 95% certainty that the true effect
lies between 0.24 and 1.27 (RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.24 to 1.27; see
Analysis 1.2).
If we assumed on the other hand that all dropouts developed
depression, ITT analysis showed that 56% (10/18) of participants
in the bright light group developed depression compared with
70% (7/10) in the non-treatment group. The risk of developing
depression was 21% smaller in the bright light group than in
the non-treatment group; however, the broad confidence interval
suggests with 95% certainty a possible true value between 0.44
and 1.42 (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.44 to 1.42; see Analysis 1.3).
For the second comparison, a favourable effect of the light condi-
tion was observed in the infrared light group; however, confidence
intervals always included possible true values favouring infrared
light and favouring no treatment, no matter what type of analy-
sis we applied (per-protocol: 33% (5/15) vs 67% (6/9), RR 0.50,
95% CI 0.21 to 1.17; see Analysis 2.1; ITT with no dropouts
depressed: 28% (5/18) vs 60% (6/10), RR 0.46, 95% CI 0.19 to
1.14; see Analysis 2.2; ITT with all dropouts depressed: 44% (8/
18) vs 70% (7/10), RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.33 to 1.22; see Analysis
2.3).
For the third comparison, when we compared both types of light
therapy given to one treatment arm, we observed a numerically
favourable effect of light therapy versus no light therapy; however,
confidence intervals always included possible true values favouring
lightandnolighttherapy, nomatterifwe usedper-protocol orITT
analysis (per-protocol: 38% (11/29) vs 67% (6/9), RR 0.57, 95%
CI 0.30-1.10; see Analysis 3.1; ITT with no dropouts depressed:
31% (11/36) vs 60% (6/10), RR 0.51, 95% CI 0.25-1.03; see
Analysis 3.2; ITT with all dropouts depressed: 50% (18/36) vs
70% (7/10), RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.42-1.20; see Analysis 3.3).
1.2 Overall rate of adverse events
The included RCT reported no data on adverse events. We found
no additional eligible evidence addressing this outcome.

 Secondary outcomes
1.3 Severity of SAD or SAD-related symptoms
Forthe firstcomparison,whenwe lookedonlyatthose participants
who developed severe depression using SIGH-SAD-SR (≥ 40) as
the criterion for severe depression, the broad confidence interval
showed that the difference between bright white light therapy
and no light therapy again was not statistically significant (per-
protocol: 7% (1/14) vs 33% (3/9), RR 0.20, 95% CI 0.02 to 1.64;
see Analysis 1.4; ITT with no dropout depressed: 6% (1/18) vs
30% (3/10), RR 0.19, 95% CI 0.02 to 1.55; see Analysis 1.5; ITT
with all dropouts depressed: 28% (5/18) vs 40% (4/10), RR 0.56,
95% CI 0.18 to 1.76; see Analysis 1.6).
For the second comparison, infrared light therapy versus no light
therapy showed no statistically significant differences when we
used SIGH-SAD-SR (per-protocol: 7% (1/15) vs 33% (3/9), RR
0.20, 95% CI 0.02 to 1.64; see Analysis 2.4; ITT with no dropout
depressed: 6% (1/18) vs 30% (3/10), RR 0.19, 95% CI 0.02 to
1.55; see Analysis 2.5; ITT with all dropouts depressed: 22% (4/
18) vs 40% (4/10), RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.18 to 1.76; see Analysis
2.6).
For the third comparison, combining bright white light and in-
frared light versus “light therapy” and comparing it versus no light
therapy showed numerically favourable results for light therapy;
however, again the 95% confidence interval was very broad. In the
per-protocol analysis, the true effect could favour both light ther-
apy and no light therapy (7% (2/29) vs 33% (3/9), RR 0.21, 95%
CI 0.04 to 1.05; see Analysis 3.4). In the ITT analysis, when we
assumed that all dropouts were not depressed, the 95% CI shows
a true favourable effect of light therapy in reducing the risk of
development of a severe depressive episode (6% (2/36) vs 30% (3/
10), RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.24 to 1.61; see Analysis 3.5). However,
when we assumed that all dropouts had developed a severe episode
of depression, this was no longer the case (25% (9/36) vs 40% (4/
10), RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.22 to 1.61; see Analysis 3.6).
1.4 Quality of life
We found no eligible evidence addressing this outcome.
1.5 Quality of interpersonal and social functioning
We found no eligible evidence addressing this outcome.
1.6 Proportion of participants with serious adverse events
We found no eligible evidence addressing this outcome.
1.7 Rates of discontinuation due to adverse events
We found no eligible evidence addressing this outcome.
1.8 Overall rate of discontinuation
Eight participants dropped out during the study period (four in
the bright light group, three in the infrared light group and one
in the control group) for the following reasons: One person failed
to wear the light visor, one started to use medication, one in the
“non-treatment group” started with light therapy on her own and
five stopped because they lacked motivation to keep scoring self
rating scales when suffering from no symptoms, moving to a new
home and other reasons that study authors did not describe in
detail.
Additionally, researchers offered light treatment in the clinic to all
participants who developed severe depression (SIGH-SAD-SR ≥
40) and left the study at that moment. As this type of discontinu-
ation is part of the main outcome, we did not take it into account
when we compared discontinuation rates between groups receiv-
ing light therapy and those receiving no light therapy.
For the first comparison, four of 18 (22%) participants randomly
assigned to bright light therapy dropped out during the study
periodcomparedwith one personinthe notreatmentgroup(10%)
(RR 2.22, 95% CI 0.29 to 17.27; see Analysis 1.7).
For the second comparison, the infrared light therapy group
dropout rate was higher than that of the non-treatment group
(17% (3/18) vs 10% (1/10), RR 1.67, 95% CI 0.2 to 13.98; see
Analysis 2.7), but the difference was small and was not statistically
significant.
For the third comparison, both types of light therapy together
versus no light therapy showed that the dropout rate in the light
therapy group was numerically higher (19% (7/36) vs 10% (1/
10), RR 1.94, 95% CI 0.27 to 14.01; see Analysis 3.7).
Comparison 2. Light therapy versus other light
therapy
One study contributed data from 36 participants to this compar-
ison; 18 were randomly assigned to bright white visor light, and
18 to infrared visor light (Meesters 1999). As explained in Com-
parison 1, we reported per-protocol results as well as results de-
rived from two types of ITT analyses. In one, we assumed that
participants who dropped out of the study were depressed; in the
other, we assumed that those who dropped out of the study were
not depressed.
Primary outcomes
2.1 Incidence of SAD
In the bright light condition, the rate of participants developing
depression (SIGH-SAD-SR ≥ 20) was numerically higher than
that of participants in the infrared light therapy group; however,
confidence intervals always included possible true values favouring
light and no light therapy, no matter whether we performed per-

95% CI 0.50 to 3.28; see Analysis 4.1; ITT with no dropouts
depressed: 33% vs 28%, RR 1.20, 95% CI 0.45 to 3.23; see
Analysis 4.2; ITT with all dropouts depressed: 56% vs 44%, RR
1.25, 95% CI 0.65 to 2.42; see Analysis 4.3).
2.2 Overall rate of adverse events
We did not find any eligible evidence addressing this outcome.
Secondary outcomes
2.3 Severity of SAD or SAD-related symptoms
When we looked only at participants who developed severe de-
pression (SIGH-SAD-SR ≥ 40), we observed no differences be-
tween individuals in the bright light therapy group and those in
the infrared light therapy group - both light conditions seemed
to be similar (per-protocol: 7% vs 7%, RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.07 to
15.54; see Analysis 4.4; ITT with no dropouts depressed: 6% vs
6%, RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.07 to 14.79; see Analysis 4.5; ITT with
all dropouts depressed: 28% vs 22%, RR 1.25, 95% CI 0.40 to
3.91; see Analysis 4.6).
2.4 Quality of life
We found no eligible evidence addressing this outcome.
2.5 Quality of interpersonal and social functioning
We found no eligible evidence addressing this outcome.
2.6 Proportion of participants with serious adverse events
We found no eligible evidence addressing this outcome.
2.7 Rates of discontinuation due to adverse events
We found no eligible evidence addressing this outcome.
2.8 Overall rate of discontinuation
Discontinuation was similar in the two light therapy groups; 22%
(4/18) of participants randomly assigned to bright light therapy
dropped out during the study period compared with 17% (3/18)
of those in the infrared light therapy group (RR 1.33, 95% CI
0.35 to 5.13; see Analysis 4.7).

generation antidepressants
We found no eligible studies assessing this comparison.

agomelatine
We found no eligible studies assessing this comparison.
Comparison 5. Light therapy versus psychological

We found no eligible studies assessing this comparison.
Comparison 9. Light therapy + comparator
intervention (as listed under Types of interventions)
versus the same comparator intervention as
monotherapy (e.g. light therapy + psychological

We found no eligible studies assessing this comparison.
Subgroup analyses
Data were insufficient for subgroup analyses.
Sensitivity analyses
Data were insufficient for subgroup analyses.
Reporting bias
Aswe identifiedonlyone study, statistical approachestoassessment
of publication bias are not possible. It is unclear whether reporting
bias is a problem of the included study, as we could not identify a

Summary of main results
Overall, bright white visor light and infrared visor light numeri-
cally reduced the incidence of SAD, as well as the incidence of se-
vere SAD, as compared with no light therapy; however, 95% con-
fidence intervals were very broad and included both possible true
effects favouring light therapy and possible true effects favouring
no treatment. Comparison of both light conditions versus each
other showed no differences in SAD incidence and in the inci-
dence of severe SAD.
Overall the number of dropouts (not including those who stopped
the study because of depression) was similar between study arms.
Summary of findings for the main comparison, Summary of
findings 2, Summary of findings 3 and Summary of findings 4
show that quality of evidence for all outcomes was very low.
Overall completeness and applicability of
evidence
A major limitation of our report is that evidence is limited to one
RCT with a very small number of participants (n = 46) that is rated
as having high risk of bias in several domains. Therefore, results
of this RCT can be influenced by lack of power and by random
error.
The population included in this study that met our eligibility cri-
teria was only loosely described (age, gender); therefore, it is diffi-
cult to say whether the results can be applied to a broad spectrum
of patients who experience SAD.
As no results on adverse events were reported, we cannot estimate
potential harms of the intervention.
Quality of the evidence
We graded the quality of evidence for available efficacy outcomes
(incidence of SAD, severity of SAD, overall discontinuation) as
very low. Reasons for downgrading the quality of evidence in-
cluded high risk of bias of the included study and imprecision
due to lack of optimal information size. Other limitations of the
included study were that outcomes were self rated, compliance
throughout study duration was not checked, participant charac-
teristics were not reported comprehensively, no safety data were re-
ported (especially important because infrared light can cause such
events as eye damage) and the wavelength of infrared light used was
not specified, which is important because absorption of infrared
light in the eye depends on the wavelength (Berg 1997). We did
not downgrade for indirectness because we drew conclusions only
on the efficacy of these two special types of light therapy (bright
white visor light and infrared visor light). Drawing conclusions
about light therapy per se is not possible because different types
of administration of light therapy may lead to different results.
Potential biases in the review process
Our eligibility criteria included non-randomised studies for assess-
ment of harms because methods research indicates that rare but
potentially serious adverse events are not covered well in RCTs.
Despite extensive literature searches, we could identify no non-
randomised studies. We identified only one RCT that was pub-
lished in 1999 and did not report on adverse events. As the study
was conducted 20 years ago, we did not contact the study author
to ask for more detailed information. Other studies that investi-
gated light therapy as treatment - not as prevention - have reported
possible side effects from light therapy, including headache (13%
to 21%), eye strain or visual disturbance (19% to 27%), nausea
(7%), sweating (7%), sedation (6% to 7%) and agitation (6% to
13%) (Lam 1999). However, based on the evidence included in
this systematic review, we do not know whether light therapy as
preventive treatment is associated with side effects.
In this systematic review, we considered all types of bright white
therapy, infrared light therapy and dawn simulation therapy to be
eligible (no limitations on dosage, duration or mode of delivery)
because we wanted to base our systematic review on all available ev-
idence on preventive use of any type of light therapy. The included
study (Meesters 1999) investigated two types of light therapy that
nowadays generally are not accepted as treatment for patients with
SAD. Three studies showed that bright white light delivered by
visors is not more effective than placebo (Joffe 1993; Rosenthal
1993; Teicher 1995). Therefore, experts often do not consider vi-
sors as a legitimate light therapy intervention. This might explain
why bright white light was not more effective than no light therapy
in reducing the incidence of SAD in Meesters 1999. Nowadays,
dim red light producing only a visually negligible lux of red light is
often considered sham treatment rather than active light therapy.
This must be considered when results of the included study are
interpreted.
Finally, publication bias and selective outcomes reporting are po-
tential limitations of any systematic review. Although we searched
for grey and unpublished literature, the extent and impact of re-
porting biases of this body of evidence is impossible to determine.
Agreements and disagreements with other
studies or reviews
One uncontrolled study included participants with a history of
SAD and showed no preventive effects of light therapy on SAD
when administered before the winter season (Meesters 1994). An-
other uncontrolled study observing participants who received light
therapy before symptoms started showed a preventive effect - none
of the six individuals developed a depressive episode during the
25

 winter season, according to SIGH-SAD-SR (Partonen 1996). Two
controlled studies showed that light therapy at an early stage of
a depressive episode can prevent a full-blown winter depressive
episode (Meesters 1991; Meesters 1993). Another study showed
that treating individuals with light therapy at an early stage could
postpone a subsequent episode of SAD (Terman 1994).
We could identify no systematic reviews on the effects of light
therapy as preventive treatment for patients with a history of SAD.
A systematic review and meta-analysis of light therapy as treat-
ment for mood disorders showed that bright light therapy and
dawn simulation were efficacious in reducing the severity of SAD
symptoms (Golden 2005).
A U T H O R S ’
C O N C L U S I O N S
Implications for practice
The evidence base for light therapy as preventive treatment for
SAD in patients with a history of SAD is limited. Methodological
limitations and small sample size of the only available study pre-
cluded review author conclusions on the effects of light therapy
for SAD. Given the lack of comparative evidence, the decision for
or against initiating preventive treatment of SAD and the choice
of treatment should be based strongly on patient preferences.
Implications for research
Independently funded, high-quality studies undertaken to explic-
itly investigate the efficacy and safety of established light therapies
for the prevention of SAD, in which the research team can monitor
how the intervention is implemented, are necessary. These studies
must include a large sample (to reach at least 80% power), must
begin the intervention before the first depressive symptoms occur
and must investigate different ways of administering light ther-
apy. Investigators should also investigate the combination of light
therapy with an SGA because some psychotropic medications may
increase photosensitivity.
In this review, we have focused explicitly on prevention of SAD
in patients with a history of SAD who were free of depressive
symptoms at the start of treatment. We suggest that future research
onlighttherapyshouldinclude asystematicreviewonprophylactic
long-term effects of light therapy in individuals with SAD.

Characteristics of included studies [ordered by study ID]
Meesters 1999
Methods
Single-centre, non-blinded, randomised controlled trial (duration: 2 winter seasons
1993-94 and 1994-95, October-April each season) conducted in the Netherlands. 8
dropouts (4 bright white visor light, 3 infrared visor light, 1 no light exposure)
Participants
46 adult outpatients with a history of SAD who were without symptoms at the beginning
of the study and were free of drugs
Bright white visor light group: n = 18, but participant characteristics of only 14 partici-
pants reported: 2 men, mean age 41 years (± 12.7), 12 women, mean age 39.5 years (±
9.3)
Infrared visor light group: n = 18, but participant characteristics of only 15 participants
reported: 5 men, mean age 35.4 years (± 6.9), 10 women, mean age 36.6 years (± 4.9)
No light exposure group: n = 10, but participant characteristics of only 9 participants
reported: 4 men, mean age 47.5 years (± 7), 5 women, mean age 39.4 years (± 8)
No information about number of prior depressive episodes nor other participant char-
acteristics
Interventions
Bright white visor light (n = 18; 30 minutes/d in the morning except on weekends) vs
infrared visor light (n = 18; 30 minutes/d in the morning except on weekends) vs no
light exposure (n = 10) from October until April
Outcomes
Development of depression (BDI ≥ 13, SIGH-SAD-SR ≥ 20), development of severe
depression (BDI ≥ 22, SIGH-SAD-SR ≥ 40)

Characteristics of excluded studies [ordered by study ID]
Study
Reason for exclusion
Graw 1997
SAD participants were treated with light therapy when they suffered a depressive episode. They were inter-
viewed again 2 to 5 years later. Treatment started when participants already had depressive symptoms - not
when they were free of symptoms; therefore, the study was not relevant for this systematic review
Kasper 1988
Study included participants without depressive symptoms, but also without a history of SAD. As the study
investigated preventive effects of light therapy on healthy participants, it was not relevant for this systematic
review
Kjellman 1997
Conference abstract
Lafer 1994
Study investigated treatment - not prevention - of SAD
Meesters 1991
Study investigated whether starting light therapy at an early stage of a depressive episode can prevent a full-
blown winter depressive episode. Included participants already had depressive symptoms when the study
started; therefore, the study was not relevant for this systematic review
Meesters 1993
Study investigated whether starting light therapy at an early stage of a depressive episode can prevent a full-
blown winter depressive episode. Included participants already had depressive symptoms when the study
started; therefore, the study was not relevant for this systematic review

Meesters 1994
Study included participants with a history of SAD and investigated preventive effects of light therapy. However,
the study included only 1 intervention group and no control group, therefore, the study was not relevant for
this systematic review
Meesters 1995
Study investigated treatment - not prevention - of SAD
Most 2010
Study investigated prevention of depression and sleep disturbances in the elderly with light. Included partici-
pants in this study were diagnosed with major depressive disorder without a seasonal pattern. Therefore, the
study was not relevant for this systematic review
Norden 2000
Study investigated dawn simulation in participants with subsyndromal winter depression. Participants had no
history of SAD
Partonen 1995
Study investigated recurrence - not prevention - of SAD. Included participants already had symptoms when
the study started
Partonen 1996
Study included participants with a history of SAD and investigated preventive effects of light therapy. However,
the study included only 1 intervention group and no control group; therefore, the study was not relevant for
this systematic review
Rohan 2004
Study investigated acute and long-term efficacy of cognitive-behavioural therapy for SAD alone and in com-
bination with light therapy as compared with solo light therapy. Included participants already had symptoms
when interventions were started; therefore, the study was not relevant for this systematic review
Rohan 2007
Study investigated acute cognitive-behavioural therapy for SAD alone and in combination with light therapy
as compared with solo light therapy. This was a treatment study - not a prevention study
Rohan 2009
Study investigated recurrence of SAD after 1 year of cognitive-behavioural therapy, light therapy and a com-
bination of these. Included participants already had depressive symptoms when the study started; therefore,
it was not relevant for this systematic review
Rohan 2013
Study investigated relapse prevention of SAD and compared cognitive-behavioural therapy, light therapy and
a combination of these - not prevention of SAD. Included participants already had symptoms when the study
started
Terman 1994
Study investigated whether starting light therapy at an early stage of a depressive episode can prevent a full-
blown winter depressive episode. Included participants already had depressive symptoms when the study
started, therefore, the study was not relevant for this systematic review
Thorell 1999
Study investigated relapse prevention - not prevention of SAD. Included participants already had symptoms
when the study started
University 2014
Study investigated relapse prevention of SAD and compared cognitive-behavioural therapy, light therapy and
a combination of these - not prevention of SAD. Included participants already had symptoms when the study
started

Julia Hofmann - During the course of this review, Julia Hofmann became an employee of AstraZeneca, a pharmaceutical company
that does not produce any products relevant for the prevention or treatment of seasonal affective disorder. We would like to point out
though, that her current employment is in conflict with the Cochrane Commercial Sponsorship policy. Ms Hofmann will not take part
in any future updates of the reviews.
