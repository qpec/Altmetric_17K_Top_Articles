SUMMARY
Skeletal muscle is a major site of postprandial glucose disposal. Inadequate insulin action in 
skeletal myocytes contributes to hyperglycemia in diabetes. While glucose is known to stimulate 
insulin secretion by β cells, whether it directly engages nutrient signaling pathways in skeletal 
muscle to maintain systemic glucose homeostasis remains largely unexplored. Here we identified 
the Baf60c-Deptor-AKT pathway as a target of muscle glucose sensing that augments insulin 
action in skeletal myocytes. Genetic activation of this pathway improved postprandial glucose 
disposal in mice, whereas its muscle-specific ablation impaired insulin action and led to 
postprandial glucose intolerance. Mechanistically, glucose triggers KATP channel-dependent 
calcium signaling that promotes HDAC5 phosphorylation and nuclear exclusion, leading to 
Baf60c induction and insulin-independent AKT activation. This pathway is engaged by the anti-
diabetic drugs sulfonylureas to exert their full glucose-lowering effects. These findings uncover an

 unexpected mechanism of glucose sensing in skeletal myocytes that contributes to homeostasis 
and therapeutic action.
ETOC BLURB
Skeletal myocytes directly sense extracellular glucose concentrations and activate a signaling 
pathway to drive hormone-independent AKT activation. This glucose sensing pathway acts in 
concert with insulin to promote muscle glucose utilization and maintain systemic glucose 
homeostasis.
INTRODUCTION
Metabolic syndrome has become a global epidemic that markedly increases the risk for type 
2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. Impaired muscle 
insulin action is an early hallmark of obesity-associated metabolic disorders. Skeletal muscle 
insulin resistance has been associated with reduced mitochondrial oxidative function 
(Mootha et al., 2004; Patti et al., 2003; Petersen et al., 2003), an accumulation of 
intramyocellular lipids (Kelley et al., 2002; Samuel et al., 2010), and a shift from oxidative 
to glycolytic muscle fiber type in patients with type 2 diabetes (Lillioja et al., 1987; 
Simoneau et al., 1995; Simoneau and Kelley, 1997). These observations form the basis for 
the hypothesis that the oxidative to glycolytic shift of myofiber metabolism may be 
detrimental for muscle insulin sensitivity. However, the cause and effect relationship 
between skeletal myofiber energy metabolism and insulin sensitivity remains inconclusive 
(Muoio, 2010; Turner and Heilbronn, 2008). In fact, resistance training, which promotes the 
growth and function of fast-twitch glycolytic muscle, improves metabolic profiles in diabetic 
patients (Egan and Zierath, 2013; LeBrasseur et al., 2011). Further, genetic activation of 
glycolytic metabolism in skeletal muscle resulted in improved whole body glucose 
homeostasis in mice (Izumiya et al., 2008; Meng et al., 2013; Meng et al., 2014; Wilkes et 
al., 2009). As such, augmented glycolytic metabolism may instead represent an important 
aspect of the adaptive response in skeletal muscle when blood glucose levels are elevated.
Skeletal muscle is a major site of glucose disposal in the postprandial phase. The insulin-
sensitive glucose transporter Glut4 is responsible for the bulk of glucose clearance from the 
circulation after a meal. Insulin triggers the activation of the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway,

 which mediates the pleiotropic effects of this hormone on nutrient metabolism, including 
insulin-stimulated glucose uptake (Leto and Saltiel, 2012; Taniguchi et al., 2006). A 
canonical cell type responsible for glucose sensing in the body is the pancreatic β cells. In 
response to rising blood glucose, the ATP-sensitive potassium (KATP) channel in β cells is 
inhibited, leading to membrane depolarization, elevation of cytosolic calcium, and insulin 
secretion (Newgard and McGarry, 1995; Nichols, 2006). Previous studies have shown that 
O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) (Bond and Hanover, 2015; Erickson et al., 2013; Hardiville 
and Hart, 2014; Ruan et al., 2013), and ChREBP and MondoA together with their binding 
partner Mlx (Havula and Hietakangas, 2012; Postic et al., 2007; Uyeda and Repa, 2006) 
contribute to the transcriptional effects of glucose in diverse cell types, including skeletal 
muscle (Ahn et al., 2016; Stoltzman et al., 2008). However, whether glucose directly 
engages nutrient sensing pathways in skeletal myocytes to regulate glucose disposal remains 
largely unknown.
Skeletal myofibers are heterogeneous with regard to their contractile and metabolic 
properties. Recent work demonstrated that Baf60c, a subunit of the SWI/SNF chromatin-
remodeling complex, as a core component of a regulatory network that drives glycolytic 
metabolism in skeletal myofibers (Meng et al., 2013; Meng et al., 2014). Baf60c recruits the 
SWI/SNF complexes to specific genomic loci and activates downstream target genes 
involved in glucose metabolism. Notably, Baf60c stimulates the expression of Deptor, an 
activator of AKT (Peterson et al., 2009), and promotes glycolysis in myocytes (Meng et al., 
2014). Here, we discovered that glucose stimulates the Baf60c-Deptor-AKT signaling axis 
in skeletal myocytes through the KATP channel-dependent calcium signaling and the class 
IIa histone deacetylase HDAC5. Muscle-specific activation and ablation of this pathway in 
mice revealed a critical role of Baf60c-mediated glucose sensing in postprandial glucose 
metabolism and the extrapancreatic glucose-lowering effects of the anti-diabetic 
sulfonylurea drugs.
RESULTS
Glucose triggers the activation of the Baf60c-Deptor-AKT axis in skeletal myocytes
The Baf60 subunits endow the SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling complexes with the ability 
to orchestrate context-dependent transcriptional responses. Baf60a coordinates the programs 
of hepatic fatty acid β-oxidation and bile acid synthesis (Li et al., 2008; Meng et al., 2015), 
whereas Baf60c regulates cardiac and skeletal myogenesis (Forcales et al., 2012; Lickert et 
al., 2004; Takeuchi and Bruneau, 2009), promotes glycolytic metabolism in skeletal muscle 
(Meng et al., 2013; Meng et al., 2014), and mediates nutritional regulation of lipogenesis 
(Wang et al., 2013). In skeletal muscle, Baf60c induces the expression of Deptor, a potent 
activator of AKT, and programs myocyte energy metabolism toward glycolysis (Meng et al., 
2014). In mammals, peripheral tissues respond to nutritional and hormonal signals to fine-
tune their metabolic functions and maintain homeostasis. Whether skeletal muscle engages 
the Baf60c-Deptor-AKT axis to sense nutrients in the circulation remains unknown.
To explore whether the Baf60c pathway is responsive to nutritional and hormonal cues, we 
analyzed mRNA and protein expression of Baf60c and Deptor in skeletal muscle from ad 
lib, fasted, and refed mice. As expected, AKT phosphorylation was reduced following

 overnight starvation (Figure 1A). The mRNA and protein levels of Baf60c were significantly 
decreased in quadriceps muscle from fasted mice and recovered to the pre-fasting levels 
following 16 h of refeeding. Deptor expression also exhibited a similar pattern of regulation 
in response to feeding status. In contrast, mRNA and protein expression of Glut4, an insulin-
sensitive glucose transporter, remained largely unaltered by fasting and refeeding. To dissect 
the nutritional and hormonal signals involved, we treated differentiated C2C12 myotubes 
with factors known to fluctuate under different feeding conditions, including insulin, amino 
acids, fatty acids, and glucose. While insulin, amino acids, palmitic acid and oleic acid had 
modest effects on Baf60c expression, glucose treatment within its physiological range (4–10 
mM) elicited a robust and dose-dependent increase in mRNA and protein levels of Baf60c 
and Deptor (Figure 1B–C). In contrast, Baf60a, Baf60b, Pgc-1α, Pgc-1β, and Glut1 mRNA 
expression remained largely unaltered by glucose treatment (Figure S1A). The induction of 
Baf60c and Deptor was accompanied by robust AKT activation in treated C2C12 myotubes, 
leading to increased phosphorylation of known AKT substrates, including FoxO1, AS160, 
and GSK3β (Figure 1C). Similarly, glucose also induced the expression of Baf60c and 
Deptor and stimulated AKT activation in cultured primary human myotubes (Figure 1D). In 
contrast, glucose treatment appeared to elicit modest impacts on Baf60c and Deptor 
expression and AKT phosphorylation in cultured mouse primary hepatocytes and 
differentiated brown adipocytes (Figure S1B–C). To further establish the relevance of 
Baf60c and Deptor in skeletal muscle glucose signaling, we treated ex vivo cultured EDL 
and plantaris muscles with different concentrations of glucose. Consistent with observations 
in cultured myotubes, glucose induced the mRNA expression of Baf60c and Deptor in a 
dose-dependent manner in EDL muscles (Figure 1E). Baf60c and Deptor protein levels and 
AKT phosphorylation were also markedly elevated in response to 10 mM glucose (Figure 
1F). Glucose moderately increased Baf60c and Deptor mRNA levels in soleus muscles 
(Figure S1D), consistent with their enriched expression in glycolytic muscles (Meng et al., 
2013). Together, these results demonstrate that the Baf60c-Deptor-AKT pathway is highly 
responsive to physiological concentrations of glucose in skeletal myocytes.
Baf60c-mediated nutrient sensing acts in concert with insulin to facilitate postprandial 
glucose disposal
We next examined whether glucose-induced AKT activation contributes to increased 
expression of Baf60c and Deptor in response to glucose. We treated differentiated C2C12 
myotubes with 1 or 10 mM glucose in the absence or presence of 10 μM AKT1/2 inhibitor 
(AKTi). As expected, AKTi strongly inhibited AKT phosphorylation in treated myotubes 
(Figure 2A). Glucose-induced expression of Baf60c and Deptor remained largely unaffected 
by AKTi treatment. On the contrary, RNAi knockdown of Baf60c significantly impaired the 
induction of Deptor expression by glucose (Figure 2B). Glucose-induced AKT 
phosphorylation was also diminished in Baf60c knockdown myotubes (Figure 2C). These 
results demonstrate that AKT activation is downstream of Baf60c and Deptor following 
glucose stimulation.
We next examined whether activation of myocyte glucose sensing pathway augments the 
glycolytic metabolism of C2C12 myotubes. Pre-treatment of C2C12 myotubes with glucose 
resulted in a dose-dependent increase in glucose consumption and lactate production after

 switching to 5 mM glucose during the chase period (Figure 2D). Further, glucose treatment 
strongly increased lactate production in ex vivo cultured plantaris, EDL, and soleus muscles 
in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 2E). The induction of lactate production by glucose was 
essentially abolished by AKTi, illustrating a critical role of AKT activation in mediating the 
stimulatory effects of glucose on glycolytic metabolism in muscle (Figure 2F). To test the 
possibility that Baf60c may play a broader role in myocyte glucose sensing, we performed 
microarray analysis on control (siCtr) and Baf60c (siBaf) knockdown myotubes following 
exposure to 1 or 10 mM glucose. We identified a cluster of glucose-responsive genes; 49 
genes within this cluster required Baf60c to be fully induced by glucose (Figure 2G). As 
such, Baf60c appears to orchestrate the transcriptional response of a significant subset of 
glucose-regulated genes in skeletal myocytes.
Skeletal muscle is a major site of postprandial glucose disposal, a process mediated by 
insulin-stimulated glucose uptake. Insulin stimulates the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway and 
promotes the translocation of Glut4 to the plasma membrane of skeletal myocytes. To 
determine whether insulin and glucose cooperatively activate AKT phosphorylation, we 
treated differentiated C2C12 myotubes with 1 or 10 mM glucose in the presence of different 
concentrations of insulin. As shown in Figure 2H, insulin-stimulated AKT phosphorylation 
was significantly augmented under the high glucose conditions, suggesting that glucose may 
directly engage skeletal myocytes to promote AKT activation and augment postprandial 
glucose disposal. In support of this, high-fat diet (HFD)-fed muscle-specific Baf60c 
transgenic mice (Tg) had improved postprandial glycemic control following refeeding and 
during oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), compared to wild type (WT) littermate controls 
(Figure 2I–J). Plasma insulin concentrations during OGTT remained similar. To dissect the 
relative contribution of Baf60c- and insulin-mediated AKT activation in glucose 
metabolism, we performed fasting/refeeding studies in WT and Tg mice following 
streptozotocin (STZ) treatments. Five consecutive injections of STZ (50 mg/kg) markedly 
reduced plasma insulin levels, leading to hyperglycemia in WT mice (Figure S1E). 
Similarly, while plasma insulin levels were low in STZ-treated WT and Tg mice, Tg group 
had significantly lower blood glucose levels under ad lib conditions and following overnight 
starvation (Figure 2K). Remarkably, Tg mice developed less pronounced postprandial 
hyperglycemia than WT mice following refeeding (Figure 2L). These results illustrate that 
insulin-independent AKT activation mediated by Baf60c is sufficient to drive postprandial 
glucose disposal and homeostasis.
Glucose triggers intramyocellular calcium response through a KATP channel-dependent 
pathway
Several downstream pathways have been identified to mediate the metabolic effects of 
glucose in peripheral tissues. Glucose regulates gene expression through post-translational 
modifications of transcriptional regulators, particularly O-linked glycosylation mediated by 
O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) (Bond and Hanover, 2015; Erickson et al., 2013; Hardiville 
and Hart, 2014; Ruan et al., 2013). To test whether O-linked glycosylation plays a role in 
glucose-induced Baf60c expression and AKT activation in skeletal myocytes, we performed 
glucose treatment in C2C12 myotubes in the absence or presence of diazo-5-oxonorleucine 
(DON), an inhibitor of O-linked glycosylation, and PUGNAc and Thiamet-G, inhibitors of

 the O-GlcNAcase that removes O-GlcNAc from glycosylated proteins (Erickson et al., 2013; 
Li et al., 2013). The ability of glucose to induce Baf60c and Deptor gene expression and 
AKT phosphorylation was largely unaffected by these treatments (Figure S2A–E). Similarly, 
the induction of the Baf60c-Deptor-AKT pathway appeared to be independent of reactive 
oxygen species (Figure S2F), which contribute to the regulation of certain target genes in 
response to glucose (Inoguchi et al., 2000; Yu et al., 2011). In β cells, insulin secretion is 
stimulated in response to rising blood glucose through ATP-mediated closure of KATP 
channel and plasma membrane depolarization (Newgard and McGarry, 1995; Nichols, 
2006). Interestingly, 2-deoxy glucose (2-DG), a glucose analog that cannot be metabolized 
through the glycolytic pathway, failed to induce Baf60c and Deptor expression and AKT 
phosphorylation in C2C12 myotubes (Figure 3A–B) and in ex vivo cultured EDL muscles 
(Figure 3C–D). Similarly, lactate and pyruvate, two metabolites of the glycolytic pathway, 
and galactose, a sugar that does not produce ATP through glycolytic metabolism, had 
modest effects on the expression of Baf60c and Deptor. These findings suggest that ATP 
production through glycolysis may play an important role in myocyte glucose sensing that 
leads to activation of the Baf60c-Deptor-AKT pathway.
Similar to previous findings (Flagg et al., 2010), analysis of a microarray dataset on mouse 
tissues and cell lines indicated that skeletal muscle expresses high levels of the KATP channel 
subunits Sur2 and Kir6.2 (Figure S3A). It is plausible that glucose metabolism may increase 
intracellular ATP levels in myocytes, leading to KATP channel closure, plasma membrane 
depolarization, and calcium influx through voltage-dependent calcium channels. To test this, 
we performed calcium imaging using Fluo-4 AM, a cell permeable and sensitive calcium 
indicator. Exposure of C2C12 myotubes to 10 mM glucose, but not 2-DG, resulted in a rapid 
and robust increase in intracellular calcium levels (Figure 3E). Consistantly, treatment with 
glucose, but not other sugars or metabolites, elevated intracellular ATP concentration in 
treated myotubes (Figure 3F). Similar calcium response was observed in primary mouse 
myotubes in response to glucose (Figure 3G). In contrast, galactose and pyruvate did not 
elicit significant changes in intracellular calcium concentrations (Figure S3B–C). Diazoxide 
(DZO), a potassium channel activator, abolished the calcium response to glucose in both 
C2C12 and primary mouse myotubes. Importantly, DZO dose-dependently blocked the 
induction of Baf60c and Deptor and phosphorylation of AKT and AS160 in response to 
glucose (Figure 3H–I), suggesting that glucose-induced KATP channel closure is required for 
activation of calcium response and downstream nutrient signaling.
HDAC5 is a nuclear target of myocyte glucose sensing
Calcium signaling plays an important role in myofiber development and metabolism. In 
skeletal muscle, several kinases, including AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), protein 
kinase C and D (PKC/PKD), mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and calcium/
calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) have been identified as downstream 
effectors of calcium signaling (Bassel-Duby and Olson, 2006). We next performed glucose 
treatment in the presence of specific inhibitors for these kinases to dissect the effector of 
glucose signaling in myocytes. Remarkably, the CaMKII-specific inhibitors KN-62 and 
KN-93, dose-dependently diminished the induction of Baf60c and Deptor mRNA and 
protein expression by glucose (Figure 4A–B and S4A). Glucose-induced AKT activation

 was also markedly reduced in the presence of KN-62. In contrast, specific inhibitors of PKC/
PKD, MAPK, and AMPK had largely no effect on Baf60c and Deptor gene expression 
(Figure S4B–D). Further, adenoviral overexpression of constitutively active CaMKII, which 
exhibited calcium-independent kinase activation (Pfleiderer et al., 2004), stimulated Baf60c 
and Deptor expression in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 4C). As such, CaMKII likely 
serves as an important downstream mediator of glucose-induced calcium signaling in 
skeletal myocytes.
The class IIa HDACs, particularly HDAC4, 5, and 7, have been implicated in linking 
CaMKII activation to the transcriptional response of muscle genes (Haberland et al., 2009). 
Interestingly, treatments of C2C12 myotubes with glucose, but not lactate and galactose, 
strongly induced phosphorylation of HDAC5-S498 and HDAC5-S259/HDAC7-S155, as 
detected by antibodies that recognize these phosphorylation sites (Figure 4D). Further 
immunoblotting analyses using phosphorylation site specific antibody ruled out HDAC7-
S155 as the glucose-responsive phosphorylation site. Glucose induced a modest increase in 
HDAC4 phosphorylation on S246 residue. Phosphorylation of HDAC5 was induced within 
5–10 min in response to glucose treatment, while total HDAC5 levels remained largely 
unchanged (Figure 4E). Importantly, HDAC5 phosphorylation exhibited a strikingly similar 
pattern of regulation by feeding status as Baf60c and Deptor. Phospho-HDAC5 levels were 
significantly reduced in response to starvation and recovered to high levels following 
refeeding (Figure 4F).
HDAC5 phosphorylation serves as an important switch for its subcellular localization 
(Haberland et al., 2009; Mihaylova et al., 2011; Parra and Verdin, 2010). Unphosphorylated 
HDAC5 is primarily localized in the nucleus and undergoes nuclear to cytosolic 
translocation upon phosphorylation. We next examined whether glucose-mediated HDAC5 
phosphorylation promotes its export from the nucleus. As expected, HDAC5 is localized 
largely in the nuclear fraction and nearly undetectable in the cytosolic fraction under low 
glucose (1 mM) conditions (Figure 4G). Endogenous HDAC5, but not HDAC7, underwent a 
switch of subcellular localization from the nucleus to the cytosol in response to 10 mM 
glucose. This shift in HDAC5 localization was further confirmed using immunofluorescence 
staining of endogenous HDAC5 protein (Figure 4H). Further, KN-62 treatments diminished 
glucose-induced phosphorylation and nuclear exclusion of HDAC5 (Figure 4I–J). 
Importantly, abolishment of calcium response by the potassium channel activator DZO 
attenuated glucose-induced HDAC5 phosphorylation in a dose dependent manner (Figure 
3I). Together, these results demonstrate that glucose regulates the subcelluar localization of 
HDAC5 in myocytes in a CaMKII-dependent manner downstream of KATP channel-
mediated calcium response.
HDAC5 phosphorylation and nuclear exclusion are required for the induction of glucose-
responsive genes
We next determined whether glucose-induced nuclear exclusion of HDAC5 is associated 
with a switch of chromatin structure to a transcriptional active state. Chromatin 
immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays revealed that acetyl-histone H3 (Ace-H3) and trimethyl-
H3K4 (H3K4m3), histone marks for transcriptionally active chromatin, were augmented at

 the proximal promoters of Baf60c and Deptor in response to glucose treatment (Figure 5A–
B). Accordingly, glucose treatment significantly reduced the levels of dimethyl-H3K9 
(H3K9m2), a histone mark frequently associated with repressive chromatin, near the 
transcriptional start sites of these two genes. Enrichment of Ace-H3 at distal sites on Baf60c 
and Deptor promoters remained unaffected by glucose treatment (Figure S5). To test 
whether nuclear exclusion of HDAC5 contributes to the induction of Baf60c and Deptor by 
glucose, we knocked down HDAC5 or HDAC7 in C2C12 myotubes and performed glucose 
treatment. As shown in Figure 5C, RNAi knockdown of HDAC7 had modest effects on the 
expression of Baf60c and Deptor, while HDAC5 depletion significantly augmented the 
induction of these genes in response to 2 mM glucose. This sensitizing effect of HDAC5 
knockdown disappeared at high glucose concentrations as endogenous HDAC5 was 
excluded from the nucleus, masking the positive effects of HDAC5 depletion on gene 
expression (data not shown). These results suggest that glucose-regulated HDAC5 
phosphorylation and translocation from the nucleus to cytosol may be critical for the 
induction of glucose-responsive genes. To test this, we transduced differentiated C2C12 
myotubes with recombinant adenoviruses expressing GFP or a non-phosphorylatable 
HDAC5 mutant with serine residues at positions S259 and S498 mutated to alanine (GFP-
HDAC5-Mut). GFP-HDAC5-Mut is constitutively localized in the nucleus and failed to 
undergo nucleus to cytosol translocation following glucose treatment (Figure 5D). 
Compared to control, the induction of Baf60c and Deptor by glucose was nearly abolished in 
myotubes expressing GFP-HDAC5-Mut (Figure 5E). Together, these results strongly suggest 
that HDAC5 phosphorylation and its nuclear export are required for the activation of 
glucose-responsive genes.
Skeletal muscle-specific inactivation of Baf60c impairs glucose homeostasis
Having established Baf60c as a key target of myocyte glucose sensing, a critical question 
remains whether this pathway is required for maintaining systemic glucose homeostasis. To 
address this, we generated muscle-specific Baf60c knockout (MKO) mice by crossing 
Baf60c flox/flox mice (flox/flox) with MLC-Cre transgenic mice. MKO mice were born at 
expected Mendelian ratio and appeared indistinguishable from control littermates. 
Compared to control (flox/flox), Baf60c mRNA and protein expression was nearly absent in 
MKO mouse muscles (Figure 6A and B). In contrast, Baf60c expression in other metabolic 
tissues, including liver, adipose tissues and heart, remained similar between two groups 
(Figure S6A). Baf60c deficiency in skeletal muscle had no obvious effects on body weight 
and muscle mass in chow-fed mice (Figure S6B). In addition, body weight and liver, adipose 
tissue and muscle weights were similar between two groups following HFD feeding (Figure 
S6C). Gene expression and histological analyses indicated that muscle development remains 
largely unaffected by Baf60c inactivation in mature myocytes (Figure S6D–E). In fact, 
endurance exercise capacity was similar between control and MKO mice (Figure S6F). The 
mRNA levels of Baf60a, Baf60b, and other transcriptional factors and cofactors that regulate 
muscle metabolism, including MondoA1, MondoA2, Pgc-1α, and Pgc-1β, remained largely 
unaltered by ablation of Baf60c in skeletal myocytes. Muscle-specific Baf60c deficiency 
resulted in a significant decrease of several genes involved in glucose metabolism, including 
Deptor, Glut4, Pgk1, Pgam2, and Gpd1, whereas mRNA levels of the major subunits of 
mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation complexes were similar between control and MKO

 mice. Inactivation of Baf60c significantly impaired glucose-induced lactate production in 
plantaris, EDL, and soleus muscles cultured ex vivo (Figure 6C).
We next determined whether Baf60c-mediated glucose sensing is required for postprandial 
AKT activation in skeletal muscle and systemic glucose homeostasis. As expected, AKT 
phosphorylation was markedly stimulated in WT muscle following the fasting/refeeding 
switch (Figure 6B). Baf60c deficiency greatly impaired feeding-induced AKT activation. 
ITT and OGTT studies indicated that HFD-fed MKO mice were more insulin resistant and 
glucose intolerant than control (Figure 6D–E). Plasma insulin concentrations were similar 
between two groups during OGTT. Consistently, MKO mice had elevated postprandial blood 
glucose after refeeding (Figure 6F). Gene expression analyses revealed that muscle-specific 
inactivation of Baf60c had a modest effect on metabolic gene expression in the liver and 
adipose tissues (Figure S6G), suggesting that defective skeletal muscle glucose sensing is 
likely responsible for impaired whole body glucose metabolism in MKO mice. We further 
examined systemic glucose homeostasis under the condition of insulin deficiency. STZ-
treated MKO mice had significantly higher blood glucose levels than control despite 
similarly low levels of plasma insulin (Figure 6G). In addition, inactivation of Baf60c 
rendered MKO mice more insulin resistant and glucose intolerant (Figure 6H). Compared to 
control, MKO mice developed more severe postprandial hyperglycemia following refeeding 
(Figure 6I), as a result of diminished skeletal muscle AKT activation upon the fasting-
refeeding switch (Figure 6J). Taken together, these results strongly implicate Baf60c as a 
core component of myocyte glucose sensing that is critical for muscle glucose disposal and 
whole body glucose homeostasis.
Sulfonylurea engages the Baf60c-Deptor-AKT pathway in skeletal muscle to lower blood 
glucose
Sulfonylureas are a class of widely used anti-diabetic drugs that function through inhibiting 
the KATP channel on the plasma membrane of pancreatic β cells, leading to augmented 
insulin secretion. Previous studies have demonstrated that sulfonylureas also exerted effects 
in extra-pancreatic tissues, particularly skeletal muscle, to lower blood glucose levels 
(Chutkow et al., 2001; Greenfield et al., 1982; Miki et al., 2002; Muller et al., 1995). Given 
that the KATP channel is indispensable for glucose-induced calcium response in myocytes, 
we postulated that sulfonylureas might engage the Baf60c-Deptor-AKT pathway to regulate 
skeletal muscle glucose metabolism. To test this, we performed calcium imaging studies in 
myocytes following exposure to sulfonylureas. Tolbutamide and glibenclamide, a first- and 
second-generation sulfonylurea, respectively, induced a rapid rise of intracellular calcium in 
C2C12 and primary mouse myotubes (Figure 7A–B and Figure S7). The mRNA and protein 
expression of Baf60c and Deptor was also significantly induced by glibenclamide treatment 
in ex vivo cultured EDL muscles, leading to AKT activation (Figure 7C–D). Importantly, 
glibenclamide-induced expression of Baf60c/Deptor and phosphorylation of AKT and its 
downstream substrates (FoxO1, AS160, and GSK3β) were significantly attenuated in 
cultured EDL muscles isolated from MKO mice (Figure 7E). To examine whether Baf60c is 
required for the full glucose-lowering effect of sulfonylurea, we treated HFD-fed STZ-
treated control and MKO mice with glibenclamide through oral gavage and measured blood 
glucose and plasma insulin levels. The plasma insulin levels remained low and unaltered in

 response to glibenclamide treatment in both groups. While glibenclamide decreased blood 
glucose by approximately 30% in control mice, this glucose-lowering effect was 
significantly attenuated in MKO mice (Figure 7F). As such, the Baf60c-Deptor-AKT 
pathway serves as a molecular target downstream of sulfonylureas in skeletal muscle that is 
required for the full glucose-lowering effects of sulfonylurea drugs.
DISCUSSION
Skeletal muscle is a major site of postprandial glucose disposal through insulin-stimulated 
glucose uptake. Central to this dogma is that insulin activates the PI3K-AKT pathway, 
leading to Glut4 translocation and glucose uptake. Whether glucose itself is capable of 
triggering adaptive metabolic responses in skeletal myocytes to promote glucose clearance 
and contribute to systemic homeostasis is largely unknown. In this study, we identified the 
Baf60c-Deptor-AKT signaling pathway as a target of myocyte glucose sensing that 
augments muscle insulin action. Similar to β cells, skeletal myocytes actively respond to 
glucose by triggering a rapid rise of intracellular calcium, leading to activation of CaMKII, 
phosphorylation and nuclear exclusion of HDAC5, and induction of Baf60c and Deptor in a 
cell-autonomous manner. The engagement of this nutrient sensing pathway results in 
glucose-stimulated AKT activation that acts in concert with insulin to promote muscle 
glucose uptake. As such, muscle-specific transgenic activation of this pathway improved 
postprandial glucose clearance, whereas its deficiency impaired insulin action, leading to 
glucose intolerance. Our data provide evidence for the existence of a myocyte-intrinsic 
glucose sensing pathway that is coupled to the insulin signaling pathway to function as a 
rheostat in maintaining steady blood glucose levels.
In mammals, circulating glucose is sensed by diverse cell types in the body. A notable 
example is the pancreatic β cells, which increase insulin secretion in response to rising blood 
glucose levels. A subset of hypothalamic neurons also exhibits glucose-responsiveness and 
contributes to glucose homeostasis through modulating autonomic nervous activity (Chan 
and Sherwin, 2013; Kong et al., 2010; Steinbusch et al., 2015). Distinct molecular 
mechanisms have been implicated in linking extracellular glucose levels to biological 
responses in the cell (Efeyan et al., 2015; Erickson et al., 2013; Hardiville and Hart, 2014; 
Havula and Hietakangas, 2012; Ruan et al., 2013; Uyeda and Repa, 2006). An intriguing 
aspect of muscle glucose sensing is that the core molecular apparatus responsible for β cell 
glucose sensing is also engaged in myocytes. Glucose induced a rapid and robust increase in 
intracellular calcium levels in myotubes. In fact, pretreatments of myotubes with DZO, a 
KATP channel opener, completely abolished glucose-induced calcium response, suggesting 
that the KATP channel acts upstream of Baf60c. Remarkably, exposure of myotubes to 
tolbutamide and glibenclamide induced a strong calcium response and was sufficient to 
trigger the expression of Baf60c and Deptor, and AKT activation. The sulfonylurea drugs 
have been demonstrated to act on extrapancreatic tissues to exert the full blood glucose-
lowering effects (Chutkow et al., 2001; Greenfield et al., 1982; Miki et al., 2002; Muller et 
al., 1995). Our findings demonstrated that the Baf60c-mediated glucose sensing pathway 
may serve as an important target of sulfonylureas in skeletal muscle.

 Calcium plays an important role in orchestrating many aspects of muscle biology. A major 
target here is the activation of CaMKII, which is required for transducing the stimulatory 
effects of glucose on Baf60c and Deptor expression and AKT activation. CaMKII 
phosphorylates the class IIa histone deacetylase HDAC5 and promotes it translocation from 
nucleus to cytosol in response to glucose. This phosphorylation-dependent switch of the 
subcellular localization of HDAC5 has been previously implicated in skeletal muscle 
development and the regulation of hepatic metabolism (Haberland et al., 2009; McKinsey et 
al., 2000; Mihaylova and Shaw, 2013; Mihaylova et al., 2011). In the context of glucose 
sensing, we found that HDAC5 is exquisitely critical for transcriptional regulation of Baf60c 
and Deptor. RNAi knockdown of HDAC5 sensitizes the transcriptional response to glucose, 
whereas overexpression of a HDAC5 mutant lacking two CaMKII phosphorylation sites 
severely dampened the induction of glucose-responsive genes in myotubes. These studies 
established a novel molecular pathway that links extracellular glucose levels to the myocyte 
transcriptional program and AKT activation.
The expression of Baf60c and Deptor in skeletal muscle is elevated under fed conditions, 
suggesting that this pathway may be engaged during the postprandial phase to modulate 
glucose disposal. In support of this, muscle-specific Baf60c transgenic mice had improved 
glycemic control following the fasting/refeeding switch, even when insulin secretion was 
diminished by STZ treatments. In fact, this insulin deficiency model revealed a prominent 
role of Baf60c-mediated glucose sensing pathway in promoting postprandial glucose 
disposal. On the contrary, mice with muscle-specific deficiency of Baf60c had significantly 
reduced Deptor expression and lower AKT phosphorylation compared to control mice. 
MKO mice developed more severe insulin resistance and glucose intolerance following 
HFD-feeding, suggesting that the Baf60c-Deptor-AKT pathway is engaged in metabolic 
stress conditions to restore glucose homeostasis. Its deficiency compromised the ability of 
insulin to fully activate AKT and promote glucose uptake. Similarly, under the conditions of 
STZ-induced insulin deficiency, MKO mice developed more pronounced postprandial 
hyperglycemia. Finally, Baf60c appeared to be required for mediating the extrapancreatic 
action of sulfonylureas in lowering blood glucose. Taken together, this work illustrates a new 
nutrient sensing pathway underlying glucose-induced glucose disposal in skeletal muscle 
that serves a critical role in whole body glucose homeostasis.

EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND SUBJECT DETAILS
Animal model—MCK-Baf60c mice have been described previously (Meng et al., 2013). 
For the generation of Baf60c muscle specific knockout (MKO) mice, a targeting vector that 
carries two loxP sites flanking exon 2 of mouse Baf60c gene was constructed using BAC 
recombineering. C57BL/6J ES cell line (Bruce 4) from Transgenic Animal Model Core at 
the University of Michigan was chosen for homologous recombination to facilitate breeding

 into C57BL/6J genetic background for metabolic studies. Transgenic mice expressing the 
Cre recombinase driven by the skeletal muscle specific myosin light chain promoter (MLC-
Cre) (Bothe et al., 2000) were used to cross with Baf60c flox/flox mice to achieve muscle 
specific deletion of Baf60c. Mice were maintained in 12/12 h light/dark cycles and fed 
normal rodent chow or high-fat diet (D12492, Research Diets). Male mice of 2–8 months of 
age were used. Littermates were randomly assigned to experimental groups. All animal 
studies were performed according to procedures approved by the Institutional Animal Care 
and Use Committee at the University of Michigan.
Muscle cell culture, retroviral transduction and differentiation—C2C12 
myoblasts were obtained from ATCC and cultured in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine 
serum. Pooled primary human skeletal myoblasts isolated from three healthy adult donors 
were purchased from Zen-Bio (Research Triangle Park, NC) and maintained in skeletal 
muscle growth medium (SKM-M, Zen-Bio). Cells were cultured at 37°C in a humidified 
atmosph ere containing 95% air and 5% CO2. Both cells have been used in multiple 
previous publications and further confirmed by the differentiation assays. For the 
establishment of C2C12 stable cell lines, myoblasts were transduced with retroviruses 
expressing vector alone or Baf60c, or retroviruses expressing control shRNA or shRNAs 
targeting Baf60c (Meng et al., 2013), HDAC5 and HDAC7 (Mihaylova et al., 2011), and 
subjected to puromycin selection for 3 days. Myotube differentiation was initiated by 
switching confluent C2C12 or primary human myoblasts to DMEM containing 2% bovine 
growth serum or skeletal muscle differentiation medium (SKM-D, Zen-Bio), respectively. 
All studies were performed in differentiated myotubes.
METHOD DETAILS
Overall experimental design—For in vitro cell culture experiments, three or more 
independent experiments were performed and each with three or more replicates. For animal 
experiments, the gender and age of animals were matched. The sample size was determined 
based on generally expected variations of metabolic parameters and typical sample size for 
metabolic studies documented in the literature. No statistical method was used to 
predetermine sample size. The experiments were not randomized and the investigators were 
not blinded to allocation during experiments and outcome assessment. All of the 
experiments were repeated three or more independent times with similar results. Images 
shown are representative of the images obtained from three independent experiments.
Mouse STZ treatment—For the STZ treatments, STZ (Cayman) was prepared freshly in 
sodium citric buffer (pH 4.2) and administrated to mice through intraperitoneal (IP) injection 
at 50 mg/kg body weight for consecutive five days.
ITT and GTT—ITT and GTT were performed as previously described (Meng et al., 2013; 
Wang et al., 2014). For GTT, mice were fasted overnight (16 h) and IP injected with a 
glucose solution (20% prepared in saline) at 2 g/kg body weight. Blood glucose 
concentrations were measured before and 15, 30, 60, and 120 min after glucose injection. 
For ITT, mice were fasted for 4 h and IP injected with insulin at 1 U/kg. Blood glucose 
levels were measured before and 15, 30, 60, and 120 min after insulin injection.

 Glucose consumption and lactate production assays—Glucose consumption and 
lactate production assay in differentiated C2C12 myotubes were performed as previously 
described (Meng et al., 2013). Briefly, Cells grown in 6-well plates were glucose deprived in 
glucose free DMEM (Gibco, 11966) containing 0.1% BSA and 1 mM glucose for 12 h. 
Then, cells were treated with fresh glucose free DMEM plus 0.1% BSA and certain 
concentrations of glucose for 24 h. At the end of the treatment, culture medium was replaced 
with glucose free DMEM plus 0.1% BSA and 5 mM glucose. At 1 h, 2 h, 4 h, 8 h, 12 h and 
24 h after incubation, 50 ul of culture medium was collected from each well and frozen in 
−80°C for fu ture lactate and glucose measurements using Lactic acid assay kit (K-LATE, 
Megazyme International Ireland Ltd.) and Glucose assay kit (GAGO-20, Sigma), 
respectively. For ex vivo culture, intact plantaris, soleus, and EDL muscles were dissected 
from male flox/flox and MKO mice, and subjected to different concentrations of gluocse 
treatment for 4 h. At the end of the treatment, culture medium was replaced with glucose 
free DMEM plus 0.1% BSA and 5 mM glucose. At 1 h, 2 h, 3 h after incubation, 50 ul of 
culture medium was collected for future lactate and glucose measurements.
Intracellular calcium imaging—C2C12 or primary mouse myoblasts were seeded and 
differentiated into myotubes in 35 mm glass bottom dishes (MatTek Corporation). Cells 
were pre-treated with 1 mM glucose for 12 h before loading with calcium indicator Fluo-4 
AM (Thermo Fisher) and imaging with inverted fluorescent microscope. Images were 
acquired every other second to monitor the dynamic changes in intracellular calcium levels 
in response to different treatments.
ChIP assay—ChIP assay was performed according to the protocol developed by Upstate 
Biotechnology as described (Meng et al., 2013). Briefly, treated myotubes were fixed with 
1% formaldehyde and sonicated to produce chromatin lysates. The lysates were pre-cleared 
with Protein-G agarose beads and immunoprecipitated overnight with antibodies against 
Ace-H3 (Millipore, 06–599), H3K4m3 (Millipore, 07–473), H3K9m2 (Abcam, ab1220), or 
control IgG in the presence of BSA and salmon sperm DNA. The next day, Protein-G 
agarose beads were added to each immunoprecipitation reaction for 1 h, followed by 
extensively wash and reverse crosslink. DNA was eluted from the beads and purified using a 
PCR Purification Kit (Invitrogen) and subsequently analyzed by qPCR using primers located 
on the proximal promoter regions of mouse Baf60c and Deptor genes (Table S1).
Gene expression analyses—TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies) was used to extract 
total RNA from tissues and cultured cells. Gene expression analyses were performed using 
SYBR Green reagent (Life Technologies). Relative abundance of mRNA was normalized to 
ribosomal protein 36B4. qPCR primers are listed in Table S2.
Western blot analyses—Total protein extracts were prepared using a lysis buffer 
containing 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH=7.5), 137 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 10% 
glycerol, 10 mM NaF, 10 mM Na4P2O7, 1 mM Na3VO4, and protease inhibitor cocktail 
(Roche). Cytosolic and nuclear fractions were prepared as previously described (Meng et al., 
2014). Protein extracts were separated by SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to a 
polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore), followed by immunoblotting with the

44-1071G) was from Thermo Fisher.
Immunofluorescence—To study the translocation of endogenous HDAC5 in response to 
glucose treatment, C2C12 myotubes cultured and differentiated on glass coverslips in 6-well 
plates were pretreated with glucose free DMEM plus 1 mM glucose and 0.1% BSA for 12 
hr, followed by treatment with 1 mM or 10 mM glucose for 2 hr. Myotubes were washed 
once with PBS, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde on ice for 10min, permeabilized with 0.3% 
Triton X-100 for 10 min, and blocked with 5% BSA in TBST at room temperature for 1 hr, 
followed by incubation with rabbit anti HDAC5 antibody (1:200, Abcam ab1439) in 5% 
BSA in TBST at 4°C overnight. The next day, myotubes were wash three times with PBS, 
incubated with Alexa Fluor® 488 conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (H+L) secondary antibody 
(1:1,000, Invitrogen A11034) at room temperature for 1 hr, washed three times with PBS, 
and stained with DAPI for nuclei for 5 min. Coverslips were then mounted using 
VECTASHIELD Mounting Medium (Vector Laboratories), and images were captured using 
an Olympus confocal microscope. To study the intracellular localization of GFP-HDAC5 
S259A/S498A mutant, C2C12 myotubes cultured and differentiated on glass coverslips in 6-
well plates were transduced with recombinant adenovirus expressing GFP-HDAC5 S259A/
S498A mutant. The following procedures were the same as described above except for the 
GFP-HDAC5 S259A/S498A mutant protein could be directly visualized by the confocal 
microscope. Therefore, after fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde, the myotubes on 
coverslips were washed three times with PBS and stained with DAPI for 5 min, followed by 
mounting and confocal imaging.
QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Statistical analyses were carried out using GraphPad Prism 7. Statistical differences were 
evaluated using two-tailed unpaired Student’s t-test for comparisons between two groups, or 
analysis of variance (ANOVA) and appropriate post hoc analyses for comparisons of more 
than two groups. For ITT, GTT, OGTT, and fasting/refeeding blood glucose studies, two-
way ANOVA with multiple comparisons was used for statistical analysis. Further, area under 
curve (AUC) was calculated for each mouse and evaluated by two-tailed unpaired Student’s 
t-test for statistical differences between two genotypes. A p value of less than 0.05 (*p < 
0.05, **p < 0.01, and ***p < 0.001) was considered statistically significant. Statistical
