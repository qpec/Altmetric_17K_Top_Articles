benzodiazepines and overdose: retrospective analysis
Eric C Sun,1 Anjali Dixit,2 Keith Humphreys,3 Beth D Darnall,1 Laurence C Baker,4 Sean Mackey1 
ABSTRACT
ObjeCtives
To identify trends in concurrent use of a 
benzodiazepine and an opioid and to identify the 
impact of these trends on admissions to hospital and 
emergency room visits for opioid overdose.
Design
Retrospective analysis of claims data, 2001-13.
setting
Administrative health claims database.
PartiCiPants
315 428 privately insured people aged 18-64 who were 
continuously enrolled in a health plan with medical 
and pharmacy benefits during the study period and 
who also filled at least one prescription for an opioid.
interventiOns
Concurrent benzodiazepine/opioid use, defined as an 
overlap of at least one day in the time periods covered 
by prescriptions for each drug. 
Main OutCOMe Measures
Annual percentage of opioid users with concurrent 
benzodiazepine use; annual incidence of visits to 
emergency room and inpatient admissions for opioid 
overdose.
results
9% of opioid users also used a benzodiazepine in 
2001, increasing to 17% in 2013 (80% relative 
increase). This increase was driven mainly by increases 
among intermittent, as opposed to chronic, opioid 
users. Compared with opioid users who did not use 
benzodiazepines, concurrent use of both drugs was 
associated with an increased risk of an emergency 
room visit or inpatient admission for opioid overdose 
(adjusted odds ratio 2.14, 95% confidence interval 
2.05 to 2.24; P<0.001) among all opioid users. The 
adjusted odds ratio for an emergency room visit or 
inpatient admission for opioid overdose was 1.42 (1.33 
to 1.51; P<0.001) for intermittent opioid users and 1.81 
(1.67 to 1.96; P<0.001) chronic opioid users. If this 
association is causal, elimination of concurrent 
benzodiazepine/opioid use could reduce the risk of 
emergency room visits related to opioid use and 
inpatient admissions for opioid overdose by an 
estimated 15% (95% confidence interval 14 to 16).
COnClusiOns
From 2001 to 2013, concurrent benzodiazepine/opioid 
use sharply increased in a large sample of privately 
insured patients in the US and significantly contributed 
to the overall population risk of opioid overdose.
Introduction
In the US, the increased use of prescription opioids and 
the resulting potential for addiction and overdose 
impose substantial public burden of morbidity, mortal-
ity, and economic costs.1 2  Opioid prescriptions have 
increased sharply—nearly threefold—over the past fif-
teen years,3  with a concurrent increase in opioid related 
overdoses and deaths.3 
4 
5  As a result, policymakers and 
researchers have expended considerable effort towards 
finding ways to reduce the misuse of, and overdose 
from, opioids.6-15
Nearly 30% of fatal “opioid” overdoses also involve 
benzodiazepines, which are often used concurrently 
with opioids,16-18  raising the possibility that some of the 
increase in opioid related deaths could be caused by 
increases in concurrent benzodiazepine/opioid use over 
time. Although benzodiazepines have received less pub-
lic safety attention than opioids, the combination of the 
two drugs is dangerous because benzodiazepines poten-
tiate the respiratory depressant effects of opioids.19 
 
Indeed, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 
recently released a “black box” caution, warning 
patients and providers about the potential risks of com-
bined use. Understanding the degree to which concur-
rent benzodiazepine/opioid use has increased over time, 
as well as the magnitude of its potential adverse effects, 
could have important implications for policy and clinical 
practice. These concerns are particularly salient in the 
US, but there is also some evidence of high rates of con-
current use internationally. For example, one study 
found that 47% of patients in methadone treatment pro-
grams in Spain also used  
benzodiazepines,20  while a 
another study reported that nearly 52% of Swiss patients 
in methadone treatment programs were “regular” benzo-
diazepine users.21  Studies have also found high rates of 
benzodiazepine use among heroin users in Australia.22

2
A recent study examined the incidence of opioid and 
benzodiazepine use among the subset of the veteran 
population who receives care from the Veterans Health 
Administration (VHA). Nearly 30% of VHA patients who 
were prescribed opioids also received a concurrent pre-
scription for benzodiazepines, defined as having at 
least one day’s overlap between a benzodiazepine and 
opioid prescription in a given calendar year.24 
25  More-
over, this study found that co-prescribing was associ-
ated with a significantly higher risk of death than with 
the use of opioids alone. Similar results were found in 
studies examining opioid prescriptions in North 
 
Carolina26  and in Ontario, Canada.27
As prescribing behaviors are likely to vary nationally 
and across clinical settings,28 
29  however, the applicability 
of these findings to the broader population (including to 
veterans, most of whom do not access VHA care) is 
unclear. For example, compared with the general popula-
tion, veterans in the US have a higher prevalence of sub-
stance misuse and mental health disorders.30-32 We 
focused on concurrent benzodiazepine/opioid use in a 
privately insured population broadly representative of the 
entire US, in whom concurrent use was defined as one 
day of overlap in the time periods covered by each pre-
scription. We have built on previous work by focusing on 
trends in concurrent benzodiazepine/opioid use over 
time and their effects on population health, which has 
not been fully characterized. Using a large dataset of 
administrative health claims data, we explored trends in 
concurrent use in 2001-13. In addition, we examined the 
degree to which patients using these two prescribed drugs 
have an increased risk of an emergency room visit or inpa-
tient admission for opioid overdose. Finally, we examined 
the degree to which reducing concurrent use could reduce 
the risk of emergency room visits and inpatient admis-
sions for opioid overdose at the population level.
Methods
Data
We obtained a sample of administrative health claims 
provided by Marketscan (Truven Health Analytics, Ann 
Arbor, MI). Marketscan provides patient level data on 
use and expenditures for the care of patients enrolled in 
private insurance plans through a participating 
employer, health plan, or government organization. 
The database has grown from six million beneficiaries 
to comprise over 35 million beneficiaries today. Com-
pared with the general US population, the Marketscan 
population includes more women, is more likely to 
come from the southern areas of the US, and is less 
likely to be drawn from the western areas of the US.33 
 
The data are frequently used in analyses of healthcare 
use and spending.34-37 Our data include all claims from 
1 January 2001 to 31 December 2013, inclusive. As we 
used de-identified patient data, institutional review 
board approval was not required.
The information on inpatient and outpatient data 
claims provided details from specific encounters, 
including diagnosis codes (ICD-9 (international classi-
fication of diseases, ninth edition)), procedure codes 
(current procedural terminology, CPT), and date of 
 
service provision. For the pharmacy claims data, the 
information provided includes fill date, quantity sup-
plied, and number of days supplied. The data also pro-
vide the National Drug Code, which can be linked to Red 
Book data (Truven Health Analytics, Ann Arbor, MI) to 
obtain the generic name and dose of the prescribed drug.
sample
Our initial sample consisted of the 595 410 patients who 
were continuously enrolled in a plan with medical and 
pharmaceutical benefits from 1 January 2001 to 31 
December 2013. We restricted our analysis to patients 
who were continuously enrolled during the study 
period because, as noted above, the set of employers 
and health plans contributing data to Marketscan has 
markedly increased over time, leading to a large 
increase in the number of people in the database. Our 
approach thus reduces the risk of confounding that 
might occur because of changes over time in the under-
lying population reporting data to Marketscan.
From this sample, we identified and excluded patients 
with a history of cancer or those who received a diagnosis 
of cancer during the study period (n=28 780) as well as 
those aged under 18 or over 64 when they first entered 
the study (n=142 789), giving a sample of 423 841 patients. 
Our final sample was the subset of patients (315 428) who 
filled at least one prescription for an opioid during the 
study period. A flow diagram (fig A) describing the con-
struction of our sample is in the appendix.
Outcomes
Our primary outcome was an emergency room visit or 
inpatient admission for opioid overdose within a given 
calendar year. Using methods described elsewhere,38 
we defined opioid overdose to be an admission or visit 
with ICD-9 codes indicating either opioid related poi-
soning or a potential opioid related adverse event (such 
as respiratory depression) and an ICD-9 code corre-
sponding to opioid overdose. For each opioid prescrip-
tion, we defined a time interval starting the day the 
prescription was filled and lasting the number of days 
supplied in the prescription. We counted visits only if 
they occurred during this time interval or within seven 
days after the end of this interval. For example, if a 
patient received an opioid prescription on 1 January 
2007 with 10 days’ supply, we counted only visits that 
occurred between 1 January 2007 and 17 January 2007
. 
In our sensitivity analyses we considered alternative 
definitions, such as visits occurring within 30 days of 
the time interval previously described.
variables
Our key independent variable of interest was whether an 
opioid user also used a benzodiazepine concurrently 
within a given calendar year. First, we identified opioid 
use by isolating all prescriptions for outpatient opioids 
(table A in appendix), excluding prescriptions contain-
ing hydrocodone in a cough/cold formulation. We then 
isolated all prescriptions for a benzodiazepine (table B 
in appendix) and directly examined the degree of tem-
poral overlap between prescriptions among individuals

who filled a prescription for both classes of drugs. Spe-
cifically, for each opioid prescription, we defined an 
interval in which the prescription took effect as the inter-
val starting on the day the prescription was filled and 
lasting up to the number of day’s supply provided in the 
prescription. We defined a similar interval for a benzodi-
azepine prescription and quantified the total number of 
opioid prescription days that overlapped with a benzo-
diazepine prescription days. For example, suppose a 
given patient filled an opioid prescription and received a 
30 day supply on 1 January 2001. If the same individual 
filled a benzodiazepine prescription on 20 January 2001 
with 30 days’ supply, then 11 out of the 30 days of the 
opioid prescription overlapped with a benzodiazepine 
prescription. For our baseline analyses, we defined con-
current use as having at least one day of overlap in a 
given calendar year,24 
39 in line with previous studies. We 
also considered alternative definitions of concurrent 
opioid/baseline in our sensitivity analyses.
Our analysis included several controls for patients’ 
demographics and health. Age and sex were directly 
obtained from the claims data. ICD-9 diagnosis codes 
were used to control for comorbidities including diabe-
tes mellitus and congestive heart failure (table 1  pro-
vides a full list of comorbidities).40 For each 
comorbidity, we identified the earliest year with at least 
two claims containing the associated ICD-9 codes (table 
B in appendix) and defined the patient as having a his-
tory of the given comorbidity from that year onwards. 
Finally, we also controlled for total healthcare spending 
in the time period before the first opioid prescription in 
a given year. To do so, we isolated all pharmacy, inpa-
tient, and outpatient claims submitted before the earli-
est opioid prescription in a given year. We then summed 
the spending across all these claims and divided by the 
number of calendar days in the interval between 1 Jan-
uary of the given year and the date of the earliest opioid 
prescription.
analyses
We first calculated the annual percentage of opioid 
users with concurrent benzodiazepine use. We strati-
fied our analysis by intermittent and chronic opioid 
users. Following previous work,10 chronic users were 
defined as patients who filled more than 10 prescrip-
tions or had more than 120 days’ supply in a given year, 
with the remaining opioid users being defined as inter-
mittent users. Because our study sample consisted of 
patients who were continuously enrolled during the 
study period, the average age of our population 
increased by one year annually. Therefore, we calcu-
lated age adjusted estimates using methods described 
in the appendix.
We then used multivariate logistic regression to esti-
mate the association between concurrent benzodiaze-
pine/opioid use and opioid overdose among opioid 
users. The dependent variable in this regression was an 
indicator variable that equaled 1 if the patient had at 
least one emergency room visit or admission for opioid 
overdose (using the methods described above) in the 
given calendar year and 0 otherwise. Our independent 
variable of interest was an indicator variable that 
equaled 1 if the opioid user met the criteria for concur-
rent benzodiazepine use in the given year and 0 other-
wise. We also included controls for age, year, and the 
set of additional variables in table 1.
Finally, we calculated the population attributable 
fraction (PAF) of concurrent benzodiazepine/opioid use 
to the risk of opioid overdose. This fraction represents 
the relative risk reduction for a given event at the popu-
lation level under a counterfactual scenario for a specific 
risk factor. For example, the population attributable 
fraction has been used to describe the degree to which 
low birth weight would be reduced if maternal smoking 
could be eliminated entirely.41  In our case, we calculated 
the population level risk reduction that would occur if 
concurrent benzodiazepine/opioid use could be

eliminated entirely. These estimates were calculated by 
using the results from the logistic  
analyses described 
above, following methods described elsewhere.42 
43
Because the unit of observation in our data is a per-
son year, patients will contribute multiple observations 
if they used opioids in more than one calendar year. We 
therefore adjusted our standard errors for clustering at 
the patient level.44 All analyses were performed with 
Stata 14.0 (College Station, TX).
sensitivity analyses
We conducted several sets of sensitivity analyses. First, 
in our baseline analyses we defined concurrent benzodi-
azepine/opioid overdose as requiring at least one day of 
overlap; we considered an alternative (stricter) defini-
tion that required 25% of the days’ supply of opioids to 
overlap with a benzodiazepine prescription. Similarly, 
our baseline analyses defined an opioid overdose as an 
emergency room visit or admission occurring during the 
time interval covered by an opioid prescription or within 
seven days after the end of the prescription; we consid-
ered alternative definitions that both loosened (allowing 
a visit to occur within 30 days after the time interval cov-
ered by an opioid prescription) and tightened (requiring 
the visit to occur exactly during the interval covered by 
an opioid prescription) this  
criterion.
Second, a potential issue arises because our sample 
was constructed as a set of individuals who were con-
tinuously enrolled between 2001 and 2013. The advan-
tage of this approach is that allows us to follow a 
uniform set of people over time. By contrast, other 
approaches—such as including all patients regardless 
of enrollment duration—would have the drawback of 
having to deal with a changing population over time as 
people enter and exit the sample. Restriction to people 
who did not leave the sample (because of death or loss 
of employment), however, could lead to bias because 
people who die (or lose employment) secondary to opi-
oid use would probably have experienced a series of 
emergency room visits or inpatient admissions for opi-
oid overdose before the actual event. To the degree that 
the concurrent benzodiazepine/opioid use increases 
the risk of these events (and of attrition), our approach 
will therefore underestimate the true effect of 
 
concurrent use (as our sample is limited to people who 
did experience these events, but not enough to result in 
death or loss of employment). To deal with this, we con-
ducted a secondary analysis using a broader sample 
consisting of all people who were continuously enrolled 
for at least two years (n=3 810 747). Each individual 
remained in the sample until the study end date or until 
they exited the sample. Thus, this broader sample 
includes our original sample as well as patients who 
subsequently entered and exited the sample.
Finally, one potential source of bias is that opioid 
users who concurrently used benzodiazepines could 
differ from those who did not. We performed a residual 
confounding analysis45 46  to investigate the extent to 
which our results could be explained by other 
 
unobservable factors, such as differences in health sta-
tus between the two groups. Specifically, we assumed 
the presence of an unmeasured binary confounder that 
was patient specific and independent of our measured 
confounders. We assumed that this confounder had a 
prevalence of 75% among our surgical sample and 0% 
among the non-surgical patients. The assumed differ-
ence in prevalence between surgical and non-surgical 
patients of this unmeasured confounder is much larger 
than the difference in prevalence for all the medical 
comorbidities we examined. Using methods described 
elsewhere, we then estimated the degree of confound-
ing that would be necessary for this confounder to elim-
inate the estimated association between opioid 
overdose and concurrent benzodiazepine/opioid use.46
Patient involvement
No patients were involved in setting the research ques-
tion or the outcome measures, nor were they involved in 
developing plans for design or implementation of the 
study. No patients were asked to advise on interpreta-
tion or writing up of results. There are no plans to dis-
seminate the results of the research to study participants 
or the relevant patient community.
Results
Table 1 shows descriptive statistics for patients who 
filled at least one prescription for an opioid during the 
year, stratified by whether those patients also filled at 
least one prescription for a benzodiazepine. Among opi-
oid users, patients who also filled a prescription for a 
benzodiazepine were older (44.5 v 42.4, P<0.001) and 
less likely to be men (35% v 43%, P<0.001) compared 
with those who did not. In addition, the prevalence of 
every comorbidity examined was significantly higher 
(P<0.001) among opioid users who also filled prescrip-
tions for a benzodiazepine. Given our large sample size, 
we are likely to find many differences between the two 
groups that are small in magnitude but nonetheless sig-
nificant. We therefore calculated the standardized differ-
ence between the two groups using Hedge’s g (table 1). 
Overall, the differences between the two groups for most 
of the characteristics were of modest magnitude (<0.2 
SD), with the exception of depression (roughly 0.5 SD).
The proportion of opioid users who were co-prescribed 
benzodiazepines nearly doubled from 9% (5425/53 389) in 
2001 to 17% (14 415/85 617) in 2013 (fig 1). Most of this 
growth occurred among intermittent opioid users, in 
whom the percentage of patients who also used a benzo-
diazepine increased from 7% (4122/55 960) to 13% 
(9292/65 114) during the study period. By contrast, 
although a higher percentage (46%; 1596/3457) of chronic 
opioid users also used benzodiazepines in 2001, this per-
centage remained fairly constant during the study period.
Among all opioid users who did not use benzodiaze-
pines, the age adjusted incidence of emergency room 
visits or inpatient admissions for opioid overdose 
increased from 1.08% (95% confidence interval 0.99% 
to 1.16%) in 2001 to 1.35% (1.26% to 1.43%) from 2001 to 
2013 (fig 2 ). For intermittent opioid users who did use 
not benzodiazepines, the age adjusted incidence of opi-
oid overdose increased from 1.05% (0.96% to 1.14%) to 
1.15% (1.06% to 1.23%) during this time period, and

among chronic opioid users who did not use benzodiaz-
epines, the incidence increased from 2.00% (1.30% to 
2.70%) to 3.51% (3.05% to 3.98%). As shown in figure 2, 
the age adjusted incidence of opioid overdose was 
higher among concurrent benzodiazepine/opioid users. 
For example, among all opioid users who also used 
benzodiazepines, the age adjusted incidence of opioid 
overdose was 2.01% (1.64% to 2.39%) in 2001 and 3.99% 
(3.58% to 4.21%) in 2013.
Among all opioid users, the annual adjusted inci-
dence of an emergency room visit or inpatient admission 
for opioid overdose was 1.16% (95% confidence interval 
1.13% to 1.18%; fig 3) for those who did not use a benzo-
diazepine compared with 2.42% (2.32% to 2.51%) among 
concurrent benzodiazepine/opioid users, a significant 
difference (odds ratio 2.14, 95% confidence interval 2.05 
to 2.24; P<0.001). Intermittent opioid users who used a 
benzodiazepine concurrently also experience a higher 
incidence of emergency room visits or inpatient 
 
admissions for opioid overdose (1.45%, 1.36% to 1.51%) 
compared with intermittent opioid users who did not 
use a benzodiazepine concurrently (1.02%, 0.996% to 
1.04%), with an odds ratio of 1.42 (1.33 to 1.51; P<0.001). 
Chronic opioid users with concurrent benzodiazepine 
use also experienced a higher adjusted incidence of 
emergency room visits or inpatient admissions for opi-
oid overdose (5.36%, 5.12% to 5.61%) compared with 
those who did not use benzodiazepines (3.13%, 2.94% to 
3.31%), with an odds ratio of 1.81 (1.67 to 1.96; P<0.001).
Using the logistic regression model results, we esti-
mated the population attributable fraction for benzodi-
azepine co-prescribing to be 0.15 (95% confidence 
interval 0.14 to 0.16) among all opioid users, suggesting 
that eliminating concurrent benzodiazepine/opioid use 
could reduce the population risk for an opioid related 
emergency room visit or inpatient admission by 15%. 
Among intermittent opioid users, the population attrib-
utable fraction was 0.043 (0.034 to 0.051), whereas the 
population attributable fraction was 0.27 (0.23 to 0.30) 
for chronic users.
We conducted three sets of sensitivity analyses. First, 
we considered alternative measures of concurrent ben-
zodiazepine/opioid use (requiring 25% of the days of 
opioid to overlap with a benzodiazepine prescription) 
as well as alternative measures of opioid overdose. The 
results were qualitatively similar to our main results 
(appendix).
A second set of analyses examined whether imposing 
the requirement that our study population be continu-
ously enrolled from 2001 to 2013 could have resulted in 
bias. This set of analyses used a broader sample, con-
sisting of the patients in our original sample as well as 
patients who were continuously enrolled for at least 
two years but who might have subsequently left the 
sample. Among this larger sample, the adjusted relative 
risk was 1.66 for intermittent users (95% confidence 
interval 1.64 to 1.69; P<0.001) and 1.61 (1.58 to 1.63; 
P<0.001) for chronic users.
Finally, we performed a residual confounding analy-
sis to estimate the degree of confounding that would 
need to be present to explain our results. Assuming the 
presence of an unmeasured binary confounder with a 
prevalence of 75% among concurrent benzodiazepine/
opioid users or a prevalence of 0% among persons with 
no concurrent use, our analysis suggested that residual 
confounding would negate our results only if the odds 
ratio associated with the unmeasured confounder was 
at least 2.40. The odds ratio associated with this con-
founder would need to be at least 1.45 among intermit-
tent users and at least 1.89 among chronic users.
discussion
Principal findings
In a sample of privately insured patients, we found that the 
incidence of concurrent benzodiazepine/opioid use 
increased by roughly 80% from 2001 to 2013. Moreover, we 
found that opioid users who concurrently used benzodiaz-
epines were at an increased risk of opioid overdose and 
that eliminating concurrent benzodiazepine/opioid use 
could reduce the risk of opioid overdose by 15%. Opioid

prescribing, use, and overdose are receiving increased 
attention given the sharp increase in the number of opioid 
related adverse events over the past decade. Understand-
ing the underlying causes for these secular increases in 
opioid related events is an important step towards develop-
ing policies aimed at reducing their incidence.
Comparison with other studies
A previous study of patients receiving care from the Vet-
eran’s Administration found that 27% of opioid users 
also received benzodiazepines and that concurrent opi-
oid/benzodiazepine use was associated with an 
increased risk of death from opioid overdose.24  Another 
study found that nearly 80% of patients taking an opi-
oid also used a benzodiazepine and that those who 
used both drugs concurrently were at a tenfold 
increased risk of death from overdose,26  although in 
that study concurrent use was defined as having used 
an opioid and benzodiazepine at least once in a given 
year, without an attempt to identify the extent of over-
lap between the periods of opioid and benzodiazepine 
use. Using toxicology analysis, another study found 
that benzodiazepines were involved in 60% of deaths 
from opioid overdose in patients in Ontario, Canada.27
We also found that concurrent opioid/benzodiaze-
pine use was fairly common; differences in the magni-
tude of concurrent use between our studies and 
previous work is possibly because of differences in the 
definition of concurrent use as well as differences in the 
underlying patient population. Our study builds on 
these results by examining growth in concurrent use 
over time and estimating the effect of this growth on 
population health. Moreover, we examined concurrent 
use in a national sample that is broadly representative 
of the privately insured population in the US.
strengths and limitations of this study
Our results should be viewed in the light of the study’s 
limitations. First, we cannot exclude the possibility of 
confounding because of unobservable differences 
between opioid users who did and did not use benzodi-
azepines. While we dealt with this issue by adjusting for 
an extensive set of covariates and comorbidities, we can-
not exclude the possibility of further confounding. We 
did, however, perform a residual confounding analysis 
to judge the extent of confounding that would be needed 
to explain our results. Our analysis suggested that any 
unobserved confounder would need to exert effects 
larger than the estimated effect for concurrent benzodi-
azepine/opioid use and be unequally distributed across 
concurrent and non-concurrent users to a far larger 
extent than any of the potential measured confounders 
we considered, a scenario we consider to be unlikely.
Second, the construction of our sample—which 
required people to be continuously enrolled for the 
entire 13 year period—could also result in confounding 
as it excluded those who might have left the sample sec-
ondary to opioid related death or job loss. To deal with 
this issue, we performed sensitivity analyses in which 
we added to our original sample individuals who were 
continuously enrolled for at least two years but who 
might have subsequently left the sample secondary to 
death or job loss. The point estimates for this set of sen-
sitivity analyses were qualitatively similar to our base-
line estimates.
Third, we note that our analysis examined only cases 
of opioid overdose/poisoning when a patient received 
emergency room/hospital care and ultimately survived, 
which could mean that our analysis underestimated the 
true risk of opioid overdose.
Fourth, our analysis does not take into account changes 
in prescribing/patient behaviors that could evolve in 
response to reduced concurrent benzodiazepine/opioid 
prescribing. For example, if patients increase their dose of 
opioids in response to a reduction in concurrent benzodi-
azepine/opioid prescribing, this would mitigate some of 
the benefits we observed in the study.
Finally, we note that a prescription database would 
not capture heroin use or the use of prescription drugs 
bought illegally.
Conclusions and policy implications
These findings have several implications. From a clinical 
perspective, providers should exercise caution in pre-
scribing opioids for patients who are already using benzo-
diazepines (or vice versa), even in a non-chronic setting. 
Indeed, we note that the association between concurrent 
benzodiazepine/opioid use and the risk of opioid over-
dose was broadly similar for both intermittent and 
chronic opioid users. Therefore, opioids should be pre-
scribed cautiously—even if only for a short term course—
among patients who are also using benzodiazepines. 
From a policy perspective, in addition to the current focus 
on opioid prescribing, policymakers and healthcare sys-
tems should also focus on benzodiazepine prescribing 
behaviors, as these behaviors can play an important role 
in mitigating the risks of opioid prescriptions. Healthcare 
systems might also want to implement education pro-
grams that warn prescribers and patients about the risks 
of taking benzodiazepines and opioids concurrently, with 
the Veterans Health Administration’s system-wide opioid 
safety initiative being a potential model to emulate.
