care: considerations for clinical practice and
research
Selina M. Parry1, Minxuan Huang2,3 and Dale M. Needham2,3,4,5*
Abstract
The evaluation of physical functioning is valuable in the intensive care unit (ICU) to help inform patient recovery
after critical illness, to identify patients who may require rehabilitation interventions, and to monitor responsiveness
to such interventions. This viewpoint article discusses: (1) the concept of physical functioning with reference to the
World Health Organization International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health; (2) the importance of
measuring physical functioning in the ICU; and (3) methods for evaluating physical functioning in the ICU.
Recommendations for clinical practice and research are made, along with discussion of future directions.
Keywords: Critical illness, Physical function, Outcome measurement, Early mobility, Physical rehabilitation
Introduction
Improving the survivorship experience of patients is a
defining challenge for modern critical care medicine due
to improving mortality and increasing awareness of
patient morbidity [1–3]. Intensive care unit (ICU) sur-
vivors with multi-organ failure are particularly suscep-
tible to physical morbidity, with up to 30% muscle
loss within the first 10 days of ICU admission [4, 5].
The prevalence of ICU-acquired weakness is 25–40%
in patients ventilated for ≥ 48 h [6–8] and even higher
in patients with sepsis or a prolonged ICU length of
stay (LOS) [9–11]. Importantly, weakness and physical
functioning are predictive of subsequent LOS, post-
discharge survival, healthcare utilization, quality of life
(QOL), and return to home [12–14]. The evaluation
of physical functioning in the ICU is needed to help
inform patient recovery, identify patients who may re-
quire rehabilitation interventions, and monitor inter-
vention responsiveness.
Physical functioning in the context of the International
Classification of Functioning (ICF) framework
The World Health Organization (WHO) ICF framework
defines functioning as an umbrella term for the inter-
action between three distinct constructs: body function
and structure (physiological and anatomical structure of
the body systems), activities (execution of a specific task
within a standardized environment), and participation
(involvement in everyday life situations) [15]. The ICF
framework
explicitly
recognizes
that
functioning
is
affected by the interplay between an individual’s health
condition and contextual factors, which may include
personal (e.g., education) and environmental/social (e.g.,
home set-up, family support) factors [15].
Using this framework, physical functioning can be
evaluated across the three ICF constructs. First, function-
ing can be evaluated in terms of physiological impairment
at the level of individual organs or body systems (i.e., the
“body function” level of assessment of the ICF) [15], with
a specific focus on the neurological, cardiac, respiratory,
and musculoskeletal systems. Second, functioning can be
evaluated in terms of performance-based measurement
focused on limitations in specific activities, such as sitting,
standing, or walking [15]. Third, evaluation can include
assessment of participation restrictions, such as the ability
to perform activities of daily living (ADLs). These perspec-
tives evaluate distinct aspects of physical functioning and

 thus structure and function impairment (e.g., muscle
weakness) does not necessarily strongly correlate with
activity limitations (e.g., 6-min walk test) and participation
restrictions (e.g., ADLs) [13, 16, 17].
Importance of measuring physical functioning in the ICU
While post-ICU impairments in physical functioning
are common, our understanding of the specific sub-
groups of patients at highest risk for such impair-
ments, and with the greatest potential benefit from
rehabilitation
interventions,
is
evolving.
Measuring
physical functioning early and longitudinally in the
ICU is important to identify patients at risk of poor
physical outcomes, monitor intervention efficacy, and
inform recovery trajectories [12, 18, 19].
Pre-ICU factors, such as age, comorbidities, and pre-
ICU trajectories for muscle mass and physical functioning,
impact on the physical functioning of patients in the ICU
(Fig. 1). In addition, there are many factors related to crit-
ical illness and the ICU environment that can impact on
impairment in physiological body systems that are critical
to the physical functioning of patients in the ICU (Fig. 1).
Major considerations in choosing an instrument
In this next section we discuss four major considerations
when selecting an instrument (Fig. 2) and synthesise
current evidence (Table 1; Additional file 1: Table S1).
Purpose of assessment
The evaluation of physical functioning is complex and is
influenced by multiple interacting factors, including
strength,
range
of
motion,
proprioception,
balance,
cognition, and psychological issues (e.g., motivation)
[20]. There are also unique patient and environmental
factors (e.g., sedation, severity of illness, medical devices)
specific to the ICU. Determining the specific purpose for
assessing physical functioning is important when select-
ing an appropriate instrument. For example, if the
purpose is to evaluate intervention efficacy, users should
consider the specific effect of the intervention and
match it with an instrument that evaluates that effect.
Table 3 highlights that there are important differences
when each physical function instrument is mapped to
the relevant subdomains of the ICF framework. For
example, the Chelsea Critical Care Physical Assessment
Tool assesses both respiratory and mobility ICF subdo-
mains; the ICU Mobility Scale only evaluates mobility
subdomains; and the Physical Functional in ICU Test-
scored is a composite measure of mobility, strength, and
endurance. Hence, if the primary aim of an intervention
is to improve patient mobility via increased muscle
strength, it may be most appropriate to use a composite
instrument which evaluates mobility and strength (e.g.,
Physical Functional in ICU Test-scored or Chelsea
Critical Care Physical Assessment Tool) or separate in-
struments individually focused on strength and mobility
(e.g., dynamometry, plus ICU Mobility Scale or Func-
tional Status Score for the ICU). Whilst domains such as
climbing and jumping, which are evaluated within the
Acute Care Index of Function and the Critical Care
Functional Rehabilitation Outcome Measure, are less
relevant during an ICU admission, they are relevant later
Fig. 1 Impact of pre-ICU, critical illness and hospital/ICU factors on body systems related to physical functioning. Pre-ICU, critical illness, environ-
mental factors, and body-system impairments, have interdependent effects on physical functioning (e.g., ICU culture regarding sedation may lead
to neurological impairment resulting in immobility and musculoskeletal impairment)

 in the recovery process. Assessment of ‘climbing’ or stair
walking ability is often a critical consideration in evaluat-
ing a patient’s safety for discharge to home. Currently
there is not a single measure available that can be
utilized across the entire recovery trajectory. Therefore,
consideration of the elements evaluated under the sub-
domains of the ICF framework is important when select-
ing the relevant instrument based on the assessment
purpose.
Measurement properties
Relevant measurement properties to consider when
selecting an instrument include the ability to measure
what is intended (validity). This includes subjective in-
terpretation (face validity), whether the instrument’s
content adequately reflects the parameter of interest
(content validity), comparison with other tools measur-
ing a similar construct (construct validity), and predic-
tion of future outcomes (predictive validity) [21, 22]. In
addition, the ability to obtain accurate results within or
between
assessors
(intra-
and
inter-rater
reliability,
respectively), or when measures are repeated longitudin-
ally (test-retest reliability) is important. Instruments
should detect change over time (responsiveness) and
have a limited floor (proportion of patients scoring the
lowest score possible) and ceiling (proportion of patients
scoring the highest score possible) effect across the ex-
pected evaluation time points [22].
Notably, caution is needed if trying to extrapolate
instruments developed for one setting or patient popula-
tion to the ICU setting. This issue is particularly import-
ant given many unique issues within the ICU, including
sedation, delirium, fatigability, and weakness, that can
affect patient performance. For example, Acute Care
Index of Function, De Morton Mobility Index, and Short
Physical Performance Battery were initially developed
for use in non-ICU patient populations (e.g., geriatrics
and neurology), [23–25] with relatively little evaluation,
at present, within the ICU setting.
Table 1 and Additional file 1 (Table S1) synthesize data
on measurement properties for each instrument. An
adequate level of inter-rater reliability has been demon-
strated for all measurement instruments, except the
Short Physical Performance Battery, although this instru-
ment has established reliability in geriatrics. All instru-
ments have evidence of construct validity compared to
other concurrent measurements of physical function
and/or strength, except the Critical Care Functional Re-
habilitation Outcome Measure. This instrument only has
published data on face/content validity. Seven measure-
ment instruments have evidence of predictive validity.
The most commonly evaluated predictive outcome was
discharge to home, which was evaluated in six instru-
ments. The Short Physical Performance Battery was the
only instrument not predictive of discharge to home,
albeit the study may have been under-powered for this
assessment [26]. Accurately predicting individuals un-
able to be discharged to home is important to help
optimize the consistency, appropriateness, and timeli-
ness of discharge planning recommendations and re-
habilitation referral. There has been limited evaluation
of the predictive validity beyond hospital discharge with
only three instruments (ICU Mobility scale, Surgical
Optimal Mobility scale, and Physical Functional in ICU
Test-scored)
examining
post-hospital
mortality
with
conflicting findings (Table 1; Additional file 1: Table S1).
The ability to detect a clinically meaningful change over
time (responsiveness) was examined in five instruments
(Table 1; Additional file 1: Table S1): the Chelsea Critical
Care Physical Assessment Tool; the Functional Status
Score for the ICU; the ICU Mobility Scale; the Physical
Functional in ICU Test-scored; and the Short Physical
Performance Battery. All demonstrated significant change
over time within the ICU, and moderate to large effect
sizes (an indicator of moderate to good responsiveness)
were observed for the Functional Status Score for the ICU
and Physical Functional in ICU Test-scored.
The presence of floor and ceiling effects are important
considerations in assessing the recovery trajectories of
patients and the intervention efficacy [22]. High floor or
ceiling
effects
indicate
that
the
instrument
is
too
challenging or too easy, respectively, limiting its ability
to detect a change in the physical functioning of pa-
tients. The majority of instruments have low floor and
ceiling effects during an ICU stay (Table 1; Additional
file
1:
Table
S1).

 Performance Battery demonstrated large floor effects
which limits its potential utility in the ICU (Table 1;
Additional file 1: Table S1).
Based on published measurement properties alone, the
most robust ICU instruments are: Physical Functional in
ICU Test-scored; Chelsea Critical Care Physical Assess-
ment Tool; Functional Status Score for the ICU; and
ICU Mobility Scale (Table 1). Ongoing research is
needed to further understand the measurement proper-
ties of existing instruments to ensure appropriateness
and usability within the ICU setting.
Patient capacity
All instruments outlined herein (Tables 1 and 2) are
dependent on patient effort. Consequently, assessing
the feasibility of each instrument’s use within the ICU
is critical. Feasibility should consider the requirements
of the instrument, including issues related to a patient’s
alertness, ability to follow instructions, motivation,
weakness, and fatigability. A standardized method for
determining patient mental capacity (including vali-
dated and reliable determinations of pain, sedation, and
delirium status) is important to enable comparison of
results across patients [27] (Fig. 3). The Perme ICU
Mobility Score is unique as it includes evaluation of po-
tential barriers to mobility that may affect patient per-
formance (e.g., medical devices, pain, and respiratory
support). Impairments in the balance of patients may
also affect performance, with the De Morton Mobility
Index and Short Physical Performance Battery includ-
ing balance evaluation.
Clinical utility
The levels of expertise, training, and time required, as
well as any specialized equipment, are important in
assessing clinical utility. All instruments require minimal
additional equipment, apart from the Chelsea Critical
Care
Physical
Assessment
Tool
which
requires
a
handgrip dynamometer, and the Acute Care Index of
Function which requires a set of five steps (Table 2).
Dedicated ICU training packages are available for three
instruments: Chelsea Critical Care Physical Assessment
Tool; Functional Status Score for the ICU; and Physical
Function in ICU test-scored (Table 2). The fastest tests
are the simple one-item mobility scales that indicate the
patients highest level, while other more comprehensive
instruments
require
more
time
to
assess
multiple
specific activities and/or levels of assistance required
(Table 2).
Recommendations for clinical practice
We propose a staged approach for assessing physical
functioning in the ICU (Fig. 3). In terms of pre-ICU
status, we recommend obtaining physical functioning
data as part of the patient history to inform appropriate
patient goals for recovery and rehabilitation [2]. The

 ability to obtain a validated baseline measure of physical
functioning (or pre-ICU health status) is challenging due
to the severity of illness, sedation, and reduced ability of
patients to engage in volitional assessments. The Clinical
Frailty Scale can be used to obtain a baseline assessment
of frailty. Patients who are frail prior to ICU admission
have
worse
mortality
and
morbidity,
and
require
institutionalization at discharge; thus, frailty may be a
useful prognostic tool [28]. Similar to the process used
with the Functional Independence Measure instrument,
commonly used throughout the inpatient rehabilitation
setting, it is possible to conduct a baseline assessment
for the Functional Status Score for the ICU measure via
proxy assessment, as performed in prior research [29];
however, this baseline version of the Functional Status
Score for the ICU has not been specifically validated.
The ability to measure pre-ICU physical functioning is
an area for future research.
Screening for mental capacity should commence from
ICU admission and include assessments of pain, sedation,

In the development of this table the World Health Organization International Classification of Functioning linkages were used from http://apps.who.int/
classifications/icfbrowser/, accessed May 2016. The three most relevant domains identified were: B4—Functions of cardiovascular and respiratory system;
B7—Neuromuscular and Movement-Related Functions; and D4—Mobility. The final subdomain classification is identified in the first column including coding
(e.g., power of isolated muscles and muscle groups is coded b7300 in the ICF browser). Subdomains under D4—Mobility of the ICF framework not considered by
these functional measures include: squatting [d4101], kneeling [d4102], bending [d4106], shifting the body’s center of gravity [d4106], maintaining a squatting or
kneeling position [d4151 and d4152], transferring one-self while lying [d4201], lifting and carrying objects [d430], moving objects with lower extremities [d435],
hand and arm use [d445], and walking long distances, on different surfaces and around obstacles [d4501, d4502, and d4503, respectively]
#The tools ACIF and Perme assess additional subdomains not outlined in the table. For ACIF, these specific subdomains are: acquiring basic skills [d1550],
communicating with receiving—spoken messages [d310], and communicating when receiving—body gestures [d3150]. For Perme, these specific subdomains are:
communicating with receiving—spoken messages [d310], generalized pain [D2800], and consciousness functions [b110]. Additionally, Perme had subdomains which
could not be mapped to the ICF framework, including: need for mechanical ventilation or non-invasive ventilation; lines and attachments, and presence of drips

 and delirium status [27]. We also recommend regular
screening
for
muscle
weakness
using
the
Medical
Research Council sum-score. It is likely less important to
evaluate physical functioning in ICU patients who lack
muscle weakness; however, strength should not be a sole
guide for determining the need for physical functioning
assessment because strength and function are only weakly
correlated in ICU survivors [16]. At present, there is a lack
of robust, validated predictive models for physical func-
tioning impairments within the ICU. There is a predictive
model for physical functioning after hospital discharge,
but not whilst in hospital [12]. Therefore, identification of
patients who need evaluation of physical functioning in
the ICU is largely reliant on clinical judgment regarding
many potential risk factors (Fig. 1). Once the patient
can follow commands, we recommend, at a minimum,
one of the four recommended physical functioning
tools: Physical Functional in ICU Test-scored; Chelsea
Critical Care Physical Assessment Tool; Functional
Status Score for the ICU; and ICU Mobility scale.
Summary
information
about
these
instruments
(including how to access and use them) is available
through a free website: www.improveLTO.com.
When selecting specific instrument(s) for a particular
ICU setting, the following are important considerations:
available clinician resources and expertise; and rationale
for assessment (e.g., simple versus comprehensive evalu-
ation). In settings with limited access to rehabilitation
clinicians, a simple one-item scale (e.g., ICU mobility
scale) can be used, which can be feasibly completed by
the bedside ICU nurse. For patients with identified
mobility restrictions, consultation with physiotherapists
and occupational therapists may be warranted, with
more comprehensive instruments used as part of their
routine clinical evaluation (Fig. 3).
Areas for future investigation
There is an ongoing need to examine the measurement
properties and clinical utility of ICU physical functioning
instruments. In addition to primary measurement stud-
ies, valuable insights could be achieved through second-
ary analyses of existing studies that include relevant
instruments, enabling larger sample sizes across multi-
center trials [26, 30, 31]. Predictive validity is a critical
consideration and needs additional evaluation for all
instruments to assist with meaningful interpretation of
the scores and the effects of associated interventions.
The purpose of assessment should be considered when
selecting an instrument. As highlighted in Table 3, there
is variability in the subdomains evaluated across instru-
ments. Future research is required to determine the
most critical subdomains of physical functioning that al-
ways should be encompassed within evaluations in the
ICU and across the recovery trajectory. It is currently
unknown whether a single instrument, which encom-
passes all relevant subdomains and has robust measure-
ment properties, is feasible; it is likely more than one
instrument may be required.
There is often a delay in initiating evaluations of
physical
functioning
in
the
ICU
due
to
sedation,
delirium, and illness severity impacting the volitional
ability of patients. Hence, during this very early stage of
critical illness, non-volitional instruments may be appro-
priate
(e.g.,
screening
neuromuscular
electrophysio-
logical or ultrasound tests [2]). Generally, these non-
volitional assessments are not part of routine clinical
practice. Further examination of their clinical utility and
measurement properties is needed. Future work should
also explore how psychological and cognitive capacity
impact patient performance, engagement, and the timing
and frequency of evaluation of physical functioning.
Conclusions
Impairment in physical functioning among ICU survivors
results in significant morbidity and burden to patients,
caregivers, and society. With a growing population of ICU
survivors, greater utilization and standardization of phys-
ical functioning instruments is needed. This article has
provided a framework and recommendations for practice.
Measuring physical functioning early and longitudinally in
the ICU is important to determine patients at risk of poor
physical outcomes, monitor intervention efficacy, and
inform recovery trajectories. These insights are important
to improving the outcomes of critically ill patients.
