Brown fat is a specialized fat depot that can increase energy expenditure and produce heat. After the recent discovery of the pres-
ence of active brown fat in human adults and novel transcription factors controlling brown adipocyte differentiation, the field of 
the study of brown fat has gained great interest and is rapidly growing. Brown fat expansion and/or activation results in increased 
energy expenditure and a negative energy balance in mice and limits weight gain. Brown fat is also able to utilize blood glucose 
and lipid and results in improved glucose metabolism and blood lipid independent of weight loss. Prolonged cold exposure and 
beta adrenergic agonists can induce browning of white adipose tissue. The inducible brown adipocyte, beige adipocyte evolving by 
thermogenic activation of white adipose tissue have different origin and molecular signature from classical brown adipocytes but 
share the characteristics of high mitochondria content, UCP1 expression and thermogenic capacity when activated. Increasing 
browning may also be an efficient way to increase whole brown fat activity. Recent human studies have shown possibilities that 
findings in mice can be reproduced in human, making brown fat a good candidate organ to treat obesity and its related disorders.

INTRODUCTION
Obesity has increased at an alarming rate worldwide. Since 
obesity is associated with many diseases, such as type 2 diabe-
tes, insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, hypertension, cardiovas-
cular disease, sleep apnea, and some types of cancer, the rapid 
increase in obesity is a major health burden [1]. Although there 
is an epidemic of obesity worldwide the effort to decrease this 
epidemic has not been effective and there is a growing need of 
novel therapeutics to prevent and treat obesity [2]. Obesity is 
thought to be caused by an imbalance between energy intake 
and energy consumption. Pharmacologic agents currently ap-
proved have the effect of mainly decreasing energy intake and 
there are currently no approved drug that can increase energy 
consumption. 
 Fat tissue had been considered a simple storage organ until 
the late 1980s. Many lines of evidence subsequently estab-
lished adipose tissue as an endocrine organ secreting many 
hormones and cytokines that can influence systemic metabo-
lism [3]. Moreover, recent work has established distinct adi-
pose depots that play specific roles. In contrast to white fat, 
which mainly stores energy and is increased in obesity, brown 
fat generates heat (thermogenesis), thus increasing consump-
tion of energy; as such, brown fat and the induction of brown 
fat-like properties in white fat, has been considered as a target 
for fighting obesity. Brown fat, also known as brown adipose 
tissue (BAT) by dissipating energy as heat, has an essential role 
of maintaining body temperature in rodents and human neo-
nates [4]. In human adults, the existence of BAT was debated, 
and if present, thought to be a remnant, physiologically non-

significant organ until recently. Several groups have shown us-
ing fluorodeoxy glucose (FDG)-positron emission tomography 
(PET) in combination with computed tomography (CT), the 
presence of brown fat and the association with age, leanness, 
and environmental temperature with brown fat activity [5-7]. 
These studies have made brown fat to be a plausible target or-
gan for the management of obesity and its related diseases in 
human. By increasing the amount and/or activity of brown fat, 
energy consumption can be increased, and this will lead to a 
negative energy balance. The field of basic science has also 
shown much progress in the understanding of brown fat devel-
opment and physiology [4,8]. The finding of an inducible ther-
mogenic adipocyte, the beige (inducible, brite) adipocyte has 
also been studied extensively.
 In this review, we will review the development and function 
of brown and beige adipocytes, the role and significance of 
brown fat and browning in the treatment of obesity and diabe-
tes, and the relevance in humans. 
BROWN ADIPOCYTES AND BEIGE 
ADIPOCYTES
Brown adipocytes are the major constituents of BAT, occupy-
ing the largest area. Traditionally adipocytes have been divid-
ed into white adipocytes and brown adipocytes. White adipo-
cytes and brown adipocytes both have fat droplets but these 
differ in morphology and function. White adipocytes have a 
unilocular fat droplet, relatively few mitochondria, and mainly 
store fat. In contrast, brown adipocytes have multilocular fat 
droplets, a high content of mitochondria, and a high level of 
expression of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) in the inner mem-
brane of mitochondria. UCP1 is a critical player in allowing 
electrons to be released rather than stored, resulting in heat re-
lease. The most important and well-studied factor influencing 
brown adipocytes is norepinephrine (NE). NE is able to affect 
activation, cell proliferation and differentiation of brown adi-
pocytes. NE mainly functions through the β-adrenergic recep-
tor, especially the β3-adrenoreceptor. After receptor binding, 
via adenylyl cyclase activation, cyclic adenosine monophos-
phate (cAMP) level is increased and protein kinase A (PKA) is 
activated leading to triglyceride breakdown and release of free 
fatty acids (FFAs) which are acute substrates for thermogene-
sis and regulators of the activity of UCP1. PKA can phosphor-
ylate cAMP-response-element-binding (CREB) and p38 mito-
gen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) which drives a ther-
mogenic transcriptional response including the induction of 
UCP1 gene expression [4,9,10]. Brown adipocytes can dissi-
pate chemical energy stored as triglycerides by channeling fat-
ty acids into β oxidation when activated. UCP1 is able to un-
couple electron transport from adenosine triphosphate (ATP) 
production and produces heat in brown adipocytes [8,11]. 
 Beige adipocytes (also called ‘brite,’ ‘brown-like,’ ‘inducible 
brown’) are an inducible form of thermogenic adipocytes and 
have a low UCP1 content in basal conditions but when induced 
have a high UCP1 expression level and increased energy con-
sumption [4,12]. The origin and characteristics of classical 
brown adipocytes and beige adipocytes are different (Table 1). 
Classical brown adipocytes originate from precursor cells in the 
embryonic mesoderm that express Myf5 and Pax7 [13]. Beige 
adipocytes are thought to come from a distinct cell lineage 
mainly of a Myf5 negative lineage. The origin of beige adipo-
cytes residing in white fat tissue has been a focus of great debate 
[4]. Some studies have shown that the origin was trans-differen-
tiation from mature white adipocytes [14,15] whereas a recent 
study using a pulse-chase fate-mapping technique, has shown

that most of the beige adipocytes arise by de novo differentiation 
from a precursor population [16]. Beige and white adipocytes 
arising from the white adipose tissue (WAT) are thought to arise 
from a different type of precursor cells. Wu et al. [17] has identi-
fied two types of preadipocytes (white and beige) using global 
gene profiling and differentiation analysis. Beige preadipocytes 
expressed Cd137 and transmembrane protein 26 (Tmem26) on 
the cell surface and only the adipocytes differentiated from the 
beige preadipocytes were able to induce a thermogenic gene 
program with β-adrenergic agonist treatment [17]. Beige adi-
pocytes are most abundant in the subcutaneous depots of ro-
dents [14]. In epididymal WAT of male mice which is a visceral 
fat depot, beige adipocytes develop from a bipotent precursor 
that can also differentiate into white adipocytes. These bipotent 
precursors express platelet-derived growth factor receptor α 
and represent a subpopulation of stromal cells expressing the 
common stem cell markers CD34 and Sca-1 [18]. 
 Master regulators of adipogenesis, peroxisome proliferator-
activated receptor γ (PPARγ) and CCAAT/enhancer-binding 
proteins (C/EBPs), are involved in the differentiation of both 
white and brown adipocytes [8]. A large zinc finger-contain-
ing transcriptional factor, PR domain containing 16 (PRDM 
16) plays a major role in the cell fate decision process promot-
ing the development of brown adipocytes from Myf5 express-
ing precursors [13]. PRDM16 was also able to induce brown 
fat cells in WAT [19]. PRDM16 stimulates brown adipogenesis 
by binding to PPARγ coactivator 1α (PGC-1α), PGC-1β, C/
EBP-β and PPARγ and activating its transcriptional function 
[13,19,20]. 
 BAT, due to its ability to uncouple electron gradients, gener-
ate ATP and promote energy dissipation, can be a target for 
obesity management. In rodents, BAT is found in the inter-
scapular, perirenal, and periaortic regions. In human infants, 
similar to rodents, BAT depots mainly reside in the interscap-
ular and perirenal area and this depot gradually disappears 
with increasing age [21,22]. Human adults mainly have BAT 
in the cervical, supraclavicular, axillary and paravertebral ar-
eas as demonstrated in studies using 18F-FDG-PET/CT [5-7]. 
BAT is composed of brown adipocytes with a high content of 
the BAT specific mitochondrial protein, UCP1 [23]. UCP1 has 
no activity in basal states but can be activated by long chain 
fatty acids generated within the mitochondrial inner mem-
brane [24]. BAT is highly vascularized and densely innervated 
by the sympathetic nervous system. BAT is activated by cold 
exposure and is mainly controlled by the sympathetic nervous 
system. Sympathetic activation of BAT results in increased 
thermogenic gene expression and recruitment of enzymes 
needed for uptake, mobilization and oxidation of lipids [23]. 
The thyroid hormone system also plays a synergistic role and 
is essential for BAT activation [25]. BAT can also be activated 
by increasing caloric intake in rodents and this process is 
termed diet-induced thermogenesis [11,26]. This will be of 
great relevance to the BAT based obesity treatment but this 
has not yet been confirmed in humans. 
BROWNING OF ADIPOSE TISSUE
Clusters of thermogenic beige adipocytes can be seen in tradi-
tional WAT depots after chronic cold exposure or through the 
genetic manipulation of specific pathways [27]. Whether 
white adipocytes can be induced to transdifferentiate into a 
more brown adipocyte like state remains unresolved. Regard-
less, both processes are referred to in general as ‘browning’ of 
WAT [8]. Chronic treatment with β3-adrenergic receptor acti-
vators and thiazolidinediones can also induce the browning 
process [28,29]. Increasing the amount of beige fat may be a 
valid method to increase the amount of BAT and increase en-
ergy consumption. Accordingly, many rodent models have 
shown that increased browning of the WAT was able to resist 
diet induced obesity and improve metabolism [4,30-33]. Re-
cent studies showing that the adult BAT shows characteristics 
of beige adipocytes reinforces the browning of adipose tissue 
as an interesting therapeutic possibility [17]. The browning 
process is regulated by a complex hormonal interplay and 
many environmental factors such as chronic cold exposure, 
exercise and environmental enrichment (Table 1) [8,34]. 
Chronic cold exposure
Cold is sensed by thermoreceptors and leads to a sympathetic 
outflow to BAT through a neural circuitry [35]. Classically, NE 
released from the sympathetic nerve terminal activates the 
BAT thermogenic program via PKA and p38 MAPK signaling 
and leads to lipolysis and production of FFA for UCP1 activa-
tion [34]. Recent studies have elucidated an efferent beige fat 
thermogenic circuit-consisting of eosinophils, type 2 cyto-
kines interleukin (IL)-4/13, and alternatively activated macro-
phages-which regulate the development of cold-induced beige 
fat. Cold exposure induces eosinophil IL-4/13 production and 
this leads to M2 macrophage activation which induces tyro-
sine hydroxylase expression and catecholamine production

leading to browning of subcutaneous WAT [36,37]. Meteorin-
like (Metrnl) is a PGC-1α4-regulated hormone that is induced 
upon exercise and cold exposure promoting browning by in-
ducing IL-4/13 and M2 macrophage activation, which is re-
quired for long-term adaptations to cold temperatures [37]. 
Exercise
Exercise has been reported to increase browning of WAT and in-
crease energy expenditure. There is a possibility that this mecha-
nism may be an additional pathway leading to the chronic bene-
fits of exercise training on glucose and lipid metabolism [38]. 
PGC-1α is induced in the muscle by exercise and stimulates 
many beneficial effects of exercise in muscle, including mito-
chondrial biogenesis and muscle fibre-type switching [39]. PGC-
1α is able to increase expression of FNDC5 (fibronectin do-
main-containing 5), a membrane protein that is cleaved and se-
creted as irisin. Although controversial, irisin has been reported 
to be induced by exercise in mice and humans and capable of in-
ducing browning of WAT, resulting in improvements in obesity 
and glucose homeostasis [38]. Metrnl is a myokine induced by 
resistance exercise and PGC-1α4. Metrnl is able to promote acti-
vation of M2 macrophages and catecholamine production from 
these cells to induce WAT browning [37]. IL-6 is a major myo-
kine induced by exercise and has been reported to play a role in 
exercise induced WAT browning [40].
Environmental enrichment
Living in an enriched environment with complex physical and 
social stimulation was able to induce browning of WAT in mice. 
This is mediated by induction of hypothalamic brain-derived 
neurotropic factor (BDNF) expression, which leads to selective 
sympathetic nervous system activation of white fat to induce 
browning and increase energy dissipation. Environmental en-
richment was able to resist diet-induced obesity through the 
browning effect. Hypothalamic overexpression of BDNF was 
able to reproduce the enrichment-associated activation of 
browning of WAT and the associated lean phenotype [41]. 
Endocrine factors and metabolites
There are many novel factors and signaling pathways that can 
induce brown and/or beige. Among these factors fibroblast 
growth factors 21 (FGF21) [42-45], cardiac natriuretic pep-
tides (NPs) [46], retinaldehyde (Rald) [31], bone morphonge-
netic proteins (BMPs) [47,48] are secreted molecules that can 
activate BAT and/or induce browning in WAT. FGF21 is an 
endocrine factor produced in liver, BAT, and skeletal muscle 
[49]. Cold exposure induces FGF21 gene transcription and 
FGF21 release in brown adipocytes via cAMP-mediated PKA 
and p38 MAPK activation [43]. Cold induced increase in plas-
ma FGF21 levels was also observed in humans [50]. FGF21 
plays a physiological role in browning of WAT. Adipose-de-
rived FGF21 acts in an autocrine and paracrine manner to in-
crease UCP1 and other thermogenic genes in fat tissues. These 
processes are in part regulated by enhancing adipose tissue 
PGC-1α protein levels without affecting mRNA expression. 
Mice deficient of FGF21 showed an impaired ability to adapt to 
chronic cold exposure and decreased browning of WAT [45].
 The cardiac NPs, atrial NP (ANP) and its ventricular com-
panion, brain-type NP (BNP) are key hormones in fluid and 
hemodynamic homeostasis. NPs are expressed in adipose tissue 
and ANP was shown to increase lipolysis in human adipocytes 
[51]. Bordicchia et al. [46] showed that NPs promote browning 
of white adipocytes to increase energy expenditure and increase 
thermogenic gene expression in BAT. In human adipocytes, 
ANP and BNP activated PGC-1α and UCP1 expression, in-
duced mitochondriogenesis and increased uncoupled and total 
respiration. ANP and β-adrenergic receptor agonists additively 
enhanced expression of brown fat and mitochondrial markers 
in a p38 MAPK-dependent manner. Mice exposed to cold tem-
peratures had increased levels of circulating NPs and a higher 
expression of NP signaling receptor in BAT and WAT. Infusion 
of BNP into mice robustly increased Ucp1 and Pgc-1α expres-
sion in WAT and BAT with corresponding elevation of respira-
tion and energy expenditure. NP bind to NP receptor A, whose 
intracellular domain possesses guanylyl cyclase activity to gen-
erate cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP). Activation of 
guanylyl cyclase and generation of cGMP leads to activation of 
cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG) [46]. PKG works in 
parallel with the β-adrenergic-PKA pathway to trigger lipolysis 
and stimulate thermogenesis [4]. 
 BMPs are members of the transforming growth factor β su-
perfamily of extracellular signaling proteins that influence the 
differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells. Several BMP mem-
bers have been shown to play a role in the regulation of adipo-
cyte differentiation and energy expenditure [52]. BMP7 pro-
motes differentiation of brown preadipocytes through induc-
tion of PRDM16 and PGC-1α, which are early regulators of 
brown fat fate. BMP7 can also trigger commitment of mesen-
chymal progenitor cells to a brown adipocyte lineage. BMP7 
knockout embryos show a marked decrease in brown fat and

almost complete absence of UCP1. Adenoviral expression of 
BMP7 in mice results in a significant increase in BAT mass 
and leads to an increase in energy expenditure and a reduction 
in weight gain [53]. BMP7 is also able to induce differentiation 
of Sca-1 positive progenitor cells from muscle and subcutane-
ous WAT into brown-like adipocytes [47]. BMP4 is expressed 
at an elevated level in WAT of lean human subjects. Induced 
expression of BMP4 in WAT induces browning of WAT and 
increases whole body metabolic rate and insulin sensitivity. 
PGC-1α mediates the BMP4 induced browning of WAT [48]. 
BMP8B appears to have both central and peripheral actions. 
BMP8B is induced by nutritional and thermogenic factors in 
mature BAT, increasing the response to noradrenaline through 
enhanced p38MAPK/CREB signaling and increased lipase ac-
tivity. Central BMP8B treatment increases sympathetic activa-
tion of BAT, dependent on the level of AMP-activated protein 
kinase (AMPK) in the ventromedial nucleus of the hypothala-
mus. BMP8B null mice show decreased energy expenditure 
and increased body weight gain. BMP8B is a thermogenic 
protein that can act centrally with hypothalamic AMPK to 
regulate energy expenditure [54].
 Retinaldehyde dehydrogenase 1 (Aldh1a1) is the rate-limit-
ing enzyme that converts Rald to retinoic acid. Aldh1a1 is ex-
pressed predominately in WAT, with the highest levels found 
in visceral WAT in mice and humans. Deficiency of the Ald-
h1a1 in mice induced browning of WAT that drove uncoupled 
respiration and adaptive thermogenesis, protecting against di-
et-induced obesity and diabetes [31]. In addition to this phe-
notype in the knockout mouse, antisense oligonucleotide-me-
diated Aldh1a1 knockdown in visceral WAT was able to repli-
cate this response, promoting browning of WAT with increased 
thermogenesis, decreased weight gain and improved glucose 
homeostasis in high fat diet (HFD) fed mice. These effects 
seem to be related to increased Rald levels, since Rald was able 
to induce UCP1 mRNA and protein levels in white adipocytes 
by selectively activating the retinoic acid receptor, recruiting 
PGC-1α and inducing UCP1 promoter activity [31]. 
TARGETING BROWN FAT FOR THE 
TREATMENT OF OBESITY AND RELATED 
DISORDERS 
Increasing BAT amount and/or increasing BAT activity can 
lead to increased energy expenditure which will be favorable 
in preventing and managing obesity. Increasing BAT amount 
and/or activity will also have a direct beneficial effect on glu-
cose and lipid metabolism independent from the effect on 
body weight (Fig. 1) [55]. Cold exposure can accelerate plasma 
clearance of triglycerides as a result of increased uptake into 
BAT in mice. This process is dependent on local lipoprotein li-
pase activity and transmembrane receptor CD36. In patho-
physiological settings of dyslipidemia and insulin resistance, 
Fig. 1. Brown adipose tissue (BAT) targeted treatment of obesity and related metabolic disorders. Increasing BAT amount and/
or BAT activity leads to increased activation of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) and thermogenesis leading to energy expenditure 
which will have anti-obesity effects. On the other hand, BAT can also increase the uptake of blood glucose and lipid. Glucose and 
fatty acids are oxidized or stored as glycogen or triglyceride. This results in decrease in blood glucose and lipid and increase in 
insulin sensitivity, leading to anti-diabetic and anti-dyslipidemic effects.

cold exposure corrected hyperlipidemia and improved the 
deleterious effects of insulin resistance [55]. BAT can clear a 
substantial portion of total glucose and triglycerides from the 
circulation when activated. Therefore targeting BAT will have 
beneficial effects on metabolic disorders related to obesity. 
 Evidence of the beneficial effects of increasing brown fat 
amount can be seen from genetic models of increased BAT [4] 
and BAT transplantation [56]. BAT transplantation into the 
visceral cavity in mice resulted in improved glucose tolerance, 
increased insulin sensitivity, lower body weight, and decreased 
fat mass. BAT transplantation also resulted in complete reversal 
of HFD-induced insulin resistance [56]. The beneficial effect of 
BAT transplantation can also be attributed to secreted factors 
from the BAT. Another method to increase BAT amount can 
be increased browning of WAT. 
 PGC-1α plays a central role in thermogenic activation of adi-
pocytes. PGC-1α was discovered as a cold-induced interacting 
partner of PPARγ in brown fat [57]. PGC-1α is a master regula-
tor of mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative metabolism and 
in adipocytes, can also induce the expression of UCP1 and other 
thermogenic components [4]. PGC-1α is essential for cold in-
duced and β-adrenergic agonist induced thermogenic activation 
of brown adipocytes [58]. PGC-1α expression and activity are 
regulated directly by the β-adrenergic pathway, linking physio-
logic activator of brown fat thermogenesis and the transcrip-
tional machinery in brown adipocytes [4,59]. cAMP and PKA 
dependent activation of p38 MAPK in brown adipocytes phos-
phorylates activating transcription factor 2 (ATF-2) and PGC-
1α. Activation of ATF-2 by p38 MAPK additionally serves as the 
cAMP sensor that increases expression of the PGC-1α gene it-
self in BAT [59]. 
BROWN FAT AND BROWNING IN HUMANS 
The beneficial effects of BAT have been shown mainly in ani-
mal models, leaving unresolved whether thermogenesis might 
be harnessed in humans. However, the field of the study of hu-
man brown fat is emerging rapidly and during recent years, 
many researchers using sophisticated methods are tackling the 
issue of the characteristics of human brown fat and its thera-
peutic possibilities [34,60]. Many studies have tried to charac-
terize the human BAT using markers of classical brown adipo-
cytes and beige adipocytes of mice. The interscapular BAT that 
is seen in human infants show characteristics of classic brown 
adipocytes [22]. The supraclavicular BAT in adult humans ex-
press high levels of beige-adipocyte enriched genes, including 
T-box transcription factor 1 (Tbx1), Tmem26, Cd137 [17]. On 
the contrary recent studies have shown that adult BAT express 
classical brown adipocyte-selective markers, including upregu-
lation of miR260, miR-133b, LIM homeobox protein 8 (Lhx8) 
and zinc finger protein 1 (Zic1) and down regulation of ho-
meobox C8 (Hoxc8) and homeobox C9 (Hoxc9) [61]. This 
discrepancy is probably due to the heterogeneity of human 
BAT and the difference in gene signature according to depth, 
with deeper depots showing more characteristics of classical 
brown [62]. Shinoda et al. [63] isolated clonally derived adipo-
cytes from stromal vascular fractions of adult human BAT and 
globally analyzed their molecular signature and found it re-
sembled those of murine beige adipocytes. Sidossis et al. [64] 
showed that human subcutaneous WAT undergoes browning 
and is associated with increased whole-body metabolic rate us-
ing burn trauma as a model of prolonged adrenergic stress. 
 There have been many clinical studies in human adults that 
suggest the beneficial effect of activating BAT [34]. Ouellet et 
al. [65] quantified BAT oxidative metabolism and glucose and 
nonesterified fatty acid (NEFA) turnover in healthy men un-
der controlled cold exposure conditions. Upon cold exposure, 
there was increased NEFA and glucose uptake and activation 
of oxidative metabolism in BAT associated with a 1.8-fold in-
crease in whole-body energy expenditure [65]. Yoneshiro et al. 
[66] showed that daily 2 hours cold exposure at 17°C for 6 
weeks resulted in increases in BAT activity and cold induced 
increments of energy expenditure and a concomitant decrease 
in body fat mass. Chondronikola et al. [67] reported that pro-
longed cold exposure for 5 to 8 hours was able to increase rest-
ing energy expenditure (REE) by 15% in BAT positive men, 
and plasma glucose (30%) and FFA (70%) contributed to the 
observed increase in REE. Glucose disposal was increased in 
BAT and whole-body glucose disposal was significantly in-
creased [67]. In type 2 diabetes subjects, 10 days of cold accli-
mation increased peripheral insulin sensitivity by 43%. Basal 
skeletal muscle glucose transporter type 4 (GLUT4) transloca-
tion was markedly increased and glucose uptake in skeletal 
muscle was increased after cold acclimation [68]. In summary, 
BAT activation through cold exposure was able to increase en-
ergy expenditure and have beneficial effects on glucose me-
tabolism supporting its role in treating obesity and related 
metabolic disorders in humans.

CONCLUSIONS
The current epidemic of obesity and its related complications 
like diabetes and heart disease is alarming and underscores the 
need for novel therapeutics. Targeting BAT and browning of 
WAT has arisen as a potentially important, efficient strategy to 
treat obesity and its related metabolic disorders. Increasing the 
amount and/or activity of theromogenesis will lead to a nega-
tive energy balance by increasing energy expenditure; and de-
crease blood glucose and triglyceride substantially, improving 
diabetes and dyslipidemia. Many recent human studies have 
shown that the effects of manipulating brown fat pathways 
seen in mice are also present in humans. However, more stud-
ies are needed to understand the differential physiology and 
role of brown and beige adipocyte. Understanding their spe-
cific mechanism and physiology will enable the development 
of more safe and efficient therapeutic agents for the treatment 
of obesity and related metabolic disorders.
