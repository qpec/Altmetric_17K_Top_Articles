Abstract
Immature mucosal defenses contribute to increased susceptibility of newborn infants to pathogens. 
Sparse knowledge of age-dependent changes in mucosal immunity has hampered improvements in 
neonatal morbidity due to infections. Here, we report that exposure of neonatal mice to commensal 
bacteria immediately after birth is required for a robust host defense against bacterial pneumonia, 
the leading cause of death in newborn infants. This crucial window was characterized by an abrupt 
influx of interleukin (IL)-22 producing group 3 innate lymphoid cells (IL22+ILC3) into the lungs 
of newborn mice. This influx was dependent on sensing of commensal bacteria by intestinal 
mucosal dendritic cells. Disruption of postnatal commensal colonization or selective depletion of 
dendritic cells interrupted the migratory program of lung IL-22+ILC3 and made the newborn mice 
more susceptible to pneumonia, which was reversed by transfer of commensal bacteria after birth. 
Thus, the resistance of newborn mice to pneumonia relied on commensal bacteria-directed ILC3-
influx into the lungs, which mediated IL-22-dependent host resistance to pneumonia during this 
developmental window. These data establish that postnatal colonization by intestinal commensal 
bacteria is pivotal in the development of lung defenses in mice.

 Introduction
Development of the immune system requires a sequential series of timed and coordinated 
events that begin early in fetal life and continue through the early postnatal period (1). 
Disruption of immune development during the early neonatal period results in abnormal 
postnatal immune responses that are more dramatic and persistent than those after disruption 
during adult life, highlighting the importance of the neonatal period as a critical 
developmental window (2). While several host genetic and environmental factors modulate 
the development of the immune system during fetal and early postnatal life (3), few are as 
important as the continued interaction with commensal bacteria, which is not only the most 
intimate environmental exposure (4, 5), but also represents a challenge to the developing 
immune system (6, 7).
Commensal colonization, which begins at birth, progresses through a choreographed 
succession of bacterial species and evolves rapidly during the first month of life (8). These 
evolving microbial signals are hypothesized to play a critical role in the functional 
programming of immune cells. Modern childbirth practices like caesarean deliveries (9) and 
increased use of antibiotics in early life (10) not only alter the pattern of intestinal 
commensal colonization in the newborn, but are also associated with increased risk of sepsis 
and pneumonia (10–14), suggesting that intestinal commensal bacteria can promote the 
resistance of newborn infants to pneumonia. The interaction between host and the intestinal 
commensal bacteria extends beyond the local enteric environment and influences immune 
homeostasis at peripheral sites, exemplified by intestinal complications during respiratory 
disease and vice versa (15, 16). Nevertheless, the mechanistic basis of cross talk between the 
intestinal commensal bacteria and innate lung defense, the so-called gut-lung axis, remains 
poorly defined (17) and the developmental pathways underlying the association between 
commensal colonization in the early postnatal period and development of lung immunity in 
newborns remain unexplored.
Here, we show that interactions between host and the intestinal commensal bacteria shape 
the repertoires of immune cells in the newborn mouse lung and importantly directs the

 postnatal ontogeny of IL-22 producing type 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3), a group of 
sentinel cells that maintain homeostasis at mucosal barrier sites. This postnatal influx of 
IL-22+ILC3 promotes the resistance of neonatal mice to pneumonia. This crosstalk is 
mediated by mucosal dendritic cells (DC), which capture signals from intestinal commensal 
bacteria. Disruption of commensal bacteria interrupted the migratory program of ILC3, 
impairing their ability to traffic to the lungs and rendering the newborn mice more 
susceptible to pneumonia, which was reversed by exogenous IL-22 or through adoptive 
transfer of ILC3. Reconstitution of intestinal commensal bacteria restored the expression of 
CCR4 on the ILC3, restored the ability of ILC3 to migrate into the lungs and promoted 
IL-22 dependent resistance to pneumonia in newborn mice.
Results
Postnatal colonization by commensal bacteria promotes resistance to pneumonia in 
newborn mice
Prior epidemiological studies show that human infants whose mothers received frequent 
antibiotics before birth, or who were delivered by Caesarean section, not only had altered 
intestinal commensal bacteria (18, 19), but also had increased risk of developing pneumonia 
(20, 21). This led us to hypothesize that early life exposure to commensal bacteria promotes 
resistance to pneumonia in newborns. To test this hypothesis, we exposed pregnant mouse 
dams to a combination of ampicillin, gentamicin, and vancomycin, three commonly used 
antibiotics in pregnant women and human newborns (22)(Fig. 1A), beginning 5 days before 
delivery. Antibiotics were discontinued immediately after birth and newborn mice were 
challenged intratracheally with Streptococcus pneumoniae (S. pneumoniae) serotype 19 A, a 
leading cause of pneumonia in human newborns (23).
This early life antibiotic exposure reduced not only the total number of commensal bacteria 
(Fig. 1B) but also disrupted the succession of bacterial species in the intestine of newborn 
mice (Fig. S1A,B, Table S1A). Six hours post infection, we observed an increased bacterial 
load in the lungs and the bronchial lavage (BAL) fluid (Fig. S1C) and increased 
susceptibility in newborn mice whose dams were exposed to antibiotics (ABX-exposed) as 
compared to age-matched mice whose dams were not exposed to antibiotics (ABX-free) 
(Fig. 1C). Germ-free (GF) mice, which lack commensal bacteria, similarly were more 
susceptible to challenge with S. pneumoniae as compared to the age-matched conventionally 
raised (CNV) mice (Fig. 1D). We paralleled these observations using Escherichia coli K1 or 
Candida albicans, other common causes of pneumonia in newborns (Fig. S1D,E) (24). Since 
disruption of commensal bacteria in infancy is associated with increased susceptibility to 
inflammatory disorders like allergen-induced airway hyperreactivity (25) and colitis (26) in 
later life, we ascertained whether disruption of postnatal commensal colonization led to 
durable changes in host resistance to infection. We found that increased susceptibility to 
pneumonia after early life ABX-exposure persisted beyond the neonatal period, until at least 
four weeks of age (Fig. 1E). This persistence in susceptibility contrasted with the transient 
susceptibility to infection that occurs in ABX-exposed adult mice (27, 28), highlighting the 
critical nature of commensal exposure in early life.

 We reversed the commensal disruption in ABX-exposed newborns by transferring intestinal 
contents from a newborn mouse in the early postnatal period as done previously (Fig. 1A) 
(29). Reconstitution of intestinal commensal bacteria restored resistance to pneumonia in 
ABX-exposed and GF newborn mice (Fig. 1C,D). This protection against S. penumoniae 
persisted beyond the neonatal period. ABX-exposed mice that received intestinal contents in 
the early postnatal period likewise showed increased resistance to infection at least for as 
long as four weeks after birth compared to their littermates that did not receive intestinal 
bacterial reconstitution (Fig. 1E,F).
Whether lung-resident commensal bacteria educate the mucosal immune system, like the 
intestinal commensal bacteria, remains a source of controversy (30, 31) and the effect of 
early life antibiotics on lung commensal colonization in human newborns remains 
unexplored. We found no difference in the composition of lung commensal bacteria in ABX-
free and ABX-exposed mice (Fig. S1F,G, Table S1B), perhaps related to our experimental 
strategy of limiting ABX-exposure to the pregnant dams and not the newborn mice. Lack of 
differences in lung-resident commensal bacteria in the ABX-exposed newborn mice as 
compared to ABX-free newborns suggest that intestinal commensal bacteria rather than lung 
commensals mediate the resistance to pneumonia, although this possibility cannot be 
completely excluded.
Postnatal colonization by commensal bacteria promotes interleukin (IL)-22 dependent 
mucosal defenses in newborn mice
We hypothesized that disruption of commensal colonization mediated changes in the 
expression of genes related to various aspects of innate lung defense. We carried out RNA 
sequencing analysis of lung mucosal RNA isolated from newborn mice on day 0-4. 
Unsupervised analysis revealed consistent transcriptional changes in ABX-exposed 
newborns as compared to ABX-free murine newborns (Fig. S1H, Table S2). Differentially 
expressed genes included interleukin (IL)-22, a cytokine critical in lung epithelial repair 
(Fig. S1H) (32, 33) and host defense against pathogens (32, 34, 35). We found decreased 
concentrations of IL-22 in the BAL fluid of ABX-exposed or GF newborn mice as compared 
to ABX-free newborn mice (Fig. 1F). We confirmed these observations in human newborns, 
finding reduced concentrations of IL-22 in the BAL fluid from human newborns exposed to 
prolonged duration of ABX (Fig. 1G, Table 1).
Reconstitution with intestinal contents from age-matched neonatal mice restored IL-22 
levels in BAL fluid of ABX-exposed or GF newborn mice (Fig. 1G). Similarly, treatment 
with recombinant IL-22 intratracheally restored host resistance to pneumonia in ABX-
exposed newborn mice (Fig. 1H). To interrogate the importance of IL-22 in newborn’s 
resistance to pneumonia, we blocked IL-22 signaling with an IL-22 neutralizing antibody 
(36). Treatment of newborn mice with an anti-IL-22 antibody blocked the restoration of host 
resistance in ABX-exposed newborn mice after reconstitution of intestinal commensal 
bacteria (Fig. 1I). IL-22 acts via a transmembrane receptor complex that consists of 
IL-22R1, a receptor subunit that is shared by related cytokine IL-20 (37). We found no 
difference in concentrations of IL-20 in BAL fluid of ABX-exposed or GF newborn mice 
compared to ABX-free newborn mice (Fig. S1I). Blockade of IL-20 signaling by treatment

 with a neutralizing antibody directed against IL-20 (38) did not block restoration of host 
resistance in ABX-exposed newborn mice after reconstitution of intestinal commensal 
bacteria (Fig. S1J) (36). These findings demonstrate a central and non-redundant role for 
IL-22 in host defense against pneumonia (32, 33) and importantly, implicate IL-22 as a 
critical mediator by which commensal bacteria promote resistance to pneumonia in newborn 
mice . IL-22 bioactivity is negatively regulated by IL-22-binding protein (IL-22BP), a 
secreted receptor that binds to soluble IL-22 with higher affinity than IL-22R1 and functions 
as an antagonist (39). We did not evaluate the role of endogenous IL-22BP in our study. 
Several lung resident immune cells are known to secrete IL-22BP(40), but the role of 
endogenous IL-22BP in pulmonary host defense remains unclear and may represent an 
additional regulatory layer in the ontogeny of lung defense in the newborn.
Disruption of commensal bacteria in the early postnatal period leads to durable changes in 
the repertoire of IL-22 producing immune cells in the lungs of newborn mice, contributing 
to increased susceptibility to pneumonia
The identity of the IL-22-producing cells in the newborn mouse lung is unknown. We found 
that neither neutrophils (CD45+Ly6G+) nor macrophages (CD45+F4/80+) nor T cells 
(CD45+CD4+) were a significant source of IL-22 in the lungs of newborn mice (Fig. 2A). 
The majority of IL-22 producing cells in the murine newborn lung were lineage negative 
(CD45+CD3−CD8−CD11b−CD19−MHCII−F4/80−CD161−Ly6G−) lymphocytes. We further 
characterized these lineage-negative lymphocytes based on expression of surface markers 
CD4, CD117, CD127, NkP46 or CCR6 and transcription factors RORγt, T-Bet or Eomes. 
More than 90% of IL-22 producing cells were lineage negative (CD3−CD8−CD11b
−CD19−MHCII−F4/80−CD161−Ly6G−F4/80−) lymphocytes expressing surface markers 
NKp46, CCR6, CD117 and transcription factor RORγt identifying them as ILC3 lymphoid 
cells (Fig 2A, S2A).
We tested these observations in human newborns. ILC3 
(CD45+CD3−CD8−CD14−CD19−CD69− RORγt+), but not neutrophils 
(CD45+CD3−CD8−CD19−CD69+), NK cells (CD45+CD3−CD8−CD19−CD56+), CD4+ T 
cells (CD45+CD3+CD4+) or CD8+ T cells (CD45+CD8+) were a primary source of IL-22 in 
the lungs of human newborns (Fig. 2B, S2B). These findings illustrate an important 
difference in the cellular sources of IL-22 in the lung of newborn humans compared to adult 
humans, as several groups have reported that NK cells (41), Th17 (42) and γδ T cells (43) 
are the principal sources of IL-22 in adult human lungs.
ILC3 lymphoid cells developmentally depend on RORγT and continuously express this 
transcription factor (44, 45). Therefore, to interrogate the importance of ILC3 in the 
resistance of newborn mice to pneumonia, we bred transgenic mice expressing cre 
recombinase under the control of the RORγt promoter (46) with transgenic mice expressing 
inducible diphtheria toxin receptor (iDTR) (47) to generate RorγtDTR mice. Treatment of 
newborn RorγtDTR mice with diphtheria toxin (DT) decreased the number of ILC3 in the 
lungs (Fig. 2C, S2C), reduced IL-22 in BAL fluid (Fig. S2D) and made the DT-treated 
RorγtDTR newborn mice more susceptible to pneumonia (Fig. 2D). Adoptive transfer of 
lung ILC3 restored host resistance to pneumonia in newborn RorγtDTR mice treated with

 DT (Fig. 2D). Together, these data confirm that IL-22+ILC3 are necessary and sufficient in 
promoting host resistance to pneumonia in newborn mice (48).
We sought to determine if disruption of commensal colonization alters the repertoire of 
IL-22 producing cells in the newborn mouse lung. We found significantly decreased 
(P<0.01) numbers of IL-22+ILC3 (Fig. 2E–G) but not neutrophils or T cells or NK cells (for 
all, P>0.05) (Fig. S2E) in the lungs of ABX-exposed or GF newborn mice as compared to 
ABX-free newborn mice. The decrease in the numbers of IL-22+ILC3 persisted beyond the 
newborn period till at least four weeks of life (Fig. 2E). We confirmed these observations in 
human newborns and found significantly decreased numbers of lung IL-22+ILC3 in the BAL 
fluid of human newborns exposed to prolonged duration of antibiotics (Fig. 2H). We then 
questioned if reversing the commensal disruption would correct the immune alterations in 
ABX-exposed newborn mice. We found that reconstitution with commensal bacteria 
restored the numbers of IL-22+ILC3 in the lungs of ABX-exposed or GF newborn mice 
(Fig. 2F,G), although individual IL-22 expression did not change (Fig. S2F). These data 
illustrate that disruption of commensal bacteria in early postnatal development alters the 
repertoire of IL-22-producing cells in the newborn lungs.
Commensal bacteria direct the postnatal trafficking of IL-22+ILC3 in the murine newborn 
lung
We tested whether reduced numbers of IL-22+ILC3 in the lungs of GF or ABX-exposed 
newborn mice could be explained by differences in proliferation or apoptosis of IL-22+ILC3. 
We assessed cell proliferation or apoptosis by quantifying the number of IL22+ILC3 
lymphoid cells expressing Ki67 or annexin, respectively. We found that an increased number 
of ILC3 in the lungs was not due to changes in proliferation or apoptosis (Fig. S2G). We, 
therefore, hypothesized that a decrease in the absolute numbers of IL-22+ILC3 in ABX-
exposed newborn mice was due to a reduced ability of ILC3 from ABX-exposed newborns 
to traffic preferentially to the lungs. To test this, we used a competitive trafficking assay (49) 
to determine the advantage of ILC3 isolated from ABX-free newborn mice to traffic to the 
lungs as compared to ILC3 from ABX-exposed newborn mice. We found that ILC3 from 
ABX-exposed newborn mice had decreased ability to traffic selectively into the lungs, but 
not the spleen or small intestine as compared to ILC3 isolated from ABX-free newborn mice 
(Fig. 2I,J).
We then asked if reversing the commensal disruption would restore the ability of ILC3 to 
traffic to the lungs. We similarly determined the advantage of ILC3 isolated from ABX-
exposed newborn mice that had received transfer of commensal bacteria to traffic to the 
lungs as compared to ILC3 from ABX-exposed newborn mice that had received no such 
transfer. Reconstitution of commensal bacteria restored the ability of ILC3 from ABX-
exposed newborns to traffic selectively to the lungs (Fig. 2I,J). Tissue-selective ILC3 
trafficking has been described for the small intestine and secondary lymphoid tissues (50, 
51). Our data unveils a role for intestinal commensal bacteria in selective trafficking of ILC3 
into the lungs.

 Commensal bacteria modulate expression of CCR4 on ILC3 lymphoid cells and direct their 
postnatal trafficking into lung
Chemokines control the trafficking and positioning of immune cells and are critical for 
development and recruitment of immune cells in disease (52). We first identified the 
repertoire of chemokine receptors on IL22+ILC3 from the lungs or small intestine (SI) of 
newborn mice. We found that C-C chemokine receptor (CCR) 4 was highly expressed by a 
majority of IL-22+ILC3 from the newborn murine lung but not from the newborn murine SI 
(Fig. S3A). We found no difference in expression of CCR6, 7, 9 or C-C chemokine ligand 
(CCL) 20 nor C-X-C chemokine receptor (CXCR) 3 or 5 on IL-22+ILC3 from the newborn 
lung or SI (Fig. S3A). Tissue-selective ILC3 trafficking has been described for the intestine 
(50, 51), but not for the lungs. Like the intestine, the lung has a large mucosal surface, which 
is in continuous contact with the environment and therefore could potentially benefit from 
lung-selective ILC3 trafficking.
We hypothesized that exposure to commensal bacteria in early life may modulate the 
expression of lung-specific homing receptors on IL-22+ILC3 lymphoid cells and thus 
increase their ability to traffic to the lungs. We examined the numbers and frequencies of 
CCR4 expressing IL22+ILC3 in the lungs of ABX-exposed or ABX-free newborn mice. We 
found that the majority of IL22+ILC3 from the lungs of ABX-free newborn mice were 
CCR4high as compared to the lung ILC3 from ABX-exposed mice or GF mice, which were 
CCR4low (Fig. 3A). We found no difference in expression of CCR6, 7, 9 CCL20, CXCR3 or 
CXCR5 on IL22+ILC3 from the lungs of ABX-free mice or ABX-exposed mice (Fig. 3A). 
CCR4 is critical for homeostatic trafficking of T lymphocytes (53) and Tregs (54) into the 
lungs. CCL17, one of the ligands for CCR4 is expressed by the lung epithelium (55). We 
therefore hypothesized that commensal bacteria use a similar mechanism to direct trafficking 
of ILC3 into the newborn lungs. To test this hypothesis we determined the capability of 
ILC3 isolated from newborn mice lacking CCR4 (Ccr4−/−) to traffic to the lungs as 
compared to ILC3 from age-matched wild-type littermates. We found that ILC3 from 
newborn Ccr4−/− mice had decreased ability to traffic into the lungs as compared to ILC3 
isolated from wildtype littermates (Fig. 3B). Furthermore, the newborn Ccr4−/−mice were 
more susceptible to pneumonia compared to wildtype littermates (Fig. 3C). We then asked if 
an adoptive transfer of wildtype ILC3, which express CCR4 and therefore traffic into the 
lungs, could improve host resistance in newborn Ccr4−/−mice. We found that adoptive 
transfer of ILC3 from wildtype newborn mice to age-matched Ccr4−/−mice restored host 
resistance to pneumonia (Fig. 3C). These data illuminate a role for CCR4 in trafficking of 
ILC3 into the lungs and promoting newborn’s resistance to pneumonia. Nevertheless, the 
origin of ILC3 that traffic to the lungs is unknown. ILC3 are concentrated within the SI (51), 
and the spatial proximity of ILC3 with commensal bacteria in the small intestine supports 
the notion that ILC3 in intestinal mucosa may be directed by the commensal bacteria to 
traffic to the lung.
CD103+CD11b+ DC capture antigen from commensal bacteria and induce expression of 
CCR4 on ILC3
We sought to identify the mechanisms by which intestinal commensal bacteria induce the 
expression of CCR4 on ILC3. Murine ILC3 do not express pattern recognition receptors and

 therefore are unlikely to directly sense the commensal bacteria (56). Mononuclear 
phagocytes like DC and macrophages, not only detect a range of microbial signals (57), but 
can also cross talk with ILC3 in the intestine (58). We found that the majority of 
mononuclear phagocytes in the intestine of newborn mice were CD45+CD11b
+CD103+F4/80− cells (CD103+CD11b+ DC) (Fig. 3D), consistent with previous findings 
(59). Transcription factor ZBTB46 is selectively expressed by CD103+ CD11b+ DCs and 
their committed progenitors but is not expressed by monocytes, macrophages, or other 
lymphoid or myeloid lineages (60, 61). We used mice that express diptheria toxin receptor 
(DTR) under the control of Zbtb46, (Zbtb46DTR), which allows for the depletion of CD103+ 
CD11b+ DC (60) after treatment with DT. Twenty-four hours later, there was a decreased 
number of intestinal CD11b+CD103+ DCs (Fig. S3C). Depletion of CD103+CD11b+ DCs 
was associated with a decrease in IL-22 in the BAL (Fig. S3D), reduced numbers of ILC3 in 
the lungs and increased susceptibility to pneumonia of DT-treated Zbtb46DTR newborn mice 
(Fig. 3E,F). Adoptive transfer of CD103+ CD11b+ DC into age-matched newborn 
Zbtb46DTR mice treated with DT (CD103+CD11b+ DC-depleted newborn mice) restored the 
number of lung ILC3 and improved the resistance of newborn mice to pneumonia (Fig. 
3E,F).
There is increasing evidence that intestinal DCs act as conductors of ILC traffic to the 
intestine and secondary lymphoid tissue (50). We tested whether CD103+CD11b+ DCs 
induced CCR4 expression on IL-22+ILC3. We co-cultured CD103+CD11b+ DCs isolated 
from the small intestine of ABX-free or ABX-exposed newborn mice with ILC3 isolated 
from the lungs of ABX-free or ABX-exposed newborn mice. CD103+CD11b+ DCs isolated 
from the small intestine of ABX-free newborn mice were more efficient than 
CD103+CD11b+ DCs isolated from the small intestine of ABX-exposed newborn mice at 
inducing CCR4 expression on IL-22+ILC3 (Fig. 3G,H) and restoring the ability of lung 
ILC3 from ABX-exposed animals to migrate in response to the CCR4 ligand, CCL17 in 
vitro (Fig. 3I). We found no change in expression of CCR6, 7, 9 CCL20, CXCR3 or CXCR5 
(Fig. 3G). Conversely, co-culture of CD11b+CD103− DCs isolated from small intestine of 
either ABX-free or ABX-exposed newborn mice did not change the CCR4 expression on 
IL-22+ILC3 (Fig. S3E), suggesting CD11b+CD103− DCs were not as efficient as CD11b
+CD103+ DCs at modulating CCR4 expression on IL-22+ILC3. These observations are 
consistent with other reports (62–64), which suggest that distinct DC subsets respond 
differentially to similar environmental cues.
Finally, to test the hypothesis that CD103+CD11b+ DCs capture antigen from commensal 
bacteria and direct the trafficking of ILC3 into the lungs, we treated newborn Zbtb46DTR 
mice with DT before reconstitution with commensal bacteria. Depletion of CD103+CD11b+ 
DCs abrogated the increase in ILC3 number in ABX-exposed newborn Zbtb46DTR mice 
after reconstitution with intestinal commensal bacteria (Fig. 3J). Treatment of Zbtb46DTR 
newborn mice with DT depleted the CD103+CD11b+ DCs in extra-intestinal sites including 
the lungs. CD103+CD11b+ DCs are exceedingly rare in the newborn murine lungs (65). 
Therefore intestinal CD103+CD11b+ DCs, but not lung resident CD103+CD11b+ DCs are 
likely to play a major role in selective trafficking of ILC3 to the lung. Since previous reports 
(66, 67) implicated IL-1β in crosstalk between intestinal mononuclear phagocytes and small 
intestine ILC3, we measured IL-1β in the supernatant from co-cultures of DCs and ILC3.

 We found no difference in the IL-1β levels in co-culture supernatants of CD103+ CD11b+ 
DCs isolated from the small intestine of ABX-free or ABX-exposed newborn mice and co-
cultured with ILC3, (Fig. S3F), suggesting that IL-1β may not be involved in cross-talk 
between DCs and ILC3.
Discussion
Distinct immune responses specifically adapted for fetal and early postnatal life render 
newborns more vulnerable to infection (1). Lack of understanding of immune development 
in early life contributes to our inability to reduce neonatal morbidity due to pneumonia, 
which unfortunately kills more newborns than any other cause. While a series of coordinated 
events control the development of a newborn’s immune system (3), few are as important as 
the interaction with successive waves of commensal bacteria, which colonize the newborn’s 
intestine immediately after birth (4, 5). Disruption of commensal colonization in the critical 
window of the early postnatal period has enduring consequences for the developing immune 
system, exemplified by increased risk of inflammatory disorders like asthma and increased 
risk of respiratory infections beyond infancy in those infants exposed to prolonged antibiotic 
treatment or delivered by caesarean section (10–14). To develop therapeutic interventions to 
decrease morbidity in the newborn period and beyond, we need to better understand the role 
of commensal colonization in the development of the newborn immune system.
Prior studies investigating commensal bacteria-driven immune maturation have prioritized 
the use of GF mice (68). It is now accepted that the immune system while not immature in 
early life, differs fundamentally from immune responses in adults (1). Importantly, the 
newborn’s intestine is colonized by successive waves of diverse commensal bacteria, and 
newborn’s intestinal microbiota is fundamentally distinct from that of adult mice (29). Thus, 
commensal reconstitution studies in adult GF mice do not fully capture the complex 
interaction between the developing host and evolving microbiota. We exposed pregnant 
mouse dams to a combination of ABX, used commonly to treat mother and infants. This not 
only disrupted the sequential colonization of the newborn’s intestine by different commensal 
bacteria but also made the newborn mice more susceptible to pneumonia, replicating the key 
observations from epidemiological studies (10–14). Perhaps more importantly, the 
susceptibility to pneumonia in ABX-exposed newborn mice persisted beyond the newborn 
period, in contrast to previous reports (28) (27), showing that ABX exposure in adult mice 
induced only transient susceptibility to infection. Reversing the commensal disruption 
restored the resistance to pneumonia in the ABX-exposed newborn mice and, importantly, 
this protection persisted beyond the newborn period. These results coupled with other recent 
reports (25, 26) highlight the importance of therapeutic interventions addressing commensal 
dybiosis in early life that have lasting consequences.
T cells (32) and NK cells (41) are primary mediators of innate mucosal defense against 
respiratory pathogens in adults. We found that at birth, the mouse lung is populated by a few 
IL-22+ T cells or NK cells, but is home to a significant number of IL-22+ ILC3 innate 
lymphoid cells. While IL22+ILC3 maintain tissue homeostasis in the small intestine, the role 
of IL22+ILC3 in lung mucosal defense remains a source of controversy (69). ILC3 were 
dispensable for protection against Influenza A pneumonia (70). Reports ascribing an

 important role for ILC3 in lung immune homeostasis have used adult mice deficient in 
recombination activating gene (Rag) 2 or interleukin 2 receptor, gamma (Il2rg) (48, 71), 
which are profoundly immunodeficient, or treated with antiCD90.2 antibodies (35) resulting 
in nonspecific depletion of several immune cell types thus confounding interpretation of 
results from these animals. We, therefore, generated RorγtiDTR mice, a genetic tool to 
selectively deplete ILC3. By first showing that ILC3 depletion in early life rendered the 
newborn mice more susceptible to pneumonia, we were able to demonstrate that IL-22+ 
ILC3 were necessary to promote the resistance of newborn mice to pneumonia. Second, by 
restoring the resistance to pneumonia in ILC3 depleted-newborn mice after adoptive transfer 
of ILC3, we established that ILC3 were sufficient to promote newborn’s resistance to 
pneumonia. One limitation of RorγtiDTR mice is potential depletion of the RORγt+ T cells 
after DT treatment. However, both human newborns (72) as well as murine newborns (73) 
are relatively lymphopenic compared to adults. Absolute numbers of IL22+ T cells were low 
in the newborn mice (Fig. 2B), suggesting that depletion of RORγt+ T cells in our 
RorγtiDTR mice may have had only a marginal effect on the newborn’s resistance to 
infections.
Having shown that ILC3 played a critical role in promoting the resistance of newborn mice 
to pneumonia, we investigated the role of commensal bacteria in the postnatal development 
of lung IL22+ILC3. Several groups have demonstrated that colonization with commensal 
bacteria increased the number of IL22+ILC3 in the small intestine of adult GF mice (74, 75). 
Similarly, an increase in the number of IL-22+ILC3 in the postnatal period has been 
described for the small intestine (76, 77) but not for the lung, raising the possibility that this 
phenomenon is restricted to the newborn’s intestine. Our data challenge this assumption and 
illuminate a role for intestinal commensal bacteria in the postnatal accumulation of 
IL-22+ILC3 in the lungs. We noted an abrupt increase in the number of IL-22+ILC3 in the 
lungs immediately after birth and observed an age-dependent increase in the number of lung 
IL22+ILC3, peaking at two weeks of age. This postnatal increase in lung IL22+ILC3 was 
absent in GF or ABX-exposed newborn mice and was reversed by transfer of commensal 
bacteria in the early postnatal period. Previous studies have used transcriptional activation 
and cytokine production to delineate a role for commensal bacteria in the ontogeny of ILC3 
(75, 76). But tissue selective-trafficking as a mechanism through which commensal bacteria 
direct the ontogeny of ILC3 in postnatal lungs has not been investigated. ILC3 are thought to 
establish residency in the developing intestine by tissue-specific migration (50, 51). We 
show that exposure to commensal bacteria in early life directs the lung-specific IL-22+ ILC3 
trafficking and thus contributes to the postnatal accumulation of IL22+ILC3 in the newborn 
lung. This study did not address the potential role of commensal bacteria in long-term 
maintenance of lung IL-22+ILC3, which needs to be clarified in the context of recent reports 
that ILC homeostasis at peripheral sites is dependent primarily on self-renewal (78).
Small intestine-specific trafficking of ILC3 depends on expression of chemokine receptors 
CCR9 and α4β7 by ILC3 (50). In contrast, we found that lung-specific trafficking of 
IL-22+ILC3 was mediated by CCR4, a homing receptor also used by other immune cells 
(79) for homeostatic trafficking into the lung. CCR4 is activated by chemokine CCL17 or 
CCL20. CCL17 is expressed by the lung epithelium (55). There is evidence that intestinal

 DCs act as conductors of ILC3 traffic to the small intestine and secondary lymphoid tissue 
but not to the lungs (50, 51). We, therefore, evaluated the role of intestinal DCs in instructing 
IL-22+ILC3 to traffic to the lung and found that intestinal CD103+CD11b+ DCs increased 
expression of the lung homing receptor CCR4 by IL-22+ILC3. The ability to up-regulate 
CCR4 expression was dependent on the exposure of intestinal CD103+CD11b+ DCs to 
commensal bacteria as CD103+CD11b+ DCs from ABX-exposed newborn mice failed to 
increase the expression of CCR4 on IL22+ILC3, suggesting that the ability to induce CCR4 
expression and thus direct the tissue-specific migration of IL22+ILC3 is a cell extrinsic 
property. Many factors such as components of bacterial cell walls, bacterial metabolites, and 
intestinal epithelial cell-derived cytokines are known to condition the functional properties 
of CD103+CD11b+ DCs (80). Identification of this signal remains an area of active 
investigation. The role of lung CD103+CD11b+ DCs in lung-specific trafficking of 
IL-22+ILC3 remains unclear. The rarity of CD103+CD11b+ DCs in the newborn murine 
lung (65) precluded us from evaluating whether these cells could induce IL22+ILC3 to 
traffic to the lungs as efficiently as intestinal CD103+CD11b+ DCs, a potential limitation of 
our study.
In conclusion, our data demonstrate the importance of commensal exposure in a defined 
developmental window during the newborn period in the development of pulmonary 
mucosal immunity in mice. We illuminate a critical role for intestinal commensal bacteria in 
lung-selective trafficking of IL22+ILC3. This was mediated by intestinal CD103+CD11b+ 
DCs, which induced expression of the lung homing signal CCR4 on the IL22+ILC3. Lung-
selective trafficking contributed to the postnatal accumulation of IL22+ILC3, promoting the 
newborn’s resistance to pneumonia. These data also potentially explain the association 
between caesarean delivery or widespread use of antibiotics and an increased risk of 
infections in newborn infants. Finally, similar mechanisms could influence the development 
of other pulmonary inflammatory disorders like asthma, which is also associated with 
caesarean delivery and antibiotic use in early life (81) and lead to new therapeutic agents to 
mitigate the risk associated with early-life antibiotic exposure in children.
Materials and Methods
Study design
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical 
Center (CCHMC) approved all the animal studies (IACUC2014-0055), which were carried 
out in accordance with NIH’s Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. We bred 
Rorγt-Cre mice with Rosa26-iDTR mice to generate RorγtiDTR mice. We maintained C57/
BL6, Rosa26-iDTR mice, Rorγt-Cre or Zbtb46DTR mice at CCHMC animal facility. We 
maintained the germ-free (GF) C57/BL6 neonatal mice in plastic isolator cages with 
autoclaved feed and water at CCHMC Germ-Free Core facility. After birth, neonatal mice 
from multiple litters were pooled and redistributed to control for the founder effect and to 
minimize in-cage variations. We used neonatal C57/BL6, Zbtb46DTR, RorγtDTR or GF 
C57/BL6 mice between postnatal ages P1 and P14 and appropriate, age-, sex- and genetic 
strain-matched controls to account for any variations in data. We treated pregnant female 
mice (C57/BL6 or Zbtb46DTR) with sterile drinking water mixed with three different

 antibiotics (ampicillin, gentamicin, and vancomycin; all at 1 mg ml−1) starting from 
embryonic day 15 until the delivery of neonatal mice. We determined group sizes necessary 
for adequate statistical power analysis using preliminary data sets. There was no 
randomization designed in the experiments, and we did not exclude any samples. The 
investigators were not blinded to group allocation during collection and analysis of the data.
Murine neonatal pneumonia studies
We grew S. pneumoniae serotype 19A (ATCC 700674) or E. coli serotype K1 (82) or C. 
albicans (37°C, 200 rpm) in tryptic soy (TS) broth to log-phase growth. To mimic S. 
pneumoniae or E. coli or C. albicans pneumonia, we inoculated neonatal mice (postnatal day 
4 or 14) with either S. pneumoniae serotype 19A (105 CFU g−1) or E. coli (104 CFU g−1) or 
C. albicans (105 CFU g−1) respectively via i.t. route. The animals were examined every 6 h 
for signs of distress and were euthanized 72 h later or earlier if moribund. To assess bacterial 
burden we homogenized the lung in sterile PBS. We plated serial dilutions of lung 
homogenates or BAL fluid in TSB agar plates and incubated (37°C, overnight) to count the 
number of CFU.
We pooled intestinal contents from no ABX-exposed P2 newborn mice. We transferred 
intestinal contents (200 μg in 50 μl PBS) or vehicle (50 μl PBS) to antibiotic-exposed 
neonatal P2 mice by a single oral gavage via fine polyethylene tubing as described before 
(83).
Isolation and characterization of IL-22+ cells in the murine neonatal lung
We pooled and cut the freshly lungs from 3-4 newborn mice and incubated (37 °C, 30 min) 
the cut tissues with shaking (150 r.p.m.) in digestion buffer (RPMI 1640 with 10% FBS, 15 
mM HEPES, 1% penicillin/streptomycin (wt/vol) and 300 U ml−1 collagenase VIII) and 
pressed through a 100-µm nylon strainer to obtain single-cell suspension. The pooled 
preparation constituted a single data point in our analysis. We then incubated (37 °C, 5 h, 
5% CO2) the cells (1 × 107) in culture medium containing RPMI 1640 with 10% FCS, 1× 
nonessential amino acids, 10 mM HEPES, 2 mM L-glutamine (all from Invitrogen) and 1% 
penicillin/streptomycin with 1:1,000 Golgi Stop (554724, BD Biosciences), 10 ng/ml 
phorbol 12-myristate 13-acteate (PMA) and 500 ng/ml calcium ionophore A23187 (both 
from Sigma-Aldrich). We washed and incubated (4 °C, 10 min) the cells (1 × 107) with anti-
mouse CD16/CD32 and then re-incubated (4 °C, 30 min) with anti-mouse CD3 antibody 
(145-2C11), anti–mouse CD4 antibody (GK1.5), anti–mouse CD8 antibody (53–5.8), anti–
mouse CD11b antibody (M1/70), anti–mouse CD19 antibody (6D5), anti-mouse Ly6G 
antibody (1A8), anti-mouse F4/80 antibody (BM8), anti-mouse CD117 antibody (2B8), 
anti–mouse NKp46 antibody (29A1.4), anti-mouse CCR4 antibody (2G12), anti-mouse 
CCR6 antibody (29-2L17), anti-mouse CCR7 antibody (4B12), anti-mouse CCR9 antibody 
(9B1), anti-mouse CCL20 antibody (114906), anti-mouse CXCR3 antibody (173), anti-
mouse CXCR5 antibody (L138D7), anti-mouse Ki67 antibody (16A8) (all diluted 1:100, 
Biolegend). For intracellular staining, we washed and fixed (4 °C, 60 min) the surface-
stained cells in 1× Cytofix/Cytoperm buffer (BD Biosciences) and permeabilized them 
(4 °C, overnight) using 1× Permeabilization Buffer (BD Biosciences) according to 
manufacturer instructions. We stained the cells intracellularly with anti–mouse IL-22

 antibody (5164) or anti–mouse RORγt antibody (Q31-378) or anti-mouse T-bet antibody 
(4B10) or anti-mouse Eomes antibody (WD1928) (all diluted 1:50, Biolegend) and then 
washed (2×) and resuspended them in flow cytometry buffer. We collected the data with 
LSRII (BD Biosciences) and analyzed the data with FlowJo (Treestar).
Isolation and characterization of antigen presenting cells in the murine newborn intestine
We pooled and cut the freshly resected terminal ilea from 3-4 neonatal mice into 2- to 5-mm 
pieces and incubated (37°C,15 min) them in extraction buffer (HBSS, 15 mM HEPES and 1 
mM EDTA) to remove the epithelial cells. We then incubated (37°C, 30 min) the cut tissues 
with shaking (150 rpm) in digestion buffer (RPMI 1640 with 10% FBS, 15 mM HEPES, 1% 
penicillin/streptomycin (wt/vol), and 300 U ml-1 collagenase VIII) and pressed through a 
100-µm nylon strainer to obtain single-cell suspension. The pooled preparation constituted a 
single data point in our analysis. We then incubated (4 °C, 10 min) the cells (1 × 107) with 
anti-mouse CD16/CD32 and then re-incubated (4 °C, 30 min) with anti–mouse CD45 
antibody (30-F11), anti–mouse CD103 antibody (2E7), anti-mouse CD11b antibody 
(M1/70), anti-mouse CD11c antibody (N418), anti-mouse MHCII antibody (M5/114.15.2), 
anti–mouse F4/80 antibody (BM8) and anti-mouse CX3CR1(SA011F11) (all diluted 1:100, 
Biolegend) and then washed (2×) and resuspended them in flow cytometry buffer. We 
collected the data with LSRII (BD Biosciences) and analyzed the data with FlowJo 
(Treestar).
Treatment of neonatal mice with neutralizing antibodies, recombinant IL-22 or diphtheria 
toxin
We injected neonatal B6 mice with an anti-IL22 antibody (8E11, a gift from Wenjun 
Ouyang) or anti-IL20 antibody (Clone PA5-47092, Invitrogen) or anti-IgG2A (54447, R&D) 
(all 5 μg per g body weight) via i.p. route on P1. For specific cell depletion, we treated 
neonatal RorγtiDTR or Zbtb46DTR mice with diphtheria toxin (1.5 ng, R&D) or vehicle via 
i.p. route on P1. We assessed ablation efficiency by flow cytometry 24 h later. For gain of 
function studies, we treated ABX-exposed neonatal mice with recombinant IL-22 (10 μg per 
g body weight) (cat. 414-CS, R&D) or vehicle via i.t. route on P2.
Adoptive transfer of ILC3 or CD103+CD11b+ DCs
For adoptive transfer, we pooled lungs or SI from 8-10 P2 newborn mice. We harvested 
approximately 1 × 106 Lin−CCR6+ from the pooled specimens by positive and negative 
selection as done previously by other groups (71). This resulting cell population was > 97% 
enriched for ILC3 (71). We harvested 1 × 107 intestinal CD103+CD11b+ DC from the 
pooled SI specimens by positive and negative selection as done previously (84). We 
adoptively transferred Lin−CCR6+ cells (0.5 × 106 cells/animal) or CD103+CD11b+ DC (0.5 
× 106 cells/animal) via i.p. route on P2.
In vivo ILC3 migration assay
We first isolated lung Lin−CCR6+ cells (>97% ILC3) by positive and negative selection as 
done previously (71). We then incubated (37 °C, 20 min) ILC3 (1 × 107) from P3 GF or 
ABX-exposed newborns with carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (CFSE) (5 mM). We

 incubated ILC3 from control (ABX-free) neonatal mice with chloromethyl-benzoyl-amino-
tetramethylrhodamine (CMMTR) (10 mM). We quenched with an equal volume of 10% 
FBS, diluted 10 × with PBS and resuspended the cells in RPMI1640, supplemented with 2% 
FBS and 2 mM glutamine. We co-injected 106 cells of each population into ABX-exposed 
neonatal mice via i.p. route. We euthanized host mice 24 h. later and determined the 
numbers of injected ILC3 migrating into the lungs, spleen and SI by flow cytometry as done 
previously (50). We calculated the relative homing index as follows. [CFSE+ ILC3 in organ 
A]/[CMMTR+ ILC3 in organ A] ÷ [CFSE+ ILC3 in injected cells]/[CMMTR+ ILC3 in 
injected cells] as described before (49). We performed similar experiments after 
reconstitution of commensal bacteria and with lung Lin−CCR6+ cells from Ccr4−/− or WT 
mice.
Cell co-culture and chemotaxis assay
We isolated Lin−CCR6+ cells (>97%ILC3) from lungs (71) or CD103+CD11b+CD11c+ cells 
from the intestine of ABX-exposed or ABX-free newborn mice (P4). We then co-cultured 
lung ILC3 and intestinal CD103+CD11b+ DC or CD103−CD11b+ (105 cells each) in 
following combinations (ILC3 from ABX mice + DC from no-ABX mice, ILC3 from ABX-
mice + DC from ABX mice or ILC3 from ABX-free mice + DC from ABX-free mice or 
ILC3 from ABX-free mice + DC from ABX mice, ILC3 from ABX or ABX-free mice alone 
or DC from ABX and ABX-free mice alone) in round-bottom plates in RPMI1640 
supplemented with 2% FBS, 2 mM glutamine, and 50 µM β-mercaptoethanol. We harvested 
the supernatants and incubated the remaining cells were incubated with Golgi Plug and 
subsequently analyzed by flow cytometry. For chemotaxis assay, we loaded ILC3 (106 cells 
in 100 μl RPMI 2% FBS) into transwell inserts with pore size of 5 μm (Corning Transwell) 
and placed in wells containing ±20 nM CCL17 in RPMI1640, supplemented with 2% FBS, 2 
mM glutamine, and 50 µM β-mercaptoethanol. We incubated (2 h, 37 °C) the plates and then 
analyzed the migrated and input cells by flow cytometry. We expressed results as 
percentages of ILC3 in migrated wells as compared to input wells as described before (50).
Sample collection and analysis of commensal bacteria in the lungs and small intestine of 
newborn mice
Given the technical challenges in collecting adequate bio specimens for 16s sequencing from 
newborn mice, we opted to pool bio-specimens from 8-10 newborn mice from 3 separate 
litters per treatment group. An unexpected benefit of this approach is the control of 
variations in the commensal bacteria attributed to founder and cage effect (85). We collected 
the entire left lobe of the lung using one heat treated sterile scissor per animal as described 
previously by other groups (86). We then cut open the terminal ileum using sterile scissors 
and removed the intestinal contents using sterile plastic loops as done previously (29). We 
snap froze (−80°C) the specimens for subsequent analysis (−80°C). We extracted the 
bacterial DNA from the whole lung or the intestinal contents using QIAamp DNA stool 
Mini Kit (Qiagen) using a previously described protocol (86) and quantified 16S ribosomal 
(r) DNA by RT-PCR using degenerate primers as described before (87). To analyze the 
commensal bacteria, we amplified the V2 region of microbial 16S rRNA by high fidelity 
PCR with barcoded 8F and 338R universal primers with A and B sequencing adaptors 
respectively and bifido primers (Roche) and sequenced them with Genome Sequencer GS-

 FLX Titanium system (Roche) at University of North Carolina Microbiome core facility 
(Chapel Hill, NC). The reagents used for DNA extraction, polymerase chain reaction and 
sequencing reaction are a common source of contamination in microbiome sequencing 
studies (88). To control for variation in the reagents, we processed all the samples using a 
common batch of DNA extraction reagents and PCR reagents. We included appropriate 
controls including a negative control (no template) and positive community control 
(intestinal contents from age-matched mice) from each batch of harvested tissues when 
performing 16 rRNA PCR or 16S rRNA sequencing. We decoded and processed the 
sequences using the QIIME software package (Version 1.7) and custom R package code 
(89). Analysis of the sequences from negative control indicated presence of several bacterial 
species suggesting potential contamination from the DNA extraction or sequencing reagents. 
The dominant bacterial species in the negative control were Rhodocyclae (17%), Rhizobiales 
(15%) Argobacterium (14%), Micrococcus (10%), Hydrogenophilus (9%), Neiserria (5%), 
Lysinibacillus (4%), Micrococcus (4%) and Tenericutes (4%). The relative abundance of 
these contaminants in experimental samples was less than 3% (Supplemental Table 1) and 
thus unlikely to alter the conclusions. We used phylogenetic diversity (PD) to compute and 
visualize α diversity and unweighted and weighted Unifrac for β diversity. We tested the 
observed differences in Unifrac distances between antibiotic treated groups and across 
different ages for significance using a t-test, and we corrected the reported P values for 
multiple comparisons using a Monte Carlo permutation procedure with 10,000 iterations. 
We deposited all data sets in a publicly available database (Figshare) and can be accessed at 
https://figshare.com/s/52f4aa2f8035fd505cf1.
Transcriptomic analysis
We sequenced high-quality RNA from the whole lung at CCHMC Sequencing Core Facility 
with an Illumina HiSeq 2500. We performed data alignment with TopHat, followed by gene 
quantification (FPKM) using Cufflinks. We carried out differential expression analysis with 
both FPKM and read count-based methods. We performed pathway and network analyses 
with Altanalyze as described before (90). We deposited all data sets in a publicly available 
database (Figshare) and can be accessed at https://figshare.com/s/52f4aa2f8035fd505cf1.
Human newborn studies
The Institutional review board at CCHMC approved all the human studies. The biological 
samples were initially collected from infants who underwent clinical evaluation of either 
upper airway obstruction or tracheaobronchomalacia, common anomalies of the airways in 
infants, after obtaining informed consent from the parents (IRB approval #2013-3309). The 
bronchial lavage (BAL) fluid samples were centrifuged (4°C, 10 min, 400 g). The resultant 
supernatant was frozen (−80 °C) and the cells were cryopreserved (−150 °C) in 90% FBS 
and 10% DMSO. We used the frozen supernatant and cryopreserved cells in our analysis 
(IRB approval #2015-7983). Since pneumonia (48) and asthma (71) are associated with 
ILC3 activation in the lungs, we excluded infants with a history of pneumonia (defined as 
worsening of respiratory status, increase or change in the quality of respiratory secretions, 
temperature instability with radiographic changes) or wheezing. We then selected infants 
who received antibiotics (ABX-exposed group) or no antibiotics (No ABX-group) and 
matched the respective treatment groups for gestational age, age at the time of procedure and

After thawing, we incubated (37°C, 5 h, 5% CO2) the cells (0.5 × 106) in culture medium 
containing RPMI 1640 with 10% FCS, 1× nonessential amino acids, 10 mM HEPES, 2 mM 
L-glutamine (all from Invitrogen) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin with 1:1,000 Golgi Stop 
(554724, BD Biosciences), 10 ng/ml phorbol 12-myristate 13-acteate (PMA) and 500 ng/ml 
calcium ionophore A23187. We immunophenotyped the cells in BAL fluid as described 
before (91). We stained cells with anti-human CD3 antibody (SP34-2), anti-human CD8 
antibody (B9.11), anti-human CD14 antibody (RMO52), anti-human CD19 antibody 
(J3-119), anti-human CD45 antibody (J.33), anti-human CD56 antibody (NK901), anti-
human CD69 antibody (TP1.55.3) and anti-human NKp46 antibody (9E2) (all diluted 
1:1000, Biolegend). For intracellular staining, we washed and fixed (4 °C, 60 min) the 
surface-stained cells in 1× Cytofix/Cytoperm buffer (BD Biosciences) and permeabilized 
them (4 °C, overnight) using 1× Permeabilization Buffer (BD Biosciences) according to 
manufacturer’s instructions. We stained the cells intracellularly with anti-human RORγt 
antibody (AFKJS-9), anti-human T-bet antibody (4B10) and anti-human IL-22 antibody 
(BG/IL22) (all diluted 1:50, Biolegend) and then washed (2×) and resuspended them in flow 
cytometry buffer. We collected the data with LSRII (BD Biosciences) and analyzed the data 
with FlowJo (Treestar).
ELISA
We measured IL-22 or IL-20 in the murine (69) or human BAL fluid (92) using 
commercially available kits (eBioscience) as described before. We measured IL-1β in the 
cell culture supernatant using commercially available kits (eBioscience) as per 
manufacturer’s instructions.
Statistical analyses
Each data point represents a pool of 3-4 newborn mice that were pooled before the isolation 
of leukocytes from the indicated tissue. All data met the assumptions of the statistical tests 
used. We compared differences between groups by either unpaired two-tailed Student’s t-test 
or ANOVA or Wilcoxon signed-rank test. We used the Kaplan-Meier log-rank test to 
compare survival between groups. (All in GraphPad Prism 6.0). P-values are indicated as

 Accessible Summary
Interactions between host and intestinal commensals shape the development of immune 
cells in intestine. We report that host-commensal interactions extend beyond the local 
environment and shape the repertoires of immune cells at extra-intestinal sites like the 
lungs. Exposure to commensals in the developmental window of newborn period directs 
lung-selective trafficking of innate lymphoid cells (ILC3), a group of sentinel cells that 
maintain mucosal homeostasis. This was mediated by intestinal DCs, which induced 
expression of the lung homing signal CCR4 on the ILC3. Lung-selective ILC3 trafficking 
promoted the newborn’s resistance to pneumonia. These data explain the association 
between widespread use of antibiotics and an increased risk of pneumonia in newborn 
infants.
