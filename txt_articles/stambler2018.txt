ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND There is no nonparenteral medication for the rapid termination of paroxysmal supraventricular
tachycardia.
OBJECTIVES The purpose of this study was to assess the efficacy and safety of etripamil nasal spray, a short-acting
calcium-channel blocker, for the rapid termination of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (SVT).
METHODS This phase 2 study was performed during electrophysiological testing in patients with previously docu-
mented SVT who were induced into SVT prior to undergoing a catheter ablation. Patients in sustained SVT for 5 min
received either placebo or 1 of 4 doses of active compound. The primary endpoint was the SVT conversion rate within
15 min of study drug administration. Secondary endpoints included time to conversion and adverse events.
RESULTS One hundred four patients were dosed. Conversion rates from SVT to sinus rhythm were between 65% and
95% in the etripamil nasal spray groups and 35% in the placebo group; the differences were statistically significant
(Pearson chi-square test) in the 3 highest active compound dose groups versus placebo. In patients who converted, the
median time to conversion with etripamil was <3 min. Adverse events were mostly related to the intranasal route of
administration or local irritation. Reductions in blood pressure occurred predominantly in the highest etripamil dose.
CONCLUSIONS Etripamil nasal spray rapidly terminated induced SVT with a high conversion rate. The safety and efficacy
results of this study provide guidance for etripamil dose selection for future studies involving self-administration of this new
intranasal calcium-channel blocker in a real-world setting for the termination of SVT. (Efficacy and Safety of Intranasal

urrently, there is no short-acting,
nonparenteral
drug
available
for
the acute termination of supraven-
tricular tachycardia (SVT) that can be self-
administered. Such a drug would provide
individuals the ability to rapidly terminate
SVT episodes without the need to visit a
health care facility.
Etripamil
(Milestone
Pharmaceuticals,
Montreal St.-Laurent, Quebec, Canada) is a
short-acting L-type calcium-channel blocker
with a rapid onset of action designed for intranasal
administration. It has been formulated as a nasal
spray for self-administration by patients who expe-
rience SVT recurrences. It has a high potency and a
short first half-life of about 20 min. Like other non-
dihydropyridine calcium-channel blockers, etripamil
slows atrioventricular nodal conduction and prolongs
atrioventricular nodal refractory periods by inhibiting
calcium ion influx through the calcium slow channels
in the atrioventricular node cells. A phase 1 trial in
healthy
volunteers
demonstrated
that
intranasal
administration of etripamil was well tolerated and
caused a dose-dependent PR interval prolongation
indicative of the desired pharmacological effect on
atrioventricular
nodal
conduction.
There
was
no
observed prolongation of QRS or Fredericia-corrected
QT interval.
NODE-1 (Efficacy and Safety of Intranasal MSP-2017
[Etripamil] for the Conversion of PSVT to Sinus
Rhythm) was a phase 2 study designed to demon-
strate the superiority of etripamil over placebo for the
acute termination of SVT in the electrophysiology
laboratory, evaluate the safety of etripamil, and
identify dose(s) to be tested in future phase 3 studies
to be conducted outside the hospital environment.
METHODS
STUDY DESIGN AND PATIENTS. NODE-1 (NCT02296190)
was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-
controlled, dose-ranging study designed to evaluate
the effects of etripamil nasal spray in male and female
patients 18 years of age and older with documented
histories of SVT who were scheduled to undergo elec-
trophysiological studies prior to planned catheter
ablation. The exclusion criteria were a history of
adverse reaction to intravenous (IV) verapamil, a sig-
nificant or chronic condition of the nasal cavity that
would interfere with intranasal drug administration,
systolic blood pressure (SBP) <100 mm Hg or diastolic
blood pressure <50 mm Hg at screening or at the treat-
ment visit, history or evidence of congestive heart
failure (except New York Heart Association functional
class I) or pulmonary edema, a prolonged Bazett-
corrected QT interval (>455 ms), ventricular pre-
excitation, second- or third-degree atrioventricular
block, pregnancy, breastfeeding, failure to agree to
use an acceptable form of contraception, concomitant
use of certain medications (e.g., digoxin, class I to IV
antiarrhythmic
drug),
and
documentation
of
an
arrhythmia other than SVT.
This study was carried out in accordance with In-
ternational Conference on Harmonisation of Technical
Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for
Human Use and Good Clinical Practice guidelines. All
sites obtained Institutional Review Board or ethics
committee approval, and study-specific procedures
were not conducted until after patient informed con-
sent was obtained. A complete list of study sites and
primary
investigators

Appendix.
RANDOMIZATION. During a pre-study visit patients
were randomly assigned to 1 of the 5 following study
groups in a 1:1:1:1:1 ratio using an interactive web
response system: placebo or etripamil at 35, 70, 105,
or 140 mg.
BASELINE ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL STUDY DATA
COLLECTION. Before attempted induction of SVT,
vital signs, consisting of blood pressure and heart rate,
were recorded, and a continuous surface rhythm strip
was obtained. Baseline vital signs were the averages of
the measurements taken 10 and 20 min before SVT
induction, and the time 0 vital signs were the averages
of the measurements during SVT between 5 and 0 min
before study drug administration. Sedation could be
given during the study via single or multiple admin-
istrations using minimally necessary doses of benzo-
diazepines
and/or
narcotics
at
the
investigator’s
discretion, but a continuous sedative or analgesic or
inhaled anesthetic drug was not permitted until min-
ute 30 after study drug administration.
SVT INDUCTION. Induction of SVT was attempted
using standard pacing and programmed stimulation
methods.
If
SVT
could
not
be
induced
after
a
reasonable number of attempts, or could be induced
but did not sustain for 5 min, IV isoproterenol was
infused at a rate of 1 mg/min, and attempts to induce
SVT were repeated. If SVT induction was unsuccess-
ful with isoproterenol 1 mg/min, the infusion rate
could be increased. If isoproterenol was used, a sur-
face rhythm strip was collected once the heart rate
had
stabilized.
If
induction
was
successful

 isoproterenol, the infusion was continued at 1 mg/min
for 5 min of sustained SVT and continuing for either
15
min after
study
drug administration
or
until
termination of SVT, whichever occurred first.
STUDY DRUG ADMINISTRATION. After a minimum of
5 min in sustained SVT, electrophysiology laboratory
personnel administered the study drug to the patient
using 4 prefilled Aptar Pharma unit-dose spray de-
vices via alternating nares over 30 s or less. Each
device delivered 100 ml of placebo or 35 mg of etri-
pamil. The appropriate combination of 4 devices
containing active compound or placebo was used to
deliver the assigned, randomized dose of etripamil (0,
35, 70, 105, or 140 mg). The devices were prefilled,
packaged into drug kits, and administered in a spe-
cific order, with sprays of etripamil delivered before
sprays containing placebo.
ASSESSMENTS AFTER STUDY DRUG ADMINISTRATION.
Starting at time 0, vital signs were recorded every
2 min for 30 min, and the cardiac rhythm was
continuously monitored. A successful conversion was
defined as conversion of SVT to sinus rhythm lasting
at least 30 s within 15 min after study drug adminis-
tration. For patients who did not convert within
15 min after study drug administration, SVT was then
terminated
by
standard
intracardiac
stimulation
techniques. Surface rhythm strips were collected in
all patients at the time of conversion and at 15 min
after study drug administration. At any time beyond
30 min after study drug administration, the patient’s
scheduled ablation (outside the scope of this study)
could be performed at the discretion of the treating
physician.
FOLLOW-UP PROCEDURES. From 12 h to 5 days after
the procedure, physical examination, assessment of
vital signs, 12-lead electrocardiography, and clinical
laboratory analysis were performed. Adverse events
and concomitant medications were recorded.
STATISTICAL
METHODS. Efficacy
analyses
were
performed in randomized patients in whom SVT was
induced and sustained for 5 min, had received study
drug, and completed the assessment of conversion to
sinus rhythm (i.e., evaluable population). Safety an-
alyses were based on all randomized patients who
were induced into SVT and received study drug.
Sample size determination. It was expected that
there would be a 50 percentage point difference in the
SVT conversion rate between patients receiving pla-
cebo and any dose of etripamil within 15 min after
study drug administration (i.e., 30% for placebo, 80%
for etripamil). Accounting for a 2-sided test with a
type I error rate of a ¼ 0.05, 20 patients per group
provided 84% power when using the Fisher exact
test. Therefore, a sample size of at least 100 evaluable
patients (i.e., at least 20 evaluable patients per group)
was considered appropriate to meet study objectives.
Statistical analyses. The primary efficacy endpoint
was the rate of successful SVT conversion to sinus
rhythm lasting at least 30 s within 15 min of study
drug administration. The primary efficacy analysis
was performed using the Fisher exact test to compare
the conversion rate between each etripamil group and
the placebo group. To control the type I error rate of
a ¼ 0.05, a hierarchical procedure was used for hy-
pothesis testing. The hierarchy first compared the
conversion rate in the highest etripamil dose (140 mg)
versus placebo; if that comparison resulted in a
p
value
<0.05,
the
next
highest
etripamil
dose
(105 mg) was compared with placebo. These com-
parisons continued in a stepwise fashion until either
all doses were tested or a comparison yielded a
p value of $0.05, in which case all doses prior to that
comparison were considered to have statistically
significant conversion rates versus placebo. A 2-sided
test with a significance level of 0.05 was used for each
comparison. The odds ratio (OR), 95% confidence in-
terval (CI), and p value for the OR were calculated and
tabulated for each pairwise treatment comparison.
Conversion rates were analyzed using a Cochran-
Mantel-Haenszel test and stratified by isoproterenol
to test for an association between treatment and
conversion rate. Secondary and exploratory efficacy
analyses were performed as follows. 1) The Cochran-
Armitage test for trend was used to assess the
presence of an association between conversion rate
and the etripamil dose groups. 2) The dose-response
relationship (percentage conversion at time 15) was
assessed using a generalized linear model with logit
link and binomial distribution. 3) Time to conversion
was summarized for patients whose SVT was suc-
cessfully converted to sinus rhythm after study drug
administration. The distribution of conversion times
from initiation of treatment to SVT termination and
conversion to sinus rhythm during a 15-min period of
observation was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier
method. Patients who did not convert within 15 min
after study drug administration were censored at that
time point. In a post hoc analysis, the hazard ratio and
95% CI were based on a Cox proportional hazards
regression model with treatment as a factor. 4) The
interaction test between etripamil and isoproterenol
was carried out in an analysis-of-covariance model.

marized with frequency counts.

 RESULTS
BASELINE PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS. A total of
199 patients were randomized into the double-blind
study; 95 patients withdrew prior to dosing: 70
patients because of inability to induce (n ¼ 42) or
sustain (n ¼ 28) SVT, 5 patients on the basis of
physician discretion, 1 patient lost to follow-up, 1
because of withdrawal of consent, and 18 patients for
other reasons. A total of 104 patients had SVT induced
and sustained for $5 min and were dosed with study
drug. The median age was 55.0 years (mean 52.2;
range: 19 to 85 years), and the median body mass
index was 28.57 kg/m2 (mean 29.35 kg/m2; range: 19.0
to 64.1 kg/m2). Overall, there were more female than
male patients (n ¼ 59 [56.7%] vs. n ¼ 45 [43.3%],
respectively). The predominant races were white
(80.8%) and black or African American (12.5%). There
were no imbalances in baseline characteristics across
the 5 treatment groups. Isoproterenol was given to
46.2% of patients. The mean heart rate in SVT at time
0 was 177 beats/min in the placebo group and 168,
173, 180, and 155 beats/min in the etripamil 35-, 70-,
105-, and 140-mg groups, respectively. The mecha-
nism of induced SVT
was
atrioventricular
nodal
re-entrant tachycardia in 87% of patients. A total of
29 sites dosed patients. Twenty-six sites dosed be-
tween 1 and 5 patients, and 3 sites dosed between 10
and 13 patients (i.e., 33% of the study population).
The
percentage
of
patients
dosed by number of
patients per site is shown in Figure 1.
EFFICACY. Conversion rates from SVT to sinus
rhythm. Of the 104 patients in the evaluable popu-
lation, 20 received etripamil 35 mg, 23 received
70 mg, 20 received 105 mg, 21 received 140 mg, and 20
received placebo. The percentages of patients in
whom SVT converted to sinus rhythm within 15 min
after study drug administration and in whom sinus
rhythm was maintained for at least 30 s (primary ef-
ficacy endpoint) were 35%, 65%, 87%, 75%, and 95%
in the placebo and etripamil 35-, 70-, 105-, and 140-
mg groups, respectively (Table 1). Applying the pre-
specified hierarchy for determining significance, the
3 highest etripamil doses of 140, 105, and 70 mg
showed
statistically
significant
higher
conversion
rates
compared
with
placebo,
with
respective
conversion rate differences from placebo of 60%
(OR: 37.14; 95% CI: 3.84 to 1,654.17; p < 0.0001),
40% (OR: 5.57; 95% CI: 1.19 to 27.63; p ¼ 0.0248),
and
52%
(OR:
12.38;
95%
CI:
2.28
to
82.26;
p ¼ 0.0006). There was a statistically significant
trend
between
treatment
with
etripamil
and
conversion to sinus rhythm (p < 0.0001, Cochran-
Armitage test). A maximal-efficacy dose-response
model best fit the dose-response relationship; the
conversion rate increased with the dose with a steep
slope until 70 mg and reached a plateau at higher
doses (Figure 2).
Overall, no differences in conversion rates were
observed on the basis of the administration or lack of
administration of isoproterenol.

etripamil doses with statistically significant conver-
sion rates compared with placebo (70, 105, and

 was <3 min, with the shortest time in the etripamil
140-mg group (1.8 min). Because only 35% patients
converted to sinus rhythm within 15 min in the pla-
cebo group, the time at which 50% of patients con-
verted cannot be determined.
Distribution of time to conversion for each patient
is reported as a Kaplan-Meier plot (Figure 3). Patients
who did not convert within 15 min after study drug
administration were censored at 15 min. On the basis
of a Cox proportional hazards regression model with
treatment as a factor, the 3 highest etripamil doses of
140, 105, and 70 mg showed statistically significant
shorter time to conversion compared with placebo
(Table 2).
SAFETY. At
least
1
adverse
event,
per
patient,
considered related to the study drug according to the
investigators’ assessment, was reported in 17 patients
(85.0%) in the etripamil 35-mg group, 18 (78.3%) in
the 70-mg group, 15 (75.0%) in the 105-mg group, 20
(95.2%) in the 140-mg group, and 4 (20.0%) in the
placebo group. The incidence of adverse events was
not dose dependent.
Most adverse events were mild (44.2%) or moder-
ate (24.0%) across all treatment groups. A total of 3
severe
adverse
events
were
considered
possibly
related to etripamil. One patient who received 35 mg
experienced facial flushing, shortness of breath, and
chest discomfort; 1 patient who received 105 mg had
nausea and vomiting; and 1 patient who received
105 mg had a serious adverse event of cough. There
were no adverse events that led to study discontin-
uation or death.
Adverse events that occurred with an incidence of
>10% in any etripamil group and $10% in the placebo
group
were
nasal
discomfort,
nasal
congestion,
oropharyngeal pain, rhinorrhea, cough, dysgeusia,
increased lacrimation, vomiting, and nausea. One
patient had an episode of second-degree atrioven-
tricular block with hypotension beginning 5 min after
conversion to sinus rhythm immediately following
administration of etripamil 140 mg, which resolved
after
43
min,
and
ablation
was
subsequently
performed.
Vital signs were recorded before induction into
SVT and every 2 min for 30 min after study drug was
given. The mean SBP decreased from the baseline
measurements (20 and 10 min before SVT induction)
to measurements done while in SVT before study
drug administration (time 0). Compared with baseline
prior to SVT induction, SBP measurements recorded
from 2 to 16 min after study drug administration
demonstrated no statistically significant decrease in
mean SBP in the placebo, 35-mg, and 70-mg groups,
and a maximum statistically significant decrease of
17 mm Hg 6 min post-dose when 65% of the patients
were in sinus rhythm in the 105-mg group, and
20 mm Hg 6 min post-dose when 80% of the patients
were in sinus rhythm in the 140-mg group. There was
no decrease in mean SBP compared with baseline
from 16 to 30 min after study drug administration
when all the patients were in sinus rhythm (Figure 4).
In the placebo group and the combined active
substance groups, the minimum mean heart rates
(84.7 and 82.4 beats/min, respectively) were similar.
The minimum heart rate in any individual patient
occurring within 30 min after study drug adminis-
tration was 58 beats/min in the placebo group and 70,
55, 71, and 47 beats/min in the etripamil 35-, 70-, 105-,
and 140-mg groups, respectively. There was no sta-
tistically significant change between baseline and
15
min
post-dose
in
mean
Bazett-corrected
QT
intervals.
DISCUSSION
In this study, the 3 highest doses of etripamil tested
demonstrated the ability to terminate SVT with very
high and statistically significant conversion rates
compared with placebo (Central Illustration). The
median time to conversion for each of the etripamil
doses was <3 min. From an efficacy standpoint, this
makes this intranasal calcium-channel blocker an

 excellent drug candidate to fill the existing gap in
therapy for the rapid termination of SVT outside of
the health care setting. Judicious selection of etripa-
mil doses in future studies may be able to mitigate
decreases in SBP, which occurred most often and for
the longest duration in the etripamil 140-mg group.
During the course of the study it was recognized
that the discomfort and cough possibly related to the
presence of the drug in the throat could be dramati-
cally reduced by elevating the head of the bed to 30�,
keeping the chin close to the chest, and trying to
avoid inhaling or swallowing the drug. It is conceiv-
able that providing patients with this information
could reduce or eliminate these adverse events in the
future.
ETRIPAMIL PHARMACOLOGY AND CHARACTERISTICS.
Etripamil is a short-acting, phenylalkylamine class
L-type
calcium-channel
blocker.
It
follows
a
2-
compartment pharmacokinetic model with a time
to maximum plasma concentration of approximately
8 min and a mean first half-life of about 20 min across
all doses tested when administered intranasally. The
drug is metabolized by ubiquitous serum esterases,
and the major metabolite is an inactive carboxylic
acid. Dose-dependent side effects (nasal congestion,
oropharyngeal pain) are most likely related to the
intranasal route of administration. Neither animal nor
human studies demonstrated prolongation of the QRS
duration or corrected QT interval. The shelf life of
etripamil is >1 year.

 CURRENT TREATMENTS FOR SVT. All medications
currently approved for the acute termination of SVT
must be administered in the presence of a trained
health care professional and require the establish-
ment
of
IV
access
along
with
real-time
rhythm
monitoring. IV beta-blockers and calcium-channel
blockers are effective for acute treatment in patients
with hemodynamically stable SVT. Oral beta-blockers
and calcium-channel blockers alone or in combina-
tion may be self-administered (“pill-in-the-pocket”)
for acute treatment of well-tolerated SVT, with mean
times to conversion of approximately 30 min or
longer, but the overall efficacy and safety of the self-
administration of these medications remains unclear
because of the lack of scientific evidence and poten-
tial risk for hypotension and/or syncope (1,2). Anti-
arrhythmic drugs such as flecainide, which are not
approved for this indication, have been used as a
“pill-in-pocket” strategy (3), but with small studies
showing variable conversion rates of about 50%,
often approximating the placebo conversion rate.
Mean conversion times were 1 h or longer, although
by 2 h up to 80% of patients may spontaneously
convert. Additionally, multiple factors limit the abil-
ity to prescribe these and other antiarrhythmic drugs:
known or suspected coronary artery disease, left
ventricular dysfunction, borderline or prolonged QT
interval, and unfavorable or unknown metabolizer
status.
FUTURE
EVALUATION. Etripamil will need to be
evaluated
in
future
studies
that
are
performed
outside
of
the
electrophysiology
laboratory
in
nonsupine,
nonsedated
patients
to
confirm
its
efficacy in a real-world environment and to demon-
strate
an
appropriate
safety
profile
for
self-
administration
without
medical
supervision.
The
observed balance between efficacy and safety in
the 70-mg group makes this dose a good candidate
for future studies.
STUDY LIMITATIONS. This study was carried out
during an electrophysiology study prior to a planned
ablation in a carefully monitored and controlled
hospital environment, which introduced elements
that differ from the real-world setting in which
etripamil nasal spray might ultimately be used. The
use of conscious sedation in the electrophysiology
laboratory reduces circulating catecholamines (4,5),
which could alter the time to spontaneous conver-
sion along with the etripamil-related conversion rate
due to effects on atrioventricular node conduction
properties. Sedation may also predispose patients to
hypotension, which may not be seen in a non-
procedural
setting.

 movement causing SVT termination exists, which
could affect efficacy results. It is conceivable that at
least some of the adverse events associated with
drug administration (i.e., supine position) could be
eliminated or minimized if patients are allowed to
self-administer the drug in a more optimal position
outside of the electrophysiology laboratory envi-
ronment. Because all patients were converted, per
protocol, by overdrive pacing after 15 min in SVT,
the
time
to
spontaneous
conversion
for
the
13
remaining
patients
who
received
placebo
is
un-
known. Analysis of the time to conversion, for pa-
tients who were inducible into sustained SVT, was
limited to 15 min in this proof-of-concept study,
which could be considered too short to evaluate the
spontaneous
time
to
conversion
in
the
placebo
group. Almost 90% of patients had atrioventricular
nodal re-entrant tachycardia, and thus the efficacy
and safety in AVRT was less well established in this
study.
CONCLUSIONS
Etripamil,
an
intranasally
administered,
L-type
calcium-channel blocker, demonstrated high efficacy
for rapid SVT termination and conversion to sinus
rhythm and was generally well tolerated. The results of
this study are promising and support the ongoing
development of this new intranasal calcium-channel
blocker for the acute termination of SVT, with a goal of
providing this therapy for patient self-administration
in the “real world” outside a health care setting. This
has the potential to change the treatment paradigm for
the acute management of SVT.

PERSPECTIVES
COMPETENCY IN MEDICAL KNOWLEDGE: Etri-
pamil, a short-acting calcium-channel blocker, when
administered as a nasal spray, is more effective than
placebo in terminating induced SVT, though a high
dose was associated with lowering of blood pressure.
TRANSLATIONAL OUTLOOK: Larger clinical
studies are needed to confirm the safety and efficacy
of etripamil nasal spray for termination of spontane-
ously occurring episodes of SVT.
