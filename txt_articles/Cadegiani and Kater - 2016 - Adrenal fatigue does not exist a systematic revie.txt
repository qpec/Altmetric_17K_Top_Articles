Adrenal fatigue does not exist: a systematic
review
Flavio A. Cadegiani and Claudio E. Kater*
Abstract
Background: The term “adrenal fatigue” (“AF”) has been used by some doctors, healthcare providers, and the
general media to describe an alleged condition caused by chronic exposure to stressful situations. Despite this,
“AF” has not been recognized by any Endocrinology society, who claim there is no hard evidence for the existence.
The aim of this systematic review is to verify whether there is substantiation for “AF”.
Methods: A systematic search was performed at PUBMED, MEDLINE (Ebsco) and Cochrane databases, from the
beginning of the data until April 22nd, 2016. Searched key words were: “adrenal” + “fatigue”, “adrenal” + “burnout”,
“adrenal” + “exhaustion”, “hypoadrenia”, “burnout” + “cortisol”, “fatigue” + “cortisol”, “clinical” + “burnout”, “cortisol” +
“vitalility”, “adrenal” + “vitality”, and “cortisol” + “exhaustion”. Eligibility criteria were: (1) articles written in English, (2)
cortisol profile and fatigue or energy status as the primary outcome, (3) performed tests for evaluating the adrenal
axis, (4) absence of influence of corticosteroid therapy, and (5) absence of confounding diseases. Type of questionnaire
to distinct fatigued subjects, population studied, tests performed of selected studies were analyzed.
Results: From 3,470 articles found, 58 studies fulfilled the criteria: 33 were carried in healthy individuals, and 25 in
symptomatic patients. The most assessed exams were “Direct Awakening Cortisol” (n = 29), “Cortisol Awakening
Response” (n = 27) and “Salivary Cortisol Rhythm” (n = 26).
Discussion: We found an almost systematic finding of conflicting results derived from most of the studies methods
utilized, regardless of the validation and the quality of performed tests. Some limitations of the review include: (1)
heterogeneity of the study design; (2) the descriptive nature of most studies; (3) the poor quality assessment of fatigue;
(4) the use of an unsubstantiated methodology in terms of cortisol assessment (not endorsed by endocrinologists);
(5) false premises leading to an incorrect sequence of research direction; and, (6) inappropriate/invalid conclusions
regarding causality and association between different information.
Conclusion: This systematic review proves that there is no substantiation that “adrenal fatigue” is an actual medical
condition. Therefore, adrenal fatigue is still a myth.

Background
The term “adrenal fatigue” (“AF”) has been used by
some doctors, healthcare providers, and the general
media to describe an alleged condition caused by
chronic exposure to stressful situations. According to
this theory, chronic stress could potentially lead to
“overuse” of the adrenal glands, eventually resulting in
their functional failure. In a recent search on Google
(April 22, 2016), “adrenal fatigue” provided 640,000 re-
sults, and the association of the two words exhibited
1,540,000 findings. Despite this, “adrenal fatigue” has
not been recognized by any endocrinology societies to
date, who claim there is no evidence for the existence
of this syndrome [1].
Conversely, some medical societies, although unrecognized
by American Board of Medical Specialties and Associ-
ation of American Medical Colleges [2, 3], claim that
adrenal fatigue is a real and underdiagnosed disease
[4, 5]. According to these societies, to screen for “AF”
in patients, a questionnaire developed by Dr. Wilson,
who is reportedly the first person to describe this sup-
posed syndrome, is recommended to be used [6]. In
addition, patients suspected of “AF” are now being
tested for serum basal cortisol levels and salivary cor-
tisol rhythm. Those who present impaired results from
these tests are then treated with corticosteroids, re-
gardless of the etiology. As a result, corticosteroids
(mainly hydrocortisone) are probably being prescribed
to a large number of patients, as at least 24,000 health
providers [7] are instructed by one medical society
(The American Academy of Anti-Aging Medicine – A4M)
to prescribe corticosteroids in these cases.
Arguments for corticosteroid use as a treatment for
“claimed AF” include: [1] the immediate and significant
improvement seen in patients who are prescribed cor-
ticosteroid, and [2] the long and extensive clinical symp-
tomatology of this alleged disease, which shows a slow
depletion before clinical and severe hypocortisolism en-
sues [4–6]. Moreover, others claim that endocrinologists
use much too strict diagnostic criteria before prescribing
corticosteroids, and thus, many sufferers would not be
receiving adequate treatment [4, 6]. However, there are
logical counterarguments to routine corticosteroid use
in these patients. First, corticosteroids promote a sense
of wellbeing (usually
temporary),
regardless
of
the
patient’s condition. Second, even at low and physio-
logical doses, corticosteroids increase the risk for several
disorders, such as psychiatric disorders [8–11], osteopor-
osis [12], myopathy [13], glaucoma [14], metabolic disor-
ders [14, 15], sleep disturbances [16] and cardiovascular
diseases [17, 18].
Therefore, is “adrenal fatigue” an actual disorder? Is
fatigue related to depleted adrenal function? Does fa-
tigued healthy subjects present relative adrenal failure?
Is adrenal involved in the pathophysiology of fatigue in
diseases? Which tests were performed in order to es-
tablish markers or triggers? The aim of this systematic
review was to determine the correlation between ad-
renal status and fatigue states, including the recently
described “burnout” or “burnout syndrome”, and other
fatigue-related diseases. The primary objective was to
evaluate the methodology for fatigue status assessment,
including cortisol tests, and to examine the results of
studies involving cortisol and fatigue correlation.
Methods
Search strategies
The PRISMA protocol for systematic reviews was uti-
lized for this study design. A systematic search was
conducted through the electronic PUBMED, MEDLINE
(Ebsco), and COCHRANE databases, from the begin-
ning of the data until April 22, 2016. The search strat-
egy included the following keywords: (1) “adrenal +
fatigue”; (2) “adrenal + burnout”; (3) “adrenal + exhaus-
tion”; (4) “adrenal” + “fatigue”; (5) “hypoadrenia”; (6)
“cortisol” + “fatigue”;
(7)
“cortisol” + “burnout”;
(8)
“clinical” + “burnout”; (9) “cortisol” + “vitality”; (10) “ad-
renal” + “vitality”;
and
(11)
“cortisol” + “exhaustion”,
where “a + b” means “a” and “b” together in the exact
expression, and “a” +”b” means that both words needed
to be contained in the article, but not necessarily to-
gether. Although the terms “adrenal + fatigue” and “ad-
renal” + “fatigue” were searched, as articles found using
the first criteria were also found using the second cri-
teria, further analysis were performed for the exact
expression that matched with the disease. We also
analyzed articles mentioned within identified studies
whenever the alleged disorder, or a similar situation,
were described (such as cortisol profile and exhaustion
or fatigued patients).

 Data extraction
All studies were evaluated by the two reviewers (F.A.C.
and C.E.K.) after removal of duplicate articles, according
to: (1) authorship, (2) journal, (3) publication date, (4)
studied population, (5) definition of “fatigue”, “exhaus-
tion”, and “burnout”, (6) study design and methods, (7)
analysis methods to assess adrenal axis, (8) results, (9)
conclusions, and (10) study variables and bias.
Inclusion and exclusion criteria
Inclusion criteria were: (1) whole article written in English,
(2) cortisol profile and fatigue or energy status as the pri-
mary outcome, (3) specific tests performed for evaluating
the adrenal axis, (4) absence of corticosteroid therapy, (5)
absence of confounding diseases that would lead to an
impaired cortisol status caused by the disorder itself
(such as depression, alcoholism, and morbid obesity).
Studies with a merely description about adrenal axis
impairment with no tests performed were excluded.
Quality assessment
The abstract of each of identified study was analyzed by
one of the authors (F.A.C.), and was excluded if it did not
meet the eligibility criteria. The studies that fulfilled the
inclusion criteria were entirely evaluated regarding the ra-
tionale, method design, primary outcome, assessment of
fatigue, statistical analysis, results, discussion, and conclu-
sions, in order to improve data quality. Those studies that
presented any bias in the methodology, results, or inter-
pretation of the exposed data, which could be reflected in
the analysis of the study as a whole, were also excluded.
Statistical analysis
Each of the studied populations, each of the question-
naires and each of the tests performed were quantified,
whereas tests results were analyzed in terms of percent-
age of type of responses for each of the tests performed.
Results were analyzed in general and according to the
underlying disease.
Results
Study selection
In total, 3,470 articles were identified. A summary of the
study selection is shown in Fig. 1. The search for “ad-
renal” + “burnout” yielded 56 studies; “adrenal” + “ex-
haustion”
yielded
446
articles;
“adrenal” + “fatigue”
yielded 1,353 articles; “fatigue” + “cortisol” yielded 1,128
articles; “cortisol” + “burnout” yielded 102 articles; “corti-
sol” + “vitality” yielded 37 articles; “adrenal” + “vitality”
yielded 53 articles; “hypoadrenia” yielded 9 articles arti-
cles (“hypoadrenocorticism” yielded 1,302 articles but is
used to refer to hypocortisolism in animals, and there-
fore, was not included here); and “cortisol” + “exhaus-
tion” yielded 286 articles. Twelve studies were excluded
because they were written in languages other than
English, 1,989 were excluded because there was no
relation with the purpose of the systematic review,
whereas 905 articles of interest were duplicates. Of
the 564 remaining studies, 504 had only descriptive
characteristics or contained results already presented
in another study (in which tests were performed), and
therefore were excluded. Two studies were excluded
because despite of the correlation between cortisol
profile and burnout or multiple sclerosis, they did not
perform correlation between fatigue and cortisol, but
other aspects, as depression and pain [19, 20]. For the
systematic review, we analyzed all the included and
not excluded studies, which represent a total of 58 ar-
ticles (1.67 % of the original search) (Table 1).

 Study characteristics
Among the 58 studies included, 33 (56.9 % of the selected
studies) were performed in healthy subjects [21–53], since
we considered “burnout” not an actual disorder but in-
stead a stressful condition presented by some groups of
health workers. Despite the several studies describing cor-
tisol impairment in Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS), only
13 (22.4 %) studies performed an actual assessment of
the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis [54–66].
Twelve studies (20.7 %) were found in which tests for cor-
tisol profiling were performed for other diseases [67–77].
However, for analysis purposes, one study [69] was divided
into two studies as it performed two distinct protocols at
different moments. Among these, five were done per-
formed in patients with a diagnosis of breast cancer who
had undergone or were undergoing chemotherapy. One

 study tested patients with fibromyalgia, two studies
compared patients with chronic lower pain, one with
rheumatoid arthritis, one with post brain injury, two
with multiple sclerosis, and one involved patients with
human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and CFS. One
study evaluated both patients with fibromyalgia and pa-
tients with CFS in different groups.
The median number of tested subjects in the 58 studies
was 72 (range: 16–4,299). The median numbers of
participants in articles involving healthy individuals,
patients with CFS, or patients with other diseases
were 76 (16–4,299), 45 (28–185), and 65 (29–1150),
respectively. The largest number of healthy subjects
included groups of workers whose cortisol results
were compared to exhaustion and fatigue status, in an
attempt to discriminate correlations between cortisol
and energy levels. One study involving 4,299 individ-
uals was responsible for more subjects than the sum
of all the other studies.
Methods used to evaluate fatigue in the general study
population
Some authors utilized more than one method to com-
pare the different patients and were included in multiple
groups. A summary of all the methods used to assess fa-
tigue, and their results, is shown in Table 2. Among the
58 studies, 27 (46.6 %) utilized the Cortisol Awakening
Response (CAR) to assess the HPA axis. This method is
based on previous studies [77–81] that indicate cortisol
levels rise by 50 % on average within 30 min of waking
as a physiological response to stay alert, with a blunted
CAR resulting in fatigue symptoms. For the CAR, saliv-
ary cortisol is collected immediately on waking (t = 0)
and again 30 min later (t = 30), and the difference (delta
cortisol) between the two measurements are analyzed.
Among the 27 studies that employed CAR, fourteen
(51.9 %) showed a normal response, nine (23.3 %) had a
diminished delta cortisol, and four (14.8 %) demon-
strated an increased delta cortisol.
Another method that became widely used to evaluate
exhaustion/burnout/fatigue states is the salivary cortisol
rhythm (SCR), which evaluates the change in cortisol
levels between morning, afternoon, and late night. A
total of 26 studies evaluated SCR (44.8 %). Some hetero-
geneity in the method was found between studies, but in
general, salivary cortisol was collected at 8 AM, 4 PM,
and 10–11 PM. While the SCR is considered as another
fatigue marker [82, 83], like the CAR, there is no justifi-
cation for considering this as an etiology for “adrenal fa-
tigue”. Sixteen (61.5 %) studies showed no difference
between fatigued and control patients, whereas seven
(26.9 %) demonstrated an impaired decrease in the circa-
dian SCR. The remaining three (11.6 %) studies dis-
closed a more pronounced decrease in cortisol level.
The direct awakening cortisol (DAC) level, collected at
the exact moment of waking, was used in 29 studies
(50.0 %). Unlike CAR, DAC reflects sleep quality ra-
ther than being a possible identifying factor of fatigue
[84–86], even though a poor quality sleep plays an im-
portant role in the fatigue process [87–89]. In studies
that employed DAC, inconsistent results were ob-
served: normal results were found in nineteen (65.5 %)
studies, elevated levels were shown in four (13.8 %),
and reduced levels in six (20.7 %).
The DAC, CAR and SCR methods were by far the
most commonly elected ones for examining the cor-
relation between cortisol profile and fatigue status.
However, a few other studies analyzed other aspects of
cortisol release.
The dexamethasone (Dex) suppression test (DST) was
also used in nine (15.3 %) studies. The DST identifies
autonomous hypercortisolism, as cortisol production is
normally suppressed by Dex. DSTs have also been used
to investigate hypocortisolism, based on the supposed
assumption that it promotes “oversuppression” of corti-
sol in low cortisol states, indicating that lower levels of
cortisol would disclose a more prolonged suppression
than controls [55, 90–93], although many studies do not
show correlation between DST and fatigue [47, 55, 94, 95].
In six studies, a lower Dex dose (0.5 mg) was used in an
attempt to improve the test sensitivity. Among these, four
studies (66.7 %) showed the same results for both groups,
whereas in two others (33.3 %), the test resulted in lower
and prolonged suppression of cortisol levels in fatigued
subjects. Moreover, an even lower Dex dose (0.25 mg) was
performed in two studies and resulted in reduced cortisol
in one study and normal levels in the group with exhaus-
tion. In one study, Dex dose was not specified, but levels
were not different among exhausted and control groups.
As a whole, the DST was used in nine studies, and no
significant differences were observed between fatigued
and
non-fatigued
groups
in
six
of
these
studies
(66.7 %), whereas reduced levels were observed in
three studies (33.3 %).
Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) is a pituitary
peptide hormone that stimulates cortisol production
by the adrenocortical zona fasciculata. Elevated ACTH
occurs early in primary adrenal insufficiency, whereas
inappropriate (normal) ACTH levels in the presence of
low serum cortisol are found in secondary adrenal fail-
ure. Although, normal ACTH levels with normal corti-
sol levels does not exclude the possibility of relative
adrenocortical failure. Six (10.3 %) studies employed
the morning ACTH levels to compare fatigued and
non-fatigued patients; no significant differences for
ACTH, as well as for cortisol, were found in five stud-
ies (83.3 %), meanwhile one showed elevated ACTH
levels in burnout patients (16.7 %).

 On the other hand, three studies (5.2 %) used the low-
dose cosyntropin (a synthetic 1-24ACTH) stimulation test
(CST), in which 1 μg of cosyntropin is used instead of
the classic 250 μg dose, based on the premise that the
CST is more accurate and sensitive for verifying the
adrenocortical cortisol reserve [96], even though most
findings indicate that both doses have similar accuracy
[97, 98]. Surprisingly, one of three (33.3 %) studies dis-
closed a paradoxically higher cortisol increase compared
to controls, while in two (66.7 %) lower levels were ob-
served. Conversely, impaired cortisol and ACTH re-
sponses was observed in the fatigued group in a single
study in which corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH)
was used to stimulate the HPA axis.
Three (5.2 %) studies measured 24 h-urinary free cor-
tisol (UFC) in an attempt to correlate cortisol excretion
rates with intensity of fatigue. Although the 24 h-UFC
reflects the total cortisol produced per day, it was
initially conceived to investigate cortisol excess syn-
dromes, although diminished levels could hypothetic-
ally imply subnormal adrenal function, despite of lack
of any evidence. One of these studies (33.3 %) found no
correlation between 24
h-UFC and energy status,
whereas two studies (66.7 %) showed reduced values in
fatigued patients.
Thirteen studies (22.4 %) estimated total cortisol re-
lease (AUC) by calculating the areas under the curves
for the whole day salivary cortisol collection by using
three or more daily salivary cortisol levels over four or
more days. Assessment of the total 24 h cortisol release
by this method would complement the SCR, since the
lack of the expected decrease throughout the day ob-
served in some studies can be due either to a non-
elevated morning serum cortisol (MSC) level or to a full
day elevated cortisol, although three daily levels of corti-
sol is probably too few for a minimally precise AUC;

 herein, findings are conflicting. AUC was elevated in two
(15.4 %) studies, normal in eight (61.5 %), and reduced
in another three (23.1 %).
Twenty-two studies (37.9 %) compared baseline MSC
between controls and fatigued patients; traditionally
[98], this is the initial cortisol assessment to investigate
possible hypocortisolism. Basal MSC was not different
between individuals in fourteen (63.6 %) of these studies,
was significantly reduced in fatigued patients in three
(23.1 %), and was elevated in two (15.4 %).
Twenty-two articles (37.9 %) correlated late night sal-
ivary cortisol (11 PM NSC) and fatigue status. The
NSC was initially validated to assess cortisol excess, as
physiologically, one expects lower cortisol levels at the
end of the day; although, NSC has been extended to in-
vestigate hypocortisolism in these studies, despite of
lack of validation. Three studies (13.6 %) showed a
lower cortisol level in fatigued subjects compared to
controls, thirteen (59.1 %) found no differences, and six
(27.3 %) showed increased levels in fatigued subjects.
Six studies (10.3 %) investigated the correlation be-
tween dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S) levels
and fatigue status. Reduced DHEA-S levels are usually
found in hypocortisolism and are a potential marker of
fatigue, although there is still not enough evidence to
corroborate this affirmation. Four studies (66.7 %) found
no correlation with DHEA-S, whereas two (33.3 %)
found lower levels in chronic exhausted patients.
The morning estimated total cortisol release (MAUC)
is obtained by calculating the area under the curves for
the period between the awakening moment and 1 hour
later, and is based on determining three or more salivary
cortisol levels during this period of the day, although
this method has also not been validated by any indexed
study. A total of four studies (6.9 %) among the selected
studies reported the MAUC. Two of these studies
(50.0 %) showed reduced MAUC levels in fatigued sub-
jects, one demonstrated increased results (25.0 %), and
one demonstrated no differences (25.0 %).
Mental stress tests (MST) have been performed in
some studies in order to identify possible differences in
cortisol and ACTH release between fatigued and non-
fatigued individuals. The most employed test was the Trier
Social Stress Test (TSST), which has been already vali-
dated as a stress trigger test [99–102], and requires
complete HPA axis integrity for a proper response. Other
types of MSTs have also been proposed and validated
[103, 104]. MSTs were performed in five different studies
in order to correlate cortisol and ACTH responses and
burnout status. No difference was seen in four studies
(80.0 %), whereas in one (20.0 %), cortisol and ACTH
responses were impaired in exhausted individuals.
Some other tests were performed in a smaller number
of the selected studies, as follows: two studies performed
a 60 min CAR (both showed normal results among fa-
tigued and non-fatigued subjects); one study performed a
15 min CAR (and showed normal results); two studies
performed the ACTH MST (both used the TSST and
found normal results); one study performed the DHEA-S
MST (which also used the TSST and demonstrated normal
results); one study performed the cortisol post Oral Glu-
cose Tolerance Test (OGTT) (and found no differences
among fatigued and non-fatigued subjects); one study cal-
culated cortisol/ACTH ratio (and found an increased ratio
among exhausted subjects); one study evaluated the 4 PM
cortisol level (and found no significant differences between
exhausted subjects and controls); one study used 1.5 mg-
Dex followed by 0.1 mg-CRH to stimulate cortisol and
ACTH (and showed normal responses); one study stimu-
lated ACTH and cortisol with 0.1 mg of CRH (and found
reduced levels of both hormones in fatigued subjects com-
pared to controls); and finally, one study evaluated the
multiple urinary cortisol metabolites and calculated the
Total Cortisol Metabolites (TCM) (and found no differ-
ences between fatigued subjects and controls).
Finally, we were not able to find studies in which the
gold standard test for assessing the integrity and func-
tionality of the HPA axis—the insulin tolerance test
(ITT)—were performed. The same was true for the lipo-
polysaccharides (LPS) stimulation test. Both tests stimu-
late hypothalamic CRH secretion, leading to a complete
evaluation of the HPA axis.
Fatigue in burnout syndrome
Burnout syndrome or clinical burnout, or simply “burn-
out”, refers to a decrease in the cognitive functions, emo-
tional exhaustion, and physical fatigue that is triggered by
stressful situations associated with excessive working
[105]. However, there is no pathognomonic marker for
burnout [105]. For practical purposes, we considered non-
CFS burnout patients as “healthy”, as burnout is yet to be
considered a disease and its characterization is still hetero-
geneous. A summary of the performed methods and their
respective results in non-CFS burnout/healthy patients
[21–53] are shown in Table 3. Assessment of the HPA axis
integrity in burnout patients (at the pituitary and hypo-
thalamic levels) has not been determined.
Fatigue in chronic fatigue syndrome
CFS is a diagnosis used for patients who present severe
fatigue for more than six months, not explained by any
hormonal, metabolic, inflammatory, or other disorders.
Correlations between CFS and the HPA axis have been
studied [54–66] and the results are shown in Table 4.
Fatigue in other disorders
Complaints regarding fatigue not entirely explained by
the underlying pathophysiology of the disease have been
Cadegiani and Kater BMC Endocrine Disorders  (2016) 16:48 
Page 9 of 16
 observed in patients suffering from other disorders,
such as chronic low back pain [106, 107], breast cancer
survivors [108–110], and HIV [111, 112]. Therefore,
the role of the HPA axis in the etiology of fatigue in
these subjects has been analyzed [67–77] and the find-
ings are presented in Table 5.
Questionnaires for fatigue assessment
Among all studies included in this review, nineteen
different types of questionnaires and scores were re-
ported. The most commonly used were: the Maslach
Burnout Inventory (MBI, n = 15), SF-36 (n = 9), the
Chalder

Discussion
Theories on adrenal impairment as the genesis for
fatigue are tempting, as they allow for a treatable condi-
tion. Despite the widespread use of the term “adrenal
fatigue” by the general media and certain health practi-
tioner groups, in this systematic review, only ten cita-
tions [113–122] were found with this exact expression,

 and they were all only descriptive and did not perform
any test regarding the HPA axis and “adrenal fatigue”.
Studies that tried to correlate the HPA axis and fatigue
states used the term “burnout” instead of “adrenal fatigue”
to denote adrenal depletion. Therefore, a distinction
between the “general information” and the actual scien-
tific literature regarding this condition is evident. First,
this suggests that the terminology of a hypothetical
adrenal depletion should be normalized, with a suitable
name given for the purported condition, as “adrenal
fatigue” has been already been stigmatized and lacks
proper scientific support. Second, methodology employed
to evaluate the proposed correlation between fatigue and
adrenal function should be standardized among physicians
and medical associations that claim for the existence of
adrenal impairment in patients with fatigue before evident
clinical hypocortisolism manifests, in order to strength
eventual evidence, in case one finds actual and proper
causal correlation.
No confirmed methods of clinical screening for AF are
available. Indeed, the popular questionnaire developed
by Dr. Wilson and published in the first book exclusively
dedicated to the description of this supposedly disease
[6] has not been cited in any indexed databases. Another
theory, the “Thompson cortisol hypothesis” [123], sug-
gests that cortisol is responsible for yawning and fatigue;
however, again, no studies that tested this theory have
been published in indexed journals. Validated surveys
have been used in studies that investigate fatigue states,
but they were not correlated with proper cortisol assess-
ment methods. The TSST is the only survey to have
enough credibility to be officially tested and standardized
as a trigger of stress [99–102].
Functional tests are the only methods to assess adrenal
cortisol production endorsed by endocrinology societies
[97]. Although, the ITT is considered the gold standard
test to evaluate the entire HPA axis, neither the ITT (or
the similar LPS stimulation test) was performed in any
studies investigating the correlation between fatigue
states and adrenocortical function. Moreover, we gener-
ally found conflicting data using most of the functional
tests when trying to differentiate exhausted, fatigued,
and burnout individuals from healthy patients. For ex-
ample, using the low-dose CST, we found an unexpected
increase in cortisol levels in fatigued subjects in the
selected studies. This may have been perhaps the result
of a relative secondary adrenal insufficiency, which leads
to an amplified adrenal cortisol response due to an up-
regulation of ACTH receptors, but this sounds unjustifi-
able since the lack of continuous stimulation of the
adrenal cortices would cause atrophy, rendering them
non-responsive to a low- (and even high) dose of cosyn-
tropin stimulation in the long run. Regardless of the the-
oretical explanation, CST has shown to be not a good
marker of fatigue. Similarly, ACTH levels were also
poorly studied and did not show significant correlations
in most fatigued subjects. In addition, despite its lack of
standardization, the DST was performed in nine studies,
but conflicting results invalidated attempts to establish
this as a new marker for fatigue states. Moreover, the
24 h-UFC has been shown to be so far inaccurate for
investigation of adrenal impairment. Findings were also
contradictory in the six studies that calculated cortisol
AUC as well as in the four studies that performed
MAUC. Therefore, the above methods cannot be used to
differentiate fatigued from non-fatigued individuals.
In this review, we also examined whether cortisol
markers can be used to assess cortisol impairment. The
results of our review indicate that the three major tests
(CAR, DAC and SCR) used to identify the underlying
causes of the fatigue/exhaustion state failed to do so, since
they were unable to demonstrate significant differences or
proper causality. CAR and DAC frequently showed incon-
sistent results in studies that used heterogeneous groups
of subjects. CAR and DAC are not necessarily indicatives
of the etiology and pathogenesis of the fatigue status, since
both can be consequences of other disorders, such as
sleep disturbances. Indeed, a recent study [124] was the
first to use CAR as a marker of improvement of burnout
syndrome, which reinforces the use of this method for
monitoring the consequences of fatigue states, but not for
its etiology [77–81].
With regards to the SCR, the results may be misleading
if they are not analyzed together with the total 24 h corti-
sol release. This is because a non-physiological blunted
rhythm can be due either to an impairment of the lower-
ing cortisol trend throughout the day or due to a lower
morning cortisol level. Despite this, studies that evaluated
total 24 h cortisol by measuring serial salivary cortisol
levels also showed conflicting findings. Our systematic
review corroborates another systematic review [83] that
shows inconsistency regarding measuring methods among
across different randomized controlled trials. Similarly,
baseline MSC and NSC were poor markers of fatigue sta-
tus as it failed to reveal any differences in burnout/exhaus-
tion/fatigue patients compared to healthy subjects.
Adrenal size could be considered another marker of
adrenal activity, as hypertrophic/hyperplastic adrenal
glands could be the result of an ACTH over-stimulation
by the pituitary, as seen in subjects exposed to chronic
stress [125, 126], whereas a diminished or atrophic gland
may reflect adrenal insufficiency at any level of the HPA
axis [98]. However, not a single study could be identified
in which the adrenal size has been checked in fatigued
or exhausted patients. Similarly, although DHEA-S
could also be a potential marker for adrenal atrophy or
dysfunction, is still uncertain whether it plays any
pathophysiological role in fatigue. Finally, none of the

Page 12 of 16
 abovementioned methods were accurate markers of fa-
tigue, nor could they be correlated with the HPA axis
dysfunction as an etiology of fatigue.
It is also important to note that once adrenal impair-
ment is confirmed using any of these tests, the etiology
should also be elucidated. As the HPA axis can be
affected by several chronic and/or metabolic disorders,
other primary conditions must be excluded before
intrinsic disorders of the HPA axis are deemed respon-
sible. Typical differential diagnosis of “adrenal fatigue”
and related states are: (1) sleep obstructive apnea syn-
drome; (2) adrenal insufficiency; (3) mental illnesses; (4)
excessive working (overwork); (5) night-shift workers; (6)
other hormonal deficiencies; (7) liver and kidney dys-
functions; (8) heart conditions; (9) chronic pulmonary
obstructive disease; (10) autoimmune diseases.
Although conflicting data were reported, patients with
CFS tend to have a normal cortisol profile, and the ab-
normalities found can be typically be explained by a
poor quality sleeping patterns. Therefore, health pro-
viders should not be concerned about adrenal function
in CFS subjects once they had been already excluded to
other conditions prior to the diagnosis of CFS. Similarly,
studies investigating patients with the burnout syndrome
were greatly inconsistent So far, HPA axis tests should
not be used as markers for burnout syndrome by health
practitioners. Similar conclusions can be drawn for the
use of HPA axis tests as markers for fibromyalgia and
other chronic diseases, which tend to demonstrate in-
consistent findings, whereas studies that were performed
in breast cancer subjects tended to show depletion of
cortisol levels; however, studies in breast cancer were
performed while administering chemotherapy, which
can introduce a confounding bias.
Therefore, based on our current knowledge, cortisol
tests should not yet be used in clinical practice for
examining any condition, except if adrenal impairment
is suspected. Moreover, glucocorticoid therapy should be
avoided in patients, as it can increase the risk of cardio-
vascular disease or osteoporosis, even in low doses.
Limitations
Some limitations of this review include: (1) our inability
to perform a meta-analysis due to heterogeneity of the
study design; (2) the descriptive nature of most studies,
and the reporting of a condition that has not been scientif-
ically proven without adding new data nor providing solid
arguments; (3) the fact that most studies were published
in low impact journals; (4) the inadequate and poor qual-
ity assessment of fatigue; (5) the use of an unsubstantiated
methodology in terms of cortisol assessment; (6) the lack
of concern regarding validated adrenal assessment (as en-
dorsed by endocrinologists); (7) false premises leading to
an incorrect sequence of thinking and research direction;
and, (8) inappropriate/invalid conclusions regarding caus-
ality and association between different information, in
particular, whether any abnormalities would be a
marker or a potential target for treatment.
Final discussions
Our results corroborate an Endocrine Society warning
statement regarding adrenal fatigue (1), as saying that
“adrenal fatigue is not a real medical condition”. While a
recent systematic review on burnout was published
(109) that implicated some HPA dysfunctions as markers
or triggers of burnout, there were important bias selection
regarding the articles chosen. Therefore, we recommend
that for further prospective studies aiming to correlate fa-
tigue, exhaustion, or burnout status with impairment of the
HPA axis, an ITT or a 250 μg CST should be performed to
evaluate the adrenocortical ability to release cortisol,
measurements of ACTH, DHEA-S, and corticosterone (an
intermediate steroid product that is impaired earlier than
cortisol [127]), the adoption of the most validated question-
naires, particularly Maslach Burnout Inventory, the Chalder
Fatigue Scale, SF-36 or the General Fatigue Scale of the
Multidimensional Fatigue Inventor, and considering differ-
ent study populations, including: (a) healthy subjects; (b)
burnout healthy subjects; (c) subjects with overtraining
syndrome; (d) subjects post-chemotherapy; (e) subjects
with CFS; and (f) subjects with fibromyalgia.
In addition, we do not recommend the use of the
many methods reported in the articles evaluated in this
systematic review, as they are not accurate to determine
whether a patient has or has not adrenal failure.
The answer to whether “adrenal fatigue” or depletion
exists or not may not be simple, but different answers
can be offered according to the presence of an under-
lying disease. However, so far, there is no substantiation
to show its existence.
Conclusion
To our knowledge, this is the first systematic review
made by endocrinologists to examine a possible correl-
ation between the HPA axis and a purported “adrenal
fatigue” and other conditions associated with fatigue,
exhaustion or burnout. So far, there is no proof or dem-
onstration of the existence of “AF”. While a significant
number of the reported studies showed differences
between the healthy and fatigued groups, important
methodological issues and confounding factors were
apparent. Two concluding remarks emerge from this
systematic review: (1) the results of previous studies
were contradictory using all the methods for assessing
fatigue and the HPA axis, and (2) the most appropriate
methods to assess the HPA axis were not used to evaluate
fatigue. Therefore, “AF” requires further investigation
by those who claim for its existence.
