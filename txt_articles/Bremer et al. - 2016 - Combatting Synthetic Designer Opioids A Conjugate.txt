Abstract
Fentanyl is an addictive prescription opioid that is over 80 times more potent than morphine. The 
synthetic nature of fentanyl has enabled the creation of dangerous ‘designer drug’ analogues that 
escape toxicology screening, yet display comparable potency to the parent drug. Alarmingly, a 
large number of fatalities have been linked to overdose of fentanyl derivatives. Herein, we report 
an effective immunotherapy for reducing the psychoactive effects of fentanyl class drugs. A single 
conjugate vaccine was created that elicited high levels of antibodies with cross-reactivity for a 
wide panel of fentanyl analogues. Moreover, vaccinated mice gained significant protection from 
lethal fentanyl doses. Lastly, a surface plasmon resonance (SPR)-based technique was established 
enabling drug specificity profiling of antibodies derived directly from serum. Our newly developed 
fentanyl vaccine and analytical methods may assist in the battle against synthetic opioid abuse. 
Fentanyl is an effective synthetic opioid that is used legally as a schedule II prescription pain 
reliever. However, fentanyl presents a significant abuse liability due to the euphoric feeling it 
induces via activation of μ-opioid receptors (MOR) in the brain; the same pharmacological target 
as the illegal schedule I opioid, heroin.[1] Excessive activation of MOR results in respiratory 
depression which can be fatal.[2] Fentanyl exceeds the potency of heroin by >10-fold, and 
morphine by >80-fold posing a significant risk of overdose when it is consumed from unregulated 
sources.[3] Furthermore, the ease of fentanyl synthesis enables illegal production and the creation 
of designer drug analogues.[4] The fact that the pharmacology of these analogues has yet to be 
properly characterized makes them particularly dangerous, especially when certain modifications, 
even methyl additions, can increase potency, notably at the 3-position (Figure 1).[5]

Last July, the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) reported an alarming surge in 
fentanyl overdose deaths:[6] the latest update in a long stream of overdose cases starting 
with α-methylfentanyl aka “China White” in the late 1980s.[7] A newer designer analogue, 
acetylfentanyl, further exacerbates the opioid epidemic because of its deceptive sale as 
heroin or as a heroin mixture,[8] and it has been linked to a number of overdose deaths.[9]

 In addition to the US, fentanyl abuse is on the rise across Europe; while the most overdose 
deaths occurred in Estonia, the highest consumption of fentanyl per capita was reported in 
Germany and Austria.[10]
To combat the harmful and addictive effects of fentanyl and its analogues, we pursued an 
immunopharmacotherapeutic approach, similar to previous campaigns for addiction 
therapeutics against cocaine,[11] nicotine,[12] methamphetamine[13] and heroin.[14] The 
basis of this strategy involves active vaccination of a protein-drug conjugate to generate an 
in vivo ‘immunoantagonist’, which effectively minimizes concentrations of the target drug at 
the sites of action. As a result, the vaccine reduces the addiction liability and overdose 
potential of the specific drug. In this work, we report the first instance of an efficacious 
fentanyl conjugate vaccine. Upon immunization, this vaccine successfully stimulated 
endogenous generation of IgG antibodies with specificity for fentanyl class drugs. Moreover, 
mouse antiserum showed nanomolar affinity for a variety of fentanyl analogues by SPR-
analytical methods. When mice were dosed with potentially lethal quantities of fentanyl 
analogues, the vaccine imparted significant protection. No other vaccines to date have 
demonstrated blockade of the acutely lethal effects of any drugs of abuse. Importantly, our 
research efforts have yielded significant progress for mitigating the pharmacodynamic 
effects of fentanyl class drugs. In developing a fentanyl vaccine, hapten design presented the 
initial and possibly the most crucial challenge. As we have reported previously, small 
molecule haptens must faithfully preserve the natural structure of the target molecule to 
make a successful immunoconjugate.[15] Confronted not only with fentanyl, but also 
designer analogues, our hapten incorporated the core N-(1-phenethylpiperidin-4-yl)-N-
phenylacetamide scaffold to achieve broad immune specificity for virtually all fentanyl 
derivatives. With this mindset, the propanoyl group in fentanyl was selected as the point of 
linker attachment because it would not sterically encumber the core structure (Figure 1). 
Ultimately, hapten design was accomplished by replacing the propanoyl group in fentanyl 
with a glutaric acid moiety. The added carboxyl group enabled N-hydroxysuccinimide 
(NHS) ester formation for bioconjugation of the hapten[16] to an immunogenic carrier 
protein (Figure 1). This reliable amide coupling reaction is a standard method for generating 
hapten-protein conjugates,[12c, 17] facilitating high loading of fentanyl onto bovine serum 
albumin (BSA) and tetanus toxoid (TT) proteins through surface lysine residues; 38 and 40 
copies were obtained, respectively, as assessed by MALDI-TOF spectra (Figure S1a/b). Of 
the two conjugates, the fentanyl-TT conjugate (Fent-TT, Figure 1) was chosen for 
immunization because TT is a component of clinically-approved tetanus and glycoconjugate 
vaccines. For vaccine formulation, Fent-TT was combined with adjuvants Al(OH)3 (alum) 
and CpG oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN) 1826 which have proven effective in boosting IgG 
antibody responses to a heroin conjugate vaccine.[14a] When mice were immunized with 
the Fent-TT vaccine, it induced very high anti-fentanyl antibody midpoint titers by ELISA 
of >100,000 (Figure 2), providing ample in vivo neutralization capacity for a variety of 
fentanyls (Figure 1).
To assess vaccine performance, we employed antinociception assays that are a standard 
method for measuring the analgesic potential of opioid drugs in rodent models;[14a, 18] 
opioids such as fentanyl increase pain thresholds in a dose-responsive manner, and these 
thresholds can be quantified by measuring animal latency to nociception induced by a hot

 surface. A drug vaccine will blunt the pharmacological action of the target drug via serum 
antibody-mediated immunoantagonism of an administered dose; therefore, a successful 
vaccine should shift the drug dose-response curve in antinociception assays to the ‘right’. 
Comparison of drug ED50 doses in vaccinated and non-vaccinated mice serves as a useful 
metric for drug vaccine efficacy. Previously, we have reported vaccine-induced shifts of 
about 5 to 10-fold which caused heroin-dependent rats to extinguish drug self-
administration.[14a, 14b] In the current study, we observed large fentanyl ED50 shifts of 
over 30-fold. Remarkably, during the initial week 6 testing session, fentanyl dosing was 
incapable of overriding the protective capacity of the vaccine (Figure S2). One month later 
(week 10), anti-drug titers in vaccinated mice had decreased to a point where smaller 
fentanyl doses could be used to generate full dose-response curves for ED50 determination; 
large vaccine-mediated shifts were observed (33-fold in the tail immersion test, Figure 3). 
Strikingly, at the two largest doses that were safely administered to vaccinated mice (2.2 and 
4.4 mg/kg), untreated mice experienced a 18 and 55% fatality rate respectively, thus 
demonstrating the ability of the vaccine to block lethal fentanyl doses.
As a testament to the vaccine’s ability to neutralize other fentanyl analogues, Fent-TT 
immunized mice showed protection from two of the most common illegal fentanyl 
derivatives, 3-methylfentanyl and α-methylfentanyl aka “China White” (see Figure 1 for 
structures). The α-Me analogue was equipotent with the parent compound, and the vaccine 
was able to shift the α-Me ED50 by about 8-fold (Figure 3). On the other hand, the 3-Me 
analogue was extraordinarily potent (about 10-fold greater than fentanyl), yet the vaccine 
still produced a 4-fold ED50 shift (Figure 3). Overall, our behavioral results indicate that the 
Fent-TT vaccine provided ample attenuation of large fentanyl doses in vivo while 
demonstrating a therapeutically useful level of cross-reactivity to fentanyl analogues. 
Clinically, these results implicate Fent-TT as an effective addiction therapy for curbing 
fentanyl abuse and overdose-induced lethality.
From a pharmacokinetic standpoint, we investigated the effect of the Fent-TT vaccine on the 
biodistribution of a fentanyl dose. Following administration of a fentanyl dose, we sacrificed 
both control and vaccinated mice at roughly the tmax (time at peak drug plasma 
concentrations) and measured fentanyl concentrations in both brain and blood samples by 
LCMS. Our results clearly show how serum antibodies in vaccinated mice act as a depot to 
bind 45-times the amount of fentanyl relative to serum proteins in control mice. This 
translated to a significant reduction in fentanyl brain concentrations of vaccinated mice, 
lending to a pharmacological explanation of how the vaccine attenuates fentanyl 
psychoactivity.
Behavioral and pharmacokinetic results were corroborated with thorough biochemical 
analysis of antiserum derived from Fent-TT vaccinated mice. To achieve this, we employed 
surface plasmon resonance (SPR) spectroscopy, a highly sensitive technique for 
investigating protein-protein or protein-small molecule binding interactions.[19] In a new 
application of SPR, we measured binding affinities of polyclonal antibodies in vaccinated 
mouse serum for various fentanyl analogues. Diluted mouse serum was preincubated with a 
series of concentrations of selected fentanyl derivatives and then injected into a Biacore 
3000 containing a Fent-BSA coated chip. Essentially, this method is a more sophisticated

 version of competitive ELISA in which serially-diluted free drug competes with an 
immobilized drug hapten for antibody binding.[20] Our results from the SPR competition 
experiment (Figure 5a) indicated that antibodies from Fent-TT immunized mice have high 
affinity for fentanyl derivatives, generating binding curves with low nanomolar IC50 values 
and limits of detection in the pM range (see Figure 5a and raw sensorgrams, Figure S3). 
Relative affinities between analogues with different R1 alkyl groups were very similar, likely 
due to the fact that the R1 position was used as a linker attachment point. As expected, 
methylation at other positions resulted in lower affinity but still IC50 values were <100 nM. 
Furthermore, the SPR IC50s mirrored the results in behavioral assays, and in both cases 
followed a trend of Fent>α-Me>cis-3-Me. Since the Fent-TT vaccine gave broad specificity 
to fentanyl class drugs, two clinically used opioids methadone (MeD) and oxycodone (Oxy) 
were tested to ensure minimal cross reactivity. Indeed, affinities for these opioids were 
>7,500 times lower compared to fentanyl (Figure 5a), demonstrating that they could still be 
used in Fent-TT vaccinated subjects.
Further validation of the SPR method was pursued to confirm that the generated IC50 values 
were representative of actual KD; hapten affinity does not always reflect free drug affinity. 
To address this problem, we affinity purified anti-fentanyl antibodies and loaded them onto 
an SPR chip for direct measurement of free fentanyl binding kinetics. As shown in Figure 5b 
sensorgrams, the fentanyl KD of purified antibodies (2 nM), is in close agreement with the 
IC50 value determined by the competition method (5 nM). Thus, we have demonstrated the 
SPR competition method as an accurate way to measure drug affinities of polyclonal serum 
antibodies. A crucial aspect of immunopharmacotherapy is proper characterization of anti-
drug antibodies, and the SPR method could help to facilitate this facet of drug vaccine 
development. Additionally, the method could be used to screen biological samples e.g. blood 
or urine for the presence of a wide variety of fentanyl derivatives, especially since the limit 
of detection for many fentanyl analogues is <1 nM (Figure 5a, Figure S3).
The current study has yielded a potential therapeutic that could assist in combatting the rise 
of opioid abuse. An effective fentanyl conjugate vaccine was developed that easily ablates 
small doses needed to achieve a normal drug-induced ‘high’ but also attenuates large, 
potentially lethal doses of fentanyl class drugs. Furthermore, the success of this vaccine’s 
design helps to advance immunopharmacotherapy from an academic novelty towards a 
practical therapy, and influences the creation of vaccines against other designer drugs.[4, 21]
