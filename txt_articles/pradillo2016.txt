Abstract 
Neuroprotective strategies for ischemic stroke have failed to translate from bench to 
bedside, possibly due to the lack of consideration of key clinical co-morbidities. Stroke 
and co-morbidities are associated with raised levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokine 
interleukin-1 (IL-1). Inhibition of IL-1 by the administration of interleukin-1 receptor 
antagonist (IL-1Ra) has shown to be neuroprotective after experimental cerebral 
ischemia. Stroke can also trigger a robust neuroreparative response following injury, yet 
many of these new born neurons fail to survive or integrate into pre-existing circuits. 
Thus, we explore here effects of IL-1Ra on post-stroke neurogenesis in young and 
aged/co-morbid rats. Aged lean, aged Corpulent (a model of atherosclerosis, obesity and 
insulin resistance) and young Wistar male rats were exposed to transient cerebral 
ischemia, received subcutaneous IL-1Ra 3 and 6h during reperfusion, and effects on 
stroke outcome and neurogenesis were analyzed. Our results show that administration 
of IL-1Ra improves stroke outcome in both young and aged/co-morbid rats. 
Furthermore, IL-1Ra not only increases stem cell proliferation, but also significantly 
enhances neuroblast migration and the number of newly born neurons after cerebral 
ischemia. Overall, our data demonstrate that systemic administration of IL-1Ra 
improves outcome and promotes neurogenesis after experimental stroke, further 
highlighting the therapeutic potential of this clinically approved drug. 
Highlights 
- IL-1β is a key proinflammatory cytokine involved in ischemic brain damage. 
- Administration of IL-1Ra improves the stroke outcome in young and co-morbid rats. 
- Acute IL-1Ra administration also promotes neurogenesis after experimental stroke.

1. Introduction 
Cerebral ischemia is the second leading cause of death and disability worldwide with 
treatment limited to fibrinolysis and intravascular therapy, both applicable in a low 
percentage of patients. Other strategies to improve outcome after stroke have failed to 
translate from the preclinical setting to the clinic, and with these failures have come 
calls for more rigorous and transparent approaches to experimental design and conduct1, 
2. Highlighted in many of these calls is the need to consider age and co-morbidities 
experimentally, as these involve a strong inflammatory response, and are associated 
with increased risk of stroke and poor post-stroke outcomes. 
The pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-1 (IL-1) is a major driver of inflammation, 
with well documented detrimental effects in multiple preclinical models of systemic 
inflammatory disease as well as in cerebral ischemia3-5. To this end, the selective, 
naturally occurring competitive inhibitor of IL-1, interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-
1Ra) has shown potential as a new treatment for stroke6-8. More specifically, in a 
number of experimental stroke paradigms IL-1Ra reduces infarct volume and improves 
long term functional outcome, including in co-morbid animals5, 9-11. However, exact 
mechanisms by which IL-1Ra is neuroprotective are yet to be fully established. 
While much research has focused on limiting ischemic damage in the initial stages of 
acute reperfusion, it is also important to understand mechanisms that underpin brain 
repair following injury and develop strategies that enhance reparative endogenous 
processes, including adult neurogenesis. Ischemic injury elicits a robust neurogenic 
response12 by stimulating production of neuronal progenitor cells (NPCs) in distinct 
neurogenic regions, which include the subventricular zone (SVZ) and the subgranular 
zone (SGZ), to generate new functional neurons. Though mechanisms underlying post-
   
5 
 
stroke neurogenesis and the influence of inflammation on these processes are still 
poorly understood, it has been observed in young and aged animals that inflammation 
impairs both basal levels of neurogenesis and attenuates the neurogenic response 
triggered by CNS injury via induction of the pro-inflammatory cytokines13-16. IL-1, for 
example, reduces the proliferation and differentiation of NPCs to neurons in pathologies 
such as stress and depression, effects reversed by administration of IL-1Ra17, 18. 
Here, we explored how inhibition of IL-1 actions by clinically relevant, delayed 
administration of subcutaneous IL-1Ra affects stroke outcome and neurogenesis up to 
28 days after experimental ischemia, in aged/co-morbid and young rats.  
2. Materials and methods 
2.1. Animals  
All experiments were performed using 13-month-old male, lean (JCR:LA-lean (cp/); 
400–500 g) and Corpulent (Cp) (JCR:LA-cp (cp/cp); 900–1000g) rats (University of 
Alberta, Edmonton, Canada) and 2-month-old Wistar rats (200-250 g; Charles River, 
Wilmington, MA, USA). Cp rats are homozygous for the autosomal recessive cp gene 
(cp/cp), and spontaneously develop obesity, hyperlipidemia, insulin resistance, 
glomerular sclerosis, and atherosclerosis with enhanced vascular contractility and 
reduced vascular relaxation19. Animals were allowed free access to food and water and 
were maintained under temperature, humidity, and light-controlled conditions. All 
procedures were performed under appropriate United Kingdom Home Office licenses 
and adhered to the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act (1986)20.  
2.2. Treatment 
Animals were randomized for all experiments and assessments were performed in a 
blinded manner. Lean, Cp and young Wistar rats received two doses (subcutaneous) of 
   
6 
 
placebo or IL-1Ra (25 mg/kg, 12.5 mg/kg and 50 mg/kg respectively) at 3 and 6h post 
reperfusion and were allocated randomly to the following experimental groups 
sacrificed on post-stroke day 7: aged lean+tMCAO+placebo (n=10); aged 
lean+tMCAO+IL-1Ra (n=10); aged Cp+tMCAO+placebo (n=9); aged Cp+tMCAO+IL-
1Ra (n=9); young Wistar+tMCAo+placebo (n=8) and young Wistar+tMCAo+IL-1Ra 
(n=8). Another two groups of young Wistar were sacrificed at 14d after stroke:  young 
Wistar+tMCAo+placebo-14d (n=8) and young Wistar+tMCAo+IL-1Ra-14d (n=8) to 
determine 
neuroblast 
migration, 
and 
two 
groups 
at 
28d: 
young 
Wistar+tMCAo+placebo-28d (n=8) and young Wistar+tMCAo+IL-1Ra-28d (n=8) to 
analyze the number of new integrated neurons. Group sizes were determined by power 
calculation (α=0.05, β=0.2).  
The pharmacokinetic profile of subcutaneous human IL-1Ra (r-met-huIL-1Ra: Kineret; 
Amgen, Thousand Oaks, CA, USA) or placebo (Amgen, Thousand Oaks, CA, USA) 
was assessed in young and aged-comorbid rats as previously described21. Owing to the 
highly lipophobic formulation of the drugs, obese Cp rats received half the dose of IL-
1Ra (50%) per body weight compared with aged lean rats22. Plasma levels of IL-1Ra 
(measured by ELISA) in Lean/Cp rats reached a concentration of ~8000 ng/ml 8h after 
both injections. Young Wistar rats were given double the dose of the aged lean animals 
due to the faster metabolism of young animals23. Following studies by Greenhalgh et al. 
(2010), a single administration of 100mg/kg of IL-1Ra to young rats at the time of the 
MCAO, resulted in a plasma concentration of ~9000 ng/ml 8h after its administration. 
Therefore the administration regime of IL-1Ra used here resulted in comparable plasma 
levels of drug, at what we believe to be clinically therapeutic concentrations24.

2.3. Focal cerebral ischemia 
Focal cerebral ischemia was induced in aged lean and Cp rats by 90 min transient 
occlusion of the left middle cerebral artery (tMCAO) as described previously22. Focal 
cerebral ischemia was induced in young Wistar rats by 70 min transient occlusion of the 
left middle cerebral artery and left common carotid artery (CCA). The slight difference 
in surgical protocol was due to a resistance of young rats to infarction when only the 
MCA was occluded (data not shown). It was necessary to occlude both the MCA and 
CCA in these young healthy animals to achieve similar infarcts to aged lean/corpulent 
rats infarcts to analyze the IL-1Ra effect on neurogenesis, due to the influence of infarct 
size in the neurogenic response after stroke25. Isoflurane (2% for induction and 
1.5% during surgery) was used in a mixture of 70% N2O and 30% O2. Core body 
temperature was maintained at 37.0°C±0.5°C throughout the surgery by a heating 
blanket (Homeothermic Blanket Control Unit; Harvard Apparatus, Kent, UK). Ischemia 
was induced by a transient ligature of the left MCA trunk and/or CCA with a 10-0 
suture (Prolene, Ethicon, Somerville, NJ, USA). Occlusion and reperfusion were 
confirmed visually under the surgical microscope. After surgery, animals were returned 
to home cages and allowed free access to water and food. Animals were excluded from 
statistical analysis based on an a priori exclusion criterion, namely if animals 
experienced brain hemorrhage, lack of reperfusion or if the surgery took longer than 
45min and there was excessive bleeding (2 aged leans were excluded in total). Only one 
animal died during the duration of the study due to anesthetic overdose.  
 
2.4. Measurement of infarct volume and BBB damage 
Lesion volume and edema were assessed on T2W brain images obtained at 24h and 7d 
after stroke, using a 7-T, horizontal-bore magnet (Agilent Technologies, UK) interfaced 
   
8 
 
to a Bruker Avance III console (Bruker Biospin, UK) using a surface transmit-receive 
coil. Images were analyzed using Anatomist software (http://brainvisa.info). In the 
group of young Wistar rats sacrificed at 28d, the loss of cortex was determined in brain 
sections by Nissl staining as described previously10.  
Blood–brain barrier (BBB) damage was determined by immunohistochemical staining 
of endogenous rat immunoglobin G (IgG) as described previously21 in all the 
experimental groups at 7d, and in young Wistar rats at 14d of reperfusion.  
2.5. Stroke outcome 
Neurological status was assessed blinded to drug treatment, before and at different time 
points up to 28d after stroke, and by the use of motor, behavioral and cylinder tests26-28. 
For the motor and behavioral scales, each test was conducted three times per trial and 
the average taken to determine outcome. For the cylinder test, each animal was allowed 
to freely explore the arena for up to 4 min. All rears were scored by the use of the right 
paw, left paw, or both paws during rearing29. The different forelimb preference, for 
placements made, was calculated as a percentage of the total number of placements 
made.  
2.6. Incorporation of Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) 
To examine the number of new integrated neurons in young Wistar rats at 28 days after 
experimental 
stroke, 
animals 
were 
injected 
intraperitoneally 
with 
50mg/kg 
bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU; Sigma; UK) twice a day on days 4, 5 and 6 post-ischemia.  
2.7. Tissue processing 
Rats were transcardially perfused with 0.9% saline followed by 4% paraformaldehyde 
(pH=7.4). Brains were removed, post fixed, cryoprotected in 30% sucrose and frozen at 
   
9 
 
−20°C. Sections (30µm) were cut on a sledge microtome (Bright series 8000; Bright 
Instruments, Huntingdon, UK) and stored at −20°C in antifreeze solution (30% ethylene 
glycol and 20% glycerol in phosphate-buffered saline) until processing.  
2.8. Immunofluorescence 
With this technique we evaluated different markers of neurogenesis. We first analyzed 
NPCs proliferation in the SVZ by staining for Ki67, a nuclear protein associated with 
cellular proliferation which is expressed in all phases of the cell cycle, except the resting 
phase30. To determine the differentiation of NPCs into neuroblasts, we stained for 
Doublecortin (DCX), a microtubule associated phosphoprotein which is a neuroblast 
marker31. Finally, we studied the number of mature differentiated and integrated 
neurons (NeuN+/BrdU+/cFos+ cells) as described previously32, with slight modifications. 
For these purposes free-floating sections (30µm thick) were washed in PBS and 
incubated for 120min in blocking solution (PBS, 0.5% Triton X-100 and containing 5% 
donkey serum, Serotec, UK) and then incubated overnight at 4ºC in blocking solution 
with the following primary antibodies (Ab): rabbit anti Ki-67 (Abcam, UK); goat anti 
Doublecortin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, USA); mouse anti NeuN (Millipore, UK) and 
rabbit anti c-Fos (Abcam, UK). Antigens were visualized by using the following 
fluorochrome-conjugated secondary Abs: donkey-anti rabbit, anti-goat or anti-mouse 
Alexa Fluor 488 to detect Ki-67, DCX or NeuN, respectively, and donkey-anti rabbit 
Alexa Fluor 647 to detect c-Fos (Invitrogen, UK). Sections used to detect NeuN and c-
Fos were then fixed for 15min in 4% paraformaldheyde solution, washed with PBS and 
then the BrdU detection was started. Sections were first incubated in HCl 2N at 37ºC for 
30min in order to denature the DNA chain and, after washing in PBS, were incubated in 
blocking solution as described above. BrdU antigen was visualized by using a sheep-
anti-BrdU Ab (Abcam, UK) and an anti-sheep Cy3 as secondary Ab (Millipore, UK).  
   
10 
 
Finally, all sections were washed with PBS and mounted onto slides and cover slipped 
with Prolong anti-fade medium (Life Sciences, Paisley, UK). Controls performed in 
parallel without primary antibodies showed very low levels of nonspecific staining. 
2.9. Optical density and cell quantification on confocal images 
All images were acquired in a blinded manner by laser-scanning confocal microscopy 
(LSM710; Zeiss, Munich, Germany). To analyze the proliferation of NPCs labeled by 
Ki67, four images from five consecutive sections were captured to cover the total 
extension of the SVZ per animal, starting at 1.70mm from bregma until -0.40mm 
(Supp.Fig.4A; regions A to D). The distance between image A and B was 200µm; 
distance between B-C and C-D was 400µm, and z-stacks of each image were obtained 
at 20x.  
To study the effect of IL-1Ra on neuroblasts migration (DCX+ cells) we follow the 
protocol described previously by Moraga et al., in 2014, where the migration of these 
cells was studied in mice after stroke25. Then, immunofluorescence z-stack images were 
obtained at 20x from five correlative sections of each brain. We established three 
different zones to analyze the neuroblast migration, starting at the SVZ (zone 1) and two 
adjacent zones (Zone 2 and Zone 3) along the Corpus Callosum (Fig. 5A). The analysis 
of both, the effect of IL-1Ra on Ki67 immunostaining and DCX+ cells migration images 
were performed by integrated density calculations using Volocity 3D image analysis 
software (Perkin-Elmer, USA). 
For the analysis of the number of new integrated neurons (BrdU+/NeuN+/c-Fos+ cells), 
immunofluorescence images were taken from 4 consecutive sections beginning at 1.60 
mm from bregma until 0.20 mm. The images were taken at 40x, spaced 800µm from 
each other to cover the entire top of the cortex below the stroke, using as boundaries the 
corpus callosum and the end of the cortex (see Fig.6A and Supp. Fig.4B). A total of 30 
   
11 
 
images/ipsilateral- hemisphere/section were obtained, and the quantification of the new 
neurons was made using ZEN 2009 software (Zeiss). All colocalization images shown 
were confirmed by orthogonal projection of the z-stack files. 
2.10. Statistical analysis 
Group sizes (n=6-10) were calculated based on previous data. Data are presented as 
mean±standard deviation (SD). For parametric data, Student’s t-test and two-way 
ANOVA followed by Bonferroni´s correction were used for single and multiple 
comparisons respectively. For non-parametric data, Mann-Whitney U test followed by 
Bonferroni´s correction was performed. Non-parametric data are presented as median 
distribution (interquartile range). Linear association between 2 variables was determined 
by the Pearson correlation coefficient. 
3. Results 
3.1. IL-1Ra improves long-term stroke outcome  
Delayed IL-1Ra administration at 3 and 6h reperfusion in aged lean, aged Cp and young 
Wistar rats induced a significant reduction in infarct volume at 24h and 7d of 
reperfusion, and a significant reduction in cortex loss at 28d in young Wistar rats. 
Reductions in infarct volume at 24h of reperfusion were 37%, 42% and 40% in aged 
lean, aged Cp and young Wistar rats respectively as measured by T2W MRI (Fig.1A, 
B). A reduction in ischemic damage in IL-1Ra treated animals was also seen at 7d 
reperfusion in aged lean, aged Cp and young rats (24%, 46% and 37% of reduction 
respectively), although only reached significance in aged Cp and young Wistar rats 
(Fig.1C). A reduction in cortex loss of 56% was also observed by Nissl staining in the 
IL-1Ra treated young Wistar group at 28d reperfusion compared to the corresponding 
placebo treated group (Fig.1D). Edema was also measured and corrected for at 24h and 
   
12 
 
7d reperfusion in all the animals following ischemic insult and there was no difference 
between placebo and IL-1Ra in any experimental group (data not shown).  
IgG staining at 7d reperfusion revealed a reduction of 40%, 48% and 46% in BBB 
damage in IL-1Ra treated aged lean, aged Cp and young Wistar animals respectively, 
versus their placebo-treated counterparts (Fig.2A, B, C). A reduction of 26% was also 
observed at 14d reperfusion in young Wistar rats treated with IL-1Ra versus their 
placebo counterparts (Supp. Fig.1). 
To assess the impact of delayed IL-1Ra on long term outcome, motor function and 
behavior were assessed by different scales and by the cylinder test, before and at 24h 
and 7d following reperfusion in all animals, and in additional cohorts of young Wistar 
rats at 14d and 28d. Behavioral and motor scores showed all groups exhibited 
significant impairment at 24h compared to baseline. Aged lean, aged Cp and young 
Wistar rats treated with IL-1Ra did however exhibit significantly better performance 
and smaller deficits at 24h and 7d reperfusion versus their control counterparts (Fig.3A, 
B, C). Placebo and IL-1Ra treated young Wistar rats returned to baseline by 28d 
reperfusion, though IL-1Ra treated animals had better outcomes versus placebo at 14d 
(Fig.3C). 
The cylinder test, used to measure forepaw asymmetry when the animal rears, revealed 
no bias of left and right forepaw usage in any of the groups prior to injury. At 24h all 
animals (placebo or IL-1Ra) displayed deficits in the usage of impaired ipsilateral and 
contralateral forepaw, which began to recover by 7d post-tMCAo (Supp. Fig.2A, B, C). 
IL-1Ra treated lean and young rats showed improvements in total number of rears 
versus their placebo treated counterparts at 24h and 7d (Supp. Fig.3A, C). There were 
   
13 
 
no differences in any groups in the use of ipsilateral forepaw, contralateral forepaw or 
both forepaws (data not shown) at any time point examined (Supp. Fig.2A, B, C).  
3.2. IL-1Ra increases neurogenesis  
Neurogenesis markers were examined by immunofluorescence at 7d reperfusion in aged 
leans, aged Cp and young Wistar rats, and only in the latter at 14d and 28d. We first 
analyzed proliferation of NPCs in the SVZ at 7d reperfusion using Ki67, a nuclear 
protein associated with cellular proliferation. We identified Ki67 immuno-positive cells 
in the SVZ, indicating the existence of NPCs proliferation in both placebo and IL-1Ra 
treated animals. An increase in the area of NPC proliferation was seen in all animals 
treated with IL-1Ra versus placebo-treated, though this was statistically significant only 
in aged lean and young Wistar rats (Fig.4A, B). In agreement with existing literature25, 
33, our results showed a positive but not significant correlation between lesion size at 
24h and proliferation of NPCs at 7d in young Wistar rats (R2=0.87, p=0.06) and no 
correlation for aged-comorbid rats (i.e. aged Lean rats: R2=0.2, p=0.44).  
To determine if NPCs have differentiated into immature neurons (neuroblasts) we 
stained for doublecortin (DCX), a microtubule associated phosphoprotein used as a 
neuroblast marker, and analyzed their migration through the corpus callosum towards 
the infarcted area. We identified DCX+ neuroblasts in the SVZ (zone 1) that migrated to 
the infarct (zones 2 and 3) in both placebo and IL-1Ra treated animals. When compared 
with placebo treated-animals IL-1Ra treatment increased the total number of immature 
neurons in the SVZ, as well as the migration of these cells to the infarct, in all groups at 
7d of reperfusion (Fig.5B, C), and in young animals at 14d (Supp. Fig.5A, B). 
We also studied the number of mature differentiated and integrated neurons 
(NeuN+/BrdU+/cFos+ cells) in the ipsilesional cortex of young Wistar rats at 28d after 
   
14 
 
the ischemic insult. Delayed IL-1Ra treatment resulted in increased numbers of new 
integrated neurons compared to the placebo treated animals (Fig.6B, C, D), 
demonstrating that IL-1Ra not only protects the ischemic brain but also increases 
neurogenesis after stroke.   
Finally, we analyzed if there was any correlation between the improvement in 
functional outcomes seen in the IL-1Ra treated groups with markers of neurogenesis 
(NPCs proliferation, DCX migration and number of new integrated neurons). Our 
results showed positive but not significant correlations between the behavioral (positive 
slopes) and motor (negative slopes) outcomes and proliferation (Ki67-area of staining) 
and neuroblast migration in all the IL-1Ra treated groups and no correlation for the 
same outcomes and same neurogenesis markers in the placebo groups in young Wistar 
and Lean/Cp rats (data not shown). In contrast, for young Wistar rats, correlations 
between behavior score/new neurons at 28d (positive slope) and the motor score/new 
neurons at 28d (negative slope) were positive in the IL-1Ra treated group up to 14d and 
only significant in this group up to 7d post-ischemia, and no correlations in the Placebo 
young Wistar for these parameters were observed (24h behavior score versus new 
neurons: R2=0.9454 and p=0.02; 7d behavior score versus new neurons: R2=0.9 and 
p=0.02; 24h motor score versus new neurons: R2=0.92 and p=0.04; 7d motor score 
versus new neurons: R2=0.95 and p=0.04). 
 
4. Discussion 
Our findings demonstrate that subcutaneous administration of IL-1Ra is neuroprotective 
in young and aged animals with multiple risk factors for stroke and increases post-
stroke neurogenesis.  
   
15 
 
It has previously been observed that delayed administration of IL-1Ra exerts 
neuroprotective effects at acute time points following experimental ischemia10, 21. Here 
we extend these findings to show that the early beneficial effects of IL-1Ra persist for at 
least 7 days in aged/co-morbid animals and for 28 days in young/healthy animals. 
Delayed administration of IL-1Ra resulted in a reduced infarct volume, a preservation 
of BBB integrity and improvements in some functional outcomes.  
A meta-analysis of pre-clinical research in cerebral ischemia showed in 2009 the 
potential benefit of IL-1Ra7 and in a recent cross-lab study performed across Europe, 
neuroprotective effects of IL-1Ra in experimental stroke were confirmed34. 
Furthermore, IL-1Ra showed some beneficial effects in a small phase II clinical study in 
acute stroke patients6. Our study confirms the protective nature of IL-1Ra in co-morbid 
animals at delayed time points, providing yet further validation of IL-1Ra as a highly 
promising therapy for ischemic stroke. 
Obesity is commonly associated with increased ischemic damage due to raised levels of 
pro-inflammatory cytokines and proteases35, 36. Our data show that although 13-month-
old corpulent rats had a plethora of stroke associated co-morbidities, infarct volumes 
were of a similar size to aged leans, suggesting that the extent of ischemic damage was 
close to maximal and that no further increase was possible. Conversely, younger rats 
were more resistant to the distal MCAO and occlusion time, showing only very small 
infarcts which necessitated a modification to the surgery protocol (tandem occlusion of 
the MCA and CCA) to attain similar infarcts across all strains for the purpose of 
examining neurogenesis. This suggests that age is the primary variable that increases the 
brain susceptibility to infarction following an ischemic stroke. However, despite 
reaching maximal levels of infarction, tissue is still salvageable under these 
circumstances if IL-1Ra is administered within a therapeutic window.  
   
16 
 
Edema often accompanies brain injury and is acknowledged as a critical component in 
the pathology of cerebral ischemia. The model of ischemia employed might explain the 
lack of reduction in edema seen here following IL-1Ra administration. In this model, a 
craniectomy is required to allow direct access and manipulation of the MCA, a 
procedure that alters intracranial pressure and thus the volume of edema37, 38. Previous 
studies from our lab have shown significant improvements in edema in rats treated with 
IL-1Ra who have undergone transient MCAO using the filament model, a model that 
does not involve craniectomy 11, 21.   
To demonstrate that IL-1Ra not only reduces the infarct size but also improves the 
functional outcome, we performed in young Wistar and in aged/comorbid animals two 
general tests to analyze motor and behavioral deficits, and the cylinder test to determine 
forepaw asymmetry when the animal rears. Although with the first two tests we have 
been able to see an improvement in function with IL-1Ra treatment up to 14d in young 
animals, modest results were obtained with the cylinder test, only observing some 
improvements in rearing in young Wistar and aged Lean cohorts. One possible reason 
for this lack of effect is that the stroke model used here affects only the sensorimotor 
cortex and produces smaller infarct volumes when compared to other models (i.e. the 
filament model). Despite the modest results obtained in the cylinder test, our other 
results demonstrate that IL-1Ra improves the stroke outcome at longer time points 
(using the motor and behavioral scales) and that these improvements in function 
correlate with some neurogenesis markers.  Beyond the acute phase of ischemic stroke, 
gross motor impairments generally resolve rapidly. It is therefore important to 
implement fine, long term motor testing to fully examine differences in genuine 
recovery and functional compensation and the effects of drug therapies on discrete 
motor deficits, as we have previously done with IL-1Ra11. As well as motor

impairments stroke survivors can experience a number of other complications, including 
cognitive decline, fatigue and depression. Evaluation of the effects of IL-1Ra and other 
potential stroke treatments on these parameters would be worthwhile, though at present 
the levels of such deficits in experimental stroke models remain poorly characterized. 
The capacity of the brain to reorganize and repair itself after stroke can be seen 
clinically, even in the case of aged individuals39. Aging and inflammatory co-
morbidities are generally associated with a decline in general cerebral function, however 
the extent to which neurogenesis is affected under such conditions is unclear. To 
explore effects of IL-1Ra on markers of neurogenesis following ischemia it was 
essential to ensure initial infarct volumes were consistent across placebo groups, since 
there is a direct correlation between progenitor cell proliferation and infarct size in rats 
and mice at 7 days recovery25, 40. In this study we observe that proliferating NPCs and 
neuroblasts are preserved in aged animals with different pre-existing inflammatory 
conditions, demonstrating the brain’s potential to repair itself is still viable in aged, co-
morbid strains. Furthermore, our results indicate that although the delayed 
administration of IL-1Ra (3 and 6h from reperfusion onset) reduces infarct volume, it 
produces an increase on cellular proliferation and migration of immature neurons versus 
placebo counterparts in the SVZ following stroke in young and aged/co-morbid rats, 
suggesting that a reduced inflammation of the tissue fosters a more efficient repair of 
the damaged tissue. We also show that IL-1Ra increases the number of new integrated 
neurons in areas surrounding the infarct lesion in young animals compared to placebo 
groups a result that correlates with improvements in motor and behavioral sub-acute 
outcomes. The benefits of IL-1Ra are therefore not limited to inducing neuroprotection, 
but also favor and promote neurorepair mechanisms.

Previous studies have examined the beneficial effects of IL-1Ra on neurogenesis in 
young healthy animals in models of chronic stress and Alzheimer’s disease like 
pathology41, 42. In agreement with this data, the detrimental actions of IL-1β on adult 
neurogenesis have also been observed in young mice with an IL-1β excisionally 
activated transgene which results in chronic expression of this cytokine43 . Despite all 
these promising studies, the authors conclude that further studies are required to fully 
elucidate the mechanisms through which IL-1Ra may be mediating its beneficial, 
neurogenic effects.  
In conclusion, we demonstrate that IL-1Ra protects against ischemic brain injury and 
improves functional recovery in aged/co-morbid animals when administered 
peripherally at delayed time points. Furthermore, IL-1Ra has the potential to improve 
neurogenesis in these animals, therefore providing a means of enhancing recovery in 
patients with a raised inflammatory burden.
