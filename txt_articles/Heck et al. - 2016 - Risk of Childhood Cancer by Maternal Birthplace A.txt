IMPORTANCE The Hispanic epidemiologic paradox is the phenomenon that non-US–born
Hispanic mothers who immigrate to the United States have better pregnancy outcomes than
their US-born counterparts. It is unknown whether this advantage extends to childhood
cancer risk.
OBJECTIVE To determine whether the risk for childhood cancers among Hispanic children
varies by maternal birthplace.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS In this population-based case-control study conducted
in June 2015, cohort members were identified through California birth records of children
born in California from January 1, 1983, to December 31, 2011. Information on cancer
diagnoses was obtained from California Cancer Registry records from 1988 to 2012. Cases
(n = 13 666) were identified from among children younger than 6 years in the California
Cancer Registry and matched to California birth certificates. Control children (n = 15 513 718)
included all other children born in California during the same period. Maternal birthplace and
ethnic ancestry were identified from the birth certificate.
MAIN EXPOSURES Maternal race/ethnicity and birthplace.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES We used Cox proportional hazards modeling to estimate
hazard ratios (HRs) of childhood cancer.
RESULTS Included in the study were 4 246 295 children of non-Hispanic white mothers
(51.3% male), 2 548 822 children of US-born Hispanic mothers (51.0% male), and 4 397 703
children of non-US–born Hispanic mothers (51.0% male). Compared with children of
non-Hispanic white mothers, the children of non-US–born Hispanic mothers had a reduced
risk for glioma (HR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.44-0.58), astrocytoma (HR, 0.43; 95% CI, 0.36-0.51),
neuroblastoma (HR, 0.47; 95% CI, 0.40-0.54), and Wilms tumor (HR, 0.70; 95% CI,
0.59-0.82). For these cancer types, the risk estimates for children of US-born Hispanic
mothers fell between those of the children of US-born white and non-US–born Hispanic
mothers. Children of Mexican-born mothers had a higher risk of yolk sac tumors (HR, 1.46;
95% CI, 0.99-2.17), while children of US-born Hispanic mothers with ancestry from countries
other than Mexico had a higher risk for unilateral retinoblastoma (HR, 2.03; 95% CI, 1.33-3.11).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE For several cancers, we observed differential risk by maternal
place of birth. Examining the differences in health behaviors and environment between
Hispanic groups may shed light on childhood cancer etiology.

T
he relative importance of an individual’
s genetics, en-
vironment,andlifestyleincancerriskisnevermoreevi-
dent than in studies of migrant populations. In an in-
creasingly globalized world, the United States is the top
destinationcountry,hosting20%(42.8million)ofallmigrants.1
The fact that 22% of young children (<6 years) born in the
United States have immigrant parents2 opens a unique oppor-
tunity to consider the influence of nativity and race/ethnicity
on the development and etiology of childhood cancers. In ad-
dition, there are many native racial/ethnic counterparts liv-
ing in the United States who, when studied, might provide
additional insights concerning the positive or negative conse-
quences of the social, economic, and environmental factors
that they may face in the host country.
Atpresent,nearly17%oftheUSpopulationisofHispanicori-
gin, and this proportion is expected to reach 30% by 2050.3 In
adults, the incidence of cancer differs between Hispanic and
whitepopulations.4Thisisalsotrueofchildhoodcancers,where
it has been noted that compared with non-Hispanic white chil-
dren,Hispanicchildrenexhibithigherratesofleukemias,osteo-
sarcoma,germ-celltumors,andretinoblastoma,aswellaslower
ratesofWilmstumorandcentralnervoussystem(CNS)tumors.5
In particular, CNS tumor rates among white American children
appear to be 2 to 3 times higher than those reported in children
inLatinAmericannations.6Further,differentialcancerrisksare
seen between non-US–born and US-born Hispanic individuals,
which has been attributed to behavioral differences such as to-
bacco use or reproductive history.7 While there have been spo-
radic reports on childhood cancer incidence among children of
immigrants in other nations,8,9 childhood cancer rates among
immigrant families in the United States have not, to our knowl-
edge, been compared to date. It is of particular importance to
studychildhoodcancerriskinthislargeandgrowingpopulation,
as the Hispanic population in California has among the highest
rates of childhood cancers worldwide.10
Given the importance of the prenatal environment on
childhoodcancer,theHispanicepidemiologicparadoxmayhelp
to shed light on childhood cancer risk. This paradox de-
scribes the phenomenon that non-US–born Hispanic moth-
ers who immigrate to the United States have better preg-
nancy outcomes than their US-born counterparts, such as
decreased rates of low birthweight. This advantage is ob-
served in immigrants despite high levels of poverty, lower ma-
ternaleducationalattainment,andlateentryintoprenatalcare
services. Although this pattern has been seen in women from
many nations, it is particularly evident among women from
Mexico.11Ourhypothesiswasthatthisperinataladvantagemay
extend to childhood cancer risk.
The goal of the present study was to compare childhood
cancer risk between the children of US-born white, US-born
Hispanic, and non-US–born Hispanic mothers.
Methods
Cohort
In this study conducted in June 2015, the cohort consisted of
all children born in California from January 1, 1983, to Decem-
ber 31, 2011. Cohort members were identified through Califor-
nia birth records. Information on cancer diagnoses was ascer-
tained from California Cancer Registry records of children
younger than 6 years who were diagnosed as having cancer
from 1988 to 2012.12 Our interest was the younger age group
because it is in that group that perinatal exposures should be
of most relevance for cancer risk. The California Cancer Reg-
istry was established in 1988 and is believed to ascertain more
than 99% of cancer cases diagnosed in the state. Using a proba-
bilistic linkage program (LinkPlus; US Centers for Disease Con-
trol and Prevention), we matched 89% of cases to a California
birth certificate using first name, last name, dates of birth, and,
when available, social security number. Given prior reports of
rates of residential mobility in early childhood among Califor-
niachildren,13itislikelythatmostoftheremaining11%ofcases
were born out of state.
California birth certificates ask parents to report their
race/ethnicity, Hispanic origin, and the mother’
s place of
birth (state or country). (We use the word Hispanic instead of
Latino herein because that is the nomenclature used by par-
ents on California birth certificates.) Mothers of Hispanic
origin were asked to identify their ethnic ancestry (Mexican/
Mexican American/Chicano; Puerto Rican; Cuban; Central/
South American; and other Spanish/Hispanic). Prior to
2009, California birth certificates did not collect all possible
countries of birth of the mother. Thus, we categorized moth-
ers as non-US–born if they were born in Puerto Rico, the Vir-
gin Islands, Guam, Mexico, China, Japan, the Philippines,
Vietnam, Canada, Cuba, or the rest of the world. Beginning
in 2009, birth certificates began collecting birthplace from
292 countries. The present analysis was restricted to the
children of US-born white, US-born Hispanic, or non-
US–born Hispanic mothers and included 13 666 cases of
those diagnosed as having cancer before age 6 years and
15 513 718 control children, who had no diagnosis in the Can-
cer Registry prior to age 6 years.
Thisstudywasapprovedbytheinstitutionalreviewboards
of the University of California–Los Angeles, and the Commit-
tee for Protection of Human Subjects. Patient consent was not
required because this was a noncontact study.
Key Points
Question Does the Hispanic epidemiologic paradox, whereby
non-US–born Hispanic mothers in the United States have better
pregnancy outcomes than their US-born counterparts, extend to
childhood cancer risk?
Findings For some cancer types (gliomas, astrocytoma,
neuroblastoma, and nephroblastoma), the patterns exhibited
followed the Hispanic paradox, with lower risk among the children
of non-US–born mothers. The patterns of other cancer types
suggest other risk factors may be driving those tumors.
Meaning The differential cancer risks by maternal place of birth
supports that for some cancers, examining the different health
behaviors and environment among Hispanic groups may shed light
on childhood cancer etiology.

Statistical Analysis
Inthemainanalyses,wereportedoncancersubtypesforwhich
there were at least 10 cases in each group. Childhood cancer
types were coded according to International Classification of
Childhood Cancer–3 or International Classification of Dis-
eases for Oncology codes (eTable in the Supplement). Cohort
members were followed up from date of birth until their first
diagnosis of cancer, death, until age 6 years, or until Decem-
ber 31, 2012, whichever occurred first. The study design did
not allow us to ascertain whether a child left California dur-
ing the study period. To determine whether risks are converg-
ing to those of the US white population for the children of US-
bornHispanicmothers,weusedchildrenofnon-Hispanicwhite
mothers as the comparison group. Estimation of hazard ra-
tios (HRs) was based on Cox proportional hazards models. All
analyses adjusted for the mother’
s age and father’
s age. Addi-
tional adjustment for urban/rural area of residence and for ges-
tational factors (parity and multiple birth pregnancies, as de-
scribed previously14) did not change effect estimates by more
than 10% and were left out of final models. Although socio-
economic status is not clearly associated with childhood can-
cer risk,15 we conducted sensitivity analyses examining the
change in results with adjustment for socioeconomic status
variables.Twoproxiesforsocioeconomicstatus,maternaledu-
cation and the method of payment for prenatal care (private
insurance vs Medi-Cal, other governmental insurance, or self-
pay) were collected starting in 1989. The addition of these fac-
tors widened confidence intervals owing to the loss of 6 years
of data; however, the overall pattern of results did not change.
Thus, we left these factors out of final models.
Because 80% of Hispanic mothers in California identify
their ethnic ancestry as Mexican,16 we conducted additional
analyses stratifying by Mexican and Mexican American vs all
other Hispanic ethnicities, although sample sizes were small

for some cancer types. We defined Mexican individuals as both
identified as being of Mexican ethnic ancestry and born in
Mexico; Mexican American individuals identified them-
selves as being of Mexican ethnic ancestry and were born in
the United States. SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute) was used to
perform all analyses in this study.
Results
Demographic and socioeconomic characteristics of partici-
pants are shown in Table 1. Compared with white parents, non-
US–born Hispanic mothers and fathers were younger, more
likely to live in urban areas in California, and had fewer years
of educational attainment. In comparison with non-US–born
Hispanic parents, US-born Hispanic parents were younger and
had more years of formal education.
ChildrenofUS-bornHispanicmothershadminimallyhigher

panicparentswerelesslikelythanwhiteparentstohaveprivate
health insurance or to have multiple-birth pregnancies. Parity
was higher among Hispanic parents, particularly when the
mother was not born in the United States.
Several cancer types showed differences in risk among all
Hispanic children in comparison with white children (Table 3
and eFigure in the Supplement). Acute lymphoblastic leuke-
mia (HR, 1.20; 95% CI, 1.10-1.32 for children of US-born His-
panic mothers; HR, 1.06; 95% CI, 0.98-1.15 for children of non-
US–bornHispanicmothers)andHodgkinlymphoma(HR,2.49;
95%CI,1.21-5.13forchildrenofUS-bornHispanicmothers;HR,
2.35; 95% CI, 1.24-4.47 for children of non-US–born Hispanic
mothers) were higher among Hispanic children regardless of
maternal nativity, while most types of CNS tumors were lower
among Hispanic children. Glioma (HR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.61-
0.83 for children of US-born Hispanic mothers; HR, 0.50; 95%
CI, 0.44-0.58 for children of non-US–born Hispanic mothers)
and neuroblastoma (HR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.56-0.78 for children
of US-born Hispanic mothers; HR, 0.47; 95% CI, 0.40-0.54 for
children of non-US–born Hispanic mothers) HRs were lower
amongallHispanicchildrencomparedwithwhitechildren.And
for both gliomas and neuroblastoma, the HRs were lowest
among children of non-US–born Hispanic mothers. The rate
of Wilms tumor was lower only among children of non-
US–born Hispanic mothers (HR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.59-0.82). An
elevated HR for bone tumors, with wide confidence inter-
vals, was found among children of US-born Hispanic mothers
only (HR, 1.38; 95% CI, 0.83-2.31).
When we further restricted the Hispanic category to Mexi-
can individuals, we observed more sharply decreased HRs for
non-Hodgkin lymphoma (HR, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.37-0.92), epen-
dymomas(HR,0.69;95%CI,0.49-0.97),andWilmstumor(HR,
0.69; 95% CI, 0.58-0.82) among the offspring of Mexican-
born mothers, while yolk sac tumors were found to be in-
creasedinchildrenofMexicanmothers(HR,1.46;95%CI,0.99-
2.17) (Table 4).
Among the children of non-Mexican US-born Hispanic
mothers, we observed an increased risk for unilateral retino-
blastoma (HR, 2.03; 95% CI, 1.33-3.11), but otherwise similar
patterns of cancer to those seen among Hispanic children as a
whole (Table 5).

Discussion
Although numerous migrant studies have been published in
the literature, to our knowledge, few have examined cancer
risk among Hispanic immigrants to the United States and no
previous study has examined childhood cancer risk among US
immigrantpopulations.StudiesinSwedenandtheUnitedKing-
dom suggested that differences exist in childhood cancer in-
cidence between immigrant and native populations.8,9 For
many cancer types, research on migrant groups has often
shown that the initial difference in the incidence of cancer of
immigrants changes over 1 or 2 generations to converge to the
incidence in the new host population.17 Similarly, our study
suggests that the children of non-US–born Hispanic mothers
retain, at least in part, the cancer risk observed in their coun-
tries of origin.18 In this study, we observed notable differ-
ences across groups in risk for gliomas and several specific CNS
tumor types (high-grade gliomas, low-grade gliomas, epen-
dymoma, astrocytoma, and intracranial and intraspinal em-
bryonal tumors), as well as unilateral retinoblastoma, bone tu-
mors, yolk sac tumors, and neuroblastoma.
As has been reported elsewhere,5,18 we observed that His-
panic children experience overall higher risk for acute lympho-
blastic leukemia and lower risk for CNS tumors, Wilms tumors,
andneuroblastomacomparedwithnon-Hispanicwhitechildren.
There are several hypotheses why Hispanic children may have

dren,includingbothgeneticvariationordifferingratesofexpo-
suretoinfectionsinearlylife.19,20 Wealsoobservedexcessesof

rus.Epstein-Barrvirus–positiveHodgkinlymphomaismorecom-
monamongHispanicindividualsandisassociatedwithmixed-
cellularity subtype, which we previously observed to be more
common among Hispanic children in our sample.21
The elevated risks for bone tumors among the children of
US-born Hispanic mothers, in comparison with the lower risk
amongthechildrenofnon-US–bornHispanicmothers,wasno-
table given what is known about differences in height be-
tween Mexican and Mexican American individuals.22 Height
is a risk factor for several adult cancers23 and has been impli-
cated in some studies of osteosarcoma and Ewing sarcoma.24

to be explained by the positive influence of traditional Mexican
culture, eg, positive attitudes about pregnancy as well as good
care and support of the pregnant woman by her family, which

totheirnon-US–borncounterparts,US-bornHispanicwomenex-

lower-quality diets, higher levels of overweight, and excessive
weight gain in pregnancy; are less likely to breastfeed; and are
more likely to report any substance use during pregnancy, al-

For several other cancer types (non-Hodgkin lymphoma,

panic mothers, suggesting that the behavioral and environ-
mental factors mentioned here play little role in the etiology
of these tumors. Little is known on the etiology of yolk sac tu-

viously reported among Hispanic individuals.38

sensitivity (99%) in capturing Hispanic ethnicity.39 A source
of bias in our study would be whether non-US–born parents
returned to their country of origin for the child’
s diagnosis and
treatment or whether non-US–born parents have greater resi-
dential mobility than US-born Hispanic parents. However, one
study of California children with leukemia did not find any dif-
ferencesinresidentialmobilitybymaternalnativity.12Also,the
very high rates of childhood cancers among Los Angeles His-
panic children—as noted by Kaatsch,10 Hispanic children in Los
AngelesCountyhaveamongthehighestchildhoodcancerrates
worldwide—would support that most are diagnosed as hav-
ing cancer while in the United States.

Conclusions
The differing risk observed among children of immigrant
and US-born Hispanic mothers was evident for several child-
hood cancer types. At present, to our knowledge, there are
limited studies on the distribution of genotypes related to
childhood cancer among Hispanic individuals, and small
sample sizes in most childhood cancer studies limit further
explorations of genetic variation among ethnic subgroups.
Incorporating the immigrant experience into studies of
childhood cancer may help to inform research on disease eti-
ology, identify vulnerable populations, and highlight oppor-
tunities for cancer prevention. Further studies should
explore the differences in risk incurred by variation in envi-
ronmental, behavioral, and infectious exposures between
non-US– and US-born Hispanic mothers.
