Background: Autologous fat transfer, also known as lipofilling, is a minimally invasive technique that uses
the patient’
s own fat to correct disfiguring sequelae after breast cancer surgery. Despite its obvious clinical
benefits, experimental research has demonstrated that autologous fat transfer inherently stimulates
angiogenesis and tissue regeneration, which is feared to increase the risk of locoregional recurrence of
breast cancer. This meta-analysis is founded on recently completed large cohort studies on this highly
relevant topic.
Methods: A literature search was performed in PubMed, Embase and the Cochrane Library on 1
September 2017, adhering to the PRISMA guidelines, to identify all relevant studies of patients with
breast cancer exposed to autologous fat transfer. The difference in incidence rate of locoregional
recurrence between patients who had autologous fat transfer and controls was the primary outcome in
the meta-analysis.
Results: Fifty-nine studies and a total of 4292 patients were included. These consisted of seven matched
cohorts, 12 cohorts and 40 case series. Mean follow-up was 5⋅7 years from the date of primary cancer
surgery and 2⋅7 years after autologous fat transfer. Meta-analysis of matched cohorts revealed an incidence
rate difference of –0⋅15 (95 per cent c.i. –0⋅36 to 0⋅07) per cent per year, which was not statistically
significant (P = 0⋅419). This finding was confirmed in the pooled results of the remaining cohorts and
case series.
Conclusion: This meta-analysis of all oncological data from the published literature demonstrated that
autologous fat transfer did not result in an increased rate of locoregional recurrence in patients with
breast cancer. Autologous fat transfer can therefore be performed safely in breast reconstruction after
breast cancer.
An early and outdated version of this meta-analysis was presented to the Sixth European Association of Plastic Surgeons
Research Council Meeting, Pisa, Italy, May 2017

Introduction
Breast cancer is the most common malignancy in women
worldwide, with 1⋅7 million new cases annually and a global
burden that surpasses that of all other cancers1. Through
improved early detection and treatment, the number of
women surviving is gradually increasing, thereby shifting
the focus towards improving quality of life and reducing
cancer-related morbidity. As a result, an organ-saving sur-
gical approach in the form of breast-conserving surgery
(BCS) has been established as the standard of care for
the majority of patients. Although current oncoplastic
and breast reconstructive surgical techniques can restore
the original breast contours successfully after oncological
surgery, they fall short in their ability to eliminate remain-
ing smaller deformities, which in some instances can be
equally disfiguring and stigmatizing for the patient.
Autologous fat transfer (AFT) is a minimally invasive
technique that excels in correcting various soft tissue
deformities using liposuctioned fat tissue (Fig. 1). In
essence, AFT involves harvesting fat tissue by means of
liposuction and reinjecting it into an area of the breast

Fig. 1 Schematic overview of the autologous fat transfer (AFT) technique. It comprises three steps: harvesting using liposuction;
processing (centrifugation); and reinjection into an area with soft tissue deformity. a–c Examples of the spectrum of indications that
could profit from AFT treatment. a Deformities after lumpectomy with visible retraction of the scars, often exacerbated by irradiation.
Such defects are normally too small to warrant reconstruction with implants or flaps and AFT remains the only reconstructive option.
b Flap-based reconstruction (such as the deep inferior epigastric perforator (DIEP flap) with visible step-off deformities between the
native tissue and the flap. c Implant reconstruction with visible implant rippling and volume deficiency in the cleavage area. (The left
part of the figure has been published previously by Krastev et al.2)
with a deformity, hence the popular term ‘
lipofilling’
.
Angiogenesis facilitates the survival of a major part of the
injected fat cells resulting in a successful transplantation.
Its low morbidity, and the prospect of achieving autologous
breast reconstruction without relying on invasive pedicled
or free-flap transfer, makes AFT an attractive procedure
within the process of breast reconstruction.
Unfortunately, a major drawback to the widespread appli-
cation of AFT after breast cancer has been the uncertainty
regarding its oncological safety. Research in the field of
stem cells and tissue engineering has led to the discov-
ery of a previously underappreciated population of mes-
enchymal stem cells residing in adipose tissue, referred
to as adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs)3. ADSCs are
thought to play a key role in the survival of adipocytes
after AFT by stimulating angiogenesis and tissue regener-
ation through the secretion of a variety of cytokines and
growth factors4. This has raised concerns that the inten-
tional placement of regenerative cells in a previous tumour
bed could potentially increase the risk of locoregional
recurrence (LRR). Experiments in immunodeficient nude
mice have shown that ADSCs co-injected with active
tumour cells display an increased rate of cancer growth
and proliferation5–7. It is questionable whether the inter-
actions between human ADSCs and cancer cells that were
modelled in immunodeficient mice can be extrapolated to
the clinical setting. Nearly a decade later, however, clinical
research has not been able to answer this question, while
the use of AFT is gradually increasing in clinical practice.
Evaluating the oncological safety of AFT has posed
unprecedented challenges for both the oncological and
plastic surgical communities. AFT represents a novel treat-
ment that is fundamentally different from conventional
reconstructive techniques and therefore lacks an accept-
able alternative to use in a control group. As this ren-
ders setting up RCT
s unpractical and even unethical,
researchers have approached this topic through retrospec-
tive case series and (matched) cohort studies. Although

Fig. 2 Flow diagram showing selection of articles for review. *For example, platelet-rich plasma, stem-cell enrichment
the majority of these studies have consistently reported
no increased rate of LRR after AFT, they are individually
underpowered to provide conclusive evidence. Published
systematic reviews2,8–12 so far have consisted chiefly of
descriptive summaries of results from individual studies. A
meta-analysis was attempted on only one occasion8, ulti-
mately pooling data from three cohort studies, two of
which consisted of overlapping populations with high het-
erogeneity (I2 = 56 per cent). Therefore, the oncological
safety of AFT in breast reconstruction after breast cancer
surgery remains a topic of much debate.
With the increased rate of AFT in breast reconstruction
worldwide, there is an urgent need to determine whether
this treatment could potentially compromise oncological
safety in patients with breast cancer, before a false sense
of security engenders wide adoption in clinical practice. A
meta-analysis on the oncological safety of AFT after breast
cancer was undertaken, which aimed to address this highly
controversial topic by integrating all relevant evidence and
to provide a more reliable answer than the results of each
individual study.
Methods
The research objectives were to identify, evaluate and syn-
thesize the evidence examining the risk of LRR in patients
treated with AFT after breast cancer surgery.
Search strategy and selection criteria
This systematic review adhered to the standards of the
PRISMA statement13. A comprehensive, reproducible
electronic search was conducted in PubMed, EMBASE
and the Cochrane Library to identify all published stud-
ies of women receiving AFT for breast reconstruction
after surgery for breast cancer (Table S1, supporting

interval between primary surgery and autologous fat transfer (AFT); period B, interval between AFT and end of follow-up; and period
C, total oncological follow-up (A + B). a Matched cohort studies comprised patients who underwent AFT and were subsequently
matched with controls from the same institution based on relevant baseline characteristics. Patients were included only if they were
disease-free before AFT (period A) to be matched with controls who had the same disease-free period. b In unmatched cohort studies,
the AFT group was compared with controls with similar baseline characteristics from the same institution, who did not undergo AFT.
c Case series typically investigated the incidence of locoregional recurrence (LRR) in a group of consecutive patients who had AFT

information). The search was last performed on 1
September 2017. The retrieved articles were screened
by two independent reviewers based on the title and
abstract using predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria
(Fig. 2). Only studies focusing on evaluating oncological
events in patients treated with AFT were considered for
inclusion. Potentially relevant articles, as well as those
with insufficient information in the title and abstract, were
selected for full-text review. Disagreements were resolved
through discussion until consensus was reached.

Fig. 4 Forest plot showing incidence rate difference (IRD) in locoregional recurrence (LRR) in period B between the autologous fat
transfer (AFT) and control groups in matched cohort studies. Analyses were carried out for all patients, and for subgroups of patients
who underwent mastectomy or breast-conserving surgery, and subgroups with invasive or in situ carcinomas. IRDs are shown with 95
per cent confidence intervals. A random-effects (RE) model was used for all meta-analyses
Data analysis
A data extraction sheet was developed in Excel® (Microsoft,
Redmond, Washington, USA), pilot-tested and refined
accordingly
(Table S2,
supporting
information).
Both
reviewers performed a thorough data extraction for all
relevant outcomes. In addition, studies were assessed
for the risk of overlap and bias according to method-
ological standards of the Cochrane Handbook of Systematic
Reviews of Interventions14. On some occasions, authors were
contacted to provide additional data. Whenever necessary,
units were standardized to ensure comparability and allow
pooling of data. For continuous variables reported using
median (range) values, corresponding mean(s.d.) values
were estimated using the standard equations used for
meta-analyses15.
The incidence rate of LRR was the primary out-
come of interest, as it corrects for the variable length of
follow-up between studies. It is defined as the percentage
of patients experiencing LRR events per year of follow-up

Fig. 5 Forest plot showing incidence rate difference (IRD) in locoregional recurrence (LRR) in period C between the autologous fat
transfer (AFT) and control groups in unmatched cohorts. Analyses were carried out for all patients, and for subgroups of patients who
underwent mastectomy or breast-conserving surgery, and subgroups with invasive or in situ carcinomas. IRDs are shown with 95 per
cent confidence intervals. A random-effects (RE) model was used for all meta-analyses
as represented by the following formula:
Incidence rate (% per year) =
no. of events
total patient-years
=
no. of events
(number of patients)×(mean follow-up)
T
o deal with differences in the methodology and meas-
urement of outcomes, two different summary measures
were applied in this meta-analysis. The incidence rate
difference (IRD) was used for cohort studies that provided
data on the LRR rate for both AFT and control groups. A
Wald-type test was used to test for significance between the
groups (and subgroups). Owing to the absence of control
groups, only the raw incidence rate could be computed in
the remaining case series. T
o place the measured pooled
effect estimate in context for the general breast cancer
population, it was compared with the reported incidence
rates in large historical cohorts.

Fig. 6 Forest plot showing raw incidence rate of locoregional recurrence (LRR) in period B in case series and the autologous fat transfer
(AFT) groups in cohort studies. Incidence rates are shown with 95 per cent confidence intervals. The dotted line indicates the expected
LRR rate. A random-effects (RE) model was used for meta-analysis
The meta-analysis was performed using the metafor
package16 of RStudio software, version 1.0.136 (R Foun-
dation
for
Statistical
Computing,
Vienna,
Austria).
Summary measures (incidence rates) were pooled in a
Poisson–normal random-effects model and presented
as forest plots. Heterogeneity was assessed using the I2
statistic, which was tolerable if the I2 value was below 40
per cent. Publication bias was considered acceptable if the
distribution of studies was approximately symmetrical on
visual inspection of funnel plots.
Results
Study characteristics
The electronic search yielded a total of 861 articles (Fig. 2).
Screening of titles and abstracts resulted in the inclusion
of 160 studies for further evaluation. A total of 59 clinical
trials were selected through further screening of the full
text (Table 1; an expanded version is available as Table S3,
supporting information) (References 17–74 and T. Krastev
et al., unpublished results). These consisted of 40 case series

Fig. 8 Forest plot showing raw incidence rate of locoregional recurrence (LRR) in period B in case series and the autologous fat transfer
(AFT) groups in cohort studies, according to histology of carcinoma. Incidence rates are shown with 95 per cent confidence intervals.
The dotted line indicates the expected LRR rate. A random-effects (RE) model was used for all meta-analyses
and 19 cohort studies, undertaken between 1983 and 2016.
Trials conducted by the same authors or institutions over
the same treatment period were assessed for the possibility
of overlap, and only the latest or largest study was used in
the meta-analysis.
After excluding overlapping studies, the remaining 40
studies comprised 4292 unique patients with breast cancer,
with a mean age of 50 (95 per cent c.i. 48 to 51) years, who
subsequently underwent AFT for the purpose of correct-
ing breast deformities. In 3076 women (71⋅7 per cent), it
involved defects after mastectomy and breast reconstruc-
tion (autologous or implant-based), whereas in 1049 (24⋅4
per cent) AFT was performed for the correction of dis-
figuring sequelae after BCS (Fig. 1). In the remaining 167
(3⋅9 per cent), the type of oncological surgery was not
specified. Histopathological characteristics of the primary
tumour were reported in 2214 patients; there were 1896
(85⋅6 per cent) invasive and 318 (14⋅4 per cent) in situ
carcinomas. The Bloom and Richardson classification was
reported in 897 patients, consisting of 170 grade 1 (19⋅0
per cent), 383 grade 2 (42⋅7 per cent) and 344 grade 3
(38⋅4 per cent) tumours. Breast cancer stage was specified
in 2103 patients; 453 patients had stage 0 disease (21⋅5 per
cent), 800 stage I (38⋅0 per cent), 637 stage II (30⋅3 per
cent), 207 stage III (9⋅8 per cent) and six stage IV (0⋅3 per
cent). With respect to studies that provided adequate data
on (neo)adjuvant treatment, 1631 of 3095 patients (52⋅7 per
cent) were treated with radiotherapy, 914 of 1988 (46⋅0 per
cent) with chemotherapy, and 391 of 753 (51⋅9 per cent)
with endocrine therapy and immunotherapy.
Relevant control groups from the 14 cohort stud-
ies included patients who had undergone surgery for
breast cancer who did not have AFT for the purpose of
breast reconstruction during oncological follow-up. They

comprised 4499 patients with a mean age of 51 (95 per
cent c.i. 48 to 53) years, of whom 3626 (80⋅6 per cent)
and 873 (19⋅4 per cent) were treated with mastectomy
and BCS respectively. Of the 3967 patients with specified
histological characteristics of the tumours, 3377 (85⋅1 per
cent) had invasive and 590 (14⋅9 per cent) in situ carci-
nomas. The Bloom and Richardson classification in 1972
patients was grade 1 in 340 (17⋅2 per cent), grade 2 in 932
(47⋅3 per cent) and grade 3 in 700 (35⋅5 per cent). Tumour
stage was specified in 2826 patients, and was stage 0 in 482
(17⋅1 per cent), stage I in 1012 (35⋅8 per cent), stage II in
1016 (36⋅0 per cent), stage III in 313 (11⋅1 per cent) and
stage IV in three (0⋅1 per cent). Regarding (neo)adjuvant
treatment, 1385 of 3288 patients (42⋅1 per cent) received
radiotherapy, 1477 of 2429 (60⋅8 per cent) chemotherapy
and 735 of 1353 (54⋅3 per cent) endocrine therapy.
In each of the seven matched-cohort studies (References
31, 32, 57–59, 70 and T. Krastev et al., unpublished results),
each individual patient who underwent AFT was matched
to one or more control subjects based on relevant prog-
nostic factors such as age, date of cancer surgery, type of
cancer surgery, tumour histology, tumour size, lymph node
involvement, Bloom and Richardson grade, disease stage,
oestrogen receptor status, progesterone receptor status and
human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 overexpression.
This was done to minimize the possibility of confound-
ing resulting from differences in baseline characteristics
between the groups.
Oncological follow-up
T
o allow comparison between the included studies, the
oncological follow-up in each study was subdivided into
three intervals for the purpose of this meta-analysis (Fig. 3).
Period A was defined as the interval between the primary
oncological intervention (mastectomy or BCS) and the first
AFT procedure, with a mean of 2⋅9 (range 0–6⋅5) years. In
matched cohort studies, this interval represented a required
LRR-free period for both AFT and control subjects, and
was a mean of 3⋅3 (2⋅1–4⋅7) years. Period B represented
the interval between the first AFT procedure and the end
of oncological follow-up (censoring time), and was a mean
of 2⋅7 (0⋅8–7⋅5) years for all studies. The sum of the two,
representing the total oncological follow-up after primary
surgery (period C), was a mean of 5⋅7 (1⋅0–12⋅1) years for
all patients treated with AFT and 5⋅1 (3⋅0–10⋅0) years for
controls from cohort studies.
Results of meta-analysis
The IRD was used to compare the LRR rate between
patients who had AFT and corresponding controls from
cohort studies. Meta-analysis of the seven matched cohorts
(References 31, 32, 57–59, 70 and T. Krastev et al., unpub-
lished results), investigating the incidence of LRR for
period B, showed an IRD of –0⋅15 (95 per cent c.i. –0⋅36 to
0⋅07) per cent per year, indicating a 0⋅15 per cent per year
lower raw incidence rate of LRR in patients who under-
went AFT compared with the controls (Fig. 4). This differ-
ence was, however, not statistically significant (P = 0⋅419).
Similarly, no significant differences were identified within
subgroups based on the type of cancer surgery (mastectomy
or BCS) and tumour histology (invasive or in situ).
Additional meta-analysis of the remaining unmatched
cohorts26,40,42,44,47,49,61,68,71 was possible only for the IRD
of LRR for period C, as control subjects did not have
a disease-free interval (period A) equivalent to that in
the AFT group. The overall IRD was –0⋅27 (–0⋅43 to
–0⋅11) per cent per year, with a significantly lower overall
LRR rate among patients who had AFT (P = 0⋅004). The
difference was also significant in the mastectomy subgroup
(P = 0⋅035) (Fig. 5).
Finally, data from all non-overlapping populations in
case series17–19,21,24,27,28,30,33,35,36,38,43,46,50,52–54,56,63,64,67,72,74
as well as AFT treatment arms of cohort studies (Refer-
ences 26, 31, 32, 39–42, 45, 47, 49, 61, 68, 70, 71 and
T. Krastev et al., unpublished results) were pooled to pro-
vide an estimate of the combined incidence rate of LRR
after exposure to AFT (period B). The raw incidence rate
for all patients was 0⋅73 (0⋅56 to 0⋅94) per cent per year
(Fig. 6). Subgroup meta-analyses revealed raw incidence
rates of 0⋅79 (0⋅61 to 1⋅01) per cent per year in patients who
underwent mastectomy and 0⋅57 (0⋅23 to 1⋅40) per cent per
year among those who had BCS (Fig. 7). Likewise, raw inci-
dence rates were 0⋅83 (0⋅63 to 1⋅09) per cent per year for
patients with invasive carcinomas and 0⋅45 (0⋅10 to 1⋅89)
per cent per year for those with in situ carcinomas (Fig. 8).
Discussion
Over the past decade, AFT has gained increasing pop-
ularity among both clinicians and patients, owing to its
distinct advantages over conventional treatments, offer-
ing an autologous reconstruction using a minimally inva-
sive approach. The high demand is being dampened only
by uncertainty regarding its oncological safety, which has
restricted its application in recent years. T
o date, no RCT
s
have been completed to investigate this matter and such tri-
als are unlikely to be initiated in the near future because of
practical and ethical concerns. Therefore, the best evidence
regarding the oncological safety of AFT after breast can-
cer surgery is retrieved from matched cohort studies and
retrospective case series.

 Oncological safety of autologous fat transfer after breast cancer
1093
A number of previous systematic reviews2,8–12 and one
small meta-analysis8 have attempted to evaluate the onco-
logical safety of AFT, but these studies were hindered by
the low quality and the small number of studies. Moreover,
none of them accounted for possible study overlap or dif-
ferentiated between BCS and mastectomy procedures.
With a large number of relevant studies published over
the past few years, the present systematic review and
meta-analysis identified 60–94 per cent more relevant,
non-overlapping studies than its predecessors2,8–12. This
meta-analysis therefore delivers an up-to-date overview of
the current evidence and facilitates intuitive interpreta-
tion by clinicians, guidelines committees and policymak-
ers. In addition, it provides the foundation upon which
evidence-based recommendations can be made regarding
the oncological safety of AFT in breast reconstruction.
The
present
review
incorporated
data
from
41
non-overlapping studies that reported LRR events in
patients with breast cancer. They comprised a total of
4292 unique patients with AFT and 4499 controls. The
first meta-analysis of exclusively matched cohorts (Fig. 4)
forms the essence of the present results and recommend-
ations. In the absence of high-quality data from random-
ized trials, these studies remain the best available evidence
to date. T
ypically, authors employed propensity score
matching techniques to pair each patient undergoing AFT
with one or more control subjects not exposed to AFT with
matching demographic and oncological characteristics.
In this way, matched cohort studies were able to select
control groups with matching baseline characteristics,
thereby reducing the risk of confounding and allowing
more accurate assessment of the absolute effect of AFT
on the LRR rate. Pooled data from 1137 patients who had
AFT and 1874 matched controls revealed no significant
IRD in LRR events overall, or in the subgroups treated
with either mastectomy or BCS, and among patients with
invasive or in situ carcinomas.
The second meta-analysis (Fig. 5) included oncologi-
cal data from the remaining (unmatched) cohorts, where
patients from the same institution not treated with AFT
were selected as a control group. As these studies reported
the rate of LRR in controls for the whole oncological
follow-up, the meta-analysis was limited to the evalua-
tion of LRR events for the total follow-up, and served to
assess only whether alarming overall rates of LRR could
be detected in the AFT group. Remarkably, this analy-
sis revealed a significantly lower overall incidence rate in
the AFT group compared with controls, as well as among
patients who had AFT in the mastectomy subgroup. Apart
from selection bias, for example resulting from differences
in baseline characteristics in the absence of matching, it
can be argued that preselection could have taken place if
patients undergoing breast reconstruction with AFT were
more likely to be disease-free before the treatment. This
could ultimately result in underestimation of the overall
rate of LRR after AFT compared with controls if patients
with early recurrence did not qualify for AFT. Therefore,
although high rates of LRR were not observed in patients
exposed to AFT compared with controls, the methodolog-
ical shortcomings of these studies undermine their validity
in assessing the outcome of interest.
The raw incidence rate of LRR after AFT in all 4272
patients with breast cancer was 0⋅73 (95 per cent c.i.
0⋅56 to 0⋅94) per cent per year, which falls within the
range reported in the literature (0⋅73–1⋅25 per cent per
year)75–78. Similarly, the mastectomy and BCS subgroups,
as well patients with invasive carcinomas and those with in
situ carcinomas, did not show high rates of LRR. Although
these results confirm the findings of cohort studies, data
from case series can be subject to important method-
ological flaws. As with unmatched cohorts, it is possible
that preselection could result in populations with more
favourable prognosis than the typical patient with breast
cancer. In addition, the small sample sizes and relatively
short follow-up could have been insufficient to detect can-
cer recurrences in many of the case series. As a result of
these factors, it is possible that case series grossly underes-
timate the true incidence rate of LRR and therefore can-
not reliably measure this outcome. As with results from
unmatched cohorts, these findings merely served as an
extra check that LRR rates were not alarmingly high when
the scope of the meta-analysis was broadened to include all
patients treated with AFT in published studies.
The main limitation of this meta-analysis is that it is
restricted to retrospective studies. Although RCT
s on this
subject are lacking for practical and ethical reasons, the
publication of several matched cohort studies over the
past few years has offered a viable alternative to assessing
the LRR rate in patients with breast cancer treated with
AFT. Another limitation is the use of summary measures
from included studies such as the raw incidence rate or
IRD, derived from the number of LRR events per total
patient-years of follow-up, to correct for differences in
follow-up between the included studies. Unfortunately,
this method does not take into account the exact timing
of censoring in the follow-up of each subject, which is
best assessed by the Kaplan–Meier method. As only a
small fraction of cohorts reported hazard ratios, it was
not possible to pool these in a separate meta-analysis.
In addition, the use of summary measures as opposed
to raw study data does not allow reliable assessment of
confounders and can mask their effect in an individual

patient. These issues can be resolved only by analysing the
raw study data, ideally in the form of an individual-patient
data meta-analysis.
Most studies reported a follow-up of around 3 years
after AFT exposure and 6 years in total. Theoretically,
regenerative effects from activated ADSCs should take
effect during the first few months up to a year after fat
transfer. However, it is unclear whether LRRs developing
more than 5 years after treatment can be attributed to AFT
as opposed to the natural history of breast cancer. Future
studies should assess the safety of AFT over a follow-up
of at least 5 years after initial exposure. Last but not least,
it is not known whether the timing of AFT has an influ-
ence on the rate of LRR, considering that cancers of various
histopathological stages and receptor status show distinct
recurrence patterns, typically peaking between the first and
fifth year of oncological follow-up79.
The present meta-analysis did not demonstrate an
increased LRR rate among more than 4000 unique
patients across 59 studies. This confirms the results of
individual studies that AFT can be performed safely in
breast reconstruction after breast cancer surgery.
