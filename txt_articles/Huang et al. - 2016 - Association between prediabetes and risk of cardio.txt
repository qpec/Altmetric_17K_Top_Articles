Association between prediabetes and risk of cardiovascular 
disease and all cause mortality: systematic review and 
meta-analysis
Yuli Huang,1 Xiaoyan Cai,2 Weiyi Mai,3 Meijun Li,1,4 Yunzhao Hu1 
ABSTRACT
ObjeCtives
To evaluate associations between different definitions 
of prediabetes and the risk of cardiovascular disease 
and all cause mortality.
Design
Meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies.
Data sOurCes
Electronic databases (PubMed, Embase, and Google 
Scholar).
seleCtiOn Criteria
Prospective cohort studies from general populations 
were included for meta-analysis if they reported 
adjusted relative risks with 95% confidence intervals 
for associations between the risk of composite 
cardiovascular disease, coronary heart disease, 
stroke, all cause mortality, and prediabetes.
review methODs
Two authors independently reviewed and selected 
eligible studies, based on predetermined selection 
criteria. Prediabetes was defined as impaired fasting 
glucose according to the criteria of the American 
Diabetes Association (IFG-ADA; fasting glucose 5.6-6.9 
mmol/L), the WHO expert group (IFG-WHO; fasting 
glucose 6.1-6.9 mmol/L), impaired glucose tolerance 
(2 hour plasma glucose concentration 7.8-11.0 mmol/L 
during an oral glucose tolerance test), or raised 
haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) of 39-47 mmol/mol (5.7-6.4%) 
according to ADA criteria or 42-47 mmol/mol (6.0-
6.4%) according to the National Institute for Health 
and Care Excellence (NICE) guideline. The relative risks 
of all cause mortality and cardiovascular events were 
calculated and reported with 95% confidence 
intervals.
results
53 prospective cohort studies with 1 611 339 individuals 
were included for analysis. The median follow-up 
duration was 9.5 years. Compared with 
normoglycaemia, prediabetes (impaired glucose 
tolerance or impaired fasting glucose according to 
IFG-ADA or IFG-WHO criteria) was associated with an 
increased risk of composite cardiovascular disease 
(relative risk 1.13, 1.26, and 1.30 for IFG-ADA, IFG-WHO, 
and impaired glucose tolerance, respectively), 
coronary heart disease (1.10, 1.18, and 1.20, 
respectively), stroke (1.06, 1.17, and 1.20, respectively), 
and all cause mortality (1.13, 1.13 and 1.32, 
respectively). Increases in HBA1c to 39-47 mmol/mol or 
42-47 mmol/mol were both associated with an 
increased risk of composite cardiovascular disease 
(1.21 and 1.25, respectively) and coronary heart disease 
(1.15 and 1.28, respectively), but not with an increased 
risk of stroke and all cause mortality.
COnClusiOns
Prediabetes, defined as impaired glucose tolerance, 
impaired fasting glucose, or raised HbA1c, was 
associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular 
disease. The health risk might be increased in people 
with a fasting glucose concentration as low as 5.6 
mmol/L or HbA1c of 39 mmol/mol.
Introduction
Prediabetes is defined as an intermediate metabolic 
state between normoglycaemia and diabetes and 
includes those with impaired glucose tolerance and 
impaired fasting glucose.1  Although impaired glucose 
tolerance is consistently defined as a 2 hour plasma 
glucose concentration of 7.8-11.0 mmol/L during an 
oral glucose tolerance test, the cut-off point for diag-
nosis of impaired fasting glucose remains controver-
sial. The World Health Organization (WHO) defines 
impaired plasma glucose as fasting plasma glucose of 
6.1-6.9 mmol/L,2  while the 2003 American Diabetes 
Association (ADA) guideline recommended a cut-off 
point of 5.6-6.9 mmol/L.3  The ADA’s proposal for 
defining impaired fasting glucose is contentious and 
has not been adopted by other international guide-
lines for diabetes management.4 5  Some researchers 
opposed to the change believe that it greatly increases 
the prevalence of what is classified as impaired fast-
ing glucose without any clear association with clini-
cal complications,6 7  especially for cardiovascular 
disease and all cause mortality. Although some pro-
spective studies have shown that the 2003 ADA 
 
category of impaired fasting glucose with the lower 
cut-off point is associated with an increased risk of

cardiovascular disease,8 9  other studies have not 
found a similar association.10-12  Several previous 
meta-analyses have led to conflicting conclusions,13-15 
which might be because of differences in endpoint 
assessments and inclusion criteria. Furthermore, the 
ADA also suggested haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) of 39-47 
mmol/mol (5.7-6.4%) could be used as another marker 
to define prediabetes, while the National Institute for 
Health and Care Excellence (NICE)16  and the Interna-
tional Expert Committee17 suggested using a higher 
cut point of 42-47 mmol/mol (6.0-6.4%) for prediabe-
tes. It is unclear whether the raised HbA1c for defining 
prediabetes is useful for predicting future cardiovas-
cular disease.
Considering these inconsistencies, we performed a 
meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies from gen-
eral populations to evaluate associations between dif-
ferent definitions of prediabetes and the risk of 
composite cardiovascular events, coronary heart dis-
ease, stroke, and all cause mortality.
Methods
search strategy and selection criteria
Following recommendations of the Meta-analysis of 
Observational Studies in Epidemiology group,18 we 
searched electronic databases (PubMed, Embase, and 
Google Scholar) for prospective cohort studies up to 31 
July 2016 using a combined MeSH heading and text 
search strategy with the following terms: “blood glu-
cose”, “hyperglycaemia”, “impaired fasting glucose”, 
“impaired glucose intolerance”, “prediabetes”, “predi-
abetic state”, “borderline diabetes” , “higher risk of dia-
betes”, “high risk of diabetes”, “hemoglobin A1c” or 
“HbA1c” and “cardiovascular disease”, “cardiovascular 
event”, “cardiocerebrovascular disease”, “cerebrovas-
cular disease”, “cerebrovascular disorder”, “cerebro-
vascular attack”, “stroke”, “cerebral infarction”, 
“coronary artery disease”, “coronary heart disease”, 
“ischemic heart disease”, “myocardial infarction”, 
“mortality”, or “death” and “risk”. We also manually 
checked reference lists to identify other potential stud-
ies and restricted the search to human studies. Appen-
dix 1 shows the detailed methods used for searching all 
the databases.
Studies were included for analysis if they were pro-
spective cohort studies with blood glucose and other 
cardiovascular risk factors measured at baseline; all 
participants were aged ≥18; and they provided adjusted 
relative risks and 95% confidence intervals for compos-
ite cardiovascular events (combination of coronary 
heart disease, stroke, or other type of cardiovascular 
disease together), coronary heart disease, stroke, and 
all cause mortality associated with prediabetes com-
pared with normoglycaemia.
Prediabetes was defined as impaired fasting glucose 
according to WHO criteria (IFG-WHO: 6.1-6.9 mmol/L)2  or 
the ADA definition (IFG-ADA: 5.6-6.9 mmol/L),3  impaired 
glucose tolerance (2 hour plasma glucose 7
.8-11.0 mmol/L 
during an oral glucose tolerance test),2 or raised HbA1c 
according to ADA criteria (HbA1c-ADA: 39-47 mmol/mol)3 
or NICE (HbA1c-NICE: 42-47 mmol/mol).16
We excluded studies if enrolment was dependent on 
patients having a particular condition (such as a history 
of cardiovascular disease) or other cardiovascular risk 
factors (such as hypertension, chronic kidney disease) 
and risks for associated events were unadjusted. If mul-
tiple articles were derived from the same cohort and 
reported the same associated events, we included only 
the latest published data for our primary analysis.
As it has been reported that the potential pathologi-
cal mechanisms and cardiovascular risk factors are dif-
ferent in those with impaired fasting glucose, impaired 
glucose tolerance, and raised HbA1c,19 20 we further 
excluded studies if they reported only data associated 
with combined impaired fasting glucose or impaired 
glucose tolerance or combined with either impaired 
fasting glucose or raised HbA1c, but not isolated 
impaired fasting glucose, impaired glucose tolerance, 
and HbA1c categories. Because the rate of progression to 
diabetes is higher in people who have both impaired 
fasting glucose and impaired glucose tolerance,21 
 
however, we included people with both as a separate 
category for analysis to explore whether they are at 
higher risk of cardiovascular disease than those with 
isolated impaired fasting glucose or isolated impaired 
glucose tolerance.
Patient involvement
Patients were not involved in setting the research ques-
tion, in the outcome measures, in the design, or in the 
implementation of the study. No patients were asked to 
advice on interpretation or writing up of results. There 
are no plans to disseminate the results of the research to 
study participants or the relevant patient community.
Data extraction and quality assessment
Two reviewers (YulH and XC) independently screened 
the titles and abstracts of the reports, and full copies of 
potentially suitable studies were obtained. Study infor-
mation such as ethnicity, participant number, age, sex, 
follow-up duration, adjusted risk factors, and events 
assessment was recorded on pretested standard forms.
We used Newcastle-Ottawa quality assessment scale 
for quality assessment of cohort studies,22  in which a 
study is judged based on selection (four items, one star 
each), comparability (one item, up to two stars), and 
exposure/outcome (three items, one star each). In this 
meta-analysis we graded quality as good (≥7 stars), fair 
(4-6 stars), and poor (<4 stars).23 24 We also evaluated 
whether the studies had adequately adjusted for poten-
tial confounders (at least five of six confounders includ-
ing sex, age, hypertension or blood pressure or 
antihypertensive treatment, body mass index (BMI) or 
other measure of overweight/obesity, cholesterol, and 
smoking).
statistical analysis
Primary outcomes were relative risks for composite car-
diovascular events and all cause mortality. Secondary 
outcomes were relative risks for coronary heart disease 
and stroke in individuals by using different definitions 
of prediabetes compared with normoglycaemia.

Subgroup analyses of primary outcomes were con-
ducted according to sex (men v women), ethnicity 
(Asian v non-Asian), age (average <55 v ≥55), possibility 
of enrolling patients with diabetes (yes v no), duration 
of follow-up (<10 v ≥10 years), exclusion of individuals 
with baseline cardiovascular disease (yes v no), and 
study quality (adequate adjustment v inadequate 
adjustment). For composite cardiovascular events, we 
also performed subgroup analysis according to end-
point (incidence v mortality). We used χ2 to test for sub-
group differences—that is, whether the observed 
differences in the subgroups are compatible with 
chance alone. A low P value (or a large χ2 statistic rela-
tive to its degree of freedom) provides evidence of het-
erogeneity beyond chance.25
For meta-analysis we used data on the adjusted out-
come in every included study. We logarithmically trans-
formed these data and calculated corresponding 
standard errors. An inverse variance approach was 
used to combine the log relative risk and SE. In cases 
where the odds ratio was described, we converted data 
to a relative risk for meta-analysis (RR=OR/([1−
pRef]+[pRef×OR]), where pRef is the prevalence of the 
outcome in the reference group.26
Heterogeneity among studies was assessed with the 
Q statistic. PQ statistic ≥0.10 was considered to indicate no 
significant heterogeneity among the included studies. 
Even when a lack of heterogeneity was indicated, how-
ever, we report the results from the DerSimonian and 
Laird random effects models over the fixed effects 
model because the included studies differed to some 
extent, both clinically and methodologically (for exam-
ple, baseline characteristics of the participants, fol-
low-up duration, and adjustment of confounders). If no 
heterogeneity exits in the pooled data, results of ran-
dom and fixed effects models are the same, and if signif-
icant heterogeneity is present, a random effects model 
is more conservative.27 To further confirm the results, 
we have presented the results with both fixed/random 
effects models in the forest plots.
We evaluated publication bias by inspecting funnel 
plots for each outcome in which the natural log relative 
risk was plotted against the SE and further tested with 
Egger’s and Begg’s tests. To assess the effect of individ-
ual studies on the estimated relative risk, we conducted 
a sensitivity analysis in which we recalculated the 
pooled relative risk by omitting one study at a time. 
Analyses were performed with RevMan 5.3 (Cochrane 
Collaboration, Copenhagen, Denmark) and Stata 12.0 
(StataCorp LP, College Station, TX).
Results
studies retrieved and characteristics
Our initial search returned 26 568 articles. After we 
screened titles and abstracts, 216 articles qualified for a 
full review (fig 1 ). We finally included 53 prospective 
cohort studies,8-12 28-75 comprising 1 611 339 individuals 
for analysis. For the association between prediabetes 
and risk of all cause mortality, composite cardiovascu-
lar disease, coronary heart disease, and stroke, 25, 35, 
24, and 18 studies, respectively, provided data.
Table A in appendix 2 provides the key characteristics 
of the included studies. All were derived from the gen-
eral population. Nine studies enrolled only men, and all 
others included both men and women. The duration of 
follow-up ranged from two to 20 years, with a median 
duration of 9.5 years. According to quality assessment 
criteria, 45 studies were graded as good quality and 
eight as fair (table B in appendix 2). Furthermore, based 
on adjusted confounders, 33 studies met our criteria for 
adequate adjustment, while 20 studies did not ade-
quately adjust for potential confounders (table C in 
appendix 2).
All studies excluded people with fasting plasma glu-
cose concentration ≥7.0 mmol/L, except for one that 
only measured 2 hour plasma glucose concentration 
during an oral glucose tolerance test at baseline,28 
with the possibility that a few patients with fasting 
plasma glucose ≥7.0 mmol/L were enrolled in the 
impaired glucose tolerance groups. Twenty eight stud-
ies measured fasting plasma glucose only at baseline 
without an oral glucose tolerance test; these studies 
therefore possibly enrolled patients with 2 hour 
plasma glucose ≥11.1 mmol/L.
Prediabetes and all cause mortality
Twenty five studies reported data for the association 
between prediabetes and risk of all cause mortality. 
Random effects models analyses show that prediabetes 
was associated with an increased risk of all cause mor-
tality: IFG-ADA (relative risk 1.13, 95% confidence 
 
interval 1.02 to 1.25), IFG-WHO (1.13, 1.05 to 1.21), 
impaired glucose tolerance (1.32, 1.23 to 1.40). Prediabe-
tes was not associated with an increased risk of all 
cause mortality when it was defined as HbA1c 39-47 
mmol/mol (0.97
, 0.88 to 1.07) or HbA1c 42-47 mmol/mol 
(1.21, 0.95 to 1.56) (fig 2 ). Data from a single

study showed that prediabetes defined as IFG-ADA and 
impaired glucose tolerance was not associated with 
increased risk of all caused mortality (1.03, 0.75 to 
1.42).48 No studies reported the risk of all cause mortal-
ity in patients with both IFG-WHO and impaired glucose 
tolerance. The increased risk of all cause mortality was 
significantly higher in the impaired glucose tolerance 
group than in groups according to other definitions of 
prediabetes (P<0.001).
Prediabetes and composite cardiovascular events
Thirty five studies reported data for the association 
between prediabetes and risk of composite cardiovas-
cular disease. Table D in appendix 2 provides detailed 
definitions of composite cardiovascular disease in every 
included study. Random effects models analyses 
showed that prediabetes was associated with increased 
composite cardiovascular events when it was defined as 
IFG-ADA (relative risk 1.13, 95% confidence interval 1.05 
to 1.21), IFG-WHO (1.26, 1.12 to 1.41), impaired glucose 
tolerance (1.30, 1.19 to 1.42), HbA1c 38.8-46.4 mmol/mol 
(1.21, 1.01 to 1.44), or HbA1c 42.11-46.4 mmol/mol (1.25, 
1.01 to 1.55) (fig 3). The difference in risk of cardiovascu-
lar disease with different definitions of prediabetes was 
not significant (P=0.16). No studies reported the risk of 
composite cardiovascular events in patients with both 
impaired plasma glucose (either IFG-ADA or IFG-WHO) 
and impaired glucose tolerance.
Prediabetes and risk of coronary heart disease
Twenty four studies reported data for the association 
between prediabetes and risk of coronary heart disease. 
Similar to results for composite cardiovascular events, 
prediabetes was associated with increased risk of 
 
coronary heart disease when it was defined as IFG-ADA 
(relative risk 1.10, 95% confidence interval 1.04 to 1.16), 
IFG-WHO (1.18, 1.08 to 1.28), impaired glucose tolerance 
(1.20, 1.0 to 1.44), HbA1c 39-47 mmol/mol (1.15, 1.01 to 
1.33), or HbA1c 42-47 mmol/mol (1.28, 1.03 to 1.59) (fig 4). 
Combined data from two studies, however, did not 
show an increased risk of coronary heart disease in peo-
ple with both IFG-ADA and impaired glucose tolerance 
(0.93, 0.70 to 1.25). No studies reported the risk of coro-
nary heart disease in people with both IFG-WHO and 
impaired glucose tolerance. There was no significant 
different in risk of coronary heart disease with different 
definition of prediabetes (P=0.36).
Prediabetes and risk of stroke
Eighteen studies reported data for the association 
between prediabetes and risk of stroke. Combined data 
showed that IFG-ADA (relative risk 1.06, 95% confidence 
interval 1.01 to 1.11), IFG-WHO (1.17, 1.09 to 1.25), or 
impaired glucose tolerance (1.20, 1.0 to 1.45) were asso-
ciated with an increased risk of stroke after multivariate 
adjustment. The risk of stroke, however, was not signif-
icant in studies that defined prediabetes as raised 
HbA1c, either according to the ADA (1.05, 0.81 to 1.35) or 
NICE recommendation (1.33, 0.89 to 1.99) (fig 5). No 
studies reported data the risk of stroke with prediabetes 
defined as combined impaired fasting glucose (either

IFG-ADA or IFG-WHO) and impaired glucose tolerance. 
There was no significant different for increased risk of 
stroke in different definition of prediabetes (P=0.64).
sensitivity analyses and subgroup analyses
We found no evidence of publication bias based on 
visual inspection of funnel plots (appendix 3) or accord-
ing to Begg’s or Egger’s tests (all P>0.1). Sensitivity anal-
yses confirmed that the association between endpoint 
events and the different definitions of prediabetes did 
not change with the use of random effects models or 
fixed effects models for the meta-analysis. Furthermore, 
considering smoking is the strongest confounder for 
cardiovascular disease, we further performed a sensi-
tivity analysis on primary outcomes with data with 
adjustment for smoking. We found that after controlling 
for smoking, the presence of prediabetes remained 
associated with an increased risk of composite cardio-
vascular disease when it was defined as IFG-ADA, IFG-
WHO, impaired glucose tolerance, or HbA1c 39-47 
mmol/mol or 42-47 mmol/mol (fig A in appendix 4). The 
risk of all cause mortality associated with IFG-ADA was 
not significant under random effects models analysis 
(relative risk 1.09, 95% confidence interval 0.97 to 1.22), 
though it did reach significance when we used fixed 
effects models (1.08, 1.0 to 1.17). Furthermore, IFG-WHO 
or impaired glucose tolerance was still associated with 
an increased risk of all cause mortality after we 
excluded data from studies that did not adjust for smok-
ing (fig B in appendix 4).
Tables E and F in appendix 2 show the results of sub-
group analyses for the risk of all cause mortality and 
composite cardiovascular events associated with predi-
abetes defined as IFG-ADA, IFG-WHO, or impaired 
 
glucose tolerance. Briefly, we found no significant het-
erogeneity among all subgroup comparisons for predi-
abetes defined as IFG-WHO or impaired glucose 
tolerance (all P≥0.05). IFG-ADA, however, was signifi-
cantly associated with all cause mortality in partici-
pants with a mean age <55 at study entry, but not in 
those aged ≥55 (P=0.009 for interaction). This was the 
only significant heterogeneity we observed among all 
subgroup comparisons in our study. We did not perform 
subgroup analyses for participants with other defini-
tions of prediabetes because of the limited number of 
studies.
discussion
Principal findings
In this meta-analysis with a large sample size (compris-
ing 1 611 339 individuals), we found that prediabetes 
defined as impaired fasting glucose or impaired glucose 
tolerance was associated with an increased risk of com-
posite cardiovascular events, coronary heart disease, 
stroke, and all cause mortality. Importantly, we 
observed increased risks when fasting plasma glucose 
was as low as 5.6 mmol/L according to the current ADA 
definition of impaired fasting glucose (IFG-ADA).3 We 
also found that the risks for composite cardiovascular 
events and coronary heart disease were higher in peo-
ple with prediabetes defined as raised HbA1c of 39-47 
mmol/mol (according to ADA criteria)3  or 42-47 mmol/
mol (according to NICE),16 respectively.
strengths and limitations of study
An important strength of our study is the large sample 
size. We included only prospective cohort studies with 
adjusted relative risks from general populations. There 
were, however, some limitations. Firstly, though indi-
viduals with prediabetes are more likely to progress to 
diabetes than those with normoglycaemia, most of the 
included studies did not adjust for the future develop-
ment of diabetes during the follow-up period. There-
fore, it is still unclear whether the long term health risk 
associated with prediabetes is because of a mild 
increase of blood glucose concentration or because of 
future progression to diabetes. Nevertheless, the results 
indicate that, on the basis of a “snapshot”  
measurement

of blood glucose, prediabetes is associated with an 
increased risk of cardiovascular disease as well as all 
cause mortality, and early lifestyle interventions should 
be implemented in these populations. Secondly, almost 
half of the included studies measured fasting plasma 
glucose only at baseline, without performing an oral 
glucose tolerance test; therefore, these studies possibly 
enrolled patients with increased 2 hour plasma glucose. 
The risk of cardiovascular events and all cause mortal-
ity associated with impaired fasting glucose could be 
confounded by the undetected increase in 2 hour 
plasma glucose (diabetes defined by 2 hour plasma glu-
cose). We found no significant heterogeneity, however, 
in subgroup comparisons conducted according to the 
possibility of enrolling patients with diabetes. Thirdly, 
we found that the risk of composite cardiovascular 
events and coronary heart disease was higher in people 
with mild raised HbA1c (39-47 mmol/mol or 42-47 mmol/
mol), though the risk of stroke did not reach signifi-
cance. These inconsistent results should be interpreted 
with caution because of the small numbers of studies 
included in these analyses. More prospective cohort 
studies that evaluate the level of HbA1c and health risk 
are needed. Fourthly, there were too few studies to draw 
a solid conclusions for the risk of cardiovascular dis-
ease in people with both impaired fasting glucose and 
impaired glucose tolerance.
Comparison with other studies
Several previous meta-analyses have returned inconsis-
tent results on the different definitions of prediabetes 
and target organ damage. In 2014, our group reported 
that prediabetes, defined as IFG-WHO, impaired glu-
cose tolerance, but not IFG-ADA, was associated with 
increased risk of all cause and cardiovascular mortal-
ity.76  Similarly, another published meta-analysis that 
included 15 prospective cohort studies (including 
760 925 participants) reported that the risk of stroke 
increased in people with IFG-WHO or impaired glucose 
tolerance but not in people with IFG-ADA.14 In the past 
few years, however, an increasing number of studies 
have reported on the association between health risks 
and IFG-ADA. We updated our data and found differ-
ences with our previous analysis, with the risks for all 
cause mortality, composite cardiovascular disease, cor-
onary heart disease, and stroke all significantly 
increased in people with IFG-ADA.
Ford and colleagues included 18 studies with 175 152 
participants in their analysis and found that impaired 
fasting glucose (defined with either ADA or WHO crite-
ria) and impaired glucose tolerance was associated 
with a modest increased risk of cardiovascular dis-
ease.15  Endpoint events in the studies included in that 
meta-analysis, however, were significantly different. 
For example, some had data only for coronary heart dis-
ease,37 
44 
45  while others reported the risk of composite 
cardiovascular disease.8 35 77  It is suggested that com-
bining data with different events in a meta-analysis 
could produce misleading results. Contrary to the anal-
ysis conducted by Ford and colleagues,15 the large sam-
ple size in our study (53 prospective cohort studies 
comprising 1 611 339 participants) allowed us to analyse 
the risk of composite cardiovascular disease, coronary 
heart disease, and stroke separately. The strict inclu-
sion criteria in our study were important to avoid het-
erogeneity among studies and lead to a reliable 
conclusion. Furthermore, Ford and colleagues did not 
analyse the risk of cardiovascular disease with predia-
betes defined with HbA1c criteria.15
Future research
Our findings strongly support the lower cut-off point 
for impaired fasting glucose proposed by the 2003 
ADA guideline, and they have important public health 
implications. According to the 2003 ADA definition, 
the prevalence of prediabetes in adults was up to 
36.2% in the US78  and 50.1% in China.79  Considering 
the high prevalence of prediabetes, successful inter-
vention in these large populations could have major 
impacts on public health. The ADA suggests that life-
style intervention is the fundamental management 
approach for prediabetes.80  For people with impaired 
glucose tolerance, lifestyle interventions can reduce 
the risk of progression to diabetes.81  Recently, Yates 
and colleagues reported that in patients with 
impaired glucose tolerance, a change in daily ambu-
latory activity can significantly decrease the risk of 
cardiovascular events.82  Similarly, the Da Qing diabe-
tes prevention study also reported that lifestyle inter-
vention in people with impaired glucose tolerance 
can reduce the incidence of cardiovascular and all 
cause mortality.83 It should be noted, however, that all 
these studies were performed on people with impaired 
glucose tolerance. There are few data in terms of 
interventions for prediabetes defined by impaired 
fasting glucose and HbA1c. Considering the different 
underlying pathophysiological mechanisms84 85  and 
associated cardiovascular risk factors19 20 between 
impaired fasting glucose, impaired glucose tolerance, 
and raised HbA1c, future studies are urgently needed 
to explore effective interventions to decrease the risk 
of cardiovascular disease in people with prediabetes 
defined as impaired fasting glucose and raised HbA1c. 
Furthermore, it should be noted that prediabetes is 
not a disease but rather a risk factor for future diabe-
tes and cardiovascular disease, and the findings in 
our study do not mean that pharmacological treat-
ment is warranted in everyone with prediabetes. Fur-
ther studies are needed to determine which phenotype 
of prediabetes can be benefit from pharmacological 
treatment. Nowadays, the ADA recommended phar-
macological intervention can be considered in indi-
viduals with both impaired glucose tolerance and 
impaired fasting glucose and at least one of age <60, 
BMI ≥35, family history of diabetes mellitus in first 
degree relative, high concentrations of triglycerides, 
reduced concentration of high density lipoprotein 
cholesterol, hypertension, and HbA1c >42 mmol/
mol.80  Furthermore, pharmacological treatment 
should be individualised on the basis of the known 
efficacy and safety of drugs and accompanied by life-
style intervention programmes.85

Interestingly, we found that the risk of all cause 
mortality was significantly higher in the impaired glu-
cose tolerance group than in groups with other defini-
tion of prediabetes. There were, however, no 
significant differences in risks of cardiovascular dis-
ease, coronary heart disease, and stroke with different 
definitions of prediabetes. These results suggest that 
impaired glucose tolerance is a stronger risk factor for 
all cause mortality, but not for cardiovascular disease, 
than other definitions of prediabetes, which might be 
caused by the significant association between 
impaired glucose tolerance and non-cardiovascular 
death, especially cancer mortality.76  It has been 
reported that the risk of cancer mortality is greater 
with impaired glucose tolerance than with impaired 
fasting glucose.46 86
Conclusions and implications
In conclusion, we found that prediabetes defined as 
impaired fasting glucose or impaired glucose tolerance 
is associated with an increased risk of composite car-
diovascular events, coronary heart disease, stroke, and 
all cause mortality. There was an increased risk in peo-
ple with fasting plasma glucose as low as 5.6 mmol/L. 
Additionally, the risk of composite cardiovascular 
events and coronary heart disease increased in people 
with raised HbA1c. These results support the lower cut-
off point for impaired fasting glucose according to ADA 
criteria as well as the incorporation of HbA1c in defining 
prediabetes. At present, lifestyle modification is the 
mainstay management for people with prediabetes. 
High risk subpopulations with prediabetes, especially 
combined with other cardiovascular risk factors, should 
be selected for controlled trials of pharmacological 
treatment.
