BACKGROUND: Little is known about the potentially unfavorable effects of 
mesenchymal stromal cell (MSC) activation on the heart. MSCs can respond 
to tissue injury by anti- or proinflammatory activation. We aimed to study the 
potential negative interaction between left ventricular dysfunction (LVD) and 
MSC activation.
METHODS: We isolated MSCs from cardiac and subcutaneous fat tissues 
of mice with LVD 28 days after myocardial infarction or sham operation. To 
evaluate the effect of LVD on MSCs, we characterized cardiac MSCs and 
subcutaneous MSCs in vitro. Subsequently, we injected MSCs or saline into the 
infarcted myocardium of mice and evaluated LV remodeling and function 28 
days after myocardial infarction. To test the hypothesis that toll-like receptor 
4 (TLR4) mediates proinflammatory polarization of MSCs, we characterized 
cardiac MSCs from TLR4-/- and wild-type (WT) mice after inflammatory 
stimulation in vitro. Next, we transplanted cardiac MSCs from TLR4-/- and WT 
male mice into the infarcted myocardium of female WT mice and evaluated 
infarct size, MSC retention, inflammation, remodeling, and function after 7 days.
RESULTS: LVD switched cardiac MSCs toward an inflammatory phenotype, 
with increased secretion of inflammatory cytokines as well as chemokines. 
The effect of LVD on subcutaneous MSCs was less remarkable. Although 
transplantation of cardiac MSCs and subcutaneous MSCs from LVD and sham 
hearts did not improve LV remodeling and function, cardiac MSCs from LVD 
exacerbated anterior wall thinning 28 days after myocardial infarction. The 
inflammatory polarization of cardiac MSCs by LVD was mediated by TLR4, as 
we found less secretion of inflammatory cytokines and higher secretion of anti-
inflammatory cytokines from activated cardiac MSCs of TLR4-deficient mice, 
compared with WT cardiac MSCs. Significantly, TLR4 deficiency preserved the 
expression of CD47 (don’t eat me signal) on cardiac MSCs after both TLR4 
stimulation in vitro and transplantation into the infarcted heart. Compared with 
WT cardiac MSCs and saline, TLR4 -/- cardiac MSCs survived in the cardiac 
tissue and maintained their reparative properties, reduced infarct size, 
increased scar thickness, and attenuated LV dilatation 7 days after myocardial 
infarction.
CONCLUSIONS: The environment of the failing and infarcted myocardium 
drives resident and transplanted MSCs toward a proinflammatory phenotype and 
restricts their survival and reparative effects in a mechanism mediated by TLR4.

M
esenchymal stromal cells (MSCs), also known as 
mesenchymal stem cells, are resident in almost 
all tissues, including the heart, and play a major 
role in tissue repair and regeneration.1–3 MSCs possess 
immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory properties4,5 and 
have emerged as a viable source for cardiac cell therapy. 
The favorable effects of MSCs on the injured myocardium 
have been extensively studied and are attributed to se-
cretion of immunomodulatory, trophic factors, and che-
mokines.6 Because of their cardiovascular-associated 
features,7,8 cardiac MSCs may represent a more suitable 
cell source for cardiac repair. Little is known, however, 
about the effect of the injured and fibrotic myocardium 
on the function of both resident and transplanted MSCs 
and the potential adverse effects of the transplanted 
cells. MSCs can act as a sensor of myocardial injury 
and inflammation and respond by anti- or proinflamma-
tory activation.4,9,10 Subject to the types of inflammatory 
responses (acute or chronic), MSCs may either suppress 
inflammation and enhance repair of the injured tissue or 
preserve a chronic inflammatory response, leading to fi-
brosis and adverse tissue remodeling.4,11 This outcome 
is important because left ventricular dysfunction (LVD) 
and heart failure are associated with low-grade, local, 
and systemic inflammation,12 able to modulate the func-
tion of resident and transplanted MSCs.
In view of the possible negative interactions be-
tween inflammation and MSCs, we need to determine 
whether and how LVD affects the function of MSCs. 
Understanding the influence of LVD on the function 
of resident and transplanted MSCs is essential to im-
prove the outcome of cell-based therapy. In the pres-
ent study, we aimed to determine the effect of chronic 
LVD on the phenotype and function of resident cardiac 
and peripheral MSCs and to elucidate how the activa-
tion of MSCs affects the development of LVD. We iso-
lated MSCs from mice with chronic LVD after extensive 
myocardial infarction (MI). To test the hypothesis that 
toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) mediates the effects of LVD 
on MSCs, we used cardiac MSCs from TLR4-deficient 
mice. Our results could help to improve the safety and 
efficacy of MSC-based therapy in cardiovascular re-
generative medicine.
METHODS
All animal experiments were complied with the standards 
stated in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals 
(Institute of Laboratory Animal Resources, National Academy 
of Sciences) and were approved by the Sheba Medical Center 
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. To isolate and 
characterize MSCs from LVD or sham mice, we used 11-week-
old, 22 g Balb/C female mice (Harlan). To induce MI for MSC 
transplantation experiments, we used 11-week-old, 22g Balb/C 
female mice (Harlan). To determine the role of TLR4 in cardiac 
MSCs, we used 9-week-old, transgenic TLR4-/- (C57BL/10ScN) 
male mice.13 As a control for the TLR4-/- mice and for the 
isolation of spleen macrophages (MФs), we used 9-week-old 
C57BL/6 male mice (Harlan).
Model of MI, Sham MI, and Cell Transplantation
The model of MI and LVD in the mouse has been previously 
described.3,14,15 In brief, mice (female Balb/C) were anesthe-
tized by inhalation of 2% isoflurane/98% O2. The chest was 
opened by gentle dissection and left thoracotomy by the fourth 
intercostal space. The pericardium was removed to provide 
access to the left ventricular free wall. A 9-0 prolene suture was 
used to ligate the left anterior descending coronary artery at 
the lower border of the left atrium. MI was confirmed by visual 
blanching distal to the occlusion site and by echocardiogra-
phy 24 hours after MI. For sham MI, the suture was passed 
around the coronary artery and removed without ligation. The 
thoracic incisions were closed with 5-0 silk sutures. For cell 
transplantation experiments, we injected the different MSCs 
(105) or saline (20 ul) into the ischemic border zone 1 minute 
after artery occlusion. Mice with LV fractional shortening >40% 
at day 1 after MI were excluded from the study (n=3). In the 
MI/sham MSC study, 38 mice were treated with either cardiac 
MSCs or subcutaneous fat MSCs, which were obtained from 
1 mouse with MI or sham operation and followed up for 28 
days. Perioperative mortality was 58% (52 out of 90). In the 
second study (TLR4-deficient MSC transplantation), 21 mice 
were treated with cardiac MSCs pooled from 3 TLR4-/- or WT 
mice and followed up for 7 days. Perioperative mortality was 
25% (7 out of 28). To assess the survival of MSCs, 7 days after 
transplantation, we injected 105 mCherry-labeled MSCs (20 ul) 
from male C57BL/6 mice into the infarcted heart of female 
Balb/C mice (n=3) immediately after MI.
Echocardiography
To assess LV remodeling and function after cell therapy, we 
performed transthoracic echocardiography with a special 
Clinical Perspective
What Is New?
• Resident and implanted mesenchymal stromal/stem 
cells (MSCs) respond to myocardial injury, inflamma-
tion, and left ventricular dysfunction by proinflamma-
tory activation.
• Proinflammatory MSCs contribute to adverse left 
ventricular remodeling and dysfunction.
• Toll-like receptor-4 deficiency in MSCs attenuates 
their proinflammatory activation and improves their 
reparative properties, graft survival, infarct repair, 
and left ventricular remodeling.
What Are the Clinical Implications?
• Targeting toll-like receptor-4 in MSCs could improve 
the safety and efficacy of cell therapy.
• Our findings could guide the selection of MSC 
source when deciding between autologous versus 
donor MSCs for cell-based therapy in heart failure.

small animal echocardiography system (Vevo 2100 Imaging 
System; VisualSonics) equipped with a 22- to 55-MHz 
linear-array transducer (MS550D MicroScan Transducer). 
Echocardiographic studies were done at day 1 and day 7 or 
28 after MI and MSC transplantation. Light anesthesia was 
induced by inhalation of 2% isoflurane/98% O2 and subse-
quently maintained by 0.5% to 1% isoflurane. We controlled 
the isoflurane flow to maintain the heart rate at >400 bpm 
(mean 428±8 bpm). All measurements were averaged for 
3 consecutive cardiac cycles and performed by an experi-
enced technician who was blinded to the treatment groups. 
Percent of change from first value was calculated for each 
animal as follows: [(follow-up value−first value)/first value] 
×100; ejection fraction = [(LV vol d-LV vol s)/LV vol d] ×100; 
fractional shortening = [(LVDD−LVSD)/LVDD] ×100; frac-
tional area change = [(LVDA−LVSA)/LVDA] ×100.
Isolation of MSCs
To evaluate the effect of LVD on resident MSCs, we isolated the 
cells from the heart and subcutaneous fat (inguinal fat pad) of 
Balb/C female mice 28 days after extensive MI (n=9) or sham 
operation (n=7). To determine the role of TLR4 in cardiac MSC 
polarization, we isolated cells from the hearts of TLR4-/- (n=5) 
and C57BL/6 (WT) (n=4) male mice.
Cells were extracted with an enzymatic digestion mix-
ture as previously described3 using 3 cycles of incubation at 
37°C for 10 minutes. Plastic-adhered cells were incubated at 
37ºC in humid air with 5% CO2 and grown in DMEM (Biological 
Industries) with 15% FBS (Biological Industries), 1% penicillin-
streptomycin (Biological Industries), 1% L-glutathione (Sigma-
Aldrich), 1% MEM nonessential amino acids (Invitrogen), and 
0.1 mM 2-mercaptoethanol (Invitrogen). The medium was 
changed 3 days after plating and subsequently every 3 or 4 
days. In each group of each experiment, we used cultured 
MSCs at passage 3 (from a minimum of 3 mice).
Characterization of MSCs
MSCs were defined according to the 3 criteria of the 
International Society for Cellular Therapy16: (1) adhesion to 
plastic, (2) expression of a specific combination of surface 
markers, and (3) differentiation potential (trilineage differentia-
tion into adipocytes, osteoblasts, and chondrocytes).17
Flow Cytometry
To define the phenotype of MSCs, we analyzed cultured cells 
at passage 3 for common mouse MSC markers by flow cytom-
etry using the following fluorescence antimouse antibodies: 
CD105-APC, CD90-FITC, CD11b-FITC, CD45-FITC, CD31-FITC, 
TER119-FITC, mouse IgG2aκ-APC, IgG2aκ-PE, and IgG2aκ-
FITC (BioLegend).
To determine the effect of TLR4 on CD47 expression in cul-
tured MSCs at passage 3, we analyzed MSCs from TLR4-/- and 
WT mice by flow cytometry using antimouse antibody against 
CD47-PE (BioLegend). MSCs were analyzed with or without 
activation of TLR4 by LPS (10 or 100 ng/mL) for 20 hours. 
Labeled cells (0.5×106) from each sample were acquired 
and analyzed using FACS Calibur Cytofluorimeter (Cyteck 
Development) with Flowjo Software (Tree Star).
Differentiation Assays
To examine the in vitro differentiation potential of the differ-
ent MSCs into osteogenic, adipogenic, and chondrogenic 
lineages, we used specifically formulated cell culture media: 
MesenCult Osteogenic Stimulatory Kit (Mouse), MesenCult 
Adipogenic Stimulatory Supplements (Mouse), and MesenCult-
ACF 
Chondrogenic 
Differentiation 
Medium 
(STEMCELL 
Technologies Inc.). Briefly, for osteogenic and adipogenic 
differentiation, according to the manufacturer’s instructions, 
MSCs were seeded at a concentration of 2.5×104/cm2 in a 
24-well plate and grown for 2 to 3 weeks with osteogenic or 
adipogenic medium changed twice a week. Osteogenic dif-
ferentiation was detected by Alizarin red S staining (0.5% in 
distilled water, pH=4.2), and adipogenesis was detected by 
Oil red O staining (0.3% in isopropanol) (Sigma-Aldrich). For 
chondrogenic differentiation, MSCs were grown in a 3D micro-
mass culture system. At a concentration of 0.5×106/15 mL 
in a polypropylene tube, cells were centrifuged at 300 g for 
5 minutes and then supernatant was removed and cell pellets 
were treated for 14 days with chondrogenic medium changed 
twice a week. Chondrogenic differentiation was detected by 
Alcian blue staining (1% in 0.1 N HCl) (Sigma-Aldrich).
Proliferation Assay
To measure MSC growth rate, we used a cell proliferation 
assay.3 Cells at passage 3 were cultured at 37°C in 96-well 
plates at a concentration of 3000 cells per well. Then we 
measured optical density in triplicate wells for each MSC 
group using a cell proliferation kit XTT-based colorimetric 
assay (Biological Industries) for 4 to 5 consecutive days. 
Each assay was performed on 3 to 4 primary cell cultures 
from each MSC group.
Cytokine Array
To define the levels of cytokine secretion from MSCs, we used 
Q-Plex Mouse Cytokine Inflammation (14-plex) array (Quansys 
Biosciences Multiplex ELISA).3 Briefly, we cultured MSCs for 
72 hours and collected their secreted medium. In the TLR4 
experiment, MSCs were stimulated with an activated-MФ 
medium. For this purpose, we activated spleen MФs (from 
C57BL/6 male mice) with 100 ng/mL LPS (Sigma-Aldrich) 
for 6 hours and then switched to a fresh medium and allowed 
them to secrete growth factors for 24 hours. Then we treated 
the MSCs from both TLR4-/- and WT mice with the activated-
MФ medium. Concentrations of cytokines were determined by 
Quasys Q-View imaging and a software system. For all multi-
plex assays, samples were run in triplicate wells.
Histopathologic Evaluation
At the end of each study (7 or 28 days after cell transplan-
tation), the hearts were perfused with 4% buffered formalin 
(Biolab), harvested, and sectioned into 2 transverse slices 
parallel to the atrioventricular ring. Each slice was embedded 
in paraffin, sectioned into 5-μm slices, and stained with hema-
toxylin and eosin or immunolabeled with specific antibodies.
Postmortem morphometric analysis was performed on 
recipient mice hearts 7 days after TLR4- deficient or WT MSC 
transplantation (8 days after MI). The slides were stained with

Masson’s Trichrome staining and hematoxylin and eosin, pho-
tographed, and analyzed with the use of planimetry software 
(Sigma Scan Pro version 5). We measured the average LV scar 
thickness (from 3 sites of scar), the relative LV scar area (scar 
area divided by muscle area), and the relative LV scar length 
(scar length divided by muscle length) in each heart.
To assess the effect of TLR4-/- cardiac MSCs on MФ accu-
mulation in the infarct site, heart sections (1 per mouse) were 
immunolabeled with rat antimouse F4/80 (AbD Serotec).
Heart sections (from each mouse) were immunolabeled with 
rabbit antimouse CD47/MER6 (Bioss Antibodies). To determine 
the survival of implanted male cardiac MSCs from TLR4-/- or 
WT mouse, we stained the heart sections from female recipi-
ents with antimouse sex-determining region Y protein (E-19) 
(Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) and hematoxylin (for nuclear 
staining).
Statistical Analysis
Statistical analysis was performed with GraphPad Prism ver-
sion 7.00 (GraphPad Software). Variables are expressed as 
mean±SEM. Specific statistical tests are detailed in the figure 
legends. In brief, differences between values were tested by 
unpaired t test or 1-way analysis of variance test (>2 groups). If 
values were not normally distributed (tested by the D’Agostino-
Pearson omnibus normality test), then we used the nonpara-
metric Mann-Whitney test or Kruskal-Wallis test (>2 groups), 
followed by a Dunn multiple comparison posttest. Differences 
in levels of various cytokines were tested by a 2-tailed unpaired 
multiple t test followed by a Holm‒Sidak multiple comparison 
test. We used 2-way repeated-measures analysis of variance 
and a Holm‒Sidak multiple comparison test to assess the sig-
nificance of predefined comparisons at specific time points. 
Differences in the CD47 expression were tested by 2-way anal-
ysis of variance followed by a Holm‒Sidak test.
RESULTS
Characterization of MSCs From the Failing Heart
Chronic heart failure and LVD are associated with low-
grade inflammation.18,19 To determine the effect of LVD 
on resident cardiac MSCs and subcutaneous MSCs, we 
isolated MSCs from female Balb/c mice with LVD 28 
days after extensive MI (n=9) or sham MI (n=7). LVD was 
determined by reduced LV ejection fraction 28 days after 
MI, compared with sham operation (27.9%±3.8 versus 
54.9%±3.8, P<0.0001). We then isolated and cultured 
MSCs from both cardiac and fat tissue after LVD or sham 
operation as previously described.3,14
MSCs were defined according to the 3 criteria of the 
International Society for Cellular Therapy.16 Both cardiac 
MSCs and subcutaneous MSCs, isolated after either MI 
or sham operation, were plastic-adherent and displayed 
a mesenchymal spindle shape (Figure 1A). We next eval-
uated cell proliferation rate for 5 days and found that car-
diac MSCs from the failing hearts had the highest growth 
rate compared with other groups (Figure 1B). Character-
ization of cardiac and subcutaneous MSCs after MI or 
sham by flow cytometry showed that cultured cells from 
the different groups expressed different levels of mouse 
MSC markers, such as CD105, a part of the complex of 
transforming growth factor-β receptor and a marker of 
MSC subset with reparative, myogenic properties.20 All 
were negative for the hematopoietic lineage markers: 
CD11b, CD45, CD31, and TER119 (Figure 1C). Last, tri-
lineage differentiation into osteoblasts, adipocytes, and 
chondrocytes confirmed the identity of the MSCs (Fig-
ure 1D‒F).17 Together our findings indicate that LVD af-
fects the phenotype of MSCs, particularly cardiac MSCs.
LV Dysfunction Modulates MSC Secretome
MSCs modulate infarct repair through their paracrine, 
trophic, immune-modulating, and anti-inflammatory prop-
erties.21,22 Therefore, we aimed to determine the effect 
of LVD on the cytokine profile of MSCs. For that purpose, 
we measured the level of secreted cytokines in the con-
ditioned medium of cultured MSCs. Significantly, cardiac 
MSCs isolated from LVD secreted higher levels (≈1.3 fold) 
of proinflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)-1α, 
IL-1β, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-α, compared with 
their sham counterparts (Figure 2A‒D). The levels of 
the anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-10 and IL-4 remained 
unchanged (Figure 2E and F). It is interesting to note 
that the levels of the MΦ-recruitment factors, regulated 
on activation normal T-cell expressed and secreted, MΦ 
inflammatory protein-1α, and monocyte chemotactic 
protein-1, were significantly increased in cardiac MSCs 
from LVD (2.4-, 3.5-, and 1.6-fold higher) compared with 
sham-isolated cardiac MSCs (Figure 2G‒I). It is notable 
that LVD induced a different secretory profile in subcu-
taneous MSCs (Figure 2). Most cytokines secreted from

analyzed. Measures were analyzed for each marker between the groups by a 1-way ANOVA and a Holm‒Sidak multiple compari-
son test. D through F, Multilineage differentiation capacity of MSCs from the heart and subcutaneous fat of LVD or sham mice

subcutaneous MSCs, such as tumor necrosis factor-α, IL-
10, regulated on activation normal T-cell expressed and 
secreted, MΦ inflammatory protein-1α, and granulocyte 
macrophage colony-stimulating factor, showed either a 
decrease (≈0.6-fold lower) (Figure 2D and E, G and H, 
and J) or no change in cytokine levels, compared with 
their sham counterparts (Figure 2A, B, and F). The secre-
tion of IL-6, which acts as both a proinflammatory and 
reparative cytokine, was higher in both cardiac MSCs 
(1.2-fold) and subcutaneous MSCs (1.3-fold) from LVD 
mice, compared with sham mice (Figure 2C). Overall, 
although LVD switched cardiac MSCs toward a proinflam-
matory phenotype, subcutaneous MSCs were differently 
affected by decreasing secretion of MΦ-recruitment and 
anti-inflammatory factors (Figure 2K).
LVD Reduced the Favorable Effects of Cardiac 
MSCs
We next aimed to determine whether LVD affects the 
reparative properties of MSCs in vivo. For that pur-
pose, we isolated and expanded (3 passages) MSCs 
from cardiac or fat tissue of mice with either LVD or 
sham operation (Figure I in the online-only Data Sup-
plement). Then we injected 105 MSCs or saline (20 
μl) into the ischemic border zone of recipient mice 
immediately after MI as previously described.14 Car-
diac function was evaluated by echocardiography on 
day 1 and 28 days after MI and cell transplantation. 
It is surprising that MSCs from all sources failed to 
improve cardiac function 28 days after MI, compared 
with saline (Table I and Figure II in the online-only 
Data Supplement). However, cardiac MSCs from LVD 
worsened anterior wall thinning, compared with mice 
treated with subcutaneous MSCs from LVD (Table I in 
the online-only Data Supplement). This finding is sig-
nificant because, on the basis of Laplace’s Law, scar 
thinning increases wall stress, subsequent infarct ex-
pansion, and LV remodeling.23 Thus, the inflammatory 
environment after MI restricts the therapeutic benefits 
of transplanted MSCs, and proinflammatory, LVD-de-
rived cardiac MSCs might impair healing and worsen 
myocardial damage.
The Role of TLR4 in Cardiac MSC Polarization
To investigate the mechanism by which the inflamma-
tory environment of LVD restricts the therapeutic benefit 
of cardiac MSCs, we aimed to test the hypothesis that 
TLR4 mediates cardiac MSC proinflammatory polariza-
tion. The rationale for our hypothesis was that TLR4 is 
expressed by MSCs and could mediate the response 
to local inflammatory signals.9,24 Thus, we isolated and 
characterized cells from the hearts of transgenic TLR4-
/- mice (C57BL/10ScN) (n=5) and control WT (C57BL) 
mice (n=4) (Figure 3A). We then evaluated MSC prolif-
eration rate for 4 consecutive days and found a lower 
proliferation rate in cardiac MSCs from TLR4-/- mice, 
compared with WT MSCs (Figure 3B).
To characterize the phenotype of cardiac MSCs, we 
used flow cytometry. No differences occurred between 
TLR4-/- and WT cardiac MSCs in the expression of mouse 
MSC markers (CD105 and CD90) and hematopoietic lin-
eage markers (CD45, TER119, and CD31) (Figure 3C). 
Trilineage differentiation confirmed the identity of MSCs 
from both TLR-/- and WT MSCs (Figure 3D‒F).
It is notable that the secretome analysis of cardiac 
MSCs after inflammatory stimulation revealed that TLR4 
deficiency in cardiac MSCs reduced their proinflamma-
tory phenotype (Figure 4). To mimic the LVD or inflam-
matory environment after MI, we challenged cultured 
cardiac MSCs from TLR4-/- and WT mice with a medium 
of LPS-primed MФs. We then analyzed the secreted cy-
tokines in the conditioned media (Figure 4). It is remark-
able that TLR4 deficiency in cardiac MSCs decreased 
the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-
1α, IL-12, IL-1β, and IL-6 (by 25%, 13%, 8%, and 10%), 
compared with WT cardiac MSCs (Figures 4A‒D). How-

phenotype in response to inflammatory signals, such as 
occur in LVD (Figure 4K).
TLR4 Deficiency in cardiac MSCs Improves Their 
Reparative Properties in Vivo
To further assess the role of MSC -TLR4 in mediating the 
response of MSCs to local signals in the injured heart, we 
injected cardiac MSCs from TLR4-/- or WT male mice into 
the hearts of recipient female mice subjected to acute 
MI. The efficacy of MSC transplantation from gender and 
strain mismatch was confirmed in a separate experiment 
(Figure III in the online-only Data Supplement). We evaluat-
ed cardiac function and remodeling by echocardiography 
at 1 and 7 days after cell transplantation. The rationale 
for a 7-day follow-up was to determine the effect of local 
inflammation on the function of transplanted cells. Signifi-
cantly, TLR4-/- cardiac MSCs were more effective than WT 
MSCs in the prevention of adverse LV dilatation after MI 
(Figure 5 and Table II in the online-only Data Supplement). 
Compared with WT cardiac MSCs and saline, TLR4-/- cardi-
ac MSCs decreased the changes in LV diastolic dimension 
by 2.4- and 2.9-fold, respectively (Figure 5A) and LV dia-
stolic volume by 2.5- and 3-fold, respectively (Figure 5C). 
Thus, deficiency of TLR4 in cardiac MSCs enhanced their 
ability to improve cardiac remodeling after MI.
Postmortem morphometry revealed that scar length 
and area were smaller and scar thickness was greater 
in hearts treated with TLR4-/- cardiac MSCs, compared 
with controls, 7 days after MI (Figure 6A‒F). By mi-
croscopic examination, infarcts treated with WT MSCs 
displayed extensive inflammation at the infarct site (Fig-
ure 6B), whereas the saline-treated group showed a 
thinner, fibrotic scar 7 days after MI (Figure 6C). These 
findings probably reflect an immune response against 
the implanted cardiac MSCs. It is interesting to note that 
a microscopic evaluation revealed islands of karyolitic 
(loss of the nuclei) cardiomyocytes in the infarct zone of 
hearts treated with TLR4-/- cardiac MSCs 7 days after MI. 
These islands were characterized by cardiomyocyte hy-
pereosinophilia and absence of both nuclei and striation 
(Figure 6A). The area of the karyolitic islands in the TLR4-/- 
 
cardiac MSC–treated mice was larger, compared with 
WT MSCs and saline-treated groups (Figure 6G).
In the experiments with TLR4-/- and WT cardiac MSCs, 
we transplanted cells from male donor to female re-
cipient mice hearts. Thus, we were able to assess cell 
retention by staining for the sex-determining region Y 
chromosome (Figure 7A‒C). Indeed, we identified signifi-
cant amounts of donor cells at the site of transplantation 
of TLR4-/- cardiac MSCs around the karyolitic myocardial 
islands 7 days after injection (Figure 7A, parts 1-3). In 
contrast, we identified only a few donor cells in the WT 
cardiac MSC–treated hearts (Figure 7B, parts 1-3).
It is interesting to note that we identified numerous 
macrophages and cells expressing CD47 around the 
karyolitic islands (Figure 7D and E). CD47 is a marker of 
cell viability and communicates antiphagocytic don’t eat 
me signals to MΦs.25–27 To understand the interaction be-
tween TLR4 and CD47, we analyzed cardiac MSCs from 
TLR4-/- and WT by flow cytometry. CD47 expression was 
abundant on both WT and TLR4-/- cardiac MSCs in vitro 
(Figure 7F). However, exposure of cardiac MSCs to 10 
ng/mL of LPS (TLR4 agonist) for 20 hours significantly 
downregulated CD47 expression in WT but not in TLR4-
/- cardiac MSCs (Figure 7F). The minimal LPS dose used 
here mimicked the gradient of danger signals from the 
injury site9 and switched MSCs into a proinflammatory 
phenotype.9 A high dose of the TLR4 agonist (100 ng/
mL) did not affect the expression of CD47 on either WT 
or TLR4-/- cardiac MSCs (Figure 7F) probably because 
of TLR4 downregulation as a negative feedback mecha-
nism.9 Together our findings indicate that TLR4 deficien-
cy in cardiac MSCs preserves the expression of CD47 on 
implanted cardiac MSCs, thus improving the survival of 
implanted MSCs and delaying phagocytosis of ischemic 
cardiomyocytes, which subsequently leads to increased 
scar thickness and attenuation of LV dilatation.
DISCUSSION
Our study suggests that LVD modulates the phenotype 
and function of MSCs from cardiac tissue, and to a lesser 
extent from subcutaneous fat, and attenuates their re-
parative properties. This finding is important because

proinflammatory MSCs can aggravate inflammation and 
myocardial damage, either directly or by influencing the 
immune response.4,6 Transplantation of MSCs from LVD 
or sham into the inflammatory environment after MI did 
not improve cardiac remodeling and function. Moreover, 
proinflammatory cardiac MSCs from LVD exacerbated 
scar thinning after MI. The proinflammatory polarization 
of cardiac MSCs was mediated by TLR4 because TLR4 
deficiency attenuated proinflammatory MSC polarization 
and improved their ability to reduce early cardiac remodel-
ing after MI. Our findings could be relevant to the clinical 
applications of MSC-based therapy and help guide the se-
lection of MSC source when deciding between autologous 
versus donor MSCs for cell-based therapy. To the best of 
our knowledge, our study is the first to show the potential 
negative interaction between cardiac MSCs and the failing 
or infarcted heart and the key role of TLR4 in proinflamma-
tory polarization of MSCs in the setting of LVD.
The retention and survival of MSCs in the heart are 
limited,2,28 and their favorable effects are attributed to 
hit-and-run paracrine effects.6 The favorable effect of 
implanted MSCs on resident cardiac MSCs, MΦs,14 and 
endothelial3 and cardiac stem cells29 is largely paracrine. 
In our study, the improved retention of TLR4-/- cardiac 
MSCs could contribute to improved infarct repair. The 
poor survival of implanted WT MSCs could explain the 
rarity of reported adverse effects in clinical trials. Our 
findings could be significant for the new tissue engineer-
ing approaches to increase cell retention and survival in 
the injured heart, such as injectable biomaterials, scaf-
folds, and microspheres. With greater MSC retention and 
survival, however, we might see more adverse effects.
Our results are in line with the new paradigm of MSC 
polarization.3,9 Waterman et al9 showed that MSCs can 
polarize into 2 functional phenotypes after specific TLR 
stimulation, resulting in different immune modulatory 
Figure 5. Deficiency of TLR4 in implanted cardiac MSCs improves their reparative properties and attenuates LV 
dilatation in recipient mice 7 days after MI. 
To evaluate the impact of TLR4 deficiency on the reparative properties of cardiac MSCs, we injected cardiac MSCs isolated from 
TLR4-/- or WT mice into the hearts of recipient mice subjected to MI and measured their cardiac function. Cardiac MSCs (TLR4-/- 
and WT) or saline were injected into the ischemic zone immediately after MI. Echocardiography studies were done on days 1 and

effects and secretomes in vitro. Although the TLR4-
primed MSCs develop proinflammatory characteristics, 
the TLR3-primed MSCs develop an anti-inflammatory 
profile.
The present work confirms and extends our previous 
work and that of others,3,7,30,31 suggesting that MSCs 
from different tissues have a different phenotype, pro-
liferation rate, and function. The present study and our 
previous work with human MSCs3 suggest that heart dis-
ease affects the phenotype and function of MSCs from 
different tissues.
The Role of TLR4 in MSC Polarization
TLR4 emerged as a potential regulator that could me-
diate MSC proinflammatory polarization. TLRs play a 
critical role in the activation of innate and adaptive immu-
nity32 and trigger inflammation, leading to dysfunctional 
wound healing in several chronic diseases.33 Loss of 
TLR4 provides protection against ischemia/reperfusion 
injury and remodeling after MI.34,35 However, it is unclear 
which cardiac cell is responsible for such protection. It is 
important to note that immune cells as well as a variety 
of other cell types express TLR, including MSCs.3,24,36 
The activation of the TLR4 pathway stimulates secretion 
of proinflammatory mediators by MSCs9,37,38 and can 
modulate their reparative functions.3,9,30,39
In the setting of acute or chronic myocardial injury, 
TLR4 can be activated by endogenous ligands called 
damage-associated molecular patterns.40 These endog-
enous activators, such as heat shock proteins, are de-
rived from dying cells10 and can promote chronic heart 
failure.41
The present study shows that MSCs from TLR4-/- mice 
but not from WT mice improve early LV remodeling af-
ter MI. Moreover, transplanted TLR4-/- cardiac MSCs 
increased scar thickness. This finding is important be-
cause, on the basis of Laplace’s law, increased scar 
thickening reduces wall stress and subsequent infarct 
expansion and LV remodeling.23 Indeed, implanted TLR4-/-
 cardiac MSCs attenuated LV dilatation after MI.
An unusual finding was the presence of islands of 
karyolitic cardiomyocytes surrounded by MΦs in the in-
farcts of mice treated with TLR4-/- cardiac MSCs. MSCs 
regulate MΦ polarization14,42 and inhibit the phagocytic 
capacity of MΦs.42 The inhibitory effect of TLR4-/- cardiac 
MSCs on MΦ phagocytic capacity could partially explain 
the unique finding of karyolitic cardiomyocyte islands. 
It is interesting to note that the cells that encircled the 
islands of karyolitic cardiomyocytes expressed CD47, 
a marker of the don’t eat me signal,43 which prevents 
phagocytosis and is associated with improved myocar-
dial protection and antifibrotic effects on the heart.44 
We have shown that although a low dose of the TLR4 
agonist LPS, which mimics chronic inflammation, down-
regulates CD47 expression in MSCs, TLR4 deficiency 
preserves it. Maintenance of CD47 expression could be 
an advantage to avoid a cleanup response by cardiac 
MΦs.6 It seems that CD47 expression improves implant-
ed MSC survival, delays cardiomyocyte phagocytosis, 
increases scar thickness, and enhances a short-term 
therapeutic effect. Nevertheless, the significance of 
MSC CD47 expression and delayed phagocytosis after 
TLR4-/- MSC therapy needs a longer follow-up period 
because inefficient clearance of dying cardiomyocytes 
has been associated with suboptimal tissue remodeling 
after MI.45
Taken together, our study proposes that TLR4 defi-
ciency in resident and transplanted MSCs could dimin-
ish the negative effects of cardiac inflammation on the 
MSC’s reparative properties, create an improved envi-
ronment for MSC retention, and improve the outcome of 
MSC therapy after MI (Figure 8).
Limitations
First, characteristics of MSCs were based on cultured 
cells. Cell culture duration and the degree of cell ex-
pansion have an impact on MSC phenotype and func-
tional properties.6 Nevertheless, MSCs from different 
sources were cultured under identical conditions, and 
our findings clearly demonstrated the differences in 
characteristics and function between MSCs from LVD 
compared with controls. Second, cardiac MSCs are 
a heterogeneous cell population derived from various 
sources. Thus, the diverse origins for subpopulations of 
cardiac MSCs and the influence on their ability for tissue 
repair warrant further research. Third, to verify similar 
myocardial injury among the experimental groups, we 
performed the first echocardiography study after MI. 
However, a preinjury echocardiography is warranted 
to confirm similar baseline parameters among experi-
mental groups. Fourth, although we used a low level 
of anesthesia, echocardiography in conscious mice 
could avoid the adverse effects of anesthesia and may 
produce more physiological results.46 Last, 7 days of 
follow-up in the experiment of TLR4-/- cardiac MSC trans-
plantation might be too short; the beneficial effects of 
TLR4-/- cardiac MSCs could disappear during a longer 
follow-up period.

Summary, Implications, and Future Research
Our study shows that the environment of the failing and 
infarcted myocardium drives resident and transplanted 
MSCs toward a proinflammatory phenotype and restricts 
their reparative properties in a mechanism mediated by 
TLR4. Further understanding of the molecular mecha-
nisms that govern the interactions between MSCs and 
inflammation is essential for developing new MSC-based 
therapies and improving our knowledge of myocardial in-
flammation and fibrosis. The ability to improve infarct heal-
ing and treat LVD by optimizing MSC therapy could help us 
to advance the field of cardiovascular regenerative medi-
cine, particularly in older and chronically ill patients whose 
MSC regenerative capacity could be impaired.
Figure 8. A proposed model for TLR4-based reeducation of resident and transplanted MSCs by the failing heart 
environment.  
Resident and transplanted MSCs from cardiac patients are affected by local factors released by damaged cells during MI. These 
factors, also called DAMPs, are known to bind to TLR4, which together polarize the MSCs toward a proinflammatory phenotype 
and reduce their CD47 expression (don’t eat me signal), thereby impairing their reparative potential and survival. *Findings from 
previous study. DAMPs indicate damage-associated molecular pattern molecules; LVD, left ventricular dysfunction; MΦ, macro-
phage; MI, myocardial infarction; MSCs, mesenchymal stromal cells; and TLR4, toll-like receptor 4.
