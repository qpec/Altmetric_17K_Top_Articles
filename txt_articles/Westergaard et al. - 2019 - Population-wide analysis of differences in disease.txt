Sex-stratified medicine is a fundamentally important, yet understudied, facet of modern
medical care. A data-driven model for how to systematically analyze population-wide,
longitudinal differences in hospital admissions between men and women is needed. Here, we
demonstrate a systematic analysis of all diseases and disease co-occurrences in the complete
Danish population using the ICD-10 and Global Burden of Disease terminologies. Incidence
rates of single diagnoses are different for men and women in most cases. The age at first
diagnosis is typically lower for men, compared to women. Men and women share many
disease co-occurrences. However, many sex-associated incongruities not linked directly to
anatomical or genomic differences are also found. Analysis of multi-step trajectories uncover
differences in longitudinal patterns, for example concerning injuries and substance abuse,
cancer, and osteoporosis. The results point towards the need for an increased focus on sex-
stratified medicine to elucidate the origins of the socio-economic and ethological differences.

ex- and gender-stratified medicine is an essential aspect of
precision medicine. Sex and gender affect the manifestation
and pathophysiology of many diseases1–3. Sex is defined as
the biological component, while gender is a social construction as
for example defined by the WHO4. Sex is a separate risk factor
even when all other aspects have been taken into account5–7.
Although sex is an important aspect of disease, many sex-specific
analyses focus on one sex only and less on the comparative
aspect8. Consequently, sex- and gender-medicine is generally
understudied, and an increasing body of literature stresses the
need to include both sexes in animal models, clinical trials, and
healthcare planning policies8–12. Men and women are affected
differently by disease, such as cardiovascular diseases, osteo-
porosis, and autoimmune diseases2,3,13–16. Furthermore, many
prior studies also indicate a bias in diagnosis and treatment, for
example that osteoporosis is underdiagnosed in men, while
chronic
obstructive
lung
disease
is
underdiagnosed
in
women16,17. Although earlier studies point to clear sex-specific
differences in a number of disease states, they have not yet been
complemented by multimorbidity studies that incorporate co-
occurrence of other conditions in a systematic manner. Some co-
occurring conditions display a consistent temporal progression
trend. However, cross-sectional studies are time-unresolved and
most cohort studies define a priori the temporal association
between conditions when testing a specific hypothesis, and thus
do not take into account the order in which conditions are
observed in clinical care. Nonetheless, the etiology and outcome
of single conditions will very often be related to their temporal
context in terms of other conditions18–20. A temporal trend is a
prerequisite for causality and should systematically be taken into
consideration when studying patient-specific co-occurrences of
conditions21,22.
Incidence and temporality in diagnosis co-occurrence have
been studied previously, but the focus has not been centered on
sex-stratified differences20,23. We now present a retrospective
cohort study based on the population-wide Danish National
Patient Registry (NPR), where we examine sex-specific incidence,
risk, and temporal aspects of diagnoses and co-occurrence of
diagnosis related to disease and symptoms. Our findings indicate
large discrepancies across all areas of disease.
Results
Diagnosis incidence and relation to age. We analyzed hospital
admissions from 6,909,676 patients (the whole Danish population
during a 21-year period), of which 48.2% were women. We
analyzed the incidence rate of 1369 ICD-10 level 3 diagnoses for
men and women. A complementary analysis using the Global
Burden of Disease (GBD) categories can be found in Supple-
mentary Note 1. Incidence rates may be biased by age; thus we
calculated the age-adjusted incidence rate (AIR) using the Euro-
stat 2013 standard population24. The Methods section contains a
detailed account of the statistical model employed. We found that
344 and 473 diagnoses had a higher AIR in women and men,
respectively (see Supplementary Data 1 for estimates and 95%
Bayesian Credible Intervals (BCI)). Differences in incidence rates
were not limited to a few particular disease areas, but distributed
across the 18 ICD-10 chapters studied (Fig. 1a). Nonetheless,
some ICD-10 chapters such as infectious diseases (ch1), neo-
plasms (ch2), circulatory system diseases (ch9), respiratory dis-
eases (ch10), perinatal conditions (ch16), and injuries (ch19) had
a higher AIR in men, on average. Conversely, endocrine and
metabolic disorders (ch4), eye and adnexa diseases (ch7), skin
diseases (ch12), musculoskeletal diseases (ch13), and congenital
malformations (ch17) had a higher AIR in women, on average. A
very similar pattern was observed when using the GBD categories
(Supplementary Figure 1A). Considering the age of first hospital
diagnosis we found 986 diagnoses in which the age was different
for men or women (Welch’s t test, FDR < 0.05) (see Supple-
mentary Data 2 for mean values and 95% confidence intervals
(CI)). We noticed that in the majority of cases, women were, on
average, diagnosed at an older age than men (Fig. 1b, c). The only
exceptions were neoplasms (ch2), blood and immune system
diseases (ch3), and genitourinary system diseases (ch14). From
the analysis using the GBD categories we also found that men
were, in the majority of the cases, diagnosed at a younger age
compared to women (Supplementary Figure 1B, C).
Diagnosis co-occurrence. Following frequency-based filtering,
we analyzed 27,185 diagnosis co-occurrences, including both sex
and non-sex-specific diagnoses (Fig. 2). In the analysis, we
adjusted for a number of common confounding factors, including
age, admission type, hospitalization month, and year by selecting
a matched comparison group. Modifying disease definitions and
diagnostic criteria may affect both incidence and prevalence25.
Previous studies found that changes in diagnostic criteria
increased the hospitalization rate for e.g. acute myocardial
infarction (AMI), and increased the prevalence and shifted the
age of diagnosis for autism26,27. The criteria for hospitalization
year and month in our scheme negate this type of effect as well as
any seasonal influence, which may change the incidence of, for
instance, infectious diseases. The Methods section contains a
detailed account on the statistical model (see Supplementary
Data 3 for estimates and 95% BCI of relative risks and
directionality).
We found 12,122 directional pairs (defined as diagnosis co-
occurrences that had an elevated relative risk and preferred
statistical direction), when calculating the sex-adjusted RR.
Remarkably, 4155 directional pairs (2055 in men and 2100 in
women) were not common to both men and women. Hence, 4155
directional pairs are driven purely by one sex. This finding could
be a result of a lack of power to detect the direction in either sex,
but an analysis of the number of men and women diagnosed with
the 12,122 pairs showed a high correlation (ρ = 0.861, 95% CI
0.857–0.863, Pearson correlation) (Supplementary Figure 2). For
the 4155 directional pairs only, the correlation coefficient
decreased slightly (ρ = 0.799, 95% CI 0.788−0.81, Pearson
correlation).
We performed a separate analysis of the excluded dagger
−asterisk pairs and found that, overall a dagger code, the etiology,
precedes an asterisk code, the manifestation (Supplementary
Note 2).
When taking sex into account, we found 9547 directional pairs
in men and 10,380 directional pairs in women, respectively. Of
these 6885 were shared leaving 2662 and 3495 unique pairs,
respectively (reduced to 2514 and 2660 when not including sex-
specific diagnoses). We examined the strength in directionality of
the 6885 shared pairs (Supplementary Figure 3). We found that
the variances of the two distributions were not equal, and that the
distribution for women had a larger variance using both the ICD-
10 (F = 0.8269, 95% CI 0.79−0.87, F test) and GBD (F = 0.52,
95% CI 0.42–0.66) terminologies. We noted that the distribution
for women was skewed towards positive values, indicating a
weaker trend in directionality compared to the sex-adjusted
directionality overall. We also found that the majority of
directional pairs included a nonchronic diagnosis, even when
excluding the symptoms and injuries chapter (Supplementary
Table 1).
To obtain an overview of the anatomical and functional
differences between men and women in terms of the directional
pairs identified, we investigated the distribution over the 18 ICD-

 10 chapters. We only included directional pairs identified that
were unique to one sex and at the same time did not include a
sex-specific diagnosis (Fig. 3). We found that diagnosis pairs from
perinatal conditions (ch16) and congenital malformations (ch17)
were preferentially diagnosed first in both men and women, with
the exception of “neoplasms (ch2) and congenital malformations”
in women. Nonetheless, there were also incongruities, such as
“genitourinary system diseases (ch14) and infections (ch1)”, and
“neoplasms (ch2) and digestive system diseases (ch11)”. Using the
GBD terminology we noticed one case in which infectious
diseases (ch1) were diagnosed prior to mental disorders (ch5)
(Supplementary Figure 4). This was, in fact, opposite to what the
analysis using the ICD-10 terminology indicated. In men, the
ICD-10 terminology indicated that skin diseases (ch12) were
diagnosed prior to infectious diseases (ch1), and the opposite was
found using the GBD.
Seven combinations of chapters were found to be unequally
represented, hereof five overrepresented in women (FDR ≤ 0.05,
Fisher’s exact test) (Supplementary Table 2). Diagnoses related to
“neoplasms (ch2) and digestive system diseases (ch11)”, and
diagnoses regarding injuries (ch19) were overrepresented in men.
Diagnoses related to “infectious diseases (ch1) and musculoske-
letal diseases (ch13)”, “neoplasms (ch2) and circulatory system
diseases (ch9)”, “respiratory diseases (ch10) and signs and
symptoms (ch18)”, “musculoskeletal diseases (ch13) and signs
and symptoms (ch18)”, and “musculoskeletal diseases (ch13) and
circulatory system diseases (ch9)” were overrepresented in
women.

 Risk factors, in this case an earlier diagnosis, may predispose
men and women to some diseases unequally. We found 939 pairs
where the relative risk of a future diagnosis was higher in one sex,
compared to the other. We only examined pairs in which more
than five men or women had been diagnosed with the two
diagnoses in the preferred statistical direction. In 517 cases,
women were at a higher risk, while men in 422 cases were at a
higher risk (Supplementary Figure 5A). We identified several
inconsistencies, such as “mental disorders (ch5) and neoplasms
(ch2)”, in which the overall trend for the chapters were in the
opposite order. When we examined the distribution of ICD-10
chapters to which the event, i.e. the diagnosis following the
exposure, belonged, we found nine chapters that were unevenly
represented: endocrine and metabolic disorders (ch4), mental
disorders (ch5), eye and Adnexa diseases (ch7), digestive system
diseases (ch11), skin diseases (ch12), and musculoskeletal diseases
(ch13) in men, while ear and mastoid diseases (ch8), respiratory
diseases (ch10), and genitourinary system diseases (ch14) were
overrepresented in women (FDR ≤ 0.05, Fisher’s exact test)
(Supplementary
Table
3,
Supplementary
Figure
6A).
We
compared 302 of these findings to earlier reports by searching
for mentions of both ICD-10 terms in PubMed and Google
Scholar. Full text articles were inspected for evidence or mentions
of sex-specific risk. In total, we found solid evidence for 42 co-
occurrences in which there had been reported a difference
between men and women (Supplementary Dataset 9). Of these,
33 articles agreed with our findings, five provided only weak
evidence by mentions of sex as a risk factor and no quantitative
estimate or reference. Four articles reported opposite conclusions.
These four articles were based on cohort sizes ranging from 83 to
74,020 individuals. We noticed that the directional pairs with the
largest difference in relative risk from the GBD analysis was
centered on substance abuse and retroviral diseases, and disorders
of psychological development. Additionally, we found that men
with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) were at a
higher risk of lower respiratory infections and other respiratory
disorders (Supplementary Data 7).
Inspecting the median time difference between the first
occurrences, we found that there were 1181 directional pairs in
which the timespan was different in men and women (FDR ≤
0.05, Mann−Whitney U test) (Supplementary Figure 5B). In 851
of these, the time-spans between the two diagnoses were higher in
women, compared to men. Here three chapters were over-
represented: respiratory diseases (ch10) in women, and circula-
tory
system
diseases
(ch9)
and
injuries
(ch19)
in
men
(Supplementary Table 4, Supplementary Figure 6B).
At the extreme, the temporal relationship between exposure
and event (e.g. diagnosis A and diagnosis B) may be reversed for
men and women. This reversal could point to physiological or
etiological differences or may also reflect diagnostic biases within
the healthcare system. For example, our overall analysis indicated
that ischemic heart disease (IHD, I25) precedes paroxysmal
tachycardia (PT, I47). While this pattern holds for men, it is
reversed in women; IHD precedes PT in men, and PT precedes
IHD in women. Thus, men mediate the observed order of
occurrence at a population-wide level (Fig. 4a). We identified 15
pairs using the ICD-10 terminology and one pair using the GBD
terminology in which this reversal occurs, according to our
criteria (Table 1). In ten cases, there were no preferred statistical
direction at the population level, while the sex-specific preferred
statistical direction was reversed. In the remaining five cases, the
overall preferred statistical direction corresponded to the trend in
men. In some cases, the pairs involved a chronic disease and a
complication of this disease. Men were diagnosed with abscess of
anal and rectal regions (K61) followed by Crohn’s disease (K50)
in 56 out of 100 cases, where women were diagnosed in the same
order in 44 out of 100 cases (Fig. 4b). Eight of the reversed pairs
describe conditions related to the bladder and kidney. From the
GBD analysis we identified one relationship in which the order of
diagnosis was reversed, namely “pancreatitis” and “gallbladder

estimate of the relative risk. The standard method for calculating a confidence interval was applied in the prescreening section. Post-filtering 27,185
diagnosis pairs remained comprising 1360 unique diagnoses. Of these, 275 pairs involved a male-specific diagnosis and 1402 a female-specific diagnosis

to “gallbladder and biliary diseases”, whereas the reverse was
found in women. The directionality observed at the population
level corresponded to that in men.
Diagnosis trajectories. Piecing together individual directional
pairs may point towards overseen patterns and sex-related dif-
ferences in a more extended temporal context. One framework
for investing this is diagnosis trajectories19. We investigated the
ten directional pairs (defined as a diagnosis co-occurrence with
increased relative risk and preferred statistical direction) with the
largest difference in relative risk between men and women. We
found 230 linear diagnosis trajectories containing at least four
diagnoses (followed by at least 100 patients) (Table 2). Clustering
the individual trajectories together into one trajectory network
that display one directional pair only once, we noticed that there
were large disparities in diagnoses related to cancers, injuries, and
drug and alcohol abuse (Supplementary Fig. 7). Several diagnoses
related to fractures and injuries lead to or from alcohol abuse-

 related codes, with a higher relative risk in women. Moreover,
women have a higher relative risk of hepatic failure following
esophageal varices (Fig. 5). Second, cancers with well-known sex
differences, such as thyroid cancer, bladder cancer and breast
cancer are apparent (Fig. 6). The trajectory analysis was based on
the most extreme directional pairs only; other diagnosis trajec-
tories will result from including pairs with more moderate effect.
For
instance,
there
is
a
well-known
connection
between
obstructive lung disease and osteoporosis28. Using the disease
trajectory framework, we investigated the disease progression
pattern in men and women (Fig. 7). We observed that obstructive
lung diseases prior to an osteoporosis diagnosis tend to only
occur in men, with the exception of asthma and acute bronchitis.
Moreover, osteoporosis without fracture followed by osteoporosis
with fracture occurred only in women. Upon further inspection,
we observed that this was due to the pair not having a preferred
directionality in men, but that the relative risk was still elevated.
Putting these findings together, we focused on three areas of
disease, in which we highlight specific differences (respiratory
disorders, environmental disorders, and sarcoidosis) (Supple-
mentary Note 3).
Discussion
This analysis identified sex-mediated temporal differences across
nearly all major disease areas. Using data from a complete
population with free and equal access to high-quality healthcare,
we report sex-specific AIR, age of first hospital diagnosis, diag-
nosis co-occurrence, difference in risk, and timespan between

 diagnosis using two complementary terminologies29. We found
that more than half of the ICD-10 diagnoses examined had a
different AIR in men and women, and this percentage was even
higher using the GBD categories. The age at first hospital diag-
nosis was, on average, higher in women, across nearly all areas of
disease. We showed that population-level estimates of the relative
risk, and even directionality, often were driven by a single sex.
Specifically, the jointly observed longitudinal patterns were most
strongly driven by men, and the strength of directionality was
weaker in women, irrespective of the terminology used. There
were many non-sex-specific diagnosis co-occurrences only found
in men or women; these discrepancies were tied to differences in
the relative risk as well as the timespan between two diagnoses.
Using the diagnosis trajectory approach, we illustrate how the
sex-specific statistics can be used in the search for differences in
longitudinal patterns. In three case stories within respiratory
disorders, environmental disorders, and sarcoidosis we high-
lighted how the methods applied in this article provide insight
into gender-specific trends in diseases and disease progression.
Taken together this is, to our knowledge, the most comprehensive
analysis of sex incongruities in a single population presented so
far.
The study used a national patient registry, containing infor-
mation from all private and public hospital admissions in Den-
mark, including all age groups. The population of Denmark is
reasonably homogenous (~11.1% immigrants and descendants in
2015, of which 6.2% are from non-European countries)30. Thus,
we expect that our observations are not confounded by race. Due
to the nature of registry data, there are many latent factors for
which we could not account. We have attempted to eliminate
confounding from age, admission type, changing diagnostic cri-
teria, and seasonal influence. One of the largest limitations of the
study is the quality of data recording, and we cannot rule out that
some of the incongruities could be explained by systematic errors.
Nonetheless, the registry data are used for hospital reimburse-
ment, undergoing yearly compensation adjustments, and thus the
accuracy of most diagnoses is high31. We chose to only investigate
the first occurrence of a diagnosis. It is extremely difficult to
determine when a diagnosis is a recurrence, or just repeated due
to the patient changing wards (or similar). Often, for nonacute
conditions, there are waiting lists at the hospitals. Waiting times
fluctuate over the 20-year period, due to political decisions on
budgets, prioritization of disease areas like cancer, and new
technologies. Hence, we did not include recurrences because it
could potentially introduce bias and spurious findings. Other
limitations regarding true disease state may be due to systematic
gaps in medical evaluation, resulting in under- or overdiagnosis.
This under- or overdiagnosis may result from a variety of causes,
and the interaction between under-, overdiagnosis, and sex is of
general interest, but not something we explored.
We used two different terminologies to examine sex differ-
ences. The ICD-10 terminology reflects the current clinical
practice, and how hospital admissions have been coded since
1994 in Denmark. In a tradeoff between power and specificity, we
worked with ICD-10 at the third level. The GBD categories
represent clinical entities, and sometimes follow different defini-
tions. For instance, in our analysis we would not have identified
the relationship between two of the underlying components of
COPD, emphysema and bronchitis, and osteoporosis had we only
used the GBD terminology. Nonetheless, the GBD categories also
pointed to important findings that could not be identified using
only the ICD-10 terminology, such as alcoholic cardiomyopathy.
Some sex-specific co-occurrences may also be treatment pro-
voked. There is an increasing focus on sex-mediated side effects,
which may be due to physical, hormonal, or even genetic dif-
ferences32,33. This area was not an aspect we could explore further
either due to lack of full access to medication data. In the co-
occurrence analysis, we did not apply prior knowledge to assign
the direction of association, i.e. whether diagnosis A was a risk
factor of B or vice versa, but used advanced statistical models to
infer the most likely order. Many conditions develop asympto-
matically or with diffuse symptoms. Symptoms will often, but not
always, be identified prior to the underlying cause. As a con-
sequence, some conditions are not necessarily discovered in the
order they arise. However, we do not discern whether this relates
to different etiology, differences in presentation of symptoms,
genetics (e.g. the well-known fact that the Y-chromosome
increases the risk for CVD in men34–36), differences in drug
usage (e.g. higher rates of cytochrome P450 CYP3A substrate
metabolism in women32), or biases in the healthcare system (e.g.
frequency of contact). The main goal was to present an overall
view of sex differences, irrespective of mechanistic molecular
causes, links to differences in environmental exposures, or biases
in the healthcare system.
Menopause may also confound the results. This is not a con-
dition that is recorded in the registry, but could be explored by
selecting a fixed age. An earlier study found the average age to be
49 years, but the standard deviation was approximately 1537.
Thus, selecting a fixed age could lead to a big bias, due to the large
spread. This is better explored in another resource where it is
explicitly recorded, e.g. the UK Biobank38. In cases with rare
incidence or co-occurrence of diagnoses it can be difficult to

 obtain a proper estimate of the standard error (SE), leading to
inflated intervals for incidence rates or relative risks. We have
attempted to mitigate this by using a Bayesian Hierarchical Model
(BHM). The BHM improves the estimate of the SE by pooling
information across groups; an approach also used in the GBD and
even clinical trials39,40. An argument against Bayesian statistics is
often that the choice of priors may introduce biases in the esti-
mates. Conversely, here we have chosen informative priors that
center the estimates at no effect, and pool the standard deviation.
Thus, instead of introducing an unwanted bias, we have actually

 made a more conservative estimate compared to traditional
models, which often assume an uninformative prior41. Lastly, we
have disclosed all investigations we have performed in the Sup-
plementary Information and provide a rich set of aggregate data
that can be used in future studies.
We validated a number of the co-occurrences in the existing
literature. The majority of the articles investigating the same
conditions agreed with our findings. Nevertheless, this task is
challenging as no other study is as broad as the one we present.
Many studies do not investigate if there is a difference in sex-
specific risks8. This omission included both meta-analysis,
cohort-, and case-control studies. Sex is an important factor in
epidemiological studies. In studies of single or few diagnoses with
different cohorts, as well as the GBD, it is well documented that
there are sex-mediated differences in the incidence rates3,39. Our
results derived directly from hospital admissions for single disease
incidence align well with previously reported differences, such as
cancer,
musculoskeletal
disorders,
and
autoimmune
dis-
eases15,42,43. We found that the age of first hospital diagnosis was,
on average, nearly always higher in women. To our knowledge,
this has not been systematically studied before, and only reported
for few specific areas, such as cardiovascular disorders44. A
growing body of literature suggests that the reason for the delayed
onset of cardiovascular disorders in women is due to the pro-
tective effect from estrogen44,45. While the age of first hospital
diagnosis should not be confused with the age of onset, there is
growing evidence that the protective role of estrogen is more
widespread than previously thought. For instance, estrogen has
been suggested to be a neuroprotective factor, which is in
agreement with our findings concerning a later age of first hos-
pital diagnosis in women for nervous system disorders46. Sex can
also be a strong confounding factor when estimating diagnosis
co-occurrence. To date no study has yet performed a systematic
investigation of sex-specific diagnosis co-occurrences. We show
how population-wide estimates of co-occurrence can be driven by
a single sex, even when using a matched comparison group to
negate other confounding factors. Furthermore, we demonstrated
that the jointly observed longitudinal patterns are most strongly
driven by men, and that the strength of directionality is weaker in
women. The tendency to report sex-specific estimates is becoming
increasingly standard practice, in particular due to the recognized
fact that sex and gender considerations are vital in precision
medicine47,48.
We found many directional pairs that were unique to one sex.
In this regard, our data demonstrate that disease co-occurrences
related to cancers, digestive disorders, and injuries were over-
represented in men. This result indicates that men are more
burdened by cancers, and complications, in the digestive system.
In a temporal context, we also noticed that men are diagnosed
with digestive system diseases (ch11) prior to neoplasms (ch2).
This points towards a disparity in life-style-related diseases.
Taken together, these findings suggest a bias in clinical practice,
in which men with digestive system disorders are monitored
more closely for neoplasms, whereas women are not. Men suffer
more co-occurring injures. In women, both respiratory and
musculoskeletal disorders were overrepresented in combination
with symptoms and signs (chapter 18). One explanation for this
could be that the prevalence of musculoskeletal disorders is
higher in women, which leads to more unspecific symptoms, such
as
pain.
A
previous
study
found
that
women
report
musculoskeletal-related pain more often, and that this could be
caused by a musculoskeletal sex difference49. In contrast to earlier
large studies pooling data from multiple cohorts, we have been
able to compare the timespan between temporal co-occurrences.
We identified cases in which the temporal pairs had a different
timespan in men and women. We note that in 72% of cases the
diagnosis-free interval is longer for women than men. This
finding aligns well with our earlier finding that the age of first
hospital diagnoses is nearly always greater in women, and clearly
shows how this widespread effect even translates into a temporal
context.
The diagnosis trajectory analysis showed an increased risk in
women between several injuries, substance abuse, and compli-
cations of substance abuse that we speculate could be indicators
of a gender bias reflecting domestic violence and consequences
from drug abuse, in light of an earlier finding that found

 substance abuse to be a risk factor for nonfatal injuries in
women50. The trajectory analysis also demonstrated a temporal
relationship between nontoxic goiter, thyroid cancer, and sec-
ondary cancer in which men were at a higher risk. Women have a
higher incidence of thyroid cancer, and male sex is described as a
risk factor for malignant thyroid nodules. Earlier studies have
found that the aggressive subtypes of thyroid cancer have a
similar incidence in men and women, but that men often present
at a more advanced stage51,52. This observation is an important
finding from both epidemiological studies and this population-
wide analysis and demonstrates the necessity of investigating
multistep temporal associations. Furthermore, the analysis of
obstructive lung disease and osteoporosis trajectories indicated
patterns of severe under diagnosis. First, obstructive lung diseases
were observed as risk factors for osteoporosis only in men. These
results are in contrast to an earlier cross-sectional study, which
found that sex did not modulate the association between airflow
obstruction and osteoporosis53. However, the temporal relative
risk may be more informative than the odds-ratio for the non-
temporal co-occurrence. Moreover, obstructive lung diseases are
underdiagnosed in women, a factor that can affect the estimates
in a cohort study. Secondly, there was no directionality observed
between osteoporosis without fracture and osteoporosis with
fracture in men, but an elevated relative risk in both directions.
Contrary, women were observed to have this pattern. This sug-
gests that osteoporosis in men is not diagnosed prior to fracture,
and therefore not managed. This could be part of the reason why
mortality is higher in men with osteoporotic fracture, compared
to women54. Lowered bone mineral density is a known adverse
effect from corticosteroid therapy, a drug often used in the
treatment of asthma and COPD. Possibly the lack of a connection
for women could be due to the large difference in age of diagnosis
for asthma, and therefore treatment is started later. In the case of
COPD, corticosteroid therapy is only suggested for shorter
symptomatic periods. However, COPD is a substantially under-
diagnosed disease and two studies have estimated that 50–80% of
COPD patients are undiagnosed55,56. Moreover, the COPD
diagnosis is only confirmed by spirometry in 50% of the diag-
nosed patients57,58. Hence, patients receiving a diagnosis of
COPD may be more symptomatically severe and would be
expected to receive a more systemic steroid exposure. Recent data
also suggest that moderate to severe emphysema itself is a risk
factor for osteoporosis59. Another equally valid explanation could
also be that the COPD phenotype carries risk of osteoporosis due
to COPD associated frailty, smoking effects on bone metabolism,
and limitations in physical activity. In addition, there is an
interesting and emerging set of studies showing vitamin D
receptor polymorphisms in patients with COPD and osteo-
porosis60. The relative impact of these factors would be greatest in
men, given the baseline higher (>4 times) level of osteoporosis in
women compared to men by age 50.
Our case story regarding respiratory disorders also highlighted
that some complications, such as bronchiectasis and emphysema,
were different in men and women, a finding that may be relevant
to the clinical assessment and management. Lastly, we found 16
cases where the directionality between two diagnoses was oppo-
site. Some of these point to conditions in which men are not
diagnosed prior to serious complications, such as the case with
Crohn’s disease and abscesses of anal and rectal regions. Other
examples included IHD and PT, and pancreatitis and gallbladder
and biliary diseases. One study found that pancreatitis in men was
typically alcohol induced, while in women it was due to biliary
problems, which could explain the reversed order of diagnosis61.
We speculate that the observed difference between IHD and PT,
in which IHD is a recognized risk factor, could possibly be due to
an under diagnosis of IHD in women. This is further complicated
by the fact that men and women develop different subtypes of
IHD44.
Taken together, our findings strongly suggest many disparities
in a population with a uniform, one-payer-based healthcare,
again underscoring the need for better sex-stratified medicine.
Generally, many of our findings align well with larger meta
studies, such as the GBD. Our study adds the dimension of the
temporal aspect between disorders. In doing so, provide guidance
in the design of future studies while also pointing to potential
gaps in disease surveillance, diagnosis, and management. None-
theless, a clear extension would be to perform this study in other
cohorts, such as the UK Biobank although it is not comparable in
size38. Including resources such as the UK Biobank or the
emerging FinnGen and AllofUs data sets would potentially make
it possible to identify genetic variants that could explain part of
the discrepancy in disease progression.
Methods
Study design and participants. This was a population-based registry study based
on the Danish National Patient Registry (DNPR). The DNPR covered all public
and private hospital admissions in Denmark during 1994–2015, 6,909,676 patients
(ICD-10 period only). The healthcare system in Denmark is universal, meaning
everyone living in Denmark has free access to care. Patients can be tracked through
the healthcare system using the Central Person Registry (CPR) number, which is a
unique identifier assigned to every Danish citizen at birth or immigration (initiated
in 1968). Visits to the general practitioner (GP) and private specialist clinics were
not included in the data set. Admissions included inpatient (patients admitted to
the hospital overnight), outpatient (patients not admitted to the hospital over-
night), and emergency department contacts. Prior to 2002 there were both full-day
inpatients and half-day inpatients. After 2002, the two groups were merged into
one. Hence, we merged full-day inpatient and half-day inpatient from before 2002
into one group, inpatient. Inpatient records cover the time from admission of a
patient to a hospital ward, until discharge to another ward or from the hospital. If a
patient was discharged to another ward, the records were combined into one
record. Likewise, if the patient was re-admitted to the hospital the next day the
records were combined. The data also included open outpatient contacts. If a
patient has regular follow-ups at the hospital the contact may remain open inde-
finitely as an outpatient. Since 2000, the DNPR has been used for reimbursement
and the reimbursement rates are adjusted on an annual basis62. All referral diag-
noses were excluded Referral diagnoses are used when patients are referred to
another ward or department for further investigation based on a suspicion of a
disorder. The ICD-10 is structured hierarchically with four levels. We studied
diagnosis codes at the third ICD-10 level. We excluded ICD-10 diagnoses coming
from chapters 20, 21, 22, as well as all codes specific to the Danish version of ICD-
10. Codes specific for Denmark mainly describe length and weight at birth. We
used the Chronic Condition Indicator to differentiate between acute and chronic
ICD-10 codes (https://www.hcup-us.ahrq.gov/toolssoftware/chronic_icd10/
chronic_icd10.jsp, last visited 13 July 2018). We performed a complementary
analysis using the GBD categories, retrieved from http://ghdx.healthdata.org/
record/global-burden-disease-study-2016-gbd-2016-causes-death-and-nonfatal-
causes-mapped-icd-codes (last accessed 12 June 2018). The corresponding analysis
is described in detail in Supplementary Note 1.
Bayesian inference and model fitting. Posterior distributions are summarized as
a BCI. The BCI is the interval that spans the most credible values of the dis-
tribution, sometimes also referred to as the Highest Density Interval63. We defined
the range of the BCI in this work to be the interval that spans 95% of the posterior
distribution. Unless otherwise specified, the reported effect size is the median of the
posterior distribution. We also defined a Region Of Equivalent Practice (ROPE) for
the quantities of interest. A ROPE is a small region of values considered to be
practically equivalent to a null value63. This is to ensure that the effect size of
interest has a magnitude of clinical relevance, and is not just marginally different
from the null value. All Bayesian models were made using the No-U-Turn sampler,
a Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) variant, implemented in Stan v. 2.17.0, an
open-source probabilistic programming language64,65. Unless otherwise specified,
we ran four HMC chains, with default settings, for a total of 4000 samples, 2000 of
them for warm-up to adapt HMC-specific hyper-parameters. The number of
samples is significantly lower than what is usually drawn using e.g. Gibbs sampling.
This is due to the nature of the NUTS-HMC algorithm, which converges faster65.
We assessed convergence by inspecting the R-hat statistic, tree depth, and number
of divergences66,67. The R-hat statistic describes the variation between chains. If all
chains have arrived at the exact same posterior distribution for the given para-
meter, the R-hat will be 1. The tree depth plot is a method for assessing pathology
in the HMC algorithm. If the tree depth goes to the maximal at every iteration past
warm-up this indicates a random-walk behavior, which can lead to biases in the
parameter estimates. A divergence happens when the model has numerical

 problems (e.g. division by zero, under flowing, or over flowing), and may indicate a
problematic posterior or model that does not fit the data well. In this work, we
conclude that a model has converged if and only if, (1) all R-hat values are below
<1.1, (2) the tree depth is not at the maximal in any of the chains past warm-up, (3)
there are zero divergences.
Diagnosis incidence rates. We examined all diagnoses at the ICD-10 level 3 that
occurred in at least 100 patients during the 21-year period. The cutoff was set to
avoid diagnoses used only very rarely or never. A number of diagnoses can only
occur in one sex. For instance, hyperplasia of prostate can only occur in men. To
identify sex-specific diagnoses we manually curated each diagnosis examined in
this work, and classified whether the diagnoses were sex specific or not (Supple-
mentary Data 8). A trained clinician oversaw and verified the curation. To estimate
the incidence, we fitted a hierarchical Bayesian Poisson model of the form shown in
Eq. (1),
yi � PoissonðexpðηiÞÞ
ð1Þ
in which ηi is a linear combination of the strata for every diagnosis as shown in Eq.
(2),
ηi ¼ βi;0 þ βi;Age � xi;age þ βi;sex � xi;sex þ logðoffsetiÞ
ð2Þ
in which the age is one of the 21 5-year interval groups defined in the European
Standard Population 2013 (Eurostat)24, the sex is a binary indicator, and the offset
is the population at risk. To complete the model, we specify a set of priors on the
coefficients shown in Eqs. (3–5)

ð3Þ
βi;sex � N 0; σsex

in which βage represents a coefficient for each of the 21 age groups, with an
individual prior, σage, on each coefficient. We defined the prior on the scales of the
coefficients as shown in Eqs. (6–8),

in which N+ is the truncated normal distribution. For the coefficients, we choose
weakly informative priors, with the exception of β0. This was due to the large
number of people at risk, i.e. the offset. Therefore, we choose a less informative
prior for the scale. From the fitted model, we simulated the number of cases for
each diagnosis, displayed in Eq. (9),

in which pi is the age-specific rate, and Ni is the population of age group i,

men, and women, using the European Standard Population 2013, age-adjusted
rates are per 100,000. If the relative difference is greater than 0.1, we conclude that
there is a difference in incidence rate. The relative difference is defined in Eq. (12),
d ¼
AAIRmen � AAIRwomen
ðAAIRmen þ AAIRwomenÞ=2 ;
ð12Þ
where a positive number will indicate a higher AIR in men, and a negative
number a lower AIR in women.
Age of first hospital diagnosis. We calculated the average age of diagnosis for a
given ICD-10 code by calculating the mean across all cases in the NPR separately
for men and women. We identified differences using the Welch t test. P values were
adjusted using the stringent Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) procedure. We report the
difference in means. We estimated the chapter-wise difference by calculating the
weighted mean.
Diagnosis co-occurrence. We examined all pairs of diagnosis that occurred in
more than 100 individuals. The cutoff was set to ensure that the combination of
two diagnoses is sufficiently prevalent to be of interest. The time resolution of the
NPR is one day, and any diagnoses given on the same day were not counted. Only
the first occurrence of a diagnosis was considered. The time of diagnosis was taken
as the time the patient was discharged. If the patient had not yet been discharged,
the date of the last diagnosis was used instead. ICD-10 has a dual coding system,
the dagger−asterisk system. The asterisk represents the symptom or manifestation
of disease and the dagger indicates the etiology of the disease. We identified these
pairs and excluded them from subsequent analysis.
To negate the most common confounding factors, we sampled a matched
comparison group. For any given combination of diagnoses, A and B, we fixate A
as the Exposure (Ex) and B as the Event (Ev) to estimate the time-resolved relative
risk, RR (A → B), and directionality, Pr (A → B). For every exposed patient, we
sampled five nonexposed cases matched to (i) be in the same age group, (ii) have a
hospital discharge from the same type of encounter (inpatient, outpatient,
emergency department), (iii) be discharged at the same month of the same year,
±3 months. An earlier study found that the hospital encounter is a confounding
factor in as much as 15% of the identified diagnosis co-occurrences from a study in
the NPR20. Moreover, modifying disease definitions and diagnostic criteria may
affect both incidence and prevalence25. Previous studies using NPR found that
changes in diagnostic criteria increased hospitalization rate for AMI, and increased
the prevalence and shifted the age of diagnosis for autism26,27. We negate this effect
by matching the encounter year. Lastly, by matching the encounter month we
diminish seasonal variation that may influence the incidence of, for instance,
infectious diseases.
The relative risk is not symmetrical, i.e. RR(A → B) ≠ RR(B → A), and thus we
repeat the process of selecting matched controls by fixing B as the exposure, and A
as the event. This effectively doubles the number of combinations of diagnoses
examined.
HMC models are computationally expensive to fit. Consequently, prior to
running the full hierarchical Bayesian model using Stan we applied a prefilter by
calculating the 95% CI of the relative risk using the formula provided by Morris
and Gardner68. The relative risk is given in Eq. (13),
RR ¼ NA!B=ðNA!B þ NAÞ
NB=ðNB þ N0Þ

and the standard error of the log-transformed RR is shown in Eq. (14),

hence the CI of the RR is given in Eq. (15),

:
ð15Þ
We calculated CI separately for men, women, and the two sexes combined.
Only pairs of diagnoses in which either the lower bound of the CI RR(A → B) or RR
(B → A) excluded 1.01 were included in the subsequent analysis, that is we only
studied diagnosis co-occurrences in which the exposure increased the risk of the
subsequent event by more than 1%. We note that we do not perform any correction
for multiple testing. Consequently, the number of false positives will be high.
Additionally, in cases with a low number of patients, the estimate of the standard
error will be inaccurate. However, in the following part we describe a BHM to
refine the estimate of the relative risk.
We refine the estimate of the temporal relative risk and directionality between
pairs of diagnoses by employing a hierarchical Bayesian model. For each exposure,
i, and the event observed together with this exposure, j, we describe the relationship
using a Poisson model following Eq. (16),
yij � PoissonðexpðηijÞÞ;
ð16Þ
where ηij is a linear combination shown in Eq. (17),
ηij ¼ βij;0 þ βij;Ex � xij;Ex þ βij;Ev � xij;Ev þ βij;ExEv � xij;ExEv þ logðoffsetijÞ

in which xEx and xEv are indicator variables for the exposure and event,
respectively. xExEv is the interaction between the exposure and event. The offset is

risks by introducing a sex term and interaction terms between Ex, Ev, and Sex
shown in Eq. (18).

in which N+ is the truncated normal distribution. We have removed confounding
from age, admission type, admission year, and admission month by selecting five
matched patients. Thus, we have not included these terms in the model, as the goal
is to study the effects from sex. The prior values chosen for the interaction terms
favors effects close to zero. Hence, by prior design we expect that only few of the
pairs investigated will occur together more than expected by chance. In addition,
the hierarchical structure imposes shrinkage on the coefficients and helps inform
coefficient estimates across pairs where counts may be low63.
Using the posterior distribution, we estimate the directionality and relative
risks. We simulated the number of patients who had been diagnosed in the order
A → B and B → A, and calculated the probability of observing two diagnoses in a
specific direction using the formula specified in Eq. (33),
Pr A ! B
ð
Þ ¼
NA!B
NA!B þ NB!A
:
ð33Þ
The probability of Pr(A → B) is thus as specified in Eq. (34),
Pr B ! A
ð
Þ ¼ 1 � Pr A ! B
ð
Þ:
ð34Þ
We define a ROPE in the interval (0.49, 0.51). If the BCI excludes these values,
we conclude that the pair of diagnoses has a preferred statistical direction. This
probability can also be interpreted quantitatively. For instance, Pr A ! B
ð
Þ ¼ 0:8
would correspond to A being diagnosed before B in four out of five cases.
Likewise, from the posterior distribution, we calculate an adjusted relative risk
using the Cochran−Mantel−Haenszel method shown in Eq. (35),
RR A ! B

and likewise for women.
In this study, we are not interested in identifying inverse comorbidities, i.e. cases
where an exposure reduces the risk of a later event. Hence, we define a ROPE that
the lower bound of the RR should exclude 1.1. This corresponds to at least a 10%
increase in risk. If a combination of diagnoses has a preferred direction and the RR
lower bound of that direction excludes 1.1, we say that the co-occurrence was a
directional pair.
To compare the relative risk between men and women we subtract the posterior
distribution of RRmen and RRwomen from each other. If the resulting BCI excludes
(−0.1, 0.1), i.e. there should be a difference in risk of at least 10% or more, we note
that there is a significant difference in relative risk between men and women.
To compare the difference in directionality strength, we inspected the median of
the posterior distribution for the joint direction, and subtracted the posterior
distribution of direction men and women, respectively, as shown in Eqs. (37) and
(38).

We tested if there was a difference in the variance of the distribution using the F-
test. This requires that the distributions are normally distributed. We confirmed
this by visual inspection of the density plots (Supplementary Fig. 1). We report the
ratio between variances (men compared to women) as the effect size, and the 95%
CI.
Literature validation and comparison of co-occurrences with a higher risk in
men or women was performed by searching PubMed for articles mentioning either
diseases, or, a more specific relevant term. Articles matching were inspected for
cohort sizes and to identify any sex-specific estimate of risk or mentions of sex as a
risk factor.
Difference in time between diagnosis. The time between two diagnoses is
computed across all patients that have been diagnosed with both diagnoses. We
only look into the directional pairs, defined by an elevated relative risk and pre-
ferred direction. We notice that, due to the long follow-up, the distributions have a
heavy tail, and are thus not normally distributed. Therefore, we used the two-sided
Mann−Whitney U test. Only directional pairs found in both men and women are
investigated. Effect sizes are reported as the median difference in time, and the p
value is corrected for multiple testing using the BH method. A median difference in
time less than zero indicates that the disease transition progress faster in women,
and likewise a median difference in time greater than zero indicate that the pro-
gression is faster in men.
Diagnosis trajectories. We pieced together directional pairs of diagnosis to form
multistep trajectories18,19. For every pairwise co-occurrence, we iteratively added a
diagnosis and counted the number of people following the trajectory in the
population. In this particular study, we only investigated trajectories followed by
more than 100 people, with a minimum of four diagnoses. Using the disease
trajectory framework, we studied two categories of trajectories. First, we investi-
gated the directional pairs that had the biggest difference in relative risk between
men and women. Second, we selected two diseases, obstructive lung diseases and
osteoporosis, which prior studies had found to be underdiagnosed in women and
men, respectively. The trajectories were visualized as networks, in which each node
represents a diagnosis and the connection between two nodes, the edge, represents
a directional link between two diagnoses.
