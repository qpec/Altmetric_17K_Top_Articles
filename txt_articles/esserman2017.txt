IMPORTANCE The frequency of cancers with indolent behavior has increased with screening.
Better tools to identify indolent tumors are needed to avoid overtreatment.
OBJECTIVE To determine if a multigene classifier is associated with indolent behavior of
invasive breast cancers in women followed for 2 decades.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This is a secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial
of tamoxifen vs no systemic therapy, with more than 20-year follow-up. An indolent
threshold (ultralow risk) of the US Food and Drug Administration–cleared MammaPrint
70-gene expression score was established above which no breast cancer deaths occurred
after 15 years in the absence of systemic therapy. Immunohistochemical markers (n = 727
women) and Agilent microarrays, for MammaPrint risk scoring (n = 652 women), were
performed from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded primary tumor blocks. Participants were
postmenopausal women with clinically detected node-negative breast cancers treated with
mastectomy or lumpectomy and radiation enrolled in the Stockholm tamoxifen (STO-3) trial,
1976 to 1990.
EXPOSURES After 2 years of tamoxifen vs no systemic therapy, regardless of hormone
receptor status, patients without relapse who reconsented were further randomized to 3
additional years or none.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Breast cancer–specific survival assessed by Kaplan-Meier
analyses and multivariate Cox proportional hazard modeling, adjusted for treatment, patient
age, year of diagnosis, tumor size, grade, hormone receptors, and ERBB2/HER2 and Ki67
status.
RESULTS In this secondary analysis of node-negative postmenopausal women, conducted in
the era before mammography screening, among the 652 women with MammaPrint scoring
available (median age, 62.8 years of age), 377 (58%) and 275 (42%) were MammaPrint low
and high risk, respectively, while 98 (15%) were ultralow risk. At 20 years, women with
70-gene high and low tumors but not ultralow tumors had a significantly higher risk of
disease-specific death compared with ultralow-risk patients by Cox analysis (hazard ratios,
4.73 [95% CI, 1.38-16.22] and 4.54 [95% CI, 1.40-14.80], respectively). There were no deaths
in the ultralow-risk tamoxifen-treated arm at 15 years, and these patients had a 20-year
disease-specific survival rate of 97%, whereas for untreated patients the survival rate was
94%. Recursive partitioning identified ultralow risk as the most significant predictor of good
outcome. In tumors “not ultralow risk,”tumor size greater than 2 cm was the most predictive
of outcome.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The ultralow-risk threshold of the 70-gene MammaPrint
assay can identify patients whose long-term systemic risk of death from breast cancer after
surgery alone is exceedingly low.

reast cancer is biologically and molecularly heteroge-
neous, exhibiting a spectrum of clinical outcomes rang-
ing from very low risk to very high risk for metastatic
recurrence. Timing of life-threatening recurrence varies, oc-
curring months to decades after diagnosis and primary
therapy.1 Molecular profiling has spawned the development
of signatures that identify tumors associated with early risk
for recurrence2,3 and patients who benefit from systemic che-
motherapy to reduce that metastatic risk.4,5
With the introduction of screening, the distribution of the
biologic subtypes of breast cancer shifted, and overall inci-
dence increased by 10% to 20%. Decades later, this increased
age-adjusted incidence of breast cancer has remained high.6
The bulk of the increase has been in early-stage tumors (stage
0, 1), suggesting that screening contributes disproportion-
ately to the diagnosis of biologically more indolent forms of
breast cancer.7,8 While screening is associated with a relative
mortality reduction of 20%,9,10 it has increased the diagnosis
of low-risk lesions and contributes to overtreatment.6,7,11,12
Scholarly articles reporting the detection of indolent cancers
continue to stir controversy.13 Unfortunately, clinically low-
risk invasive cancers can recur very late, even after 10 or 15
years. Tools with the capacity to identify ultralow-risk tu-
mors at the time of diagnosis could prevent overtreatment.
Cancertype,histologicgrade,proliferativeindex,andstageare
associated with lower early metastatic disease risk but do not
reliablyidentifythosewithsufficientlylowlong-term(20years)
risk of recurrence to avoid or further reduce therapy.
The 70-gene MammaPrint assay (US Food and Drug Ad-
ministration–cleared) was initially developed as a prognostic
tool for women with breast cancer who did not receive adju-
vant systemic therapy. The low- vs high-risk threshold was ini-
tially used to differentiate recurrence at 5 years after diagno-
sis because this predicts benefit of systemic chemotherapy. In
the recently reported 6693-person randomized clinical trial
MINDACT,5 patients with clinically high but molecularly low-
riskdiseasewithoutchemotherapywerefoundtohavea94.7%
distant metastasis–free survival at 5 years, even with up to 3
positive nodes and tumors up to 5 cm in size.
We previously demonstrated that screening has led to an
increase in the proportion of 70-gene low-risk tumors rela-
tive to the era prior to the advent of screening. We had set an
ultralow-risk threshold (where there were no metastatic
events at 5 years, in the original 70-gene cohort) and found
that ultralow-risk disease increased from 10% in an
unscreened population to 30% in a screened population.14
However, hormone-positive cancers can recur decades after
diagnosis, and two-thirds of recurrences are after 5 years. To
truly identify cancers with indolent lesions of epithelial ori-
gin behavior (extremely low risk for systemic recurrence), we
set a threshold where there were no breast cancer deaths for
node-negative patients at 15 years, using 25-year follow-up of
the NKI295 series,1,15 and this was confirmed in the original
European validation set for the 70-gene assay3 (eFigure 1 and
eReference in the Supplement).16
Toindependentlyandrigorouslyvalidatethenewultralow-
risk threshold, we used a unique resource, the Stockholm ran-
domized clinical trial, STO-3, of postmenopausal women with
clinically detected node-negative tumors 3 cm or smaller as-
signed to tamoxifen vs no adjuvant therapy, which had tissue
blocks available and meticulous follow-up.17,18
Methods
Study Population
The STO-3 study group conducted a randomized clinical trial
of tamoxifen from 1976 until 1990 in postmenopausal
women.17 The STO-3 low-risk trial included 1780 lymph node-
negative patients with tumors smaller than or equal to 3 cm
in diameter, randomized to 2 years of adjuvant tamoxifen (40
mg daily) vs no adjuvant treatment. In 1983, patients who re-
consented and were recurrence-free after 2 years of tamoxi-
fen treatment were randomized to 3 additional years of ta-
moxifen or no further therapy. The STO-3 trial was approved
by the ethical committee at Karolinska Institutet, and partici-
pants provided oral consent. Ethics approval was also ob-
tained for the secondary analysis presented in this study. .
There were 808 patients with formalin-fixed paraffin-
embedded (FFPE) tissue blocks available for molecular analy-
sis,with81patientsexcludedbecauseofaninsufficientamount
of invasive tumor tissue.18 The patient subset with available
FFPE material was well balanced relative to the original co-
hort with regards to tumor characteristics (tumor size, estro-
gen receptor status and treatment arm assignment).19 Immu-
nohistochemical analysis (estrogen receptor, progesterone
receptor, ERBB2/HER2, and Ki67) was performed on 727 speci-
mens at a single laboratory. RNA was extracted, and 652 pa-
tients had 70-gene signature classification passing the qual-
ity check (Figure 1): 339 had received tamoxifen, and 313 had
not received adjuvant systemic therapy.

Key Points
Question Can a molecular signature—an ultralow-risk threshold of
the US Food and Drug Administration–cleared MammaPrint
70-gene expression score—be used to identify tumors with
indolent behavior?
Findings In this secondary analysis of a trial of node-negative
postmenopausal women randomized to tamoxifen vs no systemic
therapy that included 652 patients with MammaPrint risk scoring,
15% met the ultralow-risk threshold. Ultralow-risk patients have a
20-year disease-specific survival rates of 97% and 94% in the
tamoxifen arm and control arm, respectively.
Meaning The ultralow-risk threshold can identify patients whose
long-term risk of dying from breast cancer is exceedingly low.

EnVision plus detection, following standard recommended
procedures.
70-Gene Prognosis and 80-Gene Subtype Assignments
MammaPrint and BluePrint assays were performed according
to standard protocols and have been previously de-
scribed.20,21 These tests are based on microarray gene expres-
sion analysis of RNA extracted from FFPE breast tumor tissue
and use custom-designed array chips manufactured by Agi-
lent Technologies. The Agilent oligonucleotide microarray
platform assesses the messenger RNA expression of the
70-gene MammaPrint or 80-gene BluePrint subtype signa-
tures, 465 normalization genes, and more than 250 probes
for hybridization and printing quality control. Seventy-gene
signature tumors were classified into risk categories as either
ultralow (≥0.355), low but not ultra-low (>0, <0.355),
and high risk (<0) using thresholds previously developed.15
BluePrint subtype assigns to luminal, basal, or
ERBB2/HER2-type.21
PAM50 Intrinsic Subtype Assignment
In addition to Blueprint subtype assignment, tumors were as-
signedto1of5intrinsicsubtypes(luminalA,luminalB,ERBB2/
HER2, basal, normal-like) using the PAM50 classifier as
described in Parker et al22 and eMethods in the Supplement.
Statistical Analysis
Kaplan-Meier analysis of 20-year breast cancer–specific sur-
vival by MammaPrint risk categories (high- vs low-risk) was
performed, and significance assessed using the log-rank
test. Similarly, Kaplan-Meier analysis of 20-year breast cancer–
specific survival according to 70-gene risk categories were
conducted for all patients, as well as within each STO-3 trial
treatment arm (tamoxifen or untreated) separately. In addi-
tion, analyses of 20-year breast cancer–specific survival by the
ultralow-risk threshold, used as the reference category, were
performed by multivariate Cox proportional hazard model-
ing adjusting for age and year of breast cancer diagnosis, es-
trogenreceptor,progesteronereceptor,ERBB2/HER2,Ki67,tu-
mor grade, tumor size, and STO-3 trial treatment arm
(tamoxifen or untreated).
Recursivepartitioningwasperformedusingtherpartpack-
age in R software (R Foundation) to construct a survival tree
that best predicts 20-year breast cancer–specific survival. In-
put variables to the model includes 70-gene risk categories,
BluePrint intrinsic subtype, age and year of breast cancer
diagnosis, estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, ERBB2/
HER2, and Ki67 status, tumor grade (1, 2, or 3), tumor size, and
treatment arm. The final tree was selected by minimizing the
10-fold cross validation error.
Survival outcomes of patients in this cohort were fol-
lowed through December 31, 2012. The 20-year, breast cancer–
specific survival analysis is presented owing to concerns for
model stability stemming from the small number of patients
still alive and at risk within the ultralow-risk group after 20
years. Patients with contralateral primary breast cancers were
censored at the time that the contralateral cancer was diag-
nosed to avoid confusion about ascribing breast cancer mor-
tality to the contralateral cancer rather than the initial cancer
event. Altogether, 61 patients with contralateral cancers (29
were tamoxifen treated [8.6%], 32 were untreated [10.2%])
were censored for the survival analysis.
All data preparation and analysis were done using SAS
statistical software (version 9.4; SAS Institute Inc) and R,
version 3.1.2.
Results
Patient and tumor characteristics of the postmenopausal
women with available microarray data and within each treat-
ment arm (n = 652) are in the eTable in the Supplement. No
significant differences in age, type of surgery received, recep-
tor status, tumor grade, and size were observed between the
treatment arms. Most patients (516 [79%]) received mastec-
tomy and axillary dissection. Of the tumors reassessed for es-
trogenreceptor,progesteronereceptor,ERBB2/HER2,andKi67
status, 538 (83%) were estrogen receptor–positive; 369 (58%)
were progesterone receptor–positive; 53 (8%) were ERBB2/
HER2-positive, and 178 (29%) had Ki67 greater than or equal
to 15%; 121 (19%), 375 (58%), and 147 (23%) were grade 1, 2, and
3, respectively; and 499 patients (78%) had tumor size smaller
than 2 cm and were not different from the original cohort
(n = 1780).23
Long-term Survival Analyses of Cause-Specific Breast Cancer
The 70-gene signature scored 42% of patients as high-risk and
58% as low-risk. Kaplan-Meier breast cancer survival graphs
of high- and low-risk patients censored at contralateral breast
cancer diagnosis are shown in Figure 2A. There is a statisti-

 lent (>95%) breast cancer–specific survival at 5 years. How-
ever, with extended follow-up, patients continue to die from
their disease.
Survival curves (Figure 2B) are shown for the 652 pa-
tients based on ultralow-, low but not ultralow, and high-risk
assignments, 15% (98) of which were ultralow-risk. The dif-
ference in outcome based on the 3 designations is significant
with a log rank P < .001. When stratified by treatment, in pa-
tients who received tamoxifen, there were no breast cancer–
specific deaths at 15 years and breast cancer–specific survival
was 97% at 20 years (Figure 2C); patients without any sys-
temic therapy had a 97% and 94% breast cancer–specific sur-
vival at 10 and 20 years, respectively (Figure 2D). Results with-
out censoring for second cancers are shown in eFigure 2 in the
Supplement.
Multivariate proportional hazards analyses of 20-year
breast cancer–specific survival according to 70-gene risk
groups adjusting for age and year of primary breast cancer
diagnosis, estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, ERBB2/
HER2, and Ki67 status, tumor grade, and tumor size,
and treatment arm was performed. After adjustment,
patients with high-risk and low-risk assignments had a
statistically significant increased long-term risk of 4.73
(95% CI, 1.38-16.22) and 4.54 (95% CI, 1.40-14.80) of breast
cancer–specific death, respectively, compared with patients
with MammaPrint ultralow tumors.
Characteristics of MammaPrint Ultralow-Risk Tumors
Figure 3A shows the intrinsic and biological characteristics
of tumors that meet the MammaPrint ultralow-risk thresh-
old. All ultralow tumors were hormone receptor–positive
ERBB2/HER2-negative and of the luminal subtype by
BluePrint. Using a 15% cutoff for Ki67 “low,” 96% of
ultralow-risk tumors with known Ki67 assessments were
Ki67-low. When the PAM50 algorithm was used to assign
intrinsic subtype, 89% of ultralow-risk tumors were desig-
nated as luminal A. Interestingly, only 19% of hormone
receptor–positive ERBB2/HER2-negative tumors and 20% of
Ki67-low tumors are ultralow risk (Figure 3B). Similarly,
only 25% and 26% of tumors characterized as luminal A by
PAM50, and Blueprint, respectively, meet the ultralow-risk
threshold. On review of pathologic features of the ultralow-
risk tumors, invasive ductal (no special type) carcinomas
were the most frequent, but lobular, tubular, invasive papil-
lary, and invasive cribriform subtypes were enriched, and
mucinous types were absent.

 Recursive Partitioning
We used rpart, a recursive partitioning tool, with cross-
validationtointegratemolecularandclinicalvariablesandcon-
struct a survival tree that best predicts 20-year breast cancer–
specific survival. The resulting model (Figure 4A) first divides
patients by the ultralow-risk classification. No further subdi-
vision of ultralow-risk patients is observed. In contrast, for tu-
mors that do not meet the ultralow-risk classification, size is
selectedasthenextmostpredictivefactor,wherepatientswith
tumors greater than 2 cm have the worst outcome, with
only about 70% breast cancer-specific survival at 10 years
(Figure 4B).
Discussion
The ultralow-risk threshold of the 70-gene signature, in post-
menopausal women with node-negative tumors 3 cm or
smaller, reliably identifies women with minimal risk of death
from breast cancer out to 20 years in the absence of any sys-
temic therapy and negligible risk of death with 2 or more years
of tamoxifen therapy alone. The ultralow-risk tumors are hor-
mone-positive, mostly luminal A with low proliferation
(Ki67 < 15%); however, they are only a small subset of can-
cers with those characteristics.
How is this relevant today? Women who have a tumor that
is an ultralow-risk tumor by 70-gene signature can be reas-
sured that their long-term outcome is expected to be excel-
lent, with or without endocrine therapy. In the tamoxifen-
treated arm, most had only 2 years of therapy and still had
excellent long-term survival. Many women are unable to tol-
erate 5 years of endocrine therapy, and fewer than 60% com-
plete 5 years of treatment.24 With the updated American So-
ciety of Clinical Oncology guidelines of 10 years of adjuvant
endocrine therapy for patients with hormone receptor–
positive breast cancers,25 a test that accurately identifies a
population of women who have very little risk to begin with
should be welcomed by patients and clinicians alike. Impor-
tantly, this data set allowed us to evaluate the outcome of
women with surgical therapy alone, and no systemic therapy,
demonstrating an extremely low risk of recurrence. Further-
more, elderly women (>75 years) with comorbidities and a life
expectancy of less than 10 years who present with an ultralow-
risk breast tumor can be offered excision alone, with confi-
dence that the treatment will be sufficient.
In the STO-3 randomized clinical trial, all women re-
ceived either mastectomy or lumpectomy and radiation, so
there is no direct evidence to support reducing local therapy.
However, the ultralow-risk tumors were a subset of luminal A
tumors, and there is evidence that postmenopausal women
with luminal A tumors have only a 5% chance of local recur-
rence with or without radiation.26 Other randomized clinical
trials also document similar groups of women who do not ben-
efitfromradiation,26-28andwherethesmallfractionofwomen
who recur can be successfully treated at the time of recur-
rence. However, despite level 1 evidence in 3 trials, the use of
radiation for these subtypes has changed very little. The ul-
tralow-risk classification, a smaller, more restricted subset of
the Ki67 < 15% and luminal A cases, should surely qualify
for “no radiation.” The indolent behavior of these tumors and
lack of systemic risk over 2 decades support a less aggressive
approach to treatment.
Almost all women in the STO-3 randomized clinical trial
presented with palpable primary tumors, since breast can-
cer screening was not initiated in the Stockholm health care
region until 1989. Importantly, 15% of these symptomatic
(clinically detected) tumors were ultralow, showing that
these tumors are an inherent part of the spectrum of breast
cancers detected, regardless of screening. Women with
ultralow-risk tumors who did not receive adjuvant therapy
had excellent survival (94%), with the rare recurrence
appearing 10 to 20 years after diagnosis. The group that had
2 or more years of tamoxifen had a 3% chance of death from
breast cancer at 20 years. It is therefore unlikely that early
detection of these types of lesions, before they come to
clinical attention, would result in further clinical benefit.
Even in the absence of screening, there are breast cancers
that pose little or no systemic risk. The opportunity now is
to recognize and properly classify these indolent tumors to
avoid overtreatment.
The frequency of ultralow-risk cancers in a screened popu-
lationofpostmenopausalwomenislikelyintherangeof25%.29
In the United States, over a 10-year period, 2 million cancers
will be diagnosed, of which 500 000 might be indolent. Tools

 such as the ultralow-risk threshold of the 70-gene test can en-
able these tumors to be classified at diagnosis and provide re-
assurance that, once removed, the condition is rarely associ-
ated with distant recurrence or death (Figure 4C). This will
providesupportforpatientsandtheirphysicianstochooseless
aggressive therapy.
The overall objective of screening is to identify breast can-
cers at an earlier stage and thereby reduce the mortality that
is associated with more clinically advanced disease. Mitigat-
ing the harms of screening30,31 requires both the recognition
that ultralow risk tumors exist, and the ability to reliably iden-
tify them with a diagnostic tool. Recursive partitioning
(Figure 4A) demonstrates that the ultralow-risk classification
is the most predictive factor at 20 years of follow-up.8 Inter-
estingly, once the ultralow-risk tumors are removed from the
population, the next most predictive factor that drives prog-
nosis is tumor size greater than 2 cm, suggesting that early de-
tection is important for those tumors that are not ultralow risk
(although some of this risk will be addressed with other sys-
temic treatments not available at the time this study was con-
ducted). The ability to identify an ultralow-risk category of tu-
mors represents another critical advance in how molecular
tools enable care to be personalized.1,4,32-36
Since the outcome of tumors with indolent behavior is ex-
cellent, even when detected as a palpable mass, detection of
their precursors would not deliver benefit. These data pro-
vide the impetus to explore whether we can identify the types
of ductal carcinoma in situ that precede indolent lesions and
refine our targets for screening. We are also investigating the
genes that characterize ultralow-risk lesions and will explore
commonalities across cancers that originate in other organ
sites.37 In prostate cancer screening, Gleason 3 + 3 is a marker
of indolent disease. Men treated with active surveillance have
now been shown to have excellent outcomes without exci-
sion, with 10-year disease-free survival rates of 97%.38 Com-
mon biologic features of indolent behavior could inform a
change in nomenclature.
Interestingly, tamoxifen reduces the risk of contralateral
cancers, but not until 15 years, possibly reflecting the long term
preventive benefit of tamoxifen.
Limitations
Limitations of this study include the fact that we did not ad-
dress whether breast cancer–specific survival was signifi-
cantly affected by any additional endocrine therapy given
at the time of first recurrence. Also, all women had either

on outcomes with less aggressive local therapy. The STO-3 trial
population is racially homogeneous; however, this should not
affectourfindingsbecauseaggressivebehaviorassociatedwith
AfricanandAfricanAmericanraceisexplainedbyahigherpre-
ponderance of high-risk basal genotypes.39 Finally, there were
98 patients in the ultralow-risk group. However, with only 15%
of patients classified as ultralow risk, a very large trial would
be needed to have a larger number of patients with ultralow
tumors. The long follow-up, however, is unique and enables
studies in Sweden, with their detailed and complete regis-
tries, to address questions for which long follow-up is essen-
tial. Their cancer registries are a model for the field.
Conclusions
We have used a molecular classifier to demonstrate long-
term indolent tumor behavior. Such tools, if integrated into
screening, treatment, and trials, can prevent inadvertent
overtreatment and enable excellent outcomes with less toxic
effects.
