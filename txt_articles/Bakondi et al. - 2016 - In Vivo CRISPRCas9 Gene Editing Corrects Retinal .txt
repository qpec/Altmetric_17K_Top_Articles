Reliable genome editing via Clustered Regularly Inter-
spaced Short Palindromic Repeat (CRISPR)/Cas9 may 
provide a means to correct inherited diseases in patients. 
As proof of principle, we show that CRISPR/Cas9 can be 
used in vivo to selectively ablate the rhodopsin gene car-
rying the dominant S334ter mutation (RhoS334) in rats 
that model severe autosomal dominant retinitis pigmen-
tosa. A single subretinal injection of guide RNA/Cas9 
plasmid in combination with electroporation generated 
allele-specific disruption of RhoS334, which prevented reti-
nal degeneration and improved visual function.

INTRODUCTION
Gene replacement strategies in clinical trials for retinal degenera-
tive diseases were designed to compensate for the biallelic inheri-
tance of recessive, loss-of-function mutations.1 This approach, 
however, is inapplicable to autosomal dominant retinitis pigmen-
tosa (adRP) in which disease penetrance is conferred by a mono-
allelic, gain-of-function mutation.2 Twenty-four genes have been 
implicated in adRP etiology, with Rho variations constituting the 
highest proportion of RP cases.3 Studies in transgenic animals 
bearing dominant Rho mutations showed that disease severity 
can be mitigated by silencing the mutant RNA transcript4,5 or via 
transcriptional suppression using an allele-independent approach 
to target both mutant and wild-type genes.6 The caveat to these 
approaches, however, is the requisite supplementation with the 
wild-type Rho (RhoWT) transcript.
Allele-specific genomic ablation using Clustered Regularly 
Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeat (CRISPR)/Cas9 may pres-
ent a simplified therapeutic strategy in which retinal function is 
restored by the remaining RhoWT allele in adRP patients. Though 
two RhoWT alleles will remain following transgene ablation in the 
model used here, patient hemizygosity does not manifest in haplo-
insufficiency as RhoWT expression between 50 and 200% is clinically 
asymptomatic.2 Moreover, as little as 10% of total Rho expression 
from a control transgene was shown to be sufficient to reconstitute 
the WT phenotype in Rho knockout mice.7 Accordingly, adRP may 
be amenable to allele-specific ablation therapy without requiring 
exogenous RhoWT supplementation.
Transgenic S334ter rats that possess the mouse genomic frag-
ment containing RhoS334 show phenotypic similarity to human 
class-I RHO mistrafficking mutations, exhibiting continual photo-
receptor (PR) loss and commensurate vision decline.8 The S334ter 
mutation generates a serine substitution at amino acid position 
334/338 for a stop codon resulting in early termination (“ter”), and 
RHO truncation by 15 C-terminal residues.3 The resultant peptide 
(RHOS334) lacks three serines required for PR deactivation following 
light stimulation,9 and part of the signal sequence required for RHO 
trafficking to photoreceptor outer segments (POS).10 The morpho-
logical development of POS is critical to support phototransduc-
tion11 and is absent in line-3 S334ter rats (S334ter-3).12 As RHO 
constitutes ~85% of the total protein content in PRs, its retention 
in processing organelles at the cell body instigates PR toxicity and 
is compounded by constitutive PR activity, resulting in apoptosis.13
We hypothesized that the selective ablation of RhoS334 in vivo 
would eliminate the RHOS334 production and toxicity and allow 
native RhoWT to restore the phenotype to that of the nondystro-
phic retina. We used CRISPR/Cas9 to selectively disrupt RhoS334 
by utilizing the requirement of Cas9 activity on the recognition 
of a protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) present in RhoS334, which 
diverges from the RhoWT sequence by one nucleotide (5′-TGG-3′ 
versus 5′-TGC-3′, respectively). Here, we show that this single 
base pair difference facilitated discrimination between Rho alleles 
during Cas9 cleavage, which permitted the unabated function of 
RhoWT to prevent RP pathology and loss of visual acuity.
RESULTS
Differential distribution of RHOS334 versus RHOWT in 
S334ter-3 rats
S334ter-3 rats are characterized by the rapid and progres-
sive loss of PRs in the outer nuclear layer (ONL) beginning at 
postnatal day (P) 11, until complete degeneration is reached 
by P28, at which time just a single row of PR nuclei remain.12 
Similarly, S334ter-3 rat retinas showed near full ONL thickness

at P14 (Supplementary Figure S1a, bracketed areas), compared 
with a single discontinuous row of remaining PR nuclei at P33 
(Supplementary Figure S1c, bracketed areas). As previously 
described for line-4 S334 rats, RHO N-terminal immunolabel 
identified both the truncated (RHOS334) and full-length (RHOWT) 
isoforms. However, RHO C-terminal-specific immunolabel 
exclusively identified the RHOWT isoform.14 Immunolabeled 
N-terminal RHO in P14 S334ter-3 retinas was predominantly 
mislocalized at PR cell bodies throughout the ONL, while 
RHOWT was present in the ONL and polarized toward PR inner 
segments (Supplementary Figure S1a versus S1b). The conse-
quence of RHO mistrafficking by P33 was the degeneration of 
PRs in the ONL, which consisted of a single discontinuous layer 
of PR nuclei (Supplementary Figure S1c,d).

Guide RNA vector design and strategy
We designed a 20 nucleotide targeting-guide RNA (gRNA) con-
struct (gRNATRGT) complementary to a region in exon 1 imme-
diately upstream of a PAM unique to the RhoS334 locus in order 
to discriminate alleles during Cas9 cleavage (Figure 1a,b). The 
homology between mutant and WT Rho alleles at the gRNA bind-
ing locus differs by one nucleotide at position 10/20 (Figure 
1b). 
gRNATRGT targeted the second of four PAMs identified as unique to 
RhoS334 to give the greatest probability for allele-specific ablation. 
We reasoned that 3′ open reading frame disruptions downstream 
to the two PAMs in exon 4 risked generating further truncated 
RHO isoforms, while targeting the 5′-most PAM of exon 1 risked 
RhoS334 open reading frame restoration as a consequence of poly-
merase skipping. While the S334ter mutation was not the target of 
our gRNATRGT, dominant adRP mutations have been identified in 
patients that generated novel PAM sequences15 that may be targe-
table similar to the current strategy (Supplementary Table S1).
RhoS334 disruption in vitro
RhoS334-selective cleavage with gRNATRGT was confirmed 
in cultured bone marrow-derived stromal cells derived from 
S334ter-3 rats (MSCsS334). mCherry+ MSCsS334 were isolated 
by  
fluorescence-activated cell sorting 3 days after transfection 
(Figure 
1c,d), and PCR-amplified regions of genomic DNA that 
encompassed the predicted Cas9 cleavage sites were sequenced. 
Multiple peaks and decreased nucleotide read fidelity (Phred 
quality scores) indicated the presence of novel genomic 
sequences originating downstream from the disparate PAM 
of RhoS334, which was absent at the homologous RhoWT locus 
(Figure 1e,f). Genomic disruption was not observed using a 
second gRNA that targeted exon 2 of RhoS334, which had four 
nucleotide mismatches from RhoWT, and was thus used as a con-
trol gRNA (gRNACNTRL) for in vivo experiments (Figure 1g). 
Likewise, genomic disruption was not observed in cells from 
untreated retinas (Figure 
1h).

RhoS334 disruption in vivo
To evaluate RhoS334 disruption in vivo, S334ter-3 rats received a 
single unilateral subretinal injection of the gRNATRGT construct at 
P0 (Figure 
2a), immediately followed by electroporation in order 
to facilitate plasmid uptake by PRs in cell cycle.16 Retinas were dis-
sociated at P4 and plasmid-transfected cells were sorted on the 
basis of mCherry expression (Figure 
2b,c), followed by genomic 
DNA extraction for Sanger sequencing. We confirmed multiple 
genomic sequences resulting from RhoS334-selective cleavage 
downstream the Cas9 cleavage site (blue highlight) in P4 mCherry+ 
PRs (Figure 
2d), but no cleavage was detected at the RhoWT locus 
(Figure 
1e). Genomic cleavage was similar in PRs that expressed 
mCherry at high (mCherryHi) or intermediate/low (mCherryLo) 
levels in three rats (Supplementary Figure S2). PCR-amplified 
genomic DNA regions encompassing the gRNATRGT target site 
were further sequenced after clonal expansion in NEB-α to deter-
mine indel frequency. The ratio of clones in which indels were 
detected from two rats represented cleavage efficiencies of 33% 
(7/21 clones) and 36% (15/42 clones). Indels were not detected at 
the RhoWT locus or the next 8 motif-mismatch-predicted off-target 
loci (Supplementary Table S2). Similarly, histological evaluation 
using cresyl violet stain showed phenotypic rescue by gRNATRGT 
treatment compared with the contralateral untreated eye of the 
same animal (Supplementary Figure S3a,c versus S3b,d).
PR preservation following RhoS334 ablation
To determine whether the retinal phenotype was altered in 
S334ter-3 rats, gRNATRGT and gRNACNTRL treatments were assessed 
by immunohistology at P33. Extensive and robust retinal preser-
vation was observed in gRNATRGT-injected eyes with up to eight 
layers of rescued PRs, in sharp contrast to the single PR layer in 
gRNACNTRL-treated retinas (Figure 
3a–c versus 3d,e). PR rescue 
was observed exclusively in transfected regions demonstrated 
by coincident mCherry expression, which were the only regions 
with observable POS formation, morphologically characteris-
tic of the WT phenotype that was absent in gRNACNTRL-injected 
eyes (Figure 
3d,e). Furthermore, N-terminal RHO labeling con-
firmed the absence of RHOS334 from PR cell bodies in the rescued 
ONL (Figure 
3b), while C-terminal labeling showed RHOWT to 
be strictly confined to POS (Figure 
3c). These data suggest that 
RhoS334 was ablated and the toxic effect of RHOS334 was removed in 
transfected regions, which subsequently permitted proper RHOWT 
trafficking, POS formation, and PR survival. gRNACNTRL-treated 
retinas lacked appreciable amounts of either RHO isoform at P33 
due to extensive degeneration (Figure 
3d,e).
Retinal synapse preservation following RhoS334 
ablation
Immunostaining of degenerated gRNACNTRL-treated retinas revealed 
that the single layer of remaining PRs were  
non-Rho-expressing 
cone cells (Figure 
4a,d), the morphology of which was well pre-
served with gRNATRGT treatment (Figure 4e,h). mCherry fluo-
rescence intensity in PRs appeared highest in  
mitochondria-rich 
inner segments (Figure 4g). In addition, gRNATRGT treatment 
preserved the dendritic arborization of  
rod-bipolar cells (protein 
kinase C-α, Figure 
4i) and synaptic density between second-order

Quantification of PR density and visual function in 
RhoS334-treated retinas
The extent of mCherry distribution in retinal flat-mounts at P33 
reached 29% maximal area coverage, with uneven fluorescence 
intensity in transfected regions (Figure 5a). By cross-section 
analysis, the density of PRs in mCherry+ regions from gRNATRGT 
treatment at P33 was 307 ± 82 PR nuclei/100 μm or ninefold 
greater than from gRNACNTRL treatment (33 ± 3 nuclei/100 μm, 
P ≤ 0.01) and was similarly higher when compared with com-
parable regions (nonfluorescent) of untreated control (27 ± 13 
nuclei/100 
μm, P 
≤ 
0.01). The density of PR nuclei was not different 
between gRNACNTRL and untreated groups (P 
= 
0.41) (Figure 
5b). 
Visual acuity assessed at P39 by optokinetic response was 53% 
higher from gRNATRGT compared with that of gRNACNTRL treat-
ment (0.185 versus 0.121 cycles/degree, respectively; Figure 
5c). 
By using the contralateral eye of individual animals as internal 
controls, visual acuity was 35% higher in the gRNATRGT-treated 
eye compared with the fellow eye in individual animals, whereas, 
gRNACNTRL-injection reduced visual acuity by 2.3% compared to 
the contralateral untreated eye (Figure 
5d).
DISCUSSION
These data collectively provide proof of principle for in vivo 
 
allele-specific ablation using CRISPR/Cas9 to prevent inherited 
retinal degeneration. The selective ablation of RhoS334 had pre-
vented RHOS334 accumulation at PR cell bodies in the ONL and 
restored RHOWT trafficking to outer segments, which prevented 
retinal degeneration and preserved visual acuity. Eliminating 
RHOS334 expression generated blunt transition areas at which 
markedly preserved retinal areas adjoined those with advanced 
degeneration. These transition regions likely represent the 
physical extent to which gRNATRGT transfection had reached, as 
mCherry expression shared the same demarcation (Figures 3a 
and Figures 
4i,j ). The observation that mCherry expression was 
not observed in all rescued PRs is likely attributable to the epi-
somal nature of the plasmids and the reduced efficiency of the 
cytomegalovirus promoter (driving mCherry) compared to that 
of Chicken  
β-actin-derivative (driving Cas9).17 Thus, mCherry 
expression likely underestimated the total number of PRs in 
which Cas9/gRNATRGT was active and therefore the number of 
PRs in which the RhoS334 ablation-mediated rescue had occurred.
This assertion is consistent with the S334ter-3 model, in which 
the expression of RhoS334 is exclusive to (rod) PRs and instigates 
cell autonomous apoptotic signaling, suggesting that RhoS334 abla-
tion is the only manner by which phenotypic rescue could have 
been achieved with gRNATRGT treatment. Furthermore, since 
PRs possess a single copy of the RhoS334 transgene, its ablation 
is absolute for conferring PR survivability. Whether this perma-
nent genomic change confers long-term PR survival in a degen-
erative milieu will require sequential analysis of gRNATRGT-treated 
retinas. Toward this goal, PR loss was shown to be halted in an 
inducible transgenic model of autosomal recessive RP, even at 
advanced stages of degeneration.18 Furthermore, a translational 
proof-of-concept study using gene replacement in a canine model 
of X-lined RP demonstrated the feasibility of long-term arrest of 
PR loss.19 These studies support the possibility of long-term vision 
rescue following in vivo gene correction.
With regard to visual function assessment, optomotor reflexes 
were significantly preserved from a single gRNATRGT treatment 39 
days prior, compared with controls. Differences in visual function 
were not detected by electroretinography, however, electroreti-
nography sensitivity is limited for detecting focal retinal activity

and may not represent an appropriate test for our experimental 
approach. Translational limitations of the current methods are 
technical in nature and greater functional improvement may be 
obtained through alternative methods to maximize retinal trans-
fection and genetic correction. For example, the use of shorter 
Cas9 orthologs, such as Staphylococcus aureus (~3.3 kb)20,21 with 
short universal tRNA promoter,22 will allow for efficient vector 
packaging into adeno-associated viral particles. Alternatively, 
direct delivery of Cas9 protein/gRNA complexes in vivo would 
also minimize the duration of endonuclease activity and therefore 
the risk for off-target cleavage events without compromising tar-
geted cleavage efficiency,23 a critical consideration in the context 
of using genomic ablation as therapy.
The first in vivo functional correction of an inherited dominant 
mutation using CRISPR, shown here, provides  
proof-of-concept 
that CRISPR/Cas9 can be used to treat inherited adRP. Selective 
ablation of a dominant allele was achieved by targeting a PAM 
unique to the RhoS334 transgene, which differed from the RhoWT 
sequence by a single nucleotide. adRP-linked missense muta-
tions that likewise create targetable monoallelic PAM sequences 
have been identified in patients (Supplementary Table S1), 
who may thus represent the candidate population for ablation 
therapy to achieve phenotypic rescue. The challenge of generat-
ing targeted therapies for diseases with mutational heterogeneity 
may be addressed by altering the PAM specificity of Cas through 
 
rational-design engineering24 or by using noncanonical Cas 
enzymes.25 Such efforts may broaden the number of targetable 
mutations and, thereby, expand the treatable pool of patients with 
degenerative diseases of the retina, and possibly other tissues.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cas9/gRNA vector design. gRNAs were cloned into px330 vectors (Life 
Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) via BbsI restriction enzyme sites upstream 
of the scaffold gRNA sequence and the mCherry reporter (Addgene, 
Cambridge, MA) was cloned downstream of the Cas9 transcript, which 
was under constitutive expression by cytomegalovirus promoter.
Figure 5 PR rescue by gRNATRGT treatment corresponded with vision rescue. (a) Fluorescent microscopy montage image shows mCherry+ reporter 
distribution (arrows) of gRNATRGT vector in a retinal flat-mount at P33 calculated at 29% of total retina area by NIH ImageJ analysis. (b) By retinal 
cross-section, mCherry+ regions from gRNATRGT treatment contained significantly more PR nuclei than the mCherry+ regions from gRNACNTRL treat-
ment, or comparable regions from untreated control areas (gRNATRGT: 307 ± 82 PR nuclei/100 μm, N = 5 versus gRNACNTRL: 33 ± 3, **P ≤ 0.01, N = 3 
versus Untreated: 27 ± 13, ††P ≤ 0.01, N = 4). (c) Visual acuity (optokinetic response) was significantly higher from gRNATRGT treatment at P39, than 
from gRNACNTRL treatment (gRNATRGT: 0.185 ± 0.008 c/d, N = 5 versus gRNACNTRL: 0.121 ± 0.009 c/d, N = 4, ††P ≤ 0.01). Visual acuity in  
gRNATRGT-treated 
eyes was significantly higher than in untreated contralateral eyes (Treated: 0.185 ± 0.008 versus Contralateral: 0.138 ± 0.006 c/d, N = 5, ***P ≤ 0.001). 
Visual acuity in eyes injected with gRNACNTRL was not different from that of contralateral noninjected eyes (Treated: 0.121 ± 0.009 versus Contralateral: 
0.121 ± 0.012 c/d, N = 4, P = 0.763). (d) By using the fellow eyes of individual animals as internal controls, the higher visual acuity from gRNATRGT 
treatment represented a 35 ± 4.6% increase, compared to a 2.3 ± 0.7% decrease with gRNACNTRL injection (P < 0.01). c/d = cycles/degree. All values

CRISPR Gene Therapy Corrects Retinitis Pigmentosa
Cas9 cleavage efficiency determination.  RhoS334-selective disruption was 
confirmed in PRs that were fluorescence-activated cell sorting-isolated 
by mCherryHi and intermediate/low mCherryLo expression and was con-
firmed absent in mCherry-negative (mCherryNeg) PRs from three animals 
(Supplementary Figure S2). Cleavage efficiency was calculated from 
the indel frequency among bacterial clones transfected with DNA from 
mCherry-isolated cells. Genomic DNA was extracted from mCherry+ 
PRs or MSCsS334 and subjected to PCR amplification using primers that 
flanked the predicted Cas9 cut site regions. Amplicons from on- and off-
target cleavage sites were ligated into plasmids (T-vector Cloning Kit, Life 
Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) and transfected into high-efficiency  
NEB-α 
E. coli (New England BioLabs, Ipswich, MA) for DNA Sanger sequenc-
ing analysis of 21–42 clones from which the ratios of genomic disruptions 
were used to quantify cleavage efficiency (Supplementary Table S2). 
Animal procedures.  All animal procedures were performed in accordance 
with the Cedars-Sinai Medical Center’
s Institutional Animal Care and Use 
Committee and the ARVO Statement for the Use of Animals in Ophthalmic 
and Vision Research. Injection methods used were slightly modified from 
a previous published protocol.26 S334ter-3 P0 rats were anesthetized on ice 
for 5 minutes, and 1 μl of plasmid DNA (6–7.4 μg/μl) was diluted 0.1× (v/v) 
with Fast-Green DNA dye and subretinally injected by floating needle into 
S334ter-3 rats. Subsequent electroporation of plasmid DNA consisted of 
five pulses at 115 mV with 50-ms duration and  
950-ms intervals, using a 
longitudinal sweeping motion with 7-mm Platinum Tweezertrodes lubri-
cated with conductance enhancing SignaGel (ECM 830 System, Harvard 
Apparatus, Holliston, MA). Positive charge was generated over the injected 
eye. Pups were allowed to recover on a heating pad.
Cell sources and cell processing.  Eyes were surgically removed and kept 
in 4–6 °
C phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) for ~30 minutes. Retinas 
were dissected and subjected to single-cell dissociation by incubating for 
20 minutes at 37 °
C in enzymatic digestion solution consisting of  
Ca2+/
Mg2+-free phosphate-buffered saline, 20 U/ml papain, and 0.5 mmol/l 
l-cysteine (Worthington Biochemical Corp., Lakewood, NJ). mCherry+ 
retinal cells were sorted (FACSAria III, BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, 
NJ) into 1.7 ml DNase-free tubes (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany) con-
taining 4 °
C  
phosphate-buffered saline and subjected to genomic DNA 
extraction (Purelink Genomic DNA Mini Kit, Life Technologies). MSCsS334 
were derived from adult rats as previously described.27 Briefly, the femurs 
of 6–8-week-old S334ter-3 rats were flushed with Dulbecco'
s Modified 
Eagle Medium (Life Technologies), gently triturated in 5 ml syringe, 
passed through a 40 μm strainer, centrifuged at 600 
× 
g for 10 minutes, 
plated at 1,000 cells/cm2 onto T75 tissue culture flasks (Corning, Corning, 
NY) in growth medium consisting of Dulbecco'
s Modified Eagle Medium 
containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Atlanta Biologicals, Lawrenceville, 
GA), 100 U/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate (Life 
Technologies), and cultured in a humidified incubator at 37°
 and 5% CO2. 
Nonadherent cells were removed by media change after 24 hours.
Immunofluorescent staining and confocal microscopy.  Eyes were enu-
cleated and fixed (4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline) 
for 1 hour and embedded in OCT Compound (Sakura Finetek, Torrance, 
CA) after 30% sucrose infiltration. Select eyes were prepared for retinal 
whole-mount dissection to assess mCherry distribution prior to embed-
ding. Frozen transverse 10-μm-thick retinal sections were histologically 
stained (0.4% cresyl violet acetate, Sigma Aldrich, St. Lois, MO) or immu-
nolabeled with antibodies generated against:
 Cone arrestin (rabbit poly-
clonal, 1:
1,000, AB15282, Millipore, Billerica, MA), protein kinase C-α 
(rabbit polyclonal, 1:
5,000, P4334, Sigma), Synaptophysin (mouse clone 
SVP-38, 1:
2,000, Millipore MAB368), Rhodopsin (C-terminal, clone 1D4, 
1:
100, Millipore MAB5356 or N-terminal, 1:
100, clone RET-P1, Millipore 
MAB5316). Alexa-Fluor-488 (1:
500; Life Technologies) was used to visual-
ize sections along with nuclear counterstain (49,69-diamidino-2-phenyl-
indole, Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Images were captured by 
confocal microscopy (Eclipse C1si, Nikon Instruments, Melville, NY) and 
morphology, mCherry distribution, and PR nuclei counts were analyzed 
by Image J software (NIH, Bethesda, MD).
Visual function assessment. Animals were tested for spatial visual acuity 
by OptoMotry testing apparatus (CerebralMechanics, Lethbridge, Alberta, 
Canada) as previously described,28 in which four computer monitors are 
arranged in a square to project a 3D virtual space of a rotating cylinder 
lined with vertical sine wave grating. Unrestrained animals on a center 
platform tracked the projected image of rotating grating with reflexive 
head movements. The spatial frequency of the grating (cycles per degree) 
was centered on the rats’
 viewing position, and maximal acuity ascertained 
by increasing the grating frequency at psychophysics staircase progression 
until the tracking response was lost.
Statistical significance. Student’
s t-tests were performed using  
two-tailed 
distribution, and two-sample unequal variance (heteroscedastic) to 
compare optokinetic response cycles/degree values from treated versus 
untreated eyes of individual animals, as well as between animals of treat-
ment groups; gRNATRGT (N = 5) and gRNACNTRL (N = 4). Contralateral 
noninjected eyes served as untreated controls. Error bars indicate standard 
error mean. Statistical significance:
 **P 
≤ 
0.01, ††P 
≤ 
0.01, ***P 
≤ 
0.001.
