Abstract
There is a popular belief that the lunar cycle influences spontaneous delivery in both
humans and cattle. To assess this relationship, we investigated the synodic distribution of
spontaneous deliveries in domestic Holstein cows. We used retrospective data from 428
spontaneous, full-term deliveries within a three-year period derived from the calving records
of a private farm in Hokkaido, Japan. Spontaneous birth frequency increased uniformly
from the new moon to the full moon phase and decreased until the waning crescent phase.
There was a statistically significant peak between the waxing gibbous and full moon phases
compared with those between the last quarter and the waning crescent. These changes
were clearly observed in deliveries among multiparous cows, whereas they were not evi-
dent in deliveries among nulliparous cows. These data suggest the utility of dairy cows as
models for bio-meteorological studies, and indicate that monitoring lunar phases may facili-
tate comprehensive understanding of parturition.
Introduction
In hospital delivery units, there is frequently a perception that the onset of delivery is influ-
enced by environmental factors. Climatic conditions, such as atmospheric pressure, time of
day, and weekly patterns, are reported to influence admission for labor and/or delivery [1–3].
It is also believed that the phase of the lunar cycle affects delivery timing; however, most of the
scientific reports concerning lunar influence on deliveries remain controversial [3–13].
Although epidemiological research is the best approach for direct observation of human
physiological phenomena, it is sometimes difficult to draw conclusions because differences in
genetic, nutritional, environmental, and social backgrounds can cause complex variations in
the data. Thus, to minimize the influence of such factors, we focused on data from domestic
Holstein cows. It is known that domestication generally decreases the genetic diversity of
strains and that the Holstein breed has much lower genetic variability than other cattle breeds
based on microsatellite DNA analysis [14]. In addition, they are rigorously managed under
uniform conditions by professional dairy farmers. In the cattle industry, it is likewise believed
that the full moon influences delivery. Weather patterns, such as changes in atmospheric pres-
sure and temperature, have been reported to affect timing of birth in cattle [15], which is con-
sistent with comparable reports for humans [1–3]. Hence, in the present study, we investigated
the relationship between lunar phases and calving dates of Holstein cows.

 Materials and Methods
We used the calving records from one private farm, which belonged to the National Agricul-
tural Insurance Association (NOSAI) in Ishikari (Hokkaido, Japan), for the three-year period
between September 1, 2011 and August 31, 2013. There were always around 300 adult, 50
growing cattle and 30 calves in the farm. The commercial purpose of the farm was dairy hus-
bandry. We included 428 spontaneous full-term deliveries that were not driven by any parturi-
facients (S1 Table). The mean age of the 428 Holstein cows was 3.52 (SD = 1.62) years and the
mean gestational age was 283.54 (SD = 4.04) days. Thus, the predicted delivery dates were
defined as 284 days after the dates of final artificial insemination (AI) in this study. Among 428
deliveries, 145 were from nulliparous heifers (33.9%) and 283 (66.1%) were from multiparous
cows. These 428 deliveries were obtained from 314 individual cows; 200 cows delivered once
and 114 cows delivered twice during the observation period. Out of 114 cows, 43 experienced
their first and second deliveries, 44 their second and third, 12 their third and fourth, six their
fourth and fifth, five their fifth and sixth, two their sixth and seventh, and two their seventh
and eighth.
The length of the estrous cycle in cows is approximately 21 days and the timing of AI was
decided using the a.m.-p.m. rule by the local veterinarian. Cows were pastured or reared in a
free stall (10 m2/head) until approximately 60 days before the predicted delivery date and were
then reared in a free barn (10 m2/head) until delivery. Free stalls had individual spaces for cows
and they were loosely restrained within these. Free barns did not have the equipment to
restrain cattle and cows were put within the compartment surrounding the fences. Free stalls
and barns did not have night illumination or robust walls. The delivery date was defined as
6:00 a.m. on the day parturition was completed until 6:00 a.m. the next morning.
The exact timing of the lunar phases and weather reports were derived from data presented
by the Japanese Meteorological Agency. Since the length of a lunar month is 29.53 days, the
eight phases of the moon were categorized; new moon to waxing crescent (0 to 3.69), wax cres-
cent to first quarter (3.69–7.38), first quarter to waxing gibbous (7.38–11.07), waxing gibbous
to full moon (11.07–14.76), full moon to waning gibbous (14.76-–18.45), waning gibbous to
last quarter (18.45–22.14), last quarter to waning crescent (22.14–25.83), and waning crescent
to new moon (25.83–29.53). The birth frequency was defined as the number of births in the
lunar phase in relation to all deliveries.
Statistical analyses were performed as reported by Ochiai et al. [5] using R based software
(ver. 3.2.2, R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria). Distributions of deliver-
ies during the lunar phases were compared using χ2 tests followed by multiple comparisons
using Ryan-Holm step-down Bonferroni tests. Differences between the actual and predicted
delivery dates were compared using Kruskal-Wallis tests and Steel-Dwass post hoc tests. Differ-
ences were considered significant when p < 0.05.
Results
Among all spontaneous deliveries, birth frequency increased uniformly from the new moon to
the full moon phase, and then decreased until the waning crescent (Fig 1A). The results of the
χ2 test (χ2 = 15.963, d.f. = 7, p = 0.0255) warranted rejection of the null hypothesis, and subse-
quent multiple comparisons indicated that the number of deliveries was significantly higher
between the waxing gibbous and full moon phases (p = 0.0006).
Fig 1B and 1C show the distribution of deliveries among nulliparous and multiparous cows
according to the lunar cycle. Delivery timing among nulliparous cows did not significantly
change throughout the lunar cycle, although it exhibited a tendency to increase between the
waxing gibbous and full moon phases (χ2 = 5.68, d.f. = 7, p = 0.5781, Fig 1B). In contrast, there

 was a clear and significant relationship between delivery timing among multiparous cows and
the lunar cycle (χ2 = 15.88, d.f. = 7, p = 0.0262, Fig 1C). Subsequent multiple comparison tests
showed that the number of deliveries was significantly greater between the waxing gibbous and
full moon phases compared with that between the last quarter and the waning crescent phases
(p = 0.0016).
In further analyses, the numbers of days between predicted and actual delivery dates dif-
fered significantly among the eight moon phases for all cows, and for multiparous cows (Fig
2). Fig 2 presents an analysis based on the same parturition data used in Fig 1. Specifically,
cows with predicted delivery dates during the new moon to first quarter phase tended to
delay delivery, whereas those with predicted delivery dates during the full moon to last quar-
ter phase tended to deliver when predicted. Finally, a significant difference was observed
between the new moon to waxing crescent phase and the waning crescent to last quarter
phase (Fig 2A and 2C).

 To determine whether the difference in delivery dates could be caused by individual speci-
ficity, the correlation of gaps exhibited by the same cows was analyzed. It is visualized as a scat-
tered plot in S1 Fig. This figure shows the correlation of gaps between two deliveries for each
cow (n = 114). There were no correlations between the gaps for the former and latter delivery
dates for the same cows (R2 = 0.1162, p = 0.5925). This suggested that the difference between
the actual and predicted delivery date was not related to individual specificity.
To assess data quality, we separated the lunar cycle into broad and detailed phases using the
same data. When the lunar cycle was separated into four phases, a significant alteration was
observed (Fig 3A). However, when it was separated into 16 phases, no significant difference
was observed, although a peak in deliveries was observed around the full moon phase (Fig 3B).
In addition, correlation between delivery date and weather was analyzed. According to
weather reports, there were 393 sunny, 305 cloudy, 18 rainy, and 15 snowy days during the
observation period (Sep 2011 to Aug 2013). The weather conditions for the 428 deliveries were
237 sunny, 179 cloudy, four rainy, and eight snowy days. There was no significant relationship
between weather conditions and delivery timing (χ2 = 3.495, d.f. = 3, p = 0.3215).
Discussion
Although there has been a pervasive belief that the lunar cycle can influence labor onset and par-
turition, most researchers remain skeptical based on retrospective evidence. Two studies from
the USA [11, 12], one from Germany [16], and one from Brazil [3] showed no lunar influence on
hospital admissions for labor. Although Ghiandoni et al. reported a higher rate of childbirth in
Italy during the full moon phase [13], they also claimed that the association was too weak to pre-
dict the days with the highest frequency of deliveries. However, various factors could influence
birth frequency in humans, which could mask the influence of the lunar phase. For instance,

comparison tests; n.s., not significant; expected numbers of deliveries are indicated by horizontal lines.

 obesity affects the length of gestation [17], weekends tend to yield reduced childbirth frequency,
and there are peaks in labor admission rates on Mondays and Fridays [3]. To minimize the effects
of these factors, we focused on domestic Holstein cows. Compared to humans, the subjects were
more genetically related, because spermatozoa of breeding cattle were rigorously selected. Their
feeding and nutrition were uniformly managed by dairy farmers, and their behavior and social
interactions were not as complex as those of humans. Elimination of some of the sources of varia-
tion inherent in humans could be one of the reasons why our data showed a clear trend in com-
parison with that of previous reports. Nevertheless, the present results cannot be extrapolated
directly to humans because reproductive physiology can be quite different between species.
Ghiandoni et al. reported the relationship between parity and delivery timing during the
various lunar phases [13]. Although they found a clear and significant cluster of deliveries
around the time of the full moon in multiparae, they adopted a cautious stance in drawing con-
clusions because differences could have existed between reality and memory regarding the
actual time of delivery for previous pregnancies [13]. In the present study, we also found a sig-
nificant increase in the number of deliveries around the full moon phase in multiparae, whereas
a similar trend was not evident in nulliparous dairy cows. The insemination and parturition
records of cattle are accurate in comparison with human memory. Although we used data from
cattle only, our findings support the relationship between lunar phases and parity hypothesized
by Ghiandoni et al. In addition, dystocia is a widely accepted risk during first parturition in
cows, reflecting smaller sizes and weights of younger primiparous dams [18]. Dystocia can last
for several days in heifers, and thus advances or delays in time of birth could be sufficient to
influence our findings. Hence, these complications in spontaneous deliveries among primipa-
rous cows may obscure the influence of the lunar phase.
It is difficult to explain the mechanism by which the moon influences birth frequency. In
one supposition, lunar gravity could be linked to uterine contractions through the release of
oxytocin, which has also been identified as a cardiovascular hormone. In addition, plasma lev-
els of oxytocin are increased by increases in arterial blood pressure in rats [19]. Because blood
pressure is positively correlated with gravity [20], an increase in gravitational forces during the
gibbous lunar phase might be a trigger for oxytocin release and subsequent delivery. Neverthe-
less, although changes in gravitational forces during the lunar phase are sufficient to produce
tidal forces, animal weights are miniscule compared with that of the planet, and changes in
gravity between lunar phases are approximately one of 0.3 millionth. Moreover, although lunar
gravity increases in both the full moon and new moon phases, the birth frequency in the pres-
ent study showed a significant increase only during the full moon phase. Hence, gravitational
forces are an unlikely factor in the chronobiology of delivery timing.
Another explanation could be attributed to melatonin secretion. The influence of variations
in lunar light on melatonin secretion has been reported; nocturnal secretion of melatonin
shows a considerable decrease around the full moon phase [21]. Melatonin secretion is also
increased toward the end of gestation and rapidly drops to non-pregnancy levels at parturition
in humans [22]. In rats, low gravity can have a direct and/or indirect influence on delivery by
altering melatonin levels [23]. In this study, there were no robust walls or artificial lights
around the free stall or barns. Although we did not measure the light intensities in these areas,
both the free stall and free barn were easily penetrated by moon light. Currently, humans are
perpetually exposed to significant artificial lighting. Based on our hypothesis, the artificial light
period could cancel the influence of the lunar cycle in humans, which might be one of the rea-
sons why human data did not vary with the lunar phases [3–13, 16]. Thus, birth frequency
might be enhanced by reduced melatonin secretion around the time of the full moon.
Because melatonin levels are closely dependent on photoperiod, it is possible that the
weather condition could influence experimental data. Nevertheless, we think the effect of

 weather would be nullified if the experiment was performed throughout a substantial number
of lunar cycles. Indeed, a previous report on humans that showed clear relationship between
melatonin levels and the lunar phases did not specify the relationship of weather conditions
[21]. Because they studied 64 specimens over four years, the variation in weather conditions
should have been negated [21]. In this study, our data was collected throughout 25 lunar cycles.
The Ishikari area of Hokkaido in Japan does not have a rainy season or experience much snow.
When we analyzed the effect of weather conditions on delivery timing, no significant relation-
ship was found. This suggests that the variation in weather conditions among the lunar phases
was also negated in our study.
Another possibility is that the lunar cycle could influence the ovulation ratio and/or fertili-
zation ratio. There are few reports based on the relationship between the lunar cycle and ovula-
tion that can be analyzed epidemiologically. In a study that analyzed data from over 300
women, no statistical relationship was observed among them, although women tended to ovu-
late in the dark phase of the lunar period [24]. In the present study, there was no significant
correlation between the date of AI and the lunar cycle (S2 Fig). Nevertheless, the number of
AI tended to increase in the dark phase of the lunar period, which implies the same tendency
as observed in the study on women [24]. However, it would be difficult to perform a detailed
evaluation because data on the incidence rate of estrus, total number of AIs performed, and
success rate of AIs were not collected in the present study. Nevertheless, any physiological
explanations are speculative and further studies are needed to go beyond phenomenological
analysis.
In the present study, we separated the lunar cycle into eight phases. When the lunar cycle
was separated into four phases, there was a significant peak between the first quarter and full
moon phases. However, when the cycle was separated into 16 phases, there was no significant
difference, even though a peak was observed. This variation could be attributed to the relatively
small sample size. It was difficult to make draw definitive conclusions because of the limited
sample size in this study.
In summary, the present study used dairy cows to answer practical questions about full
moon deliveries. A significant relationship between the distribution of spontaneous deliveries
and the lunar phase was found, particularly among multiparous dairy cows. These results sug-
gest that the dairy cow may be a good model for bio-meteorological study, and that monitoring
lunar phases provides considerable information for understanding the influences on delivery
more comprehensively.
