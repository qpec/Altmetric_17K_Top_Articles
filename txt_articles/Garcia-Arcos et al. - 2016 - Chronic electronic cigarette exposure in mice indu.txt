ABSTRACT
Background The use of electronic (e)-cigarettes is
increasing rapidly, but their lung health effects are not
established. Clinical studies examining the potential
long-term impact of e-cigarette use on lung health will
take decades. To address this gap in knowledge, this
study investigated the effects of exposure to aerosolised
nicotine-free and nicotine-containing e-cigarette fluid on
mouse lungs and normal human airway epithelial cells.
Methods Mice were exposed to aerosolised
phosphate-buffered saline, nicotine-free or nicotine-
containing e-cigarette solution, 1-hour daily for
4 months. Normal human bronchial epithelial (NHBE)
cells cultured at an air-liquid interface were exposed to
e-cigarette vapours or nicotine solutions using a Vitrocell
smoke exposure robot.
Results Inhalation of nicotine-containing e-cigarettes
increased airway hyper-reactivity, distal airspace
enlargement, mucin production, cytokine and protease
expression. Exposure to nicotine-free e-cigarettes did not
affect these lung parameters. NHBE cells exposed to
nicotine-containing e-cigarette vapour showed impaired
ciliary beat frequency, airway surface liquid volume, cystic
fibrosis transmembrane regulator and ATP-stimulated
K+ ion conductance and decreased expression of FOXJ1
and KCNMA1. Exposure of NHBE cells to nicotine for
5 days increased interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-8 secretion.
Conclusions Exposure to inhaled nicotine-containing
e-cigarette fluids triggered effects normally associated
with the development of COPD including cytokine
expression, airway hyper-reactivity and lung tissue
destruction. These effects were nicotine-dependent both
in the mouse lung and in human airway cells,
suggesting that inhaled nicotine contributes to airway
and lung disease in addition to its addictive properties.
Thus, these findings highlight the potential dangers of
nicotine inhalation during e-cigarette use.
INTRODUCTION
Exposure to cigarette smoking is the leading cause
of preventable death in the USA. The majority of
COPD deaths are associated with smoke exposure,
with COPD now ranking as the third leading cause
of death in the USA1 and it is projected to become
the third leading cause worldwide within the next
20 years.2 Quitting smoking lowers the risk for
several diseases and can increase life expectancy.2
Though
smoking
prevalence
in
the
USA
has
decreased over the past 50 years, approximately
19%
of
the
population
continues to
smoke.3
Though nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) helps,
nearly 93% of smokers will relapse despite NRT
within 6 months of quitting.4 Given these difficul-
ties with smoking cessation and the enormous
public health burden imposed by COPD, some
healthcare advocates have argued that electronic
(e)-cigarettes are a safer alternative for those indivi-
duals who cannot quit.5
e-Cigarettes are devices that effectively deliver
vaporised liquid nicotine to the lungs. The user can
choose the nicotine concentration of e-cigarette
liquid (e-liquid) that is loaded into the device’s
cartridge. When the user inhales, the e-liquid, pri-
marily nicotine in propylene glycol (PG) or vege-
table glycerine (VG), is heated to produce a vapour
that is inhaled into the lungs. Despite the many fla-
vours and varieties available, almost all consumers
choose e-liquids that contain nicotine.6 Recent
studies indicate that e-cigarette exposure could
pose several future health problems. The use of e-
cigarettes enhances oxidative stress and inflamma-
tion in mice7 and impairs immune defence against
bacterial and viral infection.8 This also has implica-
tions in secondhand smoke exposure as e-cigarettes
significantly increase the nicotine content of indoor
air and expose non-users to secondhand vapours.9

Key messages
What is the key question?
▸ What are the pulmonary consequences of
electronic (e)-cigarette inhalation?
What is the bottom line?
▸ These findings show that the inhalation of
nicotine present in e-cigarettes alters
inflammation, ion conductance and mucociliary
function in human bronchial epithelial cells and
induces airway hyper-reactivity and air space
enlargement in exposed mice.
Why read on?
▸ This study provides insights into the lung
health effects of e-cigarettes and also
implicates nicotine as a causative factor at the
onset and progression of COPD.

 lipopolysaccharide-challenged mice and inflammation in lung
epithelial cells.10 Nicotine also suppresses apoptosis in lung
tumours.11 However, the biological effects of nicotine delivered
to the lungs by e-cigarettes have not been thoroughly studied.
Here, we used in vitro and in vivo models to evaluate the bio-
logical impact of e-cigarette usage on mouse lungs and in
normal human bronchial epithelial (NHBE) cells collected from
a series of human subjects. This study found that inhaled nico-
tine in e-cigarettes triggered effects associated with the patho-
genesis
and
progression
of
COPD:
airspace
enlargement,
mucous cell hypertrophy, release of inflammatory mediators and
altered epithelial ciliary function. The data collected provide
direct evidence of the potential harmful effects of e-cigarettes
and, in particular, nicotine inhalation into the lung.
METHODS
In vivo inhaled exposure to e-cigarette fluids
All animal experiments were performed with approval from
Mount Sinai Roosevelt Medical Center’s Institutional Animal Care
and Use Committee. W
e developed an in vivo e-cigarette exposure
model using an mouse pie cage (MPC) Aerosol Medication
Nebulizer (Braintree Scientific, Braintree, Massachusetts, USA).
For 4 months (5 days/week), A/J mice aged 12 weeks (Jackson
labs) were whole body exposed to 0.4 mL of phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS) or e-cigarette vehicle (PG and VG 50/50; American
eLiquid Store) containing 0 or 18 mg/mL nicotine (American
eLiquid Store). All liquids were preheated to 37°C prior to nebuli-
sation and the exposures lasted 1 hour. Mice were euthanised
24 hours after the last exposure. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid
(BALF) was collected and immune cells quantified as previously
described.12 Plasma cotinine levels were measured using a com-
mercially available kit and following the manufacturer’s instruc-
tions (Abnova, W
alnut, California, USA).
Airway responses to methacholine challenge
Airway responses to increasing doses of methacholine (Sigma
Chemical, St. Louis, Missouri, USA) were assessed with the
Scireq Flexivent system (Scireq, Montreal, Quebec, Canada) in
mice exposed to 4 months of PBS and e-liquid containing 0 or
18 mg/mL nicotine. Animals were anaesthetised with ketamine/
xylazine (10 mg/kg) and paralysis was induced with 1 mg/kg
pancuronium bromide intraperitoneally. Baseline pulmonary
function measurements (forced expiratory flow at 50% of FVC
(FEF50)) were determined prior to methacholine challenge in
mice. The linear single-compartment model was used to assess
total respiratory system resistance.
Histological analysis
The lungs underwent pressure-fixation and fixed tissue was pro-
cessed and H&E stained for analysis of morphometry as previ-
ously described.13 Mucin was stained with Alcian blue and
counterstained with Safranin O using a commercially available
kit (Abcam, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA). For immunofluor-
escence, slides were blocked with 10% goat serum in PBS for
1 hour at room temperature. The slides were incubated with
primary antibody (rabbit polyclonal anti-MUC5AC IgG, 1:50
dilution; Santa Cruz Bio) or rabbit IgG negative control in 5%
goat serum 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS overnight at 4°C
and then with secondary antibody (donkey antirabbit IgG-546,
1:200
dilution)
for
1 hour
at
room
temperature.
Immunoreactivity was visualised with an epifluorescence micro-
scope. Tissue quantification of macrophages, neutrophils and
lymphocytes were detected on slides with primary antibodies;
rabbit
polyclonal
anti-MAC3,
antineutrophil
elastase
or
anti-CD3 IgG (Abcam; 1:50 dilution). Immune cells were quan-
tified from 10 randomly selected ×400 images of the lung
tissue sections from each mouse.
Cell viability analysis
Apoptosis was determined on paraffin-embedded tissue by the
terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end-labelling
(TUNEL)
in
situ
cell
death
detection
kit
AP
(Roche
Diagnostics), following the manufacturer’s instructions. For each
lung, 10 random sections were obtained at three different
depths of tissue sectioning and a minimum of 1000 cells/section
were visually evaluated after staining. The positively labelled
cells were expressed as a percentage of total nuclei. Caspase 3/7
activity was measured as previously described,14 using a com-
mercially available Caspase-Glo 3/7 Assay System (Promega,
Fitchburg, Michigan, USA). In vitro cell viability was deter-
mined by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) released into media
using a commercially available assay (Sigma Aldrich).
qPCR, MMP and cytokine protein detection
RNA was isolated using the Qiagen RNeasy kit and complemen-
tary DNA (cDNA) was reverse transcribed using the Applied
Biosystems high-capacity cDNA kit. qPCR was performed on
the Bio-Rad CFX384 real-time system using validated TaqMan
probes (Life T
echnologies/Applied Biosystems). qPCR results are
represented as relative quantification. Gene expression was nor-
malised to β-actin or glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase
(GAPDH).
Cytokine protein levels were measured in culture media using
a beads assay on a Bio-Rad Bio-Plex 200 system (Bio-Rad,
Hercules, California, USA). Collagenase units were calculated as
the number of mmoles of leucine liberated per mg of enzyme,
by a colorimetric ninhydrin method.15 Cathepsin activity assays
were performed as previously described.16
Immunoblot analysis
Lung tissue was homogenised in four volumes of radioimmuno-
precipitation assay buffer. Equal concentrations of protein were
immunoblotted for phosphorylated PKCα (p-PKCα), PKCα,
phosphorylated extracellular regulated kinase (ERK), ERK and
β-actin (Cell Signaling T
echnology, Danvers, Massachusetts,
USA). Chemiluminescence was detected and quantified with a
Molecular Imager ChemiDoc XRS+ (Bio-Rad). Densitometry
was performed and represented as a ratio of pixel intensity of
the phosphorylated protein compared with total protein, using
Bio-Rad Laboratories Image Lab software (V
.4.0, build 16).
In vitro analyses of NHBE cells
NHBE cells were isolated from appropriately consented donors
whose lungs were found unsuitable for transplantation. The 15
donors were non-smokers with no known airway diseases, 5
females and 10 males aged 25–58 years. From a racial aspect,
there were 10 Caucasians, 2 African-Americans, 1 Hispanic
white and 2 unknowns. After expansion, cells were redifferen-
tiated at the air–liquid interface (ALI) on collagen-coated
12-mm
Transwell
inserts
(Corning,
Lowell,
Massachusetts,
USA).17–19 The cells were exposed to 36 puffs of vaporised
e-liquid either containing 0 or 36 mg/mL nicotine using the
VC-1 exposure system (Vitrocell Systems, W
aldkirch, Germany),
with a 70 mL puff volume applied every 30 s. Cells were also
exposed to nicotine (0 or 100 μM, with an estimated final
100 nM nicotine concentration in the airway surface liquid
(ASL) after nebulisation) aerosolised in the Cloud system

Ion channel function and mucociliary clearance
Short-circuit currents (Isc) and ciliary beat frequency (CBF) were
recorded at the following time points: 8 hours after vapour
exposure in the VC-1 system, 4 hours after nebulised nicotine in
the Cloud system and 12 hours after basolateral addition of nico-
tine.20 Cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR) function
was determined by the decrease in Isc after addition of CFTR-inh
in cells stimulated with 10 mM forskolin in the presence of
10 mM amiloride at room temperature. Apical, ATP-stimulated
K+ (BK) currents were measured as previously described.20

sented as dot plots with a line denoting the mean and bars

Jolla, California, USA) was used for all data analysis and graph-
ical representations.
RESULTS
Exposure to inhaled nicotine-containing e-cigarette fluids
induces airway hyper-reactivity and airspace enlargement
Mice were exposed to aerosolised PBS and e-liquid (0 and
18 mg/mL nicotine) daily for 4 months. Exposure to aerosolised
nicotine-containing e-cigarettes increased plasma cotinine, the
nicotine degradation product, demonstrating that nicotine was
effectively delivered to the lungs and absorbed systemically by
the mice (figure 1A). Airway hyper-reactivity was assessed by
methacholine challenge test. At every methacholine dose ≥1 mg/
mL, mice exposed to nicotine-containing e-cigarette fluids
showed significantly higher respiratory resistance than mice
exposed to aerosolised PBS or to e-cigarette fluids that did not
contain nicotine (figure 1B and online supplementary figure S1).
No differences in airway hyper-reactivity were found in mice
exposed to nicotine-free e-cigarette fluids when compared with
mice exposed to PBS. To examine baseline lung function
changes due to e-cigarette use, forced expiratory flow at 50%
(FEF50) of FVC was determined. The FEF50/FVC ratio was sig-
nificantly reduced from 23±1.2 in mice exposed to nicotine-
free e-cigarette fluids to 15±1.5 in mice exposed to e-cigarettes
containing 18 mg/mL nicotine (average±SEM; p<0.01), sug-
gesting obstruction of the small airways (figure 1C).
Mice exposed to inhalation of nicotine-containing e-cigarette
fluids showed significant airspace enlargement, while nicotine-free
e-cigarette fluids or PBS exposure had no impact on lung
architecture (figure 1D). Mean linear intercept, surface area/unit
volume
ratio
and
fractional
volume
were
calculated
in
H&E-stained lung sections. All three parameters were altered in
the mice exposed to nicotine-containing e-cigarette fluids: mean
linear intercept was increased and surface area/unit volume and
fractional volume were decreased (p<0.05 for all; figure 1D). No
difference in any of these parameters was observed between mice
exposed to nicotine-free e-cigarette fluids or PBS (figure 1D).
Nicotine inhalation enhanced inflammatory cell infiltration
into the lung. After 2 weeks of exposure, BALF cells increased
from 130 000±27 000 cells/mouse in the mice exposed to
nicotine-free e-cigarette fluids to 280 000±41 000 cells/mouse
in the mice exposed to nicotine-containing e-cigarette fluids
(p<0.01; mean±SEM; online supplementary figure S2D). After
4 months of exposure, mice exposed to nicotine-containing e-
cigarette fluids showed a trend towards increased cell number in
BALF (figure 2A). Cytospins showed that macrophages were the
most abundant cell type recovered in the bronchoalveolar lavage
in all three conditions, while neutrophil and lymphocytes consti-
tuted a minor proportion (figure 2A). Macrophages were
observed in the alveolar space in all mouse groups (figure 2B)
and quantification of tissue inflammation demonstrated that ele-
vated macrophage numbers in lung tissue of mice subjected to
nicotine-containing e-cigarette fluids compared with the other
groups (figure 2C). Neutrophil and lymphocyte numbers were
not altered (figure 2C).
Nicotine in e-cigarette fluids triggers mucin production and
apoptosis
Airway mucin production increased in mice exposed to nicotine-
containing e-cigarette fluids, as shown by Alcian blue staining
and fluorescence microscopy for MUC5AC (figure 3A). Mice
exposed to nicotine-containing e-cigarette fluids showed a
twofold increase in Muc5ac gene expression (p<0.01; figure
3A). Apoptosis of structural cells in the lung is another import-
ant event in the pathogenesis of COPD.21 Apoptosis, as esti-
mated by TUNEL staining, increased within the alveoli and the
airway epithelium of mice exposed to e-cigarette fluids that con-
tained nicotine (figure 3B). Caspase 3/7 activity, increased from
37±1.5 units of luminescence in nicotine-free e-cigarette fluid
exposed mice to 53±4.7 units of luminescence in nicotine-
containing
e-cigarette
fluid
exposed
mice
(p<0.01;
mean
±SEM; figure 3B). Taken together, nicotine in e-cigarettes pro-
motes airway hyper-reactivity, inflammation, airway enlarge-
ments, mucus production and lung cell apoptosis.
E-cigarette fluids containing nicotine induce lung cytokine
and protease expression
Expression of several cytokines and proteases associated with
tissue remodelling was measured in lung homogenates after
2 weeks (see online supplementary figure S2A–C) and 4 months
of exposure (figure 4). Compared with exposure to inhaled
e-cigarette fluids that lacked nicotine (0 mg/mL), e-cigarette fluid
containing nicotine (18 mg/mL) caused a significant increase in
the expression of Il-1β, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1
(MCP-1), Cxcl10, Il-6 and Cxcl2 (p<0.05 for all; figure 4A).
Matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 and MMP-12 and cathepsins
K and L1 also showed increased messenger RNA expression in
the mice exposed to e-cigarette fluids containing nicotine (figure
4B). Collagenase BALF activity increased by 70% (p<0.03) and
cathepsin BALF activity showed a trend towards an increase in
the BALF of mice exposed to e-cigarette fluids that contained
nicotine (figure 4C). Expression of Mcp-1, Muc5ac and CatK
showed similar patterns after 2 weeks of exposure to nicotine-

 containing e-cigarettes (see online supplementary figure S2).
Our findings indicate that inhalation of nicotine via e-cigarette
fluids can induce cytokine and protease expression and activity
in a similar manner to tobacco cigarette smoke exposure.
Inhalation of nicotine in e-cigarette fluids activates
PKCα/ERK signalling in the lung
Our laboratory has previously shown that activation of PKCα
and ERK by cigarette smoke regulated lung inflammation and
protease
responses.22
Since
nicotine
can
stimulate
the
α-7-nicotinic receptor (α7nAchR) upstream of PKCα and ERK
in human lung epithelial cells,11 23 we asked whether nicotine
in e-cigarette fluids would activate this signalling mechanism.
Lung homogenates from mice exposed to nicotine in e-cigarette
fluids showed increased phosphorylation of PKCα and a trend
increase in lung phosphorylation of ERK (figure 5). Of note,
inhibition of this pathway prevents airspace enlargement in the
lungs of cigarette smoke-exposed mice.22
The nicotine present in e-cigarette fluids alters ciliary
function and cytokine production in NHBE cells
W
e used fully differentiated cultures of NHBE cells to assess the
impact of nicotine-containing e-cigarette vapour on ciliary
function. NHBE cells were obtained from healthy donors, cul-
tured at the ALI and exposed to nicotine-free or to nicotine-
containing
e-cigarette
vapours
(figure
6A).
Exposure
to
vaporised e-cigarette vapour had no effects on NHBE cell viabil-
ity, determined by LDH assays (see online supplementary figure
S3A). Ciliary beating serves as one of the main defence func-
tions of the airways.24 Cells exposed to nicotine-containing
e-cigarette vapours had significantly reduced CBF 8 hours after
exposure (5.2±0.5 Hz vs 2.6±1 Hz; p=0.01; p<0.05; figure
6B). Since exposure to nicotine in e-cigarettes reduced CBF, the
per cent of cilia on the apical cell surface was determined on
NHBE cells. There was no significant difference in percentage
of ciliary area on the apical surface 24 hours after exposure to
nicotine-containing e-cigarette vapour (figure 6C). However,
the gene expression of a major regulator of ciliogenesis, FOXJ1,
was reduced in cells exposed to nicotine-containing e-cigarette
vapours (figure 6D). Ion channel conductance for CFTR was
significantly reduced in cells exposed to nicotine-containing
e-cigarette vapours 8 hours after exposure (figure 6E), and was
independent of the expression of the CFTR gene (figure 6F).
Ion channel conductance for the BK channel was also signifi-
cantly
reduced
in
cells
exposed
to
nicotine-containing
e-cigarette vapours at 8 hours after exposure (figure 6G), which

 coincided with reduced expression of BK channel α subunit
(KCNMA1) gene that regulates ASL.25 ASL volume changes
showed a significant decrease, from 14.6±2 mL in cells exposed
to nicotine-free e-cigarette vapour at 24 hours after exposure to
3.8±1 mL in cells exposed to nicotine-containing e-cigarette
vapour (mean±SEM; p<0.01; figure 6I). Therefore, nicotine in
e-cigarette vapour directly influences ciliary function.
Nicotine directly alters ciliary function and cytokine
production in NHBE cells
To examine how nicotine alone affected ion transport and CBF,
NHBE cells were exposed to 0 or 100 mM nicotine nebulised
(200 mL) into a chamber (Cloud from Vitrocell) (figure 7A).
Using a Vitrocell microbalance, we determined that there was a
total deposition of 25 nL in each well of our tissue culture
plates. Assuming an ASL volume at baseline of about 40 mL, we
calculated that the effective nicotine concentration would reach
60–120 nM in the apical surface liquid of these cells grown at
ALI. Exposure to aerosolised nicotine had no effects on NHBE
cell viability at 4 hours after nebulisation (see online supplemen-
tary figure S3B). Cells exposed to aerosolised nicotine showed
decreased CFTR and BK conductance at 4 hours after exposure
(figure 7B, C).
To analyse the effects of long-term exposure to nicotine,
NHBE cells were exposed to basolateral media supplemented
with 0, 1 or 10 mM nicotine for 5 days (figure 8A). Exposure to
nicotine in the culture media for 5 days had no effects on
NHBE cell viability (see online supplementary figure S3C). In
cells exposed to 10 mM nicotine in the culture media, CBF
decreased from 7.2±0.3 in controls to 6.2±0.3 (mean±SEM;
p<0.05; figure 8B) and there was a decreasing trend in the
CFTR activity (figure 8C). Media nicotine supplementation also
increased cytokine release both to the basolateral and the apical
sides of the NHBE cell cultures at concentrations of 10 mM:
interleukin (IL)-6 concentration in the wash increased from 390
to 442 pg/mL (p<0.05; median). IL-8 and MCP-1 also showed

 a trend towards an increase in the apical wash (figure 8D). In
the media, IL-6 and IL-8 were significantly elevated by 10 mM
nicotine exposures and MCP-1 trended towards an increase in
nicotine-exposed cells (figure 8E). Together, these data suggest
that nicotine exposure directly impacts parameters of mucocili-
ary function and promotes a pro-inflammatory state in NHBE
cells.
DISCUSSION
The Royal College of Physicians in the UK has recently advo-
cated that switching to e-cigarettes will aid smoking cessation
and reduce harm from conventional cigarette use.26 Indeed, it is
well established that e-cigarettes produce less environmental
pollutants, lack harmful tar and contain far fewer cancer-causing
chemicals.9 27 Public health experts have argued that e-cigarettes
will save lives by reducing or eliminating exposure to harmful
cigarette components. This position, however, remains contro-
versial as scientific data about the effects of e-cigarettes are
lacking. Indeed, the Food and Drug Administration in the USA
has announced that it will begin regulating e-cigarette products.
This study shows for the first time that e-cigarettes induce
pathogenic responses akin to what occurs in human COPD.
Even more importantly, it demonstrates that nicotine is the key
component responsible for these pathogenic changes in the
lung. While e-cigarette usage may potentially cause less cancer
and vascular disease compared with conventional cigarettes, our
data indicate that it will still promote the development of
obstructive airways disease. Thus, the findings from this study
should be taken into consideration when advising patients on
possible health risks of these products.
Traditionally, nicotine has been studied as the addictive com-
ponent of cigarettes, but increasing evidence indicates that nico-
tine is also a key factor in the initiation and progression of
COPD. Nicotine hinders the hydration of mucus,28 promotes
Ca2+ influx in airway smooth muscle cells,29 blocks neutrophil
apoptosis30
and
induces
pro-inflammatory
dendritic
cell
responses.31 Smoke generated from high-dose nicotine cigarettes
induces more emphysematous changes than low-dose nicotine
cigarettes, in elastase-treated rats.32 The lack of focus on nico-
tine in this disease is surprising since genetic analyses identified

 nicotinic receptors (α3nAchR and α5nAchR) as susceptibility
loci for COPD.33 Moreover, nicotine makes up almost 3% of
the dry weight of a tobacco leaf and smokers breathe in 42 mg
nicotine/day.34 Once absorbed, nicotine binds to nicotinic
acetylcholine
receptor
(nAchRs).
The
airway
epithelium
expresses α3, α4, α5, α7, α9, β2 and β4 subunits for nAchRs,35
and their expression are highest on the apical cell surface, where
exposure to inhaled nicotine occurs.36 In bronchiole cells, nico-
tine acted via α7AchR to upregulate γ-aminobutyric acid
(GABA)ARα2 and induces Muc5ac expression and mucus pro-
duction.37 This effect would explain the increased mucin stain-
ing and Muc5ac expression detected in mouse lungs following
exposure to nicotine-containing e-cigarettes. Interestingly, CFTR
and BK ion conductance and CBF were more negatively affected
at a greater magnitude in cells exposed to aerosolised nicotine
compared with cells where nicotine was supplemented in media.
This indicates that apical exposure could be more detrimental
than basolateral exposure. This occurred despite the fact that
the concentration of nicotine was actually higher in the media
(10 μM)
compared
with
the
ASL
(60–120 nM)
of
the
aerosol-exposed cells. This would suggest that inhaled nicotine
impacts on the lungs differently than nicotine circulating in the
body. However, further studies are needed to compare the pul-
monary consequences of inhaled nicotine versus nicotine

 absorbed systemically though products like nicotine patches.
Though nicotine acts via α7nAchR to stimulate PKCα (see
figure 9 for potential signalling), it remains to be determined
how much PKCα activation contributed to the pathogenic
changes that occurred in our lung models. Indeed, identifying
the signalling mechanisms responsible for these nicotine-
mediated effects will be a key goal of future studies.

responses.7 8 To date, no other studies have looked at the effects
of chronic e-cigarette exposure on lung inflammation in mice.
Unlike our study and the study by Lerner et al,7 Sussan et al8
did not identify increases in IL-6 or MCP-1 in response to
e-cigarette exposure but this may be accounted for by differ-
ences in mouse background, exposure time, e-cigarette flavour-
ing, cotinine levels in plasma and the presence of a pulmonary
infection.8 In ova-albumin sensitised mice, a 10-week e-cigarette
exposure was reported to increase airway hyper-reactivity38 and

 we found that chronic e-cigarette inhalation, by itself, induces
airway hyper-reactivity. Similar to cigarette smoke, nicotine in
e-cigarettes promotes airway smooth muscle proliferation and
contraction,
which
can
impact
airway
hyper-reactivity
in
exposed individuals.39 Thus, nicotine could be a key factor
driving the onset and progression of lung disease.
Commercially available, nicotine-free, vehicle was used as a
control for the nicotine-containing e-cigarette liquid. With the
exception of nicotine, the composition of these two liquids was
identical. W
e chose to investigate a vehicle (50:50 PG:VG) that
is commonly used by e-cigarette users. To avoid potential con-
founding effects, we also elected to use a vehicle that did not
contain flavouring since the additives in e-cigarette flavourings
induce significant oxidative and inflammatory responses in lung
cells and tissues.7 This study observed no deleterious effects of
the vehicle, but the authors cannot rule out the potential long-
term side effects of components in a wide variety of commer-
cially available e-liquids. Indeed, recent e-cigarette studies found
substantial detectable levels of toxic metals, such as aluminium,
copper, zinc, lead and chromium.40
In summary, these results show the adverse lung health effects
of chronic e-cigarette exposure. In addition, they establish that
nicotine is the key component that causes airway hyper-
reactivity and lung tissue destruction. e-Cigarettes contain far
fewer carcinogens and are less likely to promote carcinogenesis.
Thus, though e-cigarettes may have a better safety profile,
refraining from nicotine inhalation will likely impact on preserv-
ing lung health.
