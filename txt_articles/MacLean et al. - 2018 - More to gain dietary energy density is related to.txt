Abstract
Background: Given the current prevalence of both cigarette use and obesity in the United States, identification of
dietary patterns that reduce mortality risk are important public health priorities. The objective of the present study
was to evaluate the correlation between cigarette use and dietary energy density, a marker for diet quality, in a
population of current smokers, former smokers, and never smokers.
Methods: Data from a nationally representative sample of 5293 adults who participated in the 2013–2014 National
Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES) were analyzed. Specific survey procedures were used in the
analysis to account for sample weights, unequal selection probability, and clustered design when evaluating the
association between dietary energy density (ED, energy per weight of food, kcal/g) and current smoking status.
Never smokers reported < 100 lifetime cigarettes. Smokers were identified as individuals reporting > 100 lifetime
cigarettes and current smoking status was recorded as daily, some days (nondaily), or not at all (former).
Results: A strong linear relationship was observed between smoking pattern and dietary ED in current smokers.
Compared to never smokers, daily smokers and nondaily smokers have significantly higher dietary ED (1.79 vs. 2.02
and 1.88, respectively; both p < 0.05); demonstrating that any amount of current cigarette consumption is
associated with poor diet. Though former smokers had a higher dietary ED than never smokers, this difference still
significantly lower than that of current smokers (p = 0.002).
Conclusion: These findings suggest that smoking status is associated with poor diet quality. Former smokers had a
slightly lower ED value (1.84) than current non-daily smokers (1.89) but a higher value than never smokers (1.79).

Background
Smoking is the leading cause of preventable mortality and
is associated with a variety of chronic illnesses including
cardiovascular disease (CVD), cancer, and stroke [1, 2].
Although nearly 7 in 10 adult cigarette smokers want to
quit [3], cessation rates remain alarmingly low. For ex-
ample, the percentage of smokers reporting a serious quit
attempt has significantly increased in recent years from
51.2% in 2011 to 55.0% in 2014; however, successful ab-
stinence has remained unchanged at approximately 20%
during the same period [4]. Notably, the number of ser-
ious quit attempts is well below the 80% objective outlined
in Healthy People 2020 [5]. Therefore, additional efforts
are needed to increase the number of people making a
serious quit attempt and, by proxy, decrease the impact
and incidence of chronic medical conditions associated
with smoking. Evaluation of modifiable risk factors that
are associated with cigarette smoking can help identify tar-
gets that are amendable to intervention.
Along with smoking, poor diet is in the top three modi-
fiable risk factors for CVD [6]. Poor diet is a primary
determinant of obesity; however, cigarette smoking is
negatively associated with obesity, potentially due to the
pharmacological effects of nicotine [7]. Despite lower rates
of obesity, cigarette smokers have worse diets that are low
in essential nutrients compared to nonsmokers and
former smokers [8, 9]. A large meta-analytic study com-
paring smokers (n = 35,870) to nonsmokers (n = 47,250)
across 51 studies revealed that smokers reported greater

 intakes of energy, total and saturated fat, and cholesterol;
while reporting lower intakes of antioxidant vitamins and
fiber [10]. Fruits and vegetables are low energy foods that
contain high levels of antioxidant vitamins and fiber, so it
is not surprising that multiple studies report lower fruit
and vegetable consumption among smokers [8, 11–13].
Therefore, a diet quality measure that highlights fruit and
vegetable intake and is associated with chronic disease may
provide inroads to evaluation and treatment of cigarette
smokers.
Dietary energy density (ED, kcal/g) is an established
risk factor for obesity and other forms of chronic disease
[14, 15]. From a public health perspective, recommenda-
tions to consume a diet low in energy density has been
recognized by national and international public health or-
ganizations, including the 2015 Dietary Guidelines for
Americans, which recommends a low-ED diet as a strat-
egy for prevention of obesity, and as a method of weight
control [16]. Diets low in energy density have been charac-
terized as higher in specific low-ED foods, such as fruits
and vegetables, and higher in overall diet quality [17–19].
Furthermore, research has suggested that a diet that in-
cludes greater consumption of low energy dense foods is
associated with a reduction in CVD risk [20, 21].
Diet quality is a comprehensive evaluation of overall
dietary intake. Previous studies have demonstrated that
dietary ED to be a marker for diet quality in both chil-
dren and adults, as well as an established risk factor for
obesity [17–19, 22] though not when looking specifically
at a population of smokers. The relationship between
dietary energy density, diet quality, and smoking behav-
iors is not well understood. To our knowledge, only one
study has assessed overall diet quality and smoking
status. Alkerwi and colleagues [23] evaluated smoking
status and overall diet quality as measured by eight diet
quality indices, including overall energy density, using
the Observation of Cardiovascular Risk Factors in Luxem-
burg (ORISCAV-LUX) survey. Notably, the authors divided
smoking status into never smokers, former smokers, non-
daily smokers, moderate smokers, and heavy smokers. The
authors found that overall diet quality between never
smokers, former smokers, and nondaily smokers are largely
equivalent. Conversely, compared to never smokers, mod-
erate and heavy smokers were less compliant with dietary
recommendations and heavy smokers reported less diver-
sity in food choices; the overall ED score was not signifi-
cantly different [23]. These findings acknowledge the
complex nature of dietary intake across varying levels of
smoking behavior.
Much of the previous literature on diet and smoking has
focused on specific food types and not indicators of diet
quality that can readily translate to clinical intervention.
The current study addresses this knowledge gap by evaluat-
ing the relationship between dietary ED and smoking status
in US adults. To date, no studies of this nature have evalu-
ated the relationship between dietary energy density and
smoking status in a US population. The types of foods con-
sumed influence the overall dietary energy density. As pre-
viously reported, the most commonly consumed low-ED
foods by this population diet include: orange vegetables,
dark green leafy vegetables, fruit, salad, rice, and pasta; the
most commonly consumed high-ED foods include: potato
chips, savory crackers, cookies, processed cheese, and white
bread [24]. A previous meta-analysis has demonstrated the
robust relationship between consumption of low-ED fruits
and vegetables and lower risk for mortality, particularly
CVD mortality [25]. As a marker for both diet quality and a
risk factor for obesity, dietary ED is an important compo-
nent of understanding disorders associated with poor diet,
including CVD and cancer, particularly in a population of
smokers.
Methods
Study population & data collection
The study was conducted using data from a national repre-
sentative sample of US Adults (> 18 y) who participated in
the 2013–2014 National Health and Examination Survey
(NHANES). The NHANES is a large cross-sectional survey
conducted by both the Centers for Disease Control (CDC)
and the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) that
monitors the health and nutrition status of the non-
institutionalized
US
residents.
During
the
NHANES,
subjects receive a comprehensive health evaluation and an-
swer a variety of surveys, including behavioral question-
naires
about dietary habits
and smoking behaviors.
Participants provide written consent. Complete details
about NHANES survey components, survey methodology,
and sampling procedures are available from the CDC
NHANES website [26]. The NHANES analytic dataset
includes demographic information about participants, in-
cluding age at the time of exam, education level, physical
activity level (measured in MET units), race/ethnicity and
socioeconomic status were all provided in the NHANES
data. Socioeconomic status was quantified as a continuous
variable using poverty-income ratio (PIR), or the ratio of
family income to family-size specific poverty threshold.
Assessment of smoking status
During the NHANES, individuals are asked questions
related to smoking status, duration, and smoking-related
behaviors. Smoking status was assessed in the home, by
trained interviewers using the Computer-Assisted Per-
sonal Interviewing System (CAPI). Use of the CAPI allows
for increases in reporting accuracy. Participants responded
to whether they currently smoke cigarettes daily, some
days, or not at all. Participants were categorized as never-
smokers (individuals who have smoked <100cig/lifetime),
former smokers (having smoked >100cig/lifetime but do

 not currently smoke), and current smokers. Current
smokers are further classified as daily smokers (smoking
cigarettes every day) and nondaily smokers (identifies as a
smoker, but does not smoke cigarettes every day).
Assessment of dietary intake
NHANES dietary data is collected as part of the What
We Eat In America survey [27]. Participants provide 1
day of dietary recall data, obtained by a trained inter-
viewer using Automated Multi-Pass Method as part of
the in-person medical examination. Specific status codes
were provided in the NHANES data set to indicate the
quality, reliability, and completeness of the dietary data.
The USDA 2013–2014 Food and Nutrient Database for
Dietary Studies (FNDDS) was used to process the
NHANES dietary data, including micronutrient intake.
Dietary Energy Density (ED) was calculated by dividing
the energy content (in kcal) by weight of food (in g) con-
sumed, excluding all beverages. Complete details of this
method of calculating energy density in a nationally rep-
resentative sample have been previous described [28]. In
order to account for the potentially significant contribu-
tion of beverages to the total diet, beverage ED is calcu-
lated separately and used as a covariate in statistical
models. This method of energy density calculation
(foods only, controlling for beverage ED) is frequently
used, in particular by studies showing robust relation-
ships between dietary ED and disease status [15, 24, 28].
Statistical analysis
For the present analyses, we initially included all adults
age 18 and older (n = 5535) that provided complete
smoking and dietary data. Women who were pregnant,
and individuals with unreliable dietary data (as indicated
in the NHANES or individuals reporting consuming no
foods or beverages during the 24HR) were excluded,
resulting in a final analytical dataset of 5293 adults. All
data were analyzed using SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute,
Cary, NC) using appropriate survey weights and proce-
dures to account for the NHANES unequal probability
sampling strategy and clustered design. Multivariable
regression models were used to evaluate the relationship
between smoking status and dietary energy density. All
models were adjusted for age, sex, race, education, socio-
economic status (PIR, poverty:income ratio), physical ac-
tivity (MET-min, standardized metabolic equivalent units),
beverage energy density, and body mass index. A test for
linear trend using the Wald statistic was performed by
modeling smoking status as a continuous variable.
Results
Table 1 shows the demographic characteristics of the
study population. Few differences in demographic char-
acteristics were identified. Current daily smokers tend to
have a lower socioeconomic status than never smokers
and former smokers. It is notable that current nondaily
smokers tend to be younger, and former smokers tend
to be older than either never smokers or current daily
smokers. Weight status distribution was relatively simi-
lar across all smoking categories, though former smokers
have a higher BMI than never smokers. Interestingly,
both never smokers and current nondaily smokers were
more physically active than current daily smokers and
former smokers.
Mean dietary energy density (ED, kcal/g) after adjusting
for age, sex, race, educational attainment, socioeconomic
status, beverage energy density, physical activity and BMI
is presented in Fig. 1. Compared to never smokers, daily
smokers and nondaily smokers have significantly higher
dietary energy density (1.79 ± 0.02 kcal/g vs. 2.02 ±
0.03 kcal/g and 1.89 ± 0.05 kcal/g, respectively); demon-
strating that any amount of current cigarette consumption
is associated with poor diet. Though former smokers had
a higher dietary ED (1.84 ± 0.03 kcal/g) than never
smokers (p = 0.04), former smokers dietary ED is still
significantly lower than that of current smokers (p =
0.002), and did not differ from nondaily smokers. The dif-
ference in energy density indicates that on average,
current daily smokers consume approximately 200 cal
more per day than never smokers, despite eating signifi-
cantly smaller portions of food.
Discussion
The present study assesses the relationship between
smoking status and dietary behaviors. Using a nationally
representative sample of US adults, we observed an in-
verse relationship between dietary ED and smoking sta-
tus. Given the prominence of ED in national dietary
guidelines and the established low intake of fruits and
vegetables in smokers, dietary ED offers an effective in-
dicator of diet quality that is amenable to intervention in
smokers. Although the recent European study did not
report differences in ED [23], the results of the present
study highlight a similar negative correlation between
smoking status and dietary quality. Both the present
study and the European study evaluated smoking status
using
various
categorizations of
smokers, including
former smokers. Evaluation of dietary ED among never
smokers, former smokers, and current smokers indicates
that former smokers have diets similar to never smokers,
and better diets than current daily smokers.
The results from the present study also provide an update
to the literature demonstrating that dietary behavior among
smokers differs substantially from never smokers [29, 30],
particularly for ED. A diet high in ED is characterized by
comparatively lower consumption of fruits and vegetables.
This is consistent with previous reports that smokers have
lower serum Vitamin C levels and higher levels of Vitamin

 C turnover than non-smokers, despite an increased need
for Vitamin C and other antioxidants [31]. Currently, the
Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) for Vitamin C
for non-smokers range from 75 to 90 mg per day depend-
ing on gender, with smokers requiring an additional 35 mg
per day [32], and recent reports indicate that Vitamin C in-
take requirements may actually be higher [33]. Increases in
smoking-generated oxidative stress and decreases intakes of
Vitamin C and β-carotene confer additional risk for CVD
and cancer [34], presenting a major public health concern.
Evaluation of specific nutrients is challenging to translate
into a concrete intervention for regular smokers, particu-
larly because recent publications indicate that antioxidant
supplementation is not a recommended strategy for disease
prevention [35, 36]. Therefore, understanding dietary pat-
terns using a whole-diet approach may better allow for
identification of strategies to target for intervention.
Dietary ED is a comprehensive evaluation of overall
diet, as it is calculated based on both the weight and
energy content of foods consumed. Both low-ED and
high-ED diets have been well categorized in the litera-
ture [14, 17, 18, 24, 37]. Diets low in ED allow individ-
uals to consume larger quantities of food for fewer
calories; essentially eating satisfying portion sizes without
caloric excess. Low-ED diets are also higher in diet quality
[17–19, 22], and typically contain more antioxidant-rich
fruits and vegetables, both of which are important factors
for reduction of disease risk in smokers. Additionally, diet
quality is an important predictor of post-cessation weight
gain in US adults, as indicated by a 2010 analysis of data
from the Framingham Heart Study Offspring Cohort [38].
Using dietary ED as a marker for diet quality may provide
insight as to the rationale for the findings in the Framing-
ham study. The findings in the present study that former

 smokers have diets lower in energy density than current
smokers may suggest that successful cessation may be
linked to prevention of weight gain, though the cross-
sectional analysis does not allow for causal inferences to be
determined. Consuming a diet low in energy density is a
recommended strategy for preventing weight gain [16], and
since concerns about weight gain may delay quit attempts
[39], development of specific dietary strategies to lower
dietary ED may be a valuable component of a successful
smoking cessation program. Substituting higher-ED foods
with low-ED, antioxidant-rich fruits and vegetables will help
address micronutrient deficits associated with smoking and
improve overall diet quality.
There are several strengths to the present study. Analysis
of NHANES data produces results that are generalizable to
the US population. The NHANES provides the unique op-
portunity to evaluate public health issues related to diet
and smoking behaviors. The unique survey design of the
NHANES allows for estimation of mean of the population’s
distribution of usual dietary intake, strengthening confi-
dence in the results presented [40]. In addition, the present
study includes two distinct categories of smokers: nondaily
smokers and daily smokers. Inclusion of both types of
smokers allows for greater identification of dietary patterns
that may be potential targets for cessation intervention.
Despite recent declines in daily smoking, nondaily smokers
are on the rise [1] and demonstrate similar difficulty quit-
ting as daily smokers [41, 42]. Our results demonstrate that
former smokers have better quality diets than current
smokers, including those who only smoke occasionally,
indicating that dietary guidance may be an important com-
ponent of cessation programs for all smokers. Poor diet in
smokers is consistent with other negative health behaviors
often associated with smoking including sedentary behavior
[43], alcohol consumption [44], and poor physical fitness
[45]. The study also presents some limitations. First, dietary
data is based on 24-h recall, and may be subject to bias.
However, dietary data in the NHANES is collected using
the USDA’s Automated Multiple-Pass Method (AMPM)
with quality control procedures in place during the data
collection phase can address this potential concern [40].
Finally, the cross-sectional nature of the NHANES allows
for evaluation of correlation, but not causality.
Conclusions
Our findings demonstrate an association between dietary
energy and smoking status. Despite reports that, com-
pared to never smokers, smokers have lower prevalence
of obesity; however, our results demonstrate a negative
linear relationship between smoking status and dietary
ED. The results also demonstrate that though former
smokers have a higher dietary ED than never smokers, they
have better diets than current smokers, including those that
only smoke occasionally. As dietary ED is a marker for both
diet quality and risk factor weight-related problems, con-
sumption of a diet low in ED may be a successful strategy
for preventing weight gain following smoking cessation.
Dietary recommendations based on ED are easy to imple-
ment and permit consumption of a variety of foods that are
amenable to multiple personal and cultural preferences. In
order to lower dietary ED, individuals must consume a
greater proportion of low-ED foods, including fruits, vege-
tables, soups, and rice while reducing consumption of high-
ED foods such as salty snacks and sweets. Diets lower in
energy density contain larger portions of food for fewer cal-
ories, and are associated with higher levels of post-meal
satiety [46]. Interventions that educate smokers about diet-
ary ED in order to enable them to make educated dietary

more to evaluate associations between diet quality and
