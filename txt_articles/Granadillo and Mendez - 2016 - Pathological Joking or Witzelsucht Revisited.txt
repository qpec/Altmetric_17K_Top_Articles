Abstract
Humor, or the perception or elicitation of mirth and funniness, is distinguishable from laughter and 
can be differentially disturbed by neuropsychiatric disease. We present two patients with constant 
joking, or Witzelsucht, in the absence of pseudobulbar affect and review the literature on 
pathological humor. These patients had involvement of frontal structures, impaired appreciation of 
non-simple humor, and a compulsion for disinhibited joking. Current neuroscience suggests 
impaired humor integration from right lateral frontal injury and disinhibition from orbitofrontal 
damage results in disinhibited humor preferentially activating limbic and subcortical reward 
centers. Additional frontal-subcortical circuit dysfunction may promote pathological joking as a 
compulsion.
INTRODUCTION
… So with the mind, something unexpected—a novel or incongruous idea which 
breaks through an habitual train of thought—appears to be a strong element in the 
ludicrous. (Darwin, 1872) {(1)}
Compared to other animals, humans are uniquely endowed with the ability to detect, 
decipher, and delight in humor. Charles Darwin and others suggested an evolutionary 
significance for the experiencing of something as funny or for finding something amusing 
{1}. An evolutionary basis compels a neurobiological explanation of humor, and suggests 
that disturbances in humor can result from neuropsychiatric disease. Importantly, humor is 
not the same as laughter. Although humor tends to elicit laughter, the processes for humor 
are distinct from the ability to laugh and, hence, from pseudobulbar affect (PBA) or 
pathological laughter in neurological disease {2, 3}.
Humor is a broad term that refers to anything that people say or do that is considered funny 
and that tends to make others laugh. Humor also includes the neurocognitive mechanisms 
for creating and perceiving humor and for responding to it with amusement {4}. The

 concept of “funny” is more limited and refers to anything that can lead to laughter, mirth, or 
amusement. In neuropsychiatric disease, humor is often impaired and, although usually 
decreased, in some conditions it leads to abnormal and compulsive joking, punning, or 
pranks.
We present two patients with brain disorders and alterations in the sense of humor 
characterized by intractable joking, and we review the growing neuroscience literature 
pertinent to this phenomenon. One patient had right frontal encephalomalacia plus a stroke 
of the left caudate, and the other had behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) 
and prominent right frontal Pick bodies on autopsy. These patients had Witzelsucht, or 
excessive and often inappropriate joking and facetious humor {5}, and moria of Jastrowitz, 
or a childish or silly excitement {6}. Previously described from brain tumors, strokes, 
infections, and other lesions involving the frontal lobe, particularly the right orbitofrontal 
region {7}, Witzelsucht and moria can also be prominent manifestations of behavioral 
variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) {8, 9}.
CASE REPORT No. 1
A 69 year-old right-handed man presented for a neuropsychiatric evaluation because of a 5-
year history of compulsive joking. Ten years prior to presentation, he had a subarachnoid 
hemorrhage (SAH) of undetermined etiology. The SAH was complicated by hydrocephalus, 
placement of a right ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt, and a small area of perishunt 
encephalomalacia in the right frontal region (Figure 1a). Afterwards, he was left with a 
personality change. He became compulsive, with a fixation on recycling to the point where 
he would go through dumpsters searching for recyclable items, and he developed hoarding 
behaviors, collecting napkins and utensils from restaurants and other locations.
Five years after this event, he again had a fairly abrupt behavioral change, this time with the 
development of constant joking along with disinhibition. He became affectionate towards 
younger females, hugging them for “too long”, made borderline offensive comments, and 
took candy from stores without paying, getting caught on several occasions. A repeat 
neurological evaluation with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a new lacunar 
stroke in the head of the left caudate nucleus (Figure 1b).
On interview, the patient reported feeling generally joyful, but his compulsive need to make 
jokes and create humor had become an issue of contention with his wife. He would wake her 
up in the middle of the night bursting out in laughter, just to tell her about the jokes he had 
come up with. Upon the request of his wife, he started writing down these jokes as a way to 
avoid waking her; he brought to our office approximately 50 pages filled with his jokes, 
most of which were either puns or silly jokes with a sexual or scatological content (Table 1). 
His past medical history was positive for prior depression, absent for the preceding 10 years.
On examination, he had frequent episodes of joking with prominent laughter. Although he 
would laugh at his own jokes or witticisms, his laughter was neither uncontrollable nor 
involuntary. His Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score was 29/30 (missed one 
recall item). The language examination was normal, and he generated a list of 25 animals/

 minute and 24 “F” words/minute (including expletives). On memory testing he was able to 
recall 7 out of 10 words on 15-minute delayed recall. He was intact on calculations, praxis, 
and frontal system tasks, but he misplaced the hands on a clock drawing test. He was normal 
on idiom and proverb interpretation, and he had full insight into his excessive joking 
behavior and humor. His neurological examination was remarkable for some difficulty with 
tandem gait manifested as a subtle loss of balance. Neuropsychological testing showed 
difficulties in frontal-executive functions, such as response inhibition, self-monitoring, and 
task-monitoring.
On further testing, he showed increased humor production, normal identification of humor in 
jokes, but a decreased affective appreciation of “funniness”. On a 24-point self-descriptive 
scale for sense of humor, the patient’s scores suggested significantly elevated humor 
creativity. On the “Joke and Story Completion Test”, a multiple choice test of humor 
appreciation {10, 11}, the patient was able to correctly identify the punchlines of 16 jokes. 
Despite his correct recognition of the funny endings, he did not laugh or report them as 
feeling funny. Additional testing with other jokes confirmed the same ability to identify the 
funny line but without laughing or experiencing it as funny.
He did not respond to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) medications and 
trazodone, but he had a partial response to dextromethorphan 20mg/quinidine 10 mg titrated 
to twice a day. On this medication, the patient had a significant reduction in the frequency 
and duration of his episodes of laughter but without any effects on his compulsive need to 
constantly make and tell jokes. He remained stable, without progression, on this regimen.
CASE REPORT No. 2
A 57-year-old right-handed man presented for evaluation of a three-year history of the 
insidious onset and progression of behavioral changes. The patient had become a “jokester”, 
always making childish jokes or comments and laughing easily at his own comments. He 
had also become disinhibited, saying or doing things that were inappropriate and 
demonstrating excessive familiarity with strangers. He lost his job after blurting out, “Who 
the hell chose this God-awful place?” In addition, without invitations, he would walk into his 
coworkers’ offices and defrag their computers and walk into a neighbor’s home and play 
their piano.
Further changes included prominent compulsive behavior along with dietary changes and a 
decline in his hygiene. His wife found dozens of coffee grinders and almost two dozen 
Hawaiian shirts accumulated in their garage. He had changes in his eating behavior where he 
would eat the exact same thing over and over again and became obsessed with certain fast 
foods. At one point he had not bathed for at least six weeks and when he was asked to do so, 
his response was, “Chinese people don’t have body odor” (he was of Asian descent). Past 
medical history was negative except for an appendectomy and tonsillectomy, and his family 
history was otherwise unremarkable.
On examination, he would frequently break out in laughter, almost cackling, at his own 
comments, opinions, or jokes, many of which were borderline sexual or political in content.

 On the MMSE, he scored 29 out of 30, missing only the exact day of the week. Language 
was fluent with good auditory comprehension, repetition, and confrontational naming. He 
generated a word list of 20 animals in a minute and 19 “F” words in a minute. On memory 
testing, he got 0 out of 10 words spontaneously at 15 minutes, but all 10 on a recognition 
task. He had very good memory for current events. The patient had normal performances on 
visuospatial, simple calculation, and ideomotor praxis tasks. He was concrete on some 
proverb interpretations, and he showed no insight into his disease or behavioral changes. 
Neuropsychological testing found executive deficits and decreased memory retrieval. The 
rest of the neurologic examination was normal.
This patient had progressive behavioral changes consistent with bvFTD. Although his MRI 
was within normal limits, brain single photon emission tomography (SPECT) imaging 
showed relative frontal hypoperfusion (Figure 2). On subsequent follow-up visits, he 
continued to make frequent comments and jokes, at times acting quite silly, childish, and 
inappropriate. For example, on one clinic visit he began disco dancing; on another he 
publicly discussed his sexual situation; and at a third visit he grabbed the examiner’s tie and 
that of a passing physician and started to compare them. Throughout these behaviors, the 
patient would quickly lapse into laughter. Yet, he did not laugh or consider funny any jokes 
or witticisms presented to him, despite being able to recognize most of the punchlines. He 
remained jovial despite trials of SSRI medications, and he continued to deteriorate in 
cognition and developed parkinsonism.
The patient died 11-12 years into his course, and his autopsy showed Pick’s disease (a form 
of bvFTD). He had asymmetric frontotemporal atrophy, severe in frontal lobes and moderate 
in temporal lobes, affecting the right more than the left side. He had tau-immunoreactive 
intracytoplasmic inclusions consistent with Pick bodies in neurons involving frontal and 
temporal neocortex, along with associated overwhelming neuronal loss and severe gliosis.
DISCUSSION
“Humor can be dissected as a frog can, but the thing dies in the process and the 
innards are discouraging to any but the pure scientific mind.” (E.B. White, 1941) 
{12}
These two patients had pathological humor or compulsive need for joking from bifrontal 
dysfunction, most critically from involvement of the right frontal lobe. Both patients had 
bifrontal damage, suggesting that both right and left frontal involvement is necessary for 
pathological humor. In the first case it followed a stroke in the head of the left caudate 
nucleus, an area which mediates frontosubcortical tracts, in a patient with prior compulsive 
behavior associated with right frontal encephalomalacia. The other patient had bvFTD with 
right greater than left frontotemporal Pick’s disease on neuropathology. Both patients were 
consumed with a compulsive tendency for disinhibited jokes to the point of disturbing their 
families and others. On examination, both were able to detect jokes and identify them as 
funny, but they did not experience or feel others’ jokes as funny or amusing. In essence, their 
humor was entirely internally-driven.

 These patients’ compulsive need to make inappropriate jokes and to act childishly are 
consistent with “Witzelsucht”, from the German words for joke (Witz) and addiction 
(Sucht), and “moria”, or inappropriate cheerfulness. In the late 1880’s, Herman Oppenheim 
described an addiction to trivial, excessive and often sarcastic joking among four patients 
with right frontal lobe tumors {5}, and Moritz Jastrowitz described silly and excited 
behavior in a patient with a large right frontal tumor {6}. At the time, neuropathological 
studies of patients with similar acquired changes in personality showed involvement of the 
orbitofrontal and mesial frontal regions bilaterally, but particularly on the right {13}. More 
recent reports have also emphasized involvement of the right hemisphere with Witzelsucht 
{14}. The paradox of Witzelsucht and moria is that these patients are actually insensitive to 
non-self generated humor. Even when they recognize and understand a joke, they do not 
affectively respond with a sense of mirth or with laughter. In other words, they do not feel 
the punchline as humorously connected to the storyline, yet simple forms of humor that do 
not require integration of a punchline, such as slapstick and puns, may still be experienced 
as funny.
There are many neuropsychiatric causes of pathological humor or Witzelsucht. Frontal 
lesions, like those described in our two patients, may result from brain trauma and other 
neurodegenerative diseases as well as from focal lesions. Dementias, particularly if 
frontally-predominant, can increase the production of humor, as well as decrease the sense 
of humor. In particular, patients with bvFTD, especially if right predominant, may have a 
tendency to Witzelsucht, moria, slapstick, scatological jokes or compulsive punning, along 
with decreased comprehension of complex or unfamiliar humor {8, 9, 15}. There are also 
developmental or genetic causes for pathological humor, such as Angelman or the “happy 
puppet’ syndrome, Williams syndrome, and Down’s syndrome. In autism, although there is 
deficient humor processing linked to social or socioemotional aspects of humor, there can be 
a prominently retained predilection for physical humor and slapstick.
On initial presentation, clinicians must distinguish pathological humor or Witzelsucht from 
pathological laughter or pseudobulbar affect (PBA) {2, 3}. PBA may result in episodic, 
paroxysmal laughing, crying or mixed, from release of the dorsal upper pons laughter-
coordinating center by bilateral upper motor neuron disease from strokes, amyotrophic 
lateral sclerosis, multiple sclerosis, traumatic brain injury, Parkinson’s Disease, multisystem 
atrophy, or progressive supranuclear palsy {2}. PBA is distinguishable from pathological 
humor in that its laughter is triggered by trivial or minimal stimuli and is often excessive and 
incongruent with the underlying mood and the extent of the patient’s emotional experience. 
A related unilateral condition is “fou rire prodromique”, or unmotivated, inappropriate, 
uncontrollable hearty laughter as the first symptom of cerebral ischemia that affects the 
inhibitory neurons for laughter in ventral pons, left internal capsule-thalamus, left basal 
ganglia, or left parahipppocampal gyrus. Finally, epilepsy and electrical stimulation can lead 
to gelastic seizures or brief, stereotyped (mechanical, unnatural) epileptic laughter, usually 
from the left hypothalamic hamartomas, hypothalamic extension of other tumors, or left 
frontal or temporal lobe foci {16–18}.
Understanding the origin and nature of humor facilitates understanding the origin of 
pathological humor. In observing the relaxed, open-mouth display in primates during rough-

 and-tumble play in chimpanzees, Darwin suggested that a novel or incongruous experience 
that surprises but is not a real threat leads to humor {19}. In a psychoanalytic elaboration of 
this idea, Sigmund Freud suggested that humor is an attitude (defense) by which people 
refuse to suffer by emphasizing the invincibility of their egos to provocation or reality {20}. 
It involves the superego in the moment of humor reassuring the ego that the world is not 
dangerous, an occasion to gain pleasure and reassert the pleasure principle. Several 
subsequent theories propose that humor is a “stress antagonist” able to enhance the immune, 
cardiovascular and endocrine systems and decrease stress-induced cortisol levels {21–23}; a 
signal detector of “false alarms” that communicates non-threatening deviations from the 
rules or mistakes in reasoning {24, 25}; a mechanism for social gain, promoting social 
exploration {26, 27}, social superiority {27}, or even sexual selection of a mate {26, 28, 
29}. All of these theories, however, lack a neurocognitive explanation.
The most prominent neurocognitive theory of humor is the “Incongruity Theory” (Figure 3), 
which begins with detection and resolution of conflicting alternatives in the frontal lobes 
followed by humor appreciation in pleasure/reward areas {30–32}. First, one must “get the 
joke” (humor comprehension), which involves detection of the incongruity of the punchline 
with the joke. The experience of surprise signals that the joke expectations are incongruent 
with the punchline. Surprise then precipitates a search for alternative explanations, or 
incongruity resolution. The arrival at a new explanation is the trigger to humor elaboration 
or appreciation, the emotionally pleasurable responses that are experienced as amusement or 
laughter {10, 24, 30, 31, 33}.
Neuroscience and functional neuroimaging suggest that many brain regions can be involved 
in the incongruity theory of humor {26, 31, 34, 35}. It is likely that both left and right 
frontal lobes have a role in incongruity detection and incongruity resolution, with the left 
frontal lobe more responsive to simple humor and the right engaged with more externally-
generated, complex humor {30, 34}. Simple humor engages the left frontal lobe [the inferior 
frontal gyri (IFG)], with input from the medial temporal gyri (MTG) {11,15, 32, 36}. 
Examples of “simple humor” include the early detection of basic norm violations and 
plausibility, physical humor, slapstick, puns, familiar humor, and congruent but unfunny 
endings. Complicated humor, such as verbal semantic jokes requiring reconciliation with 
stored knowledge, also activates the right frontal and right MTG regions {38, 39}. In 
addition, humor that specifically involves deviations from social expectations engages the 
left frontal lobe [the superior frontal gyri (SFG)] and the temporoparietal junction (TPJ) on 
the right {26, 35, 37}, part of the circuitry involved in taking another’s perspective, or 
Theory of Mind (ToM). Finally, investigators agree that all types of humor require the right 
frontal lobe, including the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and adjacent anterior 
cingulate cortex (ACC) for surprise when something is unexpected {26, 40}, and the 
triggering of humor appreciation through frontal connections with limbic (insulae, 
amygdalae) and dopaminergic reward (nucleus accumbens, ventral striatum) areas {26, 30–
32, 38, 41, 42}.
Although bifrontal injury is usually present, damage to the right frontal lobe appears critical 
for pathological humor. Patients with right frontal lesions remain sensitive to simple jokes, 
slapstick, or puns {43, 44}, but they are impaired in appreciating externally-generated, non-

 simple, or novel jokes. They may not appreciate the relationship of their punchlines to their 
storylines and do not experience their funniness, prefering non-funny endings {10, 11, 43–
45}. Hence, patients with right frontal lesions, like those with bvFTD {15}, are prone to 
simple, silly jokes {46}. These findings suggest that damage to the right dorsolateral/
ventrolateral frontal lobe, possibly SFG but also MFG and IFG, impairs the integration of 
externally-generated humor so that it can be experienced as funny {35, 36, 45, 47}. In 
patients with the joking disease, concomitant disinhibition from orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) 
damage {48} permits self-generated and disinhibited jokes, rather than externally-generated 
humor, to be the main trigger of limbic and reward areas for humor appreciation, implying a 
self vs. other referential network for humor, as in ToM. Moreover, these patients appear 
compulsively driven to make jokes, suggesting additional damage to frontal (OFC-ACC)-
striatal circuits involved in inhibitory control {49}.
There are no evidence-based pharmacological treatments for pathological humor, but 
published data on the treatment of disinhibition in different psychiatric and neurological 
conditions may apply to the treatmento of patients with Witzelsucht. The first medications to 
try are the SSRI’s, which were unsuccessful in decreasing pathological humor in these two 
patients, followed by psychoactive antiseizure medications such as valproate, 
carbamazepine, and lamotrigine. The use of dextromethorphan/quindine, a combination 
indicated for pathological laugther, may reduce the amount of laughter without altering the 
need for humor, as was the case with our first patient. Finally, when these medications fail 
and further treatment trials are indicated, clinicians may resort to low dose atypical 
antipsychotics to relieve the impact of the pathological humor {50}.
We conclude that pathological humor is a compulsion for disinhibited humor. In our first 
patient, the compulsive drive developed after the initial right frontal lesion, but the focus of 
his compulsions on disinhibited jokes did not occur until after OFC-subcortical tract 
dysfunction from his left caudate stroke. Both patients had decreased appreciation of 
externally-generated jokes associated with right lateral frontal dysfunction, and a compulsive 
drive for disinhibited, self-generated joking and humor associated with OFC disease {51, 
52}. Future research can further clarify the mechanism and suggest management of 
Witzelsucht and moria in neuropsychiatric disease.

Brain MRI scan (FLAIR sequences). A) Right trans-frontal ventriculoperitoneal shunt, with 
the tip in the region of the right foramen of Monro. There is a focus of hypodensity in the 
right frontal lobe, including the superior frontal gyrus (SFG) and extending to the anterior 
body of the right lateral ventricle. It is adjacent to a small right frontal surgical burr-hole. B) 
More recent lacunar infarction in the head of the left caudate nucleus, a structure that 
mediates frontal-subcortical tracts.

Arrow No. 1: Incongruity detection and resolution leads to humor elaboration, i.e., getting 
the joke and triggering amusement, respectively.
Pathological Humor: Right frontal defect in humor resolution and/or appreciation plus 
compulsive, disinhibited humor from bilateral OFC lesion.

STORYLINE
PUNCHLINE
1) How do you cure hunger?
Step away from the buffet table.
2) What is a pill-popping sexual molester guilty of?
Rape and pillage.
3) What did the proctologist say to his therapist?
All day long I am dealing with A**holes.
4) Went to the Department of Motor Vehicles to get my driver’s license. They 
gave me an eye exam and here is what they said:
ABCDEFG, HIJKMNLOP, QRS, TUV, WXY and Z; now I 
know my ABC’s, can I have my license please.
