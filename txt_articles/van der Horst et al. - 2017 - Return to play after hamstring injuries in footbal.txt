AbstrAct
There are three major questions about return to play 
(RTP) after hamstring injuries: How should RTP be 
defined? Which medical criteria should support the 
RTP decision? And who should make the RTP decision? 
The study aimed to provide a clear RTP definition and 
medical criteria for RTP and to clarify RTP consultation 
and responsibilities after hamstring injury. The study 
used the Delphi procedure. The results of a systematic 
review were used as a starting point for the Delphi 
procedure. Fifty-eight experts in the field of hamstring 
injury management selected by 28 FIFA Medical 
Centres of Excellence worldwide participated. Each 
Delphi round consisted of a questionnaire, an analysis 
and an anonymised feedback report. After four Delphi 
rounds, with more than 83% response for each round, 
consensus was achieved that RTP should be defined as 
’the moment a player has received criteria-based medical 
clearance and is mentally ready for full availability 
for match selection and/or full training’. The experts 
reached consensus on the following criteria to support 
the RTP decision: medical staff clearance, absence of 
pain on palpation, absence of pain during strength and 
flexibility testing, absence of pain during/after functional 
testing, similar hamstring flexibility, performance on 
field testing, and psychological readiness. It was also 
agreed that RTP decisions should be based on shared 
decision-making, primarily via consultation with the 
athlete, sports physician, physiotherapist, fitness trainer 
and team coach. The consensus regarding aspects of RTP 
should provide clarity and facilitate the assessment of 
when RTP is appropriate after hamstring injury, so as to 
avoid or reduce the risk of injury recurrence because of a 
premature RTP.
IntroductIon
Hamstring injuries are the most prevalent muscle 
injury in football, and 12%–33% of athletes with 
a hamstring injury experience a recurrence within 
a year after the initial injury.1–5 The burden of 
hamstring injury is high: for the professional player 
an average of 18 days and 3 matches missed per 
season,5 and for the professional football club an 
average of 15 matches and 90 days missed per 
season.5 The inability to play because of injury, 
but also because of unnecessary prolonged absence 
from play during rehabilitation, affects the indi-
vidual player and team performance. Lower injury 
burden and higher match availability are signifi-
cantly associated with a higher final league ranking, 
points per league match and success in the Union of 
European Football Association Champions league 
or Europa League.6 
Reducing the risk of injury recurrence is a key 
priority after the initial hamstring injury. Recurrent 
injuries require more extensive rehabilitation than 
the primary injury, and previous injury is an undis-
puted risk factor for future injury.3 7–10 Particularly 
alarming is the observation that recurrence rates 
have not improved over the last 30 years.11–13 High 
recurrence rates might be due to inadequate rehabil-
itation and/or premature return to play (RTP).14 15 
Of all recurrences, more than half occur within 
the first month after RTP
.10 16 This has prompted 
interest in RTP after hamstring injury.17–21
Unfortunately, different concepts of RTP make 
it difficult to analyse and compare various studies 
of RTP after hamstring injury.22 23 It is recognised 
that diversity in definitions and methodologies 
contributes to significant differences in the results 
and conclusions obtained from sports injury 
research.24–27 Furthermore, in accordance with the 
Strategic Assessment of Risk and Risk Tolerance 
framework (figure 1), it is commonly agreed that 
any RTP decision should be based on an assess-
ment of the risk and the acceptable risk tolerance 
threshold.28 29 So far, no studies have specified 
how risk should be assessed when clinicians are 
faced with the RTP decision after hamstring injury, 
although this moment is vital if injury recurrence 
is to be prevented. A recent systematic review of 
the literature showed that there is great diversity 
in how RTP after hamstring injury is defined and 
which criteria are used to assess RTP readiness.22 
Also, because multiple stakeholders have their own 
reasons why RTP should be accelerated or delayed, 
it is imperative to provide clarity on who is to 
be consulted and who is responsible for the RTP 
decision.
The aim of this Delphi procedure was to deter-
mine, based on expert consensus, a clear defini-
tion of and medical criteria for RTP and to clarify 
responsibilities for RTP after hamstring injury.

study design and setting
This Delphi study was part of the Hamstring Injury 
Prevention Strategies project, which includes several 
studies focusing on the prevention of hamstring 
(re-)injuries. The present Delphi procedure is one of 
these studies and aimed to achieve consensus on the 
terminology, definition and medical criteria for RTP

consensus statement
RTP decision after hamstring injury. The study was carried out 
by the Department of Rehabilitation, Physical Therapy Science, 
and Sport at the University Medical Centre of Utrecht, the Neth-
erlands. Before the start of this project, a systematic review of 
the definition of, and criteria for, RTP after hamstring injury was 
performed.22 The results of the systematic review were used as a 
starting point for the Delphi procedure.
delphi procedure
We used a series of sequential questionnaires or ‘rounds’, inter-
spersed by feedback, to achieve consensus of opinion among 
a panel of experts.30 31 This scientific method was originally 
developed in the 1950s and has been effectively used in sports 
medicine research.32–35 Each Delphi round comprised a ques-
tionnaire, an analysis and a feedback report.
steering committee
The steering committee that facilitated and guided this 
Delphi study consisted of a full professor in sports medicine, 
a senior researcher with experience in Delphi procedures, a 
team doctor of a national football team and a PhD student. 
All members have a clinical (sports medicine, (sports) physical 
therapy) and scientific background. The steering committee 
was responsible for preparing and analysing the questionnaires 
and for reporting the results in anonymised feedback reports.
expert panel
The FIFA Medical Centres of Excellence (FMCoEs) have a 
demonstrable record of leadership in football medicine and 
have been accredited through a strict selection process by 
FIFA. These centres provide a network of knowledge and 
experience in research and clinical management of hamstring 
injuries. All FMCoEs (n=40) were invited to select up to 
three experts in hamstring injury management to participate 
in our Delphi study, adhering to the inclusion criteria as listed 
in Box 1. These criteria are commonly used when selecting 
experts who participate in a Delphi study.33 36–38 After selec-
tion, the steering committee contacted all experts via email 
to provide information about the aim, methods and privacy 
statements for the Delphi study.
Procedure
Online surveys were used and adhered to principles of respon-
dent anonymity and feedback between rounds.30 For all Delphi

consensus statement
rounds, experts received an invitation via email with a link 
to an online questionnaire. Experts were given 6 weeks to 
complete the questionnaire, with reminders emailed at 3 and 
5 weeks. A structured web-based questionnaire was developed 
consisting of three parts: part I for general questions about 
RTP consultation and responsibilities, part II for the definition 
of RTP and part III for criteria to support the RTP decision 
after hamstring injury. During the whole procedure, we used 
structured questions, such as ‘Do you feel this item should be a 
part of the RTP definition?’ or ‘Do you feel this item should be 
a criterion to support the RTP decision after hamstring injury?’ 
Answer options were ‘yes’, ‘no’ or ‘no opinion’. Experts were 
encouraged to provide justification for their answers. Topics 
that did not reach consensus were included in the next Delphi 
round. For some questions, the steering committee added a 
‘note from the steering committee’, based on expert opinion 
or the literature.
cut-off point for consensus
A cut-off score of ≥70% agreement was proposed for consensus 
because this cut-off is often used in Delphi procedures.36 37 39
rtP terminology
The expert panel was asked to reach consensus regarding which 
term for RTP in sports should be adopted (eg, return to sport, 
RTP
, return to competition, etc).
definition of rtP after a hamstring injury
Results from the systematic review22 that we conducted to 
inform the Delphi process (Box 2) were used as the starting 
point for the Delphi process for the definition of RTP
. Experts 
were asked which terms should or should not be included in 
the RTP definition. Experts were also invited to open-ended 
question regarding the definition of RTP after hamstring 
injury.
Medical criteria to support the rtP decision after a hamstring 
injury
Similar to the definition of RTP
, a systematic review of the medical 
criteria used to support the RTP decision after hamstring injury 
was used as a starting point for this part of the Delphi process.22 
Experts were asked which criteria should or should not be used 
to support the final RTP decision and to provide any additional 
criteria they thought relevant.
rtP responsibilities
The relevant stakeholders in RTP decision-making were initially 
identified from the published literature.40 41 Experts were addi-
tionally asked to name other stakeholders involved in RTP 
consultation and decision-making.
data analysis
Data from all Delphi rounds were extracted from the online 
survey database to SPSS V
.22.0, and anonymously reported 
in feedback reports. For questions with a ‘yes/no/no opinion’ 
answer format, the percentage of answers in each category was 
calculated. Qualitative data (ie, expert answers and justifica-
tions) were analysed by content analysis and discussed by the 
steering committee. This information and the main arguments 
of the experts were summarised and included in a ‘note from the 
steering committee’ and added to each question. If consensus was 
not reached on a topic, these notes were included in a follow-up 
question on a related subject, used to rephrase the original ques-
tion or to compose new questions on this topic.
results
After four consecutive Delphi rounds, performed between July 
2015 and July 2016, full consensus was achieved on three main 
content areas. The final consensus is presented in the RTP model 
for hamstring injuries in football (figure 2).
expert panel
Fifty-eight experts were recruited from 28 FMCoEs worldwide 
(participating experts are included in the acknowledgements 
section). Eleven FMCoEs did not respond to the invitation and 
one FMCoE could not participate due to migration. The partici-
pating experts had a range of experiences in clinical practice and 
research, including full professor, medical director, lecturer, sports 
physician, orthopaedic surgeon, physical therapist, performance 
coach, athletic trainer and/or clinical researcher. Most members 
had written multiple high-quality international publications, and 
had an average of 15.8 (SD ±8.2; range: 3–35) years of practical 
experience in the field of hamstring injury management in football. 
The response rates in this Delphi procedure were 93% (round 1), 
90% (rounds 2 and 3) and 84% (round 4).
cut-off point for consensus
In Delphi round 1, the expert panel agreed that a cut-off score of 
≥70% 
would be used to define consensus.
rtP terminology
In Delphi round 1, most experts chose either ‘return to play’ 
or ‘return to competition’ as the term to define RTP
. In Delphi 
round 2, consensus was reached to adopt return to play—
including its acronym RTP—as the term for return to play in 
sports, with the justification being that it is simple, well-known 
and adopted worldwide at many levels, including conferences 
and publications. It was agreed that ‘return to competition’

definition of rtP after a hamstring injury
In the first Delphi round, consensus was reached to include ‘avail-
ability for match selection and/or full training’ and ‘clearance by 
medical staff’ as part of the RTP definition after a hamstring 
injury. There was also consensus that ‘a completed game’ should 
not be included in the RTP definition because RTP clearance 
should be given before a player resumes play and availability to 
play a match might be based on non-medical (eg, tactical, team-
based) factors or decisions. The expert panel suggested consid-
ering inclusion of ‘a player’s positive mental attitude (athlete’s 
readiness)’ in the definition of RTP after hamstring injury.
In Delphi rounds 2 and 3, there was consensus that ‘full 
activity’, ‘a 100% recovery score on fitness and skill testing’, 
‘absence of symptoms on injured leg’, ‘completion of a reha-
bilitation programme’ and ‘reaching preinjury level’ should not 
be included in the definition of RTP after hamstring injury. The 
rationale was that these items are not specific enough and/or 
should be considered as criteria for RTP
, but not for RTP defini-
tion. In Delphi round 3, consensus was achieved on including ‘a 
player’s positive mental attitude (athlete readiness)’ in the defini-
tion of RTP
, because mental readiness was considered important 
to eliminate anxiety and because a positive mental attitude is 
perceived to diminish the risk of reinjury and to improve 
performance.
The expert panel reached consensus that RTP should be 
defined as ‘the moment a player has received criteria-based 
medical clearance and is mentally ready for full availability for 
match selection and/or full training’.
Medical criteria to support the rtP decision after a hamstring 
injury
After discussion and specification of criteria through all rounds 
of this Delphi consensus procedure, the following criteria were 
included: medical staff clearance, similar hamstring flexibility 
(compared with preinjury data and/or uninjured side, depending 
on which data are available or are most reliable for the indi-
vidual player according to the medical staff), performance on 
field testing, psychological readiness, and absence of pain on 
palpation, strength testing, flexibility testing and/or functional 
testing. Additionally, the expert panel stated that specification of 
criteria was required. The experts agreed that ‘similar hamstring 
flexibility’ could involve a 0%–10% 
difference between injured 
and uninjured leg or compared with preinjury data. The expert 
panel reached consensus that hamstring flexibility should be 
assessed by means of both the active and the passive straight leg 
raise test. The rationale was that the passive straight leg raise 
test is considered as the gold standard for hamstring flexibility 
measurements in daily practice, and it is important to measure 
both the active and passive components.42
With regard to ‘performance on field testing’, the expert panel 
mentioned a number of field tests used in clinical practice to 
support the RTP decision after hamstring injury (see table 1). In 
Delphi round 3, the experts were asked whether they had prac-
tical experience with other field tests of functional performance 
and whether they would recommend using these tests to support 
the RTP decision after hamstring injury (see table 1). Consensus 
was reached that the repeated sprint ability test,43 deceleration 
drills, single leg bridge and position-specific global positioning 
system (GPS)-targeted match-specific rehabilitation were rele-
vant functional performance tests to support the RTP decision 
after hamstring injury. In addition to the consensus achieved on 
the inclusion of these tests, the experts frequently commented 
that performance on field-testing should involve explosive 
movements to mimic football performance.
No consensus was reached for the inclusion or exclusion of 
‘similar eccentric hamstring strength’ as a criterion to support the 
RTP decision after hamstring injury. The expert panel remained 
divided, with two irreconcilable opinions: one group of experts 
stated that similar eccentric strength assessment is important as 
a criterion for RTP as the eccentric phase is also the contraction 
mode in which injury occurs, and strength asymmetries should 
be eliminated because they can increase the risk of injury. The 
other group of experts stated that strength measurements are not 
functional, asymmetries are normal, and that too many factors 
influence the measurement of strength, so that reliable measure-
ments are not possible. In Delphi round 4, consensus was 
reached to add ‘similar eccentric hamstring strength’ (compared 
with preinjury data and/or uninjured side, depending on which 
data are available or are most reliable for the individual player 
according to the medical staff) as a potential criterion to support 
the RTP decision provided that both sides of the argument would 
be described in the consensus.
The experts agreed that ‘neuromuscular function’ should 
not be included as a criterion for RTP after hamstring injury. 
Although the experts stated that neuromuscular function is 
always important, specifying the concept and assessment of 
neuromuscular function would go beyond the scope of this 
Delphi procedure and was therefore not indicated as a criterion. 
The exclusion of MRI assessment as a potential criterion for 
RTP decision-making after hamstring injury was supported by 
recent studies.20 44 Baseline MRI parameters are not predictive of 
hamstring reinjury, and MRI is not of additional predictive value 
compared with baseline patient history and clinical examination 
alone.20 45 Completion of a number of full training sessions was 
also excluded as a criterion as ‘availability for full training and 
match selection’ was already included in the definition of RTP 
after hamstring injury.
rtP responsibilities
In Delphi round 2, consensus was reached that the sports physi-
cian, physiotherapist, fitness trainer and athlete are the primary 
stakeholders to be involved in RTP decision-making. There was 
discussion about the role of the team coach, who not being medi-
cally qualified might allow an early RTP to improve team perfor-
mance, despite potential medical risks. However, in Delphi

consensus statement
round 3, the expert panel reached consensus on the inclusion of 
the team coach for RTP consultation because of his/her ability to 
assess the sport-specific performance level, his/her role in team 
selection and his/her function in the multidisciplinary team staff. 
The sports physician (who often acts as the head of the medical 
staff) was chosen to be ultimately responsible for the RTP deci-
sion, based on the input provided by the multidisciplinary team 
and the athlete.
dIscussIon
This Delphi study involving 58 experts from 28 FIFA Medical 
Centres of Excellence worldwide reached consensus on a clear 
definition and medical criteria for RTP after hamstring injury 
and who should be consulted about RTP and take ultimate 
responsibility for the RTP decision (see figure 2).
definition and medical criteria for rtP
The absence of clear and uniform definitions and medical criteria 
for RTP has been a methodological issue in studies of different 
musculoskeletal domains, such as RTP after anterior cruciate 
ligament injury, ankle injury and concussion.46–49 A clear defini-
tion of RTP is needed for consistency when investigating issues 
related to RTP
, including reinjury risk factors, RTP prognostic 
factors and intervention programmes.22 24–27 Differences in the 
definition and criteria for RTP after hamstring injury make it 
difficult to compare study results and lead to uncertainty about 
which findings should be implemented in clinical practice.22 The 
2016 consensus statement on return to sport defined RTP as a 
continuum comprising three key elements—return to partici-
pation, return to preinjury sport and return to performance.50 
This approach complements criteria-based rehabilitation, 
and considers the entire rehabilitation and recovery process, 
including the phase beyond return to sport where the athlete 
returns to his/her desired performance level.50 However, it is 
important to differentiate between the return to sport process 
and the final RTP decision, where RTP is viewed as an endpoint 
(or primary outcome). This Delphi study explicitly focused on 
the final RTP decision (when is the player fully available for 
match selection and full training) and involved consensus among 
experts in the field of prevention and treatment of hamstring 
injuries in football. Although not yet studied and validated in 
clinical practice, this Delphi study may help clinicians faced with 
the problem of when an athlete should RTP after a hamstring 
injury. Furthermore, both the definition and criteria can be 
used in research, potentially leading to greater uniformity and 
promoting comparability of research.
Medical criteria for rtP after hamstring injury
Absence of pain and psychological readiness
Absence of pain on palpation of the hamstrings, during strength 
and flexibility testing, and during or after functional perfor-
mance was considered important as pain may indicate incom-
plete tissue healing. Athletes with localised discomfort on 
palpation just after RTP following hamstring injury were four 
times (AOR: 3.95; 95% 
CI: 1.38 to 11.37) more likely to sustain 
a reinjury than athletes without discomfort on palpation.20 
However, pain perception is influenced by tissue damage and 
by cognitive factors such as fear of reinjury or fear of pain.51 52 
The fear of pain or reinjury generates avoidance behaviour.52 53 
In addition, athletes mention fear of reinjury as the main reason 
for not returning to sport.54
The relationship between fear of reinjury and unsuccessful 
RTP led to the suggestion that psychological readiness be 
included in RTP guidelines.55–57 We included psychological 
readiness in both the definition and criteria for RTP after 
hamstring injury. The expert panel agreed that the psycho-
logical readiness of the player should be considered before 
RTP clearance. Studies focusing on other musculoskeletal 
injuries previously emphasised the importance of psycholog-
ical readiness assessment as a part of the RTP decision.55–57 
For example, the Knee Self-Efficacy Scale is recommended for 
the RTP evaluation of patients rehabilitating from an anterior 
cruciate ligament injury.58 However, there are no valid tools to 
quantify psychological readiness after hamstring injury reha-
bilitation. The potential relationship between psychological 
factors and RTP after hamstring injuries remains an important 
topic for future research.
Similar hamstring strength and hamstring flexibility
An isometric knee flexion force deficit just after RTP is asso-
ciated with an increased risk of hamstring injury.20 Our expert 
panel did not reach consensus regarding whether ‘similar eccen-
tric hamstring strength’ should be a criterion to support the 
RTP decision. Although there was consenus that other contrac-
tion modes should not be included as a criterion to support the 
RTP decision. Hamstring peak torque, quadriceps peak torque 
and conventional concentric hamstring:quadriceps ratios (as 
measured with different test speeds and muscle contractions) 
are not associated with an increased risk of hamstring reinjury.8 
There is also no relationship between concentric hamstring 
to opposite hamstring (H:Hopp) ratio and hamstring reinjury. 
However, eccentric strength asymmetries are predictive of 
hamstring muscle injuries in football players.59 Furthermore, 
67% of all football players clinically recovered from hamstring 
injuries had at least one hamstring isokinetic testing deficit of 
more than 10%.21 Thus elimination of isokinetic strength asym-
metries is not a requirement for RTP
, although it is not known 
whether isokinetic strength deficits are associated with the risk 
of hamstring reinjury.21
From a biomechanical perspective, strength is preferably 
measured in a (sub)maximally stretched position, for which a 
fair amount of hamstring extensibility is required.60–63 There is 
ongoing debate regarding the relationship between hamstring 
flexibility and risk of hamstring injury.7 8 Many studies have 
not found hamstring flexibility to be a risk factor for hamstring 
injury.8 64 However, the H-test (an active hamstring flexibility 
test) showed promising results as a complement to clinical exam-
ination.65 Experts in our Delphi study stated that this test seems 
promising as it involves an active flexibility component as well 
as assessment of insecurity in the athlete. However, there was 
no consensus on the inclusion of this test to support the RTP 
decision because experts stated there was insufficient evidence to 
support the use of the test and because the test lacks functionality.
Performance on field testing
Performance on field testing was considered vital by the 
expert panel when assessing RTP readiness, as it mimics the 
actual sports requirements. Furthermore, many criteria-based 
hamstring injury rehabilitation protocols have suggested 
including performance-based criteria, such as a normal week 
of training sessions,66 sport-specific scenarios21 and functional 
phase training.17 As most hamstring injuries occur in the 
latter stages of a match or training, fatigue and its associated 
decline in functional performance need to be considered in 
addition to field testing.5 67 68 Therefore, one could argue that 
both qualitative and quantitative assessments of functional

potentially hamstring strength are assessed in the light of the 
RTP decision.
hamstring rtP decision-making
Owing to the complexity of RTP decision-making, as well as 
potential competing interests and different views of various 
stakeholders, it is commonly agreed that RTP decisions should 
be based on multidisciplinary consultation.23 41 69 Although the 
sports physician may be best qualified to synthesise medical 
information, step 3 of the Creighton model29 describes some 
important RTP decision modifiers (eg, financial interests, 
timing in season, internal pressure, etc). Generally, the sports 
physician is only responsible for the medical part of the RTP 
decision and does not have the final say over these decision 
modifiers (such as financial, legal or team-tactical issues). 
Hence, the sports physician may have responsibility for the 
decision without authority to make it.69 Ultimately, the best 
interests of the athlete are decisive, and this covers more 
than just the medical risk assessment.28 29 41 Therefore, in our 
opinion, different stakeholders with different views should be 
involved in the final RTP decision, bearing in mind the best 
interests of the athlete.
strengths and weaknesses of this study
Delphi studies have the advantage of using the knowledge and 
expertise of participating experts to reach consensus.30 70 71 This 
Delphi study involved a multidisciplinary sample of clinical and 
academic experts with extensive experience in hamstring injury 
research and rehabilitation. Although there is no scientifically 
proven minimally acceptable response rate, a response rate 
of 60% has been used as the threshold of acceptability.72 This 
Delphi consensus study had an excellent response rate of >83% 
for each Delphi round.
The results of Delphi studies should be viewed in the light of 
the expert panel’s opinion at any given point in time,70 because 
opinions may change in the light of new evidence and paradigm 
shifts.73 Therefore, both the definition and criteria for RTP after 
hamstring injury should be re-evaluated in the future, based on 
new research findings.
When drafting this consensus, no limitations regarding 
(medical) staff and tools were considered. This makes the 
consensus more suitable for a professional setting compared 
with an amateur setting due to differences regarding team 
staff and (access to) tools such as GPS tracking systems. Teams 
with limited access to a comprehensive team staff are advised 
to still consider and acknowledge the multifaceted nature of 
the RTP decision, as discussed in this manuscript. This Delphi 
consensus procedure additionally advised simpler functional 
tests if GPS tracking systems and/or speed measurement equip-
ment is unavailable (eg, repeated sprint ability test, decelera-
tion drills, etc), although GPS tracking systems are considered 
an important tool for functional assessment by the majority of 
our expert panel due to their ability to mimic sport-specific 
function.
This study provided medical criteria to assess the health status 
of the athlete. This is only the first step in the three-step RTP 
assessment after hamstring injury (see figure 1).28 29 In addi-
tion to the health status evaluation, the assessment of tissue 
stresses (from type of sport, level of play, etc) and RTP decision 
modifiers (timing and season, pressure from the athlete or 
external, financial issues, etc) should form a solid basis for RTP 
decision-making.28 29
clinical relevance
Although experts’ opinions are considered a low level of 
evidence, we consider this study to be an important first step 
in standardising and improving the final RTP decision after 
hamstring injury. In addition, the criteria to support the RTP 
decision were generated by clinical and academic authorities in 
the field of hamstring injury management. These criteria will 
help both clinicians and (clinical) researchers to assess the risk of 
RTP after hamstring injury.
Future research
There is a need for high-quality prospective research to vali-
date RTP criteria. Considering the multidimensional nature 
of hamstring injuries, RTP criteria should not be validated as 
univariate factors, but interaction between criteria as well as 
the varying weighting of criteria due to time and circumstances 
needs to be considered.74 75
conclusIon
A panel of 58 international experts reached consensus 
regarding RTP terminology, definition, medical criteria, 
responsibilities and consultation for RTP after hamstring inju-
ries in football. The results are reported in the RTP model for 
hamstring injuries in football. The RTP decision should always 
be a multidisciplinary decision. For RTP readiness assessment 
of the player after a hamstring injury, emphasis is placed on 
pain relief, flexibility assessment, psychological readiness and 
functional performance. MRI findings should not be used for 
RTP readiness assessment.
