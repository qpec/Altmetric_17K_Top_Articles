In extensive studies with two split-brain patients we replicate the standard finding that stimuli cannot be compared across visual
half-fields, indicating that each hemisphere processes information independently of the other. Yet, crucially, we show that the
canonical textbook findings that a split-brain patient can only respond to stimuli in the left visual half-field with the left hand, and
to stimuli in the right visual half-field with the right hand and verbally, are not universally true. Across a wide variety of tasks,
split-brain patients with a complete and radiologically confirmed transection of the corpus callosum showed full awareness of
presence, and well above chance-level recognition of location, orientation and identity of stimuli throughout the entire visual field,
irrespective of response type (left hand, right hand, or verbally). Crucially, we used confidence ratings to assess conscious aware-
ness. This revealed that also on high confidence trials, indicative of conscious perception, response type did not affect performance.
These findings suggest that severing the cortical connections between hemispheres splits visual perception, but does not create two
independent conscious perceivers within one brain.

Introduction
The corpus callosum is the main route for communication
between
both
cerebral
hemispheres
(Innocenti,
1986;
Gazzaniga, 2000; Wahl et al., 2007). In ‘split-brain’
patients, the corpus callosum has been surgically cut to
alleviate intractable, severe epilepsy. One of the Nobel
Prize-winning discoveries in neuroscience is that severing
the
corpus callosum
leads
to a curious phenomenon
(Fig. 1): when an object is presented in the right visual
field, the patient responds correctly verbally and with his/
her right hand. However, when an object is presented in
the left visual field the patient verbally states that he/she
saw nothing, and identifies the object accurately with the

 left hand only (Gazzaniga et al., 1962; Gazzaniga, 1967;
Sperry, 1968, 1984; Wolman, 2012). This is concordant
with the human anatomy; the right hemisphere receives
visual input from the left visual field and controls the left
hand, and vice versa (Penfield and Boldrey, 1937; Cowey,
1979; Sakata and Taira, 1994). Moreover, the left hemi-
sphere
is
generally
the
site
of
language
processing
(Ojemann et al., 1989; Cantalupo and Hopkins, 2001;
Vigneau et al., 2006). Thus, severing the corpus callosum
seems to cause each hemisphere to gain its own conscious-
ness (Sperry, 1984). The left hemisphere is only aware of
the right visual half-field and expresses this through its
control of the right hand and verbal capacities, while the
right hemisphere is only aware of the left visual field, which
it expresses through its control of the left hand.
Strikingly, although this clinical observation features in
many textbooks (Gazzaniga et al., 1998; Gray, 2002) the
reported data are never quantitative. For three reasons it is
important to explicitly map out how often ‘blindness’ to
the left visual field is indicated by verbal/right hand
responses and unawareness to the right visual field is indi-
cated by left hand responses. First, the number of split-
brain patients is now rapidly decreasing, and it will soon
be impossible to study this phenomenon. Second, there is
some doubt about how clear-cut the textbook findings are.
In one of the seminal publications on this topic, Sperry
(1968) reports that split-brain patients seem blind to the
left visual field when responding with the right hand and
vice versa. However, in the last paragraph (p. 733), Sperry
notes: ‘Although the general picture has continued to hold
up in the main as described [. . . .] striking modifications
and even outright exceptions can be found among the
small group of patients examined to date’. Moreover,
Levy et al. (1972) investigated perception of chimeric
faces in five split-brain patients. Although not the focus
of their research, they observed that all patients were
better at matching a face to a sample when the face was
presented in the left visual field, regardless of whether they
responded with the left or the right hand (p. 65). Finally,
note that there are multiple examples in the literature sug-
gesting some kind of interhemispheric integration of infor-
mation (Corballis and Trudel, 1993; Corballis, 1995;
Corballis and Corballis, 2001; Savazzi and Marzi, 2004;
Savazzi et al., 2007). This, like Sperry’s (1968) closing
remark, casts doubt on the precise nature of the split-
brain phenomenon.
Third, the status of split-brain patients may have import-
ant consequences for current dominant theories of con-
sciousness. Congruent with the canonical view of split-
brain patients, both the Global Workspace theory (Baars,
1988,
2005;
Dehaene
and
Naccache,
2001)
and
the
Information
Integration
theory
(Tononi,
2004,
2005;
Tononi and Koch, 2015) imply that without massive inter-
hemispheric communication two independent conscious
systems appear. If the canonical view cannot be quantita-
tively replicated, and evidence for conscious unity in the
split-brain syndrome is found, both theories may require
substantial modifications.
In our current studies we reproduced the classic finding
that split-brain patients are unable to integrate visual infor-
mation across the two visual half-fields. However, we also
investigated systematically to what extent performance de-
pends on where a stimulus appears. For various tasks and
stimuli we studied whether there is a response type � visual

Figure 1 A depiction of the traditional view of the split brain syndrome (top) versus what we actually found in two split-brain
patients across a wide variety of tasks (bottom). The canonical idea of split-brain patients is that they cannot compare stimuli across visual
half-fields (left), because visual processing is not integrated across hemispheres. This is what we found as well. However, another key element of
the traditional view is that split-brain patients can only respond accurately to stimuli in the left visual field with their left hand and to stimuli in the
right visual field with their right hand and verbally. This is not what we found. Across a wide variety of tasks, we observed that split-brain patients
could reliably indicate presence, location, orientation and identity of stimuli throughout the entire visual field regardless of how they responded.

 field interaction: can split-brain patients only respond to
stimuli in the left visual field with the left hand, and to
stimuli in the right visual field with the right hand or
verbally?
Patients and methods
Subjects
Patients were tested across several years, during their routine
neurological control visits. For Experiment 1 we tested Patients
DDC and DDV, for Experiments 2–5 we tested Patient DDC.
Both patients underwent a full callosotomy to relieve epileptic
seizures. Crucially, for current purposes, in Patient DDC the
complete corpus callosum and most of the anterior commis-
sure was cut, and in Patient DDV the complete corpus callo-
sum was removed. We selected Patient DDC for the extensive
follow-up testing since his ‘split’ is the most severe. Note that
other than the removal of the corpus callosum, both patients
had no brain damage, and fell within the normal IQ range. See
Supplementary material and Pizzini et al. (2010) and Corballis
et al. (2010) for detailed descriptions of these patients. In all
experiments the patient(s) responded with three response types
(response conditions were blocked), verbal, right hand or left
hand, except for Experiment 2A, where the patient only re-
sponded verbally; and Experiments 2C and 4A where only left
and right hand responses and no verbal responses were given.
The experimenter (who could not see the test stimuli) mouse-
clicked on the response box or location indicated by the pa-
tient. In the case of verbal position indication, the mouse was
moved by the experimenter (not having seen the stimulus) on
the instructions of the patient until the desired position was
obtained.
Procedure
In Experiment 1 both patients performed a combined detec-
tion/localization task. Either nothing appeared (50% of trials)
or a red solid circle, on a grey background (see Supplementary
material for all stimulus details), appeared for 120 ms any-
where in the visual field. Each trial the patient indicated
whether a stimulus had appeared, and if so where.
In Experiment 2A, Patient DDC indicated whether two rect-
angles had the same orientation. In Experiment 2B he reported
if two simple shapes were the same, and in Experiment 2C he
indicated if two pictures were equal. In all experiments the test
stimuli appeared for 120 ms. The stimuli appeared (i) both in
left visual field; (ii) both in right visual field; or (iii) they ap-
peared around fixation with one stimulus in left visual field
and on in right visual field. In Experiment 3A a picture was
presented for 120 ms in the left or right visual field, after
which Patient DDC selected the correct verbal label matching
the picture. Experiment 3B was identical to 3A, but instead of
selecting a verbal label, Patient DDC selected from two pic-
tures which image he had just seen.
In Experiment 4A either nothing appeared, or a simple shape
(square, circle or triangle) appeared for 100 ms in the left or
right visual field. Patient DDC indicated if something had ap-
peared, and if so what. In Experiment 4B two rectangles were
successively presented, the first of which appeared for 120 ms,
in the left or right visual field. Patient DDC indicated whether
both rectangles had the same orientation, and if not, how large
the orientation difference was. In both experiments, after each
trial, Patient DDC indicated confidence in his judgement
(Experiment 4A on a scale from 1 to 4, Experiment 4B on a
scale from 1 to 4). Experiment 5 was similar to Experiment 1,
except after each trial Patient DDC indicated confidence in his
presence and location judgement (on a scale from 1 to 5).
Moreover, stimuli were bright green on a red background,
or dim green on a red background. In the latter case stimuli
and background were equiluminant (as determined by an ob-
jective measurement).
Results
Figures 2 to 4 provide an overview of the experiments and
results (for a detailed description of the methods and results
see the Supplementary material). In all experiments, we
measured eye movements and excluded trials where the
patient did not appropriately fixate the centre of the
screen during stimulus presentation. We used permutation
testing to compare observed to chance performance.
In Experiment 1 (Fig. 2), we explored to what extent
Patients DDV and DDC can detect stimuli across the
entire visual field using three response conditions: left
hand, right hand, and verbally. Subjects were shown red
circles in various locations of the visual field (50% of trials
no stimulus was presented), and had to detect presence or
absence either verbally or by indicating yes/no with either
hand. Subsequently, for seen stimuli, they had to indicate
the location of the stimulus. Both patients responded
(nearly) perfectly in indicating presence of the stimulus
(Patient DDV, hits: 100%, false alarms: 0%; Patient
DDC, hits: 97.5%, false alarms: 7.7%), and were highly
accurate in indicating location of the stimulus (average dis-
tance between pointed location and actual location: Patient
DDV: 2.8�, Patient DDC: 4.5�). While presence and loca-
tion performance was highly significantly above chance
(all P 5 0.001), the response type � visual half-field inter-
action did not approach significance in either patient or
task (all P 4 0.5).
This surprising finding of full detection awareness and
above chance localization regardless of visual field of stimu-
lation and response mode, led us to the question whether,
in these patients, visual information is transferred (to a
degree) across hemispheres. We tested this on Patient
DDC by asking him to compare stimuli across hemispheres.
In Experiment 2 (Fig. 3), Patient DDC indicated whether
two stimuli (situated either within or between visual half-
fields), had the same orientation, shape or identity. In keep-
ing with earlier research (Corballis and Corballis, 2001),
we found that he cannot compare stimuli across both
visual
half-fields
(average
performance
55.4% correct,
which is not statistically better than chance performance,
all stimulus categories P 4 0.25), although he can make the
same comparison within one visual half-field (average per-
formance 90.4% correct, all P 5 0.001). This suggests that

 the areas involved in processing visual information do not
have access to the information that is being processed in
the other hemisphere.
We found further evidence that visual information is not
shared between hemispheres in Experiment 3 (Fig. 3). Here
we observed that Patient DDC was better at selecting the
correct verbal label for an image when it had appeared in
the right visual field than when it had appeared in the left
visual field (Experiment 3A, left visual field: 73.4%, right
visual field: 92.1%, left visual field versus right visual field:
P 5 0.001). Yet, he was better at matching a stimulus to
sample for items in left visual field, replicating earlier split-
brain findings (Funnell et al., 1999) (Experiment 3B, left
visual field: 95.5%, right visual field: 73%, left visual field
versus right visual field: P 5 0.001). Note that, despite the
seeming lack of transfer of visual information, we still
observed no response type � visual field interaction in
Experiments 2 and 3 (all P 4 0.12). Thus, for instance,
Patient DDC was better at matching to sample of stimuli
in the left visual field even when he responded with the
right hand. This suggests that processing of visual stimuli
remains within each individual hemisphere, each with its
own relative performances in various tasks, yet control
over the report of the outcomes of this processing is
undivided.
Finally, to assess whether the seeming unity in respond-
ing could be driven by unconscious processes, in the fol-
lowing
three
experiments,
Patient
DDC
indicated
confidence in his performance after each trial (Fig. 4).
The idea behind obtaining confidence ratings is that these
may reveal whether information is processed consciously or
unconsciously.
When
information
is
processed
uncon-
sciously, the observer does not know when he gives correct
or
incorrect
responses,
and
gives
a
uniformly
low
confidence (he always feels that he is guessing). However,
when information is processed consciously, the observer
knows quite accurately when he perceived an event and
when he did not, leading to high confidence on correct,
and low confidence on incorrect trials (Rosenthal, 2000;
Lau and Rosenthal, 2011).
First, Patient DDC was tested on two visual matching
experiments (shape and orientation). Second, he performed
a detection and localization task of simple stimuli as in the
first experiment (with the addition that the stimuli were
presented equiluminantly with the background or with a
large
luminance
difference).
Patient
DDC
performed
nearly flawlessly in detecting objects in Experiment 5 (no
false alarms and two misses in 167 trials). This ceiling
effect precluded meaningful metacognitive assessment of
this aspect of the task. However, in the other two experi-
ments and the localization of objects in Experiment 5, per-
formance did not show a ceiling or floor effect, allowing us
to investigate metacognitive abilities in these cases. This
revealed that in all three experiments Patient DDC’s per-
formance was better on high than on low confidence trials.

Patient DDC was not able to compare stimuli across visual half-

(Experiment 2A–C). Moreover, he was better at labelling stimuli in
the right visual field (Experiment 3A) and better at matching stimuli
in the left visual field (Experiment 3B). Crucially, although visual in-
formation remained unintegrated across visual half-fields, there was
still no response type � visual field interaction.

Experiment 5, � = �0.227, P = 0.02. There were no differ-
ences between � correlations in left visual field and right
visual field, all P 4 0.09). Both analyses indicate that
Patient DDC possessed accurate metacognition. Crucially,
on high confidence trials we still found no response
type � visual field interaction (all P 4 0.63). This indicates
that Patient DDC’s performance is not rooted in uncon-
scious processes: his correct answers are based on con-
scious awareness and decisions. Note further that in the
detection and localization task, luminance difference did
not affect results (all P 4 0.8), indicating that our findings
are not due to overly strong stimulation, or stray-light leak-
ing over to the other visual half-field.
In addition to these five experiments we obtained phe-
nomenal
reports
from
both
split-brain
patients
(see
Supplementary
material
for
an
extensive
description).
Both patients indicated that they saw their entire visual
field (so not just the visual field to the left or right of fix-
ation). Further, they indicated that they felt, and were in
control of their entire body. Finally, they reported that their
conscious unity was unchanged since the operation (i.e. no
other conscious agent seemed to be present in their brain/
body). These phenomenal reports are congruent with ear-
lier reports of split-brain patients, which documented that
split-brain patients feel normal and behave normally in
social situations (Bogen et al., 1965; Sperry, 1968).
Discussion
In conclusion, with two patients, and across a wide variety
of tasks we have shown that severing the cortical connec-
tions between the two hemispheres does not seem to lead to
two
independent
conscious
agents
within
one
brain.
Instead, we observed that patients without a corpus callo-
sum were able to respond accurately to stimuli appearing
anywhere in the visual field, regardless of whether they
responded verbally, with the left or the right hand—despite
not being able to compare stimuli between visual half-
fields, and despite finding separate levels of performance
in each visual half-field for labelling or matching stimuli.
This raises the intriguing possibility that even without mas-
sive communication between the cerebral hemispheres, and
thus increased modularity, unity in consciousness and re-
sponding is largely preserved.
This preserved unity of consciousness may be especially
challenging for the two currently most dominant theories of
consciousness, the Global Workspace theory (Baars, 1988,
2005; Dehaene and Naccache, 2001) and the Integration
Information theory (Tononi, 2004, 2005; Tononi and
Koch,
2015).
A
core
assumption
of
the
Global
Workspace theory is that cortical broadcasting of selected
information by the ‘global workspace’ leads to conscious-
ness. Thus severing of the corpus callosum, which prevents
broadcasting of information across hemispheres, seems to
exclude the emergence of one global workspace for both
hemispheres. Rather, it seems that without a corpus callo-
sum either two independent global workspaces emerge, or
only one hemisphere will have a global workspace, while
the other does not. In either case, an integrated global
workspace, and thus preserved conscious unity, seems to
be difficult to fit into this framework.
Also for Integration Information theory, conscious unity
in
the
split-brain
syndrome
seems
to
be
challenging.
According to the Integration Information theory the rich-
ness of integration of information (called f, defined by how
much information is represented, and how integrated the

formed better on high confidence than on low confidence
trials, suggesting accurate metacognition. Moreover, also for
high confidence trials we observed no response type � visual field

scious perception, not on blindsight-like processes.

determines
the
level
of
consciousness.
Moreover, only if the combined f of two subsystems is
larger than the f per system, then the two subsystems com-
bine to form one conscious entity. After removal of the
corpus callosum, which all but eliminates communication
between the cerebral hemispheres, integration of informa-
tion is larger within each hemisphere than between hemi-
spheres. Thus, according to the Integration Information
theory, in the split-brain syndrome f per hemisphere is
larger than the combined f, thus leading to two independ-
ent conscious systems rather than one conscious agent
(Tononi, 2005).
It thus seems that the current results provide a challenge
for the Global Workspace and the Integrated Information
theory of consciousness. However, the current results may
fit well with the local recurrent processing theory of con-
sciousness (Lamme and Roelfsema, 2000; Lamme, 2006;
Block, 2007). This theory claims that local recurrent inter-
actions between neural areas (for example between V1 and
V5 in the visual system) are enough to create conscious-
ness, even if these interactions are not part of a larger
integrated network, and do not project their outcomes to
a central processing unit. Thus, according to this theory,
even in healthy subjects, relatively isolated processing in
one hemisphere can lead to normal visual experiences.
Therefore, the local recurrent processing theory suggests
that consciousness in split-brain patients may be similar
to consciousness in healthy subjects (and thus equally
unified).
How should these results be compared to our classic text-
book knowledge of the split-brain phenomenon? It is un-
likely that our results can be explained by the anterior and
posterior commissure still being (somewhat) intact, as this
was also the case for many of the previously tested patients,
and this did not seem to play an important role then
(Gazzaniga et al., 1985; Seymour et al., 1994; Gazzaniga,
2005).
Another possible explanation to consider is that the cur-
rent findings were caused by cross-cueing (one hemisphere
informing the other hemisphere with behavioural tricks,
such as touching the left hand with the right hand). We
deem this explanation implausible for four reasons. First,
cross-cueing is thought to only allow the transfer of one bit
of information (Baynes et al., 1995). Yet, both patients
could localize stimuli throughout the entire visual field ir-
respective of response mode (Experiments 1 and 5), and
localizing a stimulus requires more than one bit of infor-
mation. Second, visual capabilities differed per hemifield
(Experiment 3: better matching for stimuli in left visual
field, better labelling of stimuli in right visual field) and
comparison of stimuli over hemifields was not possible
(Experiment 2). This suggests that transfer of visual infor-
mation did not occur. Yet, in these same experiments re-
sponse type did not affect performance, suggesting that
unity in control was not driven by any form of transfer
of visual information. Third, we explicitly set up the ex-
periments to prevent cross-cueing (e.g. hands were not
allowed to touch each other, or the other half of the
body). Moreover, we did not observe any indications of
cross-cueing occurring. Fourth, as cross-cueing is a slow
process,
ipsilateral
responses
driven
by
cross-cueing
should be considerably slower than contralateral responses.
Yet, in one experiment where Patient DDC indicated, as
quickly as possible, the colour of a circle appearing shortly
to the left or the right of fixation, average ipsilateral and
contralateral
responses
were
almost
equally
fast,
and
equally accurate (ipsilateral reaction times: 1229 ms, ipsilat-
eral
accuracy:
88.4%;
contralateral
reaction
times:
1307 ms, contralateral accuracy: 97%; No significant dif-
ference between ipsilateral and contralateral reaction times:
P = 0.13; or between ipsilateral and contralateral accuracy:
P = 0.55, see Supplementary material for details).
Finally, a possibility is that we observed the current re-
sults because we tested these patients well after their surgi-
cal removal of the corpus callosum (Patient DDC and
Patient DDV were operated on at ages 19 and 22 years,
and were tested 10–16 and 17–23 years after the operation,
respectively). This would raise the interesting possibility
that the original split brain phenomenon is transient, and
that patients somehow develop mechanisms or even struc-
tural connections to re-integrate information across the
hemispheres, particularly when operated at early adult-
hood. Even then, it remains the case that these patients’
minds have a curious property: somehow, their perception
seems split, each hemisphere processing visual information
independently, and at the best of their individual—yet dif-
ferent—abilities. When it comes to reporting this informa-
tion to the outside world, however, the outcomes of the
perceptual processes are unified in consciousness, verbaliza-
tion and control of the body. This ‘split phenomenality’
combined with ‘unity of consciousness’ is difficult to
grasp introspectively, and surely warrants further study,
in a group of patients of which very few remain today.
