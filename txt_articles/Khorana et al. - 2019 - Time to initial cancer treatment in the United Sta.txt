Abstract
Background
Delays in time to treatment initiation (TTI) for new cancer diagnoses cause patient distress
and may adversely affect outcomes. We investigated trends in TTI for common solid tumors
treated with curative intent, determinants of increased TTI and association with overall
survival.
Methods and findings
We utilized prospective data from the National Cancer Database for newly diagnosed United
States patients with early-stage breast, prostate, lung, colorectal, renal and pancreas can-
cers from 2004–13. TTI was defined as days from diagnosis to first treatment (surgery, sys-
temic or radiation therapy). Negative binomial regression and Cox proportional hazard
models were used for analysis. The study population of 3,672,561 patients included breast
(N = 1,368,024), prostate (N = 944,246), colorectal (N = 662,094), non-small cell lung (N =
363,863), renal (N = 262,915) and pancreas (N = 71,419) cancers. Median TTI increased
from 21 to 29 days (P<0.001). Aside from year of diagnosis, determinants of increased TTI
included care at academic center, race, education, prior history of cancer, transfer of facility,
comorbidities and age. Increased TTI was associated with worsened survival for stages I
and II breast, lung, renal and pancreas cancers, and stage I colorectal cancers, with hazard
ratios ranging from 1.005 (95% confidence intervals [CI] 1.002–1.008) to 1.030 (95% CI
1.025–1.035) per week of increased TTI.
Conclusions
TTI has lengthened significantly and is associated with absolute increased risk of mortality
ranging from 1.2–3.2% per week in curative settings such as early-stage breast, lung, renal

Data Availability Statement: The data set utilized
to perform the analysis that follows is available
from the Commission on Cancer’s National Cancer
Database (NCDB) for researchers who meet the
criteria for access to data. The NCDB Participant
Use Data File (PUF) is a Health Insurance
Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)-
compliant data file containing cases submitted to
the Commission on Cancer’s (CoC) National
Cancer Database (NCDB). The PUF contains de-
identified patient level data that do not identify
hospitals, health care providers, or patients as
 and pancreas cancers. Studies of interventions to ease navigation and reduce barriers are
warranted to diminish potential harm to patients.
Introduction
Delays in time to treatment initiation (TTI) for new cancer diagnoses are commonly known to
cause patient anxiety and distress [1, 2, 3, 4]. Physicians often reassure patients that current
wait times to initiate therapy will not impact long-term outcomes, but the evidence is conflict-
ing. Studies in breast, head and neck, gynecologic, and lung cancer suggest that increased time
to treatment initiation (TTI) is associated with worsened survival [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]. Other stud-
ies, however, suggest no association of increased TTI on survival [10, 11, 12, 13, 14].
United States (US) health care providers perceive that TTI is worsening with increasing
complexity of health-systems and requirements for prior authorizations by insurers [15, 16,
17, 18, 19]. Median wait times for surgery increased in the decade prior to 2005 [20].
We therefore conducted a comprehensive and contemporaneous analysis of TTI across
early-stage solid tumors treated with curative-intent approaches in the US to address these
knowledge gaps. The objectives were to investigate trends in TTI, identify determinants of
increased TTI and to evaluate the relationship between TTI and overall survival using hospi-
tal-based data from the National Cancer Database (NCDB) for newly diagnosed breast, pros-
tate, lung, colorectal, renal and pancreas cancer patients.
Methods
The study cohort was obtained in de-identified form from the NCDB, a hospital-based, pro-
spectively collected nationwide oncology outcomes database [21]. The NCDB collects data
annually from tumor registries of Commission on Cancer-accredited programs, comprising
approximately 70% of all new US invasive cancer diagnoses. Data collection is standardized
based on the Facility Oncology Registry Data Standards (FORDS). For this study, patients
diagnosed between 2004–2013 with stages I-III breast, stages I-III colorectal, stages I-III pros-
tate, stages I-II non-small cell lung cancer, stages I-III renal cancers and stages I-II pancreas
cancers were identified (S1 Fig). This research was approved (exempted) by the Institutional
Review Board of the Taussig Cancer Institute, Cleveland Clinic. We chose the four most com-
mon solid tumors amongst men and women; in addition, we included renal and pancreas can-
cers as less common solid tumors representative of cancers with excellent and poor cure rates,
respectively. Patients were excluded if no treatment was given, first treatment occurred > 180
days after diagnosis, interval could not be determined, uncommon histology or uncommon
presentations, such as male breast cancer.
Study definitions
TTI was calculated by NCDB using dates of initial cancer diagnosis and earliest cancer-
directed treatment. Date of initial diagnosis was defined as the first date a cancer diagnosis was
clinically or histologically established per FORDS definition. Transfer of care was defined as
initial treatment received at a facility other than the diagnostic facility. Pathologic American
Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) stage was used unless unavailable in which case clinical
stage was used. Overall survival was measured from date of first treatment to death or last fol-
low-up and was not available for patients diagnosed in 2013. The NCDB censors facility type
for all patients under age 40 years (2.2% of patients in our study population). These patients

 were excluded from the analysis when calculating facility type. We used the Charlson Deyo
Index, a modified Charlson comorbidity score based on International Classification of Disease,
9th Edition (ICD-9-CM) coding to assess the severity of preexisting comorbidities (the num-
ber of coexisting medical conditions weighted according to their relative effects on survival).
The education quartile was derived as follows: educational attainment for each patient’s area of
residence was estimated by matching the zip code at time of diagnosis against the 2012 Ameri-
can Community Survey data, spanning years 2008¬2012. This provides a measure of the num-
ber of adults in the patient’s zip code who did not graduate from high school, and is
categorized as equally proportioned quartiles amongst all US zip codes.
Statistical analysis
Statistical analyses evaluated associations between TTI and patient attributes observed at diag-
nosis, as well as explored TTI for associate with overall survival. Categorical factors were sum-
marized as percentages and continuous factors were summarized as medians and interquartile
ranges (IQR). Overall survival is described by the Kaplan-Meier method for various durations
of TTI with thresholds of 4, 6, 8 and 10 weeks. Durations of TTI extending beyond 6 weeks are
considered delayed in the analysis. The initial statistical analysis plan is provided as a supple-
mental file (S1 Statistical Analysis Plan).
The Cox proportional hazards model was used for uni- and multiple regression analyses of
overall survival. For categorical factors, underlying assumption of proportionality was assessed
by plotting log(-log(survival)) x log(time) for each level of the factor and examining the curves
for departures from parallelism. For continuous factors the assumption was assessed by plot-
ting Schoenfeld residuals over time, fitting a LOESS line with a 95% confidence band to the
points and visually checking to see if the band consistently included a similar approach was
used to assess the suitability of using a linear form of these factors in the Cox model; i.e. Mar-
tingale residuals were plotted against the factor, a LOESS line with 95% confidence band was
fit to the points and the band was visually checked for departures from 0.To account for het-
erogeneities in clinical protocols by disease staging, separate analyses were performed for each
cancer type and stage combination. In addition, to account for any inherent time effects all
models were stratified by year of diagnosis.
Univariate hypothesis testing to identify categorical-level factors associated with TTI used Wil-
xocon rank sum or Kruskal-Wallis tests. Continuous patient attributes were evaluated for correla-
tion with TTI based on the Spearman-rank correlation coefficient. The variance of TTI was
generally larger than the mean value suggesting overdispersion and therefore negative binomial
regression was used for multiple regression analyses. To obtain the expected mean TTI associated
with a particular level of a factor expected mean effects were calculated and averaged across all
possible combinations of the other factors in the model holding the specified factor/level fixed. All
data analyses were performed using SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Inc, Cary NC).
Results
Study population
The study population comprised 3,672,561 patients of whom 37.2% of patients had breast can-
cer, 25.7% had prostate cancer, 18.0% had colorectal cancer, 9.9% had non-small cell lung can-
cer, 7.2% had renal cell cancer, and 1.9% had pancreas cancer. Tables 1 and 2 summarize
patient characteristics and overall 5-year survival across cancers. The majority of patients
(60.0%) were treated at community programs and a third (32.6%) were treated at academic
programs. Patients traveled a median (IQR) of 9.4 miles (4.3–21.8) for treatment. Approxi-
mately half of patients (51.9%) were insured by government programs.

 Trends in TTI
The overall median TTI was 27 days. TTI increased significantly across various cancers over
study duration (Fig 1, S1 Table), from an overall median of 21 days in 2004 to a median of 29
days in 2013 (P<0.001). Cancers with the greatest increase in median TTI included breast and
prostate [absolute increase of 10 days for each—breast: 18 to 28 days (55.6% relative increase);
prostate: 50 to 60 days (20.0% relative increase)]. Increase in median TTI was also seen in non-
small cell lung (absolute increase of 8 days, relative increase 30.8%), pancreas (absolute
increase of 7 days, relative increase 46.7%), and colorectal cancers (absolute increase of 6 days,
relative increase 86%). Only median TTI for renal cancer remained stable at 0 days, although
even here patients with stages II and III disease saw median increases of 5 and 9 days,
respectively.
Predictors of increased TTI
Multivariable analyses of clinical and socioeconomic factors that could potentially be associ-
ated with TTI are summarized in Tables 3 and 4. Several predictors of increased TTI were
common to the cancers studied particularly care at academic center, race, education, prior

 pancreas cancers). Black race was associated with increased TTI compared to Whites, ranging
from an estimated increase of less than one day for colorectal cancer to 6.7 days for non-small
cell lung cancer. Transfer of facility was generally associated with increased TTI, which ranged
from an estimated mean of 6.2 days for colorectal, 7.0 for pancreas, and 11.1 for non-small cell
lung cancer, to 21.7 for renal cancer.
Association of TTI with survival
Multivariable analyses of the association of TTI with overall survival from start of treatment
(measured in weeks) after stratification by diagnosis year (in two-year intervals) and adjust-
ment for baseline clinical and sociodemographic factors, are summarized in Table 5. For the
majority of cancer sites and stages studied, increased TTI was associated with worsened sur-
vival with the exceptions of stages I-III prostate and stages II-III colorectal cancers. The largest
association was seen in pancreas and non-small cell lung cancer. Every week of increased TTI
was associated with increased risk of death by an estimated 3.0% and 2.4% in stage I and II
pancreas cancer, and 3.2% and 1.6% in stage I and II non-small cell lung cancer, respectively.
Increased TTI also associated with worsened survival in stages I and II breast and renal can-
cers. In stage I breast and renal cell cancer the risks increased an estimated 1.8% and 1.2% per
week, respectively; and in stage II disease by 1.2% in both. Increased TTI was associated to a

a median of 29 days in 2013–2014 (P<0.001).

 lesser degree with outcomes in stage III breast and renal cell cancer (0.1% and 0.3% estimated
increase in risk per week, respectively), and stage I colorectal cancer (0.5% increase per week).
Prolonged TTI (> 6 weeks) was associated with substantial worsening of survival across all
cancers with the exception of prostate (S2 Table). The most substantial associations with wors-
ened mortality were seen in patients with lung and pancreas cancers. Five-year overall survival
for stage I NSCLC was 56% (±0.2) for TTI � 6wks compared to 43% (±0.2) for TTI > 6 wks
and for stage I pancreas was 38% (±0.6) v 29% (±1) respectively (P<0.001 for both) (Fig 2, S2
Fig).
In order to address unmeasured confounding arising from association between patient
prognosis and treatment pathway, the associations identified between TTI and clinical out-
comes were re-evaluated in subgroup analyses adjusting for treatment selection. When analysis
was restricted to patients receiving surgery as first-line therapy in patients with breast and lung
cancer, the standard of care for these populations, statistical estimators demonstrated stronger
effect sizes and maintained statistical significance with p-values not exceeding 0.001(Table 6).
Discussion
We conducted a comprehensive analysis of TTI across a variety of common solid tumors and
found a substantial worsening of TTI over recent years. Increased TTI was associated with
increased risk of mortality ranging from 1.2–3.2% per week in early-stage breast, lung, renal
and pancreas cancers.
A major finding of our analysis is worsening TTI over the years of study 2004–13, with a
relative worsening of 38% across all cancers studied (range, 20% to 86%). Our findings are
consistent with a prior analysis that also demonstrated an increased TTI over the years 1995–
2005 but only evaluated surgery as first treatment [20]. Our analysis extends this by showing
persistent worsening TTI, even when all types of initial treatment are included. Prior authori-
zations of diagnostic and therapeutic modalities are increasingly being mandated [18, 19], but
we did not have access to direct or surrogate markers of this process to determine if such pro-
cesses impacted on TTI. The benefits, if any, of such mandates have not been fully studied and
our findings suggest the potential of harm to patients [16]. Notably, in our analysis, uninsured
patients who do not have to go through a prior authorization process had a faster TTI.
There were common predictors of increased TTI across various cancers studied. A particu-
larly surprising finding of our analysis was the association of lengthened TTI with treatment at
Table 5. Multivariable analyses of the association of increased TTI with overall survivala.

 an academic program. This may be a reflection of the complexity, acuity, racial profile and
insurance status of patients seen at academic centers, although our findings were adjusted for
these variables. Much is known about health care disparities by race in the US [22, 23, 24, 25],
and our finding that Black race is associated with increased TTI is discouraging but not unex-
pected. Interestingly, uninsured patients had a faster TTI. It is possible that because uninsured
patients do not have to go through prior authorization processes, TTI is somewhat abbrevi-
ated. We note the heterogeneity in TTI in prostate cancer in particular. We suspect these find-
ings may be explained by the use of active surveillance in low-risk patients, whose treatment
may be delayed for months or years and who are usually cured at that timepoint, as opposed to
those who are treated quickly because they have more aggressive disease and a correspondingly
higher chance of relapse. The NCDB does not have all the physician and patient factors that go
into decision-making about treatment versus surveillance in prostate cancer so we cannot
explore this hypothesis statistically.

Cancer Database patients with time to treatment initiation of six weeks or less was substantially higher when compared to patients with time to treatment
initiation greater than six weeks for stage I (A) and stage II (B) non-small cell lung cancer and stage I (C) and stage II (D) pancreas cancers (P<0.001 for each).

 Perhaps the most concerning finding in our analysis is the association of increased TTI
with increased risk of mortality. Prolonged TTI of over 6 weeks was associated with a 13%
absolute increase in 5-year mortality in stage I non-small cell lung cancer and a 9% absolute
increase in stage I pancreas cancer. Our findings are consistent with prior reports demonstrat-
ing an association of worsened mortality with increased time to surgery in early stage breast
cancer [5] and in patients with lung cancer with TTI over 35 days [8]. Our findings were con-
sistent across the majority of cancers studied, with the exception of prostate cancer which has
a well-known indolent natural history. Of note, the association with survival is more emphatic
in earlier stages of the cancers studied; this may be reflective of lower use of systemic therapy
in those settings [26]. In the context of findings of potential harm, we believe it is incumbent
upon insurers and health systems to simplify access and reduce operational barriers to initiat-
ing treatment. Recent initiatives have shown that TTI can be substantially reduced by multidis-
ciplinary approaches and cost-neutral interventions and such efforts need to be adopted more
broadly and with a greater sense of urgency [27, 28].
There are certainly limitations to our analysis. This was a retrospective cohort study,
although the NCDB includes a majority of cancer patients treated in the US and therefore pro-
vides assurance of external validity. We could not account for non-standard-of-care treatments
or experimental agents, although the latter constitute < 1% of treatments provided in this
dataset. To control for confounding arising from heterogeneity with respect to non-standard-
of-care treatment pathways, we implemented a subgroup analysis restricted to patients receiv-
ing surgery in first line therapy for breast and lung cancer, the standard of care for these popu-
lations. Characterizing the impact of TTI for an average patient, the subgroup analysis
demonstrated stronger association between survival and TTI which would reduce the likeli-
hood that treatment variation or non-standard treatment plays an important role in the associ-
ation of TTI with survival. Although we adjusted for available variables associated with
mortality and conducted separate multivariate analyses for each site and stage of cancer, we
cannot account for unmeasured confounders of TTI and cancer outcomes. A randomized
comparison of early versus delayed treatment would represent an ideal study design but would
not be acceptable to patients and be likely considered unethical. Finally, we could not account
for insurance authorization processes or patient preferences leading to delays in initiating
treatment.
The findings of potential harm associated with increased TTI suggest that studies of inter-
ventions designed to simplify access and navigation are warranted. Recent trials have shown
that patient navigation can have a moderate benefit in assuring timely cancer care [29, 30, 31].
Prior authorization processes for medications may contribute to delay in medication receipt
[32, 33]. The multidisciplinary nature of modern cancer care may introduce new inefficiencies;
team-based approaches have been shown to reduce time to treatment in colorectal cancer, for
instance, by as much as a third [26, 27]. Such processes need to be adopted more widely.
In our analysis of six early-stage solid tumors treated in curative settings, TTI has length-
ened substantially over recent years. Increased TTI is associated with increased risk of death in
early-stage breast, lung, renal and pancreas cancers. We believe that studies of interventions to
simplify access, ease navigation and reduce barriers are warranted to diminish the potential
harm to patients.
