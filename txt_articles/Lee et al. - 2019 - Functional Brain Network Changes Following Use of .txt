BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE:
Post-traumatic stress disorder is associated with connectivity changes in the default
mode, central executive, and salience networks, and other brain regions. This study evaluated changes in network connectiv-
ity associated with usage of High-resolution, relational, resonance-based electroencephalic mirroring (HIRREM
R
�; Brain State
Technologies, Scottsdale, AZ), a closed-loop, allostatic, acoustic stimulation neurotechnology, for military-related traumatic
stress.
METHODS:
Eighteen participants (17 males, mean age 41 years [SD = 7], 15 active duty) enrolled in an IRB approved
pilot trial for symptoms of military-related traumatic stress. Participants received 19.5 (1.1) HIRREM sessions over 12 days.
Symptoms, physiological and functional measures, and whole brain resting MRI were collected before and after HIRREM. Six
whole brain functional networks were evaluated using summary variables and community structure of predefined networks. Pre
to postintervention change was analyzed using paired-sample statistical tests.
RESULTS:
Postintervention, there was an overall increase in connectivity of the default mode network (P = .0094). There were
decreases of community structure in both the anterior portion of the default mode (medial prefrontal cortex, P = .0097) and in
the sensorimotor (P = .005) network. There were no statistically significant changes at the whole brain level, or in the central
executive, salience, or other networks analyzed. Participants demonstrated significant improvements in clinical symptoms, as
well as autonomic cardiovascular regulation, which have been reported previously.
CONCLUSIONS:
Use of closed-loop, allostatic, acoustic stimulation neurotechnology (HIRREM) was associated with con-
nectivity changes in the default mode and sensorimotor networks, in directions that may have explained the subjects’ clinical
improvements.

Introduction
Resting state MRI is a powerful tool to evaluate brain net-
work connectivity, and network studies have the potential to
provide a unified model for psychiatric disorders. Menon1 has
proposed that psychopathologies may reflect maladaptive al-
terations in connectivity within and among three core brain
networks: the default mode network (DMN), central execu-
tive network (CEN), and salience network (SN). The DMN

is associated with spontaneous, resting state brain activity, in-
cluding self-referential “mind wandering” and autobiographical
memory. The CEN is active during goal-directed and cogni-
tively demanding tasks. The SN encompasses emotional, inte-
roceptive, and autonomic processes which assign significance
to stimuli (internal or external), and has a crucial role for the
direction of attention and motivation, as well as switching be-
tween the DMN and the CEN. Typically, the CEN and SN are

 coactivated during outwardly focused attention while the DMN
is deactivated, and opposite activity patterns are observed dur-
ing inwardly focused self-referential thoughts.1
In recent years, this “triple network” model has been ap-
plied to advance understanding of post-traumatic stress disorder
(PTSD).2–4 From the clinical diagnostic perspective, PTSD is de-
fined by symptom clusters of trauma re-experiencing, avoidant
behaviors, negative cognitions or mood, and increased arousal
(DSM-5).5 In network studies of PTSD, the DMN consistently
shows altered connectivity6–12 with the anterior portion, en-
compassing the medial prefrontal cortex, being particularly
disrupted.8 DMN changes may be related to the dissociative
features of PTSD, including the loss of a stable and coherent
sense of the self. Altered CEN connectivity is also shown in
PTSD2,13 and may contribute to difficulty for top down tasks
of cognitive control including those related to working mem-
ory or emotional regulation. SN alterations in PTSD9,10,14 may
produce perceptions of stimuli (internal or external) that entail
maladaptive modes of threat sensitivity, and may interfere with
switching between the CEN and DMN,2,8,10 leading to ineffi-
cient discrimination between task-relevant and task-irrelevant
behaviors. Resting state MRI may also offer insights regarding
the effects of interventions on network connectivity in PTSD,
and reports are emerging about the use of methods such as
mindfulness-based exposure therapy.15
The objective of this manuscript is to report brain network
connectivity changes in military service members and recent

Reductions

self-reported
symptoms of post-traumatic stress, insomnia, depression, and
anxiety, as well as improvements in functional outcomes and
autonomic cardiovascular regulation (heart rate variability
and baroreflex sensitivity), in this same cohort, were recently
reported.16 Symptom reduction was durable through the
final online data collection 6 months after completion of the
intervention.
The noninvasive, nonpharmacological intervention, High-
resolution,
relational,
resonance-based,
electroencephalic
mirroring (HIRREM R
�; Brain State Technologies, Scottsdale,
AZ)17 is intended to support autocalibration of neural oscil-
lations by using algorithmic guidance to translate selected
brain electrical frequencies into audible tones in real time.
Use of HIRREM has been associated with reductions of
high-frequency (23–36 Hz) electrical amplitudes18 and greater
hemispheric symmetry.17,19 As a closed-loop process, the inter-
vention does not require conscious cognitive activity or training.
The HIRREM approach leverages insights of the paradigm
of allostasis (stability through change), which views the brain
as the organ of central command. The role of the brain is to
orchestrate operations across systems on a top-down basis, to
support optimal anticipatory behaviors at the level of the whole
organism, within an environmental context.20 A thesis of the
allostasis paradigm is that there is no single form or level of bio-
logical function which can be designated as “normal,” and that
the brain can learn to interact successfully with the new needs
of changing environments. Allostatic therapeutics aim to re-
calibrate or “de-rigidify” system behaviors to support dynamic
flexibility for adaptive and anticipatory functionality, in con-
trast to homeostatic modulation toward normative set points.
Successful allostatic intervention is predicted to entail a range
of adaptive or healthful changes in brain network connectivity.
Brain networks of interest for the present analysis included the
central executive, default, and salience, and also other regions
that have shown alterations in PTSD including the sensorimo-
tor cortex (SMC),7,9,21 visual cortex (VC),6,9 and basal ganglia
(BG).9,21
Methods
A single site, ongoing, IRB approved pilot study (Clinical-
trials.gov registration NCT03230890) is being carried out in
the Department of Neurology at Wake Forest School of
Medicine, Winston-Salem, North Carolina, USA. The objec-
tive of this study is to evaluate clinical, physiological, physical
functional, and brain connectivity changes associated with the
use of HIRREM by military service members with traumatic
stress symptoms. Funding allowed evaluation of the effect of
HIRREM on functional brain networks for the first 18 partic-
ipants enrolled, before and after the use of HIRREM over a
12-day period.16
Participants
Eighteen participants (17 males, mean age = 41 years, SD = 6.9)
were enrolled for this study. All participants were either active
duty military personnel or recent Veterans (15 active-duty, 3
Veterans, most from special operations), whose military service
was primarily since September 11, 2001. Seventeen participants
served with the Navy. The mean length of military service was
19.8 years (SD = 8.1), with duration of symptoms for 1–25
years. All were over the age of 18, and had been formally diag-
nosed with PTSD, were referred by a military medical provider
for active symptoms of traumatic stress, or received medical
treatment for symptoms of traumatic stress, with or without
traumatic brain injury. If contact was established through self-
referral, and in the absence of a formal diagnosis of PTSD,
a score of 50 points on a screening PTSD Checklist – Mili-
tary version (PCL-M) was required. Participants were recruited
through referral from military medical providers, and by word
of mouth, posted flyers, and self-referral. Potential participants
were excluded for known seizure disorder, severe hearing im-
pairment, and a need for ongoing treatment with opiates, benzo-
diazepines, antipsychotics, antidepressants (selective serotonin
reuptake inhibitors or serotonin norepinephrine reuptake in-
hibitors), sleep medications, stimulants, or thyroid hormone.
Additionally, they were asked to abstain from recreational drug
and alcohol use until 1 month after the active portion of the
study. More details regarding the cohort may be found in the
recent report on clinical outcomes.16
HIRREM Sessions
Procedures for provision of HIRREM have been described
elsewhere.17 Subjects are encouraged to relax while sitting
or reclining in a zero gravity chair. Pairs of scalp sen-
sors monitor brain electrical activity, and software algo-
rithms translate specific frequencies into audible tones of
variable pitch and timing. Each closed-loop cycle of mon-
itoring and audible tone delivery occurs within a 4–8 mil-
lisecond span. Tones are delivered via earbud headphones,
bilaterally. Each session typically consisted of a series of
5–10 protocols (90-180 minutes each), some received with
eyes open, others with eyes closed, defined by a scalp

sensor montage in conjunction with a software design selected
by the technologist.
Participants received a mean of 19.5 (SD 1.1) HIRREM
sessions, over a 12-day period. The average total intervention
time was 2,778.5 minutes (SD 315.0) with a range of 1,692-3,059
minutes. The intervention was typically administered with two
sessions per day separated by a break of at least 30–60 min-
utes. One weekend session was offered, typically on Sunday
afternoon, and there was typically only one session on Friday
morning prior to repeat outcome measures and MRI scanning.
MRI Acquisition
Brain imaging was performed using magnetic resonance imag-
ing (MRI) before and after completion of the HIRREM inter-
vention. All participants had the initial scan in the late morn-
ing or midday as part of the enrollment visit, prior to the first
HIRREM session later in the afternoon. Due to scheduling is-
sues, one participant had the postintervention MRI scan just
prior to the final intervention session, but all others had the
follow up MRI right after the final HIRREM session. Imaging
data were collected in a 3T Siemens Magnetom Skyra using a
32-channel head coil. An anatomical brain image was collected
using a Magnetization Prepared Rapid Acquisition Gradient
Echo (MPRAGE) sequence. Functional MRI (fMRI) images
based on the blood oxygenation level-dependent signal22 were
collected using a gradient echo, echo planar imaging pulse se-
quence. At each imaging session, fMRI images were collected
at rest with eyes opened focusing on a crosshair in the cen-
ter of a computer screen followed by a resting scan with eyes
closed. For both fMRI scans, the participants were instructed
to relax, lie still, and to remain awake. Results that follow focus
on the eyes open state since there were no additional significant
findings to report with the eyes closed data. The MPRAGE was
collected in the sagittal plane with the TR = 2,300 milliseconds,

 voxel dimensions = .98 × .98 × 1.22 mm, 256 × 256 voxels,
192 slices, and slice thickness = 1 mm. Images were reformat-
ted by the Siemens scanner into the axial plane with 130 slices.
The fMRI scan was collected in the axial plane and acquired
187 image volumes with the TR = 2,000 milliseconds, 35 slices,
and voxel dimensions 4 × 4 × 4 mm.
Image Preprocessing and Network Generation
All image processing was performed with SPM8 software
(http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/)
and

scripts. The MPRAGE was converted to the axial plane and
warped to Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space using
the unified segmentation method in SPM8. The fMRI data
first had the initial eight volumes removed to allow for signal
stabilization. The images were then realigned to the first image
of the series and coregistered to the structural image. Images
were then normalized to MNI by applying the transformation
from the warping procedure for the anatomical image. To limit
analyses to gray matter, only voxels which overlap with the
gray matter in the Automated Anatomical Labeling atlas23 were
retained. A band-pass filter of .009–.08 Hz was then applied in
order to remove physiological noise and low-frequency drift.24
Finally, confounding signals including the six rigid-body
transformation parameters generated during the realignment
process and three global mean time courses—whole brain,
white matter, and cerebrospinal fluid were regressed from
the functional data.25 Motion correction was performed using
the motion scrubbing methodology developed by Power
and colleagues.26,27 For both eyes opened and eyes closed
conditions, on average less than <1% of image volumes were
removed. There was no significant difference (P = .2) in the
number of volumes removed between conditions.
Network analyses were completed using MATLAB scripts.
The gray matter voxels from the preprocessed functional data
were used in the construction of voxel-wise networks for each
participant. A Pearson correlation was performed with the time
series from each voxel being correlated with the time series
of every other voxel. The resultant correlation matrices were
thresholded using the formula N = KS, where N is the number
of nodes, K is the average degree of the network, and S was set
to 2.0, 2.5., and 3.028 yielding unweighted, undirected networks
with comparable densities across subjects. Whole brain prop-
erties were assessed at all thresholds. Regional network prop-
erties were assessed using a threshold of 2.5 based on previous
research showing that S = 2.5 produces networks with size to
density ratios that are comparable to other naturally occurring
networks,29 while networks thresholded with an S greater than
3 tend to fragment.28
Network Variables
The topology of the brain networks was evaluated using multi-
ple summary variables that were extracted from the networks.
Each variable was computed for each participant across thresh-
olds and conditions. Briefly, degree (k) is a measure of the con-
nectedness of a node. It is computed by totaling the number of
edges for any given node. Global efficiency (Eglob) is a measure
of distributed connectivity in a network. It is the inverse of the
average shortest path length for each given node.30 The result-
ing value is scaled between 0 and 1, with a value of 1 indicating
that a node has direct access to all other nodes in the network.
Local efficiency (Eloc) is a measure of regional connectivity in
a network. It is the inverse of the average shortest path length
between all neighbors of a given node.30 Eloc is scaled between
0 and 1 with a value of 1 indicating that all neighbors of a
given node are also neighbors. Modularity (Q) is a statistic that
quantifies how well a network can be partitioned into individ-
ual communities, or modules, relative to a comparable random
network.31 A network community is a collection of network
nodes that are more connected to each other than they are to
other communities within the network. The Louvain algorithm
was used to maximize Q and identify the associated network
partitioning in the current study.32 Because each run of a mod-
ularity analysis could yield different results, modularity was run
100 times on each network and the run with the highest Q
value was chosen for subsequent analyses. The actual network
partitions were used for analyses of regional modular structure.
Further details about each variable and information concerning
additional network variables can be found elsewhere.33
Statistical Analyses
To assess the global topology of the brain networks, each par-
ticipant’s network metrics were averaged across the entire brain
for each threshold and condition. The global network proper-
ties were compared between pre and postintervention using a
2(pre vs. post) X 3(threshold) analysis of variance (ANOVA).
Each network metric was assessed in an independent ANOVA
and analyses were performed separately for the eyes opened
and eyes closed conditions. Note that K was not assessed at the
level of the whole brain because the thresholding procedure
ensures that the average degree will be stable across conditions
and participants for a given threshold. Statistical significance
was set at P = .05 for these and all other analyses.
As opposed to global analyses that are focused on overall
network topology, regional analyses are designed to identify
the location of key network nodes as defined by the various
network metrics. For each network metric (K, Eglob, Eloc),
the location of the nodes within the top 20% of the distribu-
tion was identified for each participant. The consistency of the
location across subjects was determined by overlapping the
maps. The resultant maps are scaled from 0% to 100% indicat-
ing the percentage of participants who had a top 20% node in
each location. Due to the fact that these metrics are typically not
normally distributed (particularly at the voxel level), this pro-
cedure is commonly used to identify the location of network
hubs.28,34,35
The regional modular structure of the entire group was deter-
mined using a statistical measure called scaled inclusivity (SI).
SI measures the consistency of a network community across
subjects by quantifying regional overlap while penalizing for
disjunction.36,37 For the current project, SI was computed for
predefined functional brain regions and subnetworks. Regions
of interest (ROIs) were used to define DMN, CEN, and the SN
to evaluate changes in the triple network. In addition, ROIs
were defined for the SMC, VC, and the BG as these sub-
networks have been shown to be the most consistent across
participants.37 The DMN, CEN, and SN were defined accord-
ing Shirer et al,38 the SMN was defined according to Hugen-
schmidt et al,39 and the VC and BG were defined according to
Moussa et al.37,38 The ROIs are depicted in Figure 1.
Statistical comparisons of the regional network properties all
used paired-sample permutation tests.40 For the network met-
rics (K, Eglob, Eloc), the maps of the top 20% nodes from each

participant were included in separate permutation tests. For
modularity, a permutation was performed for each ROI using
the SI maps from the individual participants. Average SI maps
were generated to visually depict the locations and intensities of
the key network nodes across the group. To address the signifi-
cant imbalance in sex of the participants, an additional analysis
was performed that removed the one female.
Results
Whole-Brain Network Properties
The results from the whole-brain analyses for each of the net-
work metrics are presented in Figure 2. There was an ex-
pected significant effect of the threshold for all metrics (Eglob:
F(2,16) = 2,327, P < .001; Eloc: F(2,16) = 2,957, P < .001; Q:
F(2,16) = 145, P < .001). Across all network thresholds, none
of the whole brain metrics exhibited a main effect of the inter-
vention (Eglob: F(1,17) = .46, P = .508; Eloc: F(1,17) = .071,
P = .792; Q: F(1,17) = .051, P = .824). None of the network
variables exhibited a significant interaction between threshold
and intervention (Eglob: F(2,16) = 2.21, P = .143; Eloc: F(2,16)
= 1.04, P = .376; Q: F(2,16) = .37, P = .698).
Regional Network Properties
Figure 3 shows the spatial location of the top network hubs
for (A) degree, (B) global efficiency, and (C) local efficiency
pre- and post-HIRREM. The degree maps were significantly
different between pre- and post-HIRREM (P = .007). The hubs
were consistently localized to the sensorimotor area, VC, and
the DMN prior to the intervention. After the intervention, there
are clear reductions in the hubs in sensorimotor and visual
regions. However, connectivity in the DMN tended to increase.
Maps of the high global efficiency nodes closely resembled
the degree maps. Key nodes were also located in the VC, SMC,
and regions of the DMN. Statistical comparisons revealed sig-
nificant differences (P = .009) between pre- and post-HIRREM
treatment. As with the degree, there were reductions of the con-
sistency of high Eglob nodes in the visual and motor areas and
increases in the DMN.
Regional maps of local efficiency demonstrated that sensori-
motor and visual cortices exhibited high Eloc, but with reduced
consistency compared to degree or Eglob. The area of highest
consistency of Eloc was noted in the secondary somatosensory
cortex. This region was not evident in the degree or global ef-
ficiency maps. These maps are also notable for a lack of high
Eloc in the DMN. Statistical comparisons between pre- and
post-HIRREM intervention revealed a significant difference
(P = .042). The change observed was likely driven by a re-
duction in the clustering of the SMC and an increase in the
VC. The clustering in secondary somatosensory cortex did not
exhibit notable change.
Maps showing the consistency of community structure
across the group for each
of the functional brain re-
gions/subnetworks are presented in Figure 4. Statistical com-
parisons between pre- and post-HIRREM intervention revealed
significant differences in the SMC (P = . 005) and differences
that approached significance in the DMN (P = .084). Analyses
of the remaining communities did not reveal significant dif-
ferences between pre and postintervention; CEN – P = .238,
SN – P = .588, VC – P = .741, BG – P = .847.
It has been suggested that the DMN is not a homogenous
network with the anterior (comprised of the medial prefrontal
cortex) and posterior (encompassing the precuneus/posterior
cingulate and the lateral temporoparietal areas) aspects of this
circuit being involved in different neurobiological processes.41
Given this suggestion and the growing documentation of al-
tered medial prefrontal function in PTSD,6–9 secondary anal-
yses were performed to separately compare pre and postin-
tervention community structure in the anterior and posterior
aspects of the DMN. This analysis revealed that the anterior
portion of the DMN exhibited highly significant reductions in
community structure (P = .010) following HIRREM. The con-
sistency of community structure within the posterior aspect of
the DMN did not change with the intervention (P = .668).
Findings in Men Only
Given that this study included 17 males and only one female,
all analyses (whole brain and regional) were performed again

(.01, .18), sensorimotor (.01, .33), salience (.01, .07), and visual (.01, .25).

 while excluding the female participant. Without the one
female, the significant difference in the regional maps of local
efficiency was no longer significant (P = .110) and there was
a significant prepost difference in the DMN community (P =
.030) that did not reach significance with the female included.
No other statistical comparison, either for whole-brain or
regional measures, resulted in a different outcome when
excluding the one female. Thus, the overall outcomes of this
study did not qualitatively change when the female participant
was excluded from the analyses.
Discussion
Convergent data suggest that the neurobiology of PTSD in-
volves disruption of complex brain networks. The current study
provides the first data showing changes in brain connectivity on
resting-state MRI among individuals with symptoms of military-
related PTS or PTSD, who undertook usage of an allostatic neu-
rotechnology (HIRREM) for autocalibration of neural oscilla-
tions. There were postinterventional changes in connectivity in
the DMN, sensorimotor, and visual circuits which may explain
clinical benefits reported elsewhere.16 In contrast, the present
study did not demonstrate significant changes in connectivity
at the whole brain level or in the SN or CEN as a whole.
The network degree and global efficiency analyses revealed
a general increase in DMN connectivity, which is consistent
with the premise that these subjects may have had relatively low
DMN connectivity at their baseline, as shown in other studies
of PTSD.42 In addition to the increased connectivity, the DMN
exhibited a relative decrease in community structure. Although
not directly measured, the findings suggest that the connectivity
increase in DMN was actually from an increase in connections
from the DMN to other brain circuits. If connectivity had in-
creased within DMN regions, community structure would have
increased as well. These changes in DMN connectivity after
the intervention may have reflected a therapeutic effect. Opti-
mized communication between the DMN and other brain cir-
cuits could facilitate a more coherent sense of self (eg, reduction
of dissociative or depersonalizing aspects of PTSD), and might
also be associated with improved switching between the DMN
and other circuits.26
In contrast to the increased connectivity demonstrated in the
DMN overall, other regions showed connectivity reductions. In
addition to the changes in overall number of connections and
connection efficiency, the anterior portion of the DMN and
the sensorimotor network (SMN) showed dramatic decrease in
community structure. The change in the anterior DMN com-
munity, which encompasses medial prefrontal cortex, is consis-
tent with data showing enhanced anterior DMN connectivity in
PTSD, which may contribute to performance impairment.8 For
individuals with PTS(D), a decrease in anterior DMN connec-
tivity might indicate therapeutic reduction of self-referencing
or mind-wandering. The decrease in SMN connectivity may
explain the reduction of insomnia symptoms reported by this
cohort.16 Non-rapid eye movement sleep and sleep deprivation
are shown to be associated with reduced and increased connec-
tivity of the SMN, respectively,43,44 raising the possibility that
autocalibration of the waking SMN, toward reduction of con-
nectivity, may have helped these highly vigilant and physically
trained individuals to transition to sleep states.
The findings indicate both increases and decreases of net-
work connectivity in directions that would be consistent with
symptom remediation. By focusing the intervention on the
brain, with respect for its role as the organ of central com-
mand, successful allostatic therapeutics is predicted to entail op-
timized reorchestration of functioning across systems.17,45 The
allostatic strategy is to go upstream to the source of pathogene-
sis, to facilitate adaptive variability of set points across subsys-
tems downstream. Studies have also indicated that this allostatic
neurotechnology may be therapeutic for postural orthostatic
tachycardia syndrome,46 sport-related concussion,47 and other
conditions.18,48
Several features or limitations of this study should be
noted. Some of the participants did not necessarily endorse a
clinical diagnosis of PTSD, and all but one was male. We be-
lieve that studies of military traumatic stress should continue to
enroll individuals who are not necessarily treatment-seeking, as
has been recommended given the widespread reality of symp-
tom under-reporting.49 It is also important for future research
to evaluate network changes in women, who are increasingly
integrated into the armed forces. Because this study did not
include a control group, it is not possible to quantify what por-
tion of the network connectivity changes may have been due to
usage of the neurotechnology intervention as such, rather than
nonspecific treatment factors including subjective expectation
and overall participation in a study intervention over 12 days.
Nonetheless, the durability of the clinical improvements (to
6 months) as well as the autonomic cardiovascular changes re-
ported elsewhere16 is not consistent with regression to the mean,
the natural history of PTS(D) symptomatology, or typical char-
acteristics of the placebo response. The statistical significance
for the changes in the DMN (including anterior portion) as well
as the SMN, corresponding to data that associate these regions
to PTSD symptomatology and sleep respectively, suggests that
those changes were due to intervention effects rather than nat-
ural variability in network connectivity. Most participants were
affiliated with special operations, and their unique training and
experiences may have influenced the results. Finally, the major-
ity of participants reported recognized traumatic brain injuries,
which can also alter brain networks.
In conclusion, we report changes in brain network con-
nectivity that are consistent with remediation of symptoms
of PTS(D), for a cohort of mostly male special operation of-
ficers who undertook usage of an allostatic, closed-loop acous-
tic stimulation neurotechnology (HIRREM) for autocalibration
of neural oscillations. Postinterventional changes in connectiv-
ity of the DMN including the anterior portion, as well as the
SMN, may explain their clinical improvements. Ongoing study
is strongly warranted, with continued and increasing attention
to participant characteristics including enrollment of women,
the role of nonspecific treatment factors, test-retest reliability of
connectivity measures, and inclusion of additional analyses that
will allow correlation to clinical and physiological outcomes.
