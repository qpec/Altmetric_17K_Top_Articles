Purpose
Obesity is an established risk factor for clear cell renal cell carcinoma (RCC); however, some reports
suggest that RCC developing in obese patients may be more indolent. We investigated the clinical
and biologic effect of body mass index (BMI) on treatment outcomes in patients with metastatic
RCC.
Methods
The impact of BMI (high BMI: $ 25 kg/m2 v low BMI: , 25 kg/m2) on overall survival (OS) and
treatment outcome with targeted therapy was investigated in 1,975 patients from the International
Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma Database Consortium (IMDC) and in an external validation cohort of
4,657 patients. Gene expression profiling focusing on fatty acid metabolism pathway, in The Cancer
Genome Atlas data set, and immunohistochemistry staining for fatty acid synthase (FASN) were also
investigated. Cox regression was undertaken to estimate the association of BMI with OS, adjusted
for the IMDC prognostic factors.
Results
In the IMDC cohort, median OS was 25.6 months (95% CI, 23.2 to 28.6) in patients with high BMI
versus 17.1 months (95% CI, 15.5 to 18.5) in patients with low BMI (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.84; 95%
CI, 0.73 to 0.95). In the validation cohort, high BMI was associated with improved OS (adjusted
hazard ratio, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.74 to 0.93; medians: 23.4 months [95% CI, 21.9 to 25.3 months] v
14.5 months [95% CI, 13.8 to 15.9 months], respectively). In The Cancer Genome Atlas data set
(n = 61), FASN gene expression inversely correlated with BMI (P = .034), and OS was longer in the
low FASN expression group (medians: 36.8 v 15.0 months; P = .002). FASN immunohistochemistry
positivity was more frequently detected in IMDC poor (48%) and intermediate (34%) risk groups
than in the favorable risk group (17%; P-trend = .015).
Conclusion
High BMI is a prognostic factor for improved survival and progression-free survival in patients with
metastatic RCC treated with targeted therapy. Underlying biology suggests a role for the FASN
pathway.

INTRODUCTION
Obesity is an established risk factor for kidney
cancer.1-3 However, large surgical cohorts and one
meta-analysis of 20 studies have demonstrated
that renal cell carcinomas (RCCs) occurring in
obese patients are associated with a lower stage
and grade at presentation and thus may be as-
sociated with an improved cancer-specific sur-
vival in a population with localized RCC.4
In metastatic disease, data suggest that,
similar to localized disease, obese patients treated
with targeted therapies have a better overall
survival (OS), even after adjusting for prognostic
factors, such as the International Metastatic Renal
Cell Carcinoma Database Consortium (IMDC)
risk criteria.5 From a biologic standpoint, a recent
report from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)
data set identified no specific DNA alterations
in clear cell RCC (ccRCC) developing in obese
patients.6 However, gene expression profiling

 identified altered fatty acid (FA) pathways in obese patients relative
to normal-weight patients, with marked downregulation of fatty
acid synthase (FASN). FASN expression has previously been re-
ported to be associated with poor prognosis in several tumor types,
including RCC,7,8 and is considered a metabolic oncogene in other
tumor models, such as prostate cancer.9 The current work focuses
on investigating the associations of BMI with treatment outcomes
in metastatic RCC (mRCC) treated with targeted therapies in two
distinct, well-annotated cohorts and elucidating the underlying
biologic mechanisms by investigating the role of the FASN pathway
in patients with mRCC using two unique specimen repositories.
METHODS
Study Populations and Data Collection
IMDC cohort. The IMDC is a consecutive patient series from in-
stitutions in North America, Europe, and Asia.10,11 This population in-
cludes patients with mRCC who received targeted therapy (TT), such as
vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)/VEGF receptor and mam-
malian target of rapamycin inhibitors, starting from 2003. Patients may
have been treated on or off clinical trials. For this study, we included
patients with weight and height data recorded at the initiation of first-line
TT. Baseline clinical and laboratory data were retrospectively collected on
all patients using a uniform database template to ensure consistent data
collection. Laboratory values were standardized against institutional upper
limits of normal and lower limits of normal values when appropriate. We
collected survival data from patient medical records or publically available
records. Institutional review board approval was obtained from each par-
ticipating center.
Validation cohort. As an independent validation data set, we con-
ducted a pooled analysis of prospective data of patients with mRCC
treated in phase II (NCT00054886, NCT00077974, NCT00267748,
NCT00338884, NCT00137423) and III trials (NCT00083889, NCT00065468,
NCT00678392) sponsored by Pfizer involving sunitinib, temsirolimus, and
axitinib. We identified 4,657 patients treated for mRCC between January
2003 and December 2013 with BMI recorded at trial therapy initiation.
TCGA samples. To investigate biologic differences associated with
different BMI groups, we used available genomic data of mRNA expression
from patients who were part of the Kidney Renal Clear Cell Carcinoma
clinical TCGA consortium (cTCGA). The cTCGA consists of 324 patients
from five participating institutions with additional clinical and treatment-
related data. All genomic data were downloaded through the TCGA data
portal12 and linked with patient characteristics. In the overall ccRCC
TCGA data set, 61 patients with metastatic disease, with available in-
formation on both FASN expression and BMI, were included in this
analysis. In addition, survival information and FA pathway score13,14 were
investigated in 324 cTCGA participants with ccRCC.
IMDC biospecimen repository. Samples from pretreatment primary
tumors and/or metastatic lesions of patients treated at Dana-Farber/
Harvard Cancer Center for mRCC with TT and part of the IMDC bio-
specimen repository were used to construct two tissue microarrays con-
taining four tumor tissue cores per case. The objective was to explore the
association between FASN immunohistochemistry staining with BMI and
clinical outcomes. IHC was performed according to protocol detailed in
the Appendix (online only).
The FASN scoring system was assessed by a senior pathologist
(S. Signoretti) blinded to the BMI status and used a combined score
(ranging from 0 to 300) defined as the percentage of positive cells (0 to
100) multiplied by the intensity (0 to 3) for each tissue core for each
patient. The maximum combined score across the cores was used for
each patient. If the maximum score was . 0, then the case was defined
as positive. Any case with a null combined score in all cores was defined
as negative.
Statistical Analysis
BMI was defined as the ratio of weight (in kilograms) divided
by the squared height (in meters). Patients were classified into BMI
groups defined by the World Health Organization: underweight (BMI
, 18.5 kg/m2), normal weight (BMI, 18.5 to , 25 kg/m2), overweight
(BMI, 25 to , 30 kg/m2), and obese (BMI $ 30 kg/m2) or condensed to
high BMI ($ 25 kg/m2) versus low BMI (, 25 kg/m2).
The primary clinical outcome was OS. For the IMDC cohort, OS was
defined as the time period between TT initiation and the date of death, or it
was censored on the day of the last follow-up visit. Time to treatment
failure (TTF) was defined as the time period between treatment initiation
and progression, drug cessation, or death, or it was censored at the last
follow-up. Progression was determined according to clinical criteria or
radiographic criteria using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid
Tumors (RECIST). For the validation data set, OS was calculated from
study randomization or trial therapy initiation to death from any cause or
censored at time of analysis. Progression-free survival (PFS) was defined
similarly but included both progression (per RECIST) and death as events,
whichever came first. For the cTCGA samples, OS was calculated from date
of TT to death or date of last contact. The distributions of OS, TTF, and
PFS were estimated with the Kaplan-Meier method along with 95% CIs.
Statistical analysis methods are detailed in the Appendix. For the IMDC
cohort, all multivariable Cox regressions were adjusted for the IMDC
prognostic risk factors and stratified on study region (Asia, North
America, and Europe) and sex, given the different distributions of
BMI across region and sexes. For a subset of the IMDC cohort (n = 787
from six centers), we also examined TTF from different causes by
a competing risk model. The cumulative incidence functions of time
to treatment discontinuation because of disease progression, death,
toxicity, and other were estimated and compared among BMI groups
using Gray’s test with adjustment for the IMDC risk groups. For the
validation cohort, the multivariable Cox regression models were adjusted
for known prognostic factors in mRCC10,15,16 as well as additional po-
tential confounding factors associated with lipid metabolism, such as
baseline dyslipidemia and statin use.17
FASN gene expression was used as a continuous variable; comparison
between BMI groups was conducted by Kruskal-Wallis test. FASN ex-
pression was also dichotomized at the median value for correlation with
OS. In addition, to further explore the role of FA metabolism in ccRCC, we
investigated a predefined gene set of 168 genes of the FA metabolism from
the reactome pathway database13,14 in the entire TCGA ccRCC using
single-sample gene set enrichment analysis.18 Subsequently, the population
was dichotomized at the FA pathway score means, and we examined the
association of the score with OS using the log-rank test.
RESULTS
IMDC Population
A total of 1,975 patients from 19 centers were included;
patients were followed until January 2013. Overall, 1,190 (60%)
patients were overweight or obese (BMI $ 25 kg/m2) and 785 (40%)
patients had normal weight or were underweight (BMI , 25 kg/m2).
Patient characteristics are presented in Table 1. At the time of data
analysis, 1,671 (85%) patients had stopped first-line TT. Median
time on first-line TT was 7.2 months (range, 0+ to 82+ months).
Median OS after initiation of TTwas 21.5 months (95% CI, 20.1 to
23.3 months). Median follow-up (n = 754; 38%) was 21.1 months
(range, 0 to 102.7 months). The majority of patients (94.5%)
received first-line VEGF axis TT. Furthermore, 921 patients also
received second-line therapy; 735 (80%) patients had weight
recorded at the start of second-line therapy. Among these,
438 (60%) patients had an overweight/obese BMI and 297 (40%)

 patients had a normal/underweight BMI. The type of TT was
balanced between high and low BMI groups in both first- and
second-line settings (Appendix Table A1, online only).
Patients with high BMI had prolonged OS compared with
patients with low BMI (25.6 months [95% CI, 23.2 to 28.6 months] v
17.1 months [95% CI, 15.5 to 18.5] months; Fig 1A) and the adjusted
hazard ratio was 0.84 (95% CI, 0.73 to 0.95) in Cox regression ad-
justed for the IMDC prognostic factors (Table 2). In addition, the
association of BMI with OS was present in the intermediate and
poor risk groups (hazard ratio [HR], 0.73 [95% CI, 0.62 to 0.87]
and 0.80 [95% CI, 0.65 to 0.97], respectively) but not in the favor-
able group (HR, 1.05 [95% CI, 0.73 to 1.51]; P-interaction = .22).
Patients with high BMI had improved TTF compared with the low
BMI group in both first- and second-line therapy after adjustment
for the IMDC prognostic factors (Table 3; Fig 1C).
Reason for discontinuation of first-line therapy was available
from six centers (n = 787). Six hundred sixty-seven patients had
discontinued treatment: 353 (53%) due to disease progression or
death, 129 (19%) due to toxicity, and 185 (28%) due to other or
unknown reason. The estimated cumulative incidence of TTF at
1 year due to toxicity was similar between the low BMI (15% [95%
CI, 12% to 19%]) versus high BMI group (13% [95% CI, 10% to
17%]). Cumulative incidence of treatment failure due to pro-
gression or death favored the high BMI group (40% [95% CI,

BMI Investigation in mRCC
 35% to 45%] v 28% [95% CI, 23% to 32%] at 1 year; adjusted
P = .0015), after adjustment for the IMDC risk groups (Appendix
Fig A1, online only).
When BMI was analyzed as four groups, the underweight
patients had poorer OS when compared with the normal BMI
group (n = 719; 36%), but only 66 patients (3%) were un-
derweight. Outcomes were similar for the overweight (n = 663;
34%) and obese (n = 527; 27%) groups; both groups tended
to have prolonged TTF and OS (Appendix Table A2, online
only).
Validation Cohort
This independent data set included 4,657 patients with mRCC
treated in clinical trials in the era of TT. Overall, 2,828 patients
(61%) had a high BMI and 1,829 (39%) patients had low BMI.
Population characteristics are presented in Table 1. The majority of
patients (n = 2,990; 64.2%) received first-line therapy and 1,667
(n = 1,667; 35.8%) received second-line therapy. Patients were treated
with VEGF receptor–tyrosine kinase inhibitor (n = 3,071) or
mammalian target of rapamycin–containing regimen (n = 1,044)
or interferon alfa-2a alone (n = 542).
Overall, the results were similar to those seen in the IMDC
cohort (adjusted HR, 0.83 [95% CI, 0.74 to 0.93] for OS; adjusted
HR, 0.82 [95% CI, 0.75 to 0.90] for PFS) in favor of the high BMI
group (Tables 2 and 3; Figs 1B and 1D). Overall response rate was
higher in patients with high BMI than in patients with low BMI:
25.3% versus 17.6% (adjusted odds ratio, 1.53 [95% CI, 1.26 to
1.86]). Results were also similar when stratified by line of therapy.
Treatment discontinuation due to adverse events was similar in
the high BMI (14.1%) and low BMI groups (14.2%). When BMI
was analyzed as four groups, the underweight patients had poorer

 OS when compared with the normal BMI group, but only 63
patients (2%) and 72 patients (4%) were underweight in first and
second line, respectively. Outcomes were similar for the over-
weight and obese groups; both groups tended to have prolonged
PFS and OS both in first and second line (Appendix Table A3,
online only).
TCGA Analysis
We identified 61 patients with mRCC in the ccRCC cTCGA
cohort (Appendix Table A4, online only). Overall, 39 patients
(63.9%) had a high BMI and 22 patients (36.1%) had a low BMI.
Median BMI was 27 kg/m2 (range, 17 to 43 kg/m2). Overall, 50
deaths had occurred at the time of analysis. Median survival was
19.2 months (95% CI, 15.6 to 31.2 months). There was a trend
toward an association between OS and BMI category (median, 25.2
v 14.5 months for high BMI and low BMI, respectively; log-rank
P = .07). Patients with high BMI had lower FASN expression
compared with the low BMI group (P = .03; Fig 2A). High FASN
was associated with worse OS (median, 15.0 v 36.8 months for high
FASN and low FASN, respectively; log-rank P = .002; Fig 2B). In the
overall ccRCC TCGA cohort (patients with metastatic and non-
metastatic disease), data were available on both survival and FA
pathway score for 324 TCGA participants. Five-year OS was 53%
(95% CI, 45% to 61%) in patients with an FA pathway score below
the mean versus 72% (95% CI, 65% to 81%) in patients with FA
pathway score above the mean (P , .001).
FASN Immunohistochemistry Staining
Finally, we investigated the relationship between FASN IHC
expression and BMI using samples from the IMDC biospecimen
cohort. We used tissue microarrays from a total of 146 patients with
mRCC treated with TT (Appendix Table A5, online only). At the time
of analysis, 122 deaths had occurred (84%). Median OS from start of
systemic therapy was 21.5 months, (95% CI, 17.6 to 28.1 months).
FASN staining positivity was recorded in 45 cases (31%)
overall (Appendix Fig A2, online only). FASN positivity was more
frequently detected in poor (11 of 23, 48%) and intermediate (20 of
59, 34%) risk groups compared with the favorable risk group (5 of

 30, 17%; P-trend = .02). When stratified by FASN IHC expression,
OS was 27.5 months (95% CI, 19.3 to 36.7 months) in FASN-
negative patients versus 14.5 months (95% CI, 10.4 to
20.5 months) in FASN-positive patients (HR, 1.71 [95% CI,
1.17 to 2.51]; P = .005; Fig 3). However, the adjusted HR of
FASN was reduced to 1.28 (95% CI, 0.84 to 1.95) in the
multivariable model, with adjustment of IMDC risk group and
BMI (Table 4). By contrast, BMI remained associated with OS
when adjusted for IMDC risk groups and FASN (adjusted HR,
0.44 [95% CI, 0.29 to 0.66]), and this association was seen in
both FASN-negative (HR, 0.39 [95% CI, 0.24 to 0.64]) and
FASN-positive groups (HR, 0.55 [95% CI, 0.27 to 1.13];
P-interaction = .434).
DISCUSSION
We investigated the prognostic significance of BMI in two large
distinct cohorts of patients with mRCC treated in the modern
therapy era. We demonstrated that patients with high BMI had
a more favorable survival outcome than patients with low BMI.
This finding is consistent in the first- and second-line settings

 for all end points examined including OS, even after adjust-
ment
for IMDC prognostic criteria
and other
baseline
characteristics.
In 2010, we first reported the potential correlation between
high BMI and favorable outcome in 475 patients with mRCC
included in the IMDC.5 Subsequently, two cohorts of patients with
mRCC investigated the role of visceral and subcutaneous fat areas
with inconsistent results for the prognostic value of these com-
puted tomography measures.19,20
Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain the
apparent “obesity paradox” and include the opposite effects
hypothesis, detection bias, reverse causation, and collider
stratification bias.21-23 Most recently, Nishihara et al24 suggested
that the inverse association between BMI and mortality among
certain disease subgroups can be reconciled by disease heteroge-
neity; that is, the longer survival among obese compared with
normal-weight patients is due to a less aggressive disease subtype.25
Our findings support this hypothesis, because FASN gene ex-
pression was downregulated in obese patients compared with
patients with normal BMI, and higher FASN expression was as-
sociated with worse survival. To explore the underlying biology,
we focused on the lipogenesis pathway. The process by which
tumors undergo de novo biogenesis of FA irrespective of the
levels of circulating lipids is called neoplastic lipogenesis.26,27 An
upregulation of FASN represents a nearly universal phenotypic
alteration in most human malignancies, potentially conferring
a survival growth advantage to tumor cells. However, the relation
between obesity, FASN, and outcome seems tumor specific.7,28
A large TCGA investigation confirmed that FASN upregulation
is associated with worse cancer-specific survival for ccRCC.6 In
fact, FASN is downregulated in obese patients in contrast with
normal-weight patients.6 Regulation of FASN is controlled by
several upstream proteins of lipid homeostasis.29-31 Preclinical
models have established that regulation of lipid composition by
sterol regulatory element binding transcription factor 1 is es-
sential to support cell survival and tumor growth.32 In the
current report, we identified an association between FASN gene
expression and BMI and subsequently between FASN gene ex-
pression and outcome in patients with mRCC from the TCGA
cohort. We further conducted a pathway analysis within the
entire TCGA cohort, which suggested a prognostic role of the
FA pathway in ccRCC. In line with these results, we found that
FASN protein levels determined by IHC were associated with
survival and with the IMDC risk groups in patients with mRCC
treated with TT.
We believe this work provides insight to further explore
both the biology and ultimately the therapeutic approaches in
patients with advanced RCC. In glioblastoma preclinical models,
inhibiting FASN with orlistat, a lipase inhibitor, induced autophagy
and apoptosis and raised the question of potential therapeutic
development.33 Orlistat also inhibits the thioesterase domain of
FASN.34 Interestingly, preclinical models of pharmacological in-
hibition of FASN can reduce RCC tumor growth in vitro.35
Our study is not without limitations, which include the use of
BMI as a single morphometric parameter. BMI is a convenient
measurement for a large study but may not provide information on
fat repartition that would be obtained through computed to-
mography assessment. BMI was dichotomized to translate in
clinically routinely used assessment; specific outcomes analysis in
morbidly obese patients was not performed, nor was the in-
vestigation of BMI changes during the course of therapy. Second is
the lack of metabolic biomarkers such as leptin or adiponectin to
investigate the role of adipokines in the relation between BMI and
prognosis. However, we believe that the size of the two clinical data
sets as well as the ability to adjust for the known prognostic factors
provide consistent results with different clinical outcomes mea-
sures. In addition, the hypothesis raised by the TCGA data set on
the prognosis role of FA metabolism in patients with mRCC was
further investigated in a unique data set of patients treated with TT
with available tissue from the IMDC cohort.
In conclusion, in two large and distinct clinical data sets, we
demonstrate that BMI affects mRCC clinical outcomes even after
adjustment for known prognostic factors. Biologically, we used
tumors from patients with mRCC from the ccRCC TCGA and
from the IMDC data sets and showed that FASN pathway acti-
vation (FASN gene expression and IHC staining) is associated with
BMI and survival. This suggests an integral role for FA metabolism
in the prognosis of patients with mRCC and lays the groundwork
for future therapeutic interventions that target the FASN pathway.

Appendix
Immunohistochemistry
Immunohistochemistry was performed on 4-mm-thick tissue microarray sections, which were initially deparaffinized,
rehydrated, and heated with a pressure cooker to 125°C for 30 seconds in citrate buffer for antigen retrieval and then incubated with
peroxidase (S2003; Dako, Carpinteria, CA) and protein blocking reagents (X0909; Dako) each for 5 minutes. Sections were then
incubated with anti–fatty acid synthase antibody (1:50; 3189; Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA) for 1 hour at room temperature followed
by incubation with SignalStain Boost detection reagent (8114; Cell Signaling) for 30 minutes. All sections were developed using the
DAB chromogen kit (3468; Dako) for 2 minutes and then lightly counterstained with hematoxylin.
Statistical Analyses
The statistical analyses were performed using SAS version 9.3 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). For the International Metastatic Renal
Cell Carcinoma Database Consortium (IMDC) cohort, the association between the body mass index (BMI) groups and other
patient and disease characteristics was evaluated using the x2 test for categorical variables or Cochran-Armitage trend test for
ordered BMI groups if appropriate. Differences between the BMI groups were examined with the log-rank test or the Wald x2 test
from the Cox regression. To report the associations of BMI with overall survival and progression-free survival from the large IMDC
and validation cohorts, we focused on the magnitude and precision of associations, rather than P values from test statistics to claim
significance. For The Cancer Genome Atlas and IMDC specimen cohorts, two-sided P values were provided.

Estimates of the cumulative incidence of treatment failure because of toxicity did not differ between the underweight/normal and overweight/obese groups. Cumulative
incidence of treatment failure because of progression/death favored the overweight/obese group after adjustment for the International Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma
Database Consortium risk groups.
