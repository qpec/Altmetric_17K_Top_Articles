easonal influenza has a large effect on admissions to 
hospital and deaths among older adults.1,2 Influenza 
vaccination is effective in preventing visits to primary 
health care and hospital admissions for laboratory-confirmed 
influenza,3–6 but there is little research available on the effec-
tiveness of influenza vaccination on severe and fatal laboratory-
confirmed influenza.5
Age-related changes in the immune system, major chronic 
conditions and risk factors may interfere with and hamper a suc-
cessful vaccine response in older adults.7 When influenza vaccina-
tion fails to prevent illness caused by influenza, studies have sug-
gested that vaccination may still have an additional effect by 
reducing the severity of disease.5,8–13 This vaccine effect would be 
of great interest among older adults, in whom the effectiveness of 
influenza vaccination is normally suboptimal and severe influenza 
is more frequent.1,6,7
Influenza vaccination in previous seasons may retain some pre-
ventive effectiveness,14–17 and new doses may boost the preexisting 
immune memory against antigenically related strains.16,18 However, 
a negative interference between vaccination in the current and pre-
vious seasons has been described.19–22 Yet, no studies have evalu-
ated the effectiveness of repeated influenza vaccination in prevent-
ing severe influenza, although older adults may accumulate many 
doses of vaccine over the seasons. The present study aimed to esti-
mate the effectiveness of influenza vaccines that were received in 
the current and 3 previous seasons in preventing severe cases of 
influenza in older patients. We also sought to differentiate vaccine

ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND: The effectiveness of 
repeated vaccination for influenza to pre-
vent severe cases remains unclear. We 
evaluated the effectiveness of influenza 
vaccination on preventing admissions to 
hospital for influenza and reducing dis-
ease severity.
METHODS: We conducted a case–control 
study in 20 hospitals in Spain during the 
2013/14 and 2014/15 influenza seasons. 
Community-dwelling adults aged 65 years 
or older who were admitted to hospital for 
laboratory-confirmed influenza were 
matched with inpatient controls by sex, 
age, hospital and admission date. The 
effectiveness of vaccination in the current 
and 3 previous seasons in preventing 
influenza was estimated for inpatients 
with nonsevere influenza and for those 
with severe influenza who were admitted 
to intensive care units (ICUs) or who died.
RESULTS: We enrolled 130 inpatients 
with severe and 598 with nonsevere 
influenza who were matched to 333 and 
1493 controls, respectively. Compared 
with patients who were unvaccinated in 
the current and 3 previous seasons, 
adjusted effectiveness of influenza vac-
cination in the current and any previous 
season was 31% (95% confidence inter-
val [CI] 13%–46%) in preventing admis-
sion to hospital for nonsevere influenza, 
74% (95% CI 42%–88%) in preventing 
admissions to ICU and 70% (95% CI 
34%–87%) in preventing death. Vaccina-
tion in the current season only had no 
significant effect on cases of severe 
influenza. Among inpatients with influ-
enza, vaccination in the current and any 
previous season reduced the risk of 
severe outcomes (adjusted odds ratio 
0.45, 95% CI 0.26–0.76).
INTERPRETATION: Among older adults, 
repeated vaccination for influenza was 
twice as effective in preventing severe 
influenza compared with nonsevere 
influenza in patients who were admitted 
to hospital, which is attributable to the 
combination of the number of admis-
sions to hospital for influenza that were 
prevented and reduced disease severity. 
These results reinforce recommenda-
tions for annual vaccination for influenza 
in older adults.

effect on reducing the risk of admission to the intensive care unit 
(ICU) and death when influenza vaccination failed to prevent 
admission to hospital for influenza.
Methods
Study population and design
We conducted a matched case–control study in 20 tertiary hospi-
tals in Spain during the 2013/14 and 2014/15 influenza seasons.23 
The trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine was recommended 
and offered free of charge to all people aged 65 years and older. 
Patients admitted with influenza-like illness or acute respiratory 
disease in participant hospitals were routinely swabbed regard-
less of disease severity or vaccination status.
We included patients aged 65 years or older who were admit-
ted to hospital for more than 24 hours with influenza confirmed 
by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, culture or 
immunofluorescence. We excluded patients living in long-term 
care facilities, and patients who had symptom onset after being 
admitted to hospital or with unknown vaccination status.
We selected up to 3 matched controls per case from patients 
aged 65 years or older with an unplanned admission to hospital 
to the internal medicine, general surgery, otorhinolaryngology, 
ophthalmology, dermatology or traumatology services in the 
same hospital for causes other than influenza or acute respira-
tory disease. Controls were matched with each patient by sex, 
age (± 3 yr), date of admission to hospital (± 10 d) and hospital.
Data collection
A structured questionnaire was used by trained health profession-
als to collect baseline data from patients with influenza and those 
in the control group by interview and review of medical records. 
This included sociodemographic data, functional status (Barthel 
Index score), smoking, major chronic conditions (pulmonary dis-
ease, renal disease, diabetes, immunocompromising conditions, 
neurologic disease, cancer, chronic liver disease, cardiovascular 
disease, neuromuscular disease, cognitive dysfunction, rheumato-
logic disease and body mass index ≥ 40 kg/m2), other preexisting 
risk factors for influenza severity (pneumonia in the previous 2 yr 
and treatment with corticosteroids administered orally at a dos-
age of > 20 mg/d for > 14 d in the last month) and use of health ser-
vices in the previous year. We collected information from medical 
records on laboratory diagnosis, symptom onset, dates of hospital 
admission and discharge, treatment with antiviral drugs, admis-
sion to ICU and death within 30 days after admission to hospital.
Information on vaccination status, including seasonal influ-
enza vaccination in the current and 3 previous seasons, 23-valent 
polysaccharide pneumococcal vaccination and 13-valent pneu-
mococcal conjugate vaccination, was obtained from medical 
records and regional vaccination registers. Patients were classi-
fied according to influenza vaccination status in the current and 
3 previous influenza seasons in 4 categories: unvaccinated in the 
current and previous seasons (reference), unvaccinated in the 
current season and vaccinated in any previous season, vacci-
nated in the current season and unvaccinated in previous sea-
sons, and vaccinated in the current and in any previous season.
Statistical analysis
We defined patients with severe illness from influenza that 
required admission to hospital as patients who required admis-
sion to the ICU or who died within 30 days after admission to hos-
pital. This definition has relevant implications, is easy to apply 
and to compare, and has been used previously.5,8,11,12
We compared baseline characteristics between patients with 
influenza and controls, patients with nonsevere and severe ill-
ness, and vaccinated and unvaccinated patients with influenza. 
We used the χ2 and Fisher exact tests for categorical variables 
and the t test for continuous variables. We considered values of 
p less than 0.05 for 2-tailed tests as significant.
We estimated the effectiveness of influenza vaccination in 
preventing patient admission to hospital for influenza by com-
paring patients with nonsevere influenza with matched controls, 
and the total effect of influenza vaccination in preventing severe 
illness from influenza was estimated by comparing patients with 
severe influenza with their matched controls (Figure 1). In both 
analyses, we compared the vaccination status of patients with 
influenza and matched controls using conditional logistic regres-
sion to obtain crude and adjusted odds ratios (ORs) with 95% 
confidence intervals (CIs). Models were adjusted for major 
chronic conditions, previous pneumonia, treatment with cortico-
steroids, pneumococcal vaccination, functional dependence, 
and primary care and hospital visits in the previous year.
We estimated the effectiveness of crude and adjusted vacci-
nation in reducing severity of illness among patients with influ-
enza by comparing the influenza vaccination status of patients 
with severe and nonsevere influenza who were admitted to hos-
pital for influenza (case-to-case analysis) using unconditional 
logistic regression (Figure 1). The adjusted models included sex, 
age, hospital site, influenza season and all previously men-
tioned variables.
Estimates were made for the prevention of all severe forms of 
influenza, and separately for admissions to ICU and 30-day mortality. 
We estimated effectiveness of vaccination as (1 – adjusted OR) × 100.
We conducted sensitivity analyses in patient subgroups by 
sex, chronic conditions, functional dependence, time from symp-
tom onset to admission to hospital, pneumococcal vaccination 
and treatment with antiviral drugs.
Ethics approval
The study was approved by the ethics committees of the partici-
pating hospitals. Written informed consent was obtained from all 
patients who were included in the study.
Results
Description of the study population
We enrolled 728 patients with influenza who were admitted to 
hospital. Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 was confirmed in 
325 patients, A(H3N2) in 256, A nonsubtyped in 106, influenza B 
in 39 and no type was available for 2 patients. Influenza A(H1N1)
pdm09 was dominant in season 2013/14 and A(H3N2) in season 
2014/15. Of the patients with influenza who were admitted to 
hospital, 77 were admitted to ICU and 83 died within 30 days

after hospital admission. Thirty patients died after being admit-
ted to ICU. Therefore, we matched 130 patients with severe and 
598 with nonsevere influenza individually to 333 and 1493 con-
trols, respectively (Figure 1).
Baseline characteristics of patients with severe influenza did 
not differ from those of their matched controls, except for a 
higher frequency of chronic pulmonary disease, previous pneu-
monia and treatment with corticosteroids, and lower coverage of 
influenza vaccination in the current and previous seasons. 
Patients with nonsevere influenza had lower coverage of influ-
enza vaccination in the current season, but not in previous sea-
sons, compared with their matched controls. Patients with 
severe influenza had a higher frequency of cardiovascular dis-
ease, had received primary care services less often, had longer 
mean hospital stays and were vaccinated less frequently than 
patients with nonsevere influenza in the current and 3 previous 
seasons (Table 1).
Patients with influenza who were unvaccinated were admit-
ted more frequently to ICU (16% v. 6%, p < 0.001) and had more 
deaths in the 30 days after hospital admission (14% v. 9%, p = 
0.04) (Table S1 in Appendix 1, available at www.cmaj.ca/lookup/
suppl/doi:10.1503/cmaj.170910/-/DC1).
Effectiveness of vaccination for influenza on 
prevention of admission to hospital for influenza
In comparison with patients who were unvaccinated in the cur-
rent and 3 previous seasons, influenza vaccination in the current 
and any previous season was 31% (95% CI 13% to 46%) effective 
in preventing admissions to hospital for nonsevere influenza. 
Nevertheless, the estimates of effectiveness were higher for pre-
venting admission to the ICU because of influenza (74%, 95% CI 
42% to 88%) and for preventing death (70%, 95% CI 34% to 87%). 
Vaccination that occurred only in the current season did not 
show significant protection against severe influenza (–1%, 
95% CI –147% to 59%) (Figure 2).
We evaluated the effectiveness of vaccination in the current 
and any previous season using sensitivity analyses stratified by 
influenza season, influenza A virus subtype and age group, and 
the results were generally similar, with modest effect estimates 
against nonsevere influenza and greater effect estimates against 
severe forms (Figure 3).
The number of doses of influenza vaccine that accumulated in 
the current and 3 previous seasons was associated with a pro-
gressive reduction in the risk of admission to hospital for severe 
influenza (p for linear trend < 0.001), but no similar trend was 
observed for admission to hospital for nonsevere influenza 
(Table S2 in Appendix 2, available at www.cmaj.ca/lookup/suppl/
doi:10.1503/cmaj.170910/-/DC1). The effectiveness of vaccina-
tion in the current season against illness caused by severe influ-
enza increased when associated with previous vaccination, but 
no similar pattern was observed against illness caused by nonse-
vere forms (Table S3 in Appendix 3, available at www.cmaj.ca/
lookup/suppl/doi:10.1503/cmaj.170910/-/DC1).
Effectiveness of vaccination for influenza on reducing 
severity
In patients admitted to hospital for influenza, vaccination in the 
current and any of the 3 previous seasons was associated with 
55% lower odds of severity of disease (adjusted OR 0.45, 95% CI 
0.26 to 0.76), 65% of admission to the ICU (adjusted OR 0.35, 
95% CI 0.17 to 0.70) and 56% of death (adjusted OR 0.44, 95% CI 
0.23 to 0.86). However, vaccination in the current season only

showed no reduced odds of severe disease and increased odds of 
death (adjusted OR 3.35, 95% CI 1.06 to 10.58) (Table 2), which is 
consistent with a preventive effect against nonsevere influenza 
but not against severe influenza.
We evaluated the effectiveness of influenza vaccination for 
reducing disease severity in analyses stratified by season, virus 
subtype, age, sex, chronic conditions, functional status, timing of 
admission to hospital, pneumococcal vaccination and treatment 
with antiviral drugs, and most analyses supported the consis-
tency of the results (Table 3).
Interpretation
Our multicentre study comprehensively evaluated and inte-
grated the effectiveness of repeated influenza vaccination in 
preventing admissions to hospital for influenza and in reducing 
disease severity. We found that repeated influenza vaccination 
was twice as effective in preventing severe cases of laboratory-
confirmed influenza that required admission to hospital in older 
patients compared with nonsevere cases, with consistent 
results irrespective of the influenza season, virus subtype and 
age. Estimates were similar for patients admitted to the ICU and 
30-day mortality. Because vaccine effectiveness in preventing 
infection caused by influenza is not expected to be higher for 
patients admitted to hospital with severe influenza than for 
those admitted with nonsevere influenza, the greater effective-
ness observed in patients with severe influenza may be 
explained by the effectiveness of vaccination in reducing the risk 
of severe outcomes. Unlike the direct prevention of illness 
caused by influenza, the reduction in severity of illness caused 
by influenza required vaccination in the current and previous 
seasons, and showed a dose–response relation.
During these 2 seasons, the main circulating viruses matched 
the vaccine strains in Spain and other countries in Europe,24,25 
which contrasted with the low effectiveness of vaccination that 
was observed against nonsevere influenza;26 however, this was 
consistent with the greater effectiveness that we found against 
severe influenza.
The effectiveness of influenza vaccination in reducing disease 
severity may become evident by onset of less severe illness or by 
reduced progression to severe illness.8 In both cases, the effect 
would appear as a lower frequency of severe outcomes in vacci-
nated patients with influenza who were admitted to hospital than 
in those who were unvaccinated and would have been detected 
in our study.
Although protection against infection caused by influenza has 
been related primarily to antibodies, protection against severe 
outcomes may be mediated through cellular immune 
responses.27 T cells, which mediate cellular immune responses, 
can target internal proteins common to heterologous viral 
strains. This gives vaccines that induce protective cellular 
immune responses the potential to protect against heterologous 
viral strains.27,28 Cell-mediated immunity against the influenza 
virus may be impaired in older adults, and this may contribute to 
30-d mortality

with influenza who were admitted to hospital are consistent with 
other studies. High vaccine effectiveness in preventing severe 
cases of influenza was reported in the 2010/11 season in Spain, 
and vaccination was associated with a reduced risk of severe 
outcomes in patients admitted to hospital for influenza.5 A study 
in the United States reported that patients who required admis-

sion to the ICU had lower influenza vaccine coverage,9 and 
another found that influenza vaccination was associated with a 
reduction in the odds of in-hospital death and admission to the 
ICU among community-dwelling adults who were admitted to 
hospital with confirmed influenza.8 Recent studies in Spain11 and 
France12 that involved adults admitted to hospital for influenza 
reported that seasonal vaccination reduced the risk of severe 
outcomes. Our results and the results from these other studies 
suggest that influenza vaccination reduces severity of disease 
among older patients in whom vaccination did not prevent ill-
ness caused by influenza.
Influenza vaccination in successive seasons was necessary to 
prevent severe influenza that required admission to hospital in 
older adults. In seasons with suboptimal effectiveness of the 
influenza vaccine in protecting people from contracting illness 
owing to influenza, the vaccine effect in reducing disease severity 
may be fundamental. These results and those from other studies 
reinforce the recommendation of annual influenza vaccination in 
older adults.30
The strengths of our study included the multicentre prospec-
tive design, recruitment over 2 consecutive influenza seasons 
regardless of the vaccination status or disease severity, data col-
lection following a standardized protocol, vaccination status 
obtained from clinical records or vaccination registers, and inclu-
sion of laboratory-confirmed cases only. The sensitivity analyses 
showed the robustness of the results.
Limitations
The study had some possible limitations. Bias frequently affects 
case–control studies; however, the consistency of findings from 
the 2 matched case–control designs and the case-to-case com-
parison suggests a lack of relevant residual bias. The estimate of 
vaccination effectiveness in patients with nonsevere influenza 
was within the range of the effectiveness that was reported in a 
multicentre European study for the same seasons.26
Interviewers in our study knew whether the patients being 
interviewed had influenza or not, and this could have influenced 
information gathering. Nevertheless, most data were obtained

groups were included in the study when they sought medical 
treatment, which could have made them more similar in the use 
of health services. The estimates could be affected if vaccinated 
patients went to hospital sooner than unvaccinated patients; 
however, the adjusted analysis by primary health care and hospi-
tal visits in the last year, and the analysis of patients admitted in 
the first 7 days after symptom onset ruled out relevant bias.

Frail patients may be less likely to be vaccinated and more 
likely to progress to illness of greater severity. Several points 
support the control of frailty bias in our study: patients with 
severe and nonsevere influenza were similar in many characteris-
tics; the analysis was adjusted for frailty-related factors, such as 
age, chronic conditions, previous pneumonia, functional depen-
dence and previous admission to hospital;31 patients who were 
either vaccinated or unvaccinated in all seasons would be less 
prone to frailty bias, and they were the main groups compared in 
this study; and the findings were consistent in separate analyses 
of admission to the ICU and death.
Treatment with antiviral drugs may prevent severe outcomes 
in patients with influenza.32 In our study, about 90% of patients 
with influenza received treatment with antiviral drugs; however, 
sensitivity analysis involving patients with and without antiviral 
treatment found consistent results.
Although we analyzed 2 seasons and the results are consis-
tent with others from different countries and seasons, further 
studies are needed to evaluate these findings under different 
circumstances.
Conclusion
Repeated vaccination for influenza was highly effective in pre-
venting severe and fatal infection caused by influenza in older 
adults. This high effectiveness may be explained by the combina-
tion of prevented admissions to hospital for influenza and 
reduced disease severity in patients admitted to hospital for 
influenza. Because severe cases of influenza may be prevented 
by 2 mechanisms, the effectiveness of vaccination against severe 
influenza may be greater than that for mild cases, and the benefit 
of influenza vaccination may be greater than that estimated in 
previous studies. The prevention of severe and fatal infection 
caused by influenza was observed mainly in patients who were 
vaccinated in both the current and previous seasons, which 
re 
inforces the recommendation of annual vaccination for influ-
enza in older adults.
