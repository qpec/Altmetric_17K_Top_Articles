Sertraline for Preventing Mood Disorders
Following Traumatic Brain Injury
A Randomized Clinical Trial
Ricardo E. Jorge, MD; Laura Acion, PhD; Debora I. Burin, PhD; Robert G. Robinson, MD
IMPORTANCE Prevention is more effective than treatment to decrease the burden of
significant medical conditions such as depressive disorders, a major cause of disability
worldwide. Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a candidate for selective strategies to prevent
depression given the incidence, prevalence, and functional effect of depression that occurs
after TBI.
OBJECTIVE To assess the efficacy of sertraline treatment in preventing depressive disorders
following TBI.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group
randomized clinical trial was conducted at a university hospital from July 3, 2008, to
September 17, 2012, with 24 weeks of follow-up. A consecutive sample of 534 patients aged
18 to 85 years, hospitalized for mild, moderate, or severe TBI, was eligible for the study.
Ninety-four patients consented to participate and were randomized (46 to placebo and 48 to
sertraline), of whom 79 (84%) completed the study. Intention-to-treat data analysis was
conducted from July 1, 2014, to December 31, 2015.
INTERVENTIONS Placebo or sertraline, 100 mg/d, for 24 weeks or until development of a
mood disorder.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Time to onset of depressive disorders, as defined by the
DSM-IV, associated with TBI.
RESULTS Of the 94 patients in the study (38 female and 56 male; 92 white), the number
needed to treat to prevent depression after TBI at 24 weeks was 5.9 (95% CI, 3.1-71.1;
χ2 = 4.6; P = .03) for sertraline treatment vs placebo. The influence of sertraline in the course
of neuropsychological variables was not detected. The intervention was well tolerated, and
adverse effects were mild in both the sertraline and placebo groups.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Sertraline appears to be efficacious to prevent the onset of
depressive disorders following TBI. Future studies should replicate these findings in a large
sample of patients with TBI and depict their long-term physical, cognitive, behavioral, and
functional outcomes.

T
heincidenceoftraumaticbraininjury(TBI)intheUnited
States is approximately 1.7 million cases per year.1 The
prevalenceofdisabilityassociatedwithTBIrangedfrom
2.5 million to 6.5 million people, and the total annual cost of
TBI has been estimated to be $60 billion.2 These figures at-
test to the importance of TBI as a public health concern.
Depressive disorders are a common event after TBI. The
reported frequency of depression following TBI has varied
from 6% to 77%.3 Such heterogeneity is owing to differences
in recruitment settings, the methods used to assess depres-
sion, and the timing of these assessments with respect to the
index TBI.4-16
Several prospective studies have observed patients dur-
ing the first year following TBI. Two studies reported that 58
of 157 patients (36.9%) developed a depressive disorder dur-
ing this period.14,17 A larger study of 559 patients with TBI es-
timated the 1-year frequency of major depression as 53.1%,18
while another study of 102 patients with TBI found that the
frequency of major depression was 29.4%.19
The prevalence of depression continues to be high in more
chronic stages of TBI, with only a few patients recovering from
depression at 2 years of follow-up.20 Furthermore, the preva-
lence of major depression was estimated to be 26.7% in a group
of60patientsassessed30yearsafterincidentTBI.21Thesefind-
ings suggest that depressive disorders are not only a frequent
complication of TBI; they are likely to have a chronic and re-
fractory course.
One study initially reported that depressive disorders
increase disability and have a negative effect on reintegra-
tion into the community after TBI.22 This finding has been
extensively replicated by different investigators in indepen-
dent samples of patients with TBI.18,23-27 Overall, these stud-
ies emphasize the need to identify depression and treat it
accordingly.
Prevention is more effective than treatment to decrease
the burden of major medical conditions such as infectious ill-
nesses, cardiovascular disease, and cancer. This is also true in
the case of depression.28 Traumatic brain injury is a candi-
date for selective strategies to prevent depression given the in-
cidence, prevalence, and functional effect of depression oc-
curring after TBI.29
Our study examines the efficacy of pharmacologic treat-
ment to prevent the onset of depression following TBI. We hy-
pothesized that the time from baseline to onset of depressive
disorders would be greater in a group of patients randomized
to receive sertraline treatment vs a group of patients random-
ized to receive placebo. We also hypothesized that, when com-
pared with patients receiving placebo, patients receiving ser-
traline would show better performance in a set of
neuropsychological tests after 6 months of treatment.
Methods
Study Design
Thisdouble-blind,placebo-controlled,parallel-grouprandom-
ized clinical trial was conducted at the Departments of Psy-
chiatry and Neurosurgery of the University of Iowa. Partici-
pantswererandomizedtoreceiveidenticaltabletsofsertraline,
100 mg/d, or placebo once daily for 24 weeks. The study pro-
tocol is detailed in Supplement 1. The protocol was approved
by the University of Iowa institutional review board. Written
informed consent was obtained from every participant.
Study Participants
Participants were enrolled between July 3, 2008, and Septem-
ber 17, 2012. Patients between 18 and 85 years of age with a di-
agnosis of mild, moderate, or severe TBI were included in the
study. They were required to have complete recovery of post-
traumatic amnesia within 4 weeks of the traumatic episode.
Patients with ongoing depression were excluded. To be eli-
gible for the study, participants with a history of mood disor-
ders should have been in full remission for at least 1 year after
discontinuation of treatment.
Patients were randomized using a permuted blocks ran-
domization scheme. Other exclusion criteria and further de-
tails on randomization can be found in the study protocol
(Supplement 1).
Assessments
The primary outcome of this study was time to onset of a de-
pressive disorder. Diagnosis of a depressive disorder was made
usingtheMini-InternationalNeuropsychiatricInterview30and
DSM-IV criteria. Participants were evaluated in person at the
baseline evaluation as well as at the 2-, 4-, 8-, 12-, 16-, 20-, and
24-week follow-up visits. In addition, the Mini-International
Neuropsychiatric Interview was administered via telephone
on weeks 6, 10, 14, 18, and 22. If, during a telephone inter-
view, the participant reported the occurrence of the anchor
symptoms of depressive disorders in the previous 2 weeks, he
or she was evaluated in person using the same structured in-
terview. The presence of mood disorders was ascertained by
experienced psychiatrists (R.E.J. and R.G.R.) who were un-
aware of treatment allocation. In the case of patients with a
history of depression, the latter should have been in full re-
mission for at least 1 year after discontinuation of antidepres-
sant treatment. Demographics, injury characteristics, disabil-
ity, alcohol use, and psychiatric and psychosocial assessments
are detailed in the study protocol (Supplement 1).
Neuropsychological functioning was assessed with a
comprehensive battery of tests tapping the following cogni-
tive domains: focused and selective attention, working
Key Points
Question Does prophylactic administration of sertraline prevent
depressive disorders following traumatic brain injury?
Findings In this double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group
randomized clinical trial that included 94 adult patients, the
hazards for developing depression for participants receiving
placebo were about 4 times the hazards of participants receiving
sertraline treatment.
Meaning Preventive treatment may have a decisive effect in
reducing the burden of depressive disorders and improving the
recovery and quality of life of patients with traumatic brain injury.

memory, episodic memory inhibition and executive control,
and general IQ. A full description of the neuropsychological
tests that form part of each domain is included in the study
protocol (Supplement 1).
Sertraline Administration and Adjustment
Sertraline and placebo were administered in a double-blind
fashion via an equal number of identical tablets. Sertraline, 25
mg/d, was given for 5 days, 50 mg/d for the next 5 days, and
100 mg/d thereafter (Supplement 1).
Adverse Events
Participants were asked about adverse events (AEs) at 2-week
intervals (or sooner if an individual reported an AE) using a
standardized checklist developed for this study. A data and
safety monitoring board comprising investigators not in-
volved in this trial assessed aggregate AE data associated with
the 2 treatments. Sexual dysfunction was assessed using the
Arizona Sexual Experience Scale (ASEX).31
Statistical Analysis
Intention-to-treat data analysis was conducted from July 1,
2014, to December 31, 2015. A priori sample size calculations
and analyses used to describe the sample are included in
Supplement 1. To analyze the data on the time to onset of
depressive disorders, we built a Cox proportional hazards
regression model using time to onset of mood disorders as
the dependent variable and treatment group as the indepen-
dent variable. This analysis included all patients who com-
pleted the study as well as those who withdrew after ran-
domization (ie, 94 patients). The latter were considered in
the model as censored observations at the time they stopped
participating in the study. The proportional hazards assump-
tion was tested and met. The frequency of AEs happening at
least once during the study was compared between the
groups using the Fisher-Boschloo statistic for an exact
unconditional test as recommended by Lydersen and
colleagues.32 Adverse events found to be different between
the groups (at α = .10) were further examined using logistic
regression marginal models. Dependency between the AE
measures was modeled using an autoregressive variance-
covariance structure. The effect of treatment on the ASEX
scores was modeled using a similar model with an identity
link function.
Results
Participants
We screened 1053 patients aged 18 to 85 years with a diagno-
sis of closed TBI; 534 (50.7%) were found to be eligible. Rea-
sons for ineligibility included the following: 37 patients had
TBI severity that precluded evaluation or died soon after ini-
tial screening, 2 had evidence of penetrating head injury, 23
had evidence of spinal cord injury, 51 had a severe complicat-
ing medical illness, 14 had a neurodegenerative disorder, 18
had cerebrovascular illness or dementia, 145 had a diagnosis
of alcohol or drug dependence, 37 had a concurrent mood or
anxiety disorder, 20 had a concurrent psychotic disorder, 87
were already receiving antidepressants, 41 had received anti-
depressants sometime during the 6 months before the injury,
5 failed a previous trial with sertraline, 3 had AEs that caused
discontinuation of previous sertraline treatment, 7 had non-
traumatic subdural hemorrhage, 2 had a positive urine preg-
nancy test, 1 planned to become pregnant during the study, 7
had legal issues precluding study evaluation, 7 did not have
TBI, 4 were not able to complete the screening evaluation, 3
were moving out of Iowa and follow-up visits would not have
been possible, and 5 did not have a reason recorded. Of those
eligible, 440 (82.4%) were not interested in participating in the
study (66 patients were unwilling to commit to the time re-
quired for participation in the study, 20 lived too far for study
visits, 52 had their families decline participation, 120 were un-
willing to add other medication to the ones they were already
taking, 30 decided to refuse placebo and to take antidepres-
sants to improve recovery from TBI, 18 were going to a facility
that does not accept external medication or the use of re-
search drugs, 39 thought depression was not going to occur,
77 were out of reach, 2 gave legal reasons, 7 would not partici-
pate in research, 2 had jobs that do not allow them to take an-
tidepressants, 3 did not want to be reminded of the accident
owing to grief, 3 had too many health issues, and 1 patient did
not have a reason recorded). The remaining 94 patients (17.6%)
were randomized to receive either sertraline treatment or pla-
cebo (Figure 1). Most participants underwent their baseline
evaluation between 3 and 4 weeks after TBI.
Demographic Characteristics
Demographic variables are summarized in Table 1. The sertra-
line and placebo groups were comparable with regard to vari-
ables such as age, sex, educational level, marital status, and
occupational level.

Mechanism, Type, and Severity of Injury
Characteristics associated with injuries that correspond with
the sertraline and placebo groups are summarized in Table 2.
The mechanisms of injury that occurred most often in our pa-
tients were falls (45 [48%]) and motor vehicle crashes (36
[38%]).
Severity of TBI was determined using Glasgow Coma Scale
scores and the findings on their admission computed tomo-
graphic scans. Seventy-four patients (79%) had Glasgow Coma
Scale scores between 13 and 15. Of these 74 patients, 58 had
intracranial abnormalities on the results of computed tomo-
graphic scans and were classified as having moderate TBI.
Sixty-nine patients (73%) had moderate TBI, 16 (17%) had mild
TBI, and 9 (10%) had severe TBI.
Neuropsychiatric Characteristics
Baseline scores on psychiatric scales are depicted in Table 2. A
history of mood disorders was present among 6 patients (12%)
receiving sertraline treatment and in 4 patients (9%) receiving
placebo. All of these patients were in full symptomatic remis-
sionformanyyears,andtherewasnohistoryofrecurrentmood
episodes. Premorbid intellectual achievement, global mea-
sures of cognition, and scores in the 5 cognitive domains were
comparable between the groups (eTable 1 in Supplement 2).
Rehabilitation Treatment
Descriptive statistics of rehabilitation interventions and other
medications received during the study are included in eTables
2through4inSupplement2.Thesertralineandplacebogroups
were similar regarding the frequency of these interventions.
Of the 94 participants, 32 (34%) received some form of reha-
bilitation treatment, mostly physical therapy. None of the pa-
tients received cognitive rehabilitation therapy.
Time to Develop a Depressive Disorder
The number of patients needed to treat to prevent develop-
ment of depression after TBI at 24 weeks was 5.9 (95% CI, 3.1-
71.1; likelihood ratio test χ2 = 4.6; P = .03) (Figure 2) for ser-
tralinevsplacebo(eTable5inSupplement2).Allincidentcases
of depression had features of major depression. Although
symptoms of anxiety were relatively frequent among pa-
tients with depression, there were no incident cases of anxi-
ety disorders as defined by DSM-IV criteria. Suicide risk was
assessed using the suicidality module included in the Mini-
InternationalNeuropsychiatricInterview.Suicidalideationwas
observedinonly1patientwhodevelopedmajordepressivedis-
order and was allocated to the placebo group. Thus, an effect
of sertraline treatment on suicidal behavior was not detect-
able in this trial.
Longitudinal Course of Neuropsychological Test Scores
Given that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) can
enhance neuroplasticity in multiple areas of the brain that par-
ticipate in cognitive processing, we also investigated whether,
among patients with TBI who did not develop a mood disor-
der during the 6-month follow-up period, those who were
treated with sertraline had improved memory and executive
function compared with those who received placebo. Thus, we
examined whether sertraline had an effect on cognitive en-
hancement that was independent from its effect on mood.
Sixty-seven patients did not develop a mood disorder dur-
ing the follow-up period and had neuropsychological evalua-
tions at baseline and 24 weeks. The difference between the 24-
week score and the baseline score was compared between
treatments using the Wilcoxon rank sum test. Differences be-
tween the treatment group for the domains of attention, work-
ing memory, episodic memory, and executive control and in-
hibition were not detected. In addition, no influence of
sertraline treatment on speed of information processing was
detected. Similar results were obtained when we indepen-
dently examined young and older (ie, ≥55 years) patients and
whenweexaminedthegroupofpatientswhosebaselinescores
on the Mini-Mental State Examination33 were more than 1 SD
of the age- and educational level–adjusted normative mean.
Adverse Events
Adverse events reported at least once during the study have
been summarized in Table 3. Almost all patients experienced
mild or moderate AEs. One patient in each treatment group
experienced a serious AE. Both participants had a hip frac-
ture requiring hospitalization. However, these AEs were
adequately resolved and judged not to be associated with the
study medication. After controlling for the effect of time, the
odds of having dry mouth (odds ratio, 7.2; 90% CI, 1.9-27.6;
P = .01) and diarrhea (odds ratio, 2.3; 90% CI, 1.0-5.5; P = .10)
were higher for participants receiving sertraline treatment
than for those receiving placebo. Overall, sexual AEs were
mild and did not have a significant effect in the participants’
quality of life.

Discussion
Our findings suggest that sertraline given at a low dosage early
after TBI is an efficacious strategy to prevent depression after
TBI. The number of patients needed to treat with sertraline to
prevent depression after TBI was approximately 6 when com-
pared with placebo. Furthermore, the prophylactic effect was
not restricted to the few participants with a remote history of
depressive disorders. We did not observe a cognitive enhance-
ment effect of SSRIs in this group of patients with TBI. The in-
tervention was well tolerated, and AEs were mild in both the
sertraline and placebo groups. However, the frequency of dry
mouth and diarrhea was slightly higher among those receiv-
ing sertraline treatment.
The limitations of our study include the relatively small
sample size, the fact that participants were recruited at a single
emergency trauma center in Iowa City, the predominance of
mild and moderate TBI in the study group, and the scarce rep-
resentation of racial and ethnic minorities among the en-
rolled patients. In addition, follow-up was limited to 6 months
after incident TBI. Although we are aware that longer trials
might be associated with smaller effect sizes,34 previous stud-
iesontheincidenceofdepressivedisordersduringthefirstyear
following TBI indicate that approximately 80% of depressive
episodes have their onset during the first 6 months.14,17 Fur-
thermore, the first 6 months is the period when we observe
most of the recovery from brain injury and when depression
has a significant deleterious effect on functional outcome.
Taken together, the aforementioned factors limit the gener-
alization of these results.
Our results are consistent with previous reports on the ef-
ficacy of antidepressants to prevent depression after stroke.35
The fact that small doses of sertraline are efficacious to pre-
vent depression after TBI stands in sharp contrast to the lack
of efficacy of antidepressants to treat depression in the chronic
stage of TBI. Ashman et al36 did not detect an effect of sertra-
line when compared with placebo to treat depression after TBI
inagroupof41participantsenrolledinthetrialatleast6months
after TBI. A meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials exam-
ining the efficacy of antidepressants to treat depression after
TBI reported an overall effect size of Hedges g = 0.46 (95% CI,
−0.44 to 1.36; P < .001), favoring groups receiving placebo in
favor of those receiving active treatment.37 Overall, these re-
sults suggest that sertraline is efficacious to prevent the onset
of depressive disorders when administered early after TBI but
that it has a questionable antidepressant action when depres-
sive disorders are already present and follow a chronic course.
In addition, it seems likely that the smaller doses of sertraline
usedinpreventivetreatmentareassociatedwithfewerAEsthan
are the higher doses usually prescribed to treat depression.
A recent meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials of psy-
chologicalinterventionstopreventdepressionincluded32ran-
domized clinical trials with 6214 participants.34 The analysis
of the 32 trials estimated that the number needed to treat was
approximately 20. In our study, the number needed to treat
decreasedfrom14to5.9asfollow-uptimeincreased.Thisfind-
ing compares favorably with the previous research.

s preventive effect. It is increasingly recognized that en-
hanced neuroplasticity in mood regulation areas, such as the
hippocampus and prefrontal cortex, is an important part of the
antidepressant effect of SSRIs. The early stages of TBI are a sig-
nificantly stressful period in which the individual must cope
withthephysicalandpsychologicalchallengesassociatedwith
brain injury. It is plausible that sertraline can modify the ef-
fect of stress on vulnerable mood regulation circuits, model-
ingtheminawaythatpromotesmoreadaptiveresponses.Fur-
thermore, SSRIs may influence the balance between excitatory
and inhibitory neurotransmission and normalize glucose me-
tabolism in mood-regulating networks, an effect that might be
associated in part with stimulation of 5HT-2B receptors.38
Findings from animal models support the hypothesis that
antidepressants produce structural and functional changes in

depressive behaviors and increased social interaction than did
mice receiving placebo.40 These findings are consistent with
what we observed clinically in our group of patients.
In contrast to the effects observed among patients with
stroke treated with escitalopram,41 we did not observe a cog-
nitive enhancement effect of sertraline. This finding might be
associated with multiple factors, including differences in the
pathophysiologic conditions of stroke and TBI, the type of SSRI
prescribed, or the duration of therapy (escitalopram was given
for 12 months to patients with stroke). The more parsimoni-
ous hypothesis, however, argues for the presence of a ceiling
effect, as most of our patients with TBI had neuropsychologi-
cal performance within normal limits.
Conclusions
This is the first trial, to our knowledge, indicating that antide-
pressantsareefficacioustopreventtheonsetofdepressionfol-
lowing TBI. Given the prevalence and functional effect of de-
pressionamongpatientswithTBI,thesefindingshaveprofound
therapeutic implications. However, although our findings are
novel and provocative, recommending a change in the guide-
linestotreatpatientswithTBIrequiresreplicationofthesefind-
ings in multicenter studies. In addition, it would be important
to study whether combining antidepressants with behavioral
interventions, such as psychotherapy or cognitive rehabilita-
tion protocols, will optimize long-term functional outcomes.
