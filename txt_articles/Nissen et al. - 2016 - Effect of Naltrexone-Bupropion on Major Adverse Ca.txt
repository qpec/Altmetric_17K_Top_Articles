IMPORTANCE Few cardiovascular outcomes trials have been conducted for obesity
treatments. Withdrawal of 2 marketed drugs has resulted in controversy about the
cardiovascular safety of obesity agents.
OBJECTIVE To determine whether the combination of naltrexone and bupropion increases
major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE, defined as cardiovascular death, nonfatal stroke,
or nonfatal myocardial infarction) compared with placebo in overweight and obese patients.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Randomized, multicenter, placebo-controlled,
double-blind noninferiority trial enrolling 8910 overweight or obese patients at increased
cardiovascular risk from June 13, 2012, to January 21, 2013, at 266 US centers. After public
release of confidential interim data by the sponsor, the academic leadership of the study
recommended termination of the trial and the sponsor agreed.
INTERVENTIONS An Internet-based weight management program was provided to all
participants. Participants were randomized to receive placebo (n=4454) or naltrexone,
32 mg/d, and bupropion, 360 mg/d (n=4456).
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Time from randomization to first confirmed occurrence of a
MACE. The primary analysis planned to assess a noninferiority hazard ratio (HR) of 1.4 after
378 expected events, with a confidential interim analysis after approximately 87 events (25%
interim analysis) to assess a noninferiority HR of 2.0 for consideration of regulatory approval.
RESULTS Among the 8910 participants randomized, mean age was 61.0 years (SD, 7.3 years),
54.5% were female, 32.1% had a history of cardiovascular disease, and 85.2% had diabetes,
with a median body mass index of 36.6 (interquartile range, 33.1-40.9). For the 25% interim
analysis, MACE occurred in 59 placebo-treated patients (1.3%) and 35 naltrexone-bupropion–
treated patients (0.8%; HR, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.39-0.90). After 50% of planned events, MACE
occurred in 102 patients (2.3%) in the placebo group and 90 patients (2.0%) in the
naltrexone-bupropion group (HR, 0.88; adjusted 99.7% CI, 0.57-1.34). Adverse effects were
more common in the naltrexone-bupropion group, including gastrointestinal events in 14.2%
vs 1.9% (P < .001) and central nervous system symptoms in 5.1% vs 1.2% (P < .001).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among overweight or obese patients at increased
cardiovascular risk, based on the interim analyses performed after 25% and 50% of planned
events, the upper limit of the 95% CI of the HR for MACE for naltrexone-bupropion
treatment, compared with placebo, did not exceed 2.0. However, because of the
unanticipated early termination of the trial, it is not possible to assess noninferiority for the
prespecified upper limit of 1.4. Accordingly, the cardiovascular safety of this treatment
remains uncertain and will require evaluation in a new adequately powered outcome trial.

T
he prevalence of obesity has increased steadily in the
United States and globally over the last several de-
cades, and this disorder is now considered one of the
most serious contemporary threats to cardiovascular health.1
The current obesity epidemic has resulted in a substantial in-
crease in the incidence of diabetes mellitus and related
complications.2 Lifestyle modification has long been consid-
ered a mainstay of therapy for obesity, but this intervention
has produced only modest weight loss and no reduction in ma-
jor adverse cardiovascular events (MACE).3 Accordingly, treat-
ment strategies have centered on pharmacological and surgi-
calapproachestoweightreduction.Drugtreatmentsforobesity
have yielded mixed results, with pharmacological agents
achieving modest weight loss but without demonstrating a re-
duction in cardiovascular events. Two therapies, fenflur-
amine and sibutramine, were removed from the market after
evidence of cardiovascular harm emerged.4,5 Accordingly, the
medical community and regulatory authorities have ex-
pressed concerned about the cardiovascular safety of new
drugs to treat obesity.
The combination of naltrexone and bupropion reduced
weight during phase 3 clinical trials,6 but the US Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) deferred approval based on safety con-
cernsrelatedtosmallincreasesinbloodpressureandheartrate
in these trials.7 The FDA mandated a placebo-controlled, non-
inferiority cardiovascular outcomes trial, specifying that an in-
terim analysis after 25% of expected events had accrued would
need to rule out an upper 95% confidence interval of the haz-
ard ratio (HR) of 2.0 prior to approval and a HR of 1.4 at study
completion (potentially postapproval).8 Both the sponsor and
the FDA agreed to not disclose the 25% interim analysis until
completion of the study. While the trial was ongoing, the spon-
sor publicly released the confidential 25% interim results via
a patent publication.9 The study’
s academic leadership rec-
ommended termination of the trial due to the breach of con-
fidentiality and the sponsor agreed. The current report pro-
vides results for the 50% interim data, which was the last
prespecified analysis performed by the data monitoring com-
mittee prior to public disclosure. We also include the 25% in-
terim analysis and a sensitivity analysis based on the final data
available at last patient contact.
Methods
Study Design
The study was a phase 3b, multicenter, randomized, double-
blind,placebo-controlledtrialtoassesstheoccurrenceofMACE
inoverweightorobesepatientsatincreasedriskofadversecar-
diovascular outcomes treated with an extended-release, fixed-
dose formulation containing a total daily dose of 32 mg of
naltrexone and 360 mg of bupropion. Interim monitoring
boundaries allowed for early termination for either superior
efficacy or established harm but not based on noninferiority
considerations.
The study enrolled patients into a double-blind lead-in pe-
riod to identify patients who did not tolerate treatment with
low-dose naltrexone-bupropion or who exhibited poor adher-
ence. During the lead-in period, participants were randomly
assigned in a 1:1 ratio to 1 of 2 treatment sequences: 1 week of
activestudymedicationfollowedby1weekofplaceboor1week
of placebo followed by 1 week of active study medication. Eli-
giblepatientsweresubsequentlyrandomizedtotreatmentwith
either naltrexone-bupropion or placebo in a 1:1 ratio (Figure 1).
Randomization occurred via an interactive voice recognition
system using a permuted block size of 4 with no stratification
factors. To achieve the requisite number of events, the dura-
tion of randomized treatment was estimated to be between 2
and 4 years.
The trial required discontinuation from study medica-
tion at week 16 in a blinded manner for patients who did not
lose 2% or more of their initial body weight or experienced a
sustained (at ≥2 visits) increase in blood pressure (systolic or
diastolic) of 10 mm Hg or greater. The approach was selected
in consultation with the FDA to avoid administration of
naltrexone-bupropion to patients who did not lose weight or
who experienced clinically unacceptable increases in blood
pressure as suggested in the labeling for bupropion.
Study Population
The study was approved by an institutional review board for
all study sites, and all enrolled patients provided written in-
formed consent. Overweight or obese patients at increased risk
of adverse cardiovascular outcomes were eligible to partici-
pate in the trial. The study required eligible patients to be aged
50 years or older (women) or 45 years or older (men), have a
body mass index between 27 and 50 (calculated as weight in
kilograms divided by height in meters squared), and have a
waist circumference of 88 cm or more (women) or 102 cm or
more (men). Enrollment was restricted to patients with char-
acteristics associated with an increased risk of adverse car-
diovascular outcomes.
Several categories of increased risk were prespecified,
including documented preexisting cardiovascular disease.
Patients could also be enrolled if they demonstrated angina
with an abnormal graded exercise test result or exercise car-
diac imaging study (echocardiography or nuclear scintigra-
phy); an ankle brachial index of less than 0.9; or documented
50% or greater stenosis of a coronary, carotid, or lower
extremity artery. Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus were
eligible if they had 2 or more of the following: hypertension,
dyslipidemia requiring pharmacotherapy, low high-density
lipoprotein cholesterol (<50 mg/dL [1.30 mmol/L] in women
or <40 mg/dL [1.04 mmol/L] in men), or current tobacco
smoking. Patients were required to have consistent access to
broadband Internet.
Patients were excluded for a myocardial infarction within
3 months prior to screening, severe angina pectoris,
New York Heart Association class 3 or 4 heart failure, or his-
tory of stroke or blood pressure of 145/95 mm Hg or higher.
Patients were also excluded for unstable weight within 3
months prior to screening (weight gain or loss of >3%),
planned bariatric or cardiac surgery, or percutaneous coro-
nary intervention. Other key exclusion criteria were severe
renal impairment (estimated glomerular filtration rate
<30 mL/min), elevated liver enzymes more than 3 times the

upper limit of normal, long-term opioid use, history of sei-
zures or cranial trauma, mania, bulimia, anorexia nervosa,
acute depressive illness, or suicidality. Patients taking mono-
amine oxidase inhibitors within 14 days prior to screening
were excluded. Race/ethnicity was assessed by the investiga-
tor; this information was collected to determine if there were
differences in outcomes for patients with different racial or
ethnic backgrounds.
Treatments
All patients were encouraged to participate in an Internet-
based weight management program that included educa-
tional resources on healthy eating, exercise, and behavioral
modifications.Programinformationwaspresentedintheform
of weekly lessons that the study participants could access on-
line, and they also received weekly emails with healthy life-
style tips and reminders. Patients also had access to a per-
sonal weight loss coach; programs to track weight, meals, and
physical activity; and a low-fat, low-calorie meal plan.
Patients who discontinued study medication prema-
turely were encouraged to continue the weight management
program. The study medication (naltrexone-bupropion or pla-
cebo) was provided in tablet form. Each active tablet con-
tained an extended-release formulation of 8 mg of naltrex-
one and 90 mg of bupropion or placebo. All tablets were
identical in appearance. Dose escalation occurred during the
first 4 weeks of treatment, beginning with 1 tablet daily dur-
ing the first week, increasing to 2 tablets during week 2, 3 tab-
lets during week 3, and 4 tablets daily during week 4 and there-
after. Dosage levels requiring more than 1 tablet daily were
administered twice per day (morning and evening).
Outcome Measures
A blinded independent clinical events committee at the
Cleveland Clinic Center for Clinical Research adjudicated
clinical outcomes, including cardiovascular death, nonfatal
myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, hospitalization for
unstable angina, and all-cause mortality. The prespecified
primary outcome measure was time from treatment random-
ization to the first confirmed occurrence of a MACE, defined
as cardiovascular death, nonfatal stroke, or nonfatal myocar-
dial infarction. The prespecified secondary outcomes were
times to first occurrence of MACE or hospitalization for
unstable angina, fatal or nonfatal stroke, and fatal or nonfatal
myocardial infarction. The incidence of coronary revascular-
ization was collected but not adjudicated. Additional out-
come measures included changes in body weight, body mass
index, and waist circumference. Although not prespecified in
the protocol, time-weighted changes in blood pressure and
heart rate over the course of the trial were assessed. Changes
were also determined after 16 weeks of treatment, when
adherence was relatively high, to assess the peak effects of
naltrexone-bupropion on these vital signs.
Statistical Analysis
The protocol specified enrollment of approximately 9880 pa-
tients into the double-blind lead-in period, with the anticipa-
tion that 8900 would be randomized into the double-blind
treatment period. The primary analyses were performed for
theintention-to-treat(ITT)population,definedaspatientswho
underwent randomization into the treatment period and were
dispensed study medication. No imputation was performed
for missing data. Analyses were also performed for an “on-
treatment” population, defined as ITT patients who took at
least 1 dose of study medication, with censoring of events oc-
curring more than 30 days after a patient’
s last confirmed dose
of study medication.
For the primary end point, 3 null hypotheses were pre-
specified: (1) that the HR for naltrexone-bupropion relative to
placebo is 2.0 or greater; (2) that the HR for naltrexone-
bupropion relative to placebo is 1.4 or greater; and (3) that the
HRfornaltrexone-bupropionrelativetoplacebois1.0orgreater
(test for superiority). Estimates of the HRs and associated con-
fidence intervals comparing naltrexone-bupropion with pla-
cebo were obtained using the Cox proportional hazards model,
with randomized treatment as a covariate and the Kaplan-
Meier method used for time-to-event plots. Continuous mea-
surements of body weight and blood pressure over time were
analyzed using a general linear model with treatment, cardio-
vascular risk group, race, and sex as factors and with age and
baseline values as covariates. Categorical data were assessed
using the χ2 test.
An initial noninferiority analysis was planned after ac-
crual of approximately 87 events (25% interim analysis) to de-
termine whether a 2-tailed upper bound of the 95% confi-
dence interval of the HR would rule out 2.0 (testing null
hypothesis 1), in which 1.31 was the least favorable HR point
estimate consistent with this noninferiority boundary. The
study design mandated that the 25% interim analysis be pro-
vided exclusively to a core team from the sponsor to enable
regulatory filing for approval, but all personnel involved in the
ongoing trial would remain blinded to these results. The FDA
agreed to keep the interim results confidential until the trial
was completed.
Sequential monitoring for superior efficacy or harm (test-
ing null hypothesis 3) was performed by the data monitoring
committee using O’
Brien-Fleming group sequential boundar-
ies,implementedusingaLan-DeMetsαspendingfunctionwith
planned interim analyses at 50% and 75% of event accrual.10
The primary analysis of the study would be formally ad-
dressed only after accrual of 378 events (at study completion)
to determine whether an upper bound of the 95.6% confi-
dence interval of the HR would rule out 1.4 (testing null hy-
pothesis 2), in which the least favorable HR point estimate con-
sistent with noninferiority was 1.14.
The study design did not allow prematurely stopping the
trial for achievement of the prespecified noninferiority crite-
rion (HR ≤1.4) prior to study completion. The 50% interim and
final results were analyzed using 99.7% confidence intervals
based on the prespecified α spending function for testing null
hypothesis 3 after 192 adjudicated MACE.10 The 25% interim
results were analyzed using the 95% confidence intervals as
prespecifiedintheprotocol(Supplement)andstatisticalanaly-
sis plan. As a sensitivity analysis, MACE outcomes were also
reported at the time of last patient contact (after approxi-
mately 64% of planned events had accrued). No P values for

noninferiority are reported because these cannot be appro-
priately adjusted for data derived from interim analyses not
intended to serve as evidence for achievement of the prespeci-
fiedcriterionfornoninferiority.Allstatisticalanalyseswereper-
formed using SAS software, version 9.3 (SAS Institute Inc).
Sample Size Determination
The trial was designed to provide 90% power to rule out the
1.4 margin (ie, the upper limit of the confidence interval would
not exceed 1.4) when the true HR is 1.0, which required 378
primary events. The early preapproval analysis to rule out the
2.0 margin required 87 primary events to provide 90% power
when the true HR is 1.0. In both settings, a 1-sided type I error
(α) of 2.5% was used. To obtain sample sizes, an annualized
rate of primary events of 1.5% in the placebo group was as-
sumed. The recruitment was assumed to take 1.5 years, with
maximum patient follow-up of 4 years. It was assumed that
7% of the study population would discontinue during the
lead-in period, with a loss–to–follow-up rate of 1.2% annu-
ally. Under these assumptions, the trial required 3448 partici-
pants per treatment group. However, the study planned to re-
cruit 4450 per treatment group to compensate for any
deviations from the anticipated event rate or recruitment or
retention rates.
Early Data Release and Study Termination
The study’
s academic executive steering committee, data
monitoring committee, and sponsor at the time (Orexigen
Therapeutics) developed a data access plan specifying strict
confidentiality of interim data to be used in a regulatory filing
for drug approval. The data monitoring committee released
interim data to the sponsor after approximately 25% of
planned events had accrued in November 2013, and the
blinded trial continued as planned. On September 10, 2014,
the FDA approved naltrexone-bupropion for marketing but
publicly stated that the number of individuals who had
received knowledge of the interim results, both inside and
outside the company, was far greater than the agency consid-
ered essential to facilitate the regulatory submission for
approval.11 The FDA also stated that due to the breach of con-
fidentiality, the trial could not be used to meet the postap-
proval requirement to rule out a noninferiority margin of
1.4.11 Nonetheless, the FDA encouraged the sponsor to con-
tinue the trial as originally planned.
In March 2015, while the trial was still ongoing (after
sponsorship was transferred to Takeda Pharmaceuticals),
Orexigen publicly released the 25% interim results via a pat-
ent publication and submission to the Securities and Ex-
change Commission.9 The published patent claimed a method
for reducing cardiovascular risk and included the 25% in-
terim data for MACE showing an estimated HR of 0.59, which
was reported in the media as evidence of a cardiovascular ben-
efit for naltrexone-bupropion.12
The executive steering committee concluded that the pre-
mature release of interim data had compromised the scien-
tific integrity of the ongoing study, precluding successful
completion. The executive steering committee recom-
mended trial termination on May 12, 2015, and the original
sponsor (Orexigen Therapeutics) and the current holder of the
Investigational New Drug application (Takeda Pharmaceuti-
cals) agreed. The executive steering committee also decided
to unblind and partially release outcome data from a recently
completed, preplanned 50% interim analysis to correct the im-
pression of benefit created by release of potentially unreli-
able 25% interim data.13 The executive steering committee ex-
pressed concern that the breach of confidentiality through
release of preliminary data could result in inappropriate use
of naltrexone-bupropion with an expectation of cardiovascu-
lar benefit.
The50%interimanalysiswascompletedonMarch3,2015,
based on 192 adjudicated MACE (from a database lock on Feb-
ruary 3, 2015). As a result of the termination of the study, the
preplanned 50% interim analysis was considered the most ap-
propriate analysis to generate the primary results. Additional
outcomes accumulated after the February 2015 database lock
are included in a sensitivity analysis, which reports results af-
ter64%ofplannedevents.The25%interimanalysisusedinthe
regulatory approval of naltrexone-bupropion is also reported.
Results
Patients
The disposition of patients is shown in Figure 1. From June 13,
2012, until January 21, 2013, the trial screened 13 192 patients
andrandomized10 514intothelead-inperiod,and10 505were
included in the enrolled population (9 patients did not re-
ceive study medication), with 9015 patients (85.8%) success-
fullycompletingthisphase.Themostcommonreasonfornon-
completion during the lead-in was an adverse event, which
occurred in 543 patients (5.2%). Ultimately, 8910 patients were
randomized into the ongoing study, with 8905 included in the
ITT population (5 did not receive study medication).
The baseline characteristics of the patients are shown in
Table 1. The mean age of randomized patients was 61.0 years
(SD, 7.3 years), with a slight predominance of women (54.5%),
and 83.5% patients were described as white. The median body
massindexwas36.6(interquartilerange[IQR],33.1-40.9),with
a median body weight of 104.1 kg (IQR, 92.1-118.1 kg) and a me-
dian waist circumference of 118.1 cm (IQR, 110-128 cm). Type
2 diabetes was present in 85.2% of patients, established car-
diovascular disease in 32.1%, and both disorders in 17.4%. Car-
diovascular risk factors were well controlled, with a mean sys-
tolicbloodpressureof125.7mmHg(SD,12.5mmHg),amedian
low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level of 82.0 mg/dL
(2.12 mmol/L) (IQR, 65-106 mg/dL [1.68-2.75 mmol/L]), and a
median high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level of 45.0
mg/dL (1.17 mmol/L) (IQR, 38-53 mg/dL [0.98-1.37 mmol/L]).
Concomitant medications included statins in 79.2% of pa-
tients, antihypertensive medications in 92.0%, and glucose-
lowering agents in 75.1%.

shows the Kaplan-Meier plot of time to first MACE for the 50%
interim analysis.
Table 3 shows results of the sensitivity analysis based on
the final end-of-study assessment for the primary and sec-
ondary cardiovascular outcomes in the ITT population. The
primary outcome measure, time to first MACE, occurred in 124
patients (2.8%) in the placebo treatment group and 119 pa-
tients (2.7%) in the naltrexone-bupropion group (HR, 0.95;
99.7% CI, 0.65-1.38). The components of the primary compos-
ite outcome showed cardiovascular death in 42 placebo-
treated patients (0.9%) and 26 naltrexone-bupropion–
treatedpatients(0.6%;HR,0.61;99.7%CI,0.30-1.27).Nonfatal
stroke occurred in 21 patients (0.5%) in the placebo group and
28 (0.6%) in the naltrexone-bupropion group (HR, 1.32; 99.7%
CI, 0.57-3.08). Nonfatal myocardial infarction occurred in 67
patients (1.5%) in the placebo group and 68 (1.5%) in the nal-
trexone-bupropion group (HR, 1.01; 99.7% CI, 0.61-1.66).
Figure 2B shows the Kaplan-Meier plot of time to first MACE
for the final end-of-study analysis.
Table 4 shows the results from the 25% interim analysis
used in the regulatory approval of naltrexone-bupropion and
subsequently released by the original sponsor (Orexigen) in a
patent filing. The primary outcome, time to first MACE, oc-
curred in 59 patients (1.3%) in the placebo group and 35 pa-
tients(0.8%)inthenaltrexone-bupropiongroup(HR,0.59;95%
CI, 0.39-0.90). Table 4 also shows events rates and HRs with
95% confidence intervals for components of the primary out-
come and secondary outcomes for the 25% interim analysis.
The 25% interim analysis shows 95% confidence intervals
rather than 99.7% confidence intervals because this analysis
tested only whether the trial ruled out a noninferiority mar-
gin of 2.0 and did not test for the margin of 1.4. Table 4 also
shows the primary end point and its components for the on-
treatment analysis. For the on-treatment analyses, the HRs are
less favorable than the ITT analyses and show wider confi-
dence intervals.
Secondary Outcomes
Table 2 shows the secondary outcome measures for the ITT
populationatthe50%interimanalysis.ThecompositeofMACE

tion (64% of planned events) were less favorable than ob-
served at the 50% interim analysis (HR, 0.95; 99.7% CI, 0.95-
1.38). The 25% interim analysis showed more favorable HRs
than subsequent analyses, with very wide confidence inter-
vals due to the low number of events. Table 2, Table 3, and

end points at the 50% interim and final end-of-study analy-
sis. At the 50% interim analysis, all-cause mortality occurred
in 51 placebo patients (1.1%) and 43 naltrexone-bupropion
patients (1.0%; HR, 0.84; 99.7% CI, 0.46-1.54). Hospitaliza-
tion for unstable angina occurred in 43 (1.0%) of placebo-
treated patients and 47 (1.1%) of naltrexone-bupropion–
treated patients (HR, 1.09; 99.7% CI, 0.59-2.02). Coronary
revascularization occurred in 145 (3.3%) of placebo patients
and 132 (3.0%) of naltrexone-bupropion patients (HR, 0.91;
99.7% CI, 0.64-1.29).
Table 2 and Table 3 also include the post hoc composite
outcome of all-cause mortality, nonfatal myocardial infarc-
tion, and nonfatal stroke, which showed less favorable HRs
than the primary outcome because the fewer cardiovascular
deaths were counterbalanced by an excess of noncardiovas-
cular mortality. The broadest measure of cardiovascular out-
come, MACE plus hospitalization for unstable angina or coro-
naryrevascularization,occurredin205placebopatients(4.6%)
and 188 naltrexone-bupropion patients (4.2%; HR, 0.91; 99.7%
CI, 0.68-1.23). Table 2, Table 3, and Table 4 also show the pri-
mary end point and components of the primary end point for
the on-treatment analysis. Because of the low adherence rates,
these analyses have fewer patient-years of follow-up, result-
ing in wider confidence intervals, and consistently show less
favorable HRs than the ITT population.
Adherence and Retention
Figure 3 shows time to permanent study drug discontinua-
tion for any reason. Adherence to study drug, as expected,
was relatively low and showed a different pattern between
the 2 treatment groups. After the first 2 weeks of treatment,
95.1% of patients treated with naltrexone-bupropion and
(97.6%) of placebo patients were taking study medication. At
16 weeks, 72.1% of placebo-treated patients and 64.0% of
naltrexone-bupropion–treated patients were still taking
study drug (P < .001). One year after randomization, 26.3% of
placebo patients and 37.5% of naltrexone-bupropion patients
were still taking study drug (P < .001). Two years after ran-
domization, only 17.3% of placebo patients and 27.0% of
naltrexone-bupropion patients were still taking study drug
(P < .001). The median duration of treatment was 16.3 weeks
for placebo (IQR, 15.6-53.1 weeks) and 18.4 weeks for
naltrexone-bupropion (IQR, 8.1-109.3 weeks).
A large decrease in the number of patients receiving study
drug occurred after the 16-week assessment, with 44% of pla-
cebo patients and 17.8% of naltrexone-bupropion patients dis-
continued by investigators. Most discontinuations were due
to a failure to lose 2% of body weight, but 230 placebo pa-
tients and 154 naltrexone-bupropion patients discontinued
treatmentbecauseofagreaterthan10–mmHgincreaseinblood

tinued treatment remained in follow-up for MACE and con-
tributed to the ITT analysis. Discontinuation of follow-up oc-
curred in 9.7% of placebo patients and 9.2% of naltrexone-
bupropion patients. The median duration of follow-up was
121 weeks (IQR, 114-128 weeks) for placebo and 121 weeks
(IQR, 114-128 weeks) for naltrexone-bupropion.
Other Outcome Measures
At trial completion, body weight decreased a mean of 3.9 kg
(95% CI, −4.1 to −3.7 kg) in the naltrexone-bupropion group
and 1.2 kg (95% CI, −1.3 to −1.0 kg) in the placebo group, cor-
responding to reductions of 3.6% and 1.1%, respectively
(P < .001). The between-group mean difference was 2.7 kg
(95% CI, −2.9 to −2.5 kg; P < .001), representing a 2.5% reduc-
tion (95% CI, −2.8% to −2.3%) in body weight. At trial
completion, waist circumference decreased 2.1 cm (95% CI,
−2.4 to −1.8 cm) in the naltrexone-bupropion group and
0.8 cm (95% CI, −1.0 to −0.5 cm) in the placebo group
(P < .001). In post hoc analysis of data at 16 weeks, time-
weighted systolic blood pressure increased a mean of
1.4 mm Hg (95% CI, 1.0-1.7 mm Hg) in the naltrexone-
bupropion group and 0.5 mm Hg (95% CI, 0.4-0.6 mm Hg) in
the placebo group (P < .001). Time-weighted average heart
rate increased 0.7/min (95% CI, 0.5/min to 0.9/min) in the
naltrexone-bupropion group and 0.6/min (95% CI, 0.3/min to
0.8/min) in the placebo group. The increase in blood pressure
and heart rate at approximately 16 weeks, when adherence to
treatment was still relatively high, showed a mean difference
in blood pressure between treatment groups of 0.46 mm Hg
(95% CI, 0.01-0.92 mm Hg) and a mean difference in heart
rate of 0.45/min (95% CI, 0.11/min to 0.78/min). Plots of
change over time in body weight, systolic blood pressure,
and heart rate are shown in Figure 4, and Figure 5.

Adverse Events
The most common adverse events leading to the discontinu-
ation of study drug are shown in Table 5. These included gas-
trointestinal adverse effects, which occurred in 14.2% of
naltrexone-bupropion–treated patients and 1.9% of placebo-
treated participants (P < .001), and central nervous system
symptoms, which occurred in 5.1% of naltrexone-bupropion
patients and 1.2% of placebo patients (P < .001). Psychiatric
symptoms resulted in study drug discontinuation in 3.1% of
naltrexone-bupropion patients and 0.9% of placebo patients
(P < .001).
Discussion
The cardiovascular safety of obesity drugs has received con-
siderableattentionafterthewithdrawalofsibutramineandfen-
fluramine by the FDA for cardiovascular harm.4,5 Some drugs
that reduce appetite are sympathomimetic agents that can in-
crease blood pressure and heart rate. Bupropion, a drug widely
used to treat depression, has anorexigenic properties result-
ing in modest weight loss.14 The effectiveness of bupropion
is increased when combined with the opioid antagonist
naltrexone.15 A combination product was considered by the

Our study was designed to provide an assessment of car-
diovascular outcomes for extended-release naltrexone,
32 mg/d, and bupropion, 360 mg/d. However, the study was
terminated prematurely after the unplanned release of an
interim analysis after 25% of planned events with MACE oc-
curringin59placebo-treatedpatients(1.3%)and35naltrexone-
bupropion–treated patients (0.8%; HR, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.39-
0.90). After 50% of planned events, outcomes were less
favorable, with MACE occurring in 102 patients (2.3%) in the
placebo group and 90 patients (2.0%) in the naltrexone-
bupropion group (HR, 0.88; adjusted 99.7% CI, 0.57-1.34).
Given the unplanned early termination of the trial, which di-
rectly resulted from the inappropriate release of the highly fa-
vorable 25% interim data, these findings do not establish non-
inferiority for the prespecified margin of 1.4.
Recently, the FDA has adopted a 2-stage approach to drug
approval with the intent of ruling out a high degree of hazard
prior to approval based on an interim analysis of preliminary
clinical trial results. These trials then continue to potentially
rule out a more stringent noninferiority margin in the postap-
provalsetting.16Theapproachofa2-stagesafetytrialwasorigi-
nally developed to facilitate safety assessment of diabetes
drugs.16 For naltrexone-bupropion, the FDA required that the
sponsorconductanoninferioritycardiovascularoutcomestrial,
specifying that an interim analysis would need to rule out a
noninferiority margin of 2.0 prior to approval and a margin of
1.4 at study completion (potentially postapproval).

The success of the 2-stage approach to drug develop-
ment relies on the maintenance of strict confidentiality dur-
ing the time from submission of the initial interim results un-
til completion of the definitive safety study. In practice, a
defined team from the trial sponsor is provided with the in-
terim results and submits the drug for approval but has no on-
goinginvolvementwiththestudy.Thecompanybusinesslead-
ership, the study’
s academic leadership, and all other study
personnel remain blinded until the definitive study is com-
pleted. The FDA also agreed to maintain confidentiality for the
25% interim data until the trial was completed.
During our trial, publication of a patent submitted by
Orexigen, along with a subsequent submission by the com-
pany to the Securities and Exchange Commission,9 resulted
in public release of the 25% interim results of the trial. The
published patent claimed a method of reducing cardiovascu-
lar risk based on a 41% reduction in cardiovascular risk with
naltrexone-bupropion, which were interpreted in the media
as showing cardiovascular benefit. The study academic lead-
ership subsequently recommended and the sponsors agreed
to terminate the trial.
As a result of these events, interpretation of the results of
the trial involves complex statistical issues. Noninferiority
testing to rule out a doubling of cardiovascular risk (an upper
95% confidence limit of the HR not exceeding 2.0) was suc-
cessfully completed after accrual of 94 (25%) of the planned
378 events (Table 4). Accordingly, it is possible to conclude
that naltrexone-bupropion does not double cardiovascular
risk based on the preplanned 25% interim analysis, but it is
not possible to draw any conclusions related to the noninferi-
ority margin of 1.4. A new cardiovascular outcome trial will
be required to address the regulatory mandate to rule out
a noninferiority margin of 1.4 but will not be available for a
minimum of 3 to 4 years.
Per the study design, the data monitoring committee
could consider stopping the trial for overwhelming evidence
of efficacy or harm based on interim analyses at 50% and
75% of trial completion with statistical adjustments using
O’
Brien-Fleming boundaries. The study design did not allow
early termination for demonstration of noninferiority. The
primary outcome data reported in this manuscript were
determined using the 50% interim analysis (192 events), the
last preplanned analysis performed prior to termination of
the trial. The HRs along with the 99.7% confidence intervals
reflect the appropriate statistical adjustments for the 50%
interim analysis. No P values for either superiority or nonin-
feriority are reported because the results of the prematurely
terminated trial cannot be used to rigorously address either
superiority or the prespecified noninferiority margin of 1.4.
An additional sensitivity analysis was performed using the
final data available at the time of last patient contact and
showed less favorable findings than the primary analysis.
The final data include 243 primary composite end points,
approximately 64% of the intended 378 events.
In clinical trials, an ITT analysis is preferred because it is
the only analysis that preserves the integrity of randomiza-
tion and represents a conservative approach to assessment of
efficacy. However, in a safety study, particularly one with a low
adherence rate, the on-treatment analysis can provide addi-
tionalinsightbecauseitreflectsoutcomesinpatientswhilethey
were actually taking the medication under study. In a safety
study, when adherence rates are low, the ITT analysis can re-
sult in a false-positive declaration of noninferiority. Accord-
ingly, an on-treatment analysis is essential to confirm find-
ings derived from the ITT analysis.
In our trial, the on-treatment analysis shows HRs that are
less favorable (higher) than the ITT analysis for naltrexone-
bupropion. This finding is particularly evident for the 25%

interim analysis showing 24 more primary events for the pla-
cebo vs naltrexone-bupropion treatment group in the ITT
analysis (59 vs 35) but only 7 excess events in the placebo
group for the on-treatment analysis (30 vs 23) (Table 4).
The most favorable component of the primary end point at
the 25% interim analysis, cardiovascular death, 19 events
for placebo vs 5 for naltrexone-bupropion, was driven
almost exclusively by a 12-to-1 imbalance in death favoring
naltrexone-bupropion among patients who were no longer
taking study drug. These observations suggest that any infer-
ence regarding noninferiority must be viewed cautiously
pending completion of an adequately powered new clinical
trial, preferably with greater adherence to treatment.
The trial offers some useful findings with respect to the
effectiveness of naltrexone-bupropion as a treatment for obe-
sity and provides insights about the conduct of future trials of
obesity treatments. For the ITT population, at trial comple-
tion, the observed weight loss with naltrexone-bupropion
was modest, with a mean reduction of 3.9 kg (95% CI, −4.1 to
−3.7 kg), 3.6% of initial body weight, compared with 1.2 kg
(95% CI, −1.3 to −1.0 kg) in the placebo group (Figure 4). Com-
pared with placebo, the incremental weight loss was approxi-
mately 2.7 kg (95% CI, −2.9 to −2.5 kg), or 2.5% of body weight.
The modest weight loss efficacy was likely related to low ad-
herence to treatment, with approximately 63% of naltrexone-
bupropion patients and 74% of placebo patients no longer
taking study drug after 12 months.
A relatively low adherence rate was anticipated in the
design of the trial. Patients were discontinued from treat-
ment at 16 weeks (but remained in the ITT population) if they
lost less than 2% of initial body weight, an approach selected
by the FDA, sponsor, and academic leadership to reflect the
use of antiobesity agents in clinical practice. Patients and
physicians do not persist with an obesity treatment in the
absence of weight loss. Patients with obesity are often dispir-
ited and easily frustrated by their inability to lose weight per-
manently after years of trying.17,18 These experiences may
contribute to suboptimal adherence to treatment recommen-
dations and poor study retention. Despite maximal efforts,
poor adherence and modest retention represent challenges to
the conduct of such trials. Because cardiovascular outcomes
trials typically require many patient-years of exposure, suc-
cessfully completing such trials will require intensive efforts
to promote adherence to study drugs and retention of
patients in the trial. The low adherence rate and early termi-
nation of our trial does not allow any reliable conclusions
about the long-term safety of naltrexone-bupropion.
Because blood pressure and heart rate increases repre-
sented the major reasons for concern about the cardiovascu-
lar safety of naltrexone-bupropion, we collected these vital
sign measurements throughout the trial. Post hoc analysis of
blood pressure and heart rate after 16 weeks of treatment,
when adherence was still relatively high, showed a mean
increase in blood pressure for naltrexone-bupropion com-
pared with placebo averaging only 0.46 mm Hg (95% CI,
0.01-0.92 mm Hg) and mean increase in heart rate of
0.45/min (95% CI, 0.11/min to 0.78/min). These changes
are similar to those observed during previous studies of
naltrexone-bupropion. Adverse effects leading to study drug
discontinuation were relatively common, occurring in 28.1%
of naltrexone-bupropion–treated patients and 8.7% of
placebo-treated patients (P < .001). The most common
adverse effects were gastrointestinal and central nervous sys-
tem symptoms (Table 4).
The events leading to the termination of the study serve
as a valuable reminder of the importance of maintaining con-
fidentiality during ongoing trials. Premature release of
interim data can result in inappropriate prejudgment about
the benefits or risks of the studied therapy and make comple-
tion of the trial highly problematic. An FDA guidance for
industry explicitly states that interim data from an ongoing
clinical trial should remain confidential and warns that “such
knowledge can bias the outcome of the study by inappropri-
ately influencing its continuing conduct or the plan of
analyses.”19 Prior to public release of the 25% interim data,
the FDA had already appropriately concluded that the knowl-
edge of the results by business interests within the sponsor
constituted an unacceptable breach of confidentiality that
precluded use of the trial to meet the postapproval regulatory
requirement.11
The findings of this study illustrate the importance of con-
fidentiality for early interim data. In this case, the 25% in-
terim data (Table 4) showed a point estimate for the HR for the
primary end point of 0.59, although with wide confidence in-
tervals (95% CI, 0.39-0.90). However, after an additional 25%
of data were collected, the HR increased to 0.88 (99.7% CI,
0.58-1.34). For the final end-of-study analysis, the HR in-
creased further to 0.95 (99.7% CI, 0.65-1.38), such that any po-
tential benefit suggested in the earlier analysis was no longer
apparent.
Our study has both strengths and weaknesses. It repre-
sents one of the few cardiovascular outcomes trials of phar-
macological agents used to treat obesity and, despite early ter-
mination, collected data on a large number of cardiovascular
events. The unplanned early termination represents an im-
portant weakness that prevented the trial from achieving its
full potential. The poor adherence rate was also a weakness
but may represent the typical pattern observed with antiobe-
sity pharmacological therapies in clinical practice. The obser-
vationsderivedfromthisstudyprovideusefulinsightsforother
investigators designing future outcomes trials for other obe-
sity treatments.
Conclusions
Among overweight or obese patients at increased cardiovas-
cular risk, based on the interim analyses performed after 25%
and 50% of planned events, the upper limit of the 95% confi-
dence interval of the HR for MACE for naltrexone-bupropion
treatment, compared with placebo, did not exceed 2.0. How-
ever,becauseoftheunanticipatedearlyterminationofthetrial,
it is not possible to assess noninferiority for the prespecified
upper limit of 1.4. Accordingly, the cardiovascular safety of this
treatment remains uncertain and will require evaluation in a
new adequately powered outcome trial.
