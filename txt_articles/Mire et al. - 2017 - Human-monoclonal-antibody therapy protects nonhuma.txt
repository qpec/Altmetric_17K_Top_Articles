 There are no approved treatments for Lassa fever, which is endemic to the same regions of West 
Africa that were recently devastated by Ebola. Here we show that a combination of human 
monoclonal antibodies that cross-react with the glycoproteins of all four clades of Lassa virus is 
able to rescue 100% of cynomolgus macaques when treatment is initiated at advanced stages of 
disease, including up to 8 d after challenge.
Lassa virus (LASV) infects more than 300,000 individuals per year across West Africa, 
causing over 3,000 deaths1. The case-fatality rate (CFR) for the hemorrhagic fever Lassa 
fever (LF) has historically ranged from 15% to 50% in hospitalized patients, and a recent 
multi-year study in Sierra Leone reported a 69% CFR in admitted patients2. Currently, a 
large outbreak of LF that began in August of 2015 is devastating Nigeria. Between 
December 2016 and June 2017, the World Health Organization reported a total of 501 
suspected cases (175 laboratory confirmed) and 59 deaths among all cases, with a CFR of 
33.7%3. Previous and recent importation of LF into Europe and the US by travelers on 
commercial airlines4,5 illustrates the potential for spread outside the endemic area. 
Moreover, LASV is also classified by several US government agencies as a ‘Category A’ 
priority pathogen because of a concern about deliberate misuse of the virus.
So far, no preventive vaccines or therapeutics for LF have been approved for human use, and 
only a few candidate vaccines and treatments, such as ribavirin, have been assessed in 
preclinical studies for their potential to protect against against wild-type LASV in nonhuman 
primates (NHPs)6–10. Intravenous ribavirin has been shown to reduce the mortality from 
55% to 5% in individuals at high risk for the disease who present with elevated liver 
enzymes upon hospital admission, provided that the treatment is administered during the 
first 6 d of illness11. There are also a few reports of convalescent plasma being administered 
to individuals with LASV infection12–14, and in one of these cases, a beneficial effect was 
observed when the plasma was administered early in the disease course14. Notably, it was 
shown that immune plasma protected cynomolgus monkeys if given shortly after LASV 
exposure and if the plasma contained neutralizing antibodies that were closely matched to 
the challenge strain of LASV10. These neutralizing antibodies were found to bind the LASV 
glycoprotein (GP), which is composed of the GP subunits GP1 and GP2, and either (i) 
prevent the binding of the GP1 subunit to the receptor α-dystroglycan15; (ii) prevent fusion 
of the viral envelope with the host-cell membrane through GP2-subunit binding; or (iii) 
perform a combination of both. These NHP data suggested that antibodies targeting the GP 
of LASV might be of clinical benefit for individuals with LF, and that they thus warranted 
further preclinical study of antibody efficacy against LASV.
Here we used the cynomolgus macaque model of lethal LASV to assess the protective 
efficacy of five promising LASV-GP-neutralizing huMAbs (37.2D, 12.1F, 8.9F, 19.7E, and 
37.7H) on the basis of cross-reactivity to the four clades (I–IV) of LASV GP, neutralization 
from in vitro assays16, and protective efficacy in guinea pigs17. Macaques were inoculated 
on day 0 with a target dose of 3,500 plaque-forming units (PFU), and these huMAbs were 
administered as a monotherapy referred to as a single-antibody treatment (STx) cohort (Fig. 
1a); treatment was initiated at day 0 after LASV exposure, with additional treatments 
administered during the course of infection for all STx cohorts (19.7E, at day 0 and 5

 postinfection (p.i.) (n = 4); 37.2D, day 0, 4, and 8 p.i. (n = 6); 12.1F, day 0, 4, and 8 p.i. (n = 
3); 37.7H, day 0, 4, and 8 p.i. (n = 3); or 8.9F, day 0, 4, and 8 p.i. (n = 4)). Untreated control 
animals (n = 7) had a mean time to death of 12 d p.i. (Fig. 1a; Supplementary Table 1, 
bracket denotes which experiment each control is from); clinical signs consistent with LF 
(Supplementary Table 1); and viremia, as measured by infectious LASV (Fig. 1b) and RT–
qPCR (Supplementary Fig. 1a) as early as days 4 and 3 p.i., respectively. Each huMab was 
well tolerated, and all STx-huMAb treatment regimens resulted in both 100% protection 
from LF and in survival to study endpoint (Fig. 1a; P < 0.0001; Supplementary Table 2). 
One exception occurred in the STx cohort (Supplementary Table 2, STx-1–4) that received 
huMab 19.7E on days 0 and 5 after LASV exposure (Fig. 1a, P < 0.0078), in which one of 
four in the cohort, animal STx-1, had detectable infectious virus (Fig. 1c) and viral RNA 
(Supplementary Fig. 1b) on days 5, 10, and 15 p.i. and experienced clinical signs of illness 
consistent with LF, requiring euthanasia (Supplementary Table 2). Animals STx-2–4 also 
had detectable viral RNA (Supplementary Fig. 1b), but none of the three had marked clinical 
pathology except for fever, which was detected in STx-4. Additionally, animal STx-17 in the 
8.9F-treatment cohort (Supplementary Table 2, STx17–20) had detectable circulating 
infectious virus (Fig. 1d) and viral RNA (Supplementary Fig. 1c) on days 8, 11, 15, 21, and 
28 p.i. (Fig. 1d); STx-20 from the 8.9F group and STx-13 from the 12.1F group (STx 11–13) 
had detectable viral RNA on day 8 p.i., with STx-20 and STx-13 clearing any detectable 
viral genomes by day 11 p.i. (Supplementary Fig. 1c).
We postulated that the circulating infectious viremia detected in animal STx-17 from the 
8.9F-treatment cohort was due to an 8.9F escape mutant, and we analyzed the sequence of 
the virus at day 21 p.i. Indeed, we isolated an 8.9F escape mutant (LASV 8.9F(e)) from day 
21 p.i. STx-17 serum that encoded a single amino acid mutation, Y150D, in the GP1 subunit 
(the only change found in the complete virus genome). The binding of 8.9F to a glycoprotein 
complex (GPC) Y150D mutant expressed on the surface of HEK-293T/17 cells was 
abrogated, whereas binding by MAbs 37.2D and 12.1F was not reduced (Supplementary 
Table 3). 8.9F binding is conformation dependent, requiring both the GP1 and GP2 subunits, 
suggesting that this mutation affects the quaternary epitope required for 8.9F binding15,16. 
Whereas LASV 8.9F(e) escaped 8.9F neutralization, this virus was completely neutralized in 
vitro by a cocktail (CTx) of 8.9F, 12.1F, and 37.2D (Supplementary Fig. 2). Although LASV 
mutants that develop resistance to a single antibody can be selected, we have yet to observe 
the emergence of resistant mutants in vitro and in vitro to these three antibodies in 
combination (data not shown), which suggests that a combination approach might have 
utility as a therapeutic modality.
To assess therapeutic combinations of these huMAbs, macaques were inoculated on day 0 
with a target dose of 3,500 PFU, and these huMAbs were administered as a cocktail therapy 
referred to as CTx. Treatment was initiated at day 0 (19.7E + 37.2D; n = 4) and at days 3, 6, 
or 8 (8.9F + 12.1F + 37.2D; n = 4, 4, and 5, respectively) post LASV exposure (Fig. 2a; 
Supplementary Table 4). Untreated control animals (n = 6) had a mean time to death of 12 d 
p.i. (Fig. 2a; Supplementary Table 1, bracket denotes which experiment each control is 
from); clinical signs consistent with LF (Supplementary Table 1); and viremia, as measured 
by infectious LASV (Fig. 2b) and RT–qPCR (Supplementary Fig. 3a) as early as days 4 and 
3 p.i., respectively. Each CTx treatment was well tolerated and resulted in 100% protection

 from LF and survival to study endpoint (Fig. 2a, P < 0.0001; Supplementary Table 4). Of 
particular interest was the combination of the three neutralizing huMabs 8.9F, 12.1F, and 
37.2D, which, unlike the 19.7E + 37.7H combination, react to distinct epitopes on the 
LASV-GP complex and bind the GP from four separate clades of LASV (clades I–IV), 
exhibiting the desirable potential for a cross-protective therapeutic for LASV in West 
Africa16. We used the 8.9F/12.1F/37.2D cocktail to assess the therapeutic efficacy in 
animals when treatment was initiated at an advanced stage of infection (Fig. 2a, days 6 and 8 
p.i.), at which point animals were clinically ill (Supplementary Table 4, CTx-9–17) and had 
viremia (Fig. 2c, Supplementary Figs. 3b and 4). Animals from all three delayed CTx 
cohorts with treatment initiated at day 3 (+3), day 6 (+6), or day 8 (+8) after LASV 
challenge were viremic, as assessed by detectable circulating LASV genomes, on the first 
day of treatment (Supplementary Figs. 3b and 4). Notably, all animals in the +6 and +8 
cohorts had detectable circulating infectious LASV on the initial day of treatment. Viremia 
resolved by day 9 or day 11 p.i., respectively, in these two cohorts, with a re-emergence of 
detectable infectious LASV in animal CTx-9 on day 12 (final treatment day) that resolved 
by day 14 p.i. (Fig. 2c). Additionally, major clinical signs and illness were resolved for all 
three delayed-treatment cohorts (Supplementary Table 4).
To assess the humoral immune response to LASV infection in the CTx cohorts treated with 
8.9F/12.1F/37.2D, the circulating levels of IgG to the LASV nucleoprotein (NP) 
(Supplementary Fig. 5a–d) were measured and compared to those of the control cohort. All 
treated animals had detectable levels of circulating anti-LASV-NP IgG, comparable to those 
observed in control animals. This suggests that the CTx therapy did not interfere with the 
humoral immune response to LASV infection.
At the study endpoint for each animal, tissues were examined by immunohistochemistry 
(IHC) for histopathology consistent with LF and for LASV antigen (Supplementary Figs. 6 
and 7, and Supplementary Table 5). The control cohort after euthanasia had observable 
histopathology of the liver, spleen, and brain, as measured by perimembrane (liver) and 
diffuse cytoplasmic (spleen and brain (endothelial cells)) LASV immunolabeling. The CTx 
+6 and CTx +8 cohorts had no observable lesions beyond mild perivascular cuffing in the 
brain tissue (Supplementary Fig. 6k); no LASV immunolabeling was detected. However, 
LASV RNA was detectable in tissues at the study’s endpoint (Supplementary Table 5), as 
has been observed in other viral hemorrhagic fever treatment and infection-model 
studies18,19. Three of the four animals from the CTx +3 cohort had no observable or scored 
lesions, as assessed by histology (Supplementary Fig. 7 and Supplementary Table 5, H&E), 
and animal CTx-5 had minimal liver lesions and mild perivascular cuffing in the brain. 
Interestingly, only animal CTx-8 from this group had no observable LASV immunolabeling 
(Supplementary Fig. 7 and Supplementary Table 5; IHC); CTx-5, CTx-6, and CTx-7 were 
positive for LASV antigen in the liver, spleen, and brain (Supplementary Table 5, IHC).
We further investigated the viral-RNA and infectious-virus loads from LASV target organs 
of the +3 cohort, because this was the only treatment group that had LASV-antigen-positive 
tissues at the day-31 study endpoint. The control animal from this study, C-9 (day 19), was 
positive for LASV RNA in all tissues tested and had an infectious-virus load of greater than 
6log10 PFU/g in the spleen; animal CTx-6 had a 3log lower infectious virus load in the

 spleen, whereas viral loads in tissues from CTx-5, CTx-7, and CTx-8 were below the limit 
of detection. Interestingly, there was no detectable infectious viremia in any animal from the 
+3 CTx 8.9F/12.1F/37.2D cohort, perhaps as a result of the anti-LASV MAbs still 
circulating, at all time points tested (Fig. 2c and Supplementary Figs. 3 and 4). Taken 
together, these data, in regard to NHP convalescence and virus detection, may not be novel, 
given that infectious LASV has been observed months after convalescence in the urine of 
humans who have recovered from the illness13. It is possible that the timing of the 8.9F/
12.1F/37.2D combination treatment of the +3 cohort led to a cell-associated state for the 
virus that did not lead to detectable release of virus. It is also possible that the viruses had 
started to escape the organ, but not the local tissue environment into the circulation. Viral 
RNA in tissues could be associated with noninfectious virus, or it might be degraded. 
Initiating treatment at day +3 did not cause any marked cytopathology in the LASV-antigen-
positive tissues, and there was no overt clinical pathology observed in this cohort at the 
study endpoint. The presence of LASV RNA in tissues in the +3, +6, and +8 cohorts raises 
the possibility that infectious virus could re-emerge at an extended time after treatment 
termination. It is also possible that infectious LASV may be present in immunologically 
privileged sites, such as the eyes or testes. These possibilities will be tested in future studies.
The current studies present a novel alternative for the treatment of LF infections, using an 
approach that relies on the use of fully human MAbs derived from mature B cells isolated 
from convalescent donors. Early studies that employed convalescent plasma to treat active 
LF infections met with mixed success. These results were likely the result of low titers of 
protective antibodies in donor blood, or specificities that were not well matched against 
circulating LASV strains or variants. The current approach, making use of either single 
injections or cocktails of rationally selected huMAbs, consistently conferred high-level 
protection from lethal LF in NHPs. These data support the advance of the huMAb 8.9F/
12.1F/37.2D combination for further preclinical evaluation as a LF therapeutic.
ONLINE METHODS
Study design
48 healthy adult cynomolgus macaques (Macaca fascicularis) of Chinese origin (3–9 kg) 
were used to conduct seven separate studies. An initial study employed four untreated 
control animals to assess the virulence of the seed stock, with 11 controls used in total 
(Supplementary Table 1, C-1–4). Six successive studies were then performed (including 3–8 
treated animals and 1 or 2 controls per study) where the experimental conditions varied 
(Supplementary Tables 2 and 3). Group sizes were chosen assuming a one-tailed alpha of 
0.05, with sample size of at least three per group, which provided >80% power to detect a 
difference in the proportion of surviving animals between the treatment group (100% 
survival rate) and the control group (0% survival rate), using a Fisher’s exact test. Animals 
were randomized, using Microsoft Excel, into treatment or control groups. A number of 
parameters were monitored during the course of the study, including survival, clinical 
observations, hematology, serum biochemistry, viremia by RT–qPCR and plaque assay, and 
tissue pathology. No samples were excluded from analysis in these studies. The overall 
objective of the study as a whole was to assess protection from LF, with all other

 measurements considered to be secondary objectives. Study endpoints were predetermined 
to occur 28–31 d after virus challenge. Data are presented as the means calculated from 
replicate biological samples, not replicate assays, and error bars represent the s.d. across 
replicates. This study was not blinded.
Animal challenge
All procedures with live LASV were performed under Biosafety Level 4 maximum 
containment conditions at the Galveston National Laboratory, Galveston, TX. All animals 
were inoculated intramuscularly (i.m.) with a target dose of 3,500 PFU of LASV (Josiah 
strain: Genbank HQ688672 or HQ688674) (actual dose of LASV was 2,250(1), 3,250(2), 
3,000(3), 3,625(4), 2,500(5), 4,000(6), and 4,500(7) PFU, from studies 1–7 as indicated, 
respectively). In the first study, four untreated control animals were used to demonstrate the 
virulence of the challenge stock. Studies 2–7 were postexposure-treatment studies in which 
anti-LASV-GP huMAbs were administered to macaques by bolus i.v. infusion. Studies 2–5 
were used to identify the most promising antibodies for preclinical development. In the 
second study, huMAb 19.7E (15 mg/kg) was administered to four macaques shortly after 
LASV challenge (day 0) and again on day 5 (Fig. 1a), and one control animal received no 
treatment. In the third study employing nine macaques, huMAb 37.2D (15 mg/kg) was 
administered to four macaques shortly after LASV challenge (day 0), and again on days 4 
and 8 (Fig. 1a), and an equal mixture of huMAb 19.7E and 37.2D (total dose of 15 mg/kg) 
was administered shortly after LASV challenge (day 0) and again on days 4 and 8 (Fig. 1b), 
whereas one control animal received no treatment. In the fourth study involving ten 
macaques, huMAb 37.2D (6 mg/kg) was administered to two macaques shortly after LASV 
challenge (day 0) and again on days 4 and 8 (Fig. 1a); huMAb 12.1F (15 mg/kg) was 
administered to three animals shortly after LASV challenge (day 0) and again on days 4 and 
8 (Fig. 1a); huMAb 37.7H (15 mg/kg) was administered to three animals shortly after LASV 
challenge (day 0) and again on days 4 and 8 (Fig. 1a); and two control animals received no 
treatment. In a fifth study involving nine animals, huMAb 8.9F (15 mg/kg) was administered 
to four animals shortly after LASV challenge (day 0) and again on days 4 and 8 (Fig. 1a); an 
equal mixture of huMAbs 8.9F, 12.1F, and 37.2D (15 mg/kg per huMAb) was administered 
on days 3, 6, and 9 after LASV challenge to four animals (Fig. 1b); and one control animal 
received no treatment. In a sixth study of five animals, the equal mixture of huMAbs 8.9F, 
12.1F, and 37.2D (15 mg/kg per huMAb) was administered to four LASV-infected macaques 
on days 6, 9, and 12 after virus challenge (Fig. 1b); and one control animal received no 
treatment. In a final study of six animals, the equal mixture of huM-Abs 8.9F, 12.1F, and 
37.2D (15 mg/kg per huMAb) was administered to five LASV-infected macaques on days 8, 
11, and 14 after virus challenge (Fig. 1b); and one control animal received no treatment. 100 
μg aliquots of the monoclonal antibodies used in this study are available to verified 
researchers after execution of a material-transfer agreement with Tulane University and 
Zalgen Labs. All 48 animals were given physical exams, and blood was collected at the time 
of challenge and on days 3, 5, 7, and 10 (study 1); days 0, 3, 5, 7, 10, 15, 22, and 28 (study 
2); 0, 4, 8, 11, 15, 22, and 30 (study 3 and 4); 0, 4, 8, 11, 15, 21, and 28 or 31 (study 5); and 
0, 6, 9, 12, 15, 21, and 28 (study 6); 0, 8, 11, 14, 21, and 30 (study 7). In addition, all 
animals were monitored daily and scored for disease progression using an internal 
arenavirus scoring protocol approved by the UTMB Institutional Animal Care and Use

 Committee (IACUC). All IACUC-approved studies performed at UTMB were in compliance 
with the Animal Welfare Act, PHS Policy and other local and Federal statutes and 
regulations relating to experiments involving animals. UTMB facilities used in this work are 
accredited by the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care 
International and adhere to principles specified in the eighth edition of the Guide for the 
Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, National Research Council. The scoring changes 
measured from baseline included posture and activity level, attitude and behavior, food and 
water intake, weight, respiration, and disease manifestations, such as visible rash, 
hemorrhage, ecchymosis, or flushed skin. A score of ≥9 indicated that an animal met the 
criteria for euthanasia.
Detection of virus load
RNA was isolated from whole blood using the viral RNA mini-kit (Qiagen) using 100 μl of 
blood into 600 μl of viral lysis buffer AVL. For tissues (liver, spleen, and brain), 
approximately 100 mg of each sample was stored in 1 ml of RNAlater (Qiagen) for a 
minimum of 24 h to stabilize RNA, and approximately 100 mg was stored for virus 
isolation. For tissues stored in RNAlater, RNAlater was completely removed and tissues 
were homogenized in 600 μl RLT buffer in a 2-ml cryovial using Qiagen tissue lyser and 
stainless-steel beads. Primers/probe targeting the NP gene (Genbank HQ688672) of LASV 
were used for real-time quantitative PCR (RT–qPCR), with the probe used here being 6-
carboxyfluorescein (6FAM)-5′ CCC TCA CTG TGC ACT AAT GGA CTG C3′-6 
carboxytetramethylrhodamine (TAMRA) (Life Technologies). LASV RNA was detected 
using the CFX96 detection system (BioRad Laboratories) in one-step probe RT–qPCR kits 
(Qiagen) with the following cycle conditions: 50 °C for 10 min, 95 °C for 10 s, and 40 
cycles of 95 °C for 10 s and 59 °C for 30 s. Threshold cycle (CT) values representing LASV 
S genomes were analyzed with CFX Manager Software, and data are shown as genome 
equivalents (GEq) (Fig. 2a,c,e). To create the GEq standard, RNA from LASV stocks was 
extracted, and the number of LASV S genomes was calculated using Avogadro’s number, 
the molecular weight of the LASV genome, and the percentage of the S genome segment to 
total viral RNA genomes present in the standard sample. Limit of detection was 1 × 104 
GEq/ml.
Virus titration was performed by plaque assay with Vero 76 cells from all serum samples and 
10% weight/volume tissue homogenates (from tissue frozen at −80 °C), as previously 
described8. Briefly, increasing ten-fold dilutions of the samples were adsorbed to Vero 76 
monolayers in duplicate wells (200 μl); the limit of detection from serum was 15 PFU/ml, 
and the limit of detection from 10% tissue homogenates was 50 PFU/g. All cells were 
verified as mycoplasma free using eMyco-plus mycoplasma detection kit from Boca 
Scientific.
huMAb-neutralization analysis
Briefly, Vero 76 cells were seeded into six-well plates to generate a confluent monolayer on 
the day of inoculation. Neutralization assays were performed with 100 μg or 50 μg of the 
huMAbs 8.9F, 12.1F, 37.2D, or equal parts of all three in a cocktail prepared in DMEM with 
10% guinea-pig complement and incubated with ~100 PFU of LASV or LASV 8.9F(e) in a

 total volume of 200 μl at 37 °C for 60 min; controls with no mAb were included. Medium 
was removed from cells, the huMAbs–virus mixture was added to duplicate wells, and plates 
were incubated for 60 min at 37 °C. The mixture was removed from the cells and 2 ml of 
0.9% agarose in EMEM with 5% FBS were overlaid onto each of the wells. Cells were 
observed 2–4 d postinoculation, and plaques were visualized and counted using neutral red

The specific binding of each huMAb component was assayed on cell lines engineered to 
express LASV GPC transiently. The complete open reading frame (ORF) of the LASV 
glycoprotein was cloned in the pcDNA3.1 + intA vector, verified by Sanger DNA 
sequencing, and transfected in HEK-293T/17 cells at ~70% confluency in poly-D-lysine-
coated six-well polystyrene cell-culture plates. Transfection was performed with 
polyethylenimine (PEI)-based reagent. 24 h post-transfection, cells were washed once with 
1× PBS, pH 7.4 and incubated with fresh 1× PBS, pH 7.4, until cells detached. Cells were 
gently lifted with a cell-culture scrapper and gently resuspended by pipetting to generate a 
dispersed cell suspension. Cells were pelleted by low-speed centrifugation (200g) and 
resuspended in FACS buffer (1× PBS, pH 7.4/2% fetal bovine serum (FBS)/0.05% sodium 
azide). LASV-GPC-expressing or mock-transfected cell lines were incubated for 20 min on 
ice in FACS buffer containing each LASV huMAb or an isotype control antibody. Following 
washing steps, the cells were incubated with a goat anti-human IgG (H + L)-
AlexaFluor-488-labeled secondary antibody diluted in FACS buffer, on ice, for 20 min. Cells 
were then washed and resuspended in FACS buffer containing 1 mg/ml propidium iodide, a 
viability dye that permits the discrimination of live and dead cells. Cells were analyzed by 
FACS using an Accuri C6 Flow Cytometer.
Deep-sequence analysis of RNA genome of LASV 8.9F-MAb escape mutant
To analyze the potential for a virus escape mutant, virus was isolated (1× passage on Vero 
E6) from the 21-d postchallenge sample isolated from animal STx-17. Briefly, viral RNA 
was isolated from a Trizol LS (Invitrogen)/sample mixture using a Direct-zol RNA mini-
prep (Zymo Research), per the manufacturer’s instructions. Approximately 150 ng of 
purified RNA was used to make cDNA using the Ovation RNA-seq 2.0 kit (NuGen), and 
this, in turn, was used for the preparation of the double-stranded DNA library, using Encore 
Ion Torrent library prep kit. Sequencing was performed by the UTMB Molecular Core on 
the Ion Torrent using 318-v2 deep-sequencing chips. Sequence analysis was performed 
using DNA Star Seqman NGen software (DNA Star) on the basis of unpaired analysis of 
125-bp overlaps.
Detection of antibodies against LASV proteins
Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) using recombinant LASV proteins (NP; 
Genbank HQ688672), which were optimized for the detection of virus-specific IgM and IgG 
levels in serum, were coated in strip-well plates, blocked, dried, and packaged with 
desiccating packs (Zalgen Labs; 10004 ReLASVTM Pan-Lassa IgG/IgM ELISA Test Kit)20. 
For analysis, primate sera were diluted 1:100 in a proprietary-sample dilution buffer and 
incubated in wells for 30 min at room temperature, washed, and then incubated with a

 1:2,500 dilution of HRP-labeled anti-monkey IgG (Fitzgerald Industries International, 43R-
IG020HRP) for an additional 30 min. After washing, detection was performed with 
tetramethylbenzidine substrate for 10 min at room temperature, stopped with sulfuric acid, 
and then read at an absorbance of 450 nm using a Molecular Devices ELISA plate reader. 
Reciprocal titers were calculated using mean +3 s.d. cutoffs established with similarly 
diluted baseline serum controls.
Hematology and serum biochemistry
Total white blood cell counts, white blood cell differentials, red blood cell counts, platelet 
counts, hematocrit values, total hemoglobin concentrations, mean cell volumes, mean 
corpuscular volumes, and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentrations were analyzed from 
blood collected in tubes containing EDTA using a laser-based hematologic analyzer 
(Beckman Coulter). Serum samples were tested for concentrations of albumin, amylase, 
alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase 
(ALP), gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT), glucose, calcium, uric acid, total protein, blood 
urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine (CRE), and C-reactive protein (CRP) by using a Piccolo 
point-of-care analyzer and Biochemistry Panel Plus analyzer discs (Abaxis).
Histopathology and immunohistochemistry
Necropsy was performed on all subjects. Tissue samples of all major organs were collected 
for histopathologic and immunohistochemical examination, immersion-fixed in 10% neutral-
buffered formalin, and processed for histopathology, as previously described. For 
immunohistochemistry, specific anti-LASV immunoreactivity was detected using either an 
anti-LASV GP or an anti-LASV Z protein rabbit primary antibody (Integrated 
BioTherapeutics) at a 1:1,000 dilution for the GP antibody and a 1:500 dilution for the anti-
Z antibody. In brief, tissue sections were processed for immunohistochemistry using the 
Dako Autostainer (Dako). Secondary antibody used was biotinylated goat anti-rabbit IgG 
(Vector Laboratories) at 1:200 followed by Dako LSAB2 streptavidin-HRP (Dako). Slides 
were developed with Dako DAB chromagen (Dako) and counterstained with hematoxylin. 
Nonimmune rabbit IgG was used as a negative control.
