BACKGROUND
Texas is one of several states that have barred Planned Parenthood affiliates from pro-
viding health care services with the use of public funds. After the federal government 
refused to allow (and courts blocked) the exclusion of Planned Parenthood affiliates 
from the Texas Medicaid fee-for-service family-planning program, Texas excluded them 
from a state-funded replacement program, effective January 1, 2013. We assessed rates 
of contraceptive-method provision, method continuation through the program, and 
childbirth covered by Medicaid before and after the Planned Parenthood exclusion.
METHODS
We used all program claims from 2011 through 2014 to examine changes in the number 
of claims for contraceptives according to method for 2 years before and 2 years after the 
exclusion. Among women using injectable contraceptives at baseline, we observed rates 
of contraceptive continuation through the program and of childbirth covered by Medic-
aid. We used the difference-in-differences method to compare outcomes in counties 
with Planned Parenthood affiliates with outcomes in those without such affiliates.
RESULTS
After the Planned Parenthood exclusion, there were estimated reductions in the number 
of claims from 1042 to 672 (relative reduction, 35.5%) for long-acting, reversible contra-
ceptives and from 6832 to 4708 (relative reduction, 31.1%) for injectable contraceptives 
(P<0.001 for both comparisons). There was no significant change in the number of 
claims for short-acting hormonal contraceptive methods during this period. Among 
women using injectable contraceptives, the percentage of women who returned for a 
subsequent on-time contraceptive injection decreased from 56.9% among those whose 
subsequent injections were due before the exclusion to 37.7% among those whose sub-
sequent injections were due after the exclusion in the counties with Planned Parenthood 
affiliates but increased from 54.9% to 58.5% in the counties without such affiliates 
(estimated difference in differences in counties with affiliates as compared with those 
without affiliates, −22.9 percentage points; P<0.001). During this period in counties with 
Planned Parenthood affiliates, the rate of childbirth covered by Medicaid increased by 
1.9 percentage points (a relative increase of 27.1% from baseline) within 18 months after 
the claim (P 
= 
0.01).
CONCLUSIONS
The exclusion of Planned Parenthood affiliates from a state-funded replacement for a 
Medicaid fee-for-service program in Texas was associated with adverse changes in the 
provision of contraception. For women using injectable contraceptives, there was a re-
duction in the rate of contraceptive continuation and an increase in the rate of childbirth 
covered by Medicaid. (Funded by the Susan T. Buffett Foundation.)

The new engl and jour nal of medicine
F
ederal public health financing 
through Medicare, Medicaid, and the Af-
fordable Care Act relies on an array of 
public and private entities to deliver health care 
services. Historically, federal statute or rule has 
required that all medically qualified providers be 
eligible to provide care that is funded wholly or 
in part through federal programs. Legislation chal-
lenging this tradition by the exclusion of Planned 
Parenthood affiliates from participation in state-
administered, federally funded family-planning 
programs has been adopted or proposed in 17 
states and both houses of the U.S. Congress.1 
Texas was the first state to enforce such a law.
Beginning in 2007, Texas operated a Medicaid 
waiver program, the Women’s Health Program, 
with 90% of funding from the federal govern-
ment.2 In 2011, the Texas legislature directed the 
program to exclude Planned Parenthood affili-
ates. The federal Centers for Medicare and Med-
icaid Services informed Texas that because the 
exclusion of medically qualified providers vio-
lated federal law, it would not renew the waiver 
but would continue transition funding through 
the end of 2012. Litigation kept Planned Parent-
hood affiliates functioning in the program until 
the transition funding ended. Texas then replaced 
the federally funded program with a nearly iden-
tical 100% state-funded program (the Texas 
Women’s Health Program) that excluded clinics 
affiliated with an abortion provider, effective 
January 1, 2013.3
Effective 15 months earlier (on September 1, 
2011), Texas had cut family-planning grants (a 
separate funding stream) by 66% and redistrib-
uted the remaining grant funding away from 
dedicated family-planning providers, such as, 
but not limited to, Planned Parenthood affili-
ates. The Texas legislature did this by removing 
Title V and Title XX family-planning funding 
and requiring the initiation of a new, tiered 
grant-award process favoring county health de-
partments, community health centers, and other 
comprehensive care providers.4 The 2011 reduc-
tions in grants and redistribution of funds were 
followed by the closure of 82 family-planning 
clinics, about a third of which were affiliated 
with Planned Parenthood.5 This sharp curtail-
ment of the family-planning safety net in Texas 
occurred before the 2013 exclusion of Planned 
Parenthood affiliates from the fee-for-service 
family-planning program.
We used claims data for all clients of the 
Women’s Health Program and its replacement, 
the Texas Women’s Health Program, to assess 
changes in the provision of contraceptives after 
the exclusion of Planned Parenthood affiliates. 
Among women who use injectable contraception 
(depot medroxyprogesterone acetate), we also 
estimated the change in continuation of the 
contraceptive method in the program and in 
the rate of childbirth covered by Medicaid after 
the exclusion.
Methods
Data Sources
Our data included all pharmacy and medical 
claims from January 1, 2011, to December 31, 
2014, under public fee-for-service family-plan-
ning insurance programs in Texas. We also 
accessed all claims for childbirth covered by 
Medicaid using unique identifications for two 
cohorts of women who use injectable contracep-
tives. We retrieved data regarding women’s 
counties of residence from the eligibility and 
billing system. We also used administrative re-
cords from the Texas Department of State Health 
Services and from Planned Parenthood to cate-
gorize counties as either having or not having 
providers affiliated with Planned Parenthood at 
the beginning of the study.
In keeping with the eligibility criteria of the 
programs, all women who were receiving services 
were fertile, legal Texas residents between the 
ages of 18 and 44 years with incomes at or below 
185% of the federal poverty level. Using billing 
records, we identified the women on the basis of 
the presence of a medical claim that included 
one or more of the Current Procedural Terminol-
ogy codes for a valid family-planning service or 
a pharmacy claim that included an appropriate 
national pharmacy code for a contraceptive meth-
od. For each quarter, we categorized contracep-
tive methods into three groups: long-acting re-
versible contraceptives (LARC; contraceptive 
implants and intrauterine devices), an injectable 
contraceptive (depot medroxyprogesterone ace-
tate), and short-acting hormonal methods (oral 
contraceptive pills, transdermal contraceptive 
patches, and contraceptive rings). We then sepa-
rated each set of claims into those that were 
filed in counties that had a Planned Parenthood 
affiliate in 2011 and those that were filed in 
counties without such an affiliate at that time.
Of the 254 counties in Texas, only 23 had

Removal of Planned Parenthood from Texas Health Program
clinics affiliated with Planned Parenthood. We 
first compared the group of counties that had a 
Planned Parenthood–affiliated clinic with those 
that did not with respect to the number of 
women between the ages of 18 and 44 years who 
had household incomes that would qualify them 
for the program (≤185% of the federal poverty 
level), the number of childbirths to legal resi-
dents covered by Medicaid, and the proportion 
of women between the ages of 18 and 44 years 
who did not have health insurance. We obtained 
these indicators from the American Community 
Survey, using 5-year averages centered on 2012, 
and from Texas Medicaid billing records.6
We also assessed the quarterly volume of pro-
gram claims for contraceptives, according to 
method, for counties with Planned Parenthood 
affiliates and those without such affiliates during 
the 16 observed quarters (8 before and 8 after 
the exclusion). Among women using an inject-
able contraceptive in counties with Planned 
Parenthood affiliates and those without such 
affiliates in the fourth quarters of 2011 and 
2012, we also measured the proportion of wom-
en who returned to the program for any service, 
who returned for an on-time subsequent injec-
tion, and who underwent childbirth covered by 
Medicaid during the following 18 months.
Study Oversight
The institutional review board at the University 
of Texas at Austin determined that the study was 
exempt from human-subjects review; therefore, 
no informed consent was required. The authors 
designed the study, and the funder had no role 
in the analysis or interpretation of the data, the 
writing of the manuscript, or the decision to 
submit the manuscript for publication. All the 
authors vouch for the integrity and completeness 
of the data and analyses.
Statistical Analysis
We used the difference-in-differences method 
and regression discontinuity to compare the 
number of claims for each contraceptive method 
in counties with Planned Parenthood affiliates 
and in those without such affiliates before and 
after the exclusion on January 1, 2013. This ap-
proach accounted for the influence of time- 
invariant differences between counties with af-
filiates and those without affiliates and for 
statewide trends over time that could influence 
service provision.7
On the basis of the quarterly number of 
claims for each contraceptive method, we calcu-
lated the difference in provision between coun-
ties with Planned Parenthood affiliates and those 
without such affiliates for each quarter and each 
method. We fitted local linear regression models 
to summarize the differences in volumes for 
each method.8 In these models, we allowed the 
slopes and intercepts to vary before and after the 
exclusion by using an indicator that was equal to 
1 after the exclusion and 0 before the exclusion 
and an interaction between this indicator and 
time. We estimated the discontinuity in the dif-
ferences at the point of the exclusion with the 
indicator for post-exclusion. Finally, we com-
puted the relative change in provision by divid-
ing this discontinuity by the estimated provision 
in counties with Planned Parenthood affiliates 
at the point of exclusion (as estimated by means 
of linear regression).
In order to assess changes in the rates of 
contraceptive continuation and subsequent child-
birth covered by Medicaid associated with the 
exclusion of Planned Parenthood affiliates, we 
focused on women who were using an injectable 
contraceptive. Unlike other forms of contracep-
tion, this method requires regular provider visits 
and has a relatively short span of contraceptive 
effectiveness (3 months). These features of the 
method allowed us to observe changes in the rate 
of childbirth within 18 months after the claim, 
which would not be possible with LARC methods 
(which last longer) or oral contraceptive pills 
(which may be dispensed for a single month or 
up to 12 months per claim).
We included two cohorts in our comparison. 
The first cohort received an injection in the 
fourth quarter of 2011 and thus had a year to 
continue receiving services before the exclusion 
of Planned Parenthood affiliates took effect. The 
second cohort received an injection in the fourth 
quarter of 2012 and thus was subject to the in-
fluence of the exclusion before the due date for 
the next injection. For each cohort and county 
group, we computed the proportions of women 
who received a service covered by the program 
in the following quarter, who received an injec-
tion in that quarter, and who underwent child-
birth covered by Medicaid in the following 18 
months. We calculated the difference in differ-
ences between the two cohorts and groups of 
counties.

women would return to the program during the 
next quarter, would receive an on-time subse-
quent injection, and would undergo childbirth 
covered by Medicaid within 18 months, we used 
generalized linear models for the response fre-
quencies in the respective tables. In each model, 
we used an indicator equal to 1 after the exclu-
sion and 0 before the exclusion, an indicator 
equal to 1 for the group of counties with 
Planned Parenthood affiliates and 0 for those 
without Planned Parenthood affiliates, and an 
interaction between these indicators to provide a 
direct statistical test of the difference in differ-
ences in the probability of each outcome. The 
assumed distribution of the frequencies (either 
binomial or Poisson) did not substantially change 
the significance of the tests. We report P values 
from the Poisson models because they were 
larger and thus more conservative.
Results
Change in Claims for Contraceptives
The 23 counties with Planned Parenthood affili-
ates were home to 60% of female Texas residents 
between the ages of 18 and 44 years who were 
living at or below 185% of the federal poverty 
level (Table 1). The proportions of women who 
had no health insurance were similar in counties 
with Planned Parenthood affiliates and in those 
without such affiliates. Of all the childbirths 
that legal residents underwent and that were 
covered by Medicaid in 2012, a total of 63% oc-
curred in counties with Planned Parenthood af-
filiates. In the period before the exclusion, there 
were 82 closures of family-planning clinics in 
Texas,5 and the decrease in the number of fami-
ly-planning clinics was greater in counties with-
out Planned Parenthood affiliates than in those 
with such affiliates.
Before the exclusion, the numbers of claims 
for LARC methods and injectable contraceptives 
were decreasing in both groups of counties, with 
somewhat sharper decreases in those with 
Planned Parenthood affiliates (Fig. 1A). However, 
the number of claims for short-acting hormonal 
methods was increasing in both groups of coun-
ties during the eight quarters before the ex-
clusion.
In the quarter after the exclusion, there was a 
sharp decrease in the number of claims for 
Figure 1 (facing page). Quarterly Claims for Contra-
ceptives, According to Method, Type of County,  
and Timing before or after the Exclusion of Planned 
Parenthood Affiliates.
Panel A shows the quarterly number of claims for long-
acting reversible contraceptive (LARC) methods, inject-
able agents, and short-acting hormonal methods, ac-
cording to whether the woman’s county of residence 
had Planned Parenthood affiliates before the exclusion 
of such affiliates from the Texas Women’s Health Pro-
grams as of January 1, 2013. Panel B shows the differ-
ence in the number of such claims between the group 
of counties that had a Planned Parenthood affiliate and 
the group that did not during the same period before 
and after the exclusion. Lines that are fitted to local 
linear regression models show the differences in vol-
umes for each method; dashed lines indicate 95% con-
fidence intervals. The change in the difference at the 
point of the exclusion was significant with respect to 
the provision of LARC methods and injectable contra-
ceptives (P<0.001 for both comparisons) but not with 
respect to short-acting hormonal methods (P = 0.22).

next 2 years. In contrast, the provision of short-
acting hormonal methods changed little in the 
two groups of counties in the quarter after the 
exclusion and declined steadily thereafter.
The difference in the number of claims for 
each type of contraceptive in each quarter in 
counties with Planned Parenthood affiliates and 
in those without such affiliates is shown in Fig-
ure 1B. The difference in differences at the point 
of Planned Parenthood exclusion was significant 
for the provision of LARC methods and inject-
able contraceptives (P<0.001 for both compari-
sons) but not for short-acting hormonal methods 
(P 
= 
0.22). The exclusion of Planned Parenthood 
affiliates was associated with estimated reduc-
tions in the number of claims from 1042 to 672 
(relative reduction, 35.5%) for LARC methods and 
from 6832 to 4708 (relative reduction, 31.1%) for 
injectable contraceptives.
Change in Rates of Contraceptive 
Continuation and Childbirth
Table 2 provides a comparison of the rates of 
continuation of contraception and of childbirth 
covered by Medicaid between women who re-
ceived a contraceptive injection in the fourth 
quarter of 2011 and those who received such an 
injection in the fourth quarter of 2012. The pro-
portion of women returning for a subsequent 
on-time contraceptive injection in counties with 
Planned Parenthood affiliates was lower after 
the exclusion. Specifically, the percentage of 
women decreased from 56.9% to 37.7% in coun-
ties with Planned Parenthood affiliates but in-
creased from 54.9% to 58.5% in counties with-
out such affiliates (estimated difference in 
differences for counties with affiliates as com-
pared with those without affiliates, −22.9 per-
centage points; P<0.001). This change represents 
a relative decrease of 40.2% from baseline (−22.9 
percentage points divided by 56.9%).
The exclusion was also associated with an 
increased rate of childbirth covered by Medicaid 
within 18 months after the claim. The percent-
age of women who underwent childbirth covered 
by Medicaid within 18 months increased from 
7.0% to 8.4% in the counties with Planned Par-
enthood affiliates and decreased from 6.4% to 
5.9% in the counties without Planned Parent-
hood affiliates (estimated difference in differ-
ences, 1.9 percentage points; P 
= 
0.01). This 
change represents a relative increase of 27.1% 
from baseline (1.9 percentage points divided by 
7.0%) in the proportion of women using inject-
able contraceptives who underwent childbirth 
covered by Medicaid within 18 months after the 
claim.
Discussion
After Texas abruptly excluded Planned Parent-
hood affiliates from its fee-for-service family-
planning program, the number of claims for 
LARC methods declined, as did the number of 
claims for contraceptive injections. Among 
women using injectable contraceptives, fewer 
women who received an injection in the quarter 
preceding the exclusion continued to receive an 
injection through the program than did those in 
an earlier cohort. In addition, there was a dis-
proportionate increase in the rate of childbirth 
covered by Medicaid. Although data are lacking 
on intendedness of pregnancy, it is likely that 
many of these pregnancies were unintended, 
since the rates of childbirth among these women 
increased in the counties that were affected by 
the exclusion and decreased in the rest of the 
state.
The reduction in the number of claims for 
LARC methods in the counties with Planned 
Parenthood affiliates at the time of the exclusion 
represents a divergence from the trend toward 
an increased number of claims for LARC methods 
in counties with Planned Parenthood affiliates 
in the years preceding the exclusion, a trend that 
has also been observed nationally.9,10 This change 
is worrisome, since increased access to LARC 
methods is a priority of the American College of 
Obstetricians and Gynecologists,11 and one study 
has indicated substantial unmet demand for 
LARC methods in Texas.12 Thus, the introduc-
tion of additional barriers to access to LARC 
methods by the exclusion of skilled, specialized 
family-planning providers was associated with a 
shift toward methods that have lower rates of 
efficacy and continuation13 and, in the case of 
women who used injectable contraceptives in the 
fourth quarter of 2012, an increase in the rate of 
childbirth covered by Medicaid.
Our data are observational and cannot prove 
causality. However, our analyses suggest that the 
exclusion of Planned Parenthood affiliates from 
the Texas Women’s Health Program had an ad-
verse effect on low-income women in Texas by

Removal of Planned Parenthood from Texas Health Program
reducing the provision of highly effective meth-
ods of contraception, interrupting contraceptive 
continuation, and increasing the rate of child-
birth covered by Medicaid. Although our data do 
not capture specific barriers that Planned Par-
enthood clients encountered after the exclusion, 
another study that was based on interviews with 
women using injectable contraceptives that were 
paid for by the Women’s Health Program before 
the exclusion of Planned Parenthood affiliates in 
two Texas cities (Houston and Midland) revealed 
obstacles that these clients faced after the exclu-
sion. Clients who returned to Planned Parent-
hood after the exclusion were required to pay a 
fee of $60 or more for a contraceptive injection.14 
Those who sought a new provider were often 
required to undergo additional examinations or 
office visits or were charged a copayment before 
receiving the injection.
One limitation of our analysis is that the effect 
that we observed was restricted to the 2 years im-
mediately after the exclusion. The slope of the 
local regression lines that were fit to the provi-
sion of contraceptives after the exclusion sug-
gests an attenuation of changes over time, as 
has been observed in other studies of the effects 
of changes in reproductive health policy.15 In ad-
dition, our models have not been adjusted for 
any changes in county-level characteristics that 
may have taken place during the period of obser-
vation. Another limitation is that we have no 
information on contraceptive services that women 
paid for out of pocket or received through other 
subsidized programs. However, since the fee-for-
service family-planning program was the payer 
of first resort and since funding for subsidized 
family planning was severely limited in Texas 
during the study period,5 it is unlikely that 
women were pulled away from the Texas Wom-
en’s Health Program to be served through other 
programs. Also, our analysis includes only child-
births covered by Medicaid in Texas, and data 
for women who gave birth out of state or with 
private insurance coverage are not captured.
Before the Planned Parenthood exclusion, cuts 
in grant funding and the reduced priority given 
to specialized clinics had already substantially 
reduced the amount of funding available to 
Planned Parenthood affiliates and reduced ac-
cess to LARC methods, especially among women 
who did not qualify for the Medicaid waiver 
family-planning program because of their resi-

Effective January 1, 2013, Texas excluded Planned Parenthood affiliates from the state-funded Texas Women’s Health Program. Shown here are data for women who received an injec-
tion in the fourth quarter (Q4) of 2011 and thus had a year to continue receiving services before the exclusion of Planned Parenthood affiliates took effect and those who received an in-
jection in the fourth quarter of 2012 and thus were subject to the influence of the exclusion before the due date for the next injection. NA denotes not applicable.
†  
The absolute difference in differences between groups is for the counties with Planned Parent affiliates as compared with those without such affiliates.
‡  
The relative difference in differences from baseline was calculated by dividing the absolute difference between groups by the percentage of women in the 2011 cohort in whom the listed 
event was reported in counties with Planned Parenthood affiliates.

Removal of Planned Parenthood from Texas Health Program
dency status.5 Thus, it is likely that the changes 
we observed in the fee-for-service family-plan-
ning program after the Planned Parenthood ex-
clusion represent only a portion of the total re-
duction in the availability of services associated 
with the multiple efforts to defund these provid-
ers. Moreover, because the Texas family-plan-
ning safety net includes a diverse mix of Planned 
Parenthood affiliates, private dedicated family-
planning providers, and public entities,4,5 our es-
timates may be conservative if they are applied to 
states in which Planned Parenthood affiliates are 
a more dominant source of family-planning care.
In conclusion, the implementation of the 2013 
exclusion of Planned Parenthood affiliates from 
a Medicaid waiver program in Texas was associ-
ated with adverse changes in the rates of provi-
sion and continuation of contraception and with 
increases in the rate of childbirth covered by 
Medicaid. These findings have implications re-
garding the likely consequences of proposals to 
exclude Planned Parenthood affiliates from pub-
lic funding in other states or at the national level.
