Abstract
This editorial summarises important findings from the PARADIGM-HF study. PARADIGM-HF indicated that the angiotensin receptor-
neprilysin inhibitor, LCZ696, is superior to enalapril in reducing the risks of cardiovascular death and of hospitalisation for heart failure in 
patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction.

LCZ696, an Angiotensin–neprilysin Inhibitor Versus Enalapril in Heart 
Failure – Summary of PARADIGM-HF Results

Since enalapril was shown to reduce the risk of all-cause death in 
the CONSENSUS1 and SOLVD-T trials,2 angiotensin-converting enzyme 
inhibitors (ACEIs) have been the mainstay of treatment for patients 
with heart failure (HF) and a reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). In 
the SOLVD-T trial there was a relative risk reduction (RRR) of 16% 
 
in all-cause death and of 26% in HF hospitalisation among patients 
with mild-to-moderate symptoms with long-term enalapril treatment.2 
Further studies showing additional reductions on mortality and HF 
hospitalisation by the subsequent addition of beta-blockers (BB) and 
mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRA) to ACEIs, established 
triple neurohormonal blockade as the current paradigm of medical 
therapy in HFrEF
.3-6 However, there is an unmet need to further 
 
reduce mortality and morbidity risk; 5-year mortality risk among HF 
patients is >50%.7
The current therapeutic strategy in HFrEF is based on the 
antagonism of the regulatory systems (renin-angiotensin-aldosterone 
system and the sympathetic nervous system among others) that 
 
produce vasoconstriction, sodium and water retention, hypertrophy, 
apoptosis and fibrosis, all of them having a negative impact on 
ventricular remodelling and prognosis in the long term.8 To improve 
further ventricular remodelling and clinical outcomes a complimentary 
strategy would be the stimulation of the counter-regulatory 
 
systems (natriuretic peptides [NPs] system and others) which 
have effects that oppose those of the regulatory systems. LCZ696 
(Entresto™, Novartis AG, Basel, Switzerland) is a drug that antagonises 
the regulatory systems and, in addition, stimulates the counter-
regulatory systems. 
LCZ696 comprises the neprilysin inhibitor, sacubitril (AHU377) and the 
angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB), valsartan.9,10 Neprilysin is a neutral 
endopeptidase that degrades a range of endogenous vasoactive 
peptides,11,12 among them NPs and angiotensin–II. Inhibition of 
neprilysin by sacubitril therefore increases the levels of NPs providing 
beneficial haemodynamic and molecular effects. However, sacubitril, 
when used alone, also increases the levels of angiotensin–II, 
countering the beneficial effects derived from NPs levels increase. 
Therefore, to obtain full benefit from sacubitril an ARB must be added 
to block angiotensin receptor-1 stimulation by the increased levels 
 
of angiotensin-II.13,14
The addition of counter-regulatory systems stimulation to the traditional 
strategy of regulatory systems blockage constitutes a new paradigm 
in HF treatment that was evaluated in the PARADIGM-HF study. The 
hypothesis was tested that LCZ696 would be superior to enalapril in 
reducing cardiovascular mortality and morbidity in patients with HFrEF
. 
When considering the ethical aspects of not using an ACEI in the LCZ696 
arm it is relevant to mention that the latter contains a valsartan moiety 
and that ARBs remain recommended as an alternative to ACEIs in 
patients with HFrEF

PARADIGM-HF 
In the randomised, double-blind, multicentre, international trial 
PARADIGM-HF 
(ClinicalTrials.gov 
number 
NCT01035255), 
8,442 
patients with HF and a left ventricular ejection fraction ≤40%, in New 
York Heart Association (NYHA) class II–IV were randomised to either 
LCZ696 200 mg twice daily or enalapril 10 mg twice daily in addition 
to recommended therapy, including BBs and MRAs.16,17 The boundary 
for an overwhelming benefit of LCZ696 was crossed which meant that, 
according to pre-specified rules, after a median follow up of 27 months, 
the trial was stopped early.18 Primary outcome, which was a composite 
of death from cardiovascular causes or a first hospitalisation for HF, 
occurred in 914 patients (21.8%) in the LCZ696 group compared with 
1117 patients (26.5%) in the enalapril group (95% confidence interval 
[CI], 0.73 to 0.87; p=0.0000002, number needed to treat [NNT]=21) 
(Figure 1A and Table 1).17,19
Both components of the primary composite endpoint were reduced by 
LCZ696 compared with enalapril: time to cardiovascular death (hazard 
ratio = 0.80 [95% CI: 0.71–0.89]; p=0.00004, NNT=32) (Figure 1B and 
Table 1) and time to first HF hospitalisation (hazard ratio = 0.79 [95% CI: 
0.71–0.89]; p=0.00004, NNT=36) (Figure 1C and Table 1).17,19 
LCZ696 was more efficacious than enalapril both in terms of reducing 
sudden cardiac deaths and reducing deaths from worsening HF; this 
accounted for the majority of cardiovascular deaths.20 The LCZ696 
treatment effect for sudden cardiac death was not influenced by the 
presence of defibrillator devices.20 The efficacy of LCZ696 was superior to 
that of enalapril across the spectrum of age of the PARADIGM-HF patients, 
with a favourable benefit–risk profile apparent in all age groups.21 Although 
most PARADIGM-HF patients had mild symptoms, many were at high risk 
for adverse outcomes and obtained a large absolute benefit from LCZ696, 
compared with enalapril.22 In addition, in surviving patients with HF
, 
 
LCZ696 prevented clinical progression more effectively than enalapril.23 
Overall, fewer patients stopped their study medication because of an 
adverse event in the LCZ696 group than in the enalapril group (10.7% 
versus 12.3%; p=0.03).17 No major safety signals emerged for LCZ696 
therapy.18 The LCZ696 group had lower proportions of patients with 
renal impairment, hyperkalaemia and cough than the enalapril group, 
though the proportion of patients with hypotension was higher in the 
LCZ696 group (Table 2). Angioedema occurred very rarely and although 
it was more frequent in the LCZ696 than in the enalapril group, the study 
was not powered to show differences in such rare events (Table 2).

When comparing the results of the SOLVD-T and the CHARM-alternative 
trials with those of the PARADIGM-HF study it may be inferred that LCZ696 
doubles the effect on cardiovascular mortality of renin angiotensin 
aldosterone system inhibitors.2,18,24 Furthermore, an indirect comparison of 
LCZ696 with a putative placebo from SOLVD-T study25 showed that LCZ696 
may induce a RRR of 34% (95% CI: 21–44%; p<0.0001) in cardiovascular 
death, of 28% (95% CI: 16–39%; p<0.0001) in all-cause mortality and of 
49% (95% CI: 39–58%; p<0.0001) in HF hospitalisation compared to 
placebo. These benefits were obtained even though LCZ696 was added to 
comprehensive background beta-blocker and MRA therapy. 
Summary
PARADIGM-HF findings underscore the benefits of LCZ696 treatment 
versus enalapril for patients with HFrEF
, with strong evidence based on: 
a rigorous trial design, large sample size, clinically meaningful endpoint, 
and a powerful beneficial effect with a very small p-value indicating high 
statistical significance. Further, a consistent effect was observed across a 
wide range of studied subgroups and benefits were achieved even though 
LCZ696 was added to comprehensive background BB and MRA therapy. 
Patients in PARADIGM-HF had similar rates of implantable cardioverter-
defibrillator (ICD) device use as in other contemporary trials such as 
EMPHASIS-HF6 and RED-HF26 and more than in SHIFT trial.27
More patients with HFrEF will soon be able to benefit from this new 
treatment. LCZ696 [sacubitril/valsartan tablets] was approved by the 
US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of HFrEF 
in July 2015.28 Further, the agent is approved in the EU as well as in 
Switzerland. In addition, the 2014 Canadian Cardiovascular Society 
Heart Failure Management Guidelines Focus Update recommended 
that in patients with mild to moderate HF
, an EF<40%, an elevated NP 
level or hospitalisation for HF in the past 12 months, a serum potassium 
level below 5.2 mmol/L and an estimated glomerular filtration rate of 
30 mL/min or greater and treated with appropriate doses of guideline-
directed medical therapy should be treated with LCZ696 in place of an 
ACEI or an ARB.29 It will be of interest to discover what approach will be 
adopted in future European and US guidelines. ■
