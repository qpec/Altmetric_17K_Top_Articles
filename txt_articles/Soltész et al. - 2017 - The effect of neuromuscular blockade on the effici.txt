Summary
Facemask ventilation of the lungs can be an important rescue intervention in a ‘cannot intubate’ scenario. We
assessed the effect of neuromuscular blockade on expiratory tidal volumes in patients with expected difficulty in
mask ventilation. The lungs of patients with at least three predictors of difficulty in mask ventilation were ventilated
using a facemask held with two hands, with mechanical ventilation set in a pressure-controlled mode. Tidal volumes
were recorded before and after the establishment of complete neuromuscular block. In 113 patients, median (IQR
[range]) tidal volume increased from 350 (260–492 [80–850]) ml initially, by 48% to 517 (373–667 [100–1250]) ml
30 s after rocuronium administration, (p < 0.001). After the onset of the complete neuromuscular block, a median
tidal volume of 600 (433–750 [250–1303]) ml was observed, corresponding to an increase of 71% from baseline val-
ues (p < 0.001), and 16% from values obtained 30 s after rocuronium administration, respectively; p = 0.003). No
decrease in the tidal volume during the measurements was observed. We conclude that the administration of rocuro-
nium at a dose of 0.6 mg.kg�1 was able to improve facemask ventilation in all cases with a potentially clinically rele-
vant increase in tidal volume. The early use of a neuromuscular blocking agent can be considered as a therapeutic
option in case of difficulty with mask ventilation.

Introduction
Facemask ventilation is one of the fundamental skills
required during induction of anaesthesia. Especially
in cases of difficult tracheal intubation, it is an
important alternative to ensure adequate oxygenation
until the patient0s airway can be secured. Fortu-
nately, the combination of tracheal intubation and
facemask ventilation difficulties is a rare event [1, 2].
Additionally, a difficult airway situation cannot be
well predicted [3, 4], notwithstanding a recent com-
mentary proposing that a binary approach leads to
better prediction [5].
The role of neuromuscular blocking agents in this
scenario is debated [6]. They usually facilitate tracheal

 intubation and might improve facemask ventilation
[7–9]. However, on the other hand, they might impair
ventilation by inducing upper airway collapse [10–12].
Furthermore, return to spontaneous ventilation (a
potential rescue technique) is achieved earlier if neuro-
muscular blocking agents are not used. Many investi-
gations addressing the role of neuromuscular blockade
in mask ventilation were usually performed in patients
with normal airways. The more relevant data would be
from patients with expected difficult facemask ventila-
tion.
Therefore, the aim of the present study was to
assess the influence of complete neuromuscular block
in patients presenting with three or more risk factors
for difficult facemask ventilation [2, 13]. The primary
outcome was the difference in tidal volume before vs.
after onset of complete neuromuscular block.
Methods
The study design was prospective and took place at a
single centre. After obtaining approval from the local
ethics committee (Ethikkommission der €
Arztekammer
Nordrhein, D€
usseldorf, Germany) and with written
informed consent, we recruited adult patients, ASA
physical status 1–3, undergoing elective surgery with
general anaesthesia and presenting with three or more
risk factors for difficult facemask ventilation [2, 13].
Exclusion criteria were: planned awake tracheal
intubation; increased risk of pulmonary aspiration
(gastro-oesophageal reflux, full stomach and intestinal
obstruction); known allergy to the study drugs; preg-
nancy; neuromuscular disorders; drugs affecting neuro-
muscular
block
(e.g.
furosemide,
magnesium
or
cephalosporins); and hepatic or renal insufficiency.
Patients
were
premedicated
with
midazolam
7.5 mg orally. Anaesthesia was induced with a contin-
uous infusion of remifentanil 0.1 lg.kg.min�1, a single
dose of fentanyl 2 lg.kg�1 and propofol 2–3 mg.kg�1
until loss of eyelash reflex. Haemodynamic parameters
were maintained within the normal range (�20% of
baseline values) by additional administration of propo-
fol and remifentanil in case of tachycardia or arterial
hypertension; ephedrine or atropine were administered
if hypotension or bradycardia
occurred. All drug
dosages (including neuromuscular blocking agents)
were administered corrected to ideal body weight. For
men, we calculated the ideal body weight (kg) to be:
height (cm)�100�10%. For women, we calculated:
height (cm)�100�15%.
After loss of eyelash reflex, the patients’ heads were
slightly extended and an oropharyngeal airway was
placed for standardisation. Anaesthesia for all patients
was provided by the same anaesthetist (SS) with > 20
years
clinical
experience.
A
single-use
facemask
(Ambu
TM, Ambu GmbH, Bad Nauheim, Germany) was
positioned on the mouth/nose with both hands simulta-
neously performing a jaw thrust in order to minimise
airway resistance. The ventilator (Primus
TM, Draeger,
L€
ubeck, Germany) was set to deliver pressure-controlled
ventilation with initial peak inspiratory pressure (Pinsp)
of 13 cmH2O, positive expiratory pressure (PEEP)
of 3 cmH2O, 12 breaths.min�1, inspiratory–expiratory
ratio of 1:1, and a fresh gas flow of 6 l.min�1.
If expiratory tidal volume was < 4 ml.kg�1 ideal
body weight, Pinsp was adjusted in incremental steps of
5 cm H2O until the target tidal volume of 4 ml.kg�1
ideal body weight could be delivered. However, if pres-
sure levels > 20 cm H2O had to be provided, a lower
expiratory tidal volume of > 2 ml.kg�1 ideal body
weight or 150 ml, respectively, was accepted (in order
to
reduce
the
risk
of
gastric
distension
and/or
pulmonary aspiration).
Facemask ventilation was defined as impossible
mask ventilation if during ventilation with elevated pres-
sures
> 30 cmH2O,
delivered
tidal
volume
was
< 2 ml.kg�1 ideal body weight, no adequate chest rise
was observed, no end-tidal CO2 was observed, or oxygen
saturation
measured
by
pulse
oximetry
decreased
< 90%. In such instances, the patient was excluded from
the study and a rescue plan was followed according to
the standards of airway management in the department.
Further secondary exclusion criteria after induc-
tion of anaesthesia were potentially life-threatening
emergency situations, such as: pulmonary aspiration;
bronchospasm; severe hemodynamic instability; cardiac
arrest; or allergic reaction.
Additionally, difficulty of facemask ventilation was
assessed by the Warters grading scale for mask ventila-
tion (Table 1) [9].
After adequate ventilation had been established,
respiratory minute volume and expiratory tidal vol-
umes were measured over a period of 30 s (six

 breaths) by checking measurements on the ventilation
machine. This was followed by administering rocuro-
nium 0.6 mg.kg�1 (ideal body weight). Measurements
of respiratory variables were repeated over a period of
30 s (six breaths), starting immediately after rocuro-
nium injection and directly after establishment of com-
plete neuromuscular block (loss of train-of-four, see
below).
Neuromuscular
transmission
was
measured
by
assessment
of
the
train-of-four
ratio
using
acceleromyography (TOF Watch SX, Essex Pharma
GmbH, Munich, Germany) at the right adductor polli-
cis muscle with transcutaneous Ag/AgCl electrodes
(electrocardiogram electrodes; Ambu Inc., MD 21060,
USA); measurements started after induction of anaes-
thesia and were performed in intervals of 15 s. To min-
imise movement-induced changes in twitch response,
the right hand was carefully fixed with tape on an arm
board. Block onset was defined as the complete absence
of contractions during train-of-four stimulation.
Differences in mean tidal volume (ml) were evalu-
ated over time (baseline/rocuronium injection/com-
plete
neuromuscular
block)
using
a
linear
mixed
model for repeated measures with fixed effects group
(easy/difficulty in mask ventilation), time and the
interaction of group and time [14]. An unstructured
variance–covariance
matrix
was
specified
for
the
repeated effect time. Pairwise post-hoc contrasts were
derived from estimated marginal means. A Bonferroni
correction was applied to guard against type-1 error
inflation due to multiple testing. Bivariate correlation
was calculated according to Pearson. Values of p
< 0.05
were
considered
to
indicate
statistical
significance. Calculations were done with SPSS Statis-
tics 24 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA) and SigmaPlot
12.3 (Systat Software, Inc., San Jose, CA, USA).
Based on results from previous studies [15, 16], we
expected a mean (SD) change in tidal volume over
time of 100–150 (300) ml. To detect such differences
with a power of at least 95% at two-sided signficance
level 5%, the paired t-test requires about 120 data pairs
[17]. Thus, a repeated measures ANOVA based on
120 patients with one between-subject factor (i.e.
group) and one within-subject factor (i.e. time) should
have ample power to detect relevant differences, even
in the presence of some drop-outs [14].
Results
Of the 120 patients who were included in the study,
seven patients were not studied because the study pro-
tocol was not followed (incorrect drug doses). Baseline
characteristics and the prevalence of risk factors for
difficulty in mask ventilation of the remaining 113
patients are displayed in Tables 2 and 3.
In all, 27 patients (23.8%) reached a score of 4 or
more on the Warters scale (Table 1) and were consid-
ered as difficult to mask ventilate due to one or a com-
bination of the following reasons. In 13 patients
(11.5%), the Pinsp reached > 20 cm H2O (Fig. 1). In

 two cases (2%), leakage impeded adequate ventilation.
In another 17 patients (15%), the desired tidal volume
of 4 ml.kg�1 ideal body weight was not achieved ini-
tially with pressure levels < 20 cm H2O. In all these
cases, the delivered expiratory tidal volume exceeded
2 ml.kg�1,
or
150 ml,
respectively;
therefore
the
patients received rocuronium and measurements were
performed as scheduled.
With regard to the primary outcome measure,
median (IQR [range]) tidal volume of all patients
increased from 350 (260–492 [80–850]) ml at baseline,
by 48% to 517 (373–667 [100–1250]) ml 30 s after
rocuronium administration; p < 0.001). After onset of
complete neuromuscular block, a tidal volume of 600
(433–750 [250–1303]) ml was observed, corresponding
to an increase of 71% from baseline values (p < 0.001),
and 16% from values obtained 30 s after rocuronium
administration, respectively; p = 0.003. Of note, no
cases with a decrease in the tidal volume during the
measurements were observed. Initial tidal volumes were
lower in the sub-group of patients who were difficult to
mask ventilate as compared with patients who were
easy to ventilate. However, after rocuronium injection,
tidal volumes increased in both groups compared with
initial values. Therefore, 30 s after injection of rocuro-
nium and after the onset of neuromuscular block, dif-
ferences between groups were lost (Fig. 1).
A total of 51 patients (45.1%) could be mask ven-
tilated sufficiently with the initial settings of the venti-
lator. However, the majority required higher pressures
in order to reach desired tidal volumes, the mean (SD)
pressure for all patients was 16.5 (3.9) cmH2O. Pres-
sures in the sub-group of patients who were difficult
to mask ventilate were 19.9 (5.6) cmH2O and therefore
higher than in patients who were easy to ventilate
(15.5 (2.5) cmH2O). Additionally, patients with BMI
> 40 kg.m�2
required
higher
inspiratory
pressures
(19.2
(5.1) cm
H2O)
than
patients
with
BMI
<30 kg.m�2 (15.5 (3.1) cm H2O); p = 0.01, Fig. 2).
Mean (SD) oxygen saturation increased during
measurements from 97.5 (4.3)% initially to 99.2 (1.8)%
30 s after rocuronium administration (p < 0.01); and
99.5 (1.5)% at the onset of neuromuscular blockade
(p < 0.01). However, in five patients, a temporary
decrease in oxygen saturations below 90% occurred
during
mask
ventilation
(before
administration
of
rocuronium), which was treated by adjusting peak
pressure limits in all cases. The lowest SaO2 value
measured was 80%.
Two patients were difficult to intubate tracheally
(more than two attempts). Fortunately, mask ventila-
tion could be performed without difficulty in both.
Discussion
Our main findings were that neuromuscular block
improved tidal volume during pressure-controlled ven-
tilation via a facemask by a median of ~250 ml (70%)
in patients presenting with three or more risk factors
for difficult facemask ventilation and in a sub-group of

 patients whose lungs were actually difficult to ventilate.
Of note, we did not observe a single case with deterio-
rating mask ventilation after the onset of neuromuscu-
lar block.
Definitions of difficult facemask ventilation are
variable [18]. Available scales (Han et al., Warters
et al.) rely on individual evaluation rather than exact
measurements [9, 19]. Thus, the reported incidence
varies from 0.08% to 15% depending on the criteria
applied, thereby making direct comparisons of studies
dealing with this topic difficult [1]. This might con-
tribute
to the fact
that results vary substantially
between studies. The Han scale is a simple scoring sys-
tem using four grades from 1 (ventilation without
adjuncts) to 4 (unable to ventilate). The Han scale was
not applicable for our investigation: due to the sched-
uled use of an oral airway and a two-handed tech-
nique,
all
of
our
patients
would
have
been
automatically classified as grade 3.
The Warters scale is a more appropriate score,
adding points if measures such as oral airway, two-
handed technique, high pressures etc. are required to
achieve the desired tidal volume. Therefore, it reflects
more accurately the measures performed in our study.
A disadvantage of the score is that the target tidal
volume was originally defined as > 5 ml.kg�1, which is
higher than the minimum tidal volume recommended
by other authors [16, 20]. The decision to use the
Warters scale probably influenced the proportion of
patients whose lungs were considered to be difficult to
ventilate in our study: If we had used 5 ml.kg�1 as a
target tidal volume, either the required pressures would
have been substantially higher in many patients, or the
target tidal volume would not have been achieved in a
higher proportion of cases. Thus, both situations
would have increased the number of patients with a
score of 4 or higher on the Warters scale.
An advantage of the present study was the use of
pressure-controlled ventilation, both hands and an
oropharyngeal airway device in all cases. With this
‘two-handed-jaw-thrust technique’ adopted from Joffe
et al., greater tidal volumes can be achieved than with
one-handed manual ventilation alone [16]. Addition-
ally, we facilitated the comparison of our data by pro-
viding clearly defined, identical and optimal settings
for facemask ventilation without any changes during
measurements. Furthermore, the documentation of
the onset of the neuromuscular block with accelerom-
etry contributed to the reliability of our data.
Another advantage of the present investigation is
the assessment of patients not only at risk for difficult
facemask ventilation, but being in fact actually difficult
to ventilate via facemask. Several studies have assessed
the influence of neuromuscular blocking agents, but
most of them did not include many patients who were
difficult to ventilate [8, 9, 15, 20, 21]. However, this is
the sub-group of real interest. If a patient's lungs are
easy to ventilate, a slight deterioration does not matter.
Nevertheless, in the scenario of difficult facemask ven-
tilation, even small changes in tidal volume may be
crucial.
The present investigation has several limitations.
We did not observe any cases with impossible mask
ventilation, most likely due to the fact that this situa-
tion, fortunately, is a very rare event. Therefore, the
important question whether to administer neuromus-
cular blocking agents in a ‘cannot ventilate situation’
cannot be answered by our data.
Some of the underlying causes for difficulty in
mask ventilation are not influenced by neuromuscular
blocking agents, such as obesity, presence of a beard

number of (binned) observations.

esz et al. | The effect of rocuronium on difficult facemask ventilation
 etc. On the other hand, several problems are caused by
supraglottic
obstruction,
laryngospasm
or
by
the
administration of high doses of opioids [10]. In these
situations, a neuromuscular blocking agent might be
beneficial in order to establish adequate ventilation.
However, whether such causes can be discerned in an
emergency situation, remains speculative.
Another methodological problem is that changes
in the depth of anaesthesia over time might also con-
tribute to changes in ventilation variables, even in the
absence of neuromuscular blocking agents. In this
regard, the second measurement directly after rocuro-
nium administration in our investigation might repre-
sent a state of deeper anaesthesia than compared
with baseline, yet without significant neuromuscular
block, because even a fast acting drug such as rocuro-
nium does not produce a complete neuromuscular
block within a few seconds when administered at the
dose used in our study. Therefore, the increase in
tidal volumes might have been caused by deeper
anaesthesia. This interpretation might explain why
other authors have not observed improved ventilation
after onset of neuromuscular block [15]. Thus, a con-
trol
group
without
neuromuscular
blocking
drugs
would probably have been advantageous to exclude
these effects.
Several studies investigating the effect of neuro-
muscular blocking agents on facemask
ventilation
confirm our results. Sachdeva et al. observed improved
ventilation in 125 patients with normal airway anat-
omy
[21].
They
administered
pressure-controlled
ventilation similar to our method. No case of a dete-
rioration in ventilation after injection of rocuronium
was documented. However, difficulty in mask ventila-
tion was described in only eight patients classified by
the Han scale [21]. Thus, the authors recommended
further research in patients with difficult airway anat-
omy. Warters et al. investigated 90 patients during
rocuronium-induced neuromuscular block in a pla-
cebo-controlled study. They also observed a significant
improvement in mask ventilation following the onset
of neuromuscular block in all cases. Most of the
patients in their cohort were easy to ventilate, which is
reflected by mean Warters scale ventilation scores of
2.3 initially and 1.2 after rocuronium. In a review of
paediatric patients, the use of neuromuscular blocking
agents in order to improve ventilation was recom-
mended by Engelhardt et al. [7].
In contrast, several authors came to different con-
clusions. Goodwin et al. did not find any differences
before and after neuromuscular blockade in 30 patients
with normal airways [15]. Ikeda et al. compared the
effects of rocuronium or succinylcholine in 31 patients
whose lungs were ventilated with a pressure-controlled
mode. Although rocuronium did not influence ventila-
tion, succinylcholine improved tidal volume [8].
Recently, Joffe et al. studied 210 patients before
and after neuromuscular blockade. Ventilation was
performed using a manual single-hand technique; drug
dosages were left to the discretion of the attending
anaesthetist and 20% of the patients presented with
three or more risk factors for difficulty in mask venti-
lation. Overall, tidal volume improved after onset of
the
block,
by
about
50 ml.
However,
they
also
observed deterioration in ventilation parameters in 40
patients after onset of neuromuscular blockade. No
patient became impossible to ventilate. The authors
concluded that facemask ventilation was not worse
after administration of neuromuscular blocking agents
[20].
Since
we
found
that
neuromuscular
blockade
improved mask ventilation, early use of a neuromuscu-
lar blocking agent should be considered as a therapeu-
tic option. Nevertheless, checking the ability to mask
ventilate
before
administration
of
neuromuscular
blocking agents remains important, because it provides
useful information about the non-paralysed condition
of the patient’s airway [22]. If difficulty in mask venti-
lation is observed before paralysis, a short-acting neu-
romuscular blocking drug should always be preferred
over a long-acting one to maximise the chance of
return of spontaneous ventilation [22, 23].
