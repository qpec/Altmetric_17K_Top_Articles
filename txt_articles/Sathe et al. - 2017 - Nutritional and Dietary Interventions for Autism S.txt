abstract
CONTEXT: Children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) frequently use special diets or 
receive nutritional supplements to treat ASD symptoms.
OBJECTIVES: Our objective was to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of dietary interventions 
or nutritional supplements in ASD.
DATA SOURCES: Databases, including Medline and PsycINFO.
STUDY SELECTION: Two investigators independently screened studies against predetermined 
criteria.
DATA EXTRACTION: One investigator extracted data with review by a second investigator. 
Investigators independently assessed the risk of bias and strength of evidence (SOE) (ie, 
confidence in the estimate of effects).
RESULTS: Nineteen randomized controlled trials (RCTs), 4 with a low risk of bias, evaluated 
supplements or variations of the gluten/casein-free diet and other dietary approaches. 
Populations, interventions, and outcomes varied. Ω-3 supplementation did not affect 
challenging behaviors and was associated with minimal harms (low SOE). Two RCTs of 
different digestive enzymes reported mixed effects on symptom severity (insufficient SOE). 
Studies of other supplements (methyl B12, levocarnitine) reported some improvements in 
symptom severity (insufficient SOE). Studies evaluating gluten/casein-free diets reported 
some parent-rated improvements in communication and challenging behaviors; however, 
data were inadequate to make conclusions about the body of evidence (insufficient SOE). 
Studies of gluten- or casein-containing challenge foods reported no effects on behavior 
or gastrointestinal symptoms with challenge foods (insufficient SOE); 1 RCT reported no 
effects of camel’s milk on ASD severity (insufficient SOE). Harms were disparate.
LIMITATIONS: Studies were small and short-term, and there were few fully categorized 
populations or concomitant interventions.
CONCLUSIONS: There is little evidence to support the use of nutritional supplements or dietary 
therapies for children with ASD.

 Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) 
is characterized by impairments in 
social interaction, communication, 
and behavior as well as sensory 
challenges. Substantial evidence 
supports benefits of specific 
behavioral, educational, and some 
pharmacologic interventions for 
children with ASD. However, given 
the limits of available treatments 
in improving core and associated 
ASD symptoms, substantial resource 
challenges in accessing evidence-
based treatment approaches, and 
perceptions regarding lessened 
risks of treatment, many families, 
if not a majority of families, pursue 
dietary and nutritional approaches as 
components of treatment.1 
– 
11 Given 
limitations in the existing research 
base, families and providers alike 
often struggle to understand the 
safety and potential benefit of such 
approaches.
Proponents of the frequently used 
gluten/casein-free (GFCF) diet 
posit varied theories (eg, excess 
opioid peptide levels) regarding 
why individuals with ASD may have 
altered metabolism of gluten or 
casein proteins that may negatively 
affect behavior.12 
– 
14 Evidence to 
support specific theories, however, 
is lacking.15, 
16 Studies have also 
explored differences in nutrient 
status in children with and without 
ASD and potential correlations with 
ASD symptoms as well as the effects 
of vitamin supplementation. The 
results of these studies have been 
inconclusive.3, 
 
17 
– 
28
Despite limited evidence and limited 
understanding of the potential 
mechanisms underlying variations 
in nutrition and metabolism that 
may affect behavior, specialized 
or restricted diets and nutritional 
supplementation are frequently used 
treatments in children with ASD. In 
the present review, a component of 
an Agency for Healthcare Research 
and Quality–commissioned update 
of a comparative effectiveness 
review of therapies for children with 
ASD conducted by the Vanderbilt 
Evidence-based Practice Center, 
29  
we examine the evidence 
specifically for nutritional or dietary 
interventions in children with ASD.

search strategy and study selection
We searched the Medline database 
via PubMed, Embase, and the 
Cochrane Library from January 
2010 to September 2016 using 
a combination of controlled 
vocabulary and key terms related to 
interventions for ASD (eg, autism, 
ASD, therapy). We note that the 
original review, 
31 which the current 
report updates, included studies 
published from January 2000 to 
2011. We also hand-searched the 
reference lists of included articles 
and recent reviews addressing ASD 
therapies to identify potentially 
relevant articles.
We developed inclusion criteria in 
consultation with an expert panel 
of clinicians and researchers (Table 
1). We included comparative study 
designs (eg, randomized controlled 
trials [RCTs] and prospective or 
retrospective cohort studies) and 
studies published in English. We 
required that eligible RCTs have a 
total minimum sample size of 10. We 
required a higher minimum sample 
size (n = 20) for other comparative 
studies because they typically have 
fewer controls for bias than RCTs.
data extraction and Analysis
One investigator extracted data 
regarding study design, descriptions 
of study populations, intervention 
and comparison groups, and 
baseline and outcome data using 
a standardized form. A second 
investigator independently verified 
the accuracy of the extraction and 
made revisions as needed. Significant 
heterogeneity in interventions and 
outcomes reported precluded meta-
analysis; thus, we synthesized studies 
qualitatively.
Assessment of study Risk of Bias 
and strength of evidence
Two investigators independently 
evaluated the overall methodologic 
risk of bias of individual studies 
using the ASD-specific assessment 
approach developed and used in 
previous reviews of interventions 
for ASD.29,

 approach described in the full 
review34 to determine low, moderate, 
or high risk of bias ratings.
Assessment of the strength of 
the evidence (SOE) reflects the 
confidence that we have in the 
stability of treatment effects in the 
face of future research. The degree 
of confidence that the observed 
effect of an intervention is unlikely 
to change in additional research, 
the SOE, is presented as insufficient, 
low, moderate, or high. Assessments 
are based on consideration of study 
limitations, consistency in the 
direction of the effect, directness 
in measuring intended outcomes, 
precision of effect, and reporting 
bias.35 We determined the strength 
of evidence separately for major 
intervention-outcome pairs using a 
prespecified approach described in 
detail in the full review.34
ResuLTs
Our searches (conducted for the 
broader systematic review update30) 
identified 6583 citations, of which 
19 RCTs (reported in multiple 
publications) met inclusion criteria 
and addressed diet or nutritional 
therapies (Fig 1).36

Table 2 outlines study characteristics

treatment durations ranged from 
7 days to 2 years, and sample sizes 
ranged from 12 to 92 (total N = 732). 
Follow-up occurred immediately 
posttreatment in all studies.
Ω-3 Fatty Acid supplementation
Little evidence supports the 
effectiveness of Ω-3 supplementation 
to improve core or associated 
ASD symptoms. Three RCTs of 
Ω-3s versus placebo (low41 and 
moderate39, 
 
40 risk of bias) reported 
no significant group differences 
on most measures of challenging 
behavior, communication, language, 
and adaptive behavior.39– 
41 One 
study reported significantly 
improved scores in the placebo 
group compared with the Ω-3 group 
in externalizing behaviors after 6 
months of treatment, 
39 and another 
reported a significant improvement 
in parent ratings of stereotypy and 
lethargy in children receiving Ω-3 
supplements compared with those 
receiving placebo; teacher ratings 
were not significantly different.40 
Another RCT (moderate risk of 
bias) of dietary docosahexanoic 
acid (DHA) supplementation versus 
placebo reported improvement 
in parent-rated social skills in 
children receiving placebo versus 
those receiving docosahexanoic 
acid, whereas teachers rated 
communication as more improved in 
the treatment group compared with 
placebo.37 Scores on other measures 
did not differ significantly between 
groups. Supplemental Table 3 reports 
outcome data for all studies.
digestive enzyme supplementation
Evidence is inadequate to assess 
the effects of short-term digestive 
enzyme supplements. Two RCTs 
(moderate risk of bias) addressed 
digestive enzyme supplements 
compared with placebo: 1 evaluated 
a proteolytic enzyme supplement 
(Peptizyde)49 and the other a 
digestive enzyme supplement 
(Neo-Digestin)36; both supplements 
contained papain and pepsin or 
peptidase. The Peptizyde RCT 
reported no significant differences in 
measures of behavior, sleep quality, 
or gastrointestinal symptoms, 
and no significant differences in 
adverse effects.49 In a 3-month trial 
of Neo-Digestin versus placebo, 
symptom severity scores improved 
significantly in the treatment group 
compared with placebo.36
other supplements
Two RCTs (low38 and moderate58 
risk of bias) addressed methyl 
B12 supplementation. Clinical 
Global Impression (CGI) scores 
improved significantly in the 
methyl B12 group in 1 RCT (effect 
size = 0.84, P = .005), but studies

 reported few other significant 
group differences in measures of 
behavior or communication.58 Two 
RCTs of levocarnitine (moderate51 
and high42 risk of bias) reported 
improvements in symptom severity 
in the levocarnitine group compared 
with placebo, but scores on other 
behavioral measures or adverse 
effects did not differ between 
groups.42 In the second RCT, 
symptom severity did not differ 
between groups after 6 months of 
treatment.51
GFCF diets
Data to assess the effects of GFCF 
diets are limited because dietary 
approaches and outcome measures 
varied among studies as did control 
diets and monitoring of adherence 
to GFCF diets. Four RCTs (in multiple 
publications) compared GFCF diets 
to either an unaltered diet44, 
 
45, 
 
54 
– 
57 
or a low-sugar diet (total N across 
studies = 82).53 One RCT (moderate 
risk of bias) reported no significant 
differences between groups on 
measures of development or 
behavior, although the control group 
improved significantly from baseline 
on visual reception, withdrawal, 
aggression, and attention subscales 
(P values < .05) Another crossover 
RCT (moderate risk of bias) similarly 
reported no statistically significant 
differences between groups on 
measures of symptom severity or 
language, although parents of 7 
of the 15 children participating in 
the study reported improvements 
in language.56, 
 
57 In a retrospective 
analysis of videotapes recorded 
during the study period, investigators 
found no significant group 
differences in verbal communication 
between children in the diet or 
control groups or between children 
whose parents reported language 
improvements after the study period 
and those whose parents did not.
One RCT (high risk of bias) 
reported significant parent-rated 
improvements in communication, 
resistance to communication, social 
isolation, repetitive or challenging 
behavior, and overall impairment in 
children on a GFCF diet compared 
with those on a usual diet (P values 
≤ .007).54, 
 
55 Children on the GFCF 
diet also improved significantly on 
tests of cognitive skills, motor skills, 
verbal and social communication, 
anxiety, and reaction to changes in 
environment and routine compared 
with control children (P values 
< .05). Another high risk of bias 
RCT with 24-month follow-up of 
participants reported few differences 
in behavioral measures between 
children on a GFCF diet and those 
with no dietary restrictions44, 
 
45; ASD 
symptoms improved significantly 
in participants in the GFCF diet 
group versus the no diet group at 
12 months, but were not different 
on any measure in a subset of 
participants followed for 24 months.

 other dietary Approaches
One RCT (high risk of bias) 
compared a gluten-free diet to a 
usual diet and reported significant 
improvements in gastrointestinal 
symptoms (stomachache, bloating, 
constipation) from baseline in 
the gluten-free diet group, but 
not in the control group. Diarrhea 
did not improve significantly in 
either group. Stereotyped behavior 
and communication improved 
significantly in the gluten-free group 
compared with control children 
(P values ≤ .005).52 Another small 
RCT (low risk of bias) comparing 
a gluten- and dairy-free diet with 
a diet including both gluten and 
dairy reported no significant 
group differences in challenging 
behavior (hyperactivity, irritability, 
inattention).47
Two small RCTs (low59 and 
moderate46 risk of bias) evaluated 
the “challenges” of gluten- or casein-
containing foods, but the evidence 
is inadequate to determine if short-
term gluten- or casein-containing 
foods affect ASD symptoms or 
gastrointestinal function. One RCT 
that randomized children who were 
maintaining GFCF diets to foods 
with gluten, gluten and casein, or 
placebo foods reported no significant 
group differences in measures of 
challenging behaviors or measures of 
sleep quality and stool frequency.43 
Another RCT (moderate risk of bias) 
assessing the effects of introducing 
gluten/casein-containing foods 
versus placebo foods similarly 
reported no significant effects of 
added gluten or casein on behavior 
or gastrointestinal symptoms.46 
Finally, a single RCT (high risk of 
bias) compared boiled or raw camel’s 
milk with cow’s milk and reported no 
significant differences in ASD severity 
between groups after 2 weeks of 
treatment.48
harms
Studies that reported harms either 
reported no significant difference 
between the intervention group 
and the control group, or reported 0 
harms for each group. Harms were 
disparate and the clinical significance 
was generally difficult to assess 
(Supplemental Table 4).
soe
Ω-3 fatty acid supplementation and 
placebo did not affect challenging 
behaviors and was associated with 
minimal harms. Our confidence 
in these conclusions is low (low 
SOE). Despite the number of RCTs 
with low or moderate risk of bias 
addressing other supplements, data 
were inadequate to make conclusions 
about all clinical efficacy and harms 
outcomes because only a few small 
studies addressed each supplement 
(insufficient SOE). Similarly, although 
multiple RCTs evaluated variations 
of a GFCF diet, studies addressed 
different outcomes and different 
approaches to restricted and control 
diets; thus, data were inadequate to 
make conclusions about the body 
of evidence (insufficient SOE) or 
about other dietary interventions 
(challenge foods, camel’s milk).
dIsCussIon
Despite their widespread reported 
use, little evidence supports 
the effectiveness of nutritional 
supplements or the GFCF diet for 
improving ASD symptoms. Harms 
reported in studies were generally 
considered mild, but the long-term 
effects of these therapies are not well 
understood. Although the conduct 
of studies generally improved from 
those reported in our 2011 review, 
evidence remains insufficient for 
most interventions given the small 
sample sizes, lack of longer term 
follow-up, and heterogeneous 
agents and populations. Few studies 
assessed the effect of concomitant 
behavioral or other therapies, 
although many children with ASD 
receive multiple interventions.
These findings generally align 
with conclusions in recent 
reviews addressing specific diets 
or supplements. One Cochrane 
review evaluating Ω-3 fatty acids 
reported no evidence for effects on 
social interaction, communication, 
hyperactivity, or stereotypy.27
Another review of GFCF diets 
included 32 studies, typically with 
high risk of bias, and noted scarce 
evidence for GFCF diets, with positive 
effects reported only in lower quality 
studies.60
Even without a clear evidence 
base documenting safety and 
efficacy, many families of children 
with ASD use diet and nutritional 
approaches.61, 
 
62 Parents have cited 
better alignment with their personal 
views as well as perceived fewer side 
effects than conventional medications 
as reasons for using “complementary 
or alternative” therapies, including 
restricted diets and nutritional 
supplements.5 
– 
9 Caregivers have also 
reported making treatment decisions 
about such therapies without a 
clinician’s input, noting a perceived 
unwillingness to consider potential 
benefits among clinicians, even in the 
face of few evidence-based effective 
therapies.63 These findings continue 
to highlight the need for shared 
decision-making among providers 
and families, including understanding 
of family motivations for using 
specific therapies and discussion of 
balancing potential benefits with 
potential risks and resource and time 
costs to families.64, 
Limitations of the Review Process
We included studies published in 
English only and did not include 
unpublished data. Although our 
preliminary scan of non-English 
publications identified few potential 
eligible studies, we recognize that 
some nutritional supplements may 
have been studied only in non-
Western countries and will not be 
addressed in the current review. 
We also included only comparative

ConCLusIons
Overall, studies of nutritional 
supplements or specialized 
diets were typically small and 
short-term (<6 months) and 
provided little evidence regarding 
the potential effects of these 
approaches. Several agents were 
addressed in single studies, which 
limit conclusions about their 
effects. These findings can help 
to inform shared caregiver and 
clinician decision-making about 
therapies for children with ASD.
