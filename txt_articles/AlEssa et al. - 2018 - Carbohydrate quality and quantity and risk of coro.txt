ABSTRACT
Background: The carbohydrate-to-fiber ratio is a recommended
measure of carbohydrate quality; however, its relation to incident
coronary heart disease (CHD) is not currently known.
Objective: We aimed to assess the relation between various measures
of carbohydrate quality and incident CHD.
Design: Data on diet and lifestyle behaviors were prospectively
collected on 75,020 women and 42,865 men participating in the
Nurses’ Health Study (NHS) and the Health Professionals Follow-
Up Study (HPFS) starting in 1984 and 1986, respectively, and every
2–4 y thereafter until 2012. All participants were free of known di-
abetes mellitus, cancer, or cardiovascular disease at baseline. Cox
proportional hazards regression models were used to assess the rela-
tion between dietary measures of carbohydrate quality and incident
CHD.
Results: After 1,905,047 (NHS) and 921,975 (HPFS) person-years
of follow-up, we identified 7,320 cases of incident CHD. In models
adjusted for age, lifestyle behaviors, and dietary variables, the high-
est quintile of carbohydrate intake was not associated with incident
CHD (pooled-RR = 1.04; 95% CI: 0.96, 1.14; P-trend = 0.31). Total
fiber intake was not associated with risk of CHD (pooled-RR = 0.94;
95% CI: 0.85, 1.03; P-trend = 0.72), while cereal fiber was as-
sociated with a lower risk for incident CHD (pooled-RR = 0.80;
95% CI: 0.74, 0.87; P-trend < 0.0001). In fully adjusted models,
the carbohydrate-to–total fiber ratio was not associated with inci-
dent CHD (pooled-RR = 1.04; 95% CI: 0.96, 1.13; P-trend = 0.46).
However, the carbohydrate-to–cereal fiber ratio and the starch-to–
cereal fiber ratio were associated with an increased risk for incident
CHD (pooled-RR = 1.20; 95% CI: 1.11, 1.29; P-trend < 0.0001,
and pooled-RR = 1.17; 95%CI: 1.09, 1.27; P-trend < 0.0001,
respectively).
Conclusion: Dietary cereal fiber appears to be an important com-
ponent of carbohydrate quality. The carbohydrate-to–cereal fiber
ratio and the starch-to–cereal fiber ratio, but not the carbohydrate-to-
fiber ratio, was associated with an increased risk for incident CHD.
Future research should focus on how various measures of carbo-
hydrate quality are associated with CHD prevention. This trial was
registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT03214861.

INTRODUCTION
Despite significant advances in cardiovascular medicine over
the past 50 y, heart disease remains the leading cause of death
for both men and women in the United States (1). While data
from NHANES indicate a decline in the prevalence of major coro-
nary heart disease (CHD) risk factors such as hypertension, dys-
lipidemia, and tobacco use (2), other factors such as overweight
and obesity, diabetes, and the metabolic syndrome remain highly
prevalent (3–5). Many of the chronic conditions which predispose
to CHD are largely driven by unhealthy behaviors, such as poor
dietary habits and physical inactivity. In fact, ≤80% of the risk
for CHD events could be attributable to a lack of adherence to a
healthy lifestyle (6, 7).
While diet has always been a major focus in the prevention
of CHD, guidelines have historically emphasized a low-fat (and
in particular low–saturated fat) diet (8, 9). This has had im-
portant clinical implications as many individuals have adopted
low-fat, high-carbohydrate diets in an attempt to reduce their
HBA and RC are joint first co-authors.

risk for CHD. Compared with total carbohydrates, saturated fat
intake was not significantly associated with CHD or cardiovascu-
lar disease outcomes (10). However, saturated fat was associated
with increased risk of CHD compared with high-quality carbohy-
drates such whole grains or unsaturated fats (11). Although the
associations between total daily carbohydrate consumption and
CHD have been inconsistent (12, 13), certain sources of carbohy-
drates such as refined grains and added sugars have been found
to be associated with CHD (14, 15).
In 2010, the American Heart Association defined an ideal diet
as part of its 2020 Impact Goals. One component of the ideal diet
was fiber-rich whole grains, defined as having a carbohydrate-to-
fiber ratio of <10:1 (16). Research suggests that this measure of
carbohydrate quality appears to be superior to other consumer-
oriented methods for identifying a restricted set of grain foods
commonly consumed in Boston-area markets (17). In addition, a
recent study indicated that this ratio can also be useful in eval-
uating the overall carbohydrate quality of the diet where it was
positively associated with risk of type 2 diabetes among women
(18). However, its relation to CHD outcomes has not been de-
fined. Therefore, the purpose of the present study was to examine
the association between the carbohydrate-to-fiber ratio and other
measures of carbohydrate quality and quantity and incident CHD
in a large cohort of US men and women.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study population
The Nurses’ Health Study (NHS) was initiated in 1976 as a
prospective cohort study, where 121,701 female registered nurses
between the ages of 30 and 55 y were recruited from 11 US
states. The Health Professionals Follow-Up Study (HPFS) was
initiated in 1986 and recruited 51,529 US men between the ages
of 40 and 75 y. Every 2 y, participants updated their infor-
mation on medical history, lifestyle, and incidence of chronic
diseases using validated questionnaires. Follow-up rates are
≥90% of potential person-years of follow-up, and mortality
follow-up is >98%. In the current investigation we excluded
participants with a baseline history of diabetes, cardiovascular
disease, or cancer because these diagnoses could result in impor-
tant dietary changes (19). We also excluded participants who left
≥10 items blank on the food-frequency questionnaire (FFQ), or
who had implausible energy intakes (<500 or >3500 kcal/d for
women and <800 or >4200 kcal/d for men). The final analysis in-
cluded 75,020 women and 42,865 men (Supplemental Figure 1).
The study was approved by the Human Research Committee of
Brigham and Women’
s Hospital and Harvard TH Chan School of
Public Health in Boston, MA.
Assessment of diet
In the NHS and HPFS, an FFQ was administered at baseline in
1984 and 1986, respectively, and every 4 y thereafter, until 2010.
Participants were asked how often on average (“never” to “six or
more times per day”) they consumed a specified common por-
tion size or serving size of specific foods. The validity and repro-
ducibility of the FFQ in measuring food intake has been demon-
strated previously (20–23). In a prior validation study involving
a subsample of 173 nurses in the Boston area, FFQ assessment
of total carbohydrate and total fiber were moderately correlated
with the average of four 1-wk diet records (total carbohydrate,
r = 0.64; total fiber, r = 0.56) (20, 24). Carbohydrate-rich food
items had similar correlation coefficients (cold breakfast cereal,
r = 0.79; white bread, r = 0.71; dark bread, r = 0.77; pasta
and rice, r = 0.35; potatoes, r = 0.66) (21). The main exposure
variables were carbohydrate, starch, total fiber, cereal fiber, fruit
fiber, vegetable fiber, and ratios of carbohydrate-to–total fiber,
carbohydrate-to–cereal fiber, starch-to–total fiber, and starch to
cereal fiber. Nutrient intakes were calculated by multiplying the
frequency of consumption by the nutrient content of the specified
portion size of each food. Then, the nutrient content of all food
items in a participant’
s diet were summed to estimate the indi-
vidual nutrient intakes. The nutrient contents were determined
using the USDA Food Composition tables and complemented
with information from manufacturers (25). All dietary variables
were adjusted for total energy intake using the residual method
to control for confounding and removal of extraneous variation
due to differences in body size, metabolic efficiency, and physical
activity (26).
Assessment of coronary heart disease
The primary outcome of this analysis was incident CHD (de-
fined as either fatal CHD event or nonfatal myocardial infarction)
occurring between 1984 and 2012 in the NHS and 1986 and 2012
in the HPFS. Fatal CHD events were ascertained by next of kin or
the National Death Index and confirmed by medical records, au-
topsy reports, or death certificates. CHD was confirmed as the
etiology if it was listed as the cause of death, the most likely
cause of death, or if a history of prior CHD was available. Non-
fatal myocardial infarction was confirmed on the basis of medi-
cal records using criteria proposed by the WHO—characteristic
symptoms plus typical electrocardiographic changes consistent
with myocardial infarction or the presence of elevated cardiac
biomarkers (27).
Assessment of covariates
On a biennial basis, questionnaires were distributed to study
participants, who provided updated information on age, weight,
and medical history (e.g., menopausal status, hormone use, vita-
min use, and the presence or absence of hypertension and hyperc-
holesterolemia). Physical activity was characterized as metabolic
equivalent (MET) hours per week.
Statistical analysis
Person-years of follow-up were calculated from the time that
the initial questionnaire was returned (1984 for NHS; 1986 for
HPFS) to the end of the follow-up period (2012 for both), date of
initial confirmed CHD event, or loss to follow-up, whichever was
earliest. Associations between carbohydrate, starch, total fiber,
cereal fiber, glycemic index, glycemic load, and the ratios of
carbohydrate-to–total fiber, carbohydrate-to–cereal fiber, starch-
to–total fiber, and starch to cereal fiber were assessed at baseline
among study participants using Pearson correlation coefficients.
Time-varying Cox proportional hazards regression was used to
estimate the relative risk of CHD by quintiles of energy-adjusted
intakes of various carbohydrate variables, stratified by 5-y age
categories. A test for linear trend was performed using quintiles

of the carbohydrate exposure variable as a continuous variable by
assigning the median values of the quintile to the variable.
Cumulative averages of all available dietary data were used in
order to reduce within-person variation, and to best characterize
long-term dietary patterns (19). To minimize confounding due to
change in diet after diagnosis of chronic diseases, dietary expo-
sure variables were not updated after the diagnosis of diabetes
mellitus, cancer, or stroke. To minimize the influence of outliers,
study participants were grouped into quintiles of energy-adjusted
carbohydrate exposure variables, with the reference group repre-
senting the lowest quintile.
Several potential confounders were adjusted for in our Cox
models. Model 1 was age-adjusted (<50, 50 to <55, 55 to <60,
60 to <65, or ≥65 y). Model 2 included various medical history
and lifestyle-related covariates such as BMI (in kg/m2; <21, 21
to <23, 23 to <25, 25 to <27, 27 to <30, 30 to <33, 33 to <35,
35 to <40, or ≥40), race (Caucasian, African American, Native
American, Asian, or Hawaiian), family history of myocardial
infarction (yes or no), menopausal status and postmenopausal
hormone use (premenopause, postmenopausal never user, post-
menopausal current user, or postmenopausal past user), smoking
(never, past, current 1–14 cigarettes/d, current 15–24 cigarettes/d,
or current ≥25 cigarettes/d), alcohol use (0, 0.1 to <5, 5.0 to
<10, 10 to <15, or ≥15 g/d), physical activity level (<3, 3 to
<9, 9 to <18, 18 to <27, or ≥27 MET-h/wk), multivitamin use
(yes or no), aspirin use (yes or no), vitamin E use (yes or no), and
total energy intake (kilocalories per day, in quintiles), in addition
to dietary variables such as polyunsaturated fat–to–saturated
fat ratio and trans fat (percentage of total energy, in quintiles).
Nondietary variables were updated every 2 y, whereas dietary
records were updated every 4 y.
A priori defined stratified analyses and the potential for effect
modification was tested for the associations between cereal fiber,
carbohydrate-to–cereal fiber ratio, starch to cereal fiber ratio, and
CHD by 1) age (<60 and ≥60 y); 2) BMI (<25 and ≥25); 3)
physical activity (HPFS: <22 and ≥22 MET-h/wk; NHS: <10
and ≥10 MET-h/wk); 4) family history of myocardial infarction
(yes or no); and 5) current smoking (yes or no).
Sensitivity analyses were also performed using dietary data
which were updated throughout the follow-up period, even af-
ter the development of intermediate outcomes such as dia-
betes and cancer. Because individuals at higher risk of CHD
may be motivated to improve their diet, mainly increasing
their fruit and vegetable consumption, to alleviate their higher
CHD risk, and therefore potentially causing reverse causation,
we performed a 4-y “lagged” analysis between cereal, fruit,
and vegetable fiber and risk of CHD among both men and
women.
In addition, the potential for nonlinearity of the associa-
tions between cereal fiber, carbohydrate-to–cereal fiber ratio, and
starch-to–cereal fiber ratio was also tested using restricted cubic
splines with 5 knots, 5th, 25.5th, 50th, 72.5th and 95th percentiles
of exposure (28), where we gave all values <Q1 – 3 × IQR the
value of Q1 – 3 × IQR and all values >Q3 + 3 × IQR the value
of Q3 + 3 × IQR. Due to differences in study design, all analyses
were first performed separately in each cohort. To obtain overall
estimates for both cohort studies, hazard ratios from the age and
multivariate adjusted models were combined using a fixed-effects
inverse-variance weighted meta-analysis. All statistical analyses
were 2-sided with a P value <0.05 considered to be significant.
SAS version 9.3 for UNIX (SAS Institute Inc.) was used for all
statistical analyses.
RESULTS
During 1905,049 person-years of follow-up in the NHS there
were a total of 3267 CHD events, and during 921,975 person-
years of follow-up in the HPFS there were 4053 CHD events. The
age-adjusted baseline characteristics of the study participants, ac-
cording to quintiles of carbohydrate, starch, and cereal fiber in-
take, are presented in Table 1. In general, men and women with
higher intakes of carbohydrate and starch had higher glycemic
index and glycemic load values, were more likely to have hyper-
cholesterolemia but were less likely to smoke, and had similar
family histories of CHD to those with lower intakes of carbohy-
drate and starch. Men and women with higher intakes of cereal
fiber were more likely to be physically active, and consumed less
saturated fat and alcohol.
Significant correlations were noted in both study populations
between baseline intakes of carbohydrate, starch, total fiber, ce-
real fiber, starch-to–total fiber ratio, starch-to–cereal fiber ratio,
glycemic index, and glycemic load, with correlation coefficients
ranging from –0.69 (total fiber and carbohydrate-to–total fiber ra-
tio) to 0.95 (carbohydrates and glycemic load) (Supplemental
Table 1).
In fully adjusted models, carbohydrate intake was not associ-
ated with an increased risk of CHD among men [quintile 5 (Q5)
compared with Q1: RR = 1.07; 95% CI: 0.96, 1.20; P-trend =
0.33] or women (Q5 compared with Q1: RR = 1.01; 95% CI:
0.89, 1.14; P-trend = 0.74) (Table 2). Starch intake, however, was
associated with a significantly reduced risk for CHD in men (Q5
compared with Q1: RR = 0.83; 95% CI: 0.74, 0.94; P-trend =
0.004), but not women (Q5 compared with Q1: RR = 1.11; 95%
CI: 0.97, 1.27; P-trend = 0.13). Pooled associations for starch
intake and risk of CHD were nonsignificant (Q5 compared with
Q1: RR = 0.94; 95% CI: 0.86, 1.03; P-trend = 0.11).
In age-adjusted models, there were significant inverse associa-
tions between both total and cereal fiber and incident CHD. How-
ever, after adjusting for all potential confounders in model 2, the
association was nonsignificant (pooled association Q5 compared
with Q1: RR = 0.94; 95% CI: 0.85, 1.03; P-trend = 0.72). Ce-
real fiber, however, was consistently and significantly associated
with a reduced risk of CHD in both populations (pooled asso-
ciation Q5 compared with Q1: RR = 0.80; 95% CI: 0.74, 0.87;
P-trend < 0.0001). Fruit fiber was associated with an increased
risk for CHD in men (Q5 compared with Q1: RR = 1.15; 95% CI:
1.02, 1.29; P-trend = 0.0147) but not women (Q5 compared with
Q1: RR = 0.99; 95% CI: 0.87, 1.13; P-trend = 0.82). However,
in the 4-y lagged sensitivity analysis (Supplemental Table 2),
the positive association between fruit fiber and risk of CHD
among men was diminished (Q5 compared with Q1: RR = 1.11;
95% CI: 0.98, 1.26; P-trend = 0.10) and remained insignificant
among women. Vegetable fiber was not significantly associated
with CHD risk in either men or women (pooled association Q5
compared with Q1: RR = 1.02; 95% CI: 0.94, 1.11; P-trend 0.24).
In addition, in the 4-y lagged analysis the association between
cereal fiber and risk of CHD was only slightly attenuated, and
remained insignificant between vegetable fiber and risk of CHD.
In age-adjusted models, the carbohydrate-to–total fiber ratio
was associated with an elevated risk of CHD in both the men and

1RRs and 95% CIs were calculated with the use of the Cox proportional hazards regression model. Model 1: age adjusted. Model 2: adjusted for age, BMI,
family history of CHD, smoking status, alcohol intake, physical activity level, multivitamin use, aspirin use, vitamin E use, race, total energy, polyunsaturated
fat–to–saturated fat ratio and trans fat (dietary variables all in quintiles). Model for starch was additionally adjusted for cereal fiber, sugar-sweetened beverages,
and fruits and vegetables. Model for total fiber was additionally adjusted for glycemic load. Models for cereal, fruit, and vegetable fibers were additionally
adjusted for glycemic load and the other two subtypes of fiber. CHD, coronary heart disease; HPFS, Health Professionals Follow-Up Study; NHS, Nurses’

the women (Table 3). However, in fully adjusted models this re-
lation became nonsignificant, as was the pooled association (Q5
compared with Q1: RR = 1.04; 95% CI: 0.96, 1.13; P-trend =
0.46). The carbohydrate-to–cereal fiber ratio and the starch-to–
cereal fiber ratio were both consistently and significantly pos-
itively associated with incident CHD in both age-adjusted and
fully adjusted models (pooled association for carbohydrate-to–
cereal fiber ratio Q5 compared with Q1: RR = 1.20; 95% CI:
1.11, 1.29; P-trend < 0.0001; pooled association for the starch-
to–cereal fiber ratio Q5 compared with Q1: RR = 1.17; 95% CI:
1.09, 1.27; P-trend < 0.0001). The starch-to–total fiber ratio was
inversely associated with risk of CHD in fully adjusted models
(pooled association Q5 compared with Q1: RR = 0.88; 95% CI:
0.81, 0.96; P-trend = 0.0095). Overall similar associations were
noted after additional adjustment for baseline hypertension and
hypercholesterolemia (Supplemental Table 3), and after contin-
uously updating dietary variables throughout the follow-up pe-
riod (Supplemental Table 4), with the exception of total car-
bohydrate intake becoming associated with an increased risk of
CHD (Q5 compared with Q1: RR = 1.14; 95% CI: 1.04, 1.24; P-
trend = 0.0008), and the marginal inverse association between the
starch-to–total fiber ratio and risk of CHD, which became non-
significant (Q5 compared with Q1: RR = 0.94; 95% CI: 0.87,
1.03; P-trend = 0.22).
There was no evidence of effect modification of the associa-
tions between cereal fiber, carbohydrate-to–cereal fiber ratio, or
starch-to–cereal fiber ratio and CHD by physical activity (HPFS:
<22 or ≥22 MET-h/wk, NHS: <9 or ≥9 MET-h/wk), family his-
tory of myocardial infarction (yes or no), or current smoking sta-
tus (yes or no) for both men and women (all P-interaction ≥ 0.05).
However, there was significant effect modification of the asso-
ciations between cereal fiber, carbohydrate-to–cereal fiber, and
starch to cereal fiber and risk of CHD by age (<60, ≥60 y) among
women. In an a priori defined stratified analysis, the associations
were stronger among women <60 y old, compared with those
≥60 y old. When comparing extreme quintiles of intake, women
<60 y old and at the highest quintile of cereal fiber, carbohydrate-
to–cereal fiber, and starch to cereal fiber intake had a 45% lower
risk, and a 68% and 76% higher risk of developing CHD, respec-
tively, than did those at the lowest quintile of intake, whereas
women aged ≥60 y had a 23% lower risk, and a 12% and 22%
higher risk of developing CHD, respectively, than did those at the
lowest quintile of intake (all P-interaction ≤ 0.0004) (Table 4).
In addition, cereal fiber and the 2 ratios were significantly associ-
ated with CHD among both age groups (<60 and ≥60 y) in men
(all P-trend ≤ 0.0125).
The associations between cereal fiber, carbohydrate-to–cereal
fiber ratio, and starch-to–cereal fiber ratio and the risk of inci-
dent CHD were also examined in both the HPFS and NHS using
spline regression (Figure 1A–F). All associations were linear in
both men and women (all P-linear relation ≤ 0.005), except for
the association between cereal fiber and incident CHD among
women where there was a plateau around 7 g of cereal fiber/d
(P-nonlinear relation = 0.0012, and P-overall significance of the
curve < 0.0001).
DISCUSSION
A growing body of literature relates various measures of carbo-
hydrate quality to important health outcomes, including diabetes,
CHD, and mortality. In our prospective cohort study, we found
the carbohydrate-to–cereal fiber ratio and the starch-to–cereal
fiber ratio, but not the carbohydrate-to-fiber ratio, to be impor-
tant measures of carbohydrate quality that were associated with
a 20% and 17% increased risk for incident CHD, respectively.

These findings were largely driven by the strong and consistent
inverse association between cereal fiber intake and CHD out-
comes.
We did not find evidence that total daily carbohydrate or starch
intake was associated with an increased risk for incident CHD.
Data from the Framingham Offspring Study, however, did show
evidence of an association between the highest quintile of daily
carbohydrate consumption and low HDL and high triglycerides,
known risk factors for CHD (29). Similarly, data from the Shang-
hai Men’
s and Women’
s Health Study showed that the highest
quartile of daily carbohydrate intake was associated with a nearly
3-fold increase in risk for incident CHD (12). Conversely, and
consistent with our findings, the Singapore Chinese Health Study
showed no evidence of increased risk for CHD according to total
daily carbohydrate and starch intake (13). The Prospective Urban
Rural Epidemiology (PURE) study, a prospective cohort study
with 135,335 participants from 18 countries, has found that par-
ticipants with the highest carbohydrate intake (77% of daily en-
ergy intake) did not have a higher risk of cardiovascular disease
than did those at the lowest quintile of intake (46% of daily en-
ergy intake) (30). However, this study and the PURE study cannot
be compared because most participants of the PURE study were

in low-income countries where the diet was heavily composed of
carbohydrates from refined sources such as white rice—a char-
acteristic of poverty diets, which are also high in sodium and low
in animal fat and vegetable oils, and therefore the individual ef-
fects of diet and poverty cannot be separated. The inconsistent
findings between carbohydrate intake and CHD risk may reflect
the dietary fiber and whole-grain content of the diet in the afore-
mentioned study populations.
In the NHS, we found that total daily fiber and cereal fiber
were associated with an 18% and 33% reduced risk for CHD, re-
spectively. In the HPFS, only cereal fiber was significantly and
inversely associated with CHD risk. These findings are consis-
tent with a recent meta-analysis of 17 cohort studies involving
>900,000 participants where the highest tertile of dietary fiber
intake was associated with a 16% reduced risk of all-cause mor-
tality (31). Fruit and vegetable fiber, however, were not associated
with a significantly reduced risk for CHD in our combined popu-
lations. These findings are similar to prior published data from the
HPFS, where fruit and vegetable fiber were not associated with a
reduced risk of CHD (32). The lack of association between fruit
and vegetable fiber and risk of CHD could be because fiber in
fruits and vegetables works synergistically with the other compo-
nents of the whole foods, which could explain the limited benefit
of isolated or synthetic fiber compared with whole foods such as
fruits and vegetables.
In addition to the inverse association of daily fiber intake and
CHD, and in particular cereal fiber, we found the carbohydrate-
to–cereal fiber ratio and the starch-to–cereal fiber ratio to be im-
portant measures of carbohydrate quality as it relates to CHD.
These ratios likely reflect the extent to which fiber and whole
grains are present in the diet. This is consistent with a large body
of evidence linking whole-grain consumption with important
health outcomes (33). Recently, the Scandinavian HELGA co-
hort observed a 32% reduction in all-cause mortality for women
and a 25% reduction in all-cause mortality for men in the highest
compared with the lowest quartile of whole-grain product con-
sumption (34). Similar associations between whole-grain intake
and all-cause mortality were noted in prior publications involv-
ing the HPFS (35), and with CHD events in the NHS (36). A re-
cent meta-analysis of 18 studies involving >14,000 patients also
found whole-grain consumption to be associated with a 21% re-
duced risk for CHD (37). Much of the benefits from some whole
grains could be completely attributable to the cereal content, but
more detailed feeding studies with exact measures of intake may
be necessary to tease out the factors most responsible for the ben-
eficial effect of cereal whole grains.
Other measures of carbohydrate quality also have strong asso-
ciations with CHD risk. Prior data from the NHS suggest that
diets with a high glycemic load are associated with a nearly
2-fold increased risk for incident CHD (14). Similarly, in a
meta-analysis of 37 prospective cohort studies, diets with a high
glycemic index and glycemic load were both associated with an
increased risk for a number of chronic diseases including dia-
betes and CHD (38). Taken together, these findings suggest a
robust relation between measures of carbohydrate quality and
CHD.
A number of potential mechanisms explain how carbohydrate
quality measures, such as the carbohydrate-to–cereal fiber ratio
and the starch-to–cereal fiber ratio, are associated with CHD risk.
First, low ratios are consistent with a diet rich in fiber and whole
grains. Such diets have been shown to improve postprandial
glucose and insulin responses, enhance satiety, and reduce over-
all energy intake (39, 40). In related work, data from the Multi-
Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) study showed that di-
ets rich in whole grains were inversely associated with obesity,
insulin resistance, inflammatory markers, elevated fasting glu-
cose, and incident diabetes (41). Conversely, when diets are lack-
ing adequate fiber and whole grains, there is an increased risk
for diabetes. Recent work involving >70,000 participants in the
NHS found that diets high in refined grains (defined by high
carbohydrate-to–cereal fiber and starch to cereal fiber ratios) were
associated with a 28% and 39% increased risk of incident type
2 diabetes mellitus, respectively (18). Cardiometabolic risk re-
lated to a diet high in refined grains has also been associated with
other potent risk factors for CHD, including hypertension, dys-
lipidemia, and impaired fibrinolysis (42–44).
Our study has a number of strengths including the large sample
size with a large number of CHD events, long follow-up period
of ≤28 y, and a minimal number of participants with missing ex-
posure data. Furthermore, in order to best represent long-term di-
etary patterns, cumulative averages from all available FFQs were
used as the exposure variables. Finally, to reduce the risk of bias
due to the presence of newly diagnosed chronic disease states, di-
etary records were not updated during the follow-up period after
such a disease state was diagnosed. Our study also has a few im-
portant limitations. First, study participants were predominantly
Caucasian health professionals, which may limit the generaliz-
ability of our findings to other more ethnically and socioeconom-
ically diverse populations. Second, exposure variables were mea-
sured using an FFQ. Although previously validated (20), FFQs
are subject to misclassification. Finally, as is the case with all
prospective cohort studies, there is the chance for bias due to
residual and/or unmeasured confounding factors.
The results of our study confirm the consistent associa-
tion between dietary fiber, especially cereal fiber and risk for
CHD. Furthermore, although the positive association between the
carbohydrate-to–cereal fiber ratio and the starch-to–cereal fiber
ratio and risk of CHD was mainly driven by cereal fiber, the ra-
tios were predictive of risk of type 2 diabetes in a previous study
and warrant further research in relation to health endpoints in di-
verse populations. Given these associations, future work should
focus on how these global measures of carbohydrate quality are
related to the primary and secondary prevention of CHD.
We thank all the participants in the Nurses’Health Study for their tremen-
dous contributions.
