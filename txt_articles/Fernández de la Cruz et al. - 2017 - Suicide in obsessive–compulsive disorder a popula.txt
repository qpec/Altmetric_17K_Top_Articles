The risk of death by suicide in individuals with obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) is largely unknown. Previous studies have
been small and methodologically flawed. We analyzed data from the Swedish national registers to estimate the risk of suicide in
OCD and identify the risk and protective factors associated with suicidal behavior in this group. We used a matched case–cohort
design to estimate the risk of deaths by suicide and attempted suicide in individuals diagnosed with OCD, compared with matched
general population controls (1:10). Cox regression models were used to study predictors of suicidal behavior. We identified 36 788
OCD patients in the Swedish National Patient Register between 1969 and 2013. Of these, 545 had died by suicide and 4297 had
attempted suicide. In unadjusted models, individuals with OCD had an increased risk of both dying by suicide (odds ratio
(OR) = 9.83 (95% confidence interval (CI), 8.72–11.08)) and attempting suicide (OR = 5.45 (95% CI, 5.24–5.67)), compared with
matched controls. After adjusting for psychiatric comorbidities, the risk was reduced but remained substantial for both death by
suicide and attempted suicide. Within the OCD cohort, a previous suicide attempt was the strongest predictor of death by suicide.
Having a comorbid personality or substance use disorder also increased the risk of suicide. Being a woman, higher parental
education and having a comorbid anxiety disorder were protective factors. We conclude that patients with OCD are at a substantial
risk of suicide. Importantly, this risk remains substantial after adjusting for psychiatric comorbidities. Suicide risk should be carefully
monitored in patients with OCD.

INTRODUCTION
Suicide is a major public health problem with an estimated global
burden of more than 800 000 deaths per year, accounting for 1.4%
of all deaths worldwide.1 Individuals with mental health condi-
tions are at high risk of dying by suicide and attempting suicide,2,3
with about 90% of people who kill themselves considered to suffer
from a psychiatric disorder.4 Surprisingly, little attention has been
paid to the risk of suicide in obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD),
one of the most common and disabling mental disorders.5 OCD
has a lifetime prevalence of approximately 2% in the general
population,5 often runs a chronic course and is associated with
substantial reductions in quality of life.6 OCD is generally
accompanied by other psychiatric disorders, with comorbidity
rates as high as 90%,5 that further contribute to the burden
associated with the disorder.7
Historically, patients with OCD have been considered to be at a
relatively
low
risk
of
dying
by
suicide.8–10
However,
this
appreciation derives from a small number of modestly sized
studies, generally conducted in specialist clinics, which were not
only underpowered to study deaths by suicide (a relatively rare
event) but also subject to potential selection biases (patients with
OCD seen in specialist clinics are typically more severe).11,12 In
addition, these studies have typically included short follow-up
times,12 probably insufficient to detect the true risk of suicide in
OCD. A meta-analysis established the suicide risk in OCD to be 10
times higher than expected, but these conclusions were based on
two single studies including a combined total of three deaths by
suicide.13 A recent epidemiological study concluded that indivi-
duals with OCD (n = 10 155) were three times more likely to die by
suicide than population controls.14 However, this figure was also
based on a small number of suicide cases (44 cases of unnatural
causes of death were reported, including deaths by suicide,
accidents and homicides). Therefore, more accurate and unbiased
estimates of death by suicide in OCD are needed.
Compared with deaths by suicide, suicide attempts have been
more extensively studied in the OCD literature. In a large
epidemiological study in the United States (n = 18 571), Hollander
and colleagues15 reported that OCD sufferers without psychiatric
comorbidity (n = 140) had a significantly higher rate of self-
reported lifetime suicide attempts compared with individuals
without a mental disorder (3.6 vs 0.9%, odds ratio (OR) = 3.2), while
OCD cases with psychiatric comorbidity (n = 266) had an even
higher rate of lifetime suicide attempts than individuals with other
mental disorders (15.0 vs 7.0%; OR = 2.2). Torres and colleagues16
identified 114 individuals with OCD in the British National
Psychiatric Morbidity Survey of 2000—comprising 8580 indivi-
duals—and observed that 25% of OCD cases had self-reported at
least one previous suicide attempt. In addition, studies conducted
in specialist clinics have reported rates of suicide attempts ranging
from 3 to 27%.12,17–19 However, as concluded in a recent meta-
analysis, the methodological quality of the previous literature on
suicidal behavior in OCD has generally been poor.20
In an attempt to provide more accurate estimates of risks of
suicide and attempted suicide in OCD, we analyzed data from the

 Swedish national registers, including more than 36 000 individuals
diagnosed with OCD over four decades (1969–2013). Specifically,
we aimed to (i) determine the risk of deaths by suicide and
attempted suicide in individuals with OCD, compared with
population-matched controls; (ii) determine whether OCD itself
is associated with suicidal behavior, after adjusting for comorbid
psychiatric disorders; and (iii) identify predictors associated with
suicidal behavior among individuals with OCD.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
The study was approved by the Regional Ethical Review Board in
Stockholm
(reference number 2013/862-31/5). The requirement for
informed consent was waived because the study was register-based and
the included individuals were not identifiable at any time.
National registers
Using the unique national identification numbers assigned to Swedish
citizens as key,21 we linked several Swedish nationwide population-based
registers. The National Patient Register (NPR) includes diagnostic informa-
tion on individuals admitted to a Swedish hospital since 1969. From 2001,
the NPR also contains data on outpatient consultations in specialized
care.22 Diagnoses are based on the International Classification of Diseases
(ICD), eighth (ICD-8; 1969–1986), ninth (ICD-9; 1987–1996) and tenth
(ICD-10; 1997–2013) revisions. The Cause of Death Register contains a
record of all deaths in Sweden since 1952, with compulsory reporting
nationwide. Each record contains the date of death and codes for causes of
death, also in accordance to ICD codes. The Cause of Death Register covers
more than 99% of all deaths in Swedish residents, including those
occurring abroad, resulting in minimal loss of information.23 Demographic
and socioeconomic data were derived from the Swedish Register of Total
Population with supplementy data from the Education Register.
Variables
Patients with an OCD diagnosis were identified from the NPR (ICD-8 code
300.3; ICD-9 code 300D; ICD-10 code F42) by having at least one record of
inpatient or outpatient care between 1 January 1969 and 31 December
2013. Patients with at least one inpatient record were classed as inpatients,
while the remaining were classed as outpatients. ICD codes for OCD have
been previously validated by comparing registered diagnoses and
information in clinical records. ICD-10 codes have excellent inter-rater
reliability and validity, with a positive predictive value of 0.91–0.96. ICD-8
and ICD-9 codes for OCD have moderate validity (positive predictive
value = 0.55 and 0.64, respectively).24 Information on other lifetime
psychiatric disorders was also obtained from the NPR. Comorbid diagnoses
were grouped into affective disorders, psychotic disorders, personality
disorders, substance use disorders, anxiety disorders and ‘other disorders’
(including reaction to severe stress, adjustment, dissociative, somatoform
and other neurotic disorders; for specific ICD codes, see Supplementary
Material).
Suicidal behavior was defined as a record of death by suicide (identified
through the Cause of Death Register) or lifetime suicide attempts (hospital
admissions or outpatient consultations in specialized care due to suicide
attempts identified through the NPR). To avoid underestimation of suicidal
behavior rates and be consistent with recent suicide research,25,26 we
included both certain and undetermined causes in our definitions of
death by suicide and attempted suicide as follows: ‘suicide and self-
inflicted injury’ (ICD-8 and ICD-9 codes E950-E959); ‘intentional self-harm’
(ICD-10 codes X60-X84); ‘injury undetermined whether accidental or
purposely inflicted’ (ICD-8 and ICD-9 codes E980-E989) and ‘events of
undetermined intent’ (ICD-10 codes Y10-Y34). Methods of death by suicide
and attempted suicide were classified according to ICD grouping codes
(for specific ICD codes, see Supplementary Material). Further, methods
were classified into self-poisoning (poisoning) and self-injury (remaining
methods).27
Parental education level was used as a proxy for the participants’
socioeconomic status.28 The highest attained education among the
parents of patients and controls was categorized into three groups:
elementary education (⩽9 years), secondary education (10–12 years) and
higher education (412 years).
Statistical analyses
We used a matched case–cohort design to estimate the risk of suicidal
behavior in individuals diagnosed with OCD, compared with general
population controls. Each OCD patient in the cohort was matched on sex,
birth year and county of residence at the time of the first OCD diagnosis
with up to 10 general population controls from the Swedish Register of
Total Population who had never been diagnosed with OCD by the date of
the corresponding cohort member’s date of first diagnosis.
Conditional logistic regression analyses were used to estimate the
association between OCD and suicidal behavior and other variables of
interest expressed as OR with 95% confidence intervals (CI). In adjusted
models, we controlled for parental level of education and different groups
of psychiatric comorbidities. For the main outcomes, analyses were
stratified by sex, setting (inpatients and outpatients) and ICD version of the
first OCD diagnosis received. The specific methods of death by suicide and
attempted suicide were also described and frequencies in both cohorts
were compared using OR and the corresponding 95% CI.
To study predictors of suicidal behavior, individuals in the OCD cohort
were followed-up from the date of the first diagnosis of OCD to the date of
the outcomes of interest (death by suicide and attempted suicide), death
other than suicide, emigration or end of follow-up (31 December 2013),
whichever came first. Cox regression models were used to compute hazard
ratios with 95% CI, taking time at risk into account.
All analyses were performed using SAS, version 9.4 for Windows (SAS
Institute, Cary, NC, USA).
RESULTS
Descriptive variables
We identified a total of 36 788 cases (20 791 women; 56.52%)
diagnosed with OCD in the NPR during the 44-year study period.
Of those, 87.00% (n = 32 005) were diagnosed with an ICD-10
code. As expected, individuals with OCD had higher rates of other
lifetime psychiatric disorders, compared with the general popula-
tion (Table 1). A total of 76.40% (n = 26 634) of the OCD cases had
at least one comorbid psychiatric disorder, as compared with
12.09% (n = 44 486) of the control group (OR = 22.15 (95% CI,
21.53–22.79)). Parents of individuals with OCD and parents of
control cases had a similar level of education (Table 1).
Risk of death by suicide and attempted suicide
In the 44-year study period, 545 individuals (1.48%) from the OCD
cohort had died by suicide, and 4297 (11.68%) had attempted
suicide at least once. Individuals with OCD had an increased risk of
both dying by suicide and attempting suicide compared with the
matched controls (OR = 9.83 (95% CI, 8.72–11.08) and OR = 5.45
(95% CI, 5.24–5.67), respectively; Table 1). When adjusting for
psychiatric comorbidities, the risk of dying by suicide was slightly
reduced—especially when substance use disorders and affective
disorders were taken into account—but remained substantial (ORs
ranging from 7.49 to 9.23). On the other hand, the risk of
attempted suicide was substantially reduced, although not
eliminated, when adjusting for comorbidities (ORs ranging from
1.90 to 4.21). Adjusting for parental level of education did not
change the risk estimates (Table 2).
Two hundred and thirty-seven (43.49%) of the individuals
from the OCD cohort who died by suicide did not have any other
recorded psychiatric comorbidity. Conversely, only 4.14% (n = 178)
of the OCD cases who had attempted suicide did not have any
other registered psychiatric diagnosis. The percentage of recorded
comorbidities in those individuals who died by suicide or
attempted suicide in the OCD cohort is graphically shown in
Figure 1. The risk of dying by suicide for those OCD cases without
any recorded comorbidities (n = 10 154) was similar to that for
the full cohort (OR = 13.18 (95% CI, 10.76–16.16)), but their risk for
attempted suicide was significantly lower (OR = 1.59 (95% CI,
1.36–1.87)).

 Risk in women and men with OCD
Both women and men with OCD had a significantly higher risk of
dying by suicide than women and men from the general
population. However, this risk was more pronounced for women
than men with OCD (ORs = 12.25 vs 8.44, respectively; P-value for
χ2 = 0.002). This was also the case when considering suicide
attempts; women in the OCD cohort had a higher risk as
compared with men (ORs = 5.99 vs 4.67, respectively; P-value for
χ2o0.0001); this difference was driven by women being more
likely to attempt suicide than men in the OCD group, but not in
the general population cohort (Table 1). Patients with OCD
were approximately 3 years younger than controls at the time of
suicide (42.55 vs 45.45 years; P-value for t-test = 0.003). On the
other hand, patients with OCD were approximately 2 years older
than controls when they first attempted suicide (30.31 vs 28.56
years; P-value for t-testo0.001) (Table 1). Individuals with OCD
were more likely to have repeated attempts (more than two) than
their matched controls (30.30% vs 16.03%, respectively; OR = 2.07)
(Table 1).
Additional subgroup analyses
As expected, the risk of dying by suicide and attempting suicide
in those patients who had been admitted as inpatients at least
once (OR = 12.05 (95% CI, 10.46–13.88) and OR = 10.73 (95% CI,
10.03–11.49), respectively) was significantly higher than in the
outpatient group (OR = 5.88 (95% CI, 4.65–7.44) and OR = 3.90
(95% CI, 3.71–4.10), respectively). The risk of death by suicide was
similar across ICD versions (OR ICD-8 = 10.44 (95% CI, 8.60–12.67);
OR ICD-9 = 9.34 (95% CI, 6.57–13.27); OR ICD-10 = 9.61 (95% CI,
8.12–11.38)). However, the risk of attempted suicide was higher for
those individuals who had received an OCD diagnosis based on
ICD-9 codes (ORs = 7.60 (95% CI, 6.23–9.26)), compared with those
receiving an ICD-8 or an ICD-10 code (OR = 4.14 (95% CI, 3.14–5.02)
and OR = 5.45 (95% CI, 5.23–5.67), respectively).
Methods of suicide and attempted suicide
Among those who died by suicide, the specific methods used
differed between the OCD and the control cohorts (Table 3).
Although self-poisoning was the most common method of suicide

 in both groups, it was significantly more frequent in the OCD
cohort (OR = 4.00 (95% CI, 1.13–4.17)), while self-injury methods
were more frequent in the control cohort (OR = 0.25 (95% CI,
0.07–0.89)). Similarly, the most common method among those
attempting suicide in both groups was also self-poisoning which,
again, was significantly more frequent in the OCD cohort
(OR = 2.33 (95% CI, 1.90–2.87)).
Methods of suicide and attempted suicide were generally
similar across genders. However, for the attempts, the magnitude
of the effects was different in women and men. For example, self-
poisoning was more frequent in OCD vs controls in both genders,
but this was more prominent in men (OR = 3.49 (95% CI,
2.46–4.96)) than it was in women (OR = 1.81 (95% CI, 1.39–2.35)).
On the other hand, self-injury was more frequent in both men and
women controls, but this difference was only significant for the
men (OR = 0.50 (95% CI, 0.37–0.68); Supplementary Table S1).
Predictors of death by suicide and suicide attempts
Among the patients in the OCD cohort, 179 of the 545 (32.84%)
who died by suicide had record of a previous suicide attempt.
A previous suicide attempt was the variable that most increased
the risk of subsequent death by suicide (hazard ratio = 4.68 (95%
CI, 3.65–6.01)). In addition, a comorbid substance use disorder
or a personality disorder also increased the risk of death by suicide
(hazard ratios = 1.82 and 1.40, respectively). Higher parental
education, being a woman, a comorbid anxiety disorder or a
comorbid disorder from the ‘other disorders’ category were
protective factors. Regarding attempted suicides, all examined
predictors were found to increase the risk, particularly the
comorbidity with substance use disorders (Table 4).
DISCUSSION
In this large register-based study of individuals diagnosed with
OCD in Sweden over four decades, we found that the disorder was
strongly associated with suicidal behavior. The risk of dying by
suicide was approximately ten times higher, and the risk of
attempted suicide five times higher, than that of the general
population. This risk remained substantial after adjusting for
different groups of psychiatric comorbidities that are already
known to be associated with suicide. In fact, 43% of the individuals
from the OCD cohort who died by suicide did not have any other
recorded psychiatric comorbidity. Thus, OCD is associated with an
increased risk of death by suicide in its own right, a risk that was

 previously unappreciated. Our estimates place OCD at a compar-
able suicide risk with other mental disorders like schizophrenia,29
bipolar disorder30 and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder,28
and at higher risk than posttraumatic stress disorder31 or alcohol
use disorders.32
Importantly, the risk of attempted suicide was substantially
reduced, though not entirely eliminated, when the models
adjusted for psychiatric comorbidity. This contrasts with deaths
by suicide, which were largely independent from such comor-
bidity. Clinicians should be aware that psychiatric comorbidity is
not necessarily a reliable indicator of the actual risk of death by
suicide in this group. We did find, however, that comorbid perso-
nality and substance use disorders increased the risk of suicide by
40–82%, which is consistent with the high risk associated with
these disorders in their own right.2 These particular comorbidities
require special attention and monitoring in OCD. In the case of
suicide attempts, all psychiatric comorbidities increased the risk,
especially substance use and affective disorders. Given the high
rates of comorbidity in OCD,5 this becomes particularly relevant.
Suicidal thoughts should be explored and frequently monitored in
all OCD patients, particularly if comorbidities are present and in
patients with previous attempts. A higher level of education
was a protective factor for death by suicide but appeared to
be a risk factor for attempting suicide. It should be borne in
mind that suicide attempts are mostly based on hospitalization
and attendance to specialty clinics. Thus, higher education may
actually reflect greater likelihood of seeking out services rather
than an actual higher risk of suicidal behavior.
Women with OCD were at higher risk of suicide compared with
men with OCD, relative to women and men from the general
population, respectively. This suggests that women patients with
OCD may require extra monitoring and follow-up.
Overall, the methods of suicide in the OCD cohort were similar
to those in the general population, with self-poisoning—a method
sometimes
classified
as
non-violent33—being
the
preferred
method in both groups. However, the individuals in the OCD
cohort, especially the men, used this method more frequently
than the population controls. This is in line with a previous
investigation looking at 351 consecutive suicides in an urban
community34 where anxiety disorders were also associated with
non-violent methods, including overdose. As approximately 85%
of the patients with OCD in the Swedish national registers are on
psychotropic medication,35 we speculate that the more frequent

Suicide in obsessive–compulsive disorder

 use of self-poisoning in the OCD cohort may be related to the
ready availability of psychotropic medication in this group. Patients
with OCD were less likely to use violent methods of suicide, which
may be consistent with the particular personality profile of this
patient group, typically described as ‘harm avoidant’.36
In line with the available suicide literature,2 a previous suicide
attempt was the main predictor of dying by suicide in the OCD
cohort, increasing the risk approximately fivefold. Patients with
OCD were also more likely to attempt suicide at multiple occasions
(more than two), compared with the population controls. This may
provide clinicians with an opportunity to implement risk manage-
ment strategies to prevent further attempts and potential deaths.
The identification and recognition of risk factors for suicidal
behavior in OCD should guide the development of empirically
based preventive and intervention strategies aimed at reducing
suicide rates in this group. Suicide-prevention strategies, such as
restricting access to means (for example, lethal drugs), encoura-
ging self-help, increasing the likelihood of intervention by a third
party or education of physicians, for example, have shown to be
helpful in reducing the number of suicides.37,38 These strategies
should be tailored to the needs of patients with OCD and
implemented in their care plan.
Strengths of this study include the use of a very large
population-based cohort of patients with OCD and a four-
decade study period long enough to capture the outcomes of
interest. There were, however, some limitations. First, because
suicide is a sensitive issue, it is likely that it is underreported.
Suicide may be misclassified as an accident or another cause of
death, especially in those who have not been previously
diagnosed with a mental disorder. However, in line with previous
studies,25,39 we tried to minimize this issue by including also the
events diagnosed as undetermined causes. Second, whereas
ICD-10 codes for OCD have excellent validity and reliability,
ICD-8 and ICD-9 codes are somewhat less reliable.24 However, only
13% of our patient cohort were diagnosed using these older
codes, and stratified analysis showed that the results were largely
comparable across the different ICD editions. Third, because
outpatient data were only introduced in the Swedish registers in
2001, during years 1969–2000 the cohort only included individuals
whose attempted suicide led to inpatient care, potentially leaving
out attempts of lower lethality. In addition, patients with OCD
included in the NPR register may not be representative of all OCD
cases in the population as the register is biased towards inpatients
and only includes specialist care visits and not patients seen in
general practitioner clinics. In the same way, the NPR does not
include patients diagnosed by professionals other than physicians.
These limitations also apply to the identification of the comorbid
psychiatric conditions. Finally, despite the large dataset, some
of the specific methods of suicidal behavior were rare. Thus,
these comparisons based on small numbers should be cautiously
interpreted.
CONCLUSIONS
OCD is associated with a substantial risk of suicide, which is largely
independent from psychiatric comorbidities. Clinicians should be
aware that many patients with OCD may successfully complete
suicide even in the absence of other psychiatric comorbidities.
A previous suicide attempt was the strongest predictor of dying
by suicide in individuals with OCD. Poisoning was the most
frequent method used, perhaps because of the availability of
prescription drugs. OCD should be added to the list of psychiatric
disorders that are known to increase the risk of suicide in their
own right. Suicide risk needs to be carefully monitored in these
patients, particularly in those who have previously attempted
suicide. Our results represent a first step towards the design of
preventive and interventional strategies aiming to prevent fatal
consequences in this group.
