Abstract
Problem: Priority health-risk behaviors contribute to the leading causes of morbidity and mortality among youth and adults. 
Population-based data on these behaviors at the national, state, and local levels can help monitor the effectiveness of public health 
interventions designed to protect and promote the health of youth nationwide.
Reporting Period Covered: September 2014–December 2015.
Description of the System: The Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBSS) monitors six categories of priority health behaviors 
among youth and young adults: 1) behaviors that contribute to unintentional injuries and violence; 2) tobacco use; 3) alcohol and 
other drug use; 4) sexual behaviors related to unintended pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections (STIs), including human 
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection; 5) unhealthy dietary behaviors; and 6) physical inactivity. In addition, YRBSS monitors 
the prevalence of obesity and asthma and other priority health behaviors. YRBSS includes a national school-based Youth Risk 
Behavior Survey (YRBS) conducted by CDC and state and large urban school district school-based YRBSs conducted by state and 
local education and health agencies. This report summarizes results for 118 health behaviors plus obesity, overweight, and asthma 
from the 2015 national survey, 37 state surveys, and 19 large urban school district surveys conducted among students in grades 9–12.
Results: Results from the 2015 national YRBS indicated that many high school students are engaged in priority health-risk behaviors 
associated with the leading causes of death among persons aged 10–24 years in the United States. During the 30 days before the survey, 
41.5% of high school students nationwide among the 61.3% who drove a car or other vehicle during the 30 days before the survey 
had texted or e-mailed while driving, 32.8% had drunk alcohol, and 21.7% had used marijuana. During the 12 months before the 
survey, 15.5% had been electronically bullied, 20.2% had been bullied on school property, and 8.6% had attempted suicide. Many 
high school students are engaged in sexual risk behaviors related to unintended pregnancies and STIs, including HIV infection. 
Nationwide, 41.2% of students had ever had sexual intercourse, 30.1% had had sexual intercourse during the 3 months before the 
survey (i.e., currently sexually active), and 11.5% had had sexual intercourse with four or more persons during their life. Among 
currently sexually active students, 56.9% had used a condom during their last sexual intercourse. Results from the 2015 national 
YRBS also indicated many high school students are engaged in behaviors associated with chronic diseases, such as cardiovascular 
disease, cancer, and diabetes. During the 30 days before the survey, 10.8% of high school students had smoked cigarettes and 7.3% 
had used smokeless tobacco. During the 7 days before the survey, 5.2% of high school students had not eaten fruit or drunk 100% 
fruit juices and 6.7% had not eaten vegetables. More than one third (41.7%) had played video or computer games or used a computer 
for something that was not school work for 3 or more hours per day on an average school day and 14.3% had not participated in at 
least 60 minutes of any kind of physical activity that increased their heart rate and made them breathe hard on at least 1 day during 
the 7 days before the survey. Further, 13.9% had obesity and 16.0% were overweight.
Interpretation: Many high school students engage in behaviors that place them at risk for the leading causes of morbidity and 
mortality. The prevalence of most health behaviors varies by sex, race/ethnicity, and grade and across states and large urban school 
districts. Long-term temporal changes also have occurred. Since the earliest year of data collection, the prevalence of most health-
risk behaviors has decreased (e.g., riding with a driver who had been drinking alcohol, physical fighting, current cigarette use, 
current alcohol use, and current sexual activity), but the prevalence of other behaviors and health outcomes has not changed (e.g., 
suicide attempts treated by a doctor or nurse, smokeless tobacco use, having ever used marijuana, and attending physical education 
classes) or has increased (e.g., having not gone to school because 
of safety concerns, obesity, overweight, not eating vegetables, and 
not drinking milk). Monitoring emerging risk behaviors (e.g., 
texting and driving, bullying, and electronic vapor product use) 
is important to understand how they might vary over time.

Public Health Action: YRBSS data are used widely to compare the prevalence of health behaviors among subpopulations of 
students; assess trends in health behaviors over time; monitor progress toward achieving 21 national health objectives for Healthy 
People 2020 and one of the 26 leading health indicators; provide comparable state and large urban school district data; and help 
develop and evaluate school and community policies, programs, and practices designed to decrease health-risk behaviors and 
improve health outcomes among youth.
Introduction
In the United States in 2014, 71% of all deaths among persons 
aged 10–24 years resulted from four causes: motor vehicle 
crashes (23%), other unintentional injuries (17%), homicide 
(14%), and suicide (17%) (1). Among persons aged 15–19 years, 
273,105 births (2); 451,208 cases of chlamydia, gonorrhea, and 
syphilis (3); and 1,828 diagnoses of human immunodeficiency 
virus (HIV) (4) are reported annually. Among persons aged 
≥25 years, 54% of all deaths in the United States result from 
cardiovascular disease (31%) and cancer (23%) (1). These leading 
causes of mortality, morbidity, and social problems among 
youth and adults in the United States are related to six categories 
of priority health behaviors: 1) behaviors that contribute to 
unintentional injuries and violence; 2) tobacco use; 3) alcohol 
and other drug use; 4) sexual behaviors related to unintended 
pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections (STIs), including 
HIV infection; 5) unhealthy dietary behaviors; and 6) physical 
inactivity. These behaviors frequently are interrelated and are 
established during childhood and adolescence and extend into 
adulthood. To monitor priority health behaviors in each of these 
six categories, the prevalence of obesity, overweight and asthma, 
and other priority health behaviors among youth and young 
adults, CDC developed the Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance 
System (YRBSS) (5). YRBSS includes school-based national, 
state, and large urban school district Youth Risk Behavior Surveys 
(YRBS) conducted among representative samples of students in 
grades 9–12. National, state, and large urban school district surveys 
have been conducted biennially since 1991 (Table 1). Additional 
information about YRBSS is available at http://www.cdc.gov/
healthyyouth/data/yrbs/index.htm.
This report summarizes results for 118 health behaviors plus 
obesity, overweight, and asthma from the 2015 national YRBS 
and overall trends in health behaviors during 1991–2015. Data 
from the 37 state and 19 large urban school district surveys with 
weighted data for the 2015 YRBSS cycle (Figure) also are included 
in this report. Results from 10 state and two large urban school 
district surveys with unweighted data are not included. Among 
those with weighted data for 2015, three state and one large 
urban school district surveys were conducted during fall 2014; the 
national survey, 29 state, and 16 large urban school district surveys 
were conducted during spring 2015; and five state and two large 
urban school district surveys were conducted during fall 2015.
Methods
Detailed information about the methodology of the national, 
state, and large urban school district YRBSs has been described 
elsewhere (5).
Sampling
National Youth Risk Behavior Survey
The sampling frame for the 2015 national YRBS consisted of 
all regular public* and private† schools with students in at least 
one of grades 9–12 in the 50 states and the District of Columbia. 
The sampling frame was based on the Market Data Retrieval 
(MDR) database (6), which includes information on both public 
and private schools and the most recent data from the Common 
Core of Data from the National Center for Education Statistics 
(7). A three-stage cluster sample design produced a nationally 
representative sample of students in grades 9–12 who attend public 
and private schools. The first-stage sampling frame consisted of 
1,259 primary sampling units (PSUs), consisting of counties, 
subareas of large counties, or groups of smaller, adjacent counties. 
The 1,259 PSUs were categorized into 16 strata according to their 
metropolitan statistical area (MSA) status (e.g., urban city) and 
the percentages of black and Hispanic students in the PSUs. From 
the 1,259 PSUs, 54 were sampled with probability proportional 
to overall school enrollment size for the PSU.
In the second stage of sampling, 180 schools with any of 
grades 9–12 were sampled with probability proportional to 
school enrollment size from within the 54 PSUs. The third 
stage of sampling consisted of random sampling in each of 
grades 9–12, one or two classrooms from either a required 
subject (e.g., English or social studies) or a required period 
(e.g., homeroom or second period). All students in sampled 
classes were eligible to participate. Schools, classes, and 
students that refused to participate were not replaced.
To enable a separate analysis of data for black and Hispanic 
students, two classes per grade, rather than one, were sampled 
* Might include charter schools and public alternative, special education, or 
vocational schools.
† Might include religious and other private schools, but does not include private 
alternative, special education, or vocational schools.

in schools with a high minority enrollment. Before the 
2013 national YRBS, three strategies were used to oversample 
black and Hispanic students: 1) larger sampling rates were 
used to select PSUs that were in high-black and high-Hispanic 
strata; 2) a modified measure of size was used to increase the 
probability of sampling schools with a disproportionately 
high minority enrollment; and 3) two classes per grade, rather 
than one, were sampled in schools with a high minority 
enrollment. Because of increases in the proportions of black 
and Hispanic students in the population, only selection of 
two classes per grade was needed in 2013 and 2015 to balance 
the precision needed for subgroup estimates with minimum 
variance for overall estimates.
State and Large Urban School District 
Youth Risk Behaviors
In 2015, a two-stage cluster sample design was used to 
produce a representative sample of public§ school students 
in grades 9–12 in 36 states and 19 large urban school 
districts and of public and private¶ school students in grades 
9–12 in one state (South Dakota). In the first sampling 
stage, schools with any of grades 9–12 were sampled with 
probability proportional to school enrollment size in 
34 states and three large urban school districts; all schools 
with any of grades 9–12 were invited to participate in three 
states and 16 large urban school districts. In the second 
sampling stage, intact classes from either a required subject 
(e.g., English or social studies) or a required period (e.g., 
homeroom or second period) were sampled randomly in 
36 states and 18 large urban school districts, and all students 
in the sampled classes were eligible to participate. In one 
state and one large urban school district, all students in 
sampled schools were eligible to participate.
Data Collection Procedures and 
Questionnaires
Survey procedures for the national, state, and large urban 
school district surveys were designed to protect students’ privacy 
by allowing for anonymous and voluntary participation. Before 
survey administration, local parental permission procedures 
were followed. Students completed the self-administered 
questionnaire during one class period and recorded their 
responses directly on a computer-scannable booklet or answer 
sheet. CDC’s Institutional Review Board approved the protocol 
for the national YRBS.
The 2015 YRBS standard questionnaire contained 
89 questions. This questionnaire was used as the starting point 
for the state and large urban school district questionnaires. 
States and large urban school districts could add and/or delete 
questions from the standard questionnaire. Only one state and 
three large urban school districts included in this report used 
the 2015 YRBS standard questionnaire without modifications. 
This report presents state and large urban school district results 
only from selected questions on the 2015 standard questionnaire.
The 2015 national YRBS questionnaire 
contained 99 questions, including 
all 89 questions on the standard 
questionnaire. This report presents 
national results (along with state and 
large urban school district results) for 
selected questions on the 2015 standard 
questionnaire plus national only results 
from eight additional questions measuring 
usual method of marijuana use, ever use 
of hallucinogenic drugs, consumption 
of sports drinks, consumption of water, 
muscle strengthening exercises, indoor 
tanning device use, having had a sunburn, 
and avoidance of foods because eating 
the food could cause an allergic reaction.

three questions assessing height, weight, and asthma, all 
the remaining questions on the standard questionnaire and 
the national questionnaire measured behaviors practiced or 
experienced by the student (referred to as “behaviors”). Skip 
patterns, which occur when a particular response to one 
question indicates to the respondents that they should not 
answer one or more subsequent questions, were not included 
in any YRBS questionnaire to protect students’ privacy by 
ensuring all students took about the same amount of time 
to complete the questionnaire. All questions (except for two 
questions assessing height and weight and the race question) 
were multiple choice with a maximum of eight mutually 
exclusive response options and only one possible answer per 
respondent. Information about the reliability of the standard 
questionnaire has been published elsewhere (8). The wording 
of each question, including recall periods, response options, 
and operational definitions are available in the 2015 standard 
and national YRBS questionnaires at http://www.cdc.gov/
healthyyouth/data/yrbs/index.htm. 
Results from two new standard questions measuring sexual 
minority status (i.e., sexual identity and sex of sexual contacts) 
used by 25 states and 19 large urban school districts and included 
on the national questionnaire are not described in this report.
Data Processing Procedures and  
Response Rates
For the 2015 national YRBS, 15,713 questionnaires were 
completed in 125 public and private schools. The national data 
set was cleaned and edited for inconsistencies. Missing data 
were not statistically imputed. Among the 15,713 completed 
questionnaires, 89 failed quality control** and were excluded 
from analysis, resulting in 15,624 usable questionnaires 
(Table 2). The school response rate was 69%, the student 
response rate was 86%, and the overall response rate was 
60%†† (Table 2).
Data from each state and large urban school district survey 
were cleaned and edited for inconsistencies with the same 
procedures used for the national data set. The percentage of 
completed questionnaires that failed quality control checks and 
were excluded from analysis ranged from 0.2% to 5.3% (median: 
0.8%) across the 37 states and from 0.3% to 6.4% (median: 
1.6%) across the 19 large urban school districts. The student 
sample sizes ranged from 1,313 to 55,596 (median: 2,777) across 
the states and from 1,052 to 10,419 (median: 2,181) across 
the large urban school districts (Table 2). Among the states, 
the school response rates ranged from 70% to 100%, student 
response rates ranged from 64% to 90%, and overall response 
rates ranged from 60% to 84%. Among the large urban school 
districts, the school response rates ranged from 90% to 100%, 
student response rates ranged from 66% to 88%, and overall 
response rates ranged from 64% to 88% (Table 2).
Race/ethnicity was computed from two questions: 1) “Are 
you Hispanic or Latino?” (response options were “yes” or “no”), 
and 2) “What is your race?” (response options were “American 
Indian or Alaska Native,” “Asian,” “black or African American,” 
“Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander,” or “white”). For the 
second question, students could select more than one response 
option. For this report, students were classified as “Hispanic/ 
Latino” and are referred to as “Hispanic” if they answered “yes” 
to the first question, regardless of how they answered the second 
question. Students who answered “no” to the first question 
and selected only “black or African American” to the second 
question were classified as “black or African American” and 
are referred to as “black.” Students who answered “no” to the 
first question and selected only “white” to the second question 
were classified, and are referred to, as “white.” Race/ethnicity 
was classified as missing for students who did not answer the 
first question and for students who answered “no” to the first 
question but did not answer the second question.
Students were classified as as having obesity or being overweight 
or overweight based on their body mass index (kg/m2) (BMI), 
which was calculated from self-reported height and weight. BMI 
values were compared with sex- and age-specific reference data 
from the 2000 CDC growth charts (9). Obesity  was defined 
as a BMI of ≥95th percentile for age and sex. Overweight was 
defined as a BMI of ≥85th percentile and <95th percentile for 
age and sex. These classifications are not intended to diagnose 
obesity or overweight in individual students, but to provide 
population-level estimates of obesity and overweight.
Weighting
For the national YRBS, a weight based on student sex, 
race/ethnicity, and grade was applied to each record to 
adjust for school and student nonresponse and oversampling 
of black and Hispanic students. The overall weights were 
scaled so that the weighted count of students equals the 
total sample size, and the weighted proportions of students 
in each grade match the national population proportions. 
Therefore, weighted estimates are representative of all 
students in grades 9–12 attending public and private schools 
in the United States.

representative sample of students, appropriate documentation, 
 
** A questionnaire that fails quality control has <20 remaining responses after

students sampled).

and an overall response rate of ≥60% were weighted. A weight 
was applied to each record to adjust for school and student 
nonresponse and the distribution of students by grade, sex, and 
race/ethnicity in each jurisdiction, such that the weighted count 
of students equals the student population in each jurisdiction. 
Data from 37 states and 19 large urban school districts were 
weighted. In 36 states and all large urban school districts, 
weighted estimates are representative of all students in grades 
9–12 attending public schools in each jurisdiction. In one state 
(South Dakota), weighted estimates are representative of all 
students in grades 9–12 attending public and private schools.
Analytic Methods
Statistical analyses were conducted on weighted data 
using SAS (10) and SUDAAN (11) software to account 
for the complex sampling designs. Prevalence estimates 
and confidence intervals were computed for all variables 
and all data sets. In addition, for the national YRBS data, 
t tests were used to determine pairwise differences between 
subpopulations (12). Differences between prevalence 
estimates were considered statistically significant if the t test 
p value was <0.05 for main effects (sex, race/ethnicity, and 
grade) and for interactions (sex by race/ethnicity, sex by 
grade, race/ethnicity by sex, and grade by sex). In the results 
section, only statistically significant differences in national 
YRBS prevalence estimates are reported in the following 
order: sex, sex by race/ethnicity, sex by grade, race/ethnicity, 
race/ethnicity by sex, grade, and grade by sex.
To identify long-term temporal trends in health behaviors 
nationwide, prevalence estimates from the earliest year 
of data collection to 2015 for each variable assessed with 
identically worded questions in three or more survey years 
were examined. Logistic regression analyses were used to 
account for all available estimates; control for sex, grade, 
and racial/ ethnic changes over time; and assess long-term 
linear and quadratic trends (12). A p value associated with 
the regression coefficient that was <0.05 was considered 
statistically significant. Linear and quadratic time variables 
were treated as continuous and were coded using orthogonal 
coefficients calculated with PROC IML in SAS. Separate 
regression models were used to assess linear and quadratic 
trends for every variable. When a significant quadratic trend 
was identified, Joinpoint software (13) was used to automate 
identification of the year or “joinpoint” where the nonlinear 
(i.e., quadratic) trend changed and then regression models 
were used to identify linear trends occurring in each segment. 
Cubic and higher order trends were not assessed. A quadratic 
trend indicates a significant but nonlinear trend in prevalence 
over time. A long-term temporal change that includes a 
significant linear and quadratic trend demonstrates nonlinear 
variation (e.g., leveling off or change in direction) in addition 
to an overall increase or decrease over time.
To identify 2-year temporal changes in health behaviors 
nationwide, prevalence estimates from 2013 and 2015 
were compared using t tests for each variable assessed 
with identically worded questions in both survey years. 
Prevalence estimates were considered statistically different 
if the t test p value was <0.05.
In the results section, long-term linear and quadratic 
trends are described first followed by results from the 
t tests used to assess 2-year temporal changes. Information 
about long-term temporal trends and 2-year temporal 
changes are not available because of changes in question or 
response option wording or because the question was asked 
for the first time during 2015 for the following variables: 
usually obtained their own cigarettes by buying them on 
the Internet; ever use of electronic vapor products; current 
use of electronic vapor products; current use of cigarettes, 
cigars, smokeless tobacco, or electronic vapor products; 
usual method of marijuana use; ever use of synthetic 
marijuana; sports drink consumption; water consumption; 
had a sunburn; having seen a dentist; and avoidance of foods 
because eating the food could cause an allergic reaction.
Results
Behaviors that Contribute to 
Unintentional Injuries
Rarely or Never Wore a Bicycle Helmet
Among the 68.0% of students nationwide who had ridden 
a bicycle during the 12 months before the survey, 81.4% had 
rarely or never worn a bicycle helmet (Table 3). The prevalence 
of having rarely or never worn a bicycle helmet was higher among 
11th-grade male (85.4%) than 11th-grade female (78.5%) 
students. The prevalence of having rarely or never worn a bicycle 
helmet was higher among black (88.2%) and Hispanic (90.1%) 
than white (76.4%) students, higher among Hispanic female 
(90.3%) than white female (75.3%) students, and higher among 
black male (91.6%) and Hispanic male (90.0%) than white male 
(77.5%) students. The prevalence of having rarely or never worn 
a bicycle helmet was higher among 12th-grade (83.5%) than 
9th-grade (79.4%) students, higher among 11th-grade male 
(85.4%) and 12th-grade male (84.9%) than 9th-grade male 
(80.2%) students, and higher among 11th-grade male (85.4%) 
than 10th-grade male (80.4%) students.
During 1991–2015, a significant linear decrease occurred 
overall in the prevalence of having rarely or never worn a bicycle

helmet (96.2%–81.4%). A significant quadratic trend also was 
identified. The prevalence of having rarely or never worn a 
bicycle helmet decreased during 1991–2001 (96.2%–84.7%) 
and then did not change significantly during 2001–2015 
(84.7%–81.4%). The prevalence of having never or rarely worn 
a bicycle helmet decreased significantly from 2013 (87.9%) 
to 2015 (81.4%).
Across 28 states, the prevalence of having rarely or never 
worn a bicycle helmet ranged from 53.0% to 94.1% (median: 
84.6%) (Table 4). Across 16 large urban school districts, the 
prevalence ranged from 55.1% to 95.6% (median: 87.3%).
Rarely or Never Wore a Seat Belt
Nationwide, 6.1% of students rarely or never wore a seat 
belt when riding in a car driven by someone else (Table 3). 
The prevalence of having rarely or never worn a seat belt was

During 1991–2015, a significant linear decrease occurred 
overall in the prevalence of having ridden with a driver who 
had been drinking alcohol (39.9%–20.0%). A significant 
quadratic trend also was identified. The prevalence of having 
ridden with a driver who had been drinking alcohol decreased

Drove When Drinking Alcohol
Among the 61.4% of students nationwide who drove a car or 
other vehicle during the 30 days before the survey,§§ 7.8% had 
driven a car or other vehicle one or more times when they had 
been drinking alcohol during the 30 days before the survey 
(Table 5). The prevalence of having driven a car or other vehicle 
when they had been drinking alcohol was higher among male 
(9.5%) than female (6.0%) students, higher among white 
male (9.4%) than white female (5.4%) students, and higher 
among 10th-grade male (8.2%) than 10th-grade female

female (8.0%) than 10th-grade female (2.2%) students; and 
higher among 12th-grade male (11.7%) than 9th-grade male 
(5.7%) students.
Because of changes in response options starting in 2013, 
long-term temporal trends are not available for the prevalence 
of having driven a car or other vehicle when they had been 
drinking. The prevalence of having driven a car or other vehicle 
when they had been drinking alcohol decreased significantly 
from 2013 (10.0%) to 2015 (7.8%).
Across 35 states, the prevalence of having driven a car or other 
vehicle when they had been drinking alcohol among students who 
drove a car or other vehicle during the 30 days before the survey 
ranged from 4.3% to 10.9% (median: 7.1%) (Table 6). Across 
18 large urban school districts, the prevalence ranged from 4.4% 
to 9.7% (median: 7.0%).
 
§§ The prevalence of driving a car or other vehicle during the 30 days before the survey 
varies slightly for driving when drinking alcohol and texting or e-mailing while 
driving because of differences in the number of usable responses to each question.

among 11th-grade male (7.9%) and 12th-grade male (8.2%) 
than 9th-grade male (5.3%) students.
Because of changes in the question and response options 
starting in 2013, long-term temporal trends are not available 
for the prevalence of physical dating violence. The prevalence 
of physical dating violence did not change significantly from 
2013 (10.3%) to 2015 (9.6%).
Across 36 states, the prevalence of physical dating violence

Sexual Dating Violence
Among the 69.1% of students nationwide who dated or 
went out with someone during the 12 months before the 
survey,¶¶ 10.6% of students had been forced to do sexual 
things (counting being kissed, touched, or physically forced to 
have sexual intercourse) they did not want to do by someone 
they were dating or going out with one or more times during 
the 12 months before the survey (i.e., sexual dating violence) 
(Table 21). The prevalence of sexual dating violence was

of sexual dating violence was higher among black male (8.0%) 
and Hispanic male (7.0%) than white male (3.5%) students. 
The prevalence of sexual dating violence was higher among 
10th-grade (11.8%) than 12th-grade (9.2%) students and 
higher among 10th-grade male (7.4%) than 9th-grade male 
(4.5%) and 12th-grade male (4.6%) students.
Because of changes in the question and response options 
starting in 2013, long-term temporal trends are not available 
for the prevalence of sexual dating violence. The prevalence of 
sexual dating violence did not change significantly from 2013 
(10.4%) to 2015 (10.6%).
Across 30 states, the prevalence of sexual dating violence 
ranged from 7.5% to 14.7% (median: 10.1%) (Table 22). 
Across 19 large urban school districts, the prevalence ranged 
from 6.8% to 14.4% (median: 10.5%).
 
¶¶ The prevalence of dating or going out with someone during the 12 months 
before the survey varies slightly for physical dating violence and sexual 
dating violence because of differences in the number of usable responses 
to each question.

prevalence of current electronic vapor product use was used 
for the first time in the 2015 national YRBS, long-term 
temporal trends and 2-year temporal changes are not available 
for current cigarette, cigar, smokeless tobacco, or electronic 
vapor product use.
Across 33 states, the prevalence of current cigarette, cigar, 
smokeless tobacco, or electronic vapor product use ranged from

11th-grade male (25.5%), and 12th-grade male (30.5%) than 
9th-grade male (15.5%) students; and higher among 12th-grade 
male (30.5%) than 10th-grade male (22.6%) students.
During 1991–2015, a significant linear trend was not 
identified in the prevalence of current marijuana use (14.7%–
21.7%). A significant quadratic trend was identified. The 
prevalence of current marijuana use increased during 1991–
1995 (14.7%–25.3%) and then decreased during 1995–2015 
(25.3%–21.7%). The prevalence of current marijuana use did 
not change significantly from 2013 (23.4%) to 2015 (21.7%).
Across 36 states, the prevalence of current marijuana use 
ranged from 12.4% to 25.3% (median: 19.1%) (Table 56). 
Across 19 large urban school districts, the prevalence ranged 
from 15.9% to 28.7% (median: 22.2%).
Usually Used Marijuana by Smoking It
Among the 21.7% of students who currently used marijuana, 
90.0% usually used marijuana by smoking it in a joint, bong, 
pipe, or blunt during the 30 days before the survey (Table 55). 
The prevalence of usually using marijuana by smoking it was 
higher among female (92.5%) than male (89.0%) students 
and higher among 12th-grade female (96.7%) than 12th-grade 
male (87.4%) students. The prevalence of usually using 
marijuana by smoking it was higher among 12th-grade female 
(96.7%) than 10th-grade female (91.4%) students. Because the 
question measuring the prevalence of usually using marijuana 
by smoking it in a joint, bong, pipe, or blunt was used for the 
first time in the 2015 national YRBS, long-term temporal 
trends and 2-year temporal changes are not available.
Also, this question was not included in the standard 
questionnaire used in the state and large urban school 
district surveys in 2015. Consequently, the range and median 
prevalence estimates across states and large urban school 
districts for the prevalence of usually using marijuana by 
smoking it are not available.

male (8.9%) students. The prevalence of having ever used 
synthetic marijuana was higher among 11th-grade (10.0%) and 
12th-grade (11.0%) than 9th-grade (7.1%) students; higher 
among 10th-grade male (9.7%), 11th-grade male (11.1%), and 
12th-grade male (14.2%) than 9th-grade male (6.7%) students; 
and higher among 12th-grade male (14.2%) than 10th-grade 
male (9.7%) students. Because the question measuring the 
prevalence of having ever used synthetic marijuana was used for 
the first time in the 2015 national YRBS, long-term temporal 
trends and 2-year temporal changes are not available.
Across 27 states, the prevalence of having ever used 
synthetic marijuana ranged from 5.9% to 14.6% (median: 
9.2%) (Table 58). Across 17 large urban school districts, the

10th-grade male (7.0%), and 11th-grade male (7.0%) students.
During 2001–2015, a significant linear decrease occurred 
overall in the prevalence of having ever used hallucinogenic 
drugs (13.3%–6.4%). A significant quadratic trend also was 
identified. The prevalence of having ever used hallucinogenic

During 1991–2015, a significant linear decrease occurred 
overall in the prevalence of students describing themselves as 
overweight (31.8%–31.5%). A significant quadratic trend also 
was identified. The prevalence of students describing themselves 
as overweight decreased during 1991–1995 (31.8%–27.6%) 
and then increased during 1995–2015 (27.6%–31.5%). The

Had a Sunburn
Nationwide, 55.8% of students had a sunburn (counting 
even a small part of their skin turning red or hurting for 
12 hours or more after being outside in the sun or after using 
a sunlamp or other indoor tanning device) one or more times 
during the 12 months before the survey (i.e., had a sunburn)

Discussion
YRBSS is the largest public health surveillance system in the 
United States monitoring a broad range of health behaviors among 
high school students. YRBSS data are used widely to compare the 
prevalence of health behaviors among subpopulations of students; 
assess trends in health behaviors over time; monitor progress 
toward achieving national health objectives; provide comparable 
state and large urban school district data; and help develop, assess, 
and improve school and community policies, programs, and 
practices designed to decrease health-risk behaviors and improve 
health outcomes among youth.
Compare Health Behavior Prevalence 
Among Subpopulations of Students
YRBSS is designed to identify how health behaviors vary by 
subpopulations of high school students defined by sex and race/
ethnicity. Understanding these variations (or lack of variation) 
in health behaviors might help design, target, and identify 
the impact of school and community policies, programs, and 
practices. However, YRBSS data cannot isolate the effects of sex 
and race/ethnicity from the effects of socioeconomic status (SES) 
or culture on the prevalence of health behaviors. For example, 
in a national study, the likelihood of behavioral cardiovascular 
disease risks, including obesity, sedentary behaviors, and tobacco 
exposure, increased among adolescents aged 12–17 years as the 
SES based on poverty-income ratio decreased (14).
Variations by Sex
The prevalence of most health behaviors varies by sex. For 
example, the prevalence of two injury-related behaviors (rarely 
or never wearing a seatbelt and driving when drinking alcohol) 
was higher among male than female students. The prevalence of 
seven violence-related behaviors (carrying a weapon, carrying a 
gun, carrying a weapon on school property, being threatened or 
injured with a weapon on school property, being in a physical 
fight, being injured in a physical fight, and being in a physical 
fight on school property) was also higher among male than 
female students. However, the prevalence of having not gone to 
school because of safety concerns, being electronically bullied, 
being bullied on school property, being forced to have sexual 
intercourse, physical dating violence, and sexual dating violence 
was higher among female than male students. The prevalence 
of all five suicide-related behaviors (feeling sad or hopeless, 
seriously considering attempting suicide, having made a suicide 
plan, attempting suicide, and  having made a suicide attempt 
resulting in an injury, poisoning, or overdose that had to be 
treated by a doctor or nurse) also was higher among female 
than male students. Rarely or never wearing a bicycle helmet, 
riding with a driver who had been drinking alcohol, and texting 
or e-mailing while driving did not vary by sex.
The prevalence of nine tobacco use risk behaviors (smoking a 
whole cigarette before age 13 years; current cigarette use; usually 
obtaining their own cigarettes by buying them in a store or gas 
station; current smokeless tobacco use; current cigar use; current 
electronic vapor product use; current cigarette or cigar use; current 
cigarette, cigar, or smokeless tobacco use; and current cigarette, 
cigar, smokeless tobacco, or electronic vapor product use) was higher 
among male than female students. Having tried to quit smoking 
cigarettes, the only health promoting tobacco use behavior, had 
a higher prevalence among female than male students. However, 
the prevalence of six tobacco use behaviors (ever trying cigarette 
smoking, current frequent cigarette use, smoking more than 
10 cigarettes per day, currently smoking cigarettes daily, usually 
obtaining their own cigarettes by buying them on the Internet, and 
ever use of electronic vapor products) did not vary by sex.
The prevalence of 14 of the 21 alcohol and other drug use 
behaviors (drinking alcohol before age 13 years; having 10 or 
more as the largest number of drinks of alcohol in a row; trying 
marijuana before age 13 years; current marijuana use; ever 
using synthetic marijuana; ever using hallucinogenic drugs; ever 
using cocaine; ever using ecstasy; ever using heroin; ever using 
methamphetamines; ever taking steroids without a doctor’s 
prescription; ever taking prescription drugs without a doctor’s 
prescription; ever injecting any illegal drug; and being offered, 
sold, or given an illegal drug on school property) was higher 
among male than female students. However, the prevalence of 
ever drinking alcohol, usually obtaining the alcohol they drank 
by someone giving it to them, and usually using marijuana by 
smoking it was higher among female than male students. Four 
alcohol and other drug use behaviors (current alcohol use, having 
five or more drinks of alcohol in a row, ever using marijuana, and 
ever using inhalants) did not vary by sex.
The prevalence of four risk (ever having had sexual intercourse, 
having sexual intercourse before age 13 years, having sexual

intercourse with four or more persons during their life, and 
drinking alcohol or using drugs before last sexual intercourse) and 
one protective (condom use) sexual behavior was higher among 
male than female students, while the prevalence of five protective 
sexual behaviors (birth control pill use; IUD or implant use; shot, 
patch, or birth control ring use; birth control pill, IUD or implant, 
or shot, patch, or birth control ring use; and both condom use and 
birth control pill; IUD or implant; or shot, patch, or birth control 
ring use) was higher among female than male students. Current 
sexual activity, not using any method to prevent pregnancy, and 
having ever been tested for HIV did not vary by sex.
The prevalence of 17 of the 26 dietary behaviors (not eating 
fruit or drinking 100% fruit juices; eating fruit or drinking 
100% fruit juices two or more times and three or more times per 
day; not eating vegetables; eating vegetables two or more times 
and three or more times per day; drinking one or more, two or 
more, and three or more glasses of milk per day; drinking soda or 
pop one or more, two or more, and three or more times per day; 
drinking sports drinks one or more, two or more, and three or 
more times per day; drinking three or more glasses of water per 
day; and eating breakfast on all 7 days) was higher among male 
than female students. In contrast, the prevalence of only three 
dietary behaviors (not drinking milk, not drinking soda or pop, 
and not drinking sports drinks) was higher among female than 
male students. Eating fruit or drinking 100% fruit juices one or 
more times per day, eating vegetables one or more times per day, 
not drinking water, drinking one or more and two or more glasses 
of water per day, and not eating breakfast did not vary by sex.
The prevalence of six of the nine physical activity behaviors 
(being physically active at least 60 minutes per day on 5 or more 
days, being physically active at least 60 minutes per day on all 
7 days, participating in muscle strengthening activities, attending 
physical education classes, attending physical education classes 
daily, and playing on at least one sports team) was higher among 
male than female students. Only one physical activity behavior 
(not participating in at least 60 minutes of physical activity on 
at least 1 day) had a higher prevalence among female than male 
students. Using computers 3 or more hours per day and watching 
television 3 or more hours per day did not vary by sex.
The prevalence of obesity was higher among male than 
female students, and the prevalence of overweight did not vary 
by sex. The prevalence of describing themselves as overweight 
and trying to lose weight was higher among female than male 
students. Male students had a higher prevalence than female 
students of getting eight or more hours of sleep on an average 
school night, while female students had a higher prevalence 
than male students of using an indoor tanning device, having 
had a sunburn, and avoiding foods because of the risk of allergic 
reactions. Ever having had asthma and having seen a dentist 
did not vary by sex.
Variations by Race/Ethnicity
The prevalence of most health behaviors varies by race/ethnicity. 
The prevalence of 24 behaviors (12 risk and 12 protective) was 
higher among white than black and Hispanic students, the 
prevalence of 12 risk behaviors was higher among black than white 
and Hispanic students, and the prevalence of 10 risk behaviors was 
higher among Hispanic than white and black students. T
wenty-
three behaviors did not vary by race/ethnicity.
White students had a higher prevalence than black and 
Hispanic students of four injury-related risk behaviors 
(texting or e-mailing while driving, carrying a weapon, being 
electronically bullied, and bullying on school property), 
six tobacco-use related risk behaviors (current cigarette use; 
current frequent cigarette use; currently smoked cigarettes 
daily; current smokeless tobacco use; current cigarette or 
cigar use; and current cigarette, cigar, or smokeless tobacco 
use), three protective sexual behaviors (birth control pill use; 
birth control pill, IUD or implant, or shot, patch, or birth 
control ring use; and both condom use and birth control pill, 
IUD or implant, or shot, patch, or birth control ring use), 
six protective dietary behaviors (eating vegetables one or more 
times per day, drinking one or more and two or more glasses 
of milk per day, not drinking soda or pop, not drinking sports 
drinks, and drinking one or more glasses of water per day), 
two protective physical activity behaviors (being physically 
active at least 60 minutes per day on 5 or more days and being 
physically active at least 60 minutes per day on all 7 days), 
and three additional behaviors (having seen a dentist, indoor 
tanning device use, and having had a sunburn).
Black students had a higher prevalence than white and 
Hispanic students of two injury-related risk behaviors (rarely or 
never wearing a seatbelt and being in a physical fight), two sexual 
risk behaviors (having sexual intercourse before age 13 years 
and having sexual intercourse with four or more persons during 
their life), four dietary risk behaviors (not eating vegetables, not 
drinking milk, drinking sports drinks two or more times per day, 
and not drinking water), two physical activity risk behaviors 
(not participating in at least 60 minutes of physical activity on 
at least 1 day and watching television 3 or more hours per day), 
having had asthma, and avoiding food because eating the food 
could cause an allergic reaction.

use, and drinking alcohol or using drugs before last sexual 
intercourse), four dietary behaviors (not eating fruit or drinking 
100% fruit juices, eating fruit or drinking 100% fruit juices one 
or more times per day, and drinking soda or pop one or more 
and two or more times per day), and participating in muscle 
strengthening exercises did not vary at all by race/ethnicity.
Assess Trends in Health Behaviors  
Over Time
Because YRBSS has been implemented since 1991, YRBSS 
data can be used to assess both long-term temporal trends (i.e., 
as long as 24 years) and more recent 2-year temporal changes 
in health behaviors. This reports describes many long-term 
linear increases and decreases in prevalence, which reflect real 
reductions in risk behaviors and potential improvements in 
health outcomes among high school students nationwide.
Long-term linear decreases occurred overall in the prevalence 
of all three behaviors (for which long-term trend data were 
available) that contribute to unintentional injuries (rarely or 
never wore a bicycle helmet, rarely or never wore a seatbelt, 
and rode with a driver who had been drinking alcohol). 
However, based on significant quadratic trends, the prevalence 
of rarely or never wearing a bicycle helmet has not changed 
since 2001. Long-term linear decreases also occurred overall in 
the prevalence of eight of the 11 violence-related behaviors for 
which long-term trend data were available (carrying a weapon, 
carrying a gun, carrying a weapon on school property, being 
threatened or injured with a weapon on school property, being 
in a physical fight, being injured in a physical fight, being in 
a physical fight on school property, and being forced to have 
sexual intercourse). However, a long-term linear increase was 
identified in the prevalence of having not gone to school because 
of safety concerns; no long-term linear changes were identified 
in the prevalence of being electronically bullied and being 
bullied on school property; and, based on significant quadratic 
trends, the prevalence of carrying a weapon and carrying gun 
has not changed since 1997. In addition, long-term linear 
decreases occurred overall in the prevalence of three of the 
five suicide-related behaviors (seriously considering attempting 
suicide, having made a suicide plan, and attempting suicide). 
Based on significant quadratic trends, the prevalence of having 
made a suicide plan and attempting suicide increased since 2009.
Long-term linear decreases occurred overall in the prevalence 
of nine of the 10 tobacco use-related risk behaviors (for which 
long-term trend data were available) (ever trying cigarette 
smoking; smoking a whole cigarette before age 13 years; current 
cigarette use; current frequent cigarette use; smoking more 
than 10 cigarettes per day; currently smoking cigarettes daily; 
current cigar use; current cigarette or cigar use; and current 
cigarette, cigar, or smokeless tobacco use). The prevalence 
of current smokeless tobacco use was the only tobacco-use 
related risk behavior for which a long-term linear decrease 
was not identified. In addition, a long-term linear decrease 
was identified in the prevalence of the one tobacco use-related 
protective behavior (having tried to quit smoking cigarettes).
Long-term linear decreases occurred overall in the prevalence 
of 13 of the 18 alcohol- and other drug use-related behaviors (for 
which long-term trend data were available) (ever drinking alcohol; 
drinking alcohol before age 13 years; current alcohol use; having 
five or more drinks of alcohol in a row; trying marijuana before age 
13 years; ever using hallucinogenic drugs; ever using cocaine; ever 
using ecstasy; ever using heroin; ever using methamphetamines; 
ever taking prescription drugs without a doctor’s prescription; ever 
using inhalants; and being offered, sold, or given an illegal drug on 
school property). No long-term linear trends were identified in the 
prevalence of usually obtaining the alcohol they drank by someone 
giving it to them, ever using marijuana, current marijuana use, ever 
taking steroids without a doctor’s prescription, and ever injecting 
any illegal drug. However, based on significant quadratic trends, 
ever using marijuana decreased since 1997, current marijuana 
use decreased since 1995, ever taking steroids without a doctor’s 
prescription decreased since 2001, and ever injecting any illegal 
drug decreased since 2011.
Long-term linear decreases occurred overall in the prevalence of 
five sexual risk behaviors (ever having had sexual intercourse, having 
sexual intercourse before age 13 years, having sexual intercourse with 
four or more partners, being currently sexually active, and not using 
any method to prevent pregnancy) and a long-term linear increase 
occurred overall in the prevalence of condom use; IUD or implant 
use; and birth control pill, IUD or implant, or shot, patch, or birth 
control ring use. However, although a long-term linear increase in 
the prevalence of condom use was identified, a significant quadratic 
trend indicated that the prevalence of condom use decreased since 
2003. In addition, a long-term linear decrease occurred in the 
prevalence of having ever been tested for HIV
.
Long-term linear decreases in the prevalence of not eating fruit 
or drinking 100% fruit juices and drinking soda or pop one or 
more, two or more, and three or more times per day and long-term 
 Surveillance Summaries

US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
linear increases in eating vegetables three or more times per day 
and not drinking soda or pop are positive trends. However, long-
term linear decreases in the prevalence of eating fruit or drinking 
100% fruit juices three or more times per day and long-term linear 
increases in not eating vegetables are negative trends. Similarly, the 
long-term linear decrease in the prevalence of watching television 
3 or more hours per day which represents a decrease in sedentary 
behaviors is probably offset by the long-term linear increase in 
the prevalence of using computers three or more hours per day.
Monitor Progress Toward Achieving 
National Health Objectives
The national YRBS is the primary source of data to measure 
21 Healthy People 2020 objectives, including one leading health 
indicator (15). The Healthy People 2020 objectives provide a 
comprehensive agenda for improving the health of all persons 
in the United States during 2011–2020. This report provides 
the Healthy People 2020 targets and data from the 2015 national 
YRBS for 18 of the 21 objectives measured using the national 
YRBS (Table 125). The data indicate that, as of 2015, seven of 
these 18 objectives have been achieved, which is nearly double the 
number met when the 2013 national YRBS data were reported 
in 2014 (16). Healthy People 2020 objective C-20.3 is to reduce 
the proportion of adolescents in grades 9–12 who report using 
artificial sources of ultraviolet light for tanning to ≤14.0%. During 
2015, 7.3% of high school students nationwide had used an 
indoor tanning device (e.g., sunlamp, sunbed, or tanning booth) 
one or more times during the 12 months before the survey. 
Healthy People 2020 objective IVP-34 is to reduce physical 
fighting among adolescents to ≤28.4%. During 2015, 22.6% of 
high school students nationwide had been in a physical fight one 
or more times during the 12 months before the survey. Healthy 
People 2020 objective IVP-36 is to reduce weapon carrying by 
adolescents on school property to ≤4.6%. During 2015, 4.1% 
of high school students nationwide had carried a weapon on 
school property on at least 1 day during the 30 days before the 
survey. Healthy People 2020 objective PA-8.2.3 is to increase 
the proportion of adolescents in grades 9 through 12 who view 
television, videos, or play video games for no more than 2 hours 
per day. During 2015, 75.3% of high school students nationwide 
watched television for no more than 2 hours per day on an average 
school day. Healthy People 2020 objective SA-1 is to reduce the 
proportion of adolescents who report that they rode, during the 
previous 30 days, with a driver who had been drinking alcohol to 
≤25.5%. During 2015, 20.0% of high school students nationwide 
had ridden in a car or other vehicle driven by someone who had 
been drinking alcohol one or more times during the 30 days before 
the survey. Healthy People 2020 objective TU-2.1 is to reduce the 
proportion of adolescents who use tobacco products during the 
past 30 days to ≤21.0%. During 2015, 17.0% of high school 
students nationwide smoked cigarettes; used chewing tobacco, 
snuff, or dip; or smoked cigars, cigarillos, or little cigars on at 
least one day during the 30 days before the survey. Healthy People 
2020 objective TU-2.2 is to reduce the proportion of adolescents 
who use cigarettes during the past 30 days to ≤16.0%. During 
2015, 10.8% of high school students smoked cigarettes on at 
least one day during the 30 days before the survey. Although 
Table 125 indicates that Healthy People 2020 objective PA-3.1 to 
increase the proportion of adolescents who meet current Federal 
physical activity guidelines for aerobic activity has been met, the 
2015 YRBS prevalence estimate for aerobic physical activity is not 
comparable to the baseline prevalence estimate upon which the 
target was set because of a change in the context of the question 
starting with the 2011 national YRBS questionnaire.
To meet additional Healthy People 2020 objectives, positive 
changes in school and community policies, programs, and 
practices might be needed. For example, Healthy People 2020 
objective IVP-35 is to reduce bullying among adolescents to 
≤17.9%. During 2015, 20.2% of high school students nationwide 
were bullied on school property during the 12 months before 
the survey. Similarly, Healthy People 2020 objective SH-3 is to 
increase the proportion of students in grades 9 through 12 who 
get sufficient sleep to ≥33.2%. During 2015, 27.3% of high 
school students nationwide got 8 or more hours of sleep on an 
average school night.
Provide Comparable State and Large 
Urban School District Data
One of the strengths of YRBSS is that it provides not just 
national but state and large urban school district data. These data 
are more likely to be used to develop, improve, and evaluate state 
and local policies, programs, and practices because they reflect 
a more relevant population. It is also possible to compare data 
from the state and large urban school district surveys because 
they share similar sample designs, questionnaires, data collection 
procedures, and data processing procedures.
Across states, a range of 25 or more percentage points or a 
fivefold variation or greater was identified for the following 
15 behaviors:
• rarely or never wore a bicycle helmet (minimum: 53.0%; 
maximum: 94.1%);
• texted or e-mailed while driving (minimum: 26.1%; 
maximum: 63.2%);
• carried a weapon on school property (minimum: 2.0%; 
maximum: 10.7%);
• smoked more than 10 cigarettes per day (minimum: 2.0%; 
maximum: 14.6%);

• currently smoked cigarettes daily (minimum: 1.0%; 
maximum: 5.4%);
• usually obtained their own cigarettes by buying them on 
the Internet (minimum: 0.0%; maximum: 6.0%);
• ever used heroin (minimum: 0.9%; maximum: 5.9%);
• ever injected any illegal drug (minimum: 1.0%; 
maximum: 5.4%);
• IUD or implant use (minimum: 1.3%; maximum: 9.7%);
• shot, patch, or birth control ring use (minimum: 1.6%; 
maximum: 9.5%);
• birth control pill; IUD or implant; or shot, patch, or birth 
control ring use (minimum: 17.5%; maximum: 47.3%);
• ate vegetables one or more times per day (minimum: 
46.7%; maximum: 72.3%);
• drank one or more glasses of milk per day (minimum: 
23.0%; maximum: 51.6%);
• attended physical education classes (minimum: 29.9%; 
maximum: 87.8%); and
• attended physical education classes daily (minimum: 
5.8%; maximum: 60.7%).
Across large urban school districts, a range of 25 or more 
percentage points or a fivefold variation or greater was 
identified for the following 16 behaviors:
• rarely or never wore a bicycle helmet (minimum: 55.1%; 
maximum: 95.6%);
• being in a physical fight (minimum: 13.9%; 
maximum: 42.5%);
• smoked more than 10 cigarettes per day (minimum: 0.9%; 
maximum: 12.8%);
• currently smoked cigarettes daily (minimum: 0.3%; 
maximum: 1.6%);
• usually obtained their own cigarettes by buying them in 
a store or gas station (minimum: 14.9%; maximum: 64.5%);
• tried to quit smoking cigarettes (minimum: 35.7%; 
maximum: 81.8%);
• ever used heroin (minimum: 1.5%; maximum: 8.3%);
• ever had sexual intercourse (minimum: 25.9%; maximum: 
52.4%);
• IUD or implant use (minimum: 0.5%; maximum: 16.9%);
• shot, patch, or birth control ring use (minimum: 1.1%; 
maximum: 10.5%);
• birth control pill; IUD or implant; or shot, patch, or birth 
control ring use (minimum: 10.4%; maximum: 37.6%);
• ever been tested for HIV (minimum: 7.0%; 
maximum: 37.4%);
• drank soda or pop three or more times per day (minimum: 
2.6%; maximum: 13.5%);
• ate breakfast on all 7 days (minimum: 16.4%; 
maximum: 44.6%);
• attended physical education classes (minimum: 33.4%; 
maximum: 84.0%); and
• attended physical education classes daily (minimum: 8.6%; 
maximum: 42.7%).
Across states, the health behaviors with a range of 25 or more 
percentage points or a five-fold variation or greater were fairly 
evenly distributed across the following categories of behaviors: 
injury and violence (three), cigarette use (three), other drug 
use (two), birth control use (three), dietary behaviors (two), 
 
and physical activity (two). In contrast, across the large urban 
school districts, 81% of the health behaviors with a range of 
25 or more percentage points or a five-fold variation or greater 
were distributed across just three categories of behaviors: cigarette 
use (four), sexual behaviors (four), and dietary behaviors and 
physical activity (four). The variations in ranges might reflect 
differences in state and local laws and policies, enforcement 
practices, access to drugs, availability of effective school and 
community interventions, prevailing behavioral and social 
norms, demographic characteristics of the population, and adult 
practices and health behaviors and also highlight how changes 
in one or more of these factors might contribute to reductions 
in health-risk behaviors among high school students.
Develop, Assess, and Improve Health-
Related Policies, Programs, and Practices
In addition to measuring progress toward achieving Healthy 
People 2020 objectives, CDC and other federal agencies 
use YRBS data in a variety or reports and publications to 
stimulate support for and improvements in public health 
interventions, including 2015 NCHHSTP State Health 
Profiles (17), Indicators for Chronic Disease Surveillance (18), 
America’s Children: Key National Indicators of Well-Being, 
2015 (19), and Prevention Status Reports (20). CDC also 
uses YRBS data to assess the impact of funding initiatives. 
More specifically, YRBS data are a primary data source for 
monitoring the impact of two major CDC cooperative 
agreements: Promoting Adolescent Health Through School-
Based HIV/STD Prevention and School-Based Surveillance 
(http://www.cdc.gov/healthyyouth/fundedpartners/1308/
pdf/rfa-1308.pdf) and State Public Health Actions to Prevent 
and Control Diabetes, Heart Disease, Obesity and Associated 
Risk Factors and Promote School Health (http://www.cdc.gov/
chronicdisease/about/state-public-health-actions.htm).
At the state and local level, health and education agencies and 
nongovernmental organizations use YRBS data in a variety of 
ways to improve health-related policies, programs, and practices. 
For example, Connecticut’s YRBS data on sexual behaviors were 
used by the Connecticut State Board of Education to support 
inclusion of comprehensive sexuality education in their position 
 Surveillance Summaries
50 
MMWR / June 10, 2016 / Vol. 65 / No. 6
US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
statement on coordinated school health and by the Connecticut 
Department of Education to help develop Guidelines for the 
Sexual Health Education Component of Comprehensive Health 
Education for local school districts on best practice policies, 
programs, and instruction in sexual health education. Boston 
Public Schools used their YRBS data on sexual behaviors in an 
annual presentation to the Boston City Council to demonstrate 
the need for sexual health education and services and to garner 
support for the District Wellness Policy requiring schools to 
teach comprehensive sexual health education and provide sexual 
health services, including distribution of condoms at the high 
school level. The Hawaii Department of Health used the dietary 
behavior data from their YRBS to support their public education 
campaign (on television, in malls, and in movie theatres) to reduce 
youth consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages and to track the 
impact of school wellness policies which restrict access to sugar-
sweetened beverages on campus and at school-sponsored events. 
The Los Angeles Unified School District used their YRBS data 
to support a new Los Angeles County ordinance on electronic 
vapor products and to support passage of a city-wide ordinance 
banning electronic vapor products from public spaces, bars, and 
restaurants. Montana YRBS data on bullying were used to support 
passage of a new Student Protections Procedures rule requiring 
schools to address bullying and threatening behavior in schools, 
on school buses, at school-sponsored activities, and online and to 
create a BullyFree Montana website and toolkit. The Bureau of 
Children, Youth, and Families used New York City YRBS data on 
attempted suicide to support a mental health awareness campaign 
for teens that included videos and other online resources on New 
York City’s dedicated web site for teens and that is available as part 
of the Teen Talk Toolkit distributed to health educators in New 
York City public middle and high schools.
Limitations
The findings in this report are subject to at least four 
limitations. First, these data apply only to youth who attend 
school and, therefore, are not representative of all persons in this 
age group. Nationwide, in 2012, of persons aged 16–17 years, 
approximately 3% were not enrolled in a high school program 
and had not completed high school (21). Second, the extent 
of underreporting or overreporting of behaviors cannot be 
determined, although the survey questions demonstrate good 
test-retest reliability (5,8). Third, BMI is calculated on the 
basis of self-reported height and weight, and, therefore, tends 
to underestimate the prevalence of obesity and overweight (22). 
Fourth, not all states and large urban school districts include 
all of the standard questions on their YRBS questionnaire.
Conclusions
YRBSS is an ongoing source of high-quality data at the national, 
state, and large urban school district levels for monitoring health 
behaviors that contribute to the leading causes of mortality and 
morbidity among youth and adults in the United States. In 2015, 
in addition to the national data, 37 states and 19 large urban school 
districts obtained data representative of their high school students. 
YRBSS data are an important tool for planning, implementing, 
and evaluating public health policies, programs, and practices in 
each of these jurisdictions. Although beyond the scope of this 
report, a particular strength of YRBSS (as compared to more 
narrowly focused surveys) is that it allows analysis of the inter-
relationships among health behaviors (e.g., how alcohol and other 
drug use is associated with sexual behaviors). Similarly, because of 
its long history and consistent methodology, YRBSS can identify 
not only national long-term temporal trends in health behaviors 
overall as described in this report, but also long-term trends among 
subgroups of students (e.g., by sex or race/ethnicity) and long-term 
temporal trends at the state and large urban school district levels. 
These trend analyses are particularly valuable for understanding 
the impact of broad public health and school health policies and 
practices designed to improve the health outcomes of students.
To maintain the quality of YRBSS data, increased support 
for YRBSS, enhanced training and technical assistance for 
participating state and local health and education agencies, an 
increase in the number of states with representative data, more 
substate surveys at the large urban school district and county- 
or school-district level, and more universal use of all standard 
questions are needed. Further, to sustain the surveillance system 
over time, it is important to understand the impact of new 
education and public health laws, policies, and practices related 
to data collection that might threaten the quality of YRBSS and 
its ability to generate critical data for informing future efforts to 
protect and promote the health of youth nationwide.

 * One or more times during the 12 months before the survey.
 † Among the 68.6% of students nationwide who dated or went out with someone during the 12 months before the survey, being physically hurt on purpose (counting 
being hit, slammed into something, or injured with an object or weapon) by someone they were dating or going out with.
 § Among the 69.1% of students nationwide who dated or went out with someone during the 12 months before the survey, being forced to do sexual things (counting 
kissing, touching, or being physically forced to have sexual intercourse) they did not want to do by someone they were dating or going out with.
 ¶ 95% confidence interval.
 ** Non-Hispanic.
Note: The prevalence of dating or going out with someone during the 12 months before the survey varies slightly for physical dating violence and sexual dating 
violence because of differences in the number of usable responses to each question.

§ Non-Hispanic.
NOTE: Because of changes in question context starting in 2011, national YRBS prevalence estimates derived from the 60 minutes of physical activity question in 2011, 
2013, and 2015 are not comparable to those reported in 2009 or earlier. On the 2005–2009 national YRBS questionnaire, physical activity was assessed with three 
questions (in the following order) that asked the number of days students participated in 1) at least 20 minutes of vigorous physical activity; 2) at least 30 minutes of 
moderate physical activity; and 3) at least 60 minutes of aerobic (moderate and vigorous) physical activity. On the 2011, 2013, and 2015 national YRBS questionnaires, 
only the 60 minutes of aerobic physical activity question was included.

NOTE: Because of changes in question context starting in 2011, national YRBS prevalence estimates derived from the 60 minutes of physical activity question in 2011, 
2013, and 2015 are not comparable to those reported in 2009 or earlier. On the 2005–2009 national YRBS questionnaire, physical activity was assessed with three 
questions (in the following order) that asked the number of days students participated in 1) at least 20 minutes of vigorous physical activity; 2) at least 30 minutes of 
moderate physical activity; and 3) at least 60 minutes of aerobic (moderate and vigorous) physical activity. On the 2011, 2013, and 2015 national YRBS questionnaires, 
only the 60 minutes of aerobic physical activity question was included.

§ The target setting method for this objective was a 10% improvement from the baseline; the baseline source was the 2009 national YRBS.However, because of changes 
in question context starting in 2011, national YRBS prevalence estimates derived from the 60 minutes of physical activity question in 2011, 2013, and 2015 are not 
comparable to those reported in 2009 or earlier. On the 2005–2009 national YRBS questionnaire, physical activity was assessed with three questions (in the following 
order) that asked the number of days students participated in 1) at least 20 minutes of vigorous physical activity; 2) at least 30 minutes of moderate physical activity; 
and 3) at least 60 minutes of aerobic (moderate and vigorous) physical activity. On the 2011, 2013, and 2015 national YRBS questionnaire, only the 60 minutes of 
aerobic physical activity question was included.
