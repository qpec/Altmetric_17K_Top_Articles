Abstract
Introduction
Children consume much of their daily energy intake at school.
School district policies, state laws, and national policies, such as
revisions to the US Department of Agriculture’s school meals
standards, may affect the types of foods and beverages offered in
school lunches over time.
Methods
This study evaluated changes and disparities in school lunch char-
acteristics from 2006–2007 to 2013–2014. Data were obtained
from annual cross-sectional surveys at 4,630 public elementary
schools participating in the National School Lunch Program. Mul-
tivariate logistic regressions were conducted to examine lunch
characteristics.
Results
The percentage of schools regularly offering healthful items such
as vegetables (other than potatoes), fresh fruit, salad bars, whole
grains, and more healthful pizzas increased significantly from
2006–2007 to 2013–2014, and the percentage of schools offering
less healthful items such as fried potatoes, regular pizza, and high-
fat milks decreased significantly. Nevertheless, disparities were
evident in 2013–2014. Schools in the West were significantly
more likely to offer salad bars than were schools in the Northeast,
Midwest, or South (adjusted prevalence: West, 66.3%; Northeast,
22.3%; Midwest, 20.8%; South, 18.3%). Majority-black or major-
ity-Latino schools were significantly less likely to offer fresh fruit
than were predominantly white schools (adjusted prevalence: ma-
jority black, 61.3%; majority Latino, 73.0%; predominantly white,
87.8%). Schools with low socioeconomic status were signific-
antly less likely to offer salads regularly than were schools with
middle or high socioeconomic status (adjusted prevalence: low,
38.5%; middle, 47.4%; high, 59.3%).
Conclusion
Much progress has been made in improving the quality of school
lunches in US public elementary schools, but additional opportun-
ities for improvement remain.
Introduction
Many US children consume diets that exceed recommended
amounts of sugar and fat (1,2) and are inadequate in fruits, veget-
ables, and whole grains (3,4). Major caloric contributors to chil-
dren’s diets include sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs), desserts,
pizza, and whole-fat milks (5,6). Between 1994 and 2010, the per-
centage of children’s energy intake from sugar and fat obtained at
school improved, but flavored milks, fried potatoes, and pizza
consumed at schools still significantly contributed to empty calor-
ies in 2009–10 (1).
School meal programs play a crucial role in shaping children’s di-
ets (7,8); one-third to one-half of children’s daily energy intake is
from foods and beverages consumed during the school day (8).
Switching from SSBs and flavored milks to unflavored low-fat
milks at school and home would save elementary-aged children an
estimated average of 173 calories per day (9). Data gathered in
2004–2005 showed that most schoolchildren, particularly those

 who participated in school meals programs, consumed too much
saturated fat and sodium (10).
Most US public schools participate in the National School Lunch
Program (NSLP) (11), which provides meals to approximately 31
million students annually (11), and therefore has enormous reach
and impact on the healthfulness of options available to students
during the school day. Although meal standards are established by
the US Department of Agriculture (USDA), each local school food
authority decides what to serve. As directed by the Healthy, Hun-
ger-Free Kids Act of 2010, the USDA released new standards to
be implemented by the start of 2012–2013 (12). Key changes were
the requirement that both a fruit and a vegetable be offered each
day and that a variety of types of vegetables be offered within each
week, including groups such as dark green and red or orange. Milk
was  limited  to  nonfat  or  low-fat  (1%)  milk,  and  sweetened
flavored milk is now allowed only if nonfat. Half of grains offered
were to be whole-grain–rich by 2012–2013, increasing to all
whole-grain–rich by the 2014–2015 school year, although this
deadline was delayed until 2015–2016 (13). The provisions on fat
content may have affected fried potatoes and pizza, and some
schools reformulated pizzas to be more healthful by using lower-
fat cheese than previously used, vegetables instead of meat top-
pings, and whole-grain crusts. Recent reports show substantial im-
provements  in  school  lunches  in  elementary  and  secondary
schools (14,15); one study documented reductions in socioeco-
nomic  disparities  in  lunch  characteristics  among  secondary
schools, with more rapid improvements at smaller schools, and
significant improvements at schools serving a high proportion of
nonwhite students (15). Nevertheless, demographic and geograph-
ic disparities have not yet been examined thoroughly at element-
ary schools. Given research showing more healthful food environ-
ments at schools in the Pacific census division (California, Ore-
gon, and Washington) during 2009–2010 (16) and the relatively
early engagement of western states such as California in farm-to-
school programming (17), which has been associated with a high-
er prevalence of salad bars in schools (18), we examined potential
regional, socioeconomic, and demographic disparities.
This study examined changes in lunches at nationally representat-
ive samples of US public elementary schools from 2006–2007 to
2013–2014. Of particular interest were changes over time; dispar-
ities by region, locale, and student demographics; and the extent to
which disparities persisted in 2013–2014. Such data can indicate
which schools may benefit from additional targeted assistance.
Methods
Data were gathered as part of the Bridging the Gap research pro-
gram, a large multiyear project that examined school wellness–re-
lated policies and practices. This study used data from the Food
and Fitness elementary school survey, which was conducted annu-
ally from 2006–2007 to 2013–2014 in nationally representative
samples of schools. An overview is provided below; details are
available elsewhere (19). The study was approved by the institu-
tional review board at the University of Illinois at Chicago, with a
waiver of written documentation of consent; consent was implied
by mailing back the survey.
Sampling and weighting
Annual samples were based on sampling frames developed from
the public-use Common Core of Data from the National Center for
Education Statistics. All public elementary schools in the contigu-
ous United States and the District of Columbia that had a 3rd
grade class with at least 20 students were eligible for sampling.
Annual survey response rates using standard calculations (20)
were 54.6%, 70.6%, 61.8%, 64.5%, 57.4%, 53.3%, 59.3%, and
61.2%, respectively, across the 8 school years. Weights were de-
veloped that allowed for inference to US elementary schools; cal-
ibration adjusted for potential nonresponse bias.
Surveys were mailed to schools annually in January; a $100 in-
centive was offered for completion. Follow-up by mail, email, and
telephone occurred until July of each year. Instructions requested
that the principal complete items on school-wide practices and
policies and that a food service professional (FSP), if the school
had one, complete the food and beverage items. At most schools,
the entire survey was completed by principals; FSPs completed
surveys at 30% of schools. Analyses controlled for whether a FSP
was involved or not.
Measures
The survey was developed by researchers in 2006–2007 to be con-
sistent with items already used by the Bridging the Gap middle
and high school survey project. In addition, a research review was
used in survey development; surveys were tested with experts to
confirm face validity.
Lunch characteristics.
Lunch characteristics. Respondents were asked to indicate how of-
ten each of a list of foods and milk beverages was available to ele-
mentary students in “the school lunch meal (not à la carte),” with
response options of 1 (never), 2 (some days), or 3 (most or every
day). These items included vegetables (excluding potatoes), fresh
fruit, other fruit (eg, dried or canned fruit), salad bar, premade
main-course salads (such as chef’s salad), whole grains (such as
wheat bread or brown rice), and fried potatoes (including reheated
french fries or tater tots). Starting in 2010–2011, respondents were
asked to indicate whether the school offered “regular” pizza or
“healthier” pizza (eg, whole-wheat crust, low-fat cheese, or low-
fat toppings). Healthful items were combined as binary variables

 to compare “most or every day” versus “some days or never,”
whereas less healthful options (fried potatoes and regular pizza)
were combined to compare responses of “some days, most days,
or every day” versus “never.” Because some schools had diffi-
culty implementing the whole-grain provisions, a second ap-
proach was also used for whole grains; this approach compared
“most or every day, or some days” with “never.” Analyses showed
that some schools offered salad bars, whereas others offered
premade salads, so a new item was calculated to indicate regular
availability of any salad (either type). A series of items asking
about milk beverages at various levels of fat content and flavoring
were combined to indicate whether any high-fat milks (ie, 2% or
whole-fat, unflavored or flavored) were ever offered. Although the
new regulations do not allow 1% milk if flavored (only nonfat
flavored milk is allowed), information on milk items was not de-
tailed enough in the early years of the project to make this distinc-
tion. Thus, the current analyses considered only 2% and whole
milk (not 1% flavored milk) as high-fat milk.
Contextual factors.
Contextual factors. School-level demographic data were obtained
from public-use files from the National Center for Education Stat-
istics for use as covariates in regression analyses. Demographic
variables were the following: region (South, West, Midwest, or
Northeast); locale (urban, suburban, town, or rural); school size
(small, ≤450 students; medium, 451–621 students; or large, ≥622
students); percentage of students eligible for free or reduced-price
lunch (FRPL) as an inverse proxy for socioeconomic status (SES)
(low, ≤33% eligible; middle, >33% but ≤66% eligible; high, >66%
eligible), and racial/ethnic composition (predominantly [≥66%]
white non-Latino, majority [≥50%] black non-Latino, majority
Latino, and “other”). The “other” category included schools with
diverse populations and no majority group and schools with ma-
jority Asian or majority American Indian students.
Data analysis
The initial data set were from 5,068 schools. Because this study
focused on implementation of USDA standards, only schools par-
ticipating in the NSLP (93.6%) were included. Of the 4,745
schools participating in the NSLP, 115 did not provide data on
lunches and were excluded, leaving data from 4,630 schools for
analysis. The data were treated as repeated (stacked) cross-sec-
tions; analyses were conducted in Stata/SE version 12.0 (Stata-
Corp LP) and accounted for sampling stratum and for the cluster-
ing of schools within districts. Data were weighted to provide in-
ference to US public elementary schools.
Analyses (conducted in a multivariate logistic regression frame-
work, controlling for year, contextual covariates, and whether an
FSP participated) examined disparities and changes over time for
each of the 12 outcomes. First, a series of multivariate logistic re-
gressions examined changes over time. Adjusted prevalences (the
percentage of schools where each item was available), controlling
for covariates, were calculated. Next, a series of demographic-by-
time interactions was tested, using a linear trend for time multi-
plied separately by each demographic variable. Finally, disparities
during the 8 years (ie, main effects for contextual covariates) and
in the 2013–2014 school year only were examined.
Results
The sample included a diverse cross-section of schools (Table 1);
demographics did not differ by year, except for FRPL eligibility:
the percentage of schools at which more than two-thirds of stu-
dents were eligible for FRPL increased from 28.9% in 2006–2007
to 37.7% in 2013–2014 (consistent with national increases [21]).
The  availability  of  vegetables  increased  significantly  from
2008–2009 to 2013–2014 (Table 2); we found no time-by-demo-
graphic interactions or disparities in availability.
The availability of fresh fruit increased significantly from 60.9%
in 2006–2007 to 81.6% in 2013–2014, with no time-by-demo-
graphic interactions. We found several disparities in fresh fruit
availability,  which  remained  significant  in  2013–2014.  In
2013–2014, predominantly white schools were significantly more
likely to offer fresh fruit (adjusted prevalence, 87.8%; 95% confid-
ence interval [CI], 83.5%–92.1%) than were majority-black
schools (61.3%; 95% CI, 44.9%–77.8%; P = .002) or majority-
Latino schools (73.0%; 95% CI, 60.9%–85.1%; P = .03) but not
more likely than schools with “other” composition (82.7%; 95%
CI, 76.3%–89.1%). Multivariate models indicated that schools in
urban locales were significantly more likely to offer fresh fruit in
2013–2014 (89.0%; 95% CI, 83.9%–94.0%) than were schools in
towns (74.1%; 95% CI, 62.5%–85.8%; P = .01) or rural locales
(73.5%; 95% CI, 63.9%–83.1%; P = .01) but not suburban locales
(82.9%; 95% CI, 77.1%–88.6%).
The availability of salad bars increased significantly from 16.4%
in 2006–2007 to 31.5% in 2013–2014. Although the time-by-re-
gion interaction was not significant, we found a regional disparity,
which remained in 2013–2014 (Figure 1). In 2013–2014 the avail-
ability of salad bars was significantly higher in the West than in all
other regions (P <.001 for all comparisons).

The  availability  of  premade  salads  did  not  change  from
2006–2007 (24.7%) to 2013–2014 (24.6%), but the time-by-re-
gion interaction was significant (P = .02); availability decreased in
the Midwest, increased in the Northeast and South, and did not
change in the West (Figure 1).
We found a significant disparity in the availability of any salad
(salad bar or premade) among schools by SES status. Across all
years, low-SES schools had less availability of any salad than did
middle-SES or high-SES schools (P <.001 for both comparisons),
and in 2013–14, availability of any salad was significantly lower
in low-SES schools (38.5%; 95% CI, 29.8%–47.1%, P = .005)
than in high-SES schools (59.3%, 95% CI, 49.5%–69.1%) (P =
.005) and lower (but not significantly) than in middle-SES schools
(47.4%; 95% CI 39.7%–55.0%, P = .053).
The availability of whole grains increased significantly from
14.6% in 2006–2007 to 48.6% in 2013–2014; no time-by-demo-
graphic interactions were found. In 2013–2014, no demographic
disparities were found.
The prevalence of schools ever offering more healthful pizzas in-
creased from 64.1% in 2011–2012 to 88.1% in 2013–2014, while
the availability of regular pizza decreased. No time-by-demo-
graphic interactions or disparities were found in 2013–2014.
The percentage of schools ever offering fried potatoes decreased
significantly from 73.5% in 2008–2009 to 53.1% in 2013–2014;
no time-by-demographic interactions or disparities were found in
2013–2014.
The availability of high-fat milks decreased, and we found a signi-
ficant interaction between time and student race/ethnicity (P =
.04). Availability decreased significantly among all racial/ethnic
groups, but the decrease was slower at majority-black schools
(Figure 2). Although the prevalence of high-fat milks was higher
at majority-black schools in 2013–2014 than at predominantly
white, majority Latino, and “other” schools, the difference was not
significant.

Discussion
Using data gathered during 8 consecutive school years — during a
time of policy action at many levels and nationwide revisions to
NSLP standards — our study examined changes in the types of
foods and milk beverages offered in elementary school lunches.
Overall, the changes were positive: the availability of vegetables,
fresh fruit, salad bars, whole grains, and more healthful pizzas in-
creased, while the availability of high-fat milks, fried potatoes, and
regular pizza decreased.
A key finding was the increase in the overall availability of salad
bars, but we found important regional differences. In the Midwest,
the proportion of schools offering premade salads decreased,
whereas the proportion offering salad bars slightly increased.

 Schools in the South were more likely than other regions to offer
premade salads and were less likely to offer salad bars. One inter-
pretation of this pattern is that schools in the South may be turn-
ing to premade salads as a strategy to increase student access to
fresh fruits and vegetables. Although no evidence suggests that
premade salads are nutritionally inferior to salad bars, some evid-
ence suggests that salad bars can increase students’ fruit and ve-
getable consumption at lunch (22,23). Research is needed on the
nutritional composition of salad bars and the contribution of salad
toppings and dressings to fat and sodium consumption. Although
the cost of new equipment for salad bars can be a barrier to imple-
mentation, financial support is available through programs such as
Let’s Move Salad Bars to School, which provides financial re-
sources and technical support to implement salad bars, especially
in low-SES schools (24). Low-SES schools had less availability of
any salad than did middle-SES or high-SES schools across all sur-
vey years; in 2013–2014, low-SES schools had the least availabil-
ity of any salads, showing that continued implementation support
and resources are needed.
The prevalence of obesity among children could be decreased by
switching from SSBs and flavored milks to low-fat milk with
meals (9). Our findings on racial/ethnic disparities in milk offer-
ings are consistent with dietary intake data showing that black
children are more likely than white children to consume high-fat
milk at school (25). The smaller decreases in the prevalence of
high-fat milk in majority-black and majority-Latino schools com-
pared with predominantly white schools could reflect the percep-
tions among food service personnel of a reluctance among black
and Latino students to consume low-fat milk. Data from 17 public
school districts, however, showed that although NSLP partici-
pation rates dropped when low-calorie flavored milk was first sub-
stituted for regular-fat flavored milks, participation rates re-
covered (26).
Although children cannot make healthful choices if none are avail-
able, simply offering more healthful items may be insufficient to
change behavior. In addition to changes in offerings, promotion
and marketing interventions (eg, taste tests, social marketing) may
be needed. Such interventions increased the consumption of whole
grains (27,28) and fruit and vegetables (22) among students.
The whole-grains provision of the new NSLP standards has been
challenging for school meal programs, and the deadline for meet-
ing the provision was extended (13) to allow school food service
programs  and  manufacturers  time  to  identify  suitable  grain
products. In 2013–2014, nearly all schools (97.2%) offered whole
grains on some days, most days, or every day of the week, where-
as only half (48.6%) offered whole grains on most days or every
day. The wording of our survey items did not allow for detailed
evaluation of the types of whole-grain–rich items offered, and
some items may not have been considered by survey respondents
as whole grain, which is defined by USDA as 100% whole grain
or at least 50% whole grain with the remaining grains being en-
riched (29). Menu analysis and site audits are preferable to sur-
veys for such detailed analyses.
We cannot make clear assertions on the causes of improvements:
even before the new standards, many districts and states had im-
proved school meals. The prevalence of fresh fruit and salad bars
increased between 2010–2011 and 2011–2012, possibly in anticip-
ation of the new standards. Many districts developed local well-
ness policies in 2006–2007, and although many wellness policies
started out weak and fragmented, the comprehensiveness and
strength of meals provisions have since increased (30). Although
the USDA meal regulations were not announced until 2012, they
were based largely on recommendations from the Institute of
Medicine (7) in 2009. School food authorities may have started to
implement these changes prior to the revised USDA standards.
Our data suggest that improvements in lunches were under way
before the deadline for nationwide implementation, illustrating the
importance of policy actions at multiple levels for promoting
school-level change.
Our study has several limitations. Survey data are subject to so-
cial desirability bias or lack of knowledge among respondents. Al-
though analytic weights were adjusted for potential nonresponse
bias, other factors may have systematically biased which schools
responded. If such biases were related to school practices — for
example, if schools with better practices were more likely to re-
spond — then our estimates would be biased. Although we do not
have any evidence of response bias related to meal quality, we
cannot rule out the possibility that schools with more nutritious
meals were more likely to respond. Although we requested that
food service personnel complete the lunch items, many respond-
ents were administrators, who may have been less familiar with
lunches than food service staff would have been. It is our experi-
ence that many elementary school principals spend enough time in
the cafeteria to be able to accurately provide general information
about the presence of salad bars or the types of foods and bever-
ages available to students at lunch; however, some questions —
such as those on whole-grain–rich foods — may have been more
challenging for respondents without specialized knowledge. The
survey did not allow enough detail to consider issues such as num-
ber of servings per week, offering foods versus serving foods (ie,
what students selected), or how much food was consumed. The
current study did not assess consumption or plate waste.
Our survey data indicated that the quality of elementary school
lunches  improved  significantly  between  2006–2007  and
2013–2014. Regular availability of fresh fruits, vegetables, whole
grains and more healthful pizzas increased, and the availability of

 high-fat items such as fried potatoes, regular pizza, and high-fat
milks decreased. Changes were not uniform across the nation, but
many regional disparities disappeared by 2013–2014. Neverthe-
less, even in 2013–2014, fresh fruit was less likely to be available
at majority-black or majority-Latino schools, and schools serving
many socioeconomically disadvantaged students were less likely
to offer salads; these demographic disparities warrant attention.
Furthermore, at many schools, there is still room for improvement
in providing healthful foods regularly. Supporting the implementa-
tion of salad bars in socioeconomically disadvantaged schools
may be a key strategy for increasing access to healthful options for
all students. Our study demonstrates the power and the value of
national policy actions, such as the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids
Act, for improving school nutrition environments and supporting
the health of all US schoolchildren. It is crucial that policy makers
at the national, state, and local levels continue to support such ac-
tions and that funding be available for implementation and sustain-
ability of healthful school environments.

c The 48 contiguous states and the District of Columbia were grouped into the following census regions: South (Alabama, Arkansas, Delaware, District of Columbia,
Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Mississippi, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, West Virginia); West (Arizona,
California, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Utah, Washington, Wyoming); Midwest (Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota,
Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, Ohio, South Dakota, Wisconsin); Northeast (Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York,
Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont).
d Percentage of students eligible for free or reduced-price lunch was used as an inverse proxy for socioeconomic status.
e “Other” category comprises schools with diverse populations and no majority group and schools with majority Asian or American Indian students.
