Context: Repeated overhead throwing in baseball players alters range of motion 
(ROM), contributing to shoulder injury. The Spencer technique has been used, anec-
dotally, to reduce the effects of throwing-induced limitations in ROM. 
Objective: To quantify the effects of a single administration of the Spencer technique 
on the ROM and performance of collegiate baseball pitchers.
Methods: Pitchers from the Seton Hill University men’s baseball team were randomly 
assigned to 2 treatment groups: Spencer technique or sham therapy. The first week 
consisted of baseline outcome measurements (1 week before treatment), including 
ROM (flexion, extension, abduction, adduction, internal rotation, and external rota-
tion) of the dominant throwing arm, 10 maximum velocity throws, and self-reported 
performance using the Kerlan-Jobe Orthopaedic Clinic Shoulder and Elbow Score 
(KJOC-SES). The second week consisted of pretreatment ROM measurement, fol-
lowed by a single treatment and repeated measurement of all outcomes. 
Results: Of 16 players, 15 met inclusion criteria. An effect of training on ROM be-
tween weeks 1 and 2 for all players consisted of significantly decreased internal rota-
tion (P=.02) and increased external rotation (P=.04). A differential effect of treatment 
was found on the mean difference in internal rotation after treatment, compared with 
the mean difference before treatment on the same day (P=.01). Additionally, a trend 
toward statistical significance for abduction (P=.08) was noted. Analyses reveal that 
these effects were caused by significant increases in the internal rotation and abduc-
tion for the Spencer group only (P=.02). All other analyses of ROM, as well as per-
formance measured by maximum velocity throws and the KJOC-SES, revealed no 
differential effect of treatment. 
Conclusion: The results of this study support the use of the Spencer technique in 
counteracting the potentially negative effects of repeated throwing on internal rota-
tion. However, a single administration did not affect functional ability in this study. 
Future studies of longer duration and including differing levels of play, injury status, 
and playing position will be needed to further evaluate the full potential of the Spencer 
technique in athletes who engage in repeated overhead arm movements.

changes illustrate an imbalance in the stabilizing mus-
culature of the glenohumeral joint of the throwing arm, 
which may contribute to the development of conditions 
such as total rotational motion deficit or glenohumeral 
internal rotation deficit.15 Relative weakness of external 
rotators, in relation to internal rotators,19 as well as in-
sufficient external rotation18 have been noted in profes-
sional pitchers. Overall, deficits may result from 
adaptive changes in bone,12-14,20 soft tissue,7,15,21 and 
sensorimotor acuity22 produced by repetitive overhead 
throwing. Studies have more specifically pointed to-
ward humeral retroversion as an additional contributing 
factor in the development of rotational deficits.17,20 
Although the specific contributions of each rotational 
motion remain debated, various studies have indicated a 
risk of injury with internal rotation, total rotational mo-
tion, or external rotation deficits23; therefore, alterations 
in ROM of the glenohumeral joint due to repetitive 
throwing are highly suspect in injury development. 
 
Given that alterations in the function of the glenohu-
meral joint may contribute to injury, decreasing the defi-
cits associated with this joint has become an area of focus 
to many researchers and clinicians. Manual interventions 
that strengthen or lengthen muscles (ie, muscle energy) 
can address these deficits.24 One particular osteopathic 
manipulative treatment technique that incorporates 
muscle energy is the Spencer technique. Originally de-
veloped by C. H. Spencer in 1916, the Spencer technique 
was used to manage nonsurgical soft tissue injuries by 
slowly stretching the shoulder while putting it through its 
normal range of motion.25 Modern use of the Spencer 
technique consists of a multistep process that typically 
uses muscle energy with postisometric contraction and 
relaxation to facilitate stretching and mobility of the en-
tire shoulder, including the glenohumeral joint and ro-
tator cuff.9 The Spencer technique is primarily used in 
the outpatient setting to improve functional ROM in pa-
tients with either shoulder pain or decreased ROM and 
subsequent identification of somatic dysfunction.26,27 
This technique is also used by medical staff in profes-
T
he upper body, specifically the shoulder, is the 
most frequently injured body region in high 
school,1 collegiate,2 and professional baseball 
players.3,4 Shoulder and elbow injuries are the lead-
ing causes of baseball players needing time away from 
the sport (≥21 days).4,5 Pitchers sustain most of their 
injuries to the upper body,3,4 spend the most days on 
the disabled list,3,4,6 and receive most of their injuries 
from noncontact mechanisms.1 Throwing in baseball 
causes the most injuries of the shoulder, with 59.5% 
of all shoulder injuries resulting from throwing and 
73% of such injuries occurring in pitchers.5 Preventing 
and managing such injuries requires an understanding 
of the mechanisms by which both throwing activity 
and manipulation can alter the physiology and func-
tion of the shoulder joint. The literature, in general, 
provides a great deal of information on the possible 
effects of throwing on the shoulder. However, evidence 
for the impact of osteopathic manipulative treatment 
techniques in preventing or managing shoulder injuries 
is limited, to our knowledge. 
 
The overhead throwing motion used in baseball is a 
dynamic activity that requires precision at exceptional 
velocities. A balance between mobility and functional 
stability of the shoulder must be achieved for movement 
to occur without injury.7 Even with technically sound 
motion, overuse injuries to the shoulder can arise from 
large forces and torques applied during sequential abduc-
tion, maximal external rotation, and maximal internal 
rotation.8-10 Internal rotation during a pitch is one of the 
fastest human movements recorded,11 and the maximum 
internal rotation torque during arm cocking and com-
pressive force during arm deceleration are viewed as 
critical in overuse injuries of the shoulder. 
 
One potential mechanism contributing to shoulder 
injuries in overhead-throwing athletes involves limita-
tions in range of motion (ROM) of the glenohumeral 
joint. In baseball players, alterations in internal and 
 
external rotation have been reported in the throwing 
arm compared with the nonthrowing arm.12-18 Such

sional baseball training rooms to enhance shoulder 
strength, motion, and throwing performance before prac-
tice and games (J.A. Tuck, DO, written communication, 
August 2016). 
 
In general, use of muscle energy or long-term 
stretching protocols have been found to increase ROM of 
the glenohumeral joint in competitive baseball 
players.21,28 However, evidence describing the efficacy of 
the Spencer technique on pitchers is lacking. The present 
study aimed to quantify the effects of a single administra-
tion of the Spencer technique in healthy collegiate base-
ball players with respect to maintaining ROM of the 
glenohumeral joint and improving athletic performance. 
Methods
Participants were recruited from pitchers on the 2015-
2016 Seton Hill University men’s baseball team. To 
ensure that techniques were only administered on 
healthy shoulder joints, players were subject to selec-
tion criteria related to current and past injury. Current 
injuries to the shoulder excluded a player from the 
study. Past injuries to the shoulder, as well as current 
and past injuries to other body regions, were evaluated 
by a physician researcher (S.E.) to determine eligibility. 
Such injuries did not preclude participation as long as 
the players’ personal physician had cleared them to 
participate in sport-related activities. The physician re-
searcher also monitored the use of the Apley scratch 
test, which examines external rotation, abduction, in-
ternal rotation, and adduction29 to identify gross ROM 
deficits that would preclude participation. All experi-
mental methods were approved by the institutional re-
view board at the Lake Erie College of Osteopathic 
Medicine and Seton Hill University. Measures were in 
place to reduce risk, and all participants provided 
signed informed consent before study involvement. 
Each participant was randomly assigned to receive a 
single administration of the Spencer technique or sham 
therapy to the dominant throwing arm. 
 
The Spencer technique consisted of maintaining the 
shoulder joint into the restrictive barrier and creating 
isometric contraction of the muscles in each stage. This 
method has been thoroughly described in osteopathic 
texts and is part of standard osteopathic medical educa-
tion.30,31 The isometric variety of the Spencer technique 
was used as described by DiGiovanna et al.30(pp444-447) 
The postisometric contraction replication steps con-
sisted of 3 cycles of isometric contraction (at 3-5 lb 
subjective force) followed by a 2-second relaxation 
phase and subsequent movement of the joint to the new 
restrictive barrier. 
 
The sham therapy was designed to simulate the 
Spencer technique without engaging restrictive barriers 
or activating muscle contractions. Similarities between 
the Spencer technique and sham therapy include partici-
pant positioning, clinician positioning, number of steps, 
stabilization of the shoulder, and hand placement. One 
student researcher was responsible for all administra-
tions of the Spencer technique, and another student re-
searcher administered the sham therapy. Administration 
of each technique was completed under the supervision 
of an osteopathic physician (S.E.).
Assessment
Outcome assessment consisted of measuring players’ 
physical performance and self-reported abilities. Phys-
ical measures included ROM and maximum velocity 
throwing (MVT), and self-reported ability was assessed 
using the previously validated Kerlan-Jobe Orthopaedic 
Clinic Shoulder and Elbow Score (KJOC-SES).32,33 Re-
searchers measuring ROM, MVT, and KJOC-SES were 
blinded to the group assignment of each player.
 
The active ROM of the throwing arm was mea-
sured using a commercially available goniometer with 
bubble inclinometer, which limits measurement 
 
variability by ensuring appropriate placement of the 
goniometer arm relative to the ground. Goniometers 
may be used for the assessment of flexion, extension, 
abduction, adduction, internal rotation, and external 
rotation of the shoulder34 and have been used success-
fully in other studies that assessed ROM of the gleno-
humeral joint.7,13-15,21,35,36 As goniometry for shoulder 
measurements can be done effectively from either a

Study Duration and Schedule
The study was conducted during winter training to allow 
for the most control of the study schedule and experi-
mental variables (ie, limited travel and competitive play 
and consistency of training schedules). Each player par-
ticipated in 1 baseline visit (1 week before treatment) plus 
a 20-minute study session 1 week later. A single treatment 
using muscle energy can produce immediate effects on 
ROM,28 and the effects of the Spencer technique on ROM 
in nonathletes have been shown to occur in 2 bursts, with 
the first burst starting immediately and beginning to pla-
teau around 2 to 3 weeks.41 Accordingly, a 2-week study 
involving a single administration of the technique allowed 
for focus on the early effect of treatment. 
 
The baseline visit consisted of (1) acquisition of in-
formed consent; (2) completion of a prestudy question-
naire that addressed basic demographic information, 
involvement with baseball and other athletic activities, 
sports-related injuries and treatment, and current sports 
conditioning schedule; and (3) baseline measurements of 
ROM, MVT, and the KJOC-SES. The subsequent study 
session consisted of both pre- and posttreatment mea-
surements of ROM. The MVT and KJOC-SES were 
completed once per session because repeated MVT ses-
sions could have fatigued the arm, and KJOC-SES scores 
reflect global functioning for which changes would not 
be immediately evident during the study session. 
 
The baseball team coaches and athletic trainers were 
consulted in the study design to ensure viability of proce-
dures in conjunction with team training schedules. 
 
To avoid injury and ensure consistency with regular 
training and subsequent study procedures, each player 
underwent his normally scheduled warm-ups before expo-
sure to any study procedures. Such activities included 
stretching, jogging and cardiovascular warm-ups, 
 
armband work, and warm-up throwing. The training 
schedule during the study consisted of conditioning and 
practice sessions 6 days per week, with players each 
having 1 maximum pitching day per week. To limit the 
potential effect of fatigue on measurements of MVT, study 
methods were conducted on the player’s maximum 
pitching day, after warm-up but before pitching practice. 
seated or supine position,37 measurements were con-
ducted with the player seated on the edge of a chair, 
with feet flat on the floor. Internal and external rota-
tion was measured with the shoulder at 90º of abduc-
tion and elbow flexed to 90º. Two student researchers 
were involved in each ROM station; one stabilizing 
the scapula, while the other measured ROM and re-
corded results. All researchers measuring ROM re-
ceived the same training and were monitored by a 
physician during each session. Players were measured 
at the same ROM station before and after treatment, 
and researchers were blinded to treatment. 
 
Consistent with a previous study,38 the MVT ses-
sion consisted of 10 overhand throws at the player’s 
maximal velocity. Each throw was restricted to a 
1-step motion with normal follow-through. Throws 
were measured using the Seton Hill baseball team’s 
radar gun and immediately recorded by a single inves-
tigator. The average velocity of the 10-throw session 
was calculated and used for subsequent analysis. A 
previous study39 has suggested the potential for a 
short-term decrease in athletic performance after pas-
sive stretching during regular warm-up activities; this 
decline can be avoided using practice movements at a 
submaximum velocity before measuring maximum 
velocity.39 Because players engaged in stretching of 
the upper extremities during routine warm-up, each 
player performed 10 practice throws at a subjective 
80% maximum velocity before MVT measurements.
 
In further assessing functional abilities, players com-
pleted the KJOC-SES, a 10-item self-report measure that 
asks players to rate their abilities during game and prac-
tice conditions from 1 to 10 by placing a mark along an 
answer spectrum that ranged from low to high level of 
performance.32,33 A score of 90 of 100 on the KJOC-SES 
is considered “normal” at the professional level.33 
This method is considered superior to other self-report 
measures, such as the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulders 
and Hand questionnaire and the American Shoulder and 
Elbow Surgeons standard assessment form, because of 
its ability to specifically quantify functional status in 
overhead-throwing athletes.40

week 1 with the pretreatment measurements from week 
2 for all players combined. Given that no treatment was 
applied between these 2 measurements, this analysis al-
lowed us to investigate changes in ROM from a week of 
training alone. A significant decrease in internal rotation 
(t14=2.53, P=.02) and increase in external rotation 
(t14=−2.25, P=.04) were noted (Figure 1). No significant 
differences were found in total rotational motion, flexion, 
extension, abduction, or adduction from week 1 to week 
2 (all P>.05). 
 
Evaluation of the effect of treatment occurred in 2 
stages: (1) evaluation of paired week-2 pre- vs post-
treatment measurements for each treatment condition 
and (2) comparison of the mean difference between 
paired pre- and posttreatment ROM measurements as 
a function of treatment type. Significant differences 
were found between the paired pre- and posttreat-
ment measurements of internal rotation (t6=3.24, 
P=.02) and abduction (t6=3.04, P=.02) in the Spencer 
group (Figure 2A), whereas no such differences were 
noted within the sham therapy group (Figure 2B). 
Figure 3 displays the mean paired difference (ie, 
posttreatment minus pretreatment) in ROM during 
week 2 for each condition. Analysis revealed a dif-
ferential effect of treatment on the mean difference 
in ROM for internal rotation (t7=−3.11, P=.01) and a 
trend toward statistical significance for abduction 
(t7=−1.89, P=.08). No additional effects were re-
ported for any other ROM measurement. 
Maximum Velocity Throwing
With respect to MVT, a significant difference in speed 
was found between paired week 1 and week 2 velocities 
for all players combined (t13=4.14, P=.001), as well as 
within each individual treatment condition (Spencer: 
t6=2.83, P=.03 vs sham: t6=2.79, P=.03). Speeds de-
creased similarly for both treatment groups, with the av-
erage speed decreasing by 2.81 mph in the Spencer 
group and 2.94 mph in the sham therapy group. No evi-
dence was found for an effect of treatment with respect to 
the amount of change in velocity between week 1 and 
week 2 (t12=−0.09, P=.93).
Data Analysis
Initial data records were completed by hand for each of 
the measurement methods, ensuring that no identifying 
information was present on any paper form. Data from 
each of the forms was coded and compiled into a spread-
sheet for later analysis. Basic descriptive measures were 
calculated in Microsoft Excel (Microsoft Corporation), 
and additional statistical tests were carried out using the 
statistical computing program R version 3.2.3 (R Foun-
dation for Statistical Computing). Statistical analyses of 
differences between groups were completed using stu-
dent t tests and Fisher exact tests, with the criterion for 
significance set at P<.05 (2-tailed). 
Results
Of 16 players, 15 met inclusion criteria. The mean (SD) 
age was 20.1 (1.5) years. All players reported playing at 
the competitive level throughout both high school and 
college. Every player had participated in another sport at 
some point while playing competitive baseball. Two 
players, 1 from the Spencer group and 1 from the sham 
therapy group, reported current participation in another 
sport. These other activities were seasonal, with both 
players reporting participation in golf and one also 
 
participating in bowling. The Table provides additional 
player characteristics. No statistically significant differ-
ences were found between the treatment groups with 
 
respect to any of these characteristics (all P>.05). 
 
Although 2 players from the Spencer group and 5 from 
the sham therapy group had missed playing time in the 
past year because of a shoulder or elbow injury, all had 
been treated and were cleared for full participation at the 
time of the study. No players reported the development 
or treatment of any injuries during the study. Equipment 
malfunction occurred during the study session for 
 
1 player. As such, the week-2 MVT and KJOC-SES data 
for this player were unavailable for analysis. 
Range of Motion

the difference between the baseline measurements in

showing a differential effect of treatment on internal ro-
tation. Specifically, internal rotation was statistically 
significantly increased after administration of the 
Spencer technique, whereas no such effect was found as 
a result of sham therapy. A trend toward a differential 
increase in abduction as a result of treatment was also 
found, with a statistically significant difference from pre- 
to posttreatment ROM being found in the Spencer group 
only. This additional finding is not surprising given that 
abduction is one of the movements for which large force 
is applied during overhead throwing8-10 and is also ad-
dressed by the Spencer technique.30,31 No such treatment 
effects were found with respect to external rotation, al-
though training alone had altered this movement. Given 
Self-Report of Function
The mean (SE) KJOC-SES score for the sham therapy 
group was 83.90 (4.73) in week 1 and 81.70 (6.90) in 
week 2. For the Spencer group, the mean (SE) for 
 
week 1 was 92.21 (3.01) and 91.33 (3.57) in week 2. No 
 
significant difference was found between week 1 and 
week 2 measurements overall (t13=1.11, P=.29) or when 
separated by group (Spencer: t6=0.59, P=.58 vs sham: 
t6=0.90, P=.40). Additionally, no effect of treatment was 
reported in either week (week 1: t12=1.48, P=.16 vs week 
2: t12=1.23, P=.24). Exploratory analyses revealed no 
strong relationships between the week 2 KJOC-SES and 
posttreatment MVT (Pearson r=0.43) or internal rotation 
(Pearson r=0.41). Of the 14 players for which both 
weeks of data were available, 6 were below 90 on at least 
1 of the 2 days (3 from each treatment group). 
Discussion
Repeated overhead throwing motions can alter the sta-
bility and flexibility of the glenohumeral joint,9,12-15 and 
studies specifically involving pitchers have reported in-
creased external rotation and decreased internal rotation 
in the throwing arm.12-15 In concordance with the litera-
ture, the present study revealed increased external rota-
tion and decreased internal rotation between week 1 and 
week 2 pretreatment measurements (Figure 1). The lack 
of diminished total rotational motion identified in the 
current study also lends support to previous literature 
indicating that similar levels of decreased internal rota-
tion and increased external rotation can balance out total 
rotational motion,13,16 possibly limiting any appreciable 
differences in function or injury.23 As no treatment had 
been performed between the week-1 baseline and week-2 
pretreatment measurements, the effects noted are consid-
ered to be those of training alone. 
 
The purpose of the Spencer technique is to assist in 
returning the glenohumeral joint to its normal structural 
and functional balance by managing restrictions in 
ROM. Thus, we anticipated alterations in internal rota-
tion to be in direct opposition of the observed training-
induced effects. Our results confirmed this expectation,

lengthening may occur because of the creation of 
heat31 and temporary muscle fatigue30 that occur 
during contraction and relaxation. In the current study, 
players exposed to sham therapy were not actively 
resisting motion and, although motions toward the 
restrictive barrier were completed, care was taken to 
not engage this barrier. Thus, the Golgi tendon appa-
ratus was not activated, heat was not generated, and 
muscular fatigue did not occur. 
 
With respect to performance, no differential effect 
of treatment was reported in MVT or KJOC-SES 
scores. This finding is consistent with previous inves-
tigation of static stretching41 and other manipulation 
of the glenohumeral joint before throwing.38 Williams 
et al38 suggested that a reason for the lack of differen-
tial effect of treatment could be the complexity of the 
overhead throwing motion, which has the potential to 
be influenced by many factors. According to previous 
literature, restoring internal rotation may have the 
potential to affect injuries related to rotational imbal-
ance.7,21 Although a single administration of the 
Spencer technique immediately increased internal ro-
that the goal of the Spencer treatment in the present 
study was to reduce diminished rotation created by re-
peated use of the throwing arm, the lack of effect on a 
rotation that had been previously increased by training 
is not entirely unexpected. However, as alterations in 
both strength and rotational motion of the external rota-
tors have been implicated in overuse injuries18,19 and 
recognized as potentially beneficial in the prevention of 
injury,41 additional techniques focused on the assess-
ment and alteration of the external rotators remain an 
important area for future investigation. 
 
The differential effects on internal rotation found 
in the present study are proposed as a function of 
muscle relaxation and lengthening around the gleno-
humeral joint produced by the Spencer technique. In 
short, the Spencer technique involves the creation of 
isometric contraction of the muscles while main-
taining the shoulder joint into the restrictive barrier. 
This contraction has historically been thought to acti-
vate the Golgi tendon apparatus of the agonist mus-
cles, causing reflex inhibition of contraction and 
allowing muscle lengthening. Further promotion of

tation in the present study, our findings do not support 
the potential of this technique to immediately improve 
throwing ability. Additional factors that have the po-
tential to explain these results include the short nature 
of the study and the fact that both the Spencer tech-
nique and KJOC-SES are generally reserved to assess 
and manage injuries. 
 
One limitation of the present study is that we used a 
single manipulation of the glenohumeral joint. Future 
studies should examine the impact of repeated adminis-
tration of the Spencer technique on structural and func-
tional outcomes. Additionally, all players in the present 
study were healthy and medically cleared to participate 
in athletic activities, even though nearly half would 
have been considered to be functioning below full ca-
pacity because of KJOC-SES scores below 90.33 Of 
note, the study by Kraeutler et al33 was specific to pro-
fessional baseball pitchers, and the current study fo-
cused on collegiate athletes. As such, it is possible that 
the normal range could be different between these 2 
populations. Because the players in the present study 
were all healthy and asymptomatic, the low responses 
further highlight the importance of evaluating shoulder 
function before reported injury. Subsequent reevalua-
tion after injury and treatment would assist in better 
understanding the differences between normal func-
tional ability, injured ability, and recovery. 
 
Future studies should investigate the impact of the 
Spencer technique on symptomatic players. Safety and 
feasibility studies within both asymptomatic and symp-
tomatic populations, followed by well-designed random-
ized controlled trials and longitudinal follow-up, are 
necessary before claims regarding efficacy of the 
Spencer technique can be made. Such findings would be 
imperative in determining the potential of the Spencer 
technique to assist injured players in returning to normal 
sporting activities and prevent injury in noninjured 
players. Additionally, the present study is limited by size, 
and power analysis will be an important consideration 
for ensuring that an adequate number of pitchers are 
evaluated in future studies aiming to make claims on the 
efficacy of this technique.

Conclusion
The Spencer technique appeared to counteract the poten-
tially detrimental effects of repeated throwing on the in-
ternal rotation of the glenohumeral joint in collegiate 
baseball players. Future studies of longer duration should 
allow for assessment of the long-term implications of 
treatment, including the potential for improved perfor-
mance and decreased injury rates. Additionally, studies 
that investigate the safety and effectiveness of this 
method on returning players to the sport after injury are 
important. Taken together, studies of this nature will 
allow for a much more thorough understanding of the 
capabilities of the Spencer technique and its appropriate 
use in baseball players.
