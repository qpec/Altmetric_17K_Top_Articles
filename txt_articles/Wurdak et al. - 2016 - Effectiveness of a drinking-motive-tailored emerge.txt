The aim of this study is to develop and test the effectiveness of a drinking-motive-tailored intervention for
adolescents hospitalized due to alcohol intoxication in eight cities in Germany between December 2011 and
May 2012 against a similar, non-motive-tailored intervention. In a randomized controlled trial, 254 adolescents
received a psychosocial intervention plus motive-tailored (intervention group; IG) or general exercises (control
group; CG). Adolescents in the IG received exercises in accordance with their drinking motives as indicated at
baseline (e.g. alternative ways of spending leisure time or dealing with stress). Exercises for the CG contained al-
cohol-related information in general (e.g. legal issues). The data of 81 adolescents (age: M = 15.6, SD = 1.0;
42.0% female) who participated in both the baseline and the follow-up were compared using ANOVA with re-
peated measurements and effect sizes (available case analyses). Adolescents reported lower alcohol use at the
four-week follow-up independently of the kind of intervention. Significant interaction effects between time
and IG were found for girls in terms of drinking frequency (F = 7.770, p b 0.01) and binge drinking
(F =7.0005, p b 0.05) but not for boys. For the former, the proportional reductions and corresponding effect
sizes of drinking frequency (d = −1.18), binge drinking (d = −1.61) and drunkenness (d = −2.87) were
much higher than the .8 threshold for large effects. Conducting psychosocial interventions in a motive-tailored
way appears more effective for girls admitted to hospital due to alcohol intoxication than without
motive-tailoring. Further research is required to address the specific needs of boys in such interventions.

Introduction
Alcohol use is the number one risk factor for morbidity and mortality
among young people in established market economies (Rehm et al.,
2006). Comparing different risk factors for disability-adjusted life-
years among 10 to 24-year-olds worldwide, Gore et al. (2011) identified
alcohol use as the most important one.
Across Europe, the number of adolescents admitted to hospital due
to alcohol intoxication has risen in the last two decades (Slovak Repub-
lic: Kuzelova et al., 2009; Croatia: Bitunjac & Saraga, 2009; Netherlands:
Bouthoorn et al., 2011). For example, in 2013, 23,267 ten to nineteen-
year-olds in Germany were treated in hospital because of alcohol intox-
ication (Federal Statistical Office, 2015), which represents an increase of
more than 40% compared to the year 2004. This is particularly worrying
as alcohol intoxication can lead to hypoglycemia, hypothermia, injuries
and coma (Lamminpää, 1995). Furthermore, risky drinking in adoles-
cence is correlated with poor academic performance, unplanned
pregnancy, violence and accidents (Gmel et al., 2003).
Adolescents brought to hospital emergency rooms can be consid-
ered as a ‘window of opportunity’ for delivering interventions aimed
at counteracting alcohol intoxication. Adolescents and young adults
with problematic alcohol use reported reduced alcohol consumption
and fewer alcohol-related problems after participating in a motivational
interviewing (MI) intervention compared to standard care, which
consisted, for example, of general medical practice or the provision of
handouts or brief feedback (Spirito et al., 2004; Monti et al., 1999;
Monti et al., 2007; Bernstein et al., 2010).
The most widely implemented emergency room intervention in
Germany targeting adolescents' acute alcohol intoxication is “HaLT”
(Hart am Limit; Villa Schöpflin, 2009). In addition to standard medical
care, HaLT consists of a psychosocial intervention on the morning after

 admission usually conducted by a social worker and includes motiva-
tional interviewing strategies (Rollnick & Miller, 1995) to enhance ado-
lescents' commitment to cutting down risky alcohol use. In addition,
information on the effects of alcohol is given and the previous day's
events which led to this severe intoxication are discussed (Stolle et al.,
2009; Stürmer & Wolstein, 2011). Adolescents are also invited to
participate in a group intervention, where they can discuss their drink-
ing motives within the setting of outdoor activities (Villa Schöpflin,
2009). Adolescents who participated in this group intervention showed
better results with regard to episodic heavy drinking than the non-
participating group (Wurdak et al., 2014).
Up to now, the HaLT intervention did not account for drinking
motives. This is particularly regrettable since the factors proximate to
drinking, such as motives, are not only thought to be more easily
accessible for prevention efforts than distal factors, but also tend to re-
flect or include such distal factors as culture, situation or personality
(Cox & Klinger, 1988, 1990; Kuntsche et al., 2006a). Drinking motives
are the final pathway to alcohol use, the gateway through which
more distal influences, such as personality characteristics or cultural
differences, are mediated (Kuntsche et al., 2008, 2015).
According to the Motivational Model of Alcohol Use (Cox & Klinger,
1988, 1990), drinking motives can be classified by crossing two dimen-
sions (source: internal or external and kind of reinforcement: positive
or negative) to obtain four different categories: enhancement, social,
coping and conformity motives (Cooper, 1994; see Table 1 for item ex-
amples). High scores in enhancement motives are associated with
heavy drinking (Cooper, 1994; Kuntsche et al., 2014; Wurdak et al.,
2010) and coping motives are also linked to alcohol-related problems
(Cooper, 1994; Kuntsche et al., 2005).
Kuntsche and Gmel, (2004), Kuntsche et al. (2005, 2006b, 2010b)
and Kuntsche and Labhart (2013b) therefore describe two different
risk groups that basically differ in terms of positive and negative rein-
forcement (cf. Table 1). Enhancement drinkers tend to enjoy the feeling
of drunkenness and their motives often appear in conjunction with per-
sonality traits such as extraversion, impulsivity or sensation-seeking
(internal positive reinforcement). Additionally, they often drink with
their peers and thus score high on social motives (external positive re-
inforcement). Coping drinkers tend to be introvert and anxious and con-
sume alcohol on their own to forget about their worries and problems
(internal negative reinforcement). Furthermore, they tend to drink to
be liked or accepted by others or gain access to peer groups and thus
score high on conformity motives (external negative reinforcement).
One-size-fits-all interventions do not take into account the particu-
lar needs of these two groups. Experts point out that “it might be
more effective if enhancement and coping drinkers were targeted by
distinct prevention programs that take into account their specific
needs and problems” (Kuntsche & Cooper, 2010a, p. 52). For example,
coping drinkers in particular are thought to benefit from stress relaxa-
tion techniques as they drink to forget about their problems and to
reduce their stress levels.
However, to our knowledge, drinking motives have not yet been
considered in psychosocial interventions within the setting of emergen-
cy rooms. Conrod et al. (2006, 2011) tested personality-targeted inter-
ventions in order to reduce alcohol consumption among adolescents,
but drinking motives were addressed only indirectly and the interven-
tion appears unsuitable for implementation in an emergency-room
setting since it is a time-consuming process consisting of two 90-
minute group sessions.
When developing and testing motive-tailored interventions, it is im-
portant to take gender differences into account as boys score higher on
enhancement motives, whereas coping drinkers tend to be female
(Kuntsche et al., 2006a,b) and as the prevalence of alcohol consumption
and binge drinking is higher among boys (Kraus et al., 2011).
The aim of this study is to develop drinking-motive-tailored
interventions for alcohol-intoxicated adolescents and to test whether
participants receiving a motive-tailored intervention show a greater re-
duction in alcohol consumption compared to the HaLT psychosocial in-
tervention applied in general (i.e. a non-motive-tailored intervention).
Methods
Study design
In a randomized controlled trial (see Fig. 1, drawn up in accordance
with the CONSORT Statement: www.consort-statement.org), adoles-
cents who were admitted to hospital between December 2011 and
May 2012 in one of the six largest HaLT centers in Bavaria (Augsburg,
Bamberg, Erlangen, Munich, Nuremberg and Schweinfurt) and at two
large HaLT centers in two other federal states of Germany (Hanover in
Lower Saxony and Leipzig in Saxony) were randomly assigned either
to the motive-tailored HaLT intervention group (IG) or to the standard
HaLT intervention, here regarded as the control group (CG).
Sample size was determined with the software G*Power 3 (http://
www.psycho.uni-duesseldorf.de/abteilungen/aap/gpower3/).
With
alpha = 5%, power = 80% and effect size = 0.35 a sample size of n =
204 was calculated. The original sample consisted of 254 adolescents,
randomized into those who received motive-tailored HaLT interven-
tions (IG; n = 120) and those who were given general (CG; n = 134)
HaLT interventions. The simple randomization into these two groups
was conducted via a RANDOM algorithm on the tablet PC. Thereof,
199 adolescents (78.3%) provided their e-mail-address and were invited
to visit the website, complete booster sessions and fill out the follow-up
questionnaire. From this sample, we obtained 81 follow-up question-
naires, equating to a response rate of 40.7% (i.e. 31.9% of the original
sample). This final analytic sample did not differ from the non-
response sample in terms of age (t = −0.789, p = 0.431) and gender
(Chi2 = 0.014, p = 0.904). Furthermore, there were no significant
differences regarding drinking frequency (t = 0.017, p = 0.986), fre-
quency of binge drinking (t = 0.911, p = 0.363) and drunkenness
days (t = 1.960, p = 0.05). Adolescents in the analytic sample differed
from the non-response sample in terms of the type of schooling (Chi2 =
13.469, p b 0.05; participants with lower educational levels are under-
represented in the final sample).
Data collection took place in the hospital just before the intervention
started (baseline, t1) and four weeks later via an online questionnaire
(follow-up, t2). Adolescents had to give their informed consent to take
part in the study. Participants received an online voucher (amazon.de)
worth 15 euros for completing the follow-up questionnaire. The
study was approved by the ethics committee of the University of
Bamberg and registered in the German Clinical Trials Register (DRKS
ID: DRKS00005588).
Procedure
To be able to specifically target the intervention, combinations of
motives were used to account for the two risk groups with internal pos-
itive or negative reinforcement (enhancement or coping motives),
which are further specified according to the score for external positive
or negative reinforcement (social or coping motives). Consequently, ad-
olescents were classified into six groups: ‘pure’ enhancement drinkers
(low social motives), ‘pure’ coping drinkers (low conformity motives),
drinkers with enhancement and social motives, drinkers with coping

 and conformity motives, drinkers scoring high on both enhancement
and coping motives, and those scoring low on these motives. This
classification took place after randomization. Based on the participant's
answers in the drinking motive questionnaire revised short form
(DMQ-R SF; Kuntsche & Kuntsche, 2009), we developed a classification
algorithm for allocating the participants to one of the six groups. The
classification algorithm was based on a comparison of the means and
z-values of the DMQ-R answers. e.g., to be classified as an enhancement
and coping drinker, the mean score on enhancement motives had to be
the same as the mean score on coping motives and both z-values need-
ed to be positive (further information on the algorithm can be obtained
from the authors on request).
Based on this classification and in addition to the HaLT intervention,
adolescents from the IG were offered a set of different motive-tailored
exercises designed to provide alternative ways of fulfilling the specific
needs of the six motive groups. For example, enhancement and social
drinkers received exercises relating to alternative ways of spending
their leisure time, sensation-seeking activities and dealing with peer
pressure. Coping drinkers were shown ways of dealing with problems
and stress and introduced to various relaxation methods. Likewise, as
an add-on to the HaLT psychosocial intervention, participants from
the CG received exercises with alcohol-related information in general,
for example on legal drinking age or the effects of alcohol intoxication
and first aid activities.
We developed 27 different exercises, each taking about ten minutes
to complete. The exercises were based on evaluated treatment pro-
grams or psychological theories on, for instance, interpersonal skills
(e.g. Hinsch and Pfingsten, 2007), protective behavioral strategies
(LaBrie et al., 2011) and dealing with stress (Lohaus et al., 2007). For
example, exercises in stress reduction for coping drinkers refer to the
evaluated training program for adolescents developed by Beyer and
Lohaus (2005, 2006), which is based on problem-solving competencies
(cf. Fig. 2 for an example). All exercises contained educational
information as well as interactive sections. Video clips, audio files, pic-
tures or quotes from celebrities were included to catch the adolescents'
attention and to make the exercises more attractive. All adolescents
were asked to complete booster sessions at home (motive-tailored in
the IG and general in the CG). Both groups completed exercises on tablet
PCs (at the hospital) and via the Internet (at home), thus balancing out
any potential bias from the use of modern communication devices.
Social workers who conducted the intervention received a training
session and a detailed manual including information on the theoretical
background, instructions on how to use the tablet PCs and explanations
of the data collection procedure and the different exercises. Adolescents
completed the baseline questionnaire and one exercise (motive-
tailored in the IG, general in the CG) on the tablet PC as part of the
HaLT psychosocial intervention on the morning after their admission.
Booster sessions were provided on the website and participants were
asked to complete these at home. Participants who filled out the
follow-up questionnaire visited the website on average three times
(median = 3.0) in the four-week period and spent approximately
28 min (median = 25.0) there. Participants from the IG reported that
they visited the website more often (M = 3.65, SD = 4.94) and spent
more time (M = 32.19, SD = 32.17) on the exercises than CG adoles-
cents (frequency: M = 2.60, SD = 1.94; time: M = 24.77, SD =
17.10), but these differences were not statistically significant (frequen-
cy: t = 1.31, p = 0.193; time: t = 1.18, p = 0.244).

 enhancement, social, coping and conformity motives (see Table 1 for
item examples) within the past 30 days on a five-point scale from 1 =
never to 5 = always. Its validity and reliability have been demonstrated
in a variety of studies across Europe (Németh et al., 2011; Mazzardis
et al., 2010; Kuntsche et al., 2014; Kuntsche et al., 2015). Internal consis-
tencies (Cronbach's Alpha) were .81, .85, .88 and .88 for enhancement,
social, coping and conformity motives, respectively.
Alcohol consumption
Questions were adapted from the European School Survey Project on
Alcohol and Other Drugs (ESPAD; Hibell et al., 2009; Kraus et al., 2008),
requested numerical responses (0–30) and included frequency of alco-
hol consumption (During the last 30 days: On how many days have you
had any alcoholic beverage to drink, e.g. beer, wine/sparkling wine, mixed
drinks, alcopops or spirits?), frequency of binge drinking (During the
last 30 days: On how many days have you had five or more alcoholic drinks,
e.g. beer, wine/sparkling wine, mixed drinks, alcopops or spirits?) and fre-
quency of drunkenness (During the last 30 days: On how many occasions
(if any) have you been intoxicated from drinking alcoholic beverages so
that you e.g. staggered when walking, were not able to speak properly, or
could not remember anything the next day?).
Statistical analyses
Following the recommendation of Armijo-Olivo et al. (2009), we did
not conduct intention-to-treat analyses as “interpretation of the ITT
analysis is difficult if (…) the proportion of patients who drop out is sig-
nificant. ITT is inappropriate for efficacy researchers and clinicians since
it analyses the effect of treatment prescribed and not the effect of
treatment received“(Armijo-Olivo et al., 2009, p. 41). For these reasons
we performed an available case analysis.
To test whether the motive-tailored intervention resulted in a great-
er reduction in alcohol consumption compared to the standard HaLT in-
tervention plus general exercises, we used ANOVAs with repeated
measurements. Unfortunately, comparative statistical tests rarely yield
significant results when using small samples, which is usually the case
when dealing with adolescents admitted to hospital due to acute alco-
hol intoxication (Monti et al., 1999; Spirito et al., 2004). We therefore
also calculated the proportional reduction in alcohol consumption
from baseline to follow-up and the corresponding effect sizes (Cohen's
d) according to the formula for different variances but same sample
sizes (Bortz & Döring, 2006). Cohen's d values of 0.8, 0.5 and 0.2 repre-
sent large, medium and small effects, respectively (Bortz & Döring,
2006). Effect sizes like Cohen's d are regarded as particularly suitable
for assessing the practical relevance of interventions (Kessler, 2015).
Due to gender differences regarding alcohol consumption and drinking
motives (Holmila & Raitasalo, 2004; Kuntsche et al., 2006b,c; Kuntsche
and Kuntsche, 2009; Kraus et al., 2011), all analyses were conducted
separately for each gender.
Results
Descriptive statistics
The randomization was successful since the IG and the CG from the
final sample did not differ in terms of age (t = −0.328, p = 0.744), gen-
der (x2 = 0.521, p = 0.470), type of schooling (x2 = 3.482, p = 0.323),
baseline frequency of alcohol consumption (t = 0.982, p = 0.329),
binge drinking (t = 0.788, p = 0.433) and drunkenness (t = −0.069,
p = 0.945). At baseline, adolescents had consumed alcohol on 2.72
and 3.43 days on average in the last 30 days in the IG and CG, respective-
ly. They reported binge drinking on 1.19 (IG) and 1.49 (CG) days and
drunkenness on 1.03 (IG) and 1.02 (CG) days.
Intervention effectiveness
Among girls, the interaction between time (baseline, t1 vs. follow-
up, t2) and group (CG vs. IG) was significant for frequency of alcohol
consumption and binge drinking (Table 2). There was no significant in-
teraction in relation to the frequency of drunkenness. The proportional
reductions and corresponding effect sizes showed no effect, a small ef-
fect and a large effect for the frequency of alcohol consumption, drunk-
enness and binge drinking, respectively, in the CG. In the IG, however,
the effect sizes for each of the alcohol consumption measures were
even much higher than the .8 threshold for large effects (see Table 2).
Among boys, there was no significant effect for any of the alcohol
consumption measures (Table 3). In both the CG and IG, there were
small and large effects for the frequency of alcohol consumption and

 drunkenness, respectively. For the frequency of binge drinking, the
effect size was just above the threshold for medium effects in the CG
and just below it in the IG.
Discussion
The aim of this study was to develop and test the effectiveness of a
drinking-motive-tailored intervention for alcohol-intoxicated adoles-
cents admitted to hospital emergency rooms. The results showed a re-
duction in most alcohol consumption measures among girls and boys
in both the CG and IG. It appears that the experience of a hospitalization
due to acute alcohol intoxication together with a psychosocial interven-
tion already prevents risky drinking behaviors four weeks later.
Over and above this general effect, girls who received a motive-
tailored psychosocial intervention reported a lower drinking frequency
and less binge drinking at follow-up than girls who received a non-
motive-tailored psychosocial intervention. The additional effect of the
motive-tailored intervention among girls is especially remarkable as
both the CG and IG are comparable in terms of socio-demographics,
drinking behavior at baseline, the experience of hospital admission
due to intoxication and receiving a psychosocial intervention and
additional exercises via tablet PCs and the Internet. The only difference
is the motive-tailored vs. the general content of the exercises. It appears
that tailoring the exercises to the individuals’ personal drinking
motives and providing specific advice for their needs and problems
was more efficient in helping them to abstain from drinking or reduce
their drinking frequency and binge drinking in the weeks after the hos-
pital admission.
For boys, in contrast, there was no such difference. They also reduced
their alcohol consumption at follow-up but this was independent of
whether they received a motive-tailored or non-motive-tailored inter-
vention. One explanation may be that girls, who are generally more
conscientious than boys (Freudenthaler et al., 2008; Schmitt et al.,
2009), completed the exercises more conscientiously and therefore
benefited more from the specificity of the content. Another reason
may be that the alcohol consumption of girls is more affected by internal
factors such as motives whereas that of boys is more affected by exter-
nal factors such as characteristics of the social surroundings when
drinking (Koordeman et al., 2011; Thrul & Kuntsche, 2015).
Among the limitations of the study is the high non-response rate.
The hospital experience is usually unpleasant since participants feel
physically unwell due to the consequences of alcohol intoxication,
may be ashamed about the event and probably do not wish to recapitu-
late the details of this potentially traumatic experience. These may be
reasons for not completing the follow-up questionnaire weeks later,
thus resulting in a high non-response rate. Fortunately, the analytic
sample and the non-response sample were comparable in terms of
age, gender and frequency of alcohol consumption and binge drinking.
However, we have to consider a possible selection bias of adolescents
with a stronger commitment or higher motivation which violates ran-
domization and might limit the generalizability of our results. Another
limitation is the rather short follow-up period of four weeks (which
we chose so as not to further increase the non-response rate). However,
future research should aim to use longer follow-up periods by making
further efforts to minimize attrition. Among the study’s strengths is
the rather high initial sample size taking into account the small percent-
age of adolescents who are treated in hospital due to alcohol intoxica-
tion (e.g. 0.22% of all 10 to 20-year-olds were admitted to hospital due
to alcohol intoxication in the federal state of Bavaria in 2009; Wurdak
et al., 2013). Another strength is the multi-site character of the study,
it having included multiple hospitals from different regions in
Germany. It thus appears likely that the reported results apply to a
large proportion of adolescents treated for acute intoxication in
Germany.

 Conclusion
Whereas participants generally reduced their alcohol consumption
in the four weeks following hospitalization due to acute alcohol intoxi-
cation and participation in a psychosocial intervention, among girls, the
reduction was more pronounced when the intervention was conducted
in accordance with their needs as determined by their drinking motives
expressed at baseline compared to the non-motive-tailored interven-
tion. Since this effect was not observed in boys, further research should
investigate ways to better tailor this intervention to the needs of boys
admitted to hospital due to acute alcohol intoxication.
