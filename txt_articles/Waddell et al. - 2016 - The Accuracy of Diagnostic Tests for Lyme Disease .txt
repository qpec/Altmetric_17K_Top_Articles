Abstract
There has been an increasing incidence of Lyme disease (LD) in Canada and the United
States corresponding to the expanding range of the Ixodes tick vector and Lyme disease
agent (Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto). There are many diagnostic tests for LD available
in North America, all of which have some performance issues, and physicians are con-
cerned about the appropriate use and interpretation of these tests. The objective of this sys-
tematic review is to summarize the North American evidence on the accuracy of diagnostic
tests and test regimes at various stages of LD. Included in the review are 48 studies on diag-
nostic tests used in North America published since 1995. Thirteen studies examined a two-
tier serological test protocol vs. clinical diagnosis, 24 studies examined single assays vs.
clinical diagnosis, 9 studies examined single immunoblot vs. clinical diagnosis, 7 studies
compared culture or PCR direct detection methods vs. clinical diagnosis, 22 studies com-
pared two or more tests with each other and 8 studies compared a two-tiered serological
test protocol to another test. Recent studies examining the sensitivity and specificity of vari-
ous test protocols noted that the Immunetics® C6 B. burgdorferi ELISA™ and the two tier
approach have superior specificity compared to proposed replacements, and the CDC rec-
ommended western blot algorithm has equivalent or superior specificity over other proposed
test algorithms. There is a dramatic increase in test sensitivity with progression of B. burg-
dorferi infection from early to late LD. Direct detection methods, culture and PCR of tissue or
blood samples were not as sensitive or timely compared to serological testing. It was also
noted that there are a large number of both commercial (n = 42) and in-house developed
tests used by private laboratories which have not been evaluated in the primary literature.

 Introduction
Lyme disease (LD) is the most common tick-borne infection in North America [1,2]. It was
first publically recognized in the United States in 1975 in the towns of Lyme and Old Lyme
Connecticut as a result of an investigation into 51 cases (39 children) with a similar form of
arthritis, although the first case was describe five years earlier by a dermatologist in Wisconsin
[3,4]. In North America early signs of infection may include erythema migrans (EM, a charac-
teristic skin rash that often has a bulls eye appearance) and fever and non-specific symptoms
like headache and lethargy [5,6]. If untreated, the disease can progress to disseminated LD
with neurological, cardiac and arthritic manifestations [7]. Lyme disease in North America is
caused by Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto (hereafter called B. burgdorferi) and recently Borre-
lia mayonii was identified and may be responsible for a proportion of cases, however the per-
formance of LD diagnostic tests to identify B. mayonii infection is not available [8]. In Europe
B. afzelii, B. garinii, B. burgdorferi, B. spielmanii, B. bissettii and B. bavariensis cause disease
with a wider variety of symptoms than reported in North America; a number of genospecies
including B garinii occur in Asia.
Ticks of the genus Ixodes transmit the spirochete when they feed. Ixodes scapularis, the
blacklegged tick, is the main vector in northeastern and upper midwestern United States and
Canada while I. pacificus is the major vector in western United States and western Canada
[9,10]. The primary vectors of LD in Europe and Asia are I. ricinus and I. persulcatus respec-
tively [6,11]. The principal natural hosts of immature stages of the ticks and B. burgdorferi
include rodents, other small and medium sized mammals, reptiles and birds, while adult
female ticks feed mainly on deer [12].
Lyme disease incidence has increased since 1975 as the tick vectors have expanded their
geographic range across the north eastern and upper mid-western states in the US and more
recently into Canada [2,13]. Range and spread of ticks and B. burgdorferi is facilitated by
migratory birds and terrestrial hosts [14]. There is increasing evidence that climate change
will result in further northward expansion of the tick vector’s range in Canada, resulting in
increased future risk of LD among Canadians [15,16].
The diagnostic tests available for confirmation of human LD have variable sensitivity and
specificity depending on the stage of infection, thus it is important to monitor the literature on
available tests for LD to promote those tests that perform the most effectively and address con-
cerns about the performance of non-validated tests and test protocols using evidence-informed
strategies for decision making [17,18]. Currently in Canada and the United States, a two-tiered
serology protocol is the only validated diagnostic approach for LD diagnosis recommended by
United States CDC and the Public Health Agency of Canada [17,18]. This two-tiered test is
typically an enzyme immunoassay (EIA) to detect IgM or IgG antibodies to B. burgdoferi in
serum and if the sample is positive or equivocal on the screening assay, then a western blot is
used to detect serum IgM or IgG antibodies to B. burgdorferi. Use of IgM testing is recom-
mended during the first 30 days of infection, after which only IgG tests should be used. Cur-
rently, only serology tests have been licensed for use by the FDA and the Health Canada
Medical Devices Branch (HC) for LD testing [19,20]. Other direct detection tests such as PCR
may be commercially available, but they have not been licensed for use by a governing body.
There are a number of commercial EIA kits that are licensed by the FDA and/or HC and use
either whole cell preparation of B. burgdorferi and/or purified recombinant or chimeric anti-
gens (see S2 Text). Other EIAs reported in the literature have been developed within the
reporting laboratory and have not been commercialized or under-gone licensing and will be
referred to as in-house developed tests [21,22]. The EIA’s have good sensitivity after 30 days
of infection, but typically suffer from lower specificity [22]. In 1995, the Centers for Disease

 Control and Prevention (CDC) adopted criteria for interpreting the results of the western blot
for LD and most commercialized tests follow these guidelines [23].
The objective of this systematic review is to summarize the North American evidence on
the accuracy of diagnostic tests and test regimes used to diagnose LD in patients presenting
with clinical symptoms in North America at various stages of disease and to address the ques-
tion of whether there is evidence of superior, equivalent or poor performance by the commer-
cial (approved by the FDA and/or HC) and in house laboratory tests captured in this review.
To the best of our knowledge this systematic review is a significant update to Dumler (2001)
[24] and is complementary to a recent systematic review on European Lyme disease diagnostic
tests [25].
Methods
Scoping review
This systematic review was preceded by a scoping review conducted by Greig et al (2016) to
identify, classify and characterise what is the current state of scientific knowledge on surveil-
lance methods, prevention and control strategies, diagnostic tests, risk factors, and societal atti-
tudes and perceptions towards LD in humans and B. burgdorferi in tick vectors and vertebrate
reservoirs [26]. Briefly, the scoping review methodology was designed to characterise the pri-
mary literature on LD in humans or B. burgdorferi tick vectors or reservoirs, thus studies not
on LD or B. burgdorferi were excluded from the scoping review. Additionally, the primary
research had to address one of the following topics: surveillance/monitoring, prevalence, inci-
dence, societal attitudes and perceptions in North America and global prevention and control
strategies, diagnosis and risk factors. Research on clinical LD and treatment were considered
outside the scope of this review. Each relevant paper was classified by purpose, study design,
location of the study, B. burgdorferi, host species investigated, vector species investigated, sam-
pling dates, diagnostic tests used, and whether the paper contained extractable data.
The scoping review search strategy was developed and pretested by three individuals
with extensive experience in knowledge synthesis, zoonotic diseases and library science. The fol-
lowing search algorithm was implemented in eight bibliographic databases: BIOSIS (via web of
knowledge), CAB abstracts, Scopus, PubMed, PsycINFO, APA PsycNet, Sociological Abstracts,
and EconLit with no limitation on the search, this was followed by a comprehensive search for
grey literature [26]: (lyme OR borrelia) AND ("host" OR sentinel OR landscaping OR "vector"
OR "vectors" OR "monitor" OR "monitoring" OR surveillance OR reservoir OR reservoirs OR
prevalence OR educate OR education OR barrier OR barriers OR intervene OR intervention
OR incidence OR rate OR prevent OR prevention OR control OR risk OR risks OR attitude OR
attitudes OR perception OR perceptions OR diagnostic). The search was conducted September
13th-14th, 2013 and no update of the search has been performed as analysis indicated the find-
ings would not change with the addition of new papers, thus the resources required to conduct
the update were not prioritized. The protocol for the scoping review is available upon request.
Systematic review methods
Studies identified in the scoping review that evaluated diagnostic tests for humans were fully
evaluated in this systematic review. The systematic review tools include a confirmation of rele-
vance, location of study, availability of extractable data and a quality assessment form based on
the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS-2) tool [27–29]. This tool
assesses the risk of bias and other methodological quality domains to evaluate the extent to
which the results of each study or group of studies could be biased. The QUADAS-2 tool
assessed the four quality domains (Table 1) with respect to patient selection, the diagnostic

 tests used, the reference standard and flow and timing of the study [28]. An additional section
was added to evaluate comparison tests and capture the presence of funding bias [30,31].
The data extraction form captured all pertinent study details and results. The systematic
review was managed in DistillerSR (Evidence Partners, Ottawa, ON, Canada) a web-based sys-
tematic review management software. Each form was completed by two reviewers working
independently and conflicts were resolved by consensus. Data were exported to Microsoft
Excel 2010 (Microsoft Corp., USA), prepared for summarization and analysed in STATA v. 13
(StataCorp., USA). The study protocol and PRISMA evaluation can be found in the supple-
mentary material (S1 Text, S3 Text).
Included papers examined the accuracy of diagnostic tests for LD in North America after
1995, and included studies that compared results of one test using a validated test panel, results
of clinical diagnosis, or a gold standard test result or investigated inter-test agreement. The

 recommendations for two-tier testing occurred in 1995, so we limited the review to studies
conducted after 1994. Studies that screened an asymptomatic population for LD were excluded
from this study. No inclusion or exclusion criteria were implemented on the type of control
group; instead it was evaluated as a source of variation between study results (heterogeneity).
The control group was usually a mix of one or more categories of healthy volunteers from
non-LD endemic or LD endemic regions, or asymptomatic blood donors. In some studies,
patients with diseases that have similar signs and symptoms to LD or have humoral responses
that overlap with LD and are known to cross-react (e.g. rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus
erythematosus, syphilis, autoimmune disorders, leptospirosis, periodontitis, relapsing fever,
tularemia, Southern Tick-associated Rash Illness (STARI), multiple sclerosis, and Epstein-Barr
virus infection) were included as controls to more precisely define test specificity. Studies
often used well-defined samples from serum repositories or panels, like those developed by
CDC [32], a research institute [33,34] or a commercial company [35]. These results were
included in this systematic review and the impact of patient-based or panel samples on the out-
come was investigated.
For this review the stages of LD are as follows: Early / acute LD (stage 1) is defined as those
patients presenting with EM and/or associated manifestations that have experienced signs
and symptoms of LD for less than 30 days [7]. Stage 2 illness is early disseminated LD, which
includes manifestations of early neurological LD, cardiac LD and multiple EMs [36]. Stage 3
is late LD, typically with manifestations of Lyme arthritis and late neurological LD [36]. Those
patients tested after antibiotic therapy are described as convalescent with the stage of LD
assigned prior to treatment. Post treatment Lyme syndrome is defined as a condition where
despite treatment the patient continues to experience illness [37]. “Chronic LD” is a condition
that is not recognised as being caused by B. burgdorferi by most infectious disease experts, occurs
in patients exhibiting non-specific illness who do not test positive on Food and Drug Adminis-
tration (FDA) approved serological tests, so these have been excluded from this review [38].
Meta-Analytic Methods
The dataset was managed in MS excel; each line of data represents a single test accuracy out-
come and one study may have several comparisons, thus several lines of data. Each comparison
was extracted, grouped and coded according to tests and type of outcome reported. When
there were four or more lines of data for a category, meta-analysis was conducted using hierar-
chical logistic regression and bivariate models in Stata 13 using Metandi and Midas command
packages. These models have been designed to account for the correlation between sensitivity
and specificity [39] and they overcome the often violated assumptions of a linear regression
model [40,41]. These hierarchical models use 2x2 cell counts to compute log transformations
of proportions for the analysis [39]. Without covariates, the hierarchical summary receiver
operating characteristic (HSROC) and bivariate models are equivalent although their assump-
tions are different: HSROC assumes there is an underlying Receiver-Operating Characteristic
(ROC) for each study and the bivariate model directly models the log-odds transformed sensi-
tivity and specificity assuming a bivariate normal distribution between studies [42].
Meta-analytic statistical summaries of sensitivity, specificity, likelihood ratios and diagnos-
tic odds ratio have been summarized where possible in the tables. Model diagnostics including
goodness of fit, normality, influential and outlying points, publication bias and heterogeneity
were examined where possible. Publication bias was not evaluated when heterogeneity was
>60% or there were less than 10 lines of data. Meta-regression using the bivariate model was
used to examine whether predetermined covariates explain some of the between-study varia-
tion given there was sufficient data to fit the model (>10 data lines per covariate).

 Results
In the scoping review, 485 articles focused on diagnosis of LD in humans globally and were fur-
ther evaluated for inclusion in this systematic-review meta-analysis. The decision tree for selec-
tion of articles and reasons for exclusion of potentially relevant studies in this systematic review
is shown in Fig 1. Forty-eight relevant diagnostic test evaluations conducted in North America
between 1995 and 2013 were included in this systematic review (see S2 Text and S1 Dataset).
The QUADAS-2 tool results, Table 1, indicated that there was an unclear risk of bias in
84% of studies, meaning the study received an unclear or high risk of bias score on one or
more domains (see S1 Dataset). No studies were excluded from the analysis based on their

 QUADAS assessment. In two studies it was apparent that the sample population was not
appropriately enrolled in the study as the case population and control population were
enrolled at different times and places, which could lead to biased (exaggerated) results for test
accuracy [43,44]. Appropriate blinding was often not addressed in many papers and unex-
plained exclusion of observations from the analysis was another common reporting issue.
Many of the studies (28.6%) had authors employed by or funded by commercial companies
that supplied one or more of the tests evaluated. In four of these studies the risk of funding
bias was identified to be very high [43,45–47].
The diagnostic accuracy of tests compared to clinical diagnosis
Two-tier serological test vs. clinical diagnosis.
Thirteen studies evaluated the two-tier
serological test protocol for diagnosis of LD at different stages of disease and after antibiotic
therapy. Table 2 provides the meta-analytic summaries demonstrating low sensitivity, 46.3%
(95%CI 39.1–53.7), for early (stage 1) LD patients and increasing sensitivity with stage 2,
89.7% (78.3–95.4), and stage 3, 99.4%H (95.7–99.9) LD. There was relatively high specificity
(98.3%–99.9%) across control groups. Most false positives within the control groups were
patients with diseases known to produce antibodies that cross-react in serological tests for B.
burgdorferi. Nine studies (14 lines of data) presented results for two-tier serological testing
where at least one of the tests was not FDA licensed (designed in house by the reporting labo-
ratory), Table 2. Heterogeneity analysis of sensitivity and specificity on the impact of using
non-commercial tests was not significant. At the early stage of LD the two-tier testing method
was good for ruling in LD if the patient tested positive, but had very poor predictive value for
ruling out LD, which is why it is recommended to retest after 30 days [21]. However, for con-
valescent patients treated at stage 1 LD sensitivity remained low even after 30 days.
EIA vs. clinical diagnosis.
First tier serological tests including enzyme-linked immuno-
sorbent assays (ELISA) and other serological assays were evaluated in 23 studies (119 lines of
data) with well-defined and whole cell targets, Table 3. There were a mix of FDA-licensed tests
and in house tests. Similar to the two-tiered tests, test performance for patients with stage 1 LD
was highly variable and had poor sensitivity. In later stages of LD, the sensitivity improved.
The overall specificity varied by test and between studies more than was reported for the two-
tier tests.
ELISA performance on early stage 1 LD was investigated in 53 lines of data (16 studies),
Table 3. These were further grouped by type of ELISA to understand where variation between
studies was occurring. ELISAs targeting C6 included 4 lines (3 studies) on the Immunetics1
C6 B. burgdorferi ELISA™ kit and seven lines (four studies) on unlicensed C6 ELISAs (Table 3).
Accounting for whether the C6 ELISA was licensed explained 27% of the heterogeneity between
studies and indicated the commercial ELISAs had an insignificant higher sensitivity 91(81–100)
vs. 64(47–80) and similar specificity 97(94–100) vs. 97(95–99) over all stages of LD.
Whole cell sonicate (WCS) ELISAs for early LD included 10 lines from 6 studies Table 3.
Three commercial test kits were included; Lyme Stat Test Kit, VIDAS Lyme Screen II and
Wampole Bb ELISA test system (see S2 Text) across six lines and three studies. These per-
formed differently than the four in house WCS ELISAs and the authors did not offer an expla-
nation for the divergent results.
Recombinant proteins and/or chimeric proteins from Osp A-F (mainly A and C) targets
were used to develop assays and tested on early LD patients. All studies were based on in house
ELISAs with small sample sizes and the reported sensitivities varied from target to target
ranging from 0–86%. Other assays included the use of Poly-ethylene Glycol (PEG)-peptide
conjugates in an ELISA that reported 100% sensitivity and specificity on a small sample [49].

 An indirect hemagglutination antibody (IHA) test using B. burgdorferi strains B31 and B126
had a low sensitivity 46–48% and a specificity of 98–99% which is comparable to other tests for
early LD [50].
For assays used in cases of late LD, the sensitivity and specificity were higher and more
consistent compared early LD results. A meta-regression controlling for test in the late LD cat-
egory showed the Immunetics1 C6 B. burgdorferi ELISA™ significantly out-performed (sensi-
tivity and specificity p�0.001) in house C6 ELISAs, the commercial WCS ELISAs (VIDAS
Lyme Screen II and Wampole Bb (IgG/IgM) ELISA test system) and the in house ELISAs
using various recombinant/ chimeric Osp targets, Table 3.
Not included in the meta-analyses in Table 3 was an evaluation of the reactivity of individu-
als previously vaccinated with the Osp A vaccine (removed from use in 2002); the results
showed a 95% false positive rate with a WCS ELISA and a 5% false positive rate with a recom-
binant Osp A ELISA [51].
Immunoblots vs. clinical diagnosis.
Across nine studies several commercial western
blots were evaluated against clinical diagnosis of a range of LD. These included the Marblot
test strip system by MarDx1, the Boston Biomedica Inc.(BBI) B. burgdorferi western blot test
kit1, Immuno Dot Borrelia Dot Blot Test1 and Viramed Biotech B. burgdorferi B31 Vira-
blot1. Only one in house immunoblot was evaluated investigating the diagnostic sensitivity
of a few recombinant targets.

 The MarDx 1 Lyme Disease Marblot Strip test system was evaluated in four studies (7
lines of data) on select LD groups and across early to late LD groups [52–55]. A meta-regres-
sion controlling for group indicated that the test performed significantly better on late LD
patients, but whether the investigator evaluated results for IgM, IgG or both in parallel did not
significantly affect the sensitivity or specificity.
The BBI western blot was evaluated in two separate studies using the same CDC test panel,
but slightly different classification criteria; one used the BBI criteria (IgG required 3+ bands of

results of the two criteria differed in sensitivity, which was 77% and 93% using CDC criteria
respectively for IgM and IgG blots, compared to 93% and 100% using the BBI criteria for IgM
and IgG, however the difference was not significant and specificity ranged from 77–99% with
a gain in sensitivity resulting in slight losses to specificity, Table 4.
The Immunodot Borrelia Dot Blot IgG/IgM test by General Biometric Inc. was examined
in one study; the results are shown in Table 4. An insignificant increasing trend in sensitivity
with disease progression was noted (stage 1 50% (95%CI 19, 87), stage 2 70% (35, 93) and stage
3 100% (63, 100) [52]. Viramed Biotech Borrellia burgdorferi B31 IgG/IgM Virablot demon-

in the published study with sensitivities ranging from 7 to 60 percent for different targets [56].
Tests for direct detection of Borrelia burgdorferiby bacterial isolation or PCR vs. clini-
cal diagnosis.
There are six studies, (13 lines of data) that examined bacterial isolation by cul-
ture and PCR detection of B. burgdorferi in a variety of human samples from cases of early and
disseminated LD [57–62]. Meta-analysis was not possible within this group of studies because
there were not enough lines of data within each detection method. The most commonly used
medium is Barbour-Stoener-Kelly (BSK) medium, which has been modified by some authors
to improve its sensitivity [63]. Three studies attempted to isolate B. burgdorferi from blood
(serum/plasma) of patients with early LD (stage 1) and the sensitivity of this approach was
27%, 71% and 94% [57–59]. With respect to the latter sensitivity, it has been suggested that lab-
oratory contamination may account for the very high sensitivity reported [64]. Two studies
reported sensitivities of 62–81% from biopsy samples of EM during early LD [59,60], although
both sample sizes were very small. Phillips et al. evaluated an “MPM” medium for detection of
B. burgdorferi in the blood of LD patients that had been previously treated, but then relapsed
[65]. They reported a sensitivity of 91.5% in these patients, however two studies were unable to
reproduce these results and both demonstrated that the BSK-H culture was superior [66,67].
Three studies (eight lines of data) were captured with information on the use of PCR to
identify B. burgdorferi in early LD [59,61,62]. Samples included blood and tissue biopsies and
each PCR targeted different primers. Eshoo et al (2012) used blood samples and multi-loci PCR
targeting eight different loci to both detect and genotype B. burgdorferi, the sensitivity was 62%
(40–79) and the specificity was 100% [61]. Liveris et al (2012) used a nested PCR on serum sam-
ples and biopsy samples with a sensitivity of 40.6 and 42.6% respectively [59]. They also imple-
mented a qPCR on plasma samples demonstrating a sensitivity of 33.8%. Two nested PCR
primer sets targeting the Osp A gene were investigated in neurological LD, both acute and late
cases using cerebral spinal fluid samples; they reported a sensitivity of 37.5–50% in acute cases
and 12.5–25% in late cases [62]. Across the direct detection studies sensitivity was low and in
most cases lower than the two-tier test regime, assays or immunoblots reported for early LD.
Inter-test comparisons.
The results of inter-test comparisons are summarised in Tables
5–7. Note that in these tables we have positive agreement and negative agreement that indicate
how well the two tests agreed to classify samples as positive or negative respectively. Thus, pos-
itive agreement is the probability that test 2 is positive if test 1 is positive and negative agree-
ment is the probability that test 2 is negative if test 1 is negative. Table 5 has comparisons
between the two-tier serological tests compared to other tests and Table 6 includes studies that
examined various assays and immunoblots for agreement.
Table 7 contains studies that looked at various samples and culture sensitivity in early LD as
well as the use of various PCRs to identify B. burgdorferi infection. In one study there was
agreement between culture of serum vs. plasma, however whole blood classified more samples
positive compared to serum resulting in little agreement [58,68]. The confirmation of B. burg-
dorferi presence in culture using qPCR both increased the sensitivity and shortened the length
of culture time before a positive result could be obtained [69]. A study examining the sensitiv-
ity of direct qPCR targeting flaB or recA genes compared to culture of 2mm EM biopsy sam-
ples showed little agreement and qPCR targeting the recA gene was more sensitive compared
to the fla B target [70].
Diagnostic Test Performance in Early Lyme disease
Testing for LD in patients exhibiting signs and symptoms of LD for less than 30 days is chal-
lenging as the performance of available test protocols is not optimal for making clinical

 decisions. This is largely due to the time required for the infected individual’s immune system
to mount a reaction. This is why researchers have explored the use of a variety of targets
including VlsE and C6 expressed after infection, Osp C and Fla B expressed by the feeding tick
to detect infection sooner [71,72]. However, cross-reactivity and genetic variability within the
targets has limited the diagnostic performance of any single target [73,74]. Thus the results of
expected sensitivities and specificities in Table 8 emphasize the importance of physician evalu-
ation and informed judgement when deciding to treat rather than rely entirely on imperfect
serological test protocols. Notable findings in the table include the higher specificity associated
with the two-tier testing method and the poor and highly variable sensitivity of serological
tests in the initial stages of disease when an individual is mounting an immune response to B.
burgdorferi.
Discussion
The 48 studies included in this analysis were all conducted in the United States from 1995
onwards. The samples included patients or historical samples where the clinical presentation
fit the diagnosis of LD. Within the results we summarized results for all stages of LD, separate
stages 1–3 LD and convalescent stages 1–3 LD to facilitate an evaluation of trends, similarities
and differences by test, stage of disease and treatment status. There were a few studies that dif-
ferentiated acute samples <7 days and early Lyme samples 7–30 days, but not enough to ana-
lyse predictive values within early LD. Similarly there were studies that used culture positive
patients exclusively, however the culture status of the patients did not significantly account for
the heterogeneity. Stage 1, 2, and 3 convalescent LD groups were sampled in a number of

 studies and are summarized separately from samples drawn pre-treatment as it is known that
there are differences in the immune response depending on the length of LD prior to treat-
ment [5,6].
In the United States it was recently estimated that less than 12% of Lyme disease tests were
for true infections [75]. The LD test results for patients who do not meet the clinical criteria
can be used to rule out LD, but a positive test is likely to be a false positive. Thus, the over use
of these assays to diagnose LD has been an on-going discussion and challenge for topic-spe-
cialists and physicians [76]. The literature summarised in this systematic review was based on
research conducted from 1995 when the CDC adopted the recommendations for two-tier test-
ing of LD acquired in North America. Their goal was to improve the specificity of LD testing
by recommending the use of a sensitive EIA followed by a more specific western blot for posi-
tive and equivocal samples [23]. Most of the research on diagnostic tests in North America
were based on serology, mainly antibody based assays detecting an immune response against
B. burgdorferi. As of May 2015 there were 42 tests approved by the FDA for use in the United
States and 22 approved by Health Canada Medical Devices Branch for use in Canada, however
only a few of these tests were evaluated in the primary literature and all the literature published
since 1995 was conducted in the United States (see S2 Text).
Recent studies examining inter-laboratory agreement and the sensitivity and specificity of
various test protocols noted that the C6 ELISA alone and the two-tier approach has superior
specificity compared to proposed replacements and the CDC-recommended western blot
algorithm has equivalent or superior specificity over other proposed test algorithms [77]. The
findings of this review are in agreement with other authors that sensitivity was highest for

 ELISAs targeting C6 and these showed less variability in test sensitivity compared to other
tests and test protocols [77]. The C6 ELISAs, particularly the commercial assays, had promis-
ing sensitivity, specificity and agreement of results with two-tier protocols, which is likely why
the Immunetics1 C6 B. burgdorferi ELISA™ has become widely used in place of some WCS
assays. Although we did not summarize results of inter-laboratory agreement studies in
this systematic review, the requirement for technical expertise and subjectivity in result

 interpretation for many LD tests, particularly western blots, contributes to poor agreement
between technicians, tests and/or laboratories [77].
Factors that affect the sensitivity and interpretation of the results include type of sample
and stage of disease in addition to possible variations in the type, target and conduct of the
diagnostic tests. In this systematic review all relevant studies examining the efficacy of serologi-
cal tests used serum samples from patients. There were no studies that employed the use of
synovial fluid or cerebrospinal fluid for diagnosis of LD with serological assays. However in
the last few years a number of studies have emerged from Europe on assays designed for cere-
brospinal fluid samples in the diagnosis of neuroborreliosis which is a more common clinical
presentation in Europe [78–80].
Throughout our results there was a positive association between duration of infection/
stage of disease and sensitivity of serological LD tests [34,47,60]. Thus, recommendations
include re-testing after 30 days if the initial serological test was done during the early (non-
disseminated) stages of infection and employing IgM assays as well as IgG assays to detect
early immune reactions [21,81]. Other sources of heterogeneity between studies may include
whether the case sampling frame included only samples from culture positive LD patients.
Similarly, the impact of type of sample, prospective vs. retrospective patients and sample
libraries or serum panels for test performance was investigated wherever possible in the analy-
sis. The control group samples in the captured studies ranged from groups of healthy individu-
als from endemic and non-endemic areas to controls with diseases known to cross-react with
LD diagnostic assays. Despite this, most studies reported a consistently high specificity for LD
regardless of the composition of the control group and where there were differences (Tables
2–4), these were not statistically significant in most cases.
There was a wide range of assays identified in this systematic review including those assays
that employed whole-cell sonicates mainly from B. burgdorferi B31 or other North American
isolates to recombinant proteins targeting antigens that are highly expressed in vivo e.g.
VlsE. Some of the captured research indicates that the VlsE targets improve test performance
[45,82]. Similarly the C6 peptide which is derived from the VlsE lipoprotein has shown equiva-
lent or better sensitivity compared to the WCS ELISAs in this systematic review, improved
specificity for patients with often cross-reactive diseases and may also be used to identify some
species of Borrelia acquired in Europe [47,73,74,82–84]. Subjectivity and inconsistency of
the criteria used to evaluate western blot results has been noted as a source of confusion for
patients and physicians in the interpretation of diagnostic results [85,86]. In studies where the
CDC western blot interpretation was paired with different criteria, some showed gains in sen-
sitivity with alternate criteria, but this was usually accompanied by a reduced specificity below
an acceptable level [46].
Direct detection of B. burgdorferi from LD patient samples continues to be a challenge. B.
burgdorferi requires culture in a complex medium for 8 to 12 weeks before the culture is con-
sidered negative, which makes this approach unsuitable in a clinical setting. Recent studies
have attempted to improve the utility of culture by changing the protocol, for example, use of a
60 ml of BSK in a closed tube, incubated at 32–33˚C for 8–12 weeks [58,59]. Another study
used 15 ml and 2 ml starter cultures, then at day six seeded a long term culture in a caliper jar
with 15 ml of fresh BSK for up to 16 weeks at 34˚C [57]. Variations that had positive effects on
culture growth included adding serum, a reducing agent and rifampicin [57–59]. The use of
PCR to confirm bacterial isolation improves the sensitivity compared to visual confirmation
by staining with acridine-orange and using dark-field microscopy or fluorescent microscopy
[69]. The specimen, stage of LD and the laboratory technician’s experience has an effect on the
likelihood of obtaining a successful B. burgdorferi culture. In early LD a biopsy sample from an
EM lesion taken within the first week of symptoms has the highest sensitivity, whereas early

 disseminated infections have a higher sensitivity if isolation is attempted on large volume
plasma samples [59,69].
Bacterial isolation has had limited success with late manifestations of LD and with cerebro-
spinal fluid and synovial fluid samples [87,88]. Research continues to focus on improving the
sensitivity and speed of culture. Recent papers claiming major breakthroughs for B. burgdorferi
isolation have failed validation [57] or could not be replicated [65] by others [64,67]. PCR for
detection of B. burgdorferi DNA in LD patient samples is affected by many of the same limita-
tions as culture with the exception that results may be obtained faster and PCR may be more
sensitive in samples with a low concentration of B. burgdorferi. The variability of methodolo-
gies, gene targets and primers from study to study continue to impact the interpretation of the
PCR results [59,61,62]. Overall, the sensitivities of PCR studies conducted in North America
were lower than those that employed a two-tiered serology diagnostic protocol [59,61,62]. Due
to the above limitations, bacterial isolation and PCR are not routinely used as diagnostic tools
in clinical practise, although bacterial isolation is considered the gold standard to confirm
diagnosis.
From the peer-reviewed literature we identified validation data from only a small propor-
tion of licensed assays and for a number of “in house” tests which are used by several laborato-
ries across North America. The performance of “in house” tests cannot be validated or
critiqued as the composition of the test is not always publically available or evaluated in the
peer-reviewed literature, thus comparing their performance to licensed tests is less informa-
tive. In studies looking at the variable performance of diagnostic testing schemes across labora-
tories it has been demonstrated that deviations from recommended diagnostic schemes often
lead to a decrease in specificity and discordant results with approved testing schemes [89].
Thus, the performance of these “in house” assays and some of the older commercial assays
have not been evaluated against well characterised panels of serum from patients with the full
spectrum of LD clinical symptoms, with appropriate numbers of healthy controls and patients
with look-alike diseases [32].
Future work on diagnostic tests for LD includes continued improvement in the sensitivity
of all tests, particularly for early LD samples and the ability to distinguish between active
infection and previous infections. On-going work into new immunoassay techniques and
combinations of antigen targets that may help inform disease stage will hopefully improve LD
diagnostics in the future [60,79,90]. Development of point-of care tests that do not require
highly specialized technical skills and subjective interpretation of the results would help
address some of the criticisms of immunoblot techniques. This systematic review summarizes
research in North America on the accuracy of diagnostic tests for LD conducted since 1995.
The performance of the commercially available Immunetics1 C6 B. burgdorferi ELISA™
shows the most promise as a possible standalone test or as part of a two-tiered test protocol;
however it did not overcome the low sensitivity of LD diagnostic tests in patients with early
LD. Addressing this shortcoming is a significant challenge to improving LD diagnostics.
