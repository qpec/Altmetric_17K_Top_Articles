ABSTRACT
Background The association between periodontitis
and atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases (ACVD) has
been established in some modestly sized studies
(<10 000). Rarely, however, periodontitis has been
studied directly; often tooth loss or self-reported
periodontitis has been used as a proxy measure for
periodontitis. Our aim is to investigate the adjusted
association between periodontitis and ACVD among all
individuals registered in a large dental school in the
Netherlands (Academic Centre for Dentistry Amsterdam
(ACTA)).
Methods Anonymised data were extracted from the
electronic health records for all registered patients aged
>35 years (period 1998–2013). A participant was
recorded as having periodontitis based on diagnostic
and treatment codes. Any affirmative answer for
cerebrovascular accidents, angina pectoris and/or
myocardial infarction labelled a participant as having
ACVD. Other risk factors for ACVD, notably age, sex,
smoking, diabetes, hypertension, hypercholesterolaemia
and social economic status, were also extracted. Logistic
regression analyses were used to evaluate the adjusted
associations between periodontitis and ACVD.
Results 60 174 individuals were identified; 4.7% of
the periodontitis participants (455/9730) and 1.9% of
the non-periodontitis participants (962/50 444) reported
ACVD; periodontitis showed a significant association
with ACVD (OR 2.52; 95% CI 2.3 to 2.8). After
adjustment for the confounders, periodontitis remained
independently associated with ACVD (OR 1.59; 95% CI
1.39 to 1.81). With subsequent stratification for age and
sex, periodontitis remained independently associated
with ACVD.
Conclusions This cross-sectional analysis of a large
cohort in the Netherlands of 60 174 participants shows
the independent association of periodontitis with ACVD.
INTRODUCTION
Periodontitis is a complex, chronic inflammatory
disease of the tooth supporting connective tissues
and alveolar bone. It is caused by an aberrant host
response against oral and dental plaque bacteria.1 2
The host response is further compromised by
unfavourable lifestyle factors, such as smoking, and
by systemic diseases such as diabetes. If periodon-
titis is not diagnosed and treated, the chronic peri-
odontal infection may persist over many years.
There is progression in the breakdown of tissues,
and teeth may become mobile and eventually
exfoliate; 8–13% of the population suffers from
severe periodontitis.3–5
Periodontitis has been associated with athero-
sclerotic cardiovascular diseases (ACVD), a group
of ischaemic diseases that includes fatal and non-
fatal coronary heart disease (CHD; angina pectoris
(AP), myocardial infarction (MI), CHD death),
cerebrovascular accidents (CVA/stroke) and periph-
eral arterial disease.6 The causal mechanism under-
lying the association of the two diseases is unclear.7
It has been suggested that periodontitis develops
prior to any diagnosis of ACVD. In fact, chronic
infections can promote atherosclerosis, which is the
main
cause
of
cardiovascular
diseases.8–10
Periodontal lesions contain a dysbiotic bacterial
composition in the subgingival region, with out-
growth of pathogenic species; so periodontitis
could as such promote a chronic infection and bac-
teria
are
able
to
enter
into
the
circulatory
system.11–13 Short-lived bacteraemias have been
demonstrated, and different studies found peri-
odontal bacteria in atherosclerotic plaques and
biopsies.14–16 As a result of these short-lived bacter-
aemias, four subsequent sequelae have been pro-
posed: (1) a proinflammatory state, as evidenced by
increased levels of C reactive protein, other inflam-
matory markers (interleukine-6, neutrophils), (2) a
prothrombotic state, (3) the generation of auto-
immunity and (4) dyslipidaemia. Collectively, these
conditions may result in endothelial dysfunction.7
In addition, overlapping genetic factors have
been identified, which suggest that both diseases
may have a similar and perhaps parallel inflamma-
tory pathway.7 17 In addition to the latter sugges-
tion,
the
epidemiological
relationship
between
periodontitis and ACVD may occur via many
shared risk factors that commonly occur in the two
diseases: smoking, diabetes mellitus, obesity, major
depression, advanced age and male sex.6
Previous epidemiological studies, in various parts
of the world, show an increase in the relative risk
(RR) for ACVD events or ACVD-related death in
participants with periodontitis (estimated RR 1.3;
95% CI 1.0 to 1.5).18 Importantly, a significantly
higher incidence of ACVD is seen in participants
with a more severe periodontal destruction.19 For
CVA and CVA-related death, there are estimated
RRs of 1.7 (95% CI 1.2 to 2.4) and 2.1 (95% CI
1.2 to 3.9), respectively, for those with periodon-
titis.20 Stronger associations are reported for peri-
odontitis and ACVD for those under 65 years of

 age and in males; the latter National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey (NHANES) III follow-up study showed
periodontitis to be associated with ACVD and all-cause mortal-
ity in men aged 30–64 years.21 The relative contribution of the
risk factors for ACVD may vary as per continent, country and
region; for example, there is global variation in common risk
factors
such
as
smoking,
diet,
obesity
and
diabetes.
Epidemiological studies that support the association between
periodontitis and ACVD have been performed in many conti-
nents, including Asia, North and South America, and W
estern
Europe.19 22
While many studies are based on cross-sectional analyses of
cohort data, most studies report about cohorts with fewer than
10 000 participants. In addition, most studies use tooth loss or
self-reported periodontitis as a surrogate marker for periodon-
titis, and report mostly about the separate aspects of ACVD,
such as CHD, MI, CVA or death, and rarely these conditions
have been combined with overall ACVD as an outcome
parameter.
Despite the above research reports, the association between
periodontitis and ACVD is not widely known within the
medical profession. In the Netherlands, where there is a high
level of medical and dental care, epidemiological research on
this subject has not been performed yet. In our country, ACVD
accounts for 27% of total mortality.23 Although ACVD has
declined over the past decades and is no longer the leading
cause of death in the Netherlands, currently still about 730 000
persons (4.6% of the total population) are diagnosed with
CHD, among whom 120 000 have heart failure and 260 000
have atrial fibrillation. These numbers emphasise the continuous
need for dedicated research on the prevention, diagnosis and
treatment of ACVD in this country.23
The purpose of the present study is to investigate the associ-
ation between periodontitis and ACVD within the database of
the largest dental school in the Netherlands (Academic Centre
for Dentistry Amsterdam (ACTA)). Moreover, using confound-
ing adjusted multivariate and stratified analyses, we take estab-
lished risk factors for ACVD into account. W
e hypothesised that
the medical records of dental participants with periodontitis
more often include cardiovascular diseases.
METHODS
Data collection
For data collection, the electronic health record patient database
(axiUm, Exan group, Coquitlam, British Columbia, Canada) of
ACTA was used. This database contains individual records of all
the dental participants registered at ACTA from 1 January 1998
onwards; we extracted data up to 31 December 2013. To build
our database, help from the axiUm management team was
required. Anonymised data were prepared and entered into an
SPSS file (IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, V
.21.0, Armonk,
New York, USA). W
e included all participants over 35 years of
age in whom ACVD may occur; juvenile and postadolescent
forms of periodontitis are excluded.24–26 As this was a retro-
spective study, no formal consent was required.
All individuals who are enrolled as a dental participant in
ACTA are obligated to fill out a medical health questionnaire;
this is verified by interview and entered into the electronic
health record by the dental professional. This questionnaire con-
tains relevant questions about cardiovascular conditions. For all
those included, we used the entries in the medical health ques-
tionnaire to determine whether they had had suffered from
ACVD. As the purpose of the study is to investigate the associ-
ation between periodontitis and ACVD, we extracted data about
MI, CVA and AP
. A patient outcome ACVD was documented
when the presence of one or more of these conditions was
included in the medical health questionnaire of the patient.
The periodontal-diseased status of study participants was con-
firmed if at least one of the diagnostic and treatment codes for
periodontitis (also corresponding to dental care insurance
codes) was found in the electronic health record database.
Periodontitis and ACVD share several covariates which can
bias the possible association between ACVD and periodontitis.
Therefore, different covariates, notably age, sex, postal code (as
a surrogate for social economic status (SES)), smoking, diabetes,
hypertension and hypercholesterolaemia were documented on
the basis of the electronic health record database. These covari-
ates were also extracted from the electronic health patient data-
base and have been collected through the medical health
questionnaires at intake, which contains questions about several
aspects of individual background variables, including age and
sex (male 0, female 1) and current health status. Yes/no response
options are used for questions on smoking, diabetes mellitus,
hypertension and hypercholesterolaemia, and these have been
coded as bivariate covariates in the database.
Data analysis
Univariate logistic regression analyses were performed to test
for an association between ACVD and periodontitis and their
shared covariates age, sex, smoking, hypertension, hypercholes-
terolaemia and SES. Next, multivariate logistic regression ana-
lyses were performed to investigate the influence of all these
covariates on the association between ACVD and periodontitis.
No univariate a priori covariate selection was used. The covari-
ates smoking, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hypercholesterol-
aemia and sex were entered into the multivariate logistic
regression analyses as categorical (bivariate) covariates. Age at
intake has been used as a continuous variable. The relationship
between periodontitis and ACVD has been reported to be stron-
ger in males while it is reported to be absent in individuals
above 65 years of age.21 Therefore, subgroup analyses with uni-
variate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were per-
formed for the subgroups of individuals above 65 years of age
and for males.
To explore whether time and perhaps evolution in healthcare
would affect the overall results, the cohort was divided into two
equal time periods, specifically participants registered at ACTA
between 1 January 1998 and 31 December 2005, and those
registered between 1 January 2006 and 31 December 2013. All
the analyses described above were also completed for these
subgroups.
Statistical analyses and data management were performed
using SPSS.
RESULTS
Characteristics of the study population
The data were extracted from the ACTA electronic health
records (axiUm). Figure 1 is a flow chart showing how the final
study sample was obtained. Initially, the file contained 127 692
participants assigned as dental participants at ACTA in this time
period. After exclusion of participants up to 36 years of age,
67 324 participants remained. W
e included participants older
than 35 years of age. Out of these participants, 7138 partici-
pants were registered as dental participants in ACTA, but never
showed up for an intake appointment. After exclusion of these
participants, 60 186 participants remained. There were 12
records that, during verification by civil service number, were

 shown to be duplicates, so these were excluded. The final
sample contained 60 174 participants (figure 1).
The general characteristics of the study population are pre-
sented in table 1. For the total sample, the mean age at the first
visit was 51.7 (SD 10.9) years of age. The mean current age on
31 December 2013 was 59.3 (SD 11.3) years. In the total
sample, there were 32 378 women (53.8%), 27 591 men
(45.9%) and 205 individuals (0.3%) with missing data on sex.
Based on postal code, 28 490 participants (47.3%) had a low
SES (619 (1.0%) individuals with missing data on postal code).
From the total study population, 4568 participants (7.6%)
reported smoking, 1707 participants (2.8%) reported suffering
from diabetes mellitus, 3327 participants (5.5%) had hyperten-
sion and 1575 participants (2.6%) had hypercholesterolaemia.
Thus, the total number of participants with missing data
(only for sex and postal code; for 2 participants, both para-
meters were missing) was 822 (1.4%).
Cross-sectional analysis: association of periodontitis with ACVD
The study population consisted of 9730 periodontitis partici-
pants
(16.2%)
and
50 444
non-periodontitis
participants
(83.8%). In the group of periodontitis participants, 455 (4.7%)
were suffering from ACVD, whereas 9275 (95.3%) were not. In
the non-periodontitis group, 962 participants (1.9%) were suf-
fering from ACVD whereas 49 482 (98.1%) were not (figure 1).
Table 2 shows the results from the univariate and multivariate
logistic regression analyses for the association of periodontitis
status (yes/no) with ACVD (yes/no) in the total sample (with
and without adjustment for covariates), and in subgroups for
age (65 years of age or under; over 65 years) and sex.

 The results show a significant association between periodontitis
and ACVD in the total sample (unadjusted OR 2.52; 95% CI
2.25 to 2.82). Subsequently, applying a full model including all
covariates (sex, SES, age at intake, smoking, diabetes mellitus,
hypertension, hypercholesterolaemia), it was shown that there is
an independent association between periodontitis and ACVD
(adjusted OR 1.59; 95% CI 1.39 to 1.81). The other covariates,
except low SES, showed also a significant association with
ACVD in the univariate and the multivariate logistic regression
analyses (table 2).
After stratification for age and sex, a significant univariate
association
was
found
between
periodontitis
and
ACVD
(adjusted OR ≤65 years 2.80; 95% CI 2.47 to 3.17; male 2.40;
95% CI 2.08 to 2.78). Adjustment for the aforementioned cov-
ariates showed periodontitis still to be significantly associated
with ACVD (adjusted OR ≤65 years 1.48; 95% CI 1.28 to
1.70; male 1.61; 95% CI 1.36 to 1.91; table 2).
Hypertension, hypercholesterolaemia and smoking showed
the strongest associations with ACVD (table 2). Interestingly, it
should be noted that the strength of the association with ACVD
for periodontitis, age, male sex, smoking and low SES remained
fairly stable after covariate adjustment, while the strength of the
association for diabetes mellitus, hypertension and hypercholes-
terolaemia
reduced
considerably after covariate
adjustment
(table 2).
W
e explored the association between periodontitis and MI,
CVA or AP
. The analyses for these constituent elements of
ACVD showed significant associations between periodontitis
and MI, CVA or AP without covariate adjustments while, after
covariate adjustment, associations for MI and CVA remained
statistically significant (adjusted OR 1.60; 95% CI 1.33 to 1.92
and OR 1.55; 95% CI 1.25 to 1.92, respectively). This was not
observed for AP in the multivariate model (adjusted OR 1.21;
95% CI 0.97 to 1.49; see online supplementary tables S1–S3).
Data analyses stratified for the time periods 1998–2005 and
2006–2013 showed similar results as those of the full study
period (data not shown).
DISCUSSION
The association of periodontitis with ACVD has been found in
several countries dispersed over all continents. The association
has not been investigated in the Netherlands, a country with a
relatively high SES and high levels of health and dental care.
The
current
study
confirms
the
independent
association
between periodontitis and ACVD.
For the purpose of the study, all individuals above 35 years of
age in whom ACVD may start were included from a large single-
centre cohort in the largest dental school in the Netherlands,
while juvenile and postadolescent forms of periodontitis were
excluded.24–26 Periodontitis was shown to be significantly asso-
ciated with ACVD (unadjusted OR 2.52; 95% CI 2.25 to 2.82).
After adjustment for known ACVD risk factors (male, SES, age,
smoking,
diabetes
mellitus,
hypertension,
hypercholesterol-
aemia), periodontitis showed a statistically significant and inde-
pendent association with ACVD (adjusted OR 1.59; 95% CI
1.39 to 1.81). However, compared with other known risk
factors for ACVD, notably hypertension, hypercholesterolaemia
and smoking, the association of periodontitis with ACVD is
modest. For these latter three traditional risk factors, adjusted
ORs in the current study were 5.56, 4.61, 2.96, respectively. Of
importance is that the current prevalence of periodontitis
(16.2%) is comparable to prevalence estimates of severe peri-
odontitis worldwide and within this dental school, a large over-
representation of severe periodontitis is not found.3–5
According to Xu and Lu, the association between periodon-
titis and ACVD is stronger in the category up to 65 years of age
and no association was found in the category above 65 years of
age. They also showed a stronger association in males compared
with females.21 Therefore, we stratified the cohort by age and
sex, and found a stronger association in participants above
65 years of age and a less strong, but still significant, association
in participants up to 65 years of age (table 2). Thus, we were
unable to corroborate the results reported by Xu and Lu.
However, in the subgroup stratified for sex, we found a stronger
association between periodontitis and ACVD in men, which cor-
roborates previous findings.21
When interpreting our findings, the following points need
consideration. First, an important strength of this study is the
successful inclusion of 60 174 participants in our data analyses.
The majority of studies on the association between periodontitis
and ACVD included fewer than 10 000 participants. The
number of missing data was rather low: there were missing data
for only 1.4% of the records (n=822). Given the sparse amount
of missing data, we decided not to impute because we consid-
ered it unlikely that these missing data impacted the validity of
the outcome of our complete case multivariate logistic regres-
sion analyses (n=59 352).
Second, we used periodontal diagnosis and treatment codes
for defining periodontitis, which were clinically validated by
dental professionals. The data were derived from the electronic

 patient database. The dental students and dentists working at
ACTA are obligated to enter each specific treatment code when
a specific diagnosis or treatment of periodontitis is performed;
this is needed (1) for billing or insurance claims, and (2) for
study points. These restricted codes are in fact insurance codes
and non-modifiable; these are used nationwide as prescribed by
the government and insurance companies, and have been in use
since 1998. Erroneous coding is highly unlikely, as then the
billing to the patient or insurance company will be false. Dental
students are also monitored and evaluated by their supervisors
to make sure the correct code is used. Most large cohort studies
use tooth loss as a surrogate marker for periodontitis or use self-
reported periodontitis as exposure data. Hung et al27 showed
self-reported tooth loss as a surrogate variable for periodontitis
in two separate cohorts of 41 407 male health professionals and
58 975 female nurses to be associated with CHD (RR male:
1.4; RR female: 1.6). Self-reported tooth loss presumably leads
to an underestimation of the true tooth loss, and therefore there
is an underestimation of the prevalence of periodontitis, and a
less strong association between periodontitis and CHD in the
latter study. Choe et al28 reported the association between tooth
loss as a surrogate variable for periodontitis and stroke in a
cohort of 867 256 participants, with higher risk of stroke in
those with more tooth loss (HR 1.2). Choe et al did not study
other major cardiovascular outcomes such as MI and AP
. As
both caries and periodontal disease can be the cause of tooth
loss, we would expect an overestimation of the prevalence of
periodontitis, and therefore an overestimation of the association
between periodontitis and ACVD.
Third, defining the presence of ACVD, smoking, diabetes
mellitus, hypertension and hypercholesterolaemia was based on
the health questionnaire and subsequent interview. This self-
reported information may not always be reliable and could
introduce bias. However, the medical health questionnaire
which was used in the current study has been validated in a mul-
ticentre trial within 10 European countries.29 Moreover, the
interview also may have contributed to accurate reporting of sys-
temic health-related issues.
Finally, due to the cross-sectional design, the current study
does not allow inferences on causal mechanisms or a temporal
relationship.
However,
previous
longitudinal
studies
have
shown that a poor periodontal condition was present before
any ACVD event occurred. Several cross-sectional epidemio-
logical studies on the relationship between periodontitis and
cardiovascular disease have been performed. Elter et al30
reported an increased risk of CHD in individuals with both
high periodontal attachment loss and high tooth loss (OR 1.5)
and edentulous individuals (OR 1.8). Individuals with a higher
extent of sites with attachment loss of at least 3 mm have an
increased risk of CVA (OR 1.3).31 Jansson and colleagues per-
formed a study in Sweden with 1393 participants. A significant
unadjusted univariate association between participants below
45 years
of
age
with
a
bone
loss
exceeding
10%
and
ACVD-related death has been reported (OR 2.7) which, after
stratification for smoking and sex, nearly doubled for smoking
males below 45 years of age (OR 4.2).32 The prevalence of
smoking (7.6%) in our study was lower than the national
average (24%). Smoking was recorded by an affirmative answer
on the medical health questionnaire and verified by interview.
There was no means to validate ‘non-smoking’ with a breath
or blood test, and we could not further address this issue.
Obesity has been shown to be an independent risk factor for
ACVD.33 The covariates body weight (or body mass index),
diet and exercise are common life style variables that are
considered
risk
indicators
for
periodontitis
and
ACVD.6
Unfortunately, these were not systematically registered in the
electronic health database. Hence, during the analyses we were
unable to control for these potential confounding variables.
Nevertheless, we have adjusted for seven confounders (sex,
SES, age at intake, smoking, diabetes mellitus, hypertension,
hypercholesterolaemia). Therefore, it was expected that there
was not a large additional impact of other potential confoun-
ders on our findings. Information about ethnicity was not
recorded in the database for privacy reasons.
The study presented here is one of the largest cross-sectional
investigations to date investigating the relationship between peri-
odontitis and ACVD. According to the present study, the
medical records of dental participants with periodontitis include
ACVD more often as compared with dental participants without
periodontitis. Therefore, we conclude that periodontitis partici-
pants have an increased and independent risk for having ACVD
compared with non-periodontitis participants (OR 1.59; 95%
CI 1.39 to 1.81).
What is already known on this subject
Worldwide, cardiovascular diseases are a leading cause of
morbidity and mortality. Well-known risk factors include
hypercholesterolaemia, diabetes mellitus and smoking. The
relationship between cardiovascular diseases and periodontitis
has now been suggested for some time. Participants suffering
from myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accidents or
atherosclerosis seem to have a higher prevalence of
periodontitis. Several mechanisms are proposed for how the
association may exist, like presence of short-lived bacteraemias
due to periodontitis, increased levels of C reactive protein,
establishment of a prothrombotic state, and autoimmune
reactions. In addition, in Caucasians, there is evidence for
overlapping genetic risk factors. Collectively, these proposed
pathways are plausible, and may result in endothelial
dysfunction making participants more susceptible to
cardiovascular disease events.
What this study adds
We confirmed the independent association of cardiovascular
diseases and periodontitis in an extensive cohort of 60 174
dental participants of a large dental school in the Netherlands,
a country with a relatively high social economic status and high
levels of health and dental care. After correction for the known
risk factors for cardiovascular diseases (age, sex, smoking,
diabetes, hypertension, hypercholesterolaemia, social economic
status), we observed periodontitis to be highly significantly
associated with cardiovascular diseases (OR 1.6, 95% CI 1.4 to
1.8). Hypertension showed the strongest adjusted association
with cardiovascular diseases (OR 5.6, 95% CI 4.9 to 6.4). This is
the first large-scale study among dental school participants with
clear diagnostic and treatment codes specific for periodontitis,
showing the association between cardiovascular diseases and
periodontitis. Thus, along with the well-known risk factors for
cardiovascular diseases, periodontitis should also be considered
as a risk.
