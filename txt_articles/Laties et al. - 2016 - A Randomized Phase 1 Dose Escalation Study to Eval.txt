Abstract
Purpose: To investigate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of trabodenoson, a highly selective
adenosine mimetic targeting the adenosine A1 receptor.
Methods: In Part 1, 60 healthy adult volunteers were randomized to 14 days of twice-daily topical monocular
application of placebo or trabodenoson (200, 400, 800, 1,600, 2,400, or 3,200 mg). In Part 2, 10 subjects were
randomized to placebo or 8 escalating doses of bilateral trabodenoson (total daily doses: 1,800–6,400 mg).
Results: The incidence of treatment-related adverse events in Part 1 was similar in the trabodenoson (27.8%)
and placebo (25.0%) groups. Most were mild in intensity. The most common adverse events (AEs) for tra-
bodenoson and placebo were headache (25.0% vs. 33%, respectively) and eye pain (11.1% vs. 4.2%, respec-
tively). Ocular AEs were infrequent (16.7% and 17.9%, respectively), were self-limited, lasted <24 h, and were
typically mild in intensity. The most common ocular AE was eye pain (9.5% and 3.6%, respectively), with a
single observation of ocular hyperemia (200 mg trabodenoson). Trabodenoson was rapidly absorbed [median
time to maximum concentration (tmax): *0.08 to 0.27 h] and eliminated (t½: 0.48–2.0 h), with no evidence of
drug accumulation. Systemic exposure to topical trabodenoson was dose related but not dose proportional, with
a plateau effect at doses ‡2,400 mg per eye. No clinically significant treatment-related systemic AEs were
observed, and increasing systemic exposure had no effect on heart rate or blood pressure.
Conclusions: Ocular doses of trabodenoson up to 3,200 mg per eye were safe and well tolerated in the eye and
resulted in no detectable systemic effects in healthy adult volunteers.

Introduction
E
levated intraocular pressure (IOP) is an estab-
lished risk factor for the development and progression
of primary open-angle glaucoma, and reduction of IOP is
the only therapeutic intervention known to lower the risk of
developing glaucoma1,2 and slow its progression.3,4 Reduc-
tion of IOP can be achieved with medication, laser therapy, or
surgical intervention. Medications delivered as topical eye
drops are the preferred first-line therapy for the management
of ocular hypertension and primary open-angle glaucoma.
Approved medications lower IOP by reducing the rate of
aqueous humor production within the eye or increasing the
rate of aqueous humor egress from the eye.
Many patients with ocular hypertension or glaucoma re-
quire more than 1 medication in an effort to achieve a target
IOP reduction.5 Following a period of innovation in the
1990s with the introduction of topical carbonic anhydrase
inhibitors, alpha-adrenergic agonists, and prostaglandin an-
alogs into the US marketplace, no novel IOP-lowering drug

 class has obtained regulatory approval in the United States.
An unmet need remains for a medication with a novel
mechanism of action that complements the actions of
available therapies. As existing therapies are not devoid of
side effects, an ideal drug candidate would have an excellent
safety profile (ocular and systemic) 1) to facilitate its use as
a first-line monotherapy, 2) to be safely added to existing
medical therapies to further reduce IOP, and/or 3) to be
combined with another medical therapy in a fixed dose
combination without significant added side effects.
Adenosine is a naturally occurring purine nucleoside that
modulates many physiologic processes. Cellular signaling by
adenosine occurs through 4 known adenosine receptor sub-
types (A1, A2A, A2B, and A3). Accumulating evidence has
begun to clarify the role of adenosine and its receptors in
modulating IOP.6,7 Selective A1 receptor agonism has been
shown to lower IOP in mouse, rabbit, monkey, and cat animal
models,7–12 while selective agonism of A2A and A3 receptors
and nonselective adenosine mimetics can elevate IOP.7 Ele-
vated endogenous adenosine concentrations in the aqueous
humor of ocular hypertensive (but not normotensive) patients
suggest a local role for adenosine in IOP homeostasis,13 and
the adenosine A1 receptor may be a specific target for IOP
modulation in ocular hypertension and glaucoma patients.
Trabodenoson is an adenosine mimetic that has a high
affinity (Ki = *1 nM) and specificity for the adenosine A1
receptor. A topical ophthalmic formulation of trabodenoson
is in clinical development for the reduction of elevated IOP
in patients with ocular hypertension or primary open-angle
glaucoma. In this article, we present the results of a Phase 1
clinical trial to assess the tolerability and safety of trabo-
denoson in healthy adult subjects.
Methods
This was a randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled
dose escalation study designed to characterize the systemic
and local ocular safety and tolerability of trabodenoson
delivered via topical ophthalmic dosing. The study was reg-
istered (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01123772) and was
conducted in accordance with the Good Clinical Practices and
the Declaration of Helsinki. The study was conducted at a
single site (Covance Clinical Research Unit, Evansville, IN).
The protocol was approved by the site’s Institutional Review
Board, and all subjects provided written informed consent.
Subjects
The study was conducted in 2 parts. In Part 1, 60 subjects
were sequentially enrolled into 6 cohorts of 10 subjects each
(Cohorts 1–6), and in Part 2, 10 subjects were enrolled in a
single cohort (Cohort 7). Subjects were healthy volunteers
aged 35–65 years, with a body weight range of 50–115 kg.
Key exclusion criteria include best-corrected visual acuity
(BCVA) below 20/60 in either eye, any active eye disease,
narrow or closed anterior chamber angles, history of central
retinal vein occlusion, visual field loss, or ocular surgery or
trauma, pregnancy, significant systemic disease (including
renal disease, cardiac disease excluding controlled systemic
hypertension, asthma, or chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease), and current or recent use of certain medications
(calcium channel blockers, beta-blockers, sympathomimet-
ics, oral carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, dipyridamole or
other adenosine antagonists, or any experimental agents).
Enrollment and randomization
All subjects attended a screening visit during which
eligibility was evaluated via a comprehensive review of
medical history and an ophthalmological examination.
Subjects were enrolled into the 7 cohorts of 10 subjects each
and were randomized in a 3:2 ratio of trabodenoson:placebo
using a permuted block strategy to ensure that each of the
cohorts included 6 subjects receiving active drug and 4 re-
ceiving placebo. This randomization scheme was chosen to
increase the number of actively treated subjects while still
maintaining an appropriate control number to clearly un-
derstand the safety profile of trabodenoson.
Treatments
Subjects randomized to active treatment received topical
ophthalmic trabodenoson in doses varying from 200 to
3,200 mg per dose. Subjects randomized to placebo received
the trabodenoson vehicle. Subjects in Cohorts 1–6 (Part 1)
received unilateral dosing in the study eye twice daily for
14 days, with doses beginning at 200 mg for Cohort 1 and
400, 800, 1,600, 2,400, and 3,200 mg, respectively, for Co-
horts 2–6. Subjects assigned to Cohort 7 (Part 2) received
bilateral topical trabodenoson once daily beginning at
200 mg in 1 eye and 1,600 mg in the fellow eye (200/1,600)
on Day 1 and every other day thereafter with dose escalation,
if tolerated, every other day as follows: 400/1,600 on Day 3,
800/1,600 on Day 5, 1,600/1,600 on Day 7, 2,400/1,600 on
Day 9, 2,400/2,400 on Day 11, 3,200/2,400 on Day 13, and
3,200/3,200 on Day 15, the highest single-eye dose from
Part 1. On days when the doses were unequal, the right
eye received the higher dose. Prespecified stopping rules—
incorporating clinical, laboratory, and cardiac data—governed
the continuation of the study from one dose to the next in
both Parts 1 and 2.
Schedule of visits
The study schedule included a screening visit, a 2-day
inpatient pretreatment baseline assessment period (during
which a placebo run-in was initiated), a 14-day (Cohorts 1–
6) or 15-day (Cohort 7) inpatient treatment period, and a 6-
day (Cohorts 1–6) or 5-day (Cohort 7) postdosing outpatient
observation period.
Assessments
The safety and tolerability of trabodenoson were assessed
on the basis of both clinical findings and adverse event (AE)
monitoring conducted during the pretreatment baseline pe-
riod and at selected time points during the treatment period.
AEs were categorized by System Organ Class (SOC) and
Preferred Terms using the Medical Dictionary for Reg-
ulatory Activities (MedDRA, version 13). All AEs were gra-
ded by severity (mild, moderate, and severe) and likely causal
relationship to the study drug (possibly, probably, and def-
initely).
Systemic safety assessments included physical examina-
tions, vital signs, and orthostatic blood pressure, and clinical
laboratory tests included complete blood counts and blood
chemistry assessments as well as renal, hepatic, and cardiac
biomarkers and urinalysis. Specific cardiovascular safety
assessments included 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs),

 48-h cardiac Holter monitoring, cardiac rhythm strips, con-
tinuous multilead cardiac telemetry monitoring, and troponin
levels. The ECG and Holter monitoring data were centrally
read in a masked manner (ERT, Philadelphia, PA). The effect
of trabodenoson on bronchoconstriction was evaluated using
expiratory flow rates for the forced expiratory volume in the
first second (FEV1), and the effect of trabodenoson on
sleepiness, lethargy, or tiredness was assessed using the
Karolinska Sleepiness Scale.
Ocular safety assessments included BCVA, IOP, exami-
nation of the external eye (periorbital area, eyelids, eyelashes,
conjunctiva, sclera, and pupils), slit-lamp examination (eye-
lids, eyelashes, conjunctiva, cornea, sclera, pupils, iris, and
lens), and dilated (and undilated at some time points) fun-
doscopic examination. BCVA was assessed using the Early
Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) protocol.
IOP was measured using Goldmann applanation tonometry
in a masked manner.
Pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters calculated included
area under the concentration–time curve (AUC), maximum
concentration (Cmax), time to Cmax (tmax), and plasma half-
life (t½). Blood samples were collected at multiple time
points for these evaluations.
Statistical analysis
The primary objective of Part 1 of this study was to
evaluate the tolerability and safety of a 14-day topical
monocular application of twice-daily trabodenoson 200–
3,200 mg in healthy adult volunteers. Likewise, the primary
objective of Part 2 was to evaluate the medication’s toler-
ability and safety following bilateral application of esca-
lating single doses. The secondary objective included PK
analysis of both trabodenoson and its primary metabolite
(INO-2446), and the exploratory objective was to evaluate
the pharmacodynamic effects of trabodenoson on IOP in this
healthy ocular normotensive population. Statistical analysis
included descriptive statistics of subject demographics and
outcomes based on the intent-to-treat population (all sub-
jects receiving study medication). No inferential statistics
were conducted, and therefore, no formal power/sample size
calculations were performed.
Results
Demographics and disposition
Overall, 70 subjects were enrolled in this study, with 10 in
each of the 7 cohorts. Demographic and baseline charac-
teristics were generally similar across the different treatment
groups in both Part 1 and Part 2 of the study (Table 1). The
mean age across cohorts and treatment groups ranged from
45 to 52 years; 50%–83% of subjects were male, and 33%–
88% were white. Observed differences were not considered
to be clinically relevant.
In Part 1, 56 of 60 subjects completed the study. One
subject assigned to trabodenoson treatment discontinued
therapy due to increases in the liver enzymes aspartate
aminotransferase, alanine transaminase, and alkaline phos-
phatase and was subsequently diagnosed with chronic cho-
lecystitis due to cholelithiasis. Because symptoms of
recurrent right upper quadrant and right flank pain predated
study enrollment, this finding was deemed unrelated to study
drug. Three subjects assigned to placebo discontinued

 therapy. One developed a panic attack and supraventricular
tachycardia, another developed a toothache requiring dis-
charge from the research unit to seek care and one for more
extensive follow-up of abnormal ECG and cardiac telemetry
data identified during the baseline period. In Part 2, all 10
enrolled subjects completed the study.
Extent of exposure to trabodenoson
All subjects randomized to trabodenoson in Cohorts 1–6
received all scheduled administrations of study drug, with
the exception of 1 subject randomized to 2,400 mg trabo-
denoson, who was withdrawn from the study due to unre-
lated
cholecystitis. Therefore,
this cohort of subjects
received 93.2% (151/162) of scheduled administrations.
Cumulative drug exposure in Cohorts 1–6 ranged from
32,400 mg in the 200 mg Cohort 1 to 518,400 mg in the
3,200 mg cohort. Subjects in Cohort 7 received all scheduled
trabodenoson administrations for a total of 181,200 mg in the
solitary 6,400 mg cohort.
Safety results
All AEs.
The overall frequency of AEs is given in
Table 2. In Cohorts 1–6, the proportion of subjects with AEs
was higher in the placebo group (87.5%, 21/24 subjects)
than in the trabodenoson group (50.0%, 18/36 subjects).
Common AEs occurring at a rate ‡5% in Cohorts 1–6 are
presented in Table 3 and included headache, eye pain, back
pain, dermatitis, and excoriation, all of which were more
frequent in the placebo group than in the combined trabo-
denoson groups, except for eye pain (4.2% vs. 11%) and
dermatitis (0% vs. 5.6%).
The proportion of subjects with AEs in Cohort 7 (Table 3)
was lower in the placebo group (25.0%, 1/4 subjects) than in
the trabodenoson group (50.0%, 3/6 subjects). A single
subject in the placebo group experienced cheilitis (inflam-
mation of the lips), photophobia, excoriation, and pruri-
tus. In the trabodenoson group, one subject experienced
constipation at the 1,600/800 dose level; another experi-
enced headache as well as a hematoma and pain at the site
of a PK blood draw at the 1,600/200 dose level, and a
third subject experienced headache at the 3,200/2,400 dose
level.
Treatment-related AEs.
The proportion of subjects ex-
periencing treatment-related AEs was similar between the
placebo and trabodenoson groups (25.0% vs. 27.8%, re-
spectively). In the placebo group, 6 subjects experienced
6 AEs judged by the investigator to be treatment related,
including 1 case each of eye pain, eye pruritus, visual

 impairment, fatigue, acne, and papular rash. In the combined
trabodenoson groups, 10 subjects experienced 15 treatment-
related AEs, including 7 cases of headache, 4 cases of eye
pain, and 1 case each of eye pruritus, conjunctival hyper-
emia, fatigue, and rhinorrhea. All but 2 of these were graded
as mild in severity: 1 case each of headache and conjunc-
tival hyperemia, both in subjects assigned to the 200 mg
group, were graded as moderate.
In Cohort 7, only 1 subject each in the placebo and tra-
bodenoson groups (25.0% and 16.7%, respectively) experi-
enced treatment-related AEs: 1 case of headache in a subject
in the 200 mg trabodenoson group graded as mild and 1 case
of photophobia in the placebo group graded as mild. Both
resolved spontaneously without discontinuation of study
medication.
Serious AEs.
The only serious adverse event in the
study (supraventricular tachycardia) was experienced by a
subject in the placebo group who discontinued treatment.
Ocular AEs.
Ocular AEs were uncommon, lasted less
than 24 h, were self-limited, and were usually mild in in-
tensity. No ocular AE in any cohort was deemed serious by
the investigator. In Cohorts 1–6, 4 subjects (16.7%) expe-
rienced ocular AEs (1 case each of pain, pruritus, papular
rash of the eyelid, photophobia, and visual impairment)
compared to 7 subjects (16.7%) in the combined trabode-
noson groups (4 cases of eye pain and 1 case each of pru-
ritus, hordeolum, and conjunctival hyperemia). In Cohort 7,
1 subject in the placebo group experienced photophobia, and
no subjects in the trabodenoson group experienced an ocular
AE. No anterior chamber inflammation was noted in any
subject. No clinically significant changes in visual acuity
were noted in any subjects. These results are summarized in
Table 4.
Other
safety
evaluations.
No
clinically
significant
treatment-related abnormalities were observed in clinical
laboratory studies, ocular or physical examinations, pul-
monary or cardiac function tests, or sleepiness assessments
in any cohort.
PK results
The PK data demonstrated that the exposure to trabode-
noson and its main metabolite INO-2446 increased dose-
proportionally between the 200 and 800 mg dose groups,
while at higher doses, drug exposure generally increased in
a dose-dependent but not dose-proportional manner. Speci-
fically, at the highest 3 doses administered in Cohort 7, there
was no apparent increase in systemic exposure with in-
creasing topical ocular dose (Fig. 1). This plateau effect
suggests that little additional drug is absorbed into the sys-
temic circulation following doses above 4,800 mg (2,400 mg
per eye). The median tmax for trabodenoson occurred at
*0.08 to 0.27 h across all treatment cohorts, indicating ra-
pid absorption following ocular administration. The mean t½
of trabodenoson ranged from 0.48 to 2.0 h across all treat-
ment cohorts except for the 3,200 mg cohort and demon-
strated the rapid elimination from plasma following ocular
administration. Two subjects in the 3,200 mg cohort had a
longer than expected half-life of *17 h. The reason for this
finding is unknown, although a corresponding increase in
the half-life of primary metabolite INO-2446 was not ob-
served in these 2 subjects, suggesting that these data may be
aberrant. A comparison of the concentrations and exposures
for trabodenoson on Day 1 and Day 14 demonstrated a lack
of accumulation of drug in plasma following repeated ocular
administration at any dose tested. Exposure to the primary
metabolite INO-2446, as measured by Cmax and AUC,
ranged from *13% to 37% of the corresponding exposures

INO-2446 were high but similar to those for trabodenoson.
The mean t½ for INO-2446 was *0.68 to 5.0 h and was
similar across all dose groups. Increasing systemic exposure
had no effect on heart rate or blood pressure.
Discussion
This study evaluated the local and systemic safety and
tolerability of topical ophthalmic administration of trabo-
denoson in healthy adult volunteers. Escalating ocular doses
of trabodenoson far in excess of doses associated with IOP
reduction in subjects with primary open-angle glaucoma or
ocular hypertension (500 mg) were safe and well tolerated,
with no dose-limiting toxicities or treatment-related ocular
AEs, such as conjunctival hyperemia or anterior chamber
inflammation, observed. The incidence of overall AEs was
lower in the trabodenoson group (50%) than in the placebo
group (87.5%) for Cohorts 1–6 in Part 1 of the study. The
most commonly reported AEs (‡5%) in Part 1 were head-
ache, eye pain, back pain, dermatitis, and excoriation. In
Part 2 of the study, trabodenoson was associated with a
greater incidence of AEs than placebo (50% vs. 25%, re-
spectively). There was no increase in the frequency of
overall AEs with increasing dose of trabodenoson, and the
incidence of treatment-related AEs was similar between the
trabodenoson and placebo groups in both parts of the study.
Most treatment-related AEs were mild in intensity. The
most common treatment-related AEs were headache and eye
pain. AEs potentially associated with systemic adenosine,
such as chest discomfort, flushing, dyspnea, and hypoten-
sion, were not observed in this study. Overall, trabodenoson
administered via topical ophthalmic application demon-
strated favorable systemic safety at doses up to 6,400 mg
(3,200 mg per eye) per day, the highest practically achiev-
able ocular dose that required 4 consecutive drops of the
formulation in each eye, 5 min apart, at the highest drug
concentration available.
The incidence of ocular AEs was similar between tra-
bodenoson and placebo treatment groups, and these AEs
were infrequent and self-limited, and most were mild in
intensity. Only 1 trabodenoson-related AE of conjunctival
hyperemia was reported in the lowest trabodenoson treat-
ment group (200 mg); it resolved within 1 h and did not
recur with subsequent dosing. There were no serious ocular
AEs. Overall, trabodenoson demonstrated favorable ocular
safety and tolerability.
PK analysis demonstrated a dose-proportional increase in
plasma exposure up to a dose of 800 mg and dose-dependent
but not dose-proportional increases in exposure at higher
doses, with the highest systemic exposure at the 6,400 mg
per day dose level in Part 2. The plasma half-life of trabo-
denoson was generally under 2 h at all doses, and under 5 h
for its primary metabolite, demonstrating rapid plasma
clearance and no drug accumulation with repeated dosing.
This study was designed to thoroughly assess the safety,
tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of trabodenoson. How-
ever, these rigorous assessments required isolation in a
phase 1 unit, necessitating a smaller sample size. Thus, the
generalizability of these results to actual patients with
glaucoma or ocular hypertension may have limitations. A
second study evaluating similar parameters in the target
population of adults with ocular hypertension or primary
open angle glaucoma can be found in this same journal issue
(see pages XX–XX).
In summary, trabodenoson delivered via topical ophthal-
mic application at doses up to 6,400 mg per day demon-
strated favorable ocular and systemic safety and tolerability.
PK analysis indicated no accumulation with repeated dos-
ing. Additionally, a dose-related increase in plasma drug
exposure—that was less than dose proportional and plateaued
at doses above 2,400mg per eye—was observed. The profile
of this drug candidate may fulfill an unmet need in glaucoma
management by providing clinicians and patients with a
novel mechanism of action for lowering IOP that is both safe
and well tolerated. These results support continued clinical
development of trabodenoson to confirm and characterize its
safety and efficacy profile in the broader patient population,
including patients with primary open-angle glaucoma and
ocular hypertension.
