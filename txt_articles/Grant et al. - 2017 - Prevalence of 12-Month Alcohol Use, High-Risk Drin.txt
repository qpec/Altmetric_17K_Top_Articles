IMPORTANCE Lack of current and comprehensive trend data derived from a uniform, reliable,
and valid source on alcohol use, high-risk drinking, and DSM-IV alcohol use disorder (AUD)
represents a major gap in public health information.
OBJECTIVE To present nationally representative data on changes in the prevalences of
12-month alcohol use, 12-month high-risk drinking, 12-month DSM-IV AUD, 12-month DSM-IV
AUD among 12-month alcohol users, and 12-month DSM-IV AUD among 12-month high-risk
drinkers between 2001-2002 and 2012-2013.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS The study data were derived from face-to-face
interviews conducted in 2 nationally representative surveys of US adults: the National
Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions, with data collected from April 2001
to June 2002, and the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions III,
with data collected from April 2012 to June 2013. Data were analyzed in November and
December 2016.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Twelve-month alcohol use, high-risk drinking, and DSM-IV
AUD.
RESULTS The study sample included 43 093 participants in the National Epidemiologic
Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions and 36 309 participants in the National
Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions III. Between 2001-2002 and
2012-2013, 12-month alcohol use, high-risk drinking, and DSM-IV AUD increased by 11.2%,
29.9%, and 49.4%, respectively, with alcohol use increasing from 65.4% (95% CI,
64.3%-66.6%) to 72.7% (95% CI, 71.4%-73.9%), high-risk drinking increasing from 9.7%
(95% CI, 9.3%-10.2%) to 12.6% (95% CI, 12.0%-13.2%), and DSM-IV AUD increasing from
8.5% (95% CI, 8.0%-8.9%) to 12.7% (95% CI, 12.1%-13.3%). With few exceptions, increases in
alcohol use, high-risk drinking, and DSM-IV AUD between 2001-2002 and 2012-2013 were
also statistically significant across sociodemographic subgroups. Increases in all of these
outcomes were greatest among women, older adults, racial/ethnic minorities, and individuals
with lower educational level and family income. Increases were also seen for the total sample
and most sociodemographic subgroups for the prevalences of 12-month DSM-IV AUD among
12-month alcohol users from 12.9% (95% CI, 12.3%-17.5%) to 17.5% (95% CI, 16.7%-18.3%)
and 12-month DSM-IV AUD among 12-month high-risk drinkers from 46.5% (95% CI,
44.3%-48.7%) to 54.5% (95% CI, 52.7%-56.4%).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Increases in alcohol use, high-risk drinking, and DSM-IV AUD
in the US population and among subgroups, especially women, older adults, racial/ethnic
minorities, and the socioeconomically disadvantaged, constitute a public health crisis. Taken
together, these findings portend increases in many chronic comorbidities in which alcohol
use has a substantial role.

 A
lcoholuseandspecificallyhigh-riskdrinking,whichof-
ten leads to alcohol use disorder (AUD), are signifi-
cant contributors to the burden of disease in the United
States and worldwide.1-7 High-risk drinking and AUD are im-
portant risk factors for morbidity and mortality from fetal al-
cohol spectrum disorders,8 hypertension,9 cardiovascular
diseases,10-15 stroke,16 liver cirrhosis,17,18 several types of
cancer19-23 and infections,24-26 pancreatitis,27,28 type 2
diabetes,29 and various injuries.30 High-risk drinking and AUD
are disabling,31,32 are associated with numerous psychiatric
comorbidities33,34 and impaired productivity and interper-
sonal functioning, and place psychological and financial bur-
dens on society as a whole and on those who misuse alcohol,
their families, friends, and coworkers,35-37 as well as through
motor vehicle crashes, violence, and property crime.38,39
In view of the seriousness of the numerous physical and
psychiatric harms of high-risk drinking and AUD, regular and
detailed monitoring of their trends over time is imperative for
the health of the nation. Historically, reliable national survey
dataonalcoholuse,high-riskdrinking,andAUDwerenotavail-
able before the early 1970s.40 The few national trend surveys
conducted between the early 1970s to the early 1990s showed
stability or decreases in trends for 12-month alcohol use, vari-
ous measures of high-risk drinking, and social consequence
and alcohol dependence symptoms.41-44 Between the early
1990s and the early 2000s, 12-month alcohol consumption in-
creased from 44.0%45 to 65.4%,46 12-month high-risk drink-
ing increased from approximately 8.0%47,48 to 9.7%,49 and
DSM-IV50 AUD increased from 7.4%45 to 8.5%.32
Lackofcurrentandcomprehensivetrenddataderivedfrom
a uniform source on alcohol use, high-risk drinking, and
DSM-IV AUD since the early 2000s represents a major gap in
public health information. Tracking patterns of alcohol
consumption and AUD is essential to test temporal models of
alcohol consumption behaviors and alcohol-related mor-
bidity and mortality and to estimate the effectiveness of
policy changes related to alcohol use (eg, taxes and treat-
ment entitlements). Furthermore, monitoring of alcohol
consumption patterns and AUD over time within important
sociodemographic subgroups of the US population is critical
for planning and targeting prevention and intervention
programs.
Accordingly, this study presents data for 2001-2002 and
2012-2013 on the prevalences of 12-month alcohol use, high-
risk drinking (defined as exceeding the daily drinking guide-
lines at least weekly in the past 12 months), and 12-month
DSM-IV AUD overall and among important sociodemo-
graphic subgroups of the US population. We used data from
theNationalInstituteonAlcoholAbuseandAlcoholism’
s2001-
2002 Wave 1 National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and
Related Conditions (NESARC)51 and 2012-2013 NESARC-III.52
Methods
Sample
The 2012-2013 NESARC-III is a nationally representative, face-
to-face interview survey of 36 309 US adults 18 years and older
residing in households and selected group quarters,52 with re-
spondents selected through multistage probability sampling.
The data were collected from April 2012 to June 2013. Pri-
mary sampling units were counties or groups of contiguous
counties, secondary sampling units were groups of US Census–
defined blocks, and tertiary sampling units were households
within sampled secondary sampling units within which eli-
gible adult respondents were selected, with black, Asian or Pa-
cific Islander, and Hispanic individuals oversampled. The
household response rate was 72.0%, the person-level re-
sponse rate was 84.0%, and the overall response rate was
60.0%, which were comparable with other current US na-
tional surveys.53,54 Data were adjusted for oversampling and
nonresponse and were weighted to represent the US civilian
population based on the 2012 American Community Survey.55
Weighting adjustment compensated for nonresponse.52 In-
formed consent was electronically recorded, and respon-
dents received $90 for participation. The Combined Neuro-
science Institutional Review Board of the National Institutes
of Health and Westat Institutional Review Board approved the
protocol and informed consent procedures.
The 2001-2002 NESARC was a nationally representative,
face-to-face interview survey of 43 093 US adults, described
elsewhere in detail.51 The data were collected from April 2001
to June 2002. The target population was the US adult popu-
lation 18 years and older residing in households and selected
group quarters. Primary sampling units consisted of counties
or county equivalents from which eligible adults were
selected,withblackandHispanicindividuals,andyoungadults
oversampled. The sampling frame response rate was 98.5%,
the household response rate was 88.5%, and the person re-
sponseratewas93.0%,yieldinganoverallsurveyresponserate
of 81.0%. Data were adjusted for oversampling and nonre-
sponse and were weighted to represent the civilian US popu-
lation based on the 2000 Decennial Census.56 The survey pro-
tocol,includingwritteninformedconsentprocedures,received
full ethical review and approval from the US Census Bureau
and the US Office of Management and Budget.
Key Points
Question Have the 12-month prevalences of alcohol use, high-risk
drinking, and DSM-IV alcohol use disorder increased between
2001-2002 and 2012-2013?
Findings In this study of data from face-to-face interviews
conducted in 2 nationally representative surveys of US adults,
including the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and
Related Conditions (n = 43 093) and the National Epidemiologic
Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions III (n = 36 309),
12-month alcohol use (11.2%), high-risk drinking (29.9%), and
DSM-IV alcohol use disorder (49.4%) increased for the total US
population and, with few exceptions, across sociodemographic
subgroups.
Meaning Substantial increases in alcohol use, high-risk drinking,
and DSM-IV alcohol use disorder constitute a public health crisis
and portend increases in chronic disease comorbidities in the
United States, especially among women, older adults, racial/ethnic
minorities, and the socioeconomically disadvantaged.

 Assessments
The Alcohol Use Disorder and Associated Disabilities Inter-
view Schedule–DSM-IV Version (AUDADIS-IV)57 used in
NESARC and the AUDADIS Fifth Edition Version58 used in
NESARC-III assessed any 12-month alcohol use with identical
questions.ConsistentwiththeUSdietaryguidelines,59,60high-
riskdrinkingwasdefinedasdrinking4ormorestandarddrinks
(a drink equals 14 g of pure alcohol) on any day for women and
as drinking 5 or more standard drinks on any day for men. In
thisstudy,high-riskdrinkingwasdefinedasexceedingthedaily
drinking limits at least weekly during the prior 12 months.
An individual was considered to have a DSM-IV AUD di-
agnosis if the respondent met criteria for alcohol dependence
or abuse in the past 12 months. A diagnosis of dependence re-
quired 3 or more of the 7 DSM-IV dependence criteria, and a
diagnosis of abuse required 1 or more of the 4 abuse criteria.
Respondents with a 12-month abuse or dependence diagno-
sis were classified as having 12-month AUD.
Symptom items that assessed DSM-IV AUD diagnoses in
NESARC and NESARC-III were virtually identical. However, 3
items were slightly reworded, and 3 additional abuse ques-
tions appeared in NESARC-III. Comparisons between DSM-IV
12-monthAUDdiagnoseswithandwithouttheadditionalques-
tions yielded almost identical prevalences (8.5% and 8.2%, re-
spectively, for NESARC and 12.7% and 12.2%, respectively, for
NESARC-III), with near-perfect concordance (κ = 0.97 for
NESARC and κ = 0.98 for NESARC-III), which suggested that
trivial differences between AUD operationalizations were not
responsible for the changes reported herein.
The test-retest reliability and validity of AUDADIS alco-
hol use, high-risk drinking, and DSM-IV AUD diagnoses are
documented in clinical and general population national
and international studies.61-71 The reliability and validity of
alcohol use, high-risk drinking, and DSM-IV AUD and their
associated criteria scales were fair to excellent.
Statistical Analysis
Data were analyzed in November and December 2016.
Weighted cross-tabulations estimated the prevalence of alco-
holuse,high-riskdrinking,andDSM-IVAUDinthetotalsample
and in subgroups. For 2001-2002 and 2012-2013, the preva-
lences of 12-month DSM-IV AUD among 12-month alcohol us-
ers and 12-month DSM-IV AUD among 12-month high-risk
drinkers were also examined. To account for the complex
sample design of NESARC and NESARC-III, a software pro-
gram(SUDAAN,version11.0;ResearchTriangleInstitute72)was
used to produce standard errors of the prevalence estimates
for each survey. These data were used to test differences in
prevalences between the surveys using 2-sided t tests for in-
dependent samples. P < .05 indicated significant differences
in the estimates between surveys.
Results
12-Month Alcohol Use
Twelve-month alcohol use significantly increased from 65.4%
in 2001-2002 to 72.7% in 2012-2013, a relative percentage in-
crease of 11.2% (Table 1). Significant increases, seen across all
sociodemographicsubgroups,wereparticularlynotableamong
women (15.8%), racial/ethnic minorities (from 17.2% among
Hispanic to 29.1% among Asian or Pacific Islander individu-
als), adults 65 years and older (22.4%), and respondents with
lower educational level and family income (range, 11.7%-
22.3%).
12-Month High-Risk Drinking
The prevalence of 12-month high-risk drinking increased sig-
nificantly between 2001-2002 and 2012-2013 from 9.7% to
12.6% (change, 29.9%) in the total population (Table 2). Sig-
nificant increases in high-risk drinking were also seen for all
sociodemographic subgroups except Native Americans and re-
spondents residing in rural areas. Increases were most no-
table among women (57.9%), other racial/ethnic minorities
(from 40.6% among Hispanic to 62.4% among black individu-
als),adults65yearsandolder(65.2%),personspreviouslymar-
ried (widowed, divorced, or separated) (31.9%) and married or
cohabitating respondents (34.2%), those with a high school
education (42.3%) and less than a high school education
(34.7%), those earning incomes of $19 999 or less (35.1%), and
those residing in urban areas (35.1%).
12-Month DSM-IV AUD
The prevalence of 12-month DSM-IV AUD increased signifi-
cantly from 8.5% to 12.7% (change, 49.4%) in the total popu-
lation (Table 3). Significant increases in AUD were seen in all
subgroups except Native Americans and those residing in ru-
ralareas.Notableincreaseswerefoundamongwomen(83.7%),
racial/ethnicminorities(51.9%forHispanicand92.8%forblack
individuals), adults 65 years and older (106.7%), those with a

(65.9%), those living within 200% of the poverty threshold
(range,47.1%-55.8%),andthoseresidinginurbanareas(59.5%).
12-Month DSM-IV AUD Among 12-Month Alcohol Users
Twelve-monthDSM-IVAUDamong12-monthalcoholuserssig-
nificantly increased from 12.9% to 17.5% (change, 35.7%) in the
total population (Table 4). Increases were significant during
this time for all subgroups except Native Americans, respon-
dents who were previously married, and those residing in
rural areas. Notable increases were found among women
(59.8%), those who were black (55.8%), Asian or Pacific
Islander (36.2%), or Hispanic (29.5%), adults aged 45 to 64
years (61.9%) and 65 years and older (75.0%), those who
were married or cohabiting (45.1%), those who had a high

Discussion
Between 2001-2002 and 2012-2013, the 12-month preva-
lence of alcohol use increased 11.2% in the United States from
65.4% to 72.7%. High-risk drinking increased almost 30% from
9.7% to 12.6%, representing approximately 20.2 million and
29.6 million Americans, respectively. There was a 49.4% in-
crease in 12-month DSM-IV AUD during this time from 8.5%
to12.7%(representingapproximately17.6millionand29.9mil-
lion Americans, respectively), much greater than the corre-
sponding 14.8% increase in DSM-IV AUD observed between
1991-1992 (7.4%) and 2001-2002 (8.5%).73 While the preva-
lences of AUD among both 12-month alcohol users and 12-
month high-risk drinkers increased, the prevalence of AUD

 among high-risk drinkers (46.5% in 2001-2002 and 54.5% in
2012-2013) was much greater than the prevalence of AUD
among 12-month users (12.9% in 2001-2002 and 17.5% in 2012-
2013), highlighting the critical role of high-risk drinking in the
increaseinAUDbetween2001-2002and2012-2013,whichwas

associated with a much lower increase in AUD (14.9%), again
underscoring the more important influence of increases in

Increases shown in 12-month alcohol use and high-risk
drinking are consistent with other surveys during the same pe-
riod. The National Health Interview Survey showed a 6.0%
increase in 12-month alcohol use,74,75 while the National Sur-
vey on Drug Use and Health showed a 9.1% increase in 12-
month alcohol use.76,77 Trends in drinking 5 or more drinks at
least once in the past year increased 17.8% in the National

in per capita alcohol consumption based on alcohol sales data,
which rose 6.4%.79 The marked increases in high-risk drink-
ing and DSM-IV AUD between 2001-2002 and 2012-2013 also
mirror recent sharp increases in morbidity and mortality from
diseases and injuries in which alcohol use has a substantial role
or deceleration of previously seen declines. Most important,
mortality rates of all cardiovascular diseases and stroke de-
celerated between 2000-2001 and 2011-2014 after 3 decades
of decline.80,81 Morbidity and mortality rates of hypertension
increased,82,83 as did hypertensive emergencies seen in emer-
gency departments (EDs).84 Age-specific death rates of liver
cirrhosis, especially alcohol-related liver cirrhosis, rose dra-
matically between 2009 and 2013 for the first time since the
early 1970s.85 Although increases in age-adjusted rates of type
2 diabetes86,87 since 2000 have largely been attributed to more
overweightandobesity,88,89increasesinhigh-riskdrinkingdur-

vanced imaging) received.90 Mortality among alcohol-
affected drivers who were simultaneously distracted also in-
creased between 2005 and 2009 by 63%.91
Increases in high-risk drinking and AUD among women
(57.9% and 83.7%, respectively) relative to men (15.5% and
34.7%, respectively) were alarming, consistent with earlier
studies92-96 demonstrating a narrowing of the gender gap in
these drinking patterns and AUD between 1991-1992 and 2001-
2002. Greater sensitivity to adverse health effects of heavy
drinking among women are potential biological factors influ-
encing the convergence of rates between the sexes within the
context of increasing rates of high-risk drinking and AUD.97-99
Drinking norms and values have become more permissive
among women,100,101 along with increases in educational and
occupational opportunities and rising numbers of women in
the workforce,102 all of which may have contributed to in-
creased high-risk drinking and AUD in women during the past
decade. Stress associated with pursuing a career and raising a
family may lead to increases in high-risk drinking and

Between2001-2002and2012-2013,increasesinalcoholuse,
high-riskdrinking,andAUDweregenerallymuchgreateramong
minorities than among white individuals, results that are con-
sistent with substantial increases among individuals with the
lowesteducationallevelsandfamilyincomesseeninthisstudy.
Wealth inequality between minorities and whites has wid-
ened during and after the 2008 recession,123,124 possibly lead-
ingtoincreasedstressanddemoralization.Adversitiesthatdis-
proportionately affect racial/ethnic minorities include family
income and educational disparities, unemployment, residen-
tialsegregation,discrimination,decreasedaccesstohealthcare,
andincreasedstigmaassociatedwithdrinking.125-127Thesedis-
parities may have accumulated over recent years, leading to in-
creased negative coping behaviors, such as high-risk drinking
and the development of AUD.125-131 Reasons for the widening
of the racial/ethnic gap in alcohol use, high-risk drinking, and
AUD are complex, historically rooted in racial/ethnic discrimi-
nation and persistent socioeconomic disadvantage both at the
individual and community levels.132-137 Future research is war-
ranted to understand the interplay of socioeconomic, psycho-
social, cultural, and biological factors that have contributed to
the widening of the racial/ethnic gap in alcohol use, high-risk
drinking, and AUD in recent years, with particular attention to
the development of subracial/subethnic prevention and inter-
vention strategies.
Limitations and Strengths
Limitations of this study are noted. NESARC and NESARC-III
lacked biological testing for substance use. Like other na-
tional surveys,53,54 some population segments were not cov-
ered in either survey (eg, the homeless and those who are in-
carcerated), potentially leading to underestimation of alcohol
use, high-risk drinking, and DSM-IV AUD. AUDADIS interview-
ers were not clinicians, but a NESARC-III validation substudy
comparing AUDADIS and clinician diagnoses of 12-month AUD
showed similar prevalence and good concordance.68 The NE-
SARC-III response rate was acceptable (60.1%) but was lower
than that of NESARC (81.0%). Weighting that compensated for
nonresponsefacilitatedcomparisonsbetweenthesurveys.51,52
ThevalidityofincreasesshownbetweenNESARCandNESARC-
III is supported by their coherence with the other studies noted
above showing increases in alcohol-related indicators over the
same period.
These limitations are balanced by the numerous strengths
of the Wave 1 NESARC and NESARC-III, including their large
sample sizes and detailed measures of alcohol use, high-risk
drinking, and DSM-IV AUD that have been extensively tested
and validated,61-71 in addition to their rigorous epidemiologic
study methods. These 2 surveys are also unique in providing
a uniform source of alcohol information and AUD to examine
trends over time.
Conclusions
Between 2001-2002 and 2012-2013, an increase in alcohol use,
high-risk drinking, and AUD occurred in the total US popula-
tion and across almost all sociodemographic subgroups, es-
pecially women, older adults, racial/ethnic minorities, and the
socioeconomically disadvantaged. These increases consti-
tute a public health crisis that may have been overshadowed
by increases in much less prevalent substance use (mari-
juana,opiates,andheroin)138-140duringthesameperiod.Treat-
ment rates for AUD remain low (<10%)141 despite the signifi-
cant rise in high-risk drinking and AUD and the existence of a
broadspectrumofevidence-basedandeffectivebehavioraland
pharmacologicalapproaches.142-152Theresultsofthisstudycall
for a broader effort to address the individual, biological, en-
vironmental,andsocietalfactorsthatinfluencehigh-riskdrink-
ing and AUD and their considerable consequences and eco-
nomic costs to society ($250 billion)153 to improve the health,
safety, and well-being of the nation. The development of pre-
ventionandinterventionstrategiesbothatthepopulationlevel
and those targeted at high-risk subgroups of the population
identified in this study154-159 will be paramount to achieving
this goal. Most important, the findings herein highlight the ur-
gency of educating the public, policymakers, and health care
professionals about high-risk drinking and AUD,160 destigma-
tizing these conditions and encouraging those who cannot re-
duce their alcohol consumption on their own, despite sub-
stantial harm to themselves and others, to seek treatment.
