AbstrAct
Objectives
To assess the temporal change in test use in UK 
primary care and to identify tests with the greatest 
increase in use.
Design
Retrospective cohort study.
setting
UK primary care.
ParticiPants
All patients registered to UK General Practices in 
the Clinical Practice Research Datalink, 2000/1 to 
2015/16.
Main OutcOMe Measures
Temporal trends in test use, and crude and age and 
sex standardised rates of total test use and of 44 
specific tests.
results
262 974 099 tests were analysed over 71 436 331 
person years. Age and sex adjusted use increased 
by 8.5% annually (95% confidence interval 7.6% to 
9.4%); from 14 869 tests per 10 000 person years in 
2000/1 to 49 267 in 2015/16, a 3.3-fold increase. 
Patients in 2015/16 had on average five tests per 
year, compared with 1.5 in 2000/1. Test use also 
increased statistically significantly across all age 
groups, in both sexes, across all test types (laboratory, 
imaging, and miscellaneous), and 40 of the 44 tests 
that were studied specifically.
cOnclusiOn
Total test use has increased markedly over time, in 
both sexes, and across all age groups, test types 
(laboratory, imaging, and miscellaneous) and for 40 
of 44 tests specifically studied. Of the patients who 
underwent at least one test annually, the proportion 
who had more than one test increased significantly 
over time.
Introduction
The National Health Service is experiencing an 
unprecedented rise in spending.1 Since 2003, net 
expenditure has increased by more than £50bn ($65bn; 
€57bn), around an 80% rise.1 These increasing costs 
threaten the sustainability of the NHS.
Despite the substantial workload provided in 
primary care,2 few studies have explored resource use 
in this setting. No official statistics exist on one of the 
core services provided by general practitioners in the 
United Kingdom—the use of tests. One study examined 
the use of a few specific tests between 2005 and 2009 
but in a restricted population sample.3
More than 70% of clinical decisions are influenced 
by test results,4 and tests contribute substantially to 
NHS expenditure. Lord Carter’s 2006 review found that 
laboratory tests in both primary and secondary care 
account for up to £3bn of the annual NHS budget (this 
estimate includes direct and indirect (staff) costs).4 
General practice is the single largest contributor to test 
use, with almost 45% of requests for tests arising from 
primary care.4
We quantified the temporal changes in test use in UK 
general practice and identified specific tests with the 
greatest increase in use.
Methods
study population
We obtained electronic health record data from patients 
registered with general practices contributing to the 
Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) from 1 April 
2000 to 31 March 2016. The CPRD, a large database of 
anonymised electronic health records from UK primary 
care, contains patient level data covering about 7% 
of the UK population.5 The CPRD was chosen over 
other UK primary care databases because it has been 
validated extensively and is representative of the UK 
population for age, sex,5 and ethnicity.6 We included 
patients of any age if their records were acceptable for 
research purposes (a data quality indicator provided 
by CPRD) and they were registered at practices with 
continuous high quality data reporting (CPRD defined 
up to standard)7 at any time during the study period.
included tests
We studied all tests recorded in the CPRD primary care 
record during the study period. The CPRD contains 
primary care data, whereas secondary care data are 
WhAt Is AlreAdy knoWn on thIs topIc
Few data quantify the use of tests in primary care internationally
High income countries (Australia, United States) have published reports showing 
temporal increases in test use
In the United Kingdom, one study showed an increase in use of laboratory tests 
during 2005-09, but this was in a limited sample, only assessed laboratory tests, 
and was in a restricted population
WhAt thIs study Adds
Total test use has increased markedly over time, in both sexes, and across all 
age groups, test types (laboratory, imaging, and miscellaneous) and for 40 of 44 
tests specifically studied
Of the patients who underwent at least one test annually, the proportion who had 
more than one test increased significantly over time
In light of unprecedented financial strains on the National Health Service, 
accurate data on core primary care services are essential

captured in a separate database and were not included 
in this study. We also excluded physical examination 
findings, vital signs (including blood pressure), and 
body weights.
Tests were grouped into one of three categories: 
laboratory, 
imaging, 
or 
miscellaneous. 
The 
miscellaneous group included tests such as spirometry, 
upper endoscopy, colonoscopy, cervical smears, 
and electrocardiography. To avoid double counting, 
if the same code was recorded multiple times for 
the same patient on the same day, it was counted as 
one test. Similarly, codes that referred to the same 
test, or separate components of a test (eg, individual 
components of a full blood count), were grouped and 
counted as one test.
We also examined 44 specific tests (28 laboratory, 
11 imaging, and five miscellaneous), chosen because 
they are commonly used tests and are included in 
guidelines or in the Quality and Outcomes Framework 
(see supplementary file). The selected tests were 
discussed with our dedicated patient and public 
involvement group and agreed on by the study authors.
statistical analysis
For each year we calculated the total number of tests 
recorded in general practice, stratified by age and 
sex. We calculated total person years of observation 
in each age and sex stratum for each year. Patients 
alive and registered for the entire year contributed one 
person year of observation to the total. Patients who 
were born, died, registered, or deregistered during the 
year were included, but we adjusted their contribution 
proportionately to the person year calculation (eg, 
a patient who was registered and alive for only six 
months contributed 0.5 person years).
We calculated crude rates of test use per 10 000 
person years in each age and sex stratum for each year. 
For comparison across years, we standardised crude 
rates to the mid-2015 UK population.8 Rates were 
calculated for the total number of tests, each of the 44 
specific tests, and the three groups of tests.
Joinpoint regression was used to model the 
temporal changes in age and sex standardised rates.9 
We examined temporal changes from 2000/1 to 
2015/16, and, to account for any potential coding 
inconsistencies early in our study period, we 
conducted a sensitivity analysis for the period after the 
introduction of the Quality and Outcomes Framework 
(2004/5 to 2015/16). The locations of significant 
changes in slope (joinpoints) were identified, as were 
the annual percentage changes between joinpoints. 
We also calculated the average annual percentage 
change10 across the entire study period (2000/1 to 
2015/16) and for the period after the introduction 
of the Quality and Outcomes Framework (2004/5 to 
2015/16). For the 44 tests, we calculated the median 
annual percentage change and absolute change in test 
rate for tests included and not included in the Quality 
and Outcomes Framework.
We also explored whether the temporal change in 
test use was related to a change in the number of tests 
ordered per patient or an increase in the number of 
patients who underwent tests. To do this, we calculated 
the percentage of test use that was ordered for patients 
who received one test or more than one test (up to 100 
tests per patient) during the years 2000/1, 2004/5, and 
2015/16. For example, we calculated the proportion 
of tests in 2000/1 that were ordered for patients 
who received only one test all year. We examined the 
differences between these proportions across years 
using the χ2 test and report the percentage differences, 
with 95% confidence intervals and P values. We used 
Stata (version 14.2) for data extraction and cleaning, 
and R (version 3.4.1) for statistical analyses.
Patient and public involvement
The grant supporting this study has a dedicated 
patient group who were involved in refining the 
research question and protocol. A patient and public 
involvement focus group assisted with lay summaries.
results
Overall, 262 974 099 tests were ordered for 11 082 628 
patients over 71 436 331 patient years from 1 April 
2000 to 31 March 2016.
total test use
The age and sex adjusted rate of total test use increased 
from 14 869 tests per 10 000 person years in 2000/1 to 
49 267 in 2015/16 (table 1, fig 1), an annual increase 
of 8.5% (95% confidence interval 7.6% to 9.3%). The 
annual rate of test use also increased significantly 
after the introduction of the Quality and Outcomes 
Framework, although at a lower rate (4.3%, 3.4% to 
5.1%). The slope of the trend line changed significantly 
at two points: 2004/5 (P<0.001) and 2008/9 (P=0.004) 
(fig 1).
total test use by age group
Patients aged 45 to 64 had the highest rates of test use 
across all 16 study years, followed by those aged 65 to 
74 and then 25 to 44 (table 1). The age and sex adjusted 
rates of test use increased significantly in all age 
groups over the study period, by at least 6.5% annually 
(table 2). The largest annual increase was in patients 
aged more than 85 (11.1%, 9.8% to 12%), followed by 
patients aged 75 to 84 (9.8%, 8.8% to 10.8%). The rate 
of test use also increased significantly in all age groups 
after the introduction of the Quality and Outcomes 
Framework (table 2). Patients aged more than 85 also 
had the greatest annual increase in test use after the 
introduction of the Quality and Outcomes Framework 
(5.7%, 4.6% to 6.8%), followed by those aged 25 to 44 
(4.8%, 4.0% to 5.6%).
test types
Laboratory tests were used substantially more often 
than imaging and miscellaneous tests across the 
entire study period (fig 2, also see supplementary 
file). The adjusted rates of laboratory, imaging, 
and miscellaneous tests all increased statistically

significantly (table 3). Laboratory tests showed 
the greatest increase, from 13 091 tests per 10 000 
person years in 2000/1 to 44 847 in 2015/16 (see 
supplementary file), an annual increase of 8.7% (7.8% 
to 9.6%). Over the same period, the use of imaging and 
miscellaneous tests increased annually by 5.5% (4.7% 
to 6.4%) and 6.3% (5.3% to 7.3%), respectively. The 
use of all test types increased statistically significantly 
after the introduction of the Quality and Outcomes 
Framework, albeit less so (table 3).
number of tests ordered per patient
A greater proportion of tests was ordered on fewer 
patients in 2015/16 than in 2000/1. In 2015/16, 
32.7% of test use was ordered for patients who 
underwent more than 10 tests annually, compared 
with 9.5% in 2000/1 (absolute percentage change 
23.2%, 95% confidence interval 23.1% to 23.3%; 
P<0.001). Similarly, the proportion of tests ordered 
for patients who received only one test was 16.4% less 
(95% confidence interval 16.3% to 16.5%, P<0.001) in 
2015/16 than in 2000/1 (fig 3, and see supplementary 
table S6).
changes in use of specific tests
Renal function tests were the most commonly ordered 
test for most of the study period (2002/3 to 2015/16; 
see supplementary file). Full blood count was used 
most often in 2000/1 and 2001/2 and was the second 
most frequently ordered test during the remainder of 
the study (2002/3 to 2015/16). Liver function tests 
were the third most commonly ordered test from 
2001/2 to 2015/16, with urine dipstick testing third 
in 2000/1. Pelvic computed tomography (CT) and knee 
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) had the lowest 
adjusted rates of use (knee MRI from 2000/1 to 2006/7 
and pelvic CT from 2007/8 to 2015/16).
Over the study period, knee MRI showed the highest 
average annual increase (69.0%, 95% confidence 
interval 3.4% to 106.5%), followed by vitamin D tests 
(53.7%, 50.2% to 57.3%) and brain MRI (47.3%, 
39.5% to 55.5%) (see supplementary file). Vitamin D, 
knee MRI, and pelvic CT showed the greatest increases 
after the introduction of the Quality and Outcomes

Framework (see supplementary file). Knee MRI, brain 
MRI, and pelvic CT, however, showed only modest 
increases in absolute use over the entire study period 
(from <1 test per 10 000 person years in 2000 to 
around 10 tests per 10 000 person years in 2016; see 
supplementary table S7 and fig S10).
Vaginal swabbing was the only test that showed a 
statistically significant annual decrease in use over 
the study period (5.2%, 95% confidence interval 
4.1% to 6.3%). Over the same period, three tests 
(cervical smear, lumbar spine radiography, and urine 
testing for non-illicit drugs) had non-significant 
changes. The adjusted rates for four tests decreased 
statistically significantly after the introduction of the 
Quality and Outcomes Framework (creatine kinase, 
vaginal swabbing, smear test, and spirometry) (see 
supplementary file).
Five temporal patterns emerged in specific test use 
(also see supplementary file).
•  
A consistent linear increase for chest radiography 
and tests for vitamin B12, C reactive protein, iron, 
folate, clotting, and ferritin
•  
An initial rapid increase, followed by a less rapid 
increase for lumbar spine MRI, pelvic CT, knee MRI, 
dual energy x ray absorptiometry, brain MRI, female 
sex hormones, knee radiography, testosterone, 
renal function tests, urine albumin to creatinine 
ratio, bone profile, prostate specific antigen, full 
blood count, and liver function tests
•  
An initial increase followed by a plateau for 
echocardiography, 
thyroid 
function 
tests, 
erythrocyte sedimentation rate, upper endoscopy, 
urine microscopy and culture, progesterone, 
spirometry, vitamin D, and oestradiol
•  
An increase followed by a decrease (inverted U 
distribution) for glucose, lipids, troponin, urine 
dipstick, urine microalbumin, colonoscopy, smear 
test, creatine kinase, pelvic ultrasonography
•  
A decrease, an increase, and then a decrease for 
lumbar spine radiography and testing urine for 
non-illicit drugs. Two tests (glycated haemoglobin 
(HbA1c) and vaginal swabbing) did not adequately 
fit any category nor were similar to each other. 
Furthermore, tests included in the Quality and 
Outcomes Framework had a median average annual 
percentage increase of 9.8% (interquartile range 
6.6-12.8%) compared with 7.4% (4.6-16.4%) for 
tests not included in the Quality and Outcomes 
Framework (see supplementary table S9). The 
median absolute increase in tests included in 
the Quality and Outcomes Framework (830.9, 
interquartile range 250.3-1516.3) was also larger 
than for tests not included in the Quality and 
Outcomes Framework (57.2, 17.4-192.2).
discussion
We analysed the temporal change in tests ordered 
from UK primary care. The total use of tests increased 
markedly over time, even after adjustment for 
population growth; patients in 2015/16 had on 
average five tests per year, compared with 1.5 in 
2000/1. Test use increased in men and women (a 
3.4-fold and 3.3-fold increase, respectively, see 
supplementary figure S9) and in all age groups; 
elderly patients had the greatest increase (a 4.6-
fold increase for those aged more than 85). All types 
of tests (laboratory, imaging, and miscellaneous) 
increased statistically significantly, as did 40 of the 44

tests we studied specifically. Furthermore, there was 
a significant increase in the number of tests ordered 
per patient; of the patients who underwent at least 
one test annually, the proportion who had more than 
one test increased significantly over time. In light of 
unprecedented financial strains on the NHS, accurate 
data on core primary care services are essential. These 
results allow policymakers to assess trends in the use 
of tests, stratified by the type of test and the age and 
sex of patients, providing guidance for healthcare 
resource planning.
Many factors probably contribute to the increasing 
use of tests in UK primary care. Increased use could 
be a direct response to the increasing number and 
duration of consultations with general practitioners,2 
with tests reportedly being used for “strategic, non-
medical reasons,” such as reassuring patients and 
ending consultations.11 The increase in test use we 
report might also be due to changes to NHS services. 
Over the study period, general practitioners’ access 
to diagnostic tests expanded,12 many services were 
diverted from secondary to primary care,13 and the 
Quality and Outcomes Framework was introduced. 
The framework incentivises the monitoring of chronic 
diseases, which could partially explain the increase 
in laboratory tests. Additionally, increased use of 
testing by general practitioners might reflect a change 
in the patient-doctor relationship, including a greater 
expectation from patients that they should be tested.14 
With the advent of shared decision making—aided 
by campaigns such as Choosing Wisely15—patients 
are increasingly informed and encouraged to discuss 
healthcare choices. Evidence suggests that both 
clinicians16 and patients17 overestimate the benefits 
and underestimate the harms of tests; this is likely 
to contribute to more testing. Lastly, increases in 
test usage might more broadly reflect the possible 
medicolegal consequences of undertesting18 and the 
lack of disincentives to over-investigate.
Changes in the use of specific tests give further 
insights into the factors that increase use. The four 
haematinic tests (iron, ferritin, vitamin B12, and 
folate) followed the same linear pattern, as did tests 
for C reactive protein. These tests are typically used 
for patients with non-specific symptoms11 and might 
reflect clinician’s increased need to rule out disease in 
these patients. Imaging largely followed a pattern of a 
rapid increase that then diminished. This pattern may 
relate to time points when general practitioners gain 
direct access to imaging.
implications
Whatever factors contribute to increased test use, 
our results are likely to have major implications for 
general practitioners’ workload. Greater test use is 
likely to lead to more consultations and an increase 
in non-consultation workload. No data are available 
on the time it takes UK general practitioners to review 
test results. However, a US study suggested that 
primary care physicians on average spend two or three 
minutes reviewing a test (70 minutes a day).19 Using 
this estimate and the approximate average number of 
patients (n=7000) and general practitioners (n=3) in 
each general practice (which have changed minimally 
since 2005),20 we estimate that the average general 
practitioner spent 1.5 to 2 hours reviewing test results 
each workday in 2015/16. This is a more than threefold 
increase from the estimated 2000/1 figure of 25 to 
35 minutes daily. Our results support other evidence 
that suggests general practice workload in the UK is 
reaching saturation point.2
Similarly, our results indicate the burden of tests 
ordered by general practitioners on NHS expenditure. 
Using conservative estimates from the National 
Institute for Health and Care Excellence21 (£6 for 
a laboratory test, £29 for imaging, and £53 for 
miscellaneous tests), we estimate that general practice 
related test use cost £2.8bn in 2015/16 (£1.8bn for 
laboratory tests, £400 000 for imaging, and £600 000 
for miscellaneous tests). Notably, these estimates 
are likely an underestimation of the true costs. Our 
estimates only account for the direct cost of tests and do 
not include the cost of general practitioners reviewing 
the result or the administration team processing the 
result.
strengths and weaknesses in relation to other 
studies
There are no official statistics on the use of tests in the 
UK. A 2013 study assessed temporal changes in 29 
laboratory tests ordered from UK primary care during 
2005-09 in a random sample of 100 000 patients.3 The 
authors also calculated an average temporal change for 
all 29 tests. Our study, in comparison, was not exclusive 
in its selection of tests or patients—we assessed the 
change in use of all tests, in all registered patients 
over a longer period. We also assessed more tests 
individually and all types of tests over time (laboratory, 
imaging, and miscellaneous). Nevertheless, our results 
over the same period are similar; we found that the 
annual number of all laboratory tests increased 
from around three tests per patient in 2005 (31 306 
per 10 000 person years) to four tests per patient in 
2009 (38 758 per 10 000 person years). Busby and 
colleagues reported that the ordering of 29 specific 
laboratory tests on average increased from 2.4 tests per 
patient (23 872 per 10 000 person years) to 3.0 tests per 
patient (29 644 per 10 000 person years) over the same 
period.3 Furthermore, our results are in line with data 
from other countries. An Australian study reported a 
54% increase in laboratory test ordering from 2000/1 
to 2007/8,22 whereas in the US from 1997 to 2006, CT 
and MRI increased by 14% and 26% annually.23
We have not examined the appropriateness of the 
changes in total and specific test use. It is plausible 
that a substantial proportion of the temporal changes 
we found represents over-testing. Although the 
definition remains contentious,24 over-testing occurs 
when a test is ordered unnecessarily; where the harms 
outweigh the benefits.25 Previous studies have used 
guidelines as a metric to define the appropriate use 
of tests,25 but evidence suggests a variable quality

of guideline recommendations related to diagnostic 
tests.26 This limitation makes the methods for detecting 
unnecessary testing a challenge. Nevertheless, over-
testing is thought to be common and increasing 
in healthcare systems, particularly in developed 
countries.25 27 28 Although our results do not explicitly 
quantify over-testing, we have identified tests with the 
greatest temporal change in use, and we graphically 
display the tests that have shown recent, exponential 
increases in use (see supplementary figure S10).
Although our data did not allow us to explicitly 
explore the appropriateness of changes in test use, 
some tests are more likely to have been inappropriately 
overused. Similarly, there are some tests where the 
changes we report are likely to be appropriate. Over 
the study period, testing for vitamin D increased 
exponentially; an average annual increase of more 
than 54% (the second most of any test). In absolute 
terms, 182 more vitamin D tests were ordered per 
10 000 person years in 2015 compared with 2000. 
Similar increases have been noted in other high 
income countries, including Australia,29 Canada,30 31 
and the US.32 Although the appropriateness of vitamin 
D test use has not been explicitly examined in the UK, 
it has been in other high income countries that have 
experienced similar increases.30-32 In Canada, up to 
40% of vitamin D tests are estimated to be incongruent 
with guidelines—that is, the test is a repeat test within 
three months of the original test or the test is ordered 
for a patient who has already had two tests that year.30 
Similarly in the US, 44% of vitamin D tests were 
estimated to be “unnecessary screening.”32 In the UK, 
there is evidence that most vitamin D tests return a 
normal result.33 This might suggest that many of the 
vitamin D tests ordered are unnecessary screening.
The non-significant change in use of lumbar spine 
radiography is of concern. In early 2000 numerous 
randomised 
controlled 
trials 
investigated 
the 
effectiveness of imaging for non-red flag low back 
pain.34-38 These studies concluded that imaging for low 
back pain without red flags does not benefit patients, 
nor is it cost effective. Despite this evidence, our results 
suggest no major change in lumbar spine radiography 
ordered in 2015 compared with 2000. Furthermore, the 
use of lumbar spine MRIs has increased significantly 
over the study period. Without any clear justification, 
the use of lumbar spine MRIs has increased by 15% a 
year and, in absolute terms, 53 more tests per 10 000 
person years. Imaging tests are labour intensive and 
not without potential harm.39
Conversely, the increase in use of HbA1c tests and 
the plateau of urine microscopy and culture test use 
is likely to reflect appropriate changes. The HbA1c 
test was originally approved exclusively to monitor 
patients with diabetes. In 2011, however, the World 
Health Organization approved the use of the test to 
diagnose as well as monitor diabetes.40 This guideline 
change is likely to have contributed to the significant 
increase in HbA1c test use from this date.
In 2006, the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines 
Network guideline recommended a clinical diagnosis 
of urinary tract infection,41 also adopted by NICE. 
This guideline change coincided with a plateau in the 
number of urine microscopy and culture tests ordered. 
From 2007, the average annual increase in these tests 
was 0.1% (95% confidence interval −0.7% to 0.9%), 
compared with 9.3% (8% to 10.7%) from 2000 to 
2007. For most tests, however, further investigation 
into the causes and appropriateness of these changes 
is still required.
limitations of this study
A potential limitation of our analysis is the inconsistency 
of coding across the study period. To deal with this we 
only included general practices using CPRD quality 
assured data. Furthermore, we considered the ordering 
of a test as either a record indicating that the test had 
been ordered or evidence of the test result (eg, by 
letter or by a numerical result). Letter correspondence 
is often incorporated into CPRD, with around 90% 
compliance.42 43 We therefore captured tests when the 
order was not directly documented. To mitigate double 
counting, if the same test appeared in a patient record 
twice on one day, we matched these data entries and 
counted only one test.
Furthermore, previous literature suggests that test 
coding within CPRD has been accurate and stable over 
time. A systematic review reports that all abnormal test 
results are recorded accurately in CPRD.44 A separate 
study3 reports that from 2000 the proportion of 
abnormal test results, out of the total number of tests 
ordered, has remained relatively constant in CPRD 
(28.7% from 2000 to 2004 and 27.0% from 2005 
onwards). These results suggest that the coding of all 
test results (normal and abnormal) has been consistent 
from 2000.
The introduction of the Quality and Outcomes 
Framework improved the frequency of data entry 
in general practitioner records45; 90% of doctors 
were electronically ordering tests from this date.3 46 
Thus, to further investigate any effects of potentially 
incomplete coding in the early 2000s, we conducted 
a sensitivity analysis, restricting the study period to 
after the introduction of the Quality and Outcomes 
Framework. Comparison of our primary and sensitivity 
analyses shows a consistent direction of results, with 
the magnitude of increase greater in the main analysis.
The results from our analysis of 44 specific tests 
suggest that coding before 2004/5 was valid. The use 
of three tests (laboratory, imaging, and miscellaneous) 
decreased statistically significantly from 2000 to 
2003/4. If the data were not coded appropriately, and 
thus tests were missed before the introduction of the 
Quality and Outcomes Framework, we would not have 
anticipated any reductions in the use of any test. It is of 
further encouragement that we noted reductions in the 
use across all three test types (laboratory, imaging, and 
miscellaneous).
Nevertheless, even if the earlier period is discounted 
(2000/1 to 2003/4) our sensitivity analysis suggests 
the same conclusion: a significant increase in the use 
of tests over time (see supplementary file).

Another potential limitation of our study is the 
contamination of secondary care data within the 
CPRD. Given the CPRD’s extensive use and validation 
as a primary care database and the existence of a 
dedicated secondary care database (Hospital Episode 
Statistics), we feel this is unlikely. The temporal 
trends in brain and knee MRI also further support the 
lack of contamination from secondary care data (see 
supplementary file).
Although data in the CPRD are available before 
2000, we examined test use from this date for several 
reasons—namely, the advent of NICE (1999) and the 
emergence of evidence based practice in UK primary 
care. Because of our concerns about the quality of 
data before 2000 we were advised by CPRD experts 
to start the analysis from 2000. Finally, although the 
CPRD database is representative of the UK population 
in terms of age, sex,5 and ethnic background,6 it only 
extracts data from general practices that use the Vision 
GP system. Practices that use this system are located 
around the UK, but are concentrated in the south of 
England.47
Further research
Future research should focus on determining the 
appropriateness of the temporal changes we have 
reported. Ideally, this research should use individual 
patient data to measure appropriateness directly 
against evidence based criteria. We suggest an initial 
focus on the tests with the greatest temporal changes.
Further research can also investigate factors that 
increase the use of tests in particular patient groups, 
such as people older than 85, in whom test ordering 
showed the greatest increase. Additional research 
investigating the consequences of accelerating test use 
(eg, on specialist referral and treatment) would also be 
valuable.
Some of our team are involved in delivering 
OpenPathology.net 28; an open data tool (similar to 
OpenPrescribing.net) that provides easy access to 
various analytical approaches identifying test ordering 
behaviour in primary care. This tool will continue our 
work exploring temporal trends on a live interface.
conclusion
The use of tests from UK general practices is increasing 
substantially; in both sexes and across all patient ages, 
test types, and 40 of 44 tests specifically studied. These 
changes have outstripped population growth. In light 
of unprecedented financial strains on the NHS, these 
results allow policymakers to assess trends in the use 
of tests, stratified by the type of test and the age and 
sex of patients. Our results will provide guidance for 
future healthcare resource planning.
