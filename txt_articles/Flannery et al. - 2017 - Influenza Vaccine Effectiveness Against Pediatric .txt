abstract
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Surveillance for laboratory-confirmed influenza-associated 
pediatric deaths since 2004 has shown that most deaths occur in unvaccinated children. We 
assessed whether influenza vaccination reduced the risk of influenza-associated death in 
children and adolescents.
METHODS: We conducted a case–cohort analysis comparing vaccination uptake among 
laboratory-confirmed influenza-associated pediatric deaths with estimated vaccination 
coverage among pediatric cohorts in the United States. Case vaccination and high-risk 
status were determined by case investigation. Influenza vaccination coverage estimates 
were obtained from national survey data or a national insurance claims database. We 
estimated odds ratios from logistic regression comparing odds of vaccination among  
cases with odds of vaccination in comparison cohorts. We used Bayesian methods to 
compute 95% credible intervals (CIs) for vaccine effectiveness (VE), calculated as  
(1 − odds ratio) × 100.
RESULTS: From July 2010 through June 2014, 358 laboratory-confirmed influenza-associated 
pediatric deaths were reported among children aged 6 months through 17 years. 
Vaccination status was determined for 291 deaths; 75 (26%) received vaccine before illness 
onset. Average vaccination coverage in survey cohorts was 48%. Overall VE against death 
was 65% (95% CI, 54% to 74%). Among 153 deaths in children with underlying high-risk 
medical conditions, 47 (31%) were vaccinated. VE among children with high-risk conditions 
was 51% (95% CI, 31% to 67%), compared with 65% (95% CI, 47% to 78%) among children 
without high-risk conditions.
CONCLUSIONS: Influenza vaccination was associated with reduced risk of laboratory-confirmed 
influenza-associated pediatric death. Increasing influenza vaccination could prevent 
influenza-associated deaths among children and adolescents.

In the United States, annual 
influenza vaccination of children is 
recommended to reduce adverse 
health impacts of influenza and 
prevent severe complications.1 
Though uncommon, influenza-
associated deaths among children 
occur annually, with varying 
incidence depending on the severity 
of the influenza season.2, 
 
3 From 1976 
to 2007, influenza was estimated to 
account for >100 deaths annually 
among children and adolescents.4, 
5  
Since 2004, when influenza-
associated deaths among children 
aged <18 years became nationally 
notifiable, 
6 reported numbers of 
deaths have ranged from 37 in the 
2011–2012 season to 358 during the 
2009 pandemic.2 Surveillance for 
pediatric deaths has contributed to 
identification of groups at high risk of 
influenza-related mortality, such as 
children with neurologic conditions, 
7 
and documented fatal illness among 
children with and without underlying 
high-risk medical conditions.3 
Previous reports have indicated  
low rates of influenza vaccination 
among pediatric deaths despite 
a high prevalence of underlying 
medical conditions that increase risk 
for influenza complications.3, 
 
8  
In this analysis, we used a case–
cohort approach comparing influenza 
vaccination rates among influenza-
associated pediatric deaths with 
vaccination coverage estimates for 
cohorts of US children to estimate the 
effectiveness of influenza vaccination 
against laboratory-confirmed 
influenza-associated death.
MeThODs
Influenza-associated Pediatric 
Deaths
To estimate influenza vaccine 
effectiveness (VE) against death, 
we used a case–cohort design (or 
screening method).9, 
 
10 Cases were 
deaths in US residents aged <18 years 
with laboratory-confirmed influenza 
virus infection that were reported to 
the Influenza-Associated Pediatric 
Mortality Surveillance System.3 
Data obtained from standardized 
case report forms included 
demographic characteristics, state 
of residence, results of laboratory 
testing, underlying high-risk medical 
conditions, and influenza vaccination 
status. Confirmation of influenza 
virus infection consisted of clinical 
diagnostic testing during illness or 
postmortem examination including 
antigen detection, viral culture, 
or nucleic acid amplification. We 
included children ≥6 months old on 
November 1 of the influenza season 
during which death occurred who 
were eligible to receive ≥1 dose 
of seasonal influenza vaccine and 
had complete medical history; 10 
deaths among children who turned 
6 months old after November 1 were 
excluded. For cases without illness 
onset date, we estimated onset as 
4 days before death, based on the 
mean duration of illness among cases 
with known onset date. We excluded 
7 children who received their first 
dose of current season vaccine <14 
days before illness onset because 
vaccine-induced protection may be 
incomplete.11
Health department personnel 
determined vaccination status based 
on a review of available information 
from the child’s medical records, 
health care provider, state or county 
immunization information systems, 
parental report, or coroner’s report. 
Children were considered vaccinated 
(either fully or partially) if records 
indicated receipt of ≥1 doses of 
current season influenza vaccine ≥14 
days before onset of illness. Partial 
vaccination was defined as receipt 
of 1 dose when health department 
personnel determined that 2 doses 
were indicated. Vaccination status 
was listed as unknown if surveillance 
personnel could not determine from 
available records whether the child 
had received influenza vaccine. If 
immunization records indicated 
vaccination for previous seasons 
but no current season vaccination, 
children were assumed to be 
unvaccinated. A sensitivity analysis 
explored the effects of assuming that 
children with unknown vaccination 
status were unvaccinated. Presence 
of underlying medical conditions 
was recorded on case report forms 
according to high-risk conditions 
for influenza-related complications 
identified by the Advisory Committee 
on Immunization Practices (ACIP)12: 
asthma, chronic lung disease, 
neurologic or neurodevelopmental 
disorders, heart disease (including 
congenital heart disease), blood 
disorders, endocrine disorders, 
metabolic disorders, kidney 
disorders, liver disorders, 
immunosuppression, and pregnancy. 
For consistency with vaccination 
coverage estimates, age groups 
were defined based on child’s age on 
November 1 for influenza season of 
fatal illness.
Influenza Vaccination coverage  
in cohorts
We used 3 sources of influenza 
vaccination coverage among 
comparison cohorts of US children 
and adolescents: National 
Immunization Survey–Flu (NIS-
Flu), 
13 National Health Interview 
Survey (NHIS), 
14 and the MarketScan 
Commercial Claims and Encounters 
database (Truven Health Analytics, 
Ann Arbor, MI). NIS-Flu is a national 
telephone survey of households with 
children aged 6 months through 
17 years that produces national 
and state-level estimates (and for 
some cities, including Chicago and 
New York City) of influenza vaccine 
coverage for children. NHIS is an 
in-person household survey that 
provides nationally representative 
estimates of influenza vaccination 
for children aged 6 months through 
17 years with and without specified 
high-risk medical conditions (cystic 
fibrosis, sickle cell anemia, diabetes, 
congenital heart disease or other 
heart condition, cerebral palsy, 
muscular dystrophy, or seizures,

or an asthma episode in the past 
12 months).15 In NIS-Flu and NHIS, 
seasonal influenza vaccination 
coverage is estimated from parental 
report of child’s receipt of ≥1 dose 
of seasonal influenza vaccine. Data 
from NIS-Flu and NHIS are weighted 
by age, sex, race or ethnicity, and 
geographic area to represent the 
US population. Monthly coverage 
estimates and SEs for vaccination 
received during July or August 
(depending on survey and season) 
through May were calculated by 
Kaplan–Meier survival analysis of 
data from interviews conducted 
from August, September, or October 
through June.16 Age group was based 
on the child’s age on November 1 of 
each influenza season.
In the MarketScan Commercial 
Claims and Encounters database, 
coverage estimates were based 
on commercial insurance claims 
for influenza vaccination; children 
with no vaccination claim were 
assumed unvaccinated. We analyzed 
data from July 2010 through June 
2014 among children continuously 
enrolled in a health plan from 
January preceding each influenza 
season. We determined underlying 
high-risk medical conditions based 
on International Classification of 
Diseases, Ninth Revision codes 
associated with hospitalizations and 
outpatient visits during a 12-month 
period.17 We calculated cumulative 
vaccination coverage from August 
through May each season among 
children aged <18 years with and 
without underlying high-risk medical 
conditions. Age categories were 
based on child’s age at vaccination 
or at the beginning of each calendar 
year; children in the youngest age 
category (0–4 years) were ≥10 
months old on November 1. For 
MarketScan comparison cohorts, 
state-level coverage estimates were 
used for children without high-risk 
conditions, and national coverage 
estimates were used for children in 
high-risk groups because of their 
smaller sample sizes.
analysis
The case–cohort method9, 
 
10 produces 
an odds ratio (OR), which estimates 
the relative risk for influenza-
associated death among vaccinated 
versus unvaccinated children. 
Influenza VE was estimated as 
(1 − OR). ORs were obtained from 
logistic regression models where 
vaccination status of the case was 
the dependent variable and the log 
odds of vaccination (proportion 
vaccinated/1 − proportion 
vaccinated) in the comparison cohort 
from NIS-Flu, NHIS, or MarketScan 
data were entered as an offset. 
With this offset in the model, the 
intercept provides an estimate of the 
log(OR). Cases and corresponding 
coverage estimates were stratified 
by influenza season, age, and 
state of residence (for NIS-Flu and 
MarketScan) or high-risk condition 
(for NHIS and MarketScan) for the 
month ending ≥2 weeks before case 
illness onset. For average coverage 
estimates by age group, season, or 
influenza virus type, we derived 
confidence limits by averaging the 
variance of independent, normally 
distributed coverage estimates. To 
incorporate uncertainty in coverage 
estimates from survey data, 10 000 
estimates were sampled from 
normally distributed vaccination 
coverage estimates for NIS-Flu 
and NHIS comparison cohorts to 
calculate 95% credible intervals 
(CIs) for VE estimates. Because 
MarketScan estimates were derived 
from all observations without 
sampling, confidence limits for VE 
estimates based on MarketScan 
data were estimated from logistic 
regression assuming fixed coverage 
estimates. We assumed that cases 
did not contribute uncertainty to VE 
estimates. Sensitivity analyses were 
conducted under the assumption 
that cases with unknown vaccination 
status were unvaccinated and that 
coverage estimates based on parental 
report underestimated coverage by 
10% or overestimated coverage by 
10% or 20%.18, 
 
19 χ2 tests were used 
to evaluate proportions, and 2-sided 
P values <.05 were considered 
significant. Analyses were conducted 
in SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Inc, 
Cary, NC) and R (version 3.1.1; R Core 
Team, Vienna, Austria).
ResulTs
This analysis included 358 influenza-
associated pediatric deaths that 
occurred during 4 influenza seasons 
from July 1, 2010 through June 30, 
2014 among children aged 6 months 
through 17 years. Deaths were 
reported from 43 states, New York 
City, Chicago, and Washington, DC. 
Vaccination status was unknown 
for 67 (19%) children who died. 
Of 291 deaths in children with 
known vaccination status, 75 (26%) 
children had received seasonal 
influenza vaccination ≥14 days 
before illness onset and were 
considered vaccinated. Vaccine type 
was recorded for 62 cases; 12 (19%) 
received live-attenuated influenza 
vaccine and 50 (81%) received 
inactivated influenza vaccines. 
Vaccinated proportions were similar 
for boys and girls and did not differ 
significantly by age category (Table 
1). Black non-Hispanic children 
who died had significantly lower 
vaccination rates compared with 
white non-Hispanic children who 
died (P < .05). Among 31 deaths in 
vaccinated children aged 6 months 
through 4 years, 16 (52%) were 
partially vaccinated.
A total of 153 (53%) of 291 pediatric 
deaths with known vaccination 
status occurred among children 
with ≥1 ACIP underlying high-risk 
medical conditions. The prevalence 
of high-risk conditions among 
pediatric deaths increased from 41% 
among those aged 6 months to 4 
years to 57% and 62% among 5- to 
12-year-olds and 13- to 17-year-olds,

respectively. Although the proportion 
of cases vaccinated increased from 
20% among those without high-risk 
conditions to 31% among those 
with ≥1 high-risk condition and 
37% among those with ≥2 high-
risk conditions, <50% of cases in all 
individual high-risk categories were 
vaccinated (Table 1).
Average influenza vaccination 
coverage among comparison cohorts 
in the month preceding case illness 
onset was higher than vaccinated 
proportions among pediatric deaths 
for most months (Fig 1). Among 
deaths in children with known 
vaccination status, children who 
died had lower vaccination uptake 
for all age categories, seasons, and 
infecting influenza virus types than 
the NIS-Flu cohort (Table 2). Overall, 
average vaccination coverage was 
48% among NIS-Flu comparison 
cohorts. Estimated VE against 
pediatric death was 65% (95% CI, 
54% to 74%). Estimated VE ranged 
from 40% among 13- to 17-year-
olds to 76% among 5- to 12-year-
olds. By season, VE ranged from 
54% in the 2010 to 2011 season 
to 80% (with overlapping credible 
intervals) in the mild 2011 to 2012 
season, with the lowest number of 
pediatric deaths. By virus type, VE 
point estimates were similar against 
death associated with influenza A 
virus (66%) and influenza B virus 
(62%).
Vaccination uptake among pediatric 
deaths was also lower than average 
coverage in the NHIS comparison 
cohorts with or without high-risk 
conditions (Table 3). Estimated 
VE was 51% (95% CI, 31% to 
67%) among children with high-
risk medical conditions and 65% 
(95% CI, 47% to 78%) among 
those without high-risk conditions, 
similar to VE estimated via NIS-
Flu. VE point estimates were lower 
among children with high-risk 
conditions compared with those 
without high-risk conditions in 
most analyses, but CIs widely 
overlapped. Among children with 
high-risk conditions, VE estimates 
were statistically significant 
(95% CIs not overlapping 0) only 
for children aged 5 to 12 years. 
Estimated VE was statistically 
significant for 3 of 4 seasons among 
both children with and without 
high-risk conditions, for influenza A 
virus infections among both groups 
of children, and for influenza B virus 
infections among children without 
high-risk conditions.
 
Table 4 compares the prevalence 
of high-risk conditions and uptake 
of influenza vaccination among 
influenza-associated pediatric deaths 
and children in the MarketScan 
database (including an average of 
>6 million children aged <18 years 
during the 4 influenza seasons).

Vaccination coverage in MarketScan 
among children aged <18 years by 
high-risk group ranged from 27% 
among those with no high-risk 
condition to 45% among children 
with ≥2 high-risk conditions (Table 
4). Prevalence of high-risk conditions 
was higher among pediatric deaths 
compared with the MarketScan 
cohort, and vaccination rates were 
lower among pediatric deaths for 
most high-risk groups.
In sensitivity analysis treating  
deaths with unknown vaccination 
status as unvaccinated, overall VE 
increased to 74% for the NIS-Flu 
cohort, 73% for the NHIS cohort 
without high-risk conditions, and 
50% for the MarketScan cohort 
without high-risk conditions (Table 5).  
Alternatively, assuming 10% 
overestimation of vaccination by 
parental report in the survey data 
led to estimates of 56% with NIS-Flu 
and 58% with the NHIS no high-
risk cohort. MarketScan estimates 
treating deaths with unknown 
vaccination status as unvaccinated 
were similar to NHIS estimates 
assuming 20% overestimation of 
coverage by parental report. VE 
estimates among children with 
high-risk conditions were lower 
than among those without high-risk 
conditions for the MarketScan and 
NHIS cohorts. Estimated VE among 
children with high-risk conditions 
remained statistically significant; 
NHIS coverage estimates were 
decreased by 10%, whereas that 
among children without high-risk 
conditions remained significant when 
NHIS estimates were decreased by 
20%.
DIscussIOn
We used national surveillance data 
on laboratory-confirmed influenza 
deaths and 3 comparison cohorts 
over 4 influenza seasons to estimate 
the effectiveness of influenza 
vaccination to prevent influenza-
associated pediatric deaths. Best 
estimates based on NHIS survey data 
suggested that vaccination reduced 
the risk of influenza-associated death 
by half among children with high-risk 
conditions and by nearly two-thirds 
among children without high-risk 
conditions. Despite high prevalence 
(53%) of underlying conditions that 
increase risk of severe influenza-
related complications, only 1 in 4 
children who died with laboratory-
confirmed influenza had been 
vaccinated. These results reinforce 
the need to increase influenza 
vaccination coverage, especially 
among children at increased risk of 
influenza-related complications and 
death.
To our knowledge, this is the first 
study to use laboratory-confirmed 
outcomes to investigate influenza VE 
against influenza-associated deaths. 
Observational studies that have 
used nonspecific outcomes, such 
as all-cause mortality, have often

– 
22 Estimates of VE against 
death from this analysis were similar 
to VE against medically attended 
influenza among pediatric patients 
for the same seasons. For 2011—
2012 through 2013—2014 seasons, 
estimated VE against medically 
attended influenza ranged from 
45% to 57% among young children 
(ages 6 months–8 years) and from 
39% to 58% among older children 
(ages 9–17 years).23

estimated VE against severe life-

on comparisons with NHIS and NIS-
Flu, the 2 surveys used to measure 
influenza vaccine coverage among 
US children. NHIS includes coverage 
estimates among children with 
high-risk conditions, and NIS-Flu, 
with its larger sample size, provides 
state-level vaccination coverage. 
NHIS has been considered the most 
representative source for influenza 
vaccination coverage estimates 
among children15 and is used as 
the data source to track progress 
toward Healthy People 2020 goals.32 
VE estimates based on NIS-Flu were 
similar to those based on the NHIS 
cohort without high-risk conditions.
This study highlights the importance 
of annual influenza vaccination 
for children, especially those with 
underlying high-risk medical 
conditions. Previous reports have 
highlighted the high prevalence of 
underlying high-risk conditions 
among children who die of influenza-
related complications, including 
neurologic disorders and conditions 
associated with underlying 
chromosomal abnormalities and 
genetic syndromes.3, 
 
7, 
 
33 Although 
children with high-risk conditions 
in both the NHIS and MarketScan 
data were more likely than children 
without high-risk conditions to be 
vaccinated, vaccination coverage 
among children at high risk 
remained below the Healthy People 
2020 target of 70% during these 
seasons.32 Because of the higher 
risk of severe complications and 
influenza-associated death among 
children with underlying conditions, 
vaccination is especially important 
for these children. Previous reports 
have also highlighted the occurrence 
of influenza-associated death in 
previously healthy children with no 
reported high-risk conditions.3, 
 
34 The 
current study indicates that although 
VE estimates tended to be higher 
among children without underlying 
high-risk conditions, significant 
protection was demonstrated for 
both groups of children for most 
seasons.
This analysis is subject to several 
limitations. Coverage estimates from 
NIS-Flu and NHIS rely on the accuracy 
of parental report of influenza 
vaccination, which has been found 
to overestimate provider report of 
coverage.18 Overreporting may be

more common for adolescents and 
children with high-risk conditions.19 
The MarketScan database included 
only privately insured children, and 
vaccination rates based on insurance 
claims of influenza vaccination were 
lower than those based on reported 
vaccination for the NHIS cohort. 
However, MarketScan estimates 
were also lower than observed 
vaccination rates (53%–56% among 
children aged 6 months–8 years and 
37%– 43% among those aged 9–17 
years) among influenza-negative 
children enrolled in the outpatient 
Influenza Vaccine Effectiveness 
network from 2011—2012 through 
2013—2014.23 
–25 Sensitivity analysis 
suggested that vaccination still 
provided protection against death, 
assuming 10% to 20% overreporting 
in NHIS, which resulted in similar 
estimates to comparisons with 
MarketScan cohorts. An alternative 
source of comparison coverage would 
be immunization information systems, 
but reporting of influenza vaccination 
for children is not mandatory in all 
states.35 The majority of pediatric 
deaths with unknown vaccination 
status had no documentation of 
influenza vaccination in immunization 
information systems and were 
probably unvaccinated; sensitivity 
analyses treating these deaths as 
unvaccinated resulted in higher VE 
estimates. Vaccination coverage in 
the comparison cohorts was probably 
intermediate between estimates 
based on parental report and 
those based on insurance claims.18 
Finally, our analysis excluded deaths 
among infants who became eligible 
for vaccination after November 
1 of each season and included 
partially vaccinated children; partial 
vaccination provided no protection 
against severe influenza in a study 
conducted among children with 
influenza admitted to PICUs.27
Results of this study suggest that 
vaccination reduced the risk of 
influenza-associated death among 
children and adolescents and 
add to the evidence of benefits of 
influenza vaccination for children. 
Annual vaccination is an important 
strategy to prevent influenza and 
influenza-associated complications 
and deaths. These results support 
current recommendations for annual 
influenza vaccination for all children 
≥6 months of age.
