Ionizing radiation is a potent carcinogen, inducing cancer through DNA damage. The signatures
of mutations arising in human tissues following in vivo exposure to ionizing radiation have not
been documented. Here, we searched for signatures of ionizing radiation in 12 radiation-asso-
ciated second malignancies of different tumour types. Two signatures of somatic mutation
characterize ionizing radiation exposure irrespective of tumour type. Compared with 319
radiation-naive tumours, radiation-associated tumours carry a median extra 201 deletions
genome-wide, sized 1–100 base pairs often with microhomology at the junction. Unlike deletions
of radiation-naive tumours, these show no variation in density across the genome or correlation
with sequence context, replication timing or chromatin structure. Furthermore, we observe a
significant increase in balanced inversions in radiation-associated tumours. Both small deletions
and inversions generate driver mutations. Thus, ionizing radiation generates distinctive muta-
tional signatures that explain its carcinogenic potential.

xposure
to
ionizing
radiation
increases
the
risk
of
subsequent cancer. This risk exhibits a strong dose–
response relationship, and there appear to be no safe limits
for radiation exposure1. This association was first noted by March
who observed an increased incidence of leukaemia amongst
radiologists2. A leading cause of radiation-induced cancers
appears to be exposure to medical radiation, either in the form
of radiotherapy for an unrelated malignancy3 or diagnostic
radiography4,5. These iatrogenic tumours arise as de novo
neoplasms in a field of therapeutic radiation after a latency
period that can span decades6, and are not recurrences of the
original cancer7.
Many, but not all, environmental carcinogens induce cancer by
increasing the rate of mutation in somatic cells. The physico-
chemical properties of a given carcinogen govern its interaction
with DNA, leading to recurrent ‘signatures’ or patterns of
mutations in the genome. These can be reconstructed either from
experimental model systems8,9 or from statistical analyses of
cancer genomes in exposed patients10–12. Ionizing radiation
directly damages DNA, and can generate lesions on single bases,
single-stranded nicks in the DNA backbone, clustered lesions at
several nearby sites and double-stranded DNA breaks13. In
experimental systems exposed to radiation, including the murine
germline and Arabidopsis thaliana cells, ionizing radiation can
cause all classes of mutations, with possible enrichment of
indels14–22. Targeted gene screens in radiation-induced sarcoma
have indicated an increased burden of deletions and substitutions
with frequent inactivation of TP53 and RB1 (refs 23–25). In
addition, a transcriptome profile that represents a state of chronic
oxidative stress has been proposed to be specific to radiation-
associated sarcoma26.
We studied the genomes of 12 radiation-associated second
malignancies of four different tumour types: osteosarcoma;
spindle cell sarcoma; angiosarcoma; breast cancer. These were
secondary tumours that arose within a field of therapeutic
ionizing radiation and were not thought to be recurrences of the
original malignancy treated with radiation. We chose this
experimental design for several reasons: the tumours are classic
radiotherapy-induced cancers with high attributable risks for the
radiation exposure; the radiation exposure occurs over a short
time period relative to the evolution of the cancer; and the
mutational signatures of sporadic breast cancers and sarcomas
have been well documented10,27–29. It should be noted that in the
absence of biomarkers, a diagnosis of a tumour being radiation-
induced cannot be definitively made (see Supplementary Note 1
for clinical details and further discussion).
We subjected these 12 tumours, along with normal tissues from
the same patients, to whole-genome sequencing and obtained
catalogues of somatic mutations. We compared our findings to
319 radiation-naive breast cancers and sarcomas processed by the
same
sequencing
and
bioinformatics
pipeline:
251
breast
tumours; 33 breast tumours with pathogenic BRCA1 or BRCA2
germline mutations; 35 osteosarcomas (see Methods for cohort
details). In addition, we validated our findings in a published
series of radiation-naı
¨ve and radiation-exposed prostate tumours
from ten patients30.
The main aim of our analyses was to search for tumour-type
independent, overarching signatures of ionizing radiation. Overall
we identified two such signatures in radiation-associated second
malignancies, an excess of balanced inversions and of small
deletions.
Results
Tumour-type specific features. The 12 radiation-associated
tumours
harboured
1,506–9,245
substitutions
per
genome
(median 4113), 135–943 indels per genome, (median 429) and
6–321 rearrangement break points per genome (median 74;
Supplementary Data 1–3). The observed driver mutations
followed the patterns expected for the tumour type consistently
(Supplementary Table 1). Angiosarcomas harboured PTPRB and
PLCG1 mutations. In spindle cell sarcoma and osteosarcoma
driver alteration of TP53 and CDKN2A were found. Canonical
PIK3CA mutations were seen in the radiation-associated breast
tumours. Similarly, many of the mutational signatures seen in
sporadic cancers were also present in radiation-associated
tumours, such as chromothripsis in sarcomas (Supplementary
Fig. 1). Against this backdrop of genomic diversity, we found
evidence for two mutational signatures in the radiation-associated
cancers that transcended tumour type: small deletions and
balanced inversions.
Enrichment of deletions in radiation-associated tumours.
Although the absolute burden of indels varied across the 12
radiation-associated tumours, in each tumour the indel burden
was high compared with that tumour’s substitution burden
(Fig. 1a). Compared with 319 radiation-naive tumours, the indel/
substitution
ratio was significantly
increased
in radiation-
associated tumours (P ¼ 0.0003, linear mixed effects model, see
Methods).
Deletions and insertions were not equally enriched. There was
a significant excess of deletions relative to insertions in radiation-
associated second malignancies (Fig. 1b; Po2.2 � 10 � 16, linear
mixed effects model). This excess of deletions was also seen in
BRCA1 or BRCA2 germline-deficient breast tumours, as pre-
viously described27, but was not seen in radiation-naive sporadic
breast tumours or sarcomas. In each radiation-associated tumour,
the radiotherapy had been given over a relatively short time
period many years earlier. If the excess deletions we observed
were
directly
attributable
to
ionizing
radiation,
then
the
enrichment should only be evident amongst the early, clonal
mutations and not in the late, subclonal mutations. We were able
to define subclones in three of the radiation-associated tumour
genomes.
Strikingly,
compared
with
subclonal
mutations,
deletions were significantly increased compared with insertions
amongst clonal mutations in all three cases (Fig. 1c, Po0.00005;
Fisher’s exact test).
Distribution of deletions across the genome. Many mutational
signatures show uneven distribution across the genome, especially
those associated with carcinogens such as tobacco smoke and
ultraviolet light31, thought to arise due to higher order chromatin
organization and accessibility of the carcinogen and repair
proteins to DNA (ref. 32). Deletions found in radiation-naive
tumours showed considerable long-range variation in density
across the genome, as did insertions in both radiation-associated
and radiation-naive tumours, correlating with several genomic
features (Fig. 1d,e; Supplementary Data 4). In stark contrast,
deletions
in
radiation-induced
cancers
showed
almost
no
variability across the genome and minimal correlation with
genomic
properties
such
as
replication
timing,
sequence
complexity or GC content. We hypothesize that this is because
of the pervasive penetration of ionizing radiation through tissue,
meaning that its interaction with DNA is stochastic and
unaffected by higher order chromatin structure. Since small
deletions are the predominant read-out of this damage, they show
no association with the genomic features that influence other
mutational processes.
Evidence of non-homologous end-joining causing deletions. In
two
aspects,

cancers

 resembled those of BRCA1 or BRCA2 germline-deficient breast
tumours (Supplementary Fig. 2): enrichment for deletions 4
2–3 bp in length and significantly higher rates of microhomology
at the breakpoint junction (P ¼ 2 � 10 � 16, Kolmogorov–Smirnov
test)27. This similarity suggests that microhomology mediated or
non-homologous end-joining are the pathways for repairing
radiation-induced
DNA
damage,
rather
than
homologous
recombination. Possible explanations for this include that
damage occurs at phases of the cell cycle when homologous
recombination pathways are less active33 or because the damaged

 DNA ends contain structures that interfere with homologous
recombination34.
Enrichment of balanced inversions. For structural variants, we
found enrichment of a rare type of rearrangement, balanced
inversions, among radiation-associated second malignancies,
irrespective of tumour type (Table 1; Fig. 2). While rearrange-
ments with an inverted orientation are common in cancer
genomes, they are typically unbalanced, associated with copy-
number changes and caused by processes such as breakage-
fusion-bridge cycles35, chromothripsis29 and chromoplexy36. We
found a significant enrichment of balanced inversions in
radiation-associated cancers: 52 in 11/12 tumours compared
with 66 balanced inversions in 43 of the 286 radiation-naive
tumours studied (P ¼ 2 � 10 � 16, generalized linear model). Of
note,
complete
inversions
were
also
significantly
enriched
amongst BRCA1 and BRCA2 germline-deficient breast tumours
(Table 1, P ¼ 2 � 10 � 16). Balanced inversions ranged in size from
a few hundred base pairs to nearly 100 megabases, and at
breakpoint junctions showed variability in microhomology and in
non-templated sequence inserted (Supplementary Data 5).
Validation of findings in prostate tumours. To validate our
observation that deletions and balanced inversions are genomic
imprints of ionizing radiation, we examined the genomes of
primary and/or metastatic prostate tumours from ten patients,
previously published30. Five patients had developed metastases
after irradiation of the primary lesion; four patients had never
received radiation treatment; and one patient, PD11331, received
radiotherapy to the primary lesion after metastases had already
formed. Consistent with the observations made in the 12
radiation-associated second malignancies, we found a significant
enrichment of deletions in prostate cancer lesions exposed
to
radiotherapy
compared
with
radiation-naive
tumours’
(P ¼ 0.0002, generalized linear model, Fig. 3a). Strikingly, in
patient PD11331, the radiation-exposed primary tumour (sample
PD11331c), but not radiation-naive metastases, exhibited a
preponderance of deletions (Fig. 3b, P ¼ 10 � 15, Fisher’s exact
test). Similarly, balanced inversions were enriched amongst
radiation-exposed lesions (P ¼ 0.04, generalized linear model;
Supplementary Table 2). In patient PD11331, again it was the
radiation-exposed primary tumour, but not any of the metastases,
that harboured a balanced inversion.
Driver events generated by deletions and inversions. The
oncogenic potential of a mutational process derives from its
capacity to generate driver mutations. With their absence of
copy-number
effects,
functional
consequences
of
balanced
inversions most commonly arise from genes broken at either end
of the inversion, notwithstanding the possibility of long-range
gene-enhancer disruption. In our data, 48/104 inversion break
points disrupted or fused genes (Supplementary Data 5), with one
forming a driver mutation through disruption of TP53. For the
mutational signature of small deletions that we observe, we esti-
mate that the median excess of indels in the radiation-induced
cancers sequenced here is 201 indels per genome (linear mixed
effects model, s.d. 348 indels). Among these are a 14 base pair
deletion in CASP8 and a 4 base pair deletion in TP53, both
disrupting essential splice sites and thus generating driver events.
Discussion
Overall we identified two genomic imprints of ionizing radiation,
an excess of deletions and of an exceedingly rare type of
rearrangement, balanced inversions. The validity of our study
may be limited by the overall number of tumours we examined
and the small number of each tumour type. Yet it would seem
unlikely that the enrichment in radiation-associated tumours of
deletions and of balanced inversions occurred by chance. This
view is supported by our statistical analyses as well as the fact that
the signatures were tumour-type independent. Both signatures
were present across four different tumour types and could be
validated in a cohort of radiation-exposed prostate cancer lesions,
despite differences in the biological context of radiation-exposed
prostate tumours and radiation-associated second malignancies
(Supplementary Note 2). Particularly striking is patient PD11331
whose primary prostate lesion was irradiated after metastases had
formed. The primary lesion, but not the metastases, exhibited the
genomic features of ionizing radiation.
The relatively low number of mutations that we directly linked
to ionizing radiation may seem surprising for such a well-known
carcinogen. It is certainly considerably less than seen for cancers
associated with tobacco, sunlight or aristolochic acid exposure10.
This probably reflects the fact that although the attributable risk
of such cancers is high, the absolute risk is relatively low. For
example, 490% of angiosarcomas occurring after radiotherapy
for primary breast cancer are attributable to radiation, but only
one in a thousand women receiving such radiotherapy will
develop angiosarcomas37, with a latency of many years. This
suggests that although ionizing radiation clearly pushes bystander
cells in the radiotherapy field towards cancer, the absolute burden
of radiation-induced mutations per cell would not be high and
additional driver mutations would be required.

across different regions of the genome (horizontal axis). The probability was modelled on the basis of associations between indels and genomic properties
(see Methods). Chromosome 14 is shown as a representative chromosome. Radiation-associated indels were compared to indels of 35 non-radiation-
associated osteosarcomas. Radiation-associated deletions, but not insertions, followed a more uniform distribution across the genome than in radiation-
naive samples. (e) Distribution of indels in relation to genomic features. Comparison of the mutation density of radiation versus non-radiation indels in
relation to genomic features. X axis: ratio of mutation density of non-radiation-associated indels or radiation-associated indels over background density. Y
axis: genomic feature. The distribution of insertions in both radiation-associated and radiation-naı
¨ve tumours correlated with several genomic features, with
few significant differences (asterisk) between the two. In contrast, the distribution of deletions in radiation-induced cancers, but not in radiation-naive
tumours, showed little variability and resembled the background distribution more closely. Thus, significant differences (asterisk) were seen in the deletion
density in relation to genomic features comparing radiation-associated and radiation-naı
¨ve tumours. P-values are detailed in Supplementary Data 4.

Rearrangement catalogues of tumours were searched informatically for the presence of balanced inversions. The basic principle of the search was to find pairs of head-to-head and tail-to-tail inversions in
which the breakpoint coordinates overlap at both ends. Compared with all 286 primary tumours, balanced inversions were significantly enriched in radiation-associated second malignancies
(P ¼ 2 � 10 � 16, generalized linear model) and also in BRCA1 or BRCA1 deficient breast tumours (P ¼ 2 � 10 � 16, generalized linear model). Further, compared to BRCA1 or BRCA1 deficient breast tumours
balanced inversions were significantly enriched in radiation-associated second malignancies (P ¼ 0.0006, generalized linear model).

 Methods
Patient samples. Informed consent was obtained from all subjects and ethical
approval obtained from Cambridgeshire 2 Research Ethics Service (reference
09/H0308/165). Collection and use of patient samples were approved by the
appropriate institutional review board of each Institution.
Whole-genome sequencing. DNA was extracted from 12 radiation-associated
tumours and subjected to whole-genome sequencing, along with normal tissue
derived from the same individuals. All tumour samples had been freshly frozen and
were reviewed by reference pathologists. DNA extraction and preparation followed
standard methods as previously described38. Reads were aligned to the reference
human genome (NCBI37) by using BWA on default settings39. Reads which were
unmapped or PCR-derived duplicates were excluded from the analysis. The average
coverage of tumours was at least 40 � and of normal DNA 30 � , as per standard
set by the International Cancer Genome Consortium.
Variant detection. The CaVEMan (cancer variants through expectation max-
imization) algorithm was used to call single-nucleotide substitutions (github.com/
cancerit/CaVEMan). To call insertions and deletions, we used split-read mapping
implemented as a modification of the Pindel algorithm38. To call rearrangements
we applied the BRASS (breakpoint via assembly) algorithm, which identifies
rearrangements by grouping discordant read pairs that point to the same
breakpoint event (github.com/cancerit/BRASS). Post-processing filters were
applied to the output to improve specificity. Copy-number data were derived from
whole-genome reads using the ASCAT (version 2.2) algorithm40. Mutations were
annotated to Ensembl version 58.
Variant validation. The precision of indels and substitutions presented here was
assessed by manual inspection of 100 randomly selected substitutions and was
found to be at least of 90% across the 12 radiation-associated tumours. This
precision of coding indels and substitutions was confirmed by re-sequencing
through whole-exome sequencing. Structural rearrangements were validated by
defining exact break points through local reassembly, as implemented in BRASS.
Only rearrangements that could be validated have been included in this report
(listed individually in Supplementary Data 3).
Screen/validation of balanced inversions. Rearrangement catalogues were
screened for the presence of balanced inversions by means of a bespoke PERL
script. Pairs of rearrangement calls were sought that were inversions in opposite
directions with overlapping ranges of upper and lower break points. The search was
directly performed on output from the Brass algorithm with the following post-
processing filters: read count supporting the break point of greater than five reads
and size of inversion greater than 2,500 base pairs unless the read count supporting
the break point was greater than ten reads in which case no size threshold was
applied. This post-processing strategy removes inversion artefacts, which are small
and generally have a read count supporting the break point of less than five reads,
without excluding small, high confidence inversions (defined as break points
supported by at least ten reads). The precision of balanced inversion calls yielded
by this search were assessed in the 12 radiation-associated tumours. In all but one
balanced inversion, both rearrangements defining the inversion could be validated
by algorithmic local reassembly or manual split-read mapping. In addition, a
proportion of balanced inversions in 20/52 was subjected to PCR across the
breakpoint in stock DNA from tumour and normal tissue. These inversions were
all confirmed to be genuine and somatic (Supplementary Fig. 3).
Germline variants. Germline point mutations in TP53, BRCA1 and BRCA2 were
searched for in catalogues of germline indels and substitutions, as determined by
the point mutation variant calling algorithms employed here. Putative mutations
were compared against publicly available catalogues of pathogenic germline
mutations in these genes (www.iarc.fr).
Extraction of substitution signatures. Substitution signatures were extracted by
using non-negative matrix factorization, as previously described10.

Figure 3 | Indels in prostate tumours. (a) Indels in radiation-naive versus radiation-exposed prostate tumours. Shown is the indel burden, by indel
subtype, found in radiation-naive and in radiation-exposed prostate tumours. In radiation-exposed tumours radiotherapy had been administered to the
primary tumour before formation of metastases. Deletions were significantly enriched in radiation-exposed tumours (P ¼ 0.0002, generalized linear
model). Note that radiation-associated tumours with confounding BRCA1 or BRCA2 deficiency were excluded from the statistical analysis (cases PD13412
and PD11335). (b) Indels in tumours from a patient whose primary lesion was treated with ionizing radiation after formation of metastases. Shown are
indels that were found exclusively in the primary lesion and indels found in all other lesions. Deletions were significantly enriched amongst indels exclusive
to the primary lesion. Comparison by Fisher’s exact test, of the ratio of deletions over other indels.

 Subclonality analyses. Subclonal tumour cell populations that exist within
tumours can be screened for by searching for non-heterozygous mutations in
mutation catalogues, as previously described, using a Dirichlet process41. This was
applied to substitution and indel catalogues of the 12 radiation-associated whole
genomes. However, with indels there is a concern that mutant read frequencies
may be underestimated for larger indels, as reads containing larger indels may be
less amenable to mapping. To overcome this bias, the indel mutant read
frequencies were corrected by extracting unmapped reads (split reads) from
sequencing reads. The Dirichlet process was then applied to indel catalogues with,
and without, correction. The results in terms of number of subclonal peaks were
indistinguishable whether corrected or uncorrected indel catalogues were analysed.
Three of the twelve genomes screened for subclones contained subclones which
corresponded to subclones defined by substitutions in these tumours. Thus, the
indel-defined subclones were considered genuine. Indels were subdivided into
clonal (peak of mutation copy number B1) or subclonal (peak of mutation copy
number o1).
Non-radiation tumours. A total of 319 tumours, 284 breast cancers and 35
osteosarcomas were included for comparison in analyses. These were spontaneous
(primary), non-radiation-associated tumours. These tumours were sequenced to
B40 � or more, along with normal tissue DNA from the same patients.
These tumours were prepared, sequenced, analysed by the same pipeline as
the 12 radiation-associated tumours, including use of the same algorithms.
The osteosarcoma cases were a series of paediatric and adult tumours (sequencing
data published in the European Genome-phenome Archive, accession
EGAD00001000147). The breast tumours were comprised of oestrogen receptor
positive and negative tumours42. For the purposes of this analysis they were
subdivided into spontaneous cases (n ¼ 251) and those associated with pathogenic
germline BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation (n ¼ 33). No control primary angiosarcoma
and spindle cell sarcomas were available for inclusion in our analyses.
Association of mutation density with genomic features. The genomic
properties listed in Supplementary Table 3 were calculated at every variant
position, and, for comparison, at 100,000 random positions sampled uniformly
from the callable regions of hg19. Only chromosomes 1–22 and X were considered.
To test for differences in the genomic properties of variants in radiation-induced
versus non-radiation-induced tumours, we used a two-proportion z-test for the
binary variables, a t-test for the other quantitative variables (large sample size
justifies central limit theorem), and a w2-test for the categorical chromatin variable.
A Benjamini-Yekutieli correction was applied to the raw P-values to account for
multiple testing in the presence of likely correlation between these properties.
Genomic properties are considered significantly different between radiation and
non-radiation samples if the adjusted q-value is o0.01 and there is at least a 5%
difference in magnitude between the two group means.
Other statistical analyses. To assess whether radiation-associated tumours
harbour significantly more indels relative to substitutions and more deletions
relative to insertions, a mixed linear effects model was implemented using the
R package lme4. After incorporating as fixed effects type of mutation (substitution,
deletion and insertion) and group of tumour, interactions between tumour group
and type of mutation were assessed. For comparison of indel size distribution
underlying the clustering in Supplementary Fig. 2a, the statistic of the
Kolmogorov–Smirnov test was used (command in R: ks.test(x,y)$statistic). Unless
indicated, R was used for calculations.
