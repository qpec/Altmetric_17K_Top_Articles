ABSTRACT
OBJECTIVE
To determine if trimethoprim use for urinary tract 
infection (UTI) is associated with an increased risk of 
acute kidney injury, hyperkalaemia, or sudden death 
in the general population.
DESIGN
Cohort study.
SETTING
UK electronic primary care records from practices 
contributing to the Clinical Practice Research Datalink 
linked to the Hospital Episode Statistics database.
PARTICIPANTS
Adults aged 65 and over with a prescription for 
trimethoprim, amoxicillin, cefalexin, ciprofloxacin, 
or nitrofurantoin prescribed up to three days after a 
primary care diagnosis of UTI between April 1997 and 
September 2015.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES
The outcomes were acute kidney injury, 
hyperkalaemia, and death within 14 days of a UTI 
treated with antibiotics.
RESULTS
Among a cohort of 1 191 905 patients aged 65 and 
over, 178 238 individuals were identified with at 
least one UTI treated with antibiotics, comprising 
a total of 422 514 episodes of UTIs treated with 
antibiotics. The odds of acute kidney injury in 
the 14 days following antibiotic initiation were 
higher following trimethoprim (adjusted odds ratio 
1.72, 95% confidence interval 1.31 to 2.24) and 
ciprofloxacin (1.48, 1.03 to 2.13) compared with 
amoxicillin. The odds of hyperkalaemia in the 14 
days following antibiotic initiation were only higher 
following trimethoprim (2.27, 1.49 to 3.45) compared 
with amoxicillin. However, the odds of death within 
the 14 days following antibiotic initiation were not 
higher with trimethoprim than with amoxicillin: in 
the whole population the adjusted odds ratio was 
0.90 (95% confidence interval 0.76 to 1.07) while 
among users of renin-angiotensin system blockers the 
odds of death within 14 days of antibiotic initiation 
was 1.12 (0.80 to 1.57). The results suggest that, 
for 1000 UTIs treated with antibiotics among people 
65 and over, treatment with trimethoprim instead 
of amoxicillin would result in one to two additional 
cases of hyperkalaemia and two admissions with 
acute kidney injury, regardless of renin-angiotensin 
system blockade. However, for people taking renin-
angiotensin system blockers and spironolactone 
treatment with trimethoprim instead of amoxicillin 
there were 18 additional cases of hyperkalaemia and 
11 admissions with acute kidney injury.
CONCLUSION
Trimethoprim is associated with a greater risk of acute 
kidney injury and hyperkalaemia compared with 
other antibiotics used to treat UTIs, but not a greater 
risk of death. The relative risk increase is similar 
across population groups, but the higher baseline 
risk among those taking renin-angiotensin system 
blockers and potassium-sparing diuretics translates 
into higher absolute risks of acute kidney injury and 
hyperkalaemia in these groups.
Introduction
Co-trimoxazole is a combination antibiotic drug 
containing 
trimethoprim 
and 
sulfamethoxazole, 
prescribed for multiple indications and is the fourth 
most commonly prescribed antibiotic in the USA.1 
Its use has been associated with an increased risk of 
sudden death among people taking renin-angiotensin 
system blockers.2 3 This may be owing to acute kidney 
injury, a rapid deterioration in kidney function.4 
Alternately, co-trimoxazole and trimethoprim alone 
have both been associated with an increased risk of an 
acute rise in potassium levels, hyperkalaemia, which 
can cause fatal cardiac arrhythmias.3 5-8
Existing evidence has important limitations. It is not 
clear if the association between co-trimoxazole and 
adverse outcomes is owing to the sulfamethoxazole or 
the trimethoprim component. The observed association 
may be owing to confounding if the combination 
antibiotic was used for patients with more severe 
infections than the antibiotics it was compared with. 
Finally, existing evidence is primarily associated with 
specific groups of patients such as those taking renin-
angiotensin system blockers. In the UK, co-trimoxazole 
is licensed for specific, uncommon indications and 
trimethoprim is more commonly used. However,

Co-trimoxazole (a combination antibiotic drug containing trimethoprim and 
sulfamethoxazole) has been associated with an increased risk of sudden death, 
which may be mediated by increased serum potassium
Previous research is limited to specific patient groups (eg, patients taking renin-
angiotensin system blockers) and is limited by possible confounding by type and 
severity of infection
It is not known if the risks for trimethoprim are similar to those for co-trimoxazole

there are efforts to reduce trimethoprim prescribing 
due to increasing antimicrobial resistance.9 In 2015 
over 3.7 million prescriptions for trimethoprim were 
dispensed in England and it remains a first line option 
for treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections 
(UTIs).10 Despite this, whether trimethoprim alone is 
linked to sudden death both in the general population 
and in high risk groups is unknown.
Our study therefore aimed to investigate the 
association between trimethoprim and acute kidney 
injury, hyperkalaemia, or sudden death in a cohort 
of patients aged 65 and over. To limit confounding 
by antibiotic indication we restricted our analysis to 
patients with an antibiotic prescription for the same 
indication (UTI) and examined the risk of adverse 
outcomes in patients prescribed trimethoprim and 
four comparison antibiotics (amoxicillin, cefalexin, 
ciprofloxacin, and nitrofurantoin). However, even 
when treatment is restricted to the same indication, 
different classes of antibiotic drugs are prescribed 
in slightly different clinical scenarios. For simple 
UTIs in adults, current UK guidelines recommend 
nitrofurantoin as the first line treatment (except for 
patients with poor renal function) and trimethoprim 
as a first line alternative where there is low risk of 
microbial resistance.11 Ciprofloxacin and cefalexin 
are not currently recommended treatments for simple 
UTIs (although ciprofloxacin is a first line option for 
pyelonephritis) but are used for patients with resistance 
to first line antibiotics. In addition, ciprofloxacin and 
cefalexin were used in practice as treatment for simple 
UTIs during the years covered by this study.12 We 
aimed to address the impact of these different usage 
patterns on the outcomes through adjustment for a 
range of comorbidities and sensitivity analyses.
Methods
Study design and setting
We undertook a cohort study using electronic clinical 
records from adults attending primary care practices 
contributing to the UK Clinical Practice Research 
Datalink (CPRD GOLD) and linked hospital record data 
from the Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) database. 
CPRD is a database of primary care electronic health 
record data from participating general practices, 
covering 7% of the UK population.13 Included patients 
are largely representative of the UK population in 
terms of age, sex, ethnicity, and body mass index.13-15 
HES records cover all admissions for National Health 
Service (NHS) funded patients treated in either English 
NHS trusts or by independent providers.16 Seventy-five 
percent of English general practices included in CPRD 
are linked to HES data.13 The study period was from 1 
April 1997 to 30 September 2015 (the period covered 
by HES data linkage to CPRD).
Participants, exposures, and outcomes
We identified all adults aged 65 years and over during 
the study period (April 1997 to September 2015). 
We chose an older population as this is a clinically 
important group at high risk of adverse health 
outcomes. In addition, they are more likely to be well 
monitored, enabling reliable recording of comorbidities 
and quantification of baseline renal function.
Individuals were eligible for the study by receiving 
a prescription for an antibiotic for a urinary tract 
infection (UTI) after the latest of the following: 65th 
birthday; date practice reached CPRD quality control 
standards (to ensure data quality); or one year after 
practice registration date (to ensure that we had 
reliable measures of incident morbidity). Patients were 
no longer eligible to be included from the earliest of 
the following: date of death; left practice; or last data 
collection from practice. We excluded patients who 
developed end stage renal disease before they were 
eligible for inclusion.17
Exposures
The date of inclusion was the day of initiation for any 
of five antibiotic drugs (trimethoprim, amoxicillin, 
cefalexin, ciprofloxacin, and nitrofurantoin) recorded 
up to three days after a primary care morbidity code 
for uncomplicated UTI (ie, excluding more severe 
conditions such as pyelonephritis). We allowed a gap 
of three days between UTI diagnosis and treatment 
with an antibiotic to allow for delays between 
microbiological diagnosis and treatment. To ensure 
reliable measures of antibiotic exposure, we excluded 
any UTI episodes treated with antibiotics where two or 
more of the study antibiotics were prescribed on the 
same day. We excluded prescriptions for co-trimoxazole 
and did not include patients treated with co-amoxiclav 
in the amoxicillin comparison group as in the UK these 
drugs are prescribed for more severe or atypical UTIs. 
We also excluded any UTI episodes where a patient 
received one or more of the five study antibiotics in the 
14 days before the UTI record to ensure that we were 
identifying the first consultation for an episode of UTI. 
Finally, we excluded any UTI episodes where a code 
for a non-UTI infection was recorded in the three days 
before antibiotic prescription.
Outcomes
We investigated the outcomes acute kidney injury, 
hyperkalaemia, and death recorded within 14 days of 
antibiotic initiation for UTI. Acute kidney injury was 
defined as hospital admission with acute kidney injury 
using ICD-10 (international classification of diseases, 
10th revision) codes recorded in any diagnostic 
position of any inpatient episode starting within 14 
days of antibiotic initiation.17 18 Hyperkalaemia was 
identified in the 14 days after antibiotic initiation using 
morbidity coding in primary (Read codes) or secondary 
(ICD-10 codes) care, or a potassium level of 6 mmol/L 
or more recorded in primary care. Death was identified 
as the earliest record of death from Read codes in 
CPRD, CPRD defined death date, ICD-10 codes in HES, 
and the Office for National Statistics date of death.
All morbidity code lists are available to download,19 
and were either developed for use in other studies, 
or were developed in a consensus procedure by two 
authors with clinical experience in the NHS.

Covariates
Based on a priori knowledge, we considered the 
following variables as potential confounders of the 
relation between trimethoprim and acute kidney 
injury, hyperkalaemia, or sudden death: sex, age, 
calendar period, chronic comorbidities, history of 
renal or urological disease, baseline renal function, 
prescription for renin-angiotensin system blockers 
(including angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors 
and angiotensin receptor blockers) or potassium-
sparing diuretics, lifestyle factors (smoking, alcohol 
intake, and body mass index), ethnicity, and 
socioeconomic status. All covariates other than sex 
and ethnicity were updated over time.
Age group was defined in the following bands at 
time of antibiotic initiation: 65‚Äì69; 70‚Äì74; 75‚Äì79; 
80‚Äì84; and 85 and over.
We included calendar period (1997‚Äì2000, 2001‚Äì
04, 2005‚Äì08, 2009‚Äì11, and 2012‚Äì15) as a covariate 
to adjust for the many changes in clinical, diagnostic, 
and administrative practices over the study period 
that may influence the choice of antibiotic treatment 
for UTI, the measurement of renal function, and 
registration of outcomes.
Chronic comorbidities included as confounders were 
diabetes mellitus, ischaemic heart disease, cardiac 
failure, arrhythmia, and hypertension, identified from 
both primary care and hospital data. Individuals were 
considered to have a specific comorbidity if they had a 
code recorded in their electronic health records before 
a UTI episode treated with antibiotics.
Baseline renal function was defined using the most 
recent biochemical test results recorded in primary care 
at any time before each UTI treated with antibiotics. 
We used serum creatinine test results to calculate 
estimated glomerular filtration rate using the Chronic 
Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-
EPI) equation.20 We categorised estimated glomerular 
filtration rate into the following bands analogous to 
chronic kidney disease stages: 60 mL/min/1.73m2 and 
over; 45‚Äì59 mL/min/1.73m2; 30‚Äì44 mL/min/1.73m2; 
and less than 30 mL/min/1.73m2. This created possible 
selection bias since those at greater risk of renal disease 
are more likely to have renal function measured. 
Therefore, we included an absent renal function 
category for those with no recorded serum creatinine 
test result before UTI treated with antibiotics.
History of renal and urological disease were 
identified using primary care records and classified in 
the following categories: prostatic hypertrophy, renal 
calculi, urological malignancies, and renal structural 
anomalies. To identify historic diagnoses that may 
influence prescribing rather than a more immediate 
condition that may have caused the infection (and 
therefore potentially be on the causal pathway) we 
identified renal disease based on codes recorded 
more than a year before each UTI episode treated with 
antibiotics.
Exposure to renin-angiotensin system blockers 
or potassium-sparing diuretics was defined using 
prescription data as a current prescription at the 
time of a UTI treated with antibiotics and categorised 
as neither a renin-angiotensin system blocker nor a 
potassium-sparing diuretic, either a renin-angiotensin 
system blocker or a potassium-sparing diuretic, or 
renin-angiotensin system blockers in combination 
with potassium-sparing diuretics. We calculated 
prescription duration using the quantity of medication 
prescribed and daily dose recorded; when these 
data were not available, we assumed the population 
median prescription duration of 28 days. We assumed 
exposure to medications started on the date of the 
prescription. We constructed continuous courses 
of therapy by allowing for a gap of 60 days between 
consecutive prescriptions. We therefore defined a 
current prescription when a UTI episode treated with 
antibiotics occurred during a continuous course of 
drug therapy.
We used existing morbidity code lists and algorithms 
for ethnicity,14 smoking status, alcohol intake, and 
body mass index.15 A large proportion of ethnicity data 
were missing so we only adjusted for ethnicity as a 
covariate in sensitivity analyses.14 Lifestyle covariates 
(smoking, alcohol intake, and body mass index) were 
defined using the closest primary care record to the 
date of antibiotic prescription. Socioeconomic status 
was defined using general practice level quintiles of 
index of multiple deprivation scores. The effects of 
lifestyle covariates and socioeconomic status were 
thought to be largely captured by comorbidity data; 
we therefore only adjusted for these covariates in 
sensitivity analyses.
Statistical analysis
We calculated odds ratios for each outcome (acute 
kidney injury, hyperkalaemia, and death) within 14 
days of antibiotic initiation for a UTI comparing each 
antibiotic drug (trimethoprim, cefalexin, ciprofloxacin, 
and nitrofurantoin) to amoxicillin (as the reference 
category) adjusting for potential confounders using 
logistic regression. We used robust standard errors to 
account for clustering by general practice. Separately, 
we repeated the analyses using robust standard errors 
to account for clustering by patient to account for some 
patients contributing multiple UTI episodes to the 
analysis. We initially adjusted for sex and age only, and 
then fitted an adjusted model using sex, age, calendar 
period, chronic comorbidities, baseline renal function, 
history of renal or urological disease, and use of renin-
angiotensin system blockers and potassium-sparing 
diuretics.
Sensitivity analyses
We tested the impact of our antibiotic exposure 
definition by repeating the main analysis after: 
defining exposure as antibiotic prescription on the 
same day as a record of a UTI morbidity code; excluding 
prescriptions for antibiotics where the patient received 
an antibiotic in the 28 days before index infection; and 
limiting the analysis to the first recorded UTI treated 
with antibiotics for each individual during eligible 
follow-up. We then tested the impact of defining more

immediate outcomes by repeating the main analysis 
with all three outcomes defined within seven days 
(rather than 14 days) of index antibiotic initiation. 
We also repeated the main analysis additionally 
adjusting for lifestyle factors (smoking, alcohol intake, 
and body mass index) and socioeconomic status. We 
repeated the main analysis limiting to individuals who 
had ethnicity recorded in Clinical Practice Research 
Datalink (CPRD) or Hospital Episode Statistics (HES), 
and became eligible for study entry from 2006 when 
recording of ethnicity was rewarded in primary care 
leading to improvements in CPRD data completeness.14 
We included ethnicity both in the equation used to 
calculate estimated glomerular filtration rate and as 
covariate in the analysis. Next, to more closely replicate 
previous studies,2 3 5 21 we repeated the main analysis 
with the exposure defined as antibiotic prescription 
for any indication, and, separately, limiting to 
individuals who had a current prescription for a renin-
angiotensin system blocker at the time of UTI treated 
with antibiotics examining death both at seven and 
14 days. Finally, to ensure that we were comparing 
similar groups (to reduce confounding by indication), 
we examined the risks of all three outcomes after 
propensity score weighting (inverse probability of 
treatment weighting) of trimethoprim and amoxicillin 
users (full details in web appendix 1). In inverse 
probability of treatment weighting, patients are 
reweighted according to the inverse of their probability 
of receiving the treatment they actually received. The 
strength of inverse probability of treatment weighting 
compared with propensity score matching is that every 
patient is included in the analysis, whereas propensity 
score matching may lead to the exclusion of patients 
for which a good match cannot be found, therefore 
threatening the generalisability of the results.
All data management and analyses were performed 
using Stata version 14 (StataCorp, Texas, USA).
Patient involvement
No patients were involved in setting the research 
question or the outcome measures, nor were 
they involved in developing plans for design or 
implementation of the study. No patients were asked 
to advise on interpretation or writing up of results. We 
are not able to disseminate the results of the research 
directly to study participants because the data used 
were anonymised. 
Results
Study population
Figure 1 shows that among a cohort of 1 191 905 
patients aged 65 and over we identified 178 238 
individuals with a least one urinary tract infection 
(UTI) treated with antibiotics, comprising a total of 
422 514 episodes. Patients contributed a median of 
three UTIs treated with antibiotics (interquartile range 
2‚Äì7) during a mean follow-up period of 9.1 (SD 5.0) 
years. Table 1 shows that of these UTIs, 5% (n=22 543) 
were treated with amoxicillin, 59% (251 193) with 
trimethoprim, 15% (64 885) with cefalexin, 5% 
(21 946) with ciprofloxacin, and 15% (61 947) with 
nitrofurantoin. There were a total of 1345 episodes of 
acute kidney injury, 648 episodes of hyperkalaemia, 
and 2214 deaths within 14 days of antibiotic initiation 
for a UTI. The majority of cases of hyperkalaemia were 
identified from primary care biochemical test results; 
71% of all hyperkalaemia records within 14 days of 
a UTI treated with antibiotics were identified from 
test results, 18% were recorded using Read codes in 
primary care, and 11% from hospital records.
Table 1 shows the characteristics of patients at the 
time of antibiotic prescription for a UTI for the overall 
study population, and stratified by class of antibiotic 
prescribed. Amoxicillin or ciprofloxacin were more 
commonly used to treat UTIs in men and a slightly 
higher percentage of those prescribed amoxicillin 
were aged 85 and over. While the proportion of 
chronic comorbidities were broadly similar across 
the antibiotics, the patients prescribed trimethoprim 
had fewer comorbidities compared with amoxicillin. 
Individuals prescribed nitrofurantoin had better renal 
function (56% of UTIs treated with nitrofurantoin were 
in individuals with estimated glomerular filtration 
rate ‚â•60 mL/min/1.73m2, compared with 37% to 43% 
for other antibiotics). Ciprofloxacin was more likely 
to be prescribed for UTIs in patients with a history of 
prostatic hypertrophy or renal calculi (10% of patients 
prescribed ciprofloxacin had a history of prostatic 
hypertrophy compared with 5% to 6% for the other 
antibiotics, while 4% prescribed ciprofloxacin had a 
history of renal calculi compared with 2% to 3% for 
the other antibiotics).

injury, hyperkalaemia, or death

associated with the highest odds of acute kidney injury 
(adjusted odds ratio 1.72, 95% confidence interval 
1.31 to 2.24) and hyperkalaemia (2.27, 1.49 to 3.45) 
of all the antibiotics investigated. Ciprofloxacin was 
also associated with an increased odds of acute kidney 
injury (1.48, 1.03 to 2.13) but not of hyperkalaemia 
(1.17, 0.68 to 2.02). Cefalexin and nitrofurantoin were 
not associated with an increased odds of acute kidney 
injury or hyperkalaemia compared with amoxicillin. 
The odds of death within 14 days of antibiotic initiation 
for UTI were similar to amoxicillin for trimethoprim 
(0.90, 0.76 to 1.07) and the other antibiotics.
Sensitivity analyses
We saw minimal differences in the odds ratios for 
acute kidney injury, hyperkalaemia, or sudden death 
comparing trimethoprim, cefalexin, ciprofloxacin, or 
nitrofurantoin with amoxicillin after the majority of 
sensitivity analyses, or after additionally adjusting 
for lifestyle factors, ethnicity, and socioeconomic 
status (web appendix 1). Repeating the main analysis 
excluding patients without known baseline renal 
function made minimal differences to the results 
(web appendix 1). Redefining exposure as antibiotic 
prescription for any indication (rather than only 
for a UTI) increased the observed effect size of the 
association between trimethoprim and acute kidney 
injury: the odds ratio comparing trimethoprim 
with amoxicillin increased from 1.72 to 2.36 (95% 
confidence interval 2.22 to 2.51). There were 
minimal changes in the sizes of the association with 
hyperkalaemia and death. When the analysis was 
restricted to users of renin-angiotensin system blockers 
at the time of a UTI (as opposed to adjusting for these 
drugs as covariates), the risk of acute kidney injury and 
hyperkalaemia after trimethoprim use were similar to

the main analysis; adjusted odds ratio of 1.92 (1.29 to 
2.87) for acute kidney injury and 2.22 (1.34 to 3.68) 
for hyperkalaemia. While the point estimate for death 
comparing trimethoprim with amoxicillin among users 
of renin-angiotensin system blockers was higher than 
among the whole population, confidence intervals 
were wide; within 14 days adjusted odds ratio for 
death was 1.12 (0.80 to 1.57). To enable comparison 
with other studies we counted the number of people 
prescribed renin-angiotensin system blockers who 
died with codes specifically suggestive of sudden death 
(I46, R96, R98, and R99) in the 14 days after antibiotic 
initiation. However, this included only six people so we 
were unable to analyse this outcome.
Finally, analyses using multivariable regression and 
inverse probability treatment weighting approaches 
comparing trimethoprim with amoxicillin users 
(prescribed for a UTI) were consistent with those from 
the main analysis (web appendix 1).
discussion
Our results show that in older patients in the general 
population, regardless of use of renin-angiotensin 
system blockers or potassium-sparing diuretics, 
treatment with trimethoprim for a urinary tract 
infection (UTI) is associated with a 72% increase in 
the odds of acute kidney injury and a greater than 
doubling of the odds of hyperkalaemia compared 
with amoxicillin. We also show that ciprofloxacin is 
associated with a 48% increase in the odds of acute 
kidney injury compared with amoxicillin. In contrast, 
no antibiotic was associated with increased risk of 
death within 14 days compared with amoxicillin. The 
relative risks of acute kidney injury, hyperkalaemia, 
and death were similar in the general population and 
among those prescribed renin-angiotensin system 
blockers after trimethoprim use for a UTI.
Strengths and weaknesses of this study
This is the first study to quantify the association of 
trimethoprim with these outcomes, for an unselected 
general population cohort after a UTI. Our study used a 
large number of routine, prospectively collected clinical 
records from a UK general practice database that is 
broadly representative of the UK population.13 Our 
results are therefore generalisable to all patients aged 
65 and over, in contrast to previous research restricted 
to select populations (eg, patients taking renin-
angiotensin system blockers and potassium-sparing 
diuretics).2 3 21 We have investigated the risk of adverse 
outcomes after taking antibiotics prescribed for a UTI, 
thereby reducing the confounding by indication that 
has limited previous research.2-5 21 As we investigated 
the effect of trimethoprim alone, we can be clear about 
the likely causative agent compared with research on 
the combination product co-trimoxazole.
However, there are some important limitations. While 
we attempted to capture only simple UTIs (defined using 
primary care morbidity coding, but not excluding those 
with a history of more complex urological pathology) in 
our main analysis, we may have included patients with 
underlying urinary tract disorders, or other infections. 
Since different classes of antibiotic drugs are prescribed 
for different clinical scenarios, some degree of 
confounding by indication is unavoidable. However, we 
were able to reduce confounding by robustly defining 
and adjusting for variables that may have influenced 
the choice of antibiotic drug prescribed such as baseline 
renal function. As trimethoprim was less frequently 
prescribed for patients with urological pathology, this 
would likely have led to underestimating the odds of 
adverse outcomes, particularly acute kidney injury, for 
trimethoprim compared with the true result. Similarly, 
clinicians may have been cautious in prescribing 
trimethoprim to those at highest risk of acute kidney 
injury and hyperkalaemia, again leading to an 
underestimation of the true risk of adverse outcomes, 
particularly for those taking renin-angiotensin system 
blockers. However, the strongest evidence of adverse 
outcomes in association with trimethoprim use for 
those taking renin-angiotensin system blockers was 
only published towards the end of the period of this 
study.2 21
Our assessment of antibiotic exposure was based 
on prescriptions alone and patients may not have 
collected or taken their medicine. This may have led 
to differential misclassification owing to the severity of 
the infection, with resulting over or under estimation 
of the true effect size. However, we have attempted to 
mitigate for this by limiting the study to simple UTIs 
and adjusting, in particular, for history of renal or 
urological disease.
We may also have misclassified the outcomes.

awareness of this physiological effect may have led 
clinicians to incorrectly diagnose acute kidney injury 
among the trimethoprim treated group, particularly 
given the current focus on creatinine based definitions 
of acute kidney injury. However, our definition of 
acute kidney injury relied on clinical coding of 
hospital admissions. In general, this leads to under 
ascertainment compared with analyses of serial 
creatinine tests but disproportionately captures more 
severe acute kidney injury.23 In addition, the increased 
risk of acute kidney injury dated back to 2001-04, 
before creatinine based definitions of acute kidney 
injury were in common use. It is also possible that 
there was a bias towards testing for or recording acute 
kidney injury or hyperkalaemia among patients taking 
trimethoprim if clinicians were aware of a potential 
association which would have led to an overestimation 
of the true risk of adverse outcomes.
Results in context
Multiple historic case reports and case series have 
implicated co-trimoxazole as a cause of reduced 
renal function,8 24 interstitial nephritis,25 26 or acute 
tubular necrosis.27 Among patients receiving co-
trimoxazole in hospital, 6% developed a creatinine 
based definition of acute kidney injury that was 
attributed to the antibiotics.4 However, we believe 
our study to be the first to show and quantify an 
association between trimethoprim alone and acute 
kidney injury in the general population. This is an 
important distinction as the sulphonamide antibiotics 
(including 
sulfamethoxazole) 
have 
been 
long 
recognised to be associated with a substantial risk 
of acute renal impairment, which could have been 
assumed to be causal.28 Our finding of an association 
of ciprofloxacin with acute kidney injury is similar to 
another population based study that showed that users 
of fluoroquinolones had a 2.18-fold (95% confidence 
interval 1.74 to 2.73) higher rate of acute kidney 
injury.29 However, ciprofloxacin is recommended for 
treatment of pyelonephritis, so an association with 
acute kidney injury may be due to confounding by 
severity of infection.
An association between both co-trimoxazole, or 
trimethoprim alone, with hyperkalaemia is well reported, 
particularly in association with renin-angiotensin 
system blockers.3 7 8 30-33 Our results suggest that, 
regardless of other drug use (renin-angiotensin system 
blockers or potassium-sparing diuretics), trimethoprim 
(but not ciprofloxacin), is associated with a more than 
doubling of the odds of hyperkalaemia. There is an 
additional increase in the odds of hyperkalaemia after 
a UTI for those prescribed renin-angiotensin system 
blockers, and greater than sixfold increase in association 
with concomitant use of a potassium-sparing diuretic, 
regardless of antibiotic choice. Our findings are in 
keeping with those of a Canadian nested case-control 
study of older patients taking renin-angiotensin system 
blockers that identified a nearly sevenfold increased 
risk of hospital admission for hyperkalaemia with co-
trimoxazole compared with other antibiotic drugs.3
This cohort covers the years 1997-2015, and we have 
shown a progressive increase in the odds of developing 
hyperkalaemia and acute kidney injury after a UTI 
in more recent years. The increase in hyperkalaemia 
may be due to an increased rate of blood testing in 
primary care (particularly among groups at risk of 
high potassium levels, such as patients with diabetes 
or chronic kidney disease) or improved automatic 
recording of test results in general practice records. 
The marked increase in acute kidney injury over time 
as defined by Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) coding 
is well established and likely to be predominantly 
related to increased clinical focus and the adoption of 
consensus definitions defined by changes in creatinine 
levels.34 35 By adjusting for calendar period we aimed 
to minimise the influence of these secular trends on 
our results.
In contrast to previous studies, we did not identify 
an increased risk of death from any cause in users of 
trimethoprim. The two previous papers that identified 
an increased risk of sudden death among users 
of renin-angiotensin system blockade taking co-
trimoxazole, used a case-control design with cases 
defined by sudden death, among residents of Ontario 
over 18 years of follow-up.2 21 They were therefore well 
powered for this outcome. We chose all cause death 
as a prespecified analysis owing to lack of power for 
cause specific death, since we restricted the cohort to 
patients with a UTI to address issues of confounding 
by indication for antibiotic choice that had limited 
previous research. In addition, since our cohort was 
not restricted to users of renin-angiotensin system 
blockers, the overall risk of sudden death was likely to 
be lower in our study. However, acknowledging these 
limitations, our findings of an odds ratio of death 
(comparing trimethoprim with amoxicillin) within 
seven days of a UTI of 1.51 (95% confidence interval 
0.87 to 2.65) among users of renin-angiotensin system 
blockers are consistent with those of Fralick et al 
(adjusted odds ratio 1.38, 95% confidence interval 
1.09 to 1.76).2 However, our study also had greater 
ability to adjust for detailed characteristics, such as 
estimated glomerular filtration rate before UTI, which 
are likely to have reduced residual confounding. While 
we cannot exclude a small increase in the odds of 
sudden death after trimethoprim use among users of 
renin-angiotensin system blockers, we have found no 
evidence of an association between trimethoprim use 
and death in the whole population of older adults, 
and sudden death is a rare outcome (1.1% (6 in 542) 
of total deaths within 14 days of antibiotic initiation 
among users of renin-angiotensin system blockers).
Clinical implications
Recent national prescribing guidance recommends 
nitrofurantoin as the first line choice for treating 
UTIs in adults, with trimethoprim an equivalent 
choice for those with low risk of antimicrobial 
resistance, meaning that trimethoprim will continue 
to be commonly prescribed.10 Current British National

mention an unquantified risk of hyperkalaemia (but 
not acute kidney injury), and a possible increase in 
risk if given with angiotensin-converting-enzyme 
(ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin-receptor antagonists, 
and spironolactone.36 Given the different rates of 
outcomes within subgroups of the population, it is 
useful to consider absolute and relative risk together 
by calculating the excess number of events attributable 
to trimethoprim treatment, although our very strict 
definition of a UTI means that these estimates should be 
treated with caution. As an example, our results suggest 
that for 1000 UTI episodes treated with antibiotics in 
those aged 65 and over not taking renin-angiotensin 
system blockers, treatment with trimethoprim, instead 
of amoxicillin, would result in one additional case 
of hyperkalaemia and two of acute kidney injury. 
Among those taking either renin-angiotensin system 
blockers or potassium-sparing diuretics the figures 
would be very similar; two additional cases of both 
hyperkalaemia and acute kidney injury. However, 
treatment with both renin-angiotensin system blockers 
and potassium-sparing diuretics would result in 18 
additional cases of hyperkalaemia and 11 of acute 
kidney injury.
A small increased absolute risk of a rare outcome 
(such as in the general population) from trimethoprim 
may be acceptable when set against a need for multiple 
treatment options for patients with allergy to other 
antibiotics or bacterial resistance patterns. While 
acute kidney injury and hyperkalaemia may result 
in avoidable morbidity and hospital admission, it is 
reassuring that we have not identified an increased risk 
of death, suggesting that there is appropriate response 
to these outcomes. Our results show that trimethoprim 
continues to be prescribed to people at high risk of 
adverse outcomes including patients with advanced 
renal impairment and those taking renin-angiotensin 
system blockers with potassium-sparing diuretics. 
For groups at high risk of acute kidney injury and 
hyperkalaemia, other antibiotics should be considered, 
but, if this is not possible, monitoring of renal function 
and potassium levels should be performed, in line 
with the existing summary of product characteristics 
for trimethoprim. 
Conclusion
Our results show that trimethoprim is associated with 
greater risk of acute kidney injury and hyperkalaemia 
compared with other antibiotic drugs for a UTI, among 
the general population aged 65 and over, and not just 
those treated with renin-angiotensin system blockers. 
However, this is not associated with an increased risk 
of death.
