Abstract: Background: Current literature supports the comprehensive health benefits of exposure
to nature and green environments on human systems. The aim of this state-of-the-art review is to
elucidate empirical research conducted on the physiological and psychological effects of Shinrin-Yoku
(or Forest Bathing) in transcontinental Japan and China. Furthermore, we aim to encourage healthcare
professionals to conduct longitudinal research in Western cultures regarding the clinically therapeutic
effects of Shinrin-Yoku and, for healthcare providers/students to consider practicing Shinrin-Yoku to
decrease undue stress and potential burnout. Methods: A thorough review was conducted to identify
research published with an initial open date range and then narrowing the collection to include
papers published from 2007 to 2017. Electronic databases (PubMed, PubMed Central, CINAHL,
PsycINFO and Scopus) and snowball references were used to cull papers that evaluated the use of
Shinrin-Yoku for various populations in diverse settings. Results: From the 127 papers initially culled
using the Boolean phrases: “Shinrin-yoku” AND/OR “forest bathing” AND/OR “nature therapy”,
64 studies met the inclusion criteria and were included in this summary review and then divided into
“physiological,” “psychological,” “sensory metrics” and “frameworks” sub-groups. Conclusions:
Human health benefits associated with the immersion in nature continue to be currently researched.
Longitudinal research, conducted worldwide, is needed to produce new evidence of the relationships
associated with Shinrin-Yoku and clinical therapeutic effects. Nature therapy as a health-promotion
method and potential universal health model is implicated for the reduction of reported modern-day
“stress-state” and “technostress.”.
Keywords: Shinrin-Yoku; forest bathing; nature therapy; integrative medicine
1. Introduction
Research conducted in transcontinental Japan and China points to a plethora of positive health
benefits for the human physiological and psychological systems associated with the practice of
Shinrin-Yoku (SY), also known as Forest Bathing FB (FB) [1–3]. SY is a traditional Japanese practice
of immersing oneself in nature by mindfully using all five senses. During the 1980s, SY surfaced
in Japan as a pivotal part of preventive health care and healing in Japanese medicine [4]. The
reported research findings associated with the healing components of SY specifically hones in on
the therapeutic effects on: (1) the immune system function (increase in natural killer cells/cancer
prevention); (2) cardiovascular system (hypertension/coronary artery disease); (3) the respiratory
system (allergies and respiratory disease); (4) depression and anxiety (mood disorders and stress);
(5) mental relaxation (Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder) and; (6) human feelings of “awe”
(increase in gratitude and selflessness) [5]. Moreover, various contemporary hypotheses, such as:
Kaplan’s Attention Restorative Hypothesis [6]; Ulrich’s Stress Reduction Hypothesis [7]; and Kellert

and Wilson’s Biophilia Hypothesis [8] provide support and a lens for the practice of SY and other
forms of nature engagement.
Furthermore, SY may be considered a form of Nature Therapy (NT). Song, Ikei and Miyazaki’s
present day model: Concept of Nature Therapy (CNT) [9] clearly defines NT as “a set of practices
aimed at achieving ‘preventive medical effects’ through exposure to natural stimuli that render a state
of physiological relaxation and boost the weakened immune functions to prevent diseases” [9]. The
conceptual model of NT starts with a “stressed state” at the top and then points to the “restorative
effects” of nature (forests, flowers, etc.) where there is a hypothesis of improvement in “physiological
relaxation” and “immune function recovery” responses (individual differences noted). These responses
to nature are then incorporated in the Evidence Based Medicine (EBM) model and is illustrated
by an arrow leading to the “preventive medical effect.” This clear model supports Song, Ikei and
Miyazaki’s [9] review of some medically proven outcomes.

with exposure to naturally occurring stimuli (all 5 senses) that has a direct effect on increasing
the parasympathetic nervous system and a heightened awareness that leads to a state of relaxation

Individuals living and interacting in green spaces (GS) report being more energetic, in good 
overall health and, have more of a sense of meaningful purpose in life [10]. Current scientific findings 
are illuminating what humans intuitively know: nature has great benefits for the human brain and 
this is shown through increased happiness, health/well-being and cognition [5]. Historically 
speaking, Cyrus the Great intuitively built lush green gardens in the crowded urban capital of Persia 
2500 years ago to increase human health and promote a sense of “calm” in a busy city. The 16th 
Century Swiss-German physician, Paracelsus, declared: “The art of healing comes from nature, not 
from the physician” [5]. These insights have lead SY researchers to investigate the modern health 
benefits of humans being exposed to nature or GS.  
Several studies explored the therapeutic benefits of SY in Asian countries [2,3,9,11]. 
Physiological and psychological differences between participants in a “forest therapy (FT)” program 
and a control were examined in the Seoul Metropolitan area with findings of a significant reduction 
in chronic widespread pain and depression [3]. Song and colleagues [9] demonstrated how male 
Japanese students who walked 15-min in an urban park during the autumn season had decreased 
stress and heart rates. By using several valid psychological tests, researchers demonstrated the 
positive effects of FT on individuals coping with chronic side effects of a cerebral vascular accident - 
specifically anxiety and depression [2]. At the Center for Environment, Health, and Field Sciences, 
Chiba University, Japan, researchers measured oxyhemoglobin levels in the pre-frontal cortexes of 
research participants while the participants observed three dracaena plants [11]. Results indicated a

Japan, researchers measured oxyhemoglobin levels in the pre-frontal cortexes of research participants
while the participants observed three dracaena plants [11]. Results indicated a significant increase in
participants’ oxyhemoglobin levels for urban, domestic and workplace foliage effects which directly
demonstrates the health-promotion effects associated with indoor foliage plants on humans [11].
While exploring recent research about the health benefits associated with SY a dearth of scientific
research conducted in Western populations was determined. Therefore, the increasing interest and the
current published significant research findings surrounding the healing benefits related to SY, GS and
the wilderness offers healthcare professionals an opportunity to delve deeper into this complementary
modality for the prevention of disease and to assist with the potential healing of certain existing
conditions in Western cultures. Revealing current research methods and subsequent research outcomes
associated with SY practices may provide researchers, clinicians and students with an intervention that
assists with preventative medicine and evidence-based practice (EBP). Therefore, the aim of this paper
is to offer: (a) an in-depth inquiry of the current literature, (b) invite researchers residing in Western
cultures to design and conduct empirical research regarding the therapeutic benefits associated with
SY and, (c) to encourage healthcare providers/students to consider practicing SY to decrease undue
stress and potential disconnection.
2. Materials and Methods
Review Method
The terms of this comprehensive review were to emphasize the core elements of the research
proposition. The initial literature search was conducted with the intention of identifying publications
that offered significant historic relevance to the practice of SY, included various populations, sample
sizes and geographic locales, utilized evidence-based practices, illustrated measurable physiological
and psychological effect parameters, expounded upon practical frameworks and methodologies for the
practice of SY, explicated unique measurable criteria for the application of SY and deduced limitations
of previous research.
Search Method
The electronic databases searched included PubMed Central, PubMed, CINAHL, Scopus, and
PsycINFO (Figure 2). Hand searched bibliographies and reference lists from seminal researchers of
SY were also applied to the initial culling of publications. PubMed Central was searched to ensure
the incorporation of relevant publications not indexed in PubMed. Keywords were used for each
database and during snowball searches. All titles and abstracts were searched with the following
terms: “shinrin-yoku,” “forest bathing,” and “nature therapy.” These searches were combined with the
Boolean operators AND/OR. These terms were chosen from careful analyses of supporting literature.
For example, the aforementioned terms “nature therapy”, “shinrin-yoku”, and “forest therapy” are
used in conjunction with one another in the most recent scholarly literature review of NT in Japan [9].
To remain prescient, the reference range utilized in this review included literature published
between the years 2007 and 2017. Therefore, the inclusion criteria allowed for publications that were
available in English, dated from 2007 to 2017, incorporated transparent evidence based practices in
reviews or trials, included robust quantitative and/or qualitative data, offered unique frameworks
and theories, and explored current trends in research. Studies not meeting the tenets of this criteria,
specifically those that pertained to physical exercise, fitness, landscape architecture, and laboratory, or
animal studies were withdrawn from considerations.

3. Results 
The findings of all relevant studies were synthesized (Table 1). The initial literature search 
revealed a series of topical themes apropos of the research aim. Articles were grouped into categories 
reflecting upon their most pertinent features. These categories include Background information, 
Frameworks, Physiological and Psychological effects, Sensory Metrics, and Limitations to findings. 
Previous Systematic Reviews and Literature Reviews were identified. Characteristics of publications 
specific to the themes of Physiological and Psychological Effects (PP), Sensory Metrics (SM), which is 
a subtopic of PP, and Frameworks (F) are delineated, an explicated within the key in Table 1.  
3.1. Physiological and Psychological (PP) Effects 
Livni [12] published an editorial on the health benefits of SY and described the historic trends in 
biophysical and psychosocial research. While news of the beneficial elements of SY has been 
gathering momentum in popular lexicon, it has been the robustness of pioneering research, largely 
from Japanese scholars, that illuminates empirical links between the PP effects of SY. Tsunetsugu, 
Park and Miyazaki [13] conducted a novel review representing a didactic integration of various 
parameters specific to central nervous system (CNS) activity biomarkers; heart-rate variability 
(HRV), salivary cortisol levels (SCL), immunoglobulin A (IgA) and sense-specific metrics.  
Of the studies included within the PP section, and irrespective of study aims, there was a trend 
towards small sample sizes, gender and age homogeneity, and skewed ratios of females to males/vice 
versa, which by either methods of convenience, purpose and/or imparted bias to the research. An 
overwhelming number of studies included homogenous gender sampling [14–27]. Population 
demographics specific to gender were unreported in [28–30]. Proportionately skewed ratios of male

3.1. Physiological and Psychological (PP) Effects
Livni [12] published an editorial on the health benefits of SY and described the historic trends
in biophysical and psychosocial research. While news of the beneficial elements of SY has been
gathering momentum in popular lexicon, it has been the robustness of pioneering research, largely
from Japanese scholars, that illuminates empirical links between the PP effects of SY. Tsunetsugu, Park
and Miyazaki [13] conducted a novel review representing a didactic integration of various parameters
specific to central nervous system (CNS) activity biomarkers; heart-rate variability (HRV), salivary
cortisol levels (SCL), immunoglobulin A (IgA) and sense-specific metrics.
Of the studies included within the PP section, and irrespective of study aims, there was a
trend towards small sample sizes, gender and age homogeneity, and skewed ratios of females to
males/vice versa, which by either methods of convenience, purpose and/or imparted bias to the
research. An overwhelming number of studies included homogenous gender sampling [14–27].
Population demographics specific to gender were unreported in [28–30]. Proportionately skewed
ratios of male to females and vice versa were identified in these studies [31–36]. Studies may have
been limited to research participants specific to the student body of the courses and facilities within
which the research was designed. The aspects of cultural specificities and sensitivity in research
design must be considered when approaching a literature review from a global lens. The methods,
tests, and findings of 40 relevant publications expounding upon the PP indices are included in this
review. These publications are further assorted into Heart-rate Metrics; Disease States; Autonomic
Nervous System Effects; Endocrine Function; and Sense Metrics. The multitudinous reasons for natural
environs generating the aforementioned positive qualities have been systematically incorporated into
the investigation of the physiological and psychological effects of SY as follows.
3.2. Heart-Rate Metrics
As changes in cardiac function, revealed by cardiac monitoring, are correlational to the
physiological effects of stress regardless of environmental setting, it is coherently expected more
than one third of the articles reviewed observe not only standard vital signs, including heart rate (HR)
and pulse rate (PR), systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP/DBP) and ECG interpretation, but
also heart rate variability (HRV), as well as left ventricular function and right ventricular function
(LVF/RVF). While LVF is attributed to the ability of the left ventricle to perfuse the body, RVF is related
to pumping blood to the lungs. HRV is defined as the variation in the time interval between heartbeats
and is associated with the activation of the parasympathetic nervous system (PNS) through high
frequencies (HF) and the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) through low frequencies (LF).
The trends revealed by SY research over the past 10 years in relation to the cardiovascular
and autonomic nervous systems (ANS) appears to have started with basic cardiac monitoring then
shifted to the correlation of cardiac monitored data points with the PNS and SNS, and this started the
development of a more in-depth study design to research the effects of SY on specific disease states,
such as: hypertension (HTN), coronary artery disease (CAD), and chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease (COPD).
According to Kobayashi, Song, Ikei, Song, Kagawa and Miyazaki [18], 625 Japanese males situated
in 57 forest-sites and 57 urban-sites across Japan revealed an 80% increase in the parasympathetic
indicators of HRV while experiencing the forest setting—physiologically demonstrating forest-viewing
was more effective in reducing indicators of stress than in the urban participants. The methods and
findings of this large sample study are grounded in some of the earlier pilot studies culled for this
review. In Park et al. [37] quantitative study, the sample size was limited to 12 males; however, it was
one of the earliest studies to interpret the R-R intervals of the electrocardiogram analyzing pulse rate,
in addition to SBP/DBP and LF/HF) components of HRV. This study design [37] has been echoed
throughout multiple studies which limit physical activity levels to 20-min for each activity researched in
order to control for the cardiovascular effects of physical exertion on each participant [19,22,27,38–41].
 Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2017, 14, 851

Blood pressure and PR also decreased while in the forest settings compared to the urban settings.
In comparison to physical exercise tasks, Lee, Lee, Park and Miyazaki [20] measured HR and BP
in relation to synthetic versus organic stimulation. This study revealed both HR and BP decreased
in participants after they had completed a garden transplanting task compared with participants’
HR and BP gradual increase throughout a computer performance task. Similar to the findings of
Tsunetsugu et al. [40] consisting of 12 males, a study of 17 females over the age of 40 by Ochiai et al. [25]
revealed an overall decrease in HR after one day of a “forest-therapy program”. These studies
demonstrate cardiovascular benefits for both genders. After controlling for both demographic and
socioeconomic factors, Kardan et al. [42] conducted a correlation analyses of data acquired through the
Canadian Ontario Health Study. High resolution satellite imagery suggests residents of neighborhoods
with a higher density of trees on the streets report less ill cardio-metabolic conditions than do residents
of neighborhoods with less trees. Thematically, it is evident the cardiovascular (CV) benefits of
SY are apparent regardless of age, gender, socioeconomic background, or previous exposure to a
nature setting.
3.3. Physiological Disease States
Significant research has revealed the effects of SY and NT on specific physiological disease states,
including HTN, CAD, COPD, and Diabetes Mellitus Type II (DMII). In a randomized control trial
(RCT) of 24 adults with HTN, Mao et al. [29] found throughout a week-long trip to a nature setting, BP
indicators, and CV disease-related pathological factors decreased the activation of the renin-angiotensin
system, therefore reducing the workload of the heart and helping to manage the symptoms of HTN. In a
RCT of 20 Lithuanian adult patients with CAD, Grazuleviciene et al. [43] found after a week of 30-min
sessions in nature, the participants’ cardiac function improved overall. This is a groundbreaking
study in there has never been a study prior to their publication that addressed “cardiovascular
relaxation and recovery of homeostasis in CAD patients.” Jia et al. [44] found a decrease of perforin
and granzyme B expressions accompanied by decreased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and
stress hormones in 20 patients diagnosed with COPD indicating some of the potential health benefits
of SY for individuals living with COPD. Furthermore, in a longitudinal study of 48 adults diagnosed
with DMII, Ohtsuka [45] found blood glucose readings declined after multiple SY practice sessions,
therefore indicating a significant correlation between SY and the reduction of blood glucose levels.
This study is one of the few measuring the effects of SY over time, which indicates further research
may be conducted to confirm the long-term effects of SY, not only for its effects on patients with DMII,
but for patients with different disease states as well [23,29,43–45].
3.4. Psychological
Morita et al. [46] noted while SY has been popularized in Japan given the ease of access to
forested environments and its’ conscientious governmental recommendations, individuals globally
have reduced acute psychological distress from time spent in greenspace (Figure 3).
Furthermore, Morita et al. [46] investigated SY’s effect on 498 Japanese residents suffering from
acute and chronic stress. Of these research participants, those suffering from chronic stress states
reported the greatest reduction in subjective feelings of hostility, depression and anxiety as a direct
result of time spent in the forested environs. Additionally, a RCT reflecting this practice, Sung et al. [47]
developed a Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) based on a FT program, which included educational
sessions and guided FB activities for middle-aged men and women diagnosed with Stage I HTN in
South Korea. The CBT FT program incorporated elements of meditation and relaxation techniques
in chosen forested environments, as well as participant self-reflection and goal setting [47]. The
results of which demonstrated a significant decrease in the salivary cortisol (tested as a biomarker of
stress), increase in Quality of Life (via the QoL questionnaire) and a decrease in anxiety. However,
this study also gleaned a transient effect in the reduction of individual’s manual self-reported BP
measures. Self-reported manual BP reports are subject to reliability issues of measurement and bias.

Moreover, the lack of additional objective analysis in the short-term forest-environment exposure are
identified confounding variables, as well as the fact the participants took prescribed antihypertensive
medications throughout the trials in the intervention and control groups respectively [47].

measurement and bias. Moreover, the lack of additional objective analysis in the short-term forest-
environment exposure are identified confounding variables, as well as the fact the participants took 
prescribed antihypertensive medications throughout the trials in the intervention and control groups 
respectively [47].  
A hallmark of SY research has been the investigation of its’ relaxation inducing properties and 
application for ameliorating psychological distress. Within this review, 12 studies specifically 
addressed psychological disorders/disease states and relevant comorbid conditions with popular 
reference to stress and stress related heart disease, emotional distress and chronic depression, 
alcoholism, sleep disorders, and pain [5,6,26,30–33,47–51]. Takayama et al. [49] noted the impetus for 
their SY research stemmed from a growing concern for overworked urban dwellers’ chronic stressors. 
The results of this comparative study, while limited by sampling bias regarding the subject 
population consisting entirely of males, indicated a unanimous preference for forest walks versus 
urban walks based upon data synthesized from participants’ responses to the Profile of Mood States 
(POMS), Restorative Outcome Scale (ROS) and Subjective Vitality Scale (SVS) pre- and post-intervention.

data synthesized from participants’ responses to the Profile of Mood States (POMS), Restorative
Outcome Scale (ROS) and Subjective Vitality Scale (SVS) pre- and post-intervention. Stress from urban
environments caused by surmounting noise and environmental pollution, commuter traffic, financial
expenses, increasing tasks, and lack of proximity to FB environs/attributes motivated Park et al. [26]
to investigate the connection between psychological distress and greenspace accessibility. This study
which included a large, single-sex sample of 168 males between the ages of to 20 to 24 years of age,
demonstrated subjects’ preferences for forested environments, specifically in relation to temperature,
as demonstrated by participants’ reported lower Predicted Percentage Dissatisfied (PPD) scores related
to summer climes within forested environs compared with higher air temperature and heat indexes in
urban environments [26].
Citing the impact of chronic stress on growing populations with insomnia and poor sleep patterns
in Japan, Morita et al. [32] studied forest-walking to induce relaxation and improve general sleep-wake
cycles in a population of 71 men and women over the course of three months. Participants reported a
statistically significant correlation between increased sleep time (from an average of 365.9 ± 89.4 min
to 419.8 ± 128.7 min) post 2-h afternoon forest walks with decreased anxiety.
McCaffrey, Hansen and McCaffrey [30] investigated garden walking to reduce severity of signs
and symptoms of depression in older adults. Participants’ personal stories citing the emotionally
healing attributes of the natural surroundings and garden walking paths at the Morikami Japanese
Museum and Gardens in Delray Beach Florida, USA inspired the aforementioned researchers. Similarly,
 Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2017, 14, 851
38 of 48
Kim, Lim, Chung and Woo [31] investigated the application of a 4-week forest-walking based CBT
program for treating clinical depression. Research findings from Kim et al. [31] demonstrated a
significant remission rate in the forest walking group at 61% over the traditional psychotherapy
hospital-based group at 21%. Kim et al. [31] explicitly cited the work of Australian bush adventure
therapy researchers Pryor, Carpenter and Townsend [52] in their pioneering work regarding the
connection between time spent in nature and an increase in participants’ health, well-being and
emotional confidence. Kim et al. [31] employed a robust research design in so much as researchers
incorporated the comparisons of a forest-walking based CBT program (N = 23), a hospital based
treatment group (N = 19) and an outpatient control (N = 21). Yet, as with the Pryor et al. [52] research,
inherent to the research aim of investigating the previous successes of nature-based therapy [31] is an
implicit bias toward the functionality and reliable successes of the research outcomes.
Given SY practices are relatively innocuous when compared with other more invasive procedures,
Chun, Chang and Lee [2] studied FT for patients (N = 59) diagnosed with depression and anxiety
(roughly 60–80% of the participants), as well as oxidative stress (roughly 30–50% the participants) that
is associated with stroke susceptibility and a positive stroke history. The results of this study, indicated
the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D17) and Spielberger
State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) indicate scores were lowered in the post FT intervention group
when compared with the control group scores. These results led researchers to recommend FT as a
medically viable intervention for the psychological distress associated with chronic illness [2]. Since
its’ inception in the 1970s, the STAI has been a hallmark test used to differentiate between participants’
state and trait anxiety, however, its’ brevity and pre-supposed delineation between anxiety-oriented
temperaments inspires cause for concern over its’ reliability [53].
Han et al. [3] and Kang et al. [50] focused on chronic widespread pain (CWP) and localized pain in
relation to the emotional distresses of coping with the side-effects of intractable pain. In Han et al. [3]
psychological indices were measured pre- and post- FT intervention with the BDI and the Visual
Analog Scale (VAS) to measure intensity and frequency of CWP. The results revealed statistically
significant decreases in pain and associated psychological distress as per the psychometric scales.
Whereas, Kang et al. [50] utilized the VAS and the neck disability index (NDI) for chronic neck pain
and the McGill pain questionnaire (MPQ) for localized pain, among other measures for physiological
indices. Kang et al. [50] measured incidents of painful trigger points in the posterior neck region (TRPs)
in the FB with exercise group compared with the FB without exercise, which resulted in reduction by
nearly 1
2 of TRPs in the FB plus exercise group. Widely utilized as a metric for measuring pain, Kang
et al. [50] noted the test’s functional role in objectively evaluating participants’ subjective experiences
of pain. Researchers noted the popularity of the VAS [51], but further investigation was warranted
to determine its’ reliability and validity. The VAS does have a reported test-retest reliability among
patients experiencing chronic pain (r = 0.94; p < 0.001) in a previous investigation [51], yet, given the
subjective nature of pain and uncertain unanimous consensus on pain metrics in international medical
literature, this study demonstrated a lack of criterion validity for the VAS.
With regards to human spirituality, Nakau et al. [33] noted in their pilot study involving 22 breast
or lung cancer patients, consisting of 4 males (with an average age of 65.3 ± 2.6 years) and 18 females
(with an average age of 56.6 ± 11.3 years), that FT can be viewed as an enhancement of spiritual health
in cancer patients. Patients in this study [33] were all participating one month or more after undergoing
surgery, chemotherapy, or radiation treatment. While patients were not considered to be at risk of
life-threatening conditions at the time of study [33], the stress of undergoing treatment for chronic
disease was implicated. All patients (N = 22), participated in the integrated FT, horticultural therapy,
yoga exercise, meditation and group therapy treatment intervention at the Japan World Exposition
(1970) Park in Suita, Osaka prefecture, Japan [33]. The results of this study indicated statistically
significant correlations pre- and post-intervention between green environments and individuals’
experiences of self-realization, increased emotional health and integrative well-being, as measured by
the Japanese version of the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Spiritual Well-Being

Scale (FACIT-Sp), QoL questionnaire, Cancer Fatigue Scale, POMS and STAI, in addition to physiologic
measures of NK activity [33].
3.5. Autonomic Nervous System Effects
Research on the cardiovascular effects of SY have precipitated a trend to discover how FB affects
the ANS. At the level of the central nervous system (CNS) alone, marked changes in cerebral activity
have been identified. Joung et al. [28] designed novel research to investigate identified specific
anatomical cortices within the brain that vary in stimulation to both forest and urban areas. Activity
in the prefrontal cortices of the forest-area group participants were significantly lower than that of
the city-area group participants in the “after walking” through their randomly assigned locations.
This decrease in activity suggests a strong correlation between nature settings and ANS activity [28].
Research has shown peak HF levels can be seen within 5–7 min of each nature experience, which
demonstrates not only will SY benefit the health of the ANS, but that positive HF components of HRV
are evident within minutes of forest immersion [9]. Regarding other physiologic indicators of stress,
Mao et al. [24] conducted a quantitative RCT that demonstrated after short periods of time in nature,
measures of malondialdehyde (MDA) concentrations, cytokine production, serum cortisol, testosterone,
and lymphocytes decreased. Universal findings revealed LF components were significantly lower in
the forest areas than in the city areas, while HF components of HRV tended to be higher in the forest
than in the city and therefore these research findings are important for further physiological research
and the effects of SY [17,18,20,23–25,27,52].
3.6. Endocrine Function
This section, a further investigation into the physiological and psychological effects of SY or
NT via the physiological metrics relevant to endocrine included 11 publications. These resources
specifically measured the effects of SY or NT on specific physiological and psychological indicators
of stress via measures of salivary cortisol (sCort), and/or emotional indicators of health and
well-being [1,17,24–27,34,36,40,47–49,52,53]. Kobayashi and Miyazaki [53] studied baseline cortisol
measures in 267 healthy male students from The University of Chiba, Japan, with the aim to compare
measures in future SY studies. In Largo-Wright et al. [48] researchers deduced a correlation between
increased contact with nature and decreased stress levels and generalized health complaints in office
workers at a Southeastern university in the U.S. via the Nature Contact Questionnaire (NCQ), The
Perceived Stress Questionnaire (PSQ), and a health behavior assessment derived from contact with the
outdoors, over other types of contact with nature, such as indoor plants [48]. Additionally, practices of
SY have demonstrated statistical significance in lowering blood-glucose. In a 2012 longitudinal trial,
researchers from Hokkaido University, Japan, demonstrated forest-walking reduced blood glucose
levels in 48 Type 2 diabetic patients [34]. A total of 48 participants, 16 males and 32 females, with a
mean age of 66.8 years and diagnosed with DMII, walked for distances of 3 to 6 km nine times per
week over a period of 6 years. There was no statistically significant difference between the subjects’
glucose levels, or HbA1c levels between the shorter and longer walks. However, averages of both
groups’ blood glucose levels pre and post-forest walks declined by 79 ± 10 mg/dL and 76 ± 7 mg/dL
respectively [34].
In the pilot study with a cross-over experimental design, investigators [52] addressed the impact
of participants (N = 15) exposure to four urban and natural environments on physiological and
psychological stress matrices. The study [52] utilized sCort and salivary amylase (sAA) as metrics,
which the authors note via the work of Engert et al. [54] have been significantly reliable physiological
biomarkers for stress. Additionally, Beil and Hanes [52] obtained data from questionnaires measuring
participants’ experience of stress via the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), Perceived Restorativeness Scale
(PRS), Subjective Stress Scale (SSS) and susceptibility of affective connections to natural environments
via the Environmental Identity Scale (EID), pre- and post-intervention, which included a 20-min
exposure to 4 different environments ranging from the “mostly built” to the “mostly natural.” The
 Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2017, 14, 851
40 of 48
participants’ sAA and sCort levels respectively peaked after exposure to the urban environments, while
levels were within normal range post exposure to the natural environments, which also correlated
with participants’ subjective impressions of stress [52]. The EID, while relatively novel, was noted to
have been previously tested for its’ effectiveness in ascertaining subjects’ general health and welfare
status in response to the environment [52].
3.7. Sensory Metrics (SM)
Fisher [55] illuminated an emerging interest in FT practices for psychological and physiological
healing. By interviewing a proponent of FT, Fisher described the growing trend of individuals restoring
native tree habitats with the dual purpose of environmental stewardship and psychological welfare
of the persons involved in the process; paralleling the sentiments of many SY researchers [9] and
supporting the Biophilia hypothesis [8]. Furthermore, Stigsdotter [36] conducted a case-study that
followed up on survey driven data collected from a 2005 Danish Health Interview of 10,125 adult
males and females and, results revealed significant positive correlations between access to green-space
within 1 km, self-perceptions of stress and general health and well-being.
A subset of publications explicitly focused on sensorial stimuli, as a function of the effects of
SY, which included time spent in forested outdoor environments, interactions with elemental aspects
of natural environments and laboratory settings. Tsunetsugu et al. [13] synthesized evidence from
physiological and psychological indices into subcategories, which exemplified the biomechanics of
SY impact on the five senses. Eight key publications specific to SM were incorporated within this
review, including: the metrics of olfaction [14,16], tactile stimulation [19], and visual stimulation, or
neurological response [11,15,28,56,57].
Research included within the SM theme invariably measured nervous system activity and
emotional response of participants in relation to experiencing authentic aspects of forested
environments by comparative means. Igarashi et al. [56] studied participants’ HRV, as an indicator
of PNS activity in 48 high-school students viewing real vs. artificial pansies, the results of which
illustrated a stronger correlation between relaxation with the real pansies versus the silk flowers.
This was represented by a significant decrease in the ratio of LF/HF HRV, and subjective analysis
of students’ self-perception of relaxation indicating preference towards real flowers. Furthermore,
Igarashi et al. [11] analyzed right and left prefrontal cortical activity in terms of cerebral blood-flow, and
hemoglobin concentration changes via Near Infrared Time Resolved Spectroscopy (NIRS), which was
measured in units of micro-meters (µM), according to the wavelengths observed. This was performed
before and after participants were subjected to four visual conditions (real dracaena plants, images of
dracaena plants, cardboard boxes and images of cardboard boxes) for timed intervals of 0–3 min each.
Notably, µM concentrations were higher in participants viewing the actual dracaena plant stimulus
for 3 min versus the pictorial sample for the same amount of time in right and left prefrontal cortical
areas respectively [11]. Joung et al. [28] also utilized NIRS to determine µM levels pre-posttest
upon participants viewing actual forested versus urban areas.
Counter to the aforementioned
Igarashi et al. [11] study, participants demonstrated increased subjective measurements of relaxation
correlated with decreased µM concentrations and prefrontal cortical activity, and increased feelings
of calmness from the forested site vs. urban site [28]. This may indicate not only are aspects of the
natural environment optically stimulating as illustrated by Igarashi et al. [11] but they may also require
less executive functioning as demonstrated by Joung et al. [28]. Mutual feelings of “calmness” were
derived from each study.
Igarashi et al. [15] looked at comparisons between participants viewing images of kiwifruit
orchards and specific urban areas in Japan. The POMS and HRV were used to evaluate participants’
responses, which demonstrated moderate increases in PNS activity and feelings of “relaxation and
calmness” when viewing the orchard versus an urban setting. Subjective measures of stress reduction
have been consistently apparent in the studies focused on visual stimulation regardless of physiological
indices. In Tsutsumi et al. [57], researchers aimed to investigate and compare participants’ relaxation
 Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2017, 14, 851
41 of 48
states before and after viewing visual footage of forested landscapes, and comparatively, seascapes.
Measures of HRV, results from POMS questionnaires, and Bispectral Index System analysis (measured
brain activity via electrode placement) allowed researchers to determine participants’ sleep-wake
states while comparing brain wave activity. Findings indicated significant decreases in HR, greater
relaxation in post-intervention analysis in both groups, with the forest-viewing group demonstrating
the greatest difference in relaxation-states across all measures [57]. These studies give statistically
significant credence to the notion visual stimulation by aspects of forested environments reduces stress
and increases a general sense of well-being in various study populations. Furthermore, these studies
serve as templates to be integrated into therapeutic practices as suggested by Tsutsumi, et al. [57].
Koga and Iwasaki [19] investigated the potential for foliage-based tactile stimuli to induce relaxing
effects that have been demonstrated via SY based field experiments. These researchers [19] utilized
NIRS to detect cerebral blood-flow and the Semantic Differential (SD) model to determine emotional
responses in participants’ experiences with touching leaves versus other non-natural substances,
such as plates of metal and fabrics. As noted by Park et al. [58], laboratory-based research on the
physiological and psychological effects of SY has been paramount. Furthermore, the Koga and
Iwasaki [19] study revealed statistically significant correlations between touching natural substances,
such as tree-bark, and incidents of decreased blood pressure. Moreover, these findings are associated
with an increase in participants’ subjective feelings of calmness. However, despite the clarity in
exposition, researchers didn’t identify the reliability and validity of the SD method utilized in the
study. As with several SY studies, specific to psychological indices, self-reported measures in the form
of questionnaires, such as the SD method, provided a bulk of the data. Therefore, leaving a question
about the consistency, validity and reliability of the reported psychological outcomes.
Previous research regarding the effects of SY explored elements of olfaction as a sense metric
relevant to the biological effects of experiencing forested environments. Tsunetsugu et al. [13] noted
in their review, phytoncides, or volatile organic chemical compounds released from plants and trees
have previously been associated with the effects of SY. Furthermore, Li et al. [63] described how the
scent derived from phytoncides of 13 different tree species (phytoncides are unique to each specie and
serve as a critical communication pathway between trees classified under the same genus) increased
human Natural Killer Cell activity and decreased adrenaline in the FT intervention group of the study
comparing urban and forested environments on human immune and stress function. Ikei et al. [16]
studied the impact of α-pinene, a phytoncide from Japanese cedar wood (which is notably ubiquitous
in forested areas of Japan) on ANS function via HRV indexes and the SD method. The results of which
indicated an increase in PNS activity and a decrease in heart rate [16].
Jo et al. [14] focused research efforts on “floral scent”, specifically Japanese plum blossoms,
utilizing NIRS, HRV, POMS, and the SD as the physiological and psychological indices. Researchers
created a unique apparatus for metering the floral and control scents, which involved a polypropylene
pressurized bag with a constant flow of controlled air to be inhaled by participants. This novel approach
controlled for many potential confounding factors given the ubiquity of various scents in laboratory
settings. Utilizing multichannel NIRS enabled researchers to investigate the effects of olfactory
stimulation on 47 localized neurological regions corresponding to areas noted for emotional, judgement,
motor control, memory, somatosensory, cognitive, visual, auditory, and speech functions [14]. The
literature expounding upon sense-metrics pertaining to the effects of SY illuminates a thorough pursuit
of specificity and ingenuity.
Following a systematic review of 25 articles from databases including, but not limited to PubMed,
EMBASE, CINAHL, and PsychINFO, Bowler [1] found each study suggested natural environments
may have direct and positive impacts on humans’ overall well-being. Bowler recognizes it is difficult to
truly separate the raw effects of experiencing nature from confounding factors, such as physical activity
performed, previous exposure to nature, as well as an optimal time frame for these effects. However,
Bowler and every author mentioned throughout this literature review stress the aim to encourage
research on the health benefits associated with the practice of SY. While research in primarily Japan
 Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2017, 14, 851
42 of 48
and China has shown a positive impact of SY on both the physiological and psychological structures
throughout the human body, it also calls for Western cultures to incorporate elements of the SY practice,
so as to demonstrate compatible results world-wide for both patients and their healthcare providers [1].
3.8. Conceptual Frameworks
3.8.1. Nature Therapy
During the review of the literature, existing conceptual frameworks emerged that may be applied
to SY practice and NT research. The first conceptual framework (CF) is Thomson’s “vis medicatrix
naturae,” otherwise known as, “the innate ability of the body to heal itself” as presented in Logan and
Selhub’s review of the effects nature has on the human brain [59]. Thomson posits the healing power
associated with nature is directly connected with an individual’s intentional contact with “animate
and inanimate” aspects of the outdoors, such as touching the bark of a tree. While recognizing today’s
citizens’ increased use of technology, exposure to air pollution and the associated increased stress
responses, Logan and Selhub [60] present questions based on Thomson’s framework. For example,
“What might be an appropriate “dose” (duration and frequency) of nature contact to reduce stress?”
“Are certain types of activities (e.g., gardening, walking in forest settings, contemplating in an urban
park) more effective than others?” [60] Future directions for research, global urban planning and
architecture, and policy making may be based on Thomson’s framework of “vis medicatrix naturae.”
Furthermore, the research conducted by Selhub and Logan directly points to the health benefits
associated with natural environments and may be parallel to the practice of SY and NT.
3.8.2. Psychological Underpinnings
The second CF is by Berger [61]. Berger presents a novel, autonomous and independent NT
framework that serves as a model to support art and drama therapy. Within this theoretical and
applied framework, which is considered “integrative” because it takes place in nature and serves as a
part of the human healing process is the self- “reflexive” process that includes personal experiences.
The NT model and theory are supported by past evidence derived from Gestalt psychology and the
narrative research approach mixed with traditional “ritual” foundations. This novel theory attempts to
put a spotlight on modern individuals’ detachment from nature, absence from community engagement
and spirituality through a psycho-eco-social lens. Berger purports individual’s personal estrangement
from nature, lack of involvement in community affairs and spirituality as being main factors influencing
the modern-day spread of loneliness, depression, anxiety, low self-esteem and detachment. SY practice
and NT research may be grounded in Berger’s CF that recognizes the healing natural forces, resilience
and recovery associated with nature.
The third CF is from a Threshold Concept and Transformational Learning perspective [62]. The
practice of SY assisted by trained nature and forest therapy guides leads individuals into a “liminal”
space. In this “liminal” space, also known as an “in-between” human state or “suspended state of
partial knowing,” the healing properties associated with SY are purportedly activated [62]. During
the “liminal” phase, a person integrates, discards and experiences an “ontological shift” and then
experiences “transformation” and a “changed discourse,” known as a “post-liminal phase.” The
individual may experience a “pre-liminal” space in nature and may vacillate between old and emergent
thoughts that may be disruptive. However, once in the “liminal” psychological space, the individual
experiences a sense of calm and mastery. The immersion into nature may lead to a transformative
way of knowing and understanding the self. These noteworthy concepts may serve as foundations for
future research studies.
3.9. Limitations
Limitations of this review include the biases among the authors of the studies and articles culled,
as well as the conceivable restrictions of SY as an evidence based practice within the traditional
 Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2017, 14, 851
43 of 48
principles of Western medicine. While search criteria for the articles remained consistent across all
database searches, publication bias must be acknowledged as most of the studies reviewed demonstrate
a positive correlation among SY practice and NT with favorable physiological and psychological
outcomes. In addition, original study sample sizes were often limited to less than 20 participants, with
the inclusion criteria of primarily of healthy, young, male university students, making results difficult
to generalize across entire populations. Other limitations within the studies include their inability to
distinguish physical and psychological effects purely based on the participants’ surroundings versus
the participants’ level of activity while present in either an urban or nature setting. Most studies offer
little distinction among senses used, and which, if any, have a greater influence on positive or negative
outcomes. While the current research has continued to trend toward the benefits of SY and NT on
specific disease states and diagnoses, it has primarily focused on the short-term effects of the practice
of SY and NT with little research to indicate the longevity of its benefits. This concept of permanence
relates not only to the amount of time spent in a nature setting for short-term optimal results within a
study timeframe, but the participants’ previous relationship with nature throughout their lifetime, and
how a priming bias may influence the amplitude and frequency of corporeal effects. SY as a therapeutic
practice to be exemplified by healthcare providers and recommended to their patients includes the
limitations of theoretically defining SY for clinical use, the social and economic determinants of health
which limit access to natural environments, and the correlation between the ever changing diversity of
nature itself and the unpredictable physiological and psychological responses it may induce within the
human body as noted by the Biophilia Hypothesis [8].
4. Discussion
4.1. Overview of Health Benefits of SY and NT
In general, from a physiological perspective, significant empirical research findings point to
a reduction in human heart rate and blood pressure and an increase in relaxation for participants
exposed to natural GS [13,40]. Even research involving the use of nature videos of the forest or the
ocean have the same physiological effects [60]. From a qualitative and psychological perspective,
Danish participants reported a sense of safety, calm and overall general wellbeing following exposure
or engagement with nature [63]. South Korean participants with a known alcohol addiction and high
pre-test scores of depression benefited more from the Forest Therapy Camp than participants with
lower pre-test scores of depression and alcohol abuse [35]. Differences in culture, gender, education,
marital or economic status were not associated confounding factors in many of the empirical studies.
Overall, our review of the literature, as illustrated in Table 1, points to positive health benefits associated
with SY and NT while confounding factors were clearly identified by the researchers.
4.2. Implications for Future Research
The aims of this state-of-the-art review are to showcase and elucidate the existing research
on the effects of the practice of SY and NT on human physiological and psychological systems,
existing frameworks and sense metrics in order to assist researchers in conducting future empirical
research to substantiate, gain a better insight and enrich the scholarly literature.
Longitudinal
research is recommended to investigate the powers of nature as a healer and preventative element
in today’s modern/technological driven world over a long period of time. Proposed thoughtful and
well-designed research would include both quantitative and qualitative approaches to identify specific
SY and NT factors that influence disease and health promotion in Western Cultures. Furthermore, a
systematic review of the current literature would honor the scholarly work completed to date and
provide a higher level of evidence for the practitioner considering SY and NT as EBP interventions.

4.3. Implications for Future Healthcare Practice
This in-depth review illustrates, honors and supports the increased awareness of the positive
health-related effects (e.g., stress reduction and increased holistic well-being) associated with humans
spending time in nature, viewing nature scenes via video, being exposed to foliage and flowers indoors
and the development of urban green spaces in large metropolitan areas worldwide. Not only valid and
reliable psychometrics have been implemented, but valid and reliable physiological measurements
have been used to show significant and potentially healing and health promoting effects. Furthermore,
physiological and psychological research, based on sound NT frameworks and hypotheses is needed
in the areas of healthcare professional/student stress-reduction and life balance [64,65].
Healthcare professionals and educators may turn to the SY and NT literature for simple, affordable
and enjoyable complementary interventions to reduce stress, anxiety, and depression symptoms and
enhance joy, relaxation, overall sense of well-being and balance in life. The founder and faculty member
of the Association of Nature and Forest Therapy Guides and Programs, Amos Clifford, states the
organization’s mission is to integrate FT into healthcare systems [62]. Moreover, the profession of
nursing and medicine has moved toward an integrative approach to healthcare. The third integrative
nursing principle: “Nature has healing and restorative properties that contribute to health and
well-being” supports the health benefits associated with the practice of SY and NT and serves as
a part of the integrated healthcare model [66]. Furthermore, SY as a healing and restorative modality
may support the clinician’s and patient’s whole-being while promoting a sense of peace, dignity
and comfort. These ideas are supported by Watson’s Carative Processes [67], specifically Process
Eight: Creating healing environment at all levels, whereby wholeness, beauty, comfort, dignity, and peace are
potentiated.
5. Conclusions
Advancements in complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) are indicative of a time in
history when researchers and practitioners are willing to look at how humans evolved over the past
6- to 7-million years. When one ponders humans existing less than 0.01% of the species’ history in
modern surroundings and the other 99.99% of the time living in nature, it is no wonder some humans
yearn and are drawn back to where human physiological/psychological functions began and were
naturally supported. The Biophilia Hypothesis [8] supports SY and NT because it is steeped in the idea
humans have an inner biological attraction to nature and its importance in our human development.
Moreover, psychologically and spiritually speaking, humans intuitively know the relaxing, soothing
and “awe” effects of being in or viewing forests, plants, flowers, urban green spaces, parks and natural
wooden materials [68,69]. The mind-body-spirit experience associated with SY is for all humans and
may be accomplished in various documented ways as illustrated in the novel review. These methods
are supported by current scientific data, history and personal experiences reported over time. The
practice of SY and NT are ontological realism and offer humans an authentic way of healing and
health prevention for the mind, body and spirit [70–72]. How might we continue to encourage this
health-promotion method and demonstrate scientifically and intuitively in order to add to EBP and
global healthcare systems?
