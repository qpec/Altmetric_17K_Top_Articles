SUMMARY
Rhinovirus is a leading cause of acute respiratory in-
fections and asthma attacks, but infections are also
frequently cleared from the nasal mucosa without
causing symptoms. We sought to better understand
host defense against rhinovirus by investigating anti-
viral defense in primary human nasal and bronchial
airway epithelial cells cultured ex vivo. Surprisingly,
upon
rhinovirus
infection
or
RIG-I
stimulation,
nasal-derived epithelial cells exhibited much more
robust antiviral responses than bronchial-derived
cells. Conversely, RIG-I stimulation triggered more
robust activation of the NRF2-dependent oxidative
stress response in bronchial cells compared to nasal
cells. NRF2 activation dampened epithelial antiviral
responses, whereas NRF2 knockdown enhanced
antiviral
responses
and
was
protective
during
rhinovirus infection. These findings demonstrate
a tradeoff in epithelial defense against distinct
types of airway damage, namely, viral versus oxida-
tive, and reveal differential calibration of defense
responses in cells derived from different airway
microenvironments.
INTRODUCTION
Respiratory virus infections cause an estimated 500 million colds
per year in the US and contribute to the roughly 2 million annual
hospitalizations for respiratory illness (Fendrick et al., 2003;
NIAID, 2001; Pfunter et al., 2013) However, recent evidence sug-
gests that presence of respiratory viruses in the nasal passages
is even more common but that viruses are often cleared without
causing symptoms (Bosch et al., 2013; Jartti et al., 2008). For
example, in a recent family surveillance study, respiratory viruses
were detected on average 7.3 weeks per year per person, but
almost half of infections were asymptomatic (44%; Byington
et al., 2015). These data suggest that, in many cases, airway de-
fense responses enable efficient local viral clearance without
engaging defenses that lead to symptoms, such as excessive
inflammation and mucus production. To better understand the
molecular basis of antiviral defense responses in the airway,
we have focused on interactions between epithelial cells and
rhinovirus (RV), the most frequent cause of colds, asthma at-
tacks, and exacerbations of chronic airway disease (Gern, 2010).
Multiple lines of evidence indicate that innate defenses of
airway epithelial cells can efficiently block RV replication and
clear infection at its earliest stages. Airway epithelial cells are
the target cells within which RV replicates, but RV replication
within these cells can trigger powerful innate defense responses,
including induction of type I and type III interferons (IFNs) and
interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), programmed cell death,
and RNaseL activity, all of which can block RV replication (Fox-
man et al., 2015, 2016; Slater et al., 2010; Wang et al., 2009).
Furthermore, epithelial cell interferon responses triggered by
RNA virus infection are attenuated in several patient groups sus-
ceptible to severe RV illness, including asthmatics and smokers,
further supporting the idea that epithelial cell defenses are criti-
cally important for optimal control of RV infection (Contoli
et al., 2006; Jaspers et al., 2010; Wu et al., 2016; Wark et al.,
2005).
RV first enters the respiratory tract in the nasal passages, but
cells and cell lines of bronchial origin are by far more commonly
used as experimental tools. Here, we sought to compare antiviral
responses of primary epithelial cells cultured from the nasal or
bronchial airway mucosa of healthy donors. We were particularly
interested in examining nasal epithelial cells because previous
work showed that incubating primary airway cells at cool tem-
perature, mimicking the conditions of the nasal passages,
dampens antiviral responses triggered by cytoplasmic RNA
(Foxman et al., 2015, 2016). This finding suggests that nasal
and bronchial epithelial cells might require different calibration
of innate responses to maintain effective antiviral defense in
distinct in vivo anatomical microenvironments.
Here, we report fundamental differences in the responses of
nasal and bronchial primary human epithelial cells to rhinovirus

 infection or direct stimulation of the viral RNA sensor RIG-I. We
studied primary nasal- or bronchial-derived airway epithelial
cells using a culture system that models basal cells, the regional
progenitor cells of the airway epithelium central to epithelial
defense and repair following mucosal injury (Rock et al., 2010).
In cells derived from both sites, RIG-I stimulation triggered acti-
vation of well-characterized signaling pathways, mediating pro-
tective responses against both viral infection and intracellular
oxidative stress. Interestingly, however, nasal cells showed a
more predominant interferon response, whereas bronchial cells
exhibited a more predominant oxidative stress response. Further
investigation revealed evidence for antagonism between activity
of the NRF2-mediated oxidative stress response and RIG-I-
dependent interferon and ISG defense in epithelial cells and a
surprising cytoprotective effect of NRF2 knockdown during RV
infection due to decreased viral replication. Based on these find-
ings, we propose a model in which epithelial cell-intrinsic
defense mechanisms are tailored for different airway microenvi-
ronments to optimize airway protection.
RESULTS
Antiviral Responses of Primary Airway Epithelial Cells
Track with Site of Origin in the Respiratory Tract
Previous work showed that incubating primary airway epithelial
cells at cool temperature (33�C), mimicking the conditions of
the nasal passages, diminished antiviral responses triggered
by cytoplasmic RNA, including induction of type I and type III in-
terferons (Foxman et al., 2015, 2016). These findings suggest
that nasal epithelial cells may require adaptations to maintain
robust antiviral defense within their naturally cooler local micro-
environment in vivo. To examine this hypothesis, we obtained
primary nasal or bronchial epithelial cells from healthy donors
(commercially; see STAR Methods), cultured them on collagen
under conditions that promote a basal cell phenotype, and
then infected with rhinovirus 1B (RV1B). All experiments were
performed at low passage number (P3 or fewer). Compared to
bronchial epithelial cells, nasal-derived epithelial cells displayed
much more robust secretion of the type III interferon, IFNl1,
following rhinovirus infection at 37�C, at a time point when viral
load was equivalent in both cell types (Figures 1A and S1).
Consistent with previous studies, when cells were incubated at
33�C, IFNl1 secretion was greatly reduced (Figure S1). Interest-
ingly, the low but detectable level of IFNl1 secreted by nasal
cells at nasal temperature (33�C) was comparable to levels
observed in bronchial epithelial cells at lung temperature
(37�C; Figure S1). Because the levels of virus replication may
contribute to the difference in IFNl1 levels between the two
cell types, we next performed experiments using a non-repli-
cating RIG-I ligand, stem loop RNA (SLR), SLR14, and a short
50-triphosphorylated RNA ligand of the cytoplasmic innate im-
mune sensor RIG-I (Linehan et al., 2018). Following transfection
of cells with SLR14, we observed more robust IFNl1 secretion
and induction of mRNA for IFNl1, IFNb, and the interferon-stim-
ulated gene OAS1 in nasal cells compared to bronchial cells
when both cell types were incubated at the same temperature
(Figures 1B–1H).
To assess whether differences in nasal and bronchial cell
responses to RIG-I ligand were due to differences in transfec-
tion efficiency, we created a modified SLR14 labeled with Alexa
488 (SLR14-488). Flow cytometric analysis of nasal and
bronchial cells following transfection with SLR14-488 revealed
an increase in fluorescence to an equivalent degree for
both cell types, indicating equivalent transfection efficiency
(Figures S1C and S1D). Consistent with results seen with
unlabeled SLR14 (Figure 1), SLR14-488 stimulated greater
induction of mRNAs encoding IFNl1 and the interferon stimu-
lated gene IFIT2 in nasal cells compared to bronchial cells
(Figures S1E and S1F). These findings indicate that differences
between nasal and bronchial-derived cells in interferon and

RIG-I Stimulation Triggers Differential Activation of the
Antiviral Interferon Response and the NRF2-Dependent
Oxidative Stress Response in Nasal and Bronchial Cells
To better understand the differences in the response to RIG-I
stimulation in epithelial cells cultured from nasal or bronchial
sites, we performed RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) to compare
the transcriptomes of resting and SLR14-stimulated cells. First,
we examined resting gene expression in both cell types (Fig-
ure S2). We observed many commonalities and some differ-
ences in resting gene expression (Figure S2A). Both nasal and
bronchial cells expressed lineage markers of airway basal cells,
the self-renewing regional progenitor cells of the airway epithe-
lium (Figure S2B). This finding is consistent with previous studies
showing that the epithelial cells that proliferate from primary
airway mucosa in conventional culture have a basal cell pheno-
type, with expression of basal cell lineage markers KRT5 and
TP63 (Hackett et al., 2011; Rock et al., 2010). Examination of
transcripts for RIG-I and other signaling molecules involved in
innate immune recognition of RNA viruses revealed a trend to-
ward equal or slightly higher expression levels in bronchial cells
at rest compared to nasal cells (Figures S2C and S2D), therefore
did not provide an explanation for the phenotype shown in
Figure 1. Ingenuity pathway analysis revealed some small differ-
ences in pathway activation at rest but did not reveal a clear-cut
reason for the greater interferon response in nasal cells following
response to RIG-I stimulation (Figure S2E).
To assess whether the low-passage primary cells used in this
study retained characteristics specific to the site of origin, we
examined region-specific mRNA biomarkers. Previous work
showed that regional progenitor cells derived from different
airway regions retain gene expression patterns reflecting the
site of origin within the respiratory tract, and furthermore that
progenitor cells can proliferate and differentiate to form a differ-
entiated airway epithelium with characteristics of the site of
origin when reintroduced into a 3D matrix (Kumar et al., 2011).
Using published microarray data (GSE32606), we identified the
top 10 differentially expressed genes in nasal versus tracheal-
derived airway progenitor cells and examined expression of
these transcripts in cells used in this study. The differential
expression pattern in our RNA-seq data comparing nasal and
bronchial-derived cells largely mirrored the pattern seen previ-
ously in nasal versus tracheal-derived regional progenitor cells
(Figures S2F and S2G). Next, we performed qRT-PCR on nasal
and bronchial cells from different donors used in this study and
found enrichment of the nasal-associated biomarker FOXG1 in
nasal cells from different donors and higher expression of the
tracheal and bronchial-enriched mRNA SERPINF1 in bronchial
cells from different donors (Figure S2H). These results indicate
that nasal and bronchial-derived cells cultured under the condi-
tions used in this study retain gene expression patterns reflective
of the site of origin within the respiratory tract.
Next, we compared the transcriptional changes observed in
nasal or bronchial cells following stimulation with the RIG-I ligand
SLR14 (Figure 2). Consistent with the known role of RIG-I like
receptors (RLRs), stimulation with SLR14 led to enrichment in
transcripts associated with the antiviral response, including
‘‘interferon signaling,’’ ‘‘activation of IRF by cytosolic PRRs,’’
and ‘‘role of PRR in recognition of bacteria and viruses’’ (Figures
2A and 2B). Interestingly, the other top pathway enriched by
RIG-I stimulation was the NRF2-mediated oxidative stress
response (Figures 2A and 2B). NRF2 is a transcription factor
that is activated by oxidative stress in the cytosol, leading to tran-
scription of diverse targets involved in neutralizing reactive
oxygen species and restoring homeostasis (Suzuki and Yama-
moto, 2015). Notably, transcripts related to interferon signaling

 dominated the response to SLR14 in nasal cells, whereas tran-
scripts related to the NRF2 pathway were more significantly en-
riched in bronchial cells (Figures 2B–2D). As shown on radar plots
representing mean fragments per kilobase mapped (FPKM),
overall mRNA levels of canonical ISGs were strongly induced
and more highly expressed in nasal cells compared to bronchial
cells (Figure 2C), whereas transcripts encoding antioxidant en-
zymes, a subset of NRF2 targets, were more highly expressed
in bronchial cells compared to nasal cells following RIG-I stimu-
lation (Figure 2D). A more complete list of enriched pathways and
associated transcripts is shown in Table S1. The effects of SLR14
treatment were not predictable from the resting transcriptomes,
which showed a slight enrichment for both pathways in bronchial
cells at rest compared to resting nasal cells (Figure S2E).
NRF2-Mediated Oxidative Stress Response Antagonizes
Epithelial Antiviral Defense and Promotes Rhinovirus
Replication
Previous studies have reported that NRF2 activation during viral
infection in macrophages and dendritic cells is associated with
decreased inflammatory and antiviral responses (Ahmed et al.,
2017; Olagnier et al., 2014; Yageta et al., 2011). This work, com-
bined with the observed relatively lower antiviral response and
greater NRF2-mediated response in bronchial cells compared
to nasal cells (Figure 2), suggested that NRF2 activation in airway
epithelial cells might be antagonizing activation of RIG-I-depen-
dent antiviral responses. To test this hypothesis, we asked
whether NRF2 knockdown in bronchial epithelial cells increased
RIG-I-dependent interferon and ISG induction. NRF2 knock-
down enhanced induction of mRNA encoding IFNl1 and the
ISG IFIT2 following SLR14 exposure (Figures 3A–3C). As ex-
pected, knockdown of mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein
(MAVS), an essential signaling adaptor downstream of RIG-I,
abrogated SLR14-dependent antiviral responses (Figures 3A–
3C). Next, we tested the effect of NRF2 activation on the robust
SLR14-triggered interferon and ISG responses observed in nasal
epithelial cells. To do this, we pretreated cells overnight with the
well-characterized NRF2 activator sulforaphane prior to RIG-I
stimulation and then stimulated cells with SLR14 and assessed
gene expression after 5 hr. Sulforaphane (SULF) pretreatment
significantly reduced interferon and ISG induction upon subse-
quent stimulation with SLR14 (Figures 3D and 3E). Sulforaphane
pretreatment led to sustained NRF2 activation, as indicated by
induction of an NRF2-regulated gene, glutamate-cysteine ligase
catalytic subunit (GCLC), whereas SLR14 did not induce GCLC
mRNA under these conditions (Figure 3F). These results indicate
that NRF2 activity antagonizes interferon induction in both types
of airway cells.
NRF2 Knockdown within Host Cells Decreases
Rhinovirus Replication
The observations reported here indicate that, within airway
epithelial cells, NRF2 activity antagonizes RIG-I-mediated anti-
viral signaling. Previous work has shown that alteration in
signaling by RIG-I-like receptors can have profound effects on
the outcome of RV infection in host cells with robust interferon re-
sponses (Foxman et al., 2015). Therefore, we sought to probe the
effect of modulating NRF2 activity within host cells on RV replica-
tion. First, we targeted NRF2 activity using small interfering RNA
(siRNA) knockdown in nasal epithelial cells and then examined
rhinovirus amplification from a low MOI. Strikingly, at 40 hr
post-infection, viral titer was >10-fold higher in supernatants
from control cells than NRF2 knockdown cells and virus-induced
cytopathic effect was significantly more advanced in control cells
than knockdown cells (Figures 4A–4C). NRF2 knockdown cells
exhibited significantly higher expression of the ISG IFIT2 and
significantly lower levels of mRNAs encoding NRF2 and the
NRF2 target NQO1 compared to control cells (Figures 4D–4F).
These findings indicate that NRF2 knockdown cells are pro-
tected from RV replication, consistent with the observed
enhancement in ISG induction (Figure 4D).
Next, we sought to test the effect of enhancing NRF2 activity in
primary nasal epithelial cells by mimicking a physiological source

targeting NRF2 or MAVS or with control siRNA (RNA-induced silencing com-
plex [RISC]-free). After recovery for four days, cells were transfected with the
RIG-I ligand SLR14 and then incubated for 6 hr at 37�C, followed by RNA
isolation and qRT-PCR for mRNA encoding IFNl1 (A) and IFIT2 (B). Significant

(F). Graph shows untreated cells with no stimulation (Ctrl) or SLR14 exposure

 of NRF2 activation in the airway, exposure to cigarette smoke.
Airway epithelial cells from smokers show enhanced expression
of NRF2 target genes compared to non-smokers (Spira et al.,
2004), and enrichment of NRF2 targets is also observed upon
stimulation of cultured bronchial epithelial cells in vitro with ciga-
rette smoke extract (Pickett et al., 2010; Proud et al., 2012). To
test the effect of NRF2 activation in primary human nasal epithe-
lial cells on RV1B replication, we exposed cells to cigarette
smoke extract (CSE) and assessed RV amplification from a low
MOI following incubation at 33�C for 40 hr. We observed a signif-
icant effect on RV1B replication, which doubled in cells exposed
to CSE (Figure 4G). CSE exposure was toxic to NRF2 knock-
down (KD) cells (Figure S3), consistent with the known impor-
tance of NRF2-dependent responses for cell survival of oxidative
stress and cigarette smoke exposure in particular (Ma, 2013).
Therefore, although we could not directly test the role of NRF2
in CSE-dependent increase in RV replication using knockdown,
we explored the hypothesis that CSE exposure activates NRF2
and concomitantly suppresses antiviral interferon responses
by testing the effect of CSE exposure on the basal and SLR14-
induced expression of IFIT2 and NQO1 in these cells. We
observed that CSE exposure increases expression of the NRF2
target NQO1 and decreases SLR14-dependent IFIT2 expression
(Figures 4H and 4I). These findings are consistent with previous
studies showing that CSE exposure leads to a decrease in ISG
induction and a modest increase in viral replication following
RV infection of human bronchial epithelial cells (Eddleston
et al., 2011; Proud et al., 2012). Together, these findings suggest
that one mechanism whereby CSE exposure may promote RV
replication is through antagonism of the interferon response by
NRF2 activation. Overall, our findings support a model in which
tissue-specific set points and environmental factors decrease
or increase the level of NRF2 activation in RV host cells, which
in turn promotes or antagonizes the antiviral response of airway
epithelial cells (Figure S4).
DISCUSSION
Airway epithelial cells provide frontline defense against a variety
of potentially harmful substances that enter the airway from the
environment, including respiratory viruses and diverse sub-
stances that can cause oxidative damage. We found that stimu-
lation of the innate immune sensor RIG-I within airway epithelial
cells activates two central mechanisms that protect against
these sources of damage: the antiviral interferon response
(greater activation in nasal cells than in bronchial cells) and the
NRF2-mediated response to oxidative stress (greater activation
in bronchial cells compared to nasal cells). Here, we present ev-
idence that NRF2 activation antagonizes the antiviral interferon
response in the airway epithelium and evidence for cell intrinsic
regulation (i.e., innate differences between nasal and bronchial
cells) and environmental regulation (i.e., exposure to cigarette
smoke that triggers NRF2 activation) of the balance between
these two defense mechanisms in airway epithelial cells.
The antagonism we observed between NRF2 activity and
interferon and ISG induction in airway epithelial cells fits with
antagonism of immune defense by NRF2 observed in other
models. NRF2 activity was observed to suppress the interferon
response and virus-induced apoptosis in a study of Dengue virus
infection in dendritic cells (Olagnier et al., 2014), and NRF2
knockout led to exaggerated IRF3 and nuclear factor kB
(NF-kB) activation in mouse models of sepsis (Thimmulappa
et al., 2006). NRF2 activation has been shown to dampen pro-
duction of NF-kB-dependent pro-inflammatory cytokines in
diverse settings, and in fact, NRF2 activators are currently
used clinically as anti-inflammatory agents (Suzuki and Yama-
moto, 2017). Reactive oxygen species (ROS) promote cell-
intrinsic innate antiviral signaling, including RIG-I signaling
(Koarai et al., 2010; Tal et al., 2009), and neutralization of ROS
has been proposed to be the mechanism whereby NRF2 activity
suppresses antiviral and pro-inflammatory cytokine production
(Ma, 2013). Interestingly, ROS may enhance innate immune
signaling in part by effects on nucleic acid ligands. For example,
oxidation of cytosolic DNA was shown to enhance stimulator of
interferon genes (STING)-dependent innate immune signaling
due to decreased degradation of oxidized DNA by TREX1
(Gehrke et al., 2013). It will be interesting to explore how oxida-
tion of RNA ligands or other components of the RIG-I signaling
pathway might influence innate immune signaling in future
studies. In addition to effects on neutralization of ROS, an addi-
tional mechanism of NRF2-dependent suppression of innate im-
mune signaling was proposed recently, in which chromatin
immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-seq studies in lipopolysaccharide
(LPS)-stimulated macrophages showed suppression of cytokine
transcription by binding of NRF2 upstream of cytokine pro-
moters (Kobayashi et al., 2016). The mechanism(s) underlying
the antagonism between RIG-I signaling and NRF2 activation
in airway epithelial cells will be an important avenue for future
investigation. Our findings also emphasize the importance of
considering how experimental conditions impact oxidative
stress in studies of innate immune signaling.
Despite antagonism between antiviral innate immune defense
and NRF2 activity, NRF2 activation can have either protective or
deleterious effects for the host during viral infection. We
observed a cytoprotective effect of NRF2 knockdown during
rhinovirus infection in nasal epithelial cells, consistent with
enhanced ISG induction and diminished viral replication (Fig-
ure 4). However, NRF2 activity was essential for cell survival dur-
ing CSE exposure (Figure S3). Therefore, any suppressive
effects of NRF2 activation on antiviral defense represent a
necessary compromise in the presence of both CSE and viral
infection. Likewise, Olagnier et al. (2014) observed a protective
effect of NRF2 knockdown during Dengue virus infection of den-
dritic cells. In contrast, during influenza infection of cigarette-
smoke-exposed mice, NRF2 knockout diminished host survival
(Yageta et al., 2011). These results likely reflect the fact that
host resistance and clearance of infection is the best pathway
to health in some disease settings, whereas the antioxidant
response takes precedence to promote host survival in others,
particularly when multiple stressors are encountered at once.
We propose a model in which airway epithelial cells’ re-
sponses to airway injury may be differentially regulated to opti-
mize defense responses in distinct microenvironments and can
vary depending on the recent exposures of the cell. As shown
in Figure S4, in our model, virus-induced RIG-I signaling leads
to activation of both the antiviral interferon response and the
3004

 NRF2-dependent oxidative stress response. In nasal epithelial
cells, there is an inherent bias toward less NRF2 activation and
greater activation of the interferon and ISG response compared
to bronchial cells (Figure S4A). This bias may serve to enable
nasal epithelial cells to maintain robust antiviral defense in the
relatively cool temperatures of the nasal passages (Foxman
et al., 2015; Figure S1). This bias may also reflect the fact that
the nasal epithelium is also the initial site of entry for many respi-
ratory viruses and a site in which the consequences of local
epithelial damage and inflammation are relatively low. In
contrast, in the bronchi, maintaining tissue integrity and sup-
pressing inflammatory responses to keep the large airways
open is of paramount importance, fitting with the observed dif-
ference in set point favoring the NRF2 response in bronchial
epithelial cells. It is also important to note that this study models
defense responses of airway basal cells from different airway mi-
croenvironments, but in vivo, the relative proportions of differen-

(A–F) Primary human nasal epithelial cells (HNECs)
were transfected with siRNA targeting NRF2 or
RISC-free negative control siRNA and allowed to
recover for 48 hr and then infected with RV-1B,
MOI 0.05 at 33�C.
(A) Forty hours post-infection, supernatants were
collected for viral titer measurement by plaque
assay as shown.
(B and C) Micrographs show appearance of cells
treated with control siRNA (B) or siRNA targeting
NRF2 (C) at 40 hr post-infection.
(D–F) Relative expression of mRNA encoding IFIT2
(D), NQO1 (E), and NRF2 (F) in uninfected or RV1B

33�C, with or without exposure 2% CSE.
(H and I) Nasal epithelial cells were stimulated with
SLR14 and then incubated for 3 hr with medium
only or medium containing 2% or 4% CSE. RNA
was isolated and levels of mRNA encoding IFIT2
(H) and NQO1 (I) were assessed by qRT-PCR.
In all panels, bars show mean and SEM of 3–6
replicate experimental wells per condition. Graphs

tiated epithelial cell types likely also play
an important role in airway region-spe-
cific defense, such as the increased pro-
portion of mucus-producing cells in the
nasal passages compared to the bronchi
(Iwasaki et al., 2017).
In our model, in addition to inherent
region-specific adaptations of progeni-
tor cells from different airway sites, recent environmental
exposures can further influence the balance between defense
responses in the airway epithelium. For example, the NRF2
response would be expected to be activated in cells exposed
to sources of oxidative stress in the airway, which could
include environmental pollutants, such as diesel exhaust, ciga-
rette smoke, microbial metabolites, or the byproducts of
oxidative metabolism by resident cells or infiltrating leuko-
cytes. Although NRF2 activation would move cells to a new
state of adaptation that enhances cell survival during oxidative
stress, such cells would be maladapted to viral infection due to
dampening of the antiviral interferon response (Figure S4B).
We modeled this scenario in this study by exposing nasal
epithelial
cells
to
cigarette
smoke
extract,
resulting
in
increased NRF2 activity and decreased RIG-I signaling (Fig-
ures 4G–4I). Previous studies have shown diminished antiviral
responses in bronchial epithelial cells following cigarette

 smoke exposure (Eddleston et al., 2011; Proud et al., 2012);
our results indicate that a possible underlying mechanism for
this finding is antagonism between NRF2 activation and anti-
viral signaling.
Importantly, there is considerable evidence that epithelial
cells from patient groups susceptible to severe rhinovirus infec-
tion have a depressed antiviral interferon and ISG response.
Our findings suggest that activation of the NRF2-mediated
oxidative stress response in these cells could be the mecha-
nistic basis for this phenotype. There is evidence supporting
this model in one such patient group: smokers. Published
data from smokers reveal a striking transcriptional signature
of NRF2 activation (Spira et al., 2004). Chronic obstructive pul-
monary disease (COPD) and asthma patients are also highly
susceptible to serious illness following RV infection, and in
fact, RV is the top trigger of childhood asthma exacerbations
(Gern, 2010). Ex vivo experiments have shown evidence for de-
fects in cell-intrinsic innate immunity in airway epithelial cells
from asthmatics and smokers compared to healthy controls
(Contoli et al., 2006; Wu et al., 2016; Wark et al., 2005; Jaspers
et al., 2010). Our findings suggest that it will be important to
investigate whether an aberrant shift toward NRF2-mediated
antioxidant defense could underlie the observed defect in
epithelial antiviral defense, leading to increased RV susceptibil-
ity in these patients.
In summary, the findings reported here demonstrate antago-
nism between two key defense mechanisms in airway epithelial
cells and demonstrate how the activity levels of these responses
are tailored to different set points in cells derived from different
airway regions (nasal versus bronchial). We also demonstrate
that NRF2 activation by an environmental oxidative stress can
shift this balance and create vulnerability to rhinovirus infection.
These results compel further investigation of the role of NRF2
activation in RV-susceptible patient groups and indicate that
finding ways to protect the airway epithelium from intracellular
oxidative stress, and thereby avert NRF2 activation, may lead
to effective strategies to enhance natural defense against rhino-
virus infection.

EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND SUBJECT DETAILS
Primary human airway epithelial cells
Primary human nasal and bronchial cells were purchased from commercial vendors Lonza (bronchial cells, cat# CC2450S) and Pro-
mocell (nasal cells, cat# C-12620). Companies did not provide donor-specific information apart from age, gender, and healthy status,
therefore our institution did not require a protocol for human subjects research. Cells from adult donors of both genders were
included and no gender differences were noted for the phenotypes assessed in this study. For RNASeq, one donor was used for
each cell type, with 2 biological replicates per condition. Other experimental results are representative of results from multiple

 different bronchial or nasal cell donors as indicated in the figure legends. Primary human nasal and bronchial epithelial cells were
cultured on type I collagen coated tissue culture plates using BEGM growth media and supplements (Lonza, Cat# CC-3171 and
CC-4175) using Lonza protocols. Cells were used at passage 3 or lower. For SLR14 stimulation experiments and RV infection exper-
iments, hydrocortisone and epinephrine were omitted from the standard media supplements.
H1-HeLa cells
H1-HeLa cells used for generating rhinovirus stock and performing plaque assay were a generous gift from Wai-Ming Lee (Lee et al.,
2015). The following media were used for HeLa cell maintenance and RV infection as in previous studies (Foxman et al., 2015): growth
media, MEM (11095, GIBCO), 10%NCS, non-essential amino acids, penicillin-streptomycin; infection media for virus amplification:
MEM, 5% NCS, non-essential amino acids, penicillin-streptomycin, and 30mM MgCl2.
Rhinovirus 1B
RV-1B was obtained from ATCC (VR-1645) and amplified in H1-HeLa cells. To concentrate and purify virus, virus in H1-HeLa lysates
was pelleted by ultracentrifugation through a 30% sucrose cushion (SW28, 25,000 rpm, 5 hr) and virus was resuspended in PBS. Titer
was determined by plaque assay.
METHOD DETAILS
Viral infection or RIG-I stimulation of primary cells
Primary nasal and bronchial epithelial cells were grown in collagen-coated flasks and cultured identically at 37�C, then plated in
12-well or 24- well collagen-coated plates for experiments. For viral infection, subconfluent cells were inoculated with RV-1B diluted
in PBS+0.1% BSA for 1 hr at 33�C to achieve indicated multiplicity of infection (MOI). At t = 1hr, inoculum was removed, medium was
added, and plates were replaced in the 33�C incubator or shifted to 37�C. To stimulate RIG-I, a 50-triphosphorylated stem-loop RNA
containing 14 base-pairs (SLR14) was used (Linehan et al., 2018). Medium was removed and cells were stimulated with SLR14 com-
plexed with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen 1168-019) in Optimem for 1 hr, then the stimulus was removed and medium re-added
prior to incubation for the indicated time period(s). For cigarette smoke extract experiments, nasal cells were pre-incubated with me-
dium ± 2% CSE (v/v) for 6 hr prior to inoculation, then medium was removed during inoculation, and re-added prior to incubation for
40hr at 33�C. For CSE/SLR14 stimulation experiments, cells were incubated o/n with medium ± 2% or 4% CSE, then medium was
removed during SLR14 transfection, and re-added following stimulation for 3 hr incubation prior to RNA isolation and RT-qPCR.
ELISA
IFNl1 protein concentration in cell supernatants was measured using a commercial IFNl1 ELISA kit (eBiosciences cat#88-7296-22).
In brief, primary airway epithelial cells were infected with RV1B or stimulated with SLR14, then fresh medium was added to cells and
cells were incubated ay 33�C or 37�C for the indicated time points. Cell supernatants were then collected and stored at �80�C. ELISA
assay was performed on neat and diluted supernatants per manufacturer’s instructions to obtain results in the linear range of the
assay.
Plaque assay to determine viral titer
Supernatants were collected at the indicated time points and titer was determined by plaque assay on H1-HeLa cells as reported
previously (Foxman et al., 2015). Briefly, H1-HeLa cells in 6 well plates were inoculated with 200 mL of cell lysate, serially diluted
in PBS+0.1% BSA. Plates were incubated at 33�C for 1 hour with rocking, then overlaid with plaque assay medium (1X MEM, 5%
FBS, 0.3% agarose, 30mM MgCl2, 30 mg/ml DEAE-Dextran) and incubated at 33�C for 3 days prior to staining with crystal violet.
siRNA knockdown
siRNAs targeting NRF2 or MAVS, or non-targeting control siRNA, were obtained from GE-Dharmacon and were transfected into pri-
mary human airway epithelial cells following the manufacturer’s protocol for the Dharmafect transfection reagent (GE Dharmacon,
cat#T-2001-02). Cells were transfected when < 30% confluent. Transfection was performed for 6 hr at 37�C, after which the medium
was changed to fresh complete BEGM. Cells were allowed to incubate for additional 2-4 days at 37�C with daily medium changes to
fresh complete BEGM prior to initiating SLR14 stimulation or RV1B infection experiments. Medium was changed to BEGM without
hydrocortisone or epinephrine for experiments.
RNA-Seq sample preparation and sequencing
RNA was prepared from primary cells using RNEasy QIAGEN kit and library preparation was performed at the Yale Center for
Genomic Analysis as follows. mRNA was purified from approximately 500ng of total RNA with oligo-dT beads and sheared by incu-
bation at 94C and cDNA library was prepared using standard protocols. Indexed libraries that met appropriate cut-offs were quan-
tified by qRT-PCR using a commercially available kit (KAPA Biosystems) and insert size distribution determined with the LabChip GX
or Agilent Bioanalyzer. Samples with a yield of R 0.5 ng/ul were used for sequencing. Sample concentrations were normalized to
10 nM and loaded onto Illumina flow cells and sequenced using 75 bp paired-end sequencing on an Illumina HiSeq 2500 per Illumina

 protocols. Signal intensities were converted to individual base calls during a run using the system’s Real Time Analysis (RTA)
software.
Synthesis, purification, and labeling of SLR14-488 nucleotide
The RNA oligonucleotide SLR-14Am (50ppp GGA UCG AUC GAU CG UAmCG CGA UCG AUC GAU CC (Am - aminomodifier C6dT
(Glen Research) was synthesized on a MerMade 12 RNA-DNA synthesizer (BioAutomation) using TBDMS-protected phosphorami-
dites (BioAutomation) as previously described (Zlatev et al., 2012). Base deprotection was carried out in a 1:1 solution of 30% ammo-
nium hydroxide (JT Baker) and 40% methylamine (Sigma) at 65�C for 10 min as described (Wincott et al., 1995). The supernatant was
cooled on ice, transferred to a new vial and evaporated to dryness. Then 0.5 mL of ethanol was added and the mixture was evap-
orated again. In order to deprotect 20-hydroxyl groups, the dry oligonucleotide residue was incubated with 0.5 mL of 1 M solution of
tetrabutylammonium fluoride (TBAF) in THF (Sigma) at room temperature for 36 h. Then 0.5 mL of 2M sodium acetate (pH 6.0) was
added, the mixture was evaporated to a 0.5 mL volume, extracted with 4x 0.8 mL of ethyl acetate and ethanol precipitated. RNA
oligonucleotide was then purified on a 20% denaturing polyacrylamide gel as described (Fedorova et al., 2005). Purified SLR-
14Am oligonucleotide was dissolved in 200 mL of 0.25 M sodium bicarbonate buffer (pH 9.2). Then a solution containing 0.5 mg of
AlexaFluor 488 NHS ester (Life Technologies Corp.) in 200 mL formamide was added and the reaction mixture was incubated at
room temperature for 2 hours. The labeled oligonucleotide (SLR14-488) was ethanol precipitated and purified on a 20% denaturing
polyacrylamide gel as described (Turunen et al., 2014).
QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Statistical comparisons of viral titers, protein expression, and mRNA expression
For comparison of viral titers or gene or protein expression, GraphPad Prism 7.0 was used to determine mean and SD or mean and
SEM of replicates which are graphed as indicated, and p values were determined using an unpaired t test.
RNASeq analysis
The raw reads of RNA-seq experiments were trimmed off sequencing adaptors and low quality regions by btrim (Kong, 2011). The
trimmed reads were mapped to human genome (GRCh37) by tophat2 (Kim et al., 2013). The counts of reads for each gene were
based on Ensembl annotation (release 70). After the counts were collected, the differential expression analysis was done by DEseq2
(Love et al., 2014), which calculated the adjusted p values. Pathway analysis was performed using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis soft-
ware (QIAGEN).
