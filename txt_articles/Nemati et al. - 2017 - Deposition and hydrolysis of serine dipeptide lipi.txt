Microorganisms of the phylum Bacterioidetes are preva-
lent in the human intestinal flora and within this phylum, 
members of the Bacteroides genera represent approximately 
one-third of the cultivable microbial flora of the human 
intestinal microbiome (1, 2). Periodontal diseases are also 
associated with increased percentages of specific Bacte-
roidetes species at periodontal disease sites. Among the 
oral Bacteroidetes, the genera Porphyromonas, Prevotella, 
Tannerella, and Capnocytophaga predominate. Porphyromonas 
gingivalis is considered to be a primary pathogen for 
chronic destructive periodontal disease (3). P. gingivalis 
has also been implicated in the development of athero-
sclerosis in experimental animals (4, 5) and P. gingivalis 
genomic products have been identified in a limited per-
centage of human atherosclerotic artery samples (6–9). 
Periodontal Bacteroidetes pathogens have been shown to 
invade human arterial endothelial cells in culture (10, 11). 
Abstract Multiple reaction monitoring-MS analysis of lipid 
extracts from human carotid endarterectomy and carotid 
 
artery samples from young individuals consistently demon-
strated the presence of bacterial serine dipeptide lipid 
classes, including Lipid 654, an agonist for human and 
mouse Toll-like receptor (TLR)2, and Lipid 430, the deacyl-
ated product of Lipid 654. The relative levels of Lipid 654 
and Lipid 430 were also determined in common oral and in-
testinal bacteria from the phylum Bacteroidetes and human 
serum and brain samples from healthy adults. The median 
Lipid 430/Lipid 654 ratio observed in carotid endarterec-
tomy samples was significantly higher than the median ratio 
in lipid extracts of common oral and intestinal Bacteroidetes 
bacteria, and serum and brain samples from healthy sub-
jects. More importantly, the median Lipid 430/Lipid 654 ra-
tio was significantly elevated in carotid endarterectomies 
when compared with control artery samples. Our results in-
dicate that deacylation of Lipid 654 to Lipid 430 likely oc-
curs in diseased artery walls due to phospholipase A2 enzyme 
activity.
 These results suggest that commensal Bacterio-
detes bacteria of the gut and the oral cavity may contribute 
to the pathogenesis of TLR2-dependent atherosclerosis 
through serine dipeptide lipid deposition and metabolism in 
artery walls.—Nemati, R., C. Dietz, E. J. Anstadt, J. Cervantes,

In contrast to the atherogenic members of the oral flora, 
little is known regarding the capacity of intestinal organ-
isms, particularly intestinal Bacteroidetes organisms, to 
contribute to the development of atherosclerosis.
Serine dipeptide lipids are produced by common oral and 
intestinal Bacteroidetes bacteria (12) and the serine dipep-
tide lipids produced by P. gingivalis engage human and 
mouse Toll-like receptor (TLR)2 (12). The serine lipids of 
P. gingivalis are comprised of two classes. One class is termed 
Lipid 430 and contains a single hydroxyl fatty acid linked to 
a serine-glycine dipeptide. The other class, termed Lipid 654, 
contains two fatty acids. The second fatty acid of Lipid 654 is 
ester-linked to the core hydroxy fatty acid of Lipid 430 (12). 
The Lipid 654 class was originally isolated from Flavobacterium, 
a member of the Bacteroidetes phylum, and was termed 
flavolipin (13, 14). Flavolipin was originally reported to be a 
TLR4 ligand, the canonical receptor for lipopolysaccharide. 
However, our work has shown that Lipid 654 engages TLR2 
and not TLR4 (12). Using ESI-multiple reaction monitoring 
(MRM), we have demonstrated that human blood sera 
samples contain detectable levels of Lipid 654 (15) and lipid 
extracts of diseased periodontal tissues also contain Lipid 
654 (12). Therefore, accumulation of Lipid 654 in human 
tissues represents the presence of an exogenous TLR2 ligand 
produced by organisms of either the oral cavity or intestinal 
tract. TLR2 has been shown in experimental animal models 
to be an important innate immune receptor in the develop-
ment of atherosclerosis (16–18) and TLR2 expression is 
upregulated in human endothelial cells exposed to turbulent 
fluid flow (19, 20). Other than bacterial peptidoglycan (21), 
no other exogenous TLR2 ligands of bacterial origin have 
been identified in human atheromas.
The first goal of this investigation was to determine 
whether Lipid 654 is recovered in lipid extracts of common 
intestinal and oral Bacteroidetes, as well as in lipid extracts 
of human carotid artery tissue, brain, and blood samples. 
Evaluation of Lipid 654 in endarterectomies included the 
fractionation of pooled total lipid extracts from carotid 
endaraterectomy samples using normal phase HPLC with 
neutral solvent followed by acidic refractionation of the 
combined fractions containing Lipid 654. Mass spectro-
metric analysis was used to confirm fractions containing 
Lipid 654. In order to evaluate metabolic breakdown of 
Lipid 654 to Lipid 430, ESI-MRM was used to examine lipid 
extracts of common oral and intestinal Bacteroides bacteria, 
and atherosclerotic or healthy carotid arteries and serum 
samples for the relative levels of Lipid 430 and Lipid 654. 
The median Lipid 430/Lipid 654 ratio for each sample cate-
gory was calculated from electronically integrated MRM 
scans. To further investigate the physiological mechanism 
for conversion of Lipid 654 to Lipid 430 in carotid athero-
mas, we investigated the capacity of common lipases to 
cause deacylation of Lipid 654. Common phospholipase 
(PL) enzyme preparations as well as LPL were investigated 
for their capacity to convert Lipid 654 to Lipid 430. Be-
cause PLA2 was the only enzyme class within our survey 
that converted Lipid 654 to Lipid 430, the last goal of this 
investigation was to evaluate the capacity of PLA2 enzyme 
preparations to hydrolyze Lipid 654 to Lipid 430.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Reagents
BBL biosate peptone, trypticase peptone, yeast extract and brain 
heart infusion (BHI), and HPLC solvents were obtained from Fisher 
Scientific. Porcine pancreatic (PP) PLA2 (600 U/mg protein), 
honey bee venom (HBV) PLA2 (Apis mellifera, 600–2,400 U/mg 
protein), PLA1 from Thermomyces lanuginosus, PLC (Clostridium 
perfringens, 10–50 U/mg protein), PLD (Arachis hypogaea, 300–
700 U/mg protein), LPL (Pseudomonas sp., 50,000 U/mg protein), 
and diisopropylethylamine were obtained from Sigma. For HBV 
PLA2 and PP PLA2, 1 U is the amount of enzyme required to 
hydrolyze 1 mol of soybean L--phosphatidylcholine to L--
lysophosphatidylcholine per minute at pH 8.0 and 37°C. Human 
recombinant secretory (Rs) PLA2 (type V, 9.9 U/mg, 95% 
purity by SDS-PAGE) and human recombinant lipoprotein (RLp) 
PLA2 (platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase, 4.36 U/mg, 95% 
purity by SDS-PAGE) were obtained as N-terminal hexahistadine-
tagged proteins purified from Escherichia coli (Cayman Chemi-
cal, Ann Arbor, MI). One unit is the amount of recombinant 
enzyme required to release 1 mol of 2-nitro-5-thiobenzoic 
acid per minute at 37°C in 25 mM Tris buffer (pH 7.5), 10 mM 
CaCl2, 100 mM KCL with 0.3 mM Triton X-100, 1 mg/ml BSA, 1 mM 
1,2-bis(heptanoylthio) glycerol-3-phosphorylcholine (Cayman 
Chemical), and 0.5 mM 5,5′-dithio-bis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid 
(Cayman Chemical).
Bacterial growth
Bacteria were grown in broth culture, as previously described, 
or were grown on blood agar plates. P. gingivalis was inoculated 
into basal (peptone, trypticase, and yeast extract) medium supple-
mented with hemin and menadione (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) and 
BHI (22). Culture purity was verified by Gram stain, lack of growth 
in aerobic culture, and formation of uniform colonies when in-
oculated on BHI agar plates and grown under anaerobic condi-
tions. The suspension cultures were incubated for 4 days in an 
anaerobic chamber flushed with N2 (80%), CO2 (10%), and H2 
(10%) at 37°C and the bacteria were harvested by centrifugation 
(2,000 g for 2 h).
Lipid extraction, fractionation, and characterization
Lipids were extracted from lyophilized bacterial pellets using 
the method of Bligh and Dyer (23). Lyophilized bacterial samples 
(0.5 g) were dissolved in chloroform:methanol:water (1.33:2.67:1, 
v/v/v, 4 ml), as previously described (22). The mixture was vor-
texed at 15 min intervals for 2 h and the mixture was supple-
mented with 0.75 ml of chloroform and 0.75 ml of (2 N KCl + 0.5 
N K2HPO4). The mixture was vortexed and centrifuged (2,000 g) 
at 20°C for 4 h. The lower organic phase was removed and dried 
under nitrogen.
Human brain samples from neurologically normal subjects 
(ages were not recorded) were obtained as fresh frozen samples 
(Rocky Mountain MS Center at the University of Colorado, Uni-
versity of Colorado Denver, Department of Neurology, Aurora, 
CO) and were stored frozen until processing. Fresh blood sam-
ples were collected from healthy adults using aseptic venipunc-
ture. Carotid artery samples from otherwise healthy individuals 
between the ages of 16 and 36 (n = 6) were provided as fresh fro-
zen samples from the National Disease Research Interchange, 
Philadelphia, PA. Carotid endarterectomy samples were surgically 
excised under sterile operating room conditions from older indi-
viduals, though the donors’ ages were not recorded. A portion of 
each endarterectomy sample was submitted for pathological eval-
uation and the remainder of the sample was stored frozen until 
tissue processing, as described below. Carotid artery, brain, and

blood samples were extracted using the same Bligh and Dyer 
method. New glass test tubes were used for extracting lipids from 
human samples, as well as for storing lipid extracts. The dried 
lipid extracts were dissolved in chloroform and the total lipid 
weight was determined using a Cahn Electrobalance. For mass 
spectral analysis of lipid extracts from individual carotid artery 
samples, 1 mg of each lipid sample was aliquoted and a known 
amount of synthetic D9-Lipid 654 internal standard (24) (0.2 ng/
sample, actual negative ion mass: m/z 662.5) was added to each 
artery sample. Individual human brain and serum samples were 
extracted using the same total lipid extraction procedure and the 
individual lipid samples were stored as dry pellets at 20°C until 
analysis.
For the determination of Lipid 654 levels in the combined end-
arterectomy samples, the dried lipid extracts of a dozen carotid artery 
endarterectomy samples (n = 12 endarterectomy samples) were 
reconstituted in neutral HPLC solvent (hexane:isopropanol:water, 
6:8:0.75, v/v/v, 24 ml), vortexed, and combined (22). The com-
bined endarterectomy lipid extract was centrifuged at 2,500 g for 
10 min and the supernatant removed for HPLC analysis. Semi-
preparative HPLC fractionation was accomplished using a Shi-
madzu HPLC system equipped with dual pumps (LC-10ADvp), 
automated controller (SCL-10Avp), and in-line UV detector 
(SPD-10Avp). Lipids were fractionated using normal phase iso-
cratic separation (Ascentis®Si, 25 cm × 10 mm, 5 m; Supelco 
Analytical) with a solvent flow of 1.8 ml/min and 1 min fractions. 
HPLC solvent was composed of hexane:isopropanol:water (6:8:0.75, 
v/v/v). The effluent was monitored at 205 nm. For pooled lipid 
extracts of carotid endarterectomies, replicate fractionations were 
pooled and dried under nitrogen. The dried samples were recon-
stituted in HPLC solvent for mass spectrometric analysis, as de-
scribed below. Fractions containing Lipid 654 were pooled and 
dried before additional HPLC fractionation.
Acidic HPLC fractionation of Lipid 654
Fractions containing Lipid 654 were further fractionated by 
eluting over the same HPLC column at 1.8 ml/min, but using 
HPLC solvent supplemented with 0.1% acetic acid. Recovery of 
Lipid 654 was verified by ESI-MS or MS/MS as described below.
Enzymatic hydrolysis of synthetic or P. gingivalis Lipid 654
Lipid 654 preparations were dissolved in CHCl3 and were ali-
quoted into 5 ml conical reaction vials and dried. The vials then 
received 1 ml of Tris buffer (10 mM, pH 7.4) with 150 mM NaCl 
and 10 mM CaCl2 (referred to as Tris buffer). The samples were 
sonicated for 20 s (3 watts). PP PLA2, HBV PLA2, or human Rs 
PLA2 enzyme preparations were added to the Lipid 654 suspen-
sions and the samples incubated for the indicated times. Human 
RLp PLA2 hydrolysis of Lipid 654 was performed using Tris buffer 
containing 5 mM EDTA and no CaCl2. At the conclusion of en-
zyme incubations, the samples were acidified with glacial acetic 
acid (25 l) and extracted with CHCl3 (1 ml × 3 extractions). The 
extracts were pooled and dried under nitrogen.
MS
Lipid samples in HPLC fractions from either semi-preparative 
neutral or acidic fractionations were dissolved in the neutral 
HPLC solvent described above and were injected over a normal 
phase column (Ascentis®Si, 3 cm × 2.1 mm, 5 m; Supelco Ana-
lytical) interfaced with an API Qtrap 4000 instrument (Sciex). 
The lipid extracts from individual carotid arteries were first ana-
lyzed using a Shimadzu autosampler (SIL-10ADvp) with an inter-
vening solvent wash between samples to minimize bacterial lipid 
carryover. Lipid samples of specific categories were analyzed as a 
group during the same analysis session. For the analysis of human 
and bacterial samples shown in Fig. 4, a manual injector was used 
for sample introduction. However, mass spectrometric analysis 
also included evaluation of 14 bacterial samples and eight serum 
samples using the autosampler introduction with intervening 
solvent washes between samples. Isocratic neutral HPLC solvent 
was delivered using a Shimadzu LC-10ADvp pump at a flow rate of 
120 l/min. Total ion chromatograms were acquired using nega-
tive ion mode and a mass range of 100–1,800 amu, and MS/MS 
acquisitions used parameters optimized for specific lipid prod-
ucts. Collision energies for negative ion products were typically 
between 30 and 55 V optimized for each precursor ion under 
investigation. Negative ion ESI was carried out at 4,500 V, with a 
declustering potential of 90 V, focusing potential of 350 V, and 
entrance potential of 10 V. MRM negative ion transitions for 
Lipid 654 were m/z 653.5-131.1, 653.5-306.2, 653.5-349.3, and 
653.5-381.4 and ion transitions for Lipid 430 were m/z 430.2-
140.9, 430.3-173.1, and 430.3-382.3. Lipid 430/Lipid 654 ratios 
were calculated using only the m/z 430.3-382.3 and 653.5-381.4 
transitions. The synthetic D9-Lipid 663 internal standard was 
monitored using m/z 662.5-390.5, 662.5-358.4, and 662.5-315.3 
transitions.
Synthesis of Lipid 654 and Lipid 430
The (3R)- and (3S)-(15-methyl-3-((13-methyltetradecanoyl)
oxy)hexadecanoyl)-glycyl-L-serine stereoisomers, abbreviated as 
L-serine-(R)- and -(S)-Lipid 654, were prepared according to a re-
cent report. The details of the synthesis and verification of the 
enantio-enriched (R)- and (S)-Lipid 654 diastereomers can be 
found in (25). Details of the synthesis of diastereomeric Lipid 430 
can also be found in (25).
Statistical analysis
Statistical testing of replicate samples revealed that results 
depicted in Figs. 3 and 4 were not normally distributed and 
were depicted as Box plots. Statistical testing included Kruskal-
Wallis ANOVA with pairwise comparisons using Mann Whitney 
U tests. Results in Fig. 5 were normally distributed (depicted as 
the mean ± SD) and were analyzed by one factor ANOVA with 
pairwise comparisons using the Fisher LSD test.
RESULTS
Recovery of Lipid 430 and Lipid 654 in common 
Bacteroidetes bacteria and carotid endarterectomy lipid 
extracts
Total lipid extracts from fourteen oral Bacteroidetes 
bacterial species and four intestinal Bacteroidetes bacterial 
species were analyzed for Lipid 430 and Lipid 654 as de-
scribed in the Materials and Methods. The Lipid 430/Lipid 
654 ratios ranged from 0.0001 to 0.0055 (Fig. 1) and these 
ratios were averaged for all bacterial samples. Next, lipid 
extracts from carotid endarterectomies (n = 12) were 
pooled and fractionated first by normal phase HPLC, as 
previously described (26). The fractions containing Lipid 
654 were combined and refractionated over the same col-
umn using HPLC solvent supplemented with 0.1% acetic 
acid (26). In order to minimize the likelihood of bacterial 
lipid carryover from columns previously used for bacterial 
lipid separations, a separate semipreparative HPLC col-
umn was used only for the fractionation of carotid artery 
lipids. Also, solvent wash runs were used to confirm the 
lack of carryover between runs. Lipid 654 was recovered

primarily in one fraction (HPLC fraction 13) and Fig. 2 
shows the MS spectrum indicating the characteristic three 
negative ions for the Lipid 654 class (Fig. 2A). Lipids of P. 
gingivalis were fractionated using the same method and the 
maximum abundance of the Lipid 654 lipid class was ob-
served in HPLC fraction 14 (Fig. 2B). MS/MS analysis of 
the most abundant species of Lipid 654 (negative molecu-
lar ion of m/z 653.5) recovered in fraction 13 of pooled 
endarterectomy lipids revealed the spectrum shown in Fig. 
2C. Figure 2D shows the MS/MS spectrum of the most 
abundant molecular ion of the Lipid 654 class recovered in 
HPLC fraction 14 of P. gingivalis lipids. This evidence dem-
onstrates that lipid extracts of human carotid endarterecto-
mies were contaminated with the Lipid 654 class.
Quantifying Lipid 654 levels in lipid extracts of carotid 
artery samples
We next examined lipid extracts of individual carotid 
endarterectomy samples (n = 10) and the individual control 
and endarterectomy carotid artery lipid extracts were first 
analyzed using an autosampler introduction system with 
a solvent wash between individual artery lipid samples. 
Using this approach, all carotid artery lipid extracts were 
shown to contain detectable levels of Lipid 654. Each 
milligram aliquot of arterial lipid extract was spiked with 
D9-Lipid 654 internal standard (0.2 ng, negative ion mass: 
m/z 662.5) in order to quantify the actual level of Lipid 654 
in these arterial lipid extracts. Figure 3A shows the median 
level of Lipid 654 per milligram in total lipid extracts of 
carotid endaraterectomy or control carotid artery samples 
and Fig. 3B shows the range of Lipid 430/Lipid 654 ratios 
measured in the same samples. The median level of Lipid 
654 per milligram of total lipid was 4-fold less in carotid 
endarterectomy lipid samples compared with control artery 
samples. Figure 3B shows, on average, that the atheroma 
samples had a median Lipid 430/Lipid 654 ratio that was 
at least 10-fold higher than that in control carotid artery 
samples.
Fig. 1. Recovery of Lipid 430 and Lipid 654 in com-
mon Bacteroidetes bacteria. The listed bacteria were 
prepared either in broth culture or were streaked on 
blood agar plates. Bacteria grown in broth culture 
were harvested during the late log phase of growth. 
The intestinal species, Bacteroides fragilis, Bacteroides ova-
tus, Parabacteroides medea, and Parabacteroides distasonis, 
were grown on blood agar plates. Bacterial samples 
were collected by centrifugation or scraping colonies 
from blood agar plates. Total lipids were extracted and 
the samples were analyzed for Lipid 654 and Lipid 430 
using ESI-MRM. Lipid 430/Lipid 654 ratios were calcu-
lated from electronically integrated peaks and are 
shown for oral and gastrointestinal Bacteroidetes.

revealed the masses of the three characteristic species of the Lipid 654 class (m/z 654.2, 640.3, and 626.1). B: ESI-MS of HPLC fraction 14

Recovery of Lipid 430 and Lipid 654 in bacterial, human 
brain, and serum samples
The median Lipid 430/Lipid 654 ratios for lipid extracts 
of carotid endarterectomy and control carotid artery samples 
were compared with bacterial, brain, and serum lipid ex-
tracts (Fig. 4). These lipid samples, including the carotid 
lipid extracts, were manually injected and all samples 
within a given category were analyzed as a group during a 
single session. The median Lipid 430/Lipid 654 ratio ob-
served in bacterial lipid extracts was 180 times less than that 
observed in carotid endarterectomies, 11 times less than 
that observed in carotid artery samples from healthy young 
subjects, and 7 times greater than that observed in serum 
samples from healthy subjects. Lipid extracts from human 
brain samples revealed a median Lipid 430/Lipid 654 ratio 
approximately 90 times less than that observed in carotid 
endarterectomies. The differences between the medians 
for these sample categories are significant using the Krus-
kal-Wallace ANOVA (P = 2.199 × 108). The carotid artery 
samples injected by autosampler (Fig. 3) showed essentially 
the same relative decrease in the Lipid 430/Lipid 654 ratio 
as that observed with manually injected lipid extracts (Fig. 4). 
Reanalysis of most of the bacterial lipid extracts using an 
autosampler introduction with intervening solvent washes 
yielded a median Lipid 430/Lipid 654 ratio of 0.00112 
(n = 14 bacterial lipid samples). Most of the serum sam-
ples were also reanalyzed using autosampler introduction 
and this revealed a median Lipid 430/Lipid 654 ratio of 
0.0035 (n = 8).
Hydrolysis of Lipid 654 to Lipid 430 by lipase enzymes
Hydrolysis of Lipid 654 to Lipid 430 in diseased arteries 
will depend on the presence of host enzymes that can 
mediate deacylation of Lipid 654. Macrophage activation is 
associated with increased activity of PLA1, PLA2, PLC, and 
PLD. In addition, LPL has also been implicated in altering 
the course of atherosclerosis. The next goal of this investi-
gation was to evaluate commercial preparations of these 
enzymes for their capacity to hydrolyze Lipid 654 (Fig. 5A). 
This survey revealed that only PLA2 preparations, includ-
ing PP and HBV PLA2 enzyme preparations, hydrolyzed 
Lipid 654 to Lipid 430. These enzymes represent different 
isoforms of secretory PLA2 and, therefore, both require

ectomy samples or carotid artery samples from young individuals. 
Carotid endarterectomy samples (Atheromas, n = 10) were recovered 
at the time of surgical excision; a portion of each endarterectomy 
sample was removed for pathological evaluation and the remainder 
of the sample was frozen until processing. Arteries from young adults 
(Cont Art, n = 6) were recovered at necropsy and fresh frozen as 
processed at the National Disease Research Interchange. Frozen 
samples were thawed and minced into small pieces. The samples 
were extracted for 3 days in organic solvent according to the proce-
dure of Bligh and Dyer and the recovered lipids were dried under a 
stream of nitrogen. The recovered lipids were dissolved in chloro-
form and 1 mg was aliquoted and was supplemented with D9-Lipid 
654 internal standard (0.2 ng/mg total lipid). Samples were then 
dissolved in 500 l of HPLC solvent and analyzed by MRM-MS, as 
described in the Materials and Methods. An autosampler was used 
for sample introduction to the mass spectrometer and each sample 
was followed by a solvent wash to ensure negligible lipid carryover 
between samples. Each P value was determined using the Mann-
Whitney U test. A: Comparison of the Lipid 654 levels versus total

lyzed using ESI-MRM. Lipid 430 and Lipid 654 were quantified 
using ESI-MRM and ratios were calculated from electronically inte-

calcium for hydrolysis of phospholipids. Lipid 654 hydroly-
sis to Lipid 430 by either of these enzyme preparations re-
quired calcium as shown in Fig. 5A. However, PLA1, PLC, 
PLD, and LPL enzyme preparations in the presence of cal-
cium did not promote hydrolysis of Lipid 654 to Lipid 430.
We next compared these secretory PLA2 preparations 
with human Rs and RLp PLA2 preparations for their capac-
ity to hydrolyze Lipid 654. Because PLA2 enzymes are known 
to hydrolyze phospholipids containing only L-gly 
cerol, 
we also evaluated whether these PLA2 preparations were 
enantioselective in hydrolyzing Lipid 654. Highly enriched 
bacterial (Fig. 2B) or synthetic Lipid 654 was aliquoted 
into vials, dried, and sonicated in Tris buffer, as described 
in the Materials and Methods. According to the time 
course of P. gingivalis Lipid 654 hydrolysis by PP PLA2, 
approximately 12 h was required for 50% hydrolysis of 
Lipid 654 (Fig. 5B). Figure 5C shows that only synthetic 
L-serine-(R)-Lipid 654, but not L-serine-(S)-Lipid 654, was 
hydrolyzed by either PP PLA2 or HBV PLA2. Treatment of

fied with acetic acid followed immediately by extraction with CHCl3 (3 × 1 ml extractions). The extracts were dried and analyzed for levels of 
Lipid 654 and Lipid 430 using ESI-MRM. PP PLA2, HBV PLA2, LPL, and PLA1, PLC, and PLD (100 U each) were used for these hydrolyses.

 Serine dipeptide lipids in human atherosclerosis
2005
(shown in Fig. 2A, B) for 3 days with either PP PLA2 or 
HBV PLA2 revealed a 9.655-fold or a 4.25-fold increase, re-
spectively, in the Lipid 430/Lipid 654 ratios, indicating that 
at least a portion of the Lipid 654 isolated from human end-
arterectomies is comprised of (R)-Lipid 654. For Fig. 5D, 
L-serine-(R)- or -(S)-Lipid 654 (5 g per vial or 7.65 mM) 
was sonicated in specified vials containing 1 ml Tris buffer 
and was supplemented with human Rs PLA2 (0.024 U per 
sample). For Fig. 5E, L-serine-(R)- or -(S)-Lipid 654 (5 g 
per vial) were sonicated in vials containing 1 ml Tris buf-
fer containing 5 mM EDTA and no calcium, followed by 
the addition of human RLp PLA2 (0.044 U added per 
sample). These samples were incubated at 37°C for the 
indicated times. Both recombinant human secretory and 
lipoprotein PLA2 preparations hydrolyzed Lipid 654 in a 
manner consistent with the known stereoselective hydroly-
sis of phospholipids containing only L-glycerol. Finally, this 
evidence shows that mammalian PLA2 enzymes are capa-
ble of hydrolyzing Lipid 654 to Lipid 430, providing a pos-
sible explanation for the observed increase in the Lipid 
430 to Lipid 654 ratio in carotid atheromas.
DISCUSSION
Serine dipeptide lipids produced by oral and intestinal 
Bacteroidetes bacteria are consistently recovered in lipid 
extracts of carotid arteries, including atherosclerotic artery 
samples. The absolute amount of Lipid 654 as a percentage 
of the total arterial lipid was 4-fold lower in the carotid end-
arterectomies compared with the control carotid artery 
samples, which would argue that Lipid 654 is not important 
in atherogenesis. However, the lower level of Lipid 654 re-
covered in endarterectomy lipid extracts could be related 
to the substantial accumulation of cholesterol, triglycer-
ides, and other atherogenic lipids in the carotid endarter-
ectomies. By contrast, if atherogenic lipids and Lipid 654 
accumulate coincidentally, the Lipid 654 levels would re-
main essentially unchanged as a percentage of the total 
lipid present. Furthermore, if atherogenic lipid accumula-
tion causes a net decrease in the amount of Lipid 654 in 
lipid extracts of diseased arteries, it should also be reflected 
by a similar dilution of Lipid 430 in the same samples. Be-
cause the median Lipid 654 level in endarterectomy sam-
ples decreased while the median Lipid 430/Lipid 654 ratio 
increased when compared with control artery samples, this 
argues that Lipid 654 is deacylated to Lipid 430, resulting 
in a net loss of Lipid 654. This evidence suggested that con-
version of Lipid 654 to Lipid 430 was increased in carotid 
endarterectomies when compared with carotid artery sam-
ples. The median Lipid 430/Lipid 654 ratio observed in 
Bacteroidetes bacteria is also inconsistent with the direct 
invasion of artery walls by live bacteria. Otherwise, the 
Lipid 430/Lipid 654 ratios would be similar between ca-
rotid artery and bacterial samples. Finally, the median 
Lipid 430/Lipid 654 ratio in carotid endarterectomy 
samples was significantly higher than that observed in 
human brain samples, despite the known vascularity of 
brain tissue. Therefore, the increased level of Lipid 430 
relative to Lipid 654 observed in carotid endarterectomy 
samples is not reflected by similar changes in blood or 
brain tissues, suggesting a local conversion process in dis-
eased arteries.
We previously reported that Lipid 654 mediates effects 
on osteoblasts through engagement of TLR2 (26). How-
ever, Lipid 430 is at least twice as potent on a weight basis 
in mediating cellular effects on bone cells when compared 
with Lipid 654. While purified bacterial Lipid 654 can me-
diate effects on cells, it is not clearly established that the 
actual metabolically active lipid constituent is in fact Lipid 
654. The present report demonstrated that Lipid 430 can 
be produced from Lipid 654 by enzymatic treatment with 
PLA2. The present study also showed that the apparent 
Lipid 654 breakdown to Lipid 430 is most prominent in 
diseased artery samples, but the exact location of the lipid 
deposition and metabolism was not clear. Because com-
mercially available PLA2 preparations require days of ex-
posure to observe substantial hydrolysis of Lipid 654, it 
does not appear feasible to test the hydrolysis of Lipid 654 
in artery tissue homogenates given the likelihood of bacte-
rial growth and production of necrosis-related proteo-
lytic enzymes. Because these bacterial serine lipids are 
amenable to mass spectrometric detection and quantifica-
tion, multidimensional MALDI-TOF evaluation of serial 
sections of endarterectomy samples should clarify the loca-
tion and relative levels of bacterial serine lipid deposits in 
the artery walls relative to the location of atheromas. This 
experimental approach is now feasible.
For the evaluation of enzymatic deacylation of Lipid 654 
to Lipid 430, we examined the capacity of several common 
PL enzyme preparations (PLA1, PLA2, PLC, and PLD), as 
well as LPL, to hydrolyze Lipid 654 to Lipid 430. These 
PL enzyme classes were selected either because of their 
expression in activated macrophages or because of their 
association with atherosclerosis. LPL was included because 
of its association with atherosclerosis (27), though reports 
vary as to whether LPL is proatherogenic (28) or protective 
against atherosclerosis (29). We show here that recombi-
nant PLA2 preparations, including human Rs PLA2 type V 
and human RLp PLA2, catalytically hydrolyze Lipid 654 to 
Lipid 430, despite the fact that these serine lipids are not 
phospholipids. Isoforms of secretory PLA2 previously iden-
tified in atherosclerotic lesions include PLA2 IIA, IID, IIE, 
III, V, and X (30). Of these isoforms, PLA2 isoform III 
(HBV PLA2) and human Rs PLA2 V were shown to hydro-
lyze Lipid 654. Though PP PLA2 is a type IB form of secre-
tory PLA2 and has not been reported in atherosclerotic 
lesions, it also hydrolyzed Lipid 654 to Lipid 430. Secretory 
PLA2 is reported to be elevated in atherosclerotic arteries 
in conjunction with chronic inflammation associated with 
atheroma formation (31, 32). Lipoprotein PLA2 expres-
sion in artery walls and blood is associated with increased 
risk of atherosclerosis development and serious cardiac se-
quelae (33–35). While increased PLA2 activity is associated 
with increased arachidonic acid release and subsequent 
prostaglandin production, the evidence presented here 
suggests that increased PLA2 activity could account for the 
increased conversion of Lipid 654 to Lipid 430 in diseased

arteries. Although it is not established whether Lipid 430 
can activate macrophages, endothelial cells, or arterial 
smooth muscle cells, Lipid 430 is reported to activate hu-
man embryonic kidney cells expressing either human or 
mouse TLR2 (12) and will inhibit bone cell differentiation 
(26). Because the shift in the Lipid 430 to Lipid 654 ratio 
was most pronounced in carotid endarterectomies, our re-
sults suggest that Lipid 654 hydrolysis to Lipid 430 through 
PLA2 enzyme activity may promote atherogenesis through 
engagement of TLR2.
TLRs, in particular TLR2 and TLR4, are reported to be 
important in development of atherosclerosis (16, 18). 
TLR9 appears to play a lesser role in atherosclerosis pro-
motion. Lipid 654 does not engage TLR4 (12). Lipid 654 
exposure to artery walls is potentially important in athero-
genesis for several reasons. First, increased TLR2 expres-
sion is observed in arterial endothelial cells in areas of 
nonlaminar flow of blood, such as artery curvatures, bifur-
cations, and other locations where atheromas are typically 
observed (19, 20). Second, genetically engineered mice 
deficient in LDL or ApoE receptor function demonstrate 
increased susceptibility to atherosclerosis that is reversed if 
mice are simultaneously rendered TLR2 deficient (18, 20). 
Finally, TLR2 engagement is reported to increase PLA2 ex-
pression in monocytes (36), macrophages (37), and synovi-
ocytes (38). Though PLA2 enzymes have been implicated 
in promoting atherogenesis, recent reports indicate that 
pharmacological inhibition of PLA2 has little value in pre-
venting serious cardiovascular events secondary to ath-
erosclerosis. This is particularly true for darapladib that 
specifically inhibits lipoprotein PLA2 (39–41). A recent 
clinical trial was terminated because of an increased risk of 
cardiovascular events for subjects taking the secretory 
PLA2 inhibitor, varespladib (41). However, PLA2 inhibitor 
trials included relatively short-term treatment regimens. If 
PLA2-mediated hydrolysis of Lipid 654 to Lipid 430 is im-
portant in atherogenesis, inhibition of PLA2 would be 
required for extended periods to show benefit. Evidence 
presented here suggests that bacterial serine lipids accu-
mulate in carotid arteries early in life before substantial 
atherogenesis is evident and the conversion to Lipid 430 is 
increased with atheroma formation, suggesting greater 
PLA2 activity in atheromas.
As shown here, Lipid 654 and related lipids are pro-
duced by many members of the phylum Bacteroidetes 
within the human microbiome and, in the case of the gas-
trointestinal tract, the biomass of Bacteroides species ex-
posed to the host is substantial. Oral species in the phylum 
Bacteroidetes could also contribute to the accumulation of 
serine dipeptide lipids in arteries, but the total oral Bacte-
roidetes phylum biomass is considerably less than that of 
the gut. Normal body function is expected to lead to tran-
sient bacteremias from either oral or gut microbiomes, but 
passive transfer/uptake of bacterial lipids into the host can-
not be excluded. However, secondary prevention of ath-
erosclerosis using antibiotics has shown inconsistent results 
(42, 43). Dietary restrictions or modifications that mini-
mize colonization of the oral cavity or intestinal tract with 
species of the phylum Bacteroidetes have not been reported. 
Given that serine dipeptide lipids of Bacteroidetes bacteria 
are recovered in readily detectable amounts in endarterec-
tomies and are likely metabolized within mammalian tis-
sues, it becomes important to establish whether these lipids 
promote atherogenesis in experimental animals. Further-
more, it is important to determine whether vascular and 
immune cells are capable of metabolizing these lipids and 
to characterize the biological properties of these lipids on 
macrophages and cells of the vascular wall. The fact that 
these lipids appear in lipid extracts of carotid arteries in 
relatively young individuals suggests that the process of 
bacterial lipid deposition is followed by subsequent metab-
olism later in life in association with the atherogenesis 
process. It is also not clear whether the cholesterol and 
oxidized lipid product accumulation in artery walls is 
mechanistically related to bacterial lipid deposition and/
or engagement of TLR2. TLR2 is expressed in arteries in 
part because of the flow characteristics of blood, but this 
does not necessarily correlate with cell activation. Further-
more, expression of TLR2 in different cell types associated 
with atheroma formation could vary depending on the lo-
cation of the deposited bacterial lipids. Given that bacterial 
serine dipeptide lipids are now established to contaminate 
human arteries, the question of how these lipids are trans-
ported and deposited in arteries becomes important. Fu-
ture studies will address these possibilities.
