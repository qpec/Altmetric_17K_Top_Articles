A novel mcr variant, named mcr-1.2, encoding a Gln3-to-Leu functional variant of MCR-1, was detected in a KPC-3-producing
ST512 Klebsiella pneumoniae isolate collected in Italy from a surveillance rectal swab from a leukemic child. The mcr-1.2 gene
was carried on a transferable IncX4 plasmid whose structure was very similar to that of mcr-1-bearing plasmids previously
found in Escherichia coli and K. pneumoniae strains from geographically distant sites (Estonia, China, and South Africa).
T
ransferable polymyxin resistance mediated by the plasmid-
borne mcr-1 gene has recently been described in Enterobacte-
riaceae, raising considerable concern (1). The mcr-1 gene product
is a membrane-anchored enzyme able to modify the lipid A poly-
myxin target by addition of phosphoethanolamine, resulting in a
reduction of affinity for polymyxins (1).
The mcr-1 gene has mostly been found in Escherichia coli iso-
lates from animals, but also in those from human and food sam-
ples, and in isolates of other enterobacterial species, with a world-
wide distribution (2). The gene has often been reported in strains
susceptible to other antibiotics, but occasionally also in multi-
drug-resistant (MDR) strains (3–8), including members of high-
risk epidemic lineages spreading in the clinical setting (9, 10).
Thus far, however, it had never been found in Klebsiella pneu-
moniae strains of clonal group 258 (CG258), which is the lineage
mainly responsible for the dissemination of KPC-type carbapen-
emases on the global scale (11, 12).
Here we describe the first detection of a novel mcr variant,
named mcr-1.2, from an MDR KPC-producing K. pneumoniae
strain belonging to sequence type 512 (ST512), a member of
CG258.
Screening for KPC carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteri-
aceae in rectal swabs was carried out using the direct KPC
screening test (DKST), based on direct plating of rectal swabs onto
MacConkey agar in the presence of a meropenem disc and of a
meropenem-plus-phenylboronic acid disc (13). Bacterial identifi-
cationwascarriedoutbymatrix-assistedlaserdesorptionionization–
time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry (Vitek-MS; bio-
Mérieux, Marcy l’Etoile, France). Antimicrobial susceptibility was
determined by reference broth microdilution (14) using custom
plates (Trek Diagnostic Systems, Cleveland, OH, USA), and data
were interpreted according to the EUCAST guidelines (EUCAST
breakpoint tables v6.0). Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) and
analysis were carried out as previously described (15). Plasmid
finishing was achieved by a PCR-based strategy and Sanger se-
quencing. Sequence alignments were performed using Mauve
(16), and physical maps were generated using Easyfig (17). Deter-
mination of the multilocus sequence type, plasmid replicons, and
resistance gene content was performed in silico using online tools
(http://www.genomicepidemiology.org/). Transfer of the colistin
resistance determinant by conjugation was assayed on Mueller-
Hinton (MH) agar plates (Oxoid, Basingstoke, United Kingdom)
with an initial donor/recipient ratio of 0.1, using E. coli J53 (F�
met pro Azir [azide resistance]) as the recipient (18). After incuba-
tion at 35°C for 16 h, transconjugants were selected on MH agar
supplemented with colistin (2 �g/ml) and sodium azide (150 �g/
ml). The transfer frequency was expressed as the number of
transconjugants per recipients (t/r). Transfer of mcr to transcon-
jugants was confirmed by PCR targeting the mcr gene (10).
K. pneumoniae KP-6884 was isolated in 2014 from a rectal sur-
veillance swab obtained from an Italian child admitted to the pe-
diatric onco-hematology ward of Pisa University Hospital. The
strain was preliminarily identified as a putative KPC producer by
the DKST method. The child was receiving a cycle of anticancer
chemotherapy for acute lymphoblastic leukemia and had previ-
ously been admitted twice to the same ward (1 and 2 months
earlier). Of note, the child had not received colistin before the first
isolation of KP-6884.
KP-6884 showed an MDR phenotype, including resistance to
�-lactams, fluoroquinolones, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole,
gentamicin, and colistin, remaining susceptible only to amikacin
and tigecycline (Table 1). As such, KP-6884 exhibited an unusual
phenotype (resistance to gentamicin and trimethoprim-sulfame-
thoxazole and susceptibility to amikacin) compared to that of the
most prevalent carbapenem-resistant (CRE) KPC-producing K.
pneumoniae strain circulating in our setting (19, 20).
To investigate the mechanisms of resistance of KP-6884, a
WGS approach was adopted. The draft genome was de novo as-

bp; L50, 8; average GC, 57.09%), with an estimated genome size of
5,626,271 bp and average coverage of 80�. A total of 5,631 coding
DNA sequences were identified using the PGAP annotation pipe-
line (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/annotation_prok).
In silico analysis of the draft genome confirmed the identifica-
tion of KP-6884 as K. pneumoniae sensu stricto (21) and revealed
that it belonged to ST512.
Screening for acquired resistance determinants revealed the
presence of genes encoding �-lactamases (blaTEM-1, blaSHV-11, and
blaKPC-3), aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes (aadA2, aadA5,
aacA4, and aacC2d), sulfonamide resistance (sul1), trimethoprim
resistance (dfrA17), and colistin resistance (a new mcr gene vari-
ant). Compared to mcr-1 (1), the sole allelic variant thus far de-
scribed, the mcr gene from KP-6884 carried a missense mutation
at position 8 (A¡T) resulting in a Gln-to-Leu change in the N-
terminal protein region. A BLAST search, using this novel allelic
variant, here referred to as mcr-1.2, showed no perfect match with
any of the mcr genes present in the nr/wgs databases (last accessed
11 May 2016). Overall, the acquired resistome of KP-6884 was

FIG 1 Linear map of plasmid pMCR1.2-IT and comparison with previously sequenced mcr-1-carrying IncX4 plasmids. Homologous segments are indicated by
striped shading, representing �99% sequence identity. Genes encoding proteins of known functions are in different colors, as detailed in the legend. Differences
at the sequence level, including single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), insertions (IS), and deletions, are shown by different symbols. Compared to pMCR1.2-
IT, pESTMCR, pMCR1-incX4, and pAf48 differed in 2, 6, and 1 SNPs, respectively. In pESTMCR, SNPs were located within the mcr-1 gene and in an intergenic
region adjacent to hns (n � 1). In pMCR1-IncX4, SNPs were located within the mcr-1 gene, within pap2 (n � 1), in intergenic regions (n � 2), in a gene coding
for a hypothetical protein (n � 1), and in the iteron region (n � 1); in genes coding for the PAP2 transmembrane protein and for MCR, nucleotide substitutions
led to missense mutations. In pAf48, the single SNP was located within the mcr gene; deletions of 1,160 bp and of 388 bp were present in the replication region,
affecting the pir gene and a region upstream of dnaJ, respectively. Other differences consisted of the following: (i) a 22-bp deletion located in the iteron region in
pMCR1-incX4; (ii) an insertion of a single nucleotide downstream of the gene coding for the PAP2 protein and of 5 nucleotides within a gene encoding a
hypothetical protein upstream of mcr-1 in pESTMCR and pAf48; (iii) a 48-bp insertion within a gene encoding a hypothetical protein located between hicA and
dnaJ and a 2-bp deletion within the iteron region in pAf48; and (iv) a single nucleotide insertion within the pilX1 gene in pMCR1-incX4, pESTMCR, and pAf48.

 consistent with the resistance phenotype, including the unusual
gentamicin resistance justified by the presence of the aacC2d gene
(Table 1). Other possible causes of colistin resistance, mediated by
mutations in chromosomal genes (22, 23), were excluded by the
analysis of sequence data. In detail, mgrB, pmrAB, phoPQ, and
crrAB sequences did not show any genetic alteration previously or
potentially associated with colistin resistance (the sequences were
identical to those of colistin-susceptible strains).
Bioinformatic analysis revealed the presence of several plasmid
replicons, including ColE, IncFIA-FIB, IncFII-FIB, IncX3, and
IncX4. The latter was located on the same contig as mcr-1.2. Plas-
mid finishing resulted in a 33.3-kb-long circular molecule, repre-
senting the complete sequence of the IncX4 plasmid carrying mcr-
1.2, named pMCR1.2-IT (Fig. 1). Overall, pMCR1.2-IT was very
similar to other previously sequenced IncX4 plasmids carrying
mcr-1,
namely,
pMCR1-IncX4
(GenBank
accession
no.
KU761327) (24), pESTMCR (GenBank accession no. KU743383),
and pAf48, from a clinical K. pneumoniae isolate from China, an E.
coli isolate from pig sludge in Estonia, and an E. coli clinical isolate
from South Africa (GenBank accession no. KX032520), respec-
tively (25) (Fig. 1). In all these plasmids, the mcr gene was embed-
ded in the same genetic environment, with a downstream gene
encoding the PAP2 transmembrane protein and without an up-
stream ISApl1, unlike what has been observed in other non-IncX4
plasmids (24) (Fig. 1). These findings underscored the broad in-
tercontinental distribution of this type of resistance plasmid.
Gene transfer experiments demonstrated that the mcr-1.2 gene
could be transferred by conjugation from KP-6884 to E. coli J53
with a frequency of 5 � 10�5 (t/r). The colistin MIC of transcon-
jugants showed a 16-fold increase (Table 1), confirming that
MCR-1.2 was functional. The MICs of transconjugants for all
other agents were unchanged.
Concluding remarks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first description of a novel MCR-1 functional variant and also the
first time that an mcr-type gene has been found to be associated
with an ST512 KPC-3-producing high-risk clone of K. pneu-
moniae. Until now, only a few cases of human infections caused by
carbapenemase-producing (NDM-type, VIM-1, KPC-2, OXA-
48), mcr-positive strains of E. coli and K. pneumoniae have been
reported (3–6, 24, 26).
Considering that the clinical use of polymyxins is essentially
restricted to the treatment of invasive infections caused by carbap-
enem-resistant and extensively drug-resistant Gram-negative
nonfermenters, the emergence of transferable colistin resistance
among CRE is a cause of serious concern, especially in settings of
high CRE endemicity. In Pisa University Hospital, where CRE
strains have been endemic since 2010 (13), the rate of colistin
resistance among carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae isolates of
clinical origin was 15% in the year 2014.
Strain KP-6884, however, was responsible for colonization of
an immunocompromised patient in whom the strain did not
cause an invasive infection. Therefore, the pathogenic potential of
KP-6884 and of strains with similar features should be further
investigated in appropriate infection models.
