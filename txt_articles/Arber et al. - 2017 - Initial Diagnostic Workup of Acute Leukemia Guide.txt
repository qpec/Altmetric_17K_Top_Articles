� Context.—A complete diagnosis of acute leukemia
requires knowledge of clinical information combined with
morphologic evaluation, immunophenotyping and karyo-
type analysis, and often, molecular genetic testing.
Although many aspects of the workup for acute leukemia
are well accepted, few guidelines have addressed the
different aspects of the diagnostic evaluation of samples
from patients suspected to have acute leukemia.
Objective.—To develop a guideline for treating physi-
cians and pathologists involved in the diagnostic and
prognostic evaluation of new acute leukemia samples,
including acute lymphoblastic leukemia, acute myeloid
leukemia, and acute leukemias of ambiguous lineage.
Design.—The College of American Pathologists and the
American Society of Hematology convened a panel of
experts in hematology and hematopathology to develop
recommendations. A systematic evidence review was
conducted to address 6 key questions. Recommendations
were derived from strength of evidence, feedback received
during the public comment period, and expert panel
consensus.
Results.—Twenty-seven guideline statements were es-
tablished, which ranged from recommendations on what
clinical and laboratory information should be available as
part of the diagnostic and prognostic evaluation of acute
leukemia samples to what types of testing should be
performed routinely, with recommendations on where
such testing should be performed and how the results
should be reported.
Conclusions.—The guideline provides a framework for
the multiple steps, including laboratory testing, in the
evaluation of acute leukemia samples. Some aspects of the
guideline, especially molecular genetic testing in acute
leukemia, are rapidly changing with new supportive
literature, which will require on-going updates for the
guideline to remain relevant.

T
he laboratory evaluation of patients suspected of having
acute leukemia (AL) is complex and has evolved
significantly with the incorporation of advanced laboratory
techniques. The first broadly accepted classification in
modern history was that of the French-American-British
(FAB) cooperative group, which was initially based entirely
on morphologic features of blast cells on Wright- or Wright-
Giemsa–stained bone marrow smears and a variety of
cytochemical stains.1 With the introduction of clinical
immunophenotyping assays, particularly flow cytometry
immunophenotyping (FCI), the FAB classification was
modified to incorporate limited immunophenotypic studies,
primarily to distinguish minimally
differentiated acute
myeloid leukemia (AML) from acute lymphoblastic leuke-
mia (ALL).2 Immunophenotyping to distinguish precursor
B-cell from precursor T-cell ALL (T-ALL) was not included
nor were other immunophenotypic markers used to define
FAB disease groups, other than identification of the
megakaryocytic lineage in acute megakaryoblastic leuke-
mia.3 Although a few categories of the FAB classification
correlated with recurring cytogenetic abnormalities (partic-

the
classification did not incorporate genetic studies. In 2001,
the 3rd edition4 of the World Health Organization (WHO)
classification of AL was published and formally introduced
the requirement for immunophenotyping and cytogenetic
studies for the diagnosis of AL. The 4th edition5 of the WHO
classification, published in 2008, added additional cytoge-
netic disease groups for AML and ALL, introduced the
category of mixed-phenotype acute leukemia (MPAL), and
included provisional entities of AML that were based on
gene mutation studies. Since 2008, many other mutations
have been described in all types of AL, and epigenetic
changes, including protein and microRNA (miRNA) ex-
pression and global and gene-specific methylation, have
been reported to be common and prognostically relevant in
AL.6,7 The 2016 WHO classification8 of AL continued to
define some disease entities by a combination of morpho-
logic, immunophenotypic, and genetic (including molecular
genetic) changes, but some gene mutations and cytogenetic
abnormalities, although not disease defining, offer signifi-
cant prognostic information. These genetic and epigenetic
changes in AL may be detected by individual, often
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or reverse-transcriptase
PCR-based, assays; by gene panels using next-generation
sequencing (NGS) methods; or by looking at the entire
genome of a given sample. The latter approaches are
becoming increasingly available because of major advances
in molecular genetic testing technology.
Because of the increasing complexity of testing needed to
completely diagnose and predict prognosis in cases of AL,
the College of American Pathologists (CAP) and the
American Society of Hematology (ASH) formed an expert
panel to review the relevant literature and to establish a
guideline for appropriate laboratory testing and for the
clinical information necessary for the initial diagnosis of AL,
including AML, ALL, and ALs of ambiguous lineage. Six
key questions were initially developed, with literature
searches performed based on the initial questions. A draft
guideline was developed by the expert panel and was
modified based on comments received during an open-
comment period. This article describes the process used for
the development of the AL guideline statements, the
strength of evidence for each statement, and the rationale
for the specific recommendations.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
This guideline was developed using an evidence-based meth-
odology intended to meet recommendations for a report from the
Institute of Medicine.9 This guideline is based on the results of a
systematic review (SR) of available evidence. A detailed description
of the methods and SR (including the quality assessment and
complete analysis of the evidence) used to create this guideline can
be found in the supplemental digital content (SDC).
Panel Composition
The CAP Pathology and Laboratory Quality Center (the Center)
and the ASH members included 7 pathologists, one hematologist,
one hematologist/oncologist, and one methodologist consultant.
These panel members served as the expert panel (EP) for the
systematic evidence review and development of the guideline
statements. An advisory panel including one patient advocate, one
cytogeneticist, 3 hematologists/oncologists (including one pediatric
hematologist/oncologist), one medical oncologist, and 2 hemato-
pathologists assisted the EP in determining the project scope and
reviewing and providing guidance on the draft recommendations
and manuscript development.
Conflict of Interest Policy
In accordance with the CAP conflict of interest policy (in effect
April 2010), members of the expert panel disclosed all financial
interests of possible relevance to the guideline, from 12 months
before appointment through publication of the guideline. Individ-
uals were instructed to disclose any relationship that could be
interpreted as constituting an actual, potential, or apparent conflict.
Disclosures were collected by the CAP staff before beginning the
SR and were updated continuously throughout the project at each
virtual and face-to-face meeting. A separate oversight group
(consisting of staff and members of the CAP and ASH) reviewed
the disclosures and agreed that most of the expert panel had no
conflicts of interest. Complete disclosures of the expert panel
members are listed in the Appendix. Disclosures of interest judged
by the oversight group to be conflicts are as follows: D.A.A.,
consultancy and board/advisory board with Celgene Corporation
(Summit, New Jersey), board/advisory board of DAVA Oncology
(Dallas, Texas), Bristol-Myers Squibb (New York, New York),
Novartis (Deerfield, Illinois), and Agios Pharmaceuticals (Cam-
bridge, Massachusetts); M.J.B., grants received from Amgen Inc
(Thousand Oaks, California), Beckman Coulter (Brea, California),
Becton, Dickinson and Company (San Jose, California), Bristol-
Myers Squibb (New York, New York), Genzyme Corporation
(Cambridge, Massachusetts), MedImmune (Gaithersburg, Mary-
land), and Micromet (Rockville, Maryland); K.F., consultancy with
Celgene Corporation (Summit, New Jersey); R.P.H., consultancies
with Cancer and Leukemia Group B, Genzyme Corporation
(Cambridge, Massachusetts), and Incyte Corporation (Wilmington,
Delaware); S.A.W., consultancy with Genzyme Corporation (Cam-
bridge, Massachusetts), board/advisory board with, and grants
received from, Seattle Genetics, Inc (Bothell, Washington), and
GlaxoSmithKline plc (Brentford, United Kingdom). Most of the EP
(6 of 11 members) was assessed as having no relevant conflicts of
interest. The CAP and ASH provided funding for the administra-
tion of the project; no industry funds were used in the development
of the guideline. All panel members volunteered their time and
were not compensated for their involvement, except for the
contracted methodologist. Please see the SDC for full details on
the conflict of interest policy.
Objective
The objective of the guideline is to recommend laboratory testing
for the initial workup for proper diagnosis, determination of
prognostic factors, and possible future monitoring of ALs,
including AML, ALL and ALs of ambiguous lineage, in children
and adults.
The key questions were as follows:
1. What clinical and laboratory information should be available
during the initial diagnostic evaluation of a patient with AL?
2. What specimens and sample types should be evaluated during
the initial workup of a patient with AL?
3. At the time of diagnosis, what tests are required for all patients
for the initial evaluation of an AL?
4. Which tests should be performed on only a subset of patients,
including in response to results from initial tests and
morphology?
5. Where should laboratory testing be performed?
6. How should test results and the diagnosis be correlated and
reported?
Literature Search and Selection
A systematic literature search was completed on October 4, 2011,
for relevant evidence using OvidSP (Ovid Technologies, New York,
New York), PubMed (US National Library of Medicine, Bethesda,
Maryland), and Science Direct (Elsevier, Amsterdam, the Nether-
lands) to identify literature published from January 2005 through
2
Arch Pathol Lab Med
Initial Diagnostic Workup of Acute Leukemia—Arber et al
 September 2011. A literature refresh was completed on April 24,
2013, and again on August 11, 2015, to identify recently published
material. Database searches were supplemented with expert panel
recommendations and the references from those supplemental
articles were reviewed to ensure all relevant publications were
included.
Selection at all 3 levels of the SR was based on predetermined
inclusion/exclusion criteria for the outcomes of interest. Detailed
information about the literature search and selection can be found
in the supplemental data.
Quality Assessment
An assessment of the quality of the evidence was performed for all
retained studies after application of the inclusion and exclusion
criteria by the methodologist (see Supplemental Table 6). Using that
method, studies deemed to be of low quality would not be excluded
from the SR but would be retained and their methodological
strengths and weaknesses discussed where relevant. Studies would
be assessed by confirming the presence of items related to both
internal and external validity, which are all associated with
methodological rigor and a decrease in the risk of bias. The quality
assessment of the studies was performed by determining the risk of
bias by assessing key indicators based on study design against known
criteria. Only studies obtained from our SR were assessed for quality
by these methods and any additional articles brought in to support
the background and to contextualize the findings were not. Each
study was assessed individually (refer to the SDC for individual
assessments and results by guideline statement) and then summa-
rized by study type. A summary of the overall quality of the evidence
was given considering the evidence in totality.
A rating for the strength of evidence is given for guideline
statements for which quality was assessed (ie, only studies obtained
from our SR). Ultimately, the designation (rating) of the strength of
evidence is a judgment by the expert panel of their level of
confidence that the evidence from the studies informing the
recommendations reflects a true effect. Table 1 describes the grades
for strength of evidence. (Refer to the SDC for a detailed discussion
of the quality assessment.)
Assessing the Strength of Recommendations
Development of recommendations required that the EP review
the identified evidence and make a series of key judgments,
including the balance of benefits and harms. Grades for strength of
recommendations were developed by the CAP Pathology and
Laboratory Quality Center and are described in Table 2.
Guideline Revision
This guideline will be reviewed every 4 years, or earlier in the
event of the publication of substantive and high-quality evidence
that could potentially alter the original guideline recommendations.
If necessary, the entire EP will reconvene to discuss potential
changes. When appropriate, the EP will recommend revision of the
guideline to the CAP and ASH for review and approval.

RESULTS
Of the 4901 unique studies identified in the SR, 174
published, peer-reviewed articles were included, which
underwent data extraction and qualitative analysis. Among
the extracted documents, 55 articles/documents did not
meet any inclusion criteria and were excluded from the SR
but retained for discussion purposes.
The EP met 23 times through teleconference webinars
from June 8, 2011, through August 16, 2016. Additional
work was completed via email. The panel met in person July
19, 2013, to review evidence to date and draft recommen-
dations.
A public comment period was held from August 10
through August 31, 2015, on the ASH Web site. Twenty-
nine draft recommendations and 2 demographic questions
were posted for peer review.
Agree and disagree responses were captured for every
proposed recommendation. The Web site also received 789
written
comments.
Twenty-six
draft
recommendations
achieved more than 90% agreement, 2 draft statements
achieved more than 80% to 90% agreement, and 1 received
more than 70% to 80% agreement. Each EP member was
assigned 3 draft statements for which they had to review the
public comments and present them to the entire panel for
group discussion. After consideration of the comments, 2
draft recommendations were maintained with the original
language, 25 were revised, and 2 draft recommendations
were combined into other statements, which resulted in 27
final recommendations.
The panel convened again September 14, 2015, to review
the comments received and revise the recommendations.
Resolution of all changes was obtained by unanimous
consensus of the panel members using a nominal group
technique (rounds of subsequent teleconference webinars
and email discussions). Final EP recommendations were
approved by a formal vote. The panel considered laboratory
efficiency and feasibility throughout the entire process,
although neither cost nor cost-effectiveness analyses were
performed.
An independent review panel, masked to the EP and
vetted through the conflict of interest process, provided a
review of the guideline and recommended the guideline for
approval by the CAP Council on Scientific Affairs and the
ASH Executive Committee. The final recommendations
(guideline statements) are summarized in Table 3.
Guideline Statements
Statement 1.—Strong Recommendation.—The treating
clinician should provide relevant clinical data or ensure that
they are readily accessible by the pathologist.
Note.—These data include, but are not limited to, the
patient’s age; sex; ethnicity; history of any hematologic
disorder or known predisposing conditions or syndromes;
any prior malignancy; exposure to cytotoxic therapy,
immunotherapy, radiotherapy, or other possibly toxic
substances; and any additional clinical findings of diagnostic
or prognostic importance. The treating clinician should also
include any history of possibly confounding factors, such as
recent growth factor therapy, transfusions, or other medi-
cations that might obscure or mimic the features of AL. The
treating clinician should also obtain and provide informa-
tion regarding any family history of any hematologic
disorder or other malignancies.
The strength of evidence was convincing to support this
guideline statement.
Twenty-eight studies, comprising 2 nonrandomized clin-
ical trials (NRCTs)10,11 and 26 prospective cohort studies
(PCSs)12–37 support including data on age. Most of the PCSs
had a risk of bias determination of low to moderate, except
for 3 studies determined to be low12,24,30 and 6 determined to
be moderate.14,22,26,29,32,33 None of those studies were found
to have methodological flaws that would raise concerns
about the studies’ findings. Refer to Supplemental Table 7 in
the SDC for the quality-assessment results for the studies
included for statement 1. For the quality assessment and
summaries of study data for family history, ethnicity, and
performance status, for which there were fewer studies
identified in our SR, refer to Supplemental Tables 1 and 2.
Although it may seem that inspection of blood and
marrow samples is sufficient to make a diagnosis of AL, in
fact, clinical information is often essential for the correct
diagnosis, classification, and/or determination of prognosis.
For example, a patient with a high white blood cell (WBC)
count and 20% blasts in a peripheral blood (PB) leukocyte
differential might be erroneously diagnosed as having AL if
the pathologist is not aware that the blood was from a 1-
week old baby with Down syndrome, in which case, the
more likely diagnosis is transient abnormal myelopoiesis
rather than AL.38–40 Further, if the clinician and/or pathol-
ogist are not aware that a newly diagnosed patient with
AML has a strong family history of leukemia or other
hematologic abnormalities, appropriate genetic testing may
not be performed to confirm a myeloid neoplasm with a
germline predisposition, which, if present, is important not
only for genetic counseling of the patient’s family but also
for the selection of family members as potential donors for
hematopoietic stem cell therapy for the patient.8,41 Although
somewhat unusual, these examples illustrate the importance
of a detailed clinical history, including information regarding
possible predisposing factors, such as a family history of
hematopoietic neoplasms or other hematologic abnormal-
ities, exposure to cytotoxic therapies or other leukemogenic
toxins, and exposure to any medications or known factors
that might mimic the clinical and morphologic features of
AL.
The most routine and basic clinical information—the
patient’s age and sex—are important because of their effect
on prognosis in AL. In our SR of the literature, age emerged
as a statistically significant prognostic factor in AL.10,-37 In

Guideline Statements and Strengths of Recommendations
Guideline Statement
Strength of
Recommendation
1. The treating clinician should provide relevant clinical data or ensure that this is readily
accessible by the pathologist.
Strong recommendation
Note.—These data include, but are not limited to, the patient’s age, sex, and ethnicity;
history of any hematologic disorder or known predisposing conditions or syndromes; any
prior malignancy; exposure to cytotoxic therapy, immunotherapy, radiotherapy, or other
possibly toxic substances; and any additional clinical findings of diagnostic or prognostic
importance. The treating clinician should also include any history of possibly confounding
factors, such as recent growth factor therapy, transfusions or other medications that might
obscure or mimic the features of acute leukemia. The treating clinician should also obtain
and provide information regarding any family history of any hematologic disorders or other
malignancies.
2. The treating clinician should provide relevant physical examination and imaging findings or
ensure that those results are readily accessible by the pathologist.
Recommendation
Note.—This includes, but is not limited to, neurologic exam findings and the presence of
tumor masses (eg, mediastinal), other tissue lesions (eg, cutaneous), and/or organomegaly.
3. The pathologist should review recent or concurrent complete blood cell (CBC) counts and
leukocyte differentials and evaluate a peripheral blood smear.
Strong recommendation
4. The treating clinician or pathologist should obtain a fresh bone marrow aspirate for all patients
suspected of acute leukemia, a portion of which, should be used to make bone marrow
aspirate smears for morphologic evaluation. If performed, the pathologist should evaluate an
adequate bone marrow trephine core biopsy, bone marrow trephine touch preparations, and/or
marrow clots, in conjunction with the bone marrow aspirates.
Strong recommendation
Note.—If bone marrow aspirate material is inadequate or if there is compelling clinical
reason to avoid bone marrow examination, peripheral blood may be used for diagnosis and
ancillary studies if sufficient numbers of blasts are present. If a bone marrow aspirate is
unobtainable, touch imprint preparations of a core biopsy should be prepared and
evaluated, and an additional core biopsy may be submitted unfixed in tissue culture medium
for disaggregation for flow and genetic studies. Optimally, the same physician should
interpret the bone marrow aspirate smears and the core biopsy specimens, or the
interpretations of those specimens should be correlated if performed by different physicians.
5. In addition to morphologic assessment (blood and bone marrow), the pathologist or treating
clinician should obtain sufficient samples and perform conventional cytogenetic analysis (ie,
karyotype), appropriate molecular genetic and/or fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) testing,
and flow cytometric immunophenotyping (FCI). The flow cytometry panel should be sufficient
to distinguish acute myeloid leukemia (including acute promyelocytic leukemia), T-cell acute
lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) (including early T-cell precursor leukemias), B-cell precursor
ALL (B-ALL), and acute leukemia of ambiguous lineage on all patients diagnosed with acute
leukemia. Molecular genetic and/or FISH testing does not, however, replace conventional
cytogenetic analysis.
Strong recommendation
Note.—If sufficient bone marrow aspirate or peripheral blood material is not available for
FCI, immunohistochemical studies may be used as an alternative method for performing
limited immunophenotyping. In addition, a second bone marrow core biopsy can be
obtained and submitted, unfixed in tissue culture media, for disaggregation for genetic
studies and flow cytometry.
6. For patients with suspected or confirmed acute leukemia, the pathologist may request and
evaluate cytochemical studies to assist in the diagnosis and classification of acute myeloid
leukemia (AML).
Expert consensus opinion
7. The treating clinician or pathologist may use cryopreserved cells or nucleic acid, formalin
fixed, nondecalcified paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue, or unstained marrow aspirate or
peripheral blood smears obtained and prepared from peripheral blood, bone marrow aspirate
or other involved tissues for molecular or genetic studies in which the use of such material has
been validated. Such specimens must be properly identified and stored under appropriate
conditions in a laboratory that is in compliance with regulatory and/or accreditation
requirements.
Recommendation
8. For patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) receiving intrathecal therapy, the treating
clinician should obtain a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) sample. The treating clinician or pathologist
should ensure that a cell count is performed and that examination/enumeration of blasts on a
cytocentrifuge preparation is performed and is reviewed by the pathologist.
Strong recommendation
9. For patients with acute leukemia other than those with ALL who are receiving intrathecal
therapy, the treating clinician may, under certain circumstances, obtain a cerebrospinal fluid
(CSF) sample when there is no clinical contraindication. The treating clinician or pathologist
should ensure that a cell count is performed and that examination/enumeration of blasts on a
cytocentrifuge preparation is performed and is reviewed by the pathologist.
Expert consensus opinion
10. For patients with suspected or confirmed acute leukemia, the pathologist may use flow
cytometry in the evaluation of CSF.
Recommendation
11. For patients who present with extramedullary disease without bone marrow or blood
involvement, the pathologist should evaluate a tissue biopsy and process it for morphologic,
immunophenotypic, cytogenetic, and molecular genetic studies, as recommended for the bone
marrow.
Strong recommendation
Note.—Additional biopsies may be indicated to obtain fresh material for ancillary testing.

 ALL children 1 to 9 years old generally had a more-
favorable outcome than those younger than 1 or older than
10 years,17,22,27,34,36 whereas, in AML, patients 60 years old or
older have worse outcomes compared to younger pa-
tients.10,16,23,26,28,34,37
Published evidence revealed that sex was also prognos-
tically important. In childhood ALL, males tended to have a
worse overall prognosis than females did,19,42 although that
difference was not as clear in adult ALL.43 In AML, males
fared worse than females did.44,45

Guideline Statement
Strength of
Recommendation
12. For patients with suspected or confirmed acute leukemia, the pathologist or treating clinician
should ensure that flow cytometry analysis or molecular characterization is comprehensive
enough to allow subsequent detection of minimal residual disease (MRD).
Strong recommendation
13. For pediatric patients with suspected or confirmed B-ALL, the pathologist or treating clinician
should ensure that testing for t(12;21)(p13.2;q22.1); ETV6-RUNX1, t(9;22)(q34.1;q11.2); BCR-
ABL1, KMT2A (MLL) translocation, iAMP21, and trisomy 4 and 10 is performed.
Strong recommendation
14. For adult patients with suspected or confirmed B-ALL, the pathologist or treating clinician
should ensure that testing for t(9;22)(q34.1;q11.2); BCR-ABL1 is performed. In addition, testing
for KMT2A (MLL) translocations may be performed.
Strong recommendation for
testing for t(9;22)(q34.1;q11.2)
and BCR-ABL1;
Recommendation for testing for
KMT2A (MLL) translocations
15. For patients with suspected or confirmed ALL, the pathologist or treating clinician may order
appropriate mutational analysis for selected genes that influence diagnosis, prognosis, and/or
therapeutic management, which includes, but is not limited to, PAX5, JAK1, JAK2, and/or
IKZF1 for B-ALL and NOTCH1 and/or FBXW7 for T-ALL. Testing for overexpression of CRLF2
may also be performed for B-ALL.
Recommendation
16. For pediatric and adult patients with suspected or confirmed acute myeloid leukemia (AML) of
any type, the pathologist or treating clinician should ensure that testing for FLT3-ITD is
performed. The pathologist or treating clinician may order mutational analysis that includes,
but is not limited to, IDH1, IDH2, TET2, WT1, DNMT3A, and/or TP53 for prognostic and/or
therapeutic purposes.
Strong recommendation for
testing for FLT3-ITD

RUNX1-RUNX1T1 or inv(16)(p13.1q22) /t(16;16)(p13.1;q22); CBFB-MYH11), the pathologist or
treating clinician should ensure that appropriate mutational analysis for KIT is performed. For
pediatric patients with confirmed CBF-AML; RUNX1-RUNX1T1 or inv(16)(p13.1q22) /
t(16;16)(p13.1;q22); CBFB-MYH11—the pathologist or treating clinician may ensure that
appropriate mutational analysis for KIT is performed.

Expert consensus opinion for
testing for KIT mutation in
pediatric patients with CBF-
AML
18. For patients with suspected acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), the pathologist or treating
physician should also ensure that rapid detection of PML-RARA is performed. The treating
physician should also order appropriate coagulation studies to evaluate for disseminated
intravascular coagulation (DIC).
Strong recommendation
19. For patients other than those with confirmed core binding factor AML, APL, or AML with
myelodysplasia-related cytogenetic abnormalities, the pathologist or treating clinician should
also ensure that mutational analysis for NPM1, CEBPA, and RUNX1 is also performed.
Strong recommendation
20. For patients with confirmed acute leukemia, no recommendation is made for or against the use
of global/gene-specific methylation, microRNA (miRNA) expression, or gene expression
analysis for diagnosis or prognosis.
No recommendation
21. For patients with confirmed mixed phenotype acute leukemia (MPAL), the pathologist or
treating clinician should ensure that testing for t(9;22)(q34.1;q11.2); BCR-ABL1, and KMT2A
(MLL) translocations is performed.
Strong recommendation
22. All laboratory testing performed for the initial workup and diagnosis of a patient with acute
leukemia must be performed in a laboratory that is in compliance with regulatory and/or
accreditation requirements.
Strong recommendation
23. If after examination of a peripheral blood smear, it is determined that the patient will require
immediate referral to another institution with expertise in the management of acute leukemia
for treatment, the initial institution should, whenever possible, defer invasive procedures,
including bone marrow aspiration and biopsies, to the treatment center to avoid duplicate
procedures, associated patient discomfort, and additional costs.
Strong recommendation
24. If a patient is referred to another institution for treatment, the primary institution should
provide the treatment center with all laboratory results, pathology slides, flow cytometry data,
cytogenetic information, and a list of pending tests at the time of the referral. Pending test
results should be forwarded when they become available.
Strong recommendation
25. In the initial report, the pathologist should include laboratory, morphologic,
immunophenotypic, and, if performed, cytochemical data, on which the diagnosis is based,
along with a list of any pending tests. The pathologist should issue addenda/amended reports
when the results of additional tests become available.
Strong recommendation
26. The pathologist and treating clinician should coordinate and ensure that all tests performed for
classification, management, predicting prognosis, and disease monitoring are entered into the
patient’s medical records.
Strong recommendation
Note.—This information should include the sample source, adequacy, and collection
information, as applicable.
27. Treating physicians and pathologists should use the current World Health Organization (WHO)
terminology for the final diagnosis and classification of acute leukemia.
Strong recommendation

Initial Diagnostic Workup of Acute Leukemia—Arber et al
 Although familial acute leukemia is generally regarded as
rare, an inherited predisposition to hematopoietic neo-
plasms—including AL—is likely more common than
appreciated and can only be recognized by detailed clinical
information.41 Because of the importance of hematopoietic
neoplasms with germline predisposition for genetic coun-
seling and for the detection of family members as potential
donors for hematopoietic stem cell therapy, verified cases of
inherited-predisposition syndromes should be documented
in the patient’s medical record and in the pathology report.
A number of predisposing syndromes with germline
mutations have been described and included in the most
recent revision of the WHO Classification of Tumours of
Haematopoietic and Lymphoid Tissues8; the most well-known
of which include AML with germline CEBPA mutation,46,47
myeloid or lymphoid neoplasms with germline RUNX1
mutation,48,51 myeloid or lymphoid neoplasms with germ-
line ANKRD26 mutation,52,53 and myeloid neoplasms with
GATA2 mutation,54,58 among others. In addition, AL arising
in patients with a background of inherited bone marrow
(BM) failure syndromes, such as dyskeratosis congenita and
other telomerase biology diseases, and Fanconi anemia,
should be recognized in the medical record.41,59,60 Family
histories that include a first-degree or second-degree
relative with AML, ALL, myelodysplastic syndrome
(MDS), persistent thrombocytopenia, clinical bleeding
propensity, immunodeficiency, or a hematologic malignan-
cy at a young age are important clues for AL with germline
predisposition.41,61,62
Therapy-related myeloid neoplasms, including therapy-
related AML (t-AML), are late complications of cytotoxic
chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy administered for a prior
neoplastic or nonneoplastic disorder.63,67 Currently, t-AML
comprises nearly 15% to 20% of all cases of AML, but the
incidence is rising as more patients survive treatment for
their initial cancers.68 Therapy-related lymphoblastic leuke-
mia has been reported but is much less common than t-
AML.69,70
In the WHO classification system, therapy-related mye-
loid neoplasms are recognized as a distinct category for
patients who have a history of prior exposure to alkylating
agents, topoisomerase II inhibitors, antimetabolites, anti-
tubulin agents, and/or ionizing radiation.8
Information regarding the specific therapy implicated in
the pathogenesis of therapy-related myeloid neoplasms is
important because of the correlations between the clinical,
morphological, genetic findings, and prognosis with the
prior therapeutic regimen.65,67,68,71–73
Although most cases of t-AML are thought to be related
to mutational events induced by prior cytotoxic therapy, the
exact mechanisms and pathways involved are not clear.
Most patients treated with cytotoxic therapies do not
develop t-AML, suggesting there may be underlying
predisposing genetic factors.74,75 Thus, the history of
previous cytotoxic therapy in a patient with t-AML or
therapy-related lymphoblastic leukemia is important for
diagnosis and classification but also, perhaps, for identifi-
cation of an inherited predisposition to drug-induced
cancer.76
As noted in the preceding section, a history of radiation
therapy—either alone or in combination with chemotherapy
for prior neoplastic or nonneoplastic conditions—is recog-
nized as being associated with an increased risk for AL,
particularly AML. Radiation exposure for individuals near
natural disasters or atomic bomb explosions is also
associated with an increased risk of leukemia,77,78 and
reportedly, radiation exposure after diagnostic procedures,
including computed tomography scans in children, increas-
es the risk for leukemia.79,80
Patients receiving hematopoietic stem cell therapy are at
increased risk for development of MDS and AML. Such
patients usually receive a combination of chemotherapy and
radiation therapy, and the rate of developing MDS or AML
ranges from 2% to 7.6% in the studies reviewed.81–83 The
incidence appears to be increased in older patients and in
patients who received total-body radiation.78
Exposure to certain chemicals is associated with an
increased risk of development of AL, particularly AML.
Benzene exposure, especially at high levels, is associated
with an increased risk of AML.84,85 Other exposures are
more controversial. Embalmers and funeral-home workers
exposed to formaldehyde are reported to have an increased
mortality rate from AML,86 but a more recent meta-analysis
found no such increase in risk of leukemia for workers
exposed to formaldehyde when results were adjusted for
smoking history.87
The use of recombinant granulocytic growth factors, such
as granulocyte colony-stimulating factor and granulocyte-
macrophage colony-stimulating factor, may transiently
increase blasts in the blood and/or BM, which, in some
cases, may account for 20% or more of the cells and lead to
an erroneous diagnosis of AML. The increase in blasts may
persist up to 5 weeks after cessation of growth factor
therapy.88 The pathologist should be aware of any growth
factor or other cytokine therapy and its time of administra-
tion relative to the BM or blood sample in question to
ascertain whether an elevated blast count is due to AML or
could be attributable to a transient growth factor effect.
In addition, vitamin B12 or folate deficiency can markedly
alter the BM appearance because of a proliferation of
immature erythroblasts, potentially mimicking acute ery-
throid leukemia. It is critical to exclude vitamin B12 or folate
deficiency before making a diagnosis of AL if the BM shows
numerous blasts with erythroid features.89,90
Public Comment Response to Statement 1.—There were 200
respondents to statement 1, of whom, 97% (n¼194) agreed,
and 3% (n ¼ 6) disagreed with the statement. The reason for
the 3% disagreement was not clear. There were 42 written
responses; most of which suggested that the statement
include even more-specific and more-detailed information
and that the data should reside in the patient’s electronic
medical record, where it would be accessible to the
pathologists and treating physicians. The comments were
considered in the final draft of statement 1 in this document.
There is strong evidence, based on our SR, as well as in
literature gathered outside of our SR, to support statement
1. The clinical history is the starting point for the workup of
AL and provides information that may be necessary for
diagnosis, classification, and prognosis. In addition to the
literature, the statement was enthusiastically supported—
almost unanimously—by the respondents during the open
comment period. Refer to Table 4 for study data on age.
Statement 2.—Recommendation.—The treating clinician
should provide relevant physical examination and imaging
findings or ensure that those results are readily accessible by
the pathologist.
Note.—This includes, but is not limited to, neurologic
exam findings and the presence of tumor masses (eg,
mediastinal), other tissue lesions (eg, cutaneous), and/or
organomegaly.

 The strength of evidence was convincing to support this
recommendation.
This recommendation was supported by 4 PCSs.19,20,22,91
One study was deemed to have a low risk of bias,91 2 were
deemed to have a low to moderate risk,19,20 and one was
deemed to have a moderate risk of bias.22 None of those
studies were found to have methodological flaws that would
raise concerns about the studies’ findings.
This recommendation was based on evidence from our SR
as well as from expert consensus opinion. Evidence was
available from the SR only for the relevance of central
nervous system (CNS) involvement—which typically man-
ifests as cranial nerve abnormalities or meningeal symp-
toms—for the outcome of AL (refer to Supplemental Table
3); based on expert opinion, other studies, which did not
meet the criteria for SR, informed the recommendation for
tumor masses, cutaneous lesions, and organomegaly.
Our SR identified 4 PCSs relevant to CNS status at
presentation and outcomes in lymphoblastic leuke-
mia.19,20,22,91 In a study of 4959 noninfant patients with B-
precursor ALL treated between 1986 and 1999 by various
protocols, patients having CNS disease at presentation were
associated with poor outcomes in a multivariate analysis
(hazard ratio [HR], 1.34; P ¼ .04).19 A Nordic study of 2668
children with ALL, who were treated in 2 successive trials
between 1992 and 2007, showed a significantly increased
risk of treatment failure (P , .01 in both study cohorts) if
CNS disease (defined as �5 3 103/mm3 leukemic cells in the
diagnostic spinal tap) was present at presentation.91 A study
of 546 consecutive, pediatric patients from St Jude Child-
ren’s Research Hospital (Memphis, Tennessee) treated from
1984 to 1991 with 2 protocols showed generally worse
event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) when
CNS disease was present at presentation (study 11: EFS, P ,
.001, OS, P ¼ .01; study 12: EFS, P ¼ .03, OS, P ¼ .22).20 In
subsequent studies, improvements in identifying those at
high risk of CNS relapse and with reinduction treatment as
an integral component of overall therapy, differences in EFS
and OS were lessened between those with and those
without CNS involvement.20 A Brazilian study of 229
consecutive children with ALL treated with a single
protocol, for whom 220 were evaluable for CNS status at

 presentation, reported a statistically significant difference (P
, .001) in 5-year EFS between children with (n ¼ 9; 5-year

Supplemental Table 8 for the quality-assessment results of
included studies for statement 2.
Acute leukemia may involve extramedullary sites, such as
mediastinum (thymus and lymph nodes) and skin at
presentation; those sites may be involved before, or
concurrent with, BM and PB cells and may be sites of
disease relapse. In ALL, an anterior mediastinal mass is
present in 8% to 10% of childhood cases and in 15% of adult
cases.92 Mediastinal enlargement visualized on imaging
studies may point to T-lymphoblastic lymphoma/leuke-
mia,93 whereas mediastinal adenopathy was associated with
inferior survival outcome in pediatric ALL (P ¼ .01) in one
PCS.94 Myeloid sarcoma and leukemia cutis are 2 manifes-
tations more commonly associated with AML and usually
require a tissue biopsy for diagnosis95; lymphoblastic
leukemias can also involve the skin.96–98 Enlargement of
liver and spleen are most common sites of extramedullary
involvement in ALL with marked organomegaly being more
frequent in children and uncommon in adults.92 In AML,
palpable splenomegaly or hepatomegaly occurs in about
one-quarter of patients.99 Knowledge of involvement at
those sites can assist the pathologist in making an accurate
diagnosis, offering recommendations for sampling other
sites, and performing ancillary testing.
The EP noted that the physical examination and imaging
information was typically obtained in the course of routine
workup and making such information available should pose
no additional burden on the clinician submitting the
samples.
Public Comment Response to Statement 2.—There were 195
respondents, of whom, 97.44% (n ¼ 190) agreed and 2.56%
(n ¼ 5) disagreed with statement 2. There were 21 written
comments, including a number that suggested adding
imaging studies and that comments regarding mediastinal
disease and cutaneous manifestations be specifically men-
tioned. Others commented that the data should be available
through the electronic medical record. These comments
were taken into consideration in the final draft of statement
2 presented in this article.
Statement 3.—Strong Recommendation.—The pathologist
should review recent or concurrent complete blood cell
(CBC) counts and leukocyte differentials and evaluate a PB
smear.

 The strength of evidence was convincing to support this
guideline statement.
This statement is supported by 51 studies,* comprising
2
randomized,
controlled
trials
(RCTs)113,117;
5
NRCTs11,106,111,112,131; and 44 PCSs.† For the 2 RCTs, the
trial by Lange et al113 was deemed to have a very low risk of
bias, and the trial by Schneider et al117 was deemed to have a
high risk of bias. For the 5 NRCTs, 4 reported a risk of bias
of low to moderate,11,111,112,131 and one reported a moderate
risk of bias.106 For the 44 PCSs, 7 of the studies were deemed
to have a low risk of bias,‡ 30 were deemed to have a low to
moderate risk of bias,§ and 7 were deemed to have a
moderate risk of bias.** None of these studies were found to
have methodological flaws that would raise concerns about
the studies’ findings. Refer to Supplemental Table 9 for the
quality-assessment results of studies included for statement
3.
The diagnosis of AL is usually first suspected when a
patient presents with symptoms related to an abnormal
CBC, such as fatigue or weakness because of low
hemoglobin, bleeding, or bruisability from thrombocytope-
nia, or fever caused by an infection related to neutropenia.
Thus, an abnormal CBC is frequently the starting point for
the workup and evaluation for AL. The CBC may also
identify hematologic abnormalities, such as a dangerously
low hemoglobin level or platelet count, for which thera-
peutic measures are immediately indicated. Lastly, accord-
ing to the guidelines for application of the WHO
classification, inspection of the PB smear is critical because
it may provide evidence for a diagnosis of AL as well as
provide information on features that aid in its classifica-
tion.132
The literature strongly supports the importance of some
CBC parameters as independently significant prognostic
indicators in AL. In AML, numerous studies show a
significant effect of the WBC count on response to therapy,
OS, and/or EFS (P � .05) in all studies cited.†† Similar results
are reported in ALL.‡‡ In some reports of AL, the platelet
count,§§ hemoglobin level,30,116,117 and the percentage of
blasts14,103 were also independent, significant factors in OS
and EFS.
Public Comment Response to Statement 3.—There were 195
respondents, of whom, 96.41% (n ¼ 188) agreed, and 3.59%
(n ¼ 7) disagreed with the statement. The reasons for the
disagreement responses were not stated. The 31 written
comments submitted generally offered strong endorsement
for the statement. Some emphasized that the pathologist
should review the specimen personally and not rely on
reported data; a few indicated the specimen review should
be performed by the treating clinician. These comments
were taken into consideration for the final draft of statement
3 that is presented in this article.
The knowledge gained from evaluation of the CBC and
review of the PB provides information that is important for
diagnostic, prognostic, and classification purposes. The
evidence obtained from our SR strongly supports this
statement, and opinions gathered during the open comment
period were also supportive.
Refer to Table 5 for study data on CBCs.
Statement 4.—Strong Recommendation.—The treating
clinician or pathologist should obtain a fresh BM aspirate
for all patients suspected of AL, a portion of which should
be used to make BM aspirate specimens for morphologic
evaluation. If performed, the pathologist should evaluate an
adequate BM trephine core biopsy, BM trephine touch
preparations, and/or marrow clots, in conjunction with the
BM aspirates.
Note.—If BM aspirate material is inadequate or if there is
compelling clinical reason to avoid BM examination, PB may
be used for diagnosis and ancillary studies if sufficient
numbers of blasts are present. If a BM aspirate is
unobtainable, touch-imprint preparations of a core biopsy
should be prepared and evaluated, and an additional core
biopsy may be submitted, unfixed, in tissue culture medium
for disaggregation for flow and genetic studies. Optimally,
the same physician should interpret the BM aspirate
specimens and the core biopsy specimens, or the interpre-
tations of these specimens should be correlated if performed
by different physicians.
Numerous studies confirm the utility of BM aspirate
specimens in the diagnosis of AL. The BM aspirate is the
optimal specimen for both blast enumeration and dysplasia
assessment for the myeloid and erythroid lineages.132 The
confirmation of a blast percentage of at least 20% in blood
or BM is a WHO requirement for AL diagnosis.132 A manual
differential cell count performed on BM aspirate specimens
is the standard procedure for blast enumeration.
An adequate BM trephine core biopsy provides essential
diagnostic information in patients with AL, including overall
cellularity, assessment of residual hematopoietic cells, extent
of leukemia effacement of the BM as well as distinctive
features that could affect treatment response, such as
necrosis and fibrosis.132–138 In addition, numerous special
stains can be performed on a BM core biopsy section that
can provide both diagnostic and prognostic information in
patients with AL.132,135–138 The breadth of potential stains
includes numerous immunohistochemical stains and some
in situ hybridization stains (ones not adversely affected by
decalcification), and DNA-based molecular studies can also
be performed on the BM core or on clot biopsy sections.
Core biopsy sections assume a greater role in leukemia
diagnosis when an adequate BM aspirate is not obtained.
Adequacy of the BM trephine core biopsy specimen has
been assessed in several studies. In general, an intact core
biopsy specimen that is 1 cm or larger is considered optimal
for diagnosis.133–135,137,139 This specimen cannot consist
largely of cortical or subcortical regions but, instead, must
contain intact hematopoietic regions of the BM.
Touch preparations of the BM core biopsy can potentially
facilitate the AL diagnosis in a variety of ways.132–135,138
Because the touch preparations can be readily prepared
before the BM core biopsy specimen is placed in fixative,
they should be made every time a BM core biopsy is
obtained. The cells in those touch preparations can be
evaluated by Wright-Giemsa stain; differential cell counts
can be performed as well as dysplasia assessment.132–134,138
In addition, these touch-preparation slides can be used for

 cytochemical stains, fluorescence in situ hybridization
(FISH), and molecular studies. Touch-preparation slides
are even more essential in cases in which the BM aspiration
is unsuccessful. This is not an uncommon event in AL cases,
and, in that situation, the touch preparation slides become
the key BM specimen for the blast enumeration, which is
essential for AL diagnosis. The utility of the touch
preparation in BM diagnosis has been confirmed by multiple
comparative studies.132,135,138
Once adequate numbers of BM aspirate specimen slides
have been prepared, the remaining BM aspirate specimen
clots into a semisolid tissue specimen, which can be
wrapped in filter paper and submitted for routine tissue
processing. Because there are no bony trabeculae in this
coagulated aspirate specimen, decalcification is not neces-
sary. Thus, the value of the clot sections is enhanced because
it can be used for the full breadth of molecular studies as
well as for all special stains, immunohistochemical stains,
and for in situ hybridization.132–134,138
The BM clot section can be used for any diagnostic
technique, including many molecular diagnostic techniques
that have been validated for formalin-fixed, paraffin-
embedded (FFPE) tissue.132,133,138 The BM clot section
assumes a greater role in AL diagnosis when an adequate
BM core trephine biopsy specimen has not been obtained.
Public Comment Response to Statement 4.—There were 186
respondents, 94.09% (n ¼ 175) of whom agreed with this
recommendation, and 5.91% (n ¼ 11) who disagreed. The
reasons for the disagreement were stated by only 7
respondents and were either (1) that, in some cases, the
number of blasts in the PB were sufficient for diagnosis and
for all required ancillary studies, and thus, BM studies were
not required (5 respondents); or (2) disagreement as to
whether the specimens should be reviewed by a hematol-
ogist or a pathologist (2 respondents). These comments
were considered in the final draft of statement 4 presented
in this article.
Statement 5.—Strong Recommendation.—In addition to
morphologic assessment (blood and BM), the pathologist or
treating clinician should obtain sufficient samples and
perform conventional cytogenetic analysis (ie, karyotype),
appropriate molecular-genetic and/or FISH testing, and FCI.
The flow cytometry panel should be sufficient to distinguish
acute myeloid leukemia (including acute promyelocytic
leukemia), T-ALL (including early T-cell precursor leuke-
mias), B-cell precursor ALL (B-ALL), and AL of ambiguous
lineage for all patients diagnosed with AL. Molecular
genetic and/or FISH testing does not, however, replace
conventional cytogenetic analysis.
Note.—If sufficient BM aspirate or PB material is not
available for FCI, immunohistochemical studies may be
used as an alternative method for performing limited
immunophenotyping. In addition, a second BM core biopsy
can be obtained and submitted, unfixed, in tissue culture
media for disaggregation for genetic studies and flow
cytometry.
No studies from our SR directly informed this statement.
Specialized testing is essential in the diagnosis of AL and
provides necessary prognostic information and a ‘‘finger-
print’’ of the neoplastic clone that can be used for optimal
minimal residual disease (MRD) monitoring.
Flow cytometry immunophenotyping has an essential role
in the diagnosis and classification of AL. Together with
cytomorphology and cytochemistry, FCI is crucial for the
detection of blasts and lineage assignment of blast cells and
to define AL of ambiguous lineage. In addition, specific
immunophenotypic profiles have been associated with
prognosis and/or unique cytogenetic and molecular abnor-
malities, such as AML with t(15;17)(q24.1;q21.2),
t(8;21)(q22;q22.1).
An adequate FCI panel should be able to determine not
only AML, B-ALL, and T-ALL but also AL of ambiguous
lineages, including acute, undifferentiated leukemia and
MPAL. Acute leukemia of ambiguous lineage has been
confirmed to be a poor-risk disease.140 Furthermore, within
each subset of AL, FCI panel/markers should be able to
effectively subcategorize the blasts. In AML, FCI may help to
determine blasts with monocytic differentiation and myelo-
peroxidase (MPO) expression141 and to recognize acute
promyelocytic leukemia (APL) or APL mimics142–144 and
blasts with erythroid145 or megakaryoblastic differentia-
tion.146 In T-ALL, the FCI panel should include sufficient
markers to identify early T-cell precursor lymphoblastic
leukemia.147 In addition, FCI may provide therapeutic
marker measurement, such as CD20 in B-ALL, for a
frontline rituximab-containing regimen.148
Although no standard FCI panels are mandated for all
laboratories, there are recommendations for instrumenta-
tion, preanalytic variables, panel design, data analysis, and
validation by the EuroFlow Consortium (Leiden, the
Netherlands),149 the British Committee for Standards in
Haematology (London, United Kingdom),150 and the
International Clinical Cytometry Society (Glenview, Illi-
nois).151,152
The role of cytogenetics in diagnosis, classification, and
prognosis in AL is well established and predates the period
used for our SR.153,154 During the past 30 years, cytogenetic
studies have become an integral part of the diagnosis,
prognosis, and treatment of AML and ALL in children and
adults.155–157 Studies that preceded the dates of our SR and
expert opinion informed this recommendation.
The value of conventional cytogenetic studies as a critical
prognostic indicator in AL has been proven in numerous
clinical trials in AML*** and ALL††† and now provides a
basis for classification174 and choice of initial and post-
remission therapy.175–178 With testing widely available in
academic and reference laboratories, conventional cytoge-
netics reveals a clonal abnormality in 40% to 50% of patients
with AML and in 60% to 85% of patients with ALL; the
success rate at diagnosis is typically in excess of 84% for ALL
and 90% for AML in experienced laboratories.156,157,179
Importantly, new karyotypic abnormalities continue to be
described that may not be apparent by other routine
techniques.179,180 Including cytogenetic analysis as part of
the diagnostic workup of AML, ALL, and AL of ambiguous
lineage is endorsed by the National Comprehensive Cancer
Network (Fort Washington, Pennsylvania) clinical practice
guidelines181 and in the (now archived) British Committee
for Standards in Haematology Guidelines on the Management
of Acute Myeloid Leukaemia in Adults.182
Molecular genetic and/or FISH testing should be consid-
ered complementary to an adequate conventional cytoge-
netic analysis. Unless the cytogenetic analysis is suboptimal
because of poor chromosome morphology or insufficient
cells for analysis or is completely unsuccessful because of no
growth, FISH analysis may be an expensive, redundant

 technology, particularly in AML.183–185 On the other hand,
certain abnormalities encountered in ALL, such as
t(12;21)(p13.2;q22.1) ETV6-RUNX1 fusion or intrachromo-
somal amplification of chromosome 21 (iAMP21), can be
cytogenetically cryptic and are optimally detected by
interphase or metaphase FISH.183,186 In general, the utility
of FISH should be considered in the context of each case,
and to that end, algorithmic approaches for using conven-
tional cytogenetics and FISH have been proposed by several
groups.185,187–189
Because of the critical importance of FCI and various
genetic studies in AL diagnosis, prognosis, and disease
monitoring, it is essential that a battery of specialized tests
be performed on all cases. Consequently, a concerted effort
to obtain adequate specimens for specialized studies is
mandatory.
Public Comment Response to Statement 5.—There were 186
respondents, of whom, 94.09% (n ¼ 175) agreed, and 5.91%
(n ¼ 11) disagreed with the statement. No clearly defined
reasons for disagreeing were stated. There were 34 written
comments, including one comment that only qualified
cytogeneticists or pathologists subspecialized in cytogenet-
ics, rather than ‘‘pathologists’’ should ‘‘perform’’ the
cytogenetic studies, and another comment said that targeted
FISH and molecular methodologies should replace conven-
tional karyotyping for patients with ALL. The comments
were considered in the final draft of statement 5 presented
in this article.
Statement 6.—Expert Consensus Opinion.—For patients
with suspected or confirmed AL, the pathologist may
request and evaluate cytochemical studies to assist in the
diagnosis and classification of AML.
The strength of evidence was insufficient for this state-
ment.
No evidence from our SR informed this statement.
Cytochemical stains were historically the primary labora-
tory adjunct to routine morphology for classification of AL.
Other techniques, particularly immunophenotyping, have
largely supplanted them. Nonetheless, cytochemical studies
still have some utility in some circumstances.
Evidence identified external to our SR indicated that 2
cytochemical stains have continued utility in AML diagno-
sis: MPO and nonspecific esterase stains. Both can be
performed on air-dried, unfixed, unstained slides of blood,
imprint specimens, and BM aspirate specimens.133,136,190
Myeloperoxidase is uniquely valuable because it can be
performed within 5 to 10 minutes and is available 24 hours a
day, 7 days a week in many laboratories.190 The rapid
diagnosis of APL is considered to be a medical emergency
because of the risk of major hemorrhage,191 and MPO
staining can be particularly helpful in cases of the micro-
granular variant of APL. The detection of MPO positivity in
3% or more of the blasts is a criteria for myeloid lineage
delineation in AML.192 Similarly, nonspecific esterase
positivity is one of the defining criteria for monoblast/
promonocyte identification in AML.192 Other historically
used stains, including Sudan black B, periodic acid–Schiff, or
acid phosphatase, were not considered to have sufficient
specificity for routine use in the classification of AL.
Public Comment Response to Statement 6.—There were 185
respondents, of whom, 92.97% (n ¼ 172) agreed, and 7.03%
(n ¼ 13) disagreed. Although the reason for the disagree-
ments was not clearly stated, there were 29 written
comments. Three individuals explicitly commented that

 the recommendation should have been stronger, whereas
another 3 commented that cytochemical stains were no
longer necessary. These comments were considered in the
final draft of statement 6 in this article.
In part because there are no studies showing the
independent value of these stains, but recognizing that the
speed and low cost of these techniques can have utility in
some circumstances, expert consensus opinion supports the
optional use of these stains.
Statement 7.—Recommendation.—The treating clinician or
pathologist may use cryopreserved cells or nucleic acid,
nondecalcified FFPE tissue, or unstained marrow aspirate or
PB specimens obtained and prepared from PB, BM aspirate
or other involved tissues for molecular or genetic studies in
which the use of such material has been validated. Such
specimens must be properly identified and stored under
appropriate conditions in a laboratory that is in compliance
with regulatory and/or accreditation requirements.
The strength of evidence was adequate to support this
guideline statement.
This statement was supported by 4 PCSs193–196 that met
the inclusion criteria for our SR. Two of the studies193,194
were deemed to have a low risk of bias, and the other 2195,196
were deemed to have a low to moderate risk of bias. None
of these studies were found to have methodological flaws
that would raise concerns about the studies’ findings. Refer
to Supplemental Table 10 for the quality-assessment results
of studies included studies in statement 7.
The purpose of this guideline statement is to encourage
preservation of cells from blood, BM, or other tissues that
can be used to identify molecular, genetic, and/or antigenic
abnormalities of leukemia cells that may be of further
diagnostic or prognostic importance or that may be a target
for a specific therapeutic agent but that were not assessed
during the initial evaluation. The availability of preserved
leukemic cells could spare the patient an additional BM
procedure if there are no blasts in the PB, or, if, after
therapy, there are few or no neoplastic cells in the marrow.
This recommendation applies to initial diagnostic specimens
as well as subsequent specimens with evidence of residual
or recurrent disease.
Our SR provided no data that specifically informs this
recommendation. Preserved cells are, however, invaluable
for clinical research and are often used in cooperative group
studies for clinical trials in which genetic abnormalities are
performed in a central laboratory. Nevertheless, only a few
studies in the SR specifically mention or allude to the use of
preserved cells as the specimen source for the studies
performed.193–196
Historically, cryopreservation was the most commonly
employed method of preserving cells.197 Cryopreserved
leukemia cells can be used for the extraction of DNA and
RNA for molecular genetic studies.198–200 Although karyo-
typic analyses of cryopreserved cells have been reported, the
number of analyzable metaphases is fewer and their quality
is inferior to those from fresh samples.201,202 Thus, fresh cells
are clearly preferable for karyotyping, and cryopreserved
cells should be used only when no other cells are obtainable,
and the results should be considered with caution. In
contrast, cryopreserved cells can be successfully studied for
specific chromosomal abnormalities by FISH,203,204 which
can also be applied to properly stored specimens and
cytospin or touch preparations on glass slides. Immuno-
phenotyping by flow cytometry may be performed on
cryopreserved cells, although some antigens or cells
expressing those antigens may deteriorate during the
freeze-thaw cycle. These latter, detrimental effects appear
to depend, in part, on the protocols used for cryopreserva-
tion and cell storage and, perhaps, on the cell lineage.205–216
Cryopreservation procedures require mononuclear cells
be suspended in a solution containing a cryoprotective agent
(usually dimethyl sulfoxide), cooled in a cooling device to
the storage temperature, and then stored in liquid nitrogen
(for use in studies in which viable cells are necessary) or a
�808 freezer, which is satisfactory for most molecular
studies. Cryopreservation does require specialized equip-

 ment and storage facilities, which may not be available in all
laboratories.
Nucleic acid extraction from FFPE tissues can be used for
molecular studies as well, particularly for NGS and micro-
array technologies. In general, the use of FFPE cells has
been most successful for DNA-based analyses,217–221 where-
as RNA extracted from such specimens is fragmented by
formalin fixation and is often of poor quality.222–225
Nevertheless, the expression pattern of small RNAs, eg,
miRNAs, extracted from FFPE is reportedly similar to that
derived from cryopreserved cells.226,227 DNA and RNA for
molecular studies may also be obtained from archived
cytology and specimen preparations on glass slides.228–230
Public Comment Response to Statement 7.—There were 184
respondents to this statement, of whom, 97.28% (n ¼ 179)
agreed, and 2.72% (n ¼ 5) disagreed. There was no specific
issue identified by those who disagreed. However, there
were 19 written comments, among which, were 4 that
emphasized that the preserved specimens and cells should
be held in Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments
of 1988 (CLIA ’88)–approved facilities under controlled
conditions and should only be used for studies for which
such specimens had been validated. These comments were
considered in the final draft of statement 7 in this article.
Statement 8.—Strong Recommendation.—For patients with
ALL receiving intrathecal therapy, the treating clinician
should obtain a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) sample. The
treating clinician or pathologist should ensure that a cell
count is performed and that examination/enumeration of
blasts on a cytocentrifuge preparation is performed and is
reviewed by the pathologist.
Acute lymphoblastic leukemia may involve the CNS, both
at diagnosis and at relapse, and patients with CNS
involvement require specific therapy. For that reason,
knowledge of CSF status at the time of diagnosis has long
been known to be important for proper management of
patients. Because alteration of CNS therapy based on CSF
findings has been standard practice for so long, there are no
large-scale clinical trials using modern therapy that dem-
onstrate adverse prognosis of CNS leukemia in the absence
of therapy, although several have investigated the outcome
of patients based on CSF involvement in the context of
CNS-directed therapy.
Although there was no evidence from our SR to inform
this statement, evidence obtained external to our SR and
relevant to this statement includes 2 practice guidelines231,232
that speak to the need to perform CSF cell count and
morphology on patients with ALL, resulting in the now
standard classification of CNS involvement as CNS-1
(negative), CNS-2 (blasts with WBC counts ,5/mm3), and
CNS-3 (blasts with WBC counts �5/mm3).
Several retrospective reviews of RCTs of pediatric
ALL233–235 specifically investigated the effect of CNS
involvement and concluded that long-term outcome was
not affected, provided appropriate therapy was given,
although CNS relapse rates among patients with CNS-2
or CNS-3 disease have sometimes been found to be
different.233 One older study236 showed that patients with
blasts had an adverse prognosis, independent of blast count,
but therapy was different in that study. Limited data were
identified for adult patients with ALL, although one small
study237 suggested that CSF blasts were associated with
adverse outcome.
Public Comment Response to Statement 8.—There were 180
respondents, of whom, 92.22% (n ¼ 166) agreed, and 7.78%
(n ¼ 14) disagreed. There were 20 written comments.
Although a few respondents did not believe this to be
required in all cases, others pointed out that there may be
contraindications to obtaining a CSF in some patients,
particularly when the peripheral blast count is high and that
the initial CSF is typically obtained not at the time of
diagnosis, but rather, after the diagnosis was made and
intrathecal therapy planned, even if circumstances delayed
the timing of the lumbar puncture. In the initial wording of
this statement, there was also some confusion about who
should obtain the CSF. The issue of obtaining flow
cytometry on the CSF fluid was also raised. These important
comments were considered in the final draft of statement 8
in this article. The wording was changed to reflect the
clinical practice of obtaining CSF at the time of intrathecal
therapy, and wording about the clinical contraindication
was not included because that was presumed to be covered
by the association with administration of intrathecal
therapy. Also raised in commentary was the need for flow
cytometry, but that is covered in statement 10.
Irrespective of conclusions regarding the independent
prognostic significance of finding blasts, it is clear that
classification of CNS status requires knowledge of both the
cell count and the morphologic assessment for blasts and
affects most ALL protocols; thus, we consider this a strong
recommendation.
Statement 9.—Expert Consensus Opinion.—For patients
with AL, other than those with ALL, receiving intrathecal
therapy, the treating clinician may, under certain circum-
stances, obtain a CSF sample when there is no clinical
contraindication. The treating clinician or pathologist should
ensure that a cell count is performed and that examination/
enumeration of blasts on a cytocentrifuge preparation is
performed and is reviewed by the pathologist.
The strength of evidence was insufficient to support this
guideline statement. No data from the SR informed this
statement.
This statement is regarding CSF evaluation at the time of
diagnosis for patients with AL, other than those who have
ALL, undergoing intrathecal therapy/prophylaxis and cov-
ered in statement 8. This recommendation is based on
expert consensus opinion arising from controversial issues
regarding clinical significance, indications, and timing of
CSF examination in AL.
The CSF evaluation may be indicated for patients with any
CNS signs and symptoms, for those who are suspected of
having ocular involvement, for patients with increased risk
of CNS involvement or later CNS relapse, or per protocol
requirement. Central nervous system involvement at the
time AML is diagnosed is uncommon in adults, and the risk
factors include younger age, high leukocyte count, high
lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level, African American
ethnicity, and 11q23.3/KMT2A abnormalities.238–241 Because
of a low incidence of CNS involvement, routine evaluation is
often not recommended for adult patients with asymptom-
atic AML. The reported incidence of CNS involvement in
childhood AML ranges from 6% to 29%123,242 and is higher
in patients younger than 2 years old, in patients with AML
and high WBC and peripheral blast counts, in patients with
AML and monocytic differentiation, in patients with AML
and inv(16)(p13.1q22) or t(16;16)(p13.1;q22), and in patients
with AML and hyperdiploidy.123,242,243 Rarely, CNS disease
may present as extramedullary involvement that precedes
clinically evident AML.244–246 Clinical risks for lumbar
puncture (LP) in patients diagnosed with AL include
20

 increased intracranial pressure and severe coagulopathy.
The presence of high numbers of circulating blasts may
introduce blasts in the CNS if a traumatic LP occurs.247,248
An LP should be performed only when there is no clinical
contraindication.
If an LP is performed, CSF should be sent for WBC count
with differential, total RBC count, and a cytocentrifuge
preparation, similar to any other routine CSF examination
for suspected CNS tumor involvement. The pathologist
should review the slides to determine the presence or
absence of blasts via light microscopy. The characteristic
features of leukemia cells, either lymphoblasts or myelo-
blasts, are best seen on Wright-Giemsa–stained prepara-
tions, although use of other stains, such as Papanicolaou
and Diff-Quik, varies in clinical laboratories. In addition, the
detection of blasts via cytomorphology in a low–cell-count,
CSF specimen may depend on the sensitivity of the
cytocentrifuge used for preparation of the specimen.249
Although CNS involvement in ALL is classified into 3
categories as CNS1, CNS2, and CNS3, according to total
WBC and RBC counts and the presence or absence of
blasts,231,233 the threshold for a definitive, positive CNS
involvement in nonlymphoblastic leukemia varies among
different groups. The Italian Cooperative Study Group on
Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (Bologna, Italy),250 the Pediatric
Oncology Group (Monrovia, California),251 and St Jude
Children’s Research Hospital238 define CNS involvement as
the presence of any blasts, regardless of total cell count,
whereas the Children’s Cancer Group (Monrovia, Califor-
nia)252 and the International Berlin-Frankfurt-M ¨
unster
Study Group (Kiel, Germany)253 use a WBC threshold of 5
and 10/mm3 with the presence of blasts, respectively. In
children, CNS involvement at the time of AML diagnosis is
often thought to confer a worse prognosis252,254,255; however,
recent studies showed that CNS involvement might not
have significant effect on survival.123,242,256,257 A large cohort
study by the Children’s Oncology Group (Monrovia,
California)123 showed that, although CNS involvement at
AML diagnosis had no effect on OS, affected patients did
have an increased risk of isolated CNS relapse and had an
inferior leukemia EFS. On the other hand, the prognostic
significance of CNS involvement at the time of AML
diagnosis in adults is controversial.240,241,258 The use of
chemotherapeutic agents that offer greater penetration of
the CNS, such as high-dose cytarabine and cladribine, may
have increased the eradication of low-level CNS involve-
ment without requiring additional CNS-directed thera-
py.259,260 Of note, recent induction chemotherapy regimens
designed primarily for elderly patients with AML do not
include high-dose cytarabine, and whether those induction
protocols would result in an increased risk for CNS relapse
is unknown.241
Public Comment Response to Statement 9.—There were 184
respondents, 96.2% (n ¼ 177) of whom agreed with the
statement, and 3.8% (n ¼ 7) disagreed. There were 31
written comments. The comments received during the open
comment period were related to the indications, timing, and
risks of LP. Specifically, a number of commenters suggested
deferring LP until after the first cycle of chemotherapy to
avoid a traumatic LP in patients with high circulating blasts.
Some also advocated performing CSF evaluation in all
patients with AL. These comments and concerns have been
incorporated in the final draft of statement 9 and are
addressed in the preceding text.
Statement 10.—Recommendation.—For patients with sus-
pected or confirmed AL, the pathologist may use flow
cytometry in the evaluation of CSF.
As discussed in statements 8 and 9, examination of the
CSF is indicated in cases of ALL and may be indicated in
some cases of AML. Definitive determination of CSF
involvement by AL is based on identification of blasts by
visual inspection of a CSF cytocentrifuge preparation;
however, flow cytometry may provide immunophenotypic
information to confirm the morphologic impression of the
presence of blasts.
No evidence from our SR informed this statement;
however, evidence identified outside our SR indicated that
flow cytometry can effectively detect disease in CSF samples
from patients with ALL261,262 and can detect subtle leukemic
involvement in some cytologically negative CSF samples
from both pediatric and adult patients with B-ALL and T-
ALL.263,264 Moreover, patients with ALL and CSF disease
not detected by visual inspection of cytocentrifuge prepa-
rations but detectable by flow cytometry involvement have
shorter OS times than do those with no involvement
detected by flow cytometry (P ¼ .01 on multivariate
analysis).265 Based on this evidence, a recommendation is
made that flow cytometry be performed on CSF samples
taken to evaluate for leukemic involvement in patients
diagnosed with ALL; although the expert opinion is that
AML blasts can also be detected in the CSF by flow
cytometry, we identified one study to support that practice
for AML.266
Public Comment Response to Statement 10.—There were 181
respondents, of whom, 92.82% (n ¼ 168) agreed, and 7.18%
(n ¼ 13) who disagreed. There were 27 written comments.
Of the 27 who wrote specific comments, 15 thought that the
words ‘‘pathologists may use flow cytometry’’ should be
changed to ‘‘should use flow cytometry.’’ The question in
the survey was, however, slightly different and indicated
that ‘‘the pathologists may use flow cytometry in the
evaluation of CSF when sufficient cells are available.’’ These
comments were taken into consideration in the final draft of
statement 10 in this article.
Statement 11.—Strong Recommendation.—For patients
who present with extramedullary disease without BM or
blood involvement, the pathologist should evaluate a tissue

cytogenetic, and molecular genetic studies, as recommend-
ed for the BM.
Note.—Additional biopsies may be indicated to obtain
fresh material for ancillary testing.
No evidence from our SR informed this statement.
Patients with AL may present initially with extramedullary
disease. Extramedullary AL (myeloid sarcoma) has been
shown to present months, or even years, before AML
becomes evident in the BM or PB in some patients.267–271
Myeloid sarcoma also can occur in patients with MDS,
myeloproliferative neoplasms, or myelodysplastic/myelo-
proliferative neoplasms whose BM or PB may never meet
the diagnostic criteria for AML. The incidence of extramed-
ullary leukemic involvement varies widely among reports in
the literature.268,269,272–275 Sites of isolated myeloid sarcoma
can occur in the bone, periosteum, soft tissues, lymph
nodes, CNS, orbit, intestine, mediastinum, epidural region,
testis, uterus, or ovary. Similarly, patients with acute
lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma (ALL/LBL) may present
with extramedullary disease. Patients with T-cell ALL/LBL
often present with a mediastinal mass, lymphadenopathy, or

21
 other extranodal tissue mass.276,277 Most patients with B-
ALL present with PB and BM leukemia, but about 10% of
patients may have an isolated extramedullary presenta-
tion.278,279 Skin, bone, and soft tissue are the most frequently
reported sites of extramedullary involvement in B-cell ALL/
LBL.280
Fresh specimens, either fine-needle aspirate, excisional
biopsy, or body-effusion fluids, are adequate for leukemia
workup.267,281–286 Similar to the analysis for BM and PB
samples, the workup includes morphologic examination,
FCI, and cytogenetic and molecular studies. In patients with
suspected CNS leukemia,287 a CSF sample may be obtained.
Cytocentrifuge preparation with Wright-Giemsa staining
should be performed for morphologic examination, and, if
sufficient numbers of blasts are present, CSF can be used for
ancillary studies. Fine-needle aspiration samples or body
fluids with cell-block preparation and excisional or core
needle biopsy with a portion of the tissue fixed and paraffin
embedded can be used for morphologic examination,
immunohistochemistry and targeted FISH, and some
mutational studies. The targeted FISH panel and molecular
studies for these tissue samples should be performed
according to the recommendations for the BM and PB
workup for different types of leukemia. For myeloid
sarcoma, the frequent cytogenetic abnormalities found in
adults are þ8, KMT2A translocations, inv(16), þ4, �16,
del(16q)/loss of 16q, del(5q), del(20q), and þ11.255,286,288
Nucleophosmin (nucleolar phosphoprotein B23, numatrin)
(NPM1) mutations have been reported in 15% of patients
with extramedullary myeloid tumors, as determined by
immunohistochemical studies,289 and fms-related tyrosine
kinase 3 internal tandem duplication (FLT3-ITD) mutations
have been reported in 15% of cases of myeloid sarcoma.290
Public Comment Response to Statement 11.—There were 185
respondents, of whom, 97.84% (n ¼ 181) who agreed, and
2.16% (n ¼ 4) who disagreed. There were 17 written
comments. Concerns raised in these comments revolved
around several practical issues. First, what are the indica-
tions to prompt an AL workup on tissue biopsies or fluid
specimens when BM and PB have no sign to suggest AL?
Air-dried touch imprints of tissue biopsy specimens or
smears/cytocentrifuge preparations of fluids may have great
utility in that scenario. Wright-Giemsa–stained slides allow
for the assessment of the cytologic features. Cytochemical
studies for MPO or nonspecific esterase can also be
performed to raise the suspicion, thereby facilitating triage
of the specimen for further workup. Touch imprints can also
be used for FISH studies when a diagnosis of AL is
confirmed.271 Of note, in reviews of myeloid sarcoma
published in the literature,272,275,291 nearly 50% of cases
were initially misdiagnosed, most often as malignant
lymphoma. With the advent of immunohistochemistry,
most cases can be diagnosed correctly by applying proper
immunohistochemical stains. A number of immunohisto-
chemical markers have been shown to have diagnostic
utility in extramedullary leukemia,267,281,292,293 including
immature hematopoietic markers, such as CD34, CD117,
and TdT; lineage markers, such as CD3, PAX5, CD19,
CD79a, MPO, and CD61; monocytic markers; and markers
for blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasms. The
second concern raised was that the biopsy tissue sample
may be small, especially in patients with cutaneous
involvement, and there may not be sufficient tissue for a
complete AL workup. Paraffin-embedded tissue samples
should be the priority in such circumstances. Paraffin-
embedded tissue is adequate for immunohistochemical
analysis, FISH, and some molecular testing.267,281–284,286
When a diagnosis of extramedullary leukemia is confirmed
or highly suspected based on the initial biopsy, additional
biopsies may be indicated to obtain fresh material for
ancillary testing.
Some comments also suggested that BM or PB that
contains a substantial proportion of blasts, even less than
20%, is a more desirable material than tissue/fluids for an
AL workup. Although this is largely true for lymphoblastic
lymphoma/leukemia, it is less clear in myeloid sarcoma.
Pileri and colleagues286 compared the results of FISH
performed on myeloid sarcoma tissues and conventional
cytogenetic analysis performed on BM or PB. A full
concordance between the FISH and conventional cytoge-
netic results was found in 71% of patients with available
results. This finding suggests that conventional cytogenetic
studies on BM or PB and targeted FISH analysis on myeloid
sarcoma are complementary and may be pursued in the
appropriate clinical setting. Some responders also suggested
that extramedullary tumors need a complete workup, even
in patients with 20% or more blasts in BM and PB. Although
there is no clear evidence to support or reject that approach,
the consensus is that, in a case with a full leukemia workup
completed using BM and PB, the workup using tissue
samples may primarily focus on confirming the diagnosis.
Based on those findings, the EP concluded that, for
patients who present with extramedullary disease without
BM or PB involvement, the pathologist should evaluate a
tissue biopsy specimen and process it for morphologic,
immunophenotypic, cytogenetic, and molecular genetic
studies, as recommended for the PB and/or BM.
Statement 12.—Strong Recommendation.—For patients
with suspected or confirmed AL, the pathologist or treating
clinician should ensure that flow cytometry analysis or
molecular characterization is comprehensive enough to
allow subsequent detection of MRD.
The strength of evidence was convincing to support this
guideline statement.
This recommendation was supported by 15 studies that
met the inclusion criteria for our SR,18,20,22,91,294–304 compris-
ing one RCT304 and 14 PCSs.18,20,22,91,294–303 The single RCT,
reported by Yin et al304 in 2012, was deemed to have a
moderate risk of bias. For the 14 PCSs, 2 studies91,299 were
deemed to have a low risk of bias, 10 were deemed to have a
low to moderate risk of bias,‡‡‡ and 2 were deemed to have a
moderate risk of bias.22,294 Overall, none of these 15 studies
were found to have methodological flaws that would raise
concerns about the studies’ findings. Refer to Supplemental
Table 11 for the quality-assessment results of studies for
statement 12.
Minimal residual disease is a powerful predictor of
adverse outcome in patients with AL. Although measure-
ment of MRD per se is outside the scope of this
recommendation, because it is, by definition, not performed
at the time of diagnosis, it is important that the initial
diagnostic material be handled in such a way that MRD
testing on subsequent samples is possible. Minimal residual
disease may be measured by flow cytometry or by molecular
testing; the latter encompasses a variety of techniques,
including quantitative PCR detection of antigen-receptor
rearrangements, of fusion transcripts of leukemic translo-

 cations, or of mutated genes. Next-generation sequencing
has increasingly been used as a tool for MRD detection.
Nine studies demonstrated the importance of detecting
MRD in ALL.§§§ The studies differed in methodology (PCR
versus flow cytometry), the timing of the sample, cutoff
values, and the outcome variable measured (EFS, relapse
rate, OS), but all showed a statistically significant effect on
the outcome variable measured.
There were 4 studies that demonstrated the importance of
detecting MRD in AML.294,298,301,304 Two of those studies
used reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) and were limited
to core-binding factor (CBF) AML.298,304 The other 2 used
flow cytometry.294,301 All showed that MRD was an
important factor in relapse-free survival (RFS) and, in some
studies, OS.
One study demonstrated the prognostic significance of
MRD detection in MPAL.296
Three studies addressed the question of comparing the
value of MRD detection by flow cytometry compared with
molecular studies in ALL.22,297,300 In all 3, neither method
was found to be superior. There were no studies identified
that addressed that question in AML
Numerous publications were identified external to our SR,
which offered evidence that information obtained from
diagnostic material was important for the subsequent
detection of MRD, and only a few are referenced here.
Flow cytometric MRD detection in both ALL and AML often
depends on the persistence of cells with a particular
leukemia-associated immunophenotype identified at the
time of diagnosis.305–308 Even when flow cytometry methods
that depend on recognizing differences between normal and
abnormal cells are used,309,310 it is advantageous to be able to
compare initial and posttreatment phenotypes because
those often change in predictable ways. Molecular methods
of detecting MRD in both ALL and AML require that
leukemic cells be characterized and sequenced at diagnosis,
whether MRD detection is performed by conventional PCR-
based techniques311–313 or by NGS.314,315
Public Comment Response to Statement 12.—There were 179
respondents, of whom, 94.41% (n ¼ 169) agreed with the
statement, and 5.59% (n¼10) who disagreed. There were 19
written comments. However, for the open comment period,
the original draft statement was written to address only
patients with suspected or confirmed ALL. Comments
offered were largely directed at the conduct and/or timing
of subsequent MRD studies and were considered in the final
draft of statement 12 for this article.
This statement is designated as having a strong recom-
mendation. Clinicians and pathologists should be mindful,
at the time of initial workup of AL, of the requirements for
subsequent MRD studies. Much of the molecular testing
required can be performed on preserved material obtained
as specified in statement 7. However, material is frequently
not preserved in such a way that flow cytometry can be
readily performed after the fact. Thus, it is imperative that, in
settings in which flow cytometric MRD detection is
contemplated, initial immunophenotyping be performed in
such a manner so as to optimize that testing. Refer to Table
6 for study data on MRD.
Statement 13.—Strong Recommendation.—For pediatric
patients with suspected or confirmed B-ALL, the patholo-
gist or treating clinician should ensure that testing for
t(12;21)(p13.2;q22.1); ETV6-RUNX1, t(9;22)(q34.1;q11.2);
BCR-ABL1, KMT2A (previously MLL) translocation;
iAMP21; and trisomy 4 and 10 is performed.
The strength of evidence was considered adequate to
support this guideline statement.
This statement is supported by 6 PCSs18–20,91,124,316 that
met the inclusion criteria for our SR. Risk of bias
assessments ranged from low91,316 to low to moder-
ate.18–20,124 None of those studies were found to have
methodological flaws that would raise concerns about the
studies’ findings. Refer to Supplemental Table 12 for the
quality-assessment results of studies included for statement
13.
Prognosis in pediatric patients with B-ALL varies with
low-risk patient 5-year EFS approaching 90%, whereas
high-risk patient 5-year EFS was less than 45%.170 Risk
stratification supports risk-directed therapy to optimize
patient care while minimizing unnecessary risks associated
with treatment. Factors used for risk assessment include
age, WBC count, genetic abnormalities (as in this recom-
mendation), early response to therapy, CNS involvement,
and MRD level.
Systematic literature review shows several important
markers for risk stratification in pediatric B-ALL, including
t(12;21)(p13.2;q22.1); ETV6-RUNX1, t(9;22)(q34.1;q11.2);
BCR-ABL1, KMT2A (previously MLL) translocation;
iAMP21; and trisomy 4 and 10. The PCSs showed specific
prognostic information allowing risk stratification associated
with each of those markers. In the most recent clinical trial
from each article, the presence of t(12;21)(p13.2;q22.1);
ETV6-RUNX118,19,91,316 or trisomy of the 4 and 10 chromo-
somes19 conferred improved 5-year EFS (P , .001 for both)
and OS (P , .001 for both) in cooperative group studies.
Interestingly, the more-recent studies (St Jude studies 13A
and 13B) in another series failed to show significant
prognostic impact for t(12;21) on EFS or OS,20 perhaps
because of improved OS for patients with B-ALL resulting
from therapeutic improvements and the introduction of
MRD evaluation for risk stratification. The t(12;21) is the
most common recurrent cytogenetic abnormality in pediat-
ric B-ALL (approximately 25% of patients) and is cryptic by
classic cytogenetic evaluation. An alternate method, such as
FISH or multiplex RT-PCR, is required for detection of that
abnormality and should be performed in all pediatric
patients with B-ALL.
Other abnormalities conferring a poor prognosis include
t(9;22); BCR-ABL1; hypodiploidy (or decreased DNA index);
KMT2A (previously MLL) translocation with slow early
treatment response; and iAMP21. However, recent evidence
indicates that tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy,
combined with intensive chemotherapy, leads to a good
outcome in children and adolescents with B-ALL who have
the BCR-ABL1 mutation as their sole abnormality.317
Fortunately, BCR-ABL1þ B-ALL is significantly less common
in children than it is in adults, accounting for only 2% to 4%
in that patient population. Our SR included PCSs demon-
strating decreased 5-year EFS (P , .01)18–20,91 and OS (P ,
.01)18–20 in patients with t(9;22); BCR-ABL1; and t(4;11) but
not other 11q23 (KMT2A/MLL) abnormalities.18–20,91 In
addition, iAMP21 was associated with decreased EFS (P ,
.001)124,318 and OS (P ¼ .01)124; (P ¼ .02)318 in pediatric
patients with B-ALL, as well as separately in the subset of
standard-risk but not high-risk patients.318 In addition,
intensifying treatment for patients with iAMP21 reduced the
likelihood of relapse and improved survival.319

 Pediatric treatment algorithms rely on accurate risk
stratification so that patients with higher-risk disease receive
appropriately intensified therapy. Genetic abnormalities, as
defined in this statement, are an important aspect of

prognosis,

statement 15.

 which covered a range of issues including queries regarding
specific methodology for detection of the genetic abnor-
malities, detection of Philadelphia chromosome (Ph)-like B-
ALL, the necessity for obtaining BCR-ABL1 transcripts at
diagnosis, and the costs of these tests. These comments
were taken into consideration in the final draft statement for
this article.
Statement 14.—Strong Recommendation for Testing for
t(9;22)(q34.1;q11.2); BCR-ABL1; Recommendation for Testing
for KMT2A (previously MLL) Translocations.—For adult
patients with suspected or confirmed B-ALL, the patholo-
gist or treating clinician should ensure that testing for
t(9;22)(q34.1;q11.2); BCR-ABL1 is performed. In addition,
testing for KMT2A (previously MLL) translocations may be
performed.
The strength of evidence was adequate to support this
guideline statement.
This statement was supported by 2 PCSs17,171 that met the
inclusion criteria for our SR. These studies were deemed to
have a low to moderate risk of bias. None of these studies
were found to have methodological flaws that would raise
concerns about the studies’ findings. Refer to Supplemental
Table 13 for the quality-assessment results of studies
included for statement 14.
The presence of the Ph chromosome or BCR-ABL1 fusion
was the most-common, recurrent abnormality in adult B-
ALL affecting approximately 25% of patients. This abnor-
mality is an independent risk factor conferring poor
prognosis, as demonstrated by several studies and was
supported by the Moorman et al171 study that was part of
Table 6.

 our SR. The t(9;22)(q34.1;q11.2), associated with the BCR-
ABL1 fusion, is detected by conventional cytogenetic
studies in approximately 95% of patients; however, a
molecular genetic method, such as RT-PCR or FISH
analysis, is required for detection in the remaining,
approximately 5%, of cases. In addition, with the incorpo-
ration of BCR-ABL1 TKIs as front-line therapy for Phþ B-
ALL, rapid detection of the abnormality is often required
and may be best obtained using RT-PCR or FISH analysis,
thus, allowing a more-rapid treatment decision in those
patients. Demonstrating the BCR-ABL1 fusion by quanti-
tative RT-PCR at the time of diagnosis is necessary if
subsequent MRD monitoring by the same method will be
used.
In the PCS by Moorman et al,171 1522 patients with ALL
were studied, and BCR-ABL1 fusion detected was detected
in 19% by conventional cytogenetics, RT-PCR, and/or
FISH. Patients with Phþ ALL had significantly inferior 5-
year EFS (16% versus 36%) and OS (22% versus 41%)
(both P , .001 adjusting for age, sex, and WBC count)171 in
comparison to patients lacking the BCR-ABL1 fusion.
Those patients were treated on protocols before the
incorporation of imatinib for patients with Phþ disease.
Studies incorporating TKIs into therapeutic regimens show
improved outcome in adults with Phþ B-ALL in compar-
ison to Phþ patients not receiving TKIs320,321 and suggest
that improvement can be enhanced by the addition of
hematopoietic cell transplantation.322,323 Thus, the detec-
tion of BCR-ABL1 fusion in adults with B-ALL is essential
to determine prognosis and to identify those patients who
will benefit from a BCR-ABL1 TKI.
KMT2A (previously MLL) translocations, an abnormality
present in approximately 10% of adult patients with ALL,
are also considered a poor-risk abnormality in adult
patients with B-ALL. In the study by Moorman et al,171
patients with a cytogenetic presence of t(4;11) had
significantly inferior EFS (P , .001) and OS (P , .001)
when compared with patients with Ph� disease. Other
KMT2A translocations did not show statistically significant
differences.
The SR also included studies showing the possible
prognostic effect of other markers, although those markers
did not reach the level of evidence required for recommen-
dation. Of note, one study17 investigating brain and acute
leukemia cytoplasmic (BAALC) expression by RT-PCR
showed elevated levels were associated with an immature
phenotype and primary therapy resistance in adult patients
with B-ALL (P ¼ .01). In addition, patients with BCR-ABL1�
or KMT2A� disease with higher BAALC expression had
shorter OS rates (P ¼ .03).17
Predicting the prognosis and determining the optimal
therapy is important for all patients with AL. In adults with
B-ALL, the most significant prognostic factor is the presence
of the BCR-ABL1 fusion, a finding associated with a poor
prognosis. Optimal therapy for that patient subset requires
identification of BCR-ABL1 and initiation of an appropriate
TKI therapy. Other genetic markers associated with adult
and pediatric B-ALL are discussed in statement 15.
Public Comment Response to Statement 14.—There were 180
respondents, of whom, 95% (n ¼ 171) agreed, and 5% (n ¼
9) disagreed. There were 26 written comments that were,
generally, supportive but were similar to those for statement
13 regarding clarification of specific methodology and the
necessity of BCR-ABL1 transcripts at diagnosis for BCR-
ABL1þ ALL. These comments were considered in the final
draft of statement 14 for this article.
Statement 15.—Recommendation.—For patients with sus-
pected or confirmed ALL, the pathologist or treating
clinician may order appropriate mutational analyses for
selected genes that influence diagnosis, prognosis, and/or
therapeutic management, which includes, but is not limited
to, PAX5, JAK1, JAK2, and/or IKZF1 for B-ALL and NOTCH1
and/or FBXW7 for T-ALL. Testing for overexpression of
CRLF2 may also be performed for B-ALL.
The strength of evidence was adequate to support this
guideline statement.
This recommendation was supported by 14 PCSs.****
One of the studies was deemed to have a low risk of bias,334

and 3 were deemed to have a moderate risk of bias.327,331,332
None of those studies were found to have methodological
flaws that would raise concerns about the studies’ findings.
Refer to Supplemental Table 14 for the quality-assessment
results of studies included for statement 15.
In addition to gene fusions from chromosomal transloca-
tions, such as BCR-ABL1, and numerical abnormalities, such
as trisomy 4 and 10 in pediatric B-ALL, a number of gene
alterations have also been shown to have independent
prognostic and therapeutic effect in ALL. Literature review
revealed several genes that may contribute to risk stratifi-
cation, including PAX5, Janus kinase 1 (JAK1), Janus kinase
2 (JAK2), IKAROS family zinc finger 1 (IKZF1), cytokine
receptor-like factor 2 (CRLF2), notch homolog 1 (NOTCH1),
and F-box and WD repeat domain containing 7 (FBXW7).
We also recognize that information regarding genetic
information in ALL is rapidly expanding, and evidence
supporting disease-related, relevant markers continues to
evolve. Additional markers may also be useful.
PAX5, a transcription factor required for B-lymphoid
development and located on chromosome arm 9p, may be
important for leukemogenesis, although evidence for
independent contribution of PAX5 alterations to patient
prognosis has varied. PAX5 alterations occur in approxi-
mately 30% to 35% of B-ALL by deletion, fusion translo-
cations, or point mutations. Deletions of PAX5 occur in the
greatest proportion of patients when concurrent BCR-ABL1
or TCF3-PBX1 is present.
Our SR included 4 PCSs that addressed PAX5 muta-
tion.36,302,325,327 Only one study36 on adolescent/adult BCR-
ABL1� B-ALL showed significantly improved prognosis in a
multivariate analysis for patients with PAX5 alterations,
including improved EFS (P ¼ .02), RFS (P ¼ .05), and OS (P
¼.03). Another study in adult B-ALL demonstrated improved
complete response (CR) rate (P ¼ .03), although PAX5
alterations had no significant effect on cumulative incidence
of relapse and disease-free survival (DFS).325 The 2 pediatric
studies showed no significant difference in prognosis in high-
risk B-ALL302 and no difference in PAX5 alterations when
comparing a small relapse-prone cohort with an unselected B-
ALL cohort.327 Although PAX5 abnormalities are common in
B-ALL, more data may be needed to determine whether these
abnormalities assist with risk stratification. Of note, a small
subset of patients with B-ALL (2%–3%) show structural
rearrangements resulting in fusion proteins, with PAX5-JAK2
identified as a recurrent abnormality. The presence of PAX5-
JAK2 fusion protein can result in the constitutively activated
JAK-STAT pathway raising the possibility that this represents
a TKI target for therapeutic intervention.
IKZF1 encodes for the IKAROS zinc finger binding
protein and is associated with a poor prognosis in B-ALL.
Alterations in IKZF1 occur in more than 80% of patients
with BCR-ABL1þ ALL who may be associated with
resistance to TKIs.335 Our SR included 3 PCSs (1 adoles-
cent/adult36 and 2 pediatric302,327) and overall supported the
poor prognosis of IKZF1 alterations in BCR-ABL1� B-ALL.
In adolescent/adult patients with Ph� B-ALL, IKZF1
alterations were associated with inferior EFS (P ¼ .01),
DFS (P ¼ .06), and OS (P ¼ .10) in univariate analysis;
although significance was not demonstrated in multivariate
analysis.36 In pediatric patients with high-risk B-ALL (very
high risk and BCR-ABL1 excluded), IKZF1 alteration was
associated with elevated MRD (P ¼ .04, day 8; P ¼ .001, day
29) and increased incidence of relapse (P , .001).302 That
study noted similarity between the gene expression signa-
ture of high-risk BCR-ABL1� ALL from the original cohort
and the gene signature of BCR-ABL1þ ALL in the validation
cohort. The poor prognosis of IKZF1 was independent of
BCR-ABL1 status. Another pediatric study327 supported the
poor prognosis of IKZF1 alterations with an increased
proportion of patients with IKZF1 deletion in their small
cohort of relapse-prone ALL.
Overexpression of the cytokine receptor CRLF2 is
associated with a poor prognosis in B-ALL and often results
from translocations of CRLF2 with partner genes, such as
the immunoglobulin heavy-chain gene (IGH) or P2RY8.
CRLF2 overexpression is seen in 5% to 16% of pediatric and
adult B-ALL, more than 50% of Down syndrome ALL, and
approximately 50% of BCR-ABL1–like B-ALL (see discus-
sion of BCR-ABL1–like B-ALL below). CRLF2 alterations are
also associated with concurrent IKZF1 deletion and/or
mutation, JAK1/JAK2 mutations, and a poor prognosis in
Table 7.

 adult and pediatric B-ALL.36,330,336 Our SR included 3 PCSs
(1 adolescent/adult36 and 2 pediatric330,332). CRLF2 deregu-
lation in adolescents/adults was associated with decreased
5-year RFS (P¼ .03) and OS (P¼ .04).36 In pediatric patients,
CRLF2 high-level expression was associated with worse EFS
rates (P ¼ .01) and greater cumulative risk of relapse (P ¼
.01), mainly because of the high incidence of relapse in non–
high-risk patients with P2RY8-CRLF2.330 Gene expression
profiling in pediatric patients with high-risk B-ALL showed
an expression cluster with CRLF2 rearrangements, JAK
mutations, IKZF1 deletions, BCR-ABL1–like signature, and a
very poor prognosis.332 Increasing interest in CRLF2 status
has occurred, particularly in light of its high incidence in
BCR-ABL1–like ALL. CRLF2 overexpression may be detect-
ed by flow cytometry or FISH assays.
Regarding the prognostic significance of JAK1 and JAK2
mutations alone in ALL (without CRLF2), no data were
available from our SR.
BCR-ABL1–like (or Ph-like) ALL has been recently
recognized and is of particular prognostic importance. These
leukemias lack the BCR-ABL1 fusion but have a gene
expression profile similar to BCR-ABL1þ leukemia and are
associated with a poor prognosis. One expression array
study in pediatric B-ALL patients identified the BCR-ABL1–
like phenotype and showed an increased relapse rate (P ,
.05) and decreased 5-year DFS (P , .03) in that subset of
patients when compared with other forms of B-ALL (BCR-
ABL1þ ALL excluded).328 A separate, large study337 of B-ALL
reported a frequency of BCR-ABL1–like ALL ranging from
10% for standard-risk, pediatric patients with ALL, up to
27% among young adults with ALL. In most of those
patients (91%) a kinase-activating alteration, such as ABL1,
ABL2, CRLF2, JAK2, or platelet-derived growth factor
receptor b (PDGFRB), was identified suggesting that at least
some patients may benefit from TKI therapy. The most
common gene expression alteration identified in BCR-
ABL1–like ALL, as well as Down syndrome–associated
ALL, was elevated CRLF2 expression, occurring in approx-
imately 50% of patients. Concurrent JAK2 or JAK1, IL7R,
FLT3, SH2B3, and NRAS mutations were also present in
30% to 55% of patients with CRLF2 overexpression.
Deletions involving IKZF1, PAX5, and EBF1 were also
detected in patients with Ph-like ALL.8
For T-ALL, our SR revealed data about alterations of
several genes.
NOTCH1 and FBXW7 mutations frequently occur in T-
ALL, and both result in decreased NOTCH1 activity. Some
studies suggest an improved early response to therapy and
prognosis in these patients, although others lack prognostic
significance. Those discrepancies may be the result of
different treatment regimens. Our SR included 5 PCSs (3
adult; 2 pediatric). Of those studies, results of studies of
adults with T-ALL and NOTCH1 and/or FBXW7 mutations
include one showing an improved median EFS (P ¼ .02) and
OS (P ¼ .01) in multivariate analysis,326 whereas 2 showed
no prognostic significance,21,329 although a trend toward
improved EFS was seen in one (P ¼ .10).21 In pediatric T-
ALL, one study identified an improved early response to
therapy (P , .01), decreased early (FBXW7 and/or NOTCH1)
and late MRD (NOTCH1, P , .01), and improved EFS
(NOTCH1; P ¼ .01). Patients with both NOTCH1 and
FBXW7 mutations had similar outcomes to those with
NOTCH1 mutations alone.334 The second pediatric study
showed improved early response to therapy with NOTCH1
and/or FBXW7 mutation but no difference in EFS or OS.324
JAK1 mutations were associated with reduced DFS (P ¼
.01) and OS (P , .01) in a small cohort of patients with T-
ALL,331 but no recommendation regarding JAK1 mutation
testing in T-ALL was made because of a lack of multiple or
larger studies confirming that report.

 data on NOTCH1 and FBXW7 mutations in patients with T-
ALL.
Public Comment Response for Statement 15.—There were
174 respondents, 90.8% (n ¼ 158) of whom agreed, and
9.2% (n¼16) who disagreed with the statement. There were
32 written comments, most of which were very supportive,
but some of which expressed that the panel was too limited,
others questioning its clinical utility, and others suggesting
the inclusion of copy number aberrations and genetic
abnormalities characterizing Ph-like ALL be added.
Statement 16.—Strong Recommendation for Testing for
FLT3-ITD; Recommendation for Testing for Other Mutational
Analysis.—For pediatric and adult patients with suspected or
confirmed AML of any type, the pathologist or treating
clinician should ensure that testing for FLT3-ITD is
performed. The pathologist or treating clinician may order
mutational analysis that includes, but is not limited to,
IDH1, IDH2, TET2, WT1, DNMT3A, and/or TP53 for
prognostic and/or therapeutic purposes.
The strength of evidence was adequate to support this
guideline statement.
The recommendation for FLT3-ITD testing was supported
by 13 PCSs‡‡‡‡ that met the inclusion criteria for our SR and
8 other studies26,343–349 that were found external to our
systematic search (or did not meet the inclusion criteria) but
were retained for discussion. Of the 13 studies, one was
deemed to have a low risk of bias,342 10 were deemed to
have a low to moderate risk of bias,§§§§ and 2 were deemed
to have a moderate risk of bias.14,294 None of these studies
were found to have methodological flaws that would raise
concerns about the studies’ findings. Refer to Supplemental
Table 15 for the quality-assessment results of studies
included on FLT3-ITD testing.
The discovery of gene mutations that affect prognosis in
AML was a major advance of the past decade, and the
more-recent use of NGS techniques has increased access to
mutation panels in the diagnostic setting. Although the
prognostic significance of gene mutations were first
recognized in patients with normal karyotype AML (NK-
AML), it is now recognized that some mutations may define
specific disease-classification groups, such as AML with
mutated NPM1, AML with biallelic mutations of CEBPA,
and the provisional entity of AML with mutated RUNX1,
whereas others, such as FLT3, may provide prognostic
information across different classification groups.8 Muta-
tions in FLT3 most commonly result in ITDs but may also be
point mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain. Many gene
mutations are now, however, reported in AML,7,349 creating
challenges in understanding which individual genes and/or
gene combinations are significant in the disease and warrant
testing. Although NGS panels may allow for routine study
of multiple genes, the literature review tended to focus on
the significance of individual genes. It is understood that,
with more study, stronger recommendations for genetic
testing in AML may be appropriate in the near future.
Mutations in FLT3-ITD are now recognized as predictors
of a poor prognosis in AML, especially in NK-AML. Most
patient cohort studies have found a worse DFS or OS in
patients with this mutation, although differences in CR are
not always present.***** Similar findings are found in
young adult patients with AML and cytogenetic abnormal-
ities, including t(15;17)(q24.1;q21.2), t(8;21)(q22;q22.1), and
t(6;9)(p23;q34.1), as well as mutations of NPM1 and
CEBPA.100,349 Fewer studies have failed to find mutations
of FLT3-ITD to be associated with prognosis, and the
significance may be less in pediatric AML.122,298,338–340 The
mutation level was also directly associated with worse
survival,26,342,343 including 2 patient cohort studies, and the
level of mutation should be investigated in cases with a
mutation detected.
Refer to Table 10 for study data on NPM1, FLT3-ITD,
CEBPA, KIT, and RUNX1 testing.
The recommendation for testing of other mutations in
AML is supported by 21 studies,††††† comprising one SR
based meta-analysis,353 3 NRCTs,10,11,354 and 17 PCSs.‡‡‡‡‡
The meta-analysis, reported by Zhou et al353 was deemed to
have a low risk of bias. The 3 NRCTs10,11,354 were all deemed
to have a low to moderate risk of bias. For the 17 PCSs, 3
were deemed to have a low risk of bias,30,101,119 13 were
deemed to have a low to moderate risk of bias,§§§§§ and one

 combined the results of IDH1 and IDH2 mutations. Three
PCSs340,351,352 found IDH1 mutation to be associated with a
worse prognosis in patients with AML, who have interme-
diate-risk cytogenetics or NK-AML, but one of those
studies351 also combined the results of both IDH1 and
IDH2 mutations for analysis. Three PCSs found no
prognostic significance to detecting this mutation in adult
AML.15,119,338 A single PCS of pediatric AML did not detect
the R132 mutation in any cases.338 One PCS of the IDH1
single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs11554137 found
the presence of that SNP to be associated with a worse OS.15
For mutations in IDH2 in adult AML, most studies
combined the results of the R140 and R172 mutations, and
some combined IDH2 results with those of IDH1. One
meta-analysis353 found improved OS, but no effect on EFS
in AML with mutated IDH2. Two NRCTs10,354 and 2
PCSs351,352 found a worse prognosis with that mutation,
although the worse prognosis was only associated with the
R172 mutation in one study.352 Two PCSs119,340 found no
prognostic significance to the presence of an IDH2 mutation
in AML, and one352 found no prognostic significance when
the R140 mutation was present in AML.
One NRCT and one PCS studied the prognostic
significance of tet methylcytosine dioxygenase 2 (TET2)
mutations in AML. The NRCT354 found no prognostic
significance to the detection of that mutation, whereas the
PCS101 found TET2 mutations to be associated with a worse
outcome.
Mutations of Wilms tumor 1 (WT1), usually involving
exons 7 and 9, were evaluated in 12 studies and found to be
associated with a significantly worse prognosis in AML,
usually in NK-AML, in 8 of the 12 studies—one NRCT10 and
7 PCSs,******—and was not prognostically significant in
the other 4 PCSs.29,109,119,120 One positive PCS was in
pediatric patients.195
The prognostic significance of detecting the WT1 SNP
rs16754 was evaluated in one NRCT11 and 3 PCSs15,29,119 and
was found to be significantly associated with an improved
prognosis in all studies.
One PCS in adult AML evaluated the prognostic
significance of DNA methyltransferase 3 alpha (DNMT3A)
mutations in AML and found mutations to be significantly
associated with a worse OS and EFS.130
No studies were identified with the search parameters of
the SR evaluating additional sex combs like 1, transcrip-
tional regulator (ASXL1), mutations in AML, although a
recent study found a worse OS in patients with AML with
myelodysplasia-related changes (AML-MRC), and ASXL1
mutations compared with patients with AML-MRC and no
such mutation (P ¼ .01).355 Future studies may clarify the
significance of that gene mutation in AML.
Two PCSs evaluated the prognostic significance of
KMT2A (MLL)-PTD (partial tandem duplication) mutations
in AML. One found that mutation to be associated with a
worse progression-free survival,109 and one found no
significance to that mutation on OS in NK-AML.119
One PCS evaluated the prognostic significance of
neuroblastoma RAS viral oncogene homolog (NRAS)
mutations in NK-AML and found no effect on OS.119
Additional studies on mutations in DNMT3A, usually
R882, show variable results, with some also showing such
mutations associated with shorter remission and surviv-
al,356,357 whereas others showed no effect on remission or
survival duration.357,358 Mutations may be associated with a
worse outcome in younger adults (younger than 60
years),130,358 but one study suggests worse DFS and OS in
older adults with the R882 mutation.356
Mutations in tumor protein p53 (TP53) were highly
associated with complex karyotypes and other myelodys-
plasia-related cytogenetic abnormalities that involve chro-
mosomes 5, 7, and 17.359–361 Such cases were either therapy-
related AML or AML-MRC, but the mutations may be
germline. TP53 mutations are associated with worse RFS,
EFS, and OS. However, the effect of that mutation may not
be significant, with complex karyotypes defined as 5 or more
abnormalities.360

Public Comment Response for Statement 16.—There were
172 respondents, 65.7% (n¼113) of whom agreed, 1.74% (n
¼ 3) who disagreed, and 32.56% (n ¼ 56) who did not
commit but responded with written comments to the initial
draft statement. The comments included suggestions to
include more mutation analysis as well as suggestions that
fewer mutation studies should be listed. Some confusion
arose from the omission of mutation studies for NPM1 and
CEBPA in this statement, but those studies were recom-
mended in statement 19. Some respondents suggested
restricting that statement only to NK-AML, and others
wanted to expand testing to a large NGS panel for all AML
cases. Several objected to the listing of specific protein
expression assays that were included in the original
statement because such tests were not widely available,
and others suggested adding testing for other proteins.
Those comments were considered in the final draft of
statement 16 in this article.
Statement 17.—Strong Recommendation for Testing for KIT
Mutation in Adult Patients With CBF-AML; Expert Consensus
Opinion for Testing for KIT Mutation in Pediatric Patients With
CBF AML.—For adult patients with confirmed CBF-AML—
AML with t(8;21)(q22;q22.1); RUNX1-RUNX1T1 or
inv(16)(p13.1q22)/t(16;16)(p13.1;q22); CBFB-MYH11—the
pathologist or treating clinician should ensure that an
appropriate mutational analysis for KIT is performed. For
pediatric patients with confirmed CBF-AML—AML with
t(8;21)(q22;q22.1); RUNX1-RUNX1T1 or inv(16)(p13.1q22)/
t(16;16)(p13.1;q22); CBFB-MYH11—the pathologist or treat-
ing clinician may ensure that appropriate mutational
analysis for KIT is performed.
The strength of evidence was adequate to support testing
for KIT in adult patients with CBF-AML, but insufficient to
support testing for KIT in pediatric patients with CBF-AML.
This recommendation was supported by 2 PCSs298,339
obtained from our SR. The risk of bias assessment for both
was low to moderate. Overall, none of the studies providing
the evidence base for statement 17 were found to have
methodological flaws that would raise concerns about the
studies’ findings. Refer to Supplemental Table 17 for the
quality-assessment results for the studies included for
statement 17.
This recommendation for adult patients is evidence based
and is supported by multiple cohort studies outside of our
SR. Core-binding factor AML is a distinct cytogenetic
subtype of AML that is characterized by the presence of
t(8;21)(q22;q22.1) RUNX1-RUNX1T1 or inv(16)(p13.1q22)/
t(16;16)(p13.1;q22) CBFB-MYH11 and, in general, is con-
sidered a favorable risk.156,162 However, KIT mutations were

 identified in approximately 20% to 30% of CBF-
AML298,362,363 and are associated with increased recurrence
risk and decreased survival. In adults, available data
supported an adverse prognostic effect from KIT mutations
in CBF-AML.362–364 In one study of 33 patients,364 the few
patients (n ¼ 8; 24.2%) with t(8;21) and a KIT mutation had
a significantly lower EFS (244 days versus 744 days); that
difference was not seen in patients with NK-AML. A similar
result was seen in a larger study of 110 adult patients with
CBF-AML enrolled in multiple RCTs.363 In AML with
inversion 16, the KIT mutation was associated with a
greater 5-year cumulative incidence of relapse (56% versus
29%; P ¼ .05) and a worse OS when adjusted for sex (P ¼
.01), compared with cases without the KIT mutation. In
AML with t(8;21), the KIT mutation was associated with
increased 5-year cumulative incidence of relapse (70%
versus 36%; P¼.02), but there was no statistically significant
difference in OS. A third, larger study362 of 354 patients with
CBF-AML also showed a higher incidence of relapse among
the 99 patients with KIT mutations, but further showed that
effect was only significant in multivariate analysis if it was
limited to those patients with higher levels of the mutation.
The prognostic effect of KIT mutations in pediatric CBF-
AML is more controversial. One study met inclusion criteria
in our SR.339 In that retrospective study of 203 pediatric
patients with CBF amassed from several different trials, 38
showed KIT mutations, but there was no difference in the 5-
year EFS between patients with and those without KIT
mutations, either when they were looked at as a whole or
when they were divided separately into those with t(8;21) or
inv(16) leukemia. In contrast, a separate pediatric study from
the external review of t(8;21) AML showed 94.7% DFS for
the 38 patients without KIT mutations compared with 37.5%
for the 8 patients with the mutations (P � .001).365
Significant differences in 4-year OS were also observed
between patients with the KIT mutation (50.0%) and those
without KIT mutation (97.4%; P ¼ .001). The outcome of the
KIT� t(8;21) patients in this study was much better than the
59% 5-year EFS reported in the larger CBF study, suggesting
that the prognostic significance may be different in the
context of different therapies. KIT was not prognostic in a
separate pediatric AML study reviewed in the external
review, which did not look separately at patients with CBF
leukemia.366
One study from our SR included both pediatric and adult
CBF AML.298 For combined adult/pediatric patients with
AML and t(8;21)(q22;q22.1); RUNX1-RUNXT1, this study
showed no significant association of KIT mutation and
outcome (P¼not significant [NS] for relapse rate [P¼.39] or
OS [P ¼ .58]), although with a trend for inferior OS in
patients with the KIT mutation (P ¼ .14). For combined
adult/pediatric patients with AML and inv(16)(p13.1q22)/
t(16;16)(p13.1;q22); CBFB-MYH11, this study showed no
significant association of the KIT mutation with relapse rate
(P ¼ .41) or OS (P ¼ .70).298
Based on those findings, the EP concluded that KIT
mutation testing should be performed in cases of confirmed
CBF leukemia for further prognostication of this AML
category. The evidence is strongest in adult patients, but
there are data to suggest a negative prognostic effect in the
pediatric population.
Public Comment Response to Statement 17.—There were 173
respondents, with 84.39% (n ¼ 146) who agreed, 3.47% (n ¼
6) who disagreed, and 12.14% (n ¼ 21) who wrote
comments. There was strong support for the recommenda-
tion, especially for the adult population. The prognostic
significance of the KIT mutation in the pediatric AML was
felt to be more controversial, and after review of the
comments, the recommendation to test in the pediatric
population was changed from should to may. Some felt that
this testing should be performed only in patients in whom it
affects clinical management or those who are transplant
candidates. The public comments were taken into consid-
ered in the final draft of statement 17 in this article.
Statement 18.—Strong Recommendation.—For patients
with suspected APL, the pathologist or treating physician
should also ensure that rapid detection of PML-RARA is
performed. The treating physician should also order
appropriate coagulation studies to evaluate for disseminated
intravascular coagulation (DIC).
APL is defined by the presence of PML-RARA rearrange-
ment. Because APL is treated differently from other AML
subtypes, rapid diagnosis of this type of AML is critical.
Although no evidence from our SR informs this statement,
evidence external to our SR indicates that conventional
karyotyping should be performed in all patients with
suspected APL, but the testing may miss rare, cryptic
PML-RARA rearrangements.367 Reverse transcription PCR
for PML-RARA can rapidly confirm a diagnosis of APL, even
in patients who are leukopenic and in those with
cytogenetically cryptic PML-RARA rearrangements.367–369
Interphase FISH studies using dual-fusion probes for PML
and RARA can also be used to confirm the rearrangement.370
Immunofluorescence staining methods for PML protein can
rapidly confirm the presence of PML-RARA rearrangement
because of the differential nuclear distribution of the PML
protein in APL, but that staining is not widely available and
may miss variant RARA translocations.367,371,372 The body of
evidence supports a strong recommendation for the use of a
rapid-detection method to confirm PML-RARA rearrange-
ment in APL; the determination of which of the several
alternate methods to use should be made by each individual
laboratory.
Patients with APL are at high risk for DIC, which can be
evaluated by coagulation studies. No evidence from our SR
informed this statement. Evidence outside our SR indicates
that compared with other AML subtypes, APL is more often
associated with DIC, has more fibrin degradation products,
higher D-dimer levels, and lower fibrinogen levels.373 In
patients with APL, a prolonged prothrombin time has been
associated with greater risk of clinical bleeding374 and a high
International Society of Thrombosis and Hemostasis (Carr-
boro, North Carolina) DIC score (based on platelet count,
D-dimer level, prothrombin time, and fibrinogen level)375
has been associated with a greater risk of fatal bleeding
events.376 Based on that evidence, a strong recommendation
was made to perform coagulation testing in patients with
suspected APL.
Public Comment Response to Statement 18.—There were 172
respondents, of whom, 89% (n ¼ 154) agreed, 1.74% (n ¼ 3)
disagreed, and 8.72% (n ¼ 14) wrote comments, among
which were a more-precise definition of rapid and the
preferred methodology for detection of PML-RARA rear-
rangement. The comments were considered in the final draft
of statement 18 in this article.
Statement 19.—Strong Recommendation.—For patients
other than those with confirmed CBF-AML, APL, or
AML-MRC cytogenetic abnormalities, the pathologist or
treating clinician should ensure that mutational analysis for
NPM1, CEBPA, and RUNX1 is performed.

 The strength of evidence was adequate to support this
guideline statement.
This statement was supported by 2 PCSs100,339 that met
the inclusion criteria for our SR. Both of those studies were
deemed to have a low to moderate risk of bias. Neither of
the studies was found to have methodological flaws that
would raise concerns about their findings. Refer to

Acute myeloid leukemia with mutated NPM1 defines a
specific and unique category of AML under the WHO
classification.132 Mutations in NPM1, a nucleocytoplasmic
shuttling protein, are the most-common mutations in adult
AML, occurring in 27% to 35% of cases.377,378 Frameshift
mutations in exon 12 (chromosome band 5q35) result in an
elongated protein that is retained in the cytoplasm.377 Those
mutations are most frequent in NK-AML (45%–60%),377–379
and occur only rarely in association with the recurrent

 cytogenetic abnormalities that define CBF-AML—AML
with t(8;21) or inv(16)/t(16;16)—or APL.377,378,380,381 This
was supported by 2 studies from our SR, for both adult
(Gaidzik et al100 reported P , .05 incidence of NPM1
mutations compared with other AML subtypes) and
pediatric patients (Pollard et al339 reported 0% incidence of
NPM1 and CEBPA mutations). Cytogenetic abnormalities
associated with NPM1 mutations are most frequently single
genetic abnormalities (ie, þ8, þ4, �Y, del(9q), þ21)378,382 and
are only rarely associated with a complex karyotype (P ,
.001).378 These mutations are less frequent in childhood
AML (6.5%–8%) but occur primarily in pediatric cases with
NK-AML (22%–27.1%).383–385
The favorable prognostic effect of the NPM1 mutation has
been shown in multiple cohort studies and is strongest
when combined with a lack of the FLT3-ITD mutation. In
NK-AML, the NPM1 mutation alone is associated, in some
studies, with improved CR (P , .03) without significant
effect on OS.378,380 However, when evaluated in context of
the FLT3 mutation, the NPM1 mutation in the absence of
the FLT3 mutation is associated with significantly higher OS
(P , .03),378–380 DFS (P , .04),378 EFS (P¼.01),380 and RFS (P

 NPM1 mutation in the absence of FLT3-ITD mutation (n ¼
13) was associated with a trend toward a favorable 5-year
EFS (P ¼ .51).383 Within the FLT3� subset, the NPM1
mutation was shown to have similar outcome to t(8;21) and
inversion 16 AML. In a second cohort study, NPM1
mutation was associated with favorable EFS (P ¼ .02 overall;
P ¼ .01 in NK-AML).385 FLT3 did not appear to affect
outcome, but analysis was limited by small numbers (n ¼ 10
of 25 patients with the NPM1 mutation). The favorable
prognostic effect of the NPM1 mutation was not altered by
an aberrant, non-MDS karyotype382 or by multilineage
dysplasia386 in de novo AML. The AML with mutated
CEBPA also defined a specific and unique category of AML
under the WHO classification, but classification under that
category is now restricted to cases with biallelic muta-
tion.8,132 CEBPA mutations have also been associated with a
favorable prognosis in AML. CEBPA belongs to the CCAAT/
enhancer binding protein family of transcription factors, is
expressed exclusively by myelomonocytic cells, and is
upregulated in granulocyte differentiation.387
Mutations in CEBPA are reported in 10% to 15% of
patients with AML, and the most frequent mutations
include either N-terminal frameshift mutations or C-
terminal in-frame insertions/deletions.388,389
Three mutational patterns have been identified: single-
mutated (involving one allele), double-mutated (typically
biallelic), and homozygous CEBPA mutation because of a
loss of heterozygosity.390,391 These mutations occur most
frequently in NK-AML (70%) and less frequently in AML
with intermediate risk (most frequently trisomy 8) or
unfavorable cytogenetic abnormalities.392 These mutations
do not occur with favorable, recurrent cytogenetic abnor-
malities—t(15;17);PML-RARA, t(16;16) or inv(16); CBFB-
MYH11, or t(8;21); RUNX1-RUNX1T1.389 FLT3-ITD and
NPM1 mutations rarely occur in combination with biallelic-
mutated CEBPA.392
The favorable prognosis associated with CEBPA mutations
has been shown in multiple cohort studies and is confined
to biallelic-mutated CEBPA. In a prospective, multicenter
clinical trial of 135 patients with AML, the presence of a
CEBPA mutation (single or biallelic mutated) compared with
wild-type CEBPA was associated with longer OS (P ¼ .04),
EFS (P ¼ .04), and DFS (P ¼ .05).393 A second prospective
trial of 224 patients with AML demonstrated that the
favorable prognostic significance of CEBPA mutation was
confined to cases that were biallelic mutations.115 Biallelic
CEBPA mutations were associated with improved OS (P ¼
.01) and DFS (P ¼ .01) compared with a single CEBPA
mutation. There was no difference in OS or DFS in AML
with a single CEBPA mutation when compared with wild-
type CEBPA. These findings were further supported by a
large, multicenter study, which included 2296 patients with
AML enrolled in 2 large, prospective clinical trials.392
Biallelic CEBPA mutations, but not single CEBPA mutations,
were verified as an independent favorable prognostic factor.
When compared with single-mutated and wild-type CEBPA,
biallelic-mutated CEBPA was associated with improved OS
(P , .001 and P , .002) and longer EFS (P ¼ .008 and P ¼
.012). There was no difference in outcome between NK-
AML and AML with intermediate-risk cytogenetic abnor-
mality for both biallelic CEBPA mutations and single CEBPA
mutations.
One NRCT10 and one RCS100 evaluated the prognostic
significance of RUNX1 mutations in AML and both found
worse OS and EFS in patients with that mutation. Unlike
NPM1 and CEBPA mutations, mutations of RUNX1 were
relatively commonly associated with MDS-related cytoge-
netic abnormalities or prior therapy, features that continue
to take precedence over the RUNX1 mutation for disease
classification. Based on those studies, the EP recommends
testing for NPM1, CEBPA, and RUNX1 mutations in AML
other than APL, CBF-AML, or AML with MRC cytogenetic
abnormalities. Cases meeting criteria for AML-MRC based
on multilineage dysplasia alone should also be tested. In
addition to defining specific categories of AML under the
WHO classification, mutations of NPM1 and biallelic
mutations of CEBPA were associated with a favorable risk.
The favorable prognosis for NPM1 mutation was confined to
cases that lacked FLT3-ITD and, for CEBPA, to the group
with biallelic mutations.
Public Comment Response to Statement 19.—There were 172
respondents, of whom 75.58% (n ¼ 130) agreed, and 4.07%
(n ¼ 7) disagreed. However, 20.35% (n ¼ 35) of the
respondents provided a range of comments. Most of the
comments referred to the necessity of evaluating NPM1 and
CEBPA mutations in the context of the FLT3 mutation,
which was addressed in the discussion and in statement 16.
Several respondents suggested restriction of those markers
for NK-AML or FLT3-ITD� AML. Those comments were
addressed in the discussion and were considered in the final
draft of statement 19 for this article.
Statement 20.—No Recommendation.—For patients with
confirmed AL, no recommendation is made for or against
the use of global/gene-specific methylation, miRNA expres-
sion, or gene expression analysis for diagnosis or prognosis.
The strength of evidence was insufficient to support this
guideline statement.
This statement was supported by 10 studies,†††††† com-
prising 2 NRCTs11,131 and 8 PCSs.‡‡‡‡‡‡ Both of the
nonrandomized studies were deemed to have a low to
moderate risk of bias assessment. For the PCSs, the risk of
bias assessments ranged from low24,30,101,193,395 to low to
moderate.34,127,394 None of those studies were found to have
methodological flaws that would raise concerns about the
studies’ findings. Refer to Supplemental Table 19 for the
quality-assessment results of studies included for statement
20.
The interplay between mutational analysis and gene
expression profiling in predicting prognosis is an area of
ongoing research, especially in patients with cytogenetically
normal AML. Although protein and gene-expression
profiling studies for ERG, BAALC, or MECOM/EVI1 have
reported prognostic significance for outcome in some
studies, overall, independent, prognostic significance may
not be present when mutational analysis is integrated into
multivariate analyses.11 Often, the prognostically significant
effect of deregulated expression of a specific gene was most
apparent in highly selected patient cohorts, such as patients
older than 70 years with cytogenetically normal AML.131 In
AML with KMT2A (MLL)-rearrangement, overexpression of
MECOM/EVI1 is associated with an inferior prognosis (P ¼
.01 for OS).396 In one study, a 24-gene prognostic signature
independently predicted OS and EFS in AML (P , .001).397
In studies outside our SR, low global DNA methylation
(as assayed by a luminometric methylation assay) was
associated with favorable outcome in non-APL de novo

 AML, independent of karyotype risk and NPM1, FLT3, and
CEBPA mutation status.398 High methylation of polycomb
target genes was associated with better progression-free
survival and OS in cytogenetically normal AML.399 Within
our SR, 2 studies were identified for gene-specific methyl-
ation, one finding no significant prognostic effect of BMP/
retinoic acid inducible neural specific 1 (BRINP1/DBC1)
methylation in AML394 and one of which found that
methylation status of any of 9 specific genes adversely
affected OS in ALL (P , .05).34
In our SR, 5 studies found a significant effect of miRNA
expression levels on outcome in adult AML (P ,
.05),24,30,127,193,395 including one in which miRNA expression
patterns were correlated with expression of other prognostic
markers,127 whereas one study found no significant effect on
outcome.101 One study found significant association of
miRNA with OS in adult and pediatric ALL (P , .05).34
Overall, many studies identified both within, and outside
of, our SR indicated that deregulated gene expression,
miRNA expression, and global as well as gene-specific
methylation may affect outcome in AL. However, much of
the data are relatively recent; moreover, those studies are
not currently standard clinical laboratory tests, even in
reference laboratories. Thus, no recommendation was made
for, or against, those specialized tests at the time of AL
diagnosis. With technological advances, it is possible that
these specialized studies will become more widespread in
clinical practice, similar to the current standardized assess-
ment for mutations in key leukemia-associated genes
recommended in statements 15, 16, and 19.
Refer to Supplemental Table 4 for study data on global/
gene-specific methylation, miRNA expression, and gene
expression analysis.
Public Comment Response to Statement 20.—There were 162
respondents, of whom, 58.64% (n ¼ 95) agreed, and 11.11%
(n ¼ 18) who disagreed. However, 30.25% (n ¼ 49) provided
written comments, which indicated they thought the clinical
utility of gene expression, miRNA expression, and global/
gene-specific methylation studies currently have limited
clinical utility and that the studies were not widely available
for clinical use. Those comments were considered in the
final draft of statement 20 in this article.
Statement 21.—Strong Recommendation.—For patients
with confirmed MPAL, the pathologist or treating clinician
should ensure that testing for t(9;22)(q34.1;q11.2); BCR-
ABL1, and KMT2A (MLL) translocations is performed.
Although one study from our SR informed this recom-
mendation,140 the guideline statement is evidence based and
supported by 2 additional studies outside our SR.400,401
Mixed-phenotype acute leukemia is associated with a
variety of cytogenetic abnormalities, among which, are
included t(9;22)(q34.1;q11.2); BCR-ABL1 and KMT2A (MLL)
translocations.140,02 Those cytogenetic abnormalities are
associated with distinctive features and define specific
entities under the WHO classification: MPAL with t(9;22);
BCR-ABL1 (Phþ) and MPAL with t(v;11q23.3); KMT2A
(MLL) rearranged.132
In studies using 2008 WHO criteria for MPAL,
t(9;22)(q34.1;q11.2) was identified in 15% to 20% of cases,
and KMT2A rearrangement in 4% to 8% of cases.140,403
With the advent of TKIs, it has become important to
recognize the BCR-ABL1 fusion in cases of AL. Three studies
were identified that specifically addressed the question of
the outcome of MPAL with t(9;22)(q34.1;q11.2) (Phþ).
Overall, those patients have a poorer outcome and, in the
preimatinib era, had the worst prognosis of any cytogenetic
group in MPAL.140 In one small (nonrandomized) series of
21 patients with adult MPAL, the poor general outcome was
confirmed, and patients receiving imatinib fared better with
a 1-year OS of 43% in the imatinib group compared with no
survivors in the chemotherapy-alone group.400 In a different
series, which compared the outcome of 42 patients with Phþ
AL treated with imatinib-containing regimens, the 5-year
OS and DFS of the 13 patients with MPAL was no different
from that of the patients with Phþ ALL, suggesting that
imatinib therapy improved the outcome of the patients with
Phþ MPAL and should be considered the standard of care.401
Similarly, KMT2A (MLL) rearrangement was associated
with reduced survival.404
Based on those data, the EP recommends testing for
t(9;22)(q34.1;q11.2); BCR-ABL1 and KMT2A (MLL) translo-
cations in MPAL.
Public Comment Response to Statement 21.—There were 174
respondents, 89.66% (n ¼ 156) of whom agreed, 1.15% (n ¼
2) who disagreed, and 9.2% (n ¼ 16) who wrote comments.
In response to the comments, language regarding the
specific methodology to test for these rearrangements was
removed from the final draft of statement 21 in this article.
Statement 22.—Strong Recommendation.—All laboratory
testing performed for the initial workup and diagnosis of a
patient with AL must be performed in a laboratory that is in
compliance with regulatory and/or accreditation require-
ments.
The strength of evidence was insufficient to support this
guideline statement, but its justification seems intuitive
because laboratory testing occurs in a highly regulated
environment. No evidence-based data were available from
our SR.
This guideline statement was based on expert consensus
opinion and codifies the importance of good laboratory
practices in patient care. In the United States, clinical
laboratory testing is regulated under CLIA ’88, as admin-
istered by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services
(Baltimore, Maryland); the amendments were updated in
2003.405,406 Certain medical devices and laboratory tests used
in an evaluation for AL have been approved and are
regulated by the US Food and Drug Administration,
whereas others have been developed by, and are performed
within, accredited laboratories (laboratory-developed tests).
It is important to ensure that laboratory-developed tests
have been appropriately validated and performance charac-
teristics established before being used in patient care. The
penalties for regulatory noncompliance are significant and
can include loss of laboratory director responsibilities for 2
years, monetary fines, closure of the laboratory, and inability
to receive Medicare reimbursement. The EP included this
guideline statement to ensure that tests performed in
research laboratories (eg, in the United States, non-CLIA–
approved laboratories) would not be used for patient care or
be included in the medical record.
Public Comment Response to Statement 22.—There were 172
respondents, 97.67% (n ¼ 168) agreed, and 2.33% (n ¼ 4)
who disagreed. There were 5 comments that were generally
supportive, although they raised the question of an
emergency situation that might arise outside of the
availability of an accredited laboratory. The final draft
statement in this document was modified to apply to
national and international situations by not specifying
individual regulatory and/or accrediting agencies. It is the
Arch Pathol Lab Med
Initial Diagnostic Workup of Acute Leukemia—Arber et al
37
 laboratory director’s responsibility to be aware of applicable
regulations.407
Statement 23.—Strong Recommendation.—If, after exam-
ination of a PB specimen, it is determined that the patient
will require immediate referral to another institution with
expertise in the management of AL for treatment, the initial
institution should, whenever possible, defer invasive proce-
dures, including BM aspiration and biopsies, to the
treatment center to avoid duplicate procedures, associated
patient discomfort, and additional costs.
The strength of evidence was adequate to support this
guideline statement.
This statement was supported by 28 studies,§§§§§§ com-
prising 2 meta-analyses,408,410 one RCT,414 2 NRCTs,106,112
and 23 PCSs.******* For the 2 meta-analyses, both were
deemed to have a low to moderate risk of bias. One trial, an
RCT reported by Vance et al414 was deemed to have a
moderate to high risk of bias. For the 2 NRCTs,106,112 the trial
by Moorman et al106 was deemed to have a moderate risk of
bias. The trial reported by Aric`
o et al112 was deemed to have
a low to moderate risk of bias. For the PCSs, 3 were deemed
to have a low risk of bias,101,102,194 14 were deemed to have a
low to moderate risk of bias,††††††† and 6 were deemed to
have a moderate risk of bias.‡‡‡‡‡‡‡ None of those studies
were found to have methodological flaws that would raise
concerns about the studies’ findings. Refer to Supplemental
Table 20 for the quality-assessment results of studies
included for statement 23.
The level of expertise for the diagnosis and treatment of
AL varies, with some centers having experience in virtually
all case types, and some never treating such patients. In
centers that do not routinely treat patients with AL and do
not offer most of the testing needed to make a compre-
hensive diagnosis of AL, it is recommended that the patient
be transferred to a treating center before the complete
diagnostic evaluation is performed. This helps to reduce
duplication of testing and the associated expense and
discomfort that occur with such testing. It is recognized
that some centers may determine that transfer of care is
appropriate only after a complete diagnostic workup is
completed or will need to make a rapid diagnosis to initiate
therapy before transfer, such as in the diagnosis of APL with
PML-RARA, and this guideline statement should not
interfere with testing that is considered emergent before
transfer.
Review of diagnostic material for the diagnosis of AL
varies in the literature. At diagnosis, morphologic evaluation
is often performed and interpreted at the local in-
stitution,§§§§§§§ often, with review of slides in a central
laboratory or tertiary care center if part of a clinical
trial,25,411,415 or samples may be prepared and interpreted
at a central laboratory or tertiary care center,112,297,340,412,413
including any immunophenotypic or other studies required
for diagnosis.415 A discrepancy rate of 12% was reported
between local and central review of AML diagnoses.411 At
diagnosis, flow cytometry testing may be performed at the
primary institution, with results reviewed by a central
laboratory or tertiary care center if part of a clinical
trial,14,324,415 or flow cytometry may be performed and
interpreted at a central laboratory.297,413 At diagnosis,
cytogenetic testing may be performed and karyotypes
interpreted at the primary institution********; cytogenetics
may be performed, but karyotype images be reviewed at a
central laboratory or tertiary care center,†††††††† or all
cytogenetic testing and interpretation may be performed at
a central laboratory or a tertiary care center.‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡ In one
study, 32% of AML and 38% of ALL karyotypes were
revised or rejected as inadequate upon central review of the
local karyotype images.179 Fluorescence in situ hybridization
studies as part of clinical trials were typically performed at a
central laboratory or tertiary care center.106,112,413,414 Molec-
ular studies confirming mutations and gene rearrangements
as part of clinical trials were typically performed at a central
laboratory or tertiary care center§§§§§§§§ as were DNA
methylation studies.196
If testing involves making specimens for routine or
cytochemical staining or performing flow cytometry on
BM at a central laboratory, the sample should be shipped
overnight and processed within 24 hours of being ob-
tained.112,297 For testing involving cytogenetics performed
centrally, overnight shipping of a heparinized BM sample is
recommended.23 Molecular genetic testing may be per-
formed on samples that are cryopreserved,194,324,411,412 with
some studies recommending the use of Trizol reagent
(Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, Massachusetts)194 and
storage of samples in liquid nitrogen,324,412 and others
recommending overnight shipping of sodium-citrate, anti-
coagulated samples for preparation of DNA (dry pellets
stored at �808C) or RNA (pellets in 4M guanidium
isothiocyanate stored at �208C).23 For DNA methylation
testing, BM samples should be shipped to the central
laboratory in heparinized tubes for processing within 24 to
36 hours of being obtained, should be frozen immediately
upon receipt (2–10 million cells), and should be stored at
�708C.196
Public Comment Response for Statement 23.—There were
171 respondents, of whom, 91.81% (n ¼ 157) agreed, and
8.19% (n ¼ 14) disagreed. Despite the support for the initial
draft of this statement, there were 32 written comments that
raised several patient concerns. Most of those concerns
related to delays in transfer of patients or the inability to
obtain acceptance for transfer without a complete diagnosis.
In addition, the need for a rapid diagnosis of APL was raised
by several commenters. Based on those comments, the final
draft of statement 23 in this article was altered to clarify that
it applies to patients needing immediate transfer.
Refer to Supplemental Table 5 for study data informing
this statement.
Statement 24.—Strong Recommendation.—If a patient is
referred to another institution for treatment, the primary
institution should provide the treatment center with all
laboratory results, pathology slides, flow cytometry data,
cytogenetic information, and a list of pending tests at the
time of the referral. Pending test results should be
forwarded when they become available.

Arch Pathol Lab Med
Initial Diagnostic Workup of Acute Leukemia—Arber et al
 The strength of evidence was insufficient to support this
guideline statement.
This statement was supported by 2 PCSs179,411 that met
the inclusion criteria for our SR. The study by Barbaric et
al411 was deemed to have a low to moderate risk of bias, and
the study reported by Mrozek et al179 was deemed to have
moderate risk of bias. Neither of the studies was found to
have methodological flaws that would raise concerns about
their findings. Refer to Supplemental Table 21 for the
quality-assessment results of studies included for statement
24.
This guideline statement was based on expert consensus
opinion that knowledge of test results performed at the
primary institution is optimal to rapidly confirm a diagnosis
of AL and to allow more cost-effective management of the
patient at the referral institution. Morphologic, flow
cytometric, cytogenetic, and molecular genetic studies can
pose significant cost to the health care system, especially if
they are repeated without knowledge of the initial results.
Certain tests may not need to be repeated at the referral
institution if the information from the primary institution is
available for review in a timely manner, and the findings are
confirmed. We found no studies that compared interinsti-
tutional results; however, comparisons between local
institution and central review in the context of clinical trials
were available for morphologic and cytogenetic reviews,
and, as mentioned previously, indicated a discrepancy rate
of 12% between local and central review of AML
diagnoses,411 and in one study, 32% of AML and 38% of
ALL karyotypes were revised or rejected as inadequate upon
central review.179 These findings support the need for
confirming the results of diagnostic testing at the referral
institution, with repeat testing employed judiciously.
Public Comment Response to Statement 24.—There were 169
respondents, 98.22% (n ¼ 166) of whom agreed, and 1.78%
(n ¼ 3) who disagreed. There were 9 written comments.
Those comments generally dealt with logistical issues
regarding communication between the primary institution
and treatment center. However, as one respondent
indicated, ‘‘seems simple, but in the real world it is often
difficult.’’ In the era of shared medical records, these
procedures may become easier. The comments received
were considered and are reflected in the final draft of
statement 24 in this article.
Statement 25.—Strong Recommendation.—In the initial
report, the pathologist should include laboratory, morpho-
logic, immunophenotypic, and, if performed, cytochemical
data on which the diagnosis was based, along with a list of
any pending tests. The pathologist should issue addenda/
amended reports when the results of additional tests
become available.
Our SR provided no data to inform this statement.
However, the panel believed that the benefits of imple-
menting the recommendation vastly outweighed the harms
and thus designated this guideline statement with a strong
recommendation.
Both routine and more-specialized testing results must be
incorporated into initial and subsequent, integrated reports.
Because morphology, cytochemical stains, FCI, and immu-
nohistochemical stains are typically available within a day or
so after the BM has been obtained, the interpretation and
integration of those results should be included in the initial
reports.
Specialized testing is an integral component of AL
diagnosis and is required in virtually all cases of AL to
provide either diagnostic or prognostic information. In
addition, specialized tests may provide evidence to validate
the use of a specific type of targeted therapy for an
individual patient. Based on an assessment of the morpho-
logic and immunophenotypic features of the AL, genetic
testing must be performed in a cost-effective manner using
evidence based criteria. Conventional karyotyping is con-
sidered the standard of care for all cases of AL. In addition,
some molecular genetic tests are also considered to be
warranted in cases of AL meeting specific criteria as listed in
this clinical practice guideline.
Consolidating all routine and specialized test results into
an integrated consultation report is optimal for effective
communication with treating physicians and patients and
for optimal therapy.416 Because of the time delays inherent
in some molecular genetic testing, pathologists need to have
mechanisms to track pending test results. Those results
need to be integrated with morphologic and immunophe-
notypic data to enhance the original diagnosis, using current
WHO classification criteria, as well as to provide prognostic
information. Either an addendum format or, more optimal-
ly, an integrated, interpretive format is optimal.416
Public Comment Response to Statement 25.—There were 171
respondents, 94.15% (n ¼ 161) of whom agreed, and 5.85%
(n ¼ 10) who disagreed. Despite the overwhelming support
for this statement, several of the comments recognized the
difficulty of getting all the data into the electronic medical
record. Those comments were taken into account for the
final statement in this article.
Statement 26.—Strong Recommendation.—The pathologist
and treating clinician should coordinate and ensure that all
tests performed for classification, management, predicting
prognosis, and disease monitoring are entered into the
patient’s medical records.
Note.—This information should include the sample
source, adequacy, and collection information, as applicable.
Our SR provided no data related to this key question or
statement. The EP, however, strongly recommended that
all critical information related to the diagnosis and
prognosis of a patient with AL be available in the medical
record. Ideally, this would be summarized in a single
consolidated report.416 However, it is recognized that, in
some settings, not all information needed for pathologists
to generate such a report might be available because of
some testing being sent directly to other laboratories by the
treating physician. Therefore, all this information should be
either interfaced with, or scanned into, the medical record,
so that all the material needed for the determination of a
comprehensive diagnosis is present in the patient’s record.
It is recognized that improved and more-integrated
pathology information systems that directly interface with
the electronic medical record are needed to allow for
optimal patient care.
Public Comment Response for Statement 26.—There were
169 respondents, 99.41% (n ¼ 168) of whom agreed, and
0.59% (n ¼ 1) of whom disagreed. There were 8 written
comments, all of which endorsed this concept.
Statement 27.—Strong Recommendation.—Treating phy-
sicians and pathologists should use the current WHO
terminology for the final diagnosis and classification of
AL.
The strength of evidence was convincing to support this
guideline statement.

quality-assessment results for the studies included for

A review of the studies published in recent years shows
that various classification systems have been used for the
diagnosis and subclassification of AL. In AML, the
classification systems used included the FAB system,§§§§§§§§§
the WHO classification (2001 version),417,425 and the WHO
classification (2008 version),********** or more than one
classification system because of lengthy study peri-
ods.13,71,159,341,423 For studies that did not include a classifi-
cation system,31,127,129,419,421 cytogenetic-defining groups
were variably used. For acute B-ALL, most studies††††††††††
used the 2008 WHO classification system or a cytogenetic
classification system similar to the 2008 WHO system. The
National Cancer Institute (Frederick, Maryland) risk classi-
fication167 of ALL was used in conjunction with the
cytogenetic risk classification in some studies.19,20,295,330 The
FAB system alone was mostly used to describe morpholo-
gy.124 A few studies used immunophenotypic classification
only17,296,426 or no classification system at all.171,327 The T-
ALL classification was mainly based on immunophenotyp-
ing alone, including a system proposed by the European
Group for the Immunological Characterization of Leukemi-
as (Nancy, France).‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡
A uniform categorization of AL is essential to facilitate
understanding between health care workers and to provide
a framework for clinical practice, data comparison, epide-
miologic studies, and new genetic and molecular investiga-
tions. The WHO classification of neoplasms of the
hematopoietic and lymphoid tissues, published in 2001,425
and updated in 2008,5 with a new revision recently
summarized,8 represents a worldwide consensus on the
diagnosis of hematopoietic tumors. That classification
derives from numerous published clinical and scientific
studies and is the result of collaboration and consensus
among pathologists, cytogeneticists, and treating physicians.
The WHO classification attempts to incorporate the disease
characteristics that have been proven to have clinical and
biologic relevance into a useful working nomenclature. A
retrospective study of 5848 adult patients with AML showed
that the FAB morphologic subclassification did not provide
prognostic information if the specific genetic and morpho-
logic WHO categories and WHO provisional entities, such
as ‘‘AML with mutated NPM1’’ and ‘‘AML with mutated
CEBPA,’’ were included.428 The applicability of the WHO
classification in pediatric AML, on the other hand, may
require additional molecular genetic data for further disease
delineation.429 Nevertheless, since the first edition in 2001,
the WHO classification system has been adopted for
numerous studies, and its clinical practicality and reproduc-
ibility has been demonstrated in diverse international
settings. Treating physicians and pathologists should use
the most current WHO terminology for the diagnosis and
classification of AL, including adoption of the current
revision.
Public Comment Response to Statement 27.—There were 167
respondents, 98.8% (n ¼ 165) of whom agreed, and 1.2% (n
¼ 2) who disagreed. There were 11 written comments. Some
commented that the WHO classification of AL requires
cytogenetic and molecular data, which are often not
available at the time of diagnosis or before the initiation of
treatment. The other concern was that the WHO classifi-
cation system was not always up to date. Since the last
updates in 2008, numerous molecular genetic discoveries
have been published, some of which have been shown to
have a significant effect on the treatment and prognosis of
AL, and more discoveries will certainly be described after
the 2016 classification. Therefore, the final report should
incorporate those new data for the purposes of therapy and
prognosis. New technologies in molecular genetic discovery
are evolving quickly and provide new insights in disease
biology, thereby refining disease classifications and guiding
clinical practice. The panel acknowledged those comments,
which are reflected in the final statement in this article.
Refer to Table 12 for study data that informed this
guideline statement.
CONCLUSIONS
The 27 statements that comprise the ASH/CAP guideline
for the initial diagnostic workup of AL address the 6 key
questions initially proposed:
1. What clinical and laboratory information should be
available? (Statements 1 and 2.)
2. What samples and specimen types should be evaluated?
(Statements 3, 4, 7, 8, and 11.)
3. What tests are required for all patients during the initial
evaluation? (Statements 3, 5, 6, 9, and 12.)
4. What tests are required for only a subset of patients?
(Statements 10, 14, 13, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, and 21.)
5. Where should laboratory testing be performed? (State-
ments 22, 23, and 24.)
6. How should the results be reported? (Statements 25, 26,
and 27.)
As noted at the beginning of this article, the initial workup
and evaluation of AL has become increasingly complex
during the past decade, due, in part, to the availability of
new laboratory techniques—particularly genetic studies—
that have resulted in better characterization of AL and in
classification schemes with improved clinical and scientific
relevance. However, not only is the diagnosis and classifi-
cation of AL important but also of importance is the
identification of prognostic factors, antigens, or genetic
abnormalities that may be targets for specific therapy, and
markers that can be used to follow the response to therapy
and monitor residual disease. In addition, the workup must
be performed quickly, efficiently, and at a reasonable cost.
When all these factors are considered, along with the
realization that the recent revision of the 4th edition of the
WHO classification of AL has nearly 50 distinct subtypes of

Initial Diagnostic Workup of Acute Leukemia—Arber et al
 AL,8 the value of the guidelines described in this article and
their applicability for the workup of AL can be readily
appreciated.
Although many pathologists and clinicians will consider
the most crucial guidelines to be those indicated that relate
to specific tests necessary to make an accurate diagnosis and
to identify prognostic factors, the guidelines also highlight
recommendations for general and logistic considerations
that may be neglected in the urgency of the initial workup of
AL. For example, statement 1 emphasizes the value of the
patient’s history, particularly of any predisposing conditions
or syndromes, previous therapies, and any family history of
leukemia or other neoplasms. This latter recommendation is
important in view of the inclusion in the revised WHO
classification of the provisional entity myeloid neoplasms with
germline predisposition, which is likely more common than
currently recognized. In addition, recommendations are
made for preservation of cells and tissue from the initial
diagnostic specimen for any future studies that may be
relevant for prognosis or therapy (statement 7). For patients
who are transferred from one institution to another, the
guidelines recommend the avoidance of duplicate testing
and invasive procedures whenever possible (statement 23),
and the transfer of all test results and tests in progress, along
with the diagnostic specimens, to the receiving institution
(statement 24). The guidelines also indicate the central role
of the pathologist in issuing the diagnostic reports, and for
updating those reports as additional data are accumulated
(statements 25 and 26). Thus, the recommendations are
comprehensive in providing guidelines from the time a
patient suspected of having AL is first encountered until the
final diagnostic reports are generated.
The ASH and the CAP have cooperated in developing this
guideline. That joint effort underscores the cooperation that
is
necessary
between
the
treating
clinician
and
the
pathologist in the workup, diagnosis, and care of patients
presenting with a suspected diagnosis of AL.
