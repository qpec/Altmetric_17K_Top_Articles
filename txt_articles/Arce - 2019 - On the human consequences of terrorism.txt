Abstract
Terrorist attacks are regarded as low-probability, highly consequential events. What, 
exactly, are the significant effects of terrorism? This paper presents a cross-sectional depic-
tion of the death and injury profiles for nine of the most violent terrorism tactics: six types 
of bombings, mass shootings, combined shootings and explosions, and intentional vehic-
ular assaults. By constructing a composite injury and death profile for each tactic under 
study, terrorist incidents can be ranked in terms of the number of disability adjusted lives 
lost and disability adjusted life years lost. In addition, the human consequences of terror-
ism as a whole (on an annual basis) are placed in context relative to the global burden of 
disease and counterterror expenditures.

1 Introduction
Terrorist attacks are regarded as low-probability, highly consequential events. What, 
exactly, are the significant effects of terrorism and how are they measured? Terrorism is 
the use (or threat of use) of violence against civilians and inactive military personnel for 
the purpose of influencing an audience beyond the immediate victims in order to achieve 
political, ideological, or religious goals.1 The way that terrorism influences its intended 
audience generally is measured in terms of casualties, electoral consequences, amount of 
damage at the attack site, and its impact on economic growth and tourism.
Indeed, a general picture of the electoral consequences of terrorism is emerging from 
cross-country panel data studies. For example, Gassebner et al. (2008, 2011) analyze the 
relationship between terrorism and cabinet duration for more than 800 elections and 115

1 This definition is an umbrella meant to judiciously capture the definition of terrorism given in Enders 
and Sandler (2012, p. 4) and the definitions of terrorism used by the US Department of State and the US 
Department of Defense, as given in Enders and Sandler (2012, p. 6).

countries, constituting some 2400 cabinets in total. They find that terrorism increases the 
statistical likelihood of a cabinet change in the next election. Moreover, the likelihood is 
positively related to the number of severe events (involving at least one casualty) and the 
sum of all fatalities during a given year. Such studies examine the effects of domestic and 
transnational terrorism combined. Two additional cross-country studies focus on the politi-
cal effects of transnational terrorism alone. Williams et al. (2013) find that when trans-
national terrorism occurs, parliamentarian governments on the left of the political spec-
trum are more likely to fail than those on the right, and that the probability of government 
replacement rises with the total number killed in any given month. Park and Bali (2017) 
find that transnational terrorism destabilizes incumbents, with the effect being most pro-
found for autocracies.
By contrast, significant difficulties arise when gauging the consequences of terrorism in 
terms of monetary damages and its effect on economic growth. For example, in the Global 
Terrorism Database (hereafter, GTD), the value of property damaged by a recorded attack 
can be missing, indicating that an estimate of the damages was unavailable at the time 
of the coding of the attack, or recorded as “unknown” (START 2018). If recorded, the 
reported amount of damages can be quite coarse, e.g., indicating a value less than USD 1 
million. Approximately 99.5% of the terrorism incident entries in GTD leave the property 
damage associated with an attack blank, or list it as “unknown” or “minor” (likely less than 
USD 1 million).
Moreover, contrary to the conventional wisdom, it is not possible to infer that terror-
ism has a statistically significant effect on a country’s economic growth, owing to cross-
sectional interdependence between growth and terrorism with yet-to-be-identified common 
factors (Gries et al. 2011; Gaibulloev et al. 2014). Granted, some exceptional individual 
cases exist for which endemic terrorism has had an effect on the overall economy, such 
as Israel (Laroque et al. 2010), and others for which a particular region has experienced 
adverse effects, such as the Basque territory in Spain (Abadie and Gardeazabal 2003). 
With respect to industries, terrorism has an adverse effect on tourism that can spill across 
borders (Drakos and Kutan 2003). Nevertheless, findings regarding the adverse economic 
effects of terrorism within a particular region or economic sector do not imply that such 
findings will prevail for the economy as a whole. Indeed, once panel data estimates are cor-
rected for the fact that economic growth and terrorism are not sufficiently ‘distant’ in some 
social, economic, network, spatial, or other sense, Gaibulloev et al.’s (2014) findings con-
vincingly remove the economic growth-terrorism nexus from being considered as a highly 
consequential effect of terrorism.
Undoubtedly, casualties are what put the “terror” in terrorism. At the same time, very lit-
tle has been done to assess the human consequences of terrorism beyond counts of the num-
ber of deaths and, perhaps, injuries. Indeed, Spagat (2012) notes that, overall, the conflict 
literature focuses on deaths, likely because of their dramatic consequences, but that more 
effort needs to be made to measure injuries because they are, “arguably more policy-relevant 
than deaths, since injuries require ongoing treatment and other policy measures.” For exam-
ple, from 1970 to 2016, domestic and international terrorism combined resulted, on aver-
age, in 8338 deaths and 10,785 injuries per year (START 2018). Injuries outnumber deaths 
across the combination of domestic and transnational terrorist events recorded in GTD, and 
injuries far outnumber deaths for transnational terrorism alone by approximately a 3:1 ratio 
(Sandler et al. 2009). For the purposes of this study, measuring the ‘human consequences of 
terror’ involves (1) examining what lies beneath these casualty numbers, (2) characterizing 
how injuries and deaths are distributed according to the most violent tactics employed by 
terrorists, and (3) comparing and combining injuries and deaths on the same cardinal scale.

In this way, injuries are placed into context relative to deaths, and terrorism itself can be 
placed into context in terms of its associated casualties (deaths plus injuries). To contribute 
to reaching this goal, this paper provides the first cross-sectional depiction of terrorism that 
accounts for differences in the distribution of injuries across nine types of terrorist attacks: 
six types of bombings, mass shootings, combined shootings/explosions, and vehicular 
assaults.2 These nine tactics account for 80% of the deaths and 90% of the injuries in GTD. 
In addition, once this profile is created, it is possible to measure the human consequences 
for each type of tactic and for terrorism as a whole on an annual basis.
Deaths and injuries resulting from terrorism initially were placed in context by Sandler 
et al. (2009) as part of the Copenhagen Consensus project for prioritizing foreign aid. They 
used Abenhaim et al.’s (1992) study of the distribution of injuries and posttraumatic stress 
disorder resulting from 21 terrorist attacks in France between 1982 and 1987 (20 bombings 
and one machine gun attack) to construct a composite injury profile for a terrorist inci-
dent. By associating each type of injury with a disability weight from the Global Burden 
of Disease (Lopez et al. 2006), Sandler et al. (2009) created an injury profile that is com-
parable with deaths. This was possible because the disability weight associated with each 
injury takes a value in the [0, 1] interval, with a value of zero being commensurate with 
optimal health and a value of one corresponding to death. Injuries and deaths therefore are 
measured on a comparable scale. The product of the number of injured, the proportion of 
those injured that experience a particular injury, and the disability weight associated with 
the injury yields the total ‘injuries-as-deaths’ or ‘injuries-as-lives-lost’ associated with the 
injury. Aggregating this calculation over all associated injuries yields the total injuries-as-
deaths measure for the attack. In that way, Sandler et al. (2009) estimate that one terrorism 
injury equates to 0.57 of a death. Subsequently, the 0.57 composite disability weight has 
been used by Sandler et al. (2011), Enders and Olson (2012), Kaplan (2015), Arvanitidis 
et al. (2016), Hausken (2018) and Baron et al. (2017) to derive combined measures of ter-
rorism mortality and morbidity.
While novel, the limitations of the approach initiated by Sandler et al. (2009) are two-
fold. First, the injury profile is based on essentially one form of terrorist attack (bombings) 
and treats all bombings equally in terms of their injury profiles. Bombings comprise 48% 
of the incidents recorded in GTD. Until the present study, very little generally has been 
known about the effects of terrorism on its immediate victims across attack tactics. That 
gap is addressed by constructing composite injury and death profiles for six types of terror-
ist bombings (confined-space, open-space, suicide, vehicle-delivery, structural collapse and 
structural fire), mass shootings, combined shootings/explosions, and the relatively recent 
vehicular assaults in crowded areas. For bombings alone the casualty profile depends upon 
whether the attack takes place in an open or confined space. Given the number of injuries 
and deaths associated with a specific tactic, the composite disability weight can be used to 
determine the number of disability-adjusted lives lost (DALLs) associated with the attack. 
The DALLs can then be used to calculate the disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) lost 
to terrorist attacks. DALLs and DALYs are combined mortality and morbidity measures 
developed jointly by the World Bank and World Health Organization (hereafter, WHO) to 
measure the relative magnitude of healthy lives lost to a disease, injury or mental disorder. 
Combining the DALLs for the 10,785 yearly average injuries with the average of 8338 
lives lost to terrorism yields the (undiscounted) DALYs lost to terrorism.
2 Currently, injury profiles are unavailable for assassinations, hijackings, kidnappings, facility/infrastruc-
ture attacks, and unarmed assaults. Those tactics have relatively few casualties.

Second, a counterfactual exists that previously has gone unaddressed. Specifically, 
although a terrorist attack results in physical injuries and mental disorders, the inci-
dence of these sequelae in the absence of terrorism would not be zero among the sur-
vivors. On any given day, someone breaks an arm, experiences moderate hearing loss, 
gets burned, and so on, or becomes depressed or experiences a traumatic event that 
leads to posttraumatic stress disorder (hereafter, PTSD). Hence, one must also control 
for the incidences of injuries and disorders within the general population. For example, 
if the prevalence of major depressive disorder (hereafter, MDD) among the survivors of 
a terrorist attack is 25% (Salguero et al. 2001), and the yearly onset of MDD within the 
general population is 3.9% (ESEMeD/MHEDEA 2000 Investigators 2004); among ter-
rorism’s survivors an additional 21.1% (= 25 − 3.9) onset of MDD can be attributed to 
the attack. Note that only PTSD is included in the Sandler et al. (2009) study.
One contribution of the present paper is that it provides a picture of terrorism not 
previously available: a summary breakdown of the deaths and injuries associated with 
nine categories of attack tactics. In creating the first cross-sectional picture of terrorism-
related injuries by attack tactic, the paper identifies an additional dimension for assess-
ing different manifestations of political violence. For example, Conrad and Greene 
(2015) demonstrate that it is the quality of terror, rather than the quantity, that matters 
when assessing the “outbidding” theory of competition among terrorist groups. Their 
analysis is based on categorizing GTD incidents into two ordinal measures of attack 
quality. The first measure is target severity, with the ranking of severity running in 
increasing order from (1) infrastructure targets, to (2) combatants (military, police or 
rival terrorist groups), to (3) citizens, tourists, NGO personnel and the media. The sec-
ond measure is attack type. Again, in increasing order of severity these measures are (1) 
infrastructure and unarmed assaults, (2) hostage taking or hijackings, and (3) violent 
attacks, such as assassinations, armed assaults and bombings. The present analysis illus-
trates that even those attacks that would qualify as most severe by either ordinal meas-
ure differ substantially in terms of cardinal measures of their effects.
An analysis of the nine forms of terrorist attack tactics examined here leads to the 
following additional results. First, including injuries in the calculation of DALLs 
increases the human cost of terrorism by more than 50% compared to deaths alone. Sec-
ond, comparing DALLs across attack categories allows for a ranking of terrorist inci-
dents in terms of their human consequences. Mass shootings are found to be the most 
consequential form of attack, with combined shootings/explosions being second. Sui-
cide bombings come in third out of the nine tactics covered. That finding bolsters evi-
dence that suicide bombings receive disproportionate media coverage after adjusting for 
various characteristics of attacks, including the number of people killed (Jetter 2017). 
Third, the present study identifies why vehicular assaults should be of increasing con-
cern. Vehicular assaults are both logistically simple and have significantly higher injury 
and death profiles than many other forms of terrorism. Fourth, the human consequences 
of terrorism as a whole (on an annual basis) are placed in context relative to the global 
burden of disease and counterterror expenditures. For example, when the deaths and 
injuries associated with terrorism are aggregated across attack types, terrorism ranks 
in the bottom 9% of the disabilities, injuries, and disorders considered in the Global 
Burden of Disease (Murray et al. 2012). Terrorism thus is shown to be a low probability 
event with small consequences, as measured by its global burden. In that way, preexist-
ing work that is circumspect about the risk and effectiveness of terrorism (e.g., Abrahms 
2011; Wilson and Thompson 2005) is corroborated using entirely different data and 
methods for assessing the consequences of terrorism.

Data
This study considers only the direct human consequences of a terrorist attack. That is, 
those individuals who lost their lives, were injured, or experienced mental disorders owing 
to their physical presence at the site of the attack. Electronic witnesses of the event on tel-
evision, the internet, or by other means, and the effects on the relatives and households of 
the direct victims are not considered.
Understanding that caveat, the steps involved in combining terrorism injuries with 
deaths are as follows. First, identify the frequency of different types of injuries associated 
with different types of terrorist attacks. Second, map those injuries into the categories that 
receive disability weights (DWs) in the Global Burden of Disease (Salomon et al. 2015)—
hereafter, GBD. Third, identify the number of injuries associated with a given type of ter-
rorist attack. Fourth, combine steps one, two and three in order to arrive at the number of 
lives lost due to disability (LDs) associated with each terrorist tactic. Fifth, combine the 
LDs with the number of lives lost (LLs) associated with a given tactic to arrive at the num-
ber of disability adjusted lives lost (DALLs = LLs + LDs) for the tactic. Finally, given the 
life expectancy of terrorism victims, one can compute the DALYs lost for specific terrorist 
tactics as well as for terrorism as a whole. Consequently, data are needed on (1) the injury 
profile for each tactic, (2) the disability weight associated with each type of injury, (3) the 
number of injuries and deaths associated with each tactic, (4) the age profiles of victims, 
and (5) years of life expectancy lost to premature death or injury. In addition, in order to 
provide a counterfactual, the incidence of each type of injury within the general population 
is needed.
In summary, data are needed to calculate the following:
fi 
 
frequency of disability/injury/disorder ‘i,’ where 0 ≤ fi ≤ 1
DWi 
 
disability weight for disability/injury/disorder ‘i,’ where 0 ≤ DWi ≤ 1
LDi 
 
number of injuries-as-lives-lost to disability/injury/disorder ‘i.’
LD 
 
total injuries-as-lives-lost to a terrorist tactic (attack category)
LL 
 
total lives lost (deaths) to a terrorist tactic (attack category)
DALLs 
 
total disability adjusted lives lost to a terrorist tactic (DALL = LD + LL)
DALYs 
 
total disability adjusted life years lost to a terrorist tactic
In reality, data are exceedingly scarce on the breakdown of injuries resulting from par-
ticular types of terrorist attacks. In the major terrorism databases, often all that is recorded 
is the number of casualties (those killed or injured). Yet data on the associated frequency 
of injuries, fi’s, are needed to calculate DALLs and DALYs. A contribution of this paper is 
that it leverages data from multiple sources, typically, epidemiological meta- or multi-year 
studies of the injury profiles of different terrorist attack tactics. Those profile data are then 
used to make predictions on the breakdown of injuries by tactic, as, in general, this infor-
mation is not directly available. The data sources are discussed below, as are the nature of 
and sources for the disability weights.

organized as listed in Table 1 because bombing injuries fall into four categories (Edwards 
et al. 2016): primary blast pressured-induced (blast lung, tympanic membrane), secondary 
effects of projectiles (thorax, abdominal, head and neck, extremity, spine), tertiary (limb 
fracture, limb amputation), and quaternary (burns).
In addition, in examining Table 1 it is clear that, for a given tactic, the overall percent-
age of injuries sustained can sum to a total that is greater than 100%. That is because many 
victims sustain multiple injuries. Moreover, certain tactics lead to more multiple injuries 
than other tactics. For these reasons, the occurrence of multiple injuries is important infor-
mation that should not be arbitrarily ruled out by normalizing injury frequencies so that 
they sum to 100% for a given tactic. For example, survivors of vehicular assaults have, in 
general, been struck by the largest ‘projectile’—a vehicle—and sustain more multiple inju-
ries than any other form of terrorist tactic considered here. For vehicular assaults, the sum 
of the frequency of all injuries in column (7) of Table 1 is 274%. Multiple injuries clearly 
are a consequence of vehicular assaults. The method used for dealing with multiple injuries 
when calculating DALYs is addressed below.
Edwards et al. (2016) conduct a meta-study of the injury profiles of 167 terrorist bomb-
ings worldwide from 1970 to 2014. In so doing, they find significant differences in the 
injury profile for bombings taking place in open versus confined spaces. For example, the 
primary (pressure-induced) injuries associated with bombings increase within confined 
areas because of the effects of reflections or reverberations of the blast from walls or other 
structures (DePalma et al. 2005). By contrast, open-space bombings do not result in a great 
degree of primary blast injuries because the associated pressure dissipates in the absence 
of fixed boundaries. Such differences can be seen by comparing the primary blast data rows 
in columns (1) and (2) of Table 1. The injury profile for suicide bombings in column (3) 
comes from a different data source. Yasin et al. (2012) provide information from a 3-year 
study of 1296 multiple injuries from suicide bombing victims hospitalized in Rawalpindi, 
Pakistan. Their study is relied on because the injury categorization is comparable to that in 
Edwards et al. (2016). Suicide bombings differ significantly from conventional bombings 
in terms of both their mortality and injury profiles (Hicks et al. 2011; Santifort-Jordan and 
Sandler 2014).
Comprehensive accounts of injuries sustained in terrorist mass shootings are given in 
Peleg et al. (2004), Sheffy et al. (2006) and Turner et al. (2016). Turner et al. (2016) is 
a meta-study of 17 mass casualty shootings worldwide during 1980–2016. Their study is 
not restricted to terrorist incidents, whereas Peleg et al. (2004) and Sheffy et al. (2006) 
are studies of terrorism-related mass shootings in Israel. Only the Israeli studies include 
information on the types of injuries sustained, with the injury classifications in Sheffy et al. 
(2006) being the most comparable to the other analyses herein. Sheffy et al.’s (2006) data, 
which covers 2000–2004 and 553 victims, are given in the fourth column of Table 1. Inter-
estingly, the overall death rate of 33.3% in Sheffy et al. (2006) is exactly that given for 
mass-casualty shootings in Turner et al. (2016).
Incidents during which terrorists used a combination of firearms and explosives in a 
public place include the 60-h 2009 attack in Mumbai and the Paris concert area attack of 
November 2015. Malik et al. (2009) provide injury data for an attack within a mosque in 
Quetta, Pakistan on 4 July 2004 with 94 victims in which 78.5% of the injuries resulted 
from gunshot wounds and the remaining 21.5% from explosives. Given that the injury cat-
egories in Malik et al. (2009) are comparable in detail to the other studies employed here, 
their data are used for attacks that combine gunshots and explosives. See columns (5) and 
(6) of Table 1. Note that the numbers actually are below the casualty counts for the attacks 
in Mumbai (Bhandarwar et al. 2012) or Paris (Gregory et al. 2016).

Finally, during 2016–2017, a rash of vehicular assaults occurred in which a terrorist 
intentionally drove a moving vehicle into an area crowded with pedestrians, such as a mar-
ket or bridge. Unfortunately, Israel has had significant prior experiences with that specific 
tactic. In particular, Almogy et al. (2016) provide injury data for 29 intentional vehicular 
assaults in Jerusalem from October 2008 to May 2016. Assaults by driven vehicles inflict 
the greatest number of multiple injuries on survivors, as detailed in column (7) of Table 1.
2.2  
Mental disorders
In addition to physical injuries, survivors of terrorist attacks are known to experience men-
tal disorders such as PTSD and MDD. PTSD occurs at about double the rate in survivors of 
terrorist attacks than in survivors of motor vehicle accidents (Shalev and Freedman 2005). 
In their meta-study of 113 articles on the behavioral consequences of terrorism worldwide, 
DiMaggio and Galea (2006) find that an average of 18% of terror survivors experience 
PTSD. Salguero et al.’s (2011) meta-study of 736 direct terror victims finds that 25% expe-
rience MDD. Those proportions are assumed to hold across all columns/types of terrorist 
attacks in Table 1, with the exception of mass shootings [column (4)]. For that column, 
the findings reported in Stene et al. (2016) for the survivors of the mass shooting in Utøya, 
Norway on 22 July 2011 are used. Their figures are 7.7% for PTSD and 24.5% for MDD. 
All of the data for PTSD and MDD apply to persistence of the disorder for at least 1 year 
following the attack.
2.3  
Disability weights
In order to compare injuries with lives lost, each injury category in Table 1 requires a dis-
ability weight (DW). For each injury, ‘i,’ DWi ∊ [0, 1]. That method allows injuries and 
lives lost to be expressed in a comparable cardinal scale. For example, hearing loss often is 
associated with bombings. In Table 2, the row labeled “tympanic membrane” gives the dis-
ability weight associated with moderate hearing loss as 0.027 and that for profound hearing 
loss as 0.204. The health state of an individual is 1 − DWi. Consequently, an individual 
with profound hearing loss experiences 1 − 0.204 = 76.9% of optimal health, whereas one 
with moderate hearing loss experiences 1 − 0.027 = 97.3% of optimal health. Disability 
weights are regarded to be constant across countries for a given injury/disease/disorder.
First determined in 1990 by the World Bank and WHO, the values of disability weights 
are obtained from a panel of judges and are meant to reflect the relative desirability of a 
health state for a given clinical description of a disability, injury, or disorder (Haagsma 
et al. 2014). Choice-based methods that panelists use to assess health states include stand-
ard gamble and time tradeoff (Brazier et al. 2017). An assessment for the panel as a whole 
is derived from statistical analyses of individual panelist’s responses. In the standard gam-
ble, a panelist is given a choice between (a) living in the health state associated with ‘i,’ for 
the last h years of his or her life, or (b) submitting to a medical procedure that will be fully 
restorative for those h years but carries a probability, pi, of immediate death. Various trade-
off exercises involving different values of pi are presented in order to assist a panelist in 
selecting a value of pi that induces indifference between options (a) and (b). A time tradeoff 
elicitation process facilitates the panelists’ identification of the number of years of perfect 
health, yi, that would make them indifferent to h years in health state ‘i,’ where yi < h. In 
addition, methods exist for distinguishing panelists’ confounding factors, such as risk aver-
sion from pi, and rate of time preference from yi.

Finally, health state values are rescaled to lie between 0 and 1 and turned into the asso-
ciated disability weight. The disability weight is calculated as 1—health state value, spe-
cifically for standard gamble, DWi = pi, and for time tradeoff, DWi = 1 − yi/h. It is important 
to keep in mind that one cannot simply invert those formulas in order to arrive at an alter-
native tradeoff-based interpretation of the disability weight in terms of pi or yi. As they are 
not measured in terms of epidemiological data (such as incidence or prevalence), disability 
weights are a means to an end. In this study, the disability weights are used in combination 
with the frequency of a particular disability/injury/disorder for a terrorist tactic in order to 
arrive at summary measures of the associated health consequences (DALLs and DALYs). 
These in turn will be used to measure the human consequences of terrorism.
Unfortunately, many of the injuries in Table 1 do not have an exactly corresponding 
disability category in GBD. For that reason a range of minimum and maximum values for 
each injury is considered, as detailed in Table 2. The ranges for the number of lives lost 
owing to disability (LDs) for different types of terrorist attacks are calculated by using the 
minimum disability weights given in Table 2 and then again by using the maximum dis-
ability weights in the same table. In that way, a range of LDs is calculated for each tactic. 
In addition, at present GBD does not contain disability weights for PTSD. The PTSD dis-
ability weights derived in Charlson et al. (2016) and Haagsma et al. (2011a) are used for 
the minimum and maximum values, respectively.
2.4  
Casualties
The deaths and injuries for each tactic are presented in the upper section (first two rows) of 
Table 3. Arnould et al. (2004) report median deaths and injuries for six different types of 
bombings using worldwide data covering 43 events. They are the data entered in the first 
two rows of columns (1)–(6). The sources for deaths and injuries in columns (7)–(9) have 
been discussed above. Note that the Arnould et al. (2004) bombing study is for mass-cas-
ualty events involving 30 or more casualties; hence, it is a study of ‘spectaculars’ and that 
feature must be kept in mind. At the same time, the bombings are being compared to data 
for mass shootings and combined shootings/explosions, both of which are mass casualty 
tactics, by definition. A comparison is therefore being made across spectacular versions 
of those tactics.3 The first two rows of Table 3 must therefore be understood as an upper-
bound estimate of the human consequences of terrorism.
In comparing the categories it is easy to see that suicide bombings cause more casual-
ties than any other type of bombing. By comparison, mass shootings and combined gun-
shot/explosion attacks cause more casualties than suicide bombings. Combined attacks are 
logistically complex; therefore, they are inherently designed to produce mass casualties.

Lives lost to terrorism injuries
The imputed number of lives lost to disability/injury/disorder ‘i’,  
LDi, is calculated as follows. 
Given the associated disability weight, DWi, and number of individuals with the sequela, Ni, 
 
LDi = DWi*Ni. For specific terror events, the number of individuals with a particular sequela, 
Ni, generally is not known. Instead, what is known is the total number of injured, N, and the

frequency of a particular sequela, fi, provided for the first time in Table 1. Consequently, 
Ni = fi*N. It follows that  
LDi = DWi*fi*N.
Many terror survivors experience multiple injuries. Two primary methods are avail-
able for addressing comorbidity across injuries (Mathers et al. 2006; Haagsma et al. 2011b). 
One method is to assume that the total disability weight is the sum of the separate disability 
weights. For the additive method, DWi+j = DWi + DWj. An alternative approach is to realize 
that the health state of an individual experiencing sequela ‘i’ is 1 − DWi. If one assumes that 
experiencing combined sequela is more severe than experiencing either on its own, this is akin 
to the health state values, 1 − DWi and 1 − DWj being multiplicative. Hence, the associated 
disability weight for the multiplicative method is DWi*j = 1 − (1 − DWi)*(1 − DWj). The mul-
tiplicative method has the advantage that it is always the case that DWi*j ∊ [0, 1], whereas for 
the additive method it is possible that DWi+j > 1 (death). This contingency is addressed below.
Given the total number of types of injuries, I, associated with a particular tactic, the aggre-
gate LD for the tactic when using the additive method is:
For any given tactic, the associated LD will vary with the number of injured, N. Hence, 
what is common for calculating the lives lost to disability for a specific tactic is the term 
∑i∊IDWi * fi. That term defines the composite disability weight, DW+, for a given tactic when 
using the additive method to account for comorbidity. Consequently, if the number of injuries 
for a given terrorist attack is known and the tactic is one of the nine types analyzed here, then 
the composite disability weight provided by this study can be used to determine the LD for 
the attack. Such an example is given below for the 2016–2017 spate of intentional vehicular 
assaults.
Disability weights for individual injuries fall in the [0, 1] interval. By definition, the fre-
quency values for a specific injury ‘i’, fi, also lie within the same interval. However, owing 
to the presence of multiple injuries, it is possible that the sum ∑i∊Ifi > 1. For example, for 
vehicular assaults the sum of the injury frequencies is 2.74, meaning that it is also theoretically 
possible for the composite disability weight to be greater than one. Yet it must be the case that 
the composite disability weight takes a value that is less than or equal to one because a value 
of one corresponds to death. Consequently, when using the additive method, if the composite 
disability weight for an attack type exceeds one, I reduce the disability weight to a value of 
one. In this study there is one and only one instance of that phenomenon: the composite dis-
ability weight for vehicular assaults when the maximum disability weight is used for each type 
of injury (see Table 3).
A composite disability weight can alternatively be calculated by applying the multiplicative 
method to the disability weights for each injury. Specifically,

where ∏ is the product operator. The composite disability weight using the multipli-
cative method to account for comorbidity is denoted as DW*. It is always the case that 
0 ≤ DW * ≤ 1.
A comparison of composite disability weights for the additive and multiplicative comor-
bidity methods is given in the appendix (Table 8) for different types of terrorist attacks. 
When the minimum disability weights for injuries are used, the two methods are quite 
close, with an average absolute difference of 0.0090 across the attack types. For the maxi-
mum disability weights, they are further apart, with an average absolute difference of 
0.1809. Given that Haagsma et al. (2011b) find that the interclass correlation coefficient 
between observed and predicted comorbidity disability is highest for the additive approach, 
the additive composite disability weight, DW+, will be used in all calculations from this 
point forward.
Finally, in calculating LD no adjustment is made for duration of injury because LD 
already is biased downward for several reasons. First, the injury frequencies reported in the 
studies cited in Table 1 are only for those survivors who were hospitalized. The number of 
injured and their injuries therefore are both undercounted. Second, it is known that large 
numbers of non-victims suffer psychologically in the aftermath of a terrorist event. In a 
meta-study of that phenomenon, Salguero et al. (2001) find that the risk of MDD in non-
victims after a terrorist attack lies between 4 and 10% for the adult population where the 
event occurred. Lastly, Kerridge et al. (2012) find evidence that terrorism can have nega-
tive effects on public health beyond sequela experienced by the immediate victims and that 
effect is not accounted for.4
It follows that, given the number of lives lost, LL, the number of disability adjusted 
lives directly lost in a terrorist event is:
The difference between DALLs and DALYs is that no adjustment has yet been made for 
the years of life expectancy lost by the terrorism victims, Y. Given Y, the (undiscounted) 
years lived with disability, YLD, is YLD = LL*Y and the (undiscounted) years of life lost 
due to death, YLL, is YLL = LL*Y. The formula for (undiscounted) disability adjusted life 
years, DALY = YLL + YLD, can therefore be expressed as
Finally, the counterfactual to an injury associated with a terrorist event is not no injury. 
Many of the injuries—and especially the mental disorders—observed following terrorist 
incidents also occur in the population at large. As such, one has to consider the frequency 
of injury ‘i’ within the population (per 100 persons), ̂
fi 
. Consequently, the counterfactual 
net frequency of injury ‘i’ is fi − ̂
fi 
. Given this counterfactual, the net lives lost to disability 
‘i’ are
The frequency of an injury per 100 persons, ̂
fi, can be extremely low. In order to avoid 
scientific notation, injury frequencies are commonly reported on a per 10,000 or 100,000 
person basis. For example, ̂
fi is zero for primary blast injuries because, “bombs and explo-
sions cause unique patterns rarely seen outside of combat” (CDC 2016). By contrast, the

onset of mental disorders within the general population during a 12-month period is sub-
stantial. The ESEMeD/MHEDEA 2000 Investigators (2004) put the 12-month onset of 
MDD at 3.9% for adult Europeans and for PTSD they put it at 0.9%. The implication is 
that if 25% of the survivors of a terrorist bombing experience MDD, this actually is a net 
increase of 21.1% 
(fi − ̂
fi = 25 − 3.9) that can be attributed to the terrorist event. Similarly, 
the 18% who experience PTSD represent an attributable net increase of 17.1% (= 18 − 0.9). 
The data for the counterfactual calculations are given as an appendix (Table 9).

Results
The casualties for nine different types of terrorist attacks are displayed in the first two 
rows of columns (1)–(9) of Table 3. Examining those two rows alone makes it clear that 
attack tactics vary substantially in terms of both the distribution and numbers of deaths and 
injuries.
4.1  
Composite disability weights for terror attacks
The middle section of Table 3 begins with the composite disability weights, where the term 
‘composite’ means that the disability weight is an aggregation of the frequency of injuries 
sustained for a given type of terrorist attack. At this point, no attempt is made to control for 
the counterfactual, which is the frequency of the injuries in the general population in the 
absence of terrorism. In calculating the composite disability weight, either the minimum 
disability weight values for all injuries are used or the maximum disability weight values 
are used (refer to Table 2). For example, as measured by the composite disability weight, 
each injury sustained in a confined-space bombing ranges between 0.0895 and 0.5414 of 
a life lost. The finding of one injury equating to 0.57 of a life lost by Sandler et al. (2009) 
falls just outside that range but it does fall within the range of 0.1061–0.6391 of a life 
lost for open-space bombings. Suicide bombings cause injuries that range between 0.1419 
and 0.9759 of a life lost [column (3)]. The composite disability weight in column (7) for 
mass shootings ranges between 0.113 of a life lost to 0.631. For attacks that combine gun-
shots/explosives, the range for disability weights is 0.1562–0.4909. Intentional vehicular 
assaults, which have become increasingly popular with Islamic State-inspired terrorists, 
lead to injuries that range from 0.2531 to 1.0 of a life lost.
When the composite disability weight is multiplied by the number of injuries, the result 
is the number of lives lost due to disability. This is then added to the number of lives lost to 
determine the number of DALLs for a given type of terrorist attack. By comparing DALLs 
one can see that, on average, the form of terrorist attack with the greatest human conse-
quences is mass shooting, with a DALL of 100.76. The second-most consequential form 
of terrorism is an attack that combines shootings/explosions (DALL = 59.50). Mass shoot-
ings are twice as consequential as suicide bombings (DALL = 50.30), which is the third 
highest form of attack analyzed here. The lower ranking of suicide bombings should not 
be surprising given Jetter’s (2017) recent findings that, (1) “suicide attacks receive more 
media coverage purely for being suicide attacks,” even when controlling for deaths, and 
(2) in terms of media coverage, a suicide attack is equivalent to an alternative attack that 
generates 95 deaths. Hence, suicide attacks should not be expected to be at the top of the 
DALLs ranking because the suicide aspect substitutes for casualties as a means of gaining 
media attention.

4.2  
Controlling for the counterfactual
The bottom section of Table 3 controls for the counterfactual that, in the absence of a 
terrorist event, some of the victims would still have experienced an injury or mental dis-
order. On average, the effect of this counterfactual is to reduce the composite disability 
weight for conventional bombings by 15%, suicide bombings by 12.7%, mass shootings 
by 26.4%, attacks that combine shootings/explosions by 18.95%, and vehicular assaults 
by 13.7%. Controlling for this counterfactual has a qualitatively significant impact on 
the composite disability weights.
4.3  
Application to vehicular assaults
The methodology introduced above can be used to assess the recent rash of vehicle 
assaults, as indicated in Table 4. “Following the (vehicular assault) attack in Nice that 
killed 86 people in July 2016, the Islamic State published a guide for would-be attack-
ers, noting that vehicles are ‘extremely easy to acquire’ and unlikely to arouse the sus-
picions of citizens or authorities” (Clarke and Klarevas 2017). That characterization of 
vehicular assaults is more in line with the spectacular nature of the casualties given for 
the first eight tactics in Table 3. The recent vehicular assaults have a median DALL 
of 36.71, making them the fourth-most consequential form of terror attack relative to 
the DALL calculations in Table 3. Given the logistical ease of intentional vehicular 
assaults, and their associated consequences when conducted at the scale currently expe-
rienced, this is likely a harbinger of the future of terrorism.
5  
The human consequences of terrorism in context
The purpose of DALYs is to provide a summary measure of the relative burden 
(healthy life years lost) for different diseases, bodily injuries and mental disorders. The 
data and methodology introduced above allow for a determination of the burden of a 
terrorist attack, as measured by DALYs. Undiscounted DALYs are equal to the prod-
uct of disability adjusted life years and the years of life expectancy lost by the victims: 
DALY = DALL*Y. The value used for years of life expectancy lost, Y, is the number of 
years of life expectancy lost for the median or mean age of terror victims. Once again, a 
range of values is considered. Specifically, in Stene et al. (2016) the mean age of the vic-
tims of the Utøya mass shooting was approximately 19 years old. Almogy et al. (2016) 
report a mean age of 24.7 for vehicular assaults in Israel. For the Oklahoma City bomb-
ing in the United States, Mallonee et al. (1996) give a median age of 39. In addition, for 
an attack to be truly representative of the civilian population, it is assumed that 50% of 
the victims are female. Life expectancy data for each country come from the World Bank.
The DALY ranges for individual types of attack are given in Table 5. The injury coun-
terfactual is not applied there, as DALYs are most often presented without accounting for 
the counterfactual, and the DALYs for terrorism will be compared with those associated 
with other phenomena. The DALYs for an individual type of attack range from 368 to 
6348 years. As is the case for DALLs, the form of terrorist attack with the largest DALY 
is mass shootings, followed by combined shootings/explosions, suicide bombings and the 
recent spate of intentional vehicular assaults.

The global burden of terrorism
In order to estimate the burden of terrorism for a particular year, consider the follow-
ing exercise. Using the GTD dataset, 8338 terrorism-related deaths occur per year 
(1970–2016). In addition, 10,785 terrorism-related injuries occur annually. These totals 
are given in the final column of Table 6. As Table 6 is comparing aggregates, rather than 
individual tactics, the deaths and injury data come from GTD rather than from the first 
two rows of Tables 3 or 5. Deaths and injuries are allocated to each tactic according to 
a normalized percentage of total deaths and injuries within GTD among the nine tactics. 
For example, suicide bombings constitute 16.86% of the deaths within the nine types of 
attack examined herein, and 22.53% of the injuries. Combined shootings/explosions con-
stitute 15.47% of the deaths and 9.5% of the injuries; vehicular assaults constitute 1.04% of 
the deaths and 3.39% of the injuries. GTD distinguishes between suicide and non-suicide 
bombings, but does not further refine bombings into closed-space, open-space, vehicle 
delivery and structural collapse categories. Hence, non-suicide bombings, which constitute 
23.64% of the deaths and 52.23% of the injuries, are assumed to fall uniformly across those 
four tactics (5.91% of the deaths and 13.06% of the injuries each).
The results of this exercise are presented in Table 6. By accounting for injuries, the annual 
average of 8338 lives lost to terrorism is increased to 12,628 disability adjusted lives lost. 
That represents a 51% increase in the measured number of lives lost to terrorism annually. 
By contrast, the annual DALYs for terrorism as a whole range from 502,056 to 798,984, 
with a median value of 726,695. That number is an extremely low health burden for disease. 
If terrorism were a disease, injury, or mental disorder, its DALY would rank in the bottom 
decile of the 291 diseases and injuries included in the Global Burden of Disease (Murray 
et al. 2012). Specifically, in Table 7 it is shown that terrorism would rank 266th, i.e., in the 
bottom 9%. Relative to the diseases that plague mankind, terrorism has limited consequences.
5.2  
The counterterror context
Counterterror expenditures ultimately are designed to save lives and this study quantifies 
the casualties attributable to terrorism. Moreover, recall that Gaibulloev et al. (2014) use a 
panel dataset to show that it is unlikely that terrorism has a significant effect on economic 
growth. In addition, the data on damages is so coarse that 99.5% of the entries in GTD pro-
vide no specific property damage figures, with 76% of the total listed as “unknown” or left 
blank. Hence, the immediate consequences of terrorism primarily are human, consistent 
with the focus of this paper.
Consider, therefore, the following calculation. The September 11th Victim Compensa-
tion Fund was tasked with determining compensation for the families of the people killed 
by the events of 9/11. The average award for a death claim ended up being approximately $2 
million (Feinberg 2006). During the same period, US public spending on homeland secu-
rity alone rose from $20.1 billion per year in 2001 to $54.3 billion per year in 2005 (Hobijn 
and Sager 2007). Taking $2 million per life as a benchmark, those figures work out to 
federal money spent to save roughly 27,000 lives per year (≈ $54.3/$2 m).5 The calculation 
is consistent with the following well-known statement contained in the 911 Commission 
Report (US Congress 2002): “terrorists need to be successful only once to kill Americans 
5 GTD does not provide data on foiled attempts or plots because an “attack must actually be attempted to 
qualify for inclusion in the database” (START 2018).

and demonstrate the inherent vulnerabilities they face.” By contrast, a total of 12,628 dis-
ability adjusted lives are lost to terrorism annually worldwide, of which but a fraction are 
US citizens, implying a benefit–cost ratio no greater than 0.47 (= 12,628/27,000). Granted, 
disability weights and DALYs have been designed with allocative efficiency of health 
interventions in mind, but this level of inefficiency does give one pause as to the underlying 
rationale for counterterrorism expenditures.

Conclusion
This paper provides the first cross-sectional picture of the human consequences of terror-
ism by type of attack tactic. In particular, it presents the injury and mental disorder profiles 
for nine types of terrorist attacks: confined-space bombings, open-space bombings, sui-
cide bombings, vehicle delivered bombings, structural collapses due to bombings, struc-
tural fires due to bombings, mass shootings, attacks that combine shootings/explosions and 
vehicular assaults. The tactics found to be responsible for the most casualties, as meas-
ured by disability adjusted lives lost, are mass shootings, followed by combined shootings/
explosions, suicide bombings, and the recent phenomenon of vehicular assaults.
The rankings presented herein are possible because composite disability weights are 
also derived for each type of attack, which facilitates getting past counts of the numbers 
of deaths and injuries alone, presenting a clearer picture of the human consequences of 
terrorism. Examining terrorism through the lens of casualties (deaths + injuries) leads to

a different ranking of terror tactics than ranking by deaths alone. In addition, the ability to 
combine deaths and injuries into one useful measure prevents injuries from being viewed 
as separate from or incomparable to deaths, thereby providing a comprehensive overall 
portrait of the effects of terrorism on its victims. For example, instead of observing 8388 
deaths and 10,785 terrorism-related injuries annually due to terrorism, it is now possible to 
state that there are 12,682 disability-adjusted lives lost annually to terrorism. This is a 51% 
increase in the average number of deaths attributed to terrorism absent the injury count. It 
also removes ambiguity regarding how to place injuries in context.
At the same time, the impact of terrorism is placed into context against two standards. 
For a representative year, the median number of disability adjusted life years lost to ter-
rorism is 486,378. That is, terrorism lies in the bottom 9% of the global burden of disease. 
Similarly, it is shown that the benefit–cost ratio for DHS counterterror expenditures can be 
no greater than 0.47.
That calculation suggests that a significant portion of counterterror expenditure is non-
instrumental, i.e., a public spending rationale that includes something other than its effect 
on terrorists. For example, cross-country panel analyses suggest that terrorism increases 
the statistical likelihood of cabinet changes in parliamentary governments, implying that 
counterterror policy has a role to play as a form of organizational and/or coalitional main-
tenance for those currently holding power. Indeed, Coates et al. (2006) show that the dis-
tribution of DHS funds among US states can be partly explained by the electoral votes 
per capita of a state, rather than being more directly tied to each state’s vulnerability to 
terrorism. Research is therefore needed into the fundamental tension between the instru-
mental and political goals of counterterror policy. In this sense, counterterror policy’s ends 
may not differ substantially from those of terrorism itself, which also has non-instrumental 
rationales geared towards maintaining terrorist organizations.
Finally, the data and techniques presented herein allow for a much more thorough treat-
ment of the effects of terrorism injuries beyond their use as count data. The injury profile 
data assembled herewith can better prepare emergency rooms for the types of injuries likely 
to be admitted in the immediate aftermath of a given type of terrorist attack. In addition, 
the cost of injuries has been expressed in terms of deaths. An alternative measure would be 
the cost of treatment, which presumably differs for blast lung injuries versus broken femurs 
versus major depressive disorders, etc. Moreover, it is much more likely that the degree to 
which terrorism acts as system stressor, such as on public health, is explained by the diver-
sion of resources to the injured, rather than to those killed, because the treatment and care 
of the injured is ongoing, and is not limited to healthcare professionals.
