While cell-based immunotherapy, especially chimeric antigen re-
ceptor (CAR)-expressing T cells, is becoming a paradigm-shifting
therapeutic approach for cancer treatment, there is a lack of general
methods to remotely and noninvasively regulate genetics in live
mammalian cells and animals for cancer immunotherapy within
confined local tissue space. To address this limitation, we have
identified a mechanically sensitive Piezo1 ion channel (mechanosen-
sor) that is activatable by ultrasound stimulation and integrated it
with engineered genetic circuits (genetic transducer) in live HEK293T
cells to convert the ultrasound-activated Piezo1 into transcriptional
activities. We have further engineered the Jurkat T-cell line and
primary T cells (peripheral blood mononuclear cells) to remotely
sense the ultrasound wave and transduce it into transcriptional
activation for the CAR expression to recognize and eradicate target
tumor cells. This approach is modular and can be extended for
remote-controlled activation of different cell types with high
spatiotemporal precision for therapeutic applications.

ith the use of central memory T cells capable of suppressing
cancer relapse for several years (1), chimeric antigen re-
ceptor (CAR) T-cell immunotherapy is transforming cancer
therapy (2). However, major challenges remain for CAR-based
immunotherapy against solid tumors. For example, the non-
specific targeting of the CAR T cells against normal/nonmalignant
tissues (on-target but off-tumor toxicities) can be life-threatening
(3). There is hence an urgent need for the control of CAR T-cell
activation with high spatiotemporal precision.
Existing methods to control genetic activities typically rely on
chemical inducers (e.g., dimerizers), radio waves, and magnetic or
light activation (e.g., optogenetics). Chemical inducers, radio
waves, and magnetic fields typically lack spatial resolution, with
radio and magnetic waves mostly requiring the signal amplification
and transmission by nanoparticles (or particle aggregates) to
stimulate genetically engineered cells (4–7). Although light acti-
vation or optogenetics can enable a precise control of genetic
regulation in space and time, it cannot reach deep tissues (8). In
contrast, ultrasound and its associated energy can be safely and
noninvasively delivered into small volumes of tissue deep inside the
body with high spatiotemporal resolution (9, 10). In fact, high
frequency ultrasound (HFU) can be focused for mechanical stim-
ulation of single cells at a subcellular region of less than 10 μm
(11). Microbubbles, which have been well established as ultrasound
imaging contrast agents and approved by the Food and Drug
Administration for clinical use (12), can further amplify the impact
of low-frequency ultrasound stimulation with the capability of long-
distance penetration of cells physically coupled to microbubbles, as
a result of a large difference in acoustic impedance between the
surrounding media and the air inside the bubbles (13–15).
We have developed a modular method to engineer cells that can
sense ultrasound stimulation applied remotely and noninvasively
to control genetics and CAR protein expression for recognizing
antigens to kill the target tumor cells. This method utilizes the
Piezo1 ion channel as a mechanical sensor (Fig. 1A), which has
been identified as a component of mechanically activated (MA)
cation channels (16) and is inherently mechanosensitive (17). The
ultrasound stimulation of Piezo1 and the consequent calcium
influx can activate calcium-sensitive phosphatase calcineurin to
dephosphorylate a transcription factor, the nuclear factor of
activated T-cells (NFAT), which can then translocate to the
nucleus for the activation of a NFAT response element (RE) to
drive the expression of designed target genes (18).
Results
We first examined whether ultrasound-induced mechanical stim-
ulation can activate the Piezo1 channel to elicit calcium influx.
HEK293T cells cotransfected with Piezo1-tdTomato and the
D3cpv FRET calcium biosensor were examined by an ultrasound-
FRET imaging system (Fig. 1B and Fig. S1) (19). Upon a focused
HFU (150 MHz) stimulation with a distance of 1 mm, a Piezo1-
dependent calcium influx was clearly detected in the target cell
(Fig. S2B), suggesting that Piezo1 can serve as a mechanosensor
to sense the ultrasound stimulation. For this 150-MHz focused
transducer, the focused acoustic pressure applied on the cell
membrane can directly activate the Piezo1 ion channel to mediate
calcium influx (Fig. S2B). However, this high-frequency 150-MHz
transducer has a limited working distance (1 mm) that is much
Significance
There is a lack of a general method to noninvasively and re-
motely manipulate cells with high spatiotemporal precisions.
We developed an ultrasound-based mechanogenetics system
to achieve this goal. Cells were engineered with the mecha-
nosensor Piezo1 and genetic transducing modules to perceive
the mechanical perturbation generated by the ultrasound
wave and transduce it into genetic activities. Mechanosensitive
and ultrasound-controllable T cells were further engineered to
target and eradicate tumor cells with inducible chimeric anti-
gen receptors. This mechanogenetics approach can be ex-
tended to remotely control, in principle, any gene activity in
live cells for the reprogramming of cellular functions. This
method should also provide a general approach to remotely
control molecular functions for biological studies and clinical
applications, particularly cell-based cancer immunotherapy.

 shorter than the effective working distance of centimeters with
low-frequency transducers. To develop a technology for the re-
mote control of gene activities in live cells, we reasoned that
microbubbles mechanically coupled to Piezo1 can be applied to
amplify the mechanical waves of low-frequency 2 MHz ultrasound
at a distance in centimeters (4–8). Indeed, microbubbles with a
2-μm diameter can be stimulated at a depth of 5 cm by a low-
frequency ultrasound transducer (Figs. S3 and S4). Hence,
microbubbles were coated with streptavidin and coupled to bio-
tinylated RGD peptides, which were engaged with the membrane
receptor integrins and connected to Piezo1 via cytoskeleton and
membrane tension (20, 21). Upon a 2-MHz ultrasound stimula-
tion at a distance of ∼1 cm, calcium influx into the cells was im-
mediately detected in the presence of calcium-containing HBSS
media (Fig. 1C and Movie S1), but not in HBSS media without
calcium. In control HEK293T cells transfected only with a calcium
biosensor but without Piezo1, there was no significant calcium
influx in HBSS media with or without calcium (Fig. 1C). This
2-MHz transducer activates the Piezo1 channel differently from
the 150-MHz transducer. For the 2-MHz transducer, the activation
depends on several factors, e.g., the oscillation of microbubbles and
possibly the resulting fluid microstreaming/shear stress associated
with the ultrasound excitation. Indeed, the Piezo1-expressing cells
without microbubble coupling did not respond to ultrasound to
trigger calcium signals (Fig. 1C). Ultrasound power was robustly
controlled in a range between 22.1 and 31.6 V to create a sufficient
ultrasound wave to mechanically stimulate the cells without
causing damage of the target cells (Fig. S5). Indeed, intermittent
ultrasound waves could be applied to elicit multiple calcium waves
(Fig. S5B), suggesting minimal ultrasound-induced alteration of
the target cells.
We then examined whether the ultrasound-induced calcium
influx can be applied to control gene expression. Genetic trans-
ducing modules (GTMs) were engineered to transmit the calcium-
mediated NFAT activation and other related signaling into genetic
activities. A one-stage GTM design was developed consisting of
three calcium responding elements in cis: a serum responding el-
ement (SRE), a cyclic adenosine monophosphate response ele-
ment (CRE), and a NFAT response element (NFAT RE), placed
in tandem upstream of the minimal promoters controlling target
gene expression (5) (Fig. 2 A, a and b). To reduce the potentially
leaky protein expression in cells and enhance the induction speci-
ficity upon stimulation, a two-stage GTM was designed using the
potent tripartite transcriptional activator VPR (22) (Fig. 2 A, c–f).
In these designs, the first induced product upon ultrasound stim-
ulation and calcium influx is a DNA-binding domain LexA fused to
VPR (LexA-VPR). Upon induction, this LexA-VPR activates a
second gene response element (LexA RE) for the expression of
target genes (Fig. 2 A, c–f). Two minimal promoters were com-
pared in their efficiency and specificity; the one derived from the
CMV promoter was more robust but exhibited a higher basal level
noise than the other one derived from the commercial vector

Design of synthetic genetic circuits remotely activatable by ultrasound. (A) Schematic drawing of ultrasound-induced cell activation and gene ex-
pression. Microbubbles can be coupled to the surface of a cell, where mechanosensitive Piezo1 channels are expressed. Upon exposure to ultrasound waves,
the mechanical stimulation can activate the Piezo1 ion channels. The subsequent calcium entry triggers the downstream pathways, including calcineurin
activation, NFAT dephosphorylation, and translocation into the nucleus. The nucleus-translocated NFAT can bind to upstream response elements to initiate
gene expression through one-stage or two-stage genetic transducing modules. (B) Diagram of an integrated system of ultrasound stimulation and FRET

 pGL4.30 (Promega). Collectively, six potential candidates were
designed (Fig. 2A) with luciferase or fluorescent proteins as target
reporter genes to characterize the activation potency. Indeed, 2-
MHz ultrasound stimulation for 10 min (see detailed information
in Materials and Methods) caused a clear induction of reporter
genes measured by luciferase activities (Fig. 2B), similar to the
chemical induction by ionomycin (Fig. 2C). We observed a signif-
icant difference in the basal and induced expression levels of target
genes upon stimulation with these six different designs (Fig. 2 A
and B). Among them, design a was chosen as the candidate for
further applications due to its simplicity, low basal level, and more
efficient activation potency. Indeed, the inducible promoter based
on design a can be activated by ultrasound stimulation to clearly
drive the expression of the GFP variant mNeonGreen (Fig. 2D).
These results indicate that the mechanosensor Piezo1 and GTMs
can be engineered and integrated to coordinate with the endoge-
nous molecular network for the sensing of remote ultrasound
stimulation to guide gene activations. We also showed that the
RGD-tagged microbubble engagement of integrins on the cell
surface alone was not sufficient to significantly activate the spe-
cifically designed gene expression controlled by genetic transducers
(Fig. S6A), suggesting a high specificity of the ultrasound control-
lable gene activation in our system. While the 10-min application
can induce relatively robust mechanogenetic effects, shorter du-
rations of ultrasound stimulation can also induce gene expression,
but with a weaker efficiency (Fig. S6B).
We next applied this system of remote-controlled mechanogenetics
(ReCoM) based on design a to control the expression of anti-CD19
CAR in Jurkat T-cell lines and primary human T cells (peripheral
blood mononuclear cells, or PBMCs) for cancer immunotherapy
since anti-CD19 CAR and CD19 have been well established as an
interaction pair for the immunotherapy of hematopoietic malig-
nancies (2, 23). Jurkat and PBMC T cells express high levels of
endogenous Piezo1 (24). Indeed, when microbubbles coated by
streptavidin were coupled to the biotinylated surface membrane of
Jurkat cells without the introduction of additional exogenous Piezo1
(Fig. 3A), calcium influx was observed upon ultrasound stimulation
(Fig. 3 B and C). Further experiments validated ReCoM in con-
trolling the production of the mNeonGreen reporter driven by dif-
ferent minimal promoters upon ultrasound stimulation in Jurkat
T cells without the need for coexpression of exogenous Piezo1 (Fig.
S7 A and B). We then applied ReCoM to control anti-CD19 CAR
production by ultrasound in Jurkat cells. The encoding mRNA and
expression percentage of anti-CD19 CAR in Jurkat cells was signif-
icantly increased after ultrasound stimulation (Fig. 3D and Fig. S7C).
The Jurkat cells with the ultrasound-induced CAR expression were
then incubated with CD19 antigen-expressing target tumor cells
(Toledo lymphoma tumor cells that express high levels of CD19)
(25). Upon the engagement of ultrasound-induced Jurkat and target
Toledo cells for 24 h, the surface marker CD69 reflecting T-cell
activation (26) was clearly up-regulated in the Jurkat cells (Fig. 3 E
and F). These results indicate that the ultrasound-induced CAR

 production in Jurkat T cells can functionally mediate the engage-
ment with antigens on the target tumor cells and activate Jurkat cells.
Then, we applied ReCoM to remotely control the CAR pro-
duction in PBMCs and examine their efficacy in tumor cell killing
(Fig. 4A). Calcium influx in PBMCs can be clearly observed upon
ultrasound stimulation (Fig. 4B). We further measured the ReCoM-
mediated expression of anti-CD19 CAR in PBMCs. The average
expression level of anti-CD19 CAR was significantly increased after
ultrasound stimulation (Fig. 4C). These ultrasound-induced PBMCs
were incubated with a target B-cell leukemia cell line (Nalm6)
expressing CD19-antigen and luciferase (27, 28), which allowed for
convenient tracking of the target tumor cell growth by measuring the
luciferase activities. The results of luciferase activity in surviving
target cells revealed that the ultrasound-induced ReCoM PBMCs
can cause significantly more toxicity of the target Nalm6 cells than
the ReCoM PBMCs not exposed to ultrasound or the plain PBMCs
exposed to ultrasound but without ReCoM GTMs (Fig. 4D).
Discussion
We report here the development of ReCoM technology to allow
the remote and noninvasive control of gene expression in live
cells with high spatiotemporal precision using ultrasound. Al-
though there have been disparate trial-and-error approaches to
apply ultrasound to mechanically perturb cells and Caeno-
rhabditis elegans (29–31), there was no established method as the
ReCoM presented here to convert the ultrasound mechanical
signals into genetic controls of cells. Indeed, we have demon-
strated that this ReCoM system can remotely control the ex-
pression of luciferase or mNeonGreen in various adherent or
suspension cells. We further established that ReCoM is effective
in controlling CAR expression in T cells to guide the recognition
and eradication of tumor cells for controllable cancer immuno-
therapy. This system is highly modular as shown by multiple
designs of genetic circuits with various basal levels and activation
potencies, thus allowing continuous evolution and optimization
to target multiple types of cancers and precancerous conditions.
In summary, ReCoM will usher in an era in life science and
medical technology by bringing the full power of remote control
of gene and cell activation to scientific and clinical communities
for precise control of therapeutics in space and time.
Materials and Methods
Ultrasonic Transducer and Stimulation System. Ultrasonic transducers were fab-
ricated with standard procedures (32). The center frequency of the ultrasonic
transducers is 2 MHz, and the aperture size is 5 mm. The transducer is un-
focused with the natural focus at ∼8.3 mm. The 150-MHz high-frequency fo-
cused transducer has the focus at ∼1 mm. The developed 2 or 150 MHz
ultrasonic transducers were integrated with a Nikon FRET microscope to stim-
ulate cells using ultrasound as well as to monitor molecular signals using FRET
imaging. The ultrasonic transducer was connected to a 3D mechanical stage to
control the position of the transducer. A pulser/receiver (Olympus), and an os-
cilloscope (Lecroy) were used to place the natural focus of the ultrasonic
transducer at the target cell as shown in Fig. 1B. To stimulate HEK293T cells for
calcium imaging, the 150-MHz ultrasonic transducer was positioned perpen-
dicularly to the dish bottom surface. The transducer was submerged in the

 medium 1 mm away from the cells. (Fig. S2A). The resultant peak-to-peak
voltage (Vpp) was 22.12–31.6 V. The acoustic pressure was ∼0.6 MPa for the
2-MHz transducer at the site of the bubbles and ∼3 MPa at the focus site for the
150-MHz high-frequency transducer. The duration of 150-MHz ultrasound
stimulation was 5–10 μs. The 2-MHz ultrasonic transducer was positioned at a
45° angle relative to the dish-bottom surface to avoid standing ultrasound
wave in a dish. The transducer was submerged in the medium 8.3 mm away
from the cells (Fig. S1A). The electrical signals were generated by a function
generator and a power amplifier to drive the ultrasonic transducer. The re-
sultant peak-to-peak voltage (Vpp) was 22.12–31.6 V. For the 2-MHz transducer,
pulse repetition frequency (PRF) was 5 Hz, and the duty factor was 10%. The
duration of ultrasound stimulation was 5 s for calcium imaging and 10 min for
gene induction of cells. During the 10-min ultrasound application, cells on the
glass-bottom dish were continuously scanned by ultrasound. Therefore, there
were multiple calcium transients generated during this time period. In fact,
results revealed varying strengths of mechanogenetic effects with different
durations of ultrasound stimulation (Fig. S6B). The expectation for micro-
bubbles to be attached to biotinylated surface of suspended cells is high. When
the number ratio of microbubble/cell is at 40, there is a significant binding
(>50%). When the number ratio of microbubble/cell is at 400, virtually 100% of
the cells are bound to microbubbles. In our experiments, we maintained the
number ratio of microbubble/cell at around 100, and on average, three to four
microbubbles were attached to each suspended T cell.
A glass tube was used to contain Jurkat cells and PBMCs, and the ultrasonic
transducer was positioned with a 45° angle with respect to the glass surface
for ultrasound stimulation. The transducer was placed at 8.3 mm away from
the cell–microbubble mixture inside the glass tube as shown in Fig. S1B. For
the glass tube experiments, Vpp was 22.12–31.6 V. The PRF and duty factor
were 100 Hz and 1%, respectively. The duration of ultrasound stimulation
was 10 min for these suspension cells.
Image Acquisition. The ultrasound stimulation/FRET imaging system was in-
tegrated with a Nikon fluorescence microscope for FRET imaging. Images
were collected by a Nikon and a cooled charge-coupled device (CCD) camera
using MetaFluor 6.2 and MetaMorph software (Universal Imaging) with a
420DF40 excitation filter, a 455DCXRU dichroic mirror, and two emission
filters controlled by a filter changer (480DF40 for CFP and 535DF35 for YFP). A
neutral density filter was used to control the intensity of the excitation light.
The fluorescence intensity of nontransfected cells was quantified as the
background signals and subtracted from the CFP and YFP signals on trans-
fected cells. The pixel-by-pixel ratio images of YFP/CFP were calculated based
on the background-subtracted fluorescence intensity images of CFP and YFP
by the Metafluor program to allow quantification and statistical analysis of
FRET responses. The emission ratio images were shown in the intensity
modified display mode (33).
Constructs and Plasmids. The construct of the mPiezo1-tdTomato was obtained
from Ardem Patapoutian’s laboratory, Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA
(34). The D3cpv calcium FRET biosensor was previously described (35). The
nucleotide sequence encoding the CD19-CAR, including the anti-human
CD19 scFv, the human CD8α hinge, the CD28 transmembrane and cos-
timulation domain, the human 4–1BB costimulation domain, and the CD3ζ
ITAM-signaling domain were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies (1).
Sequences encoding the VPR were obtained from Addgene (plasmids #63798)
(22). The plasmid-containing sequences encoding the calcium-dependent re-
sponse elements and minimal promoter were a gift from Jeffrey Friedman’s
laboratory, Rockefeller University, New York. Standard molecular cloning
techniques (PCR, restriction digestion, ligation, etc.) were applied to construct
CAR expression plasmids and produce lentivirus using the second-generation
self-inactivating lentiviral vector pHR’SIN:CSW.
Cell Culture and Reagents. HEK293T, Jurkat T cells, and Toledo cells were
purchased from the American Type Culture Collection. HEK293T cells were
cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium with 10% FBS (Gibco), 2 mM
L-glutamine, 1 unit/mL penicillin, 100 μg/mL streptomycin, and 1 mM sodium
pyruvate. Jurkat cells and Toledo cells were maintained in RPMI-1640 me-
dium supplemented with 10% FBS, penicillin, and streptomycin. Primary
human T cells were isolated from an anonymous healthy donor’s blood after
apheresis (San Diego Blood Bank). Purified PBMCs were cryopreserved in
culture RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 10% DMSO until use. During
experiments, PBMCs were maintained in RPMI-1640 medium supplemented
with 10% FBS and 30 units/mL IL-2 (PeproTech). All cells were cultured at
37 °C with 5% CO2. Ionomycin was purchased from Sigma.
Cell Preparation for Ultrasound Stimulation. For HEK293T cells, Targestar-SA lipid
microbubbles (Targeson) (1 × 109/mL) were mixed with biotinylated Arg-Gly-Asp
(RGD) peptides (0.01 mg/mL) (Peptide International) for 20 min (36). Immedi-
ately after removing the culture media in the dish, 5 μL of the microbubble–RGD
mixture was added into the dish. The dish was then flipped upside down for
5 min to allow microbubbles to float up and attach to the cell membrane.
For Jurkat cells and PBMCs, membrane proteins on the cell surface were
biotinylated by EZ-Link Sulfo-NHS-Biotin (2 mM) (ThermoFisher Scientific) for
15 min and washed with PBS before the cells were incubated with and
coupled to Targestar microbubbles.
Gene Activation Assays. For luciferase-based gene expression assay, the pRL-
TK plasmid (Promega) was cotransfected with the ReCoM luciferase reporters
using FUGENE 6 to normalize for transfection efficiency. Luciferase activity
was assayed 36–48 h after transfection, using a dual-luciferase reporter assay
system (Promega). In brief, cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 300 × g
for 3 min, resuspended in lysis buffer for 15 min, and then processed with a
plate reader (Tecan Infinite M1000 Pro) for luciferase assay and reading
quantifications.
For flow cytometry assay of fluorescent reporter expression, cells were
resuspended in FACS wash buffer (PBS + 0.5% BSA) and processed with a BD
Accuri C6 cytometer. FlowJo software (TreeStar) was used to quantify fluo-
rescence percentages and intensities.
For qPCR assay of CD19-CAR gene expression, total RNA from cells was
extracted by TRIzol. cDNA was synthesized with 500 ng of total RNA using
M-MLV transcriptase. Quantification of RNA levels was carried out using real-
time PCR (KAPA SYBR FAST qPCR kit) (KAPA) and normalized to the level
ACTB gene expression. Sequences of PCR primers are as follows: ReCoM-CAR,
5′-AAGTCCAGCTCCAGCAATCC-3′; and 5′-GGAAGGCTGACCCCACTAAC-3′.
Lentiviral Infection of Primary T Cells. Pantropic VSV-G pseudotyped lentivirus
was produced from Lenti-X 293T cells (#632180; Clontech Laboratories)
cotransfected with a pHR′SIN:CSW transgene expression vector and the viral
packaging plasmids pCMVdR8.91 and pCMV-VSV-G using Lipofectamine 2000
(Life Technologies). Viral medium/supernatant was collected 48 h after trans-
fection for infection. Three days before viral infection, primary human T
cells were thawed and activated using 2 μg/mL phytohemagglutinin (PHA)
(ThermoFisher Scientific) in RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS,
penicillin, and streptomycin for 72 h. PHA was then removed before cells
were infected. Infected primary T cells (PBMCs) were maintained at ∼106/mL in
culture RPMI medium supplemented with 30 units/mL IL2 for 5 d before
experiments were conducted.
Verification of CAR Expression in T Cells. Jurkat or primary human T cells were
resuspended in FACS wash buffer (PBS + 0.5% BSA) and stained with Alexa
Fluor 647 AffiniPure F(ab′)2 Fragment Goat Anti-Mouse IgG antibody
(JacksonImmunoResearch). Stained cells were washed three times in wash-
ing buffer PBS + 0.5% BSA and processed with a BD Accuri C6 cytometer.
FlowJo software (TreeStar) was used to quantify Alexa dye and/or mCherry
fluorescence intensities and percentages.
Quantitation of CD69 Surface Expression. Jurkat T cells after ultrasound acti-
vation were mixed with target Toledo cells at a 1:1 T-cell/target cell ratio in a
24-well plate. After 24 h of incubation, cells were pelleted by centrifugation at
300 × g for 5 min. Cells were resuspended in FACS wash buffer (PBS + 0.5%
BSA) and stained with APC anti-human CD69 antibody (#310910; BioLegend).
Stained cells were washed three times in FACS wash buffer and processed with
a BD Accuri C6 cytometer. FlowJo software (TreeStar) was applied to compare
Alexa fluorescence intensities of gated T cells (unique forward/side scatters) in
samples. Data plots were generated using Prism software (GraphPad).
Luciferase-Based Cell Killing Assay. PBMCs after ultrasound activation were
mixed with NALM-6 target cells at a 10:1 T-cell/target cell ratio in a 96-well
plate. After 24 h of incubation, cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 300 ×
g for 5 min. Cells were resuspended in 50 μL of lysis buffer (Promega) and
processed with a plate reader (Tecan Infinite M1000 Pro) for luciferase assay.
