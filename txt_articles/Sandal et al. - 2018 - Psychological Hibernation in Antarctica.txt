Human activity in Antarctica has increased sharply in recent years. In particular during
the winter months, people are exposed to long periods of isolation and confinement and
an extreme physical environment that poses risks to health, well-being and performance.
The present study aimed to gain a better understanding of processes contributing to
psychological resilience in this context. Specifically, the study examined how the use
of coping strategies changed over time, and the extent to which changes coincided
with alterations in mood and sleep. Two crews (N = 27) spending approximately
10 months at the Concordia station completed the Utrecht Coping List, the Positive
and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS), and a structured sleep diary at regular intervals
(x 9). The results showed that several variables reached a minimum value during
the midwinter period, which corresponded to the third quarter of the expedition. The
effect was particularly noticeable for coping strategies (i.e., active problem solving,
palliative reactions, avoidance, and comforting cognitions). The pattern of results could
indicate that participants during Antarctic over-wintering enter a state of psychological
hibernation as a stress coping mechanism.

INTRODUCTION
Antarctica is the darkest, coldest and most hostile region for humans on Earth. Antarctica has
no permanent residents, but many of the nations that are signatory to the Antarctic Treaty send
personnel to conduct seasonal (summer) and all year round research on the continent and the
Southern Ocean environments. Securing the human side of such expeditions is a matter of concern
as many participants are exposed to challenging living and working conditions that pose risks
to their safety, performance and psychological health. During the winter months, depending on
the location, people may be totally physically isolated from the outside world, with darkness and
weather conditions putting severe constraints on the possibility to travel. There are periods when
supplies cannot be transported to the stations and evacuation in case of emergencies may not be
possible. Although telecommunication between station and outside world has greatly improved in
recent years, these systems may temporarily break down and outside experts may not be available
for consultation at all times if help is needed. Key stressors for participants include lack of social
variation, monotony of the physical environment, confinement and limited privacy, and emotional
and physical deprivations. While there are large individual variations in psychological resilience,
foregoing research has long since documented that personnel overwintering on Antarctic stations
are vulnerable to mental and somatic health problems (Palinkas and Suedfeld, 2008; Arendt, 2012;
Chen et al., 2016). Indeed, reductions in mood, adaptation problems, and sleep difficulties account

Psychological Hibernation in Antarctica
for 60% of all diagnoses in Antarctica (Palinkas et al., 1995; Lugg,
2005). As these reactions seem most prevalent in the cold and
dark season, this cluster of symptoms has been referred to as the
‘
winter-over syndrome’
(Palmia, 1963; Palinkas et al., 1995).
Over the last decades, many research efforts have been
dedicated to explain the nature and causes of seasonal variations
in psychological resilience among personnel over-wintering in
Antarctica. The concept of resilience refers to the human
capacity to cope successfully (and even grow) under significant
adverse conditions (Fletcher and Sarkar, 2013). Three different
but potentially compatible mechanisms have been proposed to
explain the winter-over syndrome and subsequent impacts upon
a person’
s capacity to maintain resilience in the face of stress.
Firstly, the amount of daylight varies extremely across seasons
on these latitudes. Antarctica has just two seasons: summer
and winter. During summer at the poles, there is 6 months
of constant sunlight and in winter there is 6 months of total
darkness. These variations can significantly influence parameters
such as circadian rhythms, sleep, mood, and executive functions
(Beute and de Kort, 2014; LeGates et al., 2014; Collet et al.,
2015; Steinach et al., 2016; Pattyn et al., 2018). Indeed, this
explanation is supported by research that suggests exposure
to blue-enriched (short-wavelength) light as a countermeasure
may prevent circadian disorders among Antarctic over-winter
personnel (Najjar et al., 2014). Secondly, studies have shown cold-
related changes in thyroid function in Antarctica, referred to as
the polar triiodothyronine (T3) syndrome, characterized by an
increase in serum TSH, a decrease in free T4, and an increase in
T3 production and clearance. These changes have typically been
associated with decreased mood and cognitive impairment (Do
et al., 2004; Chen et al., 2016). Thirdly, research across different
confined and isolated contexts have suggested that psychological
resilience is linked to the relative passage of time, and that a
decrease tends to occur around the third quarter of the stay
independent of the actual duration, as the participants realize that
the mission is only half complete (Bechtel and Berning, 1991).
For winter-over crews the third quarter coincides with midwinter,
which may confound any difficulties experienced.
The third-quarter perspective suggests that psychological
resilience to some extent is associated with expectancies
about the duration of the stay. This idea is in line with
contemporary stress models which emphasize that appraisal is
critical to how individuals cope with challenging situations,
in turn predicting physiological activation (e.g., elevated levels
of adrenaline or cortisol, increased blood pressure and faster
heartbeats), psychological responses (e.g., feeling of distress,
anxiety, sleeping problems), and behavior (e.g., expression of
tension toward crewmates). While data from several studies
conducted among groups operating in polar environments have
indicated declines in mood and moral around the third quarter
(Stuster et al., 2000; Kjærgaard et al., 2013), empirical support
remains equivocal. An alternative perspective has been that
psychological resilience gradually declines as individual resources
are depleted (Palinkas and Houseal, 2000) and thus, that there is
a linear relationship between psychological resilience, experience
of stress, and time (Nicholas et al., 2015). In contrast to prior
explanations, other researchers have pointed out that many
participants also experience positive (salutogenic) effects from
successful adaptation to polar environments and report feelings
of personal growth and improvements in health (Palinkas and
Suedfeld, 2008).
Despite
considerable
research
into
how
the
Antarctic
environment impacts on psychological resilience, the process by
which people try to manage the demanding living conditions is
not well understood. According to Fletcher and Sarkar (2013)
psychological resilience influences the stress process at multiple
stages, the individual’
s appraisal of a potential stressor, his or her
meta-cognitions in reaction to felt emotions, and the choice of
coping strategies. Appropriate coping strategies serve to promote
optimal levels of activation either by eliminating or changing the
sources of stress (“
problem focused coping”
) or by decreasing
the emotional reactivity (“
emotion oriented coping”
) (Lazarus
and Folkman, 1984). A number of empirical studies have linked
coping responses to stable dispositional characteristics, and
researchers have showed that habitual strategies are associated
with adaptation in confined and isolated environments (Sandal
et al., 1999; Grant et al., 2007). In the present study, we argue that
a contextual approach to coping behavior will provide a more
refined understanding of the adaptation process among Antarctic
over-winterers. It is important to note that expeditioners may
respond differently in this context from how they normally
approach challenging situations (Smith et al., 2017). Firstly,
lengthy
isolation,
confinement,
and
demanding
physical
environments place limitations on certain coping strategies, and
amplify the importance on others (Palinkas and Browner, 1995;
Sandal et al., 1999). Secondly, expeditioners may adapt their
coping response to the challenges associated with different parts
of the sojourn. Researchers have noted that the cumulative effects
of chronic stressors may lead to a depletion of resources, which
in turn may result in a shift from active, problem-based coping to
more passive, emotion-based strategies (Couch and Coles, 2011).
According to transactional stress theory (Lazarus and Folkman,
1984), as a challenging situation develops, there is a continuing
interplay between appraisal, coping and emotion, each changing
and evolving as the transaction unfolds. Appraisal involves the
individual’
s evaluations of the situation and his or her own
resources, both of which are likely to change during the course of
an Antarctic over-winter. Studies of participants in polar crossing
teams indicate considerable flexibility in use of coping strategies
(Leon et al., 1991, 2011a; Suedfeld et al., 2017). To date, however,
few studies have addressed contextual changes in coping
strategies among personnel over-wintering on Antarctic stations.
The overall aim of the study was to build on previous work
and add to knowledge on processes contributing to psychological
resilience in the Antarctic context. Specifically, we monitored
coping strategies among personnel spending 10 months on a
research station in Antarctica, and examined to what extent these
changes coincided with alterations in mood and sleep. We studied
the time-based changes in four coping strategies: active problem
solving, palliative reactions, avoidance and passive expectancies,
and comforting cognitions. Active problem solving is reflective
of beliefs about own capacities to handle the situation, a coping
strategy that is associated with stress resilience (Levine and Ursin,
1991). In contrast and across a variety of settings, avoidance

Psychological Hibernation in Antarctica
and passive expectancies have been found to correlate with
feelings of distress, depression and physiological stress indicators
(Levine and Ursin, 1991; Kashdan et al., 2006). Palinkas and
Browner (1995) found an increase in depressive symptoms when
they compared scores at baseline with scores after the end
of a year in Antarctica, and this change was accompanied by
avoidance and emotional discharge as coping strategies. A similar
pattern was reported following a space simulation study in which
participants lived and worked together in a confined habitat for
105 days (Nicolas et al., 2013). Palliative reactions and comforting
cognitions have in common that they serve the purpose of
dampening the arousal or stress response although they do not
change the stressful situation. As noted by Leon et al. (2011b),
the ability to engage in emotionally oriented strategies, such
as comforting cognitions, is important in situations where the
stressor is chronic or not perceived as controllable as is the case
for many of the stressors that expeditioners experience while
overwintering in Antarctica. Supporting this view, Grant et al.
(2007) found that participants rated by station commanders
as “
exceptionally well adapted”had higher levels of emotion-
focused coping and fewer subjective health complaints than their
less well adapted counterparts. Based on the reviewed literature,
we expected that: (a) during midwinter participants report poorer
sleep quality, less positive affect (PA) and more negative affect; (b)
poorer sleep quality, less PA and more negative affect (NA) during
midwinter will coincide with a decrease in active problem solving,
comforting cognitions and palliative reactions, and increase in
avoidance and passive expectancies.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Participants
The sample consisted of members of two crews overwintering
on the Concordia station in Antarctica from the beginning of
February until November. Among station members in Crew 1,
14 consented to participate in the study. All of them were males,
with ages ranging from 23 to 58 years [M = 38.3, SD = 10.64].
Eight were Italians and six were French. The study sample
from Crew 2 included 13 respondents, among whom three
females, the age of the subjects ranged from 22 to 51 years
[M = 34.5, SD = 9.17], seven Italians and six French. Four
members of Crew 1 and five members of Crew 2 had previously
overwintered on Antarctica. Medical and psychiatric screening
was undertaken as part of the selection of participants. The crews
also underwent a 2-day long psychological training program
prior to departure preparing them for possible psychological and
social issues that may arise during the stay. The training program
focused on self-reflection, team building processes and coping
with communication problems.
The Physical Environment and the
Facilities at the Concordia Station
The Concordia Station (see Figure 1) is a permanently crewed
French-Italian research station located at an altitude of 3,232 m
at Dome C (75◦ 06� S, 123◦ 23� E), 1,000 km inland from the
coast of the Antarctic Ocean. The physical environment of the
FIGURE 1 | Concordia research base in Antarctica. Photo: ESA.
station has the driest desert climate on Earth and a low air-
pressure and oxygen-poor atmosphere. The mean temperature
is −51◦C, the lowest recorded temperature is −85◦C. Access to
the station is only possible from November to February due to
the cold and darkness. The station is 1500 m2 and comprises
three towers connected by enclosed walkways. The first tower,
called the quiet building, contains individual sleeping quarters,
two bathroom, three toilets, hospital, laboratories (glaciology,
meteorology, astronomy). The second tower, dedicated to noisy
rooms, houses the canteen, workshop, the waste water treatment
plant, social rooms (for video-watching, music), a gym, the
kitchen, and storage rooms. The third tower is made up of
eleven container size modules where the electric power plant, the
boiler room and a second workshop holding devices to measure
atmospheric data such as wind speed and humidity, are located.
The temperature inside the base is usually between 21 and 23◦C.
The base can accommodate about 60 people during the short
summer period, and can hold 15-16 crew members during
winter. Typically in winter, the crew includes four technicians,
a plumber, a cook, a medical doctor and 8-9 scientists typically
working in the fields of astronomy and astrophysics, glaciology,
atmospheric sciences and geophysics. Time spent outside the base
during winter is minimal because of the extreme temperatures
which again may lead to under-stimulation and boredom due
to the monotony of the indoor facilities. There are few forms
of entertainment on the base and daily life could be highly
repetitive (Salam, 2009). Communications with the outside world
were limited to satellite telephone, restricted email contacts and
there was no internet access at the time of the data collection.
Temporarily the telecommunication systems could break down
and the crew had to be self-reliant without opportunities to seek
advice from outside sources.
Measures
Coping Strategies
The UCL (Schreurs et al., 1993) measures different ways of
dealing with problems, and consists of 47 items to be answered

on a four-point scale from 1 (never or seldom) to 4 (very
often). The four scales included in the present research were
defined as follows (Gravdal and Sandal, 2006); (1) Active problem
solving (7 items): acting immediately and being goal-oriented,
sorting things out; (2) Palliative reactions (8 items): engaging
in other activities, trying to relax; (3) Avoidance and passive
expectancies (8 items): withdrawing from problematic situations;
(4) Comforting cognitions (5 items): thinking that worse things
happen, or that the situation may not be as bad as it seems. Higher
scores on the scales indicate more frequent use of the specific
coping strategies. UCL was administered every month during the
stay on Concordia.
Sleep Diary
The expedition members completed a sleep diary in the first
week of each month during the stay. The diary comprises
daily estimates of parameters such as bedtime, light out time,
sleep onset latency (time between falling asleep and turning off
the light), number and duration of awakenings, time of final
awakening, rise time, and sleep quality (Carney et al., 2012). In
this paper, we only refer to data on the subjective evaluation of
sleep quality. Sleep quality was indicated on a five point scale from
very bad (1) to very good (5).
Affective States
The PANAS (Watson et al., 1988) is a self-report adjective
checklist
measuring
affective
states.
Two
higher-order
dimensions of positive affect (PA) and negative affect (NA)
are
measured
by
subscales
each
consisting
of
10-items.
Items designed to measure PA include feeling active, alert,
attentive, determined, enthusiastic, excited, inspired, interested,
proud, and strong, while items designed to measure NA
include feeling afraid, ashamed, distressed, guilty, hostile,
irritated, jittery, nervous, scared, and upset. For each item,
subjects rated whether they had felt that way over the
past week on a scale from very slightly or not at all (1)
to extremely (5). Scores for PA and NA were obtained by
averaging the scores on the included items. Completion of
the PANAS was scheduled every month during the stay on
Concordia.
Procedure
The Regional Medical Committee for Research Ethics (REK
West, Norway) approved the experimental protocol. All subjects
were fully informed as to the nature of the investigation and
were told their rights, such as the right to withdraw from the
experiment at any time, and signed a Declaration of Consent
Form providing this information. One of the investigators met
with the participants prior to their departure to Antarctica to
inform them about the study. A unique code was assigned to each
participant in order to monitor longitudinal data and to protect
participant anonymity. All questionnaires were administered
in the native language of the participants (either French or
Italian).
Data Analysis
Data was analyzed using SPSS statistics 24 (IBM, 2016). We
first used repeated measures multivariate analysis of variance
to address changes in scores across the 9-month stay at
the research situation. The nine measurement occasions were
included as repeated measures factor and the scale scores as
dependent variables. We then continued to address time course
changes using correlational analysis to compare relations between
psychological variables in the months prior to (months 1 – 4)
and post winter (months 5 – 9). A caveat is warranted before
presenting the results of the analyses. Our sample size of 27
participants may be large for a study of consequences of living in
such a contrived, harsh environment, but for statistical purposes
the sample size is relatively small.
RESULTS
Scales means and 95% confidence intervals from the repeated
measures multivariate analysis of variance are presented in
Figures 2, 3. The first data point in the graphs is the baseline
level. As can be seen from Figure 1, NA scores were continuously
low during the entire stay at the station and did not change
over time. PA and the coping strategies scores are patterned
having a minimum around cold and dark mid-winter months.
This pattern is indicative of a quadratic relationship between time
and the dependent variables. Table 1 presents linear, quadratic
and cubic components and their significance. As can be seen,
the quadratic equations produced the largest effect sizes, notably
for the coping strategies scores and PA, followed by the linear
component. Only for subjective sleep quality, the linear equation
produced the largest effect size (the quadratic effect just failed to
reach significance, p = 0.06). Cubic equations tended to produce
small effects, only reaching significance for the coping strategy,
comforting cognitions.
Findings from the correlational analysis are reported in
Table 2. Correlations between the psychological variables and
time during the first 4 months were mostly negative (note that
NA was reverse scored). In the latter 4 months (i.e., months 5 –
9) correlations were positive. Correlations corroborate findings
from the repeated measures analysis and highlight a pattern
of depleting resources when going toward the cold period and
replenishing of resources in the second half of the overwinter stay.
DISCUSSION
The findings from this study suggest that coping strategies, sleep
quality, and PA were influenced by the environmental conditions
to a smaller or larger degree during midwinter. Quadratic time-
based models demonstrated the greatest effect sizes, suggesting
that when the conditions are harshest, resources are more
depleted and participants were less involved in any form of
coping and reported less PA. Also subjective sleep quality showed
a negative trend over time, a result consistent with other research
(Bhargava et al., 2000; Pattyn et al., 2018) although at the end of
the stay the average score did increase slightly. While chronic

hypoxia might lead to deterioration in sleep quality in high
altitude (Collet et al., 2015), the effect of hypoxia on adaptation
among residents on Concordia has been shown to persist over
time (Porcelli et al., 2018). Thus, we argue that hypoxia cannot
explain seasonal variations in sleep quality observed in this study.
The reduction in sleep quality and PA is consistent with the
“
midwinter syndrome”observed by other researchers (Bhargava
et al., 2000; Palinkas and Suedfeld, 2008). It is noticeable that
reports of NA remained low over time and did not show the
expected change during midwinter. One possible explanation is
that participants were reluctant to report distress.
Perhaps the most striking result from this study was
the reduction in all of observed coping strategies during
the midwinter period. This pattern contradicts the idea that
emotional strategies and avoidance take over from more
active strategies in situations involving chronic stressors.
Our findings may reflect that participants became more
indifferent or emotionally flat during the winter months.
This interpretation is consistent with early research which
noted the occurrence of a mild psychological fugue state
known as the Antarctic stare, around the third quarter of
the stay (Barabasz et al., 1983). The phenomenon state is
characterized by an altered state of consciousness or pronounced
absentmindedness, “
drifting,” wandering off attention, and
deterioration in situational awareness. We believe that this
reaction is not unique to people overwintering in Antarctica.
For example, during a 520 days confinement study (MARS500)
crew members reported reduced need for stimulation around the
third quarter (Sandal and Bye, 2015). Interactions between crew
members declined, and one crew member showed indications
of dissociation. The state of seeking reduced stimulation, and
emotional flatness bears resemblance to what could be called
“
psychological hibernation.”A state of psychological hibernation
may be beneficial for coping with the harshness of prolonged
exposure to stress in extreme environments. The ability to “
switch
off”mentally has been associated with positive outcomes in the
work stress literature (Sonnentag and Bayer, 2005). However,
psychological detachment has also been described as a symptom
of burnout after prolonged exposure to stress at work (Maslach
and Leiter, 2016). Whilst psychological hibernation could be
an adaptive response to the extreme conditions, especially if it
disappears when conditions become less extreme (as evidenced
by the increase in coping strategy use reported in the present
study), understanding the nature of this phenomenon should be
an avenue for future research. Further research is also needed to
determine the extent to which this state might be associated with
decrement in cognitive function and the ability to react to acute,
safety-critical situations. So far studies on cognitive performance
investigations on Antarctica have been controversial. While no
detectable cognitive deterioration was found in a study of a
crew overwintering on Concordia (Barkaszi et al., 2016), other
researchers have shown that residence in Antarctica had a
detrimental effect on cognition (Reed et al., 2001).
We acknowledge that the present findings need to be
replicated on a larger or multiple samples. A limitation of this
study is that data is based on self-reports (questionnaires), and
that responses may be influenced by report biases such as social
desirability (although social desirability cannot be used to explain
the seasonal patterning of coping). Steinach et al. (2016) found
that female over-winterers showed a greater decline in sleep
quality than men indicating that they are more susceptible to
stressors in the Antarctic. In the present study, gender effects
could not be examined due to the small number of female
participants (N = 3).
Overall, our findings raise further questions regarding the
nature of adaptation and the day-to-day and month-to-month
functioning of expeditioners in extreme and unusual settings.
The existence of “
the third quarter phenomenon”characterized
by low motivation, interpersonal tension and low mood has
been controversial among researchers (Smith and Sandal,
2017). While this study suggests that psychological change
indeed occurs in this phase, we question whether this phase
is characterized by reduced resilience. Rather we suggest, in
line with salutogenic reactions observed in many expedition
studies including those in Antarctica (Palinkas and Suedfeld,
2008), that psychological hibernating in itself may represent an
adaptive way of coping with the harshness of over-wintering,
and therefore associated with psychological resilience in this
context. This way of coping is different from the conventional
coping classification (problem-focused, emotion-focused, and
avoidance) and is mainly characterized by a low level of
activation, a decrease in coping and PA, but no change in NA.
If hibernation is indeed an adaptive coping mechanism, this
may have implications for countermeasures aimed at maintaining
psychological resilience in confined environments, such as
research stations in Antarctica or long-duration spaceflight.
For example, psychological detachment may be facilitated by

stress amelioration techniques such as yoga, meditation and self-
hypnosis. While we are not aware of empirical studies evaluating
the efficiency of such countermeasures in confined environments,
anecdotal reports from Antarctic expeditions suggest that people
do practice such techniques and that these have been experienced
as helpful in maintaining psychological resilience during the
harsh winter period (Sharma, 2001; Weiss et al., 2007).
