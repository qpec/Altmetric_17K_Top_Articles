SUMMARY
Lifestyle factors including diet play an important role in the survival of cancer patients. However, 
the molecular mechanisms underlying pathogenic links between diet and particular oncogenic 
mutations in human cancers remain unclear. We recently reported that the ketone body 
acetoacetate selectively enhances BRAF V600E mutant-dependent MEK1 activation in human 
cancers. Here we show that a high-fat ketogenic diet increased serum levels of acetoacetate, 
leading to enhanced tumor growth potential of BRAF V600E-expressing human melanoma cells in

 xenograft mice. Treatment with hypolipidemic agents to lower circulating acetoacetate levels or an 
inhibitory homologue of acetoacetate, dehydroacetic acid, to antagonize acetoacetate-BRAF 
V600E binding attenuated BRAF V600E tumor growth. These findings reveal a signaling basis 
underlying a pathogenic role of dietary fat in BRAF V600E-expressing melanoma, providing 
insights into the design of conceptualized “precision diets” that may prevent or delay tumor 
progression based on an individual’s specific oncogenic mutation profile.
Graphical Abstract
INTRODUCTION
The link between diet and cancer prevention is well supported by a large amount of data 
derived from diverse epidemiological studies as well as preclinical studies using 
experimental animals. Overall, despite a poor understanding of the complex interactions of 
diverse dietary components, these epidemiological studies consistently support inverse 
relationships between cancer risk and intake of “healthy food” such as vegetables, fruits, 
whole grains and dietary fiber, and direct relationships between cancer risk and dietary fat as 
well as other “calorie-dense food” such as deep fried food and processed meat [reviewed in 
(Greenwald et al., 2001; Miller, 1990)]. However, these epidemiological studies are more 
descriptive than mechanistic in nature, and many questions remain to be resolved. It is 
unclear, for example, which specific dietary factors are predominantly important in 
providing a cancer prevention effect and how they may function alone and/or interact with 
other dietary factors to control cancer risk in all or specific cancer types. Most importantly, 
although epidemiological data suggest a general connection between diet and cancer risk, 
pathogenic links between diet and particular oncogenic mutations in certain cancer types 
remain unknown.
Understanding the molecular details of metabolic alterations in cancer may suggest 
connections between cancer risk and certain diets that fuel cancer-related metabolic changes,

 which are informative to the development and design of diets that can lower cancer risk and 
improve treatment. For example, increasing evidence suggests that different human cancers 
may share common metabolic properties such as the Warburg effect, in which cancer cells 
avidly consume glucose (Kim and Dang, 2006; Kroemer and Pouyssegur, 2008), suggesting 
that cancer may thrive on sugar and thus a sugar-depleted “diet therapy” may lower cancer 
risk. In fact, a ketogenic diet (high-fat, adequate-protein and low-carbohydrate) has been 
evaluated for cancer prevention and treatment purposes to attenuate tumor development by 
limiting carbohydrate supply (Tennant et al., 2010). However, the clinical efficacy of such 
diet therapies may vary due to the fact that distinct oncogenic backgrounds in different 
cancer types require different metabolic properties for tumor development.
We recently performed a systematic RNAi-based screen and identified metabolic 
vulnerabilities specifically required by oncogenic BRAF V600E mutant, but not other 
oncogenes such as NRAS Q61R/K, in human melanoma (Kang et al., 2015). More than 50% 
of melanomas express BRAF V600E mutant, which represents a therapeutic target due to its 
pathogenic role (Bollag et al., 2012; Gibney et al., 2013; Johnson and Sosman, 2013). 
Moreover, BRAF V600E mutation is also found in 10% of colorectal cancer (Benlloch et al., 
2006; Sebolt-Leopold and Herrera, 2004), 100% of hairy cell leukemia (HCL) (Arcaini et 
al., 2012) and 5% of multiple myeloma (Chapman et al., 2011) cases. We found that HMG-
CoA lyase (HMGCL), a key enzyme in ketogenesis producing ketone bodies, is selectively 
essential in melanoma cells expressing BRAF V600E (Kang et al., 2015). Ketogenesis 
mainly occurs in the mitochondria of liver cells, which normally produce ketone bodies as a 
result of fatty acid breakdown to generate energy when glucose levels in the blood are low 
(Balasse and Fery, 1989; McPherson and McEneny, 2012). HMGCL converts HMG-CoA to 
acetyl-coA and a ketone body, acetoacetate, which can be further converted to two other 
ketone bodies, including D-β-hydroxybutyrate (3HB) and acetone (Cotter et al., 2013; 
Morris, 2005). We found that oncogenic BRAF V600E upregulates HMGCL gene 
expression in cancer cells. HMGCL in turn selectively promotes BRAF V600E-dependent 
phosphorylation and activation of MEK1 by controlling intracellular levels of its product 
acetoacetate, which specifically promotes BRAF V600E (but not BRAF WT) binding to 
MEK1 (Kang et al., 2015). These results support an emerging “metabolic rewiring” concept 
in which distinct oncogenes may require different metabolic alterations for tumor growth.
Moreover, our findings suggest that a ketogenic diet would likely worsen the disease burden 
in BRAF V600E-positive cancer patients. Since acetoacetate is cell permeable (Kang et al., 
2015), herein we tested a hypothesis that, in addition to the increased intracellular 
acetoacetate levels induced by BRAF V600E, dietary fat-fueled ketogenesis may promote 
BRAF V600E melanoma growth in vivo through increased circulating and consequently 
intracellular levels of acetoacetate.
RESULTS
High dietary fat elevates serum acetoacetate to promote BRAF V600E tumor growth
We found that high-fat diets in either solid or paste forms resulted in increased growth rates, 
masses and sizes of tumors without affecting body weight in nude mice with BRAF V600E-
expressing human melanoma A375 cell xenografts (Figures 1A and S1A; upper panels). In

 contrast, a high-fat diet did not affect tumor growth rates, masses or sizes or body weight in 
mice with control SK-MEL-2 tumor xenografts expressing an active NRAS Q61R mutant 
(Figure 1A and S1A; lower panels). The increased tumor growth in A375 xenograft mice fed 
a high-fat diet was not due to differences in food intake amounts (Figure S1B). In both A375 
and SK-MEL-2 models, consumption of a high-fat diet did not significantly affect serum 
levels of D-β-hydroxybutyrate (3HB) (Figure 1C), but significantly increased serum 
cholesterol levels (Figure 1D) and reduced serum glucose levels (Figure S1C), compared to 
control mice fed with normal food. Serum levels of acetoacetate were also increased in both 
A375 and SK-MEL-2 xenograft mice fed with high-fat diets (Figure 1B). The increased 
serum levels of acetoacetate led to enhanced phosphorylation of MEK1 and ERK1/2 without 
affecting HMGCL expression (Figure 1E), as well as increased binding between BRAF 
V600E-MEK1 (Figure 1F) in tumors derived from A375 cells but not control SK-MEL-2 
cells, compared to corresponding control xenograft mice fed with normal food. Consistent 
with these findings, consumption of a high-fat diet resulted in increased cell proliferation 
rates in tumors derived from A375 cells but not control SK-MEL-2 cells, assessed by 
increased immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining of Ki67, compared to corresponding control 
xenograft mice fed with normal food (Figures 1G and S1D). Similar results were obtained in 
nude mice carrying BRAF V600E-expressing human melanoma A2058 xenograft tumors 
compared to mice with control PMWK cell xenografts expressing BRAF wild-type (WT) or 
HMCB cell xenografts expressing an active NRAS Q61K mutant (Figure S1E–S1J).
Intraperitoneal injection with acetoacetate but not 3HB promotes BRAF V600E tumor 
growth
We found that intraperitoneal injection with acetoacetate but not 3HB resulted in increased 
growth rates and masses of tumors derived from BRAF V600E-expressing A375 melanoma 
cells in xenograft nude mice (Figure 2A; upper left and right, respectively). In contrast, 
injection with either acetoacetate or 3HB had no effect on growth rates or masses of tumor 
xenografts derived from control NRAS Q61K-expressing HMCB cells (Figure 2A; lower 
left and right, respectively).
We chose to use the lithium salt form of acetoacetate, which provides the anion form of 
acetoacetate that is approximately 55 times more stable with a half-life of 130 hours than the 
acid form (acetoacetic acid) with a half-life of 140 minutes at 37°C in water (Hay, 1967). To 
exclude potential effects of the lithium ion, we performed a series of experiments using a 
control salt lithium chloride. We found that lithium chloride did not bind to purified BRAF 
V600E in a thermal shift assay (Figure S2A) or promote the association between purified 
BRAF V600E and MEK1 (Figure S2B) as acetoacetate does. Consistently, treatment with 
lithium chloride did not affect phosphorylation levels of MEK1 or ERK1/2, BRAF V600E-
MEK1 binding, or cell proliferation rates in diverse BRAF V600E positive or negative 
human melanoma cells (Figure S2C–S2E, respectively). Moreover, lithium chloride 
treatment did not affect tumor growth potential of BRAF V600E-expressing A375 cells in 
xenograft mice in vivo (Figure S2F), nor did it affect serum levels of acetoacetate, 3HB, 
cholesterol or glucose (Figure S2G), phosphorylation levels of MEK1 or ERK1/2, BRAF 
V600E-MEK1 binding, or cell proliferation potential in tumors derived from A375 cells in 
xenograft mice (Figure S2H–S2J, respectively). In addition, similar studies were performed

 to exclude possible effects from the potential degradation product of acetoacetate, acetone. 
We found that acetone did not bind to purified BRAF V600E in both thermal shift assay and 
a binding assay using 14C-labeled acetone (Figure S3A, left and right, respectively) or affect 
the association between purified BRAF V600E and MEK1 (Figure S3B). Acetone also did 
not affect phosphorylation levels of MEK1 or ERK1/2, BRAF V600E-MEK1 binding, or 
cell proliferation rates in diverse BRAF V600E positive or negative human melanoma cells 
(Figure S3C–S3E, respectively). These results, together with our previous finding that 14C-
labeled acetoacetate binds to purified BRAF V600E (Kang et al., 2015), suggest that the 
anion form of acetoacetate is the functional compound that binds to and regulates BRAF 
V600E.
Consistently, intraperitoneal injection with acetoacetate led to increased serum levels of 
acetoacetate (Figure 2B) but did not affect serum levels of 3HB (Figure 2C), whereas 3HB 
injection increased serum levels of β-hydroxybutyrate (Figure 2C) but not acetoacetate 
(Figure 2B). Similarly, chronic injection of acetoacetate or 3HB to nude mice for 4 weeks 
resulted in increased serum acetoacetate but not 3HB levels or increased 3HB but not 
acetoacetate levels, respectively (Figure S3F). Such chronic treatments to mice did not alter 
the acetoacetate or 3HB levels in urine (Figure S3G), suggesting the dosages of acetoacetate 
and 3HB were insufficient to induce acidosis in mice. Moreover, injection of mice carrying 
A375 xenografts with acetoacetate but not 3HB resulted in enhanced phosphorylation of 
MEK1 and ERK1/2 (Figure 2D), enhanced BRAF V600E-MEK1 association (Figure 2E), 
increased tumor sizes (Figure S3H), and enhanced cell proliferation rates assessed by 
increased Ki67 IHC staining (Figures 2F and S3I). In contrast, in mice with HMCB 
xenografts, injection of either acetoacetate or β-hydroxybutyrate did not affect MEK-ERK 
activation (Figure 2D), BRAF–MEK1 binding (Figure 2E) or cell proliferation rates (Figures 
2F and S3I) in harvested tumors. Together, these data suggest that dietary fat likely promotes 
tumor growth potential of BRAF V600E-expressing melanoma cells in vivo through 
elevation of serum levels of acetoacetate.
Hypolipidemic agents attenuate BRAF V600E tumor growth by reducing serum levels of 
acetoacetate
We next examined whether treatment with hypolipidemic agents may attenuate circulating 
acetoacetate levels and consequently BRAF V600E tumor growth potential in mice. We 
chose three drugs that are clinically used to treat hypercholesterolemia, including fluvastatin 
that belongs to a class of cholesterol-lowering statins as HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors 
(Avis et al., 2007); niacin (a.k.a. vitamin B3) that lowers triglycerides and is also clinically 
used to treat cardiovascular patients not taking a statin (Jacobson et al., 1994); and 
fenofibrate, a fibric acid derivative that also lowers triglycerides (Superko, 1989).
We found that fluvastatin and niacin treatment effectively attenuated tumor growth potential 
of BRAF V600E-expressing A375 cells in xenograft mice, which could be reversed by 
intraperitoneal injection with acetoacetate (Figure 3A, top; and Figure S4A, left). Similarly, 
treatment with fenofibrate attenuated tumor growth potential of BRAF V600E-expressing 
A2058 melanoma cells in xenograft nude mice (Figure 3A, middle and Figure S4A, upper 
right), but not control mice injected with NRAS Q61K-expressing HMCB cells (Figure 3A, 
Xia et al.

 bottom and Figure S4A, lower right). Intraperitoneal acetoacetate injection effectively 
rescued the decreased tumor growth of A2058 cells in mice treated with fenofibrate but had 
no effect on tumor growth potential of HMCB cells in xenograft mice. Consistent with these 
findings, treatment with fluvastatin, niacin or fenofibrate resulted in reduced serum levels of 
acetoacetate but not β-hydroxybutyrate in mice (Figures 3B and 3C, respectively), while 
acetoacetate injection rescued the decreased serum acetoacetate levels but did not affect 3HB 
levels. Although these three drugs did not affect serum glucose levels (Figure S4B) or body 
weight (Figure S4C) of mice and only niacin treatment resulted in marginally decreased 
serum cholesterol levels that were not affected by acetoacetate injection (Figure 3D), all 
three hypolipidemic agents effectively reduced serum levels of triglyceride in mice despite 
acetoacetate injection (Figure 3E). Consistently, fluvastatin, niacin, or fenofibrate treatment 
resulted in decreased phosphorylation of MEK1 and ERK1/2 (Figure 3F), decreased BRAF 
V600E-MEK1 association (Figure 3G), and reduced cell proliferation rates as evidenced by 
decreased Ki67 IHC staining (Figures 3H and S4D–S4E) only in tumors derived from 
BRAF V600E-expressing A375 and A2058 cells but not control HMCB cells, whereas these 
inhibitory effects were effectively reversed by injection with acetoacetate. Similar results 
were obtained in fluvastatin or niacin-treated xenograft nude mice injected with A2058 cells 
(Figure S4F–S4H).
Discovery and characterization of dehydroacetic acid (DHAA) as an inhibitory homologue 
of acetoacetate
We next sought to determine whether functional inhibition of acetoacetate would attenuate 
BRAF V600E tumor growth. We examined a group of commercially available acetoacetate 
analogues and found dehydroacetic acid (DHAA) (Figure 4A) is an inhibitory homologue of 
acetoacetate. Similar to acetoacetate (Kang et al., 2015), DHAA also directly binds to BRAF 
V600E but not BRAF WT in a thermal melt shift assay using purified recombinant BRAF 
WT or V600E incubated with increasing concentrations of DHAA (Figure 4B). Moreover, in 
a cellular thermal shift assay using cell lysates from 293T cells transfected with FLAG-
tagged BRAF WT or V600E, both acetoacetate (400µM) and DHAA (400µM) bound only to 
BRAF V600E but not WT, and DHAA bound to BRAF V600E with higher affinity than 
acetoacetate (Figure 4C). In addition, we performed a series of radiometric metabolite-
protein interaction analyses using 14C-labeled acetoacetate incubated with purified BRAF 
variants in the presence and absence of DHAA. As shown in Figure 4D, 14C-labeled 
acetoacetate specifically bound to BRAF V600E and a V600E mutant of an active, truncated 
C-terminal domain of BRAF (tBRAF, 416–766 aa) (Brummer et al., 2006), but not to 
control proteins including BRAF WT, tBRAF WT or a truncated N-terminal domain of 
BRAF (BRAF-N, 1–415 aa), whereas treatment with DHAA resulted in a significant 
decrease in binding ability of BRAF V600E mutant forms to acetoacetate (Figure 4D). 
Additionally, DHAA competed with acetoacetate for BRAF V600E binding in a dose-
dependent manner in a binding assay where purified BRAF V600E mutant pre-treated 
with 14C-labeled acetoacetate was incubated with increasing concentrations of DHAA 
(Figure 4E). Furthermore, pre-treatment of purified BRAF V600E mutant with DHAA 
(200µM) was sufficient to block acetoacetate binding to recombinant BRAF V600E 
incubated with increasing concentrations of 14C-labeled acetoacetate up to 400µM (Figure 
4F).

 These data together suggest that DHAA binds to BRAF V600E with a higher affinity that 
enables DHAA to compete with acetoacetate for V600E binding. Consistently, we found 
that 14C-labeled acetoacetate bound only to BRAF proteins harboring different substitutions 
of V600 including clinically reported V600E, V600D and V600R with Kd values 
determined as approximately 92µM, 93µM and 113µM, respectively, but not to a negative 
control mutant V600A or to other clinically reported BRAF mutants including L597Q and 
K601E (Figure 4G, left). Moreover, DHAA effectively competed for AA binding with 
BRAF V600E, V600D and V600R in the presence of 300µM 14C-labeled acetoacetate with 
Ki values determined as approximately 88µM, 88µM and 91µM, respectively (Figure 4G, 
right). These findings are also consistent with results from a binding assay using 14C-labeled 
acetoacetate incubated with diverse BRAF mutants, where acetoacetate bound to V600E, 
V600D and V600R but not to control V600A mutant or other clinically reported BRAF 
mutants including K507E, N581S, D594N, L597Q, K601E, and S616F (Figure S5A, upper), 
and acetoacetate promoted MEK1 binding to BRAF V600E, V600D and V600R with 
increased MEK1 phosphorylation, but not to other BRAF mutants (Figure S5A, lower).
We next sought to determine whether DHAA inhibits BRAF V600E directly. Previously we 
demonstrated that acetoacetate binding resulted in increased Vmax and slightly decreased 
Km of BRAF V600E using MEK1 as a substrate (Kang et al., 2015). Interestingly, we found 
that treatment with increasing concentrations of DHAA alone did not affect BRAF V600E 
kinase activity with unaltered Vmax and Km (Figure 4H, left). In contrast, DHAA treatment 
effectively reversed the activating effect of acetoacetate on BRAF V600E in terms of 
increased Vmax and decreased Km of BRAF V600E in the presence of acetoacetate 
(300µM) when using MEK1 as a substrate (Figure 4H, right). Further mechanistic studies 
revealed that DHAA treatment effectively inhibited acetoacetate-enhanced MEK1 binding to 
BRAF V600E and consequent phosphorylation of V600E-bound MEK1 in a cell-free, in 
vitro coupled protein-protein binding and kinase assay using purified recombinant BRAF 
V600E pre-treated with acetoacetate (300µM) and incubated with recombinant purified 
MEK1 as a substrate (Figure 4I right panel). In contrast, DHAA had no effect on BRAF 
WT-MEK1 binding or MEK1 phosphorylation in a control experiment using purified BRAF 
WT incubated with MEK1 in the presence of acetoacetate (Figure 4I left panel). Notably, 
DHAA at 200µM was sufficient to compete with acetoacetate at 300µM for BRAF V600E 
binding (Figures 4E, 4F and 4H) and inhibit BRAF V600E-MEK1 binding and 
phosphorylation of MEK1 enhanced by acetoacetate at 300µM (Figure 4I). This is 
physiologically consistent with the acetoacetate levels determined as approximately 300µM 
in stable HMGCL knockdown A375 and A2058 cells (Kang et al., 2015). These results 
together are consistent with our hypothesis that mutation at V600 is the predominant 
mechanism underlying acetoacetate binding to BRAF protein, and DHAA primarily 
functions by competing with acetoacetate for mutant BRAF binding.
DHAA selectively inhibits cell proliferation and tumor growth potential of BRAF V600E 
melanoma cells
Next we found that DHAA treatment selectively inhibited cell proliferation of A375, A2058 
and SK-MEL-5 cells expressing BRAF V600E and WM-266-4 cells expressing BRAF 
V600D (Figures 5A and S5B), but not control PMWK, CHL-1 and MeWo cells expressing

 BRAF WT or HMCB and SK-MEL-2 cells expressing active NRAS mutants (Figures 5A 
and S5B). Consistent with these findings, DHAA treatment selectively inhibited 
phosphorylation of MEK1 and ERK1/2 (Figure 5B) and BRAF V600E-MEK1 association 
(Figure 5C) only in BRAF V600E-expressing A375 and A2058 cells but not in control 
PMWK or HMCB cells. The inhibitory effect of DHAA on diverse BRAF V600E-
expressing cells could not be reversed by acetoacetate treatment in terms of reduced cell 
proliferation (Figures 5D and S5C) or decreased MEK-ERK activation (Figure 5E). Similar 
results were obtained using immortalized melanocyte Mel-ST cells overexpressing BRAF 
WT, V600E or tBRAF, where DHAA treatment selectively inhibited cell proliferation, 
MEK-ERK activation and BRAF V600E-MEK1 binding in BRAF V600E-expressing cells 
but not parental or control cells expressing BRAF WT or tBRAF (Figures 5F–5H, 
respectively). In addition, acetoacetate treatment did not reverse the inhibitory effect of 
DHAA on BRAF V600E-expressing Mel-ST cell proliferation (Figure 5I).
Consistent with these findings, DHAA treatment for ~3.5 weeks effectively inhibited tumor 
growth rates, sizes and masses in nude mice with BRAF V600E-expressing human 
melanoma A2058 and A375 cell xenografts but not in mice carrying control xenografts 
derived from HMCB cells expressing NRAS Q61K (Figures 6A and S6A). Notably, DHAA 
treatment did not affect acetoacetate or β-hydroxybutyrate levels in tumors harvested from 
xenograft mice (Figures 6B–6C, respectively). In contrast, DHAA treatment selectively 
inhibited phosphorylation of MEK1 and ERK1/2 without affecting HMGCL expression 
(Figure 6D), reduced binding between BRAF V600E-MEK1 (Figure 6E), and reduced cell 
proliferation rates as assessed by IHC staining of Ki67 (Figures 6F and S6B) in tumors 
derived from A2058 or A375 cells but not control HMCB cells, compared to corresponding 
control xenograft mice treated with water.
DHAA is a synthetic organic compound that is used mostly as a fungicide and bactericide 
(Stedman et al., 1954), showing little to no clinical toxicity or irritating potential and has 
been safely used in skin care products. Consistently, chronic injection of DHAA to nude 
mice for ~4 weeks revealed that 200 mg/kg/day administered intraperitoneally is a well-
tolerated dose, which did not cause notable differences in histopathological analyses and 
weights of diverse organs (Figure S6C–S6D, respectively). Moreover, chronic treatment with 
DHAA had no obvious effect on the mouse gut microbiome, as evidenced by an unaltered 
total DNA amount extracted from bacteria in mouse feces, suggesting no change in total 
bacterial number in the mouse gut (Figure S6E), and by altered proportions but no loss of 
any components of the gut microbiota (Figure S6F). DHAA treatment did not alter complete 
blood counts (CBC) or hematopoietic properties in representative A375 xenograft mice 
compared to the water-treated group (Table S1). These results together suggest that DHAA 
treatment does not cause obvious toxicity in vivo.
Further studies revealed that the inhibitory effect of DHAA treatment on tumor growth 
potential of A375 cells in xenograft mice was not reversed by intraperitoneal injection with 
acetoacetate (Figure 6G), despite increased serum levels of acetoacetate in DHAA-treated 
mice receiving acetoacetate injection (Figure 6H). DHAA treatment did not affect serum 
levels of 3HB, cholesterol or glucose in mice in the presence or absence of acetoacetate 
injection (Figures 6I–6J, S6G, respectively). Consistently, acetoacetate injection did not

 reverse the inhibitory effects of DHAA on phosphorylation of MEK1 and ERK1/2 (Figure 
6K), BRAF V600E-MEK1 binding (Figure 6L) or cell proliferation rates assessed by IHC 
staining of Ki67 (Figures 6M and S6H) in tumors derived from A375 cells in mice. These 
data are consistent with previous results (Figures 5D–5E, S5C, 5I) showing that acetoacetate 
was insufficient to reverse the effect of DHAA on BRAF V600E-expressing cells.
DHAA reverses effect of dietary fat on BRAF V600E tumor growth
Consistent with our findings presented above, we found that treatment with a high-fat diet 
promoted, while DHAA alone inhibited, tumor growth rates, sizes and masses in nude mice 
with BRAF V600E-expressing A2058 or A375 cell xenografts, whereas co-treatment with 
DHAA effectively reversed the enhanced tumor growth potential of A2058 or A375 cells in 
xenograft mice fed with a high-fat diet (Figures 7A and S7A). A high-fat diet in the presence 
or absence of DHAA treatment did not affect body weight (Figure S7B). Although DHAA 
treatment had no effect on serum levels of acetoacetate, cholesterol, glucose or 3HB levels in 
mice fed with high-fat or normal foods (Figures 7B–7C and S7C–S7D, respectively), DHAA 
significantly attenuated the high-fat diet-dependent enhancement of phosphorylation of 
MEK1 and ERK1/2 (Figure 7D), BRAF V600E-MEK1 binding (Figure 7E), and cell 
proliferation rates assessed by IHC staining of Ki67 (Figures 7F and S7E) in tumors derived 
from A2058 and A375 cells. These results suggest that dietary fat likely promotes BRAF 
V600E tumor growth through regulation of serum levels of acetoacetate in vivo.
DISCUSSION
These findings reveal a pathologic link between a dietary component and specific oncogenic 
mutations that occur in human cancers, where the selective effect of dietary fat on BRAF 
V600E tumor growth is mediated through elevated ketogenesis and consequently increased 
circulating levels of acetoacetate. These studies provide insights into development of a 
concept that, by analogy to precision medicine, we term the “precision diet”, which is 
designed based on individual genetic background to lower cancer risk and provide cancer 
prevention. Thus, deciphering the molecular mechanisms by which certain dietary factors 
fuel cancer risk and disease development in patients with particular genetic alterations has 
highly impactful clinical significance. Furthermore, limiting dietary fat intake and 
monitoring circulating acetoacetate levels might be beneficial in patients with BRAF V600E 
melanoma or other related cancers and in individuals with BRAF V600E-positive 
premalignant lesions. In addition, it is plausible that lipid lowering agents may have a role in 
cancer prevention and/or supplemental treatment approaches to reduce cancer progression 
and/or improve clinical outcome in both the BRAF V600E-positive pre-malignancy and 
cancer settings. Obesity has been associated with an increased risk of malignant melanoma, 
which is approximately twice that in non-obese individuals, and worsens prognosis of 
malignant melanoma in diverse epidemiological and clinical studies (Amjadi et al., 2011; 
Antoniadis et al., 2011; Brandon et al., 2009; Chen et al., 2013; Dennis et al., 2008; 
Kirkpatrick et al., 1994; Oh et al., 2005; Pandey et al., 2012; Sergentanis et al., 2013; Shors 
et al., 2001). A recent study also links fat mass and obesity-associated (FTO), a gene 
associated with obesity and overeating, with an increased risk of malignant melanoma (Iles 
et al., 2013). Interestingly, Sergentanis et al reported that a 31% increased risk of malignant

 melanoma was observed among overweight and obese men, whereas no significant changes 
were observed for obese women (Sergentanis et al., 2013). However, none of these studies 
was controlled for BRAF V600E mutational status of individuals. Higher-order associations 
between obesity and risk of BRAF V600E-positive malignant melanoma should be 
addressed and examined by future studies.
Interestingly, changes of circulating acetoacetate at sub-millimolar levels are sufficient to 
alter BRAF V600E tumor growth in vivo, whereas acetoacetate treatment in millimolar level 
is required to promote cell proliferation of cultured BRAF V600E tumor cells in vitro. Such 
response disparity might be due to that, in the in vitro cell proliferation assay, cells are 
cultured in complete media with various growth factors and abundant nutrients that provide 
an optimized culture condition for cells to achieve almost maximized cell proliferation 
potential, whereas cells in growing tumors likely are not provided with such optimized 
conditions. This might explain why the cultured cells are less sensitive to acetoacetate 
treatment in terms of enhanced cell proliferation. Moreover, tumor formation and growth in 
animals at the whole organism level are complex processes not just involving cell 
proliferation potential, so it is possible that other related processes including, for example, 
tumorigenesis and angiogenesis might be more sensitive to the change of circulating 
acetoacetate level.
Hymeglusin (Skaff et al., 2012; Tomoda et al., 2004) and 3-hydroxyglutaryl-CoA (Fu et al., 
2010) have been reported as inhibitors of two key ketogenic enzymes, HMG-CoA synthase 
(HMGCS) and HMGCL, respectively. Future anti-ketogenic drugs such as small molecule 
inhibitors of HMGCS and HMGCL, as well as DHAA and its next generation derivatives 
may represent alternative clinical treatments for patients with BRAF V600E-positive cancer. 
Although DHAA as a synthetic compound has been safely used as a fungicide and 
bactericide (Stedman et al., 1954), inhibition of ketogenesis and/or acetoacetate function 
may affect organs including the heart and brain that use ketone bodies including acetoacetate 
and 3HB for energy during fasting (Cotter et al., 2013; Morris, 2005). In addition, targeting 
HMGCL may cause side effects similar to the symptoms observed in patients with HMGCL 
deficiency (HMGCLD), which is caused by mutations in the HMGCL gene and represents a 
rare autosomal recessive inborn disease seen in infant patients during the first year of their 
life. The disease is characterized by metabolism errors including disruption of ketogenesis 
and L-leucine catabolism with acute clinical symptoms such as vomiting, seizures, 
metabolic acidosis, hypoketotic hypoglycemia, and lethargy (Menao et al., 2009). These 
concerns warrant further detailed toxicity and pharmacokinetics studies to evaluate potential 
anti-ketogenic or anti-acetoacetate therapies in clinical BRAF V600E-positive cancer 
treatment.
Our study also raises additional questions. For example, most foods contain several different 
kinds of fat. It is crucial to determine which type(s) of dietary fat are essential for 
ketogenesis and in particular acetoacetate production, and may be considered harmful 
dietary fats that should be eliminated from the diet of individuals with BRAF V600E-
positive cancer or pre-malignancy. In addition, these mouse studies were performed within a 
relatively short time of less than 5 weeks. Future studies are warranted to examine the 
potential long term effects of treatments with high fat diet, ketone bodies, lipid lowering

 agents, or DHAA on tumor growth potential of BRAF V600E positive and negative tumor 
cells in vivo. Interestingly, high-fat diet induced an increase in serum concentrations of 3HB 
in C57BL/6 mice ((Kennedy et al., 2007) and Figure S7F), whereas high-fat diet did not 
significantly affect serum concentrations of 3HB in Balb/c nude mice (Figure S7F). These 
data suggested that different mouse strains respond differently to the high-fat diet in terms of 
serum 3HB levels, which is likely due to the relatively low basal levels of serum 3HB in 
C57BL/6 mice prior to high fat food treatment, and that the basal level of serum 3HB in 
Balb/c nude mice may already represent a maximum physiological level for mice (Figure 
S7F). Future studies are warranted to include consideration of species and strain difference.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Thermal melt shift assays
The thermal melt shift assay was performed as previously described (Hitosugi et al., 2012). 
In brief, thermal shift assay of compound (DHAA)-protein (BRAF WT or BRAF V600E) 
interaction was performed in 96-well PCR plates with various compound concentrations and 
200 µg/ml protein in a buffer solution (20 mM Tris, 100 mM NaCl, pH 7.4). SYPRO orange 
was used as a dye to monitor the fluorescence change at 610 nm. DHAA was dissolved in 
double distilled water and added to the protein solution. The cellular thermal shift assay was 
performed as previously described (Martinez Molina et al., 2013). Briefly, 293T cells were 
transfected with FLAG-BRAF-WT or V600E mutant. After 24 h, cells were collected, 
resuspended in TBS and lysed with three cycles of freeze-thaw using dry ice/ethanol slurry. 
The soluble fraction was separated by centrifugation at 18,000g for 20 min. The cell lysates 
were then incubated with vehicle control, AA (400 µM) or DHAA (400 µM) for 15 min at 
room temperature. Subsequently, the lysates were aliquoted into 9 PCR tubes and heated at 
46, 49, 52, 55, 58, 61, 64, 67 and 70°C for 3 min. The precipitated proteins were removed by 
centrifugation at 18,000g for 20 min and the soluble proteins were subjected to Western blot 
analysis.
14C-acetoacetate and BRAF binding assay
Purified recombinant BRAF protein variants were pre-bound with FLAG-beads, followed by 
incubating with the indicated concentrations of 14C-labeled acetoacetate (American 
Radiolabeled Chemicals) in 1xTBS (50 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.5) buffer for 4 h at 
4°C. The appropriate amount of DHAA as previously described was then added into the 
reaction mixture to incubate for another 4 h at 4°C. Alternatively, bead-bound BRAF protein 
variants were incubated first with the indicated concentrations of DHAA in 1xTBS buffer 
for 4 h at 4°C, then the appropriate amount of 14C-labeled acetoacetate as previously 
described was added into the reaction mixture to incubate for another 4 h at 4°C. The beads 
were then washed and bead-bound BRAF proteins were eluted by incubating with 10 µg 
3xFLAG peptides (Sigma-Aldrich) for 1 h. Radioactive signals of BRAF-bound 14C-labeled 
acetoacetate were detected by liquid scintillation counting. Kd values were calculated using 
GraphPad Prism Software. For measurement of Ki of DHAA to BRAF in the presence 
of 14C-acetoacetate. Bead-bound FLAG-BRAF variants were incubated with 300 µM 14C-
acetoacetate in TBS buffer for 4 h at 4°C, followed by further incubation with 0, 10, 20, 50, 
100, 200, 500, 1000 µM DHAA for another 4 h at 4°C after unbound 14C-acetoacetate was

 washed off. The bead-bound BRAF proteins were eluted with 10 µg FLAG peptides and the 
radioactivity of retained 14C-acetoacetate on BRAF variants was detected by liquid 
scintillation counting. Ki values were calculated using GraphPad Prism Software.
Animal models
The design and conduct of all experiments using mice was approved by the Institutional 
Animal Care and Use Committee of Emory University. For xenograft studies, nude mice 
(nu/nu, female 4–6-week-old, Harlan Laboratories) were subcutaneously injected with 
1×106 melanoma cells on the flank. Tumor growth was recorded every two days from one 
week after inoculation by measurement of two perpendicular diameters using the formula 
4π/3 x (width/2)2 x (length/2). Mice were sacrificed ~4 weeks after inoculation. The masses 
of tumors (g) derived from treatments were compared. Statistical analyses were performed 
by comparison in relation to the control group with a two-tailed paired Student’s t test. Mice 
in the high-fat diet group started receiving paste high-fat diet (Bio serv F3666) or solid high-
fat diet (Research Diets D12369B) one week before tumor cell inoculation and continued to 
receive the diet until the experimental endpoint. Mice in the control group received standard 
rodent diet (LabDiet 5015).
The amount of solid high-fat diet and standard diet consumed by mice was recorded by 
weighing the food mass. Body weights of mice were recorded weekly. AA (100mg/kg/day), 
3HB (100mg/kg/day), DHAA (200mg/kg/day) and LiCl (42mg/kg/day) were injected into 
mice intraperitoneally daily beginning on the day of tumor inoculation. Lipid lowering 
agents (fenofibrate (200mg/kg/day), niacin (200mg/kg/day), or fluvastatin (40mg/kg/day)) 
were given to mice by oral gavage beginning on the day of tumor inoculation and AA 
(100mg/kg/day) was intraperitoneally injected beginning on the same day. For gut 
microbiome analysis, nude mice were injected with DHAA (200mg/kg/day) for 4 weeks 
before feces collection. Feces from each mouse in the same cage were collected and mixed 
as one sample. ~100mg feces from each cage were sent to GENEWIZ company for 16S 
rRNA sequencing and gut microbiome analysis.
Measurements of acetoacetate, 3HB, cholesterol, glucose and triglyceride
Acetoacetate levels in mouse serum and urine samples and tumor lysates were measured 
using the Acetoacetate Colorimetric Assay Kit (BioVision) following the manufacturer’s 
instructions. In brief, serum, urine or tumor lysates were incubated with acetoacetate 
substrate at room temperature for 10 minutes. The alteration in absorbance (OD550) was 
measured in a kinetic mode. 3HB levels in mouse serum and urine samples were measured 
using the Ketone Body Assay Kit (Abnova) following the manufacturer’s instructions. In 
brief, serum, urine or tumor lysates were incubated with cholesterol esterase, probe and 
enzyme mix provided in the kit for 60 minutes at 37 °C in dark. Alteration in absorbance at 
OD570 was measured. For cholesterol assay, total cholesterol levels in mouse serum samples 
were measured using the Total Cholesterol and Cholesteryl Ester Colorimetric/Fluorometric 
Assay Kit (Biovision) following the manufacturer’s instructions. In brief, serum samples 
were incubated with cholesterol esterase, probe and enzyme mix provided in the kit for 60 
minutes at 37 °C in dark. Alteration in absorbance at OD570 was measured. Glucose levels 
in mouse serum samples were measured using the Glucose Colorimetric/Fluorometric Assay

 Kit (Biovision) following the manufacturer’s instructions. In brief, serum samples were 
incubated with glucose probe and enzyme mix provided in the kit for 30 minutes at 37 °C in 
dark. Alteration in absorbance at OD570 was measured. Triglyceride levels in mouse serum 
samples were measured using the Triglyceride Quantification Colorimetric/Fluorometric Kit 
(Biovision) following the manufacturer’s instructions. In brief, serum samples were pre-
incubated with lipase at room temperature for 20 minutes in dark. Then triglyceride probe 
and enzyme mix provided in the kit were added and incubated for 60 minutes at room 
temperature in dark. Alteration in absorbance at OD570 was measured.
