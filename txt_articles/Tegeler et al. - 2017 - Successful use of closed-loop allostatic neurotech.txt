Abstract
Background: Military-related post-traumatic stress (PTS) is associated with numerous symptom clusters and
diminished autonomic cardiovascular regulation. High-resolution, relational, resonance-based, electroencephalic
mirroring (HIRREM®) is a noninvasive, closed-loop, allostatic, acoustic stimulation neurotechnology that produces
real-time translation of dominant brain frequencies into audible tones of variable pitch and timing to support the
auto-calibration of neural oscillations. We report clinical, autonomic, and functional effects after the use of HIRREM®
for symptoms of military-related PTS.
Methods: Eighteen service members or recent veterans (15 active-duty, 3 veterans, most from special operations, 1
female), with a mean age of 40.9 (SD = 6.9) years and symptoms of PTS lasting from 1 to 25 years, undertook 19.5
(SD = 1.1) sessions over 12 days. Inventories for symptoms of PTS (Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist – Military
version, PCL-M), insomnia (Insomnia Severity Index, ISI), depression (Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression
Scale, CES-D), and anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale, GAD-7) were collected before (Visit 1, V1),
immediately after (Visit 2, V2), and at 1 month (Visit 3, V3), 3 (Visit 4, V4), and 6 (Visit 5, V5) months after intervention
completion. Other measures only taken at V1 and V2 included blood pressure and heart rate recordings to analyze
heart rate variability (HRV) and baroreflex sensitivity (BRS), functional performance (reaction and grip strength)
testing, blood and saliva for biomarkers of stress and inflammation, and blood for epigenetic testing. Paired t-tests,
Wilcoxon signed-rank tests, and a repeated-measures ANOVA were performed.
Results: Clinically relevant, significant reductions in all symptom scores were observed at V2, with durability
through V5. There were significant improvements in multiple measures of HRV and BRS [Standard deviation of the
normal beat to normal beat interval (SDNN), root mean square of the successive differences (rMSSD), high
frequency (HF), low frequency (LF), and total power, HF alpha, sequence all, and systolic, diastolic and mean arterial
pressure] as well as reaction testing. Trends were seen for improved grip strength and a reduction in C-Reactive
Protein (CRP), Angiotensin II to Angiotensin 1–7 ratio and Interleukin-10, with no change in DNA n-methylation.
There were no dropouts or adverse events reported.

Conclusions: Service members or veterans showed reductions in symptomatology of PTS, insomnia, depressive
mood, and anxiety that were durable through 6 months after the use of a closed-loop allostatic neurotechnology
for the auto-calibration of neural oscillations. This study is the first to report increased HRV or BRS after the use of
an intervention for service members or veterans with PTS. Ongoing investigations are strongly warranted.

Background
Advanced understanding and treatment for post-traumatic
stress disorder (PTSD) will require a paradigm that appreci-
ates its complexity and holds a promising solution for its ex-
tensive
burden
of
suffering.
Conventionally,
PTSD
is
classified and treated as a behavioral disturbance that can fol-
low a traumatic event, and its main symptom clusters pertain
to re-experiencing the trauma, avoidance and generalized
numbing, negative cognitions and mood, and heightened
arousal [1]. However, while military service members with
PTSD are beset with increased psychosocial risks, including
compromised role functions [2], substance abuse [3], and
suicidality [4], studies also show an increased risk for cardio-
vascular and metabolic diseases [5, 6] as well as all-cause
mortality [7]. Care for individuals with traumatic stress
symptomatology should thus entail attention to both behav-
ioral and physical health status. Moreover, although therapies
based on re-exposure to trauma have been designated as
evidence-based treatments [8], there is concern about high
dropout rates associated with this approach [9], as well as a
lack of impact on sleep disturbances [10]. In addition, despite
the undeniable suffering of American veterans of the
Vietnam War, which contributed to recognition of PTSD as
a Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders
(DSM) clinical disorder, there are also concerns that the
medicalization of combat-related stress can lead to unhelpful
consequences related to stigmatization [11, 12].
To improve modeling of PTSD (or post-traumatic
stress, PTS, more broadly), a promising starting point
may be the recognition of the brain as the organ of cen-
tral command. The physiological paradigm of allostasis
(stability through change) notes that the brain directs set
points for biological function on the basis of perceived
needs for organism-level survival [13, 14]. Stated another
way, it is the brain that lets environmental stressors “get
under the skin” [15]. Within the allostasis paradigm, the
sympathetic and parasympathetic divisions of the auto-
nomic nervous system serve as principal pathways for
bidirectional communication and coordination between
the brain and peripheral physiology. For example, in the
setting of an acute threat, the brain orchestrates these
divisions to affect an instantaneous redirection of meta-
bolic resources away from the anabolic process of
digestion toward the catabolic process of mobilization.
Allostasis thus fully predicts that over time, exposure to
traumatic stresses is likely to entail both behavioral and
physical health disturbances. For therapeutics, allostasis
points to the potential for multi-system symptom reduc-
tion through interventions that are expressly designed to
facilitate the brain’s role as the organ of central com-
mand [16]. Moreover, through its emphasis on context-
dependent heightened stress responsivity, the allostasis
paradigm
supports
destigmatization
of
PTS-related
phenomenology. There is no single normal mode of
brain function; rather, there are ranges for set points
[17] that are subject to modification based on neuroplas-
ticity. The functional set point for a given capacity—vigi-
lance,
for
example—may
or
may
not
be
adaptive
(“pathological”), depending on the environment.
Given its crucial and distributed role for connecting
the brain, body, and behavior, the autonomic nervous
system merits special attention in the allostasis para-
digm. Autonomic regulation of the cardiovascular sys-
tem can be characterized by measuring heart rate
variability (HRV) and baroreflex sensitivity (BRS). HRV
and BRS indicate the physiological capacity to produce
dynamically varied responses to the changing needs of
an environment, and prospective studies show that de-
creased HRV is a risk factor for incident cardiovascular
disease [18] and all-cause mortality [19]. Furthermore,
depressed HRV is seen generally across behavioral disor-
ders [20], specifically in military personnel and veterans
with diagnosed PTSD [21–25], and as a pre-deployment
predictor of new post-deployment PTSD diagnoses or
symptom severity [26, 27].
An open question in studies of PTS and autonomic
dysregulation pertains to how or why HRV is depressed
in persons who have been exposed to traumatic stress.
An epigenetic and neural oscillatory explanation is pro-
vided by the bihemispheric autonomic model (BHAM)
[28]. The BHAM begins by recognizing that there is
hemispheric lateralization in the management of the
autonomic nervous system, with the right and left sides
having primary responsibility for the sympathetic and
parasympathetic divisions, respectively. The BHAM pro-
poses that trauma-related sympathetic hyperarousal may
Tegeler et al. Military Medical Research  (2017) 4:38 
Page 2 of 11
 be an expression of maladaptive right temporal lobe
activity, whereas the avoidant and dissociative features
of the traumatic stress response may be indicators of
a parasympathetic “freeze” response that is signifi-
cantly driven by the left temporal lobe. An implica-
tion of the BHAM is that a successful allostatic (i.e.,
brain-based, top-down) intervention may facilitate the
reduction of symptom clusters associated with auto-
nomic disturbances through the mitigation of mal-
adaptive asymmetries.
The objective of this report is to document changes
in self-reported symptoms, autonomic, and functional
measures after use of a closed-loop acoustic stimulation
neurotechnology by a series of active duty service mem-
bers or recent veterans with military-related symptoms of
traumatic stress. The neurotechnology strategy (HIR-
REM®; Brain State Technologies, Scottsdale, Arizona) is
aligned with the allostasis paradigm through its brain-
focused
strategy
for
the
auto-calibration
of
neural
oscillations [16]; through its attention to hemispheric
asymmetry, it is also designed to leverage insights de-
scribed in the BHAM. We hypothesized that use of the
neurotechnology would be followed by reductions in self-
reported PTSD-related symptomatology as well as im-
provements in HRV and BRS. For a subset of the initial
subjects,
we also conducted exploratory analysis of
changes in biochemical and epigenetic markers related to
stress or inflammation. Changes in brain network con-
nectivity demonstrated through analysis of whole brain,
resting-state magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) evalua-
tions are reported elsewhere [29, 30].
Methods
Population and subject recruitment
This single site, ongoing, IRB-approved pilot study
(Clinicaltrials.gov registration NCT0323089), is being
carried out in the Department of Neurology at the
Wake
Forest
School
of
Medicine,
Winston-Salem,
North Carolina, USA. Initial eligibility screening is
conducted through an online questionnaire followed
by a phone conversation. To be considered for inclu-
sion, individuals must be active duty military service
members or recent veterans with service since 2001
with symptoms of military-related traumatic stress, in-
cluding insomnia, poor concentration, sadness, irrit-
ability, or hyper-alertness, with or without a history
of traumatic brain injury (TBI). Participants are re-
quired to have either a formal diagnosis of PTSD, a
referral from a military medical provider confirming
active PTS symptoms, or prior or current treatment for the
same. For those participants who are special operations ser-
vice members, the study deliberately does not use a symp-
tom inventory threshold score as an eligibility criterion
because of the under-reporting of symptoms among these
individuals (personal communication, Naval Special War-
fare medical officer). If contact is established through self-
referral with the absence of a formal PTSD diagnosis, a
score of 50 points on a screening PCL-M is required. Po-
tential participants have been identified by referrals from
military medical providers, as well as the Care Coalition
and Preservation of the Force and Family, which both sup-
port the special operations community of the United States
Armed Forces. Several participants have joined through
self-referral after word of mouth from other participants or
review of open studies on the research program webpage
on the Wake Forest Baptist Health website. Based on advice
from military personnel and recognition that the potential
stigma associated with a diagnosis of PTSD might limit re-
cruitment, study flyers and related materials focused on
symptoms and did not include use of the term “PTSD.”
Exclusion criteria are the inability to provide in-
formed consent, inability to attend all study visits or
sit comfortably in a chair, bilateral total hearing loss,
known seizure disorder, or an ongoing need for the
use
of
benzodiazepines,
opiates,
anti-psychotic
medications, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor
(SSRIs) or selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibi-
tor (SNRIs), prescribed sleep medications including
zolpidem or eszopiclone, stimulant medication, or
thyroid hormones. Those with ongoing or anticipated
regular use of recreational drugs, alcohol, or energy
drinks during the intervention and in the 4 weeks
following intervention completion or a lack of inter-
net or smart phone access were also excluded. With
the knowledge of and under the direct management
of their medical provider, participants could titrate
off what would otherwise have been considered ex-
clusionary
medications
or
recreational
substances
prior to enrollment.
Intervention schedule
Beginning on a Monday morning, and following in-
formed consent, baseline (Visit 1, V1) outcome measures
are collected (details below), including self-reported
symptom inventories, physiological and functional mea-
sures, an assessment of brain electrical activity, blood
and saliva samples for biomarkers or epigenetic testing,
and a whole brain, resting-state MRI scan. Participants
then receive a series of closed-loop acoustic stimulation
sessions (HIRREM) over a period of 12 days. The initial
two sessions are given on the afternoon of the first day
following the completion of all baseline data collections.
Thereafter, participants receive two sessions daily, with a
break between sessions. Typically, no sessions are given
on Saturday (day 6), many receive a single afternoon
session on Sunday (day 7), with a final, single morning
session on the second Friday (day 12), prior to the re-
peated outcome measures.

 All outcome measures are repeated prior to departure
on day 12 (Visit 2, V2), except that for scheduling pur-
poses and to ensure similar time of day of sampling,
blood and saliva collection followed the morning session
on day 11. Symptom inventories are collected remotely
via online surveys at 1, 3, and 6 months following inter-
vention completion (V3, V4, V5, respectively). Brief
informal interviews are conducted with participants in
person
during
V2
data
collection,
and
narrative
comments are sought at subsequent data collections by
either phone or email.

Criteria B, C, and D for PTSD symptoms based on
traumatic life experiences related to military service
[31]. Seventeen items are rated on a Likert scale with
a composite score range of 17 to 85. A score of 50
or higher is correlated with a probability of military-
related PTSD [32], although cutoff scores as low as
30 to 34 have been suggested for active-duty soldiers
seen in primary care populations [33]. A reduction of
≥ 10 points in the PCL-M has been suggested to be a
clinically
significant
change
[34].
The
Insomnia
Severity Index [35] is a 7-question measure, with
responses from 0 to 4 for each question, that yields
scores ranging from 0 to 28. A score of 15 or greater
is considered to indicate moderate or greater insom-
nia severity, and 8 to 14 indicates subthreshold in-
somnia. A reduction of at least 6 to 7 points has
been suggested as the minimally important clinical
difference for insomnia symptom reduction [36, 37].
The
Center
for
Epidemiologic
Studies
Depression
Scale (CES-D) [38] is a 20-item survey assessing
affective depressive symptomatology to screen for the
risk of depression. Scores range from 0 to 60, and a
score of 16 or greater is commonly used as a clinic-
ally relevant cut-off [39]. The Generalized Anxiety
Disorder 7-item scale (GAD-7) [40] is a seven-item
screening tool for anxiety that is widely used in
primary care. The clinical threshold to consider treat-
ment is 8, and a statistically reliable change is 4 or
greater. Subjects with a history of mild traumatic
brain injury or concussion also complete the Rivermead
Post-Concussion Questionnaire [41], a 16-item survey
that assesses the severity of common post-concussion
symptoms on a scale of 0 to 4, with a total score range
from 0 to 64 (least to highest symptom severity).
Autonomic cardiovascular regulation
Continuous recordings of blood pressure (BP) and
heart rate (HR) are obtained from noninvasive finger
arterial pressure measurements and electrocardiogram
for 10 min with subjects resting supine and breathing
freely. These recordings follow the completion of the
symptom inventories and functional testing. Systolic,
diastolic, and mean arterial BP, as well as beat-to-beat

Acknowledge 4.2 software, Santa Barbara, CA) at
1000 Hz are analyzed using Nevrokard SA-BRS soft-
ware (by Nevrokard Kiauta, d.o.o., Izola, Slovenia). All
recordings are visually inspected, and the first 5 min
of
usable
tracings
are
analyzed.
Recordings
with
dropped beats or gross motion artifacts are excluded
from analysis. Assessments included multiple mea-
sures of heartrate variability (HRV) in both time and
frequency domains, baroreflex sensitivity (BRS), and
blood pressure [42].
Functional testing
Reaction testing uses a drop-stick, clinical reaction
time apparatus. It is constructed from a meter stick
covered in friction tape with gradations. The modified
meter stick is fixed to a weighted rubber cylinder.
The apparatus is placed between the thumb and index
finger of the subject and released at a random time
during a countdown. The subject catches the appar-
atus

(Baseline

Hand Dynamometer). The greatest force generated
during three trials is used for analysis [44].
Biomarkers of stress and inflammation and epigenetic
measures
During the study, funding became available to permit
limited
exploratory
analysis
of
post-interventional
changes in markers of stress and inflammation in 15
subjects and for epigenetic measures in 8 subjects.
Blood-based measures included Angiotensin II (Ang II),
Angiotensin 1 to 7 (Ang 1–7), epinephrine, norepineph-
rine, C-reactive protein (CRP), vasopressin, Interleukin 1
(IL-1), Interleukin 6 (IL-6), and Interleukin 10 (IL-10),
and saliva measures included cortisol and alpha-amylase.
For epigenetic testing, DNA was isolated from whole
blood samples to quantify DNA methylation at each site.
Microarray assays were used to determine the methyla-
tion proportion for each site (beta value) based on the
ratio of the fluorescence intensity of the methylated ver-
sus the combined methylated and unmethylated probes.

 Closed-loop allostatic neurotechnology intervention
The process and procedures for the provision of closed-
loop allostatic neurotechnology by a technologist in an
office setting have been discussed in detail previously
[16]. An initial assessment of brain electrical activity en-
tails two-channel recordings from at least 6 paired loca-
tions on the scalp (F3/F4, C3/C4, T3/T4, P3/P4, FZ/OZ,
O1/O2; also, typically FP1/FP2 and CB1/CB2) with the
participant at rest and while carrying out a task, using
sensors and amplifiers that sample at 256 Hz. At each
scalp location, data are recorded for 1 minute each with
eyes closed, eyes partially open as a transitional state of
arousal, and eyes open while carrying out a specific
mental task (e.g., reading numbers or performing mental
calculations). Trained technologists evaluate assessment
data to choose protocols for the initial intervention
session.
Protocols for each session include recording brain
electrical activity through, generally, two channels, with
scalp sensors placed at homologous regions of the hemi-
spheres according to the 10–20 International EEG
system. Software algorithms analyze specific ranges of
the brain electrical frequency spectrum in real time,
identify dominant frequencies based on proprietary
mathematical formulae, and translate those frequencies
into acoustic stimuli (audible tones of variable pitch and
timing) which are presented to participants through
standard earphones (Creative EP-630 or Sony Stereo
Headphones MDR-EX58V) with as little as an eight-
millisecond delay. Volume (decibels) of acoustic stimula-
tion is adjusted for each participant in accordance with
their preference.
Each session (typically 90–180 min each) consists of 4
to 10 protocols, ranging from 5 to 40 min per protocol,
and each is intended to address a specific anatomical lo-
cation and frequency range. Some protocols are com-
pleted with eyes closed and some with eyes open, with
the participant being asked to relax while sitting or
reclining comfortably in a zero-gravity chair. After the
initial session, specific protocols and protocol durations
for successive sessions are chosen based on brain
electrical data from the participant’s preceding session,
which, for purposes of technologist review, are aggre-
gated in broad-band frequency ranges (< 1.0 Hz; 1.0–
3.0 Hz; 3.0–5.5 Hz; 5.5–7.5 Hz; 7.5–10.0 Hz; 10.0–
12.0 Hz; 12.0–15.0 Hz; 15.0–23.0 Hz; 23.0–36.0 Hz;
36.0–48.0 Hz). Special attention is given to activity set
points suggestive of dominant hemispheric asymmetries
and/or suboptimal ratios of energy across the frequency
spectrum. Algorithms are designed to support the de-
establishment of
relatively
invariant
and potentially
maladaptive activity patterns. All participants continued
with their current medical or behavioral care being used
at the time of enrollment.
Although exact mechanisms await confirmation, it
appears that with rapid updates regarding its own elec-
trical activity, intended to support frequency-matching
or resonance between the acoustic stimulation and oscil-
lating brain networks, the brain is supported towards
auto-calibration and self-optimization. As a closed-loop
process, no conscious or cognitive activity is required,
yet the brain pattern is observed to shift on its own
terms towards improved balance and, often, reduced
hyperarousal.
Statistical analysis
A repeated-measures ANOVA was performed to evalu-
ate changes in symptom inventory scores between base-
line and each follow-up visit. For other comparisons,
two-tailed paired t-tests were performed to evaluate pre-
to
post-HIRREM
changes.
In
consideration
of
the
sample size, the non-parametric Wilcoxon signed-rank
test was used to corroborate the t-test findings. Analyses
were performed using SAS (Cary, NC).
Results
Twenty-seven individuals were screened, and 18 met eli-
gibility criteria, provided informed consent, and enrolled
in the study. Of the 9 who were excluded, 7 had sched-
ule or training cycle conflicts that did not permit travel
to the study site, and 2 did not meet criteria with respect
to a formal diagnosis of PTSD, active symptoms, or
treatment of PTS. The mean age of the cohort was 40.9
(SD 6.9) years. There were 17 men, and the cohort was
largely Caucasian (17 Caucasian, 1 Asian). Three recent
veterans were enrolled, while the other 15 participants
were on active duty. Self-reported health conditions are
listed in Table 1, and therapies previously used for PTS
symptom remediation are listed in Table 2. Of the 11 in-
dividuals who reported previous use of a psychoactive or
sleep-related medication, 10 had made recent adjust-
ments to their regimen (withholding or discontinuing a
medication that would entail exclusion) under the guid-
ance of their medical provider. Participants received a
mean of 19.5 (SD 1.1) HIRREM sessions, with 2779 min
(SD 315) of protocol time, over the 12-day intervention
period. There were no adverse events and no drop-outs.
One participant temporarily returned to his military base
midway through the intervention period to be closer to
his social support network and to address some active-
duty
responsibilities.
Nine
HIRREM
sessions
were
provided to him by one of the study investigators (CLT)
at his location using a mobile configuration of the HIR-
REM intervention (laptop instead of desktop computer).

 their experience with the study during and after the
intervention.
Symptom scores for PTSD, insomnia, depressive mood,
and anxiety are shown in Fig. 1. Through the first two
follow-up visits, 83% of subjects reported PCL-M scores
that were at least 10 points lower than their baseline (at
V2, 9 of the subjects reported reductions of at least 10
points on their PCL-M, and at V3, an additional 6 re-
ported reductions of at least 10 points compared to their
V1 score). Over the same visits, 78% of subjects reported
ISI scores that were at least 7 points lower than their base-
line (seven subjects at V2 and an additional 7 subjects at
V3). For the 15 individuals with a history of TBI or con-
cussion, there were also durable reductions in concussion-
related symptomatology (V2 RPQ -11.8, SD 14.1, P < 0.01,
subsequent visits not shown). Figures 2 and 3 show V1
and V2 values of HRV, BRS, and blood pressure measures.
V1 and V2 values are also shown for grip strength (Fig. 4)
and reaction testing (Figure 5). Of the biochemical mea-
sures that were assessed, there were trends for reductions
in C-reactive protein (−37%, P = 0.06), angiotensin II to
angiotensin 1–7 ratio (−24%, P = 0.19), and IL-10 (−12%,
P = 0.14). Epigenetic markers showed no statistically sig-
nificant changes.
Discussion
This report documents outcomes for a series of active-
duty military service members and veterans with symp-
toms
of
military-related
PTS,
predominantly
special
operations warfighters or support personnel, who partici-
pated in the use of a closed-loop, allostatic, acoustic
stimulation neurotechnology. On average, there were
robust and durable reductions in the symptoms of PTS,
insomnia, depressive mood, and anxiety. At the first post-
intervention data collection, there were marked increases
in HRV and BRS, and there were trends for improvements
in physical functional performance and markers of stress
or inflammation. There were no adverse events, and all
participants completed their course of intervention ses-
sions along with all follow-up data collections.
The present findings are consistent with outcomes
reported
after
the
use
of
closed-loop
allostatic
neurotechnology by civilians with self-reported PTS,
who were mostly women with non-military trauma
[45] or athletes with sports-related concussions [46].
Together, these studies concur with the idea that real-
time monitoring and modulation of brain activity (closed-
loop strategies) can support advanced remediation of
neurological and psychiatric disorders, sleep enhancement
and, potentially, performance optimization [47–50]. The
authors are aware of only two other studies that have re-
ported quantitative HRV effects after the use of any type
of intervention by military personnel or veterans with
PTSD. HRV decreased with the use of escitalopram [51]

 and showed no change after the use of mindfulness medi-
tation [52].
Limitations to the generalizability of these findings
include the modest sample size and the absence of a
control group. Improvements in reaction testing may
have been related to practice effects, which have been
documented with the drop-stick procedure [53]. The
use of numerous types of psychoactive medications,
as well as alcohol or recreational drugs, was an exclu-
sion to enrollment, and it is unknown how these
co-interventions or influences might affect the out-
comes of future studies. Although the improvements
demonstrated may have been influenced by subjective
expectations, positive social interactions with study
personnel, or other “placebo” components, it seems
unlikely
that
these
non-specific
factors
were
the
fundamental drivers. HRV is an objective physiological
measure, and meta-analysis has found that placebo
effects in clinical trials tend to be limited to continu-
ous subjective outcomes [54]. In addition, the durabil-
ity

 inconsistent with the interpretation that changes were
due to statistical randomness, regression to the mean,
or natural history of disease. Given the protracted
duration of symptoms, and numerous other therapies
that had been tried previously, spontaneous recovery
over a few weeks to months would also be considered
unlikely.
Various aspects of the intervention point to its prom-
ise as an innovative modality for the remediation of the
effects of traumatic stress for active-duty military service
members, veterans, and other populations. The reduc-
tions in insomnia symptoms are noteworthy given the
intractability of sleep complaints in PTSD [55]. Sequelae
of TBI can complicate PTSD-specific interventions [56],
yet the numerous TBIs reported by the subjects did not
appear to hinder their participation, and there was a re-
duction in TBI-specific symptomatology. The noninva-
sive methodology is encouraging with respect to safety,
feasibility, and scalability considerations. Moreover, sup-
port from the US Army Research Office [57] has allowed
the development of a self-use configuration of the core
technology (Braintellect®-2; Brain State Technologies,
Scottsdale, Arizona), with sensor locations at prefrontal
and temporal scalp locations only. This device may fur-
ther facilitate the development of population-based strat-
egies
that
leverage
precision-guided,
allostatic
neurotechnology, and its standalone use has been pro-
posed as a potential strategy to enable the primary pre-
vention of PTSD through the optimization of sleep
quality [58].
Conclusions
A series of active-duty military personnel and veterans with
symptoms of military-related traumatic stress used a
closed-loop acoustic stimulation methodology to support
the auto-calibration of neural oscillations. Subsequently,
participants showed robust improvements in autonomic
cardiovascular regulation and durable reductions in PTS-
related symptomatology, including insomnia, with no
adverse events or dropouts. This study is the first to show
an increase in both HRV and BRS, which are significant in-
dicators of the capacity of the brain to exert dynamic and
adaptive regulation of peripheral physiology, following an
intervention provided to military personnel or veterans
with PTS. The composite intervention profile points to the
promise of allostatic neurotechnology for system-level PTS
management.
Ongoing
investigations
are
strongly
warranted.
