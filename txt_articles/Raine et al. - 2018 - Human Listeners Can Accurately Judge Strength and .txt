SUMMARY
Although animal vocalizations and human speech are known to communicate physical formidability,
no previous study has examined whether human listeners can assess the strength or body size of
vocalizers relative to their own, either from speech or from nonverbal vocalizations. Here, although
men tended to underestimate women’s formidability, and women to overestimate men’s, listeners
judged relative strength and height from aggressive roars and aggressive speech accurately. For
example, when judging roars, male listeners accurately identified vocalizers who were substantially
stronger than themselves in 88% of trials, and never as weaker. For male vocalizers only, roars func-
tioned to exaggerate the expression of threat compared to aggressive speech, as men were rated as
relatively stronger when producing roars. These results indicate that, like other mammals, the acoustic
structure of human aggressive vocal signals (and in particular roars) may have been selected to
communicate functional information relevant to listeners’ survival.
INTRODUCTION
In nonhuman mammals, vocal cues to body size (a proxy of physical formidability and threat potential) mediate
behavior in agonistic male-male interactions (koalas: Charlton et al., 2013b; sea lions: Charrier et al., 2011; fallow
deer: Pitcher et al., 2015; red deer: Reby et al., 2005; domestic dogs: Taylor et al., 2010). While the nonverbal
components of human speech also signal physical formidability, actual height and strength typically explain
only a small proportion of variance in listeners’ voice-based judgments of absolute height (Charlton et al.,
2013a; Ives et al., 2005; Pisanski et al., 2014a; Rendall et al., 2007; Smith and Patterson, 2005), absolute strength
(Sell et al., 2010), or relative height of two same-sex vocalizers (e.g., Charlton et al., 2013a, 2013b; Pisanski et al.,
2014a; Rendall et al., 2007). To our knowledge, the capacity of listeners to assess the formidability of a vocalizer
relative to their own, which should be particularly ecologically relevant in competitive or threatening contexts
(to decide whether to flee or fight), as well as in mate choice contexts (e.g., assortative mating preferences for
body size, Fink et al., 2007; Pawlowski, 2003), has not yet been investigated.
Here, to address this crucial shortcoming, we investigate whether listeners can estimate the strength and
height of vocalizers relative to their own from two ecologically relevant vocal signals (aggressive roars and
aggressive speech), recorded from 31 men and 30 women (see Supplemental Information for audio exam-
ples). We quantified the strength of vocalizers and listeners using a standardized amalgamated measure of
flexed bicep circumference and handgrip strength and measured height via metric tape or self-report. In
two playback experiments, we asked separate samples of listeners to estimate the strength (26 men, 19
women) or height (25 men, 31 women) of all vocalizers relative to their own for both speech types. Stimuli
were rated on a sliding 101-point scale from �50 (much weaker/shorter) to 50 (much stronger/taller) and
presented in a randomized order.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Strength did not correlate with height among either male (r = �.04, p = .833) or female (r = .083, p = .655)
vocalizers. Therefore, at least in our sample, these two physical measurements appear to characterize
distinct aspects of physical formidability.
Judgments of Relative Strength
We ran a linear mixed multinomial logistic regression with the actual strength difference between vocalizer
and listener, vocalizer sex, listener sex, and stimulus type (roar versus speech) as predictors, and included

 the relative strength difference as a categorical outcome variable. The model showed that, overall, the
actual strength difference was a significant predictor of the perceived strength difference (Table 1, entry
ii). Relatively stronger vocalizers were rated as relatively stronger, and vice versa (Figure 1). This demon-
strates that listeners of both sexes are capable of making accurate functional judgments of the strength
of other men and women, relative to their own, from both verbal and nonverbal vocal stimuli.
The model showed a significant main effect of vocalizer sex (Table 1, entry iii), with male vocalizers overall
more likely to be judged as relatively stronger than females, and vice versa, independent of the actual
strength difference between the vocalizer and listener (Figure 1). The main effects of vocalizer sex and
actual strength difference interacted significantly (Table 1, entry vi), with listeners more likely to judge rela-
tively weaker males, but relatively stronger females, as of similar strength to themselves than relatively
stronger males or weaker females (Figure 1). We also observed a significant interaction between listener
sex and actual strength difference (Table 2, entry vii). Female listeners were more likely to judge vocalizers
as stronger or of similar strength to themselves than male listeners, except when the vocalizer was much
weaker or much stronger.
The combined effects of vocalizer sex and listener sex resulted in a tendency for male listeners to under-
estimate the relative strength of female vocalizers (Figures 1A and 1C), and for female listeners to overes-
timate the relative strength of male vocalizers (Figures 1B and 1D). The significant interaction between
listener sex and vocalizer sex (Table 1, entry ix) indicated that female listeners overestimated male vocal-
izers more than expected from the combined main effects (Figure 1). Together, these results suggest that
listeners, particularly females, may overgeneralize population-level sex differences in strength (Bishop
et al., 1987; see Lassek and Gaulin, 2009 for a review). Such sex-based overgeneralizations are common
in human perception of nonverbal vocal cues (Reby et al., 2016; Rendall et al., 2007), and are likely to reflect
stereotypical biases. The stronger bias among female than male listeners is consistent with previous indi-
cations that women perceive gender differences to be larger than do men, across a wide range of psycho-
logical traits (Zell et al., 2016).

 Finally, the model revealed a significant main effect of stimulus type, showing that overall, listeners were
more likely to rate vocalizers as stronger or of similar strength to themselves when judging roars compared
to speech. A significant interaction with vocalizer sex (Table 1, entry x) indicated that this was only the case
when listeners rated male vocalizers (Figure 1). Furthermore, a three-way interaction between stimulus
type, vocalizer sex, and actual strength difference indicated that this effect was strongest when male vocal-
izers were much weaker than male listeners, and was reversed in substantially stronger female vocalizers
(Table 1, entry xiii, Figure 1). This suggests that although male roars increase the perceived difference in
strength between listeners and vocalizers, compared to aggressive speech, this difference is particularly
functional in the weakest male vocalizers. However, roaring in females does not appear to function to exag-
gerate perceived strength, and for particularly strong females, it may in fact minimize perceived strength.
Judgments of Relative Height
We ran a second linear mixed multinomial logistic regression with the actual height difference between
vocalizer and listener, vocalizer sex, listener sex, and stimulus type as predictors, and included height dif-
ference as a categorical outcome variable. The model showed that overall, the actual height difference was
a significant predictor of the perceived height difference (Table 2, entry ii). Relatively taller vocalizers were

 rated as relatively taller, and vice versa (Figure 2). This demonstrates that listeners of both sexes can judge
the body size of other men and women, relative to their own, from both verbal and nonverbal stimuli.
This effect was qualified by an interaction with listener sex, whereby male listeners were more sensitive to
relative size variation than were female listeners: as actual size differences increased, male listeners were
increasingly more likely to rate the vocalizer as relatively taller than were female listeners. These findings
support the hypothesis that size assessment abilities may have arisen primarily through male-male compe-
tition (see Puts, 2010 for additional discussion), and are consistent with previous observations that men are
better than women at estimating body size from synthesized vocal stimuli (Charlton et al., 2013a).
A significant three-way interaction between actual height difference, listener sex, and vocalizer sex indi-
cated that the effect of actual height difference was minimal when female listeners rated female vocalizers
(Figure 2D). This is consistent with evidence that male body size plays a role in female mate choice (Bruckert
et al., 2006; Sell et al., 2017).
The model showed a significant main effect of vocalizer sex (Table 2, entry iii), with male vocalizers
more likely to be judged as taller relative to the listener than female vocalizers, and vice versa, indepen-
dent of the actual height difference between the vocalizer and listener (Figure 2). The main effect of
listener sex was also significant (Table 2, entry iv), showing that female listeners were generally more
likely to judge vocalizers as relatively taller than or of similar height to themselves than were male
listeners (Figure 2). Thus, as with strength, male listeners tended to underestimate the relative height
of female vocalizers (Figures 2A and 2C), and vice versa (Figures 1B and 1D). This suggests that sexual
dimorphism in actual height in adult humans (i.e., men are approximately 7%–10% taller than women,
Pisanski et al., 2014b) may induce disproportionate sex-dependent biases in listeners’ relative height
judgments.
Lastly, the interaction between stimulus type and vocalizer sex was significant (Table 2, entry x), with lis-
teners more likely to rate male vocalizers (but not female vocalizers) as taller than or of similar height to

 themselves when judging roars than speech (Figure 2). This is consistent with the hypothesis that roars
serve to exaggerate physical formidability, as observed in nonhuman mammals (Charlton et al., 2011; Harris
et al., 2006; Reby and McComb, 2003).
DISCUSSION
Earlier investigations of humans’ capacity to estimate physical formidability from the voice have exclusively
focused on absolute judgments of height or strength (e.g., Bruckert et al., 2006; Sell et al., 2010; Smith and
Patterson, 2005) or comparisons between pairs of vocalizers (e.g., Charlton et al., 2013a; Pisanski et al.,
2014a; Rendall et al., 2007). Our results provide the first evidence that listeners are able to estimate the
formidability of vocalizers relative to their own, a judgment perhaps more closely aligned with the hypoth-
esized central role of mate competition in selecting for the communication of formidability (Hill et al., 2013;
Hill et al., 2017).
Indeed, whereas previous studies typically report that strength and height explain relatively modest
proportions of variance in listeners’ formidability judgments, we show that both male and female listeners
can use available formidability cues conveyed in aggressive speech and roars to make ecologically relevant
judgments about speakers with a high degree of accuracy. For example, listeners erroneously judged

 relatively stronger vocalizers as weaker on only 18% of trials, and substantially stronger vocalizers as weaker
on only 6% of trials. Moreover, the finding that female listeners estimated strength (but not height) with
high accuracy adds to a small but growing body of evidence suggesting that the capacity to assess strength
may not only derive from sexual selection for mate competition, but also from female mate choice, with
some researchers arguing that body size is less important than strength to females’ judgments of males’
attractiveness (Sell et al., 2017).
Male vocalizers were more likely to be perceived as stronger relative to listeners when producing roars than
when producing aggressive speech. This effect was more pronounced when strength differences were
extreme, with listeners almost never (less than 1% of cases) rating substantially stronger male vocalizers
as weaker than themselves when judging roars. In turn, male listeners correctly identified substantially
weaker vocalizers as weaker on only 24% of trials when judging roars. Our results thus support the hypoth-
esis that men’s roars, like many of their nonhuman analogs, are sexually selected to exaggerate formida-
bility in male-male competitive interactions (Charlton et al., 2011; Harris et al., 2006; Morton, 1977; Reby
and McComb, 2003), but may also afford advantages to males in mate choice contexts (Charlton et al.,
2012; Charlton et al., 2007a, 2007b), likely as a result of resource holding potential benefits conferred by
greater formidability (Brues, 1959; Frederick and Haselton, 2007; Gallup et al., 2007; Judge and Cable,
2004; Monden and Smits, 2009; Pisanski and Feinberg, 2013; Sell et al., 2017).
The observation that women were more likely to rate vocalizers as relatively stronger than were men at the
same actual difference in strength is consistent with a general tendency for women to underestimate, and
for men to overestimate, their skills and abilities (Bleidorn et al., 2016; Ehrlinger and Dunning, 2003; Erkut,
1983; Freund and Kasten, 2012; Gold et al., 1980; Kosakowska-Berezecka et al., 2017; Syzmanowicz and
Furnham, 2011). Of particular interest is that women correctly identified relatively weaker male vocalizers
on only 25% of trials, and tended to judge similar strength male vocalizers as stronger than themselves.
Awareness of this negative bias may inform confidence-based interventions (already shown to ameliorate
the ‘‘confidence gap’’ in cognitive tasks, Bench et al., 2015; Ehrlinger and Dunning, 2003; Estes and Felker,
2012) in sexual assault resistance programs (Jordan and Mossman, 2017; Senn et al., 2015, 2017; Wong and
Balemba, 2016).
Future work could make use of outlier populations (e.g., bodybuilders) to examine the accuracy of and
biases in strength estimation at extremes of strength and to ascertain how male listeners assess the relative
strength of females who are stronger than them. In addition, given that in many nonhuman mammals
acoustic cues to formidability mediate dyadic agonistic interactions between competing males
(for example, large but not small dogs respond differentially to playback conditions simulating relatively
smaller or larger conspecifics [Taylor et al., 2010]), it is assumed that nonhuman mammals are also able
to assess the formidability of opponents relative to their own. To empirically verify this prediction, future
research should now further examine how between-individual variation in the formidability of nonhuman
receivers mediates vocal behavior (e.g., call response latency, calling rate, Charlton et al., 2013b; Reby
et al., 2005).

Participants 
11 
Vocal stimuli were recorded from 30 male and 31 female (M age = 22.79 ± 1.12) 
12 
drama or acting students from the Royal Central School of Speech and Drama and the 
13 
University of Sussex, United Kingdom, who received monetary compensation in 
14 
exchange for their participation.   
15 
We recruited separate samples of participants to provide voice-based 
16 
assessments of the relative strength and height of vocalizers. The sample that rated 
17 
strength (hereafter Experiment 1) consisted of 19 females and 26 males (age = 31.44 ± 
18 
8.33) recruited from Tromso and surrounding rural towns in Norway (N = 11, all fluent 
19 
English speakers), and from the University of Sussex, UK (N = 34), in return for prize 
20 
draw monetary compensations (5 x £20). The sample that rated height (hereafter 
21 
Experiment 2) consisted of 31 females and 25 males (age = 34.27 ± 10.39), recruited 
22 
from the USA using Amazon Mechanical Turk, and compensated with $1.75 USD. 
23 
Participants from both experiments provided informed consent and completed the 
24 
experiment online using a custom computer interface. Data from one female and male 
25 
 participant in Experiment 1, and from two female and two male participants in 
26 
Experiment 2, who did not complete the experiment but rated more than half of the 
27 
stimuli, were included in our analysis.  
28 
 
29 
Materials 
30 
 
31 
Vocal stimuli.  
32 
Vocalizers were audio recorded producing an aggressive roar and aggressive 
33 
speech in a quiet, anechoic room, standing 150 cm from a Zoom H4n microphone. A 
34 
chair was placed at this distance to restrict participants from moving closer to the 
35 
microphone. Vocalizers were instructed to produce the speech sentence, ‘That’s enough, 
36 
I’m coming for you!’, followed by a nonverbal vocalisation expressing the same 
37 
motivation, while imagining themselves in a battle or war scenario, about to charge and 
38 
attack. This resulted in a total of 122 vocal stimuli (see Electronic Supplementary 
39 
Materials for examples of aggressive roars and aggressive speech). 
40 
To obtain realistic vocal stimuli, participants were encouraged to take as much 
41 
time as they needed to immerse themselves in each imagined context, and to ‘let go of 
42 
their inhibitions’. Participants were also given the option not to vocalise if they felt that 
43 
they could not naturally produce the sentence or nonverbal vocalisation, and to repeat 
44 
each sentence or vocalisation until they were satisfied with their portrayal.  
45 
Recordings were saved as WAV files at 44.1 kHz sampling frequency and 16 bits 
46 
amplitude resolution. 
47 
 
48 
 
49 
 
50 
 Physical formidability measures.  
51 
We measured the height of vocalizers using metric tape. The average height of 
52 
our sample of vocalizers (male M = 182.03 ± 0.97 cm; female M = 167.10 ± 1.19 cm) 
53 
compares well with that of the general UK population (male M = 175.3cm, female M = 
54 
161.9 cm, Moody, 2013). Flexed bicep circumference and handgrip strength were also 
55 
measured, and these measurements were aggregated to produce a single, equally 
56 
weighted, z-scored strength value for each subject (following Sell et al. 2009; Puts et al. 
57 
2011, and others). These measures explain approximately 55% and 24% of the variance 
58 
in strength as measured by weight-lifting machines in male college students, 
59 
respectively (Sell et al., 2009). 
60 
To measure flexed bicep circumference (male M = 32.09 ± 0.60 cm; female M = 
61 
28.96 ± 0.70 cm), participants were instructed to rest the elbow of their dominant arm 
62 
on a table while seated, to clench their fist, and to curl their forearm perpendicular to the 
63 
table. The experimenter measured the circumference of the bicep at its highest point. A 
64 
Baseline hydraulic hand dynamometer in its standard use was used to measure the 
65 
handgrip strength of participants’ dominant arm (male M = 41.57 ± 1.36 kg; female M = 
66 
26.98 ± 1.06 kg). Each strength measure was recorded twice per subject and the highest 
67 
achievable score, representing greatest strength, was used in analyses. 
68 
 
69 
Procedure 
70 
All playback experiments were completed online on Syntoolkit, a dedicated 
71 
online testing platform for psychology studies (e.g., Hughes, Gruffydd, Simner & Ward, 
72 
in press; see Simner & Alvarez, in prep) that is particularly suited to running studies 
73 
with sensory or multisensory stimuli. Listeners were instructed to use headphones and 
74 
complete the experiment in a quiet place. To allow listeners to complete the experiment 
75 
 at a comfortable but audible volume, they were instructed to first set their volume to its 
76 
lowest level. Listeners then heard a demo sound file (amalgamating a loud and quiet 
77 
stimulus), and were instructed to raise their volume until they could clearly hear the 
78 
quiet stimulus, while the louder stimulus did not cause discomfort. Following this, 
79 
listeners were asked not to adjust the volume settings during the experiment unless it 
80 
became too uncomfortable, and were asked at the end of the experiment if they had 
81 
done so. Due to the agonistic nature of the stimuli, listeners were made aware that if 
82 
they felt uncomfortable or distressed listening to the sounds, they could stop the 
83 
experiment.  
84 
In playback experiments, vocal stimuli (n = 122) were blocked by sex and 
85 
stimulus type (speech/roar). The order of blocks and stimuli within blocks was 
86 
randomised. Before each block, participants were reminded to listen to each stimulus in 
87 
full, and informed that they could take a break at any time. Listeners rated the physical 
88 
strength (Experiment 1) or height (Experiment 2) of each voice stimulus (“Rate by how 
89 
much this person is stronger/taller or weaker/shorter than you”) on a 101-point scale 
90 
from -50 (much weaker/shorter) to 50 (much stronger/taller). We set the slider’s default 
91 
position to 0 (described as ‘same as you’) and did not compel listeners to move the 
92 
slider so as not to artificially force directional judgments.  
93 
Listeners were debriefed upon completion that the roars and screams were acted, 
94 
and that the vocalizers were not really experiencing aggression or distress. We 
95 
examined reaction times against stimulus durations to ensure that participants listened to 
96 
the stimuli before entering their ratings. No participants responded before half of the 
97 
stimulus had elapsed on more than five trials, thus no listeners were excluded. 
98 
To assess whether listeners could accurately judge the physical characteristics of 
99 
vocalizers relative to their own, we measured listeners’ own physical characteristics. In 
100 
 Experiment 1, we used a tailor’s tape measure to measure bicep circumference (male M 
101 
= 33.89 ± 0.46 cm; female M = 28.12 ± 0.57 cm), and a Takei hand dynamometer to 
102 
measure handgrip strength (male M = 46.11 ± 1.67 kg; female M = 33.03 ± 1.10 kg), in 
103 
identical fashion to measurements taken from vocalizers. These measures were taken in 
104 
person, prior to the listener completing the playback experiment online at a time of their 
105 
choosing. Both vocalizer and listener strength z-scores were calculated based on a 
106 
pooled sample of the listeners’ and the vocalizers’ measurements. Experiment 2 relied 
107 
on a self-report measure of height given at the start of the playback experiment (male M 
108 
= 176.38 ± 1.30 cm; female M = 169.36 ± 1.48 cm). The validity of self-report measures 
109 
of height has been extensively studied, and despite slight overestimations, self-reported 
110 
height closely reflects measured height within the age range of our sample of listeners 
111 
(Krul, Daanen, & Choi, 2011; Lim, Seubsman, & Sleigh, 2009; Parker, Dillard, & 
112 
Phillips, 1994; Wada et al., 2005). 
113 
 
114 
Coding and Statistical Analysis  
115 
 
116 
To examine strength/height estimation in functionally relevant terms, we divided 
117 
the actual difference in strength/height into five categories. In Experiment 1, percentage 
118 
differences between -10% and 10% were coded as ‘similar strength’, differences 
119 
between ± 10% and ± 30% were coded as ‘vocalizer is stronger (weaker) than listener’, 
120 
and differences greater than ± 30% were coded as ‘vocalizer is much stronger (weaker) 
121 
than listener’. In Experiment 2, we calculated by how many centimetres the vocalizer 
122 
was taller than the listener. Values were coded into identical categories of 11 cm 
123 
intervals. This interval was chosen as it produced a similar distribution to that observed 
124 
for our actual strength difference categories. 
125 
 In both experiments, we coded the rated difference in strength/height between 
126 
listener and vocalizer into three categories. Ratings between 45 and 55 were categorised 
127 
as ‘rated as similar strength’, and ratings above (below) this range were coded as 
128 
‘vocalizer rated as stronger (weaker)’. We computed a linear mixed multinomial logistic 
129 
regression, testing the effects of the actual strength/height difference between listener 
130 
and vocalizer, vocalizer sex, listener sex, and stimulus type on the rated difference 
131 
between listener and vocalizer, excluding actual difference categories with sample sizes 
132 
less than 15. In all models, we included listener identity as a subject variable, and 
133 
vocalizer identity as a random factor, thus allowing the intercepts and slopes of the 
134 
relationships between predictors and outcomes to vary between both vocalizers and 
135 
listeners and testing null hypotheses based on the average of these intercepts and slopes.
