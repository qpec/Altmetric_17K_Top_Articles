iral infection is one of the leading medical challenges of 
the 21st century. Viruses are parasites that lack the basic 
metabolic machinery needed to replicate or assemble and 
therefore must hijack host processes to complete their life cycle. 
Early research on metabolic changes in infected cells used 13C trac-
ing of glucose and glutamine to show that human cytomegalovi-
rus (HCMV) infection induces glycolysis and fatty acid synthesis 
in fibroblasts1. Direct pharmacological inhibition of this pathway 
suppresses HCMV replication2. More recently, lipidomics has been 
used to identify fatty acids and lipid mediators critical for influ-
enza replication in A549 cells3,4. Again, reversal of virus-suppressed 
 
ω3-polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) metabolism was shown to 
block viral replication4. System-wide proteomic and transcriptomic 
analysis of HCV infection in replicating Huh7.5 cells has suggested 
that the virus similarly hijacks host metabolism to support its 
 
replication, assembly and egress5,6. Together, these findings sug-
gest that viruses evolved as metabolic engineers, modulating host 
 
processes to optimize virus production.
Our focus was HCV infection, a pandemic affecting 3% of the 
world’s population7. This nonintegrating virus replicates in liver 
cells, causing fatty liver disease and type 2 diabetes8,9. The under-
lying cause of these metabolic changes is difficult to study owing 
to the lack of biopsy samples from patients in the early stages of 
infection and difficulties infecting primary hepatocytes in culture10. 
Nevertheless, studies using derivatives of the Huh7 cell line have 
shown that HCV strongly depends on host lipid metabolism for 
its replication, assembly and egress11. Proteomic analysis of HCV 
infection in Huh7 cells has shown that, like HCMV and influenza, 
HCV induces glycolytic enzymes but paradoxically upregulates the 
enzymes of oxidative phosphorylation as well6. Enigmatically, sev-
eral studies have demonstrated upregulation of both lipid peroxida-
tion and lipid accumulation in infected Huh7 cells5,6.
Interestingly, host metabolic processes are regulated at the 
transcriptional level by a network of ligand-activated transcrip-
tion factors called nuclear receptors12. Unraveling the connections 
between transcriptional regulators and the virus-induced meta-
bolic response would permit systematic modulation of metabolic 
pathways, enabling scientists to probe the complexity of host–virus 
interactions. Regretfully, transcriptional control of metabolism is 
often obscured by other, massive disease-induced transcriptional 
responses, such as inflammation and wound healing. Consequently, 
attempts to link metabolic fluxes to transcriptional regulation thus 
far have been carried out primarily in single-cell organisms13.
Here we overcame the technical barriers to in vitro study of HCV 
infection by using oxygenated cocultures of primary human hepa-
tocytes that support normal gene expression levels and metabolic 
function14. We found that these cocultures supported robust HCV 
infection, which caused metabolic changes that stabilized after 8 d 
of culture (Fig. 1). This stable experimental system allowed us to 
use targeted metabolomics to derive a complete metabolic network 
induced by HCV infection. Using this metabolic network, we iden-
tified differentially activated metabolic fluxes and corresponding 
changes in gene expression. We identified transcriptional regulators, 
validated them experimentally using a library of GFP reporters, and 
systematically perturbed their activity using small-molecule inhibi-
tors. Our analysis showed that HCV-infected primary hepatocytes 
become dependent on an HNF4α-induced shift from oxidative 
phosphorylation to glycolysis. In addition, we clarify the paradoxical

Viruses lack the basic machinery needed to replicate and therefore must hijack the host’s metabolism to propagate. Virus-
induced metabolic changes have yet to be systematically studied in the context of host transcriptional regulation, and 
such studies shoul offer insight into host–pathogen metabolic interplay. In this work we identified hepatitis C virus (HCV)-
responsive regulators by coupling system-wide metabolic-flux analysis with targeted perturbation of nuclear receptors in 
primary human hepatocytes. We found HCV-induced upregulation of glycolysis, ketogenesis and drug metabolism, with 
 
glycolysis controlled by activation of HNF4a, ketogenesis by PPARa and FXR, and drug metabolism by PXR. Pharmaceutical 
inhibition of HNF4a reversed HCV-induced glycolysis, blocking viral replication while increasing apoptosis in infected 
cells showing virus-induced dependence on glycolysis. In contrast, pharmaceutical inhibition of PPARa or FXR reversed 
 
HCV-induced ketogenesis but increased viral replication, demonstrating a novel host antiviral response. Our results show 
that virus-induced changes to a host’s metabolism can be detrimental to its life cycle, thus revealing a biologically complex 
 
relationship between virus and host.

disconnect between lipid oxidation and accumulation, and con-
comitantly show that drug metabolism was significantly induced 
by HCV infection in this study. Finally, we confirmed our find-
ings using patient serum and biopsy samples. Our work elucidates 
the metabolic fingerprint of HCV infection, identifying distinct 
 
assemblies of transcriptional–metabolic regulatory circuits in pri-
mary human hepatocytes.
ReSultS
Robust HCV infection of primary human hepatocytes
We cocultured freshly isolated primary human hepatocytes with 
endothelial cells expressing the HCV capture receptor L-SIGN15. 
Cells were seeded in 95% oxygen under serum-free conditions14 
and infected with the JFH-1 cell-culture variant of HCV or a mock-
infection control on the first day of culture (Fig. 1a). Hepatocytes 
cocultured with L-SIGN-expressing endothelial cells showed 2.6-
fold higher levels of intracellular HCV RNA after 10 d of infection 
compared with those cultured alone (P < 0.05; Supplementary 
Results, Supplementary Fig. 1). Primary hepatocyte morphology 
 
was markedly altered by HCV infection. Naive cells displayed a 
cuboidal morphology, smooth cytoplasm and bright cell borders 
indicative of differentiated, healthy cells. In contrast, JFH-1-infected 
cells were noticeably smaller and contained numerous lipid droplets 
in their cytoplasm (Fig. 1b). To visualize infection and lipid accu-
mulation, we infected hepatocytes with a JC1 variant of HCV that 
contained an in-frame insertion of RFP in the NS5A viral protein16 
(hereinafter called JC1-RFP) and counterstained for intracellular 
triglycerides (Fig. 1c). Fluorescence microscopy showed that 50% 
± 15% of the hepatocytes were positive for HCV after 10 d of infec-
tion. HCV production stabilized after 8 d of infection, reaching 
30% of the RNA level of model cells (Huh7.5.1 infected with JFH-1) 
 
and infectivity titers of 400 focus forming units (f.f.u.) per ml 
 
(Fig. 1d). Intracellular analysis showed HCV core protein levels of 
6.2 ± 2 fmol per mg of total protein and a 4.4-fold increase in intra-
cellular triglycerides (P < 0.05); these results confirm steatosis, a 
clinical hallmark of infection (Fig. 1d). Interestingly, although JFH-
1-infected Huh7.5.1 cells showed a marked increase in apoptosis 
upon infection, no significant cell death was observed in primary

hepatocytes. Cell viability remained constant above 90% ± 5% with 
minimal ALT release (Supplementary Fig. 1).
Long-term analysis of metabolic activity showed clear differ-
ences between HCV-infected and uninfected cocultures (Fig. 1e, 
Supplementary Fig. 1). Glucose uptake rates in JFH-1-infected cocul-
tures were 29% ± 5% higher (P < 0.01), whereas urea and albumin pro-
duction were consistently 39% ± 4% and 70% ± 7% lower (P < 0.01), 
respectively. Lactate and ketone body production were both elevated, 
whereas the production of triglyceride was dramatically reduced by 
69% ± 20% (P < 0.01). Similar to previous reports10, we observed 
metabolic changes occurring 4 d post-infection, when HCV infec-
tivity began to peak. Metabolic changes stabilized 8 d post-infection, 
 
correlating with HCV production reaching a steady state (Fig. 1d,e).
metabolic fingerprint of HCV infection
The stabilization of primary hepatocyte metabolism, and the quies-
cent state of the cells, simplifies the derivation of intracellular fluxes 
by applying mass balance around basic metabolites at pseudo- 
steady state17 (Supplementary Tables 1 and 2). In total, 31 different 
 
metabolites were measured by targeted metabolomics over 48 h on 
days 9–11 of culture (Online Methods), and the cells were lysed on 
day 11 for protein and mRNA analysis. Figure 2a shows the meta-
bolic fingerprint of HCV infection, with HCV up- and downregu-
lated metabolic fluxes. Several pathways show clear, statistically 
significant (P < 0.05), coordinated changes after HCV infection. 
These include the upregulation of glycolysis toward lactate produc-
tion (flux 1–8) as well as upregulation of ketone body production 
(flux 47–50). In contrast to previous proteomic studies using Huh7 
cells6, cholesterol and bile acid synthesis were strongly downregu-
lated (flux 76–79), as were glutamine and nitrogen metabolism 
 
(flux 15–20) and oxidative phosphorylation (flux 10–14).
To validate our results, we quantified changes in oxidative phos-
phorylation, fatty acid oxidation and glycolysis in JFH-1-infected 
primary hepatocytes and in cells treated with sofosbuvir, an antiviral 
with direct action against HCV18 (Online Methods). JFH-1 infection 
caused a 36% ± 4% drop in oxidative phosphorylation, indicating a 
significant shift to glycolysis (P < 0.0001; Fig. 2b,c, Supplementary 
Figs. 2 and 10). Sofosbuvir treatment reversed this effect, but func-
tion remained lower than in naive cells (P < 0.001), possibly because 
of residual HCV or lingering damage (Fig. 2b,c). In contrast, HCV 
infection increased fatty acid oxidation by 85% ± 29% (P < 0.02), and 
this effect was also reversed by treatment with sofosbuvir (P = 0.058; 
Fig. 2b,c, Supplementary Fig. 2). Finally, HCV infection increased 
glycolysis by 169% ± 10% (P < 4 × 10−5), and the effect was com-
pletely reversed by treatment with sofosbuvir (P = 0.368; Fig. 2b,c, 
 
Supplementary Fig. 2). This well-coordinated transition from 
energetic to glycolytic phenotype (known as the Warburg effect) 
and fatty acid oxidation, coupled with inhibition of the urea cycle, is 
markedly similar to the metabolic transformation in liver cancer19.
Regulation of HCV-induced metabolic transformation
Gene expression analysis of naive and HCV-infected primary hepa-
tocytes identified 893 differentially expressed genes (false discovery 
rate (FDR) q-threshold < 0.05). Unbiased enrichment analysis iden-
tified multiple affected processes, including wound healing (P < 6.3 × 
 
10−12), oxidative stress (P < 3.2 × 10−8) and drug and lipid metabo-
lism (Supplementary Fig. 3). Gene-set enrichment analysis (GSEA) 
focused on metabolic terms showed significant HCV-induced upreg-
ulation of drug metabolism (P < 0.0001), fatty acid oxidation (P < 
0.0065) and glycolysis (P < 0.05), as well as downregulation of oxida-
tive phosphorylation (Supplementary Fig. 4). Changes in gluconeo-
genesis and fatty acid biosynthesis were not significant (P > 0.135).

These HCV-induced metabolic changes suggest underlying tran-
scriptional regulation. To elucidate this regulation, we grouped func-
tional annotations into six metabolic categories that were sufficiently 
large for our statistics20,21 (Supplementary Table 3). The differen-
tially expressed genes were enriched in lipid metabolism (P < 3.2 × 
10−8), cholesterol metabolism (P < 2.4 × 10−12), glucose metabolism 
(P < 1.2 × 10−14) and drug metabolism (P < 1.1 × 10−13). We found 214 
differentially expressed genes (24%) involved in metabolic processes 
(Supplementary Fig. 3). To identify regulators, we searched for tran-
scription factors with target genes that were differentially expressed 
during HCV infection (Supplementary Tables 4 and 5). Targets were 
taken from the TRANSFAC database and computationally validated 
using genome-wide binding data for HNF4α and CEBPα in human 
hepatocytes22, as well as mouse overexpression data23. Our unbiased 
search for regulators identified 14 transcription factors control-
ling the observed changes in metabolic genes, including 12 nuclear 
receptors known to have a role in regulating the metabolic pathways 
identified above. We constructed GFP activity reporters for the 14 
transcription factors but were able to experimentally validate only 
seven functional reporters (Supplementary Fig. 5).
HNF4a-induced glycolysis is an HCV proviral response
HCV-infected primary hepatocytes significantly upregulate glycoly-
sis toward the production of lactate (P < 0.01) while decreasing mito-
chondrial oxidative phosphorylation, suggesting a Warburg-like effect 
in nonproliferating primary hepatocytes (Figs. 2b,c and 3a). GSEA 
showed significant HCV-induced upregulation of glycolysis but no sig-
nificant change in gluconeogenesis (Fig. 3a, Supplementary Fig. 4). 
 
An unbiased search for transcriptional regulators of glycolysis 
showed that HCV infection activated HNF1α (MODY3) and HNF4α 
(MODY1), factors implicated in the development of maturity-on-
set diabetes of the young (MODY), a hereditary form of diabetes 
 
(Fig. 3b,c). The change in expression of regulators and key target 
genes was independently confirmed by qRT-PCR (Fig. 3d).
To validate the casual role of HNF4α in a rigorous model of HCV 
infection, we electroporated JC1-RFP or polymerase-negative (Pol−) 
HCV RNA into Huh7.5.1 cells (Online Methods). Cells were then 
infected with an HNF4α activity reporter in which binding of an 
activated nuclear receptor drives EGFP expression (Fig. 3e). HNF4α 
activity was greater by (4 ± 1)-fold in HCV-positive cells compared 
to Pol− controls (Supplementary Fig. 5). HNF4α activation was

reversed after treatment with the HNF4α antagonists Medica16 
and BI6015 (refs. 24,25; Fig. 3e). Huh7.5.1 cells replicating JC1-RFP 
produced more lactate, the end product of glycolysis, than Pol− con-
trols did (P < 0.05). However, treatment with Medica16, BI6015 or 
short interfering RNA (siRNA) reversed this increase in glycolysis 
(P < 0.001; Fig. 3f, Supplementary Figs. 6 and 7). Importantly, 
HCV replication was blocked by treatment with either Medica16 
(P = 0.016) or BI6015 (P < 0.001), leading to a three- to fourfold 
decrease in viral RNA both in cells infected with JC1 (genotype 2a) 
and in full-length genotype 1b replicon cells26, as well as in primary 
human hepatocytes (Fig. 3e,g, Supplementary Figs. 8 and 9).
To confirm that HCV relies on glycolysis, we treated Huh7.5.1 
cells replicating JC1-RFP with the glycolytic inhibitors 2DG and 
BrPA, as well as DCA, a PDK1 inhibitor (Fig. 3h, Supplementary 
Fig. 13). Treatment with 2DG and BrPA blocked HCV replication 
(P < 0.001), whereas downstream treatment with DCA showed 
marginal inhibition (P < 0.05), demonstrating viral reliance on gly-
colytic by-products (Fig. 3h). Moreover, HCV infection caused liver

cells to become sensitive to Medica16, showing a fourfold increase 
in apoptosis over Pol− controls (Fig. 3i,j). These results show a 
strong proviral effect of HCV-induced glycolysis.
HCV-induced lipid oxidation is an antiviral response
HCV infection has a puzzling effect on lipid metabolism, as cells 
show both lipid accumulation and oxidation at the same time5,6. The 
involvement of the PPARα transcription factor in this process has 
been under debate27,28. We found that HCV-infected primary hepa-
tocytes significantly upregulated fatty acid oxidation toward the 
production of ketone bodies (P < 0.01) while downregulating choles-
terol biosynthesis (P < 0.01; Figs. 2b and 4a, Supplementary Fig. 2). 
Surprisingly, GSEA showed upregulation of both (Supplementary 
Fig. 4). However, we identified two bifurcation points. First, induc-
tion of HMGCL over HMGCR directs acetyl-CoA toward ketone 
bodies rather than cholesterol (Fig. 4a), and induction of ADRP 
directs part of the triglyceride flux to lipid droplets rather than lipo-
proteins (Fig. 4a). An unbiased search for transcriptional regulators 
of lipid metabolism revealed a hierarchal interconnected network 
of transcription factors with a role in lipid metabolism (Fig. 4b). 
The nuclear receptors PPARα, SREBP, FXR and LXRα are known 
regulators of fatty acid oxidation (PPARα and SREBP), cholesterol 
metabolism and bile acid metabolism (FXR and LXRα). Figure 4c  
shows the links between PPARα, FXR and the metabolic pathway. 
Regulators and target genes for each factor were independently 
 
confirmed by qRT-PCR (Fig. 4d).
We again sought to validate our findings in Huh7.5.1 cells 
robustly infected with JC1-RFP or Pol− controls. Cells were infected 
with PPARα, SREBP, FXR and LXRα activity reporters (Fig. 4b and 
Supplementary Fig. 5). Although the activity of SREBP and LXRα 
did not change, we observed a threefold induction of PPARα activ-
ity (P < 0.001) and a 3.8-fold induction of FXR activity (P < 0.001) 
in HCV-infected cells versus Pol− controls (Fig. 4e). Activation of 
PPARα was reversed by treatment with its inhibitors GW9662 and 
GW6471, and FXR activation was blocked by its inhibitor BML-
GR235 (Z-guggulsterone; Fig. 4e,g). Huh7.5.1 cells replicating JC1-
RFP showed a two-fold increase in ketone body production and 
a two-fold decrease in bile acid production, respective end prod-
ucts of fatty acid oxidation and cholesterol biosynthesis (Fig. 4f). 
 
Importantly, treatment with GW9662 or GW6471 reversed the 
HCV-induced increase in ketone body production (P < 0.001), and 
treatment with BML-GR235 reversed the decrease in bile acid pro-
duction (P < 0.001; Fig. 4f). siRNA against each regulator showed 
similar results (Supplementary Fig. 6). Inhibition by these com-
pounds provides internal controls showing independent PPARα 
regulation of fatty acid oxidation and FXR regulation of cholesterol 
biosynthesis (Supplementary Fig. 7). Interestingly, all three inhibi-
tors increased replication of HCV genotype 2a by 40–50%, lead-
ing to a 1.4-fold increase in viral RNA (Fig. 4g). A similar 1.8- to 
2.4-fold increase in HCV was seen for genotype 1b replicon cells 
and primary human hepatocytes (Supplementary Figs. 8 and 9). 
To confirm that HCV relies on fatty acid oxidation, we treated 
Huh7.5.1 cells replicating JC1-RFP with etomoxir and ranolazine, 
inhibitors of fatty acid oxidation (Fig. 4h, Supplementary Fig. 13). 
Treatment with etomoxir and ranolazine increased HCV replication 
(P < 0.001) by 2- and 1.5-fold, respectively.
To probe the second bifurcation point (Fig. 4a), we used 
intracellular fluorescent staining to quantify lipid accumula-
tion (Online Methods). We found that PPARα inhibition led to 
increased lipid accumulation (Fig. 4i,j). We note that the HCV 
life cycle is dependent on lipid accumulation in droplets29 as well 
as on cholesterol biosynthesis for FBL2 anchoring30. Therefore, in 
contrast to HNF4α induction of glycolysis, the observed activa-
tion of PPARα and FXR during HCV infection is detrimental for 
the virus life cycle and might be part of a host metabolic antiviral 
response to infection.
HCV activation of PXR induces hepatic drug metabolism
Changes in hepatic drug metabolism can affect drug clearance rates 
but are difficult to assess in Huh7.5.1 cells owing to marginal expres-
sion of CYP450 enzymes. CYP3A4 is responsible for the clearance 
of 40% of drugs on the market, including newly introduced anti-
virals. Our experimental system of primary human hepatocytes 
does not share this limitation and showed eightfold and sixfold 
upregulation of CYP3A4 and CYP2C9, respectively, in response to 
viral infection (P < 0.001; Fig. 5c). Other important drug-clearance 
enzymes such as CYP1A2, 2E1 and 2D6 showed a similar two- to 
sixfold increase in expression (P < 0.05; Supplementary Fig. 11). 
To confirm these results, we carried out CYP450 activity assays in

JFH-1-infected primary human hepatocytes. CYP3A4 and CYP2E1 
showed twofold and threefold increases in activity, respectively (P 
< 0.05), confirming our results (Fig. 5e).
An unbiased search for transcriptional regulators of drug metab-
olism revealed a small network of transcription factors with roles in 
drug metabolism (Fig. 5a). Figure 5b shows the links among HNF4α, 
PXR, CAR and the CYP450 enzymes. Regulators and target genes 
were independently confirmed by qRT-PCR (Fig. 5c). We sought 
to validate these findings in Huh7.5.1 cells robustly infected with 
JC1-RFP or Pol− controls. Cells expressing the PXR activity reporter 
showed a 5.3-fold induction of PXR activity (P < 0.05) in HCV-
infected cells compared to Pol− controls (Fig. 5d, Supplementary 
Fig. 5). Activation of PXR was reversed by its inhibitor silibinin31 
without observable effects on viral replication (Fig. 5d). Exposure 
to silibinin blocked the HCV-induced induction of CYP3A4 
 
activity, reversing the effect of PXR (Fig. 5e).
Clinical validation of HCV-induced metabolic changes
Our in vitro primary human hepatocyte cocultures reproduced 
known clinical features of HCV infection (i.e., steatosis and hypo-
lipidemia) while predicting others (i.e., decreased bile acids and 
increased ketones) (Fig. 1). To test these predictions, we analyzed 
gene expression in liver biopsy samples obtained from HCV patients 
in early stages of infection and compared them to healthy controls 
(Online Methods). Although in vivo gene expression levels seldom 
correlate with in vitro levels, expression in primary human hepa-
tocytes was strongly correlated to expression in biopsies of healthy 
liver, with R2 = 0.85 (Fig. 6a). We identified 1,259 genes that were 
differentially expressed in liver biopsies during HCV infection (FDR 
q < 0.01). However, in spite of the well-known metabolic problems 
associated with HCV infection, unbiased enrichment analysis did 
not identify any metabolic terms due to overlapping processes such 
as an immune response (P < 5.2 × 10−3), underscoring the need for 
in vitro analysis.
However, genes differentially expressed in vivo were enriched 
with those found in vitro (P < 0.005), as well as with genes involved in 
glucose, lipid and drug metabolism (Supplementary Figs. 3 and 4). 
 
Limiting our analysis to metabolic genes, we found that 88% of the 
genes induced by HCV infection in vitro (Fig. 6b) were similarly 
induced in vivo. For example, expression of genes from the cyto-
chrome P450 family increased with HCV infection both in vivo and 
in vitro (Supplementary Fig. 11). However, genes downregulated by 
HCV infection in vitro were randomly distributed in terms of in vivo 
 
expression (Fig. 6b), possibly because of the presence of multiple 
cell types (i.e., immune cells) in liver biopsies. An unbiased search 
for transcriptional regulators in vivo revealed a similar network of 
transcription factors enriched for differentially expressed metabolic 
genes, including HNF4α, PPARα and FXR (Fig. 6d).
To further test our metabolic findings, we obtained plasma sam-
ples from HCV patients in early stages of infection and compared 
them to samples from healthy control subjects (Fig. 6c). There was 
marginally more alanine transaminase (ALT) in plasma from HCV 
patients (97 U/L versus 21 U/L), confirming low levels of inflam-
mation due to steatosis (P < 0.001). Serum cholesterol levels were 
17% lower (P < 0.01) during infection, as has been previously 
shown32. In addition, there was a small (13%) increase in serum 
glucose levels (P < 0.05), suggesting disturbed glycemic control. 
Importantly, we found that circulating bile acid levels decreased 
by 53% (P < 0.05), whereas levels of β-hydroxybutyrate (βHB) 
ketone bodies increased by 36% (P < 0.05). Lactate levels showed a 
minor increase of 13%. These results strongly support our in vitro  
observations, confirming the rapid metabolic changes taking 
 
hold in early stages of HCV infection.

processes. Nuclear receptors are activated by metabolites such 
 
as fatty acids and glucose, and they control negative feedback 
loops12,33, offering an opportunity to reprogram metabolism at the 
transcriptional level. This approach is appealing in the context of 
metabolic disease and viral infection, where pharmaceutical targeting 
of transcriptional regulators could rewire chronic metabolic states.
In this work, we studied the effects of HCV infection on primary 
human hepatocytes. Our cocultures of primary human hepatocytes 
with L-SIGN+ endothelial cells showed robust infection, affect-
ing 50% of the cells (Fig. 1), compared with previously reported 
infection rates of 6–10% (ref. 10). Similar infection rates, ranging 
from 20% to 50%, have been found in vivo34,35. In contrast to ear-
lier work on Huh7 cells, infection of primary hepatocytes repro-
duced lipid accumulation and hypolipidemia, clinical hallmarks of 
infection, matching the transcriptional and metabolic signature of 
patient samples (Fig. 6). This allowed us to track metabolic changes 
 
with confidence and correlate these changes to their underlying 
transcriptional regulators (Figs. 3–5).
The effect of HCV infection on CYP450 expression is an area 
of major interest for pharmaceutical development, and it could not 
be studied in Huh7 cells, as tumors show minimal expression of 
CYP450 enzymes. We show that HCV upregulates CYP3A4 both 
in vitro and in vivo (Fig. 5). This increase would affect the clearance 
rates of emerging antiviral drugs that are substrates of CYP3A4, 
such as telaprevir, boceprevir and simeprevir.
We also show that HCV infection of primary hepatocytes 
induces glycolysis over oxidative phosphorylation in a manner 
similar to HCMV infection of fibroblasts2 and the Warburg effect 
in cancer36,37. Although upregulation of glycolysis has been previ-
ously observed in HCV-infected Huh7.5 cells via proteomic analy-
sis6, so have oxidative phosphorylation and glutamine metabolism6. 
This suggests that the global upregulation of metabolic pathways 
previously reported was a result of HCV-induced upregulation of 
Huh7.5 proliferation, rather than the host response to infection38. 
In contrast, our model shows a striking induction of glycolysis 
over oxidative phosphorylation in both primary human hepato-
cytes and growth-arrested Huh7.5 cells (Supplementary Fig. 10), 
 
strengthening earlier evidence of HCMV-induced glycolysis in 
serum-starved fibroblasts2.
An unbiased search for metabolic regulators showed that HNF4α, 
a nuclear receptor associated with MODY39, has a critical role in 
host glycolytic response. Although there are conflicting reports 
regarding HNFs in HCV infection40,41, our work clearly shows that 
HNF4α inhibition reverses glycolysis in infected cells. Suppression 
of glycolysis by Medica16, BI6015 or the glycolytic inhibitors 
2DG and BrPA blocked HCV replication as a result of substrate 
 
limitation (Fig. 3). Importantly, the treatment also increased apop-
tosis in HCV-infected cells, suggesting that the process is driven 
by host reliance on nonoxidative energy (Fig. 2) rather than by the 
needs of the virus.
Unraveling lipid metabolism proved more complex. Early 
analysis of HCV-infected cells suggested cross-purpose induction 
of both fatty acid oxidation and lipogenesis6. Lipogenesis is simi-
larly induced in HCMV infection and certain types of cancer42, 
but not in HCV infection of primary hepatocytes. In fact, lipid 
 
peroxidation has recently been shown to attenuate HCV replication 
and egress43,44. Our results show PPARα-dependent induction of 
fatty acid oxidation and FXR-dependent suppression of cholesterol 
biosynthesis (Fig. 4). Similar activation of FXR has a critical role 
in liver carcinogenesis45. These results are surprising, as HCV relies 
on cholesterol biosynthesis to anchor its NS5A cofactor through 
FBL2 (ref. 46) and on lipid droplets for replication and lipoprotein- 
dependent egress29,47. Importantly, inhibition of either nuclear recep-
tor, or of fatty acid oxidation directly, caused considerable upregula-
tion of HCV replication, suggesting that in contrast to HNF4α, the 
effects of PPARα and FXR are part of a host antiviral response.
In summary, our work provides a metabolic fingerprint of HCV 
infection in primary human hepatocytes, mapping it to transcrip-
tional regulators that can be pharmaceutically modulated. We show 
that viral infection dramatically affects host metabolism, but not 
always for the benefit of the virus. The results show that virus needs 
can conflict with the host’s requirement for energy and that virus 
replication might be tightly controlled by positive and negative 
interactions with the host48.

Hepatocyte oxygenated cocultures. Primary human hepatocytes were obtained 
from BD Biosciences or were kindly provided by Dr. Stephen C. Strom 
(University of Pittsburgh). Human cells were purified in 33% Percoll solution 
centrifuged at 500g for 5 min before seeding. Cell viability post-purification was 
greater than 90%, and purity was greater than 95%. After purification hepato-
cytes were mixed with lung endothelial cells (Lonza) at a 4:3 ratio in ice-cold 
culture medium and seeded at 175,000 cells/cm2 in a humidified incubator set 
at 37 °C and conditioned by a gas mixture of 95% oxygen and 5% CO2 (Airgas). 
After overnight seeding under 95% oxygen, the cultures were returned to 
atmospheric levels of oxygen and 5% CO2. HCV infection was carried out 24 h 
after seeding (day 1). Cells were cultured in serum-free basal medium (Lonza) 
supplemented with ascorbic acid, transferrin, EGF and antibiotics. Medium 
was further supplemented with 100 μg/mL of rat-tail collagen during seeding to 
enhance attachment14. Hepatocyte culture medium was collected every 48 h and 
stored at −80 °C for metabolic analysis. After 11 d of culture (10 d post-infection) 
 
endothelial cells were removed by trypsinization and the hepatocyte population 
was scraped off the surface for protein and mRNA analysis. Hepatocyte purity 
post-trypsinization was assessed by immunofluorescence microscopy and was 
found to be greater than 95%. Cultures were confirmed to be free of myco-
plasma contamination using a PCR test kit (Biological Industries).
Drugs and reagents. 2-DG (sc-202010), BrPA (sc-296029), and DCA 
(sc-260854) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. GW9662 
(M6191), GW6471 (G5045), etomoxir (E1905), ranolazine (R6152), silibinin 
(S0417), and Medica16 (M5693) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. BI6015 
(4641) was purchased from Tocris, and BML-GR235 (39025) was purchased 
from Enzo. A Human Albumin Elisa Quantitation Set (E80-129) was purchased 
from Bethyl Laboratories. A Human α-Fetoprotein ELISA kit (ab108838) was 
purchased from Abcam.
JFH-1, JC1-RFP
, and polymerase-negative (Pol−) RNA production and elec-
troporation. The Huh7.5.1 human hepatoma cell line was provided by F. Chisari 
(Scripps Research Institute). Huh7.5.1 cells were cultured in DMEM supple-
mented with 10% FBS and 200 units/mL penicillin–streptomycin in a 5% CO2-
humidified incubator at 37 °C. Plasmids containing the JFH-1 and JC1-RFP 
full-length genome were kindly provided by T. Wakita (National Institute of 
Infectious Diseases) and R. Bartenschlager (University of Heidelberg), respec-
tively. The JFH replicon containing the GND inactivating mutation in the viral 
polymerase (Pol−) served as negative control. In vitro transcribed JFH-1, JC1-RFP 
and Pol− RNA were delivered to cells by electroporation using a BTX model 830 
electroporator (820 V
, five 99-μs pulses given at 220-ms intervals). Cells were left 
to recover for 15 min at 22 °C and then mixed with 10 mL of pre-warmed growth 
medium and seeded for further analysis. Fluorescence microscopy showed robust 
JC1-RFP infection affecting over 90% of the Huh7.5.1 cells. To generate JFH-1 
and JC1-RFP viruses for infection, we collected Huh7.5.1 conditioned medium 
for 72 h after electroporation. Conditioned medium was concentrated and used 
to infect primary human hepatocytes at multiplicity of infection of 0.5–1 for 24 h. 
 
Culture medium was subsequently changed daily. The mock control consisted 
 
of similarly processed medium conditioned by naive Huh7.5.1 cells.
Quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). 
Virus samples were purified using a QIAamp viral RNA mini kit (Qiagen). The 
reverse-transcription reaction step was performed on a Mastercycler ep Gradient 
S (Eppendorf) instrument using a High Capacity cDNA reverse transcription 
kit (Applied Biosystems). Real-time PCR was performed on a MyiQ real-time 
PCR detection system using the iScript One-Step RT-PCR kit with SYBR Green 
(Bio-Rad) according to the respective manufacturers’ instructions.
Small-molecule inhibition of nuclear receptor and metabolic targets. JC1-
RFP or Pol− electroporated Huh7.5.1 cells were grown to 90% confluence and 
treated with small-molecule inhibitors or DMSO control for 24 h. Primary 
human hepatocytes were similarly treated 10 d post-infection. Cell viability 
was >90% for all concentrations tested (Supplementary Fig. 12).
Central glycolysis inhibitors 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2DG) and 3-bromopyru-
vate acid (BrPA) were used at 1 mM and 10 μM, respectively. Dichloroacetate 
(DCA), which blocks PDK1, redirecting pyruvate to oxidative phosphoryla-
tion, was used at 100 μM (ref. 49). Fatty-acid-oxidation inhibitors etomoxir50 
and ranolazine51 were used at 100 μM and 50 μM, respectively.
The specificity of nuclear-receptor antagonists was validated using 
 
qRT-PCR (Supplementary Fig. 5). HNF4α activation was reversed after treat-
ment with 250 μM Medica16 or 5 μM BI6015 (refs. 24,25). PPARα activation 
was reversed by treatment with 10 μM GW9662 or 10 μM GW6471. FXR 
was blocked by treatment with 100 μM BML-GR235 (ref. 52), and PXR was 
blocked by treatment with 200 μM silibinin31. HCV levels were determined by 
 
qRT-PCR and fluorescence quantification of JC1-RFP normalized to the 
number of Hoechst-positive nuclei.
HCV infectivity. The production of infectious JFH-1 virus particles by primary 
hepatocytes was measured as previously described44. Briefly, naive Huh7.5.1 
cells were grown to 80% confluence and exposed to cell culture supernatants 
serially diluted tenfold in the culture medium. After overnight incubation at 
37 °C, 5% CO2, the medium was replaced, and cells were cultured for an addi-
tional 3 d. Levels of HCV infection were determined by immunofluorescence 
staining for HCV core protein47. The viral titer is expressed in focus forming 
units (f.f.u.) per milliliter of supernatant.
Biochemical assays. Albumin concentration was determined with a commer-
cial ELISA kit (Bethyl Laboratories). Urea concentration was measured with a 
blood urea nitrogen kit (Stanbio Labs). Glucose and lactate levels were deter-
mined using commercial kits testing for glucose oxidase (Stanbio Labs) and lac-
tate oxidase (Trinity Biotech, Bray), respectively. Triglycerides were quantified 
using a commercial kit (Sigma Chemical) based on glycerol quantification. Free 
fatty acids were determined on the basis of their CoA derivatives using a com-
mercial kit (BioVision). The ketone bodies acetoacetate and β-hydroxybutyrate 
were measured by the disappearance of NADH in the conversion of acetoace-
tate to β-hydroxybutyrate in the presence of β-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase 
and by the production of NADH in the reverse reaction. Cholesterol was meas-
ured using a commercial kit (Stanbio Labs) based on cholesterol oxidase. Total 
bile acids were determined through NADH formation using a commercial kit 
(BioQuant). Individual amino acid concentrations in medium samples were 
quantified by HPLC as previously described53. ALT and AST levels were quan-
tified using a commercially available kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). HCV core 
proteins were measured using the ORTHO HCV antigen ELISA kit (Ortho 
Clinical Diagnostics). The oxygen uptake rate was measured in parallel cul-
tures using the Ocean Optics FOXY fiber optic oxygen sensor immersed in a 
well-stirred chamber as previously described54.
Metabolic flux balance analysis (MFA). MFA is a stoichiometric model of 
hepatocyte metabolism in which intracellular fluxes are calculated via the 
application of mass balances around basic metabolites. The analytical predic-
tions of the model used in this work were previously confirmed using radio-
labeled substrates55. The stabilization of primary hepatocyte metabolism 8 d 
after infection, and the lack of cell proliferation, allowed us to use the model 
under steady-state conditions, which reduced the balance equations to a set 
of linear algebraic equations given by dz/dt = S × v = 0, where z represents 
metabolites, S is an n × m matrix of coefficients, and v is a vector of m fluxes17,56. 
This approach accounts for the complex interdependence between pathways 
due to a common pool of cofactors and thus provides a comprehensive picture 
of the hepatic metabolic state17,56. Here we expanded the model to include lipid 
metabolism, adding fluxes for cholesterol synthesis, bile production, triglycer-
ide synthesis and accumulation. The mathematical model uses 35 metabolites 
and 80 chemical reactions implemented and solved using MATLAB. Because 
of linear dependence the matrix is completely determined.
Metabolic flux quantification of HCV-infected and sofosbuvir-treated cells. 
Primary human hepatocytes were infected with JFH-1 containing medium for 7 
d and treated with 10 μM sofosbuvir (Cayman Chemical) or DMSO vehicle con-
trol for 72 h. 3.5 × 103 cells were plated on collagen-coated XFp Flux Analyzer 
Miniplates (Seahorse Bioscience). A mitochondrial stress test assay was con-
ducted per the manufacturer’s instructions (Seahorse Bioscience). Briefly, cells 
were incubated in unbuffered DMEM supplemented with 2 mM glutamine,

1 mM sodium pyruvate, and 10 mM glucose (pH 7.4) for 1 h at 37 °C in a non-
CO2 incubator. We measured the basal oxygen consumption rate (OCR) for 30 
min and then injected 1 μM oligomycin, a mitochondrial complex V inhibitor 
that blocks oxidative phosphorylation. The decrease in OCR due to oligomycin 
treatment was defined as the oxidative phosphorylation rate. 1 μM carbonyl 
cyanide 4-(trifluoromethoxy)phenylhydrazone (FCCP), an uncoupling agent, 
was added at 60 min to measure maximal mitochondrial activity, and complete 
inhibition was induced at 90 min using a mixture of 0.5 μM antimycin A and 
rotenone, mitochondrial complex III and mitochondrial complex I inhibitors.
Free fatty acid oxidation was measured as previously described57. Briefly, 
after overnight incubation in substrate-limited medium containing 0.5 mM 
glucose to prime cells for exogenous fatty acid utilization, cells were incu-
bated in unbuffered DMEM supplemented as described above. Basal OCR 
was measured for 30 min, and then 200 μM palmitate (C16:0) was injected. 
Fatty acid oxidation was blocked at 60 min by injection of 100 μM etomoxir, a 
carnitine palmitoyltransferase I (CPT1) inhibitor. OCR attributable to exog-
enous fatty acid oxidation was defined as the difference between maximal 
palmitate-treated and minimal etomoxir-treated conditions.
A glycolysis stress test assay was conducted per the manufacturer’s instruc-
tions (Seahorse Bioscience). Briefly, cells were incubated in unbuffered DMEM 
supplemented with 2 mM glutamine and 1 mM sodium pyruvate (pH 7.4) for 1 
h at 37 °C in a non-CO2 incubator. The extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) 
was measured for 30 min in the absence of glucose; this served as the baseline 
measurement. We measured the rate of glycolysis by injecting 10 mM glucose 
at 30 min, followed by 1 μM oligomycin, blocking oxidative phosphoryla-
tion at 60 min. Finally, 100 mM 2DG, a nonmetabolized glucose analog, was 
injected at 90 min to competitively inhibit glycolysis. The increase in ECAR 
due to the addition of glucose was defined as the glycolysis rate, and the differ-
ence between oligomycin and 2DG treatments defined the maximal glycolytic 
capacity of the cells. Data are presented normalized to 104 cells.
Metabolic phenotype comparison was conducted per the manufacturer’s 
instructions (Seahorse Bioscience), as previously described (ref. 58). Briefly, 
absolute basal OCR and ECAR levels, normalized to protein concentration, 
were graphically plotted for naive, JFH-1-infected and sofosbuvir-treated pri-
mary human hepatocytes. The graphical representation indicates a relative 
metabolic phenotype between the three groups, the relative reliance on glyco-
lysis or oxidative phosphorylation.
Generation of transcription factor activity reporter library. We generated 
transcription factor activity reporters by cloning DNA response elements 
(i.e., PPRE and LXRE) upstream of a minimal CMV promoter. Binding of an 
activated transcription factor to its DNA response element induces the tran-
scription of destabilized copGFP with a half-life of 2 h, permitting the meas-
urement of both transcriptional activation and inhibition. Reporters were 
generated for 14 computationally identified transcription factors including 
HNF4α, PPARα, FXR, SREBP, LXRα, PPARγ and PXR. To validate their 
activity, we introduced reporters to Huh7.5.1 or HepG2 cells and stimulated 
them with a classical agonist (Supplementary Fig. 5).
SREBP1c, LXRα, and PPARγ pGreenFire1 activity reporters were pur-
chased from System Biosciences and validated in-house. Reporters con-
tained ATCACGTG, GGGTTACTGGCGGTCATTGTA and TGTA 
GGTCACGGTGACCTAC, respectively, upstream of a minimal CMV pro-
moter. The FXR reporter was constructed by PCR amplification of human 
genomic DNA from −145 to +86 of the BSEP promoter and subsequent cloning 
upstream of copGFP. The promoter of BSEP contains an FXR response element 
(GGGACATTGATCCT). The PPARα reporter was constructed by PCR amplifi-
cation of human genomic DNA from −562 to +1,890 of the human CPT1A gene 
and cloning upstream of copGFP. The PXR reporter construct was cloned from 
the human CYP3A4 promoter and was a kind gift from Dr. C. Liddle (University 
of Sydney, Australia). The promoter from the original luciferase construct was 
subcloned into the copGFP construct. We constructed the HNF4 reporter by 
cloning three HNF4 response elements (GGGTCAAAGGTCA) upstream of the 
minimal CMV promoter in the same pGreenFire1 reporter construct.
Reporter activity screen in infected Huh7.5.1 cells. Huh7.5.1 cells electropo-
rated with JC1-RFP or Pol− RNA were re-plated in a black 96-well plate at a 
density of 5 × 104 cells per well 24 h after electroporation. GreenFire lentivirus 
reporters were generated according to the manufacturer’s directions. Briefly, 
293T cells were cotransfected with a pGreenFire1 activity reporter plasmid, 
a plasmid expressing GAG-Pol, and a plasmid expressing VSV-G in a ratio of 
3:2:1. 24 μg of total DNA was diluted in 750 μL of OptiMEM and 25 μL of poly-
ethylenimine, mixed, allowed to settle for 5 min and added to 293T packaging 
cells cultured without antibiotics. Lentivirus was collected from the superna-
tant on the third day of culture, filtered through a 45-μm syringe filter, mixed 
with 4 ng/mL polybrene, and added at 100 μL/well to Huh7.5.1 cells expressing 
JC1-RFP or Pol− RNA. Lentivirus infection was repeated the following day and 
reached >80% efficiency based on the EGFP control.
24 h after the second infection (72 h after electroporation) the cells were 
imaged using Carl Zeiss LSM700 confocal microscope. Photos were analyzed 
using ImageJ software. Activity is presented as the number of GFP-positive 
cells above a preset threshold normalized to the Pol− control. We quantified 
HCV replication in the same samples by defining a low threshold, identifying 
HCV-positive cells, and measuring RFP fluorescence in HCV-positive cells 
divided by the area of the cells. A minimum of four regions were quantified 
for each experimental condition.
Intracellular lipid accumulation. Intracellular lipid accumulation was quan-
tified using Nile Red staining (Sigma Chemical) according to the manufactur-
er’s instructions. Briefly, cultures were fixed with 4% formaldehyde in PBS for 
 
20 min at room temperature, washed, treated with 1 μM Nile Red and coun-
terstained with Hoechst 33258 (Sigma Chemical). For intracellular lipid accu-
mulation in JC1-RFP-infected cultures, we used LipidTOX Green (Thermo 
Fisher Scientific) neutral lipid stain according to the manufacturer’s instruc-
tions.  Images were taken using a Carl Zeiss LSM700 confocal microscope 
and analyzed using ImageJ software. Lipid accumulation is presented as lipid 
intensity normalized to Hoechst. A minimum of four regions were quantified 
for each experimental condition.
Quantification of apoptosis. Quantitation of apoptotic cell nuclei was carried 
out with the DeadEnd Fluorometric TUNEL assay (Promega) according to the 
manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, cultures were fixed with 4% formaldehyde 
in PBS for 20 min at 4 °C, washed, and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X100 
for 5 min. Cultures were then equilibrated to room temperature for 10 min in 
buffer and treated with TdT reaction mixture for 60 min at 37 °C. The reaction 
was stopped using SSC for 15 min, at which point cells were washed and coun-
terstained with Hoechst. Images were taken using aCarl Zeiss LSM700 confo-
cal microscope and analyzed using ImageJ software. Apoptosis is presented as 
TUNEL intensity normalized to Hoechst. A minimum of four regions were 
quantified for each experimental condition.
Clinical HCV sample collection. Plasma and liver biopsy samples were 
obtained from individuals infected with HCV attending the Department of 
Gastroenterology and Hepatology of the University Hospital Duisburg-Essen, 
Germany, after obtaining written informed consent. The study was approved 
by the Institutional Review Board of the University of Essen, Germany (IRB 
08-3662). Inclusion criteria included a diagnosis of early HCV infection, 
defined as HCV RNA abundance greater than 100,000 IU/mL, but fibrosis 
stage 1 determined using FibroScan or pathological assessment. Patients with 
HIV or HBV coinfection, decompensated liver disease, or organ transplanta-
tion were excluded, as were those on medications that alter lipid metabolism.
Patient plasma samples. Plasma samples were collected from 15 people posi-
tive for HCV infection (genotypes 1a, 1b and 3a), after an overnight fast. 
Patient age ranged from 33 to 72 years; their ALT levels were below 190 U/l, 
and their fasting glucose levels were below 130 mg/dL. FibroScan results 
showed only minimal fibrosis.
Patient biopsy samples. Liver biopsy samples were collected from five patients, 
at early stages of HCV infection (genotypes 2b, 1a, 2a and 3a), after an over-
night fast. Patient age ranged from 25 to 39 years, and their GPT levels were 
below 112 U/l. FibroScan and histological assessment showed minimal fibrosis 
and low-grade inflammation in the liver samples. Normal human liver biopsy

for each constraint metabolic pathway defined above (Supplementary Table 4). 
 
We created the full regulatory network of each metabolic pathway in a similar 
way, but using all genes in each metabolic category.
Similarly, we searched for transcription factors regulating differentially 
expressed metabolic genes in response to HCV infection by testing the enrichment 
 
(FDR threshold of 5%) of transcription factor target genes with differentially 
expressed metabolic genes in vitro (total of 235 genes). To compare the in vivo 
and in vitro data, we tested each in vitro enriched factor for enrichment (FDR 
threshold of 5%) of its target genes with the set of metabolic genes differentially 
expressed in vivo (total of 189 genes; Supplementary Table 5).
HCV pseudoparticles (HCVpp). HCVpp were created by binding of HCV sur-
face receptors E1–E2 to 100-nm-diameter fluorescent beads. Green-fluorescent 
beads were purchased from Polysciences, Inc. Properly folded E1–E2 
 
heterodimers were recombinantly expressed and linked to beads as 
 
previously described47.
Full-length genotype 1 replicon cells. Huh7 clonal cells harboring a full-length 
genotype 1b replicon were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS 
and 250 μg/ml G418 in a 5% CO2–humidified incubator at 37 °C. Cells were 
grown to 90% confluence and exposed to 250 μM Medica16, 5 μM GW-9662, 
10 μM GW-6471, 100 μM BML-GR235, or 0.5% DMSO vehicle control for 
24 h. RNA was isolated and purified using a Macherey-Nagel NucleoSpin 
RNA II kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions. RNA concentration 
and purity were determined using a NanoDrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer 
(Thermo Fisher Scientific). Gene expression analysis was carried out using 
a Bio-Rad iScript One-Step RT-PCR kit on the Bio-Rad CFX96 Real-Time 
system. HCV (forward, 5′-AGAGCCATAGTGGTCTGCGGAA-3′; reverse, 
 
5′-AAATCTCCAGGCATTGAGCGGGTT-3′) gene transcription was evalu-
ated using the ΔΔCt method normalized to RPL32.
LIVE/DEAD quantification of cell viability. Huh7.5.1 cells and primary human 
hepatocytes cocultured with endothelial cells were stained using a fluorescent 
LIVE/DEAD viability assay (Invitrogen Life Sciences) in which the cytoplasm 
of live cells accumulates green-fluorescent calcein because of esterase activity, 
while the nuclei of dead cells are labeled red by ethidium homodimer owing to 
a loss of nuclear membrane integrity. Cells were quantified using ImageJ.
AFP secretion ELISA analysis. Control (Pol−) and JC1-infected Huh7.5.1 cells 
were treated with Medica16 and BI6015 for 24 h. Supernatant and cell lysate 
samples were collected. AFP concentration was analyzed using the AFP human 
ELISA kit (Abcam) according to the manufacturer’s directions. All data were 
normalized to total protein content using the Bradford assay.
Small interfering RNA analysis In Huh7.5.1 cells. Cells were plated in 12-well 
plates 24 h before transfection at 30–50% confluency. Transfection experi-
ments were performed using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). 50 μL solution 
of si 
RNAs and LF2K were prepared in Opti-Mem and allowed to mix for 30 
min before their addition to cells at final concentrations of 5–100 nM siRNA 
and 2.3 μg/mL LF2K. Cells were incubated in the transfection solutions at 37 
°C and 5% CO2. After 24 h, cells were washed twice with DPBS (Gibco), and 
EGFP fluorescence was quantified using a plate reader at 480 nm excitation/525 
nm emission. Fluorescence intensity was normalized to control wells that were 
treated with transfection reagent but no siRNA. Cytotoxicity was assessed by 
LIVE/DEAD staining.
Statistical analysis. Experiments were repeated two or three times with trip-
licate samples for each experimental condition. Data from representative 
 
experiments are presented, and similar trends were seen in multiple trials. 
Unless otherwise noted, a parametric two-tailed Student’s t-test was used to 
calculate significant differences between groups.
data from 19 patients were taken from GEO accession GSE14323 (ref. 58). 
 
The age for these subjects ranged from 9 to 66 years, and their cause of death 
was primarily head trauma.
Affymetrix gene arrays. In vitro RNA samples were tested on the Affymetrix 
GeneChip Human Exon 1.0 ST array at the Center for Genomic Technologies 
at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. In vivo RNA samples were isolated from 
snap-frozen liver biopsy samples and tested on Affymetrix GeneChip Human 
Genome U133A 2.0 array at the Genomic Facility of the University Hospital 
Essen, Germany. Both processes were carried out in an Affymetrix accredited 
facility according to the company instructions. GSE14323 samples deposited58 
were similarly collected and hybridized to the same Human Genome U133A 
2.0 array. Microarray data were deposited in GEO (GSE84587).
Gene expression analysis. After a robust multi-array average (RMA) proce-
dure and quantile normalization, the probes were filtered using BioDiscovery’s 
Nexus Expression software. Probes with a variance less than 0.2 and intensity 
less than 4.0 were removed. Differential expression of HCV-infected versus 
naive cells in vitro was evaluated via two-sample Student’s t-test, using a thresh-
old of P < 0.05 after Bonferoni correction for multiple hypotheses. Under these 
conditions, 893 genes were differentially regulated in vitro. Patient-to-patient 
differences required a more stringent test for the in vivo samples in order to 
reduce variability. We therefore carried out a two-sample Student’s t-test using 
a threshold of P < 0.01 after Bonferoni correction for multiple hypotheses and 
1.5-fold change. Under these conditions, a similar-sized group of 1,259 genes 
were found to be differentially regulated in vivo.
Assembly of metabolic categories. We defined metabolic categories by uniting 
various functional annotations chosen by hand, taken from GO20 or KEGG21 
(Supplementary Table 3). We assembled five sets for metabolic categories and 
a set of oxidative stress response genes. General liver metabolism was defined 
as the combination of all metabolic categories.
Functional annotations of gene expression. To functionally annotate differen-
tially expressed genes, we tested for their enrichment in functional gene sets. 
The general test for functional enrichment of the differentially expressed genes 
against various functional categories was done using the DAVID tool59. We 
tested the enrichment of differentially expressed genes with metabolic catego-
ries (defined above), using all genes expressed in vitro as the background list. 
Enrichment P values were calculated using Fisher’s exact test and with Bonferoni 
correction for multiple hypotheses. The analysis of the in vivo and in vitro data 
was done the same way, including only genes measured on both arrays.
Target genes of transcription factors. Transcription factor target genes were 
defined by TRANSFAC on the basis of expression analysis and binding data. 
We added CAR as a target gene of HNF4α on the basis of literature reports60. 
We found target genes in the liver for the factors HNF4α and CEBPα for 
validation using DNA binding data measured by ChIP-seq in primary human 
hepatocytes22. To determine target genes for these two factors, we used the 
binding-site locations previously determined22 and defined a gene as a target 
of the factor if we found a binding site 3,000 bp upstream or of the transcrip-
tion start site (TSS) of the gene. TSS locations were downloaded from the 
human genome version hg19 in the UCSC Genome Browser. We found target 
genes in the liver for the factors SREBF1, SREBF2 and their negative regula-
tor SCAP using their defined target genes based on overexpression in mouse 
primary hepatocytes23. We mapped the mouse target genes to their human 
orthologs using orthologous mapping from the MGI database (Informatics).
Transcriptional activity analysis. We conducted an unbiased search for tran-
scription factors differentially regulating metabolic pathways after HCV infec-
tion (Supplementary Table 4). A transcription factor was considered to be 
differentially regulating a pathway if its target genes were enriched with dif-
ferentially expressed genes within this pathway. Enrichment P values were cal-
culated using Fisher’s exact test and corrected for multiple hypotheses using a 
false discovery rate (FDR) threshold of 1%. The analysis was done separately
