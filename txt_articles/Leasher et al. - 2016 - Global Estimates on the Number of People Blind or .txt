People Blind or Visually Impaired
by Diabetic Retinopathy: A
Meta-analysis From 1990 to 2010
Diabetes Care 2016;39:1643–1649 | DOI: 10.2337/dc15-2171
OBJECTIVE
To estimate global and regional trends from 1990 to 2010 of the prevalence and
number of persons visually impaired specifically by diabetic retinopathy (DR), as a
complication of the precipitous trends in global diabetes, is fundamental for
health planning purposes.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS
The meta-analysis of published population studies from 1990 to 2012 for the Global
Burden of Disease Study 2010 (GBD) yielded estimated global regional trends in DR
among other causes of moderate and severe vision impairment (MSVI; presenting
visual acuity <6/18, ‡3/60) and blindness (presenting visual acuity <3/60).
RESULTS
Globally in 2010, out of overall 32.4 million blind and 191 million visually impaired
people, 0.8 million were blind and 3.7 million were visually impaired because of
DR, with an alarming increase of 27% and 64%, respectively, spanning the two
decades from 1990 to 2010. DR accounted for 2.6% of all blindness in 2010 and
1.9% of all MSVI worldwide, increasing from 2.1% and 1.3%, respectively, in 1990.
These figures were lower in regions with younger populations (<2% in East and
Southeast Asia and Oceania) than in high-income regions (North America, West-
ern Europe, and Australasia) with relatively aging populations (>4%).
CONCLUSIONS
The number of persons with visual impairment due to DR worldwide is rising and
represents an increasing proportion of all blindness/MSVI causes. Age-standardized
prevalence of DR-related blindness/MSVI was higher in sub-Saharan Africa and South
Asia. One out of 39 blind people had blindness due to DR, and 1 out of 52 visually
impaired people had visual impairment due to DR.
Data on the prevalence of visual impairment and blindness, its causes, and its
changes over time is of high importance for public health issues. On the basis of
previous large-scale population-based studies and meta-analyses, diabetic retinop-
athy (DR) has been recognized as one of the most common and important causes for
visual impairment and blindness (1–19). These studies in general showed that DR
was the leading cause of blindness globally among working-aged adults and there-
fore has a significant socioeconomic impact (20–22). Although timely treatment of
DR can reduce the risk of visual loss by 60%, the proportion of blindness due to DR

META-ANALYSIS
 ranged from 3 to 7% in the Southeast
Asia and Western Pacific regions and
was as high as 15–17% in developed re-
gionssuchastheAmericasandEurope(23).
A previous meta-analysis (21) summa-
rizing 35 studies with more than 20,000
patients with diabetes estimated a prev-
alence of any DR of 34.6%, of diabetic
macular edema of 6.8%, and of vision-
threating DR of 10.2% within the diabetes
population. The prevalence estimates of
any DR and vision-threatening DR varied
with ethnicity and were highest in African
Americans and lowest in Asians. By ex-
trapolating these prevalence rates to
the 2010 world diabetes population, Yau
et al. (21) estimated that ;93 million
people had some DR and 28 million peo-
ple had sight-threatening stages of DR.
However, this meta-analysis did not ad-
dress the prevalence of visual impairment
and blindness due to DR and thus the
impact of DR on the general population.
No previous studies assessed changes in
the prevalence of DR-related blindness
from 1990 to 2010 or the number of peo-
ple functionally affected applying the
samemethodologyacrossalltimeperiods.
We therefore conducted the present
meta-analysis of all available population-
based studies performed worldwide
within the last two decades as part of
the Global Burden of Disease Study
2010 (GBD) to estimate the number
of people affected by blindness and visual
impairment. The global prevalence,
causes, and regional estimates have been
reported previously (24,25). Because the
numbers of persons living with diabetes
and DR have triggered a global public
health response, we believe that it is
imperative to present the figures we esti-
mated specifically for blindness and visual
impairment due to DR in the present anal-
ysis. Along with the global and regional
figures, we offer the temporal trends
from 1990 to 2010; we examine regional
differencesintheprevalenceofDR-related
blindness and moderate and severe vision
impairment (MSVI); and we consider the
implications of how the number of people
with DR-related blindness and visual im-
pairment compares with the number of
people with blindness and visual impair-
ment due to other eye diseases.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS
The GBD methodology is detailed else-
where (24–26). Herein we shall only re-
view the methodology pertinent to the
present analysis of the prevalence of vi-
sual impairment due to DR. A systemic
literature review yielded 14,908 relevant
articles published between 1980 and
2012 primarily identified by searching
Medline, Embase, and the World Health
Organization (WHO) library information
system. (The full search strategy is in-
cluded in Supplementary Appendix 1.) Of
those, 243 population-based studies were
analyzed afterreviewby an expertpanelof
ophthalmologists, optometrists, and oph-
thalmic epidemiologists. The search terms
applied included “blindness,” “visual im-
pairment,” “population,” “eye,” “survey,”
and a list of ocular disorders (24,25). Ad-
ditionally, personal communication with
principal investigators identified in the lit-
erature search provided additional un-
published data sources (24,25).
In the GBD, blindness was defined as
presenting visual acuity ,3/60 and MSVI
as presentingvisual acuity,6/18, $3/60.
Population-based studies that reported
prevalence of visual impairment and
blindness disaggregated by cause (128
studies) provided the basic data to calcu-
late the proportion of blindness and MSVI
due to DR (20 studies) in addition to other
causes such as cataract, age-related mac-
ular degeneration, glaucoma, trachoma,
or undercorrection of refractive error
(24). Ten of the 21 (47.6%) GBD regions
(27) were represented with data on
DR-related blindness/MSVI (Australasia,
Central and Western Europe, North
America, Caribbean, Tropical Latin
America, Oceania, and South, East, and
Southeast Asia). On a country level,
studies were available for 14 out of
191 countries.
Trends in causes of vision impairment
were calculated by age in 5-year in-
crements, sex, and GBD region. We ad-
ditionally performed an analysis of
uncertainties. The statistical analysis in-
cluded the data identification and acces-
sibility; the estimation of fractions for
each cause stratified by the severity of
vision impairment, sex, age, and region;
and the application of cause fractions to
the prevalence of all-cause presenting vi-
sion impairment (24). The statistical anal-
ysis applied the DisMod-MR (https://
github.com/ihmeuw/dismod_mr) model
to calculate the fraction of vision impair-
ment due to DR and the other causes
mentioned above (24). The DisMod-MR
is a negative binomial regression model in-
cluding the following elements: covariates
that predict variation in the true propor-
tion of vision impairment from each dis-
ease (e.g., year); fixed effects that adjust
for definitional differences (e.g., whether
the causes of presenting vs. best-corrected
vision impairment were reported); a hier-
archical model structure that fits random
intercepts in individual countries derived
from the data observed in the country, in
its region, and in other regions on the basis
of the availability and consistency of
country- and region-specific data; age-
specificfixedeffectsallowingforanonlinear
age pattern; and a fixed effect for data on
males. The fraction of blindness and visual
impairment due to DR resulted from fitting
one DisMod-MR model using three covari-
ates: an indicator variable describing
whether the data were for blindness or
for MSVI, an indicator variable describing
whetherthedatawerebasedonpresenting
visual acuity or best-corrected visual
acuity measurements, and a country-
level covariate reflecting health systems
access. Two sets of predictions for DR
were generated, one for best-corrected
blindness and one for best-corrected
MSVI. Age-standardized prevalence rep-
resented the WHO reference population
(28). The generation of numbers of peo-
ple with vision impairment and blindness
due to DR reflects each region’s popula-
tion size and age structure (24,25).
RESULTS
Our overall estimates suggest that 32.4
million people were blind and 191 million
people were visually impaired worldwide
in 2010 (24). Of these, 833,690 people
were blind and 3.7 million were visually
impaired because of DR (Table 1). Data
for 1990 are presented in Supplementary
Appendix 2. From 1990 to 2010, the num-
ber of people with blindness due to DR
increased by ;176,000 or 27% and the
number with visual impairment due to
DR increased by 1.4 million or 64% (Table
1 and Supplementary Appendix 2). In
2010, South Asia was home to 35% of
those with blindness due to DR (294,811)
and 40% of those with visual impairment
due to DR (1.5 million) (Table 1, Supple-
mentary Appendix 2, and Figs. 1 and 2). Of
those aged 50 years and older, the num-
ber of people with blindness due to
DR increased from 574,000 in 1990 to
731,000 in 2010 and the number of peo-
ple with DR-related visual impairment
increased from 1,858,000 in 1990 to
3,074,000 in 2010.

 DR caused 2.6% of all cases with
blindness worldwide in 2010 and 1.9%
of all cases for MSVI (Table 1). The per-
centage of blindness caused by DR var-
ied regionally from ,2% in East and
Southeast Asia and Oceania to $5.5%
in Southern Latin America (Table 1).
World regions with older populations
such as the high-income regions, South-
ern Latin America, and Eastern and West-
ern Europe, as compared with regions
with relatively younger populations,
showed a higher percentage of blindness
caused by DR (Table 1).
Compared with 1990, of all global
blindness causes, the percentage caused
by DR increased from 2.1 to 2.6% in
2010, and of global MSVI causes, the

 percentage caused by DR increased
from 1.3 to 1.9% in 2010 (Table 1 and
Supplementary Appendix 2). The in-
crease in the percentage of global
blindness caused by DR from 1990 to
2010 took place in all world regions ex-
cept those higher-income regions of Asia
Pacific, Australasia, Western Europe, and
North America where a slight decrease
occurred (Table 1 and Supplementary
Appendix 2).
Age-standardized prevalence of
DR-related blindness and MSVI in those
aged $50 years was relatively un-
changed worldwide. Age-standardized
prevalence of blindness due to DR
changed to 0.0518% (95% uncertainty
interval [UI] 0.0440, 0.0690) in adults
aged $50 years in 2010 from 0.0652%
(95% UI 0.0565, 0.0812) in 1990. Age-
standardized prevalence of MSVI due to
DR changed to 0.2185% (95% UI 0.1843,
0.3135) in 2010 from 0.2093% (95% UI
0.1689, 0.2635) in 1990 (Table 1, Sup-
plementary Appendix 2, and Figs. 1
and 2).
On a regional basis, in 2010, the age-
standardized prevalence of blindness
related to DR in those aged $50 years
was highest in West sub-Saharan Africa
(0.1889%) and North Africa/Middle East
(0.1599%), followed by East sub-
Saharan Africa (0.1366%), and 0.1% or
less in all other regions (Table 1). In
2010, the age-standardized prevalence
ofMSVIduetoDRinthoseaged$50years
was highest in South Asia (0.5112%), West
sub-Saharan Africa (0.5002%), and North
Africa/Middle East (1.0%) and lowest in
the high-income regions such as North
America (Table 1).
CONCLUSIONS
DR ranks as the fifth most common
cause of global blindness and of global
MSVI (25). Regardless of the relatively
low percentage of ,3% of all global
blindness and MSVI being caused by
DR, this analysis estimates that, in
2010, 1 out of every 39 blind people
had blindness due to DR and 1 out of
every 52 people had visual impairment
due to DR. In adults aged $50 years, the
global age-standardized prevalence in
2010 was 0.05% for DR-related blind-
ness and 0.22% for DR-related MSVI.
The prevalence of any DR has been
previously reported in a number of
population-based studies (1–23). How-
ever, few addressed the prevalence of
DR-related blindness at the global level.
Within the period from 1990 to 2010,
the age-standardized prevalence of DR-
related blindness and MSVI did not
markedly change as a global mean. This
is in contrast to the global decrease in
the age-standardized prevalence of cat-
aract, undercorrected refractive error,
and trachoma (24,25). Our study demon-
strated regional differences such as the
increase in age-standardized prevalence
observed in sub-Saharan regions and
how the highest age-standardized prev-
alence of DR-related blindness and MSVI
was in the regions of North Africa/
Middle East, sub-Saharan Africa, and
South Asia and the lowest prevalence
was in the high-income regions. Similar
interregional findings were reported in a
recent meta-analysis (21) where preva-
lence estimates of any DR and of vision-
threatening DR were highest in African
Americans and lowest in Asians.
We propose that the phenomenon of
an increase in numbers of people with
vision loss due to DR with a relatively
unchanged age-standardized preva-
lence of vision loss due to DR from
1990 to 2010 globally can be attributed
to the increasing population and aver-
age age in most regions coupled with
falling death rates (27).
Our data suggest that the percentage
of blindness and MSVI attributable to
DR was lower in low-income regions
with younger populations than in high-
income regions with older populations.
There are several reasons that may ex-
plain this observation. First, low-income
societies may have a higher percentage
of unoperated cataract or undercor-
rected refractive error–related blind-
ness and MSVI (25), which is probably
related to access to visual and ocular
health services. Therefore, the propor-
tional increase in blindness and MSVI
attributable to DR may be rising because
of the decreasing proportion attribut-
able to cataract (25) as a result of the
increasing availability of cataract sur-
gery in many parts of the world (29)
during the past decade. Improved visu-
alization of the fundus afforded by cat-
aract surgery should also improve the
detection of DR. The increase in the per-
centage of global blindness caused by
DR within the last two decades took
place in all world regions except West-
ern Europe and high-income North
America where there was a slight
decrease. This decrease may reflect the
effect of intensified prevention and
treatment of DR possibly in part due
to the introduction of intravitreal in-
jections of steroids and anti-VEGF (vas-
cular endothelial growth factor) drugs
(30,31).
Second, in regions with poor medical
infrastructure, patients with diabetes
may not live long enough to experience
DR (32). This reduces the number of pa-
tients with diabetes, and, furthermore,
it reduces the number of patients with
DR-related vision loss. Studies in the lit-
erature have reported that the preva-
lence of severe DR decreased from
1990 to 2010 (21) while the prevalence
of diabetes simultaneously increased
(27), which implies a reduction in the
prevalence of severe DR per person
with diabetes. This paradox is even
more remarkable if one takes into ac-
count that duration of diabetes is one
of the most important risk factors for
the development of DR and for the de-
velopment of severe DR. For example, in
Central India (19) the prevalence of DR
within the diabetes population was 5%,
which was considerably lower than the
global prevalence of 34.6%. In that rural
population in Central India, the preva-
lence of diabetes in 2006/2008 de-
creased after the age of 60 years, and
the prevalence of DR was exceptionally
low compared with populations in in-
dustrialized countries. Differences be-
tween regions in the screening and
management of DR and diabetes, socio-
economic factors, medical infrastruc-
ture, ethnic differences, and variation
in genetic susceptibility for DR may
also explain some of these differences
(22). Interestingly, the age-standardized
prevalence of DR-related blindness and
MSVI were as low in South Asia as in
high-income regions, despite marked
regional differences in socioeconomic
levels and medical infrastructure.
Third, as in the case of Central India
described above (19), younger popula-
tions may have a lower prevalence of
diabetes (33). If we apply our prevalence
results to the number of people with
diabetes reported by Danaei et al. (34),
;350 million, our figures would suggest
that ;0.2% (or 834,000 people) of the
350 million were blind because of DR
and that 1.1% (or 3.7 million individuals)
of the 350 million with diabetes were
visually impaired because of DR. These

 percentages are much lower than the
aforementioned figure of 35% of all pa-
tients with diabetes having any form of
DR as reported in the meta-analysis by
Yau et al. (21) in 2012. In that meta-analysis,
the prevalence of vision-threatening DR,
defined as the presence of proliferative
DR or diabetic macular edema, was
10.2%. Assuming that the data in the
meta-analysis of our study are also valid,
our data indicate that about 10% of the
individuals with vision-threatening DR
experience a marked reduction in visual
acuity to levels of visual impairment and
that ;2% of them become bilaterally
blind.
Therefore, considering further eco-
nomic development in rural regions, im-
provements in medical infrastructure, the
general global demographic transition to
elderly populations, and the association
between increasing economic develop-
ment and obesity,we project the increase
in the proportion of DR-related blindness
and MSVIto continue to rise in the future.
These findings can be used to develop
strategies for preserving the vision of
adults with diabetes, and several of these
are advanced in Table 2.
Several limitations of our study should
be mentioned. First, as also noted in our
previous publications on the global prev-
alence of vision loss (24,25), a major lim-
itation was that most country-years were
without data or only had subnational
data. Second, some data sources did not
report prevalence by age. To use these
data, we imputed age-specific cause frac-
tions, assuming that the age pattern of
visually impaired inthe study represented
the modeled age pattern of visually im-
pairedinthe country where the study was
conducted (24,25). Third, recommended
WHO surveillance protocol dictated that
population-based studies reported one
cause as the principal cause for an indi-
vidualexaminedinthat particular studyin
order to arrive at the causal prevalence.
When there were multiple disorders con-
tributing equally to visual loss, only the
‘‘most readily curable’’ or the ‘‘most eas-
ily preventable’’ was recorded (35). This
approach has the potential to underesti-
mate the impact of DR when the patient
presented with cataract and underesti-
mate the burden of cataract when pa-
tients also had an uncorrected refractive
error (36). Fourth, some studies reporting
population blindness had a relatively
small sample size, with a relatively small
proportion of visual impairment attrib-
uted to DR. The DisMod-MR model, how-
ever, took into account power estimates
so that studies with small sample sizes
influenced the estimates less than studies
with large sample sizes. For this reason,
the uncertainty intervals of cause-specific
prevalence estimates are relatively large.
Strengths of this study design as com-
pared with previous meta-analytical liter-
ature reviews (37) included the amount
of population-based data accessed and
used, analysis of trends in the causes of
vision impairment and blindness, incor-
poration of nonlinear age trends and ac-
counting for data that were not reported
by age, and systematic quantitative anal-
ysis and reporting of uncertainty.
Global estimates of the prevalence and
number of persons with visual impair-
ment specifically caused by DR as a com-
plication of the precipitous trends in
global diabetes are fundamental data
for health planning purposes. Although
DR is estimated to affect nearly 100 mil-
lion people globally and nearly 30 million
have vision-threatening stages of disease,
our data suggest that less than 1 million
are currently blind and 4 million visually
impaired. The current global strategy of
prioritizing more treatable eye diseases
such as cataract and uncorrected refrac-
tive error may reduce avoidable blind-
ness in more people and may be more
successful, cost efficient, and safe; how-
ever, it is imperative to plan for a
greater share of blindness and visual im-
pairment due to DR and to develop strat-
egies (Table 2) to prevent DR and
subsequent vision loss.
