Introduction
Infections caused by aerobic Gram-negative bacteria are prevalent and dangerous. As a group, these organ-
isms are the most common etiology of nosocomial infections, including most cases of hospital-acquired 
pneumonia, ventilator-associated pneumonia and healthcare-associated pneumonia, and they are import-
ant causes of morbidity and death in hospitalized patients (1). Dissemination of these organisms from the 
primary site of infection to the bloodstream is especially associated with mortality (2, 3). The progressive 
rise in antibiotic resistance among Gram-negative bacteria, particularly in the healthcare setting, has criti-
cally diminished the available treatment options for these infections. Better mechanistic understanding of 
the host-pathogen interplay during Gram-negative infections has the potential to lead to novel therapeutic 
strategies to augment the diminishing armamentarium of traditional antibiotics.
Iron is an essential component of many proteins and a required nutrient for nearly all organisms. In 
biological systems, free iron ions are present at extremely low concentrations, and the competition for iron 
between pathogens and the host is important to the outcome of many infections (4). While the iron acqui-
sition mechanisms of aerobic Gram-negative bacteria are known to be essential to their virulence (5), the 
host mechanisms of iron restriction in these infections are incompletely defined.
Under homeostatic conditions, plasma iron is rapidly turned over with a half-life of < 1 hour, being 
continuously utilized in erythropoiesis and replenished by splenic macrophages that scavenge iron from 
senescent erythrocytes (6). The hormone hepcidin is the key regulator of plasma iron concentration that 
acts by mediating the degradation of the only known cellular iron exporter, ferroportin, thus trapping 
Gram-negative pneumonia is a dangerous illness, and bacterial dissemination to the bloodstream 
during the infection is strongly associated with death. Antibiotic resistance among the causative 
pathogens has resulted in diminishing treatment options against this infection. Hepcidin is the 
master regulator of extracellular iron availability in vertebrates, but its role in the context of 
host defense is undefined. We hypothesized that hepcidin-mediated depletion of extracellular 
iron during Gram-negative pneumonia protects the host by limiting dissemination of bacteria to 
the bloodstream. During experimental pneumonia, hepcidin was induced in the liver in an IL-6–
dependent manner and mediated a rapid decline in plasma iron. In contrast, hepcidin-deficient 
mice developed a paradoxical increase in plasma iron during infection associated with profound 
susceptibility to bacteremia. Incubation of bacteria with iron-supplemented plasma enhanced 
bacterial growth in vitro, and systemic administration of iron to WT mice similarly promoted 
increased susceptibility to bloodstream infection. Finally, treatment with a hepcidin analogue 
restored hypoferremia in hepcidin-deficient hosts, mediated bacterial control, and improved 
outcomes. These data show hepcidin induction during pneumonia to be essential to preventing 
bacterial dissemination by limiting extracellular iron availability. Hepcidin agonists may  
represent an effective therapy for Gram-negative infections in patients with impaired hepcidin 
production or signaling.

iron inside cells and reducing extra-
cellular iron (7). During homeosta-
sis, hepcidin is induced by elevated 
extracellular and intracellular iron 
levels via SMAD4 signaling, and is 
inhibited by anemia and hypoxia. 
During inflammation, hepcidin is 
induced as an acute-phase reactant 
by IL-6 and Activin B via STAT3 
and SMAD4, respectively (8, 9). In 
the context of inflammation, hep-
cidin mediates acute hypoferremia, 
which is posited to be a defense 
mechanism against infectious dis-
ease; continual hepcidin production 
in this setting can infamously cause 
anemia of chronic inflammation. 
The role of hepcidin in disorders of 
iron metabolism is well established, 
but its contribution to antimicrobial 
host defenses is an emerging field. 
For example, hepcidin appears to 
protect the host against malaria but 
to promote the growth of pathogens 
that reside within the intracellular 
niche of macrophages (10). Hep-
cidin-mediated 
hypoferremia 
is 
essential for protection of the host 
against Vibrio vulnificus in a murine 
model (11), consistent with the clin-
ical observation that individuals 
with iron-overload conditions are 
uniquely susceptible to this organ-
ism (12). In contrast, the role of hep-
cidin as a general defense against 
common bacterial infections, such 
as those caused by Enterbacteriace-
ae, remains unknown.
We reasoned that the bloodstream dissemination of microorganisms from the primary site of infection 
is a critical complication in Gram-negative bacterial infections. In the context of pneumonia, as well as other 
focal infections caused by aerobic Gram-negative bacilli, bacteremia is strongly associated with sepsis and 
death (13, 14). We therefore tested the hypothesis that hepcidin-mediated depletion of extracellular iron 
during Gram-negative pneumonia protects the host by limiting dissemination of bacteria to the bloodstream.
Results
Plasma iron is suppressed during bacterial pneumonia. We used a well-described model of Klebsiella pneumonia 
caused by a virulent strain of bacteria, delivered directly into the trachea of sedated experimental mice (15, 
16). We first characterized the effect of Klebsiella pneumonia on iron metabolism in WT mice. As expected, 
plasma iron concentration decreased quickly in WT mice following infection (Figure 1A), similar to prior 
reports with acute inflammatory stimuli (9). To assess the availability of iron to bacteria in the lungs, we 
also measured heme-associated and non–heme-associated iron levels in whole lung homogenates (which 
includes both intra- and extracellular iron), and in the extracellular space, in the bronchoalveolar lavage 
(BAL) supernatant (Figure 1, B and C). We found that most lung iron was intracellular, and extracellular 
iron levels were low and did not change appreciably during infection.

Increased iron availability worsens the outcome of  infection. To determine whether iron availability influences 
host defense during the course of infection, we tested the effect of transient increase in extracellular iron 
availability, achieved by i.p. injection of ferric ammonium citrate, on the outcome of Klebsiella pneumo-
nia. Mice treated with iron prior to intrapulmonary K. pneumoniae challenge developed transient elevation 
in plasma iron that resolved completely within 12 hours (Figure 1D) without influencing lung iron (Sup-
plemental Figure 1; supplemental material available online with this article; https://doi.org/10.1172/jci.
insight.92002DS1), consistent with prior studies indicating that excess iron is rapidly cleared from the blood 
and redistributed to the BM, spleen, and liver (6). This transient increase in iron availability during the first 
24 hours after infection was associated with a markedly increased mortality from pneumonia associated with 
increased bacterial burden in the lung and the blood (Figure 1, E and F). Since WT mice developed hypo-
ferremia upon infection with K. pneumoniae, and excess iron was associated with poor infection outcome, we 
hypothesized that endogenous iron regulation was important for controlling infection.
Hepcidin regulates plasma iron during bacterial pneumonia by an IL-6–dependent mechanism. To assess the role 
of hepcidin in mediating hypoferremia during pneumonia, we began by characterizing hepcidin expression 
during the infection. Infection resulted in a marked increase in hepcidin protein levels in plasma, in parallel 
with the development of hypoferremia (Figure 2A). Hepcidin protein concentration also increased in the

lung but at relatively low concentrations (~15 ng 
in the entire lung, as compared with ~1,500 ng/
ml of plasma on day 3; Figure 2A). The liver is the 
dominant source of hepcidin at baseline (17, 18), 
but hepcidin can be induced in leukocytes and air-
way epithelial cells in response to inflammatory 
stimuli under in vitro conditions (19–21). We thus 
measured hepcidin transcription in the liver, blood, 
and lungs during infection and found a robust induction of hepcidin mRNA in the liver (Figure 2B) but not in 
peripheral blood leukocytes or lungs (Figure 2, C and D), suggesting that liver is the main source of hepcidin 
during the infection and elevations in lung hepcidin protein likely represent extravasation from the blood.
The cytokine IL-6 is a key inducer of acute phase proteins in the liver and an important regulator of 
hepcidin expression in vivo (9). IL-6 is induced in the lungs in this model of pneumonia (22). We found that 
immunoneutralization of IL-6 resulted in higher blood and lung bacterial burden 2 days following infection 
(Figure 3A). In addition, IL-6 neutralization abrogated the increase in plasma hepcidin during the infection 
and eliminated the associated hypoferremia (Figure 3, B and C), indicating that hepcidin induction during 
pneumonia is dependent on IL-6.
Hepcidin mediates hypoferremia during bacterial pneumonia and is required for survival. Reduced availability of 
plasma iron in the context of acute inflammation can occur as a result of both hepcidin-dependent and -inde-
pendent mechanisms (23–25). We therefore tested the contribution of hepcidin in regulation of plasma iron 
levels in the context of bacterial pneumonia. In contrast to reduction in plasma iron during infection in WT 
mice, plasma iron in hepcidin-deficient mice became more elevated during the infection (Figure 4A), indicat-
ing that hepcidin is essential for controlling plasma iron levels following infection. Consistent with reports of 
tissue iron overload in hepcidin-deficient mice (18, 26), we found elevated lung iron levels in hepcidin-defi-
cient as compared with WT mice, but these values did not change over the infection period (Figure 4B).
We next assessed the contribution of hepcidin-mediated iron sequestration to host defense against K. 
pneumoniae and found that hepcidin-deficient animals were markedly more susceptible to bacterial pneu-
monia, demonstrating 100% mortality compared with 50% mortality in WT controls (Figure 4C), compa-
rable to mice treated with exogenous iron during infection (Figure 1, D and E). Hepcidin-deficient mice 
exhibited 23% greater incidence of bacteremia and > 100-fold higher median blood bacterial concentration, 
as well as ~10-fold higher bacterial burden in the lungs and liver as compared with WT mice (Figure 4D).
Since the hepatocytes in hepcidin-deficient animals are iron loaded, we reasoned that the increase 
of iron in infected hepcidin–/– mice could originate from greater release of iron from damaged hepato-
cytes. We therefore quantified alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase in the blood of 
infected mice to assess liver damage and found neither enzyme to be elevated in hepcidin–/– as compared 
with WT mice in the context of infection (Supplemental Figure 2), arguing against disproportionate

hepatic injury as a contributor to worse 
outcomes in hepcidin-deficient hosts.
In order to assess whether the bene-
ficial effects of hepcidin are dependent 
on iron, we used established protocols 
to induce severe iron-deficiency in hep-
cidin-deficient mice (27). We found that 
iron-depleted hepcidin–/– animals did 
not develop hyperferremia during infec-
tion, had lower body iron stores than 
WT mice, and were no more susceptible 
to infection compared with WT mice 
(Supplemental Figure 3, A and B). Tak-
en together, these data suggest that the 
hepcidin-mediated control of bacterial growth during infection is iron dependent.
Excess iron promotes the growth of  K. pneumoniae in plasma. To assess whether the increased susceptibil-
ity of hepcidin-deficient mice to infection was attributable to increased bacterial growth in the high-iron 
environment of the plasma, we assessed the effect of iron supplementation on the in vitro growth of K. 
pneumoniae in human plasma. Supplementing agar composed of 90% human plasma with ferric ammo-
nium citrate at physiologically relevant concentrations incrementally raised the transferrin saturation of 
the sample, resulting in the appearance of non–transferrin-associated labile pool iron (Figure 5A). The 
appearance of labile pool iron at transferrin saturation greater than 70% is consistent with prior reports (28, 
29). K. pneumoniae growth was suppressed in plasma but was permitted by iron supplementation, consistent 
with reports that transferrin inhibits bacterial growth (30) (Figure 5B). Interestingly, we found that, in plas-
ma preparations from 3 independent donors, addition of ferric iron resulted in K. pneumoniae out-growth 
coincided with the appearance of labile iron in the plasma, rather than with the total amount of iron citrate 
added. These data suggest that ferric ammonium citrate supports K. pneumoniae growth in plasma by pro-
viding iron, rather than acting as a carbon or nitrogen source.
We next sought to test the hypothesis that, during in vivo infection, elevated plasma iron is sufficient to 
enhance growth of blood-borne bacteria. To test this, we subjected WT mice with an i.p. injection of PBS 
or ferric ammonium citrate prior to i.v. challenge with K. pneumoniae. After 24 hours, mice treated with 
ferric ammonium citrate had higher blood bacterial content than mice treated with PBS, indicating that

elevated plasma iron directly mediates increased growth of K. pneumoniae in the blood stream (Figure 5C). 
Interestingly, mice treated with ferric ammonium citrate also had higher bacterial burdens in the lungs. We 
interpret this as evidence that, in mice with increased bacteremia, bacterial seeding of the lung from the 
bloodstream contributes to higher lung bacterial content. Similar to prior reports (31), mice treated with 
iron also had marked elevation of plasma hepcidin as compared with mice treated with PBS in response 
to acute iron loading (Figure 5D), indicating that hepcidin induction alone is not sufficient to protect mice 
from fatal infection if plasma iron levels are high and supporting the hypothesis that the beneficial effects of 
hepcidin are mediated via induction of hypoferremia, rather than an iron-independent effect.
Hepcidin-deficient mice have intact cellular immunity against Klebsiella. Iron deficiency and iron overload have 
complex effects on immune responses (32), and phagocytes from iron-overloaded hosts may have altered 
antibacterial properties that could contribute to impaired host defenses of hepcidin-deficient mice inde-
pendent of the effects of acute hyperferremia on bacteria. In order to assess the functionality of the innate 
immune response in hepcidin-deficient mice, we analyzed leukocyte populations in the blood and BAL (Fig-
ure 6, A–F). We found similar concentrations of circulating neutrophils, and Ly6Chi and Ly6Clo monocytes 
in WT and hepcidin-deficient mice at baseline and 2 days following infection. The number of BAL alveolar 
macrophages, neutrophils, and monocyte-derived macrophages were also similar between WT and hepci-
din-deficient hosts, both at baseline and following infection, arguing against a defect in leukocyte quantity 
or recruitment in the absence of hepcidin. Since oxidative burst is an iron-dependent process, we compared 
the generation of reactive oxygen species in lung and blood leukocyte populations and found no difference 
between infected WT and hepcidin-deficient mice (Supplemental Figure 4). Similarly, neutrophils from WT 
and hepcidin-deficient mice exhibited comparable ex vivo bacterial killing (Figure 6G). While these data do

not formally exclude the possibility that hepcidin deficiency impairs the immune system in some other way, 
they suggest intact cellular innate immune mechanisms against K. pneumoniae in hepcidin–/– mice.
Restoring hypoferremia is sufficient to protect hepcidin-deficient mice from infection. Impaired hepcidin produc-
tion is common in the clinical setting — for example, in patients with liver disease (33–36) — and our data 
suggests a mechanism by which these hosts may be predisposed to Gram-negative bacterial infections. As 
proof-of-principle of a potential therapeutic approach in this population, we assessed the effect of minihep-
cidin, a hepcidin analogue, on the outcome of K. pneumoniae infection in hepcidin-deficient hosts. We used 
a previously described synthetic peptide based on the 9 N-terminal amino acids of the hepcidin molecule, 
which are necessary and sufficient to induce the degradation of ferroportin (37, 38). Daily treatment with 
the hepcidin analogue beginning on the day of infection resulted in markedly lowered plasma iron levels 
in infected hepcidin-deficient mice as compared with vehicle-treated controls without affecting the total 
lung iron content (Figure 7, A and B), consistent with utilization of plasma iron in erythropoiesis (6). The 
treatment also resulted in > 99% reduction in median lung and blood bacterial burden in infected hepci-
din-deficient mice and 40% reduction in mortality compared with vehicle alone (Figure 7, C and D). These 
data provide evidence that the acute induction of hypoferremia during infection in hepcidin-deficient hosts 
may represent a plausible therapeutic strategy.
Discussion
Although the competition for iron is thought to be a general feature of antimicrobial host response, the mech-
anisms and contribution of iron restriction in most infections are undefined. In particular, hepcidin-mediated 
hypoferremia has only been implicated in host defense against V. vulnificus, an organism with specific affinity 
for iron-overloaded hosts, but its role in defense against common pathogens and in normal hosts is not known 
(10). We showed that hepcidin was necessary for protection against bacterial dissemination in Gram-negative 
pneumonia and that treatment with iron citrate was sufficient to permit bacterial outgrowth in WT mice. 
Finally, we showed that treatment with minihepcidin restored hypoferremia and rescued iron-overloaded, 
hepcidin-deficient hosts from the infection. Taken together, these data suggest that hepcidin-mediated iron 
sequestration protects against Gram-negative pneumonia.
Our data suggest that the hepcidin-dependent protection was mediated by reducing plasma iron, as indi-
cated by our observation that WT mice treated with iron citrate were susceptible to K. pneumoniae infection 
despite robust hepcidin induction (Figure 1, E and F) and that hepcidin-deficient mice were protected from

infection if starved of iron (Supplemental Figure 3B). While there may be iron-independent effects of ferric 
ammonium citrate administration that we have not accounted for, such as bacterial fermentation of citrate, 
we are encouraged that the phenotype of iron citrate–treated mice is remarkably similar to that of hepcidin–/– 
mice in terms of death and bacterial burden. Furthermore, we found that hepcidin-deficient mice treated 
with minihepcidin were robustly protected from infection despite having tissue iron overload, suggesting that 
restriction of iron in the plasma is sufficient for protection (Figure 7, C and D). Hepcidin exhibits antimicro-
bial activity against a broad array of pathogens in vitro, and an iron-independent direct microbicidal role for 
hepcidin has thus been suggested (17, 39, 40). Arguing against such a direct microbicidal role, we report plas-
ma hepcidin levels at concentrations much lower than those required to mediate killing in vitro (39). Similarly, 
administration of a hepcidin analogue, which lacks the β-defensin motif required for its antimicrobial activity 
(37), rescued the phenotype of hepcidin-deficient mice (Figure 7, C and D).
Although hepcidin-independent mechanisms of hypoferremia have been reported after challenge with 
inflammatory stimuli (23, 25, 41), we found that hypoferremia during pneumonia was completely abro-
gated in hepcidin-deficient mice, and in fact, plasma iron levels became elevated following infection in 
hepcidin-deficient mice. Our use of an infectious agent, rather than sterile inflammatory stimuli used in 
other reports, may account for this difference. We speculate that this increase in plasma iron levels reflects 
decreases in iron consumption by cytokine-suppressed erythropoiesis (24) and release of iron from intra-
cellular sources damaged by infection, such as the liver (42). We thus propose a model in which infections 
result in a tendency toward increased extracellular iron that benefits the pathogen, and the protective role 
of inflammation-mediated hepcidin induction is to counteract this phenomenon. Furthermore, while hep-
cidin can be produced by leukocytes, airway epithelial cells and other tissues(19–21), our results indicate 
that hepcidin is predominantly produced by the liver and circulates systemically in the context of bacterial 
pneumonia. Consistent with this, we observed that hepcidin induction was dependent on IL-6, similar to 
observations with other systemic inflammatory stimuli (43). In addition, we found that IL-6 neutralization 
disrupted host defense against K. pneumoniae (Figure 3A), in corroboration with previous reports (22). 
While IL-6 induces many acute phase reactants, such as C reactive protein, which are crucial to the innate 
immune response, we speculate that hepcidin induction may be a component of IL-6–mediated protection.
These data provide the host counterpart to the existing literature on the role of the bacterial siderophore 
system in the virulence of Gram-negative pathogens (30, 44). The hypervirulent strain of K. pneumoniae used 
in this study produces yersiniabactin, which supports bacterial growth in the respiratory tract, and glycosylated 
enterobactin, which promotes bacterial growth in the bloodstream by evading lipocalin-2, a host-derived mole-
cule that sequesters nonglycosylated enterobactin and limits microbial iron uptake (45–49). Our findings indicate 
that even bacteria equipped with these high-affinity acquisition systems are susceptible to a host mechanism that 
limits iron availability in the host environment. As such, we speculate that these findings may be broadly applica-
ble to infections caused by other phylogenetically related aerobic Gram-negative pathogens (50).
This work has several implications for future research. First, our results may have implications for the 
therapeutic use of hepcidin antagonists, which are currently under development for the treatment of anemia 
of inflammation. In this context, we posit that relieving the iron-restricted state could predispose some indi-
viduals to Gram-negative sepsis. Second, impaired hepcidin production is a feature of several common clini-
cal entities, including alcohol intoxication and chronic liver disease (33–36), illnesses associated with striking 
susceptibility to Gram-negative bacteremia (51, 52). Our data suggest that impaired hepcidin production 
may represent an unappreciated mechanism predisposing these hosts to infection. Finally, hepcidin agonists 
may represent a novel therapeutic strategy in illnesses where hepcidin production is diminished, such as liver 
disease and hereditary hemochromatosis, and possibly more broadly in acquired iron-overload states.

Animals and in vivo procedures. C57BL/6 mice, purchased from the Jackson Laboratories. Hepc1–/– mice 
generated on a C57BL/6 background (26) — acquired from the University of California, Los Angeles, Cal-
ifornia, USA — were bred at the University of Virginia under specific-pathogen–free conditions for a min-
imum of 2 generations, and offspring were used in the experiments. To minimize any effect of differing 
microbiota between groups of animals, all animals were bred and maintained in the same room in the vivar-
ium and used bedding from cages of breeders, and animals to be used in experiments were intermixed at 
weekly intervals. Age- and sex-matched male and female 6- to 12-week-old mice were used in experiments.

Standard rodent chow has artifactually high iron content that causes near-maximal expression of hep-
cidin at baseline in WT animals (43). To correct this, all animals were conditioned on a low-iron diet 
(2–4 ppm iron; Teklad diet TD.80396, Envigo) for 5–7 days prior to, and throughout the duration of, all 
experiments. In our pilot studies and published reports (43, 53), this protocol normalizes baseline hepcidin 
expression without inducing iron deficiency.
Experimental bacterial pneumonia was induced as previously described (15, 16), by intratracheal inoc-
ulation of 500–1,500 CFU of K. pneumoniae strain 43816 (American Type Culture Collection). In some 
experiments, 1,500 CFU of K. pneumoniae was delivered i.v. in 100 μl PBS. To induce transient hyperferre-
mia without iron overload, 900 μg of ferric ammonium citrate in 100 μl PBS was delivered i.p., using a pre-
viously characterized protocol (54, 55). In some experiments, mice were given 1 mg anti–IL-6 antibody or 
isotype control i.p. 3 hours prior to and 24 hours following infection (clones MP5-20F3 and HRPN1, BioX-
cell). In other experiments, 100 nmol of the synthetic hepcidin analogue PR73 (manufactured in house), 
referred to as minihepcidin in text, or vehicle was administered via i.p. injection beginning 5 hours prior to 
infection and then every 24 hours until day 5 after infection. PR73 was synthesized using Fmoc solid-phase 
peptide synthesis and was solubilized for in vivo use with SL220 (a polyethylene glycosylated-phospholipid 
based solubilzer; NOF America Corporation) as previously described (11, 37, 38).
Tissue harvest and determination of  bacterial burden. Animals were euthanized with an overdose of a ket-
amine/xylazine solution, blood was collected from the right ventricle into heparinized syringes, and pul-
monary vasculature was perfused with 2 ml of 2 mM EDTA solubilized in PBS. The median liver lobe 
was collected for RNA analysis. Lungs and liver were homogenized in 1 ml PBS. BAL was performed by 
serially inflating the lungs via an intratracheal catheter with 1 ml of 2 mM EDTA solubilized in PBS and 
recovering the fluid 4 times (56). For bacterial enumeration, lung homogenates and blood were serially 
diluted in sterile water and cultured on blood agar plates, as previously described (57).
RNA, protein, and iron analysis. Tissue RNA was extracted using TRIzol and chloroform (Thermo-Fisher 
Scientific). Buffy coat RNA was extracted using a commercial kit (Qiagen). A commercial kit was used to 
synthesize cDNA (Promega). Hepcidin transcript was quantified by quantitative PCR in duplicate using SYBR 
green (Bioline). Expression was calculated using the ΔΔC(t) method normalized to glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate 
dehydrogenase, and then relative to hepcidin expression of uninfected animals. Primers were custom synthe-
sized (Sigma Aldrich) as previously published (35): hepcidin 5′ TGCAGAAGAGAAGGAAGAGAGACA 3′ 
(forward) and 5′ CACACTGGGAATTGTTACAGCATT 3′ (reverse); glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydroge-
nase 5′ TTCACCACCATGGAGAAGGC 3′ (forward) and 5′ GGCATGGACTGTGGTCATGA 3′ (reverse) 
(58). The thermal cycling conditions were as follows: 2 minutes at 95°C, 10 minutes at 95°C, 5 seconds at 95°C, 
and 10 seconds at 55°C for 40 cycles. Reactions were performed on a BioRad iQ5 Cycler. Protein concentration 
of hepcidin was quantified using a commercial ELISA kit (Intrinsic Life Sciences) according to the manu-
facturer instructions. Plasma iron was quantified with a commercial kit (Sekisui Diagnostics) according to 
manufacturer instructions with minor modifications — namely, samples were scaled to volume and centrifuged 
at 10,000 g for 10 minutes between steps to clear insoluble material. Transferrin saturation was determined 
by measuring the unsaturated iron binding capacity (UIBC) of each sample using a commercial kit (Sekisui 
Diagnostics). UIBC values were added to plasma iron values in each sample to calculate the total iron binding 
capacity (TIBC). Transferrin saturation was calculated as (plasma iron/TIBC) × 100%.
Tissue heme and nonheme iron levels were quantified using the ferrozine assay, as previously described 
(59–61). Whole lungs and left lateral lobe of the liver were homogenized in 1 ml of water. BAL was col-
lected into 1 ml of 2 mM EDTA solubilized in PBS. Briefly, 100 μl sample were heated in 100 μl buffer 
containing 1 N hydrochloric acid and 10% trichloroacetic acid with (total iron) or without (nonheme iron) 
2.25% KMnO4 at 60°C for 2 hours. Samples were centrifuged at 16,000 g for 10 minutes to remove insoluble 
material and were incubated with 50 μl iron detection reagent (6.5 mM ferrozine, 6.5 mM neucoproine, 1 M 
L-ascorbic acid, 2.5 M ammonium acetate) for 10 minutes and then plated in duplicate and read at A590 nm 
on a Dynex Triad microplate reader (Dynex Technologies). Heme-iron values were calculated by subtracting 
nonheme iron values from total iron content. Labile plasma iron (LPI), the major component of non–trans-
ferrin-bound iron, was measured using a published protocol with minor modifications (62): briefly, HEPES 
buffered saline was iron-depleted by incubation with Chelex-100 chelating resin (Bio-Rad) for 1 hour, fil-
tered, and supplemented with 60 nM deferrioxamine (Sigma-Aldrich). For LPI measurements, 10 μl of 
plasma samples were mixed with either 140 μl of HBS/50 μM dihydrorhodamine/40 μM ascorbic acid/0.5 
mM nitriloacetic acid (–DFP) or 140 μl of the same buffer supplemented with 100 μM deferriprone (+DFP).

Changes in fluorescence were measured over 40 minutes, and the slope was calculated for each sample. The 
difference between –DFP and +DFP was used as a measure of LPI. The experiment was repeated a total of 
3 times using different plasma donors with similar results.
Flow cytometry. Cell suspensions from blood and BAL fluid were prepared and analyzed by flow cytom-
etry as previously described, with minor modifications (16, 63, 64). The following antibodies were used 
for surface antigen staining: anti–MHC-II APC (clone M5/114.15.2), anti–CD11b Pe-Cy7 (clone M170), 
and anti–CD115 APC (clone AF598) from eBioscience; anti–CD11c PerCP (clone HL3) and anti–CD64 
brilliant violet 421 (clone X54-5/7.1) from BioLegend; and anti-CD16/CD32 (clone 2.4G2), anti–Ly6G 
PE (clone 1A8), and anti–CD45 AmCyan (clone 30-F11) from BD Biosciences. After extracellular staining, 
cells were washed in 1% FCS in PBS once and resuspended in the same buffer. Data were acquired on a 
FACS Canto II instrument using BD FACS Diva software (version 8.0; BD Biosciences) and analyzed with 
FlowJo software (version 8.8.6; Tree Star Inc.). The absolute cell number was calculated as the product of 
the cell type frequency (as determined by gating analysis) and the total number of cells in the sample (as 
determined by manually counting under a hemocytometer).
In vitro experiments. BM neutrophils were isolated by grinding the tibia, femur, pelvis, and spine from 
uninfected mice in a sterile mortar and pestle as previously described (15, 57), followed by positive selection 
using anti-Ly6G magnetic beads, according to the manufacturer’s instructions (MACS; Miltenyi Biotec). 
Isolated populations were found to have > 90% viability by examination in trypan blue. Neutrophil bacte-
rial killing was quantified using a published protocol with minor modifications (57). Briefly, K. pneumoniae 
was opsonized at a concentration of 8 × 106 CFU/ml in 20% fresh mouse serum and HBSS for 30 minutes 
at 37°C, washed once in cold water, once in HBSS, and resuspended in HBSS. Aliquots of 2 × 105 bacteria 
were added to sterile U-bottom 96-well plates and coincubated with 5 × 105, 2 × 105, 2 × 104, 2 × 103, or 
no neutrophils from WT or hepcidin-deficient mice in triplicate in a total volume of 200 μl HBSS. Samples 
were incubated in a humidified chamber with 5% CO2 at 37°C for 1 hour. Number of surviving bacteria 
was determined by hypotonic lysis of neutrophils in cold water and serial dilution and culture.
Human plasma was inactivated (30 min at 56°C) and incubated overnight at 37°C with 0–60 μM ferric 
ammonium citrate (Sigma-Aldrich), followed by quantification of transferrin saturation and LPI. The sam-
ples were then used to generate 90% plasma agar solid media, poured in sterile 12-well tissue culture plates. 
K. pneumoniae was suspended at 1 × 104 CFU/ml and 5 μl plated in triplicates on plasma agar wells and 
incubated for 24 hours at 37°C; bacterial colonies were counted and photographed.
Statistics. Data were analyzed using Prism software (version 6.0, GraphPad Software). The Mantel-Cox 
test was used to analyze survival data. A one-way ANOVA with a post-test for linear trend was used to 
analyze change in a single parameter over time, and one-way ANOVA with a Tukey multiple comparison 
post-test was used to analyze differences between 3 or more groups. A 2-way ANOVA with Tukey multiple 
comparison post-test was used to compare changes over time between 2 groups. An unpaired, 2-tailed t 
test was used to compare 2 groups for RNA, protein, and iron levels. A Mann-Whitney U test was used to 
compare bacterial burden between groups. P <0.05 was considered statistically significant.
Study approval. Animal experiments were performed in compliance with NIH Guide for the Care and 
Use of Laboratory Animals, The US Animal Welfare Act, and PHS Policy on Humane Care and Use of 
Laboratory Animals and was approved by the Institutional Animals Care and Use Committee at the Uni-
versity of Virginia (protocol 3571).
