Abstract
Fibrosis is a common pathology in cardiovascular disease1. In the heart, fibrosis causes 
mechanical and electrical dysfunction1,2 and in the kidney, it predicts the onset of renal failure3. 
Transforming growth factor β1 (TGFβ1) is the principal pro-fibrotic factor4,5, but its inhibition is 
associated with side effects due to its pleiotropic roles6,7. We hypothesized that downstream 
effectors of TGFβ1 in fibroblasts could be attractive therapeutic targets and lack upstream toxicity. 
Here we show, using integrated imaging–genomics analyses of primary human fibroblasts, that 
upregulation of interleukin-11 (IL-11) is the dominant transcriptional response to TGFβ1 exposure 
and required for its pro-fibrotic effect. IL-11 and its receptor (IL11RA) are expressed specifically 
in fibroblasts, in which they drive non-canonical, ERK-dependent autocrine signalling that is 
required for fibrogenic protein synthesis. In mice, fibroblast-specific Il11 transgene expression or 
Il-11 injection causes heart and kidney fibrosis and organ failure, whereas genetic deletion of 
Il11ra1 protects against disease. Therefore, inhibition of IL-11 prevents fibroblast activation across 
organs and species in response to a range of important pro-fibrotic stimuli. These results reveal a 
central role of IL-11 in fibrosis and we propose that inhibition of IL-11 is a potential therapeutic 
strategy to treat fibrotic diseases.
Trans-differentiation of fibroblasts into activated myofibroblasts, which express α-smooth 
muscle actin (ACTA2) and secrete extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins, is a defining feature 
of fibrosis8. We automated the quantification of myofibroblasts and ECM production in 
primary human cardiac fibroblast cultures (n = 84; Extended Data Table 1 and 
Supplementary Table 1), and performed RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) on paired unstimulated 
and TGFβ1-stimulated samples (Extended Data Fig. 1). Genes were ranked on the basis of 
the magnitude and significance of their differential expression and their correlation with 
myofibroblasts. Typical fibrosis genes such as COMP and NOX49 were among the most-
upregulated genes (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Table 2). Gene set enrichment analysis 
showed upregulation of genes important for protein secretion (Supplementary Table 3).

 Notably, IL11 expression showed the most positive correlation with myofibroblast numbers 
(r = 0.47, Padjusted = 6.44 × 10−6; Spearman’s correlation) (Fig. 1a) and upregulation of IL11 
expression (8.5-fold, Padjusted = 6 × 10−218; DESeq210) defined the dominant transcriptional 
response of cardiac fibroblasts to TGFβ1. IL11 expression is highly specific to fibroblasts, 
especially when stimulated, but is undetectable in most healthy human tissues and cells11,12 
(Extended Data Fig. 2). To further explore the biological context of IL-11, we examined the 
expression of its receptor (IL11RA) compared to the receptor of IL-6 (IL6R), a close family 
member, across 512 cell lines12. IL6R was present at high levels in immune cells, whereas 
IL11RA was most highly expressed in fibroblasts (Fig. 1b).
To investigate Il11 expression in vivo, we performed single-cell RNA-seq of hearts from a 
PlnR9C/+ mouse, which has a cardiac fibrosis phenotype13, and a wild-type control mouse 
(Fig. 1c and Extended Data Fig. 3). Both Il11 (P = 5.6 × 10−8) and Il11ra1 (P = 2.2 × 10−16) 
were enriched in fibroblasts and Il11 was highly expressed in fibroblast subpopulations that 
had transcriptional features of TGFβ1 activation or ECM production (Fig. 1d). Il11-
expressing cells were most common in fibrotic PlnR9C/+ hearts and we confirmed Il-11 
protein upregulation in this model (Extended Data Fig. 3).
IL11 has been linked to haematopoiesis14 and tumorigenesis15, among other roles. In 
contrast to a previous cardiac study16, we found that recombinant human IL-11 (rhIL-11) is 
strongly pro-fibrotic in cardiac fibroblasts, increasing myofibroblasts and ECM production, 
motility, contraction and invasion (Fig. 1e and Extended Data Fig. 4). To better understand 
the apparent contradiction between our data and the previous work in which rhIL-11 was 
used in mouse models16, we tested whether rhIL-11 could activate mouse cardiac 
fibroblasts. rhIL-11 was mostly ineffective in mouse cardiac fibroblasts, whereas 
recombinant mouse Il-11 (rmIl-11) activated mouse cardiac and renal fibroblasts (Extended 
Data Fig. 4). rhIL-11 strongly activated human renal fibroblasts.
Our findings implicate a pro-fibrotic role for IL-11 downstream of TGFβ1. In the presence 
of neutralizing anti-IL-11 antibodies, the pro-fibrotic effects of TGFβ1 were greatly 
diminished across a wide range of fibrosis assays (Fig. 1f–i and Extended Data Fig. 4). We 
made ligand traps by fusing IL11RA and gp130 (IL11RA:gp130) and these traps inhibited 
the pro-fibrotic effects of TGFβ1 in a dose- dependent manner. The specificity of IL-11 
inhibition was further confirmed through inhibition of IL11RA using receptor-blocking 
antibodies or by short interfering RNA (siRNA), all of which attenuated the effects of 
TGFβ1. By contrast, anti-IL-6 antibodies had no effect on TGFβ1- induced cardiac 
fibroblast activation (Extended Data Fig. 4).
We next investigated the consequences of IL-11 signalling in cardiac fibroblasts using RNA-
seq. Surprisingly, the effect of IL-11 on the transcriptome was negligible, whereas TGFβ1-
driven transcriptional regulation in cardiac fibroblasts from the same patients remained 
profound (Fig. 2a, b). We repeated the experiment using cardiac fibroblasts from multiple 
patients and consistently observed very little effect of IL-11 on mRNA levels but, in the cell 
culture supernatants of identical samples, we reproducibly documented pro-fibrotic protein 
secretion. Therefore, the effects of IL-11 on cardiac fibroblasts are mainly at the protein

 level and are unrelated to transcriptional changes (Extended Data Fig. 5). This differs from 
effects of IL-11 on cancer cells, in which JAK–STAT signalling is involved17.
IL-11 can bind to free IL11RA, which is shed from cardiac fibroblast membranes (Extended 
Data Fig. 5) and signal in trans in cells that express GP130 (also known as IL6STP1)18. We 
generated an IL11RA:IL-11 fusion protein (hyperIL-11), which mimics the transsignalling 
complex19. Concentrations of hyperIL-11 as low as 0.2 ng ml−1 activated cardiac fibroblasts 
(Extended Data Fig. 5), supporting a role for IL-11 trans-signalling in fibrosis.
We found that both IL11 and IL11RA are expressed in fibroblasts, which implies that an 
autocrine signalling loop exists. Using hyperIL-11, which is not detected in an IL-11 
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), we confirmed the existence of autocrine 
IL-11 signalling in cardiac fibroblasts. This autocrine, feed-forward loop of hyperIL-11-
induced IL-11 secretion is dependent on de novo IL-11 protein synthesis and secretion (Fig. 
2c and Extended Data Fig. 5), but is independent of IL11 RNA levels. In separate 
experiments, rhIL-11 (not detected by IL-11 ELISA) cis-signalling also strongly induced 
endogenous IL-11 secretion, and this also occurred in the absence of changes in IL11 
mRNA levels (Extended Data Fig. 5).
TGFβ1 activation of non-canonical ERK signalling in fibroblasts is important for fibrosis4,5 
and we observed that IL-11 also activated ERK in cardiac fibroblasts and that both TGFβ1 
and IL-11 required ERK to induce pro-fibrotic phenotypes (Fig. 2d and Extended Data Fig. 
5). Because the effects of IL-11 on pro-fibrotic gene expression are post-transcriptional, we 
suggest that this phenomenon may be driven, in part, by activation of ERK and its 
downstream substrates (Extended Data Fig. 5).
We therefore investigated the activation of STAT, SMAD, ERK and kinases that are 
important for protein synthesis in cardiac fibroblasts in response to stimulation by a range of 
pro-fibrotic factors. These factors included established stimuli for cardiac fibrosis 
(endothelin-1 (END1), angiotensin II (AngII) and PDGF) and other key pro-fibrotic 
cytokines (OSM, bFGF, CTGF and IL13)1,5. IL-11 activation of STAT in cardiac fibroblasts 
was negligible, consistent with its lack of transcriptional effects in this cell type. As 
expected, TGFβ1 activated SMAD, but the only pathway that was consistently activated by 
all stimuli was the ERK pathway (Fig. 2e). All pro-fibrotic stimuli that were tested induced 
changes in IL-11 protein levels but not mRNA; only TGFβ1 increased SMAD-dependent 
IL11 transcription (Fig. 2f and Extended Data Fig. 5). Remarkably, as seen with TGFβ1, 
fibroblast activation in response to all pro-fibrotic stimuli that were tested was dependent on 
IL-11 signalling (Fig. 2g and Extended Data Fig. 6).
We studied the fibrotic response of cardiac fibroblasts from Il11ra1−/− mice20. TGFβ1-
induced transcriptional regulation in Il11ra1−/− cardiac fibroblasts was maintained and 
similar to that of Il11ra1+/+ (wild-type) cardiac fibroblasts (R2 = 0.94, P < 2.2 × 10−16, 
Spearman’s correlation; Extended Data Fig. 7). However, protein-based assays showed that 
cardiac fibroblasts from Il11ra1−/− mice did not increase synthesis of ECM proteins or 
become myofibroblasts upon stimulation (Fig. 2h and Extended Data Fig. 7), again 
demonstrating the effect of IL-11 at the protein level.

 We investigated the role of Il-11 in a mouse model of myocardial infarction, but rather than 
injecting rhIL-11, as had been done in the previous study16, we administered rmIl-11. We 
measured epicardial activation, a defining feature of active fibrosis in myocardial 
infarction21 and found that rmIl-11 robustly stimulated fibroblasts in the epicardium (Fig. 
3a–c) and caused ventricular impairment (Fig. 3d, e). We then tested the effects of rmIl-11 
injection in healthy mice using regimens similar to those used for rhIL-11 in patients with 
cancer22. rmIL-11 injection in Col1a1–GFP reporter mice23 resulted in specific activation of 
fibroblasts in the epicardium and renal interstitium (Fig. 3f). rmIl-11-treated mice had high 
circulating levels of TGFβ1, but not of other pro-inflammatory factors and features of 
cardiac and renal impairment along with cardiovascular fibrosis (Fig. 3g–i and Extended 
Data Fig. 7).
To investigate the effects of autocrine Il-11 signalling in fibroblasts in vivo, we generated 
rmIl-11-transgenic mice, which we crossed with inducible Col1a2–Cre mice (Il-11-Tg; see 
Methods). Il-11 was expressed after induction with tamoxifen and within two weeks, there 
was widespread activation of cardiac and renal fibroblasts and accumulation of collagen 
(Fig. 3j, k). This was accompanied by a reduction in cardiac function (Fig. 3l), increased 
serum TGFβ1 and an increase in serum urea and creatinine, which are biomarkers of renal 
failure (Extended Data Fig. 7).
Il-11 expression was found to be increased in three preclinical models of cardiovascular 
fibrosis (Fig. 4a, e, i). Therefore, using knockout and wild-type mice we determined whether 
inhibition of Il-11 could reduce fibrosis in these models. After either AngII infusion or 
transverse aortic constriction, less fibrosis occurred in the hearts of knockout mice compared 
to wild-type mice (Fig. 4b, c, f, g). This effect was independent of loading conditions 
(Extended Data Fig. 8). Similarly, after folateinduced kidney damage, knockout mice had 
reduced renal fibrosis (Fig. 4j, k). Deletion of Il11ra1 signalling resulted in reduced ERK 
signalling across all models tested, whereas p38 signalling was unaffected (Fig. 4d, h, l and 
Extended Data Fig. 9).
IL-11 was discovered owing to its ability to sustain an IL-6-dependent haematopoetic cell 
line when secreted from fibroblastic cells24, but was later found to be redundant for 
haematopoiesis20. Here we show that IL11 is a crucial fibrosis gene acting downstream of 
TGFβ1 and many other pro-fibrotic factors. We believe that the importance of IL-11 in 
fibroblasts may have gone unnoticed because its effects are apparent only at the post-
transcriptional level (Extended Data Fig. 9). We highlight that IL11RA is not only expressed 
in fibroblasts but also in other cells and that IL-11 signalling may therefore be important in 
other cell types.
We note that rhIL-11 has been given to patients with myocardial infarction25 and it is 
possible that the use of rhIL-11 in cancer patients22 causes fibrosis-related side effects. We 
therefore suggest that the use of rhIL-11 in humans should be reviewed. IL11 is highly 
upregulated in fibroblasts from patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis or systemic 
sclerosis, by a 100-fold and 30-fold, respectively26; this suggests a role for IL-11 in fibrotic 
human disease beyond the cardiovascular system. IL-11 inhibitors may be particularly 
effective in treating fibrosis, because they would target a nodal point of pro-fibrotic

 signalling. Because of these results, and target safety data from human27 and mouse 
knockouts20, we propose that IL-11 is a potential therapeutic target.

METHODS
Data reporting
No statistical methods were used to predetermine sample size. The experiments were not 
randomized.
Patient cohort
Patients (n = 84, aged between ≥ 21 and ≤ 81) undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting 
(CABG) at the National Heart Centre Singapore were recruited to the study, which was 
approved by the SingHealth Centralised Institutional Review Board (CIRB; 2013/103/C). 
Patients with valvular heart disease or previous atrial intervention were excluded. Atrial 
biopsies (94.6 ± 59.5 mg) were collected from the right atrium and were used to grow 
primary atrial fibroblasts. A summary of patient data is provided in Extended Data Table 1 
and detailed patient data are presented in Supplementary Table 1.
Recombinant proteins
Commercial recombinant proteins—Human CTGF (PHG0286, Biosource), human 
endothelin 1 (1160/100U, Tocris), human bFGF (233-FB-025, R&D Systems), human IL-11 
(PHC0115, Life Technologies), human IL-13 (PHC0134, Biosource), human oncostatin M 
(PHC5015, Biosource), human PDGF (220-BB-010, R&D Systems), human angiotensin II 
(A9525, Sigma-Aldrich), and human TGFβ1 (PHP143B, Bio-Rad).
Custom recombinant proteins—Recombinant mouse IL-11 (UniProtKB: P47873) and 
human IL-11 (UniProtKB: P20809) were synthesized without the signal peptide. 
HyperIL-11 was constructed using a fragment of IL11RA (amino acid residues 1–317 
consisting of domains 1–3; UniProtKB: Q14626) and IL-11 (amino acid residues 22–199, 
UniProtKB: P20809) with a 20-amino-acid-long linker: GPAGQSGGGGGSGGGSGGGSV. 
Decoy receptors were constructed using a fragment of gp130 (amino acid residues 1–326 
consisting of domains 1–3, UniProtKB: P40189) and IL11RA (amino acid residues 109–308 
consisting of domains 2–3, UniProtKB: Q14626) with either a 33-amino-acid-long linker: 
GGGGSTRGSAGSGGSATGSGSAAGSGDSVRRGS or a 50-amino-acid-long linker: 
GGGGSTRGQLHTQPEVEPQVDSPAPPRPSLQPHPRLLDHRDSVEQVAVG. All custom 
recombinant proteins were synthesized by GenScript using a mammalian expression system.
Primary fibroblast culture
Human cardiac fibroblasts were prepared as follows: right atrial biopsies were weighed, 
minced into 1–2 mm3 pieces, and placed in 6-cm dishes. Human cardiac fibroblasts were 
grown and maintained in DMEM (11995- 065, Gibco) supplemented with 20% fetal bovine

 serum (FBS, 10500, Hyclone) and 1% penicillin–streptomycin (15140-122, Gibco), in a 
humidified atmosphere at 37 °C and 5% CO2. The medium was renewed every 2–3 days. At 
80–90% confluence, cells were passaged using standard trypsinization techniques. This 
protocol was also used to isolate fibroblasts from mouse atria, ventricles and kidneys. 
Human primary kidney fibroblasts (H-6016; CellBiologics) were cultured in specific 
medium (M2267, CellBiologics). All experiments were carried out at low cell passage (< 
P4) and cells were cultured in serum-free media for 16 h before treatment.
Antibodies and inhibitors used in this study were as follows: IgG type 2a (MAB003, R&D 
Systems), anti-IL-11 antibody (MAB218, R&D Systems), anti- IL11RA antibody 
(MAB1977, R&D Systems), brefeldin A (B7651, Sigma-Aldrich), cycloheximide (C1988, 
Sigma-Aldrich), PD98059 (9900, Cell Signaling), and U0126 (9930, Cell Signaling).
Operetta platform and image analysis
Fibroblasts were seeded in 96-well black CellCarrier plates (6005550, Perkin-Elmer) at a 
density of 1 × 104 cells per well. Following experimental conditions, cells were rinsed in 
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA, 28908, Life 
Technologies). Cells were permeabilized with 0.1%Triton X-100 in PBS. EdU–
AlexaFluor488 was incorporated using a Click-iT EdU labelling kit (C10350, Life 
Technologies) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Non-specific sites were blocked 
using blocking solution (0.5% BSA and 0.1% Tween-20 in PBS). Cells were incubated 
overnight at 4 °C with antibodies: α-smooth muscle actin (ACTA2, ab7817, Abcam), 
collagen I (ab292, Abcam), periostin (POSTN; ab14041, Abcam). All primary antibodies 
were diluted 1:500 in blocking solution. Following wash buffer (0.25% BSA and 0.1% 
Tween-20 in PBS) rinses, cells were incubated with the appropriate AlexaFluor488- 
conjugated secondary antibodies (1:1,000) for 1 h at room temperature in the dark. Cells 
were counter-stained with rhodamine–phalloidin (1:1,000, R415, Life Technologies) and 
DAPI (1 μg ml−1, D1306, Life Technologies) in blocking solution. Plates were scanned and 
images were collected with an Operetta high-content imaging system 1483 (PerkinElmer). 
Each condition was assayed from at least three wells and a minimum of seven fields per 
well. The quantification of ACTA2+ and EdU+ cells was done using Harmony software 
version 3.5.2 (PerkinElmer). The measurement of collagen I and POSTN fluorescence 
intensity per area was performed with Columbus version 2.7.1 (PerkinElmer).
Scratch wound and migration assay
Human cardiac fibroblast migration was determined using in vitro scratch wound assays and 
Boyden chamber assays in duplicate per patient sample. Scratch wound assays were 
performed on confluent monolayers of fibroblasts. After synchronizing in low serum 
medium (DMEM containing 0.2% FBS) for 24 h, a linear scratch was created with a sterile 
pipette tip and cells were subjected to different treatments for 24 h. Changes in the wound 
area were imaged at 0 and 24 h and quantified using ImageJ software (version 1.49). Boyden 
chamber assays were performed using a Cell Migration Assay kit (Cell Biolabs) as per the 
manufacturer’s protocol. Fibroblasts (5 × 104 cells per well) were seeded inside trans-well 
inserts, and could migrate towards the experimental conditions as in the wound assays for 24 
h.

 Collagen gel contraction assay
Collagen gel contraction assays were performed in duplicate per patient sample of cardiac 
fibroblasts (8 × 104 cells per well) using a Cell Contraction Assay kit (Cell Biolabs) as per 
the manufacturer’s protocol. The cells were treated with stimuli similar to the scratch wound 
assays, except that cells were cultured in DMEM containing 1% FBS. The gels were imaged 
every 24 h for 72 h and gel area was quantified using ImageJ software (version 1.49).
siRNA transfection
Human cardiac fibroblasts were seeded in 96-well black CellCarrier (PerkinElmer) plates (1 
× 104 cells per well) and transfected with 12.5 nM On-Targetplus siRNAs (Dharmacon) in 
serum-free Opti-MEM medium and DMEM containing 10% FBS (ratio 1:9) using 
Lipofectamine RNAiMax (13778-150, Life Technologies). The cells were transfected for 24 
h and subsequently cultured in DMEM containing 1%FBS overnight before subjected to 
different treatment conditions.
RNA-seq library preparation
Total RNA was isolated from human cardiac fibroblasts using RNeasy columns (Qiagen). 
RNA was quantified using a Qubit RNA High-Sensitivity Assay kit (Life Technologies) and 
assessed for degradation on the basis of their RNA integrity number using the Bioanalyzer 
RNA 6000 Nano assay (Agilent Technologies). TruSeq Stranded mRNA Library Prep kit 
(Illumina) was used to assess transcript abundance following standard instructions from the 
manufacturer. The final libraries were quantified using KAPA library quantification kits 
(KAPA Biosystems) on a StepOnePlus Real-Time PCR system (Applied Biosystems) 
according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The quality and average fragment size of the final 
libraries were determined using a LabChip GX DNA High Sensitivity Reagent Kit (Perkin 
Elmer). Libraries were pooled and sequenced on a HiSeq 2500 in High Output mode using 
75-bp paired-end sequencing chemistry.
RNA-seq analysis
RNA-seq data pre-processing—Raw sequencing data (.bcl files) were demultiplexed 
into FastQ files with Illumina’s bcl2fastq (version 1.8.4) based on unique index pairs. 
TopHat (version 2.0.12) was used for mapping the reads to the human genome 
(GRCh38.78), with the following parameters: number of threads, prefilter multihits, read 
mismatches, read edit distance, mate inner distance and read realign edit distance29. Gene 
level counts were computed using HTSeq30 (version 0.6.1) with the same human genome 
reference used for mapping (Ensembl version 78). Ribosomal genes (Ensembl gene biotype 
‘rRNA’) and genes located in chromosomes other than 1–22, X and Y were discarded.
Differential expression of stimulated versus non-stimulated fibroblasts—
Differential expression between the stimulated and non-stimulated samples was computed at 
the gene level from gene counts using the DESeq210 R package (version 1.10.1). A pre-
filtering step was used by considering only genes with counts above one across all samples 
(36,352 genes remained after this filter). To account for patient effects and technical 
artefacts, patient ID, sex and RNA concentration were added as covariates in the differential

 expression model. The baseline comparison was set to non-stimulation. DESeq2 
independentFiltering parameter was set to False. The rest of the parameters were left as 
default.
Functional enrichment of differential expression results
Gene Ontology (GO) functional enrichment of the differential expression results was 
performed with Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) software (version 2.2.2). Human 
Ensembl genes IDs included in DESeq210 output were mapped gene symbols by retrieving 
‘hgnc_symbol’ (using the biomaRt R package and Ensembl version 78). Genes without gene 
symbol were removed (the final number of genes was 21,412). Then all genes were ranked 
by the corresponding DESeq2 output Wald statistic (‘stat’ in DESeq2 output, defined as 
estimate of the log2 fold change divided by its standard error).
One functional GSEA run was performed for each GO category (BP, CC and MF) retrieved 
from the Molecular Signatures Database gene sets (version 5.2, gene sets queried using gene 
symbols)31. A total of three GSEA runs was carried out. GSEA was run in classic pre-rank 
mode with 10,000 permutations to assess the false discovery rate (FDR). In the GSEA runs, 
maximum cluster size was set to 5,000 and minimum cluster size was set to 10.
Computation of variation in gene expression
TPM were computed as follows. Gene read counts were divided by gene length in kilobases 
(gene length was computed using featureCounts software, version 1.5.1). This results in 
reads per kilobase (RPK). To obtain then TPM values, RPKs were divided by the sample 
‘per million’ scaling factor (defined as the total number of gene counts in a sample divided 
by a million). The removeBatchEffect function from the limma R package (version 3.26.9) 
was used to remove technical batch effects. In removeBatchEffect, the expression matrix 
was set to the log2(TPM + 1) expression matrix, the batch1 variable was set to ‘library 
preparation batch’ and the covariates variable was set to ‘RNA concentration’. The obtained 
matrix was split into non-stimulated and stimulated. Then the removeBatchEffect function 
was run a second time to remove patient sex and race effects separately. From this output 
data, the delta of each gene was computed.
Correlation between the delta of gene expression and delta ACTA2
ACTA2+ cells were measured in samples from the 84 patients as described above (Operetta 
image analysis). Outlier measurements were removed from the ACTA2+ cells 
measurements. To select the measurements to be removed, we plotted the distribution of the 
s.d. in the measurements of each patient (n = 3). We removed the most distant point in the 
top one percentile of patients with the highest s.d. This procedure was carried out in the 
TGFβ1-stimulated and non- stimulated measurement separately. For each patient sample, 
mean ACTA2 levels were computed in baseline and stimulated fibroblasts. The 
corresponding delta ACTA2 was derived (defined as the difference between the mean 
stimulated and the mean nonstimulated). Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient and the 
corresponding Student’s t-test P value were computed between the stimulated and non-
stimulated delta of each gene and the delta ACTA2 by using the function corAndPvalue 
from the WGCNA R package (version 1.51)32.

 RNA-seq analysis in the test cohort (patients, n = 9; mouse, n = 18)
Raw sequencing data (.bcl files) were demultiplexed into individual FastQ read files with 
Illumina’s bcl2fastq version 2.16.0.10 on the basis of unique index pairs. The adaptor 
sequences and low quality reads and/or bases were trimmed using Trimmomatic version 
0.3633 and the read quality was assessed using FastQC version 0.11.534. High-quality reads 
were mapped to Ensembl human GRCh38 version 86 reference or mouse GRCm38 version 
86 reference genomes using Spliced Transcripts Alignment to a Reference (STAR) version 
2.5.2b35.
STAR alignment options were selected on the basis of the parameters used in the ENCODE 
project. Strand-specific raw counts of uniquely mapped (paired-end) reads were summarized 
with featureCounts36 to get gene-level quantification of genomic features: featureCounts -t 
exon -g gene_id -s 2 –p. Differential expression was performed with DESeq210 version 
1.14.1 using raw read counts from featureCounts. We performed a minimal pre-filtering to 
remove genes that have no reads or only a single read across all samples to reduce the data 
size and speed up the analysis process.
Sample IDs were included as covariates in DESeq210 design formula to remove batch effect 
due to samples and increase the sensitivity for finding differences among the conditions. 
Basal condition was always used as the reference level for pair-wise comparisons. Shrinkage 
MA-plot was generated to show the log2 fold changes over the mean of normalized counts 
and points are coloured red if the adjusted P value was less than 0.1.
GTEx/Fantom analysis
Two independent analyses were carried to test the tissue specificity of the expression of 
IL-11. These analyses used tissue expression data from the Genotype–Tissue Expression 
(GTEx)11 project and the primary cell expression data from FANTOM512. The test was 
designed to find those genes which had an expression profile that most closely matched an 
‘idealized’ expression profile in which a gene is only expressed in stimulated fibroblasts. To 
do this, we used the Jennson–Shannon divergence (JSD) index, which is a measure of 
similarity between two probability distributions. We compared each distribution from 
FANTOM or GTEx incorporating our own expression data on stimulated fibroblasts to the 
idealized distribution. As a result, all genes with a low distance (according to JSD) to this 
idealized distribution are genes that are specific to stimulated fibroblasts and as such 
represent good candidates for further investigation.
GTEx data processing
GTEx11 project RNA-seq V6p gene read counts (file GTEx_Analysis_v6p_RNA-seq_RNA-
SeQCv1.1.8_gene_reads.gct.gz), reference annotation file 
(gencode.v19.genes.v6p_model.patched_contigs.gtf.gz GTEx V6p) and sample attributes 
(file GTEx_Data_V6_Annotations_SampleAttributesDS.txt) were downloaded from https://
www.gtexportal.org/home/. TPM were computed as stated above using the downloaded gene 
reference annotation file. All samples provided by GTEx were used (n = 8,555), classified 
by tissue type as included in the column ‘SMTS’ of the sample attributes file, 30 tissues in 
total. Our gene TPM dataset consisting of 84 samples with unstimulated and TGFβ1-

 stimulated fibroblasts was added (n = 168) to this GTEx data and all samples were quantile-
normalized.
FANTOM data processing
Expression levels of all genes in primary cell types with replicates were downloaded from 
the FANTOM5 web resource (119 cell types). Because the FANTOM5 data are at the level 
of transcription start site expression derived from CAGE sequencing, we calculated the gene 
level expression by summing all counts that were assigned to a given gene. These were then 
normalized by library size in order to calculate the TPM for each gene. We then incorporated 
the TPM values from the stimulated fibroblasts and quantile normalized the data to ensure 
that data from the different techniques were comparable. In order to compare the expression 
profiles of IL11RA and IL6R, we extracted the TPM for these two genes across 511 
different primary cell samples that covered cell types from all lineages. In each case, for 
which the expression of either IL11RA or IL6R is above the level of noise, we highlight 
these cell types and categorize them as described in the FANTOM5 cell type ontology.
JSD computation
On the basis of the distribution of the TPM gene expression levels in the 168 fibroblasts 
samples before quantile normalization, genes with average log2(TPM + 1) higher than 2 
were selected (Extended Data Fig. 2). In addition, only protein-coding genes were 
considered. The final number of genes included in the GTEx + fibroblasts and FANTOM + 
fibroblast analysis was 10,736 and 9,888, respectively.
The JSD was computed between the probability distribution of each gene and an idealized 
distribution, representing the situation in which a gene is only expressed in stimulated 
fibroblasts. The probability distribution of each gene was computed as the median gene 
expression in each condition, that is, GTEx tissue, FANTOM cell type or unstimulated or 
stimulated fibroblast, divided by the sum of the median gene expression across all 
conditions. The idealized probability distribution was defined as probability of 1 × 10−20 in 
all conditions, except for stimulated fibroblasts (with probability ~ 1). JSD was computed 
using the R package jsd (version 0.1).
Single-cell RNA-seq
Single-cell suspensions of non-cardiomyocytes were derived from adult left ventricles as 
previously described37 either from male, 18-week-old transgenic mice13 overexpressing 
PLNR9C/+ or from FVB littermates. Single cells were isolated, lysed and subsequently RNA 
was reverse-transcribed and converted into cDNA libraries for RNA-seq analysis using a 
Chromium Controller and a Chromium Single Cell 3′ v2 Reagent kit (Genomics 10×) 
following the manufacturer’s protocol. Libraries derived from PLNR9C/+ or FVB mice were 
pooled together for DNA sequencing on a NextSeq 500 (Illumina) using a high-output kit 
(150 cycles) to a mean depth of > 60,000 reads per cell. Alignment of reads to the genome 
and generation of gene counts per cell was performed by Cell Ranger 1.2 software 
(Genomics 10×). Cells of sufficient complexity were clustered using tSNE and plots were 
generated using the Seurat R package28.

 Mouse models
Animal procedures were approved and conducted in accordance with the SingHealth 
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) or in accordance with local 
guidelines from collaborating laboratories. All mice were from a C57BL/6 genetic 
background and they were bred and housed in the same room and provided food and water 
ad libitum. For in vivo gain-of-function studies, the mice were allocated to experimental 
groups to ensure equal litter/sex/age across groups. Randomization was not applicable to 
loss-of-function animal studies owing to genotype-dependent analyses. For gain-of-function 
in vivo studies, treatment was not disclosed to investigators generating quantitative readouts 
after treatment. For loss-of-function studies, genotypes were not disclosed to investigators 
treating the animals, or generating quantitative readouts.
Il11ra1 knockout mice
Mice lacking functional alleles for Il11ra1 (Il11ra1−/−, KO) and their wild-type littermates 
Il11ra1+/+ were 10–12 weeks of age and the weights of mice did not differ significantly. 
Il11ra1+/+ and Il11ra1−/− male mice were subcutaneously (s.c.) implanted with an osmotic 
minipump (Alzet model 1004, Durect) containing either angiotensin II (AngII, 2 mg kg−1 
per day) in saline (0.9% w/v) to stimulate cardiac fibrosis or an identical volume of saline. 
Mice were post-operatively treated with enrofloxacin (15 mg kg−1, s.c.) and buprenorphine 
(0.1 mg kg−1, s.c.) for three consecutive days. Kidney fibrosis was induced by 
intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of folic acid (180 mg kg−1) in vehicle (0.3 M NaHCO3) into 
Il11ra1+/+ and Il11ra1−/− female mice; control mice were administered vehicle alone. Mice 
were euthanized 28 days post-implantation or post-injection, respectively. TAC was 
performed in Il11ra1+/+ and Il11ra1−/− male mice as described previously38. Post-operative 
treatment was performed as described above. Age-matched sham mice underwent a sham 
operative procedure without TAC. Trans-thoracic two-dimensional Doppler 
echocardiography was used to confirm increased pressure gradients (> 40 mm Hg) indicative 
of successful TAC. Mice were euthanized at 2 weeks post-TAC for histological and 
molecular assessments.
Il-11 transgenic (Il-11-Tg) model
In this model, the mouse Il11 cDNA was expressed under the control of the ubiquitous 
cytomegalovirus immediate early enhancer and the chicken β-actin promoter. A loxP-
flanked STOP cassette was introduced in between the promoter and the transgene so that 
overexpression could be conditionally induced by Cre recombinase. The conditional 
transgene was introduced into the Rosa26 gene locus of embryonic stem cells and this 
transgenic mouse line is referred to here as Rosa26-Il11 mice.
To direct transgene expression in fibroblasts, heterozygous Rosa26-Il11 mice were crossed 
with Col1a2-CreER mice39 to create double heterozygous Col1a2- CreER:Rosa26-Il11 
progenies (referred to here as Il-11-Tg mice). Il-11-Tg mice were injected with 1mg 
tamoxifen (T5648, Sigma-Aldrich) i.p. at 6 weeks of age for 10 consecutive days to induce 
Cre-mediated recombination. Likewise, wild-type littermates were injected with 1 mg 
tamoxifen for 10 consecutive days as controls.

 The mice were euthanized 14 days after cessation of tamoxifen administration.
In vivo Il-11 administration model
rmIl-11 was reconstituted to a concentration of 50 μg ml−1 in saline. Ten-week-old male 
mice and transgenic Col1a1-GFP reporter mice23 were subjected to daily s.c. injection with 
either 100 μg kg−1 of rmIl-11 or an identical volume of saline for 21 days.
Myocardial infarction model
Wild-type male mice (10–12 weeks) underwent myocardial infarction surgery as described 
previously40. Age-matched controls underwent sham procedures without ligation of the 
coronary artery. In a subset of myocardial infarction mice, rmIl-11 or an identical volume of 
PBS were administered daily via s.c. injection for 6 successive days.
Echocardiography
Trans-thoracic echocardiography was performed on all mice using Vevo 2100 with a MS400 
linear array transducer (VisualSonics), 18–38 MHz. Mice were anaesthetized with 2% 
isoflurane and kept warm on a heated platform (37 °C). The chest hairs were removed using 
depilatory cream and a layer of acoustic coupling gel was applied to the thorax. An average 
of 10 cardiac cycles of standard 2D and m-mode short axis at mid papillary muscle level 
according to a previously described method were obtained and stored for subsequent offline 
analysis41. Left ventricular ejection fraction and dimensions were calculated using a 
modified Quinone method42.
In vivo telemetry
Before TA11PA-C10 blood pressure device (Data Sciences International) implantation, the 
zero offset was measured, and the unit was soaked in 0.9% NaCl. Mice were anaesthetized 
with isoflurane and kept warm on a heated platform. The pressure-sensing catheter was 
inserted into the left carotid artery and extended into the aorta, and the transmitter was 
placed in a subcutaneous pocket. All mice were allowed 10 days recovery from surgery 
before baseline blood pressure values were recorded for five days. The data from the 
TA11PA-C10 device were transmitted via radio frequency signals to a receiver below the 
home cage and sampled every 5 min for 10 s continuously day and night with a sampling 
rate of 1,000 Hz. Following five days baseline pressure recording, the mice received AngII 
as described above. Telemetry data were collected continuously for the duration of the AngII 
infusion.
ELISA
The level of IL-11, IL11RA, MMP-2, and TIMP-1 in equal volumes of cell culture medium 
were quantified using the following kits: Human IL-11 Quantikine ELISA kit (D1100, R&D 
Systems), Human IL11RA ELISA kit (LSF8919, Lifespan Biosciences), Total MMP-2 
Quantikine ELISA kit (MMP200, R&D Systems), Human TIMP-1 Quantikine ELISA kit 
(DTM100, R&D Systems). Mouse plasma level of CRP, IFNγ, TGFβ1, and TNF were 
measured using the following kits: CRP Quantikine ELISA kit (ab157712, Abcam), and

 Mouse IFNγ ELISA kit (ab100689, Abcam), Mouse TNF ELISA kit (ab208348, Abcam), 
and Mouse TGFβ1 ELISA kit (ab119557, Abcam).
Colourimetric assays
Quantification of total secreted collagen in the cell culture supernatant was performed using 
a Sirius red collagen detection kit (9062, Chondrex). The mouse plasma levels of urea and 
creatinine were quantified using urea assay kit (ab83362, Abcam) and creatinine assay kit 
(ab65340, Abcam), respectively. The amount of total collagen in the heart and kidney was 
quantified on the basis of colourimetric detection of hydroxyproline using a Quickzyme 
Total Collagen assay kit (Quickzyme Biosciences). All colourimetric assays were performed 
according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
RT–qPCR
Total RNA was extracted from either the snap-frozen tissues or cell lysate using Trizol 
reagent (Invitrogen) followed by RNeasy column (Qiagen) purification. The cDNA was 
prepared using an iScript cDNA synthesis kit, in which each reaction contained 1 μg of total 
RNA, as per the manufacturer’s instructions. Quantitative RT–PCR gene expression analysis 
was performed on triplicate samples with either TaqMan (Applied Biosystems) or fast 
SYBR green (Qiagen) technology using a StepOnePlus (Applied Biosystem) over 40 cycles. 
Expression data were normalized to GAPDH mRNA expression levels and we used the 
2−ΔΔCt method to calculate the fold change. Specific TaqMan probes were obtained from 
Applied Biosystems and are available upon request.
Immunoblotting
Western blot analysis was carried out on total protein extracts from fibroblasts or mouse 
tissues. Fibroblasts or frozen tissues were homogenized by gentle rocking in lysis buffer 
(RIPA buffer containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors (Roche)) followed by 
centrifugation to clear the lysate. Equal amounts of protein lysates were separated by SDS–
PAGE, transferred to a PVDF membrane, and subjected to immunoblotting analysis of p-
AKT (4060, CST), AKT (4691, CST), p-EIF4E (9741, CST), EIF4E (2067, CST), p-
ERK1/2 (4370, CST), ERK1/2 (4695, CST), GAPDH (2118, CST), IL-11 (MAB218, R&D

and STAT3 (4904,CST). Proteins were visualized using the ECL detection system (Pierce) 
with the appropriate secondary antibodies: anti-rabbit HRP (7074, CST) and anti-mouse 
HRP (7076, CST). Each western blot experiment was repeated independently with similar 
results as follows: Fig. 2c HyperIL-11 + BFA, n = 3; Fig. 2e various pro-fibrotic stimuli, n =

 Histology
Tissues from TAC and Col1a1–GFP mice models were subjected to cryosectioning and 
tissues from all other models were paraffin-embedded. Hearts were sectioned at 5 μm and 
kidneys at 3 μm. For paraffin sections, tissues were fixed for 24 h, at room temperature in 
10% neutral-buffered formalin (Sigma-Aldrich), dehydrated and embedded in paraffin. For 
cryosections, freshly dissected organs were embedded with Tissue-Tek Optimal Cutting 
Temperature compound (VWR International). Cryomoulds were then frozen in a metal 
beaker with isopentane cooled in liquid nitrogen and sections were stored in − 80 °C. Total 
collagen was stained with Masson’s trichrome stain kit (HT15, Sigma-Aldrich) according to 
the manufacturer’s instructions. Images of the sections were captured and blue-stained 
fibrotic areas were semiquantitatively determined with ImageJ software (version 1.49). For 
immunohistochemistry, the tissue sections were incubated with anti-ACTA2 antibody 
(ab5694, Abcam). Primary antibody staining was visualized using an ImmPRESS HRP 
Anti-Rabbit IgG Polymer Detection kit (Vector Laboratories) with ImmPACT DAB 
Peroxidase Substrate (Vector Laboratories) as the chromogen. The sections were then 
counterstained with Mayer’s haematoxylin (Merck). Detection of GFP expression was 
performed according to established protocols43. Each histology experiment was repeated 
independently with similar results as follows: Fig. 3a myocardial infarction model, n = 5; 
Fig. 3f Col1a1–GFP model, n = 3; Fig. 3j Il-11-Tg model, n = 4; Fig. 4b AngII model, n = 4; 
Fig. 4f TAC model, n = 3, Fig. 4j FA model, n = 4; Extended Data Fig. 7i rmIL-11 model, n 
= 3.
Statistical analysis
Statistical analyses of high-content imaging, qPCR and protein data were performed using 
GraphPad Prism software (version 6.07). Fluorescence intensity (collagen I, POSTN) was 
normalized to the number of cells detected in the field and recorded for seven fields per well. 
Cells expressing ACTA2 were quantified and the percentage of activated fibroblasts 
(ACTA2+) was determined for each field. Outliers (ROUT 2%, GraphPad Prism software) 
were removed before analysis. When several experimental groups were compared to one 
condition (that is, to unstimulated cells), we corrected P values according to Dunnett’s. 
When we compared several conditions within one experiment, we corrected for multiple 
testing according to Sidak. The criterion for statistical significance was P < 0.05 (*P < 0.05, 
**P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, ****P < 0.0001).

were incubated for 24 h with indicated concentrations of recombinant human or mouse 
IL-11. Fibroblast activation was monitored using the Operetta High-Content Imaging 
platform and immunostaining for ACTA2. rhIL-11 was found to inefficiently activate mouse 
fibroblasts (rmIL-11, n = 2, rhIL-11, n = 4 biologically independent samples) compared to 
rmIL-11; this occurred for rhIL-11 treatment with rhIL-11 from two separate suppliers. f, g, 
MMP-2 (f) and TIMP-1 (g) concentration in the supernatant (ELISA) of cardiac fibroblasts 
(n = 4 biologically independent samples) without stimulus (−), with TGFβ1 or IL-11 (5 ng

MMP-2 and TIMP-1 protein. i, In vitro monolayer scratch wound assay of cardiac 
fibroblasts. Wound closure was compared between stimulated (TGFβ1 or IL-11; 5 ng ml−1, 
24 h) and unstimulated cardiac fibroblasts (n = 5 biologically independent samples) after 24 
h. j, Cardiac fibroblasts (n = 3 biologically independent samples) were seeded in collagen 
gel and the contraction was monitored. The area of contraction is compared between 
stimulated (TGFβ1 or IL-11; 5 ng ml−1) and unstimulated groups after 72 h. k, Trans-well 
migration assay. After 24 h of stimulation (TGFβ1 or IL-11; 5 ng ml−1), cardiac fibroblasts 
(n = 6 biologically independent samples) that crossed the membrane towards either a 
TGFβ1- or IL-11-containing compartment were colourimetrically quantified and compared 
to data from unstimulated cells. l–n, Cardiac fibroblasts were incubated with TGFβ1 (5 ng 
ml−1, 24 h) and indicated amounts of IL11RA:gp130 decoy receptors (l; 33 amino acid (aa) 
or 50 aa linker peptide), anti-IL11RA antibody (m; 2 μg ml−1) or siRNA pools against IL-11 
or IL11RA (n). l–n, Fibroblast activation was monitored via immunostaining for ACTA2 on 
the Operetta platform. decoy receptors (l): n = 7 measurements per n = 2 independent 
experiments; anti- IL11RA (m): n = 7 measurements per n = 2 independent experiments; 
siRNA (n): Operetta assay n = 7 measurements per n = 10 independent experiments. o, 
Human renal fibroblasts were incubated with TGFβ1 or IL-11 (5 ng ml−1, 24 h) in the 
presence or absence of anti-IL-11 or an IgG control antibodies (2 μg ml−1 each) for 24 h. 
ECM was assessed using the Operetta platform by staining for collagen I. Fluorescence was 
normalized to non-stimulated cells (black). p, These results were confirmed with Sirius red 
assay of the total collagen in the supernatant. q, rmIl-11 stimulation (5 ng ml−1, 24 h) also 
activated mouse cardiac and renal fibroblasts. Myofibroblasts and ECM were assessed using 
the Operetta platform by staining for ACTA2, collagen I or POSTN. Fluorescence was 
normalized to non-stimulated cells (black). o–q, These experiments were repeated three 
times with similar results. r, Cardiac fibroblasts analysed on the Operetta high-content 
imaging platform with immunostaining of ACTA2 after 24 h incubation without stimulus, 
TGFβ1 (5 ng ml−1, 24h) or TGFβ1 and IL-6-neutralizing antibody (2 μg ml−1, 24h). 
Automated quantification of fluorescence (Operetta assay n = 7 measurements per n = 6 
independent experiments) shows no significant decrease in fibroblast activation using anti-
IL-6 antibodies. Data are mean and circles show individual values (e) or mean ± s.d. and

 TIMP1 (e) in response to IL-11 treatment (5 ng ml−1, 24 h) compared to unstimulated cells. 
IL-11 does not significantly upregulate these genes at the RNA level in cardiac fibroblasts (n 
= 4 biologically independent samples). f, Sirius red assay reveals significant increase in 
collagen protein. g, ELISA reveals increase in MMP-2 protein in the supernatant of the 
samples (shown in Fig. 2b, n = 6 biologically independent samples) that lack a change in 
RNA transcripts. h, Concentration of IL11RA (ELISA) in the supernatant of cardiac 
fibroblasts (n = 3 biologically independent samples) after TGFβ1 stimulation (5 ng ml−1, 24 
h). i, Cardiac fibroblasts were incubated with increasing concentrations of a fusion protein 
consisting of IL-11 and IL11RA connected with a linker peptide that recapitulates the 
features of the IL-11 trans-signalling complex. Concentrations as low as 200 pg ml−1 
significantly activated cardiac fibroblasts as measured using a highcontent imaging platform 
and staining for ACTA2 expression (Operetta assay n = 7 measurements per n = 4 
independent experiments). j, k, rhIL-11 (j) and hyperIL-11 (k) were added at indicated 
concentrations and subsequently measured using a commercially available IL-11 ELISA (n 
= 1 independent experiment). The ELISA did not detect rhIL-11 or hyperIL-11. We note that 
the reactivity to rhIL-11 was variable dependent on batch and provider and rhIL-11 was 
sometimes detected. However, in all experiments presented in the main figures, we 
confirmed that the rhIL-11 used was not detectable by the ELISA by additional 
measurements. This ELISA reliably detected native IL-11 secreted by human fibroblasts. l, 
Cardiac fibroblasts (n = 3 biologically independent samples) were incubated (8 h) with 
hyperIL-11 (0.2 ng ml−1) in the presence of absence of the inhibitor of protein translation, 
cyclohexamide (CHX, 5 μg ml−1), or protein secretion, brefeldin A (BFA, 1 μg ml−1). Both 
inhibitors block the increase in IL-11 protein in the supernatant in response to hyperIL-11 
treatment. m, Western blot and ELISA of IL-11 in cardiac fibroblasts after hyperIL-11, the 
inhibitor of the Golgi secretory pathway BFA and/or the translation inhibitor CHX treatment 
shows de novo protein synthesis and canonical secretion of IL-11 after stimulation. n, 
ELISA (n = 9 biologically independent samples) and RT–qPCR (n = 5 biologically 
independent samples) assays show an increase in endogenous IL-11 protein but not RNA 
over time after rhIL-11 (5 ng ml−1) treatment. o, ERK signalling pathway activation by 
TGFβ1 and IL-11. Western blots show activation of the non-canonical MEK–ERK– RSK 
cascade in response to IL-11 stimulation of human cardiac fibroblasts. Here the response 
was greatest at 15 min in the two patients analysed, but more prolonged ERK activation was 
also seen in additional experiments. p, Downstream substrates of ERK, such as eIF4E, were 
also phosphorylated by rhIL-11. q, TGFβ1 also activates the ERK pathway. The time course 
and degree of activation was variable between patients. r, Collagen secretion (Sirius red) 
from cardiac fibroblasts (control, n = 6; TGFβ1, n = 6; TGFβ1 + U0126, n = 3; TGFβ1 + 
PD98059, n = 3; IL-11, n = 6; IL-11 + U0126, n = 3; IL-11 + PD98059, n = 3 biologically 
independent samples) induced by TGFβ1 or IL-11 (5 ng ml−1, 24 h) is reduced by two 
separate MEK inhibitors (10 μM). s, Western blot of total protein levels of key signalling 
molecules in fibroblasts after 24 h stimulation with AngII (100 nM), CTGF (50 ng ml−1), 
EDN1 (250 ng ml−1), bFGF (10 ng ml−1), IL-13 (100 ng ml−1), OSM (100 ng ml−1), PDGF

 biologically independent samples) after TGFβ1 stimulation (5 ng ml−1, 24 h) are highly 
correlated. Spearman’s correlation shows that RNA levels of fibrosis genes are upregulated 
equally in both genotypes. b, Wild-type and knockout fibroblasts (n = 3 biologically 
independent samples) were incubated with TGFβ1 (5 ng ml−1, 24 h) and RNA-seq was 
performed to detect differentially expressed genes using DEseq2. All genes regulated by 
TGFβ1 in wild-type cells are plotted with decreasing − log2(Padjusted). The P value of the 
same genes in stimulated Il11ra1−/− cells are plotted to the right. A similar P-value 
distribution suggests that TGFβ1-driven RNA expression changes are still present in the 
absence of IL-11 signalling showing that loss of Il11ra1 does not influence the TGFβ1-
driven transcriptional response. c, d, Primary atrial fibroblasts were prepared from Il11ra1+/+ 
(c) or Il11ra1−/− (d) mice were incubated for 24 h without stimulus or with TGFβ1 (5 ng ml
−1), IL-11 (5 ng ml−1) or AngII (100 nM). Cells were stained with antibodies against 
ACTA2, collagen I or POSTN. Images were taken at low magnification (10×) on the 
Operetta imaging platform. As shown, fibroblasts from knockout mice do not respond to 
pro-fibrotic stimuli at the level of pro-fibrotic protein expression. This experiment was 
repeated four times with similar results. e, Circulating markers of inflammation after rmIl-11 
injection (100 μg kg−1 per day, three weeks; n = 14 biologically independent samples). f,

independent samples and compared between samples from rmIl-11-treated and control mice. 
i, Representative histological images of the heart and kidney after rmIl-11 injection indicate 
increased collagen content according to Masson’s trichrome staining. This experiment was 
repeated three times with similar results. j, RNA expression (RT–qPCR) of fibrosis genes in 
heart (n = 12 biologically independent samples) and kidney (n = 11 biologically independent 
samples) after rmIl-11 treatment compared to control. k, RNA expression (RT–qPCR) of 
fibrosis genes in heart (control, n = 6; Il-11-Tg, n = 3 biologically independent samples) and 
kidney (control, n = 7; Il-11-Tg, n = 4 biologically independent samples) of tamoxifen-
treated Il-11-Tg, Col1a2–CreER and control mice. l, Cardiac fibroblasts were incubated with 
TGFβ1 or IL-11 (5 ng ml−1) and EdU (10 μM ml−1, 24 h), which was used to detect 
replicating DNA by fluorescence by automated quantification of images (Operetta assay n = 
7 measurements per n = 6 independent experiments). This analysis reveals a significant 
increase in fibroblast proliferation (EdU+ ells) induced by both TGFβ1 and IL-11. The 
percentage of EdU+ cells was normalized to the average detected in non-stimulated cells. m, 
Cells were incubated with TGFβ1 (5 ng ml−1, 24 h) and either an IgG control or anti-IL-11 
antibody (2 μg ml−1, 24 h). High-content imaging (Operetta assay n = 7 measurements per n 
= 6 independent experiments) and quantification of proliferating cells show that anti-IL-11 
antibodies significantly reduce the effects of TGFβ1 on fibroblast proliferation. The 
percentage of EdU+ ells was normalized to the average detected in cells stimulated with 
TGFβ1 and IgG control. n, Western blots show an increase in Il-11 protein expression in the 
heart and kidney after tamoxifen treatment in Il-11-Tg, Col1a2–CreER mice. o, Il-11 
transgenic mice were crossed with a Col1a2- promoter, tamoxifen-inducible Cre mouse
