Prions, prionoids and protein misfolding disorders
Scheckel, Claudia; Aguzzi, Adriano
Abstract: Prion diseases are progressive, incurable and fatal neurodegenerative conditions. The term
‘prion’ was first nominated to express the revolutionary concept that a protein could be infectious. We
now know that prions consist of PrPSc, the pathological aggregated form of the cellular prion protein
PrPC. Over the years, the term has been semantically broadened to describe aggregates irrespective of
their infectivity, and the prion concept is now being applied, perhaps overenthusiastically, to all neurode-
generative diseases that involve protein aggregation. Indeed, recent studies suggest that prion diseases
(PrDs) and protein misfolding disorders (PMDs) share some common disease mechanisms, which could
have implications for potential treatments. Nevertheless, the transmissibility of bona fide prions is unique,
and PrDs should be considered as distinct from other PMDs.

ABSTRACT  
1 
Prion diseases are progressive, incurable and fatal neurodegenerative conditions. The term “prion” was

first nominated to express the revolutionary concept that a protein could be infectious. We now know 
3 
that prions consist of PrPSc, an aggregated form of the cellular protein PrPC. Over the years, the term

has been semantically broadened to describe aggregates irrespective of their infectivity and the prion 
5 
concept is now being applied, perhaps overenthusiastically, to all neurodegenerative diseases that 
6 
involve protein aggregation. Indeed, recent studies suggest that prion diseases (PrDs) and protein 
7 
misfolding disorders (PMDs) share some common disease mechanisms, which could have implications 
8 
for potential treatments. Nevertheless, the transmissibility of bona fide prions is unique and PrDs should

be considered as distinct from other PMDs.

 [H1] INTRODUCTION 
12 
Prion diseases [G] (PrDs), which are also termed transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs), 
13 
are fatal neurodegenerative diseases characterized by neuronal loss, vacuolation, astrocyte activation 
14 
and microglia activation. PrDs can undergo extraordinarily long incubation periods ranging from years 
15 
to decades. However, when the clinical signs become evident, the course of the disease is often 
16 
dramatic1.  
17 
The term prion [G] was originally coined to describe the infectious proteinaceous agent causing PrDs2, 
18 
and did not have a specific biophysical meaning attached to it. Subsequently, prions were shown to 
19 
consist primarily of PrPSc 3, aggregates [G] of the cellular prion protein PrPC 4. Misfolded PrPC is 
20 
incorporated into heterodisperse, fibrillary beta-sheet rich structures, which are termed amyloids. Other 
21 
proteins can also form amyloids, which have been associated with numerous other protein-misfolding 
22 
disorders (PMDs) [G]. 
23 
Prions are thought to multiply by a nucleation-and-fragmentation process akin to the growth of 
24 
crystals5,6: highly ordered PrPSc oligomers incorporate endogenous PrPC, thereby growing in size 
25 
(Figure 1). Large PrPSc aggregates may then decay into smaller fragments of various sizes, each of 
26 
 Page | 3 
 
which can restart the nucleation-fragmentation cycle. The minimal self-replicating unit of misfolded 
1 
aggregates is called a propagon [G]7. A propagon reflects the biological activity of the prion rather than 
2 
a specific structural entity. Accordingly, a prion sample containing many smaller oligomers has a higher 
3 
number of propagons than one containing larger fibrils. Prions show a remarkable resistance to 
4 
proteases, heat and decontamination methods, which has proven to be a major challenge for the 
5 
prevention of PrDs. Yet, protease resistance of prions only correlates loosely with infectivity: the 
6 
majority of infectivity is associated with protease-sensitive oligomers8. 
7 
The process of generating infectious PrPSc has been reproduced in vitro9, which has provided substantial 
8 
evidence that prion infectivity depends on PrPSc. In vitro amplification of PrPSc allows the detection of 
9 
minute amounts of prions and has been adopted for the diagnosis of PrDs (Box 1). Since the 
10 
incorporation of PrPC is required for prion replication, mice lacking PrPC are resistant to prion 
11 
infection4,10,11. While it is widely accepted that PrPSc is an essential component of the infectious agent, 
12 
additional co-factors are likely to play a part in prion replication in vivo12. Interestingly, while PrPC is 
13 
abundantly expressed throughout the body, prion deposition as well as vulnerability to prion toxicity 
14 
varies profoundly between tissues13. The observation that different cell types show distinct 
15 
susceptibilities to prion infection and toxicity further suggests that additional components (proteins or 
16 
otherwise) can affect the ability of prions to replicate and/or exert toxicity.  
17 
An increasing number of neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer’s Disease (AD), 
18 
Parkinson’s Disease (PD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), but also metabolic diseases and 
19 
cancer have now been linked to protein misfolding and aggregation14,15. While protein aggregation may 
20 
conceivably lead to protein inactivation via sequestration, the aggregates themselves can exert toxicity 
21 
by interfering with intracellular functions or cell-to-cell signaling. Several protein aggregates linked to 
22 
these disorders have been shown, like prions, to undergo cycles of nucleation and fragmentation. Unlike 
23 
for prions, no inter-individual transmissibility has yet been demonstrated for any of these aggregates - 
24 
we therefore introduced the term “prionoids” [G]14,15 to describe these aggregates. However, shared 
25 
characteristics with prions combined with the high prevalence of many prionoid-mediated PMDs have 
26 
raised concerns related to the handling of prionoids15. 
27

In this Review, we provide an overview of the current understanding of prions and PrDs. We discuss 
1 
similarities and important distinctions between PrDs and prionoid-mediated PMDs and their respective 
2 
aggregates, and comment on the implications for the diagnosis, treatment and containment of these 
3 
diseases. Finally, we highlight different therapeutic strategies that aim to prevent or eliminate 
4 
pathological protein aggregation and are therefore relevant to PMDs in general.

[H1] PRION DISEASE  
7 
[H2] Forms of prion diseases. Human PrDs can be grouped into genetic, sporadic and acquired forms 
8 
and have an overall incidence of 1-2 cases per million. All PrDs are characterized by an accumulation 
9 
of PrPSc in the central nervous system, either in the form of plaques or as synaptic deposits. Genetic 
10 
PrDs (gPrDs) are all caused by mutations in the PRNP gene, which encodes PrPC, and include genetic 
11 
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (gCJD), Fatal Familial Insomnia (FFI) and Gerstmann-Straeussler-Scheinker 
12 
Syndrome (GSS) (Figure 2). By contrast, sporadic CJD (sCJD) and sporadic FFI have an unknown 
13 
etiology despite sCJD being the most common form of human PrDs, accounting for 85-90% of all cases. 
14 
Acquired PrDs are induced by transmission of pre-existing prions and they include: variant CJD 
15 
(vCJD), which is caused by bovine prions16; iatrogenic CJD (iCJD), which is transmitted by medical 
16 
procedures; and kuru in Papa New Guinea, which is acquired as a result of cannibalistic rituals. PrDs 
17 
occur in many mammalian species, most notably as bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE or mad 
18 
cow disease)17, scrapie in sheep and goats, and chronic wasting disease in deer and elk18. Prions from 
19 
one species are usually less infectious to individuals of another species, reflecting a species barrier. 
20 
However, PrDs can also be transmitted between species, albeit with variable efficiency19.  
21 
[H2] PrPC is required for prion diseases to occur. Although PrPC was first linked to PrDs decades ago, 
22 
its cellular function is not entirely understood. The 253 amino acid membrane protein (Figure 2a) is 
23 
evolutionarily conserved from birds to mammals and comprises: a flexible tail at the N-terminus, which 
24 
spans two charge clusters (CC1 and CC2); an octapeptide repeat region (OR); a hydrophobic domain 
25 
(HD)20; and a C-terminal globular domain, consisting of three a-helices and two short antiparallel b-
26 
sheets21. A glycosyl phosphoinositol (GPI) modification at residue 230 anchors PrPC to the plasma 
27 
 Page | 5 
 
membrane. Addition of oligosaccharides at residues 181 and 197 gives rise to different glycosylated 
1 
forms of PrPC, and facilitates the correct localization of PrPC to the plasma membrane. Initial functional 
2 
analysis performed in Prnp deficient mice with a mixed genetic background suggested a number of 
3 
functions for PrPC, including a role in regulating long-term potentiation, which underlies memory 
4 
formation22. However, careful replication of experiments in perfectly co-isogenic mice has clarified that 
5 
some phenotypes, such as enhanced phagocytosis, are due to polymorphisms [G] in genes flanking 
6 
Prnp23, including Sirpa24, which encodes the signal regulatory peptide a. Nonetheless, all Prnp deficient 
7 
mice develop a chronic demyelinating neuropathy23,25, and PrPC has been shown to promote myelin 
8 
homeostasis by activating the G protein-coupled receptor Gpr126 on Schwann cells26. The availability 
9 
of co-isogenic Prnp deficient mice now allows a thorough reassessment of functions previously 
10 
attributed to PrPC, and is likely to reveal novel PrPC functions.  
11 
 
12 
[H2] Mutations in PRNP are linked to genetic prion disease. All known gPrDs are caused by 
13 
mutations in the PRNP gene, which usually have full penetrance [G] (Figure 2b). Most of the mutations 
14 
are localized in the second and third alpha helix, and are thought to induce PrPC misfolding and, 
15 
ultimately, pathological aggregates via a mechanism that is poorly understood. GSS is characterized by 
16 
large, multicentric amyloid plaques and the most commonly associated mutation is a proline-to-leucine 
17 
substitution at codon 102 (P102L)27. By contrast, FFI is caused by an asparagine and a methionine at 
18 
positions 178 (D178N) and 129, respectively28. The D178N mutation has additionally been shown to 
19 
cause gCJD, if in conjunction with a valine at residue 129 (ref 29). The polymorphism at position 129 
20 
has since been observed to affect the aggregation propensity of D178N mutant PrPC into amyloid fibrils 
21 
in vitro, but the underlying mechanism is unknown30. Several other point mutations, most notably 
22 
E200K31 and V210I32, have been associated with gCJD (Figure 2), many of which reside in the globular 
23 
domain at the C-terminus and disrupt potential salt bridge or hydrogen bonding interactions33. In 
24 
addition, insertions of additional octapeptide repeats cause gCJD and affect the aggregation propensity 
25 
of PrPC.  
26 
 [H2] PRNP polymorphisms modulate susceptibility to prion disease. PrDs are classified as a single 
27 
 Page | 6 
 
homogenous disease, however it has become evident that prions can cause many different molecular 
1 
and clinical phenotypes, possibly reflecting the existence of distinct structural assemblies, also termed 
2 
prion strains [G]34. Indeed, PRNP polymorphisms have been shown to influence the predisposition 
3 
towards sporadic, variant and genetic PrDs (Figure 2b) in a prion-strain dependent manner. An 
4 
important disease-modifying polymorphism exists at codon 129, which can encode either valine (V) or 
5 
methionine(M)35. Allele frequencies vary between populations: in the UK, 47% of the normal 
6 
population are heterozygous at this locus, and 42% and 11% are homozygous for M and V, 
7 
respectively36. Homozygosity for either amino acid predisposes to sCJD and leads to an earlier onset of 
8 
gPrD37 and all but one out of >300 vCJD patients identified to date have been homozygous for 
9 
methionine at codon 129 (ref 38). Moreover, three of the four individuals that died of vCJD after having 
10 
received contaminated blood transfusions were homozygous for methionine at codon 129 (ref 39,40). By 
11 
contrast, the fourth individual was 129Met/Val heterozygous, displayed prion protein deposition only in 
12 
the spleen and lymph nodes, showed no signs of a neurological disorder, and died of a ruptured 
13 
abdominal aortic aneurysm41. This suggests that while subjects with MV and VV versions of PRNP 
14 
might be able to succumb to vCJD infection, the incubation time in these patients will be significantly 
15 
longer. Consequently, it has been argued that a large number of individuals may be infected with PrD 
16 
but remain asymptomatic, and that these individuals might unknowingly transmit the disease during the 
17 
prolonged incubation periods. While this is theoretically possible, no evidence has come forward to 
18 
support this idea. Interestingly, MV heterozygosity confers protection against vCJD but not against 
19 
kuru42. 
20 
A different polymorphism has been found to affect susceptibility to sCJD in the Japanese population. 
21 
Codon 219 can encode either glutamic acid or lysine, and 14% of the population has been reported to 
22 
be heterozygous at this codon (the remaining 86% are homozygous for glutamic acid). However, no 
23 
heterozygous sCJD patients have been identified to date, which suggests that heterozygosity at codon 
24 
219 may protect individuals from developing sCJD43. More recently, another protective polymorphism, 
25 
this time at codon 127, has been described specifically in populations from kuru-exposed regions. 
26 
Interestingly, heterozygosity for glycine and valine was observed in non-diseased individuals but not 
27 
 Page | 7 
 
in patients with kuru, who were all homozygous for valine42. The G127V variant was further assessed 
1 
in mice, revealing that it conferred protection not only against kuru but also against classical CJD prion 
2 
strains44.  
3 
 
4 
[H2] Non-PRNP genetic susceptibility factors. The low incidence of PrDs renders the discovery of 
5 
genetic modulators of PrD a major challenge, and genome-wide association studies revealed only PRNP 
6 
to being highly associated with a risk for all human PrDs45-47. A recent study aimed to quantify PrD 
7 
penetrance by leveraging previously published datasets. The authors collected sequencing data from 
8 
~16,000 PrD cases from around the world, constituting a substantial fraction of all documented PrD 
9 
cases to date. The PrD cases were then compared to a control group consisting of ~61,000 exomes from 
10 
unrelated individuals and GWAS data from ~530,000 customers of the genetic analysis company, 
11 
23andMe. Remarkably, in these large control population cohorts, 63 rare PRNP genetic variants 
12 
previously reported to cause PrD were observed 30 times more often than expected based on the 
13 
incidence of gPrDs. The overrepresentation of PRNP mutations was not limited to specific ethnic or 
14 
demographic groups but was observed in populations of diverse ancestries48. While several of these 
15 
variants might in fact represent benign or low-risk variants, this data nonetheless suggests the existence 
16 
of non-genetic factors that affect disease manifestation. Environmental factors have been found to affect 
17 
the pathogenesis of most diseases characterized to date and are therefore certain to also contribute to 
18 
PrDs. It is also possible that some healthy subjects with PRNP mutations have developed mechanisms 
19 
that protect them from developing disease. One tantalizing hypothesis is that these individuals produce 
20 
PrPSc-specific antibodies that shield them against the pathogenic effects of PRNP mutations.  
21 
 
22 
[H1] PRIONOID-MEDIATED DISORDERS  
23 
The term ‘prion’ has been liberally used for many protein aggregates. Yet bona fide infectivity of these 
24 
aggregates, exemplified by serial transmissibility through consecutive hosts to prove unlimited self-
25 
replication of the agent, has been rarely claimed. Mammalian protein aggregates that are defined as 
26 
prions will need to be handled in accordance with high level biosafety measures, which may include 
27 
 Page | 8 
 
the requirement for BSL3 laboratories. As we believe that the necessity of such measures should be 
1 
determined by data rather than imprecise semantics, we have proposed that the term ‘prionoid’ should 
2 
be used to describe misfolded protein aggregates for which transmissibility between individuals has not 
3 
yet been demonstrated14,15.  
4 
 
5 
[H2] Non-neuronal prionoids. The transcriptional regulator p53 has long been known to be a tumor 
6 
suppressor, and p53 mutations have been detected in >50% of human malignant tumors. More recently, 
7 
mutated p53 has been shown to form aggregates in tumors and cancer cell lines49,50. Mutations in the 
8 
p53 DNA binding domain destabilize its tertiary structure, leading to the exposure of an aggregation-
9 
nucleating segment (also termed amyloid adhesive segment) that is normally buried within the 
10 
hydrophobic core of the protein. The exposure of this fragment is then thought to trigger the aggregation 
11 
of wild type p53 and its paralogs, p63 and p73, into beta-sheet-like structures, which form large 
12 
cytoplasmic inclusions49. Additionally, p53 aggregates have been shown to spread between cells in a 
13 
manner that is similar to cell-to-cell transmission of prions51,52. Indeed, mice and patients harboring p53 
14 
aggregation mutations have higher tumor numbers than those with non-agreggation mutations, and 
15 
tumor formation is dependent on the presence of aggregation-prone p5353. These findings demonstrate 
16 
that p53 is a bone fide prionoid, and indicate that p53 aggregation and cell-to-cell transmission play an 
17 
important role in metastasis formation.  
18 
Misfolded aggregates of islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP) accumulate in the pancreas and are 
19 
commonly observed in type 2 diabetes (T2D) patients. IAPP aggregates that have either been generated 
20 
in vitro or obtained from pancreatic samples induce the misfolding and deposition of endogenous IAPP 
21 
in mice, confirming IAPP to be a prionoid. Importantly, IAPP deposition is accompanied by typical 
22 
T2D traits such as hyperglycemia, impaired glucose tolerance and a decrease in pancreatic b-cells, 
23 
indicating that IAPP accumulation plays an important role in T2D manifestation54. 
24 
Although protein aggregation usually occurs in specific organs, several PMDs are characterized by 
25 
systemic aggregate deposition. Examples include aggregation of immunoglobulin light chain in 
26 
amyloid light (AL) amyloidosis, transthyretin in familial amyloid polyneuropathy, b2-microglobulin in 
27 
 Page | 9 
 
dialysis-related amyloidosis and amyloid A (AA) in reactive amyloid A amyloidosis. It has been 
1 
suggested that transmission of these aggregates can occur between multiple species, indicating that they 
2 
might not only qualify as prionoids but even as prions, with the evidence being strongest for AA 55. 
3 
 
4 
[H2] Prionoids linked to neurodegeneration. Aggregates of a–synuclein have been linked to multiple 
5 
neurodegenerative diseases, including multiple system atrophy (MSA), dementia with Lewy bodies 
6 
(DLB) and PD. Intracerebral inoculation of mice with brain homogenate from MSA patients induces 
7 
a–synuclein phosphorylation and aggregation and neurological phenotypes, even upon serial 
8 
propagation56,57. The detection of infectivity after multiple passages is a hallmark of prions, suggesting 
9 
that a–synuclein might indeed be a prion. However, the development of CNS dysfunction in these mice 
10 
is dependent on the presence of a hemizygous transgene encoding an aggregation-prone mutant form 
11 
of human a–synuclein, which by itself did not cause neurological dysfunction. This raises questions as 
12 
to whether only mutated a–synuclein can be incorporated into a–synuclein aggregates, or whether the 
13 
requirement for a transgene reflects an inter-species barrier similar to that observed for known prions 
14 
58. Interestingly, neither PD nor DLB patient homogenates could induce neurological dysfunction in 
15 
mice hemizygous for the mutated human a–synuclein transgene. This result indicates that the a–
16 
synuclein aggregates from different diseases not only vary in the cell type in which they are found 
17 
(neuronal inclusions in DLB and PD; glial inclusions in MSA), but also in their potential to be 
18 
propagated in mice. MSA-associated a–synuclein inclusions in glia cells might be more infectious due 
19 
to their glial origin, however MSA homogenates can also induce a–synuclein aggregation in neurons57. 
20 
A recent study showed that even spinal cord homogenates prepared from wild-type and a–synuclein 
21 
deficient mice could induce a–synuclein deposits and CNS dysfunction in mice hemizygous for the 
22 
mutated human a–synuclein transgene59. This observation suggests that these homogenates contain a 
23 
component that can trigger a–synuclein pathology in the presence of mutated human a–synuclein. 
24 
Perhaps even more worrisome are reports on human PD patients that received embryonic neuronal 
25 
transplants. Despite the young age of the transplanted neurons, the grafts displayed synuclein inclusions 
26 
 Page | 10 
 
10-24 years post-transplantation, showing that synuclein aggregates were able to spread from host to 
1 
graft in a prion-like manner60-64.  
2 
AD is characterized by amyloid-b (Ab) deposition, which has been shown to follow a stereotypic 
3 
sequence that involves progressively larger brain areas65. The injection of human AD brain 
4 
homogenates containing Ab aggregates causes cerebral b-amyloidosis and pathology in mice. 
5 
Importantly, Ab-immunodepleted homogenates failed to induce lesions, suggesting that induction of 
6 
amyloidosis is dependent on Ab66. However, similar to synuclein, the induction of Ab pathology in 
7 
mice depends on the overexpression of Ab. Further experiments demonstrated that Ab alone is indeed 
8 
sufficient for self-propagation in vitro and that the in vitro generated Ab aggregates are able to induce 
9 
amyloidosis67. Interestingly, it has recently been shown that eight deceased individuals that contracted 
10 
iCJD via human growth hormone (hGH) injections also display Ab pathology68. These findings were 
11 
confirmed in a separate study, which additionally detected Ab accumulation in 12 hGH recipients that 
12 
died of a cause other than CJD69. It remains unclear if the hGH samples were the source of Ab 
13 
aggregation, and the patients did not show any signs of tau pathology, a second hallmark of AD. 
14 
Nonetheless, these subjects might represent the first known cases of iatrogenic Ab transmission. 
15 
Consistently, iCJD caused by dural grafting has been shown to be associated with Ab pathology70, 
16 
making Ab a candidate prion.  
17 
Tau pathology is not only characteristic of AD but also of multiple other neurodegenerative disorders. 
18 
Similarly to other prionoids, Tau aggregates spread throughout the brain in an orderly fashion that is 
19 
characteristic for each tauopathy, ultimately leading to distinct Tau pathologies71. However, the cause 
20 
of Tau aggregation in the different diseases is still mostly unknown. The injection of AD homogenates 
21 
containing Tau aggregates into mice has been shown to induce Tau aggregation, even in wildtype 
22 
mice72. Furthermore, a recent study revealed that some hGH-related iCJD patients display tau pathology 
23 
that seems to be linked to Tau contaminants in the respective hGH samples73. While these results might 
24 
have far-reaching implications for the handling of tauopathy patients and samples, further validation is 
25 
required to confirm the transmission of Tau aggregates between individuals before it can be considered 
26

a prion.

[H1] MEDIATORS AND MODULATORS OF TOXICITY  
3 
[H2] Mechanisms underlying aggregation differ between protein misfolding disorders. The formation 
4 
of extracellular and intracellular protein aggregates can exert toxicity both in the extracellular space and 
5 
within the cell. Furthermore, aggregation goes hand in hand with the sequestration of monomeric 
6 
protein, which can cause additional deleterious effects. For example, the deleterious effects of p53 
7 
aggregation in cancer seem to be associated with sequestration of p53 rather than with the aggregates49. 
8 
By contrast, the toxicity of PMDs affecting the nervous system seems to be exerted by the aggregates 
9 
themselves. Some of the aggregated proteins possess a low-complexity domain that is intrinsically 
10 
disordered and enriched for polar uncharged residues, particularly glutamine and asparagine74. Such 
11 
domains have been called “prion-like” owing to their similarity to certain nucleating proteins of yeast. 
12 
However, PrPC lacks such a domain, indicating that the early aggregation events leading to the 
13 
formation of prions and prionoids are distinct. Indeed, certain proteins involved in neurodegeneration 
14 
undergo phase demixing [G] 75, a recently discovered aggregation modality that is often reversible and 
15 
fundamentally different from the aggregation of prions. 
16 
While the cause, the location and the aggregates themselves differ, certain parallels between the 
17 
different PMDs can be legitimately drawn. For instance, oligomers of misfolded proteins are more 
18 
pathogenic than higher-order structures such as protofilaments and fibrils8, possibly because of their 
19 
higher stoichiometry. Furthermore, disparate aggregates often trigger converging pathways of toxicity. 
20 
Hence insights gained for one PMD may be relevant for others.  
21 
[H2] Uncoupling protein aggregation and toxicity. Neurons devoid of PrPC do not develop spongiform 
22 
changes even when chronically exposed to prions in vivo11, suggesting that PrPC is not only needed for 
23 
prion replication, but that it also functions as a mediator of prion toxicity. Additionally, this observation 
24 
indicates that extracellular PrP deposits are not toxic per se but that binding of aggregates to membrane-
25 
bound PrPC is required to induce toxicity within cells. This hypothesis is further supported by the 
26 
observation that protective PrPC-directed antibodies prevent neurotoxicity without affecting prion 
27 
 Page | 12 
 
accumulation76. Antibodies against PrPC were shown to be protective against PrD in mice almost two 
1 
decades ago77 and a series of monoclonal antibodies targeting different domains of PrPC has since

proven useful for studying the mechanism of prion-induced toxicity78. Protective antibodies binding to 
3 
the flexible tail (FT) of PrPC, as well as FT deletion mutants of PrPC, revealed that FT is required for 
4 
prion replication in vivo and is the effector domain of PrPSc-mediated toxicity76. By contrast, antibodies 
5 
targeting the globular domain (GD) of PrPC induce transcriptional changes and phenotypic changes 
6 
remarkably similar to those induced by prions, including neuronal loss, astrogliosis, microglial 
7 
activation, and spongiosis79. Anti-GD antibodies and prions also activate similar toxicity pathways ex 
8 
vivo 76,79,80. However, anti-GD antibodies fail to induce aggregates, infectious prions and prion 
9 
pathology in vivo81, indicating that they act on a pathway downstream of prion replication. The fact that 
10 
PrPC antibodies can be protective or toxic, depending on the targeted domain, has shed light on the 
11 
mechanisms of prion-induced toxicity and has far-reaching implications for immunotherapy of not only 
12 
PrDs but diseases more generally. 
13 
[H2] Aggregation-induced toxicity. The observation that PrPC is required for toxicity suggests that 
14 
precluding protein aggregates from entering the cell might prevent the induction of toxicity and 
15 
neuronal loss. Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain how aggregates enter and spread 
16 
between cells, which involve exosomes82,83, nanotubes84 or receptor-mediated internalization8. 
17 
However, the mechanisms by which extracellular aggregates initiate intracellular toxicity are less clear. 
18 
One possibility is that aggregates alter receptor-mediated signaling pathways. Aberrant glutamate 
19 
signaling has been linked to PrD85-88, which is further supported by the observation that PrPC inhibits 
20 
N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDAR) and attenuates excitotoxicity [G] 89 . Ab oligomers inhibit 
21 
long-term potentiation (LTP) and impair synaptic plasticity, and several receptors have been suggested 
22 
to play a role in internalizing Ab, including PrPC. Indeed, it has been claimed that PrPC is required for 
23 
Ab-induced LTP in hippocampal slices90 and for memory impairment in vivo91. mGluR5 may act as a 
24 
co-receptor for Ab binding to PrPC 92,93, with subsequent NMDAR activation leading to synaptic spine 
25 
loss94,95. Accordingly, increased glutamate signaling has been seen in a mouse AD model96,97 and 
26 
genetic depletion of mGluR5 reduces AD pathology in vivo98. However, the role of PrPC in mediating 
27 
 Page | 13 
 
Ab toxicity is contentious. Several studies suggest that Ab oligomers can induce synaptic defects and 
1 
impair long-term memory formation independently of PrPC 99,100 and neither PrPC ablation nor 
2 
overexpression modified the synaptic pathology in two mouse AD models101,102. These discrepancies 
3 
can likely be explained by differences in study design, including the use of different mouse AD models, 
4 
and will almost certainly be resolved by future studies. More recently, it has been suggested that PrPC 
5 
also mediates the uptake of a–synuclein oligomers103,104. Oligomeric a–synuclein is highly neurotoxic 
6 
and impairs hippocampal LTP via NMDAR activation105. The interaction of a–synuclein and PrPC at 
7 
the post-synapse activates NMDAR via mGluR5, and triggers synaptic defects and cognitive 
8 
impairment104.  
9 
By contrast, intracellular aggregates might mediate toxicity by affecting subcellular compartments, such 
10 
as the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). PrPC undergoes posttranslational modifications in the ER and Golgi 
11 
before localizing to cholesterol-rich lipid rafts at the plasma membrane. PrPC has a short half-life106, 
12 
and approximately 10% is misfolded and subsequently degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome system 
13 
(UPS) after retrograde ER translocation107,108. By contrast, pathogenic mutations linked to gPrD cause 
14 
PrPC to aggregate and remain in the ER and Golgi109-113. Dysfunctional and misfolded proteins are 
15 
usually ubiquitinated and degraded by the UPS, and it has been suggested that this process is inhibited 
16 
by misfolded PrP114-116. The resulting buildup of dysfunctional proteins eventually causes ER stress and 
17 
activates the unfolded protein response (UPR). One consequence of UPR induction is a global shutdown 
18 
of translation, mediated by phosphorylation of PERK, which in turn phosphorylates and deactivates the 
19 
eukaryotic translation initiation factor eIF2a. Prion infection causes a global repression of protein 
20 
synthesis via eIF2a phosphorylation, ultimately leading to synaptic dysfunction and neuronal loss. 
21 
Interestingly, globally increasing translation via eIF2a dephosphorylation reduces neuronal toxicity and 
22 
increases the survival time of prion-exposed mice, whereas increasing eIF2a phosphorylation further 
23 
aggravates prion-induced pathology117. ER stress, as well as activation of the UPR and PERK, have 
24 
also been reported in several other PMDs including AD, PD, ALS, and tauopathy118-123. 
25 
 
26 
[H2] Differential vulnerability of cells and tissues. Protein aggregation has been linked to several non-
27 
 Page | 14 
 
neuronal disorders, including metabolic diseases and cancer, but the brain is the organ most vulnerable 
1 
to protein aggregation. While PMD aggregates are thought to directly exert toxicity on the brain, several 
2 
of their substrates, including PrPC, amyloid precursor protein, a-synuclein and tau, are not exclusively 
3 
expressed in the nervous system124-126. PrPC is expressed at moderate levels in heart, muscle and spleen, 
4 
and prions have been shown to accumulate in these tissues. In fact, prions replicate in peripheral 
5 
lymphoid organs before they reach the brain, and mice that lack B lymphocytes, or follicular dendritic 
6 
cells (FDCs), cannot succumb to PrD if infected by peripheral administration127. These studies 
7 
demonstrate that prion infectivity and pathogenesis are not restricted to the brain, but that prion-diseased 
8 
mice, as well as patients, are likely to succumb to fatal neuronal defects before non-neuronal phenotypes 
9 
can manifest. On the other hand, certain organs never acquire prion replication competence, even when 
10 
forced by transgenesis to express high levels of PrPC 128. It is likely that a combination of substrate 
11 
expression and exceptional vulnerability of neurons account for the predominant neuronal phenotype 
12 
of not only PrD, but also other neurodegenerative PMDs including AD, PD, and ALS.  
13 
Each neurodegenerative disease displays a distinct pathology within the central nervous system, which 
14 
is determined by a variety of factors, including differences in the aggregate structure and localization, 
15 
and selective vulnerabilities of cells and brain regions (Box 2). For example, a–synuclein aggregates 
16 
are present as cytoplasmic inclusions in multiple neurodegenerative diseases including PD, DLB and 
17 
MSA, and yet the affected cell types and brain regions vary substantially between the different diseases. 
18 
The underlying cause for the pathological differences in a–synuclein deposition is unknown but, not 
19 
surprisingly, they result in distinct clinical manifestations129. While pathological changes are usually 
20 
homogenous within one neurodegenerative disease, PrDs are characterized by a spectrum of different 
21 
pathologies and clinical features. One cell type that is particularly vulnerable to prion deposits and other 
22 
protein aggregates is parvalbumin positive inhibitory neurons, which are distinguished by a high firing 
23 
rate and a high metabolic rate, leading to increased exposure to oxygen radicals and intracellular 
24 
damage. Severe selective loss of parvalbumin neurons in the cortex and hippocampus has been observed 
25 
in CJD, GSS and kuru130-132. By contrast, FFI pathology is mostly focused on the thalamus and patients 
26 
show only a moderate loss of cortical parvalbumin neurons132. The differential vulnerability of cells and 
27 
 Page | 15 
 
brain regions indicates that aggregation-induced toxicity can be modulated by the expression of co-
1 
factors, such as receptors and chaperones12. Future studies focusing on single cells, or at least single 
2 
cell types, will therefore be of particular importance in deciphering why various cell types undergo 
3 
distinct fates upon exposure to protein aggregates. The remarkable phenotypic heterogeneity of PrDs is 
4 
further attributed to the different biochemical and neuropathological profiles of the various prion 
5 
strains, which seem to be able to exert differential toxicity, presumably through their interplay with 
6 
additional factors12.  
7 
Immune cells are critical for prion replication and spreading, especially when prions are administered 
8 
via the peripheral route. Similarly to PrP prions, the induction of a–synuclein pathology seems to be 
9 
strongly dependent on the source of the injected homogenate and the route of administration. Mice 
10 
inoculated intracerebrally with homogenates containing a–synuclein aggregates that have been taken 
11 
from MSA patients display a more rapid disease progression compared with intraperitoneally inoculated 
12 
mice133. Ab aggregates were recently shown to be able to enter the brain via the blood stream using a 
13 
parabiosis [G] model in which wildtype mice showed hippocampal impairment upon being paired with 
14 
transgenic AD mice134. This observation is in contrast to prions, which do not enter the nervous system 
15 
via the blood stream but via peripheral, mostly sympathetic, nerves135,136. 
16 
Post-translational modifications have been suggested to impact protein aggregation, replication and 
17 
toxicity. Different PrDs have been linked to distinct ratios of mono- and di-glycosylated PrPC 137, and 
18 
several post-translational modifications have also been implicated in AD pathogenesis. For instance, 
19 
accumulation of N-terminally truncated and pyroglutamated Ab precedes the deposition of non-
20 
modified Ab138, and inhibition of glutaminyl-cyclase, which generates pyroglutamated Ab, improves 
21 
neuronal defects and attenuates AD pathology in mice139. Nitrosative stress has also been shown to be 
22 
induced in AD, which leads to NOS2 mediated addition of 3-nitrotyrosine to proteins, including 
23 
Ab140,141. Nitrated Ab can then induce and accelerate amyloidosis and exacerbate memory loss, both of 
24 
which can be prevented by NOS2 inhibition. Hence targeting disease-specific posttranslational 
25 
modifications of aggregates might represent a promising approach to combat PMDs.  
26 
[H2] Chaperones. Chaperones linked to protein synthesis (CLIPs) stabilize and correctly fold newly 
27 
 Page | 16 
 
synthesized proteins, whereas heat shock proteins (HSPs) recognize misfolded proteins (Figure 1). 
1 
CLIPs are downregulated and HSPs are induced in cells of the aging brain or in response to stress, 
2 
which protects the cells against misfolded protein toxicity. Stress, aging and mutations can induce 
3 
protein misfolding and expose otherwise buried aggregation-prone domains. If not targeted by 
4 
chaperones for either re-folding or proteasomal degradation, these misfolded proteins start to aggregate 
5 
into higher-order structures that are resistant to proteasomal degradation142. Notably, different HSPs 
6 
can have opposing effects on protein aggregation. For example, whereas HSP70 promotes protein 
7 
degradation via the ubiquitin proteasome system, HSP90 stabilizes proteins and inhibits their 
8 
ubiquitination. The activity of these two proteins is regulated in a coordinated manner, with inhibition 
9 
of HSP90 leading to HSP70 activation via HSF1. Compared with wildtype mice, mice lacking 
10 
functional HSF1 have a shortened lifespan when inoculated with prions but the resulting behavioral and 
11 
pathological changes are similar143, which suggests that HSF1 exerts its protective function only after 
12 
the onset of clinical symptoms. The co-ordinated regulation of HSP70 and HSP90 makes these 
13 
chaperones interesting therapeutic targets. Indeed, HSP90 inhibitors have been shown to prevent 
14 
aggregation and toxicity of many aggregates in cells and mice, including p53, a-synuclein, tau and 
15 
huntingtin53,144-147, probably reflecting consequences of HSP90 inhibition as well as HSP70 activation.  
16 
Several chaperones have been shown to be upregulated in PrD patients, including GRP78 and GRP58 
17 
(ref 148,149). GRP78 (also known as BiP or HSP5A) prevents the aggregation of misfolded proteins in 
18 
the ER, including PrP and Ab, and targets protein aggregates for proteasomal degradation112,150. 
19 
Accordingly, GRP78 overexpression reduces prion replication, and GRP78 reduction leads to increased 
20 
prion replication and accelerated PrD progression151. Similar results have been reported for GRP58 
21 
(also termed ERp57) with its overexpression conferring neuroprotection and its downregulation leading 
22 
to increased prion induced toxicity152.  
23 
Another chaperone of interest with respect to protein aggregation is the yeast chaperone Hsp104, a prion 
24 
disaggregase that acts together with Hsp70 and Hsp40 to release correctly folded proteins from 
25 
aggregates153. Yeast prions are highly sensitive to the levels of Hsp104; low levels of Hsp104 promote 
26 
oligomer formation, oligomerization is prevented at high Hsp104 concentrations154, and loss of Hsp104 
27 
 Page | 17 
 
eliminates prions155. To date, a homologous disaggregase has not been identified in metazoans.

 [H1] TREATING PROTEIN MISFOLDING DISORDERS 
3 
Several different compounds have been used to fight protein aggregation disorders (Figure 3). While 
4 
some reagents are designed to interfere with the aggregation process, others eliminate or even 
5 
hyperstabilize the aggregates. Here we outline some approaches relevant to the treatment of PrDs and 
6 
other protein aggregation disorders. A more comprehensive discussion of therapeutic principles can be 
7 
found in a recent review156. 
8 
[H2] Inhibition of protein aggregation. The findings that p53 is a prionoid and that p53 aggregation 
9 
plays a crucial role in some cancers157 opens up the potential for novel therapeutic strategies that 
10 
specifically interfere with p53 aggregation (Figure 3A). The chaperone complex HSP90/HDAC6 has 
11 
been shown to be upregulated in cancer cells and to stabilize p53 aggregates158. Interestingly, currently 
12 
approved HSP90 inhibitors reduced tumor growth and extended survival time in mice expressing an 
13 
aggregation-prone version of p53, while mice deficient for p53 were unaffected by HSP90 inhibitor 
14 
treatment53. Furthermore, a peptide that binds the amyloid adhesive segment of p53 prevents p53 
15 
aggregation, restores p53 function, and induces cell death and tumor regression in mice159. The course 
16 
of cancer treatment should thus not only be dependent on the identity of a mutated gene, but should also 
17 
take the type of mutation into account. HSP90 inhibitors have also been applied to mouse models of 
18 
neuronal PMDs. While effective in preventing a-synuclein, Ab, tau and Huntingtin aggregation and 
19 
toxicity, long-term relief of disease symptoms has proven to be challenging144-147,160,161. Recently, 
20 
HSP90 inhibition was observed to provide synaptic protection in a mouse AD model160, suggesting that 
21 
chaperone modulation might indeed be a promising therapeutic approach for neuronal PMDs in the 
22 
future.  
23 
 
24 
[H2] Depletion of substrates with anti-prions. An orthogonal approach to interfere with protein 
25 
aggregation is the design of anti-prions. Anti-prions are innocuous PrP aggregates that, upon injection, 
26 
can compete with prions for the same substrate, PrPC, thereby reducing prion replication (Figure 3B). 
27 
 Page | 18 
 
Anti-prions delay the onset of clinical symptoms in prion-injected hamsters and prevent disease 
1 
manifestation in animals exposed to low quantities of prions. Interestingly, a single dose of anti-prion 
2 
reduced prion infectivity by 99%, making anti-prions an interesting candidate for therapy162. Most 
3 
therapeutics are rapidly metabolized, consumed or degraded and therefore need to be administered on 
4 
a regular basis. By contrast, anti-prions self-replicate and are therefore self-sustaining until their source, 
5 
PrPC, is depleted. Anti-prions are therefore also tantalizing therapeutics for other neurodegenerative 
6 
PMDs. While it is possible that the depletion of the substrate might cause deleterious effects, these may 
7 
be limited and tolerable. For instance, mice lacking PrPC suffer from relatively mild phenotypes23, and 
8 
mice without a–synuclein display no gross morphological or behavioral abnormalities163. However, 
9 
mice lacking Ab showed impaired neuronal function164. Thus, the pros and cons of substrate depletion 
10 
versus inhibition of aggregation will be different for each PMD and will require careful consideration.  
11 
 
12 
[H2] Stabilization of protein aggregates. The most important stage in the replicative cycle of a prion 
13 
is arguably the fragmentation of an aggregate into two or more propagons, as this is the process by 
14 
which prions multiply. Indeed, theoretical models have predicted, and studies in experimental models 
15 
have validated, that the frangibility of amyloid fibrils is the most important parameter governing the 
16 
rate of replication of prions6. Thus, any therapeutic strategy based on ‘beta sheet breakers’165, which are 
17 
homologous peptides that are unable to adopt higher-order structures, might increase rather than reduce 
18 
the number of prions. A promising alternative approach is to instead hyperstabilize aggregates to 
19 
prevent their fragmentation and replication (Figure 3C). Luminescent conjugated polythiophenes 
20 
(LCPs) bind to a variety of amyloids166, and have also been shown to bind and stabilize prions167. LCPs 
21 
optimized for prion binding were efficacious against multiple prions strains168 and could extend the 
22 
lifespan of prion-exposed mice by up to 80%169. LCPs are well tolerated in mice and can cross the 
23 
blood-brain-barrier, which, together with their high affinity for many amyloids, make them interesting 
24 
candidates for therapeutic development. 
25 
 
26 
[H2] Antibodies. Antibodies are currently considered to be promising therapeutics for the treatment of 
27 
 Page | 19 
 
protein aggregation disorders. By specifically targeting complex and often conformation-dependent 
1 
antigens, antibodies are thought to have fewer off-target effects than traditional small-molecule 
2 
therapeutics. An increasing number of human-derived antibodies are entering clinical trials for various 
3 
diseases, and are thought to have a better safety profile than their “humanized” counterparts170.  
4 
In the case of protein aggregation disorders, it is conceivable that antibodies exert protective effects 
5 
through multiple different mechanisms (Figure 3D). For instance, antibodies can bind to monomeric or 
6 
aggregated proteins thereby making the substrate unavailable for conversion into aggregates171 and/or 
7 
sterically interfering with the aggregation process itself. Certain prion antibodies have been suggested 
8 
to act by a different mechanism, which involves targeting a part of the prion protein that is required for 
9 
exerting toxicity; in this case, antibodies engaging the flexible tail can counteract prion-induced 
10 
toxicity. While the antibody does not reduce infectivity, it interferes with downstream events triggered 
11 
by prions and prevents them from inducing neurodegeneration79. Finally, antibodies can specifically 
12 
bind to and neutralize aggregates, resulting in more efficient clearance of toxic species from affected 
13 
tissues, for instance by phagocytic cells172-174. Indeed, research into AD therapeutics focuses on 
14 
antibodies that specifically detect and eliminate amyloid deposits. One promising AD drug currently 
15 
undergoing clinical trials, aducanumab, is an antibody isolated from a human centenarian who showed 
16 
no signs of cognitive impairment. It was speculated that this donor individual may have developed 
17 
antibodies against aggregated Aβ, which safeguarded against dementia. Aducanumab targets and 
18 
reduces aggregated Ab in a dose- and time-dependent manner similarly to previously investigated 
19 
antibodies but, in contrast to other antibodies, it appears to slow the rate of clinical decline175. However, 
20 
this study must be viewed in context: there is currently no population-based evidence that spontaneous 
21 
immunity against Aβ exists in humans and is protective against AD. Furthermore, as stated above, 
22 
certain PrP antibodies are toxic, suggesting that caution should be exercised in clinical trials of 
23 
immunotherapies. Nonetheless, in our view, the prospects of immunotherapy for the treatment of 
24 
neurodegenerative diseases remain promising.  
25 
It is also important to note that a reduction of Ab aggregates does not necessarily impact the clinical 
26 
progression of AD, as powerfully demonstrated by the failure of numerous clinical trials despite 
27 
 Page | 20 
 
convincing pharmacodynamics176. Furthermore, the deposition of Ab aggregates has been observed in 
1 
individuals without dementia177 and is thought to occur decades before the onset of clinical symptoms 
2 
of AD, which seems to correlate with neurodegeneration rather than amyloid deposition178. One likely 
3 
explanation for the failure of many AD trials might therefore lie within the trial design and not the 
4 
efficacy of the tested compound. Many patients display clinical symptoms at the time of enrolment, a 
5 
stage where amyloid deposits might have already induced irreversible toxicity. With the development 
6 
of novel technologies and the identification of new biomarkers, the early diagnosis and enrolment of 
7 
preclinical AD patients has become possible, and will hopefully yield promising outcomes for 
8 
upcoming clinical trials. The difficulty of correctly diagnosing AD, combined with the high prevalence 
9 
of the disease (more than 9% of individuals older than 65), raises the question whether AD therapeutics 
10 
should be administered prophylactically in the future. 
11 
 
12 
[H1] CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE PERSPECTIVES 
13 
To date, fortunately neither AD nor PD nor any other protein aggregation disease are known to have 
14 
caused a human epidemic such as kuru and vCJD. However, the prevalence of these diseases is high 
15 
and their causes are still largely unknown, which complicates the detection of infectious aggregates that 
16 
can spread between individuals. Nevertheless, from a medical perspective, PrDs currently still stand 
17 
out as infectious diseases with many similarities to viral encephalopathies; they are therefore profoundly 
18 
distinct from all other neurodegenerative diseases despite their similarities in molecular pathogenesis. 
19 
Using its original definition as an infectious protein-, no protein aggregate other than PrPSc can currently 
20 
be called a prion. It is possible that some of the proteins that currently qualify as prionoids - in particular, 
21 
the aggregated forms of synuclein179 and AA amyloid180 - may have to be reclassified as true prions if 
22 
they are shown to be infectious.  
23 
Several orthogonal therapeutic strategies have been undertaken to combat protein aggregation and its 
24 
corresponding diseases. Many of these therapies have shown promise in vitro and in mice, but it remains 
25 
to be determined if these results hold up in human studies. Indeed, clinical trials for protein aggregation 
26 
disorders have, with few exceptions, yielded vastly disappointing results176. However, our knowledge 
27 
 Page | 21 
 
of these diseases has increased tremendously over the past decades. Research on PrDs has historically 
1 
led the field of PMDs and the mouse model for PrD has been shown to recapitulate transcriptome-wide 
2 
changes in human patients more faithfully than other neurodegenerative disease models181. Studies on 
3 
prions are therefore likely to continue to drive our understanding of aggregation-induced toxicity. 
4 
Several similarities between different protein aggregates have been identified, and different aggregates 
5 
seem to exert toxicity, at least partly, by the same pathways. All of which suggests that insights gained 
6 
on one of these disorders may be valid for other protein aggregation disorders. These findings, 
7 
combined with the development of novel technologies, may allow the development of effective 
8 
treatments for PMDs in the future.

Box 1 | Diagnosing prion diseases 
21 
The transmissible nature of prion diseases (PrDs) and the resulting danger of contracting the disease 
22 
iatrogenically make their correct diagnosis a pressing need for patients, their families and society. 
23 
Historically, PrDs have been diagnosed based on their clinical symptoms and by excluding other 
24 
diseases. 
Diagnosis 
is 
further 
supported 
by 
magnetic 
resonance 
imaging 
(MRI), 
25 
electroencephalography (EEG), and the detection of surrogate markers in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). 
26 
While diffusion patterns on MRI, periodic sharp and slow wave complexes on EEG and an upregulation 
27 
of CSF markers such as 14-3-3 correlate with PrD, these assays usually simply indicate neuronal 
28 
damage and even a combination of them is vastly insufficient for providing the sensitive and specific 
29 
 Page | 31 
 
results required182.  
1 
A definitive diagnosis of PrD requires the detection of protease-resistant prion deposits. However, prion 
2 
deposits are most prominent in the brain and their ante-mortem detection without a brain biopsy has 
3 
proven to be a major challenge. Conventional immunoblotting and ELISA techniques are usually not 
4 
sensitive enough to detect the minute amounts of prions in more accessible patient samples, such as 
5 
blood. The detection of misfolded PrP is further complicated by the excess of normal PrPC in blood, 
6 
and even the development of an ultrasensitive ELISA involving enrichment of aggregated PrP using

steel powder only enabled the diagnosis of vCJD but not other types of PrDs183,184. Thus, the definitive 
8 
diagnosis of PrD currently still depends on the analysis of brain samples, which, with a few exceptions 
9 
involving brain biopsies, occurs postmortem. The presence of prion deposits can then be detected via 
10 
immunoblotting or immunohistochemistry, and neuropathological changes such as gliosis, neuronal 
11 
loss and spongiform changes can be visualized using immunohistochemistry.  
12 
Recently developed approaches have therefore concentrated on increasing the sensitivity of diagnostic 
13 
tests by amplifying aggregates before detection. Protein misfolding cyclic amplification (PMCA)185, 
14 
the amyloid seeding assay (ASA)186, and quaking-induced conversion (QuIC)187 have been applied to 
15 
verify the presence of minute amounts of prions in infected specimen from animals and human. The 
16 
further development of the real-time QUIC (RT-QUIC) assay allowed the assessment of human CSF 
17 
samples188, and has now reached 96% sensitivity189 and 100% specificity188 in diagnosing CJD. Lately, 
18 
the PMCA assay has been adapted for blood-based diagnosis of vCJD190,191; however, further studies 
19 
are needed to validate this assay, especially regarding its application to other PrDs.

Box 2 | Protein-misfolding disorders affecting the nervous system  
22 
Neurodegenerative disorders have been linked to a variety of different protein aggregates and thus 
23 
belong to the broader category of protein-misfolding disorders (PMDs). PMD-implicated proteins 
24 
include APP, a-synuclein, C9orf72, FUS, Huntingtin, Tau, TDP-43, and PrPC. Triggers such as stress, 
25 
age, or mutagenesis are thought to induce misfolding of these proteins into toxic oligomeric species142. 
26 
Different diseases, even though sometimes caused by aggregates of the same protein, show a spectrum 
27 
 Page | 32 
 
of neuropathological and clinical symptoms, indicating the presence of multiple aggregate strains that 
1 
exert toxicity in distinct manners. With the exception of multiple system atrophy (MSA), which affects 
2 
primarily oligodendrocytes, protein aggregates are usually most toxic to neurons. Synaptic defects seem 
3 
to be an early event in neuronal PMDs and have been shown to cause neurodegeneration. Moreover, 
4 
specific neuronal subtypes in different brain regions show a selective vulnerability to the different 
5 
aggregates129,192,193. This suggests that the expression of co-factors such as receptors or chaperones can 
6 
modulate the aggregate-induced toxicity and highlights the importance of cell-type specific future 
7 
studies to decipher the differential vulnerability. The scheme below illustrates which protein aggregates 
8 
cause which neuropathological (P) and clinical (C) changes and the associated PMD.

Figure 1 | The nucleation and fragmentation cycle of prions and prionoids. Chaperones linked to 
11 
protein synthesis (CLIPs) guide and oversee the correct folding of newly synthesized polypeptide 
12 
chains142. Misfolded proteins, induced by triggers such as overexpression, mutations, stress or age, 
13 
either re-fold with the help of heat-shock proteins (HSPs), undergo degradation, or aggregate into b-
14 
sheet rich oligomers, which are considered the most toxic aggregate species. Endoplasmic reticulum 
15 
associated protein degradation (ERAD)107,110 or HSP70-mediated ubiquitination target misfolded 
16 
monomeric and oligomeric aggregates for proteasomal degradation. By contrast, HSP90 stabilizes 
17 
oligomers142, which can then form higher-order structures such as protofibrils or fibrils by incorporating 
18 
correctly folded and misfolded monomeric proteins. The fragmentation of higher-order structures 
19 
produces new propagons that can re-initiate the nucleation-fragmentation cycle.

Figure 3 | Therapeutic approaches targeting protein aggregation.  
10 
Several different approaches have been undertaken to develop therapeutics for PMDs and show 
11 
promising results in animal models. a. Overexpression of HSP70 and inhibition of HSP90 increases the 
12 
degradation of misfolded proteins..  
13 
b. Anti-prions, innocuous versions of PrPSc, compete with the aggregates for the same substrate and 
14 
result in the formation of novel innocuous aggregates . 
15 
c. Luminescent conjugated polythiophenes (LCPs) hyperstabilize aggregates, thereby interfering with 
16 
the nucleation-fragmentation cycle and consequently reduce aggregate propagation.  
17 
d. Antibodies specifically recognize and bind aggregates and can lead to aggregate clearance via 
18 
phagocytic cells, interfere with the aggregation process, or prevent aggregates from exerting toxicity.

2 
PRION DISEASES  
3 
 (PrDs) A group of diseases caused by an infectious protein, which includes genetic, acquired and sporadic forms 
4 
.PrDs have an overall incidence of 1-2 cases per million individuals per year. 
5 
 
6 
PRION 
7 
The agent causing transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSE). As originally defined, the term does not 
8 
have structural implications other than that a protein is an essential component. Although it is now generally 
9 
accepted that the prion consists largely of PrPSc, prions are defined as a biological activity rather than a physical 
10 
entity. Hence they can be measured by activity assays rather than by quantitating PrPSc.  
11 
 
12 
AGGREGATES 
13 
In the context of this review, the term “aggregate” is used to denote the coalescence of misfolded proteins into 
14 
highly ordered structures, typically resulting in the formation of fibrils.  
15 
 
16 
PROTEIN MISFOLDING DISORDERS  
17 
(PMDs) Disorders that are characterized by protein aggregates, which induce neurodegeneration if present in the 
18 
brain.  
19 
 
20 
PROPAGON 
21 
The minimal propagating unit of a misfolded protein, defined by its capacity to self-replicate in vitro and/or in 
22 
vivo. A propagon that can transmit from a host individual to another individual is called a prion.  
23 
 
24 
PRIONOIDS 
25 
Protein aggregates that can propagate and spread between cells, but for which transmissibility between individuals 
26 
has not yet been demonstrated.  
27 
 
28 
POLYMORPHISMS 
29 
Any sites in the DNA sequence that are present in the population in more than one state. 
30 
 
31 
PENETRANCE 
32 
the percentage of individuals with a mutation that exhibit clinical symptoms. Most PRNP mutations are highly 
33 
penetrant, meaning that most individuals with PRNP mutations develop PrD.  
34 
 
35 
PRION STRAINS 
36 
Entities associated with distinct biochemical and neuropathological profiles, translating into a spectrum of 
37 
incubation periods and clinical signs. Crucially, strain-specific traits are stable across serial transmission among 
38 
isogenic hosts, indicating that they are encoded by the prion itself. Distinct structural assemblies of chemically 
39 
identical PrPSc are thought to underlie strainness. 
40 
 
41 
PHASE DEMIXING 
42 
Process of membraneless compartmentalization. Spontaneous demixing of two coexisting phases is driven by 
43 
inter-molecular interactions, a propensity that seems to be particularly high for proteins with low-complexity 
44 
domains. 
45 
 
46 
EXCITOTOXICITY 
47 
Neuronal overstimulation caused by increased levels of the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate leading to 
48 
calcium overload and mitochondrial dysfunction, and ultimately to neuronal cell death and memory loss.  
49 
 
50 
PARABIOSIS 
51 
Surgical technique to anatomically connect two indivuals. The shared circulatory system between the individuals 
52 
allows specific factors to be assessed for their involvement in regulating physiological functions, behavior, and 
53 
disease pathogenesis.

ToC blurb 
13 
Parallels are increasingly being drawn between prion diseases and other aggregate-mediated 
14 
neurodegenerative disorders. While prion diseases are a distinct subclass of protein misfolding disorders 
15 
(PMDs), a better understanding of shared mechanisms is likely to benefit treatment of all PMDs.
