abstract
OBJECTIVE: The prospective relation between physical activity and Diagnostic and Statistical 
Manual of Mental Disorders-defined major depression in middle childhood is unknown, 
as is the stability of depression. We therefore aimed to (1) determine whether there are 
reciprocal relations between moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) and sedentary 
behavior, on one hand, and Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth 
Edition defined symptoms of major depressive disorder, on the other and (2) assess the 
extent of stability in depressive symptoms from age 6 to 10 years.
METHODS: A community sample of children living in Trondheim, Norway, comprising a total 
of 795 6-year-old children was followed up at 8 (n = 699) and 10 (n = 702) years of age. 
Physical activity was recorded by accelerometry and symptoms of major depression were 
measured through semistructured clinical interviews of parents and children. Bidirectional 
relationships between MVPA, sedentary activity, and symptoms of depression were 
analyzed through autoregressive cross-lagged models, and adjusted for symptoms of 
comorbid psychiatric disorders and BMI.
RESULTS: At both age 6 and 8 years, higher MVPA predicted fewer symptoms of major 
depressive disorders 2 years later. Sedentary behavior did not predict depression, and 
depression predicted neither MVPA nor sedentary activity. The number of symptoms of 
major depression declined from ages 6 to 8 years and evidenced modest continuity.
CONCLUSIONS: MVPA predicts fewer symptoms of major depression in middle childhood, and 
increasing MVPA may serve as a complementary method to prevent and treat childhood 
depression.

WHAT’S KNOWN ON THIS SUBJECT: Moderate-
to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) reduces the 
likelihood of depression in adolescents and adults, 
and is cross-sectionally associated with depression 
in children. However, the prospective relation 
between MVPA, sedentary time, and depression in 
childhood is unknown.
WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: Objectively measured 
MVPA at ages 6 and 8 predict fewer symptoms 
of depression in children 2 years later, whereas 
sedentary activity is prospectively unrelated to 
depression. Depression does not forecast reduced 
physical activity in children.

Both observational and treatment 
studies 
1 
– 
3 indicate that physical 
activity (PA)—and moderate-to-
vigorous PA (MVPA), in particular—
may reduce the likelihood of major 
depressive disorder (MDD) and/or 
reduce the symptoms of MDD 
in adolescents 
4 and adults.5 
– 
7 It 
has recently become increasingly 
clear that depression can also 
be present in young children. 
8, 
 
9 
Preventive10 and treatment efforts 
11 
for childhood depression are only 
modestly effective, which suggests 
that alternative or complementary 
interventions must be sought. 
MVPA might possibly serve as a 
strategy for preventing or reducing 
childhood depression. Indeed, a 
meta-analysis of randomized and 
quasiexperimental studies 
12 among 
children in late childhood and early 
adolescence suggested a small short-
term effect of PA interventions. 
Given the waxing and waning of 
depression, 
 
13 it is important also to 
discern whether long-term effects are 
present. Toward this end, prospective 
community studies might prove 
valuable. Importantly, psychomotor 
retardation is 1 symptom of MDD, 
 
14 
and depressed children show 
higher levels of motor inactivity 
than controls, 
6, 
 
15 which might 
explain the association reported. 
Longitudinal studies are therefore 
needed to reveal whether depression 
predicts reduced PA and whether 
reduced PA increases the risk for 
depression in children, as has been 
shown in adolescents and adults. 
5, 
 
6, 
 
16 
Moreover, to our knowledge, no 
longitudinal study has examined 
the relationship between PA and 
depression in middle childhood by 
using a community based sample.
To identify the potentially beneficial 
effects of PA on depression (and vice 
versa) in nonreferred children, we 
examine the bidirectional relation 
between MVPA and symptoms 
of depression, while addressing 
several important methodological 
issues. First, previous observational 
studies have nearly exclusively 
measured depression by means 
of rating scales; however, the 
correspondence between rating 
scale scores and the results from 
clinical diagnostic interviews are 
only moderate. 
17 Second, studies 
of the PA-depression relationship 
in children and adolescents have 
mainly used indirect methods to 
measure children’s PA (ie, parent 
report or self-report, which are 
only moderately associated with 
objectively measured PA); in 
fact, PA in community children 
may be overestimated by using 
indirect methods. 
18 Hence, to avoid 
confounding due to reporting bias, 
the PA–depression relationship 
should be investigated by using 
objective measures of PA. Third, 
sedentary activity and MVPA are 
negatively, but far from perfectly, 
correlated. 
19 In other words, some 
children may be periodically highly 
active but may nonetheless spend 
much time engaged in sedentary 
behavior. A substantial amount of 
research has focused on MVPA; 
however, several studies have 
revealed that sedentary behavior, 
not necessarily MVPA, might predict 
depression. 
20, 
21 Thus, we will 
investigate the extent to which time 
spent in sedentary activities predicts 
symptoms of MDD over and above 
the effects of MVPA. Fourth, there is 
considerable comorbidity between 
depression and other psychiatric 
disorders in children, 
 
22, 
 
23 and 
these disorders might be related to 
PA, confounding the relationship 
between depression and PA as a 
result. Fifth, although the evidence is 
mixed, 
 
24 a bidirectional relationship 
between childhood depression 
and BMI is indicated, 
 
25 and BMI 
should therefore be controlled for. 
To overcome these obstacles, we 
investigate the prospective reciprocal 
relations between Diagnostic and 
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 
Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) defined 
symptoms of major depression 
(obtained by using diagnostic 
interviews) and accelerometry-
recorded MVPA and sedentary 
activity in a large community sample 
of Norwegian children monitored 
biannually from the ages of 6 to 10 
years controlling for BMI and other 
psychiatric symptoms.
METHODS
Participants, Recruitment, and 
Procedure
The Trondheim Early Secure 
Study consists of children from 
the 2003 and 2004 birth cohorts 
in Trondheim, Norway (n = 3456) 
that were recruited by invitation 
letter, together with the Strengths 
and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) 
4–16 version. 
26 Written consent 
to participate was obtained when 
attending ordinary community health 
checkups for their 4-year-olds and 
the completed SDQ was delivered. As 
can be seen in  
Fig 1, the vast majority 
(n = 3358, 97.2%) of children who 
were invited to participate appeared 
at the city’s well-child clinics. The 
SDQ total problem scores (20 items) 
were divided into 4 strata (cutoffs: 
0 to 4, 5 to 8, 9 to 11, and 12 to 
40), where drawing probabilities 
increased with increasing SDQ 
scores (0.37, 0.48, 0.70, and 0.89 
in the 4 strata) to increase sample 
variability. The PA measurements 
were included beginning with the 
second wave of the data collection 
(6 years) and onward; therefore, the 
data used in the present inquiry were 
taken from 6-year (2009 to 2011, 
n = 795), 8-year (2011 to 2013, n = 
699), and 10-year (2013 to 2015, 
n = 702) assessments. In all, 799 
children had usable data from at least 
1 measurement, and thus constitute 
the analytical sample. Attrition was 
not selective according to the study 
variables, except that more hours 
in MVPA at age 8 predicted attrition 
at age 10 (odds ratio = 2.38; 95% 
confidence interval [CI]: 1.22 to 4.83, 
P = .01); a bias that was adjusted 
for in the analyses (see Statistical

Analysis). The study was approved 
by the Regional Committee of 
Medical and Health Research Ethics, 
Mid-Norway.
Measurements
Physical Activity
The children were instructed to wear 
an ActiGraph GT3X accelerometer 
(Manufacturing Technology, Inc, 
Fort Walton Beach, FL) around their 
waist for 7 consecutive days, 24 
hours a day, and only remove it 
when bathing or showering. Only 
daytime activity (06:00–23:59) was 
included. Sequences of consecutive 
zero counts lasting ≥20 minutes 
were interpreted as nonwear time. 
27, 
 
28 
Only those participants with ≥3 
days of recordings and ≥480 
minutes of activity per day were 
included. Detailed information on 
accelerometer compliance is shown 
in Supplemental Table 3. Because 
young children’s activity is often 
intermittent with short bursts, we 
employed the commonly used 10 
seconds epoch length. 
27 We applied 
the Evenson et al 
29 cutoff point of 
≥2296 cpm for MVPA because it 
has shown superior classification 
ability in children across the ages 
relevant to the current study.30 
Minutes per day with ≤100 cpm 
was considered sedentary activity, 
a cutoff that is widely used and has 
excellent classification accuracy. 
30 In 
the analyses, MVPA and sedentary 
activity were represented in 
hours per day intervals. Data were 
processed by using accelerometer 
analysis software (ActiGraph LLC, 
Pensacola, FL).
Symptoms of MDD
The Preschool Age Psychiatric 
Assessment (PAPA), 
 
31 a psychiatric 
interview completed by parents using 
a structured protocol, with both 
mandatory and optional follow-up 
questions, was used to assess MDD 
symptoms at 6 years. A sum score 
of DSM-IV defined MDD symptoms 
constituted the outcome. At 8 and 10 
years of age, the Child and Adolescent 
Psychiatric Assessment (CAPA) 
32 
was used. Both parents and children 
were interviewed and a symptom 
was considered to be present if it was 
reported by either child or parent. 
The PAPA and CAPA interviewers 
(n = 9) had at least a Bachelor’s 
degree in a relevant field and were 
instructed by the developers of the 
PAPA and CAPA. For the PAPA, 9% 
of the interview audio recordings 
were recoded by blinded raters, as 
were 15% of the CAPA interviews. 
The interrater reliability between 
multiple pairs of raters was 0.90 for 
symptoms of MDD in the PAPA and 
0.83 in the CAPA.
Symptoms of Other Psychiatric 
Disorders
Symptoms of anxiety (consisting 
of number of symptoms of social 
phobia, separation anxiety, 
generalized anxiety, and specific 
phobias), attention-deficit/
hyperactivity (ADHD), oppositional 
defiant (ODD), and conduct disorders 
(CDs) were assessed following the 
same procedures as for symptoms 
of MDD. Only the parents were 
interviewed by using the CAPA with 
respect to ADHD. The interrater 
reliabilities for PAPA/CAPA ranged 
from 0.85 to 0.97.
Body Mass Index
The children’s weight was measured 
by using a digital scale (Tanita 
BC20MA), and the height was 
assessed by using the Heightronic 
3

Digital Stadiometer (QuickMedical 
Model 235A). Correction for indoor 
clothing (0.5 kg) was applied. BMI 
was calculated as kg/m2.
Statistical Analysis
Reciprocal relations between PA 
and the symptoms of MDD were 
examined in Mplus 7.31, 
 
33 using 
autoregressive cross-lagged analysis 
within a structural equation 
framework. The symptoms of MDD, 
MVPA, and sedentary activity at age 
10 were regressed on measures 
of these variables and covariates 
at age 8, whereas age 8 measures 
were regressed on measures at age 
6, as shown in  
Fig 2. To allow for 
sleeper effects (ie, the effects from 
age 6 to age 10 measures bypassing 
measures at age 8), autocorrelated 
paths were allowed from ages 6 to 
10. Measures obtained at the same 
time point in time (ie, at ages 6, 8, 
and 10, respectively) were allowed 
to correlate. To examine overall 
changes in level of MDD, sedentary 
activity and MVPA latent growth 
curve analyses were conducted. 
Because the attrition analyses 
indicated that the data were missing 
not at random (MNAR), missing 
data were handled according 
to a full information maximum 
likelihood procedure. Because 
counts of depressive symptoms are 
right skewed, 
 
34 a robust maximum 
likelihood estimator was used, which 
is robust to moderate deviations 
from normality. As oversampling was 
applied on the basis of mental health 
problems, the data were weighted 
back with a factor determined 
as the number of children in the 
population in each stratum divided 
by the number of participants in 
each stratum to arrive at correct 
population estimates. To examine 
gender differences in the estimates, a 
Wald test was employed to compare 
the fit of 2 models, one in which the 
path at hand was fixed as identical for 
the 2 genders and the other in which 
the path was freely estimated. 
26
RESULTS
The descriptive statistics are shown 
in  
Table 1. The rate of DSM-IV defined 
MDD diagnosis, ranged from 0.3% 
(age 6) to 0.4% (age 8), underscoring 
the need, at this age, to analyze MDD 
continuously as symptom counts. 
Supplementary piecewise growth 
curve analyses revealed that MDD 
decreased from ages 6 to 8 years 
(Mgrowth= −0.13 [95% CI, −0.17 to 
−0.10]) but increased from ages 8 
to 10 years (Mgrowth= 0.03 [95% CI, 
0.00 to 0.06]). Minutes of MVPA per 
day did not change from ages 6 to 8 
years (Mgrowth= −0.17 [95% CI, −1.35 
to 1.01]) but decreased from ages 8 
to 10 years (Mgrowth= −2.62 [95% CI, 
−3.75 to −1.49]). Finally, sedentary 
activity increased from ages 6 to 8 
years (Mgrowth= 0.32 [95% CI, 0.27 
to 0.37]) and increased further from 
ages 8 to 10 years (Mgrowth= 0.36 
[95% CI, 0.30 to 0.42]). Regarding 
rank order stability,  
Table 2 shows 
that the symptoms for MDD and 
sedentary activity were modestly 
stable, whereas we found higher 
stability for MVPA.
Cross-Sectional Findings
The symptoms of MDD were 
negatively correlated with MVPA at 
ages 8 and 10, but were unrelated 
to sedentary activity ( 
Table 2). As 
expected, the symptoms of MDD 
covaried with the symptoms of other 
disorders at all time points. The 
symptoms of these other disorders 
were generally unrelated to MVPA

the model illustration, as are the autoregressive paths from 6 to 10 years.

and sedentary activity, although we 
found higher MVPA among 6-year-old 
children who had more symptoms of 
anxiety disorders and less sedentary 
activity among those 6-year-old 
children who had elevated symptoms 
of ADHD.
Prospective Associations
The main results from the 
autoregressive cross-lagged 
model examining the bidirectional 
relationships between MVPA, 
sedentary activity, and major 
depression are shown in  
Fig 2. 
For complete model results, see 
Supplemental Table 4.
The model did fit the data well (χ2 = 
21.76, df = 24, P = .59, comparative 
fit index = 1.00, Tucker-Lewis index = 
1.007, root mean square error of 
approximation = 0.000). At both 6 
and 8 years, higher levels of MVPA 
predicted fewer symptoms of MDD 2 
years later. The reduction was ∼0.20 
symptoms of depression per daily 
hour spent in MVPA. The effect of 
MVPA on depression from age 8 to 
10 was seemingly stronger than the 
effect from age 6 to 8. Standardized 
coefficients revealed effect sizes of β 
−0.08 (at age 6 to 8) and β −0.11 at 
age 8 to 10), respectively. However, 
when comparing a model in which 
these 2 path coefficients were fixed 
as equal with a model in which they 
were freely estimated, no significant 
difference was found (Wald = 0.41, 
df = 1, P = .41). A similar procedure 
was used to test for the gender-
specific effects of MVPA on later 
symptoms of MDD, and no such 
differences were found (6 to 8 years: 
Wald = 0.47, df = 1, P = .49; 8 to 10 
years: Wald = 0.34, df = 1, P = .56). 
Because MDD symptoms are heavily 
right-skewed with many children 
evincing no symptoms and just a 
few evincing many symptoms, there 
is a possibility that the obtained 
effect of MVPA on MDD was due to 
skewness and count nature of MDD 
symptoms. We therefore run the path 
analysis treating MDD symptoms as

having a negative binominal (count) 
distribution. MVPA still predicted 
reduced numbers of MDD symptoms 
from age 6 to 8 (B = −0.58 [95% 
CI: −0.95 to −0.21], P = .001) and 
from age 8 to 10 (B = −0.58 [95% CI: 
−1.03 to −0.13], P = .002). Moreover, 
depression did not predict later 
MVPA, and no effects of sedentary 
activity on depression, or vice versa, 
were detected.
DISCUSSION
To aid the preventive and treatment 
efforts of depression among children, 
we examined the bidirectional 
relations between MVPA, sedentary 
activity, and MDD symptoms over 
3 waves of data collection in a large 
community sample of children. 
Higher levels of MVPA at 6 and 8, 
respectively, predicted fewer MDD 
symptoms 2 years later. No effects of 
sedentary activity were found for MDD 
symptoms, and MDD symptoms did 
not predict later PA (or lack thereof).
MVPA Predicts Fewer Depressive 
Symptoms
The identified effects of PA on 
depression extend findings from 
observational studies of adolescents 
and adults 
35 by documenting that 
this relationship is also present in 
middle childhood. We further add 
to existing knowledge by showing 
that predictive effects are present 
when we examine interview-based 
DSM-defined symptoms of MDD 
rather than questionnaires, and 
when applying objectively measured 
PA, and account for the potential 
effects of other psychiatric disorders 
and BMI. Although the effects of 
MVPA were small, they are similar 
to those obtained by psychosocial 
intervention programs in children 
36 
and adolescents. 
37 Along with the 
fact that nearly all children can be 
targeted in efforts to increase MVPA, 
the gains at the population level 
might be substantial.
Although the current study did not 
address why PA may reduce future 
symptoms of MDD, 2 potential 
mechanisms related to PA’s 2 not 
mutually exclusive components 
(the activity and the physical 
components), can be hypothesized. 
Treatment studies applying activity 
scheduling have indicated that 
increasing activity, not necessarily 
just PA, may reduce depression. 
38 
Several explanations for this MDD-
reducing effect have been proposed: 
(1) Engaging in activities may distract 
from ruminating over negative 
events, and ruminations may worsen 
or prolong depression. 
39, 
 
40 (2) A 
substantial part of MVPA in children 
consists of play or sports activities, 
 
41 
and playing or engaging in sports 
may bolster self-efficacy and self-
esteem in children, which has been 
suggested to prevent depression.42, 
 
43 
(3) Finally, when children are 
physically active, they tend to be 
with other children. 
41 Although peer-
rejections and bullying also occur in 
sports, 
 
44 physically active children 
may be more socially integrated in 
peer groups than less active children. 
Such peer acceptance, which is 
likely to result in social support, is a 
potential buffer against depression. 
45
Regarding the physical component 
of PA, several physiologic and 
biochemical mechanisms have been 
proposed, such as the demonstration 
of PA leading to higher availability of 
neurotransmitters, which is assumed 
to have antidepressant effects. 
46, 
 
47 In 
addition, regular PA has a favorable 
impact on neuronal functions and 
structure along with increased 
cognitive functions. 
48
No Prospective Relation Between 
Sedentary Activity and Symptoms of 
MDD
Our study is the first to objectively 
examine sedentary activity and 
later depression in early and 
middle childhood, and we find 
no prospective relation between 
sedentary behavior and symptoms 
of MDD. Although there are some 
important exceptions, 
 
49 research on 
adolescents and adults has suggested 
that sedentary behavior may increase 
depression. 
20 It is thus likely that the 
effect of sedentariness on depression 
is age-dependent. However, because 
psychomotor retardation and loss 
of energy are among the symptoms 
of MDD, it is essential to adjust for 
previous MDD when examining 
sedentary activity’s contribution to 
MDD, which has been investigated 
only to a limited extent. 
21, 
 
49 Further, 
in many of these prospective 
studies, self-reports of inactivity 
and depression have been applied 
that may inflate their relationship 
on a prospective basis, due to the 
common methods that are employed. 
Moreover, it is essential to adjust 
for lack of MVPA when estimating 
the effects of sedentariness because 
MVPA and sedentary activity are 
negatively correlated. In sum, the lack 
of comparable studies underscores 
the need to replicate our findings.
Levels of PA and Symptoms of MDD 
During Middle Childhood
The level of symptoms of MDD 
was stable from 6 to 10 years. 
MDD symptoms evidenced some 
homotypical continuity, which 
extends the findings from short-term 
longitudinal studies on MDD in young 
children. 
9, 
 
50 The observed reduction 
in MVPA and increase in sedentary 
behavior are consistent with findings 
from previous research. 
19
Limitations
Although individuals fulfilling the DSM 
cutoff of 5 or more MDD symptoms 
do not seem qualitatively different 
from those with just under cutoffs, 
 
51 
and even though the correlates and 
predictors of subclinical depression 
are similar to those of the disorder, 
 
52 
our findings do not necessarily 
generalize to the disorder itself. Thus, 
research with substantially larger 
samples is required to determine 
whether objectively measured MVPA 
would decrease the risk of MDD in 
community children. Nonetheless, 
because previous research has

shown that there is a continuity in 
depressive symptoms from childhood 
to adolescence and later adulthood, 
 
53 
that an elevated level of MDD 
symptoms increases the risk of 
later MDD, 
 
54, 
55 and that subclinical 
depression may entail substantial 
impairment (also in the long run), 
 
56 
our findings suggest that increasing 
MVPA at the population level may lead 
to reduced symptoms of depression—
and the impairment that accompanies 
these symptoms in some children. 
Second, data were MNAR, which may 
have led to biased results. However, 
the selectivity of this attrition was 
modest and we used all available 
data in a full information maximum 
likelihood procedure, which leads to 
less biased results than complete case 
analysis when the data are MNAR. 
57 
Nonetheless, we cannot exclude that 
such bias along with unmeasured 
confounders such as self-image 
enhancement 
58 or increased social 
interactions 
59 may explain at least 
some of the results. The prevalence of 
psychiatric disorders is generally low 
in Norway, 
60 but whether the impact 
of MVPA on depressive symptoms also 
differ between countries should be 
examined in future studies.
CONCLUSIONS
MVPA predicts fewer future MDD 
symptoms in middle childhood, 
and such symptoms are moderately 
stable from the ages of 6 to 10 years. 
Sedentary activity in children does 
not alter the risk of future symptoms 
of depression, and depression does 
not influence the likelihood of MVPA 
or inactivity. Although the effect 
was small, our results indicate that 
increasing MVPA in children at 
the population level may prevent 
depression, at least at subclinical levels.
