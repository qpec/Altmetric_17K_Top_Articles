Miscarriage and intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) are devastating complications in
fetal/neonatal
alloimmune
thrombocytopenia
(FNAIT).
We
previously
reported
the
mechanisms for bleeding diatheses, but it is unknown whether placental, decidual immune
cells or other abnormalities at the maternal–fetal interface contribute to FNAIT. Here we
show that maternal immune responses to fetal platelet antigens cause miscarriage and IUGR
that are associated with vascular and immune pathologies in murine FNAIT models. Uterine
natural killer (uNK) cell recruitment and survival beyond mid-gestation lead to elevated
NKp46 and CD107 expression, perforin release and trophoblast apoptosis. Depletion of NK
cells restores normal spiral artery remodeling and placental function, prevents miscarriage,
and rescues hemorrhage in neonates. Blockade of NK activation receptors (NKp46, FcɣRIIIa)
also rescues pregnancy loss. These findings shed light on uNK antibody-dependent
cell-mediated cytotoxicity of invasive trophoblasts as a pathological mechanism in FNAIT,
and suggest that anti-NK cell therapies may prevent immune-mediated pregnancy loss and
ameliorate FNAIT.

 F
etal/neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia (FNAIT) is a
life-threatening gestational disease characterized by mater-
nal immune responses against fetal platelet antigens. FNAIT
leads to fetal/neonatal platelet destruction, bleeding disorders
ranging from mild cutaneous petechial to severe intracranial
hemorrhages (ICH), and fetal or neonatal death1–4. Incompat-
ibilities in gene polymorphisms between the mother and fetus
initiate the immune response3, 5. A total of 36 alloantigens have
been reported and approximately half are located on the extra-
cellular domains of integrin β3 subunit3, 4. In Caucasians, 70–90%
of reported cases are caused by human platelet antigen-1a, which
is due to a gene polymorphism in residue 33 (L33P) in β3 sub-
unit3, 5. Maternal antibodies generated during pregnancy cross the
placenta and target paternally inherited antigens on platelets and
other cell types, causing FNAIT6–8. We previously demonstrated
that transplacental passage of maternal anti-β3 integrin antibodies
impairs mouse fetal blood vessel development and causes bleeding
particularly in fetal and neonatal brains7, 9. Prevalence of FNAIT
is estimated at 0.5–1.5/1,000 liveborn neonates, but this number is
inaccurate because it does not include miscarried fetuses that are
inadequately documented10, 11. Some reports estimate that up to
30% of affected fetuses miscarry12. Mechanisms for in utero fetal
death and for reported intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) in
FNAIT, however, are largely unknown3, 13–15.
The most targeted antigen in FNAIT, β3 integrin, is not only
expressed on platelets and endothelial cells, but also expressed on
conceptus-derived
trophoblast
(placental)
cells.
Trophoblast
αIIbβ3 and αVβ3 integrins are early contributors to blastocyst
implantation and subsequent placental development including
spiral artery (SA) remodeling16–19. Deficient SA remodeling is
associated with pregnancy complications that include pre-
eclampsia (a hypertensive syndrome of mid-late pregnancy),
IUGR, and miscarriage20–22. β3 integrin-positive invasive tro-
phoblast cells expressing paternally inherited alloantigens are
reported to initiate immune responses through interactions with
maternal decidual immune cells23. Whether paternal β3 integrin-
positive trophoblast cells are recognized by the maternal immune
system and whether their migration and functions in SA remo-
deling are impaired in FNAIT have not been explored24, 25.
At early human and other mammalian implantation sites,
natural killer (NK) cells are highly enriched, transient lympho-
cytes that promote decidualization, including immune tolerance
and vascular development26–29. Unlike human peripheral NK
(CD56dim), decidual NK (dNK) cells (CD56bright) are non-
cytotoxic cells with angiogenic potential that appear to be
essential
for normal early decidual
angiogenesis30–32.
The
importance of NK cells in successful pregnancy has been defined
by studying pregnant mice devoid of NK cells, and by demon-
strating angiocrine properties of uterine NK (uNK) cells from
normal mice33. Mouse uNK cells are recruited in large numbers
to the mesometrial decidua between days 6–11 of pregnancy34, 35.
By mid-gestation (day 12), most mouse uNK cells have become
senescent and cell numbers have declined36. Notably, switches in
phenotypes and functions of d/uNK cells have been reported
during both human and mouse gestation37–39; for example, in
human pregnancy complications, different activating receptors
(NKp30, NKp46, and Fc gamma receptor FcɣRIIIa) and granule
content (perforin and granzyme) are upregulated40, 41
Human and mouse d/uNK cells tightly control extravillous
trophoblast (EVT/invasive) migration, making d/uNK and tro-
phoblast cells partners during pregnancy32, 42. Human tropho-
blasts uniquely do not express human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A
or HLA-B but EVTs express HLA-C, E, and G, molecular ligands
for NK cell allorecognition receptors42, 43. Perforin, released upon
dNK activation, is a main mediator of cytotoxicity. During preg-
nancy, inflammation (e.g., induced by IL17-producing helper
T cells (Th17), type 1 helper T cells (Th1), or lipopolysaccharide)
may alter NK cell quiescence and lead to abnormal activation44, 45.
Mounting evidence has linked NK cells to human and mouse
reproductive failure particularly when the NK cells become
adversely activated and mediate fetal demise by releasing
perforin46.
Placental pathologies are not well addressed in FNAIT,
although a clinical study reported that IUGR and fetal demise
occur as frequently as ICH11. Fetal loss may result from placental
pathologies antecedent to ICH. Given that β3 integrin is
expressed by trophoblasts, we hypothesized that in FNAIT
maternal immune responses to fetal antigens may trigger IUGR
and pregnancy loss, and that maternal anti-β3 integrin IgG may
form immune complexes on trophoblast cells to create targeted
binding sites for NK cell Fcγ receptors41, 47. These immune
complexes would then trigger NK cell-mediated antibody-
dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC), trophoblast cell
death, and subsequent pregnancy failure. To our knowledge, this
possibility has not been previously explored.
Here, using our murine FNAIT model7, 48 and human tro-
phoblast cell lines, we demonstrate that placental abnormalities
lead to IUGR and miscarriage. This is likely due to uNK cell
activation through NKp46 and perforin release causing tropho-
blast apoptosis. These uNK cell-mediated placental pathologies
are prevented by anti-NK antibody treatments. Furthermore,
these treatments reduce severity of bleeding in fetuses and neo-
nates, demonstrating their potential for therapeutic applications.
Results
Maternal responses to fetal β3 integrin cause miscarriage and
IUGR. To mimic human FNAIT and exposure to β3 integrin
antigens during gestation, Itgb3−/− females (referred to hereafter
as β3−/−) were transfused twice with wild-type (WT) platelets and
then bred with WT males as previously reported6, 7. These Itgb3−/−
females are referred to as “immune”. Naive β3−/− bred with WT
mice were used as the normal pregnancy control group since they
do not develop detectable levels of anti-β3 integrin antibody in
first pregnancy (studied here) or second pregnancy48. These
females are designated “non-immune”. Abnormal fetal develop-
ment and death were frequent in immune females at E14.5 ± 1.5.
Immune group fetuses had significantly lower body weights than
gestational-day-matched control fetuses (Fig. 1a). This was
accompanied by delayed organogenesis compared to fetuses
from non-immune pregnancies. IUGR preceded fetal demise at
E14.5 ± 1.5 in immune pregnant females. No deaths were
observed among normally growing fetuses in non-immune
pregnant β3−/− females (Table 1).
To address maternal immunity induced by platelet adminis-
tration, splenocyte suspensions were immunophenotyped by flow
cytometry. Splenomegaly was present in pregnant immune mice
with increased CD3+CD4+IL17+ cells (i.e., a Th17-polarized
immune response) compared to non-immune β3−/− pregnant
mice (Fig. 1b). As expected, immune β3−/− females bred with
β3−/− males did not develop splenomegaly or miscarriage. To
further demonstrate that maternal immunity specifically targets
only fetuses carrying paternally derived antigen, immune β3−/−
females were bred with β3−/+ males. These females lost their
heterozygote fetuses (β3−/+; Supplementary Fig. 1) around E14.5.
We further analyzed maternal plasma cytokines. IL12/23, IL17,
and
MCP-1
were
detected
in
all
pregnancies,
and
were
significantly elevated in immune compared to non-immune
pregnant females (Fig. 1c). In addition to Th17-polarized
cytokines, angiokines were lower in both plasma and placental
homogenates from immune mice. The plasma of immune
pregnant mice had less placental growth factor (PGF), more

 soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 (sFlt-1; Supplementary Fig. 2),
and a significantly lower PGF/sFlt-1 ratio than plasma from non-
immune pregnant mice (Fig. 1c). Since a lower than normal PGF/
sFlt-1 ratio or supranormal soluble endoglin-1 levels contribute to
the pathogenesis of preeclampsia in women49 and of impaired
placental vascularization in mice50, additional placental angio-
genic
signaling
molecules
were
investigated
(Fig.
1d).
In
comparison to plasma from non-immune pregnancies, immune
pregnant mice had significantly lower levels of pro-angiogenic
molecules including endothelin-1, matrix metalloproteinase-3,
fibroblast growth factor acidic, and vascular endothelial growth
factor. In contrast, the potent anti-angiogenic factors endoglin
and thrombospondin-2 and the pro-inflammatory cytokine
monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 were increased.
Impaired maternofetal placental exchange functions in FNAIT.
To assess fetal viability in vivo and placental hemodynamics,
ultrasound was performed on anesthetized pregnant mice7. Living
fetuses of immune mice displayed bradycardia compared to
fetuses of non-immune mice (Fig. 2a). Chorionic plate capillaries
in placentas of the latter conceptuses had large areas of Doppler
velocity; these areas were smaller in placentas from immune
pregnancies (Fig. 2a). To assess placental malperfusion, gross
placental anatomy of viable fetuses from immune and non-
immune mothers was compared ex vivo. Placentas of control
fetuses appeared dark red, whereas placentas of fetuses from
immune mothers were paler, suggesting ischemia (Fig. 2a). Slower
Doppler velocity in the placentas from immune mothers suggests
impaired placental vascularization or blood hyperviscosity. To
discriminate
between
these,
microcomputerized
tomography
(micro-CT) was conducted to visualize the arterial vasculature.
Placentas from non-immune mothers showed normal arterial
branching from the umbilical artery, and the injected yellow
contrast agent showed typical distal fetal capillaries in the labyr-
inth (Fig. 2b). This was confirmed by stereomicroscopic picto-
graphs of labyrinthine capillaries, as well as by quantification of
immunofluorescent staining of paraffin-embedded placental sec-
tions stained by endothelial cell-reactive isolectin IB4 (Fig. 2b). In
placentas from immune pregnancies, fetal capillary development
was significantly reduced in the labyrinth (Fig. 2b), suggesting that
deficient capillary development impairs placental exchange.
In vivo biotin transfusion studies were conducted to assess
placental exchange function. Immediately after fetal echography
on E14.5, biotin was injected intravenously into the pregnant
dams. To test whether maternal endogenous biotin can cross the
placenta and accumulate in fetal tissues, immunofluorescent
staining was conducted51. In non-immune pregnant mice, biotin
crossed the placenta and accumulated in fetal tissues, whereas
fetuses from biotin-injected immune mice had less fetal biotin
accumulation (Fig. 2c). Immunofluorescence using streptavidin-
Alexa-488 demonstrated significantly higher biotin accumulation
in the labyrinths of placentas from the immune mice (Fig. 2c).
Overall,
these experiments suggest
that maternal
immune
responses against β3 impede maternal to fetal placental exchange
function.
NK cells mediate immunopathology of the placenta in FNAIT.
To investigate the underlying mechanisms of placental abnorm-
alities, morphometric and immunopathological studies of pla-
centas were conducted. Histomorphometric studies of placentas
from non-immune mothers showed proper decidual development
at E14.5 with a decidua/labyrinth ratio ~0.4 (Fig. 3a). Decidua in
placentas from immune mice was twice as large as in controls,
significantly
increasing
the
decidua/labyrinth
ratio
to
0.7.
Decidual thickening, abnormal NK cell numbers, and reduced
trophoblast migration were reported in prior work by other
group52. In addition to their significantly greater abundance, uNK
cells in immune mice showed higher perforin and NKp46
expression (Fig. 3b). More cell-free, perforin-reactive granules
were observed in immune deciduas. In addition, percentage of
activated uNK cells expressing markers of degranulation, such as
CD107 (DBA+NKp46+CD107+ cells), was significantly increased
in immune mice (Fig. 3c). To address whether NK cell accu-
mulation and activation impair key processes of placentation in
late gestation, we started anti-NK cell treatment at E11.5. Inter-
estingly, we found that inhibition of activating receptor NKp46 or
anti-Asialo-GM-1 depletion of NK cells significantly prevented
miscarriage in immune mice at E14.5, allowing pregnancies to
progress to term (Table 2). These observations suggest a pivotal
role for activation of NK cells in FNAIT placental pathogenesis.
β3 integrin-positive trophoblasts interact with NK cells. First,
we addressed expression of β3 integrin by human first-trimester
placenta, first-trimester trophoblast cell lines (HTR-8/SVneo and
SWAN 71), and by mouse placentas. Placenta sections from first-
trimester human placentas (week 4.5, 5, and 9) expressed β3
integrin on syncytiotrophoblast and more importantly on invasive
EVT as shown by double staining with HLA-G and cytokeratin-7
(Fig. 4a). Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (positive control)
expressed β3 integrin, whereas platelet extract from β3−/− mice did
not (negative control; Fig. 4b). Human trophoblast cell lines
expressed β3 integrin as did mouse placentas across gestation
(E9.5–E18.5; Fig. 4b). Microscopic analyses of E14.5 implantation
sites identified numerous Dolichos biflorus agglutinin (DBA)+ NK
cells that appeared to interact with trophoblast cells expressing β3
integrin near the junctional zone. Significantly more interactions
were present at the immune vs. non-immune maternal–fetal
interface where uNK cells were less frequent and more senescent
(Fig. 4c). NK cells accumulating at the feto–maternal interface in
both non-immune and immune conditions were not proliferating
cells (Fig. 4d). Most proliferating cells were located in the labyrinth,
they appeared to be endothelial or trophoblast cells and their
numbers were significantly decreased in immune vs. non-immune
placentas (Fig. 4d).
NK cells resident in the decidua express both α1β1 and α2β1
integrins, which promote extracellular matrix attachment. To test
the origin of DBA-positive cells accumulating in decidua in non-
immune and immune states, α1 integrin staining was performed.
uNK cells from E14.5 non-immune mice expressed basal levels of
α1 integrin, suggesting a recent uNK infiltration (Fig. 4e), which
is also supported by adaptive transfer of pNK cells (Supplemen-
tary Fig. 3). In contrast, uNK cells from immune mice expressed
significantly higher levels (>2.5-fold) of α1, integrin suggesting
that
they
are
activated
resident
cells.
In
typical
mouse
pregnancies, most uNK cells die by senescence between E10.5
and E12.5 as observed in non-immune mice placentas (Fig. 4b).

integrin expression by stromal cells.
uNK cells induce trophoblast apoptosis in FNAIT. To further
investigate possible cellular and molecular mechanisms leading to
placental insufficiency, SA remodeling was investigated. Sig-
nificantly shorter SA diameters were documented in immune
placentas (Fig. 5a). In E14.5 non-immune placentas, endovascular
trophoblasts were found in significantly higher number in SA
(Fig. 5a). uNK cells in E14.5 immune placentas surrounded the
SA and trophoblast migration into the vessels appeared to be
impaired as trophoblast numbers were significantly decreased in
the SA (Fig. 5a). Indeed, endovascular trophoblasts were scarcely
present and smooth muscle actin (SMA) staining was markedly
greater in the SA of immune placentas (Fig. 5a). SMA staining in
non-immune placentas was low as expected in normal mouse
pregnancies (mean fluorescence intensity = 6 ± 3). SMA staining
was significantly higher in immune placentas (42 ± 11), but was
normalized in placentas from asialo-GM-1-treated mice (7 ± 6).

 To address the basis for reduced endovascular trophoblast in the
immune mice, dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) stain was
conducted. Significantly higher apoptosis of trophoblast was
found in the spiral arteries of immune placentas (Fig. 5a). Anti-
asialo-GM-1 treatment restored endovascular trophoblast survi-
val in the SA, ultimately allowing pregnancy progression. In
addition, western blots revealed that anti-asialo-GM-1 treatment
reduced NKp46 expression in uNK cell lysates (Fig. 5b). To

from deciduas of immune mice induced greater apoptosis in these

of anti-β3 IgG compared to control IgG, which was significantly

 alleviated by anti-Fcγ receptor blocker (2.4G2). uNKs from non-
immune pregnant mice did not induce significant ADCC on
similar target cells (Fig. 5b).
Depletion or inhibition of uNK cells prevents miscarriage. The
question of whether targeted removal or disarming of NK cells
could be a therapeutic strategy for prevention of FNAIT-induced
miscarriage was addressed. In immune females bred by WT males
where ~50% fetal loss occurs at E14.5, anti-asialo-GM-1 treat-
ment starting from E11.5 resulted in birth of normally sized litters
at term (n = 8; Fig. 6a). Of critical importance, anti-asialo-GM-1

restored normal platelet counts in neonates and prevented severe
bleeding often observed in neonates from untreated immune mice
(Fig. 6a). To test whether maternal anti-β3 integrin antibody and
NK cells result in ADCC in vivo, FcγRIIIas were blocked with
anti-FcγRIIIa, 2.4G2 antibody. This treatment also prevented
miscarriage (n = 5), albeit some fetuses developed ICH (not
shown) and had low platelet counts (Fig. 6a). Pregnancies were
also rescued following treatment with intravenous IgG (IVIG).
Inhibition of the NK cell activating receptor NKp46 that con-
tributes to perforin release46 also significantly increased litter
sizes at term in both severe (Fig. 6a) and moderate FNAIT
(Fig. 6b). Passive transfer by intravenous injections at E10.5 of
high titer anti-β3 IgG into non-immune β3−/− females bred with
WT did not significantly induce miscarriage but the pups dis-
played bleeding disorders including ICH. These better outcomes
of pregnancy suggest that manipulations of NK cells could be
important in the management of FNAIT and other antibody-
related pregnancy losses as already suggested by earlier studies54.
Discussion
Bleeding disorders in fetuses and neonates, particularly ICH, have
captured all of the clinical management attention in FNAIT25.
There is a lack of knowledge regarding placental pathology and
whether it provides the etiology for IUGR and fetal death55, 56.
Here we establish the importance of IUGR/miscarriages in
FNAIT. Strong evidence is provided that maternal alloantibody-
associated placental pathologies dictate not only the severity of
neonatal bleeding but importantly also the severity of IUGR/fetal
death. Pathogenesis is based upon interactions between FcɣRIIIa
of uNK cells with anti-β3 integrin immune complexes on invasive
trophoblasts that initiate ADCC. Both IUGR and miscarriage in
our mouse model of severe FNAIT could be prevented by anti-
asialo-GM-1-mediated NK cell depletion or by functional inhi-
bition of the NK cell receptors FcɣRIIIa or NKp46.
Although IUGR and fetal demise occur as frequently as ICH5, 11,
in human FNAIT, only chronic villitis has been reported as an
FNAIT-linked placental anomaly. Chronic deciduitis is a serious
inflammatory condition during pregnancy that is often associated
with preterm labor57. In our murine model of FNAIT, we observed
fetal distress prior to death by ultrasound examination that involved
placental (Doppler flow) and fetal (heart rate) compartments. We
also documented placental inflammation (decidual enlargement,
cytokine profiles, and NK cell hypercellularity with aberrant acti-
vation and prolonged survival in decidua basalis). Chronic decid-
uitis often results from fetal antigen stimulation causing placental
inflammation. This aligns with our finding that paternally derived
β3 integrin antigen is required for induction of placental inflam-
mation and FNAIT in our mouse model. Th17 cytokines and
deposition of maternal anti-β3 antibodies into decidua may play
roles in recruitment of post mitotic NK cells from the peripheral
circulation into decidua. In addition to inflammation in the
maternal part of the placenta, we found that endothelial cells were
reduced in the placental labyrinth, which showed vessel rarefaction
and capillary deficiencies and that, trophoblast proliferation was
significantly reduced in immune mice. Together, these features were
shown to limit molecular transport from the maternal to the fetal
compartment. This alone would be sufficient to explain fetal stress
(bradycardia) and IUGR as reported previously22. These features,
however, did not occur in isolation but were accompanied by
apoptosis of invasive trophoblast, loss of angiogenic molecules, gain
in anti-angiogenic signals, and failure of late gestational SA trans-
formation. Each of these would additionally reduce maternal sup-
port of placental function and incrementally reduce fetoplacental
nutrient availability. Whether or not the inadequate development of
the fetal labyrinthine vasculature results from nutrient insufficiency
will require further study.
uNK cells become locally “educated and licensed” at implan-
tation sites and typically are committed to protect against pla-
cental infection while preventing fetal loss58. It is still questionable
what triggers quiescent NK cells to become aggressive cytotoxic
killers cells46, 59, 60. A fetus resulting from allogeneic mating
expresses a variety of antigens that may serve as targets for
rejection by the maternal immune system, yet inhibition of killer
cells by hormones, stroma, and trophoblast cells typically prevents
that from occurring61. Placental inflammation and immune
complexes can alter this process considerably. The combination of
uNK cells and maternal anti-β3 antibodies had a profound effect
on survival of invasive trophoblasts and placental development.
The ability of uNK cells to initiate and sustain placental inflam-
mation and to effect ADCC against trophoblast is a dramatic
paradigm shift in our understanding of pregnancy failure. For a
long time, NK cells have been thought to be key contributors of
placental vascularization including initiation of SA remodeling62–64.
Tightly regulated interactions between NK cells and trophoblasts
dictate normal SA remodeling as dNK cells prevent excessive
invasion of trophoblasts and trophoblasts inhibit the maternal
immune response and fetal rejection29, 65. It has been reported
that FcɣR is essential during uNK activation at mid-gestation in
mice41, 47, 66. Given that maternal anti-β3 antibodies are capable
of binding to trophoblast cells, the resulting immune complexes
could be recognized by FcɣRIIIa on uNK cells. This initiated a

 cascade of outside-in signaling and uNK cell activation, and,
ultimately, NKp46 and CD107 upregulation and perforin release.
Subsequently, activated uNKs surrounded spiral arteries, induced
apoptosis of invasive trophoblasts, and stunted SA enlargement.
The NK cells that accumulated in immune deciduas were not
proliferating cells since they did not stain for Ki67. Given that
uNK cell numbers typically decline after mid-gestation (E11.5),
we speculate that newly recruited killer cells come from periph-
eral blood. This is supported by our observation that expression
of α1 integrin, which allows uNK cells to attach to the extra-
cellular matrix, is increased three-fold in placentas of immune
mice. Anti-asialo-GM-1-mediated NK cell depletion significantly
reduced uNK cell number in the deciduas of immune mice. The
remaining uNK cells in anti-asialo-GM-1-treated placentas did

 not cause placental pathology or fetal death, and both SA
remodeling and trophoblast survival were restored to normal.
More detailed, future phenotyping of the atypical, large, activated
uNK cells seen at E14.5 should identify the origins and potential
mixed composition of this pathogenic innate lymphoid cell
population.
This report identified uNKs as cellular targets and their acti-
vating receptors FcɣRIIIa and Nkp46 as molecular targets for
potential therapeutic intervention in clinical FNAIT, and poten-
tially other causes of antibody-related pregnancy loss. Anti-asialo-
GM-1-mediated NK cell depletion is a proof of concept that
aberrant maternal immune responses in the decidua can cause
placental dysfunction. It is possible that macrophages cooperate
with uNKs in inducing ADCC on trophoblast. In this respect the
beneficial effect of anti-FcɣRIII IgG and IVIG in preventing
miscarriage could be achieved by blocking different Fcɣ receptors
on uNK cells, decidual macrophages, and dendritic cells thereby
preventing placental inflammation and ADCC as previously
reported6, 10, 48. Since IVIG is a costly drug with an unclear
mechanism of action, its replacement by other, lower cost, and
higher specificity drugs is appropriate. Anti-FcɣRIIIa and anti-
Nkp46 monoclonal antibodies had good efficacy in rescuing
miscarriages in our mouse model. Whether these treatments
could be useful in humans warrants further investigation. In
summary, maternal immune responses to fetal platelet antigens
cause IUGR and miscarriage linked with vascular and immune
pathologies in placentas. Targeting of NK cells in FNAIT that
rescued miscarriage and reduced severity of bleeding in fetuses/
neonates should have great translational importance.
Methods
Mice. β3−/− mice were kindly provided by Dr. Richard O. Hynes (Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, Boston, MA, USA). All mice were housed in specific
pathogen-free research vivarium at St. Michael’s Hospital, Keenan Research Centre
after protocol approval by the St. Michael’s Hospital Animal Care Committee.
Permission was granted to perform animal experiments by the animal care com-
mittee). All procedures were in compliance with Guidelines of the Canadian
Council on Animal Care. β3−/− mice were backcrossed to a BALB/c background 10
times and bred to generate syngeneic gene-deficient mice. Experiments were per-
formed when female and male mice were 7–10 weeks of age. BALB/c WT mice
(stock number 028) were purchased from Charles River Canada.
Our FNAIT model was previously described6, 7, 10, 48, 67. Briefly, β3−/− females
were immunized twice, 1 week apart via tail vein injections of gel-filtered WT
platelets (1 × 108 for severe FNAIT or 1 × 107 for moderate FNAIT). Immunized
β3−/− females were bred with WT males (FNAIT group here after referred to as
immune). The control group of β3−/− females was non-immune and mated by WT
males. Immune and non-immune pregnant mice, their implantation sites, and
neonates were compared at matched time points. Gestation E0.5 corresponds to the
day a copulation plug was found. Immune females mated by β3−/− males were used
as a FNAIT-negative control to demonstrate that β3 expression in placenta is
required for induction of miscarriage. Immune females mated by β3−/+ males were
used to demonstrate that ADCC occurred only in β3−/+ but not in β3−/−
conceptuses from the same mother. Additionally, injections of anti-β3 immune
sera into non-immune mice (bred by WT male) served as a passive FNAIT model
to test whether only anti-β3 can induce or not ADCC.

(Mississauga, ON, Canada). The angiogenesis array (Cat# ARY015) was purchased
from R&D Systems (Burlington, ON, Canada). Anti-CD107-APC (Cat# 130-102-
191, clone: 1D4B, d = 100), anti-NKp46-vioblue (Cat# 130-103-137, clone: 29A1.4.9,

APC (Cat# 130-102-791, clone: 145-2C11, d = 100), and anti-IL17-PE (Cat# 130-
103-015, clone: TC11-18H10, d = 100) were obtained from Miltenyi Biotec
(Auburn, CA, USA). For placental casts, a radio-opaque silicone rubber X-ray
contrast agent (Microfil, Cat# MV-122) was obtained from Flow Tech (Carver, MA,
USA). Anti-mouse NKp46 was from Biolegend (Cat# 137614) and rabbit anti-
asialo-GM-1 (Cat# CL8955) was from Cederlane (Burlington, ON, Canada); anti-

d = 100), and pan-cytokeratin (Cat# ab20206, d = 100) were from Abcam (Cam-
bridge, MA USA). In Situ Cell Death Detection Kit (Cat# 11684795910) was from
Roche Diagnostics (Canada, Laval, QC, Canada). Trophoblast cell lines (HTR-8/
SVneo representing first-trimester human EVTs60 and Swan 71, representing
telomerase-induced immortalized first-trimester human trophoblasts) were from
Dr. Stephen Lye lab, Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute, Mount Sinai Hos-
pital, and University of Toronto. These were maintained between passage 14 and 20,
and they retained hallmarks of first-trimester trophoblast. HTR-8/SVneo was cul-
tured in RPMI-1640 medium, whereas Swan 71 in DMEM F-12K. These media
were supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 IU ml−1 of penicillin,
and 100 μg ml−1 of streptomycin (Invitrogen) and cells were incubated at 37 °C with
5% CO2.
Ultrasound imaging followed by biotin injection. To identify the gestational age at
which fetal loss occurred, serial high-frequency ultrasound imaging of each pregnant
mouse to assess fetal vitality, cardiac function, and intraplacental blood flow was
performed at embryo days E.11.5, E.13.5, E14.5, and E.15.5 as previously described7.
Since ultrasound revealed that fetal deaths occurred at E14.5 ± 1.5, all subsequent
experiments were carried out at E14.5. Pregnant mice were anesthetized with 2%
isoflurane (inhaled) and maintained on 1% during imaging. After abdominal shaving,
chemical depilation (Nair™, Church & Dwight Co, Inc.) and application of coupling
gel (37 °C), high-frequency ultrasound imaging was performed by nonlinear contrast
imaging using a Vevo® 2100 system and a MS550 transducer (32–56 MHz). After
ultrasound, some animals were intravenously injected with biotin (0.25 g per kg body
weight) to test maternal–fetal transport of essential nutrient51. Biotin is transported by
its sodium-dependent multivitamin transporter68. In normal placenta intravenous
biotin injection to the mother can be detected in the fetuses after 15 min. Animals
were killed by cervical dislocation 15 min later. Placentas and fetuses were harvested
from these mice and processed for biotin staining with streptavidin.
Contrasted micro-CT scanning. Microfil was infused into the fetoplacental vascu-
lature as previously described52. Briefly, individual E14.5 implantation sites were
removed from chilled uteri. Fetus and placenta were surgically exposed and bathed in
37 °C phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) to resuscitate the fetus and resume circulatory
function. A double-lumen glass cannula was advanced into the umbilical artery. Blood

blotting showing expression of β3 integrin by trophoblast cell line (right panel; HTR-8/SVneo and Swan 71) as well as mouse placenta (left panel). c At the
maternal–fetal interface, fetal allogeneic trophoblast cells interact with maternal killer cells in the decidua. Trophoblasts (glycogen cells) in the junctional
zone also showed more interactions with NK cells (yellow arrows) in immune mice placenta (left panel). These interactions were rare in the decidua of non-
immune mice where the NK cells near junctional zone appeared senescent (right panel). d uNK cells from both non-immune and immune mice were not
proliferating cells (top panel). The proliferating cells (Ki67-positive cells) were localized in the labyrinth and their numbers were significantly reduced in
placentas of immune compared to non-immune mice (bottom panel). e Non-immune mice had lower levels of α1 integrin expression (top panel, left).
Placentas from immune mice showed significantly upregulated α1 integrin expression, suggesting stronger tethering of uNK cells to extracellular matrix
(top panel, center). Anti-asialo-GM-1 treatment reduced uNK cell accumulation (top panel, right). Data were collected from eight pregnancies per group.

Fig. 5 Mechanisms of NK cell-mediated trophoblast apoptosis. a SA diameters were significantly larger in both non-immune and anti-asialo-GM-1-treated
immune mouse placentas, whereas SA diameter was significantly reduced in placentas of non-treated immune mice, which showed higher expression of smooth
muscle actin (black arrow, top histology panel). Spiral artery (SA) remodeling in placentas from non-immune mice showed presence of infiltrated endovascular
trophoblasts. uNK cells surrounding maternal vessels impaired trophoblast migration into SA of immune mice. This was significantly ameliorated by anti-asialo-
GM-1 treatment, which reduced NK cells’ accumulation in the placenta (middle immunofluorescence panel). TUNEL staining of placentas from immune mice further
confirmed apoptosis of trophoblasts surrounding SA. These abnormalities were significantly ameliorated by anti-asialo-GM-1 treatment (bottom

treatment also reduced NKp46 expression (top panel). Purified uNK cells from immune pregnant mice induced antibody-mediated cell cytotoxicity on a cultured

 was cleared from the vasculature using heparinized saline with xylocaine. The contrast
agent was perfused into the arterial vasculature until its bright yellow color could be
seen in the capillary bed, and then the vessels were tied off to maintain pressure. The
silicone rubber was allotted time to polymerize before the umbilical cord was severed
and the placenta was immersion-fixed (10% buffered formalin phosphate; 48 h; 4 °C).
Specimens were mounted in 1% agar made with 10% formalin for scanning. Three-
dimensional (3D) data sets were acquired for each specimen using an MS-9 micro-CT
scanner (GE Medical Systems, London, ON, Canada).
Histology and TUNEL staining. For histological analysis, placental tissue was fixed
in formalin, paraffin-embedded, sectioned (8 μm), transferred to glass slides, and
stained with hematoxylin and eosin using standard techniques. For immunohis-
tochemistry staining and immunofluorescent, paraffin-embedded tissue sections of
mouse placenta and human placenta samples from Toronto Biobank were process
for antigen retrieval. uNK cells and HTR-8/SVneo cells that had been co-cultured
on coverslips were fixed with paraformaldehyde (PFA, 4% w/v, 5 min). Placenta
sections and cultured cells were blocked in 5% bovine serum albumin and then
incubated with the primary antibody of interest overnight. After washing, the
secondary antibody (anti-rabbit IgG-Cy3 or Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated goat anti-
rabbit IgG) and avidin alexa-488 or avidin-Cy3 conjugated were incubated for 1 h,
as previously described7. Apoptosis was detected in tissue sections via TUNEL
staining with an In Situ Cell Death Detection Kit, according to the manufacturer’s
protocol. Briefly, paraffin-embedded placental sections were fixed in PFA (4%,
5 min, room temperature (RT)) and permeabilized. Positive controls were treated
with 100 U DNase I for 30 min at 37 °C. Slides were incubated with reaction buffer
for 1 h, wash three times in 0.1% PBS-T, and then mounted in Vectashield
mounting medium containing 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride
(DAPI) for nuclear counterstaining. Fluorescent images were acquired using
Olympus upright or Zeiss confocal microscopes and analyzed by Image J software
(US National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA).
In vivo anti-NK cell treatments and passive FNAIT models. NK cell depletion or
inhibition of the NK cell activation receptors (NKp46 or FcɣRIIIa) started at E11.5.
Intraperitoneal injection of 50 µl of undiluted anti-asialo-GM-1 serum was used for
NK cell depletion at E11.5 and E14.5 (n = 8). Anti-NKp46 (3.33 mg per kg body
weight) and anti-FcγRIIIa (6.66 mg per kg body weight)69 treatments were given
intravenously at E11.5 and E14.5 (n = 4). IVIG, a commonly used drug for FNAIT
management, was compared to anti-NK therapies. IVIG (1 g per kg body weight)6
was intraperitoneally injected into immune mice twice at E.0.5 and E7.5 (n = 6).

Fig. 6 Inhibition of activating receptors and NK cell depletion prevent IUGR/fetal death. a Non-immune mice had normal pregnancies and delivered healthy
pups. Litter sizes were not affected in immune females mated by β3−/− males. In immune mice, miscarriages (red arrows, resorbed fetuses) were frequent
as well as severe bleeding in neonates (blue arrows for ICH) and low neonatal platelet counts. NK cell depletion induced by anti-asialo-GM-1 serum
prevented miscarriages and bleeding in neonates. Inhibition of NK cell activation through NKp46 or FcγRIIIa blockade or IVIG ameliorated pregnancy
outcomes (litter size). b Anti-NKp46 treatment in moderate FNAIT (induced by lower dose of 107 platelet transfused/immunization) also prevented
miscarriages. Injections of high titer anti-β3 integrin IgG sera into non-immune mice did not cause miscarriage, albeit some neonates developed bleeding
and ICH. Data were collected in four to eight pregnancies per group. Unpaired Student’s t-test (b); two-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni post hoc test

 dissection, decidua and mesometrial lymphoid aggregate of pregnancy were dis-
sected, each tissue type was pooled by litter and finely minced. Tissue was then
transferred into Hank’s solution (37 °C) containing DNase I for enzymatic dis-
sociation. Every 10 min, the solution was gently pipetted up and down with Pasteur
pipettes. After 1 h incubation time, the slurry was passed through a nylon tissue
strainer to obtain a single-cell suspension, and then washed twice in cold medium,
and enumerated for viability and cell number. uNK cells were prepared by DBA-
positive selection as previously reported70. Briefly, red blood cells were lysed by
3.5% NaCl. Decidual and stroma cells were removed by adherence after cen-
trifugation (400 × g, 5 min). Placental leucocytes were recovered and then separated
by density gradient centrifugation (Lympholyte®-M; 1400 × g; 30 min). The leu-
cocyte preparation was washed in 2% FBS in 1× PBS and loaded on DBA-lectin-
coated magnetic beads for 15 min at 4 °C. Retained uNK cells were eluted after a 5
min incubation with 2% FBS in 1× PBS containing 0.1 M N-acetyl-D-
galactosamine and pelleted in RPMI-1640 supplemented with 10% FBS and 1 mg
ml−1 gentamycin for culture. To assess cytotoxicity, NK cells were co-cultured with
cell tracer CMFDA-stained HTR-8/SVneo cells at a 2:1 ratio. After 24 h incubation,
anti-caspase-3 was utilized to detect cell death. Peripheral NK cells were purified by
positive selection using anti-NKp46 antibody and cells were labeled with cell tracer
fluorescence dye (5-(and-6)-Carboxyfluorescein Diacetate, Succinimidyl Ester),
then injected to pregnant mice at E13.5 and tracked within the recipient organs.
Detection of T helper-17 and uNK cells by cytometry. Spleens from pregnant
mice at E14.5 were enzymatically digested and passed through a nylon tissue strainer to
obtain a single-cell suspension. Red blood cells were lysed by 3.5% NaCl. Spleen leu-
cocytes were obtained by density gradient centrifugation (Lympholyte®-M; 1400 × g;
30 min). Splenocytes or uNK cells were incubated for 30 min at 22 °C with the
following antibodies: anti-CD4-APC, anti-CD3e-APC, and anti-IL17-PE (spleno-
cytes) or DBA-Alexa-488, NKp46-Vioblue and CD107-APC (uNK). Cells were
analyzed by flow cytometry (Miltenyi), at least 20,000 events were scored and
analyzed with Flow Jo software. Single cells were gated for CD4 (Vioblue) and
CD3e (APC) to select double-positive cells. Then, these double-positive cells were
gated on PE for IL17. The percentage of CD4+CD3e+ IL17+ cells corresponds to
triple-positive cells from the total splenocyte preparations (Supplementary Fig. 4).
Single cells were gated on Alexa-488 to select DBA+ cells, and then these cells were
gated on Vioblue and APC to select NKp46 and CD107 double-positive cells
CD107.
Western blotting and angiokines cytokine array analyses. In preparation for
western blotting, HTR-8/SVneo and Swan 71 human trophoblast cell lines were
harvested from confluent flasks. These cells and mouse placenta tissue were lysed in
radioimmuno-precipitation assay buffer, supernatant collected after centrifugation
(×10,000 g) and stored at −20 °C until western blotting. Protein (25 µg) from the cell
lysates or placenta homogenates was analyzed by western blotting, as previously
described7. Briefly, protein samples were electrophoresed on 8% SDS polyacrylamide
gels and electrotransferred onto polyvinylidene fluoride membranes. Immunodetec-
tions were carried out with specific antibodies of interest (Supplementary Fig. 5). For
the angiogenic array, E14.5 mouse placenta homogenates were subjected to immu-
noblotting as recommended by the manufacture (R&D System). Immobilized anti-
gens were detected by chemiluminescence using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated
secondary antibodies, an ECL kit, and autoradiography on Kodak film.
Statistical analysis. Data shown are mean ± SEM. Statistical comparisons were
made using an unpaired Student’s t-test or two-way ANOVA followed by Bon-
ferroni post hoc test as appropriate. Densitometry and immunofluorescence ana-
lysis was performed using Image J software (National Institutes of Health) and
values were normalized to internal control or total β-actin. In comparing fetal
survival 95% confidence interval for proportion were calculated using litter size and
percentage of alive fetuses (https://www.allto.co.uk/tools/statistic-calculators/
confidence-interval-for-proportions-calculator/). In each pregnancy, three to four
placentas or fetuses from same mother were analyzed and averaged (n). Statistical
analysis was performed on the mean values from several mothers (N). Differences
were considered statistically significant when p < 0.05.
