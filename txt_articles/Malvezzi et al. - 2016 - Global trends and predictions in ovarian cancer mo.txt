Background: Over the last two decades, ovarian cancer mortality rates have levelled or declined. There are, however,
persisting and substantial differences in ovarian cancer patterns and trends.
Patients and methods: We updated global trends in ovarian cancer mortality to 2012, and predicted trends in rates to
2020 using data from the World Health Organization database.
Results: In the EU, age-adjusted ovarian cancer mortality rates decreased 10% between 2002 and 2012, to 5.2/
100 000. The decline was ∼16% in the USA, to 4.9/100 000 in 2012. Latin American countries had lower rates, and
declines were observed in Argentina and Chile. Likewise, modest declines (−2.1%) were observed in Japan, whose rate
remained low (3.2/100 000 in 2012). Australia had a rate of 4.3/100 000 in 2012, and a 12% decline. The falls were larger
in young women, than in middle or old age. Recent rates at age 20–49 were higher in Japan than in the EU and the USA.
Predictions to 2020 indicate a further 15% decline in the USA and 10% in the EU and Japan.
Conclusions: The main reason for the favourable trends is the use of oral contraceptives (OCs), particularly, in the USA
and countries of the EU where OCs were introduced earlier. Declines in menopausal hormone use may also have played
a favourable role in elderly women, as well as improved diagnosis, management and treatment.

introduction
Over the last two decades, ovarian cancer mortality rates have
tended to level off and decrease in several high-income European
countries and North America, where rates were highest [1–4].
The falls were greater in young and middle-aged women than
in the elderly, and earlier and larger in the USA, the UK and
northern Europe [5]. These are the countries where oral contra-
ceptives (OCs)—which have a long-term protective effect on
ovarian cancer risk [6–8]—were introduced earlier and used
more frequently. Advancement in diagnosis and treatment may
also have influenced these trends, particularly in high-income
countries [3, 4, 9].
However, persisting marked differences in ovarian cancer pat-
terns and trends across various areas of the world [2] remain.
To provide a comprehensive picture of recent patterns and
trends in ovarian cancer mortality, we considered most recent
global death certification rates available (up to 2012 in most
countries), and provided predictions to 2020 [10] for selected
larger countries or groups of countries.
materials and methods
We obtained official death certification data for ovarian cancer from 1970 to
2012 or the most recent available year in each country, from the World
Health Organization (WHO) database, available on electronic support [11].
Figures were derived for the EU as a whole (28 countries as of July 2013,
minus Cyprus due to data unavailability), plus other 4 European countries,
11 American countries and 6 other countries worldwide. We excluded coun-
tries with <2 million inhabitants, or with <500 ovarian cancer deaths in
2005–2009. Further details are given in the supplementary Appendix, avail-
able at Annals of Oncology online.
During the calendar period considered, three different Revisions of the
International Classification of Diseases (ICD) were used [12–14]. Ovarian
cancer deaths were recorded according to the 10th Revision of the ICD
(C56-C57.4).
From the matrices of certified deaths and resident population, we com-
puted age-specific rates for each 5-year age group (from 0–4 to 85+ years,
and from 0–4 to 80+ for the Americas) and calendar year or quinquiennium.
We then computed age-standardised mortality rates per 100 000 women
using the direct method on the basis of the world standard population at all
ages, and at ages 20–49, 50–69 and 70–79 years [15].
We used joinpoint regression models [16], allowing for up to three join-
points, to identify significant changes in mortality trends for 19 major coun-
tries worldwide and the EU as a whole. For each of the trends identified by
the joinpoint model, we computed the estimated annual per cent changes

 (APC) and the average annual per cent change (AAPC) over the whole
period [17, 18].
For eight large countries (France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Spain, UK, the
USA and Japan) and the EU, we predicted ovarian cancer deaths and rates
for 2020 [10]. These were derived by fitting a joinpoint model to the number
of certified deaths in each 5-year age group to identify the most recent trend
segment. Subsequently, a linear regression was applied to the mortality data
in each age group over the time period identified by the joinpoint model. We
thus computed the predicted age-specific number of deaths, and the 95%
prediction intervals (PIs). Predicted standardised mortality rates, and their
95% PIs, were computed using the projected populations from EUROSTAT,
the USA Census Bureau, and the Japanese National Institute of Population
and Social Security Research (IPSS) databases [19–21].
results
Table 1 shows mortality data from ovarian cancer at all ages and
20–49, 50–69 and 70–79 years from 31 European countries, the
EU and selected countries worldwide around 2002 (2000–2004
quinquennium), 2007 (2005–2009 quinquennium) and 2012
(single year, or the closest available year when missing), along
with per cent changes between 2012 and 2002.
At all ages, EU mortality rates decreased from 5.8 to 5.2/
100 000 (−9.9%) between 2002 and 2012. All European coun-
tries, except Bulgaria, showed downward trends. Across major
European countries, the per cent changes varied between −8%
in Poland and −24% in Sweden. The declines were larger in nor-
thern and most central Europe, where ovarian cancer rates were
highest in the past. The declines in North America were greater
than in the EU. The USA per cent change was −16%, and in
2012 overall mortality rates were ∼4.9 in the USA and Canada.
The pattern was inconsistent in Latin America, with a few
declines (Argentina, Chile and Uruguay) and other upward
trends. In 2012, overall rates were systematically lower in Latin
America (between 2.8/100 000 in Brazil and 4.3 in Uruguay)
than in North America or Europe.
Ovarian cancer rates declined moderately in Japan and Hong
Kong, but not Korea, which however had the lowest rate (2.3/
100 000) among the countries considered. The falls in Australia
and New Zealand were ∼12%, and rates in 2012 were similar to
those in North America.
The declines in ovarian cancer mortality were systematically
larger in the young (20–49 years). In the EU, the fall was from
2.0 to 1.6 (−21.7%). However, in Japan, rates in the young only
decreased slightly, to 1.9/100 000 in 2012, i.e. a higher rate than
in the EU and the USA (1.2/100 000). Australia and New
Zealand had the lowest rates for young women in 2012. In
middle-aged women (50–69 years), the EU ovarian cancer mor-
tality rate was 20.3 in 2002 and 18.1 in 2012 (−10.7%). The
decline was −12.1% in the USA.
In the EU, the rate for 70- to 79-year-old women only
declined modestly from 39.6 in 2002 to 38.7 in 2012 (−2.2%).
Denmark had the greatest decline (−30.9%), and an over 10%
decline was registered in the UK, too. The USA had the greatest
decline among major countries, with ovarian cancer mortality
rates of 44.3 in 2002 and of 36.5 in 2012 (−17.6%). Argentina
also had changes of about −16%.
Figure 1 displays all ages ovarian cancer mortality rates in 2012
from largest to smallest. Lithuania and Ireland had the highest
rates (7.1). Other northern, central and eastern European countries
also had high rates, between 5 and 7/100 000. France, Italy, Spain
and Greece had lower rates (4.5–3.5/100 000). The EU overall had
a higher ovarian cancer mortality rate (5.2) than the USA, Canada
(4.9) and Australia (4.3). Most Latin American countries had rates
below 4/100 000, similarly to Japan (3.2/100 000) and other Asian
countries. Further country-specific comments are given in the sup-
plementary Appendix, available at Annals of Oncology online.
Figure 2 and supplementary Appendix Table SA2, available at
Annals of Oncology online, display the joinpoint analysis results
for ovarian cancer mortality trends at all ages in 20 selected
larger countries worldwide between 1970 and 2012. The EU
shows an unfavourable significant trend (+0.9 APC) up to the
1990s, and a descending significant trend thereafter (−1.1
APC). Figure 3 gives the results for joinpoint analysis on rates
for the four considered age groups (all ages, 20–49, 50–69 and
70–79 years) in the EU, the USA and Japan. US rates were
downwards throughout the studied period with the exception of
the 70–79 age group showing a rising trend (1.3 APC) between
1979 and 1992, and a subsequent decline.
Figure 4 gives the overall ovarian cancer mortality predicted
to 2020 for selected major countries. All of these, except Spain,
which however had one of the lowest rates, showed favourable
predicted trends. The overall predicted decline is ∼15% in the
USA, to 3.9/100 000, 10% in Japan to 2.9/100 000 and ∼10% in
the EU, to 4.8/100 000. Within Europe, the predicted decline is
larger in the UK, and similar across other countries, except
Spain.
discussion
The present global report shows the persistence of falls in
ovarian cancer mortality over the last decade in Europe and
North America. The falls were larger at young and middle age,
while death rates were approximately stable in the old in
Europe, but declined in North America. Still, in 2012, there was
an over twofold difference between the high mortality areas of
central and northern Europe—with overall ovarian cancer rates
over 6/100 000—and the low mortality ones—around or below
3/100 000—in Asia and South America. In young women (20–
49), however, ovarian cancer rates were higher in Japan than in
the EU and USA. For some of these countries, problems with
death certification coverage and validity may partly account for
their low rates, but this cannot explain the low rates in Korea,
Japan or Argentina, whose death certification is considered
reasonably valid [22, 23].
In the late 1990s, there was an about threefold variation in
ovarian cancer rates across Europe (from 3.6 in Portugal to
9.3 in Denmark) [5], which has reduced over recent years. The
largest western European countries have rates between 3.7 and
5.9/100 000. The recent favourable trends in ovarian cancer
mortality in North America and Europe can be partly or largely
attributed to the long-term protection of OC on ovarian cancer
risk and recent declines in menopausal hormonal therapy use
[6, 7, 24]. Indeed, the falls are larger in countries of northern
Europe and in the USA, where OC use was earlier and more
widespread [6, 25]. In the USA and UK, rates were appreciably
downwards in 70–79 years old women as well [26]. These
women born in 1930s and early 1940s were the first generation
to use OCs frequently.

 A recent decrease in menopause hormone use—a recognised
risk factor [25, 27–30]—after the Women’s Health Initiative
report in 2002 [31] may also partly explain the fall in rates for
middle aged and elderly women in countries like Germany, the
UK or the USA, where the use of menopausal hormones was
more common [24, 28, 31]. Part of the falls in these countries
may be due to the fact that they had the highest ovarian cancer
rates in the past and—as for breast [32], or colorectal [33]
cancer—mortality rates tend to level off across Europe.
Delays in the adoption of recent advancements in diagnosis
and management may have unfavourably affected mortality in
central and eastern European countries in ovarian as other

the treatment of ovarian germ cell tumours, which account for
<10% of all ovarian cancers [34]. It is difficult, to explain the
persisting high rates in central and eastern Europe. Fertility has
been relatively low in that area over the last decades, and parity

 and breastfeeding are protective on ovarian cancer risk [8, 35,
36]. However, differences in fertility across Europe [37] hardly
explain the substantial differences.
Other environmental factors, including obesity [38] and diet
[39], have been related to ovarian cancer risk. The quantification
of their effect on national mortality rates remains undefined.
It is also difficult to explain the low rates in Japan and Korea.
Diet and leanness in the past [38, 39] may partly account for
them, but parity and OC use were relatively low in those countries.
Thus, hormonal and reproductive features cannot account for
their low rates. Recent trends in these countries have not been de-
clining appreciably, suggesting a future global levelling of ovarian

Background: We have previously reported that there is little evidence of population ‘cure’ among two populations of
women diagnosed with invasive breast cancer. ‘Cure’ has not yet been examined in the context of screen-detection.
Patients and methods: We examined cancer registry data on 19 800 women aged 50–70, diagnosed with a primary,
invasive, non-metastatic breast cancer between 1 April 1989 and 31 March 2011 in the West Midlands region of England,
linked to Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) and the National Breast Screening Service (NBSS). Follow-up was complete
on all women up to 31 July 2012. Analyses were stratified by screening status, age, tumour stage, deprivation and
