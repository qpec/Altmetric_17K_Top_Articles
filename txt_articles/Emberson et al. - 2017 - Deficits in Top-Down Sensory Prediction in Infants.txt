SUMMARY
A prominent theoretical view is that the brain is inherently predictive [1, 2] and that prediction 
helps drive the engine of development [3, 4]. While infants exhibit neural signatures of top-down, 
sensory prediction [5, 6], it must be established that deficits in early prediction alter developmental 
trajectories to start to infer causality between prediction and development. We investigated 
prediction in infants born prematurely, a leading cause of neuro-cognitive impairment worldwide 
[7]. Prematurity, independent of medical complications, leads to developmental disturbances [8, 9, 
10, 11, 12] and a broad range of developmental delays [13, 14, 15, 16, 17]. Is an alteration in early 
prediction abilities the common cause? Using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), we 
measured top-down, sensory prediction in preterm infants (born <33 weeks) before infants 
exhibited clinically-identifiable developmental delays (6 months corrected age). While preterm 
infants had typical neural responses to presented visual stimuli, they exhibited altered neural 
responses to predicted visual stimuli. Importantly, a separate behavioral control confirmed that 
preterm infants detect pattern violations at the same rate as full-terms, establishing selectivity of 
this response to top-down predictions (e.g., not in learning an AV association). These findings 
suggest that top-down, sensory prediction plays a crucial role in development and deficits in this 
ability may be the reason why preterm infants experience altered developmental trajectories and 
are at-risk for poor developmental outcomes. Moreover, this work presents an opportunity for 
establishing a neuro-biomarker for early identification of infants at-risk and could guide to early 
intervention regimens.

 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The goal of this study is to establish a direct link between the neuro-cognitive impairments 
associated with prematurity and an infant’s ability to predict upcoming sensory input. To this 
end, we restricted our preterm population (born <33 weeks gestation) to those who did not 
experience severe medical complications or neurological insults and conducted the study 
before preterm infants have missed any clinically-identifiable developmental milestones: Six 
months corrected age, matching to full-terms on time since conception and not extra-uterine 
experience. Testing at this young age allows us to circumvent the possibility that differences 
in prediction are arising from differences in developmental stage across the groups. 
Moreover, we employed a model task approach where all infants receive equal experience 
with novel stimuli to control for possible differences in experience outside the lab.
Using fNIRS, a method for recording the hemodynamic response in the surface of the cortex 
using light [18, 19, 20, 21], we recorded neural responses in 100 infants (50 preterm) to 
presented as well as predicted auditory and visual stimuli (see Figure 1). Following directly 
from findings in cognitive neuroscience (most closely [22, 2]), an important neural signature 
of top-down, sensory prediction are responses to omitted information. If the developing 
brain is generating top-down predictions, an unexpected omission of visual information will 
result in activity in the same regions of the brain that process visual information. This has 
been observed in 6-month-old full-term infants: visually-selective regions of the infant brain 
respond when visual input is unexpectedly omitted but exhibit no activity when the visual 
information was not expected to appear [5]. This paper extends this finding to infants at-risk 
for poor developmental outcomes. To calculate the magnitude of the hemodynamic response, 
normalized changes in blood oxygenation were averaged from 5–9 seconds after stimulus 
onset within two neuroanatomically-defined ROIs (Figure 1; occipital: 3 NIRS channels; 
temporal: 5 NIRS channels, see Supplemental Information and [5, 23] for details on the MR-
fNIRS co-registration method).
Prematurity Results in Differences for Predicted but not Presented Sensory Input
Preterm and full-term infants exhibit the same pattern of response to presented auditory and 
visual stimuli. Building from [5], we examined the neural response of full-term infants 
during audiovisual trials in the temporal and occipital ROIs and confirm the hypothesized 
perceptual cortex responses to auditory and visual stimuli: There is a significant increase 
from baseline in both the temporal (t(35) = 4.18, p<.001, d = 0.70) and occipital (t(35) = 
4.74, p<.001, d = 0.79) ROIs. Importantly, we find the same pattern of perceptual cortex 
responses in preterm infants: they exhibited a robust response in temporal and occipital ROIs 
during audiovisual trials (temporal: t(42) = 4.57, p<.001, d = 0.70; occipital: t(42) = 3.13, 
p<.003162, d = 0.48, Fig. 2).
However, preterm and full-term infants differ in their responses to visual omission trials, 
where the predicted visual stimulus is unexpectedly omitted. Full-term infants exhibit a 
robust occipital lobe response to the unexpected omission of a visual stimulus (t(35)=3.63, 
p<.001, d=0.61, Fig. 2: right panel) that is statistically indistinguishable from the response of 
this region to the presentation of the visual stimulus in the audiovisual trials (t(35)=1.51, p=.
14, d=0.22). Thus, we find consistent patterns to previous work [5] showing occipital lobe

 responses in 6-month-olds to the unexpected absence of a visual event [see 22, for a detailed 
investigation of these effects in adults using fMRI]. However, in contrast, preterm infants 
exhibit a significant difference in occipital response levels between audiovisual trials and 
visual omission trials, t(42)=6.31, p<.001, d=0.86. This difference between preterm and full-
term infants is also highlighted by the fact that there appears to be a negative occipital 
response during visual omission trials among the preterm infants, t(42)= −2.44, p=.01878, 
d=0.37. Thus, while preterm infants exhibit a robust response to an unexpected visual 
omission, the response is negative and significantly reduced from the responses of the same 
region to the presentation of a visual stimulus.
Directly comparing occipital cortex responses between preterm and full-term infants across 
audiovisual and visual omission trials (mixed ANOVA) reveals a significant interaction of 
trial type and birth status, F(1,77)=4.61, p=.035, η2=.04, which is driven by a difference 
between preterm and full-term infants in occipital lobe response levels during visual 
omission trials, t(55.60)= −4.36, p<.001, d=1.03, and a significant difference across trial 
types in preterm but not full term infants. There are additionally main effects for birth status, 
F(1,77)=13.92, p<.001, η2=.15 and trial type, F(1,77)=24.98, p<.001, η2=.23 There is also a 
significant difference in occipital response during visual present trials between the two 
groups, t(62.40)= −2.23, p=.0295, d=0.52. Importantly, these findings are specific to the 
occipital cortex: As both trial types are initiated by the presentation of an identical, 
predictive auditory cue, no differences in temporal lobe activation are predicted. Indeed, 
there are no main effects for birth status, F(1,77) =2.40, p=.162, η2 =.03 or trial type, 
F(1,77)=1.02, p=.316, η2=.01, and no significant interaction, F(1,77)=.88, p=.351, η2=.01. 
Both groups of infants exhibit a strong, positive temporal cortex response to visual omission 
trials (full-terms t(35)=4.73, p<.001, d=.79; preterms: t(42)=4.29, p<.001, d=.65. Fig. 2, left 
panel).
There are numerous explanations for negative hemodynamic responses in the fMRI 
literature. First, it may be that the negative response we observed when preterm infants 
experience an unexpected visual omission reflects a suppression of neural activity below 
spontaneous or baseline levels [24]. This interpretation of the negative BOLD response 
would result in the conclusion that preterm infants exhibit a neural pattern distinct from that 
of full-term infants when no expectation was present (control study [5]). However, an 
alternative explanation for negative BOLD responses is that these differences arise from 
changes in baseline (e.g., [25]). In this case, a response to baseline stimuli in preterm infants 
could be elevated when compared to the full-term baseline. As all responses are recorded 
relative to baseline, an elevated baseline response would explain the smaller visually-evoked 
response to the audiovisual trials and could also explain a significant reduction to the 
unexpected visual omission trials. In the Supplemental Information, we conduct a baseline 
correction which equates the level of neural response in the occipital ROI to the audiovisual 
trials across preterm and full-term infants and find the same effects across trial type and 
group.

 There are No Differences Across Levels of Prematurity
Preterm infants in this study were born from 23 to 32 weeks gestation. While all of these 
infants were born before the third trimester, the level of neural maturity at birth varied 
widely across this sample. Moreover, many risk factors for prematurity are much more 
severe or are restricted to infants born extremely premature (<28 weeks, [26, 27]). We 
investigated whether the deficits we have observed are modulated by gestational age at birth: 
Is there evidence for gradation in these deficits of top-down prediction across gestational age 
or are these deficits uniform across infants born before the third trimester? First, removing 
early preterm infants from our sample (gestational age less than 28 weeks) did not change 
the significance of any relevant statistical analysis. The remaining preterm infants showed 
significant occipital response during both audiovisual trials, t(33)=2.56, p=.01519, d=.02, 
and visual omission trials, t(33) = −2.57, p=.01487, d=.44, with a significantly negative 
response to the visual omission trials. There was still a significant difference in preterm 
occipital response between both trial types, t(33)=5.46, p<.001, d=.87, and a significant 
difference in occipital response during visual omission trials between preterm and full term 
infants, t(55.34)= −4.43, p<.001, d=1.04. The fact that our results withstood the exclusion of 
this group indicates that the effects observed are not driven by infants born very early, but 
rather are effects that may distinguish preterm infants in general from full-term infants. 
Since relatively few (n=9) infants fell into this early category, we do not have the statistical 
power to determine the specific influence of these extremely premature infants on our 
analysis. We also considered whether gestational age has a more subtle but graded effect on 
differences of responses to unexpected visual omissions. As Figure 3 illustrates, gestational 
age, within the preterm sample, does not account for variation in the neural response to 
visual omissions, R2=.01, F(1,41)=.47, p=.4949. Importantly, we also do not find that 
gestational age within the preterm sample explains occipital lobe responses to audiovisual 
trials when a visual stimulus is presented, R2=.01, F(1,41)=.56, p=.4581. Future work will 
address this surprising finding: Is there is a categorical shift in early top-down prediction 
abilities after the first trimester as the current data suggests or would a sample including 
more infants born extremely premature will reveal gradations in this ability?
Socioeconomic Status and other Demographic Differences Do Not Explain The Effects of 
Prematurity
In addition to prematurity, there are a number of demographic differences between our 
groups. Notably, our preterm sample has a lower socioeconomic status and were much more 
likely to have come from multiple births (e.g., twins, triplets). Importantly, additional 
analyses confirm that the deficits in top-down, sensory prediction observed across these 
groups are not explained by these other demographic differences. See Supplemental 
Information for more details.
Preterm and Full-Term Infants Equally Detect Visual Omissions
We find that infants born prematurely exhibit a significant reduction in the neural signature 
of top-down prediction. An alternate explanation of this result is simply that the unexpected 
visual omission is less unexpected to preterm infants. This could arise, for example, from 
reductions in cross-modal associative learning [28]. If preterm infants are slower to learn the

 cross-modal association between the sound and the visual event, that could explain the lack 
of occipital response to the visual omission trials. The current study was carefully designed 
to avoid this possibility (e.g., provide infants with an equal amount of exposure to the stimuli 
in a paradigm that reduces learning-demands through temporal overlap between audio and 
visual stimuli). Moreover, Emberson et al (2015) [5] examined neural responses to visual 
omissions for a control group of full-term infants who did not learn the AV association and 
found that the occipital lobe did not respond differently from baseline, in contrast to the 
strong negative response observed in the occipital lobe for preterm infants. While predictive 
processes are well-established to be involved in reinforcement learning, the nature of these 
signals is distinct from the type of prediction being studied here. Specifically, prediction 
errors involved in reinforcement learning are found in the basal ganglia and other subcortical 
circuitry [29, 30, 31]. This type of prediction is well-reflective of a feedforward system 
where this subcortical circuitry modulates expectations based on sensory input that 
continues on to modulate motor responses. By contrast, the current study investigates top-
down prediction of sensory input that modulates perceptual cortices [22, 32]. Top-down, 
sensory prediction is a distinct but complementary type of prediction which relies on the 
formation of an association (in the case of the current study) as an origin for a feedback 
signal that affects the perceptual cortices. Thus, while associative or reinforcement learning 
is likely involved in the current study, we aim to isolate the effects of prematurity to top-
down prediction signals and not differences in associative learning which can rely on a 
largely feedforward network architecture.
To confirm that preterm and full-term infants detect visual omissions similarly, we 
conducted a behavioral, control experiment. A new sample of 50 full-term and 50 preterm 
infants were recruited using the same methods and populations as the fNIRS study. 
Specifically, we asked whether the exposure that infants received in the fNIRS study would 
result in a similar looking-time preference to visual omissions for preterm and full-term 
infants. Systematic looking preferences are canonically interpreted in relation to the strength 
of internal representations [33]. Thus, similar looking-time preferences would suggest that 
preterm and full-term infants detect the visual omission equally. After exposure to 
audiovisual pairs in a similar exposure to the fNIRS experiment, infants were presented with 
sequences of familiar audiovisual trials in counterbalanced order with sequences that 
contained 50% visual omission trials. We find strikingly similar looking-time preferences 
across the two groups. Indeed, direct comparisons between the groups yielded no significant 
difference (see Figure 4 and the Supplemental Information for full experimental details). 
This control experiment confirms that there are no differences in detection of the visual 
omission trials across the two groups. This finding suggests that the differences between 
preterm and full-term infants are specific to top-down, sensory prediction and are not arising 
from differences in foundations necessary to this task.
Why does being born prematurely disrupt the underlying neural mechanisms of top-down 
prediction? Having established that detecting visual omissions, medical complications and 
SES don’t explain these deficits, one possibility is that preterm infants early extrauterine 
negatively affects the development of this ability. Specifically, extrauterine experience is rich 
endowed with a myriad of patterns and statistical information that preterm infants receive 
well before full-term infants and during the third trimester which is crucial for neural

 development (e.g., the development of long-range functional connectivity[34]). Receiving 
this experience too early may be detrimental because the developing brain is not ready for 
the input (e.g., neural connectivity is limited which could prevent or bias learning). Another 
possibility, not mutually exclusive, is that the type of extrauterine experience that preterm 
infants receive is importantly different from full-term infants (e.g., due to necessary medical 
interventions). Numerous studies have investigated preterm infants with the goal of 
determining whether development of different abilities is supported by experience or neural 
maturation. In contrast to the current study and the large literature documenting the 
developmental difficulties associated with prematurity, many of these studies have 
concluded that preterm infants are relatively unimpaired or even accelerated in their 
development(e.g., [35, 36, 37]). It may be that relatively low-level, early developing abilities 
are not disrupted by premature birth, but the disruption of foundational developmental 
mechanisms, as reported here, has developmental consequences that emerge later in life or in 
different domains.
In sum, we investigated neural signatures of top-down, sensory prediction in young infants 
who are at-risk for poor developmental outcomes due to premature birth. In comparison to 
their full-term peers, preterm infants exhibit typical neural responses to presented auditory 
and visual stimuli, but show substantially reduced neural responses to predicted visual 
stimuli. Moreover, these neural differences are present before infants have missed any 
clinically apparent developmental milestones suggesting that alterations in top-down, 
sensory prediction could give rise to the developmental impairments that preterm infants 
experience but that are revealed months and years later (e.g., language delays, learning 
disabilities). This result dovetails with the finding that premature birth affects information 
processing and memory that predict cognitive outcomes later in life [38, 39, 40]. Overall, 
this work provides evidence that top-down prediction is part of the engine driving 
development and an important component of how the infant brain uses experience to mature. 
If being born prematurely affects the mechanisms by which development proceeds, as this 
work suggests, this would explain why the effects of prematurity are ongoing and 
compounding [14]. Moreover, this discovery presents an opportunity for establishing a 
neuro-biomarker to identify infants at-risk and for guiding early intervention attempts once it 
has been established that these early life deficits predict poor developmental outcomes.

 Figure 1. 
Task Structure and MR-coregistration of fNIRS recordings Left: Overview of task structure. 
All trials began with a predictive sound/auditory stimulus. For the majority of the time, this 
was followed by the predicted visual stimulus (audiovisual trials, right branch). However, in 
a minority of the trials (20% of trials after initial familiarization), this predictive sound was 
followed by an unexpected omission of the visual stimulus (visual omission trial, left 
branch). Right: MR-coregistration of fNIRS recordings was used to create two neuro-
anatomically defined regions of interest (ROIs): temporal and occipital lobe ROIs (left and 
right panels respectively).

Neural activation in temporal and occipital lobes Mean levels of oxygenated hemoglobin 
(relative to baseline) during audiovisual and visual omission trials in (left to right) temporal 
lobe and occipital lobe. See Figures S1 for histograms of the key effects, S2–S3 for baseline 
corrections of the premature infant neural responses, S5 for the spatial distribution of this 
effect across channels in the occipital lobe.

 Figure 3. 
Gestational age versus top-down sensory prediction Oxygenated hemoglobin is not an 
absolute measure but relative to changes from baseline. Linear fit to preterm data is shown. 
See Figure S4 for relationship of gestational age and occipital lobe responses in audiovisual 
trials. See also Table S1.
