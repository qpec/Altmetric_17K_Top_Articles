IMPORTANCE Heart disease (HD) and cancer are the 2 leading causes of death in the United
States. During the first decade of the 21st century, HD mortality declined at a much greater
rate than cancer mortality and it appeared that cancer would overtake HD as the leading
cause of death.
OBJECTIVES To determine whether changes in national trends had occurred in recent years in
mortality rates due to all cardiovascular disease (CVD), HD, stroke, and cancer and to evaluate
the gap between mortality rates from HD and cancer.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
Wide-Ranging Online Data for Epidemiologic Research data system was used to determine
national trends in age-adjusted mortality rates due to all CVD, HD, stroke, and cancer from
January 1, 2000, to December 31, 2011, and January 1, 2011, to December 31, 2014, overall, by
sex, and by race/ethnicity. The present study was conducted from December 30, 2105, to
January 18, 2016.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Comparison of annual rates of change and trend in gap
between HD and cancer mortality rates.
RESULTS The rate of the decline in all CVD, HD, and stroke mortality decelerated substantially
after 2011, and the rate of decline for cancer mortality remained relatively stable. Reported as
percentage (95% CI), the annual rates of decline for 2000-2011 were 3.79% (3.61% to
3.97%), 3.69% (3.51% to 3.87%), 4.53% (4.34% to 4.72%), and 1.49% (1.37% to 1.60%) for
all CVD, HD, stroke, and cancer mortality, respectively; the rates for 2011-2014 were 0.65%
(−0.18% to 1.47%), 0.76% (−0.06% to 1.58%), 0.37% (−0.53% to 1.27%), and 1.55% (1.07%
to 2.04%), respectively. Deceleration of the decline in all CVD mortality rates occurred in
males, females, and all race/ethnicity groups. For example, the annual rates of decline for
total CVD mortality for 2000-2011 were 3.69% (3.48% to 3.89%) for males and 3.98%
(3.81% to 4.14%) for females; for 2011-2014, the rates were 0.23% (−0.71% to 1.16%) and
1.17% (0.41% to 1.93%), respectively. The gap between HD and cancer mortality persisted.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Deceleration in the decline of all CVD, HD, and stroke
mortality rates has occurred since 2011. If this trend continues, strategic goals for lowering
the burden of CVD set by the American Heart Association and the Million Hearts Initiative
may not be reached.

W
ith the exception of the flu pandemic years of 1918-
1920, heart disease (HD) has been the leading cause
of death in the United States since 1910,1 with can-
cer and stroke among the 5 leading causes of death every year
since 1924.2 From 2000 to 2010, age-adjusted mortality de-
creased 30% for HD and 36% for stroke, but cancer mortality
declined only 13%.3 Heart disease mortality approached that
of cancer, suggesting that cancer might soon replace HD as the
leading cause of death.
The decrease in HD mortality in the United States has been
attributed to expanded use of evidence-based medical thera-
pies as well as changes in risk factors and lifestyle modifica-
tions at a population level.4,5 Longstanding emphasis on car-
diovascular disease (CVD) prevention has led to a concept of
cardiovascular health.6 The American Heart Association has
a strategic goal of improving the cardiovascular health of all
Americans by 20% while reducing deaths from CVD and stroke
by 20% from 2010 to 2020.7 The Million Hearts Initiative was
announced in 2011, with the goal of preventing 1 million myo-
cardial infarctions and strokes by 2017.8
We evaluated the most recent trends in mortality attrib-
uted to all CVD, HD, stroke, and cancer from 2000 to 2014 to
gauge whether there have been any recent changes in the pat-
tern of decline in all CVD mortality and to assess trends in the
gap between HD and cancer mortality.
Methods
Mortality
Mortality rates throughout the United States for 2000-2014
wereascertainedusingtheCentersforDiseaseControlandPre-
vention’s Wide-Ranging Online Data for Epidemiologic Re-
search data set, which includes the assigned cause of death
from all death certificates filed in the 50 states and the Dis-
trict of Columbia.9 Categorization of the presumed underly-
ing cause of death used International Statistical Classification
of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Edition codes
as follows: all CVD (codes I00-I99), HD (codes I00-I09, I11, I13,
and I20-I51), cerebrovascular disease (codes I60-I69), and can-
cer (malignant neoplasms [codes C00-C97]). Based on the Na-
tional Human Subjects Protection Advisory Committee's rec-
ommendations, this study did not require institutional review
board approval because it analyzes government-issued pub-
lic use data without individual identifiable information. The
presentstudywasconductedfromDecember30,2105,toJanu-
ary 18, 2016.
Statistical Analysis
Mortality rates were age-adjusted using the direct method,
with the 2000 US Census10 as the standard population,
using the following age categorization: younger than 1 year, 1
to 4, 5 to 14, 15 to 24, 25 to 34, 35 to 44, 45 to 54, 55 to 64, 65
to 74, 75 to 84, and 85 years or older. Poisson regression
(with allowance for overdispersion, ie, variance > mean) was
used for point and interval estimation of age-adjusted
annual rates of change for January 1, 2000, to December 31,
2011, and January 1, 2011, to December 31, 2014, by fitting a
piecewise linear spline for the 2 calendar time intervals,
with a Wald test of the difference in rates (slopes).
Results
All CVD Mortality
Age-adjusted mortality rates declined from 2000 to 2014 for
all CVD (341.3 in 2000 vs 219.9 in 2014; rate decline of 35.6%),
HD (257.6 vs 167.0; rate decline of 35.2%), and stroke (60.9 vs
36.5; rate decline of 40.1%) (Table 1 and Figure, A). There was
adeflectionpointinthesetrendsin2011,withsubstantialslow-
ing in the decline from 2011 to 2014 (Table 2). From 2000 to
2011, the mean annual age-adjusted rate (percentage [95% CI])
of decline was 3.79% (3.61% to 3.97%) for all CVD, 3.69% (3.51%
to 3.87%) for HD, and 4.53% (4.34% to 4.72%) for stroke; from
2011to2014,therespectiveratesofdeclinewere0.65%(−0.18%
to 1.47%), 0.76% (−0.06% to 1.58%), and 0.37% (−0.53% to
1.27%) (Table 2). The US population and the total number of
all CVD, HD, and stroke deaths increased from 2011 to 2014,
withresultantslightlyhighercrudemortalityratesin2014com-
pared with 2011 for all CVD (253.3 vs 251.4 per 100 000 person-
years),HD(192.7vs191.5per100 000person-years),andstroke
(41.7 vs 41.4 per 100 000 person-years).
Sex and Race/Ethnicity
Males had higher mortality rates than females for all condi-
tions throughout the period (eTable 1 and eTable 2 in the
Supplement and Figure, B and C). The annual rates (percent-
age [95% CI]) of decline of all CVD changed from 3.98% (3.81%
to 4.14%) for females and 3.69% (3.48% to 3.89%) for males
during 2000-2011 to 1.17% (0.41% to 1.93%) and 0.23% (−0.71%
to 1.16%), respectively, during 2011-2014 (Table 2). Similar
changes were evident for HD and stroke mortality.
Non-Hispanic (NH) blacks had the highest mortality for all
CVD and HD in all years, followed by NH whites, NH Ameri-
can Indian/Alaskan Natives, Hispanics, and NH Asian/Pacific
Islanders (Figure, D-F, and eFigure and eTables 3-7 in the
Supplement). Each of the racial/ethnic groups, except NH
American Indian/Alaskan Native, had significant differences
in the annual change in mortality rates for all CVD, HD, and
stroke between 2000-2011 and 2011-2014 (Table 2).
Key Points
Question Are there changes in national trends in recent years in
mortality rates due to cardiovascular disease (CVD), heart disease
(HD), stroke, and cancer?
Findings The rate of decline in all CVD, HD, and stroke mortality
decelerated substantially after 2011. Deceleration of the decline in
all CVD mortality rates occurred in males, females, and all
race/ethnicity groups, and the gap between HD and cancer
mortality persisted.
Meaning If this deceleration trend continues, strategic goals for
lowering the burden of CVD set by the American Heart Association
and the Million Hearts Initiative may not be reached.

Cancer Mortality and Gap Between HD and Cancer Mortality
The overall decline in cancer mortality nationally was 19.2%
between 2000 and 2014 (199.6 vs 161.2), and the annual rate
of change was not significantly different in 2011-2014 com-
pared with 2000-2011. The gap between HD and cancer mor-
tality rates has remained essentially unchanged since 2011
(Table 1 and Figure, A).
Discussion
The rates of decline of all CVD, HD, and stroke decelerated dra-
matically between 2011 and 2014. If the rates of decline from
2000 to 2011 had persisted, HD mortality in the United States
would have been below that of cancer mortality in 2013, but
the pattern of HD and cancer being the first and second lead-
ing causes of death, respectively, has endured.11
Nationally, chronic diseases are the primary causes of dis-
abilityanddeath.12TheCentersforDiseaseControlandPreven-
tionadvocatesthatpublichealthandhealthcaresystemsdeploy

Ma et al15 found that HD and stroke declined more slowly
in the latter part of the 2000-2013 period, from a 3.9% annual
percentage change from 2000-2010 to 1.4% from 2010-2013
for HD and from 5.5% annual percentage change from 2001-
2007 to 3.0% in 2007-2013 for stroke, so that our findings may
represent a continuation of these trends to the point of near
stagnation.15 It is unknown whether small annual reduction
rates in HD and stroke mortality rates will persist. It is pos-
sible that the early part of the 21st century experienced a par-
ticularly high rate of decline in CVD mortality because of the
implementation of the prevention programs noted earlier and
that the decline might have slowed as implementation ap-
proached a saturation level in the community.
The use of the cardiopreventive medications (ie, aspirin
and statins) has increased in recent years. The percentage of
adults (age ≥18 years) reporting regular aspirin use increased
from 11.7% in 2005 to 19.0% in 2010,16 as assessed by the Na-
tionalHealthInterviewSurvey,17witha70%prevalenceoflow-
doseaspirinuseforsecondarypreventionofCVDnotedin2012.
Statinuseamongadults40yearsorolderincreasedfrom16.3%
in 2003-2004 to 23.2% in 2011-2012 based on National Health
and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data.18
The American Heart Association uses 7 metrics for the as-
sessment of cardiovascular health.19 Based on NHANES data,19
the percentage of adults achieving ideal cardiovascular health
for blood pressure, cholesterol, and smoking increased from
1999to2012;thepercentagemeetingideallevelsforbodymass
index and glucose decreased from 1999 to 2012; and the per-
centage meeting the ideal level for diet was near zero. The per-
centageofadultsmeetingidealcardiovascularhealthforphysi-
cal activity could not be compared over time because of
assessment method changes.
Based on NHANES data from 1988 to 2008,20 if current
trendscontinue,estimatedcardiovascularhealthisprojectedto
improve by 6% between 2010 and 2020, which is short of the
American Heart Association’s goal of 20% improvement.19 An-
ticipateddeclinesintheprevalenceofsmoking,highcholesterol
levels, and hypertension (in males) would be offset by substan-
tial increases in the prevalence of obesity and diabetes.20
A significant concern is the possibility that CVD mortality
rates stop decreasing and perhaps even increase, as sug-
gestedbyprovisionalestimatesthoughthethirdquarterof2015
of higher mortality rates than in 2014 for HD and stroke,21 in
part owing to the increasing prevalence of obesity and diabe-
tes at epidemic proportions.22,23 The NHANES estimate of the
prevalence of adult obesity increased from 22.9% in 1988-
1994 to 34.9% in 2011-2012,24,25 and the prevalence of diabe-
tes nearly tripled, from 2.5% in 1990 to 7.2% in 2013.26 An es-
timated 29 million US adults have diabetes.27
It is hoped that increased access to medical care and pre-
ventiveservicesresultingfromtheAffordableCareActwilllead
to improved cardiovascular outcomes. The health insurance
mandate of the Affordable Care Act has been associated with
a 30% decline in the percentage of uninsured adults from 17.1%
in the fourth quarter of 2013, just before the mandate began,
to 11.9% in the fourth quarter of 2015.28
The age-adjusted total CVD and stroke mortality rates
both declined by 6.6% from 2010 to 2014. Total CVD and
stroke mortality rates would need to decrease by more
than 2% annually—much higher than the recent rate of
decline—to achieve the American Heart Association’s 2020
goal of 20% reductions. The Million Hearts Initiative’s pri-
mary goal of preventing 1 million myocardial infarctions and
strokes cannot be measured, since we do not have adequate
data to estimate their incidence,29 but a leveling of the
decline in CVD mortality rates during the implementation of
the Million Hearts Initiative is inconsistent with achieve-
ment of its goal.
Conclusions
Given the high absolute burden and associated costs of HD and
stroke,19 continued vigilance and innovation are essential in
our efforts to address the ongoing challenge of CVD preven-
tion. However, the recent deceleration in the rate of decline
in HD mortality is alarming and warrants expanded innova-
tive efforts to improve population-level CVD prevention.

Slowing Progress in Cardiovascular Mortality Rates
You Reap What You Sow
Donald M. Lloyd-Jones, MD, ScM
Therearefewpublichealthsuccessstoriesgreaterthanthedra-
matic declines in cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality rates
achieved from about 1970 to 2010 in almost all Western coun-
tries. In many countries, age-
adjusted death rates fell 70%
or more during this period.
Driven by the critical obser-
vations of epidemiologic studies and by novel insights into car-
diovascular disease pathogenesis, there were major leaps for-
ward in our ability to prevent CVD events and prevent fatality
among those with acute CVD events such as myocardial in-
farction, stroke, and acute decompensated heart failure.
Therecognitionofcausalriskfactors,includingtobaccouse,
atherogeniccholesterolprofiles,elevatedbloodpressure,anddys-
glycemiaandtheirupstreamenablersofunhealthydietarypat-
terns and sedentary lifestyle, led to widespread public health
