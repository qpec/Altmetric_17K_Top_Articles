 ABSTRACT 
30 
Background: Little current evidence documents how internal medicine residents spend their time at work, 
31 
particularly regarding the proportions of time spent in direct patient care versus on computers.  
32 
Objective: To describe how residents allocate their during day and evening hospital shifts. 
33 
Design: Time-motion study. 
34 
Setting: Internal medicine residency at a university hospital in Switzerland May-July 2015. 
35 
Participants: 36 internal medicine residents with an average of 2.4 years of postgraduate training. 
36 
Measurements: Trained external observers recorded the residents’ activities using a tablet-based 
37 
application. Twenty-two activities were categorized as: directly related to patient; indirectly related to patient; 
38 
communication; academic; non-medical tasks; and transition activities. In addition, the presence of a patient 
39 
or colleague and use of computer or phone during each activity was recorded. 
40 
Results: Residents were observed for a total of 696.7 hours. Day shifts lasted 11.6 hours (1.6 hours more 
41 
than scheduled). During these day shifts, activities indirectly related to patients accounted for 52.4% of the 
42 
time; activities directly related to patients accounted for 28.0%; residents spent on average 1.7 hours with 
43 
patient, 5.2 hours with computer, and 13 min with both. Time dedicated to the computer was scattered during 
44 
day, with heaviest computer use after 6:00pm. 
45 
Limitations: Study involved a small sample from one institution. 
46 
Conclusion: At this Swiss teaching hospital internal medicine residents spend more time at work than 
47 
scheduled. The activities indirectly related to the patient predominate and about half of the work day is spent 
48 
with a computer.

 INTRODUCTION 
50 
The practice of hospital medicine is constantly evolving with the increasing complexity of patients (1-
51 
4). During their training, residents in internal medicine are educated to manage this complexity and to 
52 
summarize a wide array of medical information. The structure of a residents’ working day also dramatically 
53 
changed during the last decades, with limitation of working hours per week, a wide implementation of 
54 
electronic medical records (EMR), and a growing volume of clinical data and administrative tasks (5). Many 
55 
new scheduling paradigms have been proposed and implemented to address duty hours; these include the 
56 
separation of inpatient and outpatient rotations (mandatory clinics) (6) and the use of advanced practitioners 
57 
(nurse practitioners and physician assistants) (7) 
58 
Information technologies have been increasingly used in healthcare as they allow a better sharing 
59 
and availability of medical data. However, negative effects of the EMR have also been described, as their 
60 
implementation increases the time physicians spend on administrative tasks and writing notes (8). Similarly, 
61 
Alkureishi (9), Ratanawongsa (10) and Asaro (11) reported that EMR reduce communication and time spent 
62 
between patients and physician. Recently, Sinsky et al (12) described physician’s time allocation in 
63 
ambulatory practice and confirmed that they spend up to 50% of their time using EMR. 
64 
In hospital practice, only a small percentage (9 to 22%) of resident’s time is spent with patients, while 
65 
over half of it is dedicated to activities indirectly related to the patient (13-17). This trend is worrying, as less 
66 
time spent with patients decreases physician’s satisfaction (18), patient education and health promotion (19), 
67 
and increases inappropriate prescribing and medical malpractice (20). Even if information technologies are 
68 
improving, EMR still failed to fulfill their promises in today’s hospital practice (21). 
69 
Few time motion studies focused on how computer use impacts resident’s time allocation. We 
70 
therefore aimed to objectively assess the type and duration of the activities performed by hospital residents 
71 
along the day. The primary focus was to estimate the time spent with patients and to the computer. The 
72 
secondary focus was to identify any individual factor influencing the residents’ time allocation to the different 
73 
activities and contexts. 
 
74

 METHODS 
75 
Study Design, Setting and Participants 
76 
We conducted an observational study between May and July, 2015 at the department of internal 
77 
medicine of the Lausanne University Hospital, one of the five teaching hospitals in Switzerland, with over 
78 
1’471 beds and 47’300 patients hospitalized in 2015 (www.chuv.ch). The hospital implemented the current 
79 
EMR in 2009 (Soarian, Cerner Corporation, Kansas City, MO, USA). It compiles medical documentation, 
80 
labs, X-ray and providers’ views, electronic prescription system, and scanned medical archives. The EMR is 
81 
available on desktop and laptop computers. 
82 
The department of internal medicine receives approximately 6’200 patients per year and has 203 
83 
beds, organized in eight wards. Each is staffed with one senior physician and one chief resident supervising 
84 
three residents. Minimum postgraduate training for internal medicine is planned over five years: three years 
85 
of basic training mostly in internal medicine department and two additional years more freely organized in 
86 
specialties. At least six months have to be certified in an ambulatory practice. Chief residents have usually at 
87 
least four years of postgraduate training. Within each ward, a resident is responsible for six to ten patients. 
88 
There are day (08:00-18:00), evening (16:30-23:30) and night (22:30-08:30) shifts. Scheduling of the 
89 
residents’ daily activities is comparable to US hospitals (Figure 1): daily patients round, supervision, training 
90 
and patients’ new admissions. The staff is reduced to two residents and one chief resident (for 203 beds) 
91 
during evening and night shifts. Evening shifts relate mostly to late patients’ admissions, unstable patient care 
92 
and emergency situations. In this study, only day and evening shifts were considered. Night shifts were not 
93 
considered as activities are mostly limited to attending emergency situations. 
94 
All residents working on internal medicine inpatient wards - which do not cover any critical care or 
95 
specialty unit - during the study period were eligible for inclusion. There were no exclusion criteria. The 
96 
Human Research Ethics Committee of canton de Vaud certified that the study was exempt from human 
97 
subject’s ethics review. All residents were informed of the study and signed a written consent. No patient 
98 
identifier or health information was recorded. 
 
99

 Data collection procedure 
100 
Data collection was performed by undergraduate medical students. They were extensively trained to 
101 
collect data without interfering with resident’s work. The training consisted of a) a dedicated e-learning 
102 
program on how to categorize the various resident’s activities; b) a teaching session, focused on the 
103 
definition of activities and the use of recording device; c) a two hours practice session based on a one-hour 
104 
video of residents engaging in typical medical activities; d) eight hours of observation and recording of a 
105 
resident’s activity on the wards (the resulting data was not included in the study), and e) a last session to 
106 
solve any remaining issues. The reproducibility of the observers was assessed during the one-hour video 
107 
practice; overall, observers recorded activities and contexts similarly (Appendix Table 1). 
108 
Recording began upon arrival of the resident at his workplace and lasted until he left. Residents were 
109 
randomly assigned to an observer. To decrease observation bias, observers had to avoid communicating 
110 
with the residents and were only allowed to ask for clarification about an activity or context (see below). To 
111 
optimize observation accuracy, day shifts were sequentially covered by two observers, with handover after 
112 
the first 6 hours. Evening shifts were covered by only one observer as evening shifts were shorter. 
113 
Each activity was recorded in real-time, using a tablet (Appendix Figure 1). The application was 
114 
designed by the investigators and developed with the IT department of the hospital. To promote similar 
115 
studies, the source code is available “as is” on github.com. The observer selected an activity and/or a 
116 
context. After hitting a confirmation icon, the application automatically recorded the starting time of the activity 
117 
or context being performed. Based on expertise and earlier studies (13-17, 22), we defined 22 exclusive 
118 
activities, grouped in six categories, as listed in Table 1. We created a specific category labeled 
119 
“communication” because we were interested in how much time was dedicated to news delivery (for e.g. bad 
120 
news, therapeutic orientation) and family meeting. Hence, our department is very keen about quality 
121 
development and has a particular interest in assessing resident's communication skills. Other types of 
122 
communication were collected in the category “directly related to the patient” within activities such as 
123 
admission, patient round, and patient discharge activities. Similarly, four contexts in which the activity was 
124 
being performed were created: 1) in presence of one or more colleagues (any professional); 2) in presence of 
125 
the patient; 3) with a computer, and 4) with a phone. Context could change irrespective to the activity being 
126 
performed. 
127 
 
5 
 For each resident, gender; age; country of medical graduation; postgraduate training (in months), and 
128 
distance between home and the hospital were collected. The number of patients the resident had in charge 
129 
during the observed shifts was also collected. 
130 
Statistical analysis 
131 
Based on similar studies (13-17), a pragmatic sample size of 64, corresponding to two shifts per 
132 
resident, was chosen. Statistics were performed using Stata 14.0 (Stata corp, College station, TX, USA). 
133 
Descriptive results for residents’ characteristics were presented as average (standard deviation) for 
134 
continuous data or as number of participants and (percentage) for categorical data. As residents could be 
135 
assessed several times on the same or on different shifts, we used a linear mixed model using resident as 
136 
cluster to compute means and corresponding 95% confidence intervals of the times dedicated to each 
137 
activity. We calculated the percentage of a resident's shift time devoted to a specific activity by dividing the 
138 
time for that activity divided by the total shift duration.  
139 
RESULTS 
140 
Thirty-six residents were included; 23 were women and their mean (SD) age was 29.4 (2.5) years 
141 
(range: 25.7-39.4). Thirteen (36%) residents held a foreign medical diploma. Average postgraduate training in 
142 
internal medicine was 29 (11) months (range: 0-50), and median distance between home and hospital was 
143 
3.0 km (range: 1.4-75.7). During day shifts, each resident was in charge of an average of eight patients. 
144 
Data from 66 shifts (49 days and 17 evenings) was collected, amounting to 696.7 hours of 
145 
observation. Because of external factors, i.e. residents’ holidays, 9 residents were observed only once. Table 
146 
1 shows the distribution of the 22 activities during day and evening shifts. Day shifts lasted for an average of 
147 
11.6 hours (95% CI 11.2 - 12.0). 52.4% of this time was dedicated to tasks indirectly related to patients and 
148 
only 28.0% to tasks directly related to patients. Academic, non-medical, transition and communication tasks 
149 
represented 6.3%, 6.1%, 5.1% and 2.3% of total time, respectively. Two of the longest activities (lasting >1 
150 
hour) were daily patient rounds and writing in the EMR. Evening shifts lasted for an average of 7.6 hours 
151 
(95% CI 7.0 - 8.2). Expressed as percentage of total time, the distribution of the main activities (i.e. directly or 
152 
indirectly related to the patient, communication, non-medical) were comparable between day and evening 
153 
shifts, except that academic activities were almost non-existent in evening shifts (Table 1). 
154 
 
6 
 For each category of activities, time spent by residents with patients, with the computer, with both 
155 
patients and the computer and neither patients nor computer is indicated in Table 2. During day shifts, 
156 
residents spent on average 1.7 hours (101 min) with patients, 5.2 hours (313 min) with computer, and 13 min 
157 
with both. For activities directly related to patients, residents in day shifts spent the same time with patients 
158 
and the computer, while residents in evening shifts spent longer time with the computer than with patients. 
159 
For activities indirectly related to the patient, computer use represented 59.2% of the time in day shifts and 
160 
42.3% in evening shifts. The distribution of time spent with patients or with the computer is shown in Figures 
161 
2a and 2b, respectively; time spent with patients was concentrated from 9:00 to 11:00 (Figure 2a), while time 
162 
spent with the computer was much more scattered, with higher percentages after 18:00 (day shifts) and 
163 
23:30 (evening shifts) (Figure 2b). 
164 
Overall residents spent 48.1% of their time in presence of colleague(s) during day shifts and 30.9% 
165 
during evening shifts. The usage of phone was similar during day and evening shifts, representing 9.4% of 
166 
the time. 
167 
DISCUSSION 
168 
This is the largest observational European study that objectively and comprehensively assessed the 
169 
organization of a resident’s workday in a hospital setting. Most of our findings are in accordance with the 
170 
literature (13-17): a majority of residents did not fulfill their duties in the scheduled time; activities indirectly 
171 
related to patients dominated, activities directly related to patients coming only second, and residents spent 
172 
almost three times more time with the computer than with patients. Finally, no consistent association was 
173 
found between residents’ personal characteristics and time dedicated to the different activities and contexts. 
174 
Most residents did not fulfill their duties in the scheduled time. Thus, day shifts lasted on average 1.6 
175 
hours more than the official 10 hours scheduled (Figures 1 and 2). Activity performed after hours were 
176 
mostly writing in EMR, a finding also reported in ambulatory practice (12). Almost two thirds of residents were 
177 
women, which might have an impact on duty hours in case women are working part-time. Still, in this study, 
178 
all residents assessed were working full-time, so we doubt that gender could have impacted duty hours.In a 
179 
recent survey conducted in Switzerland residents self-reported spending 27% of their time completing the 
180 
EMR and 29% with patients (23). Compared to our results, residents seem to overestimate the time they 
181 
 
7 
 dedicate to patients and underestimate the burden of computer work. This finding is of importance, because it 
182 
could mean that time motion studies are a better methodological approach to study how physicians allocate 
183 
their working time. 
184 
Overall, for one hour spent with patients, the residents spent an average of five hours performing 
185 
other tasks. For day shifts, writing in the medical record and writing the discharge letter/summary were the 
186 
most time-consuming activities, amounting to approximately two hours per shift. . 
187 
During day shifts, most of the time residents spent with patients corresponded to daily patient rounds 
188 
in the morning and admissions in the afternoon (Figure 2a). For evening shifts, the time spent with patients 
189 
was more evenly distributed, between late patients’ admissions, unstable patient care and solving urgent 
190 
situations. Residents spent roughly 14.6 minutes per patient per day, which is twice as long as reported by 
191 
Block et al. (7.7 min/patient/day) (13). One explanation is that US residents studied have a larger number of 
192 
patients to care for (25 patients (24) versus 8 in our study). However, the percentage of time spent with 
193 
patients was comparable between studies (16% in the present study versus 12% in the study of Block et al.). 
194 
Interestingly, compared with studies conducted in the US before the implementation of the EMR in 1994 (22), 
195 
1971 (25) and 1961 (26), residents in our study spent approximately the same proportion of time with 
196 
patients. Assuming that the amount of time with patients did not change substantially during the last decades, 
197 
the main change is how residents allocate their time to the other tasks. 
198 
Regarding the time spent for “communication” activities, time per shift was too short to draw any 
199 
conclusions, however residents did not use the computer when delivering news to patient or during meetings 
200 
with families. 
201 
Residents spend almost three times more time with the computer than with patients, a finding also 
202 
reported elsewhere (13-15, 17). However, until now, few time motion studies specifically focused on how, 
203 
when and why residents used a computer. A previous study concluded that residents spend considerably 
204 
more time interacting with computers (over 50% of their shift time) than in direct contact with patients (less 
205 
than 10% of their shift time) (15). However, generalization of these results is limited by the small number of 
206 
residents observed (seven) and the short observation time (84 hours overall, i.e. one shift per resident). 
207 
 
8 
 In the present study, time spent with the computer was evenly distributed during the day (Figure 2b), 
208 
contrary to time with patients, which was more clustered. During extra hours, time allocated to the computer 
209 
predominated, showing that residents postponed writing notes. Possible reasons include a better summing 
210 
up of the clinical issues encountered, not being interrupted and not needing to interact with other members of 
211 
the medical team. Even though residents could be simultaneously with the patient and with the computer, 
212 
they seldom did so. This attitude differs from the ambulatory setting, where physicians interacted with EMR 
213 
during one third of the time they spent with patients (12). This is likely due to hospital setting, which does not 
214 
facilitate the usage of the computer while interacting with the patient. Still, the large amount of time dedicated 
215 
to computer or other activities not centered on the patient could lead to dissatisfaction of residents due to the 
216 
limited medical value of such activities and could also increase the risk of burnout (27). Thus, our results 
217 
suggest the need to rethink residents’ work organization to fit the digital age (21). 
218 
Based on our results, several interventions targeting resident time allocation could be tested. Firstly, 
219 
increasing the ratio residents/patients could potentially limit the number of extra hours, but would be 
220 
prohibitive in many institutions and would also impact educational opportunities for the residents. Secondly, 
221 
the delegation of administrative tasks (~40 minutes/day in the present study) could allow residents to focus 
222 
on more valued medical activities. Thirdly, optimization of documentation supports, speech or writing 
223 
recognition systems, or medical assistants in charge of keying in the data into the EMR could decrease the 
224 
time residents spend writing in the EMR. Fourthly, continuous improvement of the ergonomics of EMR and 
225 
redefinition of the documentation procedures could reduce the time spent with the computer. Indeed, despite 
226 
many promises, EMR still fail to capture and synthesize the growing amount and complexity of clinical data 
227 
(21). Finally, the residents’ timetable and training should be adapted to the challenges of digital medicine 
228 
(28). 
229 
Compared to interview studies, time motion studies are the preferred methodological type of study to 
230 
assess physicians’ time allocation, because they allow an objective estimation of the time dedicated to each 
231 
activity and avoid recall bias. Further, our study is considerably larger by the number of residents or the 
232 
observation time than other studies using a similar method (12-16). To highlight this strength we summarized 
233 
the methods and findings of recently published studies assessing the allocation of time in hospital practice in 
234 
 
9 
 Appendix Table 2 summarizes. As performed in another study (12), we recorded separately activity from 
235 
context, which allows an accurate measure of time with the patient and with the computer. 
236 
This study also has several limitations. Firstly, it was performed in a single hospital, so results might 
237 
not be generalizable to other settings. Still, most published studies were also conducted in a single hospital, 
238 
and it would be of interest to replicate our study in other settings. Secondly, an observational bias (Hawthorne 
239 
effect) cannot be excluded, as residents knew they were being observed. Still, this bias is present in all 
240 
observational studies on the topic (12-17) and it is not possible to assess its direction, i.e. if residents 
241 
remained longer or left earlier. 
242 
In a hospital setting, residents in internal medicine fail to complete their duties in the scheduled shift. 
243 
The activities indirectly related to the patient predominate and about half of the work day is spent with the 
244 
computer, notably impacting the later hours. Organizational changes and EMR improvement are required to 
245 
increase efficiency and face high complex inpatient.
