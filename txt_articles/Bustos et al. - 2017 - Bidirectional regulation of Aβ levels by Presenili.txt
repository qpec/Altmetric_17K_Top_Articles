Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is characterized by accumulation of the
β-amyloid peptide (Aβ), which is generated through sequential pro-
teolysis of the amyloid precursor protein (APP), first by the action of
β-secretase, generating the β-C-terminal fragment (βCTF), and then by
the Presenilin 1 (PS1) enzyme in the γ-secretase complex, generating
Aβ. γ-Secretase is an intramembranous protein complex composed of
Aph1, Pen2, Nicastrin, and Presenilin 1. Although it has a central role
in the pathogenesis of AD, knowledge of the mechanisms that reg-
ulate PS1 function is limited. Here, we show that phosphorylation of
PS1 at Ser367 does not affect γ-secretase activity, but has a dramatic
effect on Aβ levels in vivo. We identified CK1γ2 as the endogenous
kinase responsible for the phosphorylation of PS1 at Ser367. Inhibi-
tion of CK1γ leads to a decrease in PS1 Ser367 phosphorylation and
an increase in Aβ levels in cultured cells. Transgenic mice in which
Ser367 of PS1 was mutated to Ala, show dramatic increases in Aβ
peptide and in βCTF levels in vivo. Finally, we show that this mutation
impairs the autophagic degradation of βCTF, resulting in its accumu-
lation and increased levels of Aβ peptide and plaque load in the brain.
Our results demonstrate that PS1 regulates Aβ levels by a unique
bifunctional mechanism. In addition to its known role as the catalytic
subunit of the γ-secretase complex, selective phosphorylation of PS1
on Ser367 also decreases Aβ levels by increasing βCTF degradation
through autophagy. Elucidation of the mechanism by which PS1 reg-
ulates βCTF degradation may aid in the development of potential
therapies for Alzheimer’s disease.
Presenilin 1 | phosphorylation | Alzheimer’s disease | Aβ | autophagy
A
lzheimer’s disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative
disorder characterized by the accumulation of Aβ plaques
and neurofibrillary tangles in the brain. Although the disease
etiology is not fully understood, patients with inherited early-onset
AD have mutations in genes involved in proteolytic generation of
Aβ, suggesting a key role for Aβ in disease pathogenesis (1).
Aβ is generated through sequential proteolysis of the amyloid
precursor protein (APP), first by β-secretase, producing βCTF,
and then by the γ-secretase complex, generating Aβ (2, 3). γ-Sec-
retase is an intramembranous aspartyl protease complex composed
of Aph1, Pen2, Nicastrin, and PS1 or PS2. The PS1 isoform has a
pivotal role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease. Although
knowledge of its regulation is limited, PS1 phosphorylation can
affect its function. For example, PS1 phosphorylation at Ser353
and Ser357 by GSK3β modulates its binding to β-catenin (4).
Phosphorylation of PS1 at Ser397 by GSK3β and at Thr354 by
P35/Cdk5 regulates PS1 C-terminal fragment stability (5). PS1
phosphorylation at Ser346 by PKC inhibits proteolytic processing
of PS1 by caspase activity, thereby reducing the progression of
apoptosis (6). Recently, phosphorylation of Ser19 in PS2 was
shown to regulate PS2 localization to the late endosome/lyso-
some (7). PS1 is also phosphorylated on its third intracellular
loop at Ser367 (8), but the consequences of this modification or
the responsible kinase are unknown.
Here, we report that PS1 phosphorylated at residue Ser367 de-
creases levels of βCTF, the precursor of Aβ, by increasing its deg-
radation through autophagy. We identified CK1γ as the endogenous
protein kinase responsible for phosphorylation of PS1 at Ser367.
Transgenic mice in which PS1-Ser367 was mutated to Ala showed
dramatic increases in the levels of βCTF and its proteolytic product,
Aβ, in vivo. The brains of PS1-S367A knock-in mice show increased
levels of LC3-II and SQSMT1/p62 proteins, indicating impaired
autophagic flux. We conclude that PS1 regulates Aβ levels in a bi-
directional manner. Thus, in addition to the known proamyloidogenic
role of PS1 as the catalytic subunit of the γ-secretase complex that
processes βCTF to produce Aβ, selective phosphorylation of PS1 on
Ser367 results in an antiamyloidogenic function that decreases
Aβ levels by increasing βCTF degradation through autophagy.
Results
CK1γ Phosphorylates PS1 at Ser367. We first identified the endoge-
nous kinase responsible for phosphorylating PS1 at Ser367. In silico
analysis indicated that Ser367 belongs to a conserved phosphory-
lation motif recognized by casein kinase 1 (CK1) (9), a protein ki-
nase family with six isoforms: CK1α, CK1γ1, CK1γ2, CK1γ3, CK1δ,
and CK1e. Using systematic knockdown of each CK1 isoform,
CK1γ2 was identified as the endogenous kinase most able to
phosphorylate PS1 at Ser367 (Fig. 1 A–C). To confirm these results,
we incubated N2A cells with CK1 inhibitors that targeted specific
isoforms. Treatment of N2A cells with 2-((4-(2-hydroxypropan-
2-yl)phenyl)amino)-1H-benzo[d]imidazole-6-carbonitrile (HPB), a re-
cently developed CK1γ inhibitor (10), led to a 57% decrease in PS1
pSer367 (Fig. 1 D and E). Additionally, overexpression of CK1γ2 in
mouse fibroblasts induced a 49% increase in phosphorylation of PS1
at Ser367 (Fig. 1 F and G).
Significance
Alzheimer’s disease is the most common neurodegenerative
disorder, affecting more than 5 million people in the United
States. Multiple lines of evidence suggest that the accumulation
of toxic oligomers and aggregates of β-amyloid (Aβ) peptide are
the primary causes of neurodegeneration. Aβ originates from
sequential cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein (APP). The
APP first cleavage is by β-secretase and yields β-C-terminal
fragment (βCTF). In turn, βCTF is cleaved by Presenilin 1 (PS1)
to produce Aβ. In this work, we show that PS1, in addition to
generating Aβ, can also decrease Aβ levels by directing βCTF
degradation through autophagy. This previously unrecognized
mechanism of regulation of Aβ by Presenilin 1 could provide an
attractive target for potential Alzheimer’s disease therapies.

 We next tested the effect of CK1γ inhibition on Aβ levels.
Treatment of N2A cells overexpressing APP with HPB induced a
56% increase in intracellular Aβ40 levels (Fig. 1H) and a 52%
increase in secreted Aβ40 levels (Fig. 1I). In addition, over-
expression of CK1γ2 in N2A695 cells induced a 33% decrease in
Aβ40 (Fig. 1 J and K), indicating that CK1γ2 activity helps
maintain low Aβ levels.
Phosphorylation of PS1 at Ser367 Regulates Aβ Levels in Vivo. To
determine whether phosphorylation of PS1-Ser367 affected Aβ
metabolism in vivo, we created knock-in transgenic mice where
phosphorylation of Ser367 was eliminated by mutation of this resi-
due to Ala (S367A). These mice were crossed with the J20 AD
mouse model, which overexpresses human APP containing three
mutations linked to familial AD (11). Levels of soluble and insoluble
Aβ40 and Aβ42 were each dramatically increased in brains of 9-mo-
old J20-S367A transgenic mice (Fig. 2 A–D). For example, J20-
S367A mice had a 40-fold increase in insoluble Aβ40 compared
with J20 mice (980 ± SD 338 ng/g of wet tissue versus 24 ± SD 5 ng/g
of wet tissue, respectively) (Fig. 2C). Immunostaining of brain slices
revealed a significant increase in amyloid plaques in the brains of
J20-S367A mice (Fig. 2 E and F). A transgenic mouse line where
PS1-Ser367 was mutated to the phosphomimetic Asp (J20-S367D)
accumulated the same amounts of Aβ species and amyloid plaques
as did J20-S367A (Fig. S1). This finding is consistent with some other
phosphomimetic mutants (12–14), in that this mutation did not
mimic phosphorylated Ser367, but behaved like the non-
phosphorylated PS1-S367A knock-in. We also measured endoge-
nous levels of soluble Aβ40 and Aβ42 in wild-type and PS1-S367A
knock-in mice, which express endogenous APP (Fig. 3 A and B). As
observed with the J20-PS1-S367A mice, there was an increase in
levels of Aβ40 and Aβ42. These data show that a mutation of
PS1-Ser367 to a nonphosphorylatable Ala induces an increase in
Aβ levels and amyloid plaque formation in vivo.
PS1-Ser367 Phosphorylation Does Not Affect γ-Secretase Activity.
Because PS1 is the subunit of the γ-secretase complex that pro-
teolytically catalyzes the formation of Aβ, the effect of the Ser367
phosphorylation on γ-secretase activity was assessed. For this pur-
pose, we analyzed γ-secretase activity in vitro by using recombinant
βCTF-Flag as a substrate and membranes from brains of wild-type
(WT) or S367A knock-in mice as a γ-secretase source. Neither the
Km nor Vmax for βCTF cleavage were affected by the mutation of
Ser367 (Fig. 4A). To confirm the phosphorylation of PS1 at
Ser367 in this assay, we developed an antibody that specifically
recognizes PS1 phosphorylated at Ser367 (pSer367), but does not
bind nonphosphorylated PS1, pSer365, or pSer366 (Fig. S2 A and
B). After incubation, samples were analyzed for the presence of
PS1-pSer367 by immunoblot. Phosphorylated PS1 was detected in
membranes from WT mice but not in those from S367A mice (Fig.
4B). In these conditions, the stoichiometry of phosphorylation of
PS1-Ser367 was 0.65 ± 0.15. WT or PS1-S367A mice expressed

 similar levels of PS1 (Fig. S3). We also analyzed γ-secretase activity
by evaluating its ability to bind to a γ-secretase activity-sensing
probe (15), which binds only to an active PS1 conformation.
Membranes from WT or PS1-S367A mutant mice were incubated
with a photoactivatable biotinylated probe. After photoactivation,
the reactants were incubated with agarose-streptavidin beads and
bound proteins were separated by SDS/polyacrylamide gel elec-
trophoresis (PAGE). The amount of PS1 captured by the beads, a
measure of γ-secretase in the active state, was determined by im-
munoblot (Fig. 4C). The results using this activity sensor confirmed
those of studies with the βCTF substrate: Mutation of PS1 at
Ser367 does not change γ-secretase activity in mouse brain. To
further investigate the cause of the dramatic increase in Aβ seen in
J20-PS1-S367A mice, we focused on mechanisms independent of
its γ-secretase activity.
To determine the effects of phosphorylation of PS1-Ser367 on
APP processing, we compared the levels of APP products in brains
from WT and PS1-S367A mice. The PS1-S367A mutation caused
a significant increase in βCTF levels in vivo (Fig. 4 D and E), but
did not affect the levels of αCTF (Fig. 4 D and F), soluble APPβ
(sAPPβ) (Fig. 4 D and G), or full-length APP (Fig. 4D and H).
The lack of effect on sAPPβ suggests that the observed increase in
βCTF level was not due to increased BACE cleavage of APP. The
alternative, that reduced βCTF degradation accounts for the ac-
cumulation of βCTF and increased Aβ levels seen in the PS1-
S367A mutant mice, was next examined.
The mechanism of the increase in βCTF levels was first in-
vestigated in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) derived from
WT or S367A knock-in mice. To achieve high levels of βCTF
expression, we transfected these MEFs with APP harboring the
Swedish Alzheimer mutation (APPswe). Pulse–chase experiments
with [35S]Methionine indicate that in WT MEFs, the half-life of
βCTF was ∼50 min, whereas in MEFs derived from S367A mice, it
increased to more than 150 min (Fig. 4 I and J). These data in-
dicate that the phosphorylation of PS1 at Ser367 decreases the
half-life of βCTF by promoting its degradation through a mech-
anism independent of γ-secretase activity.
PS1 Regulates βCTF Degradation Through Autophagy. To explore the
proteolytic pathway involved in βCTF degradation, MEFs derived
from WT or PS1-S367A mice were transfected with APPswe, and
the autophagic pathway or the proteasome were chemically
inhibited. Autophagy inhibition led to an increase in βCTF levels
in WT MEFs, but it failed to increase βCTF levels in PS1-S367A
MEFs (Fig. 5A). Previously, we and others have reported that
βCTF is degraded through autophagy (16–18), a sequential pro-
cess that leads to lysosomal degradation of cellular components.
To further explore a potential relationship between PS1 and
autophagy, the levels of the LC3 protein, a marker of autophagic
flux, were examined. We observed an increase in LC3-II levels in
S367A brains compared with WT brains (Fig. 5 B and C). LC3-II
levels can increase as a result of increased autophagy or its de-
creased lysosomal degradation. To differentiate between these two
possibilities, we examined the levels of SQSTM1/p62, a marker of
lysosomal protein degradation. We observed an increase similar to

 LC3-II in SQSTM1/p62 levels in S367A brains compared with WT
brains (Fig. 5 B and D). This increase was also seen in isolated
cultured cortical neurons (Fig. 5 E and F). The increase in the
levels of both LC3-II and SQSTM1/p62 suggests impaired auto-
phagic flux. To demonstrate the role of PS1 phosphorylation in
autophagic flux, MEF derived from WT or PS1-S367A knock-in
mice were transfected with GFP-RFP-LC3, and the colocalization
between GFP and RFP was measured in conditions of normal
media, without serum and without serum plus the lysosomal in-
hibitor, bafilomycin. The result demonstrates that phosphorylation
of PS1-Ser367 regulates autophagic flux (Fig. 5 G and H).
In summary, our results show that lack of PS1-Ser367 phos-
phorylation reduces autophagic flux, causing the accumulation of
βCTF, which in turn leads to increased Aβ levels.
Discussion
Presenilin 1 is an intramembrane protease, harboring the catalytic
site of the γ-secretase complex. Although PS1 has a central role in
the generation of β-amyloid, little is known about other possible
functions. Here, we describe a phosphorylation site on PS1 that
regulates autophagy and promotes the degradation of βCTF.
Mutation of the phosphorylatable Ser367 of PS1 to Ala led to a
dramatic increase in Aβ levels in vivo. Two independent assays
demonstrated that the Ser367 to Ala mutation did not modify
γ-secretase activity. Consistent with our results and conclusions,
others recently reported that 15 phosphorylation sites in PS1, in-
cluding Ser367, did not affect the assembly, maturation, and ac-
tivity of γ-secretase, using highly purified γ-secretase in an in vitro
assay (19).
Phosphomimetic mutations are commonly used to test the
functional consequences of protein phosphorylation. However, a
direct comparison between the phosphorylation mimics and the
corresponding phosphorylated form of the protein is rarely car-
ried out. Our in vivo studies demonstrate that the phosphomimic
S367D does not reproduce the effect of phosphorylation on Aβ
metabolism, indicating that the full charge and geometry of a
phosphate group is required for its effect.
Recently, it was reported that the PS1-S367D mutation induced
a closed conformation in cells, as was also seen in PS1 containing
familial Alzheimer’s disease mutations (20). The authors con-
cluded, based on the assumption that the Asp mutation mimics
phosphorylation, that phosphorylation at PS1-Ser367 was patho-
genic (21). In contrast, in our work, we have demonstrated that the
S367D mutation does not mimic PS1 phosphorylation because it
induces the same Aβ accumulation as the S367A mutation.
Therefore, we conclude that phosphorylation of PS1 at Ser367 is

 protective, a conclusion consistent with all of the other data in
this report.
Previously, our laboratory reported that CK1 epsilon increased
Aβ production. Here, we find that CK1γ2 appears to be the
physiological kinase phosphorylating PS1 at Ser367, suggesting
that different CK1 isoforms participate in Aβ metabolism (22).
The mechanism by which CK1 epsilon regulates Aβ metabolism
remains to be investigated.
In the PS1-S367A mutant line, we observed an accumulation of
βCTF without changes in the levels of total APP, sAPPβ, or αCTF.
The differential susceptibility of βCTF and αCTF to autophagic
degradation could be due to differences in their site of synthesis.
Although βCTF is synthesized in endosomes and autophagic
vesicles, αCTF synthesis occurs predominantly on the cell surface,
rendering it less prone to undergo autophagic degradation.
Recently, the effect of PS1 familial Alzheimer’s disease (FAD)
mutations on highly purified γ-secretase activity was reported (23).
Interestingly, many mutations, which have been shown to increase
the amount of Aβ peptides in vivo, were shown to decrease
γ-secretase activity in vitro. Further work should characterize the
impact of Presenilin 1 FAD mutations on PS1-Ser367 phosphor-
ylation and on the autophagic degradation of βCTF.
Our results demonstrate that PS1 regulates Aβ levels in a bi-
directional manner. Thus, in addition to its known role as the cat-
alytic subunit of the γ-secretase complex, through which it converts
βCTF to Aβ, selective phosphorylation of PS1 on Ser367 decreases
Aβ levels by increasing βCTF degradation through autophagy.
Elucidation of the mechanisms that regulate PS1 phosphorylation at
Ser367 should aid in the development of potential therapies for
Alzheimer’s disease.
Methods
In Vitro Phosphorylation Assays. In vitro assays were performed in a final
volume of 50 μL in the following conditions: 50 mM Hepes pH 7.4, 150 mM
NaCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM [γ32P] ATP (1,000 cpm/pmol), 1 μg of GST-protein
or 1 μg of casein as a control, and 100 ng of protein kinase CK1γ (Sigma).
Reactions were performed at 30 °C for 10 min. Samples were analyzed by
SDS/PAGE and autoradiography.
Protein Quantification and Immunoblot Analysis. Cultured cells or brain tissues
were lysed in buffer A (50 mM Tris·HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, and 2 mM MgCl)
supplemented with 1% Triton X-100, a protease inhibitor mixture (Complete-
EDTA free; Roche) and phosphatase inhibitors (30 mM NaF, 1 mM orthovana-
date, and 30 mM pyrophosphate). The cell or tissue lysates were disrupted with a
probe-type sonicator for 10 s twice, centrifuged, and the protein levels in the
supernatant measured by the BCA method. For Aβ40, Aβ42, and sAPPβ, con-
ditioned cell culture media were analyzed. The samples were boiled in standard
protein sample buffer, and subjected to SDS/PAGE followed by protein transfer
onto a PVDF membrane and incubated overnight at 4 °C with the following
antibodies: anti-PS1 (mouse monoclonal, 1:1,000; EMD Millipore), anti-APP
(6E10, mouse monoclonal, 1:1,000; Covance) for total APP and βCTF, anti-actin
(rabbit polyclonal, 1:1,000; Santa Cruz), anti-LC3 (rabbit polyclonal, 1:1,000;
Sigma), anti-p62 (rabbit polyclonal, 1:500; Cell Signaling Technology),
anti-CK1γ2 (rabbit polyclonal 1:500; Abcam), anti–PS1-NTF (a polyclonal
antibody generated in our laboratory), and anti-sAPPβ (a polyclonal antibody
generated in our laboratory).
ELISA for Aβ. The quantitative analysis of Aβ40 or Aβ42 was performed by using
an ELISA kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Life Technologies).
Briefly, supernatants of conditioned media from N2A/APP695 cells were di-
luted in buffer and incubated in a 96-well plate with Aβ40 or Aβ42 antibody
for 3 h at room temperature. After washes of unbound material, a secondary
antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (HRP) was added for 30 min.
Unbound secondary antibody was washed, and subsequently samples were
incubated with a developing reagent for 30 min. Stop solution was added to
block further reaction between HRP and the colorimetric substrate. An ab-
sorbance multiplate reader was used to quantify the colorimetric reaction
at 450 nm.
Cell Culture and Transfection. Mouse N2A neuroblastoma WT cells and an
established N2A cell line expressing APP695 were maintained in medium
containing 50% DMEM and 50% Opti-MEM, supplemented with 5% FBS and
200 μg/mL G418 (Life Technologies). These cells line were tested for

Autophagy is regulated by the phosphorylation of PS1 at Ser367. (A) MEFs derived from WT or PS1-S367A were transfected with APPswe. In Upper,
autophagy was inhibited by incubating with 10 nM Bafilomycin a1 for 3 h. In Lower, the proteasome was inhibited by incubating with 10 μM MG132 for 8 h.
Cell lysates were immunoblotted with the 6E10 antibody to detect βCTF. (B–D) LC3-II and SQSMT1/p62 levels were elevated in the brains of S367A knock-in
mice compared with WT mice as measured by analysis of immunoblots. In B, results from three different WT and S367A mutant mice are shown. (E) Im-

 mycoplasma contamination by using LookOut mycoplasma PCR detection
(Sigma). Transient transfection of plasmid encoding CK1γ2 or APPsw was
performed by using FuGENE 6 (Roche) or Lipofectamine 2000 (Life Tech-
nologies). Compound HPB (5 μM, synthesized in house following the
methodology described in ref. 10), β-secretase inhibitor IV (10 μM), and
γ-secretase inhibitor DAPT (5 μM) were incubated for the indicated times.
In Vitro γ-Secretase Assay. Membranes containing γ-secretase were prepared
from brains of WT, S367A, or S367D mice and solubilized in 2% CHAPSO.
γ-Secretase membranes were incubated with substrate βCTF-FLAG for 90 min,
and Aβ40 levels were measured by ELISA.
Brain Aβ Measurement. For the analysis of mouse brains, mice were eutha-
nized by CO2 followed by decapitation. Brains were removed and frozen on
dry ice and stored at −80 °C until use. Half brains were homogenized in TBS
containing protease inhibitor mixture (Roche). The homogenized brains
were centrifuged at 300,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatants were used to
measure the levels of soluble Aβ40 and Aβ42. The pellets were suspended in
70% formic acid and sonicated for 30 s. The samples were neutralized in
10 volumes of neutralization buffer (1 M Tris-base, 0.5 M Na2HPO4, 0.05%
NaN3 pH 9.0), and insoluble Aβ40 and Aβ42 were measured by ELISA.
Stoichiometry of Phosphorylation. The stoichiometry of phosphorylation was
determined by comparing PS1 phosphorylated at Ser367 from brain mem-
branes with phosphorylated recombinant PS1-third intracellular loop fused to
GST. To calculate the stoichiometry of phosphorylation of GST-PS1, 5.0 pmoles
of GST-PS1 were phosphorylated with 1.0 pmol of CK1γ2 in 50 mM Hepes (pH
7.4), 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 100 μM ATP, 1 μCi [γ-32P] ATP at 30 °C for
30 min. The phosphorylated GST-PS1 was separated by SDS/PAGE (10–20%
Tricine; Invitrogen). The total amount of GST-PS1 was quantified by SDS/PAGE
with Coomassie staining by using BSA as standard. Phosphate incorporation
was quantified by using a scintillation counter (Beckman LS6500). The stoi-
chiometry of GST-PS1 phosphorylation was calculated by 32P incorporation in
relation to total protein. By using phosphorylated GST-PS1 as a standard,
quantitative immunoblotting was performed for PS1 phosphorylated at
Ser367 from brain membranes.
Immunofluorescence. For immunofluorescence microscopy, cells were fixed in
4% paraformaldehyde or ice-cold methanol for 10 min, permeabilized in 0.2%
Triton in PBS (PBST), and blocked in 10% donkey serum for 1 h at room
temperature. Cells were then incubated with primary antibody overnight at
4 °C, washed five times in PBST, and incubated with secondary antibody for 1 h
at room temperature. Cells were mounted by using Vectashield mounting
medium with DAPI (Vector Laboratories) and analyzed by using a Zeiss
LSM710 laser confocal microscope.
Immunohistochemistry. The brains of 9-mo-old J20, J20-PS1-367A, or J20-PS1-
S367D mice were processed, embedded, and sectioned at 40 μm. For amyloid
plaque quantification, the blocks were serial sectioned across the whole
hippocampus, and every eighth section was used for staining (∼20 sections
per animal). Briefly, free-floating sections were incubated in 0.3% H2O2 for
15 min to block endogenous peroxidase activity, and then incubated in a
mouse-on-mouse (MOM) blocking reagent from the MOM immunode-
tection kit (Vector Laboratories) to block nonspecific binding, followed by
incubation in a MOM diluent containing 6E10 primary antibody at room
temperature for 30 min, then reacted with MOM biotinylated anti-mouse
IgG reagent (1:2,000) for 10 min. Antibody labeling was detected by using
Vectastatin ABC kit (Vector Laboratories). The amyloid plaque load density
in the cortex and the hippocampal region was manually counted by using
ImageJ software.
Animals. All procedures involving animals were approved by The Rockefeller
University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and were in ac-
cordance with the National Institutes of Health guidelines. J20 mice were
purchased from The Jackson Laboratory. PS1 S367A and PS1 S367D are
constitutive knock-ins in C57BL/6J mice and were generated by homolog
recombination targeting exon 10. We produced the progeny by using in vitro
fertilization and embryo transfer techniques to generate the number of
animals needed for the biochemical tests. Only male animals were used in
this study.
Statistical Analysis. The data are presented as means ± SEM. Unless otherwise
mentioned, the data are based on three independent experiments. The
significance level was determined by using a two-tailed Student’s t test, as
indicated in the figure legends. For analysis of the statistical signifi-
cance of differences between more than two groups, we performed
repeated measures one-way ANOVA tests with a 95% confidence in-
terval. All statistical analyses were performed by using GraphPad Prism
software. No randomization or blinding was used, and no animals were
excluded from analysis. Sample sizes were selected on the basis of
previous publications.
