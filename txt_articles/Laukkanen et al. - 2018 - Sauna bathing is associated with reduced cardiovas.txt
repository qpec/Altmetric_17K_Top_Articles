Abstract
Background: Previous evidence indicates that sauna bathing is related to a reduced risk of fatal cardiovascular
disease (CVD) events in men. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between sauna habits and
CVD mortality in men and women, and whether adding information on sauna habits to conventional cardiovascular
risk factors is associated with improvement in prediction of CVD mortality risk.
Methods: Sauna bathing habits were assessed at baseline in a sample of 1688 participants (mean age 63; range
53–74 years), of whom 51.4% were women. Multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) were calculated to investigate
the relationships of frequency and duration of sauna use with CVD mortality.
Results: A total of 181 fatal CVD events occurred during a median follow-up of 15.0 years (interquartile range, 14.
1–15.9). The risk of CVD mortality decreased linearly with increasing sauna sessions per week with no threshold
effect. In age- and sex-adjusted analysis, compared with participants who had one sauna bathing session per
week, HRs (95% CIs) for CVD mortality were 0.71 (0.52 to 0.98) and 0.30 (0.14 to 0.64) for participants with two to
three and four to seven sauna sessions per week, respectively. After adjustment for established CVD risk factors,
potential confounders including physical activity, socioeconomic status, and incident coronary heart disease, the
corresponding HRs (95% CIs) were 0.75 (0.52 to 1.08) and 0.23 (0.08 to 0.65), respectively. The duration of sauna
use (minutes per week) was inversely associated with CVD mortality in a continuous manner. Addition of information
on sauna bathing frequency to a CVD mortality risk prediction model containing established risk factors was associated
with a C-index change (0.0091; P = 0.010), difference in − 2 log likelihood (P = 0.019), and categorical net reclassification
improvement (4.14%; P = 0.004).
Conclusions: Higher frequency and duration of sauna bathing are each strongly, inversely, and independently
associated with fatal CVD events in middle-aged to elderly males and females. The frequency of sauna bathing
improves the prediction of the long-term risk for CVD mortality.

 Background
Sauna bathing, a form of passive heat therapy, is a trad-
itional activity in Finland and widely used for relaxation
purposes and is becoming increasingly common in many
other countries [1–4]. Emerging evidence suggests that
sauna bathing is linked with several health benefits, in-
cluding a reduction in the risk of high blood pressure or
hypertension [5, 6], stroke [7], neurocognitive diseases
[8], and pulmonary diseases [9–11]. Sauna bathing has
also been used in treating musculoskeletal pain [12, 13]
as well as chronic headache [14]. The beneficial effects
of sauna bathing on these adverse events have been
linked to its positive impact on circulatory and cardio-
vascular function. It has been suggested that regular heat
therapy may improve cardiovascular function via im-
proved endothelium-dependent dilatation, reduced arter-
ial stiffness, modulation of the autonomic nervous
system, and lowering of blood pressure [6, 15–18].
We have shown that having frequent sauna baths is
strongly associated with a reduced risk of fatal cardio-
vascular outcomes and all-cause mortality in a general
population sample of middle-aged men [19]. To our
knowledge, this is the only available study [19] on the
prospective association between sauna habits and the
risk of mortality outcomes. It is therefore unknown
whether the additional cardiovascular benefits of fre-
quent sauna bathing are also applicable to women and
older individuals. In addition, there is no data on the
associations of both weekly frequency and duration of
sauna bathing with a risk of cardiovascular disease
(CVD) in populations including men and women. Fur-
thermore, given the strong independent association
between sauna bathing and the risk of CVD, there is a
possibility that adding information on sauna bathing
habits to current CVD risk prediction algorithms might
be associated with improvements in the ability to predict
CVD risk. The potential utility of sauna bathing for
CVD risk assessment has not yet been evaluated, and
therefore, this warrants investigation. In this context, we
aimed to evaluate the relationship between sauna bath-
ing habits (both frequency and duration) and the risk of
CVD mortality in a large population-based cohort of
middle-aged to elderly men and women. We also inves-
tigated the extent to which information on sauna habits
could improve the prediction of CVD mortality in our
study population using measures of risk discrimination
and reclassification.
Methods
Study design
We employed the Kuopio Ischaemic Heart Disease
(KIHD) Study, which is a population-based prospective
cohort study designed to investigate sauna bathing habits
and other risk factors for CVD [19, 20]. The KIHD Study
was initially based on a cohort of men aged 42–61 years
who were living in Kuopio and the surrounding rural
communities in the east of Finland. In the 11-year
follow-up visit of the first cohort, women were invited to
join this study. In this cohort which is being utilized for
this analysis, participants (n = 2358) comprised a ran-
domly selected sample of 1351 women and 1007 men
aged 53.4 to 73.8 years. Of 2072 eligible participants, 1774
participated in the current prospective sauna study. We
excluded 31 participants without information on assess-
ment of sauna bathing habits at baseline examination. Of
the remaining participants, complete data on sauna bath-
ing, clinical characteristics, biomarkers, and fatal CVD
outcomes were available for 1688 participants (867
women and 821 men) (Fig. 1). All baseline examinations
were carried out between March 1998 and December
2001. This study was performed following the STROBE
(STrengthening the Reporting of OBservational studies in
Epidemiology) guidelines for reporting observational stud-
ies in epidemiology (Additional file 1: Appendix) [21].
Assessment of sauna bathing
In a traditional Finnish sauna, there is dry air with a rela-
tive humidity of about 10–20%. It is possible to increase
the humidity temporarily by throwing water on the hot
rocks of the sauna heater, although it usually remains
below 20%. The recommended temperature for sauna is
from 80 to 100 °C at the level of the bather’s head, but the
temperature is much lower at the floor level (about 30 °C)
which keeps the ventilation of the sauna room efficient
and sauna condition comfortable for sauna bathers [5].
The duration of stay in the sauna room depends on the
comfort and temperature of the sauna bather, but it usu-
ally ranges from 5 to 20 min, although the sessions could
be longer depending on the individual [22]. In the current
study, sauna bathing was assessed at baseline by a
self-administrated questionnaire based on weekly sauna
sessions, duration, and temperature in the sauna room
[19]. The assessment represents a typical sauna use during
the week, and the temperature in the sauna room was
measured using a thermometer. The questionnaires were
checked by an experienced nurse at the time of baseline
examination.
Assessment of risk factors and baseline characteristics
Risk factors and all other characteristics were assessed
during the same visit at study entry. Baseline demo-
graphics and socioeconomic and living condition charac-
teristics were assessed among the study participants. A
participant who had ever smoked on a regular basis was
defined as a smoker. The use of medications, baseline
diseases, the level of physical activity, and socioeconomic
status (SES) were assessed by self-administered question-
naires [23]. The total and energy expenditure of physical

 activity was assessed from a validated 12-month leisure
time physical activity questionnaire [24, 25]. This de-
tailed quantitative questionnaire deals with the most
common leisure time physical activities of middle-aged
Finnish men. For the type of physical activity performed,
participants were asked to document the frequency
(number of sessions per month), average duration (hours
and minutes per session), and intensity [26]. Energy
expenditure was measured for each physical activity by
multiplying the metabolic index of activity (in metabolic
equivalent × hour/week) by body weight in kilograms.
The diagnosis of chronic diseases and medication was
assessed during a medical examination by a doctor.
Alcohol consumption was assessed using the Nordic
Alcohol Consumption Inventory [27]. Dietary energy
intake was assessed using 4-day food recording (Nutri-
cia); instructions were given, and completed food re-
cords were checked by a nutritionist. Resting blood
pressure was measured between 8 and 10 a.m. with a
random-zero
sphygmomanometer.
Participants
were
instructed to fast overnight, abstain from alcohol con-
sumption for at least 3 days, and to keep away from
smoking for at least 12 h prior to blood specimen collec-
tion. The cholesterol contents of serum lipoprotein frac-
tions and triglycerides were measured enzymatically
(Boehringer Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany). Serum
high-density lipoprotein and its subfractions were sepa-
rated from fresh serum samples using ultracentrifugation
and precipitation. Body mass index (BMI) was computed
as the ratio of weight in kilograms to the square of
height in meters.
Ascertainment of outcomes
All CVD deaths that occurred by the end of 2015 were
checked against the hospital documents, health center
wards and death certificates, and medico-legal reports
[28]. There were no losses to follow-up. All participants
(just like every individual in Finland) have personal iden-
tity codes which are annually matched through comput-
erized
linkage
with
registries
for
hospitalizations,
discharges, and deaths. Annual follow-up for outcomes
is also done automatically using the personal identifiers.
Registries are also regularly linked with the Central
Population Register to ensure that the personal identity
codes are correct. Cardiovascular disease deaths were
coded using the Tenth International Classification of
Diseases codes. Data on incident coronary heart disease
(CHD) events from the beginning of the study were
based on the national discharge registers [23]. The docu-
ments related to the death were cross-checked in detail
by two physicians.
Statistical analysis
Differences in baseline characteristics were examined
using the analysis of variance, the independent samples t
test, and the chi-squared test. Descriptive data are pre-
sented as means (standard deviation, SD) and percent-
ages. Hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals
(CIs) for CVD mortality were calculated using Cox pro-
portional hazard models after confirming the assump-
tions of the proportionality of hazards using Schoenfeld
residuals [29]. Subjects were classified into groups on
the basis of frequency of sauna bathing (1, 2–3, and 4–7

to
maintain
consistency with previous reports [6, 8, 19, 30]. In a sub-
sidiary analysis, we categorized frequency of sauna bath-
ing into 0–1, 2–3, and 4–7 times per week, including
participants who did not use sauna at all (n = 43). Haz-
ard ratios of the associations of frequency and duration
of sauna bathing with CVD mortality were progressively
adjusted for age and gender (model 1); BMI, smoking,
systolic blood pressure (SBP), serum low-density lipo-
protein cholesterol (LDL-C), alcohol consumption, pre-
vious myocardial infarction, and type 2 diabetes (model
2); total duration of physical activity per week and SES
(model 3); and incident CHD events as a time-varying
covariate (model 4), as it is a known factor in the path-
way for development of CVD mortality. Covariates were
selected on the basis of their previously established
roles as well-defined predictive or confounding fac-
tors, evidence from previous research, or their poten-
tial as confounders based on known associations with
cardiovascular
outcomes
and
observed
associations
with sauna exposure using the available data [31].
The cumulative survival from CVDs according to the
frequency and duration of sauna bathing was calcu-
lated using the Kaplan-Meier method. We explored
the shape of the relationship between the frequency
of sauna bathing and CVD mortality, using restricted
cubic spline with knots at the 5th, 35th, 65th, and
95th percentiles of the distribution of sauna frequency
in a multivariate-adjusted model. We also character-
ized the shape of the association between duration of
sauna bathing and CVD mortality risk by calculating
HRs within the quartiles of the duration of sauna
bathing and plotted them against mean sauna bathing
duration within each quartile using floating absolute
risks. We performed subgroup analyses using inter-
action tests to assess statistical evidence of any differ-
ences in HRs across levels/categories of pre-specified
clinically relevant characteristics such as age at sur-
vey,
gender,
BMI,
SBP,
total
cholesterol,
LDL-C,
high-density
lipoprotein
cholesterol
(HDL-C),
total
duration of physical activity per week, energy expend-
iture of physical activity, history of diabetes mellitus,
smoking status, history of hypertension, and prevalent
CHD. To minimize biases due to reverse causation,
sensitivity analysis involved excluding the first 5 years
of follow-up.
To assess whether adding information on the frequency
of sauna bathing (main exposure) to conventional cardio-
vascular risk factors would result in an improvement in
the prediction of CVD mortality risk, we calculated mea-
sures of discrimination for censored time-to-event data
(Harrell’s C-index [32]) and reclassification [33, 34]. To
investigate the change in C-index on the addition of
frequency of sauna bathing, two CVD mortality risk pre-
diction models were fitted: one model based on traditional
risk factors (i.e., age, sex, SBP, history of diabetes, total
cholesterol, HDL-C, and smoking) and the second model
with these risk factors plus frequency of sauna bathing.
Reclassification analysis was restricted to the first 10 years
of follow-up and was assessed using the net reclassifica-
tion improvement (NRI) [33] and integrated discrimin-
ation improvement (IDI) [33]. Reclassification analysis was
based on predicted 10-year CVD mortality risk categories
of low (< 1%), intermediate (1 to < 5%), and high (≥ 5%) risk
as previously reported [35]. Given that Harrell’s C-index
can be very insensitive in detecting differences in risk pre-
diction analyses [36, 37], to avoid discarding potential bio-
markers that can be used in risk prediction, it has been
recommended to also use sensitive risk discrimination
methods such as the − 2 log likelihood test [36, 37]. There-
fore, in addition to Harrel’s C-index, we tested for differ-
ences in the − 2 log likelihood of prediction models with
and without the inclusion of frequency of sauna bathing. A
P value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
Statistical analyses were performed using Stata version 12
(Stata Corp, College Station, TX).
Results
Baseline characteristics
A summary of the baseline characteristics of overall
study participants and according to the group of weekly
frequency of sauna bathing is shown in Table 1. There
were 867 (51.4%) female and 821 (48.6%) male partici-
pants. The mean (SD) age, BMI, and waist-to-hip ratio
were 63 years (7), 27.9 kg/m2 (4.4), and 0.91 (0.09),
respectively. The median (interquartile range, IQR) fre-
quency and duration of sauna bathing were two (one to
three) sessions and 30 min (15–45) per week, respect-
ively. The mean (SD) temperature of the sauna bath was
75.9°C (9.9). The average temperature of sauna room
was slightly lower (74.8 °C) among participants who had
four to seven sauna bathing sessions per week compared
to those with only 1 sauna bathing session per week
(77.4 °C). Participants with a frequency of sauna bathing
of four to seven sessions per week had higher BMI and
alcohol and energy intake, compared to those with 1
sauna session per week. When comparing men to
women in terms of median frequency and duration of
sauna bathing, the median (IQR) values were two (two
to three) vs. two (one to two) sessions per week and 30
(20–45) vs. 20 min (13–30) per week, respectively; the
mean (SD) temperature of the sauna bath was 77.1 (9.0)
vs. 74.7 °C (10.5) for men and women, respectively.

 total of 181 CVD deaths occurred. Cardiovascular mor-
tality rates per 1000 person-years across the three fre-
quency groups of sauna bathing (one, two to three, and
four to seven times per week) were 10.1 (95% CI 7.9 to
12.9), 7.6 (6.3 to 9.2), and 2.7 (1.3 to 5.4), respectively.
According to the frequency of sauna bathing, cumulative
hazard curves demonstrated the lowest risk of CVD mor-
tality among participants who had four to seven sauna ses-
sions per week compared to other groups (P < 0.001 for
the log-rank test; Fig. 2). A restricted cubic spline curve
shows the risk of CVD mortality decreased linearly with
increasing sauna sessions from one to seven (P value for
non-linearity = 0.932) (Fig. 3). In the analyses adjusted
only for age and sex, compared to participants who had
one sauna session per week, the HRs of CVD mortality
were 0.71 (95% CI 0.52 to 0.98) and 0.30 (0.14 to 0.64) for
participants with two to three and four to seven sauna ses-
sions per week, respectively (Table 2). Additional adjust-
ment for several established risk factors and potential
confounders minimally attenuated the HRs: 0.77 (95% CI
0.56 to 1.07) for two to three sauna bathing sessions per
week and 0.36 (0.17 to 0.77) for four to seven sauna bath-
ing sessions per week. The corresponding HRs (for two to
three and four to seven sauna bathing sessions per week)
remained consistent after adjustment for incident CHD as
a time-varying covariate: 0.75 (95% CI 0.52 to 1.08) and
0.23 (0.08 to 0.65), respectively (Table 2). The results
remained
similar
to
additional
adjustment
for
the
temperature of sauna bathing. In the analyses by gender,
there was no statistically significant evidence of associa-
tions in women, which could be attributed largely to the
low event rates in the sauna exposure categories (Table 2).
A test of interaction showed that the association between
sauna bathing frequency and CVD mortality was not sig-
nificantly modified by gender (P for interaction = 0.524).
Cardiovascular mortality rates per 1000 person-years
of follow-up across the three groups of sauna bathing
duration (≤ 15, 16–45, > 45 min/week) were 9.6 (95%

respectively. Cumulative hazard curves demonstrated
a greater risk of CVD mortality among participants
having a sauna bath of ≤ 15 min/week compared with
the other groups (P = 0.028 for the log-rank test;
Fig. 2). In the analysis adjusted for (i) age and sex
and (ii) BMI, smoking, SBP, serum LDL-C, alcohol
consumption, previous myocardial infarction, and type
2 diabetes, an inverse association was found between
duration of sauna bathing and CVD mortality risk,
which was potentially consistent with either a curvi-
linear or linear shape (Fig. 4). However, statistical
tests suggested a fit with a non-linear shape (P for
non-linearity = 0.005). After adjustment for age and
gender, HR was 0.49 (0.30–0.80) for CVD mortality
among participants in the highest weekly duration
(> 45 min/week) compared with the lowest weekly
duration (≤ 15 min/week) of sauna bathing (Table 3).

 consistent in the analyses that excluded the first 5 years
of follow-up (Additional file 2: Tables S1–S2). In a
subsidiary analysis which compared four to seven sauna
sessions per week with zero to one sauna session per
week, the associations were similar (Additional file 2:

Associations in subgroups
Figures 5 and 6 show the associations of frequency and
duration of sauna bathing with the risk of CVD death in
clinically relevant subgroups. Except for the evidence of
effect modification by diabetes status for the association
between sauna frequency and CVD mortality (P for
interaction = 0.021), the associations did not vary signifi-
cantly by levels or categories of several clinically relevant
characteristics.
Frequency of sauna bathing and CVD mortality risk
prediction
A risk prediction model for CVD mortality containing
conventional risk factors yielded a C-index of 0.7716
(95% CI 0.7382–0.8049; P < 0.001). After addition of in-
formation on the frequency of sauna bathing, the
C-index was 0.7807 (0.7486–0.8128; P < 0.001), repre-
senting a significant increase of 0.0091 (0.0022–0.0160;
P = 0.010). In addition, when investigating differences in
the -2 log likelihood of the risk score with and without
the inclusion of frequency of sauna bathing, the -2 log
likelihood was significantly improved on the addition of
information on the frequency of sauna bathing to the
model (P for comparison = 0.019). There was a signifi-
cant improvement in the classification of participants
into predicted 10-year CVD mortality risk categories
(NRI: 4.14%, 1.30–6.97%; P = 0.004). The IDI was 0.0037
(0.0002–0.0072; P = 0.041).

 Discussion
The findings of this long-term prospective study of over
14 years follow-up suggest that the cardiovascular bene-
fits of sauna bathing may exist in both men and women.
Our new results show that addition of information on
the frequency of sauna bathing improved the prediction
and reclassification of the long-term risk for CVD mor-
tality. A higher frequency of sauna bathing sessions per
week was related to a decreased risk of fatal CVD events
independent of conventional cardiovascular risk factors
as well as several other potential confounders. The risk
of fatal CVD events decreased with increasing sauna

 sessions in a dose-response manner with no threshold
effect. For the duration of sauna bathing per week, we
observed a decrease in risk of CVD mortality with
increasing duration of sauna bathing, though further
work may be required to ascertain whether a curvilinear
or linear shape best describes the relationship. The asso-
ciation was strong and also independent of several estab-
lished and emerging risk factors. Except for the evidence
of effect modification by diabetes status for the associ-
ation between sauna frequency and CVD mortality, the
associations were not modified significantly by levels or
categories of several clinically relevant characteristics in-
cluding gender. However, findings from the subgroup
analyses should be interpreted with caution given the
multiple statistical tests of interaction and the low event
rates in these subgroups.
Several mechanisms can be postulated to underpin the
protective effects of sauna bathing on cardiovascular mor-
tality. Dry and hot sauna baths have been shown to in-
crease the demands of cardiovascular function [5, 22, 38].
Sauna bathing causes an increase in heart rate which is a
reaction to the body heat load. Heart rate may be elevated
up to 120–150 beats per minute during sauna bathing,
corresponding to low- to moderate-intensity physical
exercise training for the circulatory system without active
muscle work [30, 39–41]. Acute sauna exposure has been
shown to produce blood pressure lowering effects [42],
decrease peripheral vascular resistance [42, 43] and arter-
ial stiffness [17, 44], and improve arterial compliance [18].
Short-term sauna exposure also activates the sympathetic
nervous and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone systems
and the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal hormonal axis,
and short-term increases in levels of their associated hor-
mones have been reported [45]. Repeated sauna exposure
improves endothelial function, suggesting a beneficial role
of thermal therapy on vascular function [16–18, 46].
Long-term sauna bathing habit may be beneficial in the
reduction of high systemic blood pressure [42], which is in
line with previous evidence showing that blood pressure
may be lower among those who are living in warm condi-
tions with higher ambient temperature [47, 48]. We have
demonstrated that regular sauna bathing is associated with

 a lowered risk of future hypertension [6]. Typical hot and
dry Finnish sauna increases body temperature which
causes more efficient skin blood flow, leading to a higher
cardiac output, whereas blood flow to internal organs de-
creases [22]. Sweat is typically secreted at a rate which
corresponds to an average total secretion of 0.5 kg during
a sauna bathing session [5, 39]. Increased sweating is
accompanied by a reduction in blood pressure and higher
heart rate, while cardiac stroke volume is largely main-
tained, although a part of blood volume is diverted from
the internal organs to body peripheral parts with decreas-
ing venous return which is not facilitated by active skeletal
muscle work [49]. However, it has been proposed that
muscle blood flow may increase to at least some extent in
response to heat stress, although sauna therapy-induced
myocardial metabolic adaptations are largely unexplored
[30, 50]. There is also evidence that regular long-term
sauna bathing (average of two sessions per week) increases
left ventricular ejection fraction [46]. Heat therapy may
improve left ventricular function with decreased cardiac
pre- and afterload, thereby maintaining appropriate stroke
volume despite large reductions in ventricular filling pres-
sures [16, 38, 51–53]. Additionally, previous studies have
demonstrated a positive alteration of the autonomic
nervous system and reduced levels of natriuretic peptides,
oxidative stress, inflammation, and norepinephrine due to
regular sauna therapy [15, 30, 43, 53, 54].
Our current results highlight a substantial risk reduc-
tion of fatal CVD events in men and women, with fre-
quent sauna use of over four times per week and
duration of sauna bathing of more than 45 min/week.
The data suggests that a history of more frequent sauna
use is associated with a decrease in the risk of fatal CVD
in a linear dose-response manner. Our data was based
on the total weekly duration of sauna sessions, and
therefore, we are unable to make any comments regard-
ing the minimum duration of a single session that may
confer benefits. However, based on historical data, a typ-
ical sauna session usually ranges from 5 to 20 min [30],
although longer sauna bathing sessions may be used

 depending on the individual [22]. The findings also show
that frequency of sauna bathing has incremental predict-
ive value to CVD mortality beyond conventional risk
factors and has the ability to reclassify subjects across
clinically relevant risk thresholds. There was no statisti-
cally significant evidence of effect modification by gen-
der. Regular Finnish sauna bathing is safe and may have
several additional health benefits. Patients with a previ-
ous myocardial infarction, stable angina pectoris, or
heart failure can usually enjoy sauna bathing without
any significant adverse cardiovascular effects [5, 22, 55].
In this long-term follow-up study, CVD mortality rate
among most active sauna users (i.e., those participants
with sauna of four to seven times per week) was 2.7
cases per 1000 person-years, indicating low risk. How-
ever, in a specific group of older individuals who are
prone to orthostatic hypotension, sauna baths should be
taken cautiously due to possible sudden drop in blood
pressures which may occur just after a hot and dry bath
[22, 30, 56]. Hypotension during and immediately after
sauna can be easily prevented by appropriate fluid intake
to avoid dehydration [16, 30]. Further investigation into
the value of regular sauna bathing in CVD risk reduction
and prevention in general populations is warranted.
Several strengths of the current study deserve consid-
eration. This is the first prospective evaluation of the
associations of both frequency and duration of sauna
bathing with the risk of cardiovascular mortality in a
general population including both genders. Our cohort
was well characterized with a long-term follow-up
period, and there were no losses to follow-up. This rep-
resentative sample of middle-aged to elderly men and
women who use saunas makes it possible to generalize
the observed results in Northern European populations;
however, prospective studies should be conducted in
populations who are not accustomed to regular sauna
bathing. We adjusted for a comprehensive panel of life-
style and biological markers and included subgroup as
well as risk prediction analyses using sensitive measures
such as the − 2 log likelihood. Our findings were robust
to the exclusion of the first 5 years of follow-up, minim-
izing the possibility of reverse causation bias as the
explanation for our findings. Several limitations of the
current study also merit consideration. As with all obser-
vational epidemiological studies, exposure assessments
based on self-administered questionnaires are prone to
misclassification and recall bias. Our findings from hot
Finnish sauna bathing with an average temperature of
approximately 80 °C cannot be directly applied to other
type of steam rooms and warm water therapy which
may operate at lower temperatures than a relatively dry
traditional sauna and do not allow humidity changes
achieved by pouring water on the heated rocks [30].
Good ventilation is a feature of a typical sauna which
makes it comfortable to stay for longer periods while
sauna bathing. The relatively low event rate for cardio-
vascular deaths (N = 181) precluded detailed assessment
of (i) effect modification by relevant clinical characteris-
tics on the associations and (ii) dose-response relation-
ships of the associations. Though we accounted for
many potential confounders to ensure the validity of our
associations, there is a potential for residual confound-
ing. It is possible that underlying diagnosed or undiag-
nosed diseases may have an effect on sauna bathing
habits, suggesting reverse causality; however, our sub-
group analyses according to various clinical characteris-
tics were consistent and the associations remained
robust in several sensitivity analyses, independent of
many underlying clinical conditions and exclusion of the
first 5 years of follow-up. Sauna bathing habits may have
changed during follow-up due to probable changes in
health habits or other incident diseases of participants
occurring over the long period of time; however, any
changes may be minimal as sauna habits are fairly stable
in the Finnish population [30]. We could not account
for the longer-term duration and regularity of sauna use
prior to the study entry because of the lack of data.
However, it is a common way to assess usual lifestyle ac-
tivities using baseline questionnaires in long-term epi-
demiological studies. Secondly, we were unable to assess
the associations between sauna bathing and CVD mor-
tality risk when comparing people who used sauna with
people who did not use sauna at all (control group). In-
deed, the majority of Finnish people are accustomed to
having a sauna bath regularly at least once per week, as
it is traditionally part of the Finnish culture [30, 40]. The
associations were unchanged in a subsidiary analysis
which employed a combination of people who did not
use sauna baths and those who had a single sauna ses-
sion per week as a reference comparison.
In Finland, sauna is easily accessible to the majority of
the population independently of socioeconomic and edu-
cational backgrounds. Sauna bathing is an activity that has
been a tradition in Finland for thousands of years, and our
data shows minor differences in annual salary levels ac-
cording to the sauna frequency groups (in years 1998–
2001; see Table 1), suggesting that sauna ownership does
not correlate with financial status in Finland. It is there-
fore highly unlikely that these factors may explain the ob-
served findings on sauna and fatal CVD events in this
population. Indeed, SES did not differ when comparing
one vs. four to seven times per week frequency groups;
SES level was the highest among those using sauna two to
three times per week. Based on our cross-sectional base-
line data, the most frequent sauna use was directly related
to the level of physical activity, BMI, energy intake, and al-
cohol consumption. Though there is a possibility that fac-
tors such as physical activity could potentially explain
Laukkanen et al. BMC Medicine          (2018) 16:219 
Page 11 of 14
 these finding, it is unlikely as our analysis accounted for
the role of physical activity. Furthermore, our recent re-
search evidence suggests that a combination of regular
physical fitness and sauna baths is associated with a sub-
stantial reduction in the risk of fatal cardiovascular and
all-cause mortality events compared with each modality
alone [57, 58]. We have shown that even participants with
low fitness levels have a reduced risk of mortality when
combined with frequent (3–7 sessions per week) or infre-
quent (≤ 2 sessions per week) sauna use. However, mortal-
ity risk is substantially reduced in those with very high
fitness levels combined with frequent use of sauna. Other
studies have also reported similar findings. Iwase and col-
leagues demonstrated enhance metabolism in participants
when isotonic exercise was performed during sauna ex-
posure [59]. On the effects of sauna bathing on athletes,
Ridge and Pyke demonstrated an augmentation in acute
physiological responses when sauna exposure followed ex-
ercise [60]. In another study in which six male distance
runners completed 3 weeks of post-training sauna bath-
ing, study participants experienced an enhancement in en-
durance running performance [61]. The overall findings
show that physical activity or fitness and sauna bathing
each have independent effects on vascular disease [57, 58],
which suggests that the beneficial effects of sauna bathing
on CVD mortality is not due to physical activity or
exercise.
Conclusions
The current prospective study provides novel evidence
that higher frequency and duration of sauna bathing
may be related to a lower risk of CVD mortality in a
representative population-based sample of female and
male participants. In addition, the frequency of sauna
bathing significantly improves the prediction and clas-
sification of the 10-year risk for CVD mortality be-

risk
factors.
Our
results extend previous evidence that sauna bathing
may have cardiovascular benefits; however, further
studies are still needed to confirm our findings in dif-
ferent populations and also assess the associations of
sauna bathing habits with cause-specific cardiovascu-
lar events.
