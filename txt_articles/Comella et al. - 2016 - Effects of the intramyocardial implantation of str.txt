Abstract 
Background: Stromal vascular fraction (SVF) can easily be obtained from a mini-lipoaspirate procedure of fat tissue. 
The SVF contains a mixture of cells including ADSCs and growth factors and has been depleted of the adipocyte 
(fat cell) population. We evaluated the safety and efficacy of administering SVF intra-myocardially into patients with 
chronic ischemic cardiomyopathy.
Methods: A total of 28 patients underwent a local tumescent liposuction procedure to remove approximately 60 ml 
of fat tissue. The fat was separated to isolate the SVF and the cells were delivered into the akinetic myocardial scar 
region using a transendocardial delivery system (MyoCath®) in patients who had experienced a previous myocardial 
infarct. The subjects were then monitored for adverse events, ejection fraction via echocardiogram and six-minute 
walk test (6MWT) over a period of 6 months.
Results: The average EF was 29 % at baseline and significantly increased to 35 % at both 3 and 6 months. Patients 
walked an average of 349 m at baseline and demonstrated a statistically significant improvement at 3 and 6 months’ 
post treatment of more than 80 m.
Conclusions: Overall, patients were pleased with the treatment results. More importantly, the procedure demon-
strated a strong safety profile with no severe adverse events or complications linked to the therapy.

Background
Heart disease is the number one cause of death in the 
world and the leading cause of death in the United States. 
Heart disease accounts for one in seven deaths in the 
U.S., killing over 370,000 Americans per year [1]. The 
prognosis of patients with heart failure is poor with a 
5-year mortality that approaches 50 % [2]. Patients with 
chronic ischemic cardiomyopathy (IC) have a signifi-
cantly decreased left ventricular function with ejection 
fraction of less than 35–40 %. In cases of myocardial 
infarction, there is an irreversible loss of tissue that

cannot be recovered by coronary revascularization due to 
the fact that the infarcted tissue is not viable [3].
The disease process if IC results includes coronary 
artery occlusion, which provokes ischemia downstream 
causing cardiomyocytic apoptosis within minutes. This 
injury and cell death floods the region with reactive oxy-
gen species and toxic agents that cause the cells around 
the injury to respond by upregulating and secreting 
cytokines and chemokines such as tumor necrosis factor 
alpha (TNF) and a variety of interleukins. The recruit-
ment of pro-inflammatory cells home to the damaged 
area and attract immune cells. These cells then gradually 
clear cellular debris and matrix degradation products at 
the injury site, leaving behind sparse tissue. This gap of 
tissue later fills with granulation tissue which is mainly 
composed of blood vessels, macrophages and myofibro-
blasts. After 1 week, the infarcted area starts to develop 
into a dense scar with collagen deposits intermingled 
with myofibroblasts. The ischemic area is rich in inflam-
matory cytokines and protease activity which harms 
surrounding healthy cells, further compromising the 
integrity of the cardiac tissue by causing ventricular dys-
function and electrical instability [4].
Adult mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have emerged as 
a candidate cell type with great potential in regenerative 
medicine [5, 6]. MSCs are being investigated as a regen-
erative biologic agent because of their ability to differen-
tiate into multiple tissue types and to self-renew.
The paracrine activity of MSCs is thought to be one 
of the major means by which these cells mediate anti-
inflammatory, anti-apoptotic, anti-fibrotic, angiogenic, 
mitogenic and wound healing properties. The complex 
interplay of the biological mediators secreted by MSCs 
has been shown to be important in regulating regen-
eration of damaged or diseased organs and tissues of the 
body. It has also been shown that the pre-curser to the 
MSC is the pericyte which are the cells present on the 
microvessels and capillaries throughout the body. These 
cells become “activated” when an injury is recognized and 
detach to become medicinal MSCs. An immune-modula-
tory effect is initiated where other cells are called to help 
with the healing process while other secreted molecules 
will establish a regenerative microenvironment by setting 
up a trophic field [7].
Stem cells derived from a patient’s own fat are referred 
to as adipose-derived stem cells [8]. Adipose-derived 
stem cells or ADSCs are multi-potential in that they 
have the ability to differentiate into a variety of different 
types of tissue including but not limited to bone, carti-
lage, muscle, and fat. These cells have also been shown to 
express a variety of different growth factors and signaling 
molecules (cytokines), which recruit other stem cells to 
facilitate repair and healing of the affected tissue. ADSCs 
are very angiogenic in nature and can promote the 
growth of new blood vessels. In addition, ADSCs might 
play a role in the local inflammatory process [9, 10].
A stromal vascular fraction (SVF) can easily be isolated 
from fat tissue in approximately 30–90 min in a clinic 
setting using a mini-lipoaspirate technique. The SVF 
contains a mixture of cells including ADSCs and growth 
factors and has been depleted of the adipocyte (fat cell) 
population. It has been shown that cells isolated from 
the SVF contain an abundance of CD34+ cells [11]. This 
marker is present on both pericytes and mesenchymal 
cells. Cells expressing CD34 are also known to reside in 
a periendothelial location and stabilize endothelial net-
works. SVF can be used in a point of care setting for a 
variety of indications and is currently being used in thou-
sands of clinics world-wide with varying degrees of suc-
cess reported. Adipose tissue is quickly becoming the 
preferred source for point of care treatments in clinic due 
to the high number of MSCs that can be obtained and the 
low number of leukocytes as compared to bone marrow 
[12]. In addition, adipose tissue has a significantly higher 
amount of pericytes which are the precursors to MSCs 
[13, 14].
Stem cells from adipose tissue offer a novel therapy 
for patients with IC [15, 16]. SVF injected into areas of 
low perfusion or scars in the cardiac tissue may become 
populated with angiogenic stem cells, improving blood 
supply in the area and reducing myocardial scar size 
[17–19]. SVF is an attractive therapeutic method given 
that the harvesting process is safe and the cells are read-
ily available in usually large quantities. Transplanta-
tion of SVF or ADSCs in animal models of myocardial 
infarction [20, 21] and dilated cardiomyopathy [22] 
significantly improves left ventricular cardiac func-
tion and decreases mortality after cell transplantation 
[15, 23–26]. The benefits of ADSCs are postulated to 
come from their influence on neovascularization of the 
ischemic tissue and their protection of resident cells [27, 
28]. The delivery of angiogenic proteins like angiopoi-
etin1 (Ang1), survival factors like insulin growth factor 
1 (IGF-1), and chemokines like stromal cell-derived fac-
tor-1 (SDF-1), further enhance the recovery of injured 
myocardium [29].
Perin et al. reported the results from 21 patients who 
were injected with SVF via catheter directly into the 
myocardium. All procedures were well tolerated, safe and 
feasible. In addition, patients injected with SVF may have 
preserved ventricular function, myocardial perfusion and 
exercise capacity [30]. We report the safety and prelimi-
nary efficacy results of catheter-based SVF administra-
tion in patients with chronic ischemia.

Methods
Study design
The open label study was conducted at 2 centers on 28 
patients. The protocol was approved by the institutional 
review board of each institution and all patients pro-
vided written informed consent. The trial was funded in 
part by US Stem Cell Inc., (FKA Bioheart Inc.—Sunrise, 
FL). SVF was injected intra-myocardially into akinetic 
tissue under fluoroscopic guidance. Clinical evaluations 
were scheduled at baseline, 1, 3 and 6 months. The pri-
mary safety endpoint was serious adverse events (SAEs) 
and were defined as any event that was fatal or life-threat-
ening, led to hospitalizations, or required major medi-
cal intervention. The primary efficacy endpoint was the 
change in six-minute walk test (6MWT) distance at 3 and 
6 months. The secondary efficacy endpoint was the effect 
on global left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) at 3 and 
6 months.
Patient eligibility
Patients age 18–90 years with a New York Heart Associa-
tion (NYHA) class II to IV heart failure and LVEF <40 % 
were eligible for the study. Patients were excluded if they 
had recent coronary artery bypass graft surgery or cardiac 
resynchronization therapy (<90 days). Patients with planned 
revascularization were also excluded. Patients with active 
cancer or infections including human immunodeficiency 
virus, hepatitis B or C, or cytomegalovirus were excluded.
Cell preparation and study intervention
From each patient, approximately 60 ml fat was collected 
using a 3 mm aspiration cannula with prior administra-
tion of tumescent solution. The tissue was prepared 
using an adipose stromal vascular fraction preparation 
kit (US Stem Cell, Inc. Sunrise, FL). The adipose tissue 
was washed with buffered saline and digested using col-
lagenase (Cellase, US Stem Cell, Inc., Sunrise, FL) at 37 °C 
for 12–30 min with agitation at 5-min intervals. The sus-
pension was centrifuged at 500×g for 5 min to collect 
the SVF as a pellet. The pellet was washed twice and fil-
tered through a 100 μm cell strainer with buffered saline 
to remove any residual enzyme. The final SVF pellet was 
resuspended in approximately 4.5ccs of normal saline. 
Samples were taken to determine the cell quantity and 
viability.
The SVF was intra-myocardially injected into the tar-
geted treatment region using the MyoCath® (US Stem 
Cell, Inc. Sunrise, FL) catheter delivery system under 
fluoroscopic guidance as previously described [31]. Six-
teen injections of 0.25ccs each were delivered into the 
myocardium for a total volume of 4ccs.
Outcomes
The primary safety outcome was the incidence of SAEs 
over 6 months. This included death, myocardial infarc-
tion, rehospitalization, and arrhythmia. The efficacy 
outcomes were changes in 6MWT and LVEF by echocar-
diogram from baseline to 3 and 6 months. Wall thickness 
was measured in a small subset of patients. This study was 
designed to primarily assess the safety and feasibility of 
the percutaneous AdipoCell™ transplantation procedure 
and secondarily to provide preliminary data regarding the 
efficacy of intramyocardial SVF transplantation. Formal 
power calculations were not performed. Two tailed statis-
tical analyses were performed and confidence intervals are 
presented with 95 % degree of confidence. All statistical 
tests used a significance level of α ≤0.05. Several patients 
did not complete some or all of the follow up tests. For 
those patients, the baseline data was not included in the 
statistical analysis or the graphs presented.
Results
Patient baseline evaluation
A total of 28 patients were enrolled in the study and 
treated at one of two clinical sites. Baseline clinical char-
acteristics and demographics of the patients are listed 
in Table 1. Ninety-three percent of the patients were 
male and 7 % female with an average age of 65.8 (range 
29–87). A majority (54 %) of the patients presented as 
NYHA class III with an average of 28 % LVEF. Twenty-
four and eleven patients completed LVEF by echocar-
diogram at 3 and 6 months, respectively. A small group 
of four patients completed LVEF at 12 months. Twelve 
and eight patients completed 6MWT at 3 and 6 months,

respectively. Three patients completed 6MWT at 
12 months. In addition, three patients completed wall 
thickness measurements at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months.
Adipose and SVF collection
All procedures were well tolerated and uneventful, result-
ing in a collection of approximately 60ccs of adipose tis-
sue. Approximately 30–60 million SVF cells were obtained. 
According to validation studies, the population obtained is 
at least 50 % positive for CD34 with a viability of greater 
than 90 % (data not shown). In addition to testing the pro-
liferation capacity of the cells, differentiation assays for 
adipogenesis (fat), osteogenesis (Bone) and chondrogene-
sis (cartilage) were completed. The samples shown in Fig. 1 
displayed positive differentiation results confirming the 
presence of multi-potential mesenchymal stem cells.
Transplantation procedure
The transplantation procedure was successful in 28/28 
patients. Patients received approximately 30–60 million 
cells in 4ccs volume. A total of 16 injections (0.25 mL each) 
were placed via catheter into the myocardium at half the 
measured thickness as determined by echocardiography.
Efficacy outcomes
The efficacy outcome of the LVEF by echocardiogram 
demonstrated 
statistically 
significant 
improvement 
at both 3 and 6 months (Fig. 2). Absolute LVEF went 
from 29 % at baseline to 35 % at both 3 and 6 months 
(p < 0.01). Four patients completed 12 month follow up 
and went from 25 % at baseline to 31 % (p < 0.05). The 
change in LVEF from baseline was 5.6, 6.3 and 6.0 % at 3, 
6 and 12 months, respectively.
Patients 
demonstrated 
a 
statistically 
significant 
improvement in 6MWT (Fig. 3). Twelve patients 
went from an average of 349 m at baseline to 430 m at 
3 months (p < 0.01). Eight patients went from an average 
of 295–380 m at 6 months (p < 0.01) and three patients 
went from 287 to 433 m at 12 months (p < 0.03). This cor-
responded to an average change of 81, 85 and 147 m at 3, 
6 and 12 months respectively.
Wall thickness collected on three patients showed 
numerical improvement at 1 month and statistical signif-
icance at 3, 6 and 12 months (Fig. 4). Patients went from 
a wall thickness of 7.5 at baseline to 8.4 (p < 0.06), 9.2 
(p < 0.05), 9.7 (p < 0.05) and 9.7 (p < 0.05) at 1, 3, 6 and 
12 months respectively. This corresponded to an average 
change of 0.93, 1.73, 2.17 and 2.17.
Safety analysis
Three patient deaths were reported during a 12 month 
follow up period. The first patient experienced a bowel 
obstruction 7 months’ post stem cell procedure. The 
patient was administered contrast solution to determine 
the extent of obstruction and went into cardiac arrest. 
He survived the episode but continued to deteriorate 
until death. Another patient died 12 months’ post pro-
cedure, however, cause of death was not recorded. The 
patient withdrew from the study at 3 months and did 
not obtain any follow up tests. The third patient passed 
4 weeks post stem cell procedure due to pulmonary

thromboembolism. All SAEs were reviewed and adjudi-
cated by the local hospital IRB.
Other reported adverse events included soreness in 
the abdomen after the mini-liposuction procedure. One 
patient reported headache and nausea for 48 h post pro-
cedure. Patients were instructed to take Tylenol for pain 
and all events resolved within 7–10 days. One patient 
experienced a small hematoma at the aspiration site 
which resolved within 7 days after application of ice. 
Many patients experienced brief bradycardia or arrhyth-
mia at time of injection which lasted from 30 s to several 
minutes. All occurrences resolved without intervention.
Discussion
Chronic heart ischemia is a progressive degenerative 
disease associated with high rates of death and limited 
clinical options. In recent years, stem cell therapy has 
developed with promising preclinical results and prelimi-
nary clinical results. Adipose derived stem cells as part of 
the stromal vascular fraction are a feasible candidate for 
cardiac indications. The SVF does not require in vitro cul-
ture expansion and is easy to collect bedside. These cells 
can be placed directly into the damaged areas of the myo-
cardium utilizing a minimally invasive catheter technique.
This clinical study demonstrated the safety and feasi-
bility of utilizing the SVF in heart disease patients. No 
major safety issues were noted and the procedures were

well tolerated in all patients. In addition, the rates of 
death were below those reported for no-option angina 
patients [32]. We reported three deaths for a total mor-
tality of 10.7 %.
The safety profile is consistent with previously reported 
results by Perin et al. in the PRECISE trial. This trial 
showed significant improvements in MVO2, total left 
ventricular mass by MRI, and wall motion score index. 
In the same trial, LVEF outcomes failed to show signifi-
cant differences between control and treated patients. 
This study did not report outcomes on 6MWT or wall 
thickness. In our study, patients demonstrated a statisti-
cally significant improvement in LVEF, 6MWT and wall 
thickness. Absolute LVEF improved by approximately 
6 % at 3, 6 and 12 months post procedure. In addition, 
patients are walking an additional 80+ m after the stem 
cell treatment. We believe that exercise capacity or 
6MWT may be a better indication of the overall well-
being of the patients. Subjective quality of life parameters 
were reported but these would need to be substantiated 
in double blind placebo controlled studies.
Although this study suggests that the use of SVF is safe 
and feasible, the general under powering of the study 
coupled with the lack of placebo control would render 
additional studies necessary to determine the true clini-
cal effect of the treatment. In addition, several patients 
were lost to follow up which could compound the data 
and create patient bias. Given the encouraging results on 
this small sample size with statistical significance, large 
appropriately powered clinical studies blinded to both 
clinical staff and patients are warranted.
Conclusions
The current study sought to define the safety and feasibil-
ity of percutaneous intramyocardial transplantation of 
autologous SVF in patients with chronic ischemia cardio-
myopathy. Several parameters demonstrated statistically 
significant improvements over a 6–12 months time period. 
A true evaluation of efficacy and safety would require 
larger phase II/III studies. However, the current study does 
provide encouraging feasibility data regarding the endo-
myocardial stem cell treatment and suggests some clinical 
benefit of the SVF therapy in heart failure patients.
