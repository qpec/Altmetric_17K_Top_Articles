Biomarkers are rapidly gaining importance in personalized medicine. Although numerous
molecular signatures have been developed over the past decade, there is a lack of overlap and
many biomarkers fail to validate in independent patient cohorts and hence are not useful for
clinical application. For these reasons, identification of novel and robust biomarkers remains a
formidable challenge. We combine targeted proteomics with computational biology to
discover robust proteomic signatures for prostate cancer. Quantitative proteomics conducted
in expressed prostatic secretions from men with extraprostatic and organ-confined prostate
cancers identified 133 differentially expressed proteins. Using synthetic peptides, we evaluate
them by targeted proteomics in a 74-patient cohort of expressed prostatic secretions in urine.
We quantify a panel of 34 candidates in an independent 207-patient cohort. We apply
machine-learning approaches to develop clinical predictive models for prostate cancer
diagnosis and prognosis. Our results demonstrate that computationally guided proteomics
can discover highly accurate non-invasive biomarkers.

 T
he worldwide incidence of prostate cancer has been
steadily increasing, but many patients harbour tumours
of an indolent nature. These indolent tumours grow slowly
and pose minimal threat to the life of the patient, in the absence
of treatment (that is, are clinically insignificant). However, once
prostate cancer begins to grow aggressively, it metastasizes
quickly with lethal consequences. The management of prostate
cancer has become an urgent clinical dilemma with significant
over-diagnosis and challenges in predicting patient survival1.
Prostate cancers are uniquely heterogeneous with major spatial2,3
and temporal4 variability in their genomes. Therefore, once
cancer has been confirmed, the optimal course of action is
tailored to spare patients with indolent disease from unnecessary
procedures, while identifying and treating those who would
benefit
from
treatment
intensification.
Current
clinical
stratification employs the Gleason score (GS), estimates of
tumour size and pretreatment prostate-specific antigen (PSA)
levels. However, generating the GS requires obtaining biopsy
specimens, a procedure that increases the risk of hospitalizations
from post-biopsy complications, posing a significant burden on
healthcare and risking serious complications5,6. In addition,
biopsies under-sample the prostate, and significant lesions
are
frequently
missed7.
Localized
prostate
cancer
has
excellent
prognosis,
with
almost
100%
5-year
survival
(http://seer.cancer.gov/statistics/summaries.html), but B70% of
these men receive early intervention in the form of surgery or
radiotherapy8–12. These therapies carry significant morbidities
and healthcare costs, and surveillance protocols rely on repeat
PSA testing, digital rectal examination (DRE) and multiple
biopsies13,14. A major gap that currently exists in prostate cancer
diagnostics is that no accurate biomarkers are available that could
overcome these potential complications (that is, invasive and
heterogeneity). A fluid-based biomarker would be ideal.
Liquid biopsies, such as circulating tumour cells15 and cell-free
DNA16, have been proposed as promising non-invasive prostate
cancer biomarkers, but their detection and enrichment remain
technically challenging. Cataloguing the secreted and soluble
factors released into the interstitial fluid that bathes the organ of
interest may provide a novel inventory of putative disease
biomarkers. We have interrogated the collection of proteins
comprising
a
prostate-proximal
fluid,
expressed
prostatic
secretions (EPSs)17–20, that is collected either directly from the
prostate before radical prostatectomy (termed: direct EPS) or
from post-DRE urine (termed: post-DRE urine or EPS urine).
Reproducible detection and quantification of multiple proteins in
complex biological matrices is an essential requirement for any
potential disease biomarker, but verification of these candidates is
a major bottleneck in the pipeline from discovery to clinical
implementation.
Traditionally,
immunoaffinity-based
assays,
namely, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays are used to
validate
protein
biomarkers,
but
this
approach
is
time-
consuming, costly and relies on the existence of validated
antibody
pairs
for
every
target
protein.
Targeted
mass
spectrometry (MS) offers an alternative approach for the rapid
verification
of
candidate
biomarkers.
Selected
reaction
monitoring mass spectrometry (SRM-MS) is currently the
leading method for targeted quantification of proteins via MS.
It offers excellent selectivity, sensitivity and throughput, without
the need for validated antibodies.
Here we build on our proteomics studies of EPS and
systematically develop SRM-MS assays in post-DRE urine
samples. Step-wise applications of these assays to two indepen-
dent, richly annotated patient cohorts in conjunction with
computational modelling identify liquid-biopsy signatures that
accurately distinguish patients with organ-confined (OC) stage
pT2 and extracapsular stage pT3 prostate cancers, before radical
prostatectomy. These data highlight the value of readily accessible
tissue proximal fluids and multiplexed quantitative proteomic
signatures to identify extracapsular disease before invasive
surgery, potentially modifying the treatment options for these
patients.
Results
Candidate selection and assay evaluation. Our previously
generated
discovery
proteomic
profiles
from
direct
EPS
derived from extracapsular (EC) or OC prostate cancers laid the
foundation for the current project18. Relative quantification
revealed
133
proteins
that
were
significantly
differentially
expressed between both patient groups. These proteins were
identified by 1,346 distinct peptide sequences. Data mining of all
peptides based on sequence and biophysical properties led to 232
proteotypic peptides (phase 1 peptides) suitable for evaluation by
SRM-MS in EPS urine samples (Fig. 1a). To abrogate potential
confounding influences due to the differing modes of data
acquisition (discovery proteomics versus targeted proteomics),
instruments (ion trap versus triple quadrupole) and sample types
(direct EPS versus EPS urine), all phase 1 peptides were first
evaluated for reproducible detection by SRM-MS in EPS urine
samples. Each phase 1 peptide was purchased as a crude heavy-
isotope-labelled synthetic peptide and spiked into pooled EPS
urine samples to evaluate their suitability for targeted proteomics
assays, directly within the biomarker matrix. Light (endogenous)
and heavy (synthetic) peptides were monitored in SRM mode,
and data were manually inspected to select peptides that had at
least three fragment ions aligned at the expected peptide elution
time, had co-eluting light and heavy peptides, had minimal
interference and were reproducible. In total, 147 peptides (63%)
met these quality criteria (phase 2 peptides), and were taken
forward to an independent cohort of EPS urine samples (Fig. 1a).
These
results
demonstrate
that
systematic
SRM-MS
assay
development based on previous discovery proteomics data is
rapid and feasible in clinically useful EPS urine samples.
Peptide quantification in EPS urine cohort A. To evaluate phase
2 peptides, we performed relative quantification in a medium-
sized cohort of EPS urine samples (n ¼ 74; cohort A; Table 1),
using the crude heavy-isotope-labelled synthetic peptides as
internal standards (Methods). The goal of this initial quantifica-
tion was to evaluate peptide performance in relevant clinical
samples, while reducing the number of peptides to be moved
forward to the next development steps. Briefly, a Student’s t-test
was performed to compare the ratios of peptide abundance
between cancer and non-cancer groups (termed: diagnostic), as
well as EC and OC prostate cancers (termed: prognostic). The
first criteria used to select candidates as potential diagnostic and
prognostic biomarkers were P value cutoff points of 0.05 and 0.1,
respectively. A higher P value cutoff was used to select prognostic
candidates to avoid removing putative candidates at this early
stage for distinguishing cancer comparisons (EC versus OC
cancer groups). Refinements to the candidate list were made by
adding peptides representing the proteins IGJ and ANXA1,
because these peptides were the only candidates even trend
upregulated in the EC tumour group (Pr0.25). Furthermore, two
KLK3 peptides were added to monitor PSA levels. Finally, each
peptide that met the above criteria was manually inspected for
SRM-MS trace quality. Overall, 34 candidates (phase 3 peptides)
demonstrated
a
potential
for
classifying
individuals
based
on the prostatic disease status (Fig. 1b). Overall, 24 diagnostic
candidates (21 overexpressed in cancers) and 14 prognostic ones
(2 overexpressed in invasive tumours) were identified (Fig. 1c,d).
Our data suggest that SRM-MS assays developed in EPS urine

 samples are capable of separating patients into defined categories
using retrospective cohorts, while quickly triaging candidates
affected by large patient variability.
Absolute quantification in EPS urine cohort B. To generate
optimized SRM-MS assays for absolute quantification, highly
purified (497% purity) heavy stable isotope-labelled standards
(AQUA peptides) were purchased for all 34 phase 3 peptides.
Before quantification in independent samples (n ¼ 207; cohort B,
Table 1), a multiplexed, scheduled SRM-MS method was devel-
oped, enabling quantification of all candidate peptides in a single
chromatographic gradient (Fig. 2a; Methods). Next, all phase 3
peptides were quantified, using single-point quantification based
on 100 fmol addition of each AQUA peptide to standardized
amounts of total EPS urine (1 mg total protein on column), in an
independent cohort of 207 EPS urine samples (Table 1; Methods).
Each EPS urine was measured in two technical replicates. The
duplicate analyses demonstrated strong reproducibility with a
Pearson’s correlation coefficient (R) of 0.97 (Po2.2 � 10 � 16;
Fig. 2b). Of the 34 peptides, the majority (30 peptides, 88.24%)
showed strong correlations between two replicates (R40.7;
Supplementary Fig. 1). Furthermore, we examined the reprodu-
cibility depending on sample types (normal, benign prostatic
hyperplasia (BPH), pT2 and pT3 samples) and found that 31
peptides (91.18%) show strong reproducibility (R40.7) in at least
one type of sample (Supplementary Fig. 2). Peptides with Rr0.7
were generally of lower abundance (mean difference of peptide
abundance (log2 L:H ratio) between the groups is 4.96, P ¼ 0.01,

 Student’s t-test; Supplementary Fig. 3). The analysis also
demonstrated good chromatographic reproducibility (coefficient
of variationo1.5%) with most peptides eluting between 20 and
30 min
over
the
40-min
chromatographic
gradient
(Supplementary Fig. 4a,b).
To compare the correlation of our quantitative results in both
EPS urine cohorts, fold-change correlation plots were generated
for the various group comparisons. While different EPS urine
cohorts, spike-in standards and SRM-MS methods were used, we
were able to observe a generally positive correlation. On average,
73% of our peptides showed concordant expression in both
cohorts (Fig. 2c; Supplementary Fig. 5).
Next, the absolute concentration of each peptide across all 207
samples in cohort B was determined. The 34 peptides quantified
spanned approximately five orders of magnitude, from the low
fmol to nmol range per mg total EPS urine protein (Fig. 2d; ref.
21). As expected, the two most abundant peptides represented
KLK3, and in fact the KLK3 peptide HSQPWQVLVASR
demonstrated such a strong detector response that it was
ultimately removed from further analyses, as it would require
sample dilution to achieve accurate quantification via AQUA
spike-in. The remaining peptides spanned approximately three
orders of magnitude and significant inter-patient variation in
peptide expression was observed (Fig. 3a). These data demon-
strate
that
selected
biomarker
candidates
can
be
rapidly
quantified in large numbers of EPS urine samples spanning
approximately five orders of concentration.
Univariate analyses to distinguish patient groups. We investi-
gated the abundance of peptides in different patient risk groups
(normal, BPH, pT2 and pT3). All risk groups had similar age
distributions (average age of 60 years) and ethnic compositions
(White American ¼ 62%, Black American ¼ 38% and Asian
American ¼ 0.5%; Fig. 3a; Supplementary Fig. 6a,b). As we
expected, normal controls had the lowest concentration of serum
PSA (SPSA, average 5.06 ng ml � 1) and pT3 stage had the highest
concentration of SPSA (average 7.60 ng ml � 1, P ¼ 0.03, Student’s
t-test; Supplementary Fig. 6c). Next, we evaluated the ability of
individual peptides to distinguish among distinct patient groups
based on the absolute quantification of individual peptides. Most
(27/33) are more abundant in cancer patients (middle panel in
Fig. 3a) compared with normal controls (1.03–4.82 times more
expressed; Fig. 3b). Among them, 10 peptides had, on average,
2.2-fold change in expression (1.4–3.8-fold changes) with Po0.1
(Student’s t-test, red dots in Fig. 3b). Further, of all quantified
peptides,
28
(84.85%)
were
underexpressed
in
pT3
stage
(right panel in Fig. 3a) compared with pT2 stage (1.03–2.37 times
underexpressed;
Fig. 3d).
Nine peptides were significantly
downregulated in pT3 stage (0.5–0.8-fold changes with Po0.1,
Student’s t-test; red dots in Fig. 3d).
To evaluate the power of each peptide to distinguish individual
patient risk groups, we measured the area under the receiver
operating characteristic curve (AUC) of each peptide. For
diagnosis
(cancer
versus
normal),
one
peptide
(VEI-
TYTPSDGTQK) showed higher AUC (AUC ¼ 0.69) than SPSA

 (AUC ¼ 0.67), the currently used biomarker (Fig. 3c). For
prognosis (pT3 versus pT2), SPSA showed the highest prediction
ability (AUC ¼ 0.66, Fig. 3e). Neither SPSA nor any of our
individually selected peptides were able to accurately predict
patient risk groups with high confidence (AUC40.7). These
findings are in line with the general belief that signatures, rather
than individual biomarkers, are required to accurately distinguish
patient groups.
Signatures that distinguish patient groups. To identify subsets
of peptides that can serve as liquid-biopsy signatures and inte-
grate them into unified predictors that accurately discriminate
among our distinct patient risk groups, we employed a machine-
learning analysis (Fig. 4a). Briefly, we evaluated quantified
peptides as input features for machine learning and identified the
most relevant ones using Generalized Linear Models (GLMs)22.
The selection of reliable features reduces the dimensionality of the
feature space and leads to better performance in machine
learning23.
To
select
relevant
peptides,
we
measured
the
importance of each peptide to discriminate two classes of
patient risk groups (cancer versus normal controls or pT2
versus pT3 prostate cancers) and subsequently systematically
selected the top-ranked peptides as features to build predictive
models. To obtain stable predictions, predictive models were
tested by 100-fold bootstrapping (Methods). We evaluated the
prediction performance of selected peptides using AUC. A set of
peptides that showed the highest AUC was selected as the most
relevant features. Using these peptides as features, the best
predictive model was generated.
We found that the six top-ranked features, mapping to five
distinct gene products (IDHC, SERA, IGJ, EF2 and KCRB; pink

 bars in Fig. 4b) showed the best performance to discriminate all
prostate cancer patients (pT2 and pT3) from biopsy-verified
normal controls. From the 10-fold cross-validation, these features
predicted 70% of cases correctly (82% sensitivity and 47%
specificity). We found that a combination of these peptides
outperforms the traditional Food and Drug Administration-
approved biomarker, PSA. The predictive model showed an AUC
of 0.77 (95% confidence interval, 0.68–0.87, pink line in Fig. 4c).
In the test set (10% of entire data set), our predictive model
showed an AUC of 0.79 (95% of confidence interval, 0.76–0.81),
82% sensitivity and 49% specificity (Supplementary Fig. 7a). This
compares favourably with the performance of SPSA alone in
which the AUC is 0.67 (blue line in Fig. 4c), similar to previous
reports24. Furthermore, we compared our six-peptide biomarkers
to the null distribution in this data set by performing a large-scale
re-sampling study1,25. We generated 100 random sets of six
peptides, trained them using the same GLM approach used above
and measured the performance using AUC. A random model
achieved an AUC of 0.64 from the 10-fold cross-validation (grey
line in Fig. 4c) and 0.61 from test set (Supplementary Fig. 7a).
Indeed, our selected peptide biomarkers showed a significant
improvement with respect to randomly selected signatures
(bootstrap P ¼ 3.33 � 10 � 32; Supplementary Fig. 8). Taken
together, targeted proteomics quantification in post-DRE urine
samples is capable of identifying peptide signatures that are
superior to the current gold standard biomarker for prostate
cancer screening.
We next sought to examine whether our approach can be used
to address an important clinical challenge: to distinguish pT2
stage (OC) tumours from pT3 stage (EC) tumours, before radical
prostatectomy. Of note, our retrospective patient cohort B had
detailed clinical annotation, both at the stage of needle biopsy and
following surgical resection of the prostate (Supplementary
Table 1). It is hence important to note that all patients’ tumours
were staged as T2 via diagnostic needle biopsy, but up-staged to
pT3 following precise pathological examination of the surgical
specimen. From 100-fold bootstrapping, we selected seven
top-ranked peptides (6PGL, SERA, GELS, PEDF, PARK7, 1433S
and RINI; pink bars in Fig. 4d) as the most relevant biomarker
signatures to predict pT3 samples before radical prostatectomy
(that is, EPS urine samples were collected before surgery). From
the 10-fold cross-validation, the combination of these seven
features
showed
AUC
of
0.74
(95%
confidence
interval,
0.62–0.85), 69% accuracy, 39% sensitivity and 85% specificity
(Fig. 4e). In the test set, our predictive model achieved 74%
accuracy and an AUC of 0.77 (95% confidence interval, 0.74–0.80;
Supplementary Fig. 7b). Meanwhile, the single SPSA-based
approach achieved an AUC of 0.66 and a random model
achieved an AUC of 0.70 (10-fold cross–validation; Fig. 4e) and
0.69 (test set, Supplementary Fig. 7b). Our predictive model
significantly outperformed 100 random sets of seven peptide
signatures (bootstrap P ¼ 4.57 � 10 � 7; Supplementary Fig. 8).
These results suggest that targeted proteomics analyses in
clinically relevant tissue proximal fluids are capable of detecting
peptide signatures that predict prostate cancer stage independent
of needle biopsy and before surgical removal of the prostate.
Discussion
The timely verification of extensive lists of candidate disease
biomarkers generated by high-resolution proteomic technologies
is becoming increasingly feasible and necessary to identify
putative candidates. Despite this, the implementation of biomar-
kers into clinical practice is largely lagging behind. This is, in part,
attributed to the lack of validated methods of candidate testing
and further evaluation. Targeted proteomics by SRM-MS has
emerged
as
the
method
of
choice
for
candidate
protein
quantification and verification, due to its relatively low cost and
amenability to robust high-throughput assay development work-
flows26–28. The aim of the current study was to systematically
evaluate targeted proteomic assays in a clinically applicable,
yet to date rarely utilized tissue proximal fluid—EPS urine—
and
develop
liquid-biopsy
signatures
for
accurate
patient
classification.
This work is an extension of previously published proteomics
data in direct EPS from patients with EC and OC tumours18. The
feasibility of obtaining coordinates (peptide elution times and the
most intense fragment ions) from different modes of data
acquisition and instrumentation was demonstrated by extracting
relevant information from shotgun proteomics to lay the
foundation for targeted assay development using a triple
quadrupole mass spectrometer. By performing multiple rounds
of assay refinement and statistical evaluation, we narrowed over
200 promising candidates to 34 peptides with high biomarker
potential. Using heavy-isotope-labelled peptide standards, we
estimated and later absolutely quantified these candidates in
richly annotated cohorts of EPS urine samples.
Interestingly, a small number of peptides in EPS urine
overlapped with those that were previously explored in urine29.
The cancer-associated proteins that were evaluated in that study
were empirically gathered from reports based on protein and
nucleic-acid changes in human plasma and tissue29,30. In
contrast, we directly compared prostate-proximal fluids from
EC and OC tumour groups to derive biomarker candidates. We
previously demonstrated that post-DRE urine samples (EPS urine
samples) contain a unique subset of proteins, when compared
with matched urine samples from the same patient, supporting
our hypothesis that prostate-enriched proteins are released
as a result of the DRE19. Interestingly, applying a subset of our
SRM-MS assays to an independent cohort of prostate cancer
urine samples (non post-DRE urine samples) demonstrated that
the majority of peptides were not quantifiable and likely below
our detection limits.
A notable finding from the work presented here is the trend
towards lower abundance of the majority of candidates with
advancing disease. For instance, elevated serum levels of PSA are
indicative of prostate cancer; however, EPS levels of PSA have
been consistently lower in disease involving EC extension
(EC and/or pT3)18. Similarly, a trend of decreased PSA in EPS
urine from cancer patients compared with controls has been
noted by Drake et al.31. This may be indicative of PSA leakage out
of the prostate gland and into the circulation32 or by diminished
secretory functions that have been observed for high GS tumours,
a histology hallmark of which are smaller, rounder glands.
Similarly, it can be conceptualized that other proteins are
escaping the prostate and entering the circulation due to the
deteriorating structural integrity of advanced prostate cancers. It
would be beneficial to measure both EPS and serum levels of such
proteins from the same patient to further test this observation.
Although the majority of candidate expression levels were in
agreement between cohorts A and B, some differences were
noted. For instance, the protein ANXA3 has one peptide
(LTFDEYR) that is upregulated in the EC group of EPS urine
samples in cohort A, while the other peptide (SEIDLLDIR) is
downregulated in the EC group. This could be due to inaccurate
quantification, the presence of multiple proteoforms33, post-
translational modifications or variations in proteolytic digestion
efficiencies of endogenous proteins34,35 and warrant further
investigation using additional peptides.
To evaluate the effect of extra peptides from the same protein
on risk assessment, we examined the performance of our
predictors by adding these additional peptides. In cohort B,
there are six proteins (ANXA3, IDHC, PEDF, PRDX6, SERA and
NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | DOI: 10.1038/ncomms11906

7
 TGM4) that each have two unique peptides used in our SRM-MS
assays. Our original predictive models contained both IDHC
peptides and one SERA peptide (diagnostic model) and one SERA
peptide (prognostic model). We hence evaluated if adding the
second SERA peptide would change the performance of our
predictors. As it turns out, there is no significant performance
change between our original predictors (AUC of 0.79 for
diagnosis and 0.77 for prognosis) and the modified prediction
models using both peptides (AUC of 0.81 for diagnosis with P
value ¼ 0.18, AUC of 0.77 for prognosis with P value ¼ 0.97,
Student’s t-test; Supplementary Table 2). Indeed, the additional
SERA peptide has a low variable importance score. For example,
for the diagnostic analysis, the additional peptide ‘TLGILGLGR’
from SERA has a variable importance score of 17.04. Meanwhile,
the selected peptide ‘GGIVDEGALLR’ from SERA has a variable
importance score of 90.30 (average variable importance score is
37.21; Fig. 4b).
For the comparison between BPH and normal individuals from
cohort B, only the protein IDHC (peptide VEITYTPSDGTQK)
was found to demonstrate a significant increase in BPH. This may
be explained by the fact that the original discovery cohort18
lacked a non-cancer group consisting of BPH and normal
individuals. Furthermore, candidates who were selected from
cohort A for verification were not specifically aimed at verifying
their differential expression between BPH and normal EPS urine
samples. Future studies could be aimed at identification of
peptide signatures that accurately distinguish normal from BPH,
since this is a major limitation of SPSA measurements.
Although not obtained for the current study, additional
parameters such as tumour microenvironment measurements
may also provide information about patient outcome. Indeed, in a
recent study, intra-prostatic hypoxia was combined with DNA
indices (copy-number alterations) to robustly predict 5-year
biochemical recurrence (BCR)1. Such multi-feature signatures
may provide a comprehensive, powerful predictor of patient
outcome. Patients enrolled in cohort B of this study have clinical
information regarding BCR. In the pT2 group, 11 individuals out
of 61 developed BCR within 2 years post RP; in the pT3 group, 10
individuals out of 29 developed BCR. Although not yet explored
in this study, one approach to the analysis of the data may be to
comparatively analyse the protein expression changes between
individuals who developed recurrence and those that did not.
Our study is currently the largest investigation of prostate-
proximal fluids in the context of biomarker discovery utilizing
discovery proteomic data to design targeted proteomic assays.
While developed assays are subsequently evaluated across multi-
ple independent cohorts, substantial work is still required before
possible clinical application. This will include additional valida-
tion in independent patient cohorts, preferably using long-
itudinally collected samples, and additional assay optimizations36.
Furthermore,
alternative
approaches
such
as
analyses
of
extracellular vesicles37 or glycosylated proteins38,39 should be
applied for the discovery of prostate cancer biomarkers, ideally in
parallel to analyses of matching tissue specimens applying
carefully designed multi-omic/proteogenomic workflows40. Here
we provide the first work that utilizes SRM-MS for the systematic
identification of novel biomarker signatures for distinguishing
prostate cancer patient risk groups in a medium-sized cohort of
biofluid.
Methods
Sample collection and annotation. Samples were obtained from patients
following informed consent and use of Institutional Review Board approved
protocols at Urology of Virginia and Eastern Virginia Medical School (#06–12-FB-
0343) and the Research Ethics Review Board at the University Health Network
(10–0159-T). A measure of 20 ml of EPS urine was centrifuged at 1,100g for 15 min
at 4 �C to pellet debris. The resulting EPS urine supernatant was aliquoted in
volumes of 3.5 ml and diluted with 2.5 ml of PBS (pH 7.4). The mixture was
vortexed, combined and centrifuged at 1,100g for 15 min. The resulting super-
natants were stored at � 40 �C. Detailed clinical information for all patients
enrolled in this study are available (Supplementary Table 1). Prostate cancer
patients were selected on the basis of organ confinement or pathological stage.
Non-cancer individuals had biopsy-confirmed BPH or were considered as
individuals with no indication of prostatic disease based on the biopsy results.
Sample preparation for MS. Ultrapure-grade 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol, tri-
fluoroacetic acid, iodoacetamide and dithiotreitol (DTT) were from Sigma-Aldrich.
High-performance liquid chromatography-grade solvents (methanol, acetonitrile
and water) and formic acid were from Fisher Scientific. MS-grade trypsin/Lys-C
was from Promega (Madison, WI). Amicon spin filters, 0.5 ml, 3 kDa molecular
weight cut-off (MWCO), were from Millipore. Solid-phase extraction C18 tips were
from Agilent. A measure of 4 ml of EPS urine was concentrated to B500 ml using a
spin filter with a molecular weight cutoff of 3 kDa, and proteins were precipitated
overnight by the addition of ice-cold 100% methanol. Protein pellets were washed
twice with 100% methanol and air-dried. Protein resolubilization was performed by
the addition of 50% 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol at 60 �C for 2 h. Following reduction
with DTT and alkylation with iodoacetamide, proteins were digested overnight at
37 �C using 2 mg trypsin/Lys-C. The reaction was quenched by the addition of
trifluoroacetic acid. Desalting was performed by solid-phase extraction using C18
tips. Solvents were removed by vacuum centrifugation, and peptides were
resolubilized in 5% acetonitrile and 0.1% formic acid. Peptide concentrations were
determined by the micro-BCA assay kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific).
Selected reaction monitoring mass spectrometry. Samples were analysed on
a TSQ Vantage triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific)
equipped with an EASY-Spray (Thermo Fisher Scientific) electrospray ion source.
Separations were performed on EASY-Spray columns (15 cm � 75 mm ID packed
with 3-mm C18 particles, Thermo Fisher Scientific) heated to 50 �C. Peptides were
kept at 4 �C and loaded onto the column from an EASY-nLC (Thermo Fisher
Scientific) autosampler. Chromatographic conditions were as follows: 40-min
gradient at a flow rate of 300 nl min � 1 starting with 100% A (water), stepping up
to 5% B (ACN) in 5 min, followed by 25% B at 35 min, followed by a steep increase
to 50% B at 38 min and 100% B at 40 min. Targeted acquisition of eluting ions was
performed by the mass spectrometer operated in SRM-MS mode with Q1 and Q3
set to 0.7 m/z full width at half maximum resolution and a cycle time of 1 s. For
all SRM-MS runs, with the exception of the measurement of phase 3 peptides
from cohort B, multiple unscheduled injections were used, each targeting B200
transitions. For cohort B, a single scheduled method was utilized with a 2-min
elution window.
Selection of phase 2 peptides. In a previous study18, 133 differentially expressed
proteins were identified when comparing the proteome profiles of 16 direct EPS
samples from individuals with EC and OC prostatic tumours. A spectral library was
built from the resulting LTQ-Orbitrap XL data using the Skyline software tool
(version 2.1.0)41. All spectra had scores that passed a stringent peptide score as
determined by an X!Tandem target decoy search (B0.5% false discovery rate).
Protein sequences were converted to FASTA format and uploaded into Skyline for
the prediction of proteotypic peptides. Peptides were chosen based on the
previously reported specifications42. A total of 232 proteotypic peptides (phase 1
peptides) were selected and purchased as bulk heavy-isotope-labelled peptide
standards (JPT Peptide Technologies), also containing eight peptides that were
deemed potentially interesting from our additional EPS proteomics studies17,19,20.
To assess the suitability of the phase 1 peptides for SRM-MS, 250 fmol of each
heavy peptide standard was spiked into 1 mg of EPS urine digest, with four to six
transitions monitored over a 40-min chromatographic gradient. Of the 232 phase 1
peptides, 147 (phase 2 peptides) were reproducibly detectable with a minimum of
three transitions in the complex EPS urine background.
Quantification of phase 2 and selection of phase 3 peptides. A cohort of
individual EPS urine samples (n ¼ 74) from a heterogeneous population of patients
with EC, OC and control (BPH and normal; cohort A) was used to analyse all
phase 2 peptides. A total of 1 mg of peptide from each sample was spiked with
200 fmol of heavy peptide standards that were combined into six batches (batch
A–F), consisting of B20 peptides per batch. Visualization and inspection of peaks
were performed in Skyline. Each peptide was quantified in a sample by integrating
the quantifier ion (most intense ion) of the light peptide with its co-eluting heavy
peptide ion, to derive a light-to-heavy peptide ratio. The Student’s t-test was used
to compare the ratios between cancer and controls, as well as EC and OC prostate
cancers. A K-fold cross-validation was performed to investigate the diagnostic
and prognostic power of the peptides at different P value cutoff points. For the
diagnostic and prognostic peptide candidates, P value cutoff points of 0.05 and 0.1
were used, respectively. Further refinements to this list were made by including
additional peptides that did not meet the P value cutoff points, but were potentially
promising. For instance, peptides SSEDPNEDIVER from protein IGJ and
TPAQFDADELR from protein ANXA1 were added to the list of putative

 prognostic candidates because they were the only candidates that were elevated in
the EC tumour group (P value ¼ 0.25). Two KLK3 peptides (HSQPWQVLVASR
and LSEPAELTDAVK) were also added to monitor PSA levels in EPS urine. A
total of 34 peptides, comprising the phase 3 candidates (24 diagnostic and 14
prognostic peptides, of which four overlapped), were taken forward for verification.
Multiplexed SRM-MS. To increase throughput, a multiplexed SRM-MS assay was
developed by scheduling all 34 candidates in a single 40-min chromatographic
gradient. A total of three transitions were monitored for the light and heavy
versions of each peptide for a total of 204 transitions per analysis. A 2-min
acquisition time window was scheduled around the expected peptide elution time.
Verification of phase 3 peptides in EPS urine samples. For verification, a
heterogeneous population of patients with pathological stage pT3 and pT2 prostate
tumours, BPH and normal individuals (n ¼ 207) were enrolled (cohort B). An
amount of 1 mg of total peptide from each sample was spiked with 100 fmol of
heavy peptide and 10 fmol of corresponding light peptide for all candidates with
the exception of the KLK3 peptide, HSQPWQVLVASR, which was spiked in at
500 fmol of heavy peptide. Visualization and inspection of peaks were performed
on Skyline. Each sample was analysed in two technical replicates using the same
instrument parameters as described above.
Quantitative and statistical analyses. Each of the light and heavy peptides were
checked for the quality of data by observing co-elution of all three transitions,
alignment of light and heavy peptide elution times, and reproducibility between
technical replicates. Relative ratios of the AUC of the most predominant ion
(quantifier) of the light peptide versus the corresponding heavy quantifier were
calculated. To evaluate the reproducibility of proteomics data, we compared
peptide abundance in two replicates using Pearson’s correlation coefficient (R). On
average, peptides show the R of 0.97 across all samples. Of quantified peptides, 30
(88.24%), 28 (82.35%), 31 (91.18%) and 31 (91.18%) peptides show strong
reproducibility (R40.7) in normal controls, BPH, pT2 and pT3 samples,
respectively (Supplementary Fig. 2). Peptides were comparatively tested for
abundance differences between cancer versus normal and pathological stage
pT3 versus pathological stage pT2. All statistical analyses were performed in
R environment (v3.2.1).
Generating predictors for prostate cancer. To generate a predictor that
distinguishes cancer patients from control individuals (diagnosis), peptide
expressions of 90 cancer patients (positive set) and 48 normal controls
(negative set) were used. For the prediction of EC and OC cancers (prognosis),
29 pT3 samples (positive set) and 61 pT2 samples (negative set) were used
(Supplementary Table 3). All data sets (positive and negative sets) were divided
into two groups to build predictive models: a training set (90% of data set) and a
testing set (10% of data set). When 90% of the data set was used as a training set,
the predictive model was able to capture the properties of context classification
associated with patient risk groups and, thus, showed the maximum performance
on the testing set compared with other sized training sets (60% of data set and 80%
of data set; Supplementary Table 4). To examine the reliability of sample size
for the training, power analyses were performed (Supplementary Fig. 9). Power
analyses allow for the determination of the appropriate sample size for statistical
analysis. In general, there is a large difference effect between the two groups when
effect size is bigger than 0.5 at a power of 0.8 (ref. 43). In our study, at a power of
0.8, the effect sizes of the training sets are 0.79 (diagnosis, cancer versus normal
control, P ¼ 0.001) and 1.01 (prognosis, pT3 versus pT2, P ¼ 0.001). Power analysis
was performed using ‘pwr’ package (1.1–3) in R (version 3.2.1).
Machine learning and feature selection. The GLM was used to classify samples
into two classes: cancer versus normal (diagnosis) and pT3 versus pT2 (prognosis).
GLM is a widely used machine-learning algorithm that has been applied in various
types of biomarker identification (for example, cancer, HIV/AIDS and infection
diseases) with reliable performance44–46. In addition, we demonstrate that GLM
outperformed eight other machine-learning algorithms, which look for different
types of patterns and data properties; random forest (rf), stochastic gradient
boosting (gbm), Naive Bayes (nb), boosted generalized linear model (glmboost),
lasso and elastic-net-regularized generalized linear model (glmnet), support vector
machine with linear kernel (svmLinear) and radial basis function (RBF) kernel
(svmRadial). We generated predictive models using all peptides, tested them by 100
bootstrap samples and measured AUC, accuracy, sensitivity and specificity. As
shown in Supplementary Table 5, GLM shows relatively higher performance in all
performance metrics.
After collecting the data for all 34 peptides, we identified the best peptide
biomarkers to build predictive models. To do this, first, all peptide expressions
(abundances) were normalized against peptide expressions of normal controls:
Z ¼ X � m
s
Z is the normalized peptide expression, X is the peptide expression in each sample,
m is the mean of the normal controls and s is the s.d. of the normal controls.
We then examined inter-correlation between peptides. To do this, we generated
a feature–feature matrix by comparing expression profiles between peptides
(Supplementary Fig. 10a). There is low-expression similarity among all tested
peptides (median Pearson’s R is 0.15), suggesting that there is no inter-dependency
between tested peptides and they have their own prediction importance. Next, we
calculated the importance of each peptide to discriminate two classes (for example,
cancer and normal controls) and subsequently selected the top-ranked peptides
(from top 3 to top 15). We used these top-ranked peptides as features to build
predictive models. To avoid overfitting, 10-fold cross-validation was conducted on
a training set. We then examined their prediction performance on a testing set. To
obtain stable predictions, predictive models were tested by 100-fold bootstrapping.
The resulting average AUC was calculated and used as a performance measure.
Sets of top-ranked peptides that show the highest AUC were chosen as the most
relevant features. As a result, we selected six peptides for diagnosis and seven
peptides for prognosis as the most relevant features (Supplementary Table 6).
Peptides that were used as predictors also showed low-expression similarity.
Median Pearson’s R is 0.32 (cancer versus normal controls, Supplementary
Fig. 10b) and 0.18 (pT3 versus pT2, Supplementary Fig. 10c).
