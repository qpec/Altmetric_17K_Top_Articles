Alcoholic cardiomyopathy
The result of dosage and individual
predisposition
Alcoholism—use and abuse
According to the definition of the World
HealthOrganization(WHO),alcoholism
is subgrouped in two categories: alcohol
abuse and alcohol dependence [1]. This
corresponds roughly with the concept of
the American Psychiatric Association [2,
3]. Alcohol abuse describes the psycho-
logical dependence on ethanol for ad-
equate functioning together with occa-
sional heavy consumption, while alcohol
dependence is defined as an increased
alcohol tolerance together with physical
symptoms upon withdrawal. In Western
countries it is estimated that up to 10 %
of the adult population suffers from al-
coholism [4]. The highest prevalence is
detected in the third to fifth decade of
life, and alcoholism is seen in all races,
ethnic groups, and socioeconomic strata.
Germany with a total population of
81 million inhabitants is a permissive
society with respect to the drinking of
alcohol.
Alcohol consumption is part
of the local culture. About 40 million
individuals drink alcohol. The per capita
alcoholconsumptionof9.7lpureethanol
and the early onset of regular or episodic
intensive drinking among young people
in Germany consequently leads to high
alcohol-related morbidity and mortality
[5].
More than 1.8 million individuals
in Germany with a total population of
81 million inhabitants are alcohol de-
pendant. For an additional 1.6 million
persons the use of alcohol is harmful [6,
7]. In a world-wide setting, alcohol use
disorders show similarities in developed
countries, where alcohol is cheap and
readily available [8].
The many com-
plications of alcohol use and abuse are
both mental and physical—in particular,
gastrointestinal [9], neurological [10,
11], and cardiological [12, 13].
The
relationship of alcohol with heart dis-
ease or dementia is complicated by the
fact that moderate alcohol consumption
was shown not only to be detrimental
but to a certain degree also protective
against cardiovascular disease [14] or to
cognitive function in predementia.
We reviewed the effects of ethanol on
the cardiovascular system in 1996 [15],
including aspects of inflammation [16],
rhythm disturbances [17], and hyperten-
sion [18]. In 2001 we updated the data
on the ambivalent relationship between
alcohol and the heart [19] and in 2008
added new evidence on a larger cohort
of patients with different forms of car-
diomyopathy and increased alcohol in-
take from the German competence net-
work on heart failure [20].
This review revisits our past and deals
withourcurrentthinkingontheepidemi-
ology, pathophysiology, clinical charac-
teristics, and treatments available for al-
coholic cardiomyopathy.
Methods
This review assembles and selects per-
tinent literature on the ambivalent re-
lationship of ethanol and the cardiovas-
cularsystem, including guidelines, meta-
analyses,Cochranereviews,originalcon-
tributions, and data from the Marburg
Cardiomyopathy registry.

Examples for 100 % alcohol in ml of
one drink in consumed beverages are be-
tween 17.6 to 17.76 ml:
4 Beer: 12 fluid ounces of 5 % beer =
355 ml fluid = 17.5 ml 100 % alcohol.
4 Wine: 5 fluid ounces of 12 % wine =
148 ml fluid = 17.76 ml of 100 %
alcohol.
4 Distilled spirits: 1.5 fluid ounces of
~40 % liquor = 44 ml = 17.6 ml of
100 % alcohol.
A historical perspective
For more than 3000 years, alcoholic bev-
erages have been consumed in multiple
societies through the centuries and cul-
tures. The name alcohol is much younger
than the many beverages containing it.
Pulverized antimony was used as eye
shadow by Egyptian women and named
al-Kol. In the 16th century Paracelsus
Theophrastus Bombastus from Hohen-
heim used this term for distilled liquor
and called it alcohol [15]. The benefi-
cial cardiovascular effects of alcohol have
beenappreciated, e. g., inmedievaltimes,
when people took advantage of the va-
sodilating properties of alcohol to treat
anginapectorisorheartfailure. SoHilde-
gard von Bingen (1098–1179), one of the
most prominent mysticians of her time,
recommended her heart wine as a uni-
versal remedy.
One liter of wine was
cooked for 4 min with 10 fresh pars-
ley stems, 1 spoon of vinegar, and 300 g
honey and then filtered [11]. This recipe
is still in use today.
Over the centuries “the good and the
bad” of alcohol were evaluated clinically
and scientifically. As early as 1855, Wood
incriminated alcohol as a cause of heart
failure. In 1861, Friedrich reported id-
iopathic hypertrophy as associated with
alcoholism. In 1873, Walshe described
myocardial cirrhosis in alcoholics, which

includes a spectrum of hepatic derange-
ments that occur in the setting of right-
sided heart failure. Conversely cirrhosis
(fibrosis) was found both in heart and
liver. Highcardiacoutputinpatientswith
liver cirrhosis may have contributed to
this cardiomyopathy in a vicious circle.
The term “wine heart” (Tübinger Wein-
herz) originated in 1877 by Münzinger
[21], a German pathologist at Tübin-
gen university.
This entity we would
call nowadays “alcoholic cardiomyopa-
thy” with histologic features of dilata-
tion, myofibrillar necrosis and fibrosis
(. Fig. 1a), and ultrastructural changes
such as reduction of myofibrils and mi-
tochondriosis in a great variability of size
and form (. Fig. 1b; [22]).
In Munich, the annual consumption
of beer reached 245 l per capita and year
in the last quarter of the 19th century.
In 1884, the pathologist and veterinarian
Otto von Bollinger (. Fig. 2a) described
the “Munich beer heart” with fibrosis,
hypertrophy, and fatty degeneration in
postmortem cardiac tissue of alcoholics
who consumed an estimated average of
432litersofbeerperyear(. Fig.2b; [23]).
At that time every 10th necropsy in men
at the Munich pathology institute named
cardiac dilatation and fatty degeneration
as “Bierherz” being its underlying cause.
For comparison, the mean annual beer
consumption in Bavaria is nowadays es-
timated to be 145 l and in the rest of
Germany around 100 l beer per person
and year [24].
In 1887, Maguire reported on 2 pa-
tients with severe alcohol consumption
who benefitted from abstinence. He sug-
gested that alcohol was poisoning the
heart.
In 1890, Strümpell listed alco-
holism as a cause of cardiac dilatation
andhypertrophy, asdidSirWilliamOsler
in 1892 in his textbook Principles and
Practices of Medicine. In 1893, Graham
Steell, well known for the Graham Steell
murmur due to pulmonary regurgitation
in pulmonary hypertension or in mi-
tral stenosis, reported 25 cases in whom
he recognized alcoholism as one of the
causes of muscle failure of the heart. He
found it “a comparatively common one”
[25]. In his 1906 textbook The Study of
the Pulse, William MacKenzie described
cases of heart failure attributed to alcohol
and first used the term “alcoholic heart
disease” [26].
Inhis 1972 reviewarticle, Bridgenwas
the first to introduce the term alcoholic
cardiomyopathy [27].
Nutritional causes of “alcoholic”
cardiomyopathy
Beriberi heart disease
Thiamine deficiency is common feature
inamalnourishedand/oralcoholicpopu-
lation. Thus, theconceptofberiberiheart
disease dominated thinking about alco-
hol and the heart for decades and caused
many to doubt that alcohol was actu-
ally cardiotoxic [28].
But vitamin B1
(thiamine) deficiency is accompanied by
an elevated cardiac output and dimin-
ished peripheral vascular resistance [29,
30]. According to its central hemody-
namics, it can be classified as hyper-
dynamic cardiomyopathy or high output
failure with a cardiac output >8 l/min
or a cardiac index >3.9 l/min/m2 [31,
Herz 6 · 2016

 32]. In contrast, alcoholic cardiomyopa-
thy is characterized by a low cardiac out-
put, associated with systemic vasocon-
striction [4]. However, the high output
state can lead to cardiac dilation, thus,
representing a characteristic subentity of
cardiomyopathy different from low out-
put dilated cardiomyopathy. Therefore,
thiamine deficiency per se is just a his-
torical nutritional anomaly in the history
of alcoholic cardiomyopathy.
Manchester arsenic-in-beer
epidemic
In 1900, the Manchester arsenic-in-beer
epidemic was a serious food poisoning
outbreak affecting several thousand peo-
ple across the North-West and Midlands
ofEngland,withmanycasesprovingfatal.
The arsenic had come from the glucose
for which sulphuric acid was used in the
sugarproductionprocessofacompanyin
Leeds. Brewershadbeenusingthissugar,
thus, unknowingly poisoning the beer
and as a result their customers for many
yearsevenpriortotheepidemic[33]. Ar-
senic poising caused a multisystem dis-
ease in over 6000 cases with more than
70 deaths [34]. The syndrome included
the usual signs and symptoms of ar-
senic poisoning, with skin, nervous sys-
tem, and gastrointestinal manifestations.
Unusual in arsenic poisoning, but espe-
cially prominent in this epidemic, were
the cardiovascular findings. In his clin-
ical description, Ernest Reynolds wrote
that “cases were associated with so much
heart failure and so little pigmentation
that they were diagnosed as beri-beri
...”
. He also found that “undoubtedly
the principal cause of death has been
cardiac failure. In postmortem exami-
nations, the only prominent signs were
the interstitial nephritis and the dilated
flabbyheart”(p.169, [35]). Thisoutbreak
had been the first known trace metal car-
diotoxic syndrome.
In 2013, the issue of arsenic in beer
and wine was again prominent, when
MehmetCoelhan,aresearcherattheWei-
henstephan research center at the Tech-
nical University of Munich, reported at
a meeting of the American Chemical So-
ciety that many of the nearly 360 beers
tested in Germany had trace amounts of

Alcoholic cardiomyopathy. The result of dosage and individual
predisposition
Abstract
The individual amount of alcohol consumed
acutely or chronically decides on harm or
benefit to a person’s health. Available data
suggest that one to two drinks in men andone
drink in women willbenefit the cardiovascular
system over time, one drink being 17.6 ml
100 % alcohol. Moderate drinking can reduce
the incidenceand mortalityof coronary artery
disease, heart failure, diabetes, ischemic and
hemorrhagic stroke. More than this amount
can lead to alcoholic cardiomyopathy, which
is defined as alcohol toxicity to the heart
muscle itself by ethanol and its metabolites.
Historical examples of interest are the
Munich beer heart and the Tübingen wine
heart. Associated with chronic alcohol
abuse but having different etiologies are
beriberi heart disease (vitamin B1 deficiency)
and cardiac cirrhosis as hyperdynamic
cardiomyopathies, arsenic poising in the
Manchester beer epidemic, and cobalt
intoxication in Quebec beer drinker’s disease.
Chronic heavy alcohol abuse will also increase
blood pressure and cause a downregulation
of the immune system that could lead to
increased susceptibilityto infections, which in
turn could add to the development of heart
failure. Myocardial tissue analysis resembles
idiopathic cardiomyopathy or chronic myo-
carditis. In the diagnostic work-up of alcoholic
cardiomyopathy, the confirmation of alcohol
abuse by carbohydrate deficient transferrin
(CDT) and increased liver enzymes, and the
involvement of the heart by markers of heart
failure (e.g., NT-proBNP) and of necrosis
(e.g., troponins or CKMb) is mandatory.
Treatment of alcoholic cardiomyopathy
consists of alcohol abstinence and heart
failure medication.

Alkoholische Kardiomyopathie. Eine Folge der Dosis und der
individuellen Prädisposition
Zusammenfassung
Die individuelle Menge akut oder chronisch
getrunkenen Alkohols ist für den gesundheit-
lichen Schaden oder Nutzen entscheidend.
Grenzdosen für Männer sollten 1–2 Getränke
à 17,6 ml reinen Alkohols sein, für Frauen
ein Getränk. Mäßiger Alkoholkonsum kann
die Inzidenz und Mortalität von koronarer
Herzerkrankung, Herzinsuffizienz, Diabetes
mellitus, ischämischem und hämorrhagi-
schem Schlaganfall vermindern. Größere
Mengen Alkohol führen zur alkoholischen
Kardiomyopathie, bedingt durch die Toxizität
von C2H5OH und seinen Metaboliten auf
den Herzmuskel. Historische Beispiele sind
das Münchener Bier- und das Tübinger
Weinherz. Nicht auf die reine Alkoholwirkung
zurückzuführen sind aufgrund ihrer andersar-
tigen Ätiologie das Beriberi-Herz bei Mangel
an Thiamin (Vitamin B1) und die kardial
mitbedingte Leberzirrhose als hyperdyname
Kardiomyopathien, die Arsenvergiftung bei
der Manchester Biertrinkerepidemie und die
nach Quebec benannte Bierherzerkrankung
infolge einer Kobaltintoxikation. Chronischer
Alkoholabusus erhöht den Blutdruck und
verursacht eine Downregulation des Im-
munsystems mit erhöhter Infektanfälligkeit.
Histologisch ist die alkoholische nicht von der
idiopathischen Kardiomyopathie und einer
chronischen Myokarditis zu unterscheiden.
Alkoholabusus wird durch Bestimmung
des carbohydratdefizienten Transferrins
(CDT) und erhöhter Leberenzyme bestätigt,
die Herzinsuffizienz durch Biomarker wie
NT-proBNP und die Myozytolyse durch
Troponine und CKMb. Die Behandlung der
alkoholischen Kardiomyopathie besteht in
der Alkoholabstinenz und medikamentöser
Therapie der Herzinsuffizienz.

 arsenic. The source was identified to be
the filter of choice for wine and beer,
i.e., diatomaceous earth [36]. The Ger-
man word for it is Kieselguhr, a beige
powder made up of the skeletons of di-
atoms. The trace amounts of arsenic have
not been comparable to the arsenic-in-
beer endemic in Manchester but may still
reach up to 10-times the amount admit-
ted for arsenic in drinking water in the
European Union and the US.
Quebec‘s beer drinker disease
In the mid-1960s, another unexpected
heart failure epidemic among chronic,
heavybeerdrinkersoccurredintwocities
in the USA, in Quebec, Canada, and in
Belgium. It was characterized by con-
gestive heart failure, pericardial effusion,
and an elevated hemoglobin concentra-
tion. The explanation proved to be the
addition of small amounts of cobalt chlo-
ride. Cobalt was used as a foam stabi-
lizer by certain breweries in Canada and
in the USA. In 1966 McDermott et al.
[37] described the syndrome as myocar-
dosis with heart failure, Kestelott et al.
[38] added pericardial involvement and
named it alcoholic pericardiomyopathy,
and Morin and Daniel [39] in Quebec
trackeddowntheetiologytocobaltintox-
icationtowhatbecomeknownasQuebec
beer-drinkers cardiomyopathy. Human
pathologywasfirstdescribedbyBonefant
et al. [40]. Animal models investigated
ultrastructure [41] and treatment e. g. by
selenium [42]. Removal of the cobalt ad-
ditive ended the epidemic inall locations.
Cobalt poisoning and alcohol together
acted synergistically in these patients. As
the syndrome could be attributed to the
toxicity of this trace element, the additive
was prohibited thereafter.
Not alcohol but cobalt itself recently
caused severe heart failure in a 55-year-
old man, who was referred to the uni-
versity hospital in Marburg to rule out
coronaryarterydisease as the cause ofhis
heart failure. He had become almost deaf
and blind, with fever of unknown cause,
hypothyroidism, and enlarged lymph
nodes. Both his hips had been replaced,
the left side by a CoCrMo Protasul metal
prosthesis. Remembering a similar case
in an episode of the TV series Dr. House,
the team of J. Schäfer suspected cobalt
intoxication as the cause of heart failure,
which clinically mimicked Quebec‘s beer
drinker disease [43]. One should note,
however, that cobalt is needed in minute
amounts of 0.0003 mg/day in vitamin
B12 (cobalamine) to avoid megaloblastic
anemia.
Cardiac cirrhosis or cirrhotic
cardiomyopathy
The heart and liver interact in several
different ways. Acute or chronic right
heart failure leads to elevation of liver
enzymes most likely due to liver conges-
tion, whereas cirrhosis due to cardiac
disease is infrequent. Chronic liver dis-
ease such as cirrhosis may in turn affect
the heart and the whole cardiovascular
system, leading to a syndrome named
cirrhotic cardiomyopathy (CCM). Thus,
CCM has been introduced as an new
entity separate of the cirrhosis etiology.
Increased cardiac output due to hy-
perdynamic circulation, left ventricular
dysfunction (systolic and diastolic), and
certain electrophysiological abnormal
findings are pathophysiological features
of the disease. The underlying mecha-
nisms might include the impaired β-re-
ceptor and calcium signaling, altered
cardiomyocyte membrane physiology,
elevated sympathetic nervous tone and
increased activity of vasodilatory path-
ways [44]. In pathophysiological terms,
heart failure in liver cirrhosis belongs to
the hyperdynamic cardiomyopathies.
Hypertension
As early as in 1915, Lian [45] reported in
middle-aged French servicemen during
the first world war that heavy drinking
couldleadtohypertension. Ittookalmost
60 years before furtherattentionwas paid
to the complex interaction between the
heart and the peripheral vasculature in
various cross-sectional and prospective
epidemiologic studies, which have em-
piricallyconfirmedthisearlyreport. One
is aware today that alcohol may cause an
acute but transient vasodilation, which
may lead to an initial fall in blood pres-
sure probably mediated by the atrial na-
triuretic peptide (ANP) [46]. But also
short- and long-term pressor effects me-
diated by the renin–aldosterone system
and plasma vasopressin have been de-
scribed [47, 48].
The long-term hypertensive effect of
alcoholhasbeenconfirmedinmanystud-
ies [49–52]. Remarkably, alcohol also in-
teracts with brain stem receptors and ex-
erts thereby central hypertensive effects
[18]. The apparent threshold amount of
drinking associated with higher blood
pressure is approximately 3 drinks/day.
Most studies show no increase in blood
pressure with lighter drinking; several
show an unexplained J-shaped curve in
women with lowest blood pressures in
lighter drinkers. There seems to be inde-
pendence from adiposity, salt intake, ed-
ucation, smoking, beverage type (wine,
liquor, or beer), and several other poten-
tial confounders.
Clinical observation confirmed that
several days to weeks of drinking show
higher and weeks of abstinence lower
pressures. Alcohol intake may also in-
terfere with the drug and dietary treat-
ment of hypertension. This altogether
supports a causal relationship between
alcohol consumption and a hypertensive
state.
Alcoholic cardiomyopathy:
Cytotoxicity of alcohol
on heart muscle
The 1989 landmark report of Urbano-
Marquez et al. [53] showed a clear re-
lation of lifetime alcohol consumption
to structural and functional myocardial
and skeletal muscle abnormalities in al-
coholics. The amount of consumed al-
cohol was large—the equivalent of >80 g
alcohol/day for 20 years. Further evi-
dence came from data on acute alcohol
effects [54] and from clinical observation
[55–57].
In 1996, cardiomyopathies were de-
fined as diseases ”affecting the my-
ocardium with associated cardiac dys-
function“ [58] and primary and sec-
ondary forms were distinguished in this
context.
After consumption of large
quantities of alcohol over years the clin-
ical picture of heavy alcohol drinkers
could be indistinguishable from other
forms of dilated or familial cardiomy-

opathy.
Alcohol is still suspected to
be the major cause or contributory
factor of secondary nonischemic di-
lated cardiomyopathy being involved in
up to one third of all cases of dilated
cardiomyopathy [59–61].
In alcoholic
cardiomyopathy, dilation and impaired
contraction of the left or both ventri-
cles is observed [4].
Left ventricular
enddiastolic diameters are increased
compared to age- and weight-matched
controls [62], the left ventricular mass
index is increased [63], and the left ven-
tricular ejection fraction is well below
normal (<45 %). Thus, the diagnosis of
alcoholic cardiomyopathy is still based
on the coincidence of heavy alcohol
consumption and a global myocardial
dysfunction, which cannot be explained
by any other underlying myocardial dis-
ease [64]. However, the prevalence of
alcoholic cardiomyopathy may be un-
derestimated, as autopsy findings reveal
pathologic changes of the heart in indi-
viduals with no clinical symptoms [65],
when analyzing in large cross-sectional
studies.
Further evidence suggests that not
only ethanol but also the first metabolite
acetaldehyde may directly interfere with
cardiac and skeletal muscle homeostasis
[53, 66]. In vitro studies have further
elucidated the direct effect of ethanol
on electromechanical coupling, indicat-
ing a decrease in myofilament–calcium
sensitivity during alcohol consumption,
changes in the transmembrane action
potential, the amplitude of the cytosolic
calcium transients, and the shortening
of the action potential duration [67–71].
Isolated cardiomyocytes of alcohol-fed
rats did not maintain ATP levels upon
energy demand due to an inadequate
increase in mitochondrial ATP-synthase
activity, which led altogether to further
myocyte loss [72, 73]. Ultrastructural
disarray of the contractile apparatus [74]
is associated with a depressed myofib-
rillar and sarcoplasmic protein synthesis
in cardiac muscle after ethanol exposure
[75–77]. This reduces contractile car-
diac filaments with subsequent negative
inotropic effects on heart contractility
[78, 79]. An apoptotic effect of ethanol
on cardiac muscle has also been de-
scribed, which could be counteracted by
insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-I [80]
and confirmed in later studies [81, 82].
In a study in rats that were fed with
two different doses of alcohol (5 mM
[low alcohol], 100 mM [high alcohol]
or in pair-fed nonalcohol controls for
4–5 months), caspase-3 activity as puta-
tive marker of apoptosis was decreased
in the low alcohol diet, which went along
with increased or normal contractility,
whereas high doses of ethanol showed
increased caspase activity, wall thinning,
and a reduction of shortening velocity
[83]. Of note, rats are a relatively alcohol
resistant species.
Alcohol and myocarditis
Alcoholabusecoincidingwithmyocardi-
tis was reported in 1902 by McKenzie
[26]. Inendomyocardial biopsies ofalco-
holics up to 30 % of patients were found
to exhibit sparse lymphocytic infiltrates
with myocyte degeneration and focal
necrosis and increased HLA (human
leukocyte antigen) or ICAM (intercel-
lular
adhesion
molecule)
expression
(. Fig. 3; [16, 84]).
This may have to do with the suscep-
tibility for infections due to a suppressed
immune system in a compromised hu-
man host and also in experimental an-
imal [85].
Ethanol can alter lympho-
cytefunctions, inhibitneutrophilchemo-
taxis, and suppress the production of cy-
tokines, which are involved in regulating
acute inflammatory responses to infec-
tious challenges [86–88]. Furthermore,
autoimmunity and circulating autoanti-
bodies seem to be associated in some
patients with chronic alcohol consump-
tion [16, 20, 84].
Coronary artery disease and
atherosclerosis
The beneficial heart wine as universal
remedy in medieval ages by Hildegard
von Bingen [11] found its later corre-
lates in many observations at the begin-
ning ofmodernmedicine whencoronary
artery disease (CAD) and its risk factors
and symptoms received more attention.
Heberden [89] described angina so ele-
gantly in 1786 and also added that ”con-
siderable relief“ through ”wine and spir-
ituous liquors“ could be expected. This
observation led to the erroneous belief
thatalcohol is animmediate coronaryva-
sodilator. Alcoholisnotadirectcoronary
vasodilator [90]. Symptomatic relief of
488
Herz 6 · 2016
 angina could be through the anesthetic
effect of ethanol or through peripheral
vasodilation, which could transiently re-
duce oxygen demand of the heart.
In1819 the IrishphysicianDr. Samuel
Black, who had a special interest in
angina pectoris described what is proba-
bly the first commentary pertinent to the
”French Paradox“ [91]. This refers to the
finding in the last century that moderate
alcohol consumption could be the rea-
son for the relatively low cardiovascular
disease incidence in wine-drinking re-
gions [92]. Renaud and de Lorgeril [93]
suggested that the inhibition of platelet
reactivity by wine may be one explana-
tion for protection from CAD in France.
However, there was further evidence on
this and other dietary mechanisms with
the observation that France and Fin-
land have similar intakes of cholesterol
and saturated fat, but consumption of
vegetables and vegetable oil containing
monounsaturated and polyunsaturated
fatty acids is greater in France than in
Finland.
This inverse relation on mortality re-
sembles in most population based stud-
ies a U- or J-shaped curve: Total absti-
nence has a slightly increased mortal-
ity when compared to low or moder-
ate alcohol consumption. It is present
in individuals with and without overt
CAD, with diabetes, and with hyperten-
sion and has been underlined by a large
number of studies [94, 95].
The car-
dioprotective effect of alcohol can be at-
tributed tothe increase intotal high-den-
sitylipoproteins(HDL),andespeciallyby
an increase in subfractions HDL2 and
HDL3, whereas established cardiovascu-
lar risk factors like low-density lipopro-
teins (LDL) or lipoprotein(a) are thought
to be moderately decreased [96]. Mod-
erate alcohol intake also exerts beneficial
effects on the blood coagulation system.
Itleadstoanincreaseofendogenousplas-
minogen activators [97], or a decrease in
fibrinogen concentrations [98].
In the Caerphilly prospective heart
disease study, platelet aggregation in-
ducedbyadenosinediphosphatewasalso
inhibited in subjects who drank alco-
hol [99]. Assessing differences between
various forms of alcoholic beverages it
should be noted that resveratrol leads
in vitro to platelet inhibition in a dose-
dependent manner [100] and has shown
effects on all-cause mortality in a com-
munity-based study [101]. Polyphenols
of red barrique wines and flavonoids
have been shown to inhibit endothe-
lin-1 synthase [102] and PDGF-induced
vasoproliferation thus also contributing
to cardiovascular protection [103].
Signal transduction and beta-
receptors
In alcoholic cardiomyopathy,
similar
to idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy
(DCM), beta 1-adrenergic and mus-
carinic receptors are reduced in the
myocardium itself and reduced respon-
siveness of the adenyl cyclase was shown,
whereas catecholamine levels in the cir-
culation may be elevated [104]. As a net
effect, negative inotropism may result
and contribute to heart failure.
Arrhythmias and stroke
Acute effects of alcohol can result in
rhythm disturbances.
Since this hap-
pens often on weekends and holidays,
Ettinger and Regan coined the term ”hol-
iday heart syndrome“, when they de-
scribed 32 habitual drinkers with an ad-
ditional ingestion of ethanol prior to the
arrhythmia [59, 105]. Atrial fibrillation
wasthecommonestmanifestation, which
resolved with abstinence. In the Kaiser
Permanente Study, atrial arrhythmias in
1322 persons reporting >6 drinks perday
were compared to arrhythmias in 2644
matched light drinkers, showing a dou-
bledrelativeriskforheavydrinkers[106].
Apart from direct cardiotoxicity, hyper-
tensioncausing atrial stretchthe arrhyth-
mogenic potential of alcohol may come
from the lowering the resting membrane
potential [107] and the prolongation of
conduction [108].
Studies of alcohol and stroke are com-
plicated by the various contributing fac-
tors to stroke. Heavier drinkers are ap-
parently at a higher risk of hemorrhagic
stroke, whereasmoderatedrinkingmight
be neutral or evenresult in a reduced risk
of ischemic stroke.
Clinical work-up for alcoholic
cardiomyopathy
Habitualdrinkersoftenhidetheiralcohol
dependence fairly effectively. They may
admitdrinkingatsocialeventsbutnotthe
abuseinthefirstcontact. Patientswithal-
coholic cardiomyopathy, therefore, usu-
ally present with symptoms of heart fail-
ure, i. e., dyspnea, orthopnea, edema,
nocturia, and tachycardia. Echocardio-
graphy may reveal a mild or severe de-
pression of cardiac function and ejection
fraction or even show hypertrophy in the
beginning [109]. Heartfailure symptoms
maybeduetoearlydiastolicortolatersys-
tolic dysfunction. At later stages, due to
atrialfibrillation,thrombiarenotuncom-
mon in the dilated atria. Mitral regurgi-
tationis found inup totwothirds of cases
[110]. Atrial fibrillation and supraven-
tricular tachyarrhythmias are common
findings in 15–20 % of patients [111],
whereas ventricular tachycardias are rare
[112]. On ECG, unspecific abnormali-
ties like complete or incomplete left bun-
dle branch block, atrioventricular con-
duction disturbances, alterations in the
ST segment, and P wave changes can be
found comparable to those in idiopathic
DCM [113].
On endomyocardial biopsy, a dis-
crimination between idiopathic, chronic
inflammatory and alcoholic cardiomy-
opathy is virtually
impossible since
common features such as fibrosis, hy-
pertrophy of cardiac myocytes,
and
alterations of nuclei are present at light
microscopy in the alcoholic cardiomy-
opathy [114] as well as in chronic my-
ocarditis according to the Dallas criteria
[115] or the World Heart Federation/
International Society and Federation of
Cardiomyopathy (WHF/ISFC) defini-
tion of myocarditis [116]. Although the
severity of histological alterations on
endomyocardial biopsy correlates with
the degree of heart failure in one of our
studies, biopsy is not in common use
for prognostic purposes [117]. Even the
recovery after abstinence of alcohol is
hard to predict based on morphometric
evaluation of endomyocardial biopsies
[118].

Laboratory findings
Measuring blood alcohol concentration
in an acute intoxication gives baseline
information but does not permit deduc-
tions to chronic misuse.
Markers for
chronic alcohol consumptionrelyonliver
enzymes such as gamma-glutamyltrans-
ferase (GGT) [119], glutamic oxalacetic
transaminase(GOT),andglutamicpyru-
victransaminase(GPT).Elevationsofthe
transaminases (GOT, GPT), especially
a ratio of GOT/GPT higher than 2 might
be indicative of alcoholic liver disease in-
steadofliverdiseasefromotheretiologies
[120, 121]. An excellent marker is car-
bohydrate deficient transferrin (CDT),
which best detects chronic alcohol con-
sumptionalone[122, 123]orincombina-
tion with the other markers such as GGT
[8, 124]. Markers such as ethyl sulphate,
phosphatidyl ethanol, and fattyacid ethyl
esters are not routinely done. For a com-
prehensive overview see . Table 2 with
combined data from [6, 8, 24, 28].
Biomarkers of heart failure such as
NT-proBNP and of myocardial necrosis
suchasthetroponinsandCKMBindicate
heart failure or myocytolysis.
Is there an immediate risk of
alcohol intake?
In a recent meta-analysis, Mostofsky et
al. [125] analyzed if independent from
habitual moderate or heavy alcohol con-
sumption an immediate risks exists fol-
lowingalcoholintake. Datafrom23stud-
ies with 20,457 participants showed that
even with moderate consumption an im-
mediately higher cardiovascular risk was
attenuated after 24 h. It then became
protective for myocardial infarction and
hemorrhagicstrokewitha30 %lowerrisk
and protective against ischemic stroke
within one week. In contrast, heavy al-
cohol drinking continued to be associ-
ated with higher cardiovascular risk in
thefollowingday(RR=1.3–2.3)andweek
(RR =2.25–6.2).
Prognosis and treatment
Prognosis in individuals with low or
moderate consumption up to one or two
drinks per day in men and one drink in
women is not different from people who
do not drink at all. In CAD, diabetes,
and stroke prevention the J-type mor-
tality curves even indicate some benefit
apart from the social ”well-being“. In

patients with chronic alcohol use disor-
ders and severe heart failure prognosis
is poor, since continued alcohol abuse
results in refractory congestive heart
failure. Death might also be sudden due
to arrhythmias, heart conduction block,
and systemic or pulmonary embolism.
In these patients, only early and abso-
lute abstinence of alcohol can reverse
myocardial dysfunction [56, 57, 126]
which in a historic study by McDonald
and Burch was achieved with prolonged
bedrest for several months without fur-
ther access to alcoholic beverages. This
was an excellent result long before ACE
inhibitors or betablockers were avail-
able for heart failure treatment [57].
Mortality can otherwise reach 40–50 %
within a 4–5 year period in the non-
abstinent patients [127], whereas after
withdrawal from alcohol hemodynamic
and clinical improvement or at least
a slower progression of disease com-
pared to the idiopathic form of dilated
cardiomyopathy was shown [128, 129].
To maintain abstinence, recent inves-
tigations suggest the benefits of adjuvant
medications, e. g., naltrexone, which is
an opiate receptor antagonist that blocks
endogenous opioid reward and reduces
alcohol-cue-conditioned reinforcement
signals; acamprosate, an agent that ex-
erts action through excitatory amino
acids; by disulfiram, an aldehyde de-
hydrogenase inhibitor, which causes in
alcohol use acetaldehyde accumulation
and symptoms such as nausea, flushing,
sweating, and tachycardia or by selective
serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRI) [8,
130, 131].
To treat the alcohol prob-
lem, a combined approach comprising
pharmacologic and psychosocial therapy
involving self-help groups or Alcoholics
Anonymous is essential.
Treatment of alcoholic cardiomyopa-
thy follows the usual regimen for ther-
apy of heart failure, including ACE in-
hibitors, betablockers, diuretics includ-
ing spironolactone or eplerinone, and
digitalis in atrial fibrillation for rate con-
troltogetherwithanticoagulation, when-
ever appropriate (. Table 3). Caution for
anticoagulation is warranted due to the
problemsofnoncompliance, trauma, and
overdosageespeciallyinhepaticdysfunc-
tion.
Conclusion
The individual amount of alcohol con-
sumption decides on harm or benefit.
The preponderance of data suggests that
drinking one to two drinks in men and
one drink in women will benefit the car-
diovascular system over time. More than
this amount can lead to alcoholic car-
diomyopathy. Moderate drinking below
that threshold might even reduce the in-
cidence of coronary artery disease, dia-
betes, and heart failure.
