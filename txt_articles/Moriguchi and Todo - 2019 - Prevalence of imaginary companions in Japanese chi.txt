H
aving an imaginary companion (IC) is an example of children’
s pretend play. However, most research regarding
children’
s ICs is from Western cultures. In this study, the prevalence of ICs was assessed among Japanese children
(2- to 9-year-old children, N = 800). The developmental (age), biological (sex), and environmental (birth order) effects
on Japanese children’
s ICs were also assessed. Moreover, whether IC status can be an indicator of fantasy orientation
in Japanese children was examined. The results revealed that the prevalence of the invisible friend was relatively rare,
but the personified object was prevalent in Japanese children. Age and sex, but not birth order, significantly affected the
prevalence of ICs in Japan. Moreover, IC status significantly indicated children’
s fantasy orientation. The results suggest
that the characteristics of Japanese children’
s ICs are partly different from those in Western children. Social-cultural
contexts can affect this difference.
Keywords: Imaginary companion; Fantasy orientation; Pretend play; Japanese children.
Having an imaginary companion (IC) is a fascinating
example of children’
s pretend play (Gleason, 2004; Tay-
lor, Cartwright, & Carlson, 1993). An IC was originally
defined as “an invisible character named and referred
to in conversation with other persons or played with
directly for a period of time, at least several months,
having an air of reality for the child, but no apparent
objective basis.”(Svendsen, 1934 988). Recently, person-
ified objects (POs), in addition to invisible friends (IFs),
have been regarded as ICs when children treat objects
(e.g., puppets) as having human qualities (D. G. Singer
& Singer, 1990). It has been shown that about half of
preschool children play with ICs in Western countries. ICs
may play an important role in children’
s social and cogni-
tive development (Giménez-Dasí, Pons, & Bender, 2014;
Taylor, 1999; Taylor & Carlson, 1997), although there is
mixed evidence for the effects of ICs on theory of mind
(Davis, Meins, & Fernyhough, 2011; Lillard et al., 2013).
Most published research regarding children’
s ICs is
from Western cultures. Indeed, the concept of ICs is
prevalent in Western cultures, and children may have the
opportunity to see and hear the presence of ICs in books,
on TV, or via the people around them. Moreover, Western

parents may not discourage children from having ICs. In
Western cultures, parents may not provide children with
the idea of playing with an IC, but they generally support
their engagement with the ICs when children begin to play
with them (Taylor, 1999). Other researchers suggest that
Australian parents believe that ICs have either a positive
or no effect on their children, but they do not have negative
impressions of ICs (Bouldin & Pratt, 1999). Although
some Western parents may not support children having an
IC (Brooks & Knowles, 1982; Taylor & Carlson, 2000),
Western parents may facilitate children’
s play with ICs
(Taylor & Carlson, 2000).
Few studies have investigated children’
s ICs outside of
Western cultures. As Gaskins, Haight, and Lancy (2007)
argued, play is culturally constructed activities, which can
be affected by parental beliefs such as childrearing and
values. Thus, the prevalence of ICs can be affected by
socio-cultural contexts. In this regard, some researchers
have addressed the effect of culture on ICs (Motoshima,
Shinohara, Todo, & Moriguchi, 2014; Taylor & Carl-
son, 2000). Specifically, research from Asia, such as
Japan and China, has reported that IFs are relatively rare
in Asian children, whereas POs are relatively prevalent

(Lin, Fu, Wan, Zhou, & Xu, 2016; Moriguchi, Sakata,
Ishibashi, & Ishikawa, 2015; Moriguchi & Shinohara,
2012; Moriguchi, Shinohara, & Ishibashi, 2015; Moto-
shima et al., 2014). The sample size was relatively small
(at most, N = 160), and the age range of the children
was relatively narrow (e.g., 3–6 years) in previous stud-
ies. Thus, it remains unclear whether ICs are prevalent in
Asian cultures.
In the present study, we extended upon the findings
of previous studies and addressed three issues regard-
ing Japanese children’
s ICs. First, we collected large data
from a wider age range. The sample size in previous stud-
ies was generally small, which may affect the reported
prevalence of ICs in Asian children. In this study, we col-
lected data from 800 children of different age groups, and
assessed the prevalence of ICs in the Japanese population.
Second, we addressed whether age, sex, and birth order
were correlated with the prevalence of the Japanese chil-
dren’
s ICs to address the developmental (age), biological
(sex), and environmental (birth-order) effects on Japanese
children’
s ICs. It is well known that preschool children
are more likely to have ICs than are older children (Tay-
lor, 1999). Moreover, some researchers have proposed a
peak prevalence of children’
s ICs at 4 years (Manosevitz,
Prentice, & Wilson, 1973). Nevertheless, the age range
included in previous studies is narrow (e.g., 4–6 years),
and whether preschool children are more likely to have
ICs compared to other children is unclear. In the Western
data, Pearson et al. (2001) examined whether age affected
the prevalence of children’
s IFs in children of a wider age
range (5–12 years). They found that the peak age of the
children who had an IC currently was 6 years. Neverthe-
less, their sample did not include younger children (e.g.,
ages 3 and 4). Moreover, they only assessed the preva-
lence of IFs, but did not include the prevalence of POs.
Thus, the present study included children aged 2–9 years
of age, and examined whether young children are more
likely to have ICs as compared to older children.
In terms of sex, there might be sex differences in types
of pretend play. That is, girls are more likely to have
ICs than are boys, whereas boys tend to impersonate a
character, such as Spiderman (Carlson & Taylor, 2005;
Mottweiler & Taylor, 2014). Girls may achieve such a
feeling by caring about the IC. Previous Western studies
have generally demonstrated an effect of sex on IC (Tay-
lor, 1999). Thus, we assessed the sex effects on ICs in
Japanese children. Moreover, we assessed social environ-
mental effects of Japanese children’
s ICs focusing on birth
order. First-born children or only children engage in IC
play more often than other children do (Gleason, Sebanc,
& Hartup, 2000). This may be because the creation of an
IC compensates for the lack of a real companion (Taylor,
1999). We aimed to replicate the findings in the Japanese
population.
Third, we assessed the relationship between children’
s
IC status and fantasy orientation to address whether IC
status is an indicator of fantasy orientation in Japanese
children. Fantasy orientation refers to individual tenden-
cies to think and play in a fantastical context (D. G. Singer
& Singer, 1990; Taylor et al., 1993). Previous Western
studies have reported that children with high fantasy ori-
entation often engage in pretend play including IC play
(Taylor & Carlson, 1997; Taylor et al., 1993), but the
correlations between IC status and fantasy orientation
are weak to moderate (Gleason, 2004; Pierucci, O’
Brien,
McInnis, Gilpin, & Barber, 2014). Moreover, Lin et al.
(2016) reported that IC status was not significantly corre-
lated with fantasy orientation in Chinese children. Given
that previous evidence, we hypothesized that IC status is
weakly correlated to fantasy orientation in Japanese chil-
dren. We tested the hypotheses.
In sum, we hypothesized that IFs would be relatively
rare, but POs would be relatively common in the Japanese
population. Moreover, age, sex, and birth order would
be related to the prevalence of Japanese children’
s ICs,
as they are in Western children. Finally, IC status would
be weakly correlated with the fantasy orientation in the
Japanese population.
METHOD
Participants
We conducted a cross-sectional internet-based survey
among a randomly selected sample from a database that
included 33,876 parents with children aged 2–9 years
(Cross Marketing Inc., Tokyo, Japan). A minimum sam-
ple size of 243 (with 95% power to detect an effect)
was calculated with an a priori power analysis using
medium effect sizes. We assumed that 800 participants
(100 parents per age) would be adequate for validity
and robustness of results. During recruitment, 987 par-
ticipants agreed to participate. Out of these, 894 partic-
ipants completed the questionnaire about their children’
s
IC. We used the data of the first 100 parents (50 parents
of first-born children and 50 parents of second-born chil-
dren) in each age category to complete the study.
Participants consisted of 800 parents living in Japan
(328
fathers
and
472
mothers;
Mage = 38.8 years,
SD = 5.3, range: 22.0–55.0 years) and 800 children
(416 boys and 384 girls; Mage = 71.4 months) from 2 to
9 years of age (100 children per age category). Given
the sex effects and birth-order effects in the previous
studies, we included approximately equal numbers of
boys and girls, and exactly equal numbers of first-born
children and second-born children. The details of the
children’
s information are presented in Table 1. Informed
consent was obtained from the participants prior to their
involvement in the study. The study was conducted in
accordance with the principles of the Declaration of
Helsinki, and the study design was approved by the local
ethics committee.

Stimuli and procedure
Questions used in the online questionnaire are reported in
Appendix S1, Supporting Information. The online ques-
tionnaire consisted of three parts. In the first part, par-
ents were asked to complete the background information
described above (e.g., parent’
s age, children’
s age and
sex). In the second part, parents completed the question-
naire about ICs. In the third part, parents were given a
questionnaire about their children’
s fantasy orientation.
In this questionnaire, participants had to answer all ques-
tions in each part. Otherwise, they could not go to the next
section.
IC questionnaire
In the second part, parents were asked questions their
children’
s ICs. Asking parents about their children’
s ICs
is a traditional method to assess children’
s ICs (Bouldin
& Pratt, 1999; Manosevitz et al., 1973). Researchers have
noted some problems in the assessment method. For
example, parents do not know the details (e.g., personality
of the IC) of children’
s ICs (Taylor, 1999). However,
Gleason (2004) reported that children’
s reports and parent
reports did match when they were asked about whether
children had an IC. Therefore, we asked the parents about
their children’
s ICs.
The questions were derived from our offline question-
naire (Motoshima et al., 2014). First, an IC was defined
as a very vivid imaginary character who does not actually
exist but is treated as real by the child and who interacts
with the child during his or her play and daily activities.
Examples were given of both POs and IFs. Then, par-
ents were asked if their child has had an IC similar to
the examples for more than 1 month. Specifically, parents
were asked to explicitly choose whether their child has
an IC currently or in the past. We regarded children as
having an IC if they had the IC for more than 1 month,
because the length of the period varied across previous
studies (e.g., 2 months), and we used the shortest defi-
nition (i.e., 1 month, Gleason et al., 2014) in this study.
We had a particular interest in age-related changes in
children’
s current IC. If parents answered the questions
affirmatively, those whose children had an IC proceeded
to provide the following information: (a) number of ICs;
(b) age of the child when the IC appeared and disap-
peared; (c) age, name, appearance, and personality of the
IC; (d) scenes and activities in which the IC was engaged;
and (e) child’
s attitude toward the IC. If children had mul-
tiple ICs, parents were asked to answer questions (c), (d),
and (e) about the IC children had for the longest. The
questions were based on Taylor and Carlson (1997).
To establish the validity of the online questionnaire,
we compared the IC status of a subsample of the current
study to parents who completed the offline questionnaire.
We additionally invited 43 parents with 4-year-old chil-
dren (Mage = 53.6, SD = 3.6), and asked them to complete
the offline questionnaire. The parents were all mothers,
and therefore, we compared their responses to 60 moth-
ers with 4-year-old children who completed the online
questionnaire. The results revealed that 20 out of 43 moth-
ers who completed the offline questionnaire and 26 out of
60 mothers who completed the online questionnaire indi-
cated the current presence of a PO, whereas 4 and 6 moth-
ers, respectively, indicated the current presence of an IF.
Chi-square analyses did not reveal significant differences
in the relative numbers of POs, χ2(1, N = 103) = 0.102,
p = .749, or IFs, χ2(1, N = 103) = 0.014, p = .906. These
results support the validity of the online questionnaire.
Fantasy orientation
In the third part of the study, parents answered ques-
tions about their children’
s fantasy orientation. The
questions about fantasy orientation were derived from
previous studies (J. L. Singer, 1973; Taylor & Carl-
son, 1997). There were nine questions: six consisted of
open-ended questions about the child’
s favourite solitary
game, favourite game with other children, favourite story,
favourite toy, favourite TV show, and favourite play
activity. The other three questions were forced-choice,
addressing the child’
s tendency to impersonate animals,

the questions affirmatively, they were asked to describe
the contents of the behaviours.
Two coders assessed the parental answers to the
six
open-ended
questions
and
classified
them
as
fantasy-oriented
or
reality-oriented.
Some
previous
studies coded children’
s responses as realistic, repre-
sentational, and fantastical (Boerger, Tullos, & Woolley,
2009). However, our questions about fantasy orien-
tation were based on Taylor and Carlson (1997), and
accordingly, we used their coding schema. For example,
children’
s answers about favourite story were coded as
either fantasy-oriented (e.g., “Frozen”) or reality-oriented
(e.g., animal stories). Interrater reliability based on 25%
of the data showed high agreement for each question: a
question on the child’
s favourite solitary game (Cohen’
s
k = .94), a question on the child’
s favourite game with
other children (k = .98), a question on the favourite
story (k = .80), a question on the favourite toy (k = .91),
a question on the favourite TV show (k = .93), and a
question on the favourite play activity (k = .95). When
the two reviewers disagreed in their classifications, the
third coder assessed the response.
If a parent’
s answer was regarded as fantasy-oriented,
it received a score of 1. If the three forced-choice ques-
tions were answered in the affirmative, a score of 1
was assigned. We calculated the total fantasy orientation
scores (range: 0–9).
RESULTS
Descriptive data for ICs for each variable
First, we found no significant differences in the percent-
age of children who had ICs reported by fathers (21.3%)
and mothers (27.8%), χ2(1, N = 800) = 3.478, p = .062.
Moreover, parental age did not affect children’
s IC status
(t < 1.0). Thus, the data of both parents were combined for
the subsequent analyses. We separately report children’
s
current IC status as well as past IC status, although our
main focus was current IC status. The data are presented
in Table 1.
We examined whether IFs relatively were rare in the
Japanese children. Overall, of the 800 children, 190
(23.8%) were reported as having a current PO, and 160
(20%) as having a past PO. In terms of IFs, 31 (3.9%)
and 43 children (4.3%) had an IF currently and in the
past, respectively. The relative significance of POs com-
pared to IFs in Japanese children is consistent with the
results in previous studies (Motoshima et al., 2014). The
mean number of POs was 3.24 (range: 1–10). One hun-
dred and twenty-five (35.7%) children with POs had only
one PO, 109 (31.1%) had two, 73 (20.8%) had three, and
43 (12.3%) of children had four or more. Other detailed
information about children’
s POs is presented in Table 2.
The mean number of IFs was 1.99 (range: 1–10).
Forty-one (55.4%) children with IFs had only one, 19
(25.6%) had two, 10 (13.5%) had three, and 4 (5.4%) had
four or more. Other detailed information about children’
s
IFs is presented in Table 2. The results generally support
our hypotheses that IFs are rare in Japanese children.
Modelling ICs
We examined whether age, sex, and birth order predict IC
status. Specifically, we considered children’
s current IC
status, and did not include children’
s past ICs because a
previous study showed that the prevalence of ICs did not
differ by age when past and current ICs were included
(Pearson et al., 2001). We would like to understand the
age-related changes in current ICs, and accordingly, we
focused on current ICs. Past ICs were regarded as children
without ICs in the analyses below. Moreover, given the
small proportion of IFs, we combined PO and IF and
report the whole IC measure in the analyses below.
We used log-linear models, which treat the natural log-
arithm of observations as a linear combination of main
effects and interactions. We tested several models and
found that the best fit to our data was provided by a hierar-
chical model that included interactions between age and
IC status and between sex and IC status, G2(46) = 57.225
p > 0.124. The Akaike information criterion (AIC) was
much improved in this model (AIC = 93.224) than in the
saturated model that included all possible interactions and
main effects (AIC = 128.00).
This analysis highlighted the importance of the inter-
actions between age and IC status and between sex and
IC status, indicating that age and sex separately pre-
dicted IC status in this sample. Girls were more 2.6
times more likely than boys to have ICs, z = 5.696,

s age.
p < .001. In terms of age, we found an interesting devel-
opmental trajectory (Figure 1). That is, the proportion
of children who had an IC increased between 2 and
4 years of age, but after 4 years of age, the propor-
tion linearly decreased until 9 years of age. Statistically,
our analysis set the 2-year-old children as the refer-
ence point, and compared them to older children. We
found a marginal effect such that 4-year-old children were
1.8 times more likely than were 2-year-old children to
have ICs, z = −1.913, p = .056. In contrast, 7-, 8-, and
9-year-old children were 1.9 times, 2.7, and 4.7 times
less likely to have ICs, respectively, than were 2-year-old
children (z = 2.717, p = .007; z = 3.602, p < .001, respec-
tively), although the difference between 2-year-old chil-
dren and 7-year-old children was marginally significant
(z = 1.821, p = .069). We found no significant differences
in the proportion of ICs between 2-year-old children
and 3-, 5-, and 6-year-old children (z = −1.055, p = .291;
z = −0.309, p = .757; z = 0.800, p = .423, respectively).
The results revealed that 4-year-old children were more
likely to have an IC than were other children.
Taken together, the results partially support our
hypotheses. Age and sex, but not birth order, were
correlated with IC status in the Japanese population.
ICs and fantasy orientation
We tested whether IC status would indicate fantasy orien-
tation in Japanese children. First, we examined whether
the type of parent (i.e., mother vs. father) affected the
reported children’
s fantasy orientation. There was a
significant effect of the type of parent, t(798) = −3.695,
p < .001, showing that mothers (M = 3.14, SD = 1.69)
evaluated children’
s fantasy orientation higher than
fathers did (M = 2.71, SD = 1.53). Thus, we included
this variable in the analyses of the relationship between
IC status and fantasy orientation. Parental age was not
significantly correlated with the fantasy orientation,
r(800) = −.06, p = .09.

Raw correlations between variables are reported in

between age, current IC status, and fantasy orientation,
after adjusting for sex, birth order, and parental status. We
found a significant negative relationship between age and
fantasy orientation, and a positive correlation between IC
status and fantasy orientation, r(795) = −.252 and .306,
respectively, both ps < .001.
Next, we conducted a hierarchical regression analyses
to examine whether age and IC status predicted fantasy
orientation. We entered sex, birth order, and parental sta-
tus in step 1, and then entered age and IC status in step 2
as potential predictors of fantasy orientation. In step 1,
significant predictors were sex, b = .760, SE b = .112,
b* = .231, p < .001, and parental status, b = .467, SE
b = .114, b* = .140, p < .001, but not birth order, b = .108,
SE b = .112, b* = .033, p > .338. In step 2, significant pre-
dictors of fantasy orientation were age, b = −.132, SE
b = .024, b* = −.184, p < .001, and IC status, b = .852, SE
b = .128, b* = .225, p < .001.
DISCUSSION
In the present study, we collected data from a large sam-
ple of a wide age range of Japanese children. Descriptive
statistics revealed that the data in this sample were con-
sistent with previous Asian studies, showing that IFs are
relatively rare and POs are relatively prevalent in Japanese
children compared to Western children (Moriguchi & Shi-
nohara, 2012; Motoshima et al., 2014). The results sug-
gest that socio-cultural contexts may affect children’
s
imaginative play. Gaskins et al. (2007) proposed that
parental beliefs about childrearing and values can affect
children’
s imaginative play. Indeed, in Western society,
parents may not discourage play with the ICs because they
believe that an IC has a positive, or at least neutral, effect
on imagination and creativity (Taylor, 1999), although
some parents show a negative attitude toward ICs (Brooks
& Knowles, 1982). On the other hand, the concept of ICs
does not seem prevalent in Japanese cultures, and there-
fore, parents may be anxious about their children having
IFs. Kawato (2001) reported that the Japanese parents
were more willing to consult with someone when their

children had an IF compared to when their children had a
PO, because the parents worried about children’
s reports
about IFs. This may be inconsistent with the fact that
Japanese parents may be positive about pretend play in
general (Tamis-LeMonda, Bornstein, Cyphers, Toda, &
Ogino, 1992). Thus, it is possible that Japanese parents
were specifically negative about IFs among pretend play
(importantly, not negative about POs), which may lead to
low proportions of IFs in Japanese children.
The second issue we addressed was whether the devel-
opmental (age), biological (sex), and environmental (birth
order) factors affected the prevalence of Japanese chil-
dren’
s ICs. The analyses using log-linear models revealed
that a hierarchical model including interactions between
age and IC status and between sex and IC status best
fit our data. The results suggest that sex and age were
independently correlated with IC prevalence. In terms of
age, our analyses revealed that 4-year-old children were
marginally more likely to report ICs than were 2-year-old
children, and 7-, 8-, and 9-year-old children were less
likely to have ICs than were 2-year-old children. Thus,
we found an inverted-U shaped development in the preva-
lence of ICs. The findings would extend previous findings
about age effects on children’
s ICs. Previous studies have
generally shown that preschool children are more likely
to have ICs compared to other populations (Taylor, 1999).
However, the age ranges of the previous studies were nar-
row. Even in a study that included a wider age range,
younger children such as those aged 3 and 4 were not
examined (Pearson et al., 2001). Thus, the present study
showed that preschool children, and especially 4-year-old
children, are more likely to have ICs compared to other
children. Previous Western studies have suggested that
4 years can be a peak age for children’
s pretend play
(Manosevitz et al., 1973). Our results indicated that the
findings can be extended to the Japanese children.
One possible interpretation of the age effects is that
4 years is the peak age for children to talk about ICs with
their parents, but not for children to have ICs. In this
regard, a previous Western study has shown that the preva-
lence of current ICs gradually decreased as a function
of age in children aged 5–12 years, based on children’
s
own reports (Pearson et al., 2001). Nevertheless, it is still
unclear whether the same is true in Japanese children,
which should be addressed in future studies by assessing
Japanese children’
s reports on ICs.
We also showed that girls were more likely to have ICs
than boys in the Japanese population. Thus, sex may be
reliably correlated with children’
s IC status across cul-
tures. One possible interpretation is that sex differences
may be due to differences in timing (e.g., boys may have
an IC at an older age; Taylor, 1999). However, our results
did not support this interpretation. We examined children
aged 2–9 years of age, and our analyses showed that sex
was a significant factor that can explain the prevalence of
ICs irrespective of age. Thus, our results may support the
view that the sex differences can reflect the content of pre-
tend play, where girls may achieve a feeling of mastery by
caring about the IC, whereas boys may impersonate an
imaginary character and obtain the feeling through cre-
ating an ideal self (Harter & Chao, 1992). We need to
consider children’
s impersonation as well as IC to inves-
tigate children’
s role play (Taylor & Mannering, 2006).
On the other hand, we found no birth-order effects
on children’
s ICs, which is inconsistent with previous
studies. One possible interpretation is that our children
included first-born and second-born children only. In con-
trast, previous studies included first-born children and all
other children, such as those who were third-born. This
difference may be one reason for the different results
across studies.
The third issue we examined was the relationship
between current ICs and fantasy orientation. The results
revealed that IC status significantly predicted children’
s
fantasy orientation, although the effect size was relatively
small as expected. ICs are generally regarded as one fac-
tor that may affect fantasy orientation (Taylor & Carlson,
1997). Our analyses revealed that ICs may affect chil-
dren’
s fantasy orientation after adjusting for age, sex, birth
order, and evaluator status (i.e., mother vs. father) in the
Japanese population.
It should be noted that some previous studies failed
to detect a significant relationship between IC status and
fantasy orientation (Gleason, 2004; Lin et al., 2016). One
possible factor is the differences in sample size between
studies. Gleason (2004) reported marginal differences
in fantasy orientation between children with and with-
out ICs, showing that children with POs showed the
highest fantasy orientation, followed by children with
IFs and children with no ICs. The sample size was
88, which was not enough to detect the differences
between groups. Moreover, the assessment method dif-
fered across studies. In the previous studies, both children
and parents answered questions about children’
s ICs, and
children answered questions about fantasy orientations.
On the other hand, our study assessed both measures
using parental reports, which may have prompted par-
ents to answer both questions similarly. We must examine
whether the results can be replicated when asking chil-
dren about their ICs and fantasy orientation. Moreover,
we need to conduct cross-cultural comparisons to assess
the cultural effects on the results.
In this study, we used an online questionnaire to col-
lect data from a diverse sample. This method has strengths
and weaknesses. It can be useful to collect data not only
from Japan but from all over the world, and compare
the results across cultures. Thus, it would contribute to
our understanding of general developmental trends with
regard to children’
s ICs across cultures. However, we may
not be able to collect exact descriptions about children’
s
ICs (how children represent ICs) using an online ques-
tionnaire, as younger children cannot directly respond to

the online questionnaire. The problems would be similar
to the offline questionnaire method. Thus, in that case, we
should directly ask children about their ICs.
One issue that should be addressed in future studies
is the relationship between IC status and social/cognitive
development in Japanese children. Previous Western data
have shown that ICs may support children’
s social and
emotional development. For example, children who have
ICs may develop better social cognitive skills (e.g., theory
of mind) compared to those without ICs (Taylor & Carl-
son, 1997), although previous studies did not assess the
specific relationship between IFs and the performances of
the false belief tasks. Interestingly, Japanese children may
perform worse compared to children in other cultures in
verbal false belief tasks (Moriguchi, Okumura, Kanakogi,
& Itakura, 2010). There are several interpretations regard-
ing worse performance in Japanese children. For example,
Moriguchi et al. (2010) suggested that experimental set-
tings can underestimate Japanese children’
s performance.
Nevertheless, it is possible that the lower proportion of IFs
may be related to the worse performance of the false belief
tasks in Japanese children. Future research should address
this issue by addressing how children’
s IFs are related to
children’
s false belief understanding both in the Western
and the Japanese children.
One limitation of the study was that the results might
be specific to parents who can use Internet. In this study,
parents completed online questionnaires about children’
s
ICs. In Japan, more than 90% of people aged between
their 20s and 50s use the internet daily (Japan Minister of
Internal Affairs and Communications, 2015). Neverthe-
less, it is possible that there might be differences between
people who use the internet and those who do not.
We should assess whether the same results emerge when
using an offline questionnaire. Second, we did not include
questions about participants’ SES (socio-economic sta-
tus). SES may affect participants’responses. This should
be assessed in future research. Third, we did not ask
participants (parents) in this study about whether chil-
dren may have cognitive or psychological problems;
however, we validated the online questionnaire using an
offline questionnaire. The participants in the offline ques-
tionnaire were parents of typically developing children.
Therefore, it is unlikely that children with cognitive or
psychological problems strongly affected the results in
this study. Nevertheless, we should assess such informa-
tion in future studies using an online questionnaire. Forth,
the low proportion of IF may be due to our definition
of IC. Our definition was an imaginary character who
interacts with the child during his or her play and daily
activities. However, some children talk about, but do
not interact with, their IF. Our definition may exclude
such children, which may lead to the low proportion of
IF. Despite the limitations, the present study clarified
the characteristics of Japanese children’
s ICs. We will
conduct direct comparisons between the Western and the
Japanese children’
s ICs in future studies.
