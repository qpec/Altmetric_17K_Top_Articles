The purpose of this investigation was to determine the effects of a high protein diet over a one-year period. Fourteen healthy
resistance-trained men completed the study (mean ± SD; age 26.3 ± 3.9 yr; height 178.5 ± 8.4 cm; and average years of training
8.9 ± 3.4 yr). In a randomized crossover design, subjects consumed their habitual or normal diet for 2 months and 4 months and
alternated that with a higher protein diet (>3 g/kg/d) for 2 months and 4 months. Thus, on average, each subject was on their
normal diet for 6 months and a higher protein diet for 6 months. Body composition was assessed via the Bod Pod�. Each subject
provided approximately 100–168 daily dietary self-reports. During the subjects’ normal eating phase, they consumed (mean ± SD)
29.94 ± 5.65 kcals/kg/day and 2.51 ± 0.69 g/kg/day of protein. This significantly increased (𝑝 < 0.05) during the high protein phase
to 34.37 ± 5.88 kcals/kg/day and 3.32 ± 0.87 g/kg/day of protein. Our investigation discovered that, in resistance-trained men that
consumed a high protein diet (∼2.51–3.32 g/kg/d) for one year, there were no harmful effects on measures of blood lipids as well as
liver and kidney function. In addition, despite the total increase in energy intake during the high protein phase, subjects did not
experience an increase in fat mass.
1. Introduction
It has been postulated that the consumption of a high protein
diet may cause harmful effects, particularly in the kidneys.
Approximately a century ago, investigators found “at least
some or very severe” renal damage in a small group of rats on
a high protein diet in which one kidney had been removed [1].
Other work on rodents found no evidence of renal damage;
however, they did find that rats receiving a high protein diet
experienced renal hypertrophy [2]. Notwithstanding, a more
recent rat study reported that 30 days of very high whey pro-
tein supplemented diet (i.e., 6 human-equivalent 20 g doses
per day) did not adversely affect blood and/or histological
markers of liver or kidney health and instead may improve
liver health when compared to rats not receiving protein [3].
The challenge with determining the effects of high protein
diets on measures of health is the lack of agreement with
what constitutes a “high” intake of protein. At least in athletic
populations, the International Society of Sports Nutrition’s�
position stand on protein states that “protein intakes of
1.4–2.0 g/kg/day for physically active individuals is not only
safe, but may improve the training adaptations to exercise
training” [4]. Furthermore, scientists have used different
definitions of “high” protein intakes. For instance, protein
intakes greater than 15-16% of total energy, as high as 35%
of total calories, or intakes that exceed the RDA have been
postulated as reaching the threshold of what constitutes a
“high protein” diet [5]. We would posit that basing a diet on
percentages is misleading. That is, if one were to consume a
hypoenergetic diet of 1000 kcal in which 35% of the calories
were derived from protein, then that would amount to a
paltry 87.5 grams of protein. Instead, high protein diets should
always be defined as the amount of protein consumed per
unit body weight. It is our contention that high protein diets
should necessarily exceed 2.0 g/kg/d. Previous work from our
laboratory discovered that an eight-week period of heavy
resistance training coupled with high protein consumption
(>3.0 g/kg/d) results in improvements in body composition
[6]. Furthermore, at least in the short term, high protein

intakes had no harmful side effects [6, 7]. However, long-term
longitudinal data are lacking in terms of the effects of high
protein diets. Thus, the purpose of this investigation was to
examine the effects of high protein consumption in a group
of resistance-trained young males over a 1-year period.
2. Methods and Materials
2.1. Participants. Fourteen resistance-trained male subjects
volunteered for this investigation (racial/ethnic background:
10 white males, 3 black males, and 1 Pacific Islander). Subjects
took part in a randomized crossover trial in which they
consumed their habitual (i.e., normal protein) or high protein
diet for two months and four months, respectively. The order
in which they consumed their normal or high protein intakes
was randomized. Subjects followed their normal and high
protein intake phases for a total of 6 months, respectively.
Subjects came to the laboratory on five occasions. They
were tested at baseline and then subsequently after two 2-
month periods and two 4-month periods of following the
respective diet. The extra protein consumed by each subject
was obtained primarily from whey protein powder, which was
provided to each subject at no cost (Dymatize� ISO-100 with
25 grams of protein, 1 gram of carbohydrate, and zero grams
of fat per serving of one scoop). However, subjects did not
have to consume the extra protein as powder; instead, they
could consume whatever extra protein source they preferred.
Nova Southeastern University’s Human Subjects Institutional
Review Board in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration
approved this study and written informed consent was
obtained prior to participation.
2.2. Food Diary. Subjects kept a diary (i.e., three days per
week for one year) of their food intake via a smartphone
app (MyFitnessPal) equaling ∼150 daily food logs over the
treatment period. The use of mobile apps for dietary self-
reporting has been previously used [6–9]. Every subject had
previous experience with this mobile app. The MyFitnessPal
app is a database comprised of over 5 million foods that
have been provided by users via entering data manually
or by scanning the bar code on packaged goods. Thus,
the data themselves are primarily derived from food labels
(i.e., nutrition facts panel) derived from the USDA National
Nutrient database.
2.3. Body Composition. Height was measured using standard
anthropometry and total body weight was measured using
a calibrated scale. Body composition was assessed by whole
body densitometry using air displacement via the Bod Pod
(COSMED USA, Concord, CA). All testing was performed
in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions. Subjects
were instructed to come into the lab after a 3-hour fast and no
exercise 24 hours prior to assessment. They voided prior to
testing. Subjects were tested while wearing only tight fitting
clothing (swimsuit or undergarments) and an acrylic swim
cap. Subjects were instructed to wear the same clothing for
all testing. Thoracic gas volume was estimated for all subjects
using a predictive equation integral to the Bod Pod software.

Each subject was tested at least twice per visit. Data from
the Bod Pod include body weight, percent body fat, fat-free
mass, and fat mass. All testing was done with each subject
at approximately the same time of day for each of the five
testing sessions. Although hydration status was not assessed,
each subject was tested in an identical manner throughout the
investigation. The Bod Pod was calibrated the morning of the
testing session as well as between each subject.
2.4. Blood Analysis: Comprehensive Metabolic Panel and Blood
Lipids. Subjects presented in a fasted state at a local Quest
Diagnostics� facility on five separate occasions. A blood
lipid and comprehensive metabolic panel was done. This
includes the following measures: glucose, blood urea nitrogen
(BUN), creatinine, glomerular filtration rate, BUN/creatinine
ratio, sodium, potassium, chloride, carbon dioxide, calcium,
total protein, albumin, globulin, albumin/globulin ratio, total
bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, alanine transaminase, aspar-
tate transaminase, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein
cholesterol, triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol,
and the total cholesterol to high-density lipoprotein choles-
terol ratio. Quest Diagnostics performed each test according
to the standard operating procedure of the company.
2.5. Training Program. Each subject followed their own
strength and conditioning program. The investigators were in
regular contact with each subject to ensure that each subject
completed a training log. The volume load (i.e., total weight
lifted per week) was determined for each treatment period.
2.6. Statistics. A 2-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was
used to analyze the data with 𝑝
<
0.05 considered as
significant. The data that were compared were baseline and
the mean of the normal treatment period [combined 2-
month and 4-month treatment] as well as the mean of the
high protein treatment period [combined 2-month and 4-
month treatment]. Data are expressed as the mean ± SD. The
statistical analysis was completed using Prism 6 GraphPad
Software (La Jolla, California).

during the high protein phase (𝑝 < 0.05). There were no
significant differences between the normal and high groups
in any measure of health or body composition (Tables 3 and
4). It should be noted that one subject completed 6 months
on the high protein phase and only 2 months on the normal
protein phase. He did not complete the final 4 months of the
normal protein phase due to geographic relocation. Thus, for
this particular subject, we compared the mean of his normal
(2 months of data) and high protein phases (6 months of
data).
4. Discussion
This is the first randomized controlled trial that has exam-
ined the effects of a high protein diet in resistance-trained
subjects over a 1-year treatment period. In brief, we found
no deleterious effects of a high protein diet (2.51–3.32 g/kg/d)
over a 1-year period. Prior work from our lab has shown
that consuming a high protein diet in the short term has no
harmful effects on any clinical measure (i.e., blood lipids and
comprehensive metabolic panel) [6, 7].
The subjects in the current investigation alternated
between their normal or habitual protein intake and a high
protein intake. It should be noted however that even their
normal protein intake would be considered high by other
investigators [5, 11, 12]. Thus, our study does not support the
notion that protein intakes 3-4 times greater than the current
RDA cause any harmful effects.
Moreover, the amount of dietary fiber consumed by our
subjects was ∼30 grams per day. This is in contrast with the
average fiber intake in the United States of ∼16 grams per
day [13]. Thus, it is a falsehood to promote the idea that high
protein diets are mutually exclusive with a diet that is also
high in fiber. Our subjects showed no harmful effects of a
hyperenergetic, high protein diet and this (i.e., blood lipids,
renal and hepatic function, etc.) may have been due partially
to their fiber intake. It is known that higher fiber intakes
are associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular disease,
cancer, and all-cause mortality [14–16]. On the other hand,
the cholesterol intake of our subjects was twice as high as the
typical recommendation of 300 mg per day [17]. The notion
that high cholesterol intakes have a deleterious effect on blood
lipid markers of cardiovascular disease is not supported by
our data.
Prior work from our laboratory has shown that consum-
ing protein (2.3–3.4 g/kg/d) in amounts that are 3-4 times
greater than the RDA results in a similar FFM increase
for both the normal and high protein groups [6]; however,
the high protein group lost more fat mass compared to the
normal protein group in spite of the fact that they consumed
on average ∼400 kcals more per day over the treatment
period. This is in contrast with the current study that showed
no change in body composition. The primary difference
between the current study and the aforementioned one is
that subjects in the current study did not purposely alter
their training program. On the other hand, subjects in our
previous study were subjected to a different training stimulus
(i.e., periodized resistance-training program) than they had
been accustomed to. Inasmuch as the focus on our current
work was on the markers of health, subjects in the current
study were instructed to not alter their training regimen. An
examination of their volume load shows indeed that they did
not make any significant alterations in training volume. Thus,
one would speculate that, without significant changes in the
training stimulus, the mere provision of extra protein would
likely not lead to changes in body composition. Conversely,
the mere addition of extra protein calories also will not lead
to gains in fat mass.
4.1. Limitations. One might speculate that a limitation of
this investigation is that the subjects were young males who
had several years of resistance-training experience and were
regularly consuming a high protein diet at baseline. However,
the fact that they increased their protein intake by ∼32%
and still had no deleterious side effects is further evidence
that a high protein diet in exercise-trained individuals is
indeed safe. The small sample size may also preclude one
from applying the results from this study to other populations
(i.e., sedentary men or women). Nonetheless, we would posit
that the only populations that would consume a high protein
diet are athletes (e.g., highly trained endurance and strength-
power athletes). Thus, the need to apply our data to other
populations may be a moot point.
5. Conclusions
In male subjects with several years of experience with
resistance training, chronic consumption of a diet high in
protein had no harmful effects on any measures of health.
Furthermore, there was no change in body weight, fat mass,
or lean body mass despite eating more total calories and
protein. Contrary to popular belief, the consumption of a
high protein diet is not mutually exclusive with a diet high
in fiber nor does the consumption of cholesterol above the
standard recommendations result in any untoward effects on
