Abstract
Higher monetary diet cost is associated with healthier food choices and better weight management. How changes in diet cost affect changes in
diet quality and weight remains unknown. The aim of this study was to assess the impact of changes in individual monetary diet cost on
changes in diet quality, measured by the modified Mediterranean diet score recommendations (MDS-rec) and by energy density (ED), as well
as changes in weight and BMI. We conducted a prospective, population-based study of 2181 male and female Spaniards aged between 25 and
74 years, who were followed up to the 2009–2010 academic year. We measured weight and height and recorded dietary data using a validated
FFQ. Average food cost was calculated from official Spanish government data. We fitted multivariate linear and logistic regression models. The
average daily diet cost increased from 3·68 (SD 0.0·89)€/8·36 MJ to 4·97 (SD 1·16)€/8·36 MJ during the study period. This increase was
significantly associated with improvement in diet quality (Δ ED and Δ MDS-rec; P < 0·0001). Each 1€ increase in monetary diet cost per 8·36 MJ
was associated with a decrease of 0·3 kg in body weight (P = 0·02) and 0·1 kg/m2 in BMI (P = 0·04). These associations were attenuated after
adjusting for changes in diet quality indicators. An improvement in diet quality and better weight management were both associated with an
increase in diet cost; this could be considered in food policy decisions.
Key words: Diet cost: Diet quality: Weight gain: Prospective studies
A healthy diet is paramount for physical and mental health(1,2),
and improving population diets was declared a priority area of
action at the United Nations High Level Meeting on Prevention
and Control of Non-Communicable Diseases(3). Diet quality
depends on personal food choices, which are driven by
food prices as well as by culture, taste and convenience(4).
Epidemiological evidence indicates that better diet quality is
associated with higher diet costs(5). Furthermore, higher price
indices for fruits and vegetables were linked to higher BMI in
children aged 2–9 years(6).
From 2000 to 2010, diet costs increased disproportionately in
European countries, with the greatest increases in South
European countries such as Spain (31·2 %) compared with
17·2 % in Germany or 20·6 % in Sweden(7). During that same
decade, food prices rose more sharply in Spain for healthy food
choices compared with less healthy foods(8). The cost of foods
low in energy density and rich in nutrients, such as fruits,
increased
by
51·0 %,
whereas
pastries
or
confectionery
products, high in energy density but low in nutrient density,
increased by 10·1 and 23·1 %, respectively. High-density energy
consumption has been related to low nutrient adequacy(9,10),
weight gain(11) and risk of obesity(12).
It is unknown how increases in individual diet cost, driven by
rising food prices, affects consumers’ food choices and,
consequently, overall diet quality. Therefore, the aim of the
present study was to analyse the prospective association
between changes in individual diet cost and changes in
diet quality in a representative Spanish population. In addition,
we determined the impact of changes in diet cost on body
weight.

 Methods
Participants
Data were obtained from a population-based survey conducted
in Girona (Spain) in 2000 and 2009. The baseline survey
examined a randomly selected, population-based sample of
3058 men and women aged 25–74 years (participation rate:
71·0 %). Of the 3058 participants in the baseline survey in 2000,
2715 non-institutionalised participants who still resided in the
catchment area in 2009 were invited to participate in the follow-
up study (online Supplementary Fig. S1), and 2181 of these
individuals attended the re-examination in 2009–2010. This
represents a 19·7 % loss to follow-up after 10 years, resulting in
an acceptable follow-up rate of 80·3 %. Finally, 3·2 % (n 69) of
the participants had missing dietary data at baseline or at
follow-up and were excluded from the analysis. The final
sample size included 2112 participants with complete follow-up
data. Participants were duly informed and signed their consent
to participate in the study. The project was approved by the
local Ethics Committee (CEIC-PSMAR, Barcelona, Spain).
Dietary assessment
Food consumption was determined using a validated FFQ,
administered by a trained interviewer at baseline and at
follow-up(13,14). In a 166-item food list including alcoholic and
non-alcoholic beverages, participants indicated their usual con-
sumption and chose from ten frequency categories ranging from
never or less than once per month to six or more times per d.
Monetary diet cost
Food prices were obtained from the food price database of the
Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness(8). The
average prices for many food items (not including commercial
fast foods) are updated every month in this database. For this
study, we calculated food prices for 2000 and 2010, based on
the average cumulated prices reported for each of those 2 years.
Prices were not available for the following foods (2 %): paella,
cannelloni and pizza. Prices for fast food items were obtained
by a search of corporate websites. Individuals’ daily diet cost
and the monetary diet cost per 8·36 MJ of energy intake/d
(hereinafter, energy-adjusted diet cost) were calculated.
Measurement of diet quality
Diet quality was determined by adherence to the Mediterranean
diet and by measuring the energy density of the daily diet. We
chose these two indices of diet quality from among the numer-
ous available indicators because of their good construct validity
and established association with health outcomes(9–12,15–17).
Modified
Mediterranean
diet
score
recommendations.
Assessing adherence to the Mediterranean diet by a score based
on population-based food consumption distribution is, by
definition, specific to a particular population, making it difficult
to compare results between studies. To overcome the limitation
regarding comparability of results, we calculated the modified
Mediterranean diet score recommendations (MDS-rec) as pre-
viously described(18). In brief, consumption that meets recom-
mended intakes for Spanish adults of cereals, fruits, vegetables,
legumes, fish, olive oil, nuts and dairy products is coded as 3,
consumption at least weekly as 2 and less than weekly as 1 for
legumes, fish and nuts; for the other groups (cereals, fruits,
vegetables, olive oil, dairy products), consumption at least daily
was coded as 2 and less than daily as 1. For meat (including red
meat, poultry and sausages) and dairy products, the score was
partially
inverted,
with
consumption
more
than
weekly
coded as 1, weekly as 2 and meeting the recommended con-
sumption as 3. Moderate red wine consumption (up to 20 g/d)
was coded as 3, and more or less than this daily portion was
coded as 1.
Energy density. After considering the different methods of
calculating energy density(18), we decided to present data on
the basis of a dietary density calculation that includes only food
items. Foods and beverages have different effects on satiety and
energy intake, which in turn affects the association between
energy density and body weight(19,20). Therefore, total energy
density of the diet was calculated by dividing total energy intake
from food consumed each day by the total weight of the
reported food intake.
Anthropometrics
Measurements were performed by a team of trained nurses and
interviewers who used the same standard methods in both
surveys. A precision scale of easy calibration was used for
weight measurement with participants in underwear. Body
weight was rounded up to the nearest 200 g and height was
measured to the nearest 0·5 cm. BMI was calculated by (weight
(kg)/height squared (m2)). Body weight and BMI changes were
defined as the difference between the weight and BMI recorded
in 2010 and at baseline in 2000, respectively.
Energy misreporting
Individuals with implausible reported energy intake (rEI) were
identified by the revised Goldberg method, as described pre-
viously(21). BMR was estimated using the Mifflin equation(22).
The rEI:BMR ratio was calculated. The plausibility of rEI was
estimated by comparing the rEI:BMR ratio with physical activity
levels (PAL). The cut-off values to identify plausible rEI were
taken as the confidence limits of agreement between rEI:BMR
and PAL, and were based on the CV of participants’ energy
intake, the accuracy of the BMR measurements and the total
variation in PAL, as proposed by Black(23).
Other variables
The validated Minnesota Leisure-Time Physical Activity (LTPA)
questionnaire(24,25) was administered by a trained interviewer.
Smoking habits and demographic and socio-economic variables
were obtained from structured standardised questionnaires
administered
by
trained
personnel.

 dichotomously categorised as non-smokers (never smokers and
ex-smokers with more than 1 year of smoking cessation) and
current smokers (including ex-smokers with less than 1 year of
smoking cessation). Maximum education level attained was
elicited and dichotomously recorded for analysis as primary
school v. secondary school or university.
Statistical analysis
General linear modelling procedures were used to compare
baseline participant characteristics by quintiles of changes in diet
cost and to analyse changes in food group consumption
according to low and high changes in energy-adjusted diet cost
(1st v. 5th quintile). ANOVA test and polynomial contrasts
were used to determine overall P and Pfor linear trend, respectively,
for continuous variables with normal distribution, and the
Kruskal–Wallis test was used to determine overall P for
non-normal distributions. Pfor linear trend for categorical variables
was
obtained
by
the
Mantel–Haenszel
linear-by-linear
association χ2 test.
Linear regression models were fitted to analyse the associa-
tion between changes in energy-adjusted diet cost and changes
in MDS-rec, energy density, weight and BMI. Two models were
fitted. The first included three variables: sex (men/women,
dichotomous), age (years, continuous) and the corresponding
baseline exposure variable. The second added six variables:
smoking (yes/no, dichotomous), energy intake (MJ, con-
tinuous), educational level (more than primary school yes/no,
dichotomous),
LTPA
(metabolic
equivalents,·min/d,
con-
tinuous) and energy under- and over-reporting (both yes/no,
dichotomous). The normality assumption of regression models
was assessed by the normal probability plot. In addition, linear
regression models including secular trends in diet quality as the
exposure variables and changes in diet cost were fitted.
Substitution models were fitted to analyse changes in diet
quality by the effect of replacing the changes in monetary costs
of red meat and sausages, fast food and soft drinks, fish, cereals,
dairy products and pastry with the changes in the price of
vegetables and fruits. For this purpose, changes in monetary
costs of vegetables and fruits were included simultaneously
with red meat and sausages, fast food and soft drinks, fish,
cereals, dairy products and pastry in multivariate linear
regression models. The difference in the coefficients from these
models was used to estimate the effect on changes in diet
quality indices of replacing a 1€ increase in energy-adjusted diet
costs of red meat and sausages, fast food and soft drinks, fish,
cereals, dairy products and pastry with a 1€ increase in
vegetables and fruits.
Cubic spline analysis was performed to investigate non-linear
associations between changes in the energy-adjusted diet cost
and changes in weight and BMI using the ‘gam’ package in
R version 3.0.2. The assumption of normality in the regression
models was assessed using the normal probability plot.
To
explore
effect
modification
according
to
sex,
we
modelled interaction terms for sex/weight change and sex/BMI
change. Differences were considered significant if P < 0·05.
Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 18.0
(SPSS Inc.).
Results
Daily diet cost increased during the follow-up by 35·1 %
(online Supplementary Table S1). Substantial differences in
energy-adjusted diet cost were observed between low and high
diet
quality
at
baseline
and
at
re-examination
(online
Supplementary Table S1). No significant effect modification by
sex was observed (P > 0·1).
In the bivariate analysis, changes in energy-adjusted diet cost
were positively associated with the proportion of women, age,
BMI,
energy
consumption
and
energy
over-reporting
(online Supplementary Table S2). The opposite was true for
energy under-reporting.
Differences in the changes observed in food group con-
sumption according to a decrease (1st quintile of changes) and
an increase (5th quintile of changes) in energy-adjusted dietary
costs are shown in online Supplementary Fig. S2. Participants
who strongly increased energy-adjusted diet cost increased
their consumption of vegetables, fruits, fish and red meat and
sausages and decreased the consumption of pastry, cereal
products, soft drinks and fast food. The opposite was observed
for those participants who decreased energy-adjusted diet cost.
The strongest effect was seen for vegetables and fruits.
Diet quality increased with increasing energy-adjusted diet
cost (Table 1). Changes in the MDS-rec were directly associated
with
increasing
energy-adjusted
diet
costs,
whereas
the
opposite was found for energy density (Table 1). The latter
showed the strongest association with changes in energy-
adjusted diet cost.
An increase of 1€ in energy-adjusted diet cost was associated
with a decrease of 0·3 kg in body weight and 0·1 kg/m2 in BMI.
These associations were no longer present when the models
were adjusted for energy density (Table 2).
Associations between changes in energy-adjusted diet cost
and changes in weight and BMI were tested for non-linearity,
but no significant evidence was found (P for curvature of
changes in weight and BMI = 0·47 and 0·33, respectively).
Replacing a 1€ increase in the energy-adjusted monetary cost
of red meat and sausages, fast food and soft drinks, pastry and
cereals with 1€ increase in vegetables and fruits significantly
increased the MDS-rec (Table 3) and decreased energy density.
Discussion
An increase in the energy-adjusted diet cost predicted a shift to
a healthier diet and to better weight management. Diet quality
strongly increased when money previously spent on unhealthy
food choices such as fast food and pastry was instead spent on
vegetables and fruits.
A recently published meta-analysis(5) concluded that healthier
diets are more expensive than less healthy diets. The authors
found a difference of $1·54/8·36 MJ per d between extreme
quintiles of diet quality, defined by a nutrient-based dietary pat-
tern. The monetary cost of a healthy dietary pattern, defined post
hoc by cluster analysis, was twice the price of the least healthy
pattern in the UK Women’s Cohort Study(26). Monsivais et al.(27)
reported that strong adherence to the Dietary Approaches to Stop
Hypertension diet was 0·78$/8·36 MJ more expensive than low

 adherence to this dietary pattern. In the present study, the
energy-adjusted diet cost for high diet quality was 2·95€ ($3·33)/d
higher than low diet quality; this amounts to 1076€ ($1215)/year
for one person who chooses high diet quality. One might
hypothesise that this would negatively influence healthy food
choices, particularly in low-income families.

 We used two conceptually different indices to measure
overall diet quality: food-based and energy density, which we
have shown to be good indicators of diet quality in the present
population(9,10). Our prospective results indicate that reducing
diet cost has detrimental effects on diet quality. This was true for
both indicators of diet quality, underlining the robustness of
our data.
In the present study, an increase in energy-adjusted diet cost
of 1€ represented a 54·5 % difference between the 2nd and 4th
quintiles in energy-adjusted diet cost changes. The change from
a strong decrease to a strong increase in diet quality measured
by adherence to the Mediterranean diet and energy density was
associated with an increase of 0·42€ and 1·98€ in the
energy-adjusted diet cost, respectively. For both diet quality
scores, the percentage difference and percentage increase in
energy-adjusted diet cost between the strong decrease and
strong increase was 133 and 400 %, respectively.
The price of healthy foods increased to a greater extent than
that of less healthy foods in Spain between 2000 and 2010(8),
and price is an important determinant for food choices(4).
Individuals and families facing economic constraints may be
especially likely to reduce their consumption of more expensive
foods, regardless of their contribution to diet quality. In
addition, it is not surprising that a strong decrease in diet cost
in the present study was concomitant with a dramatic decrease
in the consumption of fruits and vegetables.
On the other hand, fast food and soft drinks consumption
increased in participants who greatly reduced their diet cost.
This is of particular concern because soft drink and fast food
consumptions are associated with less healthy dietary patterns
and
weight
management
in
the
present
population(28).
Moreover, low diet quality is responsible for 17 % of disability-
adjusted life years in the USA(29). Low consumption of fruits and
vegetables is one characteristic of this low diet quality. Our
substitution models convincingly show the positive effect on
diet quality of replacing 1€ ($0·86) increments of dietary costs in
pastry and soft drinks and fast food with 1€ increases in fruits
and vegetables. These data underline the paramount role of
fruit and vegetable consumption in a healthy diet. Moreover,
our data raise the question of food price intervention using tax
policy and subsidies. Evidence indicates that a rise in prices of
unhealthy foods and a price reduction for healthier alternatives
improve overall diet quality(4,30,31).
Following
the
Mediterranean
dietary
pattern
and
low
energy-dense diets have been frequently associated with better
weight management and reduced risk of obesity(11,18,32).
Therefore, and based on the present results, we hypothesised
that changes in diet cost would affect body weight. Our analysis
showed a direct relationship between a decrease in diet cost
and weight gain. This association was mainly explained by diet
quality; adjusting for changes in diet quality strongly attenuated
the impact of increased diet cost on weight gain.
This study has both limitations and strengths. Owing to the
nature of observational studies, causal relationships cannot be
drawn. Furthermore, all the dietary instruments that measure
past food intake are vulnerable to random and systematic
measurement errors. Although the 10-year loss to follow-up of
19·7 % in the present study can be considered acceptable, there
was some evidence of selection bias among the participants
who completed the follow-up in that they were generally
younger and more likely to be female. Variation of monetary
cost of food due to regions, seasons, and types of establishment
where the food was purchased is a potential bias for the ana-
lysis of the impact of diet cost on diet quality. In the present
study, we used yearly averages of food prices across multiple
regions of Spain, which somewhat reduced this limitation.
Furthermore, we do not have data on food consumption away
from home. Our analysis was based on the assumption that
most foods consumed were prepared at home. Indeed the
findings of this study may not hold for those who frequently eat
away from home. The strengths of the present study include its
population-based design, long-term follow-up and the avail-
ability of body weight and validated lifestyle measurements at
baseline and follow-up.
Results of the present study are in line with previous findings
showing that healthy diets are considerably more expensive
than unhealthy diets. Our prospective evidence indicates that a
worsening of overall diet quality and weight development was
related to a decrease in diet cost. This finding is of importance
for health policy because it underlines the need to promote
healthy diets that are accessible for all income levels, with
implications for food pricing, agricultural and consumer subsidy
programmes and tax policies.
