Sexual behavior is essential for the survival of many species. In female rodents, mate
preference and copulatory behavior depend on pheromones and are synchronized with
ovulation to ensure reproductive success. The neural circuits driving this orchestration in the
brain have, however, remained elusive. Here, we demonstrate that neurons controlling
ovulation in the mammalian brain are at the core of a branching neural circuit governing both
mate preference and copulatory behavior. We show that male odors detected in the
vomeronasal organ activate kisspeptin neurons in female mice. Classical kisspeptin/Kiss1R
signaling subsequently triggers olfactory-driven mate preference. In contrast, copulatory
behavior is elicited by kisspeptin neurons in a parallel circuit independent of Kiss1R involving
nitric oxide signaling. Consistent with this, we find that kisspeptin neurons impinge onto nitric
oxide-synthesizing neurons in the ventromedial hypothalamus. Our data establish kisspeptin
neurons as a central regulatory hub orchestrating sexual behavior in the female mouse brain.

emale copulatory behaviors are exquisitely orchestrated by
sex hormones in order to coincide with ovulation and thus
to ensure the highest possible chance of fertilization1.
Female rodents typically control the initiation and timing of
copulatory contacts with males2. This is achieved by a succession
of precopulatory behaviors bringing the female in contact with
males and is driven by sexual motivation and mate preferences.
Once in direct contact with the male, the female will display
receptive behaviors, such as the lordosis posture, which is
necessary for intromission. The neural circuits and the individual
neurons underlying the coordination of sexual motivation and
mate preference with ovulation have, however, remained elusive.
Mice are nocturnal animals and heavily rely on olfactory cues,
such as pheromones, to identify potential mates3. Pheromones
are detected and processed by a highly specialized neural circuit,
the accessory olfactory system, which initiates in the vomeronasal
organ (VNO) in the nasal septum. The vomeronasal pathway
runs in parallel to the main olfactory system originating in the
main olfactory epithelium (MOE). The accessory olfactory system
has been functionally linked to a range of innate behaviors
including reproduction4–8. How exactly pheromones impinge on
both reproductive physiology and behavior has only recently
begun to emerge. Signals triggered by pheromones in the neu-
roepithelium of the VNO are transmitted to gonadotropin-
releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons in the reproductive center of
the neuroendocrine brain9. GnRH neurons are located in the
preoptic area of the anterior hypothalamus and control the
hypothalamus–pituitary gonadal axis by releasing the GnRH
peptide from axon terminals in the median eminence10. GnRH
then acts on gonadotrope cells in the anterior pituitary to trigger
secretion of the gonadotropins; luteinizing hormone (LH) and
follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). LH and FSH in turn regulate
sex hormone production (i.e., estradiol in females and testoster-
one in males) and the maturation of the gametes. In rodents,
pheromones are known to modulate GnRH neuronal activity in a
sex-dependent manner11,12. Exposure to female pheromones
activates GnRH neurons in male mice consequently leading to a
LH/testosterone surge, and vice versa male pheromones induce
LH release in female mice13.
Sex hormones provide gonadal feedback to the brain; however,
GnRH neurons do not express the appropriate steroid hormone
receptors and are thus not direct targets of this feedback reg-
ulation10. Instead, gonadal sex steroid feedback is indirectly
relayed to GnRH neurons. One critical neuronal population
relaying sex steroid feedback to GnRH neurons lies in the
rostral periventricular area of the third ventricle (RP3V) of the
hypothalamus
and
produces
the
neuropeptide
kisspeptin.
Kisspeptin is a potent stimulator of GnRH neuronal activity
(acting via its receptor Kiss1R, also known as GPR54)14,15 and
controls ovulation by driving the LH surge16,17. RP3V kisspeptin
neurons display a profound sexual dimorphism with greater
neuron numbers in female than in male mice18 consistent with a
pivotal role of these cells in female reproduction.
We recently found that the RP3V kisspeptin neuronal
population in female mice is specifically activated by male but not
by female pheromones19, raising the possibility that these neu-
rons serve reproductive functions in addition to providing
estradiol feedback to GnRH neurons. To dissect the functional
role of RP3V kisspeptin neurons in reproduction, we applied a
combination of complementary genetic strategies. We demon-
strate that the RP3V kisspeptin neuronal population is necessary
for the expression of both male-directed mate preference and
lordosis
behavior
using
specific
viral-based
cell
ablation
techniques and optogenetic stimulation. We then analyzed the
neural circuitry downstream of RP3V kisspeptin neurons and
found that mutant mice lacking GnRH secretion in adulthood
also failed to show any male-directed preference. These data
suggest that kisspeptin neurons act through GnRH neurons to
trigger olfactory-driven mate preferences in female mice. In
contrast, lordosis behavior did not depend on GnRH neurons
downstream of RP3V kisspeptin neurons. To dissect the down-
stream neural circuitry-mediating lordosis in female mice, we
then employed a combination of genetic transsynaptic tracing
and viral tract tracing from RP3V kisspeptin neurons. We found
that a subset of neurons in the ventrolateral part of the ven-
tromedial hypothalamus (VMHvl) that express nitric oxide syn-
thase (nNOS) and are communicating with kisspeptin neurons.
Consistent with the idea that nitric oxide (NO) is a key neuro-
transmitter downstream of kisspeptin neurons, female mice
deficient in nNOS showed a strong decrease in lordosis behavior.
Taken together, our results demonstrate that kisspeptin governs
both mate preference and sexual motivation in female mice,
indicating that sexual behavior and ovulation are coordinated by
the same neuropeptide.
Results
Male odors activate RP3V kisspeptin neurons. We previously
found that RP3V kisspeptin neurons are specifically activated by
male odors derived from either urine19 or soiled bedding in
female mice. To determine the olfactory input pathway impinging
onto these cells, we selectively ablated the vomeronasal organ
(VNO) by surgical removal and/or the main olfactory epithelium
(MOE) by intranasal infusion with a zinc sulfate (ZnSO4) solution
in female C57Bl/6J mice (see general remarks on behavioral tests
in “Methods” section and Supplementary Table 1 for details on
hormonal treatments prior to testing). We then tested male odor-
triggered kisspeptin neuron activation in these animals by using
c-Fos as a marker. Removal of the VNO (VNOx), but not ablation
of the MOE (MOEx), completely eliminated the ability of male
odors contained in soiled bedding to activate RP3V kisspeptin
neurons in ovariectomized female mice supplemented with
estradiol and progesterone (OVX+E+P) (VNOi group vs. control
group, P < 0.001; MOEx group vs. control group, P = 0.001;
VNOx group vs. control group, P > 0.99; Dunn’s multiple com-
parison test; Fig. 1a). These results demonstrate that pheromonal
input triggers c-Fos expression in kisspeptin neurons via the
vomeronasal pathway. The number of kisspeptin neurons was not
affected by either VNOx or zinc sulfate treatment.
RP3V kisspeptin neurons trigger mate preferences. Since
pheromonal cues are critical for mate recognition20,21, we next
asked whether the kisspeptin peptide plays a role in olfactory
mate preference. To address this question, we analyzed mice
lacking a functional Kiss1 gene22. Kisspeptin knockout (Kiss−/−;
OVX+E+P) mice failed to show any male-directed preference
(one-sample t test (H0: mean equals 0); P = 0.42; Fig. 1b), whereas
control littermates (OVX+E+P) displayed robust preferences for
the male (one-sample t test (H0: mean equals 0); P < 0.001;
Fig. 1b). A single subcutaneous (sc) injection of kisspeptin (Kp-
10; 0.52 µg kg−1) triggered a male-directed preference in Kiss−/−
(OVX+E+P) females (one-sample t test (H0: mean equals 0); P <
0.001; Fig. 1b). These data implicate the kisspeptin neuropeptide
in olfactory-driven partner preference. Kisspeptin is, however, not
only expressed in the RP3V, but also in neurons located in the
arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus (ARC) in the adult rodent
brain18. To analyze the specific role of the RP3V kisspeptin
neuron population in olfactory mate preference, we ablated these
cells by injecting an adeno-associated virus (AAV) encoding a
Cre recombinase-dependent caspase 323 bilaterally into the RP3V
of mice expressing Cre in kisspeptin neurons (KissIC). Caspase 3
kills the Cre-expressing cells by inducing apoptosis23. Stereotaxic

 viral delivery into the RP3V led to a 71% decrease in kisspeptin-
immunoreactive cells in Cre+ females compared to control Cre−
animals (unpaired t test; P < 0.001; Fig. 1c, d), suggesting efficient
ablation of this neuronal population. In contrast, kisspeptin
immunoreactivity in the ARC was not affected in this experi-
mental paradigm (unpaired t test; P = 0.81, Supplementary Fig. 1).
Strikingly, Cre+ females failed to show any male-directed pre-
ferences after acute ablation of the RP3V kisspeptin neuron
population (one-sample t test (H0: mean equals 0); P = 0.73;
Fig. 1e), whereas a single sc injection of Kp-10 was sufficient to
induce a male-directed preference in these female (OVX+E+P)
mice (one-sample t test (H0: mean equals 0); P = 0.041; Fig. 1e).
Taken together, these data demonstrate that RP3V kisspeptin
neurons could be an essential component of the neural circuits
downstream of the vomeronasal organ
mediating pheromone-
driven mate preference in female mice.
RP3V
kisspeptin
neurons
are
essential
for
lordosis.
Pheromone-triggered mate preference ultimately leads to the
display of copulatory behaviors. We therefore next investigated
the role of the RP3V kisspeptin neurons in lordosis behavior,
which is characterized by an arching of the back and an immobile
posture by the female in response to male mounting. We found
consistent activation of hypothalamic neurons upon mating using
c-Fos immunoreactivity as a marker (Supplementary Fig. 2) in
ovary intact, proestrous female mice. Specifically, ~30% of RP3V
kisspeptin neurons displayed c-Fos immunoreactivity in intact
females (unpaired t test; P = 0.022; Fig. 2a and Supplementary
Fig. 3) following this experimental paradigm. We next asked
whether a single injection with Kp-10 is sufficient to stimulate
lordosis behavior in female mice. We found that a sc Kp-10
injection in OVX+E females robustly stimulated lordosis behavior
(paired t test; P < 0.001; Fig. 2b). Likewise, an intracerebroven-
tricular (icv) injection of Kp-10 (paired t test; P = 0.012; Supple-
mentary Fig. 4) also stimulated lordosis behavior in C57Bl6 (OVX
+E+P) female mice (for details on hormone treatments, see
Supplementary Table 1). Next, we analyzed lordosis behavior in
Kiss−/−
(OVX+E+P)
females
and
observed
strong
deficits
(Mann–Whitney U test; P = 0.029; Fig. 2c), which could be
reversed by a single sc injection of Kp-10 (paired t test; P ≤ 0.01;
Fig. 2d). Consistent with this, acute ablation of ~70% of kis-
speptin neurons by bilateral injection of an AAV encoding a Cre
recombinase-dependent caspase 3 into the RP3V of adult female
(OVX+E+P) KissIC mice also led to profound deficits in lordosis
behavior (unpaired t test; P = 0.006; Fig. 2e), which were rever-
sible upon a single sc Kp-10 injection (paired t test; P = 0.03;
Fig. 2f).
To test whether an activation of RP3V kisspeptin neurons is
sufficient to trigger lordosis behavior, we stereotaxically injected
an AAV encoding a Cre-dependent channelrhodopsin (ChR2)
bilaterally into the RP3V of female KissIC mice (Fig. 2g). Blue

 light photostimulation (1–15 s at 10 Hz) elicited robust firing in
virally transduced kisspeptin neurons with spike fidelity of 99%
(Fig. 2h) in brain slice preparations. Photostimulation of RP3V
kisspeptin neurons in vivo at 10 Hz for <15 s per male mount also
was successful in enhancing lordosis behavior in Cre+ (OVX+E)
female mice (paired t test; P = 0.025; Fig. 2i) without enhancing
lordosis expression in Cre− (OVX+E) female mice injected with
the AAV-ChR2 virus (paired t test; P = 0.72; Fig. 2i). Taken
together, our experiments demonstrate that RP3V kisspeptin
neurons are an integral part of the neural network involved in
both mate preference and lordosis behavior in female mice.
Olfactory control of lordosis behavior. Next, we determined the
individual contribution of the vomeronasal pathway and the main
olfactory system on RP3V kisspeptin neuron activation during
sexual interaction with a male. VNO removal (Dunn’s multiple
comparison test; P = 0.006; Fig. 3a) but not the ablation of the
MOE (Dunn’s multiple comparison test following Kruskal–Wallis
test; P > 0.99; Fig. 3a) disrupted lordosis behavior in C57Bl/6J
(OVX+E+P) females (without affecting the male behavior toward
the female; Dunn’s multiple comparison test; VNOi/ZnSO4 vs.
VNOi/Saline P > 0.99; VNOx/Saline vs. VNOi/Saline P > 0.99;
VNOx/ZnSO4 vs. VNOi/Saline P > 0.99; Supplementary Fig. 5)
indicating that lordosis mainly depends on a functional vomer-
onasal pathway. While ablation of the VNO resulted in a dra-
matic attenuation in lordosis behavior, c-Fos expression in RP3V
kisspeptin neurons remained significant (Dunn’s multiple com-
parison test; P = 0.01 compared to controls). This might reflect
activation through the MOE by specific volatile odors only
secreted by the male when in direct contact with the female, since
ablation of both the VNO and the MOE in mice completely
eliminated
RP3V
kisspeptin
neuron
activation
(Fig.
3b).
Regardless, activation of RP3V kisspeptin neurons exclusively
through the main olfactory system when in direct contact with
the male seems to be insufficient to trigger lordosis. Taken
together, our data reveal that RP3V kisspeptin neurons are an
essential part of a motivational neural pathway that is triggered by
male olfactory cues detected and processed predominantly
through the vomeronsal pathway, ultimately leading to the female
adapting a specific mating posture facilitating intromission.
Mate preference, but not lordosis, is GnRH dependent. RP3V
kisspeptin neurons directly innervate GnRH neurons24,25 and are
implicated in generating the preovulatory LH surge16,17,26–28.

 Kisspeptin can activate GnRH neurons via its canonical receptor
Kiss1R, which is expressed in ∼95% of these cells14,15,29. To test
whether RP3V kisspeptin neurons act on GnRH neurons to drive
olfactory mate preference and lordosis behavior, we used GnRH::
Cre; DicerloxP/loxP females, which are incapable of synthesizing
and secreting GnRH in adulthood30. GnRH::Cre; DicerloxP/loxP
(OVX+E+P) females failed to show male-directed preferences
and actually showed a preference for the female (one-sample t test
(H0: mean equals 0); P = 0.049; Fig. 4a). A single sc injection of
GnRH (0.025 mg kg−1) restored this behavior in these females
supplemented with only estradiol (OVX+E) (one-sample t test
(H0: mean equals 0); P = 0.01; Fig. 4a), whereas an sc injection of
Kp-10 failed to elicit a male-directed preference in female (OVX
+E+P) GnRH::Cre; DicerloxP/loxP mice (one-sample t test (H0:
mean equals 0); P = 0.38; Fig. 4a). We found that lordosis beha-
vior was not affected in (OVX+E+P) GnRH::Cre; DicerloxP/loxP
females (Mann–Whitney U test; P = 0.79; Fig. 4b). These results
suggest that although GnRH neurons are required for mate
preference, they might not be essential for the expression of
lordosis behavior. Consistent with this, GnRH injection into
Kiss−/− females failed to stimulate lordosis behavior in (OVX+E)
mice (paired t test; P = 0.65; Fig. 4c).
Kisspeptin control of lordosis is mediated by nitric oxide. To
identify potential candidate neurons downstream of RP3V kis-
speptin neurons other than GnRH neurons, we used ovary-intact
female KissIC/R26-BIZ mice which express the transsynaptic
tracer barley lectin (BL) exclusively in kisspeptin neurons31.
Because BL is also expressed in ARC kisseptin neurons in these
animals, we injected a Cre-dependent mCherry adeno-associated
virus bilaterally into the RP3V to delineate the projections from
RP3V kisspeptin neurons. We observed a cluster of BL+ cells in
the
ventrolateral
part
of
the
ventromedial
hypothalamus
(VMHvl), a brain area previously implicated in reproductive
behaviors32.
Subsequent
immunohistochemical
analyses
(Fig. 5a–g) showed that a major subpopulation of the BL+ neu-
rons in the VMHvl express neuronal nitric oxide synthase
(nNOS), previously implicated in reproductive behaviors33,34.
Furthermore, our tract tracing suggests that RP3V kisspeptin

 neurons project to the VMHvl and therefore, these VMHvl nNOS
neurons may be downstream of RP3V kisspeptin neurons. We
observed at proestrus that 31.27 ± 6.22% of nNOS neurons in the
VMHvl were BL+, whereas at diestrus 20.25 ± 1.94% contained
the tracer, however this was not found to be statistically
significant

Fig. 5h). Taken together, these data indicate that nNOS neurons
within the VMHvl are part of a neural pathway containing kis-
speptin neurons.
To further dissect the functional role of NO signaling in this
neural circuit important for sexual behavior, we next analyzed
mate preference and lordosis behavior in mice deficient in nNOS.
We found that nNOS knockout (nNOS−/−) (OVX+E+P) females
actually showed a small, albeit significant, preference for the
female (one-sample t test (H0: mean equals 0); P = 0.01; Fig. 6a).
However, a male-directed preference comparable to control
littermates could be induced when injected sc with a cocktail of
the nitric oxide donor SNAP and the guanylate cyclase agonist
BAY 41-2272 (one-sample t test (H0: mean equals 0); P = 0.03;
Fig. 6a). Accordingly, nNOS−/− (OVX+E+P) females also showed
a strong decrease in lordosis behavior compared to control
littermates (Tukey’s multiple comparison test; P = 0.002; Fig. 6b),
which was restored by an sc injection of the cocktail SNAP+BAY
41-2272 (Tukey’s multiple comparison test; P = 0.04; Fig. 6b). By
contrast, an sc injection of either KP-10 into female (OVX+E+P)
mice or GnRH into (OVX+E) mice failed to stimulate lordosis
behavior in nNOS−/− females (Tukey’s multiple comparison test;
respectively P = 0.56; P = 0.19; Fig. 6c). In a final experiment,
Kiss−/− (OVX+E+P) females were injected sc with the cocktail
SNAP+BAY 41-2272 and WT-like levels of lordosis behavior
were observed (paired t test; P = 0.02; Fig. 6d).
Taken together, these data demonstrate that NO is a key
neurotransmitter downstream of kisspeptin neurons mediating
both mate preference and lordosis behavior. The nNOS neuron
population in the VMHvl might be a potential important
downstream relay of RP3V kisspeptin neurons in governing
lordosis behavior but also mate preference consistent with
previous studies35.
Discussion
The kisspeptin peptide is a well-established potent activator of the
hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis. The present study provides
the first evidence that kisspeptin neurons in the RP3V are an
essential part of a motivational neural circuit that is triggered by
male olfactory cues detected and processed predominantly
through the vomeronasal pathway, ultimately leading to the
female adapting the lordosis posture facilitating intromission and
consequently fertilization. Our data establish these cells as a
central hub in the neural network governing the orchestration of
sexual behavior in female mice.
Mate preferences are sexually differentiated: when in breeding
condition, males and females seek out and mate with opposite sex
conspecifics20. Many mammalian species use olfactory cues to
identify potential mates3. It has therefore been postulated that sex
differences in the circuits detecting and processing these olfactory

 cues might provide an entry point into understanding the neural
basis of mate preferences. Indeed, numerous studies (reviewed in
ref. 20) using c-Fos as neuronal marker of activation have
reported important sex differences along both the main and
accessory olfactory pathways when animals are exposed to
olfactory cues. However, how these olfactory stimuli are ulti-
mately integrated in the neuroendocrine brain to trigger the
appropriate behavioral and hormonal responses has not yet been
elucidated.
Intriguingly, GnRH neurons receive direct inputs from both
the main and accessory olfactory pathways, but none of these
inputs were found to differ between the two sexes9. This suggests
that additional neuronal populations must be involved in trans-
ferring chemosensory information to GnRH neurons in female
mice. Our previous observations19 of a sex-specific activation of
the RP3V kisspeptin neuronal population by opposite sex odor
cues suggest that this particular subset of neurons might present
the missing link in how olfactory cues can elicit sexually differ-
entiated behavioral and neuroendocrine responses. The present
experiments now confirm that kisspeptin neurons in the RP3V
indeed present a central hub in transferring olfactory information
perceived through the vomeronasal pathway to the reproductive
center of the neuroendocrine brain leading to sex-specific mate
preferences and mating behaviors.
Kisspeptin acts through its canonical receptor Kiss1R expressed
by ~95% of GnRH neurons to control GnRH neuronal activity
and secretion. Previous studies have provided evidence for a
direct role of GnRH in sexual behavior. Systemic or brain injec-
tions with GnRH can stimulate sexual behavior in both male and
female rodents36–39, suggesting that GnRH neurons are part of
the neural circuits regulating these behaviors. Consistent with
this, it was shown that GnRH neurons have synaptic connections
with subsets of neurons in several brain areas previously impli-
cated in sexual behavior using a mouse model in which the
transneuronal tracer barley lectin was specifically expressed in
GnRH neurons9. These include the medial amygdala and the
posteromedial part of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, both
known to relay pheromone signals, as well as the medial preoptic
area, the ventrolateral part of the ventromedial hypothalamus
(VMHvl) and the ventral part of the premammilary nucleus
(PMV). Using a viral-mediated tract tracing approach, it was
demonstrated that kisspeptin neurons in the RP3V directly
contact GnRH neuron cell bodies and proximal dendrites in the
rostral preoptic area24. It thus seemed reasonable to assume that
kisspeptin’s effects on sexual behavior are mediated through
Kiss1R on GnRH neurons. Intriguingly, GnRH::Cre; DicerloxP/loxP
females showed normal levels of lordosis behavior upon priming
with estradiol and progesterone. These data are consistent with
previous studies in mice harboring a deletion in the GnRH gene
(and therefore fail to synthesize GnRH), which also appear (after
OVX and priming with estradiol and progesterone) to have no
deficits in sexual behavior40.
RP3V kisspeptin neurons, in contrast, seem to act through
GnRH signaling in modulating mate preferences, since mate
preferences were clearly disrupted in GnRH::Cre; DicerloxP/loxP
females. Furthermore, a peripheral injection with GnRH, but not
with Kp-10, restored a male-directed preference in GnRH::Cre;
DicerloxP/loxP females, suggesting that GnRH neurons must be
downstream of kisspeptin neurons in this neural circuit. We
found that lordosis behavior was normal in GnRH::Cre; DicerloxP/
loxP females. This result is in line with a previous study41 showing
normal lordosis behavior in female Kiss1R knockout mice.

 Several studies42,43 have demonstrated that kisspeptin can acti-
vate neuropeptide FF receptors (NPFFR1 and NPFFR2). Herbi-
son and colleagues44 have demonstrated that kisspeptin can
modulate arcuate neuron excitability at least partially via NPFF
receptors independently of Kiss1R. As NPFFR2 and (to a lesser
extent) NPFFR1 have been detected in the VMH of mice45, it is
tempting to speculate that these receptors may play a key role in
the facilitation of lordosis behavior. Future studies using NPFF
receptor mutant mice may provide new evidence of the invol-
vement of these receptors in the kisspeptidergic modulation of
reproductive behavior.
Taken together, our genetic analyses challenge the idea that
GnRH plays a prominent role in lordosis behavior under normal
physiological conditions. There are some caveats that we must
consider however regarding the GnRH::Cre; DicerloxP/loxP mouse
model used in the present studies. Although there is no longer
any GnRH synthesis and secretion in adult GnRH::Cre; DicerloxP/
loxP mice30, these neurons do not die and remain electrically
active and could thus presumably still respond to kisspeptin
through Kiss1R. Nevertheless, the present results suggest that
GnRH neurons rather play a facilitatory than a critical role in
lordosis behavior. Finally, it is quite likely that specialized sub-
populations of kisspeptin neurons exist within the RP3V since
transynaptic tracing has indicated that the majority of kisspeptin
neurons within the RP3V does not communicate with GnRH
neurons46. This suggests that RP3V kisspeptin neurons may have
other functions in the adult female mouse brain that do not
directly involve GnRH neurons and this could well be mediating
olfactory-driven sexual behavior.
We detected BL+ cells in the VMHvl, a brain area necessary for
the expression of lordosis behavior in KissIC/R26-BlZ mice, in
which BL is specifically expressed in kisspeptin neurons31. Fur-
thermore, we identified a major subpopulation of these neurons
as nNOS+. While no significant difference was found between the
percentage of BL+ nNOS neurons at proestrus compared to
metestrus/diestrus, we noticed that the BL+/nNOS+ cluster in the
VMHvl was more clearly detected when females were in proes-
trus. Previous studies have indicated that WGA (which has ~98%
sequence homology with BL) is activity dependent47, however the
half-life of BL within neurons remains unknown. Therefore, it is
unclear whether this genetic model provides sufficient temporal
resolution to accurately detect changes in synaptic activity across
the limited time frame of the estrous cycle.
The trend toward estrous cycle-dependent changes in BL/
nNOS immunoreactivity could, however, be potentially interest-
ing in light of the recent study by Dey and colleagues48 showing
that female mouse vomeronasal sensory neurons (VSN) were
temporarily silenced to a subset of male pheromones during
diestrus, but were fully responsive to the same odors when in
estrus. It was proposed that the silencing of these VSN occurred
under the influence of progesterone, which temporarily rises
during diestrus. In this respect, it is interesting to note that RP3V
kisspeptin neurons also express progestin receptors and thus are
sensitive to the actions of progesterone. Furthermore, progestin
receptors are also present in the lateral part of the VMH and its
expression is highly dependent on estrogens49–52. Finally, a recent
study53 showed that close to 100% of neurons expressing estradiol
receptors in the VMHvl are actually nNOS-expressing neurons.
Taken together, these findings reveal that kisspeptin neurons
communicate with nNOS neurons in the VMHvl, a central hub
driving female sexual behavior. Further specific ablation or sti-
mulation of the VMHvl nNOS population will be necessary to
decipher its precise role in female reproductive behaviors.
Several studies have implicated the neurotransmitter NO in
sexual behavior33,34. The present studies show that nNOS neu-
rons are most likely downstream of kisspeptin and GnRH
neurons since neither GnRH nor Kp-10 was able to induce lor-
dosis behavior in nNOS−/− females. Possibly the nNOS neuron
population in the VMHvl plays an important role because of its
synaptic connection with kisspeptin neurons. However, it cannot
be ruled out that other nNOS neuron populations are also
involved, for instance, in the rostral preoptic area, where nNOS
neurons are part of a neural circuitry mediating ovarian cyclicity
and ovulation54, and in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN), where
nNOS co-localizes with oxytocin. The latter has also been
implicated in sexual behavior in female rodents: mating activates
PVN oxytocin neurons and increases local oxytocin concentra-
tions, in particular following a pace mating paradigm in which
the female controls the mating, thereby linking oxytocin in par-
ticular with sexual motivation55,56. Therefore, further experi-
ments are needed to dissect the precise role of the different nNOS
populations in the brain in controlling reproductive behaviors.
Taken together, our data strongly suggest that RP3V kisspeptin
neurons mediate sexual behavior and that hypothalamic NO
signaling could be an essential mechanism downstream of kis-
speptin neurons in governing sexual behavior.
The discovery that a neuropeptide that governs ovulation is also
able to elicit sexual behavior opens new avenues of research for the
treatment of low sexual desire in women, including hypoactive
sexual desire disorder (HSDD). HSDD represents the most severe
form of low sexual desire. Although the causes of low sexual desire
and HSDD are multi-factorial, there is convincing evidence that
sex hormones play an important role since the prevalence of
HSDD increases after natural or surgically induced menopause57.
At present, there is no good treatment available for low sex drive
including HSDD in women. Testosterone has been used in post-
menopausal women but also has strong adverse effects leading to
virilization. For premenopausal women, there is currently no
treatment available. A recent study from Comninos et al.58 used
functional magnetic resonance imaging to show that kisspeptin
enhances limbic brain activity specifically in response to sexual and
couple-bonding visual stimuli in men. Taken together, therapeutics
targeting kisspeptin signaling in the brain may hold the potential to
provide novel treatment options for low sexual desire.
Methods
Mouse models. Kisspeptin knockout (Kiss−/−)22, Kisspeptin-IRES-Cre (KissIC)26,
GnRH::Cre12; DicerloxP/loxP59, R26-BIZ31, and nNOS knockout (nNOS−/−)54,60
mouse strains have been previously described and validated, and are on different
genetic backgrounds (see Supplementary Table 1). All experiments were performed
on adult (>8 weeks of age) female mice unless otherwise stated.
Animal care and experimental procedures were performed in accordance with
the guidelines established by the institutional animal care and use committee of the
Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Science and by the National Institutes of
Health “Guide for the Care and Use of Research Animals, Eight Edition,” and were
approved by the Ethical Committee for Animal Use of the Universities of Liege
(Belgium), Saarland (Germany) and of Otago (New Zealand). Female mice were
placed into individual cages under a reversed light/dark cycle (12 h:12 h light/dark;
21.00 h lights on and 9.00 lights off) with food and water ad libitum.
Ovariectomy and hormone supplementation. Unless otherwise stated, females
were ovariectomized in adulthood (>8 weeks of age) under general anesthesia after
either subcutaneous (sc) injections of ketamine (80 mg kg−1 per mouse) and
medetomidine (Domitor, Pfizer, 1 mg kg−1 per mouse) or under 5% isoflurane, in
order to control for endogenous hormone concentrations and to prevent preg-
nancies upon repeated testing. At the same time, all females received a 5-mm-long
silastic capsule (inner diameter: 1.57 mm; outer diameter: 2.41 mm) containing
crystalline 17β-estradiol (diluted 1:1 with cholesterol) subcutaneously in the neck.
The dose of E2 (E8875, Sigma) was based on a previous study61 showing that this
treatment leads to estradiol levels similar to mice in estrus. At the end of surgery,
females under ketamine/medetomidine anesthesia received an sc injection of ati-
pamezole (Antisedan, Pfizer, 4 mg kg−1 per mouse) to antagonize medetomidine-
induced effects and accelerate recovery. In order to induce sexual receptivity at the
day of testing, all females received a subcutaneous injection with progesterone (500
µg, P0130, Sigma) 3 h before the onset of the behavioral test, unless stated other-
wise (for overview of all the different hormone treatments, see Supplementary
Table 1).

 Viruses and stereotaxic injections for behavioral testing. The AAV5-flex-
taCasp3-TEVp virus (abbreviated to “AAV-Casp3” (Vector Core, University of
North Carolina)) was stereotaxically injected bilateral into the RP3V in KissIC mice
(total: Cre−: n = 14; Cre+: n = 14). AAV-Casp3 uses the T2A peptide encoding
sequence to ensure bicistronic expression of pro-taCasp3 and TEVp after Cre-
mediated recombination. taCasp3 triggers cell autonomous apoptosis, thereby
minimizing toxicity to adjacent Cre− cells23.
AAV5-EF1a-DIO-hChR2(H134R)-mCherry-WPRE-pA virus (abbreviated to
“AAV-ChR2” (Vector Core, University of North Carolina)) was stereotaxically (see
below) injected bilaterally into the RP3V in KissIC mice (Cre−: n = 8; Cre+: n = 8) to
selectively express the light-activated cation channel channelrhodopsin-2 and
mCherry62 in kisspeptin neurons.
Mice were placed in a motorized stereotaxic frame (Neurostar, Germany) under
5% isoflurane anesthesia. The skull was exposed by a midline scalp incision, and
the stereotaxic frame was aligned at Bregma using visual landmarks. After
alignment of the head of the mice, a drill was placed above the skull at coordinates
(according to the Paxinos Brain Atlas63) corresponding to the rostral
periventricular area of the third ventricle (RP3V; rostrocaudal, 0.2 mm;
mediolateral, ±0.1 mm) and a hole drilled through the skull bone to expose the
brain. A 33-gauge steel needle loaded with virus (AAV-Casp3 or AAV-ChR2) was
slowly inserted through the hole until it penetrated to a depth of 5.8 mm. Virus (1
μl per brain site injected) was delivered at 100 nl min−1 through a Hamilton syringe
using a syringe pump (Harvard Apparatus). The needle was left in place for an
additional 10 min to allow diffusion of the virus before being slowly removed.
Following AAV-Casp3 injection, the hole was filled with dental cement and the
skin was sutured. Following AAV-ChR2 injection, a bilateral cannula (200 µm core
diameter; Doric Lenses) holding optical fibers with 45°-oriented mirror tips was
inserted into the RP3V at a distance of 0.25 mm (mediolateral) from the center of
injection and further fixed to the skull with dental cement. Mice were allowed to
recover on a heating pad and returned to their home cage after waking up. All mice
received an sc injection with Caprofen (5 mg kg−1) for post-operative analgesia.
Viruses and stereotaxic injections for electrophysiology. Adult female
(>2 months old) heterozygous KissIC mice were group-housed under conditions of
controlled temperature (22 ± 2 °C) and lighting (12-h light, 12-h dark cycles) with
ad libitum access to food and water. Mice were anesthetized, placed in a stereotaxic
apparatus, and given simultaneous bilateral 0.5 µl injections of AAV9-EF1-DIO-
hChR2-(H134R)-mCherry-WPRE-hGH (2.2 × 1013 GC ml−1; Penn Vector Core)
into the RP3V (coordinates according to the Paxinos Brain Atlas63), 0.2 mm
anterior to Bregma and 5.8 mm in depth) at a rate of 100 nl min−1. The syringes
were left in situ for 3 min before and 10 min after the injections. Following a
recovery period, mice were bilaterally ovariectomized under anesthesia and, after
>2 weeks, received subcutaneous silastic implants containing 17-β-estradiol (1 µg
per 20 g body weight) according to Bronson64. Implants were made of 17-β-
estradiol dissolved in ethanol and mixed with medical grade adhesive (0.1 mg ml−1
adhesive), which is then injected into 1 mm internal diameter silastic tubing. Six
days later, mice received a subcutaneous injection of estradiol benzoate (1 µg per
20 g body weight) in the morning and were used for electrophysiology the fol-
lowing day
Cannula implantation for ICV kisspeptin administration. Mice were placed in a
motorized stereotaxic frame (Neurostar, Germany) under 5% isoflurane anesthesia.
The skull was exposed by a midline scalp incision, and the stereotaxic frame was
aligned at Bregma using visual landmarks. After alignment of the head of the mice,
a drill was placed above the skull at coordinates corresponding to the lateral
ventricle (lateral+1, anterior–posterior: −0.34; dorsoventral: −2.5) and a hole drilled
through the skull bone to expose the brain. Then, a 26-gauge cannula cut at 2 mm
from pedestal was implanted and fixed to the skull with dental cement. A dummy
was inserted to close the cannula until the behavioral experiment. Mice were
allowed to recover on a heating pad and returned to their home cage after waking
up. All mice received an sc injection with Temsegic (0.05 mg kg−1) for post-
operative analgesia.
Removal of the VNO. One week after ovariectomy, subjects underwent either
bilateral removal of the VNO or sham surgery (VNOx or VNOi groups)65. Briefly,
animals were placed on their back and the lower jaw was gently opened after
general anesthesia. A midline incision was made in the soft palate extending ros-
trally from behind the first palatal ridge to the incisors, and the underlying bone
was exposed by blunt dissection. In VNOi animals, the incision was then closed
with reabsorbable sutures. For VNOx animals, the rostral end of the VNO was
exposed by drilling, the caudal end of the vomer bone was cut, and the VNO was
removed bilaterally with a gentle twisting motion. Bleeding was controlled using a
blunted 18-gauge needle attached to a vacuum. Animals were carefully monitored
after surgery for bleeding and or breathing difficulties.
Ablation of the MOE. Two weeks after the removal of the VNO (VNOx females)
or sham surgery (VNOi females), mice received an intranasal application of 10%
ZnSO4 to lesion the main olfactory epithelium (MOEx) or saline solution (MOEi)
under general anesthesia66.
Kisspeptin treatment. Kisspeptin-10 (Kp-10) was synthesized in Strasbourg,
France (Sequence: Tyr-Asn-Trp-Asn-Ser-Phe-Gly-Leu-Arg-Tyr-NH2, NeoMPS;
weight = 25.7 mg). To determine whether kisspeptin-stimulated female sexual
behavior in wild-type C57BL/6J mice, females received an sc injection of Kp-10 at
the dose of 0.52 µg kg−1 (injection volume 100 µl) 2 h before the lordosis test. Each
animal was used as its own control, i.e., the animal was injected 1 day with Kp-10
and the other day with saline. Females were not injected with progesterone in this
particular experiment. Injections were separated by at least 3 days.
When injected intracerebroventricularly, females were injected with 10.4 ng kg−1
of Kp-10 (injection volume 2 µl), 1 h before the lordosis test through a cannula
inserted into the lateral ventricle.
GnRH treatment. Two hours before mate preference test, female mice received a
single sc injection of GnRH (0.025 mg kg−1, Polypeptide Laboratories France SAS,
SC087).
SNAP treatment. S-nitroso-N-acetyl-DL-Penicillamine (SNAP) (N398-Sigma) is a
NO donor. In order to ascertain the most efficient activity of SNAP (8 mg kg−1)
was combined with the guanylate cyclase agonist BAY-41-2272 (10 mg kg−1; B8810
—Sigma) 1 h before injection. One hour before behavioral tests, female mice
received a single subcutaneous injection (100 µl) of the cocktail SNAP+BAY 41-
2272.
Brain slice preparation for electrophysiology. Mice were killed by cervical dis-
location, decapitated and brains quickly removed. Coronal brain slices (200–250
μm) containing the rostral periventricular area of the third ventricle (RP3V) were
cut with a vibratome (VT1000S; Leica) in an ice-cold solution containing (in mM):
NaCl 87, KCl 2.5, NaHCO3 25, NaH2PO4 1.25, CaCl2 0.5, MgCl2 6, glucose 25, and
sucrose 75. Slices were then incubated at 30 °C for at least 1 h in artificial cere-
brospinal fluid (aCSF; in mM): NaCl 120, KCl 3, NaHCO3 26, NaH2PO4 1, CaCl2
2.5, MgCl2 1.2, and glucose 10. All solutions were equilibrated with 95%O2/5%CO2.
Cell-attached recordings and light stimulation. Slices were placed under an
upright microscope fitted for epifluorescence (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) and con-
stantly perfused (1.5 ml min−1) with warm (~30 °C) aCSF. mCherry-expressing
RP3V neurons were first visualized by brief fluorescence illumination and subse-
quently approached using infrared differential interference contrast optics. Action
potential firing was recorded in voltage clamp mode in the cell-attached loose patch
configuration. Recording electrodes (3–5 MΩ) pulled from borosilicate capillaries
(Warner Instruments, Hamden, CT) with a horizontal puller (Sutter Instruments,
Navato, CA) were filled with aCSF including 10 mM HEPES. Low resistance seals
(10–30 MΩ) were achieved by applying either no suction or the lowest amount of
suction required to detect spikes. For ChR2 activation, blue light was delivered to
the slice through a ×40 immersion objective (0.8 NA, Olympus) via a 470 nm light-
emitting diode (LED, CoolLED) connected to the vertical illumination port of the
microscope. Stimulation consisted of 1–15 s trains of blue light pulses (2 ms
duration; ~0.25 mW) delivered at 10 Hz, repeated ten times every 60 s in each cell.
Electrophysiological signals were recorded using a Multiclamp 700B amplifier
(Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) connected to a Digidata 1440A digitizer
(Molecular Devices). Signals were low-pass filtered at 3 kHz before being digitized
at a rate of 10 kHz and stored on a personal computer. Signal acquisition and
analysis was carried out with pClamp 10 (Molecular Devices). Spikes were detected
using the threshold crossing method. In each cell, spike fidelity was calculated by
dividing the number of light-evoked spikes by the number of blue light stimuli and
expressed as a percentage.
Behavioral tests. All experimental females were brought into behavioral estrus by
ovariectomy (OVX) in adulthood and combined treatment with estradiol (E)
through a silastic capsule and an acute injection (3 h before testing) with proges-
terone (P), unless stated otherwise (for all details on hormone treatments, see
Supplementary Table 1). Females were always tested during the dark phase of the
light/dark cycle. Finally, levels of female sexual behavior displayed by the control
(wild type) females vary as function of the background strain with 129SvJ females
(Kiss+/+) showing relatively low levels compared to C57BL6/j females.
Assessment of the MOE lesion. Anosmia was assessed by submitting females to
the hidden cookie test66. Briefly, female mice were food-deprived overnight. A
small piece of a chocolate chip cookie was buried (~1 cm deep) at a random
location in a clean Plexiglas aquarium (35 cm long × 25 cm high × 19 cm wide)
containing fresh sawdust. The time it took each mouse to find the cookie was
recorded. The test lasted until the mouse had located the cookie or 10 min if the
cookie was not found. All mice treated with ZnSO4 failed to find the hidden cookie
and were thus considered to be anosmic.
Exposure to odors in bedding. Four groups of gonadally intact males (n = 5 each)
were placed in clean cages containing fresh sawdust. Bedding was collected 12 h
later and directly used as olfactory stimulus for the experimental females. Thirty-
six hours before bedding exposure, all experimental females (singly housed) were

 placed on clean sawdust in two separate housing units to separate females, which
were going to be exposed to male bedding or to clean bedding as control (and thus
to prevent the controls from being exposed to male odors). On the day of testing,
females were injected with P (500 µg) to induce behavioral estrus. This hormonal
treatment made the experimental females behaviorally receptive at the time of odor
exposure. Three hours after P injection, 15 g of fresh male-soiled or clean bedding
was placed into the subject’s own cage. Ninety minutes after bedding exposure,
females were perfused with paraformaldehyde and brains were collected.
Mate preference tests. To assess mate preferences shown in response to auditory
and olfactory stimuli, we used a box (60 cm long × 30 cm high × 13 cm wide) that
was divided into three compartments using perforated opaque partitions. The
partitions contained perforated holes at a height of 8 cm to facilitate the diffusion of
odors from the two-side compartments to the middle compartment. Tests were
performed during the dark phase of the light cycle (5 h after lights out). Animals
were habituated to the three compartment box only once on the day before the
behavioral experiments by placing them in the middle compartment for 10 min
(with no stimulus animals placed in the two-side compartments). On the day of
testing, an intact male stimulus and an estrous female stimulus were placed in the
lateral compartments with their own bedding to make the stimuli as odorous as
possible. Three hours after receiving a progesterone injection (500 µg), the female
subject was introduced into the middle compartment, and was observed for 10 min.
The time the subject spent poking her nose through the holes of the partition or
actively sniffing the bottom of the partition in front of the female vs. male stimulus
animal was recorded. A preference score was calculated by dividing the time spent
investigating the male compartment minus the time spent investigating the female
compartment by the total time spent investigating both compartments. A positive
value of the preference score indicates a mate preference directed toward the
stimulus male, whereas a negative value indicates a mate preference directed
toward the stimulus female (for details, see ref. 67).
Lordosis tests without photostimulation. Females were subjected to weekly
lordosis tests in a Plexiglas aquarium (37 cm long × 17 cm high × 21 cm wide). A
sexually experienced male was placed alone in the aquarium and allowed to adapt
for 15 min. Subsequently, 3 h after receiving a subcutaneous progesterone injection
(500 µg, P0130, Sigma) to induce behavioral estrus, the lordosis responses of the
female to the mounts of the stimulus male were recorded. The test lasted until the
female received 10 mounts or 10 min had elapsed. For the first experiment (mat-
ing-induced Fos activation), ovary intact females were paired with males during 30
min. A lordosis quotient (LQ) was calculated by dividing the number of lordosis
responses displayed by the female subjects by the number of mounts received
(x100). Before each experimental condition (drug injection, cell ablation, and
optogenetic stimulation), all females were subjected to at least three lordosis tests
(with progesterone) in order to acquire sufficient sexual experience and thus a
significant LQ. Tests were performed during the dark phase of the light cycle (5 h
after lights out; for details, see ref. 67). For all details on the different hormone
treatments (estradiol vs. estradiol+progesterone), see Supplementary Table 1.
Lordosis tests with photostimulation. Prior to the lordosis test, the cannula was
connected to an optical fiber (Doric Lenses), which in turn was connected to a blue
laser (wavelength = 473 nm) via an optical rotatory join allowing free movements of
the animal. The optic fiber was flexible and long enough to allow the female to
freely behave and interact with the male. After three pretests, KissIC females (Cre−
and Cre+) were then divided in two groups. On test 4, half of the females received
optogenetic stimulation (stimulated), whereas the other half did not (unstimu-
lated). On test 5 (conducted 1 week later), unstimulated females received an
optogenetic stimulation while previously stimulated females did not, thus each
female acted as her own control. Blue light was delivered through the optic cable at
10 Hz as soon as the male approached the female (sniffing and showing mount
attempt). The duration of the stimulation varied as a function of the male, i.e., the
time it took him to mount the female, however this was never longer than 15 s.
Tests were performed over 10 min and the number of mounts was recorded as well
as the number of female lordosis responses. Importantly, in order to observe
possible stimulatory effects of photostimulation on lordosis behavior, females were
not injected with progesterone before the lordosis test, and were thus only on
estradiol treatment (by silastic capsule, previously described).
Transcardial perfusion and OCT embedding for histology. Female mice were
anesthetized and perfused transcardially with saline followed immediately by 4%
ice-cold paraformaldehyde. Brains were removed and postfixed in 4% paraf-
ormaldehyde for 2 h. Brains were then cryoprotected in 30% sucrose68 in PBS and
when sunken, were embedded in Optimal Cutting Temperature compound (OCT,
Tissue-Tek). A glass box was placed in a slurry of ethanol and dry ice. The glass
box was then partially filled with isopentane. The tissue was placed in a plastic
cuvette filled with OCT, placed into the isopentane bath and rapidly frozen. Brains
were subsequently stored at −80 °C prior to sectioning.
Histological assessment of VNO removal. As previously described65, snouts
were removed immediately after perfusion, cleared of all soft tissue, and soaked for
30 min in rapid decalcifier (Apex Engineering Products). Decalcified snouts were
then soaked overnight in 30% sucrose68 at which time a 1:1 mixture of 30% sucrose
and OCT was suctioned into the nasal passages. Snouts were then incubated for 4 h
in the 1:1 solution and were finally frozen in OCT and stored at −80 °C. Snouts
were sectioned at 10 µm thickness on a cryostat. One section every 150 µm was
transferred directly onto Superfrost Plus glass slides and dried overnight. Sections
were rinsed and stained with hemotoxylin and eosin to assess the presence of blood
clots in the nasal sinuses and to determine whether the VNO was completely
removed. A total of 32 mice were used and upon examination, 8 were excluded
because the VNO was not completely removed. No blood clots were detected in
any of the animals.
Immunohistochemical detection of c-Fos or kisspeptin. Brain sections (30 µm
thick) were cut on a Leica CM3050S cryostat. Forebrains were cut coronally from
the rostral telencephalon to the posterior hypothalamus. Sections were saved in
four different series, placed in antifreeze solution, and stored at −20 °C.
Immunostaining was carried out on free-floating sections. All incubations were
carried out at room temperature, and all washes of brain tissue sections were
performed using Tris-buffered saline (TBS 0.05 M) or Tris-buffered saline
containing 0.1% Triton X-100 (TBST). Briefly, sections were rinsed and
endogenous peroxidase activity was quenched by incubating the sections for 30
min with 0.3% hydrogen peroxide. Non-specific-binding sites were then blocked by
incubating sections for 30 min with 5% normal goat serum (NGS) (Dako
Cytomation, Denmark). Sections were then incubated either with a rabbit
polyclonal antibody (1/5000 in TBST-NGS 5%; anti-kisspeptin-10, AB9754,
Chemicon, Millipore) raised against the decapeptide kisspeptin-10 (derived from
the Kiss-1 gene product) for 48 h at 4 °C or with a rabbit polyclonal anti-c-Fos
antibody (1/2000 in TBST-NGS 5%; c-Fos (4): sc-52R, Santa Cruz Inc.) raised
against the N terminus of c-Fos of human origin. Sections were then incubated for
1 h in avidin-biotin complex (1/800, ABC, Vector Laboratory, Burlingam, CA) and
then reacted for 5 min with 3,3′-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (DAB Kit,
Vector Laboratory). Sections were then washed, dried overnight, left in xylene
(Sigma) for 15 min, and coverslipped using Eukit (Fluka, Steinheim, Germany).
Immunohistochemical detection of c-Fos and kisspeptin. To determine the
distribution of c-Fos and kisspeptin double-labeled neurons, ovary intact females in
proestrus (activation of kisspeptin cells following mating) or ovariectomized
females (VNOx/MOEx experiment) were perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde in
0.1 M PBS 90 min after the introduction of the male to the female (onset of
behavioral testing) or 90 min after being placed in the empty testing arena for the
unmated controls. Regarding male bedding exposure (VNOx/MOEx), females were
perfused 90 min after the onset of odor exposure (male or clean bedding). For the
dual immunohistochemistry, sections were first washed in 0.1 M PBS pH 7.4 (PBS),
peroxidase activity was blocked in PBS solution with 0.3% H2O2, and then per-
meabilized in PBS-0.1% Triton X-100 (PBST) and saturated in 5% NGS in PBST.
Immediately after this step, sections were incubated in diluted anti-c-Fos antibody
overnight. On the following day, sections were washed in PBST and incubated in a
goat anti-rabbit biotinylated secondary antibody (Dako, Prod. Ref. B0432, 0.75 µg
ml−1 PBST). Sections were then washed in PBST and incubated in the Vectastain
Elite ABC Kit (Vector, Prod. Ref. PK6100). After development with the DAB
Substrate Kit (Vector, SK-4100), in a black precipitate (3,3′-diaminobenzidine
(DAB) plus Ni2+), sections were washed thoroughly in PBS, and residual perox-
idase activity blocked in PBS solution with 0.3% H2O2. Sections were then per-
meabilized and blocked in 5% NGS-PBST and incubated in anti-kisspeptin-10
antibody for 72 h. Similar secondary antibody and ABC incubation steps were then
performed. The developing reaction used in this step was a DAB brown precipitate,
using the same kit. Following this, sections were mounted in Eukitt after being air-
dried.
Immunohistochemical detection of barley lectin and nNOS. In order to identify
cells that are synaptically connected to kisspeptin neurons, KissIC/R26-BIZ mice
were transcardially perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde at proestrus or metestrus/
diestrus (determined via vaginal cytology). Brains were sectioned at 14 μm and
collected in series of five on SuperFrost Plus slides (Roth) and stored at −80 °C. The
transsynaptic tracer BL was immunohistologically detected using goat anti-wheat
germ agglutinin (1:1000, Vector Laboratories) and has been described previously31.
A Tyramide Signal Amplification Plus Biotin kit was used for signal amplification.
Briefly, slides were washed 3× for 5 min in PBS, incubated in ice-cold methanol
with 0.3% H2O2 for 30 min, washed 3× for 5 min in TNT (0.1 M Tris, 0.15 M NaCl,
0.05% Tween 20), incubated for 10 min in 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS, washed 3×
for 5 min in TNT, blocked with TNB for 30 min, and incubated with anti-wheat
germ agglutinin (1:1000) in TNB overnight at 4 °C in a humidified chamber. The
next morning, slides were brought to RT for 2 h, washed 3× for 5 min in TNT and
incubated with biotinylated anti-goat IgG (1:500) in TNB for 1 h at RT. Slides were
then washed 3× for 5 min in TNT and incubated with streptavidin-conjugated
horseradish peroxidase (1:100) in TNB for 30 min at RT. Slides were then washed
3× for 5 min in TNT and incubated for 10 min in biotin plus amplification reagent
(1:50) in 1× plus amplification diluent at RT. Slides were then washed 3× for 5 min
in TNT followed by incubation in streptavidin-conjugated Cy5 (1:500) in TNB for

 30 min at RT. Slides were then washed 3× for 5 min with TNT. The slides were
incubated overnight at 4 °C followed by 2 h at RT with rabbit anti-nNOS (1:300) in
0.1 M PBS containing 0.5% λ-carrageenan (Sigma) and 0.02% sodium azide. The
sections were then treated with Cy3-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit (1:500) in PBS
containing 0.5% λ-carrageenan (Sigma) and 0.02% sodium azide in PBS for 1 h at
RT. Nuclei were stained with bisbenzimide solution (1:2000 in 0.1 M PBS, 5 min at
RT) and coverslipped with Fluoromount-G (Southern Biotech). Images were taken
using either a Zeiss Axioskop or a Zeiss Axio Scan Z1 epifluorescence microscope.
Immunohistochemical detection of mCherry. To immunohistochemically detect
mCherry, slides were washed 3× for 5 min in PBS, incubated in 0.3% Triton X-100,
5% donkey serum, and 0.02% sodium azide in PBS for 1 h at RT followed by
incubation with anti-ds-red (1:1000, recognizes mCherry) in PBS containing 0.5% λ-
carrageenan (Sigma) and 0.02% sodium azide overnight at 4 °C. The next day slides
were washed 3× for 5 min with PBS containing 0.5% Tween 20 (PBS+Tween),
incubated with Cy3-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit in PBS containing 0.5% λ-
carrageenan (Sigma) and 0.02% sodium azide and washed 3× for 5 min in PBS
+Tween. Nuclei were stained with bisbenzimide solution (1:2000 in 0.1 M PBS, 5 min
at RT) and coverslipped with Fluoromount-G (Southern Biotech). Images were taken
using either a Zeiss Axioskop or a Zeiss Axio Scan Z1 epifluorescence microscope.
Quantification and statistical analysis. Kisspeptin-immunoreactive (-ir) cell
bodies were counted manually and bilaterally in three to four adjacent brain sec-
tions (with an interval of 120 µm between them) delineating the RP3V (ante-
roventral periventricular area+Periventricular preoptic zone) using a Zeiss
Axioskop microscope (×40 objective). Cell counts are expressed as mean number
per section for each experimental condition. Analysis of kisspeptin-ir density in the
ARC was performed as previously described69. To analyze kisspeptin/c-Fos double
labeling, three to four sections were selected from the RP3V and the total number
of kisspeptin and kisspeptin/c-Fos co-labeled cells were counted in order to obtain
the percentage of kisspeptin cells expressing c-Fos immunoreactivity per section.
nNOS-ir and BL+ nNOS-ir cell bodies were counted unilaterally in eight to ten
sections containing the VMHvl (Bregma −1.34 to −1.94 according to ref. 63. Cell
counts are expressed as mean number per section for each experimental condition.
Statistical significance was determined using Bonferroni’s multiple comparison test.
Statistics. Randomization was not used in this study and no statistical methods
were used to predetermine sample size. Investigators were blinded to the group
allocation during experiments or data analysis. Data were analyzed using the
GraphPad Prism 7 software. For all statistical comparisons, we first analyzed the
data distribution with the Shapiro–Wilk test for normality. Preference score data
were analyzed by comparison to hypothesized mean (H0: mean equal 0) using a
non-directional one-sample two-tailed t test (Figs. 1b, e, 4a and 6a)70. For com-
parison of paired samples comparing two groups, statistical analysis was performed
by using a paired-sample two-tailed t test (Figs. 2b, d, f, i, 4c and 6d). Comparison
of unpaired samples comparing two groups was then performed using an
unpaired-sample two-tailed t test (Figs. 1c and 2a, e). For comparison of more than
two groups, an ANOVA test followed by a Tukey's (Figs. 1e and 6b, c) or Bon-
ferroni’s (Fig. 5) two-tailed multiple comparisons test was used. Comparison of
more than two data sets violating the normal distribution, the Kruskal–Wallis
ANOVA two-tailed test followed by a Dunn's multiple comparison two-tailed test
was used (Figs. 1a and 3a, b). Comparison of two data sets violating the normal
distribution, a one-sample Wilcoxon two-tailed test was used (Figs. 2c and 4b).
