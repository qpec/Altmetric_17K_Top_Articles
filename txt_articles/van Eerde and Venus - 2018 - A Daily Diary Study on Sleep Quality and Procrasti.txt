Background: This daily diary study investigates the relation between sleep quality
during the night and its effect on procrastination at work during the next workday.
Previous research has shown that sleep quality is an important variable for work behavior
at the daily level, including employee performance, safety, health, and attitudes, such as
work engagement. Also, sleep quality has been found to be negatively related to next-
day work procrastination. However, these studies did not address trait differences that
may be involved. In other words, they have not investigated whether all employees
experience the effects of sleep quality on procrastination similarly. We explore the
moderating effect of trait self-control.
Methods: Seventy one full-time employees (51% male) working in various industries
participated, including finance or banking (17%), government or education (13%),
construction (7%), health care (7%), sales or marketing (6%), and others. Average
age was 35.20 years (SD = 12.74), and average employment tenure was 13.3 years
(SD = 13.16). Participants completed a one-shot general electronic questionnaire (to
assess trait self-control, using a four-item scale adapted from Tangney et al., 2004).
Subsequently, these employees received two daily electronic questionnaires to assess
sleep quality (measured with one item from the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (Buysse
et al., 1989), and a three-item scale of procrastination (adapted from Tuckman, 1991)
over the course of 10 workdays, resulting in 465 pairs of matched morning-afternoon
measurements (65% response).
Results: Results of multilevel regression analyses showed that sleep quality was
negatively related to work procrastination the next day. Sleep quality, however, also
interacted with trait self-control in impacting work procrastination, such that low sleep
quality affected employees low in trait self-control, but not employees high in trait
self-control.
Conclusion: The findings of this study qualify earlier research showing the relation
between procrastination and sleep quality. We show that the relation is only present
for those who have low trait self-control; employees with high trait self-control tend to
be immune to low sleep quality. Thus, general advice or interventions to improve sleep
quality may be restricted to a selection of employees that are truly affected.

Daily Procrastination
INTRODUCTION
Procrastination is irrational
delay that encompasses the
discrepancy between intention and action: it occurs when people
intend to act but do not act, in spite of knowing that they will
be worse off. Many studies have shown that procrastination has
detrimental consequences in terms of productivity, health, and
well-being (Van Eerde, 2003; Steel, 2007). Not only the delay
itself, but also the guilt and shame over the irrational behavior,
may impact lives. Ultimately, procrastination may even lead to
serious health complaints, depression, and anxiety (Sirois, 2016).
Clearly, understanding what factors contribute to this irrational
behavior is important (Klingsieck, 2013).
While great advances have been made in unraveling the
antecedents and consequences of procrastination (Sirois and
Pychyl, 2016), several limitations can be identified in the
existing body of work on procrastination. First, while we
know relatively much about what predicts procrastination
in the academic domain, the procrastination phenomenon
has
hardly
been
studied
in
the
work
domain.
This
is
rather surprising, given that such self-regulatory behaviors
as meeting deadlines and goal achievement are especially
compromised by procrastination (Van Eerde, 2003), yet are
essential for both individual and organizational performance.
Second, procrastination has been studied mainly as a between-
person phenomenon, with the assumption that individuals are
consistent in their procrastination behavior. However, recent
evidence suggests that there is in fact a great deal of daily
fluctuation in procrastination behavior (Kühnel et al., 2016,
2017a). This raises the question of which daily predictors of
work procrastination are most important. Unfortunately, existing
research cannot provide an answer to this question because it
has primarily focused on chronic individual differences (e.g.,
Pychyl and Flett, 2012), which cannot account for within-person
fluctuations.
Drawing on the self-regulatory perspective of procrastination
(cf. Klingsieck, 2013), which argues that procrastination is a result
of diminished self-regulatory resources (Tice and Baumeister,
1997), we argue that within-person antecedents should be sought
in daily variables that affect changes in self-regulatory resources.
An especially suitable candidate is nightly sleep quality, which
has been shown to impact self-regulatory work behavior through
its influence on self-regulatory resources (cf. Barnes, 2012)
Consistent with this view, recent studies indeed showed that
higher daily sleep quality reduces daily work procrastination
on the subsequent day (Kühnel et al., 2016, 2017a). Building
on this emerging and promising within-person perspective on
work procrastination, we argue that a more fine-grained picture
of what explains fluctuations in daily work procrastination can
be obtained by examining the interplay of within-person sleep
quality and between-person antecedents of work procrastination.
In
keeping
with
the
self-regulatory
perspective
of
procrastination, we posit that one between-person factor
that should play a particularly crucial role in moderating
the relation between nightly sleep quality and next-day work
procrastination is trait self-control, which refers to the difference
between persons in “
the ability to override or change one’
s inner
responses, as well as to interrupt undesired behavioral tendencies
(such as impulses) and refrain from acting on them”(Tangney
et al., 2004, p. 274), Specifically, as trait self-control can be seen
as an employee’
s general ability to self-regulate, we expect that
the negative impact of nightly sleep quality on next-day work
procrastination should be especially pronounced for those low
in trait self-control, that is for those who have poor general
self-regulatory ability For employees high in trait self-control,
this effect should be less pronounced because their ability to
self-regulate is already high in the first place.
The contributions of our study are threefold. Firstly, our study
contributes to the emerging literature that has started to study
procrastination in a work context (e.g., Glazer et al., 2014), a
domain in which procrastination should have great significance
for both employees and employers. Second, by exploring the
dynamic interplay of within-person and static between-person
antecedents, our research extends the emerging literature that
studies behavior as a combination of these perspectives (cf.
Beckmann and Wood, 2017), with a focus on procrastination
specifically (e.g., Kühnel et al., 2016). Third, by exploring whether
individual differences can modify the significant effects of daily
sleep quality on next-day self-regulatory behaviors, we contribute
to the literature dealing with the significant role of sleep quality
in explaining self-regulatory behavior (e.g., Barber et al., 2017), a
research domain which has so far neglected the moderating role
of individual differences (Barnes, 2012).
Procrastination at Work
Procrastination at work has not often been researched (cf. Metin
et al., 2016), in contrast to the many studies on procrastination
among students. However, work behavior, although different
from studying in many respects, also shares some common
characteristics with it. Even though procrastination at work has
not received much attention, it nevertheless can be assumed that
it is an issue of equal, if not higher, prevalence in this domain
in comparison to the academic domain. Work is characterized
by the omnipresence of activities that demand self-regulation
and planning for task completion (cf. Claessens et al., 2010).
Furthermore, there is evidence to suggest that students may carry
over some of their self-regulatory habits from their study period
into their careers (Salmela-Aro et al., 2009).
Procrastination may be seen as avoidance behavior, where
the irrational delay serves to regulate negative mood associated
with task completion. Avoidant behavior used for mood
regulation has been linked to procrastination (Sirois, 2014).
Avoidance behavior at work has received attention in the work-
related literature, labeled as withdrawal or counterproductive
behavior (cf. Van Eerde, 2016). Overall, the literature shows
that avoidance behavior at work is linked to diminished well-
being and lower performance (Lanaj et al., 2012; Marcus et al.,
2016). Procrastination may be considered self-defeating behavior,
and is more closely related to withdrawal behaviors than to
counterproductive behaviors, as these are usually based on
motives against an organization (Marcus et al., 2016). However,
procrastination at work is associated with counterproductive
work behavior, as well as with boredom and lower engagement
(Metin et al., 2016).

Daily Procrastination
Variation of Procrastination Over Time
Another issue that has not received much attention is the process
by which procrastination waxes and wanes over the days. That is,
most studies have compared procrastination between individuals,
assuming that it is a trait. However, a significant proportion
of variance in procrastination can actually be attributed to
fluctuations in procrastination from day to day. For example,
Kühnel et al. (2016) found that more than half of the variance
of procrastination (55%) was within persons. As such, in order
to get a complete understanding of work procrastination, it is
warranted that researchers start to identify the factors that explain
these within-person fluctuations in work procrastination.
The Impact of Sleep Quality on
Self-Regulatory Behavior
One important variable identified as influencing procrastination
is sleep quality, as it may influence the energy of a person
to engage in work, and to sustain effort over time. When
the energy is lacking, procrastination may become more likely.
In general, sleep quality may affect performance, health, and
attitudes at work (Barnes, 2012; Litwiller et al., 2017). Sleep
loss can even become a matter of life and death when bad
sleep quality affects safety, and accidents may occur (Åkerstedt
et al., 2002; Uehli et al., 2014). Sleep plays an important role in
maintaining good health through its replenishing of resources
and the recovery associated with it. Restorative sleep implies
that a person has no or little difficulties in falling asleep, and
no or just a few awakenings during the night. Sleep quality is
specifically important. Sleep quantity or sleep duration during
the night has not been shown to be related to vitality on a
subsequent day (Schmitt et al., 2017), nor to procrastination the
next day (Kühnel et al., 2016). The negative relation between sleep
quality and procrastination has been shown among students and
working adults, in different types of studies, using cross-sectional
measurement (Sirois et al., 2015; longitudinally at three points in
time over 2 months (Glazer et al., 2014) and in daily diary studies
(Kühnel et al., 2016, 2017a).
The importance of sleep has increasingly been recognized
in the field of work psychology (Barnes, 2012). From a self-
regulatory perspective (e.g., Tice and Baumeister, 1997), many of
the issues related to problematic work behavior are related to self-
regulation, where cognitive and emotional resources are needed
to sustain desirable outcomes at work (Diestel et al., 2015). The
impact of bad sleep on work behavior in general is well-described
(Litwiller et al., 2017). Not only concentration may suffer, and as
a result accidents may occur at work (Åkerstedt et al., 2002), but
also work engagement (Kühnel et al., 2017b). Other outcomes
that have been shown to be related to sleep are workplace
deviance (Christian and Ellis, 2011) and job satisfaction (Scott
and Judge, 2006).
Besides having energy available for action, having slept well
may also help in overriding impulses. Sleep is critical to self-
regulation (Barnes, 2012), and self-regulation impairment is
related to poor sleep (e.g., Wagner et al., 2012). Self-regulation
is assumed to be taxing, both cognitively or emotionally.
When sleep quality is compromised, people may feel too tired
to overcome problems in self-regulation, such as resisting
temptations.
Sleep helps to replenish self-regulatory resources; fatigue may
break down the strength needed for self-regulation. Having
self-regulatory resources available should help to overcome
procrastination: more resources are available to concentrate,
persist, and motivate oneself (e.g., Lanaj et al., 2014). That
is, when enough energy is available, giving in to distractions,
unwanted intrusions and spontaneous behaviors that do not
serve the person’
s longer term goals may be resisted, resulting in
better self-regulation. Procrastination means that a person delays
and does not initiate and persist on actions. Having energetic and
self-regulatory resources available will help the person to initiate
action and to remain focused. As such, feeling replenished and
recovered, and having enough energy may be a precondition to
prevent procrastination because of increased resources (Gröpel
and Steel, 2008). Overall, having sufficient energy available may
serve both as a precondition for action and as a strength for
self-regulation to stay on the intended course of action.
Several studies focused on sleep and work outcomes on the
next day, such as engagement at work (Kühnel et al., 2017b);
unethical conduct as assessed by supervisors (Barnes et al., 2011);
vigor (Clinton et al., 2017); and proactive behavior (Schmitt et al.,
2017). As far as we know there are two studies that investigated
the role of sleep on procrastination in a diary study (Kühnel
et al., 2016, 2017a). All studies confirm the important role of sleep
quality during the night for behavior the next day. High sleep
quality increases the availability of limited resources such that
these can be directed at work activities that need self-regulation
rather than avoiding them by procrastination. Consistent with
this theoretical and empirical knowledge, we expect a negative
relation between sleep quality and procrastination.
Hypothesis 1: Within persons, nightly sleep quality will be
negatively related to work procrastination the next day.
So far we discussed and reflected on the power of nightly
sleep quality as a variable in explaining variations in within-
person work behavior, including work procrastination, an
empirical reality that would speak to the importance of focusing
on increasing employee sleep quality. Given the consistently
demonstrated impact daily sleep quality has on self-regulatory
behavior the subsequent day, it may be tempting, at first glance, to
generalize such effects to every employee. The question remains,
however, to what extent the significant impact of sleep quality
on work procrastination holds for every employee. Are some
employees more affected by fluctuations in sleep quality than
others? Framed differently, and perhaps more interestingly, are
there employees who are relatively unaffected by or immune to
the powerful effects of nightly sleep quality on subsequent daily
work procrastination? We are not aware of any studies addressing
this pertinent issue of individual differences in self-regulation
with regard to daily procrastination. Previous studies addressed
time-related issues as person-level moderators of the relation
between sleep quality and daily procrastination, such as social jet
lag (Kühnel et al., 2016) and the match between chronotype and
shiftwork (Kühnel et al., 2017a).

Daily Procrastination
Similarly, in the sleep literature, Barnes (2012) noted that
most of the sleep literature to date has focused on main effects
of sleep on outcomes at work and that only a few studies have
considered the potential of individual differences as moderators
of such effects. Demographic variables such as age and gender
may play a role. For example, Scott and Judge (2006) found
that women were more affected by a poor night of sleep than
were men on outcomes such as fatigue, attention, and joviality.
Barnes suggested the differences should be treated with caution,
and emphasized the need for sound theoretical explanations
for moderation. He maintained that only extraversion and
conscientiousness made sense theoretically as moderators of the
relation between sleep quality and work outcomes. In line with
this reasoning, one study showed that extraverted individuals are
more vulnerable to sleep deprivation for staying alert because
of to their higher need for stimulation (Killgore et al., 2007).
Moreover, Wagner et al. (2012) reasoned that discipline may be
important and found that individuals’
sleep interruption affected
cyberloafing the next day much more for low than for high
conscientious people.
Taken together, research on between-person moderators
of the relation between daily sleep quality and daily work
behavior remains scarce, especially with regard to daily work
procrastination as outcome variable. Moreover, given that self-
regulatory resources play a center role in explaining the relation
between sleep quality and work behavior that involves self-
regulatory behavior (Diestel et al., 2015), we find it remarkable
that between-person moderators related to self-regulation have
not been considered so far. Therefore, answering Barnes’
(2012)
call for more research on both different moderators for different
types of sleep-effects and theoretically sound moderators, we
advance trait self-control as a suitable candidate in this regard.
This variable is specifically focused on such self-regulatory
capacities as resisting temptations and inhibiting unwanted
impulses.
Daily Sleep Quality, Procrastination, and
Trait Self-Control
Self-control is defined as “
the ability to override or change one’
s
inner responses, as well as to interrupt undesired behavioral
tendencies (such as impulses) and refrain from acting on them”
(Tangney et al., 2004, p. 274), and thus can be seen as general
self-regulatory ability. Trait self-control can be referred to as
the differences between persons in this ability. A comprehensive
review of the role of self-control at work is provided by Lian et al.
(2017), showing the relevance in the work context.
Given its relation with self-regulation, trait self-control should
play an important moderating role in the relation between sleep
quality and daily work procrastination. Recall that higher nightly
sleep quality through its impact on self-regulatory resources
should decrease work procrastination the subsequent workday.
Because trait self-control refers to the between-person difference
in the ability to self-regulate, the self-regulatory-enhancing
effects of better sleep quality should be beneficial especially
for employees who have poor self-regulatory abilities, that is,
those who score low on trait self-control (Diestel et al., 2015).
On the other hand, the energy-depleting or increasing effects
of variations in sleep quality should have a weaker impact on
employees high on self-control, because these individuals have
the trait-like ability to self-regulate, which likely functions as
a natural buffer. Put differently, it can be expected that self-
control has a diminishing effect on the relation between sleep
and procrastination, such that the negative relation between sleep
quality on procrastination is less pronounced for those who are
high on self-control.
Hypothesis 2: The within-person relation between nightly sleep
quality and work procrastination the next day will be moderated
by trait self-control, such that this negative relation will be
weaker when trait self-control is high (vs. weak).
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Participants and Procedure
The sample consisted of employees who were recruited
by students working on a research project. These students
approached working adults in their own network, who in turn
were asked to approach other potentially interested working
adults. The research was approved by the Ethics Committee
in the school. A total of 71 participants completed an initial,
one-time questionnaire during the first wave, and then two or
more sets of morning and afternoon surveys during the second
wave, representing a response rate of 81%. Employees consisted
of 51% males, had an average age of 35.20 years (SD = 12.74),
had an average employment tenure of 13.3 years (SD = 13.16),
and worked on average 41.94 h per week (SD = 6.99). The
sample comprised a diverse range of professions within industries
including finance or banking (17%), government or education
(13%), construction (7%), health care (7%), sales or marketing
(6%), and others (e.g., legal, security, and unreported).
Data were collected in two waves. During the first wave we
assessed trait self-control with one survey. One week after the
first wave, morning and afternoon surveys were administered
daily for 10 consecutive workdays during the second wave.
We sent a link to respondents for the online morning survey
around 11 AM and for the afternoon survey around 4 PM
each workday. Nightly sleep quality (of the night before) was
assessed in the morning survey, and daily work procrastination
was assessed on the afternoon survey at the end of the workday.
Individuals did not complete surveys if they were absent from
work, for example due to sick leave. Even though all focal
variables were assessed by the same person, concerns of common
source bias were reduced, because the level-1 (daily) variables
were measured at different times (Podsakoff et al., 2003). This
temporal separation of measurements also increases confidence
in establishing causal precedence between predictor and outcome
(Brewer, 2000).
Ultimately, we obtained a total of 465 of the possible 710
matched morning and afternoon surveys, representing a 65%
response rate at the daily level. Thus, the final sample consisted of
465 matched level-1 (within-person) observations and 71 level-2
(between-person) observations.

Daily Procrastination
Measures
Following the recommendations of Uy et al. (2010) and Beal
(2015), we shortened previously validated scales to encourage
high response rates and lessen participant fatigue. This approach
is commonly used in daily experience sampling studies generally
(e.g., Johnson et al., 2012) and daily experience sampling
studies involving work procrastination specifically (e.g., Kühnel
et al., 2016). Coefficient alphas for the level-1 variable work
procrastination were averaged across the days of data collection.
Trait Self-Control
We measured trait self-control on the one-time survey using
four items (α = 0.76) developed by Tangney et al. (2004) and
successfully adapted by Smit and Barber (2016). The items are: “
I
am good at resisting temptation,”
“
I have a hard time breaking bad
habits (reverse coded),”“
I wish I had more self-discipline (reverse
coded),” and “
people would say I have iron self-discipline.”
Participants responded to these items using a five-point scale
(from 1 = “
Strongly disagree”to 5 = “
Strongly agree”
).
Nightly Sleep Quality
Sleep quality was assessed with a single item adapted from
the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (Buysse et al., 1989). The
item read “
How would you evaluate last night’
s sleep?” and
was rated on a five-point scale (from 1 = “
Very bad” to
5 = “
Very good”
). This approach of assessing sleep quality has
been employed successfully in previous experience sampling
studies (e.g., Sonnentag et al., 2008; Hülsheger et al., 2014; Kühnel
et al., 2016).
Daily Work Procrastination
Work procrastination was measured at the end of the workday
using the three highest loading items (average α = 0.91) from the
procrastination scale developed by Tuckman (1991) and adapted
by others in a work context (e.g., Kühnel et al., 2016). The items
are: “
Today, I was an incurable time waster,”“
Today, I was a time
waster, but I couldn’
t seem to do anything about it,”and “
Today,
I promised myself I would do something and then dragged my
feet.”Participants responded to these items using a five-point
scale (from 1 = “
Completely disagree”to 5 = “
Completely agree”
).
RESULTS
Given the nested structure of our data we conducted multilevel
analyses using the multilevel package in R (Bliese, 2013). Sleep
quality and procrastination are the level-1 variables, and trait
self-control is the level-2 variable. As per recommendations by
Hofmann et al. (2000), the level-1 predictor (sleep quality) was
person-mean centered and the level-2 variable (trait self-control)
was grand-mean centered. By person-mean centering the level-
1 predictor, we ensure that between-person differences cannot
account for any observed covariance between level-1 variables
(Bryk and Raudenbush, 2002).
Justifying the use of multilevel analyses to test our hypotheses,
of the total variance in sleep quality and procrastination 77 and
64% was at the within-person level, respectively. Table 1 provides

the descriptive statistics and the bivariate correlation for the
variables in the study. There are three variables in the study: one
measured at the between-person level (self-control) and two at
the within-person level (sleep quality and procrastination). The
correlations above the diagonal represent the aggregated scores
for sleep quality and procrastination at the between-person level.
Hypothesis 1 predicted that higher sleep quality would
be associated with lower procrastination on the subsequent
workday. Multilevel analysis revealed that this relationship was
statistically significant (γ = −0.14, t = −3.00, p = 0.00), thus
providing support for Hypothesis 1. Hypothesis 2 predicted
that the daily within-person relationship between sleep quality
and procrastination during the subsequent workday would be
moderated by trait self-control, such that the within-person
relationship between sleep quality and procrastination would
be weaker for persons high in trait self-control. Cross-level
moderation analysis revealed that the cross-level moderating
effect of trait self-control was significant (γ = 0.15, t = 2.74,
p = 0.01). Simple slope tests (Aiken and West, 1991) indicated
that the effect of sleep quality on daily procrastination was
negative and significant when trait self-control was low (γ = 0.23,
t = −4.33, p = 0.00), whereas this effect was not significant
when trait self-control was high (γ = −0.02, t = −0.24,
p = 0.81). We conclude that Hypothesis 2 was supported
(see Figure 1). The full model explained 6% of the variance
in daily procrastination. Effect sizes in mixed models are
not as straightforward as in regression models, and there is
no consensus among scholars regarding the most appropriate
measure (Peugh, 2010; Aguinis et al., 2013). One measure that
comes closest to the traditional change in explained variance
in the outcome (� R2 in regression models) is the pseudo R2
in mixed models. In our model, the interaction term explains
an additional 3% of variance in procrastination, an effect that
is common in field studies in this area. In addition to such
a global measure, the coefficients may be interpreted as local
effect sizes. The coefficients are unstandardized. An example of
the interpretation would be for the effect of sleep quality on
procrastination at low levels of self-control: a daily increase in
sleep quality of one-point (on a five-point scale) is associated
with a change in daily work procrastination of 5% on a five-
point scale (or 29.5% in standard deviations, or 38% in terms
of the total variance in daily procrastination). While it is
difficult to interpret what this means in terms of manifest
procrastination, we believe that it represents a meaningful impact
for employees at work. See for a further interpretation of effect

sizes in multilevel models Peugh (2010) and Aguinis et al.
(2013).
Finally, we performed a supplementary analysis to test the
robustness of our findings. Although we showed that sleep quality
as assessed in the morning predicted work procrastination in the
afternoon, a more conservative test involves testing the respective
effect after controlling for previous levels of procrastination,
enabling us to test changes in work procrastination. Thus, we re-
ran a multilevel analysis but this time controlling for both sleep
quality assessed the prior day (i.e., sleep quality of the night that
preceded the prior workday) and work procrastination assessed
the prior day. Such a test enabled us to demonstrate whether a
change in sleep quality predicts a change in work procrastination.
Results, which were based on 344 level-1 observations and 68
level-2 observations, revealed a significant main effect of nightly
sleep quality (γ = −0.13, t = −2.52, p = 0.02). More importantly,
the interaction effect again turned out to be significant (γ = 0.13,
t = 2.06, p = 0.01). The nature of this interaction was identical to
that of the original results described in the previous section. All
in all, these results speak to the robustness of our findings and to
the causal direction of our theorized relationship.
DISCUSSION
As hypothesized and consistent with previous diary studies
(Kühnel et al., 2016, 2017a), we found a relation between
sleep quality and procrastination the next day. Additionally,
we hypothesized and found the moderating effect of trait self-
control. Not only was the relation between sleep quality and
procrastination lower for those with high versus low self-control,
it was even non-significant for respondents high on self-control.
This implies that sleep quality is more important for those low
on self-control, as only for these respondents, it was negatively
related to procrastination the next day.
Our study makes three contributions to the literature. First,
we contribute to the limited number of studies of procrastination
in the work domain, where most studies have been conducted
on academic procrastination. The work domain, however, given
its emphasis on autonomy in reaching deadlines, provides
a relevant setting for studying procrastination from a self-
regulatory perspective. Second, we add to the studies on the
dynamics of daily procrastination by showing that a large part
of the variance (64%) in procrastination is explained at the daily
level, showing that a much larger proportion of the behavior may
be explained by within rather than between person variables. In
other words, procrastination is not consistently high or low over
the days but fluctuates over time. This underscores the relevance
of studying more within-person antecedents of procrastination.
Furthermore, by examining the interplay between within-
person sleep quality and procrastination, and the between-level
moderator self-control, we extend this emerging literature by
showing the effect of individual differences in self-control on the
daily fluctuations in procrastination: the relation is only negative
for those who are low on self-control. For those high on self-
control, there is no relation between daily sleep quality and
procrastination. Apparently, this personality trait helps to curb
procrastination even if sleep quality is low. This demonstrates the
value-added from including between-level moderators into the
equation (see also Kühnel et al., 2016, 2017a), and warrants the
need to adopt a similar model in future research as well. Third, we
add to the literature on the importance of sleep to procrastination
and work behavior. Sleep quality has been shown to affect many
outcomes at work. Some studies have focused on the dynamics
of sleep quality at the daily level, but only a limited number of
studies has investigated sleep quality and daily procrastination.
Our study found that not only the variance in procrastination
at the within-person level was high, indicating the variability
of procrastination over days and the negative relation with
sleep quality of the previous night, but also found a strong
effect of the differences in self-control between persons. Even
though we expected a stronger negative relation between sleep
quality and procrastination for those low on self-control, we
still expected an effect for those high on self-control as well, as
the relation between sleep and procrastination would appear to
apply to everyone. However, the relation between sleep quality
and procrastination the next day was absent for those high on
self-control. The mediating mechanism assumed was that feeling
more rested helps to overcome procrastination. All respondents
may experience the effects of sleep quality, but only for those who
are low on self-control there is a relation with procrastination.
This raises the question which alternative mediating mechanisms
played a role. We will address these below in our suggestions for
future research.
A potential limitation of our study is that it was based on self-
reported variables only. While sleep quality and procrastination
are best assessed by the use of self-reports, the measurement of
variables by means of self-reports is subject to common method
bias (Podsakoff et al., 2003). However, concerns of common
method bias were minimized in several ways. First, we ensured
an interval between the measurement of the focal predictor
and the assessment of the dependent variable, one of the best
methods to minimize common source bias if no other sources
are used (Podsakoff et al., 2003). Second, the level-1 (daily)
predictor sleep quality was mean-centered before data-analysis,
alleviating the possibility that between-person differences in
response tendencies would account for the results – all daily

Third,
common method bias tends to deflate interaction effects
(Siemsen et al., 2010). As our results revealed a significant
interaction
effect,
common
method
cannot
account
for
this result. Altogether, we are confident that the validity
of
our
conclusions
has
not
been
compromised
by
the
use of self-reports. Nevertheless, despite our confidence in
the veracity of the results, we encourage researchers to
test and replicate these findings in different samples and
domains.
Future research directions may be taken at both levels of
analysis. First, the issue of mediators raised above may need
more research attention, in order to investigate the effect of
sleep quality further. At the within-person level, these may
include daily events or states – to elucidate the findings
further. It remains unclear why high self-control employees
remain unaffected by changes in sleep quality. Our assumption
was the ability to self-regulate would equip these individuals
with a buffer to possible resource-depleting effects of poor
sleep quality. This suggests that these individuals would not
experience a depleted state after poor nightly sleep quality.
Even so, we cannot be conclusive about this issue. An
alternative explanation is that these individuals do experience
depleted resources, just like their counterparts low on self-
control, but remain unaffected by it. For example, because
they rely on self-efficacy derived from their perceived self-
regulatory abilities. As such, these individuals may experience
depleted resources, but this does not make them vulnerable to
procrastination because their self-perceived self-regulatory ability
causes them to have confidence in their ability to complete their
goals and tasks. In order to test these ideas, future research
may include self-efficacy or state self-control as within-person
mediators.
Second,
existing
studies
adopting
the
within-person
perspective focus on sleep quality, which makes sense given
its relation to self-regulatory capacity. However, much remains
unknown about the predictors of procrastination at the daily
level. Other predictors than sleep quality may be investigated in
future research to establish the effects within the self-regulation
framework on procrastination, such as failure, frustration,
or other negative emotional events at earlier points in time.
Other predictors may include positive or energizing events,
variables, such as breaks, successes, meditation, and positive
social interactions.
Finally, future research directions at the between-person level
may incorporate other moderators within the self-regulation
framework. Self-control was an obvious candidate in explaining
how people deal with the effects of sleep quality, but other
variables that help to explain how depletion is dealt with
may also be investigated. For example, the Big Five factor
conscientiousness has not been researched as a moderator of
the within-relation between sleep quality and procrastination yet.
Other traits that may be tested as moderators are impulsivity and
neuroticism.
The results have practical implications for procrastination
interventions (cf. Van Eerde and Klingsieck, 2018), in that a more
personalized version of an intervention may be developed the
more is known about which antecedents, both at the daily and
the person level, may affect the occurrence of procrastination.
In general, “
energizing respite” interventions (Steidle et al.,
2017) may help to build energy at work, but their effect on
procrastination has not been researched, nor have daily intervals
been the unit of analysis. With regard to training self-control,
much is unknown; a meta-analysis did not show convincingly
that repeated training of self-control resulted in a higher level of
self-control (Friese et al., 2017).
The results may also have implications for sleep interventions.
Training healthy sleep habits may have more impact on those
low on self-control. Insomnia interventions were shown to lead
to increased self-control (Barnes et al., 2017), suggesting that
state-like features of self-control may be trained using sleep
interventions. Individual differences were not taken into account
in Barnes et al. (2017), but they may be highly relevant with
respect to who to treat and how intensive treatment should be.
Overall, our study finds support for the hypotheses based on
the self-regulation framework of procrastination, incorporating
daily measurements of sleep quality and procrastination. We
show that both sleep quality and procrastination are variable
over the days, and are negatively related, but also that their
relation depends on individual differences in self-control. Our
findings contribute to theory on procrastination and sleep, and
have implications for practice in helping people at work wishing
to curb their procrastination.
