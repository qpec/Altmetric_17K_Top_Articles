The negative impacts of social isolation and loneliness on health are well documented.
However, little is known about their possible biological determinants. In up to 452,302 UK
Biobank study participants, we perform genome-wide association study analyses for lone-
liness and regular participation in social activities. We identify 15 genomic loci (P < 5 × 10−8)
for loneliness, and demonstrate a likely causal association between adiposity and
increased susceptibility to loneliness and depressive symptoms. Further loci were identified
for regular attendance at a sports club or gym (N = 6 loci), pub or social club (N = 13) or
religious group (N = 18). Across these traits there was strong enrichment for genes
expressed in brain regions that control emotional expression and behaviour. We demonstrate
aetiological mechanisms specific to each trait, in addition to identifying loci that are pleio-
tropic across multiple complex traits. Further study of these traits may identify novel mod-
ifiable risk factors associated with social withdrawal and isolation.

 T
he quality and quantity of social interactions are well-
established factors in health and disease, particularly
amongst the elderly1. Around one in four people over the
age of 65 in the UK suffer from loneliness2, a social state strongly
associated with increased all-cause mortality3,4. The magnitude of
this effect is comparable to smoking, and exceeds other well
established mortality risk factors such as obesity and physical
activity5. Whilst a range of socioeconomic, behavioural and
physiological factors have been associated with loneliness4, the
causal nature of these relationships is often unclear. For example,
does the onset of depressive symptoms and cognitive decline
cause withdrawal from social engagement, or is this a con-
sequence of the discrepancy between preferred and experienced
social relations. To address this question, and provide insights
into the potential biological mechanisms that contribute to
loneliness, we identify associated genetic variants in the UK
Biobank study3,6. Several questions related to loneliness and
social isolation were
included in the UK Biobank self-report
questionnaire, and these were recently reported to predict all-
cause mortality3. Under the hypothesis that some forms of social
interaction may have unique biological determinants, we also aim
to identify genetic variants associated with regular participation
in each of three social activities recorded in UK Biobank—sports
club or gym, pub or social club, and religious group. Although
previous studies have identified a heritable component to lone-
liness7, none has been sufficiently powered to identify individual
genetic determinants. Here, we report the identification of ~50
robustly associated genetic variants for loneliness and social
interaction. These data highlight shared genetic architecture
between loneliness and a range of complex traits, including a
causal relationship (based on Mendelian randomisation) between
body size and loneliness/depressive symptoms.
Results and Discussion
Genetic discovery for loneliness. To identify genetic variation
predisposing to loneliness, we performed a GWAS in the UK
Biobank study (max sample N = 452,302) on the self-reported
responses to three related questions ascertaining to perceived
loneliness, frequency of social interactions, and ability to confide
in someone. Results from these three GWAS were then combined
using multi-trait GWAS (MTAG)8 into a single discovery sample,
yielding an effective sample size of 487,647 individuals (see
Methods). Across these data we estimated the heritability of
loneliness to be 4.2% (S.E 0.02) and identified 15 genomic loci at
genome-wide significance (P < 5 × 10−8, Fig. 1 Supplementary
Data 1). A genetic risk score comprised of the 15 lead SNPs
predicted loneliness in an independent set of 7556 individuals (P
= 0.025).

 By integrating gene expression and epigenetic data we sought
to identify the relevant cell/tissue types implicated in the
regulation of loneliness. We observed enrichment of association
signals in regions surrounding genes that are preferentially
expressed in several brain tissues (e.g., cerebellum, basal ganglia,
and cortex; Fig. 2 Supplementary Table 1), in addition to
enrichment for several epigenetic marks also in the basal ganglia,
cortex and foetal brain (Supplementary Data 2). We next used
FUSION9 to identify individual genes implicated by associated
eQTL effects in GTEx brain tissues (Supplementary Data 3).
Across 9178 transcripts in 9 tissue types, we identified 8 gene
transcripts with expression levels putatively linked-to suscept-
ibility to loneliness (GPX1, C1QTNF4, C17orf58, MTCH2, BPTF,
RP11-159N11.4, CRHR1-IT1 and PLEKHM1). BPTF encodes a
transcription regulator that is highly expressed in foetal brain and
is implicated in neurodegenerative diseases. GPX1 and MTCH2
are
implicated
in
multiple
metabolic
pathways,
including
mitochondrial function.
Estimating genetic overlap with other complex traits. Thirty-six
complex traits exhibited significant genetic correlation with
loneliness (Supplementary Data 4), including strong positive
genetic overlap with neuroticism (rg = 0.69, P = 2 × 10−167), and
depressive symptoms (rg = 0.84, P = 5.4 × 10−153), and strong
negative genetic overlap with subjective well-being (rg = −0.72, P
= 1.2 × 10−66) and years of education (rg = −0.33, P = 2.2 × 10
−43). Given the high genetic correlation with depressive symp-
toms, we performed a sensitivity analysis by repeating the GWAS
for loneliness excluding individuals with self-reported depression
(N = 26,801). There was no appreciable change in test statistic
across any of the 15 loci (Supplementary Data 1), median Chi-
square value reduction ~13%), indicating that these loci do not
influence loneliness via susceptibility to depression.
In addition to psychiatric and psychological traits, several
anthropometric outcomes showed positive genetic correlations
with loneliness (e.g., adult body mass index, BMI: rg = 0.17, P =
4.4 × 10−10). We assessed the likely causal direction between BMI
and loneliness by testing a bi-directional Mendelian randomisa-
tion (MR) framework, using genetic instruments and/or datasets
derived independently from UK Biobank where necessary
(Table 1). We found evidence supporting a positive causal effect
of BMI on loneliness (PIVW = 2.3 × 10−6), but not for loneliness on

 BMI (PIVW = 0.58). We repeated these analyses using depressive
symptoms, instead of loneliness, and found evidence supporting a
positive bi-directional causal relationship with BMI (BMI-to-
depressive symptoms: PIVW = 0.017, depressive symptoms-to-
BMI PWM = 9.2 × 10−4). These MR analyses suggest direct causal
links between social well-being and cardio-metabolic health, but
do not preclude the possibility that both traits are causally
downstream of shared biological pathways10. The observed
heterogeneity in these models also suggests that the links between
these traits are complex.
Genetic discovery for engagement in social activities. To further
explore potential biological mechanisms that confer susceptibility
to social interactions, we performed additional GWAS analyses in
the UK Biobank study for three further traits: regular attendance
at a sports club or gym, pub or social club, and religious
group (Fig. 1). The phenotypic overlaps between these traits are
summarised in Supplementary Tables 2 and 3. Heritability esti-
mates for these three traits ranged from 3.4% (sports club or gym)
to 4.6% (religious group), placing them in the bottom 5% of
heritability estimates for other complex traits, similar to other
behavioural traits. We identified 38 genome-wide significant
loci across the 3 traits (Fig. 1, Supplementary Data 5), of which 14
are correlated with previously reported signals for other beha-
vioural/psychiatric traits (Supplementary Data 6). These traits
demonstrated a partly shared genetic architecture–possibly indi-
cating a shared propensity to social interactions (Supplementary
Table 4).
We also observed trait-specific patterns of genetic correlations
with other outcomes, concordant with reported non-genetic
epidemiological correlations (Supplementary Data 4, Fig. 2). This
trait specificity was supported by several of the individual loci
(Supplementary Data 5); the most strongly associated variant for
pub/social club attendance is a missense allele in the gene
encoding alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH1B-rs1229984, Ppub =
4.2 × 10−25), which showed little or no association with sports
club (P = 1.1 × 10−2) or religious group (P = 9.0 × 10−1) atten-
dance. Furthermore, a recently reported signal for risk-taking
propensity11 showed far stronger association with sports/gym
attendance (CADM2-rs7627971, P = 5.8 × 10−10) than pub/social
club
(P = 3.0 × 10−3)
or
religious
group
(P = 3.9 × 10−2)
attendance.
In contrast, several loci demonstrated pleiotropy across a range
of complex traits, notably at the 1p22.2-BARHL2 and 3p21.31-
CAMKV regions. We identified two independent signals (r2 =
0.005,
~230Kb
apart)
near
BARHL2,
the
first
associated
exclusively with pub/social club attendance (rs12759477, Ppub =
2.4 × 10−13, Psport = 0.18, Preligious = 0.14), and the second with all
three social interaction traits (rs699534, Ppub = 0.01, Psport =
1.5 × 10−6, Preligious = 2.1 × 10−10). The latter signal is not
correlated with a known signal for any other complex trait,
whereas the former is partially correlated with reported signals for
educational attainment (r2 = 0.08), chronotype (r2 = 0.27) and
age at first sexual intercourse (r2 = 0.27). Similarly, at the
3p21.31-CAMKV region we identified two independent signals
~200 kb apart (r2 = 0.16). One signal, rs9837520, is associated
primarily with religious group attendance (Preligious = 2.6 × 10−8,
Ppub = 0.38, Psport = 0.03) and is correlated with reported signals
for inflammatory bowel disease (r2 = 1) and educational attain-
ment (r2 = 0.75). The other signal, rs11712056, is associated with
all three social interaction traits (all P < 6.1 × 10−5), and is correlated
with reported signals for educational attainment (r2 = 1), resting
heart rate (r2 = 0.12), HDL cholesterol (r2 = 0.43), blood pressure
(r2 = 0.27), childhood ear infections (r2 = 0.18), age at menarche
(r2 = 0.11) and age at first sex/birth (r2 = 0.35).
Finally, we explored which cell and tissue types were most
relevant to the underlying biological processes regulating these
social traits by performing partitioned LD score regression (see
Methods). Genetic associations for all four traits were enriched
for localisation to genes expressed in the central nervous system
(Pmin = 6 × 10−5, Fig. 2). When considering the 53 individual
tissue types available in GTEx (Supplementary Data 2), significant
(corrected P-value threshold 2.4 × 10−4) enrichments were seen
for pub/social club attendance with the amygdala (brain) (P =
1.7 × 10−4) and for religious group attendance with the frontal
cortex (P = 6.2 × 10−6), and in particular the anterior cingulate
cortex (P = 1.1 × 10−4), which is located in the medial frontal
lobe and is widely reported to regulate emotional self-control and
problem-solving.
A limitation of our analysis was the absence of comparably
sized independent replication studies to replicate associations
with individual loci. This represents a challenge for genetic
studies of complex traits with extremely large discovery
datasets, such as UK Biobank, particularly for traits that are

 uncommonly measured. However, cumulative assessment of
the polygenic risk score for loneliness in an unrelated sample
that demonstrates the overall validity of our study design and
analytical approach.
In summary, our findings highlight the specific genetic basis
for social isolation and social interaction. We find evidence for
shared genetic effects across social traits, in addition to more
specific pathways that drive engagement in particular activities.
Our findings also suggest a causal relationship between cardio-
metabolic health and social isolation/mental health, an observa-
tion which warrants further investigation using other experi-
mental approaches. Future studies should also aim to identify the
potential mediators and modifiers that link mental health traits to
obesity risk, such as eating behaviour, diet and physical activity.
Finally, our findings provide a genetic resource for future studies
to explore potential modifiable risk factors for social isolation.
Methods
Phenotype derivation in the UK Biobank study. The UK Biobank study includes
half a million genotyped and phenotyped study participants and has been described
extensively elsewhere.6. All participants provided informed written consent, the
study was approved by the National Research Ethics Service Committee North
West–Haydock, and all study procedures were performed in accordance with the
World Medical Association Declaration of Helsinki ethical principles for medical
research.
All traits analysed in this manuscript were derived from self-reported answers
to questions directed via assessment centre touchscreen. We used data from three
related questions assessing loneliness and social isolation–(1) 'Do you often feel
lonely?', to which individuals answered 'yes' (recorded as cases) or 'no' (controls),
(2) A composite variable based on the questions 'Including yourself, how many
people are living together in your household?' and ''How often do you visit friends
or family or have them visit you?' (cases were defined as those who lived alone and
who indicated that they either never visited or had no friends or family outside
their household; controls were defined as those who either did not live alone, or
had friends who visited at least once a week) and (3) A variable representing quality
of social interactions 'How often are you able to confide in someone close to you?'
(cases were defined as those who answered 'Never or almost never', controls were
defined as those who answered 'Almost daily'). Engagement in social activities was
ascertained in response to the question 'Which of the following do you attend once
a week or more often? (you can select more than one)' response options were:
'sports club or gym', 'pub or social club', 'religious group', 'adult education class',
and 'other group activity'. Individuals with a positive response to the individual
activity were coded as cases, all others as controls. Self-reported depression was in
response to an interview question ascertaining doctor diagnosed illness.
Genetic analysis in the UK Biobank study. We analysed data from the May 2017
release of imputed genetic data from UK Biobank, a resource extensively described
elsewhere12. Given the reported technical error with non-HRC imputed variants,
we focussed exclusively on the set of ~40 M imputed variants from the HRC
reference panel. In addition to the quality control metrics performed centrally by
UK Biobank, we defined a subset of 'white European' ancestry samples using a K-
means clustering approach applied to the first four principle components calcu-
lated from genome-wide SNP genotypes. Individuals clustered into this group who
self-identified by questionnaire as being of an ancestry other than white European
were excluded. After application of QC criteria, a maximum of 452,302 individuals
were available for analysis with genotype and phenotype data.
Association testing was performed using a linear mixed models implemented in
BOLT-LMM13 to account for cryptic population structure and relatedness. Only
autosomal genetic variants which were common (MAF > 1%), passed QC in all 106
batches and were present on both genotyping arrays were included in the genetic
relationship matrix (GRM). Genotyping chip, age at baseline and genetic sex was
included as a binary covariate in all models. Six GWAS models were run; loneliness
(80,134 cases and 364,890 controls), rarely interacting with others (2426 cases,
286,524 controls), ability to confide (64,505 cases, 238,062 controls), regular
participation in pub/social club (124,047 cases, 328,255 controls), sports club/gym
(135,060 cases, 317,242 controls) and religious group (66,259 cases, 386,043
controls). We used MTAG software8 to combine the three GWAS datasets on
perceived loneliness, living alone and ability to confide. MTAG is a recently
described meta-analytical approach which enables to leverage variant discovery for
a target trait by borrowing statistic power from additional traits. MTAG is run
using summary level GWAS data and can be applied to traits measured on different
scales in overlapping (or the same) samples. Using this approach we increased the
effective sample size of our primary loneliness variable from 445,024 to 487,647
(~10%) individuals. This composite trait was used for discovery, with statistically
independent signals defined using 1 Mb clumping across all imputed variants with
P < 5 × 10−8, an imputation quality score > 0.5 and MAF >1%.
Replication data. Replication data for loneliness was available for an independent
set of 7556 individuals previously reported and publicly available (https://www.
med.unc.edu/pgc/results-and-downloads)7. Briefly, these data were derived from
the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) using a 3-item questionnaire asking ‘How
often do you feel that you lack companionship?' ‘How often do you feel left out?’
and ‘How often do you feel isolated from others?’. A linear measure was derived by
summing the scores from all three questions, which was demonstrated to strongly
correlate with the widely used UCLA loneliness scale. We then used the subsequent
genetic dataset tested on this score in individuals of white European ancestry.
Given the relatively small sample size and lack of individual level data, we esti-
mated a combined allele score using the methods described below (causal infer-
ences section). We accepted a directionally concordant result at P < 0.05 as
evidence for replication.
Causal inferences. Mendelian randomisation is an analytical method to infer the
likely un-confounded causal relationship between an exposure trait and an out-
come. The following models were run, each of which uses exposure/outcome data
independent of discovery where required: (1) Assessing the causal effect of BMI
(genetic risk score (N = 97) derived from GIANT14) on loneliness (composite
MTAG variable from current UK Biobank study) and depressive symptoms (SSGC,
https://www.thessgac.org/data). (2) Assessing the casual effect of loneliness (genetic
risk score (N = 15) from current study) on BMI (GIANT14). (3) Assessing the
casual effect of depressive symptoms (genetic risk score (N = 63) from 23andMe15
on BMI (UK Biobank).
In each case we performed inverse variance weighted, Egger’s and weighted
median methods16. The inverse weighted median method is the most powerful
approach and is appropriate when there is no evidence of heterogeneity amongst
the SNPs, Egger’s is appropriate where there is evidence of directional pleiotropic
effect and the weighted median approaches are prioritised in the presence of non-
directional pleiotropy. We highlight the results from the Egger’s model where there
was significant intercept (taken as evidence of directional pleiotropy), median
weighted where there was significant heterogeneity (as assessed using the Cochran’s
Q statistic); and inverse variance weighted otherwise. A significance threshold of P
= 0.0125 was set on the basis of four independent tests (i.e., = 0.05/4).
Estimation of genetic correlations and heritability. Estimated heritability and
genetic correlations (rg) were calculated between our four discovery traits (defined
above) and over one hundred publicly available complex traits/diseases using the
LD hub resource17,18. We additionally estimated genetic correlations against the
following UK biobank traits: age at first sex, number of sexual partners, alcohol
consumption and objectively derived physical activity/fitness11. Each was selected
on the basis that it represents a well-established (and plausible) epidemiological
correlate with one or more of the social interaction traits.
Gene expression enrichment testing. In order to identify which tissue types were
most relevant to genes involved in social interaction/isolation, we applied LD score
regression19 to specifically expressed genes (LDSC–SEG)20. Significance thresholds
were set to reflect the number of tissues/traits tested. Enrichment testing of Epi-
genome Roadmap annotations was performed using the same framework described
with the above approach. Physiological category enrichment was estimated using
the same technique as previously described19. Individual eQTL analysis was per-
formed using FUSION/TWAS, run using default settings (http://gusevlab.org/
projects/fusion/)9. Only brain tissues from GTEx v6 were used, given the enrich-
ment pattern observed from the LDSC-SEG analysis. A significance threshold of P
= 5.45 × 10−6 was set to correct for 9178 genes tested across the 9 tissue types.
