 Background—New approaches are urgently required to address increasing rates of gonorrhoea 
and the emergence and global spread of antibiotic-resistant Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Whole genome 
sequencing (WGS) can be applied to study transmission and track resistance.
Methods—We performed WGS on 1659 isolates from Brighton, UK, and 217 additional isolates 
from other UK locations. We included WGS data (n=196) from the USA. Estimated mutation 
rates, plus diversity observed within patients across anatomical sites and probable transmission 
pairs, were used to fit a coalescent model to determine the number of single nucleotide 
polymorphisms (SNPs) expected between sequences related by direct/indirect transmission, 
depending on the time between samples.
Findings—We detected extensive local transmission. 281/1061(26%) Brighton cases were 
indistinguishable (0 SNPs) to ≥1 previous case(s), and 786(74%) had evidence of a sampled direct 
or indirect Brighton source. There was evidence of sustained transmission of some lineages. We 
observed multiple related samples across geographic locations. Of 1273 infections in Brighton, 
225(18%) were linked to another case from elsewhere in the UK, and 115(9%) to a case from the 
USA. Four lineages initially identified in Brighton could be linked to 70 USA sequences, 
including 61 from a lineage carrying the mosaic penA XXXIV associated with reduced cefixime 
susceptibility.
Interpretation—We present a WGS-based tool for genomic contact tracing of N. gonorrhoeae 
and demonstrate local, national and international transmission. WGS can be applied across 
geographical boundaries to investigate gonorrhoea transmission and to track antimicrobial 
resistance.

Introduction
Seventy-eight million cases of gonorrhoea occur annually worldwide.1 Increasing 
antimicrobial resistance threatens effective treatment and control.2 In England, 34,958 cases 
occurred in 2014, a 19% increase from 2013.3 National United Kingdom (UK) guidelines 
recommend combined single dose ceftriaxone and azithromycin as first-line treatment.4 
Without available alternatives for empirical treatment, strategies are urgently required to 
address the spread of drug-resistant strains.
In men, incubation periods until symptomatic urethritis are typically 2-5 days, and usually 
<2 weeks.5,6 Prompt treatment usually limits symptomatic infection to <2 weeks.7 
However, infections in women,8 and rectal, pharyngeal,9 and some urethral10 infections in 
men may be asymptomatic, impairing control efforts. In settings where most infections are 
symptomatic and rapidly treated, on-going transmission requires high rates of partner 
change in a sub-population, known as “core transmitters”.11 However, transmission from 
chronically infectious asymptomatic or untreated cases12 is also important,10 including in 
De Silva et al.

 men who have sex with men (MSM), where rectal and pharyngeal carriage predominates:13 
urethral screening alone may miss up to 95% of infections.14
Whole genome sequencing (WGS) allows high precision investigation of pathogen 
transmission epidemiology. Its application to Neisseria gonorrhoeae is complicated by high 
recombination rates, which must be accounted for. WGS has been used to investigate 
azithromycin-resistant gonorrhoea outbreaks,15 and the spread of strains with reduced 
susceptibility to cefixime and azithromycin across the United States (USA)16, and 
Canada17,18. However, these studies selected nationwide samples based on antimicrobial 
susceptibility, and therefore could not quantify the extent of local transmission or what 
proportion of cases originated from other regions or countries.
We sequenced all available N. gonorrhoeae isolates from Brighton, UK, over 4-years, plus 
isolates from other UK locations, combining results with previous USA WGS. We aimed to 
define the expected genetic diversity between samples related by transmission, and to apply 
this to detect local, regional and international transmission.
Methods
Setting, diagnostic testing and samples
Clinical samples were collected from patients attending sexual health services (~25000 
attendances/year, 25% MSM) and primary care in Brighton and Hove, UK (population 
273,400). Asymptomatic sexual health screens included genital and extra-genital sites 
according to sexual history, using nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT). N. gonorrhoeae 
NAAT-positive individuals were recalled for microscopy, culture and susceptibility testing 
(MC&S) before treatment. Symptomatic individuals were sampled and treated the same day 
if microscopy suggested N. gonorrhoeae. NAAT (BD ProbeTec, BD, Franklin Lakes, USA) 
and culture (VCAT selective-agar, Oxoid, Basingstoke, UK) were undertaken at the Royal 
Sussex County Hospital. Cefixime susceptibility testing was undertaken in selected isolates 
by agar incorporation.19 We stored a sweep of colonies from culture-positive selective-agar 
plates between 01 January 2011 and 09 March 2015 inclusive. DNA extracted using a 
commercial kit (QuickGene, Fujifilm, Tokyo, Japan) was sequenced using the Illumina 
HiSeq platform. Sequence data were mapped to a reference genome and variants 
identified20 (see Supplementary Material) and compared using single nucleotide 
polymorphisms (SNPs) obtained from maximum likelihood phylogenetic trees, adjusted for 
the impact of recombination using ClonalFrameML.21 N. gonorrhoeae multi-antigen 
sequence typing (NG-MAST, http://www.ng-mast.net) sequence types (STs) and penA 
genotypes were determined in silico.
Calibration and comparison collections
Calibration samples were used to determine how much variation between sequences was 
compatible with transmission. Sequencing pipeline reproducibility and laboratory culture 
stability were assessed using repeat subculture and sequencing of 115 isolates, 
demonstrating an error rate of 1 false SNP per 58 genomes sequenced (Supplementary 
Materials). The diversity present within a single clinical sample was investigated by 
De Silva et al.

 independent subculture and sequencing of 12-14 randomly-selected bacterial colonies from 
six randomly-selected patient samples (total 76 colony picks). We sequenced all isolates 
from patients infected at multiple anatomical sites to determine within-host variation 
between sites. Samples from 15 contact pairs from a low incidence setting were sequenced 
to assess the distribution of SNPs across highly probable transmission events.22
Additional sequences (Table 1) were obtained from: 94 consecutive samples from London 
Public Health Laboratory, UK (May–August 2013); 222 archived samples from Brighton 
(July 2004–September 2010); 15 samples from Wales, in addition to 30 from 15 contact 
pairs, 45 total (June 2005–August 200622); 78 samples from a ST25 outbreak in north-east 
England (July 2010-May 201323); 196 previously published USA sequences (January 2009–
December 201016).
Analysis
Rates of N. gonorrhoeae mutation were estimated with BEAST24 from time-scaled 
phylogenies. Mutation rates and the diversity observed across anatomical sites and probable 
transmission pairs, were used together to fit a coalescent theory-based model of the number 
of SNPs expected between sequences related by either direct (sampled case to sampled case) 
or indirect (via ≥1 intermediate [unsampled] hosts) transmission (see Supplementary 
Materials). We determined the plausibility of direct/indirect transmission between any pair 
of samples, based on the time between samples, and the 99% prediction interval for the 
expected number of SNPs.
Ethics
Individual patient consent for use of anonymised bacterial isolates was not required. 
Research Ethics Committee (14/LO/0435) approval was obtained to collect anonymised data 
from patients in Brighton.

Results
Samples
Between 01 January 2011 and 09 March 2015, 3512/248627 samples were NAAT-positive 
for N. gonorrhoeae. 1267/21785 cultures were positive. Including multiple colony picks and 
quality control replicates, 1407/1437(98%) isolates were successfully sequenced (Table 1). 
Sequenced isolates were obtained from the urethra 578(41%), rectum 518(37%), pharynx 
239(17%), cervix 68(5%), eye 1(0.1%), not recorded 3(0.2%).
Considering sequences >60 SNPs different from any other as distinct infections (see below), 
1061 infections were identified from 907 patients (839[93%] men, 66[7%] women, 2 no 
gender recorded). Over 4 years, 791(87%) patients had a single infection, 91(10%) had 2

 different infections, either over time or at different body sites, 17(2%) 3 infections, 5(0.6%) 
4 infections, 2(0.2%) 5 infections and 1 patient 7 infections. All multiple infections were in 
men, apart from 1 woman with 2 infections. The median (inter-quartile range) [range] age of 
patients infected was 31 (24-40) [15-76] years, and 1026/1061(97%) of infections were 
identified by hospital or community-based sexual health clinics (Table 2). NG-MAST STs 
were determined in silico for 978/1061 (92%) infections, the most common STs were 2992, 
1407, 26, 292 and 2400. The mean SNPs between isolates within these STs ranged from 
29-496 (Table S1).
Transmission calibration samples
Independent subculture and sequencing of multiple colony picks from single clinical 
samples showed minimal diversity present within patients at the same anatomical site 
(Figure 1A, Supplementary Materials). Variation across anatomical sites in the same patient 
was assessed using 206 pairs of samples obtained within 30 days (203 pairs obtained on the 
same day). 171/206(83%) and 175(85%) pairs were within ≤3 and ≤6 SNPs respectively, 
consistent with within-host variation arising from one infection, 26(13%) were ≥1938 SNPs 
different, had different STs, and varying antimicrobial susceptibilities, consistent with 
multiple infections at different anatomical sites in a significant minority (Figure 1B, Table 
S2, Supplementary Materials).
Samples from 15 patient pairs (11 heterosexual, four MSM) identified through contact 
tracing in a low-incidence setting,22 a median(IQR)[range] 5(1-15)[0-38] days apart, were 
sequenced to assess SNPs across probable transmission events with no alternative likely 
source of infection. 10(67%) pairs were indistinguishable and all were within ≤6 SNPs 
(Figure 1C).
113 Brighton patients were sampled at >1 time point, median(IQR)[range] 423(254-829)
[44-2353] days apart. Only 6(5%) patients were convincingly infected with one strain over 
time, e.g. resulting from re-infection from an untreated partner or delay in re-attending for 
treatment (Figure 1D). As few patients had evidence of chronic infection, rates of N. 
gonorrhoeae mutation were estimated from time-scaled phylogenies as 3.55 (95% credibility 
interval 3.27-3.83) SNPs/genome/year.
To estimate the expected SNPs between direct or indirect transmission pairs, based on the 
time between them, this mutation rate was combined with the estimated within-host diversity 
(determined from diversity across anatomical sites in the same host and the highly probable 
transmission pairs). The resulting Transmission Nomogram (Figure 2), shows the SNP 
range, for any given time interval, expected to contain 99% of all direct or indirect 
transmission pairs, e.g. 0-9 SNPs for samples obtained on the same day, 0-11 SNPs for 
samples 6 months apart, and 0-14 SNPs for samples a year apart.
Diversity in wider population
SNP differences between all pairs of first isolates from Brighton patients between 
2011-2015 are shown in Figure 1E. Assessing the specificity of our Transmission 
Nomogram, the probability of two randomly chosen isolates being compatible with direct/
indirect transmission was 0.95%(5336/562330), and restricting to isolate pairs obtained

 within 1 year: 1.6%(3846/246463), 90 days: 2.6%(1739/67072), and 28 days: 
3.6%(856/23848). Hence, even with a conservative 99% prediction interval and samples 
obtained close in time, high discriminatory power was achieved. In contrast, using NG-
MAST 5.2%(24669/ 477753) of all pairs of isolates shared the same ST; 8.8%(1675/19071) 
restricting to isolates obtained within 28 days. Where the first isolate of a pair was one of the 
five most common STs (42%(410/978) of all samples), the chance of a second isolate within 
28 days sharing the same ST was 16.2%(1330/8204).
Genetic links between cases in Brighton
We detected extensive local transmission between Brighton cases. Comparing 1061 
infections (2011-2015) to all previous sampled Brighton cases (2004 onwards), 281(26%) 
were indistinguishable (0 SNPs) to a previous case, and 786(74%) had evidence of a 
sampled direct/indirect Brighton source using our Transmission Nomogram. Most linked 
cases occurred close in time, suggesting possible direct transmission: of 786 linked cases in 
Brighton, 414(53%) were sampled within 30 days of each other, and 565(72%) within 90 
days (Figure 3). However, 96/786(12%) were genetically related but sampled >1 year apart, 
suggesting indirect transmission or long-term asymptomatic (i.e. untreated) carriage in the 
source or recipient. Despite sampling all culture-positive cases in Brighton over 4 years, 
275/1061(26%) infections lacked a genetically plausible Brighton source. This is not 
explained simply by unsampled sources for earlier cases: restricting to cases from January 
2012 onwards, 205/867(24%), and January 2013 onwards, 142/628(23%), lacked a 
genetically plausible Brighton source.
Brighton cases related by SNP distances and time consistent with transmission were grouped 
into 305 clusters. Inclusion in a cluster required a case to be related to ≥1 other case in the 
cluster, but not necessarily to all cases in the cluster. There was evidence of sustained 
transmission of some lineages. 520/1061(49%) cases belonged to clusters containing ≥10 
patients, the largest clusters including 110, 58, 52, 38, and 32 patients, with ST2992, ST292, 
ST26, ST2400, and ST2992 the dominant genotypes in each cluster respectively. Similar 
numbers of patients, 433(41%), belonged to smaller clusters containing ≤5 cases (Figure 
4A). Sexual orientation data were not available; however, 14/21(67%) of clusters with ≥10 
patients were exclusively male, including 3 of the largest clusters with 110, 52, and 32 
patients.
For clusters with ≥2 patients, the first and last sampled case were median(IQR)[range] 
156(31-486)[1-1425] days apart, and individual cases were 34(9-73)[0-415] days apart. In 
some clusters there was evidence for multiple short-term transmissions; restricting clustering 
to cases diagnosed within 30 days of at least one other case, 122/1061(11%) cases were part 
of clusters with ≥10 cases (Figure 4B). After an initial period of sampling, the number of 
actively circulating lineages (defined as having ≥1 isolate in the last six months) was 
relatively constant (50-70)(Figure S4).
Comparison of samples across geographic locations
Unaccounted sources for Brighton cases probably include asymptomatic and unsampled 
NAAT/microscopy-positive-culture-negative cases. As acquisition outside Brighton is also

 likely, we compared sequences from Brighton at any time with sequences from other UK 
locations and the USA (Figures 3 and 5) We observed multiple links across geographical 
boundaries. Of 1273 Brighton infections (2004-2015), 225(18%) were linked using the 
Transmission Nomogram to another non-Brighton UK case, and 115(9%) to a USA case. 
Combining Brighton and comparison samples, we identified 494 clusters of genetically 
linked cases. Of 60 clusters including ≥1 of 94 cases sampled cross-sectionally in London 
(May-August 2013), 22(37%) included Brighton cases, consistent with extensive exchange 
of infections between these cities 50 miles apart. Sixteen clusters were isolated first in 
Brighton, and six first in London. Of 76 samples from an ST25 outbreak in north-east 
England, the majority, 52(68%), were plausibly part of a single transmission cluster with 
other samples from north-east England; one subsequent case of the same genetic cluster was 
isolated from Brighton.
Of 78 clusters including USA samples, 9(12%) also included Brighton cases. Five clusters 
were identified first in the USA, with 157 subsequent cases in Brighton. Four clusters found 
first in Brighton could be linked to 70 USA isolates, including 61 USA isolates from a 
cluster (cluster 65 in Figure 5, predominantly ST1407, also including 82 Brighton and 4 
London isolates) carrying the mosaic penA XXXIV associated with reduced susceptibility to 
cefixime (minimum inhibitory concentration, MIC, ≥0.25mg/L16). Overall 121 Brighton 
isolates in 34 transmission clusters contained this particular mosaic penA allele. The earliest 
sample from Brighton with the mosaic penA XXXIV allele (in the USA linked cluster) 
dated from August 2007, i.e. 1.3 years before the first sequenced USA sample. We estimated 
the most recent common ancestor of this Brighton/USA cluster with penA XXXIV to be 
earlier: 1997 (95% credibility interval 1994-1999) and restricting to the lineage that 
subsequently dispersed throughout the UK and USA, 2001 (95% credibility interval 1999 – 
2003; see Supplementary Material for details). Cefixime MICs determined as part of local/
national surveillance for a subset of Brighton penA XXXIV carrying strains were 3/38(8%) 
≤0.06mg/L, 29(76%) 0.125mg/L, 6(16%) 0.25mg/L (Table S3).
Discussion
Here we apply WGS to investigate gonorrhoea transmission across multiple geographic 
scales. We present a genomic contact tracing tool, a Transmission Nomogram, for 
determining plausibility of direct or indirect transmission between any two cases. It accounts 
for the genetic differences between cases, but also how this varies with the time between 
cases, providing greater precision than fixed SNP thresholds to determine transmission.
By sequencing consecutive cases in a single city, over 4 years we demonstrate significant 
local transmission; 74% of 1061 infections could be linked by direct/indirect transmission to 
an earlier Brighton case. Most transmission links related to cases sampled in the prior 90 
days (72%), many (53%) within 30 days. WGS had excellent discriminatory power, even 
over short time periods: only 2.6% of randomly chosen pairs of cases occurring within 90 
days were related using our Transmission Nomogram. We show that WGS offers increased 
resolution to determine transmission over NG-MAST.

 Similar numbers of cases belonged to large (≥10 patients) genetic clusters (49%) and small 
(≤5 patients) clusters (41%), the largest cluster containing 110 patients. Many large clusters 
represent on-going transmission of the same lineage over long periods (Figure 5). Sustained 
local transmission may relate to limited numbers of “core transmitters”, but might also 
reflect frequent partner changes involving numerous infected individuals. The most common 
NG-MAST types in Brighton, ST2992 and ST1407, matched those in Europe25; ST1407 is 
associated with reduced susceptibility to cefixime26 and other antimicrobials.25
26% of cases were not linked to any previous case (including the initial case in each of the 
smaller clusters), indicating the existence of unsampled sources of infection. Several 
possible explanations exist. 13% of cases had mixed infections across different body sites, 
i.e. patients could be part of two different transmission chains simultaneously. It is possible 
that not all infected sites were sampled in some patients, missing transmissions where the 
source had a mixed infection. Other explanations include transmission from NAAT/
microscopy-positive-culture-negative cases, patients not presenting despite symptoms, and 
asymptomatic patients.
Transmission from patients outside the immediate geographic area is another important 
source of infections. Although relatively few samples sequenced were from outside 
Brighton, 18% of Brighton infections were linked to another case elsewhere in the UK and 
9% to a USA case. Previous WGS studies16 explored the dispersion of the mosaic penA 
XXXIV, a particular mosaic allele first described in California in 2008.27 Intriguingly we 
find evidence of this allele in Brighton in August 2007, as part of a large cluster of USA and 
UK isolates, with evidence for an earlier common ancestor, suggesting a possible origin 
elsewhere before it spread to the USA. Prior studies16,28 associated this allele with reduced 
susceptibility to cefixime (MIC, ≥0.25mg/L), as originally described in other mosaic penA 
alleles.29 In our dataset presence of the allele was most commonly associated with an MIC 
of 0.125mg/L.
Several potential applications arise from this study. This study clearly shows that efforts to 
control gonorrhoea should be coordinated across regional and national boundaries. WGS 
provides a discriminatory typing scheme, producing exchangeable data, making real-time 
global transmission network tracing potentially tractable. WGS can track the spread of 
specific resistant lineages, rather than the spread of drug-resistant phenotypes as a whole.
WGS detects links between cases not detected by traditional partner notification, e.g. 
between patients with multiple anonymous sexual partners. Genomic links between cases 
may highlight particular risk factors, enabling targeted population-based and individual 
interventions, including notification of contacts, e.g. via mobile phone apps used to facilitate 
encounters.
The short interval between cases in some clusters suggests a need for more frequent 
screening in high risk populations. Current UK guidelines30 recommend 3-monthly testing 
for MSM at high risk, but we observed many transmission links occurred in <30 days. The 
number of cases without an identified source also raises questions about the proportion of 
high risk patients participating in screening for asymptomatic carriage.

 Given its retrospective and laboratory based nature, this study has limitations. Our 
Transmission Nomogram cannot distinguish between direct case-to-case and indirect 
transmission, even where two cases have zero SNPs between them transmission via ≥1 
intermediate host is still possible. Therefore, the prevalence of each genetic subtype, the 
time between cases, and available contact data need to be used with the Nomogram to 
determine the likelihood of direct, as opposed to indirect, transmission. We lack data on 
patient symptomatology and lack complete epidemiological contact data. Sample 
comparisons from outside of Brighton opportunistically use sequences obtained for other 
reasons, and do not systematically assess regional or international transmission. However, 
national antimicrobial susceptibility surveillance samples could be used for this purpose. 
Routine use of pathogen WGS in sexual health raises potential ethical issues. For example, 
WGS may allow linkage of cases without explicit consent for contact tracing. However, in 
existing contact tracing those notified have not explicitly consented to be approached either; 
and WGS is essentially an additional tool in the armamentarium of techniques available to 
those conducting contact tracing. The handling of WGS datasets, in particular those with 
patient identifiable information, must be robust to maintain patient confidentiality.
We have shown genomic contact tracing for gonorrhoea is possible. We provide a 
Transmission Nomogram to enable other investigators and health professionals to apply its 
use. WGS provides a powerful tool to guide interventions to stop the spread of drug-resistant 
N. gonorrhoeae.

 Research in Context
Evidence before this study
We searched PubMed for publications up until 15 March 2016 with the terms ((Neisseria 
gonorrhoeae) OR Gonorrhoea) AND (sequencing OR (molecular epidemiology)), 
references and subsequent citations (identified using Google Scholar) were also reviewed.
Previous studies have used whole genome sequencing (WGS) of Neisseria gonorrhoeae 
to investigate the spread of drug resistant strains at a national level in the USA and 
Canada, and used WGS to investigate relatively small local outbreaks.
No study to date has systematically applied WGS to quantify the extent of local 
transmission and what proportion of cases might have originated from other regions or 
countries.
Added value of this study
We present a tool for genomic contact tracing of N. gonorrhoeae: based on multiple 
sampling frames, we derive a Transmission Nomogram that can be used to determine if 
direct or indirect transmission between any two cases is plausible using genetic data and 
the time between the cases being diagnosed.
From sequencing all culture-positive N. gonorrhoeae infections from a single city, 
Brighton, UK, over a 4 year period, we demonstrate extensive local transmission, with 
sustained transmission of some lineages, and related cases typically occurring a few days 
or weeks apart. However, a quarter of cases could not be linked to a local direct/indirect 
source.
We observed multiple related samples across geographic locations, linking samples from 
Brighton to other UK locations and to cases from the USA, including to a lineage 
carrying the mosaic penA XXXIV associated with reduced cefixime susceptibility.
We show that 13% of cases have distinct strains at different anatomical sites, i.e. that 
these patients simultaneously belong to multiple transmission networks.
Implications of all the available evidence
Genomic contact tracing has the potential to inform control of gonorrhoea transmission at 
a local, national and international level.
Improved local control may depend on more regular screening and treatment of high risk 
individuals.
Genomic led contact tracing has significant potential amongst patients with multiple 
anonymous sexual partners, where traditional partner notification is very difficult.
WGS provides a discriminatory typing scheme, producing readily exchangeable data, 
making global contact tracing and tracking of specific resistant lineages possible.

 Figure 1. Transmission calibration sampling frames.
Panel A shows the genetic variation within six randomly chosen clinical samples, 12-14 
colonies were sequenced independently. Within each clinical sample sequences from the first 
colony chosen were compared to all other colonies sequenced. On the right-hand side, each 
colour represents a different clinical sample. The area of the circles is proportional to the 
number of colonies with identical genome sequences. Lines between circles represent the 
numbers of SNPs between colonies. In 5 samples all sequences were identical, shown as a 
single circle. Panel B shows the diversity present across different anatomical sites in the

pairs. Panel D shows the variation in the same patient over time. Panel E shows the diversity 
between different patients in Brighton. All first samples from each infection in each patient 
were compared pairwise.

 Figure 2. Transmission Nomogram.
SNPs expected between direct or indirect transmission pairs for varying time between 
samples are shaded (99% prediction interval). The dotted line shows the mean number of 
SNPs. The upper panel shows expected numbers of SNPs over the longest interval possible 
between samples in the study. Of 1061 distinct infections, only 2 (0.2%) had a potential 
source with lower than the expected number of SNPs, 0 SNPs after 466 days, and 1 SNP 
after 686 days. The lower panel shows the expected number of SNPs over a time between 
samples of up to 1 year.

 Figure 3. Percentage of Brighton infections genetically linked to a previous sampled case by 
maximum time between cases.
Brighton vs. Brighton compares cases in Brighton (2011-2015) to all previous Brighton 
cases (2004 onwards). To avoid double counting of cases, cases were only compared to 
previous cases, accepting sampling dates may not indicate the direction of transmission. In 
the Brighton vs. UK and Brighton vs. USA plots all cases from Brighton (2004-2015) were 
compared to all cases from the rest of the UK or USA respectively, independent of the order 
of sampling.

 Figure 4. Brighton clusters of genetically linked cases.
Cases within Brighton were clustered based on those related by SNP distances and time 
compatible with transmission. Panel A shows clusters for 1061 cases between January 2011 
and March 2015. Panel B restricts clustering to where sampling of consecutive cases within 
a cluster occurred within 30 days.

 Figure 5. Genetic clusters within Brighton, UK and USA.
Each genetic cluster contains all cases related by a number of SNPs and time compatible 
with transmission. Each genetic cluster is plotted on its own horizontal line, with individual 
cases indicated as dots. For ease of visualisation, clusters arising from January 2011 are 
shown separately on the right-hand side. Samples obtained in Brighton in 2004 and 2005 
were collected within a 2-month interval, but the exact collection dates were not available. 
These samples have been randomly distributed throughout the 2 months of sampling. 
Similarly, only the month and year of collection was known for the USA samples, and a 
random day has been assigned.
