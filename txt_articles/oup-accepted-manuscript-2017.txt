Abstract
Background: Although colorectal adenomas serve as prime target for colorectal cancer (CRC) surveillance in other high-risk
groups, data on adenoma risk after childhood cancer are lacking. We evaluated the risk of histologically confirmed colorectal
adenomas among childhood cancer survivors. A secondary aim was to assess CRC risk.
Methods: The DCOG-LATER cohort study includes five-year Dutch childhood cancer survivors and a sibling comparison group
(n ¼ 883). Colorectal tumors were identified from the population-based Dutch Pathology Registry (PALGA). We calculated cu-
mulative incidences of adenomas/CRCs for survivors and siblings. For adenomas, multivariable Cox regression models were
used to evaluate potential risk factors. All statistical tests were two-sided.
Results: Among 5843 five-year survivors (median follow-up ¼ 24.9 years), 78 individuals developed an adenoma. Cumulative
incidence by age 45 years was 3.6% (95% confidence interval [CI] ¼ 2.2% to 5.6%) after abdominopelvic radiotherapy (AP-RT;
49 cases) vs 2.0% (95% CI ¼ 1.3% to 2.8%) among survivors without AP-RT (28 cases; Pdifference ¼ .07) and vs 1.0% (95% CI ¼ 0.3%
to 2.6%) among siblings (6 cases) (Pdifference ¼ .03). Factors associated with adenoma risk were AP-RT (hazard ratio [HR] ¼ 2.12,
95% CI ¼ 1.24 to 3.60), total body irradiation (TBI; HR ¼ 10.55, 95% CI ¼ 5.20 to 21.42), cisplatin (HR ¼ 2.13; 95% CI ¼ 0.74 to 6.07
for <480 mg/m2; HR ¼ 3.85, 95% CI ¼ 1.45 to 10.26 for �480 mg/m2; Ptrend ¼ .62), a hepatoblastoma diagnosis (HR ¼ 27.12,

 95% CI ¼ 8.80 to 83.58), and family history of early-onset CRC (HR ¼ 20.46, 95% CI ¼ 8.10 to 51.70). Procarbazine was statistically
significantly associated among survivors without AP-RT/TBI (HR ¼ 2.71, 95% CI ¼ 1.28 to 5.74). Thirteen CRCs occurred.
Conclusion: We provide evidence for excess risk of colorectal adenomas and CRCs among childhood cancer survivors.
Adenoma risk factors include AP-RT, TBI, cisplatin, and procarbazine. Hepatoblastoma (familial adenomatous polyposis-
associated) and family history of early-onset CRC were confirmed as strong risk factors. A full benefit-vs-harm evaluation of
CRC screening among high-risk childhood cancer survivors warrants consideration.
In recent years, evidence has mounted for an elevated incidence
of colorectal cancer (CRC) among (young) adults who received
high-dose abdominal radiotherapy decades earlier and, per-
haps, also among those who received alkylating agent–based
chemotherapy (1–4). These findings have spurred debate on the
need for early detection programs among childhood cancer sur-
vivors (1–4) to find CRC precursors, that is, adenoma or early-
stage CRC amenable to curative treatment (5–7). A recent study
of early colonoscopic screening (age 35–49 years) among 54
childhood cancer survivors treated with high-dose abdominal
radiotherapy revealed an adenomatous polyp prevalence com-
parable with that among the average-risk population age 50
years or older (8). To our knowledge, there have been no pub-
lished data on the risk of and treatment-related risk factors for
colorectal adenomas among childhood cancer survivors not in-
volved in colorectal tumor surveillance programs.
In the general population and among individuals with can-
cer susceptibility syndromes, most CRCs are preceded by adeno-
mas (9,10). Timely removal of adenomas reduces CRC incidence
and mortality (11,12), providing the rationale for CRC screening
in these settings (5–7).
We aimed to determine the risk of histologically confirmed
colorectal adenomas and cancers in a large cohort of five-year
childhood cancer survivors not subject to systematic colorectal
tumor screening and a sibling comparison group. Moreover, we
quantified contributions of abdominopelvic radiotherapy, spe-
cific chemotherapeutic agents, and indicators of colorectal tu-
mor predisposition in the etiology of adenomas.
Methods
Study Cohort
The DCOG-LATER cohort includes five-year survivors of child-
hood cancer originally diagnosed between January 1, 1963, and
December 31, 2001, younger than age 18 years in one of seven
Dutch pediatric oncology and stem cell transplant centers, as
reported previously (13). The study protocol was declared ex-
empt from review of medical intervention research by institu-
tional review boards of all participating centers.
Information on Diagnosis, Treatment, and Family
History of Colorectal Cancer
Details on prior cancer diagnosis and treatment for primary tu-
mor and any recurrences were collected from original medical
files (13). Here, we further specified abdominopelvic radiation
exposure by estimating the colorectal tract volume directly ex-
posed to radiation. A pediatric radiation oncologist (WD) and a
radiation technologist (JK) determined the estimated proportion
of total colorectal volume exposed based on the childhood
cancer-specific coded treatment fields. Also, anatomy/position
information of the colorectum was used, based on specific expe-
rience,
anatomy
text
books,
and
a
sample
of
available
radiotherapy simulation films from fields involving the abdo-
men (Supplementary Table 1, available online). Discrepancies
were discussed (JCT) until consensus was achieved. Total body
irradiation (TBI) was evaluated separately. Information on fam-
ily history of early-onset CRC (CRC before age 50 years in first-
degree relatives) was collected in the 2013–2014 DCOG-LATER
questionnaire survey and from medical records.
Vital Status and Colorectal Tumor Outcome
Ascertainment
Vital status and emigration status for all survivors were
obtained from the Municipal Person Records Database, linkage
to the Central Office of Genealogy, or from the last known mu-
nicipality of residence (13). Colorectal tumors were identified by
linkage with the nationwide network and registry of histo- and
cytopathology in the Netherlands (PALGA), which was estab-
lished in 1970 and which attained full nationwide coverage in
1990 (14). Linkage was based on family name, sex, and birth
date. We included all pathology excerpts with PALGA codes for
colorectal adenomas and cancers (detailed in Supplementary
Table 2, available online) in the period January 1, 1990, to
January 9, 2017. For all adenomas, we sought medical file review
in the DCOG-LATER academic centers to retrieve the indication
for colonoscopy, coded as follows: 1) specific colorectal tumor–
related symptoms; 2) screening or surveillance colonoscopy
because of a (possible) genetic predisposition for developing co-
lorectal tumors; 3) screening or surveillance colonoscopy for
other reasons; 4) accidental finding on imaging/colonoscopy for
reasons other than a suspected colorectal tumor.
Eligible Study Population Survivors and Siblings
From the DCOG-LATER cohort (6165 five-year survivors), we
excluded individuals who opposed use of health care data (n
¼ 152) and those who died, emigrated, or were lost to follow-
up prior to 1990 (n ¼ 170) (Figure S1). Survivors who partici-
pated in the 2013–2014 questionnaire survey (n ¼ 3172) were
asked to invite their respective siblings. In total, 883 of 1663
(53%) approached siblings were eligible for this study, and co-
lorectal adenomas and cancers were ascertained as described
above.
Statistical Analyses
Time at risk started five years after childhood cancer diagnosis
or January 1, 1990 (date full nationwide coverage PALGA),
whichever came last, and ended at the date of diagnosis of the
first adenoma, date of death, date of emigration, date of loss to
follow-up, or end of study (January 9, 2017), whichever came
first. To describe heterogeneity in the cohort, the distribution of
person-years and the crude adenoma rate/10 000 person-years
were graphically depicted by childhood cancer type, stratified
by age or by radiotherapy to the colorectal area (abdominopelvic

 radiotherapy/TBI). Cumulative incidence of histologically con-
firmed adenomas was estimated, treating death as a competing
risk. Cumulative incidences were compared between (sub-
groups of) survivors and siblings with pairwise Pepe-Mori tests
(15). Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were used
to examine the effect of potential risk factors on subsequent ad-
enoma risk (as detailed in the Supplementary Methods and
Supplementary Table 3, available online). We chose attained
age as the time scale to take into account expected variation in
colon adenoma risk with increasing age (16). Although the main
focus was on treatment factors, we added indicator variables
for hepatoblastoma and medulloblastoma to the final model to
ascertain the anticipated influence of genetic susceptibility to
colorectal tumors because these childhood tumors cluster
among individuals affected by familial adenomatous polyposis
(FAP) (17). We evaluated the proportional hazards assumption
by visual inspection of log-minus-log survival curves and
Schoenfeld residuals vs attained age. We calculated standard-
ized incidence ratios (SIRs) and excess absolute risks per 10 000
person-years of follow-up (EARs) for CRC. Expected numbers
were based on age-, sex-, and calendar year–specific rates from
the Netherlands Cancer Registry (13,18). All analyses were per-
formed using Stata, version 13 (Stata Statistical Software,
Release 13, StataCorp., College Station, TX). All statistical tests
were two-sided. For all analyses, a P value of less than .05 was
considered statistically significant.
Results
Cohort Characteristics
This analysis included 5843 five-year survivors (97.4% with
complete follow-up during 1990–2017) who contributed 112 157
person-years at risk. The median time since childhood cancer
diagnosis was 24.9 years (range ¼ 5.0–53.9 years), and the me-
dian attained age at end of follow-up was 32.4 years (range ¼
5.8–69.2 years) for survivors and 32.2 years (range ¼ 11.4–73.3
years) for siblings. In total, 78 (1.3%) survivors developed at least
one adenoma compared with six of 883 (0.7%) siblings (Table 1).
Survivors with adenoma had a higher attained age at end of
follow-up than the cohort as a whole. More than half of the sur-
vivors with an adenoma developed multiple adenomas, and six
patients (7.7%) developed more than 10 adenomas. Compared
with the eligible cohort, patients with adenoma were seemingly
more often diagnosed with childhood cancer prior to 1980 and
were more likely to have received radiotherapy to the colorectal
area, procarbazine, and cisplatin (Table 2).

 Cohort Distribution of Age and Abdominopelvic
Radiotherapy/TBI
The adenoma rate appeared to be highest among individuals
age 40 years or older (red bars in Supplementary Figure 2A,
available online). In all, survivors of renal tumors seemed to be
the most likely to have received abdominopelvic radiotherapy/
TBI (40.4%, gray bars in Supplementary Figure 2B, available on-
line). Moreover, survivors with abdominopelvic radiotherapy/
TBI appeared to have higher adenoma rates than survivors
without such treatments, in particular following leukemia, re-
nal tumors, and sarcoma (red bars in Supplementary Figure 2B,
available online).
Cumulative Incidence Colorectal Adenoma
The cumulative incidence of histologically confirmed adenomas
by age 45 years was 3.6% (95% confidence interval [CI] ¼ 2.2% to
5.6%) for survivors who had radiotherapy to the colorectal area
(including TBI), 2.0% (95% CI ¼ 1.3% to 2.8%) for those without
such treatments, and 1.0% (95% CI ¼ 0.3% to 2.6%) for siblings
(Figure 1). Among survivors with radiotherapy to the colorectal
area, the cumulative incidence of adenomas by age 45 years
was statistically significantly higher than among siblings

 (P ¼ .03), and higher than among survivors without radiother-
apy to the colorectal area, though this difference was not sta-
tistically significant (P ¼ .07).
Multivariable Cox Regression Analyses Colorectal
Adenoma
We then performed multivariable Cox regression analyses to
evaluate the role of concomitant characteristics and exposures
(Table 3). A history of TBI (hazard ratio [HR] ¼ 10.55, 95% CI ¼
5.20 to 21.42) or any hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT;
HR ¼ 6.32, 95% CI ¼ 3.19 to 12.55) strongly increased adenoma
risk; HCT without TBI did not (HR ¼ 0.87, 95% CI ¼ 0.11 to 7.25, n
¼ 1 case). In addition, survivors who had received abdominopel-
vic radiotherapy (not including TBI) had a statistically signifi-
cantly
higher
risk
compared
with
those
without
such
treatments (HR ¼ 2.12, 95% CI ¼ 1.24 to 3.60) without clear trends
of risk according to abdominopelvic radiation dose or estimated
exposed colorectal volume (Supplementary Tables 3 and 4,
available online). Cisplatin was statistically significantly associ-
ated with increased adenoma risk (HR ¼ 2.81, 95% CI ¼ 1.32 to
5.99; not shown) without strong evidence of a dose response
(HR ¼ 2.13, 95% CI ¼ 0.74 to 6.07 for <480 mg/m2; HR ¼ 3.85, 95%
CI ¼
1.45 to 10.26 for �480 mg/m2; Ptrend ¼ .62) (Table 3).
Cisplatin-associated adenoma risk was slightly attenuated in
sensitivity
analyses
excluding
hepatoblastoma
survivors
(HR ¼ 2.34, 95% CI ¼ 0.98 to 5.56) and excluding 2484 survivors of
Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS)–associated childhood cancers (leu-
kemia, central nervous system tumors, sarcoma, except Ewing;
HR ¼ 2.29, 95% CI ¼ 0.71 to 7.38; not shown). Among all survi-
vors, procarbazine was not associated with adenoma risk
(HR ¼ 1.27, 95% CI ¼ 0.50 to 3.19 for <6603 mg/m2; HR ¼ 1.67, 95%
CI ¼ 0.66 to 4.23 for �6603 mg/m2; Ptrend ¼ .79). Procarbazine was
statistically significantly associated with adenoma risk among
survivors who did not have abdominopelvic radiotherapy/TBI
(HR ¼ 2.71, 95% CI ¼ 1.28 to 5.74; not shown). Hepatoblastoma
survivors (HR ¼ 27.12, 95% CI ¼ 8.80 to 83.58) and cohort mem-
bers with a family history of early-onset CRC (n ¼ 15, including
five adenoma cases) had strongly increased risks of adenomas
(HR ¼ 20.46, 95% CI ¼ 8.10 to 51.70) (Table 3). Adjustments for

Indications for Colonoscopy
We obtained medical information regarding diagnostic testing
preceding colorectal adenoma diagnosis for 42 of 78 cases
(Supplementary Table 5, available online). Seventeen adenoma
patients had a colonoscopy ordered for abdominal symptoms
indicative of colorectal tumors. For another 17 individuals, the
adenoma was discovered during medical surveillance in high-
risk groups. In eight patients, adenoma represented an acciden-
tal finding on imaging/colonoscopy ordered for reasons other
than a suspected colorectal tumor. The findings were essen-
tially similar for patients with and without a history of colorec-
tal RT exposure. Results of treatment-related risk factors in
multivariable Cox models did not materially change when ex-
cluding 17 individuals who received surveillance colonoscopies
(not shown).

Figure 1. Cumulative incidence of colorectal adenomas for survivors with and without abdominopelvic radiotherapy and for siblings. Two-sided Pepe-Mori tests were
calculated to evaluate differences in cumulative incidences between groups. Pdifference ¼ .03 between survivors with abdominopelvic radiotherapy (RT)/total body irradi-
ation (TBI) vs siblings, Pdifference ¼ .07 between survivors with abdominopelvic RT/TBI vs survivors without abdominopelvic RT/TBI, Pdifference ¼ .29 for difference be-
tween survivors without abdominopelvic RT/TBI vs siblings. The cumulative incidence figure represents univariate comparisons. In multivariable Cox regression
analyses in survivors, both abdominopelvic radiotherapy (hazard ratio [HR] ¼ 2.11, 95% confidence interval [CI] ¼ 1.24 to 3.60) and total body irradiation (HR ¼ 10.55,
95% CI ¼ 5.20 to 21.42) were statistically significant risk factors. RT ¼ radiotherapy; TBI ¼ total body irradiation.

 Colorectal Cancer
Thirteen cohort members had a subsequent primary CRC (SIR ¼
3.3, 95% CI ¼ 1.8 to 5.7, EAR ¼ 1.1/10 000 PY), including eight co-
lon cancers (SIR ¼ 3.9, 95% CI ¼ 1.7 to 7.7, EAR ¼ 0.8/10 000 PY)
and five rectal cancers (SIR ¼ 3.6, 95% CI ¼ 1.2 to 8.5, EAR ¼
0.5/10 000 PY) (Table 4). Median age at CRC diagnosis was 36.5
years (range ¼ 23.1–56.0 years). The cumulative incidence of
CRC by age 45 years was 0.47% among survivors, compared with
0.15% expected (Supplementary Figure 3, available online). Four
CRC patients (30.7%) had received abdominopelvic radiother-
apy, five (38.5%) had received other radiotherapy (including one
with spinal radiotherapy), and most had some form of prior
chemotherapy (n ¼ 11, 84.6%). Four of 13 (30.8%) CRC cases had
received alkylating agents; none had received platinum agents.
Moreover, nine of 13 patients (69.2%) with subsequent CRC also
developed an adenoma; seven of them had a synchronous diag-
nosis of first adenoma and CRC.
Discussion
Our data show that childhood cancer survivors treated with ra-
diotherapy to the colorectal area—including TBI—are at in-
creased risk of adenomas compared with a sibling comparison
group and that childhood cancer survivors are at a more than
threefold increased risk of CRC compared with the general
population. To our knowledge, this is the first study to assess
the risk of and risk factors for histologically confirmed colorec-
tal adenomas among childhood cancer survivors, based on a co-
hort not subject to systematic colorectal tumor screening with
near-complete treatment characterization and follow-up up to
January 2017. Moreover, adenoma risk factors include prior
treatment with the chemotherapeutic agents cisplatin and pro-
carbazine, a personal history of hepatoblastoma (FAP related),
and a family history of early-onset CRC.
We showed an increased risk of CRC in our study group com-
pared with the general population. Over the past decade, sev-
eral high-quality follow-up studies among very long-term
childhood (1,2,19) and adult (4,20–22) cancer survivors reported
elevated CRC risk consistent with our results, in particular
among survivors of Wilms’ tumor and Hodgkin lymphoma after
high-dose abdominal radiotherapy (2,4,19). As most CRCs are
preceded by adenomas in the general population (9), we hy-
pothesized that risk factors for CRC and adenoma are similar.
Conversely, Brenner and colleagues estimated from a CRC
screening study among older citizens that less than half of all
adenomas advance to CRC during a life-time, including decreas-
ing conversion rates with attained age (23).
We found that survivors with previous abdominopelvic ra-
diotherapy/TBI were at increased risk of adenomas compared
with survivors treated otherwise, and in comparison with sib-
lings. The lack of radiation dose response is consistent with

*Model includes only 76 colorectal adenoma cases due to missing values. Supplementary Table 3 (available online) shows univariate results of all variables that were
evaluated. Variables that were evaluated in multivariable analysis but were not statistically significantly associated with adenoma risk and thus not included in this ta-
ble were volume of colorectal area in radiation field, maximum prescribed dose to the colorectal area (and interaction between volume and prescribed dose) (see
Supplementary Table 4, available online, for more details), carboplatin, childhood cancer diagnosis of medulloblastoma, etoposide, teniposide, mercaptopurin, and he-
matopoietic cell transplantation. Although hematopoietic cell transplantation was statistically significantly associated with adenoma risk in univariate analysis, this
variable did not statistically significantly increase adenoma risk in multivariable analysis when total body irradiation was also in the model. As total body irradiation
was still statistically significantly elevated when both variables were in the model, we choose to include total body irradiation in the final model rather than hemato-
poietic cell transplantation. An indicator variable for a childhood cancer diagnosis of hepatoblastoma was included because hepatoblastoma survivors have a highly
increased risk of familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP). All four hepatoblastoma cases had a confirmed genetic diagnosis of FAP. CI ¼ confidence interval; Gy ¼ Gray;

 findings from the only other large study on ionizing radiation
and adenoma risk, among Atomic Bomb survivors, who were
exposed to much lower median radiation doses (24). Several fac-
tors may contribute to the lack of radiation dose response for
adenoma in this exploratory study: the rather limited range of
cumulative maximum prescribed dose to the colorectal region
(median ¼ 30.0 Gy, interquartile range ¼ 20.0–35.2 Gy), the fact
that we used surrogates for true absorbed colon/rectum dose,
and the limited number of adenoma cases with any radiother-
apy exposure to the abdomen. The lack of volume effects may
be related to the validity of our proxy (ie, treatment field-based
estimation) for exposed colorectal volume; nonetheless, this
carefully constructed variable, in combination with treatment
dose, provides a more detailed classification of colorectal radia-
tion exposure than used in most other large-scale cohort stud-
ies of second tumor risk.
In our cohort, six survivors had more than 10 adenomas, in-
cluding two cases after abdominopelvic radiotherapy/TBI. All
TBI patients underwent HCT, and we hypothesize that HCT-
related factors other than ionizing radiation exposure might
contribute to the high excess risk, such as immune dys-
regulation or closer medical follow-up among HCT survivors,
who are at substantial risk for chronic health problems (25,26).
Most patients with TBI have received an allogeneic HCT includ-
ing intense treatment regimens. Despite rigorous adjustment
for single agents, some residual confounding may persist.
Previous cisplatin treatment, a putative risk factor for gastro-
intestinal tract cancer (1), is associated with adenoma risk in
our study. Although cisplatin was often part of hepatoblastoma
and bone sarcoma treatment, our sensitivity analyses excluding
hepatoblastoma and LFS-associated childhood cancer types
suggested that only a small part of the cisplatin-associated risk
could be attributed to LFS-associated genetic susceptibility. We
also observed a statistically significantly increased risk of ade-
nomas for the alkylating agent procarbazine, but only among
survivors without prior abdominopelvic radiotherapy or TBI.
Previous childhood cancer survivor studies implicated alkylat-
ing agent exposure as a risk factor for CRC (2) and procarbazine
as a risk factor for any gastrointestinal tract cancer (53% CRC)
(1). Associations with procarbazine have been reported among
survivors of young adult cancer (27–29).
In our study, four (8%) of a total of 52 hepatoblastoma survi-
vors developed an adenoma, all four with a confirmed FAP diag-
nosis
and
including
three
with
multiple
adenomas.
This
constellation of tumors constitutes well-established FAP fea-
tures (17,30,31). It is conceivable that other cohort members
with adenoma have genetic syndromes associated with in-
creased colon tumor risk, such as LFS (32); based on available
data, this was not apparent.
A major strength of our study is the large cohort size with
joint availability of detailed individual treatment information
and objective data on histologically confirmed adenomas from
linkage to the nationwide registry of histo- and cytopathology
(PALGA) for more than 95% of the study population (14).
Furthermore, the sibling comparison group enables assessment
of global excess risk.
Limitations include the slight chance of false-positive find-
ings with the PALGA linkage on family name, sex, and birth
date due to administrative twins. Also, as PALGA attained
nation-wide coverage in 1990, we left-truncated the follow-up
on January 1, 1990. Only 9% of potential person-years prior to
1990 were missed, predominantly among young individuals
(age < 30 years) (Supplementary Figure 1, available online).
Second,
for
adenoma
cases,
we
sought
information
on
colonoscopies. This was not attempted for more than 5700 sur-
vivors without an adenoma. Although some detection bias may
exist, the extent is likely small: Evidence-based DCOG-LATER
follow-up
recommendations,
with
adherence
in
all
seven
follow-up clinics, do not include active colorectal tumor surveil-
lance, eliminating screening bias. Moreover, less than 2% of co-
hort members are eligible yet for the population-based CRC
screening program for people age 55 to 75 years, which is being
implemented during 2014–2019 (33). Therefore, the lack of sys-
tematic colorectal tumor surveillance implies that not all inci-
dent, asymptomatic adenomas will be known. On the other
hand, survivors treated with abdominopelvic radiotherapy and/
or TBI are under more frequent late effects clinic surveillance
and may experience more abdominal complaints than those
treated with chemotherapy only, and may receive more abdominal
ultrasounds. This diagnostics tool is not suitable to detect colorec-
tal tumors whereas colonoscopies are mainly used in case of
symptoms indicative of tumors or inflammatory conditions.
Accordingly, few adenomas (8/42 ¼ 19%) were discovered inciden-
tally on imaging or during medical follow-up for symptoms other
than a suspected colorectal tumor, without clear differences be-
tween those with and without abdominopelvic radiotherapy/TBI; a
major bias is thus quite unlikely (Supplementary Table 5, available
online). Finally, a note of caution is in place with regard to the find-
ings for specific chemotherapy agents. It is well-recognized that
treatments are not homogeneously distributed in mixed childhood
cancer survivorship cohorts (13,34). As we did not demonstrate
clear dose response trends, we cannot exclude the possibility that
some of these agents in fact are surrogates for other factors not
captured otherwise.
Further studies are needed to validate our findings; however,
this is challenging in most settings as they require joint access
to individual treatment data and objective sources for assess-
ment of benign tumors in large cohorts (or nested studies
therein). As a majority of our cohort has not yet reached the
ages at which incidence of colorectal tumors in the general pop-
ulation is high, continued observational studies of colorectal
tumors in childhood cancer survivors are warranted.
Finally, detection of early-stage colorectal tumors decreases
CRC-specific mortality (6). Survivors with a family history of
early-onset CRC, a group for whom CRC surveillance was imple-
mented (35), were at greater than 20-fold increased risk of devel-
oping an adenoma. In our study, almost 70% of the CRC patients
also had an adenoma, often detected around the CRC diagnosis
date, which is suggestive of an adenoma-carcinoma sequence
in CRC pathogenesis; this hypothesis needs confirmation.
Screening among asymptomatic high-risk survivors is being
considered (1–3). At present, the US Children’s Oncology Group
is the only guideline group recommending a colonoscopy at a
minimum of every five years for survivors who received 30 Gy
or more abdominopelvic or spinal radiotherapy, from 10 years
after radiation or starting at age 35 years, whichever occurs last
(36).
National
guideline
groups
have
gathered
in
the
International Guideline Harmonization Group (IGHG) to evalu-
ate and harmonize recommendations for surveillance of late
effects after treatment for childhood and young adult cancer
based on evidence-based methods (37–39). IGHG’s work on CRC
surveillance is scheduled to start shortly.
In conclusion, we provide new evidence for excess risk of
histologically confirmed colorectal adenomas among childhood
cancer survivors. Treatment-related risk factors for adenoma
were abdominopelvic radiotherapy, TBI/HCT, cisplatin, and pro-
carbazine. Adenoma risk was strongly increased in hepatoblas-
toma survivors (FAP related) and in survivors with a family
