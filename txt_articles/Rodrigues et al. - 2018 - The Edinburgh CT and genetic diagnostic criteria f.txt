Summary
Background Identification of lobar spontaneous intracerebral haemorrhage associated with cerebral amyloid 
angiopathy (CAA) is important because it is associated with a higher risk of recurrent intracerebral haemorrhage than 
arteriolosclerosis-associated intracerebral haemorrhage. We aimed to develop a prediction model for the identification 
of CAA-associated lobar intracerebral haemorrhage using CT features and genotype.
Methods We identified adults with first-ever intracerebral haemorrhage diagnosed by CT, who died and underwent 
research autopsy as part of the Lothian IntraCerebral Haemorrhage, Pathology, Imaging and Neurological Outcome 
(LINCHPIN) study, a prospective, population-based, inception cohort. We determined APOE genotype and radiologists 
rated CT imaging appearances. Radiologists were not aware of clinical, genetic, and histopathological features. A 
neuropathologist rated brain tissue for small vessel diseases, including CAA, and was masked to clinical, radiographic, 
and genetic features. We used CT and APOE genotype data in a logistic regression model, which we internally 
validated using bootstrapping, to predict the risk of CAA-associated lobar intracerebral haemorrhage, derive diagnostic 
criteria, and estimate diagnostic accuracy.
Findings Among 110 adults (median age 83 years [IQR 76–87], 49 [45%] men) included in the LINCHPIN study between 
June 1, 2010 and Feb 10, 2016, intracerebral haemorrhage was lobar in 62 (56%) participants, deep in 41 (37%), and 
infratentorial in seven (6%). Of the 62 participants with lobar intracerebral haemorrhage, 36 (58%) were associated with 
moderate or severe CAA compared with 26 (42%) that were associated with absent or mild CAA, and were independently 
associated with subarachnoid haemorrhage (32 [89%] of 36 vs 11 [42%] of 26; p=0·014), intracerebral haemorrhage with 
finger-like projections (14 [39%] of 36 vs 0; p=0·043), and APOE ε4 possession (18 [50%] of 36 vs 2 [8%] of 26; p=0·0020). 
A prediction model for CAA-associated lobar intracerebral haemorrhage using these three variables had excellent 
discrimination (c statistic 0·92, 95% CI 0·86–0·98), confirmed by internal validation. For the rule-out criteria, neither 
subarachnoid haemorrhage nor APOE ε4 possession had 100% sensitivity (95% CI 88–100). For the rule-in criteria, 
subarachnoid haemorrhage and either APOE ε4 possession or finger-like projections had 96% specificity (95% CI 78–100).
Interpretation The CT and APOE genotype prediction model for CAA-associated lobar intracerebral haemorrhage 
shows excellent discrimination in this cohort, but requires external validation. The Edinburgh rule-in and rule-out 
diagnostic criteria might inform prognostic and therapeutic decisions that depend on identification of CAA-associated 
lobar intracerebral haemorrhage.

Introduction
About 85% of spontaneous intracerebral haemorrhages 
have no underlying macrovascular cause and are 
attributed to small vessel disease, mostly arteriolosclerosis 
with or without cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA).1,2 
CAA affects cortical and leptomeningeal vessels and is 
only associated with lobar intracerebral haemorrhage,3,4 
whereas arteriolosclerosis can cause intracerebral 
haemorrhage anywhere in the brain.
Identification of CAA-associated intracerebral haemor-
rhage is important because it is associated with a higher 
risk of recurrent intracerebral haemorrhage and post-
stroke dementia than arteriolosclerosis-associated intra-
cerebral haemorrhage,5,6 and might increase the risk of 
intracerebral haemorrhage in patients taking anti-
thrombotic drugs.7 Criteria to rule out CAA underlying 
intracerebral haemorrhage would allow clinicians to be 
more confident about the use of antithrombotic drugs;2,7 
ruling in CAA underlying intracerebral haemorrhage 
would provide important prognostic information.
The MRI-based modified Boston criteria have excellent 
sensitivity and good specificity for CAA.8 However, MRI

can be unsuitable for very unwell patients in the acute 
setting or for those patients with contraindications, 
such as non-MRI compatible implanted devices or 
claustrophobia, and might be unavailable particularly in 
low-income and middle-income countries where 75% of 
worldwide deaths due to haemorrhagic stroke occur.9
Other tests that can diagnose CAA include CT, which is 
usually the first test to diagnose intracerebral haemorrhage, 
and APOE genotype. Subarachnoid haem 
orrhage on CT 
occurs with 82% (95% CI 69–93) of cases of intracerebral 
haemorrhage accompanied by histopathologically proven 
CAA.10 The presence of an APOE ε4 allele is the strongest 
genetic association with histo 
pathologically confirmed 
sporadic CAA (odds ratio [OR] 2·67, 95% CI 2·31–3·08), 
and the association is dose dependent and occurs 
regardless of dementia comorbidity.11 However, the 
diagnostic use of CT features and APOE genotype—alone 
or in combination—is unknown.
We aimed to develop a multivariable prediction 
model for identifying lobar intracerebral haemorrhage 
associated with CAA using CT and genetic features, 
internally validate the model, and assess the diagnostic 
accuracy of different cutoffs to rule in and rule out 
CAA-associated intracerebral haemorrhage.
Methods
Study design and participants
We did a community-based inception cohort study of 
spontaneous 
intracerebral 
haemorrhage 
in 
the 
Lothian health board region of Scotland (the Lothian 
IntraCerebral 
Haemorrhage, 
Pathology, 
Imaging 
and Neurological Outcome [LINCHPIN] study).12 
We prospectively identified all incident cases of 
intracerebral haemorrhage with multiple overlapping 
sources of case ascertainment.1 We included consecutive 
adult patients (aged ≥16 years) with first-ever intracerebral 
haemorrhage confirmed by CT. We excluded patients 
with recurrent intracerebral haemorrhage; exclusively 
extra- 
axial intracranial haemorrhage; and intracerebral 
haemorrhage secondary to trauma, macrovascular 
causes, structural causes, or haemorrhagic trans 
form-
ation 
of 
an 
ischaemic 
stroke.1 
We 
collected 
demographics, medical history, and drug use at 
diagnosis of intracerebral haemorrhage data by 
interviewing patients or their families or carers at the 
time of presentation and reviewing primary care and 
hospital records.1
The

Research in context
Evidence before this study
We did a systematic review of studies on imaging features of 
lobar or cerebellar intracerebral haemorrhage with pathologically 
proven cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) published in 
MEDLINE (from 1946 to Nov 1, 2016) and Embase (from 1974 to 
Nov 1, 2016) using comprehensive electronic search strategies 
combining terms “stroke”, “cerebrovascular disorders”, (brain$ or 
cerebr$ or intracerebr$) adj5 (h?emorrhag$ or h?ematoma$), 
“amyloid beta-protein”, “cerebral amyloid angiopathy”, “vascular 
amyloidosis”, “congo red”, “pathology, clinical”, “pathology”, 
“histo?patholog$”, “post?mortem$” and “autops$” with no 
language restriction. We identified 22 case series describing 
imaging features of lobar or cerebellar intracerebral haemorrhage 
accompanying histopathologically proven CAA. Overall, the 
study quality was poor, with small sample sizes, unclear 
definitions of predictor or outcome variables, and infrequent 
masking of study assessors. The most frequently reported CT 
features of CAA-associated intracerebral haemorrhage in 21 case 
series were subarachnoid extension and an irregular intracerebral 
haemorrhage border. No diagnostic test accuracy studies have 
been done. Although the modified Boston MRI criteria are widely 
used for the identification of CAA-associated intracerebral 
haemorrhage, no CT-based diagnostic criteria exist for patients 
who cannot tolerate or do not have access to MRI.
Added value of this study
This diagnostic test accuracy study minimised biases, used 
masking, assessed inter-rater and intra-rater agreement, 
standardised index test and reference standard, and adhered to 
recommended approaches for analysis. We were able to 
develop a highly discriminatory and well calibrated prediction 
model using subarachnoid haemorrhage and finger-like 
projections from intracerebral haemorrhage on CT, and APOE 
ε4 possession, which was internally validated. We identified 
clinically useful probability cutoffs and two sets of diagnostic 
criteria that can rule in or rule out CAA-associated lobar 
intracerebral haemorrhage.
Implications of all the available evidence
Both the Boston MRI and the Edinburgh CT-based diagnostic 
criteria for CAA-associated lobar intracerebral haemorrhage are 
now available. The Edinburgh sensitive rule-out criteria and 
specific rule-in criteria based on CT and APOE genotype are 
potentially widely applicable for diagnostic, prognostic, and 
therapeutic decisions in everyday clinical practice if MRI is 
contraindicated, intolerable, or unavailable. Future research is 
required to externally validate these diagnostic criteria and 
evaluate their clinical use.

extra-axial 
haemorrhage 
(in 
the 
subarachnoid, 
subdural, or intra-ventricular spaces), finger-like 
projections (elongated extensions arising from the 
haematoma, longer than they are wide, regardless of 
whether they extended to the cortex or not [appendix], 
variably referred to as lobulated or multinodular 
appearance in others studies10,14), and other radiographic 
features (appendix). All raters did all assessments 
masked 
to 
clinical, 
genetic, 
and 
pathological 
information. We used the initial ratings done by MAR 
for primary analyses.
For APOE genotype analysis, we obtained DNA from 
peripheral blood samples or cerebellar tissue stored in the 
LINCHPIN brain bank with standard methods described 
in the appendix. Investigators were masked to clinical, CT, 
and pathological features during DNA extraction and 
genotyping (appendix). We classified APOE genotype as 
APOE ε2 possession if participants had at least one 
ε2 allele or APOE ε4 possession if they had at least one 
ε4 allele.
Reference test
One neuropathologist (CS) assessed post mortem brain 
tissue according to a standard operating procedure 
(appendix). The maximum interval from death to 
autopsy was 5 days. The same neuropathologist rated 
CAA features (appendix) with a consensus rating scale,15 
which rates the presence and severity of parenchymal 
and meningeal CAA (0–3); the presence of capillary 
CAA (0 or 1), and vasculopathy (0–2). Two neuro-
pathologists (CS and CH) rated the presence and 
severity of non-CAA (or other small vessel disease) 
features in the left cerebral hemisphere using 
haematoxylin and eosin staining with a modified 
version of a published scale:16 none (very mild, 
occasional arteriolosclerosis without media splitting or 
luminal narrowing), mild (widespread mild or focal 
moderate arteriolosclerosis), moderate (widespread 
moderate or focal severe arteriolosclerosis, with splitting 
of the media and narrowing of the lumen), or severe 
(widespread severe arteriolosclerosis, fibrinoid necrosis, 
lipohyalinosis, evidence of vascular occlusion with or 
without recanalisation; appendix). We made the CAA 
ratings similar to the other small vessel disease ratings 
by restricting them to the parenchymal CAA scores in 
the left cerebral hemisphere, which we summed and 
graded for a CAA burden category (0=none, 1–4=mild, 
5–8=moderate, and 9–12=severe). Macroscopic neuro-
pathological assessment could not be masked to 
intracerebral haemorrhage location, but investigators 
were masked to other CT features, clinical information, 
and genotype. For microscopic histopathological 
assessment, investigators were masked to intracerebral 
haemorrhage location when possible (ie, unless the 
intracerebral haemorrhage was included in one of the 
prespecified sampled regions), as well as other CT 
features, clinical information, and genotype.
Statistical analysis
We were unable to calculate the sample size required for 
a diagnostic test accuracy study because a systematic 
review10 identified only two retrospective cross-sectional 
studies that compared CT features of intracerebral 
haemorrhage associated with histopathologically proven 
CAA with intracerebral haemorrhage without CAA, but 
these two studies were at high risk of selection and 
information 
biases. 
Therefore, 
after 
completing 
recruitment to this prospective population-based study,1 
we used the largest sample size possible (n=110) from 
its nested brain bank and we restricted models to three 
predictors (nine outcomes per variable) to reduce 
overfitting.17 We did a post-hoc power calculation using a 
two-sided Z test for a logistic regression model with 
a 5% level of significance, with subarachnoid haemor-
rhage as the main predictor (OR 10·9) and adjusting for 
the effect of other covariates (Nagelkerke R² 0·06); this 
calculation showed that our maximum achievable 
sample size of 62 participants with lobar intracerebral 
haemorrhage would result in 70·6% power.
No data were missing from this study. We did statistical 
analyses using the R statistic package (version 3.3.2), 
with the exception of post-hoc power calculation and 
diagnostic accuracy statistics (sensitivity, specificity, 
likelihood ratios, and predictive values and their 95% CIs) 
which we obtained using G*Power 3.1.9.2 and VassarStats 
Clinical Calculator 1, respectively.

Prediction modelling and performance
The multivariable prediction model aimed to use CT 
features and APOE genotype to predict lobar intracerebral 
haemorrhage that was associated with CAA, defined as a 
CAA burden category of moderate or severe, with or 
without other small vessel disease.
We assessed intra-rater and inter-rater agreement of CT 
features using unweighted Cohen’s κ coefficient for 
categorical data, linear-weighted Cohen’s κ coefficient for 
ordinal data, and intra-class correlation coefficient for 
continuous data. We excluded radiographic features with 
κ less than 0·5 from further analyses. We compared the 
distributions of clinical, genetic, and CT characteristics in 
cases of lobar intracerebral haemorrhage with or without 
moderate or severe CAA using χ² test (or Fisher’s exact 
test, where appropriate) for categorical variables and the 
Mann-Whitney U test for non-normally distributed 
continuous variables. For the full model we prespecified 
subarachnoid haemorrhage and APOE ε4 possession on 
the basis of systematic review data.10,11 We included finger-
like projections from the intracerebral haemorrhage on 
the basis of the strong univariate association that 
we found with CAA-associated lobar intracerebral 
haemorrhage. We used Firth’s penalised likelihood logistic 
regression to assess the association of predictors with 
CAA-associated lobar intracerebral haemorrhage and 
calculate OR with 95% CIs, because finger-like projections 
showed complete separation between the two outcome 
groups.18 We assessed overall performance using 
Nagelkerke’s R², the Brier score, and the Akaike 
information criterion.19 We evaluated model dis 
crimination 
with the concordance (c) statistic and discrimination slope, 
and displayed the discrimination graphically using a 
receiver operating characteristic plot. We assessed model 
calibration with the Hosmer–Lemeshow goodness-of-fit 
test and calibration plots. We used bootstrapping to 
evaluate the internal validity of the model performance 
measures.20 We used 2000 random bootstrap samples with 
replacement from the full sample of participants with 
lobar intracerebral haemorrhage, constructed models on 
these bootstrap samples, and derived optimism-adjusted 
performance measures to provide a realistic estimate of 
future performance.19 
Development of diagnostic criteria
We defined three risk categories for CAA-associated lobar 
intracerebral haemorrhage according to the probability 
of CAA-associated intracerebral haemorrhage predicted 
by the model: low (≤7%), medium (44–64%), and 
high (≥95%). We used decision curve analysis, which 
assesses the use of different risk category cutoffs across 
the full range of threshold probabilities and false positive 
and false negative weighting, to confirm the optimum 
risk category cutoffs for ruling CAA-associated intra-
cerebral haemorrhage either in or out.21 We evaluated the 
sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative likelihood 
ratios, and predictive values and their 95% CIs for the

Results
Between June 1, 2010, and Feb 10, 2016, 110 participants 
underwent research autopsy after non-contrast head CT 
that 
initially 
diagnosed 
first-ever 
intracerebral 
haemorrhage, after unavoidable exclusions (appendix).12 
The median age was 83 years (IQR 76–87) and 
49 (45%) were men (appendix). DNA for APOE genotyping 
was available for all 110 participants (peripheral blood 
sample for 28 participants and post-mortem cerebellar 
tissue for 82 participants). The median time from 
intracerebral haemorrhage to CT was 5 h (IQR 3–18) and 
the median time from CT to autopsy was 11 days (5–80). 
For most radiographic features, intra-rater agreement was 
substantial to almost perfect and inter-rater agreement 
was moderate to almost perfect (appendix).
62 
(56%) 
participants 
had 
lobar 
intracerebral 
haemorrhage, 41 (37%) had deep intracerebral haemor-
rhage, and seven (6%) had infratentorial intracerebral 
haemorrhage (appendix). All 48 participants with non-
lobar intracerebral haemorrhage had moderate or severe 
other small vessel disease: most (n=42 [88%]) had other 
small vessel disease with absent or mild CAA and 
six (13%) also had moderate or severe CAA, consistent 
with the population prevalence of CAA in octogenarians 
(figure 1, appendix).2 Therefore, we focused our further 
analyses on the prediction of moderate or severe CAA in 
participants with lobar intracerebral haemorrhage.
Of 62 participants with lobar intracerebral haemorrhage, 
26 (42%) had moderate or severe other small vessel 
disease as well as moderate or severe CAA, 24 (39%) had 
moderate or severe other small vessel disease alone, 
ten (16%) had moderate or severe CAA alone, and 
two (3%) had no clear underlying cause of intracerebral 
haemorrhage (one participant had mild CAA and mild 
other small vessel disease, and the second participant had 
mild other small vessel disease and absent CAA, but 
neither had a macrovascular abnormality, coagulopathy, 
or tumour; figure 1). In univariable analyses, participants 
with lobar intracerebral haemorrhage and moderate or 
severe CAA were significantly more likely to be 
APOE ε4 carriers, and to have a strictly lobar intracerebral 
haemorrhage, subarachnoid haemorrhage, and finger-like 
projections from the intracerebral haemorrhage than 
participants with lobar intracerebral haemorrhage and 
absent or mild CAA (table 1).

The multivariable prediction model for CAA-associated 
lobar intracerebral haemorrhage included three pre-
dictors: APOE ε4 possession, subarachnoid haemorrhage, 
and finger-like projections (table 2). The model calculates 
the predicted probability of moderate or severe CAA as 
follows (the predictor values are 1 when present and 0 
when absent):
All three predictors were independently associated with 
moderate or severe CAA. The variance inflation factor 
values (APOE ε4 carrier 1·33, subarachnoid haemorrhage 
1·34, and finger-like projections 1·03) confirmed no 
evidence of multi 
collinearity between predictors. We did 
a sensitivity analysis excluding participants taking oral 
anticoagulants (n=9), given the high frequency of 
finger-like projections in such cases,22 which showed 
similar significance, direction, and magnitude of the 
independent associations (appendix).
The 
model 
showed 
excellent 
discrimination 
(c statistic 0·92, 95% CI 0·86–0·98) with no evidence of 
poor calibration (Hosmer–Lemeshow goodness of fit test 
p=0·685; figure 2, appendix). Internal validation 
identified small differences in the overall performance 
measures 
(eg, 
the 
Brier 
score 
increased 
from 
0·11 to 0·12 and the c statistic decreased from 0·92 to 0·91), 
with no evidence of poor calibration (appendix).
We used the multivariable model to select two cutoff
 
points to stratify the probability of moderate or severe 
CAA into low, medium, or high risk (appendix). When 
no predictors were present (low risk), the predicted 
probability of moderate or severe CAA was 7%. 
Subarachnoid haemorrhage or APOE ε4 possession in 
isolation (medium risk) predicted 44–64% probability of 
moderate or severe CAA. The presence of subarachnoid 
haemorrhage and at least one other predictor (high risk) 
predicted a probability of moderate or severe CAA of 
95% or more.
Guided by how the predictors stratified the probability 
of moderate or severe CAA associated with lobar 
intracerebral haemorrhage, we identified two sets of 
diagnostic criteria including the three predictors 
(appendix, figure 3). Subarachnoid haemorrhage or 
APOE ε4 possession separated low from medium or high 
probability groups (appendix), and had a sensitivity of 
100% (95% CI 88–100; appendix) meaning that the 
absence of these two predictors with lobar intracerebral 
haemorrhage ruled out moderate or severe CAA. 
Subarachnoid haemorrhage and APOE ε4 possession or 
finger-like projections, separated high from low or 
medium probability groups (appendix), and had a 
specificity of 96% (95% CI 78–100; appendix) meaning 
that the presence of these predictors with lobar 
intracerebral haemorrhage ruled in moderate or severe 
CAA. These optimum risk category cutoffs for ruling 
CAA-associated intracerebral haemorrhage either in or 
out were confirmed by decision curve analysis (appendix).
We repeated the prediction modelling and derived 
diagnostic criteria using CT ratings from a second 
independent investigator (PMW). The prediction model 
shows similar direction and magnitude of the predictors 
with moderate or severe CAA, while the sensitivity of 
the rule-out criteria remained 100% and specificity of 
the rule-in criteria increased to 100% (appendix).

We did a comparison of our CT and genetic criteria 
with the modified Boston criteria8 in the seven 
participants with lobar intracerebral haemorrhage who 
subsequently had MRI done within 6 months of the 
intracerebral haemorrhage, and found that all cases at 
high or intermediate probability of having moderate or 
severe CAA by our Edinburgh criteria were classified as 
probable CAA by the Boston criteria (appendix).
Since APOE genotyping might not be available 
worldwide, we assessed the diagnostic test accuracy of a 
simplified model on the basis of CT features alone 
(appendix). Subarachnoid haemorrhage alone had a 
sensitivity of 89% (95% CI 73–96) and the combination 
of subarachnoid haemorrhage and finger-like projections 
had 100% (95% CI 84–100) specificity (appendix). 
However, the inclusion of APOE ε4 improved the model 
(full model χ²=59·0, Akaike information criterion=49·9 
vs 
simpli 
fied 
CT-based 
model 
χ²=41·9, 
Akaike 
information criterion=65·0, p<0·0001).
Discussion
In our study, we used a systematically acquired brain 
tissue bank nested within a prospective, population-based 
cohort study to develop and internally validate a simple, 
three-variable model using two CT features (subarachnoid 
haemorrhage and finger-like projections from intra-
cerebral haemorrhage) and APOE genotype to predict 
moderate or severe CAA associated with lobar 
intracerebral haemorrhage. The model had excellent 
discrimination and calibration. The diagnostic criteria 
might inform estimates of prognosis and decisions about 
antithrombotic drugs after intracerebral haemorrhage.
We identified two clinically useful diagnostic cutoffs that 
have 
implications 
for 
clinical 
practice. 
Neither 
subarachnoid haemorrhage nor APOE ε4 possession was 
100% sensitive for moderate or severe CAA with a negative 
likelihood ratio of 0; a negative likelihood of less than 
0·1 means a negative test is good at ruling out a diagnosis.24 
Therefore, the absence of these features can rule out 
CAA-associated lobar intracerebral haemorrhage, which 
might identify people with a lower risk of recurrent 
intracerebral haemorrhage,5,25 dementia,6 and susceptibility 
to the effects of anti 
thrombotic drugs.7 The presence of 
subarachnoid haemorrhage and APOE ε4 possession or 
finger-like projections was 96% specific with a positive 
likelihood ratio 16·6. A positive likelihood of more than 
10 means a positive test is good at ruling in a diagnosis,24 so 
the presence of these features can effectively rule in CAA-
associated lobar intracerebral haemorrhage to identify 
patients for studies of CAA treatment. 
Our diagnostic criteria are based on features identified 
on non-contrast CT, a widely available, relatively 
inexpensive diagnostic test with few contraindications, 
which is suitable in acutely unwell patients. The intra-
rater and inter-rater agreement for subarachnoid 
haemorrhage and finger-like projections were moderate 
to almost perfect. Although APOE genotyping using 
peripheral blood samples is not a universally available 
test, the inclusion of APOE ε4 possession significantly 
improves the prediction model. Given the drive towards 
stratified medicine, these techniques are becoming 
increasingly cost-effective.26 Our criteria could be used in 
other patient groups to help guide the use of more 
restricted clinical resources by identifying patients who 
might benefit from advanced imaging, such as MRI or 
PET to assess for further features of CAA and other small 
vessel disease biomarkers.
This study minimised selection bias by using prospective 
case ascertainment in one community and inviting all 
potentially eligible people to consent to the nested brain 
bank. We minimised information bias by standardising 
imaging format; defining and systematically assessing 
radiographic 
features; 
standard 
ising 
brain 
tissue 
acquisition; extensively sampling brain tissue, rather than 
using cortical biopsy; systematically assessing pathological 
features; using validated rating scales;15,16,27 and masking 
assessors. No data were missing and inter-rater agreement 
was moderate to substantial for the key predictors. We 
chose logistic regression rather than machine-learning 
approaches, such as neural networks, for our prediction 
model, because of its simplicity, familiarity, and 
transparency. We reduced overfitting by restricting the 
multivariable model to three predictors, prespecified two 
of these predictors, and avoided stepwise methods of 
predictor selection due to the probable instability of 
selection related to the sample size. We did internal 
validation with bootstrapping to further reduce optimism 
in study performance measures.
This study has some limitations. Sample size was 
modest and the post-hoc power calculation shows that the 
study has 71% power and therefore is at risk of a type II 
error. Our sample size left us unable to develop criteria to 
distinguish lobar intracerebral haemorrhage associated 
with CAA alone, other small vessel disease alone, and 
mixed CAA and other small vessel disease, which could 
be clinically important. However, this study has the 
largest sample we could achieve over 6 years in a 
population of about 850 000 people, with roughly 
50% consenting soon after an acute brain injury,12 which 
is comparable with other brain banks.28
Although we tried to limit selection bias, participants 
who underwent autopsy were older, had larger intra-
cerebral haemorrhage, more frequent intra 
ventricular 
extension, and more severe posterior white matter 
lucencies, and generally died soon after their intracerebral 
haemorrhage compared with participants who did not 
(appendix); these differences were inevitable in standard 
clinical practice, and indicate to whom our results are 
generalisable. Whilst the frequency of model predictors 
(APOE ε4 possession, subarachnoid haemorrhage and 
finger-like projections) and the distribution of risk 
categories did not vary between those participants who 
underwent autopsy and those participants who did not 
undergo autopsy (appendix), the applicability of our

criteria to other intracerebral haemorrhage groups—such 
as 
younger 
patients 
with 
smaller 
intracerebral 
haemorrhage—is unclear.
We only identified finger-like projections in cases of 
lobar intracerebral haemorrhage with moderate or severe 
CAA, making them very specific for CAA-associated 
haemorrhage. However, finger-like projections are 
difficult to define, subjective, and potentially prone to 
observer variability. We used both written and pictorial 
definitions to improve reliability and showed substantial 
intra-rater 
and 
moderate 
inter-rater 
agreement. 
Furthermore, we repeated the model 
ling using ratings 
from a second independent investigator, which resulted 
in rule-out criteria with 100% sensitivity and rule-in 
criteria with 100% specificity for CAA-associated lobar 
intracerebral haemorrhage. Previous studies10 have 
reported that irregular and lobulated intracerebral 
haemorrhage borders are more frequently associated 
with CAA-associated lobar intracerebral haemorrhage. 
However, these features were not defined in the studies, 
making them difficult to relate to our findings.
Finally, CT features of intracerebral haemorrhage, such 
as subarachnoid haemorrhage and finger-like projections, 
will evolve with time. The timecourse for this evolution in 
intracerebral haemorrhage is unknown and how it might 
affect the diagnostic accuracy of these criteria is unclear. 
We would expect a reduction in sensitivity with time, 
however our rule-out criteria remain 100% sensitive 
despite including participants who had a CT scan up to 
7 days after symptom onset.
We are planning an external validation study to assess 
the performance of the prediction model and diagnostic 
criteria in other settings, countries, ethnic groups, and 
patient populations, such as those patients with 
smaller intracerebral haemorrhage, and determine the 
reproducibility 
of 
predictor 
assessment 
by 
other 
investigators (Greenberg SM, Massachusetts General 
Hospital, Boston, MA, USA, personal communication). 
Further large, representative samples with a systematic 
reference standard based on autopsy could attempt to 
distinguish lobar intracerebral haemorrhage associated 
with CAA alone, other small vessel disease alone, and 
mixed CAA and other small vessel disease. Comparison of 
these CT and genetic criteria and the widely used modified 
Boston criteria8 against a pathological reference standard 
would be noteworthy. Studies of the clinical and economic 
impact of these criteria on prognosis and therapeutic 
decisions might quantify, and hopefully confirm, their 
effect on the outcome of this devastating disease.
