In contrast to infections with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) 
in humans and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) in macaques, 
SIV infection of a natural host, sooty mangabeys (Cercocebus atys), 
is non-pathogenic despite high viraemia1. Here we sequenced and 
assembled the genome of a captive sooty mangabey. We conducted 
genome-wide comparative analyses of transcript assemblies from 
 
C. atys and AIDS-susceptible species, such as humans and macaques, 
to identify candidates for host genetic factors that influence 
susceptibility. We identified several immune-related genes in 
the genome of C. atys that show substantial sequence divergence 
from macaques or humans. One of these sequence divergences, 
a C-terminal frameshift in the toll-like receptor-4 (TLR4) gene 
of C. atys, is associated with a blunted in vitro response to TLR-4 
ligands. In addition, we found a major structural change in exons 
3–4 of the immune-regulatory protein intercellular adhesion 
molecule 2 (ICAM-2); expression of this variant leads to reduced 
cell surface expression of ICAM-2. These data provide a resource for 
comparative genomic studies of HIV and/or SIV pathogenesis and 
may help to elucidate the mechanisms by which SIV-infected sooty 
mangabeys avoid AIDS.
SIV infection of natural hosts, such as sooty mangabeys, is typically 
non-pathogenic despite high viraemia. This is in stark contrast to 
HIV infection in humans and experimental SIV infection in rhesus 
macaques (Macaca mulatta) that progress to AIDS unless treated with 
antiretroviral therapy. The main virological and immunological fea-
tures of natural SIV infection in sooty mangabeys have been described 
over the past 15 years in studies that compared and contrasted this 
infection with the pathogenic infections of HIV and SIV in humans 
and rhesus macaques1. SIV-infected sooty mangabeys show several fea-
tures that have been observed in pathogenic infections, including high 
viraemia, short in vivo lifespan of productively infected cells, depletion 
of mucosal CD4+ T cells, strong type-I interferon response in the acute 
infection, and cellular immune responses that fail to control virus rep-
lication. However, in contrast to pathogenic infections, SIV-infected 
sooty mangabeys (i) have healthy CD4+ T cell levels; (ii) do not expe-
rience mucosal immune dysfunction, avoiding depletion of T helper 17 
(TH17) cells, intestinal epithelial damage and microbial translocation; 
(iii) maintain low levels of immune activation during the chronic infec-
tion; and (iv) achieve compartmentalization of virus replication that 
preserves central-memory and stem-cell memory CD4+ T cells as well 
as follicular TH cells1,2. An additional notable feature of SIV infection 
in natural hosts is the low rate of mother-to-infant transmission that is 
related to low expression of CCR5 on circulating and mucosal CD4+ T 
cells3. Although many aspects of the natural course of SIV infection in 
sooty mangabeys have now been described, the key molecular mecha-
nisms by which these animals avoid AIDS remain poorly understood.
In this study, we sequenced the genome of a captive sooty mangabey 
and compared this genome to the genomes of AIDS-susceptible pri-
mates to look for candidate genes that may influence susceptibility 
 
to AIDS in SIV-infected hosts. We sequenced genomic DNA to a 
whole-genome coverage of about 180× 
 using the Illumina HiSeq 
2000 platform, and produced an initial assembly using ALLPATHS-LG, 
Atlas-Link and Atlas-GapFill (see Methods for details). The total size 
of the assembled C. atys genome (Caty_1.0; NCBI accession num-
ber GCA_000955945.1) is around 2.85 Gb, with a contig N50 size of 
112.9 kb and scaffold N50 size of 12.85 Mb (Table 1). Genome anno-
tation identified 20,829 protein-coding genes and 4,464 non-coding 
genes in the C. atys assembly, which is comparable to other available 
draft quality genomes of nonhuman primates (Table 1). These anal-
yses demonstrate that the Caty_1.0 reference genome is of sufficient 
quality to facilitate population-scale whole-genome and transcriptome 
sequencing studies.
To identify novel immunogenetic factors specific to C. atys that may 
be involved in the ability of this species to avoid progression to AIDS, 
we established a bioinformatic pipeline for a comparative protein analy-
sis (Fig. 1 and Extended Data Fig. 1, see Methods for details). Using this 
approach, we found 34 candidate immune-related genes with sequences 
that diverged between C. atys and M. mulatta (Table 1 and Extended 
Data Table 1). Although we cannot exclude a role of immune genes 
with minor differences in C. atys and M. mulatta, the highly divergent 
genes listed in Table 1 and Extended Data Table 1 constitute candidate 
genes involved in the outcomes of SIV infection in these two species.
Our screen identified sequence divergence in a number of proteins 
that are important during HIV infection, such as APOBEC3C (91.6%) 
and BST2 (also known as tetherin, 95.1%), as well as pattern-recognition 
 
receptors (MBL2, CLEC4A, CLEC4D and CLEC6A), the antiviral 
sensor cyclic GMP–AMP synthase (cGAS (also known as MB21D1)) 
and other immune mediators (Extended Data Table 1). Because 
CD4 and CCR5 are important for AIDS pathogenesis, we aligned 
the sequences of CaCD4 and CaCCR5 to MmCD4 and MmCCR5, 
 
respectively4,5. Neither gene showed any major structural changes 
in the wild-type variants, although CD4 was slightly below the 97%

threshold of identity (Extended Data Fig. 1b, c). In addition, we found 
specific gene families in C. atys that are expanded relative to M. mulatta, 
humans and other primates (Extended Data Table 2a). Notably, we 
detected localized regions of increased substitution, defined by a clus-
tered difference of three or more amino acids, in 10 genes. The most 
marked variations in the amino acid sequence of C. atys compared to 
M. mulatta were observed in ICAM-2 and TLR-4 (Table 1).
ICAM-2 is an approximately 60-kDa transmembrane glycoprotein 
of the immunoglobulin superfamily, which is expressed on various 
immune cells and implicated in lymphocyte homing and recircula-
tion6. ICAM-2 ligands are lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1 
and the C-type lectin DC-SIGN7. We discovered a misalignment of 
the ICAM-2 proteins between C. atys and M. mulatta that starts in 
exon 3 (Extended Data Fig. 2a). This difference is explained by a 499-
bp deletion starting from exon 3 of CaICAM2, as detected by PCR 
and Sanger sequencing (Fig. 2a and Extended Data Fig. 3). We subse-
quently confirmed the expression of this truncated form of ICAM-2 
in ten out of ten additional C. atys genome sequences (Extended Data 
Fig. 2b). By contrast, analysis of the whole-genome sequences of 15 
baboons and more than 130 rhesus macaques demonstrated that only 
the full-length ICAM-2 protein was found in all individuals (data not 
shown)8. The ICAM-2 deletion may be specific to C. atys, as it is not 
present in any other known primate sequences, including other nat-
ural SIV hosts, such as the African green monkey, drill and colobus 
monkey. Transcript models generated from de novo assembled C. atys 
RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) data from 14 different tissues showed that 
the mature mRNA sequence of CaICAM2 retains substantial portions 
of what is part of the intronic sequence in other nonhuman primates, 
and thus codes for a markedly different final gene product (Extended 
Data Figs 2, 3). Splice-junction sequence analysis showed intact splicing 
for all four exons in M. mulatta, but no splice junctions were found 
between exons 3 and 4 in C. atys, indicating severe splicing defects due 
to the deletion (Extended Data Fig. 4).
To test whether the observed genetic difference in ICAM2 has 
functional consequences, we measured ICAM-2 surface expression 
on immune cells from humans, M. mulatta and C. atys with an anti-
body that recognizes a conserved epitope between these species9. 
ICAM-2 was readily detected on T cells and B cells from humans and 
M. mulatta, but not from C. atys (Fig. 2b, c), suggesting that ICAM-2 is 
not functional in lymphocytes of C. atys. However, a truncated, lower

molecular weight form of ICAM-2 could be detected intracellularly by 
western blot in C. atys cells (Fig. 2d), thus demonstrating the presence 
of the predicted truncated ICAM-2 protein. Overall, these data indi-
cate that the presence of a species-specific gene sequence difference 
in CaICAM2 results in the abrogation of surface expression of this 
 
protein in C. atys. Further studies are needed to elucidate potential links 
between this truncated form of ICAM-2 and the remarkable immuno-
logical features of SIV infection in this species.
TLR-4 is a pattern recognition receptor that senses lipopolysaccha-
rides (LPS) on gram-negative bacteria and initiates pro-inflammatory 
 
cytokine induction, maturation and activation in macrophages, 
 
dendritic cells and other immune cells. During pathogenic HIV or 
SIV infections, exacerbated TLR-4 stimulation and concomitant pro- 
inflammatory signalling elicited by microbial translocation is con-
sidered a primary mechanism that underlies HIV-induced chronic 
immune activation10,11. Here, we found that the TLR-4 protein 
sequences of M. mulatta and C. atys are markedly different at the 
 
C terminus (Extended Data Fig. 5a). We confirmed the underlying 
difference in the TLR4 nucleotide sequence by Sanger sequencing 
(Extended Data Fig. 5b, c). We next analysed the genomic DNA sequence 
of TLR4 in 10 additional sooty mangabeys and found that the observed 
DNA sequence difference was present in all individuals (Extended Data 
 
Fig. 6a). Alignment of TLR-4 protein sequences from different primate 
species revealed that the 17-amino-acid longer C-terminal sequence 
is only found in natural SIV hosts, such as African green monkey, drill 
and colobus monkey (Fig. 3a), whereas non-natural hosts, including 
 
M. mulatta and baboons show expression of the short TLR-4 
C-terminal sequence.
The divergence of TLR-4 amino acid sequences amongst Old World 
primates shows an interesting pattern of molecular evolution. First, 
the genomic sequence encoding the TLR4 C terminus is defined by 
a 1-bp deletion causing a frame shift in all Old World monkeys, both 
natural and non-natural hosts, including colobine and cercopithecine 
lineages, but it is not found in either hominoids (apes and humans) 
or platyrrhines (New World monkeys) (Extended Data Fig. 6b). This 
suggests that this mutation occurred after the hominoid–Old World 
monkey divergence approximately 25 million years ago12. Second, there 
is a G-to-A nucleotide substitution in the non-natural host Old World 
monkeys (baboons and macaques) that creates a truncated protein in 
these species8 (Extended Data Fig. 6b). Although a naive analysis of 
this pattern would suggest two independent mutational changes in 
TLR4, the short internal branch of the species tree implies that incom-
plete lineage sorting of an ancestral polymorphism could also generate 
this pattern13 (Fig. 3b). To test this hypothesis, we examined the TLR4 
gene tree among 17 primate species. While generally supporting the 
relationships among these species (Fig. 3b), the analysis also found 
a number of nucleotide positions—spaced throughout the gene— 
consistent with incomplete lineage sorting between C. atys, baboon 
and M. mulatta (Extended Data Fig. 7). The incomplete lineage sorting 
hypothesis is also more likely, given that balancing selection is often 
found to be acting on immune-related genes. Therefore, even though 
baboons are believed to be more closely related to sooty mangabeys and 
drills than to rhesus macaques, the phylogeny of Old World monkeys 
is compatible with the possibility of a single G-to-A mutation creating 
the truncated form of the protein in the common ancestor of baboons, 
rhesus macaques and sooty mangabeys12,14 (Fig. 3b).
We next investigated potential differences in TLR-4 function between 
M. mulatta and C. atys. Our previous work has shown that mac-
rophages from C. atys exhibit higher expression of tetherin, APOBEC 
and TRIM5α 
 in response to LPS compared to M. mulatta15. This is 
consistent with the relative resistance of C. atys macrophages to in vivo 
SIV infection after experimental CD4+ T cell depletion compared to 
SIV-infected M. mulatta macrophages16. Here we analysed cytokine 
gene expression and protein production after LPS stimulation, and 
found reduced mRNA expression and secretion of TNF (also known 
as TNF-α 
) and IL-6 in cells from C. atys compared to M. mulatta  
(Fig. 3c, d). Because some commercial LPS preparations contain 
lipoprotein contaminants that can induce TLR-2 signalling, we con-
firmed the TLR-4 specificity of the reduced LPS response using the 
selective TLR-4 agonist17 lipid-A (Extended Data Fig. 8a, b). Next, 
we found that the species-specific differences between C. atys and M. 
mulatta in LPS-induced TNF and IL-6 production were maintained 
in acute and chronic infection (Fig. 3e and Extended Data Fig. 8c). 
Additionally, we did not observe any difference in the mRNA levels

of TLR4 in cells from C. atys and M. mulatta, nor did the expres-
sion of any factors in the TLR-4–MyD88–TRIF signalling axis cor-
relate with TNF and IL-6 production (Extended Data Fig. 8d and 
Extended Data Table 3). To more broadly characterize the effect of 
attenuated TLR-4 signalling in C. atys, we performed compara-
tive RNA-seq profiling of LPS-treated monocytes, and found lower 
production of CaTNF and CaIL6 mRNA (Extended Data Fig. 8e). 
Moreover, using gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), we observed 
that induction of pro-inflammatory genes was broadly and significantly 
reduced in cells from C. atys (Fig. 3f, g and Extended Data Fig. 9). 
 
Overall, these results indicate that LPS stimulation of blood cells 
from C. atys results in a blunted production of pro-inflammatory 
cytokines. To establish a link between the C-terminal TLR4 sequence 
difference and the responsiveness to LPS, we analysed the TLR-4 
 
orthologues of humans, C. atys and M. mulatta in an NF-κ 
B reporter 
assay. We observed a significantly attenuated NF-κ 
B response to LPS of 
 
C. atys TLR-4 (CaTLR-4) compared to M. mulatta TLR-4 (MmTLR-4). 
Using chimaeric constructs encoding MmTLR4 with the C terminus of 
CaTLR4 or CaTLR4 with the C terminus of MmTLR4, we confirmed 
that the TLR4 C terminus is responsible for this phenotypic difference 
(Fig. 3h). This demonstrates a sequence–function relationship of the 
TLR4 C terminus and suggests a novel mechanism contributing to 
 
the lower immune activation of SIV-infected sooty mangabeys.
Over the past decade the genomes of more than 25 nonhuman 
 
primate species have been sequenced, assembled and annotated18. This 
knowledge has improved our understanding of primate evolution, 
 
biology and general physiology, which has informed human biology 
 
and medicine. Here, we report a high-coverage, high-contiguity 
whole-genome sequence for C. atys, a natural SIV host. Comparative 
genomic analyses of natural and non-natural SIV hosts provide 
 
candidate genes that potentially influence susceptibility to AIDS 
in SIV-infected hosts. We have previously used trancriptomics to

characterize the host response to SIV infection of C. atys and African green 
 
monkeys19,20. Here, we examined the mechanisms of AIDS resistance 
of a natural SIV host genome-wide using genome sequencing. We iden-
tified candidate genes that show sequence changes that are specific to 
 
C. atys and two gene products (ICAM-2 and TLR-4), which show struc-
tural differences between C. atys and M. mulatta that may influence 
cell-surface expression (ICAM-2) and downstream signalling (TLR-4) 
of these proteins. Our findings may also explain prior results showing 
that not all natural SIV hosts respond to infection in the same way, sug-
gesting that in each primate species, multiple distinct mechanisms may 
contribute to the phenotype, rather than mutations in single genes, as 
has been purported, and eventually refuted, in other studies21. Further 
comparative studies with additional natural SIV host species may 
 
identify additional similarities (or differences) in the genes involved 
in the evolutionary pathways that led to AIDS resistance in different 
species of African nonhuman primates.
In this study, we used whole-genome sequencing and comparative 
genomic analysis to identify candidate genes regulating host resistance 
to AIDS. Future studies in which these candidate genes are manipulated 
in vivo during SIV infection are needed to characterize to what extent 
these genes may influence the non-pathogenic nature of SIV infection 
in sooty mangabeys.

Sequencing and assembly of the sooty mangabey genome. DNA from a female 
sooty mangabey (C. atys) born and maintained at the Yerkes National Primate 
Research Center was extracted from whole blood. The animal selected for sequencing 
 
was one of the original dams of a large matrilineal line of the colony. In addition, 
she possessed the most common MHC haplotype observed within the group. As 
such, her genetic constitution within the closed population was thought to be the 
most representative of any single animal. All animals were housed at the Yerkes 
National Primate Research Center of Emory University and maintained in accord-
ance with US NIH guidelines. All studies were approved by the Emory University 
Institutional Animal Care and Usage Committee. Following quality control to 
ensure purity and molecular weight, a series of Illumina sequencing libraries were 
prepared using standard procedures. Paired-end libraries with nominal insert sizes 
180 bp and 500 bp were produced. In brief, 1 μ 
g of DNA was sheared to the desired 
size using a Covaris S-2 system. Sheared fragments were purified with Agencourt 
AMPure XP beads, end-repaired, dA-tailed and ligated to Illumina universal adap-
tors. After adaptor ligation, DNA fragments were further size selected by agarose 
gel and PCR amplified for six to eight cycles using Illumina P1 and Index primer 
pair and Phusion High-Fidelity PCR Master Mix (New England Biolabs). The 
final library was purified using Agencourt AMPure XP beads and quality assessed 
by Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 (DNA 7500 kit) to determine library quantity and 
fragment size distribution before sequencing.
Long mate-pair libraries with 2-kb, 3-kb, 5-kb and 8-kb insert sizes were con-
structed according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Mate Pair Library v.2 Sample 
Preparation Guide 15001464 Rev. A Pilot Release). In brief, 5 μ 
g (for 2- and 3-kb 
size libraries) or 10 μ 
g (5- and 8-kb libraries) of genomic DNA was sheared to 
the desired size by Hydroshear (Digilab), then end-repaired and biotinylated. 
Fragment sizes between 1.8–2.5 kb (2 kb), 3.0–3.7 kb (3 kb), 4.5–6.0 kb (5 kb) or 
8–10 kb (8 kb) were purified from a 1% low-melting agarose gel and circularized by 
blunt-end ligation. These size-selected circular DNA fragments were then sheared 
to 400 bp (Covaris S-2), purified using Dynabeads M-280 Streptavidin Magnetic 
Beads, end-repaired, dA-tailed and ligated to Illumina PE sequencing adapters. 
DNA fragments with adaptor molecules on both ends were amplified for 12 to 
15 cycles with Illumina P1 and Index primers. Amplified DNA fragments were 
purified with Agencourt AMPure XP beads. Quantification and size distribution 
of the final library was determined as described above before sequencing.
Sequencing was performed on Illumina HiSeq 2000 instruments, generating 
100-bp paired-end reads. Raw sequences have been deposited in NCBI under 
Bioproject PRJNA157077. Reads were assembled using ALLPATHS-LG and fur-
ther scaffolded and gap-filled using in-house tools Atlas-Link (v.1.0) and Atlas 
GapFill (v.2.2) (https://www.hgsc.bcm.edu/software/)23. Atlas-link is a scaffolding 
or super-scaffolding method that uses all unused mate pairs to increase scaffold 
sizes and create new scaffolds in draft-quality assemblies. Those modified scaffolds 
are then ordered and oriented. Atlas GapFill is run on a super-scaffolded assembly. 
Regions with gaps are identified and reads mapping within or across those gaps 
are locally assembled using different assemblers (Phrap, Newbler and Velvet) in 
order to bridge the gaps with the most conservative assembly of previously unin-
corporated reads.
PBJelly (v.14.9.9) is a pipeline that improves the contiguity of draft assemblies 
by filling gaps, increasing contig sizes and super scaffolding by making use of 
long reads24. We used 12.3× 
 coverage of long Pacific Biosciences RSI and RS II 
sequences, along with the gap-filled Illumina read assembly, as input into PBJelly 
to produce the final C. atys hybrid Illumina–PacBio assembly. This assembly is 
available at NCBI as Caty1.0 (RefSeq accession GCF_000955945.1).
The total size of the assembled C. atys genome is around 2.85 Gb, with a contig 
N50 size of 112.9 kb and scaffold N50 size of 12.85 Mb (Table 1). By comparison, 
this contig N50 size is greater than equivalent values for 22 of the 26 other non-
human primate genome assemblies currently available. To assess completeness, 
we mapped 21,772 human protein-coding canonical transcripts to Caty_1.0 and 
found that 94.9% map to this C. atys genome with lengths of 95–100% (97.3% of 
transcripts map at length 70% or greater). As a more stringent test, we mapped 3023 
Benchmarking Universal Single-Copy Orthologues (BUSCO) genes and found 
that over 95% are present in Caty_1.0 (88.8% complete single copy and the others 
present but duplicated or fragmented)25.
Genome annotation was performed through the NCBI Genome Annotation 
Pipeline, which generated models for genes, transcripts and proteins26. To aid 
accurate transcript annotation, the NCBI pipeline incorporated RNA-seq data 
from a sooty mangabey pooled tissue reference sample, and data from 14 sepa-
rate tissues produced through a joint effort by the Nonhuman Primate Reference 
Transcriptome Resource (NHPRTR; http://www.nhprtr.org/)27 and the Human 
Genome Sequencing Center (HGSC) of Baylor College of Medicine. The NCBI 
process also used human RefSeq and GenBank transcripts along with other 
 
primate protein data.
Sequencing and polymorphism screen of 10 sooty mangabeys. DNA was pre-
pared from blood or liver samples from 10 sooty mangabeys from the YNPRC 
colony. Ten sooty mangabey breeder animals were selected in consultation with 
the YNPRC Breeding Manager representing at least 90% of colony diversity based 
on the pedigree of the colony. Illumina paired-end libraries (300-bp insert size) 
were prepared as described above for 500-bp paired-end libraries. These libraries 
were sequenced (100 bp reads) on a HiSeq2000 instrument, producing an average 
of 30× 
 whole-genome coverage across individuals. These reads were mapped to 
the C. atys assembly using BWA-mem and single-nucleotide variants were called 
using GATK (https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk/). A gVCF file was created 
for each animal, and variation in the regions of interest for TLR4 and ICAM2 were 
identified in those files.
Polymorphism screen among rhesus macaques. To assess variation in TRL4 and 
ICAM2 among rhesus macaques, we used our database of whole-genome sequence 
data from 133 individuals of this species. The details of sequencing and single- 
nucleotide variants discovery for this population have previously been described8. 
The population-level VCF file for this study was examined for relevant variation 
in these two genes.
Targeted re-sequencing of ICAM2 and TLR4 in rhesus macaques and sooty 
mangabeys. To test the validity of the apparent species differences in ICAM2 and 
TLR4 between rhesus macaques and sooty mangabeys, primers were designed 
to flank three areas of interest (see Extended Data Figs 3a, 5b), PCR was per-
formed using genomic DNA from two rhesus macaques and two sooty mangabeys 
(including FAK, the animal used for the Caty_1.0 reference genome) and the PCR 
product was subjected to Sanger sequencing. PCR primers were designed using 
Primer3 with default settings with the exception that the human mis-priming 
library was selected (http://bioinfo.ut.ee/primer3/)28,29. Primers were tailed with 
M13 sequences to facilitate Sanger sequencing.

AmpliTaq Gold 360 DNA Polymerase (Applied Biosystems) was used to amplify 
PCR products using the following protocol: 95 °C for 10 min; 95 °C for 30 s, 65 °C 
for 30 s, 72 °C for 30 s, 10 cycles (annealing temperature is decreased by 1 °C per 
cycle); 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 30 s, 30 cycles; 72 °C for 10 min. PCR 
products were subjected to Sanger sequencing (in both directions) using M13 
primers. PCR and Sanger sequencing was performed at ACGT. Traces (see Fig. 2a 
 
for examples) were inspected and consensus sequences obtained for each PCR 
product. Primer sequences were trimmed and consensus sequences were deposited 
in GenBank (accession numbers: MF468275–MF468286).
Sequencing and de novo assembly of RNA-seq transcripts. Transcripts for sooty 
mangabey were assembled de novo from RNA-seq reads using Trinity on XSEDE’s 
Blacklight supercomputer30. The RNA-seq reads were pooled from 12 different 
tissues and were prepared by the standard mRNA-seq with the uracil DNA gly-
cosylase protocol (Illumina kit Part RS-122-2303) and are publicly available from 
the Nonhuman Primate Reference Transcriptome Resource (NCBI SRA acces-
sion numbers SRX270666 and SRX270667)27. We performed a number of filtering 
steps to prepare threads for de novo assembly, which included removing adapters, 
 
filtering for quality, removing poly A/T tails and removing mtDNA and common 
mammalian rRNA27,31. After filtering, we used an input of 1,635,074,685 RNA-seq 
 
reads as the basis for the transcriptome assembly. Using around 550 mostly con-
tinuous compute hours on Blacklight, we partitioned the computational job into 
three phases described by the Trinity algorithm: Inchworm (around 100 h × 
 64 
cores), Chrysalis (around 400 h × 
 128 cores), and Quantify Graph and Butterfly 
(around 50 h × 64 cores). To circumvent the large amount of I/O generated in the 
Quantify Graph phase, we ran Trinity directly from the RAM disk for this phase. 
Using Trinity (version r2012-10-05), the following options were selected:
Trinity.pl–JM 512G–no_run_chrysalis–seqType fa–single, reads.fasta–run_as_
paired–CPU 16, Trinity.pl–JM 512G–no_run_quantifygraph–seqType fa–single, 
reads.fasta–run_as_paired–CPU 16–bflyGCThreads 4, Trinity.pl–JM 512G–no_
run_butterfly–seqType fa–single
reads.fasta–run_as_paired–CPU 16., Trinity.pl–JM 512G–bflyGCThreads 16–bfly-
CPU 32–seqType fa, –single reads.fasta–run_as_paired–CPU 16.
The large N25 (6,431 bp), N50 (3,483 bp) and N75 (1,116bp) values of the resulting 
assembly were indicative of its success.
Pipeline for finding divergent sooty mangabey proteins. C. atys assembly 
Caty_1.0 protein model predictions were screened against the curated M. mulatta 
MacaM protein models by alignment with BLASTp (v.2.2.28+ 
)22. The C. atys pro-
tein model alignment with the lowest e value or highest bitscore (for equal e values)

was selected for each MacaM protein model, yielding the set of orthologous C. atys 
protein predictions most similar to the M. mulatta protein models. The spliced 
CDS sequence for each Caty_1.0 transcript prediction was extracted with gffread 
(utility from cufflinks v.2.1.1). Caty_1.0 transcript prediction CDS sequences were 
screened against the de novo RNA-seq assembly transcript models by alignment 
with BLAT (v.34) and an aligment score was calculated as the number of matching 
 
bases minus the number of CDS sequence bases missing in alignment gaps 
 
normalized by the CDS sequence length.
This score penalizes bases missing from the CDS sequence without penalizing 
extra sequence that may have been added to the RNA-seq transcript model dur-
ing the assembly process. Only predicted CDS sequences that had a score > 
0.99 
were retained as supported by RNA-seq data. The MacaM best match selected 
Caty1.0 protein models were then cross-referenced with the RNA-seq supported 
Caty_1.0 transcript models to eliminate protein models without RNA-seq evidence. 
The protein alignments to MacaM for these models were then re-examined to 
find genes for which the alignment identity was less than 97%, where there were 
gaps in the alignments or the alignment was not the full length of the protein 
model. These two species share a common ancestor about 10–11 million years 
ago, and therefore the expectation is that most proteins will be > 
97% identical. 
This was confirmed by using a maximum likelihood amino acid model (WAG 
amino acid matrix) to estimate sequence distances between the C. atys and M. 
mulatta orthologues (Extended Data Fig. 1). Proteins of interest for differential 
response to lentivirus infection may be more divergent than expected on average. 
These represent potentially divergent genes and were further screened against the 
Gene Ontology (GO) term ‘immune response’
. This list of divergent immune genes 
was then further curated by manual inspection of multiple alignments of cDNA 
transcript and genomic sequences of C. atys (Caty_1.0), M. mulatta (MacaM) and 
human (GRCh38.p7). Multiple alignment analysis was performed using Multalin 
(http://multalin.toulouse.inra.fr/). TLR4 and ICAM2 sequence alignments were 
generated using Jalview.
Gene family evolution methods. In order to identify rapidly evolving gene families 
along the C. atys lineage, we obtained peptides from human, chimpanzee, orangu-
tan, gibbon, macaque, baboon, vervet, marmoset and mouse from ENSEMBL 8332. 
 
The C. atys peptides were obtained from NCBI33. To ensure that each gene was 
counted only once, we used only the longest isoform of each protein in each species. 
We then performed an all-versus-all BLAST search on these filtered sequences34. 
The resulting e values from the search were used as the main clustering crite-
rion for the MCL program to group peptides into gene families35. This resulted 
in 14,889 clusters. We then removed all clusters only present in a single species, 
resulting in 10,967 gene families. We also obtained an ultrametric tree from a pre-
vious study and added sooty mangabey based on its divergence time from baboon 
(TimeTree)36,37.
With the gene family data and ultrametric phylogeny as input, we estimated 
gene gain and loss rates (λ) with CAFE v.3.038. This version of CAFE is able to 
estimate the amount of assembly and annotation error (ε) present in the input data 
using a distribution across the observed gene family counts and a pseudo-likeli-
hood search. CAFE is then able to correct for this error and obtain a more accurate 
estimate of λ. We find an ε of about 0.04, which implies that 4% of gene families 
have observed counts that are not equal to their true counts. After correcting for 
this error rate, we find λ = 0.0020. These values for ε and λ are on par with those 
previously reported for mammalian datasets38,39 (Extended Data Table 3b). Using 
the estimated λ value, CAFE infers ancestral gene counts and calculates P values 
across the tree for each family and lineage to assess the significance of any gene 
family changes along a given branch. CAFE uses Monte Carlo re-sampling to assess 
if a given family is rapidly evolving. For those families found to be rapidly evolving 
(P < 
 0.01), it then calculates P values for each lineage within the family using the 
Viterbi method. Those lineages with low P values (P < 0.01) are said to be rapidly 
evolving.
We observed 1,561 rapidly evolving families across the 10 species of mammals 
sampled here. Extended Data Table 3c summarizes the gene family changes for all 
10 species. Humans have the highest average expansion rate across all families at 
0.20 whereas gibbons have the lowest at − 
0.09, meaning that they have the most 
gene family contractions. C. atys has undergone 535 gene family expansions of 
which 96 are rapid expansions and 340 gene family contractions of which 48 are 
rapid contractions.
Genetic distance between C. atys and M. mulatta orthologues. The amino acid 
sequences of 9,257 C. atys proteins with RNA-seq support (Fig. 1) were aligned 
to M. mulatta orthologues as described above. We then used the codeml pack-
age from PAML (v.4.9a) on each of these alignments with the WAG amino acid 
rate matrix to calculate maximum likelihood genetic distances between the two 
sequences40. A histogram was generated from these distances with R (Extended 
Data Fig. 1a).
TLR4 gene tree. TLR4 nucleotide sequences for 17 primate species were obtained 
from the NCBI GenBank resource (human: NM_138554.4; rhesus macaque: 
XM_015116960.1; sooty mangabey: manually curated XM_012091593.1; bon-
obo: NM_001279223.1; Nancy Ma’s night monkey: XM_012472756.2; drill: 
XM_011973281.1; colobus monkey: XM_011950060.1; crab-eating macaque: 
NM_001319615.1; squirrel monkey: XM_003925187.2; baboon: XM_003911309.4; 
pig-tailed macaque: NM_001305889.1; marmoset: XM_017975811.1; gorilla: 
XM_004048514.2; chimpanzee: NM_001144863.1; orangutan: AB445642.1; 
African green monkey: XM_007968248.1; gibbon: XM_003264057.3). These 
sequences were aligned with PASTA2 and we then constructed a maximum likeli-
hood gene tree with RAxML3, performing 100 bootstrap replicates41,42 (Extended 
Data Fig. 7). Finding low bootstrap support amongst nodes ancestral to sooty 
mangabey, drill and baboon, we counted the number of sites that were discordant 
with respect to the gene tree topology. That is, the number of sites in which baboon 
and C. atys share the same state and C. atys and drill share a different state with an 
outgroup species (one of the two other Old World monkeys).
Sample collection and processing. Peripheral blood samples from SIV-negative 
rhesus macaques and SIV-negative sooty mangabeys were collected by venipunc-
ture according to standard procedures at the Yerkes National Primate Research 
Center of Emory University and in accordance with US National Institutes of 
Health guidelines. Human blood samples were obtained from healthy donors at the 
Yerkes National Primate Research Center in accordance with Institutional Review 
Board protocol IRB0004582 and all relevant ethical regulations. Informed consent 
was obtained from all blood donors. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) 
were isolated from whole blood using Ficoll density-gradient centrifugation.
In vitro TLR-ligand stimulation assay. The assay used in this study is a modified 
version of the procedure previously described43. Ultrapure LPS (Escherichia coli 
0111:B4) and monophosphoryl lipid-A (Salmonella minnesota) were purchased 
from Invivogen. Whole blood collected in EDTA vacutainers was diluted 1:4 with 
RPMI 1640 medium and 195 μ 
l aliquots were transferred to 96-well, round-bottom 
micro-titre plates. Agonists were diluted in RPMI 1640 and 5 μ 
l were applied to 
the wells at the following final concentrations: LPS, 1,000–10 ng ml−1; lipid-A, 
10–1 μ 
g ml−1. Suspensions were then mixed by pipet and incubated at 37 ° C, 5% 
CO2 for 4 h). After incubation, plates were centrifuged at 700 r.p.m. for 10 min, 
and 120 μ 
l of cell-free supernatant was removed and stored at − 
80 °C until the 
assay was carried out. Each TLR ligand at a given concentration was performed 
in triplicate for each animal.
Cytokine bead array (CBA). Samples were obtained from sooty mangabeys and 
rhesus macaques housed at the YNPRC. Sooty mangabeys were naturally infected 
at the YNPRC and rhesus macaques had been infected previously with SIVsmm as 
previously described19. Supernatant levels of TNF and IL-6 were measured using 
the human inflammation CBA kit (BD Biosciences Immunocytometry Systems) 
according to the manufacturer’s instructions, with the modification that the sample 
volumes for supernatant, antibody-coupled bead mix and PE-conjugated detection 
 
antibody solution were all reduced to 25 μ 
l instead of 50 μ 
l44. After incubation, 
 
samples were washed with 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS, resuspended in 150 μ 
l 
 
PBS, and analysed using a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences 
Immunocytometry Systems). The average of triplicate cytokine measurements was 
used as the representative value for individual animals, and variations in cytokine 
levels between species groups were tested for statistical significance using unpaired 
t-tests in Prism 6.0. To quantify the level of TLR4 mRNA, and to perform linear 
regression of TLR-signalling molecules with TNF and IL6 cytokine levels, in the 
LPS-stimulated blood samples in the longitudinal SIVsmm-infected samples, we 
used microarray expression data from matched whole-blood samples; these data 
are available from the NCBI Geo database (accession GSE16147).
Plasma viral load measurement. Quantification of SIVsmm plasma viral RNA 
levels were quantified using qPCR as described previously45,46.
RNA-seq analysis of LPS-stimulated monocytes. RNA-seq analysis was con-
ducted at the Yerkes Nonhuman Primate Genomics Core Laboratory (http://www.
yerkes.emory.edu/nhp_genomics_core/). CD14+ monocytes were isolated from 
Ficoll-isolated PBMCs using CD14 MicroBeads according to the manufacturer’s 
instructions (Miltenyi Biotec). Subsequently, 0.4 × 
 106 cells were stimulated for 6 h 
with 10 ng ml−1 LPS and then immediately lysed in 350 μ 
l RLT buffer (Qiagen). 
RNA was purified using Micro RNEasy columns (Qiagen) and RNA quality was 
assessed using Agilent Bioanalyzer. Then, 10 ng of total RNA was used as input for 
mRNA amplification using 5′ 
 template-switch PCR with the Clontech SMART-
Seq v.4 Ultra Low Input RNA kit, according to the manufacturer’s instructions. 
Amplified mRNA was fragmented and appended with dual indexed barcodes 
using Illumina NexteraXT DNA Library Prep kits. Libraries were validated by 
capillary electrophoresis on an Agilent 4200 TapeStation, pooled and sequenced on 
an Illumina HiSeq 3000 using (100 bp paired-end reads) at an average read depth 
of 18 million. RNA-seq data were analysed by alignment and annotation to either

the MacaM v.7.8.2 assembly of the Indian rhesus macaque genome (available at 
https://www.unmc.edu/rhesusgenechip/index.htm) or to the Caty_1.0 assembly22. 
Alignment was performed using STAR v.2.5.2b using the annotation as a splice 
junction and abundance estimation reference, and non-unique mappings were 
removed from downstream analysis47. Transcripts were annotated using both the 
MacaM and Caty 1.0 assemblies and annotation as described in the text. Transcript 
abundance was estimated internally in STAR using the algorithm of HT-Seq and 
differential expression analyses were performed using the DESeq2 packages48,49. To 
quantitatively compare the degree to which LPS treatment induced inflammatory 
gene expression between species, we used GSEA50. GSEA was performed using the 
desktop module available from the Broad Institute (https://www.broadinstitute.
org/gsea/)51. Gene ranks for contrasts of LPS-treated versus untreated samples 
were calculated from the normalized expression tables using the signal-to-noise 
metric for each species separately. Ranked datasets contrasting LPS-treated ver-
sus untreated samples were tested for enrichment of the gene sets ‘HALLMARK_
TNFA_SIGNALING_VIA_NFKB’ (M5890) and ‘HALLMARK_IL6_JAK_ 
STAT3_SIGNALING’ (M5897) from the Molecular Signatures Database (http://
www.broadinstitute.org/gsea/msigdb/index.jsp) using gene set permutation to 
test for statistical significance. Heat maps and other visualizations were generated 
using Partek Genomics software, v.6.6.
ICAM2 exon splice junction analysis. RNA-seq alignments from all 24 LPS-
stimulated monocyte samples, and alignments derived from deep RNA-seq (over 
50 million reads) from two samples derived from flow-sorted, purified, blood 
 
C. atys conventional dendritic cells (cDCs, defined as CD3−CD14−CD20−CD123− 
HLA-DR+CD11c+) that were prepared alongside the monocytes were examined 
for observed splicing. To provide additional depth, we also included RNA-seq data 
from two flow-purified M. mulatta ‘non-classical’ monocyte samples (defined as 
CD14−CD16+HLA-DR+NKG2−CD3−CD20−) and one C. atys sample from CD4+ 
T transitional memory cells (CD4+ TTM, defined a 
s C 
D3 
+CD4+CD8−CD45RA−
CD95+CD28+CCR7highCD62L−CD14−CD16−CD20−). Reads from the alignment 
(BAM) files that mapped from 5 kb upstream to 5 kb downstream of the ICAM2 
loci were scanned by a custom Perl script that recorded evidence of splicing from 
the CIGAR field, and accumulated counts of reads supporting either splicing or 
read-through at each site. Splice site counts for all the samples were added together 
and compared to find the proportion of reads supporting each splice variant or 
intronic retention.
NF-κB luciferase reporter assay. Protein expressing constructs encoding human 
TLR4, MmTLR4, CaTLR4, MmTLR4 with the C terminus of CaTLR4, and CaTLR4 
with the C terminus of MmTLR4 were generated by the Emory Custom Cloning 
Core Division using standard cloning techniques. HEK293T were obtained from 
ATCC and regularly checked for mycoplasma contamination.
To determine the responsiveness of MmTLR-4 and CaTLR-4 to LPS, 
HEK293T cells were seeded in poly-l-lysine-coated 96-well plates and trans-
fected in triplicate using a standard calcium phosphate transfection protocol. 
Cells were co-transfected with expression plasmids of human MD-2 (pEFBOS, 
 
5 ng), human CD14 (pcDNA3, 5 ng) and different TLR-4 orthologues or 
 
chimaeras (pEF1a, 2.5 ng). The MD-2- and CD14-expression plasmids were 
provided by A. Medvedev; the NF-κ 
B reporter construct was made available 
by B. Baumann52,53. A firefly-luciferase reporter under the control of three 
NF-κ 
B-binding sites (100 ng) and a Gaussia luciferase reporter (5 ng) under the 
control of the pTAL promoter were co-transfected to monitor NF-κ 
B activity. 
The pTAL promoter construct contains a minimal TATA-like promoter (pTAL) 
region from the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (HSV-TK) promoter 
(Clontech) that is nonresponsive to NF-κ 
B and served as an internal control. To 
activate NF-κ 
B, cells were stimulated with 5 μ 
g ml−1 LPS (E. coli 026:B6, eBio-
science) for 5 h. After 40 h of transfection, a dual luciferase assay was performed 
and the firefly luciferase signals were normalized to the corresponding Gaussia 
luciferase control values.
qPCR. TLR stimulations of whole blood for qPCR were performed using the same 
method as for cytokine protein assay but scaled proportionally to use 1 ml of 
blood as input. Following stimulation, leukocytes were recovered by centrifuga-
tion at 700 r.p.m. for 5 min and removal of erythrocytes by incubation in ACK 
lysis buffer. Cells were lysed in 350 μ 
l of RLT buffer, and RNA purified using 
the RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. 
qPCR was performed on RNA as previously described54. Primers to cytokines 
for qPCR were designed using Primer Express software (Applied Biosystems) 
to regions of 100% nucleotide identity between M. mulatta and C. atys: 12S 
rRNA (endogenous standard) forward 5′

. Fold change was 
 
calculated by dividing the normalized post-treatment sample quantity with the 
normalized untreated control quantity from the same animal, and calculating the 
average of fold changes for each species.
Flow cytometry of PBMCs. Multicolour flow cytometry staining was performed 
using the following antibodies and reagents: CD3–APC/Cy7 (SP34-2), CD14–PE/ 
Cy7 (M5E2) and CD20–PE/Cy5 (2H7) from BD; CD4–BV650 (OKT4), 
 
CD8–BV711 (RPA-T8), ICAM-2–FITC (CBR-IC2/2), Mouse IgG2a(κ 
)–FITC 
(MOPC-173) isotype control from Biolegend; Live/Dead Fixable Aqua from 
Thermo Fisher Scientific. Cells were stained for flow cytometry and data were 
acquired on an LSR II cytometer (BD) and analysed by FlowJo 10 software 
(TreeStar). Further analyses were performed using PRISM (GraphPad) and Excel 
(Microsoft Office 2011) software.
ICAM-2 western blot. PBMCs were lysed in RIPA buffer and equal amounts of 
cell lysate were boiled after addition of sample buffer including β 
-mercaptoethanol, 
resolved with a 4–15% SDS–PAGE (Bio-Rad), and proteins were transferred to an 
Immobilon-P PVDF membrane (Millipore). Afterwards membranes were blocked 
for 1 h in blocking buffer (Bio-Rad) and incubated overnight with polyclonal rabbit 
ICAM-2-specific antibody (Bethyl). After washing (PBS with 0.05% Tween-20), 
anti-rabbit HRP-conjugated secondary antibody was incubated for an additional 
1 h, washed, and HRP activity was determined using the Super Signal West Pico Kit 
(Bio-Rad and visualized using the ChemiDoc XRS+ 
 (Bio-Rad). Then the mem-
brane was stripped with buffer (2% SDS, 0.5 M Tris, pH 2.2), blocked again and 
 
β 
-actin was detected using a rabbit anti-β 
-actin antibody as primary antibody and 
anti-rabbit-HRP antibody as secondary antibody.
Statistical analysis. Statistical significance was determined using an unpaired 
Student’s t-test with Welch’s correction. P < 
 0.05 was considered significant. 
 
* 
P < 
 0.05; * 
* 
P < 
 0.01; NS, not significant. Data are mean ± 
 s.d. or s.e.m. as indi-
cated. Significance for comparisons of mRNA levels of individual genes in RNA-seq 
data was tested using the Wald test as part of the DESeq2 workflow. Bars represent 
group means, and dots represent read counts for individual samples normalized to 
library size. P values denoted are adjusted using Benjamini–Hochberg correction.

topology corresponds to the accepted species relationships for Old World 
monkeys. However, low bootstrap support among the nodes ancestral to 
C. atys, drill and baboon indicate that several sites within the gene do not 
support that ordering and may be indicative of incomplete lineage sorting.

Life Sciences Reporting Summary
Nature Research wishes to improve the reproducibility of the work that we publish. This form is intended for publication with all accepted life 
science papers and provides structure for consistency and transparency in reporting. Every life science submission will use this form; some list 
items might not apply to an individual manuscript, but all fields must be completed for clarity. 
For further information on the points included in this form, see Reporting Life Sciences Research. For further information on Nature Research 
policies, including our data availability policy, see Authors & Referees and the Editorial Policy Checklist. 
�    Experimental design
1. Sample size
Describe how sample size was determined.
The primary data reported in this study is the DNA genome sequence of a monkey 
species, the Sooty Mangabey. The animal selected for sequencing was one of the 
original dams of a large matrilineal line of the colony. In addition, she possessed 
the most common MHC haplotype observed within the group. As such, her genetic 
constitution within the closed population was thought to be most representative of 
any single animal. To verify sequencing findings and estimate population 
penetrance of alleles, we sequenced the genome of 10 additional animals - these 
animals were selected as they collectively represented 76% of the offspring of the 
Yerkes National Primate Research colony. 
For RNA-Seq, and microarray  we used a power calculation performed on a model 
set of rhesus macaques in which RNA expression at different effect sizes (fold-
changes) gave us an estimate of our sensitivity to detect changes to approximately 
1.5 fold. For LPS stimulation studies, as the effect sizes (species differences) were 
much larger than most gene expression differences based on pilot stimulations, we 
also used this power calculation dataset. 
2. Data exclusions
Describe any data exclusions.
To identify novel immunogenetic factors specific for SMs that may be involved in 
their ability to avoid progression to AIDS, we established a bioinformatic pipeline 
for a comparative protein analysis. During this process we excluded proteins based 
on certain criteria:The SM protein model alignment with the lowest e-value or 
highest bitscore (for equal e-values) was selected for each MacaM protein model, 
yielding the set of orthologous SM protein predictions most like the rhesus protein 
models. SM CDS sequences were screened against the de novo RNA-seq assembly 
transcript models by alignment with blat  and an aligment score was calculated as 
the number of matching bases reduced by the number of CDS sequence bases 
missing in alignment gaps normalized by the CDS sequence length. This score 
penalizes bases missing from the CDS sequence without penalizing extra sequence 
that may have been added to the RNA-seq transcript model during the assembly 
process. We then excluded SM protein sequences that are not supported by the 
RNA-seq data (<99 % matching sequence), thereby eliminating those that had been 
incorrectly identified as divergent from rhesus macaque due to errors in transcript 
or protein models. We also excluded 6,906 SM protein models with more than 97% 
identity with rhesus orthologs  from further analysis. Proteins of interest for 
differential response to lentivirus infection may be more divergent than expected 
on average. We thus filtered the remaining divergent SM proteins (i.e. those with 
less than 97% identity) that have high sequence confidence using the GO term 
“immune response,” which after manual inspection resulted in a list of 34 
candidate immune-related genes that are sequence divergent between SMs and 
rhesus macaques (Table 2, Extended data table 1).  
Sequencing and de novo assembly of RNA-seq transcripts required a number of 
filtering steps to prepare threads for de novo assembly which included removing 
adapters, filtering for quality, removing poly A/T tails, and removing mtDNA and 
common mammalian rRNA.

3. Replication
Describe whether the experimental findings were
reliably reproduced.
We reproduced experimental findings in the following manner: 
1. To validate our findings of sequence divergence in the sooty mangabey genome,
we performed full genome sequencing of an additional 10 animals. We also
conducted Sanger sequencing of genomic DNA of genes of interest, and used
available RNA-Seq data to verify the sequence data.
2. For the LPS stimulation data, we performed LPS stimulation of 9 RMs and 8 SMs
-over three separate experiment days, using multiple dosages. Each data point
shown represents the average of three technical replicates per animal. We
repeated the LPS experiment in SIV-infected SMs (n = 5) and RMs (n = 4). The
finding of reduced TNFa and IL6  cytokine release was measured by protein-based
quantiation (CBA), by real-time PCR for RNA levels, and by RNA-Seq - with the
observation of reduced production consistent across the different assays.
We did not observe a failure to reliably produce our findings.
4. Randomization
Describe how samples/organisms/participants were
allocated into experimental groups.
Where possible samples were run in single batches using equal numbers of 
samples from species compared (i.e. rhesus macaque and sooty mangabey), thus 
they were balanced. For the in vivo SIV infection experiment, groups were divided 
3 SM +2 RMs for processing group 1 and 2 SMs and 3 RMs for processing group 2. 
For the cyokine bead array experiments, ICAM2 surface expression measurments, 
multiple batches were measured over several days - to minimize batch effects, we 
would run 3-5 individuals from each species, with an equal number of RM and SM 
individuals run in a single batch, all samples for a given individual animal (ie. Time 
points or stimuli doses) were assayed together. For RNA-Seq processing, samples 
were run in a single batch for all processing steps, and for sequencing, bar-coded 
cDNA fragments from all samples were pooled and split evenly across multiple 
lanes to reduce lane bias.
5. Blinding
Describe whether the investigators were blinded to
group allocation during data collection and/or analysis.
Blinding was incorporated for RNA-seq and microarray analysis by assigning 
samples de-identified inventory codes prior to submission for processing in which 
no information about individual, species or treatment condition was provided. 
Note: all studies involving animals and/or human research participants must disclose whether blinding and randomization were used.
6. Statistical parameters
