Abstract: Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is a rare, but aggressive cancer. Surgery 
and radiation offer limited benefit, and systemic chemotherapy remains the primary treatment 
modality for the majority of patients. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and its receptor 
have been recognized as important players in the biology of this disease. Bevacizumab is a 
monoclonal antibody that binds VEGF and blocks its interaction with the VEGF receptor. Recent 
studies have shown benefit with the addition of bevacizumab to the combination of cisplatin and 
pemetrexed in MPM. This combination is now included in the National Comprehensive Cancer 
Network guidelines (with a category 2A recommendation) as a possible first-line treatment 
for unresectable MPM in appropriately selected patients. This review discusses the rationale 
behind the use of bevacizumab in MPM, as well as summarizes the pharmacology, efficacy, 
safety, and toxicity of bevacizumab across multiple trials. The use of small-molecule inhibitors 
of angiogenesis in the treatment of MPM is also discussed.
Keywords: angiogenesis, monoclonal antibody, VEGF
Introduction
Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is a rare, but aggressive cancer of the 
mesothelial surface of the pleural cavity, which has been linked to occupational 
exposure to asbestos. It accounts for the vast majority of cases of mesothelioma, with 
peritoneal and pericardial mesothelioma making up the remainder. Worldwide, the 
mortality from mesothelioma is reported as five people per million, with the largest 
number of reported deaths occurring in the USA.1 There are three recognized histologic 
subtypes, epithelioid, sarcomatoid, and mixed with epithelioid histology conferring 
a better prognosis. The prevalence is higher in males with a median age at diagnosis 
of 72 years. Patients typically present with signs and symptoms of a pleural effusion, 
notably chest pain and dyspnea. Systemic symptoms such as fatigue, weight loss, and 
fever are also common.
Management of MPM includes surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy. The role of 
surgery in MPM is controversial. Unlike non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), which 
has a well-defined anatomic site in the lung parenchyma, mesothelioma originates from 
the pleura, which surrounds the whole lung cavity and intrathoracic organs, therefore 
making a complete (R0) resection impossible. There are two techniques that have been 
traditionally used, pleurectomy/decortication, which includes removal of the involved 
pleura and all gross disease, but sparing the lung, and extrapleural pneumonectomy 
(EPP), which involves en bloc removal of the pleura, lung, ipsilateral diaphragm,

and pericardium. Although EPP offers a better theoretical 
chance of complete disease resection, it is also associated 
with higher perioperative morbidity and mortality. Studies 
thus far have failed to demonstrate a survival advantage with 
EPP. Retrospective studies have shown seemingly improved 
survival after surgery, as compared to historical controls, 
but have been heavily skewed toward more fit patients with 
a better performance status and surgically more localized/
favorable disease.2 The current guidelines agree that patients 
with higher risk disease, such as sarcomatoid or mixed his-
tology, or mediastinal lymph node involvement, derive little 
benefit from a surgical approach and should be treated with 
systemic chemotherapy only.3 The decision on surgical inter-
vention in fit patients with lower risk disease is usually made 
based on the institutional preference and surgical expertise. 
The role of radiation in pleural mesothelioma is limited as 
well. As a monotherapy, it does not offer a survival advantage 
and has been primarily used for palliative purposes with the 
goal of pain relief in areas of symptomatic disease. Although 
the rate of surgical intervention in MPM varies from 20% in 
the community setting to 40% in tertiary centers, the majority 
of patients receive systemic chemotherapy as their primary 
treatment modality.4,5
Single-agent chemotherapy has shown limited efficacy in 
MPM, with disappointing response rates (RRs) of ,20%. The 
first chemotherapy combination of cisplatin and pemetrexed 
was approved in 2004, based on a randomized Phase III trial 
comparing the combination of cisplatin and pemetrexed 
to cisplatin monotherapy in untreated inoperable patients.6 
The combination arm achieved an almost 3-month improve-
ment in median overall survival (OS; 12.1 vs 9.3 months, 
P=0.02) as well as 1.8 months improvement in median time-
to-progression (TTP; 5.7 vs 3.9 months, P=0.001) and a sig-
nificantly superior tumor RR (41.3% vs 16.6%, P,0.0001). 
The combination remains the only National Comprehensive 
Center Network category 1 recommendation for patients 
with MPM who can tolerate both drugs. For patients who are 
unable to tolerate cisplatin, the combination of carboplatin 
and pemetrexed has shown similar outcomes in Phase II 
trials, with median OS of 12–14 months.7–9 The combination 
of gemcitabine and cisplatin has also been investigated in 
Phase II trials, and may be a reasonable option for patients 
who are unable to tolerate pemetrexed.
Angiogenesis
Angiogenesis is the process of formation and maintenance 
of new blood vessels. It is essential for tissue viability and 
growth, and plays an important role in wound healing as well 
as cancer proliferation. A variety of signaling proteins have 
been implicated in the regulation of this process. Among 
these, the interaction of vascular endothelial growth factor 
(VEGF) with its receptor (VEGFR) stands out as one of the 
main drivers of vasculogenesis, the formation of blood ves-
sels from precursor cells during embryogenesis, and angio-
genesis, the formation of blood vessels from the division of 
preexisting endothelial cells.
veGF family
The VEGF family includes three receptors (VEGFR-1, 
VEGFR-2, and VEGFR-3) and five ligands (VEGF-A, 
VEGF-B, VEGF-C, VEGF-D, and placental growth 
factor). VEGFR-1, also known as FMS-related tyrosine 
kinase 1 (Flt1), has very weak tyrosine kinase activity, and 
although it binds to VEGF-A, VEGF-B, and placental growth 
factor tightly, it appears to serve more as a decoy receptor. 
VEGFR-2, also known as kinase insert domain receptor, 
is the main regulator of angiogenesis and is activated by 
VEGF-A. VEGFR-3 is primarily involved in the regulation of 
lymphogenesis and interacts with VEGF-C and VEGF-D.10
The importance of VEGF-A in angiogenesis is under-
scored by the fact that even one mutant allele for this protein 
is embryonically lethal in mice. Due to alternative splicing, 
VEGF-A has multiple isoforms, with peptide lengths of 
121, 165, 189, and 206 amino acids. They differ by the basic 
stretch in the carboxyl terminus, which allows the peptides 
to have a different degree of binding to heparin/heparan 
sulfate and neuropilin-1, a coreceptor for VEGF-A. Among 
the above subtypes, the 165 amino acid peptide is quanti-
tatively and qualitatively the most active. Reintroduction 
of VEGF-A165 is able to rescue the embryo of the VEGF-A 
knock-out mouse.10
Angiogenesis in pleural mesothelioma
Angiogenesis plays an important role in malignant meso-
thelioma. In preclinical studies, intraperitoneal injection of 
crocidolite asbestos fibers was found to cause development 
of peritoneal mesothelioma in mice after 30–50 weeks. 
However, formation of new blood vessels surrounding 
the implanted fibers was noted at 2 weeks after injection, 
implicating angiogenesis as one of the earliest events in 
mesothelioma.11 Moreover, several studies have shown that 
mesothelioma cell lines, as compared to the normal meso-
thelial cells and fibroblasts, produce high amounts of proan-
giogenic factors, including VEGF. Mesothelioma cells also 
express VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2 and respond to VEGF in 
the environment by increasing cell proliferation. In addition,

Bevacizumab in pleural mesothelioma
blocking the VEGFRs with a monoclonal antibody inhibits 
mesothelioma cell growth. This implicates VEGF as not only 
a promoter of angiogenesis, but also an autocrine growth 
factor for mesothelioma cells.
An analysis of mesothelioma tumor samples from patients as 
compared to non-neoplastic mesothelium revealed an increased 
expression of multiple proangiogenic cytokines, including 
VEGF (81% vs 20%) and fibrocyte growth factor (FGF)-1 
(67% vs 50%) and FGF-2 (92% vs 40%).12 The expression of 
angiogenic cytokines also correlated with increased intratu-
moral microvessel density and worse patient survival.12,13 In 
addition, the expression of VEGF receptors has been confirmed 
in patient mesothelioma samples and varies between 20% and 
70%, depending on the receptor subtype.14,15
Targeting angiogenesis
The idea to target angiogenesis as a means of controlling 
tumor growth was first proposed by Dr Judah Folkman 
in the 1970s. It came to fruition in 2004 with the United 
States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of a 
monoclonal antibody against VEGF-A, bevacizumab. Since 
then, a variety of antiangiogenic molecules and peptides 
have been developed, including tyrosine kinase inhibitors, 
such as sorafenib, sunitinib, pazopanib, axitinib, vandetanib, 
regorafenib, and lenvatinib, all of which target VEGFR-2 
among other tyrosine kinases with different degrees of selec-
tivity.16 Other small-molecule inhibitors of VEGFR-2 are 
still in development and include promising molecules such 
as cediranib. An antibody against VEGFR-2, ramucirumab, 
has been developed and approved for use in metastatic gas-
tric, colorectal, and NSCLCs. In addition, a decoy receptor, 
aflibercept, was made by fusion of VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2 
binding domains to the Fc portion of immunoglobulin and 
is approved for use in combination with chemotherapy in 
metastatic colorectal cancer. The different mechanisms of 
VEGF inhibition are depicted in Figure 1.
Bevacizumab
Bevacizumab is a recombinant humanized monoclonal 
immunoglobulin antibody against VEGF-A ligand. It was 
created in 1997 when the complement determining region of 
murine anti-VEGF antibody (Mab A.4.6.1) was transferred to 
the human framework. This reduced antibody–VEGF binding 
1,000-fold, compared to the original murine antibody. Further

Notes: veGF is expressed by MPM cells and binds veGFR. veGFR activity increases MPM cell proliferation and together with other receptors, such as PDGFR and FGFR, 
controls angiogenesis. Bevacizumab binds to veGF and prevents veGFR activation. A number of small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors block veGFR activity as well as the 
activity of other receptors such as PDGFR and FGFR.

replacement of seven amino acids in the non-complement 
determining region was required to improve VEGF binding 
(Kd =1.1 nM), approximating binding of the original anti-
body. The final product contains 93% human and 7% murine 
sequences. Bevacizumab binds and neutralizes all biologi-
cally active isoforms of VEGF-A, including its bioactive 
proteolytic fragments. It sterically prevents binding and 
activation of VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2 on the surface of the 
cells. However, it does not bind or inhibit other angiogenic 
cytokines, including VEGF-B, VEGF-C, and FGF.
Pharmacokinetics of bevacizumab
The pharmacokinetics of bevacizumab was studied in a 
Phase I trial, in which patients received bevacizumab at 
0.1–10 mg/kg on days 0, 28, 35, and 42. Antibody clearance 
followed a fairly linear pattern with a half-life of 21 days, 
which is similar to other antibodies with the same backbone. 
The drug distribution was primarily intravascular, with 
undetectable serum VEGF achieved at doses as low as 
0.3 mg/kg.17
Bevacizumab safety and toxicity
In a Phase I study, escalating doses of bevacizumab up to 
10 mg/kg did not achieve dose-limiting toxicity, which was 
defined as grade 3 toxicity or higher (biologic response 
modifier-adjusted common toxicity criteria) occurring in 
two patients in a given cohort.17 The reported side effects 
were grade 1–2 headache, nausea, asthenia, and fever, which 
occurred in fewer than 20% of patients. No grade 3 or 4 liver, 
renal, or cardiac toxicity was noted. Grade 3–4 intracranial 
bleeding in a patient with central nervous system metastases 
and intratumoral hemorrhage in a patient with sarcoma were 
seen, both of which were attributed to the important role of 
VEGF in the maintenance of vascular integrity.
Subsequent Phase II and III trials continued to demon-
strate a risk of bleeding with bevacizumab, varying from 
grade 1–2 epistaxis (the most common, ~35%) to clinically 
significant, sometimes fatal gastrointestinal, pulmonary, 
and intracranial bleeding with a cumulative incidence of 
grade 3–4 hemorrhage across trials of 1.2%–4.6%.18 In 
squamous cell carcinoma of the lung, use of bevacizumab 
is associated with 31% incidence of significant pulmonary 
hemorrhage and is currently contraindicated.19
Venous thromboembolic events (VTE) have also been 
reported in patients receiving bevacizumab and chemo-
therapy. The rates of VTE vary considerably, depending on 
the chemotherapy used and the malignancy being treated. 
A 2011 pooled analysis of Phase II and III trials of patients 
receiving chemotherapy and bevacizumab reported rates of 
VTE of 10.9% with bevacizumab versus 9.8% in controls 
(odds ratio, 1.14; 95% confidence interval: 0.96–1.35; 
P=0.13), suggesting that there is no increased risk of VTE 
in patients receiving bevacizumab.20
Other side effects include an increased incidence of 
arterial thrombotic events in patients over 65 years of age 
(5.7% grade $3 events as compared to 2.6% in the control 
arm) and hypertension (grade $3 in 15% as compared to 
4% in the control arm).21 VEGF signaling utilizes the nitric 
oxide (NO) pathway, among others. Therefore, inhibition of 
VEGF-mediated signaling causes a decrease in NO-mediated 
signaling, resulting in arterial vasoconstriction and resultant 
hypertension. NO also plays a role in platelet aggregation, 
which is thought to be the mechanism behind the increased 
arterial thrombotic events associated with bevacizumab.
VEGF also regulates glomerular vascular perme-
ability, which explains bevacizumab-associated proteinuria 
(grade $3 incidence is 0.7%–7.4%). The administration of 
bevacizumab warrants periodic monitoring of urine protein 
excretion and temporary suspension of bevacizumab if pro-
teinuria exceeds 2 g in 24 h.22–25
Angiogenesis and neovascularization are important 
processes in wound healing and tissue repair. Consequently, 
there is a concern for bevacizumab-associated impairment of 
wound healing. The FDA approved drug label recommends 
suspension of bevacizumab treatment for 28 days before and 
after any surgical intervention.18 The incidence of wound heal-
ing complications following colorectal surgery was reported 
to be 15% in patients treated with bevacizumab, as compared 
to 4% in the control group.24
Other well-known adverse reactions to bevacizumab 
include gastrointestinal perforation (0.3%–2.4%), fistula 
formation (,0.3%), reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy 
(,0.1%), congestive heart failure (5% incidence; increased 
in patients concurrently treated with taxanes or with previous 
exposure to anthracyclines), ovarian failure (34% in bevaci-
zumab arm as compared to 2% in the control arm; reversible 
with bevacizumab discontinuation in 22% of patients), and 
infusion reactions (severe reactions in ,0.2% of patients).18
Bevacizumab in non-mesothelioma solid malignancies
At this time, bevacizumab is approved for use in the 
metastatic setting with chemotherapy for multiple tumor 
types, including cervical, colorectal, NSCLC (nonsquamous 
histology), ovarian, fallopian tube, primary peritoneal, and 
renal cell carcinomas. Bevacizumab as a monotherapy is also 
approved for the treatment of refractory glioblastoma.18

Bevacizumab in pleural mesothelioma
Bevacizumab in combination with 
chemotherapy in MPM
Bevacizumab was first evaluated in MPM in combination 
with erlotinib in a Phase II trial in MPM patients who were 
previously treated with systemic chemotherapy.26 Patients 
received erlotinib 150 mg daily and bevacizumab 15 mg/m2 
every 21 days. Although there were no complete responses 
(CRs) or partial responses (PRs), 12 out of 24 patients 
achieved stable disease (SD) at least for two cycles. The 
median TTP was 2.2 months and the median OS was 
5.8 months from the time of initiation of treatment. The 
trial did not achieve its primary endpoint (two objective 
responses) and was not continued further. The efficacy and 
toxicity of bevacizumab-based combinations across trials in 
MPM are summarized in Tables 1 and 2, respectively.
The first randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled 
Phase II trial evaluating the role of bevacizumab in combina-
tion with cytotoxic chemotherapy in MPM in the first-line 
setting was published in 2012.27 In this trial, patients were 
treated with gemcitabine (1,250 mg/m2 on days 1 and 8), cis-
platin (75 mg/m2 on day 1), and bevacizumab (15 mg/m2 on 
day 1) or placebo every 21 days. One hundred fifteen patients 
were enrolled at 11 different sites. No difference in tumor 
RR (24.5% vs 21.8%), progression-free survival (PFS; 6.9 vs 
6.0 months, P=0.88), or OS (15.6 vs 14.7 months, P=0.91) 
was noted between the bevacizumab and placebo arms, 
respectively. Pretreatment plasma VEGF levels were also 
analyzed, and although there was no difference between 
responders and nonresponders, a higher baseline plasma 
VEGF level was associated with a worse PFS and OS.
The observed lack of efficacy of bevacizumab in com-
bination with gemcitabine/cisplatin backbone may, in part, 
be attributed to a negative interaction between gemcitabine 
and bevacizumab. As was pointed out by the authors 
of the study, preclinical studies have demonstrated that 
some of the chemotherapy drugs (such as the taxanes and 
5-flurouracil) induce angiogenesis by mobilization of circu-
lating endothelial cells.28 This effect counteracts the antitu-
mor activity of chemotherapy and is blocked by anti-VEGF 
antibodies. Gemcitabine and cisplatin do not increase the 
number of circulating endothelial cells. Consistent with the 
above data, anti-VEGF therapy enhanced antitumor activity 
of taxanes, but had no effect when added to gemcitabine in 
a mouse model of lung cancer.
Bevacizumab was also evaluated in combination with 
carboplatin and pemetrexed in a Phase II trial in patients 
with unresectable MPM in the first-line setting.29 Patients 
were treated for a maximum of six cycles or until progressive

disease (PD) and, in the absence of PD, were continued on 
maintenance bevacizumab for a maximum of 1 year. Out 
of 76 evaluable patients, response was seen in 34.2%, all 
of whom had either epithelioid or mixed histology MPM. 
SD was seen in 57.9% of patients, with an overall disease 
control rate of 92.1%. The median duration of response was 
8 months. The median PFS was 6.9 months and the median 
OS was 15.3 months, with 1- and 2-year survivals of 62.6% 
and 25.9%, respectively. The study failed to achieve its pri-
mary endpoint of 50% improvement in PFS, compared to the 
standard pemetrexed/platinum combination.29
Dowell et al investigated the combination of cisplatin, 
pemetrexed, 
and 
bevacizumab 
in 
53 
patients 
with 
chemotherapy-
naïve unresectable malignant pleural and peritoneal meso-
thelioma in a Phase II trial.30 The combination was relatively 
well tolerated, with the primary grade 3–4 toxicities being 
neutropenia (11%), grade 3 hypertension (6%), and venous 
thromboembolism (all grades) (13%). PR and SD were noted 
in 40% and 35% of patients, respectively. The 6-month 
PFS rate was 56%, and the median OS was 14.8 months. 
Unfortunately, the trial failed to meet its primary endpoint 
of a 33% improvement in the PFS rate at 6 months, as com-
pared with the historical control of cisplatin and pemetrexed 
alone.30 In an unplanned post hoc analysis restricted to 44 
patients with MPM, the PFS rate at 6 months was 52%, and 
an objective tumor RR of 35% and a median OS of 14.1 
months were observed.
The role of bevacizumab in MPM was further evaluated 
in the French Mesothelioma Avastin Cisplatin Pemetrexed 
Study (MAPS).31 The trial was started as a Phase II study 
that evaluated the disease control rate at 6 months (primary 
endpoint) and safety (secondary endpoint) with the addition 
of bevacizumab to cisplatin and pemetrexed. The Phase II 
portion of the trial met its goal with a 6-month disease control 
rate achieved in 27 out of 47 patients (57%) as was evalu-
ated by an expert panel masked to the randomization. The 
trial was expanded to a multicenter, randomized, controlled, 
open-label Phase III study. Four hundred forty-eight che-
motherapy-naïve patients with surgically inoperable MPM 
were randomized to receive cisplatin and pemetrexed (PC) 
vs PC with addition of bevacizumab (PCB). Eligible patients 
had biopsy-proven MPM that was not amenable to curative 
intent surgery, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group 
(ECOG) performance status of 0–2, and adequate renal, 
hepatic, and bone marrow function. Patients were excluded 
based on the presence of central nervous system metastases, 
predisposition to bleeding (including hemoptysis, inherited 
coagulopathy, bleeding diathesis), use of antiplatelet agents 
(aspirin, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, clopidogrel, 
ticlopidine, or dipyridamole), or patients on therapeutic 
doses of anticoagulation (low-molecular-weight heparin 
or a vitamin K antagonist). Patients were also excluded for 
uncontrolled hypertension, major surgery within 28 days 
of enrollment, recent myocardial infarction or cerebral 
vascular accident (within 6 months), uncontrolled ischemic 
cardiomyopathy, congestive heart failure, cardiac arrhyth-
mia, recent gastrointestinal perforation (within 6 months), 
or fistula. Patients completed a maximum of six cycles of 
cisplatin and pemetrexed in both PC and PCB arms. After 
six cycles of chemotherapy, the PCB group was allowed 
to continue with bevacizumab maintenance every 3 weeks 
until PD or limiting toxicity. Patients experiencing $ grade 2 
renal toxicity from cisplatin could be changed to carboplatin 
(area under the curve 5). Tumor response assessments were 
performed after every three cycles of treatment. The primary 
outcome was median OS, and patients were stratified by 
mesothelioma histology, performance status, and smoking 
history. The study was designed to have an 80% power to 
detect an improvement in median OS from 13 months in the 
control arm to 17.3 months in the experimental arm.
Seventy-five percent of patients enrolled were male, 
97% had an ECOG performance status of 0 or 1, and 81% 
had epithelioid histology. After a median follow-up of 
39.4 months, patients who received PCB were noted to have 
a statistically significant improvement in median PFS (9.2 vs 
7.3 months; adjusted hazard ratio [HR] =0.61; P,0.0001) 
and median OS (18.8 vs 16.1 months; adjusted HR =0.75; 
P=0.0167), as compared to patients who received PC. The 
PFS and OS observed in the control arm of this trial were 
superior to those seen in the pivotal trial of cisplatin and 
pemetrexed by Vogelzang et al.6 This was likely due to the 
strict inclusion criteria required for enrollment, such as the 
exclusion of patients with cardiovascular comorbidities. 
 
A preplanned exploratory analysis noted that the baseline 
serum concentration of VEGF was prognostic of worse out-
come, although not predictive of response to bevacizumab. 
As expected, the incidence of VEGF-related adverse events 
was significantly higher in PCB group as compared to PC 
group, specifically grade 3 and 4 hypertension (23% vs 0%), 
cardiovascular events (28.8% vs 0.9%), and arterial and 
venous thromboembolic events (5.8% vs 0.9%), respectively. 
Bevacizumab-treated patients also experienced a higher 
incidence of grade 1–2 hemorrhage (epistaxis) and serum 
creatinine elevation. There was no significant difference in 
other hematologic and nonhematologic toxicities, including 
the incidence of febrile neutropenia, fatigue, nausea, and

Bevacizumab in pleural mesothelioma
vomiting. More patients in the PCB arm stopped first-line 
treatment due to toxicity than in PC arm (24.3% vs 13%, 
respectively). Nevertheless, the reported quality of life scores 
worsened for activity-related items (PC 52% vs PCB 37%) 
and general condition items (PC 48% vs PCB 36%) more 
commonly in the group that did not receive bevacizumab. 
The quality-of-life data need to be interpreted with caution 
due to low rate of questionnaire completion (50%–70%) and 
possible reporting bias in this open-label study.
Small-molecule inhibitors of veGFR in 
pleural mesothelioma
In addition to antibody-mediated interference with the 
VEGF–VEGFR interaction, as seen with bevacizumab, 
small-molecule inhibitors of VEGFR signaling have also 
been explored in MPM.
Sunitinib
Sunitinib is an oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor of VEGFR, 
platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR), FMS-
related tyrosine kinase 3 (Flt3), and c-Kit tyrosine kinase 
(c-Kit). It is currently FDA approved for use in gastrointes-
tinal stroma tumors and renal cell carcinoma. It was studied 
in a Phase II trial in patients with unresectable MPM, whose 
disease had shown progression on a platinum-based, antime-
tabolite (pemetrexed or gemcitabine)-containing regimen.32 
Out of 53 enrolled patients, 6 patients (12%) had a PR and 
34 patients (65%) had SD. There were no CRs. The median 
TTP was 3.5 months, and the median OS from treatment 
initiation was 6.1 months. The most common grade 3–4 
toxicities were fatigue (30%), thrombocytopenia (9%), and 
neutropenia (7%). One patient experienced grade 3 cardiac 
toxicity, which was attributed to sunitinib.
A combination of sunitinib together with cytotoxic 
chemotherapy (cisplatin and pemetrexed) was attempted in 
a Phase I trial in patients with NSCLC and one patient with 
mesothelioma. Although the patient with mesothelioma 
achieved a PR, the combination was not well tolerated due 
to prohibitive myelosuppression.33
Sorafenib
Sorafenib is a potent tyrosine kinase inhibitor of the Raf tyrosine 
kinase/mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway with 
additional activity against VEGFR-1, VEGFR-2, VEGFR-3, 
PDGFR-β, FGF receptor 1 (FGFR-1), Flt3, and c-Kit. It is FDA 
approved for use in renal cell and hepatocellular carcinomas. 
In 2010, a Phase II trial examined the activity of sorafenib in 
patients with MPM. Sixty percent of enrolled patients had been 
previously treated with one line of pemetrexed-based chemo-
therapy.34 Among 50 patients, only 3 (6%) achieved a PR, 27 
patients (54%) had SD, with the remaining patients showing 
disease progression (PD). The median duration of response/SD 
was 7.9 months, with some patients achieving ongoing long-
term stability for 40 months at the time of study completion. In 
the chemotherapy-naïve population, a 10% PR was observed.
Another single-arm Phase II trial of sorafenib was con-
ducted in patients previously treated with pemetrexed-based 
chemotherapy and demonstrated similar efficacy. Fifty-three 
patients were enrolled, with 3 patients (6%) achieving a PR 
and 30 patients (56%) having SD at 8 months. The median PFS 
and OS were 5.1 and 9 months, respectively, and 9% of patients 
were still receiving the drug after 1 year of treatment.35
Cediranib
Cediranib is a potent small-molecule tyrosine kinase 
inhibitor of VEGFR-1, VEGFR-2, and VEGFR-3, as well 
as c-Kit and PDGFR-β, that is currently being evaluated in 
multiple cancer types. Garland et al evaluated the efficacy 
of single-agent cediranib (45 mg) in a Phase II trial in MPM 
patients who were previously treated with platinum-based 
chemotherapy (SWOG S0509).36 In 43 evaluable patients, 
there were no CRs and only 4 patients (9%) achieved a 
PR. However, in responding patients, as much as 91% 
tumor shrinkage was observed. Sixteen patients (34%) 
achieved SD with a median TTP of 4.9 months. Nine per-
cent of patients had $ grade 3 toxicity, including fatigue, 
proteinuria, and gastrointestinal symptoms (diarrhea, 
colitis, ileal perforation, and esophageal necrosis).
A similar outcome was achieved in another Phase II trial 
of cediranib in patients with MPM who were chemotherapy 
naïve (12%) or whose disease progressed on one line of pre-
vious chemotherapy (88%). An almost identical number of 
responders were seen, with 10% having a PR and 34% having 
SD. The 45 mg dose of the drug was more effective than the 
30 mg dose (disease control rate 67% vs 34%, respectively, 
P=0.04), but also had a higher incidence of grade $3 toxicity 
(87% vs 43%, respectively, P=0.002).37
There is an ongoing Phase I/II randomized clinical trial 
examining the efficacy of low-dose cediranib (20 mg daily) in 
MPM when given concurrently with cisplatin and pemetrexed 
chemotherapy as first-line treatment for chemotherapy-naïve 
patients. Enrollment in this trial has been completed and 
results are expected in the next year (NCT01064648).
Nintedanib
Nintedanib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor of VEGFR, PDGFR, 
and FGFR, in addition to the Src and Abl tyrosine kinases.

Levin and Dowell
Currently, nintedanib is approved in the European Union 
and other countries to be used in combination with docetaxel 
in the treatment of NSCLC. Nintedanib is being evaluated 
in a randomized, Phase II/III trial in combination with 
cisplatin–pemetrexed chemotherapy in chemotherapy-naïve 
patients with unresectable MPM.38 The trial has completed 
the Phase II component, which demonstrated that nintedanib 
is well tolerated in combination with cisplatin–pemetrexed 
chemotherapy and significantly improved the median PFS 
survival in this population.39 The Phase III portion of the trial 
is currently recruiting patients (NCT01907100). Nintedanib 
is also being studied in a Phase II trial in the second-line 
setting in patients with unresectable MPM whose cancer has 
progressed or recurred after prior platinum-based therapy 
(NCT02568449).
Vatalanib (PTK787)
Vatalanib is an oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor of VEGFR-1, 
VEGFR-2, and PDGFR-β. It was investigated by the Cancer 
and Leukemia Group B in a multicenter Phase II trial as a 
monotherapy in unresectable MPM in the first-line setting.18 
Although the toxicity of the drug was very mild with few 
grade 3–4 adverse events reported, the drug showed limited 
efficacy. Out of 47 enrolled patients, only 6% achieved PR 
and 72% had SD. The median PFS was 4.1 months with 
a median OS of 10 months. The trial failed to achieve its 
primary endpoint of a 75% PFS at 3 months (a 55% PFS was 
observed), and therefore, further investigation of this drug as 
a monotherapy will not be continued in this disease.
Semaxanib (SU5416)
Semaxanib is a selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor of 
VEGFR-2. It was evaluated in a Phase II trial in 23 pre-
viously untreated patients with MPM. Eleven percent of 
patients showed a PR with a median OS of 12.4 months. No 
correlation between pretreatment serum VEGF, vascular cell 
adhesion molecule-1 and response or survival was identified. 
No further investigation of this drug in MPM is planned.40
Pazopanib
Pazopanib is a small-molecule inhibitor of VEGFR, PDGFR, 
FGFR, and c-Kit. It was studied in a single-arm Phase II 
trial in patients with MPM who received less than one prior 
systemic therapy. Patients were given pazopanib daily until 
toxicity or PD for up to 2 years. The primary endpoint was 
PFS at 6 months. A total of 34 patients were analyzed, with 
16 patients (47.8%) being progression free at 6 months of 
treatment. The median OS was 11.5 months (95% confidence 
interval: 6.2–18.2 months).41
Axitinib
Axitinib is another oral small-molecular inhibitor of 
VEGFR-1, VEGFR-2, VEGFR-3, PDGFR, and c-Kit. In 
a Phase II trial, chemotherapy-naïve MPM patients, who 
were medically suitable for limited surgical intervention, 
were randomized to receive pemetrexed and cisplatin with 
or without daily axitinib.42 Patients underwent thoracoscopy 
with biopsies before the treatment and after three cycles of 
chemotherapy. The second biopsy revealed that the number 
of new blood vessels in the tumor (microvessel density 
and immature blood vessels) increased after treatment with 
cisplatin and pemetrexed. This increase was blocked with 
axitinib. However, patients who were treated with axitinib 
showed increased expression of mRNA for a number of 
proangiogenic growth factors. Since axitinib had to be 
stopped 5 days before second thoracoscopy, rebound over-
expression of proangiogenic factors could have confounded 
the results. There was no difference in PFS or OS between 
the treatment groups. Of note, in the axitinib group, one 
patient developed a transient cerebrovascular accident on 
postoperative day 2 and another developed a pulmonary 
embolus during treatment.
Dovitinib (CHIR258, TKI258)
Dovitinib is a small-molecule multikinase inhibitor that 
inhibits several receptors, including VEGFRs, FGFRs, 
PDGFR-β, c-Kit, rearranged during transfection (RET), 
and Flt3.43 It was used in a Phase II trial as a single agent 
in patients with advanced pleural mesothelioma that had 
progressed after a first-line platinum–antifolate combination. 
The study was aborted after stage I accrual due to preliminary 
data showing lack of efficacy.44
Conclusion
VEGF-targeted therapies, including bevacizumab, have been 
extensively evaluated in MPM. Although initial Phase II trials 
in MPM failed to demonstrate a clear benefit with the addition 
of bevacizumab to standard chemotherapy in this disease, these 
studies were limited by small numbers of patients. The recently 
reported French MAPS demonstrated a statistically significant 
improvement in median OS with the combination of cisplatin, 
pemetrexed, and bevacizumab in MPM. The toxicity from the 
regimen was similar to that seen with the addition of beva-
cizumab to other chemotherapies in other malignancies, but 
significant rates of hypertension, cardiovascular events, and 
arterial and venous thromboembolic events were noted. The 
study included primarily patients with an ECOG performance 
status of 0 or 1 and employed extensive exclusion criteria to 
ensure that those patients at risk for serious side effects from

Bevacizumab in pleural mesothelioma
bevacizumab were not included. Therefore, the regimen is not 
appropriate for all patients with MPM. In addition, 81% of 
patients enrolled had epithelioid histology, and, as a result, the 
utility of this regimen in MPM patients with nonepithelioid 
histology is unclear. The MAPS study represents a signifi-
cant step forward in the treatment of unresectable MPM and 
has established the combination of cisplatin, pemetrexed, 
and bevacizumab as a reasonable option for appropriately 
selected MPM patients who are candidates to receive beva-
cizumab. Previous attempts to identify potential biomarkers 
as predictors of response to antiangiogenic treatment (includ-
ing microvessel density of the tumor, serum/plasma VEGF 
levels, and tissue VEGF/VEGFR expression), across a variety 
of malignancies and with numerous antiangiogenic agents, 
have failed to elucidate an ideal candidate. Hopefully, future 
trials will identify molecular correlates that can better eluci-
date the subset of MPM patients who benefit the most from 
bevacizumab. In addition, immunotherapy agents (including 
programmed cell death 1 [PD-1], programmed death ligand 1 
[PD-L1], and cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated 4 [CTLA-4] 
inhibitors) are currently being investigated in MPM and pre-
liminary studies show encouraging activity with these drugs. 
Emerging evidence also suggests that VEGF may suppress 
T-cell-mediated immune response, and therefore, anti-VEGF 
therapies may augment the effect of immunotherapy in can-
cer.45 This provides a strong preclinical rationale for future 
trials targeting VEGF in combination with immunotherapy 
in MPM. In fact, a trial of pembrolizumab and nintedanib is 
currently recruiting patients across different malignancies, 
including MPM (NCT02856425). In addition, the combina-
tion of bevacizumab with immunotherapy is being studied 
in renal and ovarian cancers, melanoma, and glioblastoma 
multiforme. Further clinical studies with bevacizumab-based 
chemotherapy regimens in combination with immunotherapy 
in patients with MPM are also anticipated.
