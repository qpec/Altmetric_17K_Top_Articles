ABSTRACT 
Oxidative damage is one of the hallmarks of the aging process. The current study evaluated 
effects of two proprietary antioxidant-based ingredients, rosemary extract and spearmint extract 
containing carnosic acid and rosmarinic acid, respectively, on learning and memory in the SAMP8 
mouse model of accelerated aging.  The two rosemary extracts contained carnosic acid (60% or 10% 
carnosic acid) and one spearmint extract contained 5% rosmarinic acid. Three doses of actives in each 
extract were tested: 32, 16, 1.6 or 0 mg/kg. After 90 days of treatment mice were tested in T-maze foot 
shock avoidance, object recognition and lever press. Rosemary extract containing 60% carnosic acid 
improved acquisition and retention in T-maze foot shock, object recognition and lever press. Rosemary 
extract with 10% carnosic acid improved retention in T-maze foot shock avoidance and lever press. 
Spearmint with 5% rosmarinic acid improved acquisition and retention in T-maze foot shock avoidance 
and object recognition. 4-hydroxynonenal (HNE) was reduced in the brain cortex after treatment with 
all three extracts (P<0.001) compared to the vehicle treated SAMP8. Protein carbonyls were reduced in 
the hippocampus after administration of rosemary with 10% carnosic acid (P<0.05) and spearmint 
containing 5% rosmarinic acid (P<0.001). The current results indicate that the extracts from spearmint 
and rosemary have beneficial effects on learning and memory and brain tissue markers of oxidation 
that occur with age in SAMP8 mice.

1. INTRODUCTION 
 
As the number of elderly adults (>65 years of age) worldwide is expected to more than double 
by the year 2030 and individuals are staying in the workforce longer, the need to stay cognitively fit is 
increasing. Thus, the development of natural interventions aimed at slowing or preventing cognitive 
decline naturally associated with aging is critical. Botanical ingredients and nutrients have been investigated 
as a solution to this growing concern. 
 
Oxidative damage is considered one of the hallmarks of the aging process (1). The neuronal 
dysfunction present in diseases associated with aging such as Alzheimer’s disease is thought in large 
part to be from oxidative stress (2; 3; 4). Free radicals which lead to oxidative stress are thought to be 
responsible for aging (5). Aging and its related diseases are consequences of free radical damage to 
cellular molecules and the inability of endogenous antioxidants to counter balance these changes. 
Oxidative stress leads to changes in the mitochrondria, membrane fatty acid composition, protein 
oxidation and inflammation (6).  
 
The senescence-accelerated mouse (SAM) is a model of accelerated senescence that was 
established through phenotypic selection from a common genetic pool of AKR/J strain (7) SAMP8 mice 
have age-related impairment in learning and memory that coincides with increased levels of lipid and 
protein oxidation (8). Antioxidants have been found to reverse learning and memory deficits in SAMP8 
mice.  Alpha-lipoic acid and n-acetyl cysteine enhance memory and reverse indices of oxidative stress 
in these mice (9). Alpha-lipoic acid significantly decreased carbonyl levels of lactate dehydrogenase B, 
dihydro pyrimindase-like protein and alpha enolase (10).Plant extracts that contain antioxidants, such as 
extra virgin olive oil, have also been found to improve learning and memory in SAMP8 mice and 
reverse indices of oxidative stress (11).  
 
Carnosic acid (CA) and rosmarinic acid (RA) are polyphenol plant extracts that have been 
found to be neuroprotective and preventative against oxidative stress (1; 12; 13). CA has been shown to 
prevent inflammation and cell death (13; 14). CA prevents inflammation produced by lippopolysacchride 
administration (15) and cell death produced by 6-hydroxydopamine (16). Rosemarinus officinalis L. leaf 
extract, which contains CA, has been found to inhibit acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity (17). What 
makes these antioxidants unique is that they are converted to their active forms by oxidative stress (18). 
     CA and RA have been reported to exert behavioral effects in rodents including memory 
enhancement, anti-stress and antidepressant like effects (19; 20). Protection against oxidative stress and 
inflammation has been associated with improved memory in diseases of aging (11). RA improved 
memory in the Morris water maze spatial memory task and passive avoidance (17; 21). CA and RA

reduced immobility in the tail suspension test and altering monoaminergic and cholinergic function and 
gene expression in the brain associated with depression (20). 
      The current study was designed to test if these two antioxidants found naturally in rosemary extract 
and spearmint extract, CA and RA, respectively, could improve learning and memory in the SAMP8 
mouse model of accelerated aging. We have previously shown the ability of antioxidants to improve 
learning and memory deficits in the SAMP8 mice and reverse signs of oxidative damage (9; 11); 
therefore, the SAMP8 mice are an excellent model to test these antioxidant compounds (22). 
 
 
 
2. METHODS 
2.1 MICE 
 
At the start of treatment, the subjects for the experiments were 9 month old SAMP8 male mice 
from the breeding colony at the VA Medical Center, St. Louis. The control group was 9 month old 50% 
SAM male mice from our breeding colony. The SAMP8 were generously provided to our laboratory 
from Dr. T Takeda of Kyoto University in Japan in the late 1980’s and maintained as an inbred strain. 
The SAM 50% is a cross between a male SAMP8 and a female CD-1 mouse which do not show age-
related impairment in learning and memory. Sentinels from the facility were tested regularly to ensure 
our facility was virus- and pathogen- free. Food (Richland 5001) and water were available on an ad 
libitum basis, and the rooms had a 12 hour light-dark cycle with lights on at 0600 hours. Experiments 
were conducted between 0730 and 1400 hours. These studies were conducted at VA Medical Center, 
St. Louis and were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee at the VA Medical Center, St. 
Louis, MO. 
 
2.2 TREATMENT 
 
Nine month old SAMP8 male mice received rosemary extract containing either 60% or 10% 
CA or spearmint extract containing 5% RA (all extracts obtained from Kemin Foods, L.C. ) for 16 
weeks once/day via oral gavage at approximately 0900 hour (n=12 per group at the start of the study). 
All extracts were tested for solvent, heavy metal, microbial and pesticide analysis. In addition, the rosemary 
extracts standardized for carnosic acid contained less than 0.1% rosmarinic acid while the spearmint extract with 
rosmarinic acid standardized for rosmarinic acid contained nondetectable levels of carnosic acid. In the first 
study, we examined the effect of 60% CA (CA60). The SAMP8 mice were randomly assigned to one 
of 4 treatment groups: 1.) CA60 - 32 mg/kg of carnosic acid, 2.) CA60 - 16 mg/kg carnosic acid, 3.)

CA60 - 1.6 mg/kg and 4.) vehicle (sunflower oil). The control strain received 5.) vehicle (sunflower 
oil) treated 50%SAM. In the second study, we examined rosemary extract containing 10% CA (CA10). 
The SAMP8 mice were randomly assigned to one of 4 treatment groups: 1.) CA10 - 32 mg/kg of 
carnosic acid, 2.) CA10 - 16 mg/kg carnosic acid, 3.) CA60 - 1.6 mg/kg and 4.) vehicle (sunflower oil). 
The control strain received 5.) vehicle (sunflower oil) treated 50%SAM. The third study, we examined 
the effects of spearmint extract containing 5% rosmarinic acid (RA).  The SAMP8 mice were randomly 
assigned to one of 4 treatment groups: 1.) RA - 32 mg/kg of rosmarinic acid, 2.) RA - 16 mg/kg 
rosmarinic acid, 3.) RA - 1.6 mg/kg rosmarinic acid and 4.) vehicle (water). The control strain received 
5.) vehicle (water) treated 50%SAM. 
Sunflower oil was used as the vehicle control for the rosemary extracts containing CA because 
sunflower oil was used in the standardization of the extract and water was used as the vehicle control 
for the spearmint extract with RA. All treatments were administered via oral gavage. Body weights 
were recorded weekly throughout the study.  
 
2.3 BEHAVIORAL TESTING 
 
Behavioral testing was started in the twelfth week of treatment. Mice were first trained in T-
maze foot shock avoidance during week 12 (T-maze session I) and T-maze (session 2) was performed 
in week 13, followed by object recognition in week 13. Lever press was performed during weeks 14 
and 15. All testing was performed and recorded by someone that was blinded to the treatment groups.  
 
2.3.1 T-Maze training and testing procedures  
 
The T-maze has previously been used by us to access learning and memory in the SAMP8 
mouse (11; 23; 24; 25; 26; 27; 28; 29). The task requires an intact hippocampus to perform well. Damage to 30% 
of the hippocampus impairs both learning and memory performance in the T-maze using the same 
design as in the current study (30). The T-maze is a complex task. The idea of the task is that the mice 
learn to avoid the shock by moving from the start box to the clear escape box located at the end of one 
arm before the start of the shock which occurs 5 sec after the simultaneous opening of the door and the 
initiation of the buzzer. The T-maze consisted of a black plastic alley with a start box at one end and 
two arms at the other end. The start box was separated from the alley by a black plastic guillotine door 
that prevented movement down the alley until the door was raised by the investigator at the onset of 
training.  A clear plastic liner was used as a “goal box”. It was placed at the end of one of the two arms

based upon conditions described below. An electrifiable floor of stainless steel rods ran throughout the 
maze to deliver a mild scrambled foot-shock. 
 
Mice were not permitted to explore the maze prior to session 1. A block of trials was initiated 
when a mouse was placed into the start box. The guillotine door was raised and a cue buzzer sounded 
simultaneously; 5 sec later foot-shock was applied. The arm of the maze entered on the first trial was 
designated “incorrect” and the mild foot-shock was continued until the mouse entered the other arm 
where the goal box had been placed at the end, this becomes the designated “correct” side for the goal 
box location for that particular mouse for all remaining trials in session 1, and during session 2. At the 
end of each trial, the mouse is removed from the goal box and returned to its home cage until the next 
trial. 
 
Mice were trained in session one until they succeeded in avoiding the foot shock one time. 
Avoidance of the shock occurs when once the buzzer has sounded and the door opened 
(simultaneously), and the mouse traversed down the alley entering the correct arm and into the goal 
box in less than 5 sec. Session one the latency to escape the shock on trial, as well as number of 
left/right errors for the entire session and the number of trials attempted until the mouse makes one 
avoidance of the shock were recorded. Training used an inter-trial interval of 35 sec, the buzzer was a 
door-bell type which sounded at 55 dB, and shock was set at 0.35 mA (Coulbourn Instruments 
scrambled grid floor shocker model E13-08). A second T-maze session was performed one week later 
by continuing training until mice made 5 avoidances of the foot shock in 6 consecutive trials. The 
lower the number of trials to 5 avoidances during session 2 the greater retention of the information 
learned during session one. The results for the T-maze session two were reported as the number of 
trials to make 5 avoidances in 6 consecutive trials. 
 
2.3.2 Object -Place Recognition 
 
Object-place recognition is a memory task that involves the hippocampus when, as performed 
here, the retention interval being 24 hours after initial exposure to the objects (11). Mice were habituated 
to an empty apparatus for 5 minutes a day for 3 days prior to entry of the objects. During the training 
session, the mouse was exposed to two similar objects (plastic frogs) which it was allowed to examine 
for 5 minutes. The apparatus and the objects were cleaned between each mouse. The time spent 
exploring the two objects was recorded. Twenty-four hours later, the mouse was exposed to one of the 
original objects and a novel object in a new location. The amount of time spent examining the objects 
was recorded. The percentage of time spent exploring the novel object based on total time spent

exploring either object was reported. The novel object was made out of the same material as the 
original object and of the same size, but a different shape. This eliminated the possibility of the smell 
associated with a particular object being a confounding factor. The underlying concept of the task is 
based on the tendency of mice to spend more time exploring new, novel objects rather than familiar 
objects. Thus, the more time spent with the novel object the greater the retention/memory if the 
previously exposed object at 24 hours. 
 
2.3.3 Lever Press for Milk Reinforcement 
Mice were first habituated to milk the week prior to the lever press by removing food and water 
overnight for 3 nights and verifying that the mice drank at least 15mL by the morning on the third 
night. Any mouse not drinking milk was not used in the lever press. Lever press is a procedural 
(operant) associative learning and memory task. Mice were placed into a fully automated lever press 
chamber. Pressing a lever on one wall of the compartment caused a light and an arm with a liquid 
dipper with 100 µl of milk to appear in an opening in the wall where is can place its head located on the 
opposite wall. Prior to the start of testing on day one only, the mouse is placed in the apparatus and the 
lever is activated by the investigator for the mouse to learn the food cup when visible contains milk. 
Once the mouse has drunk the milk one time the session begins. The pretrial training on the availability 
of milk does not train the mouse how to press the lever to activate the arm which rises up into the box 
displaying the food cup.  On day 1 the mice had 11 sec to obtain the reward; on all subsequent days, 
mice had 6 sec obtain the reward once it had press the lever. The reward availability was on a fixed 
ratio schedule, one press of the lever leads to one 100 µl reward (FR1) for the entire study. Mice were 
given 40 min training sessions on M, W, F for two weeks. Mice were food deprived 16 hours prior to 
the start of the test to provide motivation to perform the task. Food was returned immediately upon 
completion of a session. The number of rewarded level presses was recorded by Graphic State 2, 
Coulbourn Instruments (Whithall, PA). Acquisition was measured as the number of rewarded lever 
presses (22).  
 
2.4 OXIDATIVE STRESS 
 
2.4.1 Sample Preparation 
Brain samples were briefly homogenized with a Wheaton tissue homogenizer in an ice-cold lysis 
buffer (pH 7.4) containing 320 mM sucrose, 1% mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.8), 0.098 mM MgCl2, 0.076  mM

EDTA, and proteinase inhibitors leupeptin (0.5 mg/mL), pepstatin (0.7 μg/ml), aprotinin (0.5 mg/ml) 
and PMSF (40 μg/ml) and a phosphatase inhibitor cocktail. The homogenized samples were then 
diluted 2X with lysis buffer.  After homogenization and dilution, a small aliquot of homogenized 
samples were sonicated for 10 seconds at 20% power with a Fisher 550 Sonic Dismembrator 
(Pittsburgh, PA, USA) and frozen. The remaining homogenate was centrifuged at 3000 g for 5 min and 
the supernatant cytosolic and membranous fractions were transferred out into another set of tubes. 
Following the addition of 400 μl of lysis buffer, the remaining pellet nuclear fraction was centrifuged at 
3,000 x g for 5 min and supernatant removed. The pellet was suspended in 20 μl of lysis buffer and 
inhibitor. The supernatant cytosolic and membranous fractions were centrifuged at 10,000 x g for 10 
min, and the resulting supernatant cytosolic fraction was transferred out into another set of tubes 
leaving the pellet membranous fraction. All sonicated samples and fractions were stored at -70 ˚C until 
used for further experiments.  Protein concentrations were measured through Pierce Bicinchoninic Acid 
(BCA) method. 
 
2.4.2 Slot blot analysis  
Protein Carbonyls 
     For protein carbonyl detection, slot blot analysis of the 2,4-dinitrophenyl hydrazone (DNP) Schiff-
base adduct of the carbonyls was employed. Sample aliquots of 5 μl were incubated at room 
temperature with 5 μl of 12% sodium dodecyl sulfate and 10 μl of 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine (from 
OxyBlotTM Protein oxidation kit, Chemicon-millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) for 20 min, followed by 
the addition of 7.5  μl of neutralization  solution containing Tris (2 M) in 30% glycerol to each sample. 
Following derivatization samples were diluted to 1 μg/mL using 1x phosphate buffer solution (PBS) 
containing sodium chloride, mono, and dibasic sodium phosphate. The corresponding sample solutions 
(250 μl) were rapidly loaded as duplicates onto a nitrocellulose membrane through water vacuum 
pressure. The resulting protein-bound nitrocellulose membrane was then blocked with fresh blocking 
solution containing 750 mg of bovine serum albumin (BSA) in 25 ml of wash blot containing 35.2 g 
sodium chloride, 1.77 g monobasic sodium phosphate, 9.61 g dibasic sodium phosphate and 1.6 mL 
TWEEN, diluted to 4 L with deionized water for 90 min. The membrane was then incubated with 
polyclonal RbxDNP (from OxyBlottm Protein oxidation kit, Chemicon-millipore, Billerica, MA, USA, 
dilution 1:100) in wash blot for 2 h. After three 5 min washes with fresh wash blot, the membrane was 
then incubated  with polyclonal anti-rabbit IgG alkaline phosphatase (Chemicon, Temecula, CA, USA, 
dilution 1:8000) for 1 hour and washed with fresh wash blot in three increments of 5, 10 and 10 min.

After washing, the membrane was developed colorimetrically using a 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-
phosphate/nitroblue tetrazolium reagent solution for alkaline phosphatase secondary antibody. After 
development, blots were dried and scanned on a CanoScan8800F (Canon) scanner using Adobe 
Photoshop and analyzed using Scion Image software (Scion Corporation). 
 
2.4.3 4-Hydroxy-2-trans-noneal (HNE) 
Levels of protein-bound HNE are used as a marker of lipid peroxidation and were determined as 
previously described [29]. For slot blot analysis of protein-bound HNE detection, sample aliquots of 5 
μl were incubated at room temperature with 5 μl of 12% sodium dodecyl sulfate and 10 μl of Laemmli 
buffer for 20 min, followed by dilution to 1 μg/ml using 1x phosphate buffer solution (PBS) containing 
sodium chloride, mono, and dibasic sodium phosphate. The corresponding sample solutions (250 μl) 
were rapidly loaded as duplicates onto a nitrocellulose membrane through water vacuum pressure. The 
resulting protein-bound nitrocellulose membrane was then blocked with fresh blocking solution for 90 
min. The membrane was then incubated with polyclonal anti-HNE (Alpha diagnostic, San Antonio, 
TX, USA, dilution 1:5000) in wash blot for 2 h. After three 5 min washes with fresh wash blot, the 
membrane was then incubated  with polyclonal anti-rabbit IgG alkaline phosphatase (Chemicon, 
Temecula, CA, USA, dilution 1:8000) for 1 hour and washed with fresh wash blot in three increments 
of 5, 10 and 10 min. After washing, the membrane was developed colorimetrically using a 5-bromo-4-
chloro-3-indolyl-phosphate/nitroblue tetrazolium reagent solution for alkaline phosphatase secondary 
antibody. After development, blots were dried and scanned on a CanoScan8800F (Canon) scanner 
using Adobe Photoshop and analyzed using Scion Image software (Scion Corporation).  
 
 
2.4.4 3-Nitrotyrosine (3-NT) 
3-NT levels were used as an additional marker of protein oxidative damage [5,28]. Samples (5 µL) 
were incubated at room temperature for 20 min in 5 µL of 12% SDS and 10 µl of Laemmli buffer 
(0.125 M Trizma base, 4% SDS, 20% glycerol), for 20 min. Samples (250 ng of protein) per slot were 
blotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane. A primary rabbit antibody (Sigma-Aldrich) specific for 3-NT 
(1:1000) was used. The same secondary goat anti-rabbit (Sigma-Aldrich) antibody was then used for 
detection of each primary antibody. Blots were developed and quantified as described above for protein 
carbonyls. The developing and detection were performed as described above for protein carbonyls.

2.4.5 Triglycerides 
     We have previously shown that elevated triglycerides are associated with impaired learning and 
memory (22). Serum triglyceride was quantitated using an enzymatic assay system from Pointe 
Scientific, Inc. (Canton, MI) which incorporated a linear, endpoint color reaction.  Triglycerides in the 
sample are hydrolyzed by lipase to glycerol.  The glycerol is then phosphorylated by glycerol kinase 
and ATP to glycerol-3-phosphate (G3P) and ADP.  The G3P is converted to dihydroxyacetone 
phosphate (DAP) and hydrogen peroxide.  The hydrogen peroxide reacts with 4-aminoantipyrine (4-
AAP) and 3-hydroxy-2,4,6-tribomobenzoic acid (TBHB) in a reaction catalyzed by peroxidase to yield 
a red colored quinoneimine dye.  The intensity of color produced was measured at 540 nm using a Bio-
Rad microplate reader (Hercules, CA). 
 
2.5 STATISTICS 
 
Results were analyzed using analysis of variance (ANOVA) to examine the effect among 
groups. The measure of acquisition and retention in the T-maze were the number of trials to reach 
criterion. The results for object recognition are presented in percentage of time spent exploring the 
novel object out of total exploration time. Lever press was analyzed by a two-way repeated measures 
ANOVA. Results are expressed as means ± standard errors. Dunnett’s or Tukey’s post hoc analyses 
were used as indicated in the results section. Tukey’s post hoc analyses were used to compare means in 
the two-way ANOVAs. Dunnett's was used after one-way ANOVAs for comparison to the SAMP8 
vehicle control group.  The brain tissue oxidative stress parameters were analyzed using a Mann-
Whitney U test.  
 
 
3. RESULTS 
3.1 ROSEMARY EXTRACT CONTAINING 60% CARNOSIC ACID (CA60) 
3.1.1 Behavioral Testing 
T-maze: The one-way ANOVA for trials to first avoidance in session one for CA60 produced a 
significant treatment effect F(4, 48) 8.98, p<0.001 (Figure 1a). Dunnett’s post hoc test indicated that 
the SAMP8 mice that received 32 mg/kg CA60 took significantly fewer trials to make one avoidance 
than the mice that received vehicle. One-way ANOVA for latency to escape shock on trial 1 was not 
significant F(4,47) = 1.12, p NS. The number of side choice errors by treatment during session 1 was 
not significant F(4,47) = 2.39, p NS. The one-way ANOVA for trials to criterion in the T-maze session

2 showed a significant treatment effect F(4,47) = 7.25, p<0.001 (Figure 1b). Dunnett’s post hoc 
analysis indicated that the SAMP8 mice that received 32, 16 and 1.6 mg/kg CA60 took significantly 
fewer trials to reach criterion than the SAMP8 mice that received vehicle.  
Object Recognition: The one-way ANOVA for total time spent exploring the two similar objects on 
day 1 was not significant F(4,46)=1.33, p NS (Figure 1c). The one-way ANOVA for time spent 
exploring the novel object on the 24 hour retention test produced a significant treatment effect F(4,46) 
= 4.88, p<0.003 for mice administered CA60 (Figure 1d). Dunnett’s post hoc test indicated that the 
SAMP8 mice which received 32 and 16 mg/kg CA60 spent significantly greater amount of time 
exploring the novel object than the SAMP8 mice which received vehicle p<0.05. In addition, the 
SAMP8 mice which received 32 and 16 mg/kg CA60 were not significantly different from each other 
or the SAM 50% controls.  
Lever Press: The two-way repeated measures ANOVA, treatment x day, for number of rewarded lever 
presses produced a significant effect for treatment F(4,257) = 17.27, p<0.001 and day F(5,257) = 15.31, 
p<0.001 for mice administered CA60 (Figure 1e) . The interaction treatment x day was not significant 
F(20,257) = 3.78, p>0.05. Tukey's post hoc analysis indicated that on days 3, 4, 5 and 6, SAMP8 mice 
which received 32 mg/kg CA from CA60 received significantly more rewards than the SAMP8 mice 
which received sunflower oil (vehicle). The SAMP8 mice which received 16 mg/kg CA60 received 
significantly more rewards on days 4, 5, and 6 compared to the SAMP8 mice which received vehicle.  
3.1.2 Triglyceride Levels 
The one-way ANOVA for triglyceride levels was not significant F(4,46) = 2.35, p>0.05 for mice 
administered CA60  (Figure 2d). 
3.1.3 Oxidative Stress 
Mann-Whitney U test indicated that CA60 significantly decreased 4-hydroxynonenal (HNE) in the 
cortex at 1.6 and 32 mg/kg CA from CA60 in comparison to SAMP8 administered sunflower oil as a 
vehicle control (Table 1). There was no significant effect of CA60 on 3-nitrotyrosine (3-NT) or protein

to the vehicle treated control SAMP8 mice within the striatum. RA significantly reduced levels of 3-NT 
and protein carbonyls in the hippocampus at 16 mg/kg.  
 
4. DISCUSSION 
 
In the current study all the extracts tested, spearmint extract containing RA (5%) and rosemary 
extract containing two levels of CA (60% and 10%) improved learning and memory. While both the 10 
and 60% CA extract treatments significantly improved T-maze session two and level press test results, 
only the 60% CA extract treatment showed significant improvements in session 2 of the T-maze and 
object recognition. There was no difference in latency to escape the shock on the first trial of T-maze 
indicating that the extract did not affect motivation to escape a noxious stimulus. There no difference 
on day one of object recognition in exploration time indicating each group was equally habituated to 
the initial object when presented in the 24 hour retention test. The spearmint extract with RA improved 
acquisition in the T-maze and memory in in object recognition memory. There was no difference in 
latency to escape the shock on the first trial of T-maze indicating that the extract had no effect on 
motivation to escape a noxious stimulus. There no difference on day one of object recognition in 
exploration time indicating each group was equally habituated to the initial object when presented in 
the 24 hour retention test. There was no difference in triglyceride level in the SAMP8 mice that 
received vehicle and the SAMP8 mice that received an extract. These findings indicate that the extracts 
were not improving memory by lowering triglycerides in the SAMP8 mice. We have previously 
reported that elevated triglycerides can impair memory in mice (22). All three compounds decreased 
HNE in the cortex and protein carbonyls were reduced in the hippocampus following the administration 
of the 10% CA and the 5% RA extracts. None of the compounds had an effect on body weight or

triglyceride levels. These studies suggest that the current novel extractions of carnosic and rosmarinic 
acid from rosemary and spearmint are natural products that are beneficial at preventing learning and 
memory deficits associated a mouse model of accelerated aging.  
 
Both extracts worked in a dose-response fashion on memory. This is not surprising as most 
memory enhancing compounds demonstrate hormesis (31).  Hormesis is the phenomena where there is 
an optimal dose for memory enhancement of memory whereas doses that are too high may have a 
negative effect. This was previously reported in water maze testing with RA and in its anxiolytic ability 
as tested in an elevated plus maze (21; 31). This study used a “stress” condition in a normal healthy, non-
aging mouse model and found a cognitive-enhancing capability. RA was also shown to work in models 
of Aβ toxicity where it protected against toxicity in mice injected with Aβ (32). In the current study, we 
found that spearmint with RA prevented memory loss in a mouse model that naturally overproduces 
Aβ.  
 
The findings in the current study are similar to previous findings following antioxidant 
supplementation in SAMP8 mice. Alpha lipoic acid improved learning and memory following only 
one-week of treatment in 12 month old SAMP8  mice and after just 2 weeks in 18 month old SAMP8 
mice (9; 32). The antioxidant docosahexaenic acid, found in fish oil, also improved learning and memory 
in SAMP8 mice (33). Supplementation of mulberry extract, rich in the antioxidant anthocyanins, resulted 
in improved avoidance learning and memory, reduced cholesterol and reduced indices of oxidative 
stress in SAMP8 mice (34). In addition, these findings are encouraging as several of the above 
mentioned molecules/extracts have demonstrated positive effects in follow-up human clinical trials for 
cognition, indicating the predictive and translatable nature of this model from rodent to human (35; 36).  
 
Protein and lipid oxidation occurs in SAMP8 mouse brains with age (10; 32; 37). Proteins and 
lipids play important roles in the normal structure and function of cells (38). Abnormal cell function and 
eventual cell death can occur with oxidative modification of proteins in cells (39). In the present study, 
sensitive immunochemical methods were used to determine if treatment with the antioxidants had any 
effect on protein carbonyl levels. These results indicated a decrease in protein oxidation in the 
hippocampus (following administration of rosemary extract with 10% CA or the spearmint extract with 
5% RA) and decreased lipid oxidation in the cortex (following administration of all extracts). Both the 
hippocampus and cortex have been found to be important areas for T-maze learning and memory [37, 
38]. In addition, studies have found that the hippocampus is important for memory in object 
recognition when using a 24 hour retention delay (40). These data demonstrate that both rosemary

extract with CA and spearmint extract with RA can help in reversing oxidative changes that occur with 
aging and cognitive decline in SAMP8 mice.  
 
Many antioxidants do not cross the blood-brain-barrier (BBB); however, RA has been detected 
in the brain after intraperitoneal injection (41). Administration of RA in cultured neurons indicates that it 
is capable of blocking neuroinflammatory cytokines in the BBB (42). Inflammation is thought to play a 
key role in the BBB breakdown with age (42). Here, we see improved learning and memory suggesting 
that peripheral administration had a positive effect on brain function.  
 
Although the current study found positive effects on markers of oxidative stress, there were 
some markers that went the opposite direct. This is similar to some other reports showing on negative 
effects of polyphenols on oxidative stress. Polyphenols, such a quercetin, have been found to be 
detrimental to neurons at high doses (43). Another possible mechanism of action by which polyphenols 
may act on learning and memory is through inducing cellular stress responses that result in the up 
regulation of protective genes (44; 45; 46). The present study, we found some negative effect on oxidative 
stress markers suggestion that not of its all actions of the compounds are through decreases in the 
markers of oxidative stress explored here.  
 
Dietary supplements and additives increase in number each year. The benefits of these 
supplements are controversial (47). Nutritional antioxidants rich in polyphenolics may help lower the 
incidence of disease, such as certain cancers, cardiovascular disease and have reported anti-aging 
properties (48). There are many reports of positive beneficial results in the animal literature (11; 49; 50). 
Previous work in humans has not always been as positive (5; 51). However, there have been some 
positive results with cancer using selenium especially in men (52) and recently studies utilizing extra 
virgin olive oil and vitamin E have had positive results on markers of inflammation (53; 54). The current 
study using both rosemary extract with CA and spearmint extract with RA suggests that when provided 
at the appropriate dose these molecules have the potential to delay or prevent age-related memory 
impairments.  
 
In the current study, the natural antioxidants, rosemary extract with CA and spearmint extract 
with RA, were orally supplemented to determine if they had beneficial effects on learning and memory 
in the SAMP8 mouse model of the cognitive dysfunction. The extracts are natural products that when 
extracted from the rosemary and spearmint result in positive effects on memory in a mouse model that 
develops age-related memory decline. To our knowledge this is the first study showing prevention of 
cognitive decline following administration of either rosemary extract with CA or spearmint extract with 
RA in a mouse model of cognitive decline due to accelerated aging. These findings suggest that

rosemary extract with CA and spearmint extract with RA are potential natural nutritional interventions 
for age-associated cognitive decline.

Figure 1. Effects of rosemary extract containing 60% carnosic acid on T-maze foot shock avoidance. 
Rosemary extract containing 60% carnosic acid had a greater impact on memory in session 2 than 
learning in session 1 with only 32 mg/kg CA60 improving performance in session 1 (Figure 1a) 
whereas 1.6, 16 and 32 mg/kg CA60 improved performance in session 2 compared to the SAMP8 
vehicle controls (Figure 1d). There was no effect on escape time in trial one of session one suggesting 
that the extract had no effect on either the ability to detect shock nor the motivation to escape it (Figure 
1b). There was also no effect on the number of trials it took each group to learning the correct side of 
the maze with the location of the escape box suggesting that the temporal component was the most 
difficult to learn and remember (Figure 1c) . The * indicates P<0.05 and ** indicates P<0.01. The 
values represent means + SEM.  
 
Figure 2. The effects of rosemary extract containing 60% caronic acid on retention object recognition 
and learning in the operant lever press. Rosemary extract containing 60% carnosic acid had not effect 
on exploration time on day 1 with 2 like objects in novel object recognition (Figure 2a). The extract 
improved object recognition retention on day 2, the mice that received 16 and 32 mg/kg spent 
significantly more time with the novel object compared to the SAMP8 mice that received vehicle 
(Figure 2b) and operant learning in the lever press (FR1) on day 3, 4 and 5 at 32 mg/kg CA60 and days 
4 and 5 at 16 mg/kg compared to the SAMP8 vehicle control (Figure 2c). The * indicates P<0.05 and 
the ** indicates P<0.01 compared to the Veh SAM. Values represent means + SEM in object 
recognition. Only the means are represented in the lever press for graph readability.   
 
Figure 3. Effects of rosemary extract containing 10% carnosic acid (CA10) on T-maze foot shock 
avoidance. Rosemary extract containing CA10 had no effect on T-maze performance in session 1 
(Figure 3a). CA10 improved T-maze performance in session 2 at 16 mg/kg (Figure 2d).  There was no 
difference in escape latencies during Trial 1 session 1 (Figure 3b). There was a difference in number of 
direction errors with any of the extract doses compared to the Veh SAM during session 1. There was a 
difference between Veh SAM and  Veh 50% mice which took significantly fewer trials to learn which 
direction (L/R) compared to the Veh SAM mice (Figure 3c). The * indicates P<0.05 and the ** 
indicates P<0.01 compared to the vehicle treated SAMP8 mice. Values represent means + SEM. 
 
Figure 4. Effects of CA10 on novel object recognition and operant lever press. CA10 had no effect on 
exploration time during day 1 of novel object recognition (Figure 4a) or 24 hour retention in novel 
object recognition (Figure 4b). CA10 however, improved operant learning at 16 (days 4 & 5) and 32 
mg/kg (days 3, 4 & 5) CA10 in the lever press (FR1) compared to the Veh SAM (Figure 4c). The * 
indicates P<0.05 and the ** indicates P<0.01 compared to the vehicle treated SAMP8 mice. Values 
represent means + SEM. The * indicates P<0.05 and the * Only the means are represented in the lever 
press for graph readability.  * indicates P<0.01 compared to the vehicle treated SAMP8 mice. Values 
represent means + SEM.  
 
Figure 5: Effects of spearmint extract containing 5% rosmarinic acid (RA) on T-maze foot shock 
avoidance.  RA improved T-maze performance in session 1 at 16 and 32 mg/kg (Figure 5a). RA had no 
effect on escape latencies during trial 1 session 1 or number of L/R direction errors during session 1 
Figures 5b and c). RA improved performance in session 2 at 1.6, 16 and 32 mg/kg RA (Figure 5d). The 
* indicates P<0.05 and the ** indicates P<0.01 compared to the vehicle treated SAMP8 mice. Values 
represent means + SEM. 
 
Figure 6: Effects of RA on novel object recognition and operant lever press. RA had no effect on 
exploration on day 1 with the 2 like objects in novel object recognition (Figure 6a). RA improved novel

object recognition memory at 16 and 32 mg/kg RA on the 24 hour test with on similar and one novel 
object recognition (Figure 6b). Spearmint extract containing RA had no effect on operant learning 
(FR1) (Figure 3c). The * indicates P<0.05 and the ** indicates P<0.01 compared to the SAMP8 vehicle 
control. Values represent means + SEM. Only the means are represented in the lever press for graph
