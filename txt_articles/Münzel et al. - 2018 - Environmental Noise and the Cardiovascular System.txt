ABSTRACT
Noise has been found associated with annoyance, stress, sleep disturbance, and impaired cognitive performance.
Furthermore, epidemiological studies have found that environmental noise is associated with an increased incidence of
arterial hypertension, myocardial infarction, heart failure, and stroke. Observational and translational studies indicate
that especially nighttime noise increases levels of stress hormones and vascular oxidative stress, which may lead to
endothelial dysfunction and arterial hypertension. Novel experimental studies found aircraft noise to be associated with
oxidative stress–induced vascular damage, mediated by activation of the NADPH oxidase, uncoupling of endothelial
nitric oxide synthase, and vascular infiltration with inflammatory cells. Transcriptome analysis of aortic tissues from
animals exposed to aircraft noise revealed changes in the expression of genes responsible for the regulation of
vascular function, vascular remodeling, and cell death. This review focuses on the mechanisms and the
epidemiology of noise-induced cardiovascular diseases and provides novel insight into the mechanisms underlying
noise-induced vascular damage. (J Am Coll Cardiol 2018;71:688–97) © 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier on

global
burden
of
disease
has
shifted
within the last decades from communicable,
maternal, perinatal, and nutritional causes
to noncommunicable diseases, such as atheroscle-
rosis (1). Although medical and scientific efforts
have focused primarily on diagnosis, treatment, and
prevention of traditional cardiovascular risk factors
(e.g., diabetes, smoking, arterial hypertension, and
hyperlipidemia) (1), recent studies indicate that also
risk factors in the physical environment may facilitate
the development of cardiovascular disease (CVD) (1).
With industrialization and globalization, the impor-
tance of new environmental factors, such as noise
and air pollution, is becoming increasingly evident.
Within the last decade, several studies have found
traffic noise (road, aircraft, and railway noise) to be
associated with increased risk of cardiovascular and
metabolic diseases (2–4). Already in 2011, Babisch
(4) published the statement “The question at present
is no longer whether noise causes cardiovascular ef-
fects, it is rather: what is the magnitude of the effect
in
terms
of
the
exposure-response
relationship
(slope) and the onset or possible threshold (intercept)
of the increase in risk.” Until recently, the precise
mechanisms
underlying
noise-induced
CVD
were
largely unknown, mainly because of lack of models
for translational research in humans and animals.
Noise annoyance and chronic stress, activation of
the autonomic and endocrine system, and distur-
bance of sleep are proposed to ultimately lead to
pathophysiologic (vascular) alterations in the inter-
mediate or chronic timeframe contributing directly

 or indirectly to initiation and progression of CVD
(4,5). The present review focuses on novel transla-
tional noise studies, demonstrating which underlying
molecular mechanisms may lead to impaired vascular
function, and recent epidemiologic evidence of noise-
induced
CVD.
We
also
address
the
nonauditory
effects of noise and their impact on the cardiovascu-
lar system.
ADVERSE EFFECTS OF ENVIRONMENTAL
NOISE ON THE AUTONOMIC NERVOUS
SYSTEM AND CONSEQUENCES FOR THE
CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM
According to the noise reaction model introduced by
Babisch (5), CVD can be caused by an “indirect
pathway,” where lower levels of noise disturb sleep,
communication,
and
activities,
with
subsequent
emotional and cognitive responses and annoyance. A
resulting chronic stress reaction is proposed to ulti-
mately lead to pathophysiologic alterations in the
intermediate or chronic timeframe, which may result
in manifest adverse health effects (5). Furthermore,
chronic stress may also generate cardiovascular risk
factors on its own, including increased blood pres-
sure, glucose levels, blood viscosity and blood lipids,
and activation of blood coagulation (5), which may
ultimately
lead
to
manifest
CVD.
Interestingly,
emotional stress induced by nighttime aircraft noise
exposure has been associated with stress cardiomy-
opathy (Takotsubo syndrome), a phenomenon that
has been linked to excessive stress hormone release
(6). Noise-induced annoyance has been proposed to
act as an important effect modifier of the relationship
between noise exposure and arterial hypertension (7)
and ischemic coronary artery disease (8). In addition,
high levels of environmental noise have been asso-
ciated with mental health problems, such as depres-
sion and anxiety (9), conditions that are known to
adversely affect cardiovascular function (10).
The molecular mechanisms behind the association
between noise and vascular damage and CVD are not
completely understood. It has been proposed that
chronic stress reactions, by activation of the auto-
nomic nervous system and increased levels of circu-
lating cortisol (discussed previously) (4,5,11,12), may
lead to vascular (endothelial) dysfunction, mainly
through induction of oxidative stress (13,14) and
subsequent activation of prothrombotic pathways
and vascular inflammation (15). In addition to endo-
thelial
dysfunction,
elevated
blood
pressure,
dyslipidemia, changes in blood glucose levels, and
altered heart rate variability could contribute to CVD
development
or
progression.
Importantly,
these
pathophysiologic mechanisms are potentially
not mutually exclusive, and may be active at
different
points
in
time
following
noise
exposure, and vary in importance in relation
to chronicity of exposure.
ADVERSE CARDIOVASCULAR EFFECTS
OF NOISE IN HUMANS
Translational
studies
addressing
associations
be-
tween noise and vascular (endothelial) function are
rare. In a recent field study, we found that simulated
nocturnal aircraft noise was associated with endo-
thelial dysfunction and decreased sleep quality (14).
Importantly, endothelial dysfunction was markedly
improved by acute administration of the antioxidant
vitamin C, indicating that increased production of
reactive oxygen species and/or depletion of antioxi-
dant defense significantly contributes to this phe-
nomenon.
The
associations
between
noise
and
endothelial function were found substantially more
pronounced
if
the
subject
had
been
previously
exposed to noise (priming effect). This indicates that
the vasculature is rather sensitized than desensitized
to vascular damage in response to repeated noise

 exposures. Noise-induced vascular dysfunction was
found paralleled by increased levels of adrenaline.
Furthermore, the negative association between noise
and endothelial function was more pronounced in
patients with established coronary artery disease
(Figure
1)
(13).
Importantly,
no
correlation
was
observed between noise sensitivity or annoyance,
suggesting that endothelial function deteriorates in
response
to
nighttime
noise,
independently
of
whether there is an annoyance reaction or not (13).
The
study
also
found
that
simulated
nighttime
aircraft noise was associated with an increase in blood
pressure.
Thus,
our
observational
studies
may
explain at least in part the results of the HYENA
(Hypertension and Exposure to Noise Near Airports)
study, which found a statistically significant associa-
tion between nighttime aircraft noise and blood
pressure (16). Associations between road traffic noise
and CVD were found stronger among people sleeping
with open windows or with bedroom facing the road
(17). Nighttime noise may interfere with blood pres-
sure dipping and thereby increase cardiovascular risk
(18). Endothelial dysfunction was also observed in
people working 24-h shifts (19) and in people exposed
to chronic sleep restriction (20), suggesting that
nighttime noise–induced sleep deprivation and frag-
mentation
may
be
an
important
branch
on
the
mechanistic pathway between noise exposure and
endothelial dysfunction and CVD (21,22).
Importantly,
endothelial
dysfunction
has
been
demonstrated to have prognostic value in patients
with peripheral artery disease, arterial hypertension,
acute coronary syndrome, or chronic stable coronary
artery disease (23). Thus, noise-induced endothelial
dysfunction may partly explain the association be-
tween transportation noise and CVD found in various
epidemiological studies (24,25).
ADVERSE CARDIOVASCULAR EFFECTS OF
NOISE IN ANIMALS
Noise in animal housing facilities is a major problem
in
animal
studies,
because
it
impacts
hearing,
behavior, and physiology in mice (26). The challenge
with this known confounder of animal studies be-
comes even more complex by variations in noise
susceptibility of different animal species, strains, and
their hearing frequencies. Nevertheless, effects of
noise on animal (e.g., mice) blood pressure, vascular
function, stress hormones, immune reactions, wound
healing, body weight, fertility, and reproduction are
well documented (27). Mechanistic studies in ani-
mals,
however,
addressing
associations
between
noise exposure and vascular (endothelial) function
and cardiovascular risk are rare. Noise exposure of
monkeys (85 dB[A]), intermittent for 9 months) had
no effects on the auditory system, but significantly
increased blood pressure by 30 mm Hg (28). Other
studies established that white noise exposure of rats
for periods of 2 to 8 weeks (85 to 100 dB[A]) signifi-
cantly impaired endothelium-dependent vasodilation
(measured
by
acetylcholine
in
thoracic
aorta
or
mesenteric arterial rings), increased the sensitivity to
the vasoconstrictor serotonin, decreased the lumen
sizes of microvessels, increased systolic blood pres-
sure by 25 to 37 mm Hg and increased circulating
markers of oxidative stress (29–32).
White noise exposure in the range of 70 to 100
dB(A) has been associated with increased levels of
stress hormone, lipid peroxidation, and morpholog-
ical changes in the heart of rats (33), and structural
changes of the vasculature that were corrected by the
antioxidant
vitamin
E
(34).
Chronic
white
noise
exposure
(100
dB[A])
also
induced
an
intestinal
inflammatory response in rats, with a persistent
elevation of IgA, interleukin-1b, and tumor necrosis
factor-a levels. Thus, chronic noise exposure may
directly or indirectly regulate gut microbiota–host
inflammation homeostasis (35).
We recently developed an animal model for expo-
sure of mice to aircraft noise events, with a maximum
sound pressure level of 83 dB(A) and a mean sound
pressure level of 72 dB(A). Our aim was to study the
nonauditory effects of noise on the cardiovascular
system, inflammation, and oxidative stress (24). Ef-
fects of continuous (24 h) aircraft noise exposure for
1, 2, and 4 days were compared with “white noise” as
a control noise exposure, using exactly the same

 average sound pressure level as for aircraft noise. The
key findings were that aircraft noise was associated
with increased blood pressure, endothelial dysfunc-
tion,
reduced
vascular
nitric
oxide
formation,
increased oxidative stress marker, and increased
sensitivity
of the vasculature
to vasoconstrictors
(Figure 2). Importantly, these changes were unique
for aircraft noise and not observed in response to
white noise exposure (applied in the form of a
continuous swoosh) (24), suggesting that the charac-
teristics of the noise stimulus (pattern, frequency,
exposure time, and intensity) are important. Next-
generation sequencing analysis showed that aortic
tissues from aircraft noise–treated animals displayed
significant changes of genes partly responsible for the
regulation of vascular function, vascular remodeling,
and cell death (24). A summary of the main mecha-
nistic pathways including gene regulatory networks is
provided at the end of this review and displayed in
the Central Illustration.
EPIDEMIOLOGICAL EVIDENCE ON NOISE AND CVD
The quantity of epidemiological papers on traffic
noise and CVD is rapidly growing, especially in recent
years. At the same time, the research quality has
increased considerably, with much larger study pop-
ulations and increased focus on adjustment for air
pollution. This has resulted in further evidence of
traffic noise as a risk factor for major cardiovascular
outcomes, such as coronary heart disease (25,36), and
indicated that traffic noise may also be associated
with major CVD not investigated previously in a noise
context (37,38).
NOISE AND CVD. Since publishing of the first study in
the late 1980s, the association between traffic noise
and coronary heart disease has been studied exten-
sively. Recent meta-analyses consistently conclude
that traffic noise is associated with increased risk of
coronary heart disease (25,36). The most recent meta-
analysis from 2015 included studies on road traffic
and aircraft noise, and found a 6% significant increase
in risk for every 10 dB(A) increase in traffic noise (day-
evening-night equivalent noise level A-weighted),
starting as low as 50 dB(A) (25). Importantly, the meta-
analysis applied strict quality criteria with regard to
design, including only incident studies. The meta-
analysis also found that the increase in risk remained
relatively unchanged after excluding studies that did
not account for smoking habits, indicating that life-
style factors may not always be strong confounders in
studies of traffic noise and CVD. Also, cohort studies
with full adjustment for socioeconomic status, life-
style, and air pollution generally find noise to be
significantly associated with coronary heart disease
(39,40). Although house prices are known to be nega-
tively associated with traffic noise, studies have indi-
cated that the association between traffic noise and
socioeconomic status may not always be pronounced,
because living in city centers of large metropolitan
areas is popular, attracting residents with high socio-
economic status (41,42).
In 2011, a large cohort study found a 14% signifi-
cant higher risk of incident stroke for every 10 dB(A)
increase
in
road
traffic
noise
(day-evening-night
equivalent noise level A-weighted) (43). As for coro-
nary heart disease, this risk increase was indepen-
dent of adjustment for air pollution. This result was
later confirmed by 2 large studies from London on
aircraft (44) and road traffic noise (45). Both daytime
and nighttime aircraft noise above 55 dB(A) signifi-
cantly increased risk for stroke hospitalization with,
respectively, 8% and 29% when compared with levels
below 50 dB(A) in a population of 3.6 million people
living around Heathrow airport (44), which suggests
that nighttime noise may be especially hazardous.
Similarly, based on 8.6 million residents of London,
road traffic noise was found to significantly increase
risk for stroke hospitalization (45). In further sup-
port, recent large population-based studies showed
that traffic noise from roads and aircrafts was asso-
ciated with higher stroke mortality (38,44,45). Two
studies have addresses different subtypes of stroke,
and
both
found
traffic
noise
to
be
associated
with ischemic stroke and not hemorrhagic stroke
(38,46), which is as expected given the potential
mechanisms.
Traffic noise may also result in heart failure and
atrial fibrillation (37,38,47). Two large population
studies of 0.75 and 4.41 million persons, respectively,
found both road traffic and aircraft noise to signifi-
cantly increase risk for heart failure, ranging from 2%
to 7% increase in risk per 10-dB(A) rise, depending on
study and type of exposure (38,47). Furthermore, one
study found that road traffic noise increased risk for
incident atrial fibrillation with 6% for every 10 dB(A),
although this was not independent of adjustment for
air pollution (37). This highlights an important aspect
for road traffic noise, namely the correlation with air
pollution. Several recent studies included adjustment
for air pollution when investigating road traffic noise
and CVD (38,43,45,46,48). Although the relatively
high collinearity between road traffic noise and air
pollution
complicates
the
interpretation,
most
studies find the association between road traffic noise
and CVD to be relatively independent of air pollution,
which is also the conclusion of 2 recent reviews
(42,49). In further support of traffic noise as an

 independent risk factor for CVD, aircraft and railway
noise, which correlates much less with air pollution
than road traffic noise, have also been associated with
increased risk for CVD (38,44).
NOISE AND CARDIOVASCULAR RISK FACTORS. The
most comprehensively studied risk factor for CVD in a
noise
context
is
hypertension. In
2012, a
meta-
analysis of 24 studies showed that a 5-dB(A) rise in
road traffic noise was associated with a significant
odds ratio for prevalent hypertension of 1.034 (50).
The
meta-analysis
was
based
on
cross-sectional
studies, which limits the interpretation regarding
causality. However, studies on incident hypertension
are emerging, largely showing that traffic noise is
associated with hypertension, thereby supporting the
cross-sectional findings (51–53). Also, stronger asso-
ciations with hypertension have been observed for
indoor noise as compared with outdoor noise (54). In
further
support,
a
large
population
study
found
aircraft, railway, and road traffic noise to be associ-
ated with hypertensive heart disease (47). An impor-
tant tool when evaluating causality is intervention
studies. But for noise and CVD such studies are rare,
as evidenced by a recent World Health Organization
review, identifying only 4 relevant studies of noise
and CVD (55) (Figure 3). These were all cross-sectional
hypertension studies, and although 3 studies indi-
cated changes with a quiet side, the last study found
no effect.
Other important biologic risk factors for CVD have
also been associated with exposure to traffic noise. In
2014, nighttime road traffic noise was found to
significantly increase the thoracic aortic calcification
burden, a recognized marker of atherosclerosis, by
3.9% for every 5-dB(A) increase, among 4,800 par-
ticipants (48). Also, road traffic noise was signifi-
cantly associated with increased heart rate in a cohort
of 88,000 persons (56) and the total number of noise
events during the night, but not during daytime, has
been
associated
with
arterial
stiffness
(57).
In
contrast,
associations
between
traffic
noise
and
blood lipids and high-sensitive C-reactive protein
were found to disappear after adjustment for air
pollution (58).
Recently, several studies have almost consistently
found associations between aircraft and road traffic
noise and obesity, a major risk factor for CVD, in
cross-sectional
and
longitudinal
studies
of
high
quality (59–62). Furthermore, 3 cohort studies found
traffic noise to significantly increase diabetes risk
(63–65), and a recent study of 62,000 persons found
road traffic noise associated with higher levels of
fasting glucose (58). As a consequence of stress and
sleep disturbance, noise may affect other lifestyle
risk factors, as indicated by recent studies showing
that
traffic
noise
was
associated
with
physical
inactivity (66,67) and possibly smoking and alcohol
consumption (68).

 In conclusion, more and more large studies of high
quality find that traffic noise is associated with cor-
onary heart disease and stroke, as well as with major
risk factors for CVD, most importantly hypertension
and metabolic disease.
MITIGATION STRATEGIES. High exposure to trans-
portation noise is frequent in modern societies, with
more than 30% of the European population being
exposed to residential day-evening-night equivalent
noise level A-weighted levels above 55 dB(A) (69)
(Figure 3). This leads to a considerable increase in
incidence and mortality of major CVD (69), and
therefore development of mitigation strategies is
highly important. A large number of different noise
abatement approaches are available, as recently sum-
marized by the European Commission (Table 1) (70).
Noise
insulation
of
buildings
is
effective
in
reducing exposure to all outdoor noise sources, but is
associated with low cost-effectiveness because of
high costs of implementation. New technologies and
improvements
are
important
contributions
in
reducing noise levels for all transportation noise
sources (e.g., development of quieter engines, low-
noise tires for vehicles, and low-noise brake blocks
for trains). Road traffic is by far the greatest contrib-
utor to traffic noise pollution, and frequently used
abatement procedures are reduced speed limits, quiet
road surfaces, and noise barriers along major roads.
However, because of the extent and the temporal
increase in exposure, other strategies, such as traffic
management and regulation and development of low-
noise tires, are greatly needed. Air transport has
increased for many years, and strategies for reducing
exposure include restriction or curfew during night,
where
noise
has
been
shown
to
be
especially
hazardous
(13,48,51).
However,
exposure
during
morning, daytime, and evening is also detrimental to
health, and other strategies are needed (e.g., chang-
ing the descent procedure and limiting running of
engines on the ground) (70).
Thus, because the percentage of the population
exposed to detrimental levels of transportation noise
is rising, new developments and legislation to reduce
noise are important for public health.
POTENTIAL (MOLECULAR) MECHANISMS UNDERLYING
NOISE-INDUCED CVD. Based on the epidemiological
evidence and mechanistic insight from translational
human and animal data, we propose that noise in-
duces a stress response, characterized by activation of
the sympathetic system and increased levels of cate-
cholamines, cortisone, and angiotensin-II, which ini-
tiates
sequelae,
ultimately
leading
to
vascular
damage (Central Illustration) (5). Angiotensin II is a
potent
activator
of
the
vascular
and
phagocytic
NADPH oxidase, which can lead to oxidative stress in
the blood and the vasculature. Reactive oxygen spe-
cies scavenge nitric oxide and cause endothelial nitric
oxide synthase (eNOS) uncoupling through oxidation
of the eNOS cofactor tetrahydrobiopterin and eNOS
S-glutathionylation,
thereby
further
increasing
vascular oxidative stress (71). At the level of gene
regulation, reactive oxygen species impair signaling
pathways
centered
around
phosphatidylinositol
3-kinase/protein kinase B, the Forkhead box O tran-
scription factors, transforming growth factor-b1, and
nuclear factor-kB, all of which lead to activation of
the endothelin-1 system, increased levels of circu-
lating
interleukin-6,
and
higher
expression
of
vascular adhesion molecules. Oxidative stress goes
hand in hand with increased inflammation (72). Im-
mune cells (neutrophils, natural killer cells, and
monocytes/macrophages) produce higher amounts of
superoxide and nitric oxide on infiltration into the
vasculature ultimately leading to oxidative protein
modifications, such as 3-nitrotyrosine, malondialde-
hyde, and 4-hydroxynonenal, and adverse redox-
regulatory effects on cellular signaling pathways.
Higher circulating and tissue glucocorticoid levels
contribute to a further reduction of endothelial nitric
oxide production, marked impairment of vasodila-
tion,
and
increased
blood
pressure.
Constrictive
pathways are activated by the increased levels of
catecholamines and endothelin-1 as well as cross-
activation by glucocorticoids. The adverse vascular
alterations may contribute to the development of
arterial hypertension, coronary artery disease, heart
failure, and metabolic disorders (Central Illustration).

Noise and Cardiovascular Disease

 SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
The
presented
evidence
further
strengthens
the
concept that transportation noise per se contributes
to the development of cardiovascular risk of coronary
artery disease, arterial hypertension, stroke, and
heart failure.
With regard to understanding the pathophysio-
logical mechanisms, a growing body of evidence finds
that noise is associated with oxidative stress, vascular
dysfunction, autonomic imbalance, and metabolic
abnormalities,
potentiating
not
only
the
adverse
impact of cardiovascular risk factors, such as arterial
hypertension and diabetes, but also contributing to
the progression of atherosclerosis and increased sus-
ceptibility to cardiovascular events.
Thus, there is increasing rationale for studying
the interaction between this novel risk factor and
its collective impact on cardiometabolic diseases.
The questions that need to be addressed are many
and
include
the
magnitude
and
time
course
of
response to coexposure of noise and air pollution;
synergistic effects of both exposures on surrogate
measures, such as blood pressure and metabolic
risk;
duration
of
effect/time
course
of
reversal;
impact of low-grade background noise exposure on
air
pollution
exposure
effects
and
vice
versa;
impact
of
noise
on
the
circadian
rhythm;
and
finally the effects on lifestyle (e.g., diet, stress, and
exercise).
