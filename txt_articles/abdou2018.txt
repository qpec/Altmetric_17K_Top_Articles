Memories are integrated into interconnected networks; nevertheless, each memory has its own
identity. How the brain defines specific memory identity out of intermingled memories stored
in a shared cell ensemble has remained elusive. We found that after complete retrograde
amnesia of auditory fear conditioning in mice, optogenetic stimulation of the auditory inputs
to the lateral amygdala failed to induce memory recall, implying that the memory engram
no longer existed in that circuit. Complete amnesia of a given fear memory did not affect
another linked fear memory encoded in the shared ensemble. Optogenetic potentiation or
depotentiation of the plasticity at synapses specific to one memory affected the recall of
only that memory.Thus, the sharing of engram cells underlies the linkage between memories,
whereas synapse-specific plasticity guarantees the identity and storage of individual memories.
M
emories are formed through long-term
changes in synaptic efficacy, a process
known as synaptic plasticity (1–7), and
are stored in the brain in specific neuro-
nal ensembles called engram cells, which
are reactivated during memory retrieval (8–13).
When two memories are associated, cell ensem-
bles corresponding to each memory overlap
(14–19) and are responsible for the association
(18). Although multiple associated memories can
be encoded in the overlapping population of
cells, each memory has its own identity (14, 18).
Synaptic plasticity is essential for the retrieval,
but not the storage, of associative fear memories
(5, 20, 21). However, how the brain defines the iden-
tity of a particular memory amid the many mem-
ories stored in the same ensemble has been elusive.
We asked whether individual memories stored
in a shared neuronal ensemble would maintain
their identities and have a different fate if one
memory was erased by complete retrograde am-
nesia. We subjected mice to auditory fear con-
ditioning (AFC), in which a tone was associated
with a foot shock. This association is mediated
by synaptic plasticity between neuron termi-
nals of the auditory cortex (AC) and the medial
part of the medial geniculate nucleus (MGm)
and neurons of the lateral amygdala (LA) (22).
Two different tones, at 2 and 7 kHz, were used.
Mice discriminated between the two tones and
showed a freezing response only to the 7-kHz
tone that was paired with shock (figs. S1 and S2).
To completely erase memories, we used au-
tophagy, which is a major protein degradation
pathway wherein the autophagosome sequesters
a small portion of the cytoplasm and fuses with
the endosome-lysosome system to degrade the
entrapped contents. Autophagy contributes to
synaptic plasticity (23, 24), and its induction by
the peptide tat-beclin enhances destabilization
of synaptic efficacy after reactivation of these
synapses through the degradation of endocytosed
a-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic
acid receptors (25, 26). When tat-beclin is com-
bined with inhibition of protein synthesis after
memory retrieval, complete retrograde amnesia
is induced through enhanced memory destabili-
zation and reconsolidation inhibition (25).
To optogenetically manipulate specific memo-
ries, we used c-Fos::tTA transgenic mice; we in-
jected adeno-associated virus (AAV) expressing
Cre recombinase under the control of tetracycline-
responsive element (TRE) in combination with
AAV encoding DIO-oChIEF-citrine, downstream
of the human synapsin (hSyn) 1 promoter, into
the AC and MGm (both of which relay auditory
information to the LA) to label the activated en-
semble with a channelrhodopsin variant, oChIEF
(Fig. 1, A to D, and fig. S2). Mice were trained
with AFC (7-kHz tone plus shock) 2 days after
doxycycline withdrawal (OFF DOX). One day
later, under the ON DOX condition, the LAs of
these mice were infused with phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS), anisomycin, or anisomycin com-
bined with tat-beclin (Ani+tBC) immediately
after the test session (day 5). The anisomycin in-
fusion induced partial retrograde amnesia, whereas
Ani+tBC accomplished complete amnesia, with
the freezing level comparable to that of non-
shocked and unpaired control groups (Fig. 1E).
Optogenetic activation of the axonal terminals of
the AC and MGm engram cells in the LA induced
fear memory recall in the PBS and anisomycin
groups, which is consistent with a previous study
(21), whereas it failed to do this in the Ani+tBC-
treated mice (Fig. 1F).
To further confirm memory erasure, we tried
to recover the erased memories by using optical
long-term potentiation (LTP). High-frequency op-
tical stimulation of the terminals of AC and MGm
engram cells to the LA led to long-lasting poten-
tiated field responses (fig. S3, A and B). Optical
LTP allowed anisomycin-treated mice to com-
pletely recover from amnesia to the PBS group’s
freezing level, which was specific to the 7-kHz
conditioned tone (i.e., it did not generalize to the
2-kHz tone) (Fig. 1G). In the Ani+tBC-treated
mice, optical LTP failed to completely recover the
fear memory; these mice showed only a slight
increase in the freezing level, which was similar
to that which occurred in the unpaired control
group (Fig. 1G). Because the unpaired condition-
ing did not form an associative fear memory, this
slight increase in the freezing response might be
attributed to the formation of a new artificial
associative memory, rather than restoration of a
previously stored associative memory.
In a remote memory test, the Ani+tBC group
displayed significantly lower freezing than the
anisomycin or PBS groups in both natural cue
and optogenetic tests, indicating that memory
erasure was long-lasting and that the memory
did not undergo spontaneous recovery over time
(Fig. 1, H and I). The Ani+tBC-treated mice that
received LTP showed light-induced freezing com-
parable to that of the PBS group (test 9), excluding
the possibility of LA damage from Ani+tBC
treatment. Furthermore, similar results were ob-
tained when engram cells in the LA were labeled
and manipulated similarly but optical (instead of
tone) recall was used (fig. S4).
To examine the synaptic mechanism underlying
the complete retrograde amnesia, we conducted a
LTPocclusionexperiment,inwhichartificialinduc-
tion of LTP was occluded in circuits with potenti-
ated synapses, whereas it was facilitated in circuits
withunpotentiatedsynapses(27–29).High-frequency
optical stimulation 1 day after test 1 induced LTP
in the Ani+tBC group that was comparable to that
in the nonshock group but significantly higherthan
that in the PBS and anisomycin groups (Fig. 2, A to
D). Thus, synaptic plasticity was totally reset and
returned to nonshock levels after complete amnesia.
This conclusion was further supported by
analysis of functional connectivity. Using
c-Fos::tTA/R26R::H2B-mCherry double transgenic
mice (18), we measured the connectivity pat-
tern between upstream and downstream engram
cells after memory erasure. Engram cells in the
LA were labeled with Cre-dependent mCherry,
and the axonal terminals of the AC and MGm
engram cells were labeled with oChIEF. The
terminals were optogenetically stimulated at
10 Hz, and the number of cells that were
double-positive for mCherry and c-Fos, which
represented the degree of functional connectivity

decrease in the c-Fos+–mCherry+ overlap in the
Ani+tBC group in comparison with the PBS and
anisomycin groups, which is consistent with the
behavioral data and the total resetting of syn-
aptic efficacy.
Considering that memories are stored in in-
terconnected networks, and the brain can store
two memories in a shared ensemble (14–18), we
examined the effect of complete retrograde am-
nesia of one memory on another memory by
using two different AFC events: a 7-kHz AFC
(event 1) followed by a 2-kHz AFC (event 2) (Fig. 3).
When these two events were separated by 5 hours,
memory for event 2 was enhanced (fig. S5),
indicating interaction between the memories

 (17). The majority of the LA engram cells for
event 1 (mCherry+) also encoded event 2 (c-Fos+),
whereas the memories were encoded in two
distinct populations in the AC (Fig. 3, A to E, and
fig. S7, C to F). When the two memories were
separated by 24 hours, they were allocated to
distinct populations in both the LA and the AC.
We then used the c-Fos::tTA transgenic mice
to label the neural ensembles in the AC and MGm
thatwereactivatedspecificallyduringevent1with
oChIEF (Fig. 3F and fig. S6). After 5 hours ON
DOX, mice were exposed to event 2 and then
divided into two groups. The first group received
PBS after event 1 memory retrieval and Ani+tBC
after event 2 memory retrieval (gp1), whereas the
second group received the opposite treatment
(gp2). In gp1, memory of event 2 was erased by
Ani+tBC (test 4), whereas memory of event 1 was
not affected (test 2). In contrast, in gp2, event
1 memory was erased (test 2), whereas event
2 memory was not affected (test 4; Fig. 3G).
Moreover, optogenetic stimulation of the pre-
synaptic terminals of the AC and MGm engram
cells corresponding to event 1 memory induced a
freezing response in gp1, but not in gp2, although
in both groups, the LA neurons storing both asso-
ciative memories underwent Ani+tBC treatment
(Fig. 3H). These results reveal synapse-specific
engram erasure and indicate that memories
stored in the shared engram cells are synapse-
specific and have different fates (Fig. 3I).
We then addressed the question of how each
memory reserves its individual identity within
the shared ensemble. We carried out a loss-of-
function experiment using optical long-term
depression (LTD) to depotentiate the synaptic
efficacy in synapses specific for event 1 memory
(fig. S3, A and C, and Fig. 4, A and B). In com-
parison with a control group, mice that received
LTD showed impairment in event 1 memory
recall, but not in event 2 memory recall (Fig. 4C).
Optogenetic stimulation to the terminals of the
AC and MGm ensemble of event 1 memory
triggered freezing in the control group, whereas
it failed to trigger freezing in the LTD group,
despite the fact that event 2 memory was intact
(Fig. 4D). Thus, selective depotentiation of synap-
tic plasticity deconstructs the specific connectivity
between engram assemblies, thereby erasing one
memory without disrupting the other memory in
the same population of neurons.
Last, a gain-of-function experiment was per-
formed in which both memories were erased
with Ani+tBC and then optical LTP was induced

 in event 1 memory–specific synapses (Fig. 4, E
and F). Mice that received the LTP protocol
displayed higher freezing levels in response to
the 7-kHz tone (test 5), whereas freezing re-
sponses to the 2-kHz tone (test 6) were unaffected
(Fig. 4G).
Storing and distinguishing between several
memories encoded in the same neurons are crit-
ically important for organizing unique memories.
Our findings demonstrate that synapse-specific
plasticity is necessary and sufficient for associative
fear memory storage and that it guarantees unique-
ness to the memory trace, pointing to plasticity as
a substrate for the fear memory engram. This
perspective is consistent with a recent observation
that LTP is selectively induced in specific auditory
pathways after fear memory formation (20).
Engram cells retain a memory after anisomycin-
inducedamnesia,andsynapticplasticityisdispensable
for memory storage (21). However, synaptic plas-
ticity and functional connectivity between en-
gram cell assemblies are indispensable for fear
memory storage, because after LTD induction,
the depressed synapses might be nonfunctional.
Therefore, not only the natural cue, but also the
optical stimulation of synapses between the en-
gram cell assemblies failed to retrieve the mem-
ory. Furthermore, the engram network no longer
retained the associative fear memory after Ani
+tBC-induced complete amnesia. The LTP occlu-
sion experiment showed that synaptic potentia-
tion persisted even 2 days after behavioral training
in the PBS control group and that complete am-
nesia accompanied a reset of LTP. This further
supports the idea that LTP is important for mem-
ory maintenance. The combined evidence sug-
gests that synaptic plasticity can build a specific
connectivity within the engram cell assemblies
and that the functional connectivity is a simple
reflection of the enhanced synaptic strength,
rather than an independent mechanism for mem-
ory storage.

 This study uncovered the mechanism by which
the brain can maintain the uniqueness of a
massive number of associated memories stored
in shared cell ensembles. Furthermore, we
achieved selective and total erasure of a fear
memory from an engram network without af-
fecting other memories stored in the shared
ensemble by resetting the plasticity in a synapse-
specific manner. These findings lead to a better
understanding of the mechanisms underlying
memory storage and may give insight into ther-
apeutic approaches to treating post-traumatic
stress disorder.
