Abstract
Smoking during pregnancy is a leading preventable cause of poor pregnancy outcomes and 
immediate and longer-term adverse health outcomes among exposed offspring. Developing more 
effective smoking-cessation interventions for pregnant women has been a public-health priority for 
more than thirty years. We review developments over the past three years (2012–15) on the use of 
financial incentives to promote smoking cessation among pregnant women. We searched the 
literature for reports on primary and secondary analyses and reviews of controlled trials on this 
topic published in peer-reviewed journals using the search engine PubMed, reviewed 
bibliographies of published articles, and consulted expert colleagues. The search revealed several 
important developments, with the following three being especially noteworthy. First, the review 
identified four new randomized controlled trials, three of which further supported the efficacy of 
this treatment approach. One of the three trials supporting efficacy also included the first 
econometric analysis of this treatment approach showing financial incentives with pregnant 
smokers to be highly cost-effective. Second, two Cochrane reviews were published during this 3-
year period covering the more recent and earlier efficacy trials. Meta-analyses in both reviews 
supported the efficacy of the approach. Lastly, the first effectiveness trial was reported 
demonstrating that financial incentives increased abstinence rates above control levels when 
implemented by obstetrical clinic staff in a large urban hospital working with community tobacco 
interventionists. Overall, there is a growing and compelling body of evidence supporting the 
efficacy and cost-effectiveness of financial incentives for smoking cessation among pregnant 
women.

Introduction
Cigarette smoking during pregnancy continues to represent a serious public health problem. 
While prevalence of smoking during pregnancy has decreased over time in developed 
countries that progress has been unevenly distributed with economically disadvantaged 
pregnant women continuing to smoke at much higher rates than more affluent women [1,2]. 
Also concerning is evidence suggesting that prevalence of smoking during pregnancy may 
be increasing in low- and middle-income countries [3,4]. Smoking during pregnancy causes 
numerous and serious maternal and infant adverse health effects, including catastrophic 
pregnancy complications and adverse effects on fetal development that a growing body of 
evidence suggests compromise health and increase disease risk throughout the lifespan [5–
10]. Smoking during pregnancy also has serious adverse economic impacts. In the United 
States (U.S.), for example, costs related only to the delivery for smoke-exposed neonates 
were estimated at $122 million annually in 2004 dollars [11]. While that cost alone is 
concerning, the emerging evidence on the longer-term adverse health effects of in utero 
smoke exposure suggest that the economic impacts are considerably larger than was 
envisioned even just a few years ago.
Efforts to develop effective cessation interventions for this population have been ongoing 
since the mid 1980s, involving more than 77 controlled trials and 29,000 women [4]. Meta-
analyses of this large literature have shown that financial incentives produce the largest 
effect sizes by several orders of magnitude compared to pharmacological or other 
psychosocial interventions investigated in controlled studies with this population [4,12]. The 
purpose of the present report is to review and discuss developments during the past 3 years 
(2012–2015) related to the use of financial incentives for smoking cessation during 
pregnancy.
Before turning to this more recent literature, however, it is important to place this area of 
treatment development into a broader context that is too often ignored. Use of financial 
incentives in the form of vouchers exchangeable for retail items, cash, or other monetary 
incentives to change health-related behavior began during the U.S. cocaine epidemic of the 
1980s and 90s when controlled trials showed them to be highly efficacious with outpatient 
cocaine dependent individuals when virtually all other treatments investigated with that 
population were failing miserably [13,14]. Thereafter, a large body of experimental evidence 
began accumulating in the form of rigorously controlled experimental studies and meta-
analyses supporting the efficacy of this treatment approach (referred to as contingency 
management in the substance abuse field) for reducing use of a wide range of different 
abused drugs including cocaine, marijuana, methamphetamine, opioids, and tobacco—as 
well as other health-related behaviors [15]. A programmatic series of literature reviews on 
the use of financial incentives with substance use disorders provide a continuous record from

 the seminal reports through the present [16–18]. Between 1991 and 2015, 177 controlled 
studies were published in peer-reviewed journals examining the efficacy of systematically 
delivered vouchers or related monetary incentives for reducing drug use (vast majority of 
studies) or increasing adherence with other treatment regimens such as clinic attendance or 
medication adherence. Results in 88% (156/177) of those studies demonstrated efficacy. Put 
simply, there is an enormous experimental literature demonstrating that systematically 
delivered financial incentives effectively reduce drug use and improve other therapeutic 
targets. Also important to note is that there are basic methodological components to an 
effective incentive program [19]. Often these components are not included in community 
wide incentive programs and as such that literature should be considered separately as is 
being done in recent reviews [20].
Methods
We reviewed the literature between 2012–15 using (1) PubMed, the search engine of the 
U.S. National Library of Medicine, and search terms “financial incentives,” “pregnant 
women,” and “cigarette smoking,” (2) reference sections of published reports, and (3) 
consultation with expert colleagues. The review was limited to full reports (not abstracts) of 
main findings from controlled studies published in peer-reviewed journals examining the 
efficacy or effectiveness of financial incentives for smoking cessation among pregnant 
women and secondary analyses from those trials. Reviewing the time period of 2012–15 
dovetails well with an earlier review of this literature that covered contributions through 
2011 [21]. Among the articles reviewed are two Cochrane reviews that were published 
during the 2012–15 time period (4, 20).
Results
Efficacy Testing
Results from four randomized controlled efficacy trials were published during 2012–15 [22–
25]. We comment on each below. These four efficacy trials are accompanied by six others 
published between 2000–2011 for a total of ten controlled efficacy trials (Table).
Tuten et al. (2012) trial [22]—This trial is seminal in extending this treatment approach 
to opioid-dependent pregnant smokers. This is an especially important subgroup to 
investigate as cigarette smoking likely exacerbates the already considerable adverse neonatal 
health outcomes and hospital costs related to in utero opioid exposure [26].
As detailed in the Table, 102 methadone-maintained pregnant cigarette smokers were 
randomly assigned to one of three 12-week treatment conditions: (1) incentives delivered 
contingent on predetermined reductions in breath carbon monoxide (CO) levels; (2) 
incentives delivered independent of smoking status; (3) usual care. Incentive values started 
at a relatively low value, escalated in value with each consecutive negative toxicology test 
result, and reset back to lower values for positive test results. A notable modification in this 
incentives intervention was rather than target complete abstinence starting at the quit date, 
incentives were provided for graded reductions relative to baseline breath CO levels: any 
reduction (week 1); 10% reduction (weeks 2–4), 25% reduction (weeks 5–7), 50% reduction

 (weeks 8–9), 75% reduction (week 10–11); complete abstinence (CO<4ppm) (week 12 until 
delivery).
The results were quite encouraging. Women in the incentives condition submitted 
significantly lower mean CO values than those in both control conditions over the course of 
the intervention. Approximately one-third (31%) of women in the incentives condition met 
the abstinence target of breath CO ≤ 4 ppm at week 12 compared to none of the women in 
the control conditions. Mean incentive earnings in the incentive condition across the 12-
week intervention were $156.85 ± 30.7. No significant differences in birth outcomes or 
postpartum abstinence levels were noted.
The overwhelming majority of opioid-dependent pregnant women smoke and evidence 
suggests numerous potential neonatal health benefits and cost reductions might follow from 
getting them to quit [26]. These encouraging results with incentives for smoking cessation 
among pregnant opioid-dependent women are also consistent with recent positive outcomes 
with incentives for smoking cessation in non-pregnant opioid-dependent populations [27].
Ondersma et al. (2012) trial [23]—This trial was designed to provide a technology-
based smoking-cessation intervention that could be delivered with minimal effort and as part 
of routine obstetrical care. As detailed in the Table, 110 pregnant smokers were randomly 
assigned to one of four treatment conditions in an 8-week trial: (1) treatment as usual; (2) an 
interactive computer-delivered brief intervention based on the 5As that includes a 4–6 min 
professionally produced video wherein an obstetrician advises women to quit smoking 
accompanied by testimonials from women who have done so; (3) an incentives intervention 
wherein women could ask to have their smoking status tested at routine prenatal care visits 
up to a maximum of 5 times with a minimum of 1 week between tests; those with a breath 
CO ≤ 4 ppm could earn $50/negative test; (3) combined computer-delivered brief 
intervention plus the incentives.
No significant differences between treatment conditions were noted in biochemically 
verified 7-day point prevalence smoking abstinence (8.7%, 30.4%, 9.1%, and 19.2% for 
usual care, CD-based 5As only, incentives only, CD-based 5As plus incentives, respectively; 
the CD-based 5As was reported to have a higher percentage of cotinine-negative urine 
toxicology tests at that 8-week assessment than the three other treatment conditions (17.4%, 
43.5%, 13.6%, and 15.4% for usual care, CD-based 5As only, incentives only, CD-based 
5As plus incentives, respectively).
There are several peculiar aspects to these results including the much larger-than-expected 
positive response to the 5As. Leaving the timing of smoking-status testing and other aspects 
of engaging with the incentive program unstructured and up to the discretion of the women 
is unprecedented and may have undermined efficacy by fostering procrastination or perhaps 
ambiguity about the purpose of the incentive program. To our knowledge, the unusually high 
success obtained with the CD-delivered version of the 5As in this trial remains to be 
replicated.

 Higgins et al. (2014) trial [24]—This trial was designed to examine whether outcomes 
achieved with a previously validated schedule of voucher-based financial incentives 
intervention (see trials by Heil et al. [27] and Higgins et al. [30] in Table) could be improved 
without increasing overall costs. To accomplish that goal, the schedule of potential earnings 
was modified so that higher value incentives were available earlier in the quit attempt. 
Abstinence in the initial weeks of a quit attempt is a robust predictor of late-pregnancy 
outcomes in this treatment approach [28].
As detailed in the Table, 118 women were randomly assigned to (1) the previously validated 
schedule of incentives delivered contingent on biochemically verified smoking abstinence, 
(2) the revised schedule condition of incentives, or (3) a control condition wherein vouchers 
were provided independent of smoking status. In the previously validated schedule, voucher 
value started at $6.25 for the 1st negative tests and then escalated by $1.25 for each 
consecutive negative test to a maximum of $39.00 where it remained unless there was a 
positive test result. Positive test results reset voucher value to initial low levels; two 
consecutive negative tests following a reset increased voucher values back to the value prior 
to the reset. Testing of smoking status was daily for the 1st five days of the quit attempt, 
tapered gradually over the antepartum period, increased in frequency again in initial weeks 
postpartum and then tapered again until incentives were finally terminated at the end of 
week 12. The frequency and schedule of testing remained the same in the revised schedule 
as did total possible earnings. What changed was potential earnings in the initial 6 weeks of 
the intervention were increased by a total of approximately $300 by reducing values 
available later in the intervention period.
Both incentive schedules increased the primary outcome of late-pregnancy 7-day point 
prevalence abstinence rates above control levels by two-fold or more (Table), but there were 
no significant schedule differences in that regard. The two incentive conditions also differed 
from controls but not each other in the overall percentage of all antepartum negative 
toxicology tests for smoking. The usual incentive schedule but not the revised schedule 
significantly increased fetal growth above control levels in serial ultrasound testing, 
replicating results from a prior trial using that same incentive schedule [29]. No significant 
differences between treatment conditions were noted in birth outcomes or postpartum 
abstinence rates. Women in the revised and previously validated incentive conditions earned 
$557.08 ± 64.54 and $443.65 ± 73.69, respectively, in vouchers, with maximal earnings 
possible being ~$1,180 from the start of prenatal care (~ 10 weeks of gestation) through 12-
weeks postpartum.
The efficacy of both incentive schedules for promoting antepartum smoking abstinence is 
consistent with the results reported in prior trials by this group of investigators [29–31]. 
Moreover, keeping two of the treatment conditions in this trial (usual incentive schedule and 
the non-contingent voucher control condition) largely identical with prior trials has allowed 
for collapsing data across trials for greater power to examine treatment effects on other 
outcomes. That strategy was used in studies demonstrating improvements in birth outcomes 
[32] and breastfeeding duration [33] with the incentives intervention and in the studies 
discussed below examining depressive symptoms and impulsivity [34, 35]. Worth 
mentioning is that trends in the current trial favoring improved birth outcomes among infants

 born to mothers in the usual incentives condition are consistent with those earlier findings, 
although not so with breastfeeding. Tracking such outcomes within and across these trials on 
incentives with pregnant smokers is very important. Lastly, the failure to discern significant 
treatment effects of incentives on abstinence at 12-weeks postpartum in the present trial is 
inconsistent with prior results. Interestingly, the abstinence levels in the two incentive groups 
in this most recent trial are consistent with results reported by this group previously. It is the 
levels in the control group at 12-weeks postpartum that were higher than in the prior studies. 
Abstinence levels among controls dropped off by the 24-week postpartum assessment to 
where results were in the direction of favoring the incentives condition, which aligns well 
with earlier results reported by these investigators and those reported by Tappin et al. [25] 
discussed below.
Tappin et al. (2015) trial [25]—This trial was designed to test the efficacy of this 
incentives approach in (1) a larger study sample to begin assessing how scalable the model is 
and (b) to extend the treatment to populations outside the U.S. (i.e., Glasgow, Scotland). 
Prior trials were conducted in the U.S.
As detailed in the Table, 612 pregnant smokers were randomly assigned to usual care (in-
person appointment to discuss smoking and cessation, free nicotine replacement therapy for 
10 weeks, and four weekly support phone calls) or usual care plus a maximum of £400 (~ 
$603) in voucher-based incentives. An initial incentive (£50) was delivered contingent on 
attending an initial in-person meeting and setting a quit date. Additional incentives (£50, 
£100, and £200, vouchers) were earned for biochemically verified abstinence (breath CO < 
10 ppm) at assessments conducted at 4-, 12-, and 34–38 weeks following the quit date, 
respectively.
The primary outcome was urine-cotinine verified late-pregnancy point prevalence 
abstinence, which was 2.6-fold greater in the incentives than control condition (22.5% vs. 
8.6%). Average vouchers earned in the incentives condition was not reported with the main 
trial results but based on information reported with the economic analysis described below 
was ~£135. There were no significant differences in birth outcomes; a larger percentage of 
women in the incentives compared to the control condition self-reported abstinence from 
smoking at a phone assessment conducted 1-year after the quit date or approximately 24 
weeks postpartum (15% vs. 4%).
This trial provides compelling evidence for the scalability of this treatment approach and its 
generality to populations outside of the U.S. The failure to discern any impact of the 
relatively sizeable antepartum treatment effects on birth outcomes is somewhat perplexing 
and can only be sorted out through further study. It is inconsistent with the pattern of results 
observed in the trials by Higgins and colleagues where improvements in fetal growth and 
birth outcomes have been seen in the incentives condition when analyzed with sufficient 
power by collapsing across trials. The Tappin et al. [25] intervention involves considerably 
less frequent monitoring of antepartum smoking status and reinforcement of abstinence than 
in the Higgins et al [24] model, which could be important in terms of impacting fetal growth 
and birth outcomes.

 Cochrane reviews—As noted above, two reviews were reported during 2012–15 [4, 20]. 
A review by Chamberlain and colleagues [4] covered incentives with pregnant smokers as 
part of a larger review on psychosocial interventions for smoking cessation in that 
population. A more recent review by Cahill and colleagues [20] covered incentives with 
pregnant smokers as part of a larger review on incentives for smoking cessation generally 
and, of course, was more comprehensive. As mentioned above, the Chamberlain et al review 
[4] examining psychosocial interventions with pregnant smokers concluded that incentives 
produced the largest overall treatment effects among the psychosocial interventions 
reviewed, consistent with conclusions in an earlier review [12]. The Cahill et al review [20] 
included 8 of the 10 trials shown in the Table for the present review [22–25,29,30, 35, 36—
31 & one of the two studies in 37 were excluded]. The review supported the efficacy of 
incentives based on late-pregnancy outcomes and the longest follow-up outcomes reported 
which was 24-weeks postpartum in the vast majority of trials. Shown in the Figure are late-
pregnancy outcomes for individual trials and overall based on 1,297 women (675 treated 
with incentives & 622 without incentives). Those treated with incentives had 3.79 (95% CI: 
2.74–525) greater odds of abstaining from smoking than controls. With regard to longest 
follow-up outcomes reported, those treated with incentives had 3.61 (95%CI: 2.60–5.02) 
greater odds of abstaining from smoking than controls.
Effectiveness Studies
Boyd et al. (2015) [39]—This report details what to our knowledge is the seminal 
prospective economic analysis on the use of financial incentives with pregnant smokers 
based on the Tappin et al trial [25] discussed above. The investigators examined incremental 
cost per late pregnancy quitter in the incentives versus usual care treatment conditions. They 
compared results against standardized incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) tables for 
smoking cessation from the general population of smokers [40]. The average incremental 
cost per quitter in the incentives conditions was estimated at £158. With late-pregnancy 
cessation rate of .14 above controls at an incremental cost of £158, the ICER was £1129, 
which fell below the Standardized ICER of £1390 for a 6-month follow-up outcome 
difference of 0.14. They also examined incremental quality adjusted life years (QALY) 
gained using a Markov model designed to simulate the life-time likelihood and impact of 
cessation among those still abstinent at the 6-month postpartum assessment. The incremental 
cost per QALY gained was estimated at £482, which is well below the £20,000–30,000 
standard per QALY gained. While acknowledging the need for further research, the authors 
concluded that financial incentives for smoking cessation in pregnancy are highly cost-
effective.
Ierfino et al. (2015) [41]—A critically important question regarding any new treatment 
approach is whether it will remain effective when moved into clinical practice. To our 
knowledge, this study reported by Ierfino et al. [41] is the first addressing this question 
regarding financial incentives for smoking cessation among pregnant women. These 
investigators implemented the incentives intervention in the obstetrical service of a large 
urban hospital in Chesterfield, England. The intervention was designed to parallel the 
validated schedule outlined above for the Higgins et al (2014) trial [24] in terms of the 
schedule of voucher delivery and maximal potential earnings. Obstetrical service clinic staff

 and the community Stop Smoking Service staff implemented the intervention across about a 
1-year period. Cessation results were compared to historical controls from the prior year.
A total of 2,971 women were screened for smoking, with 615 (21%) testing positive. The 
opportunity to join the study was offered to all smokers, with 239 (39%) accepting. 48 of 
those 239 women (20%) were biochemically verified to be abstinent from smoking from 6 
weeks after the quit date through delivery, and 10% were still abstinent at 6-months 
postpartum. Abstinence among the historical controls was 0% at both assessments. These 
results provide an important and encouraging demonstration that this treatment model can be 
effectively implemented in a community treatment setting.
Potential Moderators of Treatment Response
Lopez et al (2015) [34]—Cigarette smoking is highly associated with depression and 
other mood disorders in the general population [42] and is a risk factor for postpartum 
depression as are a history of prior depression and antepartum depressive symptoms. These 
investigators examined whether the subgroup of pregnant smokers with histories of 
depression or those reporting current depressive symptoms were benefitting from this 
incentives-based smoking cessation intervention.
Women in this study were assigned either to an incentives condition or to a control condition 
wherein they received vouchers of comparable value independent of smoking status. 
Treatments were provided antepartum through 12-weeks postpartum [24, 30–32, 35]. 
Depression ratings (Beck Depression Inventory [BDI]-1A) were examined across 7 
antepartum/postpartum assessments. Women who reported a history of prior depression or 
who had BDI scores ≥ 17 at the start of prenatal care were categorized as depression-prone 
(Dep+), while those meeting neither criterion were categorized as depression-negative (Dep
−).
The intervention increased smoking abstinence independent of depression status 
demonstrating that depression-prone women benefit from the intervention. An unexpected 
but potentially important observation was that the incentives intervention also decreased 
mean postpartum BDI ratings as well as the proportion of women scoring in the clinical 
range compared with the control treatment. These treatment effects on depression ratings 
were specific to the Dep+ women. Similar reductions in psychiatric symptoms among those 
receiving incentive-based treatments have been reported for patients with cocaine use 
disorders [43], and appear to represent another health outcome that is positively impacted by 
this treatment approach among pregnant smokers. To our knowledge, this outcome has not 
yet been examined in other trials on incentives among pregnant and newly postpartum 
smokers but is an important outcome to examine in future trials or to retrospectively 
investigate in previously published trials where depressive symptoms were assessed.
Lopez et al. (2015) [35]—These investigators examined whether individual differences in 
baseline delay discounting moderate response to incentives-based treatment for smoking 
cessation among pregnant smokers. Delay discounting of monetary rewards is a predictor of 
becoming a smoker among women of reproductive age [44] and moderated spontaneous 
quitting upon learning of pregnancy among lighter although not heavier smokers [45].

 The study was conducted in two steps: First, associations between baseline impulsiveness 
and abstinence at late pregnancy and 24-weeks-postpartum were examined as part of a 
component of the Higgins et al. (2014) trial [24] described above (N = 118). Second, to 
increase statistical power, a second analysis was conducted collapsing results across all prior 
trials involving the same study conditions and in which delay discounting was included (N = 
236). Impulsivity was assessed using a delay discounting (DD) of hypothetical monetary 
rewards task in all three trials and Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS) in the most recent trial. 
Analyses were conducted using logistic regression.
Neither DD nor BIS predicted smoking status in the single or combined trials. Receiving 
incentives, lower baseline smoking rate, and a history of quit attempts pre-pregnancy 
predicted greater odds of antepartum abstinence across the single and combined trials. A 
history of quit attempts prior to entering treatment was the only predictor of 24-week 
postpartum abstinence in the single trial. In analyses collapsing across trials where there was 
greater statistical power, having received the incentives intervention was the single 
significant predictor of 24-weeks postpartum abstinence.
Conclusions
There is a robust and compelling body of evidence supporting the efficacy of financial 
incentives in promoting smoking-cessation among pregnant women that is evident at the 
level of individual trials and in three Cochrane meta-analyses [4, 12, 20]. The evidence 
supporting antepartum treatment effects is strikingly positive and highly important in light of 
accumulating evidence regarding the adverse effects of in utero smoke exposure across the 
life span. Evidence for postpartum are not quite as strong as antepartum effects at the level 
of individual trials, overall leave little doubt about efficacy across trials [20, 21]. Where the 
most remains to be learned is efficacy at increasing longer-term maternal cessation rates 
after the incentives have been discontinued. But there too, there is a reasonable amount of 
evidence supporting efficacy out through 24-weeks postpartum, and 12 weeks after 
discontinuation of incentives, when looked at across trials [20, 21]. There is also the larger 
body of evidence mentioned above on the efficacy of incentives for reducing drug use more 
generally that should be considered.
The initial evidence on cost-effectiveness is also positive and encouraging. The Boyd et al. 
[39] study provides critically important evidence that the costs of this incentives treatment 
approach align well with those of similarly effective smoking-cessation interventions already 
in use with the general population of smokers. That observation seems quite straightforward 
and provides a sound basis for moving these interventions into routine care. The longer-term 
estimates regarding maternal QALY gained are more uncertain but nevertheless 
encouraging. We certainly see nothing in them that should give policy makers pause. The 
precision of such estimates will be improved by a more detailed understanding of impacts on 
birth outcomes, breastfeeding duration, postpartum depression risk, and perhaps still 
unknown shorter-term positive health impacts. Characterizing these effects and associated 
costs and benefits needs to be a priority in this area. More precise information on longer-
term maternal cessation outcomes will be important as well. There seems little doubt that 
future trials will address these needs. Perhaps the greatest unknown in terms of a

 comprehensive economic analysis of this treatment model is whether its robust effects on 
antepartum smoking are impacting longer-term health outcomes among the offspring. Does 
this treatment approach protect against the effects of in utero smoke exposure on fetal 
epigenetic profiles and longer term behavioral, neurobiological, metabolic, and 
cardiovascular health risks? If so, what are the associated cost benefits of doing so? We 
anticipate that these are also questions that investigators are likely to begin addressing in the 
near future, especially those relating to epigenetic changes.
The Ierfino et al. trial [41] provides encouraging evidence that the treatment can be 
disseminated into community clinics while retaining clinical effectiveness. That addresses an 
important concern about this treatment model. Moreover, it does so in a manner that 
provides a useful roadmap for other communities to follow. The model of having obstetrical 
clinic staff coordinate with community-supported smoking-cessation interventionists in 
implementing the treatment would seem to have potential to transfer to a broad range of 
communities in developed countries. We know that it does in our home state of Vermont. So 
at a practical level there is now a roadmap on how to move this treatment model into 
implementation.
Will that happen in the near future? Hard to know. Apparently this incentives model is now 
being offered as part of routine care in some parts of Scotland, but we know of no other 
place where that is the case. One has to wonder where the tipping point is on this topic. That 
is, when does the discussion shift from being exclusively focused on what more needs to be 
learned scientifically or economically about this treatment model to why so many 
communities persist in offering inferior care for such a serious and costly public health 
problem when an efficacious and cost-effective alternative is available. Those of us who 
work in this field know that the 0% cessation rates observed over a one-year period among 
historical controls in the Ierfino et al. [41] study are not far off from the dismal success rates 
seen among economically disadvantaged pregnant smokers in most of our communities. The 
seminal paper on incentives with pregnant smokers was published in 2000, which is quickly 
approaching the 17-year average for dissemination of medical advances into routine care 
[46]. By that metric, one might expect the tipping point to be coming soon.
