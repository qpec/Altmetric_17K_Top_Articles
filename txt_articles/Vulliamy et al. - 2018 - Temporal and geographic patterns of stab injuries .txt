AbstrACt
Objectives To describe the epidemiology of assaults 
resulting in stab injuries among young people. We 
hypothesised that there are specific patterns and risk 
factors for injury in different age groups.
Design Eleven-year retrospective cohort study.
setting Urban major trauma centre in the UK.
Participants 1824 patients under the age of 25 years 
presenting to hospital after a stab injury resulting from 
assault.
Outcomes Incident timings and locations were obtained 
from ambulance service records and triangulated 
with prospectively collected demographic and injury 
characteristics recorded in our hospital trauma registry. 
We used geospatial mapping of individual incidents 
to investigate the relationships between demographic 
characteristics and incident timing and location.
results The majority of stabbings occurred in males from 
deprived communities, with a sharp increase in incidence 
between the ages of 14 and 18 years. With increasing age, 
injuries occurred progressively later in the day (r2=0.66, 
p<0.01) and were less frequent within 5 km of home 
(r2=0.59, p<0.01). Among children (age <16), a significant 
peak in injuries occurred between 16:00 and 18:00 hours, 
accounting for 22% (38/172) of injuries in this group 
compared with 11% (182/1652) of injuries in young adults. 
In children, stabbings occurred earlier on school days 
(hours from 08:00: 11.1 vs non-school day 13.7, p<0.01) 
and a greater proportion were within 5 km of home (90% 
vs non-school day 74%, p=0.02). Mapping individual 
incidents demonstrated that the spike in frequency in 
the late afternoon and early evening was attributable to 
incidents occurring on school days and close to home.
Conclusions Age, gender and deprivation status are 
potent influences on the risk of violent injury in young 
people. Stab injuries occur in characteristic temporal 
and geographical patterns according to age group, with 
the immediate after-school period associated with a 
spike in incident frequency in children. This represents 
an opportunity for targeted prevention strategies in this 
population.
IntrODuCtIOn 
Interpersonal violence involving knives is 
a major public health problem.1 Reports of 
high-profile incidents are rarely absent from 
mainstream media, although these represent 
a fraction of the overall incidence. In 2017, 
36 998 offences involving knives or other 
sharp implements were reported in England 
and Wales, a rise of 26% compared with the 
previous year.2 Beyond the immediate physical 
consequences of knife violence, the psycho-
logical and social impact on individuals and 
communities is substantial.3 4 Despite inten-
sive efforts at prevention, the incidence of 
knife crime has increased in recent years.2 5 6 
A detailed understanding of the risk factors 
for stab injury in specific groups is essential to 
inform ongoing preventative initiatives.
Young people are the most frequent victims 
of knife violence.7 Male teenagers from 
deprived communities in urban areas are at 
particularly high risk, with a peak in incidence 
between the ages of 16 and 24 years.1 2 8 Stab 
injuries in children are less common than in 
adolescents, but also predominantly affect 
those living in areas with the highest level 
of socioeconomic deprivation.9 The extent 
strengths and limitations of this study
 
► Large long-term study focusing on an important 
public health issue in age groups at the highest risk 
of knife violence.
 
► Unlike most previous studies on this topic, this study 
combines incident-level data on location and timing 
of assaults with demographic data and clinical out-
comes which allows a detailed analysis of the epi-
demiology of knife violence in specific age groups.
 
► This study does not provide an insight into the pat-
terns of stab injuries over time because of changes 
to the trauma system which occurred during the 
study period.
 
► The generalisability of these findings to other set-
tings and other forms of interpersonal violence may 
be limited.

to which the timing, location and outcomes of stab inju-
ries vary with age is unknown. A detailed breakdown of 
the epidemiology of stab injuries in different age groups 
would identify opportunities for targeted prevention 
measures in individual populations.
The objective of this study was to characterise the epide-
miology of stab injuries among different age groups. We 
hypothesised that stabbings in children occur in specific 
temporal and geographical patterns which are distinct 
from those involving adolescents and young adults.
MethODs
study design and setting
We performed a retrospective cohort study of patients 
presenting to an urban major trauma centre in London, 
UK. Our hospital receives approximately 3000 patients 
requiring trauma team activations per year, of which 25% 
are now penetrating injuries. The trauma service covers 
a population of around 3.5 million people and encom-
passes some of the most deprived regions in the country. 
All patients who met criteria for trauma team activation 
between 2004 and 2014 were screened for inclusion. We 
included patients under the age of 25 who presented to 
the emergency department after an injury involving a 
knife or other sharp implement. Accidental injuries and 
those resulting from deliberate self-harm were excluded. 
Demographic data, injury characteristics and outcomes 
were recorded prospectively by a dedicated trauma nurse 
practitioner. Incident time and location were obtained 
retrospectively from the regional ambulance service data-
base. Death preventability was determined by local peer 
review.
Definitions
To investigate age-group specific characteristics, we subdi-
vided the cohort according to the WHO definitions of 
childhood (<16 years), late adolescence (16–19 years) 
and young adulthood (20–24 years).10 Deprivation status 
was determined using the Index of Multiple Deprivation 
score based on home postcode and classified into quin-
tiles according to nationally defined cut-offs. Patients with 
missing data for home address were excluded from these 
analyses.
Data analysis
Data were analysed using Microsoft Excel V.15.3 (Micro-
soft, California, USA) and Prism V.6.0 (GraphPad, Cali-
fornia, USA). Maps were generated using Tableau V.10.1 
(Tableau software, Washington, USA). Distances between 
postcodes were calculated using open access online soft-
ware (www. 
freemaptools. 
com). Continuous data are 
reported as median with IQR and have been compared 
with Mann-Whitney U tests or Kruskal-Wallis tests with 
post-hoc corrections for multiple comparisons. Cate-
gorical data are displayed as number and percentage 
and have been compared with Fisher's exact test. A 
two-tailed p value less than 0.05 was considered signifi-
cant throughout.
Patient and public involvement
No patients were involved in the research design, and 
no patients were directly involved in the study. Since the 
conception of this study, we have established a network 
of patients and public representatives who help guide 
our ongoing violence-reduction initiatives and will be 
involved in dissemination of these findings to communi-
ties and other institutions.
results
Between 2004 and 2014, 3274 victims of assault resulting 
in penetrating trauma presented to the emergency 
department at our institution, of whom 1824 (56%) 
were aged under 25 and were included in the analysis. 
Of these, 172 (9.4%) were children, 861 (47.2%) were 
aged 16–19 and 791 (43.4%) were aged 20–24 (table 1). 
The locations of individual incidents over time is shown 
in online supplementary video 1. The annual number of 
presentations increased by an average of 25% each year. 
A substantial majority of patients (1127/1594, 71%) were 
from the most deprived quintile while only 1% (15/1594) 
were from the least deprived quintile, excluding 230 
patients who had no recorded home postcode. No major 
demographic differences were identified across the three 
age groups, but there was a trend towards higher in-hos-
pital mortality in the paediatric group (7/172, 4.1%) 
compared with the adolescent and young adult group 
(26/1652, 1.9%, p=0.08) despite comparable injury 
severity scores. Preventable or potentially preventable 
deaths at peer review were significantly more frequent in 
paediatric patients compared with older adolescents and 
young adults (5/7 deaths in the paediatric group vs 6/38 
in those aged ≥16, p=0.001).
Distinct patterns of injury were observed across the 
age range within the study cohort. The frequency of stab 
injuries rose sharply in the late teenage years, reaching 
a peak at age 18 before gradually declining (figure 1A). 
The severity of physical injury did not vary with age, and 
the majority of injuries were classified as non-critical 
(table 1). There were significant differences in the timing 
and location of injuries, with younger patients tending 
to be stabbed earlier in the day and closer to home 
(figure 1B,C).
To investigate these variations further, we compared 
patterns of injury in children (<16) with older adoles-
cents and young adults (16–24). Among children, 
a significant peak in frequency occurred between 
16:00 and 18:00 hours, accounting for 22% of all inju-
ries in this age group as compared with 11% in young 
adults (p<0.01, figure 2A). Young adults were significantly 
more likely to be stabbed after midnight (16–24 years old 
31% vs <16 years old 16%, p<0.01). We next examined 
the distance from home address to incident in these two 
age groups and found distinct distributions (figure 2B).

A large proportion of incidents occurred within 1 km of 
home in both children (35%) and young adults (41%, 
p=0.08). Children were significantly more likely to be 
stabbed between 1 and 5 km from home (48% vs 35%, 
p=0.002) but less likely to be stabbed more than 5 km 
from home (16% vs 25%, p=0.04).
We hypothesised that the specific pattern of injuries in 
children was related to school attendance. We therefore 
subdivided incidents into those occurring on school days 
and those occurring during school holidays or at week-
ends. Children were more likely to be stabbed on a school 
day than the older age group (58% vs 50%, p=0.06). In the 
paediatric group, stabbings occurred earlier on a school 
day (hours from 08:00: school day 11.1 (8.6 to 13.9) vs 
non-school day 13.7 (9.7 to 15.9], p<0.01; figure 2C) and 
a greater proportion were within 5 km of home (school 
day 90% vs non-school day 74%, p=0.02; figure 2D). 
Mapping individual incidents demonstrated that in chil-
dren the spike in frequency in the late afternoon and 
early evening was attributable to incidents occurring on 
school days (figure 3). The majority of stabbings in this 
time frame on school days occurred within 5 km of home 
which encompasses the average distance from home to 
school in children living in London.11 On non-school 
days, incidents in children were similar to those in young 
adults in terms of the timing (hours from 08:00: 13.7 
(9.7 to 15.9) vs 13.9 (10.1 to 17.5), p=0.22) and location 
relative to home (proportion >5 km from home 25.8% 
vs 26.4%, p=1.0). Stabbings on school days within 5 km 
of home accounted for 47% of the total injury burden 
among children, compared with 33% in young adults 
(p<0.001).

DIsCussIOn
In this long-term retrospective cohort study, we have 
shown that assaults resulting in penetrating injuries occur 
in distinct age-related patterns. Specifically, the period 
immediately after school accounts for a large proportion 
of incidents in children, and these predominantly occur 
close to home and school. This represents an opportunity 
for targeted preventative strategies in this population.
At both an individual and community level, knife 
crime has major physical, psychological and social conse-
quences.1 12 The incidence of interpersonal violence 
involving knives has progressively increased in the UK in 
recent years, reaching a 7-year high in 2017, and anec-
dotal reports suggest that assaults resulting in multiple 
injuries from multiple assailants are also on the rise.2 7 
However, multimodal preventative strategies can produce 
dramatic reductions in weapons offences and injuries 
among young people.13 This is exemplified by the success 
of violence-reduction initiatives in Glasgow which have 
resulted in consistent and substantial decreases in knife 
crime in a country labelled the most violent in the devel-
oped world by the United Nations in 2005.14 15 Aggres-
sive law enforcement formed the initial basis of this 
programme, including legislation to impose mandatory 
sentences for knife possession, increased duration of 
sentences and widespread use of the ‘stop and search’ 
strategy. In isolation, such strategies have had limited 
effect in other settings and may increase tensions between 
communities and law enforcement.16 17 Crucially, in the 
Glasgow example, this approach is coupled with a range 
of educational and behavioural programmes which 
raise awareness of the consequences of knife violence.13 
Addressing the broader socioeconomic factors associated 
with violence is another cornerstone of many successful 
prevention initiatives. Neighbourhood deprivation and 
concentrated poverty have consistently been shown to 
be independent risk factors for involvement in violent 
crime,18 an association which is clearly reflected in our 
cohort. There is ample evidence that community-based 
interventions to reduce environmental contributors to 
violence and minimise inequality can reduce the inci-
dence of offending, violent injury and incarceration 
among young people.19–21 It is clear that a multifaceted 
approach with sustained investment from government 
and the community is required for effective violence 
reduction.22 23
Our results provide detailed age-specific information 
regarding the timing and location of stab injuries which 
have a number of potential implications for targeted 
violence-reduction strategies. The sharp increase in 
stab injuries between the ages of 14 and 16 suggests that 
educational programmes and other preventative inter-
ventions are best delivered in primary or early secondary 
education. Given the peak in incidents at the end of 
the school day, an attractive option is staggered release 
times from school which could be coupled with a visible 
deterrent by law enforcement at transport hubs, eateries 
and other areas of pupil congregation after school. 
Combating weapons carriage through a ‘stop and search’ 
strategy, which remains a hotly debated issue, will be 
better informed by accurate incident data such as that 
presented here. However, these direct approaches will 
only produce a sustained reduction in knife crime when 
delivered in the context of a co-ordinated plan to combat 
violent behaviour and its root causes.
From a clinical perspective, the majority of stab inju-
ries in our cohort resulted in relatively minor physical 
injuries, and deaths were infrequent. However, over 
half of all stabbings resulted in multiple injuries. This 
is more than double the frequency observed in a study 
conducted in our catchment area 30 years ago24 which 
supports anecdotal observations of increasing intensity of 
violence involving knives. We found that children had a 
higher overall mortality and a higher frequency of poten-
tially preventable deaths compared with young adults 
despite comparable injury severity scores. Further study 
is required to determine the reasons for this observation 
and whether a similar trend is evident in other trauma 
systems and in other injury patterns. Although the imple-
mentation of regional trauma networks in England 
and Wales has produced substantial improvements in 
outcomes from major injury in adults, similar evidence 
in children is currently lacking and is the subject of an 
ongoing multicentre investigation.25
The limitations to our study include its observational 
design, most notably in that the apparent relationship 
between paediatric stab injuries and school attendance 
represents an association only. The generalisability of our 
findings to other geographical areas and other forms of 
interpersonal violence may be limited. Because we only 
included patients meeting criteria for trauma team acti-
vation, our study may have missed those attending with 
more minor injuries. Owing to the healthcare-based 
setting of this study, we were not able to consider the 
demographics of the assailants and the victims in this 
analysis. In addition, our registry did not allow detailed 
analysis of behavioural patterns, violent recidivism and 
gang involvement in individual patients. These gaps 
in the present study are currently being investigated 
prospectively within our trauma system. Finally, because 
of changes in our regional trauma system during the 
study period, we were not able to comment on trends in 
incidence over time.
Our study illustrates and reiterates the potent influence 
of deprivation, age and gender on the risk of violent injury. 
We have demonstrated that there are age-specific epide-
miological patterns of stabbings among young people 
and identify specific targets for focused violence-reduc-
tion strategies in children. Long-term, multiagency inter-
ventions are essential to drive sustained reductions in 
interpersonal violence and will be better informed by 
the recognition of knife crime as a pressing public health 
issue.
