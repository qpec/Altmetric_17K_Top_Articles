BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Prematurity, a strong risk factor for sudden unexpected infant 
death (SUID), was addressed in recommendations by the American Academy of Pediatrics 
in 2011 for safe sleep education in NICUs. We documented associations between gestational 
age (GA) and SUID subsequent to these guidelines.
METHODS: Using the 2012–2013 US linked infant birth and death certificate period files, 
we documented rates per live births of sudden infant death syndrome, ill-defined and 
unspecified causes, accidental suffocation and strangulation in bed, and overall SUID by GA 
in postneonatal, out-of-hospital, and autopsied cases; compared survivors and cases; and 
estimated logistic regression models of associations between GA and SUID.
RESULTS: SUID cases were more likely than survivors to be <37 weeks’ GA (22.61% vs 10.79%; 
P < .0001). SUID rates were 2.68, 1.94, 1.46, 1.16, 0.73, and 0.51 per 1000 live births for 24 
to 27, 28 to 31, 32 to 33, 34 to 36, 37 to 38, and 39 to 42 weeks’ GA, respectively. Logistic 
regression models additionally indicated declines in the risk for SUID as GA increased. 
Prenatal smoking, inadequate prenatal care, and demographics associated with poverty 
were strongly associated with SUID.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite the 2011 American Academy of Pediatrics recommendations for 
increased safe sleep education in the NICUs, SUID rates were inversely associated with 
GA in 2012 to 2013, suggesting that risk of SUID associated with prematurity has multiple 
etiologies requiring continued investigation, including biological vulnerabilities and 
the efficacy of NICU education programs, and that strategies to reduce SUID should be 
multifaceted.

The rate of sudden infant death 
syndrome (SIDS) in the United States 
declined from 1.20 per 1000 live 
births in 1992, the year the American 
Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) first 
issued its recommendation for supine 
sleep, to 0.51 in 2010, the year 
preceding its 2011 recommendations 
addressing SIDS and other sleep-
related infant deaths.1, 
 
2 Declines 
occurred across all gestational age 
(GA) groups, with 44.8%, 25.8%, 
20.0%, 19.6%, and 30.8% reductions 
in rates for infants with GAs of 28 
to 31, 32 to 33, 34 to 36, 37 to 38, 
and 39 to 40 weeks, respectively, 
between 1999 and 2010.2, 
 
3 However, 
SIDS remained inversely associated 
with GA; for example, the rate in 
2010 was 1.39 per 1000 for infants 
born at 28 to 31 weeks compared 
with 0.36 for term infants. The 
elevated risk associated with younger 
GA has been attributed to physiologic, 
social, and environmental factors.4, 
 
5  
For example, some studies have 
found that preterm infants are more 
likely to be placed prone and to bed-
share, which are major risk factors 
for SIDS, 
6, 
 
7 and that the combination 
of prematurity and environmental 
conditions multiplies the risk.8
Along with SIDS, other sleep-related 
infant deaths categorized as ill-
defined and unspecified causes of 
mortality (IUCM) and accidental 
suffocation and strangulation in bed 
(ASSB) comprise a broad category 
termed sudden unexpected infant 
deaths (SUID).4, 
 
9 Variations in the 
application of these diagnoses have 
generated a diagnostic shift, which 
is reflected in a decline in SIDS 
alongside an increase in other sleep-
related deaths, making it important 
to consider the full grouping of SUID.9 
Similarities in risk factors across 
causes have also led to the inclusion 
of the broader grouping in research 
studies.4, 
10 SUID is now among the 
health indicators tracked for Healthy 
People 2020.9, 
 
10
We sought to determine the 
association between GA and SUID in 
US births subsequent to the 2011 Safe 
Infant Sleep Guidelines of the AAP, 
which provided recommendations to 
help NICUs educate parents, model 
safe sleep guidelines, and develop 
supportive policies.4
MeThODs
Linked US infant birth and death 
certificate period files for 2012 and 
2013 were downloaded from the 
National Center for Health Statistics 
Web site.11 Data for the 7 907 113 
births from this period were pooled. 
The sample was limited to births with 
GAs of 24 to 42 completed weeks  
and birth weights of 400 to 6000 g,  
reducing the births for analysis to 
7 654 494. Exclusion of births to 
mothers in an “other” race category 
additionally reduced the sample to 
7 081 763. Of the 29 299 recorded 
deaths in this sample, 46.4% were 
postneonatal (>27 days of age); 29.8% 
were outside of a hospital; and 43.2% 
received autopsies. Of the 6447 deaths 
that met all conditions (postneonatal, 
outside of a hospital, and autopsied), 
1789 were attributed to causes 
other than SUID and excluded, 
additionally reducing available cases 
to 7 057 122 births consisting of 
7 052 464 survivors and 4658 SUID-
attributed deaths. Figure 1 presents 
an inclusion/exclusion flowchart.
SUIDs were defined based on 
International Classification of 
Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) 
codes as R95 (SIDS), R99 (IUCM), 
and W75 (ASSB) in keeping with the 
criteria for Healthy People 2020. GA 
was categorized as 24 to 27, 28 to 31,

32 to 33, 34 to 36, 37 to 38, and 39 to 
42 weeks.2
The analysis included maternal 
demographic, obstetric, and 
behavioral characteristics commonly 
associated with SIDS and other sleep-
related infant deaths. Demographic 
characteristics included race/
ethnicity, marital status, age, and 
education. Obstetric characteristics 
included gravida, delivery mode, 
sex, and multiple birth. Behavioral 
characteristics included prenatal 
cigarette smoking and prenatal care 
use measured by the Adequacy of 
Prenatal Care Utilization (APNCU) 
Index, addressing both the timing 
of care initiation and the number 
of visits compared with what is 
recommended for an infant’s GA, 
according to the American College of 
Obstetrics and Gynecology.12
Records with complete information 
on all analysis variables were used 
in the main analyses, resulting in an 
analytic sample of 5 681 596 births 
(Fig 1). However, in supplementary 
analyses, we used multiple 
imputation on a random sample of 
20% of the 7 057 122 cases, which 
allowed us to include cases with 
missing data on analysis variables 
other than the outcome and to assess 
the sensitivity of our estimates.
First, we documented rates per 
live births of SIDS, IUCM, ASSB, 
and overall SUID deaths by GA, 
along with statistical comparisons 
of death rates between each GA 
category and full-term births within 
SUID and each of its subtypes. Next, 
we compared characteristics of 
survivors, SUID cases, and SUID 
subcategories by using χ2 tests for 
statistical significance. Then, we 
estimated logistic regression models 
of associations between SUID and GA. 
The first model was unadjusted. The 
second controlled for demographic 
and obstetric characteristics. 
The third added behavioral 
characteristics. Stata version 13.0 
statistical software (Stata Corp, 
College Station, TX) was used to 
conduct all analyses. This study met 
institutional review board standards 
for exempt review.
ResulTs
Of the 7 057 122 births meeting 
the basic inclusion criteria, 4658 
had an out-of-hospital, autopsied, 
postneonatal death attributed to 
SUID. Of these, 2337 (50%) were 
coded as SIDS, 1268 (27%) as IUCM, 
and 1053 (23%) as ASSB. The overall 
rate of death from SUID was 0.66 per 
1000 live births; the rates for SIDS, 
IUCM, and ASSB were 0.33, 0.18, and 
0.15, respectively (Table 1). For each 
cause-of-death category and for the 
combined category of SUID, the rate 
of death was inversely associated 
with GA. Within each cause-of-death 
category, the death rate for each GA 
category was significantly higher 
than that for term births (P < .001).
The mean postnatal age of death in 
days was 110.2 for SIDS, 113.0 for 
IUCM, 112.1 for ASSB, and 111.4 for 
SUID. Rounded to whole weeks, the 
corresponding means were 15.7, 
16.1, 16.0, and 15.9, respectively. 
The mean postconceptional age of 
death, which could be calculated 
only in whole weeks because GA was 
available only in weeks, was 53.3 for 
SIDS, 53.6 for IUCM, 53.8 for ASSB, 
and 53.6 weeks for the overall SUID 
category. Postnatal age of death for 
SUID and its categories decreased and 
postconceptional age increased with 
increasing GA (Supplemental Table 4).
 
Table 2 compares GA and other 
characteristics of surviving infants 
with those of SUID cases. In addition 
to having a higher overall percentage  
of preterm births compared with  
survivors (22.6% vs 10.8%), with  
a nearly fourfold greater difference  
in the 24- to 27-week GA group, the  
SUID group had twice the percentage  
of non-Hispanic African American  
mothers, 1.7 times the percentage  
of unmarried mothers, 1.9 times the  
percentage of mothers <18 years  
old, 1.7 times the percentage of  
mothers who had a less than high  
school–level education, 1.3 times  
the percentage of mothers with  
gravida >3, 1.2 times the percentage 
of boys, 3.9 times the percentage of 
infants with a birth weight <1000 g, 
3.6 times the percentage of mothers 
who smoked during pregnancy, and 
1.7 times the percentage of mothers 
with inadequate prenatal care (all  
P < .001).
Results from the logistic regression 
models additionally indicate a decline 
in the risk for SUID as GA increased 
(Table 3). In unadjusted and adjusted 
models, the shortest GA group (24 
to 27 weeks) had the highest odds of 
experiencing SUID (unadjusted odds 
ratio [OR] = 5.03, 95% confidence 
interval [CI] = 3.84–6.57; adjusted 
OR [aOR] = 3.53, 95% CI = 2.69–4.63, 
model 2). When behavioral factors 
were added (model 3), the aOR for 
GA did not change, although there 
was a strong association between 
prenatal smoking and SUID (aOR =  
2.89, 95% CI = 2.67–3.13) and 
between both inadequate and 
intermediate care and SUID (aOR =  
1.38, 95% CI = 1.26–1.52 and 
aOR = 1.31, 95% CI = 1.18–1.46, 
respectively) (Supplemental Table

5). Maternal race/ethnicity was 
independently associated with SUID 
in a pattern widely documented 
for many birth outcomes.13 Marital 
status, age, and education also had 
strong associations with SUID in the 
expected directions, as did gravida. 
Finally, obstetric characteristics 
(infant sex, multiple birth, and 
vaginal birth) had independent 
significant associations in the 
expected directions with SUID.
Estimates using multiple imputation 
on a random sample of 20% 
were similar to those in Table 3 
(Supplemental Table 6), suggesting 
that missing data did not bias the 
estimates. The estimates were also 
insensitive to an alternative index 
of prenatal care (Revised Graduated 
Index)12 and to indicators for which 
trimester prenatal care was initiated 
instead of an index of prenatal care 
adequacy (data not shown).
DIscussIOn
We found that postneonatal 
deaths attributed to SUID and 
its components were inversely 
associated with GA in 2012 to 2013.4 
For SUID, SIDS, IUCM, and ASSB, the 
mortality rates per 1000 live births 
for postneonatal out-of-hospital 
deaths were 81%, 75%, 88%, and 
80% lower, respectively, for term 
infants compared with infants with 
GA in the 24- to 27-week range. 
In studies on earlier cohorts, the 
corresponding figures for SIDS were 
similar at 70% and 73%.10, 
 
14  
In logistic regression models, the 
adjusted odds of SUID were highest 
for infants with GAs of 24 to 27 
weeks, remained so even when 
risk factors, including smoking 
and inadequate prenatal care, 
were controlled for, and uniformly 
decreased as GA increased, with even 
the 37- to 38-week group having 
significantly higher odds of SUID 
compared with term infants. Our 
findings are also consistent with 
previous studies that age of death 
declined as GA increased.10
Both biological factors and unsafe 
sleep practices have been suggested as 
increasing the odds of SUID at lower 
GAs.4, 
 
15, 
 
16 We were unable to explore 
the role of sleep practices because 
US death records do not include that

information and the Pregnancy Risk 
Assessment Monitoring System, a 
surveillance program of the Centers 
for Disease Control and Prevention 
(CDC) with information on infant safe 
sleep practices, is not yet available for 
2012 to 2013. Of note, even before the 
2011 AAP guidelines, not all studies 
found that infants with shorter GA 
were exposed to more adverse sleep 
practices. In the National Infant Sleep 
Position Study, there was no significant 
association between preterm birth 
(<37 weeks) and supine sleep in 2003 
to 2007.17 Another study using 2000–
2011 Pregnancy Risk Assessment 
Monitoring System data found no less 
use of the supine position for infants 
born at <34 weeks’ GA compared with 
term infants.18 However, this study 
did find a small positive association 
when comparing late-preterm to term 
infants, consistent with findings from 
an earlier study.6 Bed-sharing, another 
risk factor for SUID, was reported 
to be a usual practice by 11.2% of 
families in the National Infant Sleep 
Position Study and was associated with 
prematurity.7 However, in a study of 
hazardous bedding, such as pillows, 
blankets, and quilts, prematurity was 
not a significant predictor.19
Although there is little suggestive 
evidence that the observed 
associations between GA and SUID in 
2012 to 2013 were directly related 
to sleep practices, the pattern could 
reflect larger effects of adverse 
sleep practices at younger GAs due 
to heightened vulnerability of less-
developed infants. For example, 
there is evidence of reduced cerebral 
oxygenation in the prone position 
in infants with younger GAs.8, 
 
20 It is 
also possible that preterm infants 
experience a greater number of 
concurrent risk factors, which may 
have a multiplicative effect. A study 
of SIDS cases found that 78% had 2 to 
7 concurrent risks.21 In the preterm 
SIDS cases, 70% were nonsupine at 
last sleep, over half had mothers and 
fathers who were smokers, and 43% 
shared a sleep surface. Future studies 
should investigate sleep practices 
and exposure to multiple concurrent 
risk factors as potential explanations 
of associations between GA and SUID.
Regardless of whether sleep practices 
play a role in explaining the observed 
association between GA and SUID in 
2012 to 2013, our findings indicate 
that enhanced recommendations for 
safe sleep education in the NICU were 
not sufficient to reduce or eliminate the 
inverse association between GA and 
SUID or its component causes  
of death. However, we should not  
infer from our findings that safe  
sleep guidelines are an ineffective  
strategy for decreasing the risk of  
SUID, either overall or as it relates to 
prematurity. First, rates of SIDS have 
declined since the guidelines were 
established, even at young GAs.1, 
 
10  
Second, as noted earlier, data on 
sleep practices by GA are unavailable 
for the cohort we studied. Third, 
guidelines can have impact only if 
they produce behavioral change. 
Little is known about adherence to 
safe sleep guidelines after NICU stays 
and how that might vary by GA, and 
there is room for improvement in 
the level of provider knowledge in 
the NICU, education for parents, and 
methods used to assess the efficacy 
of educational interventions.22 
– 
30 
For example, studies assessing 
at-home compliance should probably 
use methodologies other than self-
report, as demonstrated by a recent 
study incorporating nocturnal video 
assessment.23 Fourth, adherence 
to safe sleep guidelines requires 
resources (eg, access to cribs that meet 
safety standards and secure home 
environments in which to use them). 
Consistent with past research, 
31 we 
found that mothers of SUID cases were 
less educated, younger, more likely 
to be unmarried, and more likely to 
be non-Hispanic African American 
than those of surviving infants. These 
characteristics are associated with a 
greater likelihood of poverty, which is 
strongly associated with overall infant 
mortality, 
32 preterm birth, 
33 and lower 
compliance with safe sleep practices.7 
Thus, our findings underscore the 
importance of identifying population-
specific challenges to the adoption of 
safe infant sleep practices.
Of note, we found that prenatal 
cigarette smoking was a strong 
risk factor for SUID, controlling for 
demographic and obstetric risk 
factors as well as GA. It has been well 
established that fetal exposure to 
tobacco smoke increases the risk of 
preterm birth34 and SIDS.35, 
 
36  
Prenatal smoking has been 
associated with deficient hypoxia 
awakening responses37 and 
attenuated recovery from hypoxemic 
challenges, 
38 a possible explanation 
for their greater vulnerability and 
for a potentially higher burden from 
other risk factors, such as hazardous 
bedding. Multiple mechanisms can 
increase the risk of SIDS when the 
fetus is exposed to tobacco smoke. 
These include the occurrence of 
abnormalities in regions of the

42 Education 
on safe infant sleep environments 
should address the risks of smoke 
exposure and ideally be implemented 
before conception. Although smoking 
throughout pregnancy increases the 
risk of preterm birth, quitting early 
reduces the risk for all but extremely 
preterm births.34
The strengths of our study include 
the focus on the broad category of 
SUID, which has become the standard 
measure of unexplained infant deaths 
in research studies and a health 
indicator tracked for Healthy People 
2020. Another strength is the use 
of the linked infant birth and death 
certificate period files for 2012 to 
2013, which captured nearly every 
birth and infant death in the United 
States, thus providing contemporary 
national estimates of associations 
between GA and SUID. These data 
also allowed us to incorporate 
important demographic, obstetric, 
and behavioral variables.
A limitation of our study is that the 
linked infant birth and death files may 
contain inaccuracies in the diagnosis 
of SUID-associated deaths because 
information was lacking on whether 
these largely unwitnessed deaths had 
received a death-scene investigation, 
which is a key component of defining 
SIDS.43 
– 
45 Corrective steps were 
taken by the CDC with the creation 
of a reporting form (www. 
cdc. 
gov/ 
sids/ 
pdf/ 
suidi- 
form2- 
1- 
2010. 
pdf) 
and the development of the SUID 
Case Registry (www. 
cdc. 
gov/ 
sids/ 
caseregistry), which enables the 
CDC to evaluate the use of death 
scene investigations in enrolled 
states.45 Although 98% of cases in 
7 enrolled states had conducted a 
death scene investigation, 
45 as of 
2015, only a minority of states and 
regions were enrolled in cooperative 
agreements with the Registry. Thus, 
the degree to which other states 
have comparably high rates of death 
scene investigation is unknown. 
However, because, for most cases, the 
diagnostic variability falls within the 
3 SUID components, the use of the 
combined category of SUID should 
attenuate this limitation.9
A second limitation is that in 2012 
to 2013, not all states reported the 
obstetric estimate (OE) of GA, which 
was phased in as states adopted 
the 2003 birth certificate revision. 
The OE, which is determined 
according to National Center for 
Health Statistics46 birth reporting 
guidelines, is considered more 
accurate than the last menstrual 
period (LMP)-based measure.47 
According to a recent report, 41 
states and Washington, DC reported 
OEs for 2013 in addition to LMP-
based GAs, which all states have 
reported since 1981; those 41 states 
plus Washington, DC accounted for 
90% of births in the United States 
in 2013, and weeks of GA were 
identical using the OE- and LMP-
based measures for 62.1% of those 
births, within 1 week for 83.4%, and 
within 2 weeks for 91.4%.48 Given 
that most states used the OE in 2012 
to 2013, the high rates of agreement 
between the OE- and LMP-based 
estimates within 1 and 2 weeks, and 
the use of GA categories instead of 
individual weeks, mismeasurement 
of GA is unlikely a significant 
limitation.
Another limitation is that we were 
unable to directly explore the roles 
of sleep practices and other potential 
mechanisms underlying the observed 
association between GA and SUID. 
We did find that prenatal smoking, 
although strongly associated with 
SUID, did not explain any of the 
association between SUID and GA, 
and we questioned whether these 
findings were due to underreporting 
of this behavior. However, although 
smoking is underreported in birth 
records in the United States, the 
extent of underreporting of smoking 
is much lower than for most other 
data elements and is similar for 
term and preterm births.49 Thus, the 
underreporting of smoking may have 
resulted in a conservative estimated 
association between smoking and 
SUID.
cOnclusIOns
Despite the 2011 AAP guidelines 
addressing GA differences in SIDS 
and other sleep-related infant 
deaths through enhanced NICU safe 
infant sleep education, data from 
the US linked infant birth and death 
certificate period files for 2012 to 
2013 demonstrate that an inverse 
relationship between GA and SUID 
remains. The risk for SUID associated 
with prematurity likely has multiple 
etiologies requiring continued 
investigation, including increased 
biological vulnerabilities to risk 
factors at earlier GAs and the efficacy 
of NICU education programs. Prenatal 
smoking, inadequate prenatal care 
use, and poverty-related factors 
were also strongly associated with 
SUID, suggesting that intervention 
strategies to reduce SUID should be 
multifaceted and broad-based.
