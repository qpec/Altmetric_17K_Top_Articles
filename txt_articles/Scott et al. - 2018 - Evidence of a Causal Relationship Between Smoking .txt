There has been emerging evidence of an association between tobacco smoking and
schizophrenia spectrum disorders (SSD). Two meta-analyses have reported that people
who smoke tobacco have an ∼2-fold increased risk of incident schizophrenia or
psychosis, even after adjusting for confounding factors. This study aimed to critically
appraise the research which has examined the association between tobacco smoking
and SSD against the Bradford Hill criteria for causality, to determine the strength of
the evidence for a causal relationship. Eight longitudinal studies (seven cohort studies
and one case control study) were identified which examined tobacco smoking as an
exposure and psychosis as an outcome. All seven cohort studies were assessed as
being of high quality using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Six of the eight studies found a
statistically significant positive association between tobacco smoking and onset of SSD.
These studies reported a consistent association with a moderate to large effect size and
a dose response relationship. The studies adjusted for multiple potential confounders
including age, sex, socioeconomic status, shared genetic risk, prodromal symptoms, and
comorbid cannabis and other substance use. The studies did not adjust for exposure
to childhood trauma or prenatal tobacco. There was substantial though inconclusive
evidence supporting a causal relationship between tobacco smoking and increased
risk of SSD. If a causal relationship does exist, nicotine is most likely responsible for
this association. This raises serious public health concerns about the increasing use of
e-cigarettes and other products, particularly by adolescents whose nicotine use may
increase their risk of SSD. Research is urgently needed to examine the association
between e-cigarette use and incident psychosis, particularly in adolescents and young
adults.

Does Smoking Tobacco Cause Schizophrenia?
INTRODUCTION
Schizophrenia
spectrum
disorders
(SSD)
are
heterogeneous syndromes with well-established risk factors
including exposure to childhood adversity, cannabis use during
adolescence, a history of obstetric complications, stressful events
during adulthood, and low maternal serum folate level (1).
In recent years, there has been a growing interest in tobacco
smoking as a risk factor for SSD (2, 3).
Tobacco smoking is known to cause a wide range of physical
health problems. It is the leading cause of preventable death,
through increasing the risk of lung and other malignancies,
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), coronary heart
disease, cerebrovascular disease, asthma and diabetes (4).
Two systematic reviews and meta-analyses have examined the
association between tobacco smoking and psychotic disorders
(2, 3). In pooling longitudinal studies (n = 5), Gurillo and
colleagues reported a 2-fold increase in the risk of incident
psychotic disorders in people who were daily tobacco smokers
compared to those who were not (RR = 2.18; 95% CI 1.23–
3.85). Similarly, Hunter et al. (3) who pooled data from studies
identified using inclusion criteria with the outcome restricted
to schizophrenia (N = 5) also reported smoking tobacco was
associated with a 2-fold risk of schizophrenia (RR = 1.99; 95%
CI 1.10–3.61). Both studies concluded that further research was
needed to examine the potential causal role of tobacco smoking
in the onset of SSD.
The association between tobacco smoking and SSD is of
growing significance. There is evidence that nicotine alters
signaling in the dopaminergic, cholinergic, and glutamatergic
neurotransmitter systems, particularly in adolescence (5). Whilst
the smoking of tobacco by young people has declined in many
high income countries, there has been an increase in exposure
to nicotine by this demographic through the availability of e-
cigarettes (6). It is therefore important to critically examine the
evidence for a causal relationship between tobacco smoking and
SSD.
In this review we aimed to evaluate the relationship between
tobacco smoking and SSD which we defined as any non-affective
psychotic disorder against causal criteria based on the Bradford
Hill Framework (7, 8). The Bradford Hill Framework provides
nine criteria for establishing a causal relationship between
an exposure and outcome. This review examined longitudinal
studies identified from the two recent systematic reviews of
tobacco smoking and incident SSD and other identified studies.
The evidence for a causal relationship between tobacco smoking
and SSD, alternative explanations for the association and the
health implications are discussed.
METHODS
Literature Search
We used the results of the two recently conducted systematic
reviews (2, 3) to identify studies which examined tobacco
smoking as an exposure and SSD as an outcome. As the
review by Hunter et al. (3) restricted the outcome to
a diagnosis of schizophrenia, we used the broader search
strategy of Gurillo et al. (2) to identify studies from January
2014 to May 2018 that included the broader outcome of
psychosis. These psychosis outcomes included schizophrenia,
schizophreniform disorder, schizoaffective disorder, delusional
disorder, non-affective psychotic disorder, atypical psychosis,
psychotic depression, and bipolar mania with psychotic features.
The inclusion criteria of the current review were: (a)
longitudinal case control or cohort studies; (b) study populations
of participants with psychosis or schizophrenia as the outcome
(defined as those who meet the diagnostic criteria by structured
interview or diagnosed by treating clinician); (c) presence of
tobacco smoking prior to psychosis or schizophrenia diagnosis.
Studies which were cross sectional in design or only provided
sub-diagnostic outcomes of psychosis (e.g., psychotic symptoms,
hallucinations, delusions) were excluded.
Data Extraction
Titles and abstracts of the articles were reviewed to identify
studies
that
met
the
eligibility
criteria.
The
following
characteristics were extracted from each study when available:
(a) study methodology (including author, publication year,
location, study design, follow-up period, sample numbers, loss
to follow-up, age at baseline, tobacco smoking measures, and
assessment of psychosis or schizophrenia), and (b) study findings
(effect size metrics, 95% CI, and confounders adjusted for).
The quality or the studies assessing for risk of bias was
evaluated using Newcastle–Ottawa Scale (NOS) (9) as shown in
Supplementary Table 1. The NOS is a method recommended
by the Cochrane Non-randomized Studies Methods Working
Group to evaluate the quality of the study. Points are assigned
based on the selection process of cohorts (0–4 points), the
comparability of the cohorts (0–2 points) and the identification
of the exposures and the outcomes of research participants (0–
3 points). A score of 7 or greater out of 9 was defined as high
quality. Studies were assessed independently by two reviewers
(LM and JS).
Assessment of Causality
Studies that met inclusion and exclusion criteria were assessed
using causal criteria based on the Bradford Hill Framework
shown in Supplementary Table 2. Of the nine criteria, five
were chosen as most relevant for the purposes of this study
(strength of association, consistency, temporality, dose-response,
and biological plausibility). Given that smoking is known to
cause a wide range of health problems, the criteria of specificity
was not applicable. No studies have performed experimental
manipulation exposing adolescents to tobacco because of the
known harmful effects therefore this criteria was not included.
Coherence was not included because of the lack of homogenous
pathology evident in psychosis. In relation to analogy, the
association between cannabis use and psychosis, reported to
be causal (1) has some analogy to that of tobacco and
psychosis. However, it is widely recognized that adolescents
who smoke tobacco are more likely to smoke cannabis (10–
12). Thus, cannabis rather than being analogous to tobacco in
its relationship with psychosis may in fact be an important
confounder. Similarly there are other important environmental

factors which might confound the relationship between tobacco
smoking and incident psychotic disorder. To address this
concern, for the purpose of assessing evidence of causality, we
included an extra criteria “accounted for confounding.” These six
criteria were deemed appropriate by the research team in order
to grade the associations reported between adolescent tobacco
smoking and future risk of SSD as a basis for causality discussion
(7).
RESULTS
Gurillo and colleagues (2) identified four studies which met
the specified inclusion criteria (13–16). One of the longitudinal
studies (17) which they included in their pooled analysis did
not determine the presence of tobacco smoking before the
schizophrenia diagnosis and was therefore excluded. Hunter et al.
(3) included another study (18) and the updated search identified
a further three studies which met inclusion criteria (13, 19–21).
In total, eight studies (seven cohort and one case-control studies)
were included for assessment of a causal relationship between
tobacco smoking in adolescence and incident SSD. Using the
NOS, all seven cohort studies scored 7/9 or greater demonstrating
they were of high quality (Table 1).
Study Characteristics
Table 2 summarizes the study characteristics. They utilized birth
cohort studies of offspring (19, 21) or mothers (15), cohorts
of young male conscripts from defense forces (14, 16), two
cohorts combined, the first consisting of mothers recruited from
a birth cohort, the second were male conscripts Kendler et al.
(13) and two general population cohorts to assess cardiovascular
risk factors (18). The longitudinal case control study was of
participants at clinical high risk of psychosis (20). All studies were
from high income countries. The follow-up period of all cohort
studies was adequate to ascertain incident cases of SSD, ranging
from a minimum of 4 years (14) to a maximum of 48 years (15).
Two of the studies were genetically informed with one examining
psychosis risk in family members discordant for smoking (13),
the other examining schizophrenia in people with different alleles
of the rs1051730 genotype in the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor
gene stratified by smoking status (18).
Assessment of Studies Against Bradford
Hill Criteria
Using causal criteria, based on the Bradford Hill Framework
Hill (8), of the eight studies examined, six reported a positive
association between tobacco smoking and risk of schizophrenia
spectrum disorder. The strength of the associations were robust
ranging from an almost 50% increased risk (15) to a 6-fold
increased risk of schizophrenia in heavy smokers (18). In these
six studies, all reported a temporal association with appropriate
adjustment for confounding variables, particularly comorbid
substance use. All but one (19) demonstrated a dose response
relationship between tobacco use and SSD. By contrast, one
study (16) reported that smoking tobacco reduced the risk
of schizophrenia and the case control study (20) found no
association.
DISCUSSION
Two meta-analyses have demonstrated that smoking tobacco is
associated with a 2-fold increase in risk of incident schizophrenia
(3) or broader psychosis (2). Based on these systematic reviews
and our own literature search, we identified eight studies
that examined the longitudinal association between tobacco
smoking and incident SSD of which six demonstrated a positive
association (13–15, 18, 19, 21), one a negative association
(16) and the final study showed no association (20). Using
the Bradford Hill framework, a causal association between
tobacco smoking and onset of SSD is discussed on the basis of
strength of association, temporality, dose-response, adjustment

the association however it was still
significant suggesting the relationship
between smoking cigarettes and

for confounding factors, biological plausibility, and consistency
of the association.
Strength
Of the six studies that found a positive association (13–15, 18,
19, 21), five reported moderate to large effect sizes (22) (Tables 2,
3) consistent with a causal relationship (8). Sørensen et al.
(15) reported a smaller effect size with a 42% increase in the
odds of schizophrenia spectrum disorder in people who smoked
cigarettes.
Consistency
Consistency of the association is assessed through multiple
studies of independent cohorts confirming the same result. In
the eight longitudinal studies, six reported a positive association
between tobacco smoking and incident SSD. Of the two which
did not report a positive association, one was a case-control study
of participants at clinical high risk for psychosis which found
that neither tobacco nor cannabis smoking were associated with
transition to psychosis. The prevalence of tobacco and cannabis
dependence in this cohort was low and the study may have
been underpowered to examine the effects of these substances
on transition to psychosis. Zammit et al. (16) reported that
smoking tobacco was associated with a lower risk of future
schizophrenia, and was therefore inconsistent with the main
body of research. The overwhelming majority of studies showed
a positive relationship fulfilling criteria for consistency.
Temporality
The six studies that reported a positive association demonstrated
a clear temporal relationship with the exposure of tobacco
smoking preceding the onset of SSD. Schizophrenia spectrum
disorders frequently have an insidious onset with a long
prodrome. In order to address this concern, (21), adjusted for
prodromal psychotic symptoms at baseline and Kendler et al. (13)
accounted for the possible prodrome by conducting a subanalysis
restricting the onset of SSD to at least 5 years following
initial exposure to tobacco. The relationship between tobacco
smoking and onset of schizophrenia was largely attenuated
after accounting for the prodrome rendering reverse causality
an unlikely explanation for the association between tobacco
use and SSD thus suggesting tobacco smoking precedes the
illness.
Dose-Response
A dose response between tobacco smoking and incident SSD
was reported in five of the six studies reporting a positive
association. In three studies (14, 15, 21) a significant linear trend
was demonstrated where the risk of SSD increased with the
an increase in tobacco smoking. In two studies (13, 18), those
who smoked more daily tobacco had an increase in the odds of
developing SSD.
Potential Confounders
The relationship between tobacco use and SSD remained
significant even after adjusting for factors that might confound

the
relationship
including
family
socio-economic
status,
cannabis use (1), parental substance abuse and parental
psychosis (23–27). A shared genetic liability was also accounted
for in two genetically informed studies (13, 18). Adjustment
for confounders attenuated the strength of the association but
significance was maintained in all but one study (19), probably
due to a lack of power for the analysis. None of the studies
adjusted for childhood trauma (28).
Biological Plausibility
Tobacco and tobacco smoke contain almost 5,000 different
chemicals. Nicotine is the most important pharmacologically
active and psychotogenic compound in tobacco smoke because
of its interaction with nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (29).
Previous reports on tobacco smoking suggests that nicotine
could
alter
signaling
of
dopaminergic,
cholinergic,
and
glutamatergic neurotransmitter systems (5, 30) and thus
could potentially influence brain development as suggested by
studies of adolescent nicotine exposure and neurodevelopmental
trajectories (5). Also, excess nicotine intake during early
adolescence is associated with abnormal white matter maturation
in adults (31), and chronic cigarette smoking has been linked
to structural brain changes such as gray matter decreases in the
prefrontal cortex, which correspond with areas where functional
alterations occur from nicotine exposure (32).
Furthermore,
recent
evidence
suggest
that
adolescent
nicotine use could have persistent effects on nicotine receptor
responsiveness, which results in the strengthening of negative
emotional changes and alterations in cognitive functioning (5).
Alternative Explanations
There are other explanations for the positive association
between tobacco smoking and SSD. Individuals who develop
schizophrenia are more likely to have externalizing symptoms
in childhood and adolescence (33, 34) and children with
externalizing symptoms are more likely to smoke tobacco during
adolescence (35). There may be unmeasured confounding. None
of the studies adjusted for childhood trauma, a well-established
risk factor for SSD (1, 28) and for tobacco use (36). Similarly
there was no adjustment for prenatal tobacco smoking exposure
which is associated with both an increased risk of smoking
in adolescence (37) and an increased risk of schizophrenia
even after adjusting for life time smoking (3, 38). Furthermore,
recent studies have suggested bidirectional associations by
revealing single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with
nicotine dependence (CHRNA5) that are also associated with
schizophrenia (39, 40).
LIMITATIONS
Each
study
included
in
this
review
is
observational
in
methodology, and the majority of cohort studies included had
significant attrition. Participants who are most likely to be lost to
follow up are more likely to be socioeconomically disadvantaged
and be at increased risk of both tobacco smoking and mental
illness. Therefore, it is unlikely that attrition would significantly
affect reported associations. Measurement of tobacco smoking
has been measured via self-report or by interview, generally
at one point in time and often retrospectively recalled. Only
one study measured the long-term smoking exposure prior
the psychotic illness using pack-years (18) which provides a
more precise measurement of tobacco smoke exposure. Further,
no studies have used biological markers for tobacco smoking
such as expired air carbon monoxide (41) or serum cotinine
measurement (42). These limitations are inherent to large cohort
and registry studies and are difficult to overcome. Finally, as two
recent systematic reviews had been published on this topic, we
relied on these to identify the studies included in this review
rather than replicating the searches in these studies.
Implications
Given tobacco is known to have widespread adverse health
outcomes and governments around the world are adopting
policies to reduce tobacco smoking, why is it important to clarify
if smoking tobacco has a causal role in the onset of SSD? The first
reason is that better understanding the aetiopathogenesis of SSD
will inform our knowledge of this syndrome which may lead to
better treatments. The second, a much more urgent consideration
is the growing availability of electronic (e) cigarettes. These have
been developed as a safer alternative to cigarettes by enabling
nicotine use without the exposure to carcinogenic chemicals
associated with smoking tobacco.
However, there is growing use of e-cigarettes and other
nicotine products by adolescents (6) and it is acknowledged
that the health effects of e-cigarettes on youth are not fully
understood (43). In addition to tobacco and cannabis, there is
now evidence that adolescents who use inhalants are at increased
risk of psychotic disorders (44) suggesting that adolescence is the
developmental period where adverse neuropsychiatric outcomes
from psychoactive substances are most likely to occur. There is
substantial though not conclusive evidence that the association
between tobacco smoking and SSD is causal and may well be
a result of the effects of nicotine on multiple neurotransmitter
systems. Therefore, policy makers must be cautious when
developing regulations for the availability of e-cigarettes, nicotine
replacement therapy products and smokeless tobacco. Similarly,
health practitioners who recommend e-cigarettes or smokeless
tobacco products as a safe alternative to smoking need to consider
the findings of the studies identified in this review, especially
when providing advice to adolescents.
It is essential that future well designed observational studies
are undertaken examining the risk of SSDs in those who use
e-cigarettes, particularly in adolescence. A major challenge is
the low prevalence of SSD. Recruiting samples large enough
to examine the association between e-cigarettes and SSD
will take many years. Previous longitudinal research has
shown positive associations between cannabis, tobacco and
alcohol use and psychotic experiences (PE) which are proxy
markers for psychosis risk. PE have the advantage of being
higher in prevalence compared to SSD thereby reducing the
required sample size to identify associations. Schizophrenia
endophenotypes may also have a role to inform the association
between nicotine exposure through e-cigarettes and risk of SSD.
Previous research has shown that smoking tobacco modulates

the association between polymorphisms of transcription factor 4
and reduced sensory gating, an endophenotype of schizophrenia
suggesting that the smoking of tobacco might play a role
in early information processing deficits in schizophrenia (45).
Use of research paradigms such as PE and endophenotypes
PE would expedite research into the association between e-
cigarette use and SSD risk. Further research is urgently needed
to determine if nicotine is causally associated with incident
SSD. In the interim, it is important that policy makers
consider the available evidence between tobacco smoking and
risk of schizophrenia when evaluating the potential health
consequences that might arise from community access to
e-cigarettes.
