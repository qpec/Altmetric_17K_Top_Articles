ABSTRACT
ObjeCtive
To test the hypothesis that postmenopausal women 
who increase their alcohol intake over a five year 
period have a higher risk of breast cancer and a lower 
risk of coronary heart disease compared with stable 
alcohol intake.
Design
Prospective cohort study.
setting
Denmark, 1993-2012.
PartiCiPants
21 523 postmenopausal women who participated in the 
Diet, Cancer, and Health Study in two consecutive 
examinations in 1993-98 and 1999-2003. Information 
on alcohol intake was obtained from questionnaires 
completed by participants.
Main OutCOMe Measures
Incidence of breast cancer, coronary heart disease, 
and all cause mortality during 11 years of follow-up. 
Information was obtained from the Danish Cancer 
Register, Danish Hospital Discharge Register, Danish 
Register of Causes of Death, and National Central 
Person Register. We estimated hazard ratios according 
to five year change in alcohol intake using Cox 
proportional hazards models.
results
During the study, 1054, 1750, and 2080 cases of breast 
cancer, coronary heart disease, and mortality 
occurred, respectively. Analyses modelling five year 
change in alcohol intake with cubic splines showed 
that women who increased their alcohol intake over 
the five year period had a higher risk of breast cancer 
and a lower risk of coronary heart disease than women 
with a stable alcohol intake. For instance, women who 
increased their alcohol intake by seven or 14 drinks per 
week (corresponding to one or two drinks more per 
day) had hazard ratios of breast cancer of 1.13 (95% 
confidence interval 1.03 to 1.23) and 1.29 (1.07 to 1.55), 
respectively, compared to women with stable intake, 
and adjusted for age, education, body mass index, 
smoking, Mediterranean diet score, parity, number of 
births, and hormone replacement therapy. For 
coronary heart disease, corresponding hazard ratios 
were 0.89 (0.81 to 0.97) and 0.78 (0.64 to 0.95), 
respectively, adjusted for age, education, body mass 
index, Mediterranean diet score, smoking, physical 
activity, hypertension, elevated cholesterol, and 
diabetes. Results among women who reduced their 
alcohol intake over the five year period were not 
significantly associated with risk of breast cancer or 
coronary heart disease. Analyses of all cause mortality 
showed that women who increased their alcohol 
intake from a high intake (≥14 drinks per week) to an 
even higher intake had a higher mortality risk that 
women with a stable high intake.
COnClusiOn
In this study of postmenopausal women over a five year 
period, results support the hypotheses that alcohol 
intake is associated with increased risk of breast cancer 
and decreased risk of coronary heart disease. 
Introduction
The effects of alcohol on the risk of breast cancer and 
coronary heart disease, two major diseases worldwide, 
have been thoroughly investigated over past decades 
and seem to be opposite. Studies have shown a direct 
relation between alcohol consumption and breast can-
cer,1-5 whereas the observed risk for coronary heart dis-
ease is lower among light to moderate drinkers than 
among abstainers.6 
7  Plausible biological mechanisms 
have been suggested for breast cancer2 
3 
8 
9 and coronary 
heart disease,10-13 which speak in favour of the causality 
of these findings. Regarding the association between 
alcohol intake and all cause mortality, studies have 
shown a U or J shaped association, suggesting that light 
to moderate alcohol intake has a protective effect, 
whereas both abstainers and heavy drinkers are at an 
increased risk.14-16
Most evidence is obtained from observational stud-
ies that correlate alcohol intake measured at one time 
point to the following disease incidence. Such results 
could be biased by confounding or by sick quitting 
(that is, individuals who give up drinking for reasons 
of ill health and are thus at higher risk).10 11 17 Long

term randomised trials providing important experi-
mental evidence could in principle offer the final 
answer, but owing to ethical and logistical reasons, 
such studies may never be conducted. Another step 
toward building on the evidence that alcohol is or is 
not a causal factor for breast cancer (increasing risk) 
and coronary heart disease (decreasing risk) is to 
examine whether a change in alcohol intake, defined 
by the difference in alcohol intake measured at two 
time points, results in a subsequent altered risk in 
hypothesised directions.18 Thus, in this study, we com-
pare changing and stable patterns of alcohol intake 
during a five year period in a prospectively followed 
cohort of postmenopausal women. We aimed to test 
the hypotheses that increased alcohol intake is associ-
ated with a higher risk of breast cancer and a lower 
risk of coronary heart disease compared with stable 
alcohol intake (and vice versa).
Methods
study population
From 1993 to 1997
, 79 729 women and 80 996 men, aged 
50-64 years, were invited to participate in the Diet, Can-
cer, and Health Study, a population cohort study. Eligi-
ble cohort members were born in Denmark, lived in the 
greater Copenhagen or Aarhus area, and had no previ-
ous cancers.19 Overall, 29 535 (37%) women agreed to 
participate in a study examination in 1993-98 and, of 
these, 23 796 (81%) agreed to participate again in a sec-
ond examination about five years later in 1999-2003.
We excluded 2273 premenopausal women (defined as 
women who, in the 1999-2003 examination, reported 
having had menstruations during the past year). The 
final study population for analyses of all cause mortal-
ity included 21 523 women. Women who were registered 
with a diagnosis of breast cancer (n=423) or coronary 
heart disease (n=884) at baseline (1999-2003) were 
excluded from analyses of breast cancer and coronary 
heart disease, respectively.
alcohol intake
A detailed food frequency questionnaire consisting of 
192 items was enclosed with the invitation to partici-
pate.20 This questionnaire was checked by an inter-
viewer during a clinic visit, when another questionnaire 
concerning lifestyle and background factors was com-
pleted. In the food frequency questionnaire, alcohol 
intake was reported as the average units of beer, wine, 
and spirits consumed over the preceding year. Total 
intake was calculated and converted into number of 
standard drinks, defined as containing 12 g of ethanol.
Covariates
Analyses were adjusted for known risk factors for breast 
cancer, coronary heart disease, and mortality. All esti-
mates were adjusted for school education (<8, 8-10, and 
≥11 years of school), body mass index (continuous), 
smoking (entered as two variables: a variable catego-
rised as never, past, and current smoker; and a contin-
uous variable for the number of grams of tobacco 
smoked per day), and the Mediterranean diet score 
(continuous).20 
21 
22 Estimates for breast cancer were fur-
ther adjusted for parity (parous or nulliparous) and 
number of births (continuous), and for use of hormone 
replacement therapy (never, past, and current). The 
estimates for coronary heart disease and mortality were 
further adjusted for physical activity (three indicator 
variables for performing the following activities weekly 
in leisure time: taking walks, bicycling, and undertak-
ing sports) as well as baseline hypertension, elevated 
cholesterol, and diabetes. Finally, the analyses of mor-
tality were also adjusted for self-reported health status 
(entered as a continuous variable consisting of five lev-
els of health status, ranging from level one being excel-
lent to level five being poor).
information on breast cancer, coronary heart 
disease, and all cause mortality
Information on breast cancer was obtained from the 
Danish Cancer Register,23 
24  which contains data on all 
cancer patients in Denmark. Information on coronary 
heart  
disease was obtained from the Danish Hospital 
Discharge Register25  and from the Danish Register of 
Causes of Death,26 
27  which contain information on hos-
pital admissions and causes of death in Denmark, 
respectively. In all three registers, diagnoses are classi-
fied according to the international classification of dis-
eases (ICD). The relevant ICD-10 code for breast cancer 
is C50. The relevant ICD-8 codes for coronary heart dis-
ease are 410-414, and the ICD-10 codes are I20-I25. The 
exact diagnosis for breast cancer has been validated,28 
 
and the validity of the Danish Hospital Discharge Regis-
ter is generally considered to be high.29 The registers 
were updated until 31 December 2012.
Information on vital status (including death) of the 
participants was obtained from the National Central 
Person Register. Participants were followed from base-
line in 1999-2003 until the date of outcome of interest 
(breast cancer, coronary heart disease, or death), emi-
gration, or end of follow-up on 31 December 2012, 
whichever came first.
statistical analysis
Analyses were performed using the Stata program 
software version 14. To account for missing values, we 
used multiple imputation by chained equations.30  For 
each outcome (breast cancer, coronary heart disease, 
and mortality), imputation models were run sepa-
rately, resulting in three datasets, each with 20 repeti-
tions. Potential confounders were imputed. Each 
imputation model included variables that were 
hypothesised to predict missing information (age, 
education, smoking, health status (hypertension, ele-
vated cholesterol, and diabetes)) and the respective 
outcome. Following imputation, the principle for data 
analysis was that estimation was performed on each 
imputation separately and then combined using 
Rubin’s rules.31 The number of missing values was 
nine (school education), 67 (body mass index), one 
(parity), 246 (hormone replacement therapy), 202 (tak-
ing walks), 123 (bicycling), 207 (undertaking sports), 
and 161 (self-reported health status). Thus, the number

of missing was low and a maximum of 1.1% (for hor-
mone replacement therapy).
We calculated risk estimates by using Cox propor-
tional hazards models with delayed entry. Age (in days) 
was used as the underlying time axis to ensure maximal 
adjustment for confounding by age. We examined the 
Cox proportional hazards assumption by plots of log(-
time) against log(−log(survival probability)) and statis-
tically by introducing interaction terms between age 
and change in alcohol intake in the model, with no vio-
lations detected.
Firstly, we examined main associations between 
alcohol intake at baseline (1999-2003) and risk of breast 
cancer, coronary heart disease, and all cause mortality 
in separate analyses using alcohol intake (drinks per 
week) in six categories to verify that the results were as 
expected. To test for U shape, alcohol was entered as a 
linear and a squared variable. The P value for the 
squared term denotes P for U shape. 
We then examined the association between combina-
tions of alcohol intake at the examinations in 1993-98 
and 1999-2003 (mean time 5.4 years (range 3.2-8.5)) and 
the subsequent risk of breast cancer, coronary heart dis-
ease, and all cause mortality. We used all possible com-
binations of alcohol intake in the two examinations (<7
, 
7-13, and ≥14 drinks per week), which yielded nine com-
binations of intake. Owing to a higher statistical power 
in the analysis of mortality, changes in alcohol intake 
here were defined by the possible combinations of alco-
hol intake in the two examinations (<7
, 7-13, 14-20, and 
≥21 drinks per week), which yielded 16 combinations of 
intake. A minimum change of one drink per week was 
required in order to change from one category of alco-
hol intake in the 1993-98 examination to another in the 
1999-2003 examination. Results from this analysis were 
presented with the reference defined by women with 
stable alcohol intake for each level of alcohol intake in 
the 1993-98 examination, and by stable light-drinkers 
(<7 drinks per week in both examinations), respectively.
Furthermore, we calculated the five year change in 
alcohol intake by subtracting the intake at the 1993-98 
examination from the intake at the 1999-2003 examina-
tion. Hence, a negative value represented a decrease in 
alcohol intake, while a positive value represented an 
increase. This variable was divided into seven catego-
ries (<−14, −14 to <−7
, −7 to <−1, −1 to <1, 1 to 6.9, 7 to 13.9, 
and ≥14 drinks per week). This analysis was carried out 
for breast cancer and coronary heart disease, with 
women with stable alcohol intake (change of −1 to <1 
drink per week) as the reference. Change in alcohol 
intake was also modelled continuously by cubic splines 
to account for non-linear associations.32 
33 To avoid out-
liers to influence results inexpediently, women who 
changed their alcohol intake outside the 0.5-99.5% per-
centiles of the distribution of change in alcohol intake 
were excluded (210 and 206 women for the analysis of 
breast cancer and coronary heart disease, respectively).
An underlying assumption in such analyses is that 
the risk is independent of the starting point in the 1993-
98 examination and only depends on the change, 
meaning that the risk of disease increases or decreases 
equally by a given change in alcohol intake. To test this 
assumption, we tested for interaction between change 
in alcohol intake and alcohol intake at the 1993-98 
examination. For this purpose, cross products between 
the five year change in alcohol intake in seven catego-
ries and alcohol intake in the 1993-98 examination con-
tinuously were entered in a model together with the 
main effects. However, because it was expected that a 
high alcohol intake in the 1993-98 examination could 
influence the subsequent risk of disease, despite a 
decrease in intake, the analyses were adjusted for alco-
hol intake in the 1993-98 examination. We also repeated 
analyses without adjusting for alcohol intake in the 
1993-98 examination.
Finally, we did several sensitivity analyses for breast 
cancer, coronary heart disease, and all cause mortality. 
These consisted of analyses that each omitted the first 
three years of follow-up (to reduce risk bias from sick 
quitters), excluded abstainers (women who did not 
drink any alcohol in either examination), and excluded 
all missing values. To take into account competing risks 
in analyses of breast cancer and coronary heart disease 
(that is, the fact that some women died during fol-
low-up before potentially having the disease in ques-
tion), we performed  
analyses of breast cancer and 
coronary heart disease by adjusting for competing 
risks. Around 9% of the women died during follow-up. 
For breast cancer, additional sensitivity analyses 
excluded women with a history of benign breast tumour 
surgery before baseline, adjusted for region (town), 
adjusted for changes in body mass index and use of hor-
mone replacement therapy between the examinations 
in 1993-98 and 1999-2003, and tested for interaction 
with hormone replacement therapy. For coronary heart 
disease, additional sensitivity analyses excluded 
women with any type of cardiovascular disease before 
baseline; omitted adjustments for hypertension, ele-
vated cholesterol, and diabetes; adjusted for changes in 
body mass index, smoking habits, hypertension, ele-
vated cholesterol, and diabetes between the examina-
tions in 1993-98 and 1999-2003; and tested for 
interaction with smoking. Finally, we repeated analyses 
for coronary heart disease, restricted to the diagnosis of 
myocardial infarction (ICD-8 code 410 and ICD-10 codes 
I21-I22) as the outcome. Regarding mortality, another 
sensitivity analysis adjusted for changes in body mass 
index, smoking habits, hypertension, elevated choles-
terol, and diabetes between study examinations.
Patient involvement
No patients were involved in setting the research ques-
tion or the outcome measures, nor were they involved in 
developing plans for recruitment, design, or implemen-
tation of the study. No patients were asked to advise on 
interpretation or writing up of results. There are no 
plans to disseminate the results of the research to study 
participants or the relevant patient community. 
Results
Mean follow-up time was 10.8 years for breast cancer, 
10.6 years for coronary heart disease, and 11.0 years for

all cause mortality (range for all outcomes 0.0-13.3 
years). During follow-up, 1054 cases of breast cancer 
and 1750 cases of coronary heart disease occurred, and 
2080 women died.
baseline characteristics
Among the 21 523 postmenopausal women included in 
the mortality analyses, the median alcohol intake was 
5.4 (5-95% range 0.3-23.6) and 4.8 (0.0-25.2) drinks per 
week in the 1993-98 and 1999-2003 examinations, 
respectively. The median five year change in alcohol 
intake was 0.0 (−10 to 12) drinks per week. In 1993-98, 
518 (2%) of women were abstainers, and in 1999-2003, 
this number was 1115 (5%).
Baseline characteristics can be seen in table 1. Mean 
age at baseline was 62 years and 36% of the women had 
a stable alcohol intake. In general, most covariates were 
equally distributed by change in alcohol intake. How-
ever, the proportion of women with a school education 
of shorter than eight years was highest among stable 
drinkers (35%), and the highest proportion of current 
smokers was found among women who decreased their 
alcohol intake by more than seven drinks per week 
(35%). This group also had the largest proportion of 
physically inactive women (14%).
baseline alcohol intake and risk of breast cancer, 
coronary heart disease, and all cause mortality
Table 2 presents the main associations between alcohol 
intake at baseline (1999-2003) and risk of breast cancer, 
coronary heart disease, and all cause mortality among 
study participants. As expected, a higher risk of breast 
cancer, a lower risk of coronary heart disease, and a U 
shaped association with mortality were observed with 
increasing alcohol intake.
breast cancer
Table 3 shows hazard ratios of breast cancer for nine 
combinations of alcohol intake in the 1993-98 and 1999-
2003 examinations. In general, results showed that 
postmenopausal women who increased their alcohol 
intake over the five year period had a subsequent higher 
risk of breast cancer than women with stable alcohol 
intake. In both examinations, women who increased 
their alcohol intake had raised risks for breast cancer 
(<7 to 7-13 drinks/week: hazard ratio 1.38 (95% confi-
dence interval 1.10 to 1.73); <7 to ≥14: 1.16 (0.81 to 1.67); 
7-13 to ≥14: 1.44 (1.12 to 1.86)) compared with women 
drinking fewer than seven drinks per week. For women 
who reduced their alcohol intake over the five year 
period, none of the hazard ratios was significantly asso-
ciated with breast cancer.
Figure 1 shows hazard ratios for breast cancer among 
postmenopausal women by five year change in alcohol 
intake with stable alcohol intake as reference, modelled 
as cubic splines (blue solid curve) and categories 
(stepped line). Women with increased alcohol intake 
had a subsequent higher risk of breast cancer compared 
to women with a stable alcohol intake. For instance, 
hazard ratios among women who increased their alco-
hol intake by seven and 14 drinks per week were 1.13 
(95% confidence interval 1.03 to 1.23) and 1.29 (1.07 to

, −7 to <−1, −1 to <1, 1 to 6.9, and 7 to 
13.9). However, in the extremes and especially for the 
category of at least 14 drinks per week, the spline curve 
and hazard ratio as estimated by categorical analysis 
diverged, most likely due to low statistical power. The 
interaction test between alcohol intake in the 1993-98 
examination and change in alcohol intake was not sig-
nificant (P=0.88). Repeating the analysis without 
adjusting for alcohol intake in the 1993-98 examination 
did not change results.
In the sensitivity analyses, we excluded women with 
a history of benign breast tumour surgery before base-
line (n=2867). However, this exclusion did not change 
the estimates substantially (data not shown). To 
explore whether the relatively high risk of breast can-
cer among women who decreased their alcohol intake 
was due to sick quitters, we performed an analysis 
omitting the first three years of follow-up. This analy-
sis did not affect results. Excluding abstainers (n=382) 
did not cause a change in estimates (data not shown), 
nor did excluding all of the originally missing values 
(n=312; data not shown). We repeated analyses taking 
into account competing risks from death, which 
caused changes in estimates of a maximum of 2% 
(data not shown). Adjusting analyses for smoking and 
region did not change the estimates (data not shown), 
nor did adjusting for changes in body mass index and 
use of hormone replacement therapy between the two

interaction between change in alcohol intake and use 
of hormone replacement therapy was not significant 
(P=0.34).
Coronary heart disease
Table 4 shows hazard ratios of coronary heart disease 
for nine combinations of alcohol intake in the 1993-98 
and 1999-2003 examinations. In general, results 
showed a tendency that postmenopausal women who 
increased their alcohol intake over the five year period 
had a subsequent lower risk of coronary heart disease 
than women with stable alcohol intake. Women with 
increased alcohol intake had hazard ratios for coro-
nary heart disease of 0.88 (95% confidence interval 
0.72 to 1.07; <7 to 7-13 drinks per week), 0.81 (0.60 to 
1.10; <7 to ≥14), and 0.65 (0.50 to 0.84; 7-13 to ≥14), 
compared with women drinking fewer than seven 
drinks per week in both examinations.. For women 
who decreased their alcohol intake between the two 
examinations, results were more ambiguous and all 
not significant.
Figure 2 shows the hazard of coronary heart disease 
among postmenopausal women by five year change in 
alcohol intake with stable alcohol intake as reference, 
modelled as cubic splines (blue solid curve) and cate-
gories (stepped line). The spline curve fitted the cate-
gorical analysis well. This analysis also showed that 
women who increased their alcohol intake between the 
two examinations had a lower risk of coronary heart 
disease than women with stable intake. For instance, 
women who increased their alcohol intake by seven or 
14 drinks per week had hazard ratio of 0.89 (95% confi-
dence interval 0.81 to 0.97) and 0.78 (0.64 to 0.95), 
respectively. For women who decreased their alcohol 
intake, results were not significant. The test for interac-
tion between alcohol intake in the 1993-98 examination 
and change in alcohol intake was also not significant 
(P=0.18). Repeating the analysis without adjusting for 
alcohol intake in the 1993-98 examination did not 
change results.
Several sensitivity analyses were performed, which 
did the following: 
• Excluded women with any type of cardiovascular dis-
ease before baseline (n=188)
• Omitted the first three years of follow-up
• Excluded abstainers (n=358)
• Excluded all originally missing values (n=506)
• Omitted adjustments for hypertension, elevated cho-
lesterol, and diabetes
• Adjusted for changes in body mass index, smoking 
habits, hypertension, elevated cholesterol, and dia-
betes between the two study examinations. 
All of these analyses caused minor changes in the 
results only (data not shown). Taking into account 
competing risks also did not cause changes in results 
(changes in estimates <2%, data not shown). A test 
for interaction with smoking was not significant 
(P=0.91). Finally, by repeating the analyses restrict-
ing the outcome to myocardial infarction only (483 
cases), the tendency in results remained, but confi-
dence intervals were wider. However, the overall test 
for the spline curve remained significant (P=0.02). 
Nonetheless, because the power of these analyses 
was limited, we used the broader definition of coro-
nary heart disease as the outcome in the main analy-
ses, being conscious that the validity of this diagnosis 
as an entity is lower.34

all cause mortality
The web table lists hazard ratios of all cause mortality 
among postmenopausal women for 16 combinations of 
alcohol intake in the 1993-98 and 1999-2003 examina-
tions. In general, results indicated that women who 
changed their alcohol intake from a moderate or high 
intake (that is, 7-13 or 14-20 drinks per week) to a low or 
heavy intake (that is, <7 or ≥21 drinks per week) had a 
higher mortality risk compared with women with a sta-
ble moderate or high intake. However, confidence inter-
vals were generally wide. We did sensitivity analyses 
similar to those performed for coronary heart disease, 
but these did not lead to results different from those 
presented in the web table.
The interaction test between alcohol intake in the 
1993-98 examination and five year change in alcohol 
intake was significant (P=0.03). Hence, the effect of 
change in alcohol intake depended on the starting 
point in 1993-98 and, as a consequence, five year change 
in alcohol intake was stratified by intake in the 1993-98 
examination (<7
, 7-13, and ≥14 drinks per week; web fig). 
Women who drank seven to 13 drinks per week in the 
1993-98 examination and reduced their intake by 3.6 
drinks per week or more had a significantly higher risk 
of mortality risk than women with a stable alcohol 
intake (that is, change in alcohol intake of 0 drinks per 
week; web fig 3B). Likewise, women who drank at least 
14 drinks per week in 1993-98 and who increased their 
intake by 7
.1 drinks per week or more had a significantly 
higher risk of mortality risk than women with a stable 
alcohol intake (web fig 3C). However, the main part of 
results from these analyses was ambiguous, probably 
due to the stratification on alcohol intake in the 1993-98 
examination leading to less statistical power.
discussion
Principal findings
Overall, results of this study showed that postmeno-
pausal women who increased their alcohol intake over 
a five year period had a higher risk of breast cancer and 
a lower risk of coronary heart disease than those women 
with a stable alcohol intake. Results among women 
who reduced their alcohol intake over the five year 
period were not significantly associated with risk of 
breast cancer or coronary heart disease. Analyses of all 
cause mortality showed—as expected—that women 
who increased their alcohol intake further from a high 
intake (≥14 drinks per week) had a higher mortality risk 
than women with a stable high intake.
strengths and limitations of the study
Strengths of the study included the prospective design 
minimising risk bias due to reverse causality and a large 
study size. Limitations included the fact that alcohol 
intake was self-reported and possibly underestimated, 
although the method is generally assumed to be valid6 
 
and studies comparing self-administered question-
naires with intake assessed by detailed diet records 
have shown no substantial dissimilarities.35 
36  In addi-
tion, the food frequency questionnaire used in this 
study was interviewer verified.20 Changes in alcohol 
intake might have occurred at any time between the two 
examinations, and women reporting a stable intake 
could have had variations in intake as well. Non-differ-
ential misclassification of alcohol intake was likely 
present at both examinations, leading to more random 
variation when studying change in alcohol intake com-
pared to studies using alcohol intake at one point in 
time only, leading to lower effective statistical power.
Concerning the definition and operationalisation of 
alcohol as exposure, a limitation is that drinking pat-
terns were not taken into account. Studies have shown 
an adverse effect of alcohol on coronary heart disease 
and increased risk of death when drinking in 
binges.10 
12 
37 
38 Hence, residual confounding from binge 
drinking could have influenced the results. Breast feed-
ing has consistently been associated with lower risk of 
breast cancer in epidemiological studies.39  Other repro-
ductive factors such as older age at menarche might 
also associate with risk, possibly depending on the 
breast cancer subtype 40 A weakness in our study was 
that we were unable to adjust for reproductive factors 
other than parity and number of births; if such factors 
were associated with change in alcohol intake, results 
could be biased due to residual confounding.
A common issue in observational studies is the risk of 
bias due to sick quitting.10 
11 
17 However, in this study, we 
did sensitivity analyses that excluded women with a 
history of benign breast tumour surgery before baseline 
from the analyses for breast cancer, and excluded 
women with any type of cardiovascular disease before 
baseline from the analyses for coronary heart disease. 
We also performed analyses in which we omitted the 
first three years of follow-up, and excluded abstainers, 
which did not change results.
We used coronary heart disease as an outcome, 
although the validity of the diagnosis of myocardial 
infarction is probably higher. In a validation study, 94% 
of myocardial infarction cases in the Danish Hospital 
Discharge Register and the Danish Register of Causes of 
Death were confirmed.41  Presumably, the validity of the 
diagnosis of coronary heart disease as an entity is 
lower.34 However, we found no differences in results 
when performing the analyses with myocardial infarc-
tion as the outcome instead of coronary heart disease.
A final limitation is that only 37% of the invited 
women participated in the first examination in 1993-98, 
and hence caution should be taken when generalising 
the findings. Women who chose to participate might 
have had a different risk profile and be in better health 
than those who declined to participate. Nonetheless, 
the studied associations will be biased only if non-re-
sponse is related to both the exposure (that is, change 
in alcohol intake) and the outcome of the study (that is, 
breast cancer or coronary heart disease). Recent studies 
seem to indicate that non-responders have higher rates 
of alcohol related mortality and morbidity.42  But in this 
study, the range of variation in the information col-
lected on alcohol and other lifestyle risk factors was 
similar to previous Danish studies,19 and the observed 
incidences of breast cancer and coronary heart disease 
did not differ from those of the general population.

Potential mechanisms
Biological mechanisms explaining the relation between 
alcohol intake and risk of breast cancer are complex. 
One of the most common hypotheses is that alcohol 
increases breast cancer risk via alterations in circulat-
ing oestrogen levels.8 
9 
43  Another hypothesis concerns 
alcohol metabolism by which alcohol is converted to 
acetaldehyde by alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH), which, 
for example, is expressed in the breast tissue. Acetalde-
hyde is genotoxic and is considered to increase breast 
cancer risk by several mechanisms, for instance by 
damaging DNA.2 
3 
8  Evidence linking alcohol to a lower 
risk of coronary heart disease includes alcohol 
increased levels of high density lipoprotein cholesterol, 
reduced levels of fibrinogen, and inhibited platelet acti-
vation in experimental studies, mechanisms that theo-
retically contribute to a beneficial effect.10-13 However, 
this evidence is ambiguous.44 45 In addition, a large 
scale Mendelian randomisation study (sometimes 
referred to as nature’s randomised trial) of alcohol 
intake and coronary heart disease demonstrated that 
carriers of the A allele of ADH1B (rs1229984), a genetic 
variant associated with non-drinking and lower alcohol 
consumption, had lower odds of coronary heart dis-
ease.45 This result might add scepticism to the alleged 
protective effects of alcohol on the risk of coronary 
heart disease.
Because the development of breast cancer is assumed 
to happen over years,8  there might be a temporal issue 
in addressing the effect of a change in alcohol intake 
over a period of five years only. Nonetheless, a Danish 
study suggested that recent alcohol intake might be a 
more important determinant of postmenopausal breast 
cancer risk than earlier exposure.46  Other studies found 
that alcohol drinking throughout adult life was associ-
ated with higher risk of breast cancer,47  and that alco-
hol intake at baseline was more important than alcohol 
intake at a later time point.48 Compared to the results of 
our study, the effect of change in alcohol intake on the 
risk of breast cancer and coronary heart disease was 
independent of alcohol intake at the starting point in 
the 1993-98 examination. However, we did not take life-
time alcohol consumption into account, and also were 
unable to account for changes in alcohol intake during 
follow-up.
Comparison with other studies
To the best of our knowledge, no previous studies have 
investigated the association between change in alcohol 
intake and risk of breast cancer, whereas a few studies, 
also including women, have addressed the risk of coro-
nary heart disease. Okwuosa and colleagues studied 
long term changes in alcohol consumption status and 
variations in fibrinogen levels in a cohort of 2520 young 
men and women.49 Compared with participants who 
never drank, those who became or stayed drinkers had 
smaller increases in fibrinogen, while those who quit 
drinking had the highest increase over 13 years of fol-
low-up. 
King and colleagues followed a cohort of 7697 men 
and women aged 45-64 years who were non-drinkers 
at baseline over a 10 year period.50  Within six years, 
6.0% of participants began moderate alcohol con-
sumption, and 0.4% began heavier drinking. After 
four years of follow-up, new moderate drinkers had a 
38% lower risk of cardiovascular disease than the per-
sistently non-drinking participants. In a longitudinal 
population based study, Grønbaek and researchers 
studied changes in alcohol intake over a five year 
period and mortality in 6644 men and 8010 women 
aged 25-98 years.18 For coronary heart disease mortal-
ity, stable non-drinkers had a relative risk of 1.32 (95% 
confidence interval 0.97 to 1.79) compared with stable 
light drinkers, those who had decreased their drink-
ing from light to none increased their risk (1.40 (1.00 
to 1.95)), and those who had increased from 
non-drinking to light drinking decreased their risk 
(0.71 (0.44 to 1.14)). 
In addition, Lazarus and colleagues studied changes 
in alcohol consumption and risk of death from ischemic 
heart disease in 1845 men and 2225 women aged 35 
years and older.51  There was a significantly higher risk 
of death from ischaemic heart disease in women who 
gave up drinking between 1965 and 1974 than in women 
who continued to drink (relative risk 2.75 (95% confi-
dence interval 1.44 to 5.23)). Furthermore, several stud-
ies that only included men have also examined the 
association between change in alcohol intake and coro-
nary heart disease.52-57
implications
Our study prepares the ground for future research 
aimed to clarify whether our observed associations 
can be seen in other study populations. In addition, 
more research is needed concerning the biological 
mechanisms behind the relation between alcohol 
intake and breast cancer. For instance, this might 
help to elucidate the influence of time of exposure, 
which could be an important factor when giving pub-
lic health advice.
In terms of public health implications of this study, 
our findings suggest increased risks of breast cancer 
following an increase in alcohol intake compared to a 
stable intake, whereas a decreased risk of coronary 
heart disease was observed. However, in the broader 
picture, additional analyses on all cause mortality 
support current recommendations of a light to moder-
ate intake.
Conclusions
Postmenopausal women who increased their alcohol 
intake over a five year period between the 1993-98 and 
1999-2003 examinations in the Diet, Cancer, and Health 
Study had a higher risk of breast cancer and a lower risk 
of coronary heart disease compared with women with a 
stable alcohol intake. Results among women who 
decreased their alcohol intake over the five year period 
were not significantly associated with risk of breast can-
cer or coronary heart disease. Analyses of all cause mor-
tality indicated that women who increased their alcohol 
intake further from a high intake (that is, from ≥14 
drinks per week) had a higher mortality risk than
