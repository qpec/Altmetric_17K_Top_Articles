Abstract
Background: Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is associated with hepatocellular carcinoma and non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma.
In 2009, MD Anderson established the first US clinic for treating HCV-infected cancer patients, where we observed an
unexpectedly large number of patients with head and neck cancers (HNCs). We sought to determine whether HCV is
associated with HNCs.
Methods: In this case-control study, medical records of cancer patients tested for HCV antibodies at our center from 2004
through 2014 were identified. Case subjects had new-onset primary oropharyngeal or nonoropharyngeal (oral cavity,
nasopharynx, hypopharynx, or larynx) HNCs. Control subjects had smoking-associated (lung, esophagus, or urinary bladder)
cancers. Biopsy reports of oropharyngeal cancers tested for human papillomavirus (HPV) were reviewed. Patients with
lymphoma were excluded. Multivariable logistic regression models were constructed. All statistical tests were two-sided.
Results: Of 34 545 cancer patients tested for HCV antibodies, 409 case subjects (164 oropharyngeal and 245 nonoropharyngeal)
and 694 control subjects (378 lung, 168 esophagus, and 148 urinary bladder) were studied. The prevalence of HCV seropositivity
was higher in oropharyngeal cancer patients (14.0%, 95% confidence interval [CI] ¼ 8.7% to 19.4%, vs 6.5%, 95% CI¼ 4.6% to 8.3%),
particularly HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancer patients (16.9%, 95% CI¼ 8.7% to 24.9%, vs 6.5%, 95% CI ¼ 4.6% to 8.3%), and
nonoropharyngeal HNC patients (20.0%, 95% CI¼ 14.9% to 25.0%, vs 6.5%, 95% CI¼ 4.6% to 8.3%) than in control subjects. Adjusted
models showed a statistically significant association of HCV seropositivity with nonoropharyngeal (except nasopharyngeal)
HNCs (odds ratio [OR] ¼ 2.85, 95% CI¼ 1.38 to 5.88) and HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancers (OR ¼ 2.97, 95% CI ¼ 1.31 to 6.76).
Conclusions: HCV is associated with nonoropharyngeal (except nasopharyngeal) and HPV-positive oropharyngeal HNCs.
Further studies are required to explore the possible interaction between HCV and HPV, and the association between HCV and
other HPV-related malignancies.
Approximately 2.7 to 3.9 million individuals in the United States
(up to 1.5% of the population) are chronically infected with
hepatitis
C
virus
(HCV)
(1).
HCV
is
carcinogenic,
and
HCV-seropositive individuals have 15 to 20 times the risk of de-
veloping hepatocellular carcinoma that HCV-seronegative indi-
viduals have (2). Chronic HCV infection causes not only liver
cancer but also lymphoproliferative disorders (3–5).
Clinical and epidemiological evidence supports a statistically
significant association between HCV infection and development
of several types of B-cell non-Hodgkin’s lymphomas (6–8).
Additionally, a recent analysis of data from the Chronic
Hepatitis C Cohort Study showed that HCV-infected individuals
also have increased incidences of other non-liver-related malig-
nancies, including pancreas, lung, renal, and rectal cancers,

 along with increased cancer-associated mortality (9). Likewise,
a prospective study from Taiwan showed increased mortality
from extrahepatic diseases in HCV-seropositive individuals (10).
In 2009, we established the first US clinic devoted to manag-
ing HCV infection in cancer patients (11), where we observed an
unexpectedly large number of patients with head and neck can-
cers (HNCs). In this study, we sought to determine whether HCV
seropositivity is associated with oropharyngeal and nonoro-
pharyngeal HNCs.
Methods
Study Design and Patient Population
We conducted a case-control study. After obtaining approval
from our institution’s institutional review “board” (IRB), we
identified medical records of all cancer patients age 18 years old
and older at cancer diagnosis seen at our institution and tested
for HCV antibodies between June 1, 2004, and May 31, 2014. A
waiver for the written informed consent was obtained from the
IRB because this study was a retrospective evaluation of the pa-
tients’ information and did not involve more than minimal risk
to the subjects. Using the Clinical Informatics database, we ob-
tained data on the sites and histopathological diagnoses of can-
cers in these patients. We selected patients with HNCs as case
subjects and divided them into two groups with different cancer
etiologies: patients with oropharyngeal and patients with non-
oropharyngeal (oral cavity, nasopharynx, hypopharynx, and lar-
ynx) cancers (Figure 1). The tumor sites and International
Classification of Diseases for Oncology topographical codes for
the case subjects are presented in Supplementary Table 1 (avail-
able online) (12). As smoking is a major risk factor for HNCs (13),
we selected as the control group patients with three major
smoking-associated
cancers—lung,
esophagus,
and
urinary
bladder (14)—to balance the distribution of smoking-related risk
factors between case and control groups (Figure 1). All cancer di-
agnoses were histopathologically confirmed at our center.
Because HCV infection is associated with B-cell non-Hodgkin’s
lymphoma, we excluded patients with lymphoma.
Ascertainment of Exposures and Covariates
Patients
with
HCV
were
identified
using
International
Classification of Diseases (ninth revision) codes for HCV infection
(070.41, 070.44, 070.51, 070.54, 070.70, 070.71, or V02.62), and the
diagnosis was verified by medical records review. HCV seroposi-
tivity was defined as detectable HCV antibody in serum. Patients
were tested for HCV antibodies using the ORTHO HCV Version 3.0
ensyme-linked
immunosorbent
assay
(ELISA;
Ortho-Clinical
Diagnostics, Raritan, NJ) from 2004 to 2007 and the ABBOTT
PRISM HCV assay (Abbott Park, IL) from 2007 to 2014 (screening
tests were changed in 2007 by the institution). Both tests are US
Food and Drug Administration–approved, commercially available
assays with specificity greater than 99% (15,16). HCV infection
was defined as detectable HCV RNA in serum. HCV RNA was
tested by Cobas TaqMan HCV Monitor version 1.0 or 2.0 assay
(Roche Molecular Systems, Branchburg, NJ). Data on co-infections
with hepatitis B virus (HBV) and HIV were also obtained. HBV ex-
posure was defined as positivity for HBV core antibody, and HIV
infection was defined as positivity for HIV antibody.
From the standardized questionnaire administered to all pa-
tients at their first visit at our institution, we extracted data on de-
mographics,
including
birth
year,
highest
education
level
(surrogate for socioeconomic status), cigarette smoking, and alco-
hol consumption. Smoking-related information collected included
smoking status (never, former, or current smoker), age at starting/
quitting smoking, number of years of smoking, number of ciga-
rettes smoked per day, and duration of smoking in pack-years
(number of cigarette packs smoked per day multiplied by number
of years smoked). Never smokers were those who smoked fewer
than 100 cigarettes in their lifetime. Former smokers were those
who had quit at least one year before cancer diagnosis. Alcohol-re-
lated information collected included drinking status (never, for-
mer, or current drinker), age at starting/quitting alcohol drinking,
number of years of drinking, and number of alcoholic drinks con-
sumed per week, with a standard drink defined as 4 ounces for
wine, 12 ounces for beer, and 1.5 ounces for hard liquor (17).
Pathology reports of all case subjects were reviewed in our
center to determine whether tumors were positive for human
papillomavirus (HPV) or Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). HPV p16 pro-
tein expression was examined using immunohistochemistry,
and the presence of high-risk HPV types (16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45,
51, 52, 56, 58, and 66) was examined using in situ hybridization
(18). Oropharyngeal cancers were considered HPV positive if
high-risk HPV tumors were positive for p16. Tumors were tested
for EBV-encoded RNA using in situ hybridization (19).
Statistical Analyses
We conducted different analyses to determine whether HCV se-
ropositivity was associated with oropharyngeal or nonorophar-
yngeal HNCs. We separately compared characteristics of the
two case groups and the control group. Categorical variables
were compared using Pearson’s chi-squared test or Fisher’s ex-
act
test,
and
continuous
variables
were
compared
using
Wilcoxon rank-sum test (for non-normal distributions).
Univariate logistic regression analysis was conducted to ex-
amine the association between HCV seropositivity and the case
group. Potential confounders were assessed by introducing
them in the model, and we included variables that changed the
estimates by 10% or more in the adjusted model. Final adjusted
multivariable logistic regression models were constructed and
the most parsimonious models selected using Akaike informa-
tion criterion. We reported the effect sizes as odds ratios (ORs)
and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and P values.
To account for different pathogenesis of cancers, we conducted
subgroup analyses to determine the associations between HCV se-
ropositivity and oropharyngeal cancers, according to HPV status,
and nasopharyngeal cancers. We performed sensitivity analyses
and evaluated the associations by including only patients with
HCV infection. Finally, in an exploratory analysis, we fit separate
unconditional logistic regression models for each HNC subsite and
adjusted for potential confounders. We corrected the P values for
multiple comparisons using a false-discovery rate of 10% accord-
ing to the Benjamini and Hochberg method (20).
All statistical tests were two-sided, and P values of less than
.05 were considered statistically significant. Statistical analyses
were conducted using Stata/IC software, version 13.0 (StataCorp
LP, College Station, TX).

 as case subjects (n ¼ 409: 164 oropharyngeal and 245 nonoro-
pharyngeal) or control subjects (n ¼ 694: 378 lung, 168 esopha-
gus, and 148 urinary bladder) (Figure 1). Patient characteristics
are summarized in Table 1. Most patients were male, white, and
born between 1945 and 1965; the median age at cancer diagno-
sis was 62 years. Approximately 41.1% of patients had a bache-
lor’s degree or beyond, 49.0% were former smokers, and
52.3% current alcohol drinkers at cancer diagnosis. In the overall
sample of case and control subjects, the prevalence of HCV se-
ropositivity was 10.6% (n ¼ 117, 95% CI ¼ 8.9% to 12.5%), and
86.4% (n ¼ 76 of 88, 95% CI ¼ 79.2% to 93.5%) of those tested for
HCV RNA had HCV infection. Of the 145 patients whose cancers
were tested for HPV, 70 had high-risk HPV and 83 had p16-posi-
tive tumors.
Oropharyngeal Cancers
Compared with control subjects, oropharyngeal cancer patients
were more likely to be male, born between 1945 and 1965, diag-
nosed with cancer at younger ages, and better educated; to have
smoked
fewer
cigarettes;
and
to
consume
more
alcohol
(Table 2). There was no statistically significant difference be-
tween groups with respect to HBV exposure or HIV.
Compared with control subjects, HPV-positive oropharyngeal
cancer patients were more likely to be white, male, born between
1945 and 1965, diagnosed with cancer at younger ages, and better
educated; and to have smoked fewer cigarettes (Table 3).
The prevalence of HCV seropositivity was higher in oropha-
ryngeal cancer patients than control subjects (14.0%, 95%

 CI ¼ 8.7 to 19.4%, vs 6.5%, 95% CI ¼ 4.6 to 8.3%), particularly HPV-
positive oropharyngeal cancer patients (16.9%, 95% CI ¼ 8.7 to
24.9%, vs 6.5%, 95% CI ¼ 4.6 to 8.3%). After adjustment for age at
cancer diagnosis, birth between 1945 and 1965, sex, highest edu-
cation level, smoking history, and alcohol consumption, HCV
seropositivity was statistically significantly associated with oro-
pharyngeal cancer (OR ¼ 2.04, 95% CI ¼ 1.04 to 4.01) (Table 4).
Because they have different pathogenesis, we conducted sepa-
rate analyses for HPV-positive and HPV-negative oropharyngeal
cancers. Final adjusted models showed a statistically significant
association
between
HCV
seropositivity
and
HPV-positive
(OR ¼ 2.97, 95% CI ¼ 1.31 to 6.76) but not HPV-negative oropha-
ryngeal cancers (OR ¼ 1.44, 95% CI ¼ 0.39 to 5.30) (Table 4).
Similar results were obtained with sensitivity analysis for HCV
infection (Table 4).
Nonoropharyngeal HNCs
Compared with control subjects, nonoropharyngeal HNC pa-
tients were more likely to be male, be diagnosed with cancer at
younger ages, consume more alcohol, and have HIV co-infection
(Table 2). There was no statistically significant difference be-
tween
groups
with
respect
to
cigarette
smoking
or
HBV
exposure.
The prevalence of HCV seropositivity was higher in nonoro-
pharyngeal HNC patients than control subjects (20.0%, 95%
CI ¼ 14.9 to 25.0%, vs 6.5%, 95% CI ¼ 4.6 to 8.3%). After adjust-
ment for age at cancer diagnosis, birth between 1945 and 1965,

cally

with

HNC
(OR ¼ 2.85, 95% CI ¼ 1.38 to 5.88) (Table 4). Within nonorophar-
yngeal HNCs, we conducted separate analyses for non-naso-
pharyngeal and nasopharyngeal cancer patients. Final adjusted
models showed a statistically significant association between
HCV seropositivity and non-nasopharyngeal (OR ¼ 3.17, 95%
CI ¼ 1.49 to 6.73) but not nasopharyngeal cancers (OR ¼ 1.30, 95%
CI ¼ 0.22 to 7.64) (Table 4). Similar results were obtained with
sensitivity analysis for HCV infection (Table 4). Associations by
EBV status could not be evaluated because of the small number
of EBV-positive patients in each cancer group.
Case-Case Analyses
We performed case-case analyses by comparing HPV-positive to
HPV-negative oropharyngeal cancers and, within nonorophar-
yngeal HNCs, non-nasopharyngeal to nasopharyngeal cancers to
assess etiologic heterogeneity. We found no statistically signifi-
cant association of HCV seropositivity with HPV-positive com-
pared with HPV-negative oropharyngeal cancers (OR ¼ 1.56, 95%
CI¼ 0.32 to 7.52, P ¼ .58) and no statistically significant associa-
tion of HCV seropositivity with non-nasopharyngeal compared
with nasopharyngeal cancers (OR ¼ 1.25, 95% CI¼ 0.19 to 8.33,
P ¼ .82) after adjusting for the confounders mentioned above.
Exploratory Analyses
After adjustment for age at cancer diagnosis, birth between 1945
and 1965, sex, highest education level, smoking, and alcohol
consumption, HCV seropositivity was statistically significantly
associated with oral cavity, oropharyngeal, and laryngeal can-
cers after corrections for multiple comparisons (Table 5).
Unfortunately, the numbers of patients with tumors of the naso-
pharynx, hypopharynx, and larynx tested for HCV RNA were too
small to permit analysis of any association with HCV infection.
Discussion
This
case-control
study
conducted
at
a
National
Cancer
Institute–designated cancer center is the first to show that HCV
is statistically significantly associated not only with nonoro-
pharyngeal (except nasopharyngeal) HNCs but also with HPV-
positive oropharyngeal cancers. Our results add to the growing
body of epidemiological evidence that HCV infection has extra-
hepatic manifestations and may be associated with non-liver-
related cancers (9,21).

 Our findings are clinically significant. HCV infection is asso-
ciated with several types of B-cell non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma,
especially the diffuse large B-cell, marginal zone, follicular, and
lymphoplasmacytic types (6–8,22). The reported odds ratios for
these associations range from 2.47 to 5.2 (6,22). We found a sim-
ilar strength of association between HCV and nonoropharyngeal
HNCs
and
between
HCV
and
HPV-positive
oropharyngeal
cancers. Thus, clinicians should be aware that nonliver cancers
besides non-Hodgkin’s lymphomas can develop in patients
chronically infected with HCV. Additionally, oncologists treat-
ing patients with HNCs should consider testing patients for HCV
to enable early identification and linkage of care for this infec-
tion and to prevent progression of underlying liver disease. It re-
mains unknown whether early HCV treatment may prevent
development of HCV-associated HNCs or improve the oncologic
outcome of patients in whom such cancers develop as has been
reported in patients with HCV-associated non-Hodgkin’s lym-
phoma (6–8,23).
HNCs are a heterogeneous group of cancers accounting for
approximately 3% of all cancers diagnosed in the United States
(24). Risk factors for these cancers include smoking, alcohol con-
sumption, chewing betel nut, African American race, low socio-
economic status, HPV infection (for oropharyngeal cancers), and
EBV infection (for nasopharyngeal cancers) (13,25,26).
Little has previously been published about the relationship
between HCV infection and HNCs. A few articles suggest that
HCV infection may be associated with squamous cell carcino-
mas of the oral cavity (27,28). A US study showed a higher HCV
prevalence in patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the
head and neck than in noncancer patients (21.2% vs 9.9%, P <
.004) (27). A population-based study from Taiwan found that the
incidence of oral cavity cancers was 2.28 times as high in HCV-
infected individuals as in patients with nonviral hepatitis (6.15
vs 2.69 per 100 000 person-years) and that HCV alone was a sta-
tistically significant risk factor for oral cavity cancers (HR ¼ 1.9)
(28). Recently, the US population-wide Chronic Hepatitis C
Cohort Study analyzed data on 12 126 patients with chronic
HCV infection and found that such patients had an increased
incidence of oral cavity cancers (standardized rate ratio ¼ 2.5)
and mortality from oral cavity cancers (relative risk ¼ 5.2) com-
pared with noninfected patients (9). In our present study, HCV
seropositivity was associated not only with nonoropharyngeal
HNCs but also with HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancers. Our re-
sults also confirmed that HCV seropositivity was associated
with oral cavity cancers, as previously reported (27,28).
The mechanisms by which HCV may be associated with
HNCs remain unclear and need further investigation. HCV has
been detected in saliva and salivary glands in patients with
chronic
sialadenitis
and
salivary
gland
tumors
(29).
Furthermore, an extrahepatic manifestation of chronic HCV in-
fection is oral lichen planus, which is a premalignant condition
associated with development of squamous cell carcinoma of
the oral cavity (30). Case reports also have described progression
of lichen planus to squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity
in HCV-infected patients (30,31). Enhanced replication of HCV in
oropharyngeal tissues may contribute to chronic inflammation
predisposing to cancer development.
A novel finding from our study was that HCV seropositivity
was associated with HPV-positive but not HPV-negative oropha-
ryngeal cancers. HPV persists as a chronic infection, in part, by
evading antiviral immune responses (32). High-risk HPV types
have been shown to downregulate interferon-a-inducible gene
expression (32). HPV oncoproteins E6 and E7 directly interact
with and inhibit type 1 interferon signaling (32), which plays a
central role in controlling intracellular replication of HCV (32).
Thus, HPV may facilitate proliferation of HCV in the oropharyn-
geal cells, thereby facilitating its oncogenic action.
The role of HCV in oropharyngeal carcinogenesis may also
relate to direct involvement of HCV proteins, including HCV
nonstructural proteins NS5B and NS3 and HCV core proteins, in
disrupting cell cycle regulation. NS5B binds the retinoblastoma
tumor suppressor protein (Rb) in the cytoplasm of infected cells
and recruits E6-associated protein, leading to polyubiquitina-
tion and proteasomal degradation of Rb (33). Because Rb is criti-
cal in regulating G1-S cell cycle transition, DNA damage
response, mitotic spindle checkpoints, and apoptosis, loss of Rb
may lead to uncontrolled cell proliferation (33). Notably, HPV
protein E6 also exerts a pro-oncogenic impact by targeting tu-
mor suppressor proteins through E6-associated protein, leading
to degradation of cellular p53 and enhanced phosphorylation of
Rb (34). Various interactions of HCV core and NS3 proteins with
p53 have also been documented (33). The loss of p53 induced by
HPV E6 protein and the degradation of Rb caused by HCV NS5B
protein may play a synergistic role in the development of oro-
pharyngeal cancers and merits further investigation. Additional
studies are also warranted to examine the association between
HCV and HPV-related anogenital (cervix, vagina, vulva, penis,
and anus) cancers.
Another novel finding of our study was that HCV seroposi-
tivity was associated with laryngeal cancers. Risk factors previ-
ously identified for laryngeal cancers include smoking, alcohol
intake, injection drug use, gastroesophageal reflux, and occupa-
tional exposures like asbestos (35,36). Of interest, recent studies
have shown an association between HPV infection and laryn-
geal cancers (37–39). The association of HCV with laryngeal can-
cers may be because of mechanisms similar to those described
above for HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancers. Correlation be-
tween smoking and/or drug use could partially explain the asso-
ciation of HCV with laryngeal cancers. However, detailed
evaluation of risk factors for laryngeal cancers, including testing
of cancers for HPV, was not possible because of lack of data.
Our study had several strengths. We evaluated the largest
series of oropharyngeal and nonoropharyngeal HNCs for evalu-
ating associations with HCV as separate groups because their
risk factors differ. All cancers in our study population were his-
topathologically confirmed. The sensitivity analyses that in-
cluded only subjects who had HCV infection (detectable HCV
RNA) improved the validity of our findings. We evaluated smok-
ing and alcohol consumption in detail and adjusted for them in
final analyses, an approach not previously taken and often diffi-
cult through population-based databases and cancer registries.
We also utilized existing data on HPV status of oropharyngeal
cancers and found that HCV was associated with HPV-positive
oropharyngeal cancers, suggesting oncogenic synergy between
the two chronic viral infections.
Our study also had several limitations. First, the control
group was not cancer free; rather, control subjects were patients
with any of the three major smoking-associated cancers. In this
retrospective study, we did not have access to a cancer-free
population. We selected this control group so that case and con-
trol subjects were similar with respect to major risk factors—
smoking, alcohol, and socioeconomic status—and adjusted for
them in the final analyses. Second, since we used hospital-
based control subjects, there was a possibility of Berkson’s bias,
which pertains to different exposure rates in the control group
and the general population (40). Notably, the prevalence of HCV
infection in our control group was 6%, higher than the preva-
lence of approximately 1.5% in the general US population (1).

 Thus, our results may actually underestimate the true effect
size of the association between HCV seropositivity and HNCs.
An alternate explanation is that the HCV seropositivity rate is
higher in cancer patients than in the general population. Third,
there is the possibility of selection bias as patients with solid tu-
mors are not routinely tested for HCV antibodies in our center.
However, the proportions of cancer patients seen at our institu-
tion during the study period who were tested for HCV antibod-
ies
did
not
differ
among
the
case
and
control
groups
(Supplementary Table 2, available online). Nevertheless, bias re-
sulting from different reasons for HCV screening in case and
control groups may be possible. Fourth, the association between
HCV and HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancers may reflect a cor-
relation between HCV and HPV infection because of lifestyle be-
haviors. Both HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancer patients and
HCV-infected individuals tend to have high numbers of lifetime
sex partners (41,42). However, whereas HPV is mostly transmit-
ted sexually, sexual transmission of HCV infection is extremely
rare, with the incidence being one case per 190 000 sexual con-
tacts among heterosexual couples (43); the most frequent route
of HCV transmission is injection drug use (44). Thus, this pre-
sumed correlation between HCV and HPV infection may reflect
correlation between the two high-risk behaviors. Because of the
retrospective nature of our study and the nonavailability of reli-
able assessments of sexual and drug use history, evaluation of
such behaviors was not possible. Fifth, we did not have data on
HCV treatment in our study subjects. Because population-based
studies have shown that most HCV-infected patients are not
aware of their infection and healthcare utilization rates are low
for patients with HCV infection (42), we believe that lack of HCV
treatment data is unlikely to affect our results. Sixth, more than
50% of the patients in our study were born between 1945 and
1965; individuals born during that period have a high prevalence
of HCV infection (1). However, because the recommendations for
screening such individuals were made in 2012 (1) and our study
included patients tested between 2004 and 2014, we believe that
birth between 1945 and 1965 is unlikely to have been the reason
for HCV testing for the majority of patients in our study popula-
tion. Nevertheless, our results were adjusted for the birth cohort
effect in our multivariable analyses. Seventh, even though we
tried to adjust for smoking, alcohol intake, and socioeconomic
status, data were obtained from self-reported questionnaires and
underreporting or misreporting of information along with resid-
ual confounding is possible. Eighth, the case-case analyses
showed no etiologic heterogeneity between the case groups com-
pared with respect to HCV seropositivity; however, the number of
patients in comparison groups was small to determine differ-
ences. Finally, we were unable to evaluate the association be-
tween HCV and nasopharyngeal cancers based on EBV status
because of small sample size.
In conclusion, HCV seems to be associated with HNCs, par-
ticularly nonoropharyngeal and HPV-positive oropharyngeal
cancers. Validation of these associations by analysis of popula-
tion-based datasets and cancer-free control group is essential.
Further studies are also required to explore the possible interac-
tion between HCV and HPV and the association between HCV
and other HPV-related malignancies.
