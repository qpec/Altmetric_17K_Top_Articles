Abstract
Objective: Depression screening among children and adolescents is controversial, and no clinical trials have evaluated
benefits and harms of screening programs. A requirement for effective screening is a screening tool with demonstrated high
accuracy. The objective of this systematic review was to evaluate the accuracy of depression screening instruments to detect
major depressive disorder (MDD) in children and adolescents.
Method: Data sources included the MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process, EMBASE, PsycINFO, HaPI, and LILACS databases
from 2006 to September 30, 2015. Eligible studies compared a depression screening tool to a validated diagnostic interview
for MDD and reported accuracy data for children and adolescents aged 6 to 18 years. Risk of bias was assessed with
QUADAS-2.
Results: We identified 17 studies with data on 20 depression screening tools. Few studies examined the accuracy of the same
screening tools. Cut-off scores identified as optimal were inconsistent across studies. Width of 95% confidence intervals (CIs)
for sensitivity ranged from 9% to 55% (median 32%), and only 1 study had a lower bound 95% CI �80%. For specificity, 95% CI
width ranged from 2% to 27% (median 9%), and 3 studies had a lower bound �90%. Methodological limitations included small
sample sizes, exploratory data analyses to identify optimal cut-offs, and the failure to exclude children and adolescents already
diagnosed or treated for depression.
Conclusions: There is insufficient evidence that any depression screening tool and cut-off accurately screens for
MDD in children and adolescents. Screening could lead to overdiagnosis and the consumption of scarce health care
resources.

depression, screening, children, adolescents, diagnostic accuracy
Screening children and adolescents for depression is contro-
versial. In 2009, the United States Preventive Services Task
Force (USPSTF) recommended that adolescents, but not
younger children, should be routinely screened for depres-
sion in primary care settings when depression care systems
are in place to ensure accurate diagnosis, treatment, and fol-
low-up.1 The USPSTF recently reiterated this recommenda-
tion in its 2016 guideline.2 By contrast, depression screening
among children and adolescents has not been recommended in
the United Kingdom or Canada.3,4 No clinical trials have
evaluated depression screening programs among children or
adolescents,2 and there are no examples of well-conducted
trials among adults that have shown that depression screening
would improve mental health outcomes.5-8
Depression screening, if initiated in practice, would
involve the use of self-report questionnaires to identify chil-
dren or adolescents who may have depression but have not
otherwise been identified as possibly depressed by health
care professionals or via self-report.9,10 Health care profes-
sionals would need to administer a screening tool and use a
predetermined cut-off score to separate children and adoles-
cents who may have depression from those unlikely to have
depression. Screening, which would be done with all children
and adolescents who are not suspected of having depression,
is different from case finding, which is only done with
patients who health care professionals believe are at risk.10
In screening, tools must be accurate enough to identify a
large proportion of unrecognized depression cases and to
effectively rule out noncases to avoid unnecessary mental
health assessments and the possibility of overdiagnosis and
overtreatment. Thus, although screening may not improve
mental health outcomes, it would consume scarce resources
and further burden an already financially strapped mental
health care system that struggles to provide adequate care
for children and adolescents with obvious mental health
needs. There is increasing attention to the problem of over-
diagnosis and overtreatment across areas of medicine.11 In
depression screening, overdiagnosis could result in the pre-
scription of psychotropic medications to an increased num-
ber of children, who would be exposed to the adverse effects
of these medications, even if they did not experience benefits
from screening.6
Few systematic reviews have assessed the accuracy of
screening tools for detecting major depressive disorder
(MDD) in children and adolescents, including data on
screening tool sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive
value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV). A 2009
United States Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality
(AHRQ) review,12 upon which the 2009 USPSTF guide-
lines1 were based, included 9 studies, of which 5 compared
a depression screening tool to a diagnosis of MDD based on
a validated diagnostic interview. An updated 2016 AHRQ
review,13 which formed the basis for the USPSTF’s recent
guidelines,2 identified no new eligible diagnostic accuracy
studies. The 2016 AHRQ review included only a subset of 5
studies from the 2009 review, of which 3 compared a screen-
ing tool to a validated diagnostic interview as the reference
standard for MDD.

 A 2015 systematic review and meta-analysis14 included
52 articles on 4 commonly used depression screening tools
among children and adolescents. Thirty-three studies
reported diagnostic accuracy data, but approximately half
were conducted with children or adolescents in mental health
treatment or who were referred for mental health evaluation.
Children already referred for treatment or receiving treat-
ment, however, would not be screened in actual practice,
since screening is done to identify depression among patients
who have not otherwise been identified as possibly
depressed. Screening accuracy should be evaluated among
undiagnosed and untreated patients.15 Furthermore, in the
meta-analyses conducted for each included screening tool,
the authors used sensitivity and specificity results for each
primary study based on an ‘‘optimal’’ cut-off threshold that
maximized accuracy in the particular primary study, rather
than using the same cut-off across included studies. For
example, their meta-analysis of the accuracy of the Beck
Depression Inventory (BDI) combined results from studies
using cut-offs ranging from �11 to �23. As a result, synthe-
sized accuracy values did not reflect what would be achieved
in practice if the BDI were used for screening, since in
practice, a cut-off must be chosen prior to screening.
The objective of the present systematic review was to
evaluate the accuracy of depression screening instruments
to detect MDD in children and adolescents.
Method
Detailed methods were registered in the PROSPERO pro-
spective register of systematic reviews (CRD42012003194),
and a review protocol was published.16
Search Strategy
The MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process, EMBASE, Psy-
cINFO, HaPI, and LILACS databases were searched on Sep-
tember 30, 2015, using a peer-reviewed search strategy
(Supplementary File 1). Searches included articles published
January 2006 or later because the 2009 AHRQ systematic
review on depression screening in children and adolescents,7
which included studies on the diagnostic accuracy of depres-
sion screening tools, searched through May 2006. Studies
included in the 2009 and 2016 AHRQ reviews12,13 were
evaluated for possible inclusion in the present review. Search
results were downloaded into the citation management data-
base RefWorks (RefWorks-COS, Bethesda, MD, USA), and
the software’s duplication check was used to identify cita-
tions retrieved from multiple sources.
Identification of Eligible Studies
Eligible articles were original studies in any language with
data on children and adolescents aged 6 to 18 years, con-
ducted in general medicine clinics, schools, and community
settings. Studies of college and university populations were
excluded. Studies with mixed population samples were eli-
gible if data for children or adolescents aged 6 to 18 years
were reported separately or if at least 80% of the sample
were aged 18 years or younger.
Eligible diagnostic accuracy studies had to report data
that allowed determination of the sensitivity, specificity,
PPV, and NPV of a self-report depression screening tool
compared to a current Diagnostic and Statistical Manual
of Mental Disorders (DSM) diagnosis of MDD or major
depressive episode (MDE) or International Classification
of Diseases (ICD) depressive episode, established with a
validated diagnostic interview administered within 2 weeks
of the screening tool. Study authors were contacted to deter-
mine eligibility if this interval was not specified. Studies that
reported only parent or teacher-completed depression mea-
sures were excluded. Studies that assessed broader diagnos-
tic categories, such as any depressive disorder, were
included only if they reported screening accuracy for MDD
separately or if at least 80% of cases of depression, however
defined, had a DSM diagnosis of MDD or MDE or an ICD
diagnosis of depressive episode.
Two investigators independently reviewed titles/abstracts
for eligibility, with full-text review of articles that were
identified as potentially eligible by one or both investigators.
Disagreements after full-text review were resolved by con-
sensus. All titles/abstracts and full-text articles were avail-
able in English, Spanish, German, Portuguese, or Chinese
and reviewed by investigators fluent in those languages.
Non-English articles were reviewed by a single investigator.
Evaluation of Eligible Studies
Two investigators independently extracted data into a stan-
dardized spreadsheet (Supplementary File 2). Risk of bias
was assessed based on published information with the
revised Quality Assessment for Diagnostic Accuracy Stud-
ies–2 (QUADAS-2) tool.17 QUADAS-2 incorporates assess-
ments of risk of bias across 4 core domains: patient selection,
the index test, the reference standard, and the flow and tim-
ing of assessments (see Supplementary File 3). Any discre-
pancies in data extraction and risk of bias assessment were
resolved by consensus.
Data Presentation and Synthesis
Data on the accuracy of screening tools were extracted with
95% confidence intervals18 based on ‘‘optimal’’ cut-offs
identified by primary study authors. We also determined the
lower bound of confidence intervals for each study, which is
important for clinical decision making. For example, if at
least 80% sensitivity and 90% specificity are deemed neces-
sary to consider screening, the lower bound of 95% confi-
dence intervals of accuracy estimates should be at least 80%
for sensitivity and at least 90% for specificity.19 Studies were
heterogeneous in terms of patient samples, screening tools

 and cut-offs, and criterion standards. Thus, results were not
pooled quantitatively.
Results
Selection of Eligible Studies
Of 4608 unique titles/abstracts identified from the database
search, 4444 were excluded after title/abstract review
and 147 after full-text review, leaving 17 eligible articles
(Figure 1).20-36 Three additional eligible articles37-39 pub-
lished prior to our search were identified from the 2009
AHRQ review,12 resulting in a total of 20 included articles
reporting on 17 unique studies.
Study Characteristics and Diagnostic Accuracy Results
Of the 17 included studies, 9 were conducted in school set-
tings,20-22,30-32,37-39 5 in primary care or specialty medicine
settings,23-29,36 2 in programs for adolescent mothers,33,34
and 1 as part of a population-based longitudinal study.35 Ten
studies20,22,26-29,31,33-35,37,38 restricted participants to adoles-
cents (aged 12 years and older), whereas 3 studies21,30,39
recruited study samples exclusively from high school set-
tings but did not explicitly report on the age range of
included participants. Four studies23-25,32,36 included both
children and adolescents. Sample sizes in the 17 studies
ranged from 49 to 4027 (median 290) and MDD cases from
4 to 305 (median 19). There were 2 German-language arti-
cles25,27 (see Table 1).
The 17 included studies reported diagnostic accuracy for
20 different depression screening instruments, including
subscales and alternate-length versions of standard instru-
ments. Diagnostic accuracy was based on exploratory meth-
ods, in which the same data were used to both identify an
‘‘optimal’’ screening cut-off and assess accuracy in 16 stud-
ies20-34,36-39 and not specified in 1 study35 (Table 2). Only 2
screening tools, the BDI (4 studies) and the Patient Health
Questionnaire–9 (PHQ-9; 3 studies), had diagnostic accu-
racy results reported in 3 or more studies. Of all included
studies, only 2 studies,37,38 a study from the United States
with 5 MDD cases and a study from Spain with 10 MDD
cases, identified the same optimal cut-off for a screening tool
(BDI �16).
The 4 studies of the BDI20,37-39 included 5 to 76 MDD
cases per study. ‘‘Optimal’’ screening cut-offs identified ran-
ged from �11 to �18. The width of 95% confidence inter-
vals ranged from 13% to 43% (median 30%) for sensitivity
and from 3% to 16% (median 5%) for specificity. For sensi-
tivity, only 1 study from Nigeria had a lower bound for the
95% confidence interval of at least 80%, and no studies had a
lower bound �90%. For specificity, 3 studies had lower
bounds �80% with 2 were �90%.
Three studies of the PHQ-9,28,29,31 which included 18 to
31 MDD cases, reported optimal cut-off scores that ranged
from �5 to �15. The width of the 95% confidence intervals
ranged from 24% to 39% (median 28%) for sensitivity and
from 7% to 11% (median 8%) for specificity. None of the
studies had a lower confidence interval bound of at least 80%
for sensitivity (maximum 71%), with only 1 study over 80%
for specificity.
For all other screening tools with accuracy results, num-
ber of MDD cases ranged from 4 to 305 (median 20). Esti-
mates of sensitivity were generally imprecise, with 95%
confidence intervals widths of 9% to 55% (median 33%).
For specificity, the width of 95% confidence intervals ranged
from 2% to 27% (median 11%).
Risk of Bias
As shown in Table 3, risk of bias was high for 16 of 17
studies that did not prespecify a screening test cut-off and
unclear for the remaining study.35 Only 1 study33 excluded
children and adolescents with already diagnosed or treated
depression who would not be screened in practice. Thus, for
patient selection applicability, 15 studies were rated as
unclear risk of bias, and 1 study32 was rated as high risk
since 25% of study participants were already receiving psy-
chosocial services. Risk of bias was unclear in 12 of 17
studies for methods of sample selection and unclear or high
in 5 studies for the blinding of interviewers to screening test
results. In addition, 6 studies were rated as unclear risk for
issues related to patient flow and timing, including adminis-
tration of the reference standard to only a subset of the sam-
ple, handling of missing data, and the interval between the
index test and reference standard (see Supplementary File 4

Excluded Studies and Comparison with Previous
Systematic Reviews
Of the 9 diagnostic accuracy studies included in the 2009
AHRQ systematic review,12 3 were included in the present
review.37-39 Of the other 6 studies, 3 did not administer a
validated diagnostic interview as the reference standard for
MDD, 1 did not administer a self-report screening instru-
ment as the index test, and 1 compared the screening instru-
ment to the diagnosis of any depressive disorder but did not
report the number of patients diagnosed with MDD. In
another study, the diagnostic interview was consistently
administered more than 2 weeks after the screening instru-
ment, per author report. Of the 5 diagnostic accuracy studies
included in the 2016 AHRQ systematic review,13 2 were
included in the present review.38,39 Of the other 3 studies,
1 did not administer a validated diagnostic interview as the
reference standard for MDD, 1 did not administer a self-
report screening instrument as the index test, and 1 consis-
tently administered the diagnostic interview more than 2
weeks after the screening instrument, per author report (Sup-
plementary File 5).
The 2015 Stockings et al.14 review included 33 studies
that reported on the diagnostic accuracy of depression
screening instruments, 5 of which were included in the pres-
ent review.20,34,37-39 Of these 5 studies, 337-39 were also
included in the 2009 AHRQ review and 238,39 in the 2016
AHRQ review. Sixteen studies in the Stockings et al.14
review were excluded from the present review because
samples were recruited from psychiatric settings or selected
on the basis of distress or depression (e.g., referred for
mental health evaluation). The remaining 12 studies were
excluded for other reasons, including not using a validated

Discussion
The main findings of this systematic review were that there
are relatively few studies on the accuracy of depression
screening tools to detect MDD in children and adolescents
and that existing studies have reported on a large number of
different depression screening instruments in heterogeneous
patient populations and settings. Only 2 screening tools, the
standard versions of the BDI and PHQ-9, had diagnostic
accuracy results reported in 3 or more studies.
Results on the performance of individual depression
screening tools differed substantially across studies and
require cautious interpretation. In all but 1 study, in which
the derivation of the cut-off score was not specified,35
exploratory data analysis methods were used to both set an
‘‘optimal’’ cut-off score and determine the accuracy of that
cut-off score in the same patient sample. When data-driven
methods are used to maximize diagnostic accuracy, studies
generally overestimate screening tool performance, some-
times substantially.40,41 Cut-off scores identified as ‘‘opti-
mal’’ using these data-driven methods were inconsistent
across included studies and varied too widely to provide
health care professionals with an indication as to the most
accurate cut-off score for any single screening tool. Only 2
studies included in our review37,38 identified the same ‘‘opti-
mal’’ cut-off for a screening tool (BDI �16). Furthermore,
with only 1 exception, all included studies failed to appro-
priately exclude children and adolescents already diagnosed
or treated for depression who would not be screened in clin-
ical practice to identify new cases, which can also lead to
inflated estimates of screening tool accuracy.15
Another important methodological consideration is that
sample sizes in most included studies were small for the
purpose of estimating diagnostic accuracy, with a median
of 19 MDD cases per study. Estimates of screening tool
sensitivity were imprecise, as reflected in wide 95% confi-
dence intervals. Of the 20 results reported for sensitivity,
only 1 study reported a lower confidence interval bound for
sensitivity of at least 80%. While confidence interval widths
were narrower for estimates of specificity, only 3 studies
reported a lower confidence interval bound of at least 90%.
The 2016 systematic review,13 which was done for the
USPSTF guideline,2 included only 5 studies on the accuracy
of depression screening tools, which represent a subset of the
9 diagnostic accuracy studies included in the 2009 USPSTF
review.12 Among the factors that may explain why the
AHRQ review did not identify numerous screening accuracy
studies included in the present review are the use of a single,

 combined search strategy for the review’s 6 key questions
rather than a search designed for diagnostic test accuracy
studies, the exclusion of non-English language studies and
studies conducted in developing countries, the exclusion of
studies conducted in specialty medicine settings, and the
decision to exclude otherwise eligible studies on the basis
of quality ratings.42 Quality exclusions were based on a list
of possible quality indicators but not on a validated system
for rating quality or risk of bias, such as QUADAS-2. Three
of 5 studies included in the 2016 AHRQ systematic review
did not meet eligibility criteria for the present review. Of the
2 studies that were included in the present review, both were
rated, using QUADAS-2, as having unclear risk of bias
related to patient selection and high risk related to the failure
to prespecify an index test threshold.38,39
The 2016 USPSTF guidelines suggest the use of the
Patient Health Questionnaire for Adolescents (PHQ-A) and
the Beck Depression Inventory–Primary Care version (BDI-
PC) as screening tools for adolescents in primary care set-
tings.2 The PHQ-A is similar to the PHQ-9 for adults with
minor adaptations in wording.43 The BDI-PC is a 7-item
depression screening tool, derived from the cognitive items
of the BDI-II.44 This recommendation was based on only 1
study of the PHQ-A43 and no evidence on the accuracy of the
BDI-PC in children or adolescents.13 The PHQ-A study43
was excluded from the present review because it did not
compare the PHQ-A to a validated diagnostic interview to
determine MDD status.
The USPSTF recommends routine depression screening
for adolescents in primary care settings when integrated
depression care systems are in place.2 This recommendation
was made, even though no trials among children or adult
patients have found that patients who are screened have
better outcomes than patients who are not screened when
both groups have access to similar depression treatments.7,45
Screening is sometimes implemented even without direct
evidence of effectiveness. TeenScreen, an American pro-
gram based at Columbia University, urged implementation
of universal depression screening for adolescents and was
reportedly active at over 2800 sites in the United States and
internationally before the project’s unexplained closure in
2012.46 In Canada, several provincial governments have
called for widespread depression screening in school settings
and medical practices.47-49 In the absence of trials, the find-
ings of the present review suggest important reasons why
depression screening may be less effective than anticipated
and could result in more harm than benefit. If the evidence
base for depression screening tools overestimates their accu-
racy, the use of these questionnaires in screening programs
would likely lead to high false-positive rates, unnecessary
labeling, overtreatment in some cases, and the consumption
of scarce mental health resources that could otherwise be
used to provide better care for children and adolescents with
undertreated mental health problems.6
A possible limitation of the systematic review is that we
did not search for unpublished studies. Given the findings of
the systematic review, it is unlikely that this would have
changed the findings or conclusions. Another possible lim-
itation is that we did not conduct a de novo search for studies
prior to 2006 but rather used studies included in a previously
published systematic review. It is possible that there could
have been eligible early studies that were not identified,
although the existence of multiple systematic reviews on this
topic suggests that this is unlikely. Finally, although vali-
dated diagnostic interviews are considered the gold standard
for establishing psychiatric diagnoses, there is not robust
evidence establishing their degree of accuracy or
replicability.
Conclusions
In summary, this systematic review found that there is
insufficient evidence of the ability of depression screening
instruments to accurately detect MDD in children and ado-
lescents. Few studies have examined the accuracy of the
same screening tools in comparable settings and popula-
tions, and there is inadequate evidence to recommend any
single cut-off score for any of the instruments evaluated in
the included studies. Significant methodological concerns,
including small sample sizes, the use of data-driven
exploratory methods to identify ‘‘optimal’’ cut-off scores,
and the failure to exclude patients already diagnosed or
treated for depression, raise concerns that existing studies
may overestimate screening tool accuracy. Well-conducted
studies with large sample sizes that present results across
the range of possible cut-offs and follow guidance from
key sources, including the Cochrane Handbook for Diag-
nostic Test Accuracy Meta-Analyses50 and the STARD
statement,51 are needed. The absence of any evidence from
clinical trials that depression screening would improve
mental health outcomes, along with the results from this
systematic review, suggests that screening children and
adolescents could lead to more harm than benefit and
would consume scarce mental health resources that could
otherwise be used to provide treatment for underserved
youth with mental disorders.
