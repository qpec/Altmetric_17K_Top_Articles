Abstract
Importance—Cancer treatments are associated with subsequent neoplasms in childhood cancer 
survivors. It is unknown whether temporal changes in therapy are associated with changes in 
subsequent neoplasm risk.
Objective—Quantify the association between temporal treatment dosing changes and subsequent 
neoplasm risk.
Design, Setting, Participants—Retrospective, multicenter cohort of five-year cancer survivors 
diagnosed before age 21 years from pediatric tertiary hospitals in the United States and Canada 
between 1970-1999, with follow-up through December 2015.
Exposures—Radiation and chemotherapy dose changes over time.
Main Outcomes and Measures—Subsequent neoplasm 15-year cumulative incidence, 
cumulative burden, and standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) for subsequent malignancies were 
compared by treatment decade. Multivariable models assessed relative rates (RRs) of subsequent 
neoplasms by 5-year increments, adjusting for demographic and clinical characteristics. Mediation

 analyses assessed whether changes in subsequent neoplasm rates over time were mediated by 
treatment variable modifications.
Results—Among 23,603 childhood cancer survivors (mean age at diagnosis, 7.7 years; 46% 
female) the most common initial diagnoses were acute lymphoblastic leukemia, Hodgkin 
lymphoma and astrocytoma. During a mean follow up of 20.5 years (374,638 person-years at risk), 
1,639 survivors experienced 3,115 subsequent neoplasms, including 1,026 malignancies, 233 
benign meningiomas, and 1,856 non-melanoma skin cancers. The most common subsequent 
malignancies were breast and thyroid cancers. Individuals receiving radiation decreased (1970s, 
77% vs. 1990s, 33%), as did median dose (1970s, 30 Gy [IQR 24-44] vs. 1990s, 26 Gy [IQR 
18-45]). Fifteen-year cumulative incidence of subsequent malignancies decreased by decade of 
diagnosis (1990s: 1.3%, 95%CI 1.1-1.5, 1980s: 1.7%, 95%CI 1.5-2.0, 1970s: 2.1%, 95%CI 
1.7-2.4). Reference absolute rates per 1,000 person-years for subsequent malignancies, 
meningiomas and non-melanoma skin cancers were 1.12 (95%CI 0.84-1.57), 0.16 (95%CI 
0.06-0.41), and 1.71 (95%CI 0.88-3.33), respectively, for survivors with reference characteristics 
(no chemotherapy, splenectomy or radiation therapy, male, attained age of 28). SIRs declined for 
subsequent malignancies over treatment decades, with advancing attained age. Relative rates 
declined with each 5-year increment for subsequent malignancies (RR=0.87, 95%CI 0.82-0.93, 
p<0.001), meningiomas (RR=0.85, 95%CI 0.75-0.97, p=0.034), and non-melanoma skin cancers 
(RR=0.75, 95%CI 0.67-0.84, p<0.001). Radiation dose changes were associated with reduced risk 
for subsequent malignancies, meningiomas, and non-melanoma skin cancers.
Conclusions and Relevance—Among childhood cancer survivors, the risk of subsequent 
malignancies at 15 years after initial cancer diagnosis remained increased for those diagnosed in 
the 1990s, although the risk was lower compared with those diagnosed in the 1970s. This lower 
risk was associated with reduction in therapeutic radiation dose.
Introduction
As cure rates for childhood cancers have improved, there has been an increasing awareness 
of the late health consequences of childhood cancer therapies. One outcome associated with 
significant morbidity and mortality for these survivors is the development of subsequent 
neoplasms, unique from recurrence of the original childhood malignancy 1. Survivors with a 
subsequent neoplasm are more likely to report adverse general and mental health 
outcomes 2, and have increased hospitalization rates 3 compared to survivors without a 
subsequent neoplasm. Subsequent malignant neoplasms are the most common non-relapse 
cause of late mortality, accounting for approximately half of all non-relapse deaths among 
five-year survivors 1,4.
The Childhood Cancer Survivor Study (CCSS) 5 and other cohorts of childhood cancer 
survivors 6 have reported extensively on the incidence of and risk factors for subsequent 
neoplasms 7-9. Therapeutic radiation has been strongly associated with development of 
subsequent neoplasms 10; however, dose-response relationships have also been identified for 
specific chemotherapeutic agents, including alkylating agents and epipodophyllotoxins 11-13. 
With this knowledge, childhood cancer treatment has been modified over time with the hope 
of reducing subsequent neoplasm risk, while maintaining or improving 5-year survival 14,15.

 The CCSS cohort was recently expanded to include survivors diagnosed and treated across 
three decades (1970-1999). The aim of the present analysis was to assess temporal changes 
in subsequent neoplasms among individuals diagnosed during this period. We hypothesized 
that historical modifications in radiotherapy and chemotherapy dosing would be associated 
with changes in the incidence of subsequent neoplasms among five-year childhood cancer 
survivors, based on their decade of diagnosis, throughout the course of follow-up.
Materials and Methods
CCSS Cohort
The CCSS is a retrospective cohort study with longitudinal follow-up of 5-year survivors of 
childhood cancer diagnosed at one of 27 participating institutions in the United States or 
Canada between January 1, 1970 and December 31, 1999. Participants were <21 years of 
age at initial diagnosis of leukemia, Hodgkin lymphoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, central 
nervous system cancer, Wilms tumor, neuroblastoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, or bone cancer. 
Human subjects committee approval was granted at participating institutions prior to 
recruitment. Participants, or parents of children <18 years of age, provided informed 
consent. Minor participants were re-consented once they reached 18 years. Participants 
completed a baseline and up to four follow-up questionnaires. Race/ethnicity data was 
obtained through self-report. Participants were asked to select: White, Black, American 
Indian or Alaska Native, Asian or Pacific Islander, or Other, with the option to write in their 
race. Hispanic ethnicity was ascertained through a yes/no question. Race and ethnicity were 
included in the analysis for descriptive purposes. The final date of follow up was December 
31, 2015. Study design and methods have been previously described 5,16.
Subsequent Neoplasm Ascertainment and Therapeutic Agents
Subsequent neoplasms were identified via self- or next-of-kin proxy-report or death 
certificate and confirmed by pathology report, or when unavailable, death certificate and/or 
medical records. Only subsequent neoplasms occurring ≥5 years following initial cancer 
diagnosis were evaluated. Subsequent neoplasms were classified into three mutually 
exclusive groups, based on historical experience with frequently occurring neoplasm sub-
types: 1) subsequent malignant neoplasms, which include invasive neoplasms classified as 
International Classification of Disease for Oncology (ICD-O, 3rd version), behavior code of 
3 17, excluding non-melanoma skin cancers; 2) benign meningiomas; and 3) non-melanoma 
skin cancers (including ICD-O morphology codes 8070, 8071, 8081, 8090 and 8094). 
Cancer therapies, including surgery, chemotherapy and radiation, were ascertained through 
medical record abstraction, as previously described 16,18. Cumulative alkylating agent dose 
was reported as a cyclophosphamide equivalent dose 19. Maximum radiation treatment dose 
was calculated for eight body regions (brain, other head, neck, chest, abdomen, pelvis, arm 
and leg) for each patient. For this analysis, we considered any radiation treatment (yes/no) 
for cumulative incidence and cumulative burden estimates, and maximum doses for 
multivariable models.

 Statistical Methods
Cohort follow-up started at five years from diagnosis and ended upon death or date of last 
completed questionnaire. Cumulative burden, assessed using the mean cumulative 
count, 20,21 and cumulative incidence were estimated using time from initial diagnosis as the 
time scale, treating death as a competing risk event. Cumulative burden is an estimate of the 
average number of subsequent neoplasms per 100 survivors by a given time, in the presence 
of competing risk events, and accounts for multiple events in individuals, whereas 
cumulative incidence only accounts for the first event. Cumulative incidence and cumulative 
burden at 15 years from diagnosis were compared across treatment decades using 
permutation tests.
For subsequent malignant neoplasms, standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) (ratio of the 
observed to expected number of events) and absolute excess risk per 1,000 person years 
were calculated using age-sex-calendar-year-specific U.S. cancer incidence rates from the 
Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program to determine expected numbers of 
events 22. Because comparison by treatment era is subject to confounding by attained age, 
SIRs were calculated stratifying on 10-year age intervals. Multivariable piecewise-
exponential models were used to assess the incidence rate of subsequent neoplasm types, in 
association with demographic variables and childhood cancer diagnosis, adjusting for 
attained age, treatment doses and 5-year treatment eras. Reference absolute rates per 1,000 
person-years were calculated using the fitted model for survivors with reference 
characteristics (no chemotherapy, splenectomy or radiation therapy, male, attained age of 
28). Multiple subsequent neoplasm occurrences within individual survivors were included 
and accounted for in the models by modifications of the models using generalized estimating 
equations. Adjusted relative rates and 95% confidence intervals were estimated. In addition, 
using mediation analysis methods previously described 4,23-25, changes in subsequent 
neoplasm rates in 5-year treatment era increments were estimated with and without 
adjustment for treatment variables in the same model, to assess whether changes in 
subsequent neoplasm rates over time were mediated by treatment modifications. 
Specifically, as shown in the causal diagram that depicts the assumptions of the mediation 
analysis (eFigure 1), a multivariable piecewise-exponential model was fit to assess the 
association of treatment era with subsequent neoplasm rates, adjusting for attained age, sex, 
age at initial cancer diagnosis, and treatment variables (the full model), followed by removal 
of treatment variables from the model. Attenuation and the statistical significance of the 
treatment era regression coefficient, the parameter representing the adjusted log rate ratio of 
subsequent neoplasms by 5-year treatment increments, by the inclusion of treatment 
variables in the model, constitute the key step of establishing the mediator role of treatment 
variables, along with the associations of treatment era and treatment variables and those of 
treatment variables and subsequent neoplasm rates in the full model. Nonparametric 
bootstrap was used to test statistical significance of the changes in the regression coefficient 
associated with the 5-year treatment era with and without adjustment for treatment variables. 
For analyses examining treatment doses, only individuals with available treatment data were 
included. All tests were two-sided with p<0.05 considered statistically significant. SAS 
(version 9.4) was used for all statistical analyses including the mediation analysis and R 
(version 3.2.4) was used for statistical graphics.

Cohort Characteristics
Among the 23,603 eligible, consented survivors (Figure 1), 46% were female, the mean age 
at primary diagnosis was 7.7 years, and the most common initial diagnoses were acute 
lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), Hodgkin lymphoma and astrocytoma. Mean follow-up 
ranged from 15.7 years for those diagnosed in the 1990s to 27.6 years for survivors 
diagnosed in the 1970s. Over the course of 374,638 person-years at risk, 1,639 survivors 
experienced 3,115 subsequent neoplasms including 1,026 subsequent malignancies, 233 
benign meningiomas, and 1,856 non-melanoma skin cancers (Table 1). The distribution of 
subsequent neoplasms by primary cancer diagnosis is shown in eTable 1 and the distribution 
of observed and expected subsequent malignancies, by decade of initial cancer diagnosis, is 
provided in eTable 2. The most frequently observed subsequent malignancies were breast 
and thyroid cancer.
Complete treatment data were available for 83% of the cohort. Between 1970-1999 there 
were substantial changes in therapies. Radiation therapy decreased from 77% of survivors 
treated in the 1970s, to 54% in the 1980s and 33% in the 1990s. Median radiation treatment 
dose decreased from 30 Gy (interquartile range [IQR] 24-44) in the 1970s to 26 Gy (IQR 
18-52) in the 1990s. Although the proportion of children treated with alkylating agents and 
anthracyclines increased over time, median doses decreased. The proportion of children 
treated with epipodophyllotoxins and platinum agents also increased over the three decades; 
however, whereas the median cumulative dose of platinum increased with each treatment 
decade, the median cumulative dose of epipodophyllotoxins increased substantially in the 
1980s and then decreased in the 1990s (Table 1).
Cumulative Incidence and Cumulative Burden of Subsequent Neoplasms
At 15 years from initial diagnosis, the cumulative incidence of subsequent neoplasms was 
2.9% (95% CI 2.5-3.3) among individuals diagnosed in the 1970s, 2.4% (95% CI 2.1-2.7) in 
those diagnosed in the 1980s, and 1.5% (95% CI 1.3-1.8) in survivors from the 1990s (1970s 
vs. 1980s p=0.024; 1970s vs. 1990s p<0.001; 1980s vs. 1990s p<0.001) (Figure 2A). The 
cumulative burden of subsequent neoplasms per 100 survivors was 3.6, 2.8 and 1.7 at 15 
years in those diagnosed in the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s (Figure 2B), respectively (1970s vs. 
1980s p=0.016; 1970s vs. 1990s p<0.001; 1980s vs. 1990s p=0.001). After 20 years from 
diagnosis, among survivors from the 1970s and 1980s, the steep increase in cumulative 
burden was secondary to recurrent non-melanoma skin cancer events.
A significantly lower 15-year cumulative incidence of subsequent malignancies was 
observed in those diagnosed in the 1990s (1.3%, 95% CI 1.1-1.5) compared to the 1980s 
(1.7%, 95% CI 1.5-2.0, p=0.02) and to the 1970s (2.1%, 95% CI 1.7-2.4, p<0.001) (Figure 
2A, eTable 3). A similar decline was seen for non-melanoma skin cancers but not for 
meningiomas. When assessing incidence by primary cancer diagnosis, declines between 
decades were seen for Hodgkin lymphoma and Wilms tumor, but only survivors of Hodgkin 
lymphoma demonstrated a statistically significant decrease in 15-year cumulative incidence 
of subsequent neoplasms across decades (eFigure 2). Among the most common subsequent

 malignancies, only soft tissue sarcomas (1970s 0.26%, 95% CI 0.13-0.38 vs. 1990s 0.13%, 
95% CI 0.06-0.21, p=0.032) and breast cancers (1970s 0.27%, 95% CI 0.14-0.40 vs. 1990s 
0.08% 95% CI 0.02-0.14, p=0.003) had significant decreases in 15-year cumulative 
incidence from 1970s to 1990s (eFigure 3).
Survivors treated with radiation experienced a higher cumulative incidence of all types of 
subsequent neoplasms, for all treatment decades (eFigure 4). Cumulative burden for non-
melanoma skin cancers compared to cumulative incidence, showed a more pronounced 
difference based on receipt of radiation therapy, exemplifying the number of radiation-
exposed survivors with multiple events. Among irradiated survivors, a significant decrease in 
the 15-year cumulative incidence of non-melanoma skin cancers was observed for the most 
recent treatment decade (1970s 1.0%, 95% CI 0.7-1.3; 1980s 0.9%, 95% CI 0.6-1.1; 1990s 
0.2%, 95% CI 0.1-0.4; 1970s vs. 1980s, p=0.27; 1970s vs 1990s, p<0.001; 1980s vs. 1990s 
p<0.001).
Risk of Subsequent Malignant Neoplasms
Reference absolute rates per 1,000 person-years was 4.21 (95% CI 3.05-5.81) for subsequent 
neoplasms, 1.12 (95% CI 0.84-1.57) for subsequent malignancies, 0.16 (95% CI 0.06-0.41) 
for meningiomas, and 1.71 (95% CI 0.88-3.33) for non-melanoma skin cancers. Lower SIRs 
were observed by decade of diagnosis for survivors whose attained age was 20-29 years 
(1970s 5.7, 95% CI 4.7-6.7; 1980s 4.8, 95% CI 4.0-5.6; 1990s 3.6, 95% CI 2.7-4.6; 
p=0.004) and 30-39 years (1970s 5.6, 95% CI 4.8-6.4; 1980s 4.9, 95% CI 4.1-6.0; 1990s 3.1, 
95% CI 1.8-5.0; p=0.03) (Figure 3, eTable 4). Decreases in SIRs across treatment decades 
within specific subsequent malignancy types were not observed (eFigure 5). Among 
survivors of Hodgkin lymphoma with attained age ≥20 years, SIRs for subsequent 
malignancies decreased over time (20-29 years, 1970s 10.7, 95% CI 7.7-14.4; 1980s 6.8, 
95% CI 4.4-10.0; 1990s 5.5, 95% CI 3.2-9.0; p=0.016, and 30-39 years, 1970s 10.2, 95% CI 
8.2-12.5; 1980s 8.4, 95% CI 6.3-11.0; 1990s 5.2, 95% CI 2.4-9.8; p=0.038) (eTable 5).
Risk Factors for Subsequent Neoplasms
Multivariable analysis demonstrated that females experienced increased rates of subsequent 
malignant neoplasms (RR 1.7, 95% CI 1.5-2.0, p<0.001) and meningiomas (RR 1.4, 95% CI 
1.0-2.0, p=0.05) compared to males. Treatment with high doses of alkylating agents and 
platinum agents were also associated with increased rates of subsequent malignancies and 
therapeutic radiation at all dose increments was associated with increased rates of 
subsequent malignant neoplasms, meningiomas, and non-melanoma skin cancers (Table 2, 
crude data reported in eTable 6).
After adjusting for sex, age at diagnosis, and attained age, relative rates declined for every 5-
year increment of treatment era for subsequent neoplasms (RR=0.81, 95% CI 0.76-0.86, 
p<0.001), subsequent malignant neoplasms (RR=0.87, 95% CI 0.82-0.93, p<0.001), 
meningiomas (RR=0.85, 95% CI 0.75-0.97, p=0.03), and non-melanoma skin cancers 
(RR=0.75, 95% CI 0.67-0.84, p<0.001; Table 3). Inclusion of all treatment variables in the 
model attenuated statistically significantly the treatment era-associated decline of 
subsequent neoplasms (p<0.001), subsequent malignant neoplasms (p<0.001), meningioma

 (p=0.027) and non-melanoma skin cancer (p<0.001) rates. Further mediation analyses were 
conducted by modifying the adjustment from all treatment variables to specific components 
of treatment variables (i.e., maximum radiation dose and all other treatments, including 
chemotherapy drug doses and splenectomy). These analyses revealed that radiation therapy 
dose changes were the chief contributor to the era-associated decline of subsequent 
neoplasm rates and that radiation therapy dose changes were the only component of the 
treatment variables significantly associated with the decline of subsequent neoplasm rates 
over time (Table 3).
Discussion
Survival following childhood cancer has improved substantially over the last five decades. 
As the number of survivors has increased, so has the focus on late outcomes of cancer 
therapy. Cohort studies, including the CCSS, devoted to understanding the late health 
consequences of childhood cancer therapies 6 have previously documented the effect of 
subsequent neoplasms and quantified risk associated with specific therapies, particularly 
therapeutic radiation 7,26-28. Accordingly, efforts have been directed toward eliminating the 
use of radiation therapy when possible, or decreasing the volume and/or dose 14,15. An 
example of this is the near elimination of cranial radiation among children newly diagnosed 
with ALL 29. As treatment with radiation has decreased, some chemotherapy regimens have 
intensified 14. This evolution in delivered therapies has reduced late mortality among 
survivors 4; however, the association with specific outcomes, including subsequent 
neoplasms, has not been investigated. The current analysis, including more than 23,000 
survivors of childhood cancer treated over three decades, demonstrated that the cumulative 
incidence rates of subsequent neoplasms, subsequent malignant neoplasms, meningiomas 
and non-melanoma skin cancers were lower among survivors treated in more recent 
treatment eras and that modifications of primary cancer therapy were associated with these 
declines.
Hodgkin lymphoma survivors are at particularly high-risk for subsequent malignancies 30-33. 
Our findings demonstrated a decreased 15-year cumulative incidence of subsequent 
neoplasms for Hodgkin lymphoma survivors treated in the 1990s compared to earlier 
decades, with cumulative incidence of subsequent malignant neoplasms at 15 years 
significantly lower in the 1990s compared to the 1970s. In contrast, a recent report of Dutch 
long-term survivors of Hodgkin lymphoma demonstrated the cumulative incidence of second 
cancers did not decrease across treatment decades 34. Within our study the SIR for 
subsequent malignant neoplasms decreased over time among survivors of Hodgkin 
lymphoma with attained age ≥20 years. Intensified alkylator dosing has been used in 
Hodgkin lymphoma since the 1980s to compensate for decreasing therapeutic radiation 14. 
At high cumulative doses, alkylating agents are associated with increased rates of 
subsequent malignant neoplasms, which may have attenuated the expected decline in 
subsequent malignancies among Hodgkin lymphoma survivors, particularly among the 
Dutch cohort where a decrease in incidence was not observed.
Temporal treatment modifications have also been made using improved risk stratification of 
children with ALL and Wilms tumor 14,15, among others, which have led to decreased late

 mortality from subsequent malignant neoplasms among survivors 4. In ALL, cranial 
irradiation has been replaced with intensive intrathecal therapy in nearly all patients. 
Meningiomas are among the most frequently observed subsequent neoplasms in survivors of 
ALL, and, given the latency of >20 years to development of meningiomas 7, it is likely that 
the full effect of omitting cranial irradiation among more recently treated survivors has not 
yet been observed. Temporal changes in Wilms tumor therapy include reduction in the dose 
and even elimination of therapeutic radiation in low risk populations, which has likely 
contributed to the decreased cumulative incidence of subsequent malignant neoplasms in the 
1990s compared to the 1970s.
These data further document the increased cumulative incidence, cumulative burden and 
elevated risk for subsequent malignant neoplasms, meningiomas and non-melanoma skin 
cancers in survivors treated with radiation therapy 7. Despite reduced use of therapeutic 
radiation, radiation continues to be an important component of treatment for many children. 
As the use of radiation therapy decreases it is possible that other associations may emerge. 
Specifically, to maintain and improve cure rates, chemotherapy dosing and/or the proportion 
of patients receiving various agents have been increasing. Although there has been a 
decrease in the median cumulative doses of alkylating agents and anthracyclines, the 
proportion of survivors receiving these agents increased. For epipodophyllotoxins and 
platinum agents, increased median cumulative doses were given in the 1990s compared to 
the 1970s and the proportion of survivors treated with these agents increased over time. We 
observed an increased rate of subsequent malignant neoplasms with higher cumulative doses 
of alkylating agents and platinum agents. These associations may become more prominent 
as therapeutic radiation use continues to decline. Additionally, the role of genetic 
susceptibility in the development of subsequent neoplasms may become more evident and 
interactions between host genetics and chemotherapy doses may emerge as well.
This study represents, to our knowledge, the first comprehensive report of subsequent 
neoplasms from the CCSS since the expansion of the cohort to include survivors initially 
diagnosed through 1970-1999. Both the British Childhood Cancer Survivor Study35 and a 
cohort of childhood cancer survivors from Nordic cancer registries 36 have reported on 
subsequent neoplasms from patients diagnosed over extended periods of time (British 
1940-1991, Nordic 1943-2005); however, this is the first study, to our knowledge, to report 
changes in subsequent neoplasm incidence and SIRs as a function of treatment era and 
treatment variables. The mediation analysis 23-25 demonstrated that, in conjunction with (a) 
reduction in treatment doses and decreased splenectomy frequency across treatment eras 
(Table 1) and (b) statistically significant associations of treatment variables with subsequent 
neoplasm rates when controlling for era of treatment and treatment variables (Table 2), that 
the decline of subsequent neoplasm rates was mediated by treatment variable changes over 
time. In this analysis the age-specific SIRs and overall cumulative incidence of subsequent 
malignant neoplasms at 15 years consistently decreased for more recent treatment eras. As 
observed in previous CCSS reports on subsequent neoplasms 37, SIRs are greatest at 
younger attained ages because they measure observed counts relative to expected counts in 
the age- and sex-matched general population. Although significant decreases were observed 
from the 1970s to 1990s in 15-year cumulative incidence of breast cancer, soft tissue 
sarcoma and non-melanoma skin cancer, significant decreases were not observed for

 subsequent leukemia, central nervous system or thyroid malignancies (eFigure 3, eFigure 4). 
Furthermore, significant decreases in SIRs for specific subsequent malignancies, including 
breast cancer, soft tissue sarcoma, leukemia, central nervous system and thyroid 
malignancies were not observed when stratified by decade of diagnosis and attained age 
(eFigure 5). The lack of significant changes in individual malignancies is in contrast to the 
overall decrease in subsequent malignancies with more recent treatment eras and the 
decrease in use of therapeutic radiation; however, the observed numbers of subsequent 
malignancies are small for each subgroup and the confidence intervals are wide, indicating 
possible insufficient power to detect significant differences and also suggesting additional 
mechanisms contributing to subsequent malignancy risk. Ongoing follow-up of survivors 
from the latest treatment decade is needed to determine changes in risk over time, 
particularly given the long latency from primary diagnosis to many subsequent malignant 
neoplasms.
This study has important limitations. Although the CCSS is a large, well-characterized 
cohort, it is not completely representative of the childhood cancer survivor population and 
there is potential for selection bias given that 33% of eligible survivors were not included in 
this analysis. Selected primary diagnoses, including retinoblastoma, germ cell tumor, and 
hepatoblastoma were not included. Children with heritable retinoblastoma are at significant 
risk of subsequent neoplasms and their exclusion may have resulted in underestimation of 
subsequent malignancy risk. Subsequent neoplasms were initially self-reported, which may 
have led to underreporting of neoplasms, particularly those occurring in the more distant 
past. Additionally, the design of the CCSS cohort to include only five-year survivors a-priori 
excludes consideration of cancers occurring prior to five years. Also, therapies for 
subsequent neoplasms are not completely ascertained, which limits further exploration of the 
role of treatments among survivors who develop multiple subsequent neoplasms. In addition, 
interpretation of results should be made within the context of the multiple statistical tests 
performed to address the hypotheses of interest.
Conclusions
Among childhood cancer survivors, the risk of subsequent malignancies at 15 years after 
initial cancer diagnosis remained increased for those diagnosed in the 1990s, although the 
risk was lower compared with those diagnosed in the 1970s. This lower risk was associated 
with reduction in therapeutic radiation dose.

 Key Points
Question
Are treatment-era related changes in chemotherapy or radiation therapy doses associated 
with changes in the risk of subsequent neoplasms over time among survivors of 
childhood cancer?
Findings
In this longitudinal cohort study of 23,603 survivors of childhood cancer, reductions in 
therapeutic radiation doses over time were associated with reduced rates of subsequent 
neoplasms, including subsequent malignancies, non-melanoma skin cancers and benign 
meningiomas.
Meaning
Ongoing efforts to reduce long-term therapeutic toxicity were associated with decreasing 
subsequent neoplasms among five-year survivors of childhood cancer.

 Figure 1. Cohort composition diagram for eligible and enrolled childhood cancer survivors
aFrom 1970-1986 all types of soft tissue sarcomas (as initial childhood cancer diagnosis) 
were included in the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study cohort. However, for the period 
1987-1999 rhabdomyosarcoma was the only type of soft tissue sarcoma included; thus, in 
order to have a homogeneous population across decades, we excluded non-
rhabdomyosarcoma diagnoses.

Black line, 1970-79; blue line, 1980-89; green line, 1990-99. Vertical bars represent 95% 
confidence intervals. Analyses were weighted to account for undersampling of acute 
lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) survivors (1987-1999), with a weight of 1.21 for ALL age 0 
or 11-20 years at diagnosis, and a weight of 3.63 for those aged 1-10 years.
The number of individuals from each decade of diagnosis contributing data for each attained 
age are as follows: 1970s, 10-19 years 5,072; 20-29 years 5,810; 30-39 years 4,809; 1980s, 
10-19 years 7,932; 20-29 years 8,283; 30-39 years 3,901; 1990s, 10-19 years 6,622; 20-29

aAnalyses, including reported percentages and means/medians, were weighted to account for undersampling of acute lymphoblastic leukemia 
(ALL) survivors (1987-1999), with a weight of 1.21 for ALL age 0 or 11-20 years at diagnosis, and a weight of 3.63 for those aged 1-10 years.
b577 had data from one or two of the treatments missing. Among the 577, 169 received radiation therapy, 185 received surgery, and 360 received 
chemotherapy.
cRates are based on the entire eligible cohort, for which NDI has mortality information.
