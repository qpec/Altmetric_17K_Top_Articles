Abstract
Background: We have little understanding of how vapers use e-cigarettes beyond cessation. E-cigarettes may have a
role to play in reducing the health-related harms of tobacco smoking, through not only assisting smoking cessation
attempts but also supporting long-term abstinence from smoking. However, there are fears that vaping may lead to
the ‘renormalisation’ of smoking type behaviours. This study aimed to explore patterns of use and reported experiences
of vapers quitting smoking using an e-cigarette in relation to long-term smoking status (abstinence or relapse).
Methods: A purposive sample of 40 UK vapers was matched to a sampling frame of demographic characteristics from a
representative sample of UK quitters. Following full informed consent, semi-structured qualitative interviews were
conducted. Data were thematically analysed by two members of the research team. Final thematic analysis was verified
and agreed by consensus.
Results: The sample self-reported long histories of tobacco use and multiple previous quit attempts which had eventually
resulted in relapse back to smoking, although a small but important group had never before attempted to quit. Initiating
e-cigarette use was experienced as a revelation for some, who were quickly able to fully switch to using e-cigarettes as an
alternative to tobacco smoking. For others, periods of dual use or smoking relapse combined with attempts at vaping
that were not initially satisfactory. Many of these chose a cheaper ‘cig-a-like’ device which they found to be inadequate.
Experimentation with different devices and different setups, over time, resulted in some ‘sliding’ rather than switching to
vaping. This involved periods of ‘dual use’. Some settled on patterns of vaping as a direct substitute of previous tobacco
smoking, whereas others reported ‘grazing’ patterns of vaping throughout the day that were perceived to support
tobacco smoking abstinence.
Conclusions: Our data demonstrates that e-cigarettes may be a unique harm reduction innovation for smoking relapse
prevention. E-cigarettes meet the needs of some ex-smokers by substituting physical, psychological, social, cultural and
identity-related aspects of tobacco addiction. Some vapers reported that they found vaping pleasurable and
enjoyable—being more than a substitute but actually preferred, over time, to tobacco smoking. This clearly
suggests that vaping is a viable long-term substitute for smoking, with substantial implications for tobacco
harm reduction.

 Background
E-cigarettes may have a role to play in reducing the
health-related harms of tobacco smoking through not only
assisting smoking cessation attempts but, perhaps more
importantly, supporting long-term abstinence from to-
bacco smoking. A review of the latest available evidence
suggests that e-cigarettes are at least 95% less harmful to
health than tobacco smoking [1]. E-cigarettes have be-
come the most popular aid to quitting smoking in the UK
[1]. This is perhaps particularly so for the general popula-
tion not wishing to seek formal support for smoking ces-
sation from a health professional. Indeed, it is for this
population of non-help seekers that the harm reduction
role of e-cigarettes may be most clearly realised. There is
now substantial support for vaping as a harm reduction
approach and an alternative to tobacco smoking from UK
Medical [2] and public health bodies [1, 3].
However, the use of e-cigarettes for smoking cessation,
and particularly longer-term use, remains controversial.
The UK takes a relatively permissive stance, but vaping
is still banned in many countries [4]. The long-term
health effects of vaping are unknown and may not be
clearly recognised for many years, since most e-cigarette
users are ex-smokers, and thus, disaggregating the health
impact of vaping from previous smoking is difficult. Al-
though studies are beginning to show that the health im-
pact of vaping may be comparable to NRT use [4], there
are concerns from some public health perspectives that
vaping may ‘renormalise’ ‘smoking-like’ behaviours. This
may actually encourage more people to smoke or those
who have quit to potentially relapse [5]. Despite vaping
being recognised as a less harmful method of using nico-
tine than tobacco smoking, addiction to nicotine is
maintained, and this can be a cause for concern [6].
E-cigarettes are a consumer product, which possibly has
created some unrest amongst the medical community,
who may perceive medicalised forms of nicotine (NRT)
as superior or safer harm reduction approaches to the
continued use of nicotine [7]. The concept of addiction
itself is morally laden, with many health professionals,
and indeed consumers, having a view that the avoidance
of any addiction at all is preferable [7]. Thus, the
longer-term use of e-cigarettes in relation to tobacco
smoking status is a controversial area, due to the inher-
ent duality of e-cigarettes as both offering potential for
long-term smoking abstinence yet supporting a contin-
ued addiction to nicotine [8].
Prior to the widespread use of e-cigarettes, longitudinal
studies exploring smoking cessation attempts in relation
to long-term outcomes suggested that although many
smokers managed to initially quit, over time, relapse to to-
bacco smoking was common [9]. Research suggests a
range of psychosocial factors at play in contributing to re-
lapse, including physical addiction (craving), behavioural
cues to smoke (e.g. for the ‘habit’), social and environmen-
tal cues to smoke (being with other smokers, associating
smoking as social relaxation) [10–17] and concepts that
cut across psychological and social domains, such as re-
lapse as signifying a regaining of the lost identity that was
available as a smoker [18, 19]. Initial lapse to tobacco
smoking has in the past been shown to be highly predict-
ive of full relapse [20]. However, emergent qualitative evi-
dence suggests that this association may potentially be less
strong in the context of e-cigarette use [21]. We have little
understanding of how vapers use e-cigarettes beyond ces-
sation to specifically avoid long-term smoking relapse.
There is also concern that vapers may continue to ‘dual
use’ e-cigarettes alongside continued tobacco smoking.
This study sought to purposefully recruit for in-depth in-
terviews people in the general population (not accessing
specialist smoking cessation services) who attempted to
quit smoking using an e-cigarette, specifically exploring
how reported patterns and trajectories of use over time
may or may not support long-term smoking abstinence.
Methods
We sought to answer the research questions: ‘what is the
experience of e-cigarette use over time?’ and ‘what are
vapers’ reported experiences of either tobacco smoking
abstinence or relapse?’ A qualitative approach was par-
ticularly suitable in this context, where existing theory is
outdated in the context of a fast-moving consumer mar-
ket establishing e-cigarettes as integral to the majority of
smoking quit attempts.
For recruitment, we defined smoking relapse as ‘a suc-
cessful smoking quit attempt of at least 48 h, followed by
a relapse (more than five instances of reported lapse) to
tobacco smoking’. This was an inclusive definition in
order to capture both early and late relapsers, whilst ex-
cluding dual users and triallers (those who use e-cigarettes
alongside tobacco smoking without making a serious quit
attempt). This gives us a practical and clear definition by
which to differentiate those e-cigarette users who we can
define as ‘relapsed to smoking’ as compared to those ‘ab-
stinent from smoking’.
The study comprised qualitative interviews using pur-
posive sampling. Participants were initially recruited using
established personal networks of the research team, via
self-referral through advertising in local, national and so-
cial media, and snowballing to seek referrals from inter-
viewees. From eligible referrals, a purposive sample of 40
UK vapers was matched by gender and age to a sampling
frame of demographic characteristics from a representa-
tive sample of UK quitters (Table 1). This sample size was
adequate to reach saturation of experiences and key
themes [22]. Cross-sectional semi-structured qualitative
interviews were conducted between September 2016 and
May 2017.

for
interviews
(face-to-face or telephone). Semi-structured guides took
a narrative approach to explore participant histories of
tobacco smoking and prior quit attempts, through to
e-cigarette initiation and whether this was part of an
intended quit attempt. Patterns of e-cigarette use were
explored. We asked participants to describe the devices
they
used
and
the
nicotine
e-liquid
(flavour
and
strength) they had started with and then to describe in
detail any changes in patterns of use or vaping setups
over time. Simultaneously, we asked participants to de-
scribe the situations and experience of any lapse or re-
lapse to tobacco smoking where this had occurred. We
asked participants to reflect on their future intentions
and identity-related aspects of vaping. Interviews were
transcribed
verbatim
and
anonymised.
Participant
codes used to reference quotes refer to participant’s
gender and age (e.g. ‘F24’ for ‘female aged 24’). Tran-
scripts were thematically analysed [23] systematically
case-by-case independently by both CN and EW, with a
10% independent coding check undertaken, whereby
both analysts coded the same transcripts and compared
coding. The analysis was discussed at regular team
meetings, and anomalies were agreed by consensus. In-
dividual case summaries were written to facilitate
cross-case comparison, and pathways diagrams were
plotted to illustrate participant journeys through smok-
ing cessation.
Results
Participants’ mean age was 41 (SD 14.0, range 21–70)
(Table 2), and gender was split equally. All participants
identified
as
White
British
or
European,
16
were
employed in managerial, professional or technical occu-
pations. 33 were recruited in East Anglia with the re-
mainder located across other parts of England. Vaping
experience varied from starting two weeks before the
interview to seven years. 31 participants were vaping
and abstinent from tobacco (19 had reported lapses), six
participants had relapsed (five dual using both tobacco
and vaping) and three were no longer using either
e-cigarettes or tobacco.
Pathways through smoking cessation and initiating
vaping
Figure 1 provides a summary of the total sample encap-
sulating reported pathways through initiating e-cigarette
use and quitting tobacco smoking.
Most of our sample reported long histories of tobacco
smoking and multiple previous quit attempts However, a
minority (seven people) had never seriously attempted
to quit smoking. These people stated that they enjoyed
smoking and had no particular desire to quit:
I’d never wanted to enough, you know, obviously
I’m very aware of the health effects and what not,
but I always just enjoyed it too much, and that
always took precedent over the health side of
things, yes, so I’d never tried, cos I didn’t want
to enough, and I knew that you really have to
want to do it (F24)

 Accidental quitters
Those in our sample who stated that they had not
intended to quit smoking had tried vaping on a whim or
because they been offered by friends. In these cases, in-
dividuals found that they liked it or saw that it offered
potential as a substitute for smoking:
one evening I went to the local shop, which is very
close to here, to get some cigarettes, and they had run
out of the brand that I smoked, and I don’t know
why, but instead of choosing another brand which I
could of done, and occasionally had done in the past,
I said ‘oh well, I’ll try one of those e things, I’ll just try
one’ and so I bought it, it was a disposable thing and
looking back on it, it didn’t taste very nice, it had a
sort of metallic taste to it, and I know that it wasn’t a
brand that I would now seek out, but I did, that’s
what I did, I just bought it and brought it home, and I
said to my wife that evening, ‘you know, this is all
right, it’s sufficiently satisfying’ (ok) that I think I
might investigate this (ok) and I have never smoked
tobacco since that day (really), not one drag, and I
have never felt that I wanted to (M63)
The narrative here demonstrates vaping is experi-
enced as a ‘revelation’ in terms of quickly and easily

 substituting
previous
smoking
behaviour.
In
this
narrative, the smoking quit attempt is ‘accidental’:
it felt like I was smoking, so I didn’t have to kind of
think up displacement activities, I didn’t have to find
something else to do with myself, I could do exactly
what I’d always done, just with a slightly different
device, and yes, I really, really took to it, and within
five days I’d chucked out the last of my cigarettes…
but you know within 5 days I’d stopped completely
without meaning to (F38)
Many people discussed how they felt that e-cigarette
use was a ‘no pressure’ approach to quitting:
it was a natural progression because I enjoyed it, it
was easy to do, I didn’t even think about, like I
said, if I put myself under pressure I probably fail
at it, and think ‘oh, I have to do this’
, but as I
didn’t, I just, it just organically happened really for
me (F34)
The success of vaping as an aid to quitting smoking
can therefore be understood both in terms of the satisfy-
ing physical substitution of nicotine delivery, but also
the psychological and social relief of not declaring one-
self as ‘quitting smoking’
, thus not setting oneself up to
potentially fail. This is in contrast to the ‘success/failure’
narrative experienced in the past when attempting to
quit smoking by other means:
absolutely lousy, feel like a complete failure (right)…
you know you’ve put in an awful lot of effort, you’ve
gone through all of the struggle of getting off of an
addiction, and to fall so easily into an addiction that is
very, very easy to fall back into (yes, yes)…you know
it’s an awful feeling (M44)
Purposeful quitters
Most of our sample had initiated e-cigarette use because
they actively wanted to quit smoking:
gum wasn’t going to cut it basically and the patches
just didn’t seem like a good idea to me I didn’t think I
wasn’t to make a real attempt and patches and gum
weren’t going to work so actually try something that
may possibly work (M30).
For these people, e-cigarette use was experienced as sub-
stantially different from other smoking cessation support.
There were important strategies employed that may have
impacted on the outcome. Some people tried to equate a
number of cigarettes smoked to liquid strength, usually
with the guidance of a shop [24] or peers who were experi-
enced vapers:
The guy in the shop spoke to me about, like, how
many I smoked a day, how often I smoked, what I was
smoking, that kind of stuff and cos you can go up to
24 mg, but he said no because I was only on ten
[cigarettes a day] (right) so 18 was probably the best
one to start on (M36)
Switching
Many of our sample switched quickly and completely
from smoking to vaping:
having tried so often and failed so often and not
having got on with anything else, I was expecting it to
be really really hard (ok) but I think the combination
of finding something that reproduced the experience
but without so many of the carcinogens was the thing
that worked for me. So I found it remarkably easy, it
sounds silly to say, but having tried and failed so
often, having been a smoker for such a long time I
didn’t find it hard. (M53)
Participants described how easy it was to quit using
this method and how they enjoyed vaping in its own
right. This suggests that vaping offers something add-
itional to nicotine replacement—it is a pleasurable
alternative.
I think the ways of giving up that as far as I know are
on offer at the moment with, you know, gum and
patches and stuff like that, that helps with the physical
cravings, but it doesn’t help with the habits, and it
doesn’t help with the feeling of breathing something
in and breathing smoke out, which, you know, which
is such a fundamental part of smoking that, you
know, I think I wouldn’t have given up if those had
been the only alternatives offered (F38)
For others, vaping was viewed as a continuum with
smoking, as opposed to a method of smoking cessation.
For these people, using an e-cigarette was not seen as
giving up smoking, just smoking in a different way.
There was a level of comfortableness with addiction to
nicotine, seeing it as acceptable as a harm-reducing way
of using nicotine:
To actually have [nicotine] in the form of an e-cigarette
can be more effective than nicotine chewing gum or
nicotine patches cos they’re basically a method of
stopping smoking and stopping the addiction to
nicotine aren’t they? Whereas e-cigarettes, you’ve still
Notley et al. Harm Reduction Journal  (2018) 15:31 
Page 5 of 12
 got the addiction to nicotine but the method that
you’re ingesting it is can be as, you know, not far off as
satisfying as having a cigarette (M49)
Sliding
Employing the ‘no pressure’ strategy, some people found
themselves naturally ‘sliding’ towards smoking cessa-
tion—initially ‘dual using’ both tobacco and e-cigarettes,
but over time coming to use e-cigarettes more and even-
tually completely vaping and being tobacco-free:
I didn’t stop like one day… as one went down and the
other went up (ok) so it sort of replaced one with the
other rather than cold turkey…I think once I started
to do this because it was around, and actually like, if
you’re at home I could smoke it (the e cigarette)
whereas the other one (tobacco) I’d have, I didn’t
really smoke at home, I would have had to go outside
or whatever (yes) it was easier to smoke it (the e
cigarette), so that made it better (yes) and then at
some point I thought ‘I’m not buying another packet’
(of tobacco cigarettes), so then you sort of force the
issue and you’re not smoking much at all (F36b)
Sliding appears to be a novel experience in terms of smok-
ing cessation, suggesting an important route into fully quit-
ting tobacco smoking for some people, particularly those
who dual use or do not actively want to quit smoking.
Relapse after initiating
Despite initial success, that for some people was easily
maintained, a majority of people either fully relapsed
[16] or dual used [8] after purchasing their first device.
For some, this was because they were not actually ini-
tially attempting to give up smoking. For others, brief
lapse to tobacco smoking occurred due to social or emo-
tional reasons. However, importantly, lapse for these
people did not appear to be as catastrophic as it may
have been in the past, as it did not necessarily lead to
full relapse [21].
However, for many, relapse/dual use occurred after
initiation due to inferiorities in the first device pur-
chased. Although a few people in the sample did manage
to maintain full smoking abstinence using a device that
they did not find fully satisfying, most people did not
manage to maintain abstinence initially. The reasons
people gave for their first device being inferior were
mostly related to first generation or ‘cig-a-like’ type de-
vices, which were generally experienced as unsatisfying:
I think they had them in the shop down the road, just
like the ones that looked like a cigarette, so I tried
that to start with, but they’re not very good, I don’t
think, and if you’re seriously thinking of you’re, like
swapping that for cigarettes, for those sort of ones I
think you try them, and think, ‘actually they’re nothing
like it’ and (yes) and I think that puts a lot of people
off (F46)
Others reported that the first devices they tried were
inadequate or continually malfunctioned:
I did try e-cigarettes before in the past, about early
2010 let’s say, but I didn’t really like them. They just
didn’t work too well, they were spitting liquid nicotine
in your mouth and awful stuff like that, so that was
definitely a no go for me. (M22)
Avoiding relapse to tobacco smoking
Finding an effective and satisfying vaping setup
Through trialling different setups, most people in our
sample had eventually achieved abstinence by getting
the right vaping setup and learning to vape in patterns
that met their needs. For some, this was a personal quest
and a process of trial and error, whereas others sought
support from other vapers, forums or vape shops.
just picking up an e-cigarette from a newsagent and
taking a puff and thinking no, that’s no good, isn’t the
end of the story, because there are different brands,
different tastes, different strengths and flavours, you
can get it right, and it can be a substitute (M63)
Participants had strategies that they had learnt over
time to ensure their e-cigarette setup was reliable:
The batteries, I weren’t too sure how long they would
last and when I first started I thought “oh my god
what about if that run out?” and so I bought another
one exactly the same (ok) so I have one battery on
and one already charged up. (F60)
Developing patterns of use that are helpful in maintaining
abstinence from smoking
Participants described varying individualised patterns of
use of their e-cigarette. The key point is that, over time,
individuals came to vape in patterns that they found ac-
ceptable, enjoyable and that were sufficiently satisfying
so that they did not experience strong cravings for to-
bacco. For some, patterns of vaping directly replicated
previous patterns of smoking:
it was beside my car from when I got in from work,
sit down, cup of tea and the e-cigarette, so exactly
when I would have previously have had a couple of
Notley et al. Harm Reduction Journal  (2018) 15:31 
Page 6 of 12
 cigarettes, and then again during the evening after a
meal, coffee and the e-cigarette, so exactly when I
would have had two or three more, watching televi-
sion during the evening, and so on (F62)
However, for many, patterns of vaping were very dif-
ferent from previous patterns of smoking. Particularly,
people vaped in places they would not previously have
smoked (in the house, in bed, in the car, ‘in secret’ at
work). The majority ‘grazed’ on their device throughout
the day and could not really say how often they used
their e-cigarette or how many puffs they took. This was
contrasted to smoking:
I feel like I’m grazing on it constantly (yes), whereas with
a cigarette it’s, you know, when it’s done you’ve had
enough because it’s finished, whereas with [e-cig] I never
really know when I’ve had enough I suppose. (F36)
For some, the ‘grazing’ pattern of vaping meant that they
tended to vape little and often, which may well have im-
pacted on nicotine levels in the body, such that people used
the e-cigarette to avoid craving through nicotine withdrawal:
I use it all day long, whenever, I suppose nicotine
withdrawal is kicking in, but I’m not doing it for the
numerous minutes that smoking a cigarette can take,
so it’s often two or three inhales, back in the pocket of
the handbag, forget it for a little while (F62)
Participants’ beliefs towards grazing behaviour were
generally positive:
That was the annoying thing about cigarettes, they
stop and you’ve got to then say right I’m not going to
light another one I’m going to leave it for a certain
amount of time, so you immediately start withdrawing
as soon as you’ve stubbed one out. You’re kind of like
‘I want another one now, but I’m not going to’ and
then ‘oh I’ll give in, I’ll have another one’
, but with this
I have one little puff every now and then. (F52)
However, some were perturbed by the grazing pattern
of use and worried that this meant they may be increas-
ing their addiction to nicotine:
It’s so easy and less invasive I probably, yes I don’t
know, if I vape more than I would smoke (M40)
Potential factors in supporting smoking abstinence
Replication of smoking
For those at the time of interview reporting vaping and
abstinence from smoking, vaping was discussed as
similar to smoking in meeting nicotine addiction needs,
thus assisting the individual to avoid tobacco smoking
relapse:
the vaporiser is a very similar form of receiving the
nicotine whereas if you just stick a mint (NRT) in
your mouth that’s completely different to smoking
(M37)
Ex-smokers also used their e-cigarette to meet psycho-
logical needs, e.g. e-cigarettes were used as part of the
pattern and routine of everyday life, as a direct substitu-
tion for when cigarettes might previously have been
used:
even the addiction, like the nicotine necessarily, I
don’t think it’s the habit of it, and the like, it’s very
embedded in my psyche, like, I enjoy going and
standing outside in the evening and having a cigarette,
it’s not even, I mean the cigarette is a big part of it,
but it’s the habit and the like, the ritual of it as well
(F24)
E-cigarettes were enjoyed due to the habitual aspects
of vaping that mirrored previous smoking behaviour.
The ‘hand-to-mouth’ action, holding something in the
hand, breathing vapour into the lungs and blowing our
vapour were all mentioned as important behavioural as-
pects that potentially contributed to the prevention of
tobacco smoking relapse:
part of my problem has always been it’s a habit
and it’s having it in your hand and sticking it in
your mouth so it’s a replacement it’s a direct
replacement for doing, putting something in your
hand, and it generates smoke and I know that
sounds daft but the e-lite thing didn’t make that
much smoke, and it’s weird when you’re smoking a
cigarette for it not to make smoke, so it sort of
ticked all those boxes and it actually tasted nicer
than a cigarette (F36)
Socially, vaping was experienced by many as an alter-
native to smoking. Unlike with previous smoking quit at-
tempts, vapers felt that they did not have to distance
themselves from their existing social networks in order
to avoid smoking relapse:
some people get into that routine I suppose, where
they still quite like to have that time away from
their desk and walk outside, cos that’s what they
were used to when they were smokers, so they’ll go
and stand outside in the smoking section, but
they’ll vape (M37)
Notley et al. Harm Reduction Journal  (2018) 15:31 
Page 7 of 12
 Vaping facilitated a sense of belonging to a specific
social group for some:
[There’s] a big community […] I see fellow vapers in
town we just we just sort of give each other a look, we
look at each others mods, it’s sort of like the classic
“oh you’re a vaper, hi” the whole community is all
one. [F21]
Identity
The social acceptance of vaping suggests that vaping
met the identity needs of some of our sample. For those
who had previously strongly associated with a smoker
identity, vaping offered an alternative attractive identity:
I can well see that, well I know people that are quite
content to be vapers for the rest of their life, you
know, they haven’t even got any interest in coming off
the nicotine and they’re at a level that they’re
comfortable with, and they do view themselves as
vapers, and they’re going to remain vapers, because
that’s what they’re happy with, you know, so from that
element, you know, there’s an awful lot of diversity
out there, there’s a lot to keep them interested, and I
don’t view that as a negative thing, you know, it’s a
good thing (M44)
Here, it is clear that there are numerous potential vap-
ing identities available within the category of ‘vaper’. For
some, associating with one of these vaping identities
clearly supported continued vaping and may have played
a role in tobacco relapse prevention. However, for
others, the ‘vaper’ identity was minimised in favour of an
‘ex-smoker’ identity, positioning oneself differently from
those who identified with the social and cultural aspects
of vaping:
[I see myself as] an ex smoker. I would say an ex
smoker I think, but there’s still the nicotine addiction
there. I don’t know if I would really call myself a
vaper. I vape but, you know, it’s still something that I,
yes I don’t sometimes. I’ll always be a smoker, it’s
something that’s never going to sort of go away, but
now I can start saying I’m actually or become an
ex-smoker (F46)
Pleasure
As well as substituting physical, psychological, social and
cultural elements of previous tobacco smoking behav-
iour, vaping was frequently discussed as enjoyable and
pleasurable in its own right—sometime above and
beyond how tobacco smoking was perceived:
it often smells quite pleasant and the vapour
dissipates quite quickly, it doesn’t stick to clothing, so
you know I think people have got a better perception
of it rather than tobacco smoke (M37)
Flavours and smells, the sensory aspect of vaping, were
an important and pleasurable aspect:
it’s probably one of the most important things in a
way, in a sense, that if it was flavourless I don’t think
it would really have, it’s actively pleasurable, it’s a nice
thing. It’s that bit that means it’s fundamentally
different in my mind between a patch or chewing
gum or the spray. (M39)
Practicalities
Practical aspects, such as reduced cost compared to
smoking, accessibility and ease of use, were important in
discussing continued e-cigarette use:
if you’re spending a lot of money on cigarettes it,
you know, it’s a massive saving when you switch to
vaping (F40)
Accessibility
was
multi-faceted.
E-cigarettes
were
enjoyed because of their accessibility for everyday use
and convenience:
It’s a small little tight unit that fits in my pocket. Yes
just it just does everything and its tiny, I think that’s
the thing that works for me, it’s small, compact and
it’s not much hassle. (M26)
Partly, the convenience aspect was enjoyed as vaping
could be easily and discreetly incorporated into everyday
situations:
I didn’t have to go outside and stand out there in the
cold for five or ten minutes while I smoked the
cigarette. I could just sort of, when the wife’s not
looking (yes) have a quick puff (M70)
Perceived health benefits
Participants discussed multiple perceived health benefits
that corresponded to the health benefits of quitting
smoking, as they remained abstinent from smoking by
vaping:
I could tell that my sort of breathing was a lot better,
my skin was good, my teeth were good, hair and nails
were growing well, and generally just felt a lot better
in myself (F27)
Notley et al. Harm Reduction Journal  (2018) 15:31 
Page 8 of 12
 As well as improved respiratory function, which was
frequently discussed, marked improvements in sensa-
tions of taste and small were noted:
In the first sort of six weeks I noticed the usual sort of,
blimey what’s that nasty smell, I never used to smell that
before, but yes the usual taste and smell thing. (M58)
Future intentions
Some ‘invested vapers’ saw themselves as invested in
vaping as a hobby or were interested in the technical as-
pects of it. They viewed it as a fairly significant part of
their life. It had become more than a smoking cessation
aid and was an enjoyable pastime in its own right.
Therefore, they had no intention to quit:
I have no wish to wean myself off… I don’t look at it
now as a keeping me off the cigarettes, cos I don’t
want a cigarette at all, so it’s not really keeping me off
the cigarettes, it’s a hobby now, and a social thing,
and thats, I will carry on vaping because, you know,
it’s a hobby and a social thing (M67)
Others were really enthusiastic about how vaping had
enabled them to easily stop smoking. These ‘enthusiastic
switchers’ felt vaping had been successful mainly for its
ability to replicate smoking in terms of satisfying crav-
ings and the enjoyment they got from smoking:
I’m addicted to nicotine, so yes, yes, I’m a vaper but I’m
not one of these big beardy weirdy hipsters who just
spends all day long, you know, going harping on about
this new thing and that new thing, and this massive
cloud, and so I’m not like that, I’m an ex-smoker who is
addicted to nicotine, so I won’t be giving it up because
it’s got nicotine (M41)
This group was happy to continue to vape. They were
concerned that if they reduced their vaping, they would be
vulnerable to tobacco smoking relapse. Therefore, although
they were not fully invested in a vaping identity as with the
above group, they discussed no intention to quit vaping.
Many invested vapers and enthusiastic switchers were
completely
comfortable
having
a
dependence
on
nicotine:
I’m kind of a little resigned to having a nicotine
addiction. That seemed a particularly good way of
satisfying it without going back to sort of smoking
excessively. (M49)
However, a very different group, ‘nicotine quitters’
were people who had quit e-cigarettes or were intending
to. They mainly viewed e-cigarettes as a smoking cessa-
tion aid to help them eventually quit nicotine altogether:
I think some people see it as more like a hobby, it’s
like, now I’m not smoking I’m going to vape, but I see
it more like cutting down, using it to quit, and then I
want to get rid it, and then only use it if I need it for
social occasions (F22)
In contrast to the other groups, many of those who
wanted to quit e-cigarettes wanted to because they were
uncomfortable having a dependency:
I don’t like the idea of being addicted to anything. It’s
not, I don’t think nicotine is 100% safe, I know it’s a
lot better vaping than you know smoking cigarettes,
so you know I’m quite pleased we’ve done that bit,
but I just feel so silly having this prop. (F59)
Discussion
Our findings demonstrate that e-cigarettes may be a
unique harm reduction intervention for smoking relapse
prevention. Particularly, vaping was shown in our data
to be an attractive option offering a route into smoking
cessation for those people who did not initially want to
stop smoking, or have found it difficult to stop smoking
using other means of cessation support. Many of these
people would not consider seeking formal support from
a healthcare professional to quit smoking, but might try
vaping on a whim or because they are offered, and sub-
sequently go on to ‘accidentally quit’. This point is
critical not just for initial smoking cessation but for sup-
porting long-term abstinence from tobacco smoking.
Vaping was perceived qualitatively differently to other
forms of smoking cessation support, offering a pleasur-
able and enjoyable alternative to smoking. Vaping was
discussed as meeting the needs of our sample of
ex-smokers
by
substituting
physical,
psychological,
social, cultural and identity-related aspects of tobacco
addiction. Indeed, for many, the potential of vaping as
‘better than smoking’ suggests that sliding or switching
to vaping is a viable long-term substitute for smoking.
In line with the principles of a harm reduction
approach to ‘treatment’ of addictive behaviours, our
findings suggest that many smokers enjoy and do not
wish to quit smoking unless there is an equally enjoyable
alternative. In this respect, vaping is attractive. In first
trying vaping, those who initiated use experimentally or
on a whim often reported periods of dual use, corre-
sponding to other qualitative evidence [25]. Our data on
patterns of vaping over time suggest that ‘sliding’ to-
wards cessation without purposefully meaning to quit
smoking was an important pattern. Thus, positioning
Notley et al. Harm Reduction Journal  (2018) 15:31 
Page 9 of 12
 dual use as problematic may be premature; instead, we
might helpfully see dual use on a trajectory to smoking
cessation and support accordingly [26].
A discourse of the importance of pleasure in tobacco
harm reduction is emerging [27]. This was a strong
theme in our data. Pleasure as an emotion, desire or
simply a state of being intersects with the concept of
identity, since humans naturally engage in pleasurable or
rewarding behaviours that bolster self-esteem and con-
firm a positive sense of social identity [28]. It has been
demonstrated that identity change is a prerequisite to
successful long-term smoking abstinence [29–31], and
where the ex-smoker identity is disrupted, consequen-
tially, relapse may occur [18]. Importantly, our findings
demonstrate that vaping offers the availability of a range
of alternative identities [32] that are culturally and so-
cially acceptable to ex-smokers.
Our data detailing varied but patterned pathways
through initiating vaping clearly suggest that smoking
cessation by vaping is a process that unfolds over time.
Individuals described how they frequently experimented
with first generation ‘cig-a-like’ devices, which were gen-
erally found to be ineffective, before finding a vaping
setup that suited their individualised needs and prefer-
ences. For practically supporting ex-smokers to quit
smoking and to prevent relapse, this suggests that vapers
need ongoing support and advice, firstly to find a suit-
able vaping setup and, secondly, to learn to use the de-
vice in patterns that are acceptable and that substitute
the habit of smoking sufficiently, from a physical, psy-
chological and social perspective. Finally, vapers need
ongoing support to troubleshoot problems, such as diffi-
culties with device function, in order to prevent poten-
tial tobacco smoking relapse, as continuing to vape is
associated with continued abstinence from smoking [33].
Theoretically, our findings shift the paradigm of think-
ing related to smoking relapse prevention, through illu-
minating the unique ability of e-cigarettes to substitute
psychosocial, psychological and social aspects that were
previously enjoyed about smoking. Development of the-
ory in this way is likely to contribute to interventions in-
corporating individual choice, agency, situated social and
cultural influences and peer support as important di-
mensions, in order to reduce the harm associated with
tobacco smoking. This is in contrast, but may be incor-
porated into, previous models of smoking relapse pre-
vention, which were primarily psychological, focused on
motivation and cue-driven behaviour [34].
A limitation of our work is that the data and thus con-
clusions are drawn from a cross-sectional qualitative
sample. Our methods sought to answer open exploratory
questions about the experience of e-cigarette use and
patterns of use that may or may not support smoking re-
lapse prevention. Although purposive, we matched our
sample using a sampling frame to a nationally represen-
tative sample of UK quitters [35]. Despite our best ef-
forts, the sample under-represents older populations of
ex-smokers, those from lower socio-economic groups
and ethnic minorities. Fully relapsed smokers we found
‘hard to reach’
, perhaps due to shame and stigma associ-
ated with relapsed tobacco use. However, we are able to
draw conclusions about relapse prevention in the con-
text of vaping, since many of our sample reported ex-
periencing relapse after initiating e-cigarette use, but had
subsequently gone on to achieve abstinence through ex-
perimentation with different devices and vaping setups.
Thus, although our findings are not statistically general-
isable, we are reassured that they have transferability
and could be reliably confirmed.
There was a divide in our sample between those who
intended to continue to use e-cigarettes and those who
eventually wanted to stop using nicotine altogether, as
supported by other qualitative work [32]. This demon-
strates some level of engagement with wider public
health debates about the potential long-term utility of
vaping as a harm reduction approach for smoking re-
lapse prevention versus concerns about long-term use—
the duality of e-cigarettes delivering nicotine as both a
‘poison’ and a ‘remedy’ [8]. Future research might use-
fully explore these stated intentions against long-term
outcomes. A larger quantitative sample could explore as-
sociations over time between devices, patterns of use
and abstinence outcomes, as we hypothesise based on
our qualitative data that devices, e-liquids, patterns of
use and stated intentions may all potentially impact on
long-term tobacco abstinence. Eventually, we propose
that
future
research
might
formally
test
an
e-cigarette-based relapse prevention intervention, which
critically must incorporate consumer choice and peer
support beyond the intervention of the e-cigarette.
Conclusions
This paper presents novel qualitative data on patterns of
vaping over time and suggests potential factors, drawing
on participant perspectives, in supporting long-term to-
bacco smoking abstinence. Findings show that, for this
sample, e-cigarettes are a unique innovation supporting
smoking relapse prevention. E-cigarettes are particularly
attractive to ex-smokers, as having the right vaping setup
is intrinsically satisfying and pleasurable. For many, vaping
comes to be preferred over time to tobacco smoking, par-
ticularly as the user becomes more experienced and ex-
periments until they are able to find an individualised
setup that meets their needs. For some, e-cigarettes can
substitute the physical, psychological, social, cultural and
identity-related dimensions that were previously enjoyed
about tobacco smoking, and thus may uniquely support
long-term smoking relapse prevention. Many vapers were
Notley et al. Harm Reduction Journal  (2018) 15:31 
Page 10 of 12
 happy with their identity as a vaper and comfortable with
nicotine addiction, but others saw e-cigarettes as a
short-term smoking cessation intervention and eventually
aimed to quit vaping as well as tobacco smoking. Vaping
attracted some ex-smokers who had never intended to
quit smoking and offered a viable and long-term alterna-
tive to tobacco smoking that was experienced as support-
ing relapse prevention.
