Prognostication after cardiac arrest

Abstract
Hypoxic–ischaemic brain injury (HIBI) is the main
cause of death in patients who are comatose after
resuscitation from cardiac arrest. A poor neurological
outcome—defined as death from neurological cause,
persistent vegetative state, or severe neurological
disability—can be predicted in these patients by
assessing the severity of HIBI. The most commonly
used indicators of severe HIBI include bilateral absence
of corneal and pupillary reflexes, bilateral absence of N2O
waves of short-latency somatosensory evoked potentials,
high blood concentrations of neuron specific enolase,
unfavourable patterns on electroencephalogram, and
signs of diffuse HIBI on computed tomography or
magnetic resonance imaging of the brain. Current
guidelines recommend performing prognostication
no earlier than 72 h after return of spontaneous
circulation in all comatose patients with an absent
or extensor motor response to pain, after having
excluded confounders such as residual sedation that
may interfere with clinical examination. A
multimodal approach combining multiple
prognostication tests is recommended so that the
risk of a falsely pessimistic prediction is minimised.

Background
About 80% of patients who are admitted to an intensive
care unit (ICU) after resuscitation from out-of-hospital
cardiac arrest (OHCA) are comatose [1] and two thirds of
them will die because of hypoxic–ischaemic brain injury
(HIBI) [2, 3]. Severe HIBI causes delayed neuronal death
[4–6] and diffuse brain oedema [7, 8]. However, only a
minority of these deaths occur as a direct consequence of
massive neuronal injury (i.e. from brain death) [9]. In fact,

most deaths caused by HIBI result from withdrawal of
life-sustaining treatment (WLST) following prognostica-
tion of a poor neurological outcome [10, 11].
To avoid premature WLST in patients with a chance of
neurological recovery, the risk of a falsely pessimistic
prediction should be kept to a minimum. In other words,
when predicting a poor neurological outcome, the false
positive rate (FPR) (i.e. the ratio between the number of
patients with a falsely pessimistic prediction divided by the
number of patients with good neurological outcome) of
the index used should ideally be zero, or their specificity
should be 100%. However, even the most robust neuro-
logical predictors are not 100% specific; for this reason,
the current guidelines [12, 13] recommend using a
combination of predictors. These may include clinical
neurological examination, electrophysiological investiga-
tions (electroencephalogram (EEG) and short-latency som-
atosensory evoked potentials (SSEP)), serum biomarkers,
and neuroimaging. The characteristics of these categories
of predictors are discussed in this article.
The aims of the present review are to summarise the
current knowledge on the prediction of neurological
outcome in patients who are comatose after CA and to
provide practical recommendations on how to perform
an accurate neuroprognostication in these patients.
What represents a poor neurological outcome?
The most commonly used measure for reporting neuro-
logical outcome after CA is represented by Cerebral
Performance Categories (CPCs) [14]. CPC 1 corresponds to
the best possible outcome (no or minor disabilities) while
CPC 5 corresponds to death (Table 1). The CPC was
adapted from the Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) for
traumatic head injury. The GOS scores correspond to those
of the CPCs in inverse order; that is, GOS 1 corresponds to
CPC 5 and vice versa. Despite its simplicity and widespread
use, the CPC has been criticised for being too focused on
mental function and less informative about body functions,
activity, and participation [15], which may explain the
reported lack of agreement between the CPC and subjective
quality of life measures [16]. Alternatives to the CPC
include the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) [17], which

 includes a 7-point scale ranging from 0 (no symptoms) to 6
(death), and the extended GOS (GOSE) [18]. The GOSE
categories range from 1 (death) to 8 (upper good recovery)
and include important information such as independence
at home and outside home, work capacity, social activities,
and return to normal life. All of these scales have limita-
tions and none has been specifically designed to describe
the outcome after global HIBI.
For clarity and for statistical purposes, in neuroprognosti-
cation studies the neurological outcome is generally dichot-
omised as ‘good’ or ‘poor’. However, there is no definite
consensus on what represents a poor neurological outcome.
Up to 2006, the majority of neuroprognostication studies
defined poor outcome as CPC 4–5 (vegetative state or
death) and a good outcome as CPC 1–3 (good neurological
outcome and moderate to severe neurological disability). In
the last 10 years, however, most studies included severe
neurological disability (CPC 3) among the poor outcomes
[19] (Fig. 1). This reflects different values and preferences
in relation to neurological status after CA. These include
giving priority to recovery of consciousness vs recovery of
physical and neurological ability, and societal participation.
Unfortunately, this heterogeneity causes confusion in the
interpretation of results of neuroprognostication studies
and prevents pooling the overall evidence in meta-analysis.
For this reason, reporting the prevalence of all individual
outcome categories in neuroprognostication studies would
be desirable.
The latest version of the Utstein guidelines on outcome
reporting after OHCA suggested that when dichotomising
neurological outcome the CPC 3–5 threshold (or mRS 4–6)
should be used for defining poor outcome. This definition
will probably be updated if other outcome measures such
as the GOSE are adopted to describe the outcome of CA in
the near future.
The timing of neurological outcome assessment also af-
fects its measured values, since in initially comatose car-
diac arrest survivors neurological status can improve for
up to 6 months after the event [20]. Optimal times for as-
sessment of neurological outcome after cardiac arrest have
yet to be established. However, 3 months after cardiac
arrest seems to balance opportunity for observing im-
provement while minimising loss to follow-up [21].
Health-related quality of life
Neurological status is a major determinant of overall
functional outcome. However, measures of neurological
status do not directly reflect overall functional outcome
after cardiac arrest. Restoring the pre-arrest health-related
quality of life (HRQOL) is the ultimate goal of resuscitation.
Unfortunately, cardiac arrest survivors report cognitive
impairment, restricted mobility, depression, and restricted
societal participation after hospital discharge [22]. The
recent ILCOR Advisory Statement on Core Outcome Set
for Cardiac Arrest (COSCA) [23] in adults recommends
including HRQOL assessed at a minimum of 3 months
among the core outcome measures to be measured after
cardiac arrest. Inclusion of HRQOL among measured out-
comes in future neuroprognostication studies is desirable.

 of the European Resuscitation Council (ERC) and the
European Society of Intensive Care Medicine (ESICM) [12,
13] state that neuroprognostication can be considered in
patients who, after having excluded major confounders
such as residual sedation, are still unconscious and have an
absent or extensor motor response to pain (Glasgow Coma
Scale (GCS) Motor score ≤ 2) at 72 h or later after ROSC
(Fig. 2). As a sign of poor neurological outcome, a GCS
Motor score ≤ 2 at 72 h has low specificity but its sensitiv-
ity is high—around 70–80% [25, 26]—and it can therefore
be used to identify patients with the most severe HIBI
needing neuroprognostication.
A bilaterally absent pupillary light reflex (PLR) at ≥ 72 h
from ROSC has a high specificity for predicting poor
neurological outcome (FPR < 5% with narrow confidence
intervals) [27]. However, its sensitivity is low [26, 28].
Moreover, standard PLR is a qualitative measure based on
subjective assessment, which has raised some concerns
about
its
reproducibility
[29].
Automated
infrared
pupillometry provides a quantitative measure of pupil size,
PLR, and constriction velocity, and is emerging as a novel
modality to evaluate brainstem function at the bedside in
critically ill patients [30]. A recent study in 103 post-CA
comatose patients [31] showed that absence of pupillary
reactivity measured with automated infrared pupillometry
at 48 h after ROSC had higher specificity (100 (95% confi-
dence interval 93–100)% vs 96 (86–99.5)%) and sensitiv-
ity (61 (48–75)% vs 43 (29–58)%) than standard PLR
measured by certified neurologists. A multicentre pro-
spective study (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02607878) aim-
ing
to
validate
these
results

completed
recently.
A bilaterally absent corneal reflex at 72 h after ROSC
also indicates a likely poor outcome in patients who are
resuscitated from CA. However, the specificity of the
corneal reflex is slightly lower than that of the pupillary
reflex (4 (1–7)% in seven studies in TTM-treated pa-
tients [12]). One reason for this could be that the

 corneal reflex is more prone to interference from re-
sidual effects of sedatives or muscle relaxants than PLR.
Like PLR, the corneal reflex also has a low sensitivity.
Myoclonus
Myoclonus is a clinical phenomenon consisting of sudden,
brief, involuntary jerks caused by muscular contractions
or inhibitions. Presence of an early (≤ 48 h) post-anoxic
status myoclonus—defined as a continuous and general-
ised myoclonus persisting for ≥ 30 min in a patient who is
comatose after CA—is almost invariably associated with
poor neurological outcome. In rare cases, however, an
early-onset and generalised myoclonus may be associated
with neurological recovery in these patients. Myoclonus is
considered to be a less robust predictor than PLR and its
use is recommended only in combination with other
indices [13]. In particular, an EEG recording is recom-
mended in order to rule out other more benign forms of
post-anoxic myoclonus, such as Lance–Adams syndrome
(LAS) [32, 33]. LAS is a post-anoxic action myoclonus,
most often caused by asphyxial cardiac arrest, which be-
comes evident after awakening when a patient intentionally
moves his/her limbs and is restricted to the limb being
moved [33]. Elmer et al. [34] recently described two
distinct EEG patterns in 65 patients with post-anoxic
myoclonus: (a)
a
burst-suppression background with
high-amplitude polyspikes in lock-step with myoclonic
jerks; and (b) a continuous background with narrow, vertex
spike-wave discharges in lock-step with myoclonic jerks.
All patients with pattern (a) had poor outcome while 50%
of patients with pattern (b) survived with LAS.
Limitations of clinical examination
As clinical examination is prone to interference from body
temperature and from residual effects of sedatives and/or
neuromuscular blocking drugs, these confounders should
be carefully ruled out before starting the prognostication
process. Another limitation of predictors based on clinical
examination is that they cannot be concealed from the
treating team and therefore their results may poten-
tially influence
clinical management
and cause a
self-fulfilling prophecy.
Electrophysiology
Electroencephalogram
The EEG has long been used to assess the severity of
HIBI [35]. However, its widespread adoption as a pre-
dictor has been hampered by the lack of a consistent
classification of the different EEG patterns associated
with poor neurological outcome [26]. Because of this
inconsistency, the ERC–ESICM 2015 guidelines suggest
considering malignant EEG patterns (status epilepticus
or burst suppression after rewarming over an unreactive
background) only in association with other predictors. A
malignant EEG pattern not yet incorporated into the
major guidelines is the suppressed background, defined
as all EEG activity < 10 mV [36]. In comatose patients
with HIBI, a substantial inter-rater agreement (κ = 0.71)
among blinded assessors has been found [37] for the rec-
ognition of both burst suppression and suppressed back-
ground (with or without periodic discharges) defined
according to the standardised terminology of the American
Clinical Neurophysiology Society (ACNS) [36]. In a recent
study on 103 resuscitated comatose patients [38], the
presence of any of these two patterns on EEG recorded
at a median of 77 h after ROSC predicted poor neuro-
logical outcome with 100 (88–100)% specificity and 50
(39–61)% sensitivity.
There is recent evidence showing that the EEG can
provide important prognostic information even when
it is recorded within the first 24 h after ROSC. In a
study of 430 comatose resuscitated patients, poor
neurological outcome (CPC 3–5) at 6 months was
predicted accurately (specificity 100 (98–100)%) by one
of the following patterns on continuous EEG: isoelec-
tric, low-voltage (< 20 μV), or burst suppression with
identical bursts [39]. However, the overall sensitivity of
these signs was low (29 (22–36)%).
Another reason for monitoring the EEG in post-anoxic
coma is to detect seizures, which may potentially cause
secondary brain injury after HIBI. However, the benefit of
aggressive treatment of post-anoxic seizures is still uncer-
tain. A randomised trial (TELSTAR, ClinicalTrials.gov
NCT02056236) is ongoing to answer this question.
Automated EEG analysis
The interpretation of EEG patterns in comatose survivors
of CA is usually performed by neurophysiologists, and the
assessment of continuous EEG requires the analysis of a
considerable amount of data. Amplitude-integrated elec-
troencephalography (aEEG) provides a simplified and,
therefore, more suitable method for monitoring the EEG.
In a study of 130 comatose resuscitated patients treated
with targeted temperature management (TTM), absence of
recovery to a continuous normal voltage within 36 h from
ROSC on aEEG was 100 (93.5–100)% specific for poor
neurological outcome at 6 months [40].
The bispectral index (BIS), an automated analysis of the
EEG signal designed to monitor the depth of anaesthesia,
has also been evaluated as a prognostic tool after CA. BIS
values range from 100 (awake patient) to 0 (flat EEG). In
two studies [41, 42], a BIS value of 6 or less during TTM,
corresponding to a flat or low-amplitude EEG, predicted a
poor neurological outcome with 0 (0–6)% FPR.
On a continuous EEG recording, persistence of a
malignant pattern over time may be more significant
than a single value. In a recent study where the BIS
Sandroni et al. Critical Care  (2018) 22:150 
Page 4 of 9
 was recorded in 77 patients [43] a total duration of
BIS 0 for 30.3 min predicted a poor neurological out-
come with 63% sensitivity and 100% specificity (AUC
0.861; p = 0.007).
Short-latency somatosensory evoked potentials
Bilateral absence of the N2O cortical wave of SSEP at
72 h from ROSC predicts a poor neurological outcome
with high accuracy and precision (FPR 0.4 (0–2)%) [25].
The ERC–ESICM guidelines include an absence of the
N2O SSEP wave among the most robust predictors to be
tested at 72 h after ROSC (Fig. 2). However, SSEP sensi-
tivity rarely exceeds 50%. In other words, many patients
destined to a poor neurological outcome after CA have a
bilaterally present N2O SSEP wave. However, in these
patients, lower N2O amplitudes are sometimes observed.
Endisch et al. [44] measured the amplitude of the N2O
SSEP waves between day 1 and day 4 after ROSC in 293
comatose CA survivors. An amplitude ≤ 0.62 μV had
100 (98–100)% specificity and 57 (48–65)% sensitivity
for predicting a poor neurological outcome, defined as
CPC 4–5. If an absence of the N2O SSEP wave had been
adopted as a criterion for a positive test result, the SSEP
sensitivity would have been 30%.
An advantage of SSEP over EEG is that they are less
affected by sedation. However, they may be prone to
electrical interference. In a large prospective prognostica-
tion study in comatose survivors of CA [45], the SSEP of
three patients with good outcome were initially classified
as being bilaterally absent during TTM, but post-hoc
assessment from blinded neurophysiologists indicated that
these three SSEP recordings were actually undeterminable
because of excessive noise. In another 13 patients, SSEP
were present during TTM but subsequently disappeared
after rewarming. Current guidelines recommend record-
ing SSEP only after rewarming.
Biomarkers
Neuron specific enolase (NSE) and S-100B are protein bio-
markers released following injury to neurons and glial cells,
respectively. The rationale for their use for neuroprognosti-
cation is that their blood values are presumed to correlate
with the extent of HIBI from CA [46]. Unlike clinical
examination and EEG, concentrations of biomarkers are
unlikely to be affected by sedatives and are easy to assess
blindly, therefore preventing the self-fulfilling prophecy
bias. However, biomarker blood values are continuous
variables, which implies identifying a threshold when
dealing with dichotomous outcomes such as the neuro-
logical prognosis of CA. Unfortunately, it is difficult to
identify with a high degree of certainty a consistent
biomarker threshold for identifying patients destined for a
poor outcome. Biomarker thresholds vary with timing of
measurement, reflecting their kinetics following initial
release. An additional cause of inconsistency is the variabil-
ity of techniques used to measure biomarkers, which can
cause a significant systematic error between techniques
[47]. For these reasons, unlike previous recommendations,
[48] current guidelines [13] do not recommend any par-
ticular biomarker threshold to predict poor outcome with
100% specificity. An additional caveat for use of bio-
markers is represented by extracerebral sources, which
may cause false positive results. For NSE these include
red blood cells, neuroendocrine tumours, and small cell
carcinoma.
NSE is the most widely available and best documented
biomarker of cerebral injury. In the largest study so far
conducted on comatose survivors of CA (686 TTM-treated
patients, 1823 samples assessed blind) [49], the NSE values
corresponding to a false positive rate < 5% with the upper
boundary of the 95% confidence interval within 5% were
61, 46, and 35 ng/ml at 24, 48 and 72 h from ROSC,
respectively. Their corresponding sensitivities were 24, 59,
and 63%. Serial measurement did not significantly improve
the accuracy of prediction [50] over a single measurement
at 48 h. However, sampling at multiple time points (24,
48, and 72 h) is recommended by current guidelines, in
order to assess reproducibility and reduce the risk of a
false positive result.
Another promising biomarker is tau protein, a marker
of axonal injury. In a spin-off study of the TTM trial
[51] the blood values of tau protein at 24, 48, and 72 h
were measured using monoclonal antibodies in 689
patients. Results showed that a tau protein threshold of
11.2 ng/L at 72 h had 98 (96–99)% specificity and 66
(60–71)% sensitivity to predict poor neurological outcome
(CPC 3–5) at 6 months. The area under the receiver oper-
ating characteristic (ROC) curve of tau protein at 72 h was
higher than that of NSE (0.91 vs 0.86; p < 0.001). Its use,
however, is still limited to specialised laboratories.
Recently, microRNAs (miRNAs) have been identified
as candidate biomarkers for outcome prediction after
CA. miRNAs are RNA molecules 20–22 nucleotides
long which regulate gene expression. After global brain
ischaemia, neuronal miRNAs cross the disrupted blood–
brain barrier and can be measured in plasma. Their po-
tential advantage is their ability to provide information
not only on the severity of brain damage, but also on
neuronal cell function. Preliminary studies [52] indicate
that miR-124-3p is an independent predictor of both
survival and neurological outcome in patients who are
comatose after CA. Further investigation will be needed
to confirm the clinical utility of miRNAs in HIBI.
Near-infrared spectroscopy
Altered cerebral blood flow is considered one of the
mechanisms causing HIBI [53].
Sandroni et al. Critical Care  (2018) 22:150 
Page 5 of 9
 Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is a non-invasive
technique for monitoring regional cerebral oxygen satur-
ation (SctO2) at the microvascular level. In a study of
107 comatose resuscitated patients [54], the mean SctO2
during the first 48 h after ROSC in patients with poor
neurological outcome was significantly lower than in
those with good neurological outcome at 6 months (66
± 5% vs 68 ± 4%, respectively). Accuracy of SctO2, how-
ever, was low. At the best SctO2 threshold (55%), the
sensitivity and specificity were 52% and 55% respect-
ively and the area under the ROC curve was 0.58.
Further studies will be needed to assess the usefulness
of NIRS as a predictor of neurological outcome after
CA.
Imaging
Brain CT
The main CT finding of HIBI following CA is cerebral
oedema, which appears as an attenuation of the grey
matter/white matter (GM/WM) interface. This has been
measured as the ratio (GWR) between the GM and the
WM densities, which are usually sampled at three levels:
basal ganglia, centrum semiovale, and high convexity.
These changes occur early after CA. On brain CT per-
formed in comatose survivors of CA between 1 and 24 h
from ROSC, a GWR ranging between 1.16 and 1.22 pre-
dicted a poor neurological outcome (CPC 3–5) with 0%
FPR and sensitivities ranging from 28 to 76% [55–59].
However, in a single-centre study including 240 patients
with brain CT performed within 24 h from ROSC [60] a
GWR < 1.22 predicted hospital mortality with high
specificity (98 (91–100)%) but was unable to further
characterise survivors between those having poor vs
good outcome. The observed variability in GWR thresh-
olds among studies may be due partly to the heterogen-
eity of the methods used for GWR calculation, while the
variability in sensitivities may reflect the heterogeneous
causes of arrest. Cerebral oedema is more common after
arrest from non-cardiac causes [61].
There is presently no consensus on the optimal
technique for measuring GWR nor on timing for
performing brain CT for neuroprognostication in CA
patients, although in the vast majority of studies the
ROSC-to-CT interval was less than 24 h. A recent study
[62] based on the TTM trial cohort showed that
generalised oedema on brain CT detected visually by
local radiologists without formal GWR measurement
predicted poor neurological outcome (CPC 3–5) with
97.6
(91.8–9.4)%
specificity
and
14.4
(9.4–21.4)%
sensitivity within 24 h from ROSC. The same findings
from 24 h to 7 days after ROSC increased the specifi-
city and sensitivity to 100 (87.9–100.0)% and 56.5
(47.3–65.3)% respectively.
Magnetic resonance imaging
HIBI after CA appears on brain MRI as hyperintense areas
on diffusion weighted imaging (DWI). DWI changes are
due to a reduction in the random motion of water pro-
tons, caused by a failure of the energy-dependent active
water transport mechanisms due to HIBI. These changes
can be quantified using the apparent diffusion coefficient
(ADC). ADC thresholds for prediction of poor neuro-
logical outcome after CA have been measured as the
whole-brain ADC [55, 63], the proportion of brain volume
with low ADC [64, 65], and the lowest ADC value in spe-
cific brain areas that are most commonly affected by HIBI
[66]. These include the occipital cortex, deep grey nuclei,
hippocampus, and cerebellum. MRI was very accurate for
predicting poor neurological outcome in individual stud-
ies, but the methods used to calculate the severity of the
ischaemic lesions in the brain are heterogeneous.
Current prognostication guidelines suggest performing
brain MRI 2–5 days after ROSC. This timing is based on
results of early studies [67]; however, recent evidence
[55, 68] showed that MRI can predict neurological out-
come as early as 3 h after ROSC.
Given the few patients studied, the spatial and tem-
poral variability of post-anoxic changes in both CT and
MRI, and the lack of standardisation for quantitative
measures of these changes, current guidelines suggest
using brain imaging studies for prognostication after CA
only in combination with other predictors and in centres
where specific experience is available.
MRI has limited feasibility in the most unstable
patients, and this may also have introduced a selection
bias in prognostic studies based on MRI.
Predictors of good neurological outcome
The vast majority of evidence on neuroprognostication
after cardiac arrest concerns prediction of poor neuro-
logical outcome. However, some predictors of good neuro-
logical outcome have been identified in recent years.
Although these have not yet been included in international
guidelines, they may indicate the potential for recovery in
patients with uncertain prognosis and reduce the risk of an
inappropriate WLST. Most of these predictors are based
on electrophysiology and include the presence of a
continuous or nearly continuous EEG within 12 h from
ROSC [69], presence of early EEG reactivity [69, 70], and
improvement of auditory discrimination (an analysis of
EEG responses to auditory stimuli) from the first to the
second day after ROSC [71]. Absence of DWI abnormal-
ities on MRI within 1 week of ROSC is also highly suggest-
ive of good neurological outcome [67].
Suggested prognostication strategy
Most TTM-treated patients recover consciousness within
72 h from ROSC [72]. The ERC–ESICM guidelines on
Sandroni et al. Critical Care  (2018) 22:150 
Page 6 of 9
 post-resuscitation care [13] recommend the neuroprognos-
tication algorithm reported in Fig. 2 for all patients who re-
main comatose with an absent or extensor motor response
to pain at ≥ 72 h from ROSC. Results of earlier prognostic
tests should also be considered at this time. Before prog-
nostic assessment is performed, major confounders must
be excluded; these may include sedation, neuromuscular
blockade, hypothermia, severe hypotension, and metabolic
or respiratory derangements.
The most robust predictors (FPR < 5% for prediction of
poor outcome with narrow confidence interval docu-
mented in > 5 studies from at least three different groups
of investigators) should be evaluated first. These include bi-
laterally absent pupillary reflexes at ≥ 72 h after ROSC
and/or a bilaterally absent N2O SSEP wave after rewarm-
ing. If none of these signs is present, less robust predictors
with wider confidence intervals and/or an inconsistent
definition or threshold are considered. These include the
presence of early (< 48 h) status myoclonus, high serum
NSE values at 48–72 h after ROSC, an unreactive malig-
nant EEG pattern (burst suppression, status epilepticus)
after rewarming, and the presence of diffuse ischaemic
injury on brain CT within 24 h after ROSC or on brain
MRI at 2–5 days after ROSC. Combining at least two of
these predictors is suggested.
If none of these criteria is present or if the results
from prognostic tests are discordant, the prognosis is
indeterminate and prolonged observation and treatment
is continued so that late awakeners can be identified. In
15–30% of patients with an eventually good outcome,
awakening may occur between 48 h and 10–12 days
after discontinuing sedation [72, 73]. Patients with renal
insufficiency, older age, or post-resuscitation shock have
an increased risk of delayed awakening [72]. The presence
of predictors of neurological recovery (see earlier) should
also be considered in this context. In patients with
prolonged unconsciousness (2–4 weeks after ROSC),
advanced MRI techniques—whole-brain white matter frac-
tional anisotropy (WWM-FA) measured using diffusion
tensor imaging [74]—may predict poor neurological out-
come more accurately than conventional MRI.
Multimodality
Almost all prognostication studies have a low or very
low quality of evidence, the main reason being the risk
of self-fulfilling prophecy (SFP). This bias occurs when
the treating team is not blinded to the results of the
prognostic index under investigation and use it to decide
on WLST. Among 73 studies included in a review pub-
lished in 2014 [12], only nine (12%)—three of which
were from the same group—addressed SFP by blinding,
and only 37 (51%) reported the criteria for WLST. Given
the relatively small sample size of most prognostication
studies and the risk of SFP, even the most robust
predictors cannot predict outcome with absolute cer-
tainty, and for this reason a multimodal approach is rec-
ommended. The algorithm suggested in the current
ERC–ESICM guidelines [13] is per se multimodal, since
it adds the results of clinical examination to those of
electrophysiology, biomarkers, or imaging. However, this
approach is based on expert opinion. Future prospective
studies will be needed to confirm whether this model is
able to increase the precision of specificity without
greatly reducing sensitivity.
Conclusions
Patients who are comatose at 72 h or more after ROSC
and in whom major confounders have been excluded
should undergo prognostication, aimed to detect signs
of severe and irreversible HIBI. This can be achieved
using four main categories of tests: clinical examination,
electrophysiology, biomarkers, and neuroimaging. The
timing of these tests varies and may precede the clinical
assessment at ≥ 72 h that initiates the prognostication
process. Among prognostic tests, ocular reflexes and
somatosensory evoked potentials are considered the
most robust, while biomarkers, electroencephalography,
imaging, and status myoclonus have inconsistencies
which suggest using them only in combination. A multi-
modal approach combining multiple prognostication
tests is recommended by current guidelines so that the
risk of a falsely pessimistic prediction is minimised.
