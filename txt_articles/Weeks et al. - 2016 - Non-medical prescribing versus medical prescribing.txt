Background
A range of health workforce strategies are needed to address health service demands in low-, middle- and high-income countries.
Non-medical prescribing involves nurses, pharmacists, allied health professionals, and physician assistants substituting for doctors in a
prescribing role, and this is one approach to improve access to medicines.
Objectives
To assess clinical, patient-reported, and resource use outcomes of non-medical prescribing for managing acute and chronic health
conditions in primary and secondary care settings compared with medical prescribing (usual care).
Search methods
We searched databases including CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and five other databases on 19 July 2016. We also searched the
grey literature and handsearched bibliographies of relevant papers and publications.
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), cluster-RCTs, controlled before-and-after (CBA) studies (with at least two intervention and two
control sites) and interrupted time series analysis (with at least three observations before and after the intervention) comparing: 1. non-
medical prescribing versus medical prescribing in acute care; 2. non-medical prescribing versus medical prescribing in chronic care; 3.
non-medical prescribing versus medical prescribing in secondary care; 4 non-medical prescribing versus medical prescribing in primary
care; 5. comparisons between different non-medical prescriber groups; and 6. non-medical healthcare providers with formal prescribing
training versus those without formal prescribing training.
Data collection and analysis
We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Two review authors independently reviewed studies for inclusion,
extracted data, and assessed study quality with discrepancies resolved by discussion. Two review authors independently assessed risk of

 bias for the included studies according to EPOC criteria. We undertook meta-analyses using the fixed-effect model where studies were
examining the same treatment effect and to account for small sample sizes. We compared outcomes to a random-effects model where
clinical or statistical heterogeneity existed.
Main results
We included 46 studies (37,337 participants); non-medical prescribing was undertaken by nurses in 26 studies and pharmacists in 20
studies. In 45 studies non-medical prescribing as a component of care was compared with usual care medical prescribing. A further
study compared nurse prescribing supported by guidelines with usual nurse prescribing care. No studies were found with non-medical
prescribing being undertaken by other health professionals. The education requirement for non-medical prescribing varied with country
and location.
A meta-analysis of surrogate markers of chronic disease (systolic blood pressure, glycated haemoglobin, and low-density lipoprotein)
showed positive intervention group effects. There was a moderate-certainty of evidence for studies of blood pressure at 12 months
(mean difference (MD) -5.31 mmHg, 95% confidence interval (CI) -6.46 to -4.16; 12 studies, 4229 participants) and low-density
lipoprotein (MD -0.21, 95% CI -0.29 to -0.14; 7 studies, 1469 participants); we downgraded the certainty of evidence from high due
to considerations of serious inconsistency (considerable heterogeneity), multifaceted interventions, and variable prescribing autonomy.
A high-certainty of evidence existed for comparative studies of glycated haemoglobin management at 12 months (MD -0.62, 95% CI -
0.85 to -0.38; 6 studies, 775 participants). While there appeared little difference in medication adherence across studies, a meta-analysis
of continuous outcome data from four studies showed an effect favouring patient adherence in the non-medical prescribing group (MD
0.15, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.30; 4 studies, 700 participants). We downgraded the certainty of evidence for adherence to moderate due to
the serious risk of performance bias. While little difference was seen in patient-related adverse events between treatment groups, we
downgraded the certainty of evidence to low due to indirectness, as the range of adverse events may not be related to the intervention
and selective reporting failed to adequately report adverse events in many studies.
Patients were generally satisfied with non-medical prescriber care (14 studies, 7514 participants). We downgraded the certainty of
evidence from high to moderate due to indirectness, in that satisfaction with the prescribing component of care was only addressed in
one study, and there was variability of satisfaction measures with little use of validated tools. A meta-analysis of health-related quality
of life scores (SF-12 and SF-36) found a difference favouring usual care for the physical component score (MD 1.17, 95% CI 0.16 to
2.17), but not the mental component score (MD 0.58, 95% CI -0.40 to 1.55). However, the quality of life measurement may more
appropriately reflect composite care rather than the prescribing component of care, and for this reason we downgraded the certainty of
evidence to moderate due to indirectness of the measure of effect. A wide variety of resource use measures were reported across studies
with little difference between groups for hospitalisations, emergency department visits, and outpatient visits. In the majority of studies
reporting medication use, non-medical prescribers prescribed more drugs, intensified drug doses, and used a greater variety of drugs
compared to usual care medical prescribers.
The risk of bias across studies was generally low for selection bias (random sequence generation), detection bias (blinding of outcome
assessment), attrition bias (incomplete outcome data), and reporting bias (selective reporting). There was an unclear risk of selection
bias (allocation concealment) and for other biases. A high risk of performance bias (blinding of participants and personnel) existed.
Authors’ conclusions
The findings suggest that non-medical prescribers, practising with varying but high levels of prescribing autonomy, in a range of
settings, were as effective as usual care medical prescribers. Non-medical prescribers can deliver comparable outcomes for systolic blood
pressure, glycated haemoglobin, low-density lipoprotein, medication adherence, patient satisfaction, and health-related quality of life.
It was difficult to determine the impact of non-medical prescribing compared to medical prescribing for adverse events and resource use
outcomes due to the inconsistency and variability in reporting across studies. Future efforts should be directed towards more rigorous
studies that can clearly identify the clinical, patient-reported, resource use, and economic outcomes of non-medical prescribing, in both
high-income and low-income countries.

Prescribing roles for health professionals other than doctors
What is the aim of this review?

Non-medical prescribing versus medical prescribing for acute and chronic disease management in primary and secondary care (Review)
Copyright © 2016 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
 The aim of this Cochrane review was to find out if prescribing by health professionals other than doctors delivers comparable outcomes
to prescribing by doctors. Cochrane researchers collected and analysed all relevant studies to answer this question and found 46 studies.
Key messages
With appropriate training and support, nurses and pharmacists are able to prescribe medicines as part of managing a range of conditions
to achieve comparable health management outcomes to doctors. The majority of studies focus on chronic disease management in
higher-income counties where there is generally a moderate-certainty of evidence supporting similar outcomes for the markers of disease
in high blood pressure, diabetes, and high cholesterol. Further high-quality studies are needed in poorer countries and to better quantify
differences in prescribing outcomes for adverse events, and to determine health economic outcomes. Further studies could also focus
more specifically on the prescribing component of care.
What was studied in the review?
A number of countries allow health professionals other than doctors to prescribe medicines. This shift in roles is thought to provide
improved and timely access to medicines for consumers where there are shortages of doctors or the health system is facing pressures
in coping with the burden of disease. In addition, this task shift has been supported by a number of governments as a way to more
appropriately use the skills of health professionals, such as nurses and pharmacists, in the care of patients. We compared the outcomes
of any healthcare workers who were prescribing with a high degree of autonomy with medical prescribers in the hospital or community
setting in low-, middle- and high-income countries.
What are the main results of the review?
This review found 45 studies where nurses and pharmacists with high levels of prescribing autonomy were compared with usual care
medical prescribers. A further study compared nurse prescribing with guideline support with usual nurse prescribing care. No studies
were found with other health professionals or lay prescribers. Four nurse prescribing studies were undertaken in the low- and middle-
income settings of Colombia, South Africa, Uganda, and Thailand. The remainder of studies were undertaken in high-income Western
countries. Forty-two studies were based in a community setting, two studies were located in hospitals, one study in the workplace, and
one study in an aged care facility. Prescribing was but one part of many health-related interventions, particularly in the management
of chronic disease.
The review found that the outcomes for non-medical prescribers were comparable to medical prescribers for: high blood pressure
(moderate-certainty of evidence); diabetes control (high-certainty of evidence); high cholesterol (moderate-certainty of evidence);
adverse events (low-certainty of evidence); patients adhering to their medication regimens (moderate-certainty of evidence); patient
satisfaction with care (moderate-certainty of evidence); and health-related quality of life (moderate-certainty of evidence).
Pharmacists and nurses with varying levels of undergraduate, postgraduate, and specific on-the-job training related to the disease or
condition were able to deliver comparable prescribing outcomes to doctors. Non-medical prescribers frequently had medical support
available to facilitate a collaborative practice model.
How up-to-date is this review?
The review authors searched for studies that had been published up to 19th July 2016.

 *The basis for the assumed risk (e.g. the median control group risk across studies) is provided in footnotes. The corresponding risk (and its 95% CI) is based on the assumed
risk in the comparison group and the relative effect of the intervention (and its 95% CI).
CI: confidence interval; GP: general practitioner; MD: mean difference; RCT: randomised controlled trial.
GRADE Working Group grades of evidence
High-certainty: Further research is very unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect.
Moderate-certainty: Further research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate.
Low-certainty: Further research is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and is likely to change the estimate.
Very low-certainty: We are very uncertain about the estimate.
1Downgraded one level due to serious inconsistency (considerable heterogeneity was found).
2Multifaceted interventions.
3Variable prescribing autonomy.
4Downgraded one level due to serious risk of bias (high risk of performance bias).
5Variable reporting measures of adherence.
6Downgraded one level due to indirectness (range of adverse events; may not be related to the intervention).
7Downgraded one level due to selective outcome reporting (adverse events not reported in many studies).
8Downgraded one level due to indirectness (prescribing component not adequately assessed across studies).
9Variability in satisfaction measures.

Non-medical prescribing versus medical prescribing for acute and chronic disease management in primary and secondary care (Review)

Description of the healthcare challenge
A range of health workforce strategies are needed to address issues
of health service access and efficiency. In low-, middle- and high-
income countries, the increasing demand for health services arises
from an ageing population and the resultant increasing burden of
chronic disease (Bhanbhro 2011; Duckett 2005; Phillips 2008;
WHO 2012).
Increased health demands can be met in part by task substitution
within the health workforce. One health workforce strategy for
task substitution is to permit prescribing by healthcare providers
other than medical doctors. Non-medical prescribers may include
nurses, pharmacists, allied health professionals, and physician as-
sistants. In some low- and middle-income countries, lay health
workers have been used to distribute medications with preventive
or curative intent, including contraceptives, iron or vitamin sup-
plements, vaccinations, and agents for tuberculosis management
(Glenton 2013).
Extending a health provider’s scope of practice, including the right
to prescribe, has been supported in a number of countries as a
means of benefiting patient care by the effective use of health pro-
fessionals’ skills, improving patient access to timely care, improv-
ing patient choice, and enhancing teamwork and the better use of
resources (Department of Health 1999; Ellis 2006; Hooker 2006;
Stewart 2010).
The devolution of prescribing rights in high-income countries has
continued from a historical base in the United States of America
(USA) in the 1970s through to more recent government-led re-
forms in the United Kingdom (UK), Canada, the Netherlands,
New Zealand, and Australia. While the definition of prescribing
may vary between countries, for the purpose of our review, pre-
scribing was defined as: “an iterative process involving the steps
of information gathering, clinical decision making, communica-
tion and evaluation which results in the initiation, continuation or
cessation of a medicine” (Health Workforce Australia 2013). The
term ’medical prescribing’ refers to prescribing by medically qual-
ified doctors. The supply of non-prescription (over-the-counter)
medicines by pharmacists or pharmacy assistants working in com-
munity pharmacies is excluded from our definition of prescribing,
as is the supply of medicines by lay health workers.
The term ’non-medical prescribing’ originates from the UK,
where it is defined as: “prescribing by specially trained nurses, op-
tometrists, pharmacists, physiotherapists, podiatrists, and radiog-
raphers, working within their clinical competence as either inde-
pendent or supplementary prescribers” (NPC 2012).
Supplementary prescribing which was introduced in the UK in
2003, is defined as ’a voluntary partnership between an indepen-
dent prescriber (a doctor or dentist) and a supplementary pre-
scriber (e.g. nurse, optometrist, pharmacist, physiotherapist, chi-
ropodist/podiatrist, or radiographer) to implement an agreed pa-
tient-specific clinical management plan with the patient’s agree-
ment’ (Department of Health 2003). Non-medical prescribing
rights were extended in 2006 with the introduction of indepen-
dent prescribing. The UK Department of Health defines inde-
pendent prescribing as ’prescribing by a practitioner (e.g. doctor,
dentist, nurse, pharmacist, optometrist) responsible and account-
able for the assessment of patients with undiagnosed or diagnosed
conditions, and for decisions about the clinical management re-
quired, including prescribing’. Independent prescribing is one el-
ement of the clinical management of a patient and occurs in part-
nership with the patient. It requires an initial patient assessment,
interpretation of that assessment, a decision on safe and appro-
priate therapy, and a process for ongoing monitoring. The inde-
pendent prescriber is responsible and accountable for at least this
element of a patient’s care (Department of Health 2006). Inde-
pendent prescribing does not require a clinical management plan.
From 1 May 2006, nurse and pharmacist independent prescribers
who completed the appropriate training could prescribe, with a
few exceptions, any licensed medicine for any medical condition
within their competence. In 2009, independent prescribing rights
were extended to include unlicensed medicines. While prescrib-
ing of controlled drugs was restricted, this limitation was removed
through legislative change in April 2012 (Home Office 2012).
In the USA, devolution of prescribing authority varies from state
to state. Collaborative Practice Agreements in 46 States allow a
pharmacist to partner with a physician to manage a number of
patient services, including medication management (Law 2013;
Thomas 2006). Physician assistants and nurse practitioners were
introduced in 1967 to support medical care. These practitioners
undertake a range of clinical functions, including prescribing (
Hooker 2006).
Within Canada, a pharmacist’s scope of prescribing practice varies
between the provinces from independently prescribing to adapting
(modifying) or continuing prescriptions (Law 2012).
A collaborative prescribing model has emerged as the preferred
model of practice within New Zealand and Australia. Collabora-
tive prescribing is undertaken within a multidisciplinary team and
can include the continuum of prescribing from transcription of
orders (with or without medical signature), prescribing specified
drugs and doses by protocol, prescribing by clinical management
plan (allowing choice of drugs and doses) to independent prescrib-
ing, where a prescribing consultation with a medical practitioner
is not required (Weeks 2008; Wheeler 2012).
The Health Professionals Prescribing Pathway developed by
Health Workforce Australia (HWA) includes five steps to safely
and competently prescribe, and covers: education and training,
recognition by the profession’s national registering board, autho-
risation to prescribe by legislation, prescribing within the scope
of practice, and maintaining and enhancing competence to pre-
scribe. The prescribing models suggested by HWA emphasise team
communication and are divided into autonomous prescribing,
prescribing under supervision, and prescribing via a structured
7

 prescribing arrangement (HWA 2013). The reforms started by
HWA have been transferred to a working group of the Australian
Health Practitioner Regulation Agency. As part of the reform pro-
cess, health agencies in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the
UK have developed prescribing competency frameworks for non-
medical health professionals (NPC 2012; NPS 2012; Pharmacy
Council NZ 2013; Yuksel 2008).
Description of the intervention
For the purpose of our review the term ’non-medical prescrib-
ing’ was used to cover prescribing of medicines by a broad range
of healthcare providers other than medical doctors, prescribing
in primary or secondary care. No limitation was set on the type
of non-medical healthcare provider undertaking prescribing. Fre-
quently, non-medical prescribing is done in collaboration or part-
nership with doctors, and within this practice there are different
models of prescribing practice. However, for this review the non-
medical prescriber was required to have a high degree of auton-
omy in their prescribing practice. We excluded studies reporting
prescribing practices requiring medical review, consultation, and
approval requiring a medical signature on medication orders. Our
review focused on prescribing, which as per our definition is much
broader than issuing a prescription.
The role of non-medical prescribers in secondary care settings
may involve supporting acute or chronic care by prescribing in a
timely way medication on admission, discharge, or where there
is a specialist need, e.g. total parenteral nutrition. Specialist out-
patient clinics managed by non-medical health professionals may
exist in either the primary or secondary care setting, e.g. for the
management of hypertension, lipids, diabetes, and pain. In pri-
mary care settings, prescribing may be undertaken for acute or
chronic conditions by nurses or other healthcare providers caring
for patients in their homes or through involvement with general
practice teams, community health centres, mental health teams,
or community pharmacies.
How the intervention might work
Non-medical prescribing has developed as an accepted healthcare
practice in a number of countries to improve access to healthcare,
to better use the skills of doctors who can focus on more acute pa-
tient needs, to better use the skills of pharmacists, nurses and other
health providers, to potentially reduce costs for achieving at least
equivalent, if not better health outcomes for consumers, and to
retain health workers by increasing job satisfaction (Department
of Health 1999; Tonna 2007). While qualitative studies support
non-medical prescribing from a patient and practitioner perspec-
tive, robust evidence is still required for clinical, patient-reported,
and resource use outcomes. It is noted that where non-medical
prescribers are practising in collaborative teams, it may be diffi-
cult to apportion the impact of the non-medical prescribing com-
ponent to the primary and secondary outcomes of this review.
Wider adoption of non-medical prescribing practice in high-in-
come countries frequently faces local regulatory hurdles and op-
position from the medical community which has raised concerns
about professional autonomy, patient safety, the diagnostic com-
petency of non-medical prescribers, and costs (Cooper 2008). Evi-
dence that patient outcomes arising from non-medical prescribing
are as effective as those from medical prescribing would provide a
basis for policy-makers to support wider implementation of this
practice.
Why it is important to do this review
It is important for health practitioners and policy-makers to un-
derstand the evidence existing for non-medical prescribing in or-
der to address access or health workforce needs. This information
will also guide future decision making with regards to implement-
ing or expanding non-medical prescribing.
Potential beneficiaries of the findings include:
1. policy-makers seeking to use workforce resources more
efficiently;
2. policy-makers seeking to meet a clinical need;
3. consumers seeking greater choice and easier access to
medicines;
4. non-medical health professionals seeking to better utilise
their skills and/or extend their scope of practice; and
5. medical staff seeking to focus on patients with the greatest
medical need.
Despite a gradual rolling out of reforms, the evidence for the po-
tential benefits of non-medical prescribing from well-controlled
trials involving a wide range of health professionals requires iden-
tification, synthesis, and evaluation. Several narrative reviews of
the non-medical prescribing literature have been undertaken (Kay
2004; Tonna 2007), and the British government commissioned
two evaluations covering supplementary and independent pre-
scribing (Bissell 2008; Latter 2010).
A Cochrane Review on substitution of doctors by suitably trained
nurses in primary care found that trained nurses can produce as
high a quality of care and as good health outcomes with no appre-
ciable difference between doctors and nurses in resource utilisation
outcomes associated with prescribing (Laurant 2005). The review
was limited to nurses in the primary care setting as first contact or
ongoing care for undifferentiated patients.
A further Cochrane Review found a single RCT of pharmacist-
managed drug therapy (Nkansah 2010), including the prescrib-
ing of drugs versus physician medication management (Hawkins
1979). However, we assessed the study to be of low-quality, leav-
ing open the question of whether the delivery of patient-targeted
services by pharmacists improves patient outcomes compared to
other health professionals.

Non-medical prescribing versus medical prescribing for acute and chronic disease management in primary and secondary care (Review)

 The Driscoll 2015 Cochrane Review of nurse-led titration of drug
therapy for people with heart failure, found that participants in
the nurse-led group were less likely to be admitted to hospital or
to die. More participants reached the maximum drug dose in the
nurse-ledtitrationgroupcomparedtotitration of dosesbyprimary
care physicians. The certainty of evidence that nurse-led titration
reduced hospitalisations was graded as high and the certainty of
evidence regarding the proportion of participants reaching opti-
mal dose was graded as low. However, in the majority of studies
the influence of medical supervision on nurse-dose titration (pre-
scribing) was unclear.
Against this background, we systematically identified, reviewed,
and updated the evidence from controlled studies and uncon-
trolled studies on the clinical, patient-reported and resource use
outcomes of non-medical prescribing in primary and secondary
care settings. This review considered any adverse effects of non-
medical prescribing which may be clinical (e.g. deterioration in
care or incidence of adverse drugs reactions), patient-reported (e.g.
decreased satisfaction), or resource-related (e.g. increased treat-
ment costs).
The review covered healthcare providers undertaking non-medical
prescribing, spanning primary and secondary care settings, and
considered acute and chronic prescribing situations.

Criteria for considering studies for this review
Types of studies
We included studies of patients or health professionals or health-
care settings using the definitions of designs outlined in the
Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care (EPOC)
Group checklist (Cochrane EPOC Group 2013a). We included
randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and cluster-RCTs, one con-
trolled trial where investigators had allocated participants to the
different groups that were being compared using a method that
is not random, but where at least two groups with interventions
were followed, and one controlled before-and-after (CBA) study
with at least two intervention sites and two control sites. We did
not find either interrupted time series (ITS) studies nor qualita-
tive studies linked to quantitative studies using qualitative analysis
methods.
Types of participants
Healthcare providers who are not medical doctors, undertaking
prescribing including, nurses, optometrists, pharmacists, physi-
cian assistants, and other allied health professionals or categories
not specifically mentioned whose roles meet our definition of non-
medical prescribing.
Setting
We included studies based in any primary or secondary care setting
where non-medical prescribing occurred.
Types of interventions
We included studies involving health providers other than medical
doctors undertaking prescribing according to our definition of
prescribing. We excluded studies limited to the supply function
of pharmacists, including over-the-counter products and studies
involving the supply function of lay health workers.
We included the following six comparisons for non-medical pre-
scribing.
1. Non-medical prescribing versus medical prescribing in
acute care.
2. Non-medical prescribing versus medical prescribing in
chronic care.
3. Non-medical prescribing versus medical prescribing in
secondary care.
4. Non-medical prescribing versus medical prescribing in
primary care.
5. Comparisons between different non-medical prescriber
groups.
6. Non-medical healthcare providers with formal prescribing
training versus those without formal prescribing training.
Types of outcome measures
The studies included in the review reported a wide variety of out-
come measures. We only included studies with objective measures
of patient clinical outcomes. Non-inferiority was regarded as a
positive outcome where a non-medical prescribing outcome was
at least as good as the comparator. We excluded studies with only
a qualitative component in order to maintain the clinical focus of
the review.

 Patient outcomes
We used standard outcome measures covering health and well-be-
ing, including physiological measures of treatment such as systolic
blood pressure, glycated haemoglobin, and low-density lipopro-
tein. Outcomes were divided into dichotomous and continuous
outcomes.
We also considered the following outcomes.
1. Proportion of prescribers, medical and non-medical,
appropriately adhering to practice guidelines.
2. Proportion of patients demonstrating medication
adherence.
3. Proportion of patients and items appropriately prescribed
or deprescribed.
4. Patient satisfaction, where measured by a validated tool as
part of an effectiveness study.
5. Non-medical prescriber versus medical prescriber waiting
time to care.
6. Non-medical prescribers adversely affecting the health
outcomes of patients through medication errors, prescribing
errors, adverse events, wrong diagnoses or treatment, increased
hospitalisations, or representations for medical care.
Secondary outcomes
Patient-reported outcomes
We considered patient-reported outcomes without clinician inter-
pretation of their knowledge requirements, daily functioning, and
health-related quality of life.
Non-medical prescriber outcomes
Where present, we also reported non-medical prescriber outcomes
of jobsatisfaction, skillsutilisation, education needs,and workload
effects.
Resource use outcomes
1. Medical time saved by non-medical prescribers.
2. Non-medical prescriber versus medical prescriber
prescription volume and cost, patient out-of-pocket expenses,
service costs, and deprescribing rate and cost.
3. Increased resource use for providing the intervention and
for providing subsequent care such as hospitalisations,
emergency department visits, and outpatient visits.
Search methods for identification of studies

The MEDLINE search strategy as illustrated in Appendix 1 was
developed by the Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of
Care (EPOC) Group Information Specialist in consultation with
the authors. We translated it for other databases using appropri-
ate syntax and vocabulary for those databases. We employed the
Cochrane Highly Sensitive Search Strategy (sensitivity- and pre-
cision-maximizing version, 2008 revision) to identify randomised
trials, and the Cochrane EPOC Group methodology filter to iden-
tify non-randomised studies. We managed search results using
reference management software and removed duplicates before
screening was undertaken. We also searched the Cochrane Database
of Systematic Reviews (CDSR) and the Database of Abstracts of
Reviews of Effects (DARE) for related systematic reviews.

unpublished results or data.
4. We contacted researchers with expertise relevant to the
review topic/EPOC interventions.
5. We conducted cited reference searches for all included
studies in citations indices.
Data collection and analysis
Selection of studies
We merged the search results through the use of a reference man-
agement software and removed duplicate records. Two review au-
thors (GW, JG) then independently assessed the titles and ab-
stracts of the search results to evaluate their potential eligibility,
and discussed the relevance of articles to the topic. The two review
authors were not responsible for the selection of studies they were
involved in or associated with. Neutral members of the review
team were responsible for assessing the eligibility of each study for
inclusion in the review. We retrieved the full-text of all remaining
relevant papers and the two review authors assessed these full-text
articles independently, based on the review’s inclusion criteria.
We included a ’Characteristics of excluded studies’ table in the
review. This table included studies that appear to meet the inclu-
sion criteria but were eventually excluded, and we reported the
reasons for exclusion (e.g. not a RCT, only one intervention and/
or control site for a CBA study, absence of non-medical prescriber
autonomy). If there was uncertainty or disagreement, consensus
was reached by discussion with other review authors. We corre-
sponded with authors of included studies if necessary to obtain
further information in order to assess compliance with eligibility
and confirm data. Within the review, we mapped the flow of infor-
mation of identified, included, and excluded studies by depicting
them in a PRISMA flow diagram (Moher 2009) (Figure 1).

 Data extraction and management
We adaptedastandarddataextractionform basedon the Cochrane
EPOC Group’s data collection checklist (Cochrane EPOC Group
2013a). We designed and assessed the form to suitably extract
data on the characteristics of each study, including study design,
study participants, the interventions and comparators, outcomes
and follow-up periods, funding source, and interest declarations.
Four review authors (GW, JG, DS, KM) independently extracted
study characteristics and the outcome data outlined above. We
checked the data against each other. If there was uncertainty or
disagreement, we reached consensus by discussion or in the pres-
ence of an adjudicating third review author, if necessary. We con-
tacted study authors to obtain any missing information. If a study
was reported in more than one publication, we extracted the data
from all publications into separate data collection forms before
combining them.
Assessment of risk of bias in included studies
Two review authors (GW, JG) independently assessed the risk
of bias of included studies, with any disagreements resolved by
consensus with a third review author (KM). We used the Cochrane
EPOC Group nine-point criteria for RCTs, non-RCTs, and CBA
studies (Cochrane EPOC Group 2015).
1. Allocation sequence generation.
2. Allocation concealment.
3. Baseline outcome measurements.
4. Baseline characteristics.
5. Incomplete outcome data.
6. Knowledge of allocated interventions.
7. Protection against contamination.
8. Selective outcome reporting.
9. Other risks of bias.
We did not find any ITS studies, but we will assess future studies
using the seven standard Cochrane EPOC Group criteria for ITS
studies (Cochrane EPOC Group 2015).
1. Intervention independent of other changes.
2. Prespecified effect shape.
3. Intervention unlikely to affect data collection.
4. Blinding.
5. Incomplete outcome data.
6. Selective outcome reporting.
7. Other bias.
We rated each component and categorised it in a ’Risk of bias’
table as ’low risk’, ’unclear risk’, or ’high risk’, as described in the
Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Higgins
2011). We documented for each included study a summary as-
sessment of the risk of bias.
Measures of treatment effect
We recorded and reported measures of effect in the same way
investigators reported them. We performed all analyses using
Cochrane’s statistical software, Review Manager 5 (RevMan
2014), and recorded data in the form of a table included in
the Cochrane EPOC Group’s data extraction template (Cochrane
EPOCGroup2013b). Forcontinuousvariables,we reportedmean
differences (MDs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) between
the intervention and comparison groups. We used a standard-
ised mean difference (SMD) with 95% CI for the same continu-
ous variable measured with different scales. For dichotomous out-
comes, we calculated the risk difference (RD) with 95% CI. We
planned to calculate the risk ratio (RR), again with 95% CI.
Unit of analysis issues
We assessed whether an appropriate adjustment had been made
for clustering in RCTs and CBA studies to avoid unit of analysis
errors. If there were insufficient data for re-analysis, we attempted
to correct such errors by contacting study authors to obtain ad-
ditional data. Determining the intracluster correlation coefficient
from additional data or like studies allows adjustment of clustering
by inflating the standard error. Where re-analysis was not possible
we reported the point estimate without a standard error or CI and
the P value was annotated ’re-analysed’.
Dealing with missing data
We applied the ’Risk of bias’ criteria to exclude studies with a
high risk of missing data, as they pose serious threats to validity
(Higgins 2011). Where appropriate, we contacted study authors
for further information. If this was not possible, we reported the
number of participants lost to follow-up. Imputing missing data
was only considered when continuous outcomes were reported
without measures of variance. We followed the principles of in-
tention-to-treat analysis as far as possible.
Assessment of heterogeneity
We found that the range of healthcare settings, differing non-med-
ical prescribers, differing clinical conditions being managed, and
variation in study designs lead to clinical, methodological, and
statistical heterogeneity. Assessment of these differences informed
the analysis and determined whether results could be statistically
combined in a meta-analysis. The review team made this decision
on a consensus basis. We assessed statistical heterogeneity by using
the Chi2 test to assess if differences in results are compatible with
chance alone using P < 0.10. We quantified statistical heterogene-
ity using the I2 statistic, as appropriate. We determined that het-
erogeneity might not be important between 0% and 40%, 30% to
13

Copyright © 2016 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
 60% represented moderate heterogeneity, 50% to 90% substan-
tial heterogeneity, and 75% to 100% considerable heterogeneity
(Higgins 2011).
Assessment of reporting biases
We assessed the risk of publication bias based on the information
in the ’Risk of bias’ tables and constructed funnel plots for the
outcomes of systolic blood pressure and low-density lipoprotein.
Data synthesis
We used a structured synthesis approach to analyses. After consid-
eration of the small-study effects of many included studies we used
a fixed-effect model for meta-analysis and compared outcomes
with a random-effects model. For quantitative synthesis we used
Review Manager 5 for statistical analysis (RevMan 2014). Where
we could not combine data for a meta-analysis due to inconsis-
tency of reporting measures, or when it was not applicable to use
the average effect across studies of an intervention, we reported
in this plain language summaries as appropriate. We included key
data elements such as explanatory factors, results, effects, and cer-
tainty of evidence in a table for each category of interventions.
Summary of findings
We used a ’Summary of findings’ table and GRADEpro GDT soft-
ware to record results, outcomes, and outcome risks in our struc-
tured synthesis (GRADEpro GDT 2014). In addition, we used
the five GRADE study considerations (study limitations, consis-
tency of effort, imprecision, indirectness, and publication bias) to
assess the certainty of the body of evidence and summarise our
confidence in the effects of the interventions by outcome across
studies (Atkins 2004). We included the following outcomes in the
’Summary of findings’ table: systolic blood pressure, glycated hae-
moglobin, low-density lipoprotein, medication adherence, patient
satisfaction, adverse events, and health-related quality of life. We
justified all decisions to down- or upgrade the certainty of evi-
dence using footnotes, and we made comments to aid the reader’s
understanding of the review where necessary.
Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity
Differences in healthcare settings, non-medical prescriber types,
clinical conditions being managed, and study designs informed
the assessments of methodological and statistical heterogeneity.
Explanatory variables or effect modifiers which may have influ-
enced the size of intervention effects included the level of pre-
scriber education, study location, patient condition being treated,
and adherence to therapy and practice guidelines. The degree of
non-medical prescribing autonomy within and across subgroups
may have explained differences in outcomes and limited the ap-
plicability of findings.
For consistency across studies, we presented data as subgroups for
the clinical outcomes of systolic blood pressure, glycated haemo-
globin, and low-density lipoprotein at six and 12 months. We pre-
sented quality of life measures (SF-36 and SF-12) as subgroups of
physical component and mental component scores.
In considering the type of intervention, we did not undertake
a meta-analysis comparing algorithm prescribing to more au-
tonomous prescribing on clinical outcomes due to considerable
heterogeneity.
There were insufficient studies to compare outcomes from differ-
ent non-medical prescriber settings e.g. secondary care versus pri-
mary care.
Variability in education standards made it difficult to compare
non-medical prescriber subgroups.
Sensitivity analysis
We undertook a sensitivity analysis comparing meta-analyses out-
comes using fixed-effect and random-effects analyses for the three
clinical surrogate markers of disease: systolic blood pressure; gly-
cated haemoglobin; and low-density lipoprotein (Table 1). The
effect modifier of clustering in RCTs on systolic blood pressure
at six months was tested by removing these trials from the meta-
analysis (Margolis 2013 at six months; Khunti 2007 and Margolis
2013 at 12 months; Analysis 1.2; Analysis 1.3). We did not un-
dertake a sensitivity analysis excluding unclear or high risk of bias
studies due to the similar risk of bias elements existing within the
outcome categories.

Results of the search
The database search yielded 13,220 titles. We found 51 addi-
tional studies through handsearching. After removing duplicates,
we screened 9335 studies and reviewed 162 full-text articles. We
excluded 112 studies that did not meet the inclusion criteria
and recorded our reasons for exclusion. We included 46 studies
(37,337 participants). Of these, 44 were randomised controlled
trials (RCTs), including six cluster-RCTs (Fairall 2008; Heisler
2012; Khunti 2007; Margolis 2013; Moher 2001; Pagaiya 2005),
one controlled trial (Denver 2003), and one controlled before-
and-after (CBA) study (Thompson 1984). Three studies are await-

 one study is ongoing (Mikuls 2015). Refer to Figure 1 for PRISMA
diagram.
Included studies
Non-medical prescribing studies were included where the health
professional (other than a medical practitioner) undertook a high
level of autonomous prescribing. This included medication initi-
ation, dosage change, or cessation of medication (with or without
guidance from established protocols and guidelines).
Participants
Non-medical prescribing versus medical prescribing was practised
by nurses in 26 studies with 28,621 participants (Ansari 2003;
Aubert 1998; Barr Taylor 2003; Becker 2005; DeBusk 1994;
Denver 2003; Einhorn 1978; Fairall 2008; Fischer 2012; Hill
2003; Houweling 2009; Houweling 2011; Ishani 2011; Khunti
2007; Klingberg-Allvin 2015; Kuethe 2011; Litaker 2003; Logan
1979; MacMahon Tone 2009; Moher 2001; New 2003; Pagaiya
2005; Rudd 2004; Spitzer 1974; Tobe 2006; Wallymahmed
2011), and by pharmacists in 20 studies with 8716 participants
(Bruhn 2013; Chenella 1983; Choe 2005; Cohen 2011; Ellis
2000; Finley 2003; Heisler 2012; Hirsch 2014; Hunt 2008; Jaber
1996; Magid 2013; Margolis 2013; Marotti 2011; McAlister
2014; Taveira 2010; Taveira 2011; Thompson 1984; Tsuyuki
2015; Tsuyuki 2016; Vivian 2002).
The health professionals delivering the interventions were phar-
macists or nurses with varying degrees of formal or informal train-
ing. We did not find any studies where other non-medical health
professionals, such as physician assistants undertook prescribing
roles. Nurse prescribing was undertaken in the majority of studies
by reference to algorithms. While nurses exercised independence
in prescribing by algorithm, physicians were usually available for
consultation for issues beyond the scope of the algorithm, or for
more complex cases or for periodic review.
Pharmacist prescribing was generally undertaken in a more au-
tonomous way, with more reliance on clinical judgement and
guidelines rather than restrictive algorithms. This broader practice
scope was supported through collaborative practice agreements in
the USA and independent or supplementary prescribing in the
UK. In addition to their defined prescribing autonomy, non-med-
ical prescribers in several studies had limits placed on additional
prescribing, and required medical prescribing or approval for dose
acceleration (Tobe 2006), management of conditions outside the
focus of care (Finley 2003; Litaker 2003; New 2003; Taveira 2011;
Vivian 2002), and initiation of new drugs (Barr Taylor 2003;
DeBusk 1994; New 2003; Rudd 2004).
Excluding the cluster-RCTs, nine studies had less than 100 pa-
tients, seven studies had more than 100 and less than 200 pa-
tients, 16 studies had more than 200 and less than 500 patients,
five studies had between 500 to 800 patients, and three studies
included over 1000 patients. There were six cluster-RCTs: Fairall
2008, 31 clinics, cohort one 9252 patients, cohort two 6231 pa-
tients; Heisler 2012, 16 primary care teams at five medical cen-
tres, 4100 patients; Khunti 2007, 20 primary care practices, 1316
patients; Margolis 2013, 16 primary care clinics, 450 patients;
Moher 2001, 21 general practices, 1906 patients; Pagaiya 2005,
18 nurse-led health centres, 3960 patients.
Setting
Four nurse prescribing studies (14,921 participants) were un-
dertaken in low- and middle-income settings within Colombia,
South Africa, Uganda, and Thailand (Einhorn 1978; Fairall 2008;
Klingberg-Allvin 2015; Pagaiya 2005). The remainder of studies
were undertaken in the high-income countries, of Australia (1),
Canada (6), Ireland (1), Netherlands (3), UK (6), and USA (25).
Forty-two studies were based in ambulatory care settings, includ-
ing primary care clinics, medical centres, general practices, com-
munity pharmacies, and hospital outpatient clinics. Two studies
were located in secondary care settings (Chenella 1983; Marotti
2011). One study was set in the workplace (Logan 1979), and one
in an aged care setting (Thompson 1984).
Interventions
Pharmacist and nurse interventions were often multifaceted, with
prescribing being one element of a complex management ap-
proach. For example, in diabetes care, patient education, self-care,
diet, exercise, and follow-up were factors influencing outcomes, as
well as the prescribing of medications.
Outcomes
The majority of studies involved the management of one or more
chronic diseases (heart failure, hypertension, diabetes, dyslipi-
daemias) and risk factors for disease recurrence such as stroke
(McAlister 2014), and acute myocardial infarction or heart fail-
ure (DeBusk 1994; Khunti 2007). Studies outside of these areas
included the management of chronic pain (Bruhn 2013), fam-
ily planning (Einhorn 1978), HIV treatment (Fairall 2008), in-
complete abortion (Klingberg-Allvin 2015), depression (Finley
2003), and asthma in children, which was the only paediatric study
(Kuethe 2011).
Non-medical clinician collaborative care approaches with physi-
cians (Litaker 2003), or community health workers (Becker 2005;
Hill 2003), and interventions with telemonitoring (Magid 2013;
Margolis 2013), added to the complexity of determining specific
non-medical prescribing outcomes.
The following 21 studies had a more direct relationship between
non-medical prescribing and the outcome markers of the disease
or condition: Ansari 2003 (heart failure); Bruhn 2013 (chronic

 pain); Chenella 1983 (anticoagulation); Denver 2003 (blood pres-
sure); Fairall 2008 (HIV medications); Hirsch 2014 (blood pres-
sure); Houweling 2009 and Houweling 2011 (glycaemia, blood
pressure, lipids); Hunt 2008 (blood pressure); Ishani 2011 (gly-
caemia, blood pressure, lipids); Jaber 1996 (glycaemia, blood pres-
sure, lipids); Klingberg-Allvin 2015 (incomplete abortion); Logan
1979 (blood pressure); MacMahon Tone 2009 (glycaemia, blood
pressure, lipids); McAlister 2014 (blood pressure, lipids); Marotti
2011 (regular medications); Thompson 1984 (medications in the
geriatric setting); Tsuyuki 2015 (blood pressure); Tsuyuki 2016
(glycaemia, blood pressure, lipids); Vivian 2002 (blood pressure);
and Wallymahmed 2011 (glycaemia, blood pressure, lipids).
Excluded studies
We excluded studies if the study design did not meet the EPOC
criteria for a RCT, controlled clinical trial, CBA or ITS. We ex-
cluded studies where we judged that the non-medical health pro-
fessional did not have a significant degree of autonomy in their
prescribing practice, and prescribing required medical review, con-
sultation, or authorisation.
Risk of bias in included studies
The risk of bias assessment for included studies is presented in the
’Risk of bias’ tables, under each study in the section Characteristics
of included studies. The risk of bias results are presented in a
graphical form in Figure 2.

 Allocation
Thirty-three of 46 studies (72%) adequately described the random
sequence generation and we considered them to be at low risk of
bias. Allocation concealment was undertaken in 13 studies (28%),
unclear in 31 studies (67%) and with no concealment in two
studies (Margolis 2013; Thompson 1984).
Blinding
Blinding of both participants and personnel could not be achieved
through the study design in 44 of the 46 included studies. In the
Chenella 1983 study it was unclear whether patients would be
aware that the pharmacist had undertaken anticoagulation dose
determinations, and in the Pagaiya 2005 study, whether the inter-
vention group nurses had undertaken additional training and were
using guidelines. Objective clinical outcomes in studies requiring
laboratorymeasuressuch asglycatedhaemoglobinandlow-density
lipoprotein were coded as blinded outcome assessment. In seven
studies, blinded assessment of blood pressure was undertaken (Hill
2003; Hunt 2008; Logan 1979; Magid 2013; McAlister 2014;
Moher 2001; Rudd 2004). Where blood pressure assessment was
not clear or undertaken by study investigators, we judged this to
be an unclear outcome assessment. Ansari 2003 used an indepen-
dent research assistant to assess β-blocker use in heart failure.
Incomplete outcome data
Loss to follow-up of 20% or more in either the intervention or con-
trol armsoccurredin14studies(Aubert 1998; Becker2005; Bruhn
2013; Choe 2005; Einhorn 1978; Finley 2003; Heisler 2012;
Hirsch 2014; Hunt 2008; Ishani 2011; Jaber 1996; McAlister
2014; Moher 2001; New 2003).
Selective reporting
The funnel plots of systolic blood pressure revealed a degree of
asymmetry, demonstrating a possible publication bias from an
absence of published negative intervention studies. The funnel
plot of low-density lipoprotein studies was asymmetrical, with
heterogeneity a consideration.
Other potential sources of bias
The majority of studies had a degree of confounding either by the
multifactorial intervention (which made it difficult to distinguish
the influence of non-medical prescribing on outcomes) or by un-
clear prescribing autonomy or medical influence. The six cluster-
RCTs appropriately accounted for the cluster design.
Effects of interventions
See: Summary of findings for the main comparison Non-
medical prescribing compared to medical prescribing for acute and
chronic disease management in primary and secondary care
See: Summary of findings for the main comparison for the main
comparisons; systolic blood pressure, glycated haemoglobin, low-
density lipoprotein, adherence, adverse events, patient satisfaction,
and quality of life.
We had planned to analyse the six comparisons listed in the Types
of interventions section, however we only found studies for the
following two comparisons: non-medical prescribing in acute care
(secondary care); and non-medical prescribing in chronic care (pri-
mary/ambulatory care).
Non-medical prescribing in acute care (secondary
care)
Primary Outcomes
Studies involving non-medical prescribing interventions were of-
ten characterised by degrees of confounding, including the pres-
ence of multiple interventions, patient comorbidities, study dura-
tion, differing levels of non-medical prescriber training, and un-
clear influences from medical prescribers. However, while recog-
nising these complexities and limitations, care involving non-med-
ical prescribers resulted in improvements or similar effectiveness
to usual care for a range of clinical outcomes and surrogate disease
markers.
We found two studies (438 participants) where non-medical pre-
scribing was practised in an acute/secondary care setting (Chenella
1983; Marotti 2011).

 4. Proportion of prescribers, medical and non-medical,
appropriately adhering to practice guidelines
Pharmacist prescribers adjusted anticoagulant therapy, as well as
an experienced physician, in the independent management of an-
ticoagulation therapy for inpatients. There were no significant dif-
ferences between groups for mean heparin and warfarin doses, par-
tial thromboplastin time, days to reach therapeutic levels, or mean
prescribed and simulated heparin doses (Chenella 1983; Table 2).
5. Proportion of patients demonstrating medication adherence
Outcome not reported.
6. Proportion of patients and items appropriately prescribed
or deprescribed
Preoperative medication history taking and prescribing by a phar-
macist improved the accuracy of medication documentation and
significantly reduced missed doses of regular medication for elec-
tive surgical patients. The marginal mean number of missed doses
per patient was 3.21 (95% confidence interval (CI) 2.89 to 3.52)
in the control group, which was significantly reduced in the phar-
macist prescribing group 1.07 (95% CI 0.90 to 1.25; P = 0.002)
(Marotti 2011; Table 2).
7. Patient satisfaction, where measured by a validated tool as
part of an effectiveness study
Outcome not reported.
8. Non-medical prescriber versus medical prescriber waiting
time to care
Outcome not reported.
9. Non-medical prescribers adversely affecting the health
outcomes of patients through medication errors, prescribing
errors, adverse events, wrong diagnoses or treatment,
increased hospitalisations, or representations for medical care
Chenella 1983 reported no patients had major bleeding but four
patients in the pharmacist prescriber group had minor bleeding
(one patient had a bleeding facial laceration on admission but
a normal prothrombin time). One patient in the physician pre-
scriber group died, after receiving heparin and warfarin for a stroke
in evolution, but there was no evidence of bleeding.
Secondary Outcomes
Patient-reported outcomes
1. Health-related quality of life
Outcome not reported.
Non-medical prescriber outcomes
1. Job satisfaction, skills utilisation, education needs, and
workload effects
Outcome not reported.
Resource-use outcomes
1. Medical time saved by non-medical prescribers
Outcome not reported.
2. Non-medical prescriber versus medical prescriber
prescription volume and cost, patient out-of-pocket expenses,
service costs, deprescribing rate, and cost
There was little or no difference in amount of anticoagulant drugs
prescribed by pharmacists compared to a physician (Chenella
1983; Table 2).
3. Increased resource use for providing the intervention and
for providing subsequent care such as hospitalisations,
emergency department visits, and outpatient visits.
Outcome not reported.
Non-medical prescribing in chronic care
(primary/ambulatory care)
We included 40 studies in this comparison. We included am-
bulatory care clinics for chronic disease management located
with secondary care hospitals in this subgroup (Denver 2003;
Houweling 2009; Jaber 1996; Kuethe 2011; MacMahon Tone
2009; McAlister 2014; New 2003). Two studies were under-
taken in the community pharmacy setting (Tsuyuki 2015; Tsuyuki
2016,).

 Meta-analyses were undertaken for systolic blood pressure, gly-
catedhaemoglobin,andlow-densitylipoproteinusing the fixed-ef-
fect method for outcomes at six and 12 months (Figure 3; Figure 4;
Figure 5). These studies were skewed toward either nurse or phar-
macist prescribers, namely, systolic blood pressure at six months
(3 nurse studies, 8 pharmacist studies), systolic blood pressure at
12 months (10 nurse studies, 2 pharmacist studies), glycated hae-
moglobin at six months (1 nurse study, 2 pharmacist studies) gly-
cated haemoglobin at 12 months (6 nurse studies, 0 pharmacist
studies), low-density lipoprotein at six months (4 nurse studies,
2 pharmacist studies), low-density lipoprotein at 12 months (7
nurse studies, 0 pharmacist studies).

 component showed improvement in three surrogate markers of
disease; systolic blood pressure, glycated haemoglobin, and low-
density lipoprotein.
A single study compared pharmacist case management versus the
active control of nurse-led case management and feedback to pri-
mary care physicians for medication adjustment in the secondary
prevention after minor stroke (McAlister 2014). Improvements in
both systolic blood pressure and low-density lipoprotein guide-
line targets were observed in both the pharmacist group (43.4%)
and nurse-led group (30.9%) after six months (absolute difference
12.5%, P = 0.03). Multivariable analyses confirmed the greater
attainment of targets in the pharmacist group (adjusted odds ratio
(OR) 2.31, 95% CI 1.29 to 4.2; P = 0.005, adjusted for age, co-
morbidities, sex, smoking status, and waist circumference). Both
groups had similar reductions in systolic blood pressure during the
trial and the overall result was driven by a higher proportion of pa-
tients meeting low-density lipoprotein targets in the pharmacist-
led group versus the nurse-led group (51.1% versus 33.8%, P =
0.003).
Primary Outcomes
1. Systolic blood pressure
Eleven ambulatory care studies (2076 participants) reporting sys-
tolic blood pressure at six months showed a mean difference (MD)
favouring the non-medical prescribing group compared to usual
care of -6.76 mmHg (95% CI -8.24 to -5.27; Analysis 1.1), but
there was considerable heterogeneity (I2 = 82%, overall effect P <
0.00001) (Cohen 2011; Denver 2003; Hirsch 2014; Houweling
2009; Magid 2013; Margolis 2013; McAlister 2014; Rudd 2004;
Taveira 2011; Tsuyuki 2015; Vivian 2002). At 12 months, 12 am-
bulatory care studies (4229 participants) showed a MD favour-
ing the non-medical prescribing group of -5.31 mmHg (95% CI
-6.46 to -4.16; Analysis 1.1) with moderate heterogeneity (I2 =
50%, overall effect P < 0.00001) (Aubert 1998; Barr Taylor 2003;
Becker 2005; Hill 2003; Houweling 2009; Hunt 2008; Khunti
2007; MacMahon Tone 2009; Margolis 2013; New 2003; Tobe
2006; Wallymahmed 2011). The test for subgroup differences was
not significant (I2 = 56.3%, P= 0.13) (Figure 3).
The systolic blood pressure effect estimate at six months for the
fixed-effect model was MD -6.76 mmHg, 95% CI -8.24 to -
5.27 compared to the random-effects estimate (MD -7.34 mmHg,
95% CI -11.09 to -3.60). At 12 months the respective compari-
son was MD -5.31 mmHg, 95% CI -6.46 to -4.16 versus MD -
5.91 mmHg, 95% CI -7.71 to -4.10 (Table 1). There was a mod-
erate-certainty of evidence (Summary of findings for the main
comparison).
Excluding the cluster-RCT at six months (Margolis 2013), the
effect estimate was MD -6.13 mmHg, 95% CI -7.83 to -4.44; 10
studies, 1628 participants (Analysis 1.1.3). Excluding the cluster-
RCTs at 12 months (Khunti 2007; Margolis 2013), the effect
estimate wasMD-4.84mmHg,95%CI-6.29 to -3.39; 10 studies,
2627 participants (Analysis 1.1.4).
The subgroup analysis of four studies (695 participants) where
non-medical prescribers demonstrated a higher level of prescrib-
ing autonomy in the control of systolic blood pressure showed:
fixed-effect MD -2.98 mmHg, 95% CI -5.36 to -0.59; P = 0.01,
compared with a random-effects model MD -6.78 mmHg, 95%
CI -15.38 to 1.81; P = 0.12, with considerable heterogeneity I2 =
90% (Analysis 1.1.5; Figure 3).
2. Glycated haemoglobin
For glycated haemoglobin, three ambulatory care studies at six
months demonstrated a MD favouring the non-medical prescrib-
ing group of -0.42% (95% CI -0.75 to -0.09; 271 participants;
Analysis 1.2) with moderate heterogeneity (I2 = 44%, overall effect
P < 0.01) (Cohen 2011; Houweling 2009; Taveira 2011). At 12
months, six ambulatory care studies managing glycated haemoglo-
bin showed a MD favouring the non-medical prescribing group of
-0.62% (95% CI -0.85 to -0.38; 775 participants) with minimal
heterogeneity (I2 = 0%, overall effect P < 0.00001; Analysis 1.2)
(Aubert 1998; Barr Taylor 2003; Houweling 2009; Litaker 2003;
MacMahon Tone 2009; Wallymahmed 2011). The test for sub-
group differences was not significant (I2 = 0%, P = 0.35; Figure
4). For fixed-effect versus random-effects estimates refer to Table
1. There was a high-certainty of evidence (Summary of findings
for the main comparison; Table 1).
3. Low-density lipoprotein
Six ambulatory care studies (1213 participants) for low-density
lipoprotein management at six months showed a MD favouring
the non-medical prescribing group of -0.25 mmol/L (95% CI -
0.34to-0.17), butthese studiesdemonstratedconsiderable hetero-
geneity (I2 = 88%, overall effect P < 0.00001; Analysis 1.3) (Cohen
2011; DeBusk 1994; Hirsch 2014; Houweling 2009; McAlister
2014; Taveira 2011). At 12 months the MD favouring the non-
medical prescribing group in seven ambulatory care studies was
-0.21 mmol/L (95% CI -0.29 to -0.14; 7 studies, 1469 partici-
pants; Analysis 1.3). The studies demonstrated considerable het-
erogeneity (I2 = 93%; overall effect P < 0.00001) (Aubert 1998;
Barr Taylor 2003; Becker 2005; DeBusk 1994; Houweling 2009;
MacMahon Tone 2009; Wallymahmed 2011). The test for sub-
group differences was not significant (I2 = 0%, P = 0.53; Figure 5).
There was moderate-certainty of evidence (Summary of findings
for the main comparison; Table 1).
Further exploration of the high heterogeneity in the six-month
low-density lipoprotein study was undertaken by examining the
differences in pharmacist and nurse prescribing. It was found that
heterogeneity might not be important in the four pharmacist stud-
ies (629 participants) (MD -0.09, 95% CI -0.20 to 0.02; I2= 0%;
23

 Analysis 1.4), which did not yield a significantly different over-
all effect (P = 0.1). Considerable heterogeneity existed in the two
nursing studies (584 participants) (MD -0.52, 95% CI -0.67 to
-0.38; I2 = 94%; Analysis 1.4), with a significant overall effect
(P < 0.00001). The test for overall effect for both subgroups had
considerable heterogeneity and was significant (I2 = 88%, P <
0.00001). The subgroup differences showed very high heterogene-
ity and were significant (I2 = 95.6%, P < 0.00001). For fixed-effect
versus random-effects estimates refer to Table 1.
4. Proportion of prescribers, medical and non-medical,
appropriately adhering to practice guidelines
Adherence to practice guidelines was difficult to quantify across
studies. Intervention group prescribing was usually aimed at treat-
ing a target based on approved therapeutic guidelines. Usual care
prescribing may have been based on supplied guidelines, educa-
tion, or an assumed knowledge of current guidelines.
5. Proportion of patients demonstrating medication
adherence (Analysis 1.5 and 1.6)
Medication adherence was assessed in 10 studies using a number of
approaches including Morisky Medication Adherence Scale, med-
ication possession ratio, patient report, pill count, electronic drug
event monitoring, and pharmacy medication refill information
(Table 3). Medication adherence was reported as high in interven-
tion and usual care groups across studies. There was probably little
ornodifference betweengroupsinsixstudies (Bruhn 2013; Cohen
2011; Finley 2003; Hunt 2008; Magid 2013; Vivian 2002), and
an improved outcome favouring the intervention group in two
studies (Logan 1979; Rudd 2004). The study by Margolis 2013
found an improved outcome favouring the intervention group
at six months, but no difference between groups at 12 and 18
months. Medication adherence outcomes could not be assessed in
the study by Hirsch 2014.
A meta-analysis was undertaken for four studies (Cohen 2011;
Finley 2003; Magid 2013; Rudd 2004), with adherence data cap-
tured as continuous variables with an outcome probably favouring
the intervention group, standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.15
(95% CI 0.00 to 0.30; 700 participants, overall effect P = 0.05)
and moderate heterogeneity I² = 38% (Analysis 1.5). Four studies
(935 participants) with dichotomous adherence data (Hunt 2008;
Logan 1979; Margolis 2013; Vivian 2002), showed little adher-
ence difference (risk difference (RD) 0.06, 95% CI -0.00 to 0.12;
P = 0.05) and moderate heterogeneity I2 = 67% (Analysis 1.6).
There was a moderate-certainty of evidence (Summary of findings
for the main comparison; Table 1).
6. Proportion of patients and items appropriately prescribed
or deprescribed
In the aged care setting the pharmacist prescribed 2.2 fewer drugs
per patient than medical colleagues, comparing before-and-after
study periods (Thompson 1984). Tsuyuki 2015 reported com-
munity pharmacist prescribers discontinued 76 antihypertensive
drugs in 181 intervention group patients compared to 15 antihy-
pertensive drugs being discontinued in 67 usual care group pa-
tients.
7. Patient satisfaction, where measured by a validated tool as
part of an effectiveness study
Patient satisfaction was reported in 14 studies (7514 participants)
(Table 4). Validated tools assessing the overall satisfaction with
care were included in six studies, namely, diabetes care (Houweling
2009; Houweling 2011), hypertension care (Hunt 2008), clinical
pharmacist care (Hirsch 2014), and general care (Litaker 2003;
Margolis 2013). The majority of satisfaction surveys were not ref-
erenced or were locally developed. Some aspects important in the
prescribingprocesswere coveredinoverall satisfactionassessments,
e.g. the quantity and quality of contact (Finley 2003; Houweling
2011; Margolis 2013). The locally developed satisfaction survey
by Bruhn 2013 focused on the prescribing intervention. Patients
were generally positive about the pharmacist prescribing service,
85% (39/46) were totally satisfied, while 9% (4/44) would have
preferred to see their general practitioner (GP). Overall, there was
a moderate-certainty of evidence (Summary of findings for the
main comparison; Table 1). Studies looking at medical provider
satisfaction with non-medical prescribers were limited in number
and scope (Barr Taylor 2003; Bruhn 2013), but generally positive.
8. Non-medical prescriber versus medical prescriber waiting
time to care
Outcome not reported.
9. Non-medical prescribers adversely affecting the health
outcomes of patients through medication errors, prescribing
errors, adverse effects, wrong diagnoses or treatment,
increased hospitalisations, or representations for medical care
Adverse events were reported in 18 of the 46 studies (18,400 par-
ticipants) (Table 5). There was probably little or no difference in
adverse events between the intervention and usual care groups in
nine studies (Ansari 2003; Aubert 1998; Fairall 2008; Ishani 2011;
Klingberg-Allvin 2015; Kuethe 2011; Spitzer 1974; Taveira 2011;
Tobe 2006), with a probable increase in adverse events in the usual
care group in two studies (New 2003; Thompson 1984). We are
uncertain whether the intervention has an effect on adverse events
24

 in the remaining studies due to limited data reporting. The rela-
tionship between increased medication use in intervention groups
and adverse events remains uncertain. Overall, there was a low-
certainty of evidence between the intervention and adverse events
(Summary of findings for the main comparison; Table 1).
10. Other surrogate outcome markers
Studies of surrogate outcome markers not included in the meta-
analyses reported either probable improvements favouring the in-
tervention over usual care (Choe 2005; Ellis 2000; Fischer 2012;
Logan 1979); little difference in outcome (Houweling 2011;
Moher 2001); or uncertainty of outcome, with surrogate markers
showing a combination of probable improvements or little differ-
ence in outcomes (Heisler 2012; Ishani 2011; Taveira 2010; Table
2).
Secondary outcomes
Patient-reported outcomes
1. Health-related quality of life
Quality of life measures reflected general non-medical prescriber
care compared to usual care. We combined physical and mental
component scores for the Short Form-12 (SF-12) and Short Form-
36 (SF-36) in a meta-analysis. Eight studies (2385 participants)
were included in the physical component meta-analysis (Bruhn
2013; Cohen 2011; Houweling 2011; Hunt 2008; Khunti 2007;
Litaker 2003; Margolis 2013; Vivian 2002); six studies (2246
participants) contributed to the mental component meta-analy-
sis (Cohen 2011; Houweling 2011; Hunt 2008; Khunti 2007;
Litaker 2003; Margolis 2013). The physical subgroups showed a
small effect (MD 1.17, 95% CI 0.16 to 2.17, P = 0.02) favouring
intervention, with low heterogeneity, I² = 17% (Analysis 1.7). The
mental component subgroup did not show an effect difference (P
= 0.25) with a MD of 0.58 (95% CI -0.40 to 1.55) with moderate
heterogeneity, I² = 66% (Analysis 1.7). There was no significant
difference between the subgroups (P = 0.41) where heterogeneity
might not be a factor, I2 = 0%.
Across studies, various quality of life measures generally demon-
strated little difference between intervention and control groups
(Table 6). There was a moderate-certainty of evidence (Summary
of findings for the main comparison; Table 1).
Non-medical prescriber outcomes
1. Job satisfaction, skills utilisation, education needs, and
workload effects
Outcome not reported.
Resource use outcomes
1. Medical time saved by non-medical prescribers
Outcome not reported.
2. Non-medical prescriber versus medical prescriber
prescription volume and cost, patient out-of-pocket expenses,
service costs, deprescribing rate, and cost
Medication use, including medication amount, medication type,
medication dosing, medication frequency, and medication cost
was higher in 14 non-medical prescribing groups (7092 par-
ticipants) compared to usual care (Ansari 2003; Cohen 2011;
Denver 2003; Heisler 2012; Houweling 2009; Hunt 2008; Logan
1979; MacMahon Tone 2009; Magid 2013; Margolis 2013; Rudd
2004; Taveira 2010; Taveira 2011; Tsuyuki 2015). Little difference
in medication use was reported in two studies (Chenella 1983;
Vivian 2002) (137 participants), and a variable outcome was re-
ported in six studies (7924 participants) (Einhorn 1978; Hirsch
2014; McAlister 2014; Moher 2001; Pagaiya 2005; Wallymahmed
2011). (Table 7).
Costs relating to prescription volume, patient out-of-pocket ex-
penses, and deprescribing rate were not reported.
3. Increased resource use for providing the intervention and
for providing subsequent care such as hospitalisations,
emergency department visits, and outpatient visits
Twenty-five studies (22,590 participants) reported resource use,
including hospital admissions, emergency department visits, out-
patient visits, primary care visits, physician visits, pharmacists’ vis-
its, examinations, and staff and laboratory costs (Table 7). Due to
the heterogeneity of resource use across studies and the measures
used to record resource use, meta-analysis was confined to a limited
number of studies of emergency department visits (RD 0.01, 95%
CI -0.02 to 0.03) and hospitalisation (RD -0.01, 95% CI -0.03
to 0.01) comparing the non-medical prescribing group to usual
care. There was no statistical difference between study groups for
these parameters (P = 0.52 and P = 0.51, respectively) in the meta-
analysis (Analysis 1.8). There appeared to be little difference in
25

 hospitalisations, emergency department visits, and outpatient vis-
its between intervention versus control groups across the studies.
Non-medical prescribing in other settings
Two studies were undertaken in other settings. Logan 1979 de-
scribedastudyof bloodpressure control bynursesinthe workplace
compared to usual medical care. Patients in the nurse group were
more likely to be put on antihypertensive medications (94.7%
versus 62.7%, P < 0.001), to reach blood pressure goals in the first
six months (48.5 versus 27.5%, P < 0.001) and to take drugs pre-
scribed (67.6 versus 49.1%, P < 0.005). Thompson 1984 reported
on pharmacist prescribing in a geriatric setting. The clinical phar-
macist group probably had a lower number of deaths (P = 0.05), a
higher number of patients being discharged to lower levels of care
(P = 0.03) and a lower average number of drugs per patient (P =
0.04) (Table 2).
Four studies were undertaken in low- and middle-income country
settings. Einhorn 1978 evaluated nurse management versus usual
doctor care of family planning and prescribing oral contraceptives.
While differences in patient management occurred, the outcomes
of continuing oral contraceptive use and preventing pregnancy
were probably not different. As outlined, Fairall 2008 evaluated
task shifting of antiretroviral therapy from doctors to primary care
nurses. The intervention improved survival slightly in patients not
yet taking antiretrovirals with CD4 counts of 201 to 350 cells
per µL but resulted in little difference in patients with higher cell
counts. There was little or no difference in viral load suppression
between patient groups for patients already taking antiretrovirals
at enrolment. Klingberg-Allvin 2015 compared treatment of in-
complete abortion with misoprostol by physicians and midwives
at district level in Uganda and found the diagnosis and treatment
of incomplete abortion by midwives equally safe and effective as
when provided by physicians. In the study by Pagaiya 2005, educa-
tional intervention with guidelines for nurses probably improved
antibiotic prescribing for acute respiratory tract infections and the
prescribing of diazepam. There was probably no difference in the
prescribing of antibiotics for diarrhoea, and it is uncertain whether
diabetes care improved because the certainty of evidence is low.

Summary of main results
The overall findings suggest that non-medical prescribing prac-
tised with varying but high degrees of autonomy and with collab-
orative support, can deliver comparable outcomes to usual med-
ical care prescribing. However, these results must be interpreted
with a degree of caution, recognising the variation in non-medical
prescribing practice reported within studies and the complex in-
terplay of factors affecting outcomes. There are a limited number
of well-designed randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating
the specific prescribing outcomes of non-medical prescribers.
Meta-analyses examining surrogate markers of disease with the
fixed-effect method demonstrated interventions with a non-med-
ical prescribing component decreased systolic blood pressure at six
months by -6.76 mmHg, and at 12 months by -5.31 mmHg. The
fixed-effect estimates gave a more conservative estimate of effect
than the random-effects estimate for systolic blood pressure ( -
7.34 mmHg and -5.91 mmHg, respectively). There was little dif-
ference between fixed- and random-effects outcomes for glycated
haemoglobin at six months (-0.42% versus -0.45%, respectively)
and at 12 months (-0.62% versus -0.62%, respectively). Reduc-
tions in low-density lipoprotein demonstrated variable results us-
ing fixed- and random-effects at six months (-0.25 mmol/L ver-
sus -0.13 mmol/L, respectively), and 12 months (-0.21 mmol/
L versus -0.30 mmol/L, respectively). However, all studies apart
from those assessing glycated haemoglobin at 12 months demon-
strated moderate to considerable heterogeneity. Removal of the
two cluster-RCTs for systolic blood pressure reduced the fixed-
effect difference by 0.63 mmHg at six months and 0.47 mmHg
at 12 months.
Clinical findings of interventions with non-medical prescribing
components outside the meta-analyses showed equivalence or ben-
efit compared to usual care (Table 2). Medication adherence was
measured in less than a quarter (22%) of studies. Where adher-
ence was measured, there was either no difference between study
groups or a small improvement in intervention groups. More reg-
ular contact by the non-medical prescriber with intervention pa-
tients compared to usual care may be a confounding factor. For ex-
ample, in the telemonitoring of blood pressure study by Margolis
2013, which demonstrated improved medication adherence at six
months, there was regular telephone support from the interven-
tion pharmacist every two weeks until blood pressure control was
sustained for six weeks. Contact then reduced to monthly contact
for six months which may account for little or no difference in
medication adherence at 12 and 18 months. A meta-analysis of
four studies with continuous adherence data favoured the non-
medical prescriber group with minimal heterogeneity.
In studies reporting adverse events, there was either little differ-
ence between intervention and usual care groups or insufficient
information to determine if differences occurred. In two studies,
more deaths were reported in the usual care group versus the in-
tervention group (New 2003; Thompson 1984).
The meta-analysis of the combined quality of life measures (SF-12
and SF-36 scores at 12 months) showed an overall improvement
favouring the intervention. A variety of other quality of life mea-
sures (used in the remaining studies and not included in the meta-
analysis) generally demonstrated little difference between the in-
tervention and usual care groups. In assessing quality of life ef-
fects, consideration must be given to the effect of the multifaceted
nature of many interventions beyond the non-medical prescribing
component.

Non-medical prescribing versus medical prescribing for acute and chronic disease management in primary and secondary care (Review)

 Patient satisfaction data were reported in 14/46 (30%) of studies
and focused on the care patients received from the non-medical
health professional as a whole, with little specific comparative ev-
idence of satisfaction with the prescribing element of care. Bruhn
2013 obtained a high patient satisfaction rating of 85% (39/46)
with the pharmacist service involving prescribing and education in
the management of chronic pain. Two studies included results of
small samples of medical provider satisfaction with non-medical
providers, which were generally positive, but they raised respec-
tive concerns about time commitments to intervention patients
and the cost-effectiveness of non-medical prescribers (Barr Taylor
2003; Bruhn 2013).
A wide variety of measures of resource use were reported in 37/46
(80%) of studies. In the majority of studies reporting medication
use, non-medical prescribers initiated and prescribed more drugs,
titrated drugs to a higher dose, and used a greater variety of drugs
than usual care medical prescribers in treating chronic disease. In
the aged care setting, the pharmacist prescribed fewer drugs than
medical colleagues (Thompson 1984). There was little difference
in hospitalisations, emergency department visits, and outpatient
visits between intervention versus usual care groups across the
studies.
Non-medical prescribers had varying levels of prescriber training,
determined by country or setting, and no studies were found com-
paring different levels of non-medical prescriber training and out-
comes.
Overall completeness and applicability of
evidence
The majority of studies were from high-income countries with
the greater proportion, 25 of 46 studies emanating from the USA.
While the results of this review are more applicable in West-
ern countries, the four studies involving non-medical prescribing
nurses in low- and middle-income countries demonstrated safe
and effective outcomes compared to usual care, and provide an
opportunity for further study in the application of non-medical
prescribing. It is unclear why more studies meeting inclusion cri-
teria did not originate from the UK where legislative change and
formal training requirements have allowed independent prescrib-
ing by nurses and pharmacists since 2006. Chronic disease man-
agement was the focus of most studies with only two studies un-
dertaken in the acute inpatient secondary care setting (Chenella
1983; Marotti 2011).
No studies reported comparisons between non-medical prescribers
in both arms of the study.
In only 19 studies could a more defined non-medical prescribing
role with less confounding elements provide a clearer effect on
outcomes. Pharmacists were judged to have more autonomy in
their prescribing roles than nurses, who relied more heavily on al-
gorithms to adjust medications. The degree of prescribing auton-
omy within study designs was guided by local legislative controls
and healthcare organisation policies and practices.
Formal training as a requirement to prescribe was limited. Inde-
pendent pharmacist prescribers in the Bruhn 2013 UK study were
required to complete a course of approved study and have regis-
tration with the General Pharmaceutical Council as independent
prescribers. In Alberta Canada, pharmacists in the Tsuyuki studies
were required to undergo an assessment process when applying for
the authorisation to prescribe (Tsuyuki 2015; Tsuyuki 2016). In
other studies, prescribing permissions were granted through col-
laborative practice agreements for pharmacists in the USA, and
varying degrees of specific on-the-job training for the disease or
condition of focus. Prescribers frequently had advanced practice
qualifications, for example, in diabetes management, and a num-
ber of years of experience in ambulatory chronic disease care. Pre-
scribing of oral contraceptives was within the remit of family plan-
ning nurses in Bogota, Colombia (Einhorn 1978). Local training
was provided to nurses in South Africa covering antiretroviral drug
prescribing, drug effects and side-effects, and the use of algorith-
micclinical practice guidelines(Fairall 2008). MidwivesinUganda
underwent a five-day training programme covering incomplete
abortionandtreatmentwith misoprostol (Klingberg-Allvin2015).
Nurses in health centres in Thailand prescribed antibiotics for
children and diazepam for adults without additional education
and guideline support, which was the focus of the study (Pagaiya
2005).
The heterogeneity of educational requirements for non-medical
prescribers across studies did not allow a pooled assessment of
outcomes, but within individual studies the education level did
not appear to influence the outcome.
Local trial protocols,which includedadditional collaborative med-
ical support for the non-medical prescriber, were aimed at ensur-
ing safe practice.
Most excluded studies were before-and-after studies and there re-
mains a need for further large, well-controlled trials, where the
prescribing component can be clearly associated with an outcome,
and the degree of prescribing autonomy is clearly defined.
Mikuls 2015 is an ongoing study (see Characteristics of ongoing
studies). We are waiting for further information from one study
that is reported as an abstract (Tsuyuki 2014). We have placed
this study in Characteristics of studies awaiting classification and
we will incorporate this study in a future review update. Two fur-
ther studies, assessing economic impacts, are awaiting assessment
(Barton 2013; Neilson 2015). We made the pragmatic decision
that these two studies will be incorporated in the update of this
review, so as to avoid delaying the publication of the current ver-
sion of this review.
Quality of the evidence
We evaluated the certainty of the body of evidence for seven out-
comes according to the GRADE system.
27
Non-medical prescribing versus medical prescribing for acute and chronic disease management in primary and secondary care (Review)
Copyright © 2016 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
 We graded the certainty of evidence for systolic blood pressure
at 12 months as moderate due to considerations of serious in-
consistency (finding considerable heterogeneity), the multifaceted
nature of interventions, and variable prescribing autonomy. We
found high levels of certainty of evidence for the outcome of gly-
cated haemoglobin at 12 months. There were low levels of cer-
tainty of evidence for low-density lipoprotein due to serious in-
consistency (finding considerable heterogeneity), multifaceted in-
terventions, and variable prescribing autonomy. We graded medi-
cation adherence at moderate-certainty of evidence due to serious
risk of bias (high risk of performance bias) and variable adherence
reporting measures. We graded the certainty of evidence around
adverse event reporting as low due to indirectness, as the range of
adverse events may not be related to the intervention, and selective
outcome reporting with adverse events not being reported in many
studies. We graded the certainty of evidence for patient satisfac-
tion as moderate due to indirectness in measuring the prescribing
component of care, the variability of measures used, and the con-
sideration that some measures were not validated. We graded the
health-related quality of life measures as moderate, considering
that within the quality of life outcomes it is difficult to distinguish
the contribution non-medical prescribing made to the outcome
versus the other components of care.
The certainty of the body of evidence provides support that there
is probably no difference in outcomes between non-medical and
medical prescribers. Specific outcomes may be improved by non-
medical prescribers working within collaborative care arrange-
ments in a range of settings.
Potential biases in the review process
Differing terminologies for non-medical prescribing across coun-
tries may have limited the number of studies found. In addition,
we made judgements on the degree of prescribing autonomy for
non-medical prescribers in included studies.
Agreements and disagreements with other
studies or reviews
The findings of this review are generally consistent with the find-
ings of other reviews. Meta-analyses of studies involving phar-
macist and nurse-led care may include studies involving medica-
tion management, medication reconciliation, medication educa-
tion, treatment monitoring, treatment support, and lifestyle ad-
vice. Medication management is a broad term that may or may not
include a prescribing component. Subgroup analysis of studies in-
volving either independent prescribing, prescribing or dosage ad-
justment by protocol or algorithm have demonstrated benefit over
usual care. Findings of improvements in clinical markers and het-
erogeneity accord with our findings. In a meta-analysis, Santschi
2014 reported pharmacist interventions improved blood pressure
compared to usual care, but due to the large heterogeneity be-
tween studies the effect size varied widely, and it was difficult to
determine the most effective intervention. A range of pharmacist
interventions were found to reduce systolic blood pressure, but
possibly not diastolic blood pressure (Machado 2007). A limita-
tion for both studies was the quality of the studies included in the
analyses. In a systematic review of the effects of nurse prescribing,
Gielen 2014 reviewed 35 studies including 10 RCTs and one con-
trolled clinical trial. All but five studies had a high risk of bias, but
tentative conclusions were that nurses prescribed in a similar way
to doctors with few differences in health outcomes, quality of care,
and patient satisfaction. Clark 2010 found nurse-led interventions
required an algorithm to improve blood pressure control com-
pared to usual care, and there was some evidence of improved out-
comes by nurse prescribers outside the UK. In reviewing 72 RCTs
of interventions to control blood pressure in patients with hyper-
tension, Glynn 2010 included 12 studies of nurse-led or pharma-
cist-led care to improve blood pressure control. While the results
were significantly heterogeneous, the effects were favourable and
warranted further investigation in larger trials. The Hypertension
Detection and Follow-Up study was cited for providing evidence
of the importance of a multifaceted intervention in blood pressure
control, which consisted of an organised system of regular review
and vigorous antihypertensive drug therapy (Hypertension 1979).
In chronic disease management, nurses successfully titrated med-
ications by protocol for diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipi-
daemia within a team approach.There were limited descriptions
of the interventions and protocols used for studies in the meta-
analysis (Shaw 2014). Greer 2016 found pharmacist-led chronic
disease management was similar to usual care for resource use, and
may improve goals for glycaemia, blood pressure, and cholesterol,
but there is uncertainty whether clinical outcomes are improved.
In a review of the effects of pharmacist-provided non-dispensing
services on patient outcomes, health service utilisation, and costs
in low- and middle-income countries, Pande 2013 reported on the
outcomes of pharmacist interventions that involved counselling,
education, and advice. There were small improvements in clinical
outcomes (blood pressure, blood glucose, lipids, peak expiratory
flow) and quality of life scores, however, the certainty of the evi-
dence was graded as low. Health service utilisation and medication
costs were reduced, but again the certainty of the evidence was
graded as low. In a review of the effect of outpatient pharmacists’
non-dispensing roles on patient outcomes and prescribing pat-
terns, Nkansah 2010 found that most of the 43 studies included
in their review supported the role of pharmacists in medication/
therapeutic management as one of a number of interventions to
improve clinical outcomes.
It is often difficult to distinguish the specific outcomes of non-
medical prescribing in reported studies and reviews, and the degree
of influence on prescribing by physicians where team care arrange-
ments exist. Driscoll 2015, in a review of nurse-led titration of
drug therapy for people with heart failure, found that participants
28

 in the nurse-led group were less likely to be admitted to hospital
or to die. More participants reached the maximum drug dose in
the nurse-led group compared to titration of doses by primary care
physicians. However we assessed a high level of autonomy in pre-
scribing in only one of the seven reported studies (Ansari 2003).
In a review of substitution of doctors by nurses in primary care,
Laurant 2005 found that the quality of care and health outcomes
are similar for nurses and doctors, but it is not known if nurse
substitutiondecreasesdoctors’ workload. Nursestendedto provide
more health advice and achieve higher levels of patient satisfaction
compared to doctors. Nurses’ higher use of resources, for example,
ordering more tests, may offset savings in lower salary costs.

Implications for practice
Non-medical prescribers practising in a variety of settings and
with varying but high levels of prescribing autonomy, can achieve
comparable outcomes in the management of chronic disease and
preventive healthcare. Non-medical prescribers can deliver com-
parable outcomes for systolic blood pressure, glycated haemoglo-
bin, low-density lipoprotein, medication adherence, patient satis-
faction, and general quality of life. The certainty of evidence in
studies reporting adverse events and resource use make it difficult
to determine the impact of non-medical prescribing compared to
medical prescribing for these outcome measures. Pharmacists and
nurses are able to deliver comparable prescribing outcomes with
varying levels of undergraduate, postgraduate, and specific on-
the-job training. Non-medical prescribers frequently have med-
ical support available, if needed, and where these circumstances
exist, a collaborative approach appears the preferred model of care.
Non-medical prescribers across a range of different settings in low-
, medium- and high-income countries may be able to meet the
growing burden of chronic disease, or where doctor shortages or
scarce health resources exist.
Implications for research
It is frequently difficult within collaborative care models to dis-
tinguish specific outcomes that can be related to the non-medical
prescribing component of care. There is a need for trials to more
effectively control the variables around non-medical prescribing
to truly determine its effect compared to usual medical prescribing
care. Outcomes should be clearly defined, studies should facilitate
meta-analysis, and more effectively quantify adverse prescribing
events. Further studies on patient satisfaction using validated tools
are required to identify satisfaction with the prescribing compo-
nent of care. There were many parameters of resource use in the in-
cluded studies, with few studies capturing comparative drug costs
of non-medical prescribing versus usual care medical prescribing.
The cost of doctors’ time saved and whether this time is transferred
to more acute patient care should be quantified in future studies.
Therefore, there is a need for cost-effectiveness analysis of a range
of non-medical prescribing interventions. Well-controlled studies
are also required in the acute secondary care setting to establish
the effect of non-medical prescribing roles on medical workload,
resource use, patient flow, and safety. Due to the limited number
of studies in low- and middle-income countries, further well-con-
trolled trials are required in such settings.

Interventions
PATIENTS
The nurse reviewed the patients’ medical, lifestyle, and psychosocial status, performed
a foot examination, recorded BP
, pulse and developed a self-management plan for the
patient. Patients attended group classes (1-2 hrs) once a week for 4 weeks. Telephone
follow-up calls reviewed patient goals, medication use, symptoms, glucose monitoring,
BP monitoring, and self-management. Calls were made before the fourth group session
and at 5, 8, 12, 16, 20, 28, 36, 44 weeks. The nurses used treatment algorithms to titrate
the patients medications for diabetes, cholesterol and hypertension. The primary care
physician was called if new medication was indicated or to report any unusual findings

PATIENTS
Community-based care versus “enhanced” primary care (control) to reduce CHD risk
Patients randomised to community-based care received care from a nurse practitioner
in a non-clinical site with an exercise room. BP
, pharmacotherapy and compliance were
assessed. A community health worker provided dietary counselling, smoking cessation
and exercise counselling. Progress was reviewed by the study physician twice monthly.
Changes in pharmacotherapy were communicated to the primary care physician who
treated conditions outside the risk factors and were asked not to change risk factor
medication. Decisions on how to apply the guidelines were within the full purview
of the nurse practitioner. Prescriptions for risk factor therapy were provided free at
any pharmacy. Telephone monitoring was available. The enhanced primary care group
received the same risk specific materials and free risk factor pharmacotherapy

present. Patient education undertaken. Pharmacists could prescribe ancillary drugs e.
g. for sleep and titrate antidepressant drugs but if a change in antidepressant drug was
indicated approval from the primary care provider was required. If changes to the antide-
pressant regimen were warranted the pharmacists communicated this recommendation
to the provider. The designated psychiatric mentor met with the clinical pharmacists
each week and was available for consultation. Pharmacy care managers made follow-up
telephone calls to patients at weeks 1, 2, 4, 10, 16. Patients had clinic visits at weeks 6

Interventions
PATIENTS
A pharmacist-ledintervention(Adherence andIntensificationof Medications)in patients
with diabetes and poor BP control versus usual care
Pharmacists used electronic prescribing and clinical data systems to reach out to patients
with uncontrolled hypertension and either poor refill adherence or insufficient medica-
tion intensification in response to high BP
. Supported by up-to-date medication refill
information pharmacists delivered tailored adherence counselling by use of motivational
interviewing and medication management with follow-up once a behaviour or pharma-
cological change was made
Health professional delivering the intervention - five clinical pharmacists, two part-time
(2 full-time equivalent at KP and 2 full-time equivalent at VA). Pharmacists undertook a
3-day interactive training focusing on motivational interviewing and the study protocol,
procedures and the medication management tool (MMT). Fidelity was assessed during
the intervention. A booster session occurred six months into the intervention with feed-
back on one or more telephone encounters by an expert in motivational interviewing
Pharmacist encounters were offered at 3-month intervals (0, 3, 6, 9, 12 months)
Encounters took place at the clinic or by phone. At intake the pharmacist assessed
adherence, explored barriers to adherence, discussed BP
, HbA1c, LDL levels, explored
goals, set a short-term action step if there were barriers to adherence. If no adherence
problems the pharmacist could make BP medication changes by using site approved
algorithms
Clinical pharmacists copied the patient’s primary care physician on medication changes.
Pharmacists consulted or referred back to the primary care physician those patients
requiring more than 3 antihypertensive medications
Patients were eligible for discharge when medication adherence issues had been addressed
and target BP reached or the patient was on maximum tolerated medications

and was board certified in pharmacotherapy
Interventions
PATIENTS
Pharmacists participating in the active management of hypertension in the primary care
office according to collaborative treatment protocols versus usual care
Pharmacists reviewed the participants’ medications and lifestyle habits, assessed vital
signs, screened for adverse drug reactions, identified barriers to adherence, provided edu-
cation, optimised the antihypertensive regimen and scheduled follow-up appointments.
Antihypertensive regimen optimisation included alterations to titrate the dose of an ex-
isting medication, add a new agent, switch a medication or consolidate antihypertensive
therapy. The pharmacist had access to the patients’ medical record as well as to the pri-
mary care physician to discuss the hypertension treatment plan or other medical issues

Minnesota, USA
Patients with uncontrolled BP (≥ 140/90 mmHg or ≥ 130/80 mmHg if diabetic or
chronic kidney disease was present)
Patients 450 adults (8 clinics telephone intervention 228, 8 clinics usual care 222)
Health professional delivering intervention - 4 doctoral pharmacists with 8 hours for-
mal training on the study protocol and observed conducting a telephone visit on two
occasions. Clinical practice agreements allowed pharmacists to prescribe and change an-
tihypertensive therapy within specified parameters
Interventions
PATIENTS
Home BP telemonitoring with pharmacist case management of BP versus usual care
Patients were instructed to transmit at least 6 BP measurements weekly. During the first 6
months patients and pharmacists met every 2 weeks via telephone until BP was sustained
for 6 weeks then reduced to monthly. During intervention months 7 to 12, telephone
visits occurred every 2 months. After 12 months telemonitoring was discontinued and
patients’ care was returned to their primary care physician with no support from a study

During telephone visits pharmacists emphasised lifestyle change, and medication adher-
ence. They assessed and adjusted antihypertensive drug therapy based on an algorithm
using the percentage of home BP readings meeting goal ( ≥ 75% no change, ≤ 75%
treatment intensification). If the patient experienced adverse effects the dose would be
lowered or drugs switched. Usual care could include referral by the primary care physi-

Independent specialist nurse-led clinics (one for hypertension, one for hyperlipidaemia)
versus usual care
Patients were randomised to receive the hypertension or hypercholesterolaemiainterven-
tions separately and patients with both were randomised to one intervention and were a
control for the other
Nurses provided lifestyle advice, and titration of drug therapies according to local guide-
lines. Patients attended nurse-led clinics every 4-6 weeks until targets were achieved.
Lifestyle modifications were reinforced and medications titrated according to response.
The specialist nurse discussed patients who required additional medications with the
doctor who initiated additional therapy when appropriate. The protocol forbade the
nurse from managing the other intervention e.g. cholesterol in the BP arm

VA-MEDIC-D consisted of participants attending 4 once-weekly sessions of 2 hours
followed by 5 monthly booster 90-minute group sessions held in a classroom with 4-6
participants. Family friends could attend
Each session consisted of two parts. Part 1: Standardised education session of 40-60 min-
utes by a nurse, nutritionist, clinical pharmacist focusing on 1 or 2 self-care behaviours
e.g. goals for healthy eating
Part 2: Pharmacist conducted behavioural and pharmacologic intervention for hyper-
tension, hyperlipidaemia, hyperglycaemia and tobacco use. 60-80 minute sessions. A
group assessment of daily self-care activities was made and self-care enhanced through
group counselling. Individual risk report of laboratory tests and medication was reviewed
and drugs initiated or titrated by the pharmacist according to established algorithms for
BP
, cholesterol, diabetes and tobacco cessation. The pharmacist undertook behavioural
change goal setting. No changes were made for psychiatric medications

Barton 2013
Methods
Cost-effectiveness analysis alongside a pragmatic cluster-randomised controlled trial in 31 primary care clinics (16
intervention, 15 controls)
Participants
HIV-infectedpatientsinSouth Africa. Cohortone: patientsnotyetreceivinganti-retroviral therapy. 5390intervention
patients, 3862 controls. Cohort 2: patients receiving at least six months antiretroviral therapy; 3029 intervention
patients, 3202 controls
Interventions
Nurses who received at least four educational outreach training sessions about antiretroviral therapy prescribing and
undertook initiation and represcribing of antiretroviral therapy versus usual medical care
Outcomes
A cost-effectiveness study of nurse-led versus doctor-led antiretroviral treatment in South Africa was undertaken on
data derived from Fairall 2008. Nurse-led antiretroviral therapy was found to be associated with higher mean health
service costs than doctor-led care but the levels of uncertainty were high given the wide confidence intervals around
the incremental costs and effects. There may have also been an underestimation of the benefit of the intervention.
The increased costs were largely explained by more frequent clinic visits with longer consultations for intervention
patients. Total nurse and doctor costs were higher for intervention patients in the two cohorts (those not receiving
and those already receiving antiretroviral therapy). In the cohort not receiving antiretroviral therapy at enrolment the
mean antiretroviral prescription costs were higher in the intervention group
Notes
Neilson 2015
Methods
Regression analysis of costs and effects using intention-to-treat and expected value of sample information
Participants
125 patients with chronic pain and with complete resource use and SF-6 dimension questionnaire data at baseline,
three and six months
Interventions
Patients were randomised to either pharmacist medication review with face-to-face pharmacist prescribing or phar-
macists medication review with feedback to general practitioner or treatment as usual
Outcomes
The differences in costs and effects in terms of QALYs associated with pharmacist prescribing and or review compared
with treatment as usual in managing chronic pain in primary care was undertaken on data derived from Bruhn 2013.
Adjusted mean cost differences per patient relative to treatment as usual were GBP 77 for prescribing (95% CI -82
to 237) and GBP 54 for review (95% CI -103 to 212). Pharmacist-led interventions for chronic pain appeared more
costly and provide similar QALYs. The estimates were imprecise due to the small size of the pilot trial

less likely than physicians to pro-
vide patients on their first visit
with IUDs, prescribe oral contra-
ceptives, or sterilisation. Nurses

Medication possession ratios
The medication possession ratio (total days’ supply of
medication divided by total number of expected med-
ication intake days) used in this study found little or
no difference between the pharmacist prescribing arm
and usual care, even though more medications were pre-
scribed in the pharmacist arm. Adherence was high and
ranked above 80%
Finley 2003
Medication possession ratios
Determined the medication possession ratio from com-
puterised prescription refill records. Full drug adherence
was defined as a medication possession ratio value of
0.83 or more during the six-month follow-up. Medi-
cation possession ratios at three and six months were
probably not different between intervention and con-
trol arms even though patients in the intervention group
were more likely to change antidepressants. An addi-
tional measure, the Health Plan Employer Data Infor-
mation Set guidelines for successful antidepressant treat-
ment, showed there was little or no difference between
groups in compliance with the early phase of treatment,
but there was a significant difference in compliance in
the intervention group continuation phase

The drug event monitor provided the average number of
days on which patients took the correct number of doses
prescribed. While adherence was high in both groups,
the nurse-managed patient group had higher adherence
than usual care
Vivian 2002
Patient self-reporting and drug refill information from
the pharmacy
Non-adherence was judged as missing more than three
doses a week or pharmacy records indicated a failure to re-
fill drugs within two weeks after the scheduled refill date.
Little or no difference in adherence between or within
the two groups at baseline or the end of the study was
found. Over 90% of patients in both groups indicated
they took their drugs as directed. The study was under-
powered to detect a significant difference in adherence

11 patient satisfaction statements derived from a local
prescribing feasibility study
For the prescribing intervention, patients were generally
positive about the pharmacist prescribing service - 85%
(39/46) were totally satisfied, while 9% (4/44) would
have preferred to see their GP
. In semi-structured in-
terviews with GPs and pharmacists, all pharmacists and
most GPs were positive about the intervention. Phar-
macists found their role satisfying, interesting, and chal-
lenging. 17 of 23 GPs were positive about the phar-
macists’ role. The cost-effectiveness of the pharmacists’
role, given limited resources, was one issue raised in the
GP focus group

The total satisfaction sum score for 14 PEQD measures
for practice nurses was 66.4%, compared to 51.7% in

Patient Satisfaction Questionaire
Improvements in four areas of satisfaction in the inter-

Adverse event
Ansari 2003
There was little or no difference in the proportions of patients between control (provider education), nurse
facilitator and provider/patient notification for hospitalisations and emergency room visits. There were few
deaths with the higher number (7) in the control group which had more patients on haemodialysis, two of
whom died
Aubert 1998
There appeared little or no difference between intervention and usual care groups for severe low blood
glucose events at baseline and during the study period. Mean weight gain differences from insulin treatment
in each group or mean weight loss differences with oral agents showed little or no difference
Chenella 1983
Reported no patients had major bleeding, but four patients in the pharmacist prescriber group had minor
bleeding (one laceration before hospital). One patient in physician prescriber group died, after receiving
heparin and warfarin for a stroke in evolution but there was no evidence of bleeding
DeBusk 1994
The first year mortality was 3.4% in usual care and 4.1% in the intervention group. However, a longer
study is required to show a difference, namely, 2 years plus a 5- to 10-year follow-up
Fairall 2008

Adverse events were similar between groups, with no participants withdrawing from the study due to an
adverse event, and there was no difference in the rate of hospitalisation or death between the groups
Jaber 1996
Reported 17 hypoglycaemic reactions in the intervention group and two in the control group. All were
considered mild to moderate. The difference was possibly related to increased training in recognition,
documentation, and questioning in the intervention group. Three patients were hospitalised, two in the
control and one in the intervention group, and these appear unrelated to treatment
Klingberg-Allvin 2015
In treating incomplete abortion bleeding, the same or less than normal menstrual cycle was probably not
different between the intervention midwife and usual care physician groups. There was little difference in
pain after treatment as assessed by a visual analogue scale. 30 (6%) of women reported unscheduled visits in
the midwife group and 18 (4%) in the physician group. Reasons included vaginal bleeding and abdominal
pain. Reported side-effects after treatment were similar in both groups (nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain,
chills, and fever)
Kuethe 2011
There were no differences between groups (general practitioner, paediatrician, asthma nurse) with respect
to the number of severe asthma exacerbations as expressed by the number of prednisolone courses

Forty drug-related adverse events occurred in the intensive intervention group as compared to 10 in the
standard group. While the adverse events are known for the drugs in question no further comment was
offered
McAlister 2014
Reported few clinical events at six months in a pharmacist-led intervention for secondary prevention after
ischaemic stroke. There were nine cardiovascular events and no deaths in the pharmacist group versus eight
cardiovascular events and one death in the nurse-led group
Margolis 2013
There were 60 adverse events in usual care and 49 in the telemonitoring group; most events were non-
cardiac hospitalisations. There were two allergic reactions to blood pressure medication in the usual care
group, six events in the telemonitoring group related to hypotension, dizziness, loss of consciousness which
compared to one in the usual care group, four events in usual care related to hypertension versus one in
the intervention group
New 2003
In patients randomised to specialist nurse-led clinics for blood pressure control, lipid control or both, there
were less deaths in the intervention group (25, (3.2%) versus 36 (5.7%) in the usual care group) odds ratio

MacMahon Tone 2009
There were more intervention intensive group patients on three or more antihypertensive drugs
(at the study beginning more patients in the standard care group were on three or more anti-

antiplatelet therapy at the end of the study
McAlister 2014
The median number of antihypertensive medications taken at six months was probably not
different in the pharmacist- and nurse-led groups. There was a difference favouring pharmacists
in maximal dosing of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers
at six months, but not the percentage of patients using these drugs
Magid 2013
In patients completing the six-month visit, there were more intervention patients that had an
antihypertensive medication added to their regimen and a dose increased for existing medication,

Thompson 1984
The average number of drugs prescribed per patient was lower in the pharmacist group compared
to the physician group. The number of drugs was reduced by an average of 2.2 drugs per patient
from the pre-study to the study year. The practice of clinical pharmacists prescribing drug therapy
under physician supervision has the potential to save the healthcare system USD 70,000 per 100
skilled nursing facility beds
Tsuyuki 2015
In the pharmacist prescribing arm proportionally more new antihypertensive agents were initi-

There was little or no difference in the type of antihypertensives prescribed to intervention and

Aubert 1998
Hospital admissions were rare and did not differ between the intervention and usual care groups.
ED visits did not differ between groups or from baseline. No hospital or ED visits were related
to diabetes. The average number of outpatient visits during the study was similar. The nurse
managed a case load of 71 patients, but it was estimated that a 300 patient case load could be
managed
Barr Taylor 2003
There was no change in health utilisation (physician visits, ED visits, days of hospitalisation) for

Cohen 2011
Over six months there were a higher number of primary care visits in the usual care arm; an

Ellis 2000
In investigating the impact of clinical pharmacist interventions in patients with dyslipidaemia
there was little or no difference in physician or nurse visits between control and the intervention
patients at 12 months. At 12 months the intervention group had more pharmacist visits than
the control group. There were little or no difference in costs for hospitalisations, clinic visits,
laboratory costs, drug costs, and costs of lipid therapy between groups. The intervention group
had a USD 370 greater difference per patient in total costs which was probably not important
and approximately 5% of total costs
Fairall 2008
In the cohort of patients not yet receiving antiretroviral therapy there was little or no difference

In the cohort of patients who had already received at least six months of antiretroviral therapy
clinic visits with a nurse probably higher in the intervention group. Economic data from the
study is the subject of further analysis by Barton 2013 (see Studies awaiting classification).
Finley 2003
Although the collaborative care model experienced a decrease in the total number of primary
care visits, the between-group difference was probably not important. ED visits increased more
in the usual care group but this was probably not important and neither was the difference in
utilisation of psychiatric services. The institutional cost of drugs, the cost of antidepressants and
the cost of psychotropic drugs overall was higher in the intervention group, but this was not
important
Fischer 2012
Hospital admissions (while trending to fewer admissions) in the nurse intervention group showed
little or no difference to the control group. Nurse case management was not associated with a
significant difference in the number of outpatient or ED visits. There was a decrease in total costs
in the nurse telephone intervention group comparing the period before and after randomisation.
In contrast, there was an increase for the same comparison in the control group. Similar results
were seen with hospitalisation and ED costs which were lower in the intervention group. There
was probably not an intervention effect on outpatient costs. The difference in average per patient
cost between the intervention group (USD 6600) and control group (USD 9033) of USD
2433 was important. The control group had higher baseline hospitalisation rates and total costs
cautioning interpretation of the result

There was a lower number of visits in the NSD group compared with standard care but not in the
duration of visits. Significantly more patients were referred back to their GP by the NSD when
meeting treatment goals. Personnel and laboratory costs were lower in the intervention group
than the control group. The average per month increase in medication costs between the groups
was probably not important apart from the cholesterol-lowering medications. The average time
saving per internist was 61.4 minutes (meaning the internist could supervise 11 patients with

There was little or no difference in the average length of stay or hospitalisations although the
latter trended lower in the pharmacist group. Differences favouring the pharmacist group were
found in the rate of discharge to home or to a lower level of care

The authors are researchers in the area of non-medical prescribing. While their studies may be referenced in the review Background, it
is unlikely they will meet inclusion criteria for studies to be included in the review.
GW: none known.
JG: Dr George is a chief investigator on investigator-initiated research grants or grant applications supported by Pfizer Australia,
Boehringer-Ingelheim, and Australian Lung Foundation. These organisations had no involvement in the design of those studies, analysis
of data, or publications resulting from those studies.

The interventions in acute and secondary care were combined, as were interventions in chronic and primary care.
The fixed-effect model for meta-analyses was compared to the random-effects model.
Secondary outcomes: Deleted: ’Differential effects across advantaged and disadvantaged populations based on place of residence or
socio-economic status’.
Secondary outcomes: ’Patient-reported outcomes’ replaced the term ’humanistic outcomes’ and appears before resource use.
Dealing with missing data: Added: ’Imputing missing data was only considered when continuous outcomes were reported without
measures of variance’.
Assessment of heterogeneity: Added: ’We determined that heterogeneity might not be important between 0% and 40%, 30% to 60%
represented moderate heterogeneity, 50% to 90% substantial heterogeneity, and 75% to 100% considerable heterogeneity’.
Measures of treatment effect: Deleted: ’For ITS studies, we will report regression analysis with time trends before and after the
intervention. If possible we will re-analyse data for ITS studies where there is inappropriate analysis or reporting of results using the
methods described in Ramsay 2003’.
Unit of analysis issues: Deleted: ’We will re-analyse inappropriately designed ITS studies using time-series regression and report a
statistical comparison of time trends with a minimum of three data points before and after the intervention’.
We revised the database list to reflect current availability and coverage of the resources available at the time of update. The search
methods meet the current MECIR criteria.
