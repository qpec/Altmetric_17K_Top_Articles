SUMMARY
Modeling of neurological diseases using induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) derived from the somatic cells of patients has provided a
means of elucidating pathogenic mechanisms and performing drug screening. Tcells are an ideal source of patient-specific iPSCs because
they can be easily obtained from samples. Recent studies indicated that iPSCs retain an epigenetic memory relating to their cell of origin
that restricts their differentiation potential. The classical method of differentiation via embryoid body formation was not suitable for
T cell-derived iPSCs (TiPSCs). We developed a neurosphere-based robust differentiation protocol, which enabled TiPSCs to differentiate
into functional neurons, despite differences in global gene expression between TiPSCs and adult human dermal fibroblast-derived iPSCs.
Furthermore, neurons derived from TiPSCs generated from a juvenile patient with Parkinson’s disease exhibited several Parkinson’s dis-
ease phenotypes. Therefore, we conclude that TiPSCs are a useful tool for modeling neurological diseases.
INTRODUCTION
Neurological diseases have mainly been studied using ani-
mal models and immortalized neural cell lines due to the
difficulties associated with examining the CNS of patients.
Recent advances in human induced pluripotent stem cell
(hiPSC) technologies have enabled neurological diseases
to be modeled by culturing patient-specific neural cells in
dishes (Imaizumi and Okano, 2014; Marchetto and Gage,
2012). The first hiPSCs were generated from cultured
dermal fibroblasts by inducing reprogramming factors (Ta-
kahashi et al., 2007). hiPSCs derived from fibroblasts have
been recognized as the standard iPSCs for several years.
Therefore, most previously reported patient-specific hiPSC
lines were generated from skin fibroblasts (Brennand et al.,
2011; Imaizumi et al., 2012). Skin biopsies of patients are
required to generate dermal fibroblast lines, and this can
cause bleeding, infection, and scarring. Therefore, pa-
tient-specific hiPSCs should ideally be generated using
less invasive procedures, but the resulting cells must have
a similar pluripotency as dermal fibroblast-derived hiPSCs.
Yamanaka and colleagues first reported that iPSCs can be
generated from various types of somatic cells, including he-
patocytes (Aoi et al., 2008). Since then, several groups have
generated hiPSCs from peripheral blood nuclear cells
(PBMC) (Loh et al., 2010; Mack et al., 2011; Seki et al.,
2010), which can be easily obtained from patients using
minimally invasive methods. Among these reports, Fukuda
and colleagues showed that a small number of CD3-posi-
tive T cells can be efficiently reprogrammed into iPSCs
using Sendai virus (SeV) vectors (Seki et al., 2010). CD3-
positive T cells can be cultured in vitro using plates coated
with an anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody (mAb) and in the
presence of recombinant interleukin-2 (rIL-2). These cells

 can be stored in frozen vials and thawed several months
later. Thus, CD3-positive T cells can be obtained non-inva-
sively, are easily stored and efficiently reprogrammed, and
might therefore be an ideal source of patient-specific iPSCs.
We sought to determine whether T cell-derived iPSCs
(TiPSCs) could be used to analyze neurological diseases.
Several issues regarding the utilization of TiPSCs in neuro-
logical studies remain unresolved. First, previous studies
indicated that each iPSC clone retains an epigenetic mem-
ory relating to the cell type from which they are derived,
even after their re-differentiation into somatic cells, and
this restricts their differentiation potential (Kim et al.,
2010, 2011; Panopoulos et al., 2012; Polo et al., 2010).
Kim et al. reported that there are distinct differences in
the genome-wide DNA methylation profiles of iPSCs
derived from cord blood cells (CB-iPSCs) and iPSCs derived
from neonate keratinocytes (K-iPSCs), and that these differ-
ences are closely related to their differentiation potentials.
K-iPSCs had an enhanced potential to differentiate into
keratinocytes in comparison with CB-iPSCs, even though
both types of iPSCs were established from the same donor.
Second, rearrangement of T cell receptor (TCR) chain genes
in mature T cells indicates that they are not identical to
naive lymphocytes at the genomic level. Although such re-
arrangements are reportedly retained in TiPSCs (Seki et al.,
2010), it is unknown whether they affect the neural differ-
entiation and function of TiPSCs.
In the present study, we showed that TiPSCs have a
reduced tendency to differentiate into the neural lineage
via embryoid body (EB) formation in comparison with
adult human dermal fibroblast-derived iPSCs (aHDF-iPSCs).
To overcome this, we established a neurosphere-based
robust differentiation protocol that uses a low density of
cells and hypoxic conditions. Using this method, TiPSCs
efficiently and stably differentiated into mature functional
neurons, similar to aHDF-iPSCs.
Furthermore, we demonstrated that TiPSC-derived neu-
rons could be used as a Parkinson’s disease model.
RESULTS
Generation of Genetically Matched hiPSCs from
T Cells and Skin Fibroblasts
To compare TiPSCs and aHDF-iPSCs in a similar genetic
background (i.e., rearrangements of TCR chain genes), we
generated these cells from Tcells and dermal fibroblasts iso-
lated from a healthy donor. TiPSCs (eTKA4, eTKA5, TKA7
[DNAVEC], TKA14 [DNAVEC], TKA4 [AIST], and TKA9
[AIST]) were generated from CD3-positive lymphocytes us-
ing episomal plasmid vectors (containing OCT4, SOX2,
KLF4, L-MYC, LIN28, EBNA1, and shp53 or dominant-nega-
tive p53) (Okita et al., 2013) or SeV vectors, which were
produced by DNAVEC Corp. (Cytotune) or the National
Institute of Advanced Industrial Sciences and Technology
(AIST). The DNAVEC SeV vector carried OCT4, SOX2,
KLF4, or c-MYC on each of four vectors (Fusaki et al.,
2009), whereas the AIST SeV vector carried all four reprog-
ramming factors on a single vector (Nishimura et al., 2011).
aHDF-iPSCs (KA11, KA23, eKA3, and eKA4) were also
generated from the same healthy donor using retroviruses
(OCT4, SOX2, KLF4, and c-MYC) or episomal plasmid vec-
tors (Okita et al., 2013).
Immunocytochemical analysis revealed that all TiPSC
clones expressed the pluripotency markers TRA-1-60 and
stage-specific embryonic antigen 4 (SSEA4) (Figure 1A) at
levels comparable with those in aHDF-iPSC clones. Expres-
sion of OCT4 and NANOG was quantified by qPCR (Figures
1B and 1C). Transgenes used for reprogramming were not
detected by RT-PCR (Figure S1A). The genomic structure
did not significantly differ between TiPSCs and aHDF-iPSCs
according to a comparative genomic hybridization array
(Figure S1B). We next examined TCRb rearrangements in
genomic DNA of TiPSC clones to confirm that they were re-
programmed from CD3-positive T cells (Figure S1C). We
amplified and analyzed TCRb genomic regions by PCR
and capillary electrophoresis. aHDF-iPSC clones (KA11
and PB2) did not show a specific positive peak indicative
of TCRb rearrangement in the Vb/Jb1,2, Vb/Jb2, or Db/Jb
region, whereas TiPSC clones (TKA4 [AIST], TKA9 [AIST],
TPB4 [DNAVEC], and TPB8 [DNAVEC]) showed at least
one specific peak in these regions. These results suggest
that TiPSC clones were derived from CD3-positive T cells
with TCRb rearrangement.
Comparison of the Biological Characteristics of TiPSCs
and aHDF-iPSCs
To determine whether the origin of hiPSCs affects their
global gene expression, we evaluated the global transcrip-
tional profiles of TiPSCs and aHDF-iPSCs that were
passaged fewer than 10–15 times using microarray analysis.
Data, excluding genes whose expression values were low in
all samples, were normalized and subjected to PCA and
hierarchical clustering (Figures 1D and 1E). The samples
could be crudely divided into three categories: T cells,
aHDF, and pluripotent stem cells (PSC) (including TiPSCs,
aHDF-iPSCs, and ESCs). Hierarchical clustering placed
TiPSCs and aHDF-iPSCs into different groups (Figure 1E).
On the other hand, TiPSCs generated using SeV vectors
from DNAVEC Corp. (Fusaki et al., 2009) and those gener-
ated using SeV vector from AIST (Fusaki et al., 2009; Nishi-
mura et al., 2011) did not cluster separately, and neither
did aHDF-iPSCs generated using retroviruses and those
generated using episomal plasmid vectors. The genome
methylation profiles of TiPSC and aHDF-iPSC clones were
compared by ChIP-seq analysis. Methylated genomic

 DNA was precipitated using a recombinant methyl-binding
domain-containing protein and sequenced using a next-
generation sequencer. The data were subjected to hierarchi-
cal clustering (Figure S1D). Consistent with the expression
profiles, this analysis placed TiPSCs and aHDF-iPSCs into
different groups according to the cell type from which
they were derived. In addition, we identified 39 genes
that were upregulated in the TiPSCs relative to aHDF-iPSCs
(fold change >5.0). A gene ontology analysis identified a
number of immune response-associated terms, suggesting
that T cell-specific genes were still activated in the TiPSCs
(Table S1). These data suggest that the cell type of origin

 influences the properties of the hiPSCs generated from the
same donor.
Compared with aHDF-iPSCs, the TiPSCs Were Poorly
Differentiated into the Neural Lineage by an EB-Based
Spontaneous Neural Differentiation Protocol
To confirm the impact of the original cell types on the iPSC
differentiation, we evaluated whether TiPSCs could differ-
entiate into neural stem/progenitor cells (NS/PCs) as effi-
ciently as aHDF-iPSCs by using EB. In accordance with
the previous studies using this method (Nori et al., 2011),
we initially formed EBs from dissociated hiPSCs, and differ-
entiated them into NS/PCs in a subsequent step (Figure 2A).
When we cultured dissociated hiPSCs under the floating
culture condition, all of the hiPSC lines converted EBs
with a similar EB formation number (Figures 2B and 2C).
We dissociated these EBs to expand NS/PCs in serum-free
medium containing fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF-2)
and thereby generate neurospheres. All of the TiPSC lines
we tested (TKA4 [AIST], TKA9 [AIST], TKA7 [DNAVEC],
and TKA14 [DNAVEC]) formed few neurospheres, while
all aHDF-iPSC lines were able to form neurospheres within
12 days (Figures 2D–2F).
We next tested a forced neural differentiation protocol
using two inhibitors of SMAD signaling, SB431542 and
Noggin, which were previously reported to induce dual
SMAD inhibition (DSi) (Chambers et al., 2009) during EB
formation. Although the EB method with DSi increased
the average number of neurospheres formed compared
with untreated control aHDF-iPSC (Figure 2F), the differ-
ence was not statistically significant because of the high
level of variation among the iPSC lines. In contrast, the
TiPSC-derived EBs formed very few neurospheres, even
with DSi (Figures 2D–2F).
To assess the differences in the properties between aHDF-
iPSC-EB and TiPSC-EB, we next quantified the expression
levels of various genes in the neurospheres. qPCR analysis
revealed that expression of the neural markers PAX6,
NESTIN, SOX1, and TUBB3 was much lower in TiPSC-
derived EBs than in aHDF-iPSC-derived EBs (Figure S2B).
However, the expression of mesendodermal (BRACHYURY)
and endodermal (SOX17) markers was higher in TiPSC-
derived EBs than in aHDF-iPSC-derived EBs (Figure S2C).
DSi significantly upregulated the expression of NESTIN
and SOX1, and slightly decreased the expression of
BRACHYURY and SOX17, in aHDF-iPSC-derived EBs (Fig-
ures S2B and S2C). In contrast, the TiPSC-derived EBs
were hardly affected by DSi, and the expression of neural
markers remained much lower than that in the aHDF-
iPSC-derived EBs (Figures S2B and S2C).
In an additional approach to neural differentiation, we
cultured feeder-free TiPSCs under DSi conditions (Cham-
bers et al., 2009). Dissociated iPSCs were plated on
Matrigel-coated plates in complete conditioned media.
After 3 days, further cultivation utilized knockout serum
replacement media and/or N2 media containing 10 mM
SB431542 and 200 ng/ml Noggin for 10 days (Figure 2G).
We quantified the cell number during the differentiation
period to assess the efficiency of neural differentiation.
Although
all
aHDF-iPSC
lines
tested
(KA11,
KA23,
eKA3, and eKA4) yielded a set number of cells during
neural induction, all TiPSC lines (TKA4 [AIST], TKA9
[AIST], TKA7 [DNAVEC], TKA14 [DNAVEC], eTKA4 and
eTKA5) showed a marked time-dependent decrease in
cell number (Figures 2H and 2I). Immunocytochemical
analysis revealed that both differentiated TiPSCs and
aHDF-iPSCs expressed the neural marker PAX6, although
the density of TiPSC-derived PAX6-positive cells was poor
(Figure 2J).
We also tested whether the neural rosette method could
induce NS/PCs from EBs (Koch et al., 2009). However,
rosette-like
cells
derived
from
TiPSCs
expressed
few
NS/PC markers (Figure S3). These data suggest that TiPSCs
exhibit poor differentiation into neuro-ectoderm lineage
compared with aHDF-iPSCs, even in the presence of dual
SMAD inhibition.

 TiPSCs Can Be Differentiated into the Neural Lineage
as Effectively as aHDF-iPSCs Using a Method with
Direct Neurosphere Formation
TiPSCs preferentially differentiated into mesodermal and
endodermal cells, not ectodermal cells, during EB forma-
tion (Figure S2). The absence of ectodermal cells in EBs
reduced the formation of neurospheres from dissociated
EBs. To overcome this differentiation preference of TiPSCs,
we developed a method to induce neurons from iPSCs that
does not involve EB formation (Figure 3A). It has been
reported that low-density dissociation of mouse ES cells,
in the absence of serum, resulted in most of the cells ex-
pressing neural markers (Tropepe et al., 2001). Therefore,
we simply dissociated hiPSCs into single cells and cultured
these cells in serum-free medium to induce ectodermal
cells.
Dissociated hiPSCs are vulnerable to apoptosis. To avoid
this, we added Y27632, which promotes the survival of sin-
gle hiPSCs (Watanabe et al., 2007), and cultured cells
in hypoxic conditions, which promotes the survival of
NS/PCs by inhibiting apoptosis (Clarke and van der Kooy,
2009). As expected, these conditions enhanced the number
of neurospheres formed (Figure S4). Neurospheres formed
after 14 days of culture in medium containing FGF-2,
Y27632, and human leukemia inhibitory factor (hLIF) un-
der low-oxygen conditions (Figure 3A). We compared the

 efficiency of neural induction between TiPSCs and aHDF-
iPSCs using this direct neurosphere (dNS) method. The
numbers of neurospheres induced from TiPSCs (TKA4
[AIST], TKA9 [AIST], TKA7 [DNAVEC], TKA14 [DNAVEC],
eTKA4, and eTKA5) and aHDF-iPSCs (KA11, KA23, eKA3,
and eKA4) did not significantly differ (Figures 3B and 3C).
To clarify the regional identity of the neurospheres
formed by this dNS method, we next examined the expres-
sion of anteroposterior markers in hiPSC-derived neuro-
spheres by an immunocytochemical analysis. Both the
TiPSC- and aHDF-iPSC-derived neurospheres mostly ex-
pressed the forebrain marker, FOXG1 (Oliver et al., 1995),
and
the
forebrain/midbrain
marker,
OTX2
(Simeone
et al., 1992) (Figures 3D and 3E). However, only a few of
these neurospheres expressed EN1, which is expressed in
the mesencephalon and the metencephalon (Hanks et al.,
1995), or HOXB4, a marker of the myelencephalon and
the spinal cord (Hunt et al., 1991) (Figures 3D and 3E).
These results indicated that both the TiPSC- and aHDF-
iPSC-derived neurospheres were similarly differentiated
into the anterior region around the forebrain/midbrain
by this dNS method.
To confirm the robustness of the dNS method in the
neural differentiation of TiPSCs, we generated TiPSCs
from two additional donors (FK and PB); FK cells derived
from another healthy donor, and PB cells derived from a
patient with a PARK2 mutation, which is known to cause
juvenile Parkinson’s disease (PARK2). We had previously es-
tablished fibroblast-derived hiPSCs from this patient (Imai-
zumi et al., 2012). Using the dNS method, the numbers of
neurospheres were not significantly decreased and differ-
entiated similarly even if they were generated from the
various TiPSC clones (TFK7 [DNAVEC], TFK12 [DNAVEC],
TPB4 [DNAVEC], TPB8 [DNAVEC], TPB11 [DNAVEC], and
TPB27 [DNAVEC]) (Figure S5).
iPSCs favor differentiation along the lineage of the cell
type from which they are derived (Kim et al., 2010, 2011;
Polo et al., 2010). However, Yamanaka and colleagues re-
ported that hepatic differentiation of hiPSCs is largely
influenced by differences in the donor, rather than by the
cell type from which they are derived (Kajiwara et al.,
2012). We sought to determine how donor differences
and the original cell type influence the neural differentia-
tion of hiPSCs. The global transcriptional profiles of iPSCs
and iPSC-derived neurospheres generated from T cells or
fibroblasts of the healthy donor and PARK2 patient
(KA23, eKA3, TKA4 [AIST], TKA9 [AIST], PB2, PB20, TPB4
[DNAVEC], and TPB8 [DNAVEC]) were examined. The
gene expression analysis of iPSCs showed that there were
differences in their properties associated with the original
cell types and donors, while the analysis of NSs obtained
using the dNS method demonstrated that these differences
among iPSCs, especially those caused by different genetic
backgrounds, were smaller (Figures 3F–3I). In addition, as
shown in the Venn diagrams in Figures 3J and 3K, which
classified the cells based on the up- or downregulated genes
in comparison with aHDF-iPSC/TiPSC, iPSC (KA)/iPSC
(PB), and their NSs, the number of altered genes was also
much lower in the NSs than that in the iPSCs (aHDF-iPSC
versus TiPSC, 16 genes; iPSC(KA) versus iPSC(PB), 308
genes; aHDF-iPSC-NS versus TiPSC-NS, six genes; iPSC-
NS(KA) versus iPSC-NS(PB), 21 genes; moderated t test,
p < 0.05, fold change >2.0). These analyses indicate that
NS induction by the dNS method decreases the variations
in the iPSC properties caused by the differences in the
original cell types and donors. Furthermore, we included
six additional clones and quantified the expression of
pluripotency (OCT4 and NANOG) and NS/PC (PAX6 and
SOX1) markers by qPCR (Figures 4A–4D). The expression
of OCT4 was lower in neurospheres derived from PB clones
than in neurospheres derived from the other donors’
clones (Figures 4A and 4I). However, there was no differ-
ence in the expression of OCT4 between the cells based
on the cell origins or the methods used for iPSC derivation
(Figures 4E and 4M). Furthermore, the expression of
NANOG and NS/PC markers did not significantly differ
among the various neurospheres, regardless of the original
cell types, donors, or methods used to generate iPSCs
(Figures 4B–4D, 4F–4H, 4J–4L, and 4N–4P). These results
indicate that the dNS method could lead to the formation
of neurospheres from hiPSCs, independent of the cell types
of origin, donors, and iPSC generation methods, and could
minimize the differences in the differentiation propen-
sities of each hiPSC line.
TiPSCs Can Be Differentiated into Functional Neurons
and Cells of Various Neuronal Subtypes to a Similar
Extent as aHDF-iPSCs Using the dNS Method
We next examined whether NS/PCs derived from TiPSCs
could differentiate into functional neuronal subtypes as
efficiently as NS/PCs derived from aHDF-iPSCs. Neuro-
spheres were plated on fibronectin- and poly-L-ornithine
(PO)-coated plates and differentiated in media hormone
mix (MHM) containing B27, 10 ng/ml brain-derived neu-
rotrophic factor (BDNF), 10 ng/ml glial cell-derived neuro-
trophic factor (GDNF), 200 mM ascorbic acid, and 1 mM
dibutyryl-cAMP for 30–70 days. After 60 days, the differen-
tiated cells expressed the neural marker, microtubule-
associated protein 2 (MAP2), another neural marker,
bIII-tubulin (Tuj1), and an astrocyte marker, glial fibrillary
acidic protein (GFAP), with similar differentiation ratios
observed between the TiPSCs and aHDF-iPSCs, indicating
that they had equally differentiated into neurons and as-
trocytes (Figures 5A–5G). An immunocytochemical anal-
ysis revealed that these MAP2-positive neurons included
tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-positive dopaminergic neurons

 et al., 2014) and differentiated into neurons. TTX-sensitive
voltage-gated membrane currents were indistinguishable
between neurons derived from TiPSCs and those derived
from aHDF-iPSCs (Figure S6A). Na+ and K+ currents also
had similar current-voltage relationships in TiPSC-derived
neurons and aHDF-iPSC-derived neurons (Figure 5S). Cur-
rent-clamp measurements showed that these two types of
neurons both generated multiple action potentials (Fig-
ure S6B). We next investigated whether TiPSC-derived neu-
rons could form synapses. Evoked postsynaptic currents
were observed in whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings of
TiPSC-derived neurons (Figure 5T). These results show
that the dNS method can differentiate TiPSCs into func-
tional neurons, and that the electrophysiological function
of these neurons is indistinguishable from that of aHDF-
iPSC-derived neurons.
Neurons Derived from TiPSCs Established from a
PARK2 Patient Exhibited Several Different Parkinson’s
Disease Phenotypes
To determine whether hiPSCs established from the periph-
eral blood of patients can be used as a model of neurological
diseases, we differentiated TiPSCs derived from a patient
with PARK2, a familial form of Parkinson’s disease, into
neurons. A consistent neurochemical abnormality found
in Parkinson’s disease is the degeneration of dopami-
nergic neurons in the substantia nigra. Therefore, we first
modified the dNS method to generate midbrain dopami-
nergic neuron (mDAN)-enriched culture by treating the
cells with several small molecules, FGF-8, sonic hedgehog
(Shh), purmorphamine (PMA), and CHIR99021 (CHIR)
during the NS formation, for a total of 42 days (Figure 6A).
qPCR showed that there was upregulation of markers of
mDAN
differentiation,
including
EN1,
LMX1A,
and
FOXA2 (Figure 6B). After they were allowed to mature for
13 days, immunostaining of the neural epithelial cells
demonstrated that nearly 20% of the MAP2-positive cells
expressed the dopaminergic neuron marker, TH (Figures
6C and 6D). These data related to the expression pattern
marked the acquired TH-positive neurons as mDANs (Fig-
ures 6B–6D).
The PARK2 patient-derived TiPSCs (TPB4 [DNAVEC],
TPB8 [DNAVEC], TPB11 [DNAVEC], and TPB27 [DNAVEC])
had a homozygous deletion in exons 6 and 7 of the PARK2
gene (Figure 6E), expressed the human pluripotent markers
TRA-1-60 and SSEA4 (Figure S5), and could differentiate
into dopaminergic neurons (Figure S5). Parkin is a compo-
nent of an E3 ubiquitin ligase involved in mitochondrial
homeostasis (Shimura et al., 2000). We previously reported
that the hiPSCs established from fibroblasts of a PARK2 pa-
tient (the same patient used as the source of TiPSCs in the
current study) exhibited an abnormal turnover of damaged
mitochondria (Imaizumi et al., 2012) and increased reac-
tive oxygen species (ROS) production in the neurons.
Therefore, we first treated TiPSC-derived neurons with
carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenyl hydrazone (CCCP),
which triggers the loss of mitochondrial membrane poten-
tial and results in the removal of damaged mitochondria.
To determine the extent to which damaged mitochondria
were eliminated after CCCP treatment, we visualized the
area of the inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM) using
an antibody against the IMM marker Complex-III core I.
Compared with untreated samples, CCCP treatment eli-
cited a dramatic decrease in the IMM area in control neu-
rons (TKA clones) but not in PARK2 neurons (TPB clones)
(Figures 6F and 6G).
Using the same neuronal samples treated with CCCP, we
next stained the cells for TH and quantified the ratio of
TH-positive neurons to evaluate the vulnerability of dopa-
minergic neurons to mitochondrial stress. We observed
that there was a decrease in the number of TH-positive
neurons in PARK2 neuronal cultures (TPB clones) due to
the treatment with CCCP (Figure 6H), indicating that the
dopaminergic neurons derived from PARK2-iPSCs were
more vulnerable to mitochondrial stress compared with
control-iPSCs.
Finally, we evaluated the ROS production in the neurons
derived from control- and PARK2-TiPSCs using the Cell-
ROX Green Reagent, which is weakly fluorescent while in
a reduced state and exhibits bright green photostable
fluorescence upon oxidation by ROS, with absorption/
emission maxima of �485/520 nm. The reactive CellROX
fluorescence was significantly increased in the PARK2 neu-
rons, indicating that there was increased ROS production
(Figures 6I and 6J). These phenotypes were also observed
in the neurons derived from aHDF-iPSCs (Figures 6F–6J).
These results strongly suggest that the hiPSCs derived
from patient T cells can be used as a model of neurological
disease.
DISCUSSION
hiPSCs can be used to generate neuronal cells in vitro,
which has widened the application of these cells. However,
the requirement for skin biopsies to be performed must
be overcome before iPSC technologies are widely adopted.
Seki et al. (2010) developed TiPSCs, which enabled iPSCs
to
be obtained
more
easily and with
less
invasive
methods. The current study shows that TiPSCs can differ-
entiate into functional neurons, including dopaminergic,
GABAergic, and glutamatergic subtypes, using an opti-
mized differentiation protocol, dNS method. Moreover,
these cells could be used to study the mechanisms under-
lying neuronal diseases, although there are some differ-
ences between TiPSCs and aHDF-iPSCs. Furthermore, the

 neurons differentiated from TiPSCs derived from a PARK2
patient exhibited several Parkinson’s disease phenotypes,
including an impairment of mitochondrial functions,
dopaminergic neuron-specific cell death, and increased
ROS production.
Most patients with neurological disorders, such as Par-
kinson’s disease, do not have a genetic background associ-
ated with the onset of the disease. Recent whole-exome
sequencing studies revealed that such sporadic diseases
are related to many rare variants. To elucidate the etiologies

 of these diseases, it is important to establish hiPSCs from a
sufficient number of patients and to characterize multiple
clones such that statistical analyses can be performed.
T cells are a suitable source of hiPSCs to model sporadic
neurological diseases owing to the ease with which they
can be obtained. In this article, we have shown that
neurons generated from TiPSCs exhibit phenotypes similar
to those of aHDF-iPSCs modeling Parkinson’s disease.
We will therefore address in future work the question of
whether TiPSCs can be used in the study of other neurolog-
ical diseases.
Some studies indicate that iPSCs retain a transient tran-
scriptional and epigenetic memory of their cell types of
origin, which can substantially affect their potential to
differentiate into various cell types, even among iPSCs
that are genetically identical (Kim et al., 2010, 2011; Polo
et al., 2010). Two independent studies of genetically
matched hiPSC clones established from skin or blood cells
examined how their differentiation potential is influenced
by their cell types of origin. Daley and colleagues reported
that blood cell-derived iPSCs differentiate into blood cells
more efficiently than keratinocyte-derived iPSCs, and the
latter iPSCs efficiently differentiate into keratinocytes
(Kim et al., 2011). They concluded that the differentiation
potential of hiPSCs is influenced by a residual epigenetic
memory of the tissue from which they are derived. They
also showed that extended passage of most iPSC lines
reduced the effect of cell origin by erasing the cells’ epige-
netic memory, although some clones failed to erase the
epigenetic memory, even after recurrent passaging. It is
possible that our protocol could minimize the differences
stemming from differences in epigenetic status after any
passage of iPSCs, which we will address in a future study.
However, a study by Yamanaka and colleagues reported
that blood cell-derived iPSCs and skin cell-derived iPSCs
can both differentiate into the hepatic lineage if they are es-
tablished from the same donor (Kajiwara et al., 2012). They
concluded that variations in hepatic differentiation are
largely owing to differences in the donors, rather than to
the cell types from which iPSCs are derived. Although these
two conclusions seem contradictory, it is possible that the
influences of epigenetic memory and donor differences
vary according to the lineage along which cells differen-
tiate. Here, we showed that TiPSCs failed to differentiate
along the neural lineage using the EB formation protocol.
The increased expression of mesendodermal and endo-
dermal markers in TiPSC-derived EBs suggests that TiPSCs
preferentially
differentiated
into
the
mesendodermal
lineage, rather than the ectodermal lineage. Our single-
cell dissociation protocol enabled TiPSCs to differentiate
into functional neuronal cells with a similar efficiency
as aHDF-iPSCs. Furthermore, TiPSC-derived neuronal cells
generated from a Parkinson’s disease patient exhibited
abnormal mitochondrial degradation similar to aHDF-
iPSC-derived neuronal cells. Our results suggest that this
robust directed differentiation protocol can overcome the
biased differentiation of iPSCs owing to epigenetic memory
of the original cells. Our results also suggest that TCR rear-
rangement does not affect the differentiation efficiency
when a directed neural differentiation method is used.
EBs contain cells that have differentiated from PSCs into
the three germ cell lineages in a spontaneous and unbiased
manner (Itskovitz-Eldor et al., 2000). However, TiPSC-
derived EBs contained few neural cells due to their reduced
potential to differentiate into the neural lineage. By
contrast, our differentiation protocol facilitated directed
neural differentiation by removing extracellular signals.
In relation to genetic background, Yamanaka and col-
leagues suggested that the propensity for hepatic differen-
tiation of iPSCs is affected by differences in the donor,
rather than in the original cell types (Kajiwara et al.,
2012). Our results suggest that differences in the donors,
original cell types, and iPSC generation methods can be
minimalized by using this differentiation protocol.
Recently, several studies have suggested that peripheral
blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) are a promising resource
for generating iPSCs because most of these cells do not un-
dergo TCR rearrangement (Loh et al., 2010; Mack et al.,
2011; Seki et al., 2010). However, PBMCs are composed of
several cell types (e.g., T cells, B cells, and CD34 + progeni-
tor cells), and each PBMC has an epigenetic memory of the
cell from which it is derived. It is possible that PBMC-
derived iPSCs restrict neural differentiation in a manner
similar to TiPSCs. Since our present neural differentiation
protocol was able to minimize the effect of cell origin,
our protocol could be presumably applicable to iPSCs
derived from other blood cell types.
Here, we suggest that the method of neural induction is
the most important factor in the study of neural cells
derived from human TiPSCs. The optimized induction
protocol allows various iPSC clones to differentiate into
functional neuronal cells, regardless of the cell types from
which they are derived. Therefore, TiPSCs can be used to
study neurological diseases and to recapitulate disease-
specific phenotypes, comparable with iPSCs derived from
fibroblasts or other cells, when generated using the opti-
mized differentiation protocol. We propose that T cells
are an ideal source of patient-specific iPSCs and will be
widely used for neurological disease modeling. We believe
that our present neural differentiation protocol will mini-
mize the effect of cell origin and is applicable to iPSCs
derived from other tissues. For example, urine epithelial
cells could be an excellent alternate source for the genera-
tion of iPSCs because monocytes without TCR rearrange-
ment can also be obtained in a less invasive fashion
(Song et al., 2011; Zhang et al., 2015; Zhou et al., 2011).

 These possibilities for modeling neurological diseases
should be investigated in the future.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Neural Differentiation In Vitro
A previously reported protocol was used for neural differentiation
of hiPSCs (Nori et al., 2011). Briefly, hiPSCs were dissociated and
cultured in suspension as EBs, which were subsequently dissoci-
ated and cultured in MHM supplemented with B27 (Life Technol-
ogies), 20 ng/ml fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF-2, Peprotech), and
10 ng/ml hLIF (Millipore).
Neural rosette differentiation was performed as previously
described (Koch et al., 2009). Four-day-old EBs were transferred
to poly-L-ornithine (PO)-coated tissue culture dishes and prop-
agated
in
ITSfn
medium
(DMEM/F-12
[Wako]
containing
25 mg/ml insulin [Wako], 100 mg/ml transferrin [Nakalai-tesque],
5 ng/ml selenite [Sigma-Aldrich], and 2.5 mg/ml fibronectin
[Sigma-Aldrich]). Within 10 days, neural tube-like structures devel-
oped in the EB outgrowth.
For neural induction from single hiPSCs, hiPSCs were incubated
with TrypLE Select (Life Technologies) for 5 min and dissociated
into single cells by pipetting. Cells were plated into a T75 flask
(Nunclon), then 103 cells were plated for the neurosphere formation
assay, and cultured in MHM supplemented with B27, 20 ng/ml
FGF-2, 10 mM Y-27632 (Wako), and 10 ng/ml hLIF in 4% oxygen
for 14 days. Neurospheres were repeatedly passaged by dissociation
into single cells, and then cultured in the same manner. Neuro-
spheres at passages 3–7 were typically used for analysis. For terminal
differentiation, dissociated neurospheres were allowed to adhere to
PO- (Sigma-Aldrich) and fibronectin-coated coverslips and cultured
in MHM containing B27, 10 ng/ml brain-derived neurotrophic fac-
tor (BDNF; R&D systems), 10 ng/ml glial cell-derived neurotrophic
factor (GDNF; R&D systems), 200 mM ascorbic acid (Sigma-Aldrich),
and 1 mM dibutyryl-cAMP (Sigma-Aldrich) for 10–70 days.
Ethics
For the use of human samples, human ethics approval was
obtained by the Ethics Committee of Keio University School of
Medicine.
