Diabetes Care 2016;39:1777–1786 | DOI: 10.2337/dc16-0650
OBJECTIVE
Cannabidiol (CBD) and D9-tetrahydrocannabivarin (THCV) are nonpsychoactive
phytocannabinoids affecting lipid and glucose metabolism in animal models. This
study set out to examine the effects of these compounds in patients with type 2
diabetes.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS
In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 62 subjects with non-
insulin-treated type 2 diabetes were randomized to five treatment arms: CBD
(100 mg twice daily), THCV (5 mg twice daily), 1:1 ratio of CBD and THCV
(5 mg/5 mg, twice daily), 20:1 ratio of CBD and THCV (100 mg/5 mg, twice daily),
or matched placebo for 13 weeks. The primary end point was a change in HDL-
cholesterol concentrations from baseline. Secondary/tertiary end points included
changes in glycemic control, lipid profile, insulin sensitivity, body weight, liver
triglyceride content, adipose tissue distribution, appetite, markers of inflamma-
tion, markers of vascular function, gut hormones, circulating endocannabinoids,
and adipokine concentrations. Safety and tolerability end points were also
evaluated.
RESULTS
Compared with placebo, THCV significantly decreased fasting plasma glucose
(estimated treatment difference [ETD] = 21.2 mmol/L; P < 0.05) and improved
pancreatic b-cell function (HOMA2 b-cell function [ETD = 244.51 points; P <
0.01]), adiponectin (ETD = 25.9 3 106 pg/mL; P < 0.01), and apolipoprotein A
(ETD = 26.02 mmol/L; P < 0.05), although plasma HDL was unaffected. Compared
with baseline (but not placebo), CBD decreased resistin (2898 pg/ml; P < 0.05) and
increased glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide (21.9 pg/ml; P < 0.05). None
of the combination treatments had a significant impact on end points. CBD and
THCV were well tolerated.
CONCLUSIONS
THCV could represent a new therapeutic agent in glycemic control in subjects with
type 2 diabetes.

EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES AND THERAPEUTICS
 The endocannabinoid system (ECS)
modulates food intake and energy ho-
meostasis (1,2), and chronic overactiva-
tion of the ECS has been identified in
obesity and type 2 diabetes (3). The
ECS exerts some of its actions by activat-
ing cannabinoid receptors 1 (CB1) and
2 (CB2). Modulation of CB1 receptors
with rimonabant (a synthetic cannabi-
noid) led to a significant reduction in
body weight, waist circumference, and
triglyceride (TG) concentrations, and an
increase in HDL cholesterol (HDL-C) and
adiponectin concentrations (4), as well
as a reduction in HbA1c in subjects with
type 2 diabetes (20.8 to 21.25%; P ,
0.001). However, marketing authoriza-
tion for rimonabant was withdrawn in
2008 because of an increased incidence
of psychiatric adverse events (AEs) (5).
Rimonabant is thought to be a CB1 re-
ceptor antagonist/inverse agonist, but it
is unclear whether modulation of other
cannabinoid receptor activity could have
beneficial metabolic effects without signif-
icant psychiatric effects.
Cannabidiol (CBD) is one of the major
phytocannabinoids obtained from the
Cannabis sativa L. plant. In rodent stud-
ies, CBD has multiple desirable effects in
the context of hyperglycemia, mainly
through its anti-inflammatory and anti-
oxidant properties (6–10). In animal
models of obesity (ob/ob genetically
obese mice), 4 weeks of treatment
with CBD 3 mg/kg produced a 55%
increase in HDL-C concentration and
reduced total cholesterol by .25%
(C.S., unpublished data). In addition,
the same dose reduced liver TGs and
increased both liver glycogen and adipo-
nectin concentration. There is also evi-
dence from animal studies showing that
CBD modulates cardiovascular response
to stress (11).
Unlike the related molecule Δ9-
tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), CBD does
not activate CB1 receptors in the brain
and therefore lacks the psychotropic ac-
tions of THC. Indeed, CBD may reduce
psychosis (12) and mitigate the psycho-
ses associated with cannabis misuse
(13). Other receptor sites implicated in
the actions of CBD include the orphan
G-protein–coupled receptor-55 (GPR55),
theputativeendothelialcannabinoidrecep-
tor, the transient receptor potential vanil-
loid 1 (TRPV1) receptor, a1-adrenoceptors,
m opioid receptors, and the adenosine
transporter and serotonin-1A receptors
(14). CBD also activates and has physio-
logical responses mediated by peroxi-
some proliferator–activated receptor g
(15–17). A CBD/THC combination (Sativex/
Nabiximols; GW Pharmaceuticals) is cur-
rently licensed in most European Union
countries and in Canada, New Zealand,
Australia, Malaysia, the United Arab
Emirates, and Kuwait, for the symptom-
atic treatment of spasticity in moderate
to severe multiple sclerosis, and CBD
alone (Epidiolex; GW Pharmaceuticals)
was granted orphan drug designation
by the U.S. Food and Drug Adminis-
tration in February 2014 in Dravet and
Lennox-Gastaut syndromes in children,
with phase 3 clinical trials ongoing in
those conditions.
D9-Tetrahydrocannabivarin (THCV)
is a naturally occurring analog of THC,
but with different pharmacological ef-
fects. It is has been reported to behave
as both a CB1/CB2 agonist and/or a CB1/
CB2-neutral antagonist (20–24), proba-
bly dose-dependent, with agonism ob-
served at high doses and antagonism
at low doses (19). However, there is little
evidence of CB1 agonism in vivo compared
with the observed in vivo effects of THC at
similar doses. Other target sites of action
include GPR55 (23) and transient receptor
potential channels (24,25).
Acute intraperitoneal administration
of THCV in rodents at 3, 10, and 30
mg/kg body weight caused hypophagia
and weight loss, with food intake and
body weight returning to normal on
day 2 (26). The effect was similar to
that of a CB1 antagonist, AM251, also
used in the same study. In another
study, involving diet-induced obese
mice, oral THCV (2.5–12.5 mg/kg) re-
duced body fat content, increased en-
ergy expenditure, and reduced fasting
insulin and 30-min insulin response to
oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) (27).
In the same study, in genetically obese
(ob/ob) mice, a similar increase in 24-h
energy expenditure was observed with
3 mg/kg THCV, whereas 12.5 mg/kg
THCV caused a significant reduction in
liver TGs (27). In genetically obese mice
(ob/ob), a 1:1 ratio of a combination of
THCV and CBD (3:3 mg/kg) reduced
change to total cholesterol levels by
19% and increased HDL-C by 50%. The
same combination reduced liver TG, in-
creased liver glycogen levels, reduced
fastinginsulin,andincreasedenergyexpen-
diture (C.S., unpublished data).
The findings from these preclinical
studies demonstrate a potential benefi-
cial effect of both CBD and THCV, alone
or in combination, in diabetes and lipid
metabolism, with very distinct pharma-
cological profiles, and therefore differ-
ent side effects, to rimonabant. This
prompted the first-ever investigation
of the effects of CBD and THCV on dysli-
pidemia and glycemic control in subjects
with type 2 diabetes.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS
Subjects and Study Design
This randomized, double-blind, placebo-
controlled, parallel-group, phase IIa
proof-of-concept study was conducted
at four U.K. centers. The protocol was
reviewed and approved by the East
Midlands–Leicester Multi Centre Research
Ethics Committee (10/H0406/42) and
local research and development depart-
ments as required and conducted in ac-
cordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.
All subjects provided written informed
consent.
Subjects aged $18 years with type 2
diabetes and HbA1c #10% (86 mmol/mol),
HDL-C #1.3 mmol/L in females and
#1.2 mmol/L in males, and plasma TGs
#10 mmol/L were eligible. Subjects
needed to either receive no oral hypo-
glycemic agents or take stable doses of
prespecified, noninsulin glucose-lowering
therapies (metformin, sulfonylurea, dipep-
tidylpeptidase-4inhibitor,orglucagon-like
peptide 1 [GLP-1] therapy) for 3 months
prior to screening. Subjects not on statin
therapy or on a stable dose of a statin for
at least 4 weeks prior to randomization
were eligible for inclusion. Subjects were
also required not to make any changes to
their diet or exercise for 4 weeks prior to
randomization and during the course of
the study.
Main exclusion criteria (see Supple-
mentary Data for full details) included
use of prohibited medications (insulin,
fibrates, thiazolidinediones, therapeutic
omega-3 fatty acids, and a-glucosidase
inhibitors), recent or current use of can-
nabis, history of significant depression,
planned travel outside the U.K. during
the course of study, genetic dyslipide-
mia, or significant cardiac, renal, or he-
patic impairment.
There was a 1- to 5-week period be-
tween screening (visit 1) and treatment
randomization (visit 2). Visit 1 could be
split into two separate visits (1A and 1B)
1778
CBD and THCV in Humans With Type 2 Diabetes
Diabetes Care Volume 39, October 2016
 to allow a 21-day washout period of the
prohibited medications prior to blood
sampling for eligibility. Remaining visits
occurred 4, 8, and 13 weeks after initia-
tion of treatment (visits 3, 4, and 5, re-
spectively) or earlier if patients withdrew.
A safety follow-up visit occurred 7 days
after study completion or withdrawal
(visit 6). Visits 4 and 6 were telephone
assessments.
Patients were required to take study
medication in the fasted state, twice daily,
30 min before breakfast and 30 min be-
fore evening meal, typically 12 h apart
for 13 weeks.
Study End Points and Assessments
The primary end point was change in
mean serum HDL-C from baseline, in
CBD and THCV groups, compared with
the change in placebo group at week
13. Secondary end points included
changes in lipid profile, glycemic control,
insulin sensitivity, body weight, visceralad-
iposity, appetite, and cardiovascular func-
tion. Tertiary end points were changes in
markers of inflammation, vascular func-
tion, adipokines, endocannabinoids, and
gut hormone concentrations.
Serum lipid concentrations were ana-
lyzed with the Roche modular system
using enzymatic calorimetric assays.
Nonesterified fatty acid concentrations
were quantified on the Roche COBAS
311 system (Roche), using an acyl-CoA
synthetase/acyl-CoA oxidase method.
Apolipoprotein markers were analyzed
on the Roche COBAS 311 system (Roche)
using immunoturbidimetric assays based
on the principle of immunological ag-
glutination. Plasma VLDL cholesterol
(VLDL-C) concentrations were determined
by ultracentrifugation.
A standard 75-g OGTT was performed,
and plasma glucose and serum insulin
were analyzed using the Roche modular
system (Roche) and Advia Centaur immu-
noassay analyzer (Siemens Healthcare),
respectively. HOMA-insulin resistance, in-
sulin sensitivity, and b-cell function were
calculated using the HOMA2 Calculator
v2.2 (Diabetes Trials Unit, University of
Oxford).
Plasma endocannabinoids N-arachido-
noylethanolamine (AEA), 2-arachidono-
ylglycerol (2-AG), oleoylethanolamine
(OEA), and palmitoylethanolamine (PEA)
were analyzed using liquid chromatography-
tandem mass spectrometry, based on a
previously published method (28). Ketones,
orexin A, and retinol-binding protein
4 (RBP-4) were analyzed using immuno-
assay, whereas all other tertiary end
points including adiponectin, resistin,
leptin, E-selectin, vascular cell adhesion
molecule,VonWillebrandfactor,C-reactive
protein(CRP),interleukin-6,tumornecrosis
factor-a, glucose-dependent insulinotropic
peptide (GIP), ghrelin, and GLP-1 were
analyzed by multiplex analysis, using
commercially available kits (Milliplex,
HMHMAG-34K, HCVD1-67AK, HADK-1-
61K-A, HCVD2-67BK, BPHCVD05-6; Merck
Millipore).
Resting blood pressure was measured
using a digital blood pressure monitor,
whereas cardiovascular parameters in-
cluding systolic, diastolic, and mean arte-
rial pressure, heart rate, stroke volume,
cardiac output, interbeat interval, ejection
time, and total peripheral resistance were
measured using a Finometer (Finapres
Medical Systems), which uses a finger-
clamp method to detect beat-to-beat
changes in digital arterial diameter with
an infrared photoplethysmograph.
Adipose tissue distribution was as-
sessed using whole-body MRI; images
were analyzed by a blinded investigator
using sliceOmatic (TomoVision, Magog,
Canada). Body weight and seven-point
skinfold measures were also recorded.
Hepatic TG concentration was assessed
using MRS and analyzed using JMRUI
software.
Patient’s Global Impression of Change
(PGIC) and Clinician’s Global Impression
of Change (CGIC) were assessed using an
ordinal seven-point Likert scale (1, very
much improved, to 7, very much worse).
Changes in appetite were established
using patients’ scores of their appetites
that they recorded on daily basis using
an appetite 0–10 numerical rating scale
(NRS), in which 0 is no appetite (do not
feel hungry) and 10 is maximum appe-
tite (completely hungry all the time)
(29). The change from mean baseline
score (mean of 7 days before start of
treatment) was compared with the
mean score from the last 7 days on
treatment (end of 13 weeks).
Safety assessments included reporting
for AEs and serious AEs (SAEs), recording
vital signs, pre- and posttreatment labora-
torysamplingandelectrocardiograms, and
change from baseline in Beck Depression
Inventory-II (BDI-II) scores.
The BDI-II questionnaire, an assess-
ment for anxiety and depression, is a
multiple-choice, self-reported inventory
and is one of the most widely used and
validated instruments for measuring se-
verity of depression (30).
Statistical Methods
An independent statistician produced a
schedule for random treatment alloca-
tion, which was held centrally and not
divulged to any other person involved in
the study until the database had been
locked. Patients were randomly allo-
cated to treatment groups in a 1:1:1 ra-
tio, stratified by center, according to the
randomization schedule. Study site staff
identified the pack number to be dis-
pensed to the subject at each of visits
2 and 3 according to the randomization
schedule.
Analysis was performed using the
intention-to-treat population; all sub-
jects who were randomized received at
least one dose of study medication and
had on-treatment efficacy data. All sta-
tistical tests were two-sided at the 5%
significance level. Between-group dif-
ferences and 95% CIs were also calcu-
lated. The primary end point and the
majority of secondary end points were
analyzed using ANCOVA of the changes
from baseline to the end of treatment in
the associated parameter, with the ex-
ception of the PGIC and CGIC, which
were analyzed with ordinal logistic re-
gression using the cumulative propor-
tional odds model. The parameter’s
baseline values were included as a cova-
riate, and treatment was included as a
factor. The tertiary variables were ana-
lyzed using ANCOVA with baseline value
as covariate and treatment group and
sex as factors or using pairwise Fisher
exact test, as appropriate. The null hy-
pothesis was one of no difference in the
effects of any of the active treatments
compared individually with placebo.
As this study was a phase 2a proof-of-
concept study, no formal sample size cal-
culation was performed.
Changes from baseline in all the
plasma markers were analyzed post hoc
using a paired t test, and the glucose re-
sponse to OGTT was analyzed using re-
peated-measures two-way ANOVA.
RESULTS
A total of 125 patients was screened and
62 randomized to the 5 treatment arms.

 between treatment groups (Table 1) in
terms of baseline characteristics.
Lipids
THCV had no effect on HDL-C concentra-
tions (Table 2), but it increased apolipopro-
tein A (Apo A) concentrations compared
with placebo from baseline to the end of
treatment (from 48.5 to 49.1 mmol/L in
the THCV vs. 47.3 to 43.9 mmol/L in the pla-
cebo group; P , 0.05) (Fig. 2A). THCV had
no effect on LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) con-
centrations. CBD alone and in combina-
tion with THCV did not affect any of the
lipid parameters (Table 2).
Glycemic Control
THCV reduced fasting plasma glucose
concentration compared with placebo
from baseline to the end of treatment
(from 7.4 to 6.7 mmol/L in the THCV vs.
7.6 to 8.0 mmol/L in the placebo group;
estimated treatment difference [ETD] =
21.24 6 0.6 [SEM]; P , 0.05) (Fig. 3A).
In line with this, there was a significant
increase in HOMA2 b-cell function in the
THCV treatment group compared with
placebo from baseline to the end of
treatment (from 105.1 to 144.4 in the
THCV group vs. 96.4 to 94.7 in the pla-
cebo group; ETD = 44.6 6 16.1 [SEM];
P , 0.01) (Table 2 and Fig. 3B). There
was no significant difference in glucose
response to OGTT at 2 h. However, when
compared with baseline, THCV sig-
nificantly improved 3-h blood glucose
response (P , 0.05) (Fig. 3C). CBD
alone or in combination with THCV
had no effect on glycemic parameters
(Table 2).
Vascular Function
Compared with placebo, CBD and THCV,
alone and in combination, had no effect
on cardiovascular parameters (Table 2)
or plasma markers of vascular function
(Supplementary Table 1).
Adipokines
There was an increase from baseline in
adiponectin concentration in the THCV
group and a reduction in placebo group;
the treatment difference was statisti-
cally significant in favor of THCV treat-
ment (ETD 25.9 3 106 pg/mL; P , 0.01)
(Fig. 3B). Plasma concentrations of lep-
tin and resistin remained unchanged
with THCV treatment. Compared with
baseline rather than placebo, CBD
caused a significant reduction in the
concentration of resistin (2898 pg/mL;
P , 0.05) (Fig. 3C), but had no effect on
leptin or adiponectin. Subjects taking a
combination of CBD and THCV had no
change in adipokine levels (Supplemen-
tary Table 1).
Markers of Inflammation
Both THCV and CBD, or their combina-
tion, had no significant effect on plasma
markers of inflammation (CRP, tumor
necrosis factor-a, and interleukin-6)
(Supplementary Table 1).
Gut Hormones
THCV, on its own and in combination
with CBD, had no effect on the concentra-
tions of gut signaling hormones including
GLP-1, GIP, and ghrelin (Supplementary
Table 1). However, in a post hoc analysis,
for which posttreatment concentrations
were compared with baseline (rather
than placebo), CBD caused a signifi-
cant increase in the concentration of
GIP (21.2 pg/mL; P , 0.05) (Fig. 3D),
without any effect on GLP-1 or ghrelin
concentrations.
Body Weight
Baseline mean body weight (kg 6 SD) in
the CBD, THCV, 1:1 CBD/THCV, 20:1
CBD/THCV, and placebo groups were
97.1 6 13.8, 98.3 6 17.5, 100.7 6
14.5, 100.5 6 17.9, and 94.2 6 19.1,
respectively. There were no statistically
significant changes in anthropometric
parameters including weight, waist cir-
cumference, waist-to-hip ratio, and
skinfold thickness in any of the treat-
ment groups (Table 2).

CBD and THCV in Humans With Type 2 Diabetes
Diabetes Care Volume 39, October 2016
 Visceral Adiposity and Liver TGs
There were no changes in visceral adipos-
ity or liver TG (Table 2) as assessed by
MRI/MRS in any of the treatment groups.
Appetite
None of the treatments had any signifi-
cant impact on appetite as assessed by
0–10 NRS scores (Table 2).
PGIC and CGIC
A full summary of the PGIC and CGIC
assessment responses is presented in
Supplementary Figs. 1 and 2. Analysis
of these responses showed a treatment
difference in favor of all the active treat-
ments, to varying degrees, but most no-
tably between the 1:1 CBD/THCV and
placebo treatment groups on CGIC.
There were reported improvements in
7 out of 11 (63.6%) patients in the CGIC
on 1:1 CBD/THCV treatment, compared
with only 2 of the 14 (14.3%) patients on
placebo, with a recorded improvement on
CGIG. This translated to a statistically sig-
nificant treatment effect of 1:1 CBD/THCV
treatment compared with placebo, with
an odds ratio of 9.529 (P , 0.05) in the
CGIC. No other statistically significant ef-
fects were calculated for any other active
treatment in either assessment.
Endocannabinoids
There was no significant change in the lev-
els of circulating AEA, 2-AG, OEA, and PEA
after 13 weeks of any treatment (Table 2).
Post Hoc Analysis in THCV Group
Analyzing Glucose Response to OGTT
and Changes in HbA1c
An improvement in glucose response
to OGTT was noted in the THCV group at
3 h (Fig. 3C). When subjects on any form
of diabetes treatment other than diet/
metformin were excluded from analysis,
this effect became more pronounced
(P , 0.05 at 1 h and P , 0.01 at 3 h;
n = 6) (Fig. 3D). In the same group of
patients receiving diet/metformin only,
compared with placebo, a significant im-
provement in HbA1c was also observed
(P , 0.05) (Fig. 3E).
Safety
The study medication was well toler-
ated, with the majority of subjects expe-
riencing AEs that were mild or moderate
in severity. Treatment-emergent (all
causality) AEs were reported by 11 of
13 (84.6%) subjects in the CBD group,
11 of 12 (91.7%) in the THCV group,
7 of 11 (63.6%) in the 1:1 CBD/THCV
group, and 8 of 11 (66.7%) in the 20:1
CBD/THCV group, compared with 13 of
14 subjects (92.9%) receiving placebo.
The more common treatment-related
AE reported by subjects in all the groups,
except for 20:1 CBD/THCV, was de-
creased appetite (two subjects [15.4%]
receiving CBD, four subjects [33.3%] re-
ceiving THCV, one subject [9.1%] receiv-
ing 1:1 CBD/THCV, and two subjects
[14.3%] receiving placebo). None of
the subjects in the 20:1 CBD/THCV
group experienced an AE of decreased
appetite. Two subjects reported diar-
rhea with THCV, compared with no sub-
jects in the placebo group. Two subjects
(14.3%) on placebo also reported dizzi-
ness. All other treatment-related AEs
were reported in individual subjects.
No deaths occurred during the study.
There were two SAEs in this study. One
patient (8.3%) taking 20:1 CBD/THCV
treatment experienced an SAE of myo-
cardial infarction that was considered
moderate in severity, had recovered by
the end of study, and was not consid-
ered to be treatment related. One pla-
cebo patient experienced an SAE of
myocardial ischemia that was not con-
sidered to be treatment related, was
mild in severity and occurred on day
92 of the study; the SAE was still ongoing
at the end of the study.
Mean changes from screening to the
end of treatment in BDI-II scores for the
CBD, THCV, and 1:1 CBD/THCV treat-
ment groups were 0.85, 0.58, and 0.27
points, respectively, which were not
statistically significant from placebo
(change from baseline of 20.08 points),
and remained within the “minimal de-
pression” range for all treatments. The
largest change from baseline to the end
of treatment in BDI-II score was in the
20:1 CBD/THCV treatment group (4.91
points). Although this remained in the
“minimal depression” bracket, it was
statistically significant compared with
placebo (ETD = 4.77; P , 0.01).
Conclusions
The aim of this pilot study was to inves-
tigate the clinical effect and tolerability
of two phytocannabinoids, THCV and
CBD, alone and in combination, in subjects
with type 2 diabetes and dyslipidemia.
THCV significantly decreased fasting
plasma glucose, and increased b-cell
function, adiponectin, and Apo A con-
centrations, and was well tolerated in
patients. These findings suggest that
THCV may represent a new therapeutic

CBD and THCV in Humans With Type 2 Diabetes
Diabetes Care Volume 39, October 2016
 agent for glycemic control in subjects
with type 2 diabetes.
The ECS plays an important role in
modulating energy intake and expendi-
ture (for reviews, see Refs. 1,2), and a
chronically overactive ECS may have a
role in diabetes and its various compli-
cations (2). A recent cross-sectional
study showed that marijuana use was
associated with lower concentrations
of fasting insulin, insulin resistance,
and waist circumference (31). Some of
the favorable metabolic effects seen
with smoking cannabis may be due to
partial CB1 agonists like THC, which
may act as a functional antagonist in
conditions of increased endocannabi-
noid tonelike obesity, because of its
lower CB1 binding affinity and efficacy
in comparison with 2-AG, for which lev-
els are elevated in visceral obesity (32).
Rimonabant, a CB1 receptor antagonist,
was the first in its class to be used as
antiobesity drug, but led to significant
psychiatric AEs (5). Preclinical studies
with the plant-derived compound
THCV have shown that it produces hy-
pophagia and weight reduction in lean
mice (26) and improves glucose toler-
ance and insulin sensitivity in diet-
induced obese mice (27). Similar results
have been seen with CBD in ob/ob
mice (C.S., unpublished data), and CBD
has been reported to lower the in-
cidence of diabetes in nonobese dia-
betic mice (33) and arrest the onset
of autoimmune diabetes in nonobese
diabetic mice (34). Given the positive
metabolic effects of both THCV and
CBD in preclinical studies and their po-
tent anti-inflammatory and antioxidant
properties (20,35,36), we decided to in-
vestigate, for the first time, their efficacy
and tolerability in subjects with type 2
diabetes.
THCV Alone
THCV treatment alone had no effect on
HDL-C concentration. It did, however,
produce a significant rise in serum Apo
A, when compared with placebo. Apo A
makes up 90% of HDL protein and con-
stitutes an important structural compo-
nent of the HDL particle. Apo A I, which
accounts for 70% of the Apo A (the re-
maining 20% accounted for by Apo A II),
plays an important role in reverse cho-
lesterol transport (37). The significance
of this result remains unclear.
THCV significantly reduced fasting
blood glucose concentrations, improved
HOMA2 b-cell function, and improved
the 3-h blood glucose response to OGTT,
without any significant difference in in-
sulin response. These findings are in
keeping with the recent animal data, in
which THCV improved fasting glucose
and 30-min glucose response to OGTT
and also improved insulin sensitivity by
reducing fasting and post–glucose insu-
lin concentrations (27). In the same
study, THCV treatment improved insu-
lin-induced phosphorylation of Akt (also
known as protein kinase B) in insulin-
resistant human hepatocytes and mice
myotubes, suggesting improved insulin
signaling as one of the possible mech-
anisms of action.
Although there was an improvement
in fasting and 3-h post-OGTT blood glu-
cose, there were no changes in body
weight and gut hormone concentra-
tions. In fact, a rise in the concentration
of RBP-4 was observed with THCV, an
adipokine that has been associated with
obesity and insulin resistance (38).
Therefore, the mechanism by which
THCV improves glycemic control remains
unclear.
THCV significantly increased adipo-
nectin concentrations. Adiponectin
enhances hepatic insulin sensitivity, in-
creases fatty acid oxidation, and has im-
portant antiatherogenic properties. Its
concentrations are reduced in obesity
and type 2 diabetes (39).
Positive metabolic effects of THCV on
glycemic control and adiponectin con-
centrations were also seen with rimona-
bant, the first CB1 antagonist to be
licensed as antiobesity medication that
was later withdrawn from market due to
increased incidence of psychiatric AEs
(5). It is, however, important to empha-
size that although rimonabant consis-
tently reduced body weight in all the
reported randomized clinical trials, no
such change was seen with THCV, sug-
gesting clear differences in the mecha-
nisms of action of these compounds.
Recent animal data with THCV similarly
showed no effect on body weight (27).
Figure 2—Compared with placebo, THCV alone caused a significant improvement in the concentration of Apo A (A) and adiponectin (B). Data were
analyzed by ANCOVA and presented as mean 6 SEM. CBD caused a significant reduction in resistin (C) and an increase in GIP concentration (D), when
compared with pretreatment values. Data were analyzed post hoc using paired t test and presented as mean 6 SEM. BID, twice daily. *P , 0.05;
**P , 0.01.

 Moreover, rimonabant improved the
lipid profile (increased HDL-C and re-
duced TG levels), whereas THCV had no
effect on lipid parameters in our study
(4). There is also a clear difference in
chemical structure between THCV and
rimonabant. It is therefore reasonable
to believe that THCV and rimonabant
have different pharmacological and
safety profiles. At micromolar concen-
trations, THCV inhibits the activity of
both fatty acid amide hydrolase and
monoacyl glycerol lipase, thereby inhib-
iting the hydrolysis of AEA and 2-AG, re-
spectively (40). THCV, therefore, can act
as an indirect agonist at the cannabinoid
receptors, by enhancing the activity of
the ECS. Because such a change was
not seen in our study, it is reasonable
to believe that, at the dose tested,
THCV was unable to modulate the ECS.
Recent animal data from Wargent et al.
(27) showed that most of the positive
metabolic effects of THCV were seen
with 5 and 12.5 mg/kg doses given orally
in rodents. In comparison with this, the
dose used on our study (10 mg/day, ;0.1
mg/kg in humans) was much lower.
CBD Alone
Although CBD did not produce any ef-
fects on the primary and secondary effi-
cacy outcomes compared with placebo,
it reduced circulating resistin concentra-
tions from baseline, while increasing
the concentration of circulating GIP.
Increased concentrations of resistin are
associated with obesity and insulin re-
sistance (41). GIP is one of the incretin
hormones produced by K cells in the
proximal duodenum, which is known
to have insulinotropic and pancreatic
b-cell–preserving properties (42). De-
spite having positive effects on resistin
and GIP, CBD did not produce any im-
provement in glycemic control.
CBD is known for its indirect agonism
at the CB1 receptors, by either increasing
CB1 constitutional activity or the endo-
cannabinoid tone. CBD has been reported
to inhibit hydrolysis of AEA by fatty acid
amide hydrolase (but only at high micro-
molar levels) and also increases 2-AG
levels (39). In a recent clinical study, in
subjects with schizophrenia, 800 mg/day
Figure 3—Compared with placebo, THCV alone caused significant improvement in fasting glucose (A), and in keeping with this, there was a highly
significant improvement in b-cell function measured by HOMA2 (B). THCV caused significant improvement in 3-h glucose response during OGTT (C),
when compared with pretreatment values. Data were analyzed using two-way ANOVA and presented as mean 6 SEM. D: Compared with pre-
treatment values, there was a highly significant improvement in 3-h glucose response to OGTT with THCV, when subjects on any oral hypoglycemic
therapy other than diet and/or metformin were excluded from analysis (n = 6). In the same subgroup (analyzed post hoc), compared with placebo,
there was a statistically significant improvement in HbA1c (E). Data were analyzed post hoc using repeated-measures two-way ANOVA and paired
t test, respectively, and presented as mean 6 SEM. BID, twice daily. *P , 0.05; **P , 0.01.

CBD and THCV in Humans With Type 2 Diabetes
Diabetes Care Volume 39, October 2016
 of CBD treatment significantly increased
serum AEA levels and was associated
with an improvement in clinical profile
of these subjects (12). In our study, CBD
(albeit at a much lower dose), alone or in
combination with THCV, had no effect on
the plasma levels of endocannabinoids,
suggesting that it had minimal interaction
with the ECS at the doses investigated.
Studies in rodents have used intraper-
itoneal CBD in a dose ranging from
1 mg/kg/day to 20 mg/kg/day, with pos-
itive effects on the metabolism seen only
with higher dose ranges (7–9). In a 70-kg
individual, a 20 mg/kg/day dose equates
to 1,400 mg/day. Similarly, human studies
haveused CBDin higher doses (12,43).The
dose used in our study was 200 mg/day,
which could possibly explain lack of thera-
peutic effects seen with CBD.
Combination of CBD and THCV
Except for an improvement in CGIC as-
sessments with 1:1 CBD/THCV treat-
ment, none of the efficacy parameters
were affected by 1:1 or 20:1 combina-
tion of CBD and THCV. There was a trend
toward an improvement in most lipid
parameters and the overall incidence
of all-causality treatment-related AEs
was lowest in the 1:1 CBD/THCV treat-
ment group; these factors could have
led to an impression of improvement
in subjects’ overall condition with this
treatment. Although the combination
of CBD and THCV did not produce any
favorable effects on any of the parame-
ters, the favorable effects of THCV were
also lost in the combination treatment.
Similarly,thepositiveeffectsofCBDon GIP
and resistin were not seen in any of the
combination treatments. This suggests
that CBD and THCV in combination may
counteract their individual therapeutic ef-
fects at least in the ratios and doses tested
in this study. This may be at the level of
receptors or due to interference with each
other’s metabolism or therapeutic half-life
and requires further investigation.
Safety
Both CBD and THCV were well tolerated,
with the majority of patients experienc-
ing AEs that were mild in severity. The
most common AE was reduced appetite
with similar incidence across all of the
treatment groups. There were no reports
of depression and no clinically significant
abnormalities on electrocardiogram and
laboratory results, including blood count
and liver and renal biochemistry, in any
treatment groups. There was one SAE of
myocardial ischemia in the placebo group
andoneSAEofmyocardialinfarctioninthe
20:1 CBD/THCV group; both were consid-
ered unrelated to study medication. With
regards to the BDI-II scale, although the
change in 20:1 CBD/THCV treatment
group was statistically significant, all
mean active treatments and placebo
scores remained in the “minimal depres-
sion” range.
CONCLUSIONS
In this clinical study, the first to study
the effects of CBD and THCV in subjects
with type 2 diabetes and dyslipidemia,
THCV improved glycemic control and
therefore warrants further investigation
in this therapeutic area. CBD failed to
show any detectable metabolic effects
despite producing desirable changes in
some adipokines and gut hormone con-
centrations. The incidence of AEs was
similar between treatment groups, and
both CBD and THCV were well tolerated.
No new safety concerns were identified
in the study.
