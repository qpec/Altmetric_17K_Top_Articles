IMPORTANCE Quality improvement (QI) interventions can reduce hospital readmission, but
little is known about their economic value.
OBJECTIVE To systematically review economic evaluations of QI interventions designed to
reduce readmissions.
DATA SOURCES Databases searched included PubMed, Econlit, the Centre for Reviews
& Dissemination Economic Evaluations, New York Academy of Medicine'
s Grey Literature
Report, and Worldcat (January 2004 to July 2016).
STUDY SELECTION Dual reviewers selected English-language studies from high-income
countries that evaluated organizational or structural changes to reduce hospital readmission,
and that reported program and readmission-related costs.
DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS Dual reviewers extracted intervention characteristics,
study design, clinical effectiveness, study quality, economic perspective, and costs. We
calculated the risk difference and net costs to the health system in 2015 US dollars. Weighted
least-squares regression analyses tested predictors of the risk difference and net costs.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Main outcomes measures included the risk difference in
readmission rates and incremental net cost. This systematic review and data analysis is
reported in accordance with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and
Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines.
RESULTS Of 5205 articles, 50 unique studies were eligible, including 25 studies in populations
limited to heart failure (HF) that included 5768 patients, 21 in general populations that
included 10 445 patients, and 4 in unique populations. Fifteen studies lasted up to 30 days
while most others lasted 6 to 24 months. Based on regression analyses, readmissions
declined by an average of 12.1% among patients with HF (95% CI, 8.3%-15.9%; P < .001;
based on 22 studies with complete data) and by 6.3% among general populations (95% CI,
4.0%-8.7%; P < .001; 18 studies). The mean net savings to the health system per patient was
$972 among patients with HF (95% CI, −$642 to $2586; P = .23; 24 studies), and the mean
net loss was $169 among general populations (95% CI, −$2610 to $2949; P = .90; 21 studies),
reflecting nonsignificant differences. Among general populations, interventions that engaged
patients and caregivers were associated with greater net savings ($1714 vs −$6568;
P = .006).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Multicomponent QI interventions can be effective at reducing
readmissions relative to the status quo, but net costs vary. Interventions that engage general
populations of patients and their caregivers may offer greater value to the health system, but
the implications for patients and caregivers are unknown.

eing hospitalized once puts patients at risk for being
hospitalized again, and readmissions are costly. His-
torically, about 15% to 21% of older adults were rehos-
pitalized within 30 days, and 20% to 48% within a year.1-5 In-
dividuals with heart failure (HF) are at even higher risk, with
26% to 50% being readmitted within 30 days and 68% to 78%
within a year.4,6-13 Following the Hospital Readmission Re-
duction Program in 2012, 30-day readmissions have declined
among older Medicare beneficiaries, including those with
HF.14,15 Nonetheless, in 2013, 3.9 million 30-day readmis-
sions occurred nationwide across all payers, including 183 000
HF readmissions, at a cost of $52.4 billion.16
To reduce readmissions, hospitals and health systems can
implement quality improvement (QI) interventions. Readmis-
sions occurring within the first week after discharge are often
related to the stress of acute illness as well as heightened self-
care needs, new medications, and impaired function,5,17,18
while those occurring later reflect chronic illness.5 Accord-
ingly, some QI interventions include practices that are imple-
mented around the time of discharge, while others are main-
tained longer term.19-21
Multifaceted QI interventions can be effective, but nei-
ther the cost of implementation nor the potential savings as-
sociated with declines in hospitalization have been system-
aticallyevaluated.19,22Furthermore,itremainsunclearwhether
effective interventions tend to produce net savings or losses
to the health system.
Our objective was to systematically evaluate the clinical
effectiveness and incremental net costs of QI interventions for
the prevention of readmission to acute care hospitals, includ-
ing within 30 days and over longer periods. We searched peer-
reviewed and non–peer-reviewed literature. We then exam-
ined the types of interventions studied, clinical effectiveness,
associated costs, and the quality of the economic evalua-
tions. Finally, we examined factors associated with effective-
ness and costs.

Data Sources and Searches
A reference librarian (R.S.) developed search terms related to
readmission, and expanded on published terms related to
economic evaluation (see eAppendices 1-6 and eReferences
in the Supplement).25 Databases included PubMed, Econlit,
and the Centre for Reviews & Dissemination Economic
Evaluations. To identify gray literature, we searched New
York Academy of Medicine's Grey Literature Report and
Worldcat and invited technical expert panel members to
suggest non–peer-reviewed analyses. Searches were
restricted to English-language documents from January
2004 to July 2016. We hand-searched citations from previ-
ous systematic reviews and other sources.19,20,26-29
Study Selection
Studies were eligible if they represented original investiga-
tions, applied QI interventions designed to prevent readmis-
sion, measured or modeled the cost of the interventions, and
compared alternatives. Studies had to report both program
costs (costs of implementation) and readmission-related costs.
Weexcludedstudiesfromlow-tomiddle-incomecountriesow-
ing to differences in care practices and cost structures.30 All
diagnoses, clinical study designs, economic evaluation ap-
proaches, and time horizons were eligible. A QI intervention
was “an effort to change/improve the clinical structure, pro-
cess, or outcomes of care by means of an organizational or
structural change.
”31(p280) Readmissions had to be the main fo-
cus (eg, studies that focused on length of stay but monitored
readmissions were excluded), and patients had to be enrolled
during or immediately after hospitalization. Two trained re-
viewers (T.K.N. and E.K.) independently examined titles, ab-
stracts, and full-text publications to determine eligibility; dis-
crepancies were resolved by consensus, or, when necessary,
through discussion with the research team.
Data Extraction, Quality Assessment, and Data Synthesis
We obtained any additional publications related to each study,
and then pairs of investigators extracted data from the ar-
ticles.Discrepancieswereresolvedbyconsensus,or,whennec-
essary, through discussion with the research team.

practices.19,20 To facilitate comparisons across studies, we ag-
gregatedthese15categoriesinto5groupsbasedonthepurpose

Key Points
Question Are quality improvement interventions designed to
reduce hospital readmissions associated with net savings to the
health system?
Findings In this systematic review and data analysis of economic
evaluations based on data for more than 16 700 patients, hospital
readmissions declined by an average of 12.1% among populations
with heart failure and 6.3% among general populations, but net
savings to the health system were variable. In general populations,
interventions that involved engaging patients and caregivers were
associated with similar effectiveness but substantially larger net
savings to the health system than other interventions.
Meaning Diverse interventions can be effective at reducing
readmissions, but cost savings do not consistently occur.
Interventions that engage patients and family members may be
associated with larger net savings.

 Clinical Evaluation
For each eligible study, investigators extracted data related to
context,population,design,andreportingoftheclinicalevalu-
ation, time frame(s), outcome measure(s), numbers of indi-
viduals and outcomes in intervention and comparison groups,
and funding sources. Contextual variables included country,
academic status, setting, and readmission rate in the control
group. We stratified studies into populations that were lim-
ited to HF, general populations, and other unique popula-
tions. Clinical study designs included randomized clinical trial
(RCT), non-RCT, controlled before-after analysis; uncon-
trolled before-after analysis, interrupted time series and re-
peated measures study, and modeling exercise.32 To assess po-
tential bias, we used the Cochrane Collaboration Tool for RCTs
and the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale for cohort studies.33,34 We
scored selected elements from the Minimum Quality Criteria
Set (items 3-7, 10-11, and 13), a tool for critically appraising the
reporting of QI interventions.35 Funding sources included gov-
ernment, nonprofit, commercial, and none.
The clinical outcome was the risk difference, meaning the
change in the readmission rate, calculated by subtracting the
percentage of patients who were readmitted in the interven-
tiongroupfromthepercentagereadmittedinthecontrolgroup.
When studies reported clinical outcomes for more than 1 time
frame, we prioritized the time frame that matched costs and
the duration of the intervention. When studies reported more
than 1 outcome measure, we prioritized the number of pa-
tients with all-cause readmissions, unplanned readmissions,
condition-related readmissions, and then such measures re-
ported together with deaths.
Economic Evaluation
Investigators with training in economic evaluation extracted
the approach (cost analyses including cost-consequences and
business-case analyses vs cost-effectiveness, cost-benefit, and
related analyses); perspective (hospital, health system, payer,
society); time horizon; discount rate (if applicable); year and
currency of costs; resources involved in implementation; and
incremental program, readmission-related, and net costs.
Theeconomicoutcomewastheincrementalnetcosttothe
health system per enrolled patient (“net cost”), calculated by
summing incremental program and readmission-related costs
and converting all costs to 2015 US dollars. To identify rel-
evant categories of costs, we used the Quality-Cost
Framework.36 Together, structure- and process-related costs
comprised an intervention’s total program costs. Structure-
related costs were the fixed costs associated with start-up and
maintenance, such as labor costs associated with creating new
protocols and training clinicians. Process-related costs were
variable, recurring costs resulting from the care of individual
patients,suchasthecostofhomevisits.Outcome-relatedcosts
included health care expenditures related to outcomes, in-
cluding readmission.
Reviewersassessedwhethereconomicevaluationsmetba-
sic standards by applying a modified version of the Quality of
Health Economics Studies Checklist (mQHES).37,38 We di-
vided each question into subparts for easier scoring and added
2 questions related to the adequacy of competing alterna-
tivesandcredibilityoftheanalysisoverall.Tocalculatethetotal
mQHES score (scale, 0-115) for each study, we determined the
percentage of “yes” responses to subparts of each question,
weightedeachquestion’srawscore,andsummedtheweighted
values.
Statistical Analysis
Calculating the risk difference and net cost separately (ie, con-
ducting a cost-consequences analysis) for each study en-
abled us to perform 2 sets of prespecified weighted least-
squares regression analyses that assessed potential predictors
of these outcomes. We chose the weighted least-squares ap-
proach (which weights studies by number of participants) over
a random effects approach (which weights studies by the in-
verse of variance) because the 2 methods yield equivalent re-
sults, weighted least-squares models perform as well or bet-
ter when there may be publication bias or small sample sizes,39
studies did not report data related to variance for cost esti-
mates so the random effects approach was infeasible for that
outcome, and using a single analytical method for both out-
comes was less complex.
We stratified both the risk difference and net cost analy-
ses by populations limited to HF and general populations, ex-
cluding studies of other unique populations. A regression
model was fitted for each independent variable separately, in-
cluding the readmission rate in the control group (continu-
ous),interventiontimehorizon(<30or≥30days),programcost
per patient (continuous), and practices included in the QI in-
tervention. We examined the number of individual practices
per study, the number of groups of practices per study (both

ate regression.
Results
Study Selection
We identified 5205 articles, selecting 401 for full-text review;
48 articles met all eligibility criteria. One article reported re-
sults separately for medical and surgical patients, while an-
other tested 2 variations on an intervention. We report these
separately, yielding 50 unique studies. See eFigure in the
Supplement for PRISMA Diagram and eTables 2 to 6 in the
Supplement for data extracted from the studies.
Study Characteristics and Quality Assessment
Classification of QI Interventions
Nearly all studies involved supplementing care by usual cli-
nicians, and most involved assessing patients’ risks or needs,
engaging patients or caregivers, and undertaking steps to con-
nect patients to their usual clinicians. Medication reconcilia-
tion was not as common, particularly among populations with
HF (Table 1, eTables 2-6 in the Supplement).
Population and Context
Twenty-five studies were limited to patients with HF and to-
getherincluded5768patients.6-13,40-56Twenty-onestudiesap-
plied to general populations, largely older adults and to-
gether included 10 445 patients.1,57-74 Four studies applied to
unique populations.2,3,75,76
Twenty-ninestudieswerebasedintheUnitedStates,while
the rest were in other nations. eTables 2 to 6 in the Supplement
include setting and academic status.
Clinical Evaluation
Thirty-three studies were RCTs, 7 were non-RCTs, 5 used con-
trolled before-after designs, 3 used uncontrolled before-after
designs, and 2 were modeling exercises. All studies com-
pared QI interventions with a status quo scenario. Among the
non-RCTs, 3 compared patients who opted in vs those who
opted out, and 2 did not report methods of allocation.
Thirty-nine studies reported all-cause readmissions, 2 un-
planned readmissions, 6 condition-related readmissions, 2 all-
causereadmissionsordeath,and1readmissionthatinvolvedin-
tensive care among patients with life-limiting illness. Three
reported complete data for all-cause and condition-related re-
admissions(withsimilarresultsforeffectivenessandcosts).Most

 studiesreportednumbersofpatientswithreadmissions;5stud-
ies reported only numbers of readmissions per patient.
See eTables 2 to 6 in the Supplement for risk of bias assess-
ments, funding sources, and items from the Minimum Quality
Data Set. Many studies were at risk for bias owing to the possi-
bility of incomplete outcome data or loss to follow-up.
Economic Evaluation
Forty-four of the studies were cost analyses, whereas 6 were
cost-effectiveness or cost-benefit analyses. Forty-two stud-
ies considered the health system perspective, 1 considered the
hospital perspective, 3 used the payer perspective, 1 used both
the hospital and health system perspectives, and 3 consid-
ered the societal perspective. Overall, economic evaluation
methods met basic standards, with a median mQHES score of
99.3 (interquartile range, 10.8) across the 50 studies.
Figure 1, shows program costs, readmissions-related costs,
andnetcostsforeachstudyinpopulationslimitedtoHF,where
negative costs reflect savings. Program costs were negative in
1study,meaningthattheinterventionsavedmoneyevenwith-
out a change in readmissions: home care services were pro-
vided more efficiently in the intervention group.56 Program
costs were smaller than savings from reduced readmissions in
most studies, leading to net savings. However, net financial
losses occurred in 5 studies. In 1 of these studies, both read-
missions and costs rose.52 In another, readmissions declined
but length of stay increased in the intervention group.53 In a
modeling analysis from the United Kingdom, readmissions de-
clinedbutthecostperreadmissionwaslow,leadingtonetcosts
rather than savings.54 Finally, program costs were particu-
larly high in 2 studies,6 including 1 in which readmissions did
not decline.55
For general and other unique populations (Figure 2), pro-
gram costs were negative in 2 studies: 1 study provided inpa-
tient care more efficiently through an acute care for elderly pa-
tients unit,70 and the other study improved the management
of percutaneous gastrostomy tubes such that the need for care
at home declined.3 Net costs rose in 4 studies: both readmis-
sions and costs climbed in 1 study,71 while costs per hospital-
ization rose in 3 studies, including 1 among surgical
patients.72-74 See eTable 7 in the Supplement for data used to
standardize costs.
Statistical Analysis
Risk Difference
Among patients with HF, the weighted mean percentage of pa-
tients who were readmitted during the study period (lasting a
median of 197 days) was 50.0% in the control group and 37.9%
in the intervention group, based on 22 studies with complete
data. This corresponds to a risk difference of 12.1% (95% CI,
8.3%-15.9%; P < .001) (Table 2). Larger investments in pro-
gram costs were associated with modestly reduced effective-

 tices, was associated with effectiveness. Results were un-
changed by limiting the analysis to the 12 RCTs.
Incremental Net Cost
The mean net cost to the health system per patient with HF
was −$972 (95% CI, −$2586 to $642; P = .23), reflecting non-
significantnetsavings,basedon24studieswithcompletedata
(Table 3). Net costs declined with increasing effectiveness
(P < .001), such that an absolute 1% increase in the risk differ-
ence was associated with $342 greater savings. Time horizon,
readmission rate in the control group, other readmission-
related practices, and mQHES score were not associated with
net costs. Findings were similar when limiting the analysis to
17 RCTs.
For general populations, the mean net cost was $169 (95%
CI, −$2610 to $2949; P = .90), reflecting nonsignificant net
losses. When interventions involved engaging patients and
caregivers, net costs were $8282 lower than when they did not
do so (−$1714 vs $6568; P = .006). Program costs, interven-
tioneffectiveness,andmQHESscoreswerenotassociatedwith
net costs. In a sensitivity analysis limited to 12 RCTs, $100
higher program costs were associated with $261 greater sav-
ings (P = .009).
Discussion
In this systematic review and meta-analysis of 50 economic
evaluationsthatincludeddataonmorethan16700patients,mul-
tifaceted QI interventions reduced all-cause hospital readmis-
sionsbutdidnotconsistentlyyieldnetsavingstothehealthsys-
tem. Thirty percent of the studied interventions lasted 14 to 30
days,thetimeframeconsideredbytheMedicareHospitalRead-
missions Reduction Program, while the remainder generally
lasted for 6 months or longer. The percentage of patients read-
mitted within study time frames declined by 12.1% among
patientswithHF(from50.0%)andby6.3%amonggeneralpopu-
lations (from 22.4%). On average, QI interventions were associ-
atedwithnonsignificantnetsavingsof$972amongpatientswith
HFandnonsignificantnetlossesof$169ingeneralpopulations.
Overall, net losses occurred in 20% of studies.
Neither prior literature nor our analysis provides clear an-
swers about which practices are most effective at reducing re-
admissions. In a 2014 meta-analysis19 of 42 RCTs targeting 30-
day readmissions, the pooled risk ratio (RR) was 0.82 (95% CI,
0.73-0.91).Thisreflectsan18%relativedecline,whichisslightly
lower than the 23% to 28% relative decline (ie, risk difference
divided by baseline rate) that we observed. In the 2014 analy-
sis, interventions that supported patient capacity for self-
care were more effective, which is similar to the concept of en-
gagingpatientsandcaregivers.Wefoundthatengagingpatients
and caregivers was associated with greater net savings among
general populations but not among patients with HF. In a 2014
meta-analysis77 of 47 RCTs of HF interventions that lasted 3
to 6 months, all-cause readmissions declined with multidis-
ciplinaryclinics(pooledRR,0.70,95%CI0.55–0.89)andhome-
visiting programs (RR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.68-0.86), while HF-
related readmissions declined with structured telephone
support (RR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.61-0.90). In a 2015 Cochrane
review78 of 41 RCTs, telemonitoring over 3 to 26 months (RR,
0.71;95%CI,0.60-0.83)andstructuredtelephonesupportover
3 to 18 months (RR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.77-0.93) reduced HF-
related but not all-cause readmissions. We may have de-
tected fewer differences in effectiveness across readmission-
relatedpracticesbecausewefocusedonall-causereadmissions
and because the interventions that have been subjected to eco-
nomic evaluation tended to use similar types of QI practices.
Both effectiveness and costs are important to assessing
value.22 Thirty-day readmissions are in decline among Medi-
care beneficiaries but, until now, little systematically devel-
oped information has existed on the cost of the QI interven-
tions that may be contributing to these trends. The costs
reported in our analysis reflect the health system perspec-
tive, which encompasses costs borne by hospitals, physi-
cians, other clinicians, and public and private payers. Yet
financial implications differ across stakeholders. Under fee-
for-service payment systems, hospitals and inpatient physi-
cians invest labor and other resources before discharge, and
outpatient physicians, home health agencies, and skilled nurs-
ing facilities do so after. Public and private payers are the pri-
mary recipients of any savings when readmissions decline. For
example,Medicareisexpectedtosave$8.2billionfromavoided
readmissions under the Hospital Readmissions Reduction
Program.79 This does not include the program costs associ-
ated with QI interventions, however, because these are not
borne by Medicare.
Among general populations, we found that interventions
that engaged patient and caregivers offered considerably
greater value because, while clinical effectiveness was the
same,netsavingsperpatientwere$8282larger(P = .006).Such
interventions enhance the capacity for self-management, de-
creasing unnecessary reliance on the health care system. How-
ever, they also inherently increase investments of labor by pa-
tients and caregivers. Patient and caregiver opinions of these
interventions, and the value of their time, were not consid-
ered by studies in this analysis.
Is implementing QI interventions to reduce readmissions
is a good value? On the one hand, the interventions are gen-
erally effective and cost neutral to cost saving to the health sys-
tem. Our data suggest that preventing 1 more readmission
among 100 intervention enrollees with HF would, on aver-
age, yield net savings of $34 200. On the other hand, hospital
readmissions only indirectly reflect patient health outcomes.
Many readmissions are in the patients’ best interests and not
avoidable. To fully assess value, a cost-effectiveness analysis
wouldneedtobeperformedfromthesocietalperspective,con-
sidering health-related quality of life and other implications
for patients and caregivers.

domized designs. Although most studies reported all-cause re-
admissions,someusedothermeasures.Manystudieswereatrisk

Conclusions
Multicomponent QI interventions that are designed to
reduce readmissions after hospital discharge are generally
effective relative to the status quo, but net savings to health
system perspective are uncertain owing to heterogeneity in
results across studies. Interventions that engage general
populations of patients and their family members may be of
higher value to the health system than other interventions
because they are associated with similar effectiveness and
substantially higher net savings. However, the burden of
these interventions to patients and caregivers has not been
quantified.
