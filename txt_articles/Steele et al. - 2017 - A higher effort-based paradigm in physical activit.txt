Abstract
It is well known that physical activity and exercise is associated with a lower risk of a range of morbidities and
all-cause mortality. Further, it appears that risk reductions are greater when physical activity and/or exercise is
performed at a higher intensity of effort. Why this may be the case is perhaps explained by the accumulating
evidence linking physical fitness and performance outcomes (e.g. cardiorespiratory fitness, strength, and muscle
mass) also to morbidity and mortality risk. Current guidelines about the performance of moderate/vigorous physical
activity using aerobic exercise modes focuses upon the accumulation of a minimum volume of physical activity
and/or exercise, and have thus far produced disappointing outcomes. As such there has been increased interest in
the use of higher effort physical activity and exercise as being potentially more efficacious. Though there is
currently debate as to the effectiveness of public health prescription based around higher effort physical activity
and exercise, most discussion around this has focused upon modes considered to be traditionally ‘aerobic’ (e.g.
running, cycling, rowing, swimming etc.). A mode customarily performed to a relatively high intensity of effort that
we believe has been overlooked is resistance training. Current guidelines do include recommendations to engage
in ‘muscle strengthening activities’ though there has been very little emphasis upon these modes in either research
or public health effort. As such the purpose of this debate article is to discuss the emerging higher effort paradigm
in physical activity and exercise for public health and to make a case for why there should be a greater emphasis
placed upon resistance training as a mode in this paradigm shift.

Background
It is hard to argue against the value of physical activity
and/or exercise for health and longevity. Engaging in
these behaviors is associated with a reduced risk of all-
cause mortality [1, 2], and a dose-response relationship
appears to exist between increasing volume (i.e., amount
or duration) of physical activity and exercise engaged in
and reduced mortality risk [3–5]. As a result most guide-
lines regarding physical activity and exercise are based
upon the accumulation of a minimum volume (i.e. a
combination of 30 min of moderate intensity [50–70%
of maximum heart rate (MHR)] five times per week
AND/OR 20 min of vigorous intensity [70–80% MHR]
three times per week).
However, the efficacy of these recommendations could
be considered disappointing in view of recent studies
showing that only a marginal reduction in morbidity risk
factors and all-cause mortality occurs when they are met
[6, 7]. In contrast, the intensity of effort (i.e. relative
challenge) of physical activity and exercise may be a
more impactful moderator of risk reduction than exer-
cise volume [8, 9]. Although a combined approach (i.e.,

 higher volumes of low effort exercise combined with
lower volumes of high effort exercise) may offer the
most benefit, in isolation, engaging in higher effort phys-
ical activity and exercise would appear most impactful
[10]. It is important to note that most evidence for the
benefits of physical activity and exercise comes from ob-
servational studies and that evidence is mixed amongst
randomised controlled trials and systematic reviews [11].
Despite this uncertainty, it is worth considering why the
observational evidence seems to support engagement in
higher effort exercise as being more efficacious com-
pared with lower effort yet higher volume approaches.
Evidence is accumulating that poor performance in fit-
ness related measures, across the lifespan, may be some
of the strongest risk factors for quality of life, function,
and increased risk of a range of morbidities, as well as
increased all-cause mortality. The now classic work of
Blair et al. [12] reported that cardiorespiratory fitness is
a stronger predictor of mortality than even smoking.
More
recent
studies
support
similar
relationships
between health, longevity, and cardiorespiratory fitness
[6, 7, 13–19], in addition to other characteristics notably
modifiable through physical activity and exercise such as
muscle mass [20, 21], and strength [22–32]. Considering
that these variables (cardiorespiratory fitness, strength
and muscle mass) are strong predictors of morbidity and
mortality, from the perspective of an exercise physiolo-
gist, it might appear unsurprising that higher effort
physical activity and exercise also appears to be a strong
predictor compared with higher volume, lower effort
physical activity and exercise. The use of exercise inter-
ventions with high intensity of effort has shown promis-
ing efficacy in improving outcomes for a range of
cardiometabolic diseases, and may also be superior to
moderate intensity of effort programmes at improving
outcomes such as cardiorespiratory fitness [33–35].
Indeed, in an experimental examination of the current
aerobic physical activity guidelines, Church et al. [36]
had groups of participants perform varying volumes of
exercise. Participants exercised at an average of ~3.6METs,
considered ‘moderate’ activity. Even in the group ex-
ceeding the volume of the current guidelines by 50%
there was minimal to no effect on a range of risk factors
for coronary heart disease, including cardiorespiratory
fitness [36].
A paradigm shift is beginning with many now discuss-
ing exercise prescription for public health based on an
effort driven model (i.e., the prescription of exercise at
higher or near maximal relative efforts), and thus a
wider range of exercise options to increase reach to a
broader and more representative portion of the popula-
tion. This is evident by the fact that the concept is being
taken seriously enough to be the subject of debate at
international conferences [37], in addition to the increasing
number of studies being funded and published examining
the applications of higher intensity of effort interventions
for an increasing range of conditions. However, most of
the focus around this area has been primarily upon what
are often colloquially termed ‘cardio’ exercise modalities
(i.e. locomotive based modes such as cycling, running,
rowing, incline walking, and stairclimbing). Indeed, though
an effort driven model opens up options for exercise, a
mode which the authors of this paper believe has been
underappreciated and received less discussion in the wider
field of physical activity and exercise for public health is
resistance training (RT).
Resistance training for public health
RT is a modality of exercise that has existed in many
forms. As early as 480 BC Greek soldiers engaged in a
form of RT, often referred to as calisthenics, using their
bodyweight to provide resistance during exercise. The
use of calisthenics based RT reached a peak in the early
nineteenth century with the various gymnastic schools,
most notably the Swedish school of Per Henrick Ling.
The notion of applying progression to RT by using in-
creasingly heavier forms of external resistance finds its
origins in the myth of Milo of Croton who was said to
have carried a bull across his shoulders after having
lifted it as a new-born calf every day until its maturity.
Free weights, such as barbells and dumbbells, are a type
of external resistance with which most are familiar
today, and the modern adjustable incarnations of these
implements came into popularity through the Milo
Barbell company, founded by Alan Calvert in 1902. Ma-
chines to provide adjustable external resistance are now
also commonplace in most gyms and fitness centres.
The first designs for such devices are credited to Gustav
Zander in the late nineteenth century, though their re-
surgence and current popularity find their source in the
Nautilus Sport/Medical Industries Company founded by
Arthur Jones in the 1970s. Many varied forms of RT
exist nowadays, the list above not being exhaustive, yet
there are some key defining characteristics of how RT is
commonly recommended and applied that characterise
and differentiate it from other exercise modes. These in-
clude repeated or sustained muscular actions against
some form of resistance, at a relatively high effort, for a
relatively brief duration, and relatively infrequently. Not-
ably RT improves both strength and muscle mass with
effort being a primary determinant of these outcomes
[38, 39]. Moreover, RT may also improve cardiorespira-
tory fitness, particularly if performed to a high enough
intensity of effort [40].
Evidence has accumulated that suggests that engaging
in some form of muscle strengthening activity, such as
RT, has an impact on a range of health and morbidity re-
lated risk factors [41–45], multi-morbidity risk [46, 47],
Steele et al. BMC Public Health  (2017) 17:300 
Page 2 of 8
 and all-cause mortality [48–50], across both healthy and
clinical populations. However, a question remains as to
how important a place RT should have in current phys-
ical activity and exercise guidelines for public health.
Within the academic literature numerous authors have
argued that RT should have a more prominent place
within guidelines [51–53]. In fact, most current activity
guidelines around the world already include recommen-
dations to engage in some form of muscle strengthening
activity at least twice per week [54–58]. Despite this, as
Strain et al. [59] noted recently, these are more often
than not the ‘forgotten’ portion of the guidelines. How-
ever, in addition to the lack of focus in public health pol-
icy, we have further concerns with the current state of
these recommendations, particularly from the perspec-
tive of RT as a higher effort mode of exercise. Recom-
mendations for what constitutes a muscle strengthening
activity, considering the potential importance of high ef-
fort in moderating efficacy, could be considered as insuf-
ficient except in the most unfit of persons. For example,
the UK National Health Service recommends the follow-
ing: lifting weights, working with resistance bands, doing
exercises that use your own bodyweight, such as push-
ups and sit-ups, heavy gardening such as digging and
shovelling, and yoga. The first three of these examples
would likely be considered to meet our conceptualisa-
tion of RT as a relatively high effort activity. Neverthe-
less, the inclusion of low resistance, and thus possibly
lower effort activities, such as gardening and yoga, could
be considered questionable. Though Ekblom-Bak et al.
[60] have reported that non-exercise physical activities
(NEPA) such as gardening, home/car maintenance, and
housework may contribute to improved health and lon-
gevity independent of other directed exercise, their
examination of NEPA was based on frequency of partici-
pation and included a range of activities that might vary
in both volume and intensity of effort. Others have re-
ported that many, and in particular women, consider do-
mestic activities to contribute to their moderate to
vigorous physical activity, yet such activities are nega-
tively associated with body composition, suggesting they
may be insufficient in providing the benefits normally
associated with physical activity and exercise [61]. Con-
sidering yoga, though participation may be efficacious in
older adults [62, 63], possibly due to it requiring a
greater relative intensity of effort in this population, a re-
cent study found that after adjusting for age, yoga par-
ticipation was not associated with a reduced all-cause
mortality risk [64]. Again, this might be attributed to
yoga presenting an insufficient stimulus with regards to
effort in many populations. In fact, studies which have
compared groups completing RT based interventions to
control groups performing a range of low effort exer-
cises, including yoga, report significant improvements in
most health and fitness related outcomes for RT, yet lit-
tle to no change in controls [65, 66]. Further, these stud-
ies were in disabled, older, female cardiac patients where
activities such as yoga might be considered to present a
relatively greater effort than in most persons.
Merely ‘going through the motions’ by participating in
some of the suggested muscle strengthening activities
may not produce the desired outcomes. Yet outcomes
are what matter to stakeholders, including public health
commissioners and policy makers [37, 67]. A recent
study comparing the behaviour (i.e. meeting the muscle
strengthening activity guidelines), to the outcome of that
behaviour (i.e., strength), upon all-cause mortality sup-
ports just that. Dankel and colleagues [68] found that
those meeting the guidelines but who were not in the
top quartile for strength did not have a significant reduc-
tion in all-cause mortality risk. Those who were in the
top quartile for strength but did not meet the guidelines
(i.e., persons that could be considered ‘naturally strong’)
had a ~ 46% risk reduction. But, more tellingly, those
who met the guidelines and were in the top quartile for
strength had a ~ 72% risk reduction. Though observa-
tional in nature, this last group could be considered as
those most likely to already be engaged in efficacious
muscle strengthening activities e.g. RT. Evidently it is
imperative that clear instructions regarding the applica-
tion of appropriate effort during RT activities are imple-
mented into public health guidelines. The most recent
Canadian guidelines [56] make a greater attempt at spe-
cifically recommending participation in RT (resistance
machines, free weights, cable pulleys, bands, etc.) with-
out offering suggestions of activities that may lack
efficacy.
Why there is such a lack of emphasis upon RT within
current public health guidelines may stem from a num-
ber of factors. It appears likely that some element of
mischaracterisation of what constitutes RT may be influ-
ential, as would appear evident by the currently recom-
mended examples of muscle strengthening activities. As
a result, there is seemingly lacklustre support for an
approach emphasising RT. Indeed the most recent
report informing the current UK guidelines noted that:
“… any statements on the health benefits of strength
training and flexibility should be positioned as secondary
and less important than the primary message to adults
of undertaking at least 150 min of aerobic activity per
week. “([69], pg, 24).
With policy makers claiming that it has little import-
ance, it is unsurprising that participation in RT receives
little emphasis. Indeed, albeit anecdotal, it is our experi-
ence that, even at sport and exercise medicine conferences
where the value of RT for public health has been
Steele et al. BMC Public Health  (2017) 17:300 
Page 3 of 8
 discussed, many are not even aware that the current
guidelines include recommendations for muscle strength-
ening activity at all. This lack of emphasis may be a factor
responsible for the considerably lower proportion of
people engaged in RT compared with those meeting the
lower effort aerobic physical activity guidelines. Participa-
tion in any form of physical activity or exercise is disap-
pointingly low. Statistics for people meeting the aerobic
portion of the guidelines vary from ~15–20% [70–74],
though Scotland stands out with particularly high propor-
tions of the population (71% of men and 58% of women)
meeting guidelines [75]. Indeed, a recent study shows that
31% of men and 24% of women in Scotland also currently
meet the muscle strengthening guidelines [59], with simi-
lar rates in England of 34 and 24% for men and women
respectively [76]. However, the activities included as
counting towards ‘muscle strengthening activity’ in the
surveillance methods used vary widely. For example, in
the latest Scottish survey, ‘Workout at Gym’ or ‘Exercises’
might be considered as most closely reflecting participa-
tion in RT as described above. But what these categories
constituted was not specified and the former was used to
specify both ‘Weight Training’ and ‘Exercise Bike’ partici-
pation. In contrast, surveys specifying ‘Weightlifting’ in
England report rates as low as 5% for men and 0.9% for
women [70]. Though some data evidently suggests that a
similar proportion of people meet the aerobic and muscle
strengthening activity guidelines, where differences exist
these may be due to different surveillance methods used.
Indeed, where surveys have more clearly differentiated be-
tween these and more specific RT, participation rates are
~5–6% [70, 73]. This is cause for concern, as many may
believe that they are already engaging in behaviours con-
stituting efficacious muscle strengthening activities when,
in fact, they likely are not.
It should be acknowledged that the lack of emphasis
in public health policy is not the only potential culprit
for the lack of engagement with RT [77]. As with any
physical activity and exercise, there are common barriers
to participation and RT might be considered to present
its own unique ones. In addition to the commonly cited
barrier of time to exercise participation, many also re-
port barriers associated with the accessibility to specia-
lised equipment and/or facilities, such as travel time and
costs [78–81]. Barriers to participation are also likely to
be population specific. Indeed, in older community
dwelling adults, a population for whom RT may be of
particular benefit, who cite similar access barriers to
those noted above, many cite ongoing pain and injury as
primary barriers to participation in RT [82].
The suggestion is that many assume participation in
exercise or physical activity requires the use of specia-
lised equipment and/or facilities, in addition to extensive
time commitments. Indeed, as noted, though it can be
performed without equipment (i.e., bodyweight), RT is
commonly performed using some kind of equipment to
provide resistance (i.e., free weights, resistance machines,
elastic resistance bands, etc.) and organizational recom-
mendations regarding RT prescription often emphasise
these approaches [83]. The recommendations provided
by these organizations are also often complex, time-
consuming, and require heavy loads for resistance. Com-
plexity in their recommendations includes the use of
periodisation in addition to the performance of a high
volume of exercises performed in multiple sets resulting
in a substantial time commitment. However, many of
these recommended RT practices have in fact been heav-
ily questioned. Periodisation is lacking in evidence for its
efficacy [84, 85], multi-jont exercises appear to offer simi-
lar benefits as single joint-exercises for most muscle
groups [86], and assuming effort is sufficiently high single-
set protocols offer largely similar benefits to multiple-set
protocols [38, 39]. Indeed a number of studies provide ex-
amples of where a relatively low to moderate dose of RT
has been effective for a range of health outcomes for both
young and old populations (e.g. [87–95]). Further, many
oragnisations also imply in their recommendations of par-
ticular relative loads (i.e., % of 1 repetition maximum
[RM]) that a readily modifiable external resistance is in
fact necessary, which may not be the case [96, 97], with
perhaps the exception of for outcomes such as bone min-
eral density where, though low loads can still produce
benefit, higher loads might optmise these outcomes [98].
As such, many are likely unaware that RT can be per-
formed in a time efficient manner in a variety of settings
with minimal/no equipment. For example, in Mexican pri-
mary care settings it is common to have exercise space
and water bottles of various sizes filled with sand for RT
activities—materials that are locally available at little or no
cost, but can be used in a facility or home environment.
On top of this, despite recent work looking to under-
stand barriers and motivators to participation in RT
[82], a theoretical model to guide interventions to in-
crease initiation and adherence is currently lacking [77].
Thus we are currently in a position whereby we have
considerable evidence supporting the efficacy of RT (i.e.,
that it works when people do it under ideal conditions),
but a considerable lack of evidence examining its effect-
iveness (i.e., whether people will actually do it under
ecologically valid conditions). At present this is a conun-
drum for most of sport and exercise medicine [67],
though, with its lack of emphasis in public health
research, even more so for RT.
Conclusions
We acknowledge that for many the primary issue relat-
ing to physical activity and public health is first and fore-
most how we can get people to do any in the first place.

 In this respect there are contrasting opinions and on-
going debate regarding the application of higher effort
models of physical activity and exercise to public health
[37]. It might therefore seem almost self-indulgent for
researchers to opine on the potential benefits of RT in
this respect. However, though at present there may be
little evidence supporting the effectiveness of ecologic-
ally valid approaches to RT for public health, we are
quite convinced that at present we have considerable
evidence suggesting it may be an efficacious approach.
As such, our motivation for penning the present piece is
twofold.
First we hope to increase interest in RT such that more
care providers might participate in specific conversations
about its engagement and participation. Indeed, it has
recently been argued that doctors should be able to pre-
scribe exercise like a drug [99] and an effort based
model to inform RT prescription would appear to have
considerable merits [52]. Few doctors make recommen-
dations for physical activity participation of any kind and
in instances when they do they invariably emphasise aer-
obic exercise (59% of the time) compared with RT (13%
of the time) [100]. Further, when systematic approaches
to address exercise promotion in clinical settings are de-
veloped, screening and exercise promotion messages
often do not address RT leaving physicians and patients
without basic tools to cue a conversation and goal
setting in the area [101, 102]. The power of such conver-
sations to at least heighten awareness of RT as a comple-
mentary
or
even
alternative
approach,
in
physical
activity and exercise should not be overlooked. The
elderly in particular seem receptive to physician’s recom-
mendations in this regard, with this being almost as
commonly cited as a motivator for RT participation as
knowledge of its health benefits [82].
Appreciably, the above intent is unlikely to translate to
a sudden upsurge in public participation in efficacious
RT approaches. Nonetheless, our second motivation is
that that this piece may serve to stimulate a wider aca-
demic interest in RT from a public health perspective,
and to highlight the need for trials examining not only
the efficacy of this mode, but also the effectiveness.
Rigorous trials examining complex interventions – in-
formed by appropriate theoretical models aimed at
behavioural change to overcome barriers, increase initi-
ation, and maintain adherence to RT interventions – are
essential, in combination with appropriate health out-
comes examined as dependent variables (outcomes), as
such variables are important to stakeholders and policy
makers. In addition to this is a need to identify interven-
tions that are cost effective and sustainable in their
implementation. There has been a call for all exercise
trials, including RT, to be examined in real world
settings such as community centres [103].
Some models already exist for better integrating effica-
cious RT into public health interventions, including the
Lift for Life® RT program in Australia. Recent work has
examined the factors associated with engaging in RT
behaviours in addition to the application of theory-based
approaches for maintaining RT behaviours [82, 104–106],
and evaluations of community based interventions are
emerging [107]. Thus far, findings have been promising, as
they suggest that there are likely simple, low cost, effective
approaches possible to increase RT behaviours. We are
optimistic that this piece and further work may help to
finally push the present higher effort paradigm shift to
more explicitly and prominently include RT in its message
for the benefit of public health.
