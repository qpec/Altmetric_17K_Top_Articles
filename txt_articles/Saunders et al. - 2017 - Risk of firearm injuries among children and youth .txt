irearm injuries are a substantial cause of morbidity and 
mortality among children and youth.1,2 They have a high 
case-fatality rate3 and, among survivors, leave lasting 
repercussions with associated high direct medical and indirect 
costs.4 In Canada, an average of 1300 firearm-related deaths 
occur annually5 and many more firearm injuries lead to hospital 
admissions or emergency department visits.1,6,7 Several risk fac-
tors have been identified for sustaining a firearm injury or being a 
victim of a homicide. They include young age (< 5 yr) and late 
adolescence, male sex, low socioeconomic status, Indigenous 
ethnicity, black race, access to a firearm in the home and involve-
ment in a gang.1,8–12 Canadian emergency physicians and pedia-
tricians have recognized the need to identify at-risk populations 
to enable targeted strategies to prevent violent injuries.6,9 Such 
strategies are essential to counter the rising trend of violent 
crimes involving handguns in major Canadian cities12 and to 
lessen the burden of preventable unintentional firearm injuries.
One potential at-risk group includes the growing population of 
immigrant children and youth in Canada. Immigrants now make 
up 19% of the Canadian population.13 Although studies have 
reported lower rates of unintentional injury among immigrants 
than among Canadian-born children and youth,14,15 there was 
cause-specific variability and no population-based data on 
assaults were included. The immigrant paradox16 — a theory that, 
despite facing social disadvantage, new immigrants have better 
health outcomes than native-born people — has not been consis-
tently observed among children17 nor well studied among victims 
of violent crime or unintentional firearm injuries. It is unknown 
whether immigration itself or immigration-related factors such as 
time since migration, region of origin and refugee status are 
related to firearm injury. Immigrants may bring their home coun-
try’s normative behaviours with them, including perceived need 
for firearm ownership.18 Firearm ownership varies across the 
globe, with rates as high as 112 firearms per 100 people in the

ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND: Firearm injuries contribute 
to substantial morbidity and mortality. The 
immigrant paradox suggests that, despite 
being more socially disadvantaged, immi-
grants are less likely than nonimmigrants 
to have poor outcomes. We tested the asso-
ciation of immigrant characteristics with 
firearm injuries among children and youth.
METHODS: We conducted a population-
based cohort study involving residents of 
Ontario aged 24 years and younger from 
2008–2012 using health and administra-
tive databases. We estimated rate ratios 
of unintentional and assault-related fire-
arm injuries by immigrant status using 
Poisson regression models with General-
ized Estimating Equations.
RESULTS: We included 15 866 954 nonim-
migrant and 4 551 291 immigrant person-
years in our analysis. Nonimmigrant 
males had 1032 unintentional (12.4 per 
100 000, 95% confidence interval [CI] 
11.7–13.2) and 304 assault-related (3.6 
per 100 000, 95% CI 3.2–4.0) firearm inju-
ries. Immigrant males had 148 uninten-
tional (7.2 per 100 000, 95% CI 6.1–8.5) 
and 113 assault-related (5.5 per 100 000, 
95% CI 4.5–6.6) firearm injuries. Com-
pared with nonimmigrants, immigrants 
had a lower rate of unintentional firearm 
injury (adjusted rate ratio 0.5, 95% CI 
0.4–0.6) but a similar rate of assault-
related firearm injury. Among immi-
grants, refugees had a 43% higher risk of 
assault-related firearm injury compared 
with nonrefugees (adjusted rate ratio 
1.4, 95% CI 1.0–2.0). Immigrants from 
Central America and Africa accounted 
for 68% of immigrants with assault-
related firearm injuries.
INTERPRETATION: Compared with non-
immigrants, immigrant children and 
youth had a lower risk of unintentional 
firearm injury, although the risk of 
assault-related firearm injury was 
higher among refugees and immigrants 
from Central America and Africa. The 
results suggest that prevention strate-
gies for firearm safety should target 
nonimmigrant youth as well as these 
newly identified high-risk immigrant 
populations.

United States, in contrast to 0.6 firearms per 100 in Japan2 and 26 
per 100 in Canada.5 Global cultural norms for use of firearms for 
self-protection and involvement with gangs also vary. Moreover, 
circumstances that lead to migration, settlement supports and 
integration may affect the risk of firearm injuries.
As Canada embraces more immigrants, in particular from 
areas with civil unrest and economic hardship19 in the context of 
an increasing spate of firearm injuries,5,20 delineation of firearm 
risk among immigrants is important. We conducted a study to 
describe the epidemiology of victims of unintentional and 
assault-related firearm injuries among immigrant children and 
youth in Ontario and to test the association of immigration char-
acteristics with firearm injuries.
Methods
We conducted a population-based cohort study using health and 
other administrative databases available at the Institute for Clini-
cal Evaluative Sciences (ICES).
Data sources
Ontario has a single-payer universal Ontario Health Insurance Plan 
(OHIP) through which most hospital and physician services are 
insured. Unique OHIP identification numbers were encoded and 
linked to data from several health and administrative databases. 
The Registered Persons Database, Ontario’s health care registry, 
contains sociodemographic information, including age, sex and 
postal code, of all OHIP-eligible residents. The Canadian Institute 
for Health Information’s Discharge Abstract Database and National 
Ambulatory Care Reporting System collect data on hospital admis-
sions and emergency department visits, respectively. The Ontario 
Registrar General — Death Files includes all deaths by cause. The 
Rurality Index of Ontario was used to determine rurality.21 Statistics 
Canada’s Postal Code Conversion File was used to determine 
neighbourhood income quintiles at the dissemination area level 
using Canadian census data (2006). The 2006 census, used also for 
population denominators, was chosen because the 2011 census 
was completed voluntarily and may introduce bias. Data from the 
most recent census (2016) are not yet available.
Immigration information was obtained from Immigration, 
Refugees and Citizenship Canada’s Permanent Resident Data-
base. Permanent residents (immigrants granted permission to 
live and work in Canada without limitations on their stay) are eli-
gible for provincially insured health care services, typically within 
3 months after arrival. The available portion of this database 
includes data for all permanent residents to Canada landing in 
Ontario from 1985 to 2012, including those who eventually 
become citizens, but not including undocumented or temporary 
residents (e.g., foreign students). Probabilistic linkage to the Reg-
istered Persons Database identifies about 86% of permanent res-
ident immigrants, and data quality and linkage details have been 
published elsewhere.22,23 The MOMBABY Database at ICES links 
inpatient admission records from the Discharge Abstract Data-
base for mothers and their newborns delivered in Ontario hospi-
tals.22 This database was used to identify newborns born in Can-
ada to immigrant mothers.
Study population
We included all children and youth aged 24 years and younger 
living in Ontario from Jan. 1, 2008, to Dec. 31, 2012, who had a 
valid OHIP number. Individuals with a missing or invalid OHIP 
number or non-Ontario residents were excluded. Within the 
study period, we created 5 annual cohorts and assigned socio-
demographic data annually with prespecified cut points based 
on data available as of Dec. 31 of the cohort year.
Outcome measures
The primary outcome measures were unintentional and assault-
related firearm injuries. Injuries were defined in terms of emergency 
department visits, hospital admissions, and in- and out-of-hospital 
deaths using International Statistical Classification of Diseases and 
Related Health Problems, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-
10-CM) codes for external causes of injury (Appendix 1, available at 
www.cmaj.ca/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1503/cmaj.160850/-/DC1).24 Fire-
arm injuries identified with the ICD-9-CM codes were validated in a 
study that used state-level administrative data in Washington (sen-
sitivity 92% and positive predictive value 94%).25 Firearm injury in-
tent from computerized discharge records and expert chart abstrac-
tion has shown 83% agreement.25 Intent is determined from 
internationally agreed upon codes used by the World Health Organi-
zation.26 We included multiple injury events for the same patient if 
the injury did not result from the same episode.
Predictor
The main predictor was immigrant status, defined as any child or 
youth with permanent residency status or born to a mother with 
permanent residency status, landing in Canada after Jan. 1, 1985. 
Children born to immigrant mothers before 1985, when immigra-
tion data became available, were categorized as nonimmigrants. 
Children of immigrant mothers were included because risk of 
injury is associated with maternal immigrant status,27 and mater-
nal immigrant status may reflect a child or youth’s exposure to 
firearms and firearm-related behaviours in the home environment.
Covariates
Male sex, older adolescence and low socioeconomic status have 
been associated with firearm injury or homicide risk.1,9,28 There-
fore, we included age, sex and neighbourhood income quintile as 
covariates, as well as rurality of residence. Immigration character-
istics used included visa class (refugee v. nonrefugee immigrant), 
region of origin (based on country of birth using modified Immi-
gration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada world regions (Appen-
dix 2, available at www.cmaj.ca/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1503/
cmaj.160850/-/DC1)13 and time since migration to Canada (recent: 
0–5 yr, intermediate: 6–10 yr, long term: > 10 yr).
Statistical analysis
We calculated the total number of firearm injuries during the 
5 study years and age-sex standardized rates per 100 000 popula-
tion using 2006 census estimates. We followed the strict privacy 
guidelines set out by ICES for use of health administrative data for 
health research without individual consent. Institutional policy 
requires suppression of cell sizes of less than 6 to ensure noniden-

tification. We calculated rate ratios with 95% confidence intervals 
(CIs) of unintentional and assault-related firearm injuries by 
immigrant status using multivariable Poisson regression models 
with Generalized Estimating Equations to account for clustering 
of multiple injury events within victims. Separate regression mod-
els were built for each immigration characteristic. All models were 
adjusted for age, sex, neighbourhood income quintile and rural-
ity. Results are presented as the sum of the 5 annual cohorts, age- 
and sex-standardized rates, and rate ratios. 
We conducted sensitivity analyses in which we excluded chil-
dren born in Ontario to immigrant mothers and children living in 
rural areas.
We performed all statistical modelling using SAS Enterprise 
Guide, version 6.1 (SAS Institute).
Ethics approval
Research ethics board approval was obtained from Sunnybrook 
Health Sciences Centre and The Hospital for Children, Toronto, 
Ontario.
Results
We included almost 16 million nonimmigrant and 4.5 million 
immigrant person-years in our analyses (Table 1). Immigrants 
were younger and had larger proportions living in lower 
income neighbourhoods. Among the immigrants, most (98.8%) 
lived in urban areas, 15.6% were refugees, and 24.2% had 
recently immigrated. Almost half (49.0%) were from South and 
East Asia.
In the 5-year study period, male nonimmigrants had 1032 
unintentional (12.4 per 100 000, 95% CI 11.7–13.2) and 304 
assault-related (3.6 injuries per 100 000, 95% CI 3.2–4.0) firearm 
injuries. In contrast, male immigrants had 148 unintentional (7.2 
per 100 000, 95% CI 6.1–8.5) and 113 assault-related (5.5 per 
100 000, 95% CI 4.5–6.6) firearm injuries. Female nonimmigrants 
had 137 unintentional (1.7 per 100 000, 95% CI 1.4–2.0) and 31 
assault-related (0.4 per 100 000, 95% CI 0.3–0.5) firearm injuries. 
Female immigrants had 12 unintentional and less than 6 assault-
related firearm injuries (Table 2). Most (68%) of the assault-
related injuries and a large proportion (43%) of unintentional 
firearm injuries were in immigrants from Africa and Central 
America (Table 2).
The risk of unintentional firearm injury was lower among 
immigrant children and youth (adjusted rate ratio 0.5, 95% CI 
0.4–0.6), whereas the risk of assault-related firearm injury was 
not associated with immigrant status (Table 3). The results of the 
sensitivity analysis excluding children born in Canada to immi-
grant mothers and children living in rural areas did not change 
the direction of these associations. Predictors of firearm injuries 
included older age (15–24 yr), male sex and low income quintile. 
The strength of these associations was greater with assault-
related than with unintentional firearm injuries, as well as within 
the immigrant group compared with the nonimmigrant group in 
the stratified models. Rural residence was predictive of uninten-
tional firearm injury, and urban residence was positively associ-
ated with risk of assault from a firearm.
Figure 1 shows the adjusted rate ratios for firearm injury by 
immigration characteristics. Compared with nonimmigrants, ref-
ugees had a 43% higher risk of an assault-related firearm injury 
(adjusted rate ratio 1.4, 95% CI 1.0–2.0) but they did not differ in 
risk of unintentional firearm injury. Nonrefugee immigrants had 
a 55% lower risk of unintentional firearm injury compared with 
nonimmigrants. With increasing duration of residence in Canada, 
risk of both unintentional and assault-related firearm injuries 
increased. The risk of unintentional firearm injury was lower

among immigrants than among nonimmigrants regardless of 
duration of residence. The risk of assault-related firearm injury 
was 1.3 times higher among long-term immigrants (in Canada 
longer than 10 yr) compared with nonimmigrants (adjusted rate 
ratio 1.35, 95% CI 1.10–1.66), and it was higher among immi-
grants from Africa and Central America (Africa: adjusted rate 
ratio 2.8, 95% CI 2.0–4.1; Central America: adjusted rate ratio 4.1, 
95% CI 3.0–5.6).
Interpretation
Results from this large, population-based study suggest that 
immigration is protective and mitigates the risk of unintentional 
firearm injuries but increases the risk of a firearm assault in cer-
tain subgroups. Among immigrants, refugees were at particularly 
high risk of firearm injuries regardless of intent, as were immi-
grants with a longer duration of residence in Canada. There was

wide variation in the risk of firearm injury by region of origin, 
with considerably high rates among immigrants from Africa and 
Central America.
Canada has relatively few firearm injuries, although many coun-
tries, predominantly in South and East Asia, have even lower rates 
than observed in the current study.29 Nonetheless, rates of uninten-
tional firearm injury among nonimmigrant Canadian children and 
youth are concerning and warrant further attention. The predictors 
of firearm injury in our study were comparable to those in other 
studies that reported males, low socioeconomic status, and late 
adolescence and young adulthood were associated with firearm 
injury.1,9,28 Low rates of unintentional firearm injury among immi-
grants, despite a relatively large proportion living in low-income 
neighbourhoods, supports the immigrant paradox. Few studies 
have evaluated the association between immigration and risk of 
firearm injuries. A Swedish population-based study reported that 
foreign-born adults did not differ from native-born Swedes in the 
odds of nonfatal unintentional firearm injuries but were at higher 
risk of being a victim of attempted murder with a firearm.30 Simi-
larly, homicides were 40% lower among Italians than among immi-
grant males in Italy, although firearm-specific rates were not 
reported.31 In California, foreign-born people were overrepresented 
in homicides of people 15 to 34 years old.32 Immigration-specific 
factors such as visa class and duration of residence and their rela-
tion to firearm injuries were not explored in these studies.
Possible contributing factors to the increased risk of assault-
related firearm injuries in immigrant subgroups may relate to 
higher rates of poverty, lack of access to resources, and more 
bullying and peer aggression among first-generation immigrant 
adolescents.33 The finding that, overall, immigration was not 
associated with assault-related firearm injuries is consistent with 
the finding of Chavez and colleagues,34 who reported no associa-
tion of neighbourhood-level immigration with changes in homi-
cide rates. In our study, the observed variation in firearm injury 
by region of origin may have been related to higher participation 
in Canadian gangs by Indo-Asian, Caribbean and African immi-
grants than by those from other regions, and it highlights the 
need to ensure a healthy transition to Canada for these particu-
lar at-risk groups.35
Household gun ownership increases the risk of unintentional 
firearm injuries.36 The lower rates of unintentional firearm injuries 
observed among nonrefugee immigrants may relate to low rates 
of firearm ownership by immigrants, residence in urban areas and 
selection policies for immigrants to Canada who are highly edu-
cated.13,37 The increasing risk of firearm injury with longer time 
spent in Canada highlights one area for possible public health 
education and consumer regulation around gun safety and stor-
age. It also brings to light a need to improve longer-term settle-
ment and integration services for immigrants to maintain healthy 
behaviours with increasing duration of residence in Canada.

E457
Although the observed rates of firearm injuries in our study 
were substantially lower than those in many other countries,1,2 
they nonetheless represent injuries that are often catastrophic 
and entirely preventable. A number of interventions have been 
associated with reductions in firearm injury rates, including fire-
arm legislation restricting gun ownership, registration and 
access,38,39 and recommendations around safe firearm storage.40 
For reducing assault-related firearm injuries specifically, neigh-
bourhood-level community engagement strategies,41 conflict res-
olution programs,42 emergency department and hospital inter-
ventions with brief motivational interviewing and cognitive skills 
training,43 and community-based programs to develop social 
skills44 have shown promising results. Although such interven-
tions have contributed to reductions in firearm injuries, there is 
room for continued improvement, especially targeted toward 
reducing the number of unintentional firearm injuries among 
nonimmigrant children and youth and assault-related firearm 
injuries in subgroups of immigrant youth.
Strengths and limitations
Major strengths of this study include the large sampling frame, with 
almost complete provincial coverage of children and youth in 
Ontario, and detailed immigration data which allowed for contextu-
alization of contributing immigration factors. We reported on all fire-
arm injuries, including those involving children and youth present-
ing to the emergency department and admitted to hospital, rather 
than more commonly reported mortality data, which allowed better 
ascertainment of the burden of this public health problem. 
There are some important limitations. The immigration data 
available to us did not include information on undocumented or 
temporary immigrants. Paternal immigration, parental education 
level or employment status, and secondary migration data were 
not available and may be associated with risk of firearm injury. In 
some instances, small numbers made more detailed risk stratifica-
tion impossible.
Conclusion
We counted almost 1800 firearm injuries among children and 
youth in Ontario over a 5-year period, which represents almost 
1 injury per day. Nonimmigrant youth had the highest rates of 
unintentional firearm injury. Immigrant children and youth were at 
lower risk of unintentional firearm injury overall, but the risk of 
assault-related firearm injury was higher among refugees and 
among immigrants from Africa and Central America compared 
with nonimmigrants. Understanding why the immigrant paradox 
was not observed in these subgroups needs further study and 
intervention. Prevention strategies for firearm safety should target 
nonimmigrant youth as well as these newly identified high-risk 
immigrant populations.
