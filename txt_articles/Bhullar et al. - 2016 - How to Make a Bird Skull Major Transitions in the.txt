Synopsis The avian skull is distinctive in its construction and in its function. Much of bird anatomical variety is
expressed in the beak; but the beak itself, largely formed of the premaxillary bone, is set upon a shortened face and a
bulbous, enlarged braincase. Here, we use original anatomical observations and reconstructions to describe the overall
form of the avian skull in a larger context and to provide a general account of the evolutionary transformation from the
early dinosaur skull—the skull of an archosaurian macropredator—to that of modern birds. Facial shortening, the
enlargement of the braincase around an enlarged brain (with consequential reduction of circumorbital elements and
the adductor chamber), and general thinning and looser articulation of bones are trends. Many of these owe to
juvenilization or paedomorphosis, something that is abundantly evident from comparison of a juvenile early theropod
(Coelophysis) to early avialans like Archaeopteryx. Near the avian crown, the premaxilla becomes dramatically enlarged
and integrated into the characteristic mobile kinetic system of birds. We posit that this addition of a large element onto
the skull may be biomechanically feasible only because of the paedomorphic shortening of the face; and kinesis of the
beak only because of the paedomorphic thinning of the bones and loosening of articulations, as played out in reverse
during the maturation of Coelophysis. Finally, the beak itself becomes elaborated as the hands are integrated into the
wing. There are structural, kinematic, and neurological similarities between avian pecking and primate grasping. The
ability to precision-select high-quality food against a complex but depauperate background may have permitted crown
birds to survive the end-Cretaceous cataclysm by feeding on insects, seeds, and other detritus after the collapse of higher
trophic levels in the food web.
There is an argument that the age of dinosaurs never
truly ended; that living birds, in their kaleidoscopic
profusion of color and form, are the dominant land
vertebrates of this age owing to their overwhelming
superiority in speciosity, and that mammals have
never fully emerged from their winged shadows
(Dingus and Rowe 1998). Although the wing is an
architectural marvel, it is no less than the bird head,
and in particular the beak, that expresses the diver-
sity of the clade and has enabled its ecological spread
(Zusi 1993). Arguably, the enormous variety of anat-
omy and function that characterizes extant birds is
specifically a product of the diversification of the
neognath birds (Fig. 1), which have fully ‘‘modern’’
beaks (Prum et al. 2015a). There was, in the
Cretaceous, a diversity of stem-group birds (non-
avian avialans), mostly without beaks, at least beaks
in the extant skeletal configuration—but despite the
ever-growing
number
of
described
species,
the
known range of cranial form is distinctly smaller
than that of modern birds (Mayr and Clarke 2003;

 divergent forms are the short-snouted, buck-toothed
sapeornithids and various long-snouted taxa with ex-
tended faces (Zhou and Zhang 2002, 2003; Gao et al.
2012). Crown-clade birds are known from a few
probable Cretaceous neognaths (Clarke et al. 2005;
Mayr 2009). Recent molecular phylogenetic work has
dated the origin of Aves to between 70 and 75 mil-
lion years ago (Prum et al. 2015b). As indicated by
both molecular dating estimates and fossils, by the
early Paleogene, the second and final phase of avialan
ecological expansion was well underway, laying a
foundation for modern avian diversity (Leonard et
al. 2005; Lindow and Dyke 2007; Waterhouse et al.
2008; Dyke and Lindow 2009; Mitchell 2015).
Birds are, in the end, reptiles, and here we exam-
ine the overall architecture of the avian skull in the
larger context of reptilian evolution using new infor-
mation from juvenile and adult non-avialan dino-
saurs, early avialans, and crown-clade birds. We
show that aspects of the avian skull were present in
the
early
ancestors
of
archosaurs;
but
that
juvenilization or paedomorphosis was an essential
prerequisite for several unique features of the avian
feeding system, especially as relates to avian cranial
mobility or kinesis. Finally, we elaborate on the hy-
pothesis that the avian beak is a surrogate ‘‘hand’’ in
a clade of paradoxically hand-less maniraptors.
Methods
Specimens and references examined to assemble new
images and reconstructions: We chose these taxa as
representatives of an early theropod, an early avialan,
and a crown-clade bird. Coelophysis is a Late Triassic
taxon that is probably the best-known early theropod
from skeletal remains, and includes apparent onto-
genetic
series.
Our
inference
of
‘‘juvenile’’
and
‘‘adult’’ states for Coelophysis follows previous liter-
ature but is not rigorously validated by bone histol-
ogy and additional studies as is the status of the
specimens of Archaeopteryx (Colbert 1989; Houk et
al.
1990;
Erickson
et
al.
2009).

 previous morphometric work indicates that the small
specimens we here label as juvenile do in fact fall
into a juvenile or embryonic morphospace, and
the large specimen we interpret as an adult clusters
with other archosaurian adults. Archaeopteryx is one
of the best known early avialans and has been ex-
tensively analyzed and published on. It is difficult to
justify any single extant bird as representative of the

crown,

tinamous,

The distinctiveness of the bird head
Although the profile of the avian head, from a dis-
tance or through a glass, darkly, is distinctively
reptilian, and in particular archosaurian, with an
elongated snout and a compressed orbital and tem-
poral region (as opposed to the subequal facial, or-
bital, and temporal regions of most squamates, for
instance)
(MARUGA
´ N-LOBO
´ N
and
Buscalioni
2003) (Fig. 2), upon closer examination it becomes
evident that the head is a rather simplified composite
of two major components: the elongate cone of the
beak and the bulbous, rounded braincase overarching
the enormous eyes (Fig. 2e–f). As in mammals, the
endochondral bones of the internal braincase are
pushed outward and downward and have become
confluent with the dermal bones of the skull roof;
the rest of the skull, too, seems to have been dra-
matically affected by the enlargement of the brain
(Bhullar et al. 2012). As discussed at length later,
this relative enlargement at least owes in part to pae-
domorphosis or juvenilization. Crown-clade birds are
even more paedomorphic than early avialans like
Archaeopteryx and so their large brains reflect a
nearly ‘‘embryonic’’ condition. In addition to paedo-
morphosis, though, there is abundant evidence that
bird brains are elaborated in regions related to sen-
sation and motor control(Hopson 1977; Jarvis et al.
2005). It is at present unclear to what extent paedo-
morphosis on the one hand and sensory elaboration
on the other have influenced the form of the avian
brain and skull, but we suspect that both have played
a role. Sensory-related brain enlargement in particu-
lar is manifested in a massively inflated cerebrum,
elaborated visual areas of the midbrain, and a greatly
enlarged cerebellum (Karten 1974). The cerebral en-
largement encompasses most of the forebrain, but it
is particularly concentrated in the regions associated
with vision, especially a dorsal structure called the
hyperpallium
or,
sometimes,
the
‘‘visual
wulst’’
(Wulst being German for bulge or ridge). The
visual
wulst
receives
and
integrates
information
from the contralateral vision-related neurons in the
midbrain (Revzin 1969; Karten et al. 1973; Miceli et
al. 1979; Reiner and Karten 1983; Shimizu and
Bowers 1999; Medina and Reiner 2000; Jarvis et al.
2005). It is often considered a defining feature of the
avian forebrain, although a thorough search for ho-
mologous cell populations and surface structures in
other reptiles, especially non-dinosaurian reptiles, has
not been conducted (Balanoff et al. 2013). Certainly,
it is most prominent in birds. Perhaps less obvious
but no less significant is the great expansion of that
part of the brain most dedicated to vision, the mid-
brain. The optic tectum is so enlarged as to push
downward the equally sizeable optic lobes; and
both the tectum and optic lobes contain the most
elaborately structured and layered cells within the
avian brain (Karten 1974; Reiner and Karten 1983).
Finally, the avian cerebellum is greatly elaborated
and ridged, possibly in association with the coor-
dination required for flight (Pearson 1972); but see
(Balanoff et al. 2015). In development, the eyes
form from outpocketings of the brain, and like
the remainder of the visual system they are enor-
mous. This entire unit—the eyes and the brain—is
responsible for the distinctive shape of the poste-
rior portion of the skull (Figs. 2e–f and 3). Just as
Evolution of avian skull

 the expansion of the brain balloons the cranial el-
ements outward, so too the eyes force the later-
appearing skeletal elements to compensate around
them.
Lateral to the expanded brain, the adductor cham-
ber of birds ancestrally is dramatically reduced as
compared to that of most non-avian dinosaurs
(Fig. 2e–f), despite re-elaboration in certain highly
nested taxa such as parrots (Zusi 1993). This is per-
haps generally understood but little emphasized in
descriptions of the avian head. Developmentally,
the adductor musculature forms considerably after
the brain is established as a distinct and enlarged
structure (Noden 1983; Evans and Noden 2006;
Noden and Francis-West 2006); and so here again
a combination of paedomorphosis and crowding by
the brain may be driving the form of another cranial
structure.
The nasal capsule is small compared to that of
other reptiles (Fig. 2), and the olfactory bulbs of
the brain have generally been considered to be re-
duced and birds to be poor smellers (Pearson 1972;
Karten 1974). However, some recent work on the
topic has indicated that the apparent shrinkage of
the olfactory bulbs is an illusion, and in fact that
their size relative to the cerebrum increased several
times along the avian stem and within the avian
crown (Zelenitsky et al. 2011). In fact, a small
facial region including a small nasal capsule is a ju-
venile characteristic and so the proportions of the
nasal capsule, as of the face itself, may be primarily
related again to olfactory atrophication (Bhullar et al.
2012). More work is needed on olfaction in birds—
particularly on the olfactory epithelium and the
physiology of smelling.
Despite the great cranial diversity of the extant
avian radiation, loss is a persistent theme in the
modernization
of
the
bird
head.
Several
skull
bones, notably the postorbital behind the eye, the
ectopterygoid at the back of the palate, and major
processes and components of the other cranial ele-
ments, vanish along the avian stem. The teeth, as
well, are wholly lost (Figs. 2–3), a process that oc-
curred several times within Avialae and apparently in
a patchwork fashion among the ancestrally dentiger-
ous elements of the skull (Louchart and Viriot 2011).

viduals are shown below and adult individuals above. Many features of the juvenile Coelophysis resemble adult features of the avialans.

 Remarkably, though, a small percentage of one
extant
bird
species—the
humble
domestic
fowl
Gallus gallus—does show the rudiments of tooth-
like structures, sharing at least some of the genetic
architecture of teeth. These are Talpid2 mutants,
which bear projections on the lateral margins of
the jaw and the palate that resemble very early-
stage alligator teeth (Harris et al. 2006; Tokita et
al. 2013; Weeks et al. 2013). However, the ability
to produce dental tissues—dentine and enamel—ap-
pears to be forever lost from the bird genome
(Girondot and Sire 1998; Sire et al. 2008; Davit-
Beal et al. 2009).
Instead of teeth arrayed along a robust maxilla as
in the majority of tetrapods, the functional surfaces
of the avian jaw are formed by the keratinous rham-
photheca covering a beak made of primarily of the
premaxilla (Fig. 3), itself hypertrophied from its an-
cestral condition as the tip of the snout (Hieronymus
and Witmer 2010; Bhullar et al. 2012, 2015; Huang
et al. 2016). This premaxillary expansion accompa-
nies a reduction of the maxilla. Also profoundly
transformed are the structures of the palate, espe-
cially the pterygoids, which are much-reduced and
narrowed and no longer reach anteriorly past the
orbit; and the palatines, which are elongated and
lose
their
lateral
connection
to
the
maxillae
(Fig. 2e–f). All of these alterations serve in part to
permit a sliding of the entire palate in service to the
unique avian kinetic system, by which the upper jaw
(consisting primarily of the premaxillary beak and
the streamlined palate) can be lifted independently
relative to the braincase, driven ultimately by some-
thing approximating a four-bar linkage actuated by a
protractor muscle that pulls on the now-mobile
quadrate (Fig. 4) (Bu
¨hler et al. 1988; Gussekloo
and Zweers 1999; Gussekloo and Bout 2005).
Birds as dinosaurs and the macropreda-
tory roots of the avian skull
Since the middle of the 19th century it has been
accepted that birds are closely related to crocodiles,
and perhaps to dinosaurs (Huxley 1870a, 1870b;
Seeley 1887). Thus, they have long been understood
as having been derived not from small lizard-like
forms, but from predators on other vertebrates,
with larger bodies and stronger skulls and jaws.
Birds, like humans within great apes, like therapsids
within synapsids, like gnathostomes within verte-
brates, owe their genesis to the redder-in-tooth-
and-claw part of the natural milieu. The macropre-
datory reptile clade, of which birds are a part, is
Archosauromorpha,
with
birds
and
crocodiles
occupying the crown as Archosauria. The earliest
and most primitive archosauromorphs known are
already
monitor-lizard-like
predators
(Gottman-
Quesada and Sander 2009). From the substrate of
an archosauromorph, then an archosauriform, then
an archosaurian, then a dinosaurian head, the avian
head originated (Gauthier and Padian 1985; Gauthier
1984; Gauthier 1986,1988). Thus, it is not surprising
that the bird head fundamentally retains a suite of
features originally bent toward macropredation. In
general, and as visible in the primitive theropod di-
nosaur Coelophysis (Fig. 2a–b) this means a long
snout providing for a large gape and an unusually
compressed temporal region (MARUG&Aacute;N-
LOB&Oacute;N and Buscalioni 2003) that is deep-
ened in compensation around an enlarged adductor
chamber for the jaw-closing musculature.
An inexhaustive list of pan-archosaurian features
persistent in birds derived from several sources
(Gauthier 1984; Merck 1997; Nesbitt 2011; Pinheiro
et
al.
2016b):
soon
after
the
emergence
of
Archosauromorpha, an enlarged premaxilla and a
long nasal region, a jugal elongated backward (setting
up the first part of the very elongate jugal of birds),
and a transformed temporal fenestra; around the
level of Archosauriformes, a deepened adductor
chamber in service of greater jaw muscle mass and
a laterosphenoid bone helping to close the ossified
braincase (Fig. 2e–f). Also at Archosauriformes ap-
peared the extensive lateral openings in the skull be-
speaking the presence of a significant paranasal sinus
(Witmer 1995a, 1995b, 1997), further transforma-
tions to the adductor chamber region, and a jugal
now anteriorly elongated as well. A gradual reduction
of some of the cranial roof bones also occurred, in-
cluding the postfrontal and supratemporal within
Archosauriformes.
Finally,
around
the
level
of
crown Archosauria, the extensive shagreen of palatal
teeth characteristic of osteichthyans ancestrally was
dramatically reduced or lost. The pan-avian line in-
cluding dinosaurs like Coelophysis (Fig. 2a–b) is char-
acterized by a dramatic thinning of the cranial bones
and increase of cranial pneumatization, a delicacy of
structure perhaps explaining the crushed preserva-
tion of many small theropods as compared to croc-
odile-line archosaurs of similar size, and increasingly
progressing into extant birds (Fig. 2c–f).
Virtually, every cranial element of birds undergoes
a profound transformation from the ancestral dino-
saurian condition, which is not so different from the
ancestral archosaurian, or even the ancestral archo-
sauriforms, condition, through early avialans like
Archaeopteryx to the crown clade Aves (Fig. 2–3).
These changes are especially concentrated in the

and Clarke 2003; Clarke 2004a; Clarke et al. 2006b;

Along
the
branch
from
Archaeopteryx
through
the
more
crownward
Enantiornithes, cranial morphology appears relatively
stable. Although most enantiornithine material is
crushed and is not as well-described as that of
Archaeopteryx, knowledge of the clade is rapidly
increasing (Padian and Chiappe 1998; Chiappe et
al. 1999, 2001, 2007; O’Connor and Chiappe 2011;
O’Connor et al. 2011, 2013, 2016; Wang et al. 2014,
2015a).
In broad strokes, the major evolutionary stages
from early theropod (Coelophysis) to early avialan
(Archaeopteryx) to crown-clade bird (the tinamou
Nothoprocta) are depicted in Fig. 2a,c and e (adult
individuals). Depictions of the extinct taxa are new
reconstructions based on the original fossil material.
Of the rostral cranial elements, the premaxilla under-
goes a slight relative enlargement at the origin of
Avialae, in concert with the appearance of an en-
larged external nostril. Fusion of the two premaxillae
and drastic enlargement into the beak does not
occur
until
very
near
the
crown,
starting
at
Ornithuromorpha (Clarke et al. 2006a; Bhullar et
al. 2012, 2015) and then concluding in the compar-
atively
‘‘modern’’
beaks
of
Ichthyornis
and
Hesperornis. The nasals remain elongate chevron-
shaped elements restricted largely to the top of
snout until the ornithuran grade where, in at least
Hesperornis and crown Aves, a lateral flange drops
down to occupy a portion of the space relinquished
by the diminishing facial process of the maxilla.
Likewise, the nasal process of the lacrimal, primi-
tively aligned with the skull roof alongside the
nasal bone, drops down to form a nearly vertical
strut occupying the former territory of the maxilla.
The triangular window formed in between the nasal
and orbital processes of the lacrimal now represents
the only remnant of the ancient archosauromorphan
antorbital fenestra. Maxillary reduction begins at
Avialae with a somewhat lighter construction than
even in small deinonychosaurs like Microraptor, but
proceeds in earnest at Ornithuromorpha and on into
crown Aves. The facial process nearly vanishes, the
teeth are shrunken and then lost, and the anterior
end retreats with the encroachment of the premax-
illa. Below the rostrum, the palate is poorly known
for the majority of avialan fossils. This is unfortu-
nate, as the stem avian palate undergoes profound
transformations relative to the ancestral amniote
condition that is, with some modification and fenes-
tration, largely retained by dinosaurs and by early
avialans. The vomer of extant paleognath birds is
extended backward to cup the parasphenoid rostrum
of the braincase, an unusual configuration unique
among reptiles. This is in part the result of the with-
drawal of the pterygoids, primitively the most sub-
stantial bones of the palate but in Aves reduced to
struts that serve as links between the quadrate and
the remainder of the kinetic system. The palatines,
finally, are also greatly transformed, having lost their
extensive lateral connection to the maxilla and in-
stead being primarily directed forward to the pre-
maxilla. Around the enlarged orbit, the jugal and
postorbital are relatively conservative at the base of
Avialae, though the postorbital process of the jugal is
somewhat reduced. By the crown of Aves, the post-
orbital process has essentially vanished and the jugal
is little more than a horizontal rod. The quadratoju-
gal forms a nondescript posterior cap to this rod,
having lost its dorsal process as well; the end fits
into a circular pit on the quadrate and the attach-
ment in life is mobile. The postorbital is entirely
gone. Some of the greatest transformations, however,
are on the skull roof, the cladding for the brain.
Gradually with brain enlargement in theropods, the
calvarium conforms to the neural contours more and
more. As the forebrain enlarges, the frontoparietal
suture is pushed backward, until in Aves the parietal
is relatively small, the frontal huge and domed, and
both elements exceptionally wide. As striking but
more visually subtle is the transformation of the
squamosal from a relatively external temporal arch
element with several slender processes contributing
to the delicate framework of the diapsid upper arch
to a broad, slablike bone—a constituent of the brain-
case sidewall, directly in contact with the dura mater.
This avian feature is analogous to the squamous por-
tion of the temporal bone in mammals. The brain-
case likewise becomes progressively wider through
Avialae and then dramatically wider somewhere
near the crown clade (again this is a region that is
not well preserved in most fossil avialans). The en-
dochondral bones of the braincase sidewall spread
outward to face ventrally. Because early ornithuro-
morphs are not generally preserved in 3D, it is dif-
ficult to say when this occurred. External to the
braincase, the quadrate gains a mobile joint with
the squamosal and an anterior process for the pro-
tractor musculature unique to the avian kinetic ap-
paratus (Fig. 4).
The mandible prominently transforms in losing
teeth, but its other alterations are more subtle. The
postdentary elements are largely conservative, but in
the crown clade of birds there is fusion at the man-
dibular symphysis. This is presaged by the peculiar,

 single predentary bone that appeared and then dis-
appeared along the avian stem (Fig. 3). The cranio-
mandibular
joint
is
likewise
altered,
with
an
elaborated and posteriorly projected lateral condyle
of the quadrate and matching alterations to the ar-
ticular (Clarke 2004a).
Heterochrony opens new vistas for
innovation and radiation
One of the great drivers in the origin of the avian
skull appears to be juvenilization, specifically a type
of heterochrony called progenetic paedomorphosis
that involves a truncation of the ancestral ontogeny
in terms of shape, size, and time (Thulborn 1985;
Weishampel et al. 1994; Long and McNamara 1995;
Bhullar et al. 2012). We have illustrated juveniles (or
subadults in the case of Archaeopteryx) and large
adults of the primitive theropod Coelophysis, the
early avialan Archaeopteryx, and an extant tinamou in
our Fig. 2. Changes in the avialan skulls (Fig. 2c–f)
are relatively slight—increased girth of some of the
bones, extension of the facial region, and in the case
of the tinamou enlargement of the beak. Coelophysis,
on the other hand, undergoes extensive alteration
(Fig.
2a–b).

far
longer, the orbit relatively smaller and constricted
instead of round, the adductor chamber expands
both anteroposteriorly and transversely, and the
braincase becomes relatively smaller. Nearly every
bone of the skull becomes wider—note in particular
the palatal elements, the jugal, and the quadratojugal,
all parts of what would become the avian kinetic
apparatus. The postorbital becomes broader and
more anteroposteriorly elongate as the orbit becomes
relatively smaller. In general, sutures become more
extensive
and
ossified
overlapping
areas
where
bones contact increase in relative extent. The brain-
case is enormously transformed, becoming relatively
narrower. The skull roof bulges upward in the juve-
nile and is relatively flat in the adult with pro-
nounced lateral embayments for adductor muscle
attachment. The posterior part of the skull becomes
dominated by muscle attachments rather than the
housing of the central nervous system.
All of the juvenile features described above are
strikingly avialan in character. The short face, the
large orbit, the thin palate, narrow jugal, tall and
delicate postorbital, constricted adductor chamber
with short squamosal, and large, bulbous braincase
are all features shared by Archaeopteryx and kin, and
progressively developed within Coelurosauria, that
persist and are exaggerated further in birds.
A consistent problem with hypotheses involving
paedomorphosis is the spectre of over-atomization
and of labeling nearly every conceivable evolutionary
change in individual parts of organisms with one of
the heterochronic terms coined by Alberch, Gould,
Oster, and Wake (Gould 1977; Alberch et al. 1979).
If everything is heterochrony, then nothing is hetero-
chrony. Thus, here we use the term in a more re-
stricted way—as referring to ‘‘global’’ heterochrony,
a process that affects the entire organism or nearly
the entire organism, and that is probably related to
the endocrine physiological pathways responsible for
growth, like growth hormones in vertebrates, as op-
posed to the paracrine signaling of early develop-
mental
patterning
(McKinney
1988;
Klingenberg
and Spence 1993). Indeed, David Wake recently
told one of the authors (Bhullar) that it was this
sort of ‘‘strong’’ heterochrony which the pioneering
thinkers of modern evolutionary developmental biol-
ogy had in mind when they wrote their seminal
works. The molecular mechanism behind avian pae-
domorphosis—or rather the multiple events of pae-
domorphosis along the avian stem—has not yet been
identified. It may be entirely out of reach owing to
the long divergence between birds and crocodiles;
but there are some tantalizing hints that genomic
signatures remain (Lowe et al. 2015). It is clear,
though, that significant decreases in size and juveni-
lization of shape occurred and that the progenetic
dinosaurs of the eumaniraptoran line were able to
utilize a variety of niches as adults that were perhaps
unavailable to their larger-bodied kin. Small body
size is a necessity for flight, too, of course—and in
general, there is an idea that heterochrony can enact
radical or saltational change in a relatively short
period of time (McKinney 1988; Raff and Wray
1989; Miiller 1990; Nitecki and Nitecki 1990; Raff
et al. 1990; McKinney and McNamara 1991; Muller
and Wagner 1991; Klingenberg and Spence 1993;
Heard
and
Hauser
1995;
Zelditch
and
Fink
1996Friedman and Carmichael 1998; Love 2003;
Gerber and Hopkins 2011 ). Heterochrony is cer-
tainly more robust to early lethality or inviability
than many other developmental alterations, and pae-
domorphosis at least is also presumably robust to the
lower fitness that often accompanies major shifts,
since that stage of the organism’s ontogeny is ex-
pressed already, transiently, and has been subject to
the slings and arrows of selection. The constraint
that is released, though, is that of having to reach
a
certain
selected-for
adult
form
after
passing
through the formerly juvenile phenotypic stage at
which a paedomorphic organism becomes frozen.

 added
adult
features—that

organisms
become extremely paedomorphic could be a rare
but powerful driver of new innovation and the
breaking of constraint or the unchaining of the
‘‘bauplan’’.

that is in essence a eukaryotic single-celled (or colo-

Out of the mouth of babes:
paedomorphosis enables beak
elongation and cranial kinesis
When one looks upon the panoply of birds upon the
Earth, one looks upon a panoply of beaks. Visually,
alone it would appear that the beak is not only enor-
mously plastic but exceptionally modular. This is
borne out by work that has been done on the mo-
lecular control of beak development, showing its pa-
rameters to be subject to precise control independent
of the remainder of the snout (Schneider and Helms
2003; Abzhanov et al. 2004, 2006; Wu et al. 2004,
2006; Mallarino et al. 2011, 2012; ). Certainly the
beak, as premaxilla, is integrated with the unique
kinetic system of the avian skull (Fig. 4). This
might be no accident; the premaxilla, in being the
derivative of a different embryonic primordium from
the maxilla and in perhaps being inherently modular,
also comes to dominate the snout and to be part of a
kinetic system in teleost fish, the other most-success-
ful vertebrate radiation (Lauder 1979, 1980, 1982). It
is likely that the paedomorphically short maxillary
region
of
avialans
permitted
the
premaxilla
to
become so expanded and dominant while maintain-
ing a functionally viable snout, and that the further
shortened face of the yet more paedomorphic crown
avians enabled further expansion (Fig. 3). Indeed,
those
dinosaurs
and
crocodile
relatives
with
‘‘beaks’’, in addition to turtles and sundry other
taxa with undiminished maxillae, have either slightly
enlarged or not-at-all enlarged premaxillae and are
akinetic (Osmo
´lska et al. 1972; Clark et al. 1994;
Kobayashi
and
Barsbold
2005;
Nesbitt
2007;
Kundra
´t et al. 2008).
Thus, paedomorphosis may have allowed the
origin of the beak. It also almost certainly set the
stage for the avian type of cranial kinesis. Bird
kinesis—most forms of extensive, active (actuated
by specifically adapted muscles) vertebrate cranial ki-
nesis truly—is associate with thin, light, bendable
bones having low levels of contact among them
and large amounts of flexible connective tissue.
Taxa with tightly integrated skulls, a great deal of
overlap among robust bones, and complex sutures
tend to be akinetic and may be mechanically pro-
hibited from kinesis. Indeed, virtually nothing large
and robust among extant tetrapods has an exten-
sively kinetic skull; large non-avian dinosaurs once
thought to have intracranial mobility almost un-
doubtedly did not (Holliday and Witmer 2008).
The birds with the largest skulls, giant phorusrachid
‘‘terror birds’’, and the lizards with the largest skulls,
mosasaurs,
have
robust,
overlapping
bones
and
appear to have been akinetic (Lingham-Soliar 1995;
Degrange et al. 2010, 2012). The general trend, how-
ever, from thin, light, bendable, and loosely attached
to thick, overlapping, and tightly connected is not
simply a repeated evolutionary one: it is also onto-
genetic. Crocodiles, non-avian dinosaurs, and other
vertebrates undergo this transition during growth
(Skinner 1973; Rieppel 1993; Barahona and Green
1997; Carr 1999; Klembara 2004; Vickaryous and
Hall 2007; Bever and Norell 2009; Delfino and
Sa
´nchez-Villagra 2010; Bhullar et al. 2012, 2015; ).
The splintlike jugal of a late crocodylian embryo and
that of an adult bird are remarkably similar. Within
the ontogeny of Coelophysis (Fig. 2a–b) the transition
from thinner, less overlapping elements to heavy,
tightly sutured elements is abundantly clear (note,
however, that the premaxilla of Coelophysis and
some other early theropods is loosely attached to
the remainder of the skull and may have been flex-
ible or passively kinetic). Adult dinosaurs ancestrally
had levels of ossification similar to that of adult
Coelophysis and were most likely akinetic. Kinesis ap-
pears very late along the avian stem, probably in
association with the final and most extreme paedo-
morphic transition just before the crown, during
which, for instance, the jugal and other orbital and
temporal bones are thrown back to virtually embry-
onic states; in this case, then, if it is not precisely
responsible for kinesis, paedomorphosis is certainly a
prerequisite for it.
Crooked of talon, curved of beak:
functional and evolutionary
significance of the avian face
So obvious and prominent are the claws and beaks of
birds that even Homer, in Iliad XVI, recognizes these
two implements by which birds manipulate the
world. The foot, though, serves a dual purpose,
and many of the most primitive extant birds, like
tinamous and chickens, are of a groundfowl-like
habitus, by which the foot is unspecialized for grasp-
ing and is largely a walking or perhaps scratching
tool. The beak alone is left to serve as a sort of

 surrogate hand (Figs. 3–5). It may be no accident
that it is precisely at the Ornithurae node that free
hands are integrated into the increasingly specialized
bird wing and that the beak begins to take its
modern form (Bhullar et al. 2012, 2015). It is also
at this node that the nail or pointed end of the beak
is formed, by addition of bone on the upper jaw and
by a novel element, the predentary, in the lower,
forming a functional ‘‘finger’’ (You et al. 2010;
Zhou and Martin 2011; Zhou et al. 2013a, 2013b;
Wang et al. 2015b;
Huang et al. 2016; O’Connor
et al. 2016).
Numerous explanations have been offered for the
selective advantages of avian kinesis. Among the most
convincing is the idea that simultaneously raising the
upper jaw and lowering the lower jaw permits preci-
sion grasping like that of the human thumb and fore-
finger (Zusi 1984; Bout and Zweers 2001). The beak-
as-hand analogy gains strength from several observa-
tions. The first is the great precision with which birds
can use the beak, and in particular the tip of the beak.
This extends of course to the famous tool usage of
corvids and parrots (Hunt 1996; Auersperg et al.
2011). More fundamentally, though, it is pivotal for
the rapid, high-precision acquisition of small food—
pecking—that appears to be ancestral for Aves (Fig.
5). Pecking includes a targeting phase and then a pre-
hension phase that is then followed by a food trans-
port phase, both of which utilize kinesis (Zweers 1982;
Bermejo and Zeigler 1989; Van Den Heuvel 1991;
Zweers and Gerritsen 1996). It is well studied in cer-
tain model neognaths—pigeons and to a certain
extent chickens—but poorly understood in paleog-
naths. It is performed at high speed and with great
specificity and involves complex positioning (which
also employs the heavily modified avian neck appara-
tus)—another use for the highly developed avian
visual system (LaMon and Zeigler 1984; Bermejo
and Zeigler 1989; Zweers and Gerritsen 1996). We
find it compelling that pecking is described as
Fig. 5 The near-crown toothed bird Ichthyornis demonstrating the stages of the typical avian pecking behavior in which the beak is used
as a surrogate hand. A targeting phase (middle) is followed by a precision grip on the small object (below), which utilizes the kinetic
system, and then by one or more rounds of food transport (above) which also utilizes beak kinesis.

 having similar kinematics and timing to primate grasp-
ing in several works (Klein et al. 1985; Bermejo and
Zeigler 1989). Moreover, the organization of motor re-
gions in the brain is broadly similar between the human
hand and the prehensile beak (Deich et al. 1985).
Thus,
the
beak
is
a
sort
of
avian
hand.
Furthermore, we note that, in concert with the giz-
zard, pecking as enabled by the precision grasp of the
beak permits the rapid collection of small pieces of
high-quality food from a depauperate but visually
and texturally complex substrate. Primitive extant
birds are highly omnivorous, eating grain, seeds,
small animals, and a range of other food items
(Mosa 1993). The ability to pick through detritus
and high-grade small morsels for sustenance would
have been indispensable in the aftermath of the cat-
aclysmic end-Cretaceous extinction that annihilated
the entire avian stem, as explicitly suggested by
recent work examining disparity in theropod teeth
during the end of the Mesozoic (Larson et al.
2016). Detritus feeding in fact seems to be a
common characteristic of terrestrial survivors of
that event (Sheehan and Hansen 1986). The avian
face may then have led birds through the lean
times that ended the rest of their line.
