Abstract
Background: A documented penicillin allergy is associated with increased morbidity
including length of hospital stay and an increased incidence of resistant infections
attributed to use of broader-spectrum antibiotics. The aim of the systematic review
was to identify whether inpatient penicillin allergy testing affected clinical outcomes
during hospitalization.
Methods: We performed an electronic search of Ovid MEDLINE/PubMed, Embase,
Web of Science, Scopus, and the Cochrane Library over the past 20 years. Inpa-
tients having a documented penicillin allergy that underwent penicillin allergy testing
were included.
Results: Twenty-four studies met eligibility criteria. Study sample size was between
24 and 252 patients in exclusively inpatient cohorts. Penicillin skin testing (PST)
with or without oral amoxicillin challenge was the main intervention described (18
studies). The population-weighted mean for a negative PST was 95.1% [CI 93.8-
96.1]. Inpatient penicillin allergy testing led to a change in antibiotic selection that
was greater in the intensive care unit (77.97% [CI 72.0-83.1] vs 54.73% [CI 51.2-
58.2], P<.01). An increased prescription of penicillin (range 9.9%-49%) and cephalos-
porin (range 10.7%-48%) antibiotics was reported. Vancomycin and fluoroquinolone
use was decreased. Inpatient penicillin allergy testing was associated with decreased
healthcare cost in four studies.
Conclusions: Inpatient penicillin allergy testing is safe and effective in ruling out
penicillin allergy. The rate of negative tests is comparable to outpatient and periop-
erative data. Patients with a documented penicillin allergy who require penicillin
should be tested during hospitalization given its benefit for individual patient out-
comes and antibiotic stewardship.

INTRODUCTION
Drug allergy is a term which by convention describes immunologi-
cally mediated drug hypersensitivity reactions.1,2 Drug allergy may
manifest in any form of early or delayed hypersensitivity as outlined
by the Gell and Coombs classification.3 A true drug allergy is unpre-
dictable and associated with significant morbidity and healthcare
utilization.4,5 Nonallergic drug reactions may mimic drug allergy lead-
ing to mislabeling patients with a drug allergy. Such patients receive
less effective and more expensive pharmacotherapy.5
Penicillin
allergy is the most common drug allergy documented in a medical
record.6,7 The prevalence of reported penicillin allergy is estimated
between 9% and 12%.8,9 The prevalence may be as high as 15% in
hospitalized patients.10 A majority of patients with a history of

 penicillin allergy have no subsequent reactions to penicillin or beta-
lactam antibiotics (BLAs).5 It is thought that up to 90% of these
patients have an unnecessary label of “penicillin allergy”.5 This is
partly due to overuse of the term “allergy” when confounding symp-
toms related to the patient’s illness may be attributed to penicillin
“allergy”.1 However, such patients commonly receive second-line
broad-spectrum antibiotics for infections that may be treated with
first-line BLAs.11 Common antibiotics that substitute first-line peni-
cillins include fluoroquinolones, clindamycin, vancomycin, and third-
generation cephalosporins. For this reason, a documented penicillin
allergy increases patient risk for infections caused by Clostridium dif-
ficile, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and van-
comycin-resistant enterococcus (VRE).6 Furthermore, a documented
penicillin allergy may be associated with a prolonged hospital stay
related to longer duration of treatment and adverse effects related
to second-line antibiotic use.6 This may have implications on health-
care utilization and cost.
A significant number of hospitalized patients are treated with
antibiotics.12 Hospitalization offers an opportunity to address and
rule out a penicillin allergy especially as adverse outcomes related to
a penicillin allergy are common during a hospitalization event. Peni-
cillin skin testing (PST) is a validated tool to test for IgE-mediated
penicillin hypersensitivity. Drug challenge is, however, the gold stan-
dard to rule out any form of drug hypersensitivity.2 PST has a very
high negative predictive value when both major and minor determi-
nants are used.2,13 BLAs can thus be safely administered following a
negative PST.14,15 Despite some initial concerns that an inpatient
PST may not be valid due to interfering inpatient factors, PST for
major and minor determinants was negative in 78% of 726 hospital-
ized patients with a history of penicillin allergy.16 This value was
comparable to other prior studies.17,18 However, there has been a
steady decline in the proportion of PSTs since 1995 that has been
independent of study subject’s age and time since reported penicillin
reaction.12 Data over the past 20 years have consistently shown the
proportion of negative PSTs to be between 95% and 99% in outpa-
tient, perioperative, and inpatient settings.19 However, studies of
inpatient populations have had small cohorts when compared to
Sogn et al., 1992, calling for an updated negative PST in a larger
inpatient population.16
The Infectious Diseases Society of America and Society for
Healthcare Epidemiology of America guidelines for implementing an
antibiotic stewardship program determined that penicillin skin testing
to assess penicillin allergy merits a weak recommendation.20 How-
ever, there is substantial morbidity related to unconfirmed penicillin
allergy.21 Multiple studies have consistently shown inpatient PST to
decrease use of broad-spectrum antibiotics and decrease cost.11,22,23
However, inpatient PST (with or without oral amoxicillin challenge) is
not often readily available with only around 60% of institutions hav-
ing PST available.24
Other inpatient interventions to address a penicillin allergy may
include pharmacy-led initiatives or guideline-driven protocols with
administration of penicillin test doses in patients deemed to be low
risk for anaphylaxis.10,25 In such cases, patient risk is stratified based
on history and nature of the prior presumed penicillin allergy. Con-
cerns for such an approach are that patients with a vague history of
penicillin allergy may have a positive PST.26 It is as yet unclear
whether inpatient interventions addressing a penicillin allergy have
any implications on clinical outcomes other than antibiotic utilization
and cost. Any inpatient intervention that would impact patient mor-
bidity (such as length of hospitalization, discharge on intravenous
antibiotics, and readmission rate) may increase rates of inpatient
allergy testing and make a case for improving inpatient infrastructure
for penicillin allergy testing. This systematic review and meta-analysis
was designed to address the following aims:
• To outline major inpatient interventions that address a penicillin
allergy during an index admission when a patient would require a
penicillin antibiotic.
• To ascertain the validity of inpatient penicillin skin testing to
safely rule out a penicillin allergy.
• To identify clinically relevant outcomes following inpatient peni-
cillin allergy testing.

Study criteria required for systematic review
2.1.1
|
Types of studies
We included case-cohort studies, interventional cohort studies, and
randomized controlled trials that included an inpatient intervention
to ascertain penicillin allergy in patient admitted with documented
penicillin (PCN) allergy on their medical record. The intervention had
to be performed during the index admission. Studies of pediatric
populations (age <18 years) and perioperative or obstetric popula-
tions were excluded.
2.1.2
|
Types of interventions
We included and evaluated studies that implemented any interven-
tion to rule out a penicillin allergy whether it was a consult service-
driven process, guideline-driven protocol, or standard (PST) for major
and minor determinants with or without oral penicillin challenge.
2.1.3

Types of outcome measures
We included all outcomes described including the following: adverse
outcomes
related
to
the
inpatient
intervention,
proportion
of
patients testing negative for PCN allergy, change in management
including antimicrobial administration, adverse outcomes related to
change in management following testing, effect on cost, and other
longitudinal healthcare outcomes.

MeSH and Embase terms as well as keywords including hospitaliza-
tion, inpatients, drug hypersensitivity, allergy, penicillins, and beta-
lactams. Limitations to the search strategies included the inclusion of
only English-language publications and a publication date range of
the last 15 years. A total of 2212 citations were retrieved from the
six databases. After removal of duplicates, total number of citations
left equaled 1836. All database searches were run on December 6,
2016. The full search strategies are available in the Appendix S1.
Abstracts, conference proceedings, and cross-checked references of
selected studies were also reviewed by authors to identify additional
studies that had not been identified by database searches.

Data collection and analysis
T.J.B. conducted the search strategy and screened for and identi-
fied duplicate titles and abstracts from the database searches.
Two review authors (K.A.S and A.B.) independently screened the
abstracts
using
prepiloted
screening
forms.
Any
disagreements
were resolved by
consensus or
by
consulting a
third review
author
(M.C.B.).
Both
full-text
manuscripts
and
conference
abstracts at national or international level were considered for
inclusion. The remaining studies were evaluated as full-text publi-
cations using predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Rea-
son for exclusion of each study was documented at this stage.
We recorded the study design, sample size, sampling methods,
type
of
inpatient
population,
inpatient
intervention
addressing
penicillin allergy, and subsequent clinical outcomes described. We
contacted the study authors to obtain additional information if it
was not available from the published reports or reports from the
studies. We conducted a qualitative analysis of the study cohort
and inpatient intervention to address PCN allergy and assessed
the clinical outcomes described.
We assessed the risk of bias in included studies using the New-
castle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale for cohort studies and case-
control studies (Table S2 and S3).27 We performed population-
weighted analysis on all comparable observational cohort studies
reporting the rate of negative PSTs to assess whether it would be a
reproducible test when compared to outpatient data. We calculated
the 95% confidence interval for population-weighted means using
the Wilson score interval.28 We performed population-weighted
analysis on cohort studies reporting a common clinical outcome after
implementation of the same or consistently similar inpatient peni-
cillin allergy test.

RESULTS
Our search strategy identified 1836 unique bibliographic citations of
which 74 were selected for full-text evaluation (Figure 1). We
identified 24 studies, 17 full-text articles, and seven conference
abstracts. Two studies were case-cohort studies, while the other 22
studies were cohort studies.10,11,15,22,23,25,29-46 The included studies
were grouped according to their inpatient population, inpatient inter-
vention, and clinical outcomes described (Figure 2). Table S1 summa-
rizes the study characteristics, sample size, and study design. The
inter-rater agreement between the two review authors (K.A.S. and
A.B.) was 89.2% when selecting studies for clinical outcomes with a
Cohen’s kappa of 0.44 (CI 0.13-0.76).
Six studies had patient cohorts exclusively in the intensive care
unit (ICU),22,29-32,38 and one study had a mixed ICU and general
inpatient population.37 Del Real et al. reported outcomes of PST in a
heterogeneous inpatient and outpatient population (n=596) of which
50.3% were inpatient and 24.3% were admitted to the ICU.15 Sam-
ple size varied between 24 and 146 subjects in exclusively inpatient
cohorts

reported an increase in BLA test doses and decrease in vancomycin
and quinolone use following an inpatient guideline to rule out peni-
cillin allergy.32 The study was omitted from pooled-cohort analysis
as the primary outcome was to assess increase in BLA test doses
rather than individual patient or population-based clinical outcomes.
Specific studies described specific infection groups such as infective
endocarditis45 and MSSA bacteremia.33
The commonest inpatient intervention performed was penicillin
skin prick or intradermal testing with or without subsequent chal-
lenge of oral penicillin (or its derivative). This was the primary inter-
vention in 19 studies (Table S1, Figure 2). The proportion of
negative PSTs ranged between 79% and 100%. Motosue et al.
reported a negative PST in 79% of inpatients with 20% of tests
being indeterminate.40 Given that the study was a retrospective
review, patients with indeterminate tests could not be retested. The
population-weighted mean for a negative PST was 95.1% [CI 93.8-
96.1] (Figure 3). One study implemented an inpatient allergy consult
prior to PST.43 Sigona et al., 2016, reported a pharmacy-driven
patient interview that showed 65.6% of patients were subsequently
switched to BLAs.25
The most commonly reported clinical outcome was a change in
antimicrobial therapy (20 studies). Studies consistently reported
change to a narrower spectrum antibiotic, switching to BLAs, and
subsequently increased prescription of penicillin and cephalosporins.
Studies consistently reported a decrease in vancomycin and fluoro-
quinolone use following PCN allergy testing (Figure 2). A pooled-
cohort analysis showed a change in antibiotic prescription of 77.97%
[CI 72.0-83.1] in the ICU setting with a change to a lesser propor-
tion (54.73% [CI 51.2-58.2]) in other inpatient studies (Figure 4).
Two studies reported an annual healthcare saving,22,37 three
studies found a cost saving per individual patient,11,23,42 while two
studies were unable to report a statistically significant cost bene-
fit31,35 (Table S1, Figure 2).
Very few adverse events related to testing were reported. These
were individual cases of anaphylaxis that were more common with
oral amoxicillin challenge at an incidence of less than 1 per-
cent.11,15,23,30,37

DISCUSSION
PST is a safe and reproducible test to rule out immunoglobulin E
(IgE)-mediated penicillin allergy in the inpatient setting. The nega-
tive predictive value of inpatient allergy testing is comparable to
outpatient and perioperative cohort data.19,47 Furthermore, the
intervention has consistently shown to reduce the use of broad-
spectrum antibiotics, a finding that has been reported from studies
in the perioperative setting.48 Antibiotic prescription changes in
the inpatient setting may have greater implications than in the
perioperative setting. Most inpatients receive antibiotics with ther-
apeutic intent rather than prophylaxis with longer treatment dura-
tion.
Further,
the
surgical
population
is
likely
to
have
less
comorbidity than a medical inpatient population. It was reassuring
to note that adverse events to PST were few with most studies
reporting no adverse reactions. An isolated case of self-limiting
hives was reported following intradermal PST.37 One case of
anaphylaxis was reported following second dose of graded oral
amoxicillin challenge that was treated with epinephrine and anti-
histamines.11 No permanent morbidity or death occurred in any
study with inpatient PST and oral antibiotic challenge. Of note,
however, most studies failed to classify reactions as early or
delayed hypersensitivity reactions.
PST is a bioassay that detects the presence of allergen-specific
IgE on a patient’s mast cells. A transient “wheal-and-flare” is noted
over the skin surface within 15-20 minutes of allergen application,
characteristic of a Gell and Coombs type 1 hypersensitivity.19 Skin
testing is the fastest and most cost-effective validated test to evalu-
ate adult and pediatric patients with a presumed allergy to penicillin
and similar drug classes.19 However, it must be reiterated that a PST
in isolation does not rule out the spectrum of immunologically medi-
ated hypersensitivities that encompass drug allergy. PST was tradi-
tionally reserved for patients with no alternative other than penicillin
for their infection. However, PST has emerged to play a pivotal role

 in antibiotic stewardship to avoid unnecessary use of broad-spec-
trum antibiotics that may be less effective, more toxic, more expen-
sive; require lengthier intravenous administration; and are associated
with prolonged hospital stay.5,6 For the aforementioned reasons, a
history of presumed penicillin allergy is not as benign as previously
thought.
Identifying changes in antibiotic prescription is an easily measur-
able outcome that is suggestive of decreased adverse effects

 associated with use of broad-spectrum antibiotics. However, this
may not be necessarily so given that broad-spectrum antibiotics may
be prescribed during subsequent admissions particularly in patients
who had a negative inpatient PST but did not have their penicillin
allergy removed from their medical record. Three studies reported
22.23%,43 49%,46 and 92%42 of patients having the allergy still listed
on the chart following a negative test. The magnitude of this lamen-
table statistic may be underestimated given that it may have been
overlooked as a significant clinical outcome. The heterogeneity of
results suggests that the persistence of a penicillin allergy on a medi-
cal record may be affected by local hospital practices and ease of
navigation within the allergy section of the electronic medical record.
However, it highlights a gross missed opportunity for subsequent
healthcare encounters and may overestimate the benefit of changes
in antibiotics during the index admission.
A substantial change was noted in prescribing narrower spectrum
antibiotics following PST (Figure 3). A rise in both penicillin and
cephalosporin antibiotics was seen, possibly owing to the concern
for cross-reactivity with cephalosporins in a history of penicillin
allergy.49 Conversely, a decrease in vancomycin and fluoroquinolone
use was reported in all studies assessing this change. This suggests a
possible relative risk reduction in acquiring health care-related infec-
tion such as VRE and C. difficile, albeit such outcomes were not mea-
sured directly possibly owing to small patient cohorts. A greater
change in antibiotic prescribing practices was noted in the ICU set-
ting as compared to the general inpatient population following peni-
cillin testing (Figure 4). This occurred despite comparable negative
PSTs
in
both cohorts. Such
findings may
be related to
ICU
physician-related awareness and need to rule out penicillin allergy
when dealing with complex patients likely having multi-organ dys-
function. Furthermore, the growing problem of antibiotic resistance
in the ICU is associated with greater mortality, morbidity, and health-
care cost.50
While PST is a valid and sensitive test to rule out an immediate
hypersensitivity to penicillin, it is worth noting to a drug challenge
remains the gold standard to rule out a drug hypersensitivity reac-
tion.1 Further, European populations have a lower rate of reactivity
to the major determinant penicilloyl-polylysine in a standard PST.
This is likely due to the higher prevalence of amoxicillin/ampicillin
allergy particularly in Southern Europe with patients being sensitized
to the R-group side chain. Populations in the United States are more
likely to develop hypersensitivity to the beta-lactam core.51 As a
result, adverse events may occur at a higher rate in European popu-
lations if only PST is used. Owing to such geographical differences in
sensitization profiles, a standard evaluation for penicillin allergy
should include a PST followed by graded drug challenge when
appropriate.52,53 This would also follow consensus guidelines on
evaluating drug allergy as one may miss immunologically mediated
hypersensitivities
other
than
IgE-mediated
reactions

PST
alone.1
A longitudinal follow-up with age- and sex-matched controls
would be helpful to delineate specific clinical outcomes following
PST that may be related to use of broad-spectrum antibiotics.
Specifically, length of hospitalization, risk of health care-associated
infection (MRSA, VRE, and C. difficile infection), and readmission rate
should be analyzed as well as other clinically relevant longitudinal

 outcomes. The inpatient population is generally older, having greater
comorbidities to the outpatient and perioperative cohorts. Further, a
greater prevalence of penicillin allergy is described in the inpatient
setting.16,49,54,55 The studies identified in this review possibly under-
estimate the impact of inpatient PST given that most outcomes were
related to the index admission. Sustained use of narrower spectrum
antibiotics has been shown to persist during readmissions.11,35 How-
ever, a number of questions related to patient demographics remain
unanswered. It is not known whether specific patient, disease, or
hospital characteristics could affect which populations got testing.
Further, it is imperative to know the timeline of inpatient allergy
testing during hospitalization as patients may receive multiple doses
of second-line antibiotics if testing is delayed. Unfortunately, design
of a prospective trial to rule out penicillin allergy may be unethical
given that there is sufficient evidence to warrant PST in any patient
that would warrant a first-line BLA for infection. The best level of
outcome data would have to be obtained from retrospective analysis
and longitudinal follow-up of appropriately matched controls.
Longitudinal follow-up would also help quantify (and possibly
magnify) the effect of cost. Antibiotic therapy is more costly in
patients hospitalized with true penicillin allergy. This is partly due to
higher cost per dose of alternative antibiotic and longer duration of
treatment.56 Forrest et al. reported no effect on cost probably owing
to the cost benefit solely being calculated at the index admission.35
However, estimates of annual cost savings are significant and may be
more so considering decreased healthcare utilization related to lower
risk of health care-related infection and decreased hospital stay.22,37
This systematic review and meta-analysis has a number of limita-
tions that are largely related to the quality of studies identified. The
level of evidence for such findings was obtained from one case-con-
trol study39 and observational cohort studies.11,15,32,35,44-46 Unfortu-
nately, we could not identify higher levels of evidence (such as
randomized controlled trials) to validate specific risk reductions asso-
ciated with inpatient PST. Therefore, most studies were retrospec-
tive and observational and used convenience sampling. Furthermore,
there may have been selection bias with patients on antihistamines
and beta-blockers being excluded from PST. Other bias related to
indeterminate PST results may have led to result elimination bias.57
Publication bias may have also precluded reporting of negative clini-
cal outcomes. The results of the pooled-cohort analysis are further
limited by the relatively small sample size and convenience sampling
in most studies. Further, a number of studies identified were confer-
ence abstracts; thus, a rigorous review of the study methodology
could not be undertaken. The study findings should be taken in light
of the aforementioned limitations. Despite the aforementioned flaws
associated with observational studies, the proportion of negative
PST was congruent to outpatient data further justifying its use as a
safe and reproducible test during hospitalization. However, the
review shows that multiple inpatient studies have shown any inpa-
tient intervention addressing a penicillin allergy to be a key compo-
nent of antibiotic stewardship. This suggests that penicillin skin
testing is a valid and reliable tool to evaluate a penicillin allergy
when contemplating use of beta-lactam antibiotics. It thus further
reaffirms that penicillin skin testing should be strongly recommended
as an initial evaluation of penicillin allergy. This recommendation
should be reflected in clinical guidelines addressing drug allergy and
antibiotic stewardship.1,20,21,53
It would be difficult to justify and possibly unethical to conduct
a randomized trial where controls are not tested for penicillin allergy
given the amount of evidence justifying its use.5 Given that a timely
PST is not readily available in some hospitals,24 effective inpatient
interventions should strive to incorporate guideline-driven protocols
that stratify patients most likely to benefit from PST.10,25 However,
it is known that the history of penicillin allergy poorly correlates with
patients having a positive PST.19 Thus, allergists should strive to
implement the infrastructure and empower other healthcare provi-
ders to safely rule out allergy with PST36 and follow through by
updating the patient’s allergy on their medical record.

CONCLUSION
Observation data over the past 20 years have shown inpatient peni-
cillin allergy testing to be a validated, safe, and effective method at
ruling out penicillin allergy. The rate of negative tests is comparable
to outpatient and perioperative data. A history of penicillin allergy
should be seriously questioned and proper evaluation should be
undertaken in hospitalized patients who require penicillin-based
antibiotics.5 Further longitudinal studies should address the effect of
inpatient penicillin allergy testing in relation to clinical outcomes
including length of hospital stay, hospital-acquired infection, readmis-
sion rate, and cost related to subsequent healthcare utilization.
Healthcare providers should be empowered to safely perform PST.
This would help risk-stratify patients likely to benefit from early test-
ing and target risk reduction in adverse outcomes related to a docu-
mented penicillin allergy.
