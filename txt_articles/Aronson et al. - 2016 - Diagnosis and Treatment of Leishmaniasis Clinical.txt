It is important to realize that leishmaniasis guidelines cannot always account for individual variation among patients. They are not
intended to supplant physician judgment with respect to particular patients or special clinical situations. The IDSA and ASTMH
consider adherence to these guidelines to be voluntary, with the ultimate determinations regarding their application to be made by
the physician in the light of each patient’s individual circumstances.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Guidelines for the clinical management of persons with leish-
maniasis were prepared by a Panel of the Infectious Diseases So-
ciety of America (IDSA) and the American Society of Tropical
Medicine and Hygiene (ASTMH). The guidelines are intended
for internists, pediatricians, family practitioners, and dermatol-
ogists, as well as infectious disease specialists, practicing in the
United States and Canada (for simplicity, referred to here as
North America). The Panel followed a guideline development
process that has been adopted by IDSA, which includes a sys-
tematic method of grading both the quality of evidence (very
low, low, moderate, or high) and the strength of the recommen-
dation (weak or strong) [1] (Figure 1).
In these guidelines, we describe our approaches to the diagnosis
and management of cases of cutaneous, mucosal, and visceral leish-
maniasis, the 3 main clinical syndromes caused by infection with
Leishmania parasites. Less common or rare syndromes that may re-
quire specialized expertise are beyond the scope of these guidelines.
Wheneverpossible,ourrecommendationsarebasedonrandomized
clinical trials. However, because of the diversity encompassed by
leishmaniasis, which includes a spectrum of diseases caused by
>20 Leishmania species found in many areas of the world, many of
the recommendations are based on observational studies, anecdotal
data, or expert opinion. Although there may be disagreement with
some of our recommendations and suggestions, the approaches we
describe have been both useful and feasible in North America.
Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) is the most common leish-
manial syndrome worldwide and the one most likely to be en-
countered in patients in North America (Figure 2). The skin
lesions of CL are usually painless and chronic, often occurring
at sites of infected sand fly bites. Slow spontaneous healing as
cell-mediated immunity develops is the usual natural history,
accelerated by antileishmanial therapy. A minority of cutaneous
infections caused by Leishmania (Viannia [V.]) braziliensis and
related species in the Viannia subgenus, including L. (V.) pan-
amensis and L. (V.) guyanensis, are associated with concomitant
or late mucosal leishmaniasis (ML), which can cause destructive
lesions of the naso-oropharyngeal/laryngeal mucosa. No uni-
versally applicable treatment has been identified for CL; the
choice of agent, dose, and duration of therapy should be indi-
vidualized. Parasite and host factors, as well as clinical charac-
teristics, must be considered (Table 1).
Visceral leishmaniasis (VL), which reflects dissemination
of Leishmania parasites throughout the reticuloendothelial
system, is potentially life threatening without treatment
(Figure 3). VL is an opportunistic infection in persons with
human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/AIDS or other causes
of cell-mediated immunosuppression.
The primary goals of therapy for VL and CL/ML are to pre-
vent mortality and morbidity, respectively. The only US Food

 and Drug Administration (FDA)–approved medications for the
treatment of leishmaniasis are intravenous liposomal ampho-
tericin B (L-AmB) for VL and oral miltefosine for CL, ML,
and VL caused by particular species. For prevention of leish-
maniasis in travelers, no vaccines or chemoprophylaxis current-
ly are available; personal protective measures to minimize
exposure to sand fly bites are recommended.
Our recommendations for the diagnosis and clinical manage-
ment of leishmaniasis are listed below. Background information
about leishmaniasis, a description of our methods, and the evidence
summaries that support our recommendations can be found online
in the full text, tables, figures, and appendix of the guidelines.
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE DIAGNOSIS OF
LEISHMANIASIS (CUTANEOUS, MUCOSAL, AND
VISCERAL)
I. In a Person With a Compatible Skin Lesion(s) and Exposure History,
What Specimen(s) Should Be Collected for Diagnostic Testing for
Cutaneous Leishmaniasis?
Recommendations.
1. Tissue specimens should be collected from a lesion(s) when
a clinical suspicion for CL exists. Full-thickness skin biopsy
specimens allow for simultaneous testing for other diagnoses,
such as by histopathology and cultures (strong, moderate).
2. Obtain a sample from a cleansed lesion, from which cellular
debris and eschar/exudates have been removed (strong, very
low).
II. In a Person With Manifestations Suggestive of New World Mucosal
Leishmaniasis, What Types of Specimens Should Be Obtained for
Diagnostic Testing?
Recommendations.
3. The initial and most prominent mucosal manifestations typ-
ically are nasal (eg, chronic unexplained congestion/secre-
tions). Oral/palatal, pharyngeal, and laryngeal involvement
may develop as ML progresses or, in some persons, may be
the first or the only noted abnormalities. The clinical signs,
which may evolve over time, may include erythema, edema,
hyperemia, infiltration, nodules, erosion, ulceration, and tissue
destruction (eg, perforation of the nasal septum) (fact, no
grade).
4. Mucosal areas that have macroscopic abnormalities are rec-
ommended for specimen collection; biopsy specimens, ob-
tained by an otolaryngologist, are useful for confirming the

 diagnosis by molecular and traditional methods and for ex-
cluding other etiologies (strong, low).
III. During the Initial and Subsequent Evaluations of Persons With
Cutaneous Leishmaniasis Acquired in Central or South America Who
May Have or Be at Risk for Mucosal Leishmaniasis, What Should Be
Done to Assess the Possibility of Mucosal Disease?
Recommendations.
5. All persons at risk for ML—on the basis of the etiologic
agent of the Leishmania infection, if known, and the region
in the New World in which infection was acquired—should
be questioned about and examined for mucosal symptoms
and signs, respectively, even during the initial evaluation
(strong, low).
6. During all evaluations (ie, initial and subsequent), persons
at risk for ML should be questioned explicitly about the de-
velopment, evolution, and other characteristics of mucosal
symptoms; and they should have a thorough examination
of the naso-oropharyngeal mucosa even if they do not have
any mucosal symptoms (strong, low).
7. Persons at risk for ML should be educated and provided per-
sonalized documentation about the importance of seeking
medical attention for possible ML if they ever develop persis-
tent, atypical (unusual for the person) naso-oropharyngeal/
laryngeal manifestations that do not have a clear etiology
(strong, low).
8. Persons at risk for ML who have persistent mucosal
symptom(s) or compatible abnormalities of the naso-
oropharyngeal mucosa should be referred to a specialist for
Figure 2.
Maps of the geographic distribution of cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL). Adapted and modified from [31]. In Guatemala, the reported cases of CL have been acquired
in the northern departments (in particular, El Petén and Alta Verapaz but also Izabal, El Quiché, Baja Verapaz, and Jalapa). The etiologic agents of CL in Israel primarily include
Leishmania (L.) major and L. tropica but also L. infantum-chagasi. The species L. martiniquensis, which was formally named in 2014, has been identified as the etiologic agent
of cutaneous and visceral leishmaniasis in the French West Indies (Martinique Island) and Thailand, where it previously was referred to as L. siamenensis (not considered a
taxonomically valid name). In Sri Lanka, L. donovani has been identified as the etiologic agent of cutaneous and visceral leishmaniasis. Not all Leishmania species that cause
CL are included in this map (eg, L. amazonensis in South America).

 an otorhinolaryngologic examination, which typically should
include fiber-optic endoscopy (strong, low).
9. Clinicians might refer some at-risk persons without docu-
mented mucosal symptoms or signs to an otolaryngologist,
especially if it was not possible to conduct a thorough review
of systems and mucosal examination or if the assessments
may not have been adequate or reliable (weak, very low).
IV. In a Person With a Compatible Clinical Course and Epidemiologic
Context, What Types of Samples Should Be Collected to Evaluate for the
Diagnosis of Visceral Leishmaniasis?
Recommendations.
10. We recommend the collection of tissue aspirates or biopsy
specimens for smears, histopathology, parasite culture, and
molecular testing (strong, low).
11. Bone marrow aspiration is the preferred first source of a
diagnostic sample. Liver, enlarged lymph nodes, and whole
blood (buffy coat) are other potential sources of tissue spec-
imens (strong, low).
12. Serum should be collected for detection of antileishmanial
antibodies (see VIII) (strong, moderate).
13. In immunocompromised persons, blood should be collect-
ed for buffy coat examination, in vitro culture, and molecular
analyses (strong, very low).
V. What Laboratory Tests Should Be Used to Diagnose Leishmaniasis?
Recommendations.
14. We recommend using multiple diagnostic approaches to
maximize the likelihood of a positive Leishmania result,
using methods such as visualization of the characteristic
amastigote in smears or tissue (histopathology); parasite iso-
lation by in vitro culture; molecular detection of parasite
DNA; and, for VL, serologic testing (see VI–VIII and
Table 2). Simultaneous testing for other diagnoses (eg, by
histopathology and culture) should be considered (strong,
low).
15. We recommend attempting parasite isolation with the as-
sistance of reference laboratories. We recommend that clini-
cians contact their leishmaniasis reference laboratory before
collecting specimens (Table 2). If Leishmania parasites are
isolated in culture, reference laboratories can identify the
species by DNA-based assays or isoenzyme analysis (strong,
low).
16. Molecular amplification assays typically should be per-
formed because they are the most sensitive Leishmania
tests currently available (see VII) (strong, moderate).
17. Leishmania skin testing is not recommended or available in
the United States or Canada; there are no standardized, ap-
proved, or commercially available skin-test products in
North America (strong, very low).
VI. In a Person With Leishmaniasis, Why Could It Be Helpful to Identify
the Infecting Leishmania Species?
Recommendation
18. We suggest that identification of the infecting parasite to
the species level be attempted in cases of suspected CL. Spe-
cies identification may help inform clinical management de-
cisions for individual persons (eg, whether and how to treat)
(weak, moderate).
VII. What Is the Role of DNA-Based Assays in the Diagnosis of
Leishmaniasis?
Recommendation
19. DNA-based assays should be performed, especially if other
diagnostic testing is unrevealing. They are emerging as the
Table 1.

a The highest risk areas for mucosal leishmaniasis (ML) are south of the Amazon basin in
parts of Bolivia, Peru, and Brazil (defined here as the “mucosal belt”). Moderate-risk areas
are south of Nicaragua to the Amazon basin. Low-risk areas for ML are in New World CL
(Viannia)–endemic regions north of Costa Rica. Amazonian basin regions up to an altitude
of approximately 2000 meters are referred to as increased ML-risk regions.
b Leishmania species with an increased risk of causing ML include L. (V.) braziliensis mainly,
but also L. (V.) guyanensis and L. (V.) panamensis. There are other species that can be
associated with ML less frequently. In this document, we refer to these 3 species as
“increased ML-risk species.” Geographic regions in which there is an increased risk for
ML are defined above.
c High therapeutic failure rates after treatment with pentavalent antimonial drugs have been
observed in CL acquired in Amazonian Bolivia (eg, Madidi National Park) and southeastern
Peru (eg, Manu National Park and Puerto Maldonado). Poor efficacy after using
miltefosine in the treatment of L. (V.) braziliensis was reported in Guatemala.
d It is somewhat controversial whether the presence of small subcutaneous nodules is
always associated with complex CL, but certainly complex CL applies if bubonic-like
adenopathy is present in regional drainage area of lesions. These findings have been
linked to complications or treatment failure when only local treatment is administered.
Some experts would not consider systemic therapy needed for a few, small
subcutaneous nodules in Old World CL.

 most sensitive assays for the diagnosis of leishmaniasis
(strong, moderate).
VIII. What Is the Role of Serologic Testing in the Diagnosis of
Leishmaniasis?
Recommendations.
20. Serologic testing is recommended for persons with suspect-
ed VL in whom definitive diagnostic tests for the parasite
(microscopic identification, culture, and molecular tests for
parasite DNA) cannot be conducted or have negative results.
The sensitivity and specificity of serologic tests depend on the
assay and antigens used, as well as host factors. Serologic tests
cannot be used to assess the response to treatment. Antileish-
manial antibodies can be detected years after clinically suc-
cessful therapy in some persons (strong, moderate).
21. We suggest that tests for antileishmanial antibodies not be
performed as the sole diagnostic assay. Antibodies may be
undetectable or present at low levels in persons with VL
who are immunocompromised because of concurrent HIV/
AIDS or other reasons. The potential for false-negative test
results limits the utility of serologic assays in this setting
(weak, low).
22. Serologic testing is not recommended as part of the diag-
nostic evaluation for CL. The currently available serologic as-
says are neither sensitive nor specific for the diagnosis of CL
(strong, moderate).
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE TREATMENT OF
CUTANEOUS LEISHMANIASIS
IX. In a Person With a Consistent Travel History and Compatible Skin
Lesion(s), Is It Necessary to Obtain Parasitologic Confirmation of the
Diagnosis of Leishmaniasis Before Starting Treatment?
Recommendation
23. After a careful diagnostic evaluation in which neither leish-
maniasis nor another diagnosis is confirmed, empiric

 treatment may be indicated on the basis of an individualized
risk-benefit assessment (weak, very low). Comment: This
should be discussed with the patient and reevaluated period-
ically, taking into account the clinical evolution.
X. Is Treatment of Clinically Manifest Cutaneous Infection Always
Indicated?
Recommendations.
24. We recommend that immunocompetent persons with skin
lesions that are caused by infection with Leishmania species
that are not associated with increased risk for ML, that are
defined as clinically simple lesions (Table 1), and that are
healing spontaneously may be observed without treatment
if the patient concurs with this management (strong,
moderate).
25. For persons with CL when the Leishmania species is not
known but the infection was not acquired in an increased
ML-risk region (Table 1, Figure 2), treatment of clinically
simple or healing skin lesions is not required in an immuno-
competent patient who concurs with this management
(strong, low; E. C. dissents, recommending that all persons
with New World cutaneous leishmaniasis [NWCL] receive
treatment). Comment: See XXIV and XXV regarding the
management of CL in immunocompromised persons.
26. We suggest that systemic treatment be offered for persons
even with healing/recently healed CL lesions caused by in-
creased ML-risk species or when the species is unknown
but the infection was acquired in an increased ML-risk re-
gion. Risks and benefits of such treatment should be dis-
cussed with the patient (weak, low). Comment: In some
cases, watchful waiting, with vigilance for signs and symp-
toms of ML, may be a reasonable approach.
27. We recommend that any decision to observe a patient with
CL without treatment should be reevaluated periodically, and
the decision not to treat should be reconsidered if healing
does not progress as anticipated (strong, very low).
28. In all cases of CL, wound care, individualized documenta-
tion of lesion evolution, and patient education regarding the
manifestations and detection of local therapeutic failure/
relapse and ML should be routine components of manage-
ment (see III and XV) (strong, low).

 XI. In a Person With Cutaneous Leishmaniasis, What Could Be the
Consequences of No Treatment or Suboptimal Therapy, and How Should
Persons Who Received No or Suboptimal Therapy Be Monitored?
Recommendations.
29. Potential consequences of inadequate treatment include
poor cosmetic outcome due to scarring or superinfection,
the persistence of a chronic wound(s), and, with some Leish-
mania species, destructive and disfiguring ML. In immuno-
compromised persons, cutaneous, mucosal, and visceral
dissemination may occur (fact, no grade).
30. Persons with CL should be actively monitored by clinical
appearance, including by performing a careful nasal and oro-
pharyngeal examination periodically up to 1 year, or at least 2
years if at increased risk for ML. They should be educated
about the signs and symptoms of relapse and ML and in-
structed to seek medical attention anytime these appear
(strong, low).
31. Symptoms such as chronic nasal stuffiness, epistaxis, or
hoarseness or findings such as septal perforation that occur
anytime in a person with a prior or current diagnosis of CL
or a scar consistent with prior CL should prompt evaluation
for ML, including fiber-optic examination of the affected area
if relevant (see II and III) (strong, moderate).
XII. In a Person With Cutaneous Leishmaniasis, What Factors Should
Prompt Consideration of Use of a Systemic (Oral or Parenteral) Agent for
Initial Therapy?
Recommendations.
32. Systemic treatment is recommended for persons with com-
plex CL as defined in Table 1 (strong, moderate).
33. Initial systemic therapy (see XIII) may be used in persons
with CL in whom it is not practical to use local therapy or
(possibly) if more rapid healing of large, cosmetically or
functionally concerning lesions is preferred (weak, very low).
34. Less common cutaneous syndromes, such as leishmaniasis
recidivans (caused by L. tropica and occasionally other spe-
cies), diffuse cutaneous leishmaniasis (caused by L. mexica-
na, L. amazonensis, and L. aethiopica), and disseminated
cutaneous leishmaniasis (caused by L. [V.] braziliensis), usu-
ally require systemic therapy (strong, low).
XIII. What Systemic Treatment Options Are Available in North America
for Cutaneous Leishmaniasis, and What Factors Should Be Considered
When Selecting a Medication for an Individual Patient?
Recommendations.
35. The parenteral options for systemic therapy currently avail-
able in North America include conventional amphotericin B
deoxycholate, lipid formulations of amphotericin B, pentava-
lent antimonial (SbV) compounds, and pentamidine (listed
in alphabetical order). Oral options include miltefosine and
the “azole” antifungal compounds, including ketoconazole
(if potential benefits outweigh risks for hepatotoxicity and
QT prolongation) and fluconazole (fact, no grade).
36. To maximize effectiveness and to minimize toxicity, the
choice of agent, dose, and duration of therapy should be in-
dividualized (strong, moderate). Comments: No ideal or uni-
versally applicable therapy for CL has been identified. Some
therapies/regimens appear highly effective only against cer-
tain Leishmania species/strains in certain areas of the
world. Both the parasite species and host factors (eg, comor-
bid conditions and immunologic status) should be
considered.
37. Factors that should be considered when selecting CL treat-
ment for an individual patient include the risk for ML; the
Leishmania strain/species and published response rates for
antileishmanial agents in the pertinent geographic region;
the potential for adverse events; age extremes; childbearing
competence and pregnancy; obesity; hepatic, pancreatic,
renal, and cardiac comorbid conditions; preference for and
convenience of various routes of administration; the rapidity
with which one wishes to control the infection; the impact of
lesions on daily activities and patient self-confidence; the pa-
tient/provider comfort level with logistics (eg, Investigational
New Drug protocols); and other practical issues (eg, drug
availability, various types of cost, insurance reimbursement)
(see XII and XXVI; Tables 3 and 4) (strong, low).
XIV. In Which Clinical Settings Can Local Therapy Be Used Effectively
in a Person With Cutaneous Leishmaniasis?
Recommendations.
38. Local therapy is preferred for treatment of Old World
cutaneous leishmaniasis (OWCL) lesions defined as clini-
cally simple (Table 1) and may be useful for localized
NWCL caused by Leishmania species not associated with
increased risk for ML (strong, moderate). Comment:
Local therapy includes heat and cryotherapy, topical oint-
ments/creams with paromomycin and other ingredients,
intralesional injections of pentavalent antimonial drugs
(with or without cryotherapy), and photodynamic or
laser treatment.
39. Eschar(s) overlying ulcers should be debrided before ad-
ministration of local therapy and any secondary infection
managed to maximize treatment effect (strong, very low).
XV. What Are the Recommended Timeframes and Findings to Assess
Response to Treatment in a Person With Cutaneous Leishmaniasis?
Recommendations.
40. Response to treatment is assessed by clinical criteria; repeat
parasitologic testing is not recommended if the skin lesion
appears to be healing (strong, low). Comment: The healing
process may continue after the treatment course is complet-
ed, especially for large ulcerative lesions.

a For simplicity, the terminology “North America” is used to refer to the United States and Canada.
b All treatment-related decisions should be individualized. The lists of treatment approaches/drugs and regimens are not all inclusive. For the listed systemic drugs, see Table 4 regarding adverse events, monitoring for toxicity, and mitigation approaches. See
XXIII–XXV regarding treatment considerations applicable to HIV-coinfected persons and to persons who are immunocompromised for other reasons. See XXVI for considerations for other special populations of patients (eg, young children).
c See Table 1 and X–XIII for additional perspective.
d The pentavalent antimonial drugs—sodium stibogluconate (Pentostam) and meglumine antimoniate (Glucantime)—are considered comparable when dosed on the basis of SbV content. In general, the daily dose does not have an upper limit in milligrams (ie,
the daily dose no longer is limited to 850 mg); however, see XXVI for additional perspective and cautionary notes.

f Persons newly diagnosed with VL should be assessed for concurrent HIV/AIDS or other causes of cell-mediated immunosuppression.
g Liposomal amphotericin is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of VL. The off-label use of amphotericin B deoxycholate is likely to be effective but is generally more toxic (see Table 4).
h An immunocompetent person is defined as someone without an identified congenital or acquired immune defect (eg, HIV/AIDS). In general, Leishmania donovani (India) may be treated with a shorter course of ABLC, whereas L. infantum in Europe requires 10
days’ duration [300, 377].
i See XXIII regarding secondary prophylaxis in patients with HIV/AIDS-associated VL. Chronic maintenance therapy (secondary prophylaxis) should be given until the CD4 T-lymphocyte count consistently remains >200–350/mm3 (see XXIII).
j See XIX and XX for additional perspective about treatment alternatives. Parenteral paromomycin appeared promising in clinical trials in India, but it is not available in North America.
k Miltefosine has been effective in treating VL in India and adjacent areas of South Asia where resistance to pentavalent antimonials is prevalent. There is some evidence to support the use of miltefosine for VL acquired in East Africa. There is less available
evidence to support its use in southern Europe and Latin America.
l Resistance to pentavalent antimonials is well documented in India and has been reported from other areas. In general, pentavalent antimonial therapy should not be used for persons who acquired VL in India.

 41. Persons with CL should have their skin lesions monitored
for 6–12 months after treatment for clinical evidence of ther-
apeutic failure, which is initially seen at the border of a healed
lesion (strong, low). Comment: The first sign of healing is
usually flattening of the skin lesion. By 4–6 weeks after treat-
ment, the lesion size should have decreased by >50%, ulcer-
ative lesions should be reepithelializing, and no new lesions
should be appearing. Ulcerative lesions are generally fully re-
epithelialized and clinically healed by approximately 3
months after treatment.
XVI. What Are the Recommended Approaches for Additional
Management in a Person With CL That Does Not Respond to Therapy?
Recommendations.
42. Additional therapy is recommended (but not necessarily
always with a different agent or approach) when there is de-
velopment of new skin lesions or worsening of existing le-
sions. Additional therapy is also recommended if there is
incomplete healing by 3 months after completion of the
treatment course (strong, low).
43. We recommend that therapeutic failure be assessed by
physical appearance. Relatively little improvement or wors-
ening while on therapy suggests an inadequate response,
and an alternate treatment approach should be planned
(strong, low). Comment: A paradoxical increase in the local
inflammatory response may be seen in the first 2–3 weeks
of treatment and can be difficult to differentiate from thera-
peutic failure.
44. Consultation with a leishmaniasis expert about other
treatment options is recommended for management of per-
sons’ lesions associated with therapeutic failure (strong, very
low).
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE TREATMENT OF
MUCOSAL LEISHMANIASIS
XVII. What Are the Treatment Options for American (New World)
Mucosal Leishmaniasis?
Recommendations.
45. All persons with clinically manifest, metastatic, American
ML should receive systemic antileishmanial therapy, with the
goals of preventing morbidity (eg, disfigurement) and mor-
tality (eg, from aspiration pneumonia or respiratory obstruc-
tion) (strong, low).
46. Before treatment is initiated, a complete examination of the
naso-oropharyngeal/laryngeal mucosa should be conducted
by a specialist to assess the anatomic extension and clinical
severity of the mucosal disease, which have prognostic impli-
cations (strong, moderate).
47. We recommend inpatient monitoring and prophylactic
corticosteroid therapy for persons with laryngeal/pharyngeal
disease and increased risk for respiratory obstruction, as
indicated by symptoms and otolaryngologic/radiologic ex-
aminations, because of the potential for inflammatory reac-
tions after initiation of antileishmanial therapy (strong, low).
48. The choice of antileishmanial agent, dose, and duration of
therapy for persons with ML should be individualized
(Table 3) (strong, moderate). Comments: The traditional op-
tions for ML include treatment with a pentavalent antimoni-
al (SbV) compound (20 mg SbV/kg daily, intravenous [IV] or
intramuscular [IM], for 28–30 days) or with amphotericin B
deoxycholate (0.5–1.0 mg/kg per dose, IV, daily or every other
day, for a cumulative total of approximately 20–45
mg/kg). More recently, on the basis of comparatively limited
data, the armamentarium has expanded to include lipid for-
mulations of amphotericin B (typically, L-AmB, with a cumu-
lative total dose ranging widely from approximately 20 to 60
mg/kg), as well as the oral agent miltefosine (approximately
2.5 mg/kg per day [maximum, 150 mg/day] for 28 days).
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE TREATMENT OF
VISCERAL LEISHMANIASIS
XVIII. In What Circumstances Should a Person With Visceral
Leishmania Infection Be Treated?
Recommendations.
49. We recommend that persons with clinical abnormalities
compatible with VL and laboratory evidence of VL be treated
(Table 3) (strong, moderate).
50. We suggest that clinicians closely monitor persons with
asymptomatic visceral infection and generally initiate therapy
only if clinical manifestations of VL develop (weak, very low).
XIX. What Is the Optimal Treatment for Visceral Leishmaniasis in a
Symptomatic Immunocompetent Person (Person Without an Identified
Immune Defect) in North America?
Recommendations.
51. For an immunocompetent person with VL, treatment with
L-AmB is recommended. The FDA-approved dosage regi-
men is 3 mg/kg/day IV on days 1–5, 14, and 21 (total dose,
21 mg/kg) (Table 3) (strong, high). Comments: Multiple reg-
imens in which the total L-AmB dose is 18–21 mg/kg have
been used effectively in regions other than East Africa.
Doses of 40 mg/kg or more may be necessary in persons with
VL acquired in East Africa. Other lipid-associated formulations
of amphotericin B, such as amphotericin B lipid complex and
amphotericin B colloidal dispersion, are not generally recom-
mended: they have not been approved by FDA for treatment
of VL; and they have been less well studied in VL treatment tri-
als (ie, bioequivalence has not been established).
52. For an immunocompetent person with VL caused by L. do-
novani, acquired in the Indian subcontinent (South Asia),
who is ≥12 years of age, weighs ≥30 kg, and is not pregnant
or breastfeeding, treatment with the oral agent miltefosine,

Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/cid/article-abstract/63/12/e202/2645609 by guest on 03 June 2019
 2.5 mg/kg per day (maximum, 150 mg, in 3 divided doses)
for 28 days, is a possible alternative to L-AmB, particularly
in persons weighing <75 kg (see XXVI and Table 3) (strong,
moderate).
XX. What Alternative Agent(s) Can Be Used for a Person With Visceral
Leishmaniasis Who Cannot Tolerate Liposomal Amphotericin B or
Miltefosine or in Whom These Agents Otherwise Are Contraindicated?
Recommendations.
53. Pentavalent antimonial therapy (20 mg SbV/kg/day IV or
IM for 28 days) is a recommended therapy for immunocom-
petent persons with VL acquired in areas where the preva-
lence of antimony-resistant Leishmania species is low
(<10%) (strong, high).
54. We do not recommend switching to amphotericin B deox-
ycholate in persons with contraindications to, or substantial
toxicity with, L-AmB, with the exception of persons who de-
velop liposome-induced complement activation–related
pseudoallergy. Amphotericin B lipid complex is a consider-
ation in this situation (strong, low).
XXI. In Persons With Visceral Leishmaniasis, What Parameters Should
Be Used to Assess the Clinical Response to Treatment?
Recommendations.
55. Clinical parameters correlate well with parasitologic re-
sponses to VL treatment and should be used to monitor
the response (strong, low).
56. Parasitologic confirmation of response (such as by repeat
bone marrow aspiration for microscopy and culture after
treatment) is not recommended in a patient showing a timely
clinical response. Antibody levels fall but over many months
or longer (strong, moderate).
XXII. How Should a Person With Visceral Leishmaniasis Be Treated
Who Does Not Respond to Initial Therapy as Assessed by These
Parameters (or Who Has a Relapse)?
Recommendations.
57. Immunocompetent persons with VL who do not respond
to therapy with L-AmB should be treated with an alternative
drug or with a higher dose or a longer course of L-AmB
(strong, low).
58. Immunocompetent persons with VL who do not respond
to initial therapy with miltefosine or a pentavalent antimoni-
al compound should be treated with L-AmB or an alternative
drug if L-AmB is unavailable (strong, low).
59. Immunocompetent persons with VL who respond to ini-
tial therapy but subsequently have a relapse should be treated
with an alternative drug or with another, potentially longer,
course of therapy with the initial drug. If L-AmB was the
drug used for initial therapy, use of a higher dose can be con-
sidered (strong, low).
60. Combination therapies may be considered but have not
been well studied after therapeutic failure in persons with
VL (weak, low).
LEISHMANIASIS IN IMMUNOCOMPROMISED HOSTS
XXIII. How Should HIV/AIDS-Associated Visceral Leishmaniasis Be
Treated in Persons in North America, and What Other Management
Issues Should Be Considered?
Recommendations.
61. L-AmB is recommended for the treatment of VL in immu-
nocompromised persons in North America (Table 3) (strong,
low). Comment: The FDA-approved dosage regimen of L-
AmB for such persons, including those with concurrent
HIV/AIDS, is 4 mg/kg/day IV, on days 1–5, 10, 17, 24, 31,
and 38 (10 doses over a 38-day period), for a total dose of
40 mg/kg.
62. Combination therapy (eg, L-AmB plus miltefosine) might
be considered, especially for persons with refractory cases of
VL (weak, very low). Comment: The efficacy and optimal du-
ration of miltefosine monotherapy (and combination thera-
py) for HIV/AIDS-associated VL have not been established.
63. Because of the importance of effective immune reconstitu-
tion in HIV/VL-coinfected persons, antiretroviral therapy
(ART) should be initiated or optimized as soon as the person
is sufficiently stable to tolerate it (eg, either during or soon
after the initial course of therapy for VL) (strong, low).
64. Leishmania infection that becomes clinically manifest or
worsens after initiation of ART should be treated with anti-
leishmanial (and, if indicated, corticosteroid) therapy; leish-
maniasis-associated immune reconstitution inflammatory
syndrome reactions after initiation of ART have been report-
ed occasionally (strong, very low).
65. We recommend administering secondary prophylaxis
(chronic maintenance therapy) to decrease the risk for post-
treatment relapse of VL in persons with HIV/AIDS-associat-
ed immunosuppression (eg, CD4 T-lymphocyte counts
<200 cells/mm3) (strong, moderate).
66. Persons with VL and HIV/AIDS coinfection should be
monitored indefinitely (until effective immune reconstitution)
for evidence of posttreatment relapse; ART and secondary
prophylaxis provide only partial protection against relapse.
Antileishmanial treatment is indicated for persons who have
clinical and parasitologic evidence of recurrence (strong, low).
XXIV. How Should HIV/AIDS-Associated Cutaneous or Mucosal
Leishmaniasis Be Treated in Persons in North America Who Do Not
Have Evidence of Visceral Leishmaniasis, and What Other Management
Issues Should Be Considered?
Recommendations.
67. In HIV/AIDS-associated CL/ML, systemic antileishmanial
therapy is recommended, particularly in persons who are
e218 • CID 2016:63 (15 December) • Aronson et al
Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/cid/article-abstract/63/12/e202/2645609 by guest on 03 June 2019
 moderately to severely immunosuppressed (eg, have CD4+
T-lymphocyte counts <200–350 cells/mm3), who may be at
increased risk for suboptimal therapeutic responses, for post-
treatment relapses, and for cutaneous, mucosal, or visceral
dissemination (strong, very low).
68. The systemic regimens used for CL/ML in otherwise com-
parable immunocompetent persons typically are recom-
mended for the initial treatment of coinfected persons,
taking into account the potentials for drug interactions and
toxicity (Tables 3 and 4) (strong, very low). Comment:
Whether coinfected persons who experience multiple post-
treatment relapses of CL/ML would benefit from secondary
prophylaxis (chronic maintenance therapy) has not yet been
established.
69. ART should be initiated or optimized in accordance with
standard practice for HIV/AIDS; no evidence-based, CL/
ML-specific recommendations regarding ART have been es-
tablished (strong, low).
XXV. What Is the Preferred Treatment of Visceral/Cutaneous
Leishmaniasis in Immunocompromised Hosts With Solid Organ
Transplant, Persons With Lymphatic or Hematologic Malignancies, or
Persons Receiving Immunosuppressive Therapy for Other Reasons?
Recommendations.
70. L-AmB is recommended as the drug of choice for immu-
nosuppressed persons with VL (Table 3) (strong, low).
Comments: The FDA-approved regimen is 4 mg/kg/day
IV on days 1–5, 10, 17, 24, 31, and 38 (total dose of 40
mg/kg). Higher doses and longer durations of therapy
may be needed depending in part on the level of
immunosuppression.
71. Doses of immunosuppressive drugs should be decreased in
persons with VL during antileishmanial therapy whenever
possible (strong, very low).
72. Secondary prophylaxis is not recommended for initial
management in persons with VL who have not manifested
a relapse (weak, low). Comment: Immunosuppressed per-
sons with VL who are not coinfected with HIV typically
have higher response rates to initial treatment and lower re-
currence rates than HIV-coinfected persons.
73. Routine serologic screening of organ donors from leish-
maniasis-endemic areas is not recommended. If an available
donor is known to be seropositive, it is advisable to perform
clinical and laboratory monitoring of the recipient in the
posttransplant period rather than to reject the organ for
transplant (strong, low).
74. We suggest that clinicians not routinely perform diagnostic
testing to assess persons for evidence of asymptomatic viscer-
al infection, including persons who have lived or traveled in
leishmaniasis-endemic regions (Figure 3) and are consider-
ing organ transplantation or initiation of therapy with
biologic immunomodulating agents. Immunosuppressed
persons known or found to be asymptomatically infected
and those with a history of VL warrant close monitoring.
Neither preemptive treatment nor primary prophylaxis for
VL in asymptomatically infected persons is suggested
(weak, very low).
75. Immunosuppressed persons with VL who are not coinfect-
ed with HIV should be monitored for a minimum of 1 year
(ideally lifelong or until effective immune reconstitution) to
assess for posttreatment relapse. During clinical follow-up,
assess for symptoms and, if present, pursue parasitologic
confirmation of relapse (strong, very low).
76. Confirmed VL therapeutic failure typically can be managed
by retreatment using L-AmB at the same or a higher
total dose (strong, very low). Comment: Pentavalent anti-
monials could be used in some persons with VL under
close follow-up.
77. We suggest that CL/ML associated with the use of tumor
necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) antagonist therapy be man-
aged with systemic therapy and standard drug regimens for
the pertinent setting/species (eg, geographic area where the
infection was acquired) (weak, very low). Comment: With-
drawal of TNF-α antagonists during antileishmanial therapy
may be appropriate: the risks, benefits, and feasibility of this
action should be assessed on a case-by-case basis.
SPECIAL POPULATIONS AND LEISHMANIASIS
XXVI. How Should the Treatment of Leishmaniasis Be Modified in
Persons Who Are Pregnant or Lactating, Are Young Children or Older
Adults, or Have Comorbidities Such as Renal, Hepatic, or Cardiac
Dysfunction?
Recommendations.
78. In general, clinically manifest cases of VL and ML should
be treated even in these special populations of persons be-
cause the benefits of treatment typically outweigh the risks.
However, patient-specific factors, including the presence of
comorbid conditions, should be considered in the selection
of the antileishmanial therapy, dosage regimen, and moni-
toring approach (Table 4) (strong, low).
79. Decisions regarding whether and how to treat cases of CL
in persons with special characteristics or comorbid condi-
tions should take into account the potential risks and ben-
efits of various approaches, such as initially observing
without antileishmanial therapy, deferring treatment (eg,
until after pregnancy/delivery), and using local (vs system-
ic) therapy as the sole approach or as a temporizing mea-
sure, if otherwise appropriate and feasible (strong, very
low).

BACKGROUND
The term leishmaniasis refers to a diverse group of syndromes
caused by protozoa of the genus Leishmania, in the Leishman-
ia and Viannia subgenera. The clinical manifestations of in-
fection are variable and reflect a complex interplay between
the human host’s cell-mediated immune responses and the
virulence and tropism of the infecting Leishmania species,
>20 of which are known to be pathogenic for humans. Each
leishmaniasis-endemic region has particular combinations
of parasite species/strains, sand fly species, mammalian reser-
voir hosts (in zoonotic transmission cycles), and human hosts
with different genetic backgrounds. Although Leishmania in-
fection can be subclinical, the 3 main clinical syndromes are
cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL), mucosal leishmaniasis (ML),
and visceral leishmaniasis (VL). Less common presentations
include diffuse cutaneous leishmaniasis, disseminated cuta-
neous leishmaniasis, leishmaniasis recidivans, bubonic leish-
maniasis, uveitis, and post–kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis
(PKDL).
CL is the most common syndrome worldwide and the one
most likely to be encountered in patients in North America
(Figure 2). Although autochthonous CL cases acquired in
e220 • CID 2016:63 (15 December) • Aronson et al
Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/cid/article-abstract/63/12/e202/2645609 by guest on 03 June 2019
 Texas and Oklahoma have been reported, almost all of the cases
of CL evaluated in North America occur among immigrants, in-
ternational travelers, expatriates, and military personnel ex-
posed in leishmaniasis-endemic areas elsewhere in the world.
The skin lesions typically are first noticed at the site(s) where
Leishmania parasites were inoculated by an infected sand fly.
The lesions enlarge slowly and typically ulcerate after weeks
to months, although persistently nodular and other forms
also occur (Figure 4). The natural history is usually slow, spon-
taneous healing as cell-mediated immunity develops; healing
may be accelerated with antileishmanial treatment.
A minority of persons infected with Leishmania (V.) brazil-
iensis and related Viannia species in Latin America, particularly
in parts of South America, develop metastatic ML after healing
of CL or concomitantly with a cutaneous lesion(s). ML can pro-
gress to cause destructive lesions of the naso-oropharyngeal/la-
ryngeal mucosa. Leishmaniasis with mucosal lesions also has
been reported in the Old World, where the pathogenesis and
clinical manifestations of mucosal infection may be different.
VL is potentially life threatening and requires prompt evalua-
tion and treatment (Figure 3). In VL, amastigotes (the tissue
stage of the parasite) disseminate throughout the reticuloendo-
thelial system and occasionally are found in other organ
systems. VL, and less commonly CL or ML, may be opportunistic
infections in persons who are immunocompromised because of
human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/AIDS or other reasons.
Some experts consider all persons with symptomatic VL to be
immunocompromised, some perhaps without an identified im-
mune defect. In these guidelines, “immunocompetent VL” refers
to persons with VL without an identified immune defect.
Treatment of leishmaniasis can be challenging. The primary
goals of therapy for VL and CL are to prevent mortality and
morbidity, respectively. The only US Food and Drug Adminis-
tration (FDA)–approved medications for leishmaniasis are in-
travenous liposomal amphotericin B (L-AmB) for VL, and
oral miltefosine for CL, ML, and VL caused by particular spe-
cies. The potential for VL to be life threatening and the high re-
sponse rate associated with L-AmB therapy justify its side
effects and cost. Treatment recommendations for CL are less
straightforward, in part because the data from randomized con-
trolled trials are of variable quality and generalizability. Many
CL infections may clinically resolve without treatment. Further-
more, treatment does not necessarily result in parasitologic
cure, as evidenced by cases of relapse, especially in the context
of immunosuppression. The objective of treatment is clinical
healing, not parasitologic cure. For CL, the interrelated goals
of treatment include minimizing local tissue damage and cos-
metic or functional consequences, accelerating the rate of heal-
ing, reducing the likelihood of local recurrences, and decreasing
the risk of developing mucosal disease caused by parasites in the
Viannia subgenus. The therapeutic strategy depends in part on
the infecting species or, as a proxy, whether the infection was
acquired in the Americas (New World cutaneous leishmaniasis
[NWCL]) or elsewhere (Old World cutaneous leishmaniasis
[OWCL]). Local therapy may be an option for some cases of
CL, and use of systemic therapy may be indicated or prudent
for others.
Clinical resolution of leishmaniasis may not be associated
with a parasitologic cure, a definitive method to document par-
asitologic cure is not available, and even asymptomatic persons
may have low concentrations of blood/tissue parasites that
could cause infection in a transfusion/transplant recipient. We
suggest that persons with a history of leishmaniasis (particular-
ly, but not only, VL) refrain from donating blood; if organ/tissue
donation is contemplated pre- or postmortem, pertinent agen-
cies should be informed of the patient’s history of leishmaniasis.
The practices and policies for screening/deferring potential
North American donors for Leishmania infection not only
may change over time but also may vary among different places
or settings (eg, in the military vs the civilian sector), as well as
for different types of donations, which also might be processed
in ways that could decrease the number or the viability of resid-
ual parasites.
For prevention of leishmaniasis in travelers, no prophylactic
medications or vaccines are currently available. Healing of CL
may be associated with some protection from clinical disease
with subsequent exposure to the same Leishmania species/
strain; however, persons should be informed that clinically
manifest reinfection is possible and that they should use person-
al protective measures that minimize vector exposure whenever
they are in leishmaniasis-endemic areas. These measures in-
clude protective clothing, insect repellents such as DEET ap-
plied to exposed skin, permethrin applied to clothing,
window coverings, and insecticide-impregnated bed nets. Vec-
tor control with residual insecticides has been used in settings
with peridomestic transmission. Reservoir control depends in
part on the infecting Leishmania species.
METHODS
Panel Composition
The Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and the
American
Society of
Tropical
Medicine
and
Hygiene
(ASTMH) convened experts in the diagnosis and management
of leishmaniasis from the fields of diagnostic parasitology, pedi-
atrics, public health, tropical medicine, and infectious diseases,
including experts from leishmaniasis-endemic areas.
Literature Review and Analysis
Subgroups were formed, each responsible for developing rec-
ommendations and evidence support in the specific areas of di-
agnostic testing; treatment of cutaneous, mucosal, and visceral
leishmaniasis; and issues associated with immunocompromised
hosts and other special populations. Separate computerized
searches of Medline (primarily English language) through

 2014, with some updates in 2015, were performed for each clin-
ical question.
The Supplementary Appendix summarizes clinical trials re-
garding the treatment of cutaneous leishmaniasis, including
studies analyzed in 2 Cochrane reviews [2, 3]. We also included
clinical trials and pivotal observational data (particularly, if they
involved new therapies) identified through English-language
PubMed searches using the terms “leishmaniasis” and “treat-
ment,” starting with a 1-year overlap with the Cochrane reviews
and extending through January 2015. The Supplementary Ap-
pendix is organized to facilitate search by country of exposure,
Leishmania species, and treatment modality; it provides trans-
parent assessment of the quality of each study.
Process Overview
The evidence evaluation process was based on the IDSA Hand-
book on Clinical Practice Guideline Development (Figure 1).
In evaluating the evidence regarding the clinical management
of leishmaniasis, the Panel followed a process developed by
the Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development,
and Evaluation (GRADE) Working Group (http://www.
gradeworkinggroup.org/). This process utilizes a systematic
weighting of the quality of the evidence and an assessment of
the strength of the corresponding recommendation.
Consensus Development Based on Evidence
The Panel had several in-person meetings, and conducted
most of its work though monthly teleconferences and elec-
tronically based discussion during 2011–2016. All members
of the Panel participated in the preparation and review of
the draft guidelines, which were reviewed by the entire
Panel. Feedback via external peer review was also obtained.
The content of the guidelines and the manuscript was re-
viewed and approved by the IDSA and ASTMH guideline
steering committees and the respective Boards of Directors
before dissemination.
The subgroup-completed recommendations were discussed
by the Panel and were finalized by electronic survey in a 2-
phase process in which responses and justifications for respons-
es were anonymously summarized, revisions were made, and a
final survey vote reached consensus on the GRADE assigned. In
general, data from randomized controlled trials begin as “high”
quality, and data from observational studies begin as “low”
quality. However, the Panel may judge that particular features
of the data warrant decreasing or increasing the quality-of-
evidence rating; GRADE provides guidance on how various
factors should be weighed [4]. The strength assigned to a rec-
ommendation chiefly reflects the Panel’s confidence that the
benefits of following the recommendation are likely to outweigh
potential harms. Although the quality of evidence is an impor-
tant factor in assessing the strength of a recommendation, it is
not prescriptive.
Guidelines and Conflicts of Interest
The Panel complied with the IDSA policy on conflicts of inter-
est, which requires disclosure of any financial or other interest
that may be construed as constituting an actual, potential, or ap-
parent conflict. Panel members were provided IDSA’s conflicts
of interest disclosure statement and were asked to identify ties to
companies developing products that may be affected by pro-
mulgation of the guidelines. Information was requested regard-
ing employment, consultancies, stock ownership, honoraria,

BACKGROUND INFORMATION ABOUT
LEISHMANIASIS
What Clinical Manifestations Are Suggestive of Cutaneous
Leishmaniasis (CL)?
CL occurs in an afebrile person with a history of residence or
travel in a leishmaniasis-endemic area of the world (Figure 2)
who has one or more chronic skin lesions. The usually painless
lesions may be small or large, and nodular or ulcerative
(Figure 4). Induration of the lesions is typical but purulence is
not, unless lesion(s) are superinfected. Many persons do not re-
call being bitten by a sand fly and do not know how to distin-
guish sand flies from other small flying insects, but they still
should be asked about potential exposures to sand flies.
The morphologic characteristics and natural history of CL
depend in part on the infecting Leishmania species and the
host’s immunoinflammatory response. Clinically compatible
features of the lesions include well-defined, often indurated bor-
ders, chronicity, single or clustered lesions, and occurrence in
exposed skin areas. Lesions typically are painless unless secon-
darily infected or over a joint. There may be regional adenop-
athy,
subcutaneous
nodules
in
a
lymphatic
drainage
(“sporotrichoid”) pattern, and satellite papules. Single or multi-
ple lesions may occur where the parasite was inoculated by the
sand fly but also may occur distant to that site such as at the
sites of trauma [5]. The incubation period from inoculation to
clinical manifestations is usually at least several weeks [6]. The
lesions typically begin as papules, progress in size, and often ul-
cerate. Lesions may be chronic ulcers, papules, nodules, verru-
cous lesions, or plaques (Figure 4). Over time (months to years),
the lesions usually spontaneously heal, typically with residual
scarring.

 The clinical manifestations of CL in HIV-infected and HIV-
uninfected persons may be comparable, especially, but not only,
in coinfected persons with minimal immunosuppression
[7–10]. However, in general, the likelihood of having or devel-
oping atypical, multifocal, diverse, persistent, progressive, and
remitting-relapsing lesions increases in the contextof progressively
more severe immunosuppression [11,12].Lesions may be unusual
ininterrelatedrespects,suchastheirtype/appearance(eg,pleomor-
phic, nonulcerative, papulonodular lesions), size, number, and dis-
tribution on the skin and mucous membranes [7–9, 12–18].
The differential diagnosis includes cutaneous fungal and my-
cobacterial infections, cutaneous actinomycosis/nocardiosis,

 yaws, skin cancer, pyoderma gangrenosum, sarcoidosis, venous
stasis ulcers, cutaneous myiasis, spider bites, tropical ulcers,
prurigo nodularis, lichen simplex chronicus, fixed drug erup-
tions, and vasculitis. In the more acute stage, bacterial skin ab-
scesses, infected arthropod bites, and impetigo may be
considerations; in the appropriate epidemiologic and clinical
context, lack of response to antibacterial therapy should prompt
diagnostic testing for leishmaniasis.
In addition, a chronic syndrome (skin lesion, naso-oral
symptoms, or subacute febrile illness) associated with a granu-
lomatous inflammatory reaction on histopathology may suggest
leishmaniasis in persons with the appropriate history (even if
remote) [19].
What Clinical Manifestations Are Suggestive of New World Mucosal
Leishmaniasis (ML)?
The diagnosis of ML is a consideration in the appropriate epi-
demiologic context (Figure 2) in persons with compatible naso-
oropharyngeal/laryngeal symptoms or signs, especially if they
have evidence or a history of active or healed NWCL. However,
ML can develop in persons without a history of symptomatic
cutaneous infection or any physical evidence (eg, scars) of
prior CL. The interval from onset (or clinical resolution) of
CL to clinical manifestations of ML typically is several years
but may range from <30 days to decades.
Persistent nasal congestion/stuffiness is the most commonly
reported symptom [20,21];associated and interrelated manifes-
tations may include coryza, epistaxis, tissue/scab expulsion,
pruritus, mass sensation, blockage/obstruction, and hyposmia
[20, 22–27]. Persons with ML may have oral or pharyngeal le-
sions, bleeding, or pain; dysphagia/odynophagia; or dysphonia.
Isolated laryngeal disease, without involvement of other muco-
sal sites, may occur but is relatively unusual [22, 26].
Although ML typically does not directly affect the ears, in-
volvement of the rhinopharnyx may affect the orifice of the
Eustachian tube and thereby lead to “chronic secreting otitis
media,” the sensation of having a blocked ear, dyacusis, and
tinnitus [25, 28]. Abnormalities of the paranasal sinuses (eg,
detected via computed tomography) also have been reported
[21].
The differential diagnosis of ML includes infectious diseases
(eg, paracoccidioidomycosis, histoplasmosis, rhinosporidiosis,
rhinoscleroma, leprosy, tuberculosis, syphilis, tertiary yaws),
neoplastic diseases, and various other etiologies (eg, granuloma-
tosis with polyangiitis, sarcoidosis, intranasal cocaine use) [20,
25, 29, 30].
What Clinical Manifestations Are Suggestive of Visceral
Leishmaniasis (VL)?
VL presents in a person who has a history of residence or trav-
el in a leishmaniasis-endemic area of the world (Figure 3) and
develops a compatible clinical syndrome, which commonly in-
cludes chronic fever, weight loss, splenomegaly, pancytopenia,
eosinopenia, elevated liver enzymes, hypergammaglobuline-
mia, and variable hepatomegaly. There is a spectrum of se-
verity, and atypical presentations are common, especially in
persons who are immunocompromised (see XXIII and
XXV). The onset and course of VL are usually subacute or
chronic but can be acute. Risk factors for the acquisition of
VL include the bite of an infected sand fly but also needle
sharing, laboratory accident, or receipt of a blood transfusion
or organ transplant from an infected donor; uncommonly,
congenital/perinatal (and, rarely, sexual) transmission has
been reported. VL is a consideration even if the likely infection
was acquired years to decades earlier (latent infection can re-
activate). Immunocompromised persons with AIDS, organ
transplant recipients, and persons treated with biologic immu-
nomodulating drugs (eg, tumor necrosis factor alpha [TNF-α]
antagonists) are at increased risk for reactivation and dissem-
inated infection.
The spectrum of infection with Leishmania donovani and
Leishmania infantum-chagasi ranges from asymptomatic to
classic VL, or kala-azar, which is characterized by fever; other
constitutional symptoms, including malaise, loss of appetite,
and wasting; splenomegaly, which can become massive; hepato-
megaly; and various laboratory abnormalities, including hyper-
gammaglobulinemia, anemia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia,
hypoalbuminemia, elevated acute inflammatory markers, and
liver enzyme abnormalities. In addition, hyperpigmentation
may be observed in persons infected in India and Bangladesh.
Lymphadenopathy is seen in some persons in East Africa and
occasionally elsewhere. Fever may be intermittent; remittent,
with twice-daily temperature spikes; or, less commonly, contin-
uous. Detailed clinical descriptions of VL are available else-
where [31–33].
VL may be the first opportunistic infection in persons with
AIDS, and it often complicates the terminal stage of HIV infec-
tion in Leishmania-endemic areas [34]. The clinical manifesta-
tions of VL in HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected persons often
are qualitatively similar [11, 35–37], although some common
manifestations of VL (kala-azar), such as splenomegaly, may
be more subtle or absent in coinfected persons [38]. On the
other hand, in coinfected persons, Leishmania parasites may
be widely disseminated and found, often serendipitously, in
atypical sites and cells, in essentially any organ system (eg, the
gastrointestinal tract and skin), with or without clinical mani-
festations or relevance [11,38–42].Persons with HIV-associated
VL quite commonly have or develop dermatologic or mucosal
involvement [11, 43–48], which may mimic other pathologies
and may be localized or diffuse. Although PKDL most com-
monly is associated with L. donovani infection [37], in persons
with concurrent HIV/AIDS, PKDL also has been associated
with L. infantum-chagasi [49–54]. VL also occurs in persons
who are or become immunocompromised for reasons other
than HIV/AIDS (see XXV). The onset of clinical manifestations

 of VL may occur years or decades after the pertinent exposure
in persons who become immunocompromised.
Although the clinical manifestations may be suggestive of VL
in persons with exposure in a leishmaniasis-endemic area, they
are not specific. The differential diagnosis is broad. When the
onset is acute, it includes malaria, typhoid fever, typhus, acute
Chagas disease (in Latin America), acute schistosomiasis, mili-
ary tuberculosis, amebic liver abscess, mononucleosis, and viral
hepatitis. In subacute or chronic cases, the differential diagnosis
includes miliary tuberculosis, brucellosis, prolonged or recur-
rent Salmonella infections, subacute bacterial endocarditis, his-
toplasmosis or other disseminated fungal diseases, malaria with
tropical splenomegaly syndrome (hyperreactive malarial sple-
nomegaly syndrome), and hepatosplenic schistosomiasis with
portal hypertension. Some noninfectious causes include lym-
phoma, leukemia, other myeloproliferative diseases, rheuma-
toid arthritis with Felty syndrome, other autoimmune
processes, and the hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytic syn-
drome (which is also associated with VL).
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE DIAGNOSIS OF
LEISHMANIASIS (CUTANEOUS, MUCOSAL, AND
VISCERAL)
I. In a Person With a Compatible Skin Lesion(s) and Exposure History,
What Specimen(s) Should Be Collected for Diagnostic Testing for
Cutaneous Leishmaniasis?
Recommendations.
1. Tissue specimens should be collected from a lesion(s) when
a clinical suspicion for CL exists. Full-thickness skin biopsy
specimens allow for simultaneous testing for other diagnoses,
such as by histopathology and cultures (strong, moderate).
2. Obtain a sample from a cleansed lesion, from which cellular
debris and eschar/exudates have been removed (strong,
very low).
Evidence Summary
Samples for diagnosing CL should be collected from an active-
appearing (vs a nearly healed) skin lesion. Commonly used ap-
proaches for collecting samples include scraping or brushing
the debrided ulcer base or edges, aspirating lesions, and obtain-
ing skin snips or punch/shave biopsy specimens from an indu-
rated border. Additional details about specimen collection and
diagnostic methodologies for various presentations of CL are
provided elsewhere [55–57], including on the Centers for Dis-
ease Control and Prevention (CDC) website at http://www.
cdc.gov/parasites/leishmaniasis/diagnosis.html. For collection
of biopsy specimens (vs lesion aspirates or swabs), local anes-
thesia, such as with lidocaine plus epinephrine, typically is
used (unless the lesions are on the face, genitalia, or digits,
where epinephrine is not advised).
Which part of the skin lesion should be sampled to optimize
the likelihood of diagnosing CL? The results of several
comparisons of sampling the indurated edge vs the ulcer base
in NWCL (Guatemala and Colombia) have varied; the consen-
sus, especially with more sensitive polymerase chain reaction
(PCR)–based diagnostics, is that although the base has more
parasites, this may not matter clinically. Obtaining samples
from under the edge of the ulcer as well as from the base of
the lesion has been suggested [58–61]. The optimal sampling
site(s) for CL depends upon geographic variability; lesion age,
location, and other characteristics; Leishmania species; and
the sensitivity of the test procedure.
When initially evaluating a patient for CL, if laboratory sup-
port permits a quick assessment, it is useful to examine a scrap-
ing/aspirate/brushing or touch preparation from the lesion base,
near the periphery. The best specimens are obtained from a
well-cleaned, active-appearing lesion. Care should be taken to
scrape without eliciting bleeding, and then to transfer the ma-
terial onto a microscope slide for Giemsa staining and micros-
copy. The use of exudative material with minimal red blood
cells on a smear makes identification of amastigotes (either ex-
tracellular or within macrophages) easier than in paraffin-fixed
tissue sections. Alternatively, with the FDA clearance of the CL
detect immunochromatographic assay (InBios International,
Inc), the tissue brushing from an ulcerative lesion can be pro-
cessed with this rapid point-of-care assay (www.accessdata.fda.
gov/cdrh_docs/reviews/k141341.pdf).
Molecular-based testing, such as PCR analysis, is the most
sensitive diagnostic approach [62]. Improvement in the ease
and standardization of molecular techniques has led to in-
creased use of such assays. We recommend collecting tissue
for PCR analysis in 100% ethyl alcohol or by using the preferred
collection method of your reference laboratory; sterility is not
needed. For a diagnosis using PCR methodology, almost any
tissue specimen may be acceptable. The handling of the material
between sampling and testing is much more crucial. PCR anal-
ysis can identify Leishmania DNA in small tissue specimens,
such as in the scab overlying the lesion, as well as from deep
tissue (eg, dermal) specimens. Lesions that are not ulcerative
(a setting in which scraping may be less useful) or that are in
cosmetically sensitive areas, such as the face, genitalia, or digits
(where biopsy is less preferred), may be sampled by needle as-
piration. A needle aspirate samples 3–5 areas, using a 1- to 3-
mL syringe with a small needle (23–27G); some practitioners
use a small amount of preservative-free sterile saline and inject
then withdraw, whereas others use a dry syringe with a back-
and-forth needle incursion into the lesion, simultaneously ro-
tating and applying suction to the syringe for collection of a
small drop of tissue fluid in the syringe. This fluid can be
smeared on a slide and stained, and the aspiration procedure
can be repeated for culture and PCR.
For Leishmania culture specimens, use sterile technique:
Avoid leaving residual iodine or alcohol on the lesion, which
may interfere with culture yield. Full-thickness punch biopsy

 samples are usually obtained from the indurated edge of the
skin lesion, where histology may have fewer degradation chang-
es. In general, shave or punch biopsy specimens are recom-
mended when the pretest likelihood of leishmaniasis is lower
(the differential diagnosis is broad) or when initial less-invasive
sampling methods (such as brushing, scraping, or aspirating) do
not identify an etiology.
II. In a Person With Manifestations Suggestive of New World Mucosal
Leishmaniasis, What Types of Specimens Should Be Obtained for
Diagnostic Testing?
Recommendations.
3. The initial and most prominent mucosal manifestations typ-
ically are nasal (eg, chronic unexplained congestion/secre-
tions). Oral/palatal, pharyngeal, and laryngeal involvement
may develop as ML progresses or, in some persons, may be
the first or the only noted abnormalities. The clinical signs,
which may evolve over time, may include erythema, edema,
hyperemia, infiltration, nodules, erosion, ulceration, and tis-
sue destruction (eg, perforation of the nasal septum) (fact, no
grade).
4. Mucosal areas that have macroscopic abnormalities are rec-
ommended for specimen collection; biopsy specimens, ob-
tained by an otolaryngologist, are useful for confirming the
diagnosis by molecular and traditional methods and for ex-
cluding other etiologies (strong, low).
Evidence Summary
Many of the principles regarding specimen collection for diag-
nosis of CL also apply to ML; however, for ML, biopsy speci-
mens typically should be collected by an otolaryngologist or
other experienced specialist. In advance of the examination,
the referring physician and otolaryngologist should discuss
the differential diagnosis and the importance of assessing the
anatomic extension and clinical severity of mucosal disease (if
present), including the potential for respiratory obstruction. De-
tails regarding specimen collection, handling, and testing for
leishmaniasis and other potential etiologies should be discussed
in advance with the pertinent laboratories.
In general, ML is a pauciparasitic syndrome [20, 63, 64],
which underscores the utility of molecular amplification meth-
ods. However, obtaining mucosal specimens for Leishmania
testing—even via relatively noninvasive means (eg, via nasal
swab or cytologic brush [24, 30, 65])—typically is not recom-
mended for persons who do not have any macroscopic mucosal
abnormalities. Because mucosal dissemination is more com-
mon than mucosal disease per se [24], detecting the parasite/
DNA in naso-oropharyngeal mucosa does not suffice to diag-
nose ML. The risk factors for the development of ML are poorly
understood (see XII), as are the factors that affect the progres-
sion and anatomic extension of ML over time. Investigational
testing for the presence of Leishmania RNA virus (a purported
virulence factor) is not readily available, nor, to date, has it been
found useful for identifying persons who may have or be at risk
for ML [66].
III. During the Initial and Subsequent Evaluations of Persons With
Cutaneous Leishmaniasis Acquired in Central or South America Who
May Have or Be at Risk for Mucosal Leishmaniasis, What Should Be
Done to Assess the Possibility of Mucosal Disease?
Recommendations.
5. All persons at risk for ML—on the basis of the etiologic
agent of the Leishmania infection, if known, and the region
in the New World in which infection was acquired—should
be questioned about and examined for mucosal symptoms
and signs, respectively, even during the initial evaluation
(strong, low).
6. During all evaluations (ie, initial and subsequent), persons
at risk for ML should be questioned explicitly about the de-
velopment, evolution, and other characteristics of mucosal
symptoms; and they should have a thorough examination
of the naso-oropharyngeal mucosa even if they do not have
any mucosal symptoms (strong, low).
7. Persons at risk for ML should be educated and provided per-
sonalized documentation about the importance of seeking
medical attention for possible ML if they ever develop persis-
tent, atypical (unusual for the person) naso-oropharyngeal/
laryngeal manifestations that do not have a clear etiology
(strong, low).
8. Persons at risk for ML who have persistent mucosal symp-
tom(s) or compatible abnormalities of the naso-oropharyn-
geal mucosa should be referred to a specialist for an
otorhinolaryngologic examination, which typically should
include fiber-optic endoscopy (strong, low).
9. Clinicians might refer some at-risk persons without docu-
mented mucosal symptoms or signs to an otolaryngologist,
especially if it was not possible to conduct a thorough review
of systems and mucosal examination or if the assessments
may not have been adequate or reliable (weak, very low).
Evidence Summary
In New World ML, the anterior nasal septum is the most
commonly involved area [22, 25, 63, 67], which, in contrast
to the posterior nose, may be readily accessed even by non-
otolaryngologists [20, 22]. Dried nasal secretions, if any,
should be removed before beginning the examination. The
external contour of the nose often is normal even in persons
whose nasal septum has perforated, whereas the perforation
may be palpated with the index and forefinger and may be
visualized after lifting up the tip of the nose and shining a
light at a diagonal angle inside the nares. The speculum
examination of the nose may be facilitated by bending the
nose from side to side. The oral cavity and pharynx should
be inspected using a tongue depressor and a light; to visualize
the entire hard palate, ask the patient to tip back his/her
head [22].

Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/cid/article-abstract/63/12/e202/2645609 by guest on 03 June 2019
 The potential utility of otorhinolaryngologic examination for
early detection of ML in persons with NWCL was evaluated in
an L. (V.) braziliensis–endemic area of Bahia State, Brazil [68].
Among 220 consecutive persons with active CL who had a
“careful” otorhinolaryngologic examination (anterior rhino-
scopy, oropharyngeal examination, mirror laryngoscopy, and,
if indicated, fiber-optic examination), concomitant ML was di-
agnosed in 6 persons (2.7%). All 6 persons were immunocom-
petent, and none had a history of CL or a compatible cutaneous
scar; their cutaneous lesions had been present for 15–30 days (in
4 persons) or for 8 months (in 2 persons). ML was diagnosed
during the persons’ initial evaluation. Five of the 6 persons
had mucosal disease that was restricted to the nose; the other
patient, who was 1 of the 2 persons with an 8-month history
of CL, had “pharyngeal and laryngeal involvement and had a
nasal septal perforation.” The publication about the study
[68] did not address whether any of the identified cases of
ML would have been missed altogether if the 2-step approach
described above in recommendations 5–8 had been followed
—that is, if complete otorhinolaryngologic examinations had
been reserved for persons who had mucosal symptoms or
signs that were detected via thorough assessments by
nonspecialists.
The utility of a complete otorhinolaryngologic examination
(anterior rhinoscopy, oropharyngeal examination, and a
fiber-optic examination) for excluding ML was addressed by
the same group of investigators in a study in Acre State, Brazil
[29]. Among 44 persons with a clinical diagnosis of ML—ie, a
nasal “clinical complaint” plus either a positive Leishmania
skin test, a positive serologic result, or a previous diagnosis
of CL—only 13 persons (29%) had evidence of active ML
(10 persons) or healed/scarred mucosal disease (3 persons
who already had been treated). Eight of the 10 previously un-
treated persons consented to having a biopsy specimen ob-
tained; all 8 had positive Leishmania PCR results. Likely
alternative diagnoses (eg, allergic or atrophic rhinitis or
chronic sinusitis) were identified for the persons who did
not have evidence of ML.
A complete otorhinolaryngologic examination also may be
warranted in persons who have disseminated CL—a syndrome
distinct from localized and diffuse CL that has been reported
primarily in northern and northeastern Brazil and that is asso-
ciated with an increased risk for concomitant ML, particularly
in persons with head or neck lesions [69, 70].
IV. In a Person With a Compatible Clinical Course and Epidemiologic
Context, What Types of Samples Should Be Collected to Evaluate for the
Diagnosis of Visceral Leishmaniasis?
Recommendations.
10. We recommend the collection of tissue aspirates or biopsy
specimens for smears, histopathology, parasite culture, and
molecular testing (strong, low).
11. Bone marrow aspiration is the preferred first source of a
diagnostic sample. Liver, enlarged lymph nodes, and whole
blood (buffy coat) are other potential sources of tissue spec-
imens (strong, low).
12. Serum should be collected for detection of antileishmanial
antibodies (see VIII) (strong, moderate).
13. In immunocompromised persons, blood should be collect-
ed for buffy coat examination, in vitro culture, and molecular
analyses (strong, very low).
Evidence Summary
While there are several approaches to the diagnosis of VL, we
recommend that the diagnosis be obtained by collection of tis-
sue aspirates and/or biopsy specimens for microscopy (smears
from aspirates and impression preparations from tissue), histo-
pathology, parasite culture, and molecular testing (PCR) from
venous blood and tissues [71, 72]. The specificity of microscopy
for the diagnosis of VL is high, but its sensitivity varies among
the tissues sampled, ranging from positive diagnoses in spleen
(93%–99%), bone marrow (52%–85%), and lymph node aspi-
rates (52%–58%) [73, 74]. Splenic aspiration is not recommend-
ed as part of the diagnostic evaluation for VL for persons in
North America. Aspiration of the spleen is the most likely to
yield a diagnosis but encumbers risk; life-threatening hemor-
rhages have been reported [75]. Bone marrow aspiration is
less sensitive but safer and is the preferred first source of diag-
nostic sample. Liver, enlarged lymph nodes, and/or even whole
blood are other potential sources of tissue specimens. In immu-
nocompromised persons with VL, samples from atypical sites
(eg, gastrointestinal tract, bronchoalveolar lavage, pleural
fluid, skin) may yield a diagnosis.
Serology with an rK39-based immunochromatographic test
[76, 77] may provide supportive evidence for a diagnosis of
VL, but it is not recommended as a stand-alone VL diagnostic
test; however, it may be useful to direct more invasive testing
(see VIII).
A quantitative PCR (qPCR) assay is sensitive and specific
when Leishmania parasitemia is >10 parasites/mL in the venous
blood (see VII) [78, 79]. Using a peripheral blood buffy coat
sample for concentration before molecular testing is gaining
widespread acceptance; a qualitative result can be obtained.
However, because of the lack of standardization of the assay/
target and undefined performance characteristics in North
American reference laboratories (Table 2), we do not currently
recommend using this evolving technique as first-line testing
for VL.
V. What Laboratory Tests Should Be Used to Diagnose Leishmaniasis?
Recommendations.
14. We recommend using multiple diagnostic approaches to
maximize the likelihood of a positive Leishmania result,
using methods such as visualization of the characteristic

 amastigote in smears or tissue (histopathology); parasite iso-
lation by in vitro culture; molecular detection of parasite
DNA; and, for VL, serologic testing (see VI–VIII and
Table 2). Simultaneous testing for other diagnoses (eg, by
histopathology and culture) should be considered (strong,
low).
15. We recommend attempting parasite isolation with the as-
sistance of reference laboratories. We recommend that clini-
cians contact their leishmaniasis reference laboratory before
collecting specimens (Table 2). If Leishmania parasites are
isolated in culture, reference laboratories can identify the
species by DNA-based assays or isoenzyme analysis (strong,
low).
16. Molecular amplification assays typically should be per-
formed because they are the most sensitive Leishmania
tests currently available (see VII) (strong, moderate).
17. Leishmania skin testing is not recommended or available in
the United States or Canada; there are no standardized, ap-
proved, or commercially available skin-test products in
North America (strong, very low).
Evidence Summary
There is currently no one, single “gold-standard” test for the di-
agnosis of leishmaniasis. Rather, a group of tests is typically per-
formed: light-microscopic examination of tissue smears or
sections (histopathology) for the presence of amastigotes, the
tissue stage of the parasite; in vitro culture to isolate the parasite;
DNA amplification assays; and, in VL, serologic testing. Many
of these assays require reference laboratory support (Table 2). It
is helpful to contact the leishmaniasis laboratory in advance to
optimize specimen collection and transport.
Microscopy is the most widely available, but it does not allow
for identification of the causative Leishmania species. Microsco-
py requires the visualization of Leishmania amastigotes (includ-
ing cell membrane, cytoplasm, nucleus, and, in particular, the
extranuclear rod-shaped kinetoplast) in tissue specimens by
light microscopy with oil immersion at ×1000 magnification
[80]. Parasites can be seen using routine hematoxylin and
eosin, Giemsa, or Wright-Giemsa stains. The morphologic
identification of amastigotes is easier in smears than in tissue
sections. The usual 3- to 5-µm thickness of tissue sections
makes it more difficult to confirm the presence of a kinetoplast;
thin sections are sometimes helpful. Trypanosoma cruzi amas-
tigotes may also be seen in tissue specimens. Diagnostic confu-
sion can result, particularly in immunosuppressed organ
transplant recipients with skin lesions suggestive of CL that ac-
tually are caused by T. cruzi infection. Histoplasma capsulatum
is of similar size but does not have a kinetoplast [55].Diagnostic
confusion can also result between VL and histoplasmosis in re-
gions where histoplasmosis is endemic, a problem exacerbated
by the response of both to empiric antifungal therapy (eg, with
amphotericin B formulations). Although a relatively rapid
method of discerning whether Leishmania parasites are present
(histopathology takes 1–3 days to process, whereas smears and
touch preparations take less time), microscopy requires substan-
tial technical expertise. Biopsy quality and the usual 3- to 5-µm
thickness of tissue sections may be factors that contribute to the
relatively low sensitivity of histopathology, which has been esti-
mated to be 50%–70% in aggregate for Old World species and
15%–30% for the New World species [81].
A new point-of-care rapid diagnostic test, CL Detect (InBios
International, Inc), has been FDA cleared for use in ulcerative
CL skin lesions, with sampling of early (<4 months old) lesions.
This qualitative immunochromatographic assay (test strip) re-
portedly has limits of detection of approximately 200 parasites
for OWCL species and 1000–1440 parasites for NWCL species.
In a study of OWCL in Tunisia, the sensitivity of the test was
96% and the specificity was 90.5% (www.accessdata.fda.gov/
cdrh_docs/reviews/k141341.pdf).
If possible, parasite isolation (by culture) should be attempt-
ed because it provides parasitologic confirmation of the diagno-
sis and the isolate can be used for additional testing, if indicated.
Some reference laboratories provide culture and transport
media (Table 2). Leishmania are fastidious and it can take
weeks for cultures to become positive; therefore, therapy is
often initiated on the basis of other test results. Once a parasite
is isolated, species identification is routinely performed at CDC,
Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (WRAIR), and other
World Health Organization (WHO) reference laboratories by
isoenzyme analysis and, more recently, DNA-based assays
(Table 2). Despite providing a definitive diagnosis of Leishman-
ia infection, culture is not a highly sensitive diagnostic method.
Many specimens contain nonviable organisms or may become
contaminated during collection or transport. An estimated
44%–60% of specimens yield parasites that can be expanded
in culture and maintained in the laboratory [80]. Recently,
MALDI-TOF (matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization–
time of flight) has been used to assist with rapid species identi-
fication of cultured promastigotes [82, 83].
PCR analysis detects Leishmania DNA in tissue specimens
(see VII and Table 2). There are many Leishmania molecular
assays with different targets and performance characteristics.
The advantage of this approach is that it can provide diagnostic
results within 24 hours (although, in practice, it takes longer), is
not dependent on having viable organisms, and typically has
high sensitivity and specificity [62]. Depending on the primers
and target sequence selected, one can identify the Leishmania
genus, a subgenus complex, or a particular Leishmania species.
Immunologic diagnostic methods include serologic and de-
layed-type hypersensitivity testing (Leishmania skin test). Nei-
ther can distinguish past from current infection. Serologic
testing (see VIII) is recommended for persons with suspected
VL in whom definitive diagnostic tests for the parasite (micro-
scopic identification, culture, and molecular tests for parasite

 DNA) cannot be conducted or have negative results. Serologic
tests are not reliable for the diagnosis of CL. Skin testing is not
recommended or available in the United States or Canada for
any form of leishmaniasis. There are no standardized, approved,
or commercially available products in North America. Delayed-
type cutaneous hypersensitivity responses to leishmanial anti-
gens are typically not observed in untreated persons with
kala-azar and are variably seen with L. infantum-chagasi.
VI. In a Person With Leishmaniasis, Why Could It Be Helpful to Identify
the Infecting Leishmania Species?
Recommendation
18. We suggest that identification of the infecting parasite to
the species level be attempted in cases of suspected CL. Spe-
cies identification may help inform clinical management de-
cisions for individual persons (eg, whether and how to treat)
(weak, moderate).
Evidence Summary
Although Leishmania species identification is not necessary to
confirm the diagnosis of CL, ML, or VL, identifying the species
can help inform clinical management decisions for individual
persons. For example, species identification stratifies potential
risk for associated ML, allows estimates of the natural history
of the infection, and may help predict the response to a partic-
ular therapy (see XII and XIII). If the individual situation is
such that none of these factors are assessed to be relevant, spe-
cies identification may be foregone or treatment may be initiat-
ed before the species results are available. However, species
identification should be pursued if a person has a complex res-
idence/travel history (if >1 species is found in the pertinent re-
gion[s] and infection caused by those species have clinically
relevant differences that affect choice of treatment, the dose/du-
ration of therapy, the prognosis, and posttreatment monitor-
ing), became infected in the “mucosal belt” of South America
(Table 1), is immunocompromised, or has comorbidities that
may affect the treatment risk-benefit assessment (eg, young or
old age, pregnancy or lactation, liver or renal disease; see XXVI
and Table 4). Classically, species identification has been accom-
plished using multilocus enzyme electrophoresis (MLEE) with
culture-adapted parasites. Molecular techniques often allow
rapid species identification directly from tissue, from many dif-
ferent available specimen sources, with the caveat that the assays
may not have been fully characterized and validated [84]. In ad-
dition, there may be irreconcilable discrepancies between the
molecular and the MLEE results.
These recommendations are based on clinical experience and
a summary of the limited available data as outlined in a recent
review article about species-directed therapy [85]. Decisions re-
garding clinical management also must take into account the
availability (or lack thereof) and feasibility of particular thera-
peutic options.
VII. What Is the Role of DNA-Based Assays in the Diagnosis of
Leishmaniasis?
Recommendation
19. DNA-based assays should be performed, especially if other
diagnostic testing is unrevealing. They are emerging as the
most sensitive assays for the diagnosis of leishmaniasis
(strong, moderate).
Evidence Summary
In North America, DNA-based molecular assays should be per-
formed if direct visualization of the parasite is unsuccessful and
the index of suspicion is high for any form of leishmaniasis.
These assays include conventional PCR, real-time PCR, nucleic
acid–based amplification, and loop-mediated isothermal ampli-
fication. They are the preferred methodology where experienced
microscopists are not readily available. They are currently the
most sensitive assays for the detection of Leishmania species
and are particularly useful in situations where few parasites
are present [62, 86–89]. A key point is that there is no single
standard Leishmania PCR assay, and many assays differ with
respect to parasite targets and performance characteristics.
For example, current PCR targets at North American reference
laboratories vary—eg, glucose-6-phosphate isomerase, cathep-
sin L–like cysteine protease B gene, and leishmanial ribosomal
RNA (rRNA).
Samples for PCR analysis do not have to be sterilely collected
and can be inoculated onto filter paper and dried, allowing for
specimen preservation and easy transport. Although the pre-
ferred sample is a fresh tissue specimen preserved in absolute
alcohol, PCR assays are also useful in identifying the Leishman-
ia species in paraffin-fixed tissue and cultured isolates. For per-
sons with HIV/AIDS, quantitative Leishmania loads in the
blood, buffy coat, and bone marrow are used in VL manage-
ment [89,90].Although PCR-based assays are not commercially
available in North America, molecular analyses are performed
at reference laboratories such as at CDC and WRAIR in the
United States and at the National Reference Centre for Parasi-
tology in Montreal, Canada, as well as at other WHO leishman-
iasis collaborating centers worldwide (Table 2). Quantitative
PCR is not available in any North American reference laborato-
ry as of the time of writing these guidelines; however, clinicians
should contact reference laboratory directors for updated infor-
mation about availability.
Potential limitations of these molecular methods include the
requirement for technical training and the need to avoid speci-
men contamination [91]. Other issues include the infrequent
validation of the assay for the geographic area where the infec-
tion was acquired and a need for contextual assurance that the
assay result is consistent with the potential region of exposure
[92]. Real-time PCR methodology has been developed, which
uses fluorescent signal as an indicator of amplification products.
This approach is an improvement over older PCR methods; it is

 highly specific, less labor intensive (which reduces the risk for
contamination), and provides results in <1 hour (although, in
practice, it takes longer) [93].
MLEE, which is technically complex and time-consuming, is
a potentially more powerful methodology than molecular anal-
ysis for the identification of Leishmania species, but it needs
cultured parasites and lacks the discriminatory power of
newer techniques like multilocus sequence typing [94].
MALDI-TOF—a technology that is being widely introduced
into clinical microbiology laboratories in North America—
recently was reported to assist in the diagnosis of leishmaniasis
and to identify the Leishmania species [83].
VIII. What Is the Role of Serologic Testing in the Diagnosis of
Leishmaniasis?
Recommendation
20. Serologic testing is recommended for persons with suspect-
ed VL in whom definitive diagnostic tests for the parasite
(microscopic identification, culture, and molecular tests for
parasite DNA) cannot be conducted or have negative results.
The sensitivity and specificity of serologic tests depend on the
assay and antigens used, as well as host factors. Serologic tests
cannot be used to assess the response to treatment. Antileish-
manial antibodies can be detected years after clinically suc-
cessful therapy in some persons (strong, moderate).
21. We suggest that tests for antileishmanial antibodies not be
performed as the sole diagnostic assay. Antibodies may be
undetectable or present at low levels in persons with VL
who are immunocompromised because of concurrent HIV/
AIDS or other reasons. The potential for false-negative test
results limits the utility of serologic assays in this setting
(weak, low).
22. Serologic testing is not recommended as part of the diag-
nostic evaluation for CL. The currently available serologic as-
says are neither sensitive nor specific for the diagnosis of CL
(strong, moderate).
Evidence Summary
A number of assays can be used to detect antileishmanial anti-
bodies. The sensitivity and specificity vary depending on the
leishmanial antigen(s) and platform used as well as the patient
populations studied. Whole or solubilized promastigotes and
recombinant antigens have been used.
The best characterized is the recombinant K39 kinesin-like
antigen expressed by amastigotes cloned from L. infantum-cha-
gasi [95,96].In the United States, the immunochromatographic
dipstick (Kalazar Detect, InBios International, Inc, Seattle,
Washington) is an FDA-cleared diagnostic test. In a meta-anal-
ysis of 13 publications [97], the sensitivity and specificity of the
rK39 dipstick for symptomatic VL in populations unlikely to
have HIV/AIDS were 94% and 91%, respectively. The sensitiv-
ity was higher in studies conducted in South Asia [98]and Latin
America [99] than in East Africa [100, 101], where the sensitiv-
ity reportedly ranged from 75% to 85% and the specificity from
70% to 92% [102, 103]. The specificity tends to be highest in
healthy control populations [97]. False-positive rK39 reactions
have been reported in Latin America in persons with Chagas
disease or CL [99]. On occasion, the rK39 results are positive
in asymptomatic persons infected with L. donovani or L. infan-
tum-chagasi, including persons who may later progress to de-
velop VL. Unfortunately, assays for antileishmanial antibodies
are not helpful as a test of cure. In a study of 780 persons treated
for VL in India, antibodies to rK39 were assessed using an en-
zyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) format. The titers
decreased rapidly during the first 12 months following treat-
ment but then declined slowly, with 39% of patients still sero-
positive >15 years after treatment [104]. The presence of
antileishmanial antibodies years after treatment for VL has
been reported in cohort studies performed in India, South
America, and East Africa [95].
Some North American laboratories perform indirect immu-
nofluorescence assays (IFAs) or ELISA using crude promasti-
gote or other characterized leishmanial antigens. The
sensitivity and specificity vary with the platform and antigens
used, as well as the threshold for considering a result positive
[95, 105]. False-positive results have been reported in persons
with CL, Chagas disease, leprosy, tuberculosis, typhoid fever,
malaria, and other diseases [106, 107]. The National Reference
Centre for Parasitology in Montreal, Canada, offers Leishman-
ia IFA testing. There is also a direct agglutination test (Dutch
TB Laboratory Partnership, Royal Tropical Institute, Amster-
dam), using whole Leishmania promastigotes, that has been
evaluated in a number of leishmaniasis-endemic areas. In a
meta-analysis [97], the sensitivity and specificity were report-
ed to be 95% and 86%, respectively. This assay is not available
in North America.
Antileishmanial antibodies may be diminished or undetect-
able in persons who are coinfected with HIV/AIDS. In a recent
meta-analysis, the sensitivity in persons coinfected with HIV/
AIDS ranged from 51% to 84% and the specificity from 82%
to 93%, depending on the assay [108]. In studies in Ethiopia
and Brazil [109, 110], 77% and 82% of persons with concurrent
VL and HIV/AIDS were seropositive using rK39-based assays.
However, in solid organ transplant recipients [79] and a few
cases of persons treated with TNF-α antagonists [101], serologic
tests have not appeared to be of reduced sensitivity in persons
with VL.
The Kalazar Detect (InBios International, Inc) test for anti-
bodies against rK39 is known to have poor sensitivity in persons
with CL. In a cohort of otherwise healthy military personnel
who had CL (mainly OWCL), the sensitivity of the rK39 dip-
stick assay was 10.2% and that of the rK39 ELISA was 28.8%
[111]. In a study of 242 persons with confirmed CL in an L.
(V.) braziliensis–endemic area in Brazil, none tested positive

 with the dipstick assay [112]. A number of other studies of se-
rologic responses in CL have used leishmanial antigens derived
from cultured promastigotes. The Leishmania species, the
methods of antigen preparation, and the platforms have varied
widely, as have the reported sensitivities and specificities [81].
On the basis of the available data, serologic testing is not recom-
mended for the diagnostic evaluation of CL.
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE TREATMENT OF
CUTANEOUS LEISHMANIASIS
IX. In a Person With a Consistent Travel History and Compatible Skin
Lesion(s), Is It Necessary to Obtain Parasitologic Confirmation of the
Diagnosis of Leishmaniasis Before Starting Treatment?
Recommendation
23. After a careful diagnostic evaluation in which neither leish-
maniasis nor another diagnosis is confirmed, empiric treat-
ment may be indicated on the basis of an individualized
risk-benefit assessment (weak, very low). Comment: This
should be discussed with the patient and reevaluated period-
ically, taking into account the clinical evolution.
Evidence Summary
This recommendation derives from opinion based on clinical
experience. We strongly prefer to have a confirmed diagnosis
to inform treatment and to provide prognostic information;
otherwise, we manage the skin lesion(s) as a calculated risk-
benefit decision. Clinical appearance (see Background) must
be suggestive, although a variety of appearances are possible.
Certainly, one should first ascertain that CL is endemic and
plausible in the region of exposure (Figure 2). Knowing what
species of CL are endemic there also may be helpful [85]. CL
may occur in clusters of exposed persons (eg, in travelers or mil-
itary groups); if efforts to make a specific diagnosis (particularly
in NWCL) fail to confirm the presence of parasites, the pretest
likelihood that the clinical manifestations and epidemiology are
compatible with CL should be considered—for example, if fel-
low travelers have confirmed cases of CL, the likelihood that a
person with skin lesions has CL is higher.
Leishmania (V.) braziliensis CL and leishmaniasis recidivans
(L. tropica) persisting for many months may have fewer para-
sites present, thus making diagnostic confirmation difficult
[113, 114]. The availability of diagnostic molecular methods
has increased the sensitivity of detection, such that negative
test results are less likely (see VII). In this circumstance, obtain-
ing a skin biopsy specimen to look for other etiologies may be
helpful. The histopathologic milieu of CL may include well-
formed granulomas but also lymphocytic/plasma cell infiltra-
tion; the stratum corneum may be hypertrophied and can
also be ulcerated with necrosis [115].
If the exposure was south of Nicaragua (ie, in Costa Rica or
further south), particularly in the so-called mucosal belt in
South America, concern about risk for mucosal involvement
may prompt empiric treatment based on clinical impression.
This, as well as the potential toxicities associated with particular
medications (Table 4), should be considered in individualized
treatment decisions. Oral miltefosine, which recently became
available in the United States, may have a role in this circum-
stance, although it also can be associated with adverse effects.
OWCL skin lesions can often be treated with nonspecific
local measures, which also could be indicated for other similarly
appearing conditions and are associated with less toxicity than
available systemic agents.
X. Is Treatment of Clinically Manifest Cutaneous Infection Always
Indicated?
Recommendations.
24. We recommend that immunocompetent persons with skin
lesions that are caused by infection with Leishmania species
that are not associated with increased risk for ML, that are
defined as clinically simple lesions (Table 1), and that are
healing spontaneously may be observed without treatment
if the patient concurs with this management (strong,
moderate).
25. For persons with CL when the Leishmania species is not
known but the infection was not acquired in an increased
ML-risk region (Table 1, Figure 2), treatment of clinically
simple or healing skin lesions is not required in an immuno-
competent patient who concurs with this management
(strong, low; E. C. dissents, recommending that all persons
with NWCL receive treatment). Comment: See XXIV and
XXV regarding the management of CL in immunocompro-
mised persons.
26. We suggest that systemic treatment be offered for persons
even with healing/recently healed CL lesions caused by in-
creased ML-risk species or when the species is unknown
but the infection was acquired in an increased ML-risk re-
gion. Risks and benefits of such treatment should be dis-
cussed with the patient (weak, low). Comment: In some
cases, watchful waiting, with vigilance for signs and symp-
toms of ML, may be a reasonable approach.
27. We recommend that any decision to observe a patient with
CL without treatment should be reevaluated periodically, and
the decision not to treat should be reconsidered if healing
does not progress as anticipated (strong, very low).
28. In all cases of CL, wound care, individualized documenta-
tion of lesion evolution, and patient education regarding the
manifestations and detection of local therapeutic failure/re-
lapse and ML should be routine components of management
(see III and XV) (strong, low).
Evidence Summary
These guidelines assume a setting with ready access to medical
resources and availability of the most relevant treatment modal-
ities. Persons with CL will be involved in the assessment of risks

 and benefits associated with treatment, and potential legal lia-
bilities for adverse outcomes will require consideration as
well. These factors may lead to recommendations that differ
from those in some leishmaniasis-endemic areas.
When deciding whether to treat a case of CL, one must con-
sider the goals of treatment. CL can lead to morbidity but does
not directly cause mortality. The primary goal is to accelerate
healing of the lesion(s) and, thereby, to minimize tissue dam-
age, scarring, and disfigurement; appropriate treatment is also
thought to reduce the risk for subsequent therapeutic failure, in-
cluding ML.
In some instances, at the time of diagnosis, lesions already
will show evidence of spontaneous healing. Some lesions may
also be considered “simple,” in the sense that they are uncom-
plicated (Table 1) and seem unlikely to lead to substantial mor-
bidity. In particular, the lesions are small in size, are few in
number, and are not localized on parts of the body with the po-
tential for cosmetic or functional consequences.
When assessing whether treatment may be indicated, there
are several patient categories to consider:
1.
Known species, low ML risk, clinically benign lesions: The
infection was acquired in the Old World or it was acquired in
the New World but is known to be caused by a species not in the
Viannia subgenus or is caused by a Viannia species from a re-
gion north of Costa Rica. In addition, the lesions are clinically
benign or reportedly are spontaneously healing, and the patient
is not immunocompromised. In these cases, the risks for ML
and other complications are low and observation is a reasonable
approach. However, persons with lesions that are not shown to
heal subsequently may be offered treatment.
2.
Region of acquisition known, low ML risk, clinically benign
lesions: The infecting species is unknown, but infection was ac-
quired in a region where ML is rare. In addition, the lesions are
clinically benign or reportedly are spontaneously healing, and
the patient is not immunocompromised. In these cases, the
risks for ML or other complications are low, and observation
is a reasonable approach. However, persons with lesions that
do not subsequently heal should be offered treatment.
3.
Increased ML risk: The infection is caused by a Viannia
species from Costa Rica or further south or the species is not
known but infection was acquired in a region where ML is en-
demic. Treatment should be offered even if the lesions are spon-
taneously or recently healed.
The natural history of CL has received limited study, al-
though the placebo groups of clinical trials provide some infor-
mation.
There
is
a variable
tendency
for
lesions to
spontaneously heal within approximately 2–6 months (eg,
L. major), 3–9 months (eg, L. mexicana), or 6–15 months (eg,
L. tropica, L. [V.] braziliensis, or L. [V.] panamensis) of disease
onset [116]. On the basis of this knowledge, observation alone
may be considered for lesions expected to heal in a short time
(eg, 1–3 months) and that are clinically simple as defined in
Table 1. Observation may also be preferred when therapy, espe-
cially systemic therapy, would ideally be delayed, such as during
pregnancy (see XXVI) or during treatment for other conditions
that may interfere or interact with the antileishmanial agents.
Anecdotally, observation is poorly accepted by many persons
as a management approach. Unfortunately, there are no reliable
clinical predictors of delayed healing or therapeutic failure,
other than the demonstration that both phenomena are com-
plex and are related to variability in the host immune response
as well as strain factors [117, 118]. Some factors associated with
slower healing are discussed in clinical question XV. Whether
lesions have healed spontaneously or after treatment, risk for
therapeutic failure remains and it is difficult to quantify for
an individual immunocompetent person.
The primary concern related to observation of CL without
treatment is that, despite apparent spontaneous healing, meta-
static infection in the form of mucosal involvement may occur.
Mucosal disease may cause destructive lesions that are difficult
to treat and may lead to severe sequelae (see II). A careful naso-
oropharyngeal examination should always be performed (see
III). An additional concern is that apparently healing cutaneous
disease may persist for long periods or relapse. Treatment can
mitigate both of these potential complications [116].
The risks for ML in leishmaniasis-endemic areas have been
summarized [119]. Leishmania (V.) braziliensis is the New
World species most often associated with ML, which can
occur years, even decades, after acquisition of infection. The in-
cidence of mucosal involvement associated with CL seems to
vary with geography and species/strain. Generally, it is highest
in the Amazonian basin and adjacent lower altitudes of Andean
South America, particularly Bolivia, Peru, and Brazil, and lower
in Colombia, Venezuela, Argentina, and Central America. Sys-
temic treatment should be offered for L. (V.) braziliensis infec-
tions and other cases in category 3, above. The ML risk is lower
outside of South America and the Central American countries
from Costa Rica southward. Importantly, case reports of disease
imported into North America and Europe by travelers have sug-
gested limited imported mucosal disease from outside these re-
gions [120–132]. NWCL caused by non-Viannia species and
OWCL are very rarely associated with ML, although cases
have been reported in immunocompromised and some immun-
competent hosts [133–135]. Patient education regarding this
possibility should be a standard component of care. The evi-
dence for the effectiveness of systemic treatment in preventing
ML is summarized in clinical question XII.
Another point of consideration in selecting a treatment plan
includes that, although often considered a clinically less virulent
pathogen, L. mexicana has rarely been associated with a more
severe condition known as diffuse cutaneous leishmaniasis
(DCL) [134].DCL has been reported as caused by other species,
including L. amazonensis, L. venezuelensis, and L. pifanoi [42,
e232 • CID 2016:63 (15 December) • Aronson et al
Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/cid/article-abstract/63/12/e202/2645609 by guest on 03 June 2019
 136–138].This syndrome appears to be a type of anergic, severe,
and chronic nonulcerative, plaque-like form of CL, thought to
be related to a host immunologic defect. Treatment is often un-
satisfactory. Systemic treatment is usually given, but relapse is
typical when treatment is stopped. Miltefosine may yield a bet-
ter initial response rate than antimonials, but some type of
chronic or intermittent therapy may be required [139].
Regardless of whether antileishmanial therapy is adminis-
tered, standard wound care should be applied to ulcerative
skin lesions until they have fully reepithelialized. Although
there are few trials of particular interventions, clinical experi-
ence supports the importance of these common measures.
They include control of secondary infection, gentle debride-
ment of necrotic tissue if present, and moisturizing to promote
tissue regeneration. Daily ulcer cleansing with mild soap and al-
lowing water in the shower to run over the lesions is advised. A
thin layer of a petroleum-based ointment (eg, Aquaphor, petro-
leum jelly, Vaseline) should be applied after bathing; other
moisturizing creams used in leishmaniasis include Aquaphilic
or Eucerin products. Occlusion does not seem to be needed,
but can be used when wound drainage is present.
XI. In a Person With Cutaneous Leishmaniasis, What Could Be the
Consequences of No Treatment or Suboptimal Therapy, and How Should
Persons Who Received No or Suboptimal Therapy Be Monitored?
Recommendations.
29. Potential consequences of inadequate treatment include
poor cosmetic outcome due to scarring or superinfection,
the persistence of a chronic wound(s), and, with some Leish-
mania species, destructive and disfiguring ML. In immuno-
compromised persons, cutaneous, mucosal, and visceral
dissemination may occur (fact, no grade).
30. Persons with CL should be actively monitored by clinical
appearance, including by performing a careful nasal and oro-
pharyngeal examination periodically up to 1 year, or at least 2
years if at increased risk for ML. They should be educated
about the signs and symptoms of relapse and ML and in-
structed to seek medical attention anytime these appear
(strong, low).
31. Symptoms such as chronic nasal stuffiness, epistaxis, or
hoarseness or findings such as septal perforation that occur
anytime in a person with a prior or current diagnosis of CL
or a scar consistent with prior CL should prompt evaluation
for ML, including fiber-optic examination of the affected area
if relevant (see II and III) (strong, moderate).
Evidence Summary
When considering whether to treat CL in persons who have not
been previously treated or who have received suboptimal treat-
ment, the potential consequences of the infection should be
considered. The most common morbidity relates to scarring
of the lesions, which can be extensive. Scars and pigmentary
changes, especially if on the face, can have substantial aesthetic
consequences. Scars that are over joints, such as those in the fin-
gers, can impair function. In the short term, optimal treatment
accelerates healing and may reduce tissue destruction. Faster
healing presumably also reduces the opportunity for bacterial
superinfection and the associated complications. These benefits
have been confirmed by clinical experience, although rigorous
assessments of benefits are lacking. In the midterm, treatment
reduces the likelihood of persisting lesions or relapse, whether
local, regional (eg, lymphatic spread), or more distant. In the
long term, although the evidence is indirect, the probability of
developing ML appears to be reduced, and there may be a
reduction
in late
reactivation (eg,
in the
context
of
immunosuppression).
Regardless of whether treatment is administered, careful ob-
jective documentation of the evolution of the skin lesions is im-
portant for guiding clinical management. Photographic records
of lesions are often helpful; even photographs taken by patients
using their own cameras or smartphones can be helpful. Obser-
vations should be made approximately every 2–4 weeks until le-
sions have reepithelialized and less frequently thereafter. The
surface area and induration should be recorded, as well as the
proportion of the ulcer base that has reepithelialized. The le-
sion(s) size, location, and associated subcutaneous nodules or
adenopathy should be noted, especially new findings around
the original lesions and along lymphatic drainage pathways. Ev-
idence of secondary infection of any lesion and adjacent tissues
should be described, including pain, purulence, and fluctuance.
Superinfection may require debridement of eschar. The time
course of healing is further discussed in XV. Careful examina-
tion of the mouth and nose should be included in all follow-up
evaluations (see III); the indications for referral to a specialist
for a complete otorhinolaryngologic examination are discussed
in clinical question III. The likelihood of therapeutic success
and failure has proven very difficult to predict in the individual
patient. Healing rates appear to be influenced by host genetics
and immune responses, the Leishmania strain, and even the
strain of the vector sand fly [116].There are few long-term stud-
ies monitoring defined cohorts of infected patients for thera-
peutic failure. Reappearance of lesions at the same site is
generally presumed to represent relapse. Clinically manifest re-
infection is rare with L. major and has not been well studied for
other species. The extent to which infection with one species/
strain protects against infection (or disease) with another is
also poorly understood [140].
Most relapses of cutaneous lesions occur within 1 year, al-
though much longer intervals have been reported with extended
follow-up periods [141, 142]; viable parasites have been isolated
from healed scars years later [143]. There are many case reports
of later recurrence associated with acquired immunosuppres-
sion [118].
Similar to CL recurrence, the risk for ML following NWCL is
highest within 2 years of the onset of the initial skin lesion (see
Diagnosis and Treatment of Leishmaniasis • CID 2016:63 (15 December) • e233

 III) [22].Persons should be informed that even after routine fol-
low-up has ended, they may still be at risk of developing ML.
Severe sequelae from ML include destructive lesions causing
nasal, oral, pharyngeal, and airway complications; treatment
of advanced ML is often difficult and unsatisfactory (see
XVII). When planning patient follow-up, it can be challenging
to balance the relatively low risk for late ML against the costs
and discomfort of long-term surveillance for ML symptoms
and signs. The risks associated with laryngoscopy and biopsy
are minimal but should nonetheless be considered when dis-
cussing such surveillance [144]. Patient values and preferences
are important when developing follow-up plans.
XII. In a Person With Cutaneous Leishmaniasis, What Factors Should
Prompt Consideration of Use of a Systemic (Oral or Parenteral) Agent for
Initial Therapy?
Recommendations.
32. Systemic treatment is recommended for persons with com-
plex CL as defined in Table 1 (strong, moderate).
33. Initial systemic therapy (see XIII) may be used in persons
with CL in whom it is not practical to use local therapy or
(possibly) if more rapid healing of large, cosmetically or
functionally concerning lesions is preferred (weak, very low).
34. Less common cutaneous syndromes, such as leishmaniasis
recidivans (caused by L. tropica and occasionally other spe-
cies), diffuse cutaneous leishmaniasis (caused by L. mexica-
na, L. amazonensis, and L. aethiopica), and disseminated
cutaneous leishmaniasis (caused by L. [V.] braziliensis), usu-
ally require systemic therapy (strong, low).
Evidence Summary
The most important reason for giving systemic therapy is the
treatment of local or distant dissemination. Systemic (vs
local) therapy involves the reliable and sustained delivery of
the therapeutic agent to the infected tissues, including distant
sites of potential spread. For this reason, systemic therapy has
become the standard of care for all disseminated infection,
and such cases are generally excluded from studies of local ther-
apy. This principle also relates to prevention of ML, presumably
by treating organisms that already have seeded the naso-oro-
pharynx and, perhaps, by accelerating healing and thereby re-
ducing the opportunity for metastatic spread.
Other infections defined as complex (Table 1) may also ben-
efit from systemic therapy. These include large, multiple, or dif-
ficult-to-access lesions that make local treatment (see XIV)
technically difficult or impossible. Data from comparative stud-
ies regarding simple (Table 1) leishmaniasis do not suggest that
systemic therapy is superior to local therapy for uncomplicated
infection (see XIV). Some experts think that systemic therapy
may lead to more rapid healing of lesions compared with
local treatment, with possible associated benefits in terms of
scarring and superinfection, although we did not identify pub-
lished data to support this impression.
Systemic treatment options include parenteral and oral ther-
apies (Table 3). Choosing the optimal therapy for a particular
case is difficult, given the limited information available from
comparative clinical trials and the substantial methodologic or
other limitations of many studies. The majority of treated CL
persons in South America are treated with parenteral pentava-
lent antimonials (SbV). In several recent clinical trials, miltefo-
sine and parenteral SbV therapy were compared, yielding results
that supported FDA approval of miltefosine for this indication.
There are limited published data regarding other systemic
agents, such as amphotericin B deoxycholate, L-AmB, and the
oral azoles. Data from published clinical trials are summarized
in Supplementary Appendix 1. It remains unclear how the re-
sults of individual studies can be extrapolated to other species,
geographic areas, and patient populations where data are
unavailable.
Systemic therapy of NWCL (compared with no or subopti-
mal therapy) appears to reduce the risk for subsequent ML. If
ML is considered to be a risk, treatment selection should be
based on predicted efficacy, patient tolerance of risk for thera-
peutic failure, toxicity, practicality, availability, and cost (see
XIII). ML can cause disfigurement and disabilities, especially
if the diagnosis and treatment are delayed.
No controlled clinical trials have compared the incidence of
ML after treatment of NWCL with systemic vs local therapy (see
XIV). Observational studies have generally found incidence
rates of ML following CL caused by L. (V.) braziliensis to be
2%–10% [119] and close to 30% in some reports [145]. On
the basis of retrospective estimates in an actively surveyed pop-
ulation of >3000 CL persons in an L. (V.) braziliensis focus in
Peru, the lifetime risk for ML was 12.8% [146]. Unfortunately,
study methods have been highly variable and often poorly de-
scribed. It is difficult to use individual studies to assess varia-
tions in risk associated with different geographic regions,
Leishmania species/strains, and host factors; of note, the pro-
portion of patients treated and the types of treatment used in
the study population have not always been described, further
complicating interpretation of the findings.
The evidence that systemic therapy (compared with no or
suboptimal therapy) may reduce the risk of developing ML de-
rives from 3 types of studies: (1) treatment trials of NWCL (pre-
sumed or proven L. [V.] braziliensis) with long-term follow-up
showing rates of ML that appear to be substantially lower than
those described above; (2) case series that suggest that most of
the persons with ML had not received adequate treatment for
their prior CL; and (3) clinical trials of NWCL in which subjects
were observed over extended periods, such that the incidence of
ML could be compared between treated subjects and those who
received incomplete, ineffective, or no therapy.
There have been several studies of the first type. Among 658
persons with presumed L. (V.) braziliensis CL in Brazil (Rio de
Janeiro State), only 0.4% of patients who received various
e234 • CID 2016:63 (15 December) • Aronson et al

 dosage regimens of parenteral SbV treatment went on to develop
ML after follow-up for 1–11 years [147]. In a study in which a
low-dose regimen of parenteral SbV was used and the follow-up
period was 5–10 years, no cases of ML were identified among
120 patients whose cases of CL were successfully treated; and
no cases of ML were reported among 59 patients treated with
intralesional SbV [147, 148]. In a study in Brazil, a 3.2% rate
(2/62 persons) of development of ML posttreatment was report-
ed [142].
The second type of study suggests that the majority of cases of
ML occur in persons who did not receive optimal therapy for
their prior cutaneous lesions. This type of study includes a series
of 78 Brazilian patients with ML, only 7 of whom reported hav-
ing a history of treatment of CL [27],and a series of 12 Brazilian
patients, 4 of whom had been treated previously (3 with paren-
teral SbV and 1 with pentamidine) [149]. However, among im-
ported ML cases in travelers, there are reports of some who had
received prior systemic treatment [132].
There have been a few small studies of the third type. In a
study in Colombia (L. [V.] panamensis and L. [V.] braziliensis),
none of 66 subjects with CL treated with parenteral SbV, 2 of 55
treated with allopurinol (generally not effective for CL), and 1
of 46 who received placebo developed ML within 1 year [150].
In a study in Salvador, Brazil, 2 of 18 patients treated with allo-
purinol developed ML within 1 year, compared with none of 16
who received parenteral SbV [151].
In aggregate, these observations suggest that effective system-
ic treatment of NWCL caused by Viannia species can decrease
the risk for ML but may not prevent all cases of ML.
XIII. What Systemic Treatment Options Are Available in North America
for Cutaneous Leishmaniasis, and What Factors Should Be Considered
When Selecting a Medication for an Individual Patient?
Recommendations.
35. The parenteral options for systemic therapy currently avail-
able in North America include conventional amphotericin B
deoxycholate, lipid formulations of amphotericin B, pentava-
lent antimonial (SbV) compounds, and pentamidine (listed
in alphabetical order). Oral options include miltefosine and
the “azole” antifungal compounds, including ketoconazole
(if potential benefits outweigh risks for hepatotoxicity and
QT prolongation) and fluconazole (fact, no grade).
36. To maximize effectiveness and to minimize toxicity, the
choice of agent, dose, and duration of therapy should be indi-
vidualized (strong, moderate). Comments: No ideal or univer-
sally applicable therapy for CL has been identified. Some
therapies/regimens appear highly effective only against certain
Leishmania species/strains in certain areas of the world. Both
the parasite species and host factors (eg, comorbid conditions
and immunologic status) should be considered.
37. Factors that should be considered when selecting CL treat-
ment for an individual patient include the risk for ML; the
Leishmania strain/species and published response rates for
antileishmanial agents in the pertinent geographic region;
the potential for adverse events; age extremes; childbearing
competence and pregnancy; obesity; hepatic, pancreatic,
renal, and cardiac comorbid conditions; preference for and
convenience of various routes of administration; the rapidity
with which one wishes to control the infection; the impact of
lesions on daily activities and patient self-confidence; the pa-
tient/provider comfort level with logistics (eg, Investigational
New Drug protocols); and other practical issues (eg, drug
availability, various types of cost, insurance reimbursement)
(see XII and XXVI; Tables 3 and 4) (strong, low).
Evidence Summary
The options for systemic treatment of CL in North America are
partially limited by availability issues (Table 3), which are dis-
cussed for each individual agent below. In the United States,
using those drugs that are available only under Investigational
New Drug (IND) protocols implies somewhat reduced flexibil-
ity in treatment administration and the need for IND-associated
record keeping and review. In Canada, agents not approved for
use are available through the Special Access Program from
Health Canada; but physicians must make their own arrange-
ments for importation, and permission is usually given only if
other approved agents can be clearly shown to be ineffective, in-
ferior, or not tolerated. Associated costs may not be covered by
public or private insurance.
There is no ideal systemic treatment, in the sense of being
uniformly and highly effective, regardless of the parasite species
or the patient’s immunologic status; safe, regardless of the pa-
tient’s age, pregnancy status, or comorbidities; and inexpensive,
short-course oral therapy. Each available regimen lacks several
of these desirable features. Individual persons and physicians
will weigh these factors differently. No therapy has been
shown to eradicate all parasites, and the risk for relapse cannot
be entirely eliminated.
The choice of systemic agents will depend on several factors.
Species-directed therapy has received much attention. The rel-
evant data have been reviewed [85], and most available clinical
trials are summarized in the Supplementary Appendix. In gene-
ral, the mainstay for systemic treatment has been the pentava-
lent antimonials (SbV); the majority of the data on treatment
relates to the use of these agents, and these agents have been
the reference against which other agents have been compared.
The antimonials have issues with toxicity and availability,
which provide the motivation for using alternative regimens
and agents.
The reasons for choosing systemic therapy are discussed in
clinical question XII. Modification of the risk for ML is often
an important consideration, but the only available data involve
use of SbV; other agents may be considered when the risk for
ML is thought to be low or if geographically restricted

 therapeutic failure with SbV has been reported. It is difficult to
accurately determine whether an infection is truly localized or
who is at risk for dissemination. When systemic treatment is
chosen for cosmetic or practical reasons, factors related to tox-
icity, cost, and convenience become more relevant.
Factors in addition to the Leishmania species and the geo-
graphic region in which the infection was acquired may nega-
tively affect response rates and may account for some of the
heterogeneity in the results of clinical trials. Factors that may
adversely affect outcome include markers of severity, such as
higher number of skin lesions and coinfection with Leishmania
RNA virus 1 [152,153].Factors that, paradoxically, may increase
the risk for poor outcome include shorter duration of exposure
in a CL-endemic region (<72 months), earlier initiation of ther-
apy for CL, and younger patient age [153]. Treatment early in
the course of the disease, including treatment of adenitis before
skin ulceration is evident, appears to be a risk factor for poor
response [154]. One hypothesis is that some or all of these fac-
tors may be proxies for a less-effective immune response [155].
Therapeutic failure with particular antileishmanial agents has
not been well studied in CL. Unusually high antimonial thera-
peutic failure rates have been noted in tourists returning from
Amazonian Bolivia, generally L. (V.) braziliensis acquired in
the frequently visited Madidi National Park [156]. Anecdotally,
this observation has also been associated with L. (V.) braziliensis
acquired in Manu National Park and Puerto Maldonado in
southeastern Peru. Miltefosine appeared to perform less well
against L. (V.) braziliensis in Guatemala compared with other
countries [157]. Research techniques for monitoring drug resis-
tance in vitro have been described; surveillance of response rates
in specific regions, together with monitoring of clinical risk fac-
tors associated with treatment success or failure, may become
available in the future.
It is possible that some therapeutic failures are related to our
limited understanding of drug pharmacodynamics and weight-
based dosing. On the basis of pharmacokinetic considerations,
we assume that amphotericin B deoxycholate doses should be
based on total body weight, whereas pentavalent antimonial
dosing is more complex and, in some cases, might be better
guided by ideal body weight (see XXVI). Anecdotal experience
with miltefosine suggests that gastrointestinal toxicity tends to
limit the ability to give daily doses >150 mg. As mentioned
above, drug toxicities as listed in Table 4 become more impor-
tant considerations among those with relevant comorbidities
and in the elderly in general. Some antileishmanial drugs are
not recommended during pregnancy or breastfeeding (see
XXVI and Table 4).
Convenience and adherence are important in some cases. For
example, amphotericin compounds are typically given with sa-
line loading and premedication, and the entire process may take
4 hours for each dose. Antimonials can be infused over a shorter
time but may require more doses. Use of oral agents presumes
adherence, in contrast to parenteral doses administered by a
health worker. In some settings, services for giving intravenous
(IV) infusions may not be available on weekends, and some
home care services will not administer IND agents.
The systemic antileishmanial agents available in North
America are discussed below and in Tables 3 and 4.
SbV compounds have been the mainstay of systemic antileish-
manial treatment for approximately 7 decades. They have
shown reasonably good efficacy against almost all Leishmania
species in most geographic regions. However, no SbV drug is ap-
proved for commercial use in the United States or Canada. In
the United States, the SbV compound sodium stibogluconate
(SSG; Pentostam, GlaxoSmithKline; 100 mg SbV/mL) is avail-
able to US-licensed physicians under IND protocols—for civil-
ians, through the CDC Drug Service; and, for military
beneficiaries, through the US Army Medical Materiel Develop-
ment Activity. At the time of this writing, the IND protocols
cover IV and intramuscular (IM) but not intralesional adminis-
tration. In North America, the most common route of admin-
istration is IV (vs IM), in part because the volume per dose is
high (eg, 14 mL for a 70-kg patient treated with SSG). The tra-
ditional regimen for CL is 20 mg of SbV per kg daily for 20 days;
10 days may suffice in some settings. In Canada, both meglu-
mine antimoniate (Glucantime, Sanofi; 81 mg SbV/mL) and
SSG are available to licensed physicians through the Special Ac-
cess Program from Health Canada, generally free of charge
(Tables 3 and 4).
The oral agent miltefosine was approved by the FDA in
March 2014 for use in the United States for treatment of CL
caused by 3 particular species, L. (V.) braziliensis, L. (V.) pana-
mensis, and L. (V.) guyanensis, in persons ≥12 years of age who
weigh ≥30 kg (see XXVI). However, the effectiveness of milte-
fosine even for infection caused by these species has been var-
iable in clinical trials—most notably, the cure rates for L. (V.)
braziliensis infection 6 months posttreatment have ranged
from 33% (5 of 15 persons) in Guatemala to 80% (32 of 40 per-
sons) in Bolivia [157]. The FDA-approved regimen of miltefo-
sine is 2.5 mg/kg/day (maximum, 150 mg, in 3 divided doses)
for 28 days. The upper limit of 150 mg/day was established be-
cause of poor gastrointestinal tolerability and applies to all per-
sons who weigh ≥45 kg. Limited information is available about
the use of miltefosine in heavier persons, particularly in those
who weigh ≥75 kg (see XXVI). However, some data suggest
that doses <2 mg/kg per day are associated with lower response
rates [158]. Miltefosine is not approved for use in Canada, and
permission to import the drug is not always granted.
Conventional amphotericin B deoxycholate traditionally has
been used as rescue therapy for CL. Some data suggest that am-
photericin B is likely to be highly and broadly effective against a
wide range of species. Lipid formulations of amphotericin B
generally are better tolerated than conventional amphotericin
B and may be better tolerated than SbV (especially in
e236 • CID 2016:63 (15 December) • Aronson et al
Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/cid/article-abstract/63/12/e202/2645609 by guest on 03 June 2019
 HIV-coinfected persons). Essentially no controlled clinical tri-
als of amphotericin B formulations have been successfully com-
pleted for CL; standard dosage regimens have not been
established. The anecdotal experience using lipid formulations
of amphotericin B, which are targeted to the reticuloendothelial
system, has been mixed. Reasonably good response rates in the
range of approximately 83%–85% have been reported for IV L-
AmB in several case series: for Bolivian L. (V.) braziliensis CL in
34 Israeli tourists who were treated with a total L-AmB dose of
18 mg/kg (6 doses of 3 mg/kg/day); for L. tropica CL in 13 Is-
raeli patients who also were treated with a total of 18 mg/kg; and
for CL caused by various Old World and New World species
among 19 US military healthcare beneficiaries whose initial
L-AmB course (for purposes of the efficacy analyses) entailed
a median total dose of 21 mg/kg (maximum of 30 mg/kg)
[156, 159, 160]. Despite the lack of randomized controlled clin-
ical data, off-label use of L-AmB is appealing to some clinicians
because the drug is readily available in North America and they
may be familiar with its use.
Pentamidine has had a unique niche in the treatment of
L. (V.) guyanensis infection, largely on the basis of studies of in-
dividuals with high response rates, although most are retrospec-
tive observations. A single randomized controlled trial showed
outcomes similar to parenteral antimony [161].Two clinical tri-
als have been conducted for L. (V.) braziliensis infection; the
first showed inferiority to antimony, and the second showed
outcomes similar to antimony [162, 163]. A more recent
study from Suriname showed a lower therapeutic success rate
than in previous studies, leading to the question of whether re-
sistance to pentamidine could be emerging; however, this study
was of low quality due to a high rate of loss to follow-up [164].
Pentamidine showed some efficacy in treatment of L. (V.) pan-
amensis infection in Colombia [165,166].Pentamidine, which is
available as an isethionate salt, has been used in doses lower
than those used to treat Pneumocystis pneumonia (its most
common indication in North America) and, consequently,
with less associated toxicity (Table 4).
The azoles ketoconazole and fluconazole have been used with
mixed results, in various settings. For example: ketoconazole
(adult regimen: 600 mg daily for 28 days) showed modest activ-
ity against L. mexicana and L. (V.) panamensis infection in
small studies in Guatemala and Panama, respectively [167,
168]. Use of fluconazole (adult regimen: 200 mg daily for 6
weeks) for treatment of L. major infection in various countries
in the Old World has been associated with mixed results [169,
170].Preliminary data from Iran suggest that a higher daily dose
(400 vs 200 mg) for 6 weeks might be more effective against
L. major infection [171]. Preliminary, uncontrolled data from
northeastern Brazil suggest that a regimen of 8 mg/kg daily
for 4–6 weeks might be effective against L. (V.) braziliensis in-
fection in that region, at least in the short term [172]. There is
little evidence for the efficacy of itraconazole, essentially no
clinical data are available for posaconazole or voriconazole,
and data comparing the azole agents with each other are not
available. Thus, whereas ketoconazole is relatively toxic
(Table 4), it is unknown whether other agents in this class
have similar antileishmanial efficacy. Additionally, although
substantial toxicity issues with ketoconazole have been de-
scribed, such as serious hepatotoxicity in persons without ap-
parent risk factors and QT prolongation that can result in
life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias, these risks should be
weighed against the toxicity of other commonly used antileish-
manial agents, such as amphotericin and antimonial drugs.
Comparative and some recent selected noncomparative clin-
ical trials of various available therapies are summarized in the
Supplementary Appendix, together with a general assessment
of the methodology and conduct of each study. Studies are clas-
sified according to species and geographic region. The reader
can use the Supplementary Appendix to extract the studies rel-
evant to a particular species and region of acquisition, and to
obtain information about the quality of the treatment data.
The marked heterogeneity among the studies suggests that
data from one species/region cannot be extrapolated to other
species or regions.
XIV. In Which Clinical Settings Can Local Therapy Be Used Effectively
in a Person With Cutanous Leishmaniasis?
Recommendations.
38. Local therapy is preferred for treatment of OWCL lesions
defined as clinically simple (Table 1) and may be useful for
localized NWCL caused by Leishmania species not associat-
ed with increased risk for ML (strong, moderate). Comment:
Local therapy includes heat and cryotherapy, topical oint-
ments/creams with paromomycin and other ingredients, in-
tralesional injections of pentavalent antimonial drugs (with
or without cryotherapy), and photodynamic or laser
treatment.
39. Eschar(s) overlying ulcers should be debrided before ad-
ministration of local therapy and any secondary infection
managed to maximize treatment effect (strong, very low).
Evidence Summary
The overarching concept is that localized and limited CL (sim-
ple CL) should, in general, be treated initially with local thera-
pies, which typically can suffice for healing, and are less toxic
and less expensive than systemic therapies. See Table 1 for a def-
inition of complex CL, which usually is not treated solely with
local therapy. A current constraint in North America is access to
and experience with local therapies, which are more in the prac-
tice scope of dermatologists than infectious disease clinicians.
Types of local therapy include physical treatments (eg, heat,
liquid nitrogen, photodynamic therapy, CO2 laser), intralesion-
al injection (pentavalent antimony), and topical ointments/
creams (paromomycin preparations). Most of the published

 experience using local therapies has been with OWCL, particu-
larly in L. major/L. tropica-endemic regions, with limited pub-
lished experience with CL caused by L. infantum or
L. aethiopica. In the New World, local therapies have been re-
ported in few studies; species represented include L. infantum-
chagasi, L. mexicana, L. amazonensis, L. (V.) braziliensis, L. (V.)
guyanensis, and L. (V.) naiffi.
Patients for whom local therapy may be a good option in-
clude those who have small, few lesions of localized CL that
do not involve the nose, ears, eyelids, lips, or genitalia; patients
who are pregnant for whom systemic therapy may be contrain-
dicated because of potential toxicity; and patients who may ben-
efit from mop-up treatment after an incomplete response to
systemic therapy. Combination therapy (eg, local therapy plus
an azole or cryotherapy plus intralesional SbV) may be consid-
ered for some patients. Therapeutic failure of initial local treat-
ment can be managed with oral or parenteral systemic therapy.
Local therapy usually is not recommended for treatment of CL
if the risk for mucosal dissemination is considered substantial.
This includes infection acquired south of Nicaragua with spe-
cies in the Viannia subgenus. Local therapy is also not usually
recommended for treatment of CL lesions with associated nod-
ular lymphangitis or in immunocompromised hosts (Table 1).
Before initiating local therapy, lesions with overlying eschar
should be debrided down to a clean ulcer base; secondary bac-
terial infection (eg, manifest by suppuration or surrounding cel-
lulitis), if present, should be treated.
Physical Methods for CL Treatment.
Heat treatment: Der-
matotropic species, such as L. major, L. tropica, and L. mexica-
na, are thermosensitive [173]. The therapeutic effect of heat
generated in tissue using radiofrequency waves has been studied
in randomized controlled trials with efficacy rates ranging from
54% to 81% (see Supplementary Appendix) [174–179]. Efficacy
rates with 2 devices have been reported: the Ellman RF device
(Ellman International, Inc, Hicksville New York) and, more
commonly, with the ThermoMed device (Thermosurgery Tech-
nologies Inc, Phoenix, Arizona), which is FDA cleared for treat-
ment of CL. In brief, the protocol is to initially disinfect the
lesion and surrounding skin (such as with an iodine prepara-
tion), provide local anesthesia with lidocaine, moisten with ster-
ile saline, and apply the heat at 50°C for 30-second doses using
the device prongs to cover the lesion in a grid-like pattern ex-
tending 1–2 mm into surrounding normal-appearing skin. A
second-degree burn can be anticipated.
The cosmetic outcome with heat therapy generally has been
good, although with repeated treatment sessions more scarring
may be seen. Most recipients report mild pain afterward for a
day, redness, oozing, and an eventual crusted eschar. Secondary
bacterial infection can occur; use of topical antibiotics and dres-
sing(s) for several days after a heat treatment is recommended.
Good candidates for heat therapy include persons with uncom-
plicated CL, with smaller (≤25 mm width) and fewer lesions,
not directly over superficial veins, nerves, or cartilaginous tissue.
Areas where scarring is an issue, such as eyelids, nose, and the
lips, should be avoided. Heat therapy can be used during preg-
nancy/breastfeeding and may also have a role as follow-up man-
agement for residual lesions not healing after systemic
treatment.
Cryotherapy (or cryosurgery) may be more readily available
than heat therapy. Various regimens of cryotherapy have been
published. An example of an approach is to apply liquid nitro-
gen with a cotton-tipped applicator for 15–20 seconds, until 1–
2 mm of the circumferential skin around the lesion appears fro-
zen; then thaw for 20–60 seconds; then repeat the freeze step;
and repeat the entire process at 3-week intervals until healing
occurs [180]. In some studies, more frequent applications
were administered. No anesthesia is used, which reportedly is
not helpful.
Combination therapy with cryotherapy, immediately fol-
lowed by intralesional antimony, seems to have the best efficacy.
In 2 controlled clinical trials in Iran, persons with CL were ran-
domized to receive intralesional (IL) SbV, cryotherapy, or a
combination of both therapies, which were administered every
1–2 weeks for 6–8 weeks [181, 182]. In these studies, the thera-
peutic success rates for the combined treatment arms were
higher (89% and 91%). The most responsive lesions tended to
be those that were small (<30 mm width), on the face or neck,
dry, and present for <3 months. When cryotherapy is combined
with IL SbV, a shorter application of liquid nitrogen is used (eg,
no second freeze step), and the whitened skin is allowed to nor-
malize in color before injection of the SbV a few seconds later. On
the basis of limited data, cryotherapy has also been effective for
infection caused by L. aethiopica in Ethiopia, L. donovani in Sri
Lanka, and L. infantum in the Mediterranean region [182, 183].
Data from several large (thousands of persons), noncompar-
ative case series provide perspective about the toxicity that can
be associated with cryotherapy. Immediate reactions that can be
seen in and near the treated skin include vesicle formation, er-
ythema, swelling, and burning pain. Both hypo- and hyperpig-
mentation result; they typically are worse and more persistent in
patients with darkly pigmented skin but generally have im-
proved by 6–12 months of follow-up. Overall in the series, the
scar has been described as acceptable, although keloids may
form [184–186]. Cryotherapy should be considered in smaller,
recent-onset, uncomplicated CL lesions, including nonulcera-
tive forms. It has been well tolerated on the face, but avoidance
of eyelids, lips, nose, and ears is recommended. It can be used
during pregnancy and breastfeeding. It also may be an option
for treatment of small residual lesions that persist after systemic
therapy.
The success of both heat and cryotherapy is highly dependent
on the skill of the operator and complete, careful application. It
is important to treat into normal-appearing tissue around the
lesions. Persons who have evidence of potential dissemination

 (eg, subcutaneous nodules or regional adenopathy) and are in-
fected with NWCL Leishmania species that can cause ML
should not be treated solely with physical methods, which
may not control the infection. Experience in OWCL suggests
that small subcutaneous nodules may respond to local therapy
of the primary lesion alone [187].
Other Treatments.
Photodynamic therapy and carbon di-
oxide laser treatment have been studied in randomized clinical
trials with some promising early results [188–190].
Intralesional Pentavalent Antimonial Treatment.
The
SbV compounds sodium stibogluconate and meglumine anti-
moniate have been used for intralesional treatment of CL (see
above, the Supplementary Appendix, and Table 3). Most of
the published clinical trials have involved OWCL, although re-
cently a few studies of NWCL have been performed. The intra-
lesional method uses the undiluted parenteral formulation of
these drugs but at much smaller doses (see below), which results
in fewer systemic adverse effects and less expense. Laboratory
monitoring is not needed. The procedure is painful; local anes-
thesia should be given in advance (such as with EMLA cream,
ie, lidocaine plus prilocaine), and young children may need ge-
neral anesthesia. Intralesional SbV injections should not be used
on fingers, nose, ears, eyelids, near the lips, or anywhere vascu-
lar compromise could be of concern. In addition to pain, ad-
verse effects can include local allergic reactions, pruritus,
edema, and transient erythema.
In general, referral of patients to practitioners who have expe-
rience with intralesional administration is suggested when this
treatment approach is considered. The aim is to inject the SbV
into the dermis, using a small-gauge needle (25–27G); subcuta-
neous injection would be innocuous but ineffective. The volume
injected is determined as a function of lesion size and varies
from 0.2 to 5 mL in up to 4–5 injection sites, with a total esti-
mated dose of about 0.1 mL/cm2. The WHO recommends re-
peating injections every 3–7 days until healing occurs [42].
First cleanse the lesion and surrounding skin (eg, with Betadine
or soap and water), then approach the lesion with the needle at a
right angle initially and infiltrate in a V-shaped pattern, inject-
ing drug under pressure as the needle is advanced [191]. Initial-
ly, the dermal injection may be met with resistance; this tends to
decrease with subsequent sessions. The entire lesion and 1–2
mm of surrounding normal-appearing skin must be infiltrated
until blanching is seen. When combination therapy with cryo-
therapy is used, the SbV should be injected after liquid nitrogen
(no preanesthesia is used) until blanching of lesion borders and
swelling of the entire base are noted. As with the physical meth-
ods, the skill of the operator and careful controlled application
are key to a successful outcome.
Most of the clinical trials of intralesional SbV therapy have
been conducted in the Old World, in Iran/Afghanistan, in stud-
ies in which the infecting species was not identified but the pos-
sibilities (depending on the region) included primarily L. major
and L. tropica. Many regimens have been used, ranging from
one injection 2–3 times per week to one injection every other
week for 5–8 weeks; response rates have ranged from 25% to
100% [175, 192–195]. Only a few studies of intralesional SbV
therapy for NWCL have been reported, generally because the
risk for metastatic infection associated with L. (V.) braziliensis
and other Viannia species has dissuaded use of local therapy. In
a randomized clinical trial of single-ulcer (≤30 mm largest di-
ameter) Bolivian CL (predominantly L. [V.] braziliensis), intra-
lesional SbV dosed on days 1, 3, and 5 was compared with 2
doses of cryotherapy and with placebo cream. The reported ef-
ficacies of treatments at 3 months (with only 6 months of fol-
low-up) were 70%, 20%, and 17% [196]. As per the prior
cryotherapy section, studies combining cryotherapy with intra-
lesional antimony showed an improved response in OWCL
compared with each method individually [181, 197]. This syn-
ergistic response has also been noted for L. infantum, L. mexi-
cana, L. amazonensis, and L. (V.) naiffi infection [85].
Topical Paromomycin Preparations.
The only topical
preparation with good supportive evidence for use in the treat-
ment of CL is topical paromomycin. This aminoglycoside has
been studied primarily in ulcerative infections caused by L.
major in the Old World and by L. (V.) panamensis (small stud-
ies with other NWCL species) in Colombia and Panama [198–
200]. Note that the vehicle seems cardinally important for effi-
cacy, and different formulations cannot be considered equiva-
lent. In a recent meta-analysis [201], the response to topical
paromomycin therapy was higher if the formulation included
methylbenzethonium chloride (MBCL), which itself induces a
local inflammatory response. For L. major infection, the efficacy
was equivalent to that for intralesional SbV; in NWCL, it was
inferior to parenteral SbV therapy. Topical agents may have bet-
ter absorption in ulcerative (vs nodular) skin lesions, which may
partially explain why the reported efficacy for L. tropica and L.
aethiopica infection has been poor; L. tropica seems inherently
less responsive (39% cure rate) than L. major to paromomycin/
MBCL [202]. More recently, a third-generation topical paromo-
mycin and gentamicin cream WR 279,396 (without MBCL) has
been found in several phase 2 studies and a phase 3 clinical trial
(N = 375 patients) to be associated with response rates of 81%–
94% (compared with 58%–71% for vehicle placebo) using a 20-
day course; twice-daily and once-daily applications have been
associated with comparable response rates for treatment of L.
major infection [203, 204].
None of these preparations are commercially available or
FDA approved in the United States. WR279,396 is available
under an expanded-access treatment protocol for US military
healthcare beneficiaries (for details, contact: usarmy.detrick.

XV. What Are the Recommended Timeframes and Findings to Assess
Response to Treatment in a Person With Cutaneous Leishmaniasis?
Recommendations.
40. Response to treatment is assessed by clinical criteria; repeat
parasitologic testing is not recommended if the skin lesion
appears to be healing (strong, low). Comment: The healing
process may continue after the treatment course is complet-
ed, especially for large ulcerative lesions.
41. Persons with CL should have their skin lesions monitored
for 6–12 months after treatment for clinical evidence of ther-
apeutic failure, which is initially seen at the border of a healed
lesion (strong, low). Comment: The first sign of healing is
usually flattening of the skin lesion. By 4–6 weeks after treat-
ment, the lesion size should have decreased by >50%, ulcer-
ative lesions should be reepithelializing, and no new lesions
should be appearing. Ulcerative lesions are generally fully re-
epithelialized and clinically healed by approximately 3
months after treatment.
Evidence Summary
The responses of individual persons to treatment of CL are as-
sessed clinically by the physical appearance of their lesion(s).
Therapeutic success is usually defined as complete epithelializa-
tion of ulcerative lesions and lack of inflammatory findings/in-
duration for nonulcerative lesions. Scarring is common but can
improve with remodeling over months to years. Parasitologic
assessment is used in the context of clinical trials, but it does
not correlate well with clinical healing, which is the patient-rel-
evant outcome [205–207]. During the first 2 weeks of therapy,
there can be a paradoxical increase in the perilesional inflam-
matory response, including new satellite lesions and more ery-
thema/induration, especially around the border [208]. This
exacerbation does not portend a poor treatment response but
may be concerning to the patient and physician; with adequate
treatment, it will usually resolve within 3–4 weeks.
Treatment response can vary based on many factors. CL
caused by some Leishmania species often spontaneously heals
within months (eg, L. mexicana, L. major), whereas CL caused
by L. tropica and Viannia species may be very slow to resolve.
Other parameters that affect the response to treatment include
host factors (eg, age, immune status); lesion appearance (eg,
ulcerative vs not), location (eg, lesions on the lower legs or on
cartilaginous areas, such as ears or nose, may be slow to heal),
and severity; bacterial superinfection (may interfere with heal-
ing); and the treatment and route of administration used [209].
Clinical trials show that tissue repair will take weeks after the
parasite is killed; therefore, typically, healing is seen by 6–9
weeks after the start of treatment (faster with L. major and
L. mexicana; slower with Viannia species). Especially for large
ulcerative lesions, the healing process may continue after the
treatment course has been completed. Five clinical parameters
of healing have been suggested for assessing endpoints in treat-
ment trials: the size of the area of ulceration (using the 2 largest-
diameter measurements), the size of the area of induration
(consider using the ballpoint pen method to determine), an es-
timate of the thickness of the induration, the color of the lesion
border, and the extent of scarring [209, 210].
A general timeline for assessing the adequacy of the treatment
response was developed by a WHO expert consensus group
[209]. Usually one should expect some degree of improvement
by 42–63 days after the start of treatment and clinical “cure” by
3 months [211]. Patients should be monitored for 6–12 months
to assess for longer-term therapeutic failure or relapse (most
occur within the first 3 months posttreatment). The first sign
of healing is usually flattening (decreasing induration) of the
skin lesion. Other physical findings associated with progressive
healing include increasing reepithelialization of ulcerative lesions,
decreasing lesion size, the presence of more granulation tissue,
and decreasing erythema. In contrast, enlarging lesions or new
lesions (eg, satellite lesions) or subcutaneous nodules along the
draining lymphatics may be indicators of a lack of response.
Therapeutic failure often starts with breakdown along the border
of previously epithelialized ulcers; increasing size, induration, and
erythema are also suggestive of reactivation.
XVI. What Are the Recommended Approaches for Additional
Management in a Person With Cutaneous Leishmaniasis That Does Not
Respond to Therapy?
Recommendations.
42. Additional therapy is recommended (but not necessarily
always with a different agent or approach) when there is de-
velopment of new skin lesions or worsening of existing le-
sions. Additional therapy is also recommended if there is
incomplete healing by 3 months after completion of the
treatment course (strong, low).
43. We recommend that therapeutic failure be assessed by
physical appearance. Relatively little improvement or wors-
ening while on therapy suggests an inadequate response,
and an alternate treatment approach should be planned
(strong, low). Comment: A paradoxical increase in the local
inflammatory response may be seen in the first 2–3 weeks
of treatment and can be difficult to differentiate from thera-
peutic failure.

Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/cid/article-abstract/63/12/e202/2645609 by guest on 03 June 2019
 44. Consultation with a leishmaniasis expert about other
treatment options is recommended for management of per-
sons’ lesions associated with therapeutic failure (strong,
very low).
Evidence Summary
Limited published data are available that can inform clinical
management decisions when CL therapeutic failure occurs.
The factors considered with the initial therapy decision contin-
ue to be important, and the treatment history may influence the
retreatment choices. Drug availability, as well as the experience
of the treating provider and the wishes of the patient, will influ-
ence the approach taken.
When therapeutic failure has occurred, confirmation of the
diagnosis and species identification of the parasite (by culture
and molecular diagnostic testing), if not previously done, are
recommended. When scraping or aspiration of the lesion does
not yield sufficient diagnostic information, obtaining a full-
thickness biopsy specimen should be considered.
Local wound care should be continued and bacterial super-
infection, if any, should be treated as it has been associated
with lower response rates to SbV therapy [212]. Changing
the treatment should be considered, such as selecting a differ-
ent local therapy, a different systemic therapy, or a systemic in-
stead of a local therapy. To mitigate adverse effects, a washout
period between therapies may be required (eg, between SbV
and amphotericin B formulations). Retreatment with more
of the same drug may also work. If CL progresses during ther-
apy or if there is no response at all by 4–6 weeks posttreatment,
retreating with the same drug may not be the best option. For
some patients, combination therapy may be an option—for ex-
ample, with 2 antiparasitic agents, an antiparasitic plus a phys-
ical modality (such as with IL SbV plus cryotherapy), or an
antiparasitic plus an immune modulator. Sometimes, discon-
tinuation of therapy and observation may be the optimal
approach.
Despite relatively high therapeutic failure rates even in
immunocompetent persons (approximately 10%–25%), the
possibility of immune deficiency should be considered if
CL is rapidly progressive, unresponsive to various therapeu-
tic modalities, or highly atypical in clinical manifestations.
If the patient is immunocompromised or if the Leishmania
species/strain is associated with ML, systemic therapy
should be continued either alone or in combination with
another agent/modality unless associated with substantial
toxicity.
Predictors of therapeutic failure include host as well as para-
site factors. The host’s general immunologic status (especially
regarding cell-mediated immunity) plays an important role in
treatment response [213, 214]. Corticosteroids, both topical
and systemic [215–219], have been associated with recurrence
of CL; similarly, immune modulators, especially TNF-α
antagonists (eg, infliximab), have also been implicated in ther-
apeutic failure (see XXV) [220].
Several case-control studies in Peru assessed risk factors asso-
ciated with CL SbV therapeutic failure. Depending on the re-
port, these included concomitant distant lesions, the species
L. (V.) braziliensis, young patient age, short duration of skin le-
sions, prior treatment, incomplete treatment, and body weight
>68 kg [154, 155, 221–223]. Local trauma was also associated
with CL recurrence [5, 219].
In addition to host factors described above, intrinsic and
acquired parasite resistance to antileishmanials has been de-
scribed with SbV [224–233], miltefosine [234], amphotericin
B (deoxycholate or liposomal) [217, 231, 233, 235, 236], and
pentamidine [231] in treatment of Old World and New
World CL. Therapeutic failure has been associated with CL
caused by the following species: L. (V.) braziliensis [228, 234,
237, 238], L. (V.) panamensis [227, 234], L. tropica, L. major
[239], and L. aethiopica [240]. Therapeutic failure with local
physical or other nondrug modalities (eg, cryotherapy, heat
therapy, photodynamic therapy) has been reported [233], but
this cannot strictly be considered parasite resistance or even a
host-driven therapeutic failure. Success or failure with some of
these modalities may also depend, in part, on operator
expertise.
Therapeutic decision making for persons with relapsed CL or
CL treatment failure, including leishmaniasis recidivans, can be
challenging and frustrating. We recommend consultation with a
leishmaniasis treatment expert regarding management options.
The evidence for these recommendations derives from case re-
ports and modest-sized case series. Therapeutic choices are
often driven by the availability of particular treatment modali-
ties and the practitioner’s experience. The published reports
must be interpreted in the context that CL is a self-resolving dis-
ease in immunocompetent hosts, in whom the course and prog-
nosis vary greatly by species/strain, geographic location, and
various host factors.
Summarized below are treatments that have been reported as
successful for CL with therapeutic failure. In NWCL, repeating
a course of antimonials [216]; and treating with immunomod-
ulators, such as imiquimod, pentoxifylline, or granulocyte mac-
rophage colony-stimulating factor, together with repeat courses
of antimonial drugs or alone, have been associated with efficacy
[233, 241, 242]. Amphotericin and L-AmB are regularly used in
lieu of SbV, including in retreatment for therapeutic failure [160,
221].Leishmania (V.) guyanensis infection can be treated with a
repeat course of pentamidine [219]. For therapeutic failure of
OWCL, repeating antimonial therapy IL or systemically, adding
or using imiquimod [220], changing to L-AmB [159], using
combination treatments such as allopurinol and SbV [243], or
extending the duration of/repeating a liposomal amphotericin
course [160] have been reported anecdotally as successful ther-
apeutic strategies.

 RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE TREATMENT OF
MUCOSAL LEISHMANIASIS
XVII. What Are the Treatment Options for American (New World)
Mucosal Leishmaniasis?
Recommendations.
45. All persons with clinically manifest, metastatic, American
ML should receive systemic antileishmanial therapy, with the
goals of preventing morbidity (eg, disfigurement) and mor-
tality (eg, from aspiration pneumonia or respiratory obstruc-
tion) (strong, low).
46. Before treatment is initiated, a complete examination of the
naso-oropharyngeal/laryngeal mucosa should be conducted
by a specialist to assess the anatomic extension and clinical
severity of the mucosal disease, which have prognostic impli-
cations (strong, moderate).
47. We recommend inpatient monitoring and prophylactic
corticosteroid therapy for persons with laryngeal/pharyngeal
disease and increased risk for respiratory obstruction, as in-
dicated by symptoms and otolaryngologic/radiologic exami-
nations, because of the potential for inflammatory reactions
after initiation of antileishmanial therapy (strong, low).
48. The choice of antileishmanial agent, dose, and duration of
therapy for persons with ML should be individualized
(Table 3) (strong, moderate). Comments: The traditional op-
tions for ML include treatment with a pentavalent antimoni-
al (SbV) compound (20 mg SbV/kg daily, IV or IM, for 28–30
days) or with amphotericin B deoxycholate (0.5–1.0 mg/kg
per dose, IV, daily or every other day, for a cumulative
total of approximately 20–45 mg/kg). More recently, on the
basis of comparatively limited data, the armamentarium has
expanded to include lipid formulations of amphotericin B
(typically, L-AmB, with a cumulative total dose ranging
widely from approximately 20 to 60 mg/kg), as well as the
oral agent miltefosine (approximately 2.5 mg/kg per day
[maximum, 150 mg/day] for 28 days).
Evidence Summary
Many of the principles regarding treatment of NWCL caused by
L. (V.) braziliensis and related species in the Viannia subgenus
are applicable to persons with ML. However, in comparison
with CL, the stakes are higher for ML (because of the risks
for substantial morbidity and for mortality); the management
issues are more complex, compounded by immunologic and
anatomic factors; few prospective clinical trials and even fewer
randomized clinical trials have been conducted [244]; and the
trials that have been conducted have, of necessity, been compar-
atively small [245].
Response rates—even with the same drug regimen—vary
widely, depending in part on interrelated factors such as the
Leishmania species/strain; the geographic region in which in-
fection was acquired [246, 247]; the particular, as well as the
number of, anatomic locations involved (eg, nasal mucosa,
palate, pharynx, larynx/epiglottis/vocal cords) [70, 248]; the se-
verity of the site-specific symptoms and signs; the duration of
the mucosal involvement; and poorly understood immunologic
and other variables. As broad generalizations, ML, compared
with CL caused by the same species/strain in the same setting,
is less responsive to antileishmanial treatment and posttreat-
ment relapse is more common. However, if ML is detected
early and is confined to the nasal (or oral) mucosa, the response
rates for ML may approach those for CL. The lowest cure rates
generally have been associated with laryngeal disease, especially
if the vocal cords are involved [42, 248]. Persons with laryngeal/
pharyngeal disease also may be at risk for respiratory obstruc-
tion, including after initiation of antileishmanial therapy, which
may trigger a Jarisch-Herxheimer–type reaction [22, 23, 126,
249,250].At-risk persons should be closely monitored; and pro-
phylactic corticosteroid therapy should be considered [22, 126],
taking into account potential benefits and risks [251, 252]. The
potential need for corticosteroid therapy and the dose and du-
ration thereof (before and during antileishmanial therapy) to
prevent or treat laryngeal/pharyngeal edema/obstruction need
to be individualized in consultation with the otolaryngologist
who performed the otolaryngologic examination. For example,
even short courses of corticosteroid therapy can be associated
with development of life-threatening strongyloidiasis [253];
therefore, laboratory screening for asymptomatic Strongyloides
stercoralis infection (and, potentially, empiric ivermectin thera-
py) may be warranted [254].
In Latin America, SbV compounds and amphotericin B deox-
ycholate generally are the most readily available and commonly
used drugs for treatment of ML [246,255]. Selected information
and perspective about these and other options are provided
below; the drugs are not necessarily discussed in order of pref-
erence for persons in North America.
In an L. (V.) panamensis–endemic area of Panama, a 28-day
course of therapy with IV SSG (20 mg SbV/kg/day) was evalu-
ated in a prospective, noncomparative clinical trial among 16
persons with disease confined to the nasal mucosa [256]. At
the last follow-up examination, up to 1 year posttherapy, 10 per-
sons (63%) were classified as cured, all of whom had received a
28-day treatment course.
In a prospective clinical trial in Peru (L. [V.] braziliensis in-
fection), using the same 28-day SSG regimen, 6 of 8 (75%) per-
sons whose ulcerative/infiltrative disease was confined to the
nasal mucosa had sustained clinical cures, without relapse dur-
ing the 12-month posttreatment follow-up period [257]. How-
ever, in the same study, only 2 of 21 (10%) persons whose
disease involved at least one additional anatomic location (eg,
pharynx or larynx) were classified as cured. To assess whether
a longer course of SbV therapy would increase the cure rate for
Peruvian persons with “multianatomic” ML, the same group of
investigators randomized such persons to receive either 28 or 40
days of IV SSG (20 mg SbV/kg/day) [258]. The per-protocol
e242 • CID 2016:63 (15 December) • Aronson et al
Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/cid/article-abstract/63/12/e202/2645609 by guest on 03 June 2019
 cure rate was 63% in both treatment groups—that is, 10 of 16
(63%) persons treated for 28 days and 12 of 19 (63%) persons
treated for 40 days had sustained clinical cures, without relapse
during the 12-month follow-up period. The investigators did
not have an explanation for the much higher cure rate in the
second compared with the first study (63% vs 10%) among per-
sons with multianatomic disease.
Adjunctive therapy with pentoxifylline, which inhibits the
production of TNF-α by mononuclear cells and modulates
the immune response [259],has looked promising in clinical tri-
als in Brazil [229, 230, 245]. In a double-blind, placebo-
controlled clinical trial, conducted in an L. (V.) braziliensis–en-
demic area (Bahia State) among persons with nasal ML, all 11
persons who received a 30-day course of combination therapy
with parenteral SbV (20 mg/kg/day) plus oral pentoxifylline
(400 mg thrice daily) were classified as cured, without relapse
during approximately 2 years of follow-up, compared with 7
of 12 (58%) persons who received SbV therapy plus placebo
[229]. The investigators previously had conducted an open-
label study among persons with SbV-refractory ML [230]; 9 of
the 10 enrolled persons treated with SbV plus pentoxifylline ful-
filled the criteria for cure after 1 year of follow-up.
Amphotericin B deoxycholate has been the traditional alter-
native to SbV therapy [260]; because it generally is considered
more toxic (with a higher risk for irreversible toxicity), in
some settings in Latin America, it has been used primarily for
persons who did not respond to SbV therapy [22]. In a random-
ized clinical trial in Bolivia and Peru, combination therapy with
amphotericin B deoxycholate plus itraconazole was not better
than monotherapy with amphotericin B [261]. In a prospective
case series among Bolivian persons with ML of variable severity
treated with amphotericin B deoxycholate (1 mg/kg every other
day for a total of 45 doses), 7 of 14 (50%) evaluable subjects and
7 of 19 (37%) total persons were classified as cured [262].
Limited, uncontrolled data from case reports/series have been
published regarding therapy with lipid formulations of amphoter-
icin B, most often with L-AmB [126, 127, 131, 214, 263–268].In 2
relativelylargeretrospectivestudies(16and29patients,respective-
ly) conducted by different groups of investigators in São Paulo,
Brazil [263, 268], the results regarding L-AmB treatment of ML
were promising, with the caveat that the studies were subject to
the many limitations inherent to uncontrolled studies in which
data are obtained by retrospective review of medical records.
Limited data regarding miltefosine therapy for ML have been
published [262, 269, 270], the bulk of which are from 2 non-
randomized clinical trials conducted in an L. (V.) braziliensis–
endemic region of Bolivia [262, 269]. In the studies in Bolivia,
the enrolled adult subjects received a daily dose of either 100
mg or 150 mg. The mean body weights of the persons in both
studies were <60 kg, whereas North American adults typically
are much heavier (see XXVI). In the first study [262], the dura-
tion of miltefosine therapy was 28 days. According to the
published report [262], 78 persons were enrolled and 51 of
the 72 (71%) persons considered evaluable were classified as
cured after 12 months of follow-up, including 21 of 36 (58%)
persons with palatal, pharyngeal, or laryngeal disease. In mod-
ified analyses [271], the intent-to-treat cure rate was 62% (49 of
79) and the per-protocol cure rate was 64.5% (49 of 76). In the
second study [269], 21 persons not previously treated with mil-
tefosine were treated for 6 weeks. Compared with persons in the
first study, these 21 persons had had mucosal disease for a much
shorter period (mean, 5 years vs 14 months, respectively). Fif-
teen persons (71% of 21) fulfilled the criteria for cure. In addi-
tion, 17 of the persons from the first study who had been treated
for 4 weeks and had not been classified as cured were located
and retreated for 6 weeks, 11 (65%) of whom were considered
cured thereafter. The investigators also assessed whether a lon-
ger follow-up period (ie, 24 vs 12 months) could increase the
relapse rate. Among the 45 persons classified as cured during
the first study who were located and reevaluated, 3 (7%) definite
or probable relapses were identified.
Limited published data are available regarding treatment of
ML with pentamidine isethionate [214], an alternative, sec-
ond-line agent [42]. Monotherapy with the parenteral formula-
tion of paromomycin (not available in North America) is not
recommended, on the basis of clinical trials in Peru and Brazil
[272, 273].
Response to antileishmanial treatment of ML typically is as-
sessed by clinical criteria. The majority of relapses occur within
the first year, but they may occur later [22, 142, 269]. The risk
factors for relapse are poorly understood [22, 274]. In persons
whose mucosal disease improved or healed during or after the
initial treatment course, relapses do not necessarily mean drug
failure (drug resistance). In some settings, reinduction therapy
with the agent initially used may be justified. Alternatives to
consider for some persons/settings include monotherapy with
a different medication or, potentially, combination therapy,
such as with pentoxifylline.
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE TREATMENT OF
VISCERAL LEISHMANIASIS
XVIII. In What Circumstances Should a Person With Visceral
Leishmania Infection Be Treated?
Recommendations.
49. We recommend that persons with clinical abnormalities
compatible with VL and laboratory evidence of VL be treated
(Table 3) (strong, moderate).
50. We suggest that clinicians closely monitor persons with
asymptomatic visceral infection and generally initiate therapy
only if clinical manifestations of VL develop (weak, very low).
Evidence Summary
All persons with symptomatic visceral infection (ie, VL) should
be treated with antileishmanial drugs and ancillary measures. If

 untreated, advanced cases of VL can result in death, in associa-
tion with progressive wasting, superinfection, or hemorrhage.
Ancillary care includes nutritional support, treatment of other in-
fectious diseases (eg, tuberculosis, malaria, or bacterial or parasit-
ic dysentery), and blood transfusions as needed. Persons newly
diagnosed with VL should also be assessed for concurrent
HIV/AIDS or other causes of cell-mediated immunosuppression.
The majority of asymptomatic L. donovani and L. infantum-
chagasi infections in immunocompetent persons in VL-endemic
areas are self-resolving, but prospective studies are lacking on
how to manage them. Among a cohort of 32 529 persons mon-
itored in L. donovani–endemic areas of India and Nepal, risk for
progression to VL disease was associated with high serologic titer
values and seroconversion during the study period [275]. If the
person can be monitored closely, understands the situation, and
is comfortable with delaying therapy, it is reasonable to follow
and initiate therapy if signs and symptoms of VL develop. Quan-
titative measures of parasite load (eg, qPCR) may eventually
prove useful in predicting who will progress to symptomatic
VL, but qPCR has not been adequately studied in immunocom-
petent asymptomatic persons and a standardized qPCR assay is
not currently available in North America (see VII).
XIX. What Is the Optimal Treatment for Visceral Leishmaniasis in a
Symptomatic Immunocompetent Person (Person Without an Identified
Immune Defect) in North America?
Recommendations.
51. For an immunocompetent person with VL, treatment with
L-AmB is recommended. The FDA-approved dosage regimen
is 3 mg/kg/day IV on days 1–5, 14, and 21 (total dose, 21 mg/
kg) (Table 3) (strong, high). Comments: Multiple regimens in
which the total L-AmB dose is 18–21 mg/kg have been used
effectively in regions other than East Africa. Doses of 40
mg/kg or more may be necessary in persons with VL acquired
in East Africa. Other lipid-associated formulations of ampho-
tericin B, such as amphotericin B lipid complex and ampho-
tericin B colloidal dispersion, are not generally recommended:
they have not been approved by FDA for treatment of VL; and
they have been less well studied in VL treatment trials (ie, bio-
equivalence has not been established).
52. For an immunocompetent person with VL caused by L. do-
novani, acquired in the Indian subcontinent (South Asia), who
is ≥12 years of age, weighs ≥30 kg, and is not pregnant or
breastfeeding, treatment with the oral agent miltefosine, 2.5
mg/kg per day (maximum, 150 mg, in 3 divided doses) for 28
days, is a possible alternative to L-AmB, particularly in persons
weighing <75 kg (see XXVI and Table 3) (strong, moderate).
Evidence Summary
The studies that served as the basis for the group’s treatment
recommendations have been summarized in review articles
[276, 277] and in the FDA Briefing Document for the Anti-In-
fective Drugs Advisory Committee Meeting on the Use of
Miltefosine (Impavido) for the Treatment of Visceral, Mucosal
and Cutaneous Leishmaniasis [271].
For persons with no identifiable immune defect who have VL
caused by either L. donovani or L. infantum-chagasi, we recom-
mend treatment with L-AmB using the FDA-approved regimen.
For many years, prolonged courses of amphotericin B deoxy-
cholate were known to be effective VL treatment in India and
elsewhere, but the drug’s use was associated with substantial
nephrotoxicity and other untoward effects (Table 4). Ampho-
tericin B interacts with ergosterol precursors in Leishmania,
disrupting the parasite plasma membrane [278]. Lipid formula-
tions of amphotericin B couple liposome protection against
renal and other toxic effects of amphotericin with deep tissue
penetration into Leishmania-infected macrophages [279].Ther-
apeutic levels of L-AmB persist for ≥2 weeks in the liver/spleen
after loading doses [280–282].
Liposomal amphotericin B (AmBisome) was approved by
the FDA in 1997 for treatment of VL, on the basis of review
of Mediterranean L. infantum dose-ranging, open-label treat-
ment studies and case series, comprising 65% of pediatric
cases [283, 284]. The FDA analysis found that the response
rates among persons who received a total dose of >21 mg/kg
or of 18 mg/kg were 100% and 97%, respectively. Data from a
large case series of L. donovani–infected persons treated in a
very rudimentary Sudanese field setting were also provided
[285]. The regimen of L-AmB that the FDA approved for treat-
ment of VL in immunocompetent persons (3 mg/kg/day on
days 1–5, 14, and 21; total dose of 21 mg/kg) does not appear
to have been used in any of the studies that were reviewed,
but it has been shown to be effective in subsequent studies
[276, 277]. A number of different dosage regimens have been
studied, including regimens with shorter durations of therapy
(eg, even just a single infusion) and various total L-AmB
doses; the FDA-approved regimen is recommended for persons
treated in North America (Table 3).
There are geographic differences in VL treatment responses
to L-AmB. In India, susceptibility to L-AmB has been observed
in large, well-conducted randomized clinical trials demonstrat-
ing high therapeutic success rates among persons with parasito-
logically confirmed VL (L. donovani). A total L-AmB dose of
10 mg/kg administered over 5 days or given as a single infusion
has been associated with an efficacy rate of 96% [277].In a large
cohort study in Bihar, India, L-AmB 5 mg/kg daily for 4 doses
over 4–10 days resulted in a therapeutic success rate of 98%
[286]. In the case of Mediterranean VL caused by L. infantum,
L-AmB in a total dose of 18 mg/kg, administered in 6 doses over
10 days, also had an efficacy of 98% [287]. In another study, a
pediatric regimen of L-AmB 10 mg/kg/day for 2 days was com-
pared with a historical control group treated with meglumine
antimoniate (20 mg SbV/kg/day for 30 days). The short course
of L-AmB was at least as effective as SbV treatment (97.6% vs
90%) [288]. L-AmB has also been used successfully to treat
e244 • CID 2016:63 (15 December) • Aronson et al

 VL caused by L. infantum-chagasi in Latin America, but the
published data are limited [289].
These results contrast with the treatment of VL caused by L.
donovani in East Africa in which the therapeutic success rate at
6 months was 85% using the FDA-recommended 7-dose regi-
men (total dose 21 mg/kg) of L-AmB, but significantly lower
with single-dose therapy of either 7.5 mg/kg (40%) or 10 mg/
kg (58%) [290]. Furthermore, in eastern Sudan, L-AmB at a
total dose of 30 mg/kg over 10 days resulted in an initial thera-
peutic success rate of 94% with 7% therapeutic failure [291]. In
Uganda and Kenya, therapeutic failure was reported to be more
common in persons with VL who received a total dose of L-
AmB of 20 mg/kg (13%) than in those treated with a total
dose of 30 mg/kg (3.9%) [292]. Finally, in an open trial of L-
AmB to treat persons in Sudan who previously had an incom-
plete parasitologic response or had relapsed after treatment with
pentavalent antimony and aminosidine or had severe disease, a
treatment regimen of 3–5 mg/kg on days 0, 3, and 10 cured 50%
of 16 persons, and 6 doses of 3–5 mg/kg on days 0, 3, 6, 8, 10,
and 13 cured 88% of 16 persons [285].
Other lipid-associated formulations of amphotericin B, such
as amphotericin B lipid complex (ABLC) and amphotericin B
colloidal dispersion, have different pharmacokinetic and toxic-
ity profiles than L-AmB and have been less well-studied in VL
treatment trials [277, 293–299]. In a randomized clinical trial
among 153 persons with Indian VL, the therapeutic success
rates with amphotericin B deoxycholate (1 mg/kg every other
day for 15 doses), L-AmB (2 mg/kg/day for 5 days), and
ABLC (2 mg/kg/day for 5 days) were 96%, 96%, and 92%, re-
spectively; the study was not powered to show differences in ef-
ficacy. L-AmB was associated with the fewest adverse reactions
per person (mean 0.6 ± 0.1): there were 14-fold more with am-
photericin B deoxycholate, and >2 fold more in the ABLC
group [300]. Finally, amphotericin B deoxycholate at 1 mg/kg
dosing either every other day for 30 days or 15 days consecutive-
ly was 95%–100% effective for treatment of Indian VL; but there
is substantially more renal toxicity, hypokalemia, and infusion-
related toxicity than with L-AmB [300–306] (Table 4).
L-AmB has associated adverse events that may prompt selec-
tion of alternative therapy. CARPA (complement activation–re-
lated pseudoallergy), caused by C3a/C5a anaphylaxitoxins
triggering mast cells and basophils, yields hypersensitivity reac-
tions that are not mediated by IgE [307].Acute infusion reactions
(occurring in the first 5 minutes and responsive to diphenhydr-
amine) can include chest pain; hypoxia; dyspnea; severe leg,
flank, or abdominal pain; and flushing with urticaria [308].
ABLC was used to treat fungal infections without severe adverse
reactions in 34 of 40 persons who previously had experienced se-
vere intolerance of L-AmB [309]. Although ABLC may be useful
for treatment of selected cases of VL, its use in this setting is less
well documented than that of L-AmB; a rough conversion factor
is that 3 mg/kg of L-AmB is similar to 5 mg/kg of ABLC. Even
though, in comparison with amphotericin B deoxycholate, L-
AmB is associated with less nephrotoxicity, 15% of persons treat-
ed with L-AmB have a 2-fold increase in their baseline serum cre-
atinine levels (AmBisome package insert) (Table 4).
For persons with VL caused by L. donovani acquired in the
Indian subcontinent who are at least 12 years of age, weigh at
least 30 kg, and are not pregnant or breastfeeding, treatment
with the oral agent miltefosine is an option (see XXVI and
Table 3). Large randomized clinical trials in India suggest that
miltefosine is effective against L. donovani infection, with cure
rates of 82%–97% [310–318]. The response rate may be lower
for VL caused by L. donovani infection acquired in East Africa.
In a clinical trial in Ethiopia among HIV-uninfected persons
with VL, the 6-month therapeutic success rate was 75.6%
[319]. Evidence is sparse to support the use of miltefosine for
VL caused by L. infantum-chagasi [320]. Miltefosine has fre-
quent gastrointestinal side effects including transient vomiting
and diarrhea; it is also teratogenic and requires birth control
measures in women of childbearing age, and it is associated
with hepatotoxicity and rarely nephrotoxicity (see XXVI and
Table 4). Development of miltefosine resistance has been a con-
cern in India. The miltefosine inhibitory concentration where
the response is reduced by 90% has been reported to be signifi-
cantly higher in geographic areas where it had been used exten-
sively in comparison with areas where its use had been limited
[321]. In addition, the posttreatment inhibitory concentration
where the response is reduced by 50% (IC50) has been signifi-
cantly higher than the pretreatment IC50 in persons who have
had a relapse [322]. Finally, decreased therapeutic success rates
and increased failure rates have been observed in India after a
decade of miltefosine use, and increasing rates of therapeutic
failure have been reported in Nepal [323, 324].
XX. What Alternative Agent(s) Can Be Used for a Person With Visceral
Leishmaniasis Who Cannot Tolerate Liposomal Amphotericin B or
Miltefosine or in Whom These Agents Otherwise Are Contraindicated?
Recommendations.
53. Pentavalent antimonial therapy (20 mg SbV/kg/day IV or
IM for 28 days) is a recommended therapy for immunocom-
petent persons with VL acquired in areas where the preva-
lence of antimony-resistant Leishmania species is low
(<10%) (strong, high).
54. We do not recommend switching to amphotericin B deox-
ycholate in persons with contraindications to, or substantial
toxicity with, L-AmB, with the exception of persons who de-
velop liposome-induced CARPA. Amphotericin B lipid com-
plex is a consideration in this situation (strong, low).
Evidence Summary
The availability, use, and toxicities of the pentavalent antimoni-
als sodium stibogluconate and meglumine antimoniate are dis-
cussed in reference to the treatment of CL in clinical question
XIII and summarized in Tables 3 and 4. Sodium stibogluconate

 20 mg SbV/kg/day IV or IM for 30 consecutive days (28 days in
some L. infantum-chagasi studies) or meglumine antimoniate
20 mg SbV/kg/day were the first-line drugs for the treatment
of VL for many decades. Reports of therapeutic failures (espe-
cially in northeast India, Bangladesh, Nepal, and Bhutan) [316,
325 ] and concerns about toxicity have led to the emergence of
L-AmB and miltefosine as first-line drugs for VL, but SbV re-
mains an option in some areas. Studies in East Africa, Brazil,
and Greece suggest that the efficacy with SbV remains in excess
of 90%–95% for both L. infantum-chagasi and L. donovani in-
fection [288, 326–328].
Pentamidine isethionate has been used to treat VL: In one
study, 4 mg/kg IM given for 20 alternate-day doses had an effi-
cacy of 77% compared with 98% for amphotericin B deoxycho-
late [329]. Pentamidine toxicity has been substantial and has
included sudden death (because of QT-prolongation effect), de-
layed symptomatic hypoglycemia, hypotension, allergic reac-
tions, and insulin-dependent diabetes [330] (Table 4).
On the basis of experience in the treatment of fungal infec-
tions, we do not recommend switching to amphotericin B deox-
ycholate for persons with contraindications to or substantial
toxicity with L-AmB. Amphotericin B deoxycholate is almost
always associated with more toxicity. Other drugs have been
used for the treatment of VL, at times in multidrug regimens.
There are published case reports and a small clinical series
with imidazole antifungals (fluconazole or itraconazole) with/
without allopurinol in persons with VL; the available data are
insufficient to recommend their use [331,332]. Parenteral paro-
momycin has looked promising in clinical trials in India, but it
is not available in North America.
XXI. In Persons With Visceral Leishmaniasis, What Parameters Should
Be Used to Assess the Clinical Response to Treatment?
Recommendations.
55. Clinical parameters correlate well with parasitologic re-
sponses to VL treatment and should be used to monitor
the response (strong, low).
56. Parasitologic confirmation of response (such as by repeat
bone marrow aspiration for microscopy and culture after
treatment) is not recommended in a patient showing a timely
clinical response. Antibody levels fall but over many months
or longer (strong, moderate).
Evidence Summary
Clinical parameters correlate well with parasitologic responses to
VL treatment. Normalization of temperature; decreased liver and
spleen size; rises in leukocytes, hemoglobin, and platelet values;
and increasing appetite and weight suggest a clinical response
[333, 334]. With effective treatment, fever typically abates in <1
week [288, 335, 336].Organomegaly is slower to resolve (approx-
imately 3–6 months), but some decrease may be seen by 10 days
after initiation of treatment, depending in part on whether
physical examination or ultrasonography is used for assessment
[288, 337]. Leukopenia and thrombocytopenia generally normal-
ize within a month, but resolution of anemia may be slower (6–12
months) [287–289, 334, 338]. Therapeutic failure (return of clin-
ical signs/symptoms in concert with parasitologic confirmation)
can occur at least up to 12 months after treatment (often the lon-
gest duration of follow-up in clinical trials), but most therapeutic
failure occurs within the first 6 months [287, 289, 337, 339–343].
Risk factors associated with death (often studied in VL popula-
tions with substantial comorbidities quite different than in
North America) include severe anemia, prolonged illness, jaun-
dice, malnutrition, age <1 year, concomitant infection, mucosal
bleeding, gastrointestinal symptoms, neutrophils <500 cells/µL,
and platelets <50 000 cells/µL [317, 344–347]. A prognostic scor-
ing system for children with VL has shown a sensitivity of 88.7%
and a specificity of 78.5% [347].
Parasitologic reassessment (such as by repeat bone marrow
aspiration) typically is not needed in persons who have a timely
clinical response and usually is reserved for subjects in clinical
trials for definitive outcome information and for individual per-
sons who remain symptomatic. Molecular analyses using semi-
quantitative and real-time PCR assays show rapid clearance of
Leishmania DNA from the peripheral blood during effective VL
treatment of immunocompetent persons, but these tests are not
standardized (various techniques, parasite targets, sensitivities),
are not routinely available for clinical use in North America,
and are not FDA approved [90, 348–353]. The results of sero-
logic testing using the rK39 immunochromatographic assay
(Kalazar Detect, InBios) may remain reactive for >1 year after
successful treatment, although early studies suggested that the
ELISA (vs dipstick) format showed declining rK39 levels after
treatment [354–356].
Post–kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL) has been iden-
tified during or after treatment of L. donovani VL in up to 10%–
27.5% of patients in India and 1.5%–60% VL in Sudan; it un-
commonly has been associated with L. infantum-chagasi VL
in otherwise immunocompetent patients [357–361]. The skin
lesions can include papules, nodules, and sometimes hypopig-
mented macules, which may coalesce into irregular patches.
There is a predilection for the face, around the nose and
mouth; but PKDL can extend to the trunk, arms, and legs.
The skin of biopsied papular lesions is infiltrated with amasti-
gotes, and persons with PKDL are a likely reservoir for VL in-
fection and a source for sand fly infection in VL-endemic
regions, perpetuating transmission.
XXII. How Should a Person With Visceral Leishmaniasis Be Treated
Who Does Not Respond to Initial Therapy as Assessed by These
Parameters (or Who Has a Relapse)?
Recommendations.
57. Immunocompetent persons with VL who do not respond
to therapy with L-AmB should be treated with an alternative
e246 • CID 2016:63 (15 December) • Aronson et al

 drug or with a higher dose or a longer course of L-AmB
(strong, low).
58. Immunocompetent persons with VL who do not respond
to initial therapy with miltefosine or a pentavalent antimoni-
al compound should be treated with L-AmB or an alternative
drug if L-AmB is unavailable (strong, low).
59. Immunocompetent persons with VL who respond to ini-
tial therapy but subsequently have a relapse should be treated
with an alternative drug or with another, potentially longer,
course of therapy with the initial drug. If L-AmB was the
drug used for initial therapy, use of a higher dose can be con-
sidered (strong, low).
60. Combination therapies may be considered but have not
been well studied after therapeutic failure in persons with
VL (weak, low).
Evidence Summary
There are insufficient data to formulate an evidence-based rec-
ommendation for a therapeutic regimen for those who initially
fail to respond. They can be treated with an alternative drug, the
same drug at higher doses or for longer periods, or a combina-
tion of drugs. The choice of drug(s) is based on the infecting
Leishmania species, the prevalence of therapeutic failure in
the geographic area of acquisition, the immune status of the
host, and potential untoward effects of the regimen.
Therapeutic failure can occur in persons without document-
ed immunodeficiency, most within 6–12 months, but it is more
likely in those with AIDS or compromised cell-mediated immu-
nity for other reasons and often represents an immunologic fail-
ure rather than a drug failure (see XXIII and XXV).
LEISHMANIASIS IN IMMUNOCOMPROMISED HOSTS
XXIII. How Should HIV/AIDS-Associated Visceral Leishmaniasis Be
Treated in Persons in North America, and What Other Management
Issues Should Be Considered?
Recommendations.
61. L-AmB is recommended for the treatment of VL in immu-
nocompromised persons in North America (Table 3) (strong,
low). Comment: The FDA-approved dosage regimen of L-
AmB for such persons, including those with concurrent
HIV/AIDS, is 4 mg/kg/day IV, on days 1–5, 10, 17, 24, 31,
and 38 (10 doses over a 38-day period), for a total dose of
40 mg/kg.
62. Combination therapy (eg, L-AmB plus miltefosine) might
be considered, especially for persons with refractory cases of
VL (weak, very low). Comment: The efficacy and optimal du-
ration of miltefosine monotherapy (and combination thera-
py) for HIV/AIDS-associated VL have not been established.
63. Because of the importance of effective immune reconstitu-
tion in HIV/VL-coinfected persons, antiretroviral therapy
(ART) should be initiated or optimized as soon as the person
is sufficiently stable to tolerate it (eg, either during or soon
after the initial course of therapy for VL) (strong, low).
64. Leishmania infection that becomes clinically manifest or
worsens after initiation of ART should be treated with anti-
leishmanial (and, if indicated, corticosteroid) therapy; leish-
maniasis-associated immune reconstitution inflammatory
syndrome (IRIS) reactions after initiation of ART have
been reported occasionally (strong, very low).
65. We recommend administering secondary prophylaxis
(chronic maintenance therapy) to decrease the risk for post-
treatment relapse of VL in persons with HIV/AIDS-associat-
ed immunosuppression (eg, CD4 T-lymphocyte counts
<200 cells/mm3) (strong, moderate).
66. Persons with VL and HIV/AIDS coinfection should be
monitored indefinitely (until effective immune reconstitu-
tion) for evidence of posttreatment relapse; ART and second-
ary prophylaxis provide only partial protection against
relapse. Antileishmanial treatment is indicated for persons
who have clinical and parasitologic evidence of recurrence
(strong, low).
Evidence Summary
Nonsterile cure of Leishmania infection is considered the norm,
even for immunocompetent persons. Residual parasites may be
present indefinitely in tissue macrophages, typically held in
check by T-cell (predominantly, CD4 cell)–dependent immu-
noinflammatory responses, including Th1-type cytokine-medi-
ated activation of macrophages [362]. However, HIV infection
increases the risk for development and recurrence of clinically
manifest VL; even visceral infection that was quiescent for years
to decades may (re)activate in the context of immunosuppres-
sion. In HIV-infected persons, the first diagnosed episode of VL
typically represents (re)activation of latent infection, and subse-
quent episodes usually constitute posttreatment relapses. How-
ever, in leishmaniasis-endemic areas, newly acquired (re)
infections may account for some VL episodes [363]. When
VL initially is diagnosed in HIV-infected persons, the CD4 T-
lymphocyte count typically is <200 cells/mm3 (often, <100
cells/mm3) [34, 36, 39, 42, 364]. The presence of other coinfec-
tions/comorbidities may complicate clinical management.
Many of the principles regarding treatment of VL in immun-
competent persons are applicable to persons with concurrent
HIV/AIDS. However, the management issues are more
complex, the evidence base is weaker, and the response to anti-
leishmanial therapy (and ART) is suboptimal. Coinfected (vs
HIV-uninfected) persons are less apt to respond to the initial
treatment course, and posttreatment relapses are much more
common.
L-AmB generally is the drug of choice for treatment of VL in
North America, regardless of whether the patient is immuno-
competent or immunocompromised. However, the FDA-ap-
proved dosage regimen of L-AmB for immunocompromised

 persons entails a higher daily dose (4 vs 3 mg/kg), number of
doses (10 vs 7), and total dose (40 vs 21 mg/kg) [284]. The op-
timal L-AmB regimen for inducing clinical remission has not
been established and undoubtedly varies by host as well as par-
asite factors, such as in different geographic regions [365–368].
Regimens including L-AmB (or, less commonly, other lipid for-
mulations of amphotericin B)—on consecutive days or in an in-
terrupted schedule (such as in the FDA-approved regimen)—to
achieve a total cumulative dose of approximately 40 mg/kg
(range, 20–60 mg/kg) have been used with variable response
rates [42, 362, 365–372].
The particular L-AmB regimen that the FDA approved in
1997 for immunosuppressed persons was selected on the
basis of analysis of limited, pooled data from 3 nonrandomized
clinical studies conducted in Europe during the pre-ART era
[283, 287, 370]. The studies included 21 immunosuppressed
persons, 17 of whom were infected with HIV. The first 10 of
the 19 immunosuppressed persons who fulfilled the FDA’s in-
clusionary criteria [284] were treated with 100 mg of L-AmB
daily for 21 days (total dose, 2.1 grams; 29–38.9 mg/kg). All
10 persons had clinical and parasitologic responses to therapy;
however, 8 persons (80%) experienced relapses during the fol-
low-up period. The other 9 evaluable persons [370], all of whom
were infected with HIV, were treated with the dosing schedule
that the FDA ultimately approved (total dose, 40 mg/kg, with
intermittent rather than daily dosing). All 9 persons clinically
improved, 8 of whom had parasitologic responses (no parasites
evident by light-microscopic examination or culture of bone
marrow aspirates), one of whom defaulted during the follow-
up period, and all of the other 7 persons experienced relapses
2–7 months posttreatment. Only one patient was still alive 26
months posttreatment. Among the other 6 persons, the mean
interval from the initial diagnosis of VL to death was 19 months
(range, 5–40 months).
Evidence from a systematic review of data regarding therapy
of HIV-associated VL—which were analyzed with indirect
comparisons, constrained by the limitations and heterogeneity
of the available data, including the paucity of randomized clin-
ical trials—has underscored that treatment with a amphotericin
B formulation (eg, L-AmB) is “superior” to pentavalent antimo-
nial (SbV) therapy [373], in part because of the safety issues as-
sociated with SbV treatment in coinfected persons (eg,
potentially life-threatening clinical pancreatitis and cardiotoxic-
ity [319,371,374–377]).Amphotericin B deoxycholate also gen-
erally is relegated to second-line status, in the context of
L-AmB’s better safety profile. If a coinfected patient in North
America needed to be treated with amphotericin B deoxycho-
late or a SbV compound, standard dosage regimens for VL gen-
erally would be used; data regarding optimal regimens for
coinfected persons are not available.
Limited data regarding treatment of HIV-associated VL with
the oral agent miltefosine have been published [319, 378–380].
In a randomized clinical trial in a population in Ethiopia with a
high prevalence of HIV infection, miltefosine (100 mg daily for
28 days) was safer but less effective than treatment with paren-
teral SSG (20 mg SbV/kg daily for 30 days) [319]. Preliminary,
uncontrolled data from Ethiopia suggest that the combination
of L-AmB and miltefosine might be more effective than mono-
therapy for VL in HIV-infected persons in that setting [381];
retrospective data regarding L-AmB/miltefosine combination
therapy for VL in coinfected persons in India also have been
published [382].
In Southern Europe, the incidence of VL (ie, of symptomatic
visceral infection) markedly decreased in the late 1990s, after
the introduction and widespread use of ART [11, 41, 42, 383–
388]. In addition, ART has been associated with improved sur-
vival among coinfected persons in Southern Europe, as well as
with longer intervals between induction therapy and relapse of
VL [38, 42, 388]. However, benefits regarding treatment out-
comes per se have not been clearly shown [34]. Standard regi-
mens of ART should be used, pending identification or
development of regimens optimized for persons with leishman-
iasis. Although in vitro data suggest that certain HIV-1 protease
inhibitors—particularly, if present at high concentrations—
might have direct inhibitory effects against Leishmania, the po-
tential clinical relevance of such data is not yet known [389].
Although the benefits of ART generally outweigh the risks,
treated persons should be monitored for adverse reactions. In-
creased toxicity may be noted if particular antiretroviral agents
are used in conjunction with SbV or miltefosine therapy [390];
for example, coadministration of SSG and zidovudine could po-
tentiate bone marrow toxicity, and ritonavir-containing prote-
ase inhibitors could potentiate gastrointestinal symptoms in
patients treated with miltefosine. Leishmaniasis-associated
IRIS appears to be relatively uncommon [391, 392].In a case se-
ries in Southern Europe, none of 11 HIV-coinfected persons
with documented subclinical visceral infection developed active
VL after starting ART [386]. Case reports have described devel-
opment of symptomatic VL in association with ART [393–395].
Other case reports have described predominantly dermatologic
(or mucosal/uveal) manifestations, often in a diffuse pattern, re-
sembling PKDL or disseminated/diffuse CL [348, 392, 396–
398].
In a systematic review, the identified risk factors for relapse of
VL in coinfected persons included a CD4 T-lymphocyte count
<100 cells/mm3 when VL initially was diagnosed, a poor incre-
mental increase in the CD4 cell count in response to ART, lack
of secondary prophylaxis, and history of a previous relapse [87].
Relapse within 1 year posttreatment is the norm, even among
persons who were treated with L-AmB and who receive ART
and secondary prophylaxis, which provide only partial protec-
tion against relapses [39, 87]. Patients should be monitored in-
definitely (until immune reconstitution) for clinical evidence of
relapse. If possible, the diagnosis should be parasitologically

 confirmed. A positive PCR result with a nonquantitative meth-
od would not confirm that the person is experiencing a relapse,
and a negative result would not exclude relapse. Although test-
ing serial blood specimens with a Leishmania qPCR assay may
help identify persons at risk for clinical relapse (ie, persons with
increasing parasitemia levels), such assays are not generally
available for clinical use in North America.
Antileishmanial treatment is indicated for persons who have
a documented recurrence of VL. At least for amphotericin for-
mulations, relapses typically represent immunologic rather than
drug failure (drug resistance) [363]. Therefore, reinduction
therapy with L-AmB typically is justified. Alternatives to
consider for some persons/settings include monotherapy with a
different medication or, potentially, combination therapy (eg,
L-AmB plus miltefosine). Even if a clinical response is noted, co-
infected persons may have serial relapses at progressively shorter
intervals and may develop chronic refractory VL [399].
Secondary prophylaxis with an effective antileishmanial drug
should be initiated after the end of the initial treatment course
(ie, to persons who respond to the induction therapy) and ad-
ministered at periodic intervals thereafter. The optimal agent
and regimen (eg, dose and dosing interval) have not been de-
fined, and comparative data regarding different regimens are
not available [87]. The results of one small, randomized clinical
trial of secondary prophylaxis have been published. Among the
8 persons who received amphotericin B lipid complex (3 mg/kg
IV) every 3 weeks, the 1-year relapse rate was 50%, compared
with 78% among the 9 persons who did not receive secondary
prophylaxis [400]. In nonrandomized studies and case series,
periodic doses of parenteral L-AmB (eg, 3–5 mg/kg every 3–4
weeks) [38, 401], pentamidine isethionate (eg, 4 mg salt/kg
[up to 300 mg per dose] every 2–4 weeks) [402–404], and
SSG (eg, 20 mg SbV/kg every 3–4 weeks) [38, 405] have been as-
sociated with decreased relapse rates. Experience using miltefo-
sine for secondary prophylaxis is limited [379, 380, 406].
Discontinuation of secondary prophylaxis can be considered
in persons without evidence of active Leishmania infection
whose CD4 cell counts on ART have been >200–350 cells/
mm3 for ≥6 months [11, 407]. However, relapses of VL have
been reported in coinfected persons with CD4 cell counts
>200 cells/mm3 or undetectable HIV RNA loads [42, 87, 372,
408, 409].
XXIV. How Should HIV/AIDS-Associated Cutaneous or Mucosal
Leishmaniasis Be Treated in Persons in North America Who Do Not
Have Evidence of Visceral Leishmaniasis, and What Other Management
Issues Should Be Considered?
Recommendations.
67. In HIV/AIDS-associated CL/ML, systemic antileishmanial
therapy is recommended, particularly in persons who are
moderately to severely immunosuppressed (eg, have CD4+
T-lymphocyte counts <200–350 cells/mm3), who may be at
increased risk for suboptimal therapeutic responses, for post-
treatment relapses, and for cutaneous, mucosal, or visceral
dissemination (strong, very low).
68. The systemic regimens used for CL/ML in otherwise com-
parable immunocompetent persons typically are recom-
mended for the initial treatment of coinfected persons,
taking into account the potentials for drug interactions and
toxicity (Tables 3 and 4) (strong, very low). Comment:
Whether coinfected persons who experience multiple post-
treatment relapses of CL/ML would benefit from secondary
prophylaxis (chronic maintenance therapy) has not yet been
established.
69. Antiretroviral therapy (ART) should be initiated or opti-
mized in accordance with standard practice for HIV/AIDS;
no evidence-based, CL/ML-specific recommendations re-
garding ART have been established (strong, low).
Evidence Summary
In HIV-coinfected persons, cutaneous, mucosal, and visceral
dissemination can be caused by essentially any of the Leishman-
ia species that infect humans [8, 11, 13], not just by species ster-
eotypically associated with diffuse CL, disseminated CL,
American ML, or VL, although the risks, pathophysiology,
and clinical manifestations may differ (eg, from those for classic
New World ML [410–414]).Even in some coinfected persons in
the Americas, clinically manifest ML has been the first identi-
fied leishmanial form, which sometimes has been followed by
the development of cutaneous lesions [11, 12, 415].
Not surprisingly, the clinical management issues are more
complex for persons with HIV/AIDS-associated CL/ML than
they are for CL/ML in general. In coinfected persons, the spec-
trum of clinical manifestations is even broader and the evidence
base is even weaker—constrained by the absence of data from
randomized, controlled treatment trials and by the heterogene-
ity of the limited anecdotal data regarding the use of various
antileishmanial agents in persons with HIV/AIDS-associated
CL/ML [9–12, 16, 214, 413, 416–420].
In general, CL/ML-coinfected (vs HIV-uninfected) persons,
particularly if severely immunosuppressed (CD4 T-lymphocyte
count <200 cells/mm3), may be less apt to respond to the initial
treatment course or to have a durable, relapse-free response [11]
and may be more likely to have drug-associated toxicity. In ad-
dition, in part because of the nonquantified risk for dissemina-
tion in such persons, use of systemic therapy generally is
considered prudent, even for treatment of seemingly focal CL.
Whether the systemic regimens used for the initial treatment of
CL/ML in HIV-uninfected persons should be modified for co-
infected persons is not yet clear [8, 11, 362].
On principle, ART should be initiated or optimized in accor-
dance with standard practice for HIV/AIDS; relatively limited
data regarding use of ART in persons who have CL/ML without
VL have been published. Clinicians should be aware of the

 potential for increased toxicity if particular antiretroviral agents
are used in conjunction with SbV or miltefosine therapy [390],
as well as the potential for interactions between antiretroviral
agents and azole/triazole drugs (including ketoconazole, itraco-
nazole, and fluconazole) [390]. Occasional cases of presentation
or worsening of CL or mucosal/uveal involvement that might
have represented IRIS reactions have been reported in the
New and Old Worlds in persons without current or past evi-
dence of VL [392, 421–427]. Leishmania infection that becomes
manifest or worsens after initiation of ART should be treated
with antileishmanial (and, if indicated, corticosteroid) therapy.
XXV. What Is the Preferred Treatment of Visceral/Cutaneous
Leishmaniasis in Immunocompromised Hosts With Solid Organ
Transplant, Persons With Lymphatic or Hematologic Malignancies, or
Persons Receiving Immunosuppressive Therapy for Other Reasons?
Recommendations.
70. Liposomal amphotericin B (L-AmB) is recommended as
the drug of choice for immunosuppressed persons with VL
(Table 3) (strong, low). Comments: The FDA-approved reg-
imen is 4 mg/kg/day IV on days 1–5, 10, 17, 24, 31, and 38
(total dose of 40 mg/kg). Higher doses and longer durations
of therapy may be needed depending in part on the level of
immunosuppression.
71. Doses of immunosuppressive drugs should be decreased in
persons with VL during antileishmanial therapy whenever
possible (strong, very low).
72. Secondary prophylaxis is not recommended for initial
management in persons with VL who have not manifested
a relapse (weak, low). Comment: Immunosuppressed per-
sons with VL who are not coinfected with HIV typically
have higher response rates to initial treatment and lower re-
currence rates than HIV-coinfected persons.
73. Routine serologic screening of organ donors from leish-
maniasis-endemic areas is not recommended. If an available
donor is known to be seropositive, it is advisable to perform
clinical and laboratory monitoring of the recipient in the
posttransplant period rather than to reject the organ for
transplant (strong, low).
74. We suggest that clinicians not routinely perform diagnostic
testing to assess persons for evidence of asymptomatic viscer-
al infection, including persons who have lived or traveled in
leishmaniasis-endemic regions (Figure 3) and are consider-
ing organ transplantation or initiation of therapy with bio-
logic
immunomodulating
agents.
Immunosuppressed
persons known or found to be asymptomatically infected
and those with a history of VL warrant close monitoring.
Neither preemptive treatment nor primary prophylaxis for
VL in asymptomatically infected persons is suggested
(weak, very low).
75. Immunosuppressed persons with VL who are not coinfect-
ed with HIV should be monitored for a minimum of 1 year
(ideally lifelong or until effective immune reconstitution) to
assess for posttreatment relapse. During clinical follow-up,
assess for symptoms and, if present, pursue parasitologic
confirmation of relapse (strong, very low).
76. Confirmed VL therapeutic failure typically can be managed
by retreatment using L-AmB at the same or a higher total dose
(strong, very low). Comment: Pentavalent antimonials could be
used in some persons with VL under close follow-up.
77. We suggest that CL/ML associated with the use of TNF-α
antagonist therapy be managed with systemic therapy and
standard drug regimens for the pertinent setting/species
(eg, geographic area where the infection was acquired)
(weak, very low). Comment: Withdrawal of TNF-α antago-
nists during antileishmanial therapy may be appropriate:
the risks, benefits, and feasibility of this action should be as-
sessed on a case-by-case basis.
Evidence Summary
With the number of immunosuppressed persons increasing
globally and travel to and from leishmaniasis-endemic regions
becoming more common, imported cases in countries where
leishmaniasis is not endemic may increase [128, 428–432]. In
the context of immunosuppression, VL can result from reacti-
vation of dormant infection or from de novo infection if the
person lives or travels in a VL-endemic area. Therefore, protec-
tive measures to prevent exposure to sand fly bites are recom-
mended, particularly for immunocompromised travelers going
to leishmaniasis-endemic regions [433, 434].
During a 2009–2012 L. infantum outbreak in Madrid, Spain,
many of the detected VL cases were in patients who were immu-
nocompromised for reasons other than HIV infection [435].
Most of the cases in this setting are VL, but CL and ML have
also been observed [213]. Among transplant recipients, VL has
been most commonly reported in recipients of renal transplants
(the most common type of solid organ transplant) but also has
been reported in recipients of other types of solid organs, includ-
ing heart, liver, and lung [86, 213, 436–439], as well as in hema-
topoietic stem cell/bone marrow recipients [213]. In VL-organ
transplant cases, the median onset time was in the first year post-
transplant, and high-dose corticosteroid use during the previous
6-month period was a risk factor for development of VL [440].
Cases of VL and CL have been associated with the use of various
immunosuppressive drugs, such as azathioprine, methotrexate,
corticosteroids, cyclosporine, and cyclophosphamide [213, 441–
443].Reports of leishmaniasis manifesting after several months of
treatment with a TNF-α antagonist suggest a higher risk in pa-
tients receiving infliximab or adalimumab than etanercept [444].
Several cancer-associated (mainly hematologic malignancies)
cases of VL have been reported, in the context of the use of var-
ious chemotherapeutic agents or monoclonal antibodies [213].
Leishmaniasis rarely has been described in patients with primary
immunodeficiency conditions [213].

Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/cid/article-abstract/63/12/e202/2645609 by guest on 03 June 2019
 During the 2009–2012 outbreak of leishmaniasis in a region
of Madrid, Spain, in which 446 cases of leishmaniasis (286 CL
and 160 VL) were identified (421 [94%] of which were defined
as confirmed), 68 cases (18 CL and 50 VL) were in persons with
at least one identified “intrinsic risk factor” [435]; only 18 of
these 68 case-patients (26%) were infected with HIV, including
2 of the 18 (11%) who had CL and 16 of the 50 (32%) with VL.
In hospitalized persons in Madrid with confirmed VL, 1% had
associated solid tumors and 2.5% had hematopoietic malignan-
cies [445]. Among 54 persons with CL in a retrospective study
for the period 1992–2012 at a tertiary care hospital in Barcelona,
Spain, 16 persons were classified as immunocompromised: 7
were infected with HIV, 4 had an autoimmune disease, 3 had
a lymphoproliferative disorder, 9 received immunosuppressive
therapy, and 2 received biologic immunomodulating therapy
[446]. In an evidence base mainly comprised of case reports,
the most common leishmaniasis-malignancy association has
been between VL and acute lymphocytic leukemia; other malig-
nancies reportedly associated with VL include acute myeloge-
nous leukemia, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, primary
cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (Sézary syndrome), Hodgkin and
non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and multiple myeloma [213, 442,
447, 448].
VL is usually diagnosed months to years after initiation of
chemotherapy, often with a prolonged regimen of multiple
courses/complicated clinical course implying longer periods
of immunosuppression. The agents associated with VL include
corticosteroids, rituximab, and fludarabine; bortezomib has
been mentioned in several case reports and bevacizumab in
one report. In patients with leukemia, potential confounding
factors include increased ascertainment of VL because of the in-
creased frequency of obtaining bone marrow biopsy specimens
(in the context of fever and cytopenias), frequent blood transfu-
sions (which, in leishmaniasis-endemic regions, could be an ad-
ditional risk factor for Leishmania infection), and common
early use of amphotericin B for empiric therapy of fever in neu-
tropenic patients (which could partially treat VL, depending on
the dosage regimen). In general, chemotherapy was held or in-
terrupted briefly during the course of antileishmanial therapy
(usually with L-AmB) but then resumed because of the life-
threatening malignancy; in some cases, this was associated
with therapeutic failure. Decisions about the use of subsequent
secondary prophylaxis for leishmaniasis should be individual-
ized, depending in part on the level and the anticipated duration
of the underlying immunosuppression.
The clinical presentation of VL in immunosuppressed pa-
tients who are not infected with HIV often resembles the syn-
drome
described
in
immunocompetent
patients
(see
Background information about leishmaniasis) [86, 441]. How-
ever, as with HIV/AIDS-associated VL (see XXIII), atypical par-
asite dissemination (see below) and severe clinical forms have
been reported in persons with advanced immunosuppression.
Severely immunosuppressed patients with VL also may have
or develop dermatologic manifestations suggestive of diffuse/
disseminated CL or mucosal involvement, which can be caused
by Leishmania species not typically associated with dermato-
logic or mucosal dissemination [410]. VL can mimic systemic
lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, or hematologic ma-
lignancy, which can lead to diagnostic errors.
The evidence base regarding treatment of VL in patients who
are immunocompromised for reasons other than HIV/AIDS
consists of case reports and small case series. Response rates
to initial treatment usually are higher and recurrence rates
lower than in HIV-infected patients, although response
rates typically are lower than those in immunocompetent pa-
tients. We suggest that VL treatment be similar to what is rec-
ommended for induction therapy (ie, L-AmB) for persons with
HIV/AIDS-associated VL (see XXIII), and that decisions about
the patient’s immunosuppressive therapy (if applicable) be in-
dividualized, taking into account the level and anticipated du-
ration of immunosuppression. Despite a lack of systematic
comparisons, L-AmB is recommended because of its safety pro-
file and generally good efficacy [42, 362, 449, 450]. If an immu-
nocompromised person with L. infantum-chagasi infection
does not have therapeutic success with L-AmB, the administra-
tion of pentavalent antimonials can be effective [451].
As with HIV/AIDS-associated CL, in persons in whom cell-
mediated immune responses are seriously compromised for
other reasons, the response to treatment of CL can be subopti-
mal; we recommend systemic instead of local therapy for CL
[362]. Species identification is important when treating CL in
immunocompromised persons because the treatment recom-
mendations or prognosis may vary (see VI) [452]. If the immu-
nosuppression is drug induced (eg, associated with treatment
with corticosteroids, TNF-α antagonists, or methotrexate), we
recommend decreasing the dose of the drug, if feasible, or, if
pertinent, withdrawing TNF-α antagonists [452]. The evidence
base for treatment of ML in immunocompromised persons is
limited [411]. In general, we recommend that CL and ML be
treated as per the recommendations for HIV-coinfected
patients.
Screening transplant donors for evidence of Leishmania in-
fection typically is not recommended. However, serologic
screening of transplant recipients who have a history of poten-
tial exposure to Leishmania may be considered before
transplantation. Iatrogenic transmission of VL via organ trans-
plantation may occur [86, 453]. Immunosuppressed persons
known to have asymptomatic infection or to have a history
of VL warrant close clinical monitoring [433]. Primary prophy-
laxis is not recommended at present. When blood qPCR testing
is available in North America, it may be helpful to detect early
reactivation (see VII) [454]. In a Brazilian study, none of the
liver recipients who had positive Leishmania PCR results at
the time of transplantation and none of the recipients of a

 PCR-positive organ developed VL during a median follow-up
period of 2 years; no prophylaxis was given [453, 455].
Secondary prophylaxis has been administered to patients
with non-HIV-related immunosuppression only in exceptional
cases, because many patients have therapeutic success without
maintenance therapy regardless of the continued use of immu-
nosuppressive medication. However, in a recent case-control
study of solid organ transplant recipients (n = 36 cases) with
VL, 26% had therapeutic failure, often in the first year after
transplantation, raising the issue of whether secondary prophy-
laxis should be considered [440].
SPECIAL POPULATIONS AND LEISHMANIASIS
XXVI. How Should the Treatment of Leishmaniasis Be Modified in
Persons Who Are Pregnant or Lactating, Are Young Children or Older
Adults, or Have Comorbidities Such as Renal, Hepatic, or Cardiac
Dysfunction?
Recommendations.
78. In general, clinically manifest cases of VL and ML should
be treated even in these special populations of persons be-
cause the benefits of treatment typically outweigh the risks.
However, patient-specific factors, including the presence of
comorbid conditions, should be considered in the selection
of the antileishmanial therapy, dosage regimen, and moni-
toring approach (Table 4) (strong, low).
79. Decisions regarding whether and how to treat cases of CL
in persons with special characteristics or comorbid condi-
tions should take into account the potential risks and benefits
of various approaches, such as initially observing without
antileishmanial therapy, deferring treatment (eg, until after
pregnancy/delivery), and using local (vs systemic) therapy
as the sole approach or as a temporizing measure, if other-
wise appropriate and feasible (strong, very low).
Evidence Summary
Basic principles applicable to all persons with leishmaniasis—
including the needs to ensure that the diagnosis is correct and
thereafter to individualize all treatment decisions (eg, whether,
when, and how to treat)—are particularly important for persons
who have special characteristics or comorbid conditions [42,
456]. However, the published information regarding special pa-
tient populations is even more limited than it is for leishmani-
asis in general, which compounds the challenges inherent to
individualizing patient care, such as assessing the probability
and magnitude of the potential risks and benefits of various
treatment and monitoring approaches. The heterogeneity en-
compassed not only by leishmaniasis but also by each of the
special populations (eg, children, older adults, persons with co-
morbidities) compounds the complexities; expert consultation
and clinical judgment typically are needed. The discussion
below focuses on selected topics, principles, and cautionary
notes. In Table 4, additional pertinent details and perspective
about antileishmanial medications are provided. Considerations
applicable to HIV-coinfected persons and to persons who are
immunocompromised for other reasons are addressed in clini-
cal questions XXIII–XXV.
Pregnant Women.
VL during pregnancy: Among the spe-
cial populations discussed in this section, the stakes are highest
for persons who have clinically manifest VL during pregnancy
—which, in case reports/series, has been associated with mater-
nal deaths, abortions/miscarriages, preterm deliveries, small-
for-gestational-age infants, and congenital transmission [42,
457–460]. In this context, the benefits of antileishmanial thera-
py during pregnancy typically outweigh the potential risks to
the fetus—particularly if persons are treated with L-AmB,
which is classified in pregnancy category B. Although relatively
limited data have been published regarding L-AmB therapy for
VL in pregnant women [291, 458, 459, 461–465], good mater-
nal/fetal outcomes typically have been reported; amphotericin
B compounds also have been safely used for treatment of sys-
temic fungal infections in pregnant women. However, as always,
treated persons should be closely monitored for adverse events
(Table 4).
Case reports and retrospective analyses of uncontrolled data
suggest that SbV therapy, especially during the first (or second)
trimester, may increase the risks for abortions/miscarriages and
preterm deliveries [42, 459, 460]. Additional cautionary notes
include the observations of embryotoxicity in laboratory ani-
mals [457,466]and of genotoxicity in a murine model, although
not in vitro [467].
Miltefosine is contraindicated during pregnancy. Although
human risk data are lacking, embryofetal toxicity (in rats and
rabbits) and teratogenicity (in rats) have been observed in ani-
mals exposed to doses lower than those recommended for hu-
mans [468, 469]. According to the FDA-approved product label
[469], women with reproductive potential should have a nega-
tive pregnancy test before starting therapy and should use effec-
tive contraception both during the treatment course and for 5
months thereafter. Although the optimal duration of posttreat-
ment contraception is not yet known [158, 470], miltefosine has
a long terminal-elimination half-life and still can be detected, at
low levels of uncertain relevance, in human plasma specimens
collected 5–6 months after a 28-day treatment course [158].Per-
sons of both sexes also should be informed that the potential for
adverse effects on human fertility has not been adequately eval-
uated but that reproductive effects have been noted in animal
studies (impaired fertility in rats of both sexes and testicular at-
rophy in male rats) [469, 471, 472].
CL during pregnancy: General principles regarding whether
and how to treat CL are applicable in the context of pregnancy.
Not all persons who have CL (vs VL) need to be treated or need
to receive (or to start with) drug therapy (eg, a combination of
wound care plus a physical modality, such as heat or cryother-
apy [191, 473], might suffice or constitute a temporizing
e252 • CID 2016:63 (15 December) • Aronson et al
Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/cid/article-abstract/63/12/e202/2645609 by guest on 03 June 2019
 measure in some persons). Not all persons who may benefit
from drug treatment need to receive systemic therapy or need
to receive it promptly (eg, in some persons, the therapy may
be postponed until later in pregnancy or after delivery). Al-
though pregnancy has been associated with development of
atypically large or exuberant CL lesions in some persons
[474–476], even those with exophytic lesions do not necessarily
need to be treated during pregnancy [474].
Various cautionary notes also apply. The effects, if any, of im-
munologic, hormonal, or other pregnancy-associated changes
on the risks for mucosal dissemination of Viannia parasites
or on the risks for development or progression of ML are not
known; the possibility of an association between untreated CL
and adverse fetal outcomes [474] has not been excluded; the po-
tential for maternal local drug therapy (eg, with intralesional
SbV or topical paromomycin) to cause fetal toxicity has not
been evaluated; miltefosine is contraindicated during pregnancy
(as discussed above); and oral azole compounds should not be
viewed as safe alternatives for pregnant women.
Lactating Women.
In general, the potential for drug-asso-
ciated risks to breastfeeding infants cannot be excluded
(Table 4). Amphotericin B probably is compatible with breast-
feeding [477]: The concentration of drug (if present at all) in
breast milk likely would be low, and its oral bioavailability is
known to be low. SbV therapy may be compatible with breast-
feeding; on the basis of data in a case report, breastfeeding in-
fants are unlikely to be exposed to detectable or toxic antimony
levels [478]. Lactating women should be advised not to breast-
feed during treatment with miltefosine or for 5 months thereaf-
ter [469]: Miltefosine is presumed to be transferred into breast
milk [468, 471]; and the possibility that a breastfeeding infant
might experience toxic effects cannot be excluded on the basis
of available data.
Children.
The morbidity that can be associated with CL,
coupled with the lack of optimal treatment modalities for
cases of CL that warrant therapy, can be especially problematic
for children. Facial lesions/scars, in particular, can have long-
lasting social and psychological consequences; however, not
all persons with CL who would or could benefit from treatment
are candidates for local therapy (see XIV); and even local (not
just parenteral) therapies may be challenging to administer
[192, 479, 480]. For example, some children may need to be se-
dated before intralesional injections of SbV [479];the need to re-
treat on multiple days compounds such issues [481]. As a broad
generalization, otherwise healthy young children typically toler-
ate systemic antileishmanial therapies as well as, if not better
than, adults—which, as discussed below regarding SbV and mil-
tefosine, might in part reflect lower drug exposures in some
children. Pediatric cases of VL (and systemic fungal infections)
have been treated with amphotericin B compounds, including
L-AmB, without reports of unusual side effects [291, 482, 483]
or of the need for pediatric-specific dosage regimens.
Dosing Issues for Systemic Pentavalent Antimonial (SbV)
and Miltefosine Therapy.
Perspective is provided below re-
garding particular dosing issues of clinical relevance—for exam-
ple, some children may have suboptimal or subtherapeutic drug
exposures when treated with parenteral SbV or oral miltefosine
according to conventional weight-based regimens.
SbV: In some studies/settings, young children (variably de-
fined) have had lower initial response rates or less durable re-
sponses to parenteral SbV therapy compared with older
children or adults treated with the same weight-adjusted dosage
regimen [484–487].In a pharmacokinetic (PK) study in Colom-
bians with CL treated with meglumine antimoniate (20 mg SbV/
kg IM daily), children aged 3–6 years had a statistically signifi-
cant (42%) lower plasma exposure to antimony (Sb) than adults
aged 20–36 years, in the context of a significantly (75%) higher
weight-adjusted renal clearance of Sb in young children [487].
To achieve Sb plasma exposures comparable to those in adults
treated with a daily dose of 20 mg SbV per kg of body weight,
young children may need higher weight- (or otherwise) adjust-
ed doses. However, this PK study was not designed to assess ex-
posure-response relationships or to assess the relationship
between drug concentrations in plasma and at the intracellular
target site; nor was it designed to evaluate the clinical need for
(or the benefits/risks of) alternative dosing regimens/algorithms,
either for this setting in Colombia or for pediatric leishmaniasis
elsewhere [487]. As a broader point also applicable to adults, the
optimal descriptor(s) of body size/physiologic function for SbV
dosing purposes has not been established. Adjustments in the
SbV dosage regimen (eg, use of a lower daily dose in mg/kg) or
selection of an alternative antileishmanial agent may be prudent
for some persons who are elderly or obese or who have pertinent
comorbid conditions (eg, renal insufficiency); see below.
Miltefosine: As of 2014, the FDA-approved indications for
miltefosine are limited to nonpregnant, nonbreastfeeding per-
sons infected with particular Leishmania species who are ≥12
years of age and weigh ≥30 kg [469];the FDA-approved capsule
size is 50 mg, although 10-mg capsules also are manufactured.
The conventional target dose is approximately 2.5 mg of milte-
fosine/kg of body weight per day, some data suggest that doses
<2 mg/kg are associated with lower response rates [488], an
upper limit of 150 mg/day was established in the past because
of poor tolerability at higher doses, and divided dosing (in incre-
ments of 50 mg) is recommended to minimize gastrointestinal
symptoms. In this context, the FDA-approved dosage regimen
for persons who weigh 30–44 kg is one 50-mg capsule twice a
day (total, 100 mg/day) for 28 consecutive days; and the maxi-
mum daily dose of 150 mg (in 3 divided doses) applies to all per-
sons who weigh ≥45 kg (≥99 pounds) [469]. Using conventional
weight-based dosing, persons who weigh >60 kg (>132 pounds)
—as most North American adults do, in contrast to the majority
of the persons in the clinical trials to date—receive <2.5 mg/kg
per day (eg, persons >75 kg receive <2 mg/kg per day).

 In the United States, use of miltefosine in persons who are
<12 years of age or who weigh <30 kg constitutes off-label
use. However, younger children ≥2 years of age were included
in some clinical trials of miltefosine for CL in South America
[485, 489, 490] and for VL in South Asia [310, 312, 323, 471,
491–495]. Of particular note, in clinical trials of VL in South
Asia and in associated PK analyses, young children (from 2
to 11 or 14 years of age), in comparison with adults, had
lower cure rates (lower initial response rates or higher relapse
rates) and lower plasma drug exposures; the maximum weight
of the adults with VL (vs CL) whose data were included in the
PK analyses was 58 kg [494].To address the apparent difference
in drug exposure between young children and adults, with the
goal of improving response rates in children with VL, a dosing
algorithm with nonlinear, allometric scaling based on fat-free
mass has been proposed [494]; in the algorithm, the maximum
daily dose remains unchanged at 150 mg. Clinical evaluations of
the allometric regimen are pending [495], and the applicability
of the proposed regimen to adults with comparatively high body
weights remains to be established.
Older Adults and Persons With Pertinent Comorbid Con-
ditions.
In general, as with other special populations, cases of
VL should be treated even in older adults and persons with co-
morbid conditions, whereas not all cases of CL need to be treat-
ed or require systemic therapy (eg, intralesional [vs parenteral]
SbV therapy may be an option for some persons [496]). Patient-
and drug-specific characteristics (eg, the likelihood and severity
of various drug-associated toxicities; Table 4) should be consid-
ered when assessing the potential risks and benefits of various
treatment and monitoring approaches. Some comorbid condi-
tions (eg, cardiac or renal dysfunction) or older age, as a proxy
or surrogate marker, may increase the risk for certain drug-as-
sociated toxicities [42, 191, 456, 497–499]. Therefore, certain
antileishmanial medications should not be used or should be
used only with additional precautionary measures (eg, expert
consultation, dosage adjustments, and more frequent monitor-
ing for toxicity) in persons with pertinent comorbid conditions
or laboratory abnormalities.
Examples of issues and principles pertinent to SbV therapy
[497] are provided here for illustrative purposes. Baseline labora-
tory testing and periodic monitoring (at least weekly) of the elec-
trocardiogram, serum chemistry values, and complete blood
count are recommended (Table 4). Because laboratory manifes-
tations of toxicity typically develop gradually, such testing/mon-
itoring should help minimize the risk for life-threatening or
irreversible adverse events [497, 500–502]. Because antimony is
renally excreted, baseline renal insufficiency, depending in part
on its severity and etiology, may warrant modifying the dosage
regimen (decreasing the daily dose or increasing the dosing inter-
val) or selecting an alternative therapy. Modifying the dosage reg-
imen, monitoring more frequently (eg, twice weekly or even more
frequently), or selecting an alternative drug also may be prudent
for some persons with baseline hepatic, pancreatic, or cardiac dis-
ease—for example, for persons with arrhythmia-associated con-
ditions, including persons who have baseline prolongation of the
corrected QT interval (QTc) or who are receiving medications
(besides SbV) that may prolong the QTc. SbV therapy should
be interrupted if concave ST segments or QTc prolongation de-
velop, especially if the absolute value of the QTc is >0.50 seconds
[497, 503] (Table 4).
