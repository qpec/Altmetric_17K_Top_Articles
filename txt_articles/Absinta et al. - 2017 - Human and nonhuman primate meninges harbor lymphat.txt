Abstract Here, we report the existence of meningeal lymphatic vessels in human and nonhuman
primates (common marmoset monkeys) and the feasibility of noninvasively imaging and mapping
them in vivo with high-resolution, clinical MRI. On T2-FLAIR and T1-weighted black-blood imaging,
lymphatic vessels enhance with gadobutrol, a gadolinium-based contrast agent with high
propensity to extravasate across a permeable capillary endothelial barrier, but not with
gadofosveset, a blood-pool contrast agent. The topography of these vessels, running alongside
dural venous sinuses, recapitulates the meningeal lymphatic system of rodents. In primates,
meningeal lymphatics display a typical panel of lymphatic endothelial markers by
immunohistochemistry. This discovery holds promise for better understanding the normal
physiology of lymphatic drainage from the central nervous system and potential aberrations in
neurological diseases.

Introduction
Recent reports (Aspelund et al., 2015; Louveau et al., 2015b) described the existence of a network
of true lymphatic vessels within the mammalian dura mater that runs alongside blood vessels, nota-
bly the superior sagittal and transverse sinuses. The dural lymphatic vessels display typical immuno-
histochemical markers that identify lymphatic vessels elsewhere in the body. They provide an
alternate conduit for drainage of immune cells and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from the brain, beyond
previously described pathways of flow: via arachnoid granulations into the dural venous sinuses, and
via the cribriform plate into the ethmoid region (Weller et al., 2009). Although early reports, based
on injections of India ink into the cisterna magna of the rat, suggested that the dural pathway
accounts for only a minority of the drainage (Kida et al., 1993), the more recent studies
(Aspelund et al., 2015; Louveau et al., 2015b), which are based on injections of fluorescent tracers
and in vivo microscopy, indicate that the dural system may be substantially more important for drain-
age of macromolecules and immune cells than previously realized.
Whether a similar network of dural lymphatics is present in primates remains unknown. Moreover,
noninvasive visualization of the dural lymphatics – a necessary first step to understanding their

SHORT REPORT
 normal physiology and potential aberrations in neurological diseases – has not been reported. We
therefore verified pathologically the existence of a dural lymphatic network in human and nonhuman
primates (common marmoset monkeys) and evaluated two magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) tech-
niques that might enable its visualization in vivo. First, the T2-weighted fluid-attenuation inversion
recovery (T2-FLAIR) pulse sequence, which is the clinical standard for detecting lesions within the
brain parenchyma, is highly sensitive to the presence of gadolinium-based contrast agents in the
CSF (Mamourian et al., 2000; Mathews et al., 1999; Absinta et al., 2015). Second, ‘black-blood’
imaging sequences, which are typically used for measurement of vascular wall thickness or detection
of atherosclerotic plaque, are tuned to darken the contents of blood vessels (even when they contain
a gadolinium-based contrast agent), but in the process the images may highlight vessels with other
contents and flow properties (Mandell et al., 2017). For comparison, we also acquired a postcon-
trast T1-weighted Magnetization Prepared Rapid Acquisition of Gradient Echoes (MPRAGE) MRI
sequence, which is widely implemented for structural brain imaging and depicts avid enhancement
of dura mater and blood vessels, but which would not be expected to discriminate lymphatic
vessels.
Results and discussion
Cerebral blood vessels have a highly regulated blood-brain barrier, protecting the neuropil from
many contents of the circulating blood. Under physiological conditions, the blood-brain barrier pre-
vents gadolinium-based chelates in standard clinical use from passing into the Virchow-Robin peri-
vascular spaces and parenchyma, so that these structures do not enhance on MRI. On the other
hand, dural blood vessels lack a blood-meningeal barrier, enabling leakage of circulating fluids and
small substances, including gadolinium-based compounds. This explains the thin, though often
incomplete, dural enhancement that is seen on conventional T1-weighted MRI scans under
eLife digest How does the brain rid itself of waste products? Other organs in the body achieve
this via a system called the lymphatic system. A network of lymphatic vessels extends throughout
the body in a pattern similar to that of blood vessels. Waste products from cells, plus bacteria,
viruses and excess fluids drain out of the body’s tissues into lymphatic vessels, which transfer them
to the bloodstream. Blood vessels then carry the waste products to the kidneys, which filter them
out for excretion. Lymphatic vessels are also a highway for circulation of white blood cells, which
fight infections, and are therefore an important part of the immune system.
Unlike other organs, the brain does not contain lymphatic vessels. So how does it remove waste?
Some of the brain’s waste products enter the fluid that bathes and protects the brain – the
cerebrospinal fluid – before being disposed of via the bloodstream. However, recent studies in
rodents have also shown the presence of lymphatic vessels inside the outer membrane surrounding
the brain, the dura mater.
Absinta, Ha et al. now show that the dura mater of people and marmoset monkeys contains
lymphatic vessels too. Spotting lymphatic vessels is challenging because they resemble blood
vessels, which are much more numerous. In addition, Absinta, Ha et al. found a way to visualize the
lymphatic vessels in the dura mater using brain magnetic resonance imaging, and could confirm that
lymphatic vessels are present in autopsy tissue using special staining methods.
For magnetic resonance imaging, monkeys and human volunteers received an injection of a dye-
like substance called gadolinium, which travels via the bloodstream to the brain. In the dura mater,
gadolinium leaks out of blood vessels and collects inside lymphatic vessels, which show up as bright
white areas on brain scans. To confirm that the white areas were lymphatic vessels, the experiment
was repeated using a different dye that does not leak out of blood vessels. As expected, the signals
observed in the previous brain scans did not appear.
By visualizing the lymphatic system, this technique makes it possible to study how the brain
removes waste products and circulates white blood cells, and to examine whether this process is
impaired in aging or disease.

 physiological conditions (Figure 1), as well as its abnormal diffuse or localized thickening in a variety
of pathological conditions (Smirniotopoulos et al., 2007; Antony et al., 2015). Using high-resolu-
tion (in-plane resolution 270 � 270 mm or finer) T2-FLAIR and T1-weighted black-blood MRI images,
obtained after the intravenous injection of standard FDA-approved contrast material (gadobutrol),
we were able to visualize the collection of interstitial gadolinium within dural lymphatic vessels (maxi-
mum apparent diameter ~1 mm) in 5/5 human healthy volunteers and 3/3 common marmoset mon-
keys (Figure 1). Our results suggest that in the dura, similar to many other organs throughout the
body, small intravascular molecules extravasate into the interstitium and then, under a hydrostatic
pressure gradient, collect into lymphatic capillaries through a loose lymphatic endothelium
(Sharma et al., 2008).
To further test this hypothesis, meningeal lymphatics were also assessed using a second gadolin-
ium-based contrast agent, gadofosveset, a blood-pool contrast agent suitable for angiography
(Lauffer et al., 1998). Gadofosveset binds reversibly to serum albumin, increasing its molecular
weight from 0.9 to 67 kDa. Under physiological conditions, albumin has a low transcapillary
exchange rate into the interstitial compartment, estimated to be on the order of 5% per hour, which
explains the propensity of gadofosveset to remain within blood vessels (Richardson et al., 2015). In
both species, gadofosveset did not reveal dural lymphatics, especially on T1-black blood images
(Figure 2 and Figure 2—figure supplement 1). As expected, on T1-weighted MPRAGE images,
gadofosveset provided superior intravascular enhancement, in both meningeal and parenchymal
blood vessels, compared to gadobutrol (Figure 2).
On 3D-rendering of subtraction MRI images (Videos 1–2, Figure 1—figure supplement 1), dural
lymphatics are seen running parallel to the dural venous sinuses, especially the superior sagittal and
straight sinuses, and alongside branches of the middle meningeal artery. The topography of the
meningeal lymphatics fits with the previously described network in rodents as well as our neuropath-
ological data (Figures 3 and 4). It is worth noting that the lymphatics visualized by MRI are large
slow-flow lymphatic ducts, whereas blind-ending and small lymphatic capillaries, clearly seen by his-
topathology (Figure 3 and Figure 3—figure supplement 1), are unlikely to be revealed by MRI. The
induction of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) did not affect detection of dural lym-
phatic vessel in either of the two animals that we tested (not shown).
To support our in vivo imaging results, we further investigated the existence and topography of
lymphatics in coronal and longitudinal sections of human and marmoset dura mater. To accomplish
this, we tested a variety of putative lymphatic endothelial markers and found that selective double
immunostaining for D2-40 podoplanin/CD31 and for PROX1/CD31 was the most effective strategy
in discriminating lymphatic vs. venous blood vessels in dura samples – a challenging task since lym-
phatics sprout from transdifferentiation of venous endothelium (Ny et al., 2005; Yaniv et al., 2006;
Srinivasan et al., 2007; Aspelund et al., 2014; Lowe et al., 2015) and persistently share some
endothelial markers. A branched network of lymphatics was clearly seen within the dura mater. On
D2-40 podoplanin/CD31 double staining, we identified a total of 93 human dural lymphatics; most
were collapsed, explaining the large range of maximum transverse diameters (range = 7–842 mm,
mean = 125 mm, standard deviation = 161 mm). The density of dural lymphatics was higher around
the venous sinuses than in more lateral areas of the dura, and higher within the meningeal layer than
the periosteal layer of the dura. As expected, red blood cells were not seen within lymphatics. In

Figure 2. Gadobutrol vs. gadofosveset in MRI-visualization of dural lymphatic vessels. Coronal T1-weighted black-blood images were acquired after
intravenous injection of two different gadolinium-based contrast agents (31 min after gadobutrol and 42 min after gadofosveset), during two MRI
sessions separated by one week. Dural lymphatics (red arrows in magnified view boxes) were better discerned using gadobutrol (standard MRI contrast
agent, which readily enters the dura) compared to gadofosveset (serum albumin-binding contrast agent, which remains largely intravascular) and were
localized around dural sinuses, middle meningeal artery, and cribriform plate (white arrows). Notably, the choroid plexus (white arrows) enhanced less

 endothelial markers (LYVE-1, D2-40 podoplanin, PROX1, COUP-TFII) and CCL21, a chemokine impli-
cated in lymphatic transmigration.
In the ongoing debate about the precise localization of lymphatics within the meninges (either
completely within the dura or ‘shared’ between the dura and the arachnoid) (Kipnis, 2016;
Raper et al., 2016), our pathological data clearly show that at least some lymphatics are contained
entirely within the dura (Figures 3 and 4). On limited evaluation, we were unable to visualize lym-
phatics within the leptomeninges, but additional dedicated studies, ideally with nonconventional tis-
sue-preparation methods, are warranted to fully explore this possibility. A comprehensive map of
the meningeal lymphatic network would have implications for unraveling the ways in which the men-
ingeal lymphatics participate in waste clearance and in immune cell trafficking within the central ner-
vous system (Louveau et al., 2015a; Kipnis, 2016; Raper et al., 2016).
In inflammatory pathological conditions, cellular migration toward the dural lymphatics might be
profoundly enhanced by specific signaling and lymphatic plasticity (Alitalo et al., 2005; Kim et al.,
2012; Stacker et al., 2014). Noteworthy in this context are clusters of extravascular CD3+ lympho-
ocytes and CD68+ phagocytic meningeal macrophages that we observed in the dura of several mul-
tiple sclerosis autopsies (not shown), confirming intense immune cell trafficking and communication.
Indeed, without proper normative comparison, we cannot rule out that the extensive presence of
small lymphatics observed in multiple sclerosis dura samples is the result of inflammation-mediated
lymphoangiogenesis. On the other hand, lymphatic dysfunction might impair waste clearance in neu-
rodegenerative diseases and aging, in line with the recently captured deposition of b-amyloid in
human dura in elderly people (Kovacs et al., 2016).
Differently from experiments implementing
injections of tracers within brain structures, here
we aimed primarily to image dural lymphatic ves-
sels in human and nonhuman primates, but we
could not prove whether dural lymphatic vessels
drain immune cells, CSF, or other substances
from the brain to deep cervical lymph nodes, nor
could we assess any link with the glymphatic sys-
tem
(Iliff
et
al.,
2012;
Xie
et
al.,
2013;
Iliff et al., 2013). Such an analysis would proba-
bly require injection of specific MRI-detectable
tracers and acquisition of MRI time-series (not
thoroughly explored in the current work), an
important future research direction for the non-
human primate work.
Overall, our data clearly and consistently
demonstrate the existence of lymphatic vessels
within the dura mater of human and nonhuman
primates.
Together
with
recent
studies
in
rodents, our results show that the meningeal
lymphatic system is evolutionarily conserved in
mammals and confirm, after exactly two centu-
ries, what the Italian anatomist Paolo Mascagni
speculated were lymphatic vessels at the surface
of human brain (Mascagni and Bellini, 1816).

with gadofosveset than gadobutrol, whereas meningeal and parenchymal blood vessels (both veins and arteries) did not enhance with any contrast
agent and appeared black. On conventional T1-weighted MPRAGE images, meningeal and parenchymal blood vessels enhanced with both contrast
agents, more clearly with gadofosveset.

(three
women, age range 28–53 years) and obtained
scans on a 3-tesla MRI unit (Skyra, Siemens
Healthcare, Erlangen, Germany), using the body
coil for radiofrequency transmission and a 32-
element phased array coil for reception.
Prior to injection of gadolinium-based contrast agent, the following high-resolution MRI sequen-
ces were collected:
1. Whole-brain T1-Magnetization Prepared Rapid Acquisition of Gradient Echoes (MPRAGE, sag-
ittal 3D turbo-fast low angle shot [TFL] sequence, acquisition matrix 256 � 256, isotropic reso-
lution 1 mm, 176 slices, repetition time [TR]/echo time [TE]/inversion time [TI]=3000/3/900 ms,
flip angle 9, acquisition time 5 min 38 s);
2. Limited T2-weighted Fluid Attenuation Inversion Recovery (FLAIR, coronal 2D acquisition over
the superior sagittal sinus, field-of-view 256 � 256, 22 slices, reconstructed in-plane resolution
0.25 mm x 0.25 mm, 42 contiguous 3 mm slices, TR/TE/TI = 6500/93/2100 ms, echo train
length 17, bandwidth 80 Hz/pixel, acquisition time 5 min), optimized for detection of gadolin-
ium-based contrast agent in the subarachnoid space (Absinta et al., 2015);
3. Black-blood scan (coronal 2D acquisition, Sampling Perfection with Application optimized Con-
trasts using different flip angle Evolution [SPACE] sequence, field-of-view 174 � 174, matrix
320 � 320, reconstructed in-plane resolution 0.27 � 0.27 mm, 64 contiguous 0.5 mm sections,
TR/TE = 938/22 ms, echo train length 35, bandwidth 434 Hz/pixel, acquisition time 7 min 50
s). A series of 2 or three overlapping coronal acquisitions were acquired to cover most of the
cerebral hemispheres;
4. Whole-brain T2-FLAIR scan (coronal 3D acquisition, SPACE sequence, field-of-view 235 � 235,
matrix 512 � 512, reconstructed in-plane resolution 0.46 � 0.46 mm, 176 1 mm sections, TR/
TE/TI = 4800/354/1800 ms, nonselective inversion pulse, echo-train length 298, bandwidth 780
Hz/pixel, acceleration factor 2, acquisition time 14 min);
5. Whole-brain T1-SPACE (axial 3D acquisition, acquisition matrix 256 � 256, isotropic resolution
0.9 mm, 112 sections, TR/TE = 600/20 ms, flip angle 120, echo-train length 28, acquisition
time 10 min).
We repeated these acquisitions after injection of gadobutrol (Gadavist, Bayer HealthCare, Whip-
pany, NJ) in all five participants. In 2 of the participants, we also repeated the entire protocol prior
to and following intravenous injection of gadofosveset (Lauffer et al., 1998) (Ablavar, Lantheus
Medical Imaging, N Billerica, MA). Injections followed the manufacturer’s suggested dosing (0.1
mmol/kg for gadobutrol, 0.03 mmol/kg for gadofosveset).

 Marmoset imaging
We studied three healthy adult common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) (one female, two males, age
range 4–11 years). After the baseline MRI, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) was
induced in 2 marmosets with 0.2 mg of fresh-frozen human white matter homogenate as previously
described (Gaita
´n et al., 2014). Marmosets were placed in a sphinx position within the magnet, and
scans were obtained on a 7-tesla MRI unit (Avance AVIII, Bruker BioSpin, Billerica, MA, USA). Data
acquisition was performed in transmit-only/receive-only mode using a homemade linear birdcage
coil (120 mm inner diameter) as a radiofrequency transmitter and a homemade, 8-channel radio-fre-
quency surface-array receiver coil assembly placed over the head of the animal. Prior to injection of
contrast agent, we collected:
1. Whole-brain T1-weighted MPRAGE scan (coronal 3D acquisition, Modified Driven Equilibrium
Fourier Transform [MDEFT] sequence, in-plane voxel size 0.15 mm x 0.15 mm, 36 contiguous 1
mm sections, TR/TE/TI = 12.5/4/1200 ms, flip angle 12 degrees, 2 segments of 1800 ms, acqui-
sition time 7 min);
2. Whole-brain T2-FLAIR scan (coronal 2D acquisition, Rapid Acquisition with Relaxation
Enhancement [RARE] sequence, voxel size 0.15 mm x 0.15 mm, 36 contiguous 1 mm sections,
TR/TE/TI = 10,000/36/2500 ms, flip angle 90–180 degrees, 2 averages, acquisition time 13
min).
We performed the same scans following intravenous injection of gadobutrol and gadofosveset, in
two different MRI sessions. Injections used single (0.1 mmol/kg for gadobutrol, 0.03 mmol/kg for
gadofosveset) or triple the recommended human dosing (0.3 mmol/kg for gadobutrol, 0.09 mmol/
kg for gadofosveset).
Image processing
Scanner-generated DICOM images were converted into NIFTI files for postprocessing. Using MIPAV
software (https://mipav.cit.nih.gov), precontrast scans were rigidly registered to postcontrast scans,
and subtraction images were created for anatomical identification of dural lymphatic vessels. 3D
skull-stripped subtraction images were then imported into Osirix software for maximum intensity
projection (MIP) 3D rendering. The same postprocessing was performed for scans acquired after
gadofosveset injection, and a direct comparison between the two gadolinium-based contrast agents
was made.
Neuropathological evaluation of human and primate dural lymphatic
vessels
Neuropathological evaluation focused on human and marmoset brain dura mater samples. Multiple
human dura samples were obtained from 2 formalin-fixed brains (60- and 77-year-olds with long-
standing progressive multiple sclerosis) and from a 33-year-old with refractory epilepsy undergoing
anterior temporal lobectomy (Figure 3—source data 1). Primate samples were obtained from 3
adult common marmosets (2 with EAE) [Figure 4—source data 1]. After general anesthesia and
transcardial perfusion of 4% paraformaldehyde, marmoset brains were extracted and stored in 10%

Figure 4. Histopathology of dural lymphatic vessels in common marmosets. MRI-histopathological correlation in a 4.4-year-old marmoset (A–F). (A, B)
Postcontrast coronal T2-FLAIR showing three enhancing lymphatic vessels within the dura, and corresponding H and E section for anatomical reference
(area of interest in the box). (C-F) Three clusters of cells (circles), surrounding the SSS and positive for lymphatic endothelial cell markers, correspond to
the three enhancing areas seen on MRI (A). LYVE-1 is a lymphatic endothelial cell marker (membrane staining), PROX1 and COUP-TFII are transcription
factors involved in lymphangiogenesis (nuclear staining), and CCL21 is a chemokine implicated in lymphatic transmigration. Higher magnifications are
shown in Figure 4—figure supplement 1. 10.3-year-old marmoset (G-I). (G) H and E coronal section showing the brain parenchyma, meninges, and

 formalin. For primate brains, MRI-matched histological sections were achieved via 7T MRI of the
fixed brain and subsequent gross sectioning with an individualized, MRI-designed, 3D-printed cut-
ting box, as previously described (Absinta et al., 2014; Guy et al., 2016; Luciano et al., 2016).
Coronal and longitudinal 3 to 7 mm paraffin sections of the dura mater were stained with hema-
toxylin and eosin (H and E). Immunohistochemical and immunofluorescent analysis for classical lym-
phatic endothelial cell markers [lymphatic vessel endothelial hyaluronan receptor 1 (LYVE-1),
podoplanin (D2-40), prospero homeobox protein 1 (PROX1), COUP transcription factor 2 (COUP-
TFII) and CCL21], were performed on representative slides. Selective double staining for lymphatic
vs. vascular endothelial markers (D2-40/CD31 and PROX1/CD31) were also executed on representa-
tive sections and implemented for histological quantification; the maximum diameter was recorded
for each lymphatic vessel, and descriptive statistics were computed. We also stained for lymphocytes
(CD3) and monocytes/macrophages (CD68). Five-mm paraffin sections of the human skin were used
as positive controls for lymphatic endothelium cell marker assessment (Figure 3—figure supple-
ment 2). For comparison, 10 paraffin human brain tissue blocks, selected for the presence of nearly
intact leptomeningeal architecture, were implemented to assess the presence of lymphatics within
the subarachnoid space and cerebral parenchyma.
Antibodies
Source, antibody type, and dilution are indicated sequentially as follows: LIVE-1 (Abcam, UK, rabbit
polyclonal, 1:200); podoplanin D2-40 (AbD Serotec, Hercules, CA, mouse monoclonal, 1:50); PROX-

COUP
TFII
(R&D
Systems,
Minneapolis, MN, mouse monoclonal, 1:200); CCL21 (Abcam, rabbit polyclonal, 1:200); CD31
(Abcam, rabbit polyclonal, 1:50); CD68 KP1 (Thermofisher, Waltham, MA, mouse monoclonal,
1:100); CD3 (Dako, Santa Clara, CA, rabbit polyclonal, 1:200); goat anti-mouse Alexafluor 488 IgG
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, 1:250) and goat anti-rabbit Alexafluor 594 IgG antibodies (Invitrogen,
1:250).
Immunohistochemistry
Immunostaining was performed on 3 to 7 mm-thick consecutive paraffin sections with antibodies to
LYVE1, D2-40 podoplanin, PROX1, COUP-TFII, CCL21, CD31, CD68, CD3 and visualized with 3,3’-
diaminobenzidine (DAB). Briefly, after deparaffinization, sections were rinsed in triphosphate-buff-
ered saline (TBS) for 10 min each, processed for antigen retrieval, and treated in 3% hydrogen per-
oxide for 10 min. Sections were blocked with a protein-blocking solution for 20 min and incubated
with the primary antibodies overnight at 4˚C or 1 hr at room temperature, then rinsed and incubated
with secondary antibodies for 30 min. The immunoreaction was visualized with DAB. After washing,
sections were counterstained with 10% hematoxylin. Stained sections were visualized and digitized
(Axio Observer Z.1, Carl Zeiss Microscopy, NY, USA). Selective double staining for lymphatic and
vascular endothelium markers (D2-40 podoplanin/CD31, PROX1/CD31), as well double staining
for D2-40 podoplanin/PROX1,were also executed on representative sections. Double staining was
performed using, in sequence, DAB horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and Vector Blue alkaline

linear vascular structure parallel to the SSS, positive for podoplanin D2-40 but not CD31. The SSS is positive for both markers, probably because of
antibody entrapment during immunofluorescence staining of the whole-mount dura. Abbreviations: H and E: hematoxylin and eosin; LV: lymphatic

 phosphatase (AP) methods. As negative control, sections of human skin, human dura mater, and
marmoset brain were stained without the primary antibodies; no background staining and/or non-
specific binding was noted (Figure 3—figure supplement 2).
Immunofluorescence
After deparaffinization, sections were treated using the same method as described above. Sections
were incubated with a cocktail of antibodies to D2-40 podoplanin and CD31 for 2 hr at room tem-
perature, then rinsed and incubated with secondary antibodies with Alexafluor 488 goat anti-mouse
(Invitrogen, dilution 1:250) and Alexafluor 594 goat anti rabbit IgG antibodies (Invitrogen, dilution
1:250), respectively, for 30 min at room temperature. After washing, sections were mounted with
DAPI Immuno Mount. Stained sections were visualized and digitized (Axio Observer Z.1, Carl Zeiss
