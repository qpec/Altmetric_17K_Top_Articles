Abstract
Background: delirium and dementia are common in the general hospital, being present in nearly 50% of older unselected
admissions to hospital. Cognitive impairment is a risk factor for delirium, but the prevalence of previously undiagnosed
cognitive impairment (dementia or mild cognitive impairment) in patients with delirium is unknown.

Undiagnosed long-term cognitive impairment in patients with delirium
Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/ageing/article-abstract/45/4/493/1680559 by guest on 02 June 2019
 Methods: we performed a prospective cohort study of people over 70 years admitted to hospital with delirium to establish the
prevalence of previously unrecognised prior cognitive impairment. Delirium was diagnosed at baseline using the Diagnostic
and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV-TR). Mild cognitive impairment and dementia were diagnosed 3 months
following recruitment in survivors using the International Working Group on Mild Cognitive Impairment criteria and DSM-
IV criteria, respectively.
Results: delirium was identified in 17.9% of older patients, and 82 participants with delirium were assessed at 3 months:
5 (6%) had persistent delirium, 14 (17%) had mild cognitive impairment and 47 (57%) had dementia. In 17 participants with
prior dementia and 14 with prior mild cognitive impairment, the diagnosis had been unrecognised, amounting to 31/82 (38%)
of all patients with delirium having some form of previously undiagnosed cognitive impairment.
Conclusion: given that over 1/3 of older patients with delirium were found to have a previously undiagnosed cognitive
impairment, the development and evaluation of services to follow-up and manage patients with delirium are warranted.
Keywords: delirium, dementia, mild cognitive impairment, MCI, general hospital, prevalence, aged, older people
Background
Delirium is a neuropsychiatric syndrome characterised by an
acute change in cognition, attentional deficits and altered
arousal [1]. It accounts for 20% of emergency hospital
admissions in older people [2]. Delirium is associated with
multiple adverse consequences including increased mortality
and new institutionalisation [3].
Dementia is a chronic neurodegenerative syndrome with
multiple causes, usually characterised by progressive cogni-
tive change including amnesic and executive deficits and
functional decline [4]. It is common in the general hospital
setting, affecting up to 40% of acute hospital admissions [5].
The true contribution of dementia on the demand for un-
planned hospital care of older people may be underestimated
because up to half of all cases of dementia found in hospital
in research had been previously undiagnosed [5]. Older
people with dementia admitted to general hospitals also have
increased adverse events [6] and higher mortality [7]. In fact,
delirium and/or dementia was present in 49% of older unse-
lected admissions in a recent cohort study [8].
People with dementia are six times more likely to be admit-
ted to hospital with delirium [9]. Given the high proportion of
undiagnosed dementia in acutely hospitalised patients in general,
we hypothesised that patients with delirium are likely to have an
especially high prevalence of undiagnosed dementia.
Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a syndrome of
reported memory loss and measurable cognitive deficit, but
with the deficit not severe enough to affect activities of daily
living. MCI affects �5% of older people and is associated
with a 5–10% yearly risk of development into dementia [10].
MCI is a risk factor for delirium [11]. Little is known about
the prevalence of MCI in general hospital or in hospitalised
people with delirium.
The prevalence of dementia in older hospital patients
with delirium ranges from 51 to 68% from eight individual
cohort studies [8, 12–20]. Only two studies however used
recognised reference criteria for the diagnosis of both delirium
and dementia [19, 20]. Two studies reported the prevalence of
unrecognised cognitive impairment. No studies reported the
prevalence of mild cognitive impairment. These studies are
summarised in Supplementary data, Table 1, available in Age
and Ageing online. No previous studies to our knowledge
report the true prevalence of undiagnosed dementia in hos-
pital patients with delirium by reference criteria. The objective
of this prospective study was to identify accurately the propor-
tion of people admitted as unplanned admissions to hospital
with delirium with both previously diagnosed and undiag-
nosed dementia and mild cognitive impairment. By determin-
ing these proportions, we aimed to determine the extent to
which prevalent delirium is a marker of previously undiag-
nosed dementia and mild cognitive impairment.
Method
A prospective cohort study was carried out. Unselected
patients aged 70 and over with an unplanned medical admis-
sion to a UK teaching hospital between March 2013 and
November 2014 were screened by a single trained assessor
(a specialist in geriatric medicine) for delirium. The screening
used the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) [21],
Abbreviated Mental Test Score (AMTS) [22], the Digit Span
test and a detailed review of the medical notes. Participants
were eligible for the study if they met the Diagnostic and
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders fourth edition
(DSM-IV-TR) criteria for delirium [23]. The screening took
place on 143 days evenly spread over the period. Potential
participants who were unable to communicate because of
severe sensory impairment or inability to communicate in
English were excluded, as were those deemed to be at risk of
imminent death.
Patients with delirium were then invited to participate.
Informed consent was sought from the potential participant
if they had the mental capacity to give it. For those who
lacked the mental capacity to give informed consent, the next
of kin was consulted in accordance with the provisions of the
Mental Capacity Act with respect to participation in research,
and they were asked also to agree to act as informants.
Baseline data were collected including demographic data,
the Charlson Co-morbidity Index and the Clinical Frailty

 Index [24, 25]. Review of the medical record accompanied
an informant interview that enquired about a previous diag-
nosis of dementia or MCI, and a history of prior cognitive
function, but no new diagnoses of dementia were made at
baseline due to the difficulties of distinguishing dementia
from delirium in the presence of the latter.
At 3 months, a follow-up assessment was undertaken in
survivors, at the patient’s own home or hospital if they were
still an in-patient, by the same assessor who had seen them at
baseline. The presence of persistent delirium was first estab-
lished using DSM-IV-TR criteria for delirium. If no delirium
was present, a standardised history and examination, includ-
ing the Addenbrooke’s Cognitive Examination III (ACEIII)
[26], was performed to establish the presence or absence of
dementia or mild cognitive impairment before the onset of
the delirium. Dementia and subtype was diagnosed using the
DSM-IV-TR criteria [27]: (i) the development of multiple
cognitive deficits, including memory impairment, and (ii) the
impairment is sufficiently severe to cause impairment in occu-
pational or social function. MCI was diagnosed using the
current consensus definition [28]: (i) the person is neither
normal nor demented, (ii) there is evidence of cognitive decline
and (iii) that activities of daily living are preserved and complex
instrumental functions are either intact or minimally impaired.
The final diagnosis was made synthesising all available in-
formation in relation to the 6-month period before delirium
hospitalisation, to make the diagnosis of either dementia or
MCI at the index admission. The symptoms of cognitive and
functional decline had to have been present for at least
6 months prior to the admission with delirium, as indicated
by DSM-IV
. It is not possible to diagnose DSM-IV dementia
in the presence of delirium, so follow-up at 3 months was
chosen as the best balance to allow recovery from delirium
and ensuring an accurate and near-contemporaneous diagno-
sis of dementia at the index admission.
Data were analysed using IBM SPSS version 20 for
Windows. Descriptive statistics were used to describe the
proportions of cognitive diagnoses given to the cohort with
95% confidence interval calculated. Differences between
common clinical variables were analysed, using the inde-
pendent t-test, Kruskall–Wallis test or χ2 test depending on
the normality of the variables and whether the variables were
continuous or categorical. Odds ratios to predict the risk of
having previously undiagnosed dementia were calculated
using univariate binary logistic regression.
The study was reported using the Strengthening the Report-
ing of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE)
statement [29].

Ethical and regulatory approvals were obtained (Bradford
Ethics Committee, part of the Yorkshire and Humber
National research and Ethics Service, ref: 12/YH/0534).

Results
Of 1,668 available older people admitted to hospital, 1,327
were screened for delirium between March 2013 and
November 2014. Of these, 228/1,327 (17.2%) were diag-
nosed with DSM-IV-TR delirium. One hundred and
twenty-five of 228 (54.8%) were recruited. The main reason
for non-recruitment was lack of an available next of kin to
act as consultee (57/103).
Of the 125 recruited, 45 (36%) had a previously recog-
nised diagnosis of dementia. The diagnosis had been made
by a GP in 4/45 (9%) cases, a geriatrician in 7/45 (16%)
cases and an old age psychiatrist in 34/45 (76%) cases. 32/
45 (71%) had been assessed in a memory clinic and 17/45
(38%) were on cognitive enhancing drugs.
Of the 125 recruited, 82 (66%) were followed up at
3 months: 25 (20%) had died, 10 (8%) declined the follow-
up visit and 8 (6%) were not contactable. There was no dif-
ference in age, gender or admission dementia status between
those followed up and those not. The mean age of the fol-
lowed up sample was 84.4 years and 65.9% were female. 21/
82 (24%) were from a care home. Figure 1 shows participant
flow.
At 3 months, 5/82 (6%) had persistent delirium, 14/82
(17%) were diagnosed with prior MCI, 47/82 (57%) were
diagnosed with dementia and 16/82 (20%) had no evidence
of prior cognitive impairment. Of the 47 with dementia, 31/
47 (66%) had Alzheimer’s disease, 12/47 (26%) had vascular
dementia, 3/47 (6%) had mixed dementia and 1/47 (2%)
had dementia with Lewy bodies: 17 (21%) had probable de-
mentia that was present at index admission but not diag-
nosed. MCI had not been previously diagnosed in any of
those in whom it was diagnosed at the 3-month follow-up.
Of these newly diagnosed cases, 12 were diagnosed with
Alzheimer’s disease and 5 with vascular dementia. In total,
31/82 patients who had been admitted to hospital with delir-
ium had previously undiagnosed cognitive impairment, that
is either dementia or MCI. Figure 2 illustrates these propor-
tions with 95% confidence intervals.
The group with prior cognitive impairment had a higher
burden of co-morbidity (median co-morbidity index 2.0
versus 0.0, P = 0.002) and frailty (median clinical frailty scale
5.5 versus 4.0, P < 0.0005) than the group with no prior cog-
nitive impairment. See Table 1.
Fifty of the 82 had no recognised diagnosis of dementia
when admitted to hospital with 17/50 (34%) of those diag-
nosed with dementia at follow-up. When trying to predict
unrecognised dementia at admission from the group admit-
ted with no recognised diagnosis of dementia, age and frailty
were significantly associated with having unrecognised de-
mentia. Univariate logistic regression demonstrates that every
increased year of age was associated with a 12% increased
risk of having unrecognised dementia (OR 1.12, 95% CI
1.01–1.25) and every increased point in the Rockwood clinic-
al frailty scale was associated with a 2.5-fold increased risk of
having unrecognised dementia (OR 2.58, 95% CI 1.34–

Ageing online.
Discussion
The main findings in this study are that nearly four in five
older emergency medical patients with delirium also have de-
mentia or MCI, and that half of those with dementia or MCI
did not have a prior diagnosis. Our findings are consistent
with previous studies of dementia prevalence in older
patients with delirium, which report a range of 51–68% [8,
17]. Delirium was diagnosed on admission in 17% of older
people in our cohort, which also is in keeping with previously
reported prevalence rates (15–25%) [2, 30].
This study adds to prior reports finding that unrecog-
nised cognitive impairment is common among patients
with delirium. However, no previous studies have reported
the proportion of cases of delirium who had undiagnosed
dementia at presentation diagnosed according to the refer-
ence standard, and none have previously reported the
prevalence of prior mild cognitive impairment patients pre-
senting with delirium. Two studies report the prevalence of
unrecognised cognitive impairment. In a study measuring
drug metabolism in older patients with delirium, ‘probable
dementia’ was recorded using a validated informant ques-
tionnaire (Informant Questionnaire of Cognitive Decline in
the Elderly, IQCODE) and informant interview [15]. The
assessment was carried out at the time of admission, and
63/105 patients with delirium had probable dementia. Of

 those, 37/105 (35%) had no prior diagnosis. A further
study reported the proportion of undiagnosed cognitive im-
pairment in delirium, reporting that in only 5 of 28 partici-
pants with delirium and cognitive impairment, a diagnosis
of dementia was recorded in medical notes [18]. Here the
IQCODE administered over the telephone was used to
classify previous cognitive impairment.
The ascertainment at 3 months of pre-delirium dementia
and MCI used standardised diagnostic processes which
included the assessment of cognition at that point, and
hence, post-delirium cognitive impairment could potentially
have led to an over-estimation of the number of cases of
prior dementia or prior MCI in borderline cases. We judge
this risk to be small, as the amount of post-delirium cognitive

Undiagnosed long-term cognitive impairment in patients with delirium
Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/ageing/article-abstract/45/4/493/1680559 by guest on 02 June 2019
 impairment is small, and the diagnoses of prior MCI and
prior dementia rarely relied solely upon the cognitive assess-
ment made at 3 months.
Although the study did not recruit all patients admitted to
hospital with delirium, the main reason for non-recruitment
was a lack of a consultee. There was no difference between
the age or sex of those who were and were not recruited, so
this is unlikely to have caused a significant bias in our results.
Recognising the difficulty of separating delirium from de-
mentia, we applied formal reference standard criteria for the
diagnosis of delirium and dementia, using a trained assessor
and using assessment at 3 months rather than solely on
admission: for these reasons, we believe these findings to
be robust. Persistent symptoms of delirium were present at
3 months in 5 (6%) participants, though this may have repre-
sented a new episode at assessment.
The significance of the finding of a high proportion of
people with delirium having prior undiagnosed cognitive im-
pairment is that, not only is delirium an important diagnosis
to make in older patients admitted to hospital [31], it also
presents a strong opportunity to identify dementia and MCI
[32]. A timely diagnosis of dementia during hospital admis-
sion may ameliorate adverse events associated with a hospital
stay [6],allow suitable resource allocation, such as signposting
to a cohort ward [33], or trigger for comprehensive geriatric
assessment [34]. In the longer term, diagnosing patients with
dementia allows identification of those who would benefit
from pharmacological therapy [35]. Patients could then be
counselled, advised and offered post-diagnostic support, or
offered the opportunity to participate in research. This
would not be possible without these diagnoses being recog-
nised. In the UK, there is a government drive to improve de-
mentia diagnosis rates through the National Dementia
Strategy [36] and the Prime Minister’s dementia challenge
[37], and similar activities are also occurring worldwide.
Routine follow-up of patients who have presented with delir-
ium could therefore be of value—to identify those with per-
sisting delirium as well as to identify previously unrecognised
dementia and mild cognitive impairment.
A frailty measure, the Clinical Frailty Scale, would appear
to have discriminating ability in identifying those with delirium
who also have dementia (Table 1 and Supplementary data,
Table 2, available in Age and Ageing online). This suggests that
there is also value in the assessment of frailty in this cohort.
Further work is now required to develop follow-up proce-
dures to identify unrecognised dementia and to evaluate their
cost effectiveness. Although screening tools for dementia in
the acute hospital setting exist [38], future work should con-
centrate on developing optimised tools to identify dementia
and MCI accurately in people with delirium, as well as evalu-
ating the potential benefits timely diagnosis in hospital offers.
Conclusions
Dementia in acutely hospitalised older patients is common
and is associated with poor acute and long-term health
outcomes, yet it is currently under-diagnosed. Our findings
confirm that older people in hospital with delirium are a
high-risk group for undiagnosed cognitive impairment (de-
mentia and MCI). Delirium is therefore a target condition to
screen or case-find for dementia in general hospitals.
However, improved identification in hospitals and validated
methods of evaluation and follow-up of older people with
delirium in hospitals are needed. Practitioners should con-
sider adopting informant interviews and other methods in
detecting possible dementia in older acute hospital patients
with delirium.
Key points

impairment.
• 57% of patients with delirium had DSM-IV dementia.
• One-third of patient with dementia had previously undiag-
nosed dementia.
• One-third of older patients with delirium were found to
have a previously undiagnosed cognitive impairment.
