M
oyamoya disease (MMD) is an uncommon cerebrovas-
cular disease that is characterized by progressive steno-
sis of the terminal portion of the internal carotid artery and its 
main branches.1 There have been many studies on the cere-
bral hemodynamics in patients with MMD,2–4 and based on 
their findings, current guidelines recommend revasculariza-
tion surgery in patients with MMD with progressive ischemic 
symptoms or evidence of inadequate blood flow or cerebral 
perfusion reserve.5
The mechanism of ischemic stroke in MMD is not well 
understood, and the roles of therapeutic strategies, other than 
surgery, are unknown.6 Given the lack of systematic evidence 
on antiplatelet agents and anticoagulants for stroke prevention 
in patients with MMD, specific stroke prevention medications 
cannot be recommended outside of general treatment recom-
mendations. However, pathological data showed collapse of 
the artery lumen and intraluminal thrombosis in patients with 
MMD.7 There is also some evidence that supports thrombo-
embolism as the cause of infarction in patients with MMD.8,9
The present study aimed to explore the mechanism of isch-
emic stroke in patients with MMD. Thus, we evaluated the 
infarct pattern and collateral status, using multimodal magnetic 
resonance (MR) imaging, in patients with MMD. In this study, 
we investigated acute infarct pattern on diffusion-weighted 
imaging (DWI), microembolic signals on transcranial Doppler 
monitoring, and collateral status using our dynamic susceptibil-
ity contrast (DSC)–enhanced, MR perfusion–based collateral 
map10 to estimate the role of embolic and hemodynamic mecha-
nisms in the development of stroke in adult patients with MMD.
Patients and Methods
Patient Selection
We prospectively recruited patients >18 years of age with MMD admit-
ted to the tertiary, university stroke center between January 2008 and 
Background and Purpose—Moyamoya disease (MMD) is a unique cerebrovascular disease characterized by the progressive 
stenosis of large intracranial arteries and a hazy network of basal collaterals, called moyamoya vessels. Although 
hemodynamic studies have been applied in MMD patients, the mechanisms of stroke in MMD are still unclear. The 
present study evaluated the infarct pattern and collateral status using multimodal magnetic resonance imaging in MMD 
patients.
Methods—Adult MMD patients with acute ischemic stroke were prospectively recruited, and infarct pattern on diffusion-
weighted imaging was evaluated. A collateral flow map, derived from magnetic resonance perfusion–weighted imaging 
data, was generated through automatic postprocessing, and collateral status was assigned into 3 grades. Transcranial 
Doppler monitoring was performed to detect microembolic signals in selected patients.
Results—A total of 67 hemispheres (31 patients with bilateral and 5 patients with unilateral MMD) were analyzed. Most 
patients (83.7%) showed embolic pattern and rarely deep (9.3%) or hemodynamic infarct pattern (7.0%) on diffusion-
weighted imaging. Most cases (86%) showed good collateral status, and few patients with acute infarcts of embolic 
pattern showed poor collateral status (n=7). One third (31.6%) of patients who underwent transcranial Doppler monitoring 
showed microembolic signals.
Conclusions—In the studied population of adult MMD patients, embolic phenomenon played an important role in ischemic 
stroke. Therapeutic strategies against thromboembolism, as well as collateral enhancing strategies targeting improvement 
of hemodynamic status or increased washout of emboli, are warranted.

 112  Stroke  January 2017
October 2015. Patients included in this study met the following crite-
ria: (1) diagnosed with MMD by digital subtraction angiography find-
ings according to the Japanese MMD guideline11 and its revision by 
the Research Committee for MMD of the Japanese Ministry of Health, 
Labor, and Welfare in 2015; (2) presenting with acute ischemic stroke 
demonstrated on DWI; (3) had magnetic resonance perfusion–weighted 
imaging (MRP) performed; and (4) had no prior bypass surgery, such as 
encephalo-duro-arterio-synangiosis, extraintracranial arterial bypass, or 
both. This study was approved by the local institutional review board.
Evaluations
Demographic features and vascular risk factors, including hyper-
tension, diabetes mellitus, and dyslipidemia, were investigated. We 
assessed angiographic Suzuki’s grade for assessing disease severity 
of MMD. Both hemispheres were evaluated separately for presence 
of acute infarction, Suzuki’s grade, and collateral grade using MRP-
derived collateral flow map. Infarct patterns were categorized into 
3 groups based on the DWI patterns: (1) embolic pattern, including 
territorial infarcts, cortical infarcts, or mixed cortical-deep infarcts; 
(2) isolated subcortical pattern, defined as deep infarcts restricted to 
the territory of the penetrating arteries; (3) hemodynamic pattern rep-
resented with internal border-zone infarction. Cortical border-zone 
infarcts were categorized as embolic pattern because it was reported 
that internal border-zone infarcts were caused mainly by hemody-
namic compromise, whereas embolic pathogenesis appeared to con-
tribute greatly to the genesis of cortical border-zone infarcts.12 In 
addition, we measured the long axis of the acute infarction, and some 
of the patients underwent transcranial Doppler monitoring.
MRP Methods and Image Analysis
MR imaging was performed using a 3T Philips Achieva MR scanner 
(Philips Medical Systems, Best, Netherlands). Identical model of the 
MR scanner was used for all study subjects. Typical MR imaging 
sequence for acute stroke assessment included DWI, DSC-MRP–
based collateral map, fluid-attenuated inversion recovery, and MR 
angiography of the cervical and intracranial vessels (3-dimensional 
time-of-flight MR angiography and contrast-enhanced MR angiogra-
phy, including the extracranial carotid and vertebral arteries).
DWI was performed with 2 levels of diffusion sensitization (b val-
ues of 0 and 1000 s/mm2; 5- to 7-mm slice thickness; no gap). DSC-
MRP was performed using gradient-echo and echo-planar imaging 
techniques, after administration of intravenous gadolinium (Dotarem 
[gadoterate meglumine]; Guerbet, Aulnay-sous-Bois, France) with a 
repetition time of 1718 ms, for a total acquisition time of ≈90 s, with 
20 to 22 slices. The contrast agent was injected with a power injector 
at a dose of 0.1 mmol/kg body weight, with a flow rate of 3 mL/s, into 
an antecubital vein, via an 18-gauge intravenous cannula, ≈7 s after 
the start of the acquisition. Other parameters for the DSC-MRP were 
as follows: echo time =35 ms, flip angle =40°, acquisition matrix 
=128×128, field of view =24×24 cm2, section thickness =5 mm, and 
intersection gap =2 mm. In total, 1000 DSC-MRP raw images, com-
posed of 50 time points per slice, were obtained.
Perfusion delay was defined based on the perfusion parameter Tmax. 
Tmax is the time to the peak of the residue function map, generated 
by deconvolution of the tissue concentration over the time curve, 
using an arterial input function from the contralateral middle cerebral 
artery.13 The MRP postprocessing and data analysis were performed as 
described in our previous studies.10,14 MR imaging volume measure-
ments were performed by an investigator (J.P. Son) who was blinded to 
the clinical information. Tmax volumes were stratified using a 2-s strata 
of Tmax thresholds, from Tmax2–4 s, Tmax4–6 s, …, Tmax22–24 s, and Tmax>24 s. 
Because of too small volumes, Tmax12–16 s and Tmax18–22 s were merged into 
4-s strata to avoid the possibility of under- or overestimation.
Postprocessing Techniques to Generate an 
MRP-Derived Collateral Flow Map
Collateral flow maps were generated based on source data derived 
from DSC-MRP, as previously described.10 Collateral flow maps 
were automatically generated using in-house software, Fast 
Analysis System for Collaterals, developed using MATLAB 
(MathWorks, Natick, MA). All steps were typically completed 
within 5 minutes. There was a good correlation between the MRP-
based and the digital subtraction angiography–based collateral 
grades.10 Criteria for collateral flow map–based grades were chosen 
based on the American Society of Interventional and Therapeutic 
Neuroradiology/Society of Interventional Radiology grading sys-
tem15 with a classification of grade 0 (no visible collaterals), grade 
1 (slow collaterals, visible only during the late phase, toward the 
part of the occluded middle cerebral artery territory with a per-
sistence of some of the defect), grade 2 (rapid collaterals, visible 
during the mid to late phase, toward the part of the occluded middle 
cerebral artery territory with a persistent defect portion), grade 3 
(slow, but complete, collateral flow to the ischemic bed), and grade 
4 (complete and rapid collateral flow to the entire vascular bed in 
the occluded middle cerebral artery territory). Six axial slices of 
the collateral flow maps were used to assess the leptomeningeal 
collateral grade. The striatocapsular region was not assessed owing 
to limitations of digital subtraction angiography–based collateral 
grading in this region. For statistical analysis, hemispheres were 
divided into 3 groups according to the MRP-derived collateral 
grade: poor (digital subtraction angiography grade 0–2), intermedi-
ate (grade 3), and excellent (grade 4). Collateral flow images were 
reviewed independently by 2 investigators (D.Y. Kim and J.P. Son) 
aware of the symptomatic side and occlusion site. When the rat-
ings between the 2 raters were inconsistent, a decision was made 
by consensus.
Statistical Analysis
Numeric data are presented as mean±SD, and categorical data are 
presented as percentage. T tests, Fisher’s exact tests, Mann–Whitney 
tests, and Kruskal–Wallis tests were used to compare binary and 
continuous variables between groups. Statistical analyses were per-
formed using SPSS version 18.0 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL). All calcu-
lated P values were 2-tailed, and statistical significance was defined 
as P<0.05.
Results
During the study period, a total of 268 patients, who met 
the diagnostic criteria of MMD, were identified, and 62 
patients were confirmed to have acute ischemic stroke 
based on DWI. Among them, patients with no MRP (n=22), 
lost imaging data (n=2), concomitant brain tumor (n=1), 
and iatrogenic infarction during angiography (n=1) were

excluded. A total of 36 patients were finally enrolled, 
and total of 67 hemispheres, including 5 cases of unilat-
eral MMD, were analyzed (Figure 1). One of the patients 
had recurrent ischemic stroke with interval period of 23 
months, so each stroke event was included in the analy-
sis. The mean age at diagnosis was 45.1±11.8 years. There 
was a slight predominance of female patients in our sample 
(female:male ratio =1.77), and two patients had a family 
history of MMD.
Among 43 hemispheres with acute infarcts, 36 (83.7%) 
showed embolic pattern, 4 (9.3%) showed isolated subcorti-
cal pattern, and only 3 (7.0%) showed hemodynamic pattern 
on DWI. Representative images are shown in Figure 2. There 
was no significant difference in sex, age at diagnosis, family 
history, and vascular risk factors depending on the DWI pat-
tern. All the patients with stenosis (without occlusion) showed 
embolic pattern; however, embolic pattern was also observed 
in cases of total occlusion. Transcranial Doppler monitoring

was performed in 19 patients, and out of those, 6 patients 
(31.6%) showed positive embolic signals.
Collateral status was examined on large intracranial arter-
ies in 50 hemispheres with occlusion, on either symptomatic 
(DWI+) or asymptomatic (contralateral) side. If there was 
stenosis, rather than occlusion, collateral grade assessment 
using MRP could not be applied because collateral flow is 
developed by retrograde flow when there is no anterograde 
flow. Most cases (86%) showed relatively good collaterals and 
complete retrograde perfusion to the vascular bed in the entire 
ischemic territory, such as intermediate (slow retrograde per-
fusion by the late venous phase) or excellent (rapid retrograde 
perfusion) collateral grades. Only 7 hemispheres had poor col-
laterals; 5 hemispheres (10%) showed rapid collaterals to the 
periphery of the ischemic site, but only to a portion of the 
ischemic territory, with persistence of some of the defect; and 
2 hemispheres (4%) showed slow collaterals to the periphery 
of the ischemic site, with persistence of some of the defect. 
Collateral grade was significantly different depending on the 
infarct pattern (P=0.016; Figure 3). Poor collateral grade was 
observed only in the embolic group, but about three fourths 
of that group showed intermediate or good collaterals. Poor 
collaterals were not observed in the nonembolic group or con-
tralateral (DWI−) hemispheres. Excellent collateral grade was 
observed in more than two thirds of DWI+ hemispheres, in 
half of those of nonembolic pattern, and a third of those of 
embolic pattern.
There was a trend of a larger size of infarction coinciding 
with a poorer collateral grade: the infarct size on DWI was 45 
mm (interquartile range, 38–60 mm) for poor, 32 mm (15–55 
mm) for intermediate, and 18 mm (6–37 mm) for excellent 
collaterals (P=0.054). Although all the patients showed some 
degree of Tmax perfusion delay, perfusion in the ischemic site 
was observed at a later time point (Tmax>16 s) in most patients, 
except in those with poor collaterals (Figure 2A1 and 2A2).
Discussion
The main findings of this study were the following: (1) most 
of the diffusion restriction patterns (83.7%) were of embolic 
type, and hemodynamic pattern was rarely observed in the 
acute symptomatic patients with MMD; (2) microembolic 
signals could be observed in approximately a third of patients 
(31.6%) in transcranial Doppler monitoring; and (3) most 
hemispheres (86%) showed good collateral status, and few 
patients with acute infarcts of embolic pattern showed poor 
collateral status. Contrary to previous line of thought, our 
results suggest that ischemic stroke is more likely to be because 
of thromboembolism than to collateral failure. Although there 
have been studies of impaired vascular reserve in patients 
with MMD, studies evaluating the degree of collateral status 
in MMD are relatively limited. To the best of our knowledge, 
this is the first study to address the stroke mechanisms and 
collateral status, using multimodal imaging techniques, in a 
relatively large cohort of patients with MMD.
Most ischemic cerebrovascular events in patients with 
MMD were attributed to reduced blood flow caused by 
obstruction of major intracranial arteries. Data from our pres-
ent study emphasize embolic phenomenon as the predomi-
nant mechanism of brain infarction in MMD. Embolism from 
intraluminal thrombosis may be involved in the development 
of ischemic stroke in MMD. Yamashita et al7 evaluated his-
topathologic changes of moyamoya vessels in 22 patients 
with MMD and showed intraluminal thrombosis in the ste-
notic segment and microaneurysm formation or attenuation of 
vessel thickness. Our transcranial Doppler results are in line 
with previous case reports, suggesting that microembolism is 
associated with disease progression and development of brain 
infarction in patients with MMD.9,16
Our present collateral map results showed that collateral cir-
culation was well developed in MMD, except in some patients 
with acute symptomatic MMD. This may be, in part, because 
MMD has a chronic course allowing enough time for collater-
als to develop. In addition, MMD may be a disease outcome of 
enhanced angiogenesis.6,17 When vessels are occluded, collat-
eral circulation develops to stabilize cerebral blood flow, but 
the collateral vessels in MMD may be small, weak, and prone 
to hemorrhage/aneurysm and thrombosis. Collateral vessels 
of MMD, the moyamoya vessels, are dilated perforating arter-
ies that have various histopathologic changes, including fibrin 
deposits in the wall, fragmented elastic laminae, attenuated 
media, and the formation of microaneurysms.1,7 Thus, aberrant 
collaterals could be the source of thromboembolism occlud-
ing distal branches of collateral flows. Atypical distribution of 
infarct pattern supports this hypothesis.18
Direct or indirect surgery is the main strategy for treat-
ment in patients with MMD for improving regional cerebral 
hemodynamics.19–22 Bypass surgery improves cerebral per-
fusion and also helps washout thromboemboli in patients 
with MMD. Caplan et al described that hypoperfusion and 
embolism often coexist in the mechanism of infarction,

and the interrelationship involves 2 factors: decreased per-
fusion limiting blood flow to regions rendered ischemic by 
emboli and decreased blood flow impeding washout of the 
emboli.23,24 Our results showed that embolic infarcts occurred 
exclusively in patients with poor collaterals, suggesting the 
role of established strategies (eg, bypass surgery) for enhanc-
ing collaterals in MMD. Beside surgical approaches, further 
studies on the role of antiplatelet agents in MMD are needed. 
The use of dual antiplatelet agents was reported to reduce 
microembolism in atherosclerotic, occlusive, cerebrovascu-
lar diseases.25,26 In addition, cilostazol was reported to have 
pleiotropic effects, such as inhibition of smooth muscle cell 
proliferation27 and activation of endothelial progenitor cells 
for angiogenesis.28 However, no clinical trials have been con-
ducted to evaluate the role of antiplatelet agents in MMD 
patients.
Our study has several limitations. First, MMD is a rare dis-
ease, and this study contains a small number of patients. In 
addition, this is a single-center study conducted in a university 
hospital, and so the sample could be affected by selection bias. 
In regard to the MRP-derived collateral grade, because it was 
initially developed for evaluation of collateral status in acute 
infarction of middle cerebral arteries, the implications of the 
MRP-derived collateral grade in the chronic stage of MMD 
were not validated. Finally, data on vascular reserve were not 
analyzed in this study because studies of vascular reserve, such 
as Diamox single-photon emission computed tomography, 
were performed at the chronic stage of stroke, while the col-
lateral status was examined at the acute phase of stroke.
In conclusion, embolic mechanism plays an important role 
in ischemic stroke of patients with MMD, and good collateral 
status in patients with MMD might be associated with wash-
out of emboli. Taking into account the contribution of these 2 
mechanisms, therapeutic strategies against thromboembolism, 
as well as collateral-enhancing strategies targeting improve-
ment of hemodynamic status or increased washout of emboli, 
might be an important treatment option for preventing throm-
boembolic stroke in MMD.
