Aims
The data regarding the associations of body mass index (BMI) with cardiovascular (CVD) risk, especially for those
at the low categories of BMI, are conflicting. The aim of our study was to examine the associations of body
composition (assessed by five different measures) with incident CVD outcomes in healthy individuals.

Methods
and results
A total of 296 535 participants (57.8% women) of white European descent without CVD at baseline from the UK
biobank were included. Exposures were five different measures of adiposity. Fatal and non-fatal CVD events were
the primary outcome. Low BMI (<
_18.5 kg m-2) was associated with higher incidence of CVD and the lowest CVD
risk was exhibited at BMI of 22–23 kg m-2 beyond, which the risk of CVD increased. This J-shaped association
attenuated substantially in subgroup analyses, when we excluded participants with comorbidities. In contrast, the
associations for the remaining adiposity measures were more linear; 1 SD increase in waist circumference
was associated with a hazard ratio of 1.16 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.13–1.19] for women and 1.10 (95% CI
1.08–1.13) for men with similar magnitude of associations for 1 SD increase in waist-to-hip ratio, waist-to-height
ratio, and percentage body fat mass.
...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Conclusion
Increasing adiposity has a detrimental association with CVD health in middle-aged men and women. The associ-
ation of BMI with CVD appears more susceptible to confounding due to pre-existing comorbidities when com-
pared with other adiposity measures. Any public misconception of a potential ‘protective’ effect of fat on CVD risk
should be challenged.

Introduction
The obesity epidemic is an emerging public health problem with sub-
stantial consequences for health care expenditure and overall quality
of life and wellbeing.1 Recent data from the World Health
Organisation suggest that over half of the adult population worldwide
is currently overweight [body mass index (BMI) >
_25kgm-2] or obese
(BMI >
_30 kgm-2),2 and researchers project that the obesity preva-
lence will increase by 33% over the next two decades impacting fur-
ther on global health burden and cost.3 A large body of data have
underscored the deleterious effect of high BMI on the risk of myocar-
dial infarction, stroke, cancer, and overall mortality.4–9 However,
there is a large body of evidence supporting the so-called ‘obesity
paradox’ concept, which posits that being overweight or even obese
is ‘protective’ of, or has no impact on, cardiovascular (CVD), and
overall mortality,10 especially in elderly individuals or with diagnosed
coronary disease or other severe medical conditions.11,12 The obes-
ity paradox is also discussed in recent ESC CVD prevention guide-
lines13 in relation to people with existing CVD so more clarity on this
topic is needed.
The confusion about the relationship of adiposity with adverse
outcomes is exacerbated by data reporting that low BMI (<20kgm-2)
is associated with increased risk of CVD, cancer, and all-cause mor-
tality relative to BMI between 20 and 25 kgm-2.14 These data, along
with other data supporting the obesity paradox, could lead to the
confusion that being overweight or obese may be protective against
CVD compared with having a normal weight. The reasons for these
paradoxical findings are unknown, but issues with the use of BMI to
quantify weight status may contribute. Indeed, BMI may be more sus-
ceptible to the impact of disease,15 compared with other adiposity
measures, as individuals with subclinical disease may lose weight due
to muscle mass loss before a clinical diagnosis is made,16 whereas
percentage body fat mass may continue to increase and fat distribu-
tion may not necessarily change. Furthermore, BMI has limited value
in distinguishing between lean and fat mass or accounting for fat dis-
tribution,17 as central adiposity (i.e. waist circumference) rather than
BMI correlates more strongly with visceral fat.18
The lack of robust data linking other body composition measures,
on top of BMI, with long-term outcomes has further contributed to
the persistence and re-stating of conflicting findings that can result in
erroneous, or at least potentially confusing, public health messages.
UK Biobank is a large, well phenotyped cohort with a variety of body
composition measures, which allows us to study the above associ-
ations in well selected groups attenuating reverse causality bias.
Therefore, the aim of our study was to examine the continuous asso-
ciations of several body composition measures (BMI, waist circumfer-
ence, waist-to-hip ratio, waist-to-height ratio, and percentage body
fat) with the incidence of CVD (morbidity and mortality) in healthy
individuals.
Methods
Study design and participants
UK Biobank is a large prospective study which, between 2006 and 2010, re-
cruited 502 664 participants (response rate 5.5%), aged 40–69years, who
consented for their records to be linked with routine data (national hospital
and death registries). Participants attended one of 22 assessment centres
across the UK where completed a touch screen questionnaire, had physical
measurement taken and provided biological samples as described in detail
elsewhere.19,20 At the time of analysis, follow up was available for both hos-
pital and death data up to August 15th 2015 for England, August 14th 2015
for Wales, and June 22nd 2015 for Scotland. Participants of non-White
European descent were excluded from all the analyses (n= 28 892) as eth-
nicity modifies the association between adiposity and vascular health.
Participants with any CVD at baseline [self-reported or from hospital re-
cords (ICD I00-I99)] were excluded from the analyses looking at the associ-
ation of body composition markers with incidence of CVD (n= 170058).
A landmark analysis of events occurring from 2 years after recruitment was
conducted to minimise the impact of reverse causality on the associations
with the incidence of CVD.
Exposures
Exposures were five adiposity markers; BMI is the ratio of the measured
body mass in kg divided by the squared height measured in metres.
Height was measured using a Seca 202 height measure. Weight was
measured to the nearest 0.1 kg using the Tanita BC-418 MA body com-
position analyser. The natural indent was measured for the waist circum-
ference (the umbilicus was used if the natural indent could not be
observed). The hip circumference was recorded at the widest part of the
hips. Waist-to-hip ratio and waist-to-height ratio are the ratios of waist-
to-hip circumference and waist circumference to height, respectively.
Percentage body fat was measured using the Tanita BC-418 MA body
composition analyser (fat mass divided by the total body mass). All expos-
ures were treated as continuous variables. Body mass index of 22kgm-2
was the referent value for BMI.6 The referent value for the other adipos-
ity measure was the corresponding value of each measure for BMI of
22kgm-2 by regressing the BMI on each adiposity measure.
Outcomes
Information about incident CVD after recruitment was available from
hospital and death registries. These registries use the International
Classification of Diseases system version 10 (ICD-10) for coding out-
comes. The primary outcome was CVD (fatal and non-fatal events);
defined as an ICD 10 code of I00-I99. Secondary outcomes were CVD
mortality, non-fatal CVD events, and a composite outcome of ischaemic
heart and cerebrovascular events (ICD I20-I25 and ICD I61-I67 and I69).
Other variables
Age was treated as a continuous variable. Tobacco smoking (never smok-
ers, current smokers, and ex-smokers), frequency of alcohol intake (daily,
three to four times a week, once or twice a week, less frequently than
once a month, or never), and diabetes diagnosed by a doctor (yes, no)
were self-reported. Townsend quintiles (measure of deprivation based
on four census variables; unemployment, non-car ownership, non-house
ownership, and household overcrowding) and educational qualifications
(higher degree, any school degree, vocational qualifications such as
Higher National Certificate or Higher National Diploma, other qualifica-
tions, or none of the above) were used as measures of socioeconomic
status. Moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) was calculated in
minutes per day (continuous) based on the answers in short version of
the International Physical Activity Questionnaire and was truncated to
360 min per day (if reported higher). MVPA was used because of its direct
associations with CVD.21 Systolic blood pressure was the average of two
readings taken by trained personnel.

Statistical analysis
We used multivariable cubic regression splines to model the associations
between adiposity measures and each outcome using the mvrs command
in Stata. When there was evidence of non-linearity, we firstly created un-
restricted cubic splines. We then fitted a Cox proportional hazard re-
gression model with unrestricted cubic splines for each exposure and a
post estimation command to plot the hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confi-
dence intervals (CIs) for each unit of the exposure against the referent
category.22 For linear relationships, we examined the associations be-
tween each adiposity measure, as a continuous covariate without further
transformation, and CVD outcome with a Cox proportional hazard re-
gression model. Prior to fitting the Cox regression models, we checked
that the proportional hazards hold.
The start of follow up was 2 years post the date of the baseline visit for
the associations with the incidence of CVD. Contributions to risk were
censored at the date of the first outcome event of interest, death from
any cause, or end of the follow-up period from those who remained alive
and free of the outcomes of interest. We present fully adjusted models
for age, socioeconomic status (Townsend quintiles and qualification),
smoking, alcohol intake, MVPA, diabetes, and systolic blood pressure at
baseline. We performed supplemental analysis without adjusting for dia-
betes and blood pressure because they can be mediators instead of con-
founders of the associations. We stratified the analysis by sex because of
sex differences in body fat distribution and risk of CVD. We checked by
fitting non-linear functions whether smoking or physical activity modified
the associations between adiposity and CVD outcomes.
We carried out sensitivity analysis for the associations of adiposity
measures with CVD events in healthy individuals by restricting the ana-
lyses to non-smokers and secondly non-smokers without comorbidities.
The specific comorbidities considered were self-reported at baseline and
included diabetes, cancer, chronic liver disorders, alcohol and substance
abuse, eating disorders, depression, anxiety, inflammatory bowel disease,
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and inflammatory disorders (e.g.
rheumatoid arthritis, polyarthropathies). We additionally performed ana-
lysis without excluding the first 2 years of follow up. We also looked at
the associations of adiposity measures with CVD mortality and morbidity
separately and with a composite outcome including only ischaemic heart
and cerebrovascular events (ICD I20-I25 and ICD I61-I67 and I69).
We reported the percentage of missing values of each variable.
Participants with <2% missing values for a confounding variable or missing
values on the exposures of interest were excluded from the analysis.
None of the confounding variables had >2% missing values.
As secondary analysis, we compared the performance of each adipos-
ity measure at predicting CVD events; we calculated the area under the
curve of receiver operator characteristics (AUROCs) and the continuous
net reclassification index (NRI) for each univariate model compared with
that of BMI. We also looked how many participants were reclassified to
lower (0–5% risk) or higher (5–10%) risk category depending on the adi-
posity measure used whether the outcome is present or absent.23 We
also explored the correlations of each adiposity metric with each other
by estimating all pairwise correlation coefficients.
All analyses were performed with Stata (version 14, StataCorp LP, College
Station, TX, USA) and R (R version 3.3.1, https://www.r-project.org).
Results
The study population comprised the 296 535 UK Biobank partici-
pants of white European descent without prevalent CVD at baseline
who were followed up for an average of 5 years (interquartile range
4.3–5.6). Of this population 171 285 (57.8%) were women, 5667
(3.3%) of whom developed a CVD event, and 125 250 (42.2%) were
men, 7187 (5.7%) of whom developed a CVD event, during the
follow-up period. Table 1 shows the cohort characteristics stratified
by sex.
The referent value for BMI was 22 kgm-2.6 Referent values that
corresponded to BMI of 22 kgm-2 (by regressing the BMI on each adi-
posity measure) were for waist circumference 74 and 83cm; for
waist-to-hip ratio 0.78 and 0.88; for waist-to-height 0.38 and 0.42; for
percentage body fat mass 30 and 18% for women and men,
respectively.
Figure 1 shows the adjusted HR and 95% CI for CVD events for each
adiposity measure for women and men, respectively. Very low BMI
(<
_ 18.5kgm-2) was associated with higher incidence of CVD and the
lowest risk of CVD was exhibited at BMI of 22–23kgm-2 and there-
after the incidence of CVD increased monotonically up to BMI of
35kgm-2 for men and of 45kgm-2 for women. Whereas, for the re-
maining adiposity measures the associations were log-linear where a
higher adiposity was associated with greater risk of CVD events.
Supplementary material online, Figures S1 and S2 presents the adjusted
HR with 95% CI for non-smoker men and women, respectively, with-
out comorbidities. For non-smoker men without comorbidities the
higher risk at low BMI disappeared. Supplementary material online,
Figure S3 presents the adjusted HR with 95% CI for the participants
without excluding those that their follow up was terminated within the
first 2 years and the results are comparable with that in Figure 1.
Supplementary material online, Figure S4 presents the associations of
adiposity measures with the composite outcome of ischaemic heart
and cerebrovascular events and Supplementary material online,
Figures S5 and S6 present the association of adiposity measures
with fatal and non-fatal events separately, without the results
changing substantially compared with that for the primary
outcome of CVD events.
Table 2 presents the HR for CVD events per 1 SD increase in each
adiposity measure in women and men without pre-existing disease at
baseline. One SD increase in BMI (5.2kgm-2 for women and
4.3kgm-2 for men) was associated with a 13% higher (HR of 1.13,
95% CI 1.10–1.17) in both women and men in the risk of CVD events
for BMI over 22kgm-2. One SD increase in waist circumference
(12.6 cm for women and 11.4cm for men) was associated with a HR
of 1.16 (95% CI 1.13–1.19) for women and 1.10 (95% CI 1.08–1.13)
for men for CVD events. One SD increase in waist-to-hip ratio (0.07
for women and men) was associated with a 10% (HR of 1.10, 95% CI
1.07–1.13) and a 9% (HR of 1.09, 95% CI 1.06–1.12) increase in the
risk of CVD events. One SD increase in waist-to-height ratio (0.08
for women and 0.07 from men) was associated with a 14% (HR of
1.14, 95% CI 1.11–1.18) and 9% (HR 1.06, 95% CI 1.06–1.12) increase
in the risk of CVD events. Similarly, 1 SD increase in percentage body
fat mass (6.9% for women and 5.8% for men) was associated with a
HR of 1.12 (95% CI 1.09–1.15) in women and 1.06 (95% CI 1.03–
1.09) in men. The associations became slightly stronger when we did
not adjust for blood pressure and diabetes (Supplementary material
online, Table S1).
Supplementary material online, Table S2 presents the AUROC and
NRI for each adiposity measure used as predictor of CVD event
compared with the model using BMI. Waist circumference, waist-
to-hip-ratio, and waist-to-height ratio present marginally better dis-
criminatory characteristics than BMI in predicting a CVD outcome,

whereas body fat mass have limited value compared with BMI.
Supplementary material online, Table S3 shows the correlation coeffi-
cients for each pair of adiposity measures; BMI correlates moderately
with other measures (e.g. correlation coefficient of 0.43 with waist-
to-hip ratio to 0.87 with waist-to-height ratio).
Moderate to vigorous physical activity did not modify the associ-
ations between adiposity measures and CVD outcomes (P for inter-
action >0.05 for each association) so we do not present stratified
analyses per physical activity level. Smoking was an effect modifier for
the association between BMI and CVD in men without CVD at base-
line (P = 0.001).
Discussion
We demonstrated that the J-shape association of BMI with the inci-
dence of CVD, which is in accordance with the findings from other
cohorts,6 almost disappeared in subgroup analysis in participants
without comorbidities or in the non-smokers, whereas the associ-
ations of the remaining adiposity measures with the incidence of
CVD were generally unchanged before or after such adjustments.
These observations collectively suggest that the observed detrimen-
tal ‘impact’ of low BMI on CVD outcomes is likely a result of con-
founding.24 Our study has extended previous work, which looked
only at associations of BMI with health outcomes by demonstrating
novel associations with other well validated measures of adiposity
and fat distribution. The size and wealth of information of the UK
Biobank enabled comprehensive subgroup analyses and evidence of
attenuation of the impact of confounding on the previously reported
association of BMI with CVD. Our findings strongly reaffirm that
being overweight heightens the risk of CVD and that individual
should seek to keep their weights as close to recommended levels to
lessen their risks of CVD. These findings may therefore have implica-
tions for future guidelines.
The impact of confounding with smoking, on the associations of
BMI with CVD has been demonstrated previously in smaller cohort
studies.25,26 Weight loss prior to diagnosis of disease is well re-
ported.15 In addition, individuals with comorbidities (e.g. rheumatoid
arthritis) are more likely to have decreased body mass as a result of
lean mass loss27 but they have greater risk of CVD.28 Therefore, the
disproportionally greater number of ill people in the low categories
of BMI that are at increased risk of CVD events inflate the HR of
CVD events in this BMI category. We extended our analysis to the
associations of other adiposity measures, that are less likely to be af-
fected by pre-existing illness (since illness is associated with lean ra-
ther than fat mass loss27), and we demonstrated a linear association
between central and total body fat with the risk of CVD. That a study
using mendelian randomisation analysis29 did not replicate the associ-
ation of low BMI with greater risk of CVD supports our assertion
that the association of low BMI with greater risk of CVD is not causal.
On the contrary, mendelian randomization analysis supported the
causal relationship of higher abdominal adiposity (measured by waist-
to-hip ratio) with greater risk of coronary heart disease.30
Previous evidence has suggested that measures of abdominal adi-
posity have stronger associations, than BMI, with the incidence of pri-
mary myocardial infarction31 or CVD mortality,32 which may be
mediated through the impact of visceral fat (or other ectopic fats) on

adverse metabolic profile.33 Our findings show that increasing ab-
dominal adiposity is associated with a higher hazard for CVD, that
the magnitude of the associations are comparable with that, or po-
tentially slightly superior to BMI in predicting future CVD, however,
one accepts we did not have lipid values to adjust for which may
capture some of this excess predictive ability. It is possible that meas-
ures of central adiposity may complement or be useful alternatives to
the use of BMI in CVD risk stratification, especially for those individ-
uals with low BMI. We acknowledge that BMI is a more easily repro-
ducible than central adiposity measures.4
Take home figure The obesity paradox is mainly due to the effect of confounding on BMI and disappears on other adiposity measures.

The HRs correspond to 1 SD increase in each adiposity marker. HR are fully adjusted for age, diabetes, systolic blood pressure, moderate to vigorous physical activity,
Townsend quintile, qualifications, alcohol intake, and smoking. Analyses are stratified by sex. HRs for BMI are shown for <22 kg m-2 and >
_22 kg m-2 because of the U-shape rela-
tionship between BMI and incidence of CVD.

Our study importantly extends previous analyses of studies look-
ing at the relationship between adiposity and CVD.4,5 It is the largest
prospective study linking increased body fat measured with bioimpe-
dance with future CVD events and refutes previous conflicting find-
ings, which were either based on smaller cohorts including
participants with existing disease34,35 or where the effect of body fat
was diluted by over-adjustment for other adiposity markers.35,36 Our
findings in respect to BMI and waist circumference are in line with
accumulated data from prospective studies, not inclusive of the UK
Biobank,4–6 adding external validity that their association with CVD
risk are genuine. Our relatively modest effect size of the associations
compared with that in the aforementioned meta-analyses might be
attributed to our additional adjustment for physical activity which has
attenuated the associations, the relatively shorter follow-up duration
and the contemporary nature of the cohort which is likely to be asso-
ciated with better CVD prevention.
Strengths and weaknesses
UK Biobank is a unique resource, which includes a large contempor-
ary cohort with consistent measures of adiposity and homogenously
defined outcomes and risk factors. The ongoing linkage with death
and hospital registries minimises the number of cases that are lost
from follow up. It is the largest study linking body fat measured with a
validated technique with the incidence of CVD. We used robust ana-
lysis examining non-linearity and treating exposures as a continuum
rather than categorising them at arbitrary levels. Our landmark and
sensitivity analyses contribute to minimise effect of bias of undiag-
nosed disease, comorbidities and smoking on adiposity, however, we
accept there may still be residual confounding. We restricted our
analysis to participants of White European disease as ethnicity modi-
fies the association between adiposity and vascular health5 and there
was not adequate number of events for Subgroup analyses of other
ethnic groups.
We acknowledge that our study has some limitations; it can be
argued that the low response rate (5.5%) to the UK Biobank recruit-
ment may have introduced a healthy responder bias to the analyses.
While this would limit the ability to generalize prevalence rates which
is beyond the scope of the study, estimates of the magnitude of asso-
ciations regarding disease or mortality risk in the current study are
not expected to be affected by this.37,38 That the shape of associ-
ations for BMI and waist circumference in our study are comparable
to that in previous reports4–6 provides additional assurance that the
low response rate has not had a substantial impact on the findings.
We did not have access to lipid or glycaemia biomarkers; however,
they are likely to be additional mediators of the association between
adiposity and CVD, not confounders.39 Measurement of fat with im-
pedance is a well-validated technique,40 and further analyses should
be undertaken using imaging data (still in its infancy in UK Biobank)
on abdominal fat storage and ectopic fat depots.
Conclusion
In conclusion, increasing adiposity, whether total body and ‘central’
adiposity measures, have generally adverse associations with CVD
outcomes in middle-aged men and women. Public health campaigns
should emphasize the importance of an individual intentionally
maintaining as lean a phenotype as possible to gain maximum CVD
benefits. The association of BMI with CVD is more susceptible to bias
rather than other adiposity measures and, therefore, health care pro-
fessionals should challenge any public misconception of some ‘pro-
tective’ effect of fat on CVD risk.
