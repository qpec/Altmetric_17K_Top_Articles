IMPORTANCE Warfarin use accounts for more medication-related emergency department
visits among older patients than any other drug. Whether genotype-guided warfarin dosing
can prevent these adverse events is unknown.
OBJECTIVE To determine whether genotype-guided dosing improves the safety of warfarin
initiation.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS The randomized clinical Genetic Informatics Trial (GIFT) of
Warfarin to Prevent Deep Vein Thrombosis included patients aged 65 years or older initiating
warfarin for elective hip or knee arthroplasty and was conducted at 6 US medical centers.
Enrollment began in April 2011 and follow-up concluded in October 2016.
INTERVENTIONS Patients were genotyped for the following polymorphisms:
VKORC1-1639G>A, CYP2C9*2, CYP2C9*3, and CYP4F2 V433M. In a 2 × 2 factorial design,
patients were randomized to genotype-guided (n = 831) or clinically guided (n = 819) warfarin
dosing on days 1 through 11 of therapy and to a target international normalized ratio (INR) of
either 1.8 or 2.5. The recommended doses of warfarin were open label, but the patients and
clinicians were blinded to study group assignment.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary end point was the composite of major
bleeding, INR of 4 or greater, venous thromboembolism, or death. Patients underwent a
screening lower-extremity duplex ultrasound approximately 1 month after arthroplasty.
RESULTS Among 1650 randomized patients (mean age, 72.1 years [SD, 5.4 years]; 63.6%
women; 91.0% white), 1597 (96.8%) received at least 1 dose of warfarin therapy and
completed the trial (n = 808 in genotype-guided group vs n = 789 in clinically guided group).
A total of 87 patients (10.8%) in the genotype-guided group vs 116 patients (14.7%) in the
clinically guided warfarin dosing group met at least 1 of the end points (absolute difference,
3.9% [95% CI, 0.7%-7.2%], P = .02; relative rate [RR], 0.73 [95% CI, 0.56-0.95]). The
numbers of individual events in the genotype-guided group vs the clinically guided group
were 2 vs 8 for major bleeding (RR, 0.24; 95% CI, 0.05-1.15), 56 vs 77 for INR of 4 or greater
(RR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.51-0.99), 33 vs 38 for venous thromboembolism (RR, 0.85; 95% CI,
0.54-1.34), and there were no deaths.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among patients undergoing elective hip or knee arthroplasty
and treated with perioperative warfarin, genotype-guided warfarin dosing, compared with
clinically guided dosing, reduced the combined risk of major bleeding, INR of 4 or greater,
venous thromboembolism, or death. Further research is needed to determine the
cost-effectiveness of personalized warfarin dosing.

 F
or at least the last 10 years, warfarin use has accounted
for more medication-related emergency department
visits among older patients than any other drug.1,2
Warfarin dose requirements vary widely among individuals
because of common single nucleotide polymorphisms
(SNPs).3,4 Because knowledge of a patient’
s genotype should
lead to more accurate warfarin initiation and a concomitant
reduction in adverse events, the product label for warfarin
(Coumadin and others)5 has encouraged genotype-guided
dosing since 2007.
However, multicenter studies of genotype-guided dos-
ing of oral vitamin K antagonists have had mixed results.6-14
The 2 largest trials7,8 found no improvement in the primary
end point of international normalized ratio (INR) control. In
contrast, the European Pharmacogenetics of Anticoagulant
Therapy (EU-PACT) trial of 445 patients found improved
INR control with genotype-guided warfarin dosing.9 Thus, it
remains unclear whether genotype-guided dosing improves
the safety of warfarin initiation.6-9
The goal of this multicenter randomized clinical trial was
to determine whether genotype-guided warfarin dosing re-
duced adverse events.
Methods
The Genetic Informatics Trial (GIFT) of Warfarin to Prevent
Deep Vein Thrombosis was a multicenter randomized clinical
trial of patients initiating warfarin at the time of elective hip
or knee arthroplasty.15 We used a 2 × 2 factorial design to ran-
domize participants to genotype-guided or clinically guided
dosing of warfarin on days 1 through 11 of therapy and to a tar-
get INR of 1.8 or 2.5. The results of genotype-guided vs clini-
cally guided dosing of warfarin on days 1 through 11 of therapy
are presented in this article (the trial protocol appears in
Supplement 1).
Patients were randomized 1:1 using a computerized sys-
tem that stratified by site, type of arthroplasty (knee or hip),
and race (black vs other). Randomization was stratified based
on race because the CYP2C9*2 and CYP2C9*3 SNPs are less
common among populations with African ancestry com-
pared with other populations.16 Race was self-identified using
standard National Institutes of Health categories. The ran-
domizationsequencewasgeneratedbytheWarfarinDosing.org
webmaster at IsoDynamic.com.
Participantsandstudypersonnelwereblindtostudygroup
assignment and genotype; however, the warfarin dosing was
open label. The study was approved by the institutional re-
view boards at each site, the US Food and Drug Administra-
tion (FDA), and the US Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Ser-
vices. All participants provided written informed consent in
accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.
Patients planning to undergo elective hip or knee arthro-
plasty who were aged 65 years or older and had a life expec-
tancy of longer than 6 months were recruited for the trial.
Exclusion criteria were patients with (1) a genotype or thera-
peutic warfarin dose known from prior therapy, (2) prior
nonadherence, (3) contraindication to warfarin, (4) a treat-
ment plan to receive an anticoagulant other than warfarin,
(5) known thrombophilia, (6) a bleeding disorder, (7) a seri-
ous bleeding event within past 2 years (unless caused by
trauma), (8) a baseline INR of 1.35 or greater, or (9) an addi-
tional indication for warfarin (eg, atrial fibrillation).
Trial Procedures
Testing for the INR was performed per standard practice.
Warfarin was initiated either the night prior to arthroplasty
(standard practice at Washington University in St Louis,
St Louis, Missouri; University of Utah, Salt Lake City; and
University of Texas Southwestern, Dallas) or the night of
arthroplasty (standard practice at Hospital for Special Sur-
gery, New York, New York; Intermountain Healthcare,
Salt Lake City, Utah; and Rush University Medical Center,
Chicago, Illinois). Except for dose recommendations, each
study group was treated identically (with genotypes con-
cealed in both groups).
A dose deviation was defined as a prescribed warfarin
dose on days 1 through 11 of therapy that differed from the
web application recommendation by 1.0 mg/d or greater (for
doses >3 mg/d) or 0.5 mg/d or greater (for doses ≤3.0 mg/d).
After day 11 of therapy, clinicians were free to continue the
recommended warfarin dose or change it, depending on
subsequent INR measures. Study participants underwent
diagnostic testing in the event of signs or symptoms of deep
vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism.
Participants who did not have a symptomatic venous
thromboembolism (VTE) underwent bilateral duplex ultra-
sound screening approximately 1 month after arthroplasty.
Ultrasonography was conducted and the ultrasounds were
read by study personnel who were blinded to study group
assignment.
Genotype-Guided Dosing of Warfarin
Warfarin dosing during the first 11 days of therapy was
guided by a web application (WarfarinDosing.org;
FDA investigational device exemption No. G100317) that
incorporated clinical variables for all patients and also in-
corporated SNPs in VKORC1 (GenBank accession num-
ber AY587020), CYP2C9 (GenBank accession number
AY702706), and CYP4F23,17,18 (GenBank accession number
Key Points
Question Does genotype-guided dosing of warfarin prevent
adverse events?
Findings In this multicenter randomized clinical trial that included
1650 patients undergoing elective hip or knee arthroplasty,
genotype-guided warfarin dosing compared with clinically guided
warfarin dosing reduced the rate of a composite of major bleeding,
international normalized ratio of 4 or greater, venous
thromboembolism, or death from 14.7% to 10.8%.
Meaning Genotype-guided dosing may improve the safety
of warfarin initiation among patients undergoing hip
or knee arthroplasty.

ing algorithms.16,19-21 SNPs in CYP2C9 determine S-warfarin
metabolism17; VKORC1, warfarin sensitivity3; and CYP4F2,
vitamin K metabolism.18,22
Blood for genotyping and archiving was obtained when it
was drawn for the preoperative laboratory tests. Extraction of
DNA from deidentified blood samples collected in EDTA
tubes was performed to determine genotype for VKORC1*2
(-1639G>A, Short Genetic Variations database [dbSNP]
rs9923231), CYP2C9*2 (430C>T, dbSNP rs1799853), CYP2C9*3
(1075A>C, dbSNP rs1057910), and CYP4F2*3 (V433M,
1297G>A, dbSNP rs2108622). Three clinical sites (Washington
University in St Louis, University of Utah, and Intermountain
Healthcare) performed local preoperative genotyping using
GenMarkDx (formerly Osmetech) eSensor instrument and
reagents, and using laboratory-developed real-time poly-
merase chain reaction methods (CYP4F2 only).
The central laboratory at Washington University in
St Louis used the same methods to perform preoperative
genotyping for the other 3 clinical sites (Hospital for Special
Surgery, Rush University Medical Center, and University of
Texas Southwestern). Once per month, the central labora-
tory also performed independent confirmatory genotyping
using pyrosequencing or real-time polymerase chain reac-
tion methods. Based on a trivial genotyping error rate (1 of
5689 SNPs), duplicate genotyping was discontinued in
November 2013; thereafter, the central laboratory per-
formed preoperative genotyping using the GenMarkDx plat-
form for all sites.
Outcomes
The primary outcome of the study was a composite of
the following adverse events: major bleeding within 30 days,
INR of 4 or greater within 30 days, death within 30 days, and
symptomatic or asymptomatic VTE confirmed by objective
testing within 60 days of arthroplasty. Major bleeding was
defined as (1) bleeding into a critical area (intracranial, epi-
dural, intraocular, pericardial, or retroperitoneal), (2) overt
bleeding that resulted in death, (3) a hematoma requiring a
return to the operating room, (4) a decrease in hemoglobin
level of 2 g/dL or greater, (5) a transfusion of 2 or more units
of blood, or (6) hemodynamic changes requiring a transfu-
sion of 1 or more units of blood. Bleeding that did not meet
the major bleeding definition was further subclassified as
nonmajor clinically relevant bleeding or minor bleeding that
was not significant using the definition from prior antico-
agulant trials.7,23,24
Secondary outcomes were (1) adverse events; (2) the
therapeutic warfarin dose; (3) INR control reported as the
percentage of time in the therapeutic range (PTTR) calculated
using linear interpolation25; and (4) 90-day follow-up
for the composite outcomes. When calculating the PTTR,
an INR was considered in the target range if it was within
the range of 2.0 to 3.0 for patients with a target INR of 2.5
and within the range of 1.5 to 2.1 for patients with a target
INR of 1.8.15 The same INR ranges were used when calculat-
ing the time to reach a therapeutic INR, which required that
the subsequent INR (if any) measured at 1 week or longer also
was within this target range without an intervening non-
therapeutic INR. When 2 INR values were obtained on the
same day, the mean was used.
Statistical Analyses
The study was analyzed on a modified intention-to-treat basis
and included all randomized participants who received 1 or
more doses of warfarin. In addition, we prespecified an analy-
sis of the primary end point among patients in the high-risk
subgroupwhoseclinicallyguidedvsgenotype-predicteddoses
differedby1.0mg/dorgreater(accordingtobaselinegenotype-
and clinically guided algorithms16).
To preserve a type I error rate of 5%, we partitioned the α
value between the entire study population and the high-risk
subgroup. Because the primary end points in the 2 groups
were collinear, we used simulation to determine possible
pairs of α values that preserved the overall type I error.26 We
selected an α value of .044 a priori for the primary outcome
in the whole study population and an α value of .01 in the
high-risk subgroup. We used an α value of .05 for other sta-
tistical testing.
To provide adequate power to detect a relative rate (RR)
of 0.68 for the composite end point, we selected a sample size
of 1600 participants. The RR estimate of 0.68 was selected
based on a meta-analysis of clinical trials27 and a large obser-
vational study.28
The primary outcome was analyzed using the χ2 test and
confirmed using a generalized linear mixed model with site as
a random effect. We calculated the rates (including for the post
hoc analyses) by dividing the number of events by the total
number of patients. We calculated the 95% CI for the abso-
lute difference in rates using the method of Newcombe.29
Secondary analyses of rare events (expected frequency
≤5) were analyzed using the Fisher exact test and after add-
ing 0.5 as a continuity correction. We used logistic regression
to test for an interaction between study group and these cat-
egories selected a priori: high-risk subgroup, black race, tar-
get INR of 1.8 vs 2.5, and CYP2C9 genotype. In the test of
CYP2C9 genotype, we assigned 1 point for each CYP2C9*2
allele and 2 points for each CYP2C9*3 allele based on their
effect on S-warfarin clearance.
We compared PTTR using an unpaired t test. Linear re-
gression was used to test for an interaction between PTTR and
target INR. For time to event analyses, we censored partici-
pants at the time of withdraw or loss to follow-up or 30 days
after arthroplasty (whichever came first). For the time to thera-
peutic INR analysis, patients who had fewer than 24 days of
INR monitoring were censored on the day of their last mea-
sured INR.
We compared the number of days until an INR ex-
ceeded the target INR by 1.5 using the log-rank test and
the Cox proportional hazards model. For the Cox models,
we confirmed the proportional hazard assumption by veri-
fying that there was no interaction between predictor vari-
ables and time. All statistical tests were 2-sided. Statistical
analyses were conducted using SAS analytical software ver-
sion 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc) and R version 3.3.1 (R Project for
Statistical Computing).

 Results
Among 1650 patients (mean [SD] age 72.1 [5.4] years; 63.6%
women; and 91.0% white), 831 (50.4%) were randomized to
genotype-guided warfarin dosing and 819 (49.6%) to clini-
cally guided warfarin dosing (eTable 1 in Supplement 2 and
Figure 1). Enrollment began in April 2011 and patients were fol-
lowed up for 90 days; follow-up of the final patient occurred
in October 2016. Twenty-three patients in the genotype-
guided group and 30 in the clinically guided group were ex-
cluded because they did not undergo arthroplasty, withdrew
from the trial, never received warfarin, or were discovered to
have met an exclusion criterion after randomization.
The patients who did not receive the intervention (eTable
1 in Supplement 2) had a higher baseline INR compared with
the included participants (1.03 vs 1.01, respectively) and were
more likely to be smokers (9.4% vs 3.4%), scheduled for hip
arthroplasty (45.3% vs 25.4%), and have a target INR of 2.5
(64.1% vs 49.7%). The final sample consisted of 1597 older par-
ticipants who were predominantly white (91.1%) (Table 1), re-
flecting the arthroplasty population at the participating medi-
calcenters(59.2%ofparticipantswererecruitedattheHospital
for Special Surgery). The genotype distribution was balanced
between the 2 study groups (Table 2).
Primary Outcome
Eighty-seven of 808 participants (10.8%) in the genotype-
guided group and 116 of 789 participants in the clinically
guided group (14.7%) experienced at least 1 composite end
point, corresponding to an absolute risk difference of 3.9%
(95% CI, 0.7% to 7.2%; P = .02). The results for the
genotype-guided dosing group were similar in the mixed
model (P = .02). The rate difference for individual adverse
events was 0.8% (95% CI, –0.2% to 1.8%) for major bleeding,
2.8% (95% CI, 0.1% to 5.6%) for INR of 4 or greater, and
0.7% (95% CI, –1.3% to 2.8%) for VTE (Table 3). None of the
participants died.
The reduction in INR values of 4 or greater occurred after
the first week of warfarin therapy (Figure 2) and did not delay
the time to reach a therapeutic INR (eFigure in Supplement
2). In the high-risk subgroup (n = 658; 41.2% of participants),
the rates of the composite end point in the genotype-guided
group vs the clinically guided group were 11.5% vs 15.2%,
respectively, for an absolute difference of 3.76% (95% CI,
–9.0% to 1.5%, P = .16). The benefit of genotype-guided dos-
ing was consistent in that there was no significant interaction
in any of the subgroups examined (high-risk subgroup,
P = .88; black race, P = .74; CYP2C9 genotype, P = .16; target
INR of 1.8 vs 2.5, P = .70; or hip vs knee arthroplasty, P = .36).
Additional Clinical Outcomes
The rate of either major or nonmajor clinically relevant bleed-
ingwas7.1%(57events)inthegenotype-guidedgroupand9.4%
(74 events) in the clinically guided group for an absolute dif-
ference of 2.3% (95% CI, –0.4% to 5.1%; P = .09). Kaplan-
Meier analysis confirmed that the risk of either major or non-
major clinically relevant bleeding was similar (Figure 3).

 In a post hoc analysis, the rate of symptomatic major ad-
verse events (major bleeding, symptomatic DVT, or pulmo-
nary embolism) was 1.5% (12 events) in the genotype-guided
group and 2.9% (23 events) in the clinically guided group
(between-group difference, 1.4% [95% CI, 0%-3.0%]; P = .051).
Theratesofotheradverseevents(posthocanalyses)weresimi-
lar in the 2 groups (eTable 2 and eFigure in Supplement 2).
Between the primary follow-up and day 90, there was 1
VTE in each group and 1 major bleeding event (an intracranial
hemorrhage 2 months after stopping warfarin) in the clini-
cally guided group. By day 90, the composite outcome (in-
cluding INRs ≥4) had occurred in 90 participants (11.1%) in the
genotype-guidedgroupand119participants(15.1%)intheclini-
cally guided group (between-group difference, 3.9% [95% CI,
0.6%-7.3%]; P = .02). The risk of an INR exceeding the target
INR by 1.5 or greater was not significantly reduced in the geno-
type-guided group compared with the clinically guided group
(hazard ratio, 0.78 [95% CI, 0.59-1.03]; log-rank test, P = .08).

 (95%CI,1.1%-5.8%)fromameanof51.3%withclinicallyguided
warfarin dosing to 54.7% with genotype-guided dosing
(Figure 4 and Figure 5). Genotyping especially benefitted the
high-risk subgroup (P = .006 for interaction) in whom the im-
provement was 7.0% (95% CI, 3.4%-10.6%) from a mean of
48.4% (SD, 23.8%) with clinically guided dosing to 55.3% (SD,
23.4%) with genotype-guided dosing.
The effect of genotype-guided dosing on PTTR was con-
sistent in the 2 target INR groups (P = .053 for interaction) and
among black participants (P = .48 for interaction). Between
days 4 and 14 of warfarin therapy, genotype-guided dosing im-
proved PTTR (absolute gain, 5.7% [95% CI, 2.2%-9.2%];
P = .005).
Protocol Adherence
Genotyping was completed prior to warfarin initiation for all
but 1 patient. There were a total of 1068 dose deviations, rep-
resenting 6.1% of the 17 567 doses recommended by the pro-
tocol. In the genotype-guided dosing group, 306 of 808 pa-
tients (37.9%) had at least 1 dose deviation; in the clinically
guided dosing group, 349 of 789 (44.2%) had at least 1 dose
deviation (P = .009).
One patient was lost to follow-up before the 30-day tele-
phonecall.Sixty-sevenparticipants(36[4.5%]inthegenotype-
guided group and 31 [4.2%] in the clinically guided group) did
not undergo duplex ultrasound screening for DVT and were
assumed to not have DVT.
Discussion
In this randomized clinical trial of warfarin thromboprophy-
laxis after hip and knee arthroplasty, genotype-guided dos-
ing prevented more adverse outcomes than clinically guided
dosing. The absolute reduction in the composite end point

 (3.9%; 95% CI, 0.7%-7.2%) was similar in the predefined high-
risk subgroup (whose clinically vs genotype-predicted doses
differed by ≥1.0 mg/d) and in an analysis extended to 90 days
after arthroplasty.
The reduction in adverse events was likely the result of im-
proved INR control (as quantified by the PTTR), which was
54.7% in the genotype-guided group vs 51.3% in the clinically
guided group. The improvement in PTTR was greatest in the
high-risk subgroup.
Compared with previous studies,7-14 this trial was larger,
used genotype-guided dosing for a longer duration, and in-
corporated more genes into the dosing algorithm. Because the
trial randomized approximately 1600 older patients (aged
≥65 years) undergoing arthroplasty, the effect of genotype-
guided dosing was quantified for clinical outcomes rather than
for PTTR alone.
The trial used genotype-guided dosing for 11 days com-
pared with only 4 or 5 days in the Clarification of Optimal
Anticoagulation through Genetics (COAG) trial7 and in the
EU-PACT8,9 and fewer days in other trials.10-14 The longer pe-
riod of genotype-guided dosing likely prevented cases of su-
pratherapeutic INR that were common in these trials and dur-
ingthesecondweekofwarfarintherapyintheclinicallyguided
dosing group in this trial (Figure 4). Also, unlike prior trials per-
formed at multiple centers,7-9 this trial incorporated the
CYP4F2 (V433M) SNP in the genotype algorithms.
Limitations
This study has several limitations. First, although partici-
pants and study personnel were blinded to study group and
to genotype, the warfarin dose was open label. Therefore,
study personnel may have been able to infer the study group,
particularly in participants who only rarely needed dose
adjustments. However, the warfarin dosing algorithms used
in both of the study groups adjusted for many factors so
dose estimates varied widely among patients in both the

further protection against bias, the end points were adjudi-
cated without knowledge of study group or genotype.
Second,the3.9%absolutereductionintheprimaryoutcome

lated to differences in rates of INR of 4 or greater (Figure 2). The

jorbleeding,symptomaticDVT,orpulmonaryembolism)didnot
achieveindependentstatisticalsignificance(P = .051).Likewise,
the risk of an INR exceeding the target INR by 1.5 or greater was
not significantly reduced during the 90 days of follow-up
(P = .08).Third,inthismulticentertrial,mostparticipantswere

cause most genetic algorithms were derived primarily in popu-
lations composed of other races.7,33
The benefits of genotype-guided dosing also may be re-
duced in patients who need to start warfarin before their
genotype can be obtained. On the other hand, the benefits
of genotype-guided dosing may be greater in clinical settings
when warfarin initiation is dosed empirically rather than being
guided by clinical algorithms.
Despite the requirement for INR monitoring, warfarin con-
tinues to be frequently prescribed because it is orally admin-
istered, inexpensive, and its effects are reversible.34 How-
ever, there are alternatives to warfarin for VTE prophylaxis
following orthopedic surgery. Aspirin is more convenient, al-
beit less effective at preventing VTE.35,36
Newer anticoagulants are effective; however, many phy-
sicians are reluctant to prescribe them due to their cost and
risk of postoperative hemorrhage.37,38 Warfarin also remains
the treatment of choice in patients with kidney failure.
Therefore, strategies that optimize the risks and benefits of
warfarin therapy are important despite the availability
of alternatives.
Widespread use of genotype-guided dosing will depend
on reimbursement, regulations, and logistics. Although sev-
eralcommercialplatformsforwarfarin-relatedgeneshavebeen
approved by the US FDA and the European Medicines Agency,
routine genotyping is not yet recommended.39 The Centers for
Medicare & Medicaid Services used its Coverage with Evi-
dence Development program to fund genotyping in this trial
and will review the results to determine future coverage.
Based on data reflecting clinical care at the time, a 2009
decisionanalysisprojectedthatgenotype-guideddosingwould
cost less than $50 000 per quality-adjusted life-year gained in
the population with chronic atrial fibrillation if it were avail-
able by the second warfarin dose, cost less than $200, and had
an RR for major bleeding events of less than 0.68.27 In this trial,
the RR of 0.24 for major bleeding events (Table 3) had a wide
95% CI of 0.05 to 1.15, so the effect on major bleeding events
is imprecise. In addition to incorporating more SNPs,40
future research could focus on integrating warfarin dosing
algorithms into electronic medical records.
Conclusions
Among patients undergoing elective hip or knee arthroplasty
andtreatedwithperioperativewarfarin,genotype-guidedwar-
farin dosing, compared with clinically guided dosing, re-
duced the combined risk of major bleeding, INR of 4 or greater,
venous thromboembolism, or death. Further research is
needed to determine the cost-effectiveness of personalized
warfarin dosing.
