Body-wide changes in bioenergetics, i.e., energy metabolism, occur in normal aging and disturbed 
bioenergetics may be an important contributing mechanism underlying late-onset Alzheimer’s disease 
(LOAD). We investigated the bioenergetic profiles of fibroblasts from LOAD patients and healthy 
controls, as a function of age and disease. LOAD cells exhibited an impaired mitochondrial metabolic 
potential and an abnormal redox potential, associated with reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide 
metabolism and altered citric acid cycle activity, but not with disease-specific changes in mitochondrial 
mass, production of reactive oxygen species, transmembrane instability, or DNA deletions. LOAD 
fibroblasts demonstrated a shift in energy production to glycolysis, despite an inability to increase 
glucose uptake in response to IGF-1. The increase of glycolysis and the abnormal mitochondrial 
metabolic potential in LOAD appeared to be inherent, as they were disease- and not age-specific. Our 
findings support the hypothesis that impairment in multiple interacting components of bioenergetic 
metabolism may be a key mechanism contributing to the risk and pathophysiology of LOAD.
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is an age-related neurodegenerative disorder characterized by slow progressive 
deterioration and death of neurons. A number of interacting factors determine the risk of AD and among the 
better-studied pathophysiologic pathways, the “amyloid cascade hypothesis” proposes that AD is precipitated by 
an accumulation of Aβ
-containing plaques and tangles of hyperphosphorylated tau (p-tau)1–3. This hypothesis 
is best supported for familial/early-onset forms of AD (EOAD), while less so for the more common sporadic/
late-onset forms (LOAD)4,5. In LOAD, accumulation of toxic Aβ
 and p-tau may not be the initial cause of neural 
degeneration and may instead be consequences of other causative factors5,6. Changes in bioenergetics, i.e., energy 
metabolism, are part of the normal aging process and disturbed bioenergetics may be a contributing mecha-
nism underlying LOAD7–10. These anomalies are body-wide, but affect the brain most substantially because of its 
exceptionally high-energy requirements. Thus, changes of bioenergetics and metabolism could be at the core of 
determining the survival capacities of brain cells with age and under stress, with these processes influenced, in 
turn, by genetic predisposition, epigenetics, environment, and lifestyle.
Bioenergetics is the metabolism of various fuel molecules to produce and utilize energy through glycoly-
sis, mitochondrial respiration, that is, oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos), or the pentose phosphate pathway 
(PPP). Healthy eukaryotic cells produce ATP about 12% through glycolysis and 88% through OxPhos, on aver-
age. In the 1920s, German physician-chemist Otto Warburg discovered that mammalian cancer cells can switch 
from OxPhos to glycolysis when exposed to low oxygen, called the “Warburg effect”11. Unlike proliferating cells, 
post-mitotic neurons have very little ability to use glycolysis, as they lack key enzymes in the glycolytic pathway, 
e.g., there is evidence that neurons have very low levels of 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-biphosphatase 
3 (PFKFB3), a key enzyme in the glycolytic pathway, due to heightened degradation through the ubiquitin pro-
teasome system (UPS)12,13. Thus, neurons don’t ordinarily make adaptive and compensatory shifts to glycolysis, 
including under stress conditions. Instead, they have a high demand for other oxidative substrates and, in par-
ticular, lactate, which is largely provided by proliferating astrocytes through their high glycolytic capacity. While

aging neurons exhibit an “inverse Warburg effect”
, with an increase in OxPhos, probably due to mitochondrial 
damage and inefficiency, astrocytes exhibit a compensatory “Warburg effect” by elevating their glycolysis to pro-
vide and meet the increased neuronal demand for lactate14–18. Accumulating abnormalities in glucose/lactate 
balance in combination with accelerated mitochondrial damage in neurons may be at the core of many cellular 
events in senescence and neurodegeneration, including the initiation and progression of LOAD15.
While the underlying causes of bioenergetic dysfunctions in aging and degenerating cells may be in part 
due to an increase in mitochondrial damage and dysfunction, deficiencies in glucose processing and glycolysis, 
including age-related resistance to insulin signaling, which has been implicated as a mechanism in senescence and 
neurodegeneration, may also contribute10,19. Here, we investigated whether bioenergetic changes occur in cells 
from LOAD patients and how these changes may relate to normal aging. Using a set of skin fibroblast lines, we 
show that LOAD cells have respiratory deficiencies and exhibit a Warburg-type effect that is disease-specific and 
unrelated to age, suggesting that bioenergetic abnormalities may be an inherent mechanism underlying LOAD.
Results
Profiling Bioenergetics with Seahorse Technology. 
Experiments were performed on a total of 30 
skin fibroblast cell lines divided into younger (age 21–54, n = 13) and older controls (age 55–75, n = 7), split 
according to the age range of the LOAD samples (ages 56–82, n = 10) (Supplementary Table 1). To measure 
parameters related to mitochondrial function and glycolysis we first used the Seahorse XFp Cell Mito Stress Test 
(Supplementary Fig. 1). The tests showed that the oxygen consumption rate (OCR), extracellular acidification 
rate (ECAR), and proton production rate (PPR) profiles were increased in LOAD fibroblasts when compared to 
all, young or old, controls (Fig. 1a). Calculated ratios derived from Seahorse XF analyzed values demonstrated a 
significant increase of basal respiration, ATP production, proton leak, maximal respiration, coupling effect, PPR,

and glycolytic capacity in AD samples compared to young or old controls relative to ratios comparing old with 
young controls (Fig. 1b,c). Also, the ratios for non-mitochondrial respiration were increased in AD cells, although 
these differences were not statistically significant. In contrast, the ratios for basal respiration, ATP production, 
proton leak, maximal respiration, non-mitochondrial respiration, coupling effect, PPR, and glycolytic capacity 
appeared to be decreased in old fibroblasts compared to young or LOAD cells. To gain further insight into the 
bioenergetic profiles of our sample population, we additionally conducted a “Cell Energy Phenotype Test” pro-
vided by the Seahorse software. This test evaluates the metabolic potentials for OCR and ECAR by calculating 
changes after stress conditions relative to baseline. The test demonstrated an increase in baseline and stress levels 
for both OCR and ECAR in LOAD cells compared to young or old controls (Fig. 2d). In addition, there was a 
significant increase of the ECAR but no change in the OCR metabolic potential in LOAD cells when compared to 
old fibroblasts. Altogether, these data indicate that AD cells exhibit an increase in glycolysis, and show features of 
heightened mitochondrial activity, but their overall mitochondrial metabolic potential is impaired.
Bioenergetics Parameters Related to Energy Production and Glycolysis. 
The increase of glycolytic 
capacities in LOAD fibroblasts observed in the Seahorse experiments suggests that these cells may have converted 
part of their energy production from OxPhos to glycolysis (Warburg effect). To assess this in more detail, we 
first measured the cells’ actual ATP levels, because the Seahorse assay indirectly measures ATP production by 
inhibiting mitochondrial complex V (see Supplementary Fig. 1). Consistent with the Seahorse-derived data, there 
was an increase of ATP production in LOAD samples when compared to all, young or old, controls (Fig. 2a). We 
then assessed L-Lactate production, as an indicator of glycolytic activity, and found elevated levels of lactate in 
AD fibroblasts compared to control cells (Fig. 2b). Interestingly, both ATP and L-Lactate production were not 
increased in healthy old versus young fibroblasts, indicating that these effects were specific to LOAD, not aging. 
In addition, we performed glucose uptake assays in combination with IGF-1, because IGF-1 promotes uptake of 
glucose and resistance to IGF-1/insulin signaling has been implicated as a factor in AD pathogenesis10,19. Both 
glucose uptake and the effects of IGF-1 were significantly reduced in old and LOAD fibroblast when compared to 
young cells, but were not different between old and LOAD cells (Fig. 2c).
Figure 2. Bioenergetics parameters related to energy production and glycolysis. ATP (a) and L-Lactate (b) 
production were increased in LOAD fibroblasts when compared to controls. Glucose uptake in absence or 
presence of IGF-1 was decreased in LOAD and old fibroblasts when compared to young cells (c). Shown are 
relative values and ratios comparing AD with healthy old and young and healthy old with young samples. Two 
experiments were performed in n = 3 replicates. *P < 0.1; **P < 0.05; ***P < 0.01 (detailed statistical data are 
provided in Supplementary Table 2).

Parameters Related to Mitochondrial Function and Integrity. 
To assess the fibroblasts’ respiratory 
capacities, we investigated several parameters related to mitochondrial function and integrity. The mitochondrial 
redox potential was determined through the levels of total nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADt), reduced 
NADH, and oxidized NAD+. There was a reduction of all NAD metabolites in LOAD cells compared to young 
and old controls, but not in old compared to young controls (Fig. 3a–c). In addition, the calculated redox ratios 
(RR), which indirectly measure the relative amounts of oxidized NAD+ to reduced NADH, were slightly increased 
in LOAD fibroblasts when compared to young and healthy old cells, while these ratios were not different in the 
latter two cell populations (Fig. 3d). Measured changes in mitochondrial function could be due to changes in 
mitochondrial mass. We therefore quantified mitochondria by determining DNA copy numbers using a PCR 
that targets mtMinArc20 (see methods for details), the activity of citrate synthase (CS)21, and quantification of 
mitochondria in MitoTracker assays. These assays showed that PCR amplification of mtMinArc DNA, CS activity 
and the relative numbers of mitochondria were decreased in healthy old and LOAD fibroblasts when compared 
to young controls, with more reduction in old than in LOAD cells (Fig. 4a–c). Together these data indicate that 
both old and LOAD fibroblasts have diminished mitochondria mass and that LOAD cells have a defective redox 
potential, which was disease-specific and not a function of age.
In LOAD fibroblasts, the increase in PPR and proton leak in the Seahorse experiments (Fig. 1b,c) are con-
sistent with the observed dysbalance in the redox potential (Fig. 3) and could be indicative of an insufficiently 
functioning mitochondrial electron transfer chain (ETC) due to transmembrane instability, proton leakage, or 
loss of its electrical potential gradient (Δ
ψ
m). We, therefore, analyzed the redistribution of the MitoPT® dye JC-1 
across the mitochondrial inner cell membrane as an indicator of membrane damage and loss of Δ
ψ
m by Flow 
Cytometry (FCM) (Supplementary Fig. 2). The results showed no significant differences in the ratios of green to 
red fluorescent cells between LOAD, healthy old, or young samples, indicating no loss of Δ
ψ
m (Fig. 4d).
In addition to mitochondrial mass, changes in mitochondrial activity could be due to mitochondrial DNA 
deletions. Such deletions and, in particular, a “common” 4977 bp deletion in the mtMajArc of the mitochondrial 
genome, are associated with oxidative stress in normal aging and in LOAD22. To assess if this deletion occurred 
in our fibroblast samples, we employed the same PCR strategy used for detecting mtMinArc, targeting a region of 
the mitochondrial NADH:Ubiquinone Oxidoreductase Core Subunit 4 (MTND4) gene in mtMajArc20. Although 
mtMajArc was less amplified in healthy old and LOAD cells than young controls (Fig. 5a), the ratios of mtMajArc 
over mtMinArc expressions were similar in all samples, indicating no increase in the 4977 deletion in healthy 
old or LOAD cells (Fig. 5b). When we assessed MTND4 expression, we found less expression in LOAD cells 
compared to young and old cells, suggesting diminished transcriptional activity of the MTND4 gene in LOAD 
Figure 3. Bioenergetics parameters related to mitochondrial respiration. Nicotinamide metabolites, including 
NADt (a), NADH (b), and NAD+ (c) were decreased in LOAD samples compared to young and old controls, 
while the RRs (ratios NAD+/NADH) were not different between controls, but slightly increased in LOAD 
fibroblasts compared to all, young, and old control cells (d). Shown are relative values and ratios comparing AD 
with old and young and old with young samples. Two experiments were performed in n = 3 replicates. *P < 0.1; 
**P < 0.05; ***P < 0.01 (detailed statistical data are provided in Supplementary Table 2).

(Fig. 5c). Finally, mitochondrial DNA is highly susceptible to the damaging effects of reactive oxygen species 
(ROS), which have been implicated in causing DNA deletions22–24. In two separate assays we detected slightly 
higher ROS levels in healthy old and LOAD cells when compared to young controls, which were significant in the 
old, but not in the LOAD samples (Fig. 5d,e). These data indicated that ROS production was not disease-specific 
and a function of age.
Gene Expression Profiles Related to Glycolysis, NAD Metabolism, and CAC. 
To gain insight into 
possible mechanisms of increased glycolysis and abnormal redox potential in LOAD cells, we analyzed the expres-
sion of key genes in the glycolytic pathway, NAD metabolism, and the citric acid cycle (CAC). First, we deter-
mined the expression of PFKFB3, which converts fructose-6-phosphate to fructose-2,6-bis-phosphate (F2,6BP), 
an allosteric activator of phospho-fructo-kinase (PFK), which is the rate-limiting enzyme in glycolysis, and lac-
tate dehydrogenase A (LDHA), which converts pyruvate to lactate and NADH to NAD+, and vice versa. Both of 
these molecules have previously been associated with AD25–27. We found that expression of PFKFB3 and LDHA 
were decreased in old controls and LOAD cells when compared to young fibroblasts, but they were increased 
in LOAD compared to healthy old cells (Fig. 6a). We also determined the expression levels of Nicotinamide 
mononucleotide adenylyltransferase 2 (NMNAT2), Nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT), Sirtuin 
1 and 3 (SIRT1, 3), and Poly [ADP-ribose] polymerase 1 (PARP1) (Fig. 6b). These molecules are involved in NAD 
metabolism, specifically in de novo synthesis or recycling and the hydrolysis of NAD+ to Nicotinamide (NAM), 
and they connect metabolic with other pathways in cellular function28. In addition, they have been implicated 
in aging and neurodegeneration, including AD28–31. While we observed no cohort differences in SIRT1 and 3, 
we found a slight downregulation of NAMPT and PARP1 in LOAD fibroblasts when compared to young and 
old control cells. Most strikingly, there was a significant difference of NMNAT2 expression between the ratios 
of LOAD over old controls and old over young controls, with downregulation in the former and upregulation in 
the latter. These data are consistent with our observed decrease of NAD metabolites in LOAD and an increase 
in healthy old cells (see Fig. 3), suggesting that the abnormal redox potential in LOAD may be in part due to a 
reduction in NAD synthesis and recycling.
Figure 4. Parameters related to mitochondria mass and membrane integrity. qPCR experiments amplifying 
a region of the mtMinArc (a), CS (b), and MitoTracker assays (c) showed reduction of mitochondrial DNA 
amplification, CS activity, and mitochondria staining in healthy old and LOAD cells, respectively, versus young 
controls. FCM in combination with the MitoPT® dye JC-1 showed no significant difference in the ratios of red 
and green fluorescent cells between control and LOAD samples indicating no loss of transmembrane electrical 
potential gradient (Δ
ψ
m) (d). The assay measures confirmation changes of the positively charged dye according 
to its localization in the cell, i.e., green fluorescence when accumulating in the cytoplasm and orange/red 
fluorescence when distributing to mitochondria. Orange/red fluorescence is indicative of dye accumulation 
in mitochondria due to an intact Δ
ψ
m, while green fluorescence indicates loss of Δ
ψ
m due to mitochondrial 
damage of the ETC, and proton and pH gradient. Shown are relative values and ratios comparing AD with 
old and young and old with young samples. Two experiments were performed in n = 3 replicates. *P < 0.1; 
**P < 0.05; ***P < 0.01 (detailed statistical data are provided in Supplementary Table 2).

Finally, we analyzed the expression of key genes in CAC that convert NAD+ to NADH, including Isocitrate 
dehydrogenase 3 (IDH3A), oxoglutarate dehydrogenase (OGDH), malate dehydrogenase 2 (MDH2), and its 
cytosolic isoform MDH1 (Fig. 6c). We found a significant upregulation of MDH2 and IDH3A in the ratios of 
LOAD over old or young controls, and a downregulation in old over young samples. Interestingly, the opposite 
was the case for OGDH, whose expression was significantly downregulated in LOAD and upregulated in old 
cells, comparing the ratios of LOAD with old and old with young fibroblasts. In addition, there was slightly more 
expression of MDH1 in LOAD cells compared to young and old controls. These data show that despite the dimin-
ished mitochondrial mass in both healthy old and LOAD cells, expression of CAC key enzymes involved in NAD+ 
reduction were increased, and this was more pronounced in LOAD fibroblasts.
Correlation of Parameters in Bioenergetics and Metabolism with Age and Disease. 
To deter-
mine the relationships of energy production, glycolysis, and mitochondrial function between LOAD, healthy 
old and young fibroblasts, we conducted a series of correlation analyses (Fig. 7a–c). The levels of overall energy 
production (ATP) strongly correlated positively with metabolic parameters in LOAD and young fibroblasts when 
compared to old cells, and were more strongly associated with glucose uptake and IGF-1 signaling in LOAD or 
healthy old than in young cells (Fig. 7a). As for the metabolites related to mitochondrial redox potential, they 
strongly correlated negatively with mitochondrial function and integrity in LOAD cells, consistent with an ineffi-
ciently functioning ETC and an abnormal RR. In addition, mitochondrial mass and DNA damage positively cor-
related with parameters of mitochondrial function and integrity, and negatively with ROS production in LOAD 
cells.
As for gene expression profiles, PFKFB3 and LDHA had strong positive correlations with glucose uptake 
in the absence or presence of IGF-1, but predominant negative correlations with glycolysis, ATP and lactate 
production in both LOAD and healthy old cells (Fig. 7b). For molecules related to NAD synthesis, recycling, 
and metabolism, the expression of NMNAT2, NAMPT, PARP1, and SIRT3, but not SIRT1, had strong positive 
correlations with NADt, NADH, NAD+, and RR levels in LOAD cells, while correlations in\ both old and young 
samples were negative (Fig. 7b), implying a compensatory increase in gene expression as a homeostatic attempt 
to sustain NAD metabolism in LOAD cells. Finally, the analysis of NAD metabolites with the expression of CAC 
enzymes demonstrated strong positive correlations with OGDH in young and LOAD, but not in healthy old cells 
Figure 5. Parameters related to mitochondrial DNA integrity and transcription. qPCR experiments amplifying 
the 4977 “common deletion” within the mtMajArc showed reduced PCR amplification in old and LOAD cells 
(a), but no differences of calculated ratios over mtMinArc amplification (b). Expression of the MTND4 gene 
was decreased in LOAD cells when compared to all, young, and healthy old controls (c). ROS levels measured 
with the OxiSelect (d) or MitoSox (e) assays were slightly increased in LOAD and significantly increased in 
healthy old cells, compared to young controls. Shown are relative values and ratios comparing LOAD with 
old and young and old with young samples. Two experiments were performed in n = 3 replicates. *P < 0.1; 
**P < 0.05; ***P < 0.01 (detailed statistical data are provided in Supplementary Table 2).

(Fig. 7b). Strikingly, there were strong positive correlations with MDH2 expression in all samples, while expres-
sion of cytosolic MDH1 negatively correlated with the NAD metabolites in young and LOAD, and positively 
in healthy old cells. As for RR, its levels correlated strongly positively with IDH3A and negatively with OGDH, 
MDH1, and MDH2 in old cells, while both young and LOAD fibroblasts had positive correlations, except for 
MDH1, which also correlated negatively with RR in LOAD cells. Together, the predominant positive correlations 
of CAC enzyme expression with NAD metabolite or RR levels in LOAD cells could be a reflection of the increased 
RR seen in these cells.
Lastly, we compared the bioenergetics parameters and the results from the gene expression analyses with age 
(Fig. 7c). In all healthy control samples, overall energy production and glycolytic metabolites were diminished 
with age, while mitochondrial respiration increased, despite an increase in ROS production and DNA damage, 
and a reduction in mitochondrial mass. In comparison to young fibroblasts, overall energy production and the 
metabolites from glycolysis and mitochondrial respiration decrease with age in both healthy old and LOAD 
cells, despite an increase in the redox potential and PPR, and an increase in glucose uptake and IGF-1 signaling 
in LOAD cells. Consistently, expression levels of PFKFB3, LDHA, NMNAT2, and SIRT3 increased with age in 
LOAD, but decreased in young and old controls. As for the other NAD-related enzymes, NMNAT2, PARP1, and 
SIRT1 declined with age in all samples. Interestingly, we found an increase of the CAC enzymes IDH3A, OGDH, 
MDH1 with age in LOAD, but a decrease in old and young controls. Finally, a decrease in bioenergetic parameters 
related to mitochondrial mass, integrity and damage seemed to be more pronounced in old than in LOAD cells.
Discussion
There are a number of evidence-based hypotheses as to the cause of AD. Aβ
-containing plaques and tangles of 
p-tau have long been considered the “hallmarks” of AD pathology. However, there is increasing evidence that

in LOAD the accumulation of these toxic molecules may not be the sole or initial cause of the disease and may 
instead be consequences of other causative factors4–6,9,10. LOAD is most likely characterized by a combination 
of several interacting pathological events that are closely related to changes with age and that include, amongst 
others, bioenergetic, metabolic, neurovascular, and inflammatory processes5,6,10. A key determinant of LOAD 
is aging and, in fact, many, if not all, pathological events in LOAD are also part of the normal aging process. 
For example, there is strong evidence that cellular energy metabolism changes with age, and that bioenergetic 
anomalies may trigger processes, such as resistance to growth factor/insulin signaling, neuroinflammation, cell 
membrane changes, and microvascular disease, which all contribute to senescence and age-related neurodegen-
eration, including LOAD7,8,10.
Bioenergetics consists of a multitude of different cellular pathways and processes that include mitochondrial 
respiration and the metabolism of various fuel molecules and their downstream products to produce and uti-
lize energy. A major energy substrate, especially in brain, is glucose, which is metabolized via cytosolic aerobic 
glycolysis to pyruvate or under low oxygen conditions via anaerobic glycolysis to lactate. Under usual oxygen 
levels, pyruvate is processed in the mitochondria through CAC and OxPhos to generate ATP. In addition, gly-
colysis oxidizes the reduced form of NADH to NAD+, which is an important oxidizing agent involved in redox 
reactions and electron transfer. In the mitochondria, OxPhos is coupled to CAC and can metabolize substrates 
from different sources, including carbohydrates (i.e., pyruvate or lactate produced from glycolysis), ketones, fatty 
acids, glutamine, and others. Contrary to glycolysis, OxPhos largely results in the reduction of NAD+ to NADH. 
Mitochondrial energy production depends on oxygen and is highly efficient, producing about 34–36 mol of ATP 
from one mol glucose with CO2 and H2O as waste products. In contrast, both forms of glycolysis generate ATP 
at low efficiency (about two mol per mol of glucose). However, under most conditions aerobic glycolysis can 
produce ATP at a faster rate than OxPhos, and glycolysis is usually increased in growing or stressed cells. A third 
mechanism to metabolize glucose is through PPP, in which glucose-6-phosphate is converted to ribose-5- and 
xylulose-5-phosphate leading to the reduction of NADP+ to NADPH, which pathway is used for fatty acid bio-
synthesis and regeneration of reduced glutathione.
A key bioenergetic factor that has long been suspected in senescence and neurodegeneration is oxidative 
stress, which produces DNA-damaging ROS22,24, and elevated ROS is an early event in AD32. For example, oxi-
dative stress has been implicated in damaging the brain’s vascular endothelium in early stages of AD, leading 
to microvascular disease and blood brain barrier dysfunction as significant contributors to LOAD pathol-
ogy33,34. Oxidative stress is particularly harmful in neurons, because these cells almost entirely rely on OxPhos 
for energy production, due to a paucity of key enzymes in the glycolytic pathway, including PFKFB3, which 
is highly degraded at the UPS due to high activity of the E3 ubiquitin ligase, anaphase-promoting complex/

cyclosome (APC/C)-Cdh1, in neurons12,13. Therefore, neurons can’t efficiently switch from OxPhos to glyco-
lysis (Warburg effect) to meet energy demands, making them especially vulnerable to stress and bioenergetic 
changes. Mitochondrial damage in neurons leads to reduced efficiency and a compensatory increase in OxPhos 
(inverse Warburg effect), and the cells may also abnormally upregulate glycolysis14–18. This could be a conse-
quence of numerous factors, such as mitochondrial dysfunction, possibly through age-associated mitochondrial 
DNA deletions35,36, resistance to growth factor and IGF-1/insulin signaling10,19, and risk factors such as Apoε
4, 
which has been implicated in damaging the oxidative system37–39. In addition, astrocytes increase metabolic rates 
through upregulation of glycolysis (Warburg effect) to produce lactate and support the increased energy demand 
in neurons14–18, which may lead to intracellular molecular changes and astrogliosis, further contributing to AD 
pathology40–42.
The above conceptual outline of a role for dysfunctional bioenergetics in LOAD has not yet been experimen-
tally proven. Studying bioenergetics in human aging and neurodegeneration is difficult, as the availability of 
relevant human material is limited and experimental systems are often hard to interpret due to high inter-subject 
variability, insufficiencies of model systems that mimic the human condition, species-specific biology, and other 
complicating factors, including limits of technology for studying live brains. The goal of our study was to deter-
mine if bioenergetic changes occur in cells from LOAD patients and how changes may relate to normal aging. 
Age related changes occur throughout the body, and factors underlying LOAD may be studied in brain as well 
as peripheral cells, including primary skin fibroblasts, which have been used in many studies as model system 
to investigate cell functions in context of genetic predisposition, e.g., familial forms of AD, cellular toxins, ther-
apeutic drugs, or as a diagnostic tool. However, to our knowledge, there has been no published investigation 
that comprehensively assessed and compared the bioenergetics profiles in unmodified naïve LOAD and healthy 
control fibroblasts, as a function of age and disease. Our data reveal that LOAD cells have an overall increase in 
basal and respiratory consumption, but an impairment of their mitochondrial metabolic potential, which was 
associated with a decrease in NAD metabolites and altered CAC activity, but not with a disease-specific reduc-
tion of mitochondria mass, transmembrane instability, ROS production, or mitochondrial DNA deletions. The 
observed changes in mitochondrial function in LOAD cells could be related to altered gene expression profiles, 
including decreased expression of MTND4 and key molecules involved in NAD synthesis, recycling, or metab-
olism, and upregulation of enzymes in the CAC. In addition, LOAD cells shift their energy production to glyco-
lysis resulting in augmented ATP and lactate production. The increase in glycolytic activity occurs in spite of an 
inability to augment glucose uptake in response to IGF-1. Heightened glycolysis in combination with a decreased 
mitochondrial metabolic potential and a defective redox potential in LOAD fibroblasts appears to be disease- and 
not age-specific features, while the inability to increase glucose uptake in response to IGF-1 signaling is a charac-
teristic of both healthy old and LOAD cells. A schematic summary of these results is provided in Fig. 8.
These findings have several implications for understanding the role of bioenergetic changes in LOAD pathol-
ogy and aging. First, the increase of glycolysis with an upregulation of glycolytic enzymes and augmented ATP 
and lactate production, together with an age-associated increase in glucose uptake, IGF-1 signaling, and PFKFB3 
and LDHA gene expression in LOAD cells could be a compensatory mechanism to meet heightened substrate 
demand in the face of failing mitochondrial ability to sustain overall energy production, as indicated by their 
diminished mitochondrial metabolic potential and a reduction in NAD metabolism. The increase of glycolysis, 
however, is not associated with an overall increase in glucose supply, because, as in fibroblasts from healthy older 
subjects, overall glucose uptake and the response to IGF-1 signaling are impaired in LOAD cells. These data sup-
port the hypothesis that resistance to IGF-1/insulin-signaling is associated with age per se, as it is seen in both 
aging and AD pathology10,19, and also suggest that in LOAD upregulation of glycolysis may be an independent 
mechanism that is unrelated to insulin/IGF-1 resistance. Second, the impaired dynamic mitochondrial metabolic 
potential and the overall increase in basal and oxidative consumption in LOAD cells could be an expression of 
decreased NAD metabolism, increased CAC activity, and an abnormally elevated RR - the redox potential - which 
reflects the cellular reducing potential and whose disturbance can be an indicator of oxidative stress or imbalance. 
Specifically, the reduction of tNAD, NAD+ and NADH could be a consequence of the observed decrease in the 
expression of key molecules in NAD synthesis, recycling, or metabolism, and, in particular NMNAT2, which acts 
on converting both de novo synthesized nicotinate mononucleotide (NAMN) and recycled nicotinamide mon-
onucleotide (NMN) to nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide (NADD) (see Fig. 8). In addition, other parameters 
likely contribute to a disturbed mitochondrial metabolic and redox potential, including the diminished expres-
sion of MTND4, a defective ETC, as suggested by the increase in proton leak and PPR, and the observed increase 
in CS activity relative to old cells, and alterations in the expression of the CAC molecules IDH3A, OGDH, and 
MDH2 that are involved in reducing NAD+ to NADH. Finally, as the ratio of the redox pair NAD+/NADH is 
tightly linked to both the activity of the glycolytic pathway and OxPhos, the relative increase in the RR could 
be a consequence of the observed altered prominence of these processes, and of damaged mitochondria. There 
is evidence that NAD+ inhibits the production of and protects against the damaging effects of ROS43,44, which 
have been implicated in AD pathogenesis22,24. Overall ROS levels were slightly elevated in both healthy old or 
LOAD cells, but there was no increase in the 4977 “common” DNA deletion, indicating that changes in ROS are 
age-associated, and mitochondrial DNA damage through ROS is not a major factor in either aging or LOAD 
fibroblasts. Third, in terms of overall energy (ATP) production, LOAD fibroblasts were more closely related to 
young than old control cells, in particular, as indicated by their heightened glycolytic activity. In contrast, mito-
chondrial mass and their overall integrity in LOAD seemed to reflect more the profiles of those in old cells. A key 
difference between healthy old and LOAD cells, however, appears to be a defective ETC and RR, and dysbalances 
in the synthesis, recycling, and use of NAD metabolites, their utilization in the CAC, and their correlations to the 
bioenergetic profiles in general, as well as to their age-associations. This unique metabolic profile of LOAD fibro-
blasts may be the reason for their less efficiently functioning respiration and their compensatory upregulation of 
glycolysis.

Taken together, our data are partially consistent with an earlier report documenting increased glycolysis and 
a decrease in oxidative metabolism in skin fibroblasts from AD patients45. They are also consistent with several 
cellular features that have been associated with LOAD in general, including oxidative stress, diminished mito-
chondrial potential, defective or reduced mitochondria, and IGF-1/insulin resistance, but don’t support other 
characteristics, such as mitochondrial DNA deletion and increased ROS production (reviewed in5–7,10,46). It 
should be kept in mind that skin fibroblasts are not the primary cell type that is affected in LOAD and that changes 
in cell function are most likely partly cell-specific. In addition, as discussed above, the pathogenesis of LOAD is 
probably multifactorial with bioenergetics being one part of risk determination. Although our study does not 
provide a causative mechanism on how these metabolic changes arise or interact to drive disease pathogenesis, 
the current results suggest potential targets to study. Specifically, our data reveal that LOAD fibroblasts appear 
to exhibit a Warburg-type effect that is disease-specific and unrelated to age. Although it needs to be determined 
if this feature also applies to AD-relevant cell types, such as neurons and astrocytes, our findings could support 
the “Warburg/inverse Warburg” hypothesis, in that brain cells in LOAD may upregulate OxPhos and glycolysis 
due to a reduction of the mitochondrial metabolic potential, damage, or death, resulting in bioenergetic dysbal-
ances. While upregulation of glycolysis may be beneficial in astrocytes to sustain heightened energy production, 
it may be detrimental in neurons, because downregulation of glycolytic activity through APC/C-Cdh1 mediated 
regulation of PFKFB3 levels protects these cells against oxidation, and upregulation of the glycolytic pathway 
causes oxidative stress and apoptosis13. In addition, while PFKFB3 promotes cell cycle and is anti-apoptotic in 
proliferating cells47, such induction of the cell cycle machinery in postmitotic neurons would have the opposite 
effect leading to apoptotic cell death. Finally, bioenergetics dysbalances may be inherent characteristics in LOAD, 
and in combination with other factors may contribute to its pathology. And, these defects may be system wide, 
due to underlying genomic and environmental factors, but have more evident consequences in brain, with its high 
energy-requirements.
Methods
Subjects and Cell Lines. 
Subjects (Supplementary Table 1) were recruited at the McLean Hospital Memory 
Diagnostic Clinic and diagnosed by a geriatric psychiatrist using the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental 
Figure 8. Schematic summary of bioenergetic changes in LOAD and old control fibroblasts. Parameters related 
to mitochondrial function, mass, integrity, OxPhos, and NAD metabolism are in the blue area and those related 
to glycolysis in the green area. Arrows indicate up-regulation, down-regulation, or no changes in parameters for 
LOAD relative to young or old controls, and old relative to young controls. While alterations in glucose uptake, 
IGF-1 signaling, mitochondrial mass, ROS production, DNA deletion, and membrane stability follow similar 
patterns in healthy old and LOAD cells, changes in glycolysis, NAD metabolism, CAC activity, expression of 
MTND4, proton leak, and respiratory potential appear to be more specific to either LOAD or aging. See text

Seahorse XFp Cell Mito Stress Test. 
Seahorse XFp Cell Mito Stress Tests (Seahorse, Agilent Technologies, 
Santa Clara, CA) (Supplementary Fig. 1) were performed according to the manufacturer’s protocol on an XFp 
instrument. Two days prior assay, Seahorse culture plates were coated with 16.7 µl/ml Matrigel in DMEM/F12 
media (Corning, Corning, NY) for 2 hrs at 37 °C and stored at 4 °C. One day prior assay, 10,000 fibroblasts per 
well were plated and cultured in MEM15 media overnight. At day of assay, XF assay medium was supplemented 
with 10 mM glucose, 1 mM pyruvate, and 2 mM glutamine, and the pH adjusted to 7.4. After assay performance, 
cells were stained with CyQuant solution (Life Technologies - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Carlsbad, CA) diluted in 
XF assay medium and incubated for 1 hr in 37 °C. Green fluorescence (excitation: 485/20, emission: 528/20) was

MitoPT JC-1 Assay. 
The mitoPT JC-1 assay (ImmunoChemistry Technologies, Bloomington, MN) using 
the slow, lipophilic, cationic fluorescent dye 5,5′
,6,6′
-tetrachloro-1,1′
,3,3′
 tetraethylbenzimidazolocarbocyanine 
iodide (JC-1)50 was performed in combination with FCM on a BD Accuri C6 Flow Cytometer (BD Biosciences, 
San Jose, CA) according to protocols provided by the manufacturer. The gating strategy and the use of controls 
are presented in Supplementary Fig. 2.
Preparation of Nucleic Acids and Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). 
Cells were harvested, placed 
in 0.5 ml TRIzol Reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and stored at −
80 °C. 100 µl chloroform was added, the 
samples centrifuged, and the RNA-containing aqueous phase collected, mixed with an equal amount of 75% 
ethanol and RNA was purified using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) including DNase digestion 
with RNase-free DNase I (Quiagen) for 15 min. DNA was extracted from the same samples by adding 150 µl 
100% ethanol to the organic interphase, incubation at room temperature (RT) for 3 min, and centrifugation. The 
phenol/ethanol supernatant was removed and the DNA washed in 0.5 ml 0.1 M sodium citrate solution, incubated 
for 30 min at RT and centrifuged. The DNA was resuspended in 0.5 ml 75% ethanol, incubated for 10 min at RT, 
centrifuged, dried for 5 min, and dissolved in 8 mM NaOH.
Quantitative (q)PCR was performed with primers amplifying a region in the genomic mitochondrial minor 
arc (mtMinArc) or targeting the MTND4 gene located in the major arc (mtMajArc) together with primers 
targeting a region within the single-copy human genomic β
2-microglobulin gene (B2M) as described20. PCR 
was conducted on a BioRad CFX Connect PCR cycler (BioRad) using probe-based multiplex TaqMan qPCR 
assays (Applied Biosystems, Waltham, Massachusetts) labeling the mtMinArc and mtMajArc probes with FAM, 
and the human B2M gene probe with VIC. 50 ng of template DNA was used in 20 μ
l reactions containing 10 μ
l 
TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix, 50 nM mtMin/Arc or mtMaj/Arc primers together with 500 nM B2M prim-
ers and 250 nM TaqMan Probes (Applied Biosystems). The settings for the cycler were as follows: 10 min 95 °C, 
followed by 50 repeats of 15 sec 95 °C, 15 sec 55 °C, 1 min 60 °C. For detecting mRNA transcripts, 2 µg of puri-
fied RNA was treated with 2 µl DNAse I buffer and 1 µl rDNAse I (Ambion, Carlsbad, CA), incubated at 37 °C 
for 30 min, resuspended in 2 µl DNAse Inactivation Reagent, incubated at RT for 2 min, and centrifuged. The 
RNA-containing supernatants were collected and assessed for remaining mitochondrial DNA contamination 
in 20 µl PCR reactions containing 50 nM mtMinArc primers, iTaq Universal SYBR Green Supermix (BioRad) 
using the cycler settings as described above. For qPCR, 1 to 2 µg of total RNA was converted to cDNA using the 
High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription (Applied Biosystems) in 20 µl per reactions according to the protocol

provided by the manufacturer. cDNA was then diluted 1:10 and qPCR performed with 50 nM published primers 
(see Supplementary Material) in PCR reactions using Taq Universal SYBR Green Supermix, and the following 
settings: genomic PCR according to20 using 50 cycles, and cDNA PCR at 95 °C/15 sec followed by 50 cycles at 
95 °C/15 sec, 60 °C/1 min, and 72 °C/30 sec. PCR data were analyzed using the 2−Δ
CT method51 to normalize 
mitochondrial genomic mtMinArc and mtMajArc, and MTND4 against B2M, and the other transcripts against 
β
-Actin (BACT). To calculate relative levels of mtMajArc DNA normalized values were used in the following 
formula: (mtMinArc-mtMajArc)/mtMinArc.
Statistical analysis. 
Data were plotted as mean +/−
 standard error of the mean (SEM) from 2 independent 
experiments performed in triplicates (n = 3), unless otherwise stated. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) 
tests for independent measures were performed using the Social Science Statistics software (http://www.socscista-
tistics.com/Default.aspx). Differences of comparison were considered statistically significant when P-values were 
less than 0.05 (P < 0.05), while P-values between 0.05 and 0.1 were considered trend data. Detailed statistical data 
can be found in Supplementary Table 2.
