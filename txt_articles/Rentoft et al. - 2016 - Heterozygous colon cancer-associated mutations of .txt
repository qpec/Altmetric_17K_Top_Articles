Even small variations in dNTP concentrations decrease DNA replication
fidelity, and this observation prompted us to analyze genomic cancer
data for mutations in enzymes involved in dNTP metabolism. We found
that sterile alpha motif and histidine-aspartate domain-containing
protein 1 (SAMHD1), a deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate triphospho-
hydrolase that decreases dNTP pools, is frequently mutated in colon
cancers, that these mutations negatively affect SAMHD1 activity, and
that several SAMHD1 mutations are found in tumors with defective
mismatch repair. We show that minor changes in dNTP pools in com-
bination with inactivated mismatch repair dramatically increase mu-
tation rates. Determination of dNTP pools in mouse embryos revealed
that inactivation of one SAMHD1 allele is sufficient to elevate
dNTP pools. These observations suggest that heterozygous cancer-
associated SAMHD1 mutations increase mutation rates in cancer cells.
dNTP pools | colon cancer | DNA replication fidelity
R
ecent advances in whole-genome sequencing have revealed
that human cancers often contain thousands of subclonal
mutations (1–3), lending support to the mutator phenotype hy-
pothesis that postulates that an elevation in spontaneous mutation
rate is an early step in cancer evolution (4, 5). The three major
determinants of DNA replication fidelity that control the spon-
taneous mutation rate are nucleotide selectivity by DNA poly-
merases, proofreading by replicative DNA polymerases, and the
mismatch repair (MMR) system (6). Failures in the two latter
determinants have now been firmly associated with the develop-
ment of cancer (7), but they cannot account for the increased
spontaneous mutation rates in most cancers (5).
The first determinant, nucleotide selectivity by DNA polymer-
ases, can be affected by changes in the absolute and relative con-
centrations of the four deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs).
We have previously demonstrated that severely imbalanced dNTP
pools strongly decrease DNA replication fidelity in Saccharomyces
cerevisiae (8, 9) without affecting cell proliferation, as long as none
of the dNTPs is limiting for DNA replication (10). An equimolar
elevation in dNTP pools also decreases DNA replication fidelity,
both in yeast and bacteria, presumably by suppressing the proof-
reading activity of replicative DNA polymerases and by stimulating
lesion bypass by both replicative and translesion DNA polymerases
(11–16). Recently, we showed in yeast that even a small elevation of
the dNTP pool dramatically decreases the replication fidelity of
exonuclease-deficient DNA polymerase e (Pol e) and DNA poly-
merase δ (Pol δ) harboring the cancer-associated R696W mutation
(17–19). Based on these observations, we hypothesized that de-
creased nucleotide selectivity caused by changes in the absolute or
relative concentrations of dNTPs could be one of the reasons for
the increased mutation rates in cancers.
The absolute and relative concentrations of dNTPs are con-
trolled by several dozen proteins (20), and mutations or a change
in abundance in any of these could in principle result in a dis-
tortion of the dNTP pool. Ribonucleotide reductase (RNR),
dCMP deaminase, dUTPase, dTMP synthase, dTMP kinase, and
NDP kinases control dNTP biosynthesis. Purine and pyrimidine
de novo synthesis pathways provide substrates for RNR, and
multiple (deoxy)nucleoside kinases and 5′ nucleotidases control
cellular and mitochondrial dNTP salvage. We analyzed the
mutation status of the genes involved in dNTP metabolism in
colon cancers using a public dataset from The Cancer Genome
Atlas (TCGA) and identified SAMHD1 (sterile alpha motif and
histidine-aspartate domain-containing protein 1) as one of the
frequently mutated genes.
SAMHD1 is a dual-function enzyme with both nuclease and
deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate triphosphohydrolase (dNTPase)
activities (21, 22). Germ-line mutations in SAMHD1 have been as-
sociated with Aicardi–Goutieres syndrome, a congenital autoim-
mune disease (23), and more recently SAMHD1 was shown to be an
HIV-1 restriction factor operating in nondividing blood cells (24, 25).
Initially, the restriction function of SAMHD1 was attributed to its
dNTPase activity, which was presumed to decrease the intracellular
dNTP concentrations to levels incompatible with viral replication
(26). Later, it was suggested that restriction of HIV-1 was primarily
caused by the nuclease activity of SAMHD1 degrading viral
RNA (27). However, more recently it was proposed that SAMHD1
lacks nuclease activity altogether and that the restriction of HIV-1 is
caused by alternating ssRNA-binding and dNTPase activities (28).
Franzolin et al. showed that SAMHD1 is expressed in a cell cycle-
regulated manner and that loss of SAMHD1 has large effects on
dNTP pool composition in vitro in both quiescent and cycling cells
(29). SAMHD1 has also been identified as a potential driver gene
in chronic lymphatic leukemia, where it is recurrently mutated in
early stages of tumor development (30–32). In solid tumors, lower
Significance
The three major DNA replication fidelity determinants are nucle-
otide selectivity, proofreading, and mismatch repair. Defects in
the two latter determinants are now firmly associated with can-
cer. Nucleotide selectivity is affected by changes in the absolute or
relative concentrations of dNTPs. Here, we show that hemizygous
SAMHD1+/− mouse embryos have increased dNTP pools com-
pared with wild-type controls and that heterozygous mutations
that inactivate SAMHD1 are frequently found in colon cancers.
We infer that such cancer cells have increased dNTP pools and,
therefore, higher mutation rates. These observations suggest that
changes in dNTP concentrations, which affect nucleotide selec-
tivity, the first major determinant of DNA replication fidelity, are
associated with cancer.

 protein and RNA expression of SAMHD1 has been observed,
presumably caused by promoter methylations (30, 33, 34). However,
it is unknown whether SAMHD1 somatic mutations found in can-
cers affect its dNTPase activity (35).
Here, we show that colon cancer-associated mutations in
SAMHD1 either abolish its dNTPase activity or change its speci-
ficity, leading to unequal degradation of individual dNTPs. Im-
portantly, even a hemizygous deletion of SAMHD1 leads to an
increase of dNTP pools in mouse embryos, which, similar to tu-
mors, contain actively dividing cells. This result suggests that,
although the SAMHD1 mutations identified in cancers are het-
erozygous, they would still result in an alteration of dNTP pools.
Interestingly, several of the identified SAMHD1 mutations were
present in MMR-deficient hypermutated cancers. Analysis of
MMR-deficient yeast strains and human colorectal carcinoma cells
demonstrated that even a small alteration of dNTP pools results in a
multiplicative increase of mutation rates. Together, these findings
suggest that mutations affecting the activity of SAMHD1 are likely
to result in increased mutation rates in cancer.
Results
SAMHD1 Is Frequently Mutated in Colon Cancer. Mutations in
SAMHD1 have previously been associated with chronic lymphatic
leukemia, in which SAMHD1 has been suggested to be one of the
driver genes, but its role in solid cancers is uncertain (30–32). The
Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer (COSMIC) currently
contains 104 SAMHD1 mutations (36), and a quarter of these
mutations were found in tumors of the large intestine (26 muta-
tions in 24 samples). With the exception of one 31-nucleotide
deletion, all SAMHD1 mutations in tumors of the large intestine
were single-nucleotide polymorphisms (Table S1). The majority
of the mutations were predicted to be deleterious by using in silico
analysis: 87% were predicted to be damaging by at least one
of four computational tools (Grantham, SIFT, PolyPhen2, and
CADD), 72% by two or more tools, and 50% by three tools (Table
S1) (37–40). Four of the mutations (R145, D207, R366, and R451)
are located at amino acid residues that have been reported to have
functional significance in in vitro studies (27, 41, 42).
Eight of the 26 SAMHD1 mutations (Table S1) were found in the
publicly available colorectal cancer (CRC) TCGA dataset,
hgsc.bcm.edu COAD.IlluminaGA DNASeq.Level 2.1.5.0, which
was downloaded for further analysis. The dataset contained 114,594
mutations in 217 tumors; thus, 3.7% (8 of 217) of the tumors in this
CRC dataset carried a coding mutation in SAMHD1. Approxi-
mately 20% of the 217 tumors were hypermutated (>12 mutations
per 106 bases) (43), and the eight SAMHD1 mutations (Table S1)
were found in these hypermutated tumors. Analysis of the dataset
using the Significantly Mutated Genes (SMG) test from the MuSIC
suite (44) showed that—when taking into consideration mutation
type and gene length—SAMHD1 carried more mutations than
expected by chance (P = 0.049, false discovery rate = 0.05,
convolution test).
Of the total number of mutations falling within coding regions of
all genes in the CRC dataset, 39% were silent, whereas none of the
eight mutations in SAMHD1 were silent. Among the 26 SAMHD1
mutations in the current COSMIC database, only 2 (8%) were si-
lent mutations. An increase in the ratio between nonsilent and si-
lent mutations in a gene can indicate that functional mutations
within that gene are beneficial for the tumor and are selected for
during cancer development. Analysis of a panel of genes of known
genetic importance in colon cancer (APC, BRAF, KRAS, PIK3CA,
SMAD4, and TP53) (45, 46) also showed a lower frequency of silent
mutations (3.4%) compared with the overall frequency of silent
mutations (39%).
Collectively, these data indicate that SAMHD1 mutations in
colon cancer occur nonrandomly and affect functionally impor-
tant residues, suggesting that deleterious mutations in this gene
can be beneficial for the tumors.
CRC-Specific Mutations Negatively Affect SAMHD1 dNTPase Activity.
To investigate the effect of the CRC-specific amino acid sub-
stitutions on SAMHD1 dNTPase activity, we chose four muta-
tions (V133I, A338T, R366H, and D497Y) for recombinant
protein purification and characterization (Fig. S1). V133I was
selected because two tumors carried this mutation, but it was
unclear from the in silico analysis to what extent V133I would
affect the activity of SAMHD1. The other three mutations were
predicted to be deleterious, and we wanted to confirm this
prediction biochemically.
To measure the dNTPase activity, we quantified the deoxy-
ribonucleoside production derived from the hydrolysis of dNTPs by
the wild-type (WT) SAMHD1 protein and the four mutants over a
time course of 60 min (Fig. S2). Compared with WT, all mutants
had reduced specific dNTPase activity toward all four dNTPs (Fig.
1). Interestingly, whereas the D497Y mutation nearly abolished the
dNTPase activity, other mutations had varying effects on SAMHD1
activity toward the individual dNTPs. For example, there was a
ninefold difference between deoxyadenosine and deoxyguanosine
production by the R366H variant of SAMHD1 (Fig. 1D). These
data suggest that SAMHD1 mutations might result in imbalanced
dNTP pools.
Hemizygous SAMHD1 Deletion Leads to Elevated dNTP Pools in Mouse
Embryos. All eight identified CRC-associated SAMHD1 muta-
tions from the TCGA dataset were heterozygous, and the cor-
responding methylation data from the TCGA database did not
show any SAMHD1 promoter methylation that might indicate
inactivation of the WT allele. Thus, although the four tested
mutations—V133I, A338T, R366H, and D497Y—negatively af-
fected SAMHD1 dNTPase activity in vitro, it was not clear
whether these heterozygous mutations would have any effect on
dNTP pools in vivo. To address this question, we compared dNTP
pools in WT, SAMHD1+/− hemizygous, and SAMHD1−/− ho-
mozygous embryonic day 13.5 (E13.5) mouse embryos. We chose

 whole embryos because they contain a large number of actively
dividing cells, similar to actively proliferating solid tumors. As
expected, dNTP pools were significantly increased in homozygous
SAMHD1−/− embryos. Importantly, hemizygous SAMHD1+/−
embryos also had elevated and imbalanced dNTP pools compared
with WT, and dCTP and dTTP were increased by ∼40%, dATP by
∼60%, and dGTP by ∼20% (Fig. 2). These data strongly suggest
that CRC-associated heterozygous SAMHD1 mutations that
negatively affect its dNTPase activity in vitro should result in an
elevation of dNTP pools in vivo.
Small Alteration of dNTP Pools Dramatically Increases Mutation Rates
in Combination with MMR Deficiency. Further analysis of the eight
tumors with mutated SAMHD1 showed that six of them had de-
fects in MMR (Table 1 and Fig. S3). To model the effect of minor
dNTP pool increases on DNA replication fidelity in the absence of
MMR, we used a S. cerevisiae strain containing a deletion of the
MSH2 gene and the rnr1-Y285F allele. Y285 is located in the al-
losteric specificity site of Rnr1, the large subunit of RNR. We have
previously demonstrated that rnr1-Y285F alone leads to a slightly
imbalanced elevation of dNTPs (3× dCTP, 3× dTTP, 1.8× dATP,
and 1× dGTP) that in turn results in a ∼2.5-fold increase in mu-
tation rate compared with WT (10), whereas msh2Δ alone in-
creases the mutation rate ∼15-fold compared with WT. The
msh2Δ rnr1-Y285F double mutant tested in this work had a ∼45-
fold increased mutation rate compared with WT, demonstrating
that minor changes in dNTP pools have a multiplicative effect in
combination with the loss of MMR (Fig. 3 A and B).
In mammalian cells, severe dNTP pool imbalances are known to
be mutagenic (47, 48), but to what extent minor dNTP pool changes
increase mutation rates is not well known. To model the effect of
minor dNTP pool changes on DNA replication fidelity in human
cancer cells, we measured mutation rates at the HPRT locus of the
HCT116 colorectal carcinoma cell line that was manipulated to
have altered dNTP pools. This cell line lacks functional MMR due
to a homozygous mutation of MLH1 (49), and it is commonly used
for the analysis of mutation rates under different conditions (50–
52). To alter intracellular dNTP pools in this cell line, we supple-
mented the cell culture medium with deoxyribonucleosides, which
are stepwise phosphorylated by deoxynucleoside (dN) kinases and
deoxyribonucleotide kinases into dNTPs (20). Addition of one
deoxyribonucleoside at high concentrations results in a dramatic
increase in one or several dNTPs and a depletion of one or several
other dNTPs because of the allosteric regulation of RNR. For ex-
ample, addition of 1 mM thymidine results in a ∼25-fold increase of
dTTP and a ∼10-fold decrease of the dCTP pool and leads to
S-phase arrest (53). This effect of thymidine is commonly used for
synchronization of cells by the so-called double thymidine block.
Therefore, we sought to identify conditions in which the addition of
several deoxyribonucleosides at lower concentrations would result
in a minor change of dNTP pools without a concomitant S-phase
arrest. We first tested thymidine at a concentration of 0.5 mM,
which resulted in an 11-fold increase in dTTP and a 5-fold decrease
in dCTP (Fig. S4A). Then, we tested thymidine at a concentration
of 0.05 mM, which resulted in a 2.8-fold increase in dTTP and a
2-fold decrease in dCTP (Fig. S4B). We then tested the addition of
deoxyadenosine alone and in combination with thymidine and
found that, in the presence of 50 μM thymidine and 20 μM
deoxyadenosine, dTTP and dATP increased approximately two-
fold and dCTP and dGTP levels decreased approximately twofold
(Fig. S4B and Fig. 3C). At these concentrations of dN, flow
cytometry analysis did not demonstrate any S-phase arrest (Fig.
3D). Therefore, we decided to proceed with measurements of
mutation rates in the presence or absence of 50 μM thymidine and
20 μM deoxyadenosine, according to the schematic in Fig. S5.
Mutation frequencies were invariably increased in the cell cultures
grown in the presence of 50 μM thymidine and 20 μM deoxy-
adenosine (Fig. 3E), whereas the population-doubling (PD) time
and cell-cycle progression were similar to the control cells grown
in the absence of deoxyribonucleosides (Fig. S6). Mutation rates
calculated by using mutation frequencies and PD times (Fig. 3E)
were approximately threefold higher in the cells grown with ex-
ogenous deoxyribonucleosides (4.46 × 10−5 vs. 1.45 × 10−5).
Discussion
Are dNTP pools altered in cancer cells compared with dNTP
pools in normal cells? And, if so, do changes in dNTP pools
contribute to the increased mutation rates and development of
cancer? These are not easy questions to answer. dNTP pools are
orders of magnitude lower than the corresponding NTP pools (54)
and are, for that reason, difficult to measure. Publications reporting
that cancer tissues have elevated dNTP pools compared with nor-
mal surrounding tissues are not informative because dNTPs are

 produced primarily during S phase. Thus, dNTP pools are high in
mitotic cells, such as cancer cells, and low in nondividing cells.
Comparisons of dNTP pools in cancerous and normal immortalized
cell lines in vitro also have caveats. First, the mitotic index, and thus
the proportion of S-phase cells containing elevated dNTP pools, is
often higher in cancerous cell lines. Second, the volume of cells in
different cell lines might vary. An apparent increase in dNTP pools
in cancerous cells will not result in a higher intracellular dNTP
concentration if the volume of such cells is also increased compared
with normal cells. Finally, dNTP pools in different cell lines in vitro
are affected by the nucleosides or bases present in the culture
medium (Fig. S4) (55). These dNTP precursors can be taken up
with different efficiencies depending on the status of the salvage
enzymes, such as thymidine kinase, deoxyguanosine kinase, and
deoxyadenosine kinase, in cancerous vs. normal cells.
Here, we propose that some colon cancers have altered in-
tracellular dNTP pools. We base our conclusion on the following
observations: (i) These cancers have mutations in SAMHD1, an
enzyme responsible for the degradation of dNTPs; (ii) the iden-
tified SAMHD1 mutations negatively affect its dNTPase activity
in vitro; and (iii) actively dividing hemizygous SAMHD1+/− mouse
embryos have increased dNTP pools compared with congenic WT
embryos of the same age. Previous dNTP pool measurements
were performed in various types of WT and SAMHD1−/− homo-
zygous cells, including E14.5 mouse embryonic fibroblasts (56, 57),
but, to our knowledge, ours is the first study to measure dNTP
pools in hemizygous SAMHD1 mouse embryos. This observation
is important because it demonstrates that cancer cells do not need
to inactivate both SAMHD1 alleles to increase the dNTP pools. Of
note, the genes encoding Pol e and δ are examples of two other
genes in which heterozygous mutations have recently been asso-
ciated with human cancers (58).
dNTP pool increases in SAMHD1+/− mouse embryos are modest
but significant and range from 20% to 60% (Fig. 2). In fact, even
modest changes of dNTP pools above or below normal levels can
have a profound effect on cellular physiology or DNA replication
fidelity. First, a mutation in the allosteric activity site of yeast RNR
(rnr1-D57N) leads to only a ∼1.6- to 2-fold increase in dNTP pools,
but a concomitant 3-fold increase in the mutation rate (11). Second,
inactivation of Sml1, an inhibitor of yeast RNR, leads to a ∼2.5-fold
increase in dNTP pools (59), and this slight increase is enough to
rescue the lethality of the deletion of MEC1 (yeast homolog of
mammalian ATR) (59) and to increase the speed of replication
forks by approximately 2-fold (60). Third, in mice, increased gene
dosage of the small RNR subunit Rrm2 elevates RNR activity, but
does not lead to elevated dNTP pools (61), presumably because of
the strict allosteric dATP feedback inhibition of the mammalian
RNR. Interestingly, despite any detectable increase in dNTP levels,
increased gene dosage of the small RNR subunit Rrm2 reduces
fragile site breakage and prolongs the survival of ATR mutant mice
(61). Fourth, the deletion of Dun1, a protein kinase that controls
yeast RNR, causes a ∼50% reduction of dNTP pools that, in turn,
decreases the mutagenic effect of proofreading-deficient Pol e
(pol2-4) by approximately threefold and results in a mutation rate
comparable to WT levels (18). Although the reduction of dNTP
levels increases the fidelity of DNA polymerases, it can also lead to

 fork stalling, the accumulation of single-stranded DNA, and chro-
mosomal rearrangements. Consistent with these outcomes, de-
creased dNTP pools have been proposed to be a source of genomic
instability in early stages of cancer development (62).
Cancer cells that have defects in replicative DNA polymerases
and/or MMR will be at further risk of having elevated mutation rates
due to minor dNTP pool alterations. We have recently demonstrated
that the introduction of the Pol e-M644G (a mutation that reduces
the accuracy of Pol e) or Pol δ-R696W (a human colon cancer-
associated mutation) into budding yeast cells results in replication
stress, leading to the activation of the genome integrity checkpoint
and concomitant elevation of dNTP pools (17–19). The checkpoint-
dependent elevation of dNTP pools was to a large degree re-
sponsible for the dramatic elevation of the mutation rates in these
polymerase-defective yeast strains. Here, we show that minor in-
creases of dNTP pools also have a profound effect on the mutation
rate in an MMR-deficient yeast strain. The onefold to threefold
increase in dNTP pools caused by the rnr1-Y285F substitution el-
evates the mutation rate from ∼65 × 10−7 in msh2Δ yeast to ∼200 ×
10−7 in msh2Δ rnr1-Y285F yeast (Fig. 3B). To model the effect of
minor dNTP pool alterations on the mutation rates in cancer cells,
we perturbed dNTP pools in the HCT116 colorectal carcinoma cell
line by adding low concentrations of thymidine and deoxyadenosine
to the growth medium. Such treatment resulted in an approximately
twofold increase in dTTP and dATP, an approximately twofold de-
crease in dCTP and dGTP, and a concomitant approximately
threefold elevation of mutation rates at the HPRT locus. Because the
HCT116 cells lack functional MMR, they already have ∼12-fold el-
evated mutation rates, compared with the HCT116 cells with normal
MMR function (52). Our results indicate that minor alterations of
dNTP pools further elevate mutation rates in MMR-deficient cells.
Replication stress-dependent activation of the genome integrity
checkpoint has been shown to lead to elevated dNTP pools and to
higher mutation rates in budding yeast (11). In contrast to yeast,
genome integrity checkpoint activation in mammalian cells does
not result in a similar global expansion of the dNTP pools (63). It is
possible that, in response to checkpoint activation, there are local
increases of dNTP levels near the sites of DNA damage. For ex-
ample, colocalization of RNR and dTMP kinase at the sites of DNA
damage has been reported (64, 65), but it is not known whether
RNR and dTMP kinase colocalize at stalled replication forks. It is
also not clear whether the rest of the machinery required for the
production of dNTPs—including dUTPase, dCMP deaminase,
dTMP synthase, dTMP kinase, and NDP kinase—colocalize at the
sites of DNA damage. Even if there is no local checkpoint-de-
pendent increase in dNTP pools in the mammalian cells in response
to replication stress, it is possible that dNTP pools increase due to
mutation or misregulation of one or more of the many enzymes
involved in nucleotide metabolism.
In this study, we demonstrate that mutations in SAMHD1 that
alter its dNTPase activity are associated with colon cancer. We
speculate that other mutations that elevate or imbalance dNTP pools
will also be identified in cancer cells, and we propose that minor
dNTP pool disturbances in combination with defects in proofreading
or MMR might enhance the mutator phenotype of cancer cells.
Recently, the minidriver model of polygenic cancer evolution has
been put forward (66). This model proposes that many mutations
found in cancer might not be major drivers or “passenger” mutations,
but instead might have relatively weak tumor-promoting effects and
are referred to as “mini drivers.” It has been suggested that multiple
mini drivers can substitute for a major driver. We believe that mu-
tations in SAMHD1 that are predicted to result in mutagenic dNTP
pool alterations fall into the category of mini drivers.
The findings presented here might have implications for the
treatment of mutator-driven cancers. Chemotherapeutic reduction
of dNTP pools could decrease mutation rates and slow down
cancer progression, whereas an additional elevation of dNTP
pools by treatment with exogenous deoxyribonucleosides might
further increase mutation rates and kill cancer cells through
mutation overload.
Experimental Procedures
Public Databases. The cancer mutation database COSMIC was used to get an
overview of reported SAMHD1 mutations in solid cancers. For detailed studies
of tumors with SAMHD1 mutations, the publicly available mutation dataset
(hgsc.bcm.edu COAD.IlluminaGA DNASeq.Level 2.1.5.0), consisting of data
from 217 CRC tumors analyzed by using Illumina exome sequencing tech-
nology, was downloaded from TCGA. Only publicly available datasets were
used for all analyses.
In Silico Analysis of Mutations. The deleteriousness of the SAMHD1 mutations
in the tumors of the large intestine from COSMIC was analyzed by using four
different computational tools: Grantham, SIFT, PolyPhen2, and CADD. Be-
cause these are prediction tools, we increased our confidence in their results
by taking into consideration the overlap between them when evaluating
whether mutations were likely to affect protein function. ConSurf was used
to generate conservation scores from 1 to 9, with 9 being the most con-
served amino acids within the protein. The TCGA mutation dataset was
analyzed by using the SMG test from the MuSIC suite with default settings in
all cases except for background mutation rate groups, which was set to 2
based on the fact that colon cancers can be divided into hypermutated
and non-hypermutated.
SAMHD1 Expression and Purification. The pGEX-6P-1 plasmids encoding
N-terminal GST-tagged WT and mutant SAMHD1 were expressed in Escherichia
coli (BL21) grown in LB medium by using 0.4 mM isopropyl β-D-1-thio-
galactopyranoside for induction at 18 °C for 16 h, and the proteins were
purified essentially as described (67). After batch loading on 1.5 mL of
glutathione–Sepharose (GE Healthcare), the beads were collected in a column
and washed twice with 10 mL of buffer A [50 mM Tris·HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mM
NaCl, 1 mM DTT, and 10% (vol/vol) glycerol]. The GST affinity tag was removed
by overnight enzymatic cleavage with PreScission Protease. SAMHD1 was
eluted and stored in buffer A.
SAMHD1 in Vitro dNTPase Assay. dNTPase assays were performed essentially as
described (68). Reactions in a total volume of 300 μL [10 mM Tris·HCl (pH 7.5),
50 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM GTP, 1 mM dNTP, and 0.5 μM SAMHD1] were
incubated at 25 °C. Aliquots collected at 0, 15, 30, 45, and 60 min were diluted
in nine volumes of ice-cold PBS to stop the reaction and spun through a 0.5-mL
Nanosep 3-kDa filter (PALL) at 14,000 × g for 10 min. The deproteinized
samples were analyzed by HPLC using an UltraCore SuperC18 50-mm × 2.1-mm
column (ACE) equilibrated in buffer (7% MeOH and 17 mM KH2PO4, pH 6.0).
The dN products were quantified in buffer (7% MeOH and 17 mM KH2PO4, pH
6.0) by using the peak integration of the mV response. The specific activity of
SAMHD1 was defined as nanomoles of dN product per hour (1 nmol of dN
per hour = 1 unit) per milligram of protein [(nanomoles of dN per hour)
per milligram].
dNTP Pool Measurements in Mouse Embryos. All animal experiments were
approved by the Animal Review Board at the Court of Appeal of Northern
Norrland (Umea). Homozygous SAMHD1−/− knockout mice in the C57BL/6
background (57) were kindly provided by Jan Rehwinkel (University of
Oxford, Oxford) and mated with WT C57BL/6 mice. From these crosses,
E13.5 embryos were isolated, and after their tails were removed for geno-
typing, the embryos were snap-frozen in Eppendorf tubes in liquid ni-
trogen. After the addition of ice-cold 12% (wt/vol) TCA, 15 mM MgCl2
solution, and glass beads, the embryos were thawed on ice and homoge-
nized on a BeadBeater (BioSpec) for 30 s at 4 °C in a cold room. The su-
pernatant was collected by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C
and processed as described (69).
dNTP Pool and Mutation Rate Measurements in S. cerevisiae. All yeast culturing
was carried out at 30 °C in YPAD (1% yeast extract, 2% bacto-peptone, and
20 mg/L adenine) liquid cultures in a shaking incubator at 160 rpm. For
plates, the YPAD contained 2% agar. dNTP pools were measured in asyn-
chronous cultures as described (69). The canavanine resistance assay was
used to calculate mutation rates as described (10).
