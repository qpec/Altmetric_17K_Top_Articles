Abstract
Background: Elective surgeries can be associated with significant harm to older adults. The present study aimed to
identify the prognostic factors associated with the development of postoperative complications among older adults
undergoing elective surgery.
Methods: Medline, EMBASE, CINAHL, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and AgeLine were searched for
articles published between inception and April 21, 2016. Prospective studies reporting prognostic factors associated
with postoperative complications (composite outcome of medical and surgical complications), functional decline,
mortality, post-hospitalization discharge destination, and prolonged hospitalization among older adults undergoing
elective surgery were included. Study characteristics and prognostic factors associated with the outcomes of interest
were extracted independently by two reviewers. Random effects meta-analysis models were used to derive pooled
effect estimates for prognostic factors and incidences of adverse outcomes.
Results: Of the 5692 titles and abstracts that were screened for inclusion, 44 studies (12,281 patients) reported on the
following adverse postoperative outcomes: postoperative complications (n =28), postoperative mortality (n = 11), length
of hospitalization (n = 21), functional decline (n = 6), and destination at discharge from hospital (n = 13). The pooled
incidence of postoperative complications was 25.17% (95% confidence interval (CI) 18.03–33.98%, number needed to
follow = 4). The geriatric syndromes of frailty (odds ratio (OR) 2.16, 95% CI 1.29–3.62) and cognitive impairment
(OR 2.01, 95% CI 1.44–2.81) were associated with developing postoperative complications; however, there was no
association with traditionally assessed prognostic factors such as age (OR 1.07, 95% CI 1.00–1.14) or American
Society of Anesthesiologists status (OR 2.62, 95% CI 0.78–8.79). Besides frailty, other potentially modifiable prognostic
factors, including depressive symptoms (OR 1.77, 95% CI 1.22–2.56) and smoking (OR 2.43, 95% CI 1.32–4.46), were also
associated with developing postoperative complications.
Conclusion: Geriatric syndromes are important prognostic factors for postoperative complications. We identified
potentially modifiable prognostic factors (e.g., frailty, depressive symptoms, and smoking) associated with developing
postoperative complications that can be targeted preoperatively to optimize care.

 Background
As the number of older adults increases globally, there will
be a greater need for elective surgeries in this patient popu-
lation; however, elective surgeries can be associated with
significant harm to patients [1–5]. Special preoperative
consideration must be given to the greater prevalence of
geriatric syndromes faced by older adults, such as frailty
and functional impairment, that potentially increase their
risk of adverse postoperative outcomes [6, 7]. Indeed, older
adults are a heterogeneous group of patients whose risk of
adverse postoperative outcomes is not adequately de-
scribed by chronological age, comorbidities, or the type of
surgical procedure alone [8]. Although older adults are
often seen in the preoperative medicine clinic for cardio-
vascular and respiratory risk stratification and optimization
in anticipation of an elective surgery, little consideration is
given to risk stratification for other adverse outcomes that
occur in older adults, despite the availability of information
to aid in this assessment [9].
Understanding the risk factors for postoperative com-
plications may help clinicians, patients, and caregivers
to target non-pharmacological and pharmacological in-
terventions aimed at lessening the burden of these ad-
verse postoperative outcomes. This systematic review
synthesizes studies that identify preoperative prognostic
factors of older adults undergoing elective surgery
which may predispose them to adverse postoperative
outcomes. This information can be used by clinicians
and patients to enhance decision-making and manage-
ment in the preoperative setting and by researchers to
study possible interventions aimed at improving post-
operative outcomes for older adults.
Methods
This study was reported in accordance with both the
PRISMA statement for reporting systematic reviews and
meta-analyses and the MOOSE statement for reporting
meta-analysis of observation studies in epidemiology
(Additional file 1) [10, 11]. This systematic review and
meta-analysis has a companion publication that focuses
on prognostic factors associated with postoperative delir-
ium among older adults undergoing elective surgery.
Eligibility criteria
Prospective studies (e.g., randomized controlled trials
(RCTs),
quasi-RCTs,
non-RCTs,
controlled-before-and-
after studies, prospective cohort studies) were eligible if
they included older adults undergoing elective surgery
(≥60 years old and mean age of patients enrolled in the
study ≥ 65 years old) and reported prognostic factors asso-
ciated with the postoperative complications of mortality,
functional decline, prolonged length of hospitalization, dis-
charge to a location other than home, and a composite out-
come of medical or surgical complications. All definitions
of a given prognostic factor were included. Studies that in-
cluded patients ≥ 60 years old were selected to align with
definitions from the United Nations and the World Health
Organization [12, 13]. Geriatric medicine consultation ser-
vices typically target these age ranges [14, 15]. Studies using
any method for diagnosing postoperative complications
were eligible. Postoperative mortality was defined as death
within 30 days following surgery. If a study reported both
elective and emergent surgical procedures, it was included
in our systematic review only if there was a separate sub-
group reported for patients undergoing elective surgery. To
make the review feasible, studies reporting only clinical,
laboratory, or imaging investigations that are not con-
ducted as part of routine clinical practice (i.e., measuring
serum interleukin levels) were excluded, as were studies
disseminated in languages other than English.
Information sources and search strategy
An experienced librarian searched MEDLINE (OVID
interface, 1948 to April Week 3, 2016), EMBASE (OVID
interface, 1980 to April Week 3, 2016), CINAHL (EBSCO
interface, 1994 to April 21, 2016), Cochrane Central
Register of Controlled Trials (Issue 4, April 2016), and
AgeLine (EBSCO interface, 1968 to April 21, 2016) for
potentially relevant studies. The full search strategy for
MEDLINE (Additional file 2: Appendix 1) was modified as
necessary for the other databases (full searches available
upon request). Scanning the reference lists of included
studies
and
searching
the
authors’
personal
files
supplemented the electronic search. Authors of conference
proceedings were contacted to obtain unpublished work.
Study selection
Two levels of screening were completed independently by
two reviewers using Synthesi.SR (proprietary online soft-
ware developed by the Knowledge Translation Program,
Toronto, Canada); these were level 1 screening of titles
and abstracts, and level 2, full-text screening of articles. A
calibration exercise was conducted prior to level 1 screen-
ing whereby each reviewer independently screened 10% of
a random sample of citations to ensure adequate inter-
rater agreement. Study authors were contacted for further
information if it was unclear whether the study met inclu-
sion criteria. Disagreements concerning article inclusion
were resolved through discussion; otherwise, a third
reviewer was available to make a final decision.
Data abstraction
Data were abstracted independently by two reviewers from
studies retained from level 2 screening. Study characteris-
tics (e.g., study design, country of conduct), patient charac-
teristics (e.g., mean age, sex, comorbidities), and prognostic
factors associated with the outcomes of interest were ab-
stracted from included studies. Definitions operationalized
Watt et al. BMC Medicine  (2018) 16:2 
Page 2 of 14
 by study authors for individual prognostic factors were also
abstracted, where appropriate. Conflicts regarding the
abstracted data were resolved through discussion. Authors
were contacted for further information when the data were
not clearly reported. The publication with the longest
duration of follow-up was considered the major publica-
tion when multiple studies reported data from the same
source. The other publications were retained as supple-
mentary material only.
Methodological quality assessment
Two reviewers independently appraised the risk of bias
using the Cochrane Risk-of-Bias Tool for RCTs and the
Newcastle–Ottawa Scale for cohort studies [16, 17]. We
planned to assess other study designs with the Cochrane
Effective Practice and Organization Care (EPOC) Risk-of-
Bias Tool [18]. If two or more outcomes were reported in
a single study, the quality assessment was preferentially
conducted on the outcome of postoperative complications
or destination at discharge from hospital.
Statistical methods
We calculated odds ratios (OR) to quantify the relative
risk of postoperative complications associated with each
prognostic factor. Whenever only continuous effect
measures, such as mean differences (e.g., age, body mass
index) were reported, these effect sizes were transformed
to OR estimates, if needed, to derive an overall effect
estimate that combined both dichotomous and continu-
ous study-level effect estimates [19]. For studies that
reported multiple options with which to derive the
study-level effect estimate (e.g., 2 × 2 tables, adjusted and
unadjusted ORs, mean differences), the order of prefer-
ence for selecting the source data is described in
Additional file 2: Appendix 2.
Random effects models were used to derive overall ef-
fect estimates with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) when
two or more studies reported extractable effect estimates
that could be combined for the purpose of meta-
analysis. The number needed to follow (NNF) was calcu-
lated as 1/pooled incidence of each postoperative com-
plication. Similar to the concept of the number needed
to treat or number needed to harm, the NNF represents
the number of patients who need to be followed in a
prognostic study in order to see one outcome [20]. In-
formation regarding data imputation methods to ap-
proximate
standard
deviation
values
is
found
in
Additional file 2: Appendix 3. Between-study statistical
heterogeneity was quantitatively assessed with the I2 stat-
istic and thresholds for the interpretation of the I2 statistic
were consistent with those reported in the Cochrane
Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions [21].
Subgroup analyses were conducted by surgery type to
explore between-study heterogeneity. Mixed-effects meta-
regression models were also used to evaluate the effect of
study-level effect modifiers (age, publication year, and type
of surgery) on the pooled incidence of postoperative
complications. Sensitivity analyses were conducted based
on the type of study-level effect estimates used to calculate
the overall effect estimates, - including study-level effect
estimates that were adjusted for potentially important con-
founders only. A prognostic factor was considered signifi-
cantly associated with the primary or secondary outcomes
at a two-tailed p-value < 0.05. We planned to test for pub-
lication bias; however, this was not possible because there
were no prognostic factors that were reported in at least
10 studies. All statistical analyses were conducted in R,
version 3.2.4, using the metafor and meta packages [22,
23].
Results
Of the 5692 titles and abstracts that were screened for in-
clusion, 44 studies, including 12,281 patients, met our
inclusion criteria (Fig. 1). From the 44 included studies,
prognostic factors associated with postoperative complica-
tions (n = 28), postoperative mortality (n = 10), length of
hospitalization (n = 22), functional decline (n = 6), and des-
tination at discharge from hospital (n = 13) were retrieved.
Two RCTs were included, which were at moderate to high
risk of bias (Additional file 2: Appendix 4). Overall, the in-
cluded
cohort
studies
were
of
moderate
to
high
methodological quality (Additional file 2: Appendix 5). The
most common biases were the adequacy of follow-up of
cohorts and the comparability of the cohorts on the basis
of design.
Postoperative complications
Twenty-eight studies (6708 patients) investigated the asso-
ciation between preoperative prognostic factors and post-
operative complications (Additional file 1: Appendix 6). Of
these, 23 were included in the meta-analyses of prognostic
factors [1, 6, 7, 24–43]. The five studies not included in
meta-analyses did not contain extractable data, report
prognostic factors that were included in two or more stud-
ies, or present data in a format that could be pooled with
other study-level effect estimates. Postoperative complica-
tions were most often reported as a composite of postoper-
ative medical or surgical complications (e.g., pneumonia,
wound infection, venous thromboembolism), the details of
which are found in Additional file 2: Appendix 6. The
pooled incidence of postoperative complications across all
surgical types was 25.16% (95% CI 18.26–33.61%, 21 stud-
ies, I2 = 96%, NNF = 4) [1, 7, 25–28, 30–33, 35–38, 40–46].
In exploring the influence of type of surgery on incident
complications, the number of complications remained
high: cardiac surgery (9.46%, 95% CI 2.71–28.18%, 3 stu-
dies, I2 = 96.40%, NNF = 11), abdominal surgery (24.73%,
Watt et al. BMC Medicine  (2018) 16:2 
Page 3 of 14
 95% CI 8.63–53.33%, 3 studies, I2 = 96.1%, NNF = 5), and
thoracic surgery (33.97%, 95% CI 12.66–64.62%, 4 studies,
I2 = 95.5%, NNF = 3). The effects of the mean age of study
patients, publication year, and type of surgery on the
pooled incidence of postoperative complications were ex-
plored with meta-regression, but did not explain any of the
variance in the models.
The prognostic factors most strongly associated with
the development of postoperative complications were
poor performance status as defined by the Eastern
Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) score or the
Karnofsky Index (OR 2.58, 95% CI 1.56–4.25, 5 studies,
I2 = 0%), smoking status (OR 2.43, 95% CI 1.32–4.46, 3
studies, I2 = 0%), impairment in instrumental activities of
daily living (IADLs) (OR 2.27, 95% CI 1.65–3.14, 6 stud-
ies, I2 = 0%), frailty (OR 2.16, 95% CI 1.29–3.62, 8 stud-
ies, I2 = 54.69%), and cognitive impairment (OR 2.01,
95% CI 1.44–2.81, 8 studies, I2 = 0%) (Table 1, Additional
file 2: Appendix 7). Frailty was most frequently defined
using the definition of Fried et al. [47]; however, other
definitions included the Edmonton Frailty Scale, gait
speed, or a tool created by individual study authors [48].
In a subgroup of frail patients undergoing abdominal
surgery, there was no longer an association between
frailty and postoperative complications (OR 1.73, 95% CI
0.81–3.66, 3 studies, I2 = 53.36%) [29, 35, 40]. These
findings remained consistent when sensitivity analyses
were conducted whereby only those studies reporting
study-level
effect
estimates
adjusted
for
important
confounders were included.
Other prognostic factors that were reported in sin-
gle studies as significantly associated with postopera-
tive complications were the cumulative number of
impairments in the comprehensive geriatric assess-
ment (OR 1.84, 95% CI 1.27–2.65), not being able to
shop independently (P = 0.011), answering ‘yes’ to the
question ‘Have you dropped many of your activities
and
interests?’
on
the
Geriatric
Depression
Scale
(GDS) [49] (P = 0.04), the presence of one or more
Goldman indicators [50] (P < 0.005), and the inability
to bicycle 2 minutes to a heart rate greater than 99
beats/min (P < 0.05) [44, 45, 51]. The presence of anx-
iety (OR 5.1, 95% CI 1.27–20.2), Society of Thoracic
Surgeons score [52] (OR 1.06, 95% CI 1.01–1.10), and
female sex (OR 3.49, 95% CI 1.52–7.99) were associ-
ated with mortality or major morbidity in patients
undergoing cardiac surgery [53].
Energy intake > 21.3 kcal/kg of actual body weight
(OR
2.40,

CI
0.59–9.80),
energy
intake >
22.2 kcal/kg of ideal body weight (OR 5.00, 95% CI
0.95–26.17), or any of the items on the Nutrition
Screening Initiative Nutritional Health Checklist [54]
were not associated with postoperative complications
[45, 46]. Besides answering ‘yes’ to the question ‘Have
you dropped many of your activities and interests?’
on the GDS, none of the other questions were associ-
ated with postoperative complications. Similarly, no
activities of daily living (ADLs) or IADLs, besides
shopping, were individually associated with postopera-
tive complications [45].

 Postoperative mortality
The association between preoperative prognostic factors
and postoperative mortality was investigated in 11 stud-
ies (3399 patients) (Table 2) [1–3, 25, 30, 32, 51, 53, 55–
57]. The pooled incidence of mortality was 4.58% (95%
CI 3.67–5.71%, 11 studies, I2 = 46.30%, NNF = 21) [1–3,
25, 30, 32, 51, 53, 55–57]. Among patients undergoing
cardiac surgery, the pooled incidence of mortality was
5.21% (4.00–6.75%, 6 studies, I2 = 60.8%, NNF = 20).
Only the effects of publication year could be explored in
a meta-regression because there were not enough stud-
ies to explore the effects of type of surgery or mean age
of patients on the pooled incidence of mortality. Publica-
tion year did not explain any of the variance in the
meta-regression model. Few prognostic factors were
reported in more than one study. No significant associ-
ation was identified between male sex (OR 1.46, 95% CI
0.67–3.19, 4 studies, I2 = 53.92%), diabetes mellitus (HR
1.74, 95% CI 0.54–5.61, 2 studies, I2 = 45.26%), or history
of heart failure (HR 1.86, 95% CI 0.44–7.88, 2 studies, I2
= 68.34%) and postoperative mortality (Additional file 2:
Appendix 8) [1, 30, 32, 55, 56].
Length of hospitalization
A total of 21 studies (5037 patients) investigated preopera-
tive prognostic factors and length of hospitalization
(Table 3) [1, 2, 7, 24, 25, 27, 29–31, 35–37, 39, 45, 46, 51,
53, 58–61]. Substantial between-study heterogeneity in
the reporting of outcomes and few prognostic factors be-
ing reported in more than one study largely precluded
pooling of study-level effect estimates. There was no asso-
ciation between higher American Society of Anesthesiolo-
gists (ASA) score and prolonged hospitalization (OR 0.82,
95% CI 0.30–2.23, 2 studies, I2 = 0%) (Additional file 2:
Appendix 9) [2, 31]. Among six studies that investigated
frailty as a prognostic factor for prolonged hospitalization,
there was a significant association identified in four
studies [7, 29, 35, 37, 40, 61]. One study found that,
while frail patients with postoperative complications
had prolonged hospitalizations (P < 0.001), those with-
out
postoperative
complications
did
not
(P = 0.19)
[36]. Age was identified as a significant prognostic
factor for prolonged hospitalization in only two of six
studies [1, 2, 6, 26, 33, 51, 62–64].
Destination at discharge from hospital
In total, 13 studies (2601 patients) investigated associa-
tions between preoperative prognostic factors and the
destination at discharge from hospital (e.g., skilled
nursing facility vs. discharge to home) (Table 4) [2, 7, 25,
29, 37, 38, 40, 45, 51, 53, 61, 65, 66]. Patients were dis-
charged to a number of locations, including other
hospitals, nursing homes, rehabilitation centres, transi-
tional care facilities, and assisted-living facilities. The

 pooled incidence of discharge from hospital to a destin-
ation other than home was 13.65% (8.90–20.39%, 9 stud-
ies, I2 = 91.6%, NNF = 8) [2, 25, 37, 38, 40, 45, 51, 53,
66]. In a subgroup of older adults undergoing general
surgery, the pooled incidence of being discharged to a
non-home location was 9.97% (6.59–12.39%, 2 studies,
I2 = 0%, NNF = 11) [2, 40]. Only the effects of publica-
tion year could be explored in a meta-regression because
there were not enough studies to explore the effects of
type of surgery or mean age of patients on the pooled in-
cidence of mortality. Publication year did not explain
any of the variance in the meta-regression model. In an-
other subgroup of older adults, the pooled incidence of
being discharged to a nursing home was 9.97% (5.30–
17.96%, 2 studies, I2 = 86%) [37, 66]. Meta-analysis of
data from five studies (1228 patients) found that frailty
was associated with non-home discharge following elect-
ive surgery (OR 3.42, 95% CI 1.35–8.68, I2 = 67.46%)
(Additional file 2: Appendix 10) [7, 29, 37, 38, 40]. In an
additional study, the odds of being transferred to an-
other hospital were six times greater for frail patients (P
= 0.002) (Table 4) [61]. There were a number of
prognostic factors that were associated with an increased
risk of non-home destination at discharge from hospital,
namely older age, weight loss ≥ 10%, ASA score ≥ 2,
ECOG performance status ≥ 2, and lower self-reported
mobility [2, 7, 37, 66, 67].
Functional decline
Six studies (1426 patients) investigated the association be-
tween preoperative prognostic factors and postoperative
functional decline (Table 5) [63–65, 68–70]. All six studies
reported prognostic factors associated with postoperative
impairment in a patient’s ability to perform ADLs. One
study reported risk factors associated with postoperative
impairment in the ability to perform IADLs [63]. The

 pooled incidence of decline in ADLs was 21.03% (9.94–

In a subgroup of patients undergoing general surgery,
the pooled incidence of decline in ADLs was 15.25%
(5.48–35.83%, 2 studies, I2 = 95.7%, NNF = 7) [63, 64].
Age was not found to be associated with postopera-
tive impairment in ADLs at 4–6 weeks, 3 months, or
1 year after elective surgery; however, one study did
show an association between age and impairment in
ADLs in the postoperative period [63–65, 68, 70].
Baseline MMSE score was not associated with a de-
cline in ADLs, but it was associated with a decline in
IADLs [63, 64].

 Common geriatric syndromes, such as functional impair-
ment, cognitive impairment, and frailty, were associated
with the composite outcome of postoperative complica-
tions, while more traditional perioperative risk factors in
the medical literature, such as older age and ASA status,
were not [71]. Although the pooled incidences of adverse
postoperative outcomes must be interpreted with caution
because of significant between-study heterogeneity, it is
worth noting that approximately one in four older adults
suffered a postoperative complication from undergoing
elective surgery. Fortunately, we identified a number of
potentially modifiable risk factors, including smoking sta-
tus, depressive symptoms, and frailty, that can be explored
in future studies aimed at preventing adverse postopera-
tive outcomes in older adults undergoing elective surgery.
The finding that geriatric syndromes, but not older age
or ASA status, were associated with postoperative compli-
cations warrants further discussion. In particular, frailty is
felt to represent a patient’s biological age as opposed to
their chronological age, which may explain why frailty and
not older age was associated with postoperative complica-
tions in this setting [72]. Frail patients were also less likely
to be discharged to their home, which again likely reflects
their decreased physiological reserve to respond to a sig-
nificant stressor such as surgery. Besides being associated
with postoperative complications, frailty has been associ-
ated with a number of other adverse outcomes outside of
the
perioperative
literature,
including
mortality
and
admission to a long-term care facility [73, 74]. Perhaps
greater emphasis should be placed on a patient’s frailty
status as opposed to their age in determining risk of ad-
verse postoperative outcomes as part of a comprehensive
preoperative assessment [9].
The high incidence of adverse outcomes (25% of
patients experiencing a postoperative complication), even
in this non-emergent surgical setting, was also surprising.
There was significant between-study heterogeneity among
studies
reporting
postoperative
complications,
which
could not be completely explained by type of surgery, but
instead likely reflects the range of postoperative complica-
tions that were reported by study authors (e.g., atelectasis,
venous thromboembolism, death). In the future, it will be
important for more researchers to identify postoperative
complications by severity so that knowledge users (e.g.,
patients, clinicians) can have a better-informed discussion
as to a patient’s risk of developing different postoperative
complications.
To our knowledge, this is the first systematic review
and meta-analysis that comprehensively examined the
association between preoperative prognostic factors and
adverse postoperative outcomes among older adults
undergoing elective surgery. A recent narrative review
on adverse postoperative outcomes among older adults
included patients with different indications for surgery,
such as hip fracture or other emergent procedures, and
did not conduct meta-analyses of prognostic factors
[75]. We targeted older adults undergoing elective
surgery because of the potential to intervene to improve
patient outcomes by identifying and optimizing these
factors
preoperatively.
Multicomponent
interventions
aimed at improving a patient’s nutrition, physical fitness,
and cognition have shown promise in improving frailty
[76]. Similarly, smoking status and depressive symptoms
are potentially modifiable prognostic factors that were
associated with developing postoperative complications.
Interventions for preoperative smoking cessation have
been associated with a lower risk of postoperative com-
plications [77]. These prognostic factors could be tar-
geted in the preoperative clinic.
There were limitations in our study’s review process.
Firstly, only studies that were published in English were
included in this review to increase feasibility, but our
findings are likely generalizable given the number of
geographical
regions
represented
in
our
systematic
review. Secondly, there was substantial heterogeneity be-
tween studies for some outcomes, which could not al-
ways be adequately explored given a limited number of
studies and a lack of individual patient-level data. In-
deed, it is possible that by including such a broad
spectrum of elective surgical procedures we may create
difficulty in understanding exactly which prognostic fac-
tors are most likely to be important for certain patients,
but this was explored in subgroup analyses and meta-
regression models, where possible. Additionally, this
study was initiated prior to the introduction of the
CHARMS checklist, which means that biases introduced
in model development, validation, and evaluation of our
included studies are less well described; however, we feel
that we were able to identify important sources of selec-
tion bias, measurement bias, and confounding that
threatened the validity of individual study findings [78].
There were also limitations imparted by the included
studies themselves. The methodological quality assess-
ment demonstrated that there were a number of studies
reporting varying intensity of follow-up, which may have
impacted the incidence of complications. The majority
of studies included in this systematic review were cohort
studies; therefore, our findings may be influenced by
confounding. Sensitivity analyses demonstrated that our
findings were largely consistent when only study-level
effect estimates that were adjusted for potentially im-
portant confounders were included in the meta-analyses.
Lastly, sometimes studies did not report independent
variables for which there was a non-significant associ-
ation with the dependent variable in the final multivari-
able model, which could potentially lead to a type 1
error in the findings of our meta-analyses. This is a limi-
tation that is inherent in the prognosis literature that we

 hope will be overcome in the future by improved quality
of reporting.
Our study had a number of strengths. There were 44
studies and over 12,000 patients included in our system-
atic review and meta-analyses, which allowed us to
investigate a number of possible prognostic factors. The
hypothesis-generating nature of this study allowed for
the identification of prognostic factors that are poten-
tially modifiable in the preoperative setting, which could
lead to better surgical outcomes for older adults under-
going elective surgery.
Conclusions
In summary, this systematic review and meta-analysis
highlights how common postoperative complications are
among older adults undergoing elective surgery (NNF = 4)
and the importance of geriatric syndromes in identifying
older adults at risk of harm. Furthermore, there were sev-
eral prognostic factors identified that could be modifiable
in a preoperative setting, including smoking and frailty,
which can be explored in future knowledge translation
strategies to develop interventions aimed at mitigating the
risk faced by older adults undergoing elective surgery.
