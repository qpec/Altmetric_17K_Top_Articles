Unconventional oil and gas (UOG) operations, which combine hydraulic fracturing (fracking) and
directional drilling, involve the use of hundreds of chemicals, including many with endocrine-
disrupting properties. Two previous studies examined mice exposed during early development to a
23-chemical mixture of UOG compounds (UOG-MIX) commonly used or produced in the process.
Both male and female offspring exposed prenatally to one or more doses of UOG-MIX displayed
alterations to endocrine organ function and serum hormone concentrations. We hypothesized that
prenatal UOG-MIX exposure would similarly disrupt development of the mouse mammary gland.
Female C57Bl/6 mice were exposed to ~3, ~30, ~ 300, or ~3000 mg/kg/d UOG-MIX from gestational
day 11 to birth. Although no effects were observed on the mammary glands of these females before
puberty, in early adulthood, females exposed to 300 or 3000 mg/kg/d UOG-MIX developed more
dense mammary epithelial ducts; females exposed to 3 mg/kg/d UOG-MIX had an altered ratio of
apoptosis to proliferation in the mammary epithelium. Furthermore, adult females from all UOG-
MIX–treated groups developed intraductal hyperplasia that resembled terminal end buds (i.e.,
highly proliferative structures typically seen at puberty). These results suggest that the mammary
gland is sensitive to mixtures of chemicals used in UOG production at exposure levels that are
environmentally relevant. The effect of these findings on the long-term health of the mammary
gland, including its lactational capacity and its risk of cancer, should be evaluated in future studies.

U
nconventional oil and gas (UOG) operations com-
bine hydraulic fracturing (fracking) and directional
drilling. These techniques were developed to collect de-
posits of oil and natural gas found in deep underground
shale beds in low-permeability geologic formations (1).
During the fracking process, a mixture of water and
chemicals is pumped deep into the shale bed under high
pressure, fracturing the reservoir rock, and releasing
deposits of gas and/or oil, which can then be recovered
at the surface. More than 1000 different chemicals are
reportedly used during UOG operations for a range of
purposes, including compounds that act as bactericides,
stabilizers for the clay in the ground, chemicals that alter
friction and fluid viscosity, and others, although each
individual site typically uses only 12 to 24 of these
compounds. During UOG operations, up to several
million gallons of water are injected per well, and a
mixture of injected fluids and target formation water are
collected throughout the life of the producing well.
With .17 million Americans living within 1 mile of an oil
and gas well (2), concerns have been raised about the
possibility of contamination of surface and groundwater
by the released oil and gas, the numerous inorganic
compounds that are liberated from target geologic layers
(e.g., trace metals, radioactive isotopes, minerals), and the
chemicals used in well injection (3, 4).
More than 1000 chemicals have been identified in
hydraulic fracturing fluids and waste water and/or have

 been reported to be used by the industry (5, 6). Many of
these chemicals are known developmental and repro-
ductive toxicants (7). Furthermore, recent evaluations
found that .100 of these chemicals are known or sus-
pected endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) (4, 8–10)
(i.e., compounds that interfere with hormone action)
(11). Water samples collected in drilling-dense or UOG
wastewater-affected areas of the United States have
exhibited disruption of the estrogen, androgen, proges-
terone, glucocorticoid, and thyroid receptors (4, 8, 12).
In 2015, Kassotis et al. (13) evaluated 24 chemicals
that were reported by industry as commonly used and/or
produced by UOG operations to determine whether they
displayed endocrine-disrupting properties. With cell-based
reporter gene assays, their study revealed antiandrogenic,
antiestrogenic, antiprogestogenic, antithyroidogenic,
and antiglucocorticogenic activities for many of these
compounds. When evaluated as mixtures, additive and,
in some cases, synergistic antagonism of these receptors
was also observed. Kassotis et al. (13) then evaluated the
effects of a 23-chemical mixture of UOG chemicals
(UOG-MIX) on male mice. This mixture included the 24
chemicals originally assessed, absent bisphenol A, a well-
characterized EDC that has been evaluated at length
previously (14, 15) but that is not directly used in UOG
extraction, as reported by the industry (16). Only one of
the chemicals included in this list (Table 1), benzene, was
evaluated in a review of 216 chemicals for carcinogenic
effects in the mammary gland, highlighting the general
lack of knowledge on these chemicals (17). Male mice
exposed to environmentally relevant doses of UOG-MIX
during prenatal development displayed an increased
testicular weight before puberty and, in adulthood, de-
creased sperm counts, increased serum testosterone
concentrations, and alterations to the weight of addi-
tional organs, including the heart and thymus (13).
A second study revealed the effects of developmental
exposures to UOG-MIX on the female siblings (18).
Exposed females had alterations to the number and de-
velopmental stages of ovarian follicles measured be-
fore puberty and in adulthood. The weight of several
organs, including the uterus, ovary, and heart, was
also affected. Furthermore, the serum concentrations of
several hormones were disrupted in these exposed fe-
males. These results suggest the possibility that other
hormone-sensitive organs might be disrupted by expo-
sure to UOG chemical mixtures.
The mouse mammary gland has proved to be an ex-
cellent model to study the effects of EDCs (19–21). The
development of the mammary gland is dependent on es-
trogen, progesterone, prolactin, testosterone, and growth
hormone, making it an integrated biological endpoint that
is sensitive to the agonists and antagonists of different
hormone receptors (22). The estrogen receptor (ER) is
expressed in the mesenchymal compartment of the fetal
gland; however, its expression shifts to the epithelial
compartment in the adult gland (23). Although ERa
knockout mice have mammary glands that are in-
distinguishable from those of wild-type controls before
puberty, they are visibly stunted compared with controls
once puberty begins, highlighting the importance of es-
trogen for growth of the gland (24, 25). The androgen
receptor (AR) is also expressed in the mesenchyme of the
fetal mammary gland, and the testosterone produced by
the testes in male fetuses causes the mesenchyme to con-
dense around the epithelium, detaching the epithelium
from the skin. Thus, the male mice will typically not have
nipples (26, 27). Antiandrogenic compounds can lead to
nipple retention in exposed males (28). Testosterone is
likely to have a physiological role during postnatal de-
velopment of the female gland because the mammary
glands of female AR knockout mice show impaired ductal
growth in postnatal life, indicating a role in ductal elon-
gation (29). A wide range of EDCs, including several
pharmaceutical compounds, naturally occurring EDCs,
and industrial compounds with varied modes of action,
have been demonstrated to alter the development of the

UOG Chemical Mixtures Disrupt Mouse Mammary Gland
Endocrinology, March 2018, 159(3):1277–1289

 mammary gland, with effects that typically manifest at
puberty and in adulthood, when endogenous hormones
induce its growth (20, 30). The characteristics that are
commonly evaluated to determine the level of development
and the disruption of development by EDCs include a
number of branching points, extension of the ductal epi-
thelium into the stroma, the number and size of termi-
nal end buds (TEBs) (e.g., highly proliferative epithelial
structures present during puberty), and the presence of
alveolar buds and lobuloalveolar units (e.g., structures that
will produce milk in lactating females), among others (31).
Based on the hormone receptor antagonism of the 23-
chemical mixture and the effects this mixture induced in
the endpoints relevant to the hypothalamic-pituitary-
gonadal axis in exposed mice, we hypothesized that
prenatal exposure to the UOG-MIX would disrupt de-
velopment of the mouse mammary gland. We evaluated
the mammary glands in female mice after gestational
exposure to one of four doses of the UOG-MIX. Con-
sistent with our hypothesis, we characterized the sub-
stantial effects of this mixture on mammary gland
morphology in adulthood and documented the presence
of hyperplastic lesions.
Materials and Methods
Animal husbandry and chemical administration
C57BL/6J mice were housed in sterile polysulfone cages
under temperature- and light-controlled (12-hour light, 12-hour
dark) conditions in a barrier animal facility. The mice were fed
LabDiet 5053 and provided acidified water ad libitum from
glass bottles. Ten-week-old mice were mated, and the day of
vaginal plug formation was denoted as gestational day 0. On
gestational day 11, the dams were randomized to the treat-
ment groups and provided with experimental treatment in their
drinking water. The test concentrations included a 0.2% etha-
nol vehicle; flutamide, a known antiandrogenic pharmaceutical
agent (mechanistic antiandrogen control, 167 mg/mL); and four
concentrations of the 23-chemical mixture (UOG-MIX), with each
individual chemical present at 0.01, 0.10, 1.0, and 10 mg/mL. The
composition of the chemical mixture and hormone recep-
tor antagonist activity are listed in Table 1. Water intake was
monitored by weighing the drinking water bottle every day of the
experiment. Based on intake, the chemical exposure was esti-
mated at 3, 30, 300, or 3000 mg/kg body weight/d for the
mixtures. These treatment groups are referred to as MIX-3, MIX-
30, MIX-300, and MIX-3000, respectively. Intake of the anti-
androgenic control was estimated at 50 mg flutamide/kg body
weight/d. Water intake did not differ in experimental groups
relative to the vehicle control (data not shown). Experimental
treatment was provided until birth; the dams were then reverted
to standard acidified water when the pups were first detected.
Litters with ,2 males and females were removed from the an-
alyses owing to concerns of gestational hormone exposure.
Litters with .2 males and females were left unaltered, because
culling within litters has been shown to alter the feeding, be-
havior, and physiology of the remaining pups (32).
All experimental procedures were performed according to an
approved University of Missouri Animal Care and Use Com-
mittee protocol and were in accordance with the National
Research Council’s Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory
Animals.
Tissue collection
All mice were euthanized by carbon dioxide asphyxiation
and cardiac puncture, and the mammary tissues were excised.
One randomly selected female pup from each litter underwent
necropsy on either postnatal day (PND) 21 or PND85. At both
ages, one fourth of the inguinal mammary gland was whole
mounted on a glass slide, fixed in neutral-buffered formalin
overnight, and processed for carmine staining using proto-
cols described previously (33). Whole mounts were preserved in
K-pax sealed bags with methyl salicylate. The contralateral
fourth inguinal mammary gland was formalin-fixed for 24
hours, washed in phosphate-buffered saline, and stored in 70%
ethanol for histological evaluation.
Morphological analysis of whole mount
mammary glands
Whole mount specimens were imaged using a Zeiss dissecting
microscope with AxioCam HRc digital camera. For analyses of
the prepubertal mammary gland (PND21), images were captured
of the full ductal tree and its position relative to the central lymph
node. The following measurements were taken using methods
developed previously (33): total ductal area, measured by
quantifying the area subtended by the ducts; ductal extension,
quantified as the furthest growth of the ductal tree measured from
the center of the lymph node; and the number of branching
points, counted throughout the entire gland. No mice had visible
TEBs; thus, these structures were not quantified.
For analyses of the adult gland, two photographs were taken,
one of the entire mammary gland (at 33 magnification) and
one anterior to the central lymph node (at 313.5 magnifica-
tion); the former was used to evaluate the presence of TEB-like
structures and the latter for unbiased stereological evaluations
using ZEN imaging software (Zeiss). In brief, to quantify the
volume fraction of epithelial structures, a 130-point grid was
superimposed over each anterior photograph. The structure
present on each crosshair was counted; the individual epithe-
lial structures that were evaluated included ducts (when the
crosshair hit the middle of a duct), terminal ducts/terminal ends
(when the crosshair hit a blunt end of a duct), and alveolar buds
(34). The volume fraction of each type of structure was cal-
culated by counting the number of crosshairs that hit each
structure divided by the total number of crosshairs hitting the
mammary tissue (typically, 130). Volume fraction of all epi-
thelium was calculated by summing all epithelial structures (i.e.,
ducts, terminal ends, and alveolar buds).
Excision of mammary tissue from whole mounts
For whole mounts that displayed unusual or TEB-like
structures, small areas of the gland, including these abnormal
structures, were excised using a scalpel and dissecting micro-
scope. The remainder of the whole mount was then rebagged
using methyl salicylate. The excised parts of the whole mounts
were washed, processed through a series of alcohols, embedded
in paraffin, and sectioned using the methods described in the

 following sections. Additional areas from the whole mount
specimens with a normal appearance were also excised for use as
control tissues. All excised tissues were coded such that addi-
tional analyses could be conducted by experimenters who were
unaware of their origin (e.g., unusual vs normal).
Histological evaluation
One mammary gland from each sample was processed
through a series of dehydrating alcohol washes and embedded in
paraffin under vacuum; 5-mm sections were produced using a
rotary microtome and placed on Superfrost positively charged
slides (Fisher Scientific). This process was also used to evalu-
ate excised tissue from whole mount mammary glands. For the
histological evaluations, the sections were deparaffinized in
xylene and rehydrated in a series of alcohol washes. They were
then stained using Harris hematoxylin and eosin (Fisher Scientific),
dehydrated through an alcohol series, washed in xylene, and
mounted using a permanent mounting medium (Fisher Scientific).
The slides were examined using a Zeiss Observer Z1 inverted light
microscope at 340 magnification. Images were captured using an
AxioCam HRc digital camera and evaluated with ZEN imaging
software (Zeiss) for the presence of hyperplastic ducts.
Immunohistochemistry
Immunohistochemical analysis for ERa and Ki67, a marker
of proliferation, was performed as previously described (34).
Primary antibodies were used at 1:1000 (ERa; catalog no. 06-
935; Millipore; Ki67; catalog no. 9106-S1; Thermo Fisher
Scientific; Table 2). For feasibility, the samples were examined
in the control, MIX-3, and MIX-3000 groups only; these groups
were selected to evaluate a wide range of doses. The samples
were visualized using a Zeiss Observer Z1 inverted light mi-
croscope at 340 magnification, and the images were captured
using an AxioCam HRc digital camera. The images were an-
alyzed using ZEN imaging software (Zeiss). For each sample,
two or three fields of view were selected arbitrarily (depending
on the size of the epithelial ducts) and imaged at 340; the
expression of each marker was quantified in all ducts within
these images. At least 200 epithelial cells were assessed for each
antigen; each cell was counted as either positively expressing the
marker of interest (brown owing to diaminobenzidine, the
colorimetric reaction used to visualize immunohistochemical
reactions), or no expression (blue; hematoxylin counterstain).
Terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated
dUTP nick end labeling assay
The Trevigen TACS 2 TdT-DAB in situ apoptosis detection
kit was used for detection of apoptotic cells in the mammary
tissue sections. All samples were counterstained with Harris
hematoxylin, dehydrated, mounted with a permanent mounting
medium, and imaged with a Zeiss Observer Z1 inverted light
microscope at 340 magnification. Quantification of terminal
deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling
(TUNEL) was completed in two or three fields of view selected
arbitrarily; all ducts within these images were evaluated. At least
200 epithelial cells were assessed; each cell was counted as either
TUNEL-positive (brown owing to diaminobenzidine, the col-
orimetric reaction used to visualize the TUNEL reactions) or no
expression (blue; hematoxylin counterstain).
Statistical analysis
The SPSS statistical software package, version 22 (IBM
Corp.), was used for all statistical analyses. Analysis of variance
followed by Fisher post hoc tests, was used to assess for dif-
ferences between the control and UOG-MIX treatment groups
for each age (PND21 and PND85). Independent samples t tests
were used to compare the control and flutamide-treated groups
(35). A x2 test was performed to compare the incidence of
hyperplasia in the mammary gland epithelium of control and
UOG-MIX–exposed mice. To account for litter effects, only 1
mouse was selected from each litter for each age evaluated. For
all statistical tests, the results were considered statistically sig-
nificant at P , 0.05. All results are presented as the mean 6
standard error of the mean and were collected and analyzed by
experimenters who were unaware of the treatment.
Results
Prepubertal mammary gland morphology was not
altered by developmental exposure to UOG-MIX
The mice were exposed to vehicle or one of four doses
of a 23-chemical mixture (UOG-MIX) during gestation.
To determine the effects of the UOG chemicals on the
female prepubertal mammary gland, morphological
evaluations were first conducted at PND21. TEBs were
not present in any glands from any treatment group,
consistent with the prepubertal stage of mammary gland
development (Fig. 1A; data not shown). Morphometric
evaluations revealed an inverse association between
treatment and total ductal area (e.g., smaller epithelial
trees in UOG-MIX–treated females), although no sta-
tistically significant differences were found in this growth
parameter between controls and the UOG-MIX treat-
ments (Fig. 1B). Flutamide-treated females had signifi-
cantly smaller ductal trees compared with the controls

UOG Chemical Mixtures Disrupt Mouse Mammary Gland
Endocrinology, March 2018, 159(3):1277–1289

 (P , 0.05; independent samples t test; Fig. 1B). Ductal
extension and the total number of branching points were
not different in any treatment group, including the
flutamide-treated females (Table 3). Collectively, these
data suggest that prenatal exposure to the 23-chemical
mixture did not alter the morphological features of the
female mammary glands before puberty.
Adult mammary gland morphology was altered by
developmental exposure to UOG chemical mixtures
Increased volume of ducts and epithelial
compartment
Unbiased stereological methods revealed treatment-
related effects on mammary gland morphology in early
adulthood (PND85; Fig. 2A). Females exposed to MIX-
300 had significantly more ducts compared with vehicle-
treated controls (P , 0.05, Fisher post hoc test; Fig. 2A
and 2B), and a trend for an increase was also seen in
females exposed to MIX-30 and MIX-3000 (P , 0.1,
Fisher post hoc test; Fig. 2A and 2B). The volume
fraction of total mammary epithelium was significantly
increased in females exposed to MIX-300 and MIX-
3000 (P , 0.05, Fisher post hoc test; Fig. 2A and
2C). Neither of these parameters were significantly al-
tered by flutamide treatment. Alveolar buds were not
observed in females of any treatment group (Fig. 2A;
data not shown).
Increased proliferation/apoptosis ratio
The growth of the mammary epithelium is dependent
on a balance of proliferation (to extend ductal structures
into the mammary fat pad) and apoptosis (to produce
hollow ducts capable of transporting milk) (36). To
quantify apoptosis in the epithelium of the adult fe-
male mammary glands, TUNEL staining was used to
compare the controls, MIX-3, MIX-3000, and flutamide-
treated mice. No statistically significant changes in
TUNEL incorporation were seen in MIX-3 and MIX-
3000 females (Fig. 3A and 3B). A borderline statistically
significant decrease was seen in TUNEL-positive cells in
the flutamide-treated group (P = 0.052, independent
samples t test; Fig. 3B).
We next evaluated proliferation in the mammary
epithelium using antibodies for Ki67, a marker of pro-
liferation. Although the proliferation levels were low, as
expected for adult mammary glands, we observed sta-
tistically significant effects of the 23-chemical mixture on
the number of cells expressing Ki67 in the MIX-3 group
(P , 0.05; Fisher post hoc test; Fig. 3A and 3C). Females

 from the MIX-3 group had 427% more Ki67-positive
cells compared with the controls. The MIX-3000 treat-
ment group had 54% more Ki67-positive cells compared
with the controls, although these differences were not
statistically significant. Ki67 expression was not altered
by the use of flutamide (Fig. 3C).
We evaluated the ratio of proliferation/apoptosis in
the control, MIX-3, MIX-3000, and flutamide-treated
females. We found a striking 397% increase in the
proliferation/apoptosis ratio in the MIX-3 treatment
group (P , 0.05; Fisher post hoc test) and nonsignificant
increases in the MIX-3000 group (131%) compared with
the controls (Fig. 3D). No effect on the proliferation/
apoptosis ratio was observed in the flutamide-treated
females (Fig. 3D).
ERa expression tended to be associated with
developmental UOG-MIX treatment
EDCs have been shown to not only bind to hormone
receptors, but also to alter expression of hormone re-
ceptors in a dose-, age-, and tissue-specific manner (37).
We next asked whether developmental exposure to
fracking chemicals would alter expression of ERa in the
mammary epithelium. We observed a general increase
in ERa expression with an increasing UOG-MIX dose,
although these differences were not statistically sig-
nificant (Fig. 3A and 3E). Flutamide also did not af-
fect the percentage of epithelial cells expressing ERa
(Fig. 3E).
TEB-like intraductal hyperplasia in mammary glands
after developmental mix treatment
A striking observation made during the morphological
assessment of the adult (PND85) mammary glands was
the appearance of structures that resembled TEBs (Fig. 4).
These TEB-like structures were not observed in the
control females (Table 4). The unusual structures were
excised from whole mount mammary glands and further
characterized using histological and immunohistochem-
istry tools (Fig. 5). Hematoxylin and eosin staining
revealed ducts with excessive layers of epithelial cells,
consistent with intraductal hyperplasia (Fig. 5A). These
TEB-like lesions were highly proliferative: .40% of
epithelial cells in lesions were Ki67-positive compared
with ,4% of epithelial cells in normal ducts collected
from the same mice or ducts excised from control females
(Fig. 5A and 5B). ERa expression was also greater in
many, although not all, of the excised lesions (Fig. 5A and
5C). Collectively, these results suggest that the retained
TEB-like structures are highly proliferative intraductal
hyperplasias that are likely to be estrogen-responsive.
Discussion
We examined the effects of exposure to a mixture of 23
chemicals used in unconventional oil and gas extraction,
most of which were previously shown to exhibit antag-
onistic properties on one or more hormone receptors

 receptor, and AR. Also, 21, 20, and 11 of these chemicals
were previously demonstrated to antagonize human ER,
AR, and PR, respectively, in a reporter gene assay in
human endometrial cells (summarized in Table 1). To the
best of our knowledge, we have shown for the first time
that the mouse mammary gland is sensitive to develop-
mental UOG-MIX exposure, with dose-specific effects on
tissue morphology (after exposure to MIX-300 and
MIX-3000), cell proliferation (after exposure to MIX-3),
and the induction of unique intraductal hyperplasias

 (observed in all MIX groups). The effects observed in the
present study occurred at low doses; the two lowest dose
groups (MIX-3 and MIX-30) are equivalent to the
concentrations measured in drinking water in regions
experiencing drilling and the highest dose group (MIX-
3000) is equivalent to the concentrations of many UOG-
MIX components measured in industry wastewater (4,
13, 18, 38). In addition, the concentrations for several of
the 23 chemicals in the UOG-MIX used in the present
study have not yet been determined in either drinking
water or wastewater.
The mammary gland is a hormone-sensitive organ that
is responsive to multiple endocrine inputs during early
development. Testosterone has a unique role in estab-
lishing the sexually dimorphic development of the mouse
mammary gland (26, 27) but is not thought to play a role
in the female or postnatally. AR expression remains high
in the mammary stroma until birth (26, 39), suggesting
that UOG-MIX exposure could affect mammary devel-
opment via actions at the AR. Although some endpoints
were similarly affected (e.g., retention of TEBs), other
effects of UOG-MIX exposure we observed in the present
study were distinct from the effects of flutamide, sug-
gesting that the UOG mixture might not working through
an antiandrogenic mechanism as we originally hypoth-
esized. To date, few studies have evaluated the effects of
prenatal exposures to antiandrogenic chemicals on the
female mammary gland; most studies of antiandrogens
have examined their effects on male offspring, including
nipple retention and other disruptions to mammary gland
morphology [reviewed in (40–42)]. These studies sug-
gested that evaluations of mammary glands in male mice

 exposed to UOG mixtures are a priority. A better
mechanistic understanding of the effects of AR antago-
nists on the female mammary gland, including a wider
range of exposure to flutamide, is also needed.
Previous studies of other EDCs have shown few effects
on the female gland before puberty (33, 43), suggesting
that the most obvious effects of EDCs manifest visibly
only after the onset of ovarian hormone production. In
support of this, we observed striking effects of develop-
mental exposure to UOG chemical mixtures in the adult
female mammary gland (at PND85). Not only were
mammary glands more developed in the UOG-MIX–
treated adult females, as indicated by the increased vol-
ume fraction of epithelium (Fig. 2), but UOG-MIX

 treatment also altered the ratios of proliferation and
apoptosis (Fig. 3), cell parameters important for dictating
the growth and function of the mammary gland (33, 44,
45). Normal growth of the mammary epithelium is de-
pendent on a balance of proliferation (to extend ductal
structures into the mammary fat pad) and apoptosis
(to produce hollow ducts capable of transporting milk)
(36); thus, disruptions to these cellular features could
predispose animals to mammary gland diseases (e.g.,
cancer) or abnormal function (e.g., disruptions to lac-
tation). Additional studies are needed to evaluate these
outcomes in UOG-MIX–treated females. The substantial
alterations to the apoptosis/proliferation ratio suggest
that the mammary glands from UOG-MIX–treated fe-
males might continue to manifest complex hyperplastic
and preneoplastic lesions in later adulthood. Additional
studies are needed to evaluate this possibility.
We were also surprised to see TEB-like hyperplastic
lesions in the mammary glands collected from mice in the
UOG-MIX–treatment groups, as well as in the flutamide-
treated mice (Fig. 4). Other EDCs have also been shown
to induce development of intraductal hyperplasias, al-
though these typically will have a “beaded duct,” rather
than a TEB-like, appearance (34, 46, 47). TEBs are a
characteristic structure of glands undergoing puberty (45,
48); these highly proliferative structures drive the growth
of the mammary epithelium into the surrounding fat pad.
Once the epithelial tree is fully formed, the TEB structures
recede and are not seen in adult glands (19, 49). One
possibility is that UOG-MIX exposure during early life
delays the appearance of TEBs, and thus their presence in
the glands of adult mice is indicative of a shift in the
timing of puberty. Although the timing of vaginal
opening and the age of first vaginal estrus were not af-
fected by UOG-MIX exposure (18), the timing of pu-
bertal growth in the mammary gland involves distinct
events (50). Alternatively, it is possible that the timing of
mammary puberty is unaffected by UOG-MIX exposure
and that the retention of TEBs is indicative of failure to
progress to blunt ductal ends. Thus, the presence of TEBs
could be interpreted as diminished development of the
mammary gland in UOG-MIX–treated groups, in con-
trast to the effects of these chemical mixtures on epithelial
density, which are more consistent with advanced de-
velopment of the gland (Fig. 2). EDCs have previously
been shown to produce competing effects on growth
parameters in the mammary gland, including some that
advance one aspect of development and seem to delay
other developmental landmarks (51). Studies of bisphe-
nol A, for example, have shown that developmental
exposure can both decrease ductal extension (growth)
and increase the size of TEBs (33, 44, 52–54). These
results are consistent with the two competing roles that
hormones such as estrogen can have in the developing
gland, including its ability to promote proliferation of
some mammary epithelial cells and inducing apoptosis of
other mammary epithelial cells inside the duct, allowing
the lumen to form (55, 56). TEBs are one of the sites
where cancers are thought to arise; thus, delays in TEB
recession could increase the gland’s sensitivity to car-
cinogens (51, 57). Future studies are needed to determine
whether these TEBs are retained into later adulthood
and whether prenatal UOG-MIX exposure increases the
sensitivity of the gland to carcinogens.
The mammary gland provides an in vivo tool to
evaluate the effects of EDCs with different modes of
action, including chemicals administered as mixtures. To
date, in vivo studies of EDC chemical mixtures have been
limited, with even fewer studies examining mammals
[examples include (58–60)]. The results from in vitro
studies have suggested that compounds with a similar
mode of action can have additive effects, including some
xenoestrogen mixtures, which have been described as
producing “something from nothing” (61–63). In the
present study, the assessment of the mixture of 23
chemicals in human endometrial cells demonstrated
synergistic responses for ER and thyroid receptor an-
tagonism and less than additive effects for AR and glu-
cocorticoid receptor antagonism (13). Other groups have
found that the toxic effects of pesticides are compounded
when examined as formulations compared with studying
only the so-called active ingredient (64), suggesting that
novel insights can be gained from examining chemical
mixtures that would not be detected, or even anticipated,
from examining the mixture’s components individually.
Concerns have been raised that any effects observed after
exposure to mixtures will be difficult to evaluate mech-
anistically because they cannot be attributed to any single
component of the chemical mixture unless all individual
components are also evaluated. However, it is worth
noting that humans are exposed to chemical mixtures,
rather than single compounds; thus, the study of mix-
tures in laboratory animals might provide better un-
derstanding of the human condition (65).
To date, .1000 different chemicals have been re-
ported for use during unconventional oil and gas ex-
traction (5). Previous studies have shown that prenatal
exposure to this same 23-chemical mixture induced ad-
verse health outcomes in the male offspring (the brothers
of the female mice examined in the present study) (13).
Furthermore, other endocrine organs were affected in
the female mice examined in the present study, in addition
to alterations to serum hormone concentrations, includ-
ing decreased levels of the pituitary hormones luteinizing
hormone, prolactin, and follicle-stimulating hormone,
among others (18). Decreased pituitary hormone

 concentrations could influence mammary gland health,
including the development of the gland during preg-
nancy, an endpoint that deserves future attention.
Determining whether mixtures of fracking chemicals
affect human populations is an important goal, especially
as the number of drilling sites continues to increase (66).
A recent systematic review evaluating the strength of the
data for the association between conventional oil and gas
and UOG operations and human reproductive outcomes
found moderate evidence for an increased risk of preterm
birth, miscarriage, birth defects, decreased semen quality,
and prostate cancer (67). The evidence for an association
between UOG operations and breast cancer, or other
diseases of the breast, remains inadequate. The results
from our study suggest that longitudinal studies evalu-
ating women exposed to UOG chemical mixtures during
early life are needed to address this data gap.
Conclusion
Future studies are needed to evaluate the many additional
chemicals used in, and produced by, UOG processes to
better quantify the concentrations of these and other
contaminants in environmental samples and to assess the
effects of exposure during other sensitive windows of
development, including pregnancy and lactation, pu-
berty, and the aging female. Future studies should also
evaluate whether developmental UOG-MIX treatments
can sensitize animals to hormones or carcinogens, as
would be expected in females with retained TEBs. For
mechanistic insights, additional examination of some
of the individual components in the fracking chemical
mixture might be warranted.
