IMPORTANCE Large improvements in the control of risk factors for cardiovascular disease
have been achieved in the United States, but it remains unclear whether adults in all
socioeconomic strata have benefited equally.
OBJECTIVE To assess temporal trends in 10-year predicted absolute cardiovascular risk and
cardiovascular risk factors among US adults in different socioeconomic strata.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A cross-sectional analysis was conducted using data on
adults 40 to 79 years of age without established cardiovascular disease from the 1999 to
2014 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey.
EXPOSURES Socioeconomic status was based on the family income to poverty ratio and
participants were divided into the following 3 groups: high income (family income to poverty
ratio, �4), middle income (>1 and <4), or at or below the federal poverty level (�1).
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES We assessed predicted absolute cardiovascular risk using
the pooled cohort equation. We assessed the following 4 risk factors: systolic blood pressure,
smoking status, diabetes, and total cholesterol.
RESULTS Of the 17 199 adults whose data were included in the study (8828 women and 8371
men; mean age, 54.4 years), from 1999-2014, trends in the percentage of adults with
predicted absolute cardiovascular risk of 20% or more, mean systolic blood pressure, and the
percentage of current smokers varied by income strata (P � .02 for interaction). For adults
with incomes at or below the federal poverty level, there was little evidence of a change in
any of these outcomes across survey years (cardiovascular risk �20%, 14.9% [95% CI,
12.9%-16.8%] in 1999-2004; 16.5% [95% CI, 13.7%-19.2%] in 2011-2014; P = .41; mean
systolic blood pressure, 127.6 [95% CI, 126.1-129.0] mm Hg in 1999-2004; 126.8 [95% CI,
125.2-128.5] mm Hg in 2011-2014; P = .44; and smoking, 36.5% [95% CI, 32.1%-41.0%] in
1999-2004; 36.0% [95% CI, 31.1%-40.8%] in 2011-2014; P = .87). For adults in the
high-income stratum, these variables decreased across survey years (cardiovascular risk
�20%, 12.0% [95% CI, 10.7%-13.3%] in 1999-2004; 9.5% [95% CI, 8.2%-10.7%] in
2011-2014; P = .003; systolic blood pressure, 126.0 [95% CI, 125.0-126.9] mm Hg in
1999-2004; 122.3 [95% CI, 121.3-123.3] mm Hg in 2011-2014; P < .001; and smoking, 14.1%
[95% CI, 12.0%-16.2%] in 1999-2004; 8.8% [95% CI, 6.6%-11.0%] in 2011-2014; P = .001).
Trends in the percentage of adults with diabetes and the mean total cholesterol level did not
vary by income.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Adults in each socioeconomic stratum have not benefited
equally from efforts to control cardiovascular risk factors.

 C
ardiovascular disease (CVD) is a leading cause of mor-
bidity and mortality in the United States.1 Reducing the
incidence of CVD is therefore a public health priority
and is focused on the management of the leading risk factors
for CVD, including hypertension, smoking, diabetes, and el-
evated cholesterol levels.2 Although large reductions in CVD
risk factors have been achieved in the United States during the
past 2 decades,3-8 it remains unclear whether adults in differ-
ent socioeconomic strata have benefited equally from this re-
duction of risk factors.
To our knowledge, only 1 study has compared national
trends in CVD risk factor prevalence among adults in differ-
ent socioeconomic strata.9 These authors pooled data from na-
tionally representative surveys in the United States between
1971 and 2002 and noted a higher burden of CVD risk factors
inlower-socioeconomicgroups.9Althoughthesefindingswere
important, the analysis is dated, and may not reflect current
socioeconomic disparities. Furthermore, the earlier analysis
focused on individual CVD risk factors, whereas contempo-
rary guidelines recommend an assessment of absolute cardio-
vascular risk.10 The composite effect of changes in the indi-
vidual risk factors therefore remains unclear.
Accordingly, the primary objective of this study was to
assess temporal trends in 10-year predicted absolute cardio-
vascular risk11 among adults in 3 socioeconomic strata in the
United States: adults with incomes at or below the federal pov-
erty level, middle-income adults, and high-income adults. We
also assessed trends in each of the cardiovascular risk factors
contributing to cardiovascular risk prediction: systolic blood
pressure (SBP), smoking, diabetes, and cholesterol.
Methods
Study Sample
The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES) is a cross-sectional survey conducted by the US
National Center for Health Statistics. The survey provides
demographic and laboratory data on a representative sample
of civilian noninstitutionalized US residents. For the pur-
poses of this study, we obtained and merged publicly avail-
able data sets from the NHANES 1999 to 2014 surveys into the
following 3 groups: 1999-2004, 2005-2010, and 2011-2014 to
allow for sufficient sample sizes within each group.12 The
NHANES procedures were approved by the National Centre for
Health Statistics Research Ethics Review Board. Participants
provided written informed consent.
Definitions and Measurements
All nonpregnant adults 40 to 79 years of age were included in
this study in accordance with the original age limits used to
derive the pooled cohort equation (PCE), our selected equa-
tion for estimating absolute cardiovascular risk. Participants’
demographic details including age, race/ethnicity, sex, insur-
ance status, and educational level were self-reported.
The exposure variable was socioeconomic status, which
we assessed based on the family income to poverty ratio (PIR).
This ratio reflects annual family income relative to the fed-
eral poverty level, with 1 representing the poverty level, a score
below 1 representing incomes below the poverty level, and a
score above 1 representing incomes above the poverty level.9
The PIR is comparable across survey years because income
thresholds are updated for inflation each year.9 We separated
participants into 3 groups: adults with incomes at or below the
federal poverty level (PIR, ≤1), middle-income adults (PIR, >1
and <4), and high-income adults (PIR, ≥4). We selected the cut-
offs for middle- and high-income adults based on the thresh-
oldsusedinthePatientProtectionAffordableCareAct,inwhich
adultswithaPIRbetween1and4areeligibleforinsurancesub-
sidies, whereas those with a PIR greater than 4 are not eli-
gible for subsidies. We additionally performed analyses strati-
fied by sex (male and female). We refrained from analyses
stratified by race/ethnicity owing to small sample sizes.
The 5 outcome variables were absolute 10-year cardiovas-
cular risk (continuous and binary; <20% vs ≥20%), SBP (con-
tinuous), smoking (binary; yes or no), diabetes (binary; yes or
no), and total cholesterol level (continuous). Details of the pro-
cedureforSBPmeasurementhavebeenpreviouslydescribed.13
Similar to past studies, the first SBP measurement was used if
only 1 measurement was obtained. Subsequent measure-
ments (second, third, and fourth) were averaged according to
NHANES guidelines.13,14 We did not use a threshold for SBP
given uncertainty about the use of SBP targets.15,16 Further-
more, SBP is included in the PCE as a continuous variable.
Participants with diabetes were identified based on self-
report or a hemoglobin A1c level of 6.5% or more (to convert
to proportion of total hemoglobin, multiply by 0.01). Current
smokers were identified based on self-report. Total choles-
terol level was routinely measured in NHANES.
Absolute 10-year risk of cardiovascular events was calcu-
lated using the PCE.11 We excluded participants with a self-
reported history of coronary artery disease, angina, acute
myocardial infarction, stroke, or congestive heart failure, con-
sistent with the derivation cohort. Medication records pro-
vided by NHANES were used to determine whether partici-
pants were treated for hypertension. The percentage of adults
with a predicted cardiovascular risk of 20% or more and av-
erage cardiovascular risk (continuous) were the outcomes of
interest.
Key Points
Question Are there socioeconomic disparities in 10-year
predicted absolute cardiovascular disease risk and individual risk
factors (systolic blood pressure, smoking, diabetes, and total
cholesterol) among US adults?
Findings In this analysis of 17 199 adults without established
cardiovascular disease, the percentage of adults with predicted
cardiovascular disease risk of 20% or more, mean systolic blood
pressure, and the percentage of current smokers declined among
adults in the high-income stratum, but there was little evidence of
a change among adults with incomes at or below the federal
poverty level. The trend in diabetes and cholesterol level did not
vary by income.
Meaning Adults in each socioeconomic stratum have not benefited
equally from efforts to improve control of cardiovascular risk factors.

 Statistical Analysis
No variables had more than 10% of values missing; therefore,
missing values were treated with casewise deletion, which is
unlikely to introduce bias in a complete case analysis.17 Bi-
nary variables were summarized using weighted percentages
and 95% CIs. Continuous variables were summarized using
means and 95% CIs. Estimates were age standardized to the
year 2000 population of adults 40 to 79 years of age without
established CVD using the direct standardization method. The
percentages used were 0.405 for adults 40 to 49 years of age,
0.272 for adults 50 to 59 years of age, 0.193 for adults 60 to
69 years of age, and 0.130 for adults 70 to 79 years of age.
We examined trends using linear regression or logistic re-
gression as appropriate. The dependent variable was binary for
predicted cardiovascular risk (<20% vs ≥20%), presence of dia-
betes, and current smoking. Mean predicted cardiovascular
risk, total cholesterol level, and SBP were assessed as continu-
ousvariables.Theprimarypredictorvariablesweresurveyyear
(continuous) and income strata (categorical). The model in-
cluded adjustment for age, sex, and race/ethnicity (categori-
cal). Sex-stratified analyses were adjusted for age and race/
ethnicity. We assessed for an interaction between survey year
and income strata. If there was no statistically significant in-
teraction, we examined trends across survey years for all par-
ticipants, without consideration of income strata. We also ex-
amined trends across income strata.
If a statistically significant interaction between income
strata and survey year was found, we examined trends across
survey years for each income stratum separately. We also as-
sessed pairwise differences between the adults at or below the
federal poverty level and high-income adults in each survey
period (1999-2004, 2005-2010, and 2011-2014). We specifi-
cally focused on the pairwise comparison between adults at
or below the poverty level and high-income adults because we
expected that any clinically meaningful differences between
groups would be evident from this comparison. Also, this ap-
proach avoided the need for adjustment for multiple compari-
sons if all possible pairwise comparisons were examined.
Finally, given that our study identified a statistically sig-
nificant interaction between survey year and income strata for
predicted cardiovascular risk, SBP, and smoking, we con-
ducted an exploratory analysis in which we included variables
for educational level (college vs not college) and health insur-
ance (yes vs no) in the regression model to determine whether
the interaction term would remain statistically significant.
Statistical analyses were conducted using Stata, version
14 (StataCorp). Sample weights, which account for over-
sampling, survey nonresponse, and poststratification, were
used to derive all estimates. P < .05 was used as the threshold
for statistical significance for any tests for interaction or tests
for trend.
Results
From 1999 to 2014, NHANES included 17 199 adults who were
between 40 and 79 years of age, without established CVD, with
a PIR and sufficient laboratory data to calculate absolute CVD
risk. The general characteristics of these adults are detailed
in the Table. The mean (95% CI) age of study participants in-
creased marginally across survey years (1999-2004, 53.7 [53.3-
54.1] years; 2005-2010, 54.4 [53.9-54.8] years; and 2011-

Hispanic white adults decreased (1999-2004, 77.0%; 2005-
2010, 75.9%; and 2011-2014, 72.1%). Finally, the percentage
of men and women and the percentage of adults within each
income stratum was consistent across survey years.
Ten-Year Predicted Absolute Cardiovascular Risk
Overall, the percentage of adults with predicted cardiovascu-
lar risk of 20% or more decreased across survey years (1999-
2004, 13.1% [95% CI, 12.3%-14.0%]; 2011-2014, 11.5% [95% CI,
10.6%-12.4%]; P = .001) and the trend varied by income strata
(P = .02 for interaction between high income vs at or below the
federal poverty level; Figure 1 and eTable 1 in the Supple-
ment).Acrosssurveyyears,therewaslittleevidenceofachange
in the percentage of adults with cardiovascular risk of 20% or
more for those with incomes at or below the federal poverty
level(14.9%[95%CI,12.9%-16.8%]in1999-2004to16.5%[95%
CI, 13.7%-19.2%] in 2011-2014; P = .41), but there was a de-
crease for adults in the middle-income stratum (13.8% [95%
CI, 12.5%-15.1%] to 12.2% [95% CI, 11.2%-13.1%]; P = .02) and
thehigh-incomestratum(12.0%[95%CI,10.7%-13.3%]to9.5%
[95% CI, 8.2%-10.7%]; P = .003). In each survey year, the per-
centageofadultswithcardiovascularriskof20%orgreaterwas
lower among high-income adults compared with adults with
incomes at or below the federal poverty level.
With respect to analyses stratified by sex, there was a sta-
tistically significant interaction for cardiovascular risk across
survey years and income strata for men (P = .009 for interac-
tion). From 1999 to 2014, there was a small numerical in-
creaseinthepercentageofmenwithcardiovascularriskof20%
or greater for those with incomes at or below the federal pov-
erty level (1999-2004, 18.3% [95% CI, 16.0%-20.5%]; 2011-
2014, 22.7% [95% CI, 17.2%-28.1%]; P = .04; Figure 2). In con-
trast, there was also little evidence of a change for men in the
middle-income stratum (1999-2004, 21.1% [95% CI, 19.0%-
23.1%]; 2011-2014, 18.6% [95% CI, 16.8%-20.5%]; P = .06), but

11.9%-16.6%]; P = .04). In survey years 2005-2010 and 2011-
2014,thepercentageofadultswithacardiovascularriskof20%
or greater was lower among high-income men compared with
men with incomes at or below the poverty level. For women,
there was no statistically significant interaction for predicted
cardiovascular risk across survey years and income strata
(P = .65; Figure 2). However, the percentage of women with a
cardiovascular risk of 20% or more decreased across survey
years (pooled across all income strata: 1999-2004, 8.7% [95%
CI,7.9%-9.6%];2011-2014,7.1%[95%CI,6.2%-8.1%];P = .009),
anditwasinverselyassociatedwithincomelevel(pooledacross

12.3% [95% CI, 11.0%-13.7%] in adults with incomes at or be-
low the federal poverty level; P < .001).
The mean predicted cardiovascular risk (as a continuous
variable)decreasedacrosssurveyyears(1999-2004,9.0%[95%
CI,8.7%-9.2%];2011-2014,8.5%[95%CI,8.1%-8.7%];P < .001),
but the trend did not vary by income strata (P = .81 for inter-
action). With respect to between-group differences, the mean
predicted cardiovascular risk was also higher in high-income
adults compared with adults with incomes at or below the pov-
erty level (7.7% [95% CI, 7.5%-7.9%] in high-income adults;
10.4% [95% CI, 10.0%-10.8%] in adults with incomes at or
below the federal poverty level; P < .001). There was no sta-
tistically significant interaction for either men or women.

for men with incomes at or below the poverty level (1999-

crease in the mean SBP for men in the high-income stratum
(1999-2004, 125.9 mm Hg [95% CI, 124.5-127.4]; 2011-2014,

among high-income men compared with men with incomes
at or below the poverty level. There was no statistically sig-
nificant interaction between survey year and income strata for
women (P = .24 for interaction; Figure 2). However, SBP de-
creased across survey years (pooled across all income strata:

adults; 126.2 mm Hg [95% CI, 125.1-127.2] in adults with in-

Smoking
Trends in the percentage of current smokers varied by in-
come strata (P = .02 for interaction). From 1999 to 2014, there
was little evidence of a change in the percentage of current
smokers for adults with incomes at or below the federal pov-
erty level (36.5% [95% CI, 32.1%-41.0%] to 36.0% [95%
CI, 31.1%-40.8%]; P = .87; Figure 1 and eTable 1 in the Supple-
ment). There was also little evidence of a change in the per-
centage of current smokers for adults in the middle-income
stratum(23.9%[95%CI,21.6%-26.2%]to24.0%[95%CI,21.1%-
26.9%]; P = .62), but there was a decrease for those in the high-
income stratum (14.1% [95% CI, 12.0%-16.2%] to 8.8% [95%

For men and women, there was little evidence of a statis-

Diabetes and Total Cholesterol
Overall,thepercentageofadultswithdiabetesincreasedacross
survey years (Figure 3 and eTable 1 in the Supplement), but the
trend did not vary by income strata (P = .94 for interaction).
The percentage of adults with diabetes was highest among
adults with incomes at or below the poverty level and was low-
est among adults in the high-income stratum (Figure 3 and
eTable 1 in the Supplement). There was also no statistically sig-
nificant interaction for either men or women (Figure 4).
Likewise,themeantotalcholesterolleveldecreasedacross
survey years (Figure 3 and eTable 1 in the Supplement), but the
trend did not vary by income strata (P = .44 for interaction).
The mean total cholesterol did not vary by income strata
(Figure 3 and eTable 1 in the Supplement). There was also no
statistically significant interaction for either men or women
(Figure 4).
Exploratory Analyses
In exploratory analyses, educational level and health in-
surance were included in regression models for predicted
absolute cardiovascular risk, mean SBP, and percentage of
current smokers. The trend in the percentage of these out-
comes continued to vary by income strata (P ≤ .01 for interac-
tion for both cardiovascular risk and SBP; P = .048 for inter-
action for smoking). The regression coefficients comparing
adults in the high-income stratum with adults with incomes
at or below the poverty level changed minimally (eTable 2 in
the Supplement).
Discussion
This study provides a detailed analysis of income disparities
intrendsofabsolutecardiovascularriskandcardiovascularrisk
factors among US adults. From 1999 to 2014, we found that
the percentage of adults with predicted cardiovascular risk of
20% or greater, mean SBP, and the percentage of current smok-
ers declined in adults in the high-income stratum but re-
mained unchanged in adults with incomes at or below the fed-
eral poverty level. The trend in diabetes and cholesterol level
didnotvarybyincome.Takentogether,recentgainsinthecon-
trol of cardiovascular risk factors in the United States have not
benefited adults in all socioeconomic strata equally.
Important shifts in the association between income and
mortality have been noted in recent studies of US adults.18 A
large study of 1.4 billion tax records from 1999 to 2014 dem-
onstrated that adults with higher incomes had greater life ex-
pectancy and the gap in life expectancy between the richest
5% and the poorest 5% of adults increased over time.18 There
was also county-level variation in the mortality rate among
adults in the low-income stratum, which was strongly corre-
lated with smoking rates but not with access to medical care.
Examining trends in cardiovascular risk factors among
adults belonging to different socioeconomic strata is there-
fore an important element of any public health strategy to re-
duce income disparities in morbidity and mortality. It is well

 established that control of cardiovascular risk factors is poorer
in adults with lower incomes.9,19,20 Furthermore, socioeco-
nomic status is associated with cardiovascular events. For in-
stance,Medicarebeneficiariesinlow-incomecountiesaremore
likely to be hospitalized for acute myocardial infarction than
are those in high-income counties.21
However, it is less clear whether the gap in cardiovascu-
lar risk among adults in different income strata has changed
overtime.Toourknowledge,only1studyhascomparedtrends
in control of cardiovascular risk factors in adults in high and
low socioeconomic strata.9 In that study, the authors pooled
data from nationally representative surveys between 1971 and
2002 and noted that the greatest reduction in hypertension
was among adults in the lowest income quartile, whereas the
greatest reduction in high cholesterol levels and smoking was
among adults in the highest income quartile.9 However, the
composite effect of changes in the individual cardiovascular
risk factors remained unclear, as these authors did not assess
predicted absolute cardiovascular risk.
Ourstudyexpandsonthisearlierworkbyexaminingtrends
in cardiovascular risk factors and predicted cardiovascular risk
using contemporary national surveys (1999-2014). In contrast
to the earlier study,9 we noted a consistent pattern in control
of cardiovascular risk factors that largely favored adults in the
highestincomestratum.Wefoundthatthepercentageofadults
with predicted cardiovascular risk of 20% or greater, the mean
SBP, and the percentage of current smokers declined in adults
inthehighestincomestratumbutremainedunchangedinadults
with incomes at or below the federal poverty level. However,
the gap between income strata did not change for diabetes and
cholesterol level. Our analysis was stratified by sex, but these
results should be interpreted with caution owing to the small
sample sizes. Tentatively, our results suggest that the growing
disparity in control of cardiovascular risk factors among
income strata is most pronounced among men.
Reducing the effects of income disparities in blood pres-
sure management and smoking therefore represent an impor-
tant focus for population-level interventions. In our explor-
atory analysis, we found that the interaction term for survey
year and income strata remained statistically significant even
after the inclusion of adult educational level and health insur-
ance in the regression model. Although this finding suggests
that the growing income disparity in SBP and smoking is not
completely explained by differences in educational level and
health insurance, our analysis may not have captured impor-
tant nuances about the mediating role of educational level and
insurance. For example, the relative performance of insur-
ance plans that enroll adults with lower incomes differs from
that of insurance plans that enroll adults with higher in-
comes, which has been shown to contribute to disparities in

may account for the association between income and SBP, in-
cluding obesity, exercise, diet, and psychosocial factors.22
These mediating factors may represent opportunities for pre-
ventive interventions to reduce income disparities in control
of cardiovascular risk factors.23
The prevalence of diabetes increased in all groups exam-
ined in our study, a finding consistent with other recent analy-
ses demonstrating an increasing prevalence of diabetes in the
overall US population.24,25 However, an important finding in
our study was the marked differences in the prevalence of dia-
betes in adults belonging to each income stratum. Given that
cardiovascular risk has not changed in adults with incomes at
or below the federal poverty level, curbing the rise in diabe-
tes in this subgroup is important.
Limitations
Our study has important limitations. First, we performed an
analysis of multiple cross-sectional surveys and cannot estab-
lishacausalassociationbetweenincomeandcardiovascularrisk
factors. Second, SBP was measured on 1 occasion only. Third,
multiplestudiessuggestthatthePCEmayoverestimatetherisk

centage of adults with a predicted cardiovascular risk of 20%
orgreater,butwouldnotalterourfindingsofdifferentialtrends

important cardiovascular risk factors such as body mass in-
dex,glomerularfiltrationrate,physicalactivity,anddiet.These
risk factors were beyond the scope of our study, and body mass
index and glomerular filtration rate did not prognostically im-
prove the PCE.10
Conclusions
Taken together, recent gains in the control of cardiovascular
risk factors in the United States have not benefited adults in
all socioeconomic strata equally. Renewed efforts are re-
quired to reduce income disparities in control of cardiovascu-
lar risk factors.
