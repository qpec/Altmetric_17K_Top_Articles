ABSTRACT:
Objective: Examine relationships among
neurodegenerative biomarkers and PD motor and nonmotor
symptoms.
Background: CSF alpha-synuclein is decreased in PD
versus healthy controls, but whether plasma and saliva
alpha-synuclein differentiate these groups is controver-
sial. Correlations of alpha-synuclein among biofluids (CSF
,
plasma, saliva) or biomarkers (eg, beta-amyloid, tau [total,
phosphorylated]) are not fully understood. The relation-
ships of these biomarkers with PD clinical features remain
unclear.
Methods: BioFIND, a cross-sectional, observational study,
examines
clinical
and
biomarker
characteristics
in
moderate-advanced PD and matched healthy controls. We
compared alpha-synuclein concentrations across diagnosis,
biofluids, and CSF biomarkers. Correlations of CSF bio-
markers and MDS-UPDRS, motor phenotype, MoCA, and
rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder questionnaire
scores in PD were examined.
Results: CSF alpha-synuclein was lower in PD versus
controls (P 5.01), controlling for age, gender, and educa-
tion. Plasma and saliva alpha-synuclein did not differ

 between PD and controls, and alpha-synuclein did not
significantly correlate among biofluids. CSF beta-amy-
loid1-42 was lower in PD versus controls (P <.01), and cor-
related weakly with MoCA recall scores (r 5 0.23, P 5.02).
CSF alpha-synuclein was lower in the postural instability/
gait difficulty phenotype than other motor phenotypes
(P <.01). No CSF biomarkers predicted or correlated with
total motor or rapid eye movement sleep behavior disor-
der scores. CSF alpha-synuclein correlated with beta-
amyloid1-42, total-tau, and phosphorylated-tau (r 5 0.41,
0.81, 0.43, respectively; Ps < .001).
Conclusion: Lower CSF alpha-synuclein is associated
with
diagnosis
and
motor
phenotype
in
moderate-
advanced PD. Plasma and saliva alpha-synuclein neither
correlate with CSF alpha-synuclein, nor distinguish PD
from controls. CSF beta-amyloid1-42 remains a potential
biomarker for cognitive impairment in PD. V

Biomarkers have the potential to play a role in estab-
lishing PD diagnosis, understanding disease progression
or disease-related features, and monitoring therapeutic
effects. In PD, candidate biofluids include cerebrospinal
fluid (CSF), plasma/serum, saliva, and urine, among
others.1-3 Alpha-synuclein (a-syn) holds promise as a bio-
marker because it is a major component of Lewy bodies,
can be found in peripheral tissues and body fluids, is read-
ily secreted into extracellular spaces, and in part can be
detected in exosomes.4 Studies consistently demonstrate
reduced CSF total a-syn levels in PD when compared
with healthy controls (HC).1,5,6 Because of the invasive
nature of acquiring CSF, more readily accessible bio-
fluids, such as blood or saliva, are attractive alternatives.
Red blood cells express high levels of a-syn, but reports of
plasma/serum a-syn in PD when compared with HC have
yielded conflicting results.4,7,8 Saliva is an interesting
source of a-syn because Lewy pathology has been noted
in salivary glands,9 but studies of salivary a-syn have pro-
duced contradictory results, with levels either increased
or not different between PD and HC.8,10 There are no
studies of which we are aware that investigate the rela-
tionships among CSF, plasma, and salivary a-syn in PD.
Several studies have examined CSF markers of neu-
rodegeneration in PD (eg, a-syn, beta-amyloid [Ab] 1-
40 and 1-42, total tau [t-tau], and phosphorylated tau
[p-tau] concentrations), but most studies focus on
either de novo PD patients (eg, deprenyl and tocoph-
erol antioxidative therapy of parkinsonism [DATA-
TOP] or Parkinson’s Progression Markers Initiative
[PPMI]), or specifically on cognitive measures in PD
cohorts.1,11-16 Of this work, the prevailing evidence is
that CSF a-syn is reduced in PD and that subspecies
of a-syn oligomers may distinguish PD from controls.
Furthermore, Ab and tau may provide useful insight
into prognosticating cognitive decline in PD. To date,
few studies have examined CSF a-syn, Ab, t-tau, and
p-tau obtained simultaneously in moderate-advanced
“typical” PD cohorts or investigated how they relate
to specific motor and nonmotor features of PD, such
as motor subtype, sleep, and other nonmotor features.
BioFIND, a cross-sectional, observational study of
moderate-advanced PD patients and matched HCs evalu-
ated with standardized clinical and biospecimen acquisi-
tion protocols, provides a unique resource for examining
biomarkers in a well-characterized, “typical” (including
good response to levodopa) PD population.17 The aim of
our study was 3-fold: (1) examine relationships among
(a) CSF markers of neurodegeneration (ie, a-syn, Ab1-42,
t-tau, p-tau) in PD and HC in the BioFIND cohort and
(b) in PD participants, the relationships among CSF,
plasma, and saliva a-syn levels; (2) determine differences
between PD and HC in CSF a-syn, Ab1-42, tau, and p-
tau and in plasma and saliva levels of a-syn; and (3)
investigate the associations of CSF markers with specific
motor and nonmotor features of PD.
Methods
BioFIND Study and Design
BioFIND includes moderate-advanced PD participants
and HCs enrolled at 8 sites in the United States.17 PD
patients had “typical” features, meeting United Kingdom
PD Society Brain Bank clinical diagnostic criteria and hav-
ing all 3 classic parkinsonian motor signs (ie, bradykine-
sia, rigidity, resting tremor) by history or examination;
represented all Hoehn and Yahr stages; had disease dura-
tions � 4 years and onset between ages 50 to 75 years;
and demonstrated well-established responses to dopami-
nergic agents and/or amantadine. Patients were excluded
if they had features of atypical or secondary parkinsonian
syndromes; a history of DBS or ablative brain surgery; a
history of cancer (except basal or squamous cell skin can-
cers) within 5 years preceding enrollment; autoimmune,
liver, or hematological disorders; or conditions precluding
lumbar puncture. HCs were group matched by age and
sex to PD patients, were free of any known neurological
disorders, and scored � 26 on the Montreal Cognitive
Assessment (MoCA).18 Other exclusion criteria for HCs
were similar to those for PD patients. Controls were
excluded if they had a first-degree family member with

 PD. Additional details regarding the study are discussed
in the BioFIND paper.17
Evaluations
Clinical data and biospecimen collection occurred on
2 visits (baseline, [V1] and follow-up within 2 weeks of
baseline, [V2]). For PD patients, V1 was performed in
the on state (1-3 hours after the last PD medication
dose) and V2 was performed in the practically defined
off state (early morning before PD medications and
approximately 12 hours after the last dose the night
before). V1 included collection of blood for DNA and
plasma and assessments including the International Par-
kinson and Movement Disorder Society–Sponsored revi-
sion of the UPDRS (MDS-UPDRS) parts I (nonmotor
experiences of daily living), II (motor experiences of
daily living), III (motor examination), and IV (motor
complications) for PD patients and part III only for
HCs.19 V2 included collection of blood for RNA and
plasma, CSF, saliva (added after study startup), and
MDS-UPDRS part III in PD patients. All PD and HCs
either fasted or had a low-fat diet on the morning of V2.
Assessments included demographics, family history of
PD, medical/neurological histories, medications, neuro-
logical exams, and the MDS-UPDRS,19 MoCA,18 and
Rapid Eye Movement Behavior Sleep Disorder (RBD)
Questionnaire20 and for PD patients, the Modified
Schwab and England Activities of Daily Living Scale.21
Motor and Nonmotor Features
For PD patients, motor phenotype was classified as
tremor dominant (TD), postural instability/gait difficulty
(PIGD), and indeterminate,22,23 calculated from MDS-
UPDRS part III motor scores (V2, off) plus pertinent his-
tory questions from MDS-UPDRS part II (2.10 tremor,
2.12 walking and balance, 2.13 freezing; V1 and acquired
only once during the study).23 Other motor and nonmotor
features were examined using the published factor struc-
ture of the MDS-UDPRS for parts I to IV.19 Cognitive
function was measured by MoCA total and subdomain
scores (eg, visuospatial/executive, naming, attention, lan-
guage, abstraction, delayed recall, orientation). RBD was
examined using the RBD questionnaire total score, with a
cut-off of > 5 as indicative of RBD symptoms.
The study was approved by the institutional review
boards for the University of Rochester Clinical Trials
Coordination Center and study sites. Written, informed
consent was obtained from the study participants.
Biospecimen Analyses
Concentrations of a-syn in plasma, CSF, and saliva
samples were analyzed using ELISA assays (BioLegend,
cat. 844101). The concentration of a-syn in each sample
was determined by interpolation of values against the
standard curve established by the reference standards
(range 1500 pg/ml-6.1 pg/ml) using a 4-parameter regres-
sion. Recombinant a-syn from rPeptide was used as the
standard in this assay. Each sample was analyzed in dupli-
cate at appropriate dilutions (1/20 for CSF, 1/200 for
plasma, 1/4 for saliva). Concentrations of hemoglobin in
CSF, plasma, and saliva samples were analyzed using
ELISA assays (Bethyl Laboratories, cat. E80-134). Refer-
ence standards used in the assay ranged from 7.5ng/ml to
125 ng/ml. The concentration of hemoglobin in each
sample was determined by interpolation of values against
the standard curve established by the reference standards
using a 4-parameter regression. The assay has been vali-
dated in multiple matrices including in CSF, plasma, and
saliva (BioLegend manual November 11, 2016). Interas-
say precision and spike/recovery data for saliva are
depicted (Supplementary Figure).

 Simultaneous analysis of Ab1-42, t-tau, and p-tau in
CSF was performed using a highly standardized micro-
bead based research-use-only immunoassay (INNO-
BIA Alz Bio3 kits; Fujirebio, Ghent, Blegium).11 CSF
samples without dilution were measured in 6 analytical
runs in 96-well format, with each set of analyte calibra-
tion standards and quality control samples. A bio-
marker result was defined as the average of the
duplicate concentration values. If a biomarker result
did not meet specified criteria for acceptance, the result
was not included in the final dataset. Two Ab1-42 and
6 t-tau results had microbead counts <50 and 1 p-
tau181 result had duplicate precision (%CV) > 25%;
therefore, these 9 results were invalidated.
Statistical Analysis
The analyses were conducted in IBM SPSS Statistics ver-
sion 23 (IBM Corp., Armonk, New York). Demographic
data, disease characteristics, and biomarker concentra-
tions were compared between PD and HC groups using t
tests. Gender and dichotomous variables (eg, RBD scores)
were compared between groups using chi-square tests.
Between-subjects tests were used to examine MoCA total
and subdomain scores controlling for age and gender and
CSF biomarker levels in motor phenotypes controlling for
age, gender, and duration of disease. Pearson and Spear-
man rho correlations were used to examine the relation-
ships among biofluids, CSF biomarkers, and for CSF with
motor and nonmotor variables, as appropriate and con-
trolling for age, gender, and education. Regression models
controlling for age, gender, and education were used to
examine CSF biomarker predictors of PD diagnosis.
Results
Participant Characteristics
Clinical characteristics of BioFIND participants who
provided at least one of the biomarker specimens are
presented in Table 1. Gender and education years did not
differ significantly between PD and HC groups. PD
patients were older than HCs (P < .01), with mean age of
disease onset 59.9 years, disease duration 8.34 years,
MDS-UPDRS part III total motor score (off) 39.13, and a
median Hoehn and Yahr stage of 2. PD motor pheno-
types included 51.3% TD, 36.5% PIGD, and 12.2%
indeterminate. MoCA total scores were significantly
lower
in
PD
patients
when
compared
with
HCs
(P < .001) as expected because HCs with MoCA scores �
26 were excluded. Of the PD participants, 45.2% had
RBD scores > 5, compared to 6.8% of HCs (P < .001).
Comparisons of CSF, Plasma, and Saliva
Biomarkers in the BioFIND Cohort
In the complete BioFIND cohort (PD and HC), CSF a-
syn concentrations were most strongly correlated with t-
tau (r5 0.81) and modestly with p-tau (r 5 0.43) and
Ab1-42 (r 5 0.41; Ps< .001; Fig. 1). Age was weakly, but
significantly, correlated with CSF measures including
hemoglobin
(r 5 0.18,
P 5 .017),
a-syn
(r 5 0.15,
P 5 .043), and t-tau (r 5 0.20, P < .01). Among PD par-
ticipants only, correlations between CSF a-syn concentra-
tions and Ab1-42, t-tau, and p-tau remained consistent
with those found in the complete BioFIND cohort.
Hemoglobin and a-syn levels were modestly corre-
lated in saliva (r 5 0.41, P 5 .04), but not in plasma
(r 5 20.28, P 5 .16) or CSF (r 5 20.12, P 5 .57) in
the BioFIND cohort. Saliva samples with hemoglobin
concentrations > 1200 ng/ml were excluded to avoid
potential impact of contaminant hemoglobin on a-syn
levels.11,24 We did not exclude participants based on
CSF or plasma hemoglobin levels because there was
no significant correlation between hemoglobin and a-
syn levels in plasma and CSF.
Comparing a-syn across the different biofluids in the
BioFIND cohort, we did not find significant correlations
for a-syn concentrations between CSF and plasma

 (r5 20.08, P 5 .70, n5 177), CSF and saliva (r5 20.13,
P5 .53, n 5 41), or plasma and saliva (r5 0.15, P 5 .48,
n5 48). Likewise, among PD patients, there were no sig-
nificant correlations between a-syn concentrations in CSF
and plasma (r5 20.15, P5 .14, n5 98), CSF and saliva
(r5 20.41, P 5 .87, n5 20), or plasma and saliva
(r5 20.25, P 5 .26, n 5 22).
Comparisons of Biomarkers Between PD and HC
CSF a-syn (P 5 .01) levels were lower in PD patients
when compared with HCs (Table 2, Fig. 2). The a-syn
levels in plasma (P 5 .64) and saliva (P 5 .23), how-
ever, did not differ between PD and HCs. CSF Ab1-42
(P < .01) and p-tau (P 5 .05) levels were lower in PD
patients when compared with HCs, but t-tau (P 5 .08)
levels did not differ between PD and HCs (Table 2).
In regression models adjusted for age, gender, and
education years, the CSF biomarkers were significant
predictors of PD diagnosis (Table 3).
Relationship of CSF Biomarkers With Motor
and Nonmotor Features in PD
None of the CSF biomarkers correlated with, or pre-
dicted, MDS-UPDRS total motor scores. However, CSF
a-syn
levels
differed
among
motor
phenotypes
(P 5 .01), with lower concentrations in participants
with PIGD phenotypes (1215.40 [491.56] pg/ml) than
indeterminate (1682.99 [806.14] pg/ml) and TD pheno-
types (1594.85 [702.45] pg/ml). Post hoc comparisons
revealed differences between PIGD and TD (P < .01;
Fig.
2)
and
PIGD
and
indeterminate
phenotypes
(P 5 .03). The significant difference between motor sub-
types was noted when covariates of age, gender, and
disease duration were considered. CSF Ab1-42, t-tau,
and p-tau did not differ significantly among the PD
motor phenotypes. None of the CSF biomarkers corre-
lated with factors of the MDS-UPDRS parts I to IV.
The only CSF biomarker associated with cognition was
Ab1-42, which correlated weakly with MoCA remote
recall (Spearman rho 5 0.23, P 5 .02) and attention sub-
scores (Spearman rho 5 20.19, P 5 .05). There were no
significant correlations between any of the CSF bio-
markers and dichotomized RBD scores in the PD patients.
Discussion
This cross-sectional, observational study examined
the levels of a-syn across multiple biofluid matrices (ie,
CSF, saliva, and plasma) and multiple CSF neurodegen-
erative biomarkers (ie, a-syn, Ab1-42, t-tau, and p-tau)
in a large sample of “typical,” moderate-advanced PD

 and matched healthy control participants. CSF a-syn
strongly correlated with t-tau and modestly, but signifi-
cantly, with Ab1-42 and p-tau. a-syn levels in different
biofluids such as CSF, plasma, and saliva did not signifi-
cantly correlate with each other. Overall, CSF a-syn,
Ab1-42, and p-tau concentrations were lower in PD
when compared with healthy control participants,
whereas t-tau levels did not significantly differ between
groups. Furthermore, the concentration of CSF a-syn,
but not the other CSF neurodegenerative markers, was
significantly lower in those PD patients with PIGD
motor phenotypes than in TD and indeterminate pheno-
types. Finally, CSF Ab1-42 levels significantly correlated
with aspects of cognition on the MoCA examination.
Our findings provide insights into the a-syn levels
across multiple biofluid matrices. Peripheral manifesta-
tion of Lewy type pathology has been explored as a
diagnostic marker. One study noted a weak correla-
tion (r 5 0.197) of CSF and total plasma a-syn,4 but
we did not find a significant correlation of a-syn levels
in peripheral biofluids (plasma and saliva) with a-syn
levels in CSF in our cohort, perhaps because of the
differences in biofluid methodologies or sample char-
acteristics. Plasma and saliva a-syn levels did not sig-
nificantly
differentiate
PD
from
healthy
control
participants. Thus, CSF a-syn has greater diagnostic
utility for PD than peripheral a-syn despite its more
invasive nature for obtaining samples.
Consistent with published literature including a study
of 63 de novo PD and 32 healthy control participants in
PPMI, CSF a-syn levels in PD strongly correlated with
t-tau, and to a lesser degree, p-tau.11 In BioFIND, we
also identified a modest correlation of CSF a-syn and
Ab1-42, which supports findings from a larger PPMI
study of 660 participants (r 5 0.35, P < .01).25 These
findings suggest that CSF a-syn, Ab1-42, and tau may
interact on cellular and pathophysiological levels in PD.
Interactions of a-syn and tau proteins have been
described in animal models and postmortem brain stud-
ies, including colocalization of tau-positive tangles and
a-syn-positive Lewy bodies,26,27 and a-syn and Ab1-42
may have a synergistic relationship.28,29 A greater
understanding of the molecular mechanisms of overlap-
ping proteinopathies and their underlying pathology in
PD, along with relevant biomarkers, will contribute to
the development and validation of biomarkers used for
diagnosis, prognosis, and therapeutic monitoring in PD.
In agreement with previous reports, CSF a-syn levels
were lower in PD than in HCs and, in classification and
regression models, distinguished these groups from each
other.5,30-32 In the BioFIND cohort, CSF t-tau levels did
not differ significantly between groups, although p-tau
levels demonstrated borderline significance (P 5 .05).
Ab1-42 also differentiated PD patients when compared
with healthy controls. We recognize, however, that
many studies represent healthy controls as the ceiling of
health, such as our enrollment criteria of controls with
MoCA scores � 26; these groupings may introduce
potential bias by detecting greater differences between
disease and healthy states. However, it is interesting to
note that CSF Ab1-42 may relate to certain cognitive
domains such as remote memory; this finding supports
CSF Ab1-42 as an important potential biomarker for
cognitive impairment in PD.12,15,16,33-35
It is notable that CSF a-syn levels did not correlate with
several disease-related characteristics, including MDS-
UPDRS total motor scores (part III), motor complications
(part IV), and motor experiences of daily living (part II).
Furthermore, CSF a-syn did not correlate with nonmotor
features including RBD, cognition as measured by the
MoCA, or nonmotor experiences of daily living (MDS-
UPDRS part I). The lack of a relationship between RBD
and CSF a-syn in our cohort differs from a study in which
oligomeric a-syn levels were elevated in the CSF and serum
in PD patients with RBD when compared with PD patients
without RBD and controls. The different methodologies
used and the more advanced PD participants included in
our study may contribute to different study findings.36
CSF a-syn levels may be useful for distinguishing the dis-
ease state, but may not be strong biomarkers for disease
progression once already at moderate-advanced stages.
CSF a-syn levels differed among the PD motor pheno-
types, with lower levels in the PIGD subtype. Although
lower CSF a-syn levels may not predict motor scores,
they may be useful in distinguishing motor phenotypes
and for prognosticiation because PIGD deficits may por-
tend a worsened motor and cognitive course of PD. The
relationship of CSF a-syn, but not other CSF markers, to
PIGD motor phenotype in PD also occurs in early PD as
described in the PPMI cohort.25 Although suggestive of a
potential prognostic value, longitudinal studies are
needed for confirmation.11
The strengths of our study include well-characterized
and “typical” PD patients, rigorously collected and
detailed clinical and biospecimen data, and simultaneous
measurement of multiple CSF neurodegenerative markers
and of a-syn across multiple biofluid sources. We probed
relationships of CSF biomarkers with motor and nonmotor
variables, such as RBD and MDS-UPDRS factors, which
have received limited attention to date. We note several
study limitations, including its cross-sectional design and
lack of clinico-pathological correlations, which preclude
our ability to determine relationships between biomarkers
and disease progression or neuropathology. RBD assess-
ment was based on self-report without confirmation by
polysomnography, and cognition was measured with a
screening questionnaire rather than a full cognitive battery.
Despite this, our findings provide direction for design of
more in-depth future studies. Lastly, although our CSF and
plasma sample sizes are large, the number of salivary speci-
mens was small because this assessment was added after
the study had begun, and thus larger studies are needed.

 The BioFIND cohort offers a unique opportunity to
compare
a-syn
across
different
biofluids.
In
our
cohort, a-syn levels in different biofluids such as CSF,
plasma, and saliva did not significantly correlate with
each other. In addition, the finding that CSF a-syn lev-
els are associated with PIGD motor phenotype sug-
gests that this marker may also be useful for providing
prognostic information for PD patients.
