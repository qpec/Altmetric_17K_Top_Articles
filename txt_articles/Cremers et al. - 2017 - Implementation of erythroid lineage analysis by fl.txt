low cytometric analysis is a recommended tool in the diagnosis of
myelodysplastic syndromes. Current flow cytometric approaches
evaluate the (im)mature myelo-/monocytic lineage with a median
sensitivity and specificity of ~71% and ~93%, respectively. We hypoth-
esized that the addition of erythroid lineage analysis could increase the
sensitivity of flow cytometry. Hereto, we validated the analysis of ery-
throid lineage parameters recommended by the International/European
LeukemiaNet Working Group for Flow Cytometry in Myelodysplastic
Syndromes, and incorporated this evaluation in currently applied flow
cytometric models. One hundred and sixty-seven bone marrow aspirates
were analyzed; 106 patients with myelodysplastic syndromes, and 61
cytopenic controls. There was a strong correlation between presence of
erythroid aberrancies assessed by flow cytometry and the diagnosis of
myelodysplastic syndromes when validating the previously described
erythroid evaluation. Furthermore, addition of erythroid aberrancies to
two different flow cytometric models led to an increased sensitivity in
detecting myelodysplastic syndromes: from 74% to 86% for the addi-
tion to the diagnostic score designed by Ogata and colleagues, and from
69% to 80% for the addition to the integrated flow cytometric score for
myelodysplastic syndromes, designed by our group. In both models the
specificity was unaffected. The high sensitivity and specificity of flow
cytometry in the detection of myelodysplastic syndromes illustrates the
important value of flow cytometry in a standardized diagnostic
approach. The trial is registered at www.trialregister.nl as NTR1825;

ABSTRACT
Introduction
Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are a heterogeneous group of clonal
hematopoietic disorders characterized by cytopenia(s) and risk of leukemic transfor-
mation.1 Multi-parameter flow cytometric (FC) analysis is a recommended tool to
 support the diagnosis of MDS, which is based on dysplas-
tic features by cytomorphology and typical cytogenetic
abnormalities.2 The International/European LeukemiaNet
Working Group for Flow Cytometry in MDS (IMDS-flow)
provided recommendations on how to process and ana-
lyze bone marrow aspirates of patients with unexplained
cytopenias suspected of MDS.3,4 Analytic methods have
been developed and validated for characterization and
quantification of dysplasia and enable accurate diagnosis
of MDS.5–12 The most straightforward is a four-parametric
diagnostic score that integrates percentage of CD34-posi-
tive myeloid progenitors, percentage of B-cell progenitors
within the CD34-positive compartment, CD45 expression
level of CD34-positive myeloid progenitors (related to
CD45 expression level on lymphocytes), and sideward
light scatter peak channel value (SSC) of granulocytic cells
(related to SSC of lymphocytes). This diagnostic score has
a sensitivity and specificity of 69% and 92%, respectively,
in low-intermediate risk MDS.13,14 More elaborate scores
can reach specificities of up to 100%; this, however, is
accompanied by lower sensitivities.15 In accordance with
recommendations issued by the IMDS-flow, our group
designed and validated an integrated MDS-FC score (iFS).16
The iFS comprises the diagnostic score and evaluation of
frequently described aberrant expression levels of lineage
defining markers and presence of lineage infidelity markers
on (im)mature myelo-/monocytic cells. Sensitivity and
specificity of the iFS within a large cohort of patients with
persistent cytopenias of unknown origin were 63% and
98%, respectively.17 The lower sensitivity in this and other
reports can be explained by the fact that most MDS-FC
approaches only evaluate the myeloid cell compartment.
Since dyserythropoiesis is the most prevalent feature by
cytomorphology in MDS, the addition of in-depth evalua-
tion of the erythroid compartment is expected to improve
sensitivity.18 MDS patients with erythroid dysplasia, but
without dysmyelopoiesis, may then be identified by FC. 
For evaluation of the erythroid compartment, different
antibody combinations of CD45, CD235a, CD71, CD36,
CD105, and intracellular markers such as cytosolic H-fer-
ritin, cytosolic L-ferritin and mitochondrial ferritin have
been described.19–22 The IMDS-flow group recently pro-
posed guidelines for erythroid evaluation, advising the
evaluation of CD36 coefficient of variation (CV), CD71
CV and mean fluorescence intensity (MFI), and percentage
of progenitors (CD117 positive within CD45 negative-
diminished cell fraction) within the erythroid compart-
ment. Sensitivity and specificity of this marker combina-
tion for the detection of MDS-associated erythroid aber-
rancies were 35% and 90%, respectively. The current
study aimed to validate these erythroid parameters in an
independent cohort of patients diagnosed with MDS
treated within a prospective clinical study and in a refer-
ence group of patients with proven non-clonal cytopenias.
Furthermore, the additive value of erythroid evaluation to
currently applied MDS-FC diagnostic approaches was
explored.
Methods 
Patients 
A well-defined MDS group and cytopenic control group were
assembled between May 2009 and July 2014 (Table 1). The
MDS group consisted of patients enrolled in the HOVON89
study. Bone marrow aspirates for FC analysis were taken prior
to inclusion, and MDS was diagnosed in accordance with the
minimum diagnostic criteria established by the WHO 2001 cri-
teria.23 The definition of non-clonal cytopenias was based on
clinical characteristics, cytomorphology, cytogenetic and bio-
chemical indicators. The median age of the MDS group was 71
(range 38-85). The median age of the control group was 65
(range 23-91). The research program was approved by the local
ethics committee, and all patient-related research strictly abided
by the Declaration of Helsinki. 
Sample preparation, antibody combinations, and cell
acquisition  
Sample processing was performed according to ELN guidelines
for FC within 24 hours.15 A 4-color analysis was performed from
2009-2012, and an 8-color analysis from 2012-2014. The staining
panels are outlined in the Online Supplementary Table S1. At least
100,000 CD45-positive events were acquired using a
FACSCaliburTM or FACSCantoIITM (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA,
USA). Cells were analyzed using Cell QuestPro (BD Biosciences)
or Infinicyt software (Cytognos, Salamanca, Spain), respectively.
Gating was performed as previously described.15,24 
MDS-FC scores
For evaluation of the erythroid compartment, guidelines as
described by the IMDS-flow were applied. Erythroid evaluation
included analysis of CD71 (CV and MFI), CD36 (CV), and CD117
(percentage within the CD45-negative-diminished cell fraction).
Cut-off values were assessed as described in the tandem-paper
(see also the mathematical examples in the Online Supplementary
Files of the paper). Examples are provided in Online Supplementary
Figure S1. Following the simplified recommendations, an increased
CV of CD71, a decreased MFI of CD71, an increased CV of CD36,
and a decreased or increased percentage of CD117 were each
assigned one point. A score of ≥2 points was defined as MDS-
associated erythroid aberrancies. The four-parameter diagnostic
score was calculated according to guidelines as previously
described, using the defined cut-offs.13 The iFS was established as
described previously.25 The diagnostic score, the iFS, and the ery-
throid score are described in Table 2A.
Models for incorporation of erythroid analysis 
Tables 2B-2C describe the two models designed to add ery-
throid FC analysis to validated MDS-FC approaches. Patients with
MDS-associated erythroid aberrancies received one extra point in
comparison with the original diagnostic score; a total of ≥2 points
was labeled as MDS. The second model added erythroid evalua-
tion to the iFS. Patients with iFS results B with erythroid aberran-
cies by FC were labeled compatible with MDS. 
Statistics
Results from MDS-FC were compared between the MDS and
control group. Absolute numbers and relative percentages
described the data. To test the concordance between presence of
MDS-associated erythroid aberrancies and patient group, a chi-
square test was performed. To compare the results of different
techniques the McNemar test was used. P-values <0.05 were sta-
tistically significant. Specificity and sensitivity, and 95%-confi-
dence intervals, were calculated for each MDS-FC model using a
two-by-two model. Inter-observer analysis of MDS-FC aberran-
cies and the diagnostic score was tested by an independent MDS-
expert center: the Department of Immunology of the Erasmus
University Medical Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.
Analyses were performed using PASW Statistics version 20.0
(SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA).

 Results
Evaluation of erythroid markers
In accordance with the IMDS-flow recommendations,
we analyzed CD36 (CV), CD71 (CV and MFI), and CD117
(percentage within the CD45 negative-diminished cell
fraction). Table 1 lists the analyzed erythroid markers per
group. An increased CV of CD71 was the most sensitive
marker for MDS as it was positive in 66% of MDS
patients, followed by an increased/decreased percentage
of CD117 (64%). An increased CV of CD36 was the most
specific marker as only 3% of controls were positive for
this marker. Within the MDS group, 64% patients showed
multiple erythroid aberrancies (≥2 points), compared with
11% of patients within the control group. The presence of
multiple erythroid aberrancies was significantly correlated
with the diagnosis of MDS (P<0.001). 
Correlation between patient group and cytomorphology
Since we found a significant correlation between patient
group (MDS or control) and the presence of erythroid
aberrancies, the next step was to evaluate the relation

ter (70/106 MDS patients; 66%). In summary: 11% of the controls and 64% of the MDS patients show MDS-associated erythroid aberrancies, as defined by ≥2 points.

in more detail. As controls might have minimal dysery-
thropoiesis by cytomorphology, FC might also detect ery-
throid aberrancies in controls.26,27 Information about ery-
throid features by cytomorphology was available in 92%
of patients in the MDS group, and in 98% patients within
the control group. Table 3 provides an overview of the
results. Although the positive test results (dyserythro-
poiesis by cytomorphology and erythroid aberrancies by
FC) seem equally distributed between the MDS and the
controls,  FC identified more dysplastic cases than cyto-
morphology (MDS-FC-positive cases within the cytopenic
controls based on morphology). Therefore, the McNemar
test, which focuses on the differences between two corre-
lated proportions, was not significant (P=0.01).  
Addition of erythroid markers to current MDS-FC 
scoring systems - diagnostic score
The original diagnostic score was indicative for MDS in
78/106 MDS patients, and negative for MDS in 53/61 of
the control patients (Figure 1). Hence, sensitivity and
specificity of this diagnostic score were 74% (95% CI:

 64%-82%) and 87% (95% CI: 76%-94%), respectively.
By erythroid evaluation, 64% of MDS patients and 11%
of controls revealed erythroid aberrancies by FC (Table 1).
Erythroid results were added to the diagnostic score as
illustrated in Table 2B. This led to an upgrade in MDS-FC
category in 13 MDS patients and 2 controls.
Consequently, the sensitivity and specificity for the diag-
nostic score including erythroid evaluation were 86%
(95% CI: 78%-92%) and 84% (95% CI: 72%-92%),
respectively.
Addition of erythroid markers to current MDS-FC 
scoring systems - integrated MDS-FC score
With the addition of erythroid analysis, two extra RARS
patients, five RCMD patients, four RCMD-RS patients,
and one del(5q) patient were subsequently recognized as
MDS. The addition of erythroid analysis did not alter the
results for the RAEB-1, MDS-U and CMML patients
(Figure 2 and Table S2). Results of the original iFS were C
‘compatible with MDS’ in 73/106, B ‘minor MDS related
aberrancies’ in 21/106, and A ‘not compatible with MDS’
in 12/106 MDS patients. Interestingly, each MDS patient
not recognized by the original iFS showed only dysery-
thropoiesis with or without dysmegakaryopoiesis by
cytomorphological assessment. In the control group,
results were A in 40/61 patients, B in 20/61 patients, and
C in only 1/61 patients. The calculated sensitivity and
specificity of the iFS were 69% (95% CI: 59% to 78%)
and 98% (95% CI: 91%-100%), respectively. 
In the MDS group, 33 patients were not assigned to
MDS by the original iFS (Figure 1; category A and B). After
addition of erythroid evaluation, 12 MDS patients
changed from B to C (now allocated MDS), and 5 patients
in category A were changed to B (limited changes but still
no MDS). In total, 21 patients were not assigned to MDS;
7 in category A, 14 in category B.  In the control group, one
patient was incorrectly identified as MDS (category C).
After addition of erythroid evaluation, two extra patients
in category B were upgraded to C and thus allocated as
MDS (Figure 1). Overall, the sensitivity of the iFS
increased to 80% (95% CI: 71%-87%), and the specificity
showed only a minor decline to 95% (95% CI: 86%-99%)
In summary, the sensitivity for both the diagnostic score
and the iFS increased significantly after addition of ery-
throid evaluation. For the diagnostic score, sensitivity
increased from 74% to 86%, and the iFS sensitivity
increased from 69% to 80%. For both strategies, specifici-
ty was only marginally affected: 87% to 84% for the diag-
nostic score; and 98% to 95% for the iFS. Figure 2 illus-
trates distribution of WHO classifications within the orig-
inal iFS, and after addition of erythroid evaluation. 
Robustness of the MDS-FC results 
Interpretation of FC data in MDS is considered to require
a high level of expertise. To check solidity of our MDS-FC
based conclusions, 25% of the MDS cases were analyzed
blindly by an independent MDS-FC expert center (VHJvdV
and JtM). The scores were calculated in the same data files.
Results of the diagnostic score revealed a concordance of
100% and 89% for the 4-color and 8-color analysis, respec-
tively. Analysis of the iFS revealed a concordance of 89%
and 86%, for the 4-color analysis and the 8-color analysis,
respectively. Addition of erythroid evaluation did not influ-
ence the concordance of the MDS-FC models.

 Discussion
The evaluation of dyserythropoiesis by a flow cytomet-
ric (FC) approach is not included in most of today’s MDS-
FC models. The International/European LeukemiaNet
Working Group for Flow Cytometry in MDS (IMDS-flow)
proposed a method for evaluation of the erythroid com-
partment by FC. In the current study, we validated ery-
throid evaluation and investigated the value of the intro-
duced erythroid evaluation in two previously validated
MDS-FC approaches. We analyzed 167 bone marrow
aspirates, 106 patients with MDS, and 61 cytopenic con-
trols for which the IMDS-Flow erythroid score, diagnostic
score, and integrated FC score (iFS) were calculated.13,16
Originally, the erythroid score was designed as a weighted
score. It can also be applied as a numerical score (one point
per parameter) in which ≥2 points identifies MDS-associ-
ated erythroid aberrancies. The exception made in the
tandem-manuscript is to be noted: if the 2 points are based
on the combination of decreased MFI of CD71 and abnor-
mal percentage of CD117, an additional aberrancy is war-
ranted. The latter was not seen in this cohort. Results from
erythroid evaluation confirmed the results of the IMDS-
flow report since we showed a strong significant correla-
tion between MDS-associated erythroid aberrancies
assessed by FC and MDS. Investigation of the correlations
between cytomorphological results and FC results sug-
gested that FC detected less erythroid aberrancies com-
pared with cytomorphology results. Here, the fact that
both techniques investigate different aspects needs to be
considered. FC mainly evaluates cell surface characteris-
tics, whilst cytomorphology also evaluates features within
the cell, such as nuclear bridging. It is unknown whether
these dysplastic features result in altered antigen expres-
sion. The FC method is however rather specific as, for
example, it did not report MDS-associated erythroid aber-
rancies where cytomorphology described dyserythro-
poiesis in patients with a vitamin B12 deficiency. This
indicates that both techniques provide supplementary
information and complement, rather than contradict, one
another.
The goal of the study was to increase the sensitivity of
currently applied MDS-FC models. Indeed, the addition of
erythroid lineage analysis to the currently applied diag-
nostic score demonstrated an increased sensitivity (from
74% to 86%), without a major loss in specificity (87% to
84%). These results support the findings of Mathis et al.,
who tested the addition of erythroid evaluation by FC in
non-lysed samples (RED score) to the diagnostic score.22
The combination was analyzed in a cohort of 101 patients
(83 MDS patients and only 18 controls) and resulted in a
sensitivity and specificity of 88% and 89%, respectively.
The RED score and the erythroid score described by the
IMDS-flow both comprised evaluation of CD36 CV and
CD71 CV. Differences were, however, i) a non-lysed
method in the RED score, ii) the addition of hemoglobin
level in the RED score, iii) the added value of percentage
of CD117, and iii) added value of expression level of
CD71. As illustrated by Mathis and colleagues, hemoglo-
bin showed a strong negative correlation with the other
markers in the RED score. Note, hemoglobin might be
subject to confounders, e.g., transfusion requirements, and
as a non-FC parameter less suitable in a MDS-FC model. 
The second diagnostic MDS-FC model evaluated in the
current study was the iFS; a more extensive model, com-
prising the diagnostic score and evaluation of frequently
described aberrancies on (im)mature myelo-/monocytic
cells. Addition of erythroid markers to this score led to an
increased sensitivity (from 69 to 80%), without substan-
tially affecting the specificity (from 98 to 95%). The com-
bination of the iFS with the IMDS-flow erythroid score
showed the highest specificity; higher than the other
described scores. 
Most described MDS-FC scores were designed and val-
idated in large patient cohorts. However, interpretation of
results within individual patients can be challenging. To
our knowledge, the iFS is the only MDS-FC algorithm that
has proven its power in individual patients, demonstrated
by its high specificity in patients with cytopenias of
unknown origin followed over time.17 After addition of
erythroid lineage evaluation, its specificity remained high
and, therefore, it might be expected that the new model is
applicable in individual patient analysis. 
To not overcall patients with cytopenia of unknown ori-
gin as MDS, one would prefer to apply the most specific
model. However, in an era where cost-effectiveness is
becoming increasingly important, a limited panel might be
preferred. To improve the four-parameter diagnostic
score, Bardet and colleagues advised the addition of CD7
(on myeloid progenitors) and CD56 (on monocytes) to the
diagnostic score.28 Specificity of this adjusted score was
87%; however, the sensitivity was low (66%). Here, the
addition of selected erythroid markers might improve the
sensitivity of FC. 
The addition of analysis of mutation in genes involving
splicing factors, epigenetic regulators, signal transduction
or the cohesion complex, to diagnostic evaluation is sug-
gested.29,30 However, none of the mutations is disease spe-

 cific, and some mutations appeared to be present in low
frequency in the elderly population.31 Therefore, more
research regarding their role in the diagnostic setting in
MDS is warranted. Until then, FC has proven to be a valu-
able diagnostic tool, which can fill in the gaps where cyto-
morphology and cytogenetic results are less certain of a
diagnosis. It has shown to be highly specific in the diagno-
sis of MDS, so can exclude patients from unnecessary fol-
low-up. MDS-FC is described to be less sensitive in MDS
recognition. Our study, however, showed that addition of
erythroid evaluation to currently applied MDS-FC models
increased the sensitivity of FC in the detection of MDS.
We postulate, therefore, that MDS-FC is ready for general
clinical application.
