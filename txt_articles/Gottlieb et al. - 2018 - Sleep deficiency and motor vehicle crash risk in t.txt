risk in the general population: a
prospective cohort study

Abstract
Background: Insufficient sleep duration and obstructive sleep apnea, two common causes of sleep deficiency in
adults, can result in excessive sleepiness, a well-recognized cause of motor vehicle crashes, although their contribution
to crash risk in the general population remains uncertain. The objective of this study was to evaluate the relation of
sleep apnea, sleep duration, and excessive sleepiness to crash risk in a community-dwelling population.
Methods: This was a prospective observational cohort study nested within the Sleep Heart Health Study, a community-
based study of the health consequences of sleep apnea. The participants were 1745 men and 1456 women aged 40–89
years. Sleep apnea was measured by home polysomnography and questionnaires were used to assess usual sleep
duration and daytime sleepiness. A follow-up questionnaire 2 years after baseline ascertained driving habits and motor
vehicle crash history. Logistic regression analysis was used to examine the relation of sleep apnea and sleep duration at
baseline to the occurrence of motor vehicle crashes during the year preceding the follow-up visit, adjusting for relevant
covariates. The population-attributable fraction of motor vehicle crashes was estimated from the sample proportion of
motor vehicle crashes and the adjusted odds ratios for motor vehicle crash within each exposure category.
Results: Among 3201 evaluable participants, 222 (6.9%) reported at least one motor vehicle crash during the prior year. A
higher apnea-hypopnea index (p < 0.01), fewer hours of sleep (p = 0.04), and self-reported excessive sleepiness (p < 0.01)
were each significantly associated with crash risk. Severe sleep apnea was associated with a 123% increased crash risk,
compared to no sleep apnea. Sleeping 6 hours per night was associated with a 33% increased crash risk, compared to
sleeping 7 or 8 hours per night. These associations were present even in those who did not report excessive sleepiness.
The population-attributable fraction of motor vehicle crashes was 10% due to sleep apnea and 9% due to sleep duration
less than 7 hours.
Conclusions: Sleep deficiency due to either sleep apnea or insufficient sleep duration is strongly associated with motor
vehicle crashes in the general population, independent of self-reported excessive sleepiness.

 Background
Sleep deficiency, defined as insufficient “quantity or
quality of sleep” for optimal health and performance,
may result from inadequate total sleep duration or from
fragmentation of sleep [1]. The potential health impact
of insufficient sleep duration was first reported in the
1960s, when a general population survey of over one
million adults found that individuals who reported sleep-
ing fewer than 7 hours per night had increased mortality
compared to those sleeping 7 to 8 hours per night [2, 3].
Recent data indicate that usual sleep duration has
decreased substantially since that time, with an esti-
mated 25–30% of U.S. adults now sleeping 6 or fewer
hours per night, a sleep duration associated with obesity,
hypertension, glucose intolerance, diabetes mellitus, cor-
onary heart disease, and death [4]. Restricted sleep is
also an important cause of excessive sleepiness, a well-
recognized cause of motor vehicle crashes [5–7]. Data
from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control indicate that
habitual sleep duration of 6 or fewer hours per night is
associated with a 2.6-fold higher risk of reporting having
fallen asleep while driving, compared to those sleeping
7–9 hours per night, although motor vehicle crashes
were not assessed [8]. Although there are individual
differences in impairment from sleep deprivation [9], the
perception of impairment quickly plateaus in individuals
whose sleep duration is chronically restricted, despite
continued declines in objective measures of performance
[10, 11], suggesting that individuals may be unaware of
their degree of impairment from sleep deficiency.
Obstructive sleep apnea is a common chronic disorder
in adults and it is associated with excessive sleepiness
[12]. The prevalence of sleep apnea has increased with
the increase in overweight and obesity. Estimates based
on current U.S. population demographics indicate that
17% of women and 34% of men aged 30–70 have sleep
apnea [13], with 5% and 14%, respectively, having both
sleep apnea and self-reported excessive sleepiness. Like
insufficient sleep duration, sleep apnea is associated with
hypertension, diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease,
and mortality [4, 14–17]. Sleep apnea is also associated
with motor vehicle crash risk [18]. A recent meta-
analysis concluded that patients with obstructive sleep
apnea have a crash risk approximately 2.5 times that of
individuals without sleep apnea, but the data were
equivocal whether the excess crash risk was explained
solely on the basis of excessive sleepiness [19]. While a
diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea can be made in the
absence of excessive sleepiness [20], the importance of
asymptomatic sleep apnea has been questioned. A recent
U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendation
concluded that “the current evidence is insufficient to
assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for
obstructive sleep apnea in asymptomatic adults” [21].
As self-perceived excessive sleepiness is absent in more
than half of individuals with sleep apnea in the general
population, even among those with severe sleep apnea
[13, 22], it remains an important unresolved question
whether these individuals are at increased motor vehicle
crash risk. Similarly, it has been argued that some indi-
viduals are naturally short sleepers and that failure to
obtain an optimal duration of sleep is inconsequential in
the absence of subjective sleepiness. In the present ana-
lysis, we ask whether individuals with sleep deficiency,
due either to short usual sleep duration or obstructive
sleep apnea, are at increased risk of motor vehicle
crashes, independent of self-reported daytime sleepiness.
Methods
Study design
The Sleep Heart Health Study is a community-based pro-
spective cohort study of the cardiovascular consequences
of sleep apnea. Briefly, 6441 men and women aged 40
years and older were recruited from existing population-
based studies, as previously described [23, 24]. Therapy
for sleep apnea or use of nocturnal supplemental oxygen
were exclusion criteria. At baseline, participants com-
pleted sleep habits and general health questionnaires and
underwent overnight polysomnography. Approximately 2
years later, the participants again completed sleep habits
and general health questionnaires, including questions
related to driving habits and history of motor vehicle
crashes. The aim of the present investigation is to deter-
mine whether sleep apnea or short sleep duration are
associated with increased crash risk in the general popula-
tion, and whether self-reported sleepiness identifies those
at increased crash risk. The protocol was approved by the
Institutional Review Board of each participating center
and signed informed consent was provided by each
participant. The full Sleep Heart Health Study protocol,
including the sleep habits, sleepiness and driving history
questionnaires, are available at http://jhuccs1.us/shhs/de-
tails/studydoc.htm.
Study sample
The composition of the study sample is shown in Fig. 1.
Of the 6441 Sleep Heart Health Study participants,
2-year follow-up questionnaire data were available for
5494 (85.3%). Of these, 624 non-drivers were excluded,
as were 238 with missing data on sleepiness, sleep
duration, or motor vehicle accidents. Of the remaining
4632 individuals, 3201 reported the average number of
miles driven per year. Given the strong association
between miles driven and motor vehicle crash risk, these
3201 individuals are the primary sample analyzed for
this report. The included sample was slightly younger
(62.3 vs. 63.5 years, p < 0.001) and had a higher percent-
age of men (54.5% vs. 39.9%, p < 0.001) than the 3240

 participants who were excluded for any reason. Their
reported usual sleep duration was slightly longer (7.1 vs.
7.0 hours/night, p < 0.01), and they were similar to
excluded participants in mean apnea-hypopnea index
(AHI, 8.7 vs. 9.0, p = 0.36) and Epworth Sleepiness Scale
scores (7.9 vs 7.7, p = 0.34). Of the 3201 included partic-
ipants, 2340 reported the usual number of hours driven
per day, while 1295 participants were excluded because
they did not report the number of miles driven per year
but did report the usual number of hours driven per
day. There was no significant difference between included
and excluded participants in reported usual hours of driv-
ing per day (1.83 versus 1.86 hours per day, p = 0.54).
Sleep measures
Participants
underwent
a
single
night
of
in-home
polysomnography at baseline, as previously described
[25, 26]. AHI was defined as the average number of
apneas plus hypopneas per hour of sleep, where both
apneas and hypopneas required an associated 4% or
greater oxygen desaturation. Usual sleep duration was
defined as the response to the question, “How many
hours of sleep do you usually get at night (or your main
sleep period) on weekdays or workdays?” Responses
were integer values. The stability of this measure over
time in this cohort has been previously reported [27].
Sleepiness was assessed using the Epworth Sleepiness
Scale, an eight-item self-completion questionnaire that
asks the participant to rate his/her likelihood of falling
asleep in a variety of commonly encountered situations
[28]. Excessive sleepiness was defined as a score ≥11 on
this scale.
Driving history
As part of a general follow-up questionnaire completed
approximately 2 years after baseline, participants were
asked, “Do you drive?” Those answering affirmatively
were further asked about driving frequency, average time
spent driving per day or miles driven per year, and the
question: “How many accidents have you had in the last
year while you were the driver?”
Statistical analysis
All statistical analyses were performed using SAS version
9.2 (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC). Descriptive statistics
are presented comparing participants with and without
motor vehicle crash, with independent sample t tests
used to compare means of continuous variables and
Fisher’s exact test to compare proportions. Logistic
regression analysis was used to examine the relation of
sleep apnea and sleep duration at baseline to the occur-
rence of at least one motor vehicle crash during the year
preceding the follow-up visit, adjusting for relevant
covariates. The primary models adjusted for age, sex,
and miles driven. The Epworth Sleepiness Scale score
was added to the models to assess mediation by self-

 reported sleepiness of the effects of sleep apnea and
usual sleep duration, and models restricted to those
without excessive sleepiness were run to determine
whether excess crash risk was present in those without
self-reported sleepiness. Models that included both sleep
apnea and sleep duration measures, with an appropriate
interaction term, were used to assess a possible synergy
between sleep apnea and sleep deprivation in relation to
crash risk. Sensitivity analyses including those individ-
uals missing data on miles driven, adjusted only for age
and sex, were conducted to determine whether their
exclusion might have biased the study results. Additional
models
adjusted
for
alcohol
consumption, smoking
history, body mass index, sleeping pill use, and caffeine
consumption; explored the independent effect of habit-
ual snoring on crash risk; explored possible sex differ-
ences in the effect of sleep deficiency on crash risk; and
explored differences in the effect of sleep deficiency be-
tween older and younger participants. The population-
attributable fraction of motor vehicle crashes was esti-
mated from the sample proportion of motor vehicle
crashes in each exposure category and the adjusted odds
ratios for motor vehicle crash in those categories, as
described by Miettinen [29].
Results
At least one motor vehicle crash during the year prior to
follow-up evaluation was reported by 6.9% of the 3201
participants. Motor vehicle crashes were somewhat more
common in men than in women and were significantly
associated with number of miles driven per year, AHI,
sleep duration, and self-reported sleepiness (Table 1).
Adjusted for age, sex, and miles driven, the odds ratio
for any motor vehicle crash increased by 15% for every
10-unit increase in AHI in the overall population and by
17% for every 10-unit increase in AHI in participants
who did not report excessive sleepiness (Table 2). Although
non-linear models were not a significantly better fit to the
data, the excess risk in self-reported non-sleepy partici-
pants was apparent only in those with severe sleep apnea
(Fig. 2a). Compared to those without sleep apnea (AHI < 5,
n = 1730), those with mild (AHI 5 to < 15, n = 913),
moderate (AHI 15 to < 30, n = 364), and severe (AHI ≥30,
n = 194) sleep apnea had adjusted odds ratios (aOR) for
any motor vehicle crash that were respectively 7%, 13%
and 123% higher. The population-attributable fraction of
motor vehicle crashes due to sleep apnea was 10%.
Habitual snoring was not significantly associated with
crash risk in models that included measures of sleep apnea.

 For every hour decrease in usual sleep duration, the
aOR for any motor vehicle crash increased by 13% in
the overall population and by 22% in participants who
did not report excessive sleepiness (Table 2). Crash risk
was similar in those who reported sleeping 7 or 8 hours
per night. Compared to those sleeping 7 or 8 hours per
night (n = 2105), those who reported sleeping only 6
hours per night (n = 626) had a 33% higher aOR for any

hours per night (n = 235) had a 47% higher aOR. Those
who reported sleeping 9 or more hours per night (n = 235)
had the lowest crash risk, with an aOR 24% lower

 motor vehicle crashes related to sleep duration of 6
or fewer hours per night was 9%.
Additional logistic regression models were performed to
explore a possible interaction between sleep apnea and
sleep duration on risk of motor vehicle crash. While it
appears that increased crash risk in those with mild to
moderate sleep apnea is present only in those sleeping 6
or fewer hours per night, and that increased crash risk in
those with severe sleep apnea is present irrespective of
usual sleep duration (Fig. 3), there was no significant inter-
action between sleep duration and sleep apnea severity
with respect to crash risk (interaction term p = 0.65).
The estimated effects of sleep apnea or sleep duration
on crash risk were not significantly different between
men and women, and were not meaningfully affected by
additional adjustment for body mass index, sleeping pill
use, smoking history, usual alcohol consumption, or
consumption of caffeinated beverages. Effects were also
similar between younger and older participants, whether
stratified on age 65 or age 70. Treatment for sleep apnea
with continuous positive airway pressure, surgery, or an
oral appliance at any time since the baseline sleep study
was reported by 2.2% of the study sample, including
4.7% of those with AHI > 5, although treatment adher-
ence and the timing of treatment initiation are not
known. However, excluding from the analysis those who
reported sleep apnea treatment had no meaningful
impact on the association of either sleep apnea or sleep
duration with crash risk. A sensitivity analysis that
included the 1431 participants who completed the driv-
ing questionnaire but were excluded from analysis due
to missing data for miles driven per year, adjusted for
age and sex but not for miles driven, showed little
change in effect estimates or tests of significance.
Self-reported excessive sleepiness was strongly associ-
ated with crash risk (Table 2 and Fig. 2). Despite this,
adjustment for Epworth Sleepiness Scale score had little
impact on the estimated risk associated with sleep apnea
(aOR 1.13 per 10-unit increase in AHI) or usual sleep
duration (aOR 1.12 per hour shorter sleep duration).
Moreover, when the analysis is limited to the 75% of
individuals without self-reported excessive sleepiness,
the association of sleep apnea and usual sleep duration
with motor vehicle crash risk was not diminished (Table 2).
Indeed, the impact of short usual sleep duration on crash
risk is most evident in those individuals who do not
perceive themselves to be excessively sleepy.
Discussion
In this community-dwelling cohort of middle-aged and
older adults, the presence of sleep deficiency, whether
due to short sleep duration or to sleep fragmentation
from sleep apnea, was associated with a significantly
increased risk of motor vehicle crashes, even among
those who did not report excessive sleepiness. While one
must be cautious in drawing a causal inference from
observational data, the 19% estimate of motor vehicle
crashes attributable to sleep deficiency in this analysis is
consistent with estimates from the Virginia Tech 100 car
naturalistic driving study that 22% of actual and near-
crash incidents are attributable to drowsy driving [30],
the Institute of Medicine’s estimate that 20% of serious
motor vehicle crash injuries are attributable to sleep
disorders and sleep deprivation [4], and the recent esti-
mate that 21% of fatal crash injuries are attributable to
drowsy driving [31].
The effect noted in the present study for those with
severe sleep apnea is similar to that reported in clinically
Fig. 3 The joint association of sleep apnea and reported usual sleep duration to motor vehicle crash risk. The referent group is individuals with

 diagnosed sleep apnea patients [18, 19], with consider-
ably smaller effects noted in those with milder sleep
apnea. Individuals with mild to moderate sleep apnea
and self-reported daytime sleepiness more closely resem-
ble clinically diagnosed sleep apnea patients, however,
and in this group the elevation in crash risk was also
similar to that reported in clinically diagnosed patients.
Short sleep duration may also increase crash risk among
individuals with mild to moderate sleep apnea (Fig. 3),
although further study with a larger sample is needed to
verify this suggestive finding. The effects noted in this
study are similar to those reported from the Wisconsin
Sleep Cohort for risk of any motor vehicle crash over 5
years, although smaller than the risk observed in that co-
hort for multiple crashes [32]. There were too few par-
ticipants reporting multiple crashes over the 1-year
reporting interval for this study to replicate the Wiscon-
sin analysis. Sleepiness is a widely recognized cause of
motor vehicle crashes, a finding also confirmed in the
present study. While sleep apnea is an important cause
of excessive sleepiness, many individuals with sleep
apnea in the general community do not report this
symptom [13, 22]. In the present study, severe sleep
apnea was associated with increased crash risk even
among those without self-reported excessive sleepiness.
Together with evidence that excess mortality in sleep
apnea is independent of excessive sleepiness [33], these
data indicate that treatment is warranted for many
apparently asymptomatic patients who deny excessive
sleepiness. These data support the conclusion that it is
inappropriate to insist that the diagnosis and treatment
of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome require excessive
daytime sleepiness, which was standard practice for
many years [34]. Such a requirement minimizes the
prevalence of obstructive sleep apnea and would prevent
the nearly half of patients with severe obstructive sleep
apnea who do not report excessive sleepiness from
obtaining an adequate diagnosis and thorough treat-
ment, thereby perpetuating serious health problems and
increased motor vehicle crash risk. These data support
recent American Academy of Sleep Medicine diagnostic
criteria that do not require the presence of excessive
sleepiness for the diagnosis of severe obstructive sleep
apnea [20].
In response to accumulating evidence of the potential
adverse
cardiovascular,
metabolic,
and
performance
consequences of insufficient sleep, the National Sleep
Foundation, followed by the American Academy of Sleep
Medicine and the Sleep Research Society, recently issued
evidence-based recommendations that adults should
sleep 7 or more hours per night for optimal health [35].
In the present study, habitual sleep durations of less
than 7 hours per night are strongly associated with
increased motor vehicle crash risk, even among those
who do not report excessive sleepiness. A prior case–
control study in a general population sample found that
drivers in crashes involving death or hospitalization were
more likely than control drivers to report having slept 5
or fewer hours the previous night, although the impact
of habitual sleep duration was not assessed [36]. While
reported sleepiness at the time of the crash was strongly
associated with crash risk, usual sleepiness as measured
by the Epworth Sleepiness Scale was not [36]. In a pro-
spective study of new drivers aged 17–24 years, those
who reported habitually sleeping 6 or fewer hours per
night had an increased crash risk compared to those
sleeping more than 6 hours per night, especially for
crashes between the hours of 8 pm and 6 am. That study
did not evaluate the role of sleepiness [37]. Like the
present study, these prior studies suggest increased crash
risk in very short sleepers. However, we further found
that individuals who habitually sleep 9 or more hours
per night have an even lower crash risk than those sleep-
ing the recommended minimum of 7 hours per night,
consistent with evidence that individuals who habitually
sleep 7 to 8 hours per night carry greater sleep debt than
those who habitually sleep 9 hours or more [38]. In
commercial drivers, those with an actigraphy-measured
sleep duration of 7 to 8 hours per night had a greater
sleep propensity and poorer performance on sustained
vigilance tasks compared to drivers whose usual sleep
duration was greater than 8 hours per night [39]. Thus,
the true fraction of motor vehicle crashes attributable to
sleep restriction may well exceed 9%. In the present study,
when those sleeping 9 or more hours per night are consid-
ered the referent group for crash risk, the estimated
population-attributable fraction of crashes due to insuffi-
cient sleep rises to 30%. Together with the population-
attributable fraction of motor vehicle crashes due to sleep
apnea of 10%, this would raise the population-attributable
fraction of motor vehicle crashes due to sleep deficiency
to 40%, which is considerably higher than prior estimates
based largely on self-reporting.
It remains to be determined why many people with
severe sleep apnea or short sleep duration in this study
did not report excessive sleepiness, even though their
elevated crash risk suggests that their driving perform-
ance was impaired. Sleep deficiency might impair driving
performance by decreasing vigilance even in the absence
of increased sleepiness as measured by the Epworth
Sleepiness Scale. Alternatively, usual sleepiness may be
masked by the use of stimulants such as caffeine or by
sympathetic activation secondary to sleep apnea or sleep
deprivation. A reduced perception of sleepiness, particu-
larly among those inured to the daytime consequences
of chronic sleep deficiency, is also likely, and is consist-
ent with the finding that subjective measures of sleepi-
ness

 duration, despite continued declines in objective measures
of performance such as psychomotor vigilance [10, 11].
The Epworth Sleepiness Scale, although a clinical standard
for two decades, may not be a sufficiently sensitive tool to
detect a moderate degree of excessive sleepiness. Partici-
pants may also be reluctant to admit to excessive sleepi-
ness, a symptom that many regard as pejorative, even in a
research setting in which issues of liability are limited. This
is likely to be even more problematic in settings in which
an acknowledgment of sleepiness may have adverse occu-
pational or legal consequences, e.g., with respect to main-
taining a commercial driver’s license [40]. Objective tests
of sleepiness may be more appropriate in this setting [41].
One potential limitation of this study is the use of self-
report measures of driving and crash history. While
motor vehicle crashes documented in police reports are
the gold standard for accident reporting, past studies
have shown that self-reporting is fairly accurate when
reporting on accidents occurring within the prior year,
as was done in this study. In a study of adult drivers
aged 70 and older, there was substantial agreement
between self-report and state-recorded motor vehicle
crashes (kappa = 0.64) [42], with agreement as high as
85% between self- and police-reported crashes among
younger drivers [43]. Moreover, the rate of motor vehicle
crashes reported by the participants in this study (694
per 10,000 person-years or 696 per million miles driven)
is quite similar to the rate of motor vehicle crashes
reported by the AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety for
U.S. adults (650 per 10,000 person-years or 578 per mil-
lion miles driven) [44]. The strong association between
crash risk and miles driven is also internally consistent.
An important strength of this study is the prospective
assessments of sleep apnea, sleep habits, and sleepiness,
which are, therefore, not biased by subsequent crash
history. Although these measures were made 1 year
prior to the start of the reporting interval for driving
history, they are fairly stable over this interval of time
[27, 45] and variation would in any case bias toward a
null result. Another important strength of the study is that
it reflects the experience of a large community-dwelling
cohort, rather than a cohort of clinically referred patients,
and its results are, therefore, more generalizable to the
public at large.
Conclusions
Sleep deficiency resulting from either short sleep duration
or sleep apnea is associated with a substantial increase in
risk of motor vehicle crashes in the general population.
These findings underscore the importance of developing
accessible, valid, and objective biomarkers for determining
impairment due to sleep deficiency. They further highlight
the importance of ensuring that sleep apnea is effectively
identified, diagnosed, and appropriately treated. Finally, in
conjunction with the adverse metabolic consequences of
insufficient sleep, these findings argue for public health
efforts to improve adult sleep health.
