IMPORTANCE Although physician concerns about medical malpractice are substantial,
national data are lacking on the rate of claims paid on behalf of US physicians by specialty.
OBJECTIVE To characterize paid malpractice claims by specialty.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A comprehensive analysis was conducted of all paid
malpractice claims, with linkage to physician specialty, from the National Practitioner Data
Bank from January 1, 1992, to December 31, 2014, a period including an estimated 19.9 million
physician-years. All dollar amounts were inflation adjusted to 2014 dollars using the
Consumer Price Index. The dates on which this analysis was performed were from May 1,
2015, to February 20, 2016, and from October 25 to December 16, 2016.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES For malpractice claims (n = 280 368) paid on behalf of
physicians (in aggregate and by specialty): rates per physician-year, mean compensation
amounts, the concentration of paid claims among a limited number of physicians, the
proportion of paid claims that were greater than $1 million, severity of injury, and type of
malpractice alleged.
RESULTS From 1992-1996 to 2009-2014, the rate of paid claims decreased by 55.7% (from
20.1 to 8.9 per 1000 physician-years; P < .001), ranging from a 13.5% decrease in cardiology
(from 15.6 to 13.5 per 1000 physician-years; P = .15) to a 75.8% decrease in pediatrics (from
9.9 to 2.4 per 1000 physician-years; P < .001). The mean compensation payment was
$329 565. The mean payment increased by 23.3%, from $286 751 in 1992-1996 to $353 473
in 2009-2014 (P < .001). The increases ranged from $17 431 in general practice (from
$218 350 in 1992-1996 to $235 781 in 2009-2014; P = .36) to $114 410 in gastroenterology
(from $276 128 in 1992-1996 to $390 538 in 2009-2014; P < .001) and $138 708 in pathology
(from $335 249 in 1992-1996 to $473 957 in 2009-2014; P = .005). Of 280 368 paid claims,
21 271 (7.6%) exceeded $1 million (4304 of 69 617 [6.2%] in 1992-1996 and 4322 of 54 081
[8.0%] in 2009-2014), and 32.1% (35 293 of 109 865) involved a patient death. Diagnostic
error was the most common type of allegation, present in 31.8% (35 349 of 111 066) of paid
claims, ranging from 3.5% in anesthesiology (153 of 4317) to 87.0% in pathology (915 of
1052).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Between 1992 and 2014, the rate of malpractice claims paid
on behalf of physicians in the United States declined substantially. Mean compensation
amounts and the percentage of paid claims exceeding $1 million increased, with wide
differences in rates and characteristics across specialties. A better understanding of the
causes of variation among specialties in paid malpractice claims may help reduce both patient
injury and physicians’risk of liability.

I
n 1986, Congress created the National Practitioner Data
Bank (NPDB) to serve as a centralized database of malprac-
tice claims paid on behalf of US physicians.1 Since its in-
ception, the NPDB has contributed to our understanding of
national trends in medical malpractice payments and charac-
teristics of risk of liability for physicians. The lack of informa-
tion on physician specialties, however, has been a major limi-
tation of analyses relying on information in the NPDB.
Physicians’perceptions of their risk of liability influence
clinical decision making.2,3 A nationally representative analy-
sis of paid medical malpractice claims by specialty could
enable physicians to better understand their specific risk of
malpractice claims and shed light on areas where liability and
patient safety risks are the greatest. Previous efforts to pro-
vide specialty-level information on risk of liability have used
data from a single malpractice carrier,4,5 limited geographic
areas,6 or a single specialty.7,8 However, to our knowledge, to
date there has not been an analysis of malpractice trends by
specialty using nationally comprehensive data.
We newly linked all malpractice claims in the NPDB paid
on behalf of US physicians from 1992 to 2014 with physician
specialty and evaluated how liability characteristics vary by
specialty.Weevaluatedthefollowingattheaggregateleveland
specialty level: the annual rate of paid malpractice claims per
physician and changes in the rate over time, mean dollar
amount of paid claims, concentration of paid claims among a
limited number of physicians, frequency of catastrophic pay-
ments (ie, those exceeding $1 million),9 severity of patient
injury, and category of malpractice alleged.
Methods
Data Sources
The Division of Practitioner Data Banks, which is part of the
Health Resources and Services Administration, linked each
malpractice claim paid on behalf of a physician in the NPDB
with the physician’
s specialty, which was obtained from the
AmericanMedicalAssociationPhysicianMasterfile(AMAMas-
terfile). Paid malpractice claims were successfully matched
with physician specialty in 98% of cases. For physicians prac-
ticing in more than 1 specialty, we used the AMA’
s definition
of primary specialty, which is the specialty in which the phy-
sicians practiced the majority of their time.10 We grouped phy-
sicians into 24 specialty categories based on the AMA Master-
file classification scheme; these 24 classifications accounted
for 91% of all paid malpractice claims during the study pe-
riod. An “other” category captured the remaining physicians.11
The Partners HealthCare Institutional Review Board con-
cluded that the study did not constitute human participants
research and therefore approval was not needed.
Data Elements
The NPDB defines a paid claim as any payment made on be-
half of an individual physician in response to a written
request for compensation as part of a medical malpractice
claim. This payment may be the result of a court decision or a
negotiatedsettlement(whetherornotalawsuitwasfiled).Each
instanceofapaidclaimintheNPDBincludedtheyeartheclaim
was paid, payment amount, severity of injury, type of error al-
leged, and an encrypted physician identifier. Severity of in-
jury, ranging from emotional injury to death, was categorized
based on the National Association of Insurance Commission-
ers’(NAIC) Severity of Injury Scale, which is commonly used
in tort cases.12 The types of errors alleged spanned 11 catego-
ries: diagnosis related, medication related, treatment re-
lated, surgery related, anesthesia related, intravenous and
blood products related, obstetrics related, monitoring re-
lated, equipment or product related, behavioral health re-
lated, and other miscellaneous. For this analysis, the latter 7
categories were grouped together in an “other” category.
Statistical Analysis
Tocalculatetherateofpaidclaimsperphysician-year,thenum-
ber of physicians for whom a malpractice claim was paid in a
given year formed the numerator, and the number of physi-
cians in each specialty from the AMA Masterfile data in each
year from January 1, 1992, to December 31, 2013, formed the
denominator. Data on the number of physicians in each spe-
cialty for 2014 were unavailable and were imputed based on
a specialty’
s average rate of growth from 2010 to 2013.
To smooth annual fluctuations, we calculated the rate of
paid malpractice claims per 1000 physician-years in each spe-
cialty in 4 time intervals: 1992-1996, 1997-2002, 2003-2008,
and 2009-2014. We computed mean changes over time by
comparing the most recent time period (2009-2014) with the
earliest time period (1992-1996). We used t tests to determine
statistical significance. P < .05 (2-sided) was considered sta-
tisticallysignificant.Wedefinedcatastrophicpaymentsasthose
greater than $1 million because that amount is a common per-
incident limit of malpractice insurance policies, and prior re-
search has suggested that malpractice payments cluster at or
just below the limits of liability insurance.9,13 To account for
inflation, we adjusted all dollar amounts to 2014 dollars using
the Consumer Price Index.
To evaluate the concentration of paid malpractice claims
among physicians in each specialty (ie, to assess whether a few
physicians accounted for a disproportionate share of paid
claims), we summed the number of paid claims that each phy-
sician had from 1992 to 2014. Within each specialty, we then
Key Points
Questions What are the trends in paid medical malpractice claims
for physicians in the United States, and do they vary by specialty?
Findings This database study linked National Practitioner Data
Bank claims data with physician specialty and found that the
overall rate of claims paid on behalf of physicians deceased by
55.7% from 1992 to 2014. Mean compensation amounts and the
percentage of payments exceeding $1 million increased during that
time, with wide differences in rates and characteristics across
specialties.
Meaning A better understanding of the causes of variation among
specialties in paid malpractice claims may help reduce patient
injury and physicians’risk of liability.

identified physicians in the top 1% by number of paid claims.
We chose to analyze the top 1% of physicians with the great-
est number of paid claims based on prior research demonstrat-
ing that this group accrues an especially large proportion of
all paid claims.14
We categorized severity of injury into 4 groups: emo-
tional injury only or minor physical injury (NAIC scale, 1-3),
significant physical injury (NAIC scale, 4-6), major physical
injury (NAIC scale, 7-8), or death (NAIC scale, 9).15,16 We cat-
egorized types of alleged errors as diagnosis, surgery, medi-
cation or treatment, or other.17
Results
From 1992 to 2014, a total of 280 368 malpractice claims (for
175 667 physicians) were reported to the NPDB as paid on be-
half of physicians (Table 1). Across the estimated 19.9 million
physician-yearsinthestudy,theannualoverallrateofpaidmal-
practice claims was 14.1 per 1000 physician-years.
The rate of paid malpractice claims for all physicians de-
clined by 55.7%, from 20.1 per 1000 physician-years during
1992-1996, to 8.9 per 1000 physician-years during 2009-2014
(P < .001)(FigureandTable2).Thedecreaseoccurredacrossall
specialties,althoughthemagnitudeofthedeclinevariedmark-
edly by specialty, and was significant in each specialty except
cardiology. Pediatrics had the largest decline in paid malprac-
tice claims, at 75.8% (from 9.9 to 2.4 per 1000 physician-years;
P < .001), and cardiology had the smallest, at 13.5% (from 15.6
to 13.5 per 1000 physician-years; P = .15).
Among all paid claims, the mean payment was $329 565
(Table 3). Neurosurgery had the largest mean payment
($469 222) and dermatology had the smallest ($189 065). From
1992-1996 to 2009-2014, the mean payment, adjusted to
2014 dollars, increased by 23.3%, from $286 751 to $353 473
(P < .001). The increase in the mean payment varied by spe-
cialty and was significant for 16 of the 24 specialties. The in-
creases ranged from $17 431 in general practice (from $218 350
in 1992-1996 to $235 781 in 2009-2014; P = .36) to $138 708 in

tively,ofallpaidclaims.Withindermatology,thetop1%ofphy-
sicians had 14.4% of all paid claims (390 of 2712 claims; mean
of 2.82 paid claims per physician). Within urology, plastic sur-
gery, and ophthalmology, the top 1% of physicians incurred
more than 10% of all paid claims. Pathology and emergency
medicine had the lowest concentrations of paid claims, with
the top 1% of physicians incurring less than 5% of all paid
claims.
Paid malpractice claims exceeding $1 million (ie, cata-
strophic claims)9 comprised 7.6% (21 271 of 280 368) of paid
claims, and accounted for 6.2% (4304 of 69 617) of paid
claims in 1992-1996 and 8.0% (4322 of 54 081) in 2009-2014
(eTable in the Supplement). The percentage of catastrophic
claims increased over time in 23 of the 24 specialties, and
the increase was significant in 13 specialties. Neurosurgery
had the highest percentage of catastrophic payments (13.0%
[838 of 6468]), followed by obstetrics and gynecology (12.4%
[4946 of 39 897]) and neurology (11.8% [353 of 2986]); pedi-
atrics, pathology, and anesthesiology were also above 10%.
Plastic surgery had the lowest percentage of catastrophic
payments (2.7% [198 of 7352]).
Severity of patient injury varied considerably across spe-
cialties (Table 4). Of paid claims, 32.1% (35 293 of 109 865) in-
volved patient death, ranging from 2.7% (68 of 2481) for oph-
thalmologists to 64.8% (636 of 981) for pulmonologists. The
lowest severity of injury category, minor physical or emo-
tional injury, accounted for 13.6% (14 901 of 109 865) of paid
claims. Plastic surgery and dermatology had the highest per-
centages of paid claims falling into this lowest severity of
injury category (35.6% [907 of 2549] and 32.4% [298 of 919],
respectively); pulmonology had the lowest percentage (3.0%
[29 of 981]).
Across all paid claims, the most common type of allega-
tion was an error in diagnosis (31.8% [35 349 of 111 066]), fol-
lowed by errors related to surgery (26.9% [29 861 of 111 066]),
and errors related to medication or treatment (24.5% [27 153
of 111 066]). There were marked differences among special-
ties in the proportion of paid claims attributable to diagnostic
errors. The percentage of paid claims in which diagnostic er-
rorswereallegedwashighestinpathology(87.0%[915of1052])
and radiology (83.9% [4972 of 5923]), and lowest in anesthe-
siology (3.5% [153 of 4317]) and plastic surgery (4.3% [111 of
2569]). Plastic surgery had the highest percentage of paid
claims related to alleged surgical errors (73.3% [1882 of 2569]).
The specialties with the highest percentage of paid claims re-
lated to alleged errors in medication or treatment were psy-
chiatry (55.8% [737 of 1320]) and dermatology (45.1% [419 of
929]) followed by general practice (41.4% [582 of 1405]), car-
diology (40.0% [1449 of 3622]), and pulmonology (39.6% [390
of 986]). Anesthesiology and obstetrics and gynecology were
the only specialties with most paid claims in the other cat-
egory (66.5% [2872 of 4317] and 53.4% [7854 of 14 715], re-
spectively), which reflected the inclusion in the other cat-
egory of anesthesia-related claims (60.5% of overall claims in
anesthesia) and obstetrics-related claims (50.5% of overall
claims in obstetrics and gynecology).

that the rate of claims paid on behalf of all physicians de-
clined by 55.7% from 1992 to 2014, with considerable varia-
tion by specialty. Pediatricians had the largest decline (75.8%);
cardiologists had the smallest (13.5%).

rate of paid malpractice claims from 1994 to 2013,18 and an-
other found that decreases in paid claims occurred faster in
the inpatient than the outpatient setting.17 Neither study, how-
ever, evaluated paid claims by physician specialty at the na-
tional level.
Several factors may help to explain why the rate of claims
paid on behalf of physicians is declining. First, the passage of
traditionaltortreformsduringthisperiod—suchasdamagecaps
and statutes of limitation—is a possible explanation.18,19 Analy-
ses, however, have not found a consistent association be-
tweentraditionaltortreformsanddecreasesintheratesofpaid
claims.20-23 Second, improvements in patient safety would be
an encouraging explanation, although our findings cannot es-
tablish this fact. Certain measures, such as the use of
checklists24,25 and patient handoff protocols,26 have been
showntoenhancepatientsafety.Recentstudies,however,have
found that patient safety is still lacking in the US health care
system.27,28
Third, the manner by which institutions and insurers
resolve claims may be an explanation. Federal law1 only
requires that all written claims paid on behalf of physicians
be reported to the NPDB. A growing number of claims may
be settled on behalf of institutions alone, instead of indi-
vidual physicians, thereby not triggering the NPDB reporting
requirements.21,29,30 Critics have referred to this practice as
corporate shielding, and expressed the concern that it blunts
the ability to detect and track physicians with an excessive
number of negligent events.29,31 The extent of corporate
shielding is not known, including whether hospitals that
employ their physicians are more likely to shield them than
are other hospitals. It is also possible that an institution’
s
decision to assume liability was driven by a good-faith con-
clusion that the event giving rise to the paid claim was the
result of a systems problem, rather than the negligence of an
individual physician.
The fourth factor is the growing prevalence of communi-
cation and resolution (sometimes referred to as disclosure,
apology,andoffer)programs,throughwhichcompensationfor
an injury due to negligence may be provided without requir-
ingawrittenclaimfromapatient.18,32Asadoptionofthesepro-
grams increases, their effect will likely grow over time.
Consistent with recent research,14 we also found that a
small group of physicians in each specialty incur a dispropor-
tionately large share of paid claims, with variation across spe-
cialties. Although the specific reasons that these physicians in-
cur such a large share of claims are not known, potential

explanations include that they care for higher-risk patients,
practiceinhigher-liabilityriskenvironments,orrepeatedlypro-
vide substandard care (sometimes referred to as the bad apples
hypothesis6). National Practitioner Data Bank data alone can-
not definitively distinguish among these possibilities, which
would require detailed case-level assessment of the care pro-
vided, as well as risk adjustment.
Even though the number of paid claims declined during
the study period, the mean payment increased by 23.3% (ad-
justed for 2014 dollars) and varied by specialty. The reasons
are unclear, but may be related to plaintiffs’ attorneys
increasingly not taking cases with smaller potential pay-
ments because of either the risk of loss or the administrative
costs of bringing such a claim.15,33 One effect of some medi-
cal liability reforms, such as pretrial screening panels, is to
increase the administrative burden and costs of bringing a
claim,18,19 which could reinforce the selection pressure on
plaintiffs’ attorneys to avoid taking claims with smaller
expected payments. Smaller claims may also be settled ear-
lier, and outside of the written claims process, thereby leav-
ing only the larger claims in the database.
The percentage of paid claims exceeding $1 million sig-
nificantly increased in 13 of the 24 specialties, with an overall
absolutepercentageincreaseof1.8%.Verylargeawardsarerela-
tively infrequent and are often the result of payment for the
anticipatedongoingcareofapatientwithsevereinjuriesrather
than compensation for an egregious and negligent act. For ex-
ample, neurosurgery had the highest percentage of cata-
strophic claims, which may reflect the debilitating nature of
the injuries that can result from neurologic surgery rather than
the degree of negligence. Even though very large awards are
relatively infrequent, the prospect of facing a large award can
be stressful for physicians, especially if they fear a personal fi-
nancial toll.13,34 Although physicians infrequently pay a mal-
practice award out of pocket, our analysis suggests the need
for further study of trends in large payments.35 Caps on non-
economic (pain and suffering) damage do not bar large awards
tofullycompensatepatientsfortheiractualeconomiclosses.36
Although the most common type of allegation in the paid
claims was an error in diagnosis, it was the most common type
of malpractice alleged in only 9 of 24 specialties, most nota-
bly in pathology and radiology, likely reflecting the focus of
these specialties on the diagnostic process. The finding that
certain specialties had higher percentages of paid claims re-

which emphasized the limited epidemiologic understanding
of diagnostic errors.37
The variation in malpractice trends across specialties
presents an opportunity for further analysis to understand the
reasons and to identify strategies for improvement. For ex-
ample, cardiology had the smallest decrease in the rate of
paid claims, which may be associated with the increase in the
number of interventional cardiology procedures. One study
showed that 38.5% of all malpractice claims against cardiolo-
gists involved a procedure,8 and the volume of interventional

a Severity-of-injury outcomes and the current allegation type categories were
included in National Practitioner Data Bank malpractice payment reports
starting on January 31, 2004. From January 31, 2004, to December 31, 2014,
there were a total of 111 066 paid claims. For 1201 paid claims during this
period, the outcome was listed as unable to be determined, and so these
claims were excluded from the outcomes analysis.
bMinor physical or emotional injury was defined as scores of 1-3 on the National
Association of Insurance Commissioners’scale, significant physical injury as
scores of 4-6, major physical injury as scores of 7 or 8, and death as a
score of 9.

cardiology procedures increased during the study period.38,39
Another analysis found an increase in the number of malprac-
ticecasesassociatedwithcardiaccatheterizationbetween1990
and 2009.40
More generally, specialty-specific information about paid
claimsmayhelpinformdecisionsabouttheapproachesneeded
to simultaneously improve patient safety and reduce liabil-
ity. For example, a multifaceted patient safety program within
obstetrics was developed by targeting high-risk liability areas
and significantly reduced malpractice claims and the amount
paid on claims.41 Many aspects of this program—including the
development of protocols and guidelines, team training, re-
view of adverse events by a patient safety committee, and es-
tablishing a system for anonymous event reporting—can and
have been applied to other specialties.42
Limitations
Our analysis has several limitations. First, because the NPDB
contains only claims that result in payment on behalf of a phy-
sician in response to a written claim, we were unable to count
claimsforwhichnopaymentwasmade,thatweresettledwith-
out a written demand, or those in which payment was made
solely on behalf of an institution. Second, some claims paid on
behalf of physicians may not be reported to the NPDB, despite
thelegalrequirementtodoso.However,onecomparisonofdata
on paid claims from a large malpractice insurer with data in the
NPDB found only a very small discrepancy, suggesting that un-
derreporting is not a major problem.4 Third, we used data from
the AMA Masterfile to determine the number of physicians in
each specialty in a given year, but these data do not account for
theclinicalvolumeofthephysician,whichcouldaffectthephy-
sician’
s liability exposure. Fourth, the dates of reports to the
NPDB are based on when the judgment or settlement leading
to payment was made. Typically, the time elapsed between an
injury occurring and resolution of the claim is 4 to 5 years,15,43
suggesting that NPDB data may be a lagging indicator of trends
in paid claims and types of alleged injuries.
Conclusions
From 1992 to 2014, there was a marked reduction in the rate
of malpractice claims paid on behalf of physicians, with a
concurrent increase in both mean payment amounts (ad-
justed to 2014 dollars) and the rate of catastrophic payments.
There were wide differences in rates of paid claims and char-
acteristics of the alleged injuries across specialties. A better
understanding of the causes of variation among specialties in
paid malpractice claims may help reduce patient injury and
physicians’risk of liability.
