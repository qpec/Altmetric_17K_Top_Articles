Abstract
Myopia (nearsightedness) is the most common eye disorder, which is rapidly becoming one
of the leading causes of vision loss in several parts of the world because of a recent sharp
increase in prevalence. Nearwork, which produces hyperopic optical defocus on the retina,
has been implicated as one of the environmental risk factors causing myopia in humans.
Experimental studies have shown that hyperopic defocus imposed by negative power
lenses placed in front of the eye accelerates eye growth and causes myopia, whereas myo-
pic defocus imposed by positive lenses slows eye growth and produces a compensatory
hyperopic shift in refractive state. The balance between these two optical signals is thought
to regulate refractive eye development; however, the ability of the retina to recognize the
sign of optical defocus and the composition of molecular signaling pathways guiding emme-
tropization are the subjects of intense investigation and debate. We found that the retina can
readily distinguish between imposed myopic and hyperopic defocus, and identified key sig-
naling pathways underlying retinal response to the defocus of different signs. Comparison of
retinal transcriptomes in common marmosets exposed to either myopic or hyperopic defo-
cus for 10 days or 5 weeks revealed that the primate retina responds to defocus of different
signs by activation or suppression of largely distinct pathways. We also found that 29 genes
differentially expressed in the marmoset retina in response to imposed defocus are localized
within human myopia quantitative trait loci (QTLs), suggesting functional overlap between
genes differentially expressed in the marmoset retina upon exposure to optical defocus and
genes causing myopia in humans. These findings identify retinal pathways involved in the
development of myopia, as well as potential new strategies for its treatment.
Author summary
The worldwide prevalence of myopia is predicted to increase from the current 23% to
about 50% in the next three decades. Although much effort has been directed towards

 elucidating the mechanisms underlying refractive eye development and myopia, treat-
ment options for myopia are mostly limited to optical correction, which does not prevent
progression of myopia nor the pathological blinding complications often associated with
the disease. Several experimental optics-based treatments have had only limited effect on
myopia progression, and currently available drug treatments are limited and the mecha-
nisms of action are not well understood. The development of safe and effective pharmaco-
logical treatments for myopia is urgently needed to prevent the impending myopia
epidemic. The main obstacles that prevent the development of anti-myopia drugs are the
uncertainties regarding the mechanisms controlling eye growth and optical development,
including the molecular signaling pathways underlying it. In this study, we show that,
contrary to the conventional thinking that myopic and hyperopic defocus trigger opposite
changes in the same genes and pathways to guide postnatal eye growth, defocus of oppo-
site signs affect eye growth via largely distinct retinal pathways. Knowing that myopic and
hyperopic defocus signals drive eye growth in opposite directions and propagate via dif-
ferent pathways provides a framework for the development of new anti-myopia drugs.
Myopia can be controlled pharmacologically by stimulating pathways underlying the reti-
nal response to positive lenses and/or by suppressing pathways underlying the retinal
response to negative lenses.
Introduction
Myopia (nearsightedness) is an eye disorder characterized by blurred distance vision caused
by negative refractive errors when the eye grows too long for its optical power. It is widespread
[1], and the prevalence has been increasing around the world at an alarming rate, reaching
80%–90% in several parts of Asia [2–5]. Because of the increasing prevalence, myopia is rapidly
becoming one of the leading causes of vision loss in several parts of the world, as the excessive
eye growth associated with it often leads to serious vision-threatening complications, such as
myopic maculopathy, chorioretinal atrophy, retinal tears, retinal detachment, myopic macular
degeneration, and glaucoma [1,6–8]. It is estimated that 4.8 billion people (half of the world’s
population) will be affected by myopia by 2050 [9], predicting an impending public health cri-
sis. The World Health Organization designated myopia as one of five priority health condi-
tions [10,11].
Developmental studies in humans and a wide variety of animals show that eyes grow into
focus postnatally through a process called emmetropization. During emmetropization, the
axial length of the eye grows to match its optical power, producing focused images on the ret-
ina; a mismatch between the optical power of the eye and its axial length leads to the develop-
ment of hyperopia if eyes are too short for their optical power or myopia if eyes grow too long
for their optical power. Visual experience is critical for this process, suggesting that postnatal
eye growth is guided by visual feedback related to retinal defocus. Experimental studies in
many animal species confirm the role of optical defocus in emmetropization, with observa-
tions that the eye can compensate for either imposed hyperopic or imposed myopic defocus by
either increasing or decreasing its growth rate [12–26]. Myopia can be induced in species as
diverse as primates, tree shrews, guinea pigs, mice, chickens, and fish by placing a negative
lens in front of the eye and imposing hyperopic defocus on the retina [13,16,20,21,23,25–28].
Imposing myopic defocus on the retina with positive lenses, on the other hand, inhibits eye
growth and produces a compensatory hyperopic shift in refraction in fish [28], chickens
[21,23], and several mammalian species, including primates [13,16,18,20,25,26]. The balanced

 response to these two optical signals of opposite signs seems to be regulating eye growth and
refractive development. Moreover, animal experiments in which the optic nerve was sectioned
[29–31] and in which different parts of the retina were simultaneously exposed to the defocus
of opposite signs [32–34] suggested that the process of emmetropization is largely controlled
locally by the retina.
A number of studies have explored the cellular and molecular mechanisms of emmetropiza-
tion, and while these studies have hinted at the involvement of various factors and pathways
[35–44], the field has made only incremental gains and has been at a conceptual standstill for
some time. Very little is actually known about the biological signaling that underlies the eye’s
response to different signs of optical defocus, and the ability of the retina to detect the sign of
defocus has been the subject of much controversy because of the lack of direct evidence for the
underlying mechanism [19,45,46]. Essentially, two alternative models for the visual control of
emmetropization have been proposed. In the first model, the rate of eye growth is regulated by
the amount of retinal blur, regardless of the sign of defocus. In this model, more blur promotes
more growth, and imposed hyperopic or myopic defocus could be compensated for appropri-
ately because hyperopic eyes generally experience more defocus than myopic eyes, which expe-
rience some focus at near. If the retina indeed could not distinguish between myopic and
hyperopic defocus, both imposed myopic and hyperopic defocus would be expected to affect
expression of the same genes in the same direction. The second model suggests that postnatal
eye growth is controlled by the sign of retinal defocus and that response to defocus is bidirec-
tional, i.e., myopic defocus actively reduces growth and hyperopic defocus actively increases
growth. This could be controlled by one controller that modulates growth rate or two separate
controllers that work independently to increase or decrease growth. In the latter case, emme-
tropization is achieved through the balance between the two independent outputs. If this
model is true, then imposed myopic and hyperopic defocus would be expected to modulate
the expression of the same genes in opposite directions or affect expression of different sets of
genes.
In this study, we analyzed whole-genome gene expression using massive parallel RNA
sequencing (RNA-seq) in the retina of a New World primate, common marmosets (Callithrix
jacchus), exposed to either myopic or hyperopic defocus. We demonstrate that primate retina
(1) can distinguish between hyperopic and myopic optical defocus, and (2) responds to the dif-
ferent signs of defocus by activation or suppression of largely distinct pathways. These data
support the hypothesis that emmetropization is regulated bidirectionally by two separate reti-
nal controllers: one that involves active stimulation of eye growth by hyperopic defocus and
another that actively suppresses eye growth in response to myopic defocus. We refer to this
mechanism as Bidirectional Emmetropization by the Sign of Optical Defocus (BESOD). Fur-
thermore, we identified key signaling pathways underlying the retinal responses to the defocus
of different signs, which offer possible targets that can be manipulated pharmacologically to
suppress myopia. These results establish the critical role of the retina in the control of postnatal
eye growth and emmetropization, and provide a framework for the development of drugs that
can be used to treat myopia and help prevent the blinding complications associated with it.
Results
Optical defocus induces large-scale changes in gene expression and affects
numerous cellular functions and signaling pathways in the retina
The eyes of common marmosets compensate for optical defocus imposed by either negative or
positive lenses by increasing or decreasing axial growth and developing myopic or hyperopic
refractive errors, respectively [15,16,25,26]. To investigate the retina’s molecular responses to

 different signs of defocus, we analyzed changes in the whole-genome transcriptome in the ret-
ina of common marmosets (C. jacchus) exposed to myopic or hyperopic defocus using +5D or
−5D single vision contact lenses, respectively. We applied the lenses to the right eye of 10–
11-week-old (mean 74 ± 5 days) marmosets for 10 days to examine the effect of the initial
exposure to retinal defocus, or for 5 weeks to explore the retinal responses when measurable
changes in eye growth and refractive state typically just begin to be detected [25]. The left eye
served as a control and was fitted with a plano contact lens (Fig 1). Table 1 provides descriptive
optometric data of the subjects under each condition. The lens-imposed retinal defocus (the
effective refractive error measured through the lens at the end of the rearing period) provides a
measure of the average retinal defocus experienced by the subjects in each group at the time of
the tissue collection. It shows that the +5D lenses imposed myopic defocus and the −5D lenses
imposed hyperopic defocus after 10 days (early response) and 5 weeks (sustained response) of
lens wear. As expected from earlier studies [25], there was little if any compensation for the

point behind the retina and produce hyperopic defocus, which stimulates eye growth (dashed line).

 imposed defocus observed for these treatment durations, as seen from the average interocular
differences in spherical equivalent refractive error or vitreous chamber depth between the
experimental and control eyes.
Following lens treatment, retinae were collected and used to perform whole-genome gene
expression profiling using RNA-seq. In the eyes treated with −5D lenses for 10 days, a total of
119 genes, organized into 6 genetic networks, were differentially expressed, compared with
controls (Fig 2A and 2B; S1 and S5 Tables; S1 Fig). Specifically, 87 genes were up-regulated
and 32 genes were down-regulated. After 5 weeks of exposure to −5D lenses, 309 genes were
differentially expressed compared to controls, and these genes were organized into 17 genetic
networks (Fig 2E and 2F; S2 and S6 Tables; S2–S4 Figs): 106 genes were up-regulated and 203
genes were down-regulated. In the +5D-lens-treated animals, 79 genes, organized into 4
genetic networks, were differentially expressed after 10 days (Fig 3A and 3B; S3 and S7 Tables;
S5 Fig), and 740 genes, organized into 25 genetic networks, were differentially expressed after
5 weeks of treatment (Fig 3E and 3F; S4 and S8 Tables; S6–S10 Figs), compared with the con-
trol eyes. In the animals treated with +5D lenses, a total of 53 genes were up-regulated and 26
genes were down-regulated after 10 days, whereas 507 genes were up-regulated and 233 genes
were down-regulated after 5 weeks of treatment.
In terms of the numbers of differentially expressed genes, negative-lens-imposed hyperopic
defocus induced a stronger response at the level of gene expression compared to the positive-
lens-imposed myopic defocus during the first 10 days of treatment, while positive lenses elic-
ited a substantially stronger response compared to negative lenses after 5 weeks of treatment.
Gene ontology (GO) analysis revealed that optical defocus affects numerous cellular func-
tions, with noticeable differences between marmoset eyes exposed to negative and positive
lenses, as well as between treatment durations of 10 days and 5 weeks (Fig 2C and 2G; S9 and
S10 Tables; Fig 3C and 3G; S11 and S12 Tables). This initial observation was further reinforced
by the analysis of canonical pathways affected by the positive and negative lenses (Fig 2D and
2H; S13 and S14 Tables; Fig 3D and 3H; S15 and S16 Tables). We found that the early response
(10 days) to hyperopic defocus imposed by −5D lenses primarily involved pathways regulating
glycogen degradation, ephrin and reelin signaling, as well as biosynthesis of spermine and cho-
line (Fig 2D; S13 Table), while the sustained response (5 weeks) involved activation of ß-adren-
ergic signaling and suppression of cAMP-mediated signaling, protein kinase A signaling,
calcium signaling, androgen signaling, and dopamine-DARPP32 feedback signaling, among
several other pathways (Fig 2H; S14 Table). On the other hand, the early response to myopic
defocus imposed by +5D lenses primarily involved phenylalanine degradation and RANK,
SAPK/JNK, NGF, and gap junction signaling (Fig 3D; S15 Table), while the sustained response
involved activation of EIF2, Notch, JAK/Stat, oncostatin M, somatostatin receptor 2, interleu-
kin, CNTF, CREB, α-adrenergic, integrin, and ceramide signaling as well as suppression of
apoptosis and aldosterone signaling (Fig 3H; S16 Table). Collectively, these results demon-
strate that optical defocus causes large-scale changes in gene expression controlling metabo-
lism and cell signaling in the retina, and that there are substantial differences in the retinal
response to hyperopic and myopic defocus.
There is very little overlap between genes differentially expressed in
response to hyperopic or myopic defocus after 10 days or 5 weeks
Taking into account the differences in GO functions and signaling pathways involved in the
defocus response in the four experimental groups, we additionally performed a systematic
comparison of cellular functions and canonical pathways affected in the different experimental
groups (Figs 4 and 5; S9–S20 Tables). This analysis revealed that each experimental condition

 leads to differential expression of a unique set of genes, with very little overlap between the
datasets (Fig 4A and 4C; Fig 5A and 5C). There was only an eight-gene overlap between the
+5D/10-days group and the +5D/5-weeks group, with three genes (PIK3R2, OGFRL1, and
NSA2) exhibiting differential expression in opposite directions (Fig 4B; S17 Table). Six genes
were common between the −5D/10-days and −5D/5-weeks groups, with all genes expressed in
the same direction in both groups (Fig 4D; S18 Table). Three genes were common between the
−5D/10-days and +5D/10-days groups, all expressed in the same direction (Fig 5B; S19 Table),
indicating that they were sensitive to defocus but not to the sign of defocus. However, 13 out
of 18 genes, which were common between the −5D/5-weeks and +5D/5-weeks groups, exhib-
ited sign-of-defocus–specific expression (Fig 5D; S20 Table). These included nine coding
genes (ZC3H11A, TRIM23, STARD3NL, RCBTB1, PPP2CA, LOC100394842,CUL3, COMMD3,
ACTR8) and four long noncoding RNAs (LOC103794697,LOC100396694,LOC100394543,
LOC100392587).Thus, these data reveal that hyperopic and myopic defocus affect the expres-
sion of largely different genes in the retina. Very few genes are affected by both hyperopic and
myopic defocus and change direction of expression in response to the defocus of different
sign.
Early and sustained retinal responses to defocus are guided by largely
distinct pathways
GO analysis showed that the early (10 days) and sustained (5 weeks) response to defocus
involved largely the same cellular functions (albeit to a different extent) (Fig 4E and 4F; S9–
S12 Tables); however, there were several cellular functions unique to the sustained response to
defocus (Fig 4E and 4F; S9–S12 Tables). Specifically, the response to 5 weeks of myopic defo-
cus imposed by +5D lenses (associated with reduced axial eye growth) involved changes in
metabolism, cell signaling, protein trafficking, and posttranslational modification of proteins
(Fig 4E; S11 and S12 Tables), whereas the sustained response to hyperopic defocus imposed by
−5D lenses (associated with increased axial eye growth) involved substantial increase in gene
expression, protein trafficking, and vitamin and mineral metabolism (Fig 4F; S9 and S10
Tables). Moreover, pathway analysis revealed almost complete transition from one set of path-
ways to another between 10 days of treatment and 5 weeks of treatment for both −5D and +5D
experimental groups (Fig 4G and 4H; S13–S16 Tables). For myopic defocus imposed by posi-
tive lenses, the most prominent change is a transition from RANK, SAPK/JNK, NGF, and gap
junction signaling to protein ubiquitination pathway, Notch signaling, glutamate receptor sig-
naling, oncostatin M signaling, α-adrenergic signaling, and ephrin B signaling (Fig 4G; S15
and S16 Tables). For hyperopic defocus imposed by negative lenses, there is an apparent tran-
sition from ephrin A and reelin signaling to ß-adrenergic signaling, Gα12/13 signaling, cal-
cium signaling, glutamate receptor signaling, TNFR1 signaling, HIPPO signaling, RAN
signaling, NOS signaling, synaptic long-term potentiation, relaxin signaling, and dopamine
receptor signaling (Fig 4H; S13 and S14 Tables). In summary, there is almost complete transi-
tion from one set of pathways to another over time when the retina responds to sustained opti-
cal defocus.

 Different pathways guide retinal responses to hyperopic and myopic
defocus associated with changes in eye growth
Comparison of the cellular functions affected by different defocus in the −5D and +5D experi-
mental groups revealed that although most cellular functions affected by imposed hyperopic
or myopic defocus were the same (Fig 5E and 5F; S9–S12 Tables), there was a clear increase in
gene expression during the first 10 days after exposure to myopic defocus imposed by +5D
lenses and a substantial increase in RNA trafficking and RNA posttranscriptional modifica-
tions after exposure to +5D lenses in both 10-days and 5-weeks groups (Fig 5E and 5F; S9–S12
Tables), indicating that alternative splicing and isoform switching play important roles in the
eye’s response to positive lenses. Furthermore, pathway analysis revealed that positive and neg-
ative lenses influenced different sets of pathways (Fig 5G and 5H; S13–S16 Tables).
During the first 10 days, the retina responded to hyperopic defocus imposed by −5D lenses
with changes in glycogen and S-methyl-50-thioadenosine degradation, spermine and choline
biosynthesis, and ephrin receptor signaling, whereas myopic defocus imposed by +5D lenses
caused changes in phenylalanine degradation, RANK, NGF, and gap junction signaling (Fig
5G; S13 and S15 Tables).
Five weeks of exposure to optical defocus resulted in large-scale changes in retinal signaling.
The −5D-lens-imposed hyperopic defocus primarily affected ß-adrenergic and cAMP-medi-
ated signaling, tRNA splicing, protein kinase A signaling, Gα12/13 signaling, calcium signal-
ing, dopamine-DARPP32 feedback signaling, G-protein coupled receptor signaling, glutamine
biosynthesis, nNOS signaling, RAN, HIPPO, and TNFR1 signaling as well as the Wnt/Ca+
pathway, among others (Fig 5H; S14 and S16 Tables). Retinal response to 5 weeks of myopic
defocus imposed by +5D lenses involved protein translation and protein ubiquitination path-
ways, oncostatin M and somatostatin receptor 2 signaling, CNTF signaling, aldosterone signal-
ing, JAK/Stat signaling, ephrin B signaling, integrin signaling, interleukin signaling, Notch
signaling, α-adrenergic signaling, glucocorticoid receptor signaling, and mTOR signaling,
among several other pathways (Fig 5H; S14 and S16 Tables).
Taken together, these data suggest that postnatal eye growth and refractive development are
regulated by a bidirectional mechanism that involves active stimulation of eye growth by
hyperopic defocus and active suppression of eye growth by myopic defocus, through largely
independent pathways.
Many genes differentially expressed in response to optical defocus in
marmosets localize within human myopia QTLs
Genes comprising signaling pathways that underlie physiological processes are often targeted
by mutations, causing human diseases. To identify candidate genes involved in myopia devel-
opment in humans, we compared the genes differentially expressed in the marmoset retina in
response to imposed defocus with a list of genes located within QTLs found to be associated
with myopia in the human population (S21 Table) [47]. This analysis revealed that a total of 29
differential genes identified in this study were localized within 24 human myopia QTLs (Fig 6;
S22–S24 Tables), including two genes differentially expressed in the −5D/10-days group (Fig

 mapping studies in humans and genes differentially expressed in the marmoset retina upon
exposure to optical defocus. These data also suggest that approximately 24% of the human
QTLs may be associated with genetic variations in the genes identified in marmosets as regu-
lating retinal response to defocus.
Discussion
While there is plentiful evidence that eye growth can be modulated by imposed optical defocus
of different signs, there remains little consensus regarding the mechanism underlying the eye’s
sensitivity to the sign of optical defocus. Nevin and colleagues [24] reported that preventing
access to sharp vision prevented refractive compensation for the sign of defocus, arguing that
eye growth responds to blur and not the sign of defocus. Conversely, other findings support
the alternative view that the eye can detect the sign of defocus and adjust its growth accord-
ingly to compensate for either hyperopic or myopic defocus even when imposed on an image
that is significantly blurred, indirectly supporting the BESOD model of emmetropization [48–
50]. Furthermore, the sign-of-defocus–sensitive expression of the retinal transcription factor
ZENK/Egr1 led to the hypothesis that both myopic and hyperopic defocus would affect expres-
sion of the same genes in the retina but in opposite direction, presumably activating or sup-
pressing a single pathway controlling eye growth [51].
Our data provide direct evidence that the retina detects myopic and hyperopic defocus sep-
arately through largely distinct and independent pathways, supporting the existence of
BESOD (Fig 7). Furthermore, we found that there is very little overlap between the genes and
pathways underlying response to the myopic defocus and the genes and pathways underlying
response to the hyperopic defocus. We found only 13 genes that exhibited sign-of-defocus–
sensitive expression, i.e., ACTR8, COMMD3, CUL3, LOC100392587,LOC100394543,
LOC100394842,LOC100396694,LOC103794697,PPP2CA, RCBTB1, STARD3NL, TRIM23, and
ZC3H11A. These genes represent about 1% of all genes affected by the optical defocus in the
retina, and we speculate that they may act as switches that trigger largely distinct sign-of-defo-
cus–specific signaling cascades underlying BESOD.
Our findings also support the existence of a switch from one set of genes to another when
the retina transitions from an early response to defocus to a later, possibly sustained, response.
There was almost complete transition from one set of pathways at 10 days to different path-
ways after 5 weeks of treatment with both myopic and hyperopic defocus imposed by the posi-
tive and negative lenses, respectively. The transition from the early response to the later
response in the retinae exposed to myopic defocus was associated with significant changes in
cell signaling, protein synthesis and degradation, posttranslational modification of proteins,
protein trafficking, and energy production. This was accompanied by the transition from the
pathways regulating phenylalanine degradation, RANK, SAPK/JNK, NGF, and gap junction
signaling to the pathways that regulate ephrin B, α-adrenergic, iNOS, fatty acid α-oxidation,
oncostatin M, glutamate receptor, Notch, and protein ubiquitination signaling, among other
pathways. In the retinae exposed to hyperopic defocus, transition from the early response to
the later response was associated with changes in gene expression, protein trafficking, and vita-
min and mineral metabolism. It was accompanied by the transition from the pathways regulat-
ing glycogen degradation, spermine and spermidine biosynthesis, ephrin A and reelin
signaling to the pathways that control synaptic long-term potentiation and phototransduction
as well as dopamine receptor, TNFR1, HIPPO, RAN, nNOS, glutamate receptor, calcium, and
ß-adrenergic signaling, among other pathways. We also found that although response to nega-
tive lenses appeared to be stronger compared to positive lenses during the first 10 days of expo-
sure, positive lenses elicited a substantially stronger response at the level of gene expression

 after 5 weeks of treatment. This suggests that the time course of retinal response to hyperopic
and myopic defocus might be slightly different and that positive lenses ultimately may have
greater impact on eye growth than negative lenses.
Our data also suggest that positive and negative lenses affect different sets of genes and
pathways. The most significant differences between positive and negative lenses after 10 days
of treatment were related to the cellular functions underlying RNA trafficking and RNA splic-
ing, which may indicate that initial exposure to defocus activates a large-scale switch from one
set of protein isoforms to another. Moreover, negative lenses primarily affected glycogen deg-
radation, spermine and spermidine biosynthesis, and ephrin A and reelin signaling, whereas
positive lenses induced changes in gap junction, NGF, and RANK signaling as well as phenyl-
alanine degradation. Positive and negative lenses also affected significantly different cellular
functions and pathways after 5 weeks of treatment. The largest difference between the 5-weeks
groups were significant changes in RNA trafficking and splicing induced by positive lenses,
which again suggests a large-scale switch from one set of protein isoforms to another. While
negative lenses primarily affected pathways regulating ß-adrenergic signaling, cAMP-mediated
signaling, calcium signaling, dopamine signaling, G-protein coupled receptor signaling, gluta-
mine biosynthesis, nNOS signaling, RAN signaling, HIPPO signaling, TNFR1 signaling, Wnt/
Ca+ pathway, and synaptic long-term potentiation, positive lenses caused changes in pathways
regulating protein ubiquitination, fatty acid α-oxidation, and tryptophan degradation as well
as EIF2, oncostatin M, CNTF, aldosterone, JAK/Stat, ephrin B, integrin, Notch, glucocorticoid
receptor, mTOR, iNOS, and α-adrenergic signaling, among other pathways.
Although many pathways that we found to underlie the retinal responses to defocus are
novel, there are several pathways that had previously been implicated in the development of
myopia. For example, a mutation in the gene NDUFAF7, which encodes a mitochondrial
reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) dehydrogenase complex assembly factor,
was associated with pathological myopia in humans, implicating mitochondrial dysfunction in
refractive error development [55]. Protein ubiquitination may be associated with myopia
development, because a loss-of-function mutation in the E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase UBE3B
was shown to cause Kaufman oculocerebrofacial syndrome, which includes myopia as one its
prominent features [56]. Two genome-wide association studies found a strong association
between refractive error and GJD2, which encodes gap junction protein 2 expressed in the ret-
ina, suggesting that gap junction signaling may be involved in refractive eye development
[57,58]. Glutamate receptor signaling was found to be involved in myopia development by two
genetic linkage studies [58,59] and also in a study of a glutamate receptor Grik2 mouse
Fig 7. Summary of the key genes and pathways underlying BESOD. Our findings support the view that emmetropization is regulated by a bidirectional growth
control mechanism, which involves active stimulation of eye growth by hyperopic defocus and active suppression of eye growth by myopic defocus (first column). We
find that these two signals propagate in the retina via largely distinct (possibly even independent) pathways. Early response to optical defocus involves different sets of
genes, with no genes exhibiting sign-of-defocus–sensitive expression. Although the sustained response also involves largely different sets of genes, several genes (listed in
the second column) exhibit sign-of-defocus–sensitive expression. We speculate that they may act as switches that trigger largely distinct sign-of-defocus–specific
signaling cascades underlying response to the defocus of opposite signs. We identified a total of 819 genes differentially expressed in the retina exposed to myopic
defocus and 428 genes differentially expressed in the retina exposed to hyperopic defocus. The top five up- and down-regulated genes in each condition are shown in the
third column. Some of over 100 canonical pathways involved in the regulation of the retinal response to defocus of opposite signs are listed in the fourth column. Three
pathways have been previously targeted pharmacologically for myopia control (fifth column): (1) dopamine signaling was suggested to be a target for apomorphine,
reserpine, and 6-OHDA [52]; (2) nitric oxide signaling was implicated in the anti-myopic atropine effect [53]; and (3) α-adrenergic signaling was suggested to be a target
of atropine, oxyphenonium, and pirenzepine [54]. BESOD, Bidirectional Emmetropization by the Sign of Optical Defocus; cAMP, cyclic adenosine monophosphate;

 knockout model [36]. Aspartate receptors were implicated in myopia development by at least
two studies [60,61]. Nitric oxide and cAMP signaling were also suggested to play a role in the
development of myopia by several studies in chickens [37–39]. Dopamine signaling has long
been associated with experimental myopia and refractive eye development [40]. Riddell and
colleagues also found that pathways regulating apoptosis, oxidative phosphorylation, and mes-
enchymal development are involved in refractive development in chickens and humans
[41,43]. Our finding that myopic and hyperopic defocus signals driving eye growth in opposite
directions propagated via largely different retinal pathways is supported by several functional
studies, which found that pharmacological agents that inhibit negative-lens-induced myopia
are completely different from those inhibiting positive-lens-induced hyperopia [62–64]. More-
over, the temporal features of flickering light that suppress refractive error development are
different for imposed myopia and hyperopia [65]. We also note that many of the genes chang-
ing expression in response to retinal defocus in this study are localized within human QTLs
linked to myopia. This strongly suggests that there is a functional overlap between the genes
that regulate retinal response to defocus and the genes that cause human myopia.
What creates conditions for the development of myopia and why myopia progresses in
some individuals and not in others remain important topics of further research. Several treat-
ment options for myopia, such as optical correction using spectacles, multifocal contact lenses,
or atropine, are available, but efficacy is limited [66–72]. The identification of drug targets and
the development of suitable drugs that can be used to suppress or possibly even reverse the
progression of myopia require a deeper understanding of the signaling pathways underlying
the ocular response to optical defocus of different signs. The results of this study show that the
retina can distinguish between myopic and hyperopic defocus and responds to defocus of
opposite signs by activating largely distinct pathways. Identification of these pathways provides
a framework for understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the visual control of
emmetropization and the identification of new drug targets for the development of more effec-
tive treatment options for myopia.
Materials and methods
Ethics statement
Marmosets were bred and raised in the animal care facilities at the New England College of
Optometry and at the State University of New York, College of Optometry, according to the
United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) standards for animal care and use, and fully
complied with the guidelines outlined in the Weatherall report on the use of nonhuman pri-
mates in research. All procedures also adhered to the Association for Research in Vision and
Ophthalmology (ARVO) statement for the use of animals in ophthalmic and vision research
and were approved by the New England College of Optometry and SUNY College of Optome-
try Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees (Protocol Nos. DT-1.10.07 and DT-2011-
06-1, respectively). Animals were anesthetized via intramuscular injection of alfaxalone (1.5
mg/kg) and were humanely killed by intracardiac pentobarbital (100 mg/kg) overdose while
under deep surgical anesthesia.
Animals and lens treatment
Twelve common marmosets (C. jacchus) were used in this study. Marmosets were housed
under lighting provided from daylight balanced fluorescent lamps on a 10-hour:14-hour light-
dark cycle. Temperature was maintained at 75 ± 2˚F with 45% ± 5% humidity. Food and water
were provided ad libitum within the home cage and consisted of a formulated dry pellet
(Mazuri New World Diet, Mazuri Exotic Animal Nutrition, St. Louis, MO) with regularly

 varied supplements of fresh fruit and protein. Custom-made soft single vision contact lenses
were used to impose defocus. Animals of both sexes, which were 74 ± 5 days old at the begin-
ning of the experiment, were fitted with either a +5D (imposed myopic defocus) or −5D
(imposed hyperopic defocus) contact lens on one eye for either 10 days or 5 weeks. The contra-
lateral eye wore a plano lens and was used as an interocular control. All lenses were inserted at
the beginning of the light period and removed daily at the beginning of the dark period.
Changes in axial eye growth and refractive state were measured at the onset and at the end of
lens treatment. Refractive state was measured by retinoscopy and Hartinger coincidence
refractometry following cycloplegia with 1% cyclopentolate. Refractive state was taken as the
average of the spherical equivalents from both measures. Axial length was measured with A-
scan ultrasonography and reported as changes in vitreous chamber depth (on-axis distance
from the posterior surface of the crystalline lens to the inner surface of the retina). Our goal
was to explore gene expression during detection of and active compensation for imposed defo-
cus, when biometric changes cannot be readily detected. Our selection of the 10-day and
5-week rearing durations was guided by our previously reported data from two independent
groups of age-matched marmosets (eight animals each), which were raised exposed to either
imposed myopic defocus (with +5D lenses) or imposed hyperopic defocus (with −5D lenses)
until they achieved full compensation. In these animals, we obtained the time course of
changes in refractive state and depth of vitreous chamber in response to the imposed myopic
and hyperopic defocus. See Ref. [25] for details.
RNA extraction and RNA-seq
After lens treatments, animals were humanely killed following IACUC-approved protocols.
Both lens-treated and control eyes were enucleated, the retinae were dissected from the enucle-
ated eyes, and the choroid/RPE was removed. The retinae were washed in RNAlater (Thermo
Fisher Scientific, Grand Island, NY) for 5 minutes, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at
−80˚C until processed for this study. To isolate RNA, tissue samples were homogenized at 4˚C
in a lysis buffer using Bead Ruptor 24 tissue homogenizer (Omni, Kennesaw, GA). Total RNA
was extracted from each tissue sample using miRNAeasy mini kit (QIAGEN, Germantown,
MD) following the manufacturer’s protocol. The integrity of RNA was confirmed by analyzing
260/280 nm ratios (Ratio260/280 = 2.11–2.13) on a Nanodrop (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Grand
Island, NY) and the RNA Integrity Number (RIN = 9.0–10.0) using Agilent Bioanalyzer (Agi-
lent, Santa Clara, CA). Illumina sequencing libraries were constructed from 1 μg of total RNA
using the TruSeq Stranded Total RNA LT kit with the Ribo-Zero Gold ribosomal RNA deple-
tion module (Illumina, San Diego, CA). The libraries, each containing a specific index (bar-
code), were pooled at equal concentrations using the randomized complete block (RCB)
experimental design before sequencing on Illumina HiSeq 2500 sequencing system (Illumina,
San Diego, CA). The number of libraries per multiplexed sample was adjusted to ensure
sequencing depth of about 70 million reads per library (paired-end, 2 × 100 nucleotides). The
actual sequencing depth was 70,851,538 ± 10,430,968 with read quality score 39.7 ± 0.2.
Post-sequencing RNA-seq data validation and analysis
The FASTQ raw data files generated by the Illumina sequencing system were imported into
Partek Flow software package (version 6.0.17.0723, Partek, St. Louis, MO), libraries were sepa-
rated based on their barcodes, adapters were trimmed, and remaining sequences were sub-
jected to pre-alignment quality control using Partek Flow pre-alignment QA/QC module.
After the assessment of various quality metrics, bases with the quality score <37 were removed
(�5 bases) from each read. Sequencing reads were then mapped to the marmoset reference

 genome C. jacchus 3.2.1 (NCBI) using the STAR aligner (version 2.5.2b), resulting in 85.9% ±
2.4% mapped reads per library, which covered 36.9% ± 1.8% of the genome. Aligned reads
were quantified to transcriptome using Partek E/M annotation model and the NCBI C. jacchus
3.2.1 annotation GFF file to determine read counts per gene/genomic region. The generated
read counts were normalized by the total read count and subjected to the Partek Flow Gene
Specific Analysis (GSA) to detect differentially expressed transcripts. Data were simultaneously
fitted with Normal, Lognormal, Lognormal with shrinkage, Negative Binomial, or Poisson sta-
tistical models, and the best model was then applied to the corresponding subset of transcripts
depending on the transcript expression within each subset. Differentially expressed transcripts
were identified using a P value threshold of 0.05 adjusted for genome-wide statistical signifi-
cance using Storey’s q-value algorithm [73]. Differential expression was calculated as fold
change (FC, lens-treated eye versus control). To identify sets of genes with coordinate expres-
sion, differentially expressed transcripts were clustered using Partek Flow hierarchical cluster-
ing module using average linkage for the cluster distance metric and Euclidean distance metric
to determine the distance between data points. Each RNA-seq sample corresponding to one
control or one lens-treated eye was analyzed as a biological replicate, thus resulting in three
biological replicates for control eyes and three biological replicates for lens-treated eyes in each
of the four experimental groups.
GO analysis and identification of sign-of-defocus–specific signaling pathways
To identify biological functions (GO categories), which are significantly affected by the
changes in gene expression induced by the optical defocus in the retina, we used QIAGEN’s
Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) software and database (QIAGEN, Germantown, MD). IPA
Downstream Effects Analysis module was used to visualize biological trends and predict the
effect of gene expression changes in the datasets on biological processes. Downstream Effects
Analysis is based on expected causal effects between genes and functions; the expected causal
effects are derived from the literature compiled in the Ingenuity Knowledge Base. The analysis
examines genes in the dataset that are known to affect functions, compares the genes’ direction
of change to expectations derived from the literature, and then issues a prediction for each
function based on the direction of change. The direction of change was determined as the dif-
ference in gene expression in the retina exposed to +5D or −5D lenses relative to the contralat-
eral control retina exposed to the plano lens. We used the Fisher’s exact test with a P value
threshold of 0.05 to estimate statistical significance and the z-score algorithm to make predic-
tions about direction of change. The z-score algorithm is designed to reduce the chance that
random data will generate significant predictions. The activation z-score was used to infer
likely activation states of biological functions based on comparison with a model that assigns
random regulation directions. The z-score provided an estimate of statistical quantity of
change for each biological function found to be statistically significantly affected by the
changes in gene expression. The activation z-score can also predict implicated biological func-
tions independently from their associated P value, based on significant pattern match of up- or
down-regulation. The activation z-score was also employed in the IPA Pathways Activity Anal-
ysis module to predict activation or suppression of the canonical pathways affected by optical
defocus. The significance values for the canonical pathways were calculated by the right-tailed
Fisher’s exact test. The significance indicates the probability of association of molecules from
each dataset with the canonical pathway by random chance alone. Pathways Activity Analysis
determined if canonical pathways, including functional end points, are activated or suppressed
based on differentially expressed genes or proteins in each dataset. Once statistically significant
biological functions and canonical pathways for −5D/10 days, −5D/5 weeks, +5D/10 days, and

 +5D/5 weeks datasets were identified, we subjected these datasets to the Core Functional Anal-
ysis in IPA to compare the datasets and identify key similarities and differences in the biologi-
cal functions and canonical pathways affected in each experimental group.
Identification of candidate genes for human myopia
To identify candidate genes for human myopia, we compared the genes differentially
expressed in the marmoset retina in response to imposed defocus with a list of genes located
within QTLs found to be associated with myopia in a human population. We first compiled a
list of all SNPs or markers exhibiting statistically significant association with myopia in the
human linkage or GWAS studies. LDlink’s LDmatrix tool (National Cancer Institute) was
used to identify SNPs in linkage disequilibrium and identify overlapping chromosomal loci.
We then used UCSC Table Browser to extract all genes located within critical chromosomal
regions identified by the human linkage studies or within 200 kb (±200 kb) of the SNPs found
by GWAS. The list of genes located within human QTLs was compared with the list of genes
that we found to be differentially expressed in the marmosets exposed to optical defocus using
Partek Genomics Suite. The statistical significance of the overlaps was estimated using proba-
bilities associated with the hypergeometric distribution, using Bioconductor software package
GeneOverlap and associated functions.
