Aims
Studies suggest that people who work long hours are at increased risk of stroke, but the association of long work-
ing hours with atrial fibrillation, the most common cardiac arrhythmia and a risk factor for stroke, is unknown. We
examined the risk of atrial fibrillation in individuals working long hours (>
_55 per week) and those working standard
35–40 h/week.

atrial fibrillation was 10years and cases were defined using data on electrocardiograms, hospital records, drug reim-
bursement registers, and death certificates. We identified 1061 new cases of atrial fibrillation (10-year cumulative
incidence 12.4 per 1000). After adjustment for age, sex and socioeconomic status, individuals working long hours had
a 1.4-fold increased risk of atrial fibrillation compared with those working standard hours (hazard ratio = 1.42, 95%
CI= 1.13–1.80, P = 0.003). There was no significant heterogeneity between the cohort-specific effect estimates
(I2 = 0%, P = 0.66) and the finding remained after excluding participants with coronary heart disease or stroke at base-
line or during the follow-up (N = 2006, hazard ratio = 1.36, 95% CI = 1.05–1.76, P = 0.0180). Adjustment for potential
confounding factors, such as obesity, risky alcohol use and high blood pressure, had little impact on this association.

Conclusion
Individuals who worked long hours were more likely to develop atrial fibrillation than those working standard hours.

Background
Atrial fibrillation is the most common cardiac arrhythmia and contrib-
utes to the development of several adverse health outcomes, such as
stroke, heart failure, and multi-infarct dementia.1–3 Cardiovascular
and respiratory disease, hypertension and left ventricular hypertro-
phy are risk factors for atrial fibrillation.2,4,5 Additionally, findings from
observational studies have been used to suggest that maintaining a
lifestyle that reduces the risk of cardiovascular disease—avoidance of
obesity, smoking and heavy alcohol consumption—may also have a
positive impact on rates of atrial fibrillation.6–8
Although the 2016 European Guidelines for cardiovascular disease
prevention acknowledges psychosocial stress at work as a potential
risk factor for cardiovascular disease,9 citing evidence that show long
working hours to be associated with increased stroke risk,10 little is
known about the role of long working hours as a potential risk factor
of atrial fibrillation. In principle, stress and long working hours may
enhance functional re-entry, repetitive pulmonary vein and atrial
firing,11,12 and autonomic nervous system abnormalities,13 inducing
arrhythmia vulnerability.14 Thus, some studies have found that stress
and ‘exhaustion’ predict symptomatic atrial fibrillation.15,16 However,
this evidence is uncertain because it is based on small study samples.
Accordingly, we conducted a large-scale study on long working
hours and incident atrial fibrillation in the general population
using data from cohort studies participating in the Individual-
Participant-Data Meta-analysis in Working Populations (IPD-Work)
Consortium.10,17,18
Methods
Participants
In ten cohort studies of the IPD-Work Consortium, data on working
hours and atrial fibrillation were available, although in two studies (the
Intervention Project on Absence and Well-being and the Work, Lipids
and Fibrinogen study Norrland) the low number of participants with long
working hours (n = 6 and 55, respectively) and atrial fibrillation during the
follow-up (n = 0 among participants working long hours in both studies)
precluded inclusion of these studies in the analysis. The remaining eight
studies were included in the analyses: the Copenhagen Psychosocial
Questionnaire Study (COPSOQ) I and COPSOQ-II, the Danish Work
Environment Cohort Study (DWECS), the Finnish Public Sector Study
(FPS), the Health and Social Support study (HeSSup), the PUMA study,
the Whitehall II study, and the Work, Lipids and Fibrinogen study
(WOLF), Stockholm (see Supplementary material online, Appendix S1).
Most of these were multi-purpose studies designed to examine health
effects across a range of risk factors, including those related to workplace.
The analytic sample comprised 85494 participants (29 579 men and
55915 women) from the UK, Denmark, Sweden, and Finland who were
free of atrial fibrillation at baseline (1991–2004). All studies were
approved by the relevant local or national ethics committee and all partic-
ipants gave informed consent to participate.
Assessment of working hours and
covariates at baseline
Working hours were assessed at baseline which was between 1991 and
2004 depending on the cohort study. As in previous studies, we classified
working hours into categories of ‘less than 35h’, ‘35–40h’, ‘41–48h’, ‘49–
54h’, and ‘>
_55h/week’.10,17,18 The first category includes part-time work-
ers and the second category is the reference group of full-time workers
with standard working hours. The category of 41–48h/week includes
those working more than standard hours but still in accordance with the
European Union Working Time Directive (2003/88/EC), which guarantees
employees the right to limit weekly working time at 48 h on average. The
remaining two categories include working times beyond this threshold,
with the top category of 55 or more hours per week being the most com-
monly used definition for long working hours in medical research.10,17–20
Pre-defined, harmonized covariates included potential confounders,
such as age, sex, and socioeconomic status (SES; high, intermediate, low,
unknown), and potential mediators, such as smoking (current, ex, never
smoker), body mass index (BMI, calculated as weight (in kilograms)/height
(in meters) squared and categorized according to the WHO classifica-
tion: <18.5, 18.5–24.9, 25.0–29.9, 30.0–34.9, >
_35kg/m2), physical activity
(sedentary, moderately active, highly active), and alcohol consumption
(non-use; moderate, women: 1–14 drinks/week, men: 1–21 drinks/week;
intermediate, women: 15–20 drinks/week; men: 22–27 drinks/week; risky:
women: 21 or more drinks/week, men: 28 or more drinks/week).
As ascertainment of atrial fibrillation in the Whitehall II study was by
electrocardiogram (ECG), the gold standard method, and the study
included the widest range of atrial fibrillation risk factors of all IPD-Work
studies, a further set of analyses were undertaken in those data only.
Additional non-cardiovascular and cardiovascular risk factors at baseline
deemed to act as potential confounders or mediators of the long working
hours-atrial fibrillation relationship included:5,21 Prevalent infection/high sys-
temic inflammation defined using serum C-reactive protein (high-sensitivity

values>10mg/L); self-reported respiratory illness and doctor-diagnosed
heart trouble (including valve disease and congestive heart failure); left ven-
tricular hypertrophy (Minnesota codes 3-1, 3-3, 3-4); diabetes mellitus
(defined as fasting glucose >7.0mmol/L or a 2-h post load glucose
>11.1mmol/L during a 75g oral glucose tolerance test, or self-reported
doctor-diagnosed diabetes); depressive and anxiety symptoms using
the General Health Questionnaire caseness;22 systolic blood pressure (the
average of two readings taken in the sitting position after 5min of rest with
the Hawksley random-0 sphygmomanometer); use of antihypertensive
medication; total and high-density-lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol concen-
trations (measured by automated enzymatic colorimetric methods).
To examine whether cardiovascular disease preceded or followed
atrial fibrillation, we assessed coronary heart disease and stroke events at
baseline and follow-up. Coronary heart disease was denoted by diagnos-
tic codes I21–I22 in ICD-10, 410 in ICD-9 (in hospitalization data) or
using the MONICA criteria (Whitehall II study clinical examination).23
Coronary death included diagnostic codes I20–I25 in ICD-10, 410–414 in
ICD-9. Stroke included diagnostic codes I60, I61, I63, I64 in ICD-10 and
430, 431, 433, 434, 436 in ICD-9.
Outcome ascertainment
In WOLF, HeSSup, PUMA, FPS, DWECS, COPSOQ-I, and COPSOQ-II,
cases of atrial fibrillation at baseline and follow-up were identified using
electronic patient records of hospitalizations and deaths [International
Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD)
diagnostic codes I48 (ICD-10), 427.3 (ICD-9) or 427.4 (ICD-8)]. In FPS
and HeSSup, atrial fibrillation cases were additionally identified from the
nationwide drug reimbursement register for the treatment of this condi-
tion. In that register, entitlement to reimbursement is based on a detailed
medical examination and predefined criteria for the diagnosis. In the
Whitehall II study, atrial fibrillation was assessed using resting ECGs
(Minnesota code 83x) at baseline in 1991 and at follow-up examinations
in 1997, 2003, and 2008. In each study, participants with any indication of
pre-existing atrial fibrillation in electronic health records or ECG at base-
line were excluded (n = 250).
Statistical analysis
We analysed anonymized or pseudonymized individual-level data from
each cohort. We studied the associations between long working hours
and baseline covariates using logistic regression for dichotomous covari-
ates (obesity, physical inactivity, current smoking, risky alcohol use, infec-
tion/high systemic inflammation, respiratory disease, heart trouble, left
ventricular hypertrophy, diabetes, depressive and anxiety symptoms, anti-
hypertensive medication) and analysis of variance for continuous covari-
ates (systolic blood pressure, total, and HDL cholesterol) with adjustment
for age (continuous variable), sex and SES (categorical variables). To exam-
ine the extent to which incident atrial fibrillation was due to pre-existing
cardiovascular disease, we computed the proportion of incident atrial
fibrillation cases who had a record of cardiovascular disease (coronary
heart disease or stroke) before atrial fibrillation was first recorded.
After confirming that the proportional hazards assumptions were not
violated, we used Cox proportional hazards models to generate hazard
ratios and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for long working hours (55 h or
more per week) compared with standard (35–40) working hours (refer-
ence) in predicting incident atrial fibrillation in participants free of this
arrhythmia at baseline. In the basic statistical model, effect estimates were
adjusted for age (continuous variable), sex, and SES (categorical variable)
at baseline. Adjustment for SES is important because long working hours
were more common in participants with high SES (6.9% worked long
hours) relative to those in low SES group (4.6%). To examine whether
the association between long working hours and atrial fibrillation was
mediated by poor lifestyle factors, adjustments were made for smoking
(never, ex-, current smoker), alcohol consumption (non-use, moderate,
risky), BMI (categorical), and physical activity (inactive, moderately active,
highly active) at baseline. In analyses carried out in the Whitehall II study,
additional adjustments were made for doctor-diagnosed heart abnormal-
ities, infection/high systemic inflammation, respiratory disease, heart
problems, left ventricular hypertrophy, diabetes mellitus, depressive and
anxiety symptoms, use of antihypertensive medication (all dichotomous
variables), systolic blood pressure and total and HDL-cholesterol (contin-
uous variables), all measured at baseline.
Meta-analysis, based on random-effects modelling, was used to
combine results from each cohort. We examined heterogeneity of the
cohort-specific estimates using the I2 statistic (a higher value indicating
a greater degree of heterogeneity). In sensitivity analyses, we examined
the association separately in men and women, by age group (<50 vs.
>50 years at baseline) and by socioeconomic status (high, intermedi-
ate, low). We also stratified the analysis by the method of case ascer-
tainment to examine whether the association between long working
hours and atrial fibrillation was attenuated when the ascertainment
was based on electronic health records from registers of hospital
admissions, deaths and drug reimbursement as compared with ECG
assessment.
The statistical software SAS (version 9.4) was used to analyse study-
specific data and Stata (MP version 13.1) was used to compute the meta-
analyses.
Results
Of the 85494 participants, 35% were men and the mean age was
43.4 years (range 17–70) at baseline (Table 1). During the mean
follow-up of 10.0years, 1061 participants were diagnosed with atrial
fibrillation (10-year cumulative incidence 12.4 per 1000). In 71.4% of
cases, atrial fibrillation was diagnosed before the age of 65 (see

Supplementary material online, Appendix S2). This is as expected
given the young mean age and length of follow-up. Of the incident
atrial fibrillation cases, 86.7% had no cardiovascular disease during
the study period whereas 10.2% of incident cases of atrial fibrillation
had pre-existing cardiovascular disease when atrial fibrillation was
first recorded (see Supplementary material online, Appendix S3).
A total of 4484 (5.2%) participants worked >
_55 h/week and
53468 (62.5%) worked standard 35–40 hours at baseline. Long
working hours were associated with a slightly poorer lifestyle profile
at baseline characterized by a higher prevalence of obesity, leisure-
time physical inactivity, smoking and risky alcohol use (Table 2,
Supplementary material online, Appendix S4). Analysis of further base-
line covariates in the Whitehall II study show that participants work-
ing long hours were more likely to have depressive and anxiety
symptoms and less likely to have left ventricular hypertrophy than
those working standard hours.
In age, sex and SES-adjusted analyses, participants working long
hours were at increased risk of incident atrial fibrillation: the hazard
ratio compared with those working standard hours is 1.42 (95%
CI 1.13–1.80, P= 0.0031) (Figure 1). There was little heterogeneity in
the cohort-specific estimates: I2 = 0%, P= 0.66. Additional adjustment
for lifestyle factors marginally attenuated the association between long
vs. standard working hours and incident atrial fibrillation (1.41, 95%
CI 1.10–1.80, P= 0.0059, I2 = 0%, P= 0.62) (see Supplementary mate-
rial online, Appendix S5). The association between long working hours
and atrial fibrillation remained after adjustment for pre-existing coro-
nary heart disease at the time of atrial fibrillation diagnosis (1.41, 95%
CI
1.12–1.78,
P= 0.0039)
and
excluding
participants
with

1.11–1.79, P= 0.0054) or cardiovascular disease at baseline or follow-
up (N= 2006, hazard ratio= 1.36, 95% CI= 1.05–1.76, P= 0.0180).
As the Whitehall II study had available data on several other poten-
tial risk factors for atrial fibrillation, further adjustments were per-
formed using data from this cohort. The hazard ratio for long vs.
standard working hours as a predictor of incident atrial fibrillation
was 1.41 (95% CI 0.93–2.14, P = 0.1045, N = 6649, 224 incident cases
of atrial fibrillation) after adjustment for age, sex, and SES; this is close
to that observed in the total population (Figure 1). Additional adjust-
ment for lifestyle factors, infection/high systemic inflammation, respi-
ratory disease, doctor-diagnosed heart trouble (including valve
disease and congestive heart failure), left ventricular hypertrophy, dia-
betes mellitus, depressive and anxiety symptoms, systolic blood pres-
sure, antihypertensive medication, total and HDL-cholesterol had
little effect on this estimate (1.42, 95% CI 0.91–2.23, P = 0.12,
N = 5867, 195 incident cases of atrial fibrillation).
Figure 2 shows the shape of the association between all the catego-
ries of working hours and incident atrial fibrillation. There was a
dose-response gradient with hazard ratios of 1.02, 1.17, and 1.42 for
41–48, 49–54 and >
_55 working hours per week compared with
standard 35–40 working hours per week.

studies using records from hospital admissions, death and drug reim-
bursements, and 1.65, 95% CI 1.03–2.66, P = 0.038, for the five stud-
ies using records from hospital admissions and deaths only. In
stratified analyses, the association between long working hours and
atrial fibrillation did not differ between men and women (P = 0.267),
participants younger than 50 and those 50years or older at baseline
(P = 0.704) or by socioeconomic group (P = 0.186).
Discussion
It was found in this multi-cohort study of 85 494 men and women
that those working 55h or more a week had an approximately 40%
higher risk of atrial fibrillation compared with those working a stand-
ard 35–40-h week. Nine out of ten incident atrial fibrillation cases
occurred among those free of pre-existing or concurrent cardiovas-
cular disease, suggesting that the observed excess risk of atrial fibrilla-
tion is likely to reflect the effect of long working hours rather than
the effect of pre-existing or concurrent cardiovascular disease.
Multivariable adjusted analyses showed that the association was not
attributable to socioeconomic circumstances, lifestyles or common
risk factors for atrial fibrillation. In combination, these findings suggest
that long working hours is a risk factor for atrial fibrillation.
We are not aware of other studies on long working hours and
atrial fibrillation, although our investigation is in agreement with
small-scale studies linking other work-related stressors, such as job
strain, to this condition.24,25 The mechanisms underlying the associa-
tion between long working hours and atrial fibrillation are not known.
A recent systematic review of observational evidence from over 20
million men and women found that obesity, smoking, hypertension,
and high systemic inflammation were associated with an increased
risk of atrial fibrillation, whereas evidence on cholesterol and physical
activity was inconsistent.21 Other studies have also suggested that
high alcohol consumption and obesity-related conditions, such as
sleep apnea, may have a role in the aetiology of atrial fibrillation.26,27
In the present study, the prevalence of obesity, smoking, physical
inactivity and high alcohol consumption was higher in individuals
working long hours than in the standard working hours group, but
the difference was small (<3 percentage points). Similarly, there
appeared to be no difference in systemic inflammation, systolic blood
pressure or cholesterol. As such, classic risk factors for atrial fibrilla-
tion are unlikely to mediate the association between long working
hours and atrial fibrillation. In contrast, there has been the suggestion
of a link between extensive overtime working and autonomic nerv-
ous system abnormalities,13 a risk factor for atrial fibrillation.14,28,29
As such, stress-related mechanisms that may trigger arrhythmia, such
as autonomic dysfunction, might be a more promising focus for future
studies on long working hours and atrial fibrillation than mediation via
classic cardiovascular disease risk factors.
In absolute terms, the increased risk of atrial fibrillation among indi-
viduals with long working hours is relatively modest. The number of
cases varied between 13 and 449 in the included studies; none of the
study-specific associations between long working hours and atrial

fibrillation reached statistical significance at conventional levels. In
contrast, the association was highly significant in our pooled sample
including a total of 1061 incident atrial fibrillation cases. The method
of atrial fibrillation ascertainment was not uniform across studies—in
only one study were participants repeatedly assessed using an elec-
trocardiogram, the gold standard method, while in two other studies
cases were identified via records from hospital admissions, death cer-
tificates or drug reimbursements, and in five studies only records
from hospital admissions and deaths were available. The occurrence
of atrial fibrillation is likely to be underestimated in the seven record
linkage studies as they may miss undiagnosed and mildly symptomatic
cases. While the study using an electrocardiogram is stronger meth-
odologically, atrial fibrillation can be episodic and these “paroxysmal”
cases are difficult to identify even with an electrocardiogram.
Importantly, however, the relative risk of atrial fibrillation among indi-
viduals with long working hours was similar across the studies irre-
spective of the method of ascertainment: 1.4 in the study with ECG
ascertainment, 1.3 in studies using hospital, prescription and death
records, and 1.4 in those with hospital and death records only. This
suggests that misclassification was random in terms of participants’
working hours and has therefore not caused a significant bias.
While novel and large in scale, our study has several limitations.
First, as described, heterogeneous assessment of atrial fibrillation is a
drawback. Second, working hours and lifestyle factors were only
assessed at study induction. As working hours vary over time, our
findings may under- or overestimate the true effect due to imprecise
measurement of long-term exposure. Similarly, a lack of repeat meas-
urement of lifestyle factors prevented us from examining potential
behavioural mediators in the association between long working
hours and atrial fibrillation. Third, the overall study population
(N = 85494) included more women (65%) than men (35%). This was
because the largest cohort—the Finnish Public Sector study
(N = 44505)—is 81% female reflecting the sex distribution of public
sector workers in Finland at the time of study enrolment. That there
was no significant sex difference in the association between working
hours and atrial fibrillation suggests our sex-adjusted analyses of men
and women combined provide an accurate estimation of the associa-
tion. Fourth, it is noteworthy that despite differences between the
studies in terms of year of recruitment (range from 1991 to 2004),

more per week had a 1.4-fold increased risk of AF compared to
those working standard 35–40 weekly hours (A). This estimate did
not vary according to the method of AF ascertainment (B).

study population, location, methodology and settings, there was no
significant heterogeneity in study-specific estimates of the association
between long working hours and risk of atrial fibrillation. This sup-
ports the robustness of the main finding.
Conclusion
Our findings raise the hypothesis that long working hours may affect
the risk of atrial fibrillation (Summarizing Figure). We showed that
employees working long hours were 40% more likely to develop this
cardiac arrhythmia than those working standard hours. As this associ-
ation appeared to be independent of known risk factors for atrial
fibrillation, further research is needed to determine mechanisms
underlying the link between long working hours and atrial fibrillation.
Furthermore, the participants of this study were from the UK,
Denmark, Sweden, and Finland. Although there is no reason to
assume that the association would be dependent on geographical
region, the generalizability of our findings to other countries remains
to be confirmed.

This is to the best of our knowledge the first re-
port of cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
in a patient with a leadless cardiac pacemaker
(LCP). Imaging was performed to rule out myocar-
ditis in a 77-year-old male patient who had under-
gone LCP implantation (MicraTM, Medtronic) for
atrial fibrillation with bradycardia 20 months be-
fore (Panel A). After a precise check of the func-
tional parameters, the device was programmed to
the MRI mode (V00 with a fixed rate of 80 b.p.m.).
The MRI was performed in a long bore 3.0
Tesla
magnet
(MagnetomV
RSkyra,
Siemens,
Erlangen, Germany) with a maximal specific ab-
sorption rate of 1.5 W/kg. During MRI, the patient
was monitored continuously by electrocardio-
gram and pulse oximetry. The cardiac MRI showed
metallic artefacts at the apex of the heart due to
the implanted LCP in the apex of the right ven-
tricle and at the sternum due to sternal wires after
cardiac surgery. The LCP caused an ‘arc-shaped’
artefact (in the cine images because of local field
distortion leading to de-phasing of the transverse
magnetization). However, these artefacts impaired
the diagnostic quality of the cardiac MR images
only in a small region of the apex (Panels B, C,
and D).
During and after the scan, no device related adverse events occurred. The LCP’s functional parameters were stable (pacing threshold
0.5 V and 0.38 V, impedance 550 X and 580 X, sensing 20 mV and 20 mV before and immediately after the scan, respectively).
