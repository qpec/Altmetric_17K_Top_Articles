Study Objectives: To investigate sleep’s effect in the immediate aftermath of experiencing an analog trauma in the laboratory on reducing intrusive 
emotional memory formation.
Methods: Sixty-five healthy women were exposed to an experimental laboratory trauma. They viewed a neutral and a trauma film in the laboratory and were 
randomly allocated to either a group that slept following film viewing or a group that remained awake. Sleep was recorded with electroencephalogram in a 
subgroup of participants in the sleep group. All participants recorded intrusive memories in the week following the film.
Results: The sleep group experienced fewer and less distressing intrusive trauma memories compared to the wake group. These effects were particularly 
evident toward the end of the week. Duration spent in stage N2 as opposed to light N1 sleep, a higher number of fast parietal sleep spindles and a lower rapid 
eye movement sleep density predicted intrusion frequency.
Conclusions: Our results have clinical implications and set the ground for early-intervention sleep studies following trauma and prevention of chronic 
posttrauma disorders.

INTRODUCTION
Sleep’s role in the context of experiencing trauma has been a 
topic of debate that is of central importance to understanding 
the development of intrusive emotional memories post-
trauma.1 Reexperiencing such spontaneous and emotion-laden 
trauma memories is a core feature of posttraumatic stress dis-
order (PTSD), one of the most frequent psychiatric problems 
following trauma. Such intrusions comprise mostly sensory 
impressions and emotional responses from the trauma, and are 
fragmented and disconnected from contextual information,2 
possibly lacking proper integration into hippocampal-cortical 
memory networks due to extreme arousal at encoding.3 Over 
the past decade, successful psychotherapy interventions have 
been developed that aim to change or weaken the intrusiveness 
of trauma memories and enhance integration of the trauma 
memory into survivors’ existing network of autobiographical 
memories. This can be achieved, for example, by imaginal 
and in vivo exposure and by incorporating updated informa-
tion into the memory.4,5 Although early pharmacological in-
terventions to depotentiate traumatic memories are currently 
the subject of active research,6 integrative memory processes 
occurring during sleep might have a high potential for trauma 
memory modulation in the early aftermath of trauma. There 
are currently two contrasting views regarding sleep’s role 
on trauma memory formation and the development of PTSD. 
On the one hand, it has been proposed that, via offline con-
solidation processes, sleep may selectively enhance emotional 
trauma memories and thus exacerbate intrusive memories and 
PTSD symptoms.7,8 On the other hand, sleep may contribute 
to memory integration and affective depotentiation, hence 
leading to fewer intrusive trauma memories and decreased 
PTSD symptoms.9

Significance
Sleep post analogue trauma was associated with fewer and less distressing intrusive trauma memories. Sleep characteristics, such as N2 sleep 
and sleep spindles were associated with intrusive memory frequency. Sleep early after trauma may be protective and play an important role in early 
intervention in facilitating adaptation to trauma.
It is now well established that sleep is involved in the con-
solidation of memories, including emotional memories.9,10 
During nonrapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, recently en-
coded memories are spontaneously reactivated and gradually 
integrated into cortical networks of preexisting long-term 
memories in a process of active system consolidation.11 The 
integration of memories during sleep probably relies on an in-
terleaved hippocampal reactivation of new and associated old 
memories and occurs in a fine-tuned interaction with cortical 
slow oscillations (< 1 Hz) and thalamocortical fast-spindle ac-
tivity (13–15 Hz).12
Remarkably, several studies suggest that emotional memo-
ries are preferentially reactivated and consolidated during 
sleep,12–14 leading some authors to suggest that sleep depriva-
tion and sleep disturbances shortly after trauma might have a 
protective effect. It is argued that sleep deprivation may hamper 
memory strengthening that may otherwise occur during 
sleep.13 In a recent experimental study,8 sleep deprivation after 
watching a trauma film indeed reduced intrusive memories on 
the initial 2 days postfilm. Based on these findings, the authors 
suggested that sleep deprivation may prevent sleep-dependent 
memory enhancement by disrupting trauma memory consoli-
dation. However, the effect of sleep was only seen on the first 
2 days and was no longer present throughout the remaining 
study period. That is, no negative effects of sleep were found 
on affective distress of intrusive memories. Over time, the ef-
fect of sleep appeared to reverse in that on days 5–6, the sleep 
group experienced fewer intrusive memories, although this ef-
fect was not significant. A closer look at how the effect of sleep 
on intrusive memories unfolds over time thus seems warranted.
In contrast with the notion that sleep deprivation following 
trauma is beneficial, disturbed sleep has been shown to

contribute to PTSD symptoms and is regarded as a risk factor 
for PTSD development.15–17 In line with these findings, sleep 
after emotional learning has been shown to depotentiate af-
fective tone of emotional memories, in spite of strengthening 
their content.18 Given the assumption that memory integration 
promotes voluntary retrieval while simultaneously inhibiting 
involuntary retrieval of trauma memories, the beneficial role of 
NREM sleep on memory integration should prevent the forma-
tion of intrusive traumatic memories, which has not yet been 
directly examined.
Here we investigate the effect of sleep after exposure to a 
traumatic event on formation of intrusive memories in a lab-
oratory study in healthy young females. Based on the afore-
mentioned studies, it was hypothesized that sleep’s effect was 
protective.9,12–14,19 We also sought to relate sleep stages and can-
didate indices of sleep assessed via electroencephalography 
(EEG) (stage 1 and 2 sleep, slow wave sleep, rapid eye move-
ment [REM] sleep, REM density, sleep spindle density) to later 
intrusive memories.
METHODS
Subjects
Participants were 71 healthy young females, with a mean age 
of 24 y, standard deviation (SD) = 3.13. Recruitment was re-
stricted to female subjects as the type of trauma (interpersonal 
violence with a female survivor, for example) is likely to exert 
differential effects on male and females that would be diffi-
cult to control in a mixed sample. Participants were screened 
to ensure that they or any close relatives or friends had not 
been exposed to any interpersonal trauma. We also excluded 
those who reported any psychiatric problems, such as anxiety 
or depression. These exclusion criteria were assessed over the 
phone via questions derived from standardized questionnaires, 
such as the Beck Depression Inventory and Beck Anxiety In-
ventory. Of 84 subjects recruited via newspaper ads, 10 did not 
meet these exclusion criteria and were excluded, and 3 chose 
not to participate or did not attend the laboratory session. Six 
participants had to be excluded: four participants did not fill in 
the intrusion diary, one participant in the sleep group did not 
sleep, and one participant experienced the neutral film as trau-
matizing due to a prior personal life event that had remained 
undisclosed during initial screening. Data from 65 subjects 
were included in the analyses, 32 in the sleep and 33 in the 
wake condition. Subjects received 50 Swiss francs (approxi-
mately US $55) as compensation for their participation.
Procedure
The local ethics review board at the University of Zurich ap-
proved the study. Participation included three appointments: 
an initial screening session to assess eligibility over the phone, 
the laboratory session during which participants filled in ques-
tionnaires and viewed the films, and an assessment at the labo-
ratory 7 days later to return the intrusion diary, discuss entries, 
and fill in some more questionnaires, see Figure 1. After com-
plete description of the study to participants, written informed 
consent was obtained. Participants then completed a brief 
screening in order to assess whether they fulfilled diagnostic 
criteria for depression or anxiety disorder. Laboratory sessions 
took place in a temperature-controlled, sound-attenuated, and 
darkened room at the university. Participants were randomly 
assigned to the sleep or wake groups. The sleep group slept at 
home after film viewing. In a subgroup of participants (n = 18), 
sleep was additionally polysomnographically recorded using 
a mobile recording device (see following paragraphs). Par-
ticipants in the wake group viewed the movies either in the 
morning, i.e., in the hours between 09:00 and 11:00 and stayed 
awake for at least 8 h afterward (daytime wake) or in the eve-
ning and were sleep deprived during the night. Participants 
in the sleep group viewed the movies in the evening, i.e., in 
the hours between 18:00 and 21:00, and slept following film 
viewing. Because the results were highly comparable between 
these two conditions, data were collapsed across the day-wake 
and sleep deprivation conditions.
Trauma and Neutral Films
The trauma film consisted of a 12-min scene from the film “Ir-
reversible”, directed by Gaspar Noe. It comprised a fictional 
scene depicting physical and sexual violence and was played on 
a 19-inch monitor in a darkened laboratory room. Participants 
viewed both films individually, without presence of the experi-
menter in the room. They were asked to pay full attention to 
the film without diverting attention away and were later asked 
to rate gaze aversion during film viewing. Participants were 
informed on the study advertisement, telephone screening, and 
informed consent process that the video contained graphic ma-
terial that some individuals may find disturbing and that they 
were free to withdraw from the study at any time without pen-
alty. The neutral film was a film of equal length containing a 
scene from a National Geographic compilation of blue whales. 
Participants each viewed a trauma as well as a neutral film, in 
randomized order.
Following film viewing, participants were asked to rate 
themselves, using the widely used measure of self-reported 
fear, the Subjective Units of Distress Scale (SUDS)20 as to how 
distressed they felt. The SUDS was a 100-point scale on which 
participants rated their level of distress. In addition, partici-
pants filled in questionnaires and were introduced to their per-
sonal intrusion diary.
One-Week Intrusion Diary
Participants kept a pen-and-paper intrusion diary over 7 days 
following the laboratory session. The diary was prepared and 
explained to them and they were asked to briefly describe in 
writing each intrusive memory relating to the film at the time of 
occurrence (or as soon as possible). They were educated about 
intrusive memories and asked to note each intrusive memory, 
including content, vividness, distress, and intrusiveness char-
acteristics for each memory they experienced during this time. 
They also recorded memory characteristics, i.e., vividness and 
distress for each of the memories, on a scale of 0 to 100 (not at 
all vivid/distressing to extremely vivid/distressing).
Follow-up Assessment
Patients returned to the laboratory 1 w later to discuss their 
diary and complete some additional questionnaires.

Sleep Recordings
Sleep was recorded using a portable EEG machine (SOMNO-
screen EEG 10/20, SOMNOmedics, Randersacker, Germany), 
which participants took to their home. Sleep was recorded 
in participants’ natural environment on two occasions (one 
initial recording was conducted in order to get participants 
accustomed to the EEG equipment in the night prior to the 
laboratory session) on Fz, Cz, Pz, and Oz channels according 
to the international 10/20 system. The left mastoid was used 
as reference. In addition, electrooculography, chin electromy-
ography, and electrocardiography were recorded. Sleep pa-
rameters and architecture were determined using a validated 
automatic scoring algorithm21 according to standard criteria of 
the American Academy of Sleep Medicine.22 All polysomno-
graphic recordings were additionally checked by a sleep expert 
to ensure scoring accuracy and corrected when necessary. In 
addition, all recordings were examined individually to assess 
the occurrence of sleep.
Spindle Analysis
Slow (< 13 Hz) and fast spindles (> 13 Hz) were separately 
identified at the three selected EEG recording sites (Fz, Cz, 
Pz) during NREM sleep stage 2, based on an algorithm ad-
opted from previous studies.23 In brief, frequency power 
was extracted in the frequency bands of interest (10–13 Hz; 
13–15 Hz), and the events were counted for which the power 
signal exceeded a fixed threshold (± 10 muV) for an interval 
lasting 0.5–3 sec. Spindles were counted separately in each 
channel during EEG segments free of movement artifacts 
(maximal electromyography difference < 150 muV). To calcu-
late mean spindle density, mean spindle counts were divided 
by the number of analyzed 30-sec epochs. The two separate 
spindle bands were chosen based on previous studies that dem-
onstrated the presence of two types of spindles in humans pos-
sibly linked to different aspects of cognitive function, i.e., slow 
spindles that prevail over the frontal cortex and show greater 
topographical variability than the fast spindles concentrated 
over the parietal cortex.24
REM Analysis
Average REM density was calculated by dividing the number 
of 1-sec periods during REM sleep that contained REMs by the 
total number of 1-sec REM sleep epochs.25 REMs during REM 
sleep were detected automatically and were defined as rapid 
signal changes in the electrooculography channel (> 0.8 mV/s) 
after movement artefact rejection and application of a 50-msec 
moving average. Automatic detection was restricted to REM 
sleep episodes without artefacts.
Figure 1—Effects of sleep on intrusive memory frequency. Following exposure to a trauma movie and a neutral movie, participants either slept or remained 
awake and then recorded intrusive memories of either movie during the following 6 days in an intrusion diary (a). Participants who slept report fewer 
intrusive trauma, but not neutral memories compared to those who remained awake (b). Moreover, intrusive trauma memories were less distressing in those 
who slept compared to those who remained awake, whereas no differences were found for neutral memories (c).

Questionnaire Measures
The following self-report questionnaires were administered: 
chronotype was assessed with the Morningness-Eveningness-
Questionnaire,26 excessive daytime sleepiness was assessed 
using the Epworth Sleepiness Scale,27 and sleep quality was 
assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index.28 Depres-
sive symptoms were assessed with the Beck Depression In-
ventory,29 and anxiety symptoms were assessed with the Beck 
Anxiety Inventory.30 A number of other questionnaires were 
included in the study, assessing mood, affective state, and trait 
information processing, but these will be reported elsewhere.
Statistical Analysis
Statistical analyses were performed with PASW 21.0 for Ma-
cintosh. Group differences in demographic, clinical, and sleep-
related variables were analyzed with analyses of variance or 
chi-square tests. General linear models were calculated to as-
sess the effect of film type (trauma versus neutral) and group 
(sleep versus wake) on number and distress of intrusive memo-
ries recorded during days 2 to 7. For the statistical analyses, 
data were log-transformed to conform to a normal distribu-
tion. We excluded day 1, as these recordings would be mark-
edly different for those who slept right after the film and those 
who slept later or were sleep deprived, respectively. We also 
included study group as factor in this analyses, controlling for 
the two wake conditions (daytime wake vs. sleep deprivation) 
and the two sleep conditions (with vs. without polysomnog-
raphy). We investigated daily measures of intrusion frequency 
and affective distress and tested group differences for these 
indices for days 1 to 7, as we were interested in investigating 
how sleep’s effect may unfold over consecutive nights. In an 
explorative analysis, we correlated selected sleep indices with 
number and distress of intrusive memories. Effect sizes were 
calculated for significant results.
RESULTS
Descriptives
Sleep and wake groups did not differ in any of the demographic, 
sleep, or clinical variables; see Table 1.
Effects of Sleep on Intrusive Memories
As predicted, sleep early after viewing the trauma film had a 
protective effect on the development of intrusive memories. 
Participants who were awake after film viewing reported on 
average MWake = 5.91, SD = 3.46 intrusive memories in total, 
whereas participants who slept after the movie indicated only 
MSleep = 4.28, SD = 3.27 intrusive memories (For study group 1: 
MWake = 3.68, SD = 0.60 vs MWake = 5.10, SD = 0.58, for study 
group 2: MWake = 3.42, SD = 0.53, MWake = 4.36, SD = 0.53). 
This difference was significant (F(1,64) = 3.79, P = 0.019). 
The reported trauma film memories were similar to intrusive 
memories commonly seen in PTSD patients, i.e., contained 
mostly sensory memories, such as seeing the offender’s face 
or eyes staring, seeing how the victims is pressed to the floor, 
her screams, etc. We observed no difference between the 
sleep and wake group’s intrusive memories of the neutral con-
trol film (MSleep = 0.78, SD = 1.0, vs. MWake = 0.91, SD = 1.51, 
F(1,64) = 0.16, P = 0.690). A significant interaction between 
experimental group (“wake vs. sleep”) and film type (“trauma” 
vs. “neutral”) confirmed the specificity of the protective ef-
fect of sleep on the development of intrusive memories 
(F(1, 61) = 4.38, P = 0.041). Generally, significantly more intru-
sive trauma memories were reported compared to memories 
from the neutral film (MTrauma = 5.11, SD = 3.44, MNeutral = 0.85, 
SD = 1.28, t (64) = 9.58, P < 0.001). No significant interactions 
were observed with wake group type (i.e., daytime wake vs. 
sleep deprivation) and film type or sleep vs. wake groups (all 
values of P > 0.217).

Sleep Reduces Intrusive Emotional Memories—Kleim et al.
Sleep was not only protective in terms of frequency of 
reexperiencing, but also significantly reduced the affective 
tone or distress experienced in the context of intrusive mem-
ories. Those who slept after the film reported significantly 
less distressing trauma memories (MSleep = 9.98, SD = 8.03) 
as compared to those who remained awake (MWake = 14.83, 
SD = 10.02, F(1,64) = 4.61, P = 0.036). This difference was 
not significant for the neutral film (MSleep = 0.94, SD = 1.37, vs. 
MWake = 1.20, SD = 2.66, F(1,64) = < 1, P = 0.625). The inter-
action between these factors was significant (F(1, 61) = 6.84, 
P = 0.011). Generally, participants reported more distress in 
the context of trauma memories compared to memories from 
the neutral film (MTrauma = 12.44, SD = 9.35, MNeutral = 1.07, 
SD = 2.11, t (64) = 10.38, P < 0.001). Interactions between 
film type and study group, as well as between film type, 
sleep group and study group were not significant (all values 
of P > 0.107).
Chronotype, indexed by the Morningness-Eveningness-
Questionnaire (DMEQ) sumscore, was not significantly re-
lated to intrusion frequency, distress, or vividness, all P > 0.60.
Sleep Indices and Intrusive Memories
Participants in the subgroup of those whose sleep was recorded 
with EEG (n = 18) slept an average of 7 h, SD = 0.81, with a 
mean sleep latency of 16 min, SD = 15.85. On average, partici-
pants spent 28 min in sleep stage 1, 3.6 h, SD = 45.4 min, in 
sleep stage 2, with an average of 83 min of slow wave sleep, 
SD = 27.13 and 87 min of REM sleep, SD = 30.99 min. An 
exploratory analysis of the contribution of candidate sleep 
parameters to the development of intrusive reexperiencing 
showed that more stage 2 sleep and a higher density of parietal 
fast sleep spindles (13–15 Hz) was related to fewer trauma film 
intrusions (r = −0.56 and r = −0.48, both P < 0.05, see Figure 2). 
In contrast, increased time spent awake after sleep onset and in 
stage 1 sleep predicted a higher number of intrusions (r = +0.47 
and r = +0.51, respectively, both P ≤ 0.05, see Table 2). Simi-
larly, higher REM density was related to higher intrusion de-
velopment (r = +0.48, P = 0.042, see Figure 2). There were no 
significant correlations between percentage of slow wave sleep 
or REM sleep, or total sleep duration with intrusive reexperi-
encing, all P > 0.294, see Table 2).
DISCUSSION
Here we show that sleep may play a key role in memory inte-
gration following exposure to trauma. Our results indicate that 
sleep in the early aftermath of trauma exposure in the labo-
ratory, compared to staying awake, reduced the amount and 
emotional distress of subsequent intrusive trauma memories. 
This effect was specific to the trauma film memories, as no 
difference emerged for memories from the neutral film. The 
effect developed over time: the groups initially experienced 
similar number of intrusions, but intrusion count significantly 
declined in the sleep group for days 3, 6, and 7, see Figure 3. 
There were similar effects for affective distress of intrusive 
memories, which was also significantly reduced in the sleep 
group for days 3, 4, 6, and 7, as depicted in Figure 3. In addi-
tion, longer duration spent in NREM sleep stage N2, parietal 
fast sleep spindle density as well as decreased REM density 
emerged as critical physiological parameters during sleep that 
predicted a reduction in intrusive reexperiencing.
Exposure to trauma requires an integration of a distressing 
and emotionally charged experience into one’s autobiograph-
ical memory base. In trauma survivors afflicted with PTSD, the 
traumatic experience is predominantly laid down in memory 
in a disorganized and fragmented fashion that is not well inte-
grated into its context in time, place, subsequent and previous 
information, and other autobiographical memories.31 This lack 
of integration may underlie the intrusive and distressing na-
ture of traumatic memories, and may be due to an improper 
and nonadaptive overconsolidation of traumatic experiences. 
In contrast, during sleep, consolidation of memories is highly 
adaptive and fosters the proper integration of memories into its 
appropriate context. Particularly during NREM sleep, newly 
learned information is spontaneously reactivated in an inter-
leaved and selective fashion with related old memories in a so-
called “hippocampal-neocortical dialogue”, 32 benefiting the 
integration and reorganization of relevant new memories with 
respect to already existing experiences.33 The sleep-related 
reactivation and integration processes occur in a fine-tuned 
interaction with several oscillatory signals, including hip-
pocampal sharp-wave ripples, cortical slow oscillations, and 
parietal fast spindles.10 Thus, proper consolidation and inte-
gration of memories during sleep should hamper the develop-
ment of nonintegrated and intrusive traumatic memories. This 
notion is strengthened by the common observation that sleep 
disturbances, including insomnia and nightmares, are frequent 
in the aftermath of trauma and associated with PTSD symp-
toms.15,16,34,35 In line with this notion, our results provide the 
first direct evidence that sleep during this time window has a 
protective effect on the formation of intrusive trauma memo-
ries, as those who slept experienced fewer and less distressing 
intrusive trauma memories compared to those who remained 
awake and that the reduction was associated with the density 
of parietal sleep spindles. The effects of sleep on intrusive 
memory formation in our study were specific to the emotional 
trauma memories, and no effects emerged for intrusive memo-
ries of the neutral film. This is in line with previous studies

suggesting that emotional memories are tagged and preferen-
tially reactivated and consolidated during sleep.36
Our results are in line with studies and theoretical accounts 
proposing a role of sleep in the affective depotentiation of 
emotional memories.9,14,13,18,37 Recent functional magnetic reso-
nance imaging studies show that participants who slept after 
encoding emotionally aversive pictures showed reduced amyg-
dala activity when exposed to the same pictures later whereas 
no such depotentiation of amygdala activity was found in the 
group who remained awake.18 However, in our study we do 
not find evidence for a critical role of REM sleep in this pro-
cess. In contrast, REM density was inversely correlated with 
the reduction of intrusive memories, and a longer time spent 
in NREM stage 2 sleep and the density of fast parietal sleep 
spindles might be more beneficial in this regard. These find-
ings are in support of the notion that the reduction of intrusive 
memories is related to processes of reactivation and memory 
integration occurring mainly during NREM sleep.
Some previous studies showed strengthening of emotional 
memories after consolidation during sleep.13,18,35,38 On the basis 
of these results, it has been argued that sleep posttrauma might 
consolidate and further strengthen negative traumatic memo-
ries and that symptoms of sleep disturbance frequently seen 
in trauma survivors in whom PTSD later develops serve as an 
evolutionary useful mechanism against the formation of such 
memories.37 Kuriyama et al.37 investigated sleep in the context 
of fear generalization and found that sleep deprivation reduced 
fear-associated memories. Most of these studies indexed vol-
untary recognition memory, such as the study by Wagner et 
al.,13 which showed that sleep led to enhanced recall of pre-
viously encoded emotional narratives, or the study by Payne 
and Kensinger,38 which found enhanced recognition memory 
for emotional scenes following sleep, indexed by classification 
of whether individuals had previously seen an image or not. 
Emotional memory is perceptual, as emotion specifically pro-
motes perceptual memory, most likely by enhanced encoding 
of perceptual aspects of emotional experiences.39 Trauma 
memories are mostly manifest in involuntary intrusive memo-
ries, nightmares, or reliving and the current study captured 
this specific aspect of the memory. Here we investigated this 
involuntary, largely perceptual and key part of the emotional 
memory, rather than its voluntary and conceptual parts, as 
Figure 2—Associations between frequency of trauma film intrusions and sleep parameters. More stage 2 sleep (a) and a higher density of parietal fast 
sleep spindles (13–15 Hz) (b) were related to fewer trauma film intrusions. In contrast, increased time spent in stage 1 sleep (c) and increased rapid eye 
movement (REM) density (d) was related to more frequent intrusive reexperiencing.

Sleep Reduces Intrusive Emotional Memories—Kleim et al.
some of the previous studies did, and show a benefi
 cial effect 
of sleep on the involuntary, perceptual part of the memory in 
the form of decreased intrusive reexperiencing. In our view, 
strengthening and integration of trauma memories may hinder 
the development of intrusive involuntary traumatic memories.
Sleep strengthens the integration and later voluntary recall of 
emotional memories (in their proper context) due to an adap-
tive consolidation processes, thereby reducing the development 
of nonadaptive and nonintegrated intrusive trauma memories, 
which we indexed here.
Porcheret and colleagues investigated involuntary intrusive 
memories following sleep versus sleep deprivation in the con-
text of experimental trauma.8 Sleep deprivation had a protec-
tive role for intrusive memory formation, but this effect was 
specifi
 c to the fi
 rst day for the questionnaire measure and the 
fi
 rst 2 days for the diary measure. The protective effect was 
transient in that intrusion frequency did no longer differ be-
tween the groups for the later two segments of the week. The 
protective effect of sleep in our study was not found imme-
diately, i.e., 1–2 days following analog trauma exposure and 
sleep, and it is well possible that the opposite effect, i.e., an 
immediately protective effect of sleep deprivation, is present.1
In fact, affective distress of intrusive memories was higher 
(although this was not signifi
 cant) in the sleep group on day 
1. During the following segments of the week, however, the 
sleep group experienced signifi
 cantly fewer intrusions than the 
wake group, an effect that may well be present in the study 
by Porcheret et al., albeit nonsignifi
 cant. Evidence for distinct 
time-dependent sleep-related memory processes has recently 
been reported,40 suggesting a differentiation between initial 
hippocampus-dependent memory buffering effects and later 
consolidation intervals during delayed sleep over continuous 
nights. EEG measures and polysomnography were not included 
in the study by Porcheret et al. in either of the experimental 
groups, however, so that it remains unclear which aspects of 
sleep may have exerted an effect on intrusive memories in the 
group that slept. More studies are needed to gain insight into 
the neurobiological mechanisms of sleep-dependent learning 
to understand the precise processes that underlie the develop-
ment of intrusive memories.
The current study is not without limitations. First, we in-
cluded healthy female participants and thus cannot gener-
alize our results to male populations. Second, our study was 
conducted in the laboratory and future studies are needed to 
confi
 rm this effect in naturalistic studies, as the experimental, 
analog nature of the video stimuli differ in many ways from 
an actual traumatic memory. Third, although we asked par-
ticipants to refrain from using stimulants including coffee, 
energy drinks, etc., prior to taking part in the study, we did 
not index sleep or sleep hygiene prior to the experiment in a 
detailed way other than our assessment of general sleep using 
the standardized self-report measures mentioned previously. 
Additionally, sleep as well as memory encoding is likely to 
have been infl
 uenced by other variables, such as gonadal 
hormones as well as menstrual cycle phase, which we did 
not index in the current study. Fourth, we implemented sleep 
within the fi
 rst hours post- trauma in the laboratory, but the 
optimal timing of sleep during this initial posttrauma period 
still needs to be determined. Future studies must replicate 
and further investigate the association between specifi
 c sleep 
stages and indices of the sleep architecture, such as spindle 
and REM density, in the modulation of emotional trauma 
memories.
Our results suggest that sleep in the early aftermath of 
trauma may protect individuals from the development of intru-
sive memories, possibly by improved sleep-dependent consoli-
dation and integration of traumatic memories into neocortical 
long-term memory. Our results have clinical implications and 
set the stage for early intervention sleep studies following 
trauma and the prevention of PTSD. If replicated, our results 
suggest sleep as a viable intervention in the early aftermath of 
trauma that may help decrease the frequency intrusive memo-
ries, the affl
 icted emotional distress and thus reduce the burden 
of PTSD on individual survivors and society. Given the cur-
rent debate about early intervention for PTSD and the need to 
identify effective treatment strategies that can be applied in the 
early aftermath of trauma,5 the current fi
 ndings are timely and 
suggest sleep as a novel, non-pharmacological intervention for 
recent trauma survivors at risk for chronic PTSD.
Figure 3—Day-by-day profi
 le of intrusive memories depicting mean 
number of intrusive memories on days 1 to 7 (a), and mean distress of 
intrusive memories (range 0–10) (b), including standard errors of the 
mean (SEM). The sleep group experienced signifi
 cantly fewer intrusive 
memories (days 3, 6, and 7), but not during the fi
 rst 2-day period, 
indicating possible initiation of a process of memory reconsolidation that 
continues over several nights. Intrusive memories were also signifi
 cantly 
less affectively charged for days 3, 4, 6, and 7.
