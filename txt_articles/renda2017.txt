ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND Valvular heart disease (VHD) and atrial fibrillation (AF) often coexist. Phase III trials comparing
non–vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) with warfarin excluded patients with moderate/severe mitral
stenosis or mechanical heart valves, but variably included patients with other VHD and valve surgeries.
OBJECTIVES This study aimed to determine relative safety and efficacy of NOACs in patients with VHD.
METHODS We performed a meta-analysis of the 4 phase III AF trials of the currently available NOACs versus warfarin in
patients with coexisting VHD to assess pooled estimates of relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for
stroke/systemic embolic events (SSEE), major bleeding, intracranial hemorrhage (ICH), and all-cause death.
RESULTS Compared with warfarin, the rate of SSEE in patients treated with higher-dose NOACs was lower and
consistent among 13,585 patients with (RR: 0.70; 95% CI: 0.58 to 0.86) or 58,098 without VHD (RR: 0.84; 95% CI: 0.75
to 0.95; interaction p ¼ 0.13). Major bleeding in patients on higher-dose NOACs versus warfarin was similar and consistent
among patients with (RR: 0.93; 95% CI: 0.68 to 1.27) or without VHD (RR: 0.85; 95% CI: 0.70 to 1.02; interaction
p ¼ 0.63 for VHD/no-VHD difference). Intracranial hemorrhage was lower with higher-dose NOACs than with warfarin
irrespective of VHD (RR: 0.47; 95% CI: 0.24 to 0.93, and 0.49; 95% CI: 0.41 to 059, respectively; interaction p ¼ 0.91).
No protective effect of higher-dose NOACs in preventing all-cause death seemed to be present in patients with VHD
versus without VHD (RR:1.01; 95% CI: 0.90 to 1.14 vs. RR: 0.88; 95% CI: 0.82 to 0.94, respectively; interaction p ¼ 0.03).
CONCLUSIONS High-dose NOACs provide overall efficacy and safety similar in AF patients with or without VHD.

 to be at particularly high thromboembolic risk
(5)—have been consistently exclusion criteria
for the phase III trials comparing the non–
vitamin
K
antagonist
oral
anticoagulants
(NOACs) with warfarin (6–9). One phase II
trial testing the direct thrombin inhibitor
dabigatran etexilate in patients with mechan-
ical
prosthetic
valves
was
prematurely
terminated because of excess stroke in the
dabigatran arm at doses also associated with
excess bleeding (10). In these patients, there-
fore,
vitamin
K
antagonists
(VKAs)
are
currently the only recommended oral antico-
agulants for the prevention of SSEE (11–13),
whereas NOAC data on AF and mitral stenosis
are lacking.
However, the RE-LY (Randomized Evalu-
ation of Long Term Anticoagulation Therapy)
trial with dabigatran (14), the ROCKET AF (Rivarox-
aban Once Daily Oral Direct Factor Xa Inhibition
Compared with Vitamin K Antagonism for Prevention
of Stroke and Embolism Trial in Atrial Fibrillation)
trial with rivaroxaban (15), the ARISTOLE (Apixaban

Events in Atrial Fibrillation) trial with apixaban (16),
and
the
ENGAGE

48
(Effective
Anti-
coagulation with factor Xa Next Generation in Atrial
Fibrillation–Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction
48) trial with edoxaban (17) have included variable
proportions
of
VHD
patients,
and
individually
provided no evidence of a differential effect of
NOACs over warfarin in patients with and without
VHD as to the main efficacy and safety outcomes.
However, their individual interpretations are limited
by the still relatively limited numbers of patients in
each trial with various forms of VHD enrolled, and
the variable inclusion criteria. Therefore, we aimed at
assessing if there is a differential effect of NOACs
versus warfarin in the larger sample size provided by
the joint analyses of the 4 pivotal trials, now also
including
the
VHD
patient
subanalysis
of
the
ENGAGE AF–TIMI 48 trial. If patients with AF and
VHD were shown to have a different response to
NOACs
versus
warfarin
compared
with
patients
without VHD, this would have a substantial impact
on patient care. An aggregate evaluation of the rela-
tive performance of the NOACs and warfarin specif-
ically
in
VHD
patients
can
thus
offer
valuable
information on the efficacy and safety of treating
such patients with these drugs.
For
this
reason
we
performed
a
systematic
review and meta-analysis of available comparative
trials
of
NOACs
versus
VKAs
to
provide
such
information.
METHODS
The present meta-analysis was planned, conducted,
and reported in accordance with currently available
statements for design, analysis, and reporting of
meta-analyses
of
randomized
and
observational
studies (18,19).
SEARCH STRATEGY AND SELECTION CRITERIA. We
searched PubMed, the U.S. National Institutes of
Health Clinical Trials Registry (Clinicaltrials.gov), the
Cochrane Library, Web of Science, as well as abstracts
from major cardiology societies’ meetings. Search
terms used were “dabigatran” OR “rivaroxaban” OR
“apixaban” “OR “edoxaban” AND “warfarin” AND
“atrial fibrillation” AND “valvular heart disease”.
We also searched websites, including theheart.org,
escardio.org, and ResearchGate, for relevant mate-
rials. References of the articles identified in this
manner were also searched to locate additional ref-
erences that, although not identified by the search
strategy, might be useful for this meta-analysis.
Two of the authors (G.R. and F.R.) performed the
screening of titles and abstracts, reviewed full-text
articles, and determined their eligibility. The search
was performed for the period between January 2007
and August 2016, and was limited to the English lan-
guage literature. Reviewers were not blinded to study
authors or outcomes. Divergences were resolved by
consensus. We included only phase III randomized
clinical trials (RCTs) comparing the available NOACs
with warfarin in patients with AF. We excluded the
2
phase
III
trials
comparing
ximelagatran
with
warfarin in patients with AF (20,21), because ximela-
gatran was withdrawn from the market in 2006.
DATA
EXTRACTION
AND
QUALITY
ASSESSMENT.
We performed a first pre-specified, trial-based analysis
aimed at comparing primary efficacy and safety out-
comes as stratified by VHD status and randomized
treatment in the 4 phase III RCTs comparing efficacy
and safety of NOACs with warfarin for stroke preven-
tion in patients with AF (6–9). Data were collected from
the 3 published post hoc analyses of RE-LY (14),
ROCKET AF (15), and ARISTOTLE (16), through personal
communication, and through a joint work with the
principal investigator (R.P.G.) of ENGAGE AF–TIMI 48
(17), who is a co-author of this paper.
Outcomes of interest for the current meta-analysis
were stroke or SSEE, major bleeding, intracranial
hemorrhage (ICH), and all-cause death. Ischemic
stroke alone was considered in patients from the

STATISTICAL
ANALYSIS. The
main
meta-analysis
included subgroups of patients randomized to the
higher
dose
of
dabigatran
(150
mg
twice
daily)
enrolled in RE-LY (14), and to the higher dose of
edoxaban (60 mg or reduced dose 30 mg daily for
patients with $1 of the following criteria: creatinine
clearance [CrCl] 30 to 50 ml/min, weight #60 kg, or
concomitant therapy with strong P-glycoprotein in-
hibitors) enrolled in ENGAGE AF–TIMI 48 (17), com-
bined with the single dose of rivaroxaban (20 mg daily
reduced to 15 mg daily for patients with CrCl 30 to 49
ml/min) tested in the ROCKET AF (15), and with the
single dose of apixaban (5 mg twice daily reduced to
2.5
twice
daily
in
patients
with
$2
of
the
following: age $80 years, weight #60 kg, or serum
creatinine $133 mmol/l or 1.5 mg/dl) enrolled in the
ARISTOTLE (16) trials. We selected this strategy to
avoid merging different benefits and risks of various
NOAC doses versus warfarin, and to provide an un-
equivocal interpretation of the results, in agreement
with the strategy adopted in the overall NOAC effect
meta-analysis by Ruff et al. (22). In a secondary
analysis, we combined all doses of all NOACs (both
higher and lower doses of dabigatran and edoxaban,
together with rivaroxaban and apixaban).
The categorical variables are reported as percent-
ages, and continuous variables as mean and standard
deviation
or
median
and
interquartile
range,
as
appropriate. Outcome data were extracted as hazard
ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for
NOACs
versus
warfarin
among
patients
with
or
without VHD. The HRs were considered as risk ratios
(RRs), as previously described (23). We reported un-
adjusted RRs, since adjusted HRs were obtained with
different adjustment models across the 4 trials. RRs
and
corresponding
standard
errors
of
the
mean
(SEMs), which were derived from 95% CIs or p values,
were logarithmically transformed to stabilize vari-
ance
and
normalize
the
distributions.
RRs
were
pooled in a random-effect, generic inverse variance
meta-analysis to compute summary effect sizes of
safety and efficacy of NOACs versus VKAs in patients
with or without VHD. Each study estimate of the
relative treatment was given a weight that was equal
to the inverse of the variance of the effect estimate,
i.e., 1 divided by the squared SEM. To test for sub-
group interactions and to compare the effect size
between VHD and no-VHD subgroups, a Cochran’s
Q test was performed to assess the dispersion of the
summary effects around the combined effect, as
described by Borenstein et al. (24); we considered
evidence of heterogeneity to exist if the p value
was <0.10. We also performed statistical tests allow-
ing to describe the percentage of total variation across
studies that is due to heterogeneity rather than to
chance. This describes the percentage of the vari-
ability in effect estimated from the different sub-
groups that is due to genuine subgroup interactions
rather than sampling error. A value of I2 >50% was
taken as indicating significant heterogeneity. The CIs
of the summary estimates of different subgroups
were also evaluated, with nonoverlap of the confi-
dence intervals indicating statistical significance.
Jackknife sensitivity analyses were also performed
for each endpoint of interest and combining all
doses of all drugs (both higher and lower doses of
dabigatran and of edoxaban together with the single-
dose regimens tested for rivaroxaban and apixaban)
to verify the robustness of the results and the impact
of each single study on the summary estimate of the
effect. Pooled estimates were recalculated multiple
times
using
a
random-effects
model,
each
time
with removal of a single study from the baseline
group (25).
The Cochrane Collaboration Tool was used to
assess risk bias and to evaluate reporting quality
through the following items: random sequence gen-
eration method, allocation concealment, blinding of

RESULTS
We identified 4 studies with the predefined selection
criteria, with an overall population of 13,585 patients
with VHD from a total population of 71,683 patients
(Figure 1).
Table 1 reports the main characteristics of studies
included and related post hoc analyses, and baseline
characteristics of patients grouped by VHD status.
Compared with patients without VHD, patients with
VHD were on average at higher risk because they were
older, had more sustained forms of AF, had higher rate
of heart failure history and of coronary artery disease,
and higher congestive heart failure, hypertension
(CHADS2) scores (with the exception of patients from
ROCKET AF). Table 2 reports the frequency of VHD
subtypes in patients randomized in the 4 trials.
In a total of 13,585 patients with VHD included in
this main analysis, we found a similar rate of SSEE

 (RR: 1.13; 95% CI: 0.99 to 1.28), and significantly
higher rates of major bleeding (RR: 1.30; 95% CI: 1.13
to 1.49) and all-cause death (RR: 1.34; 95% CI: 1.13 to
1.59), compared with the 58,098 patients classified as
without VHD (Online Figures 1A to 1C).
The rate of SSEE in patients treated with higher-
dose NOACs compared with warfarin was lower and
consistent among patients with either VHD (RR: 0.70;
95% CI: 0.58 to 0.86), or without VHD (RR: 0.84; 95%
CI: 0.75 to 0.95; test for subgroup interaction p ¼ 0.13;
I2 ¼ 57%) (Central Illustration). There was no signifi-
cant statistical heterogeneity among the studies (p ¼
0.31; I2 ¼ 16%). We observed a trend towards a better
protection of NOACs versus warfarin in VHD patients
considering ischemic stroke alone in patients from
ARISTOTLE and ENGAGE AF–TIMI 48 trials. This is in
contrast to patients without VHD in whom apixaban
and higher-dose edoxaban did not reduce the risk of
incident ischemic stroke compared with warfarin
(VHD RR: 0.75; 95% CI: 0.56 to 1.02; no-VHD RR: 1.04;
95% CI: 0.89 to 1.22; test for subgroup interaction p ¼
0.06; I2 ¼ 71%) (Online Figure 2).
The rate of major bleeding for patients treated with
higher-dose
NOACs
compared
with
warfarin
was
similar and consistent in patients with either VHD
(RR: 0.93; 95% CI: 0.68 to 1.27), or without VHD (RR:
0.85; 95% CI: 0.70 to 1.02) (test for subgroup inter-
action p ¼ 0.63; I2 ¼ 0%); however, in this case there
was
a
significant
statistical
heterogeneity
across
studies (Cochran’s Q p < 0.0001; I2 ¼ 78%) (Central
Illustration).
Notably,
higher-dose
NOACs
reduced
ICH
compared with warfarin to a similar degree among AF
patients with and without VHD (RR: 0.47; 95% CI:
0.24 to 0.93, and RR: 0.49; 95% CI: 0.41 to 059,
respectively; test for subgroup interaction p ¼ 0.91;
I2 ¼ 0%) (Figure 2). There was also an apparent better
protection from all cause-death in patients without
VHD treated with higher-dose NOACs versus warfarin
compared with patients with VHD (RR: 0.88; 95% CI:
0.82 to 0.94, and RR: 1.01; 95% CI: 0.90 to 1.14,
respectively; test for subgroup interaction p ¼ 0.03,
I2 ¼ 78%) (Figure 3). For these outcomes, we found no
significant statistical heterogeneity among studies.
Finally, we performed an analysis including all
NOAC dose arms studied against warfarin. Also, in
this case, we considered SSEE major bleeding, ICH,
and all-cause death. The results are substantially
similar to those restricted to the higher dose NOACs.
Inclusion of the lower doses of dabigatran and edox-
aban decreased the magnitude of the risk reduction
for SSEE with NOACs versus warfarin and resulted in
less major bleeding than warfarin both in patients
with and without VHD (Online Figures 3A and 3B), as
consistently shown by the jackknife sensitivity anal-
ysis omitting higher or lower doses of dabigatran and
edoxaban together (Online Table 1). Similarly to major
bleeding, the risk reduction of ICH by NOACs versus
warfarin was slightly amplified after the inclusion of
the lower doses in the analysis, but ICH was reduced
consistently
both
in
VHD
and
no-VHD
patients
(Online Figure 4A). Conversely, the inclusion of lower
doses did not modify the relative risk of all-cause
death (Online Figure 4B).
Sensitivity analyses showed that some studies
significantly affected the pooled RRs for SSEE and
major
bleeding
(Online
Table
2).
Particularly,
compared with the overall analysis, exclusion of the
lower-dose edoxaban arm improved the risk reduc-
tion of SSEE by the remaining NOACs versus warfarin
in patients without VHD; the exclusion of rivaroxaban
improved the risk reduction of major bleeding by the
remaining NOACs versus warfarin in patients with
VHD, whereas the exclusion of apixaban diminished
this risk reduction (Online Table 2).
Qualitatively, the overall risk of reporting bias was
low according to the Cochrane Collaboration Tool
classification (26) (Online Figure 5).
DISCUSSION
The present meta-analysis suggests that, compared
with patients with AF without VHD, patients with AF
and VHD: 1) were on average at higher risk (they were
older, had more frequently sustained AF, had a higher
prevalence of heart failure and coronary artery dis-
ease, and a higher CHADS2 score); and 2) had higher
rates
of
major
bleeding
and
all-cause
death.
The present meta-analysis also however indicates
that 3) the efficacy and safety of NOACs versus

NOACs for VHD in AF

 warfarin is consistent in AF patients with and without
VHD included in phase III trials. Indeed, for all pri-
mary efficacy and safety outcomes in all 4 RCTs
comparing NOACs with warfarin in patients with AF,
we found that coexisting VHD did not affect the
overall relative protection of NOACs in terms of pre-
vention of SSEE and major bleeding.
As shown in Table 1, there were different defini-
tions of VHD in the 4 phase III trials and patients had
variable
types
of
VHD.
Therefore,
VHD
patients
allowed in the various trials, despite substantially
overlapping, also differed in several aspects, making
the
overall
interpretation
of
findings
potentially
difficult. Our results, however, show similar or better
outcomes
with
NOACs
versus
warfarin
in
VHD
patients, and provide reassurance in treating AF
patients with the types of VHD here studied.
Post hoc analyses of the individual phase III trials
of NOACs versus warfarin have indicated that VHD
patients have higher rates of several efficacy and
safety outcomes compared with patients without
VHD. Indeed, compared with no-VHD, VHD patients
from the RE-LY trial had similar risk of SSEE and
death and higher risk of major bleeding (14); VHD
patients from the ENGAGE AF–TIMI 48 (17) trial had
similar risk of SSEE and higher risks of death and
major bleeding; VHD patients from ARISTOTLE (16)
had higher risk of SSEE, death, and a trend towards
higher risk of major bleeding; and VHD patients from
ROCKET AF (15) had higher risks of systemic embo-
lism events alone and major bleeding. Our analysis
confirmed that VHD patients overall have a trend to
higher risk of SSEE, and significantly higher risk of
major bleeding and all-cause death.
We found that the better protection of NOACs
versus warfarin in terms of prevention of SSEE was
consistent among patients with or without VHD.
Furthermore, our subanalysis of the ARISTOTLE and
ENGAGE AF–TIMI 48 trials, reporting ischemic stroke
or systemic embolism events in isolation in the VHD/
no-VHD groups, whereby the test for interaction was
of borderline statistical significance, favored apix-
aban and higher-dose edoxaban in patients with VHD
(p

 protective effect of higher-dose NOACs in terms of
prevention of all-cause death seemed not to be pre-
sent in patients with VHD. The reasons for this,
especially with regard to the latter finding, are un-
clear. The finding of an apparent lesser protection
from death by NOACs in the VHD versus the no-VHD
group may be spurious, or alternatively related to a
different sensitivity of some components of death to
the effect of NOACs versus warfarin in VHD patients
(2). However, the small number of death events may
also have caused a Type I error. In any case, for all-
cause death the overall HR in VHD patients was
here found to be exactly 1.00, suggesting, also in this
case, no overall harm for NOACs versus warfarin in
VHD patients.
Conversely, pooled results of other safety end-
points,
such
as
major
bleeding
and
ICH,
were
consistent with the main results from the original
trials, which showed a tendency toward fewer major
bleeding and a 50% reduction in ICH (22). Hence,
the
information
from
the
4
phase
III
trials
is
complementary, and the overall message of this
meta-analysis is that, despite their higher thrombo-
embolic and hemorrhagic risk, VHD patients are pro-
tected with NOACs at least as well as patients without
VHD.
We could not analyze data according to sub-
types of native valve disease or valve procedures/
surgeries because of the lack of homogeneous data.
However, in a subanalysis by location of valve disease
performed in VHD patients from ARISTOTLE (16) and
ENGAGE AF–TIMI 48 (17), it has been shown that both
the subgroup of patients with mitral valve disease
and those with aortic valve disease had consistent
benefits of apixaban and edoxaban versus warfarin
for prevention of SSEE and major bleeding. Similar
benefits of apixaban in comparison with warfarin
were also reported as seen in patients with tricuspid
valve disease and in patients with previous valve
surgery (data not shown) and without a distinction
between different types of surgery (16). In a retro-
spective analysis of ROCKET AF (27), patients with
aortic stenosis had the highest rates of efficacy and
safety
outcomes,

 interactions among patients randomized to rivarox-
aban and warfarin across the 3 subgroups of mitral
regurgitation þ aortic regurgitation, aortic stenosis,
and no-VHD patients, for all efficacy endpoints,
including
SSEE.
However,
patients
with
mitral
regurgitation or aortic regurgitation had an elevated
risk of major bleeding with rivaroxaban compared
with warfarin. Finally, in a post hoc analysis of the
RE-LY trial (14), outcomes were not different between
patients with mild rheumatic mitral stenosis and
patients without VHD; also, in patients with exclusive
right-sided valve lesions, outcomes were similar as in
patients without VHD.
STUDY LIMITATIONS. First, our analysis was based
on aggregate data abstracted from original publica-
tions, but not on individual patient-level data. This
prevented us from conducting in-depth subgroup
analyses or meta-regressions.
Second, original RCTs had different designs: one
of these, RE-LY, was open-label, whereas the others
were double-blinded. Moreover, inclusion/exclusion
criteria were different, and the definition and subtypes
of
VHD
were
not
consistent
across
the
studies.
Furthermore, classification of valvular lesions and
severity relied largely on clinical data collected in the
case report forms, and only in a small proportion of
patient (from ARISTOTLE and ENGAGE AF–TIMI 48)
on detailed echocardiographic information on VHD.
This heterogeneity may be a further limitation to
conclusions.
Third,
the
significant
statistical
between-trials
heterogeneity
observed
in
the
analysis of
major
bleeding
and
the
high
degree
of
uncertainty
of
sensitivity analyses for the endpoints of interest may
affect the robustness of the results. This reflects the
heterogeneity of results from the 4 main RCTs in
terms of efficacy and safety outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS
In patients with AF and VHD (other than moderate/
severe mitral stenosis or mechanical heart valves)
NOACs are attractive alternatives to VKAs because
the coexistence of VHD does not affect the overall
relative efficacy or safety of NOACs in terms of

PERSPECTIVES
COMPETENCY IN MEDICAL KNOWLEDGE: In the phase III
trials comparing NOACs with warfarin in patients with AF, the
relative efficacy and safety of NOACs were similar in patients
with or without mitral insufficiency, aortic stenosis, aortic
insufficiency, bioprosthetic valves, or valve repair surgery,
suggesting that NOACs can be safely used in patients without
moderate-to-severe mitral stenosis or mechanical valves.
TRANSLATIONAL OUTLOOK: Future trials should specif-
ically address patients with bioprosthetic heart valves and
valve repair surgery who were relatively underrepresented in
trials performed to date.
