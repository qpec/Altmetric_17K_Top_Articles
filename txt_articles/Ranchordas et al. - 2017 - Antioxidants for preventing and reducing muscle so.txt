Background
Muscle soreness typically occurs after intense exercise, unaccustomed exercise or actions that involve eccentric contractions where the
muscle lengthens while under tension. It peaks between 24 and 72 hours after the initial bout of exercise. Many people take antioxidant
supplements or antioxidant-enriched foods before and after exercise in the belief that these will prevent or reduce muscle soreness after
exercise.
Objectives
To assess the effects (benefits and harms) of antioxidant supplements and antioxidant-enriched foods for preventing and reducing the
severity and duration of delayed onset muscle soreness following exercise.
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled
Trials, MEDLINE, Embase, SPORTDiscus, trial registers, reference lists of articles and conference proceedings up to February 2017.
Selection criteria
We included randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials investigating the effects of all forms of antioxidant supplementation
including specific antioxidant supplements (e.g. tablets, powders, concentrates) and antioxidant-enriched foods or diets on preventing
or reducing delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS). We excluded studies where antioxidant supplementation was combined with
another supplement.
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently screened search results, assessed risk of bias and extracted data from included trials using a pre-
piloted form. Where appropriate, we pooled results of comparable trials, generally using the random-effects model. The outcomes
selected for presentation in the ’Summary of findings’ table were muscle soreness, collected at times up to 6 hours, 24, 48, 72 and 96
hours post-exercise, subjective recovery and adverse effects. We assessed the quality of the evidence using GRADE.

Antioxidants for preventing and reducing muscle soreness after exercise (Review)

 Main results
Fifty randomised, placebo-controlled trials were included, 12 of which used a cross-over design. Of the 1089 participants, 961 (88.2%)
were male and 128 (11.8%) were female. The age range for participants was between 16 and 55 years and training status varied from
sedentary to moderately trained. The trials were heterogeneous, including the timing (pre-exercise or post-exercise), frequency, dose,
duration and type of antioxidant supplementation, and the type of preceding exercise. All studies used an antioxidant dosage higher
than the recommended daily amount. The majority of trials (47) had design features that carried a high risk of bias due to selective
reporting and poorly described allocation concealment, potentially limiting the reliability of their findings.
We tested only one comparison: antioxidant supplements versus control (placebo). No studies compared high-dose versus low-dose,
where the low-dose supplementation was within normal or recommended levels for the antioxidant involved.
Pooled results for muscle soreness indicated a small difference in favour of antioxidant supplementation after DOMS-inducing exercise
at all main follow-ups: up to 6 hours (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.30, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.56 to -0.04; 525
participants, 21 studies; low-quality evidence); at 24 hours (SMD -0.13, 95% CI -0.27 to 0.00; 936 participants, 41 studies; moderate-
quality evidence); at 48 hours (SMD -0.24, 95% CI -0.42 to -0.07; 1047 participants, 45 studies; low-quality evidence); at 72 hours
(SMD -0.19, 95% CI -0.38 to -0.00; 657 participants, 28 studies; moderate-quality evidence), and little difference at 96 hours (SMD
-0.05, 95% CI -0.29 to 0.19; 436 participants, 17 studies; low-quality evidence). When we rescaled to a 0 to 10 cm scale in order to
quantify the actual difference between groups, we found that the 95% CIs for all five follow-up times were all well below the minimal
important difference of 1.4 cm: up to 6 hours (MD -0.52, 95% CI -0.95 to -0.08); at 24 hours (MD -0.17, 95% CI -0.42 to 0.07); at
48 hours (MD -0.41, 95% CI -0.69 to -0.12); at 72 hours (MD -0.29, 95% CI -0.59 to 0.02); and at 96 hours (MD -0.03, 95% CI -
0.43 to 0.37). Thus, the effect sizes suggesting less muscle soreness with antioxidant supplementation were very unlikely to equate to
meaningful or important differences in practice. Neither of our subgroup analyses to examine for differences in effect according to type
of DOMS-inducing exercise (mechanical versus whole body aerobic) or according to funding source confirmed subgroup differences.
Sensitivity analyses excluding cross-over trials showed that their inclusion had no important impact on results.
None of the 50 included trials measured subjective recovery (return to previous activities without signs or symptoms).
There is very little evidence regarding the potential adverse effects of taking antioxidant supplements as this outcome was reported in
only nine trials (216 participants). From the studies that did report adverse effects, two of the nine trials found adverse effects. All six
participants in the antioxidant group of one trial had diarrhoea and four of these also had mild indigestion; these are well-known side
effects of the particular antioxidant used in this trial. One of 26 participants in a second trial had mild gastrointestinal distress.
Authors’ conclusions
There is moderate to low-quality evidence that high dose antioxidant supplementation does not result in a clinically relevant reduction
of muscle soreness after exercise at up to 6 hours or at 24, 48, 72 and 96 hours after exercise. There is no evidence available on subjective
recovery and only limited evidence on the adverse effects of taking antioxidant supplements. The findings of, and messages from,
this review provide an opportunity for researchers and other stakeholders to come together and consider what are the priorities, and
underlying justifications, for future research in this area.

Antioxidants for preventing and reducing muscle soreness after exercise
Background and aim of the review
Muscle soreness typically occurs after intense or unaccustomed exercise. It peaks between 24 and 72 hours after the initial bout of
exercise. Many people take antioxidant supplements such as vitamin C and/or E or antioxidant-enriched foods such as tart cherry or
pomegranate juice before and after exercise in the belief that these will prevent or reduce muscle soreness after exercise.
Results of the search
We searched medical databases up to February 2017 for studies that compared antioxidant supplementation with a control intervention
such as a placebo (a dummy pill or drink that had no antioxidant) or no treatment. We found 50 studies, all of which compared
antioxidant supplementation with a placebo. These reported results for a total of 1089 participants. Of these, nearly 9 out of 10 were
male. The age range for participants was between 16 and 55 years and their training status varied from sedentary to moderately trained.

Antioxidants for preventing and reducing muscle soreness after exercise (Review)
Copyright © 2017 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
 The studies were very varied such as in the type and dosage of the antioxidant supplement and the type of exercises used to cause muscle
soreness. All studies used an antioxidant dosage higher than the recommended daily amount.
Key results
There is evidence that high dose antioxidant supplementation may slightly reduce muscle soreness at up to 6 hours and at 24, 48 and
72 hours follow-up but not at 96 hours. However, these reductions were so small that they were unlikely to make any difference. None
of the trials reported on outcomes related to subjective recovery, such as return to previous activities without signs or symptoms.
Only nine studies reported on adverse effects and only two found adverse effects. All six participants in the antioxidant group of one
trial had diarrhoea and four of these also had mild indigestion; these are well-known side effects of the particular antioxidant used in
this study. One of 26 participants in a second trial had mild gastrointestinal distress.
Quality of the evidence
We considered the evidence for muscle soreness to be ’moderate’ or ’low’ quality. This was mainly because the majority of studies had
aspects that could have affected the reliability of their results and in some cases because of variation in the results of the studies. This
means there is some uncertainty about the findings and further research may provide evidence that could change our conclusions.
Authors’ conclusions
Antioxidant supplementation does not appear to reduce muscle soreness early on or at one, two, three or four days after exercise.

High quality: Further research is very unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect. Thus we are confident that the true effect lies close to what was found in the
research
Moderate quality: Further research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate. Thus, the true effect is likely
to be close to what was found, but there is a possibility that it is substantially different
Low quality: Further research is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and is likely to change the estimate. Thus, the true effect
may be substantially different from what was found
Very low quality: We are very uncertain about the estimate.
1Although some participants were sedentary, the majority of participants were recreationally active or moderately trained
athletes. No data were included from highly trained elite athletes. Most trial participants were male.
2Muscle damage was induced either mechanically (e.g. resistance-based exercise) or through whole body aerobic exercise
(e.g. running, cycling, bench stepping).

 3Typically, supplementation was taken before, the day of and after exercise for up to several days. The supplements were
all taken orally, either as capsules, powders or drinks. All studies used an antioxidant dosage higher than the recommended
daily amount.

Description of the condition
Muscle soreness after exercise is commonly referred to as delayed
onset muscle soreness (DOMS) (Cheung 2003). DOMS is com-
mon in individuals who engage in strenuous and unaccustomed
exercise and physical activity. It is classified as a grade 1 muscle
strain injury and is characterised by localised tenderness and sore-
ness (Cheung 2003). DOMS typically peaks between 24 to 72
hours after a bout of exercise but eventually disappears after five
to seven days (Armstrong 1984; Bieuzen 2013; Bleakley 2012;
Byrnes 1986; Cleak 1992; Costello 2015).
DOMS is particularly associated with exercise involving eccentric
muscle action, such as in downhill running. An eccentric action is
where a muscle generates tension to control the rate it lengthens
(Close 2005), and it can cause significant muscle damage. DOMS
could be detrimental for athletes who are returning to training
from a prolonged period of inactivity. In addition, DOMS could
deter individuals from adhering to an exercise programme. For
some individuals, DOMS could result from excessive physical ac-
tivity associated with daily living, particularly if repeated eccentric
movements or unaccustomed physical activity are involved.
Several theorieshave beenproposedtoexplainthe mechanismsun-
derlying DOMS. These include lactate accumulation (Asmussen
1953), inflammation (Smith 1991), muscle spasm (De Vries
1966), muscle damage (Hough 1900), connective tissue dam-
age (Weinstock 1997), and increased muscle temperature (Davies
1972). A common feature of several of these proposed mechanisms
is an increased production of free radicals (Maughan 1989), and
reactive oxygen species. Indeed, it has been shown that reactive
oxygen species are produced in nearly every biological process and
that they also play a crucial role as signalling molecules for trans-
lating the exercise signals to appropriate adaptations (Margaritelis
2016).
Description of the intervention
Taking dietary antioxidants in the form of supplements (e.g.
tablets, capsules, powders) or antioxidant-enriched foods (e.g.
food concentrates) in doses much higher than the recommended
amounts (up to 10 times the recommended daily amounts) sev-
eral days before and after exercise has been proposed as a way
to prevent or reduce muscle soreness after exercise. Two sources
of antioxidants exist: exogenous (i.e. from dietary sources) and
endogenous (i.e. produced by the body) (Watson 2010). Exoge-
nous antioxidants include vitamin C, vitamin E, polyphenols,
glutathione, carotenoids and coenzyme Q10. These are typically
found in plant sources such as dark-coloured vegetables, citrus
fruits, legumes, nuts, grains, seeds and oils. Endogenous antiox-
idants include plasma proteins, bilirubin, uric acid and the en-
zymes superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase and catalase
(Watson 2010).
How the intervention might work
It has been reported that although physical activity is beneficial
to health, any type of exercise causes oxidative stress, partly due
to increased oxygen consumption, and could deplete the body’s
antioxidant defences and increase the rate of free radical produc-
tion (Powers 2008; Ramel 2004; Witt 1992). Moreover, unaccus-
tomed, eccentric or exhaustive exercise may also induce inflam-
matory reactions that can contribute to increased reactive oxygen
species production and reduced antioxidant defences (Tsai 2001),
causing exercise-induced muscle damage and resulting in DOMS
(Cheung 2003). Dietary antioxidants may counteract oxidative
stress by reducing the concentration of free radicals and reactive
oxygen species associated with exercise (Powers 2008). Reducing
DOMS could be beneficial to athletes when returning to training
from injury (i.e. after a period of inactivity), and it could help
sedentary and older individuals recover from unaccustomed phys-
ical activity.
Why it is important to do this review
The ease of taking antioxidant supplements to prevent and re-
duce muscle soreness after exercise and enhance recovery makes
this an attractive option for physically active individuals. More-
over, antioxidant supplements are available to buy from supermar-
kets and health food stores and some are marketed to enhance
recovery. However, our initial look at the evidence based on a
small sample of the trials testing antioxidants for reducing DOMS
showed that the evidence to support these claims was mixed (Bryer
2006; Howatson 2010; Mastaloudis 2006). There is conflicting
evidence, too, on the potential for adverse effects of taking antiox-
idant supplements including impairment of post-exercise adap-
tations both acutely (Gomez-Cabrera 2008; Ristow 2009) and
chronically (Paulsen 2014). All these pointed to the need for a
systematic review of all the available trials.

 Criteria for considering studies for this review
Types of studies
All randomised controlled trials and quasi-randomised controlled
trials (a method of allocating participants to groups that is not truly
random; e.g. allocation by date of birth, day of the week, medical
record number) investigating the effects of dietary antioxidants
on preventing or reducing delayed onset muscle soreness. Only
studies that measured muscle soreness and/or muscle tenderness
were included in this study.
Types of participants
People of anyage andlevel of physical orsportsactivity, performing
exercise (i.e. eccentric, high-intensity, unaccustomed exercise) that
is likely to induce DOMS. We included studies that used any type
of exercise protocol.
Types of interventions
All forms of antioxidant supplementation including specific an-
tioxidant supplements (i.e. tablets, powders, concentrates) and an-
tioxidant-enriched foods or diets. No restrictions were placed on
timing (pre-exercise or post-exercise), frequency, dose or duration,
or type of antioxidant supplementation. Interventions that used
more than one antioxidant (e.g. a combination of vitamins C and
E) were also included.
We set out two comparisons.
• Antioxidant supplementation versus placebo or no
supplementation.
• High-dose versus low-dose, where the low-dose
supplementation is within normal or recommended levels for the
antioxidant involved.
Types of outcome measures
Trials that did not record muscle soreness (pain) were not included
in the review.
Primary outcomes
1. Muscle soreness (pain) - typically measured by a visual
analogue scale (i.e. subjective)
2. Subjective recovery (return to previous activities without
signs or symptoms)
3. Adverse effects (e.g. intestinal discomfort, diarrhoea)
Secondary outcomes
1. Muscle tenderness - typically measured using a handheld
algometer
2. Performance variables (e.g. vertical jump, speed, agility)
3. Muscle force production (objective measures of muscle
strength or power)
4. Range of motion
Timing of outcome measurement
Where appropriate, we extracted outcome data for the following
time periods: the day of exercise, and daily up to seven days post-
exercise.
Search methods for identification of studies
Electronic searches
We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group
Specialised Register (6 February 2017), the Cochrane Central Reg-
ister of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (2017, Issue 2), MED-
LINE (including Epub Ahead of Print, In-Process & Other Non-
Indexed Citations and Ovid MEDLINE Daily) (1946 to 3 Febru-
ary 2017), Embase (1980 to 2017 Week 5) and SPORTDiscus
(1949 to 20 April 2017). We also searched ClinicalTrials.gov and
the World Health Organization Clinical Trials Registry Platform
for ongoing and recently completed studies (to 6 February 2017).
In MEDLINE, we combined a subject-specific search with the
sensitivity-maximising version of the Cochrane Highly Sensitive
Search Strategy for identifying randomised trials (Lefebvre 2011).
The search strategies for MEDLINE, CENTRAL, Embase and
SPORTDiscus are shown in Appendix 1.
We applied no language restrictions.
Searching other resources
We contacted experts in the field (identified by the lead authors
in published studies) to find unpublished trials. We checked the
bibliographies of included studies and relevant reviews for further
references to relevant trials.
Data collection and analysis
Selection of studies
Two authors (MR and DR) independently screened the titles,
abstracts and descriptors of the studies retrieved from the searches.
Studies that appeared meet the inclusion criteria were selected
and the above two authors independently reviewed the full-text
articles. Any disagreements about study selection were resolved
by consultation with the third and fourth author (HS and JC).
If required, we contacted study authors for further information;
this, however, did not include contacting authors to check whether
DOMS had been measured where not stated in the trial reports.

 Data extraction and management
Two authors (MR and DR) independently extracted data using
a pre-piloted data extraction form. We resolved any discrepancies
that could not be settled by discussion by consultation with the
third and fourth authors (HS and JC). Where necessary, we con-
tacted primary authors of selected studies for additional informa-
tion and data.
Assessment of risk of bias in included studies
Two authors (MR and DR) independently assessed the risk of bias
in the included studies using the guidelines and criteria outlined
in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions
(Higgins 2011). We assessed the included studies for selection bias
(random sequence generation and allocation concealment), per-
formance bias (blinding of participants and personnel), detection
bias (blinding of outcome assessment), attrition bias (incomplete
outcome data), reporting bias (selective reporting) and any other
sources of bias. We resolved any disagreement by discussion and,
where necessary, consultation with the third author and forth au-
thor (HS and JC).
Measures of treatment effect
We calculated mean differences with 95% confidence intervals for
continuous data. We calculated standardised mean differences and
95% confidence intervals when combining results from studies
using different ways of measuring a continuous outcome. Where
possible, we used follow-up scores in preference to change scores.
Should dichotomous data have been available, we planned to cal-
culate risk ratios with 95% confidence intervals.
Unit of analysis issues
The unit of randomisation in the included trials was the individual
participant. Some trials reported the same outcomes at more than
one time point (e.g. soreness measured immediately after exercise,
one day post-exercise, two days post-exercise, three days post-ex-
ercise and so on). As planned, we extracted and presented data for
the above listed time points up to seven days post-exercise. We
consulted a statistician to discuss the appropriate use and process-
ing of data from cross-over trials that were included in the review.
For these, we extracted data at each time point and analysed the
data as if a parallel design was employed (Deeks 2011). We judged
that there was an adequate washout period in each of the trials.
Dealing with missing data
Where there were missing data for an included study, we con-
tacted the primary study author via email. We ignored data miss-
ing at random and focused only on the available data. Where ap-
propriate, we conducted intention-to-treat analyses in which all
randomised participants are analysed in the groups to which they
were originally assigned. While planned, there were insufficient
data (often missing denominators) to conduct worst-case and best-
case scenario sensitivity analyses to examine the potential effects of
dropouts and exclusions. We contacted authors for missing mean
and standard deviations. Where data were not available in the
manuscript and the authors did not respond we extracted data
from graphs using Graphclick 2010.
Assessment of heterogeneity
We visually evaluated heterogeneity between comparable trials us-
ing forest plots, and the Chi² test and I² statistic, with the level of
significance for the Chi² test being set at P = 0.1 (Deeks 2011).
Thus, we considered a P value for Chi² of < 0.1 to indicate statis-
tically significant heterogeneity between studies. We interpreted
values of I² as follows: 0% to 40% might not be important; 30%
to 60% may represent moderate heterogeneity; 50% to 90% may
represent substantial heterogeneity; and 75% to 100% may rep-
resent considerable heterogeneity.
Assessment of reporting biases
In view of the difficulty of detecting and correcting for publica-
tion bias and other reporting biases, we aimed to minimise their
potential impact by ensuring a comprehensive search for eligible
studies and by being alert for duplication of data. Where there
were 10 or more studies in an analysis, we planned to use a funnel
plot to explore the possibility of small-study effects (a tendency for
estimates of the intervention effect to be more beneficial in smaller
studies). (We restricted these to DOMS at 24 and 48 hours given
these were the time periods for which the majority of data were
available.)
Data synthesis
If considered appropriate, we pooled the results of comparable
groups of trials. Initially we used the fixed-effect model and 95%
confidence intervals but then selected the random-effects model,
again with 95% confidence intervals, because of the substantial
clinical and statistically significant heterogeneity.
Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity
As described in Differences between protocol and review, we mod-
ified our list of planned subgroup analyses, which involved the
removal of one (antioxidant supplement versus antioxidant-en-
riched food) and the merging of two subgroups relating to type
of exercise (normal sporting activities versus laboratory-induced
DOMS; exercise that requires high oxygen consumption (e.g. run-
ning, cycling) versus exercise that requires low oxygen consump-
tion (e.g. eccentric exercise in one arm). We also added in a sub-
group analysis relating to source of funding.
Our revised list of planned subgroup analyses is as follows.
• Treatment intervention
11
Antioxidants for preventing and reducing muscle soreness after exercise (Review)

 ◦ Timing of administration (pre-exercise or post-
exercise)
• Type of exercise
◦ Mechanically induced damage (e.g. resistance exercise)
versus whole body aerobic exercise (e.g. running)
• Funding source
◦ Trials funded by food company or provider of
antioxidant supplements versus those not funded by food
company or provider of antioxidant supplements
To test whether subgroups were statistically significantly different
from one another, we used the test for subgroup differences avail-
able in the Review Manager 5 software (RevMan 2014).
Sensitivity analysis
Where sufficientdatawere available,we performedsensitivityanal-
yses to investigate the effects of various aspects of trial and review
methodology. We performed limited sensitivity analyses to explore
the effects of inclusion of trials at high or unclear risk of selection
bias, principally from lack of or unclear allocation concealment,
the effects of including cross-over trials, and from the choice of
model for data synthesis (fixed-effect compared with random-ef-
fects). We did not conduct our other planned sensitivity analyses
to explore the effects of inclusion of trials at high risk of selection
bias specifically because of lack of allocation concealment, or for
which only abstracts were obtained, or the effects of missing data.
’Summary of findings’ table
We prepared a ’Summary of findings’ table for the main compar-
ison (antioxidant supplementation versus a placebo intervention)
(Schünemann 2011). We summarised the quality of evidence by
applying the principles of the GRADE framework and following
the recommendations and worksheets of the Cochrane Effective
Practice and Organisation of Care Group for creating ’Summary
of findings’ tables (EPOC 2013). We assessed the quality of the
evidence according to four levels (high, moderate, low and very
low). We selected muscle soreness up to 6 hours after exercise, 24,
48, 72 and 96 hours; subjective recovery and adverse events for
presentation in a ’Summary of findings’ table.

Description of studies
Results of the search
The search was completed in February 2017. We screened a total
of 1558 records from the following databases: Cochrane Bone,
Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register (25 records),
CENTRAL (194), MEDLINE (302), Embase (476), SPORTDis-
cus (117), ClinicalTrials.gov (162) and the WHO International
Clinical Trials Registry Platform (282). We also identified 12 po-
tentially eligible studies from ongoing searches and through con-
tacting experts in the field.
The search resulted in the identification of 128 potentially eligi-
ble studies, for which we obtained full reports. Upon study selec-
tion, we included 50 (see Included studies) and excluded 77 (see
Excluded studies). One study is ongoing (NCT02281981). A flow
diagram summarising the study selection process is presented in
Figure 1.

 Included studies
We included 50 studies with a total of 1089 participants of which
48 studies with 1043 participants were included in the quanti-
tative synthesis (meta-analysis) for muscle soreness. All the stud-
ies were reported in English in peer-reviewed journals, in articles
published between 1992 to 2016. Details of the individual studies
are provided in Characteristics of included studies.
We contacted the authors of 33 studies to request for raw data for
delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS), maximal voluntary iso-
metric contraction (MVIC), range of motion (ROM) and perfor-
mance measures. Nineteen authors responded to our request (Bell

With the exception of Herrlinger 2015, we successfully extracted
data from graphs for the other 13 studies in the second category
using GraphClick, Arizona (version 3.0.2, 2010).
The two studies not included in the quantitative analyses for
DOMS were Herrlinger 2015 and McCormick 2016. This re-
sulted in the loss of 37 participants for whom DOMS data
were missing for Herrlinger 2015 and of nine participants for
McCormick 2016. We only included the data for McCormick
2016 in the qualitative analysis because the exercise paradigm was
completely different to all the other studies included in this review.
The other studies used an exercise paradigm where mechanical or
whole body aerobic exercise was used to cause muscle damage and
then a range of outcomes such as muscle soreness, muscle func-
tion, range of motion and performance were measured at various
time points up to several days after exercise. However, participants
in McCormick 2016 had a fixed daily training regimen for five
continuous days performance, with outcomes being measured at
the start and then throughout the trial. Thus the severity of muscle
damage caused by the daily training regimen was not controlled.
Design
All 50 studies were randomised controlled trials; no quasi-ran-
domised controlled trials met the inclusion criteria. Thirty-eight
trials (with a total of 901 participants) employed a parallel design.
The other 12 trials (with a total of 188 participants) employed a
cross-over design (Arent 2010; Connolly 2006a; Kaminski 1992;
McCormick 2016; McLeay 2012; Michailidis 2013; Nicol 2015;
Peschek 2014; Tanabe 2015; Thompson 2001; Trombold 2010;
Trombold 2011). The time betweeninterventionarmsinthe cross-
over trials was five days in Arent 2010; 14 days in Connolly 2006a,
Nicol 2015, Thompson 2001, Trombold 2010 and Trombold
2011; 21 days in Kaminski 1992 and Peschek 2014; 28 days in
Tanabe 2015; 30 days in McLeay 2012; 35 days in McCormick
2016 and 42 days in Michailidis 2013.
Three studies had three groups: Herrlinger 2015 compared low-
dose phenolic blend (12 participants) versus high-dose phenolic
blend (12 participants) versus placebo (13 participants); Kerksick
2009 compared epigallocatechin gallate supplementation (10 par-
ticipants) versus N-acetyl cysteine supplementation (10 partici-
pants) versus placebo (10 participants); and Silva 2008 compared
N-acetyl cysteine (nine participants) versus N-acetyl cysteine plus
placebo (eight participants) versus placebo (eight participants).
Sample sizes
The 50 trials included a total of 1089 participants with 901 par-
ticipants in the parallel-group trials (range 7 to 54) and 188 par-
ticipants in the cross-over trials (range 8 to 24).
Setting
Twenty-four studies were conducted in the USA (Arent 2010;
Avery 2003; Beaton 2002a; Bloomer 2004; Bloomer 2005;
Bloomer 2007; Bryer 2006; Connolly 2006; Connolly 2006a;
Goldfarb 2011; He 2015; Herrlinger 2015; Hutchinson 2016;

McFarlin 2016; O’Connor 2013; O’Fallon 2012; Peschek 2014;
Phillips 2003; Trombold 2010; Trombold 2011); 12 studies
were carried out in the UK (Bailey 2011; Bell 2015; Bell 2016;
Close 2006; Cobley 2011; Howatson 2009; Laupheimer 2014;
Lynn 2015; Thompson 2001; Thompson 2001a; Thompson
2003; Thompson 2004); two studies were conducted in Australia
(McCormick 2016; Nicol 2015); two studies in Brazil (Silva 2008;
Silva 2010); two studies in China (Nie 2004; Su 2008); two stud-
ies in Greece (Michailidis 2013; Theodorou 2011); one study in
Iran (Meamarbashi 2011); one study in Ireland (Shafat 2004); one
study in Japan (Tanabe 2015); one study in New Zealand (McLeay
2012); one study in Poland (Krotkiewski 1994); and one study in
Spain (Drobnic 2014).
Seven trials were designed to produce DOMS under field-based
conditions (Bailey 2011; Cobley 2011; Howatson 2009; Kuehl
2010; Laupheimer 2014; Lynn 2015; McCormick 2016), and the
other 43 studies were designed to produce DOMS under labora-
tory-based conditions.

 Details of the funding of individual studies are given in
Characteristics of included studies. In all, 21 studies were indus-
try funded either by a food company or a provider of antioxi-
dant supplements (Arent 2010; Bailey 2011; Beaton 2002a; Bell
2015; Bell 2016; Bloomer 2005; Bloomer 2007; Connolly 2006a;

Thompson 2001; Thompson 2001a; Thompson 2003; Trombold
2010; Trombold 2011). Of the 28 other studies reporting on fund-
ing, 15 declared “none” in their report (Avery 2003; Bloomer
2004; Bryer 2006; Close 2006; Cobley 2011; Connolly 2006;
Drobnic 2014; Hutchinson 2016; Kaminski 1992; Laupheimer
2014; McBride 1997; Nie 2004; Shafat 2004; Theodorou 2011;
Thompson 2004); the other 13 referring to various sources of
university and public body research funding sources (Goldfarb
2011; He 2015; Howatson 2009; Krotkiewski 1994; Lynn 2015;
McCormick 2016; McLeay 2012; Meamarbashi 2011; Michailidis
2013; Nicol 2015; O’Fallon 2012; Silva 2008; Silva 2010). We
were unsuccessful in obtaining information on funding from the
only trial that did not report on this (Su 2008).
Participants
Of the 1089participants, 961(88.2%)were male and128(11.8%)
were female. Two studies recruited females only (Bloomer 2004;
McLeay 2012). The age range of participants was between 16
(Nie 2004) and 55 years (Laupheimer 2014). The majority of
the studies recruited recreationally active or moderately trained
participants with the exception of seven studies (Bryer 2006;
Kerksick 2009; Meamarbashi 2011; O’Connor 2013; O’Fallon
2012; Phillips 2003; Tanabe 2015), which included a total of
193 sedentary participants. One study had a sample of 16 semi-
professional soccer players (Bell 2016) and one study (Laupheimer
2014) had seven well-trained distance runners. Only McCormick
2016 had participants (nine in all) who were classed as highly-
trained elite athletes.
Details of exercise
There was a range of different exercise models used to induce mus-
cle damage. Twenty-eight studies used mechanically induced exer-
cise (i.e. resistance-based exercise) and 22 studies used whole body
aerobic exercise (i.e. running, cycling, bench stepping). The ma-
jority of the studies that used mechanically induced exercise em-
ployed some form of resistance training protocol using weights or
an isokinetic dynamometer to induce delayed onset muscle dam-
age and soreness with large variances on number of repetitions,
sets and percentage of load used. One study used a circuit train-
ing session where participants rotated round a circuit of cycling
and stepping exercises (Krotkiewski 1994). Two studies used a re-
peated maximal sprint protocol on a cycle ergometer (Arent 2010;
Bell 2016), one study used a repeated bench stepping protocol
(Meamarbashi 2011), and one study used a repeated squat jump
protocol using a weighted jacket (Nie 2004). Sixteen studies used a
running model: seven trials used a downhill running protocol on a
treadmill (Close 2006; Drobnic 2014; He 2015; Herrlinger 2015
Peschek 2014; Su 2008; Thompson 2004); four trials used the 90
minute Loughborough Intermittent Shuttle Running Test (LIST)
(Bailey 2011; Thompson 2001; Thompson 2001a; Thompson
2003); one study used the Yo-Yo IR 1 repeated sprint test (Cobley
2011), and three trials used a competitive running race to induce
damage. Howatson 2009 and Laupheimer 2014 used the London
marathon, one study used the ultra-endurance Hood Coast Relay,
which is based in the United States (Kuehl 2010), and one study
used a half marathon run (Lynn 2015).
The majority of the studies asked the participants to refrain from
strenuous exercise, refrain from taking any form of anti-inflamma-
tory medication or other supplements, and not use any other form
of analgesic activity that would reduce or relieve soreness, such as
an ice bath or massage, for the duration of the study. Participants
were typically excluded if they took any form of supplementation
regularly or had any type of chronic inflammatory condition.
Interventions
In all trials, an antioxidant supplement was compared with a
placebo. A summary of the antioxidant supplement regimens
tested in the individual trials is presented in Table 1.
In all, 13 trials used antioxidants from a whole natural food
source (Bell 2015; Bell 2016; Connolly 2006a; Howatson 2009;
Hutchinson 2016; Kuehl 2010; Lynn 2015; McCormick 2016;
McLeay 2012; O’Connor 2013; Peschek 2014; Trombold 2010;
Trombold 2011), 19 used an antioxidant extract or mixed an-
tioxidants (Arent 2010; Bailey 2011; Bloomer 2005; Cobley
2011; Drobnic 2014; Goldfarb 2011; Herrlinger 2015; Kerksick
2009; Krotkiewski 1994; Laupheimer 2014; McFarlin 2016;
Meamarbashi 2011; Michailidis 2013; Nicol 2015; O’Fallon
2012; Phillips 2003; Silva 2008; Su 2008; Tanabe 2015), and
18 provided either vitamin C or vitamin E or both together
(Avery 2003; Beaton 2002a; Bloomer 2004; Bloomer 2007; Bryer
2006; Close 2006; Connolly 2006; He 2015; Kaminski 1992;
McBride 1997; Nie 2004; Shafat 2004; Silva 2010; Theodorou
2011; Thompson 2001; Thompson 2001a; Thompson 2003;
Thompson 2004). All studies used a placebo either as a powder,
capsule or drink; however, three studies did not provide details
of what the placebo comprised (Arent 2010; McBride 1997; Nie
2004).
No trials compared high-dose versus low-dose antioxidant supple-
ments, where the low-dose supplementation is within normal or
recommended levels for the antioxidant involved.

• Vitamin E (n = 57) (Avery 2003, n =18; McBride 1997, n =

There was a large variation across the studies regarding the dura-
tion of supplementation: the shortest period was under one day
(Tanabe 2015; Thompson 2001) and the longest period was 91
days (Herrlinger 2015). Although the form of supplement was var-
ied, including capsules, powders and drinks, every study used an
antioxidant dosage higher than the recommended daily amount.
Every study required the participant to ingest the supplement
orally either once daily or up to three times per day.
Supplementation was taken before, the day of and after exercise for
up to several days in all the studies except for three studies where
supplements were post-exercise only (Michailidis 2013; Peschek
2014; Thompson 2003).
Outcomes
Primary outcomes
Muscle pain
All 50 trials included muscle soreness as an outcome measure,
the recording of which was an inclusion criterion of this review.
Details of the measurement of muscle soreness in the individual
trials are presented in Table 2.
Thirty-three trials measured muscle soreness using a 0 to 10 cm (or
0 to 100 mm) visual analogue scale (VAS). Of the 17 other trials,
seven measured soreness using a 1 to 10 cm scale (Bailey 2011;
Bryer 2006; Goldfarb 2011; Kaminski 1992; Michailidis 2013;
Thompson 2001; Thompson 2003); four trials used the 0 to 20
cm (or 0 to 200 mm) scale (Bell 2015; Bell 2016; Howatson 2009;
Lynn 2015); two studies (He 2015; Meamarbashi 2011) used a
0- to 6-point scale, Herrlinger 2015 used a 0 to 7 Likert scale,
Drobnic 2014 used a 0- to 4-point scale; Cobley 2011 used a 0 to
12 cm scale and Su 2008 used the Borg CR-10 scale (Borg 1998).
The Borg CR-10 scale ranges from 0 (no soreness) to 10 (maximal
soreness). In the included studies, participants were asked to rate
a muscle soreness on the soreness scales by either carrying out a
squat using body weight, self palpitation of muscle or based on
muscle soreness at rest.
There was considerable variation on the timing of the soreness
measurement after the damaging exercise occurred. Whilst all the
trials measured soreness at baseline, 18 studies measured muscle
soreness immediately after exercise, two studies measured sore-
ness two hours after exercise (Trombold 2010; Trombold 2011),
and one study measured soreness six hours after exercise (Kerksick
2009). Due to this variation, we grouped these studies into the ’up
to 6 hours post-exercise’ category. In addition to measuring sore-
ness immediately after exercise, a few trials also measured soreness
2, 4, 6 or 10 hours post-exercise although the earliest follow-up
time point to immediately post-exercise was used. Forty-one trials
measured muscle soreness at 24 hours, 45 trials at 48 hours, 28
trials at 72 hours and 17 trials at 96 hours post-exercise. Only six
trials measured muscle soreness subsequently: four trials measured
soreness at 120 hours post-exercise (Krotkiewski 1994; Michailidis
2013; O’Fallon 2012; Theodorou 2011), one study at 144 hours
(Michailidis 2013), and three studies at 168 hours after exercise
(Michailidis 2013; Phillips 2003; Silva 2008).

 Subjective recovery
None of the 50 included trials measured the primary outcome of
subjective recovery.
Adverse effects
Only nine studies reported information on adverse effects, seven of
which reported no adverse effects of antioxidant supplementation
(Kerksick 2009; Laupheimer 2014; Lynn 2015; McLeay 2012;
Michailidis 2013; O’Connor 2013; Phillips 2003), and two which
reported specific adverse effects (Cobley 2011; Kuehl 2010). The
remaining 41 studies failed to report adverse effects.
Secondary outcomes
Muscle tenderness
Muscle tenderness (or pressure pain threshold, PPT) was mea-
sured in four trials using a handheld algometer where the cylin-
drical metal probe was placed on the belly of the muscle and the
investigator applied pressure gradually to the point where the par-
ticipant felt discomfort (Close 2006; Connolly 2006; Connolly
2006a; Peschek 2014).
Performance variables
Performance variableswere measuredinfive trials: Arent2010 used
the 30-second Wingate to measure power output in Watts per kg
of body weight (W/kg); Bell2015 measured cycling efficiency; Bell
2016 used a battery of tests including the 20 m sprint, 505 Agility
test and counter-movement jump; Cobley 2011 used the 20 m
sprint and Yo-Yo test; and O’Connor 2013 examined the effects of
antioxidant supplementation on maximal oxygen consumption.
Muscle force
Muscle force production was measured in 30 trials using a dy-
namometer or an isokinetic dynamometer in the muscle where
damage was caused (Bailey 2011; Beaton 2002a; Bell 2015; Bell
2016; Bloomer 2004; Bloomer 2005; Bloomer 2007; Bryer 2006;
Close 2006; Cobley 2011; Connolly 2006; Connolly 2006a;
Goldfarb 2011; Herrlinger 2015; Howatson 2009; Kerksick
2009; McLeay 2012; Meamarbashi 2011; Michailidis 2013;
O’Connor 2013; O’Fallon 2012; Peschek 2014; Shafat 2004;
Tanabe 2015; Theodorou 2011; Thompson 2001; Thompson
2001a; Thompson 2003; Trombold 2010; Trombold 2011). The
main variable measured in these trials was peak isometric force.
Range of motion
Range of motion was assessed in 13 trials using a goniometer
and units were reported in degrees (Bailey 2011; Beaton 2002a;
Bloomer 2004; Bryer 2006; Connolly 2006; Goldfarb 2011;
Howatson 2009; McLeay 2012; Meamarbashi 2011; O’Connor
2013; O’Fallon 2012; Tanabe 2015; Theodorou 2011). Flexion
range was determined either in the elbow or the knee by using uni-
versal landmarks to ensure consistency on subsequent measures.
Excluded studies
We excluded 77 studies, 73 because delayed onset muscle soreness
was not measured (Characteristics of excluded studies). One study
was excluded because the supplement used is not classed as an
antioxidant (Kingsley 2006). We excluded one study because the
antioxidant supplement was co-ingested with a fish oil supplement
and therefore the effect of antioxidant-only supplementation was
not examined (Lenn 2002). We excluded one study because the
antioxidant was combined with a protein supplement (Romano-
Ely 2006), and we excluded one study because antioxidants were
combinedwith ibuprofen, coldwaterimmersionand wheyprotein
at the same time (Al-Nawaiseh 2016).

Allocation
Random sequence generation
We judged 30 studies, all of which gave details of random sequence
generation, at low risk of bias. We rated 15 studies at unclear risk
of bias because they did not specify how the random sequence
was generated and attempts obtain clarification from authors were
unsuccessful. Clarification received from the authors of Tanabe
2015 did not confirm effective random sequence generation and
so we judged this at unclear risk of bias too.
Four studies were at high risk of bias (Howatson 2009; Kerksick
2009; Su 2008; Theodorou 2011). Howatson 2009 matched
on sex and predicted finishing time. Participants were matched
in clusters according to age and body weight for assignment in
Kerksick 2009. Su 2008 randomly assigned participants into an
allicin or control group according to sex and sports participation
and in Theodorou 2011, participants were allocated based on age,
body mass index (BMI) and maximum isometric torque into equal
groups then a computer generator was used for the assignment
into groups.
Concealment of treatment allocation
We deemed that 20 studies had a low risk of bias because al-
location concealment was very likely (Bailey 2011; Bell 2015;
Bell 2016; Bloomer 2004; Bloomer 2005; Bloomer 2007; Close
2006; Cobley 2011; He 2015; Herrlinger 2015; Kerksick 2009;
Laupheimer 2014; McCormick 2016; Meamarbashi 2011; Nicol
2015; O’Connor 2013; Peschek 2014; Silva 2008; Silva 2010;
Theodorou 2011). We rated 23 studies at unclear risk as there were
no details specified in the manuscripts and authors did not respond
to our request for clarification. The authors of a further six studies
responded to our query but their response was unclear thus they
were assessed also at unclear risk of bias (Drobnic 2014; Howatson
2009; Lynn 2015; Nie 2004; Shafat 2004; Tanabe 2015). We con-
sidered McLeay 2012 at high risk of bias because safeguards to en-
sure allocation concealment were absent and the treatment for the
second stage of this cross-over trial would have been predictable.
Blinding
Overall, 36 studies were double-blind or blinding was reported
and therefore we assessed them at low risk of performance and
detection bias.
We assessed eight studies at high risk of performance bias because
of the lack of blinding of personnel (Drobnic 2014; Howatson
2009; Lynn 2015; McLeay 2012; Peschek2014; Shafat 2004; Silva
2008; Tanabe 2015). We rated five studies at unclear risk of per-
formance bias as there were no details specified in the trial reports
and the authors did not respond to our request for clarification
(Bryer 2006; Connolly 2006a; Herrlinger 2015; McBride 1997;
19
Antioxidants for preventing and reducing muscle soreness after exercise (Review)
Copyright © 2017 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
 Su 2008). We assessed only one study at high risk of detection bias,
with a clear possibility of a lack of participant blinding (McLeay
2012). Of the nine six studies assessed at unclear risk of detec-
tion bias, six provided no details of whether there was blinding
(Bryer 2006; Connolly 2006a; Herrlinger 2015; McBride 1997;
Su 2008; Tanabe 2015), and there were reasons for some doubts
aboutwhetherblindingwasassuredinthree others(Drobnic 2014;
Lynn 2015; Shafat 2004).
Incomplete outcome data
We judged 38 studies at low risk of attrition bias. We assessed one
study at unclear risk of attrition bias since there were no details
on participant flow and the authors did not reply to our request
for data (Krotkiewski 1994). We rated 11 studies at high risk of
attrition bias as dropouts ranged between 12.5% to 50% either
overall or in a trial arm (Arent 2010; Bloomer 2007; Connolly
2006a; Hutchinson 2016; Kaminski 1992; Lynn 2015; McFarlin
2016; Michailidis 2013; Phillips 2003; Silva 2008; Silva 2010).
In Arent 2010, out of the six participants who dropped out, five
withdrew of their own volition due to the inability to tolerate the
physical demands of the testing protocol. Six participants did not
complete all aspects of the study for personal reasons in Bloomer
2007. Two participants withdrew from another cross-over study
for personal reasons (Connolly 2006a). In Hutchinson 2016, eight
participants withdrew due to illness and injury unrelated to the
study protocol. In Kaminski 1992, six participants withdrew for
a variety of reasons (loss of capsule integrity, failure to properly
maintain records, non-compliance with the experimental proto-
col), and one was removed for failure to develop DOMS in either
stage of the cross-over trial. In Lynn 2015, data were missing from
two participants of the intervention group; however, as this was
a cross-over trial, attrition was balanced across groups. McFarlin
2016 had a 30% attrition/non-compliance rate, probably with an
unevendropoutrate betweenthe twogroups. One cross-overstudy
stated in a published protocol that 20 individuals were enrolled
and 12 completed although the manuscript stated that 10 males
completed the study (Michailidis 2013). Phillips 2003 excluded
five participants due to complications with blood-drawing proce-
dures; however, it is unclear which group they were from. Four
participants withdrew from Silva 2008 and six participants from
Silva 2010 for personal reasons not associated with the exercise or
the supplementation; it was not specified to which group the loses
applied in either study.
Selective reporting
Three studies were registered with ClinicalTrials.gov and as all the
outcomeswere reportedinthe publishedstudieswe initiallyjudged
these at low risk of selective reporting (Kuehl 2010; Michailidis
2013; Theodorou 2011). However, Theodorou 2011 did not
record adverse effects and we thus judged it at unclear risk of
bias. We also judged all nine studies that reported on adverse ef-
fects from antioxidant supplementation, as well as fully report-
ing outcomes listed in their methods sections, at low risk of se-
lective reporting bias (Cobley 2011; Kerksick 2009; Kuehl 2010;
Laupheimer 2014; Lynn 2015; McLeay 2012; Michailidis 2013;
O’Connor 2013; Phillips 2003). We rated the remaining 40 stud-
ies at high risk of selective reporting. As well as the lack of report-
ing of adverse effects, this reflected the lack of response from the
authors of 16 studies to requests for mean and standard deviation
data. Three studies rated at high risk of selective reporting bias be-
cause of other deficiencies in reporting were Bell 2015, Bell 2016
and Thompson 2003: the first two studies did not report muscle
soreness data immediately post-exercise and Thompson 2003 did
not report data for all the time points.
Other potential sources of bias
We deemed 16 studies at unclear risk of other potential sources
of bias such as dietary control or avoiding medication or supple-
ments that could reduce muscle soreness. Of these, we judged
seven studies at unclear risk of other bias because no details re-
garding dietary control or instructing participants to avoid non-
steroidal anti-inflammatorydrugs(NSAIDs)orothersupplements
were provided in the trial report (Bailey 2011; Bloomer 2005;
McBride 1997; Nicol 2015; Shafat 2004; Silva 2008; Silva 2010).
The nine other studies controlled the participants’ diets but pro-
vided no details regarding dietary control or instructing partici-
pants to avoid NSAIDs or other supplements and we therefore
judged them at unclear risk of bias (Bell 2016; Krotkiewski 1994;
McCormick 2016; McLeay 2012; Michailidis 2013; Nie 2004;
Theodorou 2011; Thompson 2001; Thompson 2004). We rated
34 studies at low risk of other bias as diet, intake of supplements
and medication were controlled.
Effects of interventions
See: Summary of findings for the main comparison Summary
of findings: antioxidants versus placebo
Evidence from the 50 trials included in this review applied to
only one comparison: antioxidant supplements versus control
(placebo).
Antioxidant supplementation versus placebo or no
supplementation
All 50 included studies made this comparison. Muscle soreness
data were not available for pooling from one trial (Herrlinger
2015), and no data were pooled from McCormick 2016 because
of its protracted exercise regimen.
Primary outcomes

Antioxidants for preventing and reducing muscle soreness after exercise (Review)
Copyright © 2017 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
 Delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS) (visual analogue
scale, various scales or scores; highest values = worst pain)
Forty-eight studies presented data on muscle soreness at various
different time points based on various visual analogue scale (VAS)
scores. Results are presented at eight follow-up times after exercise:
up to 6 hours, and at 24, 48, 73, 96, 120, 144 and 168 hours. As
there was considerable clinical heterogeneity we used the random-
effects model. Both Kerksick 2009 and Silva 2008 tested two an-
tioxidants: in the analyses, Kerksick 2009 appears twice for the
first four follow-up times and Silva 2008 appears twice at 48, 96
and 168 hours.
Antioxidant supplementation reduced muscle soreness in compar-
ison with placebo intervention when measured up to 6 hours post-
exercise (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.30, 95% confi-
dence interval (CI) -0.56 to -0.04; participants = 525; studies =
21; I2 = 53%; low-quality evidence); Analysis 1.1); at 24 hours
after exercise (SMD -0.13, 95% CI -0.27 to 0.00; participants =
936; studies = 41; I2 = 5%; moderate-quality evidence; Analysis
1.2; Figure 4); at 48 hours after exercise (SMD -0.24, 95% CI -
0.42 to -0.07; participants = 1047; studies = 45; I2 = 47%; low-
quality evidence; Analysis 1.3; Figure 5) and at 72 hours after ex-
ercise (SMD -0.19, 95% CI -0.38 to -0.00; participants = 657;
studies = 28; I2 = 27%; moderate-quality evidence; Analysis 1.4).
(It is notable that the heterogeneity in this analysis is solely related
to the inclusion of Michailidis 2013). There was little effect of
antioxidants on muscle soreness at 96 hours after exercise (SMD
-0.05, 95% CI -0.29 to 0.19; participants = 436; studies = 17; I
2 = 31%; low-quality evidence; Analysis 1.5). Far fewer trials pro-
vided data at five days or subsequently. There was very low-qual-
ity evidence of little effect of antioxidants on muscle soreness at
120 hours (SMD 0.21, 95% CI -0.26 to 0.69; participants = 128;
studies = 4; I2 = 39%), at 144 hours (SMD -0.23, 95% CI -1.11
to 0.65; participants = 20; studies = 1) or at 168 hours (SMD -
0.04, 95% CI -0.48 to 0.41; participants = 80; studies = 4; I2 =
0%); Analysis 1.6).

 As there was considerable variation in the units used to measured
muscle soreness, we rescaled all trials to the 0 to 10 scale at the first
five time points in order to explore the actual difference between
groups on a standard scale. The results are as follows: up to 6 hours
(mean difference (MD) -0.52, 95% CI -0.95 to -0.08; participants
= 525; studies = 21; I2 = 66%; Analysis 1.7); at 24 hours (MD -
0.17, 95% CI -0.42 to 0.07; participants = 936; studies = 41; I2
= 29%; Analysis 1.8); at 48 hours (MD -0.41, 95% CI -0.69 to -
0.12; participants = 1047; studies = 45; I2 = 64%; Analysis 1.9); at
72 hours (MD -0.29, 95% CI -0.59 to 0.02; participants = 657;
studies = 28; I2 = 27%; Analysis 1.10); and at 96 hours (MD -0.03,
95% CI -0.43 to 0.37; participants = 436; studies = 17; I2 = 51%;
Analysis1.11). Thisrescalingalsoallowsustoexamine whetherthe
antioxidantsupplementproducesaclinicallyimportantdifference.
For consistency with Bleakley 2012, we considered 1.4 cm as the
minimal important difference (MID) for pain reduction on a 10
cm visual analogue scale; this was based on an estimated MID
for musculoskeletal conditions of the shoulder by Tashjian 2009.
It is notable that all of the upper limits of the 95% CIs of these
five analyses are lower that this MID and hence all quantitative
differences do not appear to represent person-relevant differences
in muscle soreness.
Subgroup and sensitivity analyses
We performed only a few subgroup and sensitivity analyses. We
selected the 24 and 48 hours analyses for subgroup analyses given
that these were the categories with the largest number of trials. We
did not use the up to 6 hours time period because of the variation
in the timing of measurement: i.e. some studies measured this out-
come immediately after exercise whereas other studies measured
this up to 2 hours or up to 6 hours after exercise.
A sensitivity analysis exploring the use of the fixed-effect model
for all eight follow-up times produced similar results to that of
random-effects model (Table 3; analysis not shown).
A subgroup analysis could not be performed on timing of ad-
ministration (i.e. pre-exercise and post-exercise versus post-exer-
cise only) because there were very few trials (one or two studies
depending on the time of follow-up) in the post-exercise group.
We performed a subgroup analysis on the type of exercise, that is,
mechanically induced versus whole body aerobic exercise for the
24 and 48 hour follow-up times (see Analysis 1.12; Analysis 1.13).
There is no evidence of subgroup differences for muscle soreness
for type of exercise at 24 hours (Chi² = 0.44, df = 1; P = 0.51, I²
= 0%) or at 48 hours (Chi² = 0.88, df = 1; P = 0.35, I² = 0%).
Our second subgroup analysis was based on source of funding
where we compared studies that were funded by a food company
or provider of antioxidant supplements versus studies that there
were not (see Analysis 1.14; Analysis 1.15). There is no evidence
of subgroup differences for muscle soreness according to source of
funding at 24 hours (Chi² = 0.03, df = 1, P = 0.87, I² = 0%) or 48
hours (Chi² = 0.10, df = 1, P = 0.875 I² = 0%); no information
on funding was available for Su 2008.
We conducted a sensitivity analysis testing trials at unclear risk
of bias, relating to random sequence generation, allocation con-
cealment or both, which included 19 trials (Bailey 2011; Bell
2015; Bell 2016; Bloomer 2004; Bloomer 2005; Bloomer 2007;
Close 2006; Cobley 2011; He 2015; Herrlinger 2015; Howatson
2009; Laupheimer 2014; McCormick 2016; Meamarbashi 2011;
O’Connor 2013; Peschek 2014; Silva 2008; Silva 2010; Tanabe
2015). This analysis made little difference to the overall effect at
either 24 hours post-exercise (SMD -0.10, 95% CI -0.37 to 0.17;
participants = 280; studies = 14; I2 = 19%) or at 48 hours (SMD
-0.31, 95% CI -0.66 to 0.04; participants = 327; studies = 16; I2
= 57%).
Also presented are sensitivity analyses testing the effects of exclud-
ing cross-over studies; these provide reassurance that the inclusion
of such trials did not have an important effect on the results (Table
4).
Subjective recovery
No study measured subjective recovery (return to previous activi-
ties without signs or symptoms).
Adverse effects
Nine studies, reporting on a total of 216 participants, reported on
this outcome (very low-quality evidence). One study reported that
all sixparticipantsinthe NAC(N-acetylcysteine)supplementation
grouphaddiarrhoea,which wasmildinfive participantsand severe
diarrhoea in one (Cobley 2011). The same study reported mild
indigestion in four participants (67%) in the NAC group and one
of six participants in the placebo group. Another study reported
that tart cherry juice caused mild gastrointestinal distress in one of
26 participants taking the antioxidant supplement (Kuehl 2010).
Seven studies reported no adverse effects of taking the antioxidant
supplementation (Kerksick 2009; Laupheimer 2014; Lynn 2015;
McLeay 2012; Michailidis 2013; O’Connor 2013; Phillips 2003).
The remaining 41 studies failed to report adverse effects.
Secondary outcomes
Muscle tenderness
Only four studies measured muscle tenderness using a handheld
algometer (Close 2006; Connolly 2006; Connolly 2006a; Peschek
2014) (and Analysis 1.17). Two studies measured tenderness using
pressure algometry and reported the results in Newtons (Connolly
2006; Connolly 2006a), and two studies measured tenderness and
reported in kg (Close 2006; Peschek 2014). There was very low-
quality evidence of little difference between antioxidant supple-
mentation versus placebo in tenderness (a greater pressure exerted
means less tenderness) at the four time points (24, 48, 72 and
96 hours) for the pooled data from the two studies (52 partici-
pants) reporting the results in Newtons (Analysis 1.16); nor for
five time points (up to 6 hours, 24, 48, 72 and 96 hours) for the
24

 data from the two studies (36 participants) reporting the results
in kg (Analysis 1.17).
Performance variables
The quality of the evidence for all performance variables was very
low; each variable presented here being reported by only one of
the five studies reporting these outcomes (Arent 2010; Bell 2015;
Bell 2016; Cobley 2011; O’Connor 2013). Arent 2010 (18 partic-
ipants; cross-over trial) found no effect of antioxidant supplemen-
tation on the 30-second Wingate performed on a cycle ergome-
ter (the DOMS-provoking exercise) seven days after supplemen-
tation (MD 0.30 W/kg, 95% CI -2.74 to 3.34; Analysis 1.18).
Cobley 2011 (12 participants) found antioxidant supplementa-
tion (NAC) enhanced sprint time over 20 metres at three follow-
up times (lower values = better performance): 24 hours (MD -0.41
seconds, 95% CI -0.63 to -0.19), 48 hours (MD -0.30 seconds,
95% CI -0.52 to -0.08) and 120 hours (MD -0.30, 95% CI -
0.54 to -0.06; Analysis 1.19). O’Connor 2013 (40 participants)
found no improvements in maximal oxygen consumption when
measured after 42 days after antioxidant supplementation (higher
values = better performance) (MD 0.20 mL/kg/min, 95% CI -
5.66 to 6.06; Analysis 1.20). Bell 2016 (16 participants) found
no effect of antioxidant supplementation on agility (5-0-5 agility:
lower values = better performance) at any of the three time points
measured: 24 hours (MD 0.01 seconds, 95% CI -0.16 to 0.18),
48 hours (MD -0.05 seconds, 95% CI -0.19 to 0.09) or 72 hours
(MD -0.02 seconds, 95% CI -0.17 to 0.13) (Analysis 1.21). Bell
2015 (16 participants) found no effect of antioxidant supplemen-
tation on six-second sprint power (higher values = better perfor-
mance) at any of the three time points measured: 24 hours (MD
39.00 W, 95% CI -182.33 to 260.33), 48 hours (MD 50.00 W,
95% CI -195.44 to 295.44) or 72 hours (MD 53.00 W, 95% CI
-174.56 to 280.56) (Analysis 1.22).
Muscle force production (maximal voluntary contraction)
Thirty studies measured muscle function at various different time
points. Muscle force production was measured in different ways
and we pooled results only from studies using the same outcome
measure: 15 trials reported the percentage change in force produc-
tion from baseline; six reported Newton metres, six reported New-
tons, two reported Newton metres per kg of body mass and one re-
ported kg. We rated the quality of evidence as very low for all find-
ings. When muscle force production was measured as a percentage
change from baseline, antioxidant supplementation appeared to
increase force production to a small extent (all under 6%) in com-
parison with placebo across the first five time points: up to 6 hours
after exercise (MD 5.86%, 95% CI 3.29 to 8.42; participants =
255; studies = 11; I2 = 3%), at 24 hours (MD 2.51%, 95% CI 0.99
to 4.04; participants = 375; studies = 15; I2 = 75%), at 48 hours
(MD 4.46%, 95% CI 2.94 to 5.98; participants = 375; studies =
15; I2 = 59%), at 72 hours (MD 3.92%, 95% CI 0.88 to 6.96;
participants = 277; studies = 11; I2 = 51%), and at 96 hours after
exercise (MD 5.29, 95% CI 3.65 to 6.92; participants = 252; stud-
ies = 9; I2 = 72%) (Analysis 1.23). (Although in the results for 168
hours after exercise, the antioxidant showed a harmful effect on
muscle force production, only two studies measured this outcome
at this time point and the results were statistically heterogeneous
(MD -7.96, 95% CI -15.96 to 0.05; participants = 36; studies =
2; I2 = 68%). Where data were pooled, for up to six studies for
force production measured in Newton metres, or for up to five
studies for force production measured in Newtons, there were no
differences found between the antioxidant supplementation and
placebo groups across all of the time points measured (see Analysis
1.24 and Analysis 1.25). For completeness, the non-pooled results
for the two trials reporting the strength in Newton metres per kg
of body mass are shown in Analysis 1.26 and those for the trial
reporting strength in kg in Analysis 1.27. The former are domi-
nated by those of Michailidis 2013, which favour antioxidants in
the first five follow-ups but placebo in the last two follow-ups.
Range of motion
There was very low-quality evidence that range of motion,
which was measured in 10 studies (Bailey 2011; Bloomer 2004;
Bryer 2006 Connolly 2006a; Goldfarb 2011; Meamarbashi 2011;
O’Connor 2013; Phillips 2003; Tanabe 2015; Theodorou 2011),
did not differ importantly between the two groups (antioxidant
versus placebo) at any of the follow-up times (see Analysis 1.28).
All differences (higher values = better range of motion) were small
and unlikely to relate to a clinically important difference at either
the elbow or knee. The first five follow-up time results are pre-
sented here: up to 6 hours after exercise (MD -0.25 degrees, 95%
CI -3.31 to 2.81; participants = 163; studies = 6; I2 = 0%), at 24
hours (MD 1.03 degrees, 95% CI -0.91 to 2.96; participants =
259; studies = 9; I2 = 0%), at 48 hours (MD 2.71 degrees, 95%
CI 0.39 to 5.04; participants = 259; studies = 9; I2 = 61%), at
72 hours (MD 2.93 degrees, 95% CI -0.02 to 5.87; participants
= 196; studies = 7; I2 = 0%) and at 96 hours (MD 0.79 degrees,
95% CI -1.26 to 2.84; participants = 158; studies = 6; I2 = 0%).
High-dose versus low-dose, where the low-dose
supplementation is within normal or recommended
levels for the antioxidant involved

Summary of main results
This review examined the effectiveness of antioxidants for prevent-
ing and treating muscle soreness after exercise. Fifty randomised
placebo-controlledstudieswere included,12of which useda cross-
over design. The 50 studies involved a total of 1089 participants
25
Antioxidants for preventing and reducing muscle soreness after exercise (Review)
Copyright © 2017 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
 (961 male; 128 female; age range 16 to 55 years). The studies
were heterogeneous, including the timing (pre-exercise or post-
exercise), frequency, dose or duration, and type of antioxidant
supplementation, and the type of preceding delayed onset mus-
cle soreness (DOMS)-producing exercise. All studies used an an-
tioxidant dosage higher than the recommended daily amount. No
studies compared high-dose versus low-dose, where the low-dose
supplementation was within normal or recommended levels for
the antioxidant involved.
The included studies made only one comparison: antioxidant sup-
plements versus control (placebo). Our main outcomes were mus-
cle soreness (up to 6 hours post-exercise and at 24, 48, 72 and 96
hours), subjective recovery and adverse events.
Antioxidant supplementation versus placebo or no
supplementation
A summary of the evidence available for the main outcomes for
this comparison is presented in Summary of findings for the main
comparison. The assessment of the quality of the evidence varied
between moderate quality, where the effect is probably true but
there is a possibility that it could be substantially different, low
quality, where the effect may be true but it may also be substantially
different from what was found, and very low quality, where we are
very uncertain about the estimate.
Pooled standardised mean difference (SMD) results for muscle
soreness indicated a small difference in favour of antioxidant sup-
plementation after DOMS-inducing exercise at all main follow-
ups: up to 6 hours (525 participants; 21 studies; low-quality evi-
dence); at 24 hours (936 participants; 41 studies; moderate-qual-
ity evidence), at 48 hours (1047 participants; 45 studies; low-qual-
ity evidence); at 72 hours (657 participants; 28 studies; moder-
ate-quality evidence), and little difference at 96 hours (436 par-
ticipants; 17 studies; low-quality evidence). When, however, we
rescaled all the trial results to the 0 to 10 cm scale in order to com-
pare the actual difference between groups, we found that the 95%
confidence intervals(CIs)forall five follow-uptimeswere all below
1.0 cm, and thus all below the minimal important difference of
1.4 cm that we used in this review. Thus, all statistical differences
in DOMS favouring antioxidant supplementation were unlikely
to equate to meaningful or important differences in practice. Nei-
ther of our subgroup analyses to examine for differences in effect
according to type of DOMS-inducing exercise (mechanical versus
whole body aerobic) or according to funding source confirmed
subgroup differences. Sensitivity analyses to test the selection of
the statistical model for pooling (fixed-effect instead of random-
effects) and the exclusion of cross-over studies all showed similar
results to the main analyses.
None of the 50 studies reported on subjective recovery (return to
previous activities without signs or symptoms).
Only nine studies (216 participants) reported on adverse effects,
with actual events reported in two studies. One study (12 partic-
ipants) reported that all six participants in the NAC (N-acetyl-
cysteine) supplementation group had diarrhoea, which was mild
in five participants and severe in one (Cobley 2011). The same
study reported mild indigestion in four participants (67%) in the
NAC group and one of six participants in the placebo group. It
should be noted that NAC supplementation is usually prescribed
and it has been found to cause uncomfortable side effects includ-
ing nausea and diarrhoea in other studies. Another study reported
that tart cherry juice caused mild gastrointestinal distress in one of
26 participants taking the antioxidant supplement (Kuehl 2010).
The other seven studies reported no adverse effects of taking the
antioxidant supplementation; this included 10 participants hav-
ing NAC supplementation in one study. Overall, the available ev-
idence for adverse events is very low-quality.
Overall completeness and applicability of
evidence
Data for muscle soreness, the primary outcome, were available
from 48 of the 50 small placebo-controlled randomised trials, with
pooled data available at 24 hours after the exercise from 41 trials
(one of which tested two antioxidants), involving 936 participants
and from 45 (two of which tested two antioxidants), involving
1047 participants. In contrast there were no data for subjective
recovery and few data for adverse effects.
We consider the applicability of the evidence in terms of the pop-
ulation characteristics, the exercise used to induce muscle damage
and trial settings, the antioxidants used and outcomes. In partic-
ular, the 50 trials included in this review varied regarding dosages
of antioxidants, the muscle damage model and adequate control
of extraneous variables.
The majority of the 1089 participants included in this review were
male (961; 88.2%) and so arguably the findings of the review are
mainly applicable to males but there is no biological basis for why
antioxidants should have a different effect in the two sexes. These
sex differences are typical of what is observed in the athletic re-
covery literature (Bieuzen 2013; Bleakley 2012; Costello 2014).
More noteworthy is that no data from highly-trained elite athletes
were included in the analyses; the data pertaining to nine elite ath-
letes tested in McCormick 2016 were not included in the meta-
analyses because the exercise paradigm was completely different
to all the other studies included in this review. As the majority
of the participants were either college students or relatively young
and active, these findings cannot be generalised in the elite athlete
population who have a different physiological and training status.
Some reservations in terms of applicability also apply to older in-
dividuals due to their anatomical and physiological characteristics
as there were no older participants included in this review (age
range of participants: 16 to 55 years).
There were large variations regarding the mode of exercise used
to induce muscle damage in the studies, with some studies us-
ing exhaustive high-intensity exercise such as downhill running
26
Antioxidants for preventing and reducing muscle soreness after exercise (Review)

 (i.e. whole body aerobic exercise) and other studies using a resis-
tance training protocol (i.e. mechanically induced exercise). Thus
the level of muscle damage experienced by the participants will
have varied. In addition, the intensity of the exercise used to illicit
muscle damage also varied greatly amongst studies: some studies
used an extremely demanding and intense exercise protocol such
as 10 sets of 10 repetitions knee extensions performed at 80% of
one repetition maximum or a marathon run, whereas others used
less exhaustive protocols such as a bench stepping exercise. The
amount of muscle damage and oxidative stress caused depends on
the type, intensity and duration of physical exercise performed
(Castrogiovanni 2012). Paulsen 2012 found exercise that has a
greater eccentric component that involves a greater range of mo-
tion and high force generation is more likely to cause greater levels
of damage. Moreover, Bleakley 2012 reported that resistance ex-
ercises performed under laboratory conditions are associated with
high levels of muscle damage and soreness, particularly in the un-
trained population. Our subgroup analysis that compared type of
exercise at 24 and 48 hours did not show subgroup differences
between whole body aerobic exercise and mechanically induced
exercise. Despite the variation, the key point for this review is that
the exercise protocols, whether in the laboratory or field setting,
were all sufficient to induce muscle damage that would result in
DOMS in people undergoing sport activities.
There was large variation in the dose and duration of the antioxi-
dants used, with three trials testing supplements started only after
exercise. The variation was too great to enable meaningful indi-
rect comparisons (subgroup analyses) and no trial compared high-
versus low-dose supplementation, where the low-dose supplemen-
tation was within normal or recommended levels for the antioxi-
dant involved. Nonetheless, all studies used an antioxidant dosage
higher than the recommended daily amount.
The timing for assessment of muscle soreness, with the majority
of evidence available for 24 and 48 hours after exercise, was ap-
propriate. However, the timing of measurement for up to 6 hours
varied greatly amongst the studies where some studies measured
muscle soreness immediately after exercise and some studies mea-
sured this several hours after exercise. There was considerable vari-
ation in the measurement of muscle soreness, which meant that we
pooled SMDs for the main analyses. Exploratory analyses, where
all results were on a 10 cm scale, allowed an assessment of whether
the between-group differences were clinically relevant. Crucially,
the upper limits of the 95% CIs at all five time points were much
less than a typical minimal important difference (MID) for pain.
Quality of the evidence
We assessed the quality of evidence using the GRADE framework,
which
com-
bines considerations of risk of bias,indirectness,inconsistency (het-
erogeneity),imprecision and publication bias. The findings for the
main outcomes are shown in Summary of findings for the main
comparison. We downgraded all outcomes one level for serious
risk of bias, due mainly to selective reporting bias (the majority of
the trials failed to report on adverse effects) and, to a lesser degree,
attrition biases. We did not downgrade for indirectness in relation
to muscle soreness. We downgraded two outcomes for serious in-
consistency reflecting heterogeneity that could not be traced to
the inclusion of just one outlier trial. Pooled evidence did not sup-
port downgrading for imprecision. Our tests for publication bias
did not reveal a serious concern (Figure 6; Figure 7), although all
were small studies. Thus, we did not downgrade for publication
bias. We concluded that the quality of the evidence ranged from
moderate to very low.

Potential biases in the review process
We used the standard methods described in the Cochrane Hand-
book for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Higgins 2011). Al-
though our search was extensive, we cannot exclude the possibility
that we have missed relevant evidence. For studies where we re-
quired the raw data, we contacted authors via email. The authors of
14 studies did not respond to several emails requesting mean and
standard deviation data (Avery 2003; Beaton 2002a; Bryer 2006;
Connolly 2006; Connolly 2006a; Goldfarb 2011; Krotkiewski
1994; McFarlin 2016; Michailidis 2013; Peschek 2014; Phillips
2003; Su 2008; Trombold 2010; Trombold 2011). We therefore
extracted these data from graphs using Graphclick 2010 Arizona
(version 3.0.2, 2010). Whilst this is not ideal, we tried to minimise
error by having two review authors (MR and DR) independently
extract the data, with any discrepancies resolved by consultation
with the third and fourth authors (HS and JC).
One potential source of bias is the post-hoc exclusion of trials not
reporting our primary outcomes (see Types of outcome measures).
However, none of the excluded studies were aimed at the preven-
tion, reduction or treatment of DOMS.
We set out “to assess the effects (benefits and harms) of antioxi-
dant supplements and antioxidant-enriched foods for preventing
and reducing the severity and duration of delayed onset muscle
soreness following exercise” (Objectives). To achieve this, we de-
cided to pool data from clearly heterogeneous trials; for instance
varying in their study design, populations, the exercise protocols,
the antioxidant dosage, start and length of supplementation, their
accounting for extraneous variables that could affect recovery and
to a lesser degree in their timing of measuring muscle soreness
(DOMS). In the light of this clinical heterogeneity, the statistical
heterogeneity was not extreme and sometimes the heterogeneity
could be sourced to a very few outliers (e.g. Michailidis 2013 for
muscle soreness at 72 hours (Analysis 1.4)). Subgroup analysis by
type of exercise proved reassuring. Keeping the focus on the main
characteristic of the intervention (i.e. oral antioxidant supplemen-
tation at dosage above the recommended daily dosage) appears
justified.
Publication bias is a threat to any systematic review or meta-analy-
sis and publication bias among nutrition-related scientific articles
remains a problem. Lesser 2007 investigated financial sponsorship
of scientificarticlesaddressingthe health effectsof three commonly
consumed beverages to determine how sponsorship affects pub-
lished conclusions and found that industry funding of nutrition-
related studies may bias conclusions in favour of sponsors’ prod-
29

 ucts. However, funnel plots for the outcomes of muscle soreness
at 24 hours and 48 hours were not suggestive of publication bias
(Figure 6; Figure 7). Moreover, we performed a subgroup analy-
sis on studies that were funded by a food company or provider
of antioxidant supplements and compared them with studies that
were not funded by a food company or provider of antioxidant
supplements and we found no evidence of subgroup differences
and thus sponsorship bias (Analysis 1.14; Analysis 1.15).
Our inclusion of cross-over studies and our analysis of their data
as if from a parallel group trial, thus without adjustment for the
cross-over design, are other potential sources of bias. With one
exception, the cross-over studies included in this review used a
washout period of two to six weeks, which is sufficient to allow
the muscles to recover. The exception used a washout period of
only five days between treatments and therefore carries some risk
of a carry-over effect (Arent 2010); sensitivity analysis to check
on the effect of excluding the data from this trial did not result
in important changes. Further sensitivity analyses checking the
effects of excluding the cross-over trials from the muscle soreness
analyses showed that our inclusion and handling of the cross-over
studies did not have an important impact on the review results.
Agreements and disagreements with other
studies or reviews
Several narrative reviews have been written on antioxidant sup-
plementation and recovery (e.g. Gross 2011; Howatson 2008b;
McGinley 2009; Peternelj 2011). However, to our knowledge this
is the first systematic review that has examined the effects of an-
tioxidant supplements for preventing and reducing muscle sore-
ness after exercise. Our review also includes more recently pub-
lished evidence. For example, of the 45 trials contributing evidence
to the 48 hours muscle soreness analysis (Analysis 1.3), 14 were
published in 2012 or subsequently, and 14 more were published
between 2009 and 2011.
The observations by Howatson 2008b on the large variations in
type of, dosage used and duration of antioxidant and exercise
modality are consistent with our findings. McGinley 2009, which
reviewed the effects of vitamin C, vitamin E and both combined
on muscle damage and oxidative stress, also attributed the mixed
findings to variations in dosage, timing and duration of antioxi-
dant and exercise modality. McGinley 2009 suggested that there
was some evidence to show that both vitamin C and vitamin E an-
tioxidants can reduce oxidative stress but there was poor evidence
to show any positive effects on protecting against muscle damage
and soreness. It is also notable that there has been some indica-
tion that long-term antioxidant supplementation in high doses,
in particular vitamin E, may increase mortality (Bjelakovic 2007).
Peternelj2011 concluded that antioxidant supplementation atten-
uates exercise-induced oxidative stress but had no effects on exer-
cise-induced muscle damage, soreness and performance. Although
Peternelj 2011 did not perform a meta-analysis, they suggested
that there is a growing body of evidence indicating that antioxidant
supplements may have a detrimental effect as they may interfere
with the beneficial effects of exercise training. Gross 2011 in their
narrative review on antioxidant supplementation and endurance
training noted that the use of antioxidants in sport by amateur and
professional athletes was common and that some studies had sug-
gested that these may actually be counterproductive (in particular
vitamin C and E supplements) as they may impair and weaken
some of the desired signalling roles played by free radicals during
training adaptations. The latter, however, was not investigated by
Gross 2011. Nonetheless, over the last few years there has been
an emergence of studies showing that chronic antioxidant sup-
plementation may actually be counterproductive, particularly in
interfering with exercise-induced cell-signalling in skeletal mus-
cle thus having an overall detrimental effect of exercise training
on both performance and health (Gomez-Cabrera 2008; Paulsen
2014; Ristow 2009). More specifically, several studies have shown
that antioxidant supplements promote exercise-induced oxidative
stress (Avery 2003; Bailey 2011; Beaton 2002; Childs 2001; Knez
2007; Lamprecht 2009; Malm 1996; Nieman 2004), hinder cell
adaptation to exercise-induced oxidative stress (Gomez-Cabrera
2008; Ristow 2009; Paulsen 2014), and delay healing and recov-
ery from exercise (Close 2006; Teixeira 2009), and long-term an-
tioxidant supplementation in high doses may increase mortality
(Bjelakovic 2014; Slatore 2008).
The risk of adverse effects is likely to be dependent of the type
of antioxidant. One of the two trials in the review reporting on
adverse effects was testing NAC supplementation and reported
that all six participants in the antioxidant group had diarrhoea
(Cobley 2011). As well as being a listed side effect of this prescrip-
tion drug, uncomfortable side effects such as nausea and diarrhoea
from NAC supplementation have also been reported elsewhere
(Ferreira 2011).
As well as random errors relating to small trials and bias, there
are numerous factors that can explain why there are differences
between trials and in the antioxidant literature on whether antiox-
idants are beneficial or not for recovery. The recovery process is
complex, and there are many extraneous variables that could inter-
fere or accelerate the recovery process. Factors such as differences
in antioxidant dosage, length of supplementation, and accounting
for extraneous variables that could affect recovery could explain
differences between trials (Close 2014). Second, there are large
variations in the type of participants with most studies recruiting
untrained, sedentary and relatively young and healthy individu-
als and far fewer studies recruiting well-trained athletes. Partici-
pants will vary in size, body weight, body composition and they
may respond differently to antioxidant supplementation due to
metabolic differences; these may also be some reasons that can
explain the differences in findings. Nonetheless, as argued above,
retaining the focus on the broad question asked in this review
has helped to us to examine and summarise the evidence for the
overall question of whether antioxidants prevent or reduce muscle

 soreness after exercise.

C O N C L U S I O N S
Implications for practice
There is moderate- to low-quality evidence that antioxidant sup-
plementation does not result in a clinically relevant reduction of
muscle soreness after exercise at any of the five follow-up times: up
to 6 hours and at 24, 48, 72 and 96 hours after exercise. There is
no evidence available on subjective recovery and only limited evi-
dence on adverse effects of taking antioxidant supplements. Some
antioxidant supplements such as N-acetylcysteine may cause un-
wanted side effects including gastrointestinal discomfort and di-
arrhoea.
Implications for research
The findings of, and messages from, this review provide an oppor-
tunity for researchers and other stakeholders to come together and
consider what are the priorities, and underlying justifications, for
future research in this area. Should there be a continuing focus on
antioxidants, in preference to other interventions used for reduc-
ing muscle soreness, the area would benefit from standardisation of
methods and antioxidant protocols. Future randomised controlled
trials should ensure that the rationale for the antioxidant protocol
is considered and specified, and attention given to dietary control
and other factors that may affect recovery as these are important
confounders when investigating the impact of antioxidant supple-
mentation on exercise performance and recovery. The rationale for
selection of populations different from those covered in the review
should also be given. We suggest that a case could be made for elite
athletes, not included in this review, as this particular group have
a different physiological and training status. As recently noted,
future studies should employ a parallel design with larger sample
sizes as when investigating muscle recovery cross-over trials may
have a risk regarding carry-over effects between treatment periods
(Bleakley 2012; Costello 2015).

Characteristics of included studies [ordered by study ID]
Arent 2010
Methods
Randomised controlled trial (cross-over design)
Separated by a 5-day washout
Participants
Setting: laboratory; USA
n = 24 college-aged males with at least 1 year of weightlifting experience; mean age 21.
3 (SE 0.4) years
18 participants completed the study; 1 participant dropped out due to training conflicts
with his sport and the other 5 participants withdrew of their own volition due to the
inability to tolerate the physical demands of the testing protocol
Inclusion/exclusion criteria
This study was limited to males in order to control for fluctuations in cortisol that occur
during the menstrual cycle. At initial enrolment, all participants self-reported to be free
from current injuries limiting their ability to train and complete physiological testing
Interventions
Intervention
Black tea extract: each 2-capsule serving contained 880 mg black tea extract and was
standardised for 350 mg theaflavin
4 capsules per day - 2 in the morning and 2 in the afternoon
Placebo
Not specified
Duration
Supplements were taken 9 days before and 2 days after exercise (11 days)
Outcomes
PRIMARY
Muscle soreness was assessed using a 10 cm visual analogue scale (VAS). The anchor at
0 corresponds to “no soreness” and at 10 to “too sore to move muscles”. Participants
were asked to perform one squat with hands on hips and then draw a line on the scale
corresponding to their level of soreness
SECONDARY
Wingate 30-second sprint was performed on a Monark 894E Anaerobic Test Ergometer
(Monark Exercise AB, Sweden). The load was set according to each participant’s mass.
The test was 30 seconds of all out cycling followed by 5 minutes of rest and then 8 x 10-
second intervals of all out cycling. Each interval was separated by 2 minutes of rest. The
resistance for the Wingate and intervals was set at 0.10 kP/kg body mass
Exercise type
30-second Wingate with 5 minutes rest followed by 8 x 10-second maximal sprints with
2 minutes recovery
Sources of funding
The study was funded by WellGen, Inc USA through an unrestricted research

Setting: laboratory; USA
n = 18 healthy men who were active in endurance sports but not resistance trained (9 in
each group)
Mean age vitamin group: 22.7 ± 4.1 years
Mean age placebo group: 22.3 ± 3.6 years
Inclusion/exclusion criteria
Participants were normally actively participating in endurance and sports activities but
not resistance training to ensure the whole-body resistance exercise protocol resulted
in detectable muscle soreness and muscle disruption. The participants had not lost or
gained weight in the previous year, were not adhering to special diets and were not regular
consumers of nutritional supplements including vitamin E. All participants were non-

variables in the study
Interventions
Intervention
Vitamin E supplementation 992 mg per day (1200 IU)
Number of capsules per day not specified
Placebo
Microcrystalline cellulose
Duration
31 days
Outcomes
PRIMARY
Delayed onset muscle soreness of the shoulders, chest, quadriceps and hamstrings was
evaluated using a visual analogue scale (0 to 10 cm) where 0 is “no pain” and 10 is
“extreme pain” after performing shoulder abduction, shoulder horizontal adduction and
hip flexion (unloaded squat)
Exercise type
Whole body resistance exercise training protocol; 3 sets of 10 repetitions of 30% to 60%

Inclusion/exclusion criteria
18 of the participants were accepted for, and completed, the 2008 London Marathon. All
participants completed a health screening questionnaire and a written informed consent
Interventions
Intervention
Tart cherry juice blend; 2 x 8 fl oz bottles per day. One bottle of the juice contained
the equivalent of 50 to 60 cherries and provided at least 600 mg phenolic compounds,
expressed as gallic acid equivalents, 32 g of carbohydrate and at least 40 mg of antho-
cyanins. One bottle in the morning and one in the afternoon
Placebo
Fruit flavoured concentrate mixed with 8 fl oz of water
Duration
5 days before and 2 days after
Outcomes
PRIMARY
Delayed onset muscle soreness was determined using a 200 mm visual analogue scale
where 0 is “no soreness” and 200 is “unbearably painful.” The participant stood with the
hands on hips and feet approximately shoulder width apart. The participant was then
asked to squat down to 90 degrees (internal joint angle) rise to the start position and
then indicate on the visual analogue scale the soreness felt in the lower limbs
SECONDARY
Maximum voluntary isometric contraction of the non-dominant knee extensors was
determined using a strain gauge (MIE Medical Research Ltd, Leeds, UK). Participants
were seated on a platform and the non-dominant ankle was attached to the strain gauge
at an internal joint angle of 80 degrees (verified by a goniometer). Participants were given
3 submaximal trials, each separated by 1 minute. Each contraction lasted approximately
3 seconds and all participants were given standardised verbal encouragement throughout
Exercise type
Participants completed the 2008 London marathon. The environmental conditions on
the day were barometric pressure: 758 mmHg; temperature: 7 degrees Celsius; wind
speed: 4 km/h; relative humidity: 56%; there were intermittent showers throughout the
day

n = 25 healthy college students and college employees. Of the 25 original participants, 2
dropped out of the experiment, 3 were excluded for a variety of reasons (loss of capsule
integrity, failure to properly maintain records, non-compliance with the experimental
protocol), and 1 was removed for failure to develop delayed onset muscle soreness in
either trial. Left with 19 participants (6 women and 13 men). Age rage 24 to 48 years
Inclusion/exclusion criteria
Participantswere excludedfromthe studyiftheywere olderthan50years,hadasensitivity

Outcomes
PRIMARY
Delayed onset muscle soreness was assessed at the quadriceps along a 10 cm visual
analogue scale where 0 is “no soreness” and 10 is “extreme soreness”
SECONDARY
Peak isometric torque was assessed using a Biodex System-3 isokinetic dynamometer 9
Biodex Medical Systems, Inc, NY, USA). Prior to testing participants warmed up on
a cycle ergometer for 10 minutes. Changes in dynamic strength of the knee extensors
was assessed by having participants complete 10 maximal repetitions in a concentric and
eccentric fashion
Peak dynamic torque was measured in the dominant knee extensors, a total of 3 maximal
voluntary contractions over 5 seconds duration were completed with 60 seconds rest
in between each repetition. Participants were verbally encouraged to produce maximal
effort throughout the entire 5-second period. The peak torque exerted throughout all 3
repetitions was regarded as peak isometric torque. All isometric repetitions were com-
pleted at an angle of 90 degrees flexion
Exercise type
10 sets of 10 repetitions at an isokinetic dynamometer; 1 minute rest between sets
Sources of funding
Partial funding for the study was provided by the National Strength and Condition-
ing Association through GNC Nutritional Research Grant, a Baylor University Faculty
Research Award for Darryn Willoughby, PhD and HHPR a graduate student research
award and indirect costs provided by grants awarded to Richard Kreider, PhD through

Intervention
90 mL daily for 6 days of tart Montmorency Cherry Juice (Prunus cerasus) concentrate
(Cherry Active, Sunbury, UK) diluted with water, such that each 30 mL serving was
made up into a 200 mL beverage. Both the cherry juice and placebo were consumed in
2 doses each day; 200 mL before morning training, and 400 mL in the evening post
training
Placebo
3 different ’off the shelf’ cordials: lime (Woolworths select lime cordial, Australia), cran-
berry (Bickford’s cranberry juice cordial, Australia) and raspberry (Cottee’s raspberry
flavoured cordial, Australia). Cordials were mixed with food colouring and 480 mL of
water in order to closely imitate the taste, colour and carbohydrate content
Duration
6 days
Outcomes
Primary
Delayed onset muscle soreness (delayed onset muscle soreness) was measured on a 0 to
10 scale in the upper body, upper legs, lower legs and overall body encompassing the
anchor points of 0 (normal; without pain or stiffness) to 10 (very painful)
Total quality of recovery was also recorded on a 6- to 20-point scale for the upper body,
upper legs, lower legs and overall body, which encompassed the anchor points 6 (very,
very poor recovery) to 20 (very, very good recovery)
Secondary
Swimming-based tests comprised of the in-water vertical jump test, 10 m sprint test, a
repeat sprint test and the Water Polo Intermittent Shuttle Test
Exercise type
A fixed training regimen for 6 days. All training (technical skill, weights, and swimming)
performed during the 7-day trials was identical, and took place in the controlled envi-
ronment of the indoor Water Polo pool or gymnasium
Sources of funding
Manuscript states: “Funds received from the Australian Institute of Sport and the Aus-
tralian Sports Commission”
Notes
This study was only included in the qualitative analysis because the exercise paradigm
was completely different to all the other studies included in this review. The other studies
used an exercise paradigm where mechanical or whole body aerobic exercise was used
to cause muscle damage and then a range of outcomes such as muscle soreness, muscle
function, range of motion and performance were measured at various time points up to
several days after exercise. However, participants in this study had a fixed daily training
regimen for 5 continuous days performance, with outcomes being measured at the start
and then throughout the trial. Thus the severity of muscle damage caused by the daily
training regimen was not controlled

Methods
Randomised controlled trial (balanced randomised cross-over design)
30 day washout
Participants
Setting: laboratory; New Zealand
n = 10 healthy active females mean age 22 (SD 1) years
Inclusion/exclusion criteria
All participants were physically active and participated in this study. All participants
were physically active and participated in recreational level resistance and aerobic-based
exercise at least twice per week. All participants had at least 1 years’ experience in training
in this manner. Participants completed a Health Screening Questionnaire to exclude
those who were at risk physically, culturally or religiously in following the protocol.
Those who passed the questionnaire were asked to provide written consent
Interventions
Intervention
Blueberry smoothie 200 g blueberries 50 g banana + 200 mL apple juice. Per 100 mL,
total phenolics 168 mg/gallic acid equ.; anthocyanins 96.6 mg; phenolic acid 26 mg,
flavonoids 10.2 mg; vitamin C 45 mg; vitamin E 3 mg
Placebo
Smoothie 25 g dextrose 50 g banana + 200 mL apple juice
Duration
4 days
Outcomes
PRIMARY
Delayed onset muscle soreness was recorded using a subjective 10-point scale where 0 is
“no soreness” and 10 is “very, very painful.” Participants were asked to step up (concentric
muscle action) onto a 40 cm box then step down (eccentric muscular contraction) and
the soreness was rated
SECONDARY
Muscle function was tested using an isokinetic dynamometer (Biodex Medical Systems
Inc. 2004). Range of motion of the leg was set at 60 degrees for concentric and eccentric
contractions and at 75 degrees for isometric contractions. The participants performed
5 maximal contractions of each type with each set separated by 2 minutes of recovery.
Concentric and eccentric torque was measured at an angular velocity of 30 degrees per
second
Exercise type
3 sets of 100 eccentric repetitions of the quadriceps

Participants
Setting: laboratory, Iran
n = 20 male non-athletic university students mean age 18.2 (SD 0.4) years
Inclusion/exclusion criteria
Participants were selected based on fitness and health screening tests and recruited in
a double-blind trial. Participants with history of any type of muscle injury, chronic
inflammation, coagulation disorders, immune system impairment and cardiovascular
problems were excluded. Participants were also excluded if they regularly participated in
vigorous exercise in the previous 3 months
Interventions
Intervention
Purslane extract 1200 mg given as 2 x 600 mg capsules per day
Placebo
Lactose powder placebo capsules
Duration
5 days
Outcomes
PRIMARY
A general rating of muscle soreness was assessed using a 0- to 6-point scale where 0
corresponded to “no pain” and 6 to “unbearably painful”. Participants were requested
to rate the discomfort in only the quadriceps and calf regions of the right leg
SECONDARY
Knee range of motion - participants laid prone on an examination table with both knees
fully extended. The knee joint angle was determined by using a goniometer and universal
landmarks to ensure alignment. Knee flexion range was determined when the participant
maximally and voluntary flexed the knee
Maximal knee extension isometric force was evaluated using a computerised dynamome-
ter attached to an adjustable steel chain. Participant was seated on a special chair with
knee flexed at an angle of 90 degrees then the ankle was fixed by a special belt connected
to a force transducer. During a 5-second test, force-time data were recorded on a memory
card

Mean age placebo group 20.6 (SD 1.1) years
Inclusion/exclusion criteria
All volunteers were moderately active non-smokers who had not participated in any form
of resistance training exercise in the previous 6 months. Volunteers who were currently
taking supplements in the past 6 months were excluded from the study

Duration
37 days
Outcomes
PRIMARY
Delayed onset muscle soreness was evaluated using a questionnaire employing a visual
analogue scale for a total of 8 sites (6 sites on the anterior muscle of the upper leg and 2
sites on the posterior muscles of the upper leg). The participants were asked to palpate
the relaxed muscle and rate soreness on a scale of 1 “normal” to 10 “very very sore”.
Results were summed for the 8 sites so that no soreness is indicated by a score of 8 and
maximal muscle soreness by a score of 80
SECONDARY
Maximal voluntary concentric torque for the knee extensors was measured at an angular
velocity of 0.5 rad/s 3 minutes to and 3 minutes following the eccentric contraction bout
on the Con-Trex dynamometer
Isometric maximum voluntary contraction force (MVC) and electrically simulated force
of the knee extensors were measured using a custom made isometric test rig. Volunteers
were seated in the upright position with their leg connected to a pre-calibrated load cell
(Novatech, Hastings, UK). Analogue signals from the strain gauge were converted to
digital information using an A:D convertor (Powerlab 1400, ADInstruments, Oxford-
shire, UK) and were recorded on a PC. The chair was adjusted to allow attachment of
the strain gauge above the ankle with the knee at an angle of 1.57 rad (90 degrees).
For MVC, volunteers were instructed to contract maximally for 3 seconds and verbally
encouraged during their effort. 3 repetitions were performed, separated by 1 minute.
The highest peak force value of the 3 repetitions was recorded as the MVC
Exercise type
30 sets of 10 eccentric knee extensions at a velocity of 0.52 rad·s−1

Placebo
150 mg of starch in 6 capsules of 25 mg each
Duration
1 hour before exercise and 12 hours after exercise separated by a 4-week washout
Outcomes
Primary
Muscle soreness was measured using a 100 mm visual analogue scale where 0 is “no pain”
and 100 is “extremely sore.” Soreness was measured upon palpitation of the upper arm
and passively extending the elbow joint
Secondary
Range of motionwasmeasuredbyactivelyextendingthe elbowjointmaximally(extended
elbow joint) and touching the shoulder of the same side with the hand (flexed elbow
joint angle). The range of motion was defined by the difference between the 2 elbow
joints. Each angle was measured by a goniometer 3 times and the mean of the 3 measures
was used
Maximum voluntary contraction of the exercised elbow flexors was measured using the
isokinetic dynamometer in the same positioning as the eccentric exercise and the elbow
joint angle was set at 90 degrees. 3 maximal isometric contractions were performed with
a 30-second rest
Exercise type
2 bouts of eccentric exercise of the elbow flexors on a Biodex dynamometer (Biodex
System 3, USA) using 1 arm for each bout separated by 4 weeks. Each exercise bout
consisted of 50 maximal eccentric contractions of the elbow flexors at a velocity of 120
degrees per second

Interventions
Intervention
200 mg vitamin C
Placebo
200 mg lactose
Duration
14 days
Outcomes
PRIMARY
Muscle soreness was assessed in the quadriceps using a 0 to 100 mm scale where 0 is
“normal” and 100 is “very very sore”. In order to activate the sensation of soreness, par-
ticipants assessed soreness whilst actively contracting the leg extensors against resistance
equivalent to 75% of each individual’s one repetition maximum
Exercise type
30 minutes downhill running at -18% gradient
Sources of funding
None

Methods
Randomised controlled trial (cross-over design)
Separated by a 14-day washout
Participants
Setting: laboratory; USA
n = 16 healthy, non-smoking, recreationally active males, mean age 24 (SD 1.4) years
Inclusion/exclusion criteria
Participants were disqualified if they had participated in resistance exercise training of any
kind in the previous 3 months, were currently participating in a formalised endurance
training programme or had previous history of upper body injury. Other exclusion
criteria included a recent weight change of more than 5 kg, history of hypertension, use
of anti-inflammatory drugs, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors lipid-lowering
medications or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors
Interventions
Intervention
Pomegranate juice POM Wonderful 500 mL twice daily, 650 mg polyphenols, consisting
of 95.5% ellagitannins, 3.5% ellagic acid and 1% anthocyanins
Placebo
35 g carbohydrate + colouring and flavouring to match the pomegranate juice
Duration
2 doses per day separated by 12 hours; 2 x 9-day treatment periods separated by a 14-
day washout
Outcomes
PRIMARY
Delayed onset muscle soreness of the elbow flexor muscles was determined before each
isometric strength test using a 0 to 10 visual analogue scale where 0 is “no soreness” and
10 is “unbearable soreness”. The rating was obtained before the measurement of strength
while performing unloaded elbow flexion of the tested arm
SECONDARY
Maximal isometric strength in elbow extensors was performed on a modified preacher
curl bench. Force was recorded using a load cell (LC101-500; Omega Engineering,
Stamford, CT) secured to the ground using a galvanised steel cable and a strap secured to
the waist of the participant. The participant performed 4 trials, 2 at both 150 degrees and
135 degrees of complete elbow extension, with a 180-second rest in between each trial.
Strength was reported as the average of the peak values at angles 150 and 135 degrees of
elbow flexion

Separated by a 14-day washout
Participants
Setting: laboratory; USA
n = 17 healthy, non-smoking, resistance-trained males; mean age 21.9 (SD 2.4) years
Inclusion/exclusion criteria
The participants were required to have been weight training for at least the last 3 months,
exercising both their upper and lower body, at least twice per week. Criteria for exclusion
were a recent weight change of > 5 kg; history of hypertension; the prescience of major
orthopaedic injury; use of anti-inflammatory drugs; over-the-counter pain medicine,
vitamin or mineral supplements, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors
Interventions
Intervention
Pomegranate juice 250 mL POM Wonderful (LA, USA). Each bottle contained ap-
proximately 1979 mg/L of tannins, 384 mg/L anthocyanins and 121 mg/L of ellagic
derivatives
Placebo
35 g carbohydrate + colouring and flavouring to match the pomegranate juice
Duration
44 days; 15 days of supplementation with a 14-day washout
Outcomes
PRIMARY
Delayed onset muscle soreness of the elbow flexor and knee extensor muscles was deter-
mined before each isometric strength test using a 0- to 10-point visual analogue scale
where 0 is “no soreness” and 10 is “unbearable soreness”. The rating was obtained before
the measurement of strength while performing unloaded elbow flexion and knee exten-
sion on the tested arm and leg
SECONDARY
Maximal isometric strength in elbows and knee extensors was performed on a modified
preacher curl bench and modified knee extension machine respectively. The participant
performed 4 trials at both 30 and 45 degrees above elbow extension and 45 and 90 degree
below knee extension with 180-second rest in between each trial. Strength for both tests
was reported as the average peak value of each joint angle
Exercise type
3 sets of 20 maximal eccentric elbow extensions on an isokinetic dynamometer
Sources of funding
The study was funded by POM Wonderful, L.L.C.

Since publication of the protocol (Ranchordas 2012), we made the following changes.
We updated the Background to reflect current evidence on the potential negative effects of antioxidant supplementation (in particularly
long-term use) by impairing exercise adaptations.
In Types of outcome measures, we stipulated that trials that did not record muscle soreness (pain) would be excluded. We included
a new primary outcome (subjective recovery) and we elevated adverse effects, originally listed as a secondary outcome, to primary
outcome status.
Linked with this was our selection of outcome measures for presentation in Summary of findings for the main comparison. This
included limiting the measurement of DOMS to five follow-up periods up to 96 hours.
In Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity, we removed the subgroup analysis “Type of antioxidants supplement (an-
tioxidants supplements vs. antioxidants-enriched food)”. This is because we realised that it was not possible to categorise studies into
’antioxidant supplement’ or ’antioxidant-enriched food’ as they usually belonged to both categories; for example, tart cherry juice is an
antioxidant-enriched food but it is also an antioxidant supplement containing vitamins such as vitamin C.
We merged two previous subgroup comparisons on types of exercise (“Normal sporting activities and laboratory induced DOMS”;
“Exercise that requires high oxygen consumption (e.g. running, cycling) and exercise that requires low oxygen consumption (e.g.
eccentric exercise in one arm)”) as the comparison of “whole body aerobic exercise” versus “mechanical exercise” captured both of these.
We included an additional subgroup analysis on sources of funding where we compared DOMS for studies that were funded by a food
company or provider of antioxidant supplements versus studies that were not funded by a food company or provider of antioxidant
supplements.
We could not compare the subgroup analysis ’timing of exercise’ because of insufficient studies in the ’supplementation after exercise’
group.
In Sensitivity analysis, we modified the sensitivity analysis testing the effects of high risk of selection bias to include also trials at unclear
risk of selection bias, relating to random sequence generation, allocation concealment or both. Additional sensitivity analysis to explore
the effects of excluding cross-over studies on the pooled data for muscle soreness at five time periods were conducted at screening by
the Cochrane Editorial Unit.
