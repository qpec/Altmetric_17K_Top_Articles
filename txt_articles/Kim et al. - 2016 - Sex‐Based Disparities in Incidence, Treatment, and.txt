Background-—Recent studies have shown improving survival after cardiac arrest. However, data regarding sex-based disparities in
treatment and outcomes after cardiac arrest are limited.
Methods and Results-—We performed a retrospective analysis of all patients suffering cardiac arrest between 2003 and 2012
using the Nationwide Inpatient Sample database. Annual rates of cardiac arrest, rates of utilization of coronary angiography/
percutaneous coronary interventions/targeted temperature management, and sex-based outcomes after cardiac arrest were
examined. Among a total of 1 436 052 discharge records analyzed for cardiac arrest patients, 45.4% (n=651 745) were females.
Women were less likely to present with ventricular tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation arrests compared with men throughout the
study period. The annual rates of cardiac arrests have increased from 2003 to 2012 by 14.0% (Ptrend<0.001) and ventricular
tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation arrests have increased by 25.9% (Ptrend<0.001). Women were less likely to undergo coronary
angiography, percutaneous coronary interventions, or targeted temperature management in both ventricular tachycardia/
ventricular fibrillation and pulseless electrical activity/asystole arrests. Over a 10-year study period, there was a significant
decrease in in-hospital mortality in women (from 69.1% to 60.9%, Ptrend<0.001) and men (from 67.2% to 58.6%, Ptrend<0.001) after
cardiac arrest. In-hospital mortality was significantly higher in women compared with men (64.0% versus 61.4%; adjusted odds
ratio 1.02, P<0.001), particularly in the ventricular tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation arrest cohort (49.4% versus 45.6%; adjusted
odds ratio 1.11, P<0.001).
Conclusions-—Women presenting with cardiac arrests are less likely to undergo therapeutic procedures, including coronary
angiography, percutaneous coronary interventions, and targeted temperature management. Despite trends in improving survival
after cardiac arrest over 10 years, women continue to have higher in-hospital mortality when compared with men. (J Am Heart

ardiac arrest remains an important cause of morbidity
and mortality in the United States. It is estimated that
there are over 300 000 out-of-hospital, nontraumatic cardiac
arrests in the United States annually.1 Though survival has
increased dramatically over the past 15 years, overall mor-
tality remains very high.2,3 Data from the Cardiac Arrest
Registry to Enhance Survival demonstrate modest improve-
ments in risk-adjusted out-of-hospital cardiac arrest survival
rates over the last decade, from 5.7% in 2005 to 8.3% in
2012. Patients with shockable rhythms (ventricular tachycar-
dia [VT] and ventricular fibrillation [VF]) expectedly have the
best survival rates, whereas survival for pulseless electrical
activity (PEA) or asystole remains poor.4 Despite grim
outcomes, there are marked regional variations in survival
after cardiac arrest, which reflect potential disparities in
mechanisms of national and local delivery of resuscitative
care.5 Furthermore, neurological outcomes among cardiac
arrest survivors have been improving, with fewer survivors
having severe disability after recovery.6,7

 percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).14,15 Despite recent
advances and a multispecialty team-based approach to the
treatment of cardiac arrest, there remains limited and
conflicting data with regard to sex-based disparities in
presentation and treatment of patients presenting with a
cardiac arrest. There has been ample evidence suggesting
that women have worse outcomes across a variety of
cardiovascular
procedures/surgeries,
including
coronary
artery bypass grafting surgery16 and primary PCI for ST-
segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI).17 However,
data regarding sex-based differences in outcomes following
cardiac arrest have been conflicting, with some studies
showing worse survival among women and others showing
comparable or even better survival in women.18–23 Given
limited and contradictory published data, we sought to
characterize sex-based disparities and trends in presentation,
treatment strategies, and in-hospital clinical outcomes for all
cardiac arrests, as well as for subgroups of VT/VF and PEA/
asystole, in a large, national contemporary database from
2003 to 2012. Our findings will further our understanding of
mechanisms contributing to the cardiac arrest sex gap and
may assist in the resolution of discrepant historical data.
Methods
Data Source and Study Population
Data were obtained from the Agency for Healthcare Research
and Quality Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project—Nation-
wide Inpatient Sample (NIS) files between 2003 and 2012.24
The NIS is a 20% stratified sample of all nonfederal US
hospitals and, in 2012, contained deidentified information for
38 590 733 discharges from 1049 hospitals and 46 states.
Discharges are weighted based on the sampling scheme to
permit inferences for a nationally representative population.
Each record in the NIS includes all procedure and diagnosis
International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes recorded
for each patient’s hospital discharge.
From January 2003 through December 2012, hospitaliza-
tions with a diagnosis of cardiac arrest either in the primary or
secondary diagnoses were included for analysis. Cardiac
arrests were identified based on the presence of ICD-9-CM
code 427.5. Out-of-hospital cardiac arrests were captured
when the code 427.5 was assigned as a principal diagnosis
and when a patient arrived at the hospital in a state of cardiac
arrest and could not be resuscitated or was resuscitated
briefly and pronounced dead before the underlying cause of
the arrest was identified. In-hospital cardiac arrests were
captured when the code 427.5 was assigned as a secondary
code and when cardiac arrest occurred during the hospital
episode and the patient was resuscitated (or resuscitation
was
attempted).
Cardiac
arrests
that
occurred
as
a
complication of surgery or complicating abortion, ectopic
pregnancy, or labor and delivery were excluded, as those
arrests were coded with different ICD-9-CM codes (997.1 and
669.4x). Among those who presented with cardiac arrests, VT
was identified by ICD-9-CM code 427.1, and VF was identified
based on the presence of ICD-9-CM code 427.4. PEA/
asystole arrests were defined as cardiac arrests without
concomitant ventricular arrhythmia. Acute myocardial infarc-
tion and pulmonary embolism were identified by ICD-9-CM
codes 410.x (excluding 410.7) and 415.1, respectively.
Weill Cornell Medical College institutional review board
deemed this study exempt because the Healthcare Cost and
Utilization Project–NIS is a publicly available database con-
taining deidentified patient information.
Definition and End Points
Patient-level and hospital-level variables were included as
baseline characteristics. Hospital-level data elements were
derived from the AHA Annual Survey Database. The Agency
for Healthcare Research and Quality comorbidity measures
based on the Elixhauser methods were used to identify
comorbid conditions.25 The outcome measures examined
included in-hospital all-cause mortality, likelihood of under-
going coronary angiogram, PCI, and TTM. Coronary angiogra-
phy was identified using the ICD-9-CM codes 37.21, 37.22,
37.23, 88.53, 88.54, 88.55, 88.56, and 88.57 in any of the 15
procedure fields during the same hospitalization. PCI was
identified by the ICD-9-CM codes 00.66, 36.03, 36.04, 34.06,
34.07, and 34.09. TTM was selected using the ICD-9-CM
procedure code 99.81.
Statistical Analyses
For descriptive analyses, we compared baseline patient and
hospital characteristics of those presenting with cardiac
arrest for each sex. Continuous variables are presented as
medians; categorical variables are expressed as frequencies
(percentages). To compare baseline characteristics, either
Mann–Whitney Wilcoxon nonparametric tests or Student t
test were used for continuous variables, and Pearson v2 tests
were used for categorical variables. We calculated the
incidence of cardiac arrests as the weighted number of
arrests divided by 20% of the total number of US adults during
the same periods. Estimates of the US adult population
between 2003 and 2012 were obtained from the US Census
Bureau.26 Trends in the annual rates of cardiac arrests,
coronary angiography, PCI, and TTM were assessed using time
series modeling (autoregressive integrated moving average
model) and were further stratified by sex.
Unadjusted rates of utilization of coronary angiography,
PCI, TTM, and in-hospital mortality rates were calculated for

 each sex. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to
adjust for baseline differences between men and women by
adjusting for univariate predictors of examined outcomes
(P<0.01). The models were adjusted for the following
demographic, hospital-level, and procedural variables: age,
race, hospital bed size, hospital teaching status, urban versus
rural setting, region, payer, anemia, collagen vascular disease,
congestive heart failure, chronic pulmonary disease, diabetes
mellitus, coagulopathy, hypertension, liver disease, neurolog-
ical disorders, obesity, peripheral vascular disorders, pul-
monary circulation disease, chronic renal failure, hemodialysis
dependence, valve disease, history of cardiac arrest, coma,
STEMI, pulmonary embolism, prior coronary artery bypass
grafting surgery, and prior PCI. Unadjusted and adjusted
analyses were then repeated for subgroups of patients
presenting with VT/VF and PEA/asystole arrests. For all
regression analyses, the Taylor linearization method “with
replacement” design was used to compute variances. All
statistical tests were 2-sided, and a P-value of <0.05 was set
a priori to be statistically significant. All statistical analyses
were conducted using SAS, version 9.2 (SAS Institute, Cary,
NC) and SPSS, version 20 (IBM Corporation).
Results
Study Population and Baseline Characteristics
Of the 1 436 052 discharge records analyzed from patients
who were transported alive to the emergency department of
acute-care hospitals with a cardiac arrest between 2003 and
2012, 45.4% (n=651 745) were females. Overall baseline
and hospital characteristics for all cardiac arrests, VT/VF,
and PEA/asystole arrests stratified by sex are shown in
Table 1. Women with cardiac arrest were older and had
more comorbid conditions compared with men. Nonischemic
causes of cardiac arrest (eg, pulmonary embolism) were
more common in women. Conversely, women were less
likely to have prior PCI or coronary artery bypass grafting
surgery and less frequently presented with concomitant
STEMI. Women were more likely to be treated in smaller,
nonurban, nonteaching hospitals compared with men. Car-
diac arrests due to VT/VF were more common in men
(26.7% versus 19.4%, P<0.001) throughout the whole study
period. Among VT/VF arrests, similar sex differences were
noted.
Cardiac Arrest Trends, 2003–2012
The annual incidence of all cardiac arrests, VT/VF arrests, and
PEA/asystole arrests increased between 2003 and 2012 by
14.0% (608 arrests per million adults to 693 arrests per
million adults, Ptrend<0.001), by 25.9% (136 arrests per million
adults to 171 arrests per million adults, Ptrend<0.001), and by
10.6% (472 arrests per million adults to 522 arrests per
million adults, Ptrend=0.003), respectively. There was a greater
increase over the study period in rates of all types of cardiac
arrests in men compared with women; 19.8% versus 7.4% (all
cardiac arrests, P<0.001), 32.6% versus 14.9% (VT/VF,
P<0.001), and 15.4% versus 5.7% (PEA/asystole, P<0.001),
respectively (Figure 1). In women, VT/VF arrests comprised
18.7% of all arrests in 2003 and increased to 20.0% by 2012
(Ptrend<0.001); in men, the proportion of VT/VF arrests
comprised 25.5% of all arrests in 2003, which increased to
28.3% by 2012 (Ptrend<0.001).
Utilization of Therapeutic Modalities
There was an increase in utilization of coronary angiography,
PCI, and TTM in cardiac arrest patients between 2003 and
2012. However, the changes in utilization of coronary
procedures were significantly greater in men versus women
presenting with cardiac arrests (Figure 2). From 2003 to
2012, the use of coronary angiography increased in men
(16.5–19.9%,
Ptrend<0.001)
versus
women
(12.1–13.4%,
Ptrend<0.001), the use of PCI increased in men (7.2–10.1%,
Ptrend<0.001) versus women (4.8–5.8%, Ptrend<0.001), and the
use of TTM increased in men (0–3.2%, Ptrend<0.001) versus
women (0–2.3%, Ptrend<0.001) (Figure 3). For VT/VF arrests
from 2003 to 2012, the use of coronary angiography
increased in men (34.6–42.3%, Ptrend<0.001) versus women
(28.4–31.7%, Ptrend<0.001), the use of PCI increased in men
(17.3–24.1%,
Ptrend<0.001)
versus
women
(12.5–14.7%,
Ptrend<0.001), and the use of TTM increased in men (0.1–
6.1%, Ptrend<0.001) versus women (0–4.2%, Ptrend<0.001). For
PEA/asystole arrests from 2003 to 2012 the changes were
less pronounced; the use of coronary angiography increased
in men (10.4–11.1%, Ptrend<0.001) versus women (8.4–8.9%,
Ptrend<0.001), the use of PCI increased in men (3.8–4.6%,
Ptrend<0.001) versus women (3.0–3.6%, Ptrend<0.001), and the
use of TTM increased in men (0–2.1%, Ptrend<0.001) versus
women (0–1.8%, Ptrend<0.001). Furthermore, women were
also less likely to receive ventricular assist or intraaortic
balloon pump support devices.
Table 2 shows the relationship between sex and the
likelihood of undergoing coronary angiography, PCI, and TTM
interventions. Women were less likely to undergo coronary
angiography, PCI, or TTM in all cardiac arrests, VT/VF, and
PEA/asystole. After adjustment with multivariate logistic
regression analysis, female sex remained associated with
less likelihood of undergoing coronary angiography or PCI. In
particular, women presenting with VT/VF arrests were 25%
less likely to receive coronary angiography and 29% less likely
to receive PCI than male patients. Furthermore, female sex
was associated with lower odds of receiving TTM in VT/VF

 arrests (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 0.81, 95% CI 0.76–0.87,
P<0.001), but not in PEA/asystole arrests.
In-Hospital Outcomes After Cardiac Arrest by Sex
There was a significant reduction in in-hospital all-cause
mortality from 68.1% to 59.6% (Ptrend<0.001) between 2003
and 2012 in the overall cardiac arrest cohort (Figure 3). In
women, in-hospital mortality declined from 69.1% in 2003 to
60.9% in 2012 (Ptrend<0.001), whereas in men in-hospital
mortality declined from 67.2% in 2003 to 58.6% in 2012
(Ptrend<0.001) (Figure 4). In the VT/VF cohort between 2003
and 2012, in-hospital mortality declined from 52.8% to 48.3%
in women (Ptrend<0.001), whereas in men in-hospital mortality
was reduced from 49.1% to 44.1% (Ptrend<0.001).
Table 2 shows the unadjusted and adjusted association
between sex and in-hospital mortality. In-hospital mortality
was significantly higher in women compared with men in the
overall cardiac arrest cohort (64.0% versus 61.4%; adjusted
OR 1.02, 95% CI 1.01–1.03, P<0.001), and particularly in the
VT/VF arrest cohort (49.4% versus 45.6%; adjusted OR 1.11,
95% CI 1.09–1.13, P<0.001) (Figure 4). Interestingly, in a
cohort of patients with VT/VF arrests receiving both PCI and
TTM, female sex was associated with even greater risk of
mortality compared to men (adjusted OR 2.11, 95% CI 1.46–
3.07, P<0.001). Conversely, among all patients receiving TTM,
female sex was no longer a predictor of greater mortality.
Discussion
There are several important findings in this nationally
representative sample of US hospital discharge records
examining sex-based trends of cardiac arrests, utilization of
procedures, and in-hospital outcomes between the years
2003 and 2012. First, the incidence of cardiac arrests,
particularly VT/VF arrests, continues to steadily increase over
time, irrespective of sex. Second, women with cardiac arrest

 showed that women had higher postarrest in-hospital mortal-
ity after multivariate adjustment compared with men, partic-
ularly for VT/VF arrests. Higher mortality was seen in women
with VT/VF arrests despite receiving maximal evidence-based
therapies, including PCI and TTM.
Recent studies examining trends in outcomes after cardiac
arrests have demonstrated improving overall survival rates,
similar to our finding.4,23 However, our study is the first to
report sex-based disparities across a representative spectrum
of cardiac arrest patients from >1000 US hospitals nationally.
Our study suggests that women presenting with cardiac
arrests in the United States have important phenotypic
differences; they are older, have more comorbid conditions,
are less likely to have preexisting coronary artery disease
(despite greater prevalence of risk factors for coronary artery
disease), less likely to present with STEMI, and less likely to
present with a shockable rhythm (19% versus 26%, P<0.001).
Lower prevalence of ischemic cause of cardiac arrest is only
one of the reasons why women present more often with
nonshockable rhythms. Warning symptoms preceding cardiac
arrest differ in men and women; women tend to experience
more atypical symptoms, such as dyspnea, and less chest
pain compared with men.27 Furthermore, identifying the
etiology of arrest as ischemic can be quite challenging despite
advances in diagnostic tools.28 Our finding that women
compared with men are less likely to present with a shockable
VT/VF rhythm has been reported in several studies.22,29,30
Prior investigations also suggested that women have fewer
arrests witnessed by bystanders, and are more likely to
present with arrests at home.22,31 Sex-based differences in
baseline characteristics and type of cardiac arrest are
complex and likely multifactorial. Some factors include
differences in the prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors
and ischemic substrate, initial symptoms upon presentation,
time between symptoms and cardiac arrest, whether the
arrest was witnessed or unwitnessed, presenting rhythm, time
to cardiopulmonary
resuscitation
and
defibrillation,
and
access to tertiary institutions with experience in resuscitating
cardiac arrest patients.
Our study demonstrates that women were less likely to
undergo coronary angiography and PCI when they presented
with cardiac arrests. This was particularly true for VT/VF
arrests, where utilization of angiography and PCI can be of
great diagnostic and therapeutic importance given the high
prevalence of ischemia-driven VT/VF in this population.
Recent studies examining cardiac arrest have shown an
association between immediate coronary angiogram/PCI and
improved outcomes.14,15 Studies addressing sex-based dif-
ferences in healthcare delivery have suggested that women
are more likely to utilize primary care and preventive services,
whereas they are less likely to receive services for acute
cardiac conditions.32,33 For instance, Khera et al demon-
strated that women are less likely to receive revascularization
for STEMI.33 There may be several reasons for underutilization
of angiography and PCI in this national cohort. Women are

 more likely to present with atypical symptoms prior to cardiac
arrest, which may lead to more delayed presentation and
underrecognition of ischemia as the etiology of cardiac arrest.
Lower rates of angiography and PCI may also be due to higher
frequency of alternative
etiologies,
such as pulmonary
embolism. Furthermore, revascularization in women is asso-
ciated with �2-fold higher bleeding risk,34,35 which can lead
to more reserved use of angiography and PCI, particularly
when the etiology of cardiac arrest is not clearly identified.
Our study demonstrated that women had higher risk-
adjusted in-hospital mortality than men, particularly when
presenting with VT/VF arrests. This is in contrast to a recently
published meta-analysis by Bougouin et al, where women
were found to have better survival after cardiac arrest.22 It
should be noted that our study is the largest report thus far
examining the association between sex and survival postar-
rest, considerably larger than the aforementioned meta-
analysis of 409 323 patients examined in 13 studies. Most of
the prior studies suggesting improved survival in women were
performed in Japan or Sweden, which greatly differ from US
health care in algorithms and access to resuscitative
care.29,36 On the other hand, similar to our analysis, Wong
et al in a large Canadian population-based cohort of 34 291
out-of-hospital cardiac arrests showed lower 30-day unad-
justed survival rates in women versus men (30-day survival:
11.6% women versus 13.8% men in 2010–2011).23 The
analysis from prospectively collected data in 29 US cities
from the Cardiac Arrest
Registry
to Enhance Survival
suggested that females in the 12- to 49-year-old age group
had the largest association with improved survival to hospital
discharge (OR 1.55, 95% CI 1.20–2.00).37 However, this
association was no longer present in women after age
>55 years. Given that the mean age of women in our data set
was 67, the association with poor survival to discharge in our
cohort is not completely unexpected.
Lower use of angiography and revascularization cannot be
the only reason to explain higher in-hospital mortality in
women in our analysis. In a subgroup of VT/VF arrests treated
with PCI and TTM, risk-adjusted mortality was still higher in
women than men (adjusted OR 2.11, P<0.001). As mentioned
earlier, other negative prognostic features reported in women
include lower prevalence of initial shockable rhythm, less

 bystander-witnessed arrests, and more arrests at home.
Lower utilization of angiography/PCI in women is likely
related to the aforementioned factors, prolonged time to
resuscitation, and frequently unknown postarrest neurological
status. Additional potential reasons for higher mortality
include lower use of adjunctive guideline-driven medical
therapies in women presenting with STEMI,38,39 treatment
delays post–hospital arrival, delays in door-to-electrocardio-
graphy, door-to-needle, and door-to-balloon times.33,40 Fur-
thermore, survival bias may lead to higher observed mortality
seen in women. This is supported by data from Dudas et al,
which suggested that men are more likely to die before arrival
to the hospital than women.41 Future studies will need to
identify other reasons for sex-based disparities in risk-
adjusted mortality, which may include differences in comor-
bidities, presenting symptoms, basic and advanced life
support, utilization of medical therapies and revascularization,
and unmeasured covariates. This has been the focus of the
recent report from the Institute of Medicine’s Strategies to
Improve Cardiac Arrest Survival: A Time to Act (2015),
supported by the American Heart Association; American Red
Cross; American College of Cardiology; National Heart, Lung,
and Blood Institute; Centers for Disease Control and Preven-
tion; and Department of Veterans Affairs.42 Several multiso-
cietal efforts to increase cardiac arrest survival are currently
being reexamined, including establishing a national cardiac
arrest
registry,
setting
national
accreditation
standards
related to cardiac arrest for hospitals, adopting continuous
quality improvement programs, and creating a national
cardiac arrest collaborative.42,43 Moreover, the trend for
decreasing mortality may be due in part to growing public
awareness of cardiac arrest, more widespread distribution of
automated external defibrillators, streamlining treatment
algorithms, and increasing use of TTM.44
TTM is a strategy that has been demonstrated to improve
survival to hospital discharge and improve neurologic and
cognitive recovery postarrest.45 Recent studies have sug-
gested that combination of early coronary angiography with
TTM was associated with improved outcomes after cardiac
arrest.46 Given the body of beneficial data, the American
College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines
give TTM a Class I recommendation for successfully resus-
citated patients with VT/VF arrest and a Class IIb recom-
mendation for other types of rhythms.47 Similarly, the
European guidelines advocate the use of TTM in patients
with shockable rhythms, with a more reserved recommenda-
tion in patients without a shockable rhythm.48 Despite
widespread implementation of TTM since the publication of
original trials,6,7 there is paucity of data regarding real-world
utilization of TTM. Dresden et al showed that, although rates
of TTM use after cardiac arrest are slowly increasing, they
remain low (2.5% in 2010), with only 22% of US hospitals
providing TTM.49 Furthermore, there is also wide variability in
the use of TTM after cardiac arrest.45 A secondary analysis of
the Resuscitation Outcomes Consortium Prehospital Resusci-
tation using an IMpedance valve and Early versus Delayed
(ROC-PRIMED) trial demonstrated that the proportion of
patients treated with TTM varied between hospitals (range 0–
83%) and was higher in hospitals treating more subjects per
year.50 Our study demonstrated increasing use of TTM over
time, particularly for VT/VF arrests. Despite this encouraging
finding, the utilization of TTM in women presenting with VT/
VF arrests still lags far behind compared with men. Our study
is the first to report sex disparity in the utilization of TTM,
particularly in the VT/VF cohort. Importantly, in those who
receive TTM, risk-adjusted mortality rates were similar
between men and women. Given the current level of evidence
and Class I recommendation for TTM use in VT/VF arrests, it
is concerning to see sex-based discrepancy in the frequency
of TTM utilization. Given that TTM has been an important
addition towards improving survival and neurologic recovery
postarrest, further efforts by the medical community are
needed to close a sex-based gap in providing TTM postarrest.
There are several limitations present in our study. First,
this is a retrospective study based on a NIS sample that
approximates the national distribution of key hospital char-
acteristics. The results should be considered hypothesis-
generating, since we cannot infer causality. Our estimates for
cardiac arrests were derived from a representative 20%
sample of US hospitals, and it is possible that the number of
arrests was either underrepresented or overrepresented by
the sample. However, NIS has been used extensively to
examine national healthcare trends, and its sampling design
has been validated in numerous publications.51 Second,
unmeasured confounders could not be accounted for, includ-
ing initial symptoms upon presentation, time between symp-
toms and cardiac arrest, whether the arrest was witnessed or
unwitnessed, time to cardiopulmonary resuscitation and
defibrillation, varying severity of patient characteristics,
ejection fraction, medications, hemodynamic data, and pres-
ence and severity of coronary artery disease. This may have
impacted
unmeasured
confounders
that
could
not
be
accounted for in our adjustment models. However, a more
detailed exploration of the impact of such confounder drivers
is beyond the scope of this analysis. Third, survival bias may
lead to higher observed mortality seen in women. Lastly, both
out-of-hospital and in-hospital arrests were included in this
study. The ICD-9-CM codes were used to assess the incidence
of cardiac arrests, which may have underestimated the true
incidence of these events. However, our goal was to compare
sex-based differences in incidence, utilization of procedures,
and outcomes postarrest. Therefore, one would presume that
potential undercoding would affect men and women equally
and thus have minimal effect on the results of this study.

 In conclusion, there was a steady increase in the incidence
of cardiac arrests in US hospitals between 2003 and 2012,
particularly VT/VF arrests. Women were less likely than men
to undergo coronary angiography, PCI, and TTM postarrest.
Women had higher risk-adjusted in-hospital mortality than
men, particularly after VT/VF arrests. These data present an
opportunity to improve national cardiac arrest processes and
outcomes, and to focus on reducing sex-based disparities in
caring for postarrest patients.
