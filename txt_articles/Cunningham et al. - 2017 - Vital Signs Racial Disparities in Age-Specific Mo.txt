Abstract
Background: Although the overall life expectancy at birth has increased for both blacks and whites and the gap between 
these populations has narrowed, disparities in life expectancy and the leading causes of death for blacks compared with 
whites in the United States remain substantial. Understanding how factors that influence these disparities vary across the 
life span might enhance the targeting of appropriate interventions.
Methods: Trends during 1999–2015 in mortality rates for the leading causes of death were examined by black and white 
race and age group. Multiple 2014 and 2015 national data sources were analyzed to compare blacks with whites in selected 
age groups by sociodemographic characteristics, self-reported health behaviors, health-related quality of life indicators, 
use of health services, and chronic conditions.
Results: During 1999–2015, age-adjusted death rates decreased significantly in both populations, with rates declining 
more sharply among blacks for most leading causes of death. Thus, the disparity gap in all-cause mortality rates narrowed 
from 33% in 1999 to 16% in 2015. However, during 2015, blacks still had higher death rates than whites for all-cause 
mortality in all groups aged <65 years. Compared with whites, blacks in age groups <65 years had higher levels of some 
self-reported risk factors and chronic diseases and mortality from cardiovascular diseases and cancer, diseases that are 
most common among persons aged ≥65 years.
Conclusions and Implications for Public Health Practice: To continue to reduce the gap in health disparities, these 
findings suggest an ongoing need for universal and targeted interventions that address the leading causes of deaths 
among blacks (especially cardiovascular disease and cancer and their risk factors) across the life span and create equal 
opportunities for health.
Introduction
Blacks or African Americans (referred to as blacks in this 
report) are the third largest racial/ethnic population in the 
United States, after whites and Hispanics (1). In 2014, life 
expectancy at birth was 75.6 years for blacks and 79.0 years 
for whites, an increase of 3.8 years from 71.8 years and an 
increase of 1.7 years from 77.3 years in 2000, respectively (2). 
Despite this improvement, disparities in the leading causes of 
deaths for blacks compared with whites are pronounced by 
early and middle adulthood, especially deaths from homicide 
and chronic conditions such as heart disease and diabetes (2,3). 
In addition, blacks have the highest death rate and shorter 
survival rate for all cancers combined compared with whites in 
the United States (4). Although many of these chronic condi-
tions are usually associated with adulthood, the initial stages 
of some chronic conditions arise early in life (5). The analyses 
presented in this report used recent mortality and two national 
surveillance data sets to compare rates for the leading causes of 
death and the prevalences of chronic diseases, related health 
behaviors, health-related quality of life indicators, and health 
care utilization practices for blacks compared with whites 
by age group to identify disparities across the life span; such 
information could facilitate targeted interventions.
Methods
Age-adjusted death rates for blacks and whites of all ages 
(including children) and also age-specific trends for the leading 
selected causes of death among blacks for four adult age groups 
(18–34, 35–49, 50–64, and ≥65 years) were examined for the 
period 1999–2015. In addition, age-specific sociodemographic 
characteristics and death rates were examined and compared 
by race and age group. Age-specific prevalences of selected 
self-reported chronic diseases, related health behaviors, health-
related quality of life indicators, and health care utilization prac-
tices were also examined and compared by race and age group.

Key Points
• In the United States, there were fewer age-adjusted deaths 
per 100,000 during 2015 compared with 1999, with 
284 fewer among blacks and 120 fewer among whites.
• Despite of the narrowing of disparities in death rate for 
blacks and whites, disparities in the leading causes of 
deaths for blacks compared with whites remain large 
and persistent across the life span. Blacks had higher 
death rates than whites for all-cause mortality in all age 
groups <65 years.
• Blacks had significantly lower educational attainment 
and home ownership and almost twice the proportion of 
households below the poverty level compared with whites 
across the life span. This might help explain disparities 
in mortality via chronic disease related–behaviors, health-
related quality of life, and health care utilization.
• Universal and targeted interventions are needed to 
reduce black-white health disparities across the life span.
• Additional information is available at https://www.cdc.
gov/vitalsigns/.
Mortality data were analyzed using the CDC WONDER 
system, an interactive Web-based tool.* CDC WONDER 
mortality data are provided by the National Vital Statistics 
System and are based on information from all resident death 
certificates filed in the 50 states and the District of Columbia. 
CDC WONDER queries generated age-specific death rates 
and 95% confidence intervals for blacks and whites for all 
causes of death and leading causes of death among blacks† 
compared with whites in each age group during 1999–2015. 
Age-adjusted death rates also were obtained for all ages com-
bined, including children. Rate ratios compared death rates for 
blacks to those for whites; the 95% confidence interval (CI) 
for each rate ratio was calculated (6), and statistical significance 
was determined at alpha = 0.05; 95% CIs that did not include 
1.0 were considered indicative of a statistically significant dif-
ference between blacks and whites.
Population numbers, the sex distribution, and the percent-
age of each race with a Hispanic origin were obtained for each 
age group from the most recent available estimated postcensal 
population counts for 2014§ from the U.S. Census Bureau. 
Selected socioeconomic characteristics (U.S. nativity, educa-
tion <12 years education, household poverty, home ownership 
by the household head, and lack of health insurance) of the 
2014 population by race and age group were obtained from 
the 2014 American Community Survey Public Use Microdata 
Sample,¶ which is an ongoing national household survey of 
the U.S. Census Bureau.
Self-reported information on chronic diseases, health behav-
iors, health-related quality of life indicators, and health care 
utilization practices were obtained from the 2015 Behavioral 
Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), which is an annual 
state-based, random-digit-dialed telephone (cell phone and 
landline) survey of the noninstitutionalized U.S. population 
aged ≥18 years.** The median state response rate for the 
combined landline and cell phone surveys was 47.2%. Self-
reported health behaviors among all respondents included 
current cigarette smoking (having smoked at least 100 ciga-
rettes in the lifetime and smoking daily or somedays), lack of 
leisure-time physical activity in the past 30 days, and binge 
drinking (five or more drinks for men, or four or more drinks 
for women on any occasion) in the past 30 days. Weight 
status indicators included having a normal body weight 
(body mass index of 18.5–24.9 kg/m2), and having obesity 
(body mass index ≥30 kg/m2) based on self-reported height and 
weight. Health care access and utilization indicators included 
having a personal doctor or health care provider, not being 
able to see a doctor in the past year because of cost, and tak-
ing medication to control high blood pressure (among adults 
with high blood pressure). Self-reported health-related quality 
of life indicators included fair or poor health status, frequent 
mental distress (≥14 days in past 30 days), and frequent physi-
cal distress (≥14 days in past 30 days). Chronic disease condi-
tions included reporting ever being told by a doctor or other 
health professional that the respondent had asthma, chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease, high blood pressure, high blood

† Leading causes of death are defined by International Classification of Diseases, 
Tenth Revision (ICD-10) codes for diseases that are reported as the underlying 
cause of death on the death certificate. Among blacks in 2015, the 10 leading 
causes of death for ages 18–34 years were 1) homicide (U01–U02, X85–Y09, 
Y87.1); 2) unintentional injury (V01–X59, Y85–Y86), 3) diseases of heart 
(I00–I09, I11, I13, I20–I51); 4) suicide (U03, X60–X84, Y87.0); 5) malignant 
neoplasms (C00–C997); 6) human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease 
(B20–B24), 7) diabetes mellitus (E10–E14); 8) pregnancy, childbirth and the 
puerperium (O00–O99); 9) cerebrovascular disease (I60–I69); and 10) anemias 
(D50–D64) . For ages 35–49 years the leading causes were 1) diseases of heart; 
2) malignant neoplasms; 3) unintentional injury; 4) homicide; 5) diabetes 
mellitus; 6) cerebrovascular disease; 7) HIV disease; 8) suicide; 9) nephritis, 
nephrotic syndrome and nephrosis (N00–N07, N17–N19, N25–N27); and 
10) septicemia (A40–A41). For ages 50–64 years the leading causes were 
1) malignant neoplasms; 2) diseases of heart; 3) unintentional injury; 
4) diabetes mellitus; 5) cerebrovascular disease; 6) chronic lower respiratory 
disease (J40–J47); 7) nephritis, nephrotic syndrome and nephrosis; 8) chronic 
liver disease and cirrhosis (K70, K73–K74); 9) septicemia; and 10) HIV disease. 
For ages ≥65 years the leading causes were 1) diseases of heart; 2) malignant 
neoplasms; 3) cerebrovascular disease; 4) diabetes mellitus; 5) Alzheimer’s disease 
(G30); 6) chronic lower respiratory disease; 7) nephritis, nephrotic syndrome 
and nephrosis; 8) septicemia; 9) influenza and pneumonia (J09–J18); and 
10) essential hypertension and hypertensive renal disease (I10, I12, I15).

cholesterol, diabetes, coronary heart disease (including heart 
attack or angina), stroke, or cancer (excluding skin cancer).
Statistical software that accounts for the complex sampling 
design of the BRFSS was used for analyses to obtain age-specific 
prevalences by race, prevalence ratios that compared blacks with 
whites, and CIs. For comparisons of BRFSS indicators by race, 
statistical significance (p<0.05) was determined in age-specific 
logistic regression by the Wald F-test.
Results
In 1999, age-adjusted death rates for any cause of death 
were 1,135.7 per 100,000 blacks and 854.6 per 100,000 
whites (Table 1). By 2015, the racial gap had narrowed with 
age-adjusted death rates of 851.9 per 100,000 blacks and 
735.0 per 100,000 whites. The age-adjusted death rate in 
2015 relative to that in 1999 had declined 25% for blacks and 
14% for whites; there were 284 fewer age-adjusted deaths per 
100,000 blacks during 2015 compared with 1999, whereas 
there were 120 fewer age-adjusted deaths per 100,000 whites. 
The disparity gap in all-cause mortality rates decreased from 
33% in 1999 to 16% in 2015. Among adults aged ≥65 years, 
the death rate in 2015 relative to that in 1999 declined 27% 
for blacks and 17% for whites, resulting in a crossover in death 
rates beginning in 2010, when blacks had lower death rates 
than whites (Figure 1).
Age-specific deaths for selected leading causes of death 
among blacks declined between 1999 and 2015 (Figure 2). 
Notable declines, for example, included heart disease (15%), 
cancer (24%), and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) 
disease (80%) at ages 18–34 years; heart disease (22%), can-
cer (38%), and HIV disease (79%) at ages 35–49 years; and 
heart disease (32% and 43%), cancer (27% and 29%) and 
cerebrovascular disease (34% and 41%) for the 50–64 and 
≥65 age groups (Table 1).
During 2014, sociodemographic characteristics differed by 
race (Table 2). Blacks in each age group were more likely than 
whites to have <12 years of education, to be unemployed, live 
below the poverty level, and less likely to live in a household 
where the head of household owned the home. Blacks were more 
likely to have no health insurance than whites for the 18–34, 
35–49, and 50–64 age groups, but few persons in either popu-
lation reported having no health insurance at age ≥65 years.
During 2015, health behaviors differed between the two 
populations (Table 3). Blacks were more likely to be obese, to 
have no leisure time physical activity, and less likely to have a 
normal body weight in all age groups compared with whites. 
In contrast, blacks were less likely to report binge drinking 
than whites. Although blacks had higher prevalences of cur-
rent cigarette smoking than whites at ages 50–64 years and 
≥65 years, they had a lower prevalence at ages 18–34 years.
In all age groups, blacks were more likely than whites to 
report not being able to see a doctor in the past year because 
of cost. Blacks aged 18–34 years were less likely to have a 
personal doctor or health care provider than whites (Table 3). 
Blacks with high blood pressure were more likely than whites 
in each age group to report taking medication to control it.
Blacks in all age groups were more likely to report fair to poor 
health status than whites (Table 3). Blacks were more likely 
than whites to report frequent mental distress and frequent 
physical distress at age ≥50 years. The prevalence of having 
diagnoses of some chronic conditions was higher among blacks 
than whites across age groups, including for asthma, high blood 
pressure, diabetes, and stroke. In contrast, blacks across all age 
groups were less likely than whites to report a cancer diagnosis.
In 2015, blacks had 40% higher death rates than whites for 
all-cause mortality in all age groups <65 years (Table 4). At 
ages 18–34 years, blacks had higher death rates than whites 
for eight of the 10 leading causes of death among blacks in 
that age group (heart disease; cancer; cerebrovascular disease; 
diabetes mellitus; homicide; HIV disease; and conditions 
resulting from pregnancy, childbirth, and the puerperium). At 
ages 35–49 years, blacks had higher death rates than whites 
for heart disease; cancer; cerebrovascular disease; diabetes mel-
litus; homicide; nephritis, nephrotic syndrome, and nephrosis; 
septicemia; and HIV disease. At ages 50–64 years, blacks had 
higher death rates than whites for leading chronic diseases 
(heart disease, cancer; cerebrovascular disease; diabetes mel-
litus; and nephritis, nephrotic syndrome, and nephrosis) as 
well as for unintentional injury, septicemia, and HIV disease. 
Death rates from heart disease, cancer, cerebrovascular disease, 
diabetes mellitus, and homicide began increasing at earlier 
ages among blacks than among whites. There were significant 
declines in deaths from HIV disease in the past 17 years for 
both racial populations. Among persons aged 35–49 years, 
there were 45 fewer HIV disease deaths per 100,000 among 
blacks during 2015 compared with 1999, while among whites 
there were six fewer HIV disease deaths (Table 1). However, 
during 2015, blacks in age groups 18–34, 35–49, and 50–64 
were seven to nine times more likely than whites to die from 
HIV disease. Some age groups of blacks had lower death rates 
than whites for four leading causes of death: ages 18–49 years 
for unintentional injuries, ages 50–64 years for chronic liver 
disease and cirrhosis, ages ≤49 years for suicide, and ages 
≥65 years for Alzheimer’s disease.
Conclusions and Comment
During 1999–2015, age-adjusted death rates decreased 
by 25% for blacks and 14% for whites, with 284 fewer age-
adjusted deaths per 100,000 blacks and 120 fewer age-adjusted 
deaths per 100,000 whites during 2015 compared with 1999.

Among persons aged ≥65 years, there was a black-white mortal-
ity crossover, whereby blacks had slightly lower age-adjusted 
deaths than whites beginning in 2010. In addition, during 
1999–2015, blacks saw declines in the two leading causes of 
death, heart disease and cancer, across all age groups. However, 
despite substantive reductions in death rates among blacks in 
the United States, blacks continue to have higher death rates 
overall, higher prevalence of many chronic health conditions, 
and lower prevalence of some healthy behaviors. Blacks were 
less likely to participate in leisure-time physical activity and 
maintain a healthy weight. Blacks were more likely to report 
not being able to see a doctor because of cost, even though, 
across age groups, the percentages of blacks and whites who 
reported having a personal doctor or health care provider were 
approximately equal.
In addition, this analysis shows that blacks had significantly 
lower educational attainment and home ownership and almost 
twice the proportion of households living below the poverty 
level and unemployed than whites in all age groups. Such 
social factors are posited as “fundamental causes” because they 
influence chronic conditions, related behaviors, health-related 
quality of life, and health care utilization by constraining 
persons’ abilities to engage in prevention or treatment (7,8). 
These differences in “fundamental causes,” health behaviors, 
and access to health care contribute to the excess deaths and 
chronic conditions among younger black adults that are most 
common among persons aged ≥65 years. For example, blacks 
in age groups 18–34 and 35–49 were nearly twice as likely to 
die from heart disease, stroke, and diabetes as whites. These 
findings are generally consistent with previous reports that 
use the term “weathering” to suggest that blacks experience 
premature aging and earlier health decline than whites, and 
that this decline in health accumulates across the entire life 
span and potentially across generations, as a consequence of 
psychosocial, economic, and environmental stressors (9,10).
Taken in the context of other research, the substantial dif-
ferences in mortality, health behaviors, access to health care, 
and social factors across the life span identified in this analysis 
highlight the importance of a dual strategy of universal and 
targeted interventions to address disparities in black health 
(11). Opportunities for interventions have been identified 
that decision-makers, public health programs, clinicians, and 
communities can use. The Community Preventive Services 
Task Force has recommendations for interventions with proven 
effectiveness for the prevention of obesity, physical inactivity, 
tobacco use, promotion of cancer screening, and medication 
adherence (https://www.thecommunityguide.org/). CDC 
has also released a series of violence prevention technical 
packages to help communities use the strategies with the best 
available evidence (https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/
pub/technical-packages.html). To ensure continued progress 
in improving health for all U.S. residents, targeted interven-
tions for populations living in vulnerable social and economic 
conditions (e.g., poverty or racially segregated neighborhoods 
with fewer resources) also should be considered. The U.S. 
Department of Health and Human Services Action Plan to 
Reduce Racial and Ethnic Health Disparities promotes targeted 
interventions to reduce these disparities (https://www.minori-
tyhealth.hhs.gov/npa/files/Plans/HHS/HHS_Plan_complete.
pdf). In addition, The Racial and Ethnic Approaches to 
Community Health (REACH) program, which supports tar-
geted interventions through community-based, participatory 
approaches, identified strategies to address health disparities 
for blacks and other racial/ethnic populations (12–15).
The findings in this report are subject to at least six limita-
tions. First, information about many characteristics were self-
reported and subject to recall and social desirability biases, 
although this is unlikely to account for large disparities within 
the analyses (16). Second, this was a cross-sectional analysis, 
and data do not allow a comparison of rates for the same cohort 
as they aged (16). Third, the American Community Survey 
and BRFSS are household surveys and exclude persons living 
in institutions, long-term care facilities, and prisons. Fourth, 
there are technical and conceptual limitations associated with 
examining race in epidemiologic analyses because it is complex 
and generally represents other economic, psychosocial, and 
environmental factors (17–19). Fifth, although whites were 
considered as the benchmark (20), or referent in this analysis, 
blacks had lower death rates for unintentional injury and 
suicide in some age groups and lower prevalences of binge 
drinking. Finally, differences within blacks and whites by sex, 
socioeconomic characteristics, and Hispanic subgroups were 
not considered, yet might modulate some of the relationships 
seen overall.
Optimizing health for all U.S. residents while also eliminat-
ing disparities remains an integral part of disease prevention 
and health promotion activities. Although significant strides 
have been made in the United States in the last 17 years, 
disparities still exist. To continue to improve the health of the 
black population, there is a continued need to translate research 
results into effective universal and targeted interventions across 
the life span to inform action.

Abbreviations: CI = confidence interval; HIV = human immunodeficiency virus; RR = rate ratio comparing death rates for blacks to that for whites.
* Rates (per 100,000 population) are provided for both blacks and whites. Overall death rates (per 100,000 population) for all ages including infants and children are age-standardized to the 
U.S. 2000 projected population.
† Presented in rank order for the total black U.S. population (all ages) based on total numbers of death in 2015 with rank order for the total white U.S. population in parentheses. Age-specific 
data are provided for both race groups only for the top 10 leading causes of death among the black U.S. population in each age group.
§ Statistical significance at alpha=0.05; 95% CI did not include 1.0.
¶ Unstable death rate for whites aged 18–49 years because there were only 35 deaths from anemias in this subgroup in 2015.
