Background Previous reviews examining the effect of participation
in trials on outcomes have not consistently shown benefit.
Obstetrics and gynaecology is a unique disease area posing
challenges for both researchers and patients.
Objectives To determine whether participation in randomised
controlled trials (RCTs), compared with non-participation, has a
beneficial effect on women’s health.
Search strategy Medline, Embase, the Cochrane Library, and
PsycInfo were searched up to December 2015.
Selection criteria We selected studies that reported the same
clinical outcomes for participants in a women’s health RCT and a
comparable non-participant cohort.
Data collection and analysis Data were extracted on quality,
characteristics and study results. Outcomes were compared using
logistic regression.
Main results There were 21 relevant studies (20 160 women,
4759 outcome events). Trial participants, compared with non-
participants, had 25% better odds of improved outcomes on
average (OR 0.75; 95% CI 0.64–0.87; I2 = 64.3%). The
beneficial effect of participating in a trial was larger in
comparisons where: RCTs were of high quality (OR 0.62; 95%
CI 0.50–0.76) versus low (OR 0.92; 95% CI 0.74–1.16); and
RCT intervention was not available to non-participants (OR
0.57; 95% CI 0.47–0.69) versus when it was (OR 1.13; 95% CI
0.89–1.44). The effect of trial participation was not influenced
by effect size within the RCT (P = 0.48), whether funding was
received or not (P = 0.13), whether non-participants received
any treatment or not (P = 0.49), and the quality of the
comparison of RCT participants with non-participants
(P = 0.88).
Conclusions Women participating in RCTs on average
experienced better outcomes compared with those outside trials.

Introduction
Clinical research aims to benefit people in the future,
enabling them to live longer, healthier lives, but might it
also be of benefit to its subjects? Trial participants receive
care under enhanced oversight1,2 above and beyond usual
care, which is ensured by ethics and governance approvals,3
data and safety monitoring,4 and protocol compliance. Yet
research on the effect of participation in trials versus non-
participation has not consistently shown evidence of bene-
fit.5–8 This may be because the way innovations tested in
trials differ from care outside trials9,10 varies by clinical
area, and combining data from a number of specialities
into a single synthesis can mask an effect.

Systematic review
 ways:12,13 for example, due to the combination of mother
and offspring as a single unit, the social and cultural sensi-
tivities in gynaecology, complex disease processes, interven-
tions and outcomes, which may predispose participants to
benefit or harm in a manner that cannot be surmised from
the broad syntheses previously reported.5–8
Therefore, there is good reason to believe that the influ-
ence of trial participation in women’s health could be dis-
tinct from other specialties.14,15 The objective of this
systematic review was to test the hypothesis that there is a
benefit of participation in women’s health trials, versus
non-participation, and to explore reasons for heterogeneity.
Methods
We performed the review in line with current methodologi-
cal practice with a prospectively registered protocol (PROS-
PERO
registration
number:
CRD42015025007),16
and
reported it in accordance with the PRISMA statement.17
Data sources and study selection
We conducted a comprehensive literature search to identify
eligible studies in the specialty of obstetrics and gynaecol-
ogy18 adopting well-developed search strategies (Supporting
Information Appendix S1).8 Twenty-four obstetrics and
gynaecology RCTs were identified in a previous review
searching until 2010.8 We updated the search from this
review until December 2015 and filtered for studies in
women’s health by screening titles to identify additional
studies. We used a combination of keywords and word
variants: ‘randomised clinical trial’, ‘non trial’, ‘refusers’,
‘decline’, ‘preference trial’ and ‘standard care’ to interrogate
MEDLINE (1966 to December 2015), Embase (1980 to
December 2015), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled
Trials (CENTRAL; 1960 to last quarter of 2015) and
PsycINFO (1880 to December 2015).
Two reviewers (MD and SN) independently reviewed all
citations and abstracts to identify those that potentially ful-
filled the selection criteria. The final selection of articles
was based on independent review of their full texts. Studies
were included in the systematic review if an RCT in the
specialty of obstetrics and gynaecology reported the same
clinical outcomes for participants and their comparable
non-participants outside the trial in the same publication.
For meta-analysis, studies were retained if it was possible
to construct 2 9 2 data tables. Studies were excluded if
they lacked a comparable non-participant group, if the sub-
ject was outside obstetrics and gynaecology, if the paper
was about in vitro or animal research, or if the outcome
reported was not patient-centred. When duplicate studies
existed, we only used the most up-to-date articles. Dis-
agreements that could not be resolved between primary
reviewers were referred to an independent third adjudicator
(JZ or KK) who was not involved in the initial screening.
This involved the adjudicator reviewing the full text against
the inclusion and exclusion criteria.
Data extraction and study quality assessment
Data extraction was performed on a piloted form in tripli-
cate (MD, SN and NW/KK) to ensure reliability and accu-
racy. Disagreements were resolved via consensus (MD, SN,
NW and KK) or arbitration (JZ). For the selection of out-
comes we adhered to the principles employed by the defini-
tion of core sets based on relevance and importance to
stakeholders.19,20 In cases where core sets had not been
developed, the most clinically relevant patient-centred out-
comes (as judged by obstetrician-gynaecologist reviewers,
SN and KK) were identified prior to event rate data extrac-
tion for 2 9 2 tables. Extraction of continuous data was
complicated by the mixtures of post-intervention and
change from baseline results.21 We preferred post-interven-
tion results, but these were not reported in a manner that
allowed inclusion in meta-analysis. We also collected data
regarding the care setting, study design, and the interven-
tion and comparator within the trial, and their use among
non-participants. We attempted to collect missing data by
contacting study authors.
Quality of RCTs was assessed using the Jadad scale22
(scored 0–5) scrutinising the method of randomisation,
blinding and patient withdrawals or dropouts.22 RCTs with
a score of ≥3 were considered to be of high quality.23 Qual-
ity of the comparison between RCT participants and non-
participants
was
assessed
using
a
modified
Newcastle
Ottawa score (NOS)24 and focused on three domains
(scored using a star rating system) addressing the risk of
selection bias (baseline comparability), performance bias
(exposure to RCT or not) and ascertainment bias (outcome
assessment).24 Selection bias assessment (maximum 4 stars)
examined whether known confounding factors were mea-
sured, reported and found comparable. Performance bias
assessment (maximum 3 stars) scrutinised clarity of the
correct allocation of participants and non-participants to
within or outside RCT groups considering rates of switches
from RCT to outside group. Ascertainment bias assessment
(maximum 5 stars) evaluated whether RCT participants
and non-participants had similar methods of outcome
assessment, follow up of groups, and completeness of data.
Studies with ≥6 stars were considered to be high quality if
they scored ≥2 stars per domain.
Data synthesis
We calculated the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence
interval (CI) for each study using the 2 9 2 data tables for
comparison of outcomes amongst RCT participants versus
non-participants. We produced a Forest plot to visually
inspect
variability

and
computed

 I-squared statistic to quantify its magnitude (assuming 25–
75% indicated moderate heterogeneity).25 We examined
funnel asymmetry to test for publication and related
biases.26 We pooled the individual OR estimates across
studies using a random effects model.27
Multilevel logistic regression models including interac-
tion terms (the product of a covariate and main effect, i.e.
participating in a trial or not) were used to explore sources
of heterogeneity.28 Interactions found statistically signifi-
cant were further explored to produce estimates of the
effect of participating in a trial for the different subgroups.
We hypothesised that the effect of participating in an RCT
versus non-participation would be influenced by factors
related to the RCT (effect of intervention versus control
within trial, quality of RCT, and funding use) and to being
outside it (use of RCT intervention among non-partici-
pants, availability of other treatments or observation only
among non-participants, and quality of the comparison
between participants and non-participants); all six factors
were analysed.
Analysis was performed using STATA software (Stata-
Corp. 2014. Stata Statistical Software: Release 13. College
Station, TX, USA: StataCorp LP).
Results
Of the 17 013 records identified (Figure 1), 21 studies29–49
(20 160 women, 4759 outcome events) were included [see
Supporting Information Table S1 for excluded studies50–61].
The number of outcome events for RCT participants
included were 1055 and for non-participants 3704. There
was good agreement for study selection amongst primary
reviewers (weighted j = 0.82). Funnel plot analysis exhibited
no evidence of publication and related biases with either the
Begg’s (P = 0.25) or the Egger’s (P = 0.56) test (Figure 2).
Characteristics and quality of included studies
There were 11 obstetric and 10 gynaecological studies, pre-
dominately from high-income countries (Supporting Infor-
mation Table S2). With respect to design, all studies were
RCTs, of which eight were partially randomised patient
preference trials,35–37,40,42,44–46 and the others conventional
RCTs. Size of studies varied (median 293, range 33–5519)
with three papers involving <100 participants 29,32,33 and
four involving >2000 participants.39,43,46,48 All but one of
the studies48 were set in secondary care, defined as services
provided by medical specialists based in a hospital or clinic
setting. The trial interventions can be arranged into three
categories: medical 12, surgical 6, and other 3. Of the 15
studies that received funding,29,30,33,34,36,37,39,41–44,46–49 three
received
funding
from
commercial
organisations.34,43,44
Around half of RCTs were of poor quality mainly due to
inadequacies in blinding and in description of withdrawals
(Figure 3); lack of transparency of randomisation introduced
risk of bias in two studies.29,31 The quality of comparison
between RCT participants and non-participants was high in
18 studies; the remaining three studies had a risk of bias in
the selection and performance domains.29,30,40
Data synthesis
Overall, when compared with non-participants, RCT par-
ticipants had 25% better odds of improved outcomes on
average (OR 0.75; 95% CI 0.64–0.87; I2 = 64.3%) (Fig-
ure 4). Analysis exploring sources of heterogeneity showed
that the beneficial effect of participating in a trial was lar-
ger for two subgroups: high quality RCTs (OR 0.62; 95%
CI 0.50–0.76) versus low quality RCTs (OR 0.92; 95% CI
0.74–1.16); and when RCT intervention was not available
to non-participants (OR 0.57; 95% CI 0.47–0.69) versus
when it was (OR 1.13; 95% CI 0.89–1.44). The effect of
participating in a RCT was not influenced by the remaining

Discussion
Main findings
Our study found that women participating in trials had
better health outcomes than those cared for outside trials.
Our subgroup analysis demonstrated that the observed
effect was enhanced in comparisons involving high quality
RCTs and in comparisons where the RCT intervention was
not available outside the trial. The benefit accrued by
women participating in RCTs was sustained irrespective of
whether the RCT intervention was effective or not.
Strengths and limitations
To our knowledge, this is the first systematic review inves-
tigating the association between trial participation and out-
comes exclusively in women’s health. Building on previous
works5–8 that investigated this question more generally, we
focused on the obstetrics-gynaecology specialty.18 This is
the first review to report a significant benefit as a result of
trial participation. Due to the distinct nature of women’s
health we focused solely on this disease area and within
this subgroup analyses we observed an effect not previously
seen in overall syntheses. A retrospective study of a regional
cancer centre in the USA found clinical trial participation
to improve significantly the survival of women with ovar-
ian cancer compared with non-participants (median 46
versus 25 months, 95% CI 1.03–2.15 months, P = 0.03).62
That paper, though not part of our meta-analysis, reached
the same conclusion as ours.

Trial participation in women’s health: review
 Gathering data for our meta-analysis was challenging, as
few researchers conducting RCTs include concurrent non-
randomised
populations
in
their
studies.
Our
search
emphasised looking for comparisons within the same pub-
lications to seek studies where our question could be
addressed directly. However, if the RCT and the non-ran-
domised cohort were published separately and there was no
cross referencing in the published papers, there is a possi-
bility of missing such studies. For example, Cooper et al.63
reported an RCT without reference to their patient prefer-
ence cohort. Although our search picked up the Cooper
et al. RCT, in the absence of any identifiable information
within it about the non-randomised cohort, we could not
include this comparison in our review. To fully take into
account the impact of such omissions, a full further review

 would be needed, including study quality assessments and
re-analyses. However, using the author-reported primary
outcome (success of treatment at 6 months) it is possible
to see that in this individual comparison there was no sig-
nificant difference between participants (76%, 334/439) and
non-participants (82%, 276/338) (P = 0.06).64 Thus our
overall conclusion would not necessarily be invalidated.
Given the broad nature of women’s health we were
aware that there would not be a sufficient number of stud-
ies to conduct a meta-analysis of a specific disease area;
therefore we had to pool all studies found, leading to mod-
erate heterogeneity given the varieties of settings, method-
ologies, outcomes and interventions. In some cases, for
obstetric studies we selected outcomes related to the health
of the fetus (five studies) or neonate (three studies) and
not the woman, as fetal and neonatal outcomes are propor-
tional to the health of the mother and are influenced by
maternal interventions. To be pragmatic, we had to adapt
our protocol by reducing the number of variables such that
each subgroup could have sufficient number of studies for
a reliable analysis. A random effects model was appropriate
in light of the moderately high I_squared statistic. In a pre-
vious review,8 24 obstetrics-gynaecology RCTs were identi-
fied but not all had data available for our planned analysis.
In Table S1 we detail potentially eligible studies that we
excluded for transparency. Our results were not affected by
funnel asymmetry.
The majority of the comparisons between trial partici-
pants and non-participants were of high quality. Several
studies included in our meta-analysis were partially ran-
domised patient preference trials,35–37,40,42,44–46 an approach
that allows capture of a concurrent non-participant cohort
with the same eligibility criteria as those within the RCT, a
feature preferred over historical comparisons.65,66 However,
this design may allow for selection bias, as trial participants
that are given a choice of intervention may have inherent
psychological differences. For example, there may be differ-
ent levels of motivation and compliance in participants
given a choice of treatment versus trial participants where
choice was not offered. To minimise the risk of bias we
captured objective clinically important outcomes not influ-
enced by the subjectivity of preference. The quality assess-
ments (Figure 3) reassure us about the low risk of inherent
biases and improve the trustworthiness of our finding in
the context of observational comparisons.
Interpretation
The public, and even doctors, nurses and allied health pro-
fessionals, may regard research as an ‘experiment’, i.e.
something ‘dangerous’ relative to usual care. Our findings
challenge this concept, showing conversely that outcomes
are worse outside clinical trials, even if the RCT interven-
tion is not effective. Practitioners frequently provide new
care without the safeguards typically used to protect trial
participants.67 In this situation, the ‘dangerous’ experiment
is usual care outside a trial. As our result has shown an
overall benefit statistically, careful dissemination of this
information to potential participants is required. It does

 not pose a conflict with the ethical principle of the Helsinki
declaration that non-participation does not intentionally
affect standard care,68 but it does offer a new view for con-
sideration by ethicists: is it really ethical to offer care disen-
gaged from research?
Obstetric-gynaecological research poses social and ethical
challenges15 including safety of the fetus, limited observa-
tion time period (e.g. gestational duration), women’s life-
style including childcare responsibilities, sensitivity with
respect to relationships, and menopause. Further, women
are often excluded from clinical trials if they are of child-
bearing age, pregnant or breast-feeding, when they may still
be treated in routine care, thus making it hard to extrapo-
late results to this subgroup of women who may benefit
from the intervention.12 There has also been political, sci-
entific, and public concern over the lack of representation
of women in clinical research in recent decades.14,69 Thus,
there is a need for further research on the health benefits
specifically to women participating in RCTs in other fields.
It is important to remember that research can be associ-
ated with risk. The Women’s Health Initiative trial was a
large RCT that demonstrated that participation in a trial
may result in excess personal risk to participants and it was
prematurely terminated due to safety concerns.70 It is the
duty of researchers and clinicians to inform patients of
the potential risk and benefit of engagement in research.
The beneficial effect generated by trial participation should
galvanise clinicians and women into taking part in research,
increasing the value of funding and stimulating rapid
accrual to women’s health RCTs.
Implications for clinical policy and practice
The relative improvement in outcomes we observed within
RCTs
versus
outside
trials
merits
consideration.

 Participation in research should not be perceived as an
optional extra to practice. One of the major challenges fac-
ing research is recruitment failure.71 The positive effect on
health outcomes among women who participate in trials,
compared with non-participants, should encourage and
engage funding bodies (<1% of UK health research and
development funding is granted to maternal and perinatal
health11), policy makers, researchers, clinicians, women
themselves and their consumer groups.
As women’s rights are incorporated into global health
agenda through UN sustainable development goals,72 which
aim to achieve gender equality and empower women, the
opportunity to engage in research should be made integral
to service provision to recognise the role trials play in
improving outcomes of current patients, not just those in
the future. Governments, health insurers, and women’s
health systems should prioritise research activity including
women as a benchmark for service quality. As the saying
goes: a day without randomisation is a day without
progress.
Conclusion
Women participating in RCTs on average experienced bet-
ter outcomes compared with those outside trials. Active
participation in trials should be employed as a quality
benchmark for women’s health services. Further research
into the factors that have led to the observed benefit is
needed.
