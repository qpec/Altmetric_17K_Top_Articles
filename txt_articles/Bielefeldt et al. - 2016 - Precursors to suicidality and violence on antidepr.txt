Abstract
Objective: To quantify the risk of suicidality and violence
when selective serotonin and serotonin-norepinephrine
reuptake inhibitors are given to adult healthy volunteers
with no signs of a mental disorder.
Design: Systematic review and meta-analysis.
Main outcome measure: Harms related to suicidality, hostil-
ity, activation events, psychotic events and mood disturbances.
Setting: Published trials identified by searching PubMed and
Embase and clinical study reports obtained from the
European and UK drug regulators.
Participants: Double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in
adult healthy volunteers that reported on suicidality or vio-
lence or precursor events to suicidality or violence.
Results: A total of 5787 publications were screened and 130
trials fulfilled our inclusion criteria. The trials were generally
uninformative; 97 trials did not report the randomisation
method, 75 trials did not report any discontinuations and
63 trials did not report any adverse events or lack thereof.
Eleven of the 130 published trials and two of 29 clinical study
reports we received from the regulatory agencies presented
data for our meta-analysis. Treatment of adult healthy vol-
unteers with antidepressants doubled their risk of harms
related to suicidality and violence, odds ratio 1.85 (95%
confidence interval 1.11 to 3.08, p ¼ 0.02, I2¼ 18%). The
number needed to treat to harm one healthy person was
16 (95% confidence interval 8 to 100; Mantel-Haenszel risk
difference 0.06). There can be little doubt that we under-
estimated the harms of antidepressants, as we only had
access to the published articles for 11 of our 13 trials.
Conclusions: Antidepressants double the occurrence of
events in adult healthy volunteers that can lead to suicide
and violence.

Introduction
The reporting of harms in drug trials is generally
poor, with inadequate explanation of how they were
collected, and often harms are missing altogether.1,2
From 2011 to 2012, the Nordic Cochrane Centre
received
unredacted
clinical
study
reports
on
antidepressants filed for regulatory approval at the
European Medicines Agency and the UK Medicines
and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency. We
demonstrated selective reporting of major harms in
the published articles of duloxetine and inconsisten-
cies between the protocols and the clinical study
reports.3 Furthermore, we noticed that the adverse
events tables in clinical study reports had hidden sui-
cidal events due to the medical dictionaries and
coding conventions used.4 Based on the 70 clinical
study reports we received, we found that antidepres-
sants more than doubled the risk of suicidal and
aggressive behaviour in children and adolescents.5
A 2012 systematic review of 33 trials in healthy
volunteers documented various effects of selective
serotonin reuptake inhibitors but only mentioned
the adverse events in a few words.6 The review was
based on published articles and none of these lived
fully up to the CONSORT guideline for good
reporting.
Since their introduction in the late 1980s, the
benefits and harms of selective serotonin reuptake
inhibitors
and
serotonin-norepinephrine
reuptake
inhibitors have been the subject of huge debate.
Because their harms – in particular suicidality –
have often been explained away as if they were dis-
ease symptoms or only a problem in children,7–10 we
wished to quantify the risk of suicidality and violence
when
these
drugs
are
given
to
adult
healthy
volunteers.
Methods
According to our prespecified protocol (available
from
the
authors),
we
included
double-blind,
randomised
placebo-controlled
trials
of
selective
serotonin reuptake inhibitors or serotonin-norepi-
nephrine reuptake inhibitors (called antidepressants
throughout this paper) in adult healthy volunteers

 with no signs of a mental disorder. There were no
language restrictions. We excluded trials in abusers
of tobacco, drugs or alcohol and also imaging studies,
as these have another objective and furthermore are
of poor methodological quality.11
We searched PubMed (1966 to December 2015)
and Embase (1974 to December 2015) using the
search strings specified in Table 1. The searches
were conducted in collaboration with an information
specialist to ensure the inclusion of drugs that were
not indexed in PubMed’s MeSH thesaurus. One
researcher (AØB) screened all search results by read-
ing titles and abstracts, and all excluded studies were
rescreened by the same researcher who also read the
included studies and extracted relevant trial data, e.g.
design, population size, harms, discontinuations and
funding, to a spreadsheet. A second researcher (PBD)
extracted data on a randomly selected sample of 30
articles; as there were no discrepancies, we did not
perform data extraction in duplicate.
We also included relevant clinical study reports on
antidepressant drugs we received from regulatory
agencies for our projects in this area.3–5 We checked
whether the clinical study reports had been published
by searching for investigator names and drugs on
PubMed and Embase.
We defined harms as adverse events that were
either suicidality or violence or were considered pre-
cursor events to suicidality or violence in the litera-
ture, with a particular focus on the list of criteria used
by the Food and Drug Administration for its 2006
meta-analysis
of
suicidality
in
100,000
patients
(Table 2).12–18 We categorised the harms as suicidal-
ity, violence, activation events, psychotic events and
mood disturbances.
Uncertainties during data extraction were resolved
by discussion between the authors. If the reporting of
harms was unclear, we contacted the authors of the
trials for clarification. We assessed the risk of bias in
the trials focusing on randomisation and blinding.
We performed a meta-analysis calculating Peto’s
odds ratio for dichotomous outcomes with Review
Manager. Because of the considerable risk of carry-
over effects in crossover trials, we only used trials that
reported on periods separately.19,20
Results
We identified 5787 publications in PubMed and
Embase, removed 569 duplicate entries, and screened
the titles and abstracts of the remaining 5218 records,
which left 316 articles for full-text reading (Figure 1).
We excluded 174 of these articles because the studies
were crossover trials using antidepressant inhibitor, a
placebo and a third drug, or because the studies were
parallel trials that used a drug other than an antidepres-
sant as an interaction drug. This left 142 articles on a
total of 130 trials that fulfilled our inclusion criteria, 52
of which were two-period crossover trials. Ten different
antidepressants were tested in the trials; citalopram
(n ¼ 33) and paroxetine (n ¼ 27) were most commonly
used.
The
trials
did
not
report
much
about
their
methodology. All 130 trials were allegedly randomised,
but 97 (75%) did not describe the method and 75 (58%)
did not report any discontinuations or lack thereof.
Reporting of adverse events was generally inad-
equate; 63 trials (48%) did not report any adverse
events or stated that there were none; 43 trials
(33%) reported at least one adverse event; while 24
trials (18%) reported only the most frequently occur-
ring adverse events or those leading to discontinu-
ation. The source of funding was industry in 29
trials (22%), non-industrial sources in 47 trials
(36%), mixed in 17 trials (13%) and not reported in
37 trials (28%).
Thirteen of the 130 trials reported on at least one
of our predefined harms, 10 of which were parallel
group trials and three crossover trials. We could not
include two of the crossover trials, as there were no

 data for each period separately. We included the first
period of the third crossover trial, which ended pre-
maturely due to carryover effects despite a four-week
washout period.A1
We received 29 clinical study reports from the
regulatory agencies, two of which fulfilled our inclu-
sion criteria for the meta-analysis. None of them had
been published. Most of the remaining clinical study
reports described non-blinded bioavailability studies
or drug interaction studies.
Thus, we included 11 trials from our literature
searchesA1–A11
and
two
from
the
regulatory
agenciesA12,A13 in our meta-analysis. The drugs were
citalopram, escitalopram, fluoxetine, paroxetine, ser-
traline or venlafaxine, in all cases given orally. Four
trials were not industry sponsored and did not have
industry employees among the authors.A2,A3,A5,A7
Trial characteristics, length of treatment and our pre-
defined harms with reported severity are shown in
Table 3. The harms we found all occurred within the
randomised phase of the trials, not during the with-
drawal phase after the trials were finished. The median
age was 30 years; 40% of the volunteers were women,
and the median publication year was 2008.
Risk of bias in the included trials
Adequate methods for sequence generation and con-
cealment of treatment allocation were described for
six trialsA3–A6,A8,A11 and for concealment of alloca-
tion for two trials.A7,A12 The methods were not spe-
cified in five trials.A1,A2,A9,A10,A13 Adequate blinding
methods were mentioned for seven trialsA5–A8,A10–A12
and not specified in six trials.A1–A4,A9,A13 We did not

was side effects, not beneficial effects.
Meta-analysis
Treatment of adult healthy volunteers with anti-
depressants doubled their risk of harms related to
suicidality and violence, odds ratio 1.85 (95% confi-
dence interval 1.11 to 3.08, p ¼ 0.02, I2¼ 18%)
(Figure 2). The number needed to treat to harm one
healthy person was 16 (95% confidence interval 8 to
100; Mantel-Haenszel risk difference 0.06). Two clin-
ical study reports and one published trial reported the
severity of the harms.
Discussion
The century-old belief that patients with depression
are at heightened risk of suicide as they begin to
recover and their energy and motivation return21

 is being propagated everywhere, e.g. in the 2003 prac-
tice
guideline
from
the
American
Psychiatric
Association, which states that ‘clinical observations
suggest that there may be an early increase in suicide
risk as depressive symptoms begin to lift but before
they are fully resolved’.22
Because of this deeply ingrained idea, many
psychiatrists believe that when patients become sui-
cidal on an antidepressant drug, it is not an adverse
effect of the drug but a positive sign that the drug
starts working.7,10 However, a systematic review
from 2009 showed that the research that has been
carried out contradicts this belief,21 and our review
also suggests that it is wrong. We found that anti-
depressants double the risk of suicidality and vio-
lence, and it is particularly interesting that the
volunteers in the studies we reviewed were healthy
adults with no signs of a mental disorder. Our
results agree closely with a review of paroxetine
trials in both adults and children with mental dis-
orders using regulatory data released after a court
case. It included events both during treatment and
in the subsequent withdrawal phase and found a
doubling in hostility events (odds ratio 2.10, 95%
confidence interval 1.27 to 3.48).23
While it is now generally accepted that antidepres-
sants increase the risk of suicide and violence in chil-
dren and adolescents5,12 (although many psychiatrists
still deny this10), most people believe that these drugs
are not dangerous for adults. This is a potentially
lethal misconception.7,10,15,24
As far as we know, our review is the first of the risk
of suicide and violence in healthy volunteers. It was
inspired by David Healy’s work.7 In 2000, Healy pub-
lished a study he had carried out with 20 healthy
volunteers – all with no history of depression or
other mental illness – and to his big surprise, two of
them became suicidal when they received sertraline.25
One was on her way out the door to kill herself in
front of a train or a car when a phone call saved her.
Both volunteers remained disturbed several months
later and seriously questioned the stability of their
personalities.
In one of the two crossover trials we excluded
because we did not have data on the first period sepa-
rately, a healthy volunteer committed suicide, which
was mentioned in both published articles.A14,A15 She
had received duloxetine in increasing doses for 16
days, tapered off the maximum dose of 400 mg daily
very quickly (in just four days according to the design
of the study) and killed herself four days later while
on placebo. The authors, several of whom were
employees of Eli Lilly or owned stock in the com-
pany, judged her suicide ‘to be unrelated to study
drug treatment’,A15 although it is well known that
the suicide risk is high when an antidepressant is
stopped abruptly.10,23 There was no more informa-
tion about the suicide in the articles, and it was not
included in the listing of adverse events we acquired
from Eli Lilly, which only mentioned a woman who
reported suicidal ideation twice while on placebo. As
we do not know if this was the same patient, we asked
Eli Lilly for access to anonymised data for the volun-
teer who committed suicide and the detailed person
narrative, as we also wanted to know how it could be
possible to state that the suicide was not related to

 duloxetine, but the company refused to give us the
data.
In another of Eli Lilly’s studies, a healthy 19-year-
old student who had taken duloxetine in order to help
pay her college tuition hanged herself in a laboratory
run by Lilly.26 It turned out that missing in the
FDA’s files was any record of the college student
and at least four other volunteers known to have
committed suicide, and Lilly admitted that it had
never made public at least two of those deaths.26
In the other crossover trial we had to exclude, an
unknown number of volunteers discontinued parox-
etine due to restlessness, tremor and other adverse
events.A16 We contacted the corresponding author
of the study who referred us to the first author, but
despite several attempts of making contact via two
different email addresses and phone (to the doctor’s
assistant), this author never responded.
Exploratory analyses of the clinical study reports
Although only two of the 29 clinical study reports
were eligible for our meta-analysis, e.g. as the studies
needed to be double-blind, two researchers (AØB and
PBD) read them all (2224 pages) and extracted data
independently, as we wanted to explore possible
selective reporting of harms in the published articles.
Nineteen clinical study reports reported on the harms
we investigated and nine of these were published, but
less than half of the harms were reported in the art-
icles (21 of 50 events on antidepressants and two of
four events on placebo).
One of these studiesA17 was mentioned by David
Healy7 who had spoken with the study investigator,
Ian Hindmarch. It was a crossover trial of the
interaction between sertraline and diazepam that
was terminated due to unexpected adverse events
after only four days, before the first phase had been
completed and before any of the volunteers had
received diazepam. All five volunteers in the sertraline
group became agitated and four of them anxious,
while one of seven volunteers in the placebo group
became aggressive, agitated and anxious. The study
was never published.
Limitations
There can be little doubt that we underestimated the
harms of antidepressants. For 11 of our 13 trials, we
only had access to the published article, and it well
documented that the drug companies underreport
seriously the harms of antidepressants related to sui-
cide and violence, either by simply omitting them
from the reports, by calling them something else or
by committing scientific misconduct.2–5,7,10,27 In trials
of duloxetine and sertraline, for example, only 33 of
45 cases of suicidal ideation, attempt or injury listed
in a trial register were also mentioned in the pub-
lished reports.2
Psychiatrists believe that the suicide risk with anti-
depressants is only increased till age 24, but this mis-
conception builds on seriously flawed trial data that
the FDA has published.12 Several meta-analysts have
pointed out just how unreliable the trials are.5,10,28,29
A 2005 meta-analysis conducted by independent
researchers of the published trials included 87,650
patients of all ages and found twice as many suicide
attempts on drug than on placebo (odds ratio 2.28,
95% CI 1.14 to 4.55).28 They also found out that
many suicide attempts must have been missing;
some of the investigators responded that there were
suicide attempts they had not reported in their trials,
while others replied that they did not even look for
them. Further, events occurring shortly after active
treatment was stopped were not counted. Another
2005
meta-analysis
conducted
by
independent
researchers used UK drug regulator data and included
40,826 patients; they found a non-significant doubling
in suicides or self-harm events when events occurring
later than 24 hours after the randomised phase was
over were included (relative risk 2.14, 95% confidence
interval
0.96
to
4.75,
our calculation).29 These
researchers also noted that the companies had under-
reported the suicide risk in their trials, and they found
that non-fatal self-harm and suicidality were seriously
underreported compared to the reported suicides.
Even the FDA’s 2006 meta-analysis of 100,000
patients in 372 placebo-controlled trials12,30 is ser-
iously flawed. Based on trials that were included in
FDA’s analysis, one of us has estimated that there are
likely to have been 15 times more suicides on anti-
depressant drugs than reported by the FDA.10 Two
important reasons for the underreporting of suicides
are that the FDA trusted the data the companies sent
to them and that they only included events up to 24
hours after the randomised phase was over.10
We did not plan for any sensitivity analyses related
to whether the randomisation and blinding methods
were adequately described, as we were very well aware
before we started our review that in the sort of trials
we would find, there would likely be very little or no
information about this. We reviewed trials in healthy
volunteers, which have a completely different purpose
than standard treatment trials, and the drug compa-
nies do not have any particular incentive to provide
details about how they blinded the drug and the pla-
cebo and how they randomised the volunteers in such
trials. Furthermore, we studied harms, not clinical
beneficial effects, as we included healthy people. It
would therefore be inappropriate to assume that

 trials that did not describe blinding and randomisa-
tion methods are less reliable than other trials.
Conclusions
Antidepressants double the occurrence of events in
adult healthy volunteers that can lead to suicide
and violence. We consider it likely that antidepres-
sants increase suicides at all ages.
