Abstract
Background: Mercury (Hg) has been suspected of causing autism in the past, especially a suspected link with
vaccinations containing thiomersal, but a review of the literature shows that has been largely repudiated. Of more
significant burden is the total quantity of Hg in the environment. Here, we have used the Avon Longitudinal Study
of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) to test whether prenatal exposure from total maternal blood Hg in the first
half of pregnancy is associated with the risk of autism or of extreme levels of autistic traits. This is the largest
longitudinal study to date to have tested this hypothesis and the only one to have considered early pregnancy.
Methods: We have used three strategies: (1) direct comparison of 45 pregnancies resulting in children with
diagnosed autism from a population of 3840, (2) comparison of high scores on each of the four autistic traits within
the population at risk (n~2800), and (3) indirect measures of association of these outcomes with proxies for
increased Hg levels such as frequency of fish consumption and exposure to dental amalgam (n > 8000). Logistic
regression adjusted for social conditions including maternal age, housing circumstances, maternal education, and
parity. Interactions were tested between risks to offspring of fish and non-fish eaters.
Results: There was no suggestion of an adverse effect of total prenatal blood Hg levels on diagnosed autism (AOR
0.89; 95% CI 0.65, 1.22) per SD of Hg (P = 0.485). The only indication of adverse effects concerned a measure of poor
social cognition when the mother ate no fish, where the AOR was 1.63 [95% CI 1.02, 2.62] per SD of Hg (P = 0.041),
significantly different from the association among the offspring of fish-eaters (AOR = 0.74 [95% CI 0.41, 1.35]).
Conclusion: In conclusion, our study identifies no adverse effect of prenatal total blood Hg on autism or autistic
traits provided the mother ate fish. Although these results should be confirmed in other populations, accumulating
evidence substantiates the recommendation to eat fish during pregnancy.

Background
The possible link between Hg exposure and autism has
attracted much controversy and debate over many years,
largely related to suggestions that the Hg containing the
additive thiomersal (thimerosal) in immunizations was
causing harm (e.g., [1]). Reviews of the literature of ac-
cumulated evidence have since indicated a lack of associ-
ation [2–4], and these have gradually reduced the
general fear of having the baby immunized. In actual
fact, the amount of Hg in thiomersal was relatively low
compared with the amount absorbed from the atmos-
phere, the diet, and dental amalgam [5]. Nevertheless,
there is still a fear concerning exposure to mercury
among pregnant women, particularly focused around the
consumption of seafood [6].
Although there are undoubtedly severe adverse effects
with exposure to very high levels of mercury, prospective
studies (summarized in the “Discussion” section of this
paper) have mostly shown no adverse effects at a
population level. Nevertheless, there is still confusion
worldwide between the possible adverse effects on the
offspring of low levels of mercury in pregnancy, espe-
cially when the exposure is from seafood. We have car-
ried out a series of studies that have compared the levels

 of total mercury in maternal prenatal blood and shown
that among children born to mothers who ate fish, there
were no adverse associations with outcomes such as
child development, child behavior, high blood pressure,
or suboptimal IQ level [7–10].
Methods
The aim
Since there have been relatively few studies determining
whether there is any association between total prenatal
Hg exposure during pregnancy and autism, we have used
a large population-based study in England, to determine
whether (1) maternal prenatal whole blood Hg levels or
(2) indirect measures of fetal exposure to Hg were asso-
ciated with either a diagnosis of autism or the compo-
nent traits of autism.
The population
Avon
Longitudinal
Study
of
Parents
and
Children
(ALSPAC) is a pre-birth cohort study that enrolled ~ 80%
of pregnant women resident in the Avon area of the UK
in 1991–1992. The aim of the study was to assess ways in
which the environment (defined in its broadest sense)
interacted with genetics to influence the health, develop-
ment, and well-being of the offspring. To this end, data
collection used a variety of methodologies including direct
examination of the offspring; self-completion question-
naires administered to the parents, the children, and their
teachers; collection and assays of biological samples
(including DNA); and linkage to health and education
records [11, 12]. The study website contains details of all
the data that are available through a fully searchable data
dictionary: [http://www.bris.ac.uk/alspac/researchers/data-
access/data-dictionary/].
The exposures
Prenatal measures of total mercury
Blood samples deliberately collected in acid-washed con-
tainers for determination of trace metals were obtained
from 4484 women residing in two of the three Health
Authority areas of the recruitment region. Samples were
collected by midwives as early as possible in pregnancy.
The sociodemographic characteristics of the women
who donated samples were comparable to those of the
rest of the ALSPAC study population apart from includ-
ing a slight excess of older and more educated mothers
[13]. Gestational age at sample collection [known for
4472 mothers (99.7%)] had a median value of 11 weeks
and mode of 10 weeks. The interquartile range (IQR)
was
9–13
weeks,
and
93%
of
the
samples
were
collected at < 18 weeks gestation. Samples were stored
for 0–4 days at 4 °C at the collection site before being sent
to the central Bristol laboratory. Samples were transported
at room temperature for up to 3 h and stored at 4 °C
as whole blood in the original collection tubes for
18–19.5 years before analysis [14].
Analysis of the blood samples for whole blood Hg
were carried out by the laboratory of Dr. Robert Jones at
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
[CDC method 3009.1; unpublished information]. Clotted
whole blood was digested to remove all clots, before be-
ing analyzed using the inductively coupled plasma dy-
namic reaction cell mass spectrometry (ICP-DRC-MS)
[15, 16]. The entire amount of clotted whole blood was
transferred to a digestion tube using concentrated nitric
acid with the volume estimated from the weight. The
blood sample was heated in a microwave oven at a con-
trolled temperature and time, during which the organic
matrix of the blood was digested removing the clots.
ICP-DRC-MS internal standards (iridium and tellurium)
were added at a constant concentration to all blanks,
calibrators, and samples (at the time of 1:9 dilution of
digestate) to facilitate correction for instrument noise
and drift. The standard additions method of calibration
was used to optimize the analytical sensitivity of the
method for the whole blood samples. A recovery spike
was included in each analytical run for calibration verifi-
cation and as a blind quality control (QC) sample. The
ICP-DRC-MS was operated in the DRC mode using oxy-
gen when analyzing for Hg. QC materials as well as in-
house QC samples with control limits unknown to the
analysts were used for daily quality control. The level of
detection (LOD) for Hg was 0.24 μg/L; three samples were
below this level and were ascribed a value of 0.7 times the
LOD (since the frequency distribution of Hg had evidence
of a lower tail, a factor greater than 0.5 was deemed ap-
propriate to reflect the likelihood that more of these three
results would be closer to the LOD than zero). The mater-
nal blood Hg levels ranged from 0.17 to 12.76 μg/L, with
5th, 10th, 50th, 90th, and 95th centiles of 0.81, 0.99, 1.86,
3.33, and 4.02 μg/L, respectively.
Proxy exposure measures
We have shown elsewhere that the blood Hg level increased
if the woman ate fish during pregnancy [14] and with the
number of amalgam fillings in the mouth and whether she
had dental treatment involving amalgam during pregnancy
[17] (see Additional file 1). We have therefore analyzed
these variables as proxies for maternal Hg level.
The measures of fish consumption were obtained dur-
ing pregnancy and comprised three questions concern-
ing the frequency with which the mother ate (a) white
fish, (b) oily fish, and (c) shellfish. Options given were as
follows: not at all, about once in 2 weeks, 1–3 times a
week, 4–7 times a week, and more than once a day.
Dental exposures were also obtained from question-
naires completed by the woman in her own home and
posted back to the study. They comprised questions
Golding et al. Molecular Autism  (2018) 9:30 
Page 2 of 9
 concerning (i) whether she had an amalgam filling
inserted during pregnancy, (ii) whether she had an amal-
gam filling extracted during pregnancy, and (iii) approxi-
mately how many amalgam fillings were in the woman’s
mouth at the time she was pregnant.
Outcome measures
Autistic traits
We have used the four independent trait predictors of
autism identified previously as most predictive of autism
in this cohort and described in the Appendix. They in-
clude measures of social communication at age 7 (using
the Social and Communication Disorders Checklist
(SCDC)), coherent speech (using the Child Communica-
tion Checklist) at age 9, sociability (using the Emotionality,
Activity, Sociability temperament traits (EAS) tempera-
ment scale) at 3 years, and a derived repetitive behavior
measure at 5. Each has been shown to be an independent
predictor of clinically identified autism in ALSPAC using
health records [18, 19]. Since these continuous scales were
highly skewed and not easily amenable to transformation,
we dichotomized them in order to identify children with
approximately the worst 10% scores as described else-
where [20] (details also provided in the Appendix). These
extreme 10% subgroups of the traits are referred to as hav-
ing poor social cognition, poor coherence, poor sociability,
and repetitive behavior.
Identification of autism
In order to identify the children with autism, we used the
following sources: (a) a review of all children given a state-
ment for special educational provision in the Avon area to
identify children diagnosed as on the autism spectrum
using the ICD-10 criteria [18]; (b) the mother’s answer to
the question at age 9 “Have you ever been told that your
child
has
autism,
Asperger’s
syndrome
or
autistic
spectrum disorder”; (c) classification as Pervasive Devel-
opment Disorder using questions from the DAWBA ques-
tionnaire at 91 months [21], with the answers to the
questionnaire classified by a child psychiatrist; (d) text re-
sponses to any question on diagnoses given to the child in
questionnaires from 6 months to 11 years; and (e) letters
from parents to the Study Director with details of the
child’s diagnosis. We used all sources. We have previously
cross-validated ASD cases confirmed only by maternal re-
port by showing that they have strong associations with
various autistic trait measures [20]. This method identified
177 offspring (139 boys, 38 girls) with a presumed diagno-
sis of autism by age 11, giving a prevalence of 1.3%.
Confounders used in the adjusted analyses
The following factors collected using self-completion ques-
tionnaires during pregnancy were used as potential con-
founders in the analyses of autistic traits: maternal age,
parity (number of previous pregnancies resulting in a live
or stillbirth), family adversity index, housing tenure, house-
hold crowding, life events, smoking in pregnancy, and pre-
natal alcohol consumption. In addition, we took account of
whether the child was breastfed, as in our previous studies
[7, 10]. Although there were too few children with diag-
nosed autism to allow for a large number of confounders,
we have allowed for the key variables collected prenatally
that have influenced whether a diagnosis has been given;
these comprise mother’s age, education level, housing ten-
ure, time lived in Avon, and maternal locus of control.
Statistical analyses
There were two sets of analyses:
Analyses A comprised the assessment of maternal pre-
natal total blood mercury in regard to autistic outcomes.
Analyses B examined the associations between proxies
for mercury exposure (seafood consumption and dental
amalgam) and the autistic outcomes.
The five outcomes in both sets of analyses comprised the
binary measures involving the most extreme 10% of the
autistic traits as well as the children with diagnosed autism.
Logistic regression was used to assess the association be-
tween each of the five outcomes and (A) direct maternal
total blood mercury levels in pregnancy and (B) the proxy
measures indicating increased levels of blood mercury.
For adjustment using analyses A for the autistic traits,
the models first included the confounders outlined above
and then added the measure of mercury. In addition, since
we have shown interactions between prenatal fish con-
sumption and total blood Hg in predicting the offspring
IQ [7], we stratified by maternal fish consumption and ex-
amined the results for interactions between Hg levels and
whether the mother consumed fish, for each autistic trait.
Further analyses using proxies for Hg exposure in preg-
nancy (seafood intake and dental amalgam experience) ad-
justed for the same set of possible confounders but did
not look for interactions (see Table 4).
Results
Biases between the population for whom blood mercury
was available and the rest of the cohort
We have shown elsewhere that there were no differences
between the women for whom a trace metal result was ob-
tained and the rest of the population in relation to their
seafood intake [14], dental treatment [17], social conditions,
and lifestyle [9], with two exceptions: more educated and
older women were more likely to have had blood taken for
trace metal analyses.
Variation of diagnosed autism with prenatal whole blood
mercury
Of the 177 pregnancies that resulted in a child diagnosed
with autism, 45 had a measure of total blood Hg. The mean
Golding et al. Molecular Autism  (2018) 9:30 
Page 3 of 9
 blood level of Hg in this group [2.15 (SD 0.95) μg/L] was
similar to the level in the remaining 3840 pregnancies
[2.08 (SD 1.09) μg/L, P = 0.655].
Table 1 demonstrates the distribution of the pregnan-
cies within quintiles of maternal prenatal total blood Hg
(with the upper quintile divided into the two upper
deciles) by autism outcome. There was no evidence
for a trend of increasing prevalence with increasing
level of blood Hg, and the highest decile of the distri-
bution (> 3.39 μg/L) had one of the lowest prevalences of
autism (1.09% of children of women with the highest
levels compared with 1.34% of the children of women with
the lowest blood mercury levels were diagnosed with aut-
ism). The adjusted regression analysis for autism using the
five possible confounders (mother’s age, education level,
housing tenure, time lived in Avon, and maternal locus of
control) found no evidence of an association between
increased Hg levels and an autism diagnosis [adjusted OR
0.89; 95% CI 0.65, 1.22 per SD increase in Hg (P = 0.485)].
Associations of autism traits with prenatal blood mercury
The correlation coefficients [95% confidence interval]
between increasing maternal mercury level and in-
creasing level of autistic trait were as follows: social
cognition r = − 0.02 [− 0.06, + 0.02]; sociability r = − 0.04
[− 0.08, − 0.01]; coherence r = − 0.03[− 0.07, + 0.01]; and
repetitive behavior r = − 0.04 [− 0.08, + 0.001]. Thus, all
correlations indicated that with increasing levels of mer-
cury, the signs of autism were slightly less, but none were
statistically significant. It was also apparent from Table 1
that there was no evidence of an increasing prevalence of
any of the extreme levels of autistic traits with increasing
prenatal blood Hg. Table 2 shows the unadjusted and ad-
justed odds of total Hg levels with the dichotomized aut-
ism trait measures; the associations significant at the 10%
level are italicized. For poor sociability, there were many
significant unadjusted associations with Hg level, but only
one survived adjustment—and that was only of borderline
significance (P = 0.073); all the results indicated that high
levels of prenatal Hg were associated with reduced risk of
poor sociability. Neither poor coherence nor repetitive be-
havior was associated with prenatal Hg at the 0.10 level of
significance. The only adjusted association of statistical sig-
nificance at the 0.05 level concerned the relationship be-
tween Hg and poor social cognition among the offspring of
women who did not eat fish; this relationship was signifi-
cantly different from the women who did eat fish.
Associations with proxies of mercury level
Table 3 shows the prevalence of diagnosed autism and
the extreme levels of autism traits according to the fre-
quency with which the pregnant women ate white fish,
oily fish, and shellfish. No differences were apparent for
diagnosed autism or the repetitive behavior trait, but
children with mothers reporting eating no white fish ap-
peared to have the highest prevalence of impairments in
social cognition (16.1% vs 12.5 and 11.9%; P < 0.001) and
coherence (12.1% vs 9.4 and 9.7%; P = 0.026). There were
mixed findings for poor sociability.
In regard to dental features, poor sociability appeared to
show significant relationships, but all were such that in-
creased maternal exposure to dental amalgam was associ-
ated with lower rates of extreme levels of autistic traits.
Upon adjustment (Table 4), there were four significant as-
sociations at the 10% level; all indicated a protective effect
associated with the exposures that would have increased
the mothers’ Hg level (see Additional file 1).
Discussion
In this large birth cohort study with prospectively col-
lected information, we found no evidence to suggest that
prenatal exposure to total maternal blood Hg, measured

 directly in whole blood, and indirectly through fish
consumption and dental amalgam fillings, was associ-
ated with autism or increased autism symptoms in
the offspring.
There is increasing recognition that trying to find a
biological basis for syndromes such as autism is probably
best served by studying the component traits [22, 23],
on the assumption that particular component traits may
be influenced by different environmental and/or genetic
factors. Here, we have shown a differential relationship
between the social cognition trait and prenatal Hg ex-
posure, such that there was a significant difference in
apparently protective effects contingent upon whether
the mother ate fish. This was not found for the other
traits and may imply that this trait is particularly influ-
enced by the beneficial components of fish such as the
omega-3 fatty acids, iodine, and vitamins D and B2.
Comparison with the literature
There have been several reviews showing no adverse as-
sociations between autism and ethyl Hg in thiomersal,
but they have pointed out that the studies looking at
other Hg exposures tend to have concentrated on either
air pollutants or dental or dietary exposures but rarely
looked at Hg biomarkers [24, 25] apart from one study
of 84 cases of autism and 158 controls which showed no
difference in mid-pregnancy serum or cord blood Hg
levels [26]. Our study is consistent with these prior null
findings, with the additional advantage of being able to
assess the effect of direct as well as indirect measures of
Hg exposure on the diagnosis as well as on four different
autistic traits.
Although it did not consider diagnosed autism, a study
that bears the closest resemblance to our own analyzed
data comprising a longitudinal birth cohort in the
Seychelles where the consumption of ocean fish is
almost universal and the prenatal Hg levels are about 10
times those of the USA. Hair collected from 537
mothers shortly after birth was assayed for Hg, and
levels were assumed to be a proxy for prenatal Hg ex-
posure of the fetus. The study found no evidence of a
deleterious effect of these Hg levels or of fish consump-
tion with measures of social interaction or communica-
tion in the offspring [27].
Our findings of an interaction with prenatal fish
consumption are mirrored by a study of 2062 children
tested for IQ using the WISC at 8 years of age [9]; after
detailed adjustment, there was a difference of 3 IQ
points per SD of Hg between children of fish eaters
(+ 0.83) and non-fish eaters (− 2.22) (P = 0.043). This dif-
ference, and that with social cognition found here, sug-
gests that the benefits of nutrients in fish counteract any
possible adverse cognitive and behavioral differences that
may be caused by prenatal exposure to Hg.

extreme levels of autistic traits are shown together with the results of separate analyses for children of mothers who did and those

 Strengths and limitations
There are a number of limitations of this study: (i) Des-
pite the large sample, the numbers of autism cases with
prenatal total blood Hg measured were relatively low,
limiting statistical power. (ii) Although we accounted for
several important confounders which are relevant to Hg
levels and autism, the possibility of unmeasured con-
founding cannot be ruled out. (iii) The measures of Hg
were obtained from whole blood in the first half of
pregnancy—while having measures of Hg in early preg-
nancy may be a strength considering many teratogens
are known to affect development at this stage, it may
also be possible that exposure at later time points is
more deleterious in regard to the autism spectrum. (iv)
The data collected on fish consumption distinguished
between
oily
and
white
fish
but
did
not
further
characterize the types of fish consumed. Thus, we can-
not identify the mothers who consumed fish at the ex-
treme end of the food chain such as shark. However,
although the levels of mercury in these fish are consider-
ably greater than that in less predatory fish, there is no
evidence of harmful effects to the fetus from eating such
fish, as evidenced by the findings in this study of a lack
of increasing risk to autism or autistic traits with in-
creasing levels of maternal mercury. (v) The levels of
total blood Hg in this population may be different from
other populations, and therefore, caution is required be-
fore generalizing the results. For example, the median
total blood Hg level in ALSPAC was 1.86 μg/L compared
with 0.89 μg/L in the National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey (NHANES) in 1999–2000, but the

 recommended USA action level (5.8 μg/L) [28] was 8%
in NHANES compared with only 1% in ALSPAC [14].
(vi) The blood used for analysis had been kept in the
vacutainers in which they were collected for 19 years be-
fore assay. It is conceivable that some of the mercury
might have leaked through the rubber stoppers. How-
ever, this is unlikely to have been differential in relation
to the outcomes being studied and therefore could the-
oretically bias the relationship between maternal mer-
cury and offspring outcome towards the null. (vii) The
identification of cases of autism was not carried out
using a specific examination but rather used a multi-
source ascertainment approach; consequently, the possi-
bility of outcome misclassification cannot be ruled out.
Nevertheless, we have previously validated additional
cases identified against autistic symptoms [20] and have
also found that polygenic risk scores for ASD from the
most recent genome-wide association study with pub-
licly available summary data [29] are associated with the
ASD diagnosis identified in ALSPAC (paper under
review).
On the other hand, this study provides a number of
advantages: (a) it is based on a geographic population
with a high enrolment rate (~ 80%) and consequently
may be more generalizable to areas with similar distribu-
tions of blood Hg among pregnant women; (b) a rela-
tively large number of confounders were available to be
taken into account, thus diminishing the likelihood of
bias in the results; (c) the prenatal data were collected
prospectively with no knowledge as to how the child would
develop, again reducing the likelihood of possible bias; and
(d) sufficient numbers were available to allow comparison
between offspring of fish and non-fish consumers for autis-
tic traits (although not for diagnosed autism).
Conclusions
In conclusion, this study did not find evidence to suggest
that total prenatal blood Hg levels, or proxies for Hg
levels, were important in relation to offspring diagnosis
of autism. Although the results for the social communi-
cation trait mirrored results we have found for subopti-
mal IQ in showing an adverse effect of blood mercury if
the mother ate no fish, but a beneficial association when
fish was eaten, it is important that this be tested in other
populations. There is no consistent evidence from this
study to implicate prenatal exposure to mercury in the
etiology of autism.
This is the largest prospective population study to date
to address this question. It is the only study to compare
total blood mercury levels in the first half of pregnancy
among offspring with autism or high scores on autistic
traits. It is also the only study to determine whether the
exposures known to result in increased mercury levels
were associated with autistic outcomes in the offspring.

 developed on clinical samples, and when later used on the
ALSPAC population at age 7.7 years, the high end of the
scale was shown to predict a variety of adverse outcomes
but was most specific for autism spectrum disorder [31].
Further research with ALSPAC data showed that the meas-
ure was reasonably stable over time [32].
For the present analysis, we have used the prorated
score, which was calculated when any items were miss-
ing a response by using the average of the items that had
been answered by the individual (2.7% of the population,
almost all of whom had just one item missing). If all
items were missing, the score was put to missing. The
measure ranged from 0 to 24; the higher the score the
more impaired was the child’s social cognition. The dis-
tribution was skewed with a long upper tail. (12.8% had
a score of over 6 and comprise the abnormal group for
these analyses.)
The coherence measure
At age 9, the study mother completed a questionnaire
which included seven of the nine scales of the first ver-
sion of the Children’s Communication Checklist (CCC)
[33]. This checklist was designed to assess aspects of
communication that are not readily assessed by conven-
tional standardized tests including aspects of speech and
syntax, as well as pragmatic aspects such as over-literal
interpretation of stereotyped language. Although the
CCC was initially designed to identify pragmatic difficul-
ties, it has been shown to be good at discriminating a
wide range of language and communication problems
from typical development [34]. Analyses of traits pre-
dictive of autism in ALSPAC showed that the Coherence
scale performed better than the other scales [19] and
consequently it is used here. The scale comprises eight
items (e.g., “It is sometimes hard to make sense of what
she is saying because it seems illogical or disconnected”
and “She has difficulty in telling a story, or describing
what she has done in a sequence of events”). The score
ranged from 20 to 36, with higher scores indicating
more typical behavior. The score had a skewed distribu-
tion. The lower tail used in this analysis comprised those
children scoring ≤ 33 points (10.0% of the population).
Abnormal and repetitive behavior
This scale was developed from the answer to four ques-
tions in the questionnaire sent to the mother at 69 months;
these were as follows: “How often does he/she (a) repeat-
edly rock his head or body for no reason; (b) have a tic or
twitch; (c) have other unusual behavior”; or (d) “Does he/
she stumble or get stuck on words, or repeat them many
times? (e.g., I I I I want a sweet)”? The responses to each
question were coded as often/always = 3; sometimes = 2;
never = 1 and summed. The resultant scale had a range
from 4 to 12, with 22% scoring 5 and only 5.9% scoring
more than 5. Thus, it was impossible to approximate to a
10% cut-off; we therefore used > 5 as our abnormal group.
Sociability temperament
The questionnaire concerning the child sent to the study
mothers when the child was 38 months of age included
the 20 questions of the EAS temperament scale [35] and
measured four traits—emotionality, activity, shyness and
sociability—each based on the answers to 5 questions.
The range of the Sociability sub-score was from 5 to 25
and the frequency distribution was approximately nor-
mal, a high score indicating a high level of sociability.
The prorated scale was calculated for missing values as
in the scales mentioned above. We then selected the
lowest 11.4% of the children for our analyses (score < 8)
as being the nearest to 10%.
