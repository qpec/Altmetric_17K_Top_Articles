The effect of malaria and anti-malarial 
drugs on skeletal and cardiac muscles
Mauro Toledo Marrelli1,2* and Marco Brotto2
Abstract 
Malaria remains one of the most important infectious diseases in the world, being a significant public health prob-
lem associated with poverty and it is one of the main obstacles to the economy of an endemic country. Among the 
several complications, the effects of malaria seem to target the skeletal muscle system, leading to symptoms, such as 
muscle aches, muscle contractures, muscle fatigue, muscle pain, and muscle weakness. Malaria cause also parasitic 
coronary artery occlusion. This article reviews the current knowledge regarding the effect of malaria disease and the 
anti-malarial drugs on skeletal and cardiac muscles. Research articles and case report publications that addressed 
aspects that are important for understanding the involvement of malaria parasites and anti-malarial therapies affect-
ing skeletal and cardiac muscles were analysed and their findings summarized. Sequestration of red blood cells, 
increased levels of serum creatine kinase and reduced muscle content of essential contractile proteins are some of 
the potential biomarkers of the damage levels of skeletal and cardiac muscles. These biomarkers might be useful 
for prevention of complications and determining the effectiveness of interventions designed to protect cardiac and 
skeletal muscles from malaria-induced damage.

Background
Malaria remains as the most important human infectious 
diseases in the World, with around 214 million cases a 
year, and an astounding 438,000 deaths resulting from 
this disease alone [1]. About 3.2 billion people live in 
areas at risk of malaria. Populations of the poorest coun-
tries are the most vulnerable. More than 800 children die 
of malaria each day in Africa, according to a report of the 
World Health Organization [1] (one child every 2 min). 
In addition, non-endemic countries have reported hun-
dreds of imported malaria cases [2]. In 2013, 1727 cases 
of malaria were reported in the USA, and the US Armed 
Forces Command has named malaria as the number 1 
enemy, because of the high exposure levels of soldiers 
in the highly endemic areas where they are frequently 
deployed on a range of missions [3].
The human malaria is caused by five different species 
and Plasmodium falciparum can result in severe malaria 
and death if adequate treatment is not provided quickly. 
The pathogenesis mechanisms of several diseases caused 
by protozoan and nematode parasites have shown to 
cause detrimental effect on cardiac and skeletal muscles 
(i.e., Chagas disease, toxoplasmosis, trichinosis, leish-
maniosis, and malaria) [4–7]. Parasitic infestations by 
Trypanossoma cruzi, Toxoplasma gondii and Trichinella 
spiralis cause cardiomyopathy in the immunocompetent 
and immunocompromised patients. Besides those para-
sites, Plasmodium falciparum infection can also cause 
parasitic coronary artery occlusion [8].
Malaria pathogenesis is a process by which malaria 
parasites cause illness, abnormal function, or damage in 
their animal or human hosts. “Uncomplicated” malaria 
entails a series of recurring episodes of chills, intense 
fever, and sweating and often includes other symptoms 
such as headache, malaise, fatigue, body aches, nausea, 
and vomiting. In some cases, and especially in groups, 
such as children and pregnant women, the disease can 
progress to “severe malaria,
” including complications,

such as cerebral malaria/coma, seizures, severe anaemia, 
respiratory distress, kidney and liver failure, cardiovascu-
lar collapse, and shock [9–16]. Skeletal muscle is the larg-
est organ-system of the human body and, as expected, 
malaria significantly affects skeletal muscle function and 
metabolism. In fact, among the above-mentioned malaria 
symptoms, many of them can be attributed to dysfunc-
tion of the skeletal system. This article reviews the cur-
rent knowledge about the involvement of malaria disease 
and the anti-malarial drugs used in its treatment effect-
ing skeletal and cardiac muscles.
Malaria affecting skeletal muscles
The detrimental effects of the causing malaria agents 
on skeletal muscles in animals and humans are well 
known [11, 16–20]. The main pathogenic mechanism in 
severe malaria is microvascular sequestration of para-
sitized red blood cells, decreasing oxygen delivery, lead-
ing to obstructed blood flow and tissue hypoxia [20]. 
The skeletal muscle microvascular function and its oxy-
gen consumption is significantly impaired in malaria in 
the proportion of the disease severity and oxygen con-
sumption in severe malaria reduces similarly as in sepsis 
patients [20].
Several case reports have been published regarding 
malaria effects on skeletal muscles [11, 17]. Skeletal mus-
cle necrosis was reported in a patient with severe falci-
parum malaria, probably due to sequester of infected 
erythrocytes, 
causing 
microcirculatory 
obstruction 
[10]. Rhabdomyolysis, a serious syndrome directly or 
indirectly caused by muscle injury or death, can lead to 
complications, such as kidney failure due to intense myo-
globinuria, have been commonly reported in malaria 
patients [18].
The injured skeletal muscles has biomarkers relating 
with severity of falciparum malaria infection [16, 21, 22], 
and the sequestration of infected red blood cells has been 
pointed out as the cause for these processes. Pronounced 
deviation in normal serum levels of creatine kinase (CK) 
have been also reported in malaria patients, affecting 
skeletal muscles [16, 21]. CK is an enzyme involved in 
the synthesis and use of energy-providing molecules, and 
it is predominantly found in cells of cardiac and skeletal 
muscles. A longitudinal study suggested that falciparum 
malaria is associated with skeletal muscle damage that 
increases during the course of the disease and directly 
associates with abnormalities in CK levels [21]. In addi-
tion, the inflammatory characteristic of Plasmodium par-
asites increases cytokines levels (such as tumour necrosis 
factor, TNF) in combination with the formation of highly 
damaging free radicals [16], which could be considered as 
a potential important mechanism of damage and muscle 
weakness.
Much lower levels of RNA and protein contents were 
found in skeletal muscles (such as soleus muscles) than 
in non-muscle tissues of malaria infected rats and, when 
compared with non-infected rat controls [23], suggest-
ing overall increase in protein degradation or enhanced 
catabolism. Corroborating with these findings, Brotto 
et al. [19] demonstrated that in mice infected with Plas-
modium berghei, both the extensor digitorum longus 
(EDL) and soleus (SOL) muscles produced approximately 
half of the normal contractile force, fatigued signifi-
cantly more, and recovered significantly less from fatigue 
(Fig. 1). This study helped to begin the understanding 
of these detrimental effects of malaria on skeletal mus-
cles through the utilization of skinned muscle fibers that 
revealed direct effects on the contractile machinery itself. 
These effects were associated with significant decrease 
in content of key contractile proteins (reduced from 15 
to 45%) in the skinned fibers from malaria mice (Fig. 2) 
[19], in agreement with findings from other studies of the 
presence of muscle specific proteins in the circulation 
[16, 21–24]. It is important to note that malaria may also 
affect the activity of infected vertebrates, which may con-
tribute to some of the loss of muscle protein in less active 
rats.
Effects of malaria on cardiac muscle
Few studies have been focused on cardiac effect in severe 
malaria [25–27] despite serious symptoms of coronary 
complications have been observed in severe malaria 
patients. Although, few electrocardiographic reports 
of malaria patients have been published [28–33], their 
results have shown even some cases of deaths related to 
cardiac arrhythmias in severe malaria [32].
Circulation levels of cardiac proteins, such as troponin 
T (TnT), myoglobin and creatine kinase (CK), which 
are biomarkers of myocardial injury, increases with the 
severity of malaria, indicating myocardial impairment in 
complicated falciparum malaria [24, 25]. In a case–con-
trol study, myoglobin, CK, plasma levels of N-terminal 
pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) and heart-
type fatty acid-binding protein (H-FABP) were compared 
in 400 African children with severe and mild falciparum 
malaria, showing that children suffering from severe 
malaria and children who died due to malarial infection, 
exhibited high to very high levels of cardiac biomarkers, 
respectively [24]. In another case–control study with 
63 malaria patients showed that elevated levels of NT-
proBNP and H-FABP indicated myocardial impairment 
in complicated but not in uncomplicated falciparum 
malaria [25].
Cardiac troponin T is the most sensitive biomarker for 
detection of minimal myocardial damage [34]. Release of 
these troponins can occur when myocytes are damaged 
 Page 3 of 6

Malar J  (2016) 15:524 
by a variety of conditions such as inflammation, trauma, 
exposure to toxins and necrosis because of occlusion of 
a coronary vessel [35, 36]. Although severe, myocardial 
cell damages detected by high troponin T levels are rare 
events, as shown by a retrospective case study of 161 
stored sera of malaria falciparum patients [34].
By analyzing gene expression of cardiomyocytes treated 
with purified P. falciparum glycosyl phosphatidylinositol 
(GPI), which act as a toxin in the malaria pathogenesis, 
up-regulated genes related to apoptosis and myocardial 
damages were found, indicating that P. falciparum GPI 
can also induce cardiomyocyte apoptosis [37]. In the 
same study, a falciparum infected patient presented with 
heart failure with typical signs of cardiac myocyte apop-
tosis, suggesting that his complications could have been 
caused by the presence of this toxin.
Some case reports have also suggested an association of 
Plasmodium vivax infection and the appearance of car-
diac complications, with diagnosis of acute coronary syn-
drome, tachycardia, arrhythmia and myocardial failure. 
However, there is the possibility of anti-malarial therapy 
being the cause of these cardiac complications [38–40].
In a study using rodent malaria models, irreversible 
lesions were observed in several organs, including heart, 
of mice infected with Plasmodium chabaudi, Plasmo-
dium vinckei petteri and Plasmodium yoelii nigeriensis, 
following acute and chronic malaria [41].
Anti‑malarial drugs and their effects on cardiac 
and skeletal muscles
Treatment for malaria disease can only be initiated after 
making the correct diagnosis. Once made, appropriate 
anti-malarial treatment must be initiated immediately. 
Treatments are guided by three main factors: (i) the 
infecting species of Plasmodium, (ii) the clinical con-
dition of the patient, and (iii) the susceptibility of the 
parasites to the anti-malarial drugs determined by the 
geographic area where the infection was acquired and the 
previous use of the medicines.

Most anti-malarial drugs used are active against the 
blood parasite stages (the forms that causes the symp-
toms) and include mainly: chloroquine, mefloquine, 
quinine, quinidine, doxycycline, clindamycin and arte-
misinins. Widely-used anti-malarial drugs have a lim-
ited clinical lifespan due to increasing parasite resistance 
development. For instance, chloroquine, the drug of 
choice most used in Africa to combat malaria is no 
longer effective against the disease in several of the 
malaria endemic areas. Artemisinin-based combination 
therapy is currently the recommended treatment against 
falciparum malaria, in many parts of the world. However, 
there is serious concern that malaria parasites are devel-
oping resistance to this treatment. With parasite resist-
ance continuously rising, anti-malarial drug discovery 
requires strategies to decrease the time of delivering a 
new anti-malarial drug while simultaneously increasing 
the efficacy of existing treatments, developing alterna-
tive treatments [42], as well putting in place preventative 
measures, such as bed nets. In addition to causing serious 
whole body side effects, these drugs also have the ability 
to directly affect skeletal and cardiac muscles [43, 44].
Chloroquine is used in treatment and prophylaxis of 
malaria in areas where malaria is known to be sensitive to 
its effects. Prolonged administration of it can cause heart 
block and progressive myopathy [42]. It has also been 
reported as cause of toxicity, mostly in the retina [45, 
46]. Chloroquine is commonly used in the treatment of 
autoimmune disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis and 
systemic lupus erythematosus. Chloroquine increases 
the pH in lysosomal lumens, causing the disruption of 
lysosomal degradation of proteins [47]. Ikezoe et al. [44], 
demonstrated that chloroquine triggers the disruption of 
lysosomal enzymes, inducing amyloid-β accumulation 
and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Amyloid-β causes 
skeletal muscle fiber degeneration, activating autophagy 
in skeletal muscles of rats.
Cases of neuromyopathies and cardiomyopathies due 
to chronic chloroquine intoxication have been reported 
[48], in long-term therapies of autoimmune disorders 
(mainly in systemic lupus erythematosus) and during 
the use of chloroquine in malaria prophylaxis. Due to its 
lower toxicity comparing with chloroquine, hydroxychlo-
roquine is preferentially used today.
Quinine, a drug of choice in areas of chloroquine resist-
ance, can cause serious toxic effects, such as arrhythmia, 
angina and hypotension, circulatory defect and shock 
[15, 49]. Case reports of severe malaria patients present-
ing arrhythmia during a treatment with quinine have 
been published [50]. A fatal ventricular fibrillation was 
reported in a malaria patient, with no heart disease his-
tory, probably due to the toxicity of the administrated 
quinine during the treatment [51]. Although rare, the 
reports show that more attention has to be given during 
malaria treatment due to toxicity of quinine.
Another malaria drug, artesunate, has been used as 
alternative to treat malaria with minimal toxicity. How-
ever, it has been shown to affect airway smooth muscles, 
inhibiting the proliferation of human cultured airway 
smooth muscle cells, causing hyperplasia and hypertro-
phy [52], which leads to obstruction of the airways [53].
Conclusion
Long-term impacts of malaria include death, disability, 
and significant socioeconomic burden on societies where 
the disease is prevalent. A better understanding of the 
biological processes underlying the progression of infec-
tion to disease is urgently needed to reduce the morbidity 
and mortality of malaria.
As many diseases caused by protozoan parasites, 
malaria has shown to cause detrimental effect on cardiac 
and skeletal muscles [5–7, 11]. Malaria in humans leads 
to muscle weakness, muscle fatigue, respiratory distress, 
kidney and liver failure, and can lead to cardiac myopa-
thies. These severe complications can also be linked to 
skeletal muscle damage, besides the more readily recog-
nized effects on erythrocytes.
A hypothetical model is shown in Fig. 3, which predicts 
that malaria infection causes muscle damage due to the 
combination of ischemia, inflammation, and oxidative 
stress. Injured muscle fibers release significantly larger 
amounts of creatine kinase, myoglobin and other essen-
tial contractile proteins into the blood, such as troponins, 
which helps to explain how these proteins might leak into 
the bloodstream, and the associated muscle weakness 
and muscle fatigue in malaria patients. These released 
proteins/factors might create a feedback loop whereas 
they might lead to additional membrane and cellular 
damage. An intriguing possibility is that the early detec-
tion of these proteins in the blood of malaria patients 
could make them useful as biomarkers for muscle dam-
age caused by malaria parasites. Increased serum levels 
of proteins resulting from muscle damage may also help 
explain some of the damage to other organs such as the 
liver and kidney in these patients. In addition, the toxic 
effect of Plasmodium species, increasing cytokines lev-
els and free radicals could also be considered as potential 
mechanism of damage and muscle weakness. Together, 
this information could be used for improved monitoring 
of disease progression and development of specific inter-
ventions for the protection of cardiac and skeletal mus-
cles against the damaging effects of both the infection 
and the treatment.
Some of the findings reviewed in this article can help 
explain many of the symptoms in humans infected with 
malaria. Malaria infection induces a combination of

inflammation and oxidative damage in skeletal and car-
diac muscles leading to the enhanced degradation of key 
contractile proteins, which in turn is responsible for the 
compromised muscle function. Therefore, physiological 
key questions need to be answered: (i) What is the mech-
anism of direct damage to the contractile machinery? 
(ii) What are the genetic signaling pathways/networks 
regulating these modifications? (iii) Can these detrimen-
tal effects be counteracted with specific exercise training 
modalities, antioxidants therapy, dietary interventions 
or new drugs rationally designed to prevent the muscle 
damage?
These questions and many more and the large toll 
exerted by malaria clearly shows the need for investiga-
tion to determine the cellular and molecular mechanisms 
of malaria induced muscle damage.
