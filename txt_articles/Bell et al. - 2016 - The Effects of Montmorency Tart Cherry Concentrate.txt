Abstract: This study investigated Montmorency tart cherry concentrate (MC) supplementation on
markers of recovery following prolonged, intermittent sprint activity. Sixteen semi-professional,
male soccer players, who had dietary restrictions imposed for the duration of the study, were
divided into two equal groups and consumed either MC or placebo (PLA) supplementation for eight
consecutive days (30 mL twice per day). On day 5, participants completed an adapted version of
the Loughborough Intermittent Shuttle Test (LISTADAPT). Maximal voluntary isometric contraction
(MVIC), 20 m Sprint, counter movement jump (CMJ), agility and muscle soreness (DOMS) were
assessed at baseline, and 24, 48 and 72 h post-exercise. Measures of inflammation (IL-1-β, IL-6, IL-8,
TNF-α, hsCRP), muscle damage (CK) and oxidative stress (LOOH) were analysed at baseline and
1, 3, 5, 24, 48 and 72 h post-exercise. Performance indices (MVIC, CMJ and agility) recovered faster
and muscle soreness (DOMS) ratings were lower in the MC group (p < 0.05). Additionally, the acute
inflammatory response (IL-6) was attenuated in the MC group. There were no effects for LOOH and
CK. These findings suggest MC is efficacious in accelerating recovery following prolonged, repeat
sprint activity, such as soccer and rugby, and lends further evidence that polyphenol-rich foods like
MC are effective in accelerating recovery following various types of strenuous exercise.

1. Introduction
Prolonged, field-based, intermittent sprint sports are popular across the world at both elite and
recreational levels [1]. Sports, such as soccer, field hockey and rugby, require a high volume of energy
turnover and eccentric muscle actions resulting in metabolic and mechanically induced stress. Indeed,
soccer play results in elevated post-match inflammatory [2,3], oxidative stress [2,4,5] and muscle
damage [2,4] markers, as well as decrements in physical performance [2,4,5]. The Loughborough
Intermittent Shuttle Test (LIST), which closely simulates activity patterns, and the physiological and
metabolic demands of soccer [6], has been shown to incur similar stress responses [7–9], and, thus,
provides a tool to induce similar physiological stress to game-play, but in a controlled environment.
In light that athlete schedules require training or competition on multiple occasions within a few
days, the importance of recovery strategies when preparing for the next game or training session is

critical [10]. This is especially pertinent given that recovery is incomplete at 48 h following actual [2,11]
and simulated [9] match-play.
Montmorency tart cherries have been shown on numerous occasions to be of benefit in
exercise recovery [12–16], which have been proposed to be as a result of the high concentrations
of phytochemicals, and in particular, the flavanoids anthocyanins [14,17–19]. These compounds
can reduce oxidative stress and been shown to be a cyclooxygenase inhibitor (COX), to a similar
extent as NSAIDs [20,21]. A series of studies have investigated the use of Montmorency cherries in
influencing recovery from running [14,22], heavy eccentric contractions [15,16] and cycling [12,13].
Collectively, these lines of investigation suggest that Montmorency cherries could also be applied to
aiding recovery following high intensity concurrent sports that incorporate and very high metabolic
component that is accompanied by high intensity eccentric contractions.
Given that Montmorency cherries have been shown to be of benefit in exercise recovery following
high intensity eccentric contractions and metabolically challenging exercise, it makes the expectation
tenable that it could be applied to sports of a concurrent nature. Therefore the aim of this study was
to investigate the effect of Montmorency cherries on recovery indices following a protocol designed
to replicate the physiological demands of prolonged intermittent sprint activity such as those seen
in field based sports. It was hypothesised that MC supplementation would attenuate post-exercise
inflammatory and oxidative stress responses, and aid the return of functional performance.
2. Methods
2.1. Participants
Sixteen semi-professional (step 5 and above in the Football Association National pyramid, UK),
male soccer players (mean ˘ SD age, height, mass, predicted 9
VO2max was 25 ˘ 4 years; 180.8 ˘ 7.4 cm,
81.9 ˘ 6.6 kg, 54.9 mL¨ kg´1¨ min´1, respectively) volunteered to take part in the study. All procedures
were granted Ethical clearance by the University’s Research Ethics Committee prior to testing and
were conducted in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration. Inclusion criteria required participants to
have trained in soccer consistently across the preceding 3 years and be free of any lower limb injury
for the preceding 6 months. This was assessed through the completion of training history and health
screening questionnaires. Following both verbal and written briefings on the requirements of the study,
written informed consent was collected from all participants.
2.2. Study Design
A double blind, placebo controlled design with independent groups design was employed.
Participants attended the laboratory on six separate occasions across a period of no longer than
15 days (Figure 1). On visit 1, participants completed a multi-stage shuttle test [23] in order to predict
VO2max, which was followed by familiarisation with a battery of functional performance tests and
one 15 min section of the Loughborough Intermittent Shuttle Test Part A (LIST) [6]. Participants were
then randomly but equally assigned to either a Montmorency cherry (MC) or placebo (PLA) group,
matched by predicted VO2max score (54.3 vs. 55.4 mL¨ kg´1¨ min´1).
Participants returned to the laboratory for visit 2 within 5 days to complete the battery of baseline
functional measures that followed a standardised warm up; these were countermovement jump height
(CMJ), 20 m sprint time (20 m), MVIC of the knee extensors, agility (5-0-5), which were preceded by
assessment of active muscle soreness (DOMS). Participants were then provided with 24 MC or PLA
beverages in a double blind manner along with verbal and written instructions on how to consume the
beverages. They were also provided with a diet record diary and a list of foods to avoid throughout
the 4 days prior to and during the trial period. During the 4 day period leading up to the trial day,
participants were contacted and instructed to begin supplementation and dietary restrictions.

standardised warm‐up, participants completed a series of 12 × 20 m sprints with a 10 m ‘stopping 
zone’, departing every 60 s. This addition was included because (1) the LIST protocol does not 
account for the many bounding, leaping and directional changes that are associated with team 
sports play; and (2) previous work from our laboratory has shown only moderate responses with 
regards to the magnitude of stress response following the LIST [9]. A secondary adaptation to the 
LIST protocol was the completion of 6 × 15 min sections from the LIST Part A, as opposed to 5 × 15 
min sections detailed in the original protocol [6]. This section was included to standardise the 
distance covered by the two groups (in the original protocol, LIST Part B required a run to 
exhaustion, potentially resulting in group differences). During the LISTADAPT participants were 
provided with water ad libitum. 
 
Figure 1. Timeline of study protocol including visit requirements, sampling point and 
supplementation period. 
Visits 4‐6 took place at 24, 48 and 72 h following the start of visit 3 and required participants to 
complete the functional performance test battery outlined in visit 2. Venous blood samples were 
collected at baseline (prior to muscle soreness and performance test), immediately pre‐trial, 
immediately post‐trial and 1, 3, 5, 24, 48 and 72 h post‐trial for markers of inflammation, oxidative 
stress and muscle damage. 
2.3. Supplementation  
The MC or PLA supplementation was provided to participants after the initial visit along with 
instructions detailing the dosing schedule (30 mL twice per day, (8:00 a.m., 6:00 p.m.), 7 consecutive 
days (4 days pre‐ and on each trial day [13])). Supplements were prepared by mixing each dose with 
100 mL of water prior to consumption. The MC was a commercially available Montmorency cherry 
concentrate (CherryActive, Sunbury, UK); previous work from our laboratory has shown that the 
MC used in this study contains a total anthocyanin content of 73.5 mg∙L−1 of cyanidin‐3‐glucoside, a 
total phenolic content of 178.8 gallic acid equivalent∙L−1 and an antioxidant capacity (TEAC) of 0.58 
trolox equivalents∙L−1 [24]. A commercially available, less than 5% fruit, cordial, mixed with water 
and maltodextrin (MyProtein Ltd, Northwich, UK) until matched for energy content of the MC (102 
kcal) was used for the PLA supplement. All supplements were prepared by an independent member 
of the department prepared in opaque bottles in order to maintain the double blind design.

Visits 3–6 commenced at 8:00 a.m. in order to account for diurnal variation. On visit 3, participants
were required to complete an adapted version of the LIST (LISTADAPT). Following the standardised
warm-up, participants completed a series of 12 ˆ 20 m sprints with a 10 m ‘stopping zone’, departing
every 60 s. This addition was included because (1) the LIST protocol does not account for the many
bounding, leaping and directional changes that are associated with team sports play; and (2) previous
work from our laboratory has shown only moderate responses with regards to the magnitude of stress
response following the LIST [9]. A secondary adaptation to the LIST protocol was the completion of
6 ˆ 15 min sections from the LIST Part A, as opposed to 5 ˆ 15 min sections detailed in the original
protocol [6]. This section was included to standardise the distance covered by the two groups (in the
original protocol, LIST Part B required a run to exhaustion, potentially resulting in group differences).
During the LISTADAPT participants were provided with water ad libitum.
Visits 4–6 took place at 24, 48 and 72 h following the start of visit 3 and required participants
to complete the functional performance test battery outlined in visit 2.
Venous blood samples
were collected at baseline (prior to muscle soreness and performance test), immediately pre-trial,
immediately post-trial and 1, 3, 5, 24, 48 and 72 h post-trial for markers of inflammation, oxidative
stress and muscle damage.
2.3. Supplementation
The MC or PLA supplementation was provided to participants after the initial visit along with
instructions detailing the dosing schedule (30 mL twice per day, (8:00 a.m., 6:00 p.m.), 7 consecutive
days (4 days pre- and on each trial day [13])). Supplements were prepared by mixing each dose with
100 mL of water prior to consumption. The MC was a commercially available Montmorency cherry
concentrate (CherryActive, Sunbury, UK); previous work from our laboratory has shown that the MC
used in this study contains a total anthocyanin content of 73.5 mg¨ L´1 of cyanidin-3-glucoside, a total
phenolic content of 178.8 gallic acid equivalent¨ L´1 and an antioxidant capacity (TEAC) of 0.58 trolox
equivalents¨ L´1 [24]. A commercially available, less than 5% fruit, cordial, mixed with water and
maltodextrin (MyProtein Ltd, Northwich, UK) until matched for energy content of the MC (102 kcal)
was used for the PLA supplement. All supplements were prepared by an independent member of the
department prepared in opaque bottles in order to maintain the double blind design.

2.4. Dietary and Exercise Restrictions
Participants were instructed to follow a low polyphenolic diet in the 48 h prior to the beginning
of each MC or PLA supplementation and throughout the experimental phase of each study. A list
of foods to avoid was provided and compliance was assessed through the completion of daily food
diaries which has been successfully implemented in previous research [25]. This control measure was
used to provide a washout period of polyphenols to enable the efficacy of the phenolic-rich cherry
concentrate intervention. In addition, participants were instructed to abstain from any exercise that
was not a part of the protocol, throughout the same time periods. Lastly, participants attended all
exercise trials following an overnight fast. These measures ensured that dependant variable changes
from baseline were likely to be in response to the supplementation and the exercise trials implemented
within each study.
2.5. Functional Performance Tests
The functional performance test battery was performed in the following order on each occasion:
Active muscle soreness assessment (DOMS), 20 m sprint, 5-0-5 agility (CV 2.8% [26]), countermovement
jump (CV 1.9%), knee extensors (repeatability in Chapter 3.4). Timings were kept consistent throughout
all functional performance tests, each test was performed 3 times (excluding DOMS), with a 1 min rest
between repetitions and 3 min rest between tests.
Delayed onset of muscle soreness (DOMS) in the lower limbs was assessed using a 200 mm
visual analogue scale (VAS) with ‘no soreness’ at one end and ‘unbearably painful’ at the other.
On each occasion the VAS was used, participants were instructed to place their hands on hips, squat
down to ~90˝, before standing up and immediately making a mark on the scale consistent with their
perceived soreness.
Sprint performance (20 m; coefficient of variation (CV) 0.9%) and the 5-0-5 agility test [27,28]
(CV 2.8%) were assessed using wireless telemetry and infra-red timing gates (Brower Timing Systems,
Draper, UT, USA) on an indoor athletics track. Countermovement jump height (CV 1.9%) was assessed
using a jump mat (Just Jump, Probotics Inc., Huntsville, AL, USA); participants were instructed to
stand on the jump mat with their feet parallel and approximately shoulder width apart. Following this,
participants completed a maximal vertical jump whilst maintaining hands on hips through flight and
landing. MVIC of the dominant knee extensors was determined using a strain gauge (MIE Medical
Research Ltd., Leeds, UK) using the methods described previously [13]. The peak performance from
each trial was used for data analysis.
2.6. Blood Sampling
Blood samples (35 mL) were collected from a forearm vein located in the antecubital fossa
region in order to assess for markers of muscle damage (creatine kinase [CK]), inflammation
(interleukin-1-beta (IL-1-β), interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), high-sensitivity
C-reactive protein (hsCRP)) and oxidative stress (lipid hydroperoxides (LOOH)) using previously
described methods [12,13]; intra-sample CVs ranged from 0.7% to 6.8%. Samples were collected into
serum gel, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) or sodium heparin treated tubes (Vacutainer®BD
UK Ltd., Oxford, UK). Samples were then immediately centrifuged (Allegra X-22 Centrifuge, Beckman
Coulter, Bucks, UK) at 2400ˆ g at 4 ˝C for 15 min before having the supernatant removed and stored
in aliquots. Aliquots were then immediately stored at ´80 ˝C and subsequently analysed for the
respective indices in each study.
2.7. Statistical Analysis
All data analyses were conducted using IBM SPSS Statistics 20 for Windows (Surrey, UK) and
are reported as mean ˘ standard deviation. All data was confirmed as parametric via a Shapiro-Wilk
test for normality. Differences between blood marker variables were analysed by using a group

(MC vs. PLA) by time-point (Pre-supplement, Post-supplement, 1, 3, 5, 24, 48 and 72 h) mixed model
ANOVA. Functional performance measures were analysed using the same model, however with four
fewer levels (Pre-supplement, Post-supplement, 24, 48 and 72 h). Where significant group baseline
differences were apparent (MVIC, CMJ, 5-0-5 agility, 20 m sprint, DOMS) results were normalised
to baseline values prior to subsequent statistical analysis. Mauchley’s Test of Sphericity was used to
assess homogeneity of data and where violations were present, Greenhouse-Geiser adjustments were
made. Where necessary, interaction effects were assessed using LSD post hoc analysis. Prior to all
analyses, a significance level of p < 0.05 was set.
3. Results
MVIC (Figure 2) showed significant time (F(1,4) = 6.586, p = 0.001, η2 = 0.320), group (F(1,2) = 19.445,
p = 0.001, η2 = 0.582) and interaction (F(1,4) = 8.970, p < 0.001, η2 = 0.391) effects when data was
normalised to baseline values. The decline in MIVC performance was not evident in the MC group
whereas as function had not returned to basal levels at 72 h in the PLA. The peak difference occurred
at 48 h where MVIC scores in the MC group were found to be 19% higher.

the 72 h post-trial period, although the CMJ decrease in the MC group was significantly attenuated at
24 h (5%, p = 0.022) and 48 h (6%, p = 0.017) versus placebo. Significant time (F(1,4) = 12.988, p < 0.001,

In order to identify any group differences in LISTADAPT performance, a comparison of sprint 
times during the LISTADAPT protocol was performed using Student’s T‐test. No group differences in 
LISTADAPT sprint performance were found (t = 1.511, p = 0.153). 
4. Discussion 
The main finding of this study was that participants supplemented with MC were able to 
maintain greater functional performance than PLA counterparts following prolonged intermittent 
sprint activity. More specifically, MVIC, CMJ, 20 m sprint and 5‐0‐5 agility performances were 
superior in the 72 h post‐exercise with MC (vs. PLA). In addition, DOMS and IL‐6 were lower in the 
MC group throughout the post‐trial period.  
The attenuated declines in muscle performance are consistent with the findings of previous 
studies investigating MC as a recovery aid [12–16] and additionally the magnitude of MVIC decline 
following the LISTADAPT was comparative to previous work utilising a similar protocol [29]. The 
MVIC performance was on average 17%, superior in the MC group (vs. PLA). MC supplementation 
also resulted in better (vs. PLA) CMJ performance at 24 and 48 h. Sprint times in both groups were 
slower in the 72 h post‐exercise period, however at 48 h the MC group was significantly faster. 
Agility (5‐0‐5) times were also faster in the MC group by an average of 3% across the 72 h post‐trial 
period. Interestingly, the MVIC results in the 72 h following exercise suggests MC supplementation 
abolishes declines in this performance measure—a result that has been previously reported [13]. 
These data support the idea that supplementation with MC protect declines in muscle function 
following strenuous exercise, specifically in activity akin to repeated sprint sports and games play 
such as rugby, soccer and field hockey. A reduction in post‐exercise IL‐6 suggests a lower acute 
inflammatory response to the exercise bout that might contribute to the performance differences 
between groups. The COX, prostaglandin, IL‐6 pathway, which are activated during the secondary 
inflammatory response to cellular disruption, has been associated with proteolytic and lipolytic

Lipid hydroperoxides were increased in the 72 h post-exercise period as indicated by a significant
time effect (F(1,8) = 5.973, p < 0.001, η2 = 0.289). Peak increases of 35% above baseline occurred at 5 h.
Although there was a tendency for higher PLA group values, no significant group or interaction effects
were found. A summary of variables is reported in Table 1.
In order to identify any group differences in LISTADAPT performance, a comparison of sprint
times during the LISTADAPT protocol was performed using Student’s T-test. No group differences in
LISTADAPT sprint performance were found (t = 1.511, p = 0.153).
4. Discussion
The main finding of this study was that participants supplemented with MC were able to maintain
greater functional performance than PLA counterparts following prolonged intermittent sprint activity.
More specifically, MVIC, CMJ, 20 m sprint and 5-0-5 agility performances were superior in the 72 h
post-exercise with MC (vs. PLA). In addition, DOMS and IL-6 were lower in the MC group throughout
the post-trial period.
The attenuated declines in muscle performance are consistent with the findings of previous
studies investigating MC as a recovery aid [12–16] and additionally the magnitude of MVIC decline
following the LISTADAPT was comparative to previous work utilising a similar protocol [29]. The MVIC
performance was on average 17%, superior in the MC group (vs. PLA). MC supplementation also
resulted in better (vs. PLA) CMJ performance at 24 and 48 h. Sprint times in both groups were
slower in the 72 h post-exercise period, however at 48 h the MC group was significantly faster.
Agility (5-0-5) times were also faster in the MC group by an average of 3% across the 72 h post-trial
period. Interestingly, the MVIC results in the 72 h following exercise suggests MC supplementation
abolishes declines in this performance measure—a result that has been previously reported [13].
These data support the idea that supplementation with MC protect declines in muscle function
following strenuous exercise, specifically in activity akin to repeated sprint sports and games play such
as rugby, soccer and field hockey. A reduction in post-exercise IL-6 suggests a lower acute inflammatory
response to the exercise bout that might contribute to the performance differences between groups.
The COX, prostaglandin, IL-6 pathway, which are activated during the secondary inflammatory
response to cellular disruption, has been associated with proteolytic and lipolytic processes [30] and
subsequently muscular performance could be inhibited. Seemingly, MC supplementation reduced
(but did not abolish) this process and allowed for greater maintenance of muscular performance in
the recovery period. Conversely, there were no group differences in hsCRP. This is unexpected given
that IL-6 is implicated as a signalling molecule for the expression of hsCRP [31,32]. We are unable
to resolve the discrepancy between IL-6 and hsCRP and therefore suggest further work is needed
to identify the mechanism by which MC might exert its anti-inflammatory responses in response to
strenuous exercise.
In contrast to previous work [12] that examined repeated days cycling exercise, there were
no differences in LOOH between groups. The obvious discrepancy between study findings may
be attributed to single versus repeated days exercise. Unlike Bell et al. [12], where repeated days
cycling exercise (metabolic challenge) were used, the current study investigated a single bout of
strenuous exercise that incorporated both a metabolic and mechanical exercise stress. Conceptually, the
accumulated stress response from repeated day’s exercise would be greater than a single bout, but
of course the modalities, cycling versus simulated concurrent exercise, pose very different exercise
challenges and hence the redox response may also differ considerably between exercise stimuli.
In agreement with previous work [16,22], the lower post-exercise DOMS in the MC group provide
further evidence for the protective effect of cherries. Despite this, previous work from our lab [13]
using MC has not shown this positive effect. This discrepancy may be attributed to the different modes
of exercise employed to induce stress. Whilst muscle actions during cycling are almost exclusively
concentric [33], the repeated sprints and decelerations during the LISTADAPT protocol in the present
study, place a heavy eccentric load on the same muscle groups and as a result are likely to incur
 Nutrients 2016, 8, 441
9 of 11
greater mechanical stress. Indeed, DOMS ratings from the present study were consistently higher
than those in the cycling studies [12,13]. In further support of this supposition, CK (an index of
cellular disruption following damaging exercise) was considerably higher than the aforementioned
cycling studies. However, the CK response reported in previous work [14,15] using protocols that also
incorporate a heavy eccentric component, showed no evidence for a protective effect of MC.
The high-intensity, prolonged, intermittent nature of soccer and other repeated sprint sports
places a high degree of both mechanical and metabolic stress [2], which is reflected by the increase in
the appearance of physiological stress responses in the present study. Whilst this is not the first study
to demonstrate accelerated recovery of functional performance with MC supplementation, it is the
first to do so following simulated games play and therefore represents an important wider application
of this intervention to aid exercise recovery in sports of an intermittent sprint nature, such as soccer,
rugby, field hockey and basketball. Collectively, there is a growing body of evidence suggesting
that MC has the ability to facilitate exercise recovery—perhaps by modulating inflammation and/or
oxidative stress. The exact mechanisms behind these promising data are not clear, so it seems prudent
to explore further; perhaps by using animal, cellular and molecular techniques to provide a greater
understanding of the application of MC and other phenolic-rich foods.
In summary, this study provides further evidence for the use of MC as a recovery aid. For the first
time, MC supplementation has been shown to accelerate the recovery of a number of functional
performance measures following prolonged intermittent sprint activity and suggest that some
dampening of the post-exercise inflammatory processes might be responsible. With regards to
application, the dampening of such responses could be highly advantageous in sports requiring
athletes to complete high volumes of training whilst ‘in-season’, or athletes competing in tournament
scenario’s that require multiple performances within a short time period and the ability to recover in
sufficient time is a challenge. Additionally, although dietary restrictions were imposed throughout the
study period, the results suggest that sports requiring sprinting or high intensity directional changes
might benefit from MC supplementation when playing schedules are congested and recovery time
is limited between games. Finally, the issue of modulating the post-exercise oxidative stress and
inflammatory response has raised concerns; insofar as these stressors are implicated in the adaptive
response. Although there is no evidence that the adaptive response is affected by functional foods,
this question should be addressed in order to determine if periodiation of these sorts of supplements
is warranted.
