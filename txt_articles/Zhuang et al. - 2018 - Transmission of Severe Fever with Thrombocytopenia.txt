We demonstrate maintenance and transmission of severe 
fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus by Haemaphy-
salis longicornis ticks in the larva, nymph, and adult stages 
with dissemination in salivary gland, midgut, and ovarian tis-
sues. The H. longicornis tick is a competent vector to trans-
mit this virus in both transovarial and transstadial modes.
S
evere fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) 
is an emerging infectious disease caused by SFTS virus 
(SFTSV), identified in China in 2009 (1) and subsequently 
in South Korea (2) and Japan (3). Symptoms of SFTS usu-
ally include fever, thrombocytopenia, and leukocytopenia; 
case-fatality rates are 10%–30% (1,4). SFTS is implicated as 
largely a tick-associated disease, supported by evidence that 
many patients had exposure to ticks before disease onset (1). 
The longhorned tick, Haemaphysalis longicornis, the most 
abundant human-biting tick species in most SFTS-endem-
ic areas of China (5), was found to harbor SFTSV (1,6,7). 
These studies suggested that H. longicornis ticks might be 
competent vectors for SFTSV transmission. Our study was 
designed to determine the role of the H. longicornis tick as a 
vector in maintenance and transmission of SFTSV.
The Study
We randomly allocated 90 female H. longicornis ticks 
from an SFTSV-free colony into 2 equal groups, experi-
mental and control. We injected the experimental group 
with SFTSV and the control group with phosphate-buffered 
 
saline (PBS). Seven days postinjection, we used 18 of the 
35 live SFTSV-infected ticks for the detection of viral 
RNA by real-time reverse transcription PCR (rRT-PCR) 
(online Technical Appendix, https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/EID/
article/24/5/15-1435-Techapp1.pdf); all showed positive 
results, confirmed by subsequent rRT-PCR and sequenc-
ing analysis. Twelve days postinjection, we dissected 5 
live ticks from the experimental group to detect SFTSV in 
salivary glands and ovaries by indirect fluorescence assay 
(IFA), which showed notable SFTSV-specific fluorescence 
(Figure 1, panel A). For the control group, none of the 19 
ticks tested by rRT-PCR had SFTSV RNA, and none of the 
5 ticks tested by IFA showed SFTSV-specific fluorescence 
(Figure 1, panel B). 
We then let the remaining 12 live ticks from both 
groups feed on naive Balb/C mice (4 ticks/mouse) until 
the ticks detached from the mice. The engorged females 
were harvested and maintained to lay eggs. We deter-
mined transovarial transmission of SFTSV by further 
testing of SFTSV RNA from eggs, larvae, and nymphs 
using rRT-PCR. A total of 15 pools of eggs laid by 5 in-
fected H. longicornis ticks (3 pools from each tick, each 
pool coming from a single female) were SFTSV RNA 
positive. In contrast, the egg pools from ticks of the con-
trol group were all negative. When hatched to larvae, 
20 of 25 pools derived from the infected H. longicornis 
ticks (5 pools from each tick) tested positive for SFTSV 
RNA; all 25 larvae pools of the control group tested neg-
ative (Table 1).
We further performed transstadial transmission of 
SFTSV by rearing larvae to adults. All remaining larvae 
were reared to nymphs and adults by feeding on 20 na-
ive Balb/C mice. We subjected 1 mouse to SFTSV RNA 
testing after it was bitten by each pool of larvae and the 
hatched nymphs and adults; we used the other mice for 
feeding multiple pools of larvae and the hatched nymphs 
and adults. We fed 3,195 larvae in the experimental group 
and 2,987 in the control group to engorgement and random-
ly selected and tested engorged larvae. We maintained the 
other engorged larvae for molting to nymphs. In all, 694 en-
gorged larvae in the experimental group and 652 engorged 
larvae in the control group successfully molted to nymphs

 Transmission of SFTSV by H. longicornis Ticks
(online Technical Appendix Tables 1, 2). The remain-
ing 569 nymphs in the SFTSV group and 527 nymphs in 
the control group were fed on 20 naive Balb/C mice; 453 
nymphs in the SFTSV group and 437 in the control group 
were fully engorged. We divided the remaining engorged 
nymphs into 5 replicate cohorts; 166 engorged nymphs 
(39% ± 6% standard error [SE]) in the experimental group 
and 155 (38% ± 5% SE) in the control group matured to 
adults (online Technical Appendix Tables 1, 2). The over-
all hatching rate of eggs and molting rates of nymphs and 
adults in the 2 groups were comparable.
All 25 engorged larvae pools (5 pools from each 
mother) in the SFTSV-infected group and none from the 
control group were positive for SFTSV RNA (Table 1). 
After the larvae molted to nymphs, 23 of 25 nymph pools 
from the SFTSV-infected group and none from the control 
group tested positive for SFTSV RNA. Similarly, all 25 en-
gorged nymph pools from the SFTSV-infected group and 
none from the control group were positive. When the sec-
ond generation emerged, we tested 50 adults (25 females, 
25 males) in each group for SFTSV RNA; in the SFTSV-
infected group, 44% (11/25) of the females and 36% (9/25) 
of the males tested positive, whereas all 25 females and 25 
males in the control group were negative. Positive samples 
were confirmed by identical sequences to that of the inocu-
lated virus strain.
A total of 83 naive Balb/C mice were infested by 
ticks (online Technical Appendix Table 3). All 3 Balb/C 
mice fed by the SFTSV-infected females were positive for 
exposure to SFTSV 1 week after the ticks detached. Of 
the naive Balb/C mice that were bitten by larvae from the 
SFTSV-infected group, 4 of 5 were positive for SFTSV 
RNA, as were 4 of 5 mice bitten by nymphs, 4 of 5 mice 
bitten by adult female ticks, and 3 of 5 mice bitten by 
male ticks; mice bitten by ticks from the control group 
were negative (Table 2). We used IFA to test serum sam-
ples from the mice collected before and 3 weeks after de-
tachment of ticks at different developing stages; all mice 
positive for SFTSV RNA demonstrated seroconversion 
against SFTSV (Table 2).
Three of 4 pools of saliva and hemolymph from the ex-
perimental group were SFTSV RNA positive. We selected 
5 females at random from each group to detect SFTSV in 
tissues by IFA. The salivary glands, midguts, and ovaries 
of the SFTSV-injected group displayed SFTSV-specific 
fluorescence (Figure 2).

 DISPATCHES
We observed a significantly higher level of viral load 
in second-generation eggs than in second-generation adults 
(p< 0.001 by Mann-Whitney U-test). We also found a sig-
nificantly higher level (p< 0.0001) of viral load in saliva of 
engorged second-generation adults than in saliva of unen-
gorged adults, indicating that SFTSV had multiplied.
Conclusions
We report the experimental maintenance and transmission 
of SFTSV in H. longicornis ticks. After microinjection 
of SFTSV, the virus disseminated in ovaries and salivary 
glands. Infected H. longicornis ticks could transmit SFTSV 
successfully in both transovarial and transstadial modes. 
The appearance of SFTSV in saliva and hemolymph sug-
gests that the virus circulates in the tick hemocoel and is 
expressed in saliva. In addition, naive Balb/C mice infested 
with experimentally infected adults, larvae, and nymphs all 
became infected, evidenced by both detection of SFTSV-
specific RNA and seroconversion. 
These findings, together with data on natural infection 
in the field (1,6), implicate H. longicornis ticks as com-
petent vectors for SFTSV. However, the evidence derived 
from IFA and rRT-PCR tests could not indicate that the 
virus is infectious. More efforts should be taken to demon-
strate the infectivity of SFTSV in the transmission cycle. 
H. longicornis ticks are widely distributed in the Asia–
Pacific region (8–12). Predominant hosts of H. longicornis 
ticks include humans, poultry, livestock, wild rodents, and 
birds (12–14). As displayed in mice in the current research, 
SFTSV is likely to be maintained through vertical and hori-
zontal transmission in ticks that infest these wild and domes-
tic mammals. This maintenance has been evidenced by an ex-
traordinarily high prevalence of SFTSV in sheep, cattle, dogs, 
pigs, and other animals (7,14). In areas where H. longicornis 
ticks are endemic, infested animals could be considered as key 
reservoirs in maintaining and transmitting SFTSV (15). The 
close contact between animals and their owners could pose 
another way of acquiring infection, in addition to tick bites.
