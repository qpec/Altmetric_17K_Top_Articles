Lead exposure at firing ranges—a review
Mark A. S. Laidlaw1*, Gabriel Filippelli2, Howard Mielke3, Brian Gulson4 and Andrew S. Ball1
Abstract
Background: Lead (Pb) is a toxic substance with well-known, multiple, long-term, adverse health outcomes. Shooting
guns at firing ranges is an occupational necessity for security personnel, police officers, members of the military, and
increasingly a recreational activity by the public. In the United States alone, an estimated 16,000–18,000 firing ranges
exist. Discharge of Pb dust and gases is a consequence of shooting guns.
Methods: The objectives of this study are to review the literature on blood lead levels (BLLs) and potential adverse
health effects associated with the shooting population. The search terms “blood lead”, “lead poisoning”, “lead
exposure”, “marksmen”, “firearms”, “shooting”, “guns”, “rifles” and “firing ranges” were used in the search engines Google
Scholar, PubMed and Science Direct to identify studies that described BLLs in association with firearm use and health
effects associated with shooting activities.
Results: Thirty-six articles were reviewed that included BLLs from shooters at firing ranges. In 31 studies BLLs > 10 μg/
dL were reported in some shooters, 18 studies reported BLLs > 20 μg/dL, 17 studies > 30 μg/d, and 15 studies BLLs >
40 μg/dL. The literature indicates that BLLs in shooters are associated with Pb aerosol discharge from guns and air Pb
at firing ranges, number of bullets discharged, and the caliber of weapon fired.
Conclusions: Shooting at firing ranges results in the discharge of Pb dust, elevated BLLs, and exposures that are
associated with a variety of adverse health outcomes. Women and children are among recreational shooters at special
risk and they do not receive the same health protections as occupational users of firing ranges. Nearly all BLL
measurements compiled in the reviewed studies exceed the current reference level of 5 μg/dL recommended by the
U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention/National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (CDC/NIOSH).
Thus firing ranges, regardless of type and user classification, currently constitute a significant and unmanaged public
health problem. Prevention includes clothing changed after shooting, behavioural modifications such as banning of
smoking and eating at firing ranges, improved ventilation systems and oversight of indoor ranges, and development of
airflow systems at outdoor ranges. Eliminating lead dust risk at firing ranges requires primary prevention and using
lead-free primers and lead-free bullets.

Background
Most attention in the area of human health and guns
has been rightly placed on shooting injuries and deaths
[1]. However, decades of evidence indicate that substan-
tial health risks are incurred by the shooters themselves
in the form of lead exposure and subsequent poisoning.
Indeed, as pointed out as early as 1994 by Ozonoff,
based on high blood lead levels (BLLs) of shooters, “…
firing ranges comprise one of the largest unregulated
sources of occupational or para-occupational lead expos-
ure for adults. The perils of firearms exist at both ends
of the barrel.” [2]. The past two decades have brought
substantial improvements in firing range environmental
oversight as well as analytical capabilities to detect lead
in humans, but literature evidence indicates that we fall
far short of human health safety criteria in firing ranges
of all types, and among occupational and recreational
shooters. This review fills a gap in the literature by com-
piling data from a broad range of recent studies of firing
range users, employees, and their families, including in-
door and outdoor ranges, in an attempt to document
and clarify risks by firing range use, setting, and shooting

 behaviour. The emphasis of this review is on BLLs of
shooters as a marker for adverse health effects among
members of the shooting population.
Shooting statistics
In the United States alone an estimated 16,000–18,000
indoor firing ranges exist which employ tens of thou-
sands of employees [3]. An estimated 1 million law en-
forcement officers train at indoor firing ranges [3]. In
2011 there were approximately 270 million civilian-
owned firearms owners in the US and in 2007 there
were approximately 650 million civilian-owned weapons
globally [4] and 200 million firearms owned by nation
states worldwide [5]. In the United States approximately
20 million citizens practice target shooting as a leisure
activity [6]. The National Sport Shooting Foundation
(NSSF) [7] stated that in 2011 in the United States there
were 13,049,050 handgun shooters, 13,170,417 rifle
shooters, 9,713,033 shotgun shooters, and 3,730,567
muzzleloader shooters who participated in 156,790,412
handgun shooting days, 146,652,398 rifle shooting days,
113,866,661 shotgun shooting days and 29,042,237 muz-
zleloader shooting days. The global statistics regarding
the number of firing ranges and shooting prevalence are
not available, but it is likely there are a very large num-
ber of shooters at firing ranges. The United States Geo-
logical Survey (USGS) [8] calculated that in 2012 about
60,100 metric tonnes of lead were used in ammunition
and bullets in the United States. Given that the domin-
ant metal in bullets is lead, there are a large number of
people globally who are exposed to lead from shooting
at firing ranges.
Source of exposure from shooting lead bullets
There are several sources of potential lead exposure from
shooting guns and firing ranges. Most bullet projectiles
are made from lead, but a large amount of lead is also
present in the primer, composed of approximately 35%
lead styphnate and lead peroxide (and also contains bar-
ium and antimony compounds), that ignites in a firearm
barrel to provide the propulsion for the projectile [9–13].
A portion of the lead bullet disintegrates into fine frag-
ments while passing through the gun due to misalign-
ments of the gun barrel [9]. The lead particles, along with
dust and fumes originating from the lead primer and the
bullet fragments are ejected at high pressures (18,000–
20,000 psi; 124–128 mpa) from the gun barrel, a large pro-
portion of which occurs at right angles to the direction of
fire in close proximity to the shooter [9]. The shooter can
inhale fine Pb particulates (mainly from the primer) which
constitutes the proximal exposure pathway. Fine and
coarse particulates from both the primer and bullet frag-
ments also attach to the shooters hands, clothing, and
other
surfaces,
and
can
be
inadvertently
ingested,
providing another lead exposure pathway [14, 15]. When
changing targets at outdoor firing ranges shooters can be
exposed to lead that has accumulated in soil dust. Add-
itionally, the shooters can then bring these particulates
back to their home and expose their families as with other
lead occupational hazards.
Firing range personnel are employed by the shooting
galleries, and thus also receive proximal lead exposure.
They are also charged with cleaning the ranges and re-
moving lead particulates on floors, targets, and the ven-
tilation systems (for indoor ranges). Furthermore, they
work at firing ranges for extended hours during the
working week, compounding potential lead exposure.
Finally, although not the focus of this review, there are
environmental impacts arising from firing ranges. Emis-
sions in firing ranges result in the accumulation of ele-
vated lead concentrations in surface soils [16–18]. This
is concerning because lead particles do not naturally bio-
degrade in soil as do some contaminants such as hydro-
carbons. The half-life of lead in surface soil has been
estimated as approximately 700 years [19]. Therefore, if
not remediated following closure, lead contaminated
surface soils at firing ranges could result in lead expo-
sures for hundreds of years. Dust from lead contami-
nated soil can be resuspended into the atmosphere and
transported from a firing range whether outdoor or in-
door [20, 21]. Lead in soils and dusts at firing ranges are
highly bioavailable [22]. Lead in soil could weather/
oxidize
and
migrate
down-gradient
to
underlying
groundwater beyond the firing range boundaries [23].
The low solubility of lead in natural water (i.e., not min-
ing related), however, limits off-site aquatic transport.
The factors most likely to affect the amount of lead car-
ried by the groundwater in solution are pH, depth to
groundwater, soil chemistry, soil type and annual pre-
cipitation [24]. Soil-derived sediment discharged during
rain events from lead contaminated firing range soils has
the potential to migrate to surrounding properties and
into waterways through runoff or storm drains. Wildlife
[25–27], biota [28] and humans can be exposed to lead
contaminated soils, sediments and airborne particulates
near firing ranges. Bellinger et al. (2013) [29] provided a
consensus statement about the health risks arising from
lead-based ammunition in the environment.
Health outcomes associated with blood lead levels (BLLs)
In 2012, The United States National Toxicology Program
(NTP) published evidence regarding health effects asso-
ciated with BLL exposure in adults and children [30].
For adult men and women there is “sufficient evidence”
that BLLs <10 μg/dL are associated with essential
tremor, hypertension, cardiovascular-related mortality
and electrocardiography abnormalities, and decreased
kidney glomerular filtration rate. For women there is
Laidlaw et al. Environmental Health  (2017) 16:34

 “sufficient evidence” that BLLs <5 μg/dL are associated
with reduced foetal growth. For adult men and women
there is “limited evidence” that BLLs <10 μg/dL were as-
sociated with psychiatric effects, decreased hearing and
cognitive function, incidence of amyotrophic lateral
sclerosis, and increased spontaneous abortion in women.
For adults there is “limited evidence” that BLLs <5 μg/
dL were associated with incidence of essential tremor.
For children with BLLs <5 μg/dL there is “sufficient evi-
dence” of decreased academic achievement, intelligence
quotient (IQ), specific cognitive measures, increased at-
tention related behaviours, delayed puberty and reduced
postnatal growth. For children with blood lead levels <
10 μg/dL there is “sufficient evidence” of decreased hear-
ing. For children with BLLs < 5 μg/dL there is “limited
evidence” of an association of decreased kidney glomeru-
lar filtration rate, and delayed puberty. For prenatal expos-
ure with BLLs < 5 μg/dL there is “limited evidence” of
decreases in measures of cognitive function. For prenatal
lead exposure < 10 μg/dL there is “limited evidence” of de-
creased IQ, increased incidence of attention-related and
problem behaviors and decreased hearing. For adult men
and women there is “limited evidence” that BLLs between
15 and 20 μg/dL are associated with adverse sperm pa-
rameters and increased time to pregnancy in women.
There is “limited evidence” that BLLs ≥10 μg/dL are asso-
ciated with decreased fertility. There is “limited evidence”
that spontaneous abortion occurs in female partners of
men with BLLs ≥ 31 μg/dL. However, modern exposures
are orders of magnitude larger than early hominids [31]
with pre-industrial blood lead levels in humans estimated
at 0.016 μg/dL [32]. Bellinger (2011) [33] noted that ad-
verse health effects are continually being associated with
decreasing exposures.
Methodology
The search engines Google Scholar, Pubmed and Science
Direct were accessed for studies that provided informa-
tion about BLLs associated with firearms using the
search terms “blood lead”, “lead poisoning”, “lead expos-
ure”, “marksmen”, “firearms”, “shooting”, “guns”, “rifle”
and “firing ranges”. The literature regarding the health
effects specifically associated with shooting lead bullets
at firing ranges was also reviewed. Studies that reported
BLLs associated with shooters at firing ranges were com-
piled into Table 1.
Results - blood lead levels at firing ranges
The search identified 36 articles originating from 15
countries around the world published between 1975 and
2016 that included BLLs of shooters. Over half of the re-
ports were from the U.S. The articles describe BLLs of
law
enforcement
personnel,
high
school
shooting
coaches, and family members ranging from as young as
1-year-old to adult men and women.
Summary of blood lead levels reported
Data from collected studies reveals the widespread oc-
currence
of
BLL
by
occupational
and
recreational
shooters. The vast majority of these articles reported at
least one BLL that exceeded 10 μg/dL. About half of the
studies further reported BLLs exceeding 20 μg/dL (18 ar-
ticles), exceeding 30 μg/dL (17), and even exceeding >
40 μg/dL (15). Indeed, all 36 of the articles indicated
BLLs of shooters exceeded 2 μg/dL. Considering that the
geometric mean BLL of the U.S. adult population in
2009–2010 was 1.2 μg/dL [34], the BLLs among shooters
provide stark evidence of significant exposure, particu-
larly to recreational shooters who do not typically self-
screen for BLL. Several key characteristics about BLLs
and exposure variables arising from shooting are gleaned
from the literature.
Baseline and post-shooting blood lead level relationships
Several studies focused on before-after comparisons of
shooters, particularly shooters in military and police oc-
cupations, and found marked increases in BLL resulting
from firing range activities. Tripathi et al. (1989) [9]
measured BLLs in police cadets before, and 1, 2 and
5 days after starting shooting practice, and 69 days after
the start of shooting. At 69 days after the start of shoot-
ing, the BLLs of the cadets remained above baseline
levels prior to shooting. Rocha et al. (2014) [35] con-
ducted a study of BLLs of police cadets before a shoot-
ing course and 3 days after the cessation of the shooting
course. The mean BLL of cadets increased from 3.3 μg/
dL (95% CI = 3.0–3.6 μg/dL) before the course to
18.4 μg/dL (95% CI 16–21 μg/dL) 3 days after comple-
tion of the course. In all cases the BLL increased signifi-
cantly after the course (p <0.001). Within 3 days, the
BLLs of the course instructors increased from 3.6 μg/dL
to 22.1 μg/dL in one case and from 7.7 μg/dL to
18.3 μg/dL in another. Fischbein et al. (1979) [36] con-
ducted a study of 23 firearms instructors and reported
that the BLLs increased measurably after firearms train-
ing. Vivante et al. (2008) [37] reported a statistically sig-
nificant (p <0.001) increase in BLLs of 29 Israeli soldiers
from a baseline of 10.3 ± 2.0 μg/dL to 18.9 ± 3.6 μg/dL
six weeks after training.
Decline in blood lead levels after shooting events
Several studies provide insight into the decline in BLLs
following shooting events. Goldberg et al. (1991) [38]
observed that average BLLs in 7 firing range instructors
decreased from 45 μg/dL to 31 μg/dL 6 months after a
training event. George et al. (1993) [39] observed that
average BLLs in 52 small bore rifle recreational shooters

 declined from 54.7 μg/dL at the end of the indoor sea-
son to 33.1 μg/dL in 37 of the shooters by the preseason
of the following year. Smart et al. (1994) [40] observed
that average BLLs of 20 howitzer operators declined
from 20.1 μg/dL to 11.9 μg/dL in 12 operators 8 weeks
after ending the firing exercise. Tripathi et al. (1989) [9]
observed that BLLs of 7 outdoor firing range police ca-
dets had a baseline average of 6 μg/dL prior to commen-
cing shooting training and an average BLL of 15 μg/dL
at the end of training 5 days later. At follow up 69 days
after training, the average BLL was 9 μg/dL. Thus, the
results indicate that BLLs following shooting events can
remain elevated for a considerable time after cessation
of shooting, especially for participants with higher BLLs.
Association between blood lead levels and bullets fired,
caliber of weapon, copper jacketed or unjacketed bullets
and air lead levels
Several characteristics such as shooting frequency, cali-
ber of the gun, type of bullet, and air lead at firing
ranges have been studied. Each of these variables relate
to BLLs and can also be associated with environmental
issues at firing ranges.
BLLs and frequency of shooting activity
Most studies reviewed indicate a strong positive correlation
between the use frequency of shooters at firing ranges and
their BLLs. Madrid et al. (2016) [41] reported that BLLs
were higher (p <0.001) in individuals who participated in
greater than 12 shooting practice sessions per year (8.3 ±
2.4 μg/dL) compared with controls who shot less than 12
times per year (5.2 ± 2.5 μg/dL). Tripathi et al. (1989) [9] ob-
served a positive association between the total number of
rounds fired and BLLs (r = 0.84; p <0.02) and personal-
breathing-zone air lead levels (r = 0.92; p <0.001). Air lead
levels were also correlated with BLLs (r = 0.85; p <0.02).
Asa-Mäkitaipale et al. (2009) [42] reported a correlation be-
tween BLLs and bullets fired during the last month (r = 0.71;
p 0.001) and the past year (r = 0.55; p 0.012). Betancourt
(2012) [43] observed a linear relationship between air lead

 exposure and total number of rounds fired by caliber of
weapon used.
Blood lead and gun caliber
Relationships between BLL and caliber of firearms have
also been described. Demmeler et al. (2009) [44] ob-
served that the larger the caliber of the weapon, the
higher the shooters BLL. The following median BLLs
were reported: airguns – 3.3 μg/dL (range 1.8–12.7 μg/
dL); 0.22 caliber weapons – 8.7 μg/dL (range 1.4–
17.2 μg/dL); 0.22 caliber and large caliber handguns
(9 mm or larger) – 10.7 μg/dL (range 2.7–37.5 μg/dL);
and large caliber handguns – 10.0 μg/dL (range 2.8–
32.6 μg/dL). Demmeler et al. [44] also reported that
shooters belonging to the International Practical Shoot-
ing Confederation (IPSC) had the highest median BLL of
19.2 μg/dL. Additionally, studies indicated a positive cor-
relation between cumulative air lead exposure in firing
ranges and BLL of shooters [40, 45].
BLLs and copper jacketed vs. unjacketed bullets
Tripathi et al. (1991) [46] compared the BLLs in firearm
instructors using copper jacketed and non-jacketed bul-
lets. One shooting instructor exhibited BLLs of 24.0 μg/
dL and 22.0 μg/dL using non-jacketed bullets and
copper-jacketed
bullets,
respectively.
A
second
in-
structor exhibited BLLs of 14.1 μg/dL and 13.0 μg/dL
using non-jacketed bullets and copper-jacketed bullets,
respectively.
BLLs and air lead
Elevated BLLs especially arising from indoor firing
ranges are the result of the greater absorption of lead
from inhalation compared with ingestion and dermal ab-
sorption. For example, the amount of absorption of
ingested lead by adults under non-fasting conditions
ranges from 3 to 10% and in young children from 40 to
50% whereas inhaled lead lodging deep in the respiratory
tract seems to be absorbed equally and totally, regardless
of chemical form [47]. As shooting involves generation
of extremely fine particles and gases, the high rate of ab-
sorption logically results in elevated BLLs. Outdoor
ranges, presumably well-ventilated by natural flow and
large air volumes, do not necessarily prevent lead expos-
ure from shooting activities. The following sections dis-
cuss the implications of the results.
Discussion
The results in Table 1 must be evaluated in the context
of BLL recommendations, special need populations, air
lead measured at firing ranges, and prevention. The use
of ventilation to manage exposure at firing ranges and
prevent lead exposure of shooters is appraised.
Blood lead level recommendations from public and
occupational health communities
Several United States (US) governmental agencies have
developed recommendations regarding BLLs. The Cen-
ters for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) makes
health
recommendations
to
protect
public
health
whereas the National Institute for Occupational Safety
and Health (NIOSH) and the Occupational Safety and
Health Administration (OSHA) focus on worker health.
The trend for BLL recommendations has been declining
over
several
decades
since
regulations
were
first
established.
CDC and NIOSH
The CDC [34] makes the following statement regarding
recommended BLLs in adults:
“In 2015, NIOSH designated 5 μg/dL (five micrograms
per deciliter) of whole blood, in a venous blood sample,
as the reference blood lead level for adults. An
elevated BLL is defined as a BLL ≥5 μg/dL. This case
definition is used by the ABLES program, the Council
of State and Territorial Epidemiologists (CSTE), and
CDC’s National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance
System (NNDSS). Previously (i.e. from 2009 until
November 2015), the case definition for an elevated
BLL was a BLL ≥10 μg/dL. The U.S. Department of
Health and Human Services recommends that BLLs
among all adults be reduced to <10 μg/dL. The U.S.
Occupational Safety and Health Administration
(OSHA) Lead Standards require workers to be
removed from lead exposure when BLLs are equal or
greater than 50 μg/dL (construction industry) or
60 μg/dL (general industry) and allow workers to
return to work when the BLL is below 40 μg/dL….
OSHA Lead Standards give the examining physician
broad flexibility to tailor special protective procedures
to the needs of individual employees. Therefore, the
most current guidelines for management of lead-
exposed adults should be implemented by the medical
community at the current CDC/NIOSH reference BLL
of 5 μg/dL. Recommendations for medical manage-
ment are available from the Association of Occupa-
tional and Environmental Clinics, California
Department of Public Health, and the Council of State
and Territorial Epidemiologist (CSTE) Occupational
Health Surveillance Subcommittee.”
Council of state and territorial epidemiologists (CSTE)
The CSTE is an organization of member states and terri-
tories representing public health epidemiologists in the
United States. The CSTE [48] makes the following rec-
ommendations actions for various blood lead levels in
adults (Table 2):
Laidlaw et al. Environmental Health  (2017) 16:34 
Page 9 of 15
 Ideally, recommendation triggering immediate cessa-
tion of exposure at shooting ranges should not be based
on a single blood lead level measurement. The duration
of an elevated BLL over multiple BLL measurements
should determine the nature of the intervention. Current
public health recommendations call first for education
and attention to risk factors that can mitigate future
exposures.
Occupational health and safety administration (OSHA) and
the new science-based recommendations
For occupational shooters and firing range workers, the
U.S. OSHA Lead Standards require general industry
workers to be removed from lead exposure when BLLs
are equal or greater than 60 μg/dL, and allows them to
return to work when their BLL is below 40 μg/dL [34].
Based on the recommended BLLs by the CDC/NIOSH
[34], the CSTE [48] and the comprehensive compilation
of health effects of low level lead exposure by the NTP
[30], the OSHA regulation that allows workers to return
to work with BLLs greater than 40 μg/dL seems
nonsensical as a health risk avoidance guideline, and
should be lowered in line with the Council of State and
Territorial Epidemiologists (CSTE) recommendations, as
shown in Council of state and territorial epidemiologists
(CSTE).
Special needs of women and children
Lead exposure of women and children have special char-
acteristics that must be taken into account. The needs
relate to the effect of lead on future generations. For
women the needs are related to the effect of lead on the
developing fetus and post-natal exposure associated with
breast-feeding. For children the special needs for low ex-
posure are related to the extraordinary sensitivity of the
developing organs of children. These concerns indicate
the need for a margin of safety.
The special lead risks of women
The risk to women exposed to lead at firing ranges is of
particular concern because, once absorbed, a proportion
of the lead is deposited in the skeleton and more than
90% of lead in adults is stored in their bones. Bone stor-
age takes place because due to their similar ionic radius
and charge lead is substituted for calcium. Furthermore,
when a woman becomes pregnant the fetus requires cal-
cium and, depending on the dietary intakes, a proportion
of calcium is derived from remodelling of the bones.
Skeletal lead stores are released from the remodelling
exposing the fetus during critical development windows
[49–51]. Even modestly elevated BLL’s have been associ-
ated with serious neurological disorders such as autism
[52]. Lead released from a woman’s bones during preg-
nancy is associated with foetal developmental problems
[53]. Another consideration for female shooters is that
when their BLL becomes elevated, they can pass the lead
on to their children through breast milk [54, 55]. Given
the
known
lead
contamination
at
firing
ranges,
intending-to- conceive, pregnant women, and nursing
mothers should curtail exposure from shooting activities
(employed in the security, military and police, and recre-
ational shooters) and observe precautionary prevention.
Health risks related to children shooters
The CDC (2005) [56] reported that children (aged 7-18)
shooting bullets at multiple firing ranges in Alaska ex-
hibited highly elevated BLLs (see Table 1). Shannon
(1999) [57] reported that children (aged 14–16) who
were competitive marksmen exhibited an average BLL of
21.3 μg/dL (range 18–28 μg/dL). Blood lead levels ob-
served in children from shooting activities are within the
range known to cause long-term detrimental health ef-
fects [30]. Exposure of young females to lead is of par-
ticular concern because it is stored in their bones and

Health-related lead issues and law enforcement personnel
Law enforcement includes a number of services to pro-
tect and ensure the safety of citizens and the commu-
nity. The public requires law enforcement personnel to
be “calm, cool and collected” when in service conducting
their duties. However, the adverse health effects, espe-
cially on the nervous system that are associated with ele-
vated BLLs arising from firearm use are inconsistent
with these ideals.
Air lead levels at firing ranges
The OSHA 8-h air lead time weighted average (TWA)
action level is 30 μg/m3 and the OSHA permissible ex-
posure limit (PEL) is 50 μg/m3 [58]. The California De-
partment of Public Health Occupational Lead Poisoning
Prevention Program (CDPH-OLPPP) recommended 8 h
TWA PEL is 0.5 to 2.1 μg/m3 [59]. Based on this guide-
line, the CDPH-OLPPP states “At a PEL of 0.5 μg/m3,
95% of workers would have a BLL less than 5 μg/dL over
a 40 year working lifetime. At a PEL of 2.1 μg/m3, 95% of
workers would have a BLL less than 10 μg/dL and 57%
would have a BLL less than 5 μg/dL over their working
lifetime.” Wang et al. (2016) [60] conducted a review of
studies of airborne lead concentrations and possible ex-
posure at firing ranges (Additional file 1). Wang et al.
[60] found that the OSHA 8 h TWA PEL is exceeded in
many studies, and even more noteworthy, the California
PEL is exceeded in all of the studies. It must be noted
that the recommended PEL and action levels are not the
only paths to controlling lead exposures.
Biomonitoring and primary prevention
Kosnett et al. (2007) [61] recommend that: “individuals
be removed from occupational lead exposure if a single
blood lead concentration exceeds 30 microg/dL or if two
successive blood lead concentrations measured over a 4-
week interval are > or = 20 microg/dL. Removal of indi-
viduals from lead exposure should be considered to avoid
long-term risk to health if exposure control measures over
an extended period do not decrease blood lead concen-
trations to < 10 microg/dL or if selected medical condi-
tions exist that would increase the risk of continued
exposure.” A more conservative approach are the recom-
mendations by CSTE in Council of state and territorial
epidemiologists (CSTE). A critical issue is that biomoni-
toring is not primary prevention. Biomonitoring only as-
sesses the degree of exposure and potential health
damage after exposure has taken place. Primary preven-
tion requires curtailing lead exposure and maintenance
of air quality. Several steps have been proposed above to
minimize lead exposure. Recommendations to prevent
occupational lead poisoning by shooters are provided by
U.S. Government [62]. The recommendations appear as
topics in school rifle team programs [63].
One of the challenges in a biomonitoring program is
the frequency which shooters should have their BLLs
monitored.
The
Australian
organisation
Safe
Work
Australia has recently carefully made recommendations
for multiple scenarios of blood lead testing frequency for
workers exposed to lead in the work place [64]. Similar
BLL
testing
frequency
recommendations
could
be
adopted for shooters exposed to lead in occupational
settings such as law enforcement, military, security and
shooting range workers. Recreational shooters that shoot
frequently could voluntarily use these blood lead testing
frequency recommendations as a guide if they wanted to
protect their health.
Potential health risks from ‘take home lead’
In contrast to occupational environments where work
clothes should not be taken home, lead dust can adhere
to shooters clothes and potentially contaminate vehicles
and homes. The CDC (1996) [65] measured carpet dust
lead concentrations in FBI student dormitory rooms and
in 14 non–student dormitory rooms at a firing range
and training facility. They observed that student dormi-
tory rooms had significantly higher lead levels than
non–student dormitory rooms, suggesting that the FBI
students were contaminating their living quarters with
lead. ‘Take home lead’ has been described mostly for oc-
cupational settings [66–68] but given the fine particle
nature and lead concentrations of dust associated with
shooting, the ‘take home lead’ pathway of exposure from
shooting must be recognized and curtailed.
Prevention of lead aerosols with ventilation improvements
The air lead table from Wang et al. 2016 [60] (Add-
itional file 1) and the National Research Council [69] are
the only compilations of air Pb levels at shooting ranges
that were identified. Wang et al. do not discuss the ven-
tilation practices in the various studies that may account
for lower air lead levels. A 1975 NIOSH study found that
at all 9 ranges studied, the air lead guideline was
exceeded at the time (200 μg/m3) [70]. A 2009 NIOSH
review describes a case study on air lead exposure of law
enforcement trainees and reports that the mean airborne
lead concentration of >2000 μg/m3 was reduced by 94–
97% to 60–120 μg/m3 but this was still above the OSHA
PEL of 50 μg/m3. Commercial ventilation companies
claim they can meet guidelines (i.e. Camfil air filters) but
no published studies supporting this achievement at fir-
ing ranges were located.
There is a “lack of evidence” gap in the literature dem-
onstrating that ventilation systems can maintain air lead
levels at indoor ranges below the current OSHA (50 μg/
Laidlaw et al. Environmental Health  (2017) 16:34 
Page 11 of 15
 m3) or California (0.5–2.2 μg/m3) guideline. The litera-
ture gap raises questions about whether or not the
guidelines can actually be achieved, especially the Cali-
fornia guideline. Further, as discussed in Special needs of
women and children, meeting the guideline does not ne-
cessarily provide a margin of safety from lead exposure.
Primary prevention requires eliminating lead in primers and
bullets
Lead from projectile primers is a significant proximal
source of lead exposure and uptake. The development of
primers is described by Brede et al. [71]. During the 19th
century primers were composed of mercury fulminate;
however, the mercury fulminate was found to be too
toxic to shooters. In the early 20th Century, Dynamit
Nobel developed the primer SINOXID which was for-
mulated with lead and became a universal primer. By “…
the 1960s exposure of shooters and firing range supervi-
sors to lead reached intolerably high levels, as evidenced
by the elevated blood lead values [71].” Dynamit Nobel
developed SINTOX, a Pb-free (as well as Sb and Ba free)
primer [71]. However, the results of some tests of the
lead-free primers have proven disappointing, with sig-
nificant variations in ignition timing, peak blast pressure,
higher barrel frictions, and reliability in different climate
conditions, compared with their lead-based equivalents
[72]. The performance of lead-free primers are being
tested by the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) and
North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) to reduce
exposure of personnel to known lead sources [73].
Despite the critical observations, there is lead-free am-
munition on the market. SINTOX is NATO approved
and outlets for lead-free ammunition are available [74,
75]. Some states are taking the issue seriously and re-
quire lead-free (or non-toxic “NT”) ammunition at firing
ranges [76]. Widespread acceptance of the need to re-
place lead must take place, and until this happens one of
the most significant health risks to shooters will remain
lead-rich primers.
“Green bullets” have also been proposed as a preventa-
tive measure that could minimize lead exposure to par-
ticipants and the environment. These bullets consist of
copper rather than lead bullets. Bismuth has been pro-
posed as a substitute for lead bullets but its environmen-
tal health impacts are poorly understood [77]. It is clear
that firing lead-free bullets results in dramatic decreases
in airborne lead exposures at firing ranges [78]. The use
of copper-jacketed lead bullets does not appear to be a
solution to a reduction in lead exposure because it re-
sults in only minor reductions in BLLs (see Tripathi et
al. (1991, Table 1) [46]. The United States Department of
Defence (DoD) is aware of the health threat posed by
lead exposure from small arms [69] and efforts are
underway to test and replace lead in both primer and
bullets [73, 79].
Table 1 provides evidence-based information about the
BLL sensitivity of shooters to lead dust at firing ranges.
The major gap in preventing risk of lead exposure at fir-
ing ranges are the fundamental lead-bearing materials
used for the explosive power and bullet projectiles. Pri-
mary prevention requires eliminating all lead materials
in primers and bullets in order to end the dispersal of
lead dust at firing ranges.
Conclusions
Shooting lead bullets at firing ranges results in elevated
BLLs at concentrations that are associated with a variety
of adverse health outcomes and the topic of health risk
is an ongoing topic of study. Of major concern is the
number of women and children among recreational
shooters, who are not afforded similar health protections
as occupational users of firing ranges. Nearly all BLL
measurements compiled in the reviewed studies exceed
the level of 5 μg/dL recommended by the U.S. CDC/
NIOSH, and thus firing ranges, regardless of type and
user classification, constitute a significant and currently
largely unmanaged public health concern. Primary pre-
vention of this risk requires development of lead-free
primers and projectile bullets. Prevention includes better
oversight of ventilation systems in indoor ranges and de-
velopment of airflow systems at outdoor ranges, protect-
ive clothing that is changed after shooting, and cessation
of smoking and eating at firing ranges. The mismatch
between what is recommended for individuals by the
U.S. CDC is in stark contrast to the allowable levels for
occupational exposure, and there are no real systematic
biomonitoring programs for firing range users to meas-
ure cumulative health effects caused by persistent low
and even high-level lead exposure. Recreational shooters
and the general public are provided no legal protections
from lead exposures at firing ranges. In conclusion,
while the past two decades have brought substantial im-
provements in analytical capabilities to detect lead in
humans the literature evidence indicates that we fall far
short of human health safety criteria in firing ranges of
all types, and among occupational and recreational
shooters.
