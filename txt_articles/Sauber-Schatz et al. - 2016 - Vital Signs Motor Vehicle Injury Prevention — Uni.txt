Abstract
Background: Each year >32,000 deaths and 2 million nonfatal injuries occur on U.S. roads.
Methods: CDC analyzed 2000 and 2013 data compiled by the World Health Organization and the Organisation for 
Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) to determine the number and rate of motor vehicle crash deaths in 
the United States and 19 other high-income OECD countries and analyzed estimated seat belt use and the percentage 
of deaths that involved alcohol-impaired driving or speeding, by country.
Results: In 2013, the United States motor vehicle crash death rate of 10.3 per 100,000 population had decreased 31% 
from the rate in 2000; among the 19 comparison countries, the rate had declined an average of 56% during this time. 
Among all 20 countries, the United States had the highest rate of crash deaths per 100,000 population (10.3); the highest 
rate of crash deaths per 10,000 registered vehicles (1.24), and the fifth highest rate of motor vehicle crash deaths per 
100 million vehicle miles traveled (1.10). Among countries for which information on national seat belt use was available, 
the United States ranked 18th out of 20 for front seat use, and 13th out of 18 for rear seat use. Among 19 countries, the 
United States reported the second highest percentage of motor vehicle crash deaths involving alcohol-impaired driving 
(31%), and among 15, had the eighth highest percentage of crash deaths that involved speeding (29%).
Conclusions and Comments: Motor vehicle injuries are predictable and preventable. Lower death rates in other 
high-income countries, as well as a high prevalence of risk factors in the United States, suggest that the United States can 
make more progress in reducing crash deaths. With a projected increase in U.S. crash deaths in 2015, the time is right 
to reassess U.S. progress and set new goals. By implementing effective strategies, including those that increase seat belt 
use and reduce alcohol-impaired driving and speeding, the United States can prevent thousands of motor vehicle crash-
related injuries and deaths and hundreds of millions of dollars in direct medical costs every year.

Vital Signs: Motor Vehicle Injury Prevention — 
United States and 19 Comparison Countries
Introduction
In the United States, reducing motor vehicle crash deaths has 
been reported as one of the great public health achievements of 
the 20th century (1). Despite this success, motor vehicle crashes 
remain a leading cause of death for Americans aged 1–54 years 
(2). Each year >32,000 deaths and 2 million nonfatal injuries 
occur on U.S. roads (2). The purposes of this study were to 
describe motor vehicle death data for the United States and 
19 other high-income countries and to report seat belt use by 
seating location and the percentage of deaths that involved 
alcohol-impaired driving or speeding.
Methods
The number of country-specific motor vehicle crash deaths 
was provided by the World Health Organization’s (WHO) 
most recent Global Status Report on Road Safety (3). Data 
representing 97.3% of the world’s population were collected 
and validated by trained National Data Coordinators. To be 
included in the study, a country was required to have mem-
bership in the Organisation of Economic Co-operation and 
Development (OECD; http://www.oecd.org), meet the World 
Bank’s definition for high income (gross national income 
per capita ≥$12,736), have a population >1 million persons, 
and report the annual number of motor vehicle deaths and 
vehicle miles traveled. In addition, the difference between 
the country-reported motor vehicle crash death rate and the 
WHO-estimated rate could not exceed 1 death per 100,000 
population. The United States and 19 of the 34 OECD 
member countries met these inclusion criteria, including 14 
countries in Europe, two in Asia, two in the Americas, and 
two in Oceania.*

Data from 2000 and 2013 were used for analyses. Motor 
vehicle crash death rates were calculated per 100,000 popula-
tion, per 100 million vehicle miles traveled, and per 10,000 
registered vehicles. The percentages of crash deaths that 
involved alcohol-impaired driving and speeding were calcu-
lated. National data on seat belt use by seating location (front 
and rear) and country, were compared, when available.
Data on the number of deaths related to alcohol-impaired 
driving, reported seat belt use, and the number of registered 
vehicles were obtained from the Global Status Report on Road 
Safety (3). The U.S. estimates for seat belt use, based on obser-
vation of occupants in noncommercial vehicles at controlled 
intersections, and the number of deaths in 2013 were obtained 
from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (4,5), 
and data for Canada were obtained from Transport Canada’s 
National Collision Database (6). Data on the number of vehicle 
miles traveled and deaths related to speeding were obtained 
from the International Road Traffic and Accident Database,† 
which is maintained by the International Transport Forum, 
an intergovernmental organization within the OECD (7). 
Original data presented in kilometers were converted to miles.
Results
All 20 countries reported the number of deaths and front 
seat belt use; 19 countries reported the percentage of deaths 
related to alcohol-impaired driving; 18 countries reported 
rear seat belt use; and 15 countries reported the percentage of 
deaths related to speeding. From 2000 to 2013, the U.S. motor 
vehicle death rate decreased 31%, from 14.9 to 10.3 deaths per 
100,000 population (Figure). The average death rate among 
all 19 comparison countries declined 56% between 2000 
and 2013, from 10.0 deaths per 100,000 to 4.4 deaths per 
100,000. Each of the 19 comparison countries had a higher 
percentage reduction in their motor vehicle crash death rate 
than did the United States, ranging from 38.3% (Finland) to 
75.1% (Spain) (Figure).
During 2013, motor vehicle crash death rates from the 19 
comparison countries ranged from 2.7 per 100,000 (Sweden) 
to 6.5 (Belgium) (Table 1) with mean and median rates of 
4.4 and 4.1, respectively. The rate of motor vehicle crash 
deaths in the United States during 2013 (10.3 per 100,000 
[32,894 deaths]) was approximately twice the average rate of 
the comparison countries. In the United States, these deaths 
represented 1.10 motor vehicle crash deaths per 100 million 
vehicle miles traveled; in the comparison countries, this rate 
ranged from 0.54 (Sweden) to 1.22 (Japan and Spain), with 
a mean of 0.85 and median of 0.80 (Table 1). Among all 20 
countries, the rate in the United States (1.10) was the fifth 
highest, after Belgium (1.14), Slovenia (1.16), Japan (1.22) 
and Spain (1.22). The United States also had the highest rate 
of deaths per 10,000 registered vehicles (1.24); the rate in the 
comparison countries ranged from 0.44 (Finland) to 1.04 
(Belgium), with a mean of 0.68 and median of 0.66 (Table 1). 
The United States had the second highest rate of registered 
vehicles per 1,000 population in 2013 (828). In the compari-
son countries, this rate per 1,000 population ranged from 369 
(Israel) to 1,080 (Finland), with a mean and median of 670 
(data not shown).
Alcohol-impaired driving was involved in 31% of U.S. 
motor vehicle crash deaths. Percentages of crash deaths that 
involved alcohol-impaired driving across 18 countries report-
ing these data ranged from 3.2% (Israel) to 33.6% (Canada) 
(mean = 19.1%; median = 18.0%) (Table 2). Speeding was 
involved in 29% of U.S. motor vehicle crash deaths. In 15 
comparison countries reporting these data, the mean (28.8%) 
and median (29.0%) percentages were similar to the U.S., 
but ranged from 15% (United Kingdom and Ireland) to 42% 
(Finland). The United States tied with New Zealand for the 
second highest percentage of motor vehicle crash deaths related 
to alcohol impairment, and had the eighth highest percentage 
of speeding involved deaths (Table 2).
During 2013, 87% front seat belt use and 78% rear seat belt 
use were reported nationally in the United States (Table 2). 
Among comparison countries, front seat belt use ranged from 
86% (Austria) to 99% (France) with a mean of 94.1% and a 
median of 95.0%. The United States ranked 18th out of 20 
countries for front seat belt use. Among comparison countries, 
rear seat belt use ranged from 65% (Austria) to 97% (Germany) 
with a mean of 82.1% and a median of 84%. The United States 
ranked 13th in rear seat belt use among 18 countries reporting.
Conclusions and Comments
Although substantial progress has been made in reducing the 
number of motor vehicle crash deaths in the United States, 
motor vehicle crashes remain a serious public health problem 
resulting in >32,000 deaths and 2 million nonfatal injuries 
each year. Compared with 19 other high-income countries, 
the United States had the most motor vehicle crash deaths 
per 100,000 population and per 10,000 registered vehicles; 
the second highest percentage of deaths related to alcohol 
impairment; the third lowest national front seat belt use; and 
the lowest percentage decline in the rate of motor vehicle crash 
deaths between 2000 and 2013. If the United States had the 
same motor vehicle crash death rate as Belgium (the country 
with the second highest death rate), 12,000 fewer lives would 
have been lost in 2013 and an estimated $140 million in direct

medical costs would have been averted.§ Similarly, if the United 
States’ motor vehicle crash death rate was equivalent to the 
average in the 19 comparison countries, at least 18,000 fewer 
lives would have been lost and an estimated $210 million in 
direct medical costs would have been averted.§ And, if the 
United States’ motor vehicle crash death rate was equivalent to 
that in Sweden (the best performing country), at least 24,000 
fewer lives would have been lost and an estimated $281 mil-
lion in direct medical costs would have been averted§ in the 
United States in 2013.
When accounting for factors that differ across countries, 
including population size, vehicle miles traveled, and number 
of registered vehicles, the United States consistently ranked 
poorly among OECD comparison countries. This low rank-
ing is consistent with other cross-national motor vehicle 
injury research findings (8–10). Although it is difficult to 
identify and quantify the reasons for differences between the 
United States and the comparison countries, differences in 
policies and their enforcement, use of advanced engineering 
and technology, and differences in public acceptance and use 
of effective strategies have all contributed to reducing death 
rates in the best performing countries. The United States 
is highly dependent on transportation by personal vehicle. 
In 2014, there were 1.2 vehicles per licensed driver and 2.1 
vehicles per household in the United States, and the US share 
of world car registrations was 15.1% (11). Given this reliance 
on personal vehicles, and need to address safety issues without 
delay, bringing policies in line with best practices (e.g., related 
to child passenger safety, seat belt use, and alcohol-impaired 
driving), enforcement, infrastructure, vehicles, and technolo-
gies such as ignition interlocks and automated enforcement 
(cameras) could help narrow the gap between the United States 
and higher performing countries (3,12).
The complexity of improving road safety requires a broad 
view and more universal implementation and enforcement 
of existing effective strategies in the United States (12–14), as 
well as system-level changes in vehicle safety and transportation 
infrastructure (13). To maximize lives saved and injuries pre-
vented in the United States, increasing restraint use and reduc-
ing alcohol-impaired driving could have the most, as well as an 
immediate, impact. Each year approximately half the passenger 
vehicle occupants who die in crashes in the United States are 
unrestrained (N = 9,777 in 2013)(15). Implementing primary 
enforcement seat belt laws that cover occupants in all seating 
positions, and requiring the use of car seats and booster seats 
for motor vehicle passengers through at least age 8 years could 
increase restraint use and prevent injuries and deaths in the 
United States. During 2013, seat belts saved approximately 
12,500 lives in the United States (15). If restraint use was at 
100% in the United States, an additional 3,000 lives would be 
saved in a single year (15–17).
Each year in the United States, approximately 10,000 
persons die in alcohol-impaired–driving crashes (18). Several 
proven prevention strategies could accelerate progress in the 
United States (19,20), including publicized sobriety check-
points (21), ignition interlocks (a breath-test device connected 
to a vehicle’s ignition that prevents the vehicle from starting 
unless a blood alcohol concentration below a preset low limit is 
detected) for all convicted offenders (22), having lower blood

alcohol concentration limits, and maintaining and enforcing 
the minimum legal U.S. drinking age of 21 years (23).
In addition to effective interventions, there is an approach to 
road safety that began in Sweden and is gaining traction in the 
United States called Vision Zero (24). This is an aspirational 
vision that, in the long-term, seeks to eliminate death and seri-
ous injury on the road. Vision Zero starts with the premise that 
traffic injuries are not “accidents”, no loss of life on the road 
is acceptable, all humans make mistakes, and traffic injuries 
are preventable. In the Vision Zero program, responsibility for 
crashes and injuries are shared between the users of the road, 
who are expected to follow basic rules, and the so-called “system 
providers,” which include developers of road infrastructure, the 
automobile industry, and the police, who are responsible for the 
functioning of the system. Eighteen U.S. cities have adopted 
this approach and many more are considering implementing 
it. Additionally, several U.S. states and the Federal Highway 
Administration have embraced “Towards Zero Deaths,” which 
is based on the Vision Zero philosophy.¶
The findings in this report are subject to at least three limita-
tions. First, definitions and reporting of motor vehicle deaths 
vary by country. To limit these differences, countries with motor 
vehicle death rates that differed substantially from WHO’s 
estimated rates were excluded from the analysis. Second, legal 
definitions and reporting of alcohol-impaired driving, speed-
ing, and seat belt use also vary among countries. For example, 
in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Canada, driv-
ers are considered to be alcohol impaired when their blood 
alcohol concentration is ≥0.08 grams per deciliter (g/dL); 
whereas, in the other comparison countries, drivers have lower 
blood alcohol concentrations limits (0.02–0.05 g/dL). Also, in 
Canada, all provinces except Quebec have administrative laws 
penalizing drivers (e.g., 3-day license suspension, fine, or 3-day 
vehicle impoundment) with blood alcohol concentrations of 
0.05–0.08 g/dL (0.04–0.08 in Saskatchewan) (25). Finally, the 
United States is larger and more populous than the comparison 
countries and has a lower population density (rural roads have 
higher death rates) than most. Travel behaviors, transportation 
modes, and infrastructure also vary widely among countries. 
These differences might account for some of the differences 
in motor vehicle death rates; however, by reporting rates per 
100,000 population, per 100 million miles traveled, and per 
10,000 registered vehicles, it was possible to partially adjust 
for these differences.
Motor vehicle injuries are predictable and preventable, and yet, 
in 2013, 90 persons died every day on U.S. roads. Lower rates in 
other high-income countries, as well as a high prevalence of risk 
factors in the United States, suggest that the United States can 
make more progress toward reducing motor vehicle crash deaths. 
With a projected increase in U.S. crash deaths in 2015 (26), the 
time is right to reassess progress and set new goals. By implement-
ing proven effective strategies, the United States can save thousands 
of persons and hundreds of millions of dollars in direct medical 
costs from motor vehicle crash injuries and deaths every year.
Key Points
• In 2013, the United States motor vehicle crash death 
rate of 10.3 per 100,000 population had decreased 
31% from the rate in 2000; the average rate among 
19 high income comparison countries had declined 
56% during this time, nearly twice as much. The 
United States had the lowest percentage decline among 
the comparison countries from 2000 to 2013.
• Motor vehicle crash deaths are responsible for 
>32,000 deaths and 2 million nonfatal injuries per year.
• Compared with 19 other high-income countries, the 
United States had the most motor vehicle crash deaths 
per 100,000 population and per 10,000 registered 
vehicles; second highest percentage of deaths involving 
alcohol-impaired driving; and third lowest national 
front seat belt use.
• Despite proven measures in motor vehicle injury 
prevention, in 2013, 90 persons died every day on 
U.S. roads. Lower rates in other high-income countries 
suggest that the United States can make more progress 
in reducing motor vehicle crash deaths.
 
– If the United States’ motor vehicle crash death rate 
was equivalent to the rate in Belgium (the country 
with the second highest death rate), 12,000 fewer 
lives would have been lost and $140 million in direct 
medical costs would have been averted in 2013.
 
– If the United States’ motor vehicle crash death rate 
was equivalent to the average of the 19 comparison 
countries, at least 18,000 fewer lives would have 
been lost and $210 million in direct medical costs 
would have been averted in 2013.
 
– If the United States’ motor vehicle crash death 
rate was equivalent to the rate in Sweden (the best 
performing country), at least 24,000 fewer lives 
would have been lost and $281 million in direct 
medical costs would have been averted in 2013.
