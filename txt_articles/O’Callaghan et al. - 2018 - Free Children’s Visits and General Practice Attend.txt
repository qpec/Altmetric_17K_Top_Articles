Free Children’s Visits and General Practice Attendance
ABSTRACT
PURPOSE In July 2015, all children aged younger than 6 years gained free access 
to daytime and out-of-hours general practice services in the Republic of Ireland. 
Although 30% previously had free access, 70% did not.
METHODS To examine subsequent changes in service use, we retrospectively 
analyzed anonymized visitation data from 8 general practices in North Dublin 
providing daytime service and their local out-of-hours service, comparing the 1 
year before and the 1 year after introduction of free care.
RESULTS In the year after granting of free general practice care for children 
younger than 6 years, 9.4% more children attended the daytime services and 
20.1% more children were seen in the out-of-hours services. Annual number of 
visits by patients increased by 28.7% for daytime services and by 25.7% for out-
of-hours services, translating to 6,682 more visits overall. Average visitation rate 
for children this age increased from 2.77 visits per year to 3.25 visits per year for 
daytime services, but changed little for out-of-hours services, from 1.52 visits per 
year to 1.59 visits per year.
CONCLUSIONS Offering free childhood general practice services led to a dramatic 
increase in visits. This increase has implications for future health care service 
planning in mixed public and privately funded systems.

INTRODUCTION
V
isitation rates are influenced by the way health care is financed.1,2 
In the Republic of Ireland, 55% of all citizens do not qualify for 
state-funded, means-tested general practitioner care3 and thus must 
pay out-of-pocket fees (approximately US$50 to US$65) for each general 
practice visit.4
On July 1, 2015, all 440,000 children aged younger than 6 years in 
the Republic of Ireland were granted free access to general practice visits, 
regardless of parental income.5,6 This policy change allowed 300,000 addi-
tional children free visits to both daytime and out-of-hours care settings.6
The primary aim of this study was to use general practice electronic 
health records to analyze changes in daytime and out-of-hours service use 
since implementation of the new policy.
METHODS
We used anonymized retrospective visit data from general practice elec-
tronic health record systems. Ethical approval for the study was obtained 
from the Trinity College Dublin/Health Service Executive General Prac-
tice Training Scheme Ethics Committee.
Settings
We studied health care use in 2 settings: 8 daytime general practice ser-
vices and their local out-of-hours service, called NorthDoc. NorthDoc 
offers urgent general practice services outside of normal office hours from 
5 treatment centers in North County Dublin. It covers 140 participat-

ing general practices, including the 8 in this study.7 
Data pertaining to face-to-face general practice visits 
were collected for a 1-year period before the date of 
introduction of free general practice care (July 1, 2014 
to June 30, 2015) and for a 1-year period after that 
change (July 1, 2015 to June 30, 2016).
Data Collection
For daytime services, we sent all 140 practices regis-
tered with NorthDoc an e-mail inviting them to partic-
ipate if they used the electronic health record Socrates. 
Eight practices indicated their interest and thus were 
included in this study.
For out-of-hours service, we collected anonymized 
visitation data for the study period from NorthDoc’s 
central database. All 140 general practices are included 
in this data set.
Analyses
We analyzed differences in the number of patients 
making visits, for both those paying out of pocket and 
those seen free of charge, and their number of visits in 
the period before and period after the policy change 
using the χ2 test.
RESULTS
Table 1 shows general practice visitation data for both 
the daytime and out-of-hours settings. Comparison of 
the periods before and after the policy change showed 
significant increases in both numbers of patients and 
numbers of visits by children aged younger than 
6 years, in daytime and out-of-hours settings alike 
(P <.001 for all). Figure 1 shows changes over time in 
number of visits per month for this age-group.
Daytime Services
The number of children aged younger than 6 years 
who used the daytime general practice services at least 
once increased from 3,540 in the period before the 
policy change to 3,874 in the period thereafter (a 9.4% 
increase). General practitioners saw children this age 
for 9,789 visits in the former period and for 12,600 vis-
its in the latter period (a 28.7% increase). 
The average visitation rate for all children aged 
younger than 6 years rose from 2.77 (95% CI, 2.68-
2.85) visits per patient per year in the period before 
policy change to 3.25 (95% CI, 3.17-3.33) visits per 
patient per year in the period after policy change. The 
number of children having free visits almost tripled to 
3,347 during the latter period.
Out-of-Hours Services
A total of 9,898 children aged <6 years made 15,087 
visits to the general practice out-of-hours service in the 
period before the policy change, and 11,890 children 
made 18,958 visits in the period after. The difference 
equated to 20.1% more children seen at least once and 
25.7% more visits in the latter period.
The number of children seen free of charge more 
than doubled to 10,824 during the year after policy 
change. These children made a total of 17,290 vis-
its. The average visitation rate for all children aged 
younger than 6 years changed little, from 1.52 visits 
per patient per year to 1.59 visits per patient per year 
comparing periods before and after the policy change.
DISCUSSION
Introduction of free general practice care for all chil-
dren aged younger than 6 years led to a significant, if

predictable, rise in the number of children seen free 
of charge and a sharp fall in the number paying out 
of pocket. The out-of-pocket number did not drop to 
zero, however, as some parents used general practice 
services before completing the application process 
for free visits. Overall, 9% and 20% more children 
attended the daytime and out-of-hours services, respec-
tively, at least once in the year after the policy change.
Number of visits by children aged younger than 
6 years increased in both settings by more than 25%. 
After the granting of free care, the overall visitation 
rates for children younger than 6 years approached 
that of those seen free of charge before the policy 
change. Although both the daytime and out-of-hours 
services saw more patients of all ages in the period 
after the policy change, children aged younger than 
6 years accounted for a disproportionate increase in 
service use: 45% and 73% of the additional visits in 
the year after the policy change to the daytime and 
the out-of-hours services, respectively, were by chil-
dren this age.
The birth rate dropped by 3% over the study 
period8 and numbers of general practitioners 
employed in each setting were similar throughout the 
study. In addition, although seasonal variation was 
seen as usual (Figure 1), there were no notable disease 
outbreaks in North Dublin during the study period 
that otherwise might explain increased service use. 
Further research is needed to establish whether sever-
ity of medical issues changed when access was free 
and whether increased workload had effects on gen-
eral practitioners and patients.
Demand for general practice services is increasing 
worldwide, both in daytime settings9,10 and out-of-
hours settings.11,12 Equitable access should be a corner-
stone of any health care system, but making services 
available free of charge inevitably increases service use. 
In the Republic of Ireland, there are already indications 
that the general practitioner workforce may struggle 
to meet demand in the near future,13,14 so future plans 
to extend state-funded general practice care to all 
groups15 will require careful workforce planning.
