Abstract
Recent experimental animal studies have shown that fetal exposure to serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRIs) affects brain
development. Modern recording methods and advanced computational analyses of scalp electroencephalography (EEG) have
opened a possibility to study if comparable changes are also observed in the human neonatal brain. We recruited mothers using
SRI during pregnancy (n = 22) and controls (n = 62). Mood and anxiety of mothers, newborn neurology, and newborn cortical
function (EEG) were assessed. The EEG parameters were compared between newborns exposed to drugs versus controls,
followed by comparisons of newborn EEG features with maternal psychiatric assessments. Neurological assessment showed
subtle abnormalities in the SRI-exposed newborns. The computational EEG analyses disclosed a reduced interhemispheric
connectivity, lower cross-frequency integration, as well as reduced frontal activity at low-frequency oscillations. These effects
were not related to maternal depression or anxiety. Our results suggest that antenatal serotonergic treatment might change
newborn brain function in a manner compatible with the recent experimental studies. The present EEG findings suggest links at
the level of neuronal activity between human studies and animal experiments. These links will also enable bidirectional
translation in future studies on the neuronal mechanisms and long-term neurodevelopmental effects of early SRI exposure.

Introduction
Serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRIs) are used in the treatment of
major depressive disorder (MDD), anxiety disorders, and eating
disorders, all of which commonly require medical care during
pregnancy (Andrade et al. 2008; Hanley and Mintzes 2014). The
rate of use of SRIs during pregnancy has rapidly increased to
even 5–8% of pregnant women (Charlton et al. 2015; Dawson
et al. 2015). The SRI exposure has not been associated with salient
teratogenic effects (Reefhuis et al. 2015; Wemakor et al. 2015), and
there is a concern that untreated antenatal depression may ad-
versely impact the early development of the offspring (Gentile
2015; Hanley et al. 2015). The current guidelines hence support
the pharmacological treatment of severe maternal symptoms
to reduce their impact on the mother and offspring (Ray and
Stowe 2014; Gentile 2015). Recent clinical findings have, however,

 challenged the view that SRIs do not affect early brain develop-
ment (Hermansen and Melinder 2015; Man et al. 2015).
In this context, it is relevant to consider the rapidly accumu-
lating data from experimental neuroscience. The serotonergic
systems, including the SRI target serotonin transporter, are
now known to serve crucial ontogenetic roles during fetal
brain development (Nordquist and Oreland 2010; Bourke et al.
2013). These effects include, for instance, guidance of neuronal
migration and growth of neuronal networks (Borue et al. 2007;
Homberg et al. 2010; Kiryanova et al. 2013). An experimental SRI
exposure in utero is shown to distort cortical and subcortical
microstructures and function (Persico et al. 2001; Xu et al.
2004; Liao and Lee 2011; Simpson et al. 2011; Suri et al. 2015).
However, recent scientific debate on the early use of brain-
acting drugs has exposed the many challenges that arise
when attempting direct translation of cellular-level experi-
mental findings to the pharmacological treatment of human
infants (Durrmeyer et al. 2010). It has become apparent that
the translational bridges from experimental findings to
human infants should be more specific, and preferably be
based on translational comparisons at the level of specific bio-
logical mechanisms.
While the molecular and histological effects of SRI exposure
are not accessible in live human newborns, brain function
could readily be studied in the human infants as well. Animal
studies have reported clear effects of fetal SRI exposure on early
neurophysiological functions (Liao and Lee 2011; Simpson et al.
2011; Zhou et al. 2015), such as a reduced functional network con-
nectivity related to disorganized cortical histology (Simpson et al.
2011). Recent rapid advancement in the recording and analysis
techniques of newborn scalp electroencephalography (EEG) has
opened novel possibilities to directly assess functional cortical
connectivity, both between and within brain regions (Vanhatalo
et al. 2005; Tokariev et al. 2012, 2015; Räsänen et al. 2013). The cel-
lular-level mechanisms of these computational EEG features are
now understood (Engel et al. 2013; Hyafil et al. 2015; Sotero et al.
2015). Importantly, the recent basic science data suggest that
some detailed features, such as interplay between cortical layers
and the developmentally transient subplate circuitry, could be
studied by measuring specific cross-frequency interactions in
the neonatal EEG (Minlebaev et al. 2007; Colonnese et al. 2010).
Hence, the recent signal analytic advance has opened a potential
translational bridge between experimental animal work and
human EEG recordings even at the level of neuronal network
mechanisms.
Taken together, it is now well established (Borue et al. 2007;
Homberg et al. 2010) that the use of SRI during pregnancy may af-
fect molecular and histological development of the fetal brain,
which are also reflected in the early neuronal network functions.
It is as yet unknown, however, whether such effects could also be
seen in the human after in utero SRI exposure. We hypothesized
that novel measures of newborn electrical brain activity could
offer a translational bridge needed to benchmark human new-
borns with experimental studies at the mechanistic level. To
test this overall hypotheses, we set 3 aims: (1) to investigate
whether prenatal SRI exposure affects the newborn electrical ac-
tivity to a measurable degree, (2) to compare early and later neo-
natal EEG changes in order to distinguish EEG signs of neonatal
abstinence from longer-lasting developmental effects, and (3)
to assess whether these possible effects are related to the level
of maternal depression or anxiety. To achieve these aims, we
designed computational EEG analyses that reflect different neur-
onal mechanisms recently implicated in the preclinical experi-
ments on early SRI exposure.
Materials and Methods
Participants
Mothers were recruited from the Health Care Centers in Espoo,
Finland, during routine prenatal follow-up, or via advertising
in newspapers and public places. The inclusion criteria were:
ongoing pregnancy and SRI medication. Exclusion criteria were:
maternal antidepressive medication other than SRIs, use of anti-
psychotics or mood-stabilizing medication, diagnosis of bipolar
disorder, and substance abuse disorder. Infants born preterm
were excluded. A control cohort of 62 pregnant women with no
SRI was recruited via the same media and with the same exclu-
sion criteria. Recruitment lasted from January 2012 to June
2014. The study was conducted within the area of Helsinki Uni-
versity Hospital and was approved by the local ethics committee.
An informed consent was obtained from all mothers. All clinical
and neurophysiological studies, including EEG assessment, were
carried out blindly without knowing the exposure status of the
newborn.
Clinical Studies
Psychiatric Assessments of the Mother
We assessed perinatal baseline status in all women with SRI
medication (n = 22) and most (61%) of controls during the last
week (average 0.2 days; ±13.3 days) before delivery. A psychiatrist
(H.S. and O.M.) interviewed the mother and completed the
Research Version of The Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-
IV Axis I Disorders (SCID-I) interview. A consensus between the
2 psychiatrists on diagnosis was done after all interviews. Both
parents completed a self-questionnaire which contained infor-
mation on socio-demographic characteristics, smoking, alcohol
use during pregnancy, and medications. The medication was
also assessed in the interview. The severity of current symptoms
of depression (Beck Depression Inventory, BDI; Beck et al. 1961),
anxiety (Beck Anxiety Inventory, BAI; Beck et al. 1988), and harm-
ful alcohol use (Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test; Babor
et al. 2001) were evaluated using well-validated symptom scores.
Neurological Examination of the Newborn
Newborn neurological status was examined by a pediatric neur-
ologist (M.V.) at the average postnatal age of 1.3 weeks (Table 1).
This timing was considered to be beyond the period of acute
abstinence syndrome (Kieviet et al. 2013; Forsberg et al. 2014),
hence allowing a search for longer-lasting symptoms and their
association with the neurophysiological findings. Two well-
documented, structured assessments were used: Hammersmith
Neonatal Neurological Examination scale (HNNE; Dubowitz et al.
1999) and Modified Finnegan Neonatal Abstinence Scoring Sys-
tem (Finnegan and Kaltenback 1992). We calculated the 6 categor-
ies of HNNE Scores and the Total Score according to Dubowitz
et al. (1999). The HNNE categories (Tone, Tone patterns, Reflexes,
Movements, Abnormal signs, and Orientation and behavior) cor-
respond to different attributes of newborn neurology.
Neurophysiological Studies of the Newborns
EEG Recordings
We performed 2 EEG recordings in each newborn: the first within
a week after birth (Rec 1) and the second at about 2 weeks post-
natally (Rec 2). This allowed distinguishing the EEG reactions
related to the acute withdrawal of fetal SRI (Rec 1) from longer-
lasting EEG effects (Rec 2). The EEG signals were collected as
previously described (Videman et al. 2016) using NicOne EEG

 amplifier (Cardinal Healthcare/Natus, USA) and EEG caps with at
least 20 electrodes (sintered Ag/AgCl electrodes; Waveguard,
ANT-Neuro, Germany). The following polygraphic channels
were included for sleep state assessment according to standard
criteria (Andre et al. 2010): chin electromyogram, electrocardio-
gram, eye movements, and respiratory sensors. No hardware fil-
ters were applied to avoid distortion of EEG signals during data
collection. All EEG recordings were visually reviewed to exclude
clinically meaningful abnormalities, and we extracted epochs
of relatively artifact-free EEG signal during active sleep and
quiet sleep [QS; for more detailed description, see Supplementary
Material and Videman et al. (2016)]. These epochs were converted
to the standard European Data Format for further computational
analyses.
EEG Analysis
All computational analyses were quantitative and performed
using custom-made Matlab codes. See Supplementary material
for further technical details of the analysis pipeline (see Supple-
mentary Fig. 1). Most of the Matlab scripts used in our present
work are available in our previously published work (Videman
et al. 2016).
To evaluate the local cortical function, we examined 3 mea-
sures: First, the ability to generate and sustain local oscillatory
transients was quantified by measuring the frontal alpha bouts
(FA; Fig. 1A), a characteristic feature of neonatal EEG (Andre
et al. 2010; Videman et al. 2016). Second, the local integration be-
tween oscillatory frequencies was assessed by measuring phase–
amplitude coupling with nestedness coefficient (NC, Fig. 1B),
which is a robust measure to characterize cross-frequency inter-
action during spontaneous activity transients in the neonatal
EEG (Vanhatalo et al. 2005; Tokariev et al. 2015), and considered
to arise from a coordination of spatially overlapping but function-
ally distinct neuronal networks (Engel et al. 2013; Hyafil et al.
2015; Sotero et al. 2015). Third, we also measured the frequency
spectra at each electrode location to provide a benchmark for
the conventional spectral analyses.
To evaluate cortical function at a more global level, we
examined 4 measures that reflect different physiological me-
chanisms of brain network function: First, interhemispheric inte-
gration, or interhemispheric synchrony, was assessed with
activation synchrony index (ASI, Fig. 1C; Räsänen et al. 2013),
which is shown to be a robust sign of normally developing neo-
natal long-range cortico-cortical connectivity (Koolen et al.
2014). Second, global intermittency, which is conventionally
considered to be a sign of newborn EEG maturity (Biagioni et al.
2007), was estimated from objectively quantified interburst
intervals (IBIs, Fig. 1C) during trace alternant, the characteristic
EEG activity during QS periods. Third, spectral analyses of
individual electrodes were pooled together to obtain global
frequency-specific assessment of oscillatory brain activity.
Fourth, we supplemented our analysis by performing compre-
hensive computation of hemispheric asymmetries across the
whole frequency spectra. This was done to benchmark our data
with the recent literature that has suggested a differential asym-
metry in the anterior alpha activity in the offspring of depressive
mothers (Thibodeau et al. 2006; Field and Diego 2008; Diego et al.
2010; Goldstein and Klein 2014; Lusby et al. 2014).
Statistical Analysis
As the data were often not normally distributed (BDI, BAI, and
NCs), we performed all group comparisons using nonparametric
statistics: Fisher’s exact test, Wilcoxon signed-rank test (within
individual), Wilcoxon rank-sum test (between individuals), or
Spearman’s correlation coefficient. Analyses with multiple com-
parisons were controlled as described in detail before (Tokariev
et al. 2015).
Results
Clinical Characterization of the Mothers
Psychiatric Assessments
The psychiatric evaluations, background information on smok-
ing, alcohol consumption, and educational level of the parents
are summarized in Table 2. Mothers using SRI had more often a
current anxiety disorder (but not MDD), as well as a lifetime
diagnosis of MDD or anxiety disorder; these differences were
also reflected in the symptom scores at the time of delivery.
Breastfeeding was equally common in both groups (80%) at the
time of the EEG recordings and the clinical examinations. Infor-
mation about breastfeeding was not reliably available from
about one-sixth of the mothers (5 of SRI mothers and 9 of control
mothers).
SRI Medication
The prevalences of medications and average daily dosages used
were sertraline 6 (47.5 mg), escitalopram 6 (8 mg), citalopram 6
(17.5 mg), paroxetine 2 (30 mg), venlafaxine 2 (75 mg), duloxetine

 1 (60 mg), and mirtazapine 1 (15 mg). Four mothers reported SRI
polytherapy. Of 22 mothers with medication, 16 had medication
throughout pregnancy, 21 had the medication in the first and se-
cond trimester, 1 finished and 1 started it in the end of the second
trimester, and 4 finished it during the last 2–4 weeks before
delivery.
Newborn Clinical Findings
There were no significant differences in the perinatal clinical in-
formation between newborn groups, with only a marginal, clinic-
ally unremarkable difference in the cord pH (Table 1). There was
one outlier in 1-min Apgar (Apgar = 2) in the control group, but
though we excluded this outlier, the mean score for Apgar did
not differ significantly (controls: mean 8.6, range 5–10, SD ±1.07
and SRI: 8.7, 6–10, ±0.81, P = 0.64). We could not observe signs of
abstinence syndrome at the mean postnatal age of 9 days using
the Finnegan score (Table 3), which suggests that the acute SRI
withdrawal effects had tapered by that time. However, neuro-
logical examination at the same time showed significant differ-
ences between the groups, especially in the HNNE category of
“Abnormal signs or patterns,” which includes aspects of tremor,
hand and toe posture, and startle reaction (Table 3). The subscore
analysis showed that the newborns exposed to SRI had also more
tremors during wakefulness (P = 0.05).
Neurophysiological Studies
Local Brain Function
In the first EEG recordings, there was a significant difference be-
tween newborn groups in the local ability to sustain periodic os-
cillatory bouts. The mean length of frontal alpha bouts was
shorter in the SRI than in the control group (0.34 s, SD 0.06 vs.
0.44 s, SD 0.10, P = 0.005). This group difference was only transient
during the perinatal period (Rec 1), and it had disappeared by the
second EEG recording (Rec 2).
The measure of local cross-frequency integration (NC) was
different between newborn groups at the second EEG recording
time. The newborns exposed to SRI showed lower mean levels
of NC when compared with the control newborns. The direction
of difference between group means was consistent over the
whole range of frequencies (Fig. 2), but due to interindividual
variability, the group difference in frequency-specific analyses
reached formal statistical significance only at 5.7 Hz (0.17, SD
0.06 vs. 0.19, SD 0.06, P = 0.034), which is within the dominant fre-
quency band of bursting network activity in the term neonatal
EEG [for more details, see Tokariev et al. (2012)].
Global Brain Function
The measure of interhemispheric connectivity (ASI) showed
lower levels of global integration in the newborns exposed to
SRI. A comparable difference in ASI levels was found both during
the first (4.26, SD 2.27 vs. 6.42, SD 1.80, P = 0.006) and the second
EEG recording (3.91, SD 1.71 vs. 6.01, SD 1.24, P < 0.001, Fig. 3). Not-
ably, the ASI levels remained relatively constant within the
groups from the first to the second EEG recording, suggesting a
developmental persistence of interhemispheric synchrony. The
global average of spectral amplitudes showed significant differ-
ences between the control and SRI group at all lower frequencies
(0.7–2.0 Hz; Fig. 4A). A further spatial analysis using electrode-
level group comparisons showed that the significant difference
is concentrated to frontal brain regions. The global intermittency
of activity measured with median occipital IBIs was shorter in the
SRI group during the second recording (4.71 s, SD 0.61 vs. 5.07 s,
SD 0.57, P = 0.037).
Comparison of hemispheric asymmetries at specific fre-
quency bands showed no global-level group difference between
SRI and control newborns at any frequency. An electrode-level

marked with a red background) is a common neonatal EEG feature, recognized as a
visually prominent, sub-second long epoch of alpha-frequency activity in the
frontal EEG signals. (B) NC measures the phase–amplitude coupling. It refers to
a cross-frequency interaction where transiently increased amplitudes of high-
frequency activity (a smoothed amplitude envelope is shown in red on the top
of the band-pass filtered oscillations) are nested into a specific phase of low-
frequency activity, here the troughs of the slow waves. These frequency
components are shown to arise from different cortical (cx) and subcortical
(subplate, sp) layers, but they superimpose in the epicortical (scalp) EEG
recording. This makes nestedness a unique measure with ability to probe local
cortical wiring. (C) ASI measures interhemispheric synchrony that is seen as a
co-occurrence of bursts in both hemispheres. The example above shows high
interhemispheric synchrony (high ASI), typical of a normally developing term
infant. The example below shows low interhemispheric synchrony (low ASI),
typical of abnormal EEG function in at term age.

 comparison, however, disclosed a group difference between SRI
and control newborns at the alpha and beta frequencies of both
frontal and temporal brain regions (Fig. 4B).
Newborn Brain Function Versus Maternal Psychiatric Assessments
Maternal mood is known to affect different aspects of early neu-
robehavioral development (Gentile 2015). Hence, in a post hoc
analysis, we wished to assess 2 alternative explanations for the
found differences in the EEG measures between SRI and control
infants. First, could the newborn EEG findings be explained by
an unknown, inherited “endophenotype” (Goldstein and Klein
2014) seen as an EEG difference according to mothers’ lifetime
history of depression or anxiety? Second, could the newborn
EEG findings be related to mood- or anxiety-related factors like
hormones during pregnancy, reflected as a correlation with
mother’s BAI or BDI scores?

 In the analysis with cases and controls pooled together, our
EEG parameters suggested very few and seemingly erratic albeit
formally statistically significant relations to maternal mood or
anxiety. To provide a comprehensive overview, Supplementary
Material shows comparisons of maternal psychiatric measures
to all EEG features that we found to have statistically significant
SRI effects (see above). Overall, based on the analysis of statistical
significance, as well as the effect direction and size in the total
sample, we conclude that the main findings are more likely ex-
plained by medication exposure or an interaction with medica-
tion and mood/anxiety rather than by lifetime or current
depression or anxiety. Furthermore, neither the EEG parameters
nor the clinical findings differed significantly in respect of mater-
nal educational level (see Supplementary Table 1).
Discussion
This is the first study to show that prenatal SRI exposure in hu-
mans can affect the newborn cortical function beyond the acute
withdrawal period. Our detailed quantitative, computational EEG
analyses indicated SRI-related effects in both focal and global
brain activity. Some effects were only seen during the first post-
natal week, and they might be reflections of the acute adaptation
after postnatal SRI abstinence. However, lower interhemispheric
connectivity (ASI), lower local cross-frequency integration (NC),
and changes in the QS (IBI) outlasted the acute withdrawal time
period, suggesting more long-lasting developmental effects by
prenatal SRI exposure. Moreover, comparison of EEG with mater-
nal symptoms suggested that these changes are likely due to
medication or an interaction with medication and mood/anxiety
rather than maternal depression or anxiety per se. While com-
parable, advanced EEG analyses have not been performed in
prior human studies, our findings are fully compatible with re-
cent experimental work that has suggested a range of neurodeve-
lopmental effects by early SRI exposure.
Translational Comparisons
Previous preclinical studies have suggested multiple mechan-
isms through which a prenatal SRI exposure may affect brain de-
velopment of the offspring. The early developmental changes in
the expression of serotonin transporter (5-HTT) gene are known
to be region-specific, with particular differences between frontal
versus deeper brain expressions, and they converge toward more
mature patterns soon after birth (Homberg et al. 2010; Kiryanova
et al. 2013). These 5-HTT expressions are genetically scheduled;
however, they are also affected by various hormonal factors
that may be involved in the epigenetic effects, such as maternal
psychiatric status or fetal drug exposure (Oberlander et al. 2009;
Homberg et al. 2010; Kiryanova et al. 2013).
Our computational EEG measures were designed to target me-
chanisms that allow bridging from the human scalp EEG to ex-
perimental animal studies. Prior preclinical work in rodent
models showed that early SRI exposure exerts widespread histo-
logical changes in the brain networks (Xu et al. 2004; Simpson
et al. 2011). Most importantly in the present context, the work
by Simpson et al. (2011) reported significant reduction in the cal-
losal nerve fibers, as well as a reduction in cortico-cortical syn-
chronization of neuronal activity. These are fully compatible
with our present finding that interhemispheric, that is, presum-
ably callosally mediated, synchrony is reduced in human infants
after in utero SRI exposure. The other histological and electro-
physiological abnormalities in the cortical networks of SRI-ex-
posed experimental models (Xu et al. 2004; Homberg et al. 2010;
Liao and Lee 2011) may readily offer a cellular-level basis for
our other observations. For instance, we found reduction in
cross-frequency integration that relies on an effective interplay
in the local cortical–subcortical (including subplate) networks
(Hyafil et al. 2015). We also found a significant reduction of low-
frequency EEG activity in the frontal areas, which is the last of
cortical regions to mature (Andre et al. 2010). Prior rodent work
has reported a transient frontal expression of serotonin transpor-
ters and a reduced arborization of prefrontal dendritic branching
after SRI exposure during the first postnatal week (Homberg et al.
2010), which roughly equals to the last trimester of human gesta-
tion (Clancy et al. 2007). These findings from rodent models sup-
port the idea that the observed frontal EEG effects may be
particularly due to last trimester SRI exposure.
Withdrawal Versus Sustained
A clinically well-known consequence of fetal SRI exposure is the
acute perinatal abstinence syndrome including neurological
symptoms such as jitteriness, irritability, and lower habituation
(Oberlander et al. 2009; Forsberg et al. 2014; Ray and Stowe
2014). The peak incidence of the abstinence symptoms occurs

Amplitude spectrum comparison between SRI (red) and control (blue) groups
(results shown from QS Rec 1 EEG epochs; mean ± SEM) shows that frequencies
below 4 Hz are significantly higher in the control infants (**P < 0.01, *P < 0.05,
oP < 0.1; Wilcoxon rank-sum test). The amplitude distribution over the scalp is
shown on topoplots for one of the significantly differing frequencies (0.7 Hz),
and the orange circles in the topoplot depict individual electrodes with
significant group differences (P < 0.05). Note that the group difference is
frontally dominant. (B) Hemispheric amplitude asymmetry computed at the
electrode level (here, from QS Rec 1 epochs) is significantly different between
the infant groups in the most frontal (Fp) and temporal (T) electrodes. The
graphs depict mean ± SEM amplitude values over the given frequency range,
and the significant differences are depicted (*P < 0.05, oP < 0.1; Wilcoxon rank-
sum test). To aid comparison of different frequencies, the Y-scale for the values
on the light blue background is multiplied by a factor of 10−1.

 2–90 h postnatally (Ter Horst et al. 2008; Warburton et al. 2010;
Salisbury et al. 2011; Forsberg et al. 2014; Ray and Stowe 2014).
Our results are in line with the recent study of Salisbury et al.
(2016) that shows neurological effects of SRI exposure can sub-
stantially outlast the immediate withdrawal syndrome. Here we
observed that many EEG effects are clearly visible at the second
recording, on average over 2 weeks after birth, which suggests
that the SRI effects on EEG would more likely reflect effects on
brain development rather than direct drug effects on brain activ-
ity. This interpretation is compatible with the now clinically well-
established idea that early developmental compromises, such as
prematurity-related respiratory distress, circulatory comprom-
ise, or fetal drug exposures, would manifest themselves at term
age as long-lasting effects in EEG maturation (Hahn and Tharp
1990; Nunes et al. 2014; Videman et al. 2016).
Pharmacological Versus Maternal Effects
The few prior clinical studies have suggested that maternal de-
pression and/or anxiety may not only affect the later neurobeha-
vioral development of the offspring (Thibodeau et al. 2006; Field
and Diego 2008), but there may even be an association to the new-
born EEG activity (Biagioni et al. 2007; Thibodeau et al. 2008).
When examining relationships and frequencies between new-
born EEG and maternal psychiatric symptoms in our study co-
hort, the findings were not consistent with a presence of a
neonatal EEG “endophenotype” of maternal depression (Gold-
stein and Klein 2014). A closer comparison of our methods with
those used in earlier studies suggests that an obvious analytical
confounder cannot be excluded as the source of reported neo-
natal EEG “endophenotypes”: First, the prior studies have not dis-
tinguished between vigilance states (44,45), which we showed
recently to have major effects on all EEG metrics (Tokariev et al.
2015). Pooling EEG epochs from different sleep states will strongly
bias the EEG measures, so that they reflect the infant’s sleep stage
rather than a genuine brain phenotype. Notably, our extensive
practical experience shows that sleeping behavior per se is af-
fected by maternal symptoms. Second, prior studies have used
generally less EEG data, and they included more variable amount
of EEG into the analysis, which are practically reasoned by a lack of
good quality data. However, such compromises will necessarily af-
fect group-level findings, especially because the availability of EEG
data is inherently biased by covariance with the infant’s restless-
ness (see also above).
In partial accordance with the earlier studies, our more strin-
gent recording and signal analysis did result in observing an EEG
asymmetry with greater left-side amplitudes. This asymmetry,
however, was related to maternal drug treatment rather than ma-
ternal psychiatric status. We also extend prior reports by showing
this EEG effect at a wider frequency range as well as in wider brain
areas, which were not examined in the earlier works due to their
recording constraints (44,45).
Methodological Considerations
There were some methodological details that should be considered
when comparing our work with the previous literature. Our study
was prospective, and the status of mothers was evaluated using
stringent psychiatric evaluation including current and lifetime
mood and anxiety, while newborns underwent a blinded EEG ana-
lysis and structured neurological examinations. This made our
study considerably labor-intensive when compared with many
previous studies using retrospective or registry-based data collec-
tion (Forsberg et al. 2014; Malm et al. 2015; Wemakor et al. 2015).
Our patient recruitment was based on SRI use instead of the
need for psychiatric intervention for MDD, hence our sample in-
cludes individuals with no or mild symptoms of depression. In-
deed, practically none of our mothers were currently having
any other psychiatric treatment, and the most common indica-
tion of chronic SRI treatment in our cohort was prevention of pre-
vious severe anxiety disorder (Table 2). Such a population with
mixed SRI indications and a more variable psychiatric status is
unlike in most previous studies; however, it allowed us to distin-
guish analytically the effects of maternal drug treatment and
psychiatric symptoms. Another key advantage in our study de-
sign was the early examination of SRI effects, which is the only
way to limit, if not fully eliminate, the impact of a significant con-
founder, the postnatal environment, including mother–child in-
teractions. It is neurobiologically plausible to conclude that the
reported EEG effects are more likely due to in utero effects than
the postnatal environment. Future studies should aim at sam-
pling cohorts that enable analysis of specific drug molecules
and timing of exposure.
Though the basic mechanisms of action are analogous be-
tween various SRIs, the effects and placental transfer rates of
SRIs may vary as shown in earlier studies (Noorlander et al.
2008; Amodeo et al. 2015). The fact that we had 7 different SRIs
in our study could be one possible confounding factor. Though
the metabolism of SRIs in the neonatal period is not fully under-
stood (Gentile 2005; Ter Horst et al. 2008), the elimination half-
times below 40 h (the only exception being sertraline up to 4
days) suggest that the blood levels of SRIs of placental origin
were minimal if any by the time of our second EEG recording
(mean age 17 days), as well as the neurological examination
(mean age 10 days). However, since plasma levels of SRI medica-
tions at the time of EEG recordings were not available, we cannot
fully exclude the possibility of babies receiving SRIs via breast-
feeding. We also could not statistically exclude the effect of ma-
ternal smoking because of the small number of smokers among
mothers (Table 2). These factors are very unlikely to explain our
present findings; however, more studies with larger sample
sizes and different populations will be needed to define the po-
tential of these maternal factors to affect the observed EEG
metrics.
We report statistical correlations and group differences;
hence, this work does not provide direct evidence needed for a
genuine causal reasoning. The main output of our present work
is the identification of human EEG correlates of SRI exposure,
which opens 2 directions of future research: First, larger-scale fol-
low-up studies in humans will be able to search for the clinical
significance of the observed EEG changes with respect to later
neurodevelopment (Hermansen and Melinder 2015; Man et al.
2015). Second, the observed EEG changes allow benchmarking
with future preclinical studies where animal models are used
to learn about the cellular- and molecular-level mechanisms,
as well as to test the already promising intervention strategies
(Zhou et al. 2015). Finally, our present findings may provide fur-
ther evidence for a critical attitude toward the use of SRIs during
pregnancy (Hanley et al. 2015) and stress the importance of find-
ing non-medical treatments for depressive and anxiety symp-
toms. An ultimate implication of this is recognition of the need
to re-evaluate treatment guidelines for depression and anxiety
in nonsymptomatic mothers.
