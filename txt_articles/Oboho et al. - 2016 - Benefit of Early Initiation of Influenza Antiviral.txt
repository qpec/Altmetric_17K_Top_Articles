Background.
We describe the impact of early initiation of influenza antiviral treatment among pregnant women hospitalized
with laboratory-confirmed influenza during the 2010–2014 influenza seasons.
Methods.
Severe influenza was defined as illness with ≥1 of the following: intensive care unit admission, need for mechanical ven-
tilation, respiratory failure, pulmonary embolism, sepsis, or death. Within severity stratum, we used parametric survival analysis to com-
pare length of stay by timing of antiviral treatment, adjusting for underlying conditions, influenza vaccination, and pregnancy trimester.
Results.
Among 865 pregnant women, the median agewas 27 years (interquartile range [IQR], 23–31 years). Most (68%) were healthy,
and85%receivedantiviraltreatment.Sixty-threewomen(7%)hadsevereinfluenza,and4died.Severitywasassociatedwithpretermdelivery

fluenza vaccination is warranted.

Pregnant women are at increased risk for seasonal and pandem-
ic influenza-related complications [1–6]. During the 2009 influ-
enza A(H1N1) pandemic, pregnant women represented 1% of
the US population and yet accounted for 6% of hospitalizations
and 5% of deaths associated with infection due to the pandemic
strain (influenza A[H1N1]pdm09) [2].Complications described
during this period included intensive care unit (ICU) admis-
sion, respiratory failure, and preterm delivery [2–4, 7]. Since
then, limited data have been published describing pregnant
women with influenza [8–10].
To reduce influenza-associated morbidity and mortality, the
American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology and the Advi-
sory Committee on Immunization Practices recommend annual
influenza vaccination for pregnant women at any time during
pregnancy [11–13]. However, current estimates of vaccination
coverage among pregnant women are around 50% [14].Consid-
ering the suboptimal influenza vaccine uptake in this group, an-
tiviral medications are an important adjunct to managing
treatment in pregnant women with suspected influenza [12].
The objectives of this study were to describe the epidemiology
and clinical outcomes associated with hospitalizations for labo-
ratory-confirmed influenza among pregnant women during re-
cent influenza seasons in the United States and to assess the
impact of early initiation of influenza antiviral treatment in
this population.

 surveillance in selected counties in California, Colorado, Con-
necticut, Georgia, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, New Mexico,
New York, Ohio, Oregon, Rhode Island, Tennessee, and Utah.
The network includes >240 hospitals covering approximately
27 million people (about 9% of the US population). Data col-
lection was determined by the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention to be for routine public health surveillance purpos-
es and thus was not subject to institutional review board (IRB)
approval for human research protections. Participating sites
submitted the study to their state and local IRBs for review
as required.
Data Collection and Definitions
In this analysis, we included pregnant women aged 15–44 years
residing in the surveillance area who were hospitalized within 2
days of an influenza virus–positive test result. All were enrolled
during 4 consecutive influenza seasons, beginning in 2010–
2011, with a season defined as the interval from 1 October
through 30 April. Hospitalization was defined as an admission
to an inpatient ward of the hospital; an overnight stay was not
required. Laboratory testing for influenza virus was performed
at the discretion of the clinicians providing medical care, and
confirmation included a positive result of reverse transcription
polymerase chain reaction analysis, rapid antigen testing, direct
or indirect fluorescent antibody staining, or viral culture.
Patients were identified through hospital laboratory and ad-
mission databases, infection control logs, and hospital discharge
data. For patients with a positive result of an influenza virus test,
medical records were reviewed using a standardized case report
form to collect information on demographic characteristics,
pregnancy status, medical history, and clinical course of illness
during hospital stay, including certain complications (eg, en-
cephalitis and pneumonia), admission to the intensive care
unit (ICU), need for mechanical ventilation, and mortality.
Data abstraction also captured the first 9 hospital discharge
codes, using the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth
Revision (ICD-9).
We used data abstracted from medical records and ICD-9
codes to categorize complications as follows: pneumonia
(ICD-9 codes 089, 480–487, and 488.11), respiratory failure
(ICD-9 codes 799.1, 518.81, 518.84, and V46.1), acute respirato-
ry distress syndrome (ARDS; ICD-9 codes 518.5 and 518.82),
pulmonary embolism (ICD-9 codes 415.1 and 673), asthma ex-
acerbation (ICD-9 codes 493.01–02, 493.11–12, 493.21–22, and
493.91–92), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) ex-
acerbation (ICD-9 codes 491.21–22), sepsis (ICD-9 codes 286.6,
036.3, 040.82, 785.5, and 995.91–92), diabetic ketoacidosis
(ICD-9 codes 249.1 and 250.1), acute renal failure (ICD-9
codes 584, 572.4, and 404.02–03), and dehydration (ICD-9
codes 276.50–276.52). Fetal loss was identified based on ICD-
9 codes for missed abortion and spontaneous abortion (ICD-9
codes 632 and 634).
Underlying medical conditions were classified into the fol-
lowing categories: asthma, chronic pulmonary disease (apart
from asthma), metabolic disease, cardiovascular disease (ex-
cluding hypertension), blood disorders/hemoglobinopathy,
neurologic/neuromuscular disease, renal disease, and liver dis-
ease. Pregnant women were stratified into the first (≤13 weeks
gestation), second (14–28 weeks gestation), and third (≥29
weeks gestation) trimesters of pregnancy. Delivery at <37
weeks gestation was considered before term. A patient was con-
sidered vaccinated if receipt of influenza vaccine occurred at
least 14 days prior to hospitalization, considering the relevant
influenza season. When the date of a patient′s influenza vacci-
nation was not available in the medical record, a vaccination
registry or the patient′s primary care provider was consulted
or the patient was interviewed to obtain vaccination history
[15]. Severe influenza was defined by ICU admission, need
for mechanical ventilation, respiratory failure (including
ARDS), pulmonary embolism, sepsis, or death. Hospital length
of stay (LOS) was calculated as the discharge date minus the ad-
mission date. Treatment was considered as receipt of influenza
antiviral medication at any time during the course of illness (in-
cluding receipt up to 2 days before hospitalization, if treatment
was continued after admission). The time from illness onset to
antiviral treatment initiation was stratified into early treatment
(if antiviral medication was initiated ≤2 days from illness onset)
and late treatment (if antiviral medication was initiated >2 days
from illness onset).
Statistical Analysis
We used χ2 or Fisher exact tests to compare clinical character-
istics among pregnant women and frequencies of outcomes
and complications, by severity, for categorical variables.
Kruskal–Wallis test was performed to assess differences in the
distribution of nonnormally distributed continuous variables.
When examining the impact of early initiation of antiviral treat-
ment, we only included treated patients in our models, to avoid
any potential treatment bias introduced by physicians’ inclina-
tion to treat more severe cases [16]. Assuming that treatment
would need to be initiated for a full day before it could be ben-
eficial, we excluded patients hospitalized for ≤1 day from our
models. Among patients hospitalized for >1 day, within each se-
verity stratum we used parametric survival analysis to compare
hospital LOS by the timing of antiviral treatment, adjusting for
the presence of underlying medical conditions, influenza vacci-
nation status, and pregnancy trimester. We limited the model to
pregnant women who did not deliver during hospitalization, to
remove the potential confounding effect of delivery on LOS. We
chose a parametric survival analysis because of the approxi-
mately normal distribution of our data, and we wanted to esti-
mate the adjusted median hospital LOS and difference by the
timing of antiviral treatment [17]. Women with unknown
dates of illness onset and antiviral initiation and women who

 died during hospitalization were excluded from the parametric
analysis. We characterized the distribution of LOS, using expo-
nential, Weibull, log-logistic and log-normal models. For each
severity stratum, we chose the model with the best fit, based
on plots of transformed survival probabilities against log-days,
which produce straight lines and tight data scatter when used
for the appropriate survival model [17]. For all predictors and
associations between variables, differences were considered sig-
nificant at a P value of < .05. All analyses were performed using
SAS software, version 9.3 (Cary, North Carolina).

 RESULTS
General Characteristics and Influenza-Associated Complications
During the influenza seasons from 2010–2011 through 2013–
2014, 865 of 3169 women (27%) aged 15–44 years hospitalized
with laboratory-confirmed influenza were pregnant. Over half
(52%) were aged 25–34 years, and 57% were in the third trimes-
ter of pregnancy (Table 1). The most commonly reported racial/
ethnic groups in our study were non-Hispanic white (42%), fol-
lowed by non-Hispanic black (32%) and Hispanic (25%). The
majority (68%) had no underlying medical conditions other
than pregnancy, but among those who did, the most common
condition was asthma (21%). Most women (85%) were treated
with antivirals, and all treated women received oseltamivir
(Tamiflu). Only 26% of hospitalized pregnant women had re-
ceived influenza vaccine for the season. The median time from
illness onset to hospitalization was 1 day (interquartile range
[IQR], 0–2 days). The median time from hospitalization to an-
tiviral treatment was 0 days (IQR, 0–1 days), with the majority
of women (71%) treated ≤2 days from illness onset (Table 1).
The median LOS was 2 days (IQR, 1–3 days) for all pregnant
women. The most common complications were pneumonia
(13%), dehydration (9%), asthma exacerbation (6%), respiratory
failure (3%), and sepsis (3%; Table 2).
Characteristics, by Severity
Sixty-three women (7%) met criteria for severe influenza, of
whom 4 (6%) died. Women with severe influenza were more
likely to be in an earlier stage of pregnancy and to have under-
lying medical conditions, compared with pregnant women with
nonsevere influenza (44% vs 31%; P = .03; Table 1). Women
with severe influenza were less likely to have received influenza
vaccination than women with nonsevere influenza (14% vs 26%;
P = .03; Table 1). The presence of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09
was more likely among women with severe influenza (42% vs
21%; P = .01). Of the 4 women who died, all were treated with
antivirals; 3 were treated >2 days after illness onset, including
one who was admitted within 2 days of illness onset (the date
of illness onset was unknown for 1 patient); and only 1 had re-
ceived influenza vaccine for the season. Three of the deaths in-
volved women <35 years of age with no underlying medical
conditions. The frequency of influenza antiviral treatment did
not differ by disease severity. The median times from illness
onset to hospitalization and from illness onset to antiviral treat-
ment also did not differ by severity (Table 1).
Pregnancy-Related Complications and Outcomes
One hundred eighty-eight women (22%) had a live birth
while hospitalized with influenza, of whom 41 (22%) delivered
before term (Table 3). Among women with live births, preterm
delivery was more common among those with severe influenza,
compared with those with nonsevere influenza (5 of 7 [71%] vs
36 of 181 [20%]; P < .01). A total of 4 of 865 women (0.4%) ex-
perienced a fetal loss during hospitalization; 3 (5%) were among
the 63 with severe influenza, compared with 1 (0.1%) among the
802 with nonsevere influenza (P < .01). Women with severe in-
fluenza had a longer median hospital LOS than women with
nonsevere influenza (5 days [IQR, 2–7 days] vs 2 days [IQR,
1–3 days]; P < .01; Table 3).
Parametric Survival Analysis
There were 15 of 63 women (23.8%) with severe influenza and
215 of 802 (26.8%) with nonsevere influenza who were included
in the model. They all had available information on timing of

their hospitalization (Figure 1). We examined 4 models to deter-
mine the best fit for the data. The best fit was the exponential
model for women with severe influenza (Figure 2) and the log-
logistic model for those with nonsevere influenza (Figure 3).
Using these best-fit models, we found that, after adjustment for
the presence of any underlying medical condition, influenza vac-
cination status, and pregnancy trimester, early initiation of anti-
viral treatment (ie, ≤2 days from illness onset) was associated
with a shorter LOS. Among women with severe influenza who
were treated early, the median LOS was 2.2 days (IQR, 0.9–5.8

an LOS (2.4 days [IQR, 2.3–2.5 days]) than those treated later (3.1
days [IQR, 2.8–3.5 days]; P < .01; Figure 1B).
DISCUSSION
This is the first and largest study to report on the clinical charac-
teristics and outcomes of pregnant women hospitalized with lab-
oratory-confirmed influenza since the 2009 influenza pandemic.
In this study, most hospitalized pregnant women had no under-
lying medical conditions and were admitted to the hospital for a
median of 2 days; approximately 60% were in their third trimes-
ter of pregnancy at time of hospitalization. Although influenza in
most women was relatively uncomplicated medically, 7% had se-
vere influenza, 4 died, and 4 experienced fetal loss. Women with
severe influenza were more likely to be earlier in gestation, to have
underlying medical conditions, and to experience preterm deliv-
ery and fetal loss than women with nonsevere influenza. After ad-
justment for any medical condition, vaccination status, and
pregnancy trimester, antiviral treatment given ≤2 days from
illness onset reduced hospital LOS among women who neither
delivered nor died during hospitalization. This was more pro-
nounced among women with severe influenza, who had a reduc-
tion in median LOS of approximately 5 days.
The high antiviral coverage (85%) in our study population,
suggests that providers have continued to use influenza antiviral
agents to treat hospitalized pregnant women with laboratory-
confirmed influenza since the 2009 pandemic [2, 3, 16, 18]. Fur-
thermore, during the 2009 pandemic, 24%–50% of pregnant
women were treated early (ie, ≤2 days from illness onset) [2,
3, 7]. In contrast, we found that, among pregnant women who
received antivirals in our study, 71% were treated early, perhaps
demonstrating patients’ awareness of the importance of seeking
care early and physicians′ adherence to influenza antiviral treat-
ment recommendations [12].
Previous studies have shown that early initiation influenza-
associated antiviral treatment reduces the duration and severity
of influenza and decreases the frequency of associated compli-

 impact of early versus late initiation of antiviral treatment on
LOS among pregnant women hospitalized with severe and non-
severe influenza. We found that influenza antiviral treatment
initiated ≤2 days from illness onset was associated with a reduc-
tion in LOS of approximately 5 days among women with severe
influenza. The magnitude of the effect of antiviral treatment was
less pronounced among women with nonsevere influenza, with
a significant reduction in LOS of <1 day. The impact of early
initiation of influenza antiviral treatment on LOS may reflect
the effect of antiviral medications on attenuating other out-
comes that influence LOS. The timing of antiviral initiation
has been shown to have an important effect on clinical
outcomes among critically ill patients with influenza [23, 24].
Antiviral therapy may have a more substantial impact on severe
influenza, owing to more active and prolonged viral replication
[25–27]. Our data demonstrate findings similar to those of
Louie et al, who noted that the relative risk of ICU admission
among pregnant women treated >2 days after symptom onset
was 4 times that among women treated earlier during the 2009
pandemic [7].
The most common complications associated with hospitali-
zation in our patient-population were pneumonia, asthma exac-
erbation, dehydration, and sepsis. These complications were less
common among pregnant women, compared to nonpregnant
women, aged 15–44 years in FluSurv-NET (Table 4). In addi-
tion, ICU admission, need for mechanical ventilation, and
death accounted for a smaller proportion of hospitalizations
in this study, compared with reports from the 2009 pandemic.
During the 2009 pandemic, the percentages of hospitalized
pregnant women who required ICU admission (12%–19%),
needed mechanical ventilation (6%–14%), and died (1%–6%)
[2, 7, 18] were almost 2-fold higher than those seen in our

 study population. Our findings may reflect a lower threshold for
pregnant women to be hospitalized, owing to increased
physician awareness of influenza-associated complications in
pregnant women, as well as the impact of early initiation of an-
tiviral treatment.
Few women (26%) in our study had received influenza vacci-
nation. Studies have reported low vaccination coverage (15%)
among pregnant women prior to the 2009 pandemic [28]. Vac-
cination coverage has increased since, but it is still suboptimal
(50%) [14]. It should be noted that in our study, pregnant
women with severe influenza were almost half as likely to be vac-
cinated as pregnant women with nonsevere influenza, which
could suggest that unvaccinated pregnant women may have an
increased risk for severe outcomes. Although we did not explore
this association in our analysis, influenza vaccination has been
shown to be effective among pregnant women, reducing the
risk of laboratory-confirmed influenza by approximately 50%
[29]. The protection afforded by vaccination may also extend to
infants, principally in their first 6 months of life, when they are
not eligible for vaccination [30–33].Annual influenza vaccination
should be offered to pregnant women at any gestational age, to
prevent complications in mother and infant [13, 34].
Influenza virus infection of pregnant women influenced infant
morbidity during the 2009 pandemic [2, 7, 18]. Similarly during
the subsequent nonpandemic period, we found that 22% of de-
liveries among women who gave birth during their influenza-
associated hospitalization were before term, which is higher than
the percentage of preterm births (11%–12%) reported nationally
in the United States for all births during 2011–2013 [35]. During
influenza pandemics, studies have reported preterm birth fre-
quencies of 8%–30% among women who delivered during
their influenza-associated hospitalization [2, 18, 36]. The propor-
tion of births occurring before term and the proportion of preg-
nancies resulting in fetal loss noted in our study were even higher
among those with severe influenza, consistent with another study
from the 2009 pandemic, which described higher frequencies of
pregnancies resulting in preterm delivery and fetal death among
women admitted to the ICU [18]. The frequency of pregnancies
resulting in preterm births and fetal loss seen in pregnant women
underscores the adverse consequences of influenza among preg-
nant women even during nonpandemic periods.
Our study is subject to several limitations. First, the decision
to hospitalize pregnant women is complex, and there may be
unaccounted factors that influenced this decision, since sub-
stantial differences existed between pregnant and nonpregnant
women aged 15–44 years with influenza (Table 4). Hospitalized
pregnant women in FluSurv-NET were tested at the discretion
of treating clinicians. Thus, those with milder or atypical influ-
enza symptoms could have been missed. Alternatively, physi-
cians may be more inclined to test pregnant women than
nonpregnant women for influenza and to hospitalize pregnant
women with mild influenza. Therefore, we likely captured a
broad spectrum of influenza presentations in this population.
Second, we did not collect information on type of delivery;
thus, we were unable to adjust for it. Because cesarean delivery

 could be associated with a prolonged hospital stay, we avoided
this potential bias by restricting our analysis to women who did
not deliver during hospitalization. Finally, pneumonia diagno-
sis at the time of admission could confound the association be-
tween the timing of treatment and LOS, because those with
pneumonia could require lengthy hospitalization. However,
we believe that any potential confounding effect was mitigated
by building separate models for women with severe and those
with nonsevere influenza and by the fact that only a small per-
centage (13%) of women with radiographic information at ad-
mission had a diagnosis of pneumonia (Table 2).
In conclusion, pregnant women are at risk of influenza com-
plications during seasonal influenza. Influenza virus infection
during pregnancy continues to be associated with maternal
and infant morbidity, including ICU admission, preterm birth,
fetal loss, and maternal death. All pregnant women should re-
ceive annual influenza vaccination to prevent influenza and as-
sociated complications for themselves and their infants. Early
initiation of antiviral treatment may reduce hospital LOS,
particularly among women who have a more severe influenza
presentation. When influenza is suspected among pregnant
women, physicians should initiate antiviral treatment early,
without waiting for laboratory test results.
