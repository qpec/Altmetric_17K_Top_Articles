Abstract
Background: Cell phone use during pregnancy is a public health concern. We investigated the association between
maternal cell phone use in pregnancy and child’s language, communication and motor skills at 3 and 5 years.
Methods: This prospective study includes 45,389 mother-child pairs, participants of the MoBa, recruited at mid-
pregnancy from 1999 to 2008. Maternal frequency of cell phone use in early pregnancy and child language,
communication and motor skills at 3 and 5 years, were assessed by questionnaires. Logistic regression was used to
estimate the associations.
Results: No cell phone use in early pregnancy was reported by 9.8% of women, while 39%, 46.9% and 4.3% of the
women were categorized as low, medium and high cell phone users. Children of cell phone user mothers had 17%
(OR = 0.83, 95% CI: 0.77, 0.89) lower adjusted risk of having low sentence complexity at 3 years, compared to children
of non-users. The risk was 13%, 22% and 29% lower by low, medium and high maternal cell phone use. Additionally,
children of cell phone users had lower risk of low motor skills score at 3 years, compared to children of non-users, but
this association was not found at 5 years. We found no association between maternal cell phone use and low
communication skills.
Conclusions: We reported a decreased risk of low language and motor skills at three years in relation to prenatal cell
phone use, which might be explained by enhanced maternal-child interaction among cell phone users. No evidence of
adverse neurodevelopmental effects of prenatal cell phone use was reported.
Background
The use of equipment that emits radio frequency elec-
tromagnetic field (RF-EMF) has increased tremendously
during the last 30 years and human exposure is wide-
spread. The most frequently used technology relates to
cell phones. In 2012, a Norwegian Experts Committee,
established by the Norwegian Ministry of Health and
Care
Services,
reviewed
the
evidence
on
possible
negative health effects from weak RF fields [1]. After
assesing a large number of studies, they concluded that
no evidence of adverse health effects from exposure to
weak RF fields was found. Other expert reviews, intitated
also by the increasing public concern, have reported
similar conclusions [2–4]. However there were few stud-
ies on reproductive and offspring’s developmental health,
including neurodevelopment.
In a series of studies within the Danish National Birth
Cohort, associations between maternal and child cell
phone use and developmental milestones and behaviour
of children were investigated [5–7]. Information on

 maternal cell phone use was collected retrospectively
when the child was 7 years old. These studies reported
an increased odds ratio for problematic behaviour at
7 years of age related to cell phone use during pregnancy
[5, 6]. However, no association was found between cell
phone use during pregnancy and offspring’s develop-
mental milestones at 6 and 18 months of age [7]. In a
Dutch birth cohort study, no association was found be-
tween prenatal exposure to cell phones or cordless
phones and behavioural problems at the age of 5 years
[8]. In a Spanish birth cohort study researchers found no
associattions between maternal cell phone use during
pregnacy and child’s early mental development [9]. How-
ever this is the only study in which child’s mental and
psychomotoric development was assesed by phycholo-
gists, while the number of partcipants was lower than
the Dutch and Danish studies.
As cell phone use has become abundant, cell phone
based interventions and monitoring are applied also in
the field of maternity and antenatal health care because
of it’s low-cost. It has been shown to be also a relatively
effective tool of public health promotion, especially in
developing countries [10, 11]. However, the other side of
the coin is that is important to investigate if there are
any health effects related to exposure to electromagnetic
fields during critical developmental periods, such as the
intrauterine life and early childhood.
The aim of this study was to investigate any associ-
ation between maternal phone use during first trimester
and a) language skills at 3 years, and b) communication,
gross and fine motor skills at 3 an 5 years of age, in a
large prospective birth cohort.
Methods
Study population
Our study is conducted within the MoBa, which is a
prospective population-based pregnancy cohort study
conducted by the Norwegian Institute of Public Health
[12]. Pregnant women from all over Norway were re-
cruited from 1999 to 2008 at 17–18 weeks of pregnancy
and 40.6% of invited women consented to participate.
There are 114,500 children, 95,200 mothers and 75,200
fathers recruited in the cohort. Data used in this study
are based on version 8 of the quality-assured data files,
released for research in February 2014. The establish-
ment and data collection in MoBa has obtained a licence
from the Norwegian Data Inspectorate and approval
from The Regional Committee for Medical Research
Ethics. This study was approved by the Regional Com-
mittee for Medical Research Ethics in South-Eastern
Norway
There were 96,875 singleton, live born pregnancies
with no malformations and chromosomal anomalies.
After excluding women with missing information in cell
phone use in the first trimester (n = 9843), as well as in
parity, maternal age, maternal education, year of delivery
and child gender (n = 1804) and child’s language,
communication, and motor skills at 3 years of age
(n = 39,839), the eligible study population was 45,389
mother-child pairs. For the neurodevelopmental out-
comes at 5 years our study population was 17,310
mother child pairs, with no additional missing informa-
tion on the communication and motor skills.
Maternal cell phone use during pregnancy
The use of cell phones during early pregnancy was
assessed by a questionnaire administered at 17th weeks
of gestation. Pregnant women were asked to report their
frequency of talking on the cell phone by choosing 1 of
the 4 fixed frequency answers: “seldom/never”, “few
times a week”, “daily” and “more than an hour daily”. In
our analysis, women were categorized into 4 groups of
cell phone use in early pregnancy according to their an-
swer in this question as: “no use”, “low use”, “medium
use”, and “high use”. Similar information on maternal
cell phone use was collected at 30th week of pregnancy
(n = 44,339).
Child language, communication and motor skills at 3
and 5 years
Early language development of the children at 3 years
was assessed by the Dale and Bishop Grammar rating, in
which the mother was asked to rate her child’s typical
sentence structure by choosing one of the six response
categories [13, 14]. The list of options is an ordinal
grammar rating with the highest rate indicating the most
complex use of language. We assessed the risk of having
lower sentence complexity, by grouping any ratings bel-
low six (≤5) and using the highest rating as the reference
group. We used this cut-off to capture potentially late
language development, basing the rationale on the publi-
cation by Dale P.S. et al., where 11% of the typical
children and 46% of the early language delay children
scored ≤5 [13]. As we do not expect children with severe
language delay in our study population, we used this
cut-off for capturing children with inflated language
scores, i.e. children who score lower than the typical
developing groups. Children categorized as “not yet
talking” (lowest rating) were excluded from our analysis
(n = 103).
Communication skills at 3 and 5 years, were assessed
by the “Ages and Stages” questionnaire (ASQ) [15]. We
defined children with low communication skills, as those
with score < 40 on the ASQ total score (0 to 60) at
3 years and those with score ≤ 30 on the ASQ total
score (0 to 60) at 5 years. At 3 years, 524 (1.2%) children,
and at 5 years, 95 (0.6%) children were ranked as having

 low communication skills, and 42 children were ranked
with low communication skills in both time points.
Motor skills at 3 years were also assessed by the “Ages
and Stages” questionnaire (ASQ) [15], and motor skills
at 5 years by the “Child Development Inventory” ques-
tionnaire (CDI) [16]. We defined low motor skills at 3
and 5 years as having a score in the lowest tertile calcu-
lated for the included study sample. Due to skewed
distributions of the scores the lowest tertile did not
include the exact 33% of the children, but 32% of the
3-year olds and 23% of the 5-year olds, which were
categorized as having low motor skills. The score cut-
off reflecting the lowest tertile was 30 (score range
0–40) for 3 year olds and 10 (score range 0–12) for
5 year old children. Approximately 2069 children
were ranked as having low motor skills in both time
points assessed. More detailed information on the
validity and scoring of the used instruments are pre-
sented in supplementary material (Additional file 1:
Tables S1, S2a, b, S3a, b).
Other characteristics
Several maternal socio-demographic, lifestyle and preg-
nancy related characteristics were examined as potential
confounders of the associations under study, including:
maternal age (years), maternal education (≤12 years/13–
16 years/≥17 years), parental income (both parents low
income/either parent high income/both parents high in-
come), parity (primiparous/multiparous), maternal occu-
pation (public sector or military/private sector or self-
employed/other), computer screen use during pregnancy
(yes/no),
marital
status
(living
with
partner/other),
smoking prior to and during pregnancy (no/occasion-
ally/daily), alcohol consumption prior to and during
pregnancy (never or <1 time per month/1–3 times per
month/≥1 time per week), use of folic acid supplements
during pregnancy (yes/no), pre-pregnancy body mass
index (BMI; <18.5, 18.5–24.9, 25–29.9, ≥30 kg/m2), type
of delivery (c-section/normal) and the length of gestation
(in weeks).
During the first years of life the interaction of the child
with the mother/caregiver can affect the child’s psycho-
social and cognitive development [17]. The amount of
talk in the
child’s environment, including talkative
mothers, can promote vocabulary output and syntactic
skills, trough high language input [18]. We hypothesized
that women with an extrovert personality would talk
more and report higher cell phone use than those with
lower score, which can promote child’s communication
skills. Maternal extrovert personality was assessed by the
International Personality Item Pool (IPIP) Big-Five factor
markers via a questionnaire administered at the 5 –years
follow-up [19]. The scoring of the included 10 items (5
positive and 5 negative) resulted to a continuous score
from 10 to 50, and women were categorized as “low”
(score < −1SD), “average” (−1SD < score < +1SD) and
“high” (score > +1SD) on extraversion, as suggested by
Goldberg et al. [19].
Additionally, we used the year of delivery to assess
time trends of cell phone use. Even though the recruit-
ment of MoBa was finished in 2008, meaning that the
cell phone questions were answered up to 2008, there
are women delivering at 2009. Paternal use of cell
phones for the 6 months before the pregnancy was
assessed
by
a
questionnaire
administered
around
15 weeks of pregnancy, but only 20,424 (45%) of the
fathers provided information on mobile phone use, due
to delayed administration of the fathers’ questionnaire.
In addition, two different questionnaire versions were
administered with different fixed answers of the ques-
tions assessing mobile phone use. We have included the
question with the answers similar to those the mothers
had to answer for comparability reasons, using the same
labeling of the categories as for the mothers.
Based on a-priori assumptions, breastfeeding duration
until
18
months
(no
breastfeeding/1–6
months/7–
13
months/>13
months),
child
gender
(boy/girl),
maternal depression and/or anxiety before and/or during
pregnancy (yes/no) were also assessed.
Characteristics that were univariately related with both
the exposure and the outcome at 3 years, were included
in our adjusted models as confounders.
Statistical analysis
We described the distribution and assessed the differences
of maternal socio-demographic, lifestyle and pregnancy
related characteristics by no use or any use of cell phone
in early pregnancy. Further, in a bar graph we described
the distribution of cell phone use in early pregnancy, by
year of delivery.
The crude and adjusted associations between maternal
cell phone use in early pregnancy and language, commu-
nication and motor skills of the children were assessed by
crude and multiple logistic regression models. Two differ-
ent classifications of the exposure variables were used: i) a
bivariate of no use vs. any use, and ii) a 4-level variable of
no use, low use, medium use and high use of cell phone in
early pregnancy. In addition, two adjusted models were
formed. First, one model with variables that were identi-
fied as confounders in univariate analyses and second, an-
other model with the maternal extrovert personality score
added. We performed complete case analysis of 45,389
mother-child pairs with the neurodevelopmental out-
comes at 3 years and of 17,310 mother-child pairs with
the neurodevelopmental outcomes at 5 years.
Further adjustment for maternal self-reported anxiety
and/or depression during pregnancy did not modified our
results, hence it was not included in the final models.

 Sensitivity analyses
The association with language skills at 3 years was ex-
amined as the risk of having lower sentence complexity
and, in sensitivity analysis, as the risk of having any of
the four specific categories of language skills. We con-
ducted all the analysis after excluding non-users, with
low cell phone users constituting the reference group. In
addition, we performed a stratified analysis by child’s
gender to examine any gender-specific susceptibility.
Several studies have shown an exponential increase of
mobile phone users from the mid to late 1990s’ in the
Nordic countries as well [20–22]. Around 2003, mobile
operators in Europe deployed Universal Mobile Tele-
communications System networks (3G), which were
upgraded in 2006, leading to a 4400 fold increase in data
transmission rates [23]. In addition, from the mid- to
late 2000s’ smartphones became more popular, including
the introduction of the iPhone. Hence, we have stratified
our analyses by these periods to investigate possible time
trends in cell phone use. In addition, this categorisation
provided groups with similar numbers of mother-child
pairs (37%, 32%, 31% of the study population in each
period group respectively). Further sensitivity analyses
included stratified analysis by year of birth (1999–2004,
2005–2006, 2007–2009) to study the potential effect of
changes in cell phone use. Since the number of non-
users decreased substantially during the period 2005–
2009, the exposure variable used was a 3-categories
variable with low cell phone users as the reference
group, after excluding non-users.
In addition, the association between paternal mobile
phone use during pregnancy and child neurodevelop-
ment was investigated as a sensitivity analysis. Approxi-
mately 16% of the women included in our study have
participated in the MoBa study with more than one
pregnancy. Hence, as a sensitivity analysis, we performed
logistic regression analyses by taking into account the
clusters of siblings within their mothers. Our study
population changed from the 3 year to the 5 year follow-
up due to loss of participants in addition to delayed ad-
ministration of the questionnaire (approximately 3 years
after the cohort had reached 5 years). We investigated
whether the exposure variable and the confounders
included in the models had a different distribution in each
sub-sample.
All analyses were performed using STATA 12.1 (Stata
Corporation, College Station, Texas).
Results
Ten percent (9.8%, n = 4428) of women reported no use
of cell phones in early pregnancy, 39% were categorized
as low phone users and 4.3% as high users. Cell phone
users were more likely to be younger, deliver after 2005,
primiparous, highly educated, with higher income, and
employed in the private sector or self-employed, com-
pared to non-users (Table 1). Prior to their pregnancy,
cell phone users were more likely to be occasional or
daily smokers and frequent alcohol consumers compared
with non-users. Maternal high extrovert personality
score was related to any cell phone use and high phone
use as well (7% of non-users, 9% of low users, 14% of
average users and 26% of high users had high extrovert
score). The same factors were related to high use of cell
phone compared with low use (data not shown). Cell
phone use was not substantially changed when re-
assessed later in pregnancy (week 30th), with 77%
remaining non-users and 46% remaining high users. The
agreement of cell phone use between the two time
points was 76% (Cohen’s kappa = 0.61). Paternal use of
cell phone during pregnancy tended to follow maternal
use (Cohen’s kappa = 0.17, agreement = 46%). Approxi-
mately, 23% of women non-users, 35% of women low
users, 68% of women medium users and 25% of women
high users were in the same cell phone use category as
their partner. We observed no difference by category of
maternal cell phone use related to marital status, pre-
pregnancy BMI, smoking, alcohol consumption and folic
acid supplements use during pregnancy, type of delivery,
preterm birth, child gender and breastfeeding duration
(data not shown).
The percentage of maternal high use of cell phone
early in pregnancy increased by year of delivery, from
0.6% in 2000–2001 to 9.1% in 2009 (Fig. 1). The percent-
age of mothers with any cell phone use increased from
67.7% in 2000–2001 to 98.8% in 2009.
Approximatelly, 23% of the children were categorized
as having lower sentence complexity at 3 years. Children
born to cell phones users had 27% lower risk of having
lower sentence complexity at 3 years of age, compared
to children of non-users (Table 2). When the same
association was assessed by none, low, medium and high
maternal cell phone use a dose response association was
found. After adjustement for confounders the observed
association persisted; the risk of a child having lower
sentence complexity at 3 years was 13%, 22% and 29%
lower for low, medium and high maternal cell phone
use, respectively, compared to children of non-users.
After adding maternal extroversion score in the regres-
sion model, similar results were obtained.
After excluding non-users we observed a similar dose-
response adjusted association for the risk of lower sentence
complexity (medium cell phone users: OR = 0.90, 95%
CI = 0.85, 0.95 and high cell phone users: OR = 0.82, 95%
CI = 0.77, 1.02) (Additional file 2: Figure S1). Stratified ana-
lysis by gender provided similar results (Additional file 2:
Figure S2A). Finally, when stratifying by year of delivery we
found similar results as in the overall analysis, while with
wider confidence intervals (Additional file 2: Figure S2B).

 By examining the specified language skills as outcomes,
we found a 14% (OR = 0.86, 95 CI% = 0.79,0.93) lower risk
of having incomplete grammar and 31% (OR = 0.69, 95%
CI = 0.59,0.81) lower risk of having moderate language
delay at 3 years when the mother was a cell phone user
compared to non-users (Additional file 1: Table S4). The
associattion between cell phone use and moderate lan-
guage delay was strengthen when adjusting for maternal
extrovert score (OR = 0.49, 95% CI = 0.30,0.80). No asso-
ciation was observed between maternal cell phone use
during pregnancy and the two most severe groups of

 language skills, severe language delay and speech prob-
lems (Additional file 1: Table S4).
Approximatelly, 1.2% of the 3 years-olds and 0.6% of
the 5 years-olds included in this study, were categorized
as having delayed communication skills. High maternal
cell phone use during pregnancy was associated with
56% lower risk of delayed communication skills in 3-
year old children, but adjustement for confounders
removed this association (Table 3). We observed no
association between maternal cell phone use during
pregnancy and the risk for delayed communication skills
in 5-year-old children. The null associations remained also
after excluding non-users (Additional file 2: Figure S1).
Regarding the associattions with motor skills, children
of cell phone users had 18% lower risk of low motor
skills (score in the lowest tertile). With regard to specific
frequency of use the respective risks were 12%, 26% and
36% lower for low, medium and high cell phone users
compared to non-users, in the adjusted model (Table 4).
Ajustement for maternal extroversion score attenuated
the estimates, while the dose-response trend persisted.
After excluding non-users leaving the low-use as refer-
ence, the negative dose-response associattion remained
(Additional file 2: Figure S1). Stratification by gender
provided similar results (Additional file 2: Figure S3A).
Similar results were obtained also after stratification by
year of delivery (Additional file 2: Figure S3B). We
observed no association between maternal cell phone
use during pregnancy and the risk for motor skills score
in the lowest tertile for 5-year-old children.
No substantial difference of the distribution of the
exposure variable and the confounders was found between
the study samples at the 3 and 5 years follow-up
(Additional file 1: Table S6). To further investigate
changes in effect estimates due to number of mother-child
pairs in the model we performed sensitivity analysis of ad-
justed model 1 with the population of adjusted model 2
(n = 17,130 instead of n = 45,389), and the results were
similar (Additional file 1: Table S6).
In addition, we run the same adjusted analyses as pre-
sented in models 1 in the tables after taking into account
that some children are siblings and they cluster within
the mother (Additional file 1: Table S7). All our esti-
mates remained unchanged.
Finally, the associattion between paternal cell phone
use and child’s neurodevelopmental outcomes at 3 and
5 years were in the same direction as observed for the
maternal cell phone use, but weaker (Additional file 1:
Table S8).
Discussion
Overall, we observed a lower risk of reduced sentence
complexity and low motor skills of 3 year-old children
being associated with maternal cell phone use in early
pregnancy compared with non-users. These associations
were confirmed by dose-response trends, even after ex-
cluding non-users. Our unique findings do not support
the hypothesis of adverse effects on children’s language,
communication and motor skills due to maternal cell
phone use during gestation.
The previous epidemiological studies investigating the
effect of early exposure to cell phone and children
cognitive and motor development in mother-child co-
horts report no associations [7, 9]. In these studies, the
outcomes were studied in infants and toddlers (≤3 y
ears), while our study also includes pre-school children
(5 years). Nevertheless, in the Spanish study cell phone
users had children who scored higher in the Bayley men-
tal scale and in the Danish study there was a trend for
lower risk for cognitive/language delay at 6 months

1.0) and for motor delay at 18 months (OR 0.9, 95% CI
0.8, 1.0), associated with maternal cell phone use. How-
ever discrepancies and similarities between studies can
be related to the characteristics of the included popula-
tion. The prevalence of non-users during pregnancy
(6%) in our study, was similar to Vrijheid et al. (11%)
(Spanish study) and Guxens et al. (6%) (Dutch study),
with recruitments between 2003 and 2006, but lower
than in Divan et al. (60%) (Danish study), with recruit-
ment from 1997 to 2002 [7–9]. The characteristics re-
lated to maternal use of cell phone during pregnancy
were similar to ours; younger women [6–9], highly edu-
cated, of higher socio-economic status [8, 9] and smokers
and alcohol consumers before pregnancy [8]. However, in
the studies by Divan et al., with adverse effects on child’s
behavior, cell phone use was related to lower socio-
economic status and higher maternal stress [5–7].
By investigating the specific groups in the Bishop-Dale
tool, we observed lower risks of having incomplete gram-
mar (i.e. “Children producing fairly complete sentences
with incomplete grammar”) and moderate language delay
(i.e. “Children producing short sentences”) in children of
cell phone users. The latter observed association was
higher (lower OR), but weaker (wider confidence inter-
vals) when we adjusted for maternal extrovert personality
score. We could assume that women could be divided into
“heavy talkers” and “moderate talkers”, regardless of extra-
version, and those women who talk a lot using their cell
phones might also talk a lot to their child, explaining the
association between heavy phone use and lack of reduced
sentence complexity in the children. Hence, enhanced
maternal-child communication among cell phone users
could explain our findings.
We found no association with severe delay in expres-
sive language or speech problems, as assessed by the

 Bishop-Dale tool, or severe delay in expressive/receptive
language as assessed by the ASQ. In a recent case-
control study of 77 cases of 3–5 year old children with
clinically diagnosed speech problems and 35 controls, a
higher prenatal exposure to cell phone was reported for
the cases, while it was not clear whether the authors ad-
justed for potential confounders [24].
The neurobiological substrate in fine and gross motor
development involves various parts of the brain includ-
ing the cerebral cortex, basal ganglia and the cerebellum.
Language processing functions are regulated through
multiple maturational mechanisms, but are increasingly
influenced by higher level cortical control. There are
several studies with animals exposed prenatally to vari-
ous regimes of mobile phone radiation. The exposure
depth of radiofrequency radiation is qualitatively differ-
ent in animals and humans, since the penetration depth
is limited and frequency dependent, implying that the
human brain will be structurally differently exposed
compared to a small animal (rat) brain, even at the same
power and distance to the source. Hence, fetal exposure to
maternal mobile phone use, and rats exposed to a mobile
phone during pregnancy, are not comparable. Different ex-
perimental studies of rats exposed during gestation to EMF
between 900 and 1800 MHz, via cell phones, provided no
evidence of exposure-related change in the offspring’s
hippocampus [25] and cerebellum [26] or cognitive deficits
[27] and effects on learning skills and behavior [28]. On the
other hand, prenatal and postnatal exposure to cell phone
produced EMF was related to changes in the numbers of
neurotransmitters [29, 30]. The concern for the human
health effects is mainly driven by the evidence from animal
studies but animal evidence is still inconsistent and the
relevance of these findings for humans is uncertain. To add
to the complexity of the issue, the estimation of fetus RF
exposure induced by wireless communication systems is

 highly complex because the exposure depends on many pa-
rameters (source, usage, frequency, posture, age of fetus).
Specific absorption models showed that the fetus is exposed
to various RF-EMF from the mother holding her cell phone
close to her head or her body, depending on the position of
the fetus and the pregnancy week [31].
The bias of unmeasured confounding is a possibility in
our study. Even though we have attempted to adjust for all
potential
confounders
by
including
important
socio-
demographic characteristics as well as maternal personality
and psychological factors, unmeasured confounding might
have affected our findings, i.e. genetic or other lifestyle fac-
tors. We have also performed several sensitivity analyses in
an attempt to evaluate associations in different population
strata. Hence, other unmeasured factors might be related to
a protective effect on the development of sentence complex-
ity and motor skills, rather than the prenatal cell phone use
in itself. Nevertheless, our findings make it less likely that
exposure to EMF from cell phone use during pregnancy
should be associated with adverse effects on neurodevelop-
ment. In addition, the observed associations between pater-
nal cell phone use and the studied outcomes in the child
were in the same direction as the maternal associations, sug-
gesting that the association may be caused by social back-
ground in general rather than by direct influence of mobile
phone use in pregnancy, given that the agreement between
maternal and paternal cell phone use was poor.
The large sample size is the main strength of our study
and together with the Danish study [7] these are the
largest studies investigating the association between ma-
ternal cell phone use and neurodevelopmental effects in
children. The adjustment for maternal extrovert person-
ality is a strength of our analysis, as well as the informa-
tion on maternal anxiety and/or depression assessment
during pregnancy. Finally, the span of the recruitment
years can be considered as a strength of this study as we
have had the opportunity to study the associations of
maternal cell phone use in periods of technological ad-
vance and increasing cell phone use. On the other hand,
changes on cell phone use over time can be considered a
limitation as well, as they can introduce bias in our
analysis. Nevertheless, when restricting to children born
earlier (1999–2004), between 2005 and 2006 and later
(2007–2009) when cell phone use may have been more
homogenous, similar results were found.
A main limitation of our study is the self-reported cell
phone use. The research group of the COSMOS study, a
large international prospective cohort study examining the
possible health effects of long-term cell phone use, found
59% perfect agreement between reported vs. traffic data of
call frequency [32]. Hence, our analyses could be affected
by misclassification bias. The misclassification of the expos-
ure due to errors in self-reported cell phone use would be
non-differential (ie, the same degree of misclassification to
both mothers of children with and without low language,
communication, motor skills), because this was a co-
hort study and use of cell phones was assessed long
before the neurodevelopmental assessment of the child.
Non-differential bias leads to attenuation of observed
associations, meaning that without such misclassification
the observed associations could have been stronger [33]. In
addition, we did not have information of cordless phone
use. The parental assessment of language development,
communication and motor skills of the children might also
have introduced a misclassification bias. However, in recent
studies in the MoBa, it was noted that delay in language de-
velopment as assessed by mother-filled questionnaires may
be a sensitive outcome of neurodevelopment following even
low grade exposure to known environmental neurotoxi-
cants during pregnancy [34, 35]. Finally, we did not investi-
gate possible health effects of the early age exposure to
EMF-RF from the offspring’s use cell phones.
Conclusions
For the first time we reported a beneficial association
between maternal cell phone use during pregnancy and the
child’s neurodevelopment, within a large prospective cohort
study. Limitations common in observational studies, in-
cluding unmeasured confounding are a probable explan-
ation of this association. Nevertheless, our findings provide
evidence that exposure to EMF-RF from cell phone during
pregnancy is not associated with adverse neurodevelopment
in the offspring at 3 or 5 years.
