Abstract
Background
Artificially sweetened beverage consumption has steadily increased in the last 40 years.
Several reviews examining the effects of artificially sweetened beverages on weight out-
comes have discrepancies in their results and conclusions.
Objectives
To determine whether risk of bias, results, and conclusions of reviews of effects of artificially
sweetened beverage consumption on weight outcomes differ depending on review spon-
sorship and authors’ financial conflicts of interest.
Methods
We performed a systematic review of reviews of the effects of artificially sweetened bever-
ages on weight. Two assessors independently screened articles for inclusion, extracted
data, and assessed risks of bias. We compared risk of bias, results and conclusions of
reviews by different industry sponsors, authors’ financial conflict of interest and journal
sponsor. We also report the concordance between review results and conclusions.
Results
Artificial sweetener industry sponsored reviews were more likely to have favorable results
(3/4) than non-industry sponsored reviews (1/23), RR: 17.25 (95% CI: 2.34 to 127.29), as

 well as favorable conclusions (4/4 vs. 15/23), RR: 1.52 (95% CI: 1.14 to 2.06). All reviews
funded by competitor industries reported unfavorable conclusions (4/4). In 42% of the
reviews (13/31), authors’ financial conflicts of interest were not disclosed. Reviews per-
formed by authors that had a financial conflict of interest with the food industry (disclosed in
the article or not) were more likely to have favorable conclusions (18/22) than reviews per-
formed by authors without conflicts of interest (4/9), RR: 7.36 (95% CI: 1.15 to 47.22). Risk
of bias was similar and high in most of the reviews.
Conclusions
Review sponsorship and authors’ financial conflicts of interest introduced bias affecting the
outcomes of reviews of artificially sweetened beverage effects on weight that could not be
explained by other sources of bias.
Introduction
The global obesity epidemic represents one of the biggest public health challenges of our time:
there are currently 600 million adults and 42 million children that are obese [1]. Overweight
and obesity are associated with increased risk for a variety of chronic and debilitating diseases
including cancer, cardiovascular disease and diabetes [2]. Once considered a problem only in
high-income countries, overweight and obesity are now dramatically on the rise in low- and
middle-income countries. People, particularly women, with less education and lower socio-
economic status are more likely to be obese [3].
While no single factor is responsible for the recent increases in overweight and obesity,
excess calories and inadequate physical activity are known determinants [4]. Added sugars are
a significant source of excess calories and sugar-sweetened beverages are one of the main
sources of added sugars, with an estimated 184 000 annual deaths attributable to their con-
sumption worldwide [5, 6]. Multiple agencies have recommended daily limits for added sugars
[7–9], as well as limitations on sugar sweetened beverage consumption [10].
Evidence of the adverse effects of added sugars on weight gain and obesity has fueled a
debate about whether they should be replaced by artificial sweeteners [11]. Artificially sweet-
ened beverage consumption, considered the main source of artificial sweeteners in the diet, has
dramatically increased in the last 40 years in children and adults [12–17]. However, the
replacement of added sugars with artificial sweeteners to prevent and control obesity is contro-
versial, due to safety concerns [18–20] and conflicting evidence on their effect on weight [7, 21,
22]. Some studies have shown that artificial sweeteners may negatively affect the gut micro-
biome and pathways associated with diabetes mellitus or obesity in both rodents and humans
[23–25]. Reverse causality has been proposed as a possible explanation for the discrepancies in
the evaluation of the effects on weight of artificially sweetened beverages, since individuals at
higher risk for weight gain may choose to consume artificially sweetened beverages in an
attempt to control their weight [26]. Some authors suggest that artificially sweetened beverage
consumption could lead to caloric compensation [27], while others suggest that satiety levels
do not differ between people consuming different sweeteners [28].
Another possible explanation for the conflicting results of studies of artificially sweetened
beverages may be bias related to funding source. Industry sponsorship of both original research
and review articles is associated with favorable outcomes for the sponsor in a variety of areas

 including clinical drug trials [29, 30], studies of the health effects of tobacco [31, 32], medical
procedures [33, 34] and pre-clinical animal studies [35, 36]. The observed bias related to fund-
ing is not explained by other risks of bias in the studies (for example sequence generation, con-
cealment of allocation, or loss to follow-up). In addition, bias may be related to funding source
even when all studies are industry-funded. For example, among industry-sponsored head-to-
head comparisons of statin drugs, the results favor the statin made by the company that spon-
sored the study [37].
Developers of public health guidelines have been adopting systematic review methods and
more structured methods for grading recommendations; assessing bias in the reviews is a criti-
cal step in the process [7, 38, 39]. The food and beverage industry frequently sponsors research
on the health effects of added sugars consumption and has produced reviews for policy pur-
poses. For example, the cane and beet sugar industry has lobbied public health organizations,
such as the World Health Organization, and produced reviews critical of the role of sugar in
dental caries, overweight and obesity, and atherosclerotic vascular disease [40, 41]. Reviews of
the health effects of sugar sweetened beverages that are performed by authors with financial
ties to food companies are five times more likely to conclude that there is no association of
sugar consumption with weight gain compared to those with other sponsors (relative risk: 5.0,
95% CI: 1.3–19.3)[42].
Low-calorie and caloric sweetener industries sponsor studies and reviews of the health
effects of artificially sweetened beverages. There is some evidence of funding bias in original
research studies. Walton has reported that among a sample of studies of aspartame, 100% of
the industry sponsored studies concluded that aspartame was safe, and 92% of the indepen-
dently funded studies identified adverse effects of aspartame consumption [43]. Millstone
observed that in a recent re-evaluation of aspartame safety by the European Food Safety
Authority, 97% of the studies that reported no harm were industry sponsored, while 100% of
the studies indicating possible harms were non-industry sponsored [44]. The relationship of
funding source and other biases to the outcomes of reviews of the effects of artificially sweet-
ened beverages on weight outcomes has not been evaluated.
The objectives of this systematic review are to determine whether risk of bias, results, and
conclusions of reviews of the effects of artificially sweetened beverage consumption on weight
outcomes differ depending on 1) sources of review sponsorship and 2) authors’ financial con-
flicts of interest.
Our a priori hypothesis is that review sponsorship and authors’ financial conflicts of interest
will be associated with results and conclusions that favor the sponsor’s product, and that risk of
bias will not differ by sponsor or author financial conflicts of interest.
Methods
The selection criteria for reviews, data extraction and analyses were determined a priori to data
collection. This research was exempt from Institutional Review Board approval as all the data
were publically available.
Inclusion / Exclusion Criteria for Reviews
We included published reviews that included human research studies comparing one or more
artificially sweetened beverages to water, sugar sweetened beverages or mixed comparisons
where the effects on weight were evaluated as a primary or secondary outcomes through BMI
score or other measures of overweight and obesity. Overweight is defined as BMI > 25 kg/m2
and obesity as BMI > 30 kg/m2.

 An article was included if its stated or implied purpose was to review the scientific evidence
on the effects of artificially sweetened beverage consumption on weight.
We included reviews that summarized data either quantitatively (with meta-analysis) or
qualitatively (without meta-analysis).
Reviews of studies on beverages containing artificial sweeteners currently listed as Generally
Recognized As Safe (GRAS) by the Food and Drug Administration [45] were included: acesul-
fame potassium (E950), aspartame (E951), salt of aspartame-acesulfame (E962), neotame
(E961), saccharin (E954), sucralose (E955).
Reviews on studies of beverages containing artificial sweeteners previously approved, but
currently not listed, as Generally Recognized As Safe (GRAS) by FDA were also included:
sodium cyclamate, (E952, banned by FDA in 1969, currently in use in UK, EU and other coun-
tries), dulcin (banned by FDA in 1950), P-4000 (banned by FDA in 1950).
We only included reviews where full text was available in English; however, no non-English
papers met the inclusion criteria.
A review was excluded if it assessed only the relationship between artificially sweetened bev-
erage consumption and health effects other than weight outcomes such as cardiovascular dis-
ease, satiety, diabetes or cancer. We excluded reviews where the artificial sweeteners studied
were only consumed in forms other than beverages. Only papers published in full were
included; we excluded letters to the editor, editorials and published conference presentations.
Search Methods for Identification Of Reviews
Electronic searches.
We searched the following databases: Pubmed (1946–2014), Embase
(1947–2014), Scopus (1823–2014), Web of Science (1840–2014), Sociological Abstracts (1952–
2014). Data last updated: 22 August 2014.
Search strategy.
We developed the search strategy with the assistance of a university
librarian. We used the strategy shown in S1 Appendix for Pubmed and adapted it for the other
databases.
Searching other resources.
We also searched author files, reference lists of included
papers and previous systematic reviews.
Selection of studies.
Two assessors (DM, CK) screened the titles and abstracts, when
available, of all retrieved records for obvious exclusions, and assessed the full text of the
remaining papers. Potentially eligible papers were sent to another assessor for final validation
of the inclusion criteria. Any disagreement was resolved by consensus (DM, CK, LB). Details
are reported in the “PRISMA Flow Chart” (Fig 1).
Data Collection and Analysis
Two assessors (DM, CK) independently extracted data from included reviews on 1) review
characteristics, 2) review outcomes, 3) risk of bias of the review 4) primary outcomes for this
analysis: a) favorable results and b) favorable conclusions 5) review funding sources, 6) authors’
financial conflicts of interests, and 7) journal characteristics. Discrepancies were resolved by
discussion with a third coder (LB). Unresolved discrepancies were coded as unclear. Data
extracted and assessors evaluations for each review are reported in S2 Appendix.
Review characteristics
• Artificial sweetener(s) studied

 Review outcomes
• Weight outcomes assessed (BMI; other measure of weight gain; other measure of obesity)
• Adverse outcomes assessed (diabetes; hypertension)
Weight and adverse outcomes were extracted only if specified by the authors in the text of the
review.
Risk of bias
To assess risk of bias in the included reviews, we used the criteria used for Cochrane reviews on
funding bias[46]:
• whether explicit and “well defined” criteria that could be replicated by others were used to
select studies for inclusion/exclusion in the review (yes/no/unclear)
• whether there was an adequate study inclusion method, with two or more assessors selecting
studies (yes/no/unclear)
• whether the search for studies was comprehensive (yes/no/unclear)
• whether methodological differences and other characteristics that could introduce bias were
controlled (yes/no/unclear)
Overall risk of bias was coded as 1) “low” if at least three of the four criteria were met. In
any other case risk of bias was coded as 2) “high.”
Primary Outcomes for this Analysis
• Results (favorable/unfavorable)
First, results were extracted separately for each population studied (healthy adults; non
healthy adults; children) in each review and coded as “positive” or “negative.”
For each population results were defined as:
a. Positive: if more than 50 percent of the studies considered in the review reported that
artificially sweetened beverage consumption in a population was associated with: a) sta-
tistically significant lower BMI score, overweight or obesity rate or no change compared
to water; b) statistically significant lower BMI score, overweight or obesity rate compared
to sugar-sweetened or other caloric beverages.
b. Negative: if more than 50 percent of the studies considered in the review reported that
artificially sweetened beverage consumption in a population was associated with: a) sta-
tistically significant higher BMI score, overweight or obesity rate when compared to
water; b) statistically significant higher BMI score, overweight or obesity rate or no
change compared to sugar-sweetened or other caloric beverages.
c. Mixed: if the studies included in the review: a) did not report the results or 2) more than
50% of the studies did not fit the definition of “positive” or “negative”.
Second, the overall review results were coded as “favorable” or “unfavorable”. Overall
results were defined as:
1. Favorable: if only positive results were reported for all the study populations considered
in the review

6 / 20
 2. Unfavorable: if “negative” or “mixed” results were reported within one or more popula-
tions considered in the review. Mixed results were considered to be unfavorable based on
the public health perspective which suggests that an exposure is unfavorable even if only
one subpopulation is affected.
• Conclusions (favorable/unfavorable)
Conclusions were defined as:
1. Favorable: if authors stated or implied in their conclusions that a) artificially sweetened
beverage consumption was definitely or probably associated with decreased weight, BMI,
or obesity or no change, b) artificially sweetened beverages consumption was associated
with increased weight, BMI, or obesity, but the association was attributed to poor study
design or bias, or c) the evidence was inconclusive. Articles concluding that the evidence
was inconclusive were classified as favorable because this conclusion is consistent with
an acceptance of the null hypothesis that there is no relationship between artificially
sweetened beverage consumption and increased BMI score, overweight or obesity rate.
2. Unfavorable: if the authors stated or implied in their conclusions that artificially sweet-
ened beverages were definitely or probably associated with increased weight, BMI or
obesity.
Review funding source
• Names of disclosed funding sources
• Type(s) of funding source disclosed were coded as 1) food industry (subcategories: artificial
sweetener industry, cane and beet sugar industry, other food industry), 2) government, 3)
private non-profit, 4) other, or 5) no funding disclosed.
Organizations that could not be clearly classified into the above categories were coded based
on the main funding sources for the organization, determined through a Google search.
• For reviews with a disclosed industry funder, the role of the funding source was coded as 1)
not stated, 2) sponsor not involved, or 3) sponsor involved.
Authors’ financial conflicts of interest
• Authors’ names
• Number of authors
• Number of authors with a financial conflict of interest (disclosed in the paper or not)
• Number of authors without a financial conflict of interest
Financial conflicts of interest of the review authors were coded as 1) yes, disclosed in the paper,
2) yes, not disclosed in the paper, 3) no disclosure statement, and 4) no financial conflicts of
interest.
Financial conflicts of interest were defined per the July 2010 version of the International
Committee of Medical Journal Editors [47] uniform disclosure form for potential conflicts of
interest and included: current or former board membership, current or former consultancy
work, current or former industry employment, expert testimony, industry grants (issued or
pending), payment for lectures including service on speakers bureaus, payment for manuscript

 preparation, patents (planned, pending, or issued), royalties, payment for development of edu-
cational presentations, stock or stock options, and travel reimbursement, or other relations
with relevant industries. For this study, relevant industries were defined as the food and bever-
age industry including trade groups and organizations such as the International Life Sciences
Institute (ILSI).
We used a modification of a previous method to identify undisclosed financial conflicts of
interest of authors [48]. For reviews where the authors did not provide a financial disclosure
(“no disclosure statement”) or disclosed no financial conflict of interest (“no financial conflict
of interest”), we searched the name of the authors in the European Food Safety Authority dec-
laration of interests database, Center for Science in the Public Interest database, disclosures in
other articles identified in Pubmed, Google, acknowledgments in other articles gathered for
this study and their Curriculum Vitae. If a relevant conflict of interest was discovered using
this search strategy, the search was discontinued and the author was classified as having a
financial conflict of interest (“yes, not disclosed in the paper”).
Journal characteristics
• Title
• Year and month published
• Journal name
• Peer-reviewed (yes/no)
• Journal funding (food industry/ mixed/ non-food industry)
Journal funding was defined as:
1. Food industry: if the journal or the scientific society associated with the journal was directly
funded by the food and beverage industry, including trade groups and organizations such as
the ILSI.
2. Mixed: if the journal or associated scientific society disclosed any funding or relationship
(for example serving as press office or providing communication services other than adver-
tising to companies) with the food industry.
3. Non-food industry: in any other case.
Analysis
Primary analyses.
1) We compared risk of bias and the number of favorable results and
conclusions in reviews with artificial sweetener industry sponsorship to those with other
sources of sponsorship. We hypothesized that reviews sponsored by the artificial sweetener
industry would be more likely to have high risk of bias and results and conclusions that favored
the artificial sweetener industry compared to reviews sponsored by other sources.
We conducted an a priori subgroup analysis comparing risk of bias, results and conclusions
of reviews with different industry sponsors (for example, cane and beet sugar industry spon-
sored reviews vs artificial sweetener industry sponsored reviews).
2) We compared risk of bias, results and conclusions of reviews that had one or more
authors with financial conflicts of interests to reviews that had authors with none. We hypothe-
sized that reviews that had authors with financial conflicts of interest would be more likely to

 have high risk of bias and results and conclusions that favored the artificial sweetener industry
compared to reviews that had authors with no financial conflicts of interest.
Secondary analyses.
1) We also report the concordance between review results and con-
clusions as previous research has shown that industry sponsored studies are less likely to have
results and conclusions that agree compared to non-industry sponsored studies [30]. We
hypothesized that industry sponsorship and authors’ financial conflicts of interest would be
associated with discordant results and conclusions (with results unfavorable toward artificially
sweetened beverages and conclusions favorable toward artificially sweetened beverages).
2) We compared risk of bias, results and conclusions of reviews published in industry spon-
sored journals with those published in non-industry sponsored journals. We hypothesized that
reviews published in industry sponsored journals would be more likely to have high risk of bias
and results and conclusions that favored the artificial sweetener industry compared to reviews
published in other journals.
Sensitivity analyses. Reviews with no disclosed funding sources may have been funded by
industry. Therefore, we performed a sensitivity analysis excluding the reviews with no funding
disclosed from the non-industry sponsored group.
Statistical analysis.
Risk Ratios (RR) were calculated for all primary and secondary analy-
ses with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Four reviews conducted meta-analyses, but we were
unable to extract quantitative effect estimates that could be combined into a pooled effect size
because of the different study designs and populations considered.
Results
Search results
After removal of duplicates, 493 references were identified and 31 reviews were included fol-
lowing full text screening (Fig 1, PRISMA Flow Diagram).
Review characteristics
The 31 reviews were published between 1978 and 2014. Table 1 shows review characteristics by
review funding source. Four reviews were funded by the artificial sweetener industry (ILSI, Aji-
nomoto Company, International Sweetener Association). Four were funded by the sugar or
water industries and classified as competitor industries. Eleven disclosed non-industry funding
and 13 disclosed no funding sources; these 2 groups were combined for analysis. Of the 18
reviews with disclosed funding sources, 10 stated that the sponsor was involved at some stage
during the development of the manuscript.
Four reviews included meta-analyses. Only 6 reviews stated how many studies were
included in the review. Weight outcomes assessed in the reviews include BMI, other measures
of weight gain, and other measures of obesity. Adverse outcomes addressed in the reviews
include diabetes (n = 17) and hypertension (n = 5).
Data extracted for each review are available in S2 Appendix.
Risk of bias. Agreement on coding of risk of bias by the two assessors was achieved for all
reviews. Most of the included reviews had high or unclear risks of bias for each criterion (See
Fig 2 and S3 Appendix). Eleven reviews reported their inclusion/exclusion criteria; only two
reviews included two or more assessors for the evaluation of the evidence; six reviews included
a comprehensive search strategy. The majority of the reviews (26/31) were coded as overall
high risk of bias.
Journal characteristics.
Twenty-seven reviews were published in peer-reviewed journals.
We identified nineteen reviews published in non-industry funded journals and twelve reviews
that were published in industry or mixed funded journals. Most reviews included studies on

 multiple artificial sweeteners; 6 included studies on only one artificial sweetener (5 on aspar-
tame only, 1 saccharin only).
Relationship between review sponsorship and risk of bias
The proportion of artificial sweetener industry sponsored reviews with overall high risk of bias
(3/4) is similar to the proportion of non-industry sponsored reviews (included reviews with no
funding disclosed) (20/23) RR: 0.86 (95% CI: 0.48 to 1.55) and competitor industry sponsored

 reviews (3/4) RR: 1.00 (95% CI: 0.44 to 2.22). We performed a sensitivity analysis excluding the
reviews with no funding disclosed from the non-industry sponsored group. The proportion of
artificial sweetener industry sponsored reviews with overall high risk of bias (3/4) remained
similar to the proportion of government and private non-profit reviews with high risk of bias
(6/10), RR: 1.25 (95% CI: 0.58 to 2.67).
Relationship between review sponsorship and review results
The results, reported in Table 2 show that artificial sweetener industry sponsored reviews were
more likely to have favorable results (3/4) than non-industry sponsored reviews (included
reviews with no funding disclosed) (1/23), RR: 17.25 (95% CI: 2.34 to 127.29). We performed a
sensitivity analysis excluding the reviews with no funding disclosed from the non-industry
sponsored group. Artificial sweetener industry sponsored reviews still were more likely to have
favorable results (3/4) than government and private no profit (1/10), RR: 7.5 (95% CI: 1.07 to
52.37).
Then we compared results reported in artificial sweetener industry sponsored reviews with
competitor industry sponsored reviews. A greater proportion of artificial sweetener industry
sponsored reviews had favorable results (3/4) compared to competitor industry sponsored
reviews (0/4).
We could not reach consensus on the results of 12 reviews. The results of these reviews were
so confusing or were presented so incompletely that coding the results according to our criteria
would require extensive interpretation by the authors (assessors evaluation reported in S2
Appendix). Therefore, these results were coded as “unclear”(see Methods). Industry sponsored
(3/8) and non-industry sponsored (9/23) reviews had a similar risk of reporting unclear results
RR: 0.70 (95% CI: 0.32 to 1.55).
Relationship between review sponsorship and review conclusions
Artificial sweetener industry sponsored reviews were more likely to have favorable conclusions
(4/4) than non-industry sponsored reviews (included reviews with no funding disclosed) (15/
23), RR: 1.52 (95% CI: 1.14 to 2.06) (Table 2). We performed a sensitivity analysis excluding
the reviews with no funding disclosed from the non-industry sponsored group. Artificial sweet-
ener industry sponsored reviews were still more likely to have favorable conclusions (4/4) than
government and private non-profit (7/10), although this was not statistically significant RR:
1.42 (95% CI: 0.95 to 2.14).

 All four reviews funded by competitors of the artificial sweetener industry reported unfavor-
able conclusions (4/4) and all four reviews funded by the artificial sweetener industry had
favorable conclusions, RR: 1 (95% CI: NaN to 1).
Relationship between author financial conflict of interest and risk of bias
Reviews performed by authors with conflicts of interest had similar overall high risk of bias to
reviews performed by authors without conflicts of interest RR: 0.92 (95% CI: 0.68 to 1.25).
Eight of 9 reviews by authors without conflicts of interest had a high risk of bias, compared to
18 of 22 reviews by authors with conflicts of interest.
Relationship between author financial conflicts of interest and review
results
Table 3 summarizes the financial conflicts of interests of review authors. Authors of 42% (13/
31) of reviews had conflicts of interest that were not disclosed in the article; most of these
(n = 8) were in reviews that also had no disclosed funding sources. Most reviews were lacking
disclosure statements for authors (19/31), regardless of whether the authors had a financial
conflict of interest with the food industry (13/22) or not (6/9), with a similar likelihood of
reporting between the two groups RR: 1.77 (95% CI: 0.66 to 4.76).
For 55% (17/31) of reviews, more than half of the authors had conflicts of interest with the
food or beverage industry.
To test our hypothesis that reviews performed by authors with a conflict of interest with the
food industry are more likely to report favorable results, we compared the 9 reviews including
only authors that had no conflicts of interest with the food industry with 22 reviews performed
by authors with disclosed or non-disclosed conflicts of interest (Table 4). None of the nine
reviews performed by authors without conflicts of interest reported favorable results; whereas 4
reviews with authors with conflicts of interest had favorable results RR: 1 (95% CI: NaN to 1).
Reviews performed by authors with a conflict of interest with the food industry were more
likely to report unclear results (11/22) than reviews performed by authors without conflicts of
interest (1/8) RR: 4.50 (95% CI: 0.68 to 29.92).
Relationship between author financial conflict of interest and review
conclusions
Reviews performed by authors with a conflict of interest with the food industry were more
likely to have favorable conclusions (18/22) than reviews performed by authors without

 conflicts of interest (4/9), RR: 7.36 (95% CI: 1.15 to 47.22). Notably, the only reviews performed
by authors with conflicts of interest that reported unfavorable conclusions were all funded by
competitor industries (4/4).
Relationship of author financial conflicts of interest with concordance of
review results and conclusion
All reviews that reported favorable conclusions and discordant (unfavorable) results were con-
ducted by authors with conflicts of interest (5/5). None of these five reviews were sponsored by
industry. All the reviews that reported favorable conclusions and concordant (favorable) results
were performed by authors with financial conflicts of interest (4/4) and the majority were
funded by the artificial sweetener industry (3/4). Of the ten reviews that reported unfavorable
conclusions and concordant (unfavorable) results, eight were prepared by authors without con-
flicts of interest and two by authors with conflicts of interest (and funded by artificial sweetener
competitor industries). Reviews by authors with conflicts of interest were less likely to have
concordant results and conclusion than reviews by authors without conflicts of interest RR:
0.55 (95% CI: 0.32 to 0.94) (Table 3).
The relationship of source of sponsorship and concordance of review results and conclu-
sion could not be calculated because of the small samples size and the high number of reviews
with unclear results sponsored by the artificial sweetener (1/4) and competitor (2/4) indus-
tries (Table 2).
Relationship between journal funding and risk of bias
Reviews published in industry or mixed funding journals had similar overall high risk of bias
to reviews published in non-industry funded journals RR: 0.92 (95% CI: 0.68 to 1.25).
Relationship between Journal Funding and Review Results
Only one review published in a non-industry funded journal reported favorable results (1/19)
compared to 3/12 reviews published in journals with industry or mixed funding (Table 5).
Reviews published in journals with industry or mixed funding were as likely to report favorable
results (3/12) as reviews published in non-industry funded journals (1/19) RR: 4.75 (95% CI:
0.56 to 40.56).

 Relationship between journal funding and review conclusions
Almost all the reviews published in industry or mixed funded journals reported favorable con-
clusions (11/12) (Table 5). Reviews published in industry and mixed funded journals more
often had favorable conclusions (11/12) than reviews published in non-industry funded jour-
nals (8/19) RR: 2.18 (95% CI: 1.25 to 3.79).
Discussion
Our findings show that review sponsorship, financial conflicts of interests of authors and journal
funding are all associated with favorable outcomes related to the effects of artificially sweetened
beverages on weight outcomes. Reviews sponsored by the artificial sweetener industry were more
likely to report results and conclusions that favored artificially sweetened beverages than non-
industry sponsored reviews. We also found that reviews performed by authors with a conflict of
interest with the food industry were more likely to have results and conclusions that favored arti-
ficially sweetened beverages than reviews performed by authors without financial conflicts of
interest. Reviews performed by authors with financial conflicts of interest also were more likely
to report unclear results and to lack concordance between results and conclusions. The lack of
concordance was primarily due to the reviews having favorable conclusions when the results
were unclear or not favorable. Thus, authors with financial conflicts of interest with the food
industry were more likely to put a positive “spin” on the conclusions of their reviews [49].
Our study is consistent with similar recent findings that the main global sweetener pro-
ducer, the cane and beet sugar industry, also supports research that favors their product.
Reviews of the health effects of sugar sweetened beverages performed by authors with financial
ties to the sugar industry are five times more likely to conclude there is no association of sugar
consumption with weight gain [42]. Our results are also in line with the consolidated evidence
that industry sponsorship of various types of research is associated with favorable outcomes for
the sponsor in both human [29, 31–34] and animal studies[35, 36].
We also found that reviews performed by artificial sweetener industry competitors (e.g. the
sugar industry) were more likely to have unfavorable results and conclusions on the effects of
artificially sweetened beverages on weight than artificial sweetener industry sponsored reviews
and non-industry sponsored reviews. These findings suggest that fair evaluations of safety and
effectiveness of products might be potentially undermined by reviews on a product performed
by competitors. Therefore, competitor funding should be considered as a source of bias in
reviews of a product.
Moreover, we showed that reviews published in journals funded partially or in full by the
food industry more often have conclusions that are favorable towards artificially sweetened
Table 5. Results and conclusions of reviews by journal funding (n = 31).

 beverages than reviews published in non-industry funded journals. The role of the funding of
journals and its effects on study outcomes has been rarely investigated, and early (and recent)
warnings on the risk of transforming healthcare, environmental and toxicological journals into
marketing instruments have been largely ignored [50–53].
Notably, the differences in the results and conclusions that we observed related to sponsor-
ship, author conflicts of interest and journal funding cannot be explained by differences in the
risks of bias in how the reviews were conducted. Risk of bias of the reviews was high in all com-
parison groups. To reduce bias, reviews of the effects of artificial sweeteners on weight need
improvement in their search strategies, data collection and assessment of included studies. In
addition, the majority of the reviews were published in peer-reviewed journals. Although peer
review can be a valuable tool for increasing the quality of scientific publication [54], it is not
sufficient to mitigate the observed influence of study sponsorship, conflict of interest and jour-
nal funding on review results and conclusions.
Almost half of the reviews had authors that failed to disclose relevant conflicts of interest
with the food industry. This lack of disclosure is consistent with the lack of transparency and
compliance with conflict of interest disclosure policies reported in several fields [48, 55–58].
Thus, disclosures in journals do not give an accurate assessment of authors’ conflicts of interest.
Further investigation of authors’ financial ties using different databases, disclosures made in
other research articles, and additional resources may be necessary to provide a more accurate
description than a single declaration of interest within a single publication. In addition, jour-
nals need to enforce their disclosure requirements and penalize authors who fail to disclose.
The WHO/IARC, the US Institute of Medicine, the ICMJE and the Collegium Ramazzini have
all pointed out the need for transparency and accountability in policies for declaration of inter-
est [47, 59–62]. The US National Library of Medicine was also recently urged to include infor-
mation about authors’ competing interests in the abstracts of articles submitted to PubMed,
the library’s online database of biomedical literature [63].
Our systematic review had limitations related to the conduct and reporting of the included
reviews, as well as the small sample size of studies available. Our analysis relies on how
included reviews defined “funding” and “financial conflict of interest of the authors” and we
cannot exclude the possibility that other financial interests and other sources of funding were
present. In addition, we categorized industry funding into artificial sweetener industry, com-
petitor industry and other industry. This is necessary because the interests of these different
corporate sponsors differ, but it resulted in small number of reviews in each category. Also, cat-
egorizing funding sources in the food industry is complicated. For example, we categorized the
American Diabetes Association as non-profit. However, the ADA is supported by a variety of
companies (e.g. Johnson and Johnson, Nutrisystem) that produce or sell artificial sweeteners,
as reported also by CSPI [64–66]. We conducted additional analyses where we categorized the
American Diabetes Association as the artificial sweetener industry and this did not change the
observed association of artificial sweetener industry funding with the results or conclusions of
the reviews.
There is increasing momentum towards the inclusion of funding source and author conflicts
of interest as a risk of bias domain for evidence-based evaluation. The Navigation Guide
already includes both as a risk of bias domain in both human and animal studies [67, 68], while
Cochrane and GRADE are considering it, but have not yet adopted it [69]. According to the
US Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality and the US National Toxicology Program,
funding source is recommended as a factor to consider when evaluating risk of bias of individ-
ual studies for selective reporting and then again for evaluating the body of evidence for publi-
cation bias [67, 68, 70]. The US Food and Drug Administration and the European Food Safety
Authority, that evaluate safety and risks of food consumption, both pre and post marketing,

 including effects on weight of sweeteners, and eventually establish an Acceptable Daily Intake
(ADI) [71–73] were recently criticized for the number of panelists with financial interests rais-
ing concerns on the integrity and transparency of their evaluation processes [74–76]. The
Advisory Committee of the Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2015–2020 considered several
reviews, but did not assess funding source as a risk of bias [7]. Our results confirm that funding
source and conflicts of interest are a source of bias in reviews that cannot be detected by other
risk of bias rating criteria.
Conclusion
Our systematic review shows that financial conflicts of interest introduced a bias at all levels of
the research and publication process (author financial ties, review sponsorship and journal
funding), affecting the outcomes of reviews and possibly undermining the quality and trans-
parency of public health evaluations that are reliant on these reviews. The bias introduced by
financial interests could not be ascribed to the overall risk of bias of the reviews and was not
prevented by the peer review process.
