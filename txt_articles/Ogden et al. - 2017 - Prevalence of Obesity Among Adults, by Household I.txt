Studies have suggested that obesity prevalence varies by 
income and educational level, although patterns might dif-
fer between high-income and low-income countries (1–3). 
Previous analyses of U.S. data have shown that the prevalence 
of obesity varied by income and education, but results were 
not consistent by sex and race/Hispanic origin (4). Using data 
from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 
(NHANES), CDC analyzed obesity prevalence among adults 
(aged ≥20 years) by three levels of household income, based 
on percentage (≤130%, >130% to ≤350%, and >350%) 
of the federal poverty level (FPL) and individual education 
level (high school graduate or less, some college, and college 
graduate). During 2011–2014, the age-adjusted prevalence of 
obesity among adults was lower in the highest income group 
(31.2%) than the other groups (40.8% [>130% to ≤350%] 
and 39.0% [≤130%]). The age-adjusted prevalence of obesity 
among college graduates was lower (27.8%) than among those 
with some college (40.6%) and those who were high school 
graduates or less (40.0%). The patterns were not consistent 
across all sex and racial/Hispanic origin subgroups. Continued 
progress is needed to achieve the Healthy People 2020 targets 
of reducing age-adjusted obesity prevalence to <30.5% and 
reducing disparities (5).
NHANES is a biannual cross-sectional survey designed to 
monitor the health and nutritional status of the civilian non-
institutionalized U.S. population (6). The survey consists of 
in-home interviews and standardized physical examinations 
conducted in mobile examination centers. During the physi-
cal examination, standardized measurements of weight and 
height were obtained. Body mass index (BMI) was calculated 
as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared. 
Obesity was defined as a BMI ≥30 kg/m2. The NHANES 
sample is selected through a complex, multistage probability 
design. Participants self-reported race/Hispanic origin, and 
were divided into five categories: non-Hispanic white, non-
Hispanic black, non-Hispanic Asian, Hispanic and “other.” 
During 2011–2014, non-Hispanic black, non-Hispanic Asian, 
and Hispanic persons, among other groups, were oversampled. 
A total of 308 non-Hispanic persons reporting other races or 
more than one race were placed in an “other” category, and 
their data were included in the overall results. The NHANES 
examination response rate for adults aged ≥20 years was 64.5% 
in the 2011–2012 survey and 63.7% in the 2013–2014 survey.
Household income was categorized using FPL information, 
which accounts for inflation and family size (https://aspe.
hhs.gov/prior-hhs-poverty-guidelines-and-federal-register-
references); income levels were designated as ≤130%, >130%

to ≤350%, and >350% of FPL. The cut point for participation 
in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program is 130% of 
the poverty level, and 350% provides relatively equal sample 
sizes for each of the three income groups. Education was 
categorized as high school graduate or less, some college, and 
college graduate.
All estimates were adjusted to account for the complex survey 
design, including examination sample weights. Estimates were 
age-adjusted to the 2000 projected U.S. Census population 
using the age groups 20–39, 40–59, and ≥60 years. Confidence 
intervals for estimates were calculated using the Wald method. 
Differences between income and education groups were tested 
using a two-sided, univariate t-statistic, with statistical sig-
nificance defined as a p-value of <0.05. Temporal trends from 
1999–2002 to 2011–2014 were analyzed using orthogonal 
contrasts and 2-year survey cycles. Pregnant women (122) 
and participants with missing weight or height (571) were 
excluded, resulting in a total sample size of 10,636 for the 
period 2011–2014. For estimates by FPL, an additional 851 
participants were excluded because of missing FPL data, and 
for estimates by education, eight participants were excluded 
because information on education was missing.
During 2011–2014, the age-adjusted prevalence of obesity 
was 38.3% among women and 34.3% among men (Table). 
The prevalence of obesity was 34.5% among non-Hispanic 
white adults, 48.1% among non-Hispanic black adults, 
11.7% among non-Hispanic Asian adults, and 42.5% among 
Hispanic adults.
Among women, prevalence was lower in the highest income 
group (29.7%) than in the middle (42.9%) and lowest 
(45.2%) income groups. This pattern was observed among 
non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic Asian, and Hispanic 
women, but it was only significant for white women. Among 
non-Hispanic black women, there was no difference in obesity 
prevalence among the income groups.
Among men, the prevalence of obesity was lower in both the 
lowest (31.5%) and highest (32.6%) income groups compared 
with the middle-income group (38.5%). This pattern was seen 
among both non-Hispanic white and Hispanic men, although 
among non-Hispanic white men, the difference between the 
highest-income and middle-income groups was not statistically 
significant. Among non-Hispanic black men, obesity preva-
lence was higher in the highest income group (42.7%) than in 
the lowest income group (33.8%). There was no difference in 
obesity prevalence by income among non-Hispanic Asian men.
In 2011–2014, the prevalence of obesity was lower among 
women and men who were college graduates (27.8% [women], 
27.9% [men]) than among women and men with some col-
lege (41.2%, 40.0%) and women and men who were high 
school graduates or less (45.3%, 35.5%). By race/Hispanic 
origin, the same pattern was seen among non-Hispanic white, 
non-Hispanic black, and Hispanic women, and also among 
non-Hispanic white men, although the differences were not 
all statistically significant. Although the difference was not 
statistically significant among non-Hispanic black men, obe-
sity prevalence increased with educational attainment. Among

non-Hispanic Asian women and men and Hispanic men there 
were no differences in obesity prevalence by education level.
From 1999–2002 to 2011–2014 the prevalence of obesity 
increased among women in the two lower income groups, but not 
among women living in households with incomes above 350% of 
FPL. Obesity prevalence increased among men in all three income 
groups during this period (Figure 1). Obesity prevalence also 
increased among both women and men in all education groups 
except men who were college graduates (Figure 2).
Discussion
During 2011–2014, the relationships between obesity and 
income, and obesity and education were complex, differing among 
population subgroups. Whereas overall obesity prevalence decreased 
with increased levels of income and educational attainment among 
women, the association was more complex among men.
Similar to results based on data from 2005–2008 (4), dur-
ing 2011–2014, obesity prevalence was lower in the highest 
income group among women, but this was not the case among 
men. In fact, among non-Hispanic black men the prevalence 
of obesity was higher in the highest income group than in the 
lowest income group. Both women and men who were college 
graduates, on the other hand, had lower prevalences of obesity 
than did persons with less education.
In general, prevalence of obesity among women was low-
est among college graduates, although among non-Hispanic 
Asians there was no difference in prevalence by level of educa-
tion. This relationship was not seen when obesity was examined 
by income level. For example, obesity prevalence was lower in 
the highest income group among non-Hispanic white women, 
but among non-Hispanic black women, prevalence did not 
differ between the highest and lowest household income 
groups. In contrast, among both non-Hispanic black women 
and non-Hispanic white women, the prevalence of obesity was 
lower among college graduates than among women with some 
college. This difference in the relationship between obesity and

income and obesity and education has been reported in at least 
one other study (7) in children. These findings demonstrate 
that lower levels of income and education are not universally 
associated with obesity; the association is complex and differs 
by sex and race/Hispanic origin.
This is the first report to describe differences in obesity preva-
lence by income and education among non-Hispanic Asian 
adults. There were no significant differences in prevalence by 
income or education among either non-Hispanic Asian women 
or men; however, there was a pattern of decreasing prevalence 
with increasing income among non-Hispanic Asian women. 
The findings in this report are subject to at least two limi-
tations. First, BMI is a proxy for body fat and BMI ≥30 was 
applied to persons in all racial/Hispanic origin groups, which 
might result in underestimating health risks for certain popu-
lations. For example, it has been suggested that the BMI cut 
point (≥30 kg/m2) that typically defines obesity might be 
too high for Asians and underestimate associated health risks 
(8,9). Second, the small sample size among some subgroups 
reduced the ability to detect differences when differences exist. 
Additional years of data might provide more information about 
obesity prevalence by income, especially among non-Hispanic 
Asian women.
Trends in obesity prevalence over time show that differences 
by income and education have existed at least since 1999–2002 
among women. Among men, college graduates have consis-
tently had a lower prevalence of obesity, whereas differences 
by household income have been less consistent. Further study 
is needed to understand the reasons for the different patterns 
by sex and race/Hispanic origin in the relationship between 
obesity and income or education.

Summary
What is already known about this topic?
Studies have suggested that obesity prevalence varies by 
income or education, although patterns might differ in high 
and low income countries.
What is added by this report?
Analysis of data from the 2011–2014 National Health and 
Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) examining the 
association between obesity and education and obesity and 
income among U.S. adults demonstrate that obesity prevalence 
patterns by income vary between women and men and by race/
Hispanic origin. The prevalence of obesity decreased with 
increasing income in women (from 45.2% to 29.7%), but there 
was no difference in obesity prevalence between the lowest 
(31.5%) and highest (32.6%) income groups among men. 
Moreover, obesity prevalence was lower among college 
graduates than among persons with less education for 
non-Hispanic white women and men, non-Hispanic black 
women, and Hispanic women, but not for non-Hispanic Asian 
women and men or non-Hispanic black or Hispanic men. The 
association between obesity and income or educational level is 
complex and differs by sex, and race/non-Hispanic origin.
What are the implications for public health practice?
NHANES will continue to be an important source of data on 
disparities in obesity prevalence. These data will help track the 
Healthy People 2020 objective of reducing obesity disparities and 
might inform CDC, state, or local obesity prevention programs.
