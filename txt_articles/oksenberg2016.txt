Summary
A major driver of the pathophysiology of sickle cell disease (SCD) is poly-
merization of deoxygenated haemoglobin S (HbS), which leads to sickling
and destruction of red blood cells (RBCs) and end-organ damage. Pharma-
cologically increasing the proportion of oxygenated HbS in RBCs may inhi-
bit
polymerization,
prevent
sickling
and
provide
long
term
disease
modification. We report that GBT440, a small molecule which binds to the
N-terminal a chain of Hb, increases HbS affinity for oxygen, delays in vitro
HbS polymerization and prevents sickling of RBCs. Moreover, in a murine
model of SCD, GBT440 extends the half-life of RBCs, reduces reticulocyte
counts and prevents ex vivo RBC sickling. Importantly, oral dosing of
GBT440 in animals demonstrates suitability for once daily dosing in
humans and a highly selective partitioning into RBCs, which is a key thera-
peutic safety attribute. Thus, GBT440 has the potential for clinical use as a
disease-modifying agent in sickle cell patients.

Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an inherited disorder that affects
millions of people worldwide. It is caused by a point muta-
tion in HBB (b-globin gene) leading to production of HbS
that polymerizes under hypoxic conditions and leads to the
formation of sickled red blood cells (SS RBC). Sickle cell
disease is characterized by haemolytic anaemia, vaso-occlu-
sion and a vasculopathy that leads to progressive end-organ
damage (Bunn, 1997; Rees et al, 2010). The current treat-
ments for SCD include the use of hydroxycarbamide (also
termed hydroxyurea) (Marcus et al, 1997; Brandow & Pane-
pinto, 2013), blood transfusions (Wahl & Quirolo, 2009)
and palliative therapy during vaso-occlusive crises, but, due
to their shortcomings, chronic preventive treatment remains
a serious unmet medical need (Steinberg, 1999). Strategies
to treat SCD include fetal haemoglobin (HbF) induction
(Steinberg
&
Rodgers,
2001),
polymerization
inhibition
(Sunshine et al, 1978), SS RBC hydration (Ataga et al,
2011) and prevention of RBC and white blood cell adhesion
(Manwani & Frenette, 2013; Telen et al, 2015). Prevention
of painful crises and chronic tissue injury in SCD will
require inhibition of HbS polymerization in RBCs. As oxy-
genated haemoglobin (oxyHb) is a potent inhibitor of HbS
polymerization, increasing the proportion of oxyHbS in
RBCs without compromising oxygen delivery is a promising
strategy
for
preventing
RBC
sickling
and
subsequently
achieving long-term disease modification (Noguchi et al,
1988). Similar to oxyHb, HbF is a potent inhibitor of HbS
polymerization
(Sunshine
et al,
1978;
Mozzarelli
et al,
1987). Studies in individuals with compound heterozygosity
for HbS and pancellular hereditary persistence of fetal hae-
moglobin (S/HPFH) infer that the presence of 10–30% HbF
provides clinical benefits with patients having few, if any,

 sickle cell-related events (Akinsheye et al, 2011). A variety
of allosteric modulators that increase the affinity of haemo-
globin for oxygen (Hb-O2 affinity) have been identified
(Safo & Kato, 2014), including aromatic aldehydes such as
5-hydroxymethylfurfural (5-HMF), (Abdulmalik et al, 2005)
tucaresol (Arya et al, 1996) and BW12C (Beddell et al,
1984). These molecules reversibly bind to Hb and preferen-
tially stabilize the Relaxed (R) state (oxyHb) in relation to
the Tense (T) state (deoxyHb). While these agents had var-
ied effects on Hb oxygen affinity and differing pharmaceuti-
cal properties (Fitzharris et al, 1985; Rolan et al, 1995; Kato
et al, 2013), they demonstrated that increasing HbS oxygen
affinity
can
inhibit
RBC
sickling
in
vitro
and
reduce
haemolysis in vivo in SCD patients without any evidence of
compromised oxygen delivery to tissues at the predicted
efficacious doses. To achieve the required combination of
potency and favourable pharmacokinetic (PK) properties for
long-term disease modification, we developed a novel, orally
bioavailable small molecule, GBT440, which binds specifi-
cally to Hb, has a ~150:1 RBC:plasma partition in various
animal species, increases Hb oxygen affinity and stabilizes
the oxyHb state. GTB440 binds covalently and reversibly via
a Schiff-base to the N-terminal valine of one of the haemo-
globin a chains and allosterically modulates the Hb-O2
affinity. In addition, we report here that GBT440 delays
in vitro HbS polymerization, prevents in vitro sickling of
RBCs and has an excellent PK profile. Moreover, in a mur-
ine model of sickle cell disease (Wu et al, 2006), GBT440
prevents ex vivo sickling of RBCs, reduces reticulocyte
counts and prolongs RBC half-life. Based on its favourable
properties, GBT440 has the potential to be a beneficial ther-
apeutic agent for the treatment of SCD.
Materials and methods
Chemicals
All chemicals were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich Company
Ltd. (St Louis, MO, USA) unless otherwise specified.
GBT440: (2-hydroxy-6 ((2-(1-isopropyl-1H-pyrazol-5-yl)
pyridin-3-yl) methoxy) benzaldehyde).
Tucaresol:
((4-(2-formyl-3-hydroxyphenoxymethyl)
ben-
zoic acid), also called BWA589C and 589C80.
BW12C: (5-(2-formyl-3-hydroxyphenoxy) pentanoic acid),
also called valeresol and 12C79.
GBT440, tucaresol and BW12C were synthesized at Global
Blood Therapeutics Inc. (South San Francisco, CA, USA).
Haemoglobin purification
HbS, HbA and HbF were purified from sickled (SS) or
healthy (AA) RBCs as well as from cord blood lysates by gel
filtration and DE-52 anion exchange chromatography (Gold-
berg et al, 1977). Samples of the eluted fractions were run on
a Tris-glycine 12% acrylamide native gel where they were
separated according to their isoelectric point (pI), allowing
their identification.
Crystal structure of GBT440-COHbS complex
HbS was diluted to 12 mg/ml in 20 mmol/l HEPES buffer, pH
7�4 and saturated by carbon monoxide (CO) gas. Carbon-
monoxyHbS (COHbS) was crystallized as described previously
(Patskovska et al, 2005) with some modifications. A protein
solution was mixed with a 2�5-fold molar excess of GBT440
and incubated at 25°C for 30 min prior to adding an equal
volume of the crystallization buffer containing 0�1 mol/l
HEPES pH 7�4, 40 mmol/l NaCl and 25% PEG 4000. Diffract-
ing crystals grew within 3–5 d using the sitting drop vapour
diffusion method at 20°C. Crystals were cryoprotected by add-
ing glycerol [20% (v/v) final concentration] to the crystalliza-
tion buffer before flash-freezing in liquid nitrogen. X-ray
diffraction data collection was carried out at beamline X29A at
the National Synchrotron Light Source (NSLS-I) using a wave-
length of 1�1�
A. COHbS was co-crystallized with GBT440 in the
P212121 space group with a single protein tetramer per asym-
metric unit. Data reduction was carried out using HKL2000
(Otwinowski & Minor, 1997). The structure was solved by
molecular replacement using coordinates of the Protein Data
Bank (PDB) entry 1NEJ (Patskovska et al, 2005). All models
were built using COOT39 and further refinement was carried
out with REFMAC5 (Vagin et al, 2004). The structure was
refined to resolution of 1�8�
A and deposited to the Protein
Data Bank (PDB ID 5E83; http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/search/
structidSearch.do?structureId=5E83).
Blood source
SCD blood was obtained from homozygous sickle cell
patients through the Children’s Hospital Oakland Research
Institute [CHRCO, Oakland, CA, USA (Institutional Review
Board [IRB] 2013-006)] and from the University of North
Carolina [UNC, Chapel Hill, NC, USA (IRB 88-034)]. Blood
from healthy donors was obtained from the Stanford Blood
Center (Stanford, CA, USA) and umbilical cord blood was
obtained from Conversant Bio, Inc. (Huntsville, AL, USA).
The anti-coagulant was 3�2% sodium citrate, except for
apheresis bags, which used acid-citrate-dextrose.
Oxygen equilibrium curves
Oxygen equilibrium curves (OECs) were collected using a
TCS Hemox Analyser (Guarnone et al, 1995) (TCS Scientific
Company, New Hope, PA, USA) to measure changes in the
binding affinity of O2 to Hb. Haemoglobin (25 lmol/l) was
incubated for 45 min at 37°C with various concentrations of
GBT440 in TES (2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)pro-
pan-2-yl]amino]ethanesulfonic
acid)/saline
buffer
(Duarte
D. Oksenberg et al
2
ª 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd, British Journal of Haematology
 et al, 2010) (pH 7�4 at 25°C). Whole blood (20% haemat-
ocrit [Hct]) from SCD patients was incubated for 1 h at
37°C with various concentrations of the indicated com-
pounds and diluted 50-fold into TES/saline buffer prior to
measurements. Ex vivo whole blood samples from GBT440-
dosed animals were collected in sodium citrate or hep-
arinized tubes and diluted 50- to 100-fold into TES/saline
buffer. Purified protein and whole blood samples were then
oxygenated with compressed air within the Hemox Analyser
and the OECs were collected during deoxygenation as previ-
ously described (Guarnone et al, 1995). p20 and p50 (partial
pressure of O2 at which Hb is 20% or 50% saturated with
O2) values were obtained using a non-linear regression analy-
sis. Percentage change in p50 [Δp50 (%)] was calculated as
follows:
DP50
(%) = [(p50
of
control)–p50
with
com-
pound)/p50 control] 9 100.
Oxygen dissociation assay
The Oxygen Dissociation Assay (ODA) is a novel assay that
uses spectral signatures of Hb (Soret bands: 400–450 nm
and Q bands: 500–600 nm) to measure the level of oxy-
genated HbS (oxyHbS) during deoxygenation. Purified HbS
(3 lmol/l in 50 mmol/l KH2PO4, 30 lmol/l 2,3-diphospho-
glycerate [DPG], pH = 7�4) was incubated for 1 h under
ambient air at 37°C in the presence or absence of various
concentrations of GBT440 in 96-well plates. Samples were
deoxygenated with N2 for 2 h at 37°C in a plate reader
(SPECTROstar Nano, BMG Labtech, Inc., Cary, NC, USA).
Deoxygenation was achieved by blowing N2 over (but not
directly into) the samples. As the buffer and haemoglobin
equilibrated during deoxygenation, spectral measurements
(350 nm to 700 nm) were obtained every 6 min to deter-
mine the oxyHbS level over time. Data analysis was per-
formed using linear regression of the data obtained at
wavelengths ranging from 380 to 700 nm and results were
expressed as %oxyHb.
Polymerization assay
The effect of GBT440 on HbS polymerization was evaluated
in an adapted version of previously described in vitro assays
(Adachi & Asakura, 1982; He & Russell, 2002). Given that
GBT440’s mechanism of action is through increased oxyHb
under hypoxic conditions, slow and controlled deoxygenation
was necessary to allow evaluation of the effect of GBT440 on
HbS polymerization. In addition, due to the potential reac-
tivity of chemical deoxygenates (such as Sodium Dithionite)
with aldehydes, deoxygenation of HbS was achieved in a
hypoxic chamber containing 0�5% O2 and 99�5% N2. To
modify
HbS
with
GBT440,
purified
HbS
in
1�8 mol/l
KH2PO4 was incubated with a 2-fold molar excess of
GBT440 for 1 h at 25°C. After incubation, GBT440-modified
HbS (GBT440-HbS) was sequentially exchanged through four
PD SpinTrap G-25 desalting columns (GE Healthcare Life
Sciences Inc., Pittsburgh, PA, USA) previously equilibrated
with 1�8 mol/l KH2PO4, in order to remove unbound
GBT440. Complete removal of unbound GBT440 was verified
using liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC/MS).
GBT440-HbS was mixed with unmodified HbS in various
ratios and the Hb mixture (50 lmol/l) was deoxygenated at
4°C in a hypoxic chamber (0�5% O2) for 90 min. Next, poly-
merization of the deoxygenated Hb mixture (50 ll) was ini-
tiated by increasing the temperature of the reaction to 37°C
in the hypoxic chamber. Polymerization was measured by
the increase in absorbance at 700 nm for 50 min. A plot of
the optical density (at 700 nm) on the y-axis against time on
the x-axis was generated. The delay time was determined as
the time point at which the derivative (or slope) of the poly-
merization curve was equal to +0�02 (a positive slope signify-
ing the point of inflection from the delay phase to the
polymer growth phase of the curve).
In vitro and ex vivo anti-sickling measurements
Sickling of sickle RBCs (SS RBCs) was evaluated using a TCS
Hemox
Analyser
and
morphometric
measurements.
For
in vitro sickling experiments, whole blood (20% Hct) from
SCD patients who had been transfusion free for 2 to
3 months (HbS > 70%) was incubated with various concen-
trations of GBT440 for 1 h at 37°C, diluted 100-fold in TES/
saline buffer and deoxygenated in a Hemox Analyser. For
ex vivo sickling experiments, whole blood samples from vehi-
cle-treated or GBT440-treated mice were diluted 100-fold in
TES/saline buffer and deoxygenated in a Hemox Analyser. SS
RBCs (15 ll) were harvested during deoxygenation at various
O2 tensions and immediately fixed in a deoxygenated solu-
tion of 2% glutaraldehyde/phosphate buffered saline (PBS)
(1 ml) prior to morphological quantitative analysis. For
in vitro sickling experiments, brightfield images (409 magni-
fication) of sickled cells suspended in PBS were quantitated
based on circularity using the CellVigene software (Vigene-
Tech Inc., Carlisle, MA, USA). Bright field images were
acquired at 25°C on a Nikon Eclipse TS100 microscope
(Nikon, Melville, NY, USA) fitted with an Infinity Lite cam-
era using the Infinity Capture software (both Lumenera
Corp., Nepean, ON, Canada). For ex vivo sickling experi-
ments, sickled cells were analysed with an imaging flow
cytometer (AMNIS ImageStream X MkII; EMD Millipore,
Billerica, MA. USA). Doublets and cells that were not in
focus were excluded and an algorithm was applied to quan-
tify the percentage of sickled cells. The morphometric param-
eters of shape ratio/area against circularity provided the
optimal quantification of sickled cells when applied to bright
field images.

 bred by selective mating at Emory University. The result-
ing sickle mice express exclusively the human globins [a, c
and bS] (Wu et al, 2006). HbAA Townes mice (AA mice)
were created by replacing the c-bS with a human c-bA
chain. All animal experiments were approved by the Insti-
tutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at
Emory
University.
GBT440
[100–150 mg/kg
in
0�5%
methylcellulose/0�5% Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate (SDS)] was
administered twice a day by oral gavage for 9–12 d. Blood
samples (5–50 ll) for OEC determinations, sickling mea-
surements, and GBT440 concentration were collected 4 h
following the last dose of the chronic regimen. Blood sam-
ples for reticulocyte counts were taken pre-dose and at
several intervals during the chronic dosing period. Blood
samples for RBC half-life determination were taken every
day, following biotinylation on day 5, until the end of the
dosing experiment.
RBC half-life and reticulocyte count
RBC half-life was determined by a pulse biotinylation experi-
ment (Kean et al, 2002). Fifty mg/kg N-hydroxysuccinimide
biotin (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA, USA), was injected
intravenously on day 5, producing a biotin pulse-label. Mice
were bled each day following biotinylation and the percent-
age of biotinylated RBCs was determined by flow cytometry
(FACS Canto II; BD Biosciences Inc., San Jose, CA, USA)
using fluorescently labelled streptavidin to identify biotiny-
lated cells and a fluorescent Ter-119 antibody to identify
RBCs. The clearance of the biotinylated RBCs from the
peripheral circulation was used to determine the half-life of
the RBC population. Reticulocyte counts were defined by
flow cytometry as the percentage of blood cells that were
Ter-119+, Thiazole-Orange+ (RNA-binding dye) and CD45-
(white blood cells) by flow cytometry.
Pharmacokinetics measurements
The PK profile of GBT440 was characterized in C57BL/6J
mice, Sprague–Dawley rats, Beagle dogs and Cynomolgus
monkeys following intravenous (IV: 70, 1�6, 1 and 1 mg/kg,
respectively) and oral (PO: 30, 7�2, 2�5 and 4�3 mg/kg,
respectively)
administration.
Blood
and
plasma
samples
were serially collected from each animal up to 72–96 h
post-dose and analysed for GBT440 concentration using
LC/MS. The analytical range was 100 to 100 000 ng/ml for
both plasma and blood samples. Blood and plasma concen-
trations of GBT440 were analysed by non-compartmental
analysis using Phoenix WinNonlin software (version 6�4;
Pharsight Inc., Cary, NC, USA) to obtain pharmacokinetic
parameters [half-life (T½), area under the curve (AUC),
maximum blood and plasma concentration (Cmax) and time
to reach Cmax (Tmax)]. Blood to plasma concentration ratio
was calculated from a ratio of AUC in blood divided by
AUC in plasma between 24 and 96 h.
Statistics
To
analyse
statistical
significance,
2-tailed
paired
and
unpaired Student’s t-test was used as appropriate. GRAPHPAD
PRISM 6 SOFTWARE (GraphPad Software Inc, La Jolla, CA,
USA) was used for all statistical analyses. P < 0�05 was con-
sidered significant.
Results
GBT440 binds to HbS with 1:1 stoichiometry
We designed a haemoglobin-modifying agent with improved
potency and specificity for Hb in relation to prior published
compounds (Beddell et al, 1984; Arya et al, 1996; Abdulma-
lik et al, 2005). GBT440 forms a reversible covalent bond
with the N-terminal valine of the a chain of HbS [Schiff
base, (Fig 1A)] that results in an allosteric modification of
Hb with a subsequent increase in Hb-O2 affinity. An X-Ray
structure of GBT440 bound to HbS demonstrates a 1:1 stoi-
chiometry (Fig 1B). GBT440 binds to the N-terminal valine
residue of one of the a globin chains and exhibits a hydrogen
bond to Ser 131 of the second alpha chain via the pyrazole
substituent. This interaction precludes binding of a second
GBT440 molecule binding via a Schiff base to the free
N-terminal valine of the remaining a chain (Fig 1C). These
interactions result in a single GBT440 molecule bound per
haemoglobin tetramer, a 1:1 stoichiometry that is in contrast
with the observed 2:1 stoichiometry of previously described
benchmark compounds, 5-HMF, INN 312 and BW12C (Wir-
eko et al, 1991; Abdulmalik et al, 2005, 2011). While the
observed 1:1 stoichiometry of GBT440 to HbS has not been
confirmed by an orthogonal biochemical method, we have
observed similar 1:1 stoichiometry with a number of struc-
turally related compounds that belong to this scaffold, sug-
gesting that this is a real phenomenon that is probably
linked to improved properties compared with earlier mole-
cules. The GBT440 binding site on HbS is distant from the
haem pockets and therefore does not directly prevent the
release of O2. Through one dimensional nuclear magnetic
resonance studies of GBT440 complexed to Hb (Patel et al,
2014) we observed allosteric shifts in Hb structure, including
changes to the dimer:dimer interface of Hb as well as
changes to the haem pocket. Thus, these biophysical studies
show that GBT440 acts upon the oxyHb/deoxyHb transition
via an allosteric mechanism.
GBT440 increases HbS affinity for O2
An increase in the Hb-O2 affinity is indicated by a left shift of
the OEC with subsequent decreases in p50. In the absence
of GBT440, purified HbS and whole blood have p50 values of
12�4 � 0�5 mm
Hg
(Fig 1D)
and
29�8 � 0�9 mm
Hg
(Fig 1E), respectively. GBT440 dose-dependently decreases the

 lmol/l, Fig 1D, inset) of purified HbS and whole blood from
SCD patients (EC50 = 415 � 15 lmol/l, Fig 1E, inset). As
GBT440 binds to the a chain of Hb, it similarly increases the
oxygen affinity of purified HbA and normal blood (Fig S1A,
B). Consistent with the 1:1 GBT440: Hb stoichiometry, we
observed an improved potency in whole blood compared to
previously characterized compounds (5HMF, tucaresol and
BW12C) that exhibit a 2:1 stoichiometry (Table I). The shape
of the OEC changes from sigmoidal to biphasic and to hyper-
bolic with increasing GBT440 concentrations (Fig 1E). Pre-
incubation of the whole blood with 300 and 600 lmol/l

 coexistence of Hb species with varying O2 affinities (Imai
et al, 2001). For example, at the 300 lmol/l GBT440 concen-
tration, we expect ~30% of the Hb to be in a high Hb-O2
affinity form given a Hb concentration of 1 mmol/l in blood
(20% Hct). As such, 70% of the Hb remains in a normal Hb-
O2 affinity form and participates in normal loading and
unloading of O2.
The ability of GBT440 to increase Hb-O2 affinity was fur-
ther confirmed in the ODA, where HbS pre-incubated with
GBT440 was deoxygenated for 2 h and the percentage of
oxyHb was quantitated. After 2 h, in the absence of GBT440,
oxyHb decreased from 100% to 24% (Fig 1F). However, at
equimolar concentrations of GBT440 and Hb (3 lmol/l),
83% of the Hb remained in the oxygenated state while at a
substoichiometric concentration of GBT440 (1 lmol/l), 48%
of the Hb remained in the oxygenated state (Fig 1G).
These data indicate that GBT440 delays O2 release in a con-
centration-dependent
manner
(EC50 = 1�2 � 0�03 lmol/l),
demonstrating that the compound stabilizes the oxyHb con-
formation (Fig 1G).
GBT440 delays HbS polymerization
In SCD, delay of HbS polymerization during transit of RBCs
through post-capillary venules supplying hypoxic tissues is
necessary for disease modification (Mozzarelli et al, 1987).
Given that oxyHb is a potent inhibitor of deoxyHbS poly-
merization, maintaining a proportion of oxyHbS within
RBCs may prevent RBC sickling during hypoxic conditions.
As GBT440-modified HbS (GBT440-HbS) can maintain an
oxyHb state under hypoxic conditions, we evaluated the
effect of GBT440 on in vitro HbS polymerization. Accord-
ingly, GBT440-HbS was mixed with unmodified HbS in vari-
ous ratios followed by deoxygenation and initiation of
polymerization. In separate control reactions, the natural
polymerization inhibitor, HbF was mixed in similar ratios
with unmodified HbS as GBT440-HbS. The delay time of
HbS alone was 9 min (Fig 2A,B), which is longer than previ-
ously reported in vitro delay times (~4–5 min) for a similar
concentration of HbS (He & Russell, 2002). This relative
increase in delay time of HbS alone may be due to
incomplete deoxygenation. Nonetheless, GBT440-HbS dose-
dependently delayed polymerization of unmodified HbS.
Moreover,
under
the
in
vitro
conditions
used
herein,
GBT440-HbS and HbF delayed HbS polymerization with
similar delay times (Fig 2A, B; Table II). For example,
20–30% HbF, a range observed to prevent the manifestations
of SCD in subjects with S/HPFH (Akinsheye et al, 2011),
delayed
HbS
polymerization
by
17�5–22 min
(Fig 2B,
Table II). Similar to HbF, 20–30% GBT440-HbS delayed
HbS
polymerization
by
18�5–22 min
(Fig 2A,
Table II).
Together, these data indicate that GBT440 is a potent inhibi-
tor of in vitro HbS polymerization and suggests that GBT440
may delay in vivo HbS polymerization.

However,
GBT440 dose-dependently reduced the number of sickled

to

during

deoxygenation
(Fig 3A). Moreover, anti-sickling activity was observed at
various oxygen tensions with a GBT440 concentration of
300 lmol/l, which is expected to modify ~30% of 1 mmol/l
Hb in blood (Fig 3A,B). For example, 30% modification of
Hb with 300 lmol/l GBT440 was sufficient to prevent
in vitro sickling at 40 mm Hg (Fig 3B–D). In contrast, the
number of sickled cells increased from 6% to 38% at
40 mm Hg (Fig 3A–D). Taken together, GBT440 demon-
strates potent anti-sickling activity in whole blood consis-
tent with its ability to inhibit in vitro HbS polymerization.
These
observations
further
support
the
hypothesis
that
GBT440 may inhibit sickling in vivo.
GBT440 reduces ex vivo sickling and prolongs RBCs
half-life in a murine model of SCD
The Townes knock-in sickle mice [SS mice (Wu et al, 2006)]
were used as a model for SCD. They mimic some of the
pathophysiology of SCD and represent a useful model to
assess anti-sickling compounds. In SS mice, the relatively
shorter half-life of GBT440 (9 h versus 16 h in control mice)
and high GBT440 clearance in blood (unpublished results),
suggested that a twice a day dosing would be necessary to
achieve target steady state concentrations. We therefore eval-
uated the activity and efficacy of GBT440 in this murine
model following repeated oral administration of the com-
pound (100 and 150 mg/kg) for 9–12 d. The SS mice
achieved variable GBT440 blood and plasma levels. Four of
14 treated mice achieved GBT440 blood concentrations of
520 � 20 lmol/l, corresponding to a calculated Hb occu-
pancy of 36 � 2%. (Table SI). The remaining mice achieved
GBT440 blood concentrations of 100 to 272 lmol/l, corre-
sponding to Hb occupancies of 11–19%. Hb occupancy rep-
resents the proportion of Hb bound by GBT440 and was
calculated as the ratio of the concentrations of GBT440 to
Hb in blood. The differences in blood GBT440 levels did not
correlate to the dosing regimen or days of treatment and
most likely reflect the disease severity in these animals, which
could potentially impinge on drug absorption. A lower RBC:-
plasma partition (37 � 10, Table SI) was observed in the SS
mice when compared to the partition (150:1) in various ani-
mal species (Table III). This was probably due to the shorter
RBC half-life (2�5 d) in this murine model. Moreover we
observed a high RBC:plasma partition ratio of 60–90:1 in
SCD and healthy subjects [Table IV, (Lehrer-Graiwer et al,
2015)] potentially reflecting longer RBC half-life in SCD
[~10 d, (McCurdy & Sherman, 1978)] when compared to SS
mice (~2�5 d).

 GBT440 increased Hb-O2 affinity and reduced ex vivo
sickling in whole blood of all dosed mice (Fig 4A–D). Inter-
estingly, we observed that in mice with low Hb occupancies
(11–19%), the left shift in the OECs was more apparent at
the p20 (p20 = 11�7 � 0�5 mm Hg and 18�4 � 0�3 mm Hg
in treated versus control mice, respectively) than at the p50
[(p50 = 28�8 � 0�3 mm Hg and 31�8 � 0�6 mm Hg in trea-
ted versus control mice, respectively, (Fig 4A). This observa-
tion indicates that at low GBT440 blood concentrations, the
p20 is a more sensitive indicator of GBT440 exposure than
the p50 due to the biphasic nature of the OECs. However, a
more substantial left shifted OEC (p50 = 21�7 � 1�3 mm Hg
and 31�8 � 0�6 mm Hg in treated versus control mice,
respectively)
and
decreased
RBC
sickling
(60%)
were
obtained in mice with high Hb occupancies [32–40%,
(Fig 4C,D and Table SI)]. In addition, we observed a high
correlation (r2 = 0�92) between the GBT440 blood concentra-
tions and the p20 or p50 values in all GBT440-treated mice
(Table SI and data not shown).
The half-life of RBCs in SS mice is shorter (~2�5 d) than
in control AA mice [16 d (Belcher et al, 2013) and our
unpublished results]. This difference most likely accounts for
the shorter half-life of GBT440 in SS (9 h), relative to AA
mice (13 h, unpublished results). SS mice also exhibit high
reticulocyte counts (>50%) due to ongoing RBC destruction
and haemolysis. Significantly, the four mice that achieved Hb
occupancy of 36 � 2%, exhibited prolongation of RBC half-
life, from 2�5 to 3�8 d (Fig 5A,B; P < 0�0001), and decreased
reticulocyte counts (Fig 5C,D; P = 0�003). Thus, GBT440’s
ability to extend RBC half-life and reduce reticulocyte counts
is a strong indication of its disease-modifying potential.
Taken together, these studies show that a target level of
Hb occupancy ≥11% was sufficient to increase Hb-O2 affinity
and reduce ex vivo sickling. However, prolongation of RBC
half-life and reduction of reticulocyte counts were generally
observed at a higher Hb occupancy of ~36% (32–40%) in
this SCD murine model. This murine model may require
higher Hb occupancy than might ultimately be needed in
humans due to the physiological differences of the murine
model – specifically a much shorter RBC half-life and much
more rapid RBC circulation time exposing RBCs to more
frequent sickling events in the venous circulation.
GBT440 exhibits favorable PK and pharmacodynamic
properties
Pharmacokinetics of GBT440 in C57Bl/6 mice, Sprague–
Dawley rats, Beagle dogs and Cynomolgus monkeys were
determined following IV and PO administration (Fig 6;
Table III). GBT440 quickly partitions into the RBC with a
RBC:plasma ratio of ~150:1. In blood, the volume of distri-
bution (Vss) was small (0�041–0�171 l/kg) and systemic clear-
ance
was
low
(0�016–0�113 ml/min/kg)
indicating
that
GBT440 was mostly bound to haemoglobin. Terminal elimi-
nation half-life (T1/2) of GBT440 was similar between whole
blood and plasma for each species and was long, ranging

 from 12 h in mouse blood to 66 h in dog blood. GBT440
was well absorbed and absolute oral bioavailability [F (%)]
ranged from 33% to 70% in four species. These data indicate
that GBT440 has excellent PK properties. Its oral absorption
and sustained blood exposure in mice, rats, dogs and mon-
keys predict the potential for once daily oral dosing in SCD
patients. In addition, its high preferential partition into RBCs
ensures that a relatively low amount of compound will be
present in plasma thus minimizing off target toxicities and
maximizing the therapeutic index. This was confirmed in the
ongoing Phase 1/2 clinical trial (NCT02285088, http://clini-
caltrials.gov/) where GBT440 showed dose proportional PK,
a terminal half-life of 1�5–3 d and high partitioning into
RBCs [RBC:plasma 60–90:1, Table IV, (Lehrer-Graiwer et al,
2015)].
This
is
in
contrast
with
the
partitioning
data
obtained with tucaresol (RBC:plasma 10–13:1) that may have
been responsible for its high concentration in plasma and the
subsequent adverse effects observed (Rolan et al, 1993, 1995).
Pharmacodynamic (PD) measurements were determined
ex vivo using whole blood and correlated with the GBT440
blood concentrations following IV or PO dosing in rats and
mice (Fig 6D). The increase of GBT440 concentrations in rat
and mice RBCs was accompanied by an observed increase in
Hb-O2 affinity as determined by the changes in p50 [Dp50
(%)]. There was a strong correlation (r2 = 0�8) between the
GBT440 RBC concentrations and the Hb-O2 affinity. In rats
dosed orally with 100 mg/kg GBT440, there was a time
dependent increase in both GBT440 RBC concentrations and
Dp50 (%) (Fig 6E). These results confirmed the GBT440
concentration-dependent increase in Hb-O2 affinity observed
in in vitro studies. Together, these studies support the
use of Hb-O2 affinity as a clinically relevant biomarker for
determining Hb modification following GBT440 administra-
tion and indicate that GBT440 has favourable PK and PD
properties.
Discussion
A major challenge in the design of Hb binding agents for the
treatment of SCD is to find an agent that will preferentially
partition to the RBC compartment, specifically bind to intra-
cellular Hb, and will not exhibit off target toxicities. Hydrox-
ycarbamide, the only drug approved for SCD, decreases
painful crises mainly by increasing HbF in a subset of RBCs
(Boyer et al, 1975), which leads to a variable clinical response
(Steinberg et al, 1997). A drug that inhibits HbS polymeriza-
tion in all RBCs has the potential to provide better efficacy.
Following significant medicinal chemistry efforts, we discov-
ered that GBT440 bound to HbS in a 1:1 stoichiometry
(Fig 1B) with improved potency in whole blood (Table I),
which may translate into reduced doses necessary to achieve
efficacy compared to its predecessors with a 2:1 stoichiome-
try (Wireko et al, 1991; Abdulmalik et al, 2005, 2011).
GBT440 allosterically modifies Hb, increases the proportion
of oxyHb and thereby delays HbS polymerization under
hypoxic conditions. While an increase in Hb-O2 affinity
could, in principle, decrease tissue oxygen delivery, GBT440-
modified Hb in the expected therapeutic range (10–30%)

 should be well tolerated. This hypothesis is supported by the
absence of evidence for tissue hypoxia in humans with natu-
rally occurring Hb mutations (Gonz�
alez Fern�
andez et al,
2009). These mutations are characterized by similar increases
in Hb-O2 affinity as measured with GBT440-modified Hb in
the expected therapeutic range. Furthermore, two important
mitigating factors in SCD patients should promote a net
increase in delivery of oxygen to peripheral tissues. First,
inhibition of HbS polymerization with GBT440 improves
deformability, decreases the viscosity of SCD blood (Patel
et al, 2014) and ultimately will increase blood flow in the
microcirculation, thus improving oxygen delivery. Second, by
decreasing haemolysis the resulting increase in Hb level
should improve oxygen carrying capacity and oxygen deliv-
ery. Moreover, the data from the SCD phase 1/2 trial with
GBT440 (Lehrer-Graiwer et al, 2015) shows a decrease in
erythropoietin and reticulocytes, further supporting that
GBT440 does not cause tissue hypoxia at the expected effica-
cious doses.
Our in vitro data indicates that GBT440-modified HbS
(10–30%) inhibits polymerization with similar potency as
HbF (Fig 2; Table II). Additionally, 30% HbS modification
with GBT440 (300 lmol/l) inhibits in vitro sickling during
exposure of RBCs to hypoxic conditions for 20 min (Fig 3A,
B). These results suggest that in SCD patients where RBCs
are transiently (<1 min) exposed to hypoxic conditions in
tissues, HbS modification with GBT440 at or below 30%
may be sufficient to achieve efficacy. Consistent with our
in vitro observations, in the murine SCD model GBT440
reduced ex vivo sickling in all dosed mice (Fig 4B,D) that
achieved Hb occupancies >11%. Furthermore, as a conse-
quence of reduced haemolysis, we observed a prolongation of
RBC half-life (Fig 5B) and a reduction in reticulocyte counts
(Fig 5D) in the subset of mice that achieved ~36% Hb occu-
pancies. Taken together, these studies present strong evidence
supporting the potential of GBT440 to reduce sickling,
extend the circulating half-life of RBCs and decrease exces-
sive erythropoiesis in SCD patients.
The PK profile of GBT440 in various animal species shows
a preferential partitioning in the RBC compartment in rela-
tion to plasma, which suggest a high affinity and specificity
for Hb. As previously stated, this dramatic partition was also
observed in human subjects [Table IV, (Lehrer-Graiwer et al,
2015)]. These data indicate a notable improvement in RBC:-
plasma partitioning compared to previously reported com-
pounds in human subjects (Kato et al, 2013; Rolan et al,
1995; 1993; Fitzharris et al, 1985). In addition, the oral
absorption, sustained blood exposure and high bioavailability
of GBT440 observed in animal studies predict the potential
for once daily oral dosing in SCD patients. Based on PK data
from four animal species, the PK profile of GBT440 in
humans was predicted using a simple allometric scaling

 technique. The predicted PK profile following an oral admin-
istration was highly concordant with actual data from healthy
subjects, which suggested that the disposition kinetics of
GBT440 in humans were consistent to that in animals. In the
ongoing Phase 1/2 clinical trial of GBT440, preliminary
results indicate that GBT440 was well tolerated in both
healthy subjects and SCD patients. Proof of concept was
demonstrated during the chronic treatment period with a
rapid decline in haemolytic parameters and improvement in
anaemia, which appear to correlate with drug exposure
(Lehrer-Graiwer et al, 2015).
In conclusion, our studies suggest that chronic modifica-
tion of HbS (10–30%) with GBT440 in SCD patients is
expected to deliver the clinical benefits of inhibiting HbS
polymerization and reducing RBC sickling while maintaining
oxygen delivery to peripheral tissues in SCD patients.
