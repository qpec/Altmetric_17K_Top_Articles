Introduction
Balance studies (1–4) and direct 23Na MRI measurements (5–10) 
suggest that humans store significant amounts of Na+ in their 
bodies, without increasing body fluid content or body weight. We 
recently reported ultra-long-term balance studies in 10 healthy 
young men simulating a flight to Mars (11, 12). We found that Na+ 
was rhythmically stored and released with about-weekly (cir-
caseptan) and circa-monthly (circalunar) periodicity. Rhythmi-
cal release of stored body Na+ was independent of salt intake and 
occurred when the subjects’ aldosterone excretory levels were low 
and glucocorticoid levels were high (11). Contrariwise, rhythmical 
body Na+ storage occurred when aldosterone excretory levels were 
high and glucocorticoid levels were low. Contrary to the traditional 
view (13–15), these rhythmical body Na+ changes occurred without 
parallel body weight changes, suggesting that the body maintains 
constant water content, while body Na+ content is variable. Earli-
er 28-day water balance studies in humans showed about-weekly 
rhythmical changes in urine excretion (16). These findings led us 
to reinvestigate long-term control of Na+ and water balance, as well 
as long-term Na+ balance in relation to water balance in humans.
In humans, a high dietary salt intake is assumed to increase 
fluid intake (15, 17). As a result, health authorities have suggested 
that a salt-driven increase in soft-drink consumption could con-
tribute to the obesity epidemic (18). However, much of the data 
are based on epidemiological surveys rather than direct experi-
ments (19, 20). In addition, some investigators have operated on 
the assumption that urine volume invariably reflects fluid intake 
 BACKGROUND. The idea that increasing salt intake increases drinking and urine volume is widely accepted. We tested  
the hypothesis that an increase in salt intake of 6 g/d would change fluid balance in men living under ultra-long-term 
controlled conditions.
METHODS. Over the course of 2 separate space flight simulation studies of 105 and 205 days’ duration, we exposed 10 healthy 
men to 3 salt intake levels (12, 9, or 6 g/d). All other nutrients were maintained constant. We studied the effect of salt-driven 
changes in mineralocorticoid and glucocorticoid urinary excretion on day-to-day osmolyte and water balance.
RESULTS. A 6-g/d increase in salt intake increased urine osmolyte excretion, but reduced free-water clearance, indicating 
endogenous free water accrual by urine concentration. The resulting endogenous water surplus reduced fluid intake at 
the 12-g/d salt intake level. Across all 3 levels of salt intake, half-weekly and weekly rhythmical mineralocorticoid release 
promoted free water reabsorption via the renal concentration mechanism. Mineralocorticoid-coupled increases in free water 
reabsorption were counterbalanced by rhythmical glucocorticoid release, with excretion of endogenous osmolyte and water 
surplus by relative urine dilution. A 6-g/d increase in salt intake decreased the level of rhythmical mineralocorticoid release 
and elevated rhythmical glucocorticoid release. The projected effect of salt-driven hormone rhythm modulation corresponded 
well with the measured decrease in water intake and an increase in urine volume with surplus osmolyte excretion.
CONCLUSION. Humans regulate osmolyte and water balance by rhythmical mineralocorticoid and glucocorticoid release, 
endogenous accrual of surplus body water, and precise surplus excretion.

urine volume in all subjects. The rhythmical nature of urinary Na+ 
excretion led to a lagged elimination of dietary salt, resulting in 
periodically low and high levels of salt excretion at each dietary 
salt intake phase, which may have masked the diuretic effect of 
elevated salt intake. We therefore additionally classified UNaV val-
ues into 3 tertiles of low, medium, and high UNaV levels to test for 
the effect of renal Na+ elimination on water balance. We found that 
higher salt intake reproducibly reduced water intake (Figure 1B). 
Mixed linear model analysis showed that water intake was 293 ± 
27 ml/d higher during the 6-g/d salt intake phase than during the 
12-g/d salt intake phase (Figure 1C). Water intake in the lowest 
(first) tertile of UNaV was 237 ± 27 ml/d higher than in the highest 
(third) tertile of UNaV (Figure 1C). A 6-g/d increase in salt intake 
did not significantly increase the urine volume (Figure 1, D and 
E). In contrast, urine volume in the lowest (first) tertile of UNaV 
was 316 ± 24 ml/d lower than in the highest (third) tertile of UNaV 
(Figure 1E). We interpret this finding as showing that an increase in 
urinary salt excretion induced some diuresis. This salt-osmolyte– 
driven diuretic response was often prevented at the 12-g/d salt 
intake level. Finally, we confirmed the accuracy of our long-term 
Na+ balance approach. We found the expected increase of approx-
imately 50 mmol/d in UNaV per salt phase when salt intake was 
increased by 3 g/d (Figure 1, F and G).
Urine osmolyte excretion induces osmolyte-free water generation 
in the kidneys. The renal concentration process is characterized by 
osmolyte excretion with parallel renal water reabsorption, result-
ing in a negative clearance of osmolyte-free water. We therefore 
next tested the hypothesis that the salt-driven increase in urine 
behavior (17, 21). While an experimental increase in salt intake ele-
vates fluid intake in various animal species (22–28), clinical stud-
ies have shown that varying salt intake in the range of 0.6 g/d to 
 
24 g/d may not change fluid intake or urine volume in humans (29). 
We therefore reinvestigated the relationship between osmolyte 
and water balance in ultra-long-term experiments.
Results
Infradian biological variability in long-term salt and water homeosta-
sis. In the 105-day Mars105 Study, we reduced the subjects’ aver-
age daily salt intake from 12 g/d (200 mmol/d sodium) to 9 g/d 
 
(150 mmol/d) and then to 6 g/d (100 mmol/d). In the 205-day 
Mars520  study, all subjects were additionally reexposed to the 
12-g/d salt intake regime after salt intake had been reduced from 
12 g/d to 6 g/d over the course of months. Long-term urinary Na+ 
excretion (UNaV), long-term urine volume, and long-term water 
intake (Figure 1A) are shown for a representative subject (see Sup-
plemental Figure 1 for data on each individual subject; supplemental 
material available online with this article; https:/
/doi.org/10.1172/
JCI88530DS1). As expected, the average daily urinary Na+ excretion 
rapidly adjusted to the new salt intake levels. The subject exhibited 
additional rhythmical day-to-day variability in UNaV at each dietary 
salt intake level. This highly variable UNaV was not paralleled by 
obvious changes in urine volume. Furthermore, and contrary to our 
initial hypothesis, low UNaV in response to a reduction in dietary 
salt intake was accompanied by increased fluid intake in the subject.
We next analyzed the effect of the prescribed dietary salt 
intake (dietary salt phase) and 24-hour UNaV on water intake and

FWC (Figure 2B). A 6-g/d increase in salt intake (correspond-
ing to ≈100 mmol/d Na+ and Cl–) decreased renal FWC by 540 ± 
 
27 ml/d (Figure 2C), while urine osmolyte excretion was increased 
by 201 ± 8 mmol/d (Figure 2, D and E). Increasing osmolyte excre-
tion and increasing Na+ intake reduced FWC (Figure 2, F and G) 
and reduced fluid intake (Figure 1, B and C). In contrast, increas-
ing fluid intake increased FWC (Figure 2H), indicating excretion 
of surplus consumed water by an intact urine dilution process.
Water intake was 32% higher than urine volume (Figure 1, B 
and D), indicating normal levels of insensible water loss in our 
subjects (25). On the assumption that 32% of the osmolyte-free 
water generated by the kidneys was similarly excreted by insen-
sible water loss, the salt-driven 540-ml/d reduction in renal 
osmolyte–free water excretion increased our subjects’ osmolyte-
free body water content by –540 ml/d × –1 × 0.68 = 367 ml/d 
(Figure 3A). This projected salt-driven increase in osmolyte-free 
body water by improved urine concentration (Figure 3B) can 
reduce thirst and corresponds well to the measured 293 ± 27 ml/d 
decrease in fluid intake in response to a 6-g/d increase in salt 
intake in our subjects. This state of affairs suggests that the phys-
iological response to daily-life increases in salt intake in humans 
relies on selective renal osmolyte elimination by urine concen-
tration, which allows maintenance of a body fluid balance in the 
absence of environmental water sources.
Dietary salt is excreted within the renal concentration mecha-
nism. Figure 4A shows how increasing UNaV led to a rise in urinary 
Na+ concentration in our representative subject (see Supplemental 
Figure 4 for data on each individual subject). We next questioned 
which alternative urinary osmolytes might be retained and accu-
mulated in the kidney to provide the antidiuretic driving force 
necessary to concentrate dietary salt in the urine. We observed an 
antidromic reduction in the urea and K+ concentration when Na+ 
was concentrated in the subject’s urine (Figure 4A). In all subjects, 
the excretion of dietary salt increased the urinary Na+ and accom-
panying anion concentration by 98 ± 3 mmol/l (Figure 4, B and C). 
The excretion of dietary salt by urinary concentration was paral-
leled by a 37 ± 4 mmol/l reduction in the urinary urea concentra-
tion (Figure 4, D and E), while the K+ concentration and accom-
panying anion concentration showed no reproducible changes 
(Figure 4, F and G). We interpret these findings as suggesting that 
urea accumulation in the renal interstitium provides the osmotic 
driving force necessary for antidiuretic water movement when 
dietary salt is concentrated in the urine.
Mineralocorticoid and glucocorticoid release in relation to water 
balance. A 6-g/d reduction in salt intake increased 24-hour urine 
aldosterone excretion (UAldoV) by 5.1 ± 0.2 μg/d (P < 0.001) and 
reduced 24-hour urine cortisone excretion (UCortisoneV) by 11.4 
± 1.0 μg/d (P < 0.001). However, as reported earlier (11), UAldoV 
and UCortisoneV showed additional rhythmical half-weekly and 
weekly patterns of change that were independent of salt intake. 
This spontaneous endogenous variability led us to stratify our data 
into tertiles of low, medium, or high UAldoV or UCortisoneV across 
each salt intake level (Table 1) and to study the effect of hormone 
level on water balance (Table 2), as well as on osmolyte-driven urine 
volume formation (Table 3).
The aldosterone-driven changes in body fluid balance 
occurred across all 3 levels of salt intake (Table 2). The sponta-
osmolyte excretion was coupled with enhanced free water reab-
sorption. We found that the sum of 2Na+ concentration (2-fold 
Na+ to account for unmeasured accompanying anions), 2K+ con-
centration (2-fold K+ to account for unmeasured accompanying 
anions), and urea concentration (U[2Na+2K+Urea]) amounted to 
almost 100% of the subjects’ urine solutes (Supplemental Fig-
ure 2). We show the relationship between the salt intake phase, 
osmolyte excretion, and free water clearance (FWC) in the same 
representative subject (Figure 2A). Any decrease or increase in 
the subject’s dietary salt intake resulted in a parallel decrease or 
increase in his urine osmolyte excretion. The salt intake–driven 
changes in urine osmolyte excretion, however, were coupled with 
antiparallel changes in the subject’s osmolyte-free water excre-
tion in the urine. This finding, which indicates that increasing 
osmolyte excretion was associated with renal water conservation, 
was reproducible in 10 of 10 study subjects (see Supplemental Fig-
ure 3 for data on each individual subject). Quantitative analysis 
showed that increasing the salt intake level gradually decreased

vation of urinary cortisone excretory levels by 33.8 ± 0.7 μg/d (P < 
0.001) was linked with increases in urine volumes of 627 ± 20 ml/d 
(P(cortisone) < 0.001), without quantifiable changes in fluid intake 
 
(P(cortisone) = 0.67; Figure 5B). However, the resulting negative renal 
fluid balance was not accompanied by changes in body weight 
 
(P(cortisone) = 0.25). This state of affairs suggests that the water surplus 
that was excreted when glucocorticoid levels were high had been 
generated endogenously. The renal water conservation mechanism 
did not contribute to endogenous water generation when glucocor-
ticoid levels were high. The rhythmical increase in UCortisoneV 
was associated with increased urinary 2Na+, 2K+, and urea excretion 
across all 3 levels of salt intake (Table 3), resulting in an increase of 
114.0 ± 8.5 mmol/d in the sum of 2Na+, 2K+, and urea osmolyte excre-
tion in the urine (P(cortisone) < 0.001). High rhythmical glucocorticoid 
levels were additionally linked with a reduction of 126 ± 7 mmol/l 
in the sum of 2[Na+], 2[K+], and [Urea] osmolyte concentrations 
(P(cortisone) < 0.001). Rhythmical glucocorticoid release was there-
fore linked to increased diuresis in the context of the urine dilution 
mechanism by increasing FWC (Table 2). The clinical readout was 
predominant osmolyte-free water excretion (see the supplemental 
calculations in the Supplemental Materials and Figure 5B).
Projected and measured salt-induced change in water balance. A 
6-g/d increase in salt intake reduced UAldoV excretion by 5.1 ± 0.2 
μg/d. The high salt intake thus reduced the level of spontaneously 
rhythmical 7.6 ± 0.2 μg/d UAldoV release by 73%, resulting in a 
projected –5.1/7.6 = –0.67-fold change in water intake, urine excre-
neously rhythmical 7.6 ± 0.2 μg/d UAldoV increase reduced urine 
volume by 219 ± 25 ml/d (P(aldosterone) < 0.001) and increased fluid 
intake by 95 ± 27 ml/d (P(aldosterone) < 0.01; Figure 5A). The result-
ing increase in water balance was coupled with a measurable 
body weight increase in the subjects (+0.41 ± 0.10 kg; P(aldosterone) 
< 0.001). We interpret these findings as indicating that the high 
mineralocorticoid levels induced body fluid retention.
We next studied the role of the rhythmical effect of aldosterone 
on the urinary concentrating mechanism. Across all levels of salt 
intake, the highly rhythmical UAldoV levels reduced 2UNaV by 
58.9 ± 6.1 mmol/d (P(aldosterone)< 0.001). However, this aldosterone- 
driven reduction in urine Na+ excretion did not significantly 
reduce the sum excretion of Na+, K+, and urea osmolytes in the 
urine (–16.0 ± 8.9 mmol/d, P = 0.07), because high aldosterone 
levels increased 2UKV by 22.6 ± 2.1 mmol/d (P(aldosterone)< 0.001) 
as well as urinary urea excretion by 20.7 ± 3.3 mmol/d (P(aldosterone) < 
0.001). High excretory aldosterone levels instead were associat-
ed with an increase in the urine concentration of 53 ± 7 mOsm/kg 
(P(aldosterone) < 0.001). The well-known antidiuretic effect of aldo-
sterone thus became clinically visible within the context of the 
urine concentration mechanism by reduced FWC (Table 2). This 
effect resulted in predominant osmolyte-free water reabsorption 
(see the supplemental calculations in the Supplemental Materials 
 
and Figure 5A).
The glucocorticoid-associated changes in body fluid balance 
occurred across all 3 levels of salt intake (Table 2). Rhythmical ele-

Discussion
We show that long-term water balance in humans is regulated by 
spontaneously rhythmical mineralocorticoid-coupled osmolyte-
free water accrual, which results in a body water surplus, and by 
spontaneously rhythmical glucocorticoid-coupled osmolyte-free 
water excretion for elimination of the water surplus. We have 
reported previously that rhythmical about–half weekly (circase-
miseptan) and about-weekly (circaseptan) aldosterone and corti-
sone release occurred independently of salt intake at each dietary 
salt intake level (11). We now show that this infradian rhythmical 
physiological regulatory pattern is linked to periodical generation 
of an endogenous water surplus. The process occurs via time- 
dependent mineralocorticoid release and promotion of antidiure-
sis, which alternates with time-dependent glucocorticoid release 
and promotion of diuresis and excretion of an endogenous water 
surplus. The obvious advantage of this endogenously driven gen-
eration and release of osmolyte-free water within the renal con-
centration or dilution mechanism is that long-term maintenance 
of body fluid homeostasis in humans may be less dependent on 
external water sources than is currently believed.
The physiological principle of water conservation within the 
renal concentration mechanism is that the excretion of surplus 
osmolytes is coupled with antidromic water conservation by reduc-
ing renal FWC. We show that increasing salt intake from 6 g/d to 
tion, water balance, and body weight (Supplemental Figure 5). In 
contrast, a 6-g/d increase in salt intake increased UCortisoneV 
excretion by 11.4 ± 1.0 μg/d. The high salt intake thus increased 
the level of spontaneously rhythmical 33.8 ± 0.7 μg/d UCortisoneV 
 
release by 38%, resulting in a projected 11.4/33.8 = 0.34-fold 
change in water intake, urine excretion, water balance, and body 
weight (Supplemental Figure 5).
Calculation of the combined effect of salt-driven mineralo-
corticoid suppression and glucocorticoid activation (Supplemen-
tal Figure 6) showed a projected 358-ml/d increase in urine vol-
ume formation in response to a 6-g/d increase in salt intake, which 
was associated with a projected –60 ml/d decrease in fluid intake 
(Figure 5C). These results suggest that increased glucocorticoid 
 
activity was associated with excretion of an endogenously gener-
ated water surplus at the high salt intake level. This projected salt- 
driven modulation of mineralocorticoid- and glucocorticoid- 
mediated adjustment of body water balance correspond-
ed well with the measured 316 ± 24 ml/d increase in urine 
volume and the 546 ± 34 ml/d reduction in the water bal-
ance gap between fluid intake and urine volume in the third 
tertile of UNaV excretion (Figure 5, C and D). The 24-hour 
negative water balance in the third tertile of UNaV excre-
tion was preceded by an increase in body weight of 882 ± 
 
99 g on the morning before the start of the 24-hour collection 
period (Figure 5D). This state of affairs suggests that increased 
urine volume formation and reduced fluid intake in the third 
tertile of UNaV excretion characterize the release of surplus salt

12 g/d led to endogenous osmolyte-free water accrual. The 6-g/d 
increase in salt intake decreased osmolyte-free water excretion by 
540 ± 27 ml/d and resulted in the successful generation of an endog-
enous osmolyte-free water surplus. This water accrual process was 
so effective that a body water surplus was available at the 12-g/d salt 
intake level and could be excreted and thereby increase the urine 
volume. The endogenous nature of this water surplus explains the 
seemingly counterintuitive finding that the excretion of a Na+ and 
Cl– osmolyte surplus of 201 ± 8 mmol/d at the 12-g/d salt intake lev-
el eventually reduced fluid intake, even though urine volume was 
increased. We conclude that the primary physiological response of 
the body to increased salt intake in our subjects was an antidromic 
management of osmolyte and water balance; osmolytes were excret-
ed and water was retained. Thus, the kidneys acted as a biological 
barrier designed for water conservation. This barrier functionally 
separates osmolytes from water to prevent dehydration while con-
ducting osmolyte balance. These renal changes occurred at a urine 
osmolality of approximately 500 to 600 mOsm/kg, which is not 
near the maximal values of more than 1,000 mOsm/kg for humans. 
This concentration maximum leaves a much wider range for endog-
enous water accrual before increased fluid intake in response to 
increased salt intake were to become necessary.
The idea is well accepted that increased salt intake induces 
thirst, thereby leading to increased fluid intake and secondary par-
allel elimination of the ingested excess salt and fluid in the urine 
(14, 15, 30) and supports arguments favoring strategies directed 
at reducing dietary salt intake in the population (18, 21). To test 
this hypothesis, we selected salt intake levels of 12 g/d, the value 
identified in the international worldwide INTERSALT study of 
approximately 9 g/d (31), as well as the value of 6 g/d or less rec-
ommended by guidelines committees (32). The fact that increas-
ing salt intake may not increase fluid intake or urine volume has 
been demonstrated earlier in shorter sodium and water balance 
studies. Luft et al. varied daily salt intake from 10 mmol/d to 200 
and 400 mmol/d for 7 days and found no influence of dietary salt 
intake levels on water intake or urine volume (29). Even increas-

ing salt intake to 660 mmol/d did not lead to detectable increases 
in urine volume in humans during completely controlled 4-week-
long metabolic ward experiments (4), albeit with a fixed fluid 
intake maintained at 40 ml/kg/d.
Studies of the relationship between dietary salt ingestion and 
changes in urine volume without parallel measurement of fluid 
intake show divergent results. He et al. found increases in urine 
volume with increasing salt intake in clinical studies of hyper-
tensive women and men under daily life conditions (17), which 
were similar to our results. In contrast, and in line with Luft’s 
earlier study (29), the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension 
(DASH) salt intake trial, in which UNaV was reduced from 159 ± 
5 mmol/d to 67 ± 4 mmol/d by dietary salt reduction, indicated 
that dietary salt was concentrated in the urine, with no changes in 
urine volume (33). We have shown earlier that excretion of dietary 
salt in our subjects was characterized by half-weekly and weekly 
rhythmically changing patterns (11). The resulting rhythmical Na+ 
storage and release reduced the predictive value of an accurate-
ly collected 24-hour urine sample to correctly estimate a 3-g/d 
difference in salt intake to only 50% (12). Therefore, quantifica-
tion of Na+ osmolyte excretion in the urine, and not of salt intake 
levels, was necessary to detect the effect of dietary salt intake on 
urine volume formation in our subjects . We are not convinced 
that epidemiological studies and information policy, which rely 
on associations among food intake, beverage consumption, and 
salt content in the urine to study a functional relationship among 
salt intake, soft drink consumption, and obesity in populations, 
rest on valid physiological and methodological assumptions (18, 
19, 21). The fact that a 6-g/d increase in salt intake led to surplus 
body water without increasing fluid intake has prompted us to pro-
pose an alternative view on the long-term control of body fluids in 
humans with increased osmolyte excretion. We present our inter-
pretation as 3 interconnected hypotheses.
Hypothesis 1: Increasing salt intake promotes accrual of endoge-
nous water. This hypothesis is based on 3 findings. First, the long-
term physiological pattern of increased Na+ (with anions), K+ (with 
anions), and urea excretion was coupled with decreased FWC in 10 
of 10 study subjects. This water conservation princi-
ple with increased osmolyte excretion occurred spon-
taneously at each of our 3 dietary salt intake levels and 
was more likely to occur at the 12-g/d salt intake level, 
when the dietary salt-induced Na+ and Cl– osmolyte 
surplus of 201 ± 8 mmol/d was released. Second, the 
resulting body water accrual pattern during states 
of surplus osmolyte excretion such as that occurring 
with increased dietary salt intake is apparently effi-
cient enough to generate an endogenous, fluid intake– 
independent water surplus, as demonstrated by 
a quantifiable increase in body weight despite 
decreased fluid intake. Third, all study subjects 
excreted the dietary Na+ within the urine concentra-
tion process. This physiological principle of dietary 
salt excretion has been demonstrated previously: 
excess dietary salt was concentrated in the urine in the 
DASH study (31), as well as in the clinical salt-loading 
study by Luft et al. (27). In addition, our data sug-
gest that the more negative FWC needed to concen-
trate salt osmolytes in the urine requires the accumulation of other 
osmolytes in the renal interstitium to provide the alternative osmot-
ic driving force necessary to reabsorb water and counterbalance the 
osmotic-diuretic effect of salt osmolyte excretion. We show that 
the concentration of dietary salt in the urine was characterized by a 
predominantly reduced urinary urea concentration. These findings 
suggest that, in states of high dietary salt excretion, humans accu-
mulate urea osmolytes in the renal medulla to support the renal 
concentration mechanism and thereby successfully reabsorb water. 
Similarly, as demonstrated earlier by McCance and Widdowson 
(26), urea-driven fluid retention may limit renal water loss during 
exercise-induced water loss from the skin. The idea that increased 
salt intake modulates such natriuretic-ureotelic regulation of body 
fluids suggests that a major regulatory pattern of dietary salt excre-
tion involves renal elimination of osmolytes, which is coupled with 
urea-driven, osmolyte-free fluid retention to prevent salt-driven 
osmotic diuresis and dehydration (Supplemental Figure 7).
Hypothesis 2: Dietary salt modulates endogenous infradian- 
rhythmical control of osmolyte and water accrual and release. This 
hypothesis is based on 3 findings. First, across all 3 salt intake 
levels and independent of salt intake, spontaneously rhythmical 
aldosterone release was linked to Na+ reabsorption and antidiure-
sis, favoring a body water surplus with a measurable increase in 
body weight, primarily by free water reabsorption. These effects 
occurred within the renal concentration mechanism. Second, 
across all 3 salt intake levels, and therefore not primarily depen-
dent on salt intake, spontaneously rhythmical glucocorticoid 
release was linked to the excretion of all 3 major osmolytes and 
their accompanying anions and was associated with urine forma-
tion by relative urine dilution. The linkage between increased glu-
cocorticoid excretion and osmolyte-free water excretion occurred 
in the absence of increased fluid intake, indicating excretion of 
a previously generated water surplus. Third, a 6-g/d increase in 
salt intake reduced the level of spontaneously rhythmical endog-
enous mineralocorticoid hormone release and increased the level 
of spontaneously rhythmical endogenous glucocorticoid hor-
mone release. We show that the projected combined effect of salt-

cally analyzed by mixed linear model and are expressed as the Δ change ± SEM. Details on 
statistical analysis for Figure 3 are provided in the Supplemental Materials (page 100). The 
projected insensible water loss was estimated from the measured difference between fluid 
intake and urine volume in all subjects and at all phases of salt intake.

rone excretion, but also increased cortisol and cortisone excretion 
in the urine (11). This finding is in line with the study by Kerstens 
et al. that examined the effect of dietary salt ingestion on gluco-
corticoid excretion in salt-resistant subjects under daily life condi-
tions (34). Thus, a 6-g/d increase in salt intake induces a catabolic 
hormone profile in humans. Second, we found that high glucocor-
ticoid levels occurred with increased Na+, K+, and urea osmolyte 
excretion. However, protein intake was constant during the study. 
Urea is generated from exogenous or endogenous protein sourc-
es. This process is energy intensive and utilizes 3 moles ATP per 
mole of generated urea osmolyte. The increased urea excretion at 
a constant protein intake level therefore suggests that the catabol-
ic hormone profile predisposed the subjects to increases in urea 
production with higher energy expenditure when their salt intake 
was elevated. Third, approximately 90% of the diuretic response 
observed with high glucocorticoid levels was osmolyte-free water 
excretion, which occurred in the absence of increased water intake 
and resulted in a negative renal water balance. Increased body 
weight in the morning preceded a negative water balance within 
the next 24 hours. Thus, a 24-hour water balance at high levels of 
driven suppression of rhythmical mineralocorticoid release and 
promotion of rhythmical glucocorticoid release predicts a nega-
tive renal fluid balance, with reduced fluid intake, increased urine 
volume, and reduced body weight. This projected hormone- 
driven effect on fluid balance corresponds well to the measured 
negative renal water balance in the third tertile of renal Na+ 
excretion. This observation suggests that long-term water bal-
ance critically relies on rhythmical mineralocorticoid and gluco-
corticoid hormone action. In contrast to the predicted combined 
hormone-driven effect, the relative dominance of the glucocor-
ticoid-associated osmolyte and water excretion pattern in the 
third tertile of UNaV excretion was characterized by a measured 
increase in body weight, and not by a reduction in body weight. 
We interpret this finding as indicating that high glucocorticoid lev-
els occur when increased osmolyte intake and increased endog-
enous water accrual have led to a surplus in body osmolyte and 
water content that requires excretion (Supplemental Figure 8).
Hypothesis 3: High salt intake induces glucocorticoid-driven meta-
bolic water production. This hypothesis is based on 3 findings. First, 
a 6-g/d increase in salt intake not only suppressed urinary aldoste-

(40%–65%), the average transepidermal water loss in 
resting adults is approximately 10 g/m2/h (23, 28, 35), 
corresponding to approximately 500 ml/d in our sub-
jects. If increased salt intake had promoted osmolyte-
free water conservation not only in the kidney barrier, 
but also simultaneously in the epithelial skin barrier, 
an unmeasured reduction in skin water loss could have 
significantly contributed to the body water surplus 
detected in our subjects. Similarly, we have no infor-
mation on differential osmolyte and water handling 
in the lungs and intestinal barrier. These sites, while 
possibly important, require additional experiments 
beyond the scope of the present study.
While a 6-g/d increase in salt intake increased glu-
cocorticoid levels and therefore induced a relatively 
catabolic hormone profile, we cannot provide direct 
or indirect measurements of metabolic water pro-
duction at the tissue level. In the absence of indirect 
calorimetric measurements, molecular glucocorticoid 
receptor–binding studies, and MRI-based body com-
position studies, we can only hypothesize that the salt- 
driven increase in glucocorticoid levels led to increased 
breakdown of cellular fuels and increased metabolic 
water production, thereby contributing to the body 
water surplus observed in our subjects. We addressed 
this limitation in additional animal experiments and 
showed that a high-salt diet can increase corticoste-
rone release and thereby induce a catabolic state, with 
increased fatty acid oxidation and exploitation of mus-
cle nitrogen stores for urea osmolyte generation.
The experimental design of our study did not 
allow us to investigate the role of vasopressin release. 
In response to small increases in plasma osmolality, 
vasopressin release occurs before thirst is triggered. 
This neuroendocrine hormone system could be an 
important contributor to the endogenous rhythmical 
free water accrual and its modulation by dietary salt we 
observed in our subjects (36–38).
Summary. In summary, our ultra-long-term balance stud-
ies suggest that humans maintain water balance by endogenous 
rhythmical accrual and excretion of body water. Rhythmical min-
eralocorticoid regulation promotes Na+ retention and osmolyte-
free water accrual by enhancing the water-economizing nature 
of the renal concentration mechanism (39, 40), resulting in 
increased body water. Contrariwise, rhythmical glucocorticoid 
release is associated with osmolyte excretion and inhibits the 
renal concentration mechanism in order to excrete surplus body 
water. This surplus had been accrued earlier, either by successful 
water conservation in the renal barrier, or by additional (unmea-
sured) water conservation in the extrarenal epithelial barriers, or, 
alternatively, by increasing the rate of (unmeasured) metabolic 
water generation. A 6-g/d increase in salt intake reduces rhythmi-
cal aldosterone and enhances rhythmical glucocorticoid action, 
increases endogenous osmolyte-free water accrual, and ultimate-
ly results in the excretion of surplus salt osmolytes, together with 
endogenously accrued surplus water. However, the accompany-
ing relative predominance of rhythmical glucocorticoid release 
glucocorticoid excretion occurred with excretion of a surplus of 
free water, which had not been accrued by drinking water. This 
free water surplus may have been acquired earlier as a result of suc-
cessful free water reabsorption. In addition, increased rhythmical 
glucocorticoid action may increase metabolic water production by 
promoting protein, fat, and sugar breakdown.
Limitations. We showed that a 6-g/d increase in salt intake leads 
to osmolyte excretion and renal water conservation in humans, 
resulting in endogenous generation of a water surplus that reduc-
es thirst and fluid intake. However, we cannot provide information 
as to what extent the changes in insensible water loss or metabolic 
water production contributed to the generation of the body water 
surplus. Normal adults usually ingest 1.5–2.5 liters of water per day; 
the corresponding urine volume is 1–2 liters per day, assuming the 
usual low rate of insensible losses via the skin, lungs, and intestines 
(25). The average water intake levels and urine excretion data from 
our study are in agreement with this textbook assumption (Fig-
ure 1). Most of this insensitive water loss occurs via the skin and 
lungs. At constant ambient room temperature (20°C) and humidity

salt intake in C was calculated from the data presented in A and B and the measured 
suppression of mineralocorticoid and increase in glucocorticoid levels by a 6-g/d increase in 
salt intake. Details on the supplemental calculations and statistical analyses pertaining to 
Figure 5 are provided in the Supplemental Materials (pages 22 and 148, respectively).

g/d; medium salt intake: 9 g/d; high salt intake: 12 g/d) on the follow-
ing: daily water intake and urine volume, with the result defined as the 
difference between measured fluid intake and urinary volume (water 
balance gap); urinary Na+, cortisone, and aldosterone excretion; urine 
Na+, K+, and urea concentration; and urine osmolality. We found that 
a reduction in salt intake from 12 g/d to 6 g/d affected our variables 
in a reversible fashion when salt intake was increased from 6 g/d to 
12 g/d during the reexposure phase of the Mars520 experiment (Sup-
plemental Table 4). Furthermore, the effects of a gradual reduction 
of initially high salt intake to low salt intake were comparable during 
the Mars105 and Mars520 studies (Supplemental Table 5). Recorded 
Na+ intake and measured Na+ excretion levels were approximately 10 
to 20 mmol/d higher in the Mars105 experiment than in the Mars520 
experiment. The 3 different salt intake levels resulted in the expect-
ed differences in average UNaV per salt phase, albeit with remarkable 
variability due to the previously reported day-to-day rhythmical vari-
ability in urine Na+ excretion (11, 12, 22). Therefore, we stratified our 
UNaV data into 3 tertiles —  low (first tertile), medium (second tertile), 
and high (third tertile) UNaV — to test the effect of urine Na+ excretion 
per UNaV tertile on our variables.
Effect of urine mineralocorticoid and glucocorticoid levels. Likewise, 
we stratified our 24-hour aldosterone and cortisone excretion data 
into 3 tertiles of low (first tertile), medium (second tertile), and high 
(third tertile) hormone levels. We then analyzed the changes in the 
variables per tertile for urine cortisone or aldosterone excretion. The 
metrics of the resulting tertiles are provided in Table 1.
Statistics. We first graphed the variables for each subject per unit 
of time. We next expressed the variables’ average ± SD per salt intake 
phase or per tertile of UNaV, urine cortisone excretion, or urine aldo-
sterone excretion. We then investigated the salt phase– or tertile- 
induced changes (Δ) in the variables by mixed linear model analysis 
and depicted the estimated changes in the dependent variables as the 
estimated Δ ± SEM. We found excellent agreement between the mea-
sured average ± SD difference and the estimated ± SEM change in the 
dependent variables. To facilitate data expression and interpretation, 
we primarily studied the effect of 6-g/d versus 12-g/d salt intake and 
the effect of first tertile versus third tertile changes in UNaV as well as 
in urine cortisone and urine aldosterone excretion on water balance in 
humans. A P value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically signif-
icant. SPSS software, version 21.0 (IBM) was used for statistical analy-
sis. Detailed statistical analyses for each Figure and Table are provided 
in the Supplemental Materials.
Study approval
The isolation study was conducted at the Institute for Biomedical Prob-
lems in Moscow and approved by the Russian National Committee on 
Bioethics of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Physiology Panel, proto-
col numbers 241 (105-day study) and 269 (520-day study). All subjects 
provided informed consent prior to their participation in the study.

suggests that the maintenance of water homeostasis in states of 
surplus salt excretion is intimately coupled with changes in body 
energy expenditure in humans. Thus, salt-driven changes in ener-
gy metabolism may link high salt intake with diabetes mellitus 
(41–43), osteoporosis (44–48), and increased cardiovascular and 
neurovascular disease risk (49–54), even in the absence of any 
salt-sensitive blood pressure responses.
Methods
Study subjects
In the Mars105 and Mars520 space flight simulation studies, 12 
healthy young male volunteers provided written informed consent 
following due approval to spend 105 and 520 days, respectively, in an 
enclosed habitat consisting of hermetically sealed interconnecting 
modules. The crews lived and worked like cosmonauts on the Inter-
national Space Station. Environmental factors were maintained con-
stant. Microgravity was not simulated. Anthropometric data on each 
participant are provided in Supplemental Table 1.
Diets and the ultra-long balance approach
Nutritional intervention took place during the complete Mars105 study 
and during the first 205 days of the simulated flight to Mars in the 
Mars520 study. Dietary salt intake was controlled throughout the study. 
Dietary salt reduction during the Mars105 study was performed step-
wise from 12 g/d to 9 g/d to 6 g/d salt. Given the longer duration of the 
Mars520 study, we could reexpose the subjects to 12 g/d salt after salt 
depletion to 6 g/day salt (Supplemental Table 2). Each salt intake level 
was maintained constant for at least 29 days. Calorie intake necessary 
to satisfy energy expenditure with a moderately active lifestyle was 
permitted, and all other nutrients in the diet were maintained constant 
throughout the study. In contrast to salt intake, the subjects had unre-
stricted access to fluids, which included tap water, tea, coffee, juice, and 
milk. Monitoring of beverage consumption during the Mars520 study 
showed that the salt intake level had no influence on the subjects’ bever-
age selection (Supplemental Table 3). The study subjects measured their 
fluid intake volumetrically and recorded each serving in their log books, 
which resulted in precise information on daily fluid intake. The subjects 
carefully collected 24-hour urine samples and measured their urine vol-
ume gravimetrically or volumetrically. Each subject was informed about 
the pitfalls of sodium and water balance studies and urine sampling in 4 
separate 1-hour training sessions prior to the experiment. The subjects 
collected all their urine for a 24-hour period and each day transferred 4 
aliquots of 10 ml, which were then frozen for later analysis. We defined 
inadequate caloric intake and lack of accuracy in daily sodium balance 
as dropout criteria. Accuracy was evaluated by individual average dai-
ly urinary sodium excretion as a percentage of the actual daily sodium 
intake. We excluded subjects from analysis when their weekly urinary 
sodium recovery was repeatedly less than 80% of sodium intake or 
when the subjects did not adhere to our daily menu plans. Only this 
strict focus on experimental accuracy allowed us to implement a long-
term balance approach. Because 2 subjects did not comply with these 
criteria, we had to exclude them from further analysis.
