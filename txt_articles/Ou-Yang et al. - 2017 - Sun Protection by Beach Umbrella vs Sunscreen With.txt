IMPORTANCE Sun-protective behavior affects skin cancer prevention. Shade works by
physically shielding skin from direct harmful UV rays; however, skin may still remain exposed
to reflected and indirect UV rays. There is no current standard metric to evaluate shade for its
effectiveness in sun protection, and there is insufficient clinical evidence that a beach
umbrella alone can provide adequate sun protection.
OBJECTIVE To directly measure sunburn protection offered by a standard beach umbrella
compared with that provided by sunscreen with a high sun protection factor under actual use
conditions.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A single-center, evaluator-blinded, randomized clinical
study was conducted from August 13 to 15, 2014, in Lake Lewisville, Texas (elevation, 159 m
above sea level), among 81 participants with Fitzpatrick skin types I (n = 1), II (n = 42), and III
(n = 38). Participants were randomly assigned to 2 groups: 1 using only a beach umbrella, and
the other using only sunscreen with a sun protection factor of 100. All participants remained
at a sunny beach for 3½ hours at midday. Clinical sunburn evaluation of each individual for all
exposed body sites was conducted 22 to 24 hours after sun exposure.
INTERVENTIONS The shade provided by a beach umbrella or protection provided by
sunscreen with a sun protection factor of 100.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Sunburn on all exposed body sites 22 to 24 hours after sun
exposure.
RESULTS Among the 81 participants (25 male and 56 female; mean [SD] age, 41 [16] years) for
all body sites evaluated (face, back of neck, upper chest, arms, and legs), the umbrella group
showed a statistically significant increase in clinical sunburn scores compared with baseline
and had higher postexposure global scores than the sunscreen group (0.75 vs 0.05; P < .001).
There was a total of 142 sunburn incidences in the umbrella group vs 17 in the sunscreen
group. Thirty-two of the 41 participants (78%) in the umbrella group showed erythema in 1 or
more sites vs 10 of the 40 participants (25%) in the sunscreen group (P < .001). Neither
umbrella nor sunscreen alone completely prevented sunburn.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE A beach umbrella alone may not provide sufficient protection
for extended UV exposure. It is important to educate the public that combining multiple sun
protection measures may be needed to achieve optimal protection.

S
eeking shade is widely practiced to avoid direct sun ex-
posure to exposed skin.1 Unlike UV-protective cloth-
ing, shade typically does not block all the angles through
which UV light can reach skin. Different types of shade vary
in their protectiveness owing to differences in materials, size,
andvariationsinenvironmentalUVconditions(eg,solarangle,
time of day, season, and location).2-8 Some widely used shad-
ing devices, such as beach umbrellas, may have high UV pro-
tection factor ratings but do not protect skin from UV rays
whose angles of approach are diffused by atmospheric par-
ticles or reflected from the ground. People often assume that
their skin is fully protected as long as they are under the shade
of an umbrella. On the other hand, there are few clinical stud-
ies that specifically evaluate the UV protectiveness of a beach
umbrella or directly compare it with protection provided by
sunscreen with a high sun protection factor (SPF).
Weconductedasingle-center,evaluator-blinded,random-
ized clinical study to compare the sunburn protection effects
of a beach umbrella vs a high-SPF sunscreen side by side in a
beach setting under actual use conditions.
Methods
The study was conducted from August 13 to 15, 2014, at Lake
Lewisville, Texas (altitude, 159 m above sea level). A commer-
cially available beach umbrella (JGR Copa LLC; round-
shaped, 203 cm diameter, and 190 cm high) was selected for
thestudybecausetheheightandsizearetypicalofwhatiscom-
monly used at the beach. Transmission of UV rays through the
umbrella material was measured with a spectrophotometer,
and no detectable transmittance was found across the entire
UV spectrum.
Sunscreen lotion with an SPF of 100 (Neutrogena Ultra
Sheer SPF 100+, Neutrogena Corp) was used. UV-A protec-
tion factor measured via the Japan Cosmetic Industry Asso-
ciation UV-A test method9 was more than 33. This sunscreen
was tested to be water resistant for 80 minutes per the 2011
US Food and Drug Administration monograph10 and was de-
termined to be photostable.
The full study protocol is available in the Supplement. The
study was approved by the IntegReview Institutional Review
Board (Austin, Texas), and written informed consent was ob-
tained. Participants with a history of skin conditions, includ-
ing phototoxic and photoallergic reactions, that could inter-
fere with the study were excluded. At baseline, 7 exposed skin
areas (face, upper chest, back of the neck, both arms, and both
legs) were clinically examined. Only participants with no pres-
ence of sunburn on any exposed areas were enrolled. A total
of 92 individuals were enrolled in the study. Participants were
randomly assigned to either the sunscreen or umbrella group
according to the predetermined randomization schedule. The
randomization number was assigned sequentially in ascend-
ing order in the order of enrollment into the study. Once a ran-
domization number has been assigned to a participant, it can-
not be reassigned to another participant.
Participants in the sunscreen group were given pre-
weighed tubes of sunscreen. They were instructed to apply the
product liberally to all exposed areas of skin 15 minutes be-
fore beach exposure and were instructed to reapply the sun-
screen at least every 2 hours or as needed following the direc-
tions on the label. Total amount of sunscreen used was
recorded. Participants were instructed to stay at the beach for
3½ hours between 10 AM and 2 PM, but they could leave or stay
under a shade for up to 30 minutes for cooling or rest. Sweat-
ing was not monitored, but participants were instructed to re-
apply sunscreen after sweating.
Participants in the umbrella group were instructed to stay
under the umbrella without wearing clothes that could block
theevaluatedareasduringthedurationofthestudy.Theywere
allowed to leave the umbrella for up to 30 minutes after cov-
ering up. Positioning under the umbrella was monitored and
adjusted as the solar angle changed to minimize any direct ex-
posure of UV rays to evaluated areas.
Participants could not engage in water activities and were
placed at least 33 m away from the water. Time away from the
beach was recorded. Sun exposure was avoided after the con-
clusion of the study until evaluation.
Intensities of UV rays during the study period (between 10
AM and 2 PM) were monitored. Total accumulated dose of UV
radiation was more than 15 minimal erythema doses under
temperatures of 24° to 32°C and humidity of 35% to 55%. UV
reflectance measurement from the sand revealed a ground al-
bedo of 7% to 9%.11
All participants were evaluated clinically for sunburn by
aclinicianwhowasblindedtotherandomization22to24hours
following sun exposure. For each exposed area, a score of 0
to 4 was given, where 0 indicates no sunburn; 1, possible sun-
burn, not clearly defined; 2, defined redness clearly caused by
UV rays; 3, severe sunburn with pronounced redness; and 4,
edema and/or blisters.

Key Points
Questions How well does typical shade from a beach umbrella
protect against sunburn and how does it compare with protection
provided by sunscreen with a high SPF?
Findings This single-center, randomized clinical study found that,
during 3½ hours of sun exposure, 78% of participants under shade
from a beach umbrella developed a sunburn vs 25% of participants
using sunscreen. Neither shade nor sunscreen alone completely
prevented sunburn.
Meaning Shade from a beach umbrella alone does not provide
sufficient protection for extended exposure to UV rays; indicating
a combination approach may be needed for optimal protection
from UV rays.

A global sunburn score for each participant was calcu-
lated by averaging 7 exposed sites. Preexposure and postex-
posure scores were compared using the Wilcoxon signed rank
test. Intergroup data were compared using the Wilcoxon rank
sum test. Sunscreen use and time absent from the beach were
analyzed based on tube weight and diaries, respectively. Sta-
tistical significance was set at P = .05 for both tests.
Results
Eighty-one participants (88%) completed the study (25 male
and 56 female), with 40 in the sunscreen group and 41 in the
umbrellagroup.ParticipantshadFitzpatrickskintypesI(n = 1),
II (n = 42), and III (n = 38). Eleven participants did not com-
pletethestudybecausetheydidnotattendallscheduledstudy
visits.
Individuals in the sunscreen group initially applied a mean
(SD) of 15.8 (8.6) g of sunscreen (range, 4.5-41.5 g) to exposed
skin sites, corresponding to a density of approximately 1 mg/
cm2 (representative of actual sunscreen use12,13) (Table 1). Par-
ticipants reapplied sunscreen a mean (SD) of 2.3 (1.1) times
(range, 0-4) and applied a mean (SD) total of 29.6 (16.6) g of
sunscreen (range, 9.1-72.9 g), or approximately 2 mg/cm2.
Twenty-eight individuals in the umbrella group left the beach
during the study (mean, 7 minutes) vs 30 participants in the
sunscreen group (mean, 11 minutes).
Both groups demonstrated a significant increase in global
sunburn scores from baseline (umbrella group, 0.75 vs 0;
P < .001; and sunscreen group, 0.05 vs 0; P = .002) (Table 2).
The total number of sunburned areas was 142 for the um-
brella group and 17 for the sunscreen group.
Participants in the umbrella group had a significant in-
crease in sunburn scores from baseline for all of the body sites
examined vs those in the sunscreen group, who had no sig-
nificant increase in sunburn scores vs baseline for any site ex-
cept the face (0.18 vs 0; P = .02) (Table 2). Global scores in-
creased in 32 participants in the umbrella group (78%)
compared with 10 individuals in the sunscreen group (25%).
Seventeen participants in the umbrella group had a sunburn
score of 2 or more (redness clearly caused by UV rays) on 1 or
more sites, while 2 individuals in the sunscreen group had a
sunburn score of 2 in the facial area after sun exposure.

There is currently no standard metric evaluating the UV
protectiveness of shade. One proposal for a shade protection
factor calculated the ratio of erythemally weighted UV rays
measured horizontally in full sun vs under shade.14 An ideal
shade protection factor would take into account material fac-
tors (UV absorption properties of the shade material and cov-
erage size), environmental factors (amount of diffused UV rays
and albedo of the ground surface), and human factors (posi-
tion and orientation under shade).5,14 Because multiple vari-
ables can significantly influence the effectiveness of shade, it
remains challenging to quantify how much actual protection
a specific shade device would provide in a given situation.
Beach umbrellas, as convenient shade structures that are
widely used in summer, are designed to block direct UV rays
but do not block scattered or diffused UV rays, which could be
significant at places such as a beach. Our study used an um-
brella of typical size (in terms of radius and height) with no
transmission of UV rays and monitored the participant’
s be-
haviorundertheumbrellathroughoutthestudytoensurethere
was no direct sun exposure. We found that a beach umbrella
reducestheamountofUVlightthatcanreachskin,buttheum-
brella alone may not provide sufficient protection for ex-
tended outdoor exposure. This finding points to the impor-
tance of educating the public how to properly select and use
shade to maximize protection from UV rays in actual practice.
It also suggests that additional sun protection measures (wear-
ing hats and clothing, applying sunscreens, and limiting out-
door exposure time) may also be needed while at the beach.
Limitations
This study has some limitations. Only 1 type of beach um-
brella was evaluated in our study. Other shade devices, such
asbuildingsorcanopieswithdifferentcoveragesizes,maypro-
vide different levels of protection but are not likely to be very
effective unless they are also designed to protect against a ma-
jority of the scattered and reflected UV rays.3-8 Also, partici-
pants in the umbrella group were monitored and reminded to
adjust their position to ensure optimal coverage in the study.
People who do not adjust their position under a beach um-
brella may not be as protected.
High-SPFsunscreenprovidedbetterprotectionagainstsun-
burn than the beach umbrella, but it did not completely pre-
vent sunburn under actual use conditions. This finding may be
especially true for the face, where sweating may be a factor and
less sunscreen is generally applied compared with other body
sites.2,15 A sunscreen with an SPF of 100 was used since indi-
viduals in the sunscreen group would not be able to use other
sun-avoidancemeasures.AdifferentsunscreenwithalowerSPF
may result in more sunburn than observed in this study.
Conclusions
This is the first clinical study, to our knowledge, to directly
evaluate the efficacy of protection against UV rays of a beach
umbrella and compare it with that of a high-SPF sunscreen in
a side-by-side trial. Umbrella shade alone may not provide suf-
ficient sun protection during extended exposure to UV rays.
Although the SPF 100 sunscreen was more efficacious than the
umbrella, neither method alone prevented sunburn com-
pletely under actual use conditions, highlighting the impor-
tance of using combinations of sun protection practices to op-
timize protection against UV rays.

NOTABLE NOTES
John Tyndall’s Effect on Dermatology
Patricia M. Richey, BS; Scott A. Norton, MD, MPH, MSc
Whendermatologistsseethemutedindigodiscolorationofdermalmela-
nosis or an old tattoo, they knowingly murmur sotto voce, “
Ah, witness
the Tyndall effect.”But can they explain it?
JohnTyndall(1820-1893)wasthefirsttoexplainwhycutaneoushem-
orrhagicormelanoticlesions,whichshouldappearred-brownorbrown-
black, respectively, instead appear blue-tinged. Tyndall observed that
this phenomenon (Figure) occurred only in nonhomogenous media, in
which irregularities cause short-wavelength visible light (ie, at the blue
end of the spectrum) to scatter, some reflecting back to the observer.
Long-wavelength visible light (at the red end of the spectrum) contin-
ues to pass through (and ultimately vanish within) the nonhomog-
enous medium.
This led to a curious experiment that supported the emerging hy-
pothesis of germ theory. Tyndall proved that the airborne particles re-
sponsible for scattering light include living organisms, now recognized
as bacteria. When he placed food in containers sealed with purified air
(ie, air so pure and homogenous that it did not produce a Tyndall ef-
fect), the food did not decompose. In contrast, food placed in contain-
erssealedwithnatural,particle-filled(“Tyndall-ogenic”)airsoonspoiled.
Therefore, he concluded, natural air is full of imperceptible particulate
matter,includinglivingorganisms,thatinterferewithandscattertheSun’
s
visible light.

day. In 1864, Tyndall and 8 others, including biologist T. H. Huxley,
philosopher Herbert Spencer, and botanist J. D. Hooker, formed the
“X-Club,”which was intended to direct the course of British science
and lobby for government largesse.
