Abstract
Objective. To investigate the influence of various
weather parameters on the risk of developing a low
back pain (LBP) episode.
Design. Case-crossover study.
Setting. Primary care clinics in Sydney, Australia.
Subjects. 981 participants with a new episode of
acute LBP.
Methods. Weather parameters were obtained from
the Australian Bureau of Meteorology. Odds ratios
(OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were
derived comparing two exposure variables in the
case window—(1) the average of the weather vari-
able for the day prior to pain onset and (2) the
change in the weather variable from 2 days prior to
1 day prior to pain onset—with exposures in two
control windows (1 week and 1 month before the
case window).
Results. The weather parameters of precipitation,
humidity, wind speed, wind gust, wind direction,
and air pressure were not associated with the onset
of acute LBP. For one of the four analyses, higher
temperature slightly increased the odds of pain
onset.
Conclusions. Common weather parameters that
had been previously linked to musculoskeletal pain,
such as precipitation, humidity, wind speed, wind
gust, wind direction, and air pressure, do not in-
crease the risk of onset for LBP.

Introduction
Low back pain (LBP) is an expensive [1], major global
health problem, with the majority of people experiencing
LBP at some point in their life. This makes it the most
prevalent musculoskeletal condition, affecting up to
33% of the world’s population at any given time [2]. The
causes of LBP are poorly understood, with a belief that
different causal mechanisms occur at different stages in
its development [3]. This poor understanding makes it
difficult to diagnose the pathanatomical cause of the
pain, leaving it often defined as non-specific LBP [4].
The perceived relationship between unfavorable weather
(e.g., cold wet days) or changes in the weather and
pain have been recorded since Roman times, with
Hippocrates noting that many illnesses are related to
changes in season [5]. Some people report that their
pain symptoms are affected by the weather [6]. It is also
believed that a variation in climate and weather is asso-
ciated with a worsening of symptoms for several medi-
cal conditions, such as depression [7], rheumatoid
arthritis [8], fibromyalgia [9], and LBP [10].

 Despite the common belief that the weather can affect
pain onset [11], few studies have investigated this asso-
ciation in relation to LBP. Existing studies have a few
key limitations: they do not use a quantitative design,
they have relied on participants’ subjective recall of
weather, and they have not blinded participants to the
study hypothesis. One recent study [12] avoided all
three of these limitations and concluded that many of
the weather parameters examined, including tempera-
ture, precipitation, humidity, air pressure, and wind di-
rection, had no link to the onset of LBP. Higher wind
speed (odds ratio [OR] 1.17, 95% confidence interval
[95% CI] 1.04 to 1.32, P ¼ 0.01 for an increase of
11 km/h), and wind gust speed (OR [95% CI] 1.14 [1.02
to 1.28], P ¼ 0.02 for an increase of 14 km/h) were the
two exceptions, in which a small increase in risk was
found, but these were deemed not clinically important
[12]. These findings challenged previously held beliefs
that adverse weather conditions increase the risk of de-
veloping LBP. Following publication of this study many
people took to social media to express their disagree-
ment with and criticism of the results [13,14]. The huge
response to this study and the disbelief among the gen-
eral population in its results provide a strong rationale to
replicate the study in a new group of patients to deter-
mine whether the findings generalize.
The aim of this study was to examine the association
between various weather parameters and risk of a new
episode of LBP.
Methods
Study Design
This study used data from the PACE trial [15], a
placebo-controlled
trial
that
evaluated
paracetamol
(acetaminophen)
for
the
treatment
of
acute
LBP.
Patients were recruited across 235 primary care centers
in Sydney from November 11, 2009 to March 5, 2013.
A case-crossover design was used to compare LBP on-
set with various weather parameters.
Ethics approval for the PACE trial was granted by the
University
of
Sydney
Human
Research
Ethics
Committee. The use of the de-identified PACE data was
approved by Macquarie University Human Research
Ethics Committee.
Participants
The inclusion criteria for the PACE trial were as follows:
a new episode of acute LBP between the 12th rib and
buttock crease, with or without leg pain, for less than 6
weeks’ duration, preceded by 1 month of no pain and
of at least moderate intensity as measured by an adap-
tation of item 7 of the Short Form 36 Health Survey
[15]. We included a subset of participants from the
PACE study who had reported that the onset of pain
was 7 days or less prior to their entry into PACE. This
decision was made as accurate recall of the date of
pain onset was important.
The exclusion criteria for the PACE trial were as follows:
suspected serious spinal pathology, use of regular rec-
ommended doses of analgesics, spinal surgery in the
preceding 6 months, use of psychotropic drugs for an
uncontrolled mental health condition, or pregnancy or
plans to become pregnant during the study period [15].
Patients were excluded from this study if their onset of
pain was greater than 7 days or if we were unable to
assign them to one of the three major Sydney weather
regions owing to missing information.
Study Variables
A case-crossover design was used to compare expo-
sure to weather parameters at the time of the partici-
pants’ pain onset (case window) with exposure at the
same time 1 week (7 days) and 1 month (28 days) prior
(defined as the first and second control windows, re-
spectively). The weather exposure variables used in the
analyses for the case window were (1) the average of
the weather variable for the day prior to pain onset and
(2) the change in the weather variable from 2 days prior
to 1 day prior to pain onset. We used a similar approach
for the 1 week and 1 month control windows.
Pain data: Information on the date participants first expe-
rienced pain was collected by trained interviewers over
the phone. Upon enrollment in PACE, participants were
asked to list the number of days since their pain onset.
Meteorological data: Meteorological data were obtained
from the Australian Bureau of Meteorology (www.bom.
gov.au/) for the entire study period from 11 Sydney
weather monitoring stations and then compiled into
three major regions. The information was then collected
from the station closest to where the patient resided,
according to postal codes. The weather parameters of
precipitation (mm/h), temperature (�C), relative humidity
(%), wind speed (km/h), wind gust (km/h), wind direction
(degrees true), and air pressure (hPa) were obtained.
Statistical Analysis
The characteristics of the study participants and distribu-
tion of weather parameters were analyzed based on
standard methods for stratified analyses. A pair-matched
analytic approach (conditional logistical regression) was
used to contrast exposures (meteorological variables) for
the case window with exposure to the control window
[16,17]. As we used two control windows and two expo-
sure variables to characterize each weather parameter,
the effect of the weather parameters on risk of LBP on-
set was calculated in four different ways: (1) case versus
first control window (7 days prior to case window) for the
daily average of that weather parameter, (2) case versus
first control window (7 days prior to case window) for the
24 h change in that weather parameter, (3) case versus
second control window (28 days prior to case window)

 for the daily average of that weather parameter, (4) case
versus second control window (28 days prior to case
window) for the 24 h change in that weather parameter.
The effect of each weather parameter was described us-
ing OR (95% CI). The analyses were performed using
STATA version 12, with all weather parameters treated
as continuous variables and the OR calculated for a one
standard deviation (SD) increase in the weather parame-
ter [18].
Results
Data on 981 individuals with acute LBP were included
in the analysis. Table 1 shows the characteristics of the
study participants. Participants included in the study
had a mean age (SD) of 44.3 (15.0) years, were slightly
more male (52.6%), and were mostly currently employed
(76.9%). The mean (SD) days since onset of pain were
3.4 (2.1), with a mean (SD) of 6.9 (15.2) for the number
of previous episodes and a mean (SD) of 6.5 (1.9) for
pain intensity.
Throughout the study period the mean (SD) and range
for the weather parameters were as follows: 1.3 mm
(3.4) of precipitation (ranging from 0 to 45.7), 17.2 �C
(4.9) of temperature (ranging from 5.4 to 32.8), 72.0%
(12.3) humidity (ranging from 18.8 to 100), 11.8 km/h
(7.4) wind speed (ranging from 1.5 to 48.1), 16.9 km/h
(9.0) wind gust (ranging from 2.8 to 64.9), 167.2 de-
grees true (56.7) wind direction (ranging from 25.4 to
334.6) and 1017.6 hPa (6.6) of air pressure (ranging from
995.7 to 1,037.6) (Table 2).The descriptive data for the
meteorological parameters are presented in Table 2.
The estimates of the weather parameters from the con-
ditional logistic regression model are listed in Table 3.

Back Pain? Do Not Blame the Weather

 From the 28 analyses performed, only one of the
weather parameters provided a marginally significant as-
sociation with the onset of LBP; higher temperature (OR
[95% CI], 1.20 [1.01 to 1.42], P ¼ 0.03 for an increase
of 5 �C) increased the odds of pain onset.
Discussion
Statement of Principal Finding
This study evaluated the effect of weather on the risk of
onset of LBP. Contrary to popular belief, the weather
parameters of precipitation, air pressure, wind direction,
wind speed, wind gust, and humidity were not associ-
ated with the onset of acute LBP. This finding was con-
sistent whether we looked at weather on a single day or
changes in the weather over time or varied the control
window from 1 week prior or 1 month prior to the case
window. Higher temperature signaled a slight increase
in the risk of back pain that was marginally statistically
significant for one of four analyses. If we had adjusted
the P value for multiple comparisons, this P value would
not have been statistically significant.
Strengths and Weaknesses
A major strength of this study was that data for weather
and pain were collected independently of each other,
and because the study was conceived after the data
had been collected, the data were collected blind to the
study hypotheses. We also used objective weather data
from the Bureau of Meteorology. The case-crossover
design controls for stable within-subject characteristics,
as the person acts as his or her own control, which
helps control for confounding [19]. Our study results
were robust and uninfluenced by the use of two expo-
sure variables for the case window or the sensitivity
analyses using a second control window, apart from
temperature, which was marginally significant for only
one of the four analyses.
The study has some limitations. Recall is a potential lim-
iting factor, given that some people may not accurately
recall their exact day of pain onset. For this reason, we
only included those patients with a pain onset of less
than 7 days to minimize time recall bias. The weather
data collected were based on each participant’s home
address, but it did not take into account whether they
spent the majority of their day away from home. In addi-
tion, it did not factor in whether people spent the major-
ity of their day inside, outside, or traveling, or whether
they were exposed to air conditioning, heaters, or other
external objects that could affect the weather they expe-
rienced. The temperate Sydney climate may be another
factor to take into account, considering the temperature
range is less than in many parts of the world. It is possi-
ble that results may differ in regions with more extreme
weather conditions. Lastly, we studied a specific patient
group, and our results may not generalize to those with
chronic LBP or other long-term musculoskeletal condi-
tions such as arthritis. We would encourage future re-
search investigating those patient groups.
Comparison with Other Studies
The results of this study confirm the result of our earlier
study, which found no influence of various weather con-
ditions on the risk of LBP [12] in a separate group of
participants. Similarly to the current study, that one was
a case-crossover design that investigated weather ex-
posures using various case and control windows in rela-
tion to pain onset. Both this study and our earlier study
found no association between these weather parame-
ters and the risk of onset of LBP. Each study indepen-
dently recruited patients with acute LBP presenting for
care. Besides our earlier study, there has been very little
research investigating the effect of weather and the on-
set of LBP. The few other studies aimed at investigating
this area were based on very weak designs, often only
surveying patients about their opinions on the effect of
weather.

 humidity, that are believed to be associated with mus-
culoskeletal pain do not have an effect on the risk of on-
set of a new episode of LBP. There are a number of
potential explanations for why people mistakenly believe
that their pain is triggered by adverse weather. Humans
are fallible and susceptible to so-called patternicity,
where they see patterns in meaningless noise [20], and
confirmation bias [21], where they preferentially recall
events that confirm their pre-existing views and ignore
or discount events that challenge that view. In an inter-
esting study, Redelmeier and Tversky [22] demonstrated
that rheumatoid arthritis patients tended to see patterns
in their symptoms and the weather, though none ex-
isted, and that when college students were presented
with graphical displays of arthritis pain and weather over
time, they also saw patterns where none existed. The
authors concluded that beliefs about pain and the
weather “may tell more about the workings of the mind
than of the body.”

 chronic LBP or other long-term pre-existing musculo-
skeletal conditions, such as arthritis. We would encour-
age future research investigating those patient groups.
The issue of where patients live and work also needs to
be addressed, along with certain characteristics and ex-
posures in their everyday lives, including time spent in-
doors or outdoors and exposure to air conditioning or
heaters. Furthermore, future investigations in regions
with more extreme climatic conditions than those in
Sydney are suggested.
Conclusion
In
conclusion,
this
study
demonstrates
that
many
weather parameters previously believed to influence
musculoskeletal pain do not increase the risk of an epi-
sode of LBP. Higher temperature provided a slight in-
crease in the risk of back pain for only one of the four
analyses
that
were
conducted,
and
although
this
reached statistical significance, the magnitude of the in-
crease was not clinically important.
