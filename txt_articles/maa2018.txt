n the aftermath of the mass shooting at a social 
services center in San Bernardino, California,  
in 2015, President Barack Obama suggested that 
the relationship between firearm ownership and 
gun injuries might be as strong as 
the connection between cigarette 
smoking and lung cancer. The full 
extent of the burden of firearm in-
juries is incompletely understood 
because of historical restrictions 
on federal funding for research on 
firearm violence by the Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention 
(CDC). But recent increases in the 
frequency and lethality of mass 
shootings in the United States — 
and the approximately 90 gun 
deaths that occur each day — 
argue for efforts to reframe the 
national debate about firearms as 
a public health issue.
The 5-year anniversary of the 
Newtown, Connecticut, school 
shooting arrived in the shadow of 
mass shootings in Las Vegas and 
Sutherland Springs, Texas, in 2017, 
and shootings in Parkland, Flori-
da, and Santa Fe, Texas, served as 
additional reminders of the risks 
for children attending school. As 
the United States came to under-
stand a different set of health 
hazards — those associated with 
cigarette smoking — and the bur-
den of smoking-related diseases 
on the health care system, a major 
step was the 1964 Surgeon Gener-
al’s report on smoking and health.1 
This publication was the first of 
several Surgeon General’s reports 
on tobacco control, and similar 
reports on AIDS, mental health, 
and substance use disorders have 
influenced national discussions. 
A powerful step now would be a 
Surgeon General’s report to fully 
characterize the complex problem 
of firearm injuries and violence in 
the United States and to sharpen 
efforts to identify new solutions by 
revealing how the country got to 
its current state.
Objective data on the history, 
epidemiology, health effects, and 
financial costs of firearm violence, 
as well as the factors that contrib-
ute to it, could inform this discus-
sion by conveying the full scope of 
the problem. The nearly 20,000 
gun suicides and estimated 760 
gun deaths related to domestic 
violence in the United States each 
year would be worthy areas of fo-
cus for such a report, given the 
programs already supported by the 
CDC and other federal agencies 
that are aimed at preventing sui-
cide and intimate-partner violence. 
A definitive statement could also 
summarize the overwhelming sci-
entific evidence that having a fire-
arm in the home increases the risk 
of suicide. The report could serve 
as an urgent call to action for 
professional medical organizations 
and federal authorities. Interna-

tional leaders could help by de-
scribing the changes in both gun 
laws and social norms that have 
reduced firearm violence in their 
countries.
A study of World Health Orga-
nization (WHO) mortality data 
found that Americans are 25 times 
more likely to be victims of a gun-
related murder and 8 times more 
likely to die by firearm suicide than 
people in other developed coun-
tries.2 Japan, on the other hand, 
has among the lowest per capita 
rates of firearm ownership and 
gun murders and has the highest 
life expectancy in the world, as 
ranked by the WHO in 2015. The 
U.S. health care system is often 
blamed for the country’s ranking 
as 31st worldwide in life expec-
tancy. But the complex and in-
completely understood problem of 
firearm violence cuts across legal, 
political, educational, and finan-
cial systems. The new Surgeon 
General’s report could begin to 
tease apart entangled issues in 
these systems. The consequence of 
such system failures is enormous: 
beyond the deaths caused by gun 
violence, survivors often have life-
long physical and psychological 
problems, including disability, de-
pression, and substance abuse.
The increasing burden from 
mass-casualty incidents on the 
country’s emergency departments, 
health care system, and law- 
enforcement agencies has high-
lighted the urgent need for action. 
After the mass shooting in Las 
Vegas, patient needs rapidly over-
whelmed the capacity of emergen-
cy responders and paramedics. 
Miscommunications led to pa-
tients being taken to the closest 
hospitals, rather than to the 
trauma hospitals that were best 
equipped to treat them. But a 
surge of nearly 600 gunshot vic-
tims — many transported by pri-
vate vehicles — is a nightmare 
that is nearly impossible for any 
institution or city to prepare for 
without the assistance of state or 
federal agencies. The coordinated 
and effective medical response to 
the November 2015 mass-casualty 
event in Paris can be partially at-
tributed to a master plan devel-
oped 20 years earlier but never 
activated until that day.3 In the 
United States, a joint federal and 
state collaboration spearheaded by 
the Department of Health and 
Human Services could coordinate 
countywide emergency responses 
to mass shootings. Strengthening 
the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, 
Firearms, and Explosives and po-
tentially dividing it into two sepa-
rate agencies could also help ad-
dress gun-related threats.
As we further elucidate the 
problem of firearm violence, new 
solutions may present themselves, 
including ones that involve the le-
gal system. The National Rifle As-
sociation and gun-rights advocates 
have used litigation (such as Dis-
trict of Columbia v. Heller) to strike 
down existing gun-control laws 
and protect what they see as their 
Second Amendment rights. The 
challenge for firearm-safety advo-
cates is to develop an equally ef-
fective legal strategy to protect 
public health. Wide variability in 
state laws related to firearm own-
ership complicates this mission. 
California implemented an assault-
weapons ban in 1989, and Gover-
nor Jerry Brown signed the first 
“gun violence restraining order” 
in 2014 to allow family members 
and law-enforcement officers to 
petition the court to disarm a per-
son who makes threats of firearm 
violence.4 The Surgeon General’s 
report could catalogue these and 
other legislative efforts and help 
standardize firearm laws through-
out the country.
The report might also stimu-
late new ways of thinking, shifts 
in societal norms, and develop-
ment of new social programs re-
lated to firearm safety. The person 
behind the Sutherland Springs 
shooting had served time in pris-
on for domestic violence and es-
caped from a mental health facil-
ity but was still able to acquire 
firearms. The Parkland shooting 
occurred despite repeated notifi-
cations to the Federal Bureau of 
Investigation and law enforcement 
about the threat posed by a stu-
dent who had stated his violent in-
tent on social media. Breakdowns 
in communication, straw purchas-
es (buying a gun for another per-
son who may be prohibited from 
purchasing one), the portrayal of 
gun violence in movies, limitations 
of background checks, lost and 
stolen firearms, and fragmented 
accountability in the chain of re-
porting of dangerous persons re-
flect larger societal challenges. A 
deeper understanding of the legal 
and administrative errors that re-
sult in firearms falling into the 
wrong hands could help move this 
discussion forward.
The United States has a long 
history of prioritizing the rights 
of gun owners over public safety. 
In 1992, after leaving the Office 
of the Surgeon General, C. Everett 
Koop wrote an editorial address-
ing violence as a public health is-
sue.5 He focused on firearm inju-
ries and proposed that anyone 
owning or operating a firearm be 
required to meet specific criteria, 
such as being monitored in the 
firearm’s use. The recommenda-
tions were never implemented. 
During his Senate confirmation 
hearings to become Surgeon Gen-
eral in 2014, Vivek Murthy char-

acterized the problems surround-
ing firearm violence in the United 
States as public health concerns. 
His support for gun control led to 
his appointment’s being delayed 
for several months. After Murthy’s 
confirmation, the political climate 
limited his office’s ability to cham-
pion firearm safety. A 2011 Florida 
law sought to prevent physicians 
from discussing firearm owner-
ship with their patients; the ban 
was struck down by the 11th Cir-
cuit Court of Appeals in 2017.
In the aftermath of the Las Ve-
gas and Parkland shootings, how-
ever, the tone of the conversation 
has changed. Perhaps the time has 
arrived to commission the first 
Surgeon General’s report on fire-
arm injuries and violence preven-
tion to stress the importance of 
collecting and disseminating data 
on the true nature of the public 
health problem we are facing. The 
United States could then begin 
using a public health approach to 
incorporate the principles of re-
sponsible and safe firearm owner-
ship into the legal interpretation of 
the Second Amendment to ensure 
a safer future.
