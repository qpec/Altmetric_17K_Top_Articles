ABSTRACT
Prior data in women suggest that incident clinically undiagnosed radiographic vertebral fractures (VFs) often are symptomatic, but
misclassification of incident clinical VF may have biased these estimates. There are no comparable data in men. To evaluate the
association of incident clinically undiagnosed radiographic VF with back pain symptoms and associated activity limitations, we used
data from the Osteoporotic Fractures in Men (MrOS) Study, a prospective cohort study of community-dwelling men aged �65 years.
A total of 4396 men completed spine X-rays and symptom questionnaires at baseline and visit 2, about 4.6 years later. Incident
clinical VFs during this interval were defined by self-reported clinical diagnosis plus community imaging showing a centrally
adjudicated �1 increase in semiquantitative (SQ) grade in any thoracic or lumbar vertebra versus baseline study X-rays. Incident
radiographic VFs (�1 increase in SQ grade between baseline and visit 2 study X-rays) were categorized as radiographic-only (not
clinically diagnosed) or radiographic plus clinical (also clinically diagnosed). Multivariable-adjusted log binomial regression was used
to calculate prevalence ratios (PRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Men with incident radiographic plus clinical VF were most
likely to have back pain symptoms and associated activity limitation at follow-up. However, versus men without incident VF, those
with incident radiographic-only VF also were significantly more likely at follow-up to report any back pain (70% versus 59%; PR, 1.2
[95% CI, 1.1 to 1.3]), severe back pain (8% versus 4%; PR, 1.9 [95% CI, 1.1 to 3.3]), bother from back pain most/all the time (22% versus
13%; PR, 1.7 [95% CI, 1.3 to 2.2]), and limited usual activity from back pain (34% versus 18%; PR, 1.9 [95% CI, 1.5 to 2.4]). Clinically
undiagnosed, incident radiographic VFs were associated with an increased likelihood of back pain symptoms and associated activity
limitation. Results suggest incident radiographic-only VFs often were symptomatic, and were associated with both new and
worsening back pain. Preventing these fractures may reduce back pain and related disability in older men. © 2017 American Society

 Introduction
V
ertebral fractures (VFs) are a common hallmark of osteopo-
rosis in older adults.(1,2) Clinically diagnosed VFs are
associated with increased back pain, disability, and an increased
risk of future fractures.(3,4) However, most new VFs are not
clinically diagnosed. Only about a quarter of incident radio-
graphic VFs are clinically recognized in women,(5–9) and the
proportion of men whose incident VFs are clinically recognized
appears even lower.(6,10)
This does not mean that clinically unrecognized incident
radiographic VFs are always asymptomatic. In one large cohort of
older women, those with an incident radiographic VF who didnot
report a clinical VF had a significantly greater risk of increased
back pain and back-related disability compared to women
with no incident VF.(7) However, because this study did not
confirm self-reported clinical VF by comparing community spine
imaging to baseline study radiographs, some women likely
had unchanged prevalent VF and were incorrectly categorized
as having new clinical VF. Relative to the no VF group, this
misclassification could have led to overestimation of the pain and
disability in women with incident radiographic-only VF.Even with
these limitations, there are no comparable data available in men.
The Osteoporotic Fractures in Men (MrOS) study was
designed with a co-primary aim of evaluating the effects of
fractures on quality of life in older men.(11) To this end, it enrolled
a large cohort of men aged �65 years, and collected baseline
and follow-up spine radiographs, including community imaging
studies in men who reported new clinical VF, as well as repeated
self-reports about back pain symptoms. Using these data, we
aimed to investigate the impact of clinically undiagnosed
incident radiographic VF on back pain symptoms in older men.
We hypothesized that clinically unrecognized incident radio-
graphic VF would be associated with back pain symptoms and
associated disability intermediate in frequency and severity
between that experienced in men with no incident VF and those
with incident clinical VF.
Subjects and Methods
Participants
A total of 5994 community-dwelling men aged �65 years were
recruited from population-based listings to participate in the
MrOS prospective cohort study between 2000 and 2002 at six
US sites: Birmingham, AL; Minneapolis, MN; Palo Alto, CA;
Monongahela Valley near Pittsburgh, PA; Portland, OR; and San
Diego, CA. MrOS exclusion criteria included inability to walk
without assistance from another person, a history of bilateral hip
replacement,inability to consent,or expected survival ofless than
6 months. Institutional review boards at all participating centers
approved the study protocol and written informed consent was
obtained from all participants. The MrOS study design and
recruitment have been described in detail elsewhere.(11,12)
Among all MrOS enrollees, 4396 (73%) completed technically
adequate lumbar and thoracic spine radiographs and a self-
reported back pain symptom questionnaire at both baseline and
visit 2 (mean of 4.6 � 0.4 SD years after baseline), forming our
analysis cohort.
Incident radiographic VFs
Radiographic VF assessment in the MrOS study has been
detailed elsewhere.(13) Briefly, lateral thoracic and lumbar spine
radiographs were performed according to protocol and triaged
by trained technicians. Then, all films considered to have a
possible fracture or other abnormality (“triage positive”) were
evaluated by a study physician reader (JTS) using the Genant
semiquantitative (SQ) grading method to rate each vertebral
level for fracture,(14) with the modification that grade 1 fractures
had to exhibit cortical discontinuity or depression of most of
either the superior or inferior endplate to be considered
fractured.(13) This physician reader was blinded to all participant
characteristics, including whether or not a clinical vertebral
fracture had been diagnosed between MrOS baseline and visit 2.
Participants were defined as having a prevalent radiographic
VF when any baseline thoracic or lumbar vertebra had an SQ
grade of �2, and an incident radiographic VF when any thoracic
or lumbar vertebra had an increase in SQ grade of �1 between
baseline and visit 2.
Incident clinical VFs
Participants were contacted by mail or phone every 4 months
and queried about new fractures; >99% of these attempted
contacts were completed. For men who reported a new
community-diagnosed clinical VF, information about the circum-
stances of the VF was collected using a standardized question-
naire. Only participants for whom a central study physician
judged that their community spine imaging (eg, radiograph, CT,
MRI) showed an increase in SQ grade of �1 compared to the
same thoracic or lumbar vertebrae on the baseline study
radiograph were categorized as having an incident clinical VF
in the current study.
Back pain symptoms
At both baseline and visit 2, participants self-reported presence
of back pain during the past year (yes, no), and then rated its
severity (mild, moderate, severe), how often they were bothered
by back pain (never, rarely, some of the time, most of the time, all
the time), and whether they had limited their usual activity
because of back pain (yes, no).
Other measurements
All covariate measures were collected at MrOS baseline. These
included date of birth, race (white versus nonwhite), Physical
Activity Scale for the Elderly (PASE) score,(15) self-reported health
(good-excellent versus not), falls in the past year, and
impairment in any of five instrumental activities of daily living
(IADLs) (walking two to three blocks, climbing 10 steps,
preparing their own meals, doing heavy housework, shopping
for groceries or clothes). A medication inventory was used to
classify medications used within the preceding 30 days into
categories by their ingredients, including analgesics and
osteoporosis medications. Study staff measured each partic-
ipant’s height (stadiometer) and weight (balance beam or
digital scale), from which we calculated body mass index (BMI) as
kg/m2. Areal bone mineral density (BMD) (g/cm2) was measured
at the right hip and lumbar spine using dual-energy X-ray
absorptiometry (DXA) (QDR4500W; Hologic, Inc., Waltham, MA,
USA), unless the participant reported a right hip replacement or
metal objects in the right leg, in which case the left hip was
measured. MrOS DXA quality assurance measures have been
detailed.(11) Based on common phantoms measured at all clinics,
variability across clinics was limited, and cross-calibration
correction factors were not required. Precision of spine and

 hip DXA scans was 1% to 2%. Analgesic and osteoporosis
medication use also was ascertained for the 30 days prior to
visit 2.
Statistical analyses
Participants were categorized into men with no incident VF,
those with incident radiographic-only VF (not clinically diag-
nosed), and those with incident radiographic plus clinical VF
(also clinically diagnosed). Among the 31 men with confirmed
incident clinical VF, three were judged not to have had an
incident radiographic VF when the baseline and visit 2 MrOS
spine radiographs were compared; these three men were
excluded from analyses due to inadequate numbers. Differences
in baseline and visit 2 characteristics between participants
with no incident VF, incident radiographic-only VF, and
incident radiographic plus clinical VF were assessed using
chi-square tests for categorical data and ANOVA for continu-
ous data.
To evaluate whether, compared to men with no incident VF,
those with incident radiographic-only VF, and incident radio-
graphic plus clinical VF between baseline and visit 2 had an
associated increased risk of back pain symptoms at visit 2 (any
back pain, severe back pain, bother most or all the time by back
pain, and limitation in usual activities due to back pain), we
performed log binomial regression analyses or Poisson regres-
sion, calculating prevalence ratios (PRs) and 95% confidence
intervals (CIs). All models first were adjusted for age, race, and
clinic site. Models then additionally were adjusted for baseline
IADL impairment, lumbar spine BMD, prevalence of radiographic
VF, baseline prevalence of the corresponding back pain
symptom (ie, analysis for visit 2 any back pain adjusted for
baseline prevalence of any back pain), history of fall in the year
before baseline, and visit 2 analgesic use. We performed several
sensitivity analyses: (i) stratifying participants based on whether
or not they reported any back pain at baseline; (ii) comparing
men with no incident VF to men with more radiographically
severe incident VF based on an increase in SQ grade of �2 (76%
of men with incident radiographic VF); and (iii) both excluding
the 1.6% of men who reported baseline osteoporosis medication
use and adjusting for visit 2 osteoporosis medication use.
Results
Between baseline and visit 2, 169 men (3.8%) had an incident
radiographic-only VF and 28 (0.6%) had an incident radiographic
plus clinical VF. Overall, though men were predominately white,
overweight, and reported mostly good to excellent health, there
were several baseline differences between men who did and did
not have subsequent VF. Compared to the 4196 men who did
not have an incident radiographic VF, the 169 men with an
incident radiographic VF, and 28 with an incident radiographic
plus clinical VF were significantly older, had lower lumbar spine
BMD, and more often had IADL impairment and a prevalent
radiographic VF at baseline (Table 1). Men who had no
incident VF had been most healthy at baseline, those who
had incident radiographic plus clinical VF were least healthy at

ASSOCIATION OF UNDIAGNOSED VF WITH FOLLOW-UP BACK PAIN IN OLDER MEN

 baseline, and those with incident radiographic-only VF had
intermediate baseline health status. All but one of the 28 men
with an incident radiographic plus clinical VF reported the
circumstances that led to being given a diagnosis of clinical VF in
the community, and back pain was the presenting complaint in
89% of cases.
Association of incident VFs with back pain symptoms
and associated activity limitations
In multivariable-adjusted analyses, compared to men with
no incident VF, those with an incident radiographic-only VF
between baseline and visit 2 were significantly more likely at
visit 2 to report any back pain (70% versus 59%; PR, 1.2 [95% CI,
1.1 to 1.3]), severe back pain (8% versus 4%; PR, 1.9 [95% CI, 1.1 to
3.3]), bother most or all the time by back pain (22% versus
13%; PR, 1.7 [95% CI, 1.3 to 2.2]), and limited usual activities
due to back pain (34% versus 18%; PR, 1.9 [95% CI, 1.5 to 2.4])
(Table 2). These results appeared intermediate between
those in men with no VF and those in men with an incident
radiographic plus clinical VF. In multivariable-adjusted analyses,
compared to men with no incident VF, those with an incident
radiographic plus clinical VF were significantly more likely at visit
2 to report any back pain (93% versus 59%; PR, 1.6 [95% CI, 1.4 to
1.9]), severe back pain (18% versus 4%; PR, 3.4 [95% CI, 1.3 to
9.8]), to be bothered most or all the time by back pain (50%
versus 13%; PR, 4.0 [95% CI, 2.5 to 6.4]), and limited usual
activities due to back pain (64% versus 18%; PR, 3.7 [95% CI, 2.2
to 5.5]).
In the subgroup of men without baseline back pain, those
with an incident radiographic-only VF had a 13.8% absolute
increase in risk of any back pain at follow-up compared to that
in men with no incident VF (Table 2). In the subgroup of men
with baseline back pain, there was a 5.7%, 15.3%, and 23.8%
absolute increase, respectively, in risk of severe, frequently
bothersome, or activity limiting back pain at follow-up in
those with an incident radiographic-only VF compared to
that in men with no incident VF (Table 2), and a 22.2%
absolute increase in risk of one or more of these symptoms at
follow-up.
Results were similar to overall results in several other sensitivity
analyses, including in analyses excluding the 7% of men with a
prevalent radiographic VF at baseline, in analyses comparing
men with no incident VF to men with more radiographically
severe incident VF based on an increase in SQ grade of �2, and in
analyses excluding men with baseline osteoporosis medication
useandadjustingforvisit2osteoporosismedicationuse(datanot
shown).
Discussion
In this cohort of community-dwelling older men, those with
clinically undiagnosed incident radiographic VFs were signifi-
cantly more likely to have back pain symptoms and activity
limitations due to back pain at follow-up than were men without
incident VF. Though men with incident radiographic VF were
older, had poorer health status, and more frequently had
prevalent radiographic VF at baseline than men with no incident
VF, differences in these characteristics did not appear to explain
the association of incident clinically undiagnosed radiographic
VF with back pain symptoms at follow-up. Analyses stratified by
whether or not individuals had back pain at baseline suggest
that incident clinically undiagnosed radiographic VFs were
symptomatic in a substantial minority of men with these events,
and were associated with a mix of new back pain and worsening
of preexisting back pain.
Results from the current study about the association between
incident clinically undiagnosed VF and back pain symptoms are
consistent with results previously reported in older community-
dwelling women, both in the direction of the association and its
magnitude. In the Study of Osteoporotic Fractures (SOF), women
aged �65 years with new, clinically undiagnosed radiographic
VF during 3.7 years of follow-up had about a twofold higher risk
of increased back pain, increased back-related disability, and of
having at least 1 day of bed rest and 7 days of activity limitation
due to back pain between baseline and follow-up compared to
women with no incident VF.(7) SOF may have misclassified some
old VFs as new clinical VFs due to not obtaining community
imaging to compare to baseline study radiographs, and thus
overestimated the proportion of new VFs that were clinically
diagnosed. Further, this likely also resulted in SOF under-
estimating symptoms associated with incident clinical VFs and
overestimating symptoms associated with incident radio-
graphic-only VFs. However, the general similarity of our results
to theirs suggests this potential bias was unlikely to be large.
Current study results went further by estimating the excess
absolute risk of back pain symptoms associated with incident
clinically undiagnosed radiographic VF. In the MrOS cohort, with
a 67% prevalence of back pain at baseline, about 20% of men
with incident clinically undiagnosed radiographic VF had new or
worse back pain in excess of that observed in men without
incident VF.
The current study has several important strengths, including
its enrollment of a large cohort of community-dwelling older
men. Additional strengths include its prospective design, with
frequent and complete follow-up to ascertain incident clinical
VF, and its use of consistent and validated approaches for
adjudicating both incident clinical VF and incident radiographic
VF. Further, analyses were adjusted for multiple potential
confounders.
These analyses also have several limitations. First, measures
used to assess back pain symptoms and associated activity
limitations were self-reported and may have been subject to
errors in recall. However, any errors are unlikely to have differed
systematically by incident radiographic-only VF status because
these VFs were not clinically detected. Thus, any recall errors
likely would have biased results toward the null. Second,
analyses could have underestimated the association between
incident radiographic-only VFs and new or worsened back pain
symptoms in individuals whose fracture symptoms resolved
more than 1 year before visit 2. Third, because the exact dates of
incident radiographic VFs are unknown, some men may have
developed new or worsened back pain symptoms prior to their
incident VF. Fourth, it is possible that analyses could have
underestimated the association between incident radiographic-
only VF and worsened back pain symptoms because of ceiling
effects in men who already had severe, frequently bothersome,
and/or activity limiting back pain at baseline. Fifth, there were a
relatively small number of men who had radiographic plus
clinical VF. Sixth, although most community imaging studies
that led to community diagnoses of incident clinical VF were
performed to evaluate back pain, a minority may have been
incidental findings. This would have biased results for clinical VF
toward the null. Seventh, because statistical power likely was
limited
for
subgroup
analyses,
these
results
should
be
interpreted cautiously. Finally, because MrOS participants are

had an incident radiographic only VFs, and 11 had an incident radiographic plus clinical VFs.
cResults not modeled because the number of incident radiographic plus clinical VFs was too small in this subgroup to provide stable estimates of risk of this back pain outcome.

ASSOCIATION OF UNDIAGNOSED VF WITH FOLLOW-UP BACK PAIN IN OLDER MEN
5
 community-dwelling, largely healthy older men, our findings
may have limited applicability to other populations.
In conclusion, incident, clinically undiagnosed radiographic
VFs were associated with a significantly increased likelihood of
back pain symptoms and associated activity limitation in a large
cohort of older men. These results appear to be independent of
other explanatory factors and build on similar results previously
reported in older women.(7) About one in five men with incident
radiographic-only VF had new or worse back pain in excess of
what was observed in men without incident VF. These results
suggest that incident radiographic-only VFs are clinically
important patient outcomes. Preventing these fractures may
reduce back pain and related disability in older men. Random-
ized trials to prevent such fractures will provide the strongest
evidence about the effect of interventions on back pain and
related disability in older adults.
