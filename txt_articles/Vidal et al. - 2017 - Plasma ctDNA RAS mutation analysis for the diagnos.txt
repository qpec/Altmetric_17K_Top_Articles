Background: RAS assessment is mandatory for therapy decision in metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) patients. This
determination is based on tumor tissue, however, genotyping of circulating tumor (ct)DNA offers clear advantages as a
minimally invasive method that represents tumor heterogeneity. Our study aims to evaluate the use of ctDNA as an alternative
for determining baseline RAS status and subsequent monitoring of RAS mutations during therapy as a component of routine
clinical practice.
Patients and methods: RAS mutational status in plasma was evaluated in mCRC patients by OncoBEAMTM RAS CRC assay.
Concordance of results in plasma and tissue was retrospectively evaluated. RAS mutations were also prospectively monitored in
longitudinal plasma samples from selected patients.
Results: Analysis of RAS in tissue and plasma samples from 115 mCRC patients showed a 93% overall agreement. Plasma/tissue
RAS discrepancies were mainly explained by spatial and temporal tumor heterogeneity. Analysis of clinico-pathological features
showed that the site of metastasis (i.e. peritoneal, lung), the histology of the tumor (i.e. mucinous) and administration of treat-
ment previous to blood collection negatively impacted the detection of RAS in ctDNA. In patients with baseline mutant RAS
tumors treated with chemotherapy/antiangiogenic, longitudinal analysis of RAS ctDNA mirrored response to treatment, being
an early predictor of response. In patients RAS wt, longitudinal monitoring of RAS ctDNA revealed that OncoBEAM was useful to
detect emergence of RAS mutations during anti-EGFR treatment.
Conclusion: The high overall agreement in RAS mutational assessment between plasma and tissue supports blood-based test-
ing with OncoBEAMTM as a viable alternative for genotyping RAS of mCRC patients in routine clinical practice. Our study de-
scribes practical clinico-pathological specifications to optimize RAS ctDNA determination. Moreover, OncoBEAMTM is useful to
monitor RAS in patients undergoing systemic therapy to detect resistance and evaluate the efficacy of particular treatments.

Introduction
Monoclonal antibodies (moAb) directed against EGFR—cetuxi-
mab and panitumumab—are standard components of treatment
regimens for metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) patients, ei-
ther alone or in combination with chemotherapy. The current
standard of care is to determine mutations in RAS in all mCRC
tumors before initiating treatment, as critical biomarkers of

 innate resistance to anti-EGFR [1]. Moreover, all mCRC patients
that initially respond to anti-EGFR therapy eventually develop re-
sistance, which in �50% of cases is due to the emergence of RAS
mutations [2–5]. Currently, RAS mutation determination is car-
ried out in formalin fixed paraffin-embedded samples from
tumor tissue.
Circulating DNA fragments carrying tumor specific sequence
alterations (circulating tumor DNA, ctDNA) are found in the
cell-free fraction of blood, representing a variable and generally
small fraction of the total circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA).
Tumor genotyping using ctDNA offers potential advantages par-
ticularly in the metastatic setting as a safe minimally invasive al-
ternative to tissue [3].
Prior studies have demonstrated a high degree of concordance
between somatic mutations detected in tumor tissue and those
determined in ctDNA of patients with advanced tumors [6, 7]. The
use of ctDNA has also demonstrated utility to predict treatment re-
sponse to chemotherapy. Previous ctDNA studies utilized mas-
sively parallel (direct) sequencing of tumor tissue in order to
identify somatic alterations specific to individual patients, which
were subsequently incorporated into the development of a person-
alized gene panel to detect these mutations in blood samples.
Although useful in a research setting, a personalized NGS panel ap-
proach is currently not amenable to routine clinical practice in that
it requires significant dedicated resources in highly qualified re-
search laboratories. Alternatively, blood-based tests that encom-
pass a panel of the most frequently occurring mutations for a given
tumor type and which can be used to interrogate the plasma of pa-
tients with high sensitivity present a practical approach for routine
clinical care. The first and only test thus far for the determination
of RAS mutations in ctDNA with European Conformity (CE-
marked) in vitro diagnostic (CE-IVD) is the OncoBEAM RAS
CRC assay, which detects 34 mutations in exons 2, 3, and 4 in the
KRAS and NRAS genes as recommended by current clinical prac-
tice treatment guidelines (NCCN, ESMO, EMA).
The aim of the present study was to evaluate the clinical appli-
cations of the OncoBEAM RAS CRC assay in routine clinical
practice for the diagnosis, assessment of response to chemother-
apy/antiangiogenic treatment and monitoring of acquired resist-
ance to anti-EGFR therapy in mCRC patients.
Materials and methods
Study design and sample collection
A retrospective-prospective study was carried out in two Spanish
Institutions. Patients with histologically confirmed metastatic colorectal
cancer and anti-EGFR treatment naı
¨ve were eligible for the study. Blood
samples were collected in all patients before the administration of anti-
EGFR treatment. For those patients undergoing monitoring, serial blood
samples were collected every 4 weeks coinciding with the treatment visit
and at the moment of progressive disease. See full inclusion criteria and
regulatory aspects in supplementary material, available at Annals of
Oncology online.
OncoBEAMTM RAS CRC assay was used to detect RAS mutations in
plasma, and RAS mutation detection in tissue samples were carried out
according to standard-of-care (SoC) procedures validated by each hos-
pital (details in supplementary material and Table S4, available at Annals
of Oncology online).
Statistical analysis
Variables were described using median and interquartile range (IQR)
when continuous, and percentage when categorical. For mutant allele
fraction (MAF) levels comparisons between different groups regarding
clinical variables, we carried out Mann–Whitney U test for dichotomic
variables and Kruskal–Wallis test for polycothomic variables. Tests were
carried out under SPSS v.22 with a significance level of P < 0.05.
Graphics were built using R 3.3.1.
Results
Patient characteristics and concordance of
extended RAS determination in plasma versus
tissue
From June 2009 to August 2016, 115 patients with mCRC were
included, all of them had at least one baseline blood draw. Study
flowchart is presented in Figure 1. Clinico-pathological charac-
teristics of the patients are described in supplementary Table S1,
available at Annals of Oncology online. At the time of basal ctDNA
collection, all patients were naı
¨ve to anti-EGFR treatment and 82
patients (71%) had not received any therapy in the metastatic set-
ting. The median time from tumor tissue specimen collection to
ctDNA collection was 47.5 days (range 0–1783 days) in therapy-
naı
¨ve patients.
Of the 115 patients included in the study, 55 (47.8%) and 59
(51.3%) were shown to have RAS mutations in their tumor sam-
ples as detected by SoC RAS tissue testing and as detected in
ctDNA by RAS OncoBEAM, respectively (supplementary Figure
S1, available at Annals of Oncology online). The overall concord-
ance of RAS results between ctDNA RAS OncoBEAM assay and
standard techniques for tissue analysis was 93% (107/115 pa-
tients), kappa index 0.844 (95% CI 0.746–0.941) (Figure 2).
Characterization of RAS tissue versus RAS plasma
discordant cases
Among 55 patients in whom a RAS mutation was detected in tis-
sue, 53 also had a RAS mutation in plasma (positive percentage
agreement, PPA of 96.4%) (Figure 2). There were only two cases
with RAS mutated tissue in whom no RAS mutation was detected
in ctDNA. Both had localized tumors at the time of diagnosis that
were initially removed. At relapse, when ctDNA extraction was
carried out, both patients had minimal tumor burden: one with
only peritoneum metastasis and the other had one infra-
centimetric lung metastasis and one single implant in the
peritoneum.
Among 60 patients determined to be RAS wt in tissue, no RAS
mutations were observed in ctDNA in 54 cases (negative percent-
age agreement, NPA of 90%). In the remaining 6 patients, plasma
RAS BEAMing detected a RAS mutation that SoC tissue testing
had not revealed. In all of these cases, the primary tumor served
as the source for RAS mutational analysis and had been removed
before ctDNA sampling. Notably, all six patients had, at least,
liver metastasis when blood was drawn for ctDNA analysis.
Interestingly, in five out of the six RAS tissue-/plasmaþ dis-
cordant cases, the RAS MAF detected in ctDNA was under 1%.
We compared the MAF of concordant and discordant cases.

 As shown in Figure 3A, there was a trend towards lower RAS
plasma MAF in discordant cases compared with patients with
concordant RAS in tissue and plasma (median RAS MAF 0.281%
and 2.317%, respectively; P¼0.193).
Differences in RAS ctDNA MAF according to clinico-
pathological characteristics
The global median RAS plasma MAF was 1.84% (IQR: 0.284–
11.290) (supplementary Table S1, available at Annals of Oncology
online). No differences in MAFs were observed in relation to age,
gender, initial stage at diagnosis or primary site of disease (right
versus left).
While no differences in RAS MAF were seen in relation to the
number of metastatic sites, differences were observed depending
on the site of metastasis location (Figure 3B and C). Patients with
liver involvement had higher RAS ctDNA compared with those
without liver metastases (4.806% versus 0.203%; P¼0.001). In
contrast, MAF from patients having only peritoneum metastases
was lower (0.1%) than patients without peritoneum involvement
(4.026%), than patients with peritoneum metastasis in addition
to at least one other metastatic site (1.109%; P ¼0.056). MAF was
lower in patients with only lung metastatic involvement
(0.033%). Of note, in two patients that presented with tumors
having mucinous histology MAF was below the median (0.451%
and 0.161%, respectively; P < 0.05).

 We then sought to analyze the impact of treatment on RAS
mutation detection in plasma. No differences were observed in
RAS plasma MAF between patients in whom the primary tumor
had been removed before basal ctDNA extraction (4.026%) and
patients in whom ctDNA was extracted from blood drawn at the
time primary tumors had not been resected (1.558%; P¼0.584).
Regarding the relation between systemic treatment and plasma
RAS mutation detection, 8 of 59 RAS mutant patients (13.6%)
had received previous treatment with chemotherapy (comprising
5FU, oxaliplatin and/or irinotecan) 6 anti-VEGF within a month
prior ctDNA blood extraction. In all of these patients, lower RAS
plasma MAFs were observed (0.173%; range 0.074–1.156) when
compared with treatment-naı
¨ve patients (4.178%; range 0.451–
12.620; P¼0.007) (Figure 3D), emphasizing the relevance of
blood draw timing for an accurate RAS determination.
Response to anti-EGFR therapy and prognosis
according to baseline RAS ctDNA determination
We then determined the impact of RAS detection in predicting
response to anti-EGFR based therapy. Among 54 patients having
RAS wt tumor tissue, 34 were treated with anti-EGFR monoclo-
nal antibodies (31 with cetuximab and 3 with panitumumab-
based regimens; 30 plus chemotherapy and 4 in monotherapy).
Twenty-three achieved a complete or partial response (68%) and
7 patients (20%) had stable disease for more than 16 weeks.
Among tissue RAS wt patients treated with anti-EGFR therapy,
four were found to have a plasma RAS positive result (Figure 2,
discordant patients #1, #2, #4, #5). Three of them achieved a par-
tial response, whereas one showed progressive disease after ad-
ministration of anti-EGFR treatment.
Despite the retrospective nature of our study, we determined
the progression-free survival (PFS) according to RAS mutation
determination in plasma and RAS mutation determination in tis-
sue. PFS was 10.3 month (95% CI 7.7–25) for wt RAS tissue pa-
tients and 10.3 months (95% CI 7.7–19.8) for RAS wt plasma
patients.
In addition, baseline high RAS ctDNA MAF have been associ-
ated with low survival [8]. We analyzed the prognosis impact of
basal MAF levels in a cohort of 22 patients with at least 3 year of
follow-up. Patients with MAF levels �1% had significant lower
PFS and OS than those with basal levels <1% (supplementary
Figure S2, available at Annals of Oncology online). These data
suggest that ctDNA levels could also provide valuable informa-
tion to predict the disease evolution in RAS mutant patients be-
fore treatment onset.
Longitudinal ctDNA RAS testing for assessing
response to patients treated with systemic
treatment
Because ctDNA analysis has the capacity to reflect tumor load
[2], we examined the utility of OncoBEAM RAS CRC ctDNA
testing to monitor the efficacy of response of patients to
treatment.
RAS was longitudinally monitored in serial blood draws from
21 patients with baseline RAS mutations undergoing systemic
therapy. Seven patients were treated with combination chemo-
therapy þ antiangiogenic therapy, 12 received chemotherapy
alone and 2 anti-EGFR-based treatment (supplementary Table
S2, available at Annals of Oncology online). A first CT-scan was
carried out concurrent with the ctDNA RAS monitoring to evalu-
ate tumor response after 8–12 weeks of treatment. Analysis of
RAS ctDNA at the time of this first CT-scan revealed a dramatic
decrease in plasma RAS MAF in responding patients with a me-
dian of 100%. For patients with clinical response to treatment, no
differences in MAFs were observed in relation to the type of re-
sponse achieved (median MAF reduction in patients with SD
99% versus 100% in patients with PR; P ¼ 0.21). However, MAF
percentage of change was significantly lower in patients that pro-
gressed at first evaluation of response compared with patients
with clinical benefit (PR þ SD) (132% increase versus 99% reduc-
tion, respectively, P ¼ 0.027)
In 10 out of 11 responding patients that subsequently pro-
gressed, RAS ctDNA MAF increased accordingly, though in most
cases patients exhibited lower MAFs than at the time of diagnosis
(Figure 4A; supplementary Table S2, available at Annals of
Oncology online). Of note, in one patient having a basal KRAS
mutation in codon 12 (basal RAS MAF 9.12%), a decrease in RAS
MAF was initially observed that was quickly followed by an in-
crease in RAS MAF at week 12 although the CT scan showed sta-
ble disease. This patient subsequently showed a rapid progression
of disease and died 4 months later.
Representative time courses of ctDNA along with clinical and
radiologic data on two subjects are provided (Figure 4C and D),
showing the high accuracy of RAS plasma ctDNA dynamics as a

Decline and increase in circulating RAS MAF correlate with response and progression to treatment, respectively. (B) RAS ctDNA dynamics in 5
patients with RAS mutated tumors that progressed at first CTscan at 8–12 weeks from beginning of treatment. (C) Patient diagnosed with
stage IV rectal cancer with liver metastasis. An NRAS codon 61 mutation was detected in tissue and plasma. After 4 weeks of treatment with
FOLFOX þ bevacizumab, plasma MAF dramatically decreased correlating with a stable disease observed in the CT-scan at week 12. The pa-
tient underwent surgery of the primary tumor and liver metastasis, and plasma RAS became undetectable. Eight months later, the patient
relapsed and RAS MAF increased accordingly. Three months after initiating second line treatment with FOLFIRI þ aflibercept, the patient
achieved a stable disease by CT scan, and no plasma ctDNA RAS mutations were detected. (D) Monitoring ctDNA KRAS codon 146 mutation
during treatment with FOLFOX-Bevacizumab in patient #3, diagnosed with a stage IV colon cancer with lung and liver metastasis. The colo-
noscopic biopsy analysis was RAS wt but plasma ctDNA showed a KRAS codon 146 mutation. Following removal of the primary tumor, re-
analysis of RAS in the surgical sample confirmed the plasma result. The patient received FOLFOX þ bevacizumab with an early decrease in
RAS ctDNA that became undetectable at 12 weeks, alongside at the first CT scan. Treatment was discontinued and a subsequently increase in
KRAS codon 146 MAF was observed, which then rapidly decreased when the chemotherapy was reintroduced. Gray area indicates tumor
load. Blue line indicates changes in ctDNA KRAS146 frequency.

 surrogate marker of tumor load and a potential tool to evaluate

ctDNA extended RAS for monitoring RAS
mutations during and after withdrawal of
anti-EGFR therapy
We and others previously reported that acquired resistance to
anti-EGFR treatment is linked to the emergence of RAS muta-
tions, that can be tracked in the blood of patients [2, 3, 8, 9]. In
our study, we examined the value of OncoBEAM RAS CRC test-
ing to detect the emergence of RAS mutations during anti-EGFR
treatment. Plasma was available at the time of disease progression
from 18 cases with acquired resistance to anti-EGFR therapy (i.e.
disease progression after an initial complete response, partial re-
sponse or stable disease for more than 16 weeks). Emergence of
RAS mutations was detected in 7/18 patients (39%), 5 of them
treated with chemotherapy þ anti-EGFR and two with anti-
EGFR monotherapy (supplementary Table S3, available at Annals
of Oncology online). The most frequent mutations involved KRAS
codon 12, KRAS codon 13 and NRAS codon 61. In three cases,
different RAS mutations were concomitantly detected. Median
RAS MAF detected at the time of anti-EGFR progression was
2.17% (range 0.024–24.957).
Discussion
Our study demonstrates that OncoBEAM RAS CRC assay is an
efficient and accurate tool to be used in routine clinical practice
with several applications in mCRC patients, including determin-
ation of baseline RAS at diagnosis to decide anti-EGFR therapy,
assessment of efficacy to treatment and monitoring of the emer-
gence of RAS mutations as a mechanism of resistance to anti-
EGFR therapy.
The high overall agreement between baseline plasma and tissue
RAS mutation status demonstrated in more than 100 patients
evaluated in our study supports the use of blood-based testing
with OncoBEAMTM RAS CRC as a viable alternative to tissue
SoC for determining RAS mutation status in mCRC patients
treated in routine clinical practice. Previous studies have shown
that ctDNA can be detected in patients with mCRC by using per-
sonalized research panels with dPCR [7, 10, 11]. Recent publica-
tions have also shown a very high sensitivity with BEAMing to
detect ctDNA mutations [12, 13]. However, to the best of our
knowledge, this is the first study that explores the clinical use of
plasma RAS determination by using a CE-marked assay in a daily
clinical routine setting and in a large real world cohort of patients.
Moreover, the minimal level of discordance (6%) between RAS
tissue and plasma detection shown in our study is acceptable
from a clinical point of view. In fact, it is far lower than the 5%–
20% discrepancy found in RAS mutation detection when com-
paring two different tissue RAS testing SoC techniques [14, 15].
In an effort to explain plasma/tissue discrepancies as well as to
better understand the biology of circulating tumor DNA, we
identified several clinico-pathological features linked to low RAS
ctDNA detection, including peritoneal/lung metastases or mu-
cinous histology. In contrast, no correlation was found between
the number of metastasis and RAS ctDNA mutations in our
study. This data suggests that intrinsic biological characteristics
of the tumor rather than tumor burden may impact ctDNA re-
lease. In order to appreciate the utility and further optimize the
routine evaluation of RAS ctDNA determination in daily clinical
practice, we also studied external factors that may influence the
result of RAS ctDNA determination. We found that the adminis-
tration of recent systemic treatment had a clear negative impact
on the ability to detect RAS mutations in the blood of patients,
emphasizing the importance of collecting plasma for basal RAS
analysis before the initiation of any systemic treatment. On the
contrary removal of the primary tumor before blood draw for
RAS analysis did not impact the RAS mutation results. In global,
our study shows that the pattern of genetic alterations in cancer
patients is dynamic and is affected by intrinsic and extrinsic
factors.
Importantly, we also found a potential role of OncoBEAM
RAS ctDNA assay in monitoring response and resistance during
treatment. In patients with RAS mutant tumors, RAS plasma mir-
rored clinical and radiological response to treatment with chemo-
therapy drugs and was an early predictor of response. Likewise,
Tie et al. [10] reported changes in ctDNA for mCRC patients
treated with chemotherapy, although a more complex research-
based approach was used. Moreover, we showed a potential use
of RAS ctDNA in evaluating response to antiangiogenic drugs,
which could be complementary to RECIST. On the other hand,
in patients with RAS wt tumors treated with anti-EGFR,
OncoBEAM RAS CRC was a valid tool to detect RAS mutations
of resistance.
Despite the great value of the results presented, there are several
limitations
to
our
study.
It
is
a
retrospective
analysis.
Longitudinal blood extractions were only carried out in a limited
number of patients. Additionally, given the low number of pa-
tients with specific clinico-pathological characteristics, our infer-
ences from associations with P-values marginally <0.05% should
be cautiously interpreted.
Overall, our data show that the OncoBEAM RAS CRC assay
offers a minimally invasive and highly sensitive method for RAS
assessment in plasma of mCRC patients which can be readily im-
plemented into routine clinical practice to perform baseline diag-
nosis to select candidate patients to anti-EGR therapy. Moreover,
we show a potential use of OncoBEAM RAS in assessing the dy-
namics of RAS to monitor response and resistance to treatment
practice.
