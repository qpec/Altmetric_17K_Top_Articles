Abstract
Background
The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) provides approximately US$70 bil-
lion annually to support food purchases by low-income households, supporting approxi-
mately 1 in 7 Americans. In the 2018 Farm Bill, potential SNAP revisions to improve diets
and health could include financial incentives, disincentives, or restrictions for certain foods.
However, the overall and comparative impacts on health outcomes and costs are not estab-
lished. We aimed to estimate the health impact, program and healthcare costs, and cost-
effectiveness of food incentives, disincentives, or restrictions in SNAP.
Methods and findings
We used a validated microsimulation model (CVD-PREDICT), populated with national data
on adult SNAP participants from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES) 2009–2014, policy effects from SNAP pilots and food pricing meta-analyses,
diet–disease effects from meta-analyses, and policy, food, and healthcare costs from pub-
lished literature to estimate the overall and comparative impacts of 3 dietary policy interven-
tions: (1) a 30% incentive for fruits and vegetables (F&V), (2) a 30% F&V incentive with a
restriction of sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs), and (3) a broader incentive/disincentive
program for multiple foods that also preserves choice (SNAP-plus), combining 30% incen-
tives for F&V, nuts, whole grains, fish, and plant-based oils and 30% disincentives for SSBs,
junk food, and processed meats. Among approximately 14.5 million adults on SNAP at
baseline with mean age 52 years, our simulation estimates that the F&V incentive over 5

adjusted life years (QALYs), and save $1.21 billion in healthcare costs. Adding SSB restric-
tion increased gains to 93,933 CVD events prevented, 45,864 QALYs gained, and $4.33 bil-
lion saved. For SNAP-plus, corresponding gains were 116,875 CVD events prevented,
56,056 QALYs gained, and $5.28 billion saved. Over a lifetime, the F&V incentive would pre-
vent approximately 303,900 CVD events, gain 649,000 QALYs, and save $6.77 billion in
healthcare costs. Adding SSB restriction increased gains to approximately 797,900 CVD
events prevented, 2.11 million QALYs gained, and $39.16 billion in healthcare costs saved.
For SNAP-plus, corresponding gains were approximately 940,000 CVD events prevented,
2.47 million QALYs gained, and $41.93 billion saved. From a societal perspective (including
programmatic costs but excluding food subsidy costs as an intra-societal transfer), all 3 sce-
narios were cost-saving. From a government affordability perspective (i.e., incorporating
food subsidy costs, including for children and young adults for whom no health gains were
modeled), the F&V incentive was of low cost-effectiveness at 5 years (incremental cost-
effectiveness ratio: $548,053/QALY) but achieved cost-effectiveness ($66,525/QALY) over
a lifetime. Adding SSB restriction, the intervention was cost-effective at 10 years ($68,857/
QALY) and very cost-effective at 20 years ($26,435/QALY) and over a lifetime ($5,216/
QALY). The combined incentive/disincentive program produced the largest health gains
and reduced both healthcare and food costs, with net cost-savings of $10.16 billion at 5
years and $63.33 billion over a lifetime. Results were consistent in probabilistic sensitivity
analyses: for example, from a societal perspective, 1,000 of 1,000 iterations (100%) were
cost-saving for all 3 interventions. Due to the nature of simulation studies, the findings can-
not prove the health and cost impacts of national SNAP interventions.
Conclusions
Leveraging healthier eating through SNAP could generate substantial health benefits and
be cost-effective or cost-saving. A combined food incentive/disincentive program appears
most effective and may be most attractive to policy-makers.

Why was this study done?
• The US Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) provides approximately
$70 billion/year for food purchases for low-income households, supporting about 1 in 7

 What did the researchers do and find?
• Using nationally representative data and a validated microsimulation model, we evalu-
ated 3 potential interventions within SNAP, including (1) a 30% subsidy for purchases
of fruits and vegetables (F&V) (F&V incentive), (2) a F&V incentive with restriction of
sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) (F&V incentive/SSB restriction), and (3) a broader
incentive/disincentive program that preserves choice (SNAP-plus), combining a 30%
subsidy for purchases of F&V, nuts, whole grains, fish, and plant-based oils and a 30%
disincentive for purchases of SSBs, junk food, and processed meats.
• Over a lifetime, we found that the F&V incentive, F&V incentive/SSB restriction, and
SNAP-plus programs would prevent respectively about 304,000, 798,000, and 940,000
CVD events and −1,000, 171,000, and 147,000 cases of diabetes, with respective health-
care cost-savings of about $7 billion, $39 billion, and $429 billion. From a societal per-
spective, all interventions were cost-saving. From a government affordability
perspective (incorporating food subsidy costs for all 42 million participants in SNAP,
including children), the F&V incentive was cost-effective (lifetime incremental cost-
effectiveness ratio [ICER] approximately $66,500 per quality-adjusted life year), the
F&V incentive/SSB restriction policy was very cost-effective (ICER approximately
$5,200), and the SNAP-plus program was cost-saving (saving $63 billion).
What do these findings mean?
• Leveraging healthier eating through SNAP could generate substantial health benefits
among low-income Americans and be cost-effective or cost-saving.
• A combined food incentive/disincentive program produced the largest modeled gains
in health and healthcare savings.
• These findings support the need to test these SNAP interventions in state pilot
programs.
Introduction
Suboptimal diet is a major cause of poor health, particularly related to cardiometabolic diseases
such as coronary heart disease (CHD), stroke, type 2 diabetes, and obesity [1,2]. Nearly half of
all cardiovascular and diabetes deaths in the US are linked to poor diet, corresponding to
almost 1,000 deaths daily [3]. These adverse health conditions produce tremendous economic
burdens [2,4], including for government programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, private
health insurers, and self-insured businesses, and for individuals in the form of personal illness,
out-of-pocket costs, and lost productivity. The direct and indirect costs of cardiovascular dis-
eases (CVDs) are estimated at $317 billion/year, including $193 billion/year in direct health-
care expenditures and $124 billion/year in lost productivity, while the partly overlapping
corresponding costs of type 2 diabetes are $320, $112, and $208 billion/year, respectively. The
combined healthcare costs of all obesity-related conditions are estimated at $1.42 trillion/year,
or about 8% of US gross domestic product. Further, these diet-related diseases and costs

 disproportionately harm low-income individuals [4], contributing to major disparities.
Clearly, new cost-effective interventions are needed to address these burdens.
The US Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP, formerly the Food Stamp Pro-
gram) is among the largest and most promising opportunities to improve food choices and
health while reducing costs and disparities. Established by the Food Stamp Act in 1964 “to
safeguard the health and well-being of the Nation’s population and raise levels of nutrition
among low-income households” [5], SNAP provides monthly benefits for retail food purchases
to approximately 42 million low-income individuals, or approximately 1 in 7 Americans [6,7].
While SNAP is an essential safety net that successfully reduces food insecurity [8], relatively lit-
tle programmatic emphasis has been on nutrition or health. Disparities remain or have wors-
ened in the diets of low-income Americans [9–12], and SNAP participants experience
significantly higher all-cause, cardiovascular, and diabetes mortality compared to other Ameri-
can adults [13–15]. The size, scope, and potential for impact of SNAP are staggering, with an
annual budget of $68 billion/year that exceeds those of the National Institutes of Health ($33
billion), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ($7 billion), and Food and Drug Admin-
istration ($5 billion) combined [7].
SNAP is reauthorized by Congress every 5 years as part of the Farm Bill, due this year. With
its size and reach, the 2018 Farm Bill represents one of the most timely and compelling oppor-
tunities to improve the nation’s health. Tremendous current interest exists in potential ways to
further leverage SNAP to not only address food insecurity but also improve nutrition, health,
equity, and health costs [16–23]. For example, a new bipartisan Food Is Medicine Working
Group was recently launched in the US Congress to create innovative policies, including
within SNAP, to leverage food policy to improve health and to lower healthcare costs [16]. Sep-
arately, the influential Bipartisan Policy Center recently created a new SNAP Task Force, co-
chaired by former Senator Bill Frist and former US Department of Agriculture (USDA) Secre-
taries Dan Glickman and Ann Veneman, to provide policy recommendations for using SNAP
and related programs to improve health, combat poor nutrition, and reduce healthcare costs
[17]. Previously proposed revisions for SNAP have included incorporating financial incentives
for purchasing fruits, vegetables, or other healthful foods, and restricting unhealthy items such
as sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) [18–23]. The USDA Healthy Incentives Pilot (HIP), a
randomized controlled trial implemented among SNAP participants, demonstrated that a 30%
subsidy for fruits and vegetables (F&V) increased intake by approximately 26% [24]. Incentives
for healthful foods could also be combined with partial disincentives on less healthful items,
rather than absolute restrictions, preserving choice for participants. Yet, whereas economic
incentives and disincentives are known to be effective in changing behavior [24–27], the over-
all and comparative impacts of these different strategies on health outcomes, program and
healthcare costs, and cost-effectiveness are not established, limiting policy decision-making.
Policy-makers, practitioners, and the public are concerned about potential federal changes
to programs that aid Americans, requiring new research and data to support how SNAP bene-
fits may be strengthened and leveraged in a way that benefits participants and appeals to law-
makers. Understanding not only health impacts, but also costs and cost-effectiveness, is a
crucial tool for such conversations. To elucidate the effects of different strategies to improve
SNAP and provide evidence to help inform SNAP policy, a validated microsimulation model
was used to estimate the potential health impact of a F&V incentive, a F&V incentive plus SSB
restriction, and a combined incentive/disincentive program on multiple foods within SNAP
on cardiometabolic outcomes. Furthermore, the corresponding programmatic and healthcare
costs and comparative cost-effectiveness of these different strategies were evaluated. This work
was performed as part of the Food Policy Review and Intervention Cost-Effectiveness (Food-
PRICE) project (https://www.food-price.org/).

 Methods
Study overview
The potential health and economic impacts of implementing specific food incentive, restric-
tion, or disincentive programs within SNAP were modeled using the validated CVD-PRE-
DICT microsimulation model [28,29] over a 5-, 10-, and 20-year analytic period (2018–2038)
as well as over the cohort lifetime. Populated with individuals from the National Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), the CVD-PREDICT model utilized national data
on baseline characteristics, risks, dietary habits, and disease incidence to assess cumulative car-
diometabolic health outcomes and costs based on current trends as well as alternative scenar-
ios of specific interventions (Fig 1; S1 Text). At each stage of the logic pathway, the best
available evidence, supplemented with reasoned assumptions, was used to estimate the poten-
tial health and economic effects of the respective food price policies implemented among low-
income Americans participating in SNAP. The elements of the model inputs, structure, and
outputs are each described in further detail below. This investigation utilized de-identified
datasets and was exempt from human subjects approval.

 SNAP intervention scenarios
We modeled 3 distinct interventions within SNAP, including (1) a 30% financial incentive for
purchases of F&V (F&V incentive), (2) a 30% F&V incentive with restriction of SSBs (F&V
incentive/SSB restriction), and (3) a broader incentive/disincentive program that preserves
choice (SNAP-plus), combining a 30% financial incentive for purchases of F&V, nuts, whole
grains, fish, and plant-based oils and a 30% disincentive for purchases of SSBs, junk food, and
processed meats (see S1 Table for food category details and definitions). These 3 interventions
were predefined based on current policy evidence and interest in the US [17–24,27,30] (F&V
incentives and SSB restrictions) and worksite wellness and insurance benefit programs that
incentivize a broad range of healthy foods (SNAP-plus) [31,32], focusing on foods with the
largest estimated cardiometabolic impact in the US [3]. We performed a secondary analysis of
SNAP-plus excluding incentives for fish and plant-based oils, the 2 most expensive categories.
We modeled the implementation of each intervention through use of the existing SNAP
electronic benefits transfer (EBT) card, which can be used like a debit card at diverse retail out-
lets including supermarkets, grocery stores, convenience stores, and farmers markets and is
linked to product-identifying Universal Product Codes (UPCs). Use of EBT takes advantage of
this established system with existing product-specific inclusions and restrictions (e.g., pur-
chases of alcohol and preprepared hot foods are excluded), permitting technology-based finan-
cial nudges. In SNAP-plus, for example, for every SNAP dollar spent on incentivized foods,
$0.30 would be returned to the EBT account (producing a net additional expense to SNAP),
while for every SNAP dollar spent on disincentivized foods, $1.30 would be debited from the
EBT card (producing a net relative savings to SNAP that could help offset the cost of incen-
tives). Each intervention was accompanied by modeled coordinated outreach and education to
SNAP participants, accounted for in policy effect sizes and implementation and ongoing
annual costs (see below).
Simulated US population
Our population was based on Americans aged 35–80 years at baseline across 3 cycles of
NHANES (2009–2010, 2011–2012, 2013–2014) who participated in SNAP, defined by report-
ing household SNAP benefits in the past 12 months (Table 1). The sociodemographic charac-
teristics, cardiometabolic risk factors, and dietary habits of these participants were derived
from NHANES data, including dietary habits from two 24-hour recalls per person as previ-
ously described [9]. Utilizing NHANES survey weights to account for the complex survey
design and sampling, we sampled the study population with replacement to create a simulated
nationally representative SNAP population of 1,000,000 individuals, who were followed until
death or age 100, whichever came first. We recognized that individuals may enter and leave
SNAP over time, and considered this impact as further described in S2 Text. Data from
NHANES are publicly available at https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/; other data inputs are
from published papers or published in the present report.
Policy effects on dietary habits
Details of the sources for policy effects and corresponding calculations are provided in S2
Table. Estimated policy effects accounted for the expected change in intake of each food item
for a 30% price change, the percent of overall food purchased using SNAP dollars, the percent
of each food item purchased at SNAP venues (e.g., supermarkets, grocery stores, and farmers
markets, as opposed to restaurants and food banks), and the expected shifting in food spend-
ing from SNAP to other food dollars as a result of the intervention. Consistent with empirical
results of interventions that demonstrate rapid changes in consumption with price changes

 [24–26,34], we did not model any time lag between onset of the intervention and dietary
change.
The effects of the F&V incentive were derived from HIP, a randomized trial in SNAP par-
ticipants that provided a 30% subsidy for F&V purchases [24,25]. This effect size incorporated
the average coverage and participant response to the program, its corresponding outreach and
education, and potential shifts in spending between SNAP versus non-SNAP dollars (S3 Text).
For the combined incentive/disincentive program, this effect was extended to the other incen-
tivized food groups, as this provided a more conservative effect size than larger estimated
effects of price subsidies on healthful food items from a recent meta-analysis of interventional
and prospective studies [26]. While SSB restriction would prohibit purchases using SNAP dol-
lars, we recognized and accounted for the likely average response of individuals who might
shift some of their spending on SSBs from SNAP dollars to other food dollars, as noted above.
Accounting for each of these data sources and considerations, we estimated that a 30% F&V
incentive in SNAP would increase overall intake of fruits by 23.4% and vegetables by 19.0%; an
SSB restriction in SNAP would reduce overall intake of SSBs by 33.2%; a 30% incentive in
SNAP for other healthful foods would increase their overall intake by between 19.0% and
24.2%; and a 30% disincentive in SNAP for SSBs, junk food, and processed meats would
decrease their overall intake by between 13.3% and 17.4% (S2 Table). S2 Table also describes
several sensitivity analyses for these assumptions and corresponding calculations.
Effects of dietary changes on cardiometabolic risk
Our detailed methods for reviewing and synthesizing evidence to estimate effect sizes for asso-
ciations between dietary factors and cardiometabolic endpoints have been reported [1,3]. We
utilized evidence from meta-analyses of prospective cohorts or randomized clinical trials eval-
uating direct associations of dietary factors with CHD, stroke, or type 2 diabetes, by age; asso-
ciations of SSBs and added sugar from other foods with body mass index (BMI) and additional
BMI-independent associations of SSBs with CHD, stroke, and diabetes, by age and over-
weight/obesity status; and effects of dietary sodium on blood pressure, by age, race, and hyper-
tensive status (see S3 Table). To estimate cardiometabolic effects of junk food, we assessed the
independent relationship between US junk food consumption and 13 other dietary compo-
nents with established links to cardiometabolic risk (S4 Table), such as fruits, vegetables, whole
grains, nuts, omega-3 fats, potassium, red meat, processed meat, polyunsaturated fat as a
replacement for carbohydrate or saturated fat, and SSBs. Using the identified 9 joint associa-
tions, some of which predicted harm and some of which predicted benefit, we estimated the
etiologic effect of changes in junk food intake on cardiometabolic risk.
These estimated effects can model associations with cardiometabolic risk if there is not sub-
stantial bias from confounding (which might overestimate effects) or measurement error
(which might underestimate effects). To reduce bias from confounding, all identified observa-
tional studies in the utilized meta-analyses included multivariable adjustment for other risk
factors. Measurement error was generally not addressed, although some studies included serial
dietary measures. We also recognized that associations of individual dietary components with
health may differ from joint associations when foods are consumed as diet patterns: for exam-
ple, due to clustering of healthful components such as fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, or
unhealthful components such as SSBs and processed meats. We performed detailed validity
analyses evaluating the extent to which estimated etiologic effects might be biased due to these
limitations [1], including comparing estimated etiologic effects for individual dietary compo-
nents to (1) observed associations of overall dietary patterns with clinical endpoints in long-
term cohorts, (2) effects of dietary patterns on low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-

 cholesterol) and systolic blood pressure in randomized controlled feeding trials, and (3) effects
of dietary patterns on hard CVD endpoints in a large randomized clinical trial (S4 Text; S11–
S13 Tables). Each of these validity analyses demonstrated that estimated etiologic effects for
individual dietary components were very similar to what would be expected based on these
other lines of evidence [1]. These observed etiologic effects also inherently account for the
average dietary complements and substitutes in the population, as further described in S4
Text.
Microsimulation model structure and outputs
CVD-PREDICT is a validated discrete time microsimulation dynamic model, coded in C++,
that simulates and quantifies the effects of policies on cardiometabolic outcomes including
CHD, stroke, and type 2 diabetes, with annual updating of each health state (S1 Text) [28,29].
The model is run at the level of individuals, incorporating the probability of their health transi-
tions according to each person’s risk factors. Based on NHANES as described above, the
model was populated with simulated SNAP participants and their corresponding risk factors
including data on age, sex, systolic blood pressure, total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, BMI,
smoking status, diabetes status, baseline dietary habits, and other characteristics as necessary.
Each individual’s risk was calculated annually, adapted primarily from the Framingham Risk
Score, with calibration and validation to empirical historical disease trends [29] and with
modeled transition health states including disease-free, death, and acute or chronic CHD
events, stroke (cerebrovascular accident), and diabetes. CVD risk factors and subsequent esti-
mated CVD incidence and mortality were extrapolated and updated using age and time trends
from NHANES. At any given time point, a simulated individual could only be in 1 health state,
with the probability of experiencing subsequent events based on individual characteristics and
risk factors. The microsimulation process across each state and transitions are illustrated in
Fig 1.
Model outputs included total and mean estimated outcomes for the simulated population
over a 5-, 10-, and 20-year open cohort analytic period (2018–2038) as well as a closed cohort
lifetime (S1 Text). The specific model outcomes included deaths from CHD or stroke, nonfatal
events including myocardial infarction, stroke, angina, resuscitated cardiac arrest, and type 2
diabetes, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and event-associated healthcare costs (see
below).
Intervention and healthcare costs
Intervention costs were estimated including administrative costs of program implementation,
EBT processing, retail infrastructure, outreach and education, and monitoring and evaluation;
SNAP program subsidy costs for incentivized foods; and SNAP program savings for disincen-
tivized foods (but not restricted foods, which produced no program savings) (S5 Table).
Administrative costs were derived from the HIP report estimates for extending the project
nationally [25]. Because SNAP is an established national program with benefits operationa-
lized through an existing electronic system at retailers that already discriminates products
based on UPCs, retailers were considered unlikely to have any new meaningful costs due to
implementation of the policies. The costs of food incentives and disincentives were calculated
for each food category based on data from the USDA Economic Research Service Quarterly
Food-at-Home Price Database [35], the estimated average national price of SSBs [36], the Con-
sumer Expenditure Survey [37], and the USDA SNAP report [38].
As reported in detail elsewhere [29], direct healthcare costs were derived from various
sources for all acute and chronic disease states, surgical procedures, screening, treatments, and

 side effects (S6 Table). The total annual costs for individuals in each disease state were calcu-
lated using the weighted average of nonfatal and fatal states. The costs associated with chronic
disease states were derived from various studies on costs for each individual disease state. Indi-
rect costs such as lost productivity were conservatively excluded from the analysis.
Cost-effectiveness analysis
In accordance with recommendations from the Second Panel on Cost-Effectiveness in Health
and Medicine [39], we conducted analyses from various perspectives. This included (1) a soci-
etal perspective, incorporating program administrative costs and healthcare costs but not costs
or savings from direct food subsidies or disincentives (which can be considered an intra-socie-
tal cash transfer); (2) a government affordability perspective further incorporating SNAP pro-
gram costs and savings from direct food subsidies and disincentives for all SNAP adults (age
35+ y); and (3) a government affordability perspective further incorporating SNAP program
costs and savings from direct food subsidies and disincentives for all SNAP participants (half
of whom are children, for whom our model estimated only costs, with no health benefits or
healthcare cost-savings). Each government affordability perspective can also be considered as
a modified societal perspective that includes predominantly government healthcare and SNAP
costs, while also adding the considerable government costs of food subsidies—an intra-societal
transfer to the public not typically included in a societal perspective—and also intervention
and health costs borne by other health payers and consumers.
All costs were inflated to constant 2017 US dollars, and all costs and health endpoints dis-
counted annually by 3%. Net costs were calculated as intervention costs minus healthcare cost-
savings from reduced cardiometabolic diseases. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs)
were calculated as the net change in costs divided by the net change in QALYs. Willingness-
to-pay thresholds were evaluated at $150,000 and $50,000 per QALY, consistent with Ameri-
can Heart Association/American College of Cardiology recommendations [40].
Probabilistic sensitivity analyses
To assess the potential impact of uncertainty in key inputs, we performed probabilistic sensi-
tivity analyses jointly incorporating the uncertainty distributions of multiple parameters. This
uncertainty included uncertainty in policy effect sizes, diet–disease relative risks (including
their variation by age), CVD risks, implementation costs, food units costs, formal and informal
healthcare costs, and utility weights (S9 Table). One thousand simulations were run drawing
from the uncertainty distributions of each of these inputs at 5 years and over a lifetime, with
95% uncertainty intervals (UIs) based on the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles of the 1,000
simulations.
Results
Population characteristics and dietary intakes
The mean (SD) age of adult SNAP participants was 52.1 (12.3) years, about half (50.8%) were
white, and more than 1 in 3 participants (35.0%) had some college education or more
(Table 1). Among adults on SNAP, 22.4% were on Medicare, 29.5% on Medicaid, and 41.7%
on either Medicare or Medicaid (with 10.2% on both, i.e., dual-eligible). Considering adults on
Medicare or Medicaid as the denominator, 12.7% of Medicare and 61.1% of Medicaid benefi-
ciaries were also on SNAP.
The current baseline consumption levels and estimated changes in consumption with the
policy interventions are shown in Table 2. The F&V subsidy would increase intakes of fruits by

 19.1 g/d and vegetables by 25.6 g/d. Adding an SSB restriction would lower SSB intake by 139
g/d (4.7 fl oz/d). A combined incentive/disincentive program would have a smaller effect on
SSBs (−1.7 fl oz/d), but would also modestly increase intakes of whole grains, fish, and plant-
based oils and modestly reduce intakes of processed meats and junk food. To place these
changes in perspective as a proportion of the 2015 Dietary Guidelines for Americans recom-
mendations [41] (for a 2,000 kcal/d diet, the following equivalents: fruits, 2 cups/d; vegetables,
2.5 cups/d; nuts, 5 oz/wk; whole grains, 3 oz/d; and fish, 8 oz/wk), the changes in intake with
SNAP-plus would achieve 9.6% of the recommendations for fruits, 11.5% for vegetables, 8.5%
for nuts, 4.0% for whole grains, and 12.1% for fish. Such comparisons were not made for
unhealthy food items like SSBs, where the optimal intake could be considered 0.
Health outcomes
Health gains, healthcare cost-savings, intervention costs, and ICERs are summarized in
Table 3, with results of probabilistic sensitivity analyses in S10 Table. At 5 years, our simulation
estimated that the F&V incentive would prevent 38,782 CVD events, with minimal effects on
diabetes; the F&V incentive/SSB restriction policy would prevent 93,933 CVD events and
30,443 cases of diabetes; and SNAP-plus would prevent 116,875 CVD events and 26,138 cases
of diabetes. Over a lifetime, corresponding values were 303,911, 797,888, and 939,965 CVD
events prevented and −1,077, 171,357, and 146,590 cases of diabetes prevented, with respective
healthcare cost-savings of $6.77 billion, $39.16 billion, and $41.93 billion.
Cost-effectiveness
From a societal perspective, considering both program implementation costs and healthcare
savings, all 3 interventions were cost-saving at 5 years and beyond, with estimated lifetime

 societal savings of $6.69 billion, $39.05 billion, and $41.82 billion, respectively (Table 3; S1
Fig). From a government affordability perspective, incorporating the government costs of pro-
viding food subsidies, the F&V incentive was of low cost-effectiveness at 5 years, with ICERs of
$204,928/QALY for subsidizing SNAP adults and $548,053/QALY for subsidizing all SNAP
participants. However, by 10 years, the F&V incentive achieved traditional cost-effectiveness
(<$150,000/QALY) for subsidizing SNAP adults, and over a lifetime, was very cost-effective
(<$50,000/QALY) for subsidizing SNAP adults and cost-effective (<$150,000/QALY) for sub-
sidizing all SNAP participants.
Adding SSB restriction produced a modest increase in policy administrative costs and (due
to improved survival) increased F&V subsidy costs, but also a 4- to 5-fold increase in health-
care cost-savings (Table 3; S1 Fig). Consequently, from a government affordability perspective,
the intervention was very cost-effective at 5 years and cost-saving at 10+ years for subsidizing
SNAP adults (lifetime savings: $17.17 billion), and cost-effective at 10 years and very cost-
effective at 20+ years, even when subsidizing all SNAP participants (lifetime ICER: $5,216/
QALY).
For the SNAP-plus intervention, even with several more categories of incentivized foods,
the food disincentives funded the incentives, creating a net program food cost-savings, or reve-
nue. From a government affordability perspective, this resulted in a cost-saving intervention at
all time points for subsidizing SNAP adults (lifetime savings: $27.74 billion) and for subsidiz-
ing all SNAP participants (lifetime savings: $63.33 billion). Evaluating costs within SNAP
alone (i.e., ignoring healthcare savings), the SNAP-plus intervention remained cost-saving.
For example, at 5 years, $0.15 billion in administrative costs was offset by 4.93 billion in sav-
ings from the combined food incentives/disincentives.

aOutcomes were evaluated among SNAP participants aged 35–80 years at baseline, corresponding to 14.5 million adults in 2017, followed until death or age 100,
whichever occurred first. Compared to a base case of the current policy, the 3 interventions were (1) a 30% financial incentive for purchases of F&V (F&V incentive), (2)
a 30% F&V incentive plus restriction of SSBs (F&V incentive/SSB restriction), and (3) a broader 30% incentive/disincentive program for multiple foods that preserves
choice (SNAP-plus) including a 30% financial incentive for purchases of F&V, nuts, whole grains, fish, and plant-based oils and a 30% disincentive for purchases of
SSBs, junk food, and processed meats (see S1 Table for food category details and definitions).
bBecause we did not identify probable or convincing evidence of etiologic effects of F&V on type 2 diabetes [1] (see S3 Table), the F&V incentive in the model resulted in
a slightly higher number of cases due to increased overall survival from prevented CVD.
cAll costs were inflated to constant 2017 US dollars using the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ Consumer Price Index [42]. Costs and QALYs were discounted by 3% annually.
Healthcare cost-savings were calculated as averted direct costs from chronic/acute disease states, surgical procedures, screening, and drug use. Food subsidy costs were
evaluated for adult SNAP participants only (N = 14.6 million in 2017) and for all SNAP participants including children and adults aged <35 years (N = 42.1 million in
2017) [7,33].
dICER thresholds were evaluated at $150,000/QALY and $50,000/QALY from 3 perspectives including (1) societal, (2) government affordability including subsidy costs
for SNAP adults aged 35+ years, and (3) government affordability including subsidy costs for all SNAP participants including children and adults aged <35 years. As
appropriate, the societal perspective did not include food subsidy costs or disincentive gains because these represent a transfer (like a tax or tax break) from one segment
of society to another. Additional potential health benefits and healthcare cost-savings from these dietary interventions were conservatively excluded, including potential
benefits for cancer in adults as well as all potential health benefits in children and young adults aged <35 years.

 Stratified and sensitivity analyses
The cost-effectiveness or cost-savings and relative health gains of each intervention were gen-
erally similar across groups stratified by age, sex, race/ethnicity, education, and insurance sta-
tus (Figs 2–4; S8 Table). For example, lifetime ICERs for the F&V incentive ranged from a low
of $50,867/QALY in men to a high of $78,688/QALY in women from a government affordabil-
ity perspective (subsidizing all SNAP participants). Adding SSB restriction substantially low-
ered ICERs in all groups, and produced net cost-savings in young adults (age 35–44 y) and in
men. SNAP-plus was cost-saving in essentially all subgroups and for all perspectives, except
for among college graduates from a government affordability perspective (subsidizing all
SNAP participants), in whom the lifetime ICER was still very cost-effective, at $7,878/QALY.
In probabilistic sensitivity analyses, SNAP-plus was cost-saving both at 5 years and over a
lifetime in 1,000 of 1,000 simulations (100%) from both societal and government affordability
perspectives (Fig 5; S10 Table). The F&V incentive and F&V incentive/SSB restriction policies
were also each cost-saving in 100% of simulations both at 5 years and over a lifetime from the
societal perspective. From a government affordability perspective incorporating food subsidy
costs for all SNAP participants including children and adults aged <35 years, the F&V incen-
tive did not achieve cost-effectiveness (<$150,000/QALY) in any simulation at 5 years, but
achieved cost-effectiveness in 99.9% of simulations over a lifetime, while the F&V incentive/
SSB restriction policy was cost-saving or cost-effective in 44.6% of simulations at 5 years, and
100% over a lifetime.
Additional sensitivity analyses are shown in S7 Table. For the F&V incentive/SSB restriction
policy, altering the assumed proportion of SSB purchases that would shift from SNAP dollars
to other food dollars did not greatly alter the inference on this intervention. Similarly, for
SNAP-plus, assuming a larger shift in purchases of disincentivized foods from SNAP dollars to
other food dollars retained cost-savings at all time points for all perspectives. Removing subsi-
dies in SNAP-plus for fish and plant-based oils, the most costly items, resulted in even larger
cost-savings, with $80.77 billion in lifetime savings from a government affordability perspec-
tive (subsidizing all SNAP participants).
Discussion
Based on our microsimulation model and nationally representative data, a F&V incentive,
F&V incentive with SSB restriction, and combined incentive/disincentive program for multi-
ple foods within SNAP would each generate significant health gains among low-income Amer-
icans. Our simulation estimated that the F&V subsidy would gain about 650,000 QALYs, while
the other interventions would gain about 2.1 and 2.5 million QALYs. All interventions were
cost-saving from a societal perspective, with estimated lifetime societal savings of about $6.7
billion, $39 billion, and $42 billion, respectively. From a government affordability perspective,
all 3 programs met traditional cost-effectiveness thresholds over a lifetime, with superior cost-
effectiveness when SSB restrictions were added to the F&V incentive, and net government
cost-savings with SNAP-plus. Notably, the most conservative government affordability per-
spective incorporated the intervention and food subsidy costs for all SNAP participants,
including children and young adults, while estimating health and healthcare cost benefits only
for adults aged 35 years and older. Because consuming healthier diets at younger ages is likely
to lead to health benefits, the overall health gains and cost-effectiveness or cost-savings of each
intervention are likely to be underestimated.
The current average SNAP benefit is $126 per person per month, or about $4.20 per day
[7]. Disparities in diet by SNAP status persist [12]. In 2015, the USDA launched the SNAP
Food Insecurity Nutrition Incentive grant program, providing up to $31.5 million over 2 years

 for point-of-purchase incentives to increase F&V purchases [43]. Although this represents an
important new commitment to leveraging SNAP for healthier choices and better well-being,
our analysis suggests this amount—less than 50 cents per SNAP participant per year—is a
small fraction of the approximately $2.6 billion/year needed to provide a 30% F&V incentive
to all SNAP participants. In the current era of budget constraints, achieving political consensus
for such an increase may be challenging. Incorporation of the associated health gains and
healthcare cost-savings, as in our analysis, provides new evidence to inform this discussion.
From a societal perspective, such an intervention was estimated to prevent tens of thousands
of CVD events, gain substantial QALYs, and be cost-saving. From a government affordability
perspective, a universal 30% F&V incentive in SNAP became cost-effective long term, although
the shorter-term costs per QALY may not be attractive for resource-constrained decisions on
short-term policy priorities.
Our findings suggest further health gains, cost-savings, and cost-effectiveness of adding SSB
restriction to the F&V incentive in SNAP. While several groups have recommended SSB
restrictions in SNAP [18,20,22,23], others have opposed such a change. In 2015, the bipartisan
National Commission on Hunger recommended removing SSBs from the list of eligible pur-
chases in SNAP [23]. Both the technology and precedent exist for altering product eligibility
(e.g., alcohol and pre-prepared hot foods cannot be purchased in SNAP), and several states
including California, Florida, Missouri, Wisconsin, and Texas have considered pilot programs
to test restriction of SSBs [44]. However, such programs have never yet been federally autho-
rized. SSB manufacturers oppose such a restriction [45], which appears to unfairly single out
one product as compared to candy or other junk food, for example. Some anti-poverty advo-
cates and ethical scholars argue that such a restriction is paternalistic, creating “a public policy
message that poor people require government intervention to manage their food choices
whereas higher-income persons do not” [44]. Our findings provide new data in this regard,
estimating that adding SSB restriction to the F&V incentive would prevent an additional
494,000 CVD events and gain 1.46 million more QALYs among low-income Americans on
SNAP. Government affordability also improved to about $5,000/QALY, superior to many
other federally approved health interventions including drug treatment of hypertension
($20,000/QALY [46]), use of statins for primary prevention ($37,000/QALY [28]), and adding
PCSK9 inhibitors to statins in patients with CVD ($414,000/QALY) or heterozygous familial
hypercholesterolemia ($503,000/QALY) [47].
Our results suggest that a combined food incentive/disincentive program may be most
attractive. The F&V incentive has widespread appeal yet was costly, while SSB restriction pro-
duced additional important health gains and cost-savings but raises political challenges in iso-
lating a single product category and restricting choice. In comparison, the SNAP-plus
program incentivized a broad range of foods, with partial disincentives but not absolute
restrictions on less healthy products, preserving participant choice. The bipartisan National
Commission on Hunger recommended incentivizing F&V, whole grains, high-quality pro-
teins, and other healthful foods in SNAP [23]. Our results indicate that adding disincentives

government affordability including food subsidy costs for SNAP adults only (middle panels), and government
affordability including food subsidy costs for all SNAP participants (bottom panels). Negative costs represent cost
savings. The diagonal solid black lines represent a value of $150,000/QALY, a recommended threshold for assessing
health interventions, with values to the right of the line being cost-effective with an ICER<$150,000/QALY. Note: due
to different minimum and maximum quantities among panel figures, different scales were applied to each figure. F&V,

adjusted life year; SNAP, Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program; SSB, sugar-sweetened beverage.

 greatly augments both the health gains and affordability of such an intervention. Overall, the
SNAP-plus intervention produced the largest gains in health and healthcare savings, and was
cost-saving at all time points from all perspectives. Omitting healthcare savings and consider-
ing SNAP fiscal integrity alone—e.g., such as might be done by the Congressional Budget
Office—the SNAP-plus intervention resulted in net savings of $4.78 billion at 5 years and
$21.19 billion over a lifetime, funds that could be reinvested in SNAP to maintain or expand
overall benefits. Novel online and technology-based financial incentive and education pro-
grams for healthier food purchases are now available for higher-income Americans through
worksite wellness, health insurance, and life insurance programs [32]. Such technologies could
be leveraged to provide SNAP participants with education and combined financial incentives
and disincentives for healthier eating, with evaluation in state pilot programs.
Our investigation has several strengths. We utilized a validated microsimulation model and
national data, increasing confidence in the validity and generalizability of our estimates. We
accounted for proportions of food purchased from SNAP-eligible venues (as opposed to res-
taurants, cafeterias, etc.), proportions of purchases using SNAP versus other food dollars, and
potential shifts in spending between SNAP and other food dollars, each reducing the overall
effect and providing more appropriate and conservative estimates of potential impact. The
potential effects of dietary substitutes and complements were also considered because the
diet–disease etiologic effects (relative risks) for changes in the targeted dietary factors were
based on long-term prospective cohort studies, which implicitly incorporate additional health
effects of the average dietary substitutes and complements across the population. Policy inter-
vention effects were based on trials among SNAP participants or, when these not available,
prospective interventions and studies in general populations. We assessed both shorter- and
longer-term health impacts, costs, and cost-effectiveness, providing a range of results across
different potential time periods of interest.
Potential limitations should be considered. Our model cannot prove the health and cost
impacts of national SNAP interventions. Rather, the estimates provide evidence that can be
considered and incorporated into the design of state waiver programs for evaluation. Although
prior interventions observed little shifting of spending dollars to maximize incentives [33], we
cannot exclude that, over many years, participants might shift more of their spending on disin-
centivized foods to other food dollars, reducing intervention efficacy and cost-effectiveness
over time. Conversely, establishing incentives and disincentives on specific food categories
could also shift long-term knowledge and social norms around food purchases, increasing the
efficacy and cost-effectiveness of the intervention over time. While our estimated etiologic
effects for dietary changes inherently incorporated the average dietary complements and sub-
stitutes in the population, health gains could be augmented by additional intervention compo-
nents aiming to encourage or discourage specific complements and substitutes. Our CVD
risk calculations incorporated differences between people in age, sex, systolic blood pressure,
total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, smoking status, diabetes status, baseline diet, and dietary
changes due to the intervention, but not race/ethnicity. However, the risk factors in our model
capture many of the major determinants (or further correlate with many of the determinants)
that explain racial/ethnic disparities in disease risk, especially when further restricted by
income (SNAP eligibility) as in our analysis. Our comparative effectiveness framework also
minimizes the influence of potential residual heterogeneity in CVD risk, as uncaptured factors
would influence both each intervention scenario and the base case scenario, having relatively
small effects on the incremental comparison. We did not incorporate potential additional ben-
efits of synchronizing use of SNAP-Ed, an existing $400 million/year educational program,
with these financial incentive/disincentive programs. We conservatively excluded indirect

 costs of disease states, such as estimated losses in productivity, which, if included, would make
each of the interventions more cost-effective or cost-saving.
In conclusion, our modeling estimates that leveraging SNAP for improved nutrition
through financial incentives for healthier foods, and disincentives or altered eligibility for
unhealthy foods, would generate significant health gains and healthcare cost-savings.
