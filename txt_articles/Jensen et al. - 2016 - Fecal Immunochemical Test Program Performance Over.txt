Abstract
Background—The fecal immunochemical test (FIT) is a common method for colorectal cancer 
(CRC) screening, yet its acceptability and performance over several rounds of annual testing are 
largely unknown.
Objective—To assess FIT performance characteristics over 4 rounds of annual screening.
Design—Retrospective cohort study.
Setting—Kaiser Permanente Northern and Southern California.
Patients—323 349 health plan members aged 50 to 70 years on their FIT mailing date in 2007 or 
2008 who completed the first round of FIT and were followed for up to 4 screening rounds.
Measurements—Screening participation, FIT positivity (≥20 μg of hemoglobin/g), positive 
predictive values for adenoma and CRC, and FIT sensitivity for detecting CRC obtained from 
Kaiser Permanente electronic databases and cancer registries.
Results—Of the patients invited for screening, 48.2% participated in round 1. Of those who 
remained eligible, 75.3% to 86.1% participated in subsequent rounds. Median follow-up was 4.0 
years, and 32% of round 1 participants crossed over to endoscopy over 4 screening rounds—7.0% 
due to a positive FIT result. The FIT positivity rate (5.0%) and positive predictive values 
(adenoma, 51.5%; CRC, 3.4%) were highest in round 1. Overall, programmatic FIT screening 
detected 80.4% of patients with CRC diagnosed within 1 year of testing, including 84.5% in round 
1 and 73.4% to 78.0% in subsequent rounds.
Limitation—Screening detection, rather than long-term cancer prevention, was evaluated.
Conclusion—Annual FIT screening was associated with high sensitivity for CRC, with high 
adherence to annual follow-up screening among initial participants. The findings indicate that 
annual programmatic FIT screening is feasible and effective for population-level CRC screening.
Primary Funding Source—National Institutes of Health.
Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of cancer death in the United States (1–
3), and screening with fecal occult blood tests (FOBTs) reduces CRC incidence and 
mortality (4–6). In randomized trials (7–11), annual or biennial guaiac-based FOBTs 
reduced CRC incidence by 17% to 20% and CRC mortality by 15% to 33%. Thus, the U.S. 
Preventive Services Task Force (4) and U.S. Multi-Society Task Force on Colorectal Cancer 
(12) recommend annual FOBT as an option for CRC screening for average-risk patients, 
defined as those aged 50 to 75 years with no history of CRC or adenoma, with no first-
degree relatives with CRC, and who are not up to date with CRC screening according to 
other methods (that is, sigmoidoscopy within 5 years or colonoscopy within 10 years). 
Annual highly sensitive FOBTs are believed to be as effective as screening colonoscopy 
performed every 10 years if levels of adherence are high (13), although colonoscopy is 
recommended for those with a family history of CRC.

 Fecal blood tests are noninvasive and can be delivered by mail (14). In contrast to guaiac-
based stool tests, fecal immunochemical test (FIT) screening can be done without dietary or 
medication restrictions, which allows it to achieve higher patient acceptance in organized 
CRC screening programs (15). This test also has higher detection rates for CRC and 
advanced adenomas than guaiac-based stool tests (15–17).
In a recent meta-analysis (18), the sensitivity of a single FIT application was 79% for CRC 
diagnosed within 2 years of testing; however, little is known about performance 
characteristics over several rounds of annual screening, particularly in community practice. 
The present study was conducted to evaluate FIT sensitivity for CRC and other performance 
characteristics over 4 rounds of annual testing in a U.S. community-based CRC screening 
program.
Methods
Study Population
This retrospective longitudinal study was performed in a fixed cohort of Kaiser Permanente 
Northern California (KPNC) and Southern California (KPSC) health plan members. These 
integrated health care delivery organizations serve approximately 7 million persons in urban, 
suburban, and semirural regions throughout California. Kaiser Permanente health plan 
membership in California is diverse and similar in socioeconomic characteristics to the 
region’s census demographics (19–21).
Study Oversight
The study was approved by the institutional review boards of KPNC and KPSC, both of 
which waived the requirement for informed consent. The listed authors had sole 
responsibility for the study design, data collection, decision to submit the manuscript for 
publication, and drafting of the manuscript. This study was conducted within the National 
Cancer Institute–funded Population-based Research Optimizing Screening through 
Personalized Regimens (PROSPR) consortium, which conducts multisite, coordinated, 
transdisciplinary research to evaluate and improve cancer-screening processes.
Organized CRC Screening Program
The KPNC and KPSC initiated similar organized FIT screening programs between 2006 and 
2008; the KPNC program has been described previously (14). Briefly, each year, the 
programs mail a FIT kit to eligible health plan members aged 50 to 75 years without a 
record of a colonoscopy within 10 years, sigmoidoscopy within 5 years, or fecal blood test 
within the prior year. The kit includes the FIT (OC FIT-CHEK; Polymedco), a standardized 
letter from the patient’s primary care provider, directions for completing and mailing the 
test, and a preprinted laboratory requisition order form. Outreach includes in-person, mail, 
secure e-mail, and telephone reminders as needed. The kits are returned by mail to regional 
laboratories and analyzed on or shortly after the return date using an OC-Sensor Diana 
automated system (Polymedco) with a cutoff level of 20 μg of hemoglobin/g of buffer for a 
positive result. Patients with a positive FIT result are referred for follow-up colonoscopy.

 Study Eligibility Criteria and Participant Tracking
The study cohort included CRC screening program participants aged 50 to 70 years on the 
date an initial kit was mailed to them in 2007 or 2008. Patients were excluded if they had 
been enrolled in the health plan for less than 1 year before the round 1 FIT mail date (to 
allow for the recording of prior out-of-system endoscopy procedures). They were also 
excluded if they were mailed a kit but subsequently had sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy, 
were diagnosed with CRC, died, or terminated membership in the health plan before 
returning the initial FIT or within 1 year after their round 1 mail date if no FIT was returned. 
A total of 670 841 health plan members was mailed the initial kit in 2007 or 2008 and met 
the study eligibility criteria; 323 349 (48.2%) returned a FIT within 1 year after the mail date 
(Figure). The analytic cohort comprised these round 1 participants who were tracked from 
their baseline mail date (cohort entry) through up to 4 rounds of testing for mail dates; result 
dates; results (positive or negative); whether follow-up colonoscopy was performed within 1 
year after a positive FIT result; and diagnoses of adenoma, adenoma with advanced 
histology, and CRC. Cohort members were followed for CRC through the follow-up 
screening rounds, even if they subsequently became ineligible for screening because of 
sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy. Patients were censored at the time of CRC diagnosis, death, 
or termination of membership in the health plan if they did not rejoin.
Defining Annual Screening Episodes
For each patient, the initial kit mail date in 2007 or 2008 was the anchor date for round 1 and 
for each subsequent round of testing. However, because subsequent mailing dates varied 
each round, mail dates within 3 months before to 12 months after each subsequent round’s 
anchor date were counted as having been distributed during that specific round. For 
example, a patient with a round 1 mail date of 15 March 2007 had subsequent anchor dates 
of 15 March for rounds 2 through 4 (2008, 2009, and 2010, respectively). If their next FIT 
was mailed on 15 January 2008, the test was considered to be distributed in round 2 because 
the second mail date occurred within 3 months of the round 2 anchor date.
The FIT results recorded within 1 year of each mail date, and colonoscopies performed and 
adenomas or CRC diagnosed within 1 year after FIT results, were considered part of a single 
screening episode for the round when the FIT was distributed. Among round 1 participants, 
FITs with no recorded mail dates returned in rounds 2 through 4 were assumed to be 
distributed through in-reach methods (such as a clinic visit) and were counted in the follow-
up round returned. In general, the first result per patient was counted in any given round.
The earliest possible date of cohort entry (first mail date) was 1 January 2007, and the last 
possible date of follow-up was 31 December 2013 (12 months after the last possible FIT 
result date of 31 December 2012).
Data Sources
The FIT-related dates and results were obtained from the CRC screening program and 
laboratory databases for each region, respectively. Endoscopy procedures were identified 
using Current Procedural Terminology codes (22). Adenoma diagnoses used Systematized 
Nomenclature of Medicine codes. Prior validation studies have confirmed high levels of

 sensitivity and accuracy for capture of colonoscopy examinations and assignment of 
adenoma status (23).
Colorectal adenocarcinomas and disease stage were obtained from the KPNC and KPSC 
cancer registries, which report to the SEER (Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results) 
registry. Cancer databases capture more than 98% of cancer diagnoses within the KPNC and 
KPSC populations. Advanced-stage cancer was defined as stage III (regional disease with 
spread to regional lymph nodes only) or stage IV (distant metastasis) according to the 
American Joint Committee on Cancer staging system; for patients who did not have such 
staging, advanced-stage cancer was defined as code 3 (disease in the regional lymph nodes), 
code 4 (regional disease with direct extension and spread to regional lymph nodes), or code 
7 (distant metastasis) according to the SEER Program Coding and Staging Manual 2013 
(24).
Data Analysis
The following performance characteristics were calculated for each round of screening and 
overall: 1) participation (percentage of eligible patients who were distributed and completed 
a FIT within 1 year of their mailing date), 2) FIT positivity (percentage of participants who 
completed FITs and had positive results), 3) follow-up colonoscopy (percentage of 
participants with a positive FIT result who received follow-up colonoscopy within 1 year 
after their result date), 4) positive predictive values (PPVs) for adenoma and advanced 
adenoma (among participants with a positive FIT result receiving follow-up colonoscopy 
within 1 year after their result, the percentage of those in whom an adenoma or advanced 
adenoma [that is, with villous or tubulovillous histology] were diagnosed), and 5) PPV for 
CRC (percentage of participants with a positive FIT result who had CRC diagnosed within 1 
year after their result date).
In addition, FIT sensitivity for CRC was evaluated in 3 ways: by screening round (the 
percentage of patients with CRC who received positive FIT results in the year before 
diagnosis), number of rounds of participation (stratified by the total number of rounds of 
participation per patient), and look-back period (the percentage of patients with CRC and 
positive FIT results looking back up to 4 years before diagnosis). This analysis was also 
stratified by colon location. Proximal cancer was defined as cancer located in the cecum, 
ascending colon, hepatic flexure, or transverse colon; distal cancer was defined as cancer in 
the splenic flexure, descending colon, sigmoid colon, or rectum.
Performance measures were stratified by sex, age (50 to 64 years and ≥65 years), and region 
(KPNC and KPSC). We also examined the frequency of advanced-stage CRC at diagnosis 
by FIT status in the prior year (positive, negative, or unscreened) among all patients with 
CRC. Analyses used SAS, version 9.3 (SAS Institute), and Stata, version 10.1 (StataCorp).
Role of the Funding Source
The study was funded by the National Institutes of Health, which had no role in the 
conception, design, analysis, or conduct of the study.

 Results
Participation and Patient Characteristics
A total of 670 841 patients meeting the study eligibility criteria was mailed the test kit in 
2007 or 2008, and 323 349 (48.2%) completed the test within 1 year of the mail date 
(Figure). Round 1 participants had a mean age of 58.5 years (SD, 5.7), 46.4% were men, and 
55.4% were white (Table 1). Median follow-up was 4.0 years (1 180 816 person-years). A 
total of 32.0% of round 1 participants crossed over to endoscopy during the 3 subsequent 
rounds of screening, including 7.0% because of a positive FIT result (Figure). Of the 
participants who remained eligible for screening and were distributed subsequent kits, 
participation was 75.3%, 83.4%, and 86.1% in rounds 2 through 4, respectively (Table 2). 
Across all screening rounds, 63.8% of distributed tests were completed within 1 year of 
mailing. Participation was higher at KPNC than KPSC (67.2% vs. 59.8%) (Table 2) and in 
older (≥65 years) than younger (50 to 64 years) patients (77.5% vs. 60.3%) (Appendix 
Table, available at www.annals.org).
FIT Positivity and Receipt of Follow-up Colonoscopy
In the first round, 5.0% of test results were positive; positivity estimates were lower in 
subsequent rounds (3.7% to 4.3%) (Table 2). The FIT positivity rate was higher at KPSC 
than KPNC (4.7% vs. 4.1%) (Table 2), in men versus women (5.1% vs. 3.7%), and in older 
versus younger patients (5.2% vs. 4.1%) (Appendix Table).
Overall, 78.4% of participants with positive FIT results had follow-up colonoscopy within 1 
year of their test result, and estimates were similar by region (Table 2). The median time 
from result date to follow-up colonoscopy was 45 days. More than 96% of participants had 
some degree of follow-up within 12 months of their positive result: colonoscopy (78.4%), 
sigmoidoscopy (2.1%), gastroenterology consultation (5.4%), or primary care visit (10.7%).
Adenoma and CRC PPVs
Adenoma predictive value estimates were available for KPNC only. The PPVs for adenoma 
were highest in round 1 (51.5%) and were lower but stable in subsequent rounds (47.4% to 
48.5%) (Table 2). Values were higher in men than women (55.5% vs. 42.2%) and in older 
than younger patients (52.7% vs. 48.2%) (Appendix Table). A similar pattern across rounds 
was seen for adenomas with advanced histology, and the overall value was higher for men 
than women. The PPVs for CRC were also highest in the first round (3.4%); estimates were 
lower but stable in subsequent rounds (2.1% to 2.3%), and estimates were similar by sex or 
age.
FIT Sensitivity for CRC and Distribution of Cancer, by FIT Screening Status
By screening round (Table 3), the FIT sensitivity for CRC was highest in the first round 
(84.5%); estimates were lower but stable in subsequent rounds (73.4% to 78.0%). The 
pattern was similar when sensitivity was evaluated by the total number of rounds of 
participation per patient (Table 3).

 With look-back intervals of up to 1, 2, 3, and 4 years from CRC diagnosis to FIT screening 
for all patients with CRC (Table 3), 79.7%, 76.3%, 75.4%, and 75.3% of such patients had 
positive results beforehand, respectively. Sensitivity estimates were somewhat lower for 
proximal cancer (72.9% [360 of 494 patients]) than distal cancer (77.0% [690 of 896 
patients]); 21 patients had cancer in an unknown location.
Finally, patients with positive FIT results in the prior year had advanced-stage CRC less 
often (26.9% [262 of 974 patients]) than those who were not screened in the prior year 
(37.1% [72 of 194 patients]) and those with CRC who had negative FIT results in the prior 
year (33.1% [80 of 242 patients]); 1 had unknown-stage CRC.
Discussion
Our findings of lower but stable FIT performance characteristics after the first round of 
testing, high adherence to repeated rounds of FIT screening, and high levels of abnormal 
colonoscopy examination results after a positive FIT result have implications for CRC 
screening programs and provide population-level estimates for colonoscopy quality metrics 
and CRC screening studies.
For organized FIT screening programs to be effective, patients need to participate. 
Participation estimates from 50% to 63% have been reported for up to 6 rounds of biennial 
FITs (25, 26) and FOBTs (27, 28) in European populations. In randomized trials comparing 
colonoscopy with FIT screening, participation was higher for FIT than colonoscopy (29–31). 
In our study, 670 841 patients were mailed a kit in round 1 and 48.2% completed FIT 
screening within 1 year of the mailing date. Of those who completed the initial FIT and 
remained eligible, adherence to annual screening was high and reached 86.1% in round 4. 
These findings suggest that annual screening may be feasible for populations in similar 
settings.
Effective CRC screening requires follow-up colonoscopy after a positive FIT result. About 
78% of participants received colonoscopy within 1 year after a positive result, with a median 
time of 45 days. Relatively few participants were lost to follow-up because nearly 97% had 
lower-bowel endoscopy, gastroenterology consultation, or primary care provider visit within 
1 year of their positive test result. Investigating factors associated with failure to receive a 
follow-up may inform efforts to increase CRC screening adherence and avoid inappropriate 
screening among persons who decline or cannot complete subsequent testing.
The FIT positivity rates and PPVs for adenomas, adenomas with advanced histology, and 
CRC were highest in round 1 of screening and were lower but relatively stable in subsequent 
rounds (Appendix Figure, available at www.annals.org). This pattern is consistent with more 
prevalent cases of adenoma and CRC in the initial round of screening and more incident 
cases in subsequent rounds. A similar trend has been reported in previous FOBT trials with 
biennial testing of 3 to 6 rounds (7, 27, 28). The FIT positivity estimates observed in the 
current study (3.7% to 5.0%) are similar to estimates reported over 4 rounds of biennial FIT 
screening in a small cohort of 2959 patients in Italy (3.7% to 4.4%) (25) and over 2 rounds 
of biennial testing in a larger Italian cohort (5.8 to 6.2%) (26). The PPVs in our study ranged

Author Manuscript
 from 2.1% to 3.4% for CRC and 47.4% to 51.5% for adenoma, with the highest values for 
each observed in round 1. Our adenoma values are higher than those of the Italian cohort, 
which ranged from 36.6% to 37.7% (26). The stable FIT positivity rates and predictive value 
estimates in subsequent rounds, if sustained, suggest that regular FIT screening may offer 
protection against death from interval adenomas and CRC that develop after starting a 
screening program.
Our PPV estimates for adenomas and adenomas with advanced histology may help to inform 
colonoscopy quality guidelines. Professional societies recommend tracking physician 
adenoma detection rates for screening colonoscopy examinations as a quality metric (32), 
and target detection rates were recently increased to 20% or more for women and 30% or 
more for men (33). At present, there are no formal target adenoma detection rates for 
colonoscopy examinations after a positive FIT result. In the present study, we observed an 
adenoma detection rate of approximately 50% in such patients, including 42% for women 
and nearly 56% for men. These population-level estimates, if replicated, may inform 
guidelines about minimum rates of adenoma detection in those receiving colonoscopy after a 
positive FIT result.
For a screening test to be effective, it must reliably detect cancer. A recent meta-analysis of 
19 FIT studies reported a pooled sensitivity for CRC of 79% (95% CI, 69% to 86%) for a 
single FIT application (18). In our study, the FIT sensitivity for CRC was highest (84.5%) in 
the first screening round, which is consistent with the detection of more prevalent cancer. In 
subsequent rounds, sensitivity estimates declined to a more steady state (range in sensitivity, 
73.4% to 78.0%), which is consistent with the prior removal of most patients with prevalent 
cancer from the screened population and the ongoing detection of incident (new) cancer. The 
pattern was similar when evaluated by the total number of rounds of participation per 
patient. In addition, when looking back up to 4 years between the cancer diagnosis and FIT 
screening, we found that sensitivity did not change substantially with a longer follow-up 
after screening. Thus, patients must be advised that annual FIT screening is important—the 
first screening detects about 85% of patients with CRC, and each subsequent year of testing 
detects an additional 75% of cancer cases in the population (primarily incident cancer). 
Cancer detected by positive FIT results was also diagnosed at an earlier stage than cancer 
not screened by FIT the year before diagnosis and cancer that had negative results in the 
previous year. The former finding aligns with expectations about cancer progression, but the 
latter may be due to chance or because cancer missed by FIT screening the previous year 
may have a different biology. Finally, sensitivity was somewhat lower for proximal than 
distal cancer. Overall, our findings, similar to those of randomized trials of efficacy, suggest 
that FIT screening can be effective in large community-based settings.
To our knowledge, the current study is the largest evaluation of FIT performance to date. 
Strengths include a comprehensive capture of FIT outreach and test results in a large, 
diverse, community-based population with urban, semirural, and rural areas; validated and 
comprehensive approaches for capturing pathology data and follow-up diagnostic 
colonoscopy examinations; histologic confirmation of adenomas; comprehensive capture of 
patients with CRC and disease stage through SEER-affiliated cancer registries; up to 4 
rounds of annual testing; and many patients with CRC. Potential limitations include that the

 population screened by FIT may differ from the population screened by other methods, and 
the study does not compare FIT outreach to usual care or other screening methods. 
Censoring patients at the termination of health plan membership may have led to the 
underascertainment of CRC. Sensitivity calculations used longitudinal follow-up limited to 
up to 4 years rather than colonoscopy for all patients, including those with negative FIT 
results; as a result, long-term cancer prevention from polyp removal and possibly the 
underdetection of CRC could not be assessed. However, FIT sensitivity for CRC did not 
change substantially with longer follow-up: 80.0% of those with cancer had positive FIT 
results within 1 year of follow-up, whereas the capture of additional CRC diagnoses with 
longer follow-ups of 2 and 4 years only decreased sensitivity to 77.3% and 76.9%, 
respectively.
In conclusion, in a large community-based cohort that was offered annual FIT screening, the 
test’s positivity, predictive values, and sensitivity declined slightly after the first round but 
then remained relatively steady. Among persons starting screening, subsequent participation 
was high (>75% annually) over 3 additional rounds of testing. About 80% of patients 
diagnosed with CRC over 4 rounds of testing were detected by screening within the year 
before diagnosis. These findings suggest high FIT sensitivity for CRC over several rounds of 
testing, inform colonoscopy quality metrics for adenoma detection in patients with positive 
FIT results, and indicate that annual programmatic FIT screening is both feasible and 
effective for CRC screening in a large community-based setting.

 EDITORS’ NOTES
Context
The fecal immunochemical test is an effective way to screen for colorectal cancer, but we 
know more about how well it does the first time it is used and less about how well it does 
in later years with repeated testing.
Contribution
The researchers show that, after 4 years of repeated testing, patients continued to use the 
test and it continued to identify colorectal cancer.
Caution
This study did not measure whether identification of cancer changed outcomes.
Implication
The fecal immunochemical test is acceptable and effective for repeated testing.

 Figure. Study flow diagram.*
The figure includes 1192 patients with CRC who were screened by FIT the year before 
diagnosis. Further, there were 118 additional patients with CRC diagnosed more than 1 y 
beyond the FIT screening date and 101 additional patients diagnosed with CRC who either 
crossed over to endoscopy in subsequent rounds or terminated health plan membership but 
then rejoined. CRC = colorectal cancer; FIT = fecal immunochemical test.
*Shading indicates where patients were censored or became ineligible for subsequent FIT 
screening.
