Abstract
Rationale: Asthma is a chronic disease that affects quality of life,
productivity at work and school, and healthcare use; and it can result
in death. Measuring the current economic burden ofasthma provides
important information on the impact of asthma on society. This
information can be used to make informed decisions about allocation
of limited public health resources.
Objectives: In this paper, we provide a comprehensive approach to
estimating the current prevalence, medical costs, cost of absenteeism
(missed work and school days), and mortality attributable to asthma
from a national perspective. In addition, we estimate the association of
the incremental medical cost of asthma with several important factors,
including race/ethnicity, education, poverty, and insurance status.
Methods: The primary source of data was the 2008–2013 household
component of the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey. We defined
treatedasthmaas thepresenceofatleastonemedicalorpharmaceutical
encounter or claim associated with asthma. For the main analysis,
we applied two-part regression models to estimate asthma-related
annual per-person incremental medical costs and negative binomial
models to estimate absenteeism associated with asthma.
Results: Of 213,994 people in the pooled sample, 10,237 persons
had treated asthma (prevalence, 4.8%). The annual per-person
incremental medical cost of asthma was $3,266 (in 2015 U.S.
dollars), of which $1,830 was attributable to prescription medication,
$640 to office visits, $529 to hospitalizations, $176 to hospital-
based outpatient visits, and $105 to emergency room visits. For
certain groups, the per-person incremental medical cost of
asthma differed from that of the population average, namely $2,145
for uninsured persons and $3,581 for those living below the
poverty line. During 2008–2013, asthma was responsible for
$3 billion in losses due to missed work and school days, $29 billion
due to asthma-related mortality, and $50.3 billion in medical
costs. All combined, the total cost of asthma in the United
States based on the pooled sample amounted to $81.9 billion
in 2013.
Conclusions: Asthma places a significant economic
burden on the United States, with a total cost of asthma,
including costs incurred by absenteeism and mortality, of
$81.9 billion in 2013.

 Asthma is a chronic disease of the airways
characterized by periods of reversible
airflow obstruction resulting in symptoms of
cough, wheeze, chest tightness, and dyspnea.
In 2013, approximately 22.6 million people
in the United States (7.3% of the population)
had current asthma, including 6.1 million
children (aged ,18 yr) and 16.5 million
adults (1). Asthma negatively affects quality
of life, productivity at work and school, and
healthcare use, and it can even result in
death.
Asthma places a significant economic
burden on the United States (2–6). The cost
of asthma is a measure of the economic
burden of the disease and represents the
additional costs imposed by having asthma.
Cost studies can influence public health
policy decisions and help decision makers
understand the scale, seriousness, and
implications of the disease so that resources
can be identified to improve asthma
management and reduce the burden of
asthma (7, 8). Reports on the cost of asthma
present disease burden in monetary terms
and allow reasonable comparison of the
population effects of different chronic
conditions (9–11).
Multiple studies on the cost of asthma
in the United States (4–6, 12–16) have
demonstrated that costs are affected by
numerous factors, including new treatment
options, federal and state policies, changes
in price and the healthcare market, and
increasing effectiveness of asthma control
programs (1). Dissemination of the medical
and economic burden of asthma can inform
decisions about allocation of public health
resources.
The first comprehensive study of
asthma economic burden estimated the cost
to society at $6.2 billion (1990 U.S. dollars)
in 1990, including direct medical costs and
productivity losses due to morbidity and
mortality (16). The authors of that study
used a gross-costing method that was based
on healthcare use and average per-unit cost
data (17–22). The cost of asthma-related
hospitalizations, for example, was estimated
by multiplying the number of asthma
hospitalizations by the average cost for one
hospitalization (7, 23).
Lately, in cost-of-illness studies, it is
increasingly common to use regression
models to isolate the effect of diseases on
healthcare costs (24, 25). In 2009, Kamble
and Bharmal used generalized linear
regression models (GLMs) to estimate the
cost of asthma using data from the 2004
Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS)
(26). Those authors found that the per-
person incremental medical costs of asthma
(additional cost associated with having
asthma) were $2,078 for adults and $1,005
for children, amounting to an estimated
$37.2 billion (2007 U.S. dollars) in total
medical cost associated with asthma. Using

Nurmagambetov, Kuwahara, and Garbe: Cost of Asthma in the United States
349
 2003 and 2005 MEPS data, Sullivan and
colleagues found that adults with asthma
incurred $1,907 (2008 U.S. dollars)
annually in incremental medical costs (27).
In 2011, Barnett and Nurmagambetov
estimated the per-person incremental
medical cost of asthma at $3,856 (2009 U.S.
dollars) and the total national cost of
asthma at $56 billion (4).
The objective of the present study was
to provide current estimates of medical,
absenteeism, and mortality costs of treated
asthma at both the individual and national
levels for the years 2008–2013. For the
purposes of this paper, we define treated
asthma as having had at least one medical
or pharmaceutical encounter or claim
associated with asthma. Our estimates also
include the prevalence of treated asthma,
per-person cost, and total cost of treated
asthma in the United States. In addition,
we examined the effects of several
demographic and socioeconomic factors on
asthma medical costs, including income,
education, age, race/ethnicity, and
insurance status.
Methods
MEPS
We used data derived from MEPS for
calendar years 2008–2013 (28). The survey
sample of households for each year was
drawn from among respondents in the
previous year’s National Health Interview
Survey, a nationally representative sample
of the U.S. civilian noninstitutionalized
population (29). MEPS collects detailed
information on healthcare use,
expenditures, payment source, and health
insurance coverage. Cosponsored by the
Agency for Healthcare Research and
Quality and the National Center for Health
Statistics, MEPS uses a complex survey
design and provides population weights to
create nationally representative estimates
for the U.S. population.
The MEPS household component
contains detailed self-reported information
on demographics, socioeconomic status,
health conditions, insurance status,
healthcare use and expenditures,
employment, missed work, and missed
school. MEPS data cover expenditures for
office-based provider visits, hospital-based
outpatient visits, inpatient hospitalizations,
emergency room (ER) visits, prescription
medications, home health care, dental
services, and vision aids. The MEPS
medical provider component is a follow-
up survey covering a sample of
pharmacies and healthcare providers.
The full 2008–2013 MEPS sample
ranged from 32,846 to 38,974 persons
annually, and the response rate ranged
from 53.5 to 59.3%.
Study Samples
We merged data from the MEPS
household component full-year
consolidated data files with household
component event files. Event files
included data on office-based physician
visits, hospital-based outpatient and
special clinic visits, ER visits, hospital
inpatient stays, and prescription
medications. To eliminate missing
information and to improve accuracy,
MEPS collects additional information
from a sample of medical providers and
applies a specific imputation procedure
for any remaining missing values (28).
Using unique identification variables,
we created a merged file of person-level
data for each of the years during 2008–
2013. Pooled data files from these 6
years provided a total sample size of
213,994 persons. To address the
complex survey design of MEPS, we
used person-level weights and survey
commands in the Stata 12 software
program for the analysis (30). For the
remainder of this paper, all monetary
values are adjusted to 2015 U.S. dollars
using the Consumer Price Index and the
medical care Consumer Price Index
(31). We applied the Stata twopm
program to run two-part regression
models (TPRMs) (32).
Case Definition of Asthma
In our analysis, we used the following
definitions. Treated asthma was defined
as International Classification of
Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical
Modification, diagnosis code 493
(asthma) associated with an office-based
medical provider office visit, hospital-
based outpatient visit, ER visit, hospital
inpatient stay, or filled prescription
medication for asthma. Lifetime asthma
was defined as an affirmative response to
the question, “Has a doctor or other
health professional ever told you that
you had asthma?” Current asthma was
defined as having lifetime asthma plus
an affirmative response to the question,

 “Do you still have asthma?” By these
definitions, a person with treated asthma
also has current asthma, and a person with
current asthma also has lifetime asthma.
For the remainder of this paper, asthma
refers to treated asthma unless otherwise
specified. Given that we used expenditure
data to measure medical cost, treated
asthma is the term most relevant to the
discussion.
Dependent Variables
For our analysis, we used annual per-person
total healthcare expenditure (or medical
cost) and separate annual per-person
expenditures for office visits, hospital
outpatient visits, ER visits, hospital
admissions, and prescription medications.
MEPS defines per-person expenditure as the
sum of all direct payments by all payers for
care during the year, including out-of-
pocket payments, payments by all public
and private insurances, and other sources.
Given the high proportion of zero values
found in annual per-person expenditure
data, reflecting the frequency of persons
having no healthcare expenditures during
the year, we used a binary dependent
variable that identified persons with a
positive healthcare expenditure. We also
used two additional dependent variables,
missed workdays and school days, to
estimate the effect of asthma on
absenteeism.
Independent Variables
The main independent variable for the
analysis was a binary variable in which 1
indicated that a person had asthma and 0 if
not. Sex, age, age squared, race/ethnicity,
education, marital status, income level,
health insurance, U.S. Census region, and
the D’Hoore adaptation of the Charlson
comorbidity index were also included (33).
Enrollment in a healthcare insurance plan
meant continuous enrollment throughout
the year; uninsured meant uninsured for
the entire year.
Incremental Medical Cost of Asthma
To estimate the incremental medical costs of
asthma and related absenteeism during
2008–2013, we applied regression-based
techniques that take into account
distribution of medical costs and missed
workdays and school days. We used a
TPRM to estimate the per-person annual
incremental medical cost of asthma. The
model produces the incremental cost of
asthma or the difference between predicted
annual medical expenditure of the person
with asthma (the value of the variable for
asthma equal to 1) and the predicted
annual medical expenditure of the same
person, assuming that person does not have
asthma (changing the value from 1 to 0).
Using a TPRM allowed us to isolate the
effect of asthma on medical cost while
controlling for the presence of other factors.
In the first part of the TPRM, we used
logistic regression to predict the probability
of any positive healthcare expenditure. In
the second part, we estimated actual
expenditure conditional on having a
nonzero expenditure during the year. In
both parts, we used the same set of
independent variables. To select the
appropriate model for the second part of the
TPRM, we used criteria recommended by

 Manning and Mullahy (25). On the basis of
their algorithm, in the second stage, we
used a GLM with a gamma distribution and
a log link to estimate per-person annual
medical expenditures for all persons who
had a nonzero expenditure. The TPRM
generates a prediction function for per-
person total medical cost, then the Stata 12
marginal effect command, applied to the
asthma variable, estimates the incremental
medical cost of asthma. Incremental costs
of prescription medications, office-based
visits, hospital-based visits, ER visits, and
hospitalizations were similarly obtained.
Absenteeism Cost
For analysis of missed workdays and school
days, we used a negative binomial model
with the same independent variables used to
calculate incremental medical cost. We
produced two predicted values for missed
days: one for persons with asthma and one
for the same persons without asthma by
simulating the removal of asthma. The
difference between these two predicted
values was the expected incremental
workdays or school days lost owing to
asthma.
To estimate the cost of missed
workdays or school days, we used a human
capital approach whereby the cost of one
missed workday was equivalent to a lost
daily wage (34, 35). Daily wage was
estimated using actual or imputed number
of hours worked per week and hourly wage.
To assign the value to the missed school
day, we assumed that one parent missed
work to care for the child, so the value was
equivalent to the day’s lost wage. For a two-
parent household, we assumed the lower-
earning or nonworking parent would stay
home, and for the latter, the value of the
missed day was based on the national
minimum wage.
Mortality Cost
For mortality data, we used the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention’s CDC
WONDER (Wide-ranging Online Data for
Epidemiologic Research) web application,
extracting cases with asthma as the
underlying cause of death for years 2008–
2013 (36). To assess the value of mortality,
we used the value of statistical life (VSL)
approach (37).
Results
Of 213,994 people in the pooled sample,
10,237 persons (4.8%) had asthma (Table 1).
During 2008–2013, the annual sample size
ranged from 32,846 in 2010 to 38,974 in
2012, with prevalence ranging from 4.6%
in 2012 to 4.9% in 2013. The average age in
both groups was the same; however, the
population with asthma had a larger
proportion of children aged 5–14 years.
Women and black individuals were
more likely to have asthma. Married adults
were less likely to have asthma. Among
people with asthma, a larger proportion
lived in poverty (,100% of the poverty line)
or near the poverty line (from 100 to 125%
of the poverty line). Persons with asthma
had a significantly higher Charlson
comorbidity index than did persons
without asthma.
The proportion of persons covered by
Medicaid was significantly higher in the
asthma group (33%) than in the nonasthma
group (17%). A smaller proportion of the
asthma group (6%) was uninsured than in
the nonasthma group (18%). Persons with
asthma were also generally less educated and
had lower incomes than their counterparts
without asthma.
On average, the total unadjusted
medical cost of people with asthma was
more than twice that of people without
asthma; this was also true for the remaining
five categories of healthcare expenditure. On
average, children and adults with asthma
also missed significantly more days of school

include more details on the methods and
results for the annual estimates, variances,
and confidence intervals in the online
supplement.
Incremental Cost of Asthma
Table 2 shows the results of the TPRM for
six major medical expenditure categories
for each year during 2008–2013 and for the
pooled sample. The total annual per-person
incremental medical cost of asthma for the
pooled sample was $3,266, comprising
expenditure for prescription medications of
$1,830; office-based visits, $640; hospital-
based outpatient visits, $176; ER visits,
$105; and inpatient hospital admissions,
$529. All point estimates were significant at
the 95% confidence level. The results
derived from the TPRM and the marginal
effect analysis can also be applied to specific
subpopulations of interest identified by the
independent variables. For example, those
living below the poverty line incur
significantly higher incremental medical
cost of asthma than those with higher
income (Figure 1). Compared with $3,266
for the entire population, the average
medical cost for women was $3,322; for
children (aged ,18 yr), $1,737; for black
individuals, $3,145; for Hispanic
individuals, $2,905; for high school
graduates, $3,424; for the Medicaid
population, $3,453; and for the uninsured,
$2,145 (Table 3).
Prevalence of Asthma and Total
Medical Cost of Asthma
During 2008–2013, the annual asthma
prevalence was almost 5.0%, with the annual
total medical cost nearly $50.3 billion based
on the pooled sample. The prevalence of
asthma in the United States ranged from 4.8%
in 2008 and 2009 to 5.2% in 2011, and the
total medical costs ranged from $39.3 billion
in 2008 to $67.5 billion in 2012 (Table 4).
Absenteeism and Mortality Cost
Attributable to Asthma
Table 5 shows results of the negative
binomial regression model for incremental
days lost owing to asthma based on the
pooled sample. Asthma was responsible for
an additional 1.8 missed workdays and 2.3
missed school days per person per year.
Nationally, over 8.7 million workdays and
over 5.2 million school days were lost
owing to asthma, amounting to a total loss
of $3 billion. During 2008–2013, asthma
caused, on average, 3,168 deaths, costing
$29.0 billion per year (Table 6).
Total Cost of Asthma
To estimate the total economic impact of
asthma on society, we combined medical,
absenteeism, and mortality costs (Table 7).
The total cost of asthma for the pooled
sample was $81.9 billion.
Discussion
Our analysis underscores the serious and
substantial economic burden of asthma on
society. On the basis of the 2008–2013
pooled sample, annual per-person medical
costs attributable to asthma were $3,266,
and annual per-person expenditures for
prescription medications exceeded the
amount spent by persons without asthma
by more than $1,800, amounting to 56% of
total medical expenditures (Table 2).
Recent studies support this finding (4, 27,
38, 39). The proportion of the combined
expenditure for prescription medications
and office-based visits exceeded 75%,
compared with 19.4% for asthma-related
(ER) visits and hospital admissions, which
is also consistent with recent studies (4, 38).
Children with asthma missed 2.3
additional school days annually during
2008–2013 at a per-child cost of $207,
notwithstanding loss of quality of life. This
is consistent with other studies (4, 38, 40,
41). For adults, on average, asthma caused
1.8 days of missed work, resulting in almost
$214 lost earnings per worker annually,
which is consistent with previous studies
(4, 27, 40). Our estimates of missed
workdays and school days were also
comparable with findings by both Wang
and colleagues (41) and Sullivan and
colleagues (27), respectively. Our mortality
costs of asthma using the VSL method were
higher than those reported by Barnett and
Nurmagambetov, who used a human
capital approach (4, 42).
During 2008–2013, the total cost of
asthma based on the pooled sample was
estimated at $81.9 billion, of which 61%
was for medical costs; nearly 39% was
attributable to absenteeism and mortality.
These numbers are consistent with previous
studies which have suggested that increased
medical costs, influenced largely by costs of
services and medications, are primarily
responsible for increases in the total cost of
asthma; alternatively, the value of missed
workdays and school days is determined by
wages, whereas mortality costs depend on
the VSL (4, 27, 37).
Given that our analysis was based on
treated asthma, the study excluded possible
contributions to the costs by people with
lifetime or current asthma who did not use
any healthcare services in a given year (1).
For example in 2013, among about 22.6
million people with current asthma, only
15.5 million had treated asthma, which
means that about one in three persons with
current asthma had no asthma-related
encounter with a medical provider or a
pharmacy in that year. Acknowledging data
limitations for accurate estimation, we also
did not include nonmedical costs, such as
transportation, appointment wait time,
presenteeism (not fully functioning at work
because of illness), or intangible costs of
pain and suffering. Consequently, our
findings might actually underestimate the
total cost of asthma.
Our results are comparable to those
reported in 2013 by Jang and colleagues, who
estimated trends in asthma costs from 2000
through 2009 using MEPS data (38). Those
authors used lifetime asthma (vs. treated
asthma), which may account for the higher
cost of asthma: $47.2 billion in their study
versus $39.3 billion in our study in 2008 and
$69.4 billion in their study versus $53.9
billion in our study in 2009. Their
prescription medication costs accounted for
44% versus 51% in our analysis. In a recent
publication on healthcare expenditure in the

Nurmagambetov, Kuwahara, and Garbe: Cost of Asthma in the United States
353
 United States, Bui and colleagues reported
that in children with asthma, prescription
costs account for over 47% of all medical
costs associated with asthma, which is
comparable to our 51% estimate (39).
Rappaport and colleagues used 2007
MEPS data to estimate direct and indirect
costs of current asthma using a combination
of propensity score matching and GLM (43).
Their estimated $65.5 billion total cost of
asthma in the United States is comparable
to our estimates. Sullivan and colleagues
studied adults aged 18 years and older
based on 2003 and 2005 data (27). Their
estimated $2,099 of per-person medical
expenditure for asthma for 2005 is lower
than our estimated $2,698 for 2008. Using
treated asthma and the Heckman model,
which differs conceptually and statistically
from TPRM (32), they estimated that adults
with asthma had 1.2 more missed workdays
than adults without asthma. This is consistent
with our results of 1.8 (95% confidence
interval, 1.2–2.4) missed workdays regarding
work absenteeism (Table 5).
In a series of articles (44–46), Sullivan
and colleagues addressed healthcare use,
absenteeism, mortality, and associated costs
for school-aged children with asthma based
on 2007–2013 MEPS data. They found that
the total medical cost of asthma for school-
aged children was almost $6 billion (in
2015 U.S. dollars). Using a human capital
approach, they estimated the cost of 130
deaths at $211 million (in 2015 U.S.
dollars). According to those authors,
school-aged children with poor asthma
control incurred $3,063 higher cost than
children without asthma. Our results show
that persons with no health insurance had a
significantly lower incremental medical cost
of asthma than the population average of
$3,266, suggesting that these individuals
may have either paid for their asthma care
out of pocket and/or limited their care
seeking compared with the population
average.
Asthma also disproportionately affects
people living in urban areas (47, 48).
Previous studies have shown that indoor
and outdoor environmental pollution are
major factors contributing to higher risk for
asthma attacks and higher cost of asthma.
People with lower incomes often live in
places with higher concentrations of
environmental asthma triggers (49–52). On
one hand, the results of this study suggest
that poor people (with incomes ,100% of
the poverty threshold) have significantly
higher medical costs because of asthma
than those with higher incomes. On the
other hand, having other levels of income
(near poor, low, middle, high) does not
seem to affect medical costs (Figure 1).
People with very low income are also more
likely to qualify for Medicaid, which
essentially pays for high asthma treatment
costs. Environmental interventions to
reduce indoor asthma triggers for low-
income families have been found to be
cost-effective and are encouraged to reduce
the burden of asthma (50, 52, 53).
Our results also show that black and
Hispanic individuals have lower medical
costs for asthma relative to the population
average (Table 3). Multiple studies have
demonstrated that these groups have
consistently higher rates of hospitalizations
and ER visits associated with asthma
(54–56) but lower rates of asthma
prescription medications and outpatient
visits. This may explain their lower total
medical cost of asthma because prescription
medications and outpatient visits are the
two largest contributors to total medical
care costs (Table 2). Not having health
insurance or high out-of-pocket costs for
insured persons may preclude purchasing
asthma medications, particularly long-
acting antiinflammatory asthma drugs,
or seeking regular outpatient care.
Furthermore, language and health literacy
barriers may also limit the effectiveness
of asthma self-management education
(57, 58). Medicaid or other health
insurance coverage with lower out-
of-pocket payments may improve access
to routine care and prescription
medications for persons with asthma in
these groups.
Conclusions
This study suggests that the costs of
prescription medications and office-based
visits comprise the bulk of the medical costs
of asthma. The combined costs of medical
care, mortality, and absenteeism render the
total cost of asthma a substantial and serious
economic burden on society. These findings
highlight the critical need to support
and further strengthen asthma control
strategies through increased provision
of guideline-based care, improvements
in self-management, and reduction of
environmental asthma triggers to reduce
ER visits, hospitalizations, absenteeism,
and mortality. n
