Abstract
Throughout our lives we must perform tasks while being observed by others. Previous studies have shown that the presence
of an audience can cause increases in an individual’s performance as compared to when they are not being observed—a phe-
nomenon called ‘social facilitation’. However, the neural mechanisms underlying this effect, in the context of skilled-task
performance for monetary incentives, are not well understood. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to monitor
brain activity while healthy human participants performed a skilled-task during conditions in which they were paid based
on their performance and observed and not observed by an audience. We found that during social facilitation, social signals
represented in the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) enhanced reward value computations in ventromedial prefrontal
cortex (vmPFC). We also found that functional connectivity between dmPFC and ventral striatum was enhanced when par-
ticipants exhibited social facilitation effects, indicative of a means by which social signals serve to modulate brain regions
involved in regulating behavioral motivation. These findings illustrate how neural processing of social judgments gives rise
to the enhanced motivational state that results in social facilitation of incentive-based performance.

Introduction
A number of studies have reported that an individual’s perform-
ance accuracy or level of effort exertion can be improved when
working in the presence of others. These behavioral effects
have been shown in a diversity of species [e.g., humans (Bond
and Titus, 1983; Baumeister, 1984; Strauss, 2002), monkeys
(Harlow
and
Yudin,
1933;
Munkenbeck
Fragaszy
and
Visalberghi,
1990;
Visalberghi
and
Addessi,
2001),
insects
(Zajonc and Herman, 1969; Miramontes and DeSouza, 1996)]
and can take the form of audience effects in which the mere
presence
of
spectators
causes
increases
in
performance.
Previous psychological explanations have focused on the effects
of increased arousal (Zajonc, 1965, 1980), changes in attention
(Sanders, 1981; Bond, 1982; Baron, 1986), or worries about self
presentation (Bond, 1982; Bond and Titus, 1983) arising from ob-
servations by an audience.
Recently, human neuroimaging studies have begun to exam-
ine how social facilitation effects are processed in the brain.
These works have studied how audience effects influence char-
itable donation (Izuma et al., 2010), unskilled physical exertion
(Yoshie et al., 2016) and cognitive tasks (Mu
¨ ller-Pinzler et al.,
2015; Dumontheil et al., 2016), and have shown that when sub-
jects were observed they exhibited increased activity in brain
networks related to mentalizing (i.e. medial prefrontal cortex,
parietal cortex and intraparietal cortex). Indeed, dorsal aspects
of medial prefrontal cortex show enhanced activations when
observed by an audience, even when not performing a task or
being evaluated (Somerville et al., 2013). Notably, these studies

 did not attempt to dissociate neural processes related to audi-
ence observation and motivated performance, and none of
these studies examined how skilled-performance for monetary
incentives, and associated reward representations, were influ-
enced by the presence of an audience.
Building on a large literature demonstrating a strong associ-
ation (whether facilitatory or deleterious) between incentives
and behavioral performance (Ariely et al., 2009; Mobbs et al.,
2009; Chib et al., 2012; Chib et al., 2014), as well as a number of
studies that have implicated brain regions involved in encoding
reward valuation also being involved in encoding of social valu-
ations (Behrens et al., 2008; Lin et al., 2012; Janowski et al., 2013;
Ruff and Fehr, 2014), we propose an incentive-based account of
social facilitation effects during performance for monetary in-
centives. We suggest that successful incentivized performance
in the presence of an audience is evaluated as a positive out-
come, because performing well in front of others is perceived as
increasing social approval by others. Conversely, performing
poorly in the presence of an audience results in a perceived ad-
verse impact on one’s social standing. As a result, we hypothe-
size that individuals will be more motivated to perform a task
successfully in front of an audience compared to a scenario in
which no audience is present. In essence, the audience serves
to increase the incentive motivation for successful perform-
ance. To test this hypothesis, we measured behavior and col-
lected functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data while
participants performed an extensively trained, incentivized,
skilled motor task during conditions in which their performance
was observed by an audience and conditions in which they
were not observed.
Our incentive-based hypothesis of social facilitation makes
a number of distinct predictions about neural responses. First,
activity in brain regions sensitive to outcome value such as
the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) (Rangel et al.,
2008; Chib et al., 2009; Fitzgerald et al., 2009; Levy and
Glimcher, 2012), will show enhanced activity in response to
success compared to failure in observed relative to unob-
served trials during a monetarily incentivized task. Second,
during trials in which an audience observes a participant’s
performance, circuits involved in representing the thoughts
and intentions of other individuals, including the dorsomedial
prefrontal cortex (dmPFC), temporal parietal junction (TPJ) or
posterior superior temporal sulcus (STS) will be engaged
(Siegal and Varley, 2002; Frith and Frith, 2006; Saxe, 2006;
Somerville et al., 2013; Mu
¨ ller-Pinzler et al., 2015; Dumontheil
et al., 2016; Yoshie et al., 2016). Third, considering a number of
studies showing evidence that dmPFC plays a central role in
the ability to make inferences about the mental states of
others in general and during social value-based decision-mak-
ing (Siegal and Varley, 2002; Amodio and Frith, 2006; Hampton
et al., 2008;De Martino et al., 2013), we hypothesized there will
be increased functional connectivity between dmPFC and out-
come value areas (vmPFC) in the observed vs unobserved con-
ditions. This interaction will reflect the degree to which
awareness of being monitored modulates the reward-related
responses to success and failure. Fourth, since being observed
will result in enhanced motivation to perform successfully,
neural responses will be enhanced in the ventral striatum
(vSTR), a key brain structure that us and others have previ-
ously implicated in motivated instrumental motor perform-
ance (Bray et al., 2008; Talmi et al., 2008; Balleine and
O’Doherty, 2010; Chib et al., 2012, 2014;).
Materials and methods
Experimental design
Stimulus presentation and behavioral data acquisition were im-
plemented using custom designed Matlab (http://www.math
works.com) and Cþþ programs implementing the OpenGL
(Silicon Graphics Inc., USA) graphics libraries. During fMRI, vis-
ual feedback of targets and hand position were presented via a
projector
positioned
at
the
back
of
the
scanning
room.
Participants
viewed
a
reflection
of
the
projector
image
(800�600 pixels) in a mirror attached to the scanner head coil.
This system allowed us to display virtual images, video of ob-
servers, and manipulate visual feedback.
Direct view of participants’ arms was obscured since they
were positioned in the scanner head-first-supine and the dis-
play mirror blocked their view. A Vicon motion tracking system
(MX Ultranet system, with 4 MX40þ cameras; Oxford Metrics
Ltd., Oxford, UK) was used to record the motion of an infrared
reflective maker attached to the right index finger. During ex-
periments, these signals were sent to our custom designed soft-
ware
for
real-time
visual
feedback
of
participants’
hand
position. The position signals were also recorded for further off-
line analysis. Participants’ arm movements were confined to
the coronal plane, and visual feedback of these movements was
presented in 2 D on the visual display.
Experimental setup
Participants. All participants were right handed, and were pre-
screened to exclude those with a prior history of neurological or
psychiatric
illness.
The
California
Institute
of
Technology
Institutional Review Board approved this study, and all partici-
pants gave informed consent.
Twenty participants (mean age, 24.5; age range 19–32; 7 fe-
males) took part in the motor experiment. Forty male partici-
pants, in pairs of two, served as observers of the participants
performing the motor experiment. Male participants were al-
ways used as observers to remove any experimental confounds
that could be present related to gender. Scanned participants
and observers did not know each other before performing the
experiment, and participants were recruited from the Caltech
student population and the greater Pasadena/Los Angeles com-
munity. Participants performing the motor experiment had
never previously performed the motor task. Of the 20 partici-
pants performing the motor experiment, 1 participant was
excluded from the MRI analysis because of excessive movement
artifact, another participant was excluded from the social anx-
iety correlation because she did not complete the Liebowetz
Social Anxiety Scale.
Motor task. We modified an experimental task that we have
used in the past to examine skilled-task performance under
pressure (Chib et al., 2012, 2014). The experiment was comprised
of three phases that took place on two consecutive days. On the
first day participants practiced control of the spring-mass sys-
tem (training phase). For a more detailed description of the
spring-mass system see Chib et al. (2012). After the training
phase we determined participants’ rates of success at various
target sizes (thresholding phase). On the second day partici-
pants controlled the spring-mass system with the purpose of
winning money in the context of being watched or not being

 watched (testing phase). Both the training and thresholding
phases took place in a mock scanner to replicate the posture ne-
cessary in the scanning environment. The testing phase took
place in the fMRI scanner. Prior to the experiment participants
were told they would receive a show-up fee of $40 dollars at the
end of experiment.
The training phase was comprised of 500 trials. A trial began
when a participant put her hand cursor over the start position
(x) and ended after 2 s. At the end of the trial, the cursors
flashed green if the scoring criteria were met and red otherwise.
The target size was 50 mm2 throughout the training phase. The
thresholding phase was the same as the training phase in all re-
spects, except that it was comprised of 200 trials of varying size.
Target sizes range from 10 to 55 mm2 in increments of 5 mm2.
Each target size was randomly presented 20 times. From this
data we obtained a psychometric curve that represented partici-
pants’ performance over a range of target sizes.
During the testing phase participants were scanned with
fMRI while controlling the spring-mass system for reward.
During this phase 2 observers were seated in the scanning con-
trol room and participants were able to see a live video stream
of the observers on given trials during the motor experiment.
On select trials, the observers viewed a monitor displaying the
motor performance of participants. Before beginning the testing
phase participants were introduced to the observers so that
they knew the observers were actually present and watching
the experiment. On trials in which participants were watched,
the observers recorded on a score sheet if a participant was suc-
cessful or unsuccessful in performing the task. Prior to the ex-
periment, participants were told about the scoring by observers
and that that they would be shown their score sheet at the end
of the experiment. Together, these conditions ensured that par-
ticipants were cognizant of the fact that they were being
watched and evaluated during the observation conditions.
Participants were told that at the end of the experiment one
trial would be randomly selected and a payment made based on
their
performance
on
that
trial.
This
payout
mechanism
ensured that participants evaluated each trial independently.
Participants performed all trials for $25 and under conditions of
observation or no observation. The conditions consisted of trials
in which participants were observed and saw a live video
stream of the observers watching them, observed and saw a
scrambled video of the observers, were not observed and saw a
prerecorded video of observers not present during the experi-
ment and were not observed and saw a prerecorded scrambled
video. Using psychometric curves generated during the thresh-
olding phase, a target size was created for each participant such
that it coincided with a 60% unincentivized success rate. Each
experimental condition was randomly presented 40 times for a
total of 160 trials. At the beginning of each trial, participants
were shown a message indicating the amount of incentive they
were playing for and the experimental condition (jittered dur-
ation 2–5 s). They then performed the motor task, with the same
success criteria as during training (duration 2 s), and were
shown the trial outcome (1 s). At the end of each participants’
testing phase a single trial from their phase was selected at ran-
dom and the participant was paid based on performance on
that trial.
To summarize, our task has several important features: (1)
since our aim was to examine how performance in front of an
audience serves to enhance incentive based motivation and so-
cial facilitation, presentation of the incentive cues (i.e. reward
value and audience condition) and task execution were dissoci-
ated in time. This enabled us to separately examine signals
related to evaluation of the audience/incentive conditions and
processes related to task execution and outcome value. Notably,
previous studies of audience effects were not designed to disen-
tangle signals related to processing of audience observation,
motivational
performance
and
outcome
reward
value
(Morishima et al., 2012; Mu
¨ ller-Pinzler et al., 2015; Dumontheil
et al., 2016). (2) Since participants were highly trained before
entering the main experimental condition, early in motor per-
formance they had a strong sense about their potential outcome
on a given trial (i.e. success/failure), even before they were pre-
sented with the final outcome. In our previous studies of value-
based motor performance we consistently reported decreases in
outcome value encoding on unsuccessful trials compared to
successful trials (Chib et al. 2012, 2014), and we leveraged this
finding to examine how outcome values were modulated by
audience observation during task performance.
The original goal of our project was to investigate perform-
ance deterioration effects (i.e. choking under pressure) of social
observation as opposed to performance facilitation effects.
However, preliminary behavioral experiments conducted before
the acquisition of the fMRI experiment reported here, revealed a
performance facilitation effect in the range of incentives from
$0–$50 instead of a choking effect. As a consequence, we imple-
mented the current fMRI experiment to examine the neural
mechanisms underlying this social facilitation effect, using a
fixed incentive level of $25 which was within the range of incen-
tive levels we previously found to show facilitation effects.
MRI protocol. A 3-Tesla Siemens Trio (Erlangen, Germany) scan-
ner and standard radio frequency coil was used for all the MR
scanning sessions. To reduce the possibility of head movement
related artifact, participants’ heads were securely positioned
with foam position pillows. High resolution structural images
were collected using a standard MPRAGE pulse sequence, pro-
viding full brain coverage at a resolution of 1 mm�1 mm�1 mm.
Functional images were collected at an angle of 30� degrees
from the anterior commisure–posterior commisure (AC–PC)
axis, which reduced signal dropout in the reward-related brain
areas relative to AC–PC aligned images (Deichmann et al., 2003).
Forty-five
slices
were
acquired
at
a
resolution
of
3 mm�3 mm�3 mm, providing whole-brain coverage. A one-
shot echo-planar
imaging (EPI)
pulse sequence
was used
[TR ¼ 2800 ms, TE ¼ 30 ms, FOV ¼ 100 mm, flip angle ¼ 80�].
Self-report questionnaires. To assess the extent of participants’
anxiety associated with social interaction and performance
situations we implemented the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale
(LSAS) (Heimberg et al., 1999). This scale is made of two sub
scales that assess fear and avoidance of social situations.
Combining these sub scales returns a metric between 0 and 144
points that is widely used to characterize the level of an individ-
ual’s general propensity to exhibit social anxiety.
Participants also performed the Autism Spectrum Quotient
questionnaire (Woodbury-Smith et al., 2005) and the Behavioral
Avoidance/Inhibition Scales (Carver and White, 1994); however,
these measures were not analyzed further in the context of this
study.
Data analysis
Behavioral performance analysis. We evaluated participants’ be-
havioral performance as their percent success in the different
experimental conditions. We focused on comparing behavioral
performance between the observed and unobserved conditions.

 Kinematic trajectory analysis. To ensure participants’ movement
kinematics were the same across the observed and unobserved
conditions and that our imaging results were not confounded
by differing motor output for these conditions, we calculated
measures
of
hand
kinematics
during
successful
task
performance.
Hand accuracy. Endpoint accuracy was calculated as the distance
between a participant’s final hand position and the target cen-
ter (Euclidean norm). We found no differences in the hand ac-
curacy metric between the observed and unobserved conditions
(t19 ¼ 0.82, P ¼ 0.42).
Mean velocity. This velocity metric was the mean hand velocity
over the course of a movement trajectory. We found no differ-
ences in the velocity metric between the observed and unob-
served conditions (t19 ¼ 0.26, P ¼ 0.80).
Hand smoothness. This metric captures the average rate of
change of the acceleration of movement (jerk). It is calculated
by dividing the negative mean jerk magnitude by the peak
speed. Taking the negative of the mean jerk causes increases in
the jerk metric to correspond with increases in smoothness; in
this way it transforms the jerk metric from a measure of ‘non-
smoothness’ into a measure of smoothness. Normalizing the
mean jerk by the peak speed makes the measure robust to con-
founds arising from changes in overall movement speed. This
method was introduced in Roher et al. (2002). We found no dif-
ferences in the hand smoothness metric between the observed
and unobserved conditions (t19 ¼ 1.19, P ¼ 0.25).
Image analysis. The SPM8 software package was used to analyze
the fMRI data (Wellcome Department of Imaging Neuroscience,
Institute of Neurology, London, UK). A slice-timing correction
was applied to the functional images to adjust for the fact that
different slices within each image were acquired at slightly dif-
ferent points in time. Images were corrected for participant mo-
tion, spatially transformed to match a standard EPI template
brain included in the SPM software package, and smoothed
using a three-dimensional Gaussian kernel (6 mm FWHM) to ac-
count for anatomical differences between participants. This set
of data was then analyzed statistically.
General linear model. A general linear model (GLM) was used to
generate voxel-wise statistical parametric maps (SPMs) from
the fMRI data. We created participant-specific GLMs that mod-
eled the time of condition presentation and the time of the
motor task. We modeled two types of condition presentation:
trials in which participants were observed and not observed.
We included scrambled video conditions to control for possible
visual confounds in any potential post-hoc imaging analyses.
However for all analyses presented here, we collapsed across
scrambled and unscrambled video conditions to increase the
statistical power of our observed and unobserved conditions.
For the motor task, we modeled trials in which participants
were observed and successfully performed the task, were
observed and unsuccessful, were not observed and successful,
and were not observed and unsuccessful. This resulted in a
grand total of six modeled conditions. The incentive presenta-
tion events were modeled with a duration lasting the length of
incentive presentation (2–5 s), while the motor task events were
modeled with a fixed duration of 2 s. In addition, regressors
modeling the head motion as derived from the affine part of the
realignment produce were included in the model.
With this model we tested brain areas in which activity was
related to being observed at the time of incentive presentation
and during the motor task. This was done by creating contrasts
with the aforementioned conditions at the times of incentive
presentation and the motor task.
Experimental design and statistical analysis. Nineteen participants
were included in the analysis of the fMRI and behavioral data.
All
participants
performed
all
experimental
conditions:
observed by an audience with a live video feed of the audience;
observed by an audience with a live scrambled video feed of the
audience; not observed by an audience with a prerecorded
video; not observed by an audience with a scrambled prere-
corded video. We recorded participants performance (success/
failure and trajectory kinematics) on these trials. To assess so-
cial facilitation effects we collapsed across the video conditions
and performed a paired t test between the observed and the un-
observed conditions.
Second-level group contrasts from our GLM were calculated
as a one-sample t test against zero for each first-level linear
contrast. All activations were reported as significant if they sur-
vived family-wise error correction for multiple comparisons
across a sphere with radius 8 mm (SVC) centered on the peak of
activity isolated in independent studies. Illustrative bar plots, il-
lustrative covariate plots and our ROI analysis were generated
using coordinates centered on an 8 mm sphere at the peak of
activity isolated in independent studies. For vmPFC, we used
the coordinates [0, 53, 4] taken from Suzuki et al. (2012) which re-
ported decision-value signals in this region during neuroeco-
nomic choice in a social context; for dmPFC, we used the
coordinates [3, 51, 24] taken from Hampton et al. (2008) which re-
ported activity related to social context and functional connect-
ivity between this region and vmPFC during social value-based
decision-making.; for rTPJ and lTPJ, we used the coordinates [51,
�54, 27] and [�54, 60, 21] taken from Saxe and Kanwisher (2003)
which showed these regions to be related the theory of mind;
for premotor cortex, we used the coordinates [�30, �4, 61] taken
from Chib et al. (2014) which used this exact same motor task as
in this study. For vSTR we used an a priori anatomically defined
ROI (encompassing nucleus accumbens and ventral parts of the
putamen). This exact ROI was used in our previous studies
examining skilled performance for incentives (Chib et al., 2012,
2014). All ROIs were defined a priori and specified in Montreal
Neurological Institute stereotactic space coordinates.
The plots shown in Figures 2G and 3B, D and F are for illus-
trative purposes, in order to clarify the activation patterns in
their associated contrasts. For completeness, we also conducted
whole-brain analyses to complement our ROI analyses, and we
report the results of those whole-brain analyses in the tables.
Statistical inference was carried out in the SPM framework.
Psychophysiological interaction (PPI) analysis. To assess changes in
brain region connectivity as a function of task performance and
being watched by others, we carried out a PPI analysis. PPI is a
measure of context-dependent connectivity, which explains the
regional activity of other brain regions in terms of the inter-
action between responses in a seed region and cognitive or sen-
sory processes. We estimated the following PPI models using
the generalized PPI toolbox for SPM (McLaren et al., 2012):
PPI 1: The goal of this analysis was to investigate if activity in the
dmPFC was correlated with activity in the vmPFC at the time of
task execution as a function of social facilitation.

 For this analysis the PPI term was defined as Y � P. The physio-
logical
variable
Y
was
the
average
blood
oxygen
level-
dependent (BOLD) time course taken from all voxels in 6 mm
spheres surrounding the peak coordinates in the dmPFC seed
[x ¼ �3; y ¼ 53; z ¼ 25]. These peak coordinates for dmPFC were
obtained from the contrast reported in Figure 2C, restricting the
contrast to the independent ROI definition (an 8 mm sphere).
The psychological variable P was the trial by trial interaction be-
tween a participant’s behavioral performance (successful/un-
successful) and observation conditions (observed/unobserved).
This PPI was calculated for events occurring at the time of task
performance.
We entered the physiological variables Y, the psychological
variables P, the PPI interaction terms and movement regressors
into a new GLM. Importantly, this GLM also contained the main
experimental conditions. Thus, any effects on the PPI inter-
action reveal coupling that could not be explained from the mu-
tual correlation of the seed and target regions with performance
or observation factors. The PPI contrast illustrates areas in
which coupling between dmPFC is enhanced or decreased as a
function of task performance (success/failure) and observation
(observed/unobserved) conditions.
PPI 2. The goal of this analysis was to investigate if activity in the
vSTR was correlated with activity in the premotor cortex at the
time of task execution as a function of social facilitation.
This analysis was identical to the previous PPI. The physio-
logical variable Y was the BOLD time course taken from all vox-
els in two 6 mm spheres surrounding the peak coordinates in
the right [x ¼ 15; y ¼ 11; z ¼ �8] and left vSTR seeds [x ¼ �15;
y ¼ 5; z ¼ �11]. These peak coordinates for vSTR were obtained
from the contrast reported in Figure 3A. The psychological vari-
able P was the trial by trial interaction between a participant’s
behavioral performance (successful/unsuccessful) and observa-
tion conditions (observed/unobserved). This PPI was calculated
for events occurring at the time of task performance.
We entered the physiological variables Y, the psychological
variables P, the PPI interaction terms and movement regressors
into a new GLM. The PPI contrast illustrates areas in which cou-
pling between vSTR is enhanced or decreased as a function of
task performance (success/failure) and observation (observed/
unobserved) conditions.
PPI 3. The goal of this analysis was to investigate if activity in the
vSTR was correlated with activity in dmPFC at the time of condi-
tion presentation as a function of social facilitation during subse-
quent task execution.
This analysis was identical to the previous PPI. The physio-
logical variable Y was the BOLD time course taken from all vox-
els in two 6 mm spheres surrounding the peak coordinates in
right [x ¼ 15; y ¼ 11; z ¼ �8] and left vSTR seeds [x ¼ �15; y ¼ 5;
z ¼ �11]. These peak coordinates for vSTR were obtained from
the contrast reported in Figure 3A. The psychological variable P
was the trial-by-trial interaction between a participant’s behav-
ioral performance (successful/unsuccessful) and observation
conditions (observed/unobserved). A critical difference between
this PPI and the previous PPIs was that the psychological regres-
sors in this PPI were extracted for events at the time of condi-
tion presentation (i.e. before the task execution). This allowed
us to test how functional coupling before task execution was
related to subsequent social facilitation effects.
We entered the physiological variables Y, the psychological
variables P, the PPI interaction terms and movement regressors
into a new GLM. The PPI contrast illustrates areas in which
coupling between vSTR is enhanced or decreased as a function
of
task
performance
(success/failure)
and
observation
(observed/unobserved) conditions.
Results
Behavioral results indicate that participants’ average level of
success was significantly improved in the observed condition as
compared to the unobserved condition, illustrating the social fa-
cilitation effect of performance (t19 ¼ 2.54, P ¼ 0.02) (Figure 1B).
Neural representations of performance outcome value
We began testing our neural predictions of incentive-based so-
cial facilitation by estimating a GLM of BOLD activity that
included regressors for the different observation conditions at
the time of incentive presentation; and for the different obser-
vation conditions, separated by success or failure, at the time of
the motor task. To confirm an effect of performance outcome
value in vmPFC, irrespective of observation, we compared activ-
ity in vmPFC between trials in which individuals were success-
ful and unsuccessful during motor task performance, pooling
across observation conditions. It is important to note that since
the task required implementing rapid skilled motor response
toward a target, over a 2-s interval, which was followed
immediately (without jitter) by explicit feedback (informing par-
ticipants about winning or losing), we pooled over the trial com-
ponents when participants performed the motor action and
received feedback. This is justified because the hemodynamic
responses of these trial components are not dissociable due to
the rapid presentation and sluggishness of the BOLD response;
and participants could easily determine whether task perform-
ance on a given trial was a success or failure depending on their
motor performance even before they received the explicit feed-
back. These features allowed us to observe modulation of neural
activity related success or failure, and associated outcome val-
ues, when testing for effects during the motor performance
phase. In accordance with higher reward outcome values for tri-
als that were successful, as compared to those that were unsuc-
cessful, we found increased activity in vmPFC on successful
trials compared to unsuccessful trials (Figure 2A, Table 1). This
result replicates our previous findings in non-social reward-
based motor performance, in which participants performed the
exact same motor task and we observed outcome value encod-
ing at the time of execution related to successful/unsuccessful
performance (Chib et al., 2012, 2014). To examine our first pre-
diction, that reward outcome value representations would be
increased as a function of observation, we tested for an inter-
action between performance outcome and observation trials.
An ROI analysis of vmPFC found a significant interaction effect
in vmPFC consistent with enhanced reward outcome encoding
during observed trials that were successful vs unsuccessful
compared to unobserved trials that were successful vs unsuc-
cessful [Figure 2B; vmPFC ROI Analysis: F(1, 18) ¼ 4.42, P ¼ 0.04].
These results indicate that the neural representation of value is
increased on trials in which participants are observed. To fur-
ther test our prediction, and control for differences in kinematic
performance between successful and unsuccessful trials, we
also examined activity during successful and unsuccessful trials
separately because these trials exhibited no kinematic differ-
ences across observation conditions. This analysis confirmed
that vmPFC was more active during the observed condition
compared to the unobserved condition [vmPFC ROI Analysis:

Testing for the effects of imbalanced numbers of
successful vs unsuccessful trials
Social facilitation of performance results in a greater number of
successful trials in the observed condition than the unobserved
condition. To ensure our imaging results comparing observed
and unobserved conditions were not an artifact of an imbal-
anced number of trials, we randomly resampled participants
fMRI data to ensure the number of trials were balanced between
conditions, and performed first and second level imaging ana-
lyses on this resampled data. We began by determining, for
each participant, the minimum number of trials tmin in the suc-
cessful observed and unobserved conditions. We then selected,
randomly, without replacement, tmin trials from each condition
to ensure that the successful observed and unobserved condi-
tions contained the same number of trials for each participant.
We used a GLM to generate voxel-wise SPMs for the fMRI data
for each participant. Excess trials that were not selected during
the random extraction were modeled as a separate condition in
our GLM. Using these SPMs we created single participant
contrasts comparing successful observed and unobserved trials.

Fig. 1. Experimental task and behavioral performance. (A) At the beginning of each trial participants were informed about which experimental condition they were in.
Trials were always for $25. There were two observation conditions: one in which participants saw a live video stream of people in another room who were evaluating
their task performance (observed condition); and another condition in which participants saw a prerecorded video of people who were unfamiliar to them and not
evaluating their performance (unobserved condition). These conditions had a counterpart scrambled video condition. During condition presentation, to initiate the
motor task, participants placed their white hand cursor in the start position (x) for a random amount of time (2–5 s). During the task, a target (h) appeared that was
registered to a position 20 cm distal from the start. To successfully perform the task, participants had to place their hand cursor and a mass cursor into the target
within 2 s, while achieving a final velocity below 0.02 m/s. At the end of the trial they were shown a message indicating the outcome of their performance. In the case
that a participant successfully placed the spring-mass in the target, a positive message was displayed (‘You Won $25’); otherwise, the participant was informed of her
negative outcome (‘You Lost’). (B) Participants’ performance was significantly improved on trials in which their performance was observed by others (*P < 0.05). Error

 These contrasts were used to create a second-level group con-
trast for each fMRI experiment simulation. We repeated this
procedure 10 times to ensure that these results were invariant
as to the specific trials chosen, and we extracted parameter esti-
mates in ROIs in vmPFC and tested whether activity in this re-
gion was significantly increased when comparing the observed
and unobserved conditions in which these conditions had an
equal number of trials. In 10 out of 10 simulations, activity was
significantly increased (P < 0.05), suggesting that our imaging re-
sults were not an artifact of an imbalance in the number of tri-
als between the observed and unobserved conditions.
Neural representations of social facilitation
Our second prediction was that during the social observation
condition, brain regions involved in social cognition and in par-
ticular those areas involved in representing the thoughts and
intentions of others, would be engaged (Siegal and Varley, 2002;
Frith and Frith, 2006; Saxe, 2006). This hypothesis is supported
by supplementary whole-brain analyses identifying that dmPFC
and bilateral TPJ showed increased activity on social observa-
tion trials compared to non-observation trials that were suc-
cessful (Table 2).
For further analyses, we focused on the dmPFC, because of a
body of work suggesting that this region of the prefrontal cortex
plays a role in the ability to make inferences about the mental
states of others, in general, and during social value-based deci-
sion-making (Siegal and Varley, 2002; Amodio and Frith, 2006;
Hampton et al., 2008; De Martino et al., 2013). Notably, previous
neuroimaging studies of audience effects have also reported
increased activation in dorsal aspects of mPFC (Somerville et al.,
2013; Mu
¨ ller-Pinzler et al., 2015). If activity isolated in dmPFC
during observed trials reflects social cognition related to the
process of being watched, and if these computations are
involved in driving social facilitation effects, then we would ex-
pect signals in dmPFC to be associated with individual-specific
measures of social facilitation and concerns about how one is
perceived by others. To test this hypothesis we calculated a
measure of the extent of each participant’s social facilitation
(i.e. the difference between observed and unobserved perform-
ance) and used this measure as a covariate in our group level
analysis comparing social observation trials to non-observation
trials that were successful. We focused on successful trials in
this imaging analysis to ensure that there was a degree of inde-
pendence between the behavioral covariate, which captured
both successful and unsuccessful performance, and the fMRI
analysis. We have utilized a similar approach in our previous
studies of value-based motor performance (Chib et al., 2012,
2014). We found that participants with greater activations in
dmPFC, during trials in which their performance was observed
compared to when it was not observed, exhibited greater
amounts of social facilitation (Figure 2C [x ¼ 9, y ¼ 65, z ¼ 10];
Figure 2D: average of all voxel within the independent ROI of
dMPFC, r ¼ 0.74, P < 0.001). Even at a very liberal threshold
(P < 0.05 uncorrected) no other brain regions outside dmPFC
were found to respond in this manner. We also performed ROI
analyses of bilateral TPJ and found no significant correlations
between activity in these regions and the social facilitation met-
ric (rTPJ: r ¼ 0.10, P ¼ 0.68; lTPJ: r ¼ 0.23, P ¼ 0.35). Importantly,
when adjusting for multiple comparisons across these regions,
using a Bonferroni adjusted significance level of 0.017 (0.05/3),
the dMPFC correlation still remains significant. These results
align with previous studies of neural processing of audience ob-
servation (Somerville et al., 2013; Mu
¨ ller-Pinzler et al., 2015), and
support the idea that activity in dmPFC plays a role in mediating
social facilitation of performance.
To further test whether dmPFC activity is involved in track-
ing the effects of being watched, we also obtained an independ-
ent measure of the extent that participants are concerned about
how they are perceived by others [using the Liebowitz Social
Anxiety Scale (Liebowitz, 1987)], and related this social anxiety
measure to participants’ parameter estimates extracted from
voxels in dmPFC, when comparing the observed and unob-
served conditions. Since social anxiety is related to the extent of
one’s concern about being judged or evaluated by others, we ex-
pected that those participants who exhibited higher social anx-
iety scores would have greater dmPFC activation at the time of
task performance. A linear regression of individuals’ social anx-
iety score and dmPFC activity, at the time of task execution,
revealed a significant relationship (Figure 2E, r ¼ 0.50, P ¼ 0.03).
A regression of individuals’ social anxiety scores and behavioral
performance did not reach significance (r ¼ 0.09, P ¼ 0.71). While
these results at least partially support our claim about the
dmPFC’s role in social facilitation effects, it is important to in-
terpret them with caution as the correlation with social anxiety
measures is relatively weak, especially given that the sample
size of our study is not optimized for detecting individual differ-
ences of this kind.
Interaction between dmPFC and vmPFC during
social facilitation
We tested the third prediction, that dmPFC and vmPFC interact
as a function of social facilitation effects and task performance,
by carrying out a PPI at the time of task execution. For this ana-
lysis we created another GLM in which activations in a seed re-
gion of dmPFC (identified in the aforementioned GLM analysis)
were examined in relation to task-related whole brain func-
tional connectivity. In particular, we were interested in how
functional connectivity between dmPFC and other brain areas
might change as a function of being observed during trials in

 which participants were successful. This analysis revealed that
connectivity between dmPFC and vmPFC was increased on tri-
als in which individuals were observed and their performance
was successful or unsuccessful (Figure 2F and G; Table 3).
Notably, we found that there was even more enhanced connect-
ivity between these regions on unsuccessful observed trials,
compared to successful observed trials. This affirms the link be-
tween these brain regions and illustrates a potential neural
mechanism by which social computations about being observed
could enhance performance reward outcome valuations. These
results are consistent with previous studies of social decision-
making that have reported enhanced functional connectivity
between reward signals in vmPFC and mentalizing signals in
dmPFC (Hampton et al., 2008; De Martino et al., 2013;
Suzuki
et al., 2015).
Ventral striatum and social facilitation
We tested the fourth prediction, that the vSTR, which is a key
structure involved in mediating motivation for action (Bray
et al., 2008; Talmi et al., 2008; Balleine and O’Doherty, 2010),
would show increased activity under observation, we examined
brain activity at the time of initial condition presentation (when
participants were first informed which type of condition they
would be in—i.e. observed, unobserved). Our analyses were in-
formed by previous studies, using the exact same motor task,
that provided evidence consistent with a role for vSTR in media-
ting the influence of incentives on motor performance (Chib
et al., 2012, 2014). In the context of this study, we found
enhanced activity in vSTR when comparing observed trials to
unobserved trials, prior to task execution (Figure 3A and B,
Table 4). Moreover, an analysis of functional connectivity be-
tween vSTR activity and dmPFC at the time of condition presen-
tation, as a function of subsequent social facilitation, showed
that the degree of coupling between these areas was correlated
with behavioral effects of social facilitation within subjects
(Figure 3C and D): on trials in which participants subsequently
exhibited social facilitation they displayed enhanced functional
connectivity between vSTR and dmPFC. No other brain regions
were found to respond in this manner at a significance level of
P < 0.05 uncorrected. Furthermore, examining whole brain func-
tional connectivity at the time of task execution in a separate
PPI analysis, with vSTR as a seed interacted with observation
and performance conditions, revealed an enhanced coupling
between vSTR and premotor cortex (Figure 3E and F; Table 5). In
accordance with our previous findings (Chib et al., 2012, 2014),
these results are consistent with a role for vSTR underpinning
motivational effects on motor performance. Our results are also
consistent with the possibility that dmPFC inputs to vSTR may
act on the motor drive that leads to social facilitation effects.
However, it is important to note that our connectivity analyses
do not allow direct inference about the directionality of the ef-
fects between dmPFC and vSTR and vSTR and premotor cortex.
Discussion
Our findings provide a neurobiological account of the social fa-
cilitation of monetarily incentivized behavioral performance.
Brain regions previously found to be involved in reward out-
come valuation, social cognition and motivation (Liljeholm and
O’Doherty, 2012; Bartra et al., 2013; Ruff and Fehr, 2014)—the
vmPFC, dmPFC and vSTR—were found to exhibit increased acti-
vation during conditions in which participants’ performance is
observed by an audience as compared to when they were not
observed. Moreover, activity in dmPFC was related to the degree
to which participants exhibited increased performance in re-
sponse to social observation. Furthermore, the degree of cou-
pling between dmPFC and vmPFC and dmPFC and vSTR was
found to be related to such improvements in behavioral per-
formance during social observation.
Our results suggest that during social facilitation, social sig-
nals represented in the dmPFC enhance reward value computa-
tions in vmPFC. Essentially, successful performance, when
watched by others, increases reward representations in vmPFC.
When examining the motivational signals related to social fa-
cilitation we found that vSTR had enhanced activity when indi-
viduals were observed compared to when they were not
observed, and that social signals in dmPFC served to boost mo-
tivational signals in the vSTR. Moreover, these motivational sig-
nals in vSTR were coupled with premotor activity, suggesting a
mechanism by which social motivation instantiated by dmPFC–
vSTR connectivity influences motor execution. While our cur-
rent experimental paradigm was not designed to examine the
causal connectivity between brain activity in these regions, our
results suggest that dmPFC encodes social signals which serve
to enhance both value representations and motivated motor
performance.

 monetary earnings—judgments of others modulate the reward-
value associated with successful performance, and the motiv-
ation for subsequent performance. Our findings are consistent
with a number of studies that have implicated mentalizing
areas of the brain, in particular dmPFC, in encoding an individ-
ual’s sense of reputation during tasks in which on monetary in-
centives were not offered (Ochsner et al., 2005; D’Argembeau
et al., 2007; Izuma, 2012; Somerville et al., 2013; Mu
¨ ller-Pinzler
et al., 2015). Furthermore, our study extends this work by exam-
ining how social signals might serve to modulate reward out-
come values and motivation during tasks in which individuals
are watched by an audience and payment is contingent on
performance.
Our findings also have implications for psychological ex-
planations of audience effects and social facilitation. According
to our incentive-based account being watched by others serves
to increase motivation and outcome values, and these changes
could result in allocation of attentional resources away from
the skilled-motor task. In this sense divergence of attention re-
sulting from concern about the audience may provide a poten-
tial role in modulating facilitation. However, we did not find
evidence for behavioral measures correlating with the front-
parietal attention network (Corbetta and Shulman, 2002), as
would be predicted by attentional theories. While this does not
completely rule out attention in the phenomenon, such effects
do not appear to be mediated by the neural networks commonly
implicated in controlling attention. Instead, our findings of
increased dmPFC activation during social facilitation, and cor-
relations between social anxiety scores and behavioral effects,
align more with a self-presentation account of social facilitation
in which the presence of an audience makes participants con-
cerned about how they are perceived by others (Bond, 1982;
Bond and Titus, 1983). These social concerns may then lead to
increased drive and facilitation effects on performance.
Our investigation focused on the brain activity responsible for
encoding the cognitive states related to social facilitation, and we
were especially careful to control for motoric performance con-
founds during our experimental analyses. Our analysis of differ-
ences in neural activity between observed and unobserved trials
revealed greater activity in the vSTR, at trial onset. This is in
keeping with other experiments showing that vSTR encodes mo-
tivational signals related to anticipation of future rewards during
instrumental tasks (Knutson et al., 2001; Pessiglione et al., 2007;
Talmi et al., 2008; Chib et al., 2012), and facilitation of behavioral
performance in the context of negative evaluation (Prevost et al.,
2017). Our functional connectivity analysis illustrated an increase
in connectivity between vSTR and premotor cortex on trials in
which social facilitation occurred, suggesting that the vSTR might
serve as the motivational interface that drives motoric perform-
ance resulting in social facilitation.
Previous studies have provided evidence that activity in
brain systems involved in neuroeconomic valuation exhibit
task-relevant coupling with areas involved in social cognition
such as dmPFC (Hampton et al., 2008; De Martino et al., 2013;
Suzuki et al., 2015). For example, these studies have found that
representations of the value of particular decision options
within the valuation system are modulated by social computa-
tions involving: the strategy being adopted by other agents
(Hampton et al., 2008); beliefs about group behavior (Suzuki
et al., 2015); or even the collective behavior of financial markets
(De Martino et al., 2013). One limitation of this study is that the
nature of the phenomenon being studied is such that we could
not obtain insight into the specific nature of the social computa-
tions being implemented within the social cognition network
that act to influence brain systems involved in valuation and
motivation, as the current task paradigm is not amenable to a
computational model-based approach. Future studies could
begin to probe the nature of the computations by for example
deploying multivariate analysis tools to determine whether
other agents in the audience are specifically encoded at particu-
lar times during the task, and if those representations are
modulated by successful vs unsuccessful performance. Another
important future direction would be to begin to unpack the tem-
poral dynamics of audience effects on behavior, perhaps using
techniques with more finegrained temporal resolution than
fMRI such as MEG or EEG, as this might enable more robust in-
ferences about the directionality of the interaction effects be-
tween the different systems that underpin the behavioral
effects of social facilitation.
It is also important to note that a number of studies have re-
ported audience effects that lead to decreases in performance or
‘choking’ under pressure (Bond and Titus, 1983), yet here we
examined the case in which social situations lead to increases
in performance. It is possible that social inhibition effects of
performance could occur under conditions in which larger audi-
ences are present, when large incentives are offered while being
viewed by an audience, or as the result of an interaction be-
tween incentives and social cues. It seems plausible that a simi-
lar
network
of
brain
regions
as
those
mediating
social
facilitation may also be involved in such social choking effects.
Notably, while we found overall increased connectivity between
dmPFC and vmPFC when comparing observed to unobserved
trials, we found that trials that were unsuccessful yielded the
greatest degree of coupling between these regions. This sug-
gests the possibility that a similar mechanism might underlie
effects of observation on deleterious effects on performance, al-
though such behavioral effects were not found in this study.
Investigating the role of the regions we have identified here dur-
ing other aspects of social observation and performance will be
an important future direction in dissecting the general neural
signals that influence both facilitory and deleterious influences
of observation on performance.
An improved understanding of the neurobiology of audience
effects on performance will have applications in a myriad of en-
vironments in which individuals’ performance is observed by
others, such as employees being observed their managers, stu-
dents being evaluated by their teachers, and even patients being
monitored by their physical therapists. By understanding how
such social situations influence performance, we may design
better social environments that can enhance behavioral per-
formance and learning.
