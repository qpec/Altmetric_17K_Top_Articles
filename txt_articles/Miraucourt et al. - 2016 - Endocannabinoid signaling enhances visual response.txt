Abstract Type 1 cannabinoid receptors (CB1Rs) are widely expressed in the vertebrate retina,
but the role of endocannabinoids in vision is not fully understood. Here, we identified a novel
mechanism underlying a CB1R-mediated increase in retinal ganglion cell (RGC) intrinsic excitability
acting through AMPK-dependent inhibition of NKCC1 activity. Clomeleon imaging and patch clamp
recordings revealed that inhibition of NKCC1 downstream of CB1R activation reduces intracellular
Cl� levels in RGCs, hyperpolarizing the resting membrane potential. We confirmed that such
hyperpolarization enhances RGC action potential firing in response to subsequent depolarization,
consistent with the increased intrinsic excitability of RGCs observed with CB1R activation. Using a
dot avoidance assay in freely swimming Xenopus tadpoles, we demonstrate that CB1R activation
markedly improves visual contrast sensitivity under low-light conditions. These results highlight a
role for endocannabinoids in vision and present a novel mechanism for cannabinoid modulation of
neuronal activity through Cl� regulation.

Introduction
Endocannabinoids (eCBs) are lipid-derived regulators of synaptic transmission that serve as impor-
tant mediators of functional plasticity (Bellocchio et al., 2013; Bender et al., 2006; Clapper et al.,
2010; El Manira and Kyriakatos, 2010; Han et al., 2012; Kato et al., 2012; Sjo
¨stro
¨m et al., 2003)
and nervous system development (Argaw et al., 2011; Berghuis et al., 2007; Harkany et al., 2008;
Li et al., 2009). In the retina, high levels of type 1 cannabinoid receptors (CB1R), as well as the eCB
production and degradation machinery, have been found in all vertebrate models tested, and within
nearly all retinal cell types throughout development and adulthood (Straiker et al., 1999;
Yazulla, 2008; Zabouri et al., 2011). Although eCB modulation of voltage-dependent Ca2+ and K+
conductances, typically resulting in the downregulation of neurotransmitter release, has been dem-
onstrated at multiple stages of retinal processing from photoreceptors to retinal ganglion cells
(RGCs) (Fan and Yazulla, 2003; Lalonde et al., 2006; Middleton and Protti, 2011; Yazulla et al.,
2000), these observations have not been directly linked to specific perceptual outcomes. On the

 other hand, cannabis consumption in humans has been reported to positively modulate contrast dis-
crimination (Russo et al., 2004; West, 1991). Given the overall importance of eCB signaling in mod-
ulating neuronal activity, we set out to test whether retinal eCB signaling impacts visual function,
and if so, by what modes of action.
The transparency and amenability to whole-cell recording of the Xenopus laevis tadpole permits
the application of both functional imaging and electrophysiological recording in the visual system of
the intact animal. Exploiting the strengths of this model, we demonstrate a novel mechanism by
which eCB signaling increases the intrinsic excitability of RGCs through AMPK-dependent inhibition
of the Na+-K+-2Cl� co-transporter 1 (NKCC1). NKCC1 inhibition causes a reduction in intracellular
Cl� levels, which enhances tonic glycinergic currents and hyperpolarizes the resting membrane
potential in RGCs. We show that membrane hyperpolarization actually makes RGCs fire more spikes
in response to subsequent stimulation. Accordingly, we found that activation of CB1Rs produces a
marked reduction of the contrast threshold needed to trigger a visually evoked escape behavior by
tadpoles under dim light conditions, consistent with enhanced visual perception.
Results
CB1R is present in the retina of Xenopus laevis tadpoles
The presence of CB1Rs has been reported in the brain of the adult Xenopus laevis frog (Cesa et al.,
2001; Cottone et al., 2003) and in the tadpole olfactory bulb (Breunig et al., 2010; Czesnik et al.,
2007). We examined the retinae of Xenopus tadpoles, and found intense CB1R immunoreactivity
(CB1R-IR) in the outer and inner plexiform layers (Figure 1a,b; Figure 1—figure supplement 1),
consistent with reports in other species (Middleton and Protti, 2011; Yazulla et al., 2000;
Zabouri et al., 2011). Somatic CB1R-IR has been described in the RGCs of salamander and chick
(Straiker et al., 1999), but not in rat (Yazulla et al., 1999). Using Isl2b:GFP transgenic frogs, in
which expression of green fluorescent protein (GFP) in the retina is restricted to RGCs, we found
CB1R-IR associated with GFP-positive RGCs in histological sections (Figure 1c) and in overnight dis-
sociated retinal cultures (Figure 1d). These data show that CB1R-IR is present at multiple levels,
including in RGCs within the retina of the tadpole, consistent with a role for the eCB system in early
visual processing.
CB1R activation increases RGC firing in response to visual stimulation
Extracellular multi-unit recordings in isolated eye preparations (Figure 2a) revealed that application
of the CB1R agonist WIN 55,212-2 (1 mM) increased spiking rates of RGCs in response to both full
field light-ON (before: 34.2 ± 3.1 Hz, after: 43.3 ± 4.6 Hz, n = 10, p=0.010, two-way RM ANOVA)
and light-OFF (before: 37.2 ± 3.1 Hz, after: 45.2 ± 4.2 Hz, n = 10, p=0.011) stimuli (Figure 2b,c; Fig-
ure 2—figure supplement 1a,d). This cannabinoid-mediated enhancement of evoked RGC
responses was confirmed using a different CB1R agonist arachidonyl-2’-chloroethylamide (ACEA,
1 mM) which gave a similar enhancement of spiking to light-OFF stimuli (Figure 2d; Figure 2—figure
supplement 1b,e; before: 30.5 ± 4.1 Hz, after: 40.0 ± 6.0 Hz, n = 10, p=0.033). To assess whether
endogenous cannabinoids produced by the retina can generate this effect in the absence of exoge-
nous ligand, we applied URB597 (2 mM), a selective inhibitor of fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH),
the enzyme that degrades the eCB anandamide (AEA). URB597 treatment caused elevated spiking
rates in response to light-ON (before: 22.8 ± 5.3 Hz, after: 31.3 ± 6.6 Hz, n = 10, p=0.049) and light-
OFF stimulation (Figure 2e; Figure 2—figure supplement 1c,f; before: 51.0 ± 7.0 Hz; after: 61.7 ±
10.3 Hz, n = 10, p=0.031), suggesting that AEA synthesized in the retina is able to modulate visual
responses.
CB1R activation could act by modulating visual responses in retinal cells upstream of RGCs or by
directly increasing RGC excitability. We first performed electroretinogram (ERG) recordings in the
isolated eye preparation to test if WIN 55,212-2 application modulated responses in the outer layers
of the retina (Figure 2f). ERGs revealed visual responses of various non-spiking cell types in the
outer retina, including photoreceptors (a-wave), ON-center bipolar cells (b-wave) and OFF-center
bipolar cells (d-wave). Visual stimulation produced stable ERG responses that were generally more
robust for light-OFF stimuli, consistent with previous reports in the Xenopus visual system
(Engert et al., 2002; Zhang et al., 2000). However, perfusion of WIN 55,212-2 did not produce any

 significant changes in the amplitudes of the a-, b- or d-waves in response to step increments or dec-
rements of light (Figure 2g, n = 6, 6, 6, 6; p=0.78, 0.79, 0.89, 0.68, two-way RM ANOVA), suggest-
ing that CB1R activation does not impact light-evoked activity in the outer part of the retina,
consistent with a recent report in the mouse (Ce
´cyre et al., 2013).
Local activation of CB1Rs at bipolar axon terminals could potentially modify Ca2+ influx to modu-
late the release of glutamate onto RGC dendrites. Similarly, CB1Rs at inhibitory amacrine presynap-
tic contacts could alter Ca2+ influx to modulate the release of GABA or glycine. Such effects would
go undetected in ERG recordings but would alter the spiking output of RGCs. To test these possibil-
ities, we used retinal electroporation to express the genetically-encoded Ca2+ reporter GCaMP6s in
bipolar and amacrine cells to measure Ca2+ levels in vivo at their presynaptic terminals in response
to light flashes (Figure 3a–i). Light stimulation reliably evoked strong Ca2+ transients in individual

 bipolar axon terminals (Figure 3b). Comparing average peak Ca2+ transients evoked by full-field
light-ON and light-OFF stimulation before and after WIN 55,212-2 perfusion (Figure 3c), we found
that CB1R activation did not increase bipolar axon Ca2+ transient amplitude in response to visual
stimulation, but instead decreased it in the case of light-OFF stimulation (Figure 3d,e, ON: n = 10,
p=0.17, OFF: n = 10, p=0.002), consistent with reports from salamander of a CB1R-mediated reduc-
tion of the L-type Ca2+ current12. Thus, its effects on Ca2+ at bipolar cell terminals appear more likely
to reduce than to increase RGC spiking. Peak Ca2+ transients in amacrine cell terminals evoked by

 light-ON and light-OFF stimulation were not significantly different before and after WIN 55,212-2
perfusion (Figure 3f–i, ON: n = 10, p=0.36; OFF: n = 10, p=0.48).
Effects on synaptic inputs to RGCs were also analyzed by in vivo whole-cell voltage clamp record-
ings from RGCs, held at �65 mV and 0 mV to reveal excitatory (EPSC) and inhibitory postsynaptic
currents (IPSC) evoked by visual stimulation, respectively (Figure 3j–p). Application of WIN 55,212-2
resulted in a significant decrease in the total integrated EPSC, measured over 1 s following stimulus
onset (Figure 3m,n, n = 7, p=0.025, two-way RM ANOVA, before vs. +WIN simple effect). Inhibitory
synaptic input in response to light-ON stimuli was unchanged by WIN 55,212-2 (Figure 3o, n = 5,
p=0.199, two-way RM ANOVA with Holm-Sidak posthoc test) but a decrease in the total integrated
IPSC in response to light-OFF stimulation was observed (Figure 3p, n = 5, p=0.029). Taken together
these data indicate that, cannabinoid modulation of excitatory synaptic inputs onto RGCs is, if any-
thing, acting in the wrong direction to enhance firing in response to visual stimuli. On the other hand
it is possible that disinhibition may in part contribute to this phenomenon.
An alternative mechanism by which cannabinoids might enhance visually evoked firing rates
would be to directly elevate the intrinsic excitability of RGCs, making it easier for them to fire action
potentials. The simplest way this might occur would be through depolarization of the resting mem-
brane potential closer to the threshold for firing. However, studies in salamander retina have sug-
gested that membrane depolarization can cause sodium channel inactivation that paradoxically
hinders action potential generation (Weick and Demb, 2011). Thus, the cannabinoid-mediated
enhancement of RGC responsiveness could potentially be due one or a combination of synaptic dis-
inhibiton, mechnanisms that depolarize or that hyperpolarize resting membrane potential.
CB1R-mediated enhancement of RGC firing requires glycinergic
transmission and NKCC1 activity
To elucidate these mechanisms, we examined the effects of various pharmacological manipulations
on the cannabinoid-mediated modulation of responses to full-field light-OFF (Figure 4) or light-ON
stimuli (Figure 4—figure supplement 1). Pretreatment with the CB1R blocker AM-251 (5 mM)
completely prevented the potentiating effects of WIN 55,212-2 (Figure 4a, n = 10, p=0.487, one-
tailed one-way RM ANOVA) or ACEA (Figure 4b, n = 10, p=0.360) on RGC firing, further underscor-
ing the requirement for CB1R activation. The enhancement produced by elevating endogenous AEA
using URB597 (Figure 2e) was also prevented by AM-251 (Figure 4c, n = 10, p=0.500). The selective
GABA-A receptor blocker gabazine (6 mM) had no specific effect on visually-evoked spike rates and
did not prevent the WIN 55,212-2-induced increase in RGC firing in response to light (Figure 4d, n
= 10, p=0.012). However, strychnine (60 mM), a potent and selective antagonist of glycine receptors
(GlyRs) prevented (Figure 4e, n = 10, p=0.423) and reversed (Figure 4f, n = 10, p=0.044) the
enhancement caused by WIN 55,212-2 application. These results show that both CB1Rs and GlyRs
are required for the cannabinoid-mediated increase in RGC response to visual stimulation. We fur-
ther investigated whether this synergy could be due to a CB1R-dependent regulation of the gradient
of [Cl�] across the plasma membrane, which provides the driving force for glycinergic current.
Intracellular Cl� is regulated in most neurons by the coordinated activities of NKCC1 and the K+-
Cl� cotransporter 2 (KCC2) which shuttle Cl� ions into and out of the cell respectively (Ben-
Ari, 2002). Previous studies have identified the regulation of [Cl�]i levels by NKCC1 activity as a
mechanism mediating inhibitory plasticity in immature hippocampal neurons (Balena and Woodin,
2008). NKCC1 and KCC2 are co-expressed in RGCs in fish retina (Dmitriev et al., 2007), and we
were able to detect both mRNAs in stage 45 Xenopus retina (Figure 4i). Perfusion of the selective
NKCC1 inhibitor bumetanide (10 mM) alone was sufficient to increase the firing rates of RGCs in
response to light, mimicking the effect of CB1R activation (Figure 4g, n = 10, p=0.025). Subsequent
addition of WIN 55,212-2 in the presence of bumetanide produced no additional increase in RGC fir-
ing rate (n = 10, p=0.224). Furthermore, WIN 55,212-2 application (Figure 4h, n = 9, p=0.012)
occluded the increase in RGC firing rate produced by adding bumetanide (Figure 4h, n = 9,
p=0.224 vs. WIN alone). These results argue that CB1R activation may work by regulating NKCC1
function to modulate the driving force of chloride currents in RGCs.
NKCC1 activity can be regulated through serine/threonine phosphorylation of its intracellular
domains. In mammals, the WNK-activated Sterile-20 (Ste20)-related Proline/Alanine-rich Kinase
(SPAK) and Oxidative Stress-Response Kinase 1 (OSR1) have been shown to stimulate human

ulatory molecules by performing western blotting on retina homogenates from animals treated with

 accompanied by an increase in phospho-NKCC1T212/T217 (Figure 4—figure supplement 1i). Thus,
SPAK/OSR1, although activated, appears not to phosphorylate and activate NKCC1 under these
conditions. Moreover, our physiology data would have predicted decreased NKCC1 activity. We
therefore wondered whether AMPK activation might be suppressing NKCC1 function. Because no
phospho-specific antibody against the AMPK site S77 on NKCC1 is available, we instead tested this
hypothesis functionally by using the selective AMPK inhibitor dorsomorphin. We found that dorso-
morphin (10 mM) reversed the effects of WIN 55,212-2, reducing RGCs spiking rate in response to
light-OFF flashes (before: 37.5 ± 6.3 Hz, after: 22.9 ± 2.6 Hz, Figure 4l, n = 10, p=0.0095, paired
t-test). These results indicate that CB1R signaling inhibits NKCC1 through the activation of AMPK.
CB1R activation lowers [Cl�]i specifically in RGCs
The inhibition of NKCC1 in RGCs should manifest as a reduction in [Cl�]i. To measure changes in
[Cl�]i we performed in vivo imaging of retinae electroporated to express a modified Cerulean(CFP)-
Topaz(YFP) version of Cl� reporter Clomeleon (Kuner and Augustine, 2000), and made ratiometric
measurements of Fo
¨ ster resonance energy transfer (FRET) (Figure 5a). Clomeleon-expressing RGCs,
bipolar cells, amacrine cells and Mu
¨ ller glia were identified based on morphology and location.
RGCs could be distinguished from displaced amacrine cells in the ganglion cell layer by the presence
of axonal processes. Baseline two-photon z-stacks of cyan and yellow fluorescence were collected
every 2 min for 10 min, before and after the onset of WIN 55,212-2 perfusion at 10 min, as in the
example shown in Figure 5b and quantified in Figure 5c. In all experiments, CB1R activation consis-
tently caused a rapid decrease in the cyan:yellow emission ratio in RGCs (Figure 5d,e, n = 15 cells,
p=0.001, two-way RM ANOVA with Holm-Sidak post-test) indicating a reduction in [Cl�]i. No FRET
changes in amacrine (n = 16, p=0.649), bipolar (n = 12, p=0.972) or Mu
¨ ller glia (n = 8, p=0.997) cell
types were detected (Figure 5e). The decrease in the cyan:yellow emission ratio in RGCs was not
observed when expressing a control Cl�-insensitive Clomeleon-M69Q construct (Figure 5f, n = 5,
p=0.996). Pretreatment with AM-251 (n = 8) or bumetanide (n = 9) prevented any changes in [Cl�]i
upon addition of WIN 55,212-2 (Figure 5f, p=0.996 for both). These data suggest that CB1R activa-
tion induces a RGC-specific decrease in [Cl�]i by regulating NKCC1 activity. To determine if synaptic
activity might contribute to the changes in [Cl�]i, we blocked synaptic transmission with a cocktail of
DNQX (20 mM), AP4 (50 mM), picrotoxin (100 mM), strychnine (60 mM) and TTX (1 mM). With synaptic
block, WIN 55,212-2 application still significantly decreased the cyan:yellow ratio in RGCs
(Figure 5g, n = 14, p<0.001). These data indicate that retinal CB1R activation rapidly decreases
[Cl�]i specifically in RGCs through a NKCC1-dependent and neurotransmission-independent
mechanism.
CB1R-mediated Cl� extrusion hyperpolarizes RGCs and increases
intrinsic excitability
We next sought to electrophysiologically confirm the cannabinoid-mediated decrease in [Cl�]i by
testing whether WIN 55,212-2 application induced a negative shift in the reversal potential of glyci-
nergic currents (EGly) in RGCs in vivo (Figure 6a). Ideally, gramicidin-perforated patch clamp record-
ings would be used to prevent Cl� in the recording pipette from disrupting intracellular
concentrations; however, this technique proved to be too difficult for in vivo RGC recordings. We
therefore followed the example of Ferrini et al. (2013) who used conventional whole-cell voltage
clamp recordings to detect Cl� extrusion from spinal neurons (Ferrini et al., 2013). RGCs were filled
through the recording pipette with a fluorescent dye to confirm their identity based on their den-
dritic morphologies and the presence of an axonal projection to the optic tectum (Figure 6b–d). We
measured EGly by generating current-voltage (I-V) plots of peak current evoked by a brief application
of glycine (500 mM for 20 ms) over a range of holding potentials (Figure 6e). A small but significant
leftward shift for EGly could be seen following wash-on of WIN 55,212-2 in the bath (DV = �3.2 ± 0.8
mV, n = 7, p=0.008). Inhibition of NKCC1 with bath application of bumetanide produced a similar
shift in EGly (Figure 6f, DV = �1.6 ± 0.5 mV, n = 5, p=0.026). Thus, electrophysiological recordings
confirm that WIN 55,212-2 lowers intracellular Cl�.
Based on these findings, we predicted that Cl� currents in RGCs, such as those mediated by
GlyRs, should hyperpolarize the RGC membrane potential in response to CB1R activation. We tested
this prediction by performing gramicidin-perforated patch recordings on dissociated cultured RGCs.

 To identify RGCs in dissociated retinal cultures, we used Isl2b:EGFP transgenic tadpoles that express
GFP in RGCs (Figure 6g). Application of WIN 55,212-2 significantly hyperpolarized RGCs
(Figure 6h, uncorrected for liquid junction potential; n = 6, p=0.004, paired t-test). This shift was
prevented in the presence of AM-251 (Figure 6i, n = 6, p=0.14, one-way RM ANOVA). This experi-
ment not only confirms that CB1R activation can hyperpolarize RGCs, but the fact that it does so in
isolated cells, shows that this effect does not depend on cannabinoid actions on other cells in the
retina.
How might CB1R-mediated hyperpolarization result in the enhanced intrinsic excitability of
RGCs? RGCs are known to decrease their excitability following a period of depolarization and firing
through the inactivation of voltage-gated sodium channels as a way of extending their dynamic
range (Kim and Rieke, 2001, 2003; Weick and Demb, 2011). Hyperpolarization, by facilitating
recovery from inactivation, may therefore increase the intrinsic excitability of RGCs. We examined
whether a brief hyperpolarizing pre-pulse could indeed enhance the excitability of Xenopus RGCs in
vivo. During whole-cell current-clamp recordings from RGCs, a pre-pulse of 100 ms hyperpolarizing
or depolarizing current (range: �100 to +80 pA) was injected, and 25 ms later a 100 ms depolarizing
test pulse (200 pA) was applied (Figure 6j). The number of spikes evoked by the test pulse was sub-
stantially elevated following hyperpolarizing pre-pulses, whereas it decreased after depolarizing pre-
pulses (Figure 6k). The 25 ms interval between pre-pulse and test pulse facilitated spike counting,
but the effect was also evident in experiments where the test pulse followed immediately after the
pre-pulse.
Sustained retinal stimulation induces CB1R-dependent enhancement of
RGC firing
eCBs can be released from neurons in response to stimulation driving a prolonged increase in intra-
cellular Ca2+ (Hashimotodani et al., 2007). We wondered whether in the retina, physiological eCB
release might similarly be induced by a sustained increase in luminance. We therefore measured the
extracellular RGC response to stimulation of a small central visual subfield (8 degrees) by presenting
a 1 s light-OFF test stimulus every 10 s, and attempted to modulate the response by introducing a
sustained increase in the luminance of the far surrounding peripheral field for 100 s as the condition-
ing stimulation (Figure 7a,b). In the sample recording traces (Figure 7b) and corresponding peristi-
mulus time histogram (Figure 7c) shown, conditioning stimulation converted an initially weak set of
responses into a robust biphasic response. In a significant majority of cases, sustained peripheral illu-
mination elevated the RGC spike rate evoked by light-OFF test stimuli in the central subfield
(Figure 7e, before: 4.2 ± 1.6 Hz, after: 8.8 ± 2.4 Hz, n = 10, p=0.042, paired t-test). This conditioning
stimulation appeared to recruit responses of RGCs that were not initially activated by the test stimu-
lus (Figure 7b) as evidenced by the appearance of new spike forms. Furthermore, the effects of con-
ditioning stimulation were prevented by bath application of AM-251 (before: 6.9 ± 2.8 Hz, after: 4.7
± 1.6 Hz, n = 10, p=0.244) (Figure 7b,d,f), consistent with a CB1R-dependent mechanism.
As predicted by our model, conditioning with peripheral field stimulation also induced a CB1R-
dependent decrease of [Cl�]i in RGCs. We demonstrated this using in vivo two-photon microscopy
to image clomeleon-transfected cells in the eye every 2 min before and immediately after projecting
a conditioning peripheral field stimulus, consisting of 100 s of darkness followed by 100 s of periph-
eral illumination while continuously presenting 1 s flashes in the central subfield every 10 s, through
the objective of the two-photon microscope directly onto the retina (Engert et al., 2002)
(Figure 7g,h). In response, we observed a significant reduction in [Cl�]i compared with baseline in

or AM-251 (n = 9) prevents the changes in RGC Cl� levels. (g) With synaptic activity blocked using a cocktail containing DNQX, AP-4, picrotoxin,
strychnine, and TTX, the ratio of CFP/YFP fluorescence in RGCs (n = 14), but not amacrine cells (n = 15), still is decreased in response to WIN 55,212-2

ment with AM-251 (Figure 7j, n = 17, p=0.903). In contrast, we did not find any significant reduction
in [Cl�]i in amacrine (n = 19, p=0.903) or bipolar (n = 10, p=0.831) cells immediately following the
conditioning stimulation (Figure 7k). Taken together, these data show that CB1R activation can
occur naturally in the retina in response to sustained illumination in peripheral visual fields, and it
appears to increase the number of RGCs responding to test stimuli.

 Cannabinoid modulation of RGC firing impacts response properties in
higher visual areas
Having described a mechanism by which CB1R activation in the retina increases intrinsic excitability
of RGCs and mediates certain forms of visual response facilitation in the retina, we next assessed the
potential consequences of this phenomenon on visual processing in the brain. We first performed
amphotericin-perforated patch recordings of visually evoked synaptic potentials from neurons in the
optic tectum which receives direct RGC innervation – in this case, perforated-patch recording helps
maintain the quality of recordings during long recordings by preventing ’wash-out’ of the cell. Direct
electrical stimulation of RGCs through a glass-stimulating electrode placed in the ganglion cell layer
of the eye (Figure 8a) evoked a-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) recep-
tor-mediated retinotectal currents with latencies of about 5 ms in postsynaptic tectal neurons
clamped at �60 mV. Following bath application (perfusion over the entire tadpole) of WIN 55,212-2
(1 mM), peak amplitudes of retinal evoked EPSCs were significantly increased (Figure 8b,c; 151.9 ±
17.5% baseline, n = 11, p=0.0004). This increase in EPSC amplitude was dependent on CB1R activa-
tion, as it was blocked by the inverse agonist AM-251 (Figure 8c, n = 5, p=0.497). Increasing the
endogenous AEA concentration with URB597 similarly increased EPSC amplitude (Figure 8c, n = 7,
p=0.029). Treatments with either N-arachidonyl maleimide (NAM, 150 nM, n = 7, p=0.988) or
JZL184 (100 nM, n = 7, p=0.999), two selective inhibitors of monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL), the 2-
AG degrading enzyme, showed no enhancement (Figure 8—figure supplement 1a), providing fur-
ther evidence that AEA is likely to be the endogenous cannabinoid that mediates the augmentation
of the response to retinal stimulation. The WIN 55,212-2-induced enhancement of retinotectal EPSC
amplitudes were blocked by strychnine and bumetanide (Figure 8—figure supplement 1b), mirror-
ing their effects on RGCs recorded in the isolated retinal eyecup (Figure 4e–h) and suggesting that
the changes in RGC excitability probably underlie the enhanced retinotectal responses to stimulation
in the eye.
To determine whether CB1R agonist perfusion was enhancing responses through action in the
eye or in the tectum, we used an isolated brain preparation in which the eyes were no longer present
and instead stimulated the severed RGC axons in the optic tract directly using a bipolar-stimulating
electrode (Wu et al., 1996). The difference in the peak amplitude before and after WIN 55,212-2
application could no longer be detected (Figure 8d, 100 ± 11% baseline, n = 7, p=0.999). This indi-
cates that the cannabinoid-mediated enhancement of retinotectal EPSC amplitude is due to
increased retinal excitability and the resulting recruitment of more RGCs when stimulating in the
eye, rather than to changes at the retinotectal synapses or in properties of the neurons within the
optic tectum (Figure 8—figure supplement 1c–h).
Taken together, these data suggest a model in which activation of CB1Rs on RGCs should
enhance their excitability enough to recruit RGCs to fire action potentials in response to visual stimu-
lation of subfields that were previously sub-threshold. This should manifest as an enlargement of
input receptive field (RF) sizes in tectal neurons, which receive convergent inputs from many RGCs.
To test this prediction, we examined whether RFs of tectal neurons were expanded by WIN 55,212-2
treatment. Immediately after establishing stable in vivoamphotericin-perforated patches onto tectal
neurons in intact tadpoles, the objective of the electrophysiology microscope was reoriented to proj-
ect a 7 � 7 grid of rectangular subfields directly onto the photoreceptor layer of the eye contralat-
eral to the cell being recorded. Each subfield was then repeatedly stimulated in random sequence
with a light-OFF stimulus while recording compound synaptic currents from tectal cells held at �60
mV (Engert et al., 2002; Tao and Poo, 2005) (Figure 8e). An example of one RF mapping experi-
ment is shown in Figure 8f–g. WIN 55,212-2 application produced a significant increase in tectal RF
size (127.6 ± 9.4% baseline, n = 5, p=0.042, one-sample t-test) and in the total charge evoked (140.3
± 14.2% baseline, n = 5, p=0.047) across all responsive subfields (Figure 8f–h). These results show
that activation of retinal CB1Rs increases the size and strength of tectal RFs, most likely through the
recruitment of responses from initially subthreshold RGC inputs.
CB1R activation impacts visually driven behavior
To determine whether the enhancement of visual responses by CB1R activation could contribute
meaningfully to vision, we exploited the instinctive avoidance of dark moving dots by freely swim-
ming tadpoles (Dong et al., 2009). We created video-tracking software to automatically track

 tadpole and dot movements and quantify escape responses over a range of brightness and contrast
conditions in control or drug-containing media. Videos of up to 8 animals at a time, swimming in a
Petri dish positioned over a computer monitor were collected for each trial (Figure 8i,j, Video 1). A
potential dot avoidance event was counted whenever a moving dot came within 5 mm of a tadpole.
A successful avoidance event was logged whenever swimming velocity changed by at least 24 mm
s�1 within 0.25 s of initial encounter. During an initial 3 min pre-test period, a uniform field was dis-
played to calculate false-positive response probabilities for the tadpoles by measuring escape
’responses’ to ’invisible dots’ presented by the software as isoluminant to background, and during
the subsequent 5 min test period, dots (4 mm diameter) with lower luminance than the background,
moving in random directions were displayed on the monitor while the software tracked each tadpole
for escape responses (Figure 8j). Importantly, WIN 55,212-2 treatment did not impair basic motor
coordination. The mean velocities of swimming tadpoles when not interacting with dots was indistin-
guishable between control and WIN 55,212-2-treated groups, indicating that the drug did not alter
the rhythms or coordination underlying swimming behavior (Figure 8k, n = 24, p=0.491, two-way
RM ANOVA with Holm-Sidak posttest). However, we did find that WIN 55,212-2-treated tadpoles
swam significantly faster when executing escape behaviors (n = 24, p<0.001), highlighting the caveat
that higher-order circuitry was likely also affected
by the drug treatments.
To compare visual contrast sensitivity of con-
trol tadpoles versus tadpoles treated with WIN
55,212-2, we measured their relative frequencies
of dot avoidance reactions to dots of different
luminances relative to background. When dark
dots were presented under photopic conditions
(overall luminance of the field = 190 cd m�2),
control tadpoles and WIN 55,212-2-treated tad-
poles did not differ in their avoidance response
rates to dots having a luminance 190, 150 and
90 cd m�2 darker than background. All elicited

 significantly more escapes than the false-positive rate measured during the pre-test periods. The
faintest dots, which differed from background by only 16 cd m�2, did not elicit a significant reaction
(Figure 8l). Under mesopic light conditions (overall luminance of the field = 0.65 cd m�2) control ani-
mals responded only at chance levels to all stimuli tested. Remarkably, WIN 55,212-2-treated tad-
poles successfully avoided a significant fraction of dots with luminance differences to the
background as small as 0.22 cd m�2 (Figure 8m, n = 24, p=0.003, Videos 2 and 3). Furthermore,
tadpoles treated with URB597 to elevate endogenous cannabinoid levels also showed significantly
enhanced dot avoidance compared to untreated controls (Figure 8n, n = 24, p<0.001). The effects
of URB597 were abolished by the CB1R inverse agonist AM-251 (5 mM), indicating that the drug was
indeed acting by elevating endogenous cannabinoids (n = 24, p<0.001).
These results demonstrate that endogenous AEA acting on CB1Rs is able to enhance visual con-
trast sensitivity. Although our observation of increased escape velocities suggests that the effects of
WIN 55,212-2 were not limited to the retina, the finding that drug-treated tadpoles exhibited supe-
rior detection of mesopic, but not photopic, visual stimuli, strongly argues for a retinal site of action.
It is therefore highly likely that the enhanced excitability of RGCs by CB1R activation which we first
report here, also contributes to this remarkable improvement in the visual detection of dim objects.
Discussion
We found that activation of CB1Rs on RGCs reduces [Cl�]i, through the AMPK-dependent inhibition
of NKCC1. This results in the hyperpolarization of the RGC resting membrane potential by enhanc-
ing the driving force for Cl� currents through GlyRs, and acutely enhances the intrinsic excitability of
the RGCs, most likely through the resultant de-inactivation of voltage-gated sodium channels. This
enhancement in RGC intrinsic excitability leads to the recruitment of additional, initially subthreshold
RGC responses by target neurons in the optic tectum, which in turn may contribute to improved
visual contrast sensitivity.
CB1Rs constitute one of the most highly expressed G-protein-coupled receptors in the central
nervous system (Herkenham et al., 1990), where they generally have been reported to act to
reduce neurotransmitter release by attenuating voltage-dependent Ca2+ or K+ conductances in pre-
synaptic terminals (Chevaleyre et al., 2006; Kano et al., 2009; Piomelli, 2003). CB1R-mediated
hyperpolarization has also been proposed to reduce intrinsic excitability in cerebellar and cortical
interneurons by positive modulation of a K+ conductance (Bacci et al., 2004; Kreitzer et al., 2002).
Our work presents a novel mechanism for interaction between glycinergic inhibition and the eCB sys-
tem involving the regulation of Cl� homeostasis, to enhance intrinsic neuronal excitability.
This finding also importantly adds to our understanding of the role of chloride transporter regula-
tion in neuronal physiology. In neurons, Cl� levels are primarily controlled by the interplay of the
inward NKCC1 and outward KCC2 cation-Cl� co-transporters, which are modulated by phosphoryla-
tion (Darman et al., 2001; de Los Heros et al., 2006; Delpire and Austin, 2010; Garzo
´n-
Muvdi et al., 2007; Rinehart et al., 2009; Song et al., 2002; Wenz et al., 2009). Activation of
human NKCC1 requires phosphorylation at T217 by SPAK family members downstream of WNK1
(Darman et al., 2001; Vitari et al., 2006). It had previously been reported that AMPK activation can
result in the inhibition of human NKCC1 through phosphorylation at S77, as well as suppression of
T217 phosphorylation by SPAK (Fraser et al., 2014). In our study, we have provided evidence that

 CB1R-mediated down-regulation of [Cl�]i. in RGCs is dependent upon the AMPK pathway.
We used Clomeleon imaging and a variety of electrophysiological methods to demonstrate the
reduction of [Cl�]i at the cell soma, and further found that Cl� currents through GlyRs appear to par-
ticipate in the regulation of resting membrane voltage and cell excitability, presumably through tonic
inhibition. Although tonic glycinergic inhibition has been well studied in the spinal cord and hippo-
campus (Xu and Gong, 2010), our study is one of the first to suggest a role for tonic inhibition by
strychnine-sensitive GlyRs in the retina. We also found evidence from calcium imaging of bipolar cell
terminals for their regulation by cannabinoid signaling (Figure 3b–e) and observed that synaptic
excitation and inhibition evoked by visual stimuli are reduced in response to CB1R activation
(Figure 3m–p). While a reduction in synaptic inhibition could potentially contribute to the cannabi-
noid-dependent enhancement of RGC firing that we detected, it is unlikely to fully account for this
phenomenon for three reasons. First, the primary effect that we observed was a specific decrease in
RGC [Cl]i leading to membrane hyperpolarization. This should enhance inhibitory driving force rather
than decrease it and therefore is more consistent with our model that tonic pre-hyperpolarization
helps prime the cell to fire more robustly to subsequent depolarization, which we demonstrated can
occur in RGCs (Figure 6j,k). Second, the fact that direct, instantaneous electrical stimulation of
RGCs with an electrode in the RGC layer, which entirely bypasses upstream retinal circuitry, still
resulted in a strychnine-sensitive enhancement of retinotectal EPSCs by CB1R activation is strongly
indicative of direct tonic changes in RGC excitability. Third, when measuring evoked firing rates of
RGCs, we did not find that pharmacological blockade of GABA-A receptors or GlyRs increased the
excitability of RGCs. To the contrary, the fact that inhibition of NKCC1 or blockade of GlyRs
completely eliminated the CB1R-dependent enhancement of RGC firing rates, taken together with
Clomeleon imaging data showing that [Cl�]i is selectively altered in RGCs argues that direct, cell-
autonomous changes in RGC excitability rather than modulation of upstream synaptic transmission
constituted the primary mechanism underlying the increased firing in response to visual stimulation.
The CB1R-mediated reduction of Ca2+ in bipolar cell terminals seems more likely to impact vision by
attenuating the signal from the outer retina to RGCs as has been well-documented in other species
(Middleton and Protti, 2011; Straiker et al., 1999; Yazulla et al., 2000).
Additionally, GlyRs have been reported to be directly positively modulated by cannabinoids
(Lozovaya et al., 2005). The change in slope of the EGly I-V curve upon WIN 55,212-2 perfusion,
apparent in Figure 6e, may provide further support for this idea. GlyR modulation could act syner-
gistically with the augmentation of tonic inhibition via the changes in [Cl�]i that we demonstrated to
enhance intrinsic excitability of RGCs. On the other hand, it would counter any mechanism that
relied on synaptic disinhibition. A direct enhancement of GlyRs by cannabinoids might account for
why strychnine, but not gabazine, was most effective at preventing the effects of WIN 55,212-2 on
RGC excitability.
Cannabinoid regulation of RGC-firing properties is not entirely unprecedented. Suppression of
HVA Ca2+ currents has been reported in dissociated rat RGCs (Lalonde et al., 2006). Interestingly,
RGCs are known to express both the synthetic (NAPE-PLD) and degradative (FAAH) enzymes for
AEA (Maione et al., 2009; Yazulla et al., 1999), suggesting they also may be a source of eCBs. In
support of this idea, the CB1R-dependent reduction in synaptic drive from bipolar and amacrine
interneurons can be induced by direct RGC membrane depolarization (Wang et al., 2016). Based on
our present data, we propose that AEA release additionally acts in an auto- or paracrine manner to
enhance RGC excitability. Opposing actions on bipolar cell terminals and RGCs may serve a useful
role to improve the signal-to-noise ratio of visual responses by maintaining a vigorous retinal output
while attenuating excessive synaptic noise from the outer retina (Grimes et al., 2014). This may
explain our finding that CB1R activation dramatically improved behavioral responses to dark moving
cues near absolute threshold for visual detection.
Finally, our work describes a mechanism of sensitization to spatial subfield stimulation when a
conditioning stimulus is presented in the periphery. This is reminiscent of the so-called ‘Westheimer
effect’ where detection sensitivity for a small test flash at the center of a background disk improves
as the background disk increases in size, an effect shown in humans (Westheimer, 1965) and lower
vertebrates (Burkhardt, 1974). The sensitization component of this effect generally has been
explained based on the antagonistic center and surround regions of the RGC RF, such that progres-
sive stimulation in the surround decreases net excitation. However, important limitations to this
model exist (Essock et al., 1985; Sinai et al., 1999) and recent research has revealed that

 sensitization to temporal contrast changes can last for seconds in individual regions of the RGC sur-
round field and may therefore mediate a predictive function (Kastner and Baccus, 2013). The
CB1R-dependent sensitization of mesopic RGC responses that we report here can persist for
minutes, but appears to require prolonged stimulation in the periphery to produce the eCBs that
induce it. This mechanism may be beneficial as a means of optimizing RGC signal-to-noise ratios dur-
ing the initial period of dark adaptation before photoreceptors obtain maximum sensitivity.
The CB1R-dependent mechanism for low luminance sensitization that we describe here in the
developing amphibian retina will require additional investigation to determine whether it also occurs
in the mammalian eye, although the psychophysical evidence is encouraging (Russo et al., 2004;
West, 1991). Our findings offer a new framework for future studies of contrast gain control in the
retina and generally expand our understanding of the diverse mechanisms of neuromodulation by
eCBs.
Materials and methods
Animals
Albino Xenopus laevis tadpoles (RRID:NXR_0.0082) were bred by human chorionic gonadotropin-
induced mating. Embryos were reared in a biological oxygen demand incubator (VWR) at 21C in
standard modified Barth’s saline with HEPES (MBSH) in a 12 hr:12 hr light-dark cycle. Experiments
were performed during the light period. All experiments were approved by the Montreal Neurologi-
cal Institute Animal Care Committee in accordance with Canadian Council on Animal Care guide-
lines. Tadpoles were developmentally staged according to the standard criteria of Nieuwkoop and
Faber (Nieuwkoop and Faber, 1994).
Immunohistochemistry
For cryostat sections, stage 42–45 tadpoles were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate
buffer and then cryoprotected overnight at 4C in 30% sucrose (Sigma, St. Louis, MO), after which
they were transferred to Tissue-Tek O.C.T. Compound (PELCO International, Redding, CA) for
20 mm sectioning. Sections were permeabilized (0.3% triton X-100, Sigma) and incubated in blocking
solution containing 5% normal goat serum (Gibco, Grand Island, NY), 10% bovine serum albumin
and 0.3% triton X-100 for 1 hr followed by application of primary antibody for 2 hr. CB1Rs were
labeled using a rabbit antibody (RRID:AB_2314112) against the N terminal of the CBR1R (1/100, a
generous gift of Dr. Ken Mackie) (Cesa et al., 2001), RGCs were electroporated with EGFP and
labeled using a chicken polyclonal GFP antibody (RRID:AB_300798, 1/500, Abcam, Cambridge, MA).
Secondary antibodies were conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488 (RRID:AB_142924) or 555 (RRID:AB_
2535849) (Invitrogen) and applied for 1 hr. For all immunolabeling, control experiments omitting the
primary antibody were performed. We also controlled for the specificity of the primary antibody by
co-application of a blocking peptide provided by Dr. Ken Mackie. Slides were then rinsed in phos-
phate buffer and coverslipped in Vectashield Mounting Medium with DAPI nuclear stain (Vector Lab-
oratories, Burlingame, CA). Sections were imaged on a Zeiss LSM 710 inverted confocal microscope.
Drugs
The following drugs were used in the experiments reported here: WIN55,212–2 (1 mM), ACEA, (1
mM) AM251 (5 mM), URB597 (2 mM), JZL184 (100 nM), N-Arachidonyl Maleimide (NAM, 150 nM),
from Cayman Chemicals (Ann Arbor, MI); Strychnine HCl (60 mM), and Bumetanide (10 mM) from
Sigma Aldrich; Gabazine (SR95531; 6 mM), D-APV (50 mM), L-AP4 (50 mM), DNQX (20 mM), picrotoxin
(100 mM) and glycine from Tocris (Minneapolis, MN); and TTX (1 mM) from Alomone Labs (Israel).
Electroporation
Cells in the retina were bulk electroporated as described (Ruthazer et al., 2006). Cells were imaged
roughly 48 hr after electroporation. In brief, glass micropipettes were made from borosilicate
capillaries pulled on a PC-10 puller (Narishige, East Meadow, NY). Pipette were loaded with plasmid
solution and attached to a custom-made pressure injection system. Plasmid solution (0.5–5 mg/mL)
was then pressure-injected in the eye, without visibly distending the eye, and current was delivered

placed in parallel.
In vivo imaging of GCaMP6s
Stage-40 tadpoles were electroporated in the retina with plasmid DNA encoding GCaMP6s and
given at least 24 hr to express the protein. Stage 42–45 tadpoles were immobilized by bath applica-
tion of pancuronium bromide (2 mM, Sigma) and placed in a custom-made imaging chamber, eye
facing up with the surrounding skin gently nicked for drug permeability. Tadpoles expressing the
construct in bipolar cells were selected for further in vivo two-photon microscopy using a Thorlabs
multiphoton imaging system with resonant scanner and Olympus 20x 1.0 NA immersion objective
(Thorlabs, Newton, NJ). A MaiTai-BB Ti:sapphire femtosecond pulsed laser (Spectra Physics, Santa
Clara, CA)set at 910 nm was used for fluorescence excitation. For visual stimulation, an A310 Accu-
pulser (WPI, Sarasota, FL) was used to drive a red LED (627 nm, rebel red Luxeon Star) to present
trains of light flashes (ON for 1 s, every 10 s). To visualize GCaMP6s fluorescence intensity changes
together with light stimulation, XYT series images of the retina were acquired at 10 Hz for 2 min
before and 5 min after WIN-55,212-2 (1 mM) application. Images were acquired on a PC using Thor-
Image LS software and subsequently analyzed using ImageJ (NIH). Regions of interest (ROI) were
drawn manually around visually identifiable bipolar terminals, and the mean intensity of the ROIs in
the green channel was determined for each frame of the XZT series. The background intensity was
measuring by calculating the mean intensity of a large ROI in an area free of any fluorescence, and
subtracted for each frame from the intensity of the ROI of bipolar cell terminals. F0 was calculated as
an average of the (ROI intensity – background intensity) for the initial 20 frames before the begin-
ning of light stimulation. The change in fluorescence was reported as 4F/F0, where 4F = F(t) – F0.
In vivo imaging of clomeleon
Stage-40 tadpoles were retinally electroporated with a construct encoding a modified Clomeleon
and given at least 24 hr to express the protein. Stage 42–45 tadpoles were immobilized by a pres-
sure injection of tubocurarine (1 mM) in the tail and placed in a custom-made imaging chamber, eye
facing up with the surrounding skin gently nicked to ensure drug permeability. In vivo two-photon
microscopy of retinal cells was performed using a Olympus FV300 confocal microscope custom-con-
verted for multiphoton imaging equipped with a MaiTai-BB Ti:sapphire femtosecond pulsed laser
set to excite at 860 nm. To visualize clomeleon fluorescence intensity changes, XYZT series images
of the retina were acquired simultaneously on CFP and YFP channels every 2 min. After a first
10 min of baseline imaging, another 10 min of imaging followed, during which various drugs were
applied. Images were acquired on a PC using Fluoview software and subsequently analyzed using
Image J (NIH). Bleed-through correction (PixFRET plugin [Feige et al., 2005]) from the CFP signal to
the YFP channel, and background subtraction were performed prior to calculating cyan:yellow inten-
sity ratios. Contol experiments using a chloride-insensitive mutant Clomeleon-M69Q demonstrated
that the fluorescence intensity changes indeed reflected [Cl�]i rather than any potential residual pH
sensitivity of the YFP.
Electroretinogram recordings
Stage 42–45 tadpoles were anesthetized in MBSH containing 0.02% MS222 (Sigma) for dissection.
The eye was removed using a 30 ga needle. For recording, the eye was gently laid on top of a filter
paper supplied with a constant flow of fresh external solution at room temperature. External solution
consisted of (in mM): NaCl, 115; KCl, 2; HEPES, 10; CaCl2, 3; MgCl2, 1.5; glucose, 10; glycine, 0.005
(pH 7.3). ERGs were recorded by placing a borosilicate glass patch electrode (O.D.:1.5 mm, O.D.:
0.86 mm, 10 cm length, Sutter Instrument) filled with 1 M NaCl with a tip diameter of 2–6 mm under
the lens on the surface of the retina using an anterior transscleral approach. A stable ERG recording
was typically achieved immediately. The isolated eye was placed with the cornea facing up few centi-
meters away from a full-field LED screen light source (light-ON stimulation = 10 s OFF followed by
0.5 s ON; light-OFF stimulation = 10 s ON followed by 0.5 s OFF). ERGs were amplified using an
extracellular amplifier (A-M Systems 1800, Sequim, WA) set to 1000x gain, and low-pass filtered at
300 Hz. The ERG traces and action potentials were analyzed by using custom-written software in
IGOR Pro (WaveMetrics). ERG recordings were verified by application of L-AP4 (50 mM), which

 selectively blocks transmission between photoreceptors and ON-bipolar cells in the retina, and fully
suppressed the b-wave as expected (Figure 2—figure supplement 1).
Ganglion cell recordings
Recordings of visually evoked spiking in the retina used the same preparation as described for ERG
recordings. Because RGCs are the dominant spiking cells of the retina (along with AII amacrine
cells) (Boos et al., 1993), we consider our spike recordings to reflect mainly RGC activity. After a cell
was found, a period of 10 min was given to confirm the stability of the recording. The amplifier was
set to filter 300 Hz–1 kHz. The spike traces were analyzed using custom-written software in IGOR
Pro. To drive RGCs spiking, we either used full-field flash, as described in the ERG recordings sec-
tion, or a complex stimulation designed to sensitize RGC responses through a light conditioning
protocol.
For this stimulation, we displayed subfield OFF-flash in the center (1 s. light-OFF flash every 10 s.,
light OFF luminance of 0.61 ± 0.09 cd.m�2) with a steady ON- or OFF-surround (100 s. OFF, fol-
lowed by 100 s. ON, and back to 100 s. OFF). The light ON luminance was 15.56 ± 2.80 cd.m�2. We
compared the spiking responses between the first and second OFF-surround periods, evoked by 10
successive OFF-centered flashes, and described the central period of ON-surround as the condition-
ing part of the light stimulation protocol.
For whole-cell RGC recording of synaptic currents, the recording pipettes were filled with an
internal solution containing (in mM): K-gluconate, 100; KCl, 8 NaCl, 5; MgCl2, 1.5; EGTA, 0.5;
HEPES, 20; ATP, 2; GTP, 0.3 (mOsm 255; pH 7.3). External solution contained (in mM): NaCl, 115;
KCl, 4; HEPES, 5; CaCl2, 3; MgCl2, 3; glucose, 10 (mOsm 255, pH 7.3). To drive the responses to
light in voltage clamp mode, RGCs were held successively at �65 mV (to record EPSCs) and 0 mV
(to record IPSCs), and stimulated using a red LED (627 nm, rebel red Luxeon Star) to present trains
of light flashes (ON for 3 s, every 8 s). Each measurement was made 10 times per cell.
EGly was calculated from peak amplitudes of glycine-induced IPSCs recorded at different com-
mand potentials (from �80 to +10 mV with step increments of +10 mV) as an intersection between
the x-axis and the fit of the observed amplitudes. Glycine (500 mM) was puffed every 30 s (30 psi for
5–20 ms) through a patch pipette connected to a Picospritzer (Parker Instrumentation, Canada). For
each cell, the EGly measurement protocol was repeated twice before and after drug application.
Dissociated retinal cell culture
For each culture, retinae were dissected in disaggregation solution (115 mM NaCl, 4 mM KCl, 5 mM
HEPES, 10 mM glucose, pH 7.3, osmolarity at 250 mOsmol) containing 0.02% MS222 anesthetic,
and then incubated for 8 min at room temperature in a papain solution (10 U/mL) in disaggregation
solution, containing 0.4% DNase, and L-cystein HCl (1.26 mM). Retinae were then triturated in LO-
Ovomucoid solution (115 mM NaCl, 4 mM KCl, 5 mM HEPES, 10 mM glucose, 3 mM CaCl2, 3 mM
MgCl2, 10% BSA, 1.15 mg/mL trypsin inhibitor from soybean, pH 7.3), and spun 11 min at 200 �g at
room temperature. The supernatant was removed and retinae were resuspended in reaggregation
solution (115 mM NaCl, 4 mM KCl, 5 mM HEPES, 10 mM glucose, 3 mM CaCl2, 3 mM MgCl2, pH
7.3), and seeded on poly-D-lysine (>300,000 kDa) treated coverslips (10 retinae/coverslip).
Gramicidin perforated patch recordings from cultured RGCs
After 18–24 hr in culture, dissociated retinal cells (as described above) from the Isl2b:GFP
line (Boos et al., 1993) were gently transferred to the recording chamber, which was constantly per-
fused at low rate with fresh external solution containing (in mM): NaCl, 115; KCl, 4; HEPES, 5; CaCl2,
3; MgCl2, 3; glucose, 10 (mOsm 255, pH 7.3). Only GFP-positive cells that were well attached to the
coverslip and that had already grown several neurites were used for recordings. Gramicidin-perfo-
rated patch recordings were performed as previously described (Khakhalin and Aizenman, 2012).
Borosilicate glass micropipettes (Sutter Instruments), with a resistance of 8–12 MOhms were briefly
dipped in gramicidin-free internal solution, and then back-filled with internal solution containing (in
mM): Kgluconate, 100; KCl, 8; NaCl, 5; MgCl2, 1.5; EGTA, 10; HEPES, 20; ATP, 2; GTP, 0.3 (mOsm
255; pH 7.3) supplemented with gramicidin 20 mg/ml (Sigma). To prevent gramicidin spillover, no
positive pressure was applied to the tip of the pipette while approaching the cells. Recordings were

 usually possible 10–20 min after successful formation of the gigaseal. Membrane potentials were not
corrected for liquid junction potentials.
In vivo tectal cell recordings
Stage 42–45 tadpoles were anesthetized in MBSH containing 0.02% MS222 (Sigma) for dissection.
The lens was gently removed from one eye to expose the retina. The skin on the head was cut, and
the brain was opened along the midline for tectal recording. For recordings, the tadpole was fixed
to a PDMS insert in the recording chamber with insect pins. The tadpole was constantly perfused
with fresh external solution, and all experiments were performed at the room temperature. External
solution consisted of (in mM): NaCl, 115; KCl, 2; HEPES, 10; CaCl2, 3; MgCl2, 1.5; glucose, 10; gly-
cine, 0.005 (pH 7.3). Amphotericin B perforated-patch recording, which avoids rundown sometimes
encountered with whole-cell recording, was performed as previously described (Tsui et al., 2010;
Zhang et al., 2000). Borosilicate glass micropipettes (Warner, Hamden, CT), with a resistance in the
range of 4–7 MOhm were briefly dipped in internal solution, and then back-filled with internal solu-
tion containing amphotericin B (250 mg ml�1). The internal solution contained (in mM): Kgluconate,
110; KCl, 10; NaCl, 5; MgCl2, 1.5; EGTA, 0.5; HEPES, 20; ATP, 2; GTP, 0.3 (pH 7.3). The same size
patch pipette was used for extracellular RGC stimulation except that it was filled with external solu-
tion. For optic chiasm stimulation experiments, the brain was dissected out into external solution, fil-
leted flat by transecting the dorsal midline and pinned to a Sylgard base in a recording perfusion
chamber. A custom-bent 25 mm cluster electrode (FHC, Maine) was positioned onto the optic chi-
asm through which constant current electrical stimulation was delivered using a stimulus isolation
unit (AMPI, Israel). Test pulses to evoke retinotectal EPSCs were applied every 30 s in voltage clamp.
Recordings were acquired with a patch-clamp amplifier (Axopatch 200B; Molecular Devices, Sunny-
vale, CA) and Clampex software (Molecular Devices). Signals were filtered at 2 kHz and sampled at 5
kHz. Input resistance (0.5–1 GOhm) and series resistance (30–70 MOhm) were monitored continu-
ously during recordings. Data were accepted for analysis only if the series resistance and input resis-
tance remained relatively constant (<20% change) throughout the experiment. Cells were held at a
holding potential of �60 mV. To measure visual receptive fields of tectal neurons, visual stimuli were

(eMagin, Hopewell Junction, NY) mounted in place of one microscope eyepiece using a custom built
frame. The image was then focused onto the photoreceptor layer of the retina through the micro-
scope objective. The screen displayed a 7 � 7 pixel array, each pixel (30 mm square) of which inde-
pendently turned off for 200 ms in random order at 0.067 Hz to drive receptive field OFF
stimulation. Total charge transferred in the 200 ms window following each stimulus presentation was
used to calculate input strength for the corresponding part of the visual field.
Behavior
Stage 44–45 tadpoles were placed in MBSH solution in a polystyrene Petri dish (100 � 15 mm) posi-
tioned directly over a 22 in computer monitor (ViewSonic 1080 Full HD, 10 M:1 contrast ratio), which
lay horizontally within a darkened box. For each experiment, eight animals at a time were filmed
using a digital camcorder (SONY HDR-CX250B), while the screen displayed dark moving dot stimuli
(10 mm dia., 2 cm s�1) following a ballistic random walker trajectory (Molina
`s-Mata et al., 1996). A
pre-test period of 3 min, with dots having the same luminance as the background (invisible dots)
was used to establish the frequency of random chance false positive dot avoidance behaviors. Dur-
ing the test period, lasting 5 min, the screen displayed either a white background of high intensity
(photopic, 190 ± 4.2 cd m�2) or of low intensity (mesopic, 0.65 ± 0.05 cd m�2), with dark dots of dif-
ferent luminances for each trial. Custom MATLAB ’Tadtracker’ code (available for download at
http://ruthazerlab.mcgill.ca/local.htm) was created to track each tadpole independently in the
recorded videos and measure their reactions by correlating their locations, relative to the dots, with
changes in their swimming speed to the dot coordinates. Tadpole positions were calculated based
on image contrast to background with the software always identifying the eight objects fitting the
criteria for a tadpole based on size and interpolation of previous and subsequent positions, and
excluding the positions of known moving dot stimuli. Velocities were measured between each frame
at 30 Hz video rate and then Gaussian smoothed to reduce the effects of noise on the tracking. A
potential dot avoidance event was counted whenever a dot came within 5 mm of a tadpole. A

 successful avoidance event was logged if swimming velocity changed by at least 24 mm s�1 within
0.25 s of initial encounter. This threshold was determined empirically based on the acquisition
frame-rate and baseline rates of tadpole movement as one which unambiguously constituted a reac-
tion to the visual environment. We noted that histograms of tadpole swimming speeds showed a
dual power law distribution ranging from 0 to 200 mm s�1 with a critical point at 24 mm s�1.
Western blot for pNKCC1 and pSPAK
To analyze the changes in NKCC1 and SPAK phosphorylation, samples were prepared of stage 42–
45 Xenopus laevis tadpole eyes. Eyes were homogenized in the extraction buffer (10 mM HEPES/
NaOH pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA pH 8.0, 1% NP40) with protease inhibitors (Calbiochem
Protease inhibitor Set V, EDTA-free). Western blot analysis for NKCC1 phosphorylation was per-
formed with Biorad wet transfer system and PVDF membrane, using the primary sheep polyclonal
anti-human antibody against Thr phosphorylation sites 212, 217 of NKCC1 (MRC-PPU Reagents,
antibody S063D). S063D was used at 0.5 mg/ml in 2% milk-TBS with 0.05% Tween, and before apply-
ing it to the blot, 30 min pre-incubation with 5 mg/ml of non-phosphorylated epitope peptide was
performed, as per the recommendations of the manufacturer to minimize the prevalence of the anti-
bodies in the polyclonal mix that react with the non-phosphorylated epitope. For total NKCC1 mea-
surement, sheep anti-Dog fish polyclonal antibody (S841B, MRC PPU Reagents) was used, 0.2 mg/ml
in 2.5% milk-PBS with 0.1% Triton. As a secondary antibody for S063D and S841B, Abcam rabbit
anti-sheep IgG-HRP (RRID:AB_955453) was used, 1:30 000 in 2% milk TBS-T. For detection of SPAK
phosphorylation, primary Millipore antibody 07–2273 p-SPAK Ser373/pOSR Ser325 (RRID:AB_
11205577) was used, 1:7000 in 5% BSA, and as a secondary antibody, goat anti-rabbit HRP (RRID:
AB_2307391), 1:30 000 in 5% milk TBS-tween. In all cases, blots were incubated in primary antibody
overnight at 4C. Secondary antibodies were incubated at room temperature for 1 hr. The blots were
developed with Immobilon Western Chemiluminescent HRP Substrate (WBKLS0500).
Analysis
All statistical analyses were performed using Prism 6.0 (GraphPad, RRID:SCR_002798) and all data
are reported and graphed as mean ± SEM. Data were tested for normality using a Shapiro-Wilk test
and outliers, as identified by Grubb’s test, were excluded from analysis. Correction for multiple com-
parisons following ANOVA were made using the Holm-Sidak post-hoc test with multiplicity cor-
rected p-values reported. For one-sample t-tests, we tested whether fold-change was significantly
different from one-fold (i.e. no change). Sample size in whole-cell recording experiments was based
on values previously found sufficient to detect significant changes in retinotectal synaptic strength in
past studies from the lab. For extracellular recordings, an N of 10 independent recordings from 10
animals was set in advance to provide sufficient statistical power while trying to minimize the number
of animals sacrificed. Behavioral studies and RGC recording experiments were not performed blind,
but analysis used automated software algorithms to present randomized stimuli and applied uniform
criteria to all samples, limiting potential bias.
