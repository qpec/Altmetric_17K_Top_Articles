Mice devoid of T, B, and natural killer (NK) cells distinguish between self and allogeneic nonself despite the ab-
sence of an adaptive immune system. When challenged with an allograft, they mount an innate response charac-
terized by accumulation of mature, monocyte-derived dendritic cells (DCs) that produce interleukin-12 and present 
antigen to T cells. However, the molecular mechanisms by which the innate immune system detects allogeneic 
nonself to generate these DCs are not known. To address this question, we studied the innate response of 
Rag2−/−c−/− mice, which lack T, B, and NK cells, to grafts from allogeneic donors. By positional cloning, we identi-
fied that donor polymorphism in the gene encoding signal regulatory protein  (SIRP) is a key modulator of the 
recipient’s innate allorecognition response. Donors that differed from the recipient in one or both Sirpa alleles 
elicited an innate alloresponse. The response was mediated by binding of donor SIRP to recipient CD47 and was 
modulated by the strength of the SIRP-CD47 interaction. Therefore, sensing SIRP polymorphism by CD47 pro-
vides a molecular mechanism by which the innate immune system distinguishes between self and allogeneic 
nonself independently of T, B, and NK cells.
INTRODUCTION
Recognition of allogeneic nonself by the mammalian immune system 
has been attributed to adaptive lymphoid cells that express rearranging 
receptors for antigen (T and B lymphocytes) or to natural killer (NK) 
cells that express nonrearranging receptors but are activated in response 
to “missing self” (1, 2). The principal alloantigens recognized by lym-
phocytes and NK cells are the polymorphic major histocompatibility 
complex (MHC) molecules widely expressed on bodily tissues. Trans-
plantation of tissues between MHC-mismatched individuals therefore 
triggers a potent lymphoid cell response that causes graft rejection.
Recent studies have shown that innate myeloid cells, which have 
elaborate systems for sensing microbial nonself, also engage in allo-
recognition (3). Upon encountering nonself cells or tissues trans-
planted from another individual, monocytes cause a delayed-type 
hypersensitivity–like reaction or differentiate into potent antigen- 
presenting dendritic cells (DCs) independently of T, B, and NK cells 
(4–6). In one model (5), heart allografts transplanted to Rag2−/−c−/− 
mice, which lack all lymphoid cells, were persistently infiltrated 
with mature monocyte-derived DCs (mono-DCs) that expressed 
interleukin-12 (IL-12) and stimulated both T cell proliferation and 
interferon- (IFN-) production (5). In contrast, syngeneic grafts in the 
same mice harbored a smaller number of mono-DCs transiently, and 
these DCs neither expressed IL-12 nor stimulated IFN- production by 
T cells. Only T cells activated by mono-DCs that were generated in re-
sponse to allogeneic nonself caused graft rejection (5). Furthermore, 
mono-DCs that accumulated in the graft directly contributed to rejec-
tion by propagating the local effector T cell response (7). Other studies 
have shown that macrophages also respond to allogeneic nonself. 
Macrophages from mice primed with allogeneic cells subsequently 
killed cells grafted from the same donor, although this allotoxic re-
sponse depended on CD4+ T lymphocyte help at the time of priming 
(8). Therefore, nonself sensing by innate myeloid cells is not restricted 
to microbes but extends to the recognition of allografts.
How monocytes or macrophages distinguish between self and 
allogeneic nonself is not known. Earlier studies suggested that acti-
vation of monocytes by allogeneic grafts is not dependent on MHC 
mismatch between donor and recipient but rather on mismatches 
elsewhere in the genome (4–6). This raised the possibility that ge-
netically defined non-MHC determinants on donor cells control the 
host’s innate alloresponse. Identifying these determinants would 
provide fundamental insights into innate immune recognition mecha-
nisms central to the transplant rejection and the maternal immune re-
sponse to the allogeneic fetus. We therefore embarked on a genetic 
mapping (positional cloning) study in the mouse that exploited dif-
ferences in the magnitude of the monocyte response elicited by allografts 
from congenic inbred donors. We report here that a key determinant 
of the innate immune response to allogeneic nonself is donor poly-
morphism in the immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF) membrane 
protein SIRP that is sensed by CD47 on recipient monocytes.
RESULTS
Magnitude of the host innate alloresponse is influenced by 
the genetic background of the donor
To explore the mechanisms by which the innate immune system 
senses allogeneic grafts, we tested the innate response of lymphoid 
cell–deficient mice to grafts from genetically disparate donors. Bone

marrow plugs from six common laboratory [DBA/2, nonobese diabetes- 
resistant (NOR), C3H, FVB, BALB/c, and nonobese diabetic (NOD)] 
and three wild-derived [Mus Pahari, Watkins Star Line B (WSB), and 
CAST] inbred mouse strains were transplanted individually under 
the kidney capsules of separate C57BL/B6 (B6) Rag2−/−c−/− (BRG) 
recipients. BRG mice are devoid of lymphoid cell lineages and lack 
known T, B, and NK cell–mediated allorecognition. Control BRG 
mice were transplanted with bone marrow plugs from syngeneic B6 
donors that were wild-type at the Rag2 and c loci. Plugs were re-
moved 1 week after transplantation, and the number of infiltrating 
host mono-DCs was quantified by flow cytometry as a measure of an 
innate alloresponse (fig. S1) (5). As shown in Fig. 1A, allogeneic grafts 
harbored significantly greater numbers of host mono-DCs than did 
syngeneic B6 grafts, with the largest mono-DC infiltrate observed in 
NOD allografts. In contrast, mono-DC infiltration of syngeneic NOD 
grafts transplanted to NOD.Rag2−/−c−/− (NRG) recipients was minimal 
(Fig. 1B), indicating that the robust mono-DC infiltrate observed in 
NOD allografts is a true measure of an innate alloresponse. We also 
tested the host response to allogeneic (NOR, BALB/c, or NOD) and 
syngeneic (B6) bone marrow plugs transplanted simultaneously in the 
contralateral kidneys of the same BRG recipient. NOR mice are a re-
combinant inbred strain that is 88% identical by descent to NOD, includ-
ing at the Mhc locus (9, 10). Allogeneic BALB/c, but not allogeneic 
NOR grafts, elicited greater mono-DC infiltration than syngeneic B6 
grafts (Fig. 1C). In addition, NOD grafts displayed a much larger mono-DC 
infiltrate than did either B6 or NOR grafts (Fig. 1C), confirming 
that NOD donor tissue induces a robust innate alloresponse. The 
difference between NOD and NOR allografts was also observed in 
BALB/c.Rag2−/−c−/− (CRG) recipients (Fig. 1D). Therefore, varying 
the genetic background of the donor modulates the host innate allo-
response, with NOD allografts inducing the strongest response, whereas 
allografts from the closely related NOR mouse inducing a weak 
response.
Innate alloresponse is determined by a single Mendelian 
locus in the donor not linked to the Mhc
To determine whether donor variables that influence the magnitude of 
the innate alloresponse are heritable, we crossed BRG and NRG mice 
and studied the response induced by F1 and F2 grafts transplanted to 
BRG recipients. As shown in Fig. 2A, grafts from F1 progeny induced 
an intermediate response (they were infiltrated with about half the 
number of host mono-DCs as NRG grafts), whereas responses elicited 
by F2 grafts segregated at a ~1:2:1 (7:15:8) ratio into weak (equivalent to 
BRG grafts), intermediate (equivalent to F1 grafts), and strong (equiv-
alent to NRG grafts), respectively. These outcomes are consistent 
with the inheritance of a single Mendelian locus at which alleles ex-
hibit an additive effect. Because all mice used in these experiments 
were on the Rag2−/−c−/− background, the results also confirmed 
our previous demonstration that the alloresponse is not dependent 
on lymphoid cells in either the donor or the recipient (5).
The fact that NOR and NOD grafts elicited distinctly different re-
sponses (Fig. 1), despite sharing the same Mhc locus (9, 10), suggested 
that the locus controlling the magnitude of the alloresponse is not 
linked to the Mhc. This is supported by experiments in which we 
transplanted bone marrow plugs from BALB.B (H-2b) donors into 
BRG (H-2b) recipients, a donor-host combination that is genetically 
identical at the Mhc but disparate at non-Mhc loci. BALB.B grafts 
exhibited significant mono-DC infiltration (Fig. 2B), comparable in 
magnitude to BALB/c grafts (Fig. 1, A and B). Conversely, grafts from 
B6.C mice, which carry a distinct Mhc haplotype (H-2d) but are identical 
at all other loci to BRG recipients, elicited a weaker response than did 
BALB.B grafts (Fig. 2B), comparable with that of B6 grafts (Fig. 1). There-
fore, mismatches at non-Mhc loci between donor and recipient are nec-
essary and sufficient to trigger the innate alloresponse. We also observed 
that the alloresponse was not diminished when bone marrow plugs 
were derived from MHC class I (MHC I) (2-microglobulin)–deficient 
(NOD.Prkdcscid.b2m−/−) mice (Fig. 2C) compared with grafts from sim-
ilarly lymphoid-deficient but MHC I–sufficient NRG mice (Fig. 2A). 
Similarly, MHC II expression was not required on the allografts be-
cause B6.Mhc2−/− and parental B6 allografts had equivalent mono-DC 
infiltration in CRG recipients (Fig. 2D). Thus, a single non-Mhc locus 
in the donor controls the magnitude of the innate alloresponse, and 
neither MHC disparity between donor and recipient nor expression 
of MHC I or MHC II molecules on graft is necessary for eliciting the 
response.

Innate alloresponse maps to a small genomic region in the 
donor containing the Sirpa gene
The conspicuous difference in mono-DC infiltration between NOD 
and NOR grafts (Fig. 1) provided the opportunity for fine genetic 
mapping of the innate alloresponse locus in the donor because of 
the availability of well-characterized NOD.NOR congenic mouse 
lines. NOD and NOR congenic mouse strains share about 88% ge-
netic identity but differ in their susceptibilities to autoimmune dia-
betes. Subcongenic lines generated by introgressing genetic intervals 
from NOR to NOD mice have enabled the mapping of important 
diabetes susceptibility and immune response traits in the NOD 
mouse (10–13). One example is the superiority of the immunodefi-
cient NOD.Prkdcscid mouse as host for human hematopoietic stem cells 
compared with equally immunodeficient NOR or B6 recipients. Ge-
netic control of this trait was due to polymorphism at the gene en-
coding SIRP in the recipient (14, 15). SIRP is an IgSF receptor 
expressed on myeloid cells, neurons, and other cell types (16, 17). 
SIRP engagement by its ubiquitously expressed monomorphic ligand 
CD47 delivers an inhibitory signal that represses phagocytosis by 
macrophages and inhibits multiple aspects of DC activation (18–20). 
In some contexts, CD47-SIRP signaling is bidirectional because 
SIRP binding to CD47 triggers stimulatory signals in T cells and 
neurons (12, 21, 22). We therefore took a genetic approach to test 
whether donor SIRP polymorphism controls the MHC-independent 
alloreactions we had observed. We used a series of congenic NOD 
strains carrying different NOR-derived genomic intervals of chro-
mosome 2 that did or did not contain Sirpa as bone marrow donors 
for BRG recipients (12, 14). Bone marrow plugs from NOD.NOR-Ila-
D2Gul482 (NOD.NOR-R7; referred to as R7) donors, which are iden-
tical to the parental NOD strain except for a ~2-megabyte segment 
that includes NOR-Sirpa (Fig. 3A), elicited an alloresponse in-
distinguishable from parental NOR grafts (Fig. 3B). In contrast, 
bone marrow from NOD.NOR-D2Gul169-D2Gul289 (NOD.NOR-R12; 
referred to as R12) mice that differ from the parental NOD strain 
in a different genomic segment compared with R7 and express the 
NOD- 
derived SIRP (Fig. 3A) phenocopied parental NOD donors 
(Fig. 3B). This result was confirmed by showing that NOD and R12 
bone marrow plugs transplanted into contralateral kidneys of the 
same BRG recipient displayed equivalent levels of mono-DC infil-
tration (Fig. 3C). Last, we transplanted grafts from a BRG donor 
strain that is congenic for the NOD-derived Sirpa allele (BRGS) (15) 
and observed that these bone marrow plugs stimulated an innate 
alloresponse equivalent to NRG donor tissue (Fig. 3D). Therefore, 
the capacity of donor tissue to induce a robust innate alloresponse, 
characterized by mono-DC infiltration of the graft, mapped to a very 
small region in the mouse genome that encodes the polymorphic 
Sirpa gene.
Donor SIRP binding to recipient CD47 is required for 
triggering the innate alloresponse
To determine whether the binding of SIRP on donor tissue to its 
ligand CD47 on recipient cells is necessary to elicit the innate allo-
response, we treated BRG recipients of NOD grafts with human 
CD47-Fc (hCD47-Fc), a fusion protein that binds NOD SIRP on 
graft cells with high affinity and prevents it from binding to its na-
tive ligand mouse CD47 (14). Compared with isotype control hu-
man IgG1 Fc (hIgG1 Fc) protein, hCD47-Fc treatment inhibited the 
accumulation of mono-DCs in NOD grafts (Fig. 4A). Moreover, BRG 
recipients carrying a targeted deficiency in Cd47 (BRG.Cd47−/−) (23) 
did not respond to either NOD or BALB/c grafts (Fig. 4B). These data 
establish that SIRP expressed on donor cells activates the host’s in-
nate alloresponse by engaging CD47.
We considered the possible confounder that donor SIRP bind-
ing to CD47 on recipient mono-DCs could inhibit the phagocytic 
function of donor myeloid cells in the bone marrow graft, indirectly 
influencing the number of infiltrating mono-DCs. To test this pos-
sibility, we transplanted bone marrow plugs from B6.Sirpatm1 mice 
with a targeted deletion of the cytoplasmic region of SIRP required 
for signaling (24). Allogeneic B6.Sirpatm1 bone marrow plugs trans-
planted to CRG recipients accumulated the same number of host 
mono-DCs as parental B6 grafts that express a full-length SIRP 
protein (Fig. 4C). This could not be explained by inherent hyperac-
tivity of cells in B6.Sirpatm1 bone marrow grafts because increased 
host mono-DC accumulation was not observed when these grafts were 
transplanted to syngeneic BRG mice (Fig. 4D). Therefore, eliminating

the intracellular signaling function of SIRP in donor cells did not 
influence the magnitude of the host innate alloresponse. We also ruled 
out the possibility that increased host mono-DC accumulation was 
an indirect consequence of donor monocyte activation by host cells 
(that is, a graft-versus-host reaction). As a measure of monocyte activa-
tion, we analyzed the maturation state of donor and host mono-DCs 
in NRG grafts transplanted to BRG mice. We found that only 2% of 
donor mono-DC had acquired a mature (MHCIIhiCD80+) pheno-
type compared with 52% of recipient mono-DCs (Fig. 4E). More-
over, the number of mature donor mono-DCs in NRG grafts did 
not exceed that in syngeneic BRG grafts (Fig. 4F). Therefore, the 
host innate alloresponse to bone marrow grafts is a consequence of 
donor SIRP binding to recipient CD47 and not the indirect result 
of a graft-versus-host reaction.
Mouse SIRP amino acid polymorphism modulates  
binding to CD47
The results presented so far support a model in which polymor-
phism in the extracellular domains of donor SIRP is recognized by 
host CD47 to identify cells as self or nonself. To test this model further, 
we investigated the extent and location of amino acid polymor-
phisms in mouse SIRP by aligning the predicted SIRP protein 
sequences from 19 different mouse strains whose genomes had been 
sequenced (www.sanger.ac.uk/science/data/mouse-genomes-project). We 
found that amino acid variability is largely restricted to the extracel-
lular region and is most frequent in the N-terminal, CD47-binding IgV 
domain (Fig. 5A; alignment is shown in fig. S2) (25–27). Phylogenetic 
analysis revealed four unique IgV domains among the 13 common in-
bred mouse strains examined, whereas each of the six wild-derived

mouse strains had its own unique IgV sequence (Fig. 5B). The latter 
suggests the presence of a considerable number of mouse SIRP alleles 
in the wild. We also observed that NOD and CAST strains, which 
elicited the strongest innate alloresponses in BRG mice (Fig. 1A), 
have closely related IgV domains, whereas NOR, which elicited a very 
weak alloresponse, shared the same IgV domain with B6 recipients 
(Fig. 5B and fig. S2). Because amino acid polymorphism in SIRP’s 
IgV domain influences binding to CD47 (12), we asked whether 
NOD and CAST SIRP variants share greater binding to CD47 than 
SIRP variants of mouse strains that induce weaker alloresponses. To 
answer this question, we compared the binding of mouse CD47-Fc 
(mCD47-Fc) fusion protein to splenic monocytes from NOD and 
CAST mice to that from B6, BALB/c, and C3H mice. Splenic mono-
cytes constitutively express high levels of SIRP (16). As shown in 
Fig. 5C, mCD47-Fc displayed greater binding to NOD and CAST 
cells than B6, BALB/c, and C3H cells at each concentration tested. 
SIRP expression was comparable on monocytes from all strains 
tested (Fig. 5D), indicating that dissimilarities in binding were not 
due to differences in SIRP cell surface density. The data therefore 
suggest that donor SIRP IgV domain polymorphism controls 
the host innate alloresponse by modulating the binding of SIRP 
to CD47.
Donor SIRP polymorphism modulates  
monocyte proliferation
To further investigate the role of SIRP polymorphism in monocyte 
activation, we immunized BRG mice with splenocytes from donors 
expressing SIRP variants with different CD47-binding affinities 
and analyzed the proliferation of myeloid cells in the spleen 7 days 
later. Mice were injected with 5-ethynyl-2′-deoxyuridine (EdU) 1 hour 
before spleen harvest to label dividing cells in situ. As shown in 
Fig. 6A, significant EdU uptake was observed only in Ly6Chi mono-
cytes (and to a much lesser extent, in mono-DCs) in mice immu-
nized with allogeneic, but not syngeneic, splenocytes. The magnitude 
of monocyte proliferation correlated 
with strength of SIRP binding to CD47. 
Splenocytes from NOD mice, which ex-
press a high-affinity variant of SIRP, 
induced the greatest proliferation; NOR 
splenocytes, which share the same lower- 
affinity SIRP allele with B6, induced 
the least; and BALB/c splenocytes gave 
an intermediate result (Fig. 6B). Mono-
cyte proliferation was makedly reduced 
in CD47-deficient recipients stimulated 
with NOD cells (Fig. 6B). Together, these 
data provide additional evidence that 
differential binding of donor SIRP to 
CD47 modulates monocyte activation.
Innate alloactivation is triggered 
by mismatch between donor  
and recipient SIRP
Because SIRP and CD47 are coexpressed 
on both donor and host cells, we tested 
the hypothesis that transplantation of 
allogeneic grafts carrying nonself SIRPa 
allele(s) causes innate immune activa-
tion by disturbing the balance between 
activating and inhibitory signals medi-
ated by CD47 and SIRP in host mono-
cytes, respectively. This hypothesis would 
predict that under steady-state conditions 
or upon transplantation of a syngeneic 
graft, bidirectional interactions between 
CD47 and self-SIRP are of equal affin-
ity and therefore maintain monocytes 
in a quiescent state (Fig. 7A, top). The data 
shown in Fig. 7B are consistent with the 
prediction as they demonstrate that syn-
geneic grafts lacking CD47 elicit robust 
mono-DC infiltration, comparable with 
that triggered by allogeneic grafts. In the 
case of allogeneic transplantation, on the 
other hand, the introduction of donor cells, 
which express a nonself SIRP variant

with greater binding to CD47 than recipient SIRP, would be expected 
to upset the balance and cause monocyte activation (Fig. 7A, bot-
tom). This is most evident in the case of NOD- and CAST-derived 
grafts, which express SIRP variants with greater binding to CD47 
than B6 SIRP (Fig. 5C) and elicit robust innate alloresponses in B6 
(BRG) mice (Fig. 1A). The hypothesis would also predict that per-
forming allogeneic transplantation in the opposite direction, such 
that donor SIRP has weaker binding to CD47 than recipient SIRP, 
should suppress the innate alloresponse. This prediction is borne out 
by the results shown in Fig. 7C: Mono-DC accumulation in BRG 
grafts transplanted to NRG recipients was significantly less than that in 
NRG grafts transplanted to BRG recipients. Therefore, the experi-
mental findings presented in this manuscript support a model in 
which the innate immune system senses allogeneic nonself by inte-
grating activating and inhibitory signals delivered by CD47 and SIRP, 
respectively.
DISCUSSION
We have identified a mechanism by which the innate immune sys-
tem distinguishes between self and allogeneic nonself that is distinct 
from allorecognition by T or NK cells. Unlike allorecognition by T 
cells, this innate mechanism is not linked to the Mhc and is not based 
on polymorphisms in both donor and recipient molecules. Instead, 
it is mediated by differential binding of a polymorphic ligand in the 
donor, SIRP, to a monomorphic receptor in the recipient, CD47. 
The SIRP-CD47 pathway resembles allorecognition by NK cells in 
that it relies on the integration of stimulatory and inhibitory signals 
by the responding cell (28) but differs from it in several aspects. First, 
monocytes use the same molecular pair (CD47 and SIRP) that en-
gages each other in opposite directions to deliver stimulatory and 
inhibitory signals, whereas NK cells rely 
on distinct sets of stimulatory and inhibi-
tory ligand-receptor pairs. Second, mono-
cytes sense allogeneic nonself through 
subtle variations in the binding of SIRP 
to CD47, whereas NK cells sense miss-
ing self-MHC molecules. Third, unlike 
NK cell allorecognition, the monocyte 
allorecognition mechanism elucidated 
here is not dependent on MHC mismatch 
between the donor and recipient but in-
stead on mismatch in a gene not linked 
to the MHC. Last, allorecognition systems 
that predate the evolution of NK cells, T 
cells, and the MHC have been described 
in marine invertebrates (29). They also 
use polymorphic transmembrane pro-
teins that contain Ig-like domains but have 
minimal homology to nonself recogni-
tion systems in vertebrates (30–32).
Inhibitory functions of SIRP on my-
eloid cells have been well characterized 
(16, 33). SIRP engagement by CD47 sup-
presses macrophage phagocytic function 
(18, 34) and DC maturation (20). CD47, 
in contrast, has stimulatory functions in 
immune cells. It provides costimulatory 
signals to T cells (21, 35) and enhances 
DC homeostasis and migration (36). Consistent with these func-
tions, CD47−/− mice were refractory to the induction of autoimmune 
diseases; for example, experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (37), 
experimental colitis (38), and murine lupus (39). In addition, Wong et al. 
showed that enhanced binding of SIRP to CD47 in the NOD mouse 
is a key determinant of the pathogenesis of autoimmune diabetes, 
likely due to the costimulatory actions of CD47 on T cells (12). Together, 
these data support our proposal that engagement of CD47 on recip-
ient monocytes by SIRP on graft cells provides an activation signal 
that causes monocyte proliferation and differentiation. However, a 
caveat to our study is that it lacks direct proof that SIRP polymor-
phism causes differential CD47 signaling in allostimulated monocytes. 
The intracellular signaling pathways triggered by CD47 in monocytes 
are not known and seem complex. On the basis of the studies in 
nonmyeloid cells, CD47 likely signals via Gi protein–dependent or 
Gi protein–independent pathways by associating with integrins in 
the cell membrane (40).
A role for CD47-SIRP interactions in transplantation has been 
previously reported but only in the context of the long-held view that 
CD47 is a marker of self that, if altered or absent, triggers immune 
activation (16). Because CD47 is species-specific (41), xenografts acti-
vate host phagocytes because xenogeneic CD47 on the graft does 
not bind to host SIRP (42). However, the phagocytic response is sig-
nificantly diminished if the graft is made to express host CD47 (43) 
or if the host carries a SIRP variant that binds xenogeneic CD47 
with high affinity. The latter is exemplified by the ease of acceptance 
of human stem cells by immunodeficient NOD mice because of the 
exceptional binding of NOD SIRP to human CD47 (14, 15). CD47 
expression on donor cells also plays a role in the alloimmune re-
sponse. Wang et al. showed that the infusion of allogeneic spleen 
cells in mice results in the acceptance of a subsequent graft from the

same donor but fails to do so if the spleen cells lacked CD47 due to 
activation of host DCs (44, 45). In contrast, our work has identified 
an alternate function of the CD47-SIRP pathway whereby the poly-
morphic partner, SIRP, serves as a marker of allogeneic nonself on 
donor tissues that is detected by CD47 on host monocytes.
Although we did not establish in this study a formal association 
between donor SIRP polymorphism or SIRP-CD47 interactions and 
allograft outcomes, several lines of evidence suggest that this path-
way is important in both bone marrow and solid organ transplanta-
tion. For example, CD47−/− recipients were found to accept xenogeneic 
and allogeneic hematopoietic stem cells more readily than wild-type 
mice and to develop less graft-versus-host disease (23, 46). Conversely, 
CD47−/− donor cells failed to engraft because of the increased phago-
cytosis by recipient macrophages (47). Similar to bone marrow grafts, 
heart allografts from NOD donors harbored significantly more ma-
ture mono-DCs than allografts from NOR mice (5). These DCs were 
particularly adept at driving type 1 T cell responses that drive allograft 
rejection (5, 7). Whether SIRP polymorphism, which is also preva-
lent in the human population (14), modulates outcomes after bone 
marrow or solid organ transplantation remains to be seen. Another 
intriguing possibility is that SIRP polymorphism may affect the ma-
ternal response to the allogeneic fetus or influence the pathogenesis 
of immune-mediated diseases of pregnancy. Therefore, exploring the 
role of SIRP in natural (pregnancy) or artificial (transplantation) al-
logeneic encounters should yield important biological and clinical 
insights.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study design
We used a bone marrow plug transplantation model to conduct a 
genetic mapping study. Six biological replicates (six individual trans-
plant recipients) per group were included in each experiment. Both 
sexes of mice were used. Experiments were repeated once in most 
instances, resulting in a total of 12 biological replicates. Sample sizes 
were not based on power analysis but on our previous experience 
that three to six biological replicates are sufficient to discern statis-
tically significant differences between groups using the same read-
out (number of infiltrating host mono-DC) (5). Sample size was not 
altered at any time during the course of the study. A biological rep-
licate was excluded only if the mouse died before the bone marrow 
plug could be harvested on day 7 after transplantation. This exclu-
sion criterion was established prospectively, it occurred very rarely, 
and we did not experience any technical problems in harvesting or 
analyzing the grafts that would have led to exclusion of a biological 
replicate. All data points were included, and no outliers were ex-
cluded. All end points were prospectively selected. It was not possible 
to blind the study because of the need to identify donors and recip-
ients, and because in many instances, the donor or recipient groups 
had different coat colors. The first investigator (H.D. or K.I.A.-D.) 
to analyze the flow cytometry data was not blinded, but randomly 
chosen subset of groups were reanalyzed blindly by either M.H.O. 
or F.G.L.

Surgical procedures
Bone marrow plug transplantation was performed under the kidney 
capsule after isolating intact bone marrow plugs from donor femurs 
(48). Recipient mice were anesthetized, and the kidney was exposed 
via a small flank incision. A small incision was made in the kidney cap-
sule, a pocket was created with blunt forceps, and a 4-mm bone marrow 
plug fragment was placed in the subcapsular pocket with vascular 
forceps.
Mouse treatment
To block NOD SIRP-CD47 interaction, mice received 250 g of re-
combinant hCD47-Fc chimera (hCD47-Fc) (R&D Systems) intraperito-
neally for four times every other day starting on the day of transplantation. 
Control mice received an equivalent dose of recombinant hIgG1 Fc (R&D 
Systems). Both reagents were provided in endotoxin-free phosphate- 
buffered saline.
Mono-DC analysis by flow cytometry
Bone marrow plug grafts were removed from the kidney capsule, ho-
mogenized using a gentleMACS tissue processor (Miltenyi), and di-
gested at 37°C for 45 min in RPMI plus 10% fetal calf serum containing 
collagenase IV (350 U/ml; Sigma-Aldrich) and deoxyribonuclease I 
(20 ng/ml; Sigma-Aldrich). Leukocytes were isolated by gradient cen-
trifugation using Lympholyte-M (Cedarlane Laboratories). Total re-
covered cells were counted using a hemocytometer before staining 
with antibodies. Fluorochrome- or biotin-tagged antibodies were pur-
chased from BD Pharmingen, eBioscience, BioLegend, or R&D Systems: 
CD90.2 (30-H12), CD45.1 (A20), CD45.2 (104), CD45R/B220 (RA3-
6B2), CD49b (DX5), NK1.1 (PK136), F4/80 (BM8), CD11b (M1/70), 
CD11c (N418), Ly6G (1A8), CD19 (1D3), MHC II (M5/114.15.2), CD80 
(16-10A1), H-2Kd (SF1-1.1.1), and H2-kk (AF3-12.1.3). Fixable Viabil-
ity Dye eFluor 506 was purchased from Affymetrix/eBioscience. EdU 
uptake was analyzed using the Click-iT assay according to the man-
ufacturer’s instructions (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Flow acquisition 
was performed on an LSRFortessa flow cytometer (BD Biosciences), 
and data were analyzed using FlowJo software (Tree Star Corp.). Recipient 
and donor cells were distinguished using congenic markers (CD45.1/2), 
green fluorescent protein expression, or H-2 expression (in the case 
of BALB/c grafts).
CD47-SIRP binding assay
Flow-based mCD47-Fc (R&D Systems) binding assay was performed 
as previously described with some modifications (12). Briefly, spleen 
cells from indicated mouse strains were blocked with anti-CD16/32 
(BD Biosciences), followed by preclustering of SIRP with unconjugated 
P84 antibody (eBioscience). Cells were then incubated with serial 
dilutions of mCD47-Fc for 30 min, followed by secondary staining with 
anti–hIgG1–phycoerythrin (PE) (R&D Systems). Control cells were pre-
pared in the same fashion except that hIgG1 Fc (R&D Systems) was used 
instead of mCD47-Fc. Flow cytometry was performed to measure mCD47-
Fc binding to monocyte subset (CD45+Lin−Ly6G−CD11b+CD11c−F480− 
cells). SIRP expression was performed by staining cells with PE- 
conjugated P84 antibody (BD Biosciences) under identical conditions 
as binding assay.
Mouse SIRP sequence alignment
Whole mouse genomes were acquired from the Sanger Mouse Genome 
Project (www.sanger.ac.uk/science/data/mouse-genomes-project). 
A BLAST search was performed against the B6 Sirpa gene sequence 
to extract strain-specific Sirpa gene sequences from genomes of other 
strains. Gene sequences were translated to amino acid sequences 
and aligned to the B6 SIRP sequence using CLC Genomics Work-
bench. Variability of amino acids along the SIRP sequence was 
calculated as the number of different residues/frequency of the most 
common residue − 1. This measure of variability was plotted against 
the length of the SIRP amino acid sequence to identify the most 
variable regions. A phylogram of SIRP IgV domain amino acid se-
quences was compiled in CLC Genomics Workbench to represent 
which strains were most similar or dissimilar from each other.
Statistical analysis
All data points are shown in the graphs as scatterplots. Bars depict the 
means. GraphPad Prism 6 was used for statistical analyses. Statistical sig-
nificance (P < 0.05) was calculated using the unpaired two-sided t test, and 
P values are shown in the graphs. All comparisons found to be significant 
by t test were also significant by the nonparametric Mann-Whitney test.
