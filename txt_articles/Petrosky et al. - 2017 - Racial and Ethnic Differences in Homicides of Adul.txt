Homicide is one of the leading causes of death for women 
aged ≤44 years.* In 2015, homicide caused the death of 3,519 
girls and women in the United States. Rates of female homi-
cide vary by race/ethnicity (1), and nearly half of victims are 
killed by a current or former male intimate partner (2). To 
inform homicide and intimate partner violence (IPV) preven-
tion efforts, CDC analyzed homicide data from the National 
Violent Death Reporting System (NVDRS) among 10,018 
women aged ≥18 years in 18 states during 2003–2014. The 
frequency of homicide by race/ethnicity and precipitating 
circumstances of homicides associated with and without IPV 
were examined. Non-Hispanic black and American Indian/
Alaska Native women experienced the highest rates of homicide 
(4.4 and 4.3 per 100,000 population, respectively). Over half 
of all homicides (55.3%) were IPV-related; 11.2% of victims 
of IPV-related homicide experienced some form of violence 
in the month preceding their deaths, and argument and jeal-
ousy were common precipitating circumstances. Targeted IPV 
prevention programs for populations at disproportionate risk 
and enhanced access to intervention services for persons expe-
riencing IPV are needed to reduce homicides among women.
CDC’s NVDRS is an active state-based surveillance system 
that monitors characteristics of violent deaths, including 
homicides. The system links three data sources (death cer-
tificates, coroner/medical examiner reports, and law enforce-
ment reports) to create a comprehensive depiction of who 
dies from violence, where and when victims die, and factors 
perceived to contribute to the victim’s death (3). This report 
includes NVDRS data from 18 states during 2003–2014 (all 
available years).† Five racial/ethnic categories§ were used for 
this analysis: white, black, American Indian/Alaska Native 
* CDC’s Web-based Injury Statistics Query and Reporting System (WISQARS). 
https://www.cdc.gov/injury/wisqars/index.html.
† In 2003, the National Violent Death Reporting System (NVDRS) began data 
collection with six states (Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Oregon, South 
Carolina, and Virginia) participating; seven states (Alaska, Colorado, Georgia, 
North Carolina, Oklahoma, Rhode Island, and Wisconsin) joined in 2004, 
four (California, Kentucky, New Mexico, and Utah) in 2005, and two (Ohio 
and Michigan) in 2010. California did not collect statewide data and concluded 
participation in 2009. Ohio collected statewide data starting in 2011 and 
Michigan starting in 2014. CDC provides funding for state participation, and 
the ultimate goal is for NVDRS to expand to include all 50 states, U.S. 
territories, and the District of Columbia.
§ Information on race and ethnicity are recorded as separate items in NVDRS 
consistent with U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and 
Office of Management and Budget standards for race/ethnicity categorization. 
HHS guidance on race/ethnicity is available at https://aspe.hhs.gov/datacncl/

(AI/AN), Asian/Pacific Islander (A/PI), and Hispanic. Persons 
categorized as Hispanic might have been of any race. Persons 
categorized as one of the four racial populations were all non-
Hispanic. Analyses were limited to female decedents aged ≥18 
years. IPV-related deaths were defined as those involving inti-
mate partner homicides (i.e., the victim was an intimate partner 
[e.g., current, former, or unspecified spouse or girlfriend] of the 
suspect), other deaths associated with IPV, including victims 
who were not the intimate partner (i.e., family, friends, oth-
ers who intervened in IPV, first responders, or bystanders), or 
jealousy. Deaths where jealousy, such as in a lovers’ triangle, 
was noted as a factor were included only when they involved 
an actual relationship (versus unrequited interest). Violence 
experienced in the preceding month refers to all types of 
violence (e.g., robbery, assault, or IPV) that was distinct and 
occurred before the violence that killed the victim; there did 
not need to be any causal link between the earlier violence and 
the death itself (e.g., victim could have experienced a robbery 
by a stranger 2 weeks before being killed by her spouse).
Rates were calculated using intercensal and postcensal 
bridged–race population estimates compiled by CDC’s 
National Center for Health Statistics and were age-adjusted to 
the 2010 standard U.S. population of women aged ≥18 years 
(4). Sociodemographic characteristics and precipitating cir-
cumstances across racial/ethnic groups were examined using 
chi-square and Fisher’s exact tests. Two-sided p-values <0.05 
were considered statistically significant. Differences in victim 
and incident characteristics by race/ethnicity were examined 
using chi-square and Fisher’s exact tests with posthoc pairwise 
comparisons of significant results; Bonferroni correction was 
applied to account for multiple comparisons.
From 2003 through 2014, a total of 10,018 female homicides 
were captured by NVDRS; among these, 1,835 (18.3%) were 
part of a homicide-suicide incident (i.e., suspect died by suicide 
after perpetrating homicide). Homicide victims ranged in age 
from 18 to 100 years. The overall age-adjusted homicide rate 
was 2.0 per 100,000 women. By race/ethnicity, non-Hispanic 
black women had the highest rate of dying by homicide 
(4.4 per 100,000), followed by AI/AN (4.3), Hispanic (1.8), 
non-Hispanic white (1.5), and A/PI women (1.2).
Approximately one third of female homicide victims (29.4%) 
were aged 18–29 years (Table 1); a larger proportion of non-
Hispanic black and Hispanic victims were in this youngest 
age group than were non-Hispanic white and A/PI victims 
(p<0.01). The largest proportion of victims were never mar-
ried or single at the time of death (38.2%); this proportion 
was highest among non-Hispanic black victims (59.2%; 
p<0.01). One third of victims had attended some college 
or more; history of college attendance was highest among 
non-Hispanic white (36.8%) and A/PI victims (46.2%; 
p<0.01). Approximately 15% of women of reproductive age 
(18–44 years) were pregnant or ≤6 weeks postpartum. Firearms 
were used in 53.9% of female homicides, most commonly 
among non-Hispanic black victims (57.7%; p<0.01). Sharp 
instrument (19.8%); hanging, suffocation, or strangulation 
(10.5%); and blunt instrument (7.9%) were other common

mechanisms. Over half of all female homicides (55.3%) for 
which circumstances were known were IPV-related. A larger 
percentage of IPV-related female homicides were perpetrated 
by male suspects than were non-IPV-related homicides (98.2% 
versus 88.5%, respectively; p<0.01).
Circumstance information was known for all 4,442 IPV-
related homicides and 3,586 (64.3%) non-IPV-related homi-
cides and was examined further. Among IPV-related homicides, 
79.2% and 14.3% were perpetrated by a current or former 
intimate partner, respectively (Table 2). Approximately one in 
10 victims experienced some form of violence in the month 
preceding their death. However, only 11.2% of all IPV-related 
homicides were precipitated by another crime; 54.4% of 
these incidents involved another crime in progress. The most 
frequently reported other precipitating crimes were assault/
homicide (45.6%), rape/sexual assault (11.1%), and burglary

(9.9%). In 29.7% of IPV-related homicides, an argument 
preceded the victim’s death; this occurred more commonly 
among Hispanic victims than among non-Hispanic black and 
white victims. Approximately 12% of IPV-related homicides 
were associated with jealousy; this circumstance was also 
documented more commonly among Hispanic victims than 
among non-Hispanic black and white victims.
Among non-IPV related female homicides with known 
suspects, the victim’s relationship to the suspect was most 
often that of acquaintance (19.7%), stranger (15.7%), another 
person known to the victim in which the exact nature of the 
relationship or prior interaction was unclear (15.2%), or parent 
(15.2%) (Table 3). Non-Hispanic black victims were signifi-
cantly more likely to be killed by an acquaintance (29.0%) than 
were non-Hispanic white victims (14.9%). A/PI and Hispanic 
victims were significantly more likely to be killed by a stranger 
(28.6% and 24.1%, respectively) than were non-Hispanic 
white victims (13.9%). Fewer than 2% of non-IPV related 
homicide victims experienced violence during the preceding 
month (data not shown). However, a substantial percentage of 
these homicides (41.6%) were precipitated by another crime; 
67.2% of these incidents involved another crime in progress. 
The type of other precipitating crime was most frequently rob-
bery (31.1%), assault/homicide (21.3%), burglary (12.2%), or 
rape/sexual assault (11.2%). Female homicides involving A/PI 
victims were more likely to be precipitated by another crime 
(57.0%) than were homicides involving non-Hispanic black 
(40.7%) and Hispanic (35.4%) victims. In 37.8% of non-IPV 
related homicides, an argument preceded the victim’s death, 
more commonly among AI/AN (47.8%) and non-Hispanic 
black (41.1%) victims than among A/PI (25.6%) victims.
Discussion
Homicide is the most severe health outcome of violence 
against women. Findings from this study of female homicides 
from NVDRS during 2003–2014 indicate that young women, 
particularly racial/ethnic minority women, were disproportion-
ately affected. Across all racial/ethnic groups of women, over 
half of female homicides for which circumstances were known 
were IPV-related, with >90% of these women being killed by 
their current or former intimate partner.
Strategies to prevent IPV-related homicides range from 
protecting women from immediate harm and intervening in 
current IPV, to developing and implementing programs and 
policies to prevent IPV from occurring (5). IPV lethality risk 
assessments conducted by first responders have shown high 
sensitivity in identifying victims at risk for future violence and 
homicide (6). These assessments might be used to facilitate 
immediate safety planning and to connect women with other 
services, such as crisis intervention and counseling, housing, 
medical and legal advocacy, and access to other community 
resources (6). State statutes limiting access to firearms for 
persons under a domestic violence restraining order can serve 
as another preventive measure associated with reduced risk 
for intimate partner homicide and firearm intimate partner 
homicide (7). Approximately one in 10 victims of IPV-related 
homicide experienced some form of violence in the preced-
ing month, which could have provided opportunities for 
intervention. Bystander programs, such as Green Dot,¶ teach 
participants how to recognize situations or behaviors that might 
become violent and safely and effectively intervene to reduce 
the likelihood of assault (8). In health care settings, the U.S. 
Preventive Services Task Force recommends screening women 
of childbearing age for IPV and referring women who screen 
positive for intervention services.** Approximately 15% of 
female homicide victims of reproductive age (18–44 years) 
were pregnant or postpartum, which might or might not be 
higher than estimates in the general U.S. female population, 
requiring further examination.
Approximately 40% of non-Hispanic black, AI/AN, and 
Hispanic female homicide victims were aged 18–29 years. 
Argument and jealousy were common precipitating factors for 
IPV-related homicides. Teaching safe and healthy relationship 
skills is an important primary prevention strategy with evidence 
of effectiveness in reducing IPV by helping young persons 
manage emotions and relationship conflicts and improve their 
problem-solving and communication skills (5). Preventing 
IPV also requires addressing the community- and system-level 
factors that increase the risk for IPV; neighborhoods with high 
disorder, disadvantage, and poverty, and low social cohesion 
are associated with increased risk of IPV (5), and underlying 
health inequities caused by barriers in language, geography, and 
cultural familiarity might contribute to homicides, particularly 
among racial/ethnic minority women (9).
The findings in this report are subject to at least five limita-
tions. First, NVDRS data are available from a limited number 
of states and are therefore not nationally representative. Second, 
race/ethnicity data on death certificates might be misclassified, 
particularly for Hispanics, A/PI, and AI/AN (10). Third, the 
female homicide victims in this dataset were more likely to 
be never married or single and less likely to have attended 
college than the general U.S. female population††; although 
this is likely attributable to the relatively younger age distri-
bution of homicide victims in general,§§ this requires further

Summary
What is already known about this topic?
Homicide is one of the leading causes of death for women aged 
≤44 years, and rates vary by race/ethnicity. Nearly half of female 
victims are killed by a current or former male intimate partner.
What is added by this report?
Homicides occur in women of all ages and among all races/
ethnicities, but young, racial/ethnic minority women are 
disproportionately affected. Over half of female homicides for 
which circumstances were known were related to intimate 
partner violence (IPV). Arguments and jealousy were common 
precipitating circumstances among IPV-related homicides. One 
in 10 victims of IPV-related homicide were reported to have 
experienced violence in the month preceding their deaths.
What are the implications for public health practice?
Racial/ethnic differences in female homicide underscore the 
importance of targeting intervention efforts to populations at 
risk and the conditions that increase the risk for violence. IPV 
lethality risk assessments might be useful tools for first respond-
ers to identify women at risk for future violence and connect 
them with life-saving safety planning and services. Teaching 
young persons safe and healthy relationship skills as well as 
how to recognize situations or behaviors that might become 
violent are effective IPV primary prevention measures.
examination. Fourth, not all homicide cases include detailed 
suspect information; in this analysis, 85.3% of cases included 
information on the suspect. Finally, information about male 
corollary victims of IPV-related homicide (i.e., other deaths 
associated with IPV, including male victims who were not the 
intimate partner) were not included in this analysis. Therefore, 
the full scope of IPV-related homicides involving women is 
not captured.
The racial/ethnic differences in female homicide underscore 
the importance of targeting prevention and intervention efforts 
to populations at disproportionately high risk. Addressing 
violence will require an integrated response that considers the 
influence of larger community and societal factors that make 
violence more likely to occur.
