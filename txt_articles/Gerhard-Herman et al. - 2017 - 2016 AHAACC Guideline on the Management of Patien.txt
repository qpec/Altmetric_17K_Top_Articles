PREAMBLE
Since 1980, the American College of Cardiology (ACC) 
and American Heart Association (AHA) have translated 
scientific evidence into clinical practice guidelines with 
recommendations to improve cardiovascular health� 
These guidelines, based on systematic methods to 
evaluate and classify evidence, provide a cornerstone of 
quality cardiovascular care�
In response to reports from the Institute of Medicine1,2 
and a mandate to evaluate new knowledge and maintain 
relevance at the point of care, the ACC/AHA Task Force 
on Clinical Practice Guidelines (Task Force) modified its 
methodology�3–5 The relationships among guidelines, 
data standards, appropriate use criteria, and perfor-
mance measures are addressed elsewhere�5
Intended Use
Practice guidelines provide recommendations applicable 
to patients with or at risk of developing cardiovascular 
disease� The focus is on medical practice in the United 
States, but guidelines developed in collaboration with 
other organizations may have a broader target� Although 
guidelines may be used to inform regulatory or payer 
decisions, the intent is to improve quality of care and 
align with patients’ interests� Guidelines are intended to 
define practices meeting the needs of patients in most, 
but not all, circumstances, and should not replace clini-
cal judgment� Guidelines are reviewed annually by the 
Task Force and are official policy of the ACC and AHA� 
Each guideline is considered current until it is updated, 
revised, or superseded by published addenda, state-
ments of clarification, focused updates, or revised full-
text guidelines� To ensure that guidelines remain current, 
new data are reviewed biannually to determine whether 
recommendations should be modified� In general, full re-
visions are posted in 5-year cycles�3–6
Modernization
Processes have evolved to support the evolution of 
guidelines as “living documents” that can be dynamically 
updated� This process delineates a recommendation to 
address a specific clinical question, followed by concise 
text (ideally <250 words) and hyperlinked to support-

ive evidence� This approach accommodates time con-
straints on busy clinicians and facilitates easier access 
to recommendations via electronic search engines and 
other evolving technology�
Evidence Review
Writing committee members review the literature; weigh 
the quality of evidence for or against particular tests, 
treatments, or procedures; and estimate expected 
health outcomes� In developing recommendations, the 
writing committee uses evidence-based methodolo-
gies that are based on all available data�3–7 Literature 
searches focus on randomized controlled trials (RCTs) 
but also include registries, nonrandomized comparative 
and descriptive studies, case series, cohort studies, 
systematic reviews, and expert opinion� Only selected 
references are cited�
The Task Force recognizes the need for objective, 
independent Evidence Review Committees (ERCs) that 
include methodologists, epidemiologists, clinicians, and 
biostatisticians who systematically survey, abstract, 
and assess the evidence to address systematic review 
questions posed in the PICOTS format (P=population, 
I=intervention, C=comparator, O=outcome, T=timing, 
S=setting)�2,4–6 Practical considerations, including time 
and resource constraints, limit the ERCs to evidence 
that is relevant to key clinical questions and lends itself 
to systematic review and analysis that could affect the 
strength of corresponding recommendations�
Guideline-Directed Management and Treatment
The term “guideline-directed management and therapy” 
(GDMT) refers to care defined mainly by ACC/AHA Class I 
recommendations� For these and all recommended drug 
treatment regimens, the reader should confirm dosage 
with product insert material and carefully evaluate for 
contraindications and interactions� Recommendations 
are limited to treatments, drugs, and devices approved 
for clinical use in the United States�
Class of Recommendation and Level of Evidence
The Class of Recommendation (COR; ie, the strength of 
the recommendation) encompasses the anticipated mag-
nitude and certainty of benefit in proportion to risk� The 
Level of Evidence (LOE) rates evidence supporting the 
effect of the intervention on the basis of the type, quality, 
quantity, and consistency of data from clinical trials and 
other reports (Table 1)�3–5 Unless otherwise stated, rec-
ommendations are sequenced by COR and then by LOE� 
Where comparative data exist, preferred strategies take 
precedence� When >1 drug, strategy, or therapy exists 
within the same COR and LOE and no comparative data 
are available, options are listed alphabetically�
Relationships With Industry and Other Entities
The ACC and AHA sponsor the guidelines without com-
mercial support, and members volunteer their time� 
The Task Force zealously avoids actual, potential, or 
perceived conflicts of interest that might arise through 
relationships with industry or other entities (RWI)� All 
writing committee members and reviewers are required 
to disclose current industry relationships or personal 
interests, from 12 months before initiation of the writ-
ing effort� Management of RWI involves selecting a bal-
anced writing committee and assuring that the chair and 
a majority of committee members have no relevant RWI 
(Appendix 1)� Members are restricted with regard to writ-
ing or voting on sections to which their RWI apply� For 
transparency, members’ comprehensive disclosure in-
formation is available online� Comprehensive disclosure 
information for the Task Force is also available online�
The Task Force strives to avoid bias by selecting ex-
perts from a broad array of backgrounds representing 
different geographic regions, sexes, ethnicities, intel-
lectual perspectives/biases, and scopes of clinical prac-
tice, and by inviting organizations and professional soci-
eties with related interests and expertise to participate 
as partners or collaborators�
Individualizing Care in Patients With Associated 
Conditions and Comorbidities
Managing patients with multiple conditions can be com-
plex, especially when recommendations applicable to co-
existing illnesses are discordant or interacting�8 The guide-
lines are intended to define practices meeting the needs 
of patients in most, but not all, circumstances� The rec-
ommendations should not replace clinical judgment�
Clinical Implementation
Management in accordance with guideline recommenda-
tions is effective only when followed� Adherence to recom-
mendations can be enhanced by shared decision making 
between clinicians and patients, with patient engagement 
in selecting interventions on the basis of individual values, 
preferences, and associated conditions and comorbidi-
ties� Consequently, circumstances may arise in which de-
viations from these guidelines are appropriate�

peripheral vascular disease/lower extremity arterial dis-
ease, smoking/smoking cessation, statin, stenting, and 
vascular surgery� Additional relevant studies published 
through September 2016, during the guideline writing 
process, were also considered by the writing commit-
tee, and added to the evidence tables when appropri-
ate� The final evidence tables included in the Online Data 
Supplement summarize the evidence utilized by the writ-
ing committee to formulate recommendations� Addition-
ally, the writing committee reviewed documents related 
to lower extremity peripheral artery disease (PAD) previ-
ously published by the ACC and AHA�9,10 References se-
lected and published in this document are representative 
and not all-inclusive�
As stated in the Preamble, the ACC/AHA guideline 
methodology provides for commissioning an indepen-
dent ERC to address systematic review questions (PI-
COTS format) to inform recommendations developed by 
the writing committee� All other guideline recommenda-
tions (not based on the systematic review questions) 
were also subjected to an extensive evidence review 
process� For this guideline, the writing committee in 
conjunction with the Task Force and ERC Chair identified 
the following systematic review questions: 1) Is antiplate-
let therapy beneficial for prevention of cardiovascular 
events in the patient with symptomatic or asymptomatic 
lower extremity PAD? 2) What is the effect of revascu-
larization, compared with optimal medical therapy and 
exercise training, on functional outcome and quality of 
life (QoL) among patients with claudication? Each ques-
tion has been the subject of recently published, system-
atic evidence reviews�11–13 The quality of these evidence 
reviews was appraised by the ACC/AHA methodologist 
and a vendor contracted to support this process (Doctor 
Evidence [Santa Monica, CA])� Few substantive random-
ized or nonrandomized studies had been published after 
the end date of the literature searches used for the ex-
isting evidence reviews, so the ERC concluded that no 
additional systematic review was necessary to address 
either of these critical questions�
A third systematic review question was then identi-
fied: 3) Is one revascularization strategy (endovascular 
or surgical) associated with improved cardiovascular 
and limb-related outcomes in patients with critical limb 
ischemia (CLI)? This question had also been the subject 
of a high-quality systematic review that synthesized evi-
dence from observational data and an RCT14; additional 
RCTs addressing this question are ongoing�15–17 The writ-
ing committee and the Task Force decided to expand 
the survey to include more relevant randomized and 
observational studies� Based on evaluation of this addi-
tional evidence the ERC decided that further systematic 
review was not needed to inform the writing committee 
on this question� Hence, the ERC and writing commit-
tee concluded that available systematic reviews could 
be used to inform the development of recommendations 
addressing each of the 3 systematic review questions 
specified above� The members of the Task Force and 
writing committee thank the members of the ERC that 
began this process and their willingness to participate 
in this volunteer effort� They include Aruna Pradhan, MD, 
MPH (ERC Chair); Natalie Evans, MD; Peter Henke, MD; 
Dharam J� Kumbhani, MD, SM, FACC; and Tamar Polon-
sky, MD�
1.2. Organization of the Writing Committee
The writing committee consisted of clinicians, includ-
ing noninvasive and interventional cardiologists, exer-
cise physiologists, internists, interventional radiolo-
gists, vascular nurses, vascular medicine specialists, 
and vascular surgeons, as well as clinical researchers 
in the field of vascular disease, a nurse (in the role of 
patient representative), and members with experience 
in epidemiology and/or health services research� The 
writing committee included representatives from the 
ACC and AHA, American Association of Cardiovascu-
lar and Pulmonary Rehabilitation, Inter-Society Con-
sensus for the Management of Peripheral Arterial 
Disease, Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and 
Interventions, Society for Clinical Vascular Surgery,

AND GUIDELINES
1.4. Scope of Guideline
Lower extremity PAD is a common cardiovascular dis-
ease that is estimated to affect approximately 8�5 million 
Americans above the age of 40 years and is associated 
with significant morbidity, mortality, and QoL impair-
ment�18 It has been estimated that 202 million people 
worldwide have PAD�19 The purpose of this document is 
to provide a contemporary guideline for diagnosis and 
management of patients with lower extremity PAD� This 
document supersedes recommendations related to 
lower extremity PAD in the “ACC/AHA 2005 Guidelines 
for the Management of Patients With Peripheral Arterial 
Disease”9 and the “2011 ACCF/AHA Focused Update of 
the Guideline for the Management of Patients With Pe-
ripheral Artery Disease�”10 The scope of this guideline is 
limited to atherosclerotic disease of the lower extrem-
ity arteries (PAD) and includes disease of the aortoiliac, 
femoropopliteal, and infrapopliteal arterial segments� It 
does not address nonatherosclerotic causes of lower ex-
tremity arterial disease, such as vasculitis, fibromuscular 
dysplasia, physiological entrapment syndromes, cystic 
adventitial disease, and other entities� Future guidelines 
will address aneurysmal disease of the abdominal aorta 
and lower extremity arteries and diseases of the renal 
and mesenteric arteries�
In developing the “2016 AHA/ACC Guideline on the 
Management of Patients With Lower Extremity Periph-
eral Artery Disease,” the writing committee reviewed the 
evidence to support recommendations in the relevant 
ACC/AHA guidelines noted in Table 2 and affirms the 
ongoing validity of the related recommendations, thus 
obviating the need to repeat existing guideline recom-
mendations in the current guideline� Table 2 also con-
tains a list of other statements that may be of interest 
to the reader� Table 3 includes definitions for PAD key 
terms used throughout the guideline�

Acute limb 
ischemia (ALI)
Acute (<2 wk), severe hypoperfusion of the limb characterized by these features: pain, pallor, pulselessness, poikilothermia 
(cold), paresthesias, and paralysis.
 One of these categories of ALI is assigned (Section 10):
  I.  
Viable—Limb is not immediately threatened; no sensory loss; no muscle weakness; audible arterial and venous 
Doppler.
  II.  
Threatened—Mild-to-moderate sensory or motor loss; inaudible arterial Doppler; audible venous Doppler; may be 
further divided into IIa (marginally threatened) or IIb (immediately threatened).
  III.  
Irreversible—Major tissue loss or permanent nerve damage inevitable; profound sensory loss, anesthetic; profound 
muscle weakness or paralysis (rigor); inaudible arterial and venous Doppler.33,34
Tissue loss
Type of tissue loss:
 Minor—nonhealing ulcer, focal gangrene with diffuse pedal ischemia.
 Major—extending above transmetatarsal level; functional foot no longer salvageable.33
Critical limb 
ischemia (CLI)
A condition characterized by chronic (≥2 wk) ischemic rest pain, nonhealing wound/ulcers, or gangrene in 1 or both legs 
attributable to objectively proven arterial occlusive disease.
  
The diagnosis of CLI is a constellation of both symptoms and signs. Arterial disease can be proved objectively with 
ABI, TBI, TcPO2, or skin perfusion pressure. Supplementary parameters, such as absolute ankle and toe pressures and 
pulse volume recordings, may also be used to assess for significant arterial occlusive disease. However, a very low  
ABI or TBI does not necessarily mean the patient has CLI. The term CLI implies chronicity and is to be distinguished 
from ALI.35
In-line blood flow
Direct arterial flow to the foot, excluding collaterals.
Functional status
Patient’s ability to perform normal daily activities required to meet basic needs, fulfill usual roles, and maintain health and well-
being. Walking ability is a component of functional status.
Nonviable limb
Condition of extremity (or portion of extremity) in which loss of motor function, neurological function, and tissue integrity cannot 
be restored with treatment.
Salvageable limb
Condition of extremity with potential to secure viability and preserve motor function to the weight-bearing portion of the foot if 
treated.
Structured 
exercise program
Planned program that provides individualized recommendations for type, frequency, intensity, and duration of exercise.
  
Program provides recommendations for exercise progression to assure that the body is consistently challenged to increase 
exercise intensity and levels as functional status improves over time.
  
There are 2 types of structured exercise program for patients with PAD:
  1. Supervised exercise program
  2. Structured community- or home-based exercise program
Supervised 
exercise program
Structured exercise program that takes place in a hospital or outpatient facility in which intermittent walking exercise is used as 
the treatment modality.
  
Program can be standalone or can be made available within a cardiac rehabilitation program.
  
Program is directly supervised by qualified healthcare provider(s).
  
Training is performed for a minimum of 30 to 45 min per session, in sessions performed at least 3 times/wk for a 
minimum of 12 wk.36–46 Patients may not initially achieve these targets, and a treatment goal is to progress to these 
levels over time.
  
Training involves intermittent bouts of walking to moderate-to-maximum claudication, alternating with periods of rest.
  
Warm-up and cool-down periods precede and follow each session of walking.
Structured 
community- or 
home-based 
exercise program
Structured exercise program that takes place in the personal setting of the patient rather than in a clinical setting.41,47–51
  
Program is self-directed with the guidance of healthcare providers who prescribe an exercise regimen similar to that of a 
supervised program.
  
Patient counseling ensures that patients understand how to begin the program, how to maintain the program, and how to 
progress the difficulty of the walking (by increasing distance or speed).
  
Program may incorporate behavioral change techniques, such as health coaching and/or use of activity monitors.

AND GUIDELINES
2. CLINICAL ASSESSMENT FOR PAD
Evaluating the patient for PAD begins with the clinical history, review of symptoms, and physical examination�
2.1. History and Physical Examination: Recommendations
Emergency versus 
urgent
  
An emergency procedure is one in which life or limb is threatened if the patient is not in the operating room or interventional 
suite and/or where there is time for no or very limited clinical evaluation, typically within <6 h.
  
An urgent procedure is one in which there may be time for a limited clinical evaluation, usually when life or limb is 
threatened if the patient is not in the operating room or interventional suite, typically between 6 and 24 h.
Interdisciplinary 
care team
A team of professionals representing different disciplines to assist in the evaluation and management of the patient  
with PAD.
  
For the care of patients with CLI, the interdisciplinary care team should include individuals who are skilled in 
endovascular revascularization, surgical revascularization, wound healing therapies and foot surgery, and medical 
evaluation and care.
  
Interdisciplinary care team members may include:
   
Vascular medical and surgical specialists (ie, vascular medicine, vascular surgery, interventional radiology, interventional 
cardiology)
   
Nurses
   
Orthopedic surgeons and podiatrists
   
Endocrinologists
   
Internal medicine specialists
   
Infectious disease specialists
   
Radiology and vascular imaging specialists
   
Physical medicine and rehabilitation clinicians
   
Orthotics and prosthetics specialists

Exercise physiologists
   
Physical and occupational therapists
   
Nutritionists/dieticians
Cardiovascular 
ischemic events
Acute coronary syndrome (acute MI, unstable angina), stroke, or cardiovascular death.
Limb-related events
Worsening claudication, new CLI, new lower extremity revascularization, or new ischemic amputation.
ABI indicates ankle-brachial index; ALI, acute limb ischemia; CLI, critical limb ischemia; MI, myocardial infarction; PAD, peripheral artery disease; TBI,

Patients at increased risk of PAD (Table 4) should undergo a comprehensive medical history and a review 
of symptoms to assess for exertional leg symptoms, including claudication or other walking impairment, 
ischemic rest pain, and nonhealing wounds.52–57
See Online Data 
Supplement 1.
The symptoms and signs of PAD are variable. Patients with PAD may experience the classic symptom of claudication 
or may present with advanced disease, including CLI. Studies have demonstrated that the majority of patients 
with confirmed PAD do not have typical claudication but have other non–joint-related limb symptoms or are 
asymptomatic.53,55 Atypical lower extremity symptoms related to PAD may include pain or discomfort that begins at rest 
but worsens with exertion, pain or discomfort that does not stop an individual from walking, and pain or discomfort 
that begins with exertion but is not alleviated within 10 minutes of rest.54 Patients with PAD who do not have typical 
claudication but have other leg symptoms, or who are asymptomatic, have been shown to have functional impairment 
comparable to patients with claudication.54 Thus, all patients at increased risk of PAD should be asked not only about 
claudication but also about other exertional non–joint-related limb symptoms and perceived walking impairment.

Patients at increased risk of PAD (Table 4) should undergo vascular examination, including palpation of lower 
extremity pulses (ie, femoral, popliteal, dorsalis pedis, and posterior tibial), auscultation for femoral bruits, and 
inspection of the legs and feet.56,58,59
See Online Data 
Supplements.
A thorough lower extremity vascular examination and careful inspection of the legs and feet are important components 
of the clinical assessment for PAD. To perform a thorough examination, legs and feet are examined with lower garments 
(pants/skirt, shoes, and socks) removed. Examination findings suggestive of PAD are shown in Table 5. Lower extremity 
pulses should be assessed and rated as follows: 0, absent; 1, diminished; 2, normal; or 3, bounding. Reproducibility of pulse 
assessment is better for detection of normal versus absent pulse than for normal versus diminished pulse.56 Absence of the 
dorsalis pedis pulse is less accurate for diagnosis of PAD than is absence of the posterior tibial pulse because the dorsalis 
pedis pulse can be absent on examination in a significant percentage of healthy patients.56,58 The presence of multiple 
abnormal physical findings (ie, multiple pulse abnormalities, bruits) increases the likelihood of confirmed PAD.56,58,59 Abnormal 
physical findings, such as a pulse abnormality, require confirmation with the ankle-brachial index (ABI) to establish the 
diagnosis of PAD. Similarly, an entirely normal pulse examination and absence of bruits decreases the likelihood of confirmed 
PAD.56,58 The presence of nonhealing lower extremity wounds may be a sign of CLI. Findings of cool or discolored skin and 
delayed capillary refill are not reliable for PAD diagnosis.56 To confirm the diagnosis of PAD, abnormal physical examination 
findings must be confirmed with diagnostic testing (Section 3), generally with the ABI as the initial test.

B-NR
Patients with PAD should undergo noninvasive blood pressure measurement in both arms at least once 
during the initial assessment.60–62
See Online Data 
Supplement 1.
An inter-arm blood pressure difference of >15 to 20 mm Hg is abnormal and suggestive of subclavian (or innominate) 
artery stenosis. Patients with PAD are at increased risk of subclavian artery stenosis.60–62 Measuring blood pressure in 
both arms identifies the arm with the highest systolic pressure, a requirement for accurate measurement of the ABI.27 
Identification of unequal blood pressures in the arms also allows for more accurate measurement of blood pressure in the 
treatment of hypertension (ie, blood pressure is taken at the arm with higher measurements). Although a difference in arm 
systolic pressures of >15 to 20 mm Hg suggests subclavian (or innominate) artery stenosis, in the absence of symptoms 
(eg, arm claudication or symptoms of vertebral artery steal), no further imaging or intervention is warranted.

Recommendations for Physiological Testing
COR
LOE
Recommendations
I
B-NR
Toe-brachial index (TBI) should be measured to diagnose patients with suspected PAD when the ABI is 
greater than 1.40.72,99–102
See Online Data 
Supplement 5.
TBI is a noninvasive test that is useful to evaluate for PAD in patents with noncompressible arteries, which cause an 
artificial elevation of the ABI.99,100,102,103 A TBI ≤0.70 is abnormal and diagnostic of PAD because the digital arteries are 
rarely noncompressible.99–102,104,105 Patients with longstanding diabetes mellitus72,101 or advanced chronic kidney disease106 
have a high incidence of noncompressible arteries. Therefore, TBI assessment allows for the diagnosis of PAD in these 
patients with noncompressible arteries who have history or physical examination findings suggestive of PAD (Figure 1).
Recommendations for Resting ABI for Diagnosing PAD
COR
LOE
Recommendations
I
B-NR
In patients with history or physical examination findings suggestive of PAD (Table 5), the resting ABI, with or 
without segmental pressures and waveforms, is recommended to establish the diagnosis.64–69
See Online Data 
Supplement 4.
The resting ABI is obtained by measuring systolic blood pressures at the arms (brachial arteries) and ankles (dorsalis pedis 
and posterior tibial arteries) in the supine position by using a Doppler device. The ABI of each leg is calculated by dividing 
the higher of the dorsalis pedis or posterior tibial pressure by the higher of the right or left arm blood pressure.27 In patients 
with a history or physical examination suggestive of PAD, the ABI has good validity as a first-line test in the diagnosis of 
PAD, as shown by vascular imaging, with sensitivities ranging from 68% to 84% and specificities from 84% to 99%.64–69 
Segmental lower extremity blood pressures and Doppler or plethysmographic waveforms (pulse volume recordings) can be 
used to localize anatomic segments of disease (eg, aortoiliac, femoropopliteal, infrapopliteal).34,70,71
I
C-LD
Resting ABI results should be reported as abnormal (ABI ≤0.90), borderline (ABI 0.91–0.99), normal (1.00–
1.40), or noncompressible (ABI >1.40).27,67–69,72
See Online Data 
Supplement 4.
Standardized reporting improves communication among healthcare providers. Calculated ABI values should be recorded 
to 2 decimal places. Patients with ABI ≤0.90 are diagnosed with PAD.67–69 Those with ABI 0.91 to 0.99 may possibly have 
PAD and should undergo exercise ABI, if the clinical suspicion of PAD is significant (Tables 4 and 5).73,74 Values >1.40 
indicate that the arteries were not able to be compressed, which is more common among individuals with diabetes mellitus 
and/or advanced chronic kidney disease. In the setting of noncompressible ABI values, additional imaging can be used to 
diagnose PAD if the clinical suspicion is significant (Figures 1 and 2).72 These cutpoints for ABI interpretation have been 
previously proposed and represent a reasonable standardized categorization.27
IIa
B-NR
In patients at increased risk of PAD (Table 4) but without history or physical examination findings suggestive 
of PAD (Table 5), measurement of the resting ABI is reasonable.54,55,75–97
See Online Data 
Supplements 3 and 4.
The ABI test is noninvasive, is simple to perform, and has minimal risks, making it suitable for use in asymptomatic 
individuals. Previous studies have demonstrated a significant prevalence of abnormal resting ABI among asymptomatic 
patients with risk factors for PAD.55,79,95 A significant body of evidence demonstrates that patients with an abnormal ABI who 
are asymptomatic have poorer cardiovascular morbidity and mortality outcomes than do patients with normal ABI.79–87 While 
there is no conclusive evidence that aspirin treatment changes cardiovascular or limb outcomes in this population, in 1 
cohort study of 5480 patients with asymptomatic PAD, statin treatment improved cardiovascular outcomes.75–78,96
There is also evidence that asymptomatic patients with a low resting ABI have a poorer functional status and a more rapid 
rate of functional decline than do patients with a normal ABI.54,88–92 Although physical activity has been shown to be associated with 
improvement in functional status in patients with asymptomatic PAD,93,94 the benefit of resting ABI testing to identify asymptomatic 
patients who are at increased risk of functional decline and may benefit from structured exercise programs remains to be determined.
III: No 
Benefit
B-NR
In patients not at increased risk of PAD (Table 4) and without history or physical examination findings 
suggestive of PAD (Table 5), the ABI is not recommended.95,98
See Online Data 
Supplement 4.
The prevalence of PAD among individuals without risk factors for atherosclerosis and who are <50 years of age is low. Data 
from population-based cohort studies have demonstrated a low prevalence (approximately 1%) of abnormal resting ABI among 
individuals <50 years of age.95,98 In the NHANES (National Health and Nutrition Study), approximately 95% of participants with 
an abnormal resting ABI had at least 1 risk factor for atherosclerosis.95 The yield of ABI testing among younger, asymptomatic 
individuals without risk factors for atherosclerosis is low, and these patients should not be routinely tested for PAD.95,98

Patients with exertional non–joint-related leg symptoms and normal or borderline resting ABI (>0.90 and 
≤1.40) should undergo exercise treadmill ABI testing to evaluate for PAD.71,74,107–110
See Online Data 
Supplement 5.
Exercise treadmill ABI testing is important to objectively measure symptom limitations and diagnose PAD.71,74,107–110 It 
is useful in establishing the diagnosis of lower extremity PAD in the symptomatic patient when resting ABIs are normal 
or borderline and to differentiate claudication from pseudoclaudication in individuals with exertional leg symptoms. If 
the post-exercise treadmill ABI is normal, alternative causes of leg pain are considered (Table 6). If a treadmill is not 
available, the pedal plantarflexion ABI test is a reasonable alternative because the results correlate well with treadmill 
ABIs (Figure 1).111

B-NR
In patients with PAD and an abnormal resting ABI (≤0.90), exercise treadmill ABI testing can be useful to 
objectively assess functional status.71,74,107–110
See Online Data 
Supplement 5.
In patients with PAD, exercise treadmill ABI testing can objectively assess symptoms, measure change in ABI in response 
to exercise, and assess functional status71,74,107–110 (Figure 1). It can be useful to correlate exertional lower extremity 
symptoms to a decline in ABI after treadmill exercise. Exercise treadmill ABI testing can document the magnitude of 
symptom limitation in patients with PAD and provide objective data that can demonstrate the safety of exercise and help to 
individualize exercise prescriptions in patients with PAD before initiation of a formal program of structured exercise training. 
Exercise ABI may also be used to objectively measure the functional improvement obtained in response to claudication 
treatment (eg, structured exercise program or revascularization). Administration of a 6-minute walk test in a corridor is a 
reasonable alternative to treadmill ABI testing for assessment of functional status.54
IIa
B-NR
In patients with normal (1.00–1.40) or borderline (0.91–0.99) ABI in the setting of nonhealing wounds or 
gangrene, it is reasonable to diagnose CLI by using TBI with waveforms, transcutaneous oxygen pressure 
(TcPO2), or skin perfusion pressure (SPP).112–116
See Online Data 
Supplement 5.
The toe pressure and TBI may be discordant with the ABI 0.90 to 1.40 in some patients with diabetes  
mellitus and a nonhealing wound (Figure 2).115,116 A TBI ≤0.70 is considered diagnostic of PAD.101,104,105  
Doppler or plethysmographic waveforms taken at the toe supplement the toe pressure and TBI measurement and 
may be severely dampened in the setting of CLI. The likelihood of wound healing decreases with toe pressure <30 
mm Hg.100 Perfusion assessment measures (ie, TBI with waveforms, TcPO2, SPP) are obtained in a warm room to 
prevent arterial vasoconstriction in response to the cold. TcPO2 measurements are performed with a standardized 
protocol and are taken at multiple sites.117 Correlation between TBI, TcPO2, and SPP has been reported.113 TcPO2 
>30 mm Hg has been used to predict ulcer healing.118 SPP ≥30 to 50 mm Hg is associated with increased 
likelihood of wound healing.113 If perfusion measures are normal or only mildly impaired, alternative causes of the 
nonhealing wounds are considered (Table 7). TcPO2 and SPP can be used in angiosome-targeted assessment for 
revascularization.119
IIa
B-NR
In patients with PAD with an abnormal ABI (≤0.90) or with noncompressible arteries (ABI >1.40 and TBI 
≤0.70) in the setting of nonhealing wounds or gangrene, TBI with waveforms, TcPO2, or SPP can be useful to 
evaluate local perfusion.112–116
See Online Data 
Supplement 5.
Perfusion assessment measures (eg, TBI with waveforms, TcPO2, SPP) can be useful when the ABI is only mildly 
reduced (eg, ABI 0.70–0.90) to determine whether factors other than PAD may be contributing to impaired 
wound healing (Figure 2). These perfusion assessment measures are obtained in a warm room to prevent arterial 
vasoconstriction in response to the cold. TcPO2 measurements are performed with a standardized protocol and are 
taken at multiple sites.117 The likelihood of wound healing decreases with toe pressure <30 mm Hg.100 There is 
correlation between TBI, TcPO2, and SPP. TcPO2 >30 mm Hg has been used to predict ulcer healing.118 SPP ≥30 to 50 
mm Hg is associated with increased likelihood of wound healing.113 TcPO2 and SPP can be used in angiosome-targeted 
assessment for revascularization.119 Additional perfusion assessment may also be useful for patients with nonhealing 
wounds or gangrene who have noncompressible arteries (ABI >1.40) but who have a diagnosis of PAD that is based on 
an abnormal TBI (ABI ≤0.70).

B-NR
Duplex ultrasound, computed tomography angiography (CTA), or magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) 
of the lower extremities is useful to diagnose anatomic location and severity of stenosis for patients with 
symptomatic PAD in whom revascularization is considered.118,120–122
See Online Data 
Supplement 6.
For symptomatic patients in whom ABI/TBI confirms PAD and in whom revascularization is considered, additional imaging with 
duplex ultrasonography, CTA, or MRA is useful to develop an individualized treatment plan, including assistance in selection of 
vascular access sites, identification of significant lesions, and determination of the feasibility of and modality for invasive treatment. 
All 3 of these noninvasive imaging methods have good sensitivity and specificity as compared with invasive angiography.118,120–122 
Renal function does not affect the safety of duplex ultrasonography, although duplex offers lower spatial resolution than CTA and 
MRA in the setting of arterial calcification. The tomographic data from CTA and MRA afford 3-dimensional reconstruction of the 
vessels examined. The iodinated contrast used in CTA confers risk of contrast-induced nephropathy and (rarely) severe allergic 
reaction123,124; CTA uses ionizing radiation. MRA does not use ionizing radiation; however, gadolinium contrast used frequently 
in MRA studies confers risk of nephrogenic systemic sclerosis for patients with advanced renal dysfunction and is therefore 
contraindicated in this population.125 The choice of the examination should be determined in an individualized approach to the

4.2. Screening for Asymptomatic Atherosclerosis 
in Other Arterial Beds (Coronary, Carotid, and 
Renal Arteries)
The prevalence of atherosclerosis in the coronary, ca-
rotid, and renal arteries is higher in patients with PAD 
than in those without PAD�128,130–135 However, intensive 
atherosclerosis risk factor modification in patients with 
PAD is justified regardless of the presence of disease in 
other arterial beds� Thus, the only justification for screen-
ing for disease in other arterial beds is if revasculariza-
tion results in a reduced risk of myocardial infarction 
(MI), stroke, or death, and this has never been shown� 
 
Currently, there is no evidence to demonstrate that screen-
ing all patients with PAD for asymptomatic atherosclerosis 
in other arterial beds improves clinical outcome� Intensive 
treatment of risk factors through GDMT is the principle 
method for preventing adverse cardiovascular ischemic 
events from asymptomatic disease in other arterial beds�

I
C-EO
Invasive angiography is useful for patients with CLI in whom revascularization is considered.
N/A
By definition, CLI results from extensive PAD that limits tissue perfusion. Because timely diagnosis and treatment are 
essential to preserve tissue viability in CLI, it is often most effective and expeditious to pursue invasive angiography with 
endovascular revascularization directly, without delay and potential risk of additional noninvasive imaging.
IIa
C-EO
Invasive angiography is reasonable for patients with lifestyle-limiting claudication with an inadequate 
response to GDMT for whom revascularization is considered.
N/A
For patients with lifestyle-limiting claudication despite GDMT (including structured exercise therapy)  
for whom revascularization is being considered, proceeding directly to invasive angiography for anatomic  
assessment and to determine revascularization strategy is reasonable. In certain clinical settings, noninvasive 
imaging studies for anatomic assessment (ie, duplex ultrasound, CTA, or MRA) may not be available because of lack 
of local resources or expertise. In addition, there are clinical scenarios in which noninvasive studies for anatomic 
assessment may be perceived to confer greater risk to the patient than invasive angiography (eg, patient with 
advanced chronic kidney disease for whom contrast dose for invasive angiography would be lower than that  
required for CTA).

B-R
Invasive and noninvasive angiography (ie, CTA, MRA) should not be performed for the anatomic assessment 
of patients with asymptomatic PAD.123,124,126

Angiography, either noninvasive or invasive, should not be performed for the anatomic assessment of patients 
with PAD without leg symptoms because delineation of anatomy will not change treatment for this population. 
This lack of benefit occurs in the setting of risk of contrast-induced nephropathy, patient discomfort, and allergic 
reactions.123,124,126This recommendation does not address assessment of lower extremity aneurysmal disease or 
nonatherosclerotic causes of arterial disease, which is beyond the scope of this document.

Antiplatelet therapy with aspirin alone (range 75–325 mg per day) or clopidogrel alone  
(75 mg per day) is recommended to reduce MI, stroke, and vascular death in patients with symptomatic 
PAD.139–142
See Online Data 
Supplement 13.
The effect of antiplatelet therapy on cardiovascular events has been systematically reviewed by the Antithrombotic Trialists’ 
Collaboration.139 Of note, this meta-analysis included studies of antiplatelet agents other than aspirin or clopidogrel. Among 
patients with symptomatic PAD treated with antiplatelet therapy, there was a 22% odds reduction for cardiovascular 
events, including MI, stroke, or vascular death.139 Symptomatic patients with lower extremity PAD included both those with 
claudication and those with prior lower extremity revascularization. The Antithrombotic Trialists’ Collaboration meta-analysis 
also compared the efficacy of different doses of aspirin.139 The proportional reduction in vascular events was 32% with 75 
to 150 mg daily, 26% with 160 to 325 mg daily, and 19% with 500 to 1500 mg daily, whereas there was a significantly 
smaller (13%) reduction in cardiovascular events in patients being treated with <75 mg of aspirin per day.139 CLIPS (Critical 
Leg Ischaemia Prevention Study) demonstrated a benefit of aspirin (100 mg daily) compared with placebo in preventing 
vascular events, but the study was too small to derive meaningful conclusions.140 A meta-analysis of trials of aspirin (alone 
or in combination with dipyridamole) for prevention of cardiovascular events in patients with PAD found a non–statistically 
significant reduction in the primary endpoint of cardiovascular death, MI, and stroke and a statistically significant reduction 
in the secondary endpoint of nonfatal stroke with aspirin versus placebo.141 The CAPRIE (Clopidogrel Versus Aspirin in 
Patients at Risk of Ischemic Events) trial demonstrated a benefit of clopidogrel as compared with aspirin in cardiovascular 
risk reduction and bleeding events in a population of patients with symptomatic atherosclerotic vascular disease, including 
a subgroup of patients with symptomatic PAD.142
IIa
C-EO
In asymptomatic patients with PAD (ABI ≤0.90), antiplatelet therapy is reasonable to reduce the risk of MI, 
stroke, or vascular death.
See Online Data 
Supplement 13.
Patients with PAD (ie, ABI ≤0.90) who do not have claudication may have leg symptoms atypical for claudication or may 
be too functionally limited to allow for adequate leg symptom assessment. Patients with PAD without claudication are 
at increased cardiovascular risk.79 Subgroup analysis in a trial evaluating asymptomatic patients did not show an effect 
of aspirin in patients with an abnormally low ABI (<0.80 or ≤0.90).76 However, the trial was not powered to analyze 
subgroups, and the uncertainty of the result does not rule out the possibility that aspirin could provide benefit in such 
patients, especially in those at increased risk of cardiovascular events. Another trial that included asymptomatic patients 
was too small to derive meaningful conclusions.140

In asymptomatic patients with borderline ABI (0.91–0.99), the usefulness of antiplatelet therapy to reduce the 
risk of MI, stroke, or vascular death is uncertain.75,76
See Online Data 
Supplement 13.
In asymptomatic patients with an abnormal or borderline ABI, 2 RCTs found that aspirin had no effect in reducing 
cardiovascular events75,76 and might increase bleeding.76 However, the trials were not powered to examine patients with 
borderline ABI separately. Given that cardiovascular risk is lower in patients with borderline ABI than in those with abnormal 
ABI,80 it would be unlikely that aspirin would have a meaningful effect in this subgroup when there was no evidence of an 
effect in the total trial populations.

The effectiveness of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) (aspirin and clopidogrel) to reduce the risk of 
cardiovascular ischemic events in patients with symptomatic PAD is not well established.143,144
See Online Data 
Supplement 13.
Based on findings from a subset of patients with PAD in the CHARISMA (Clopidogrel for High Atherothrombotic Risk and 
Ischemic Stabilization, Management, and Avoidance) trial, DAPT with aspirin plus clopidogrel may be considered for 
patients with PAD at particularly high risk of cardiovascular ischemic events who are not at high risk of bleeding.143,144 
Currently, there are sparse data on newer P2Y12 antagonists for PAD. There is uncertainty about the net benefit of long-term 
DAPT for patients with PAD—specifically the balance of risks of cardiovascular ischemic events versus major bleeding. 
Additional clinical trials are needed in the population with PAD. Refer to the DAPT guideline focused update for DAPT

There are sparse data on DAPT after lower extremity revascularization. Still, DAPT is prescribed in up to 55% of 
patients after endovascular revascularization for CLI.146 One small RCT of aspirin or aspirin plus clopidogrel in patients 
undergoing endovascular revascularization demonstrated that patients with DAPT had fewer repeat revascularization 
procedures for clinical symptoms.145 A subsequent small RCT of aspirin plus placebo or aspirin plus clopidogrel in 
patients after endovascular revascularization also showed a decrease in the need for repeat revascularization at 6 
months in patients receiving clopidogrel.147 An RCT of aspirin plus placebo or aspirin plus clopidogrel in patients who 
underwent below-knee bypass graft showed a decrease in limb-related events only in the prespecified subgroup of

This novel antagonist of protease-activated receptor-1 added to existing antiplatelet therapy reduced the risk of cardiovascular 
ischemic events in patients with atherosclerosis who were receiving standard therapy in an RCT.150,151 However, it also increased 
the risk of moderate or severe bleeding. Although the cardiovascular benefit was not demonstrated in the subgroup with 
symptomatic PAD, there was a reduction in limb-related events with vorapaxar, specifically in acute limb ischemia (ALI) and 
peripheral revascularization.149,152 More than half of ALI events in the PAD subset were due to thrombosis of lower extremity 
bypass grafts.149 Unfortunately, the benefit in limb events in patients with PAD was accompanied by an increased risk of 
bleeding.149,152 Therefore, the overall clinical benefit of vorapaxar in patients with PAD is uncertain.

worsening claudication, new CLI, new lower extremity revascularization, new ischemic amputation) compared with 
no statin.153 Use of simvastatin in the HPS reduced relative risk of peripheral vascular events (including noncoronary 
revascularization, aneurysm repair, major amputation, or PAD death) compared with placebo.155 In Medicare patients 
undergoing lower extremity revascularization, 1-year limb salvage rates were improved among those receiving statin 
medication.154 In a multicenter RCT, use of atorvastatin 80 mg daily improved pain-free walking time and community-

Although more secondary interventions occurred in the exercise group, the total number of interventions was greater in the 
endovascular revascularization group. Collectively, these studies provide strong support for offering patients a supervised 
exercise program for reducing claudication symptoms and for improving functional status and QoL.
A 3-month RCT that compared percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA), supervised exercise, and combined treatment 
for claudication found that both supervised exercise and PTA improved clinical and QoL outcomes, whereas PTA plus 
supervised exercise produced greater benefits than either therapy alone.217 The ERASE (Endovascular Revascularization 
and Supervised Exercise) study randomized participants with claudication to endovascular revascularization plus supervised 
exercise or supervised exercise alone. After 1 year, patients in both groups had significant improvements in walking 
distances and health-related QoL, with greater improvements in the combined-therapy group.218 Collectively, these 
studies support the continued provision of supervised exercise to patients with claudication, whether as a monotherapy or 
combined with revascularization.

In patients with PAD, a structured community- or home-based exercise program with behavioral change 
techniques can be beneficial to improve walking ability and functional status.49,88,94,213
See Online Data 
Supplement 32.
Unstructured community-based or home-based walking programs that consist of providing general recommendations 
to patients with claudication to simply walk more are not efficacious.50 Studies supporting structured community- or 
home-based programs for patients with symptomatic PAD (claudication and/or leg symptoms atypical for claudication) 
are more recent than studies supporting supervised exercise programs, and have provided strong evidence in support of 
the community- or home-based approach.47,49,51,88,94,213 For example, the GOALS (Group Oriented Arterial Leg Study) trial94 
included patients with confirmed PAD with and without claudication (atypical lower extremity symptoms or no symptoms) 
and showed increases in several parameters of functional status for both of these patient cohort subgroups, versus 
nonexercising controls, after 6 months,88 with improvement maintained at 12 months.94
As with supervised exercise programs, despite proven benefit, initiating and maintaining a high level of adherence to 
community- or home-based exercise programs remains challenging. Studies that have incorporated behavioral change 
techniques, such as health coaching and activity tracking used in supervised settings, appear to reduce attrition 
and promote higher levels of adherence, thereby improving functional and QoL outcomes, both short term and long 
term.49,88,94

In patients with claudication, alternative strategies of exercise therapy, including upper-body ergometry, 
cycling, and pain-free or low-intensity walking that avoids moderate-to-maximum claudication while 
walking, can be beneficial to improve walking ability and functional status.39,215,219,220
See Online Data 
Supplements 32 and 
33.
Protocols for exercise therapy for PAD traditionally have recommended intermittent walking bouts to moderate or higher 
pain levels interspersed with short periods of rest. Although these protocols are efficacious, intolerance of pain may lead to 
poor exercise adherence. An increasing number of studies have shown that modalities of exercise that avoid claudication 
or walking performed at intensities that are pain free or produce only mild levels of claudication can achieve health benefits 
comparable to walking at moderate or higher levels of claudication pain.39,41,215,219–221

Some RCTs have suggested that patient education may help reduce the incidence of serious foot ulcers and lower 
extremity amputations, but the quality of evidence supporting patient education is low.222 Educational efforts generally 
include teaching patients about healthy foot behaviors (eg, daily inspection of feet, wearing of shoes and socks; avoidance 
of barefoot walking), the selection of proper footwear, and the importance of seeking medical attention for new foot 
problems.223 Educational efforts are especially important for patients with PAD who have diabetes mellitus with peripheral

In patients with PAD, prompt diagnosis and treatment of foot infection are recommended to avoid 
amputation.224–228
See Online Data

Foot infections (infection of any of the structures distal to the malleoli) may include cellulitis, abscess, fasciitis, 
tenosynovitis, septic joint space infection, and osteomyelitis. Studies have investigated the accuracy of physical findings 
for identification of infection and determining infection severity and risk of amputation.224–226 Because of the consequences 
associated with untreated foot infection—especially in the presence of PAD—clinicians should maintain a high index of 
suspicion.228 It is also recognized that the presence of diabetes mellitus with peripheral neuropathy and PAD may make 
the presentation of foot infection more subtle than in patients without these problems. Foot infection should be suspected 
if the patient presents with local pain or tenderness; periwound erythema; periwound edema, induration or fluctuance; 
pretibial edema; any discharge (especially purulent); foul odor; visible bone or a wound that probes-to-bone; or signs of a 
systemic inflammatory response (including temperature >38°C or <36°C, heart rate >90/min, respiratory rate >20/min 
or Paco2 <32 mm Hg, white blood cell count >12 000 or <4000/mcL or >10% immature forms).226 Probe-to-bone test is

The EuroDIALE (European Study Group on Diabetes and the Lower Extremity) study demonstrated that the presence 
of both PAD and foot infection conferred a nearly 3-fold higher risk of leg amputation than either infection or PAD 
alone.228 The treatment of deep soft-tissue infection typically requires prompt surgical drainage; vascular imaging and 
expeditious revascularization generally follow. Experienced clinical teams have reported very good outcomes when this is 
performed in a coordinated and timely fashion.229,230 Previous groups have described various combinations of functions 
of interdisciplinary care teams (See Online Data Supplement 34a for a complete list of functions). See Section 9.2 for 
recommendations related to the role of the interdisciplinary care team in wound healing therapies for CLI.

 Program can be standalone or within a cardiac rehabilitation program.
 Program is directly supervised by qualified healthcare provider(s).
 Training is performed for a minimum of 30–45 min/session; sessions are performed at least 3 times/wk for a minimum of 12 wk.36–46
 Training involves intermittent bouts of walking to moderate-to-maximum claudication, alternating with periods of rest.
 Warm-up and cool-down periods precede and follow each session of walking.
Structured community- or home-based exercise program (COR IIa, LOE A)
 Program takes place in the personal setting of the patient rather than in a clinical setting.41,47–51
 Program is self-directed with guidance of healthcare providers.
 Healthcare providers prescribe an exercise regimen similar to that of a supervised program.
  
Patient counseling ensures understanding of how to begin and maintain the program and how to progress the difficulty of the walking (by 
increasing distance or speed).
 Program may incorporate behavioral change techniques, such as health coaching or use of activity monitors.

8. REVASCULARIZATION FOR CLAUDICATION
An individualized approach to revascularization for claudi-
cation is recommended for each patient to optimize out-
come� Revascularization is but one component of care for 
the patient with claudication, as each patient should have 
a customized care plan that also includes medical therapy 
(Section 5), structured exercise therapy (Section 6), and 
care to minimize tissue loss (Section 7)� If a strategy of 
revascularization for claudication is undertaken, the revas-
cularization strategy should be evidence based and can 
include endovascular revascularization, surgery, or both�
Because of the variability of ischemic limb symptoms 
and impact of these symptoms on functional status and 
QoL, patients should be selected for revascularization on 
the basis of severity of their symptoms� Factors to con-
sider include a significant disability as assessed by the 
patient, adequacy of response to medical and structured 
exercise therapy, status of comorbid conditions, and a fa-
vorable risk–benefit ratio� Patient preferences and goals 
of care are important considerations in the evaluation for 
revascularization� The revascularization strategy should 
have a reasonable likelihood of providing durable relief 
of symptoms� A general recommendation for revascu-
larization as a treatment option for claudication is pro-
vided below followed by specific recommendations for 
endovascular (Section 8�1�1) and surgical (Section 8�1�2) 
procedures if a revascularization strategy is undertaken�

Although there are limited data to support patient education about self–foot examination and foot care for patients with diabetes 
mellitus, there are no data that have evaluated this practice in a population of patients with PAD but without diabetes mellitus. 
Nonetheless, this is a very low-risk intervention with potential for benefit. Educational efforts generally include teaching patients about 
healthy foot behaviors (eg, daily inspection of feet; foot care and hygiene, including appropriate toenail cutting strategies; avoidance of 
barefoot walking), the selection of appropriately fitting shoes, and the importance of seeking medical attention for new foot problems.223

Revascularization is a reasonable treatment option for the patient with lifestyle-limiting claudication with an 
inadequate response to GDMT.12,37,38,232,233

A minority of patients with claudication (estimated at <10% to 15% over 5 years or more) will progress to CLI.234–237 
Therefore, the role of revascularization in claudication is improvement in claudication symptoms and functional status, and 
consequently in QoL, rather than limb salvage. Revascularization is reasonable when the patient who is being treated with 
GDMT (including structured exercise therapy) presents with persistent lifestyle-limiting claudication.12,37,38,232,233 Lifestyle-
limiting claudication is defined by the patient rather than by any test. It includes impairment of activities of daily living and/
or vocational and/or recreational activities due to claudication. There should be clear discussion with the patient about 
expected risks and benefits of revascularization, as well as discussion of the durability of proposed procedures.

Endovascular techniques to treat claudication include 
balloon dilation (angioplasty), stents, and atherectomy� 
These techniques continue to involve and now include 
covered stents, drug-eluting stents (DES), cutting bal-
loons, and drug-coated balloons� The technique chosen 
for endovascular treatment is related to lesion charac-
teristics (eg, anatomic location, lesion length, degree of 
calcification) and operator experience� Assessment of 
the appropriateness of specific endovascular techniques 
for specific lesions for the treatment of claudication is 
beyond the scope of this document�
Revascularization is performed on lesions that are 
deemed to be hemodynamically significant, and stenoses 
selected for endovascular treatment should have a reason-
able likelihood of limiting perfusion to the distal limb� Ste-
noses of 50% to 75% diameter by angiography may not 
be hemodynamically significant, and resting or provoked 
intravascular pressure measurements may be used to de-
termine whether lesions are significant�238,239 Multiple RCTs 
have compared endovascular procedures to various com-

Two separate systematic analyses that included RCTs that enrolled patients with aortoiliac disease reported that 
endovascular treatment of claudication improved walking parameters and QoL.11,12,233 The CLEVER trial enrolled only 
patients with aortoiliac disease and compared endovascular therapy to supervised exercise therapy and to medications 
alone.37,38 At 6-month follow-up, both the endovascular therapy and supervised exercise groups had improved peak 
walking time compared with medication alone, with a greater improvement in the supervised exercise group.37 By 18 
months, there was no significant difference between the endovascular therapy and supervised exercise groups, with 
a sustained benefit versus medication alone.38 Other RCTs that included patients with aortoiliac disease have shown 
QoL, as assessed by questionnaires and time to onset of claudication, may be superior with endovascular treatment 
in combination with a medical and an exercise treatment plan, compared versus medical treatment alone.232,233,246 The 
ERASE trial randomized patients with claudication and aortoiliac (as well as femoropopliteal) disease to endovascular 
revascularization plus supervised exercise or supervised exercise alone. After 1 year, patients in both groups had 
significant improvements in walking distances and health-related QoL, with greater improvements in the combined-
therapy group.218 The long-term comparative efficacy of endovascular revascularization versus supervised exercise 
therapy and medical therapy compared to supervised exercise therapy and medical therapy without revascularization for 
aortoiliac disease is unknown.

Multiple RCTs have demonstrated short-term efficacy with endovascular treatment of femoropopliteal

disease, reported that endovascular treatment of claudication improved walking parameters and QoL.11,12,233 The 
durability of endovascular treatment for claudication is directly related to vessel patency. Long-term patency is 
greater in the iliac artery than in the femoropopliteal segment. Furthermore, durability is diminished with greater 
lesion length, occlusion rather than stenosis, the presence of multiple and diffuse lesions, poor-quality runoff, 
diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, renal failure, and smoking.252–255 The choice of endovascular therapy as a 
revascularization approach for claudication due to femoropopliteal disease therefore should include a discussion of 
outcomes, addressing the risk of restenosis and repeat intervention, particularly for lesions with poor likelihood of 
long-term durability.

The usefulness of endovascular procedures as a revascularization option for patients with claudication due to 
isolated infrapopliteal artery disease is unknown.256–258

Isolated infrapopliteal disease is unlikely to cause claudication. Incidence of in-stent restenosis is high and long-
term benefit lacking with bare-metal stenting of the infrapopliteal arteries.256 Studies that have enrolled patients with 
claudication as well as CLI have demonstrated a benefit of DES versus bare-metal stents or versus drug-coated balloons 
for revascularization of infrapopliteal lesions.257,258 However, these differences were mainly for patency and restenosis 
endpoints, and neither of these studies included patient-oriented outcomes, such as walking function or QoL parameters. 
Additional efficacy data on the use of infrapopliteal drug-coated balloon or DES for the treatment of claudication are likely to 
be published in the near future.

There are no data to support a practice paradigm of performing endovascular procedures on patients with PAD for the purpose

induced nephropathy, and the possibility of adverse limb outcomes.259–261 Therefore, the known risks of endovascular procedures

The superficial femoral and proximal popliteal arteries are the most common anatomic sites of stenosis or occlusion among 
individuals with claudication. Femoral-popliteal bypass is therefore one of the most common surgical procedures for claudication 
and may be performed under general or regional anesthesia. The type of conduit and site of popliteal artery anastomosis (above 
versus below knee) are major determinants of outcomes associated with femoral-popliteal bypass. Systematic reviews and meta-
analyses have identified a clear and consistent primary patency benefit for autogenous vein versus to prosthetic grafts for popliteal 
artery bypass.270,271 Prosthetic grafts to the popliteal artery above the knee have reduced patency rates and increased rates of 
repeat intervention.263,266,269,272 Sparse evidence suggests a long-term patency advantage for Dacron over polytetrafluoroethylene

Systematic reviews have concluded that surgical procedures are an effective treatment for claudication and have a positive 
impact on QoL and walking parameters but have identified sparse evidence supporting the effectiveness of surgery 
compared with other treatments.11,233,278,279 Although symptom and patency outcomes for surgical interventions may be 
superior versus less invasive endovascular treatments for specific patients, surgical interventions are also associated with 
greater risk of adverse perioperative events.280–286 Treatment selection should therefore be individualized on the basis of 
the patient’s goals, perioperative risk, and anticipated benefit. Surgical procedures for claudication are usually reserved for 
individuals who a) do not derive adequate benefit from nonsurgical therapy, b) have arterial anatomy favorable to obtaining 
a durable result with surgery, and c) have acceptable risk of perioperative adverse events. Acceptable risk is defined by 
the individual patient and provider on the basis of symptom severity, comorbid conditions, and appropriate GDMT risk 
evaluation. Guidelines for the evaluation and management of patients undergoing noncardiac surgery, including vascular

Patients with CLI are at high risk of major cardiovascular ischemic events, as well as nonhealing wounds and major 
amputation. In a systematic review of 13 studies of patients with CLI who did not receive revascularization, which 
included patients enrolled in medical and angiogenic therapy trials, there was a 22% all-cause mortality rate and a 22% 
rate of major amputation at a median follow-up of 12 months.290 The goal of surgical or endovascular revascularization 
is to provide in-line blood flow to the foot through at least 1 patent artery, which will help decrease ischemic pain and 
allow healing of any wounds, while preserving a functional limb. Multiple RCTs comparing contemporary surgical and 
endovascular treatment for patients with CLI are ongoing.15–17 Revascularization is not warranted in the setting of a

Patients with CLI should be evaluated by an interdisciplinary care team. Before amputation, evaluation generally

Endovascular procedures are recommended to establish in-line blood flow to the foot in patients with 
nonhealing wounds or gangrene.292,293
See Online Data 
Supplement 39.
The technique chosen for endovascular treatment of CLI is related to anatomic location of lesions, lesion 
characteristics, and operator experience. Revascularization is performed on hemodynamically significant stenoses 
that are likely to be limiting blood flow to the limb. For stenoses of 50% to 75%, where the hemodynamic 
significance is unclear, intravascular pressure measurements may be used to determine hemodynamic 
significance.294 The BASIL (Bypass versus Angioplasty in Severe Ischemia of the Leg) RCT demonstrated that 
endovascular revascularization is an effective option for patients with CLI as compared with open surgery.292,293 The 
primary endpoint of amputation-free survival was the same in the endovascular and surgical arms. Of note, the 
endovascular arm used only PTA.292,293 Multiple RCTs comparing contemporary surgical and endovascular treatment

A staged approach to endovascular procedures is reasonable in patients with ischemic  
rest pain.295,296
N/A
For patients with multilevel disease who suffer from ischemic rest pain, in-flow lesions are generally addressed first.295,296 
Depending on procedural characteristics, including contrast volume used, radiation exposure, and procedure time, out-flow 
lesions can be addressed in the same setting or at a later time if symptoms persist. This strategy for ischemic rest pain 
is distinct from the strategy recommended for CLI in the patient with a nonhealing wound or gangrene. In that scenario, 
restoration of direct in-line flow to the foot is essential for wound healing.

Evaluation of lesion characteristics can be useful in selecting the endovascular approach  
for CLI.297,298
See Online Data 
Supplement 39.
The lesion characteristics to consider include length, anatomic location, and extent of occlusive disease. For example, 
if an adequate angioplasty result can be achieved with PTA alone for short (<10 cm) stenoses in the femoropopliteal 
segment, then stent placement is not necessary.297,298 Presence of thrombosis or calcification at the lesion site will 
also affect the endovascular approach. In general, the advantages of DES and drug-coated balloons over PTA alone or 
bare-metal stents are more consistent in the femoropopliteal segment than for infrapopliteal interventions.257,258,299–309 
However, these differences are mainly for patency, restenosis, and repeat-revascularization endpoints. Most studies 
were underpowered or did not examine other patient-oriented outcomes, such as amputation or wound healing in CLI. 
Endovascular techniques continue to evolve rapidly, and there has been limited literature comparing techniques with 
regard to clinically significant outcomes, such as amputation or wound healing.

Findings That Favor Consideration of Endovascular Revascularization
Examples
  
The presence of patient comorbidities may place patients at 
increased risk of perioperative complications from surgical 
revascularization. In these patients, an endovascular-first 
approach should be used regardless of anatomy
  
Patient comorbidities, including coronary ischemia, cardiomyopathy, 
congestive heart failure, severe lung disease, and chronic kidney disease
  
Patients with rest pain and disease at multiple levels may undergo 
a staged approach as part of endovascular-first approach
  
In-flow disease can be addressed first, and out-flow disease can be 
addressed in a staged manner, when required, if clinical factors or patient 
safety prevent addressing all diseased segments at one setting
  
Patients without suitable autologous vein for bypass grafts
  
Some patients have had veins harvested for previous coronary artery 
bypass surgery and do not have adequate remaining veins for use as 
conduits. Similarly, patients may not have undergone prior saphenous vein 
harvest, but available vein is of inadequate diameter

Use of angiosome-directed endovascular therapy may be reasonable for patients with CLI and nonhealing 
wounds or gangrene.310–319
See Online Data 
Supplements 39 and 
40.
During the past decade, the goal of care with regard to endovascular therapy for the treatment of nonhealing wounds due to 
CLI has been establishment of direct in-line blood flow to the affected limb. The angiosome concept has also been described 
in the literature in relation to the treatment of nonhealing wounds. Angiosome-directed treatment entails establishing direct 
blood flow to the infrapopliteal artery directly responsible for perfusing the region of the leg or foot with the nonhealing wound. 
Multiple retrospective studies and 1 small nonrandomized prospective study assessing the efficacy of this concept have been 
published.119,310–321 Meta-analyses of these studies found improved wound healing and limb salvage with angiosome-guided 
therapy but cautioned that the quality of the evidence was low.322,323 Although the angiosome concept is theoretically satisfying, 
randomized data comparing the establishment of in-line flow versus angiosome-guided therapy have yet to be published. 
Furthermore, there is no evidence yet to demonstrate the potential benefit of treating additional infrapopliteal arteries once 
in-line flow has been established in one artery, regardless of angiosome. Important considerations with regard to angiosome-
guided therapy include the potential for longer procedural times, more contrast exposure, and more technically complex 
procedures. The impact of all these factors needs to be weighed against the likelihood of a technically successful procedure 
providing hypothetical added benefit over the establishment of in-line blood flow.

When surgery is performed for CLI, bypass to the popliteal or infrapopliteal arteries (ie, tibial, pedal) should 
be constructed with suitable autogenous vein.263,266,269,272

Many large RCTs have demonstrated that bypasses above the knee should be autogenous vein either reversed or in situ 
vein.263,266,269,272 There are large single-center trials showing the efficacy of autogenous vein to distal tibial vessels.324,325 In 
addition, composite sequential femoropopliteal-tibial bypass and bypass to an isolated popliteal arterial segment that has 
collateral out flow to the foot are both acceptable methods of revascularization and should be considered when no other 
form of bypass with adequate autogenous conduit is possible.326,327

An interdisciplinary care team should evaluate and provide comprehensive care for patients with CLI and 
tissue loss to achieve complete wound healing and a functional foot.229,339–341
See Online Data 
Supplement 44.
The management of patients with CLI and nonhealing wounds should include coordinated efforts for both revascularization 
and wound healing, because the risk of limb-threatening infections remains until complete wound healing is achieved. 
The structure and activities of interdisciplinary care teams for CLI may vary according to several factors, including the 
local availability of resources. Previous groups have described various combinations of activities of this team, which are in 
addition to revascularization and include functions such as wound care, infection management, orthotics, and prosthetics 
(see Online Data Supplement 34a for a complete list of functions). Coordination of these activities and some degree of 
organized team structure are recommended, as opposed to ad hoc or unstructured referrals among various specialty 
clinicians not involved in interdisciplinary care.
Ambulatory patients with PAD and nonhealing foot ulcers should be considered for efforts to prevent amputation. The 
components of this effort may include revascularization, offloading, treatment of infection, and wound care. The long-term 
outcome of the limb is excellent when complete wound healing can be achieved.339Revascularization should be coordinated 
with the efforts of clinicians who manage foot infections, provide offloading, and achieve complete wound healing, either 
through medical therapy, surgical options, or a combination thereof. Coordinated and timely interdisciplinary care can 
achieve excellent limb outcomes for patients with PAD and nonhealing foot wounds.229,339–341

In patients with CLI, wound care after revascularization should be performed with the goal of complete

A comprehensive plan for treatment of CLI must include a plan for achieving an intact skin surface on a functional foot. One 
study demonstrated a limb salvage rate of 100% at 3 years in a cohort of patients with CLI who achieved complete wound 
healing with endovascular revascularization and dedicated wound care.339 Before revascularization, the interdisciplinary 
care team should devise a plan to achieve the goal of complete wound healing. After successful revascularization, most 
patients with gangrene of the foot are evaluated for minor amputation with staged/delayed primary closure or surgical 
reconstruction when feasible.342–344 Negative-pressure wound therapy dressings are helpful to achieve wound healing 
after revascularization and minor (ie, digit or partial foot) amputation when primary or delayed secondary closure is not 
feasible.345,346 Spontaneous amputation, or autoamputation, of gangrenous digits should be reserved for palliation in 
patients without options for revascularization.345,347,348
Other evidence-based guidelines relevant to those with nonhealing foot wounds following revascularization cover the full 
spectrum of diabetic foot problems349 or separately consider the management of infection,225,350 offloading,351 and wound 
care.352 To date, there are no RCTs or high-quality studies that have focused on wound healing adjuncts in limbs with 
severe PAD (eg, topical cytokine ointments, skin substitutes, cell-based therapies intended to optimize wound healing).

reconstruction, depending on lesion characteristics, patient comorbidities, and patient preference.337,338 Combined 
percutaneous and surgical revascularization may require separate interventions, typically with the most proximal procedure 
performed first.

10. MANAGEMENT OF ALI
ALI is one of the most treatable and potentially devastat-
ing presentations of PAD� Timely recognition of arterial 
occlusion as the cause of an ischemic, cold, painful leg 
is crucial to successful treatment� The writing commit-
tee has used a standard definition of ALI in which symp-
tom duration is <2 weeks (Table 3)�33,34 Category I refers 
to viable limbs that are not immediately threatened� Cat-
egory II refers to threatened limbs� Category IIa limbs 
are marginally threatened and salvageable, if promptly 
treated� Category IIb are immediately threatened limbs 
that require immediate revascularization if salvage is to 
be accomplished� Category III are irreversibly damaged 
limbs, in which case resultant major tissue loss or per-
manent nerve damage is inevitable�34

In patients with CLI, intermittent pneumatic compression (arterial pump) devices may be considered to 
augment wound healing and/or ameliorate severe ischemic rest pain.353
See Online Data 
Supplement 44.
A systematic review of studies that used intermittent pneumatic compression devices specifically designed to augment 
arterial perfusion of the lower extremities suggests that these may provide modest clinical benefit (specifically, decreased 
amputation rates and improved QoL) in patients with CLI who were ineligible for revascularization.353 The potential benefit 
appears to outweigh the low risk associated with the use of these devices.

In patients with CLI, the effectiveness of hyperbaric oxygen therapy for wound healing is unknown.354
See Online Data 
Supplement 44.
The literature evaluating the utility of hyperbaric oxygen therapy has focused on patients without severe PAD and has 
not demonstrated a long-term benefit on wound healing or improving amputation-free survival when compared with 
sham treatment.355 There are no published studies evaluating the role of hyperbaric oxygen therapy for patients with 
nonreconstructible PAD. One small RCT that focused on patients with foot ulcers and PAD (ABI <0.80 or TBI <0.70) for 
whom no revascularization was planned demonstrated a significant decrease in ulcer area at 6 weeks, but no significant 
differences in ulcer size at 6 months, complete ulcer healing at 6 weeks or 6 months, and major or minor amputations.354 
Further research on the utility of hyperbaric oxygen therapy in this context is needed.

Patients with ALI should be emergently evaluated by a clinician with sufficient experience to assess limb 
viability and implement appropriate therapy.
N/A
Patients with ALI should be rapidly evaluated by a vascular specialist if one is available. Depending on local clinical 
expertise, the vascular specialist may be a vascular surgeon, interventional radiologist, cardiologist, or a general surgeon 
with specialized training and experience in treating PAD. If such expertise is not locally or rapidly available, there should be 
strong consideration of transfer of the patient to a facility with such resources. The more advanced the degree of ischemia, 
the more rapidly the communication (including communication about potential patient transfer) needs to occur.

In patients with suspected ALI, initial clinical evaluation should rapidly assess limb viability and potential for 
salvage and does not require imaging.357–361
See Online Data 
Supplements 45 and 
46.
ALI is a medical emergency and must be recognized rapidly. The time constraint is due to the period that skeletal muscle 
will tolerate ischemia—roughly 4 to 6 hours.362 A rapid assessment of limb viability and ability to restore arterial blood flow 
should be performed by a clinician able to either complete the revascularization or triage the patient.358 Lower extremity 
symptoms in ALI can include both pain and loss of function. The longer these symptoms are present, the less likely the 
possibility of limb salvage.360,361 Clinical assessment must include symptom duration, pain intensity, and motor and sensory 
deficit severity to distinguish a threatened from a nonviable extremity (Figure 3). The bedside assessment should include 
arterial and venous examination with a handheld continuous-wave Doppler because of the inaccuracy of pulse palpation.34 
The loss of dopplerable arterial signal indicates that the limb is threatened. The absence of both arterial and venous 
Doppler signal indicates that the limb may be irreversibly damaged (nonsalvageable). Comorbidities should be investigated 
and managed aggressively, but this must not delay therapy. Even in the setting of rapid and effective revascularization, the 
1-year morbidity and mortality rates associated with ALI are high.360,363

Heparin (generally intravenous unfractionated heparin) is given to all patients acutely.35,364 This can stop thrombus propagation 
and may provide an anti-inflammatory effect that lessens the ischemia. Patients who have received heparin before the onset 
of ALI and have a decrease in platelet count may have heparin-induced thrombocytopenia.365,366 In this situation, a direct 
thrombin inhibitor is given, rather than heparin, if heparin-induced thrombocytopenia with thrombosis is suspected.

In patients with ALI, the revascularization strategy should be determined by local resources and patient 
factors (eg, etiology and degree of ischemia).367–369
See Online Data 
Supplement 47.
For marginally or immediately threatened limbs (Category IIa and IIb ALI [Figure 3]), revascularization should be performed 
emergently (within 6 hours). For viable limbs (Category I ALI [Figure 3]), revascularization should be performed an on urgent basis 
(within 6–24 hours). The revascularization strategy can range from catheter-directed thrombolysis to surgical thromboembolectomy. 
Available facilities and clinical expertise are factors that should be considered when determining the revascularization strategy. The 
technique that will provide the most rapid restoration of arterial flow with the least risk to the patient should be selected. For example, 
catheter-directed thrombolysis can provide rapid restoration of arterial flow to a viable or marginally threatened limb, particularly in 
the setting of recent occlusion, thrombosis of synthetic grafts, and stent thrombosis.367 If this is not available locally, surgical options 
for timely revascularization should be considered, along with the feasibility of timely transfer to a facility with the necessary expertise.

Catheter-based thrombolysis is effective for patients with ALI and a salvageable limb.367–371

Assessment of the comparative effectiveness of catheter-based thrombolysis versus open surgery is complicated by 
variable definitions of ALI in this literature. Four RCTs comparing catheter-based thrombolysis to surgery,367,369–371 as well 
as a meta-analysis,368 have demonstrated similar limb salvage rates between the 2 approaches but better survival with 
catheter-based therapy. The survival advantage of catheter-based therapy may be at least in part attributable to multiple 
comorbidities found among the population of patients who present with ALI. Increased comorbidities are likely to contribute 
to increased perioperative risk. Several of the RCTs included patients with relatively chronic ischemia. Acuity and severity 
are both factors in the decision to consider thrombolysis.367,369–371

Amputation should be performed as the first procedure in patients with a nonsalvageable limb.372,373
See Online Data 
Supplement 48.
For patients with Category III ALI (Figure 3), amputation should be performed as the index procedure. Prolonged duration 
of ischemia is the most common factor in patients requiring amputation for treatment of ALI. The risks associated with 
reconstruction outweigh the potential benefit in a limb that is already insensate or immobile because of prolonged ischemia. 
Patients who have an insensate and immobile limb in the setting of prolonged ischemia (>6 to 8 hours) are unlikely to have 
potential for limb salvage.34,362 In addition, in this setting the reperfusion and circulation of ischemic metabolites can result 
in multiorgan failure and cardiovascular collapse. However, if pain can be controlled and there is no evidence of infection, 
amputation may be deferred if this meets with the patient’s goals.

Patients with ALI should be monitored and treated (eg, fasciotomy) for compartment syndrome after 
revascularization.372,373
See Online Data 
Supplement 48.
The lower extremity muscles reside in compartments, surrounded by fascia and bones. Reperfusion to ischemic muscles 
can cause cellular edema, resulting in increased compartment pressure. When compartment pressure is >30 mm Hg, 
there is capillary and venule compression that leads to malperfusion of the muscle; this is compartment syndrome. 
Fasciotomy is indicated when the compartment pressure increases. Measurement of intracompartment pressure is not 
always easily accessible. In such cases, evaluation for fasciotomy is prompted by development of increased pain, tense 
muscle, or nerve injury. Fasciotomy should be considered for patients with Category IIb ischemia for whom the time to 
revascularization is >4 hours.

Duplex graft surveillance focuses on the identification of high-grade stenosis (eg, peak systolic velocity >300 cm/s and peak 
systolic velocity ratio across the stenosis >3.5) or impending graft failure (eg, PSV <40 cm/s).392,395 Detection of a graft 
stenosis prompts the consideration of further revascularization to treat the stenosis and maintain graft patency. Duplex may 
detect significant stenoses that may not be detected by a decline in ABI.394 Although case series have demonstrated high

12. EVIDENCE GAPS AND FUTURE RESEARCH 
DIRECTIONS
In performing the evidence review and in developing the 
present guidelines, the writing committee identified the 
following critical evidence gaps and future directions for 
PAD-related research:
• Basic science and translational studies to better 
understand the vascular biology of endovascu-
lar therapies and bypass grafting and to develop 
new methods for preventing restenosis after 
revascularization�
• Determination of risk factors for progression from 
asymptomatic PAD to symptomatic disease, includ-
ing CLI�
• RCTs needed to determine the value of using the 
ABI to identify asymptomatic patients with PAD for 
therapies to reduce cardiovascular risk (eg, anti-
platelet agents, statins, and other therapies)�
• Advancement in PAD diagnostics, such as technolo-
gies for simplified yet highly accurate measurement 
of the ABI and tools for more reliable noninvasive 
perfusion assessment in CLI�
• Comparative-effectiveness studies to determine 
the optimal antiplatelet therapy (drug or drugs and 
dosage) for prevention of cardiovascular and limb-
related events in patients with PAD�
• Development of additional medical therapies for 
claudication–an area of unmet medical need with a 
currently limited research pipeline�404
• Studies to investigate the role of dietary interven-
tion, in addition to statin therapy, to improve out-
come and modify the natural history of PAD�
• Additional research to identify the best community- 
or home-based exercise programs for patients with 
PAD to maximize functional status and improve 
QoL, as well as the role of such exercise programs 
before or in addition to revascularization�
• Development and validation of improved clinical 
classification systems for PAD that incorporate 
symptoms, anatomic factors, and patient-specific 
risk factors and can be used to predict clinical out-
come and optimize treatment approach� An example 
of a recently developed classification system is the 
Society for Vascular Surgery limb classification sys-
tem, based on wound, ischemia, and foot infection 
(WIfI), which has been validated in different popula-
tions and may permit more meaningful prognosis in 
patients with CLI�405–409
• Comparative- and cost-effectiveness studies of the 
different endovascular technologies for treatment of 
claudication and CLI, including drug-coated balloons 
and DES� Studies should include patient-centered end-
points, such as functional parameters, time to wound 
healing, and QoL, in addition to standard patency-
focused outcomes� These studies could then be 
incorporated into value-based clinical algorithms for 
approach to revascularization for claudication and CLI�
• Additional studies to demonstrate the impact 
of multisocietal registries on clinical outcomes 
and appropriate use� At present, these include 
the Vascular Quality Initiative (VQI), the National 
Cardiovascular Data Registry Peripheral Vascular 
Intervention Registry™ (PVI Registry™), and the 
National Radiology Data Registry for Interventional 
Radiology (NRDR)� These registries provide an 
opportunity to obtain “real-world” data on surgi-
cal and endovascular procedures for PAD and to 
improve quality by providing feedback to participat-
ing centers� Future efforts should incorporate these 
registries into interventional RCTs and postmarket-
ing studies of PAD-related devices�
13. ADVOCACY PRIORITIES
The writing committee identified 3 priorities for multi-
societal advocacy initiatives to improve health care for 
patients with PAD� First, the writing committee supports 
the availability of the ABI as the initial diagnostic test 
to establish the diagnosis of PAD in patients with his-
tory or physical examination findings suggestive of PAD 
(Table 5)� Although the ABI test is generally reimbursed 
by third-party payers for patients with classic claudica-
tion or lower extremity wounds, payers may not provide 
reimbursement for the ABI with other findings sugges-
tive of PAD, such as lower extremity pulse abnormali-
ties or femoral bruits� The writing committee affirms the 
importance of confirming the diagnosis of PAD in such 
patients to allow for GDMT as delineated in this docu-
ment� Second, the writing committee supports the vital 
importance of insuring access to supervised exercise 
programs for patients with PAD� Although extensive high-
quality evidence supports supervised exercise programs 
to improve functional status and QoL, only a minority of 
patients with PAD participate in such programs because 
of lack of reimbursement by third-party payers� Third, 
the writing committee recognizes the need for incorpo-
ration of patient-centered outcomes into the process of 
regulatory approval of new medical therapies and revas-
cularization technologies� For revascularization tech-
nologies, regulatory approval is driven primarily by data 
on angiographic efficacy (ie, target lesion patency) and 
safety endpoints� The nature of the functional limitation 
associated with PAD warrants the incorporation of pa-
tient-centered outcomes, such as functional parameters 
and QoL, into the efficacy outcomes for the approval 
process�

This table represents the relationships of committee members with industry and other entities that were determined to be relevant to this document. 
These relationships were reviewed and updated in conjunction with all meetings and/or conference calls of the writing committee during the document 
development process. The table does not necessarily reflect relationships with industry at the time of publication. A person is deemed to have a significant 
interest in a business if the interest represents ownership of ≥5% of the voting stock or share of the business entity, or ownership of ≥$5000 of the fair 
market value of the business entity; or if funds received by the person from the business entity exceed 5% of the person’s gross income for the previous 
year. Relationships that exist with no financial benefit are also included for the purpose of transparency. Relationships in this table are modest unless 
otherwise noted. According to the ACC/AHA, a person has a relevant relationship IF: a) the relationship or interest relates to the same or similar subject 
matter, intellectual property or asset, topic, or issue addressed in the document; or b) the company/entity (with whom the relationship exists) makes a 
drug, drug class, or device addressed in the document, or makes a competing drug or device addressed in the document; or c) the person or a member 
of the person’s household, has a reasonable potential for financial, professional, or other personal gain or loss as a result of the issues/content addressed 
in the document.
*Writing committee members are required to recuse themselves from voting on sections to which their specific relationships with industry and other 
entities may apply.
†Significant relationship.
‡No financial benefit.
ACC indicates American College of Cardiology; AHA, American Heart Association; DSMB, data safety monitoring board; and VA, Veterans Affairs.

This table represents all relationships of reviewers with industry and other entities that were reported by authors, including those not deemed to be relevant to this document, at the 
time this document was under development. The table does not necessarily reflect relationships with industry at the time of publication. A person is deemed to have a significant interest 
in a business if the interest represents ownership of ≥5% of the voting stock or share of the business entity, or ownership of ≥$5000 of the fair market value of the business entity; or if 
funds received by the person from the business entity exceed 5% of the person’s gross income for the previous year. Relationships that exist with no financial benefit are also included 
for the purpose of transparency. Relationships in this table are modest unless otherwise noted. Please refer to http://www.acc.org/guidelines/about-guidelines-and-clinical-documents/
