Objective. Estimates of the incidence and prevalence
of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in the US have
varied widely. The purpose of this study was to conduct
the California Lupus Surveillance Project (CLSP) to
determine credible estimates of SLE incidence and preva-
lence, with a special focus on Hispanics and Asians.
Methods. The CLSP, which is funded by the Cen-
ters for Disease Control and Prevention, is a population-
based registry of individuals with SLE residing in San
Francisco County, CA, from January 1, 2007 through
December 31, 2009. Data sources included hospitals, rheu-
matologists, nephrologists, commercial laboratories, and a
state hospital discharge database. We abstracted medical
records to ascertain SLE cases, which we defined as
patients who met ‡4 of the 11 American College of
Rheumatology classification criteria for SLE. We esti-
mated crude and age-standardized incidence and preva-
lence, which were stratified by sex and race/ethnicity.
Results. The
overall
age-standardized
annual
incidence rate was 4.6 per 100,000 person-years. The
average annual period prevalence was 84.8 per 100,000
persons. The age-standardized incidence rate in women
and men was 8.6 and 0.7 per 100,000 person-years,
respectively. This rate was highest among black women
(30.5), followed by Hispanic women (8.9), Asian women
(7.2), and white women (5.3). The age-standardized
prevalence in women per 100,000 persons was 458.1 in
blacks, 177.9 in Hispanics, 149.7 in Asians, and 109.8 in
whites. Capture–recapture modeling estimated 33 addi-
tional incident cases and 147 additional prevalent cases.
Conclusion. Comprehensive
methods
that
in-
clude intensive case-finding provide more credible esti-
mates of SLE in Hispanics and Asians, and confirm
racial and ethnic disparities in SLE. The disease
burden of SLE is highest in black women, followed by
Hispanic women, Asian women, and white women.
Historical estimates of the incidence and preva-
lence of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in the US
have varied widely (1). These differences stem from a
variety of factors, including the definition of SLE used,
completeness of case ascertainment, geographic area,
and racial/ethnic composition of the study population.
The heterogeneity of disease manifestations and the
lack of an accurate, reliable diagnostic test result in sub-
stantial challenges and costs of conducting large-scale
epidemiologic studies in SLE. In an effort to develop
more authoritative estimates of the incidence and preva-
lence of SLE, the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC) initially provided funding for 2
population-based
lupus
surveillance
registries:
the
Georgia Lupus Registry and the Michigan Lupus Epide-
miology and Surveillance Program. These 2 registries,
which were focused primarily on whites and blacks, have
been successfully finished (2,3). To increase the reliabil-
ity of SLE estimates in other racial/ethnic groups, the
CDC funded 2 similar registries, one in California and the

 other in New York, to focus on Hispanics and Asians, and
a third registry with the Indian Health Service to focus on
American Indians and Alaska Natives (4).
In collaboration with the CDC and the California
Department of Public Health, we conducted the Califor-
nia Lupus Surveillance Project (CLSP) to determine
contemporary, population-based estimates of the inci-
dence and prevalence of SLE in San Francisco County
during the period 2007 through 2009 using multiple
methods of case ascertainment. A secondary goal was to
describe the clinical and serologic spectrum of incident
SLE in the population. To the greatest extent possible,
we aligned our methodology with that of the Georgia
and Michigan registries (2,3) to promote consistent data
collection and optimal case ascertainment.
PATIENTS AND METHODS
The California Lupus Surveillance Project.
The
CLSP was conducted under the statutory authority of the Cali-
fornia Department of Public Health (CDPH). Patients were
not contacted for this study. A partnership between the CDPH
and the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF),
allowed medical records to be collected using the health sur-
veillance exemption to the Health Insurance Portability and
Accountability Act (HIPAA) privacy rules (45 CFR parts 160
and 164). The use of protected health information was essen-
tial in the conduct of this project in order to increase potential
case-finding, perform unbiased case ascertainment, and pre-
vent duplication of patients in the registry. The CDPH sub-
contracted with the UCSF to conduct this project. The State
of California Institutional Review Board (IRB) granted a
waiver for this public health surveillance activity, but the proj-
ect was reviewed and approved by the UCSF IRB.
Source population/catchment criteria.
The source
population consisted of residents of San Francisco County,
CA, during the period of January 1, 2007 through December
31, 2009. According to US Census estimates, the San
Francisco County source population in 2007–2009 averaged
790,582 residents, 56% of whom identified themselves as
white, 35% as Asian or Pacific Islander, 7% as black, and 1%
as American Indian/Alaska Native (5). Of note, Hispanic eth-
nicity is considered a distinct concept from race and is there-
fore collected and reported separately from race; 15% of
residents identified themselves as Hispanic ethnicity.
Case definitions. SLE is currently diagnosed in clini-
cal practice by an expert clinician based on characteristic
symptoms and signs in conjunction with supportive serologic
and histologic data. For the purposes of this surveillance proj-
ect in which clinical information was ascertained through
review of medical records, we used various case definitions to
classify a patient as having SLE. To maintain consistency with
the Georgia and Michigan Lupus Registries (2,3), we report
estimates using 2 case-finding definitions: the American Col-
lege of Rheumatology (ACR) case definition and the com-
bined case definition.
The ACR definition included patients who met $4 of
the 11 ACR revised criteria for the classification of SLE as
defined in 1982 and updated in 1997 (6,7). This is a standard
case definition used for research. The combined definition was
satisfied if a patient met any of the following 3 criteria. The
patient satisfied the ACR case-finding definition as described
above. The patient had documented SLE, as diagnosed by the
treating rheumatologist, and met 3 of the 11 ACR classifica-
tion criteria. This definition was chosen to allow for the possi-
bility of missing data and an inability to confirm criteria in the
available medical records for prevalent cases with longstanding
disease. The patient had lupus-related kidney disease, as
defined either by the presence of World Health Organization
class II–VI lupus nephritis upon biopsy or by the presence in
the medical record of a diagnosis of SLE (International Classi-
fication of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification
[ICD-9-CM] code 710.0) along with either dialysis or renal
transplantation.
Case ascertainment. The 3 primary sources of poten-
tial SLE cases were as follows: 1) community rheumatology
and nephrology clinics (office-based practices), 2) community
hospitals (nonacademic hospitals), and 3) integrated health
care systems (integrated hospitals and clinics) within the
catchment area, including the UCSF, Kaiser Permanente of
Northern California, and the San Francisco Veterans Admin-
istration Medical Center (Figure 1).
We queried these sources over the period 2000–2009
using ICD-9-CM diagnostic codes 710.0 (SLE), 695.4 (discoid
lupus), 710.8 (other specified connective tissue disease [CTD]),
and 710.9 (unspecified CTD). A secondary source was a com-
mercial laboratory, which we queried for the following serologic
tests: antinuclear antibodies, anti–double-stranded DNA anti-
bodies, anti-Sm antibodies, antiphospholipid antibodies, and
low complement levels. Another secondary source was the Cali-
fornia Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development
(OSHPD) hospital discharge database, which we queried for
discharges using the ICD-9-CM diagnostic codes 710.0 (SLE),
695.4 (discoid lupus), 710.8 (other specified CTD), and 710.9
(unspecified CTD). We added patients identified from the
OSHPD query to the roster of the appropriate primary source
hospitals and integrated health care systems.
After compiling a list of potential SLE patients from
all sources using the queries described above, we determined
catchment criteria for each patient (proof of residence in San
Francisco County during the period 2007–2009). The primary
methods
for
verifying
catchment
criteria
were
via
the
LexisNexis online database service, hospital billing databases,
and clinic medical records. We then abstracted medical
records for each of the potential SLE patients who met catch-
ment criteria to identify those whose medical record had a
physician diagnosis of SLE, possible SLE, undifferentiated/
unspecified CTD, or a related connective tissue disorder, such
as mixed CTD.
Data collection.
Four trained field staff abstracted
medical charts for each potential SLE patient who met the
catchment criteria. Training of the staff included lectures by
physicians, extensive reading about SLE clinical manifesta-
tions and terminology, and practice abstractions of patient
charts that were then reviewed in detail by the principal inves-
tigator (MD). The field abstractors accessed all available med-
ical records (paper charts and electronic medical records) at
each source location, collecting more than 200 data elements.
Laboratory records were reviewed for the presence or absence

 of antibodies and for the presence or absence of low comple-
ment levels.
The abstractors recorded whether the source was a
community clinic, community hospital, or integrated health
care system as described above. As questions arose about the
information in the medical records, the abstractors contacted
the principal investigator in real time to obtain clarifications.
Demographic information was obtained from the medical
record. For quality control, a second field abstractor and the
principal investigator reviewed 5 of every 100 charts for each
abstractor, and data entry errors identified by discordant
responses between abstractors were examined and corrected.
Overall, we calculated 98% concordance between abstractors
for the required data elements (those used to define the ACR
criteria) and 93% concordance for all other data elements.
Statistical analysis. We derived all denominators for
incidence and prevalence using the 2007–2009 San Francisco
population estimates from the revised 2000–2009 bridged-race
intercensal files (5). The average annual incidence rate (cases
per 100,000 person-years) was the number of newly diagnosed
SLE cases in persons residing in San Francisco County at the
time of SLE diagnosis (defined as the earliest date as recorded
in the medical record that the physician first stated the diagno-
sis of SLE, possible SLE, undifferentiated CTD, or mixed
CTD) during 2007–2009 divided by the sum of the annual pop-
ulation of San Francisco for 2007, 2008, and 2009. We calcu-
lated
the
annual
period
prevalence
(cases
per
100,000
persons) for each year separately, dividing the number of SLE
cases diagnosed before or during that year in persons residing
in San Francisco County during the year by the San Francisco
County population of that year. We then averaged the 3
annual prevalence estimates to yield the average annual preva-
lence for 2007–2009. Our next step was to calculate exact 95%
confidence intervals (95% CIs) (8) for the incidence rate and
average annual prevalence.
We calculated age-standardized incidence and preva-
lence using the direct method, based on the 2000 US projected
population (distribution no. 2) (9). In addition, we computed

were used: the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) definition and the combined definition (see Patients and Methods for details).

 age-specific estimates using 10-year age groups, as well as sex-
specific estimates. The intercensal database of the Census
Bureau codes race and Hispanic ethnicity using 2 variables.
One collapses all persons into 4 mutually exclusive categories
defined by bridged race, without accounting for Hispanic eth-
nicity: black, white, Asian/Pacific Islander, and American
Indian/Alaska Native (10). The other codes Hispanic ethnicity
as a separate construct.
Similar to the Georgia registry (2), we used capture–
recapture methods to estimate underascertainment of cases.
Specifically, we developed log-linear models that estimated
the number of missing cases predicted by the overlap among
the 3 primary sources (community rheumatology and nephrol-
ogy clinics, community hospitals, and integrated health care
systems). We evaluated the results of all log-linear models pos-
sible for a 3-source capture–recapture analysis and then chose
the best-fitting model based on chi-square goodness-of-fit
criteria (11). Using the estimated number of undercounted
cases from the best-fitting model, we calculated the capture–
recapture revised incidence and prevalence estimates for the
ACR definition. P values less than 0.05 were considered
significant.
We compared differences between estimates by case
definition using the 95% CIs of the age-adjusted rates. Non-
overlapping 95% CIs were considered to be significantly
different.
RESULTS
Study population. As shown in Figure 1, among
15,210 potential SLE patients identified from primary
and secondary sources, 4,859 met the geographic and
temporal catchment area criteria (residency in San
Francisco County from 2007 through 2009). Abstraction
was completed for 4,832 patients because 27 patients did
not have any available medical records. Of the abstracted
patients, 1,257 satisfied the catchment criteria and had a
physician recorded diagnosis of SLE, possible SLE,
undifferentiated/unspecified CTD, or a related connec-
tive tissue disorder such as mixed CTD in their medical
record. Of these 1,257 cases, 121 incident and 796 preva-
lent cases met the ACR case definition while 137 incident
and 909 prevalent cases met the combined case defini-
tion. All cases were confirmed using primary data
sources, including those initially ascertained from state
hospital discharge data. Commercial laboratory queries
did not provide any additional cases.
Incidence rates according to the ACR case defi-
nition.
The overall crude and age-standardized inci-
dence rates were 5.1 (95% CI 4.3–6.1) and 4.6 (95% CI
3.8–5.5) per 100,000 person-years (Table 1). The 121
incident cases consisted of 112 women and 9 men. Race
for these cases was identified as black (n 5 27), white
(n 5 43), Asian/Pacific Islander (n 5 39), and American
Indian/Alaska native (n 5 1); no race was identified in
11 of them. Hispanic ethnicity was identified in 17
patients; 18 had no ethnicity identified. Among the
Asian/Pacific Islander subgroup, the predominant race

tion (see Patients and Methods for details) group. 95% CI 5 95% confidence interval.

 was Chinese (21 patients; 17 were identified as Chinese
only, with the remaining 4 including another Asian/
Pacific Islander racial category) followed by Japanese (3
patients; 2 were exclusively Japanese), Filipino (2
patients; both of whom also had another Asian/Pacific
Islander racial category), and 1 each of Korean, Viet-
namese, Asian Indian, Samoan, and Hawaiian. The
remaining 7 cases were classified as “other Asian,” a
category that included Burmese, Indonesian, and Asian
not otherwise specified (data not shown).
The age-standardized incidence rates were about
12 times higher among women than men: 8.6 versus 0.7
per 100,000 person-years. The age-standardized inci-
dence rate was highest among black women (30.5 [95%
CI 20.7–44.9]), followed by Hispanic women (8.9 [95%
CI 5.3–14.8]), Asian women (7.2 [95% CI 5.1–10.2]),
and finally, white women (5.3 [95% CI 3.8–7.5]). The
age-standardized incidence rate among black women
was ;6 times higher than among white women.
Among black women, the age-specific incidence
rate peaked at 61.2 per 100,000 women in the 40–49-
year-old age group. Among the other racial/ethnic
groups, incidence rates were relatively constant across
the age groups (Figure 2). There were too few incident
cases in men (9 cases) to enable age stratification. The
overall mean age at diagnosis was 43.9 years. The mean
age at diagnosis stratified by bridged race/ethnicity was
40.1 years in blacks, 46.5 years in whites, 45.1 years in
Asians, and 36.6 years in Hispanics. All 95% CIs for the
race/ethnicity mean age estimates overlapped (data not
shown).
Our capture–recapture modeling estimated 33
(95% CI 8–130) additional incident cases in the popula-
tion. This yielded a capture–recapture inflated crude
rate of 6.5 per 100,000 person-years.
Incidence rates according to the combined case
definition.
The combined definition yielded an addi-
tional 16 cases (15 from the 3 ACR criteria plus rheu-
matologist diagnosis criterion and a single case from the
lupus-related kidney disease criterion) for a total of 137
incident cases (Table 1). The overall crude and age-
standardized incidence rates were 5.8 (95% CI 4.9–6.8)
and 5.2 (95% 4.3–6.2) per 100,000 person-years. Sex
and racial/ethnic disparities in the incident cases were
similar to those observed in the ACR cases.
Prevalence according to the ACR case definition.
The ACR definition yielded overall crude and age-
standardized prevalence proportions of 96.0 (95% CI
89.4–103.1) and 84.8 (95% CI 78.6–91.5) per 100,000
persons (Table 2). The 796 unique prevalent cases over
the 3-year period consisted of 708 women and 88 men.
We identified race for these cases as white (n 5 294),
Asian/Pacific Islander (n 5 290), black (n 5 160), and
American Indian/Alaskan native (n 5 4); race was not
identified in 48 patients. Hispanic ethnicity was identi-
fied for 118 patients. Similar to the incident cases, the
majority of the Asian/Pacific Islander subgroup was
composed of Chinese (137 patients; 101 were identified
as Chinese and no other race), followed by “other
Asian” (56 patients), Filipino (42 patients; 26 were not
identified with any other race), Vietnamese (18 patients;
12 had no other race identified), Japanese (10 patients;
8 were not identified with any other race), Korean (5
patients; 3 had no other race identified), Thai and Paki-
stani (4 patients each), Asian Indian and Samoan (3
patients each), other South Asian, Cambodian, and
Pacific Islander not otherwise specified (2 patients
each), and Hawaiian and Laotian (1 patient each) (data
not shown).
Age-standardized prevalence was about 8 times
higher among women than men: 155.6 versus 19.3 per
100,000 persons. The age-standardized prevalence was
highest among black women (458.1 [95% CI 385.4–
544.5]), followed by Hispanic women (177.9 [95% CI
145.9–217.0]), Asian women (149.7 [95% CI 131.4–
170.7]), and finally, white women (109.8 [95% CI 96.5–
124.9]). The age-standardized prevalence among black
women was over 4 times higher than that among white

was defined according to the American College of Rheumatology crite-
ria. The 95% confidence intervals for the incidence rates overlapped
within each age group, except for the groups ages 30–39 years and 40–49
years, where the rates for black women were statistically significantly
higher than those in the other racial groups or Hispanics. The race cate-
gories are mutually exclusive. Hispanic ethnicity was recorded separately
from race; therefore, persons of Hispanic ethnicity are also represented
in the race categories (mostly white).

 women. The age-standardized prevalence among black
men was over 5 times higher than among white men.
The age-specific prevalence in the ACR-defined
cases was statistically significantly higher in black
women compared with women of other racial groups for
ages 30–59 years, with whites and Asians for ages 69–79
years, and with whites only for ages 20–29 years. Among
black women, age-specific prevalence began to increase
at age 20 years and peaked at 954.5 per 100,000 in the
group ages 40–49 years (Figure 3). Among black men,
age-specific prevalence peaked in the 50–69 year range.
Age-specific prevalence was higher in black men as
compared to the other racial/ethnic groups (Figure 3).
Among men, 95% CIs overlapped within each age
group with the following exception: among those ages
50–59 years, the prevalence in black men was statisti-
cally significantly higher than in white men.
The overall mean age at diagnosis was 34.8 years.
Age at diagnosis stratified by bridged race and ethnicity
was as follows: 35.5 years in blacks, 34.4 years in whites,
34.6 years in Asians, and 33.9 years in Hispanics. Once
again, the 95% CIs for these estimates overlapped (data
not shown).
Our capture–recapture modeling estimated 147
(95% CI 93–225) additional prevalent cases in the
population. This yielded a capture–recapture inflated
average annual crude prevalence of 113.7 per 100,000
persons.
Prevalence according to the combined case defi-
nition.
By including an additional 113 individuals (89
based on the 3 ACR criteria plus rheumatologist diag-
nosis criterion and 24 based on the lupus-related kidney
disease criterion), the combined definition yielded a

SLE INCIDENCE AND PREVALENCE IN SAN FRANCISCO COUNTY, CALIFORNIA

 immunologic, (80%), arthritis (57%), renal disorder
(45%), pleuritis or pericarditis (41%), and malar rash
(33%) (Table 3). Neurologic disorder was the least com-
mon manifestation (8%). Renal disorder occurred more
commonly in the black (52%), Asian/Pacific Islander
(51%), and Hispanic (47%) patients than in the white
patients (40%). Discoid rash was highest among black
patients (22%) compared to the other groups and was
least common in the Asian (5%) and Hispanic (0%)
patients. Similar trends in the frequencies of clinical
manifestations across the racial and ethnic groups were
observed among the prevalent cases meeting the ACR
definition (data not shown).
DISCUSSION
The California Lupus Surveillance Project had
the opportunity to extend previous CDC-funded epide-
miologic work to include 2 additional racial/ethnic
groups and to confirm striking racial and ethnic dis-
parities in the incidence and prevalence of SLE. San
Francisco County is diverse, with substantial numbers of
Asian and Hispanic patients. We found that, in addition
to African Americans, Asian/Pacific Islanders and His-
panics (of any race) have been disproportionately
affected by SLE as compared to whites (regardless of
Hispanic ethnicity). Of the Hispanic cases included in
the analyses, the majority were identified as white or
had no race identified, e.g., race categories for the ACR
definition of prevalent cases of Hispanic ethnicity were
white (69%), no race identified (25%), Asian/Pacific
Islander (5%), and black (1%).
Hispanics currently comprise 16% and Asians
5% of the US population. By 2050, these numbers are
expected to rise to 30% and 8%, respectively (12). Thus,
a reliable estimate of the burden of SLE in these grow-
ing populations is essential for health care planning. A
major challenge to advancing knowledge in this area has
been the paucity of large-scale, population-based sur-
veillance studies with rigorously defined case definitions
and case-finding procedures. Up until the recent com-
pletion of the Georgia and Michigan surveillance proj-
ects, most previous epidemiologic studies were limited
by small geographic areas, homogenous populations,
varying case definitions, and incomplete case ascertain-
ment that relied on administrative codes or patient self-
reported diagnosis. Such historical studies provided
estimates ranging from 2.0 to 7.6 per 100,000 for the
overall incidence and from 19 to 241 per 100,000 for
the overall prevalence (13,14). The methods used in
the CDC-funded registries, including the CLSP, have
enabled us to determine more accurate and contempo-
rary estimates of the incidence and prevalence of SLE
in the US.
This study has several limitations. The first is the
potential for incomplete case ascertainment. Although
we used the HIPAA exemption for obtaining informed
consent, each clinic and hospital had to voluntarily
agree to participate in the CLSP. This issue led to the
potential for incomplete case ascertainment. For exam-
ple, 2 small community hospitals in San Francisco chose
not to participate in the CLSP. Based on the proportion
of discharges from these 2 hospitals to the total number
Figure 3. Average annual age-specific prevalence of systemic lupus
erythematosus (SLE) among women and men living in San Francisco
County, California, 2007–2009, categorized by race and Hispanic eth-
nicity. SLE was defined according to the American College of Rheu-
matology criteria. Among men, the 95% confidence intervals for
prevalence overlapped within each age group, except for the group
ages 50–59 years, where the prevalence in black men was statistically
significantly higher than that in white men. The race categories are
mutually exclusive. Hispanic ethnicity was recorded separately from
race; therefore, persons of Hispanic ethnicity are also represented in
the race categories (mostly white).
2002
DALL’ERA ET AL
 of discharges for San Francisco residents in 2007–2009
(16%) and the number of cases identified solely by
community-based hospitals (9), we estimate that the lack
of participation of these 2 hospitals resulted in potentially
only 2 missed prevalent cases according to the ACR defi-
nition. Incomplete case ascertainment might also have
occurred because we did not conduct field work in pri-
mary care clinics. Thus, it is possible that there were diag-
nosed cases of SLE in the community that never reached
the attention of a specialist or had not been seen by a
specialist for many years. Although capture–recapture
analysis estimated an additional 33 incident cases and
147 prevalent cases, these estimates are imprecise, as
indicated by the wide 95% CIs.
A second limitation is that data were collected
from a review of the medical records rather than from
direct patient interview and evaluation. The quality of
medical record documentation of SLE manifestations
varied widely. For longstanding, prevalent cases, it was
sometimes
difficult
to
retrieve
the
initial
medical
records that may have documented early manifestations
of disease. Third, race and ethnicity were determined
from the medical record and were not always well docu-
mented. This led to missing data for race and ethnicity
as well as the potential for misclassification. Last, our
denominator data were extracted from the US Census
files, which provide population totals at the Federal
Information Processing Standards level separately for
race and ethnicity. Therefore, it was not possible for us
to estimate the prevalence and incidence for mutually
exclusive combined categories of these variables (e.g.,
non-Hispanic white).
One of the major strengths of the CLSP was the
ability to conduct widespread case ascertainment by
using a variety of sources, including university and com-
munity clinics, hospitals, regional laboratories, and state
administrative databases. The abstractors comprehen-
sively reviewed the patients’ medical records, thereby
minimizing underreporting bias in case ascertainment.
The CDC funded this project with the specific intention
of developing credible and complete estimates of the
incidence and prevalence of lupus in Asians and His-
panics. Asians and Hispanics are generally smaller pop-
ulations that we thought might access health care
through alternative routes. To identify these patients,
case-finding efforts were refined by working with physi-
cians who were focused on those populations. For exam-
ple, we partnered with a physician who cares for many
of the Chinese patients in San Francisco at the Chinese
Hospital. To access the Hispanic population in San
Francisco, we performed extensive case-finding at San
Francisco General Hospital and the associated commu-
nity health network clinics. Our approach of partnering
with the community and engaging culturally and linguis-
tically concordant community members led to successful
case ascertainment of these traditionally understudied
populations. Had we not taken these extra steps, we
would have missed SLE cases in the Asian and Hispanic
populations.
SLE is a complex and heterogeneous disease for
which there is no gold standard diagnostic test (15).
One of the challenges of large epidemiologic studies is
the need to designate a diagnosis of SLE based on docu-
mentation in the medical record without the benefit of

 evaluating the patient in the clinical setting. For the
purposes of the CLSP, we used case definitions identical
to those utilized by other CDC-funded surveillance reg-
istries. In this way, consistent methodology across the
registries was achieved. The primary case-finding defini-
tion used for the study was meeting $4 of the 11 revised
classification criteria for SLE as defined by the ACR.
Because case ascertainment relied on patients’ medical
records and sometimes not all medical records for a
given patient were available, there was a potential for
underdiagnosis of SLE if we had relied only on the
ACR criteria definition. Therefore, we also used the
combined case definition that was used by the Georgia
Lupus Registry.
The CLSP found high age-standardized mean
annual incidence rates and prevalence proportions of
4.6 and 84.8 per 100,000, respectively, for the ACR defi-
nition and 5.2 and 96.8 per 100,000, respectively, for the
combined definition. The data confirmed and quantified
a higher burden of SLE in women and in racial and eth-
nic minorities. Using the ACR definition, the age-
standardized female-to-male incidence ratio was 12:1,
with
an
8:1
prevalence
ratio.
The
highest
age-
standardized mean annual incidence rates and preva-
lence proportions per 100,000 were found in black
women (30.5 and 458.1, respectively), followed by His-
panic women (8.9 and 177.9, respectively), Asian women
(7.2 and 149.7, respectively), and white women (5.3 and
109.8, respectively). Age-specific incidence rates and
prevalence proportions were highest in black women,
with peak incidence and prevalence in the group ages
40–59 years. The findings confirm previous studies that
showed an increased burden of SLE among black
women. For example, a population-based study in Alle-
gheny County, PA, determined a 3-fold higher incidence
rate among black women compared to white women
during the years 1985–1990 (16). The Georgia and
Michigan registries also showed higher incidence and
prevalence estimates among black women (2,3).
Interestingly, while the age-standardized inci-
dence rate per 100,000 according to the ACR definition
in CLSP was slightly lower (4.6) than those in the Geor-
gia (5.6) and Michigan (5.5) registries, the CLSP age-
standardized prevalence per 100,000 (84.8) was statisti-
cally significantly higher than that in either the Georgia
(73.0) or Michigan (72.8) registries. While the reasons
for the higher prevalence but lower incidence of SLE in
CLSP are not clear, factors such as better access to
health care and awareness of the disease in San Fran-
cisco compared to the locations of the other registries
may be playing a role. Also, among black women, the
age-standardized annual incidence rate and average
annual prevalence per 100,000 (30.5 and 458.1) were .2
times
higher
in
California
compared
to
Georgia
(13.4 and 196.2, respectively) and Michigan (12.8 and
186.3, respectively). Among white women, the age-
standardized mean annual incidence rates were more
similar among the 3 registries, although prevalence was
still statistically significantly higher in the CLSP.
The reasons for the higher incidence and preva-
lence for black women in the CLSP compared with the
other registries are not known, but may relate to several
factors. With regard to the observed increased inci-
dence, it is possible that the genetic ancestry of the black
population in San Francisco is different from that in
Georgia and Michigan, portending greater risk of dis-
ease. In addition, there may be environmental influ-
ences that increase the risk of SLE. Future studies will
be required to address these important questions and
further examine these possibilities.
There is a paucity of population-based studies
estimating the incidence and prevalence of SLE among
Hispanics and Asians in the US. Increased SLE disease
activity and organ damage among US Hispanics versus
non-Hispanic Caucasians have been previously noted by
studies conducted within the LUpus in MInorities,
NAture versus nurture (LUMINA) longitudinal cohort.
LUMINA studies have also showed differing disease
outcomes among various Hispanic subgroups, with
worse outcomes occurring among Hispanics in Texas
compared to Hispanics in Puerto Rico (17–19). Because
of reliance on medical record documentation of ethnic-
ity in CLSP, we were unable to differentiate various His-
panic
subgroups
in
the
incidence
and
prevalence
estimates. Fewer studies have examined differences in
SLE frequency and severity in Asian patients. One
recent study from the Monash Lupus Clinic in Mel-
bourne, Australia, showed increased disease severity
and serologic activity among Asian patients compared
with white patients (20). Thus, the CLSP contributes to
an improved understanding of the burden of SLE
among Asians and highlights the need for further work
on disease phenotypes, outcomes, and drug responses
which are likely to differ among patients from different
racial and ethnic backgrounds.
In conclusion, the CLSP confirmed the increased
burden of SLE in black, Asian, and Hispanic women
compared to white women. Future studies will be neces-
sary to broaden our understanding of the underlying eti-
ologies for this disparity, including attempts to unravel
the contributions of genetic and biologic factors versus
social and environmental factors in order to improve
patient outcomes.
