ABSTRACT
OBJECTIVES
To report the distribution of intraocular pressure (IOP) 
by age and sex and the prevalence of glaucoma.
DESIGN
Community based cross sectional observational study.
SETTING
EPIC-Norfolk cohort in Norwich and the surrounding 
rural and urban areas.
PARTICIPANTS
8623 participants aged 48-92 recruited from the 
community who underwent ocular examination to 
identify glaucoma.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES
Prevalence and characteristics of glaucoma, 
distribution of IOP, and the sensitivity and specificity 
of IOP for case finding for glaucoma.
RESULTS
The mean IOP in 8401 participants was 16.3 mm 
Hg (95% confidence interval 16.2 mm Hg to 16.3 
mm Hg; SD 3.6 mm Hg). In 363 participants (4%), 
glaucoma was present in either eye; 314 (87%) had 
primary open angle glaucoma. In the remaining 
participants, glaucoma was suspected in 607 
(7%), and 863 (10.0%) had ocular hypertension. 
Two thirds (242) of those with glaucoma had 
previously already received the diagnosis. In 76% 
of patients with newly diagnosed primary open 
angle glaucoma (83/107), the mean IOP was under 
the threshold for ocular hypertension (21 mm 
Hg). No one IOP threshold provided adequately 
high sensitivity and specificity for diagnosis of 
glaucoma.
CONCLUSIONS
In this British community, cases of glaucoma, 
suspected glaucoma, and ocular hypertension 
represent a large number of potential referrals to the 
hospital eye service. The use of IOP for detection of 
those with glaucoma is inaccurate and probably not 
viable.
Introduction
Glaucoma is the leading cause of irreversible 
blindness in the world1 and the second most common 
cause of registered blindness in England and Wales.2 
It comprises a group of ocular diseases of progressive 
damage to the optic nerve, with characteristic 
structural changes to the optic disc and visual 
field defects.3 Glaucoma and suspected glaucoma 
combined account for the sixth largest share of 
National Health Service (NHS) outpatient attendances 
in England, after general medical examination, breast 
cancer, schizophrenia, prostate cancer, and joint 
pain.4 The most common type of glaucoma among 
white people is primary open angle glaucoma (POAG); 
primary angle closure glaucoma (PACG), which results 
from occlusion of aqueous humour outflow, is more 
common among Asian people.5 Secondary glaucoma 
results from a diverse range of ocular and systemic 
conditions. Raised intraocular pressure (IOP) is the 
major modifiable risk factor for primary open angle 
glaucoma,6-8 but around half of people with glaucoma 
present with IOP below 21 mm Hg, which is the 
threshold for ocular hypertension (raised IOP without 
any evidence of glaucoma).9 The EPIC-Norfolk Eye 
Study, initiated in 2004, is the most recent large scale 
eye survey in the UK. We examined the prevalence and 
characteristics of glaucoma and distribution of IOP in 
the study participants.
Methods
The European Prospective Investigation of Cancer 
(EPIC) study is a pan-European multi-cohort study 
designed to investigate the lifestyle determinants of 
risk of cancer. The EPIC-Norfolk cohort was established 
in the city of Norwich and the surrounding rural and 
urban areas, in the eastern English county of Norfolk, 
in 1993-97.10 A total of 30 445 men and women aged 
40-79 were recruited at a baseline survey from the 
databases of 35 general practices. The predominant 
ethnicity of the cohort was white, and it included 
individuals across the range of socioeconomic status 
and educational achievements. The EPIC-Norfolk Eye 
study was carried out in 2004-11, when ophthalmic 
data were collected from 8623 participants.11

The first 443 sequential participants had IOP 
measured with a non-contact tonometer (AT555, 
Reichert Corporation, Philadelphia, PA, USA). In 
the remaining participants IOP was measured three 
times in each eye with the ocular response analyser 
(ORA) non-contact analyser (Reichert Corporation, 
Philadelphia, PA, USA) with software version 3.01. 
This flattens the cornea with a jet of air and uses an 
electro-optical system to measure the air pressures at 
which the cornea flattens both inwards and outwards. 
The average of the two pressure values are calibrated 
linearly against the Goldmann applanation tonometer 
(GAT) 
to 
provide 
a 
Goldmann-equivalent 
IOP 
measurement (IOPg, mm Hg).12
A systematic review showed that among 12 studies 
that directly compared the agreement between IOPg 
and GAT, the mean difference between the two (IOPg−
GAT) is 1.5 mm Hg (95% predicted interval −0.6 mm 
Hg to 3.7 mm Hg).13
The glaucoma status of the participants was 
determined from a systematic examination that 
included visual acuity, tonometry, and assessment of 
the optic nerve head (Heidelberg Retina Tomograph II) 
and the peripapillary nerve fibre layer with scanning 
laser polarimetry (GDx VCC, Zeiss, Dublin, CA, USA). 
A 24-2 central threshold visual field test (Humphrey 
750i Visual Field Analyzer, Carl Zeiss Meditech, 
Welwyn Garden City, UK) was performed in those 
participants with abnormal findings on HRT or GDx 
VCC and in one in 10 with normal findings. Those 
with abnormal findings who met a set of predefined 
criteria designed to detect glaucoma were referred 
to the eye department of the Norfolk and Norwich 
University Hospital for a definitive eye examination by 
a consultant ophthalmologist with a specialist interest 
in glaucoma (DCB). A detailed description of the study 
design has been published previously.11 Glaucoma 
was defined as the presence of characteristic structural 
abnormalities of the optic disc and visual field loss, 
with no other explanations for the disc and field 
appearances. The differentiation between high tension 
and normal tension glaucoma was based on IOP 
level before glaucoma treatment started. Suspected 
glaucoma was defined as the presence of early or 
minor glaucomatous disc features, associated with a 
normal visual field or the absence of visual field data. 
Ocular hypertension was defined as IOP >21 mm Hg 
with no features of glaucoma in the optic disc or visual 
field. Specific quantitative methods and principles 
for diagnosis of primary open angle glaucoma and 
suspected primary open angle glaucoma followed the 
diagnostic principles from the International Society 
of Geographical and Epidemiological Ophthalmology 
(ISGEO).3 To limit false positive or false negative 
results, another consultant glaucoma ophthalmologist 
(PJF) reviewed all examination findings and history in a 
subset of high risk participants. Figure 1 shows the flow 
of participants through the study and the diagnostic 
process. We determined glaucoma diagnosis per 
person by taking the clinically more serious diagnosis 
of either eye in the following hierarchy (most serious to 
least serious): glaucoma, suspected glaucoma, ocular 
hypertension (IOP >21 mm Hg), narrow angle spectrum 
(primary angle closure, primary angle closure suspect 
and narrow angles), and normal.
Statistical analysis
The IOP reported for the cohort was the mean of the 
mean IOP in the left and right eyes, with the ORA IOPg 
or the AT555 NCT values. We calculated sensitivities 
and specificities of IOP for glaucoma detection from 
the ability of various IOP thresholds to differentiate 
between participants with all cause glaucoma in 
either eye and those with no glaucoma in either eye. 
The reporting of this study conformed to the STROBE 
statement.14 All statistical analyses were performed 
with STATA (Stata/SE 13.1, StataCorp, College 
Station, TX).
Results
There were 8623 participants in the EPIC-Norfolk Eye 
Study, with a mean age of 68.7 (range 48-92), and over 
half (55%) were women. Compared with the population 
estimates for Norfolk and for the UK, the study 
population was older and had a decreasing proportion 
of women with age, which is opposite to the Norfolk

and UK population’s trend of an increasing proportion 
of women with age (fig 2). Nearly all participants were 
white (99.4%), compared with 96.5% and 87.2%, 
respectively, in Norfolk and the UK.15
Tables 1 and 2 show the glaucoma diagnosis 
by eye and by person. A total of 363 participants 
(4.2%, 95% confidence interval 3.8% to 4.6%) 
had glaucoma in either eye, 314 had primary open 
angle glaucoma (3.6%, 3.3% to 4.0%), 607 (7.0%) 
had suspected glaucoma, 863 (10.0%) had ocular 
hypertension (untreated IOP >21 mm Hg), and 54 
(0.6%) had narrow angle spectrum. Twenty three 
participants (0.3%) had no recorded diagnosis as 
they declined or were unable to undergo definitive 
eye examination after abnormal results on the 
screening tests. Table 3 breaks down glaucoma 
by type in the 363 affected men and women. Most 
people with glaucoma had primary open angle 
glaucoma (86.5%), with an equal proportion of high 
pressure and normal pressure glaucoma. Out of the 
523 eyes affected by glaucoma, formal visual field 
assessment was not feasible in 28 because of poor 
vision. Most of these participants had secondary 
glaucoma, which was diagnosed by advanced disc 
cupping and uncontrolled IOP.
Among the cases of glaucoma, 242 (66.6%) were 
previously known, and 66.3% cases of primary 
open angle glaucoma were previously known. The 
prevalence of glaucoma in the study population 
increased with age and was higher in men than in 
women (table 4).

IOP was measured in 8401 participants (7958 with 
ORA, 443 with AT555 NCT), 243 of whom used ocular 
hypotensive eye drops in either eye. Figure 3 shows the 
distribution of mean IOP of both eyes, which followed an 
approximately Gaussian distribution, with a right skew 
and an exaggerated peak. The cohort mean IOP was 16.3 
mm Hg (95% confidence interval 16.2 mm Hg to 16.3 
mm Hg; SD 3.6 mm Hg). Table 5 shows the distribution 
of IOP by age and sex. The mean IOP for glaucomatous 
eyes was 16.7 mm Hg (17.1 mm Hg to 18.1 mm Hg; 
range 4.0-45.6 mm Hg), and the percentage of eyes with 
glaucoma increased with IOP (fig 4). Of the 107 patients 
with a new diagnosis of primary open angle glaucoma, 
76% (81) had mean IOP below 21 mm Hg.
Table 6 and figure 5 show the sensitivity and 
specificity of glaucoma detection at different IOP 
thresholds. Overall, sensitivity was poor at all levels 
shown, regardless of the additional refining parameters 
of age and sex, and there was no one single level that 
afforded both high sensitivity and specificity.
discussion
In this large population based study, we found that 
intraocular pressure was not a sensitive or specific 
indicator of glaucoma. This is the most current 
large scale population study reporting glaucoma 
epidemiology in the UK. We found many participants 
with suspected glaucoma or ocular hypertension, 
confirming a large potential referral burden to the NHS. 
IOP has also been shown to be a poor case finding test 
for glaucoma. 
Principal findings and comparison with other 
studies
Data on prevalence of glaucoma have been reported 
from populations in the US,16 17 Australia,18 19 
Europe,20-22 and South East Asia.23-26 Recent data from 
the UK, however, is lacking, with the last published 
cross sectional population surveys being one from 
rural west of Ireland in 199327 and another from north 
London in 1998.28
There were differences between the participants 
from EPIC-Norfolk and the local population of 
Norfolk as the study participants were not sampled 
systematically but recruited by inviting all adults 
aged >40 from GP practices. Apart from differences in 
age and sex composition, EPIC-Norfolk participants 
were less likely to live in deprived areas and were 
potentially healthier because of the volunteer nature 
of the study. The people with glaucoma identified in 
the cohort might therefore not be fully representative 
of the local or national population and are probably 
an underestimation of the true numbers. Nevertheless, 
results in this study corroborated many established 
trends in glaucoma epidemiology. The predominant 
type in our cohort was primary open angle glaucoma, 
a consistent finding among European populations.529 
The prevalence increased with age, which is its 
strongest known risk factor.30 The prevalence of all 
cause glaucoma in those aged 48-92 was 4.2% (95% 
confidence interval 3.8% to 4.6%) and 3.7% (3.3% to 
4.0%) for primary open angle glaucoma. This echoed 
findings from a meta-analysis in 2014, in which the 
prevalence of glaucoma (primary open angle glaucoma 
and primary angle closure glaucoma) for Europeans

aged 40-80 was 2.93% (1.85% to 4.40%) and the 
prevalence of primary open angle glaucoma was 
2.51% (1.54% to 3.89%).5 In another meta-analysis, 
published in 2006, the pooled prevalence of primary 
open angle glaucoma in white people was 2.1% (1.6% 
to 2.7%).31
In our cohort, two thirds of those with primary open 
angle glaucoma had previously received the diagnosis. 
This is the highest reported figure from a major 
community based study. Previous reported figures 
include 49% in the Blue Mountains Eye Study,18 
50% in Melbourne’s Visual Impairment Study,19 
50% in the Thessaloniki Eye Study,22 47% in the 
Rotterdam Eye Study,20 and 50% among white people 
in the Baltimore Eye Survey.32 Glaucoma is a largely 
asymptomatic disease, with insidious onset. In most 
industrialised countries, it is detected by opportunistic 
case finding and relies on people being examined by 
an eye care professional. In the UK, this would usually 
be a community optometrist. People with suspected 
glaucoma are then referred to ophthalmologists for 
definitive diagnosis and management. The higher rate 
of previously known glaucoma cases in EPIC-Norfolk 
than in other studies could reflect either better access 
to healthcare among the study participants because of 
recruitment bias or generally more effective provision 
of healthcare in the UK, with universal access and free 
eye tests for those aged over 60 in the NHS.
A striking finding in the study was the large number 
of people with suspected glaucoma (7%) and ocular 
hypertension (10%). Collectively they represent a 
large number of potential referrals to the hospital eye 
services, many of whom remain under observation for 
up to five years.33 This is reflected by the existing burden 
in hospital eye services, whereby ocular hypertension 
accounts for 30-45% of the referrals it receives.34 35 
Coupled with the fact that glaucoma is a chronic 
disease that needs regular and long term follow-up, it 
is no wonder that glaucoma and suspected glaucoma 
account for the sixth largest share of NHS outpatient 
attendances.4
While raised IOP is the strongest risk factor after age 
for primary open angle glaucoma,30 our data reiterate 
that no single IOP level provides sufficiently high 
sensitivity and specificity for detection of glaucoma, as 
shown in figure 3, mirroring results from the Baltimore 
Eye Survey.16 This reinforces the principle that IOP 
alone without optic disc examination or a visual field 
test is not an effective screening tool for glaucoma.
Limitations of study 
There were several sources of under-reporting of a 
diagnosis of glaucoma in this study. Only 18% of 
participants underwent visual field testing. A meta-
analysis showed that lack of routine field testing in a 
population study was a study design factor that led to 
underdiagnosis.36 In our study, however, both disc and 
field abnormalities were prerequisites of diagnosis, 
supporting well established diagnostic principles used 
in most population cross sectional studies.17 20 23 32 37 38 
We used a multimodal optic disc examination to 
uncover glaucomatous damage and determine who 
was referred for a definitive exam. We therefore expect 
that few cases of glaucoma would have been missed. 
The number of cases of narrow angle spectrum is also 
likely to be underestimated, as gonioscopy or anterior 
chamber depth assessment on slit lamp were not part 
of the screening test, although those with primary 
open angle glaucoma should not have been missed 
because of that as all glaucoma suspects underwent a 
full examination.
Conclusion
In conclusion, this study confirms the high prevalence 
of glaucoma and suspected glaucoma in the UK.

We have reported the IOP distribution among 
the population and among those with glaucoma, 
confirming its poor case finding performance. These 
findings will be useful in the planning of ophthalmic 
services in the UK and help to revaluate the use of IOP 
in making referrals from the community to the hospital 
eye services. 
We thank Haogang Zhu for his help in extracting visual field data, Pak 
Sang Lee for his technical assistance with the EPIC-Norfolk Eye Study, 
and Ananth Viswanathan FRCOphth for providing one of the visual 
field analysers used in this study.
