While changes in gut microbial populations have been described in human immuno-deficiency virus (HIV)-infect-
ed patients undergoing antiretroviral therapy (ART), the mechanisms underlying the contributions of gut bacteria
and their molecular agents (metabolites and proteins) to immune recovery remain unexplored. To study this, we
examined the active fraction of the gut microbiome, through examining protein synthesis and accumulation of me-
tabolites inside gut bacteria and in the bloodstream, in 8 healthy controls and 29 HIV-infected individuals (6 being
longitudinally studied). We found that HIV infection is associated to dramatic changes in the active set of gut bac-
teria simultaneously altering the metabolic outcomes. Effects were accentuated among immunological ART re-
sponders, regardless diet, subject characteristics, clinical variables other than immune recovery, the duration
and type of ART and sexual preferences. The effect was found at quantitative levels of several molecular agents
and active bacteria which were herein identified and whose abundance correlated with HIV immune path-
ogenesis markers. Although, we cannot rule out the possibility that some changes are partially a random
consequence of the disease status, our data suggest that most likely reduced inflammation and immune re-
covery is a joint solution orchestrated by both the active fraction of the gut microbiota and the host.

1. Introduction
Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a chronic inflammatory
disease, in which numerous structural (enterocyte apoptosis and the
loss of epithelial integrity), functional (errors in the production of
mucin/IgA), and immunological (loss of sub-mucosal lymphocytes) de-
fects contribute to an excess risk of mortality (Buzón et al., 2010; Mutlu
et al., 2014; McGrath et al., 2015). It has recently been shown that HIV
infection also induces a compositional shift in the gut microbiota, with
enrichment for bacterial populations, genes and functional capabilities
that are either pro-inflammatory or potentially pathogenic, and whose
abundance correlated with immune status (McHardy et al., 2013;
Vujkovic-Cvijin et al., 2013; Mutlu et al., 2014; Vázquez-Castellanos
et al., 2015). However, imbalances in gut bacteria have been found to
be different in patients undergoing highly active antiretroviral therapy
(ART) compared to untreated patients (Vázquez-Castellanos et al.,
2015). This raises the question of whether the gut ecosystem contrib-
utes to chronic inflammation and disease progression (Vujkovic-Cvijin
et al., 2013; Vázquez-Castellanos et al., 2015) but also to immune recov-
ery, although these patients are still characterized by residual inflam-
mation and excess mortality (Vujkovic-Cvijin et al., 2013; Somsouk
et al., 2014; Vázquez-Castellanos et al., 2015).

 Here, we determine whether gut microbiota contribute to inflam-
mation and immune recovery in HIV-infected individuals, and, if they
do, which molecular agents are implicated. The present investigation
demonstrates an association between an optimal immunovirological
ART response and the active fraction of the gut microbiome, as gut bac-
teria in immunological responders were found to be metabolically dis-
tinct from those in viremic untreated and immunological-non
responders. We showed that this occurs both at the level of microbes´
protein synthesis and microbes´ metabolic activity. It is plausible that
immune recovery might induce alterations in metabolic profiles in the
gut environment. However, our findings provide also evidences sug-
gesting the contribution of gut bacteria to ART-mediated immune re-
covery. Changes in the gut ecosystem in HIV-infected patients
undergoing ART may thus be both a consequence and a potential
cause of the recovery of mucosal and systemic immunity. Here, we pro-
vide an explanation of the causes that contribute to this association,
such as that active gut bacteria are involved in controlling mucosal epi-
thelial integrity and the accumulation of pro-inflammatory mediators
and molecules that reduce viral infection and increase immune recov-
ery. This was demonstrated by their association with adaptive immune
and inflammatory markers involved in HIV immune-pathogenesis.
Furthermore, plasma metabolome analyses demonstrated that human
cells respond reciprocally by increasing the biosynthesis of anti-
inflammatory and pro-solving lipid mediators that circulate in the blood-
stream. Altogether, it is plausible that immune system-bacteria synergism
mediates solutions to inflammation and promotes immune recovery.
2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Study Design, Participants, Setting and Eligibility
We recruited HIV-infected individuals, including 9 ART-naïve un-
treated (VU) individuals, 12 immunological ART responders (IR), 8 im-
munological ART non-responders (INR) (IR and INR, ≥350 and b350
CD4+ T-cell counts/μL after N2 years of viral suppression, respectively),
and 8 unmatched HIV-uninfected (HIV−) individuals. HIV-infected indi-
viduals on ART were representative of a middle-aged long-term treated
population without metabolic abnormalities (Table 1). Subjects were
recruited from the HIV clinics of two University hospitals in Madrid,
Spain (University Hospital Clínico San Carlos and University Hospital
Ramón y Cajal). The inclusion criteria were serologically documented
HIV infection and an age of 18 years old or older. Controls (HIV−)
were healthy HIV-uninfected volunteers (most of them were staff
working at either institution) that were recruited with the aim of
obtaining a group of similar age. We additionally included longitudinal
samples for 6 individuals to assess intra-individual variation (VU: 1;
IR: 3; HIV−: 2). The following exclusion criteria were used: concomitant
medications, the use of systemic antibiotics during the previous
3 months, and any acute or chronic condition other than chronic HIV in-
fection, including gastrointestinal symptoms (constipation, bloating or
diarrhoea) or co-infections by hepatitis B or C viruses. This study
conformed to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and Good
Clinical Practice Guidelines and was approved by the Independent
Ethics Committees of both recruiting institutions (approval number
11/284). Table 1 summarizes the characteristics of the individuals,
which are detailed in Table S1 in the online version at http://dx.doi.
org/10.1016/j.ebiom.2016.04.033.. Table S2 shows the type of ART regi-
men in each group.
2.2. Metabolite Measurements in Gut Bacteria and Plasma Samples
Fresh stool samples were collected from each subject, frozen imme-
diately and stored until processing at −80 °C. After thawing, the gut
bacteria were separated from faecal material, and the metabolites that
had accumulated intracellularly were extracted from equal amounts of
microbial cells per sample by adapting a previously reported method
(Rojo et al., 2015a,b) in which a two-step extraction method produces
the optimal extraction efficiency for both polar and hydrophobic metab-
olites. Briefly, microbial cells were separated from the faecal matrix by
mixing 0.4 g of faecal sample with 1.2 mL of phosphate-buffered saline
(PBS) (1:3 w/v faeces to PBS ratio). Following re-suspension (by 1 min
of vigorous vortexing), the samples were then centrifuged at 1,000 g
at 4 °C for 1 min to remove faecal debris. The supernatant (1.2 mL)
was transferred to a 2-mL Eppendorf tube and centrifuged at 13,000 g
at 4 °C for 5 min to pellet the cells. This protocol was repeated 3 times.
The cell counts in the bacterial pellets were then immediately analysed,
as previously described (Bargiela et al., 2015), so that the same amount
of bacterial cells was used in each extraction experiment. A total of 108
gut bacterial cells per sample were used for methanol extractions, in
which 1.2 mL of cold (−80 °C) high performance liquid chromatogra-
phy (HPLC)-grade methanol was added. The samples were then
vortex-mixed (for 10 s) and sonicated for 30 s (in a Sonicator® 3000;
Misonix) at 15 W in an ice cooler (−20 °C). This protocol was repeated
twice with a 5-min storage period at −20 °C between each cycle, and
the final pellet was removed following centrifugation at 12,000 g for
10 min at 4 °C. Immediately after the methanol extracts were obtained,
the methanol solution was stored at −80 °C, and the remaining cell pel-
let was re-suspended in 1.2 mL of cold (4 °C) HPLC-grade H2O and sub-
jected to 3 cycles of sonication for 20 s (in a Sonicator® 3000; Misonix)
at 15 W in ice water. The samples were incubated on ice for 2 min

 between cycles. The final pellet was removed following centrifugation
at 12,000 g for 10 min at 4 °C. Immediately after the H2O and methanol
extracts were obtained, a mixture was prepared by combining equal
amounts (1 mL) of each of the extracts. Once prepared, the final solution
was stored in 20-mL penicillin vials at −80 °C until they were analysed.
Prior to analysis, a pre-processing step was performed to eliminate im-
purities and particles by mixing the samples with (HPLC)-grade aceto-
nitrile (1:1) and subsequently centrifuging them (13,000 g at 4 °C,
10 min). Then, the supernatant was divided into two aliquots one of
them immediately analysed by liquid chromatography electrospray
ionization quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-
QTOF-MS) and the other evaporated and reconstituted in an equal vol-
ume of MilliQ water containing an internal standard (0.2 mM L-
methionine sulfone) and 0.1 M formic acid and subsequently analysed
by capillary electrophoresis time-of-flight mass spectrometry (CE-
TOF-MS).
Plasma samples were also collected from each subject from fasting
venous blood. Samples were centrifuged and stored at −80 °C until
use. After thawing, the plasma was subjected to a pre-processing step
to eliminate impurities and particles by mixing it with (HPLC)-grade
acetonitrile (1:1) followed by centrifugation (13,000 g at 4 °C,
10 min), and analysed immediately by LC-ESI-QTOF-MS.
Bacterial and plasma samples were metabolome-typed using a com-
bination of untargeted mass spectrometry and two different and com-
plementary
separation
techniques:
LC-ESI-QTOF-MS
(LC:
1290
infinity, Agilent, QTOF-MS: Agilent 6550 iFunnel) in positive and nega-
tive mode and CE-TOF-MS (CE: 7100 Agilent, TOF-MS 6224 Agilent) in
positive mode. The full details for chemical and reagents, methods,
and preparation of quality controls (QCs) are available in Rojo et al.
(2015a,b).
2.3. Metabolite Data Treatment, Statistical Analysis and Identification
For metabolomic data treatments, the Molecular Feature Extraction
tool in the Mass Hunter Qualitative Analysis software (B.06.00, Agilent)
was used. The alignment of the raw data (from bacteria and plasma
datasets) was performed using Mass Profiler Professional software (ver-
sion 13.0, Agilent). The variables were then filtered according to the fil-
tering criteria proposed by Godzien et al. (2015): variables that were
present in at least 50% of the samples of each group and i) present in
at least 80% of the QCs that obtained a coefficient of variation b30% or
ii) present in b20% of the QCs. Models were subsequently built using
SIMCA-P+ software (12.0.1.0, Umetrics). The full details for data treat-
ment and statistical analysis can be seen in Rojo et al. (2015a,b). Briefly,
after missing values replacement, Mann–Whitney U tests were used to
perform all of the comparisons, followed by Benjamini–Hochberg post
hoc correction (P b 0.05). The resulting list of accurate masses that sig-
nificantly differed between groups was searched using the CEU Mass
Mediator search tool (http://biolab.uspceu.com/mediator; error ±
5 Da) to obtain tentative identifications. This procedure was performed
independently for each analytical platform.
The identity of the compounds selected according to their signifi-
cance in the class separation was further confirmed using LC-MS/MS
in the same LC-ESI-QTOF-MS. Ions were targeted for collision-induced
dissociation (CID) fragmentation based on the previously determined
accurate masses and retention times. Their identities were confirmed
by comparing the fragments that were obtained with the structure of
the proposed compound in the MS/MS spectra in a public database
(METLIN: https://metlin.scripps.edu/metabolites_list.php) or against
commercially available standards.
2.4. Protein Extraction, Mass Spectrometry and Data Analysis
Protein extracts were isolated as previously described (Hernández
et al., 2013), with small modifications. Briefly, equal amounts of
enriched gut bacteria samples (108 cell in total per sample), obtained
as described above, were re-suspended in 1.2 mL of BugBuster® Protein
Extraction Reagent (Novagen, Darmstadt, Germany) for 30 min with
shaking (250 rpm). Then, the samples were disrupted by sonication
using a pin Sonicator® 3000 (Misonix, New Highway Farmingdale,
NY, USA) for a total time of 2 min (10 W) on ice (4 cycles × 0.5 min
with 1.0 min ice-cooling between each cycle). The extracts were then
centrifuged for 10 min at 12,000 g and 4 °C to separate cellular debris
and intact cells, and the supernatants were then carefully aspirated
(to avoid disturbing the pellet), transferred to new tubes, and stored
at −80 °C until use.
Protein extracts were thawed on ice, and 50 μg of each sample was
precipitated using 1 ml 20% trifluoroacetic acid at 4 °C for 40 min follow-
ed by 15 min of centrifugation at 12,500 g and 4 °C. Protein pellets were
washed twice in ice-cold acetone and dried using vacuum centrifuga-
tion at 30 °C. Prior to 1D-SDS-PAGE (12%, 60 min at 20 mA), pellets
were solubilized in 15 μL Laemmli-buffer by 5 min of sonication follow-
ed by vortexing. Samples were incubated for 8 min at 95 °C to reduce di-
sulphide bonds, and 12 μL of each sample was run on a gel. Proteins
were separated by b1 cm, cut, and subjected to in-gel trypsin digestion
overnight at 37 °C (Shevchenko et al., 2006). The obtained peptides
were purified and desalted using C18 StageTips (Rappsilber et al.,
2003, 2007), dried using vacuum centrifugation, and prior to LC-MS/
MS measurements, they were reconstituted in 20 μL 0.1% trifluoroacetic
acid/2% acetonitrile.
Each sample of 8 μL was injected using an autosampler and concen-
trated on a trapping column (Pepmap100, C18, 100 μm × 2 cm, 5 μm,
Thermo Fisher Scientific) with water containing 0.1% formic acid and
2% acetonitrile at flow rates of 4 μL min−1. After 10 min, the peptides
were
eluted
into
a
separation
column
(PepmapRSLC,
C18,
75 μm × 50 cm, 2 μm, Thermo Fisher Scientific). Chromatography was
performed using 0.1% formic acid in solvent A (100% water) and B
(100% acetonitrile). The solvent B gradient was set from 4 to 8% for
the first 15 min and subsequently increased to 20% for the next
110 min. After this, solvent B was increased from 20% to 30% over
15 min, from 30% to 40% over 10 min, and finally switched to 90% sol-
vent B for an additional 10 min using a nano-high pressure liquid chro-
matography system (Ultimate3000 UHPLC, Thermo Fisher Scientific).
Ionized peptides were measured and fragmented using a Q Exactive
mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). For an unbiased
analysis, continuous scanning of the eluted peptide ions was per-
formed between 400 and 1200 m/z and then automatically switched
to MS/MS higher energy collisional dissociation mode with twelve
MS/MS events per survey scan. For MS/MS higher energy collision
conditions (HCD) measurements, a dynamic precursor exclusion
of 30 s per peptide match and an apex trigger of 2 to 30 s were
enabled.
To achieve a more precise evaluation of protein abundances and to
decrease the false discovery rate of peptide identifications, a two-step
database search was used (Jagtap et al., 2013; Hansen et al., 2014).
Raw MS and MS/MS data were first processed using Thermo Proteome
Discoverer software (v.1.4.1.14) and Mascot Server (v. 2.4.1) and then
independently searched against the NCBInr databases (v. April 25,
2015) for bacteria. Oxidation of methionine was set as the variable mod-
ification, and carbamidomethylation of cysteine was set as the fixed
modification. Precursor ion tolerance was defined at 10 ppm, and frag-
ment ion tolerance was set to 0.02 Da. Furthermore, all peaks except
for the top 12 peaks per 100 Da in each MS/MS were removed to remove
noise from the spectra before identification. To extract a more specific
protein Fasta database, the default settings of Thermo Proteome Discov-
erer were kept, including protein grouping with a minimum peptide
confidence set to “medium” and a delta Cn of 0.15. A strict maximum
parsimony principle was used.
At the second step, the obtained in-house database was used for
label-free protein quantification by applying the Label Free Quantifica-
tion (LFQ) modality of the MaxQuant software (v. 1.5.3.8). Cysteine car-
bamidomethylation was set as the fixed modification, and methionine
205
S. Serrano-Villar et al. / EBioMedicine 8 (2016) 203–216
 oxidation was set as the variable modification. Re-quantification was
enabled. Two missed cleavage sites were allowed for protease digestion,
and peptides were required to be fully tryptic. Other parameters of the
software were kept at the default settings. These included a peptide
and protein False Discovery Rate (FDR) below 1%, at least 1 peptide
per protein, a precursor mass tolerance of 4.5 ppm and a fragment ion
mass tolerance of 20 ppm. The LFQ abundance values were subjected
to statistical analyses using Primer 6 software (v. 6.1.16). Principal coor-
dinate analysis (PCO) was calculated on the basis of the Bray–Curtis dis-
similarity matrix (Bray and Curtis, 1957). Significant differences between
treatment groups were determined by performing one-way Analysis of
Similarities (ANOSIM) and Similarity Percentages (SIMPER) analyses.
Phylogenetic analyses based on the identified peptides were per-
formed using Unipept (Mesuere et al., 2012, 2015).
2.5. Histone Acetylation
Thawed peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were analysed
by western blot using cell lysates (equal protein concentration) and an-
tibodies to acetylated (Ac) histone (H)3 as described previously (Elliott
et al., 2014).
2.6. Experimental Validations of Key Active Metabolites
The ability of Succinivibrio dextrinosolvens (type strain DSM-3072;
DSMZ,
Braunchweig,
Germany),
Pseudomonas
aeruginosa
PAO,
Escherichia coli K12, Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis to
transport and assimilate biliverdin (BV) and oleamide (Sigma Aldrich,
Madrid, Spain), was confirmed as follows. First, pure cultures (in tripli-
cates) of S. dextrinosolvens were setup in medium 330 (anaerobic, 37 °C,
2 weeks) in the presence of both metabolites at a final concentration of
10 mg/L. Cultures of the control strains were setup in Luria Bertani me-
dium as described previously (Kubacka et al., 2007). Control cultures
without the addition of BV and oleamide were set up. The extent of as-
similation in test and control samples was quantified as follows. Briefly,
bacterial cells (from 500 ml culture) were separated by centrifugation at
13,000 g at room temperature for 10 min. After supernatant separation,
bacterial pellet was used for methanol extraction and water extraction
as described above. Metabolite solutions were stored at −80 °C until
they were analysed by mass spectrometry as described above. The
abundance levels of mass signatures of BV and oleamide were deter-
mined in both supernatants and cells.
2.7. Biomarker Discovery
The linear discriminative analysis (LDA) effect size (LEfSe) algorithm
(Segata et al., 2011) was used to identify the species that were overrep-
resented in each of the four groups of the cohort. The p-value cut-off
was set to be below to 0.001 for the Kruskal–Wallis test and 0.01 for
each of the Wilcoxon test parwise comparisons between the groups.
The resulting species with significant differences between samples
were used to build the LDA model and to estimate its effect as a discrim-
inant feature among them. The threshold used to consider a discrimina-
tive feature for the logarithmic LDA score was set to N2.
2.8. Clinical Associations between the Active Microbiota and the Immune
Activation Markers
The association between the active microbiota and innate immune
activation and bacterial translocation markers was determined by
applying a generalized linear regression model, using glmnet package
(library “glment” function “cv.glmnet”) (Friedman et al., 2010). As re-
sponse variables, we took the log10 transformation of all the immune
activation markers measured for each of the participants of the cohort.
As predictors, we considered the active taxa abundance matrix, trans-
formed by the Arcsin square root normalization. The Least Absolute
Shrinkage and Selection Operator was used as the regression method
to penalize the absolute size of the regression coefficients. The perfor-
mance of each of the predictive model was validated by means of the
k-mean cross-validation using cv. glmnet function in the “glmnet” R
package. In order to increase the confidence of the predicted associa-
tions only those edges that possess a significative Spearman-
correlation p-value (b0.05) were included into the model. All the
models were represented as a network manner using the igparh pack-
age (library “igraph” function “graph.data.frame”). Markers were deter-
mined as described previously (Vázquez-Castellanos et al., 2015).
3. Results
3.1. Methodology and Study Population
A compositional survey of proteins and metabolites accumulated in-
side gut bacteria, previously separated from faecal samples, was used to
identify changes in microbes´ protein synthesis and microbes´ metabolic
activity, respectively. In parallel, metabolites accumulated in plasma
samples were used as estimation of alterations in human cell metabo-
lism and translocation of microbial products. To capture results for a
wide spectrum of HIV immune-pathogenesis, we recruited and investi-
gated viremic untreated HIV-infected individuals (VU; n = 9) and im-
munological antiretroviral therapy (ART) responders (IR; n = 12) and
non-responders (INR; n = 8) (IR and INR, ≥350 and b350 CD4+ T-
cell counts/μL after N2 years of viral suppression, respectively). The
comparator group was composed of healthy controls (HIV−; n = 8). A
full description of the methods is available in the Materials and Methods
section.

We first asked whether gut bacteria metabolism might be represen-
tative of the HIV immune-pathogenesis disease status. To prove this, gut
bacteria metabolomes were examined in three groups of HIV-infected
patients (VU, IR and INR) and a set of HIV-uninfected controls. A total
of 336,502 mass features associated to microbes' metabolic activity
were detected. After treatment of the data (Table S3 in the online ver-
sion at http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ebiom.2016.04.033.; P b 0.05), an un-
supervised scatter plot generated using Principal Component Analysis
(PCA) scores revealed differences between HIV subjects and controls
(Fig. 1a; Fig. S1), which is in agreement with previous evidences at the
level of community composition (Dillon et al., 2014; Mutlu et al.,
2014; Noguera-Julian et al., 2016). Further, we observed clusters in
which the VU and INR groups of patients were the most similar and
were more similar to the HIV-uninfected group. It also revealed a clear
separation of the IR group. The fact that INR patients, who received
ART, were clustered separately from IR individuals suggests that the ob-
served changes were not due to the ART treatment itself, but they were
instead due to a biological cause or the consequence of immune recov-
ery. We further analysed the possible confounding effect of other rele-
vant factors. Since a major immunological driver of impaired CD4+ T
cell recovery is late presentation (Girardi et al., 2007), as expected,
INR patients were at more advanced disease at diagnosis and showed
a statistically significant lower Nadir CD4+ T-cells (Table 1; P =
0.041). However, neither diet, subject characteristics such as age, gen-
der, race, and body mass index, clinical variables such as glucose, creat-
inine, triglyceride and cholesterol levels, and adaptive immune markers
such as CD4+ T-cells, Nadir CD4+ T-cells, CD4/CD8 ratio and %CD8+
HLA-DR + CD38+ T cells, nor the duration and the type of ART and sex-
ual preferences seem to have exerted a confounding effect in the results
(for details see Supplementary Results and Fig. S2).
These results demonstrate an association between adequate CD4+
T cell recovery (to N350 cells/mm3) in HIV-infected individuals treated
with ART and gut bacteria metabolism. However, the fact that HIV non-
206

 infected individuals with CD4+ T cell counts N350/mm3 displayed dif-
ferent metabolic profiles than ART responders who also had CD4+ T
cell counts N350/mm3 indicates that the CD4+ T cell level itself is not
a marker of the metabolic status of the gut ecosystem.
3.3. Bacterial Metabolomics
3.3.1. Comparisons of Metabolic Deficits: Influence of HIV, ART and Immune
Recovery
We explored the metabolic alterations (P b 0.05) associated to HIV
infection per se, ART use and immune recovery (Fig. S3). Among
336,502 mass features associated to bacterial activity detected, a total
of 2716 (or 0.8%) exclusively distinguished uninfected and HIV-
untreated groups, suggesting that the impact of HIV infection per se
on microbes' metabolic activity is moderately low. When comparing
HIV-untreated and ART treated groups, so that the impact of ART is eval-
uated, we found additional alterations in 974 (or 0.29%) mass features,
suggesting that the impact of ART per se on the gut microbiota
metabolite-wide flux distribution is also moderately low. These findings
may contradict with the major imbalances in the gut bacterial composi-
tion in HIV-infected patients compared to controls and patients under-
going highly active ART compared to untreated patients (McHardy et al.,
2013; Vujkovic-Cvijin et al., 2013; Mutlu et al., 2014; Vázquez-
Castellanos et al., 2015). However, it should be noticed that albeit our
gut microbiome is always changing, it's also remarkably stable, and
that the bacteria of the gut have evolved specialized core functions
that are maintained under different conditions (Moya and Ferrer,
2016). We finally explored the alterations associated to the immune re-
covery by comparing IR and INR groups, and found 1542 mass features
as biomarkers that exclusively associated with immunological ART re-
sponders (Fig. S3). This demonstrates that the immune recovery associ-
ated to major metabolic changes in the gut ecosystem as compared to
those caused by the HIV and ART itself: immune status is thus a stronger
factor driving metabolite fluxes in the gut ecosystem.
3.3.2. Potential Biomarker Metabolites Related to Inflammatory and Im-
mune Recovery
Fig. 1a suggests that major changes in microbes' metabolic activity
are associated to an optimal immunological response to ART. Although,
it is plausible this is a side effect consequence, it is also possible that the
microbial community and its molecular agents (i.e. metabolites) are
drastically changed to help immune recovery during antiretroviral
therapy. To test this, we selected potential biomarkers related to inflam-
matory and immune recovery. Statistically significant differences for the
innate immune activation markers CD4+ T-cells, nadir CD4+ T-cells,
CD4/CD8 ratio and %CD8+ HLA-DR + CD38+ T cells (Table S1 in the
online version at http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ebiom.2016.04.033.) be-
tween groups were tested by an independent t-test using them as con-
tinuous variables. To reduce noise in data analysis, pre-processing was
performed to include only discriminating metabolites between groups
(P b 0.05) whose empirical formulas and identities were assigned and
confirmed (Fig. S3; Table S3 in the online version at http://dx.doi.org/
10.1016/j.ebiom.2016.04.033.). A total of 1190 metabolites were select-
ed, from which 55 were potential candidates (Rho N 0.918; P b 0.05).
Among them, we found a positive correlation between %CD8+ HLA-
DR + CD38+ T cells and the level of a ceramide-related metabolite de-
tected in this study, C16 ceramide (Rho = 0.952). Lower levels of
%CD8+ HLA-DR + CD38+ T cells associated to healthy controls and

207

 also IR groups of individuals (P b 0.0239; Fig. 2). Note that intestinal tis-
sues contain higher levels of ceramides than do other tissues (Bouhours
and Bouhours, 1985) and that accumulation of ceramides by opportu-
nistic pathogens is an indication of their ability to scavenge lipids from
the host and destruction of tissues (Heung et al., 2006). Since, lower
CD8+ T cell activation was associated to lower levels of inflammation
it is plausible that the species responsible for the removal of lipids are
drastically decreased in immune responders.
We also found 10 metabolite markers of epithelial barrier integrity,
hepatic function, viral infectivity and inflammation that distinguish all
groups, that included: i) the sialic acid derivative N-acetylneuraminic
acid (Neu5Ac) and the dolichol derivatives dolichol phosphate (Dol-P)
and dolichyl-β-D-glucosyl phosphate (Dol-β-G) that are markers of
structural changes of the epithelial barrier (Schenk et al., 2001; Varki
and Schauer, 2009); ii) arachidonic acid (AA) and its pro-inflammatory
metabolic product leukotriene B4 (LTB4) and the cannabinoid N-acyl
amide oleamide, that are markers of inflammation and immune recovery
(Bell et al., 2000; Rao et al., 2011; Archin and Archin, 2014); and iii) the
haeme catabolic products biliverdin (BV), bilirubin (BR), and urobilogen
(URO), that are markers of the hepatic function, HIV viral infectivity
(Wegiel and Otterbein, 2012) and inflammation (Fowler, 2004).
As shown in Table S4, measurements of the levels of accumulated
Dol-P and Dol-β-G indicated that they were significantly accumulated
in the gut bacteria of all HIV-infected patients (VU, IR and INR) com-
pared to controls (P b 0.044), with no statistically significant differences
between VU, IR and INR subjects. Accumulation of Neu5Ac only oc-
curred in bacteria of VU patients (P b 0.00076). This suggests the
presence in HIV-infected patients of pathogens that are able to remove
integral components of the host membranes, the abundance of some of
which (i.e. those able to scavenge sialic acids) decreased in patients re-
ceiving ART.
Gut bacteria of all HIV-infected individuals accumulated AA, and no
statistically significant differences were found between the three
groups (VU, IR and INR); however, the level of AA in the gut microbiota
was below the detection limit in healthy individuals (P b 0.000023;
Table S4). This suggests the increased release of un-metabolized AA in
the gut environment of HIV-infected individuals and its consequential
accumulation by gut bacteria. The AA metabolic product LTB4 was
found to be accumulated only in the gut bacteria of IR patients
(P b 0.02291; Table S4). LTB4 is among the first soluble pro-
inflammatory factors that are produced by the innate immune system
from AA (Bertin et al., 2012). In vitro co-cultures of HIV-1-infected
monocytes have been shown to secrete high levels of LTB4, which sub-
stantially contribute to neuro-inflammation and neurotoxicity (Genis
et al., 1992). Additionally, elevated levels of LTB4 have been found in
the cerebrospinal fluids of patients with AIDS (Froldi et al., 1992). We
hypothesized that gut bacteria accumulate this important pro-
inflammatory mediator, which would otherwise be amassed in the gut
environment, where it would induce inflammation (Flamand et al.,
2004; Bertin et al., 2012). To test this hypothesis, we determined the
amount of LTB4 in total faecal fluids. We found that LTB4 is extensively
excreted into the gut environment at a high level in VU and INR individ-
uals, while it was found at up to 32-fold lower levels in the faecal fluids
of IR individuals and healthy controls (P b 0.05; Table S4). These mea-
surements indicate that the biosynthesis and further excretion into
the gut space of LTB4 increased as a consequence of HIV infection,
which is in agreement with previous studies (Froldi et al., 1992; Genis
et al., 1992). This process occurs whatever the patient is or is not treated
with antiretroviral drugs and regardless of the level of immune recov-
ery. Importantly, the accumulation of LTB4 in immunological re-
sponders occurs inside gut bacteria and not in faecal fluids, which
prompted us to suggest that gut bacteria play a role in controlling the
level of free LTB4 that is released into the gut environment. Consequent-
ly, bacteria might have evolved as yet unknown specific systems to
transport pro-inflammatory signals and to regulate their concentration
to assist in inflammation and, possibly, immune recovery. This was also
supported by showing that the cannabinoid N-acyl amide oleamide, a
molecule that regulates inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract
(Carroll et al., 1992), was also significantly accumulated by gut bacteria
present only in the IR group of patients and was below the detection
limit in the VU and INR patients and healthy controls (P b 0.00073;
Table S4).
BV, the first reaction product of the breakdown of haeme catabolism,
accumulated only in the gut bacteria of IR patients; BR, a degradation
product of BV, accumulated only in the bacteria of INR individuals;
and URO, the final degradation product of BR, was detectable only in
the bacteria of VU patients (P b 0.00528; Table S4). None of these me-
tabolites accumulated to an amount above the detection limit in healthy
controls, suggesting that haeme catabolism represents a minor pathway
in uninfected individuals. It has been shown that antiretroviral drugs
are potent inhibitors of uridine glucuronyl transferases (UGT), which
are hepatic enzymes responsible for BR metabolism that have also
been identified in some bacteria (McPhee et al., 1996). This could be
one explanation for the lack of accumulation of BR in HIV-untreated pa-
tients (VU), most likely because it is fully degraded by gut bacteria into
URO, which is then accumulated intracellularly. However, accumulation
of the haeme degradation products BV or BR inside the gut bacteria of
patients undergoing ART could be linked to the inhibition of both hepat-
ic and bacterial UGT enzymes. Indeed, one effect of some antiretroviral
regimens is nearly constant hyperbilirubinemia (Wegiel and Otterbein,
2012). This is in agreement with our study: the accumulation of haeme
degradation products (BV/BR) in patients (n = 2) treated with boosted
atazanavir is slightly higher (P b 0.01) compared to that in patients
(n = 2) treated with unboosted atazanavir (1.9-fold) and those (n =
16) treated with a different third antiretroviral drug (2.2-fold). Interest-
ingly, while the gut bacteria of immune responders accumulated BV,
those of non-responders accumulated BR (Table S4). This is of particular
importance because it has been reported that BV, but not BR, reduces
HIV viral infectivity (Wegiel and Otterbein, 2012) and is an important
anti-inflammatory molecule (Fowler, 2004). Therefore, a link between
immune recovery and the capacity of gut bacteria to accumulate BV is
suggested. It is plausible that, under ART, gut bacteria play an indirect
role in the rate of conversion of BV to BR by hepatic enzymes. Thus, be-
cause hepatic BV reductase is strongly induced by its substrate (BV)
(Fowler, 2004), it is plausible that the accumulation of BV by gut bacte-
ria may decrease its diffusion gradient from the colon to epithelial cells,
thereby reducing the conversion of BV to BR. This would help to control
local viral replication and reduce inflammation.
Altogether, the results suggest that gut bacteria most likely assist in-
flammatory and immune recovery by accumulating pro-inflammatory
molecules and controlling the production of molecules that might
have an influence on viral replication.
3.4. Plasma Metabolomics
3.4.1. Metabolic Changes in the Bloodstream vs in the Gut Microbiota
The results of metabolite profiling of plasma samples were further
evaluated to identify whether the metabolic changes in the gut ecosys-
tem have a consequence in the bloodstream. The plasma metabolomes
(Table S5 in the online version at http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ebiom.
2016.04.033.) were less complex than those in the gut microbiota
(Table S3 in the online version at http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ebiom.
2016.04.033.). A scatter plot based on PCA scores obtained from the
set of metabolites that fulfilled the statistical criteria for selection re-
vealed no differences among the groups (Fig. 1b; Fig. S1), indicating
that alterations in the gut ecosystem caused by HIV and ART interven-
tion had no major effect on the overall composition of metabolites in
the bloodstream. It might seem contradictory that we observed numer-
ous differences in the metabolic profile in the gastrointestinal tract but
not in the plasma. The striking absence of abnormalities in the full set
of plasma metabolites in VU patients can be explained by the fact that
naïve patients were, by definition, free of the criteria required for ART
208
S. Serrano-Villar et al. / EBioMedicine 8 (2016) 203–216
 initiation at the moment of the study and that they were therefore in
good immunological condition. Whatever the case, the above results
seem to be contradictory with a recent study (Cassol et al., 2013) that
reported substantial changes in plasma metabolites in HIV subject com-
pared to controls. However, note that this study accounts only for 35
metabolites that distinguish both groups, and that only those are
accounted in the PCA plot, thus explaining the separation of HIV sub-
jects and controls. In our study, the unsupervised scatter plot was gen-
erated using all statistically significant mass features detected (3602 in
total); they include metabolites similar to those previously reported
by Cassol et al. (2013) as distinguishing HIV-infected and uninfected in-
dividuals such as lipids and lipopolysaccharides (Table S5 in the online
version at http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ebiom.2016.04.033.).
3.4.2. Plasma Signatures for Inflammation/Immune Recovery and Microbial
Clearance
An independent t-test did not reveal any plasma metabolite as po-
tential biomarker related to innate immune activation markers. Howev-
er, 3 altered metabolites that are markers of viral infectivity and
inflammation were found, whose biological relevance is discussed
below.
One of the most significant alterations was found in the level of ace-
tyl adenylate. This metabolite accumulated only in the bloodstreams of
immunological responders (IR) and was below the detection limit in
the VU and INR patients and healthy controls (P b 0.00201; Table S4).
This led us to hypothesize that this molecule may be involved in a pro-
tective mechanism. Acetyl adenylate participates in the non-enzymatic
acetylation of histones, the alteration of which has been associated with
the purging of HIV reservoirs, an optimal immunological situation
(Atarashi et al., 2013), cTreg expression (Chen et al., 2009), and the reg-
ulation of thymic function (Chen et al., 2009). Additionally, acetyl
adenylate-mediated protein (including histone) acetylation has been
associated with the reduced expression of factors involved in inflamma-
tory processes (Kohli and Levy, 2009). To test this hypothesis, changes
in histone acetylation were measured in the PBMC samples using west-
ern blot analysis for acetylated histone H3 (AcH3). Low levels of AcH3
were detectable by western blot analysis in VU, INR and healthy control
individuals; however, an intense band indicating the hyper-acetylation
of H3 was observed in PBMC samples of IR patients (Fig. S4). A correla-
tion between the level of acetyl adenylate in plasma and the level of
acetylated histone in PBMC was thus demonstrated. Therefore, the
non-enzymatic acetylation of histones should be considered an impor-
tant process to investigate in the field of HIV cures, as histone acetyla-
tion plays a role in reactivating latent HIV (Atarashi et al., 2013).
The deep analysis used to search for pro-inflammatory and anti-
inflammatory mediators also revealed that neither HIV nor ART has
an influence on the accumulation of leukotrienes such as LTB4 in
the bloodstream, which was found to be secreted to the gastrointes-
tinal tract (see above). However, lipoxin A5 (LXA5), an intermediate
generated from AA, the appearance of which is linked to the resolu-
tion of inflammation (Serhan, 2014) and microbial clearance (Oh
et al., 2011), was found to be accumulated in the plasma samples of
all of the HIV-infected patients. However, it was below the detection
limit in healthy controls (P b 0.01605; Table S4). Additionally, 5,6-
epoxy,18-hydroxy-7E,9E,11Z,14Z,16E-eicosapentaenoic acid (5,6-
epoxy-18-HEPE),
an
intermediate
of
the
metabolism
of
eicopentaenoic acid (Gough et al., 2015), accumulated only in IR pa-
tients (P b 0.02775; Table S4). This metabolite is an intermediate in
the biosynthesis of resolvins, which are potent anti-inflammatory and
pro-solving lipid mediators that also actively clear inflammation and
enhance microbial clearance (Serhan, 2014; Gough et al., 2015).
The consistent identification of anti-inflammatory molecules in plas-
ma samples suggests that the host reacts to HIV infection and its in-
duced chronic inflammation (Somsouk et al., 2014) by promoting the
biosynthesis of pro-solving inflammatory and microbial clearance me-
diators, some of which were particularly abundant in immunological
responders. These conclusions are in agreement with the findings that
bacterial translocation occurs in individuals with chronic HIV infection
but is minimal in healthy individuals and that over-production of
these molecules may also help to control the clearance of microbial
products that are released into the systemic circulation (Sandler and
Douek, 2012).
3.5. Gut bacterial Proteomics
3.5.1. Associations between HIV, ART, CD4+ T Cell Recovery and Gut
Microbes' Protein Synthesis
We selected a shotgun metaproteomic approach to measure the
functional expression of the microbiomes in the VU, IR, INR and control
groups. We captured the protein expression profiles and the differences
in the composition and abundance of proteins being expressed and the
active community members expressing them (Table S6 in the online ver-
sion at http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ebiom.2016.04.033.) were evaluated
in a subset of samples: 5 VU, 7 IR and 4 INR patients, and 6 HIV− individ-
uals. Additionally, 6-weeks longitudinal samples for 6 of those individ-
uals (VU: 1; IR: 3; HIV−: 2) were analysed. Samples were selected to
cover the widest spectrum of sampling factors (Table S1 in the online
version at http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ebiom.2016.04.033.). According
to protein expression profiles, an unsupervised scatter plot based on
PCA scores revealed a clear separation not only in the uninfected and in-
fected groups of patients but also in the three HIV-infected sub-groups
(Fig. 3). The taxonomic distribution of the identified expressed proteins
at the family level (Table S5 in the online version at http://dx.doi.org/
10.1016/j.ebiom.2016.04.033.) also demonstrates the separation be-
tween the patient groups (Fig. 4) and that different bacteria are being ac-
tive in each disease condition. No variations were observed in the level of
expression (Fig. 3) and active taxa (Fig. 4) in the consecutive measure-
ments. This trend was also found by examining bacterial metabolite pro-
files (Fig. 1a). Taken together, changes in gut metabolism in HIV-infected
individuals are a direct consequence of the differential expression of pro-
teins by distinct sets of active bacteria and that the intra-individual var-
iability in the bacterial proteomes and metabolomes was not significant
in this study.
Proteome data can provide estimation of the taxonomic diversity of
potentially active bacteria. We used Primer 6 (version 6.1.16) and
PERMANOVA+ (version 1.0.6) from the company Primer-E to deter-
mine the richness and evenness of the identified proteins. The alpha-
diversity indexes (Fig. 5) showed that the healthy control subjects had
highly variable active gut microbiota diversities. This may agree with
the fact that in the absence of health pressures (i.e. the presence of a dis-
ease) the gut microbiota is an ecosystem with high inter-individual bac-
terial heterogeneity as compared to a scenario where a strong pressure
(here, viral infection) exists. Also notice there is substantial inter-
individual heterogeneity in the IR patients compared to that in VU and
INR. This may agree with the fact that these patients are characterized
by a healthier gastrointestinal tract and that the viral infection is not
such a strong pressure factor as in VU and INR patients characterized
by extensive structural, functional, and immunological changes in the
intestines. No statistically significant differences were found in species
richness (Fig. 5a), evenness (Fig. 5b) and Shannon index (Fig. 5c)
when comparing controls and VU groups (P N 0.134), indicating that
the viral infection per se does not influence significantly the active frac-
tion of the microbiota. This may explain the similarity between the mi-
crobes' metabolic activity in HIV-negative and VU groups of individuals
(Fig. 1a). However, we found that ART-treated patients had significantly
higher richness (Fig. 5a) of active species and a lower evenness index
(Fig. 5b) compared to VU (P b 0.026) and healthy control (P b 0.036)
groups; no significant differences between INR and IR groups were
found (P N 0.078). This indicates that in treated patients the relative
abundances of taxa in the active subset were less equally distributed
among widespread bacterial groups.

 3.5.2. Active Bacterial Biomarkers of HIV-Infection
Bacteria belonging to the Prevotellaceae, Acidaminococcaceae,
Bacteroidaceae,
Desulfovibrionaceae,
Enterobacteriaceae,
Erysip-
elotrichaceae, Eubacteriaceae, Lachnospiraceae and Veillonellaceae
families have been previously identified as active biomarkers in HIV-
infected patients. This was revealed by high-resolution total bacterial
community profiling and direct DNA sequencing (Mutlu et al., 2014;
Vázquez-Castellanos et al., 2015). By examining the taxonomic assign-
ments of the proteins that are expressed (Table S6 in the online version
at http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ebiom.2016.04.033.; Fig. 4), only the en-
richment of proteins from the Acidaminococcaceae family was identi-
fied as an active biomarker of HIV infection (Fig. 6a). This suggests
Fig. 3. Changes in protein expression profiles. The metaproteomic analysis PCO plot shows the similarity in the abundance of quantified proteins in each individual (Bray Curtis similarity;
Bray and Curtis, 1957). An Analysis of Similarities (ANOSIM) revealed significant differences in protein abundance between groups with a global R of 0.668 at a significance level of 0.01%.
Compared to the uninfected group, the Significant Percentages (SIMPER) analyses yielded an average dissimilarity of 82.22% in comparison to the VU group, 74.22% in comparison to the IR
group and 72.31% in comparison to the INR group, with a cut off for low contributions at 90%. Symbol codes are included in the figure. The 6-weeks longitudinal samples, label as “_T” (for
time), are incorporated in the PCA with empty symbols.
Fig. 4. Taxonomic distribution of proteins that are expressed by gut bacteria at the family level. The taxonomy bar-chart was built with Unipept and is based on the peptides that we
identified with the Mascot-Server. In the upper row, the number of totally identified peptides with the Mascot-Server are shown for each individual. The second row shows the id (#)
of the individuals within groups, which are shown in the third row. The 6-weeks longitudinal samples, label as “_T” (for time), are incorporated right to the same initial sample. Note:
we are aware that the classification based on family level allows a gross interpretation of the active members and their functions. Unfortunately, the peptide information commonly
obtained by metaproteomics does not allow a deeper taxonomic characterization. Analyzing the phylogeny of all peptides (after quality check) already enabled the affiliation down to
family level of only approximately 50% of the peptides in each sample; the others could be either assigned to levels of phyla or order.
210
S. Serrano-Villar et al. / EBioMedicine 8 (2016) 203–216
 that bacteria of this taxon are among the most active biomarkers that
distinguish infected from uninfected individuals and that, from a func-
tional point of view, the metabolic potential of the other bacterial
groups to contribute to HIV-induced structural, functional and immu-
nological deficits may be lower than was previously thought. It should
be noted that an increase in the relative abundance of bacteria of the
Acidaminococcaceae family has been associated with future linear
growth deficits (Isanaka et al., 2009) and that growth failure is common
among infected children with HIV (Rush et al., 2008). We further ob-
served
three
additional
biomarkers
for
the
HIV
group,
the
Clostridiaceae, Bifidobacteriaceae and Ruminococcaceae families,
which, opposite to the previous group, were significantly decreased in
HIV-infected patients (Fig. 6a). Such groups have not been found to be
differentially abundant when examining 16S rRNA datasets in HIV-
infected patients (Mutlu et al., 2014; Vázquez-Castellanos et al.,
2015), possibly because of the low abundance of these bacterial groups
in the total gut community.
We used the linear discriminative analysis (LDA) effect size (LEfSe)
biomarker discovery tool to elucidate which active families were driving
divergences between the groups (P b 0.01) and to identify active bio-
markers in immunological responders. We found 3 families for healthy
controls, 2 for VU and 2 for IR with LDA scores higher than 4 (Fig. 6b).
None was found for the INR group. Active biomarkers for healthy controls
are bacteria that belong to the Ruminococcaceae, Clostridiaceae and
Bifidobacteriaceae families; bacteria of these families were significantly
enriched in healthy controls. In the VU group, Prevotellaceae and
Brachyspiraceae were the active biomarkers, as they were significantly
enriched in this group. Finally, bacteria of the families Succinivibrionaceae
and Erysipelotrichaceae were significantly enriched in the IR group, and
thus they were biomarkers of immune recovery in HIV-infected patients.
3.5.3. Bacteria Controlling the Accumulation of Mediators Implicated in
Immune Recovery
Members of the Succinivibrionaceae family which were found to be
significantly activated in IR patients (see Fig. 6b), have also been found
to be enriched at the level of total community composition in ART-
treated HIV individuals with good CD4 T cell reconstitution compared
to healthy subjects (Vázquez-Castellanos et al., 2015). Bacteria of the
family Succinivibrionaceae are quite undiscovered bacteria whose pro-
tective role against gut inflammation has been suggested in the porcine
colon during nematode infection (Li et al., 2012). It is therefore plausible
that these bacteria might play an active metabolic role in immune

 recovery. One possibility is that they participate in the active transport
and accumulation of anti-inflammatory, viral inhibitors and pro-
solving lipid mediators, such as LTB4, BV and cannabinoid N-acyl am-
ides, which were found to be accumulated inside the gut bacterial
cells of immune responders (Table S4). This hypothesis is supported
by the fact that a solute-binding domain of the SLC5/6 protein trans-
porter (gi|671,503,691) binned to Succinivibrionaceae was exclusively
expressed in this group of patients (Table S6 in the online version at
http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ebiom.2016.04.033.). No other transporter
protein was found to be specifically expressed in the IR group of pa-
tients. Experimental evidence has shown that SLC5/6 transporters do
participate in the transport of complex molecules, such as neurotrans-
mitters (Wright et al., 2004).
To prove whether bacteria of the family Succinivibrionaceae are able
to actively transport molecules that help resolving inflammation and im-
mune recovery, an experimental assay was performed. Briefly, cultures of
Succinivibrio dextrinosolvens (type strain DSM-3072; DSMZ, Braunchweig,
Germany), a gut bacterium of the Succinivibrionaceae family, were
established in medium 330 (anaerobic, 37 °C, 2 weeks) in the presence
of BV and oleamide (10 mg/L; Sigma Aldrich, Madrid, Spain). As control
strains, we used Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO, Escherichia coli K12, Staph-
ylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis, which were grown as previ-
ously reported (Kubacka et al., 2007) in the presence of BV and
oleamide (10 mg/L). After cultivation, bacterial cells were separated,
and the concentrations of both metabolites in the supernatant and bacte-
rial cells were measured (see Materials and Methods). We found a resid-
ual percentage of both metabolites at the end of the assay in supernatants
of S. dextrinosolvens cultures, and concomitant accumulation inside bacte-
rial cells (Fig. S5). Although, this strain may not be the same as the one
detected in the gut ecosystem of IR patients, it demonstrates that bacteria
of the Succinivibrionaceae family are able to efficiently transport mole-
cules implicated in inflammatory and immune recovery. Note that no ac-
cumulation (or a level below the detection limit) of both metabolites was
detected inside the control strains (Fig. S5).
3.5.4. Correlations between Markers of Innate and Adaptive Immunity and
Active Gut Microbiota
Finally, we used the Generalized Linear Model (GLM) to explore the
interactions between the abundance level of active taxonomic groups ex-
pressing proteins (Table S6 in the online version at http://dx.doi.org/10.
1016/j.ebiom.2016.04.033.) and immunological and genetic markers in-
volved in HIV immune-pathogenesis. In particular, we focused on finding
statistically significant associations using active bacterial biomarkers
(Erysipelotrichaceae and Succinivibrionaceae) of the IR group. There
was a correlation between the degree of the CD4+ T cell activation marker
%HLA-DR+CD38+ and the percentage of active Erysipelotrichaceae (Rho
Spearman correlation index = − 0.821; P = 0.034) and between the
CD4/CD8 ratio and the percentage of active Succinivibrionaceae (Rho =
0.857; P = 0.023). No other active bacterial group, from those identified
by proteomic analysis, were systemic markers for those variables. Note
that, %HLA-DR+CD38+ and CD4/CD8 ratio are immunological markers
of immune activation and are predictors of inflammation and mortality
during HIV infection (Hunt et al., 2011; Serrano-Villar et al., 2014). Indeed,
IR patients are characterized by lower inflammation compared to VU pa-
tients due to the absence of viral replication and a partially recovered im-
mune system. The over-abundance of active Erysipelotrichaceae and
Succinivibrionaceae in IR individuals may thus correlate with better levels
of immuno-activation and immune function, and the level of abundance
may help reduce excess mortality.
We further found that the abundance of active Bifidobacteriaceae
was associated with a higher level of HDL cholesterol (Rho = 0.954;
P = 0.00080). This bacterial group was significantly depleted in HIV-
infected patients compared to healthy controls at the level of active mi-
crobiota (Fig. 6a); in HIV-infected patients, depletion was most associat-
ed with the VU and INR groups, while it was detected at a higher level in
the IR group (Fig. 6). Bifidobacteria are powerful bacteria that can
protect the gut, boost the immune system and control inflammatory re-
sponses (Fujimura et al., 2010). Therefore, it is plausible that the occur-
rence, albeit at low levels (Fig. 6), of active Bifidobacteria in the gut of IR
patients may be an additional element that contributes to the improve-
ment of health status in these patients, e.g., favouring the HDL choles-
terol levels that are known to be associated with lower cardiovascular
risk.
Finally, Acidaminococcaceae, which is an active (or functional) bio-
marker of HIV-infection as identified here (Fig. 6a), was associated
with the level of CD4 (Rho = 0.821; P = 0.034), and no other active bac-
terial group was associated with this marker. As Acidaminococcaceae
was also a biomarker at the level of the total microbiota as determined
by 16S rRNA analysis (Vázquez-Castellanos et al., 2015), a correlation
between abundance and function (in this study) of this bacterial
group during HIV infection and CD4 recovery is demonstrated. No
such agreement between abundance and function was found for
Erysipelotrichaceae, Succinivibrionaceae and Bifidobacteria, as they
were biomarkers when considering the active components of the mi-
crobiota but not the total microbiota (Vázquez-Castellanos et al., 2015).
4. Discussion
As for other diseases and disorders (Marchesi et al., 2015), there is a
strong interest in identifying next-generation information to describe
how HIV infection impacts the gut environment and the microbiota
inhabiting it (Vyboh et al., 2015). The majority of previous studies inves-
tigated the gut microbiota during viral infection at the level of total spe-
cies (DNA). These studies observed different shifts as a consequence of
HIV infection and ART. Our results provided an additional vision about
the impact of HIV infection, antiretroviral therapy and immune recovery
in the gut microbiota at the level of protein synthesis and metabolism,
which are indicators of the active processes occurring in the gastrointes-
tinal tract. The study included 8 healthy HIV-uninfected controls and 29
HIV-infected patients, 6 of whom were examined longitudinally.
The data herein presented showed that each of the four groups in-
vestigated possesses a unique active microbiota. Remarkably, during
HIV infection and in the absence of antiretroviral therapy, the numerous
structural, functional, and immunological changes in the intestines
(Vujkovic-Cvijin et al., 2013) seems to provoke the activation of a spe-
cialized subset of bacterial phylotypes that are different to those in un-
infected individuals (Fig. 4), but that are equally diverse, rich and active.
Therefore, HIV infection per se did not alter significantly gut ecosystem
function, but rather affect to fundamental properties. The metabolic def-
icits observed in the comparisons of infected and uninfected patients
could be explained by HIV-induced changes in, for example, epithelial
disruption (Sandler and Douek, 2012). Indeed, it is plausible that during
HIV infection, pathogenic species scavenging mucosa components such
as sialic and dolichol-moieties (Crick and Rip, 1989) and ceramide lipids
(Bouhours and Bouhours, 1985) are significantly increased. These mol-
ecules can be accumulated inside bacterial cells, where they can encour-
age pathological microbe growth and induce loss of epithelial cell
integrity and translocation of pathogenic bacterial products into the
bloodstream, commonly observed in HIV infected patients (Severi
et al., 2007; Cassol et al., 2013).
Comparisons of patients receiving ART or not, demonstrated that pa-
tients receiving ART, whatever the level of immune recovery, had the
highest and most similar active bacterial richness and lowest evenness.
This contrasts with the previous evidences showing a lower bacterial
richness and diversity in patients receiving ART, particularly in the INR
group, using 16S RNA amplicons (Noguera-Julian et al., 2016). This is
an important result, as the active microbiota, namely that with protein
synthesis, potentially is more essential for the host than the inactive
(total) microbiota because of factors such as metabolic turnover. Albeit
being similarly diverse and even, both groups of individuals contain a
distinctive set of active taxa (Fig. 4) that behave functionally distinct
(Fig. 1a). While the increase in richness and active taxa in INR
212
S. Serrano-Villar et al. / EBioMedicine 8 (2016) 203–216
 individuals is not translated to changes in the overall ecosystem func-
tion compared to that in the VU patients and healthy control, in IR pa-
tients it does. We suggest therefore, that the degree of immune
recovery is not associated to a change in the richness of active bacteria,
but rather to an ecosystem similarly diverse but with different set of
metabolically distinct species.
We found that the changes associated to IR group of individuals were
not evident in the blood, particularly among ART treated patients. There-
fore, we found that gut bacteria metabolism is a best marker of adequate
immune recovery. This was found both at the level of microbes´ protein
synthesis and microbes´ metabolic activity regardless sampling factors,
thus reinforcing the significance of the findings. This was not suggested
by previous studies when evaluating the total microbial composition
(Vujkovic-Cvijin et al., 2013; Mutlu et al., 2014; Vázquez-Castellanos
et al., 2015). This prompted us to suggest that inferring metabolic conse-
quences during HIV infection based solely on taxonomic classification
(total microbiota at the DNA level) is unrealistic and that studies at the ac-
tive (functional) level are needed (Moya and Ferrer, 2016).
Although HIV cannot target bacteria, it is worth considering what ef-
fects that antiretroviral drugs used to treat the viral infection might have
on the gut microbiota. One possibility is that immune recovery might in-
duce alterations in microbiome profiles in the gut environment. Indeed,
recent studies linked bacterial richness with immune function (Nowak
et al., 2015). However, the results of this study reinforce also the hypoth-
esis that favourable changes in the gut ecosystem may also be counted as
additional contributors to the recovery of mucosal and systemic immuni-
ty. In this context, we found that the antiretroviral therapy most likely
drastically decreased the abundance of pathogenic species involved in
glycan and lipid (ceramide) modification, thereby most likely favouring
the integrity of the colonic surface and the maintenance of its functions
(Deeks et al., 2013; Masoodi et al., 2013). Other concrete examples that
demonstrate the role of gut bacteria as being fundamental for aiding in
inflammation and immune recovery involve the metabolism of pro-
and anti-inflammatory mediators. Indeed, our data demonstrate that
gut bacteria, most likely bacteria of the family Succinivibrionaceae, may
play a role in controlling the accumulation of pro-inflammatory mole-
cules that would otherwise promote inflammation in the gut environ-
ment (Serhan, 2014). This is the case for the leukotriene LTB4, which
might be less likely to accumulate in the gastrointestinal tract when it
is accumulated in the gut bacteria. Leukotrienes are potent pro-
inflammatory lipid mediators (Bertin et al., 2012). Therefore, reducing
their concentration in the large intestine may exert a positive effect
that mitigates inflammation and the loss of mucosal epithelium. This
may play a direct role in promoting immune recovery because the capac-
ity of gut bacteria to accumulate LTB4 was only observed in ART re-
sponders. Similarly, gut bacterial members (e.g., bacteria of the family
Succinivibrionaceae and possibly Erysipelotrichaceae as suggested by
taxonomic assignments of transport proteins being expressed) may
also contribute to the accumulation of additional molecules that have
the ability to reduce viral infection (i.e., BV) and signalling molecules
(i.e., oleamide) that help to reduce inflammation (Froldi et al., 1992;
Genis et al., 1992; Bertin et al., 2012). Other bacteria such as the
Bifidobacteria may also be implicated in additional health benefits.
While gut bacteria help to control the accumulation of important
molecules that are associated with inflammation, immune recovery
and viral infectivity, we also demonstrated that human cells respond
by increasing the biosynthesis of anti-inflammatory and pro-solving
lipid mediators that circulate in the plasma and help diminishing in-
flammation (Isanaka et al., 2009), and controlling HIV replication (e.g.
by non-enzymatic acetylation of histones). An orchestrated solution to
inflammation is thus plausible between the host and the gut ecosystem
that is aimed at helping to reduce inflammation and boost immune re-
covery (for a summary see Fig. 7). It is therefore plausible that the met-
abolic connection between the host and the gut ecosystem is stronger
than previously thought and that they can work together to improve
immune recovery. It will be important to identify the mechanisms by
which such metabolic connections are established and to clearly identi-
fy whether an HIV-infected individual responds better to ART as a result
of the additional contributions of the microbiota or whether the gut bac-
teria metabolism is altered as a consequence of the improvement in
health of the host after ART. This last hypothesis may agree with the
fact that human genetics and human health shape the gut microbiome
(Goodrich et al., 2014). Although, we cannot rule out either of these
two possibilities, this study supports the first hypothesis: a specialized
subset of active microorganisms structured in a more even configura-
tion than the total gut community (Vujkovic-Cvijin et al., 2013;
Vázquez-Castellanos et al., 2015) is implicated in key inflammation
and immune traits. Thus, we reasoned that the accumulation of pro-
inflammatory molecules during HIV infection may be one of the most
easily controlled factors that can modulate the composition of the active
microbiota, which is shifted to reduce their concentration in the gut en-
vironment and to help immune and inflammation recovery.
We would like to stress that one of the limitations of this study is that,
while we have the ability to show associations, we can only demonstrate
causality to a limited extent. In addition to that, although the set of active
bacteria and molecular agents identified herein may not be the only ones
contributing to immune recovery in HIV-infected patients, they certainly
may play a key role in HIV progression and chronic immune response,
and thus life expectancy, in HIV patients during effective ART. Also, the
observed associations do not necessarily indicate an effect of gut micro-
biota on immune-reconstitution and inflammation. Other possible ex-
planations could be that immune-reconstitution and inflammation
influence gut microbiota or that other unexplored factors linked to HIV
infection, antiretroviral therapy, immune-reconstitution and inflamma-
tion could impact on gut bacteria environment.
We are aware also that the only way to definitively evaluate the im-
pact of ART on the gut microbiome is to study the microbiota in patients
prior to ART initiation followed by the analyses of changes during ART.
Similarly, the only way to evaluate definitively the effect of HIV is to
study HIV-uninfected patients and to analyze the effects following HIV
infection. While these studies will likely come and provide definitive
data, the complexity inherent to these study designs has hampered
so far its development in humans, and we feel that cross-sectional
studies still provide valuable data to approach the problem. In-
creasing the size of all of the cohorts would improve the signifi-
cance of the findings. Following on from this, while the present
manuscript is focused on the associations between the gut micro-
biota metabolism and systemic markers, the existence of a group
of patients with repeated measurements after six-weeks offers
the opportunity to account for intra-individual variability in a sub-
group of patients. We overall observed no changes in the analysed
data in this subgroup, thus reinforcing the significance of the findings,
which were herein confirmed also by two distinct but complementary
omics approaches.
While our study is focused on HIV-infected individuals, our findings
should be of general interest because our data suggest the need to assess
the metabolic contribution of gut bacteria to recovery or to the mainte-
nance or persistence of defects in innate and adaptive immunity across
different diseases.
5. Conclusions
We herein report the study of HIV-infected individuals analyzing the
effects of HIV infection, antiretroviral therapy and immune recovery on
gut microbiota, particularly on microbes´ protein synthesis and mi-
crobes´ metabolic activity. We found that, compared to a healthy situa-
tion, the HIV infection per se is a pressure factor to which gut microbiota
react without an overall effect in diversity, richness and activity. We fur-
ther found that the antiretroviral intervention is safe and well tolerated
from a metabolic point of view, albeit it provokes that an additional set
of bacterial species react, the nature of which is different depending on
the immune recovery level of the individuals. Although we cannot rule
213
S. Serrano-Villar et al. / EBioMedicine 8 (2016) 203–216
 out the possibility that some of these changes are partially a random
consequence, our data demonstrate also that others are a cause by
which a subset of bacterial species become active to help controlling
the accumulation of molecular agents and promote immune and in-
flammation recovery in HIV-infected patients undergoing antiretroviral
therapy. We also found relationships between gut bacteria and host
which most likely influence the immune recovery.

Fig. 7. Proposed mechanisms for the contribution of gut bacteria and human cell products to the recovery of mucosal and systemic immunity during HIV infection. (a) The intestinal
epithelium in a healthy individual. A continuous enterocyte lining with intact tight junctions promotes barrier integrity and prevents the translocation of commensal bacteria from the
intestinal lumen into the intestinal wall. The microbiota comprises active microbiota species that yield a defined repertoire of expressed proteins and metabolites that interact with the
gut mucosa. Human cells promote immune-tolerance mechanisms. No inflammation occurs in this healthy state. (b) The intestinal epithelium in an HIV-infected individual not
receiving ART. These individuals are characterized by progressive immunodeficiency, immune hyper-activation and excess mortality. The microbiota comprises a distinct set of active
microbiota species that yield a different repertoire of expressed proteins and metabolites than those documented in healthy individuals. The cleavage of sialic and dolichol
components from epithelial cells by gut bacteria causes abnormal glycan composition in enterocytes; this leads to the destruction of tight junctions and increased microbial
translocation. Human cells increase the production of lipotoxins, which accumulate in the bloodstream. The biosynthesis of leukotrienes also increases, and they accumulate in the gut
environment (faecal fluid), promoting inflammation and toxicity. (c) The intestinal epithelium in an HIV-infected individual who is an immunological ART responder. The individual is
characterized by the variable recovery of the mucosal architecture and immune functions, low-level inflammation and subtle health vulnerability. Distinct active species (including
Bifidobacteria), proteins and metabolites characterize this individual. The cleavage of epithelial cell components by gut bacteria is limited to the cleavage of dolichol-glycans, which
lowers the destruction of enterocytes and limits microbial translocation. Gut bacteria (e.g. Succinivibrionaceae family) accumulate AA and its inflammatory mediator LTB4 in addition
to the cannabinoid oleamide and biliverdin (a viral inhibitor), which may contribute to health recovery by inhibiting viral replication, stimulating the immune system, and ultimately
reducing inflammation. Human cells reciprocally increase the biosynthesis of anti-inflammatory and pro-solving lipid mediators (the resolving intermediate 5,6-epoxy-18-HEPE) and
lipotoxins, which circulate in the bloodstream. (d) The intestinal epithelium in an HIV-infected ART non-responder. This individual is characterized by chronic mucosal impairment,
systemic immune impairment, chronic inflammation and excess mortality. The set of microbial products in this individual are most similar to those in the ART-untreated patients. N-
glycan metabolism occurs as in (c). Lipotoxins and leukotrienes are also produced as in (b). Gut bacteria accumulate bilirubin.
