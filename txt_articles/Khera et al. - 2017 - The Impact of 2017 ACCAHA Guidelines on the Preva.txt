ABSTRACT 
BACKGROUND: The 2017 American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA) guideline 
recommendations for hypertension include major changes to the diagnosis of hypertension as well as suggested 
treatment targets for blood pressure management. To better guide future health policy interventions in the 
management of hypertension, we examined the effect of these guidelines on the prevalence as well as the eligibility 
for initiation and intensification of therapy in nationally-representative populations from the US and China. 
METHODS: In the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) for the most recent 2 cycles 
(2013-2014 and 2015-2016), and the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS) (2011-2012), we 
identified all adults 45 to 75 years of age who would have a diagnosis of hypertension, and would be candidates for 
initiation and intensification of anti-hypertensive therapy based on the 2017 ACC/AHA guidelines, compared with 
current guidelines. 
RESULTS: The adoption of the 2017 ACC/AHA guidelines for hypertension in the US would label 70.1 million 
individuals in the 45-75-year age group with hypertension, representing 63% of the population in this age-group. 
The adoption of these guidelines in China would lead to labeling of 267 million or 55% individuals in the same age-
group with hypertension. This would represent a relative increase in the prevalence of hypertension by 26.8% in the 
US and 45.1% in China with the adoption of the new guidelines. Further, based on observed treatment patterns and 
current guidelines, 8.1 million Americans with hypertension are currently untreated. However, this number is 
expected to increase to 15.6 million after the implementation of the 2017 ACC/AHA guidelines. In China, based on 
current treatment patterns, 74.5 million patients with hypertension are untreated, and is estimated to increase to 
129.8 million if the 2017 ACC/AHA guidelines are adopted by China. In addition, the new ACC/AHA guidelines 
will label 8.7 million adults in the US, and 51 million in China with hypertension who would not require treatment 
with an anti-hypertensive agent, compared with 1.5 million and 23.4 million in the current guidelines. Finally, even 
among those treated with anti-hypertensive therapy, the proportion of undertreated individuals, i.e. those above 
target blood pressures despite receiving anti-hypertensive therapy and candidates for intensification of therapy, is 
estimated to increase by 13.9 million (from 24.0% to 54.4% of the treated patients) in the US, and 30 million (41.4% 
to 76.2% of patients on treatment) in China, if the 2017 ACC/AHA treatment targets are adopted into clinical 
practice in the respective countries. 
Conclusions: Adopting the new 2017 ACC/AHA hypertension guidelines would be associated with a substantial 
increase in the prevalence of hypertension in both US and China accompanied with a marked increase in the 
recommendation to initiate and intensify treatment in several million patients. There would be a 26.8% and 45.1% 
increase in those labeled with hypertension in the US and China, respectively. Further, 7.5 million and 55.3 million 
will be newly recommended for therapy, and 13.9 million and 30 million newly recommended for intensification of 
existing therapy in the US and China, respectively. 
  
BACKGROUND 
The American College of Cardiology (ACC) 
and the American Heart Association (AHA) 
recently released guideline recommendations for 
treatment strategies for hypertension with lower 
blood pressure values used to define elevated 
blood pressure, and lower treatment thresholds,1 
than those recommended in current guidelines.2 
These guidelines define hypertension as a

 systolic blood pressure of 130 or greater or a 
diastolic blood pressure of 80 or greater, in 
contrast to a systolic blood pressure of 140 
mmHg or greater or a diastolic blood pressure of 
90 mmHg or greater that was used to define 
hypertension in all prior guidelines. Further, 
treatment 
recommendations 
have 
been 
extensively revised. The current guidelines 
recommend treatment of only a subset of 
patients with a diagnosis of hypertension. This 
includes all individuals with a systolic blood 
pressure of ≥140 mmHg or a diastolic blood 
pressure 
of 
≥90 
mmHg. 
Treatment 
was 
recommended for additional patients with lower 
blood pressures. Among those with a systolic 
blood pressure of 130-139 mmHg or a diastolic 
blood pressure 80-89 mmHg, treatment is 
recommended only for those who meet any of 
the following criteria: aged 65 years or older, 
pre-existing 
atherosclerotic 
cardiovascular 
disease (ASCVD) or a 10-year predicated risk of 
developing ASCVD of 10% or greater, chronic 
kidney disease (CKD), or diabetes mellitus. 
Further, a goal systolic blood pressure below 
130 mmHg and a diastolic blood pressure below 
80 mmHg is recommended for all patients, 
regardless of their baseline blood pressures. 
These recommendations contrast with systolic 
blood pressure targets of less than 140 mmHg 
and diastolic targets of less than 90 mmHg for 
most patients, other than targets of <150/90 
mmHg for those ≥60 years of age without 
concomitant 
diabetes 
or 
CKD, 
suggested 
currently. 2  
The population impact of changes in 
guideline recommendations in the US are 
frequently 
evaluated. 
However, 
an 
understanding of how these recommendations 
translate to non-US populations, who frequently 
implement them, can also provide valuable 
insights into their overall impact. Further, since 
several major clinical studies rely on non-US 
populations, such international assessments of 
US guidelines are essential to appreciate their 
effect on other countries. China, in particular, 
has a high prevalence of hypertension and the 
world’s largest population. Recent studies 
suggest that even with current guidelines, a large 
proportion of adults in China are classified as 
hypertensive and few people are achieve blood 
pressure targets. Therefore, the impact of their 
adoption of these standards is important to 
understand.  
  
Using nationally representative data 
from the United States and China, two diverse 
health systems, we examined the changes in 
prevalence, and eligibility for anti-hypertensive 
therapy and treatment intensification, based on 
current and the revised 2017 ACC/AHA 
guidelines.  
 
METHODS 
Data Sources and Study Population 
We used contemporary data from large, 
nationally representative datasets from the US 
and China, which have been designed to assess 
the 
health 
status 
of 
community-dwelling 
individuals. For the US, we used the National 
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 
(NHANES) for the most recent 2 cycles - 2013-
2014 and 2015-2016, and for China, we used the 
baseline survey of the China Health and 
Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS) 
conducted in 2011-2012.3,4 The structure of 
these datasets and their use to identify 
hypertensive 
adults 
have 
been 
described 
previously. 
Briefly, 
the 
NHANES, 
is 
a 
nationally representative database comprised of 
cross-sectional 
national 
surveys 
with 
information on demographic characteristics, 
medical history, prescription drug use, and 
laboratory testing on a set of individuals. The 
data in NHANES can be weighted to obtain 
nationally 
representative 
estimates. 
The 
CHARLS is a longitudinal study of 17,500 
individuals >45 years of age from 150 
counties/districts and 450 villages in China with 
a detailed baseline clinical evaluation in 2011-
2012 when data on demographic characteristics, 
medical history, prescription drug use, and 
laboratory testing was collected.3,4 Further, 
similar to the NHANES, the data in CHARLS is 
nationally representative for China, and can be 
weighted to obtain national estimates for China. 
In both these datasets, we identified all 
adults 45 to 75 years of age with at least two 
blood pressure measurements, and information 
on prescription drug use.  
 
Study Variables 
From each dataset, we obtained information on 
all blood pressure measurements as well as

 variables necessary to classify patients into risk 
groups for anti-hypertensive therapy. This 
included 
information 
on 
demographic 
characteristics (age, sex, and race), clinical 
history (known ASCVD [defined as history of 
myocardial infarction, stroke, angina or reported 
coronary heart disease], smoking, diabetes 
[defined as hemoglobin A1c >6.5% or self-
reported history of diabetes], and use of anti-
hypertensive therapy) as well as laboratory 
values for serum creatinine, and total and high-
density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol.  
 
Statistical Analysis 
First, we calculated the average systolic and 
diastolic blood pressures based on all available 
readings for each patient. Second, we assessed 
the prevalence of hypertension, defined as the 
number of individuals who would have a 
diagnosis of hypertension based on current 
guidelines for both study populations. We use 
the 2014 evidence-based guidelines for the 
management of high blood pressure in adults 
developed by the panel members appointed to 
the eighth Joint National Committee as the 
‘JNC-8’ criteria used in the context of the 
present 
study. 
These 
guidelines 
defined 
hypertension as an average systolic blood 
pressure of 140 mmHg or higher and/or a 
diastolic blood pressure of 90 or higher and/or 
treatment with an antihypertensive agent. We 
then identified individuals with hypertension 
based on the 2017 ACC/AHA guidelines. This 
included all adults meeting a definition based on 
the prior JNC-8 guidelines, but additionally 
included all adults with a systolic blood pressure 
130-139 mmHg or a diastolic blood pressure of 
80-89 mmHg. Next, we assessed the adults 
qualifying for treatment with one or more anti-
hypertensive agents based on the current 
guidelines and the 2017 ACC/AHA guidelines 
but not receiving treatment (‘non-treatment’).  
This included all patients with a systolic blood 
pressure of 140 mmHg or higher or a diastolic 
blood pressure of 90 mmHg or higher. In 
addition, those with a systolic blood pressure of 
130-139 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure of 
80-89 mmHg were also treatment candidates if 
they were in one or more of high-risk groups: 
age ≥ 65 years, a history of ASCVD (defined as 
history of myocardial infarction, stroke, angina 
or reported coronary heart disease), CKD (based 
on an estimated glomerular filtration rate of <60 
ml/kg/h calculated using serum creatinine and 
the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease study 
equation), diabetes [defined as hemoglobin A1c 
>6.5% or self-reported history of diabetes) or an 
expected 10-year risk of ASCVD of 10% or 
greater (defined using the pooled cohort 
equations).5 Finally, we assessed the number of 
patients who would be considered ‘under-
treated’, based on being above the treatment 
targets defined in the older JNC-8 and the recent 
guidelines. In JNC-8, treatment threshold for 
hypertension were set at <150/90 mmHg for 
adults ≥60 years of age without diabetes or 
CKD, and <140/90 mmHg for all others. In the 
ACC/AHA guidelines, treatment targets were set 
at 130/80 for all patients. We used survey 
analyses with patient-level weights to obtain 
national estimates for both the US and China.  
 
All statistical tests were two-sided and 
the level of significance was set at an alpha of 
0.05. The study was exempt from the purview of 
Yale’s Institutional Review Board since it uses 
de-identified.  
 
RESULTS 
Prevalence of Hypertension: United States 
In 
the 
NHANES 
dataset, 
a 
nationally-
representative data from the United States, we 
found 2,973 participants, representing 55.3 
million nationally (49.7% of the population) 
who 
are 
labeled 
with 
the 
diagnosis 
of 
hypertension based on the JNC-8 guidelines. An 
additional 685 individuals, representing 14.8 
million (13.3% of the population) would be 
classified as hypertensive with the use of blood 
pressure 
cutoffs 
suggested 
in 
the 
2017 
ACC/AHA guidelines. Therefore, 70.1 million 
adults between 45 to 75 years of age would be 
classified as hypertensive based on the 2017 
ACC/AHA guidelines, representing a 26.8% 
relative increase. The proportion of the US adult 
population between 45 and 75 years of age 
classified as hypertensive would increase from 
49.7% based on the JNC-8 guidelines to 63.0% 
based on the 2017 ACC/AHA guidelines. The 
adoption of the new guidelines would be 
associated 
with 
a 
higher 
prevalence 
of 
hypertension across subgroups of sex and age.

 The characteristics of US patients 
labeled with hypertension according to the JNC-
8 guidelines and the 2017 AHA/ACC guidelines 
are included in Table 1. 
 
Prevalence of Hypertension: China 
In 
the 
CHARLS 
dataset, 
a 
nationally 
representative dataset from China, there were 
5,133 individuals in the 45-75-year age-group 
who met the JNC-8 criteria for hypertension, 
representing 
184 
million 
(38.0% 
of 
the 
population) 
labelled 
with 
hypertension 
nationally. An additional 2588 individuals, 
representing 83 million (17% of population) 
nationally would be classified as hypertensive 
based 
on 
the 
2017 
ACC/AHA 
criteria. 
Therefore, 267 million Chinese adults between 
45 and 75 years of age, would be classified as 
hypertensive based on ACC/AHA criteria, 
representing a relative increase of 45.1%. The 
proportion of the Chinese adult population 
between 45 and 75 years of age classified as 
hypertensive would increase from 38.0% based 
on the JNC-8 guidelines to 55% based on the 
2017 ACC/AHA guidelines.  Similar to the US, 
the adoption of the new guidelines would be 
associated 
with 
a 
higher 
prevalence 
of 
hypertension across subgroups of sex and age 
(Figure 1). The characteristics of patients with 
hypertension, based on the two criteria are 
included in Table 1. 
 
Eligibility for Anti-Hypertensive Therapy: 
United States 
In the US, of the 55.3 million individuals with 
hypertension based on JNC-8 criteria, 82.7% 
were receiving one or more anti-hypertensive 
medications, while 14.6% (or 8.1 million 
individuals) were eligible for treatment but not 
receiving any therapy.  Further, 1.5 million 
individuals in JNC-8 would be classified as 
hypertensive, and would qualify for lifestyle 
modifications alone. Of the 70.1 million 
classified 
as 
hypertensive 
based 
on 
the 
ACC/AHA 
guidelines, 
only 
65.3% 
were 
receiving anti-hypertensive therapy, suggesting a 
recommendation to initiate therapy in 22.3% or 
15.6 million individuals with hypertension (an 
additional 7.5 million individuals). Notably, 
under the 2017 ACC/AHA guidelines, the 
remaining 12.4% (or 8.7 million) of US adults in 
45-75-year age-group would have hypertension, 
but not be candidates for anti-hypertensive 
therapy because they had a systolic blood 
pressure of 130-139 and/or a diastolic blood 
pressure 80-89 mmHg and without any of the 
high-risk conditions, such as age≥65 years, 
known ASCVD or a 10-year predicted risk of 
ASCVD of ≥10%, CKD, or diabetes. Moreover, 
of those receiving anti-hypertensive therapy, 
24.0% were above the treatment targets for JNC-
8 and 54.4% were above the treatment targets 
based on the ACC/AHA criteria. Therefore, an 
additional 13.9 million individuals will be 
candidates for intensification of therapy. The 
rates of non-treatment and under treatment of 
hypertension among subgroups of age and sex 
are presented in Figures 2 and 3. 
 
Eligibility for Anti-Hypertensive Therapy: 
China 
In China, based on JNC-8 blood pressure targets, 
46.8% of the 184 million individuals with 
hypertension were receiving one or more anti-
hypertensive medications. Among the 267 
million classified as hypertensive based on the 
2017 
ACC/AHA 
guidelines, 
32.3% 
were 
receiving anti-hypertensive therapy. The use of 
JNC-8 and 2017 ACC/AHA criteria to define 
treatment-eligible individuals would recommend 
the initiation of treatment in 74.5 million and 
129.8 million patients (an additional 55.3 
million individuals), respectively. Further, 23.4 
million individuals in JNC-8 and 51.0 million 
individuals in the ACC/AHA guidelines would 
be classified as hypertensive, and would qualify 
for lifestyle modifications alone. This group 
included individuals with a systolic blood 
pressure of 130-139 and/or a diastolic blood 
pressure 80-89 mmHg and without any of the 
high-risk conditions, such as age≥65 years, 
known ASCVD or a 10-year predicted risk of 
ASCVD of ≥10%, CKD, or diabetes. 
Finally, 
of 
those 
receiving 
anti-
hypertensive therapy in China in 2011-2012, 
41.4% were above the treatment targets for JNC-
8, and 76.2% were above the treatment targets 
based on the ACC/AHA criteria. Therefore, an 
additional 30 million individuals would be 
candidates for intensification of therapy, based 
on the change in the guidelines. The rates of

DISCUSSION 
The adoption of the 2017 ACC/AHA guidelines 
for hypertension in the US would classify 70.1 
million individuals in the 45-75-year age group 
with hypertension, representing 63% of the 
population in this age group. The adoption of 
these guidelines in China would lead to the 
classification of 267 million or 55% individuals 
in 
the 
same 
group 
as 
suffering 
from 
hypertension. This would represent a relative 
increase of 26.8% in the US and 45.1% in China 
from 
prevalence 
based 
on 
current 
recommendations. 
Further, 
based 
on 
the 
observed 
treatment 
patterns 
and 
current 
guidelines, 
8.1 
million 
Americans 
with 
hypertension are currently untreated. However, 
this number is expected to increase to 15.6 
million after the implementation of the 2017 
ACC/AHA guidelines. In China, based on 
current treatment patterns, 74.5 million patients 
with hypertension are untreated and is likely to 
increase to 129.8 million if the 2017 ACC/AHA 
guidelines are adopted. Finally, even among 
those treated with anti-hypertensive therapy, the 
proportion of undertreated individuals, i.e. those 
above target blood pressures despite receiving 
anti-hypertensive therapy, is likely to increase 
by 13.9 million (from 24.0% to 54.4% of the 
treated patients) in the US, and 30 million 
(41.4% to 76.2% of patients on treatment) in 
China, if the 2017 ACC/AHA treatment targets 
are adopted into clinical practice. 
The lowering of the treatment target for 
higher risk subgroups in the 2017 ACC/AHA is 
guided by evidence for a reduced rate of major 
adverse cardiovascular events.6-8 However, even 
based on the more conservative guidelines, the 
appropriate management of patients with anti-
hypertensive 
therapy 
has 
posed 
major 
implementation challenges with high rates of 
non- and under-treatment in both the US and 
China.9-11 The ACC/AHA guidelines would 
require 
expansion 
of 
the 
public 
health 
infrastructure 
necessary 
to 
manage 
the 
substantial increase in the public health burden 
of hypertension in both the US and China. 
Further, health policy interventions focusing on 
appropriately treating recommended individuals 
would need to identify 7.5 million additional 
untreated Americans in the 45-75-year age-
group, in addition to the 8.1 million who are not 
receiving 
treatment 
based 
on 
current 
recommendations. However, a similar effort in 
China would require identification of an 
additional 55.3 million untreated patients with 
hypertension, in addition to the 74.5 million 
currently with an unmet need for anti-
hypertensive 
therapy. 
The 
rates 
of 
non-
treatment, in combination with rates of under-
treatment, 
suggest 
that 
health 
system 
interventions would need to address treatment in 
nearly all patients with hypertension. 
Our study should be interpreted in the 
light of the following limitations. First, the data 
is based on cross-sectional surveys, with a 
potential for sampling error. However, since our 
estimates are based on a large subset of sampled 
individuals in both the NHANES and CHARLS, 
and are associated with a relative standard error 
of <10% for all estimates, the observations are 
likely to be reliable. Second, the assessment of 
national estimates was limited to adults 45 to 75 
years of age, corresponding to the age group of 
individuals surveyed for the CHARLS study. 
Therefore, additional people <45 years and >75 
years of age in both US and China may have 
hypertension, and be candidates for anti-
hypertensive therapy. Third, while certain 
variables in both NHANES and CHARLS are 
based on self-reporting and are subject to recall 
bias. However, wherever appropriate we used 
objective data to define conditions (e.g. serum 
creatinine to assess CKD status) or complement 
the diagnoses derived from self-reporting (e.g 
use of A1c data to assess diabetes status). 
Further, data in both NHANES and CHARLS 
are collected by trained and experienced 
interviewers with the goal of reducing the effect 
of such biases. Fourth, a history of ASCVD in 
CHARLS includes those who may have 
congestive heart failure or other heart disease, in 
addition to prior myocardial infarction, stroke, 
coronary heart disease, and angina. Hence, the 
ASCVD rates are higher than the US. This did 
not affect classification with hypertension, 
which was solely based on an elevated blood 
pressure above 130/80 mmHg. A total of 3.7

 million patients (i.e. 1.3% of overall patients) 
became treatment eligible due to ASCVD status 
in CHARLS. However, true ASCVD likely 
represented the vast majority of these patients, 
and the proportion of those with solely 
‘congestive heart failure’ or ‘other heart disease’ 
is likely to be small. Fifth, we compared the 
recent 
guidelines 
against 
blood 
pressure 
definitions and blood pressure targets suggested 
by the members of the expert panel of the 8th 
Joint National Commission, but physicians may 
follow 
different 
guidelines. 
However, 
hypertension has been defined consistently 
across all prior guidelines as a blood pressure 
≥140/90 mmHg. Moreover, treatment targets in 
guidelines like the JNC-7 were more stringent,12 
thereby suggesting an even higher rate of non- 
and under-treatment of hypertension in patients. 
Finally, we do not know if China will adopt 
these guidelines. Our study, however, only 
focuses on the potential impact of the uptake of 
these guidelines by China. 
In conclusion, the adoption of the new 
2017 ACC/AHA guidelines would be associated 
with a marked increase in the prevalence of 
hypertension in both US and China. While 6 
million more US adults would require initiation 
of treatment, adoption in China would increase 
the number of treatment-eligible individuals by 
31 million. There is a large unmet need for 
appropriate hypertensive therapy in China, and 
that challenge will grow further with the 
adoption of these guideline recommendations.
