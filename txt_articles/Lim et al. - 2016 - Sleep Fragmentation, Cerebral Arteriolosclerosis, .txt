leep abnormalities are associated with imaging markers 
of cerebrovascular pathology and with clinical stroke.1,2 
However, some cerebrovascular pathologies, such as arte-
riolosclerosis, cerebral amyloid angiopathy, and microscopic 
infarcts, can only be quantified by histopathology and with 
few exceptions,3 their associations with sleep are unknown. 
This is important because these pathologies contribute not 
only to clinical stroke but also to chronic progressive cogni-
tive4 and motor5 impairment.
We tested the hypothesis that greater sleep fragmentation 
is associated with more severe arteriolosclerosis, atheroscle-
rosis, and cerebral amyloid angiopathy and more macroscopic 
and microscopic pathological infarcts in older adults.
Methods
Full details are available in the online-only Data Supplement.
We studied 315 autopsied individuals with ≥1 actigraphic record-
ing from the Rush Memory and Aging Project, a community-based 
cohort study of aging with brain donation on death.
Sleep fragmentation was assessed biennially by 10 days of 
ambulatory actigraphy using the metric kRA.6 As described in the 
online-only Data Supplement, kRA correlates strongly with polysom-
nographic measures of fragmentation, including the arousal index 
(R=+0.6, P<0.0001) and sleep efficiency (R=−0.6, P<0.0001). The 
mean kRA was 0.029 which at steady-state would correspond to 6.96 
movement arousals per hour.
As in previous work with other risk factors,7 where an individual 
had >1 actigraphic measurement before autopsy, we took the average 
of all measurements. This best reflects the cumulative impact of sleep 
fragmentation, minimizing the effects of individual measurements, 
which could reflect acute or terminal illness. The average participant 
had 3 recordings.
We used an ordinal outcome of 0, 1, or ≥2 infarcts to summarize 
the number of cortical and subcortical microscopic and macroscopic 
infarcts quantified histopathologically as previously described.8 The 
severity of atherosclerosis, arteriolosclerosis, and amyloid angiopa-
thy were quantified by gross and histopathologic examination of the 
Circle of Willis and specific brain regions, and summarized using 
4-point semiquantitative scales as previously described.8,9
Additional actigraphic and clinical covariates were quantified as 
described in the online-only Data Supplement. We used ordinal lo-
gistic regression models to relate sleep fragmentation to the severity 
of each vessel pathology, or the number of subcortical or cortical in-
farcts, adjusting for potential confounders as described in the online-
only Data Supplement.
Results
The mean age at death of the 315 participants was 90.4 
years; 70% were female (Table I in the online-only Data 
Supplement); 29% had a clinical stroke; and 61% of partici-
pants had ≥1 moderate to severe vascular pathology.
Each 1 SD higher sleep fragmentation was associated 
with nearly 30% higher odds of more severe arteriolosclerosis 
Background and Purpose—Although several forms of sleep disruption are associated with stroke, few studies have examined 
the relationship between sleep and histopathologic measures of cerebrovascular disease. We tested the hypothesis that 
greater sleep fragmentation is associated with a higher burden of cerebral vessel and infarct pathology at autopsy.
Methods—We used ordinal logistic regression models to relate sleep fragmentation measured by actigraphy to the severity 
of arteriolosclerosis, atherosclerosis, and cerebral amyloid angiopathy, and the number of macroscopic and microscopic 
infarcts assessed by structured brain autopsy in 315 participants from the Rush Memory and Aging Project.
Results—Greater sleep fragmentation was associated with more severe arteriolosclerosis (odds ratio, 1.27; 95% confidence 
interval, 1.02–1.59; P=0.03 per 1 SD greater sleep fragmentation) and more subcortical macroscopic infarcts (odds ratio, 
1.31; 95% confidence interval, 1.01–1.68; P=0.04). These associations were independent of established cardiovascular 
risk factors and diseases, and several medical comorbidities.
Conclusions—Sleep fragmentation is associated with arteriolosclerosis and subcortical infarcts in older adults.

(Table 1). By contrast, sleep fragmentation was not associated 
with the severity of atherosclerosis or amyloid angiopathy.
Each 1 SD higher sleep fragmentation was also associated 
with >30% higher odds of having more subcortical macro-
scopic infarcts (Table 2); by contrast sleep fragmentation was 
not associated with cortical macroscopic infarcts (column 2), 
with microscopic infarcts (columns 3–4), or with clinically 
evident strokes (odds ratio, 0.95; 95% confidence interval, 
0.72–1.22; P=0.69). Associations were similar for lacunar (≥1 
mm; odds ratio, 1.30; 95% confidence interval, 1.00–1.68) 
and nonlacunar (<1 mm; odds ratio, 1.36; 95% confidence 
interval, 0.96–1.88) infarcts.
Adjusting for arteriolosclerosis attenuated the associa-
tion between sleep fragmentation and subcortical infarcts by 
<5%, indicating that arteriolosclerosis does not account for 
this association (Table II in the online-only Data Supplement).
The associations between sleep fragmentation and arte-
riolosclerosis (Table III in the online-only Data Supplement) 
and subcortical infarcts (Table IV in the online-only Data 
Supplement) remained significant after adjusting for poten-
tial confounders, including date of actigraphy and time of 
autopsy, total daily rest and activity; cardiovascular risk fac-
tors and diseases, and several medical comorbidities including 
Alzheimer pathology, pain, depression, and heart failure. In 
models adjusted for pulmonary and renal function, the asso-
ciations between sleep fragmentation and arteriolosclerosis 
were minimally attenuated. Similarly, in models adjusted 
for circadian irregularity, dementia, coronary disease, and 
renal function, the associations with subcortical infarcts were 
minimally attenuated. Dementia did not modify the associa-
tions with arteriolosclerosis (P=0.29) or subcortical infarcts 
(P=0.86).
Discussion
Our findings may be interpreted in 3 ways: (1) one possibility 
is that cerebrovascular pathology causes sleep fragmentation. 
We previously showed that cell loss in the intermediate 
nucleus is associated with sleep fragmentation.10 However, the 
hypothalamus and other sleep centers represent a tiny volume 
of the brain and hypothalamic infarction is unusual because 
of its rich blood supply.11 Moreover, although individuals 
with clinical stroke symptoms should be the most likely to 
have stroke-induced sleep fragmentation, the associations 
were independent of clinically evident stroke. (2) Although 
the associations between sleep fragmentation and cerebrovas-
cular pathology were independent of established risk factors, 
an unmeasured latent variable may have predisposed to both. 
(3) Sleep fragmentation may contribute to cerebrovascular 
pathology. In support of this, other forms of sleep disruption 
are associated with physiological risk factors for cerebrovas-
cular pathology including diurnal and nocturnal hyperten-
sion12,13 and abnormal glucose processing,12 among others, 
which may be mechanisms linking sleep fragmentation to 
cerebrovascular pathology.
This study had limitations. First, it was observational, lim-
iting determination of causality. Second, although we showed 
that kRA correlates strongly with polysomnographic measures, 
and unlike polysomnography is well tolerated, does not perturb 
sleep, and can record over days, it does not directly measure 
brain electric activity. Third, actigraphy does not distinguish 
between causes of sleep fragmentation. We adjusted for sev-
eral of these in our analyses, including clinical stroke, heart 
disease, dementia, depression, pain, and pulmonary and renal 
function. However, sleep apnea, that is common in patients 
with stroke,14 was not specifically measured, nor were peri-
odic limb movements in sleep. This is relevant given our find-
ing that in patients with sleep apnea, kRA may be a marker of 
sleep apnea severity (online-only Data Supplement). Fourth, 
although key covariates were objectively quantified, including 
physical activity, body mass index, blood pressure, pulmonary 
function, and renal function, others were self-reported, includ-
ing heart disease, smoking, and diabetes mellitus.

Notwithstanding these limitations, these data show that 
greater sleep fragmentation is associated with more arte-
riolosclerosis and macroscopic subcortical infarct pathology. 
Further work is needed to clarify whether these are conse-
quences or causes of sleep fragmentation, the role of specific 
contributors to sleep fragmentation (eg, sleep apnea), and 
underlying biological mechanisms.
