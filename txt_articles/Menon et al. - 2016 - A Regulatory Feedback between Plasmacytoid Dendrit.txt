In Brief
The signals required for Breg cell
differentiation in humans are currently
unknown. Mauri and colleagues show
that plasmacytoid dendritic cells, via the
provision of IFN-a, govern the
differentiation of immature B cells into
regulatory B cells that restrain
inflammation.

SUMMARY
Signals controlling the generation of regulatory B
(Breg) cells remain ill-defined. Here we report an
‘‘auto’’-regulatory feedback mechanism between
plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) and Breg cells.
In healthy individuals, pDCs drive the differentia-
tion
of
CD19+CD24hiCD38hi
(immature)
B
cells
into IL-10-producing CD24+CD38hi Breg cells and
plasmablasts, via the release of IFN-a and CD40
engagement. CD24+CD38hi Breg cells conversely
restrained IFN-a production by pDCs via IL-10
release. In systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE),
this cross-talk was compromised; pDCs promoted
plasmablast differentiation but failed to induce
Breg cells. This defect was recapitulated in healthy
B cells upon exposure to a high concentration
of IFN-a. Defective pDC-mediated expansion of
CD24+CD38hi Breg cell numbers in SLE was associ-
ated with altered STAT1 and STAT3 activation.
Both altered pDC-CD24+CD38hi Breg cell inter-
actions and STAT1-STAT3 activation were normal-
ized in SLE patients responding to rituximab. We
propose that alteration in pDC-CD24+CD38hi Breg
cell interaction contributes to the pathogenesis
of SLE.
INTRODUCTION
Regulatory B (Breg) cells exhibit immunosuppressive functions
via the release of IL-10, transforming growth factor (TGF)-b,
and IL-35 and by induction of other regulatory cells (Mauri and
Bosma, 2012; Mauri and Nistala, 2014). In healthy individuals,
immature B cells have been shown to regulate T cell responses
via the release of IL-10, suppressing T helper 1 (Th1) and Th17
cell differentiation, and by converting effector CD4+ T cells into
FoxP3+CD4+ regulatory T (Treg) cells (Blair et al., 2010; Flores-
Borja et al., 2013). In several autoimmune diseases, including
SLE and rheumatoid arthritis (RA), Breg cells are functionally
and numerically impaired (Blair et al., 2010; Flores-Borja et al.,
2013). Signals required for the differentiation of human Breg cells
remain poorly understood.
CD123+BDCA-2+ plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) are
important drivers of innate and adaptive immune responses
(McKenna et al., 2005; Reizis et al., 2011). pDCs rapidly produce
large amounts of interferon alpha (IFN-a) upon toll-like receptor
(TLR) activation during viral infections or in response to neutro-
phil extracellular traps (NETs) (Gilliet et al., 2008; Hoffmann
et al., 2015; Garcia-Romo et al., 2011; Swiecki and Colonna,
2015). In SLE, neutrophils die upon exposure to SLE-derived
anti-ribonucleoprotein antibodies and release NETs containing
endogenous DNA as well as neutrophil proteins that enter pDC
endocytic compartments and activate them to produce high
amounts of IFN-a (Garcia-Romo et al., 2011; Lande et al.,
2011). IFN-a stimulates multiple cell types, including natural killer
(NK) cells, monocytes, myeloid DCs, and T cells, to release a
variety of pro-inflammatory cytokines (McKenna et al., 2005).
IFN-a produced by pDCs is pivotal in driving the maturation
of B cells into plasmablasts (Jego et al., 2003; Poeck et al.,
2004). pDCs can induce the differentiation of IL-10-producing
T cells and FoxP3+ Treg cells to counterbalance inflammatory
responses and to prevent excess inflammation (Ito et al., 2007;
Moseman et al., 2004; Swiecki and Colonna, 2015).
IFN-a-induced gene signature, together with defects in B cell
function, is considered the hallmark of SLE (Bennett et al.,
2003; Obermoser and Pascual, 2010). In SLE, chronic activation
of pDCs and other cells results in enhanced IFN-a and IFN-a/b
receptor (IFN-a/bR) signaling on target cells (Ro
¨ nnblom and Elor-
anta, 2013). Higher amounts of IFN-a production in SLE are
associated with an accumulation of plasma cells, increased
autoantibody, defective apoptotic cell clearance, and promotion
of T-cell-dependent inflammation (Li et al., 2015; Pascual et al.,
2006). In lupus-prone transgenic mice, transient depletion of
pDCs prior to disease initiation reduces autoantibody, type
I IFN signature, and kidney pathology compared to undepleted
mice (Rowland et al., 2014). Similarly, IFN-a/bR blockade inhibits
autoantibody production and protects young lupus-prone BXSB
or MRL-Faslpr mice from disease, highlighting a role for pDCs
in the disease initiation (Baccala et al., 2012). Furthermore,
IRF8-deficient NZB mice, which lack pDCs, display a profound
reduction in anti-nuclear, anti-chromatin, and anti-erythrocyte
autoantibodies, as well as a significant reduction in kidney
disease (Baccala et al., 2013). In addition, mice lacking E2-2, a
transcription factor that regulates pDC development, display
impaired pDC function, a dramatic reduction in anti-DNA auto-
antibody production, and glomerulonephritis as well as amelio-
rated disease (Sisirak et al., 2014).

 Several studies have linked type I IFNs with an increase in IL-
10 production by B cells (Matsumoto et al., 2014; Schubert et al.,
2015). However, the role of pDCs and/or type I IFNs in deter-
mining whether a B cell becomes a Breg cell or an antibody-pro-
ducing plasmablast remains unknown. Our data demonstrate
that pDCs can generate plasmablasts that co-express IL-10,
IL-6, and TNF-a and release antibody, as well as CD24+CD38hi
Breg cells. CD24+CD38hi Breg cells provided negative feedback
and restrained excessive IFN-a production by pDCs via IL-10
release. In SLE, pDCs failed to induce the differentiation of
CD24+CD38hi Breg cells but promoted antibody production.
Similarly, in vitro stimulation of healthy B cells with high concen-
trations of IFN-a failed to expand CD24+CD38hi Breg cells but
promoted plasmablast differentiation. In comparison to healthy
controls, immature B cells from SLE patients displayed altered
STAT1 and STAT3 activation and expressed higher amounts of
TNF-a and IL-6 than IL-10. Of note, newly repopulated immature
B cells in SLE patients responding to rituximab showed normal-
ized expression of STAT1 and STAT3 and could differentiate into
CD24+CD38hi Breg cells.
RESULTS
pDCs Expand CD24+CD38hi Breg Cells in Healthy
Individuals
To test whether pDCs could generate Breg cells, as well as
plasma cells as previously reported (Jego et al., 2003), we co-
cultured negatively isolated healthy B cells with autologous
pDCs for 3 days with CpGC, a TLR9 agonist that stimulates
both pDCs and B cells (Hartmann et al., 2003). Figures S1A
and S1B show the purity of isolated B cells and pDCs. In addition
to inducing the differentiation of CD24�CD38hi B cells (plasma-
blasts), stimulation with pDCs and CpGC induced an expansion
of CD24+CD38hi B cells (Figure 1A) (comprising CD24hiCD38hi
and CD24intCD38hi B cells as shown in Figure S1C). Of note,
both CD24hiCD38hi and CD24intCD38hi B cells were IgMhi, IgDhi,
and CD27�, characteristic of B cells at an immature stage of
development (Figures S1D). Further phenotypical analysis
confirmed that the pDC-expanded plasmablasts were CD27+,
IgD�, and IgMlo, whereas pDC-expanded CD24+CD38hi B cells
were also CD27�, IgDhi, and IgMhi (Figure 1B).
In addition to expanding B cells with an immature phenotype
that has previously been associated with Breg cells (Blair et al.,
2010), pDCs induced a 4-fold enrichment of IL-10-producing
B cells compared to B cells stimulated with CpGC alone (Fig-
ure 1C). An expansion of IL-10-producing B cell numbers was
observed even at low ratios (up to 1:50 pDCs:B cells) (Fig-
ure S1E). Analysis of the co-culture supernatants confirmed
significantly increased amounts of IL-10 (Figure 1D). IL-10+
B cells generated by pDCs expressed higher Ki67 than IL-10+
B cells generated on stimulation with CpGC alone (Figure S1F).
The majority of IL-10+ B cells induced by pDCs were CD24+
CD38hi B cells, with a smaller percentage residing within the
plasmablast population, also previously ascribed with regulatory
capacity (Figure 1E; Matsumoto et al., 2014). The majority of IL-
10+ B cells were CD27�CD38hi B cells, with a smaller percentage
found within the CD27+CD38hi population (Figure S1G). CpGC-
stimulated pDCs displayed an enhanced ability to expand
IL-10+ B cells compared to anti-CD3-stimulated CD4+ T cells,
R848-stimulated monocytes, or poly(I:C)-stimulated BDCA-3+
conventional DCs (cDCs), all of which only marginally expanded
IL-10+ B cells (Figures S2A–S2D).
To confirm that pDCs induce the differentiation of B cells with
suppressive capacity, B cells were cultured alone with CpGC or
with pDCs and CpGC for 48 hr. B cells were then re-isolated and
co-cultured with autologous anti-CD3-stimulated CD4+CD25�
T cells for 72 hr. Whereas B cells re-isolated from pDC-B cell
co-cultures
suppressed
the
differentiation
of
IFN-g+CD4+
T cells and TNF-a+CD4+ T cells, B cells re-isolated after culture
with CpGC alone were unable to inhibit the differentiation of
IFN-g+ or TNF-a+CD4+ T cells (Figure 1F). Thus, TLR9-activated
pDCs expand the frequency of suppressive IL-10+CD24+CD38hi
B cells and to lesser extent IL-10+CD24�CD38hi B cells.
Immature B Cells Are the Precursors of pDC-Induced
Breg Cells
Next, we investigated whether the pDC-expanded CD24+CD38hi
Breg cells were derived directly from immature B cells or whether
pDCs upregulated the expression of CD24 and CD38 on mature
and memory B cells. CD24hiCD38hi (immature), CD24intCD38int
(mature), and CD24hiCD38� (memory) B cells were sorted by
flow cytometry and stimulated with both CpGC and pDCs or
with CpGC alone for 3 days (the purity of sorted B cell subsets
is shown in Figure S3A). pDC-stimulated immature B cells pro-
duced significantly higher amounts of IL-10 compared to mature
and memory B cells. Mature and memory B cells did not signif-
icantly upregulate IL-10 after co-culture with pDCs (Figures 2A
and 2B). In response to CpGC and pDCs, CD24intCD38int and
CD24+CD38� B cells preferentially differentiated into plasma-
blasts (Figure S3B), whereas immature B cells differentiated
into CD24+CD38hi and CD24�CD38hi B cells (Figure 2C). Enrich-
ment in IL-10-producing B cells was noted in both subsets after
culture with CpG and pDCs (Figure 2D). Immature B cell-derived
CD24+CD38hi B cells were Blimp1�Pax5+IgDhiIgMhi, whereas
plasmablasts were IgMloIgD�Pax5loBlimp1+ (Figure S3C), and
IL-10+CD24+CD38hi
Breg
cells
were

 whereas IL-10+ plasmablasts were Blimp1+Pax5loCD27+ (Fig-
ure 2E). Of interest, a similar effect of pDCs on CD24+CD38hi
Breg cells and IL-10 production was also observed when human
cytomegalovirus (HCMV) lysates were used instead of CpGC
(Figures S3D and S3E). These findings demonstrate that imma-
ture B cells are the direct precursors of pDC-induced CD24+
CD38hi Breg cells and plasmablasts expressing IL-10.
To investigate whether pDC-generated CD24+CD38hi and
CD24�CD38hi B cells could both exhibit regulatory function,
both B cell subsets were purified from the pDC:immature B cell
co-culture and then co-cultured with anti-CD3 CD4+CD25�
T cells. Whereas CD24+CD38hi B cells inhibited the differentiation
of TNF-a+CD4+ T cells, CD24�CD38+ plasmablasts showed a
negligible suppressive effect (Figure S3F). Plasmablasts purified
from co-cultures of mature or memory B cells with pDCs did
not show any suppressive effect (data not shown). Next, we
measured whether pDC-generated CD24+CD38hi B cells and
plasmablasts expressed other cytokines. We observed that the
vast majority of pDC-generated CD24+CD38hi B cells expressed
only IL-10(Figures 2F and 2G); however, pDC-generated plasma-
blasts comprised similar proportions of IL-10, TNF-a, or IL-6
single expressing cells and TNF-a+IL-10 or IL-6+IL-10 co-ex-
pressing cells (Figures 2F and 2G). No IL-17, IFN-g, IL-1b, IL-2,
IL-23, or IL-21 was detected by intracellular staining in the
pDC-generated CD24+CD38hi B cells (Figure S3G).

 (Siegal et al., 1999), the supernatants from CpGC-stimulated
pDCs showed an abundance of IFN-a over other cytokines (Fig-
ure 3A). Neutralization of IFN-a and IFNa/bR2 (IFNR2) in pDC-B
cell co-cultures resulted in a significant reduction in the fre-
quency of IL-10+ B cells and IL-10+CD24+CD38hi B cells and
in the amount of IL-10 detected in the supernatants (Figures
3B–3D). Addition of exogenous IFN-a, IFN-b, or supernatants
collected from CpGC-stimulated pDCs to TLR9-activated B cells
resulted in an expansion of IL-10-producing CD24+CD38hi Breg
cells (Figures S4A–S4E).
CpGA and CpGB have been previously reported to differen-
tially activate pDCs: CpGA stimulates pDCs to release IFN-a
whereas CpGB induces the maturation of pDCs with minimal
IFN-a production (Kerkmann et al., 2003). This provided us
with a useful tool to test whether IFN-a produced by CpG-acti-
vated pDCs is necessary for B cell IL-10 production. pDCs
were activated with CpGA or CpGB, washed, and then co-
cultured with CpGB pre-activated B cells. pDCs and B cells
stimulated with CpGC were used as a control. The results
show that activation of pDCs with CpGA but not CpGB signifi-
cantly expanded IL-10-producing B cells (Figure S4F).
CD24hiCD38hi B cells have been reported to require CD40 sig-
nals to produce IL-10 (Blair et al., 2010). Expression of CD154
(CD40L) on pDCs was upregulated after CpGC stimulation (Fig-
ure 3E). Addition of anti-CD40L mAb to pDC-B cell co-cultures
resulted in partial reduction of CD24+CD38hi Breg cells, whereas
simultaneous neutralization of IFN-a/IFN-R2 and CD40L further
decreased CD24+CD38hi Breg cell generation (Figure 3F). Block-
ing BAFF receptor in the pDC-B cell co-cultures had no effect on
the differentiation of IL-10+ B cells. IL-10+ B cell induction was
also independent of PD-1-PD-L1 or -PD-L2 interactions (Figures
S4G–S4J), reported to be important in the differentiation of Treg
cells (Francisco et al., 2009).
pDC Activation Inversely Correlates with CD24+CD38hi
Breg Cell Frequency
Previous studies have reported that an elevated IFN-I gene
signature correlates with disease severity (Bennett et al., 2003;
Feng et al., 2006; Obermoser and Pascual, 2010). We also
observed that SLE patients with active disease (BILAG > 8)
displayed an elevated IFN-I signature measured by the expres-
sion of MX1, MCL1, and IRF9, compared to patients with inactive
disease (BILAG < 8) and healthy individuals (Figures 4A). pDCs
from active SLE patients displayed higher relative expression
of IFNA1 and IRF7, a transcription factor known to play a critical
role in the induction of type I IFN (Honda et al., 2005), as well as
IL6 and IL12B, but not IL12A, compared to healthy individuals
(Figure S5A). A significant increase in the amount of IFN-a
was also detected in supernatants of CpGA-stimulated PBMCs
from active SLE patients compared to healthy individuals
(Figure S5B).
If pDCs induce CD24+CD38hi Breg cells via IFN-a, then why
are CD24+CD38hi Breg cells reduced in SLE despite the pres-
ence of chronically activated pDCs and a type I IFN signature?
To address this, we assessed whether there was a link between
CD24+CD38hi Breg cell frequency and the activation of pDCs
ex vivo in SLE patients. Unlike previous studies showing a nu-
merical deficiency in the number of pDCs (Blanco et al., 2001;
Cederblad et al., 1998), the frequency of pDCs was unchanged
in our cohort of patients (Figure 4B). The percentages of pDCs
expressing Ki67, CD86, and CD80, hallmarks of TLR-induced
pDC activation (McKenna et al., 2005), were significantly
increased in SLE patients with active disease compared to inac-
tive patients or healthy controls (Figures 4B–4E). Ex vivo expres-
sion of CD83, a DC maturation marker (Lechmann et al., 2002),
was undetectable in pDCs (data not shown). In addition, CD24+
CD38hi Breg cell frequency inversely correlated with disease
severity (Figures 4F), as well as with pDC activation status,
measured by CD80 and CD86 expression, in active and inactive
patients (Figures 4G and 4H).
SLE patients were also grouped for analysis based on the
expression of the IRF-9 as a marker of an IFN signature. Fig-
ure S5C shows that patients with a higher IFN signature (IFNhi)
have active disease, a higher frequency of activated pDCs
(measured by the expression of CD80 and CD86), and a lower
frequency of CD24+CD38hi Breg cells compared to patients
with a low IFN-gene signature (IFNlo). Similar results were ob-
tained after segregating patients on MX1 and MCL1 expression
levels (data not shown). Disease activity definitions and patient
information are given in Table S1.
SLE pDCs Failed to Promote Differentiation of
CD24+CD38hi Breg Cells
Next, we investigated the functional outcome of pDC-B cell in-
teractions in SLE patients. Using ImageStream technology, we
visualized multiple pDC-B cell interactions in CpGC-stimulated
PBMCs. No differences were found in the numbers of pDC-B
cell conjugates in healthy and SLE PBMCs (Figure S6A). How-
ever, although healthy B cells interacting with pDCs expressed
IL-10, SLE B cells interacting with pDCs did not (Figure S6B).
Because patients with SLE are often lymphopenic (Rivero
et al., 1978), we were unable to obtain sufficient pDCs from
SLE PBMCs to assess whether they induce Breg cells in co-cul-
tures with autologous B cells. To circumvent this problem, we
depleted pDCs from healthy or SLE PBMCs and measured the
effect that pDC depletion had on the expansion of IL-10+ B cells
or B cell subsets. (Figure S6C confirms the depletion of pDCs
from PBMCs by flow cytometry sorting.) It is noteworthy that,
although SLE patients displayed lymphopenia, the pDC:B cell
ratios in healthy and SLE PBMCs were comparable (data not
shown). Frequencies of IL-10+ B cells were significantly reduced
in pDC-depleted healthy PBMCs but not in SLE PBMCs (Fig-
ure 5A). However, depletion of pDCs from CpGC-stimulated
healthy and SLE PBMCs resulted in a significant reduction in
the frequency of both CD24+CD38hi B cells and plasmablasts,
compared to undepleted PBMCs (Figure S6D). IgG production
by pDC-depleted PBMCs was decreased in both healthy and
SLE PBMCs, whereas IgM levels were unaffected (Figures S6E
and S6F). Of note, no significant differences were observed in
B cell subset frequencies ex vivo in healthy and SLE PBMCs
(Figure S6G).
Our results suggest that the lack of CD24+CD38hi Breg cell
induction observed in SLE could be the consequence of defec-
tive stimulation by pDCs. To evaluate this, healthy B cells were
co-cultured either with pooled allogeneic healthy pDCs or with
pDCs from SLE patients and stimulated with CpGC, and then
CD24+CD38hi Breg cell induction was assessed by flow cytom-
etry. pDCs from healthy individuals induced a 5-fold expansion

 of CD24+CD38hi Breg cells, whereas less than a 2-fold expan-
sion was induced by SLE pDCs, indicating that pDCs are defec-
tive in SLE (Figure 5B). It is also possible that SLE B cells are re-
fractory to stimulation by pDCs; upon stimulation with CpGC,
healthy pDCs induced a partial increase of CD24+CD38hi Breg
cells from SLE B cells, whereas SLE pDCs failed to induce
CD24+CD38hi Breg cells from SLE B cells (Figure 5B). TLR9
gene expression ex vivo was comparable between healthy and
SLE B cells (Figure S6H). These data suggest that both pDCs
and B cells are defective in patients with SLE.
SLE B Cells Display an Altered Response to IFN-a
Stimulation
To investigate whether in vivo exposure of B cells to high levels
of IFN-a released by chronically activated pDCs could explain
the reduced frequency of IL-10+ B cells in SLE, B cells were
stimulated with CpGC and increasing doses of IFN-a. Healthy
B-cell-derived IL-10 production increased up to 50,000 U/mL
of IFN-a, but at higher concentrations IL-10 production was
significantly reduced (Figure 5C). IFN-a induced only low levels
of IL-10 production from SLE B cells, which did not increase with
higher IFN-a concentrations (Figure 5C). Culture with increasing
IFN-a concentrations, up to 50,000 U/mL, also increased the
frequency of CD24+CD38hi B cells and CD24+CD38hi Breg cells
in healthy, but not in SLE, B cell cultures (Figures S7A and S7B).
In contrast, stimulation of both healthy and SLE B cells with
increasing IFN-a concentrations continued to promote plasma-
blast differentiation, but not their expression of IL-10, even at the
highest concentrations (Figures S7C and S7D).
Engagement of IFN-a/bR by type I IFN results in the recruit-
ment, phosphorylation, and nuclear translocation of signal
transducer and activation of transcription proteins (STATs)
and other transcription factors (Ivashkiv and Donlin, 2014).
In particular, IFN-a/bR signaling results in the recruitment of
IRF9 and STAT1, which are involved in the transcription of
interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) and anti-nuclear antibody
production in a mouse model of SLE (Thibault et al., 2008),
and STAT3, which is involved in the transcription of the IL-10
locus (Benkhart et al., 2000). Ex vivo, the expression of IFR9
and total STAT1 (tSTAT1), but not total STAT3, were signifi-
cantly increased in B cells from SLE patients compared to
healthy controls (Figures 5D–5F). In response to IFN-a, phos-
phorylation
of
STAT3,
but
not
STAT1,
was
significantly
decreased in SLE CD24+CD38hi B cells compared to healthy
CD24+CD38hi B cells (Figures 5G and 5H). No differences be-
tween healthy and SLE were identified in the phosphorylation
of STAT1 or STAT3 in the other B cell subsets (data not shown).
In SLE B cells, these changes in total STAT1 and phosphoryla-
tion of STAT3 were reflected in a reduced frequency of single
IL-10-producing B cells and an increase in the expression of
TNF-a and IL-6, compared to healthy controls after in vitro
stimulation of PBMCs with CpGC to activate pDCs (Figures 5I
and 5J).
Healthy but Not SLE CD24+CD38hi Breg Cells Suppress
pDC-Derived IFN-a via IL-10
IL-10 is known to inhibit pDC-derived IFN-a production in TLR-
activated PBMCs (Duramad et al., 2003). To investigate whether
IL-10+ Breg cells control excessive IFN-a production, we as-
sessed the effect of CD24+CD38hi B cell depletion from healthy
and SLE PBMCs on IFN-a production by pDCs. CD24+CD38hi
B cells were depleted from PBMCs, which were then stimulated
with CpGC for 20 hr (Figure S7E confirms the depletion of
CD24+CD38hi B cells from PBMCs by flow cytometry sorting).
Depletion of CD24+CD38hi B cells from healthy PBMCs resulted
in a 50% increase in IFN-a production whereas depletion of
CD24+CD38hi B cells from SLE PBMCs resulted in only a 10%
increase in IFN-a production (Figure 6A). These results suggest
that CD24+CD38hi B cells control pDC IFN-a production in
healthy individuals but not in SLE patients.
To test whether healthy CD24+CD38hi Breg cells can directly
suppress IFN-a+ pDCs, sorted healthy immature, mature, and
memory B cells were pre-stimulated with soluble CD40L for
48 hr and then cultured with autologous pDCs and CpGA for
20 hr. CD24+CD38hi B cells displayed significantly greater sup-
pression of pDC IFN-a expression than other subsets (Fig-
ure 6B). Culture of CpGA-stimulated pDCs with supernatants
from CD40L-stimulated healthy immature B cells, but not other
subsets, induced a similar degree of suppression of IFN-a (Fig-
ure 6C). Addition of anti-IL-10/IL-10R mAb to pDCs cultured
with supernatants from CD40-activated immature B cells, which
displayed the highest concentration of IL-10, restored IFN-a
expression by pDCs (Figures 6D and 6E).
Because
of
the difficulties
in obtaining
sufficient
pDC
numbers from SLE patients, we could not assess whether SLE
CD24+CD38hi B cells could suppress autologous pDC re-
sponses directly. As an alternative, we compared whether
supernatants isolated from healthy or SLE immature B cells
were able to inhibit IFN-a production by allogeneic healthy
pDCs (Figure 6F). Supernatants from CD40L-stimulated healthy
immature B cells, but not from SLE immature B cells, suppressed
IFN-a production by allogeneic healthy pDCs (Figure 6G). These
results highlight that Breg cells can regulate IFN-a production by
pDCs in healthy individuals but not in SLE patients.
Rituximab Therapy Corrects pDC-Breg Cell Interactions
Patients treated with rituximab after B cell repopulation can
be divided into two groups: those responding to rituximab
(responders) and those not responding to rituximab (non-re-
sponders) therapy (Leandro et al., 2006). We investigated
whether the newly repopulated B cells in responding patients
could differentiate into Breg cells and whether this would be
accompanied by a normalization of pDC function. Newly repo-
pulated B cells in responders expressed IRF9 and tSTAT1
comparable to healthy controls, whereas non-responders dis-
played higher expression of IRF9 and tSTAT1 (Figures 7A
and 7B). No differences were observed in the expression of
tSTAT3 (Figure 7C). Upon stimulation with IFN-a, pSTAT1
expression increased and pSTAT3 decreased in CD24+CD38hi
B cells from non-responders compared to responders and
healthy individuals (Figures 7D and 7E). Restoration of STAT3
phosphorylation
in
responding
patients
was
reflected
by
normalization of the frequency of CD24+CD38hi Breg cells, after
in vitro stimulation of PBMCs with CpGC to activate pDCs. In
contrast, non-responding patients showed an increase in
expression of TNF-a and IL-6 and a reduction in CD24+CD38hi
Breg cells, compared to healthy controls and responders (Fig-
ures 7F and 7G).

 In responding patients, the restoration of CD24+CD38hi Breg
cell function corresponded to a decrease in the activation of
pDCs, as measured by CD80 and CD86 expression. In non-re-
sponding patients, the pDCs retained an activated phenotype
(Figures 7H and 7I). Responders showed levels of Breg cells
and pDC activation closer to healthy controls than non-re-
sponders (Figures 7J and 7K). In vitro depletion of pDCs from
PBMCs of responders reduced the differentiation of IL-10+ B
cells compared to undepleted PBMCs, indicating that the
pDCs have reacquired the ability to induce CD24+CD38hi Breg
cells in responding patients. In non-responders, depletion of
pDCs from PBMCs had no effect on the expansion of CD24+
CD38hi Breg cells (Figure 7L).
DISCUSSION
Experimental models of autoimmune diseases support a pivotal
role for pro-inflammatory cytokines in the differentiation of Breg
cells (Rosser et al., 2014; Yoshizaki et al., 2012). The effect
that inflammatory stimuli have on the differentiation of human
Breg cells remains unclear. Here we report that TLR9-activated
pDCs directly interact with immature B cells and promote
their differentiation into CD24+CD38hi Breg cells as well as
plasmablasts.
pDCs play a pleiotropic role in the immune system, controlling
both the initiation of pro-inflammatory responses necessary to
clear infection and the differentiation of regulatory cells (Swiecki
and Colonna, 2015). Our data showing that pDCs are pivotal in
the differentiation of CD24+CD38hi Breg cells further strengthen
the multi-functional role of pDCs in linking innate and adaptive
immune responses. The expansion of IL-10-producing B cells
and CD24+CD38hi Breg cells was dependent on the release of
an optimum amount of IFN-a by pDCs. This is in contrast to a
previous study reporting that pDCs promote IL-10 production by
B cells in an IFN-a-independent manner (Georg and Bekered-
jian-Ding, 2012). Discrepancies between the two studies could
be due to the usage of different TLR9 agonists: Georg and Beker-
edjian-Ding (2012) used CpGB, rather than CpGC, to stimulate
pDCs and test the involvement of type I IFN in the pDC-B cell inter-
action. As previously reported, CpGB induces negligible amount
of IFN-a by pDCs and preferentially promotes their maturation
(Kerkmann et al., 2003). The comparison of different TLR9 ago-
nists in our study confirms that activation of pDCs with CpGC,
but not CpGB, significantly expands IL-10-producing B cells via
the release of IFN-a. Different concentrations of exogenous
IFN-a added to B cells might also explain some of the differences
reported. A role for IFN-a in the expansion of IL-10-producing B
cells by pDCs cannot be entirely excluded without neutralization
of IFN-a and IFN-a/bR in the pDC:B cell co-culture and this was
not being tested in the study by Georg and Bekeredjian-Ding
(2012).
Findings in a number of disease settings support a role for IFN-
a-producing pDCs in the differentiation of CD24+CD38hi Breg
cells. In patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infec-
tion, IFN-a measured in the sera correlated with the disease
severity and with increased number of CD24hiCD38hi B cells
in circulation (Malaspina et al., 2006). CD24hiCD38hi Breg cell
enrichment in patients infected with HIV correlated with the viral
load (Siewe et al., 2013). In the same studies, the CD24hiCD38hi
Breg cells suppressed HIV-1-specific CD8+ T cell responses
in an IL-10-dependent manner. Collectively, these results sug-
gest that the IFN-a released by pDCs in response to HIV infec-
tion might promote the expansion of CD24hiCD38hi Breg cells
and the suppression of anti-viral immune response. Further evi-
dence of a role for pDCs and IFN-a in the expansion of CD24+
CD38hi Breg cells is provided by data reporting an enrichment
of IL-10+CD24hiCD38hi B cells in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients
responding to IFN-b therapy (Schubert et al., 2015). In this study,
the authors showed that B-cell-deficient mice are resistant to the
IFN-b therapy, which otherwise treats experimental autoimmune
encephalitis in wild-type mice, suggesting that B cells mediate
the immunosuppressive effects of IFN-b therapy.
We found that the concentration of IFN-a determines whether
an immature B cell develops into a CD24+CD38hi Breg cell or
a plasmablast. At lower concentrations of IFN-a, B cells differ-
entiate into both plasmablasts and CD24+CD38hi Breg cells,
whereas at higher concentrations, the B cell response is chan-
neled toward plasma cell maturation. A similar inhibitory effect
was reported in another study showing that whereas lower
concentrations of IFN-a promote FoxP3 expression, a high con-
centration (100,000 U/mL) inhibits the expression of FoxP3 on
T cells (Shibuya and Hirohata, 2005). Physiologically, the ability
of moderate concentrations of IFN-a to induce both plasma-
blasts and CD24+CD38hi Breg cells might reflect the fact that
an immune response to an infection requires both antibody pro-
duction to eliminate invading pathogens and the generation of
regulatory cells to prevent chronic inflammation. IFN-a-sup-
ported plasmablast and CD24+CD38hi Breg cell generation
might also depend on the integration of other inflammatory sig-
nals, in particular the levels of CD40L expression, or the profile
of cytokines produced over the course of the infection by contig-
uous or interacting cells. The finding that higher concentrations

 of IFN-a favor plasmablast generation might reflect a disease
setting with chronic inflammation. For example, IFN-a overex-
posure might explain the lack of functional CD24+CD38hi
Breg cells, and bias toward anti-nuclear antibody production
and more severe disease, in patients with SLE who have an
‘‘IFN gene signature.’’ In MS patients, IFN-b treatment can
induce the development of thyroid autoimmunity (Frisullo et al.,
2014) and failure to respond to treatment in patients with an ex-
isting ‘‘IFN gene signature’’ (Verweij and Vosslamber, 2013). IFN
therapy in hepatitis C or chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML)
patients can result in lupus-like symptoms (To
´ thova
´ , 2002; Wil-
son et al., 2002). Therefore, it is possible that the induction of
autoimmune-like disease after type I IFN therapy in these cases
might be due to the high concentrations of exogenous type I IFN
favoring plasmablasts over CD24+CD38hi Breg cell generation.
The analysis of CD24+CD38hi B cells from SLE patients
revealed an altered activation of STAT1 and STAT3 upon
IFN-a stimulation, compared to healthy individuals. Among the
cascade of events initiated by the IFN receptor engagement,
phosphorylation of STAT1 induces transcription of pro-inflam-
matory genes, whereas phosphorylation of STAT3 indirectly
suppresses pro-inflammatory gene expression and induces the
transcription of IL-10 (Benkhart et al., 2000; Ivashkiv and Donlin,
2014; Luu et al., 2014). This supports our findings showing
increased amounts of IL-6 and TNF-a and lower amounts of
IL-10, after stimulation via pDCs in SLE CD24+CD38hi B cells.
Our data suggest that the immune regulatory feedback be-
tween CD24+CD38hi Breg cells and pDCs that is in place
in healthy individuals is dysfunctional in SLE patients but that
this feedback is normalized in patients who respond to rituxi-
mab. It is tempting to suggest that when sufficient CD24+
CD38hi Breg cells have been generated at a site of inflammation
by IFN-a+ pDCs or after CD40-CD40L interactions with T cells,
for instance, Breg cells can then prevent pDCs from producing
excessive IFN-a that would otherwise drive chronic inflamma-
tion. A similar feedback mechanism was previously shown in
neonatal mice, where B cells producing IL-10 control the inflam-
matory response mounted by pDCs after the systemic adminis-
tration of a TLR-9 agonist (Zhang et al., 2007). However, in
contrast to our results, this feature was restricted to neonatal
B cells; TLR9 administration exacerbated inflammation in adult
mice. Our data suggest that in adult humans, loss of feedback
between CD24+CD38hi Breg cells and pDCs correlates with
loss of tolerance that was restored in patients responding to rit-
uximab. Thus, in addition to simply depleting pathogenic B cells
and restoring Breg cell number and function, as has been previ-
ously reported (Anolik et al., 2007; Bosma et al., 2012), rituximab
might also normalize CD24+CD38hi Breg cell-pDC interactions,
supporting tolerance. Evaluating rituximab-treated patients in
terms of their CD24+CD38hi Breg cell frequency and pDC activa-
tion together reveals two groups of responders: responders that
look similar to healthy controls and responders who look more
similar to non-responders. It is possible that the responders
whose CD24+CD38hi Breg cell-pDC interactions do not appear
to be normalized by rituximab treatment might be those who
subsequently relapse to active disease.
Here, we report that pDCs control the differentiation of imma-
ture B cells into CD24+CD38hi Breg cells or plasmablasts and
that pDC-induced CD24+CD38hi Breg cells might reciprocally
regulate pDC-derived IFN-a production. We propose that this
crosstalk is disrupted in SLE patients and that rituximab therapy
might work, in part, by resetting the outcome of CD24+CD38hi
Breg cell-pDC interaction. Thus, modulation of the feedback
loop between pDCs and CD24+CD38hi Breg cells could poten-
tially create new opportunities for immune-based therapies.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Patients and Controls
Peripheral blood was obtained from healthy individuals or patients with SLE.
Table S1 provides definition of disease activity and summarizes the character-
istics of the SLE patients. Ethical approval was obtained from the Ethics Com-
mittee of UCLH-National Health Service Trust.
Cell Isolation and Cultures
B cell subsets, CD4+CD25� T cells, CD14+ monocytes, BDCA-3+ cDCs, and
PBMCs depleted of pDCs were sorted on a FACSAria. CD19+ B cells
or BCDA-2+CD123+ pDCs were isolated by magnetic-bead purification with
EasySep enrichment kits (StemCell).
Isolated CD19+ B cells or FACS-sorted B cell subsets were cultured alone
or with BDCA-2+CD123+ pDCs (unless otherwise stated) at 3:1 and stimulated
with 1 mM of CpGC for 3 days. Cytokines were measured by intracellular stain-
ing. Further details about sample source, cell isolation procedures, B cell dif-
ferentiation, and functional assays are included in Supplemental Experimental
Procedures.
Flow Cytometry
See Supplemental Experimental Procedures for the list of antibodies used.
Cells were analyzed on a LSR II (BD Biosciences). Data were analyzed with
FlowJo (Tree Star).
Image Stream
PBMCs were stimulated with CpGC for 6 hr. The cells were stained for surface
expression of CD19 and BDCA-2, fixed, permeabilized, and stained for intra-
cellular IL-10. The sample was processed on an Amnis ImagetreamX Imaging
Flow Cytometer (MERK-Millipore) with a 403 objective. Raw image files were
acquired with INSPIRE software. A compensation matrix was then applied to
the acquired data to correct for spectral overlap followed by data analysis by
IDEAS 5.0 software. A combined Area to Aspect Ratio dot plot was used to
identify doublets, and a gradient RMS for the Brightfield was used to exclude
out of focus cells. Cells were gated as CD19+BDCA-2+ for pDC-B cell conju-
gate identification and assessed for the expression of IL-10.

Cell Signaling
PBMCs were surface stained with CD19, CD24, and CD38 antibodies in ice-
cold PBS for 30 min, then rested for 1 hr in RPMI medium. Cells were stimu-
lated by incubating with 10,000 U/mL exogenous IFN-a (PBL) for 1 or 5 min
and then fixed with formaldehyde for 10 min at 37�C, washed with ice-cold
PBS, and permeabilized with 90% ice-cold methanol for 20 min on ice.
tSTAT1-PE, tSTAT3-AF647, pSTAT1-AF647, and pSTAT3-PE (BD Phosflow)
were added to cells, for 1 hr at 37�C.
