 Fifteen years after the first substantive trial,1 cognitive–behavioural
therapy (CBT) has become the first form of psychotherapy to
achieve widespread acceptance in schizophrenia. In the UK, the
National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) have
now recommended it twice,2,3 the second time for all people with
the disorder. The American Psychiatric Association approved it
‘with moderate clinical confidence’ in 2004 for patients with stable
schizophrenia,4 and more recently the US Schizophrenia Patient
Outcomes Research Team (PORT) have endorsed it for patients
who have persistent psychotic symptoms while receiving adequate
pharmacotherapy.5,6 Other guideline development groups around
the world have followed suit.7
But is this therapeutic optimism justified? Most large,
methodologically
rigorous
trials
of
CBT
have
failed
to
demonstrate a significant advantage at trial end on either
symptomatic or relapse-related measures,8–12 with only two finding
clear evidence of benefit on their primary outcomes.13,14 Instead, the
judgement that CBT is effective rests on a series of meta-analyses,
which have variously concluded that it is promising;15 that it
produces higher rates of improvement in mental state;16 that it
reduces positive symptoms;17 that it has a small but consistent
effect over standard drug treatment;18 that it has beneficial effects
on positive and negative symptoms, mood, functioning and social
anxiety;19 and that it is effective in reducing readmissions to
hospital, duration of admission and symptom severity.3
It is possible for meta-analyses to come to positive conclusions
even when most of the individual studies included had negative
findings (for example Lau et al20). Nevertheless, basing judgements
on meta-analyses requires that their findings should be reliable and
valid, and there are clear indications that this may not always be
the case. Thus, different meta-analyses of the same studies have
had opposite findings, as has been found with mammography
for breast cancer;21 or similar findings can be interpreted differently,
as Streiner22 has argued is at the heart of the controversy over the
effectiveness of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors in depression.
A further problem is that meta-analyses have sometimes been
found not to agree with the findings of subsequent ‘mega trials’
of the same treatment.23,24
One reason why meta-analyses can reach unreliable conclusions
is failure to take into account study quality. In a review of this
issue, Ju
¨ni et al25 concluded that there was ample evidence that
the deficiencies of methodologically weak trials translated into
biased findings in systematic reviews, and argued that the
influence of study quality should be routinely assessed. Only
one of the meta-analyses of CBT for schizophrenia has formally
done this: Wykes et al19 found that a quality score combining
information from different aspects of the design and reporting
of trials did not significantly moderate effect size in their main
meta-analysis of end-of-study positive symptom scores. However,
the use of quality scales is now no longer recommended, since
these often rate aspects of a study that bear little relationship to
known sources of bias, and also because different quality scales
have been found to give different results.25–27 A range of aspects
of study quality were assessed separately by NICE3, but low-
quality studies continued to be included in all meta-analyses
and potential moderating effects were not examined.
A further aspect of study quality relevant to trials of
psychological treatment is whether the therapy is compared with
treatment as usual (TAU) or to a control intervention. The
position usually taken here is that evidence-based psychotherapies
need to demonstrate benefits over and above what can be
attributed to the so-called shared or non-specific effects of

Cognitive–behavioural therapy for the symptoms
of schizophrenia: systematic review and
meta-analysis with examination of potential bias
S. Jauhar, P. J. McKenna, J. Radua, E. Fung, R. Salvador and K. R. Laws
Background
Cognitive–behavioural therapy (CBT) is considered to be
effective for the symptoms of schizophrenia. However, this
view is based mainly on meta-analysis, whose findings can
be influenced by failure to consider sources of bias.
Aims
To conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of the
effectiveness of CBT for schizophrenic symptoms that
includes an examination of potential sources of bias.
Method
Data were pooled from randomised trials providing end-of-
study data on overall, positive and negative symptoms. The
moderating effects of randomisation, masking of outcome
assessments, incompleteness of outcome data and use of a
control intervention were examined. Publication bias was
also investigated.
Results
Pooled effect sizes were 70.33 (95% CI 70.47 to 70.19) in
34 studies of overall symptoms, 70.25 (95% CI 70.37 to
70.13) in 33 studies of positive symptoms and 70.13
(95% CI 70.25 to 70.01) in 34 studies of negative
symptoms. Masking significantly moderated effect size
in the meta-analyses of overall symptoms (effect sizes
70.62 (95% CI 70.88 to 70.35) v. 70.15 (95% CI 70.27
to 70.03), P = 0.001) and positive symptoms (effect sizes
70.57 (95% CI 70.76 to 70.39) v. 70.08 (95% CI 70.18
to 0.03), P50.001). Use of a control intervention did not
moderate effect size in any of the analyses. There was no
consistent evidence of publication bias across different
analyses.
Conclusions
Cognitive–behavioural therapy has a therapeutic effect on
schizophrenic symptoms in the ‘small’ range. This reduces
further when sources of bias, particularly masking, are
controlled for.

Review article
 psychological intervention,28,29 although an alternative view exists
which considers that applying the logic of placebo-controlled trials
to psychotherapy research is flawed.30,31 Bentall,31 for example,
has argued that whereas psychological factors such as warmth,
kindness and the instilling of hope are unwanted complications
that need to be removed from trials of medical treatments, they
are intrinsic elements of all forms of psychotherapy without which
nothing can be expected to happen. Some meta-analyses of CBT
for schizophrenia carried out separate comparisons of CBT v.
TAU and CBT v. other psychological
interventions;3,15,16,18
however, these did not statistically compare the two sets of effect
sizes. The potential importance of this issue has recently been
highlighted by a Cochrane review32 that found no advantage for
CBT compared with other psychosocial treatments – including
those that were categorised as either active or inactive – on a range
of measures including relapse, readmission to hospital and various
measures of mental state and social functioning.
A final problem facing meta-analysis is publication bias, the
fact that trials with positive findings are more likely to be
published than those with negative findings. Publication bias is
typically examined by means of funnel plots, which may show
an absence of small studies with negative findings, and this can
be supplemented by one or more statistical tests for asymmetry.
To date, the only meta-analysis of CBT for schizophrenia to
examine publication bias has been that of Wykes et al:19 they
found that a funnel plot of studies in their meta-analysis of
positive symptoms was reasonably symmetrical, but they did not
assess this further with statistical testing.
Five and four years, respectively, have passed since the two most
recent comprehensive meta-analyses of CBT for schizophrenia by
Wykes et al19 and NICE3. During this time a considerable number
of further studies have been published (for example33–43), including
two with samples of approximately 100 patients in each group.12,14
We therefore conducted an updated meta-analysis of CBT,
specifically with respect to its effect on core schizophrenic
symptoms. We used this data-set to examine the influence of three
well-recognised sources of bias on effect size: randomisation,
masking and completeness of outcome data. We also evaluated
use of a control intervention as a potential moderating factor.
Finally, we tested whether publication bias might be affecting
the findings.
Method
Identification and selection of studies
The review was conducted in accordance with PRISMA guide-
lines.44 Trials of CBT for schizophrenia were searched for using
MEDLINE (1993 to Week 3, March 2013), PsycINFO (1993 until
Week 4, March 2013), Embase (1993 until Week 4, March 2013)
and the Cochrane central register of controlled trials (1993 until
end of March 2013); 1993 being the year of the first published trial
of CBT in schizophrenia. We used the following MeSH headings/
keywords: (a) ‘‘cognitive therapy’’ OR ‘‘cognitive behavioural
therapy’’ OR ‘‘CBT’’; (b) ‘‘schizophrenia’’ OR ‘‘schizoaffective
disorder’’ OR ‘‘psychosis’’ OR ‘‘non affective psychosis’’ OR
‘‘schizo*’’; (c) ‘‘randomised controlled trial’’ OR ‘‘clinical trial’’
(cognitive behavioural therapy or cognitive therapy or CBT) and
(schizophrenia
or
schizo*
or
psychosis)
and
(randomised
controlled trial or clinical trial). Studies in any language were
considered. The search was supplemented by hand searching of
meta-analyses and review articles. The reference lists of all
obtained studies were also checked. This part of the search was
also used to check for trails that potentially could be included that
were carried out prior to 1993. A search for completed but not yet
published trials was also conducted using metaRegister at Current
Controlled Trials (www.controlled-trials.com/mrct) and authors
of any such trials were contacted for details about prospective
publication dates.
We employed broad inclusion criteria similar to those used by
Wykes et al,19 NICE3 and the Cochrane Collaboration.32 Thus,
studies were included if a majority of the patients had a diagnosis
of schizophrenia, schizoaffective or non-affective functional
psychosis, either made clinically or according to diagnostic
criteria. Studies had to include a parallel control group, but this
could be of any type, i.e. waitlist, TAU or an intervention designed
to control for the non-specific effects of psychotherapy (see
below). We only included randomised trials, specifically excluding
those which the authors stated were non-randomised or which
used inappropriate randomisation methods (e.g. allocation by
alternation or by availability of the intervention).27,45
Since the outcome measures were schizophrenic symptoms,
we required a statement that the type of CBT used was directed
to at least one class of symptoms. Such studies were included in
all of the three main meta-analyses of overall symptoms, positive
symptoms and negative symptoms unless they specified that the
CBT was specialised for negative symptoms, in which case they
were only included in that meta-analysis. A small number of
studies used CBT directed specifically to auditory hallucinations
and these were only included in a supplementary meta-analysis
of these and other studies reporting hallucination scores. Studies
that indicated that the type of CBT used was not directed to
schizophrenic symptoms, but was instead adapted for self-
esteem,46 obsessive–compulsive symptoms,47 post-traumatic stress
symptoms,48 anxiety49,50 or suicidality51 were not included in any
of the analyses.
We included studies using both individual and group CBT.
Given that CBT technique varied considerably across the studies,
those that incorporated additional elements of therapy such as
motivational interviewing,36 family engagement,52 behaviour
therapy53 and social skills training42,54 were not excluded. Like
other meta-analyses, however, we did not include studies that
delivered CBT only as part of a prespecified, multicomponent
package of care including several other interventions (sometimes
referred to as integrated treatment or similar).55–61
We included two studies that used acceptance and commitment
therapy, since the authors considered this to be both related to
CBT and directed to psychotic symptoms.41,62 On the same
grounds we included one study where CBT took the form
predominantly of coping skills enhancement.63 In recognition of
the
uncertainties
about
these
therapies,
however,
we
also
calculated pooled effect sizes excluding these three studies.
Data extraction
Data were initially extracted by two of the authors working
together, and were then independently re-extracted by another
author, with differences being resolved. Effect sizes were calculated
using Hedges’ g, (i.e. the standardised difference between means,
corrected for the tendency towards overestimation in small
studies). When a study used two control groups the effect size
for CBTwas calculated against both of these combined. When data
could not be extracted from information given in the article,
sometimes it was available on the National Collaborating Centre
for Mental Health website (www.nccmh.org.uk), the body which
carries out meta-analyses on behalf of NICE. If the data still
could not be found, authors were contacted. Data were pooled
using Comprehensive Meta-analysis, version 2 for Windows
(www. meta-analysis.com). The random effects option was used
21
Cognitive–behavioural therapy for the symptoms of schizophrenia
 Jauhar et al
in all analyses. Heterogeneity was examined by means of Q and I2
statistics.
Overall symptoms
For the analysis of overall symptoms we included studies
reporting total scores on general psychiatric scales that rated not
just positive and negative symptoms but also other symptoms.
Scales used included the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale
(PANSS),
the
Brief
Psychiatric
Rating
Scale
(BPRS),
the
Comprehensive Psychopathology Rating Scale (CPRS) and the
Hopkins
Psychiatric
Rating
Scale.
Some
studies
separately
reported PANSS positive, negative and general psychopathology
subscale scores. In these cases we calculated the total score as
the sum of the three subscale scores, taking into account the
correlation coefficients between them as reported by Peralta &
Cuesta64 in a sample of 100 patients with DSM-III-R schizophrenia
(see online Data Supplement 1). We did not average scores from
studies that only reported positive and negative symptom scores.
Positive symptoms
For the positive symptoms analysis we included studies that
reported scores for delusions and hallucination subscales of
published scales (i.e. the reality distortion syndrome) or for
delusions, hallucinations and formal thought disorder subscales
(i.e. the older, broader concept of positive symptoms). Scales used
included positive symptom subscales of the PANSS, BPRS, the
Krawiecka (Manchester) scale, the Schedule for the Assessment
of Positive Symptoms (SAPS) and the Psychotic Symptom Rating
Scales (PSYRATS). We did not include the change subscale of the
CPRS, as this does not approximate very closely to positive
psychotic symptoms. If a study reported separate measures of
reality
distortion
and
disorganisation,
these
were
summed
assuming a correlation of 0.40 between the two syndromes, as
reported in a meta-analytic factor analysis of schizophrenic
syndromes by Smith et al.65 Similarly, if a study provided separate
delusion and hallucination subscale scores, these were averaged
assuming a correlation of 0.34 from Smith et al.65
Negative symptoms
Scales used by the studies in this analysis included negative
symptom subscale of the PANSS, the SANS, the BPRS negative
factor, a negative symptoms scale derived from the CPRS and
from the Krawiecka (Manchester) scale. For one study that did
not report global negative symptom scores40 we averaged scores
from
the
four
subscales
of
the
SANS
employed,
using
correlations reported in Smith et al.65 Another study used factor
scores from the SANS,42 and these were also averaged using
published data concerning the correlations between them.66
Hallucinations
Most studies used the hallucinations scale from the PSYRATS; one
study used a single item from the BPRS and another summed
scores from four items from the CPRS. When studies reported
individual PSYRATS hallucination subscale scores, these were
averaged based on the correlations among them in a study of
276 patients with psychosis.67
Examination of potential biasing factors in studies
We examined three sources of bias: randomisation, masking and
incompleteness of outcome data. Bias from randomisation can
be further divided into two distinct processes: (a) sequence
generation, i.e. whether the method for allocating participants
to interventions was based on some explicitly random process;
and (b) allocation concealment, i.e. the demonstration that steps
were taken to prevent the investigators gaining knowledge of
forthcoming allocations. Studies were classified as being at
low risk, at high risk or unclear using the Cochrane Risk of
Bias Tool27,68 (see online Table DS1 for individual studies’
categorisations). Studies at high and low risk of bias were
compared statistically if there were enough studies to do so. If
not, low-risk studies were entered in a subanalysis of studies at
low risk of bias from all three factors. Once again random
effects models were used.
Randomisation (sequence generation)
We considered at low risk of bias studies that described use of
random number tables, a random number generator, coin toss
or drawing lots. Statements about block randomisation and/or
stratification (within a centre), use of an independent statistician
or independent service were also accepted, on the grounds that
these strongly imply use of random numbers. Studies that merely
stated that they used randomisation without further details were
classified as unclear. Since we excluded a priori non-randomised
trials, most studies that would have been classified as at high risk
of bias were automatically removed from consideration. The only
exception was an included study where a subset of the patients
were assigned using inadequate randomisation.69
Randomisation (allocation concealment)
We accepted as evidence of central allocation (one indicator of
effective allocation concealment) any statement that indicated that
randomisation was performed by an outside service or a person
independent of the research team. If randomisation was carried
out by a member of the research team, we required an explicit
statement that he/she was independent or had no involvement
in the baseline assessments. If studies only referred to use of
envelopes, but did not state that they were sequentially numbered,
opaque and sealed, they were categorised as unclear.
Masking
Since no studies of CBT have used double-blinding, only masking
of the outcome assessment was examined. To be categorised as at
low risk of bias, we required the study to state that the assessments
were carried out by interviewers masked to treatment assignment.
Studies that made no statement about masking were treated as at
high risk of bias, on the grounds that it is unlikely that authors
would fail to mention such a key methodological factor if they
had employed it. Studies that referred to independent assessors
without further elaboration were considered as unclear and
authors were contacted. Four studies that indicated that the
masking could have been compromised14,38,70,71 were also rated
as unclear.
Incomplete outcome data
If no further details were given, we used a cut-off of 420%
attrition in the whole sample as the threshold for considering a
study to be at high risk of bias. Studies with attrition rates above
this threshold were still considered as low risk if either (a) details
of individuals who dropped out were given and were justifiable, or
(b) if studies used intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis. Some studies
used ITT, but data could only be extracted from tables that
reported data for those who completed the study. In these cases,
the study was categorised as being at low risk of bias if the
22
 Cognitive–behavioural therapy for the symptoms of schizophrenia
drop-out rate was 520% (without reasons) and ‘unclear’ if the
rate was 420% (without reasons).
Effect of the use of a control intervention
The aim here was to examine the influence of the use of an
intervention designed to control for the non-specific effects of
psychotherapy. To this end we compared studies that employed
control interventions that (a) were stated or implied to control
for this (recreation and support, group support, befriending,
supportive counselling/therapy, social activity therapy and goal-
focused supportive contact); or (b) could be considered unlikely
to have a specific effect on schizophrenic symptoms (psycho-
education and cognitive remediation therapy). We did not include
the family therapy arm of one study (which the authors
considered to be potentially therapeutic).11 Studies where we
combined data from two control groups (i.e. control intervention
and TAU)9,69,72,73 were not included in this analysis.
Publication bias
This was examined using three statistical techniques, Duval &
Tweedie’s74 trim and fill, Begg & Mazumdar’s75 rank correlation
test and Egger’s76 test of the intercept.
Results
The search produced 1246 articles. Titles and, where relevant,
abstracts were checked by two of the authors, leading to 1169
being eliminated. The full text of the 77 remaining studies plus
13 more added from further searching were examined. Fifty
articles reporting 52 studies were finally included (two studies
reported on two separate samples)1,8–14,33–43,52–54,62,63,69–73,77–97
A flow chart of the selection process is shown in Fig. 1. Individual
effect sizes extracted from the included studies plus a list of the
excluded studies are given in online Table DS1 and Data
Supplement 2.
Pooled effect sizes
The pooled effect size for 34 studies of overall symptoms was
70.33 (95% CI 70.47 to 70.19, P50.001) (negative sign
favours CBT). The studies were heterogeneous (Q = 102.71,
P50.001), with an I 2 value of 67.9 (95% CI 54.2–77.5), indicating
that two-thirds of the variation among studies was as a result of
heterogeneity rather than chance. The pooled effect size for 33
studies of positive symptoms was 70.25 (95% CI 70.37 to
70.13, P50.001). Once again the studies were heterogeneous
(Q = 63.12, P= 0.001; I 2 = 49.3, 95% CI 24.1–66.1). The pooled
effect size for 34 studies of negative symptoms was 70.13 (95%
CI 70.25 to 70.01, P= 0.03). These studies were also hetero-
geneous (Q = 63.11, P= 0.001; I 2 = 47.7, 95% CI 21.9–65.0).
Forest plots of the studies in the meta-analysis of overall
symptoms and positive symptoms are shown in Figs 2 and 3
(see online Figs DS1 and DS2 for those for negative symptoms
and hallucinations).
Recalculating the pooled effect sizes excluding studies using
coping strategy enhancement or acceptance and commitment
therapy made little difference to the findings (overall symptoms:
effect size 70.33 (95% CI 70.48 to 70.19, P50.001, 32 studies);
positive symptoms: effect size 70.24 (95% CI 70.36 to 70.11,
P50.001, 30 studies); negative symptoms: 70.14 (95% CI
70.26 to 70.01, P= 0.04, 31 studies).
There were 15 studies in the supplementary meta-analysis of
hallucinations. The pooled effect size was 70.34 (95% CI
70.61 to 70.06, P= 0.01). These studies were heterogeneous
(Q = 46.02, P50.001) with I 2 = 69.6 (95% CI 48.3–82.1).
Examination of bias within studies
The findings with respect to sequence generation, allocation
concealment, masking and completeness of outcome data are
summarised in Table 1. It can be seen that masking significantly
moderated effect size for overall symptoms (70.62 in 10
non-masked
studies
v.
70.15
in
20
masked
studies,
P = 0.001) and positive symptoms (70.57 in 8 non-masked
studies v. 70.08 in 21 masked studies, P50.001). The effect for
negative symptoms was not significant (70.22 in 8 non-masked
studies v. 70.04 in 22 masked studies, P= 0.26).
Only a few studies were considered to be at high risk of bias
with respect to sequence generation, allocation concealment and
incompleteness of outcome data (1–2 studies across all analyses)
and so statistical analysis was not carried out. Instead, studies at
low risk of bias from all three factors (i.e. high-risk studies plus
those categorised as ‘unclear’), were entered into a subanalysis
including only these studies. Pooled effect sizes were as follows:
overall symptoms 70.15 (95% CI 70.32 to 0.01, P= 0.07, 8
studies); positive symptoms 70.10 (95% CI 70.28 to 0.09,
P = 0.30, 9 studies); negative symptoms 70.02 (95% CI 70.15
to 0.11, P= 0.76, 11 studies).
In the supplementary meta-analysis of hallucinations, there
was a large difference between masked and non-masked studies
(effect size 70.18 (95% CI 70.37 to 0.01) in 12 masked studies
v. 70.91 (95% CI 72.67 to 0.85) in 2 non-masked studies),
but statistical significance was not tested owing to the small
number of non-masked studies. No studies were rated as being at
high risk of bias for sequence generation or allocation concealment
and only one study for incompleteness of outcome data. The pooled
effect size for 10 studies at low risk of bias from all three variables
was 70.20 (95% CI 70.44 to 0.04, P= 0.10).

Effect of use of a control intervention
Effect sizes for studies that did and did not use a control inter-
vention in the three main analyses are shown in Table 2. This factor
did not significantly moderate effect size in any of the analyses.
In the meta-analysis of hallucinations, the pooled effect size
was smaller in five studies using a control intervention than in
eight studies that did not, but once again the difference was not
significant (effect size 70.15 (95% CI 70.54 to 0.24) v. 70.55
(95% CI 71.04 to 70.06), Q(B) = 1.58, P= 0.21).
Examination of publication bias
Funnel plots of the studies in the three main analyses are shown in
Fig. 4, and results of the statistical analyses are shown in Table 3.
Trim and fill only imputed studies in the meta-analysis of positive
symptoms (one study), reducing the effect size minimally from
70.25 to 70.24. Begg & Mazumdar’s test was at trend level,
but Egger’s test was not significant. Begg & Mazumdar’s test was
significant in the meta-analyses of overall symptoms and negative
symptoms, at P = 0.009 and 0.02 respectively. Egger’s test was at
trend level in the meta-analysis of overall symptoms (P = 0.06)
and was not significant in the meta-analysis of negative symptoms
(P = 0.30).
Discussion
Main findings
This meta-analysis, which employed broad inclusion criteria
similar to those used by Wykes et al,19 NICE3 and the Cochrane
Collaboration,32 found that pooled effect sizes were in the ‘small’
range for all the classes of symptoms considered. Other recent
meta-analyses have struggled to demonstrate levels of effectiveness
against symptoms higher than this. Thus, Zimmerman et al17
found a pooled effect size of 70.37 for positive symptoms at
the end of treatment, but they only included 15 studies. Wykes
et al19 also found a pooled effect size of 70.37 for positive
symptoms in a larger set of 32 studies, plus an effect size of
70.44 for negative symptoms in 23 studies. However, they used
Glass’s method of calculating effect size, which divides the
difference in means by the standard deviation of the control group
alone rather than the combined standard deviation of both
groups; it is known that this can inflate the estimate of effect
size.98 Although NICE3 concluded that ‘CBT was shown to be
effective in reducing symptom severity as measured by total scores
on items such as the PANSS and BPRS . . . at end of treatment’, the
effect sizes for total symptom scores were 70.27 in 13 studies
comparing CBT with standard care and 70.13 (a non-significant
value) in 6 studies comparing it with ‘other active treatments’. The
corresponding effect sizes for positive symptoms were 70.17
(eight studies) and 70.13 (six studies).
The influences of sources of bias
The importance of masking in trials of psychological treatments is
recognised, even though less attention often seems to be paid to it
than to other aspects of methodology.28,29 Nevertheless, its
moderating effects have only previously been examined twice.
Zimmerman et al17 found effect sizes of 70.29 and 70.54 in
studies with and without masked assessment in their meta-analysis
of 15 studies of positive symptoms, but the difference was not
significant. Wykes et al19 found values of 70.31 in 14 masked
studies compared with 70.49 in 10 non-masked studies; they
did not state whether this represented a significant difference.
Our meta-analysis of a larger set of studies found considerably

larger differences – four to seven times across the three main
meta- analyses – suggesting an exaggeration of the treatment effect
that is at least as great as the 17–36% found in trials of medical
treatments.99–101 In this respect it is worth noting that, in the forest
plots shown in Figs 2 and 3, only two studies published since 2008
(the cut-off year in the NICE3 meta-analysis) have found a
significant advantage for CBT against overall symptoms,94,96 and
only one for positive symptoms.14 The assessments in the first two
of these studies were presumptively made non-masked (the authors
did not comment on masking), and in the third the masking was
found to have become progressively more compromised as the
trial went on.
Statistical examination of the effects of bias from inadequate
randomisation and incompleteness of outcome data was not
possible because of the small numbers of studies classified as being
at high risk. Nevertheless, restriction of the sample to studies
considered to be at low risk of bias from all three sources reduced
the pooled effect sizes to non-significance for all classes of symptom.
These pooled effect sizes may not be reliable, since the numbers of
studies that survived this procedure were quite small (this was due
to large numbers of studies being classified as ‘unclear’). However,
such a finding does arguably place an onus on advocates of CBT
for schizophrenia to demonstrate its effectiveness in at least one large
trial free of the above methodological weaknesses.
Surprisingly, given the universal agreement on the importance
of using a placebo in trials of medical treatments, we found that
use of a control for the non-specific effects of psychological
intervention did not moderate effect size in any of the analyses.
One explanation of this finding could simply be that there were
not enough studies using control interventions (9–12 in the three
main analyses) to detect an effect. There is a possible hint that this
may be the case, in that the pooled effect sizes for studies using a
control intervention were found to be non-significant in all the
three main analyses. But clearly, more studies will be needed to
decide this issue.
Other explanations of our null finding here are also possible,
notably that it supports the argument of authors like Kirsch30
and Bentall,31 that pill placebo and control for the non-specific
effects of psychotherapy are not equatable. As described in the
introduction, this position
is based mainly on theoretical
arguments and neither author attempted to tackle an important
practical consideration, that of the Hawthorne effect.102 This is
the well-established finding that people singled out for almost
any kind of intervention tend to improve their performance or
behaviour simply by virtue of the special attention they receive;
it seems unlikely that this would not happen in psychotherapy
trials. Apart from this, variations in the degree of ‘therapeuticness’
among different control interventions almost certainly needs to be
considered. We were quite restrictive in our approach, including
only control interventions that would not be expected to have
specific effects on schizophrenic symptoms. In contrast, NICE3
compared CBT with ‘other active treatments’ in one of their two
main sets of meta-analyses, including under this heading not only
supportive counselling, befriending and the like, but also family
therapy. Clearly, such an approach blurs the boundary between
controlling for psychological confounding factors and examining
whether CBT is more effective than other forms of psychotherapy.
Our findings with respect to publication bias did not suggest
that this factor was exerting a significant influence on effect size.
Some statistical evidence of bias was found in the meta-analysis
of overall symptoms, and to a lesser extent in that of negative
symptoms, but this could hardly be regarded as convergent. Our
findings accord with those of Niemeyer et al,103 who imputed
studies in ten data-sets selected from five published meta-analyses
of CBT for schizophrenia and found that this resulted in no or
relatively minor reductions in pooled effect sizes. However, it goes
against findings in depression: Cuijpers et al104 found that an
initial pooled effect size of 0.69 in 89 studies reduced to 0.49 after
Duval & Tweedie’s trim and fill imputed 26 studies, and both Begg
& Mazumbar’s and Egger’s tests were highly significant.

 Cognitive–behavioural therapy for the symptoms of schizophrenia
Implications
Should CBT for schizophrenia continue to be recommended in
clinical practice? Given that we, and others including NICE,3 have
found evidence for only small effects on overall symptoms, plus
the fact that a large, methodologically rigorous 2008 trial failed
to demonstrate any effectiveness against relapse,11 the UK
government’s continued vigorous advocacy of this form of
treatment (for example see The All Party Parliamentary Group
on Mental Health105) might be considered puzzling. Our finding
of non-significant effects on positive symptoms in a relatively
large set of 21 masked studies also suggests that claims that CBT
is effective against these symptoms of the disorder are no longer
tenable. The same appears to apply to negative symptoms,
although here the possibility that specially adapted forms of
therapy will have an effect cannot be excluded (there have been
only two such studies to date). We did not examine the effect of
CBT on depression, anxiety or distress as a result of psychotic
symptoms, so no judgements on its effects in these areas can be
made.
