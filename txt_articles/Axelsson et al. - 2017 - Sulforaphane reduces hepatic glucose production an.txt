A potentially useful approach for drug discovery is to connect gene expression profiles of disease-affected tis-
sues (“disease signatures”) to drug signatures, but it remains to be shown whether it can be used to identify
clinically relevant treatment options. We analyzed coexpression networks and genetic data to identify a disease
signature for type 2 diabetes in liver tissue. By interrogating a library of 3800 drug signatures, we identified
sulforaphane as a compound that may reverse the disease signature. Sulforaphane suppressed glucose produc-
tion from hepatic cells by nuclear translocation of nuclear factor erythroid 2–related factor 2 (NRF2) and de-
creased expression of key enzymes in gluconeogenesis. Moreover, sulforaphane reversed the disease signature
in the livers from diabetic animals and attenuated exaggerated glucose production and glucose intolerance by
a magnitude similar to that of metformin. Finally, sulforaphane, provided as concentrated broccoli sprout ex-
tract, reduced fasting blood glucose and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) in obese patients with dysregulated
type 2 diabetes.
INTRODUCTION
A large number of genetic variants and tissue gene expression profiles
(“disease signatures”) have been associated with complex polygenic dis-
eases over the last decade (1). However, these data have not been max-
imally used to identify new therapies. One potentially interesting
approach is to use genetic and gene expression data to interrogate li-
braries of drug signatures (2). A drug signature denotes differentially
expressed genes between untreated and treated samples and takes into
account that most compounds have multiple gene effects on expression
beyond the primary target.
A few previous studies have used gene set enrichment analysis to
connect disease signatures with drug signatures and identified candi-
date drugs for cancer, neurological, and gastrointestinal disorders, as
suggested by subsequent effect studies in cell lines and animal models
(3–6). However, it remains to be shown whether such signature con-
nections can be used to identify compounds with pathophysiological
relevance for humans. The usefulness of this approach for drug dis-
covery may have been hampered by the fact that expression signatures
from disease-affected tissues largely represent secondary changes.
Moreover, the rank order of a gene in a signature based on expression
fold change does not necessarily reflect the pathophysiological impor-
tance of the gene.
To overcome these limitations, we generated disease signatures
based on disease-relevant tissue networks and human genetic data.
Network models have been proposed as a useful framework for study-
ing complex data (7). We and others have shown that highly
connected network genes (“hub genes”) are more likely to be involved
in disease processes (8, 9). Here, we hypothesized that disease signa-
tures reflecting the network topology and not merely expression fold
change could be used to identify compounds that reverse aberrantly
expressed key drivers of disease (overexpressed genes should be down-
regulated in the drug signature and vice versa). To test this strategy,
we analyzed diabetes-associated gene networks in liver tissue. We
aimed to identify compounds to treat exaggerated hepatic glucose pro-
duction in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D), which is a clinically se-
vere problem (10). T2D is affecting a growing number of the population,
with more than 300 million people worldwide afflicted by the disease
and even more having prediabetes (11). Metformin is currently the
first-line therapy and reduces hepatic glucose production via adenosine
monophosphate (AMP) kinase-dependent and kinase-independent
mechanisms (12–14). However, 15% of all T2D patients cannot take met-
formin because of reduced kidney glomerular filtration rate and hence
increased risk of lactic acidosis (15). Moreover, up to 30% of patients
treated with metformin develop nausea, bloating, abdominal pain, or
diarrhea, and 5 to 10% of the patients are therefore unable to continue
with metformin (16). Finding additional treatment options to reduce
exaggerated hepatic glucose production is therefore a high priority.
RESULTS
Network-based disease signatures were connected to
drug signatures
We first analyzed global gene expression data in liver tissue from an F2
cross between C57BL/6J ApoE−/− and C3H/HeJ ApoE−/− mice with a
total of 334 mice (169 female and 165 male). This cross, termed the B × H
cross, recapitulatesarangeof phenotypesassociatedwiththemetabolicsyn-
drome, including dyslipidemia, increased body weight, and hyperglycemia
(17, 18). We analyzed the topological overlap of the gene expression data
and identified groups of coexpressed genes (“modules”), comprising a
total of 1720 genes, which were associated with hyperglycemia.

 We then used four different criteria to select those of the 1720 genes
that were most likely to be involved in diabetes pathophysiology. First,
we analyzed connectivity (kin) as a measure of gene coexpression to
identify highly connected network hubs (7). Second, we used Bayesian
modeling to identify key regulators of the coexpression networks (19).
Third, we used genetic risk variants associated with T2D to inform the
generation of the disease signature by constructing a protein-protein
interaction network with a total of 319 genes centered on those that
are in close proximity of known T2D risk variants (20). Fourth, we used
data on single-nucleotide polymorphisms associated with gene expres-
sion traits (eSNPs) in human liver samples to identify genes with eSNPs
that were also risk variants for T2D, because such genes have been sug-
gested to cause metabolic disease (21). The rationale for using these four
criteria was to incorporate both network topology and genetic
information to focus on those of the 1720 genes that were likely to have
the highest pathophysiological impact based on previous reports on
features that are important for metabolic disease networks (8, 17, 19, 21).
A leave-one-out approach with linear modeling was used to impute
weights for each criterion. The linear modeling was iterated for each of
the four criteria variables. Solving the resultant equation system
provided a coefficient for each variable, which was used as a weight
to reflect the relative importance of the variable. Finally, we computed
a score for each of the 1720 genes based on the four criteria and used it
as a filter to generate a 50-gene disease signature for T2D in liver tissue
(table S1).
We then compiled a library of 3852 drug signatures from publically
available data sets at the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) or the
European Bioinformatics Institute based on experiments with compound
treatments of cell lines or primary tissues and analyzed by Affymetrix,
Agilent, or Illumina chips (see table S2 for a list of the compounds). The
hepatic diabetes signature and eachof the drug signatureswere analyzed
using an enrichment metric based on a Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test.
The average KS enrichment metric for the 10 top-ranked drugs was sig-
nificantly higher when using the filtered 50-gene disease signature com-
pared with using 50 genes randomly selected out of the 1720 genes or
using all 1720 genes (>2-fold higher KS scores; P < 0.001; the top-ranked
drugsdiffered depending on which disease signature wasused), suggest-
ing that the disease signature filtered by the four criteria generates more
robust data. The drug signature that exhibited the highest overlap with
the 50-gene hepatic diabetes signature was derived from studies of sul-
foraphane (SFN)–treated human hepatocytes (GEO accession number
GSE20479) (22). A complete rank list of all compounds is provided in
table S3.
SFN reduces glucose production in hepatoma cells
Several other methods could potentially be used to compare disease and
drug signatures, and it is critical that bioinformatics predictions are val-
idated both in vitro and in vivo. We therefore investigated the com-
pound with the highest overlap, SFN, in greater detail. SFN is a
naturally occurring isothiocyanate found in cruciferous vegetables such
as broccoli. It activates nuclear factor erythroid 2–related factor 2
(NRF2) by modifying the conformation of Kelch-like ECH-associated
protein 1 (KEAP1) cytoplasmic chaperone, thus releasing NRF2 for
translocation to the nucleus and transcriptional activation of genes with
the antioxidant response element (ARE) in their promoters (23). Al-
though SFN uptake into cells leads to an initial burst of reactive oxygen
species, it then rapidly activates the KEAP1-NRF2-ARE system to in-
duce antioxidant enzymes and increase cellular glutathione for an over-
all antioxidative effect (24). As an inducer of endogenous antioxidants,
SFN has been extensively studied for its protective effects in different
experimental models associated with oxidative stress and chemoprotec-
tion (25), inflammatory disorders (26), and fatty liver disease (27, 28).
To date, SFN has not been implicated for the treatment of exaggerated
hepatic glucose production in T2D.
We first studied the effect of SFN on glucose production using H4IIE
cells, a rat hepatoma cell line. Preincubation with SFN at 0.5 to 10 mM
for 24 hours resulted in a dose-dependent decrease of glucose produc-
tion during a subsequent 5-hour incubation in glucose-free buffer sup-
plemented with gluconeogenetic substrates (41% decrease at 3 mM; P =
0.0009; Fig. 1A). SFN at doses up to 3 mM did not induce apoptosis (fig.
S1A). Metformin also decreased glucose production in a dose-
dependent manner (Fig. 1B). Addition of insulin to the buffer reduced
glucose production by 40% in control cells. The combined effects of
SFN and insulin on glucose production were only additive (Fig. 1A).
In contrast, we observed synergistic effects of metformin and insulin
on glucose production (P = 0.005 for analysis of additive versus syner-
gistic effects at 250 mM metformin; Fig. 1B and Materials and Methods).
We also pretreated H4IIE cells with high concentrations of palmitate
(250 mM) to mimic diabetogenic conditions. Palmitate pretreatment
increased glucose production by 34%, in line with previous observations
(29, 30). Concomitant treatment with SFN not only prevented the ex-
aggerated glucose production but also reduced overall glucose produc-
tion by 45% (P = 0.0011; Fig. 1C).
The effect of SFN on glucose production is mediated by the
transcription factor NRF2
We then investigated the effect of SFN on nuclear translocation of
NRF2, which has been demonstrated as a major mechanism of action
for SFN in other cell types (31). We observed a clear dose-dependent
effect of SFN on nuclear translocation of NRF2 in the H4IIE cells
(Fig. 1D). Silencing of Nrf2 by small interfering RNA (siRNA) (81 ±
3% knockdown) increased glucose production 2.3-fold (P = 0.0009)
and attenuated the relative effect of SFN on glucose production (P =
0.007; Fig. 1E). This suggests that a large part of SFN-mediated reduc-
tion of glucose production is mediated via NRF2, although we do not
exclude that other mechanisms may also be involved.
SFN has no effect on insulin signaling and mitochondrial
oxygen consumption
Because insulin is a key regulator of hepatic glucose production in the fed
state, we next examined the effect of SFN on key enzymes in the insulin
signaling cascade. However, in H411E cells, insulin-mediated phospho-
rylation of insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1/Tyr608) and AKT serine/
threonine kinase 1 (AKT1/Ser473) was unaffected by SFN. Moreover,
we observed no effect of SFN on insulin signaling after palmitate pre-
treatment (fig. S1B). The observations are in agreement with the data
on glucose production (Fig. 1A), which suggest that the combined effects
of SFN and insulin on glucose production are nonsynergistic and merely
additive. These results show that the effect of SFN on glucose production
is not mainly exerted via altered insulin signaling.
Because NRF2 affects the activity of complex 1 in the mitochon-
drial respiratory chain via limitation of substrates (32), we also in-
vestigated whether SFN affected mitochondrial function using the
Seahorse XF24 instrument to measure the mitochondrial oxygen con-
sumption rate (OCR) in H4IIE cells in response to gluconeogenetic
substrates (L-lactate, pyruvate, and L-glutamine). However, SFN (3 mM)
did not affect mitochondrial OCR under these experimental con-
ditions (fig. S1C).

 SFN reduces the expression of genes involved in
glucose production
To further explore the mechanism by which SFN affects glucose pro-
duction, we analyzed the expression of genes involved in gluco-
neogenesis, a major determinant of hepatic glucose production. Of
the four key enzymes involved in gluconeogenesis—pyruvate carboxylase
(PC; P = 0.2), phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase 1 (PCK1; also known
as PEPCK-C; P = 0.004), fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase 1 (FBP1; P =
0.0007), and glucose-6-phosphatase, catalytic subunit (G6PC; P =
0.002)—all except PC were significantly down-regulated by SFN, as as-
sessed by expression microarrays of H4IIE cells (table S4). Quantitative
reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction of H4IIE cells treated
with 3 mM SFN for 24 hours confirmed these findings, with Pck1 and
G6pc being the gluconeogenesis genes most strongly down-regulated
by SFN (Fig. 1F). PCK1 is of special interest because it catalyzes the con-
version of oxaloacetate to phosphoenolpyruvate, the rate-limiting step
in gluconeogenesis. SFN reduced PCK1 protein by 60% in H4IIE cells
(P = 0.0011; Fig. 1G). We also analyzed the effects of SFN on PCK1
protein after Nrf2 knockdown and observed a mere 22% reduction of
PCK1, which is a significant attenuation compared with the 60% reduc-
tion in control cells (P = 0.0082 for the comparison of SFN effects in
Nrf2-KD versus control cells; Fig. 1G). This suggests that PCK1
down-regulation by SFN is largely mediated via NRF2.
We next silenced Pck1 with siRNA (Pck1-KD) in H4IIE cells (69 ±
2% knockdown), which resulted in a 38% reduction of glucose produc-
tion. The inhibitory effect of SFN on glucose production was attenuated
by 23% (49% reduction of glucose production by SFN in control cells
compared to 38% reduction in Pck1-KD cells; P = 0.025; Fig. 1H). In
contrast, the effect of metformin (250 mM) was unaffected by Pck1-KD
(38% reduction in both cases), showing that metformin-induced

 suppression of glucose production is independent of PCK1. We also
observed that the effect of insulin was significantly reduced (33% re-
duction of effect size; P = 0.037) in Pck1-KD cells, confirming previ-
ous observations that PCK1 is regulated by insulin (33). Together,
these data suggest that a major mechanism for SFN-mediated reduction
of glucose production is down-regulation of key gluconeogenetic en-
zymes via NRF2. The mechanism of action of SFN is therefore different
from that of metformin, which acts via AMP-activated protein kinase,
by loweringcyclic AMPandinhibitingmitochondrialglycerophosphate
dehydrogenase (12–14). As with metformin, which has multiple modes
of action, we do not exclude that additional mechanismsmay contribute
to the effects of SFN on glucose production.
SFN reduces glucose production in mouse hepatocytes
We also verified that SFN affects glucose production in primary mouse
hepatocytes. Hepatocytes were incubated with SFN in the presence of
palmitate for 24 hours before the experiments to mimic a diabetogenic
milieu. Palmitate incubation increased glucose production 2.2-fold. SFN
induced a 45% reduction of glucose production in palmitate-exposed he-
patocytes (P = 0.042; Fig. 2A) and restored glucose production to levels
observed in the absence of palmitate. These data corroborate the obser-
vations in H4IIE cells and show that SFN treatment suppresses exagger-
ated glucose production triggered by a diabetogenic milieu in vitro.
SFN prevents the development of glucose intolerance in
diet-challenged rats
After these experiments, we aimed to investigate the effect of SFN in
different animal models in vivo. We first assessed the ability of SFN
to prevent the development of glucose intolerance. Male Wistar rats re-
ceived a diet with 45% fat content [high-fat diet (HFD)] and were con-
comitantly treated with SFN [2.5 mg/kg, intraperitoneally (ip), three
times per week] or vehicle over 15 weeks. In vehicle-treated animals,
fasting blood glucose, which reflects hepatic glucose production,
increased by 16% during the 15-week period on HFD (P = 0.0014).
By contrast, there was no impairment of fasting glucose in SFN-treated
rats (Fig. 2B). Over the entire period, fasting blood glucose was signif-
icantly lower in SFN-treated compared to nontreated rats (on average
7.5% lower; P = 2 × 10−5; Fig. 2B). At the end of the 15-week period,
there was also a significant difference in insulin sensitivity between the
SFN-treated group and the nontreated group as measured by an intra-
peritoneal insulin tolerance test (IPITT) [P = 0.032 for area under the
curve (AUC); Fig. 2C].
To further explore the ability of SFN to prevent glucose intolerance
under different dietary conditions, we changed diets after 15 weeks on
45% HFD. Half of the rats received instead a diet with even higher fat
content (60%), and half received a diet with 60% fructose content [high-
fructose diet (HFrD)] with continued treatment with SFN or vehicle.
SFN improved glucose tolerance, assessed by an intraperitoneal glucose
tolerance test (IPGTT) after 5 weeks on 60% HFrD (AUC30–120 P =
0.025,Fig.2D;Fig.2EforIPITT).Inratson60%HFD,SFNdidnotaffect
glucose tolerance (Fig. 2F) but changed insulin sensitivity as assessed by
an IPITT (AUC P = 0.0038; Fig. 2G). These findings show that SFN was
able to prevent the development of diet-induced glucose intolerance in-
duced by a 45% HFD or a 60% HFrD, although the 60% HFD was too
severe a stressor to fully prevent glucose intolerance by SFN.
We also extracted liver tissue from rats on 60% HFrD treated with
SFN (2.5 mg/kg) three times a week for 27 weeks and analyzed global
gene expression by microarray. We analyzed the effect of SFN on the
50-gene hepatic disease signature and observed that a significant frac-
tion of the signature was reversed in SFN-treated rats compared with
vehicle-treated animals (P < 0.0001, Fisher’s exact test; fig. S2).
SFN improves glucose tolerance in rats on HFD or HFrD
On the basis of the observation that SFN prevents diet-induced glucose
intolerance, we next wanted to test whether SFN could be used to treat
rats that had already developed glucose intolerance. Male Wistar rats
were therefore put on a 60% HFD for 11 months and then received
SFN (5 mg/kg, ip) daily for 14 days. Treatment with SFN resulted in
improved glucose tolerance, as assessed by an oral glucose tolerance test
(OGTT) (P = 0.049 for AUC30–120; Fig. 2H).
We next compared the effects of SFN and metformin on glucose
toleranceand hepatic glucose production invivo. Male Wistar rats that
had been fed a 60% HFrD for 6 months were treated with either SFN
(10 mg/kg, ip) or metformin [300 mg/kg, per os (po)] for 9 to 12 days.
Glucose tolerance was significantly improved by both SFN and metfor-
min during an OGTT (AUC30–120 P = 0.046 for SFN-treated versus un-
treated rats and P = 0.019 for metformin-treated versus untreated rats;
Fig. 2I). On the basis of our observations in H4IIE cells and primary
hepatocytes, we hypothesized that SFN would reduce hepatic glucose
production. Hepatic glucose production was assessed by an intra-
peritoneal pyruvate tolerance test (IPPTT), which showed that SFN sig-
nificantly reduced blood glucose at 30 and 120 min and reduced
AUC30–120 by 20% (P = 0.049, one-sided t test; Fig. 2J). Metformin sig-
nificantly reduced blood glucose at 60 min during the IPPTT and re-
duced AUC30–120 by 25% (P = 0.046, one-sided t test). These results
demonstrate that SFN improves glucose tolerance in rats by a magni-
tude similar to that of metformin.
SFN improves glucose tolerance in mice with
diet-induced diabetes
To test the effect of SFN in a more severe model of diabetes, we used
C57BL/6J mice, which develop overt diabetes when challenged with an
HFD. After 10 weeks on a 60% HFD, male C57BL/6J mice were treated
with SFN (10 mg/kg) daily for 4 weeks (same dose as used in the rat
experiments). We also tested the effect of a considerably lower dose
(0.5 mg/kg SFN daily). The high dose of SFN improved both fasting
glucose (P = 0.044) and glucose tolerance (AUC30–120 P = 0.012; Fig.
3A) as measured by an IPGTT. In this model, SFN did not affect insulin
sensitivity (Fig. 3B). The low dose of SFN had no effect on glucose tol-
erance. Extracted liver from the mice treated with SFN at high dose had
reduced triglyceride content relative to mice receiving the low dose (P =
0.038; Fig. 3C). In lean mice receiving a low-fat control diet, glucose
tolerance was unaffected by SFN (Fig. 3A).
We next performed specific measurements of absolute gluco-
neogenetic rate in C57BL/6J mice on 60% HFD using mass spectrom-
etry of glucose fragments after ingestion of deuterium water combined
with hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps. The mice were treated with
SFN (10 mg/kg) or control vehicle daily for 4 weeks. After a 7- to 9-hour
fast and a 2-hour infusion of [6,6-2H2]glucose, glucose production was
almost entirely derived from gluconeogenesis (101 ± 2% for control and
97 ± 3% for SFN-treated mice). In the controls, we observed a clear cor-
relation between body weight of the mice (range, 36 to 47 g) and glu-
coneogenetic rate (R2 = 0.81; P = 0.002). This is in line with reports in
humans showing that glucose production is exaggerated in obese com-
pared to lean subjects (34–36). In SFN-treated mice, the correlation be-
tween weight and increased gluconeogenesis was completely abolished
(R2 = 0.11; P = 0.5), suggesting that SFN protects against increased glu-
coneogenesis in the overweight animals. There was no difference when

 taking all animals into account, independent of weight. However, by
using a post hoc analysis of the heaviest mice, we observed that SFN sig-
nificantly reduced absolute gluconeogenesis rate compared to controls in
this subset (6.5 mg/kg per minute in control and 5.6 mg/kg per minute in
SFN-treated mice; P = 0.035; Fig. 3D).
During the clamp, we also measured total body insulin-stimulated
glucose uptake (Rd clamp), which reflects insulin sensitivity. This was
similar between the groups [ctrl (11.8 mg/kg) and SFN (12.8 mg/kg);
Fig. 3E], which parallels our findings in H4IIE cells that SFN does
not influence insulin signaling. Together, these experiments demon-
strate that SFN improves glucose tolerance in animals with diet-induced
diabetes via reduced gluconeogenetic rate.

studied in T2D patients
Prompted by these findings in vitro and in vivo, we set out to investigate

 several clinical studies for cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary dis-
ease, autism, and inflammatory diseases (www.clinicaltrials.gov) [we
used high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)–purified SFN
at 99.5% in our cell and animal studies, but this has not been used for
human studies so far].
Here, we used a dried powder of an aqueous extract of broccoli
sprouts, which contains high concentrations of glucoraphanin, the inert
glucosinolate precursor of SFN. Glucoraphanin is converted to SFN by
the release of intrinsic sprout myrosinase during chewing and also by
human enteric bacteria (37–40). After intake, the plasma concentration
of SFN rises within 1 hour with a mean half-life of 1.77 ± 0.13 hours, but
SFN exerts a sustained effect on gene expression (41). Renal tubular se-
cretion is suggested to play a major role in the elimination (37). Safety
studies using BSE corresponding to 50 to 400 mmol SFN daily have
shown that BSE is well tolerated without clinically significant adverse
effects (42–45).
We first tested the effect of BSE relative to HPLC-purified SFN on
hepatic glucose production in H4IIE cells. The amount of SFN in BSE
(SFN equivalents) was determined on the basis of the concentration of
SFN obtained when glucoraphanin in BSE is hydrolyzed by adding ex-
ogenousmyrosinase. We confirmed that BSE (at 3mM SFN equivalents)
was as effective as HPLC-purified SFN (3 mM) in suppressing glucose
production (P = 0.004 for BSE and P = 0.004 for SFN relative to control;
fig. S3A). No exogenous myrosinase was added during the experiment,
demonstrating that the BSE contained sufficient amounts of myrosinase
to effectively convert inert glucoraphanin to SFN.
Next, we wanted to ascertain that the effect of BSE on glucose pro-
duction was caused by the SFN component. We therefore boiled the
BSE, which inactivates myrosinase and prevents the conversion of glu-
coraphanin to SFN (46). After boiling, BSE had no effect on glucose
production (fig. S3A). We also showed that the placebo (maltodextrin
sprayed with copper-chlorophyllin) to be used in the clinical trial had
no effect on glucose production. Moreover, we verified that BSE had a
similareffecttothatofSFNonglucosecontrolinanimals.MaleC57BL/6J
mice were made diabetic by a 60% HFD for 4 weeks and were then given
BSE via gavage once daily at a dose corresponding to SFN (1.1 mg/kg)
for 4 weeks. The BSE-treated mice had significantly lower fasting blood
glucose compared to controls (9.6 versus 10.9 mM; P = 0.009) and im-
proved glucose control during an IPGTT (fig. S3B).
After these verifications, we recruited 103 T2D patients for a random-
ized double-blind placebo-controlled study with BSE for 12 weeks.
Patients with either well-regulated or dysregulated T2D (defined as hav-
ing HbA1c above 50 mmol/mol) were recruited. All patients were of
Scandinavian ethnicity and had been diagnosed with T2D less than
10 years ago. We hypothesized that BSE would improve fasting glucose
(reflecting hepatic glucose production) and reduce HbA1c in patients
with dysregulated T2D but have no effect in patients with well-regulated
T2D, because well-regulated T2D patients exhibit impaired peripheral
glucose uptake rather than exaggerated glucose production (47). The
patients with dysregulated T2D were further divided into nonobese
and obese [body mass index (BMI) > 30 kg/m2], because hepatic glucose
production has been shown to be more severely affected in obese com-
pared to lean patients (34–36).
A total of 97 patients completed the study, of whom 60 had well-
regulated and 37 dysregulated T2D. Of the patients with dysregulated
T2D, 20 were nonobese and 17 were obese. All patients except three
(well-regulated) had metformin treatment. The patients underwent ini-
tial blood sampling, including fasting glucose and HbA1c, and an
OGTT, after which they received oral BSE or placebo once daily for
12 weeks. The BSE contained 150 mmol SFN per dose, which corre-
sponds to one-third of the dose per body surface area compared with
the animal experiments (using 10 mg/kg). This dose has been well

 tolerated in clinical safety studies (42–45). A second OGTT and blood
sampling were conducted at the end of the 12-week treatment period.
The difference in fasting blood glucose (Dglucose) and HbA1c
(DHbA1c) before and after treatment were determined for each patient.
BSEs improves fasting glucose and HbA1c in obese patients
with dysregulated T2D
We observed a clear association between HbA1c levels at start of treatment
and DHbA1c in response to BSE treatment (DHbA1c, 0.2 mmol/mol
reduction per 1 mmol/mol higher HbA1c at start; P = 0.004, Fig. 4A),
whereas there was no association in the placebo group (P = 0.5). There
was also an association between BMI and DHbA1c in BSE-treated pa-
tients (DHbA1c, 0.4 mmol/mol reduction per 1 kg/m2 higher BMI; P =
0.015 for the BSE group; not significant for the placebo group).
We then analyzed the patientswithdysregulatedT2Din detail, using
intraindividual one-tailed comparisons before and after treatment.
There was a significant change of fasting blood glucose (Dglucose) in
BSE-treated compared with placebo-treated subjects (P = 0.023).
Fasting plasma glucose was on average 9 ± 0.4 mM after placebo treat-
ment and 8.3 ± 0.3 mM after BSE treatment. There was, however, no
difference in DHbA1c between BSE and placebo in the entire group of
patients with dysregulated T2D. In obese patients (BMI > 30 kg/m2)
with dysregulated T2D, who we hypothesized would benefit most from
the treatment, both Dglucose (P = 0.036) and DHbA1c (P = 0.034)
were significantly affected by BSE (Fig. 4B and Table 1). At the end
of the 12-week period, HbA1c was 57 mmol/mol in placebo-treated
and 53 mmol/mol in BSE-treated patients (DHbA1c, −4 mmol/mol;
P = 0.034). There was a concomitant decrease of fasting blood glucose
(8.9 mM with placebo and 8.2 mM with BSE; P = 0.036 for Dglucose;
Fig. 4B) in these patients.
We also analyzed the serum concentration of SFN at the final visit
(immediately before the OGTT) in the obese patients with dysregu-
lated T2D using HPLC. SFN serum concentration ranged from 0.6 to
1.8nmol/mlinBSE-treatedpatients(theconcentrationwas0.01nmol/ml
in placebo-treated subjects). The variation may be attributed to individ-
ual differences in bioavailability, body weight, and distribution volume.
There was a clear association between serum SFN concentration and
change in fasting blood glucose (Dglucose) in the BSE-treated patients
(P = 0.002, corrected for body weight; Fig. 4C). The serum concentra-
tions of SFN in BSE-treated patients (0.6 to 1.8 mM) were in the same
range as the concentrations that reduced glucose production in vitro in
H4IIE cells (Fig. 1A).
Previous studies using 13C magnetic resonance spectroscopy have
demonstrated that elevated fasting glucose production in T2D patients
couldbe entirely attributed to increased gluconeogenesis. Our data from
H4IIE cells show that SFN affects glucose production by reducing the
expression of genes involved in gluconeogenesis rather than affecting
insulin sensitivity. Moreover, SFN reduced gluconeogenetic rate in

 2 hours of the OGTT (Table 1). There was a clear association between
the reduction of fasting blood glucose (Dglucose) and the decrease in
HbA1c (DHbA1c) in patients with dysregulated T2D (P = 0.019). This
association was also significant after correction for HOMA-IR, ISI, and
2-hour glucose (P = 0.0003), suggesting that the change in HbA1c was
mainly caused by reduced fasting blood glucose. We also estimated he-
patic fat content using a validated fatty liver index (48) but observed no
effect of BSE on this metric (Table 1). BSE did not change body weight,
BMI, liver parameters, cholesterol concentration, plasma triglycerides,
or blood hemoglobin concentration. BSE had no effect in patients with
well-regulated T2D. It remains possible, however, that higher doses of
SFN could also affect IR, in addition to the pronounced direct effect on
the expression of gluconeogenesis genes.
BSE is most effective in obese patients with
dysregulated T2D
Glucose production is exaggerated in dysregulated T2D, which is re-
flected in the higher fasting blood glucose among the patients with dys-
regulated T2D in our study (8.6 ± 0.2 in patients with dysregulated T2D
versus 7.5 ± 0.2 mM in patients with well-regulated T2D; P = 0.0001).
Consequently, BSE reduced fasting glucose in patients with dysregu-
lated T2D but not in patients with well-regulated T2D (P = 0.023).
We also observed an association between BMI and BSE-induced change
in HbA1c (P = 0.017), and HbA1c was significantly reduced after BSE
treatment in obese patients with dysregulated T2D (P = 0.034; Fig. 4B).
BSE was more effective in lowering fasting blood glucose in patients
with elevated plasma triglyceride concentrations (P = 0.046 for the as-
sociation between plasma triglycerides at study start and Dglucose; an
inverted association was observed in placebo-treated patients; P = 0.008;
Fig. 4D). It is also notable that BSE was more effective in lowering
fasting blood glucose in patients with high HOMA-IR (P = 0.058 for
the association between HOMA-IR and Dglucose; Fig. 4E), and the
BSE-induced reduction of HbA1c correlated with high fatty liver index
(P = 0.045; Fig. 4F).
No severe adverse effects of BSE were reported
Most patients tolerated the BSE well. Eight patients receiving BSE and
seven patients receiving placebo reported gastrointestinal side effects
such as loose stools and flatulence, typically present during the first
few days of the treatment period, after which these symptoms disap-
peared. Ten BSE-treated and five placebo-treated patients reported mild
respiratory infections, and there were also a few other reported adverse
events, including orthopedic ailments, most likely unrelated to the study
compound (table S5). Of the 103 patients, 6 (5 with BSE and 1 with
placebo) discontinued the study because of nausea (2 patients), head-
ache (1 patient), glucose above 15 mM (one of the exclusion criteria;
1 patient), hospital visit for suspected ileus (later successfully treated;
1 patient), and depression (1 patient on placebo) (table S6).
DISCUSSION
Together, our data show that SFN reduces glucose production, partly via
NRF2 translocation and decreased expression of key gluconeogenetic en-
zymes, and that highly concentrated SFN administered as BSE improves
fasting glucose and HbA1c in obese patients with dysregulated T2D. BSE
was well tolerated, and SFN reduced glucose production by mechanisms
different from that of metformin. SFN also protects against diabetic com-
plications such as neuropathy, renal failure, and atherosclerosis in animal
models because of its antioxidative effects (49–52).
OurdatasuggestthatBSEhasadirecteffectongluconeogenesisrather
than hepatic insulin sensitivity, but the degree of IR may still influence the
efficacy of BSE via altered constitutive NRF2 activity. It has been shown
that insulin signaling activates NRF2 via phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase
(53). Moreover, studies in cardiomyocytes have shown that NRF2 is ac-
tivated at the early stages of T2D to protect against increased reactive ox-
ygen species but is reduced at later stages of the disease (54). This is
further supported by observations of reduced NRF2 expression in
animals with IR (55, 56) and hepatic steatosis (27, 28).
It is not surprising that BSE was most effective in obese patients with
dysregulated T2D. First, our animal experiments showed an effect of SFN
on glucose controlin metabolically dysregulatedanimalson aHFDbutnot
in metabolically well-regulated animals on a low-fat diet. Second, gluco-
neogenetic rate was correlated with body weight in mice with diet-induced
diabetes, and SFN reduced gluconeogenetic rate specifically in the heaviest
mice. Third, hepatic glucose production is often exaggerated in patients
with high HbA1c, whereas patients with low HbA1c primarily have an im-
pairment of peripheral glucose uptake (47). Fourth, it has been shown that
hepatic glucose production is increased particularly in obese T2D patients,
potentially via elevated free fatty acids (34–36).
There is abnormal regulation of hepatic glucose production early in
the development of T2D, but it is typically compensated for by
increased insulin secretion (57). SFN has been shown to protect from
pancreatic b cell damage in animals (58). We observed no changes in
insulin secretion, measured as HOMA-B and insulinogenic index, and
BSE did not affect fasting glucose or HbA1c in well-regulated T2D pa-
tients. However, we observed that SFN prevented the development of
hyperglycemia in diet-challenged rats, and it would be of interest to lon-
gitudinally study the long-term effects of BSE on glucose production
and insulin secretion capacity in prediabetic individuals.
Glitazones and metformin were not ranked particularly high in the
drug comparisons, suggesting that they do not affect the hepatic gene
coexpression network that was associated with hyperglycemia in this
case but exert their effects via other pathways. It is not entirely
surprising because these drugs have different mechanisms of action
from that of SFN.
It has been demonstrated that 1% [DCCT (Diabetes Control and
Complications Trial) units] decrease of HbA1c corresponds to 37% re-
duced risk of microvascular complications (59). BSE treatment reduced
HbA1c from 57.1 mmol/mol (or 7.38%) to 53.4 mmol/mol (or 7.04%)
in obese patients with dysregulated T2D. The patients thereby reached
the 7% treatment goal recommended by the American Diabetes Asso-
ciation (60), which is likely to represent a clinically meaningful effect.
Although the effect of BSE on glucose production was abolished in
vitro when the conversion of glucoraphanin to SFN was prevented, we
cannot fully determine that SFN explains the effect of BSE given to pa-
tients. High doses of BSE cannot yet be recommended to patients as a
drug treatment but would require further studies, including data on
which groups of patients would potentially benefit most from it. Finally,
the findings provide support for using disease signatures based on co-
expression networks to interrogate drug signatures, thereby using the
large public repositories of gene expression data, as one of many stra-
tegies for repurposing compounds of immediate clinical relevance.

screening visit, followed by an OGTT 2 weeks later. Placebo or BSE
powder was thereafter provided in a double-blind manner as dry mix-
tures in sealed portion size bags of similar shape and size. Randomiza-
tion was done using a computer-based block randomization algorithm.
After a 12-week treatment period, the patients returned for a final visit
including an OGTT. All data analyses were performed with blinded as-
sessment of outcomes. Only patients who had taken >75% of their com-
pound during the total study period and >80% during the last month
were included in the analyses. The clinical study was conducted at Skåne
University Hospital, Sweden. The study was approved by the Regional
Ethics Committee in Lund, and all patients expressed written informed
consent. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier is NCT02801448. For details, see
the Supplementary Materials and Methods.
Statistics
Experimental in vitro and animal data were analyzed using Student’s
t test. Additive versus synergistic effects of SFN, metformin, and insulin
on glucoseproduction were determinedby comparing expectedandob-
served data. Because insulin caused 40% reduction and metformin at
250 mM caused 40% reduction, we would expect 64% reduction if the
effects were only additive, whereas the observed reduction was 70% (P =
0.005 for expected versus observed effects as shown in Fig. 1B). For the
clinical study, the primary effect variables were HbA1c and fasting glu-
cose after versus before the treatment (DHbA1c and Dglucose). All
analyses were done using one-tailed Student’s t test between placebo
and BSE arms. We also used two-tailed linear regression to compare
the relationship between metabolic variables and DHbA1c andDglucose
as described in the text.
