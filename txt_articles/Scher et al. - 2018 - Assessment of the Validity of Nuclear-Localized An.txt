IMPORTANCE A blood test to determine whether to treat patients with metastatic
castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) with an androgen receptor signaling (ARS)
inhibitor or taxane is an unmet medical need.
OBJECTIVE To determine whether a validated assay for the nuclear-localized androgen
receptor splice variant 7 (AR-V7) protein in circulating tumor cells can determine differential
overall survival among patients with mCRPC treated with taxanes vs ARS inhibitors.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This blinded correlative study conducted from
December 31, 2012, to September 1, 2016, included 142 patients with histologically confirmed
mCRPC and who were treated at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, The Royal
Marsden, or the London Health Sciences Centre. Blood samples were obtained prior to
administration of ARS inhibitors or taxanes as a second-line or greater systemic therapy for
progressing mCRPC.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Overall survival after treatment with an ARS inhibitor or
taxane in relation to pretherapy AR-V7 status.
RESULTS Among the 142 patients in the study (mean [SD] age, 69.5 [9.6] years), 70 were
designated as high risk by conventional prognostic factors. In this high-risk group, patients
positive for AR-V7 who were treated with taxanes had superior overall survival relative to
those treated with ARS inhibitors (median overall survival, 14.3 vs 7.3 months; hazard ratio,
0.62; 95% CI, 0.28-1.39; P = .25). Patients negative for AR-V7 who were treated with ARS
inhibitors had superior overall survival relative to those treated with taxanes (median overall
survival, 19.8 vs 12.8 months; hazard ratio, 1.67; 95% CI, 1.00-2.81; P = .05).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE This study suggests that nuclear-localized AR-V7 protein in
circulating tumor cells can identify patients who may live longer with taxane chemotherapy
vs ARS inhibitor treatment.

 A
ndrogenreceptorsignaling(ARS)inhibitors,suchasabi-
raterone acetate and enzalutamide, and taxanes, such
as docetaxel and cabazitaxel, are the most widely used
drug classes of the US Food and Drug Administration–
approved systemic therapies for progressing metastatic cas-
tration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). Prospective ran-
domized clinical trial data comparing these drugs directly are
lacking, but based on individual trial data, comparative safety
profiles,andmodeofadministration(oralvsintravenous),ARS
inhibitors are the preferred choice of treatment at the first-
line decision point in the management of mCRPC.1 However,
because response or failure to 1 ARS inhibitor does not uni-
formly guarantee response or nonresponse to a second ARS
inhibitor,2-4 there are no formal guidelines on how best to se-
quence these agents to optimize individual patient outcomes.5
Inroutineclinicalpractice,themajorityofpatientswithmCRPC
receive a second ARS inhibitor after first-line ARS inhibition
fails, despite the low prostate-specific antigen (PSA) re-
sponse rate.6 In contrast, those who receive chemotherapy as
the second-line treatment after progression on first-line treat-
ment with an ARS inhibitor have, on average, a high initial
PSA response rate. To date, however, no difference in overall
survival (OS) between these groups has been demonstrated.6
A test that can better inform the choice of therapy in the sec-
ond-line or greater setting is a critical unmet need in patient
management.
Several diverse resistance mechanisms to ARS inhibitors
have been identified through molecular profiling, many of
which have been further elucidated to varying degrees in pre-
clinical model systems. They include, but are not limited to,
alterationsinsecondarysignalingpathwaysandchangesinthe
androgen receptor itself, such as amplification, mutations, and
splice variants with truncations in the ligand-binding
domain,7-10 of which androgen receptor splice variant 7
(AR-V7) is the most widely studied. Androgen receptor splice
variant 7 is an alternatively spliced isoform of the AR gene
(OMIM: 313700) that contains the DNA-binding domain but
lacks the regulatory ligand-binding domain, leading to
constitutive activation of oncogenic signaling and cell
proliferation.11,12
The association between the detection of AR-V7 messen-
ger RNA (mRNA) in an enriched (selected) fraction of circu-
lating tumor cells (CTCs), poor PSA responses, and shorter ra-
diographicprogression-freesurvivaltimesaftertreatmentwith
ARS inhibitors was first reported in 2014.13 Follow-up studies
with the same assay showed not only a negative association
with OS for patients positive for AR-V7 who were treated with
ARS inhibitors14 but also that PSA response and survival with
taxane-based therapy were independent of AR-V7 status.15
Taken together, the results suggested that AR-V7 status could
be used to guide the choice of treatment for men with pro-
gressive mCRPC in need of a change in therapy. A series of re-
ports followed, using a range of AR-V7 assays in smaller co-
horts,somerefuting16andothersconfirmingtheresults,17albeit
to variable degrees, but, to our knowledge, none used OS as
the primary outcome measure. Missing from several reports
were the details of the analytical performance of the assay it-
self, and, in particular, the demonstration that the assay was
fitforthepurposeofusingthereportedresulttosupportaclini-
calvalidationeffort.18Fortheassaysthathadachievedthelevel

onstration of clinical utility as a biomarker indicating that out-
comes would be improved by use of the test result to inform
the treatment decision relative to nonuse of the test.19 Line of
therapy was also rarely considered.
Use of the mRNA determinant as a blood-based bio-
marker has limitations such as stability of the blood sample,
which varies as a function of the collection tube used and the
time to sample processing, and in the case of a transcription
factor such as AR-V7, an inability to discern if the coded pro-
tein is actually localized in the nucleus of cells where it func-
tions to drive tumor growth. To address these consider-
ations, we developed a protein-based assay to discern the
presence and cellular localization of the AR-V7 protein in CTCs.
We used the Epic Sciences platform, a non–selection-based ap-
proach that deposits all nucleated cells from a patient’
s blood
sample onto pathologic test slides and uses fluorescent scan-
ners to image each cell and identify CTCs. The approach
enables a higher sensitivity of CTC detection than the only as-
saythatisclearedbytheUSFoodandDrugAdministration,Cell-
Search (Menarini Silicon Biosystems),20,21 as well as protein
biomarker assessment on individual CTCs.20-22 In another
report, the “training cohort,” 191 patients’ blood samples
were evaluated prior to initiation of either ARS inhibition or
taxanetherapy;higherPSAresponserates,longerradiographic
progression-free survival times, and better OS were observed
among patients with detectable nuclear-localized AR-V7–
positive CTCs who received taxanes, relative to those who
received ARS inhibitors.22
We report herein the validation of our findings in a sepa-
rate, independent, multicenter cohort in which the criteria for
a positive test result and the predicted outcome were prespeci-
fied, the clinical sites were blinded to the biomarker result, and
the processing laboratory was blinded to patient outcomes.
Two patient populations were evaluated: those for whom a
choice of therapy between ARS inhibitors and taxanes was re-
quired after first-line treatment for mCRPC failed (second line
Key Points
Question Is nuclear-localized androgen receptor splice variant 7
(AR-V7) protein in circulating tumor cells a treatment-selection
marker for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer?
Findings In this multi-institutional cohort study, 142 patients with
metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer treated with either
taxanes or androgen receptor signaling (ARS) inhibitors were
observed for up to 4.3 years. Pretherapy circulating tumor cell
status and treatment type were associated with overall survival;
patients with AR-V7–positive circulating tumor cells had superior
overall survival with taxanes vs ARS inhibitors, whereas patients
with AR-V7–negative circulating tumor cells had superior overall
survival with ARS inhibitors vs taxanes.
Meaning The validated nuclear-localized AR-V7 assay can be used
to select a taxane or ARS inhibitor and provide individual patient
benefit.

ceived ARS inhibition. This study reports on the patients
receiving second-line treatment to determine if an assay for
the nuclear-localized AR-V7 protein in CTCs can be used to
determine treatment for mCRPC.
Methods
Patient Population
Between December 31, 2012, and September 1, 2016, 286 blood
samples from 248 patients with histologically confirmed
mCRPC who were undergoing a change in systemic therapy for
progressive disease were obtained at Memorial Sloan Ketter-
ing Cancer Center (New York, New York), The Royal Marsden
(London, England), and London Health Sciences Centre
(London, Ontario, Canada). A total of 144 samples were ex-
cluded from analysis: 93 were obtained prior to administra-
tionoffirst-linetherapyformCRPC,24wereduplicatesamples
from the same patient, 23 were obtained prior to a drug that
was not an ARS inhibitor or taxane, 2 had insufficient mate-
rial for testing, and 2 had missing requisite preclinical mea-
sures (Figure 1). The remaining 142 blood samples (70 before
initiation of therapy with an ARS inhibitor; 72 before initia-
tion of therapy with a taxane) were used for the utility analy-
sis in the second-line or greater therapy setting. The institu-
tional review boards of Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer
Center, The Royal Marsden, and London Health Sciences
Centre approved this study. All patients provided written
informed consent.
All patients underwent a history taking that included de-
tails of stage at diagnosis, initial management and all subse-
quent systemic therapies, a physical examination, and labo-
ratorystudiesincludingcompletebloodcount,chemistrypanel
(albumin, alkaline phosphatase, lactate dehydrogenase, PSA,
and hemoglobin levels), and serum testosterone levels to con-
firm castration status (<50 ng/dL [to convert to nanomoles per
liter, multiply by 0.0347]). Documentation of disease progres-
sion required a minimum of 2 increasing PSA levels tested 1
or more weeks apart, new lesions as determined by bone scin-
tigraphy, and/or new or enlarging soft-tissue lesions as deter-
mined by computed tomography or magnetic resonance
imaging, per Prostate Cancer Clinical Trials Working Group 3
guidelines.23 Blood samples were obtained prior to initiation
ofeitherARSinhibitionortaxanetherapy.Thechoiceoftherapy
was at the discretion of the treating physician without knowl-
edge of CTC count or AR-V7 status. The Table summarizes the
characteristics of patients at the time the blood sample was
obtained.
CTC Collection
A blood sample (10 mL) from each participant was collected
in Streck tubes and processed within 48 hours. Red blood cells
were lysed, and approximately 3 million nucleated blood cells
weredispensedonto10to16glassmicroscopeslidesandplaced
at –80°C for long-term storage as previously described.22,24,25
Processing and testing of the blood samples were conducted
in laboratories certified under Clinical Laboratory Improve-
ment Amendments regulations.
CTC Immunofluorescent Staining and Analysis
Identification,characterization,andanalysisofCTCshavebeen
described previously.22,24,25 In brief, slides created from blood
samples from patients with mCRPC underwent automated im-
munofluorescent staining for DNA, cytokeratins, CD45, and
AR-V7. A rabbit monoclonal anti–AR-V7 antibody (EPR15656;
Abcam) was used for all applications described herein. Fluo-
rescent scanners and morphologic algorithms were used for
identification of CTCs, evaluating 2 slides per blood sample.
Clinical laboratory scientists licensed in California con-
ducted the final quality control of CTC classification and
subcellular biomarker localization.
Scoring criteria for AR-V7 were used as reported
previously.22,25 In short, blood samples with at least 1 CTC with
an intact nucleus and nuclear-localized AR-V7 signal to noise
ratio above a previously established and validated background
intensity per 2 slides tested ( ~ 1 mL of blood) were scored as
AR-V7positive.BloodsampleswithoutAR-V7–positiveCTCs,or

all and by the drug administered. The Wilcoxon rank sum test
andtheFisherexacttestwereusedtocomparetheclinicalchar-
acteristics between treatment groups. The probability of sur-
vival over time was assessed using a Kaplan-Meier estima-
tion.Aproportionalhazardsmodelincludingtreatment,AR-V7
status, and a treatment by AR-V7 status interaction was used
to gauge treatment efficacy (ARS inhibitors vs taxanes) with
respect to survival.
To investigate confounding factors that might influence
the decision to administer an ARS inhibitor or taxane, a risk
score was developed based on a prognostic model developed
from our training cohort22 and applied to the current cohort
(Table and the eFigure in the Supplement). A Cox propor-
tional hazards regression model with risk score classifica-
tion, treatment, AR-V7 status, each 2-way interaction, and the
3-way interaction, was then computed to evaluate AR-V7 as a
biomarker that could indicate treatment within a risk group.
All statistical analyses used R software (R Foundation for Sta-
tistical Computing), packages survival, sm, gee, ggplot2, and
survminer. P < .05 (2-sided) was considered significant.
Results
Clinical Characteristics of the Patient Population
Treatment selection was determined by the treating physi-
cian. Patients were not assigned randomly to either ARS in-
hibitors or taxanes, necessitating the evaluation of potential
imbalances in objective measures of disease severity (Table).
Of the 142 blood samples, 70 were obtained prior to initiating
treatment with an ARS inhibitor, and 72 were obtained prior
to initiating treatment with a taxane. Overall, there was greater
use of ARS inhibitors as a second-line treatment and more use
of taxanes in the later lines of therapy (proportion receiving
taxanes as second-line treatment, 0.30; proportion receiving
taxanes as third-line or greater treatment, 0.64; P < .001). The
observed median survival time was higher for patients receiv-

 ing ARS inhibitors than for patients receiving taxanes (16.0 vs
12.9 months), but no significant difference was detected in the
survivalrates(P = .18).Lookingatotherfactorsthatmighthave
influenced treatment choice, we were unable to discern a
difference between treatments based on median age (ARS
inhibitors, 70.5 years; taxanes, 70.0 years; P = .31), albumin
levels (ARS inhibitors, 4.0 g/dL; taxanes, 4.1 g/dL; P = .14), he-
moglobin levels (ARS inhibitors, 11.9 g/dL; taxanes, 11.5 g/dL;
P = .32), or the presence of lung and/or liver metastases
before therapy (proportion receiving ARS inhibitors, 0.2; pro-
portion receiving taxanes, 0.3 years; P = .18). However, pa-
tients receiving taxanes vs ARS inhibitors did have higher
lactate dehydrogenase levels (245.0 vs 203.0 U/L; P < .001),
PSA levels (133.4 vs 30.3 ng/mL; P < .001), and alkaline phos-
phatase levels (126.5 vs 9.5 U/L; P = .01). Rates of AR-V7 posi-
tivity were consistent between the training cohort (31 of 123
[25.2%]) and the validation cohort (34 of 142 [23.9%])
reported here.22
AR-V7 Status and Use of Taxanes and ARS Inhibitors
Overall survival based on treatment and AR-V7 status is pre-
sented in Figure 2. Patients treated with ARS inhibition had the
most favorable survival outcome if they were AR-V7 negative
andhadtheleastfavorablesurvivaloutcomeiftheywereAR-V7
positive. The median survival of patients negative for AR-V7
was 19.8 months for those treated with an ARS inhibitor and
12.8 months for those treated with a taxane (hazard ratio, 1.67;
95% CI, 1.00-2.81; P = .05) (Figure 2A). In contrast, for pa-
tients with AR-V7–positive CTCs, those receiving taxanes had
longerobservedmediansurvivaltimesrelativetothosetreated
withARSinhibitors(14.3vs7.3months;hazardratio,0.62;95%
CI, 0.28-1.39; P = .25) (Figure 2A). That the observed differ-
ence was not statistically significant may have been attribut-
able to the small sample size.
Owing to the observational nature of the study, a patient-
specific risk score, developed from the training cohort, was
incorporated into the analysis. The coefficients in the model
used to determine the patient risk scores are shown in the
eFigure in the Supplement. The estimated median survival as
a function of treatment, AR-V7 status, and risk score is de-
picted in Figure 2B. There is greater balance in patient num-
bers between the 4 groups when the risk scores are higher, and
there are few patients with low risk scores who are positive for
AR-V7. However, for patients with higher risk scores, there are
sufficient patient numbers in all treatment and AR-V7 groups
for between-group comparisons.
Toaddressthelowfrequencyofsamplesfrompatientswith
low-risk scores who are positive for AR-V7, patient classifica-
tion as either low risk or high risk was integrated into the
analysis. The classification was determined by dividing
the risk scores from the training cohort data in half.22 The
median risk score from the training cohort was –0.632. The
results showed that, for the subset of patients classified as
low risk within this data set, there were not enough patients
positive for AR-V7 to evaluate differences in the survival
rates between treatments stratified by biomarker result
(Figure 3A). In contrast, the Kaplan-Meier estimates of sur-
vival based on treatment and AR-V7 status among high-risk
patients provide a more discriminating picture (Figure 3B).
Here, the Cox proportional hazards regression model
showed that, for the high-risk patients negative for AR-V7,
those treated with ARS inhibitors had a longer median OS
than those treated with taxanes (16.9 vs 9.7 months; hazard
ratio, 2.38; 95% CI, 1.12-5.06; P = .02), and for the high-risk
patients positive for AR-V7, those receiving ARS inhibitors
had a shorter median OS than those receiving taxanes (5.6 vs
14.3 months; hazard ratio, 0.35; 95% CI, 0.14-0.88; P = .03).
Thus, for patients classified as high risk by existing clinical
biomarkers, a qualitative interaction exists, providing evi-
dence of the treatment choice more likely to benefit patients
with both AR-V7–negative and AR-V7–positive test results in
this group (Figure 3C). Flowcharts are provided for recom-
mended use of this test when the risk score is (Figure 4A) or
is not (Figure 4B) available.

 Discussion
The study results validate the clinical utility of the Epic Sci-
ences nuclear-localized AR-V7 assay to inform the choice
between ARS inhibitors or taxanes for patients with mCRPC
who are in need of a treatment change in the second-line or
greater therapy setting. Validation was established by per-
forming an independent, multicenter, cross-sectional retro-
spective-prospective study evaluating an analytically valid as-
say, in which the treatment decisions were made without
knowledge of and independent of AR-V7 status, the process-
ing laboratory was blinded to patient outcomes, and the
samples were analyzed using appropriate statistics with pre-
defined clinical end points.
Patients who tested negative for AR-V7 had better OS with
ARS inhibitors than with taxanes, whereas patients who tested
positive for AR-V7 had a demonstrated survival advantage
when treated with taxanes. This effect was most prominent
for patients classified as high risk, using conventional prog-
nostic factors for the mCRPC population. The validation and
demonstration of the clinical utility of nuclear-localized AR-V7
status in CTCs followed the path for biomarker development
by completing all steps in the analytic validation of the assay

 to show that it was fit for the purpose of rigorous clinical vali-
dation in which the assay result was studied to determine OS.
Emerging preclinical and clinical data in mCRPC suggest
that AR-V7 is only one mechanism of resistance to ARS inhibi-
tion that might exist between patients or within an individual
patient.9,26-28 Other mechanisms include mutations in the re-
ceptor, AR gene rearrangements, and alterations to AR-related
genes,proteins,andenzymesthatstimulateARsignaling.26,27,29
Nuclear-localized AR-V7 expression in CTCs is most often ob-
servedinonlyasubsetofCTCswithinapatientsample,22which
does not preclude the likelihood that multiple diverse mecha-
nisms may be present and concurrently contributing to the re-
sistant state. This finding is consistent with a recent report that
examined CTC phenotypic heterogeneity indices in the
same second-line or greater treatment decision context and
found that higher CTC heterogeneity was also associated
with superior outcomes with taxanes vs ARS inhibitors.28
Evidence of subclonal CTC genomics of AR-dependent and
AR-independentsignalingdriversco-occurringwithinthesame
patient sample were also observed in that study, further sup-
porting the concept that multiple mechanisms of resistance
co-occur. More important, additional biomarkers to further
stratifydifferentialsurvivalofpatientswithmCRPCbytherapy
areneededandshouldfollowasimilarstepwisevalidationpro-
cess as the nuclear-localized AR-V7 assay. Further validation
is ongoing.
Clinically, initiation of a second ARS inhibitor after pro-
gression on a previous ARS inhibitor has shown a shorter du-
ration of PSA responses than with the first-line therapy, with
most patients failing to demonstrate a decrease in PSA level.2,3
More recently, there have been cautionary studies against re-
liance on nonvalidated surrogate outcome measures in lieu of
OS.30 In the context of decisions about second-line or greater
mCRPC therapy, and despite the lack of decreases in PSA level
with ARS inhibition, many patients do have durable stable
disease. Given these objective data, the Prostate Cancer Clini-
calTrialsWorkingGroup3hasimplementedtheuseof“nolon-
ger clinically benefiting” as a metric to determine the contin-
ued overall benefit of a therapy despite the lack of a PSA
response as traditionally defined or in the setting of a slow in-
crease in PSA level after an initial decrease.23 More impor-
tant, for this AR-V7 analysis, the use of OS as the end point is
critical in understanding the ability of the biomarker to guide
treatment selection for this context of use, given the reduced
power of PSA to guide treatment selection in later lines of dis-
ease. Perhaps not surprisingly, ARS inhibition was associated
with superior OS compared with taxanes for patients with
AR-V7–negative disease.
Limitations
A limitation of this study is that patients were not prospec-
tively randomized to treatment based on the biomarker re-
sults, addressed in part through the use of risk scores in the
analysis to mitigate confounding between treatment and un-
derlying patient risk for which latent, unknown imbalances
might not be captured by the included features.
Conclusions
In the context of second-line or greater mCRPC clinical deci-
sions in which an ARS inhibitor is being considered, the use
of the Epic Sciences nuclear-localized AR-V7 test has demon-
strated clinical utility as an assay with OS as an end point. The
test should be considered for patients for whom increased OS
is an objective. For patients with many comorbidities or who
refuse a chemotherapeutic option, the AR-V7 test can still aid
in patient management by identifying ARS inhibition–
resistant disease for the purpose of directing patients to clini-
cal trials or palliative care.
