Summary
Model organisms subject to dietary restriction (DR) generally live
longer. Accompanying this lifespan extension are improvements
in overall health, based on multiple metrics. This indicates that
pharmacological treatments that mimic the effects of DR could
improve health in humans. To find new chemical structures that
extend lifespan, we screened 30 000 synthetic, diverse drug-like
chemicals in Caenorhabditis elegans and identified several struc-
turally related compounds that acted through DR mechanisms.
The most potent of these NP1 impinges upon a food perception
pathway by promoting glutamate signaling in the pharynx. This
results in the overriding of a GPCR pathway involved in the
perception of food and which normally acts to decrease gluta-
mate signals. Our results describe the activation of a dietary
restriction response through the pharmacological masking of a
novel sensory pathway that signals the presence of food. This
suggests that primary sensory pathways may represent novel
targets for human pharmacology.

Introduction
Aging is profoundly influenced by environmental factors such as
temperature, toxins, and nutrient availability. Sensory systems that detect
environmental stimulus mediate at least part of this influence on lifespan.
In the nematode C. elegans, as well as in D. melanogaster, the removal of
sensory neurons can modulate the lifespan of the organism (Apfeld &
Kenyon, 1999; Alcedo & Kenyon, 2004; Libert et al., 2007; Poon et al.,
2010; Ostojic et al., 2014). Recent work has also shown that sensory
signaling can also modulate the lifespan of vertebrates (Riera et al., 2014).
Progressive dysfunction and the breakdown of molecular pathways
that control homeostatic processes such as energy metabolism, protein
quality, and organismal growth have all been implicated in aging and
promoting the integrity of these systems can delay aging (Taylor & Dillin,
2011; Sahin & DePinho, 2012; Shore & Ruvkun, 2013). Alterations in
sensory neuron function can influence these processes in non-neuronal
tissues. For example, in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, the activity
of the AFD neurons is required for the induction of heat-shock genes in
multiplenon-neuronal tissues,demonstratingthat a stressresponsecritical
in promoting protein homeostasis (proteostasis) is under cell nonau-
tonomous neuronal control (Prahlad et al., 2008). Moreover, the unfolded
protein response of the endoplasmic reticulum (UPRER) and the mitochon-
dria (UPRmito) is also influenced by neuronal function (Durieux et al., 2011;
Sun et al., 2011; Singh & Aballay, 2012; Taylor & Dillin, 2013).
Perhaps the most well-studied environmental factor that influences
aging is nutrient availability. Dietary restriction is a robust means of
initiating a system-wide response that improves the efficiency of various
homeostatic cellular metrics, ameliorating stress and ultimately resulting
in lifespan extension. The DR response is highly conserved across
organisms. The effects of DR on lifespan have been known since the
1930s and for years people have sought chemical compounds that could
induce DR mechanisms (Ingram et al., 2006). The potential discovery of
DR mimetics has been compelling since the publication of the first such
candidate highlighted the potential for obtaining the advantages
associated with DR, namely improved physiology, without having to
adopt a restrictive and dissatisfying diet (Lane et al., 1998).
Dietary restriction can be elicited by altering nutrient signals. For
example, chemical structures that mimic dietary components, endoge-
nous metabolites, and perturbation of specific neurotransmitter path-
ways have all been shown to shift organismal physiology into a DR state
(Petrascheck et al., 2007; Williams et al., 2009; Lucanic et al., 2011; Chin
et al., 2014). Dietary restriction is also influenced by sensory perception,
and primary sensory neurons have been shown to be integral to achieving
the DR response to low nutrients (Bishop & Guarente, 2007).
Caenorhabditis elegans has proved to be a good model organism for
the discovery of chemical compounds and plant extracts that modulate
aging (Collins et al., 2006; Lucanic et al., 2013a; Carretero et al., 2015).
In an effort to identify novel modulators of DR, we have undertaken small-
molecule screens in C. elegans to identify new chemical structures that
can delay aging. Here, we describe one such novel chemical, NP1, and
outline its mechanism of action. NP1 interacts with a sensory pathway
that informs on nutrient availability in C. elegans. We find that NP1
promotes glutamatergic signaling through a glutamate-gated chloride
channel and that this mimics the loss of a muscarinic acetylcholine signal
which normally functions to inhibit this pathway when food is abundant.
These results demonstrate that chemical modulation of nutrient sensory
pathways can illicit organism-wide physiological responses associated
with dietary restriction even in the presence of a normal diet.

 drug-like compounds for lifespan extension in the free-living nematode
C. elegans (Fig. S1). We identified over five hundred primary hits, of
which one hundred and eighty were selected for re-testing. Re-testing of
the compounds was performed in triplicate and was re-arrayed in 96-
well assay plates to help mitigate positional plate effects. Binning of the
re-test results indicated that the primary hits from the chemical screen
outperformed control wells (Fig. S1). Top hits from the re-test assay were
tested under standard C. elegans culture conditions (single plate). While
most of the 57 identified chemicals that reproducibly induced lifespan
extension were structurally diverse, three were closely related. These
compounds all contained a nitrophenyl piperazine backbone (Fig. 1A),
and they were therefore named nitrophenyl piperazine-containing
compounds 1–3 (NP1-3). NP1 was determined to be the most potent
of these compounds inducing a robust lifespan extension regardless of
whether exposure was initiated just prior to hatching (Fig. 1B) or at the
young adult stage (Fig. 1C). NP1 exhibited a dose–response effect on
lifespan that peaked at 50 lM (Fig. 1D).
NP1 acted through a DR-type mechanism
Caenorhabditis elegans are bacterivores and are generally cultured on
living bacteria. Recent research in C. elegans has highlighted the
impact of the metabolism of the bacterial food as contributing to the
effect of chemical treatments intended only for the worms (Onken &
Driscoll, 2010; Cabreiro et al., 2013). To determine whether the
metabolic activity of the bacterial food was at all causative to the NP1
effect, we tested NP1 on worms cultured on bacteria pretreated with
ultraviolet radiation (UV) (Fig. 1E). Under these conditions, NP1 was
still effective at prolonging lifespan relative to untreated animals,
demonstrating that NP1 effect did not require metabolically active
bacteria.
To begin to determine the mechanism of the lifespan extension
induced by NP1, we first tested whether it acted through the
pathways known to influence lifespan in C. elegans. DAF-16, the
transcription factor effector of insulin-/IGF-like signaling, was not
required for the effect of NP1, as null mutants still responded to NP1
with lifespan extension relative to control-treated animals (Fig. 2A).
Mutants or RNAi of other major stress-response transcription factors
(HSF-1 and SKN-1) that are known to mediate lifespan extension also
showed lifespan extension from the addition of NP1 compared to
nontreated controls. hsf-1 mutants and hsf-1 RNAi-treated animals
both responded well to NP1, while skn-1 RNAi-treated animals

 these results is less clear as these genes are essential for viability, and
thus, only hypomorphic alleles and/or RNAi treatments were assayed.
RNAi results additionally require careful interpretation because some
tissues, including neurons, are known to respond poorly, leading to
possible tissue-specific effects resulting from mosaic or incomplete
knockdown of the target. Because of these caveats, our results
cannot completely exclude these two genes from being involved in
the response to NP1. NP1 also further extended the lifespan of a
long-lived mitochondrial mutant (isp-1) (Fig. 2D). However, NP1 failed
to extend the lifespan of worms fed dsRNA of the FOXA-type
transcription factor pha-4 (Fig. 4E). Because PHA-4 was previously
identified as being required for the lifespan-extending effects of DR,
this suggested that NP1 may elicit DR (Panowski et al., 2007). To
further test this, we conducted assays with NP1 in a dietary restriction
protocol that directly limits the bacterial food available. We observed
a lifespan response to food concentrations on a level with previously
reported values (Chen et al., 2009). NP1 was effective at extending
lifespan in conditions of food abundance, but not under strong DR
conditions (Fig. 2F). The dependence on high food concentrations for

that

promoting a DR response.
NP1 decreased the pharyngeal muscle contraction frequency
through glutamatergic signaling
There are many ways of eliciting the DR response, from directly reducing
food intake to activating the downstream pathways that cause the
physiological changes that promote extended lifespan. We first tested
whether NP1 influenced feeding (and therefore food intake) by
measuring the pharyngeal muscle pumping rates. Caenorhabditis
elegans are bacterivores that feed by pumping their pharyngeal muscles,
which draw food into the pharyngeal lumen. This food is then ground up
and passed on to the intestine (Avery & Horvitz, 1989). NP1-treated
animals showed a subtle but significant reduction in pumping rate
relative to control-treated animals (Fig. S2). Maximum effect was
observed after 3 h and was similar in acute or chronically treated
animals (Fig. S2). We also tested the effect of the chemical in an in vitro
assay with dissected heads and found a similar inhibitory effect on
pumping which started at lower concentrations. Because the dissected
head assay removes the cuticle, a likely barrier to chemical entry, this
result suggests that the in vivo concentration of the compound in our
standard 50 lM assays is likely to be in the nanomolar to low micromolar
range (Fig. S2).

 Despite the decrease in average feeding rates, we were unable to
detect significant differences in food intake between NP1-treated and
control worms (Fig. S2). As NP1 did not appear to decrease feeding rate
in vivo and did not cause worms to appear starved or poorly fed, we
thought it unlikely that the NP1 pumping rate defect could cause such a
profound increase in lifespan. Genetic mutations that result in DR from
mechanical impairments of feeding are well known in C. elegans
(Lakowski & Hekimi, 1998). EAT-2 is an acetylcholine receptor subunit
responsible for promoting the rapid pumping of pharyngeal muscle
(Raizen et al., 1995; McKay et al., 2004). eat-2 mutants exhibited
profoundly decreased pumping rates, appeared starved, and were long-
lived relative to wild-type (Fig. 3A). We found that, despite the much
greater effect of the eat-2 mutation on pumping rates, the mutation did
not confer a greater magnitude of lifespan extension than NP1
treatment. Furthermore, treating the eat-2-mutant worms with NP1
resulted in an additive lifespan extension; the effects on pumping were
also additive (Fig. 3A,B). Collectively, these results indicated that the
longevity effect of NP1 did not simply result from limiting nutrient intake
through a decreased feeding rate.
Pharyngeal pumping is a well-studied neuromuscular activity that
consists of the isolated pharyngeal-specific nervous system controlling
the pharyngeal muscle network which is collectively linked through gap
junctions (Franks et al., 2006; Avery & You, 2012). The system utilizes
several distinct neurotransmitter pathways. To determine whether NP1
was acting through the modulation of a specific neurotransmitter
signaling pathway, we tested a panel of neurotransmission mutants. We
found that mutants completely devoid of glutamatergic signaling,
through the loss of the glutamate transporter (EAT-4) required for
loading glutamate into synaptic vesicles (Lee et al., 1999), failed to
respond to the chemical (Figs 3C,D and S2), while mutants defective in
other implicated pathways, such as cholinergic, serotonergic, and
neuropeptide signaling, all responded to NP1 with a reduction in
pumping rate (Fig. 3C). We found that similar to glutamatergic null
mutants, the pharyngeal muscle-specific glutamate receptor mutant avr-
15 (Dent et al., 1997) also failed to respond to NP1 (Fig. 3D). These
results demonstrate that the decreased pumping rate effect of NP1
requires glutamatergic neurotransmission to the pharyngeal muscle.
NP1 promotes glutamatergic signaling through the
glutamate-gated chloride channel AVR-15
The major function of glutamatergic signaling in the pharyngeal nervous
system is through the M3 neurons that drive the inhibitory postsynaptic
potentials (IPSPs) that facilitate re-polarization of the pharyngeal muscle
(Avery, 1993; Raizen & Avery, 1994). These IPSPs (P spikes) can be
visualized in the electrophysiological traces of neuromuscular function,
which are known as electropharyngeograms (EPGs) (Fig. 3E). The
glutamate-gated chloride channel AVR-15 is expressed in the pharyngeal
muscle and is absolutely required for these IPSPs (Dent et al., 1997). To
test whether NP1 activates or inhibits signaling through AVR-15, we
utilized the NeuroChip microfluidic device (Hu et al., 2013) to record
EPGs and examine the effects of NP1 on these IPSPs. If NP1 inhibits
glutamate signaling through AVR-15, then we would predict that NP1
would suppress P spikes; if NP1 promotes signaling, we would expect to
observe more P spikes. Significantly more P spikes per action potential
were recorded in NP1-treated animals than in the control-treated
animals (Fig. 3F). Consistent with previous observations, we did not
detect P spike-type IPSPs in either eat-4 or avr-15 mutants. Additionally,
we did not detect a significant difference in the number of P spikes per
action potential in NP1-treated eat-4 or avr-15 mutants relative to the
control-treated animals. Collectively, these data indicate that NP1
promotes signaling through AVR-15 in the pharyngeal muscle.
NP1-induced longevity also requires glutamatergic signals to
the pharyngeal muscles
We next tested whether the longevity effect of NP1 also required
functional glutamatergic signaling. Indeed, both glutamatergic null
animals (eat-4) and the pharyngeal muscle glutamate receptor mutants
(avr-15) failed to respond to NP1 with lifespan extension (Fig. 4A,B).
This also demonstrated that the loss of glutamatergic signaling did not
extend lifespan relative to wild-type controls (Fig. 4A,B). This was
surprising because these glutamatergic mutants exhibited a stronger
pumping
rate
decrease
than
the
NP1-treated
animals
(Fig. 3D).
Collectively, these results show that the relatively minor reduction in
pumping rate associated with a loss of glutamatergic signaling is not
sufficient to extend lifespan. This finding supports our previous
observations that the decrease in pumping rate observed in NP1-
treated animals is unlikely to be causative for the lifespan extension.
However, an alternative explanation for the lack of extended lifespan in
glutamatergic mutants, whether or not NP1 is present, could be that
glutamatergic mutants are generally defective in their response to DR.
To test this possibility, we examined the lifespan of eat-4- and avr-15-
mutant populations cultured with variable food concentrations. This
was not the case, because both mutant populations showed a robust
lifespan extension response to DR (Fig. S3). Taken together, our results
indicate that glutamatergic signals are not absolutely required for DR,
yet can be utilized to promote DR, supporting the existence of
redundant DR activation pathways.
The results from our lifespan analysis indicate that NP1 requires
glutamatergic signaling to the pharyngeal muscle but does not simply
act through inhibiting these signals. This is complementary to the
electrophysiological analysis of NP1-treated worms, which suggested
that NP1 acted through promoting glutamatergic signaling to the
pharyngeal muscle. To further test this hypothesis, we utilized an eat-4-
mutant background and ectopically expressed EAT-4 in a pair of
nonglutamatergic motor neurons that synapse onto the pharyngeal
muscle (the NSMs). Expression of EAT-4 in a neuron is the defining
feature of a glutamatergic neuron (Serrano-Saiz et al., 2013) and is
therefore expected to be sufficient to cause the loading of glutamate
into endogenous synaptic vesicles for release onto the pharyngeal
muscle. Furthermore, NSM neurons are not required for the lifespan-
extending effect of NP1 (Fig. S3). We found that expression of EAT-4 in
the NSMs had a relatively weak and variable effect on lifespan but that it
resulted in rescued sensitivity to the lifespan-extending effects of the
chemical NP1, which is lost in eat-4 mutants (Fig. 4A,C,D). This result
again indicated that NP1 acted to increase lifespan through an increased
glutamatergic signaling to the pharyngeal muscle, regardless of the
neural origin of the glutamate signal, and further suggested that NP1
likely acts downstream of the M3 neurons.
Mutations in the M1/M3/M5-type muscarinic acetylcholine
receptor gar-3 mimic the lifespan effects, but not the
pumping effect of NP1
NP1 activates a DR effect on lifespan by increasing glutamatergic
signaling to the pharyngeal muscle. This suggested that NP1 may
impinge on a sensory pathway involved in nutrient detection, perhaps by
mimicking a signaling state that occurs in situations of low food
abundance. The metabotropic-type acetylcholine receptor GAR-3 has

 been reported to have dual roles in the pharyngeal muscle contraction
(Steger & Avery, 2004) and has also been shown to be involved in
starvation signaling (You et al., 2006). We found that gar-3 mutants
[including the nonsense allele gar-3(gk305)] were long-lived relative to
wild-type and they failed to respond to NP1 with a further lifespan
extension (Figs 4E and S3). This result is consistent with NP1 acting by
inhibiting or phenocopying an inhibited GAR-3. Interestingly, we found
that gar-3 mutants responded to NP1 with decreased pumping,
demonstrating that the lifespan and pumping phenotypes of NP1 can
be dissociated (Fig. S3).
Recently, several reports have described the important roles for GAR-
3 in neurons, mediating multiple roles in acetylcholine signaling,

expression in the terminal bulb of the pharynx. To test whether GAR-3
was acting in neuronal or muscle tissue, we expressed GAR-3 in the

compared to gar-3 control) (E). Tissue-specific expression of gar-3 in the pharyngeal muscle (rfex224[Pmyo-2::gar-3]) was sufficient to rescue the NP1 response (P = 0.0002
compared to gar-3; rfEx224 control) (F), while the NTS did not respond to NP1 with lifespan extension (P = 0.5596 compared to gar-3 NTS control treated) (G). eat-4 was

 muscle expression of GAR-3 was sufficient to restore the response to
NP1 (Fig. 4F,G).
As we had identified two signaling pathways with different lifespan
phenotypes (eat-4 and gar-3), which were linked by their failure to
respond to NP1 with lifespan extension, we next examined the order of
these mutants by analyzing the lifespan phenotype of the double
mutants. We found that the eat-4;gar-3 double mutants had the short
lifespan phenotype of the eat-4 single mutants and not the long lifespan
phenotype of the gar-3 single mutants (Fig. 4H). This demonstrates that
eat-4 is epistatic to gar-3 and therefore acts further downstream in the
linked pathway. Collectively, our results demonstrate that NP1 extends
lifespan in a DR-like manner by promoting glutamatergic signals to the
pharyngeal muscle. In the absence of NP1, this response is likely
regulated through acetylcholine signaling by the metabotropic-type
acetylcholine receptor GAR-3 (Fig. 5).
Discussion
The detection of nutrients through primary sensory neurons is an
important component of dietary restriction in metazoans, and it may
represent an attractive target for pharmaceuticals in eliciting DR in
animals on a normal diet. Sensory perception pathways allow for the
rapid response of an organism to an external stimulus. These systems
may lead to more rapid responses to changing food environments than
secondary pathways such as cellular detection of energy levels or the
detection of absorbed dietary components and their levels. Primary
sensory systems have the advantage pharmacologically of being more
specific targets than intracellular energy detection pathways such as
mTOR or AMPK. External or primary sensory systems seem to be geared
toward specific stimuli, while intracellular components tend toward
being utilized as nodes that respond to multiple stimulus and cellular
conditions.
We suggest that the GAR-3/AVR-15 pathway described here is part of
a primary sensory system that detects food availability in C. elegans. We
found that NP1 acts through DR to extend lifespan (Fig. 2F) and that a
profile of the DR response is shifted toward higher food concentrations
in the presence of NP1, suggesting an attenuated food perception. GAR-
3 loss-of-function mutants also show extended lifespan and are not
further extended by NP1 (Figs 4E and S3). This indicates that GAR-3
signaling negatively regulates the DR pathway promoted by NP1. GAR-3,
which we link to DR and has previously been shown to be important in
responding to nutrient conditions (You et al., 2006), has also been
shown to act as an extrasynaptic detector of acetylcholine levels (Chan
et al., 2013). Our model to fit these observations suggests that food
abundance induces an increased acetylcholine, which is detected by
GAR-3 on the pharyngeal muscles (Fig. 5). This is consistent with the fact
that acetylcholine is the primary excitatory neurotransmitter that
influences the pace of feeding.
This model of acetylcholine monitoring at the pharyngeal muscle
explains the additive effect on lifespan observed between the eat-2
mutation and NP1 (Fig. 3A). eat-2 mutants are not expected to have
decreased acetylcholine levels and are only defective for the response to
acetylcholine. This model, however, does not explain the significance of
the interaction between GAR-3 and AVR-15. Why should a muscarinic-
type receptor require a chloride channel to have a physiological effect?
This is still not clear. Previous work has highlighted a complex role for
GAR-3 in regulating multiple activities of the pharyngeal muscle,
including calcium ion dynamics and membrane re-polarization timing
in pharyngeal muscle (Steger & Avery, 2004). However, muscarinic-type
receptors are well known to control ion channel function in vertebrate
Fig. 5 Model of the nutrient detection signaling pathway antagonized by NP1. (A–C) A model of the different pharyngeal muscle signaling states described. (A) When food
is abundant, pharyngeal cholinergic neurons (shown in red) are highly active and release acetylcholine. The high levels of acetylcholine result in activation of the
metabotropic acetylcholine receptor GAR-3. GAR-3 inhibits signaling through the glutamate-gated chloride channel, and this signaling suppresses DR. (B) When food is
scarce, acetylcholine levels are low and do not activate GAR-3. High signaling through AVR-15 then elicits a DR response. (C) NP1 addition promotes signaling through AVR-
15 and this elicits DR even in the presence of abundant food by masking or inhibiting the effect of GAR-3. Green ovals represent AVR-15, and blue circles represent GAR-3.
Pink neurons represent the M3 neurons, while pink hexagons represent glutamate. The red neuron represents cholinergic neurons (a single neuron is shown for clarity), while
red stars represent acetylcholine.

 cells (Pfaffinger et al., 1985; Shi et al., 2004), including heart muscle
that shares remarkable similarities with nematode pharyngeal muscle
(Mango, 2007). Our lifespan data demonstrate that the loss of GAR-3
muscarinic receptor signaling and the chemical NP1 act through the ion
channel AVR-15. However, the effect on pumping from these two
different manipulations are distinct, because NP1 reduces pumping
significantly while we could not detect a significant difference in
pumping rate between wild-type and gar-3 mutants (Fig. S3). This
indicates that while the effect of removing gar-3 results in a relatively
subtle increase in the activity of AVR-15, NP1 administration has a much
more profound effect on the channel. Thus, a subtle increase in AVR-15
function is sufficient to induce the DR response, while a strong AVR-15
increase in activity causes an additional effect on pumping rate.
The specificity of the NP1 effect on lifespan as requiring avr-15 and
mimicking gar-3 mutants suggests that NP1 acts through specific
interaction with a single molecule or molecular complex and rather than
having multiple targets. NP1-3 all contain a piperazine domain (Fig. 1),
and piperazine itself has long been known to be a weak agonist of
GABA-type chloride channels, which themselves are related to gluta-
mate-gated chloride ion channels. We have tested the effects of
piperazine on pharyngeal pumping and lifespan and did not observe the
effects that were similar to NP1 (data not shown). High doses of
piperazine did inhibit pumping, but general paralysis was the most
apparent phenotype with piperazine at millimolar concentrations.
Paralysis was not observed from NP1 treatment, and additive experi-
ments seemed to indicate that they do not enhance each other’s effects,
suggesting distinct mechanisms. There are a large number of other
pharmacologically active piperazine-containing molecules, some of
which are involved in promoting or inhibiting monoamine signaling, as
well as other biological pathways. Further analysis is needed to
determine the exact molecular target of NP1.
Chemical screens can uncover the modulators of aging not identified
in genetic screens. Here, we show that a screening of diverse, synthetic
compounds for lifespan extension reveals a novel nutrient sensing
pathway. While the specificity of the sensory system targeted by NP1
suggests that this chemical is perhaps unlikely to alter nutrient detection
in mammals, recent work has shown that sensory systems are at play in
regulating mammalian longevity and that they are not restricted to
nutrient perception (Riera et al., 2014). Our work further demonstrates
that there are likely to be many potential targets for the development of
drug-like mimetics of diet restriction.
Materials and methods
Caenorhabditis elegans culture conditions and strains
Nematodes were maintained as previously described (Brenner, 1974).
The following previously described strains and alleles were used in this
study: N2; gar-3(gk305); gar-3(vu78); daf-16(mu86); hsf-1(sy441); isp-1
(qm150); osm-3(p802); eat-18(ad1110); tph-1(mg280); ser-7(tm1325);
unc-31(e928); eat-2(ad1116); eat-4(ky5); eat-4(ad819); avr-15(ad1051);
TJ1060[spe-9 (hc88);fer-15(b26)]; zdIs13[Ptph-1::GFP].
Generation of transgenic Caenorhabditis elegans lines
To obtain worm lines that express EAT-4 in the NSM motor neurons, we
used polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to isolate the promoter region of
tph-1 (primers f1: ccacttgagcttttccactgatcaacc and r1: atgattgaagagag-
caatgctacctaaaaaccaaag) and the eat-4 coding region (primers f1:
CAAGCCTCGTTCCATGACGACAT and r1: ctggtagaaaagcagaggagaa
gaaggc); these DNA fragments were then fused by PCR (any overlap
region of primers is omitted for clarity) and injected into the gonads of
young adult hermaphrodites (Hobert, 2002). Individual progeny of these
injected animals were used to find transgenic lines, three of which were
selected for further study (rfEx228-230) based on the expression of a co-
injection marker.
To obtain the pharyngeal-specific expression of GAR-3, the above
strategy was again employed using the promoter from myo-2 (primers
f1: ggtggtggacagtaactgtctgt and r1: ttctgtgtctgacgatcgagg) and the
gar-3 genomic region (primer f1: cagtcctcttcgttggggaatgctg and r1:
gacatgggcgacttcttaatacagatgttctcaaaca). Again using microinjection,
two transgenic lines were obtained for further study (rfEx224-225).
Lifespan assays
Regular lifespan assays (non-multiwell, high-throughput, or automated
lifespan machine based) were performed as previously described
(Lucanic et al., 2013b). In brief, synchronized (from 2-h egg lays) worm
populations were added to 3 cM NGM plates supplemented with 10 lg/
mL 5-fluoro-20-deoxyuridine (FUdR) at day one of adulthood. Animals
were scored and transferred to fresh plates every other day through the
first two weeks, with weekly transfers after the first two weeks. Lifespan
assays were performed at 20 °C. Feeding RNAi lifespans were performed
as described above except that worms were shifted to and then
maintained on RNAi plates (NGM supplemented with 100 lg/mL +
400 lM IPTG) containing bacteria expressing the specific RNAi vector or
the control vector (L4440) on day one of adulthood.
For multiwell assays (re-test assay), TJ1060 animals were used (no
FUdR) and incubated at 25 °C from hatching. Three of the control plates
were scored at days 14, 16, and 18 of adulthood. At day 18, we
discovered approximately 95% mortality on the scored control plates. All
other plates (control and test) were then completely scored for mortality.
Automated lifespan machine assays were performed essentially as
previously described (Stroustrup et al., 2013) except for the timing of
FUdR addition, amount of FUdR, and the point at which they were
loaded onto the scanners. Specifically, worms were loaded onto the
scanners for lifespan analysis at day four of adulthood after initiating
FUdR treatment (10 lg/mL) at day one of adulthood and transferred to
fresh FUdR-containing plates on day two and day four of adulthood.
These modifications were made in order to delay FUdR treatment until
after somatic development was complete, to minimize FUdR levels in the
experiment, and to avoid moving larva to the scanner plates. For all
lifespan analyses, comparisons of survival were made with GraphPad
Prism
TM software, and P values were generated by the log-rank Whitney
test of significance.
Chemical screen for enhanced lifespan
For the high-throughput screen cultures, ten mass culture plates (10 cM
NGM with concentrated OP50) with approximately 25 000 gravid
TJ1060 animals were collected in S basal. These plates were treated
with a hypochlorite solution and then washed three times and incubated
at low density in S basal for 16 h in glass dishes. Resulting L1 arrested
worms were resuspended at one worm/microliter in S basal. The worms
were then dispensed into 96-well plates containing NGM and concen-
trated OP50 at ten worms per well with a Multidrop 384 reagent
dispenser (Thermo Scientific). The plates were then incubated for 48 h at
25 °C to reach adulthood. Chemicals were then dispensed onto each
well to a final concentration of 50 lM with a Biomek FX Liquid Handler
(Beckman Coulter). The plates were then dried in a sterile hood and then

 incubated at 25 °C until control plates exhibited 95–100% mortality
(18–21 days). The plates were scored manually with a stereomicroscope.
Chemical treatment of Caenorhabditis elegans
For standard assays, chemicals were added to food-containing (OP50
bacteria) 3 cm culture plates (standard NGM agar) at least one day
prior to use to allow for distribution of the chemical throughout the
culture plate. DMSO concentrations in NP1 assays were kept at
0.25%, except for screening assays that contained DMSO at 0.53%.
DMSO levels were always matched in control experiments. Unless
otherwise stated, chemical treatment was initiated on 1st day of
adulthood and maintained throughout the entire lifespan. NP1-treated
worms appeared healthy and well fed with no obvious abnormalities
other than a slight (6- to 12-h) developmental delay observed when
worms were hatched in the presence of the chemical (data not
shown).
Pharyngeal pumping rate measurements
Unless otherwise stated, feeding behavior in chemical-treated animals
was assayed in second-day adults, after 24 h of chemical treatment
starting on the first day of adulthood. For chemical treatments, the
worms were incubated with chemical and then moved onto a standard
food-containing culture plate for five minutes prior to measurements.
Pumping rates were either counted in real time over 30 s or were first
captured in 10-s videos and then later scored by counting the pharyngeal
contractions in playback at one-quarter speed. The specific method used
in each experiment is indicated in the figure legend. At least 20 animals
were tested for each genotype and condition. Student’s t-test was used
to determine the P values.
Electrophysiology
Electropharyngeogram (EPG) recordings were carried out with whole
animals in the NeuroChip microfluidic device as previously described (Hu
et al., 2013). Briefly, the worms were placed in the device in Dent’s
solution supplemented with 5 mM 5-HT (to stimulate pumping) and
recorded for 2–5 min. Recorded EPG traces were analyzed using the
AutoEPG software (Dillon et al., 2009), which annotates and compiles
individual features of the traces such as P spikes. Two-way ANOVA
within GraphPad Prism
TM software was used to test significance.
Laser ablation
Laser ablation was performed essentially as previously described (Fang-
Yen et al., 2012). Briefly, arrested first larval-stage animals were
mounted on microscope slides with 2% agarose pads and anesthetized
with 5 mM sodium azide. Laser ablation was performed with a
micropoint system running a dye-pumped laser system with a nanosec-
ond-range pulse rate. Targeted cells were identified by the expression of
fluorescent markers and were confirmed as ablated 48 h after surgery by
the lack of fluorescence signals.
