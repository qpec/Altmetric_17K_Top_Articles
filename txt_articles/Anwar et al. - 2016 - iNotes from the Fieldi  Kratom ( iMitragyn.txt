Kratom (Mitragyna speciosa) Exposures Reported 
to Poison Centers — United States, 2010–2015
Mehruba Anwar, MD1; Royal Law, PhD1; Josh Schier, MD1
Kratom (Mitragyna speciosa) is a plant consumed throughout 
the world for its stimulant effects and as an opioid substitute 
(1). It is typically brewed into a tea, chewed, smoked, or 
ingested in capsules (2). It is also known as Thang, Kakuam, 
Thom, Ketum, and Biak (3). The Drug Enforcement 
Administration includes kratom on its Drugs of Concern list 
(substances that are not currently regulated by the Controlled 
Substances Act, but that pose risks to persons who abuse them), 
and the National Institute of Drug Abuse has identified kratom 
as an emerging drug of abuse (3,4). Published case reports 
have associated kratom exposure with psychosis, seizures, and 
deaths (5,6). Because deaths have been attributed to kratom 
in the United States (7), some jurisdictions have passed or are 
considering legislation to make kratom use a felony (8). CDC 
characterized kratom exposures that were reported to poison 
centers and uploaded to the National Poison Data System 
(NPDS) during January 2010–December 2015. The NPDS 
is a national database of information logged by the country’s 
regional poison centers serving all 50 United States, the 
District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico and is maintained by 
the American Association of Poison Control Centers. NPDS 
case records are the result of call reports made by the public 
and health care providers.
During the study period, U.S. poison centers received 660 
calls about reported exposure to kratom. The number of calls 
increased tenfold from 26 in 2010 to 263 in 2015 (Figure). 
Health care provider reports constituted 496 (75.2%) of calls. 
Among calls, 487 (73.8%) exposed persons reported inten-
tional exposure, and 595 (90.2%) reported ingestion of the 
drug. Isolated kratom exposure (single exposure) was reported 
in 428 (64.8%) cases. Among calls reporting use of kratom in 
combination with other substances (multiple exposures), the 
most commonly reported other substances were ethanol, other 
botanicals, benzodiazepines, narcotics, and acetaminophen. 
Among 658 (99.7%) calls for which information on sex of 
the exposed person was available, 472 (71.7%) were male, and 
among 604 (91.5%) for which information on age was avail-
able, the median age was 28 years (range = 2 months–69 years).
Medical outcomes associated with kratom exposure were 
reported as minor (minimal signs or symptoms, which resolved 
rapidly with no residual disability) for 162 (24.5%) exposures, 
moderate (non-life threatening, with no residual disability, but 
requiring some form of treatment) for 275 (41.7%) exposures, 
and major (life-threatening signs or symptoms, with some 
residual disability) for 49 (7.4%) exposures. One death was 
reported in a person who was exposed to the medications par-
oxetine (an antidepressant) and lamotrigine (an anticonvulsant 
and mood stabilizer) in addition to kratom. For 173 (26.2%) 
exposure calls, no effects were reported, or poison center staff 
members were unable to follow up again regarding effects. 
Among exposed persons for whom information on signs and 
symptoms was available, reported signs and symptoms included 
tachycardia (n = 165, 25.0%), agitation or irritability (157, 
23.8%), drowsiness (128, 19.4%), nausea (97, 14.7%), and 
hypertension (77, 11.7%). A chi-square test demonstrated a 
significant association between severity of outcome and mul-
tiple versus single exposures (p<0.001). Pairwise comparisons 
(adjusted by the stepdown Bonferroni procedure) indicated a 
higher likelihood of a report of a severe outcome among per-
sons aged 21–30 years (p = 0.04), 31–40 years (p = 0.02), and 
>40 years (p = 0.02) compared with persons aged 0–10 years.
Kratom use appears to be increasing in the United States (2), 
and the reported medical outcomes and health effects suggest 
an emerging public health threat. Members of the public and 
health care providers should be aware that the use of kratom 
can lead to severe adverse effects, especially when consumed 
in combination with alcohol or other drugs.
