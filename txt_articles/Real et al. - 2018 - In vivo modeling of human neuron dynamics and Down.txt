Abstract 
Harnessing the potential of human stem cells for modelling the physiology and diseases of 
cortical circuitry requires monitoring cellular dynamics in vivo. Here, we show that human 
iPSC-derived cortical neurons transplanted in the adult mouse cortex consistently organized 
in large (up to ~100 mm3) vascularized neuron-glia territories with complex cytoarchitecture. 
Longitudinal imaging of >4000 grafted developing human neurons revealed that neuronal 
arbors refined via branch-specific retraction; human synaptic networks substantially 
restructured over 4 months, with balanced rates of synapse formation and elimination; 
oscillatory population activity mirrored the patterns of fetal neural networks. Finally, we 
found increased synaptic stability and reduced oscillations in transplants from two 
individuals with Down syndrome, demonstrating the potential of in vivo imaging in human 
tissue grafts for patient-specific modelling of cortical development, physiology and 
pathogenesis.

Cellular analyses in the human brain are restricted mainly to post-mortem material, which 
cannot provide direct observation of dynamic events such as anatomical refinement (1) and 
the emergence of complex patterns of network activity. This limitation raises the question of 
how to model human neuron dynamics and their dysfunction in the many incurable disorders 
that affect the developing cortex (2). 
Rodent models have been valuable to the understanding of the pathophysiology of complex 
genetic disorders such as Down syndrome (3-5), which is associated with 
neurodevelopmental alterations and is caused by trisomy of chromosome 21 (Ts21), but 
certain phenotypes are better captured in the context of a human genetic background (6).  
Human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived neurons can be used in patient-
specific studies to model human cortical development (7), but in vitro 2D and 3D cultures 
(8, 9) lack key interactions with neuroglia and vasculature (10). There is an urgent need, 
therefore, to develop systems that more closely recapitulate the complex cellular dynamics 
of the living brain using patient-specific cells.  
Building on previous transplantation work (11), we hypothesized that the existing 
physiological microenvironment in the adult mouse brain could support the expansion of 
human cortical tissue grafts from iPSC-derived neurons, thus allowing high-resolution, real-
time in vivo monitoring of human neuron dynamics for extended periods of time.  
Here, we used single-cell-resolution intravital microscopy (12) in human tissue grafts to gain 
insights into the dynamics of pruning, synaptogenesis and network activity during the 
earliest stages of cortical neuron development and demonstrated this approach by 
modelling human neuron structural and functional dynamics in Down syndrome.

Complex cytoarchitecture in human cortical tissue grafts  
In order to study the dynamics of human axon and synaptic development and population 
activity in vivo, we generated cortical excitatory neurons from a control human iPSC line 
(13) (fig. S1) and transplanted them in the adult mouse somatosensory cortex (SCx1) for 
chronic multiphoton imaging (fig. 1A). Cells were transplanted after 36-38 days of 
differentiation, a stage at which cultures contained ~ 50% neural progenitor cells and ~ 50% 
deep layer cortical neurons (of which ~ 15% were T-box, Brain 1 (TBR1)+ and ~ 85% 
transcription factor interacting protein 2 (CTIP2)+, fig. S2A-B). As expected, and consistent 
with ongoing neurogenesis after engraftment, upper layer cortical excitatory neurons and a 
small proportion of astrocytes and oligodendrocytes could also be found both at 3 and 5 
months post-transplantation (mpt) (fig. S2C-D). Electron microscopy confirmed that human 
grafts resembled immature cortical tissue at 130 days post-transplantation (dpt) (fig. S3A-
C), with few synapses and few myelinated axons, and showed no detectable boundary with 
the mouse brain (fig. S3C), suggestive of structural integration (14). Importantly, the grafts 
contained proliferating cells (fig. S3C-D), enlarged in size (movie S1), and consisted of 
multiple human- and host-derived cell types (fig. S2, S3). The cell types from the host 
included microglial cells, oligodendrocytes, astrocytes and both excitatory neurons and 
inhibitory interneurons (fig. S3, D, E and F), while no interneurons of human origin were 
found (n = 3 transplants). Microglia recruitment in the graft was minimal (fig. S4). Post-
mortem analysis revealed that the human tissue grafts developed organizational features

resembling the structural arrangement of the early fetal cortex (fig. S5)(15, 16).  
At earlier stages (< 2 mpt), cortical tissue grafts contained areas with ventricular zone-like 
territories, with cells positive for Paired box protein 6 (PAX6), a marker of neuronal 
progenitors, and Nestin, a marker for radial glia, which extended processes both radially 
outwards from the core of the rosette-like structures (fig. S5A), and arranged in parallel (fig. 
S5B), mimicking the organization of radial fibers in the intermediate zone of the human fetal 
cortex (15). Ki67-expressing proliferating cells were found in the inner apical layer, with 
doublecortin (DXC)-positive immature neurons towards its basal part, extending out into the 
rest of the graft (16) (fig. S5A). After 2 mpt, the rosettes did not persist and, although discrete 
cortical laminae were not clearly visible, consistent with the fact they form in late embryonic 
development (around 7-month post-conception) (17), immunostaining for deep and upper 
layer cortical neurons with antibodies for TBR1 and Special AT-rich sequence-binding 
protein 2 (SATB2), respectively, showed that these cell populations can segregate in vivo 
(fig. S5C). Human astrocytes were homogenously distributed in the cortical tissue grafts (fig. 
S5D). Finally, human tissue grafts were vascularized as shown in vivo and by the endothelial 
marker cluster of differentiation 31 (CD31) (Fig. 1, B, C and D), suggesting that the adult 
mouse brain microenvironment can support the development of a multicellular transplant.  
 
Human axon pruning imaged in vivo  
In order to track human neurons in vivo, we engineered them to express GFP via lentiviral-
mediated transduction prior to transplantation. Human neurons were present for the duration 
of our experimental time-course, which spanned up to 6 months, and spread away from the 
injection site (Fig. 1B, on average up to 1.2 ± 0.6 mm (mean ± SD) from bregma in the

rostral direction over the first 3 mpt (n = 4 mice)). Consistent with the immature brain cell-
cell interactions (10), human axons grew along blood vessels and as fiber bundles (Fig. 1E, 
movie S2), and parallel and radially oriented axonal layers could be detected below the dura 
mater (Fig. 1F; movie S3), similar to the ones found in human cortex (18).  
Given the widespread axonal extension outside the graft area, we asked which brain regions 
human neurons target 5 mpt. Main SCx1 target areas showed a higher number of human 
fibers compared to areas known to receive fewer projections from SCx1 (fig. S6), suggesting 
the direction of axon elongation is targeted. For example, ipsilateral motor cortex, striatum, 
thalamus and contralateral SCx1 received more fibers than cerebellum and substantia nigra, 
and the corpus callosum had more axonal tracts compared to the internal capsule and 
cerebral peduncle, (fig. S6), as expected from rodent tracing experiments (19). These data 
provide evidence for long-range (over centimeters) axon growth of grafted human neurons 
through the mouse adult brain, and indicate that while human axons are either not 
responsive, or can overcome, the inhibitory signals present in the adult mouse brain, they 
may be directed by existing guidance cues or paths.  
After an initial phase of growth (20), the selective pruning of axons and dendrites is thought 
to normally occur via retraction and degeneration during early development (2, 21). We 
explored the mechanisms of human neurite pruning up to 3 mpt (Fig. 1G-L, fig. S7A-B). At 
this stage, neurons were still migrating (Fig. 1G) and developing neural processes in a 
highly dynamic mode (Fig. 1G-L). We tracked the fate of 92 human neurites from 88 cells 
in 6 mice at 3 mpt (fig. 1G-L). While most neurites elongated in 24h (58.4 ± 5.5%), neurite 
refinement was dynamic, and interchanging retraction and elongation of individual neurites 
over 24 h (31.0 ± 2.1%) were observed (Fig. 1I-L). Developmental neurite degeneration

involves cytoskeletal destruction with widespread fragmentation over a time scale of 12-48 
h (22), whereas retracting axons do not leave fluorescent fragments behind (23). Reducing 
the imaging interval from 24 h to 8 h showed that branch pruning (Fig. 1I) occurred mainly 
by retraction (91%), rather than degeneration (Fig. 1I’, 9%). Axonal en passant boutons 
(EPBs), one of the two types of presynaptic specialization on cortical axons (24), could be 
observed in branches with a growth cone elongating (Fig. 1J). Neural processes extended 
long distances (maximum neurite extension = 462.769 µm in 24 h) at a speed of 10.29 ± 
0.73 µm/h (fig. 1K), comparable to that observed in the neonatal mouse brain (23). Results 
were validated with tissue grafts from an independent control line (fig. S7A-B). 
 
Human synaptic development imaged in vivo  
Next, we studied the dynamics of synaptogenesis up to 4 mpt. Hallmarks of developing 
synaptic networks are 1) an increase in synaptic density over time, followed by pruning, and 
2) the acquisition of a steady state with balanced rates of synaptic gain and loss (25). 
However, when and how human synaptic networks acquire these properties is unclear. We 
first considered dendritic spine formation and elimination (Fig. 2A-F).  
After the initial phase of cell migration and neurite remodeling (fig. 1G, H), neurons 
stabilized allowing us to track the same cells over time (fig. 2A, fig. S8). Dendritic spines, 
the structural correlates of mammalian excitatory synapses (26), were seen as early as 20 
dpt (32.8 ± 5.5 dpt, for either dendritic filopodia, considered the precursors of dendritic 
spines, or spines; n = 3 mice) (27, 28). We followed > 500 dendritic segments from 6 mice 
over days. However, for most dendrites, the density of synapses was too low to

quantitatively study the dynamics of dendritic spines before 3 mpt, as expected from 
previous human fetal cerebral cortex post-mortem work (29) and the early developmental 
stage modeled here. Eight neurons had sufficient dendritic spine numbers at 3 mpt to 
calculate spine density and turnover over 3-4 consecutive sessions of 48-hour intervals (up 
to 6 days). The average spine density was similar to human early fetal cerebral cortex (29) 
and constant over the imaging period (Fig. 2C, 0.043 ± 0.006 spines/µm; n = 70 spines 
present in the first session, 176 in total; Kruskal-Wallis test, P > 0.05). Synaptic structures 
were added and eliminated at equal rates even at these early developmental stages (Fig. 
2D; Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank test, P > 0.05). The turnover ratio, a function of 
both spine gain and loss (30), was 46.9 ± 5.3% over 4 days (Fig. 2E), indicating synaptic 
reorganization.

To investigate the development of synaptic remodeling over time we repeated the same 
experiment after one month. Again, spine density was constant over time (Fig. 2C, 0.112 ± 
0.024 spines/µm; n = 171 spines present in the first session, 291 in total; Kruskal-Wallis 
test, P > 0.05). However, the average spine density was increased at 4 mpt. The majority of 
dendrites had balanced rates of dendritic spine gain and loss (Fig. 2D, paired two-tailed t-
test, P > 0.05), and only in one cell we were able to capture net synaptic pruning over 2 
days (Fig. 2C, thick dashed line), consistent with the idea that a major phase of synaptic 
pruning occurs only at later developmental stages (28). 
The turnover ratio over 4 days was 27.6 ± 3.7%, which was lower than at 3 mpt (Fig. 2E). 
Consistently, the survival fraction, defined as the fraction of spines surviving as a function 
of time, was higher at 4 mpt (Fig. 2F), suggesting stabilization of dendritic spine dynamics 
over time.  
To more thoroughly assess synaptic dynamics, we also studied presynaptic terminals along 
human cortical axons (Fig. 2G-L). The density of boutons remained stable over time (Fig. 
2I, 0.051 ± 0.0075 EPBs/µm; n = 69 EPBs in the first session, 145 in total), indicating that 
axonal boutons were also added and eliminated at equal rates (Fig. 2L). The turnover rate 
over 4 days was 45.1 ± 3.6% (Fig. 2J, K), denoting comparable dynamics between dendritic 
spines and axonal boutons (at 3 mpt: Mann-Whitney U-test, P = 0.3394).  
In summary, we were able to study early events of human cortical neuron synaptogenesis 
over the first 4 mpt. Despite the low synaptic density, consistent with the primordial stage 
modeled here (29), there are a number of conclusions we can draw on early in vivo human 
synaptic network development. First, transplanted human neurons initially formed synaptic 
structures within 4-12 weeks of in vivo development, similar to human fetal cerebral cortex

(29). Second, they underwent synaptic reorganization. Third, they progressively increased 
dendritic spine density over one month. Finally, human neurons balanced the rates of 
synaptic gain and loss over a time scale of few days. 
 
Functional human cortical networks imaged in vivo 
Patterned neural activity is thought to be fundamental to neural circuit development in the 
immature brain (31, 32). While spontaneous and sparse activity can be detected in human 
cortical network preparations in vitro, recapitulating patterns typical of early human cortical 
population activity, such as recurrent oscillatory bursts (32), remains challenging (33, 34).  
 
We first investigated the electrophysiological properties of transplanted cells. We performed 
ex vivo whole-cell recordings in coronal brain slices containing the grafts (fig. S9). Current-
clamp recordings were made from 18 pyramidal shaped somas (n = 4 mice), as identified 
by differential interference contrast microscopy, expression of either GFP or Td-Tomato, 
and by filling neurons with Lucifer yellow dye prior to post-hoc anatomical inspection (fig. 
S9A). Patched grafted pyramidal-like neurons were at different stages of biophysical 
maturation and development, with an average resting membrane potential of -53.8 ± 1.7 
mV, average capacitance of 19.4 ± 2.2 pF and average input resistance of 1.4 ± 0.1 GW. 
While cells were quiescent at resting membrane potentials, depolarizing current-steps 
evoked action potential firing in all pyramidal neurons tested (fig. S9B), with average action 
potential amplitudes of 91.3 ± 2.6 mV and half-widths of 2.2 ± 0.2 ms.

Immunohistochemistry showed glutamatergic and GABAergic terminals within the human 
graft (Fig. S10 A and B). To confirm that human neurons received both excitatory and 
inhibitory input, pyramidal shaped neurons were voltage-clamped (-70 mV) and 
spontaneous miniature excitatory synaptic currents (mEPSC) were observed at a frequency 
of 0.30 ± 0.05 Hz (5 out of 18 neurons) with an amplitude of 20.1 ± 3.2 pA, which was 
completely blocked by the α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) 
receptor antagonist 2,3-dihydroxy-6-nitro-7-sulfamoyl-benzo-quinoxaline-2,3-dione (NBQX) 
(n = 4). Although synaptic events were observed in the remaining neurons, spontaneous 
frequency was insufficient to acquire enough events for statistical analysis (fig. S9C and 
S7C-D). Using a high chloride (130 mM) internal solution and in the presence of NBQX, 
spontaneous miniature inhibitory synaptic currents (mIPSC) were observed at a frequency 
of 0.24 ± 0.12 Hz (3 out of 6 neurons) with an amplitude of -73.3 ± 21.0 pA, that was fully 
inhibited by bicuculline (n = 3) (fig. S9C). Similar to mEPSC, inhibitory synaptic events were 
observed in the remaining neurons but insufficient events were acquired for detailed kinetic 
analysis. In summary, grafted neurons are excitable and fire action potentials. In addition, 
they receive both excitatory and inhibitory input, suggesting functional network connectivity. 
 
To determine the origin of the afferent synaptic input to the functionally active neurons, we 
performed monosynaptic retrograde tracing using a modified rabies virus. This virus lacks a 
glycoprotein needed for replication and can only infect cells expressing the 
avian tumor virus receptor A (TVA) (fig. S11). Human iPSC-derived cortical progenitors and 
neurons were transduced with a lentiviral vector containing the TVA, nuclear GFP and 
glycoprotein, under the control of the human synapsin promoter (fig. S11A). Five months

after the transplantation, the modified mCherry expressing-rabies virus was injected in the 
same location, where only grafted cells expressing the TVA are susceptible to infection. 
Cells that are monosynaptically connected to the infected human cells also become infected 
and express mCherry, allowing for accurate tracing of the neural input to the cells in the 
human grafts (fig. S11B). We observed that while most of the input to the transplanted 
human neurons comes from other human neurons (92.5% ± 1.5%, n = 4333 cells in 2 
brains), host neurons also innervate the human graft (7.5% ± 1.5%, n = 397 cells in 2 brains) 
(fig. S11C). The traced host neurons were located within the graft, in the cortical areas 
adjacent to the graft, in the contralateral cortex, and in the ipsilateral CA1 hippocampal 
region (fig. S11B). While no traced neurons were found in other subcortical regions, 
thalamocortical terminals were present in the graft (fig. S10; see also fig. S12) (20). These 
results provide evidence that most synaptic input to the grafts comes from other human 
neurons. Furthermore, since no interneurons of human origin were found, these data, 
together with the demonstration that human neurons in the graft receive inhibitory input (fig. 
S9C, bottom panel), suggest that inhibition in the human grafts comes from the host. 
 
To assess the functional development of cortical networks in vivo, we engineered neurons 
to express the genetically encoded calcium indicator GCaMP6s (35) prior to grafting and 
studied calcium-mediated neuronal activity in vivo (Fig. 3; n = 8 mice). Spontaneous, sparse 
activity (Fig. 3A-C) was detected as early as 2 weeks post-transplantation (wpt) and 
persisted up to 3 mpt (Fig. 3C). In addition, bursts of activity synchronized across the 
neuropil and multiple cells (31) were also detected at 1 mpt (Fig. 3C, inset) and persisted in 
all grafts tested up to 5 mpt (fig. S7E-H and movies S4, S5).

Many of these bursts had a defined spatiotemporal order (Fig. 3D,E), as well as recurrent

between 1 and 3 mpt (Fig. 3C, inset), resembling activity recorded in human developing 
cortex (36, 37), and consistent with a report on transplanted human cerebral organoids (38). 
 
Recordings of calcium signals with air-puff stimulation of the animal’s whiskers and facial 
skin, revealed that grafted neurons in the primary somatosensory cortex can be responsive 
to sensory stimulation (fig. S12; ~ 30% of the stimulation trials in one mouse; neither of the 
other two animals tested showed sensory-evoked activity), indicating that thalamocortical 
synapses can functionally drive activity in the human graft at 6 mpt.

Imaging human neuron structural and functional 
dynamics in Down syndrome  
 
So far, we have characterized the structural and functional dynamics of human cortical 
neurons during the earliest phases of their development in vivo (fig. 1-3) and validated the 
main results with neurons from an independent control iPSC-line (WT-2, fig. S7). To model 
the in vivo dynamics of pruning, synaptogenesis and network activity in a complex genetic 
disorder, we first generated iPSC-derived progenitors and neurons from two individuals with 
Down syndrome (fig. S1), and then transplanted them in adult immunodeficient mice. During 
the reprogramming process of one of these lines (Ts21-2), we identified a disomic clone 
that had lost one extra copy of human chromosome 21 (Hsa21) (WT-2) (39-41). We used a 
microsatellite short tandem repeat (STR) assay to confirm that the parental fibroblast 
population was not mosaic for disomy and trisomy 21, and that Ts21-2 and WT-2 are 
otherwise identical to each other and the initial fibroblasts (fig. S13). This revertant disomic 
line (WT-2) allowed us to highlight phenotypes caused by an extra copy of Hsa21, rather 
than by genetic differences between individuals, without the need for multiple control lines, 
typically required to control for genetic variations or diverse differentiation potencies 
observed in genetically distinct human iPSC lines (42). Genome-wide copy number single 
nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) assay confirmed that the two Ts21 iPSC lines had normal 
karyotype, except for the extra copy of Hsa21 (fig. S14). Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization 
(FISH) on cortical tissue grafts further verified the presence of the extra copy of Hsa21 (fig. 
S15). The Ts21 lines generated progenitors, neurons and proliferating cells similarly to 
control grafts at 5 mpt (fig. S16 and fig. S17). Astroglia, however, were overproduced in 
Ts21 grafts (fig. S16), recapitulating the human pathology (43). Ts21 neurons were also

present in stable locations to the end of our experimental timeline, allowing for in vivo single-
cell-tracking (fig. S18). Chronic in vivo imaging revealed that Ts21 neurons had similar rates 
of axon growth/retraction compared to control neurons at 3 wpt (fig. 4A-D), suggesting 
normal early developmental axon refinement. In addition, Ts21 neurons in the graft formed 
morphologically mature synaptic structures, which were plastic over time (fig. 4E-L). To 
determine whether dendritic spine growth was associated with synapse formation in Ts21 
neurons, we reconstructed in one transplant, with electron microscopy (EM), a subset of the 
same dendrites after long-term in vivo imaging (fig. 4E, F, G). We found that newly formed 
dendritic spines formed synapses in 14 out of 34 cases (41%) and 6 of them (6 out of 14, 
43%) within 48 hours of their first appearance. Serial EM reconstructions revealed that 
human dendritic spines and presynaptic terminals contained a postsynaptic density and 
synaptic vesicles, respectively, suggestive of complete synaptic maturation (fig. 4G). 
Indeed, whole-cell recordings from coronal brain slices containing the Ts21 grafts showed 
normal synaptic input on the DS-donor derived neurons compared to control (fig. S19, A to 
D), suggesting functional synaptic connections. Longitudinal in vivo imaging, however, 
showed that dendritic spines, and to a lesser extent synaptic boutons (fig. 4J-L), were more 
stable in neurons from both individuals with DS than in control, as demonstrated by higher 
survival and reduced turnover (fig. 4H, I; fig. S20). High density of GFP positive neurons 
prevented a quantitative analysis of synaptic dynamics in the WT-2 line. To understand 
whether the higher dendritic spine survival rates in Ts21 lead to higher spine density, we 
quantified dendritic spine density across the four lines. We found an increase in dendritic 
spine density in neurons from the Ts21-1 compared to WT-1 (fig. S21A), althought this 
increase did not reach significance consistent with post-mortem fetal DS brain analysis at ~

5-8 gestational months (27). However, we found higher spine densities in Ts21-2 compared 
to WT-2, our most reliable comparison (fig. S21A). Putting the data from the two Ts21 and 
WT lines together highlighted a significant spine density increase in the Ts21 cells (fig. 
S21B). Overall, these data raise the possibility that spine density in DS cortical neurons 
could be higher than control, at least at the early developmental stages tested here. No 
difference in EPB density was found across the four lines (fig. S21 C and D). 
To investigate further the increased synaptic stability phenotype, we studied neural 
population activity, a main regulator of postnatal synaptic refinement and stabilization (26), 
through in vivo calcium imaging of GCaMP6-expressing Ts21 grafts (fig. 4M-N). We 
measured both burst and global activity (see methods). These measures were reduced in 
Ts21 grafts (fig. 4O-Q). Together, these data highlight in vivo synaptic stability and 
functional early cortical network phenotypes in DS.

Conclusion 
We investigated the earliest stages of human axon, synaptic and network activity 
development in a complex genetic disorder by combining live imaging in a multi-structured 
tissue environment and patient-specific genetic background.  
 
Transplanted human neurons continued to develop and mature in vivo, in a 
microenvironment that retained features reminiscent of human fetal cortex, such as the large 
size (up to ~100 mm3 at 5 mpt, movie S1), temporal order and duration (i.e. many months) 
of neurogenesis (20), vascularization, cell diversification (human-derived cortical 
progenitors, neurons, oligodendrocytes and astrocytes together with host-derived microglia 
and vessels), as well as complex cytoarchitecture. However, the extent to which neurons in 
human cortical tissue grafts, either generated from human iPSCs (present study) or ESCs 
(20, 38, 44), can mimic the maturation, complexity and functionality of early human fetal 
cortical networks remains to be fully established. 
 
Repeated imaging of single human neurons in cortical tissue grafts enabled us to gain 
insights on pruning, synaptic refinement, and functional neural network formation in vivo.  
We found that pruning mainly occurred by branch-specific retraction, rather than 
degeneration.

Nascent human excitatory synaptic networks already had balanced rates of synaptic gain 
and loss over ~ one week at the single cell level, suggesting that immature human neurons 
possess intrinsic programs of synaptic turnover regulation over relatively short time scales. 
Human synaptogenesis and axon growth were concurrent, rather than happening at 
different times, confirming previous post-mortem static analysis (28), and revealing 
conservation of this developmental growth program between species (45). 
 
Oscillatory population activity had marked neuropil and soma synchronization which 
became more prominent over 2 months, underscoring on-going modifications of cortical 
circuits. Results were robust across two independent control lines, providing a basis for 
applying this approach, which combines live imaging in a multi-structured tissue 
environment 
with 
patient-specific 
genetic 
background 
(46), 
to 
many 
other 
neurodevelopmental diseases affecting the cortex.  
 
Here we modeled a complex genetic disorder and saw that while developmental axon 
refinement was normal, synapses were more stable and neural network activity was 
reduced in tissue grafts from two individuals with DS, suggesting a possible role for 
patterned activity in regulating synaptic lifetimes in the early stages of human cortical circuit 
development (32). These deficits were evident even after Ts21 cells were exposed to the in 
vivo physiological microenvironment of the mouse brain for several months, indicating cell-
intrinsic deficits. Consistently, using a revertant disomic iPSC line we showed that the 
population activity deficits were rescued by the loss of an extra copy of Hsa21, indicating

that heightened expression of Hsa 21 genes is both necessary and sufficient to disrupt 
oscillatory burst activity in developing cortical DS networks in vivo. 
 
In most previous work, human ESC or iPSCs-derived neurons have been transplanted in 
the damaged cortex (38, 47), spinal cord (48), striatum (49, 50) or retina (51), with the aim 
of cell replacement (11), rather than for disease modelling (6, 52), as demonstrated in our 
study. Transplantation and in vivo imaging for disease modelling in mice is advantageous 
compared to higher species such as primates, as larger numbers of animals can be used to 
track cells in the grafts over long periods of time, while providing a microenvironment 
containing vessels, immune cells and innervation, not present in common in vitro 
preparations.  
 
In summary, we established a new in vivo experimental model of DS to study how the 
chromosomal abnormality affects the earliest stages of human axon, synaptic and functional 
neural network development. We expect this single-cell-resolution intravital microscopy 
approach will advance the knowledge of cellular pathophysiology in this and other 
neurodevelopmental disorders, particularly valuable in light of the scarcity of early human 
fetal brain tissue material.

Generation of iPSC cultures 
Human stem cell research was approved by the Steering Committee for the UK Stem 
Cell Bank and for the Use of Stem Cell Lines. Skin biopsies were collected from donor 
individuals with Down Syndrome by the University of Cambridge Dept. of Psychiatry, 
following approval of the Cambridgeshire Research Ethics Committee, with informed 
consent from the donor or representative. Samples were designated anonymous identifiers 
following collection. Skin punch biopsies were subdivided and cultured at 37°C in 5% 
CO2 in DMEM + Glutamax (Thermo Fisher Scientific) supplemented with 10% foetal 
calf serum, penicillin (50 U ml−1), and streptomycin (50 µg ml−1) and 1 mM Sodium 
Pyruvate (Sigma) until fibroblast outgrowth was observed. When plates were confluent, 
fibroblasts were trypsinized and transferred to T75 dishes for further expansion. Cellular 
reprogramming of fibroblasts was carried out using Cytotune 2.0 Sendai Reprogramming 
kits (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturers protocol, and established 
using feeder free conditions in Essential-8 media (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Cells were 
grown in Essential-8 medium (Thermo Fisher Scientific) as feeder free cultures on 
Geltrex (Thermo Fisher Scientific) coated plates and maintained at 5% CO2 at 37°C in a 
humidified incubator. 
Primary skin fibroblasts from a Ts21 donor were reprogrammed using non-integrative 
Sendai viruses and obtained clones showed high expression levels of the stem cell 
pluripotency factor Oct4 (Fig. S1C). Clones were genotyped for the presence of the extra 
copy of human chromosome 21 (Hsa21) using a Taq Man copy number assay with probes 
for APP and Down Syndrome Critical Region 1 (DSCR1), two genes located on Hsa21. 
All clones showed the presence of three copies of APP and DSCR1 indicating trisomism 
of Hsa21 (Fig. S1A). During this initial screen we also found one clone from the trisomic 
donor that was disomic for APP and DSCR1 indicating a loss of the extra copy of Hsa21 
during the re-programming process. Throughout this study we further used published 
disomic control (WT-1, NDC1.2, non-demented control) (53) and trisomic human iPSCs 
(Ts21-1) (54) (Fig. S1A) and compared those to our trisomic/revertant disomic pair. 
 
Directed differentiation of human iPSCs  
Directed differentiation of iPSCs to cortical excitatory neurons was carried out as 
previously described (8). Briefly, 24 h before the start of differentiation iPSCs were 
passaged with 0.5 mM EDTA and plated at high density. Upon reaching 100% 
confluence the neuronal induction was started (Day 0). The medium was changed to 
neuronal maintenance medium supplemented with 10 µM SB431542 (Tocris) and 1 µM 
Dorsomorphin (Tocris) and was changed daily. On day 12 the neuroepithelial sheet was 
lifted off with Dispase (Thermo Fisher Scientific), broken up to small clumps and plated 
on laminin (Sigma) coated plates in neuronal maintenance medium supplemented with 10 
µM SB431542 and 1 µM Dorsomorphin. On the next day (Day 13), the media was 
changed to neuronal maintenance medium supplemented with 20 ng ml-1 Fibroblast 
growth factor 2 (FGF2; PeproTech). Medium was changed every other day and FGF2 
was removed from the medium on day 17. Cells were split with Dispase at a 1:2 ratio 
when neuronal rosettes started to meet.  On day 25 cells were dissociated with Accutase 
(Thermo Fisher Scientific) and plated at a 1:1 ratio on laminin coated plates. Cell were

expanded 1:2 when they reached 90% confluence until day 33. On day 31-33 they were 
infected with high titer lentiviruses. Neurons were engrafted between day 36 and 38.  
Neuronal maintenance medium (1 L) consisted of 500 ml DMEM:F12 + glutamax 
(Thermo Fisher Scientific), 0.25 ml Insulin (10 mg ml-1, Sigma), 1 ml 2-mercaptoethanol 
(50mM Thermo Fisher Scientific),  5 ml non-essential amino acids (100 X Thermo 
Fischer Scientific), 5 ml Sodium Pyruvate (100 mM, Sigma), 2.5 ml Pens/Strep (10000 
U/µl, ThermoFisher Scientific), 5 ml N2 (ThermoFisher Scientific), 10 ml B27 (Thermo 
Fisher Scientific), 5 ml Glutamax (100 X, Thermo Fisher Scientific) and 500 ml 
Neurobasal (Thermo Fisher Scientific) medium.  
 
Copy number assay in vitro 
Neurons were grown in neuronal maintenance medium, harvested with Accutase and 
genomic DNA was isolated with the DNeasy Blood & Tissue kit (Quiagen) following the 
manufacturers protocol. The presence of an extra copy of chromosome 21 was 
determined using a TaqMan copy number assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for APP 
(Hs01180853_cn, Thermo Fisher Scientific) and DSCR1 (Hs01114326_cn, Thermo 
Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturers protocol using 5 µl genomic DNA.  
 
Gene expression analysis in vitro 
RNA was collected from day 35-36 cultures and profiled with a custom Nanostring 
gene expression panel of approximately 250 genes. After subtracting the maximum 
negative control probe counts, gene counts were normalized using the geometric mean of 
6 positive control probes and of 7 housekeeping genes (CLTC, GAPDH, GUSB, PPIA, 
RPLP1, RPS15A, RPS9). 
 
Western blot in vitro 
Whole cell protein extraction was performed by lysis of cell pellets in RIPA buffer 
supplemented with protease inhibitors tablets (Roche) and phosphatase inhibitors 
(Thermo Scientific) before removal of the soluble fraction. Western blot analysis was 
carried out using the following antibodies: β-actin, anti-APP C-Terminal Fragment, Tuj1, 
Synapsin1 and PSD95. 
 
Cell line identity verification 
    Genomic DNA was extracted from iPSC clones using DNeasy Blood & Tissue kit 
(Qiagen) following the manufacturers protocol and profiled with PowerPlex 16 HS 
Multiplex STR assay (Promega). Genotype of third allele in trisomy lines was 
extrapolated from electropherogram peak height. 
 
Genome-wide copy number SNP assay 
    Genomic DNA was extracted from iPSC clones using DNeasy Blood & Tissue kit 
(Qiagen) following the manufacturers protocol and sent for SNP analysis using the 
Infinium HumanCytoSNP-12 platform (Illumina), except for the WT-1 sample, which 
was run on CytoSNP850K platform (higher density). Data was processed using 
GenomeStudio 2.0 and CNV-region-report-v2.1 (Illumina).

Lentiviral production 
Third generation lentivirus was produced by calcium phosphate transfection of 
HeK293T cells with pBOB-Syn-GFP or pBOB-Syn-GCaMP6s-P2A-tdTomato plasmids 
and complemented with the packaging plasmids pRSV-Rev and pMDLg/pRRE and the 
VSVG envelope plasmid pMD2.G. 
 
Animals 
Adult immunodeficient mice (n = 57; 3-4 month-old; NOD-SCID gamma, Charles 
River, UK) were used for all in vivo imaging experiments. All mice were given access to 
food and water ad libitum and maintained in a 12-hour light-dark cycle. All procedures 
were conducted by researchers holding a UK personal license and conducted in 
accordance with the UK Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986.  
 
Craniotomy and human neuron transplantation 
Cranial windows were surgically implanted over the somatosensory cortex as 
previously described (30). Mice were anaesthetized with ketamine-xylazine 
intraperitoneal injection (0.083 mg/g ketamine, 0.0078 mg/g xylazine) and then 
administered intramuscular dexamethasone (0.02 ml at 4 mg/ml), to reduce inflammation, 
and subcutaneous bupivacaine (1 mg/kg), a local anesthetic. A few drops of lidocaine (1 
% solution) were applied on the skull surface prior to a ~5 mm diameter craniotomy 
being drilled over the somatosensory cortex. Neurons previously transduced (DIV 31) 
with a lentiviral vector (LV) carrying either a GFP or a calcium reporter gene under the 
neuron-specific Human Synapsyn-1 promoter (LV-hSyn-GFP and LV-hSyn-GCaMP6s-
2A-tdTomato, respectively) were dissociated with 1 ml accutase enzyme mix (Sigma), 
centrifuged and washed at 1200 rpm in PBS, before being resuspended in 15-20 
microliters of cortex buffer for cell counts.  
We injected 20,000 cells in two sites spaced 0.5 mm apart (i.e. 40,000 cells in total 
in 1 µl) in the AP axis at coordinates: AP -1.8; L +2.8; V -0.5 mm from bregma (i.e. the 
somatosensory cortex barrel field) using a micro pump (UMP-3, World Precision 
Instruments, USA) and a microelectrode (< 50 µm at the tip).  
A glass coverslip was then placed over the craniotomy and sealed with cyanoacrilic 
veterinary glue and dental cement. The exposed skull was subsequently covered in dental 
cement and a metal bar included on the top for positioning at the two-photon microscope 
stage. Mice were allowed to recover for 21 days before imaging. 
 
Two-Photon imaging in vivo 
A purpose built two-photon microscope (Prairie Technologies) equipped with a 
tunable coherent Ti:Sapphire laser (Coherent) and PrairieView acquisition software was 
used for all imaging experiments. Mice were anaesthetized with oxygen and isoflurane 
mix (0.6-1.5 %) and secured to the microscope stage with the head metal bar attached to a 
custom-built fixed support. Eye ointment (Lacri-lube) was applied to the eyes to prevent 
dehydration and the temperature was maintained at around 36 °C by a heating pad. An 
Olympus 4 X objective with a 0.13 numerical aperture (NA) was used to identify 
characteristic blood vessels to reliably relocate regions-of-interest (ROIs) at each imaging 
time point. Olympus 20 X (NA = 1.2), 40 X (NA = 0.8) and 60 X (NA = 0.9) water 
immersion objectives were then used to acquire several ROIs per animal (GFP: 75 x 75 
  
 
5 
 
µm field of view, 512 x 512 pixels for neurite imaging and 50 x 50 µm field of view, 
1024 x 1024 pixels for synaptic imaging, 1 µm step size; GCaMP6-tdTomato: 300 x 300 
µm field of view, 256 x 256 pixels, single plane). A pulsed 910 nm laser beam was used 
with typical power never exceeding 70 mW on the back focal plane.  
For calcium imaging, mice were lightly anaesthetized and transduced cells were 
identified using the TdTomato signal at 1040 nm. Four minutes recording sessions were 
then acquired at 3 Hz with the 920 nm laser to excite GCaMP6s. GCaMP6-expressing 
neurons have been shown to display normal physiological properties including input 
resistance, resting membrane potential, input–output relationship, synaptic input maps, 
and normal synaptic plasticity (55). Moreover, we found no difference between GFP and 
GCaMP6s expressing human neurons in terms of their biophysical/synaptic properties 
(unpaired t-test, P > 0.05). 
 
Electron microscopy  
Immediately after the last imaging session, the mouse was perfused with a buffered 
solution of 2.5% glutaraldehyde and 2% paraformaldehyde. The brain was then removed 
and serial 60-micron thick sections cut tangentially to its surface at the region of the 
previous live imaging. The sections were then stained with heavy metals and embedded 
in resin. Blocks were made in the region of the graft area which was visible in the resin 
embedded sections. Thin sections were cut at 50 nm thickness and collected on single slot 
grids. These were further stained and imaged in a transmission electron microscope 
(Tecnai, FEI Company). 
 
Correlated 2-photon-serial electron microscopy  
We reconstructed 41 dendritic spines, which had been imaged previously in vivo on 
a Ts21-1 neuron. Immediately after the last imaging session, the mouse was perfused 
with a buffered solution of 2.5% glutaraldehyde and 2% paraformaldehyde. The brain 
was then removed and serial 60-micron thick sections cut tangentially to its surface at the 
region of the previous live imaging. These sections were then imaged again in the 2-
photon microscope and laser marks burnt around the exact dendrites of interest. The 
sections were then stained with heavy metals and embedded in resin. Blocks were made 
around the visible laser marks and imaged using block face scanning microscopy (Gatan 
3View and Zeiss Merlin scanning electron microscope). Serial images were taken of the 
regions of interest, and these were aligned using the FIJI software, and the dendrites and 
axonal boutons reconstructed using the TrakEM2 tools. The 3D structure of the 
reconstructed dendrite and presynaptic boutons (Fig. 4F) was created with Blender 
software (version 2.57; Blender Foundation, http://www.blender.org). 
 
Electrophysiology 
Coronal slices (350 µm) containing the somatosensory cortex (Bregma -0.3 to +1.4 
mm) were maintained at room temperature (22-25ºC) in an external solution containing 
(in mM) NaCl 125, KCl 2.5, NaH2PO4 1.25, NaHCO3 25, CaCl2 2, MgCl2 1, D-glucose 
10, D-mannitol 15, equilibrated with 95% O2, 5% CO2, pH 7.4. Human neurons were 
visualized in the somatosensory cortex by the expression and excitation of GFP. Whole-
cell current-clamp (Ifast) and voltage-clamp recordings were made at ~35 °C using 
borosilicate glass pipettes (4-8 MΩ) containing (in mM) Kgluconate 130, KCl 10, EGTA 
  
 
6 
 
0.5, NaCl 1, CaCl2 0.28, MgCl2 3, Na2ATP 3, GTP 0.3, phosphocreatine 14 and HEPES 
10 (pH 7.2). Neurons were also voltage-clamped at -70 mV using a modified internal 
solution in which Kgluconate was replaced with CsCl (130 mM). Slices were bathed in 
(+)-bicuculline (20 µM) for miniature excitatory currents (mEPSC) or NBQX for 
miniature inhibitory currents (mIPSC). For anatomical inspection, Lucifer-yellow-CH (1 
mg/ml) was added to the internal electrode solution. Following access to the whole-cell 
configuration, Lucifer-yellow was allowed to dialyze the neuron for 10-15 minutes before 
gradually withdrawing the patch electrode from the cell. Slices were fixed in 4% (w/v) 
paraformaldehyde and permeabilized in PBS containing 0.4% (v/v) Triton-x and 2% (v/v) 
chicken serum. Slices were incubated with a rabbit anti-Lucifer-yellow antibody for 2-3 
days at 4 °C and then incubated with a chicken anti-rabbit antibody conjugated with 
Alexa-594. Slices were mounted on glass coverslips prior to 2-photon imaging. Synaptic 
kinetic analysis was performed only on cells with at least 40 recorded events. 
 
Immunohistochemistry, histology and related analysis 
Neurons in vitro were washed with PBS and fixed with 4% PFA for 10 minutes, 
then blocked in a 5% normal goat serum in TBS + 0.3% Triton X-100 solution, incubated 
overnight with primary antibodies (Supplementary Table 1), and with the appropriate 
Alexa-dye conjugated secondary antibodies (1:500, Thermo Fisher Scientific) diluted in 
TBS + 0.3% Triton X-100. 4’,6-Diamidino-2-Phenylindole (DAPI, 5 µg/ml final 
concentration) was used for nuclear counterstaining. Imaging was performed on an 
inverted Leica TCS SP8 scanning confocal microscope (Leica Microsystems). 4 µm 
image stacks were acquired and the z projection was used for counting cells using a 
custom automated ImageJ (NIH) script.  
At the end of the live imaging experiments, animals were anesthetized with an 
overdose of ketamine and xylazine, and then perfused intracardially with PBS followed 
by 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA). Brains were fixed overnight in 4% PFA. Coronal brain 
sections were cut at 40 µm in a vibratome (Leica VT1000S) and stored free-floating in 
PBS with 0.01% NaN3. For the cellular characterization of the grafts, consecutive 
sections containing the graft were blocked in a 10% donkey serum with 0.5% Triton X-
100 PBS solution, and then incubated overnight with primary antibodies 
(Supplementary Table 1). Sections were then incubated with appropriate secondary 
antibodies (1:1000, Alexa Fluor®, Thermo Fisher Scientific). All incubations were 
performed in 5% donkey serum with 0.1% Triton X-100 PBS solution. When using 
primary antibodies raised in mouse and rat in the same tissue sections, primary and 
secondary antibody incubations were performed sequentially to avoid the anti-rat 
secondary antibody cross-reacting with mouse immunoglobulins. Sections were mounted 
using ProLong® Gold Antifade Mountant (Thermo Fisher Scientific). All sections 
stained with anti-NuMA antibody required a sodium citrate (10 mM, pH 6) heat-mediated 
antigen retrieval procedure. Brain sections were imaged with either a scanning confocal 
TCS SP5 II or SP8 microscope (Leica Microsystems), using a 20 X (NA 0.75) or oil-
immersion 40 X objective (NA 1.45). ROIs were randomly selected within the graft area. 
A customised semi-automated script was used to analyze images with nuclear markers in 
FIJI. Briefly, nuclei were segmented and intensity values of segmented objects measured 
across all channels after background subtraction. Threshold levels were set to define 
positive objects. The criteria for threshold selection was elimination of type I error while 
  
 
7 
 
minimising the occurrence of type II error (<10%). Astrocytes (GFAP+) and 
oligodendrocyte progenitors (PDGFRa+) were manually counted in FIJI. Microglia was 
analysed using a custom Cell Profiler pipeline (Bloomfield et al, in press).  
For the volumetric assessment of the graft, ROIs were drawn around human-specific 
Neural Cell Adhesion Molecule (hNCAM)-labelled human graft and each of their areas 
measured from every second consecutive coronal mouse section (total 48 sections, 140 
µm apart) in ImageJ. Volume was calculated from the sum of areas, section thickness, 
and interval, according to Cavalieri’s principle (56), and independently confirmed with 
Imaris image analysis software (Bitplane). 
Teratoma formation was excluded and vascularization confirmed (20 out of 20 
grafts) by inspection of H&E stained material by an expert pathologist.  
For mapping axonal projections at 5 mpt, sections at 120 µm intervals were selected 
across the entire brain (n = 3), and immunostained for hNCAM (Supplementary Table 1) 
as above. All sections were imaged with an epifluorescence microscope (Olympus IX70) 
using a 20 X objective (NA 0.5, 0.321 µm pixel size). The Allen Mouse Brain Atlas 
(Paxinos and Franklin, 2001) was used to identify brain areas of interest. Image analysis 
was performed by manual counting of fibers using ImageJ. A color scheme with a range 
from grey (no projections) to bright red (more than 100 projections) was used to indicate 
the relative amount of axonal projections in each brain area. 
 
Retrograde trans-synaptic tracing 
TVA expressing lentivirus was produced as described previously using the pBOB-
SYN-HTB plasmid (Addgene plasmid # 30195). Neurons were infected with the 
lentivirus expressing rabies glycoprotein (G), TVA and nuclear GFP (LV-hSyn-G-TVA-
NLS-GFP) at day 30. The medium was changed the next day to remove the virus and 
neurons were stereotactically injected into the somatosensory cortex of adult NSG mice, 
as previously described. After 5 months, an EnvA-pseudotyped, G-deleted mCherry 
expressing rabies virus (EnvA + RVdG-mCherry) was injected in the same location. 
Animals were perfused 7 days later with 4% PFA intracardially, and the brains fixed 
overnight in 4% PFA. Coronal brain sections were cut at 50 µm in a vibratome, and 
stained with anti-human nuclei (hNu), anti-GFP and anti-DsRed antibodies 
(Supplementary Table 1), as described above. All regions of interest containing mCherry 
positive cells throughout the whole brain were imaged with a confocal Leica SP5 
microscope using a 20 X objective (NA 0.7), and quantifications of mCherry+/hNu+ and 
mCherry+/hNu- input cells were performed by manual counting using ImageJ.       
 
Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH) and analysis 
Brain sections (40 µm) were dehydrated in ethanol series (30%, 50% and 70%). 
Sections were allowed to air dry at room temperature for 1 day, re-hydrated in PBS and 
then permeabilised in PBS with 0.5% Triton X-100. A heat-mediated step with sodium 
citrate buffer (10 mM, pH 6) was performed. Slides were transferred to 2x SSC, and 
afterwards equilibrated in a 2x SSC with 50% formamide solution for at least 4 hours, at 
room temperature. After applying the Hsa21 probe (XL 21q22/XCP 21, Metasystems), a 
coverslip was sealed with rubber cement and then slides were allowed to rest for 1h at 
room temperature, to allow probe penetration in the section. Slides were incubated at 80 
°C for 5 minutes and then at 37 °C in a dark humidified chamber for 2 days, to allow 
  
 
8 
 
hybridization to occur. Slides were washed in 2x SSC at 37 °C, and then counterstained 
with DAPI (1:1000, Thermo Fisher Scientific). Sections were mounted using ProLong® 
Gold Antifade Mountant (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and imaged with a Leica SP5 
confocal laser scanning microscope using an oil-immersion 63 X (NA 1.45) objective, z-
stack range of 5-18 planes. 
Analysis was carried out manually in 3D. Cell nuclei within Z-stacks obtained by 
confocal microscopy were individually evaluated and annotated blind to genotype using 
ImageJ (NIH). Nuclei that appeared to be either truncated or damaged, or overlapped 
with other nuclei, or showed significant background ‘noise’ were not included in the 
scoring. A minimum of 50 nuclei from a minimum of two different Z-stacks were 
evaluated for each line. Based on the observed number of fluorescent hybridization 
signals, nuclei were assigned to four different categories, namely ‘one signal’, ‘two 
signals’ ‘three signals’ and ‘> three signals’.  Data gathered by FISH analysis on 
histological sections of grafts originating from euploid lines indicated that the assay met 
the sensitivity and specificity parameters generally recommended for FISH testing, >95% 
and >98% respectively (358 nuclei analyzed in total). On histological sections of grafts 
originating from Down syndrome cell lines, the presence of an extra copy of chromosome 
21 was confirmed by evaluating the frequency of the triple fluorescent pattern (‘three 
signals’ nuclei/total nuclei) and by comparing it to the specific cut-off threshold values 
calculated from the normal reference ranges (CRITBINOM, 95% Confidence Level). 
 
Data Analysis 
Neurite length quantification. Image stacks from in vivo two-photon images were 
processed with Image J (section alignment, background subtraction, brightness and 
contrast adjustment). Neurites were then manually traced from a clear reference point in 
the maximum intensity projections for length measurement.    
Dendritic spine/bouton dynamics. Quantifications were made at 3-4 mpt. Dendritic 
spine/bouton density was determined by blindly annotating dendritic spines/boutons in 
Matlab using custom made software (57) and metrics calculated in the following way:  
• Total number of boutons/spines reported in the text and figure legends were 
calculated as the total number in the first session plus the number of gains across all 
imaging sessions (i.e. each synaptic structure was counted only once). 
• Density of boutons/spines at any given time point a was defined as Density(a) = 
na/lengtha. 
• Turnover rate (TOR) was defined as (nG + nL)/(2*N), where nG and nL are the 
numbers of bouton/spine gains and losses respectively, and N is the total number of 
boutons/spines present in the same time interval. These total numbers include repeated 
counts of the same boutons/spines, in case they were present in more than one session. 
• Gains and losses fractions between session a and b were defined as Gains(a; b) = 
nG(b-a)/N(a+b) and Losses(a; b) = nL(b-a)/N(a+b). N includes repeated counts of the same 
boutons/spines, in case they were present in more than one session. 
• Survival fraction (Fr) was defined by the cumulative sum of EPBs/spines that 
survive at each time point (t), divided by the total number of EPBs/spines that were 
present at session 1:

In vivo calcium imaging. Time-series were pre-processed in ImageJ using the moco 
plugin for registration (58), followed by the application of a 3D median filter (2 x 2 x 2, 
in x-y-z, respectively).  
Analysis of sparse calcium activity. Neurons were selected based on the mean 
normalized maximum intensity projection of the data by hand and the nucleus was 
excluded from selection. Fluorescence traces were calculated as the average fluorescence 
of pixels lying within the cell in each frame. To remove slow changes in raw fluorescence 
traces, the 15th percentile value of the fluorescence distribution was subtracted from the 
raw fluorescence signal. %ΔF/F0 signals were calculated by dividing the raw fluorescence 
signal by the median of each cells fluorescence distribution and normalizing to the 
background calcium signal. Cellular activity was calculated using the integrated 
fluorescence as describe previously (59) with a 15% ΔF/F0 threshold. Activity was then 
normalized to the duration of our imaging paradigm to give values in %ΔF/F0/second, as 
described previously (60). 
Burst activity analysis. We defined bursts as global events where > 95% of the 
peak pixel intensity was above the threshold defined above, across each imaged cortical 
area. All regions were then visually inspected to further validate the presence of global 
events.  
Global activity analysis. Global analysis was the same as that for sparse activity, 
but for this analysis activity was measured over the entire region of interest.  
Burst direction. For each event we calculated the peak of the first derivative of the 
%ΔF/F0 transient at 8 spatial positions (based on breaking the image into a 3 x 3 grid and 
excluding the central square) in the imaged cortical region. We then took the time of the 
peak derivative value at each of the 8 spatial positions during a calcium event. Polar plots 
were calculated by taking the difference of each time-point from the earliest time-point, 
thus generating lag values for each of the 8 spatial positions. We then averaged lag values 
over all the events in the imaged region (10 – 40 events). We calculated the direction 
selectivity index (DSI) for each region as follows: 1 − Rnull/Rbest, where Rbest is the 
interpolated response to the direction with the longest lag and Rnull is the interpolated 
response to the position opposite the direction with the longest lag. Regions of interest 
with a DSI value > 0.3 where considered to have a burst direction. Directionality of 
calcium bursts was not due to scanning artefacts as it did not always follow scanning 
direction. 
Whisker stimulation responses. Following visual inspection of average % ΔF/F0 
calcium data, we found that 1 out of 3 animals exhibited time-locked responses to 
whisker stimulation. To examine whether these responses were indeed sensory driven or 
attributable to the contaminating effects of burst activity we developed a simple metric. A 
trial was considered to be driven by sensory stimulation if it had no response in a ten 
second baseline period, and a clear transient time locked to the onset of the whisker 
stimulation. To test how often our metric gave a false positive, we used randomly 
selected epochs of spontaneous activity that were matched in duration to our sensory 
stimulation trials as a control.  
 
Statistical analyses were performed in GraphPad Prism V7 and SigmaPlot V13. All 
measurements are given as the mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM), unless otherwise 
stated. Results were considered significant when P < 0.05. The normality test used was the 
  
 
10 
 
Shapiro-Wilk test. Figures were prepared using Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator. Images 
in figures 1G, 1H, 1I, 1I’, 1J, 2B (bottom panel), 2G, 2H, 4A, 4E, 4J and S20 are best 
projections in x-y-z of neuronal, dendritic or axonal stacks. Movies S4-6 were processed 
with mean 3D filtering and shown at the indicated frame per second (fps).

Figure S12. Sensory-evoked activity in human tissue grafts.  
(A), Cartoon of SCx1 imaging paradigm for whisker stimulation showing mouse under 
2P microscope and contralateral whisker stimulation via air puffs. Whisker stimulation 
was delivered as 8 pulses in 4 trains delivered over 10 seconds. (B), Example of imaged 
cortical regions taken from a WT-1 graft in the Scx1 of an adult mouse. GCaMP6s 
positive neurons are shown as a maximum intensity projection of activity over a 4 – 5 
min period of sensory evoked activity. (C), Example of %ΔF/F0 calcium traces in 
response to whisker stimulation for 4 active neurons. Responses are the average of 5 
trials. (D), Percentage of trials defined as responsive (see methods) during periods with 
either whisker stimulation (32 ± 12 %, n = 5 regions and 25 trials from one mouse) or 
with no sensory stimulation (5 ± 2 %, n = 20 regions and 100 trials from 3 mice). Trials 
without whisker stimulation were used to define the chance levels of measuring a false 
positive response. The percentage of responsive trials was greater with whisker 
stimulation (unpaired t-test, P < 0.001,). Error bars are mean and s.e.m. Scale bars, 20 µm
