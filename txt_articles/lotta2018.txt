IMPORTANCE Body fat distribution, usually measured using waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), is an
important contributor to cardiometabolic disease independent of body mass index (BMI).
Whether mechanisms that increase WHR via lower gluteofemoral (hip) or via higher
abdominal (waist) fat distribution affect cardiometabolic risk is unknown.
OBJECTIVE To identify genetic variants associated with higher WHR specifically via lower
gluteofemoral or higher abdominal fat distribution and estimate their association with
cardiometabolic risk.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for WHR
combined data from the UK Biobank cohort and summary statistics from previous GWAS
(data collection: 2006-2018). Specific polygenic scores for higher WHR via lower
gluteofemoral or via higher abdominal fat distribution were derived using WHR-associated
genetic variants showing specific association with hip or waist circumference. Associations of
polygenic scores with outcomes were estimated in 3 population-based cohorts, a case-cohort
study, and summary statistics from 6 GWAS (data collection: 1991-2018).
EXPOSURES More than 2.4 million common genetic variants (GWAS); polygenic scores for
higher WHR (follow-up analyses).
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES BMI-adjusted WHR and unadjusted WHR (GWAS);
compartmental fat mass measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry, systolic and diastolic
blood pressure, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, fasting glucose, fasting
insulin, type 2 diabetes, and coronary disease risk (follow-up analyses).
RESULTS Among 452 302 UK Biobank participants of European ancestry, the mean (SD) age
was 57 (8) years and the mean (SD) WHR was 0.87 (0.09). In genome-wide analyses, 202
independent genetic variants were associated with higher BMI-adjusted WHR (n = 660 648)
and unadjusted WHR (n = 663 598). In dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry analyses
(n = 18 330), the hip- and waist-specific polygenic scores for higher WHR were specifically
associated with lower gluteofemoral and higher abdominal fat, respectively. In follow-up
analyses (n = 636 607), both polygenic scores were associated with higher blood pressure
and triglyceride levels and higher risk of diabetes (waist-specific score: odds ratio [OR], 1.57
[95% CI, 1.34-1.83], absolute risk increase per 1000 participant-years [ARI], 4.4 [95% CI,
2.7-6.5], P < .001; hip-specific score: OR, 2.54 [95% CI, 2.17-2.96], ARI, 12.0 [95% CI, 9.1-15.3],
P < .001) and coronary disease (waist-specific score: OR, 1.60 [95% CI, 1.39-1.84], ARI, 2.3
[95% CI, 1.5-3.3], P < .001; hip-specific score: OR, 1.76 [95% CI, 1.53-2.02], ARI, 3.0 [95% CI,
2.1-4.0], P < .001), per 1-SD increase in BMI-adjusted WHR.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Distinct genetic mechanisms may be linked to gluteofemoral
and abdominal fat distribution that are the basis for the calculation of the WHR. These
findings may improve risk assessment and treatment of diabetes and coronary disease.

 T
he distribution of body fat is associated with the pro-
pensity of overweight individuals to manifest insulin
resistance and its associated metabolic and cardiovas-
cular complications.1-5 The waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) is
a widely used, convenient, and robustly validated indicator
of fat distribution and is linked to the risk of type 2 diabetes
and coronary disease independently of body mass in-
dex (BMI, calculated as weight in kilograms divided by
height in meters squared).1-5 This observation has been used
to infer that accumulation of fat in the abdominal cavity
is an independent causal contributor to cardiometabolic
disease. While many studies support this assertion and plau-
sible mechanisms have been proposed, WHR can also be
increased by a reduction in its denominator, the hip circum-
ference. Evidence from several different forms of partial
lipodystrophy6,7 and functional studies of peripheral adipose
storage compartments8-10 suggests that a primary inability
to expand gluteofemoral or hip fat can also underpin sub-
sequent cardiometabolic disease risk. Emerging evidence
from the analysis of common genetic variants associated
with greater insulin resistance but lower levels of hip fat sug-
gests that similar mechanisms may also be relevant to the
general population.11-14
In this study, large-scale human genetic data were used to
investigate whether genetic variants related to body fat dis-
tributionvialowerlevelsofgluteofemoral(hip)fatorviahigher
levels of abdominal (waist) fat are associated with type 2 dia-
betes or coronary disease risk.
Methods
Study Design
A multistage approach was adopted (Table 1). In stage 1,
genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of WHR with and
without adjustment for BMI were performed to identify
genetic variants associated with fat distribution. Stage 1
included data from participants of European ancestry in the
UK Biobank study and summary statistics from previously
published GWAS of the Genetic Investigation of Anthropo-
metric Traits (GIANT) Consortium.16 In stage 2, general,
hip-, and waist-specific polygenic scores for higher WHR
were derived using 202 genetic variants independently
associated with WHR in stage 1. Stage 2 included data from
participants of European ancestry in the UK Biobank and
summary statistics from GIANT.16
In stage 3, associations of polygenic scores with compart-
mental fat mass measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiom-
etry (DEXA) were estimated in participants of European
ancestry in the UK Biobank, Fenland, and EPIC-Norfolk stud-
ies. In stage 4, associations of polygenic scores with 6 cardio-
metabolic risk factors and with risk of type 2 diabetes and
coronary artery disease were estimated using data from par-
ticipants of European ancestry in the UK Biobank, the EPIC-
InterActcase-cohortstudy,andsummarystatisticsfrom6pre-
viously published GWAS. All studies were approved by local
institutional review boards and ethics committees, and par-
ticipants gave written informed consent.
Studies and Participants
The UK Biobank (data collection: 2006-2018) is a prospective
population-based cohort study of people aged 40 to 69 years
who were recruited from 2006 to 2010 from 22 centers lo-
cated in urban and rural areas across the United Kingdom.15
Fenland (data collection: 2005-2018) is a prospec-
tive population-based cohort study of people born from
1950 to 1975 and recruited from 2005 to 2015 from outpa-
tient primary care clinics in Cambridge, Ely, and Wisbech
(United Kingdom).11
EPIC-Norfolk (data collection: 1993-2018) is a prospec-
tive population-based cohort study of individuals aged
40 to 79 years and living in Norfolk County (rural areas,
market towns, and the city of Norwich) in the United King-
dom at recruitment from outpatient primary care clinics in
1993 to 1997.17
EPIC-InterAct (data collection: 1991-2018) is a case-
cohort study nested within the European Prospective Investi-
gation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC), a prospective cohort
study.18 EPIC study participants who developed type 2 diabe-
tes after study baseline constituted the incident case group of
EPIC-InterAct and a randomly selected group of individuals
without diabetes at baseline constituted the subcohort.
Summary statistics from 11 GWAS published by research
consortia between 2012 and 2015 were used in the different
stages of the study (eMethods 1 and eTable 1 in the Supple-
ment). These included genetic variant associations with BMI,
BMI-adjusted WHR, unadjusted WHR, waist and hip circum-
ference from the GIANT Consortium,16,19 associations with
fasting glucose and fasting insulin from the Meta-analyses of
Glucose and Insulin-related Traits Consortium (MAGIC),20,21
associations with triglycerides and low-density lipoprotein
cholesterol (LDL-C) from the Global Lipid Genetics Consor-
tium (GLGC),22 associations with type 2 diabetes from the
Diabetes Genetics Replication and Meta-analysis (DIAGRAM)
Consortium23 and with coronary artery disease from the
Coronary Artery Disease Genome-wide Replication and
Meta-analysis plus the Coronary Artery Disease Genetics
Consortium (CARDIOGRAMplusC4D).24 Data collection took
place from 2012 to 2016.
Key Points
Question Do genetic variants that are related to body fat
distribution via lower levels of gluteofemoral (hip) fat or via higher
levels of abdominal (waist) fat show associations with diabetes or
coronary disease risk?
Findings In genetic studies including up to 636 607 people,
distinct polygenic risk scores for increased waist-to-hip ratio via
lower gluteofemoral or via higher abdominal fat distribution were
significantly associated with higher levels of cardiometabolic risk
factors and higher risk for type 2 diabetes and coronary disease.
Meaning Genetic mechanisms specifically linked to lower
gluteofemoral or higher abdominal fat distribution may
independently contribute to the relationship between body shape
and cardiometabolic risk.

 Detailed descriptions of study design, sources of data,
and participants in each stage are in Table 1 and Table 2, and
eMethods 1 and eTables 1-3 in the Supplement.
Outcomes
Outcomes of the study were WHR (stages 1 and 2b), hip and
waistcircumference(stage2a),compartmentalbodyfatmasses
(stage 3), 6 cardiometabolic risk factors (systolic and diastolic
blood pressure, fasting glucose, fasting insulin, triglycerides,
and LDL-C; stage 4), and 2 disease outcomes (type 2 diabetes
and coronary disease; stage 4).
In stages 1 and 2, WHR was defined as the ratio of the cir-
cumference of the waist to that of the hip, both of which were
estimated in centimeters using a Seca 200-cm tape measure.
BMI-adjusted WHR was obtained by calculating the residuals
for a linear regression model of WHR on age, sex, and BMI.
In stage 3, compartmental fat masses were measured in
grams by DEXA, a whole-body, low-intensity x-ray scan that
precisely quantifies fat mass in different body regions. In the
UK Biobank, DEXA measures were obtained using a GE-
Lunar iDXA instrument. In the Fenland and EPIC-Norfolk stud-
ies, DEXA scans were performed using a Lunar Prodigy ad-
vanced fan beam scanner (GE Healthcare). Participants were
scanned by trained operators using standard imaging and po-
sitioning protocols. All the images were manually processed
by one trained researcher, who corrected DEXA demarca-
tions according to a standardized procedure as illustrated and
described in eFigure 1 and eMethods 1, respectively, in the
Supplement. In brief, the arm region included the arm and
shoulder area. The trunk region included the neck, chest, and
abdominal and pelvic areas. The abdominal region was de-
fined as the area between the ribs and the pelvis, and was en-
closed by the trunk region. The leg region included all of the
area below the lines that form the lower borders of the trunk.
The gluteofemoral region included the hips and upper thighs,
and overlapped both leg and trunk regions. The upper demar-
cation of this region was below the top of the iliac crest at a
distance of 1.5 times the abdominal height. DEXA CoreScan
software (GE Healthcare) was used to determine visceral ab-
dominal fat mass within the abdominal region.

 In stage 4, the risk factors included systolic and diastolic
blood pressures, defined as the values of arterial blood pres-
sure in mm Hg measured using an Omron monitor during the
systolic and diastolic phases of the heart cycle. Fasting insu-
lin and fasting glucose levels were defined as the values of
insulin (log-transformed and expressed in log-pmol/L) in
serum and glucose (mmol/L) in whole blood measured
in fasting state in individuals without diabetes as previously
described.20,21 Triglyceride (log-transformed and expressed
in log-mmol/L) and LDL-C (mmol/L) levels in the circulation
were measured using biochemical assays (triglycerides and
24% of LDL-C values in the GLGC study22) or derived with
the Friedewald formula (76% of LDL-C values in the GLGC
study22) as previously described.
For disease outcomes analyses in the UK Biobank in
stage 4, binary definitions of prevalent disease status and a
case-control analytical design were used in line with previ-
ous work.11,25,26 The definition of diabetes was consistent
with validated algorithms.25 Participants were classified as
cases of prevalent type 2 diabetes if they met the following 2
criteria: (1) self-reported type 2 diabetes diagnosis or self-
reported diabetes medication at nurse interview or at digital
questionnaire, or electronic health record consistent with
type 2 diabetes (International Statistical Classification of Dis-
eases and Related Health Problems Tenth Revision code E11);
and (2) age at diagnosis older than 36 years or use of oral anti-
diabetic medications (to remove likely type 1 diabetes cases).
Controls were participants who (1) did not self-report a diag-
nosis of diabetes of any type, (2) did not take any diabetes
medications, and (3) did not have an electronic health record
of diabetes of any type.
In EPIC-InterAct, the outcome was incident type 2 diabe-
tes. Incident type 2 diabetes case status was defined on the ba-
sisofevidenceoftype2diabetesfromself-report,primarycare
registers, drug registers (medication use), hospital record, or
mortality data.18 Incident type 2 diabetes cases were consid-
ered to be verified if evidence from a minimum of 2 of these
independent sources was present.18 Participants without type
2 diabetes at baseline were randomly selected from partici-
patingEPICstudycohortsandconstitutedthesubcohortgroup
of EPIC-InterAct. Participants with prevalent diabetes at study
baseline were excluded from EPIC-InterAct.
In the UK Biobank, prevalent coronary artery disease was
defined as either (1) myocardial infarction or coronary dis-
ease documented in the participant’
s medical history at the
time of enrollment by a trained nurse or (2) an electronic
health record of acute myocardial infarction or its complica-
tions (International Statistical Classification of Diseases and
Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision codes I21-I23). Con-
trols were participants who did not meet any of these criteria.
Statistical Analysis
In stage 1, GWAS analyses were performed in the UK Biobank
using BOLT-LMM,27 which fits linear mixed models account-
ing for relatedness between individuals using a genomic kin-
ship matrix.27,28 An inverse-variance weighted, fixed-effect
meta-analysis of results from the UK Biobank and GIANT was
performed using METAL.29 This study focused on 2 446 094
common genetic variants in autosomal chromosomes (ie, not
X or Y chromosome) with minor allele frequency of 0.5% or
greater captured in both the UK Biobank and GIANT. Restric-
tion to individuals of European ancestry, use of linear mixed
models (UK Biobank), and adjustment for genetic principal
components and genomic inflation factor (GIANT) were used
to minimize type I error.
Quality measures of genuine genetic association signal vs
possible confounding by population stratification or related-
ness included the mean χ2 statistic, the linkage-disequilib-
rium score (LDSC) regression intercept, and its attenuation ra-
tio (eMethods 2 in the Supplement), as recommended for
genetic studies of this size using linear mixed model
estimates.28 Values of LDSC-regression intercept below 1.5
and an attenuation ratio statistic (a measure of proportional-
ity between LDSC-regression intercept and χ2 statistic calcu-
lated as: [LDSC intercept – 1] / [mean χ2 statistic – 1]) equal to

 or below 0.08 are consistent with optimal control of genetic
confounding.28 Genetic variants were taken forward to stage
2 if they were associated with both BMI-adjusted WHR and un-
adjusted WHR at the conventional genome-wide level of sta-
tistical significance (P < 5 × 10−8 in each analysis).30 The use
of both BMI-adjusted and unadjusted results prevented the in-
clusion of variants associated with higher WHR via collider
bias31 or via a primary association with higher BMI.
A forward-selection process was used to select indepen-
dent genetic variants for stage 2. At each iteration, the ge-
netic variant with the lowest P value for BMI-adjusted WHR
was selected, while genetic variants within 1 000 000 base
pairs either side of that genetic variant were discarded from
further iterations. The resulting list of genetic variants was fur-
ther filtered on the basis of pairwise linkage disequilibrium
such that the final list of independent genetic variants had no
or negligible correlation (pairwise R2 < .05). Full details about
genetic analyses are in eMethods 2 in the Supplement.
In stage 2, polygenic scores capturing genetic predisposi-
tion to higher WHR were derived by combining the 202 inde-
pendent genetic variants from stage 1 (or subsets of the 202
variantsasdescribedbelow),weightedbytheirassociationwith
BMI-adjusted WHR in stage 1. A general polygenic score for
higher WHR was derived by combining all 202 genetic vari-
ants. A waist-specific polygenic score capturing genetic pre-
disposition to higher WHR via higher abdominal fat was de-
rived by combining 36 variants specifically associated with
waist (P < .00025, a Bonferroni correction for 202 genetic vari-
ants, 0.05/202) but not with hip circumference (P > .20, an ar-
bitrary threshold). A hip-specific polygenic score capturing ge-
netic predisposition to higher WHR via lower gluteofemoral
fat was derived by combining 22 variants specifically associ-
ated with hip (P < .00025, 0.05/202) but not with waist cir-
cumference (P > .50, a stricter arbitrary threshold, which was
necessary because of residual associations with waist circum-
ference of a polygenic score initially derived using P > .20;
eMethods 3 in the Supplement). A fourth polygenic score was
derived by combining 144 genetic variants not included in the
waist- or hip-specific polygenic scores.
The statistical performance of these polygenic scores was
assessed by estimating the proportion of the variance in BMI-
adjusted WHR accounted for by the score (variance ex-
plained) and by the F statistic (eMethods 4 in the Supple-
ment).TheFstatisticisameasureoftheabilityofthepolygenic
scoretopredicttheindependentvariable(BMI-adjustedWHR).
Values of F statistic greater than 10 have been considered to
provide evidence of a statistically robust polygenic score.26,32
Statistical power calculations for the association with disease
outcomes were also performed (eMethods 4 and eFigure 2 in
the Supplement).
In stages 3 and 4, associations of polygenic scores with
DEXA phenotypes, cardiometabolic risk factors, and out-
comeswereestimatedineachstudyseparatelyandresultswere
combined using fixed-effect inverse-variance weighted meta-
analysis. In individual-level data analyses, polygenic scores
were calculated for each study participant by adding the num-
ber of copies of each contributing genetic variant weighted
by its association estimate in SD units of BMI-adjusted WHR
per allele from stage 1. Association of polygenic scores with
outcomes were estimated using linear, logistic, or Cox regres-
sion models as appropriate for outcome type and study de-
sign. Regression models were adjusted for age, sex, and ge-
netic principal components or a genomic kinship matrix to
minimize genetic confounding.
In UK Biobank disease outcomes analyses, prevalent dis-
ease status was defined as a binary variable and logistic re-
gression was used to estimate the odds ratio (OR) of disease
per 1-SD increase in BMI-adjusted WHR due to a given poly-
genicscore.InEPIC-InterAct,Coxregressionweightedforcase-
cohort design was used to estimate the hazard ratio of inci-
dent type 2 diabetes per 1-SD increase in BMI-adjusted WHR
due to a given polygenic score.
In summary statistics analyses, estimates equivalent to
thoseofindividual-levelanalyseswereobtainedusinginverse-
variance weighted meta-analysis of the association of each
genetic variant in the polygenic score with the outcome,
divided by the association of that genetic variant with BMI-
adjusted WHR.33 These analytical approaches assume nor-
mal distributions for polygenic scores and continuous out-
comes. They also assume a linear relationship of the polygenic
score with continuous outcomes (linear regression), with the
log-odds of binary outcomes (logistic regression), or with the
log-hazard of incident disease (Cox regression). All of these
assumptions were largely met in this study (eMethods 5,
eTable 4, and eFigures 3-6 in the Supplement). Meta-
analyses of log-ORs and log–hazard ratios of disease assumed
thattheseestimatesaresimilar,anassumptionthatwasshown
to be reasonable in a sensitivity analysis conducted in EPIC-
InterAct (eMethods 5 and eFigure 7 in the Supplement).
In stages 3 and 4, associations with continuous outcomes
were expressed in standardized or clinical units of outcome
per 1-SD increase in BMI-adjusted WHR (corresponding to
0.056 ratio units of age-, sex-, and BMI-residualized WHR in
the UK Biobank) due to a given polygenic score (eMethods 5
and eTable 5 in the Supplement). Associations with disease
outcomes were expressed as ORs for outcome per 1-SD
increase in BMI-adjusted WHR due to a given polygenic
score. Absolute risk increases (ARIs) for disease outcomes
were estimated using the estimated ORs and the incidence of
type 2 diabetes or coronary disease in the United States
(eMethods 5 in the Supplement). The threshold of statistical
significance for association with DEXA phenotypes was
P < .002 (0.05/32 = 0.0016, Bonferroni correction for 8 out-
comes and 4 polygenic scores), P < .002 for association with
cardiometabolic risk factors (0.05/24 = 0.0021, Bonferroni
correction for 6 outcomes and 4 polygenic scores), and
P < .006 for association with type 2 diabetes and coronary
disease (0.05/8 = 0.0063, Bonferroni correction for 2 out-
comes and 4 polygenic scores). All reported P values were
from 2-tailed statistical tests.
In addition to deriving specific polygenic scores, the
independent association of gluteofemoral or abdominal fat
distribution with outcomes was studied using multivariable
genetic association analyses adjusting for either of these
2 components of body fat distribution (eMethods 6 and
eFigure 8 in the Supplement). Adjusting for abdominal fat

 distribution measures was used as a way of estimating the
residual association of the polygenic score with outcomes via
gluteofemoral fat distribution, while adjusting for gluteo-
femoral fat distribution measures as a way of estimating the
residual association via abdominal fat distribution (eFigure 8
in the Supplement).
To obtain adjusted association estimates, multivariable-
weighted regression models were fitted in which the associa-
tion of the 202-variant general polygenic score (exposure) with
cardiometabolic risk factors or diseases (outcomes) was esti-

Six different secondary or sensitivity analyses were con-

other phenotypes including high-density lipoprotein choles-

analysis to associations with height, sex-specific associa-
tions, or the possibility of false-positive associations in stage
1 or stage 2 (eMethods 7 in the Supplement).

Genetic Predisposition to Higher WHR
via Lower Gluteofemoral or via Higher Abdominal Fat
Among 452 302 participants of European ancestry in the UK
Biobank,themean(SD)agewas57(8)years,245 351(54%)were
women, and the mean (SD) WHR was 0.87 (0.09) (Table 2). In
genome-wide association analyses of BMI-adjusted WHR
(n = 660 648;meanχ2 = 2.50;LDSC-regressionintercept,1.098
[95% CI, 1.063-1.134]; attenuation ratio, 0.07 [95% CI, 0.04-
0.09]) and unadjusted WHR (n = 663 598; mean χ2 = 2.68;
LDSC-regression intercept, 1.096 [95% CI, 1.064-1.129]; at-
tenuation ratio, 0.06 [95% CI, 0.04-0.08]), there was evi-
dence of optimal control for genetic confounding (eMethods
2 and eFigures 10-11 in the Supplement).
A total of 202 independent genetic variants were associ-
ated with both BMI-adjusted WHR and unadjusted WHR
(P < 5 × 10−8 in each analysis; eTable 6 and eFigures 12-13 in
the Supplement). These 202 genetic variants were used to de-
rive polygenic scores for higher WHR (Table 1). The 202-
variant general score (variance in BMI-adjusted WHR ex-
plained by score in the UK Biobank = 3.4%, F statistic = 12 231),
22-variant hip-specific score (variance explained = 0.4%,
F statistic = 1550), 36-variant waist-specific score (variance ex-
plained = 0.4%, F statistic = 1444), and 144-variant general
score (variance explained = 2.6%, F statistic = 9177) were sta-
tistically robust polygenic scores for BMI-adjusted WHR
(eMethods 4 and eFigure 2 in the Supplement).
In 18 330 people with DEXA compartmental fat mea-
sures,allpolygenicscoresforhigherWHRwereassociatedwith
a higher abdominal-to-gluteofemoral fat mass ratio, a refined
measure of body fat distribution, but were associated with dif-
ferent patterns of compartmental fat mass distribution
(Figure 1; eFigures 14-15 in the Supplement). The general 202-
variant and 144-variant polygenic scores were associated with
higher visceral abdominal and lower gluteofemoral fat mass
(Figure 1A; eFigure 15 in the Supplement). The waist-specific
polygenic score for higher WHR was associated with higher ab-
dominal fat mass, but not with gluteofemoral or leg fat mass
(Figure 1B). The hip-specific polygenic score for higher WHR
was associated with lower gluteofemoral and leg fat mass, but
didnotshowstatisticallysignificantassociationswithabdomi-
nal fat mass (Figure 1B). Participants with higher values of the
hip-specific polygenic score had numerically higher visceral
abdominal fat mass, but the difference was not statistically sig-
nificant when accounting for multiple tests (Figure 1B).
Associations With Cardiometabolic Risk Factors
and Disease Outcomes
In 636 607 people, the 202-variant polygenic score for higher
WHR was associated with higher odds of type 2 diabetes and
coronary artery disease and an unfavorable cardiometabolic
risk profile (eFigure 16 in the Supplement), consistent with
previous studies of approximately 50 genetic variants.16,26,35
In secondary analyses, there were associations with lower
HDL-C, higher triglyceride/HDL-C ratio, and higher odds of
nondiabetic hyperglycemia (eMethods 7 and eTables 7-8 in
the Supplement). Associations with cardiometabolic disease
outcomes were similar in men and women, with no evidence
of sex interaction (interaction P for type 2 diabetes = .19;
interaction P for coronary artery disease = .80; eTable 9 in
the Supplement).
Both hip-specific and waist-specific polygenic scores for
higher WHR were associated with higher systolic and dia-
stolic blood pressure and triglyceride level, with similar asso-
ciation estimates for a 1-SD increase in BMI-adjusted WHR
(Figure 2A). While the hip-specific polygenic score was asso-
ciated with higher fasting insulin and higher LDL-C levels, the
waist-specific polygenic score did not have statistically sig-
nificantassociationswiththesetraits(Figure2A).Boththehip-
specific and waist-specific polygenic scores were associated
with higher odds of type 2 diabetes and coronary disease, simi-
larly in men and women (Figure 2B and eTable 9 in the Supple-
ment).Thehip-specificpolygenicscorehadastatisticallylarger
association estimate for diabetes than the waist-specific poly-
genic score per 1-SD increase in BMI-adjusted WHR (OR, 2.54
[95% CI, 2.17-2.96] vs 1.57 [95% CI, 1.34-1.83]; ARI, 12.0 [95%
CI, 9.1-15.3] vs 4.4 [95% CI, 2.7-6.5] cases per 1000 participant-
years; P for heterogeneity < .001; Figure 2B).
In a post-hoc multivariable analysis adjusting for visceral
abdominal fat mass estimates, the hip-specific polygenic score
showed a statistically significant association with higher odds
of type 2 diabetes and coronary disease (OR for diabetes per

variant polygenic score showed associations with risk factors
and disease outcomes similar to those observed for the 202-
variant general polygenic score (eFigure 15 in the Supple-
ment). Sensitivity analyses supported the robustness of the
main analysis to sex-specific associations, associations with
height, or the possibility of false-positive associations in stage
1 or stage 2 (eMethods 7 and eTables 9-11 in the Supplement).
In multivariable analyses adjusting for hip circumfer-
ence estimates, the 202-variant polygenic score had a pattern
of association with compartmental fat mass, cardiometabolic
risk factors, and disease outcomes, which was similar to that
of the waist-specific polygenic score (eFigures 8D and 17 in the
Supplement). The 202-variant polygenic score remained as-
sociated with higher risk of type 2 diabetes and coronary dis-
ease even when adjusting for hip circumference and leg fat
mass in the same model (eTable 12 in the Supplement).

that of the hip-specific polygenic score (eFigures 8C and 17 in
the Supplement). The 202-variant polygenic score remained
associated with higher risk of type 2 diabetes and coronary
disease even when adjusting for waist circumference and
visceral abdominal fat mass in the same model (eTable 12 in
the Supplement).
In multivariable analyses adjusting for both waist and hip
circumference estimates, the 202-variant polygenic score was
not associated with risk of type 2 diabetes or coronary dis-
ease (eFigure 8B and eTable 12 in the Supplement).
Discussion
This large study identified distinct genetic variants associ-
ated with a higher WHR via specific associations with lower
gluteofemoral or higher abdominal fat distribution. Both of
these distinct sets of genetic variants were associated with
higher levels of cardiometabolic risk factors and a higher risk
of type 2 diabetes and coronary disease. While this study sup-
ports the theory that an enhanced accumulation of fat in the
abdominal cavity may be a cause of cardiovascular and meta-
bolic disease, it also provides novel evidence of a possible in-
dependent role of the relative inability to expand the gluteo-
femoral fat compartment.
Previous studies of approximately 50 genomic regions as-
sociated with BMI-adjusted WHR16 have shown an associa-
tion between genetic predisposition to higher WHR and higher
risk of cardiometabolic disease,26,35 mirroring the well-
establishedBMI-independentassociationofahigherWHRwith
incident cardiovascular and metabolic disease in large-scale
observational studies.2,3 While these results have been widely
interpreted as supportive of the role of abdominal fat deposi-
tion in cardiometabolic risk independent of overall adiposity,
the etiologic contribution of lower levels of gluteofemoral and
peripheral fat to these associations has not been considered.
Theresultsofthisstudysupportthehypothesisthatanim-
paired ability to preferentially deposit excess calories in the
gluteofemoral fat compartment leads to higher cardiometa-
bolic risk in the general population. This is consistent with ob-
servations in severe forms of partial lipodystrophy6,7 and with
the emerging evidence of a shared genetic background be-
tween extreme lipodystrophies and fat distribution in the gen-
eral population.11 This large human genetic study adds to a
growing body of evidence linking gluteofemoral and subcu-
taneous adipose tissue biology with a favorable metabolic
profile.8-10Thehip-specificpolygenicscoreforhigherWHRwas
not significantly associated with measures of central fat in
DEXA analyses and, in a post hoc analysis, its association with
cardiometabolic disease outcomes was independent of vis-
ceral abdominal fat mass. These associations may perhaps re-
flect the secondary deposition within ectopic fat depots, such
as liver, cardiac and skeletal muscle, and pancreas, of excess
caloriesthatcannotbeaccommodatedingluteofemoralfat.36,37
It has been hypothesized that the association between fat
distribution and cardiometabolic risk is due to an enhanced
deposition of intra-abdominal fat generating a molecular mi-
lieu that fosters abdominal organ insulin resistance.38 The re-
sults of this study support a role of abdominal fat distribu-
tion, but they also suggest that impaired gluteofemoral fat
distribution may contribute to the relationship between body
shape and cardiometabolic health outcomes.

This study has several limitations. First, as this is an observa-
tional study, it cannot establish causality. Second, the discov-
ery and characterization of genetic variants was conducted in
a large data set but was limited to individuals of European an-
cestry. While the genetic determinants of anthropometric phe-
notypesmaybepartlysharedacrossdifferentethnicities,16,39,40
further investigations in other populations and ethnicities will
be required for a complete understanding of the genetic rela-
tionshipsbetweenbodyshapeandcardiometabolicrisk.Third,
this study was largely based on population-based cohorts, the
participants of which are usually healthier than the general
population, and used analytical approaches that deliberately
minimized the influence of outliers, in this case people with
extreme fat distribution. Genetic studies in people with ex-
treme fat distribution may help broaden understanding of the
genetic basis of this risk factor.
Fourth,whilediseasecasedefinitionswerebasedonwidely
adopted criteria, random misclassification of cases/controls
cannot be excluded, which would bias association estimates
toward the null. Fifth, absolute risk increase estimates are
based on incidence rates and ORs calculated in different popu-
lations and therefore assume that these populations are simi-
lar. Sixth, P value thresholds used to exclude associations with
the other component of fat distribution for genetic variants in-
cluded in waist- or hip-specific polygenic scores were arbi-
trarily chosen, but are more stringent than traditionally used
cutoffs (eg, P > .05) and polygenic score results were con-
firmed by multivariable genetic analyses, which were inde-
pendent of such thresholds.
Seventh, this analysis focused on common genetic vari-
ants captured in both UK Biobank and GIANT and, by design,
did not investigate the role of rare genetic variation or of other
variants captured by dense imputation in the UK Biobank.
Eighth, there was a statistically significant difference in the as-
sociation of hip- vs waist-specific polygenic scores with dia-
betes risk, with greater estimated magnitude of association for
the hip-specific polygenic score. However, given that the dif-
ference in absolute risk was small, this observation does not
necessarily represent a strong signal of mechanistic differ-
ence or differential clinical importance in the relationship be-
tween the gluteofemoral vs abdominal components of fat
distribution and diabetes risk.
Conclusions
Distinct genetic mechanisms may be linked to gluteofemoral
and abdominal fat distribution that are the basis for the cal-
culation of the waist-to-hip ratio. These findings may im-
prove risk assessment and treatment of diabetes and coro-
nary disease.
