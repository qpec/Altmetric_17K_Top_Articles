Health Outcomes in Youth
A Meta-analysis
David A. Fedele, PhD; Christopher C. Cushing, PhD; Alyssa Fritz, MA; Christina M. Amaro, MA; Adrian Ortega
IMPORTANCE Mobile health interventions are increasingly popular in pediatrics; however, it is
unclear how effective these interventions are in changing health outcomes.
OBJECTIVE To determine the effectiveness of mobile health interventions for improving
health outcomes in youth 18 years or younger.
DATA SOURCES Studies published through November 30, 2016, were collected through
PubMed, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Educational Resources
Information Center, and PsychINFO. Backward and forward literature searches were
conducted on articles meeting study inclusion criteria. Search terms included telemedicine,
eHealth, mobile health, mHealth, app, and mobile application.
STUDY SELECTION Search results were limited to infants, children, adolescents, or young
adults when possible. Studies were included if quantitative methods were used to evaluate
an application of mobile intervention technology in a primary or secondary capacity to
promote or modify health behavior in youth 18 years or younger. Studies were excluded if the
article was an unpublished dissertation or thesis, the mean age of participants was older than
18 years, the study did not assess a health behavior and disease outcome, or the article did
not include sufficient statistics. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied by 2
independent coders with 20% overlap. Of 9773 unique articles, 36 articles (containing 37
unique studies with a total of 29 822 participants) met the inclusion criteria.
DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS Of 9773 unique articles, 36 articles (containing 37 unique
studies) with a total of 29 822 participants met the inclusion criteria. Effect sizes were
calculated from statistical tests that could be converted to standardized mean differences. All
aggregate effect sizes and moderator variables were tested using random-effects models.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Change in health behavior or disease control.
RESULTS A total of 29 822 participants were included in the studies. In studies that reported
sex, the total number of females was 11 226 (53.2%). Of those reporting age, the average was
11.35 years. The random effects aggregate effect size of mobile health interventions was
significant (n = 37; Cohen d = 0.22; 95% CI, 0.14-0.29). The random effects model indicated
that providing mobile health intervention to a caregiver increased the strength of the
intervention effect. Studies that involved caregivers in the intervention produced effect sizes
(n = 16; Cohen d = 0.28; 95% CI, 0.18-0.39) larger than those that did not include caregivers
(n = 21; Cohen d = 0.13; 95% CI, 0.02-0.25). Other coded variables did not moderate study
effect size.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Mobile health interventions appear to be a viable health
behavior change intervention modality for youth. Given the ubiquity of mobile phones,
mobile health interventions offer promise in improving public health.

M
obile phones are commonly used by health profes-
sionals as a platform to deploy interventions to elicit
health behavior change and improve health
outcomes.1 In the United States, more than 75% of adults 49
years or younger own a smartphone and an estimated 73% of
adolescents own or have access to a smartphone.2,3 More-
over,onanaverageday,adolescentsspendmorethan2.5hours
using a smartphone,4 with their device always in close prox-
imity.Theubiquitousnatureofmobilephoneusecoupledwith
continual technological advances have given rise to a prolif-
eration in mobile health (mHealth) interventions in which mo-
bile devices target a range of health promotion and disease
management foci.5,6
Thereareseveralintuitivefactorsthathaveledtotheexpe-
ditious growth of mHealth interventions. First, mHealth pro-
gramscancollectdynamichealth-relateddataanddeliverinter-
vention content to individuals in their natural environment,
outside of a clinical encounter, at key times that have a higher
likelihood of modifying behavior. Second, the kinds of high-
throughputdatathatareavailablefromsensorsandsmartphones,
includingactivitytrackersanddigitalpillboxes,increasetheabil-
ity for researchers to tailor interventions to participants in real
timetoencourageengagementinpositivehealthbehaviors(eg,
prompt exercise when an activity tracker has been stationary).
Third, the app marketplace has quickly become saturated with
a wide range of mHealth-related platforms because businesses
haverecognizedthevalueofthewealthofdata(eg,dataonpopu-
lationscanbeleveragedforhealthmanagementandmarketing)
that these apps can provide.
To date, however, the mHealth ecosystem has not met its
potential to disseminate evidence-based interventions fo-
cused on health promotion.7 A critical initial step toward fa-
cilitating the maturation of the mHealth ecosystem is for the
scientific community to increase our understanding of what
existing mHealth interventions are most effective and eluci-
date ways that the interventions can be improved. Under-
standing the aggregate effectiveness of mHealth interven-
tions in the empirical literature may help to accelerate the rate
of scientific discovery and then improve the incorporation of
evidence-based practices in the marketplace.
ReviewsoftheeffectivenessofmHealthinterventionshave
predominantly focused on adult populations.5,8,9 These re-
views suggest that mHealth interventions appear to be prom-
ising for a number of health-related areas, including chronic
illness management, adherence, and appointment atten-
dance. A small but growing number of studies have used
mHealthtechnologiesinpediatricpopulations.ThesemHealth
interventions have targeted a range of outcomes (eg, improv-
ing diabetes control and physical activity promotion) and have
produced mixed findings.10,11 To our knowledge, the only
systematic review of mHealth intervention effectiveness fo-
cused exclusively on pediatric obesity.12 Given the burgeon-
inginterestinmHealthandtheincreasingnumberofpediatric-
focused mHealth interventions in recent years, it is an ideal
time to more broadly assess how effective mHealth interven-
tions are at eliciting meaningful change in health outcomes.
The objectives of the present meta-analysis were to (1) deter-
mine the effectiveness of mHealth interventions at improv-
ing health outcomes in youth 18 years or younger, (2) assess
study- and sample-level moderating factors that may be criti-
cal drivers of mHealth intervention effectiveness, and (3) char-
acterize the risk of bias of the extant pediatric mHealth inter-
vention literature.
Methods
Literature Search and Study Selection
PubMed/MEDLINE, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied
Health Literature, Educational Resources Information Cen-
ter, and PsycINFO databases were searched on November 30,
2016, with the assistance of a research librarian. Search terms
included telemedicine, eHealth, mobile health, mHealth, app,
and mobile application. Search results were limited to in-
fants, children, adolescents, or young adults when possible
(eMethods in the Supplement). Only articles published in Eng-
lish were included.
The initial search produced a total of 11 280 articles. Two
additional articles13,14 from a recent review of mHealth inter-
ventions for pediatric obesity12 were identified as relevant to
the present study. After the removal of duplicate studies, the
titles and abstracts of 9773 unique articles were screened by
2 authors (D.A.F. and A.O.). Review articles, unpublished the-
ses or dissertations, and articles that were unrelated to pedi-
atric mHealth were removed. Following this level of screen-
ing,318full-textarticleswereevaluated.Articleswereincluded
if quantitative methods were used to evaluate the use of mo-
bile intervention technology in a primary or secondary capac-
ity to promote or modify health behavior (eg, physical activ-
ity promotion) in youth 18 years or younger. Exclusion criteria
were applied in the following order: (1) the article did not ad-
dress the use of mobile intervention technology in a primary
or secondary capacity to promote or modify health behavior,
(2) the mean age of the participants was older than18 years,
(3) the article did not assess a health behavior and disease out-
come, or (4) the article did not include sufficient statistics to
report effect sizes.
A random 20% of the full-text articles (n = 64) were as-
sessed for inclusion and exclusion criteria by 2 independent
coders(D.A.F.andC.C.C.)toevaluateinterraterreliability.There
was 100% agreement between the raters when assessing
whether an article should be included or excluded in a dichoto-
mous fashion. Agreement declined to 98% with regard to the
Key Points
Question How effective are mobile health interventions for
improving health outcomes in youth 18 years or younger?
Findings Thirty-seven studies evaluating the use of mobile health
interventions in approximately 30 000 participants were included
in the meta-analysis. Mobile health interventions had a small but
significant positive effect on health outcomes in youth.
Meaning Mobile health interventions appear to be a viable health
behavior change intervention modality for youth.

specific reason for exclusion because each criterion was ap-
pliedinorder,makingitpossiblethatraterscouldexcludestud-
ies for different reasons. Twenty-two articles met the inclu-
sion criteria. Backward and forward reference searches were
conducted, resulting in the identification of 14 additional ar-
ticles meeting the inclusion criteria. The final sample of 36 ar-
ticles included 37 unique studies (Figure 1).
Data Extraction and Coding
Calculation of Effect Size
Any statistical information that could be converted into a stan-
dardized mean difference was used in the analysis. These in-
cluded P values, sample sizes, t tests, F tests, odds ratios, and
nonparametric tests. Study effect sizes were calculated using
Comprehensive Meta-Analysis, version, 2.2.064 (Biostat Inc).
Data Extraction Procedures
Two authors (C.C.C. and C.M.A.) and a trained research assis-
tant separately categorized all articles and extracted data using
a standardized codebook. Disagreements were resolved
through discussion until there was 100% agreement.
Extraction of Outcomes
Only variables measuring a health behavior or disease func-
tioning associated with a health behavior were coded. For in-
stance, outcomes could include laboratory values (eg, hemo-
globin A1c level) or behaviors (eg, dietary intake). A total of 93
effectsizeswerecalculatedfrom37studies.Agivenstudycould
contribute more than 1 effect size as described below in the sta-
tistical approach to aggregation.
Aggregate Effect Sizes
Becausestudyproceduresallowedfortheinclusionofmultiple
outcomes,itwasnecessarytoaggregateeffectsizesatthestudy
level before computing an overall aggregate effect size. Includ-
ing multiple outcomes for each study provides a more conser-
vative estimate of the effect of the individual study and serves
as a weak protection against “P hacking” (ie, conducting analy-
ses on multiple dependent variables in the hopes that 1 will be
significant). After aggregating effect sizes at the study level, a
standardizedmeandifferencewascomputedacrosseachstudy.
Assessment of Risk of Bias in Included Studies
The Cochrane Collaboration risk of bias tool15 was used to cat-
egorizeriskofbiasin(1)randomsequencegeneration,(2)blind-
ingofparticipantsandpersonnel,(3)incompleteoutcomedata,
and (4) selective reporting. Categorical ratings of high, un-
clear, or low were assigned for each domain within the 37 in-
dividualstudies.Specifically,ahighriskofbiasratingwasgiven
if the report made it clear that the method used introduced the
potential that the findings could be biased. An unclear rating
was assigned if the report made it unclear whether the study
findings were likely to be biased. The risk of bias was rated as
low if it was clear from the method and reporting that the is-
sues assessed could not have biased the study.
Coding Moderator Variables
Several moderator variables were coded. Intervention length
was coded as a statistically continuous moderator. A categori-
cal moderator indicating whether caregivers were active re-
cipients of the mHealth intervention was coded. Studies were
also coded for the use of only text message interventions in
comparison with interventions that included text messaging
in addition to other components (eg, smartphone apps or on-
line surveys). Another moderator examined whether studies
used a theoretical framework for the intervention. Specifi-
cally, authors needed to indicate in the article that the mHealth
intervention components were guided by a theoretical model
(eg, health belief model). The type of outcome (ie, occurring
once or behaviors that were repeated) was also coded. A sepa-
rate categorical moderator variable was created for studies in
which the mean age of the participants fell in the preadoles-
cence (<13 years) or adolescence (13-18 years) range (eg, re-
ceived a 0 if mean age was younger and/or if only the care-
giver received the intervention). Finally, whether or not the
study was developed with patient stakeholder input or used
intent-to-treat analysis were coded as moderators.
Data Analysis Plan
Studies reporting multiple outcomes were aggregated as a
single effect size in the analysis. This approach helps to en-
sure accurate SEs as well as to reduce bias that can occur by
treating studies as independent when data were gathered from

the same sample.16 Effect sizes were expressed as a standard-
ized mean difference (ie, Cohen d). Cohen17 provided general
guidelines for interpreting the magnitude of study effect sizes
noting that 0.20 to 0.49 qualifies as a small effect, 0.50 to 0.79
constitutes a medium effect, and above 0.80 is a large effect.
Potential moderator variables were tested using the random
effects analog to the analysis of variance technique described
by Lipsey and Wilson.18
Results
Participant and Study Characteristics
Of 36 unique articles, the final sample of 37 studies included
a total of 29 822 participants. In studies that reported sex, the
total number of females was 11 226 (53.2%) and the average age
was11.35years.Therandomeffectsaggregateeffectsizeofmo-
bile health interventions was significant (n = 37; Cohen
d = 0.22; 95% CI, 0.14-0.29). Other relevant demographic in-
formation, study characteristics, and mHealth components for
all included studies are provided in eTable 1 in the Supple-
ment. Reporting of demographic information was subopti-
mal across the study sample. Fifteen studies (40.5%) did not
report mean participant age and 14 studies (37.8%) did not re-
port race/ethnicity. Of participants with race/ethnicity re-
ported, 4887 (43.7%) were Hispanic/Latino, 1616 (14.4%) were
African American, and 341 (3.15%) were white; 4354 (38.8%)
of the participants were of another, unknown, or preferred-
not-to-state category of race/ethnicity.
Risk of Bias
A large proportion of studies was rated as having a high risk
of bias regarding the blinding of participants and personnel (21
[56.8%]) and attrition (16 [43.2%]). Risk of selection bias was
also relatively high (14 [37.8%]); however, 11 (29.7%) studies
did not provide information to determine risk. All but 1 study19
was coded as having a low risk of bias for selective reporting.
The Table provides the risk of bias at the individual study level
for all articles.
Aggregate Effect Size
The aggregate effect size of mHealth interventions compared
with the controls was small, but significant (n = 37; Cohen
d = 0.22; 95% CI, 0.14-0.29) (Figure 2). However, significant
heterogeneity was observed in the effect sizes (Q = 106.40;
P < .001). The amount of systematic variability in study ef-
fect size was substantial (I2 = 66.17), suggesting that modera-
tors of effect size could be used to better understand drivers
of treatment effectiveness.
Coded Moderators
Assignedcodingofassessedmoderatorvariablesforeachstudy
is presented in eTable 2 in the Supplement. Caregiver involve-
ment in the intervention emerged as a significant moderator
in the random effects analysis (P = .05). Specifically, studies
that involved caregivers in the intervention produced larger
effect sizes (n = 16; Cohen d = 0.28; 95% CI, 0.18-0.39) com-
pared with those that did not (n = 21; Cohen d = 0.13; 95% CI,
0.02-0.25). Moreover, the variability remaining in the study
effect sizes was trivial beyond what could be explained by the
moderator. Use of theory to guide intervention development
(Q = 77;P = 0.38),useoftextmessaging(Q = 0.46;P = .50),pre-
adolescent vs adolescent as the intervention target (Q = 3.03;
P = .08), recurrence of the outcome (Q = 0.68; P = .41), length
of study (Q = 0.49; P = .48), use of intent-to-treat analysis
(Q = 0.62; P = .43), and involvement of stakeholders in inter-
vention development (Q = 0.03; P = .84) did not moderate
study effect sizes.
Fail-safe Number Calculation
A number of factors may lead to studies not appearing in the
literature. Some unpublished studies are likely to contain null
findings. Therefore, it is important to understand the num-
ber of null results that it would take to overturn the findings
in the present study. Based on the effect size observed for the
omnibus test, 634 null findings would be necessary to over-
turn the findings presented herein.51
Discussion
The primary objective of the present study was to determine
theeffectivenessofmHealthinterventionsinimprovinghealth-
related outcomes in youth 18 years or younger. Results indi-
cate that mHealth interventions can be effective in eliciting
meaningful improvements in pediatric health behavior and as-
sociated pediatric health outcomes. The small but significant
aggregateeffectsizeofmHealthinterventions(Cohend = 0.22)
aligns well with the findings from previous meta-analyses of
adherence promotion52 and eHealth53 health behavior change
interventions. These findings suggest that mHealth interven-
tions may be a viable modality for health care professionals
to effect health-related changes in pediatric populations.
Moderator analyses revealed that mHealth interventions
with caregiver involvement produced larger changes in health
outcomes, on average, than did those that exclusively tar-
geted youth. Youth health behaviors and outcomes are mul-
tideterminedandinfluencedbyacombinationoffactorswithin
the individual, family, community, and health care system
domains.54 Among these factors, caregiver involvement has
been shown to be an integral component in both health
promotion55,56andchronicillnessmanagementinyouth.57Re-
sults from the present study indicate that mHealth interven-
tions that include caregiver involvement may have an advan-
tage in producing positive health outcome changes in youth.
However, there are 2 important points regarding this finding
that should be considered. First, 9 of the 16 mHealth inter-
ventions that included caregivers targeted children 5 years or
younger—a developmental period during which caregivers are
primarily responsible for their child’
s health. Second, a num-
ber of these interventions focused on immunizations (68.8%)
and were designed so that caregivers were the predominant
recipient of mHealth intervention content (eg, caregiver re-
ceived text message reminders for their child’
s immuniza-
tion). Given the early stage of the mHealth literature, it will be
necessary to replicate and extend this finding to determine

whether the extent to which caregivers are involved in a
mHealth intervention is a driver of effectiveness.
Specifically, it remains an open question whether paren-
tal involvement increases the effect of an mHealth interven-
tion beyond the technology alone when the child or adoles-
cent is the predominant recipient of the intervention content.
Of particular importance will be studies that distinguish the
effect of caregiver involvement in adolescence against early
childhood since developmental stage is likely to be an impor-
tant moderator. These findings fit well with a recent meta-
analysis of health promotion interventions for youth report-
ing that interventions that cut across multiple domains (eg,
family and community) were superior in eliciting health be-
havior change.58 Future research is needed to determine
whethermHealthinterventionsthatincorporateadditionaldo-
mains beyond caregiver involvement may produce greater
changes in health outcomes.
Use of theory to guide intervention development was not
a moderator of mHealth intervention effectiveness. This find-
ing runs counter to previous research indicating that inter-
ventions that incorporate health behavior change theory to
guide development are often superior in web-based studies.1
In anticipation of a modest number of published mHealth in-
tervention studies, we coded studies as using theory to guide
intervention development if the authors broadly mentioned
a theoretical framework during study development. This in-
clusive coding scheme may have attenuated study findings
given that the degree of incorporation of theory into interven-

tions can modulate effectiveness.1 Despite our coding scheme,
most studies (n = 24) were coded as not using a guiding theo-
retical model. There have been calls for the incorporation of
health behavior change theory into pediatric behavioral in-
terventions to increase optimization and advance our under-
standing of which theoretical domains may be integral to
effectiveness.59 Additional assessment of the effectiveness of
mHealth interventions is needed as future studies incorpo-
rate established theoretical models of health behavior change.
Several other coded demographics and study character-
istics did not moderate the effectiveness of mHealth interven-
tions,includingyouthage,useoftextmessaging,typeofhealth
outcome (recurring vs nonrecurring), length of study, and pa-
tient stakeholder involvement in intervention development.
These findings may suggest that mHealth interventions can be
effective for a wide range of youth and for a variety of pediat-
richealthoutcomes.However,theseconditionaleffectsshould
be interpreted with caution in light of a rapidly developing
mHealth intervention literature base. Subgroup sample sizes
across moderator categories were sometimes small, thereby
limiting the power to assess conditional differences in effec-
tiveness. Reassessment of these moderators is needed as
mHealth interventions continue to move beyond text messag-
ing and use differing study designs.
The findings of the present meta-analysis should be in-
terpreted in light of the quality of the pediatric mHealth in-
tervention literature. The use of randomized controlled trial
designs (n = 24) and intent-to-treat analyses (n = 19) was rela-
tively modest. Furthermore, consistent with previous find-
ingsintheadultliterature,5,9weidentifiedariskofbiasinsome
areas that is notable given the small but meaningful aggre-
gate effect size of pediatric mHealth interventions. Our rat-
ings revealed that the most frequent risks of bias among the
reviewed studies were potential failure to blind participants
and personnel, problems with attrition, and potential biased
allocation of participants to treatment groups. We found

infrequent instances of selective reporting. The use of less-
stringent research designs (eg, pre-post) and the frequency of
bias in the extant pediatric mHealth literature are limitations
and introduce a degree of uncertainty regarding the efficacy
ofmHealthinterventionsandthepossibilitythattheeffectsize
will change as more studies are conducted.
These findings reflect a clear need for reducing bias in sub-
sequent mHealth studies. First, participants should be ran-
domized to reduce selection bias. Second, blinding of partici-
pants and study staff to intervention conditions should occur
whenever possible. Although double-blinding is typically im-
practicalinface-to-facebehavioralinterventions,auniqueben-
efit of mHealth is the possibility to develop and deploy atten-
tion control conditions (eg, sham text messages about general
health information vs messages focused on health behavior
change techniques). Third, to reduce bias related to attrition,
participant flow throughout a trial should be clearly reported
and the use of intent-to-treat analyses is encouraged. Fourth,
given that only 37.8% of the studies reported on the racial and
ethnic composition of the sample, assessment and transpar-
ent reporting of demographic characteristics are imperative in
future mHealth interventions. Implementation of these rec-
ommendations and thorough reporting of methodologic pro-
cesses would improve confidence in the reported effects of
mHealth interventions on pediatric health outcomes.
Limitations
Despite the strengths of the present study, there are several
limitations. Due to the modestly sized pediatric mHealth lit-
erature, we were not able to examine the effectiveness of
mHealthinterventionsforspecificdiseasegroupsorhealthtop-
ics, health outcomes, or other intervention components (eg,
personalized feedback). These are important issues to exam-
ineasthemHealthliteraturegrows.mHealthinterventionsthat
did not report on changes in at least 1 youth health outcome
wereexcluded.Althoughthisexclusionresultedinamorestrin-
gent test of the effectiveness of mHealth interventions, stud-
ies that focused solely on changes in knowledge, self-
efficacy, motivation, and other related outcomes were not
included.
Inclusive definitions were used in the coding of modera-
torvariablesforthisinitialmeta-analysisgiventhenascentstate
of pediatric mHealth intervention literature. As previously
noted, broader coding may have reduced the ability to find
meaningful associations between moderators and mHealth in-
tervention effectiveness. Furthermore, some of the modera-
tor categories included a small number of studies (eg, nonre-
curring outcomes). Moderation effects may shift with
additional studies and should therefore be interpreted with
caution.mHealthinterventionstudiesthathadasampleofpar-
ticipants whose mean age was older than 18 years were ex-
cluded from the meta-analysis. In doing so, we acknowledge
that studies that spanned a broader age range or focused on
young adults (eg, 18-25 years) were excluded from analyses.
Finally, the meta-analysis did not focus on the effectiveness
of mHealth interventions to improve mental health out-
comes; this is an important area for future investigation.
Conclusions
To our knowledge, the present study is the first to examine the
aggregateeffectsofmHealthinterventionsonimprovinghealth
outcomes in youth. The findings indicate that mHealth inter-
ventions are a promising and potentially effective route for pe-
diatric health care professionals to use with patients and their
caregivers.Giventheubiquityofmobilephoneuseandthewill-
ingness of youth to use their mobile devices for health-
related activities, mHealth interventions appear poised to be
a viable health behavior change intervention modality. To ex-
tend the promise of pediatric mHealth interventions, future
work is needed to explicitly incorporate and test the effect of
competing and complementary theoretical mechanisms of be-
havior change.59 Moreover, additional studies are needed to
determine the optimal positioning of mHealth interventions
within a larger ecologic context (ie, whether health systems,
families, or schools should be included and the appropriate de-
velopmental levels). To increase confidence in the robust-
ness of the findings, the full extent of methodologic rigor
should be incorporated into mHealth studies. As the research
community executes the agenda outlined herein, future work
will be better positioned to provide policy recommendations
for hospitals and governments seeking to use mHealth ap-
proaches to population-level pediatric health management.
