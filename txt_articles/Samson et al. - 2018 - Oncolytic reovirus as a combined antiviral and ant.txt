ABSTRACT
Objective Oncolytic viruses (OVs) represent promising,
proinflammatory cancer treatments. Here, we explored
whether OV-induced innate immune responses could
simultaneously inhibit HCV while suppressing
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Furthermore, we
extended this exemplar to other models of virus-
associated cancer.
Design and results Clinical grade oncolytic
orthoreovirus (Reo) elicited innate immune activation
within primary human liver tissue in the absence of
cytotoxicity and independently of viral genome
replication. As well as achieving therapy in preclinical
models of HCC through the activation of innate
degranulating immune cells, Reo-induced cytokine
responses efficiently suppressed HCV replication both in
vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, Reo-induced innate
responses were also effective against models of HBV-
associated HCC, as well as an alternative endogenous
model of Epstein–Barr virus-associated lymphoma.
Interestingly, Reo appeared superior to the majority of
OVs in its ability to elicit innate inflammatory responses
from primary liver tissue.
Conclusions We propose that Reo and other select
proinflammatory OV may be used in the treatment of
multiple cancers associated with oncogenic virus
infections, simultaneously reducing both virus-associated
oncogenic drive and tumour burden. In the case of HCV-
associated HCC (HCV-HCC), Reo should be considered
as an alternative agent to supplement and support
current HCV-HCC therapies, particularly in those
countries where access to new HCV antiviral treatments
may be limited.
INTRODUCTION
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is among the
highest causes of cancer-associated mortality and
has limited therapeutic options. The majority of
HCCs are linked with an underlying oncogenic
virus
infection,
namely
HBV
(54%)
or
HCV
(31%).1 HCV-associated HCC (HCV-HCC) has a
particularly high risk of recurrence following surgi-
cal interventions, compared with either HBV-HCC
or other HCC types.2 3 Successful antiviral therapy
prior to hepatic resection and/or liver transplant sig-
nificantly reduces this risk,4 yet toxicity associated
with conventional systemic interferon (IFN)-based
HCV
therapy
has
historically
excluded
many
newly diagnosed patients with HCV-HCC from
such treatment. New direct-acting antivirals (DAAs)
Significance of this study
What is already known on this subject?
▸ The majority of hepatocellular carcinomas
(HCCs) are linked with an underlying oncogenic
virus infection, namely HBV (54%) or HCV
(31%), which drives oncogenesis via both
indirect inflammatory and direct carcinogenic
mechanisms. Accordingly, suppression of HBV/
HCV infections may improve HCC clinical
outcomes, but few patients with HCC
worldwide are cured of their hepatitis
infections due to cost, compliance and
treatment toxicity issues.
▸ Therapy for patients with advanced HCC is
limited; Sorafenib only improves median
survival by 2–3 months, is associated with
significant side effects and has not been
recommended by the National Institute for
Health and Care Excellence in the UK.
▸ Oncolytic viruses (OVs) show potential as
cancer therapies, killing malignant cells by
direct and immune-mediated mechanisms.
What are the new findings?
▸ Clinical grade oncolytic orthoreovirus (Reo)
elicited interferon (IFN) secretion and innate
immune activation within primary human liver
tissue in the absence of cytotoxicity and
independently of viral genome replication.
▸ Reo achieved therapy in cell line and murine
models of hepatitis virus-positive/hepatitis
virus-negative HCC and efficiently suppressed
HCV replication in vitro through the effects of
repressed replication in vitro, and in vivo,
through the effects of type I IFNs.
▸ The antiviral effects of Reo were also applicable
to in vitro endogenous models of HBV-HCC and
Epstein–Barr virus-associated lymphoma. Of the
other OVs tested, only measles virus
Edmonston strain recapitulated the potent
antiviral effects of Reo.

 with improved safety profiles are revolutionising HCV therapy,
yet compliance issues are common,5 and the high cost of DAAs
profoundly limits their use in poorer countries, where the preva-
lence of HCV-HCC is highest.
For patients with advanced HCC, little is known regarding
the impact of antiviral therapy upon existing tumours. Dogma
attributes the emergence and progression of HCV-HCC to a
bystander phenomenon, driven by chronic hepatic inflamma-
tion. However, growing evidence indicates that HCV is also
directly oncogenic, further supporting the need for combined
antiviral and anti-tumour therapy. Specifically, antiviral therapy
improves patient outcomes in HCV-associated lymphoma;6
HCC is more common in HCV-positive livers compared with
autoimmune hepatitis;7 HCV proteins are directly oncogenic in
preclinical models8 and HCV-HCC is more likely to maintain
expression of the tumour suppressor miRNA122, an essential
HCV cofactor, highlighting a critical role for HCV in oncogen-
esis.9 Therapy for patients with advanced HCC is limited;
Sorafenib only improves median survival by 2–3 months, is asso-
ciated with significant side effects and has not been recommended
by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence in the
UK.10–12
T
rans-arterial
chemotherapy
is
routinely
used
for
patients with locally advanced disease/as a bridging therapy to
transplant and has also been tested as a systemic treatment, but is
frequently complicated by reactivation/exacerbation of underlying
HCV/HBV infections.13 14 Thus, given the poor prognosis for
most patients with HCC, a combined antiviral and anti-tumour
therapy might yield significant patient benefit.
Oncolytic viruses (OVs) show potential as cancer therapies;
classically, tumour selective killing arises from direct cellular
lysis expedited by virus-associated traits that favour replication
within malignant cells. However, OVs are also potent inducers
of host immunity, which is increasingly recognised to be the
major component of their anti-tumour efficacy.15 Encouraging
responses have been observed in late-stage clinical testing
without significant toxicity, with the first OV recently licensed
for the treatment of melanoma16 (‘T-Vec’, herpes simplex virus
type 1 (HSV-1) encoding human Granulocyte macrophage
colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF)). The liver and HCC have
been the subject of several OV clinical studies,17 including
JX-594, a modified vaccinia virus (VV) encoding GM-CSF,18
and our own investigations using oncolytic Orthoreovirus
(Reo) in the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC).19
W
e hypothesised that the proinflammatory nature of OV
immunotherapy may exert concomitant benefit upon both the
cancer and the underlying oncogenic virus infection through the
stimulation of innate responses, namely IFNs. Accordingly,
Reo-induced innate immune responses within primary liver
tissue simultaneously effected tumour killing and suppression of
HCV replication in vitro and in vivo. These responses did not
require productive Reo replication and were applicable to other
models of virus-associated tumours. W
e propose that this dual
mode of action, combined with an excellent safety record, may
favour the rapid deployment of OVs such as Reo for disadvan-
taged patients with advanced, virus-associated HCC.
RESULTS
Reo-induced innate immune responses occur in normal, as
well as cancerous liver
W
e previously confirmed that Reo efficiently targets CRC liver
metastases following intravenous infusion, despite patient neu-
tralising antibodies.19 Cell-mediated virus carriage enabled Reo
replication within tumours and recovery of infectious virus from
tumour explants. However, staining of surrounding normal liver
tissue was also demonstrable in a number of patients, but infec-
tious virus could not be isolated. This led us to re-examine
normal liver patient tissue, confirming Reo protein expression
within 5 out of 10 subjects (figure 1A).
Next, we examined Reo infection of normal ex vivo human
liver tissue, generating single-cell suspensions. Mixed liver cells
were fractionated into enriched hepatocyte and liver mono-
nuclear cell (LMC) subpopulations (see online supplementary
figure S1a). Importantly, exposure of enriched primary hepato-
cyte populations to Reo did not cause cellular toxicity (figure
1B), but did result in limited transcription of viral RNA (figure
1C) and protein expression 24 hours post-infection (figure 1D,
E) in the absence of de novo infectious virion production (see
online
supplementary
figure
S1b).
Interestingly,
RNA
and
protein expression decreased between 24 and 48 hours, suggest-
ive of the induction of cellular antiviral mechanisms (figure 1D,
E). By contrast, Reo replicated efficiently within a broad range
of HCC lines in vitro, producing new infectious virions (see
online supplementary figure S1c), and inducing cytotoxicity (see
online supplementary figure S1d), primarily via apoptosis (see
online supplementary figure S1e). Importantly, potent cytokine
responses were observed upon ex vivo exposure of mixed liver
cells, hepatocyte-enriched or LMC fractions to Reo (figure 1F).
All cell types expressed IFN-β, whereas IFN-α and IFN-γ segre-
gated primarily within the LMC fraction, and IFN-λ (interleukin
(IL)-28b/IL-29) was more prominent within hepatocyte-enriched
fractions. Thus, Reo has the potential to stimulate innate immun-
ity within a significant proportion of the liver, rather than being
restricted to tumour cells and/or tumour-associated LMC.
Reo-induced innate immune responses mediate anti-HCC
therapy
T
o assess the efficacy of Reo against HCC models with/without
HCV
, we employed immunocompromised Severe combined
immunodeficiency (SCID) mice bearing subcutaneous Huh7, or
Huh7-JFH1 cell xenografts, carrying a subgenomic HCV repli-
con (genotype 2a, JFH-1 isolate). A single injection of Reo into
palpable tumours (day 5 postimplantation) retarded tumour
growth over a 3–4 week experiment, yielding small, macroscop-
ically less vascular tumours (figure 2A). Histological examin-
ation
of
the
tumours
confirmed
expression
of
HCV
non-structural protein (NS)5A and association of Reo antigen
with necrosis and cleaved caspase 3 (figure 2B). However,
Reo-treated immunodeficient mice developed considerable tox-
icity evidenced by weight loss (see online supplementary figure
S2a), necessitating premature sacrifice.
T
o circumvent toxicity issues and to delineate immune-driven,
rather than lytic therapy, we revisited previous studies in
Significance of this study
How might it impact on clinical practice in the
foreseeable future?
▸ The deployment of select IFN-focused OVs in patients with
cancer harbouring underlying oncogenic virus infections
either as single agents or in combination therapy is
anticipated to suppress pathogenic infections, improving
organ health and extending cancer-specific survival.

 melanoma models, where uv-inactivated Reo (uv-Reo) (see
online supplementary figure S2b) primed antitumour immune
responses comparably with live virus.20 Accordingly, uv-Reo
caused
significant
retardation
of
both
HCV-positive
and
HCV-negative tumour growth (figure 2C). uv-Reo also elicited
innate cytokine responses from primary human mixed liver cell
suspensions,
although
this
was
more
focused
to
IFN-β
(figure 2D). Finally, an immunocompetent HCC subcutaneous
model (1MEA cells in syngeneic Balb/c mice) revealed similar
reductions in tumour growth for Reo and uv-Reo, supporting
an immune-driven, rather than an oncolytic mechanism of
action (figure 2E). Taken together, Reo-induced innate immun-
ity appears sufficient for anti-HCC effects in preclinical models,
independent of Reo genomic replication, pointing to a major
role for such a mechanism in humans undergoing treatment
with live clinical grade virus.
Reo-induced anti-HCC responses require IFN-mediated
activation of natural killer lymphocytes
Histological examination of Reo-treated 1MEA tumours revealed
significant natural killer (NK) cell infiltration, indicating that
these may represent an effector component of the antitumour
response (figure 3A), as seen for other OVs.21 22 Accordingly,
uv-Reo treatment was ineffective against Huh7 xenografts within
SCID/Beige mice that lack functional immune cell degranulation,
consistent with a therapeutic requirement for NK cell activity
(figure 3B). Interestingly, increased tumour growth was not
observed in the SCID/Beige compared with the SCID context,
suggesting that degranulating cells could not effectively control
tumour growth in the absence of exogenous stimulation.
Consistent with murine models and our previous data, Reo
effectively stimulated human liver-derived NK cells ex vivo via a
type 1 IFN-dependent mechanism (figure 3C), thereby activat-
ing a major fraction within the LMC population (see online
supplementary figure S1a). Likewise, uv-Reo stimulation of
LMC also resulted in NK cell activation (figure 3D), as did Reo,
also resulting in enhanced killing of both HCV-positive and
HCV-negative Huh7 targets (figure 3E, F). Moreover, depleting
NK cells from peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) pre-
vented Reo-stimulated HCC killing (see online supplementary
figure S3a), further supporting NK cells as major innate effec-
tors in OV-mediated therapy. Thus, Reo-induced anti-HCC
immunity is dependent upon type 1 IFN, which in turn activates
NK cells, enabling them to recognise and kill tumour targets.
Reo-induced immunity exerts potent anti-HCV effects in
vitro
Given the potent induction of inflammatory cytokines upon
exposure of ex vivo human liver cells to Reo, we reasoned that
resultant conditioned culture supernatants should exert antiviral
effects. Filtered conditioned media (CM) were prepared follow-
ing control, or Reo (reovirus-CM (RCM)) stimulation of mixed
liver cells, fractionated hepatocyte-enriched and LMC popula-
tions or mixed primary HCC cells. All RCM exerted dose-
dependent inhibitory effects upon HCV replication within
Huh7 cells (figure 4A). Comparison with purified, leucocyte-
derived IFN-α, IFN-β or IL-29, or combinations thereof,
revealed a pattern consistent with a primarily IFN-β-mediated
mechanism (see online supplementary figure S4a); IFN-β was
significantly more potent in its ability to inhibit HCV replication
compared with either IFN-α or IL-29, and cytokine combina-
tions did not inhibit HCV replication more than IFN-β alone.
IFN blockade significantly attenuated the HCV-inhibitory effect
of mixed liver cell RCM (figure 4B), with no measurable
cytotoxic or growth-inhibitory effects on Huh7-JFH1 cells (see
online supplementary figure S4b).
Exposure of multiple HCC lines to Reo resulted in variable pat-
terns of cytokine induction, lacking IFN-α, but with significant
amounts of IFN-β and IFN-λ (figure 4C). W
e defined RCM
derived from stimulated JHH1, HLE and JHH2 cells as retaining
high, medium and low IFN-β content, respectively
. Antiviral effects
directly correlated with RCM IFN-β levels, mirroring the trend line
equation for purified leukocyte-derived cytokine (Spearman’s rank
correlation
of
0.929,
p=0.001)
(figure
4D,
see
online
supplementary figure S4a). Concomitant decline in HCV protein
expression was observed by both immunofluorescence (figure 4E)
and western blot (see online supplementary figure S4c), again with
no discernible cytotoxic effects (see online supplementary figure
S4d). Critically
, RCM antiviral activity was also applicable to full-
length infectious HCV
, again with direct correlation to IFN-β
levels, measured by reductions in NS5A-luciferase reporter activity
(figure 4F
, see online supplementary figure S4e), HCV genomic
RNA (see online supplementary figure S5a) and NS5A-Green
Fluorescent Protein (GFP) reporter gene fluorescence (see online
supplementary figure S5b, c).
Reo-induced immunity eradicates HCV from cell culture and
exerts antiviral effects in vivo
W
e next examined whether RCM exposure could effectively
cure Huh7-JFH-1 cells. Huh7-JFH-1 were exposed to RCM or
control
media
for
14 days
in
the
absence
of
selection.
Rechallenge with G418 led to a lack of viable colonies in JHH1
RCM or IFN-β-treated cells, with undetectable luciferase activ-
ity in bulk populations (figure 5A).
Next, we tested whether uv-Reo-stimulated immunity could
exert an antiviral effect in the preclinical SCID Huh7-JFH-1
model. Palpable subcutaneous Huh7-JFH-1 xenografts were
treated intratumourally with either low-dose uv-Reo or PBS
over a 9-day period, measuring tumour growth, as well as HCV
expressed luciferase within tumours using an in vivo imaging
system (IVIS). T
umours were normalised and segregated into
equivalent control/treatment groups based upon IVIS readings at
day 0. While luciferase readings naturally declined in controls
due to the lack of G418, treatment with low-dose uv-Reo led to
a significant additional reduction in IVIS readings, independent
of tumour growth (figure 5B, C). Furthermore, histological
examination of additional Huh7-JFH-1 tumours treated with a
single injection of live Reo revealed marked reductions in HCV
NS5A protein expression in areas of the tumour distinct from
those undergoing necrotic changes or staining for Reo antigen,
supportive of a trans-acting, cytokine-mediated antiviral effect
(see online supplementary figure S6a). Accordingly, RCM gener-
ated from uv-Reo exposure of mixed murine liver cells retained
anti-HCV
activity
in
HUH7-JFH1
cells
(see
online
supplementary figure S6b), albeit significantly reduced com-
pared with human RCM. Hence, while murine RCM/IFN par-
tially cross-stimulates Huh7 IFN receptors, murine xenograft
models likely underestimate the magnitude of inhibition poten-
tially achievable within a human context.
Reo-induced antiviral responses are achievable in other
models of virus-associated cancer
W
e reasoned that similar antiviral efficacy may be achieved in
other models of virus-associated cancer. W
e assessed the effects
of Reo-stimulated immunity against PLC/PRF/5 cells containing
integrated HBV
, and Daudi cells, which are derived from an
Epstein–Barr virus (EBV)-positive Burkitt’s lymphoma, known
to be resistant to Reo-induced cytotoxic effects.23

 PLC/PRF/5 HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) secretion serves as
a marker of viral gene expression.24 RCM derived from both
primary LMC and also JHH-1 cells achieved reductions of
HBsAg secretion comparable with purified IFN-β over a 5-day
time course (figure 6A, see online supplementary figure S7a),
with
no
observable
growth-inhibitory
effects
(see
online
supplementary figure S7b). W
e next tested the ability of Reo to
suppress EBV reactivation from tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate
(TPA)/butyrate-treated Daudi cells. Both direct Reo treatment of
Daudi cells and exposure to RCM derived from PBMC led to a
significant reduction of EBV early antigen (EA)-positive cells
(figure 6B, C). As Daudi cells are not permissive hosts, this
effect was likely attributable to Reo-induced cytokines.
Finally, we assessed whether Reo was unique in its ability to
generate potent anti-HCV cytokine responses from human
primary mixed liver cells. From a panel of commonly researched
OVs,
only
CM
generated
by
exposure
to
measles
virus
Edmonston strain (MV-Edm) recapitulated the anti-HCV effi-
cacy seen for Reo against Huh7-JFH-1 cells (figure 6D).
Exposure to very high concentrations of HSV-1 CM generated
only modest effects, whereas VV did not elicit appreciable anti-
viral responses. Moreover, correlation between antiviral effects
and those predicted to be attributable to the induction of IFN-β
(see online supplementary figure S7c) was significant (p<0.05)
for all OVs except VV; low levels of cytokine were present in
VV CM at similar concentrations to that released from mock-

 treated hepatic cells, yet neither exerted antiviral effects upon
Huh7-JFH-1 cells. Hence, other factors present in control
media may ameliorate the effects of low-level IFN or these low
levels may not tally with the predictive equation (see online
supplementary figure S7c). Taken together, Reo appears capable
of inducing potent, IFN-β-driven antiviral responses that are
effective against both RNA and DNA tumour viruses, yet this
ability is not ubiquitous among OVs.

 DISCUSSION
Here, we have provided the first evidence that OV-induced
innate inflammatory responses simultaneously target onco-
genic virus infections as well as associated tumours using
primarily the exemplar of HCV-HCC, but with additional
proof-of-principle for other models. Induction of type I IFN
was a key, unifying mechanism determining both antiviral
as well as anti-tumour efficacy in our model systems, and effi-
cacy achieved using uv-Reo argues against a significant role
for direct tumour targeting/lysis. Moreover, such qualities

 were not ubiquitous among OVs, making the selection of
agent for future applications an important consideration.
Reo-induced IFN both exerted direct antiviral effects upon
virus replication in vitro and anti-tumour effects in vivo via acti-
vation of degranulating innate immune cells, most likely NK
cells. Hence, SCID/beige mice were unable to respond to
uv-Reo therapy, yet this was not compromised by the lack of
adaptive immunity within the SCID background. NK cells are
indirectly activated by IFN,25 and they likely also contribute to
in vivo antiviral effects via the killing of infected tumour cells/
hepatocytes.26
IFN-β-mediated antiviral and anti-tumour effects in preclinical
models were not dependent upon Reo replication, as uv-Reo
primed similar responses from human hepatic cells. This is rem-
iniscent of other OV studies, where the ability to complete a full
infectious cycle is dispensable for the priming of IFN-mediated

27 Nevertheless, it is likely that
replication-competent virus provides other clinical advantages
when treating preimmune human patients, such as potential amp-
lification at tumour sites,19 and cell-mediated carriage28 to miti-
gate existing antibody responses; whether the latter occurs for
uv-inactivated virus is unknown, and this would currently be
impossible to test in vivo given the absence of clinical grade
reagent. dsRNA human Orthoreovirus genomes are recognised
by pattern recognition receptors, including RIG-I,29 although
whether this is also true for uv-Reo is unclear. Other reoviruses,
such as Carp reovirus, are also known to trigger responses
through Toll-like-receptor pathways,30 yet the extent to which
these are activated by uv-Reo in human liver cells is unknown.
W
e cannot rule out a contribution of adaptive immunity to
therapy in syngeneic 1MEA models, but this would likely be in
addition to the essential innate anti-tumour response.
This
study
provides
a
novel
antiviral
dimension
to
OV-induced innate responses, which in turn also mediate much
of their anti-tumour efficacy. This could have significant benefit
for cancers such as HCC, for which therapeutic options are
limited and the majority occur as a result of either HBV or
HCV infection. Preclinical models available for the study of
HCV or indeed HBV infection/replication remain severely
limited, and all are set within altered genetic or induced
immunocompromised backgrounds.31
32 Furthermore, trans-
genic murine systems that spontaneously develop HCC in an
HCV context necessarily express viral proteins under autolo-
gous promoters rather than in a replicative context, making
these
unsuitable
for
testing
OV-mediated
therapy.
The
Huh7-JFH1 xenograft models employed in the present study
are also limited, but provide the advantage of replicating HCV
within an HCC context, where responses to innate immune sig-
nalling remain intact.
New DAAs targeting HCV have recently been shown to be
well tolerated in patients with HCV-HCC.33 Interestingly, sus-
tained DAA responses in patients with chronic HCV were
recently shown to correlate with restoration of hepatic type I
IFN signalling homeostasis and increased expression of a
defined series of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) upon the cessation
of treatment.34 OV treatment combined with DAAs could con-
ceivably improve the rate at which such intrahepatic ISG expres-
sion takes place, effectively improving viral clearance in patients
with HCC. However, the likelihood is that the majority of
patients with access to DAAs will have their HCV infection
cured prior to the development of HCC, and the accumulating
evidence that HCV is directly oncogenic provides a strong
rationale to adopt the same practice for patients with advanced
HCC. Thus, Reo could have particular relevance in countries
unable to support widespread administration of DAAs, where
both HCV and so also HCC prevalence may be higher.
Furthermore, Reo anti-HCC effects could conceivably support
or serve as second-line therapy to Sorafenib standard of care or
form combinations with trans-arterial chemotherapy. This may
become increasingly relevant in light of recent controversial
studies supporting that DAA therapy may not be as effective as
IFN in preventing the recurrence of HCV-HCC following
surgery, although this awaits confirmation in much larger
patient cohorts.35 36
W
e have previously demonstrated that Reo-induced immunity
is applicable to a number of varied tumour scenarios, and here
we show that this innate immune activation displays antiviral
efficacy. However, this trait was not common to all other OVs
tested, with only MV-Edm sharing the ability of Reo to strongly
induce type I IFN expression within primary human hepatic
cells. Perhaps unsurprisingly, this suggests that OVs hailing from
different virus families may vary in the principal mechanism by
which they exert anti-tumour effects. Interestingly, VV
, the plat-
form for the modified JX-594, was a poor activator of innate
responses within primary hepatic tissue; it is possible that the
considerable array of innate immune antagonists encoded by VV
contribute to this outcome.37 Interestingly, JX-594 therapy
reduced HBV loads in a small cohort of patients with HCC in a
trial substudy, yet this was not directly attributed to hepatic
immune stimulation.38
The clinical potential for Reo to act as a combined antiviral
and anti-tumour therapy in the context of HCV-HCC is sup-
ported by our finding that the virus can access normal liver
tissue as well as tumours, following intravenous delivery in
patients. Accordingly, exposure of ex vivo primary hepatic cells
to Reo resulted in both viral RNA transcription and protein
expression, although this did not culminate in the secretion of
de novo infectious particles. This correlated with potent IFN
induction within normal human liver cells in the absence of
overt toxicity; hence, we infer that such responses limit, rather
than prevent, viral replication within normal in vivo tissue,
whereas this is less likely to occur in a tumour context, thereby
subtly modifying the classical model for OV tumour specificity.
As such, the favourable safety profile of Reo is well suited to the
advanced hepatic disease state in patients with HCC, the major-
ity of whom have underlying cirrhosis. Encouragingly, HCC
biopsies from patients injected with OV in clinical trials showed
diffuse lymphocyte infiltration,18 further supporting the use of
OVs as combined antiviral and anti-HCC immunotherapies.
Based upon their excellent safety records, we propose that the
deployment of select OVs in patients with cancer harbouring
underlying oncogenic virus infections be explored in clinical
trials. Future research should combine IFN-focused OV such as
Reo with other immunostimulatory agents, including immune
checkpoint inhibitors (CI). Interestingly, the converse applica-
tion of CI as antivirals is being explored for chronic infections
such as HIV
,39 suggesting that both Reo-like OVs and CI may
form effective antiviral/anti-tumour combination therapies.

Primary
enriched
hepatocytes
were
treated
with
PBS
or

rypan
Blue (Sigma) and viability was determined from three replicates
of 200 counted cells.
Flow cytometry
Flow cytometry was performed using a BD LSRII flow cyt-
ometer and data were analysed on FACSDiva software (BD
Biosciences). All antibodies comprised fluorescent-conjugated
mouse monoclonal IgG1.
Liver NK cell CD69: washed LMCs were labelled with
Fluorescein

51Chromium release assay
51Chromium release was measured as described.43 Effector
cells (LMCs or PBMCs) were preincubated for 24 hours with
1 PFU/cell of reovirus or PBS and dispensed in triplicate at the
stated effector to target ratios.
In vivo experiments
CB17-PrkdcSCID (SCID) mice were provided by the St. James’
Biomedical Service (SBS). BALB/c mice and CB17 (PrkdcSCID,
Lystbg
‘SCID/Beige’)
were
purchased
from
Charles
River
Laboratories International. SCID and SCID/Beige mice were
housed in isolator cages, while BALB/c mice were housed in indi-
vidually ventilated cages. Cell lines were confirmed free of
murine pathogens (Charles River Laboratories). Mice were regu-
larly examined for signs of deterioration in health or weight loss.
Cell lines were harvested, washed twice in PBS and resus-
pended in 100 mL PBS for subcutaneous injection. All treat-
ments were in 50 mL of vehicle fluid (PBS for Reo/uv-Reo or for
Sorafenib by oral gavage in vehicle; PBS, 25% polyethylene
glycol 400 (Sigma), 5% T
ween-20, 5% ethanol).
T
umour growth was measured in two dimensions using calli-
pers and mice were routinely sacrificed when 15 mm was
reached in any dimension. T
umour volumes were calculated
according to the modified ellipsoidal formula.44
For the IVIS (Caliper Life Sciences), SCID mice were anaesthe-
tised by 1.5% isofluorane inhalation and injected intraperitone-
ally with 80 mL of 150 mg/mL Firefly D-luciferin potassium salt
(Caliper Life Sciences) dissolved in PBS. Luciferase activity was
measured after 10 min. Data were analysed using Living Image
Software for IVIS (Perkin Elmer) by quantifying the total emitted
luminescence within a circular area corresponding to the tumour
injection site and subtracting the background emission.
Statistics
p Values were calculated by the two-sided paired t-test for single
points or groups, and statistical significance is denoted by
*p<0.05. Cells or supernatants were assayed in triplicate when
possible and data represent the mean and SEM between repeat
experiments or samples from different donors.
