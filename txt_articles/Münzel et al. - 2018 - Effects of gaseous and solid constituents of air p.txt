Ambient air pollution is a leading cause of non-communicable disease globally. The largest proportion of deaths and morbidity
due to air pollution is now known to be due to cardiovascular disorders. Several particulate and gaseous air pollutants can trig-
ger acute events (e.g. myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure). While the mechanisms by which air pollutants cause cardiovas-
cular events is undergoing continual refinement, the preponderant evidence support rapid effects of a diversity of pollutants
including all particulate pollutants (e.g. course, fine, ultrafine particles) and gaseous pollutants such as ozone, on vascular function.
Indeed alterations in endothelial function seem to be critically important in transducing signals and eventually promoting cardiovas-
cular disorders such as hypertension, diabetes, and atherosclerosis. Here, we provide an updated overview of the impact of par-
ticulate and gaseous pollutants on endothelial function from human and animal studies. The evidence for causal mechanistic path-
ways from both animal and human studies that support various hypothesized general pathways and their individual and collective
impact on vascular function is highlighted. We also discuss current gaps in knowledge and evidence from trials evaluating the im-
pact of personal-level strategies to reduce exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and impact on vascular function, given the
current lack of definitive randomized evidence using hard endpoints. We conclude by an exhortation for formal inclusion of air
pollution as a major risk factor in societal guidelines and provision of formal recommendations to prevent adverse cardiovascular
effects attributable to air pollution.

Introduction
Environmental stressors represent important risk factors for the
development and progression of cardiovascular disease (CVD).1–5
Recently, the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) Study established
that ambient outdoor air pollution due to particulate matter
<2.5 lm (PM2.5), was the fifth ranking global risk factor in 2015,
causing 4.2 million deaths annually, with cardiovascular deaths
accounting for most of these deaths (Figure 1A and B).6 Importantly,

pollution,
or

which
taken
together,

could
outrank the global impact of many classical risk factors in combin-
ation. Scientific understanding of the scale and scope of pollu-
tion and its association with a much wider range of diseases,
particularly non-communicable diseases have provided a better
framework of understanding of pollution’s true global impact.7
Importantly, while chemicals in the air may initiate or potentiate
cardiometabolic disease, non-chemical pollutants such as tempera-
ture, noise exposure, socioeconomic factors, or mental stress

caused by work strain, grief, or social isolation may co-segregate
with air pollution and potentially amplify associations with dis-
ease.8–12 Alterations in vascular function were the earliest
pathophysiological mechanism described in response to air
pollution exposure in humans, and indeed disturbances in endo-
thelial function are a critical initiating event that is widely
relevant to almost all classical risk factors.13,14 In the present
review, we focus on the evidence supporting the impact of air
pollution and, its particulate and gaseous constituents on vascular
function. We address to what extent alterations in vascular
function are responsible for mediating systemic diseases in re-
sponse to air pollutants. Finally, we examine the impact of mitiga-
tion strategies to reduce air pollution exposure on vascular
function and biochemical pathways known to modulate vascular re-
activity such as reduction in redox stress and/or markers of endo-
thelial health.
Physiology and pathophysiology of
endothelial function
The vascular endothelium represents a biologically active tissue regu-
lating vascular tone, modulating vascular inflammation, thrombosis,
and vascular injury mainly via the radical nitric oxide (•NO).14 It is
also well established that vascular (endothelial) dysfunction develops
in the setting of traditional cardiovascular risk factors including smok-
ing, hypercholesterolaemia, diabetes, and arterial hypertension but
also in response to recently recognized environmental stressors such
as noise and is often the first manifest abnormality.8,14 The alteration
in vascular function has its genesis in the abnormal generation of ex-
cess reactive oxygen species (ROS). This is of great importance, since
the half-life of •NO, and therefore, its biological activity and break-
down, respectively, is decisively determined by ROS such as super-
oxide. •NO reacts in a facile fashion with superoxide to form the
highly reactive intermediate peroxynitrite (ONOO-) in a reaction
that is about 10 times faster than the dismutation of superoxide by
the
superoxide
dismutase
(rate
constant
5–10� 109/M/s).15
ONOO- may act as a vasoconstrictor and most importantly, as a
cytotoxic molecule that causes oxidative damage to proteins, lipids,
and DNA. It can cause eNOS uncoupling and tyrosine nitration of
prostacyclin synthase and manganese superoxide dismutase, thereby
oxidatively inactivating these enzymes and greatly limiting the power
of endothelial mediators with protective function. A number of
superoxide sources have been identified such as nicotinamide aden-
ine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase (NADPH oxidase), mitochon-
dria, and uncoupled •NO Synthase, that depending on the context,
may contribute to excess ROS. Given the fact that •NO release is dif-
fuse, a category of more targeted alterations in proteins such as
S-nitrosylation, commonly referred to as S-nitrosylation, has been
proposed as a stable post-translational modification that directly reg-
ulates vascular and cellular function.16 Defective nitrosylation has
been linked to endothelial barrier dysfunction and may represent an
important as yet poorly investigated link between risk factors such as
air pollution and CVD.16
Air pollution mixtures, chemistry,
sources and exposure assessment
While air pollutants have been reported since antiquity, their sources
and composition have changed, with anthropogenic (combustion-
derived) air pollutants being the current major concern from a public
health perspective.17 Air pollution results from the complex inter-
action of multiple emissions and chemical reactions, and the tradition-
al classification of fine particles based on size or mass may provide an
incomplete picture.5 Over 90% of the pollutant mass in the mixture
in urban settings is from gases or vapour-phase compounds and sec-
ondary pollutants, including ozone (O3), nitrogen dioxide (•NO2),
volatile organic compounds (including benzene), carbon monoxide
(CO), and sulfur dioxide (SO2). Combustion particulates that contain
ultrafines or PM0.1 (PM <0.1lm in diameter) demonstrate enhanced
cardiovascular toxicity owing to features such as high particle counts,
high surface area to mass ratio, oxidative stress potential, high solubil-
ity and charge, resulting in facile distal airway penetration and likely

systemic penetration.5 Air pollution is largely influenced by climate
conditions (some of the most aggressive pollutants being generated
during hot periods with high UV index)18 but also contributes directly
to global warming, which in turn can affect cardiovascular health.19
Air pollution concentration ranges and
exposure assessment
The typical range of ambient concentrations for several air pollutants,
including the latest U.S. NAAQS and the European Commission
regulatory criteria, have been previously reviewed.1–3 Since health
effects of air pollution across large populations cannot be studied
using individual monitoring, models are needed to predict personal
level exposure. Satellite based techniques use the optical properties
of the aerosol column (Aerosol Optical Depth, AOD) to produce in-
direct estimates of ground-level PM2.5 concentrations, which were
the basis of GBD estimates for air pollution. Studies have shown high
correlations between satellite and ground-level measurements for
PM10 (PM < 10 lm), PM2.5, and nitrogen dioxide (•NO2) and are
available for most locations on earth at approximately 1� 1 km reso-
lution.20 These measures of air pollution are typically combined with
data on land use characteristics and emissions sources (e.g. roads,
population density, energy use, land use), to model fine-scale spatio-
temporal air pollution patterns.21 Figure 2A presents an update of the
global estimate of CVD deaths from PM2.5,21 based on public health
statistics of the World Health Organization (WHO) for the year
2015. The integrated exposure-response functions have been
adopted from Cohen et al.,6 used for the GBD of 2015 (Figure 1). The
total mortality rate from CVD is estimated at 2.43 million per year,
with a 95% confidence interval of 1.70–3.08 million per year. These
attributable deaths are based on WHO data for ischaemic heart dis-
ease and cerebrovascular disease (ischaemic and haemorrhagic
strokes). Since the global total mortality attributable to PM2.5 is about
4.2 million annually, the contribution by CVD is about 57%. Note
that in Europe this fraction is considerably higher than the global
mean, being 74%. The breadth and scope of personalized monitoring
devices have also expanded dramatically and many of these devices
can provide unprecedented personal exposure information, in add-
ition to biologic variables such as vascular function, refining our ability
to discern the true impact of the environment on health (Figure 2B).22
Of note, the choice of exposure-response functions, the methods be-
hind air pollution measurement and the study populations are major
confounders explaining the variations observed among the different
large population studies.23 These differences in health impact assess-
ments in large part can help explain differences in estimates (deaths
or life years lost) attributable to air pollution. For instance, when esti-
mates from the European Study of Cohorts for Air Pollution Effects
(ESCAPE) cohort instead of the American Cancer Society (ACS) co-
hort study was used, the attributable burden of ambient air pollution
nearly doubles.23
Air pollution exposure and
cardiovascular events
The association between air pollution exposure, in particular for
PM2.5, and cardiovascular events including cardiovascular mortality,
myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, heart failure including hospitaliza-
tion is strong and is the subject of extensive reviews.1–3,5,24 Just to
mention a few examples, a systematic review and meta-analysis of
studies of short-term air pollution exposures and MI showed that
PM2.5, along with •NO2, and SO2 and CO were associated with
increased risk of MI. The ESCAPE project (n = 100 166 from multiple
cohorts), showed a significant 13% increase in non-fatal acute coron-
ary events, with a 5 mg/m3 elevation in long-term exposure to PM2.5.
Patients with underlying coronary artery disease (CAD) may be at
particularly high risk. The best recent evidence for acute coronary
syndrome (ACS) risk with PM2.5 comes from Utah (Intermountain
Health Care, n = 16 314 patients), where concurrent-day PM2.5 was
associated with an increase for ACS. Excess risk was observed only
among individuals with angiographic CAD, leading to an increase in
ST-segment elevation MI. Long-term survival following ACS is also
reduced by chronic PM2.5 exposure.
The following aspects of air pollution exposure and cardiovascular
events are widely acknowledged: (i) The chronic effects are much
larger than acute effects. (ii) Elderly and individuals with prior CVD
or risk factors such as obesity are at higher risk. (iii) The relationship
between exposure levels and cardiovascular events suggest a ‘no
lower threshold’ limit, with recent studies continuing to demonstrate
a strong relationship at levels below current regulatory limits.25
Pathophysiological insights into
mechanisms of air pollution-
mediated vascular dysfunction
Oxidative stress as a common
denominator of the vascular effects of air
pollution
Oxidative stress is the pre-eminent pathophysiological factor for the
adverse vascular health effects of air pollution, is well documented in
the lungs and almost certainly occurs with immediate exposure.26
The lungs’ endogenous defenses in the form of a protective surfactant
material with a complex mixture of proteins and phospholipids
(which are continually replenished) and alveolar macrophages, pre-
vent the systemic penetration of particulates and reactive gases such
as ozone. Depletion of low molecular weight antioxidants such as as-
corbate, glutathione, and tocopherol with subsequent depletion of
reduced cofactors such as NADPH may result in potentiation of oxi-
dative stress.18 Certain types of ultrafine particles may demonstrate
direct penetration.27 Likewise, surface-bound reactive co-pollutants
such as transition metals, endotoxins, and reactive quinones/alde-
hydes (partially formed by photochemical reactions in the atmos-
phere) may be carried by larger particles and released to the lung
tissue and circulation leading to secondary toxicity.18 Alternatively,
with continual exposure over long periods and/or in the presence of
additional pre-disposing factors, chemical transformation of endogen-
ous molecules may overwhelm endogenous defenses resulting in sys-
temic exposure.26 Chemical transformation of thiols and fatty acids
(•NO2 and •NO); lipid peroxidation, generation of reactive aldehyde,
ketone and endoperoxide fatty acid products; oxidation of thiols to
disulfides or sulfoxides and DNA base oxidation can all occur. The
proposed mechanism(s) of air pollution-induced endothelial dysfunc-
tion and how vascular dysfunction may translate to cardiovascular
events is presented in Figure 3. The model is supported by extensive

evidence from in vitro cell culture and animal studies, human panel
and interventional studies suggesting that both solid and gaseous con-
stituents of air pollution may increase oxidative stress, endothelial
dysfunction, and promote acute and chronic cardiovascular sequelae
(Supplementary material online, Tables S1–S3). The demonstration of
systemic oxidative stress in human studies is somewhat inconsistent
and although there are now many studies, they have been only in
plasma or airway fluid and are dependent on the types of assays
which are sometimes simplistic. The assays used to assess the foot-
print of systemic ‘oxidative stress’ or damage may also significantly in-
fluence the results.26
However, there are several ongoing questions on the specifics of
oxidative stress in response to PM and how it may modulate vascular
function. These include the extent to which endogenous immune vs.
non-immune cells contribute to ROS formation and vascular dysfunc-
tion, the role of pathways in the lung in transduction of air pollution
effects, the contribution of direct translocation of particulate constit-
uents through the lung, and finally, the role of secondary damage
associated molecular patterns including oxidatively modified proteins
and lipids, receptors such as Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and RAGE in
response to air pollution exposure.26,28 While the intersection of
oxidative stress with inflammation is well known,29 the role of sys-
temic inflammation as mediator of air pollution effects in humans is
far from clear. There is clear evidence that most environmental stres-
sors initiate adverse genetic (e.g. epigenetic or microRNA) changes
of signalling cascades leading to an imbalance between ROS produc-
tion and detoxification.30 Also central effects have been described
consisting of autonomic imbalance and hypothalamic–pituitary–
adrenal axis activation that is partially based on the lung arc reflex as
well as potential crossing of the blood–brain barrier by reactive gases,
ultrafine particles and soluble, PM surface-bound compounds such as
transition metals, endotoxins and reactive (photo-activated) qui-
nones/aldehydes (Figure 3).26,31
Animal studies
A variety of different approaches have been employed to study the
effects of air pollution in the experimental context. These may differ
with regards to route/duration of exposure, strain/susceptibility of
animals, source of pollutants, and compositional characteristics of
particles.5,26 Supplementary material online, Table S1 summarizes
selected studies to date that have provided insights on vascular
effects of exposure to either direct installation of particles on intact
vessels or vascular endothelial cells. In general, these studies have
demonstrated an important effect on ROS pathways, while reduction
of ROS sources has been shown to ameliorate endothelial function,
•NO availability, endothelial cell activation (adhesion molecule ex-
pression), and inflammation. Supplementary material online, Table S2
summarizes important in vivo studies utilizing concentrated ambient
particles (PM2.5, ultrafines, diesel, gases, or mixtures). These studies
provide definitive evidence for rapid systemic effects of air pollution
exposure, often within hours, with recent findings in humans suggest-
ing that nanoparticles and their constituents inhaled into the lung
could rapidly cross the alveolar membrane and appear systemically

striction of conduit vessels as well as microvasculature with acute
inhalational exposure. In both mice and rats, sub-acute and chronic
exposure to air pollution alone and/or in conjunction with agents
such as angiotensin II, resulted in increased superoxide (O•-
2 ) and po-
tentiation of vasoconstrictor responses. Several reports have
highlighted amplified endothelin-1/ETA-receptor signalling upon ex-
posure to diesel exhaust and reactive gases (Supplementary material
online, Table S2, Figure 3), which is in line with NADPH oxidase-

abolished by the NAD(P)H oxidase inhibitor apocynin and the NOS
inhibitor N-omega-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME), suggest-
ing that O•-
2 -mediated reduction in nitric oxide bio-availability, due to
NADPH oxidases and uncoupled NOS respectively may be an im-
portant mechanism inducing adverse vascular effects.32,33 Increased
microvascular adhesion of inflammatory monocytes in the adipose
microcirculation has been noted with concentrated PM2.5 exposure,
together with perivascular deposition of mononuclear cells, with defi-
ciency of Nox2 and Tlr4 improving vascular responsiveness.34,35
Deficiency of the p47phox sub-unit of NADPH oxidase also abolished
O•-
2 production in the visceral adipose tissue from PM2.5-exposed ani-
mals and improves insulin resistance.36 While there are limited com-
parative studies of ultrafine particles relative to PM2.5, these generally
show equal or in some cases larger effects for diesel exhaust expo-
sures (Supplementary material online, Table S2). In at least one study,
ultrafine exposure in ApoE-/- mice resulted in greater atherosclerosis
compared to PM2.5. Besides the higher systemic penetration, expos-
ure to ultrafine particles may result in inhibition of anti-inflammatory
capacity of high-density lipoprotein and greater systemic oxidative
stress as evidenced by increased hepatic malondialdehyde, up-
regulation of Nrf2-regulated antioxidant genes and lipid peroxidation
products in the plasma and liver.37,38
All ozone exposure studies to date are acute and are consistent in
showing rapid (hours) endothelial dysfunction and enhanced vaso-
constriction. The mechanisms appear to be related to rapid depletion
of •NO, decrease in aortic eNOS levels, and reversibility with O•-
2
scavengers (Supplementary material online, Table S2). Some studies
appear to suggest factors in the serum that induce endothelial dys-
function and neuronal inflammation. While an endothelial locus of
generation of putative factors that then circulate to cause systemic
vascular and neuronal injury has been theorized, these findings need
to be confirmed.39 In the only primate study with ozone, acute ex-
posure of primates to ozone (0.5ppb) resulted in increased aortic
mitochondrial damage. In one short-term 2-day study, there
appeared to be no additive effects noted in ozone and diesel exhaust.
In general, the concentration of ozone in rodent studies are 0.5–
1 ppm, which is nowhere close to the concentration of doses used in
human studies or for that matter the regulatory standards (current
U.S. National Ambient Air Quality Standard is 0.075ppm averaged
for an 8-h period, while the European Commission has set a standard
at 0.057 ppm). There are too few studies examining the differential
impact of gases on vascular function and those that have been per-
formed
have
examined
a
limited
number
of
endpoints
(Supplementary material online, Table S2).
There have been insufficient studies on the impact of chronic air
pollution exposure on the surfactant milieu. The phospholipids and
surfactant proteins, which are an important line of defence, are con-
tinually replenished and provide a potent barrier against air pollution;
even those that manage to penetrate the distal airways. However,
chronic ongoing exposure to air pollution may overcome surfactant
defenses18 and increase oxidatively modified derivatives of 1-palmi-
toyl-2-arachidonyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphorylcholine (PAPC) and the
major oxidation product of cholesterol, 7-ketocholesterol. These
processes may participate in endothelial barrier dysfunction, inflam-
matory cell recruitment (Figure 3), and facilitate transition of air pollu-
tants, chemokines, and other secondary mediator signals to the bone
marrow and systemic circulation.34 These mediators may enhance
oxidative stress in the vasculature via activation of TLR4 pathways in
monocytes and macrophages.13,40 Deficiency of TLR4, NOX2, and
p47phox have all been shown to attenuate ROS generation, reduce in-
flammatory monocyte infiltration into vasculature and improve vas-
cular function in response to inhalational exposure to concentrated
PM2.5.34,36 The formation of 7-ketocholesterol in response to chronic
PM2.5 exposure and its accumulation within low-density lipoprotein
and subsequent uptake by CD36, a scavenger receptor recognizing
specific oxidized phospholipids and lipoproteins, facilitating entrap-
ment within plaque macrophages, may represent a paradigm for air
pollution mediated endothelial dysfunction and promotion of athe-
rosclerosis.41,42 Impairment of endothelial regeneration owing to de-
pletion of endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) may also represent an
important
mechanism
of
sustained
endothelial
dysfunction
(Supplementary material online, Table S2).
Two recent studies provide evidence that the pulmonary anti-
oxidant
barrier
may
be
critical
in
modulation
of
systemic
responses.43,44 In the first study, exposure to concentrated ambient
PM2.5 (CAP) reduced insulin-stimulated Akt/eNOS activation in the
aorta in 9 days, an effect reversed by the antioxidant TEMPOL or
lung-specific overexpression of extracellular SOD.43 In the second
study, a similar 9-day exposure to CAP reduced EPCs, VEGF (vascu-
lar endothelial growth factor)-stimulated aortic Akt phosphorylation,
and plasma •NO levels in wild-type mice, but not in mice overex-
pressing extracellular superoxide dismutase (ecSOD-Tg) in the lungs.
Further, EPCs from CAP-exposed wild-type mice failed to augment
hindlimb perfusion when injected into unexposed mice subjected to
hindlimb ischaemia. In contrast, EPCs derived from CAP-exposed
ecSOD-Tg mice restored hind limb ischaemia.44 Adverse remodelling
and fibrotic/atherosclerotic processes conferred by matrix metallo-
proteinases and TIMP-1 further contribute to endothelial and vascu-
lar damage (Supplementary material online, Table S2).
Activation of sympathetic nervous system and hypothalamic in-
flammation occurs in response to PM2.5 exposure with potentiation
of blood pressure responses.45 Air pollutants can penetrate the cen-
tral nervous system, inducing inflammation in areas of the central ner-
vous system responsible for blood pressure regulation and metabolic
control.1,26,46,47 Receptors such as the transient receptor potential
cation channel, subfamily A, member 1 (TRPA1) receptors in airway
sensory neurons can also sense the environmental toxicants and
aerogenic oxidants, resulting in neurogenic inflammation.48 Inhibition
of central IKKb, prevented peripheral inflammation and abnormalities
such as insulin resistance and whole body metabolism.40,45

depend on multiple factors, including chemical composition of the air
pollutants, associated co-pollutants and host susceptibility.26 The evi-
dence for changes in vascular function in panel studies where exam-
ined, has demonstrated associations across multiple acute time
windows across a range of concentrations, including most recently
with very high exposure levels in China (Supplementary material on-
line, Table S3). Both the MESA-Air and the Framingham cohort have
demonstrated that long-term exposures to ambient levels of PM2.5
are linked to chronic reductions in brachial endothelial function.49,50
Collectively, this supports the concept that air pollution exposure in
humans through changes in oxidative stress causes vascular endothe-
lial dysfunction, the hallmark physiological change underlying the initi-
ation and progression of atherosclerosis. Platelet activation seems to
be
another
hallmark
of
air
pollution
exposure
in
humans
(Supplementary material online, Table S3).51
There have been insufficient studies on the impact of effect
modifiers that may determine individual patient susceptibility.
Polymorphisms in several oxidative stress-related genes such as
GSTM1, GSTP1, GSTT1, HFE C282Y, CAT, and heme oxygenase
have been found to be associated with the vulnerability to
PM2.5.26
Controlled exposure studies
Several controlled exposure studies demonstrate that acute ex-
posure to PM2.5 and dilute diesel exhaust result in rapid vascular
dysfunction that manifests as conduit or microvascular endothelial
dysfunction, or transient constriction of a peripheral conduit ves-
sel that is reversible (Supplementary material online, Table S3). In
some of these studies, concentrated PM2.5 exposure diminished
conduit artery endothelial-dependent vasodilatation in a delayed
fashion, after 24 h (but not immediately).52 PM2.5 mass and TNF-a
level post-exposure have both been associated with the degree of
endothelial dysfunction, suggesting that systemic inflammation
induced by particles and the degree of pollution are likely
responsible.52 Concentrated PM2.5 has not always been shown to
induce endothelial dysfunction, underscoring the importance of
composition, individual propensity, and methods of determining
endothelial function, among many factors that determine vascular
response.53 Studies of ultrafine particles including inhalation of
elemental carbon as well as diluted diesel exhaust have been
shown to induce rapid endothelial dysfunction in the micro-
circulation.54,55 The blunted responses to acetylcholine often per-
sists for 24 h in healthy adults following cessation of exposure.56
In a randomized controlled clinical trial, diesel exhaust (200 mg/
m3 of fine particulate matter), or filtered air increased blood pres-
sure rapidly with persistent effects.57 Exercise-induced ST-seg-
ment depression and ischaemic burden were significantly greater
during diesel exhaust exposure compared with filtered air
exposure.58 Further analyses revealed that diesel exhaust but
not filtered diesel exhaust causes impaired vasodilation to
the
endothelium-dependent
vasodilators
bradykinin
and
acetylcholine.59 In addition, in vitro organ chamber experiments
with isolated vessels demonstrated that diesel exhaust particles
and not carbon nanoparticles induce endothelial dysfunction, an
effect that was markedly improved by the administration of super-
oxide dismutase suggesting that reduced vascular •NO bioavail-
ability is likely due to increased production of O•-
2 ,59 although
vascular •NO production by the •NO-synthase actually seems to
be increased.60
Ozone exposures have been shown to impair conduit vessel
endothelial function in panel studies (Supplementary material online,
Table S3). However, acute exposure at least in one study did not
demonstrate abnormalities in endothelial function. Similarly, many
panel studies have demonstrated an association between NO2
levels, while, acute exposure to •NO2 failed to cause endothelial
dysfunction in man.61 There are currently insufficient controlled
interventional studies on other gaseous co-pollutants such as •NO2
and sulfur dioxide although the data at least from animals
seems to suggest that these by themselves are less harmful but rather
it is the associated co-pollutants admixture that may exert toxic
effects.17
In summary, the preponderance of evidence supports an effect of
particulate air pollutants on endothelial function in both conduit and
resistance vessels, including the coronary circulation. Endothelial dys-
function may result in changes in arterial stiffness and afterload, that
may translate into persistent hypertension with chronic exposure.
Air pollution exposure, indeed, is associated with incident hyperten-
sion at both low levels and high levels with associations with traffic
related air pollutants being strong.24,62 Chronic alterations in endo-
thelial function and blood pressure may indeed represent an import-
ant mechanism for accelerated atherosclerosis. In the largest study,
linking chronic exposures to coronary artery calcium (MESA-Air co-
hort, n = 6795 across 6 U.S. regions), each 5 mg/m3 increase in long-
term PM2.5 exposure was associated with a greater progression of
CAC (4.1 Agatston units/year).63
Air pollutants and cardiovascular
risk factors
PM2.5 inhalation promotes not only acute elevations in blood
pressure over hours-to-days but also chronic development of
hypertension per se. This has been the topic of multiple system-
atic reviews and meta-analyses. One study that assessed the
chronic (lifelong exposure) over >50 weeks in an animal model
noted evidence of left ventricular hypertrophy, diastolic dys-
function, abnormalities in flow reserve, and molecular changes
in the myocardium including foetal gene expression and in-
crease in SERCA2a levels.64 This finding is supported by epi-
demiological studies linking traffic air pollutants and PM2.5 with
left and ventricular structural changes (MESA-Air and the
Jackson Heart Study).24 Similarly, PM2.5 has been associated
with the development of insulin resistance, a finding that has
been corroborated by epidemiologic evidence.47 While the
mechanisms are likely multifactorial, given the widely accepted
link between insulin resistance and endothelial dysfunction and
the broad recognition that insulin’s action to enhance its own
vascular delivery (and that of its substrates) is integral to its
overall action, it is likely that insulin resistance is a direct conse-
quence of air pollution mediated endothelial dysfunction.65,66
Also obesity26 and thrombosis51 are consequences of air pollu-
tion and represent important triggers of atherosclerosis leading
to manifest cardiovascular events such as stroke, ACS, arrhyth-
mia and heart failure (Figure 3).

Effects of air pollution mitigation
on cardiovascular intermediate
outcomes
The significant improvements in air quality during the past few deca-
des has now been shown to translate into an increase in overall life
expectancy and do so with no increase in economic costs.1,7 Further,
improvement in air quality besides, the health co-benefit may bring
much needed focus on issues such as global warming. Unfortunately,
population growth, increasing energy and transportation demands,
and numerous geopolitical-economic factors continue to delay
improvements in air quality in many parts of the world. Unless some
actions are taken to protect the health of millions of at-risk individu-
als, the burden of air pollution-related cardiometabolic diseases will
only further increase. In this regard, personal protection through the
use of masks, filtration devices and other strategies to reduce person-
al exposure are the only bulwark to protect individuals at risk for air
pollution mediated CVD (Supplementary material online, Table S4).
Several ‘personal-level’ strategies including drugs have been shown to
reduce exposures and to improve adverse effects including vascular
function, blood pressure, heart rate variability, and other intermedi-
ate outcomes.2
Air pollution and cardiovascular
risk: a role for the cardiovascular
community and society at large
Despite the overwhelming evidence concerning the detrimental
effects of air pollution on cardiovascular health including develop-
ment of risk factors such as hypertension and diabetes, as well as car-
diovascular events, there are no randomized controlled trials that
have investigated the efficacy of pollution-directed interventions on
cardiovascular outcomes such as stroke, ischaemic heart disease,
heart failure, arrhythmia, and all-cause cardiovascular mortality.24,67
Further research is needed to identify interventions that reduce risk
to pollution exposures such as improved ventilation and indoor air fil-
tration systems, facemasks and medicines to reduce impact of air pol-
lution and also harmonization of risk assessment models is urgently
needed. There is little mention of this risk factor in the European and
American guidelines. The ESC Guidelines for prevention only men-
tion that air pollution can adversely affect cardiovascular health68 but
to date do not provide concrete recommendations on what the indi-
vidual can do to mitigate risk and what solutions can be provided to
governmental and non-profit agencies to impact air pollution levels
and to protect societal health. It would be important that legal PM2.5
thresholds worldwide adhere to the WHO air quality guidelines in
the future since those in Europe are still high (25 mg/m3) when com-
pared with those in Canada and the USA (10–12mg/m3). It is only a
matter of time that the continued drumbeat of evidence will have to
persuade the cardiovascular community that concrete guidance on
personal and societal mitigation of the threat of air pollution may
need to be part of parcel of guidance on cardiovascular risk preven-
tion. We have to acknowledge that air pollution is a cardiovascular
risk factor, that governments and non-profit organizations may need
to focus on and not simply health professionals. Given the multiple
constraints faced by health care providers, identification of target
patients most likely to benefit from intervention could be facilitated
as an initial step to protect vulnerable patients. Quantitative estimates
of at risk populations and translation of exposures into individual esti-
mates of risk may be possible in the future with personalized
approaches.69 Finally, broad societal based interventions are manda-
tory to tackle the risk posed by air pollution.
