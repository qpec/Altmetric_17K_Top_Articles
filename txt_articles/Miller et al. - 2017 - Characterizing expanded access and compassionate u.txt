Abstract 
Objective: We sought to determine the characteristics of “expanded access” and “compassionate use” programs regis-
tered in ClinicalTrials.gov and to determine the percentage of drugs provided through these programs that ultimately 
received FDA marketing approval.
Results: We identified 398 expanded access and compassionate use programs (hereafter referred to as expanded 
access programs) registered on ClinicalTrials.gov. Industry funded 61% (n = 241) of programs individually or collabo-
ratively, while NIH and the US Federal Government rarely funded programs (3% [n = 11] and 2% [n = 6], respectively). 
Most programs provided access to drugs (71% [n = 282]), 11% to biologics (n = 43), and 10% to medical devices 
(n = 40). These programs covered 460 unique conditions, the most common being HIV (n = 26), leukemia (22), and 
multiple myeloma (n = 14). Only 2% of programs reported results in ClinicalTrials.gov. Most programs (82%) were 
open to enrolling adults and seniors (n = 326). These programs provided access to 210 unique experimental drugs, of 
which 76% have received FDA approval.

Introduction
Proposed federal Right to Try legislation, advocated 
by the White House, [1] allows physicians to prescribe 
experimental therapies unapproved by the U.S. Food and 
Drug Administration (FDA) to terminally ill patients. 
Proponents say these laws, which have already passed 
in 36 states, are vital to providing potentially lifesaving 
therapies to terminally ill patients who do not qualify for 
clinical trials. Critics contend patients can already access 
experimental drugs through the FDA’s Expanded Access 
Program, which grants 99% of requests but depends on 
consent by medical product manufactures [2].
Expanded access programs, sometimes also called 
“compassionate use” programs, provide patients with 
serious or immediately life threatening diseases or con-
ditions access to investigational products outside of 
clinical trials. Under the current Federal Food, Drug, and 
Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act), patients seeking expanded 
access generally need their physician to determine they 
have no alternative available therapy and no access to a 
clinical trial for their disease or condition. Additionally, 
the patient’s treating physician must agree to apply for 
expanded access on their behalf and the medical product 
company must agree to provide the investigational drug 
[3]. Currently, a company can decline a request or it can 
approve the request, but is not obligated to provide the 
drug for free [4].
Much of the scholarly literature on expanded access 
programs focuses on the role of the FDA [5, 6] or other 
regulatory bodies [7] in providing patients access to 
experimental drugs, or the ethics [8–10] and legal 
aspects of these programs [11, 12]. A few papers also 
explore the role of social media and patient advocacy in 
fostering pre-approval access [13, 14]. Very few papers

provide empirical data or data-driven characterizations 
of expanded access programs.
The main, perhaps only, empirical paper on expanded 
access programs was published by the FDA. It details 
how many expanded access requests it received over the 
last ten years and their rate and handling of approvals 
(99% of requests were approved) [15]. In general, the lit-
erature provides little to no insight on the characteristics 
of these programs or whether the provided experimental 
drugs ever receive FDA approval.
Given the contentious debate surrounding the Right 
to Try laws [16] and lack of empirical information about 
expanded access programs in the literature, we sought to 
determine the characteristics of “expanded access” and 
“compassionate use” programs registered in ClinicalTri-
als.gov, the trial registry maintained by the U.S. National 
Institutes of Health (NIH). We also sought to determine 
the percentage of drugs provided through these pro-
grams that ultimately received FDA marketing approval.
Main text
Methods
We searched ClinicalTrials.gov to identify all expanded 
access and compassionate use programs registered by 
July 1, 2016. After identifying all relevant trials in the 
ClinicalTrials.gov database using the search terms “com-
passionate use” and “expanded access” we reviewed tri-
als manually for relevance and removed duplicate trials 
(trials listed multiple times under the same NCT num-
ber). ClinicalTrials.gov is a publicly available registry and 
database maintained by the National Library of Medicine 
(NLM) at the National Institutes of Health (NIH), created 
in 1997 as a results of the Food and Drug Administration 
Modernization Act of 1997 (FDAMA).
For each identified program, we abstracted the pro-
gram’s registration date, funding source, product type 
(drug, biologic or device), condition treated, patient age, 
number patients enrolled, whether the program was for a 
single or multiple patients, and reporting of trial results.
For drugs only, we determined FDA approval rates by 
cross-referencing the drug provided in the expanded 
access program with Drugs@FDA. Drugs@FDA is a 
public database maintained by the US FDA, listing most 
drug products approved by the FDA since 1939. We used 
descriptive statistics, such as means, proportions, and 
medians, and all analyses were performed using Micro-
soft Excel v2013 (Redmond, Washington).
Results
We found 527 trials using our search criteria on Clini-
calTrials.gov. After removing 54 duplicate trials and 75 
irrelevant trials, 398 programs met our final inclusion 
criteria as compassionate use (CU) or expanded access 
(EA) programs (hereafter referred to as expanded access 
programs). Of these 398 programs, 306 were labeled as 
expanded access only programs, 49 were compassionate 
use only, and 43 programs used both terms. The earli-
est recorded program started in June of 1989. It was for 
“Compassionate use of tetrabenazine in the treatment of 
abnormal movements,
” sponsored by Baylor College of 
Medicine.
Industry funded 61% (n = 241) of the 398 programs 
individually or collaboratively. In contrast, the NIH and 
the US Federal Government rarely funded programs 
(3% [n = 11] and 2% [n = 6], respectively) (Table 1). 36% 
of programs are classified as funded by an institution 
“Other” than the Industry, NIH, or US Federal Govern-
ment. The “Other” category generally refers to university 
or academic sponsors.
Most programs [71% (n = 282)] provided access to 
drugs, 11% biologics (n = 43), and 10% medical devices 
(n = 40). These programs covered 460 unique conditions, 
the most common being HIV (n = 26), leukemia (22), 
and multiple myeloma (n = 14). Most programs (82%) 
were open to enrolling adults and seniors (n = 326). 
Several registration fields lacked data. For example, 80% 
didn’t indicate whether the program was single-patient 
or multi-patient, 74% lacked phase data, and 98% had no 
reported results (n = 390).
The FDA subsequently granted marketing approval for 
drugs provided in 68% (n = 192) of expanded access pro-
grams. These programs provided access to 210 unique 
experimental drugs, of which 76% (n = 160 of 210) have 
received FDA approval. We did not analyze FDA approval 
rates for the biologics or devices.
Discussion
Nearly 400 expanded access and compassionate use pro-
grams were registered on ClinicalTrials.gov as of July 
2016. Most programs were sponsored by medical prod-
uct manufacturers. This suggests that even without fed-
eral Right to Try legislation, the pharmaceutical industry 
is establishing programs to make experimental therapies 
available to terminally ill patients.
Most (76%) provided drugs in expanded access pro-
grams eventually received FDA approval. Thus, provided 
drugs in registered expanded access programs are, more 
times than not, eventually deemed safe by the FDA. Not-
withstanding, the fact that nearly 25% of expanded access 
drugs have yet to receive FDA approval, shows that we 
cannot entirely eliminate safety and efficacy questions in 
expanded access and compassionate use programs.
It is reasonable to allow the FDA to retain its over-
sight and approval role for these programs, in order to 
help mitigate safety risks for patients- especially since 
it approves 99% of expanded access and compassionate

use requests. Currently, patients wishing to gain access 
to experimental drugs through compassionate use and 
expanded access programs, must obtain FDA approval. 
Proposed Right to Try Legislation generally removes this 
step of needing FDA oversight and approval.
Legislative efforts should also aim to expand patient 
access to clinical trials, which in some cases could 
alleviate the need for expanded access and compassion-
ate use programs. Currently, clinical trial access is often 
limited by several factors, including a patient’s location, 
age, and health status [17]. Most clinical trials enroll 
younger, healthier, and whiter patients than the typi-
cal patient population [18–20]. The 21st Century Cures 
Act makes some progress in expanding access to clinical 
trials.
Expanded access programs raise broader ethical and 
regulatory questions, including whether (and how much) 
product manufactures should re-direct investigational 
products and resources from formal clinical trials to 
patients requesting expanded access and how to finance 
these programs. In addition, experts are using [21] or 
advocating the use [22] of expanded access programs as 
“real world evidence” for drug safety or efficacy. While 
the reliability of using these data for this purpose is 
debatable, it’s worth noting that, thus far, we found only 
2% of programs reported results in ClinicalTrials.gov.
Limitations
Important information about expanded access and com-
passionate use programs was frequently missing from 
ClinicalTrials.gov, limiting precise insight into exactly 
which patients and how many are accessing experimen-
tal agents. This limitation should decrease over time. The 
FDA Amendments Act (FDAAA) final rule, released in 
September 2016, newly requires expanded access pro-
grams be registered on ClinicalTrials.gov and be kept 
up-to-date. Thus, ClinicalTrials.gov should improve in 
robustness over time for understanding U.S. expanded 
access programs.
