Abstract
Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder, diagnosed behaviorally by social and communication 
deficits, repetitive behaviors and restricted interests. Recent genome-wide exome sequencing has 
revealed extensive overlap in risk genes for autism and for cancer. Understanding the genetic 
commonalities of autism(s) and cancer(s), with a focus on mechanistic pathways, could lead to 
repurposed therapeutics.
Keywords
Autism; cancer; gene; signaling pathway; chromatin remodeling; DNA repair
Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder, diagnosed by behavioral symptoms including 
impaired social interactions and communication, repetitive behaviors and restricted interests 
[1]. Extraordinarily high heritability for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has been detected 
in twin studies, with a range of 50–90% concordance between monozygotic twins, as 
compared to 0–30% between dizygotic twins and siblings, and approximately 1% 
prevalence in the general population, along with a high male:female ratio [2]. International 
consortia searching for the genetic causes of ASD quickly recognized that autism is not a 
monogenic disorder. Hundreds of de novo and familial risk genes, copy number variants and 
epigenetic modifiers have been identified through linkage analysis, genome wide-
association studies, exon and whole genome sequencing of individuals with ASD over the 
last 2 years [2–5].

 Table 1 summarizes the characteristics of risk genes for ASD that are also risk genes for 
cancers, extending the original finding that the PI3K-Akt-mTOR signaling axis (involving 
PTEN, FMR1, NF1, TSC1, TSC2) was associated with inherited risk for both cancer and 
ASD [6–9]. Recent genome-wide exome sequencing studies of de novo variants in ASD and 
cancer have begun to uncover considerable additional overlap. What is surprising about the 
genes in Table 1 is not necessarily the number of risk genes found in both autism and 
cancer, but the shared functions of genes in chromatin remodeling and genome maintenance, 
transcription factors, and signal transduction pathways leading to nuclear changes [7,8]. 
Chromatin remodeling factors important in altering nucleosome accessibility for 
transcription and genome maintenance mechanisms include CHD8, CHD7, CHD2, ARID1B, 
and ATRX. ATRX may exert a more specific function in telomere maintenance, analogous to 
other Swi2/Snf2 family factors such as ERCC6, RAD54, HTLF, SHPRH, or RAD16, which 
function in dedicated DNA repair pathways. Proteins involved in histone methyltransferase 
reactions important in setting the histone code include ASHL1, EHMT1, EHMT2, KMT2C, 
KMT2D, and SUV420H1. PHF2, KDM5B, and KDM6B are histone demethylases, and 
MACROD2 encodes a nuclear factor regulated by a metabolite of histone deacetylation. 
Ubiquitin modifications to histones and other proteins are implicated by the risk genes 
CUL3, HERC2, MIB1, TBL1XR1, TRIP12, UBE3A, and WAC. Transcription factors 
genetically implicated in both autism and cancer include ADNP, PAX5, FOXP1, TCF7L2, 
and TBLXR1. Interestingly, these nuclear factors are downstream of several key signal 
transduction pathways also genetically implicated in ASD and cancer, including PTEN [7]. 
PTEN functions in the AKT signaling pathway, where its phosphatase activity is needed for 
AKT downregulation. Nuclear PTEN also regulates recombinational DNA repair, a key 
genome maintenance pathway (see below). It is unclear whether this is related to its 
signaling function or a consequence of a second independent PTEN activity, but this dual 
function may provide the rationale for the dominant role of PTEN in cancer and autism. 
Other genes encoding common tumor signaling pathways include MET (mitogen inducible 
gene 8), PTK7, and HRAS, while p53, AKT, mTOR, WNT, NOTCH, and MAPK are 
components of signaling pathways regulating the nuclear factors described above.
Autism is comorbid with several monogenic neurodevelopmental disorders including Fragile 
X (FMR1), Rett syndrome (MECP2), Phelan-McDermid (SHANK3), 15q duplication 
syndrome (UBE3A), neurofibromatosis (NF1), Tuberous sclerosis (TSC1, TSC2) and 
Cornelia de Lange syndrome (NIPBL, SMC1A) (Table 1). Neurofibromatosis and tuberous 
sclerosis are directly associated with tumors, but such tumors are benign and rarely if at all 
associated with malignancies. However, mutations in NF1, TSC1 or TSC2 do enhance the 
risk for developing cancer [6]. Notably, NF1, TSC1 and TSC2 function like PTEN in the 
AKT pathway of mTOR control. Mutations in transcriptional factor genes also mediate 
downstream signaling pathways which include key proteins implicated in cell proliferation 
or differentiation pathways implicated in cancer and autism, such as mTOR, RAS GTPases, 
MAP kinases, AKT, EIF4E, WNT, ERK, PI3K, CHD8. A risk gene originally identified in 
individuals with cancer may present as a de novo mutation in a small number of individuals 
with ASD, or may be implicated in ASD through interactome analysis of interrelated genes 
and interacting proteins, e.g. within a signaling pathway (Table 1).

 What does tumor cell proliferation have in common with brain development and neuronal 
synapse formation? Like cancers, “autisms” are best conceptualized in the plural. ASD 
encompasses a broad range of putative causes, symptom presentations, and outcomes, 
including both macrocephaly and microcephaly, suggesting deficits in the cellular 
commitment to proliferation versus differentiation, similar to cancer. This difference may be 
in the life stage of cellular proliferation. Errors associated with genome maintenance during 
fetal life may occur at critical time periods for proliferation of neuronal precursors that 
affect prenatal brain development, resulting in neurodevelopmental disorders, whereas errors 
more commonly occur during adult life in cell types susceptible to tumors. Biological 
mechanisms with potential commonalities between genes implicated in both cancers and 
autisms may be revealed from a closer investigation of the specific actions of genes and 
converging pathways identified in both [8]. For example, UBE3A, which is duplicated in 
~1–2% of ASD, encodes the ubiquitin E3 ligase protein E6-AP, first named as an E6 
interacting protein that degrades p53 in human cervical cancer [10].
The intersection between autism and cancer in genome maintenance pathways is novel and 
particularly compelling. A large cohort of autism and cancer genes affect genome 
maintenance including signaling molecules (PTEN), DNA repair factors (ERCC6, 
SMARCA2), structural chromosome components such as cohesins (NIPBL, SMC1A, SMC2), 
factors needed for Alternative Lengthening of Telomeres (ATRX), and post-translational 
modifiers (TRIP12, UBE3A, HERC2). The functional overlap goes beyond this common 
gene set, as genomes from individuals with ASD show mutational hotspots and a high 
incidence of copy number variations. These genetic events signal pathological outcomes of 
DNA replication stress. Many neuron-specific genes are rather large with primary transcripts 
in the Mbp range. Such genes are at particular risk for transcription-DNA replication 
conflicts that underpin a significant amount of genome instability [11]. While these genes 
are typically transcribed only in terminally differentiated cells, any miscoordination of 
transcriptional control, DNA replication, differentiation, and cell cycle phasing will greatly 
increase the risk of mutations targeted to these genes encoding critical brain functions. 
Transcription-coupled repair, the pathway defined by ERCC6, is of particular importance for 
terminally differentiated cells and long transcription units. Overall too little is known about 
DNA repair in terminally differentiated cells and more studies are needed to evaluate other 
pathways such as recombinational DNA repair in differentiated cells and somatic genomic 
instability in neurons. Thus, similar to cancer, the inherited risk for autism may be 
compounded by further somatic mutations associated with mutations in known risk genes 
that may be biased for genes with neuronal functions.
The functional overlap of genes and pathways between autism and cancer would suggest 
that individuals with autism may carry a higher cancer risk. While there is some 
epidemiological evidence of higher cancer risk in children, adolescents, and young adults 
with ASD [9, 12], the absolute number of cases is low and more studies need to be 
conducted, particularly in adults, as cancer incidence is significantly correlated with age.
Mouse models with mutations in many of these genes have been widely used in both cancer 
and autism research. Some of these mutant mouse models recapitulate behavioral and 
biological features of autism [13]. These model systems are proving useful in understanding

 the consequences of specific mutations on overgrowth of brain regions, unusual patterns of 
white matter connectivity, aberrant numbers of synapses, and altered morphology of 
dendritic spines, in parallel to understanding cell proliferation, cell cycle, DNA repair, and 
epigenetic causes in malignancies.
Considerable translational value can be gained from a new focus to understand the genetic 
commonalities of autism(s) and cancer(s). Importantly, mechanistic similarities can be 
leveraged into therapeutic strategies. It may be possible to repurpose available cancer drugs 
with reasonable safety profiles as targeted treatments for ASD. For example, evaluation of a 
rapamycin analogue in tuberous sclerosis patients included outcome measures for ASD 
features, along with seizures, sleep disturbances and academic skills (NCT01289912, 
ClinicalTrials.gov). Stratifying individuals with ASD who harbor a risk gene for autism that 
is also a risk gene for cancer may enable therapeutic development of personalized medicines 
based on the specific causal mutation.
