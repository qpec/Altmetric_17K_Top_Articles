Abstract
Purpose: Poor body composition metrics (BCM) are associated
with inferior cancer outcomes; however, in early breast cancer
(EBC), there is a paucity of evidence regarding the impact of BCM
on toxicities. This study investigates associations between BCM
and treatment-related toxicity in patients with EBC receiving
anthracyclines and taxane–based chemotherapy.
Experimental Design: Pretreatment computerized tomograph-
ic (CT) images were evaluated for skeletal muscle area (SMA),
skeletal muscle density (SMD), and fat tissue at the third lumbar
vertebrae. Skeletal muscle index (SMI ¼ SMA/height2) and skel-
etal muscle gauge (SMG ¼ SMI � SMD) were also calculated.
Relative risks (RR) are reported for associations between body
composition measures and toxicity outcomes, after adjustment
for age and body surface area (BSA).
Results: BCM were calculated for 151 patients with EBC
(median age, 49 years; range, 23–75 years). Fifty patients
(33%) developed grade 3/4 toxicity, which was significantly
higher in those with low SMI (RR, 1.29; P ¼ 0.002), low SMG
(RR, 1.09; P ¼ 0.01), and low lean body mass (RR, 1.48; P ¼
0.002). Receiver operating characteristic analysis showed the
SMG measure to be the best predictor of grade 3/4 toxicity.
Dividing SMG into tertiles showed toxicity rates of 46% and
22% for lowest versus highest tertile, respectively (P ¼ 0.005).
After adjusting for age and BSA, low SMG (<1,475 units) was
significantly associated with hematologic (RR, 2.12; P ¼ 0.02),
gastrointestinal grade 3/4 toxicities (RR, 6.49; P ¼ 0.02), and
hospitalizations (RR, 1.91; P ¼ 0.05).
Conclusions: Poor BCMs are significantly associated with
increased treatment-related toxicities. Further studies are needed
to investigate how these metrics can be used to more precisely
dose chemotherapy to reduce treatment-related toxicity while
maintaining efficacy. Clin Cancer Res; 23(14); 3537–43. �2017 AACR.
Introduction
Breast cancer is the most common cancer diagnosis and the
leading cause of cancer death among females worldwide (1).
In the United States in 2016, there will be an estimated
246,660 new cases of breast cancer (2). The overall survival
from breast cancer in the United States is 89.5% for all stages
(3). The treatment of early-stage breast cancer (stage I–III)
consists primarily of local therapy including surgery, with or
without radiation, and systematic therapy such as endocrine,
biologic treatment (i.e., trastuzumab), and/or chemotherapy.
Chemotherapy is an essential component of treatment for
early breast cancer (EBC), especially in hormone receptor
(HR)-positive large/node-positive tumors, or HER2-positive
and HR/HER2-negative tumors ("triple-negative"). Chemo-
therapy toxicity is a major issue. Among patients with EBC
who undergo chemotherapy, up to 20% can experience non-
hematologic and 39% experience hematologic toxicity (4). Of
note, hospitalization due to toxicity is common with adjuvant
chemotherapy and ranges from 6% to 24% in the adjuvant
setting (5). Toxicity prediction in individual patients remains a
major challenge in breast cancer care (6). However, with the
established
use
of
granulocyte
colony-stimulating
factor
(G-CSF and related agents), the incidence of neutropenia has
decreased substantially (7).
Sarcopenia (age-related muscle loss), myopenia (low muscle
mass regardless of age; ref. 8), and other body composition
measures have received increased attention as a focus of
research in oncology using widely available computed tomo-
graphic (CT) imaging (9). Sarcopenia is a common finding in
patients with cancer. In a recent meta-analysis, 19% to 74% of
patients with solid tumors were found to be sarcopenic, and the
presence of sarcopenia was correlated with poor overall survival
(HR, 1.44; P < 0.001) in both metastatic and non-metastatic
cohorts (9). However, in breast cancer, there is a paucity of data
on the potential effect of sarcopenia and other body compo-
sition measures on treatment-related toxicities. Wong and
colleagues examined the association between body composi-
tion and toxicity of anthracyclines and docetaxel used without
growth factors in Asian patients with EBC (n ¼ 84) and found
that increased visceral fat significantly correlated with grade 4

 leukopenia (P ¼ 0.014) and that low muscle volume trended
(n ¼ 15, P ¼ 0.051) toward an association with grade 3/4
leukopenia and neutropenia (10). Skeletal muscle density
(SMD) can also be obtained from routine CT imaging by
indirectly measuring intramuscular lipid content. Low SMD as
measured by mean Hounsfield units (HU), known as myos-
teatosis, indicates poor muscle "quality" and has been associ-
ated with impaired survival (11, 12). Sarcopenic obesity is
another marker for worse outcomes in patients with cancer
(12). While dosing is usually based on weight and height
measures [body surface area (BSA)], there is evidence that
pharmacokinetics and drug toxicities are more related to lean
body mass (LBM), but to date, muscle measures have not been
incorporated into routine chemotherapy dosing (13–16). As
both muscle quantity [skeletal muscle index (SMI)] and quality
(SMD) are significantly and independently associated with
cancer outcomes, testing a mathematical combination of both
has been proposed. Weinberg and colleagues were the first to
generate the skeletal muscle gauge (SMG) by multiplying SMI
times SMD as an alternative measure that showed higher
correlation with aging than either SMD or SMI alone (17) and
we have used this metric as part of our current analysis.
These findings raise the need and provide an opportunity to
investigate the association between body composition measures,
including the novel SMG in a large sample of patients with breast
cancer focusing on adverse treatment-related toxicities. The aim of
this study was to investigate whether body composition metrics in
patients with EBC are independent predictors of: (i) chemother-
apy toxicity, (ii) hospitalizations, and/or (iii) dose delays/
reductions.
Materials and Methods
Participants
Eligible patients were treated at the North Carolina Cancer
Hospital (NCCH) and identified through a review of patients in
the North Carolina tumor registry in years 2008–2013. To be
eligible for this study, patients needed to be females older than
21 years receiving neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy
treatment for EBC (stage I–III) at NCCH. Only doxorubicin–
cyclophosphamide (AC) taxane–based chemotherapy regimens
for EBC were included as most of them had pretreatment
staging CT scan. Patients also had to have a CT scan of the
abdomen dating no more than 12 weeks prior to chemotherapy
initiation. All data were extracted from electronic medical
records at NCCH. The Institutional Review Board at the Uni-
versity of North Carolina (UNC) at Chapel Hill approved the
study and there was no direct contact with patients.
Toxicity grading
Toxicity grades 3–5 according to National Cancer Institute
Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE; Ver-
sion 4.03; ref. 18) were extracted during and after the chemo-
therapy course through retrospective medical chart review. We
examined hematologic toxicity (neutropenia, thrombocytopenia,
anemia), febrile neutropenia, and common non-hematologic
toxicities such as neurotoxicity and gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity
(stomatitis, diarrhea, vomiting). Data on other toxicities—
congestive heart failure (CHF), deep vein thrombosis (DVT),
pulmonary emboli (PE), and leukemia—were also gathered from
the medical record. Dose reductions (any dose reduction by the
treating physician), treatment delays (any delay based on a
toxicity event), and hospitalizations due to chemotherapy toxicity
were also collected.
CT-based body composition analysis
Abdominal CT images were acquired from the UNC Picture
Archiving and Communication System (PACS) office. Measur-
ing muscle metrics at L3 level is the most commonly used
technique utilizing CT scans and validated as highly correlated
to total body muscle mass (r2 ¼ 0.86; ref. 19). CT images were
examined using AGFA-Impax (version 6) radiological software,
and transverse sections at the L3 level were extracted for
external analysis. L3 lumbar segments were processed using
the "Automated Body Composition Analyzer using Computed
tomography image Segmentation" (ABACS) software (20, 21).
The software recognizes muscle tissue based on a density
threshold between �29 and þ150 HU while using a priori
information about the L3 muscle shape to avoid mislabeling
parts of the neighboring organs that have HU values in the
(�29 to þ150) range as muscle tissue. The program provides
a highly accurate (22) and unbiased estimation of the cross-
sectional lean tissue area and skeletal muscle area (SMA; Fig. 1).
SMI was calculated using the following formula: (SMA, cm2)/
(patient height, m2). Estimated LBM was calculated using the
following formula: LBM (kg) ¼ 0.30 � [skeletal muscle at L3
using CT (cm2)] þ 6.06 (14). Mean SMD was derived by
averaging HU of skeletal muscle. To integrate both the SMI
and the SMD, SMG was calculated by multiplying SMI and
SMD. The actual units for SMG are (cm2 tissue � average HU)/
(m2, height), and for simplicity, we present them as arbitrary
units (AU). Subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) area was cal-
culated from extramuscular tissue with density between �190
and �30 HU and visceral adipose tissue (VAT) from non-
subcutaneous tissue with density between �150 and �50 HU.
An investigator (M. Weinberg) was trained by a radiologist to
obtain the images and a radiologist reviewed the images for
quality assurance. The imaging results were masked from the
investigator obtaining toxicity data.
Translational Relevance
Currently, chemotherapy dosing is commonly based on the
body surface area (BSA) formula, which accounts for height
and weight only but not for other potentially important body
composition indices. This article presents the largest study to
date assessing the impact of several body composition mea-
sures on chemotherapy toxicity in patients with early breast
cancer receiving adjuvant chemotherapy. Our results show
that skeletal muscle gauge (SMG), a new and innovative metric
derived from the combination of muscle mass (quantity) and
radiodensity (quality), is the best predictor of chemotherapy
adverse outcomes including grade 3/4 chemotherapy toxici-
ties, hospitalizations, and other adverse events. Receiver oper-
ating characteristic curves show that SMG is a better predictor
of chemotherapy toxicity than either lean body mass or BSA.
Our results suggest that body composition measurements
obtained from routine computed tomographic (CT) images
performed for staging might be used to individualize chemo-
therapy dosing and potentially improve its therapeutic index.

 Patient and clinical characteristics
In addition to toxicity data, we also collected age at diagnosis,
HR and HER2 subtypes, stage at diagnosis, timing of chemother-
apy (neoadjuvant/adjuvant), whether a biologic agent was used
with chemotherapy, the type of taxane chemotherapy, height, and
weight. BSA (m2) was calculated as

mass index (BMI) was calculated as weight (kg)/height2 (m2). We
defined sarcopenic obesity as a patient with a BMI � 30.0 kg/m2
and an SMI � 41 cm2/m2 (12).
Statistical analysis
Relative risks (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) are
reported for associations between body composition measures
and toxicity outcomes. Both unadjusted and adjusted RRs were
calculated using Poisson regression models with robust variance
(23). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were gener-
ated, as well as the area under the curve (AUC), to evaluate the
predictive ability of each body composition measure. Using the
Youden index, the point which maximizes both the sensitivity and
specificity was determined to be the best cutoff point for SMG. All
analyses were conducted using SAS v9.4 statistical software.
Results
Study population
Patient characteristics are summarized in Supplementary Table
S1 (selection process is shown in Supplementary Fig. S1). A total
of 151 patients were identified who received adjuvant or neoad-
juvant AC taxane chemotherapy (dosing and scheduling in Sup-
plementary Table S2) were treated at NCCH. Mean age was 49
years (range, 23–75 years) and 74% were white. The mean time
from CT scan to chemotherapy initiation was 23 days (SD, 19). All
patients with HER2-positive tumors received concomitant anti-
HER2 treatment during chemotherapy. No patients had grade 5
toxicity recorded (death).
Body composition as a predictor of any grade 3/4 toxicity
Fifty patients (33%) developed grade 3/4 toxicity during
chemotherapy treatment, and these toxicities were associated
with poorer body composition. The relationship of toxicity and
body composition by tertile is presented in Fig. 2. Unadjusted
RRs for each body composition measure are shown in Table 1.
For every 5-kg decrease in LBM, the risk of any toxicity increased
by 36% [RR ¼ 1.36 (1.12–1.66), P ¼ 0.002]. For every 5-unit
decrease in SMI, the risk of any toxicity increased by 27% [RR ¼
1.27 (1.09–1.49), P ¼ 0.002]. For every 100-AU decrease in
SMG, the risk of any toxicity increased by 8% [RR ¼ 1.08 (1.02–
1.15), P ¼ 0.006]. While not statistically significant, the risk
of any toxicity also increased for every 5-unit decrease in SMD
[RR ¼ 1.11 (0.98–1.25), P ¼ 0.08]. BMI, BSA, SAT/VAT area,
and SAT/VAT density were not associated with any grade 3/4
toxicity. Significant associations observed in the unadjusted
analysis remained statistically significant after adjustment
for age and BSA (Table 2). Similarly, after adjusting for race
and the use of G-CSF, SMG associations with toxicity risk
remained significant.
In Supplementary Fig. S2, ROC curves along with AUC
statistics are shown for each measure based on the outcome
of "any toxicity." BMI and BSA show poor discrimination (AUC
� 0.5), whereas other measures demonstrate better discrimi-
nation, with SMG being the best (AUC ¼ 0.65). Using the
Youden index, we identified an SMG cutoff point of 1475. Fig-
ure 3 illustrates the proportion of patients above and below this
cutoff point for different toxicities and demonstrates that
patients with an SMG below the cutoff point had more hema-
tologic and GI grade 3/4 toxicities as well as hospitalizations.
Patients with low SMG (<1,475 AU) were about twice as likely
to experience any toxicity compared with patients with high
SMG [�1,475 AU; RR ¼ 2.15 (1.36–3.40), P ¼ 0.001].
Although there were only 5 patients with sarcopenic obesity
in our sample (of them, 4 received G-CSF), all grade 3/4
hematologic toxicities [RR ¼ 3.02 (1.38–6.63), P ¼ 0.006],
dose reductions or delays [RR ¼ 2.65 (1.61–4.39), P < 0.001],
and neutropenia [RR ¼ 3.5 (1.57–7.8), P ¼ 0.002] were
significantly more likely to occur in these patients.
We additionally performed a sensitivity analysis of patients
that received paclitaxel only (n ¼ 142) and found that after
generating SMG cutoff point based on this population, SMG
remained a significant predictor of grade 3/4 toxicity (RR ¼

GI toxicities (RR ¼ 12.17), and hospitalizations (RR ¼ 2.10).
Body composition as a predictor of grade 3/4 hematologic
toxicity
Hematologic toxicities were reported in 35 patients (23%),
including neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia (see
Supplementary Table S1). Low SMG was significantly asso-
ciated with a higher risk of hematologic toxicity—twice as
high among the patients with SMG < 1,475 as compared with
the patients with SMG � 1,475 [RR ¼ 2.00 (1.08–3.72), P ¼
0.03]. After adjusting for age and BSA, the high risk for
hematologic toxicities in the low SMG group remained statis-
tically significant.
Body composition as a predictor of grade 3/4 GI toxicity and
neuropathy
Seven patients (5%) had grade 3/4 GI toxicity and 11 (7%) had
grade 3/4 neuropathy (see Tables 1 and 2). In unadjusted anal-
yses, SMG was the only body composition measure significantly
associated with GI toxicity. For every 100-unit decrease in SMG,
the risk of GI toxicity increased by 28% [RR ¼ 1.28 (1.08–1.51),
P ¼ 0.004]. However, after adjustment for age and BSA, lower
LBM, SMI, SMD, and SMG were significantly associated with an

 increased risk for GI toxicity. In unadjusted analyses, SMG was the
only body composition measure significantly associated with
grade 3/4 neuropathy. For every 100-unit decrease in SMG, the
risk of neuropathy increased by 15% [RR ¼ 1.15 (1.00–1.31), P ¼
0.04]. However after adjusting for age and BSA, the association
between SMG and neuropathy was no longer statistically
significant.
Body composition as a predictor of hospitalizations
Thirty patients (20.7%) of 145 patients with full hospitali-
zation records were hospitalized for treatment-related toxicity.
For every 5-unit decrease in SMD, the risk of hospitalization
increased by 19% [RR ¼ 1.19 (1.00–1.43), P ¼ 0.05]. After
adjustment for age and BSA, SMD remained a significant
predictor, and patients with SMG < 1,475 as compared with
the patients with SMG � 1,475 had twice the hospitalization
risk [RR ¼ 1.91 (1.00–3.66), P ¼ 0.05]. All other body com-
position measures were unrelated to hospitalization in both
unadjusted and adjusted models.
Discussion
This is the first study, to our knowledge, to evaluate the
relationship of LBM, SMG, and other body composition measures
with treatment toxicity in a large sample of patients with EBC
receiving the commonly used chemotherapy regimens of an
anthracycline and taxane. After adjusting for age and BSA, lower
LBM was significantly associated with having any grade 3/4
toxicity as well as grade 3/4 GI toxicity. SMG, a novel integrated
measure of body composition, was significantly associated with
having any grade 3/4 toxicity as well as grade 3/4 GI toxicities,
hematologic toxicities, and hospitalizations. As illustrated by the
large number of body composition measures analyzed in this
study, body composition is extremely variable. However, mea-
sures that include muscle metrics are clearly related to the toxicity,
whereas adipose metrics (VAT and SAT) are not. In addition, the
small number of patients with sarcopenic obesity had significant-
ly more dose adjustments and hematologic toxicities compared
with patients who were not both sarcopenic and obese. Of note,
aging is associated with decreasing muscle mass and lower muscle
density, and age-related changes are more correlated with SMG
than either SMI or SMD alone (17).
Our findings are supported by other studies. Prado and col-
leagues in a small (n ¼ 24) but novel study found that higher
toxicity was associated with lower LBM in patients with EBC
receiving epirubicin containing adjuvant therapy (56.2 vs. 41.6
kg, P ¼ 0.002). In that study, LBM was also an independent and
significant predictor of epirubicin pharmacokinetics (PK) and

 toxicity (15). Tamandl and colleagues observed that low SMD was
associated with poorer survival in patients with gastric cancer (HR,
1.91; 95 % CI, 1.12–3.28; P ¼ 0.019; ref. 11). Others have also
found an association of body composition with toxicity and
survival in early cancer (13, 15, 24).
A unique aspect of our study is the use of a new metric—
SMG—that takes into account both muscle quantity (SMI) and
quality (SMD). Of all the metrics, SMG was the single most
predictive of toxicity. On the basis of ROC analyses for any
grade 3/4 toxicity, we determined the best cutoff point for SMG
to be 1,475. Using this cutoff point, we found that low SMG
was associated with grade 3/4 GI toxicity and grade 3/4 hema-
tologic toxicity and hospitalizations after adjusting age and BSA
(Fig. 3). Furthermore, after adjusting for G-CSF usage and race,
this SMG cutoff point remained significant. This cutoff point
might be helpful in identifying patients at high risk for toxicity
and should be explored in future trials. Moreover, we have
previously shown that low SMG in an older cancer population
is correlated with lower physical function and increased frailty
(22, 23), both of which are associated with poorer cancer
outcomes and shortened survival (25).
Our study has some limitations. First, our cohort included
only a small sample of older patients (>65 years; n ¼ 9). Older
patients comprise a large portion of the breast cancer popu-
lation and age is associated with decreased muscle mass and
muscle density. Second, many patients now receive non–
anthracycline-containing chemotherapy and future work will
be needed to explore the role of muscle metrics and body
composition for these chemotherapy regimens. This may be
challenging, as many patients treated with non-anthracycline
regimens present with stage I or II breast cancer where baseline
CT scans are not recommended (26). Third, performance status
(PS) was recorded only for 78 patients in our sample, all of
whom had excellent scores of 0 or 1 (ECOG) and comorbid-
ities were not consistently reported in the medical chart.
However, PS scores of 0 or 1 are typical of patients in clinical
trials, as well as those who are treated with more toxic anthra-
cycline and taxane–based chemotherapy regimens. Further-
more, the clinical decision to use chemotherapy was made by
the physician with patient input, and we assumed that comor-
bidities were taken into account when recommending the
treatment plan. Another potential limitation is the use of
different taxane regimens, but a sensitivity analysis of the
142 patients who received paclitaxel only showed that SMG
remained a significant predictor of grade 3/4 hematologic
toxicities, GI toxicities, and hospitalizations. The final limita-
tion is the use of retrospective data in assessing toxicity out-
comes; for this reason, we chose to collect only grade 3/4
toxicities which are medically meaningful and usually docu-
mented in the patient chart (27).
Despite major limitations in its accuracy at predicting treat-
ment efficacy and toxicity, BSA has traditionally been used in
oncology to dose chemotherapy (28, 29). After controlling for
BSA, we showed that LBM and SMG were still highly effective
predictors of grade 3/4 toxicities. On the basis of ROC anal-
yses, we found that LBM and SMG were the best predictors of
severe chemotherapy toxicity (see Supplementary Fig. S2). BSA
dosing based only on weight and height ignores whether the
weight is related to increased adipose tissue or to LBM, which
is problematic in light of the low correlation between LBM and
BSA (30). In patients with increased adiposity and low LBM in
our study, standard BSA-based dosing was associated with high
toxicity rates (see Fig. 1 for an example). There is growing
evidence to support our conclusion that LBM is better at
predicting treatment toxicity than BSA for both anthracyclines
and 5-fluorouracil (13, 15).
Our results add to the increasing body of research showing that
chemotherapy toxicity is clearly associated with body composi-
tion. Moreover, we have defined the importance of body com-
position in predicting toxicity for patients with EBC, one of the
most common cancers worldwide, and for chemotherapy regi-
mens that are widely used. Our results demonstrate that the
importance of LBM and body composition in patients with cancer
highlights the need for specific interventions to improve unfa-
vorable body composition and to potentially decrease treatment-
related toxicity. Several treatments for sarcopenia of potential
benefit include anamerolin (31), exercise (32, 33), and omega-3
fatty acid dietary supplementation (34). The generation of indi-
vidualized body composition measures from readily available CT
scans holds great promise in individualizing and improving
chemotherapy outcomes and validation of these measures in
prospective trials is urgently needed. Such trials should compare
body composition measures with both toxicity and efficacy out-
comes and should ideally include PK measures of the chemo-
therapeutic or biologic agents.
