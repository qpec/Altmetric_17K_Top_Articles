Background: Lack of agreement about criteria and terminology for children’s language problems affects access to
services as well as hindering research and practice. We report the second phase of a study using an online Delphi
method to address these issues. In the first phase, we focused on criteria for language disorder. Here we consider
terminology. Methods: The Delphi method is an iterative process in which an initial set of statements is rated by a
panel of experts, who then have the opportunity to view anonymised ratings from other panel members. On this basis
they can either revise their views or make a case for their position. The statements are then revised based on panel
feedback, and again rated by and commented on by the panel. In this study, feedback from a second round was used
to prepare a final set of statements in narrative form. The panel included 57 individuals representing a range of
professions and nationalities. Results: We achieved at least 78% agreement for 19 of 21 statements within two
rounds of ratings. These were collapsed into 12 statements for the final consensus reported here. The term ‘Language
Disorder’ is recommended to refer to a profile of difficulties that causes functional impairment in everyday life and is
associated with poor prognosis. The term, ‘Developmental Language Disorder’ (DLD) was endorsed for use when the
language disorder was not associated with a known biomedical aetiology. It was also agreed that (a) presence of risk
factors (neurobiological or environmental) does not preclude a diagnosis of DLD, (b) DLD can co-occur with other
neurodevelopmental disorders (e.g. ADHD) and (c) DLD does not require a mismatch between verbal and nonverbal
ability. Conclusions: This Delphi exercise highlights reasons for disagreements about terminology for language
disorders and proposes standard definitions and nomenclature. Keywords: Developmental language disorder;
specific language impairment; terminology; risk factors; definitions.
Introduction
Language problems are common in children, with
prevalence estimates ranging from 3% to 7%, depend-
ing on age and definition (Norbury et al., 2016;
Tomblin, Records et al., 1997; Weindrich, Jennen-
Steinmetz, Laucht, Esser, & Schmidt, 2000). In
relation to their severity and prevalence, children’s
language problems receive considerably less research
funding than other conditions such as attention
deficit
hyperactivity
disorder
(ADHD)
or
autism
spectrum disorder (ASD), with which they frequently
co-occur (Bishop, 2010). The term Specific Language
Impairment (SLI) has been widely used to refer to
children whose language development is not following
the usual course despite typical development in other
areas. However, professionals and lay people alike
appear to be far less familiar with SLI compared with
dyslexia or autism (Kamhi, 2004). Of more concern,
Ebbels (2014) described how use of the term SLI had
become controversial, because it seemed not to reflect
clinical realities and excluded many children from
services.
Bishop, Snowling, Thompson, Greenhalgh and
The CATALISE Consortium (2016) used an online
version of the Delphi technique (Hasson, Keeney, &
McKenna, 2000) with the aim of achieving consensus
on these issues. Because of the complexity of the
subject matter, we divided the task into two phases:
the first, described by Bishop et al. (2016) focused
on criteria for identifying significant language prob-
lems in children. Here we describe the second phase,
where the same panel focused on the issue of
terminology for children’s language problems. Here
we describe this second phase.
Materials and methods
Ethics approval
This research was approved by The Medical Sciences Interdis-
ciplinary Research Ethics Committee, University of Oxford
(approval number: MS-IDREC-C1-2015-061). Panel members
gave written consent for their ratings to be used to derive a
consensus statement.
Delphi panel
We approached the same panel members who had formed part
of the CATALISE consortium for our previous Delphi on
criteria. As detailed by Bishop et al. (2016), we restricted
consideration to English-speaking countries, and there was a
predominance
of
speech-language
therapists/pathologists
(SLT/Ps). Of the original panel, two declined to take part in

 CATALISE-2 for personal reasons, leaving a panel of 57
individuals, whose characteristics are shown in Table 1. Nine
panel members had a close relative with impaired language
development.
The first two authors (DVMB and MJS), both psychologists
with considerable experience in the area of children’s language
problems, acted as moderators: they did not contribute rank-
ings, but agreed on modifications to statements on the basis of
feedback from the panel. The third author (PT) set up the
online Delphi, controlled the anonymisation and analysed
responses to produce reports for panel members. The fourth
(TG), an expert in primary health care who was familiar with
the Delphi method acted, as methodological advisor.
Delphi consensus process
We started with a set of statements about terminology accom-
panied by a background document (Appendix S1) that put
these in context. These were new statements that were
different from those in the prior Delphi exercise on criteria,
though they were informed by issues that arose in that study
(Bishop et al., 2016). Panel members were asked to rate the
statements on a 5-point scale from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5
(strongly agree).
Participant responses to Round 1 were collated. The distri-
bution of responses and associated anonymised comments
were then fed back to all panel members and scrutinised by the
moderators. One difference from our previous Delphi was that
we held a 1-day meeting to present and discuss preliminary
results from CATALISE-2 before proceeding to Round 2. All
panel members were invited to this, as well as additional
stakeholders. The meeting was attended by the first four
authors and 22 of the CATALISE-2 consortium, as well as 23
individuals representing a range of fields: eight from speech
and language therapy, eight from psychology, one paediatri-
cian, two representatives from charities, one expert in special
educational needs, one geneticist, one general practitioner and
one psychiatrist.
On the basis of ratings, qualitative comments and discus-
sions at the meeting, the two moderators agreed on rewording
of some items and revision of the background document. The
set of items and background document used in Round 2 are
shown in Appendix S2.
There is no agreed criterion for when a Delphi consensus is
deemed adequate for an item – in the literature, values from
51% to 80% agreement have been used (Hasson et al., 2000).
We aimed for 75% agreement as a reasonable goal.
After Round 2, the moderators made some further revisions
to the statements to improve clarity and readability, to take
into account specific comments provided by the panel, and to
reconsider the two problematic items. Some statements with
good agreement were consolidated to give a single longer
statement (see Appendix S3), giving a total of 13 statements. A
draft of the current paper, including finalised statements in the
Results section, was circulated for comments and approval by
the panel. Further revisions were made to address points
raised by reviewers, including the dropping of one redundant
statement, and the paper was again circulated to all panel
members for comment. The current paper represents the final
agreed version.
Results and discussion
Round 1
The response rate by panel members for Round 1
was 93%. Appendix S4 shows quantitative and
qualitative responses to the Round 1 statements; a
personalised copy of this report containing these
data was sent to all panel members, showing how
their own responses related to the distribution of
responses from other (anonymised) panel members.
The percentage agreement (combining strongly agree
with agree) ranged from 30% to 98% for the 16 items,
with a median value of 74%.
Kruskal–Wallis tests were conducted on each
item to test whether agreement was related to
either geographical location (six countries) or pro-
fessional status (SLT/P vs. others), using a Bonfer-
roni-corrected
p-value
of
.001.
None
of
these
comparisons was statistically significant after cor-
rection for multiple comparisons. Given the small
sample size, we cannot rule out an effect of these
two factors on ratings, but the analysis offers some
reassurance that responses did not simply pattern
according to professional background or geograph-
ical location.
Round 2
The response rate by panel members for Round 2
was 91%. Appendix S5 contains the data that were
incorporated in a personalised report sent to all
panel members for Round 2. The percentage agree-
ment (combining ratings of strongly agree with
agree) ranged from 46% to 98% across items, with
a median value of 90%. Of the 21 items, 19 had
agreement of 78% or more, which we regarded as
adequate to accept that statement. Items 19 and
20, both concerned with terms for subtypes of
language disorder, had 68% and 46% agreement
respectively, indicating a need for further revision
or omission.

Delphi consensus on terminology for language problems
1069
 Statement 1.
It is important that those working in
the field of children’s language problems use consis-
tent terminology.
Supplementary comment.
In Round 2, a version of
this statement was included to orient the panel to
our common goal. Although the terminology we
propose is not novel, its adoption will require many
people to change their practices, which will be
difficult where there is a long-standing preference
for other terms. Nevertheless, panel members were
strongly motivated to achieve a consensus, because
the lack of consistency was recognised as a major
problem for the field.
Statement 2.
The term ‘language disorder’ is
proposed for children who are likely to have language
problems
enduring
into
middle
childhood
and
beyond, with a significant impact on everyday social
interactions or educational progress.
Supplementary comment.
This statement clarifies
that prognosis should be a key factor in the defini-
tion of language disorder; that is, the term should
include those with language problems that lead to
significant
functional
impairments
unlikely
to
resolve without specialist help. There is no sharp
dividing line between language disorder and typical
development, but we can use relevant information
from longitudinal studies to help determine progno-
sis (see Statement 3).
Arguments for preferring the term ‘disorder’ to
‘impairment’ included the greater seriousness and
importance associated with the term; consistency
with other neurodevelopmental disorders (autism
spectrum disorder, developmental coordination dis-
order, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder); and
compatibility with the two main diagnostic systems,
DSM-5 (American Psychiatric Association, 2013) and
ICD-11 (Baird, personal communication).
Some panel members expressed concerns that the
term
‘disorder’
had
medical
connotations
and
placed the problem ‘inside the child’, when it might
be contextually dependent. It was thought to have
negative associations for teachers and there were
concerns
that
such
a
label
could
lead
to
low
expectations. For this reason, our definition explic-
itly excludes children who have limited language
skills because of lack of exposure to the language of
instruction,
or
are
likely
to
grow
out
of
their
problems. These children often benefit from educa-
tional interventions, and may require monitoring,
but they should not be identified as language
disordered.
Another objection to the term ‘disorder’ is that
historically it has been interpreted as referring to a
large mismatch between language and nonverbal
ability. This interpretation has been widely adopted
in some circles, but is discredited and is not part of
our definition (Bishop et al., 2016) (see also State-
ment 8).
Statement 3.
Research evidence indicates that
predictors of poor prognosis vary with a child’s age,
but in general language problems that affect a range
of skills are likely to persist.
Supplementary
comment.
Prognostic
indicators
will vary with age. Our focus here is on what we
know about learning English.
Under 3 years:
Prediction of outcome is particu-
larly hard in children under 3 years of age. Many
toddlers
who
have
limited
vocabulary
at
18–
24 months catch up, and despite much research, it
can be difficult to identify which late talkers are
likely to have long-term problems (Reilly et al.,
2010).
Children
who
fail
to
combine
words
at
24 months appear to have worse outcomes than
those who do not produce any words at 15 months,
though this is still a far from perfect predictor
(Rudolph & Leonard, 2016). Prognosis is also poorer
for children with comprehension problems, those
who do not communicate via gesture (Ellis & Thal,
2008), or do not imitate body movements (Dohmen,
Bishop, Chiat, & Roy, 2016). Roy and Chiat (2014)
administered a preschool measure of social respon-
siveness and joint attention to 2- to 4-year olds
referred for speech-language therapy, and found it
was predictive of persisting problems, and indicative
of social communication problems at 9 years. A
positive family history of language or literacy prob-
lems is an additional risk factor (Rudolph & Leonard,
2016; Zambrana, Pons, Eadie, & Ystrom, 2014).
Overall, however, the prediction from late language
emergence
to
subsequent
language
disorder
at
school age is surprisingly weak: in part because
many late talkers catch up but also because some
school-aged children with language disorder were
not late to talk (Snowling, Duff, Nash, & Hulme,
2016; Zambrana et al., 2014).
Three to four years:
Prediction improves as chil-
dren grow older; in 4-year olds, the greater the
number of areas of language functioning that is
impaired, the higher the likelihood that the problems
will persist into school age (Bishop & Edmundson,
1987). Note that this finding contradicts the idea
that intervention should be focused on children with
a ‘spiky’ language profile rather than a more even
pattern of impairment. When individual language
tests are considered, sentence repetition has been
identified as a relatively good marker for predicting
outcomes (Everitt, Hannaford, & Conti-Ramsden,
2013).
In contrast, there is generally a good prognosis for
preschoolers
whose
problems
are
restricted
to
expressive phonology (Beitchman, Wilson, Brownlie,
Walters et al., 1996; Bishop & Adams, 1990).

 Five years and over:
Language problems that are
still evident at 5 years and over are likely to persist
(Stothard, Snowling, Bishop, Chipchase, & Kaplan,
1998). Children who start school with oral language
problems are at risk of reading problems and poor
academic attainment (Bishop & Adams, 1990; Catts,
Fey, Tomblin, & Zhang, 2002; Thompson et al., 2015)
with little evidence that the language gap closes over
time (Rice & Hoffman, 2015). Prognosis appears
particularly poor when receptive language is impaired
(Beitchman, Wilson, Brownlie, Walters, & Lancee,
1996; Clark et al., 2007), and when nonverbal ability
is relatively low (Catts et al., 2002; Johnson, Beitch-
man, & Brownlie, 2010; Rice & Hoffman, 2015).
Family factors:
There has been some debate over the
predictive value of family factors. As noted above,
several studies found that a positive family history of
language problems is a predictor (albeit weak) of
persisting problems in late talkers, and family history
isalsoassociatedwithpoorliteracyoutcomes(Snowling
& Melby-Lerv�
ag, 2016). It is less clear whether social
backgroundisindependentlypredictive,onceotherrisk
factors have been taken into account (Botting, Fara-
gher, Simkin, Knox, & Conti-Ramsden, 2001).
For further discussion of the range of language
skills under consideration, see Statement 11.
Statement 4.
Some children may have language
needs because their first or home language differs
from the local language, and they have had insuffi-
cient exposure to the language used by the school or
community to be fully fluent in it. This should not be
regarded as language
disorder, unless
there is
evidence
that
the
child
does
not
have
age-
appropriate skills in any language.
Supplementary comment.
This statement makes it
clear that a low score on a language test does not
necessarily mean that a child has any kind of
disorder. It is important to consider whether the
child has adequate proficiency in any language. In
general, multilingualism does not lead to language
problems (Paradis, 2016), but where there has been
limited experience with the language used at school,
the child may require extra help (Cattani et al.,
2014). This also applies to hearing-impaired children
whose native language is a signed language. In
practice, however, for many languages, we lack
suitable (normed) assessments (Jordaan, 2008).
Statement 5.
Rather than using exclusionary cri-
teria in the definition of language disorder, we draw a
threefold distinction between differentiating condi-
tions, risk factors and co-occurring conditions.
Supplementary
comment.
Use
(and
misuse)
of
exclusionary factors in definitions of language disor-
der was a major issue leading to dissatisfaction with
terminology in this field. Panel members were con-
cerned that, instead of being used for diagnostic
differentiation, exclusionary criteria were sometimes
interpreted as criteria for denying services to children.
On the other hand, grouping together all children
with a language problem, regardless of cause, and
without regard to type of intervention required,
would, in many contexts, be counterproductive.
Statements 6–10 explain how we draw the distinc-
tion between differentiating conditions, risk factors
and co-occurring conditions.
Statement
6.
Differentiating
conditions
are
biomedical conditions in which language disorder
occurs as part of a more complex pattern of impair-
ments. This may indicate a specific intervention
pathway. We recommend referring to ‘Language
disorder associated with X’, where X is the differen-
tiating condition, as specified above.
Supplementary
comment.
Differentiating
condi-
tions include brain injury, acquired epileptic aphasia
in childhood, certain neurodegenerative conditions,
cerebral palsy and oral language limitations associated
with sensori-neural hearing loss (Tomblin et al., 2015)
as well as genetic conditions such as Down syndrome.
We also include here children with autism spectrum
disorder (ASD) and/or intellectual disability (Harris,
2013)becausetheseconditions are commonlylinkedto
genetic or neurological causes (Fitzgerald et al., 2015;
Shevell, Majnemer, Rosenbaum, & Abrahamowicz,
2001), with the numbers of known aetiology increasing
with advances in genetic methods (Bourgeron, 2015;
Fitzgerald et al., 2015; Shevell et al., 2001).
These are all cases where an association between a
biomedical condition and language disorder is com-
monly seen. In such cases, the child requires sup-
port for the language problems, but the intervention
pathway will need to take into account the distinctive
features of the biomedical condition. It should be
noted, however, that there is little research directly
comparing language intervention approaches across
conditions, so this inference is based on clinical
judgement rather than research evidence.
Statement 7.
The term Developmental Language
Disorder (DLD) is proposed to refer to cases of
language disorder with no known differentiating
condition (as defined in Statement 6). Distinguishing
these cases is important when doing research on
aetiology, and is likely also to have implications for
prognosis and intervention.
Supplementary comment.
The term ‘Developmen-
tal Language Disorder’ is consistent with ICD-11
(Baird, personal communication), though our defi-
nition does not include any nonverbal ability criteria.
‘Developmental’ in this context refers to the fact
that the condition emerges in the course of develop-
ment, rather than being acquired or associated with

Delphi consensus on terminology for language problems
1071
 a known biomedical cause. Although many panel
members endorsed it, some objections to the term
‘developmental’ were encountered. It was noted that
‘developmental’ can become less useful, or even
confusing, as individuals grow older. One proposed
solution was to drop the ‘developmental’ part of the
term in adulthood – this is how this issue is typically
handled in the case of (developmental) dyslexia,
where affected adults usually refer to themselves as
‘dyslexic’. Some panel members noted specific mean-
ings of ‘developmental’ that were not intended: for
example, that this was something that the child
might ‘grow out of’, or – quite the converse – that a
developmental problem meant that the child would
be unable to develop language. It was also suggested
that this term might be hard for parents to under-
stand – though similar objections were made for
other alternatives that were offered, namely ‘primary’
and ‘specific’ language disorder.
Statement 8.
A child with a language disorder
may have a low level of nonverbal ability. This does
not preclude a diagnosis of DLD.
Supplementary comment.
It is important to recog-
nise that language can be selectively impaired in a
child with normal nonverbal ability, but this state-
ment confirms that a large discrepancy between
nonverbal and verbal ability is not required for a
diagnosis of DLD. In practice, this means that
children with low nonverbal ability who do not meet
criteria for intellectual disability (Harris, 2013) can
be included as cases of DLD.
Statement 9.
Co-occurring disorders are impair-
ments
in
cognitive,
sensori-motor
or
behavioural
domains that can co-occur with DLD and may affect
pattern of impairment and response to intervention, but
whose causal relation to language problems is unclear.
These include attentional problems (ADHD), motor
problems
(developmental
coordination
disorder
or
DCD), reading and spelling problems (developmental
dyslexia), speech problems, limitations of adaptive
behaviour and/orbehavioural, and emotional disorders.
Supplementary comment.
The terminology used
for neurodevelopmental disorders can create the
impression that there is a set of distinct conditions,
but the reality is that many children have a mixture
of problems. Indeed, the same problems may be
labelled differently depending on the professional the
child sees. For example, the same child may be
regarded as having DLD by a SLT/P, dyslexia by a
teacher, auditory processing disorder by an audiol-
ogist, or ADHD by a paediatrician. Given our focus
on DLD, our aim with this statement was to make it
clear that presence of another neurodevelopmental
diagnosis does not preclude DLD.
Some panel members noted that a case could be
made for including ASD as a co-occurring disorder,
rather than a differentiating factor. One reason for
keeping it as a differentiating factor is that a
substantial minority of children with ASD have a
clear genetic aetiology: changes in chromosomes,
copy number variants or specific mutations are
estimated as accounting for around 25% of cases
(Bourgeron, 2015), a figure likely to increase with
advances in genetic methods. This is in contrast with
the other neurodevelopmental disorders listed here,
where, although there is evidence for heritability, the
aetiology appears to be complex and multifactorial
(see e.g. Bishop (2015) on dyslexia). In addition,
communication problems are a core diagnostic fea-
ture of ASD, albeit with wide variation in the severity
and nature of the language problems (Williams,
Botting, & Boucher, 2008). Finally, the co-occurring
social and behavioural difficulties suggest the need
for a distinctive intervention approach for ASD.
There was discussion about including auditory
processing disorder (APD) as a co-occurring condi-
tion. This category is controversial (Moore, 2006),
but this should not lead to it being ignored. Children
who are given this diagnosis often have co-occurring
language problems which require expert evaluation
(Dawes & Bishop, 2009; Sharma, Purdy, & Kelly,
2009).
Some panel members noted that relatively pure
cases without co-occurring problems might be more
common in epidemiological than in clinical samples.
However, that this may in part reflect the criteria
used to define cases in epidemiological studies, who
may not be screened for difficulties in domains
beyond language and IQ. A focus on ‘pure’ cases
has been traditional in research settings, because it
can clarify which features of a disorder are specific to
language. However, this can make it difficult to
generalise research findings to many children seen
in clinical settings, where co-occurring conditions
are more commonly observed. Most panel members
agreed that the term DLD should apply whether or
not co-occurring problems are documented.
Statement 10.
Risk factors are biological or envi-
ronmental factors that are statistically associated
with language disorder, but whose causal relation-
ship to the language problem is unclear or partial.
Risk factors do not exclude a diagnosis of DLD.
Supplementary comment.
These are factors that
are not robust predictors of individual children’s
language status or outcome, but which are more
common in children with language disorders than
typically developing children (Zubrick, Taylor, &
Christensen, 2015). A systematic review found that
commonly documented risk factors include a family
history of language disorders or dyslexia, being male,
being a younger sibling in a large family and fewer
years of parental education (Rudolph, 2016). Prena-
tal/perinatal problems do not seem to be an impor-
tant risk factor for language disorders (Tomblin,

 Smith, & Zhang, 1997; Whitehouse, Shelton, Ing, &
Newnham, 2014).
It is important to note that associated risk factors
may differ depending on the age of the child, and
whether epidemiological or clinical samples are
considered.
Statement 11.
Developmental language disorder
is a heterogeneous category that encompasses a
wide range of problems. Nevertheless, it can be
helpful for clinicians to pinpoint the principal areas
for intervention, and researchers may decide to focus
on children with specific characteristics to define
more homogeneous samples for study. We suggest
here some guidelines for more in-depth analysis of
language problems.
Supplementary comment.
The panel members did
not reach good agreement on terminology for sub-
groups, and this may reflect the fact that, although
attempts have been made to develop a classification
of subtypes, these have not in general been validated
as categories that are stable over time (Conti-
Ramsden & Botting, 1999). The traditional distinc-
tion used in DSM, between receptive and expressive
language disorder, is rather gross, and fails to
indicate which aspects of language are proving
problematic.
We
have
therefore
opted
for
an
approach that uses specifiers indicating the princi-
pal dimensions of language difficulty, with a recom-
mendation that assessment focus on identifying
which areas are most impaired. We outline these
briefly below. Note: our focus here is on oral rather
than written language, though reading and writing
are commonly affected in DLD.
Phonology:
Phonology is the branch of linguistics
concerned with the organisation of speech sounds
into categories. Different languages use different
articulatory features to signal contrasts in meaning,
and when learning language, the child has to learn
which features to ignore and which to focus on (Kuhl,
2004).
In
both
research
and
clinical
practice,
most
emphasis has been placed on expressive phonolog-
ical problems: difficulties with speech production
that are linguistic in origin, rather than due to motor
impairment or physical abnormality of the articula-
tors. This kind of problem is identified when a child
fails to make a speech distinction between sounds
that are used to contrast meaning in the language
being learned, as when a child says ‘tea’ rather than
‘key’, substituting/t/for/k/. Phonological errors of
this kind are common in early development, but can
persist and, when numerous, impair intelligibility of
speech. Phonological problems in preschoolers that
are not accompanied by other language problems are
a relatively common reason for referral to a SLT/P
and often respond well to specialist intervention
(Law, Garrett, & Nye, 2003). Thus, they would not
meet our criteria for DLD because the prognosis is
good. The more general term ‘Speech Sound Disor-
der’ (SSD) can be used for such cases: this is an
umbrella term that also includes problems with
speech production that have motor or physical
origins, or involve misarticulations such as a lisp,
where a sound is produced in a distorted way
without losing the contrast with other sounds. The
classification of and terminology for disorders of
speech sound production is a subject of considerable
debate (Waring & Knight, 2013). In practice, even for
those with specialist skills, it is not always easy to
distinguish
between
phonological
disorders
and
other types of speech production problem.
Where phonological problems continue beyond
5 years of age it is important to assess the child’s
broader language skills, as persisting phonological
difficulties are usually accompanied by other lan-
guage problems and have a poorer prognosis (Bird,
Bishop, & Freeman, 1995; Bishop & Edmundson,
1987; Hayiou-Thomas, Carroll, Leavett, Hulme, &
Snowling, 2017), so would merit a diagnosis of DLD.
Where the child has a mixture of language disorder
and motor or structural problems with speech pro-
duction, a dual diagnosis of DLD with SSD is
appropriate.
Some children have impairment affecting phono-
logical awareness, that is they have difficulty explic-
itly categorising and manipulating the sounds of
language. For instance, they may be unable to
identify the three phonemes constituting the word
‘cat’, or to recognise that ‘cat’ and ‘car’ begin with the
same phoneme. Phonological awareness has been
studied extensively in children with reading disabil-
ity, where it is commonly impaired, even in children
with normal speech production. Although phonolog-
ical awareness is often deficient in children with
DLD, we would not diagnose DLD on the basis of
poor phonological awareness alone, because it is a
metalinguistic skill that can be as much a conse-
quence as a cause of literacy problems (Wimmer,
Landerl, Linortner, & Hummer, 1991).
Syntax:
A
considerable
body
of
research
has
focused on documenting syntactic impairments in
children with DLD (Van der Lely, 2005). Expressive
problems with morpho-syntax are of particular the-
oretical interest, and there have been contrasting
attempts to account for them in terms of linguistic
and processing theories (Leonard, 2014). Receptive
language impairments affecting syntax can also
occur, with children failing to interpret meaning
conveyed by grammatical contrasts (Hsu & Bishop,
2014), or showing problems in distinguishing gram-
matical from ungrammatical sentence forms (Rice,
Wexler, & Redmond, 1999).
Word finding and semantics:
Some children strug-
gle to produce words despite having some knowledge
of their meaning – these are known as ‘word finding

 difficulties’ (Messer & Dockrell, 2006). Others have
limited knowledge of word meanings – a problem that
comes under the domain of lexical semantics. The
child may be poor at understanding multiple word
meanings and/or use a restricted vocabulary. The
latter problem has been particularly noted in verb
use, where the term ‘general all-purpose verbs’ has
been coined to describe this phenomenon (Kamba-
naros & Grohmann, 2015; Rice & Bode, 1993).
Semantic impairments also encompass problems
with expressing or understanding meaning from
word combinations; for example, understanding the
scope of the quantifier (all/none) in sentences such
as ‘all the pens are in the boxes’ or ‘none of the pens
are in the boxes’ (Katsos, Roqueta, Estevan, &
Cummins, 2011).
Pragmatics/language use:
Pragmatic difficulties
affect the appropriate production or comprehension
of language in a given context. They include such
characteristics as providing too much or too little
information to a conversational partner, insensitivity
to social cues in conversation, being over-literal in
comprehension and having difficulty understanding
figurative language (Adams, 2002). Prosodic abnor-
malities, in which cues such as intonation and stress
are used idiosyncratically, so speech sounds robotic,
stereotyped or otherwise atypical to the context, can
also be disruptive to social communication. These
difficulties
are
hallmarks
of
the
communicative
problems seen in ASD, but are also found in children
who do not meet criteria for autism.
Specific
terminology
has
been
proposed
for
nonautistic children with pragmatic impairments.
In ICD-11, the term pragmatic language impairment
is used as a descriptive qualifier within DLD. In
DSM-5, a new category of social (pragmatic) com-
munication disorder (SPCD) has been introduced –
see Baird and Norbury (2016).
We
considered
adopting
the
DSM-5
term
in
CATALISE, but decided against this for several
reasons. First, in DSM-5, SPCD is seen as a new
category of neurodevelopmental disorder, whereas
we regard pragmatics as part of language, and hence
pragmatic impairment as a type of language disor-
der. Second, the label SPCD emphasises social
communication, rather than language; in contrast,
our focus is on linguistic problems.
Interventions are being developed that address
linguistic as well as social aspects of such commu-
nication problems (Adams, 2008), and a focus on
pragmatic language as a feature of DLD should help
direct children to appropriate intervention.
Discourse:
In contexts such as narrative, children
must learn to process sequences of utterances, so
that they form a coherent whole. Children who lack
this ability may produce sequences of utterances
that appear disconnected and hard to follow. They
may also experience comprehension failure if they
interpret one sentence at a time, without drawing the
necessary inferences to link them together (Karasin-
ski & Weismer, 2010).
Verbal learning and memory:
The research litera-
ture has shown that many children with DLD have
problems in retaining sequences of sounds or words
over a short delay (verbal short-term memory),
learning associations between words and meaning,
or learning statistical patterns in sequential input
(Archibald & Gathercole, 2006; Bishop, North, &
Donlan, 1996; Campbell, Dollaghan, Needleman, &
Janosky, 1997; Conti-Ramsden, 2003; Ellis Weis-
mer, 1996; Gillam, Cowan, & Day, 1995; Leonard
2007; Lum, Conti-Ramsden, Page, & Ullman, 2012;
Lum & Zarafa, 2010; Montgomery, 2002). Their
language limitations are different from those due to
poor hearing or auditory discrimination, or to lack of
knowledge due to unfamiliarity with the ambient
language.
Statements 2–11 are synthesised in Figure 1.
Statement 12.
It can be useful to have a super-
ordinate category for policymakers, because the
number of children with specific needs in the domain
of
speech,
language
and
communication
has
resource implications. The term Speech, Language
and Communication Needs (SLCN), already in use in
educational services in the United Kingdom, is
recommended for this purpose.
Supplementary comment.
DLD can be viewed as a
subset within a broad category that covers the whole
range of problems affecting speech, language and
communication, regardless of the type of problem or
putative aetiology.
As shown in Figure 2, this is a very broad category
that encompasses children with DLD (as defined
above), and also includes cases where problems have
a clear physical basis (e.g. dysarthria), or affect
speech fluency or voice. Also included here are
children who have needs due to limited familiarity
with the language used in the classroom, and those
who have communication difficulties as part of other
differentiating conditions.
It is not anticipated that this terminology will be
useful for those doing research on the nature or
causes of language disorders, nor will it be helpful in
explaining a child’s difficulties to parents or in
determining a treatment pathway. It could, however,
serve a purpose for those who need to plan services,
who may need to estimate how many children are
likely to require additional support and to bridge
across professional divides (McKean et al., 2017). In
addition, it recognises children who have language
needs that may require extra help or accommoda-
tions in the classroom, even if they do not have a
language disorder. These would include those who
are shown in pathways terminating in a bullet in the
flow chart in Figure 1, that is children with milder

 difficulties who should respond well to classroom
modification, children with hearing loss who use
sign language or children who have had limited
exposure to the ambient language.
General discussion
Despite the geographical and professional diversity of
the panel, there were some points of broad agree-
ment, as follows: first, some children have language

 problems that are severe and persistent enough to
create long-term functional challenges, in daily com-
munication and/or educational attainment; second,
there is no clear dividing line between normality and
disorder; third, within the domain of language,
children’s problems do not neatly segregate into
subtypes, and there may be overlap between prob-
lems in speech, language and communication.
A complicating factor in the nosology of language
disorders is that it has in the past been based on
information from a mixture of different levels of
description:
information
about
the
severity
and
type of presenting problems with language; co-
occurring problems in nonlanguage domains, such
as nonverbal ability, social interaction or attention;
and putative biological and environmental causes,
such as brain damage, a genetic syndrome or social
disadvantage. This approach implies that the con-
stellation of verbal and nonverbal skills will map
onto natural subtypes with distinct causes, such
that
we
can
use
the
linguistic,
cognitive
and
behavioural profile to distinguish the child whose
language problems have environmental or genetic
origins. However, this approach has not worked. As
research has progressed, it has become evident
that causes of language disorders are complex and
multifactorial,
and
there is
no
neat
one-to-one
mapping between aetiology and phenotype.
In many ways, the results of this consensus
exercise
may
seem
unsurprising.
The
principal
recommended term, DLD, has a long history in the
field, and is compatible with planned usage in ICD-
11 and close to the term (Language Disorder) used
in
DSM-5.
It
was
one
of
four
possible
terms
considered in Bishop’s (2014) original review of
terminology, and already had reasonable represen-
tation in a Google Scholar search. For many of those
working in this area, however, this represents quite
a radical departure from previous practice. The
term Specific Language Impairment, which was the
most
frequent
in
the
research
literature,
was
the subject of substantial disagreement among the
panel, with strong arguments being put forward
both for its retention and its rejection. Ultimately,
the decision was made to reject the term. A major
drawback of this decision
is that
it creates a
discontinuity
with
prior
literature,
which
could
affect future meta-analyses and systematic reviews.
On balance, however, it was concluded that the
term ‘specific’ had connotations that were mislead-
ing and confusing and that, rather than redefining
the term, it would be better to abolish it.
There are other aspects of terminology where the
Delphi process exposed points of disagreement, but
also clarified reasons for these and so allowed us to
identify ways forward. Discussions about the term
‘disorder’ revealed principled objections by those
who were concerned about medicalisation of normal
developmental variation. At the same time, concerns
were expressed that other terminology might trivi-
alise the challenges experienced by children who
had persistent problems that interfered with their
social and educational development. The solution
we adopted was to retain ‘disorder’ but define it in a
way that required functional problems with a poor
prognosis. This may seem a small change, but it
does
have
major
implications.
In
particular,
it
cautions against defining language disorder solely
in terms of statistical cut-offs on language tests.
Note also that we reject any attempt to use discrep-
ancy scores to draw a distinction between ‘disorder’
and ‘delay’: the term ‘language delay’ was widely
rejected by our panel members as confusing and
illogical.
The main challenge facing those attempting to use
the concept of language disorder that we advocate is
that there are few valid assessments of functional
language and relatively limited evidence regarding
prognostic indicators. More longitudinal research is
needed, using designs that allow us to predict
individual outcomes rather than just characterise
group averages.
A further case where the Delphi process helped
identify sticking points was the treatment of ‘exclu-
sionary
factors’.
We
hope
that
our
distinction
between differentiating conditions, risk factors and
co-occurring disorders will be helpful here. Only
differentiating
conditions,
which
correspond
to
biomedical disorders that are clearly associated with
language problems, are distinguished diagnostically
from DLD. Risk factors and co-occurring disorders
are noted but do not preclude a diagnosis of DLD.
This contrasts with prior practice in some quarters,
where a child’s social background or presence of
problems in other developmental areas could leave a
child without a diagnosis, and hence without access
to support.
Finally, although it was generally agreed that there
is considerable heterogeneity in children with DLD,
we
failed
to
reach
consensus
about
possible

ent diagnostic terms. DLD is nested within the broader SLCN

 terminology for linguistic subtypes of DLD. It is
possible that as research advances the situation may
change, but another possibility is that it is a conse-
quence of the phenomenon of interest: quite simply,
children with DLD do not neatly divide into subtypes
along linguistic lines. It is likely that there is
substantial aetiological as well as linguistic hetero-
geneity, just as has been found for the related
conditions of ASD (Coe, Girirajan, & Eichler, 2012)
and
developmental
dyslexia
(Raskind,
Peter,
Richards, Eckert, & Berninger, 2012). In addition,
the boundaries between DLD and other neurodevel-
opmental disorders are not clearcut (Bishop & Rut-
ter, 2008). In our current state of knowledge, we
propose that the appropriate course of action is to
document the heterogeneity rather than attempting
to apply a categorical nosology that fails to accom-
modate a large proportion of children.
An obvious limitation of this study is that we
restricted our focus to the English language because
of the difficulties of devising terms that would be
applicable across different language and cultures.
We recommend the use of the Delphi method to
researchers working with language disorders in
other languages, as a good way to achieve better
consensus.
As with our previous Delphi study, this exercise has
revealed the urgent need for further research on
children’s language disorders, including studies on
intervention, models of service delivery, epidemiology,
prognosis, linguistic profiles and functional limita-
tions over time. We hope that by clarifying terminology
in this area we will also make it easier to raise
awareness of children’s language problems.

Delphi consensus on terminology for language problems
1077
 Key points
• Some children have problems with language development that cause significant interference with everyday
life or educational progress. Terminology for describing such problems has been inconsistent, hampering
communication, leading to inequity over access to services and confusion in synthesising research.
• A group of experts representing a range of professions and English-speaking countries using the Delphi
method, came to a consensus that ‘Developmental Language Disorder’ (DLD) is the preferred term for
language problems that are severe enough to interfere with daily life, have a poor prognosis and are not
associated with a clear biomedical aetiology.
• We replace the traditional exclusionary criteria in the definition of language disorder, with a threefold
distinction between differentiating conditions, risk factors and co-occurring conditions.
• We provide guidelines about terminology in this area that can be used in clinical and research contexts.
