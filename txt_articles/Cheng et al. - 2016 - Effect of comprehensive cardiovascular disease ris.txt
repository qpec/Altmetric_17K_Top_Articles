Introduction: The aim of the study was to examine changes in carotid inti-
ma-media thickness (CIMT) and carotid plaque morphology in patients re-
ceiving multifactorial cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factor management 
in a community-based prevention clinic. Quantitative changes in CIMT and 
qualitative changes in carotid plaque morphology may be measured non-in-
vasively by ultrasound.
Material and methods: This is a retrospective study on a cohort of 324 pa- 
tients who received multifactorial cardiovascular risk reduction treatment 
at a community prevention clinic. All patients received lipid-lowering medi-
cations (statin, niacin, and/or ezetimibe) and lifestyle modification. All pa-
tients underwent at least one follow-up CIMT measurement after starting 
their regimen. Annual biomarker, CIMT, and plaque measurements were an-
alyzed for associations with CVD risk reduction treatment.
Results: Median time to last CIMT was 3.0 years. Compared to baseline, fol-
low-up analysis of all treatment groups at 2 years showed a 52.7% decrease 
in max CIMT, a 3.0% decrease in mean CIMT, and an 87.0% decrease in the 
difference between max and mean CIMT (p < 0.001). Plaque composition 
changes occurred, including a decrease in lipid-rich plaques of 78.4% with-
in the first 2 years (p < 0.001). After the first 2 years, CIMT and lipid-rich 
plaques continued to decline at reduced rates. 
Conclusions: In a cohort of patients receiving comprehensive CVD risk reduc-
tion therapy, delipidation of subclinical carotid plaque and reductions in CIMT 
predominantly occurred within 2 years, and correlated with changes in tradition-
al biomarkers. These observations, generated from existing clinical data, provide 
unique insight into the longitudinal on-treatment changes in carotid plaque.

Introduction
The natural progression of atherosclerotic lesions has been described 
in many in-vitro and in-vivo studies. Studies have shown that changes in 
arterial intima-media thickness precede the formation of atherosclerot-
ic plaques [1, 2]. These intima-media changes are known as subclinical

atherosclerosis and can occur early in life without 
immediate clinical consequences. Non-invasive 
imaging modalities such as high-resolution mag-
netic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomog-
raphy (CT), and B-mode ultrasonography have 
been used to study longitudinal changes in ath-
erosclerotic lesions and plaque morphology [3–5]. 
Carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT) mea-
sured by B-mode ultrasonography is a potentially 
useful non-invasive method of detecting subclin-
ical atherosclerosis [6–9]. Compared to CT and 
MRI, B-mode ultrasound offers a low-cost and in-
formative research tool, without ionizing radiation, 
for analyzing plaque composition and monitoring 
changes in its lipid content [5, 10]. In particular, vul-
nerable plaques, which are soft and lipid-rich, can 
be identified on ultrasound by their echo-lucent 
appearance [5, 6]. Therefore, ultrasonography pro-
vides a non-invasive method of studying subclinical 
atherosclerosis and vulnerable plaque in response 
to comprehensive interventions. However, there 
are certain limitations to the use of CIMT in the 
clinical setting. Despite earlier supportive studies, 
recent meta-analyses question the value of CIMT 
as an additional predictor of cardiovascular disease 
(CVD) risk [11–20]. It received a class III recommen-
dation from the 2013 ACC/AHA lipid guidelines and 
is not recommended for use as a clinical marker for 
CVD risk [21]. As a research tool, ultrasonography 
provides a non-invasive and cost-effective method 
of changes in plaque morphology and CIMT.
Lipid-modifying therapy helps form the core of 
modern clinical interventions to alter progression 
of atherosclerotic lesions. However, combination 
lipid therapy is controversial as several clinical tri-
als have had mixed results (VA-HIT, HATS, and Ath-
erothrombosis Intervention in Metabolic Syndrome 
with Low HDL/High Triglyceride and Impact on 
Global Health Outcomes (AIM-HIGH)) [22–24]. The 
difference in outcomes may be explained in part 
by the variable effects of lipid-lowering therapies 
on subclinical atherosclerosis and differences in 
the populations studied. The direct effect of statins 
and niacin on subclinical atherosclerosis was inves-
tigated by several CIMT studies, which found that 
in low-intermediate risk individuals, statins and 
niacin were effective in slowing or reversing CIMT 
progression [25–31]. Aggressive short-term statin 
therapy has also been shown to promote delipi-
dation and stabilization of vulnerable plaque [32, 
33]. These favorable changes in plaque morphol-
ogy were observed using high-resolution optical 
coherence tomography and integrated backscatter 
intravascular ultrasound imaging [34].
Longitudinal ultrasound CIMT and plaque mor-
phology investigation offers a non-invasive and 
effective method to examine this progression. 
The goal of this retrospective study is to evalu-
ate changes in CIMT and plaque morphology in 
a community cohort of patients receiving compre-
hensive CVD risk factor management.
Material and methods
Demographics
The study is a retrospective cohort of 324 pa-
tients participating in a comprehensive CVD risk 
factor management program from 2003 to 2008 
in a community-based primary care clinic in the 
state of Washington. Out of 448 patients in this 
clinic (Spokane, Washington), 324 elected to par-
ticipate in this program. There were no eligibility 
criteria, and patients were not stratified based on 
CVD risk. All participants underwent baseline and 
annual physical and laboratory examinations and 
CIMT scans. This analysis was based on available 
data collected from program participants. The pri-
mary data collection team received institutional 
review board exemption from the Texas Tech Uni-
versity Health Sciences Center. The data analysis 
team received institutional review board exemp-
tion from the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine. 
Informed consent was not obtained from study 
participants for their clinical records to be used in 
this study. Patient records were anonymized and 
de-identified prior to analysis.
Treatment strategy
All patients received extensive behavioral, di-
etary and lifestyle counseling in keeping with 
accepted guideline practice [35, 36]. Clinicians 
reviewed laboratory data and CIMT imaging, and 
treated patients with statin, statin plus niacin, 
statin plus ezetimibe, or statin plus niacin and 
ezetimibe. Statin-intolerant patients were treat-
ed with ezetimibe plus niacin [37]. Retrospective 
grouping was based on their medication treat-
ment (Table I). Additional therapy with fibrates, 
bile acid sequestrants, and fish oils was also used 
as needed to achieve the more aggressive Nation-
al Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) ATP III 
 
lipid goals. Patients with a history of coronary 
artery disease (CAD) and/or hypertension were 
treated with standard low-dose aspirin 81 mg, 
angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi), 
angiotensin receptor blocker, β-blocker, diuretic, 
renin inhibitor, and/or clopidogrel as indicated. 
Patients with newly diagnosed insulin resistance, 
metabolic syndrome, and diabetes mellitus were 
started on oral insulin sensitizing agents, primari-
ly metformin and thiazolidinediones. 
Clinical and laboratory data
Baseline data included age, sex, height, weight, 
hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), high sensitivity C-reactive

protein (CRP), and history of CAD, diabetes, or cig-
arette smoking. Body mass index (BMI) was not 
routinely measured, and baseline insulin use was 
not available. Blood pressure measurements and 
laboratory lipid samples were collected within 
6 months of the annual CIMT scan and annually 
thereafter. Total cholesterol, high-density lipopro-
tein cholesterol (HDL-C), and triglycerides were 
directly measured. Non-high-density lipoprotein 
cholesterol (non-HDL-C) was calculated as the 
difference between total cholesterol and HDL-C, 
while estimated low-density lipoprotein choles-
terol (LDL-C) was calculated using the Friedewald 
equation [38]. Baseline HbA1c was collected for all 
study participants. During the 5-year follow-up, 
1131 HbA1c measurements were obtained out of 
the 1548 follow-up data points. Baseline high-sen-
sitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) was collected 
for 471 out of 571 study participants. During the 
5-year follow-up, 1303 hs-CRP measurements were 
obtained out of the 1548 follow-up data points. 
B-mode ultrasound imaging
Certified sonographers at CardioRisk laborato-
ries (South Jordan, UT) performed all annual CIMT 
scans. CIMT examinations were performed using 
Sonosite Titan systems equipped with high-reso-
lution B-mode ultrasound with 10-5 MHz, 38-mm 
linear array transducers (Sonosite Inc, Bothell, WA). 
CIMT measurements were obtained using 
well-defined anatomic markers in the distal 1 cm 
of the common carotid artery, the carotid bifur-
cation, and the proximal 1 cm of the internal ca-
rotid artery [39]. On average, 800 measurements 
were made at each anatomic carotid site using 
edge-detection software included with the Sonos-
ite Titan systems. Mean CIMT was the average 
of all measurements, and max CIMT was the av-
erage of the 6 thickest CIMT measurements (in-
cluding regions with plaque). Carotid plaque was 
defined as a focal lesion at least 1.3 mm at its 
thickest point. Plaques were classified into three 
echo-density categories representing lipid-rich 
(echo-lucent), heterogeneous, and calcified (echo-
dense) plaque. Plaque burden was the sum of the 
maximum thickness in each of the three measure-
ment sites bilaterally. 
Data collection
Research assistants collected data from clin-
ic charts and removed patient identifiers. A data 
spreadsheet was generated, and a separate data 
analysis team reviewed the data to ensure integ-
rity. Any missing or mistyped values were flagged 
and sent back to the data collection team for re-
examination. After corrections were made, the da-
tabase was locked for analysis.
Data analysis
Patients were retrospectively categorized into 
lipid treatment groups: statin only, niacin only, 
ezetimibe only, statin plus niacin, statin plus ezeti-
mibe, statin plus niacin and ezetimibe. The dates 
of the annual CIMT study served as the primary 
analysis time point, and clinical and laboratory 
data obtained within 6 months of that CIMT mea-
surement were attributed to that date.
Statistical analysis
We examined the outcome measures of mean 
and max CIMT and plaque composition. Statistical 
analyses were performed using ANOVA, χ2 test, 
Fisher’s exact, or median test, with p-values gen-

erated by the Wald test as appropriate. Analyses 
were performed on mean, max, and max minus 
mean (max–mean) CIMT, and plaque type (soft, 
heterogeneous and calcified). Changes in CIMT 
were evaluated using multilevel mixed-effects 
linear or logistic regression models with a pa-
tient-level random intercept. Patients lost to fol-
low-up were censored at the last CIMT scan and 
were not adjusted for missing data bias.
Results
Patient baseline results
The study population included 324 Caucasian 
patients with at least two CIMT scans. Baseline 
demographic comparisons are shown in Table I. 
Briefly, the study population had a mean age of 
 
55 years, 39% were female, 13% had CAD, 5% had 
diabetes, and 32% were current or former smok-
ers. The median time to the last CIMT was 3.0 
years with a follow-up of 280 (86%), 234 (72%), 
167 (52%), 85 (26%), and 20 (6%) patients at each 
of the first 5 years (Table II). 
Treatment groups
Patients received comprehensive CVD risk inter-
vention including diet and physical activity coun-
seling and pharmacotherapy. Within the first year, 
pharmacotherapy was significantly increased. 
Statin use increased from 46% to 87%, niacin 
use from 16% to 68%, ezetimibe use from 5% to 
15%, and ACEi use from 36% to 77% (Figure 1). 
 
Baseline treatment group categorizations are 
shown in Table I.
Lipid, HbA1c, hs-CRP, and blood pressure 
changes
There were statistically significant improve-
ments in lipid parameters and systolic blood pres-
sure during the first year of treatment, with stable 
trends afterwards (Table II). LDL-C decreased by 
25%, non-HDL-C decreased by 25%, triglycerides 
decreased by 31%, HDL-C increased by 6%, and 
systolic blood pressure decreased by 5% (Table II, 
 
Figure 2). The mean and median HbA1c value at 
baseline was 5.5%, with a standard deviation of 
0.7%, interquartile range of 5.2% to 5.7%, and to-
tal range of 4.3% to 10.8%. There was not a signif-
icant association between HbA1c and mean CIMT 
in a mixed model analysis over time. Mean hs-CRP 
at baseline was 1.1 mg/l, with a standard devia-
tion of 2.3 mg/l, interquartile range of 0.5 mg/l to 
2.1 mg/l, and total range of 0.1 mg/l to 15.7 mg/l. 
There was not a significant association between 
hs-CRP and mean CIMT in a mixed model analysis 
over time.
CIMT findings
Statistically significant changes in CIMT and 
plaque composition occurred across all treatment 
groups (Figure 3). There was no statistically signifi-
cant difference in CIMT between treatment groups. 
Average max CIMT at baseline was 1.86 mm, aver-
age mean CIMT was 0.77 mm, and average max-
mean CIMT was 1.08 mm. After 1 year, max CIMT 
was 1.31 mm (30% regression), average mean 
CIMT was 0.73 mm (5% regression), and max-
mean CIMT was 0.57 mm (47% regression), p < 
0.001. After 2 years, max CIMT was 0.88 mm (52% 
regression year-on-year) and max-mean CIMT was 
0.14 mm (87% regression year-on-year), p < 0.001 
(Table III). Mean CIMT continued to remain stable 
between 0.73 and 0.78 mm. 
Lipid-rich plaque, defined as echolucent plaque 
on ultrasonography, decreased by 50% the first 
year and 56% the second year, p < 0.001. There 
was a 36% increase in heterogeneous plaque and 
a 43% increase in calcified plaque after the first 
year (p < 0.001). There was no significant change 
in the amount of detectable plaque after the first 
year of starting treatment (p = 0.076) (Table III).

 Effect of comprehensive cardiovascular disease risk management on longitudinal changes in carotid artery intima-media thickness 
 
in a community-based prevention clinic
Arch Med Sci 4, August / 2016 
733
Discussion
The aim of this study was to longitudinally 
evaluate the effect of comprehensive CVD risk 
intervention on subclinical carotid atheroscle-
rosis. Using serial B-mode ultrasonography, we 
observed significant regression of CIMT (max, 
max–mean) and lipid-rich plaque. Previous CIMT 
studies using statin therapy alone showed reduc-
tion in CIMT progression, not regression [25–28, 
30]. CIMT regression has been demonstrated in 
the setting of niacin monotherapy [29] as well 
as in comprehensive CVD risk reduction therapy, 
although the latter was confounded by patients 
receiving carotid endarterectomies [40]. Our study 
showed significant CIMT regression as well as re-
gression of subclinical atherosclerotic plaque in 
response to a comprehensive treatment strategy 
with high prevalence of use of niacin in multiple 
drug combination therapy.

Studies using high-resolution computed to-
mography, magnetic resonance imaging, and 
B-mode ultrasonography found that aggressive 
lipid-lowering therapies stabilize plaque by pro-
moting delipidation of vulnerable plaque [32–34, 
41, 42]. These studies correlated decreasing pla- 
que lucency on ultrasound with decreased lipid 
content of plaque. Compared with CT, ultrasonog-
raphy offers advantages in research and clinical 
settings through lower cost and absence of ioniz-
ing radiation exposure. 
Our study expands on the previously published 
CIMT studies by including a comprehensive diet, 
lifestyle, and intensive, multiple drug pharmaco-
logical intervention. There was a robust decrease 
in lipid-rich plaque during the first 2 years of treat-
ment followed by a steady decline at later time 
points. Delipidation of subclinical plaque was as-
sociated with reductions in LDL-C and non-HDL-C, 
and was best explained by the summary effects of 
comprehensive behavioral and dietary prevention 
interventions in combination with statin-based 
lipid-lowering regimens directed toward reduction 
in non-HDL-C and LDL-C to target levels.
There are several limitations to this study. As 
a retrospective study, we encountered issues with 
incomplete clinical data such as family history, 
obesity, and duration of baseline medication use, 
which could cause residual confounding. Another 
limitation was retrospective grouping of treat-
ment groups, which can introduce bias if groups 
are incorrectly assigned. The study population was 
composed of a self-selected group of motivated 
Caucasian patients, which may impact the gen-
eralizability of this study. We modeled our study 
to examine yearly changes in CIMT, plaque, and 
lipids based on the study design of prior clinical 
trials. There may be long-term effects on CIMT 
and plaque composition beyond the duration of 
our study that may be revealed with a larger pop-
ulation size with longer follow-up.
In conclusion, this study examined multi-year 
CIMT and plaque changes in a cohort of patients re-
ceiving comprehensive CVD risk intervention. Using 
serial imaging, we observed a reduction of lipid-rich 
plaques with a concurrent increase in heterogeneous 
and calcific plaques, suggesting regression of lipid- 
rich plaque or transformation into heterogeneous 
and calcified forms. We believe that understanding 
the progression of subclinical atherosclerosis will 
help shape our approach to CVD prevention. These 
results show the beneficial effect of comprehensive, 
evidence-based lipid management on subclinical 
atherosclerosis and vulnerable plaque.
