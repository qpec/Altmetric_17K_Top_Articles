 Is It My Cancer or Am I Just Getting Older?: Impact of Cancer
on Age-Related Health Conditions of Older Cancer Survivors

BACKGROUND: The extent to which cancer exacerbates or creates new health conditions is a long-standing, unanswered question.
The current prospective study examined the short-term impact of cancer on the functioning, development of, and worsening of age-
related health conditions among older adults who develop cancer compared with age-matched controls. METHODS: Surveillance, Epi-
demiology, and End Results registry data were linked with Medicare Health Outcomes Survey (MHOS) data. A total of 921 eligible
cases were Medicare beneficiaries with diagnosis of breast, colorectal, lung, or prostate cancer made between their baseline and
follow-up MHOS. Using propensity score matching, 4605 controls without cancer were matched from the MHOS. Analysis of covari-
ance and logistic regression were used to examine changes in physical functioning, activities of daily living, age-related conditions,
and exacerbation of preexisting conditions for cases compared with controls. RESULTS: Cancer groups demonstrated greater
declines in activities of daily living and physical function compared with controls (mean, -1.53 [standard error, 0.14]), with the greatest
change noted for patients with lung cancer (mean, -6.72 [standard error, 0.94]). Having a cancer diagnosis increased the risk of
depression but did not increase the odds of developing arthritis in the hand and/or hip, urinary incontinence (except for prostate can-
cer), or vision and/or hearing problems. Having a cancer diagnosis also did not exacerbate the severity of arthritis or foot neuropathy.
CONCLUSIONS: The findings of the current study suggest that cancer is a stronger driver for declines in physical functioning and an
increased risk of depression in older adults. Interventions are needed to decrease these risks. Clinicians need to prepare patients and
families for changes in functioning levels and interventions that limit the declines for older patients with cancer are needed. Cancer

INTRODUCTION
The extent to which cancer exacerbates existing health conditions and/or creates new health conditions in older adults is a
long-standing, unanswered question.1 By 2030, nearly 1 in 5 US residents will be aged >65 years.2 From 2008 to 2030,
the percentage of cancers diagnosed in older adults is estimated to increase from 61% to 70%.3 Many older cancer survi-
vors have experienced, or eventually will experience, other age-related health problems, such as functional decline, arthri-
tis, sensory impairment, and urinary incontinence. As the population of older adults grows, it will be even more important
for clinicians to understand the unique impact of cancer on the health status of older adults and to develop strategies to
optimize their health.
What is known about the impact of cancer on health conditions and functioning among older adults comes from a
few cross-sectional studies of patients with cancer compared with controls.4-8 These studies have shown a higher preva-
lence of urinary incontinence,4,6 depression,4,7 functional limitations,4,8 falls, hearing difficulties, lower self-reported
health,4 and higher rates of frailty5 among individuals with a cancer history compared with those without cancer after con-
trolling for comorbidities. However, a large population-based study found that the presence of existing comorbid condi-
tions rather than a history of cancer was associated with decrements in activities of daily living (ADLs).9 Although these
studies are informative, disentangling the independent effects of cancer versus normative aging is complex because of an
absence of prediagnosis health data, homogeneous and/or highly selective patient populations, and the lack of age-
matched comparison groups.10
In 2007, data from the Medicare Health Outcomes Survey (MHOS), a prospective study of Medicare beneficiaries
from each managed care plan under contract with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, were linked with the

 Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) pro-
gram, a group of population-based cancer registries spon-
sored by the National Cancer Institute. This linkage of
data created what to the best of our knowledge is the first
prospective, population-based data set of patients with
cancer aged �65 years.11 The SEER-MHOS data set is a
subgroup of the larger MHOS and SEER data sets; it
includes individuals diagnosed with cancer who com-
pleted MHOS surveys before and after their cancer diag-
nosis. Another benefit of linking these data is the ability to
examine changes in health status among older patients
with cancer compared with matched control subjects
drawn from the same population base.
The objectives of the current prospective study were:
1) to examine the impact of cancer on functioning (physi-
cal function and ADLs); 2) to explore whether cancer
increases the risk of developing age-related health condi-
tions, including sensory impairment, urinary inconti-
nence, depression, and arthritis; and 3) to examine
whether cancer exacerbates preexisting health conditions
(severity of foot neuropathy and severity of arthritis pain)
of older individuals enrolled in a Medicare managed care
program compared with age-matched controls.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Participants and Procedures
Study participants were men and women enrolled in the
MHOS with linked data from the SEER program. Details
of the survey design, recruitment procedures, and data
linkage methods were published in earlier work with this
data set.11,12 The MHOS data used for the SEER-MHOS
project includes individuals who were selected to respond
to the MHOS between 1998 and 2001 and their 2-year
follow-up surveys (for years contained in the SEER-
MHOS linkage, see healthcaredelivery.cancer.gov/seer-
mhos/).
Response rates for the baseline survey in SEER
regions ranged from 64.1% in 1998 to 71.6% in 2000.
Follow-up response rates ranged from 76.3% to 84.9%,
resulting in a sample size of 11,612 MHOS respondents
linked to SEER across the 4 cohorts. Of the 11,612
respondents, 1930 had surveys taken before and after a
cancer diagnosis. To examine our research questions by
cancer site, analyses focused on the 4 most prevalent can-
cers diagnosed in older adults (320 breast cancer cases,
436 prostate cancer cases, 240 colorectal cancer cases, and
112 non-small cell lung cancer cases) and excluded
patients with in situ and stage IV disease, which resulted
in an analytic sample of 921 cancer cases with a mean of
12.4 months (standard deviation [SD], 7.1 months) from
cancer diagnosis to follow-up survey.
Measures
Demographic and health characteristics
Self-reported sociodemographic information from the
MHOS included age, sex, education level, race, marital
status, and change in marital status from baseline to
follow-up. Health-related characteristics included smok-
ing status (never/former/current), presence of 12 preexist-
ing conditions (yes/no) (see list in Table 1), presence of
newly diagnosed conditions (yes/no) (same list as for pre-
existing conditions), and history of cancer. We classified
chronic medical conditions that existed before the base-
line MHOS assessment as “preexisting” conditions and
conditions that were diagnosed between baseline and
follow-up MHOS assessments as “newly diagnosed” con-
ditions. Two comorbidity indices, 1 for preexisting condi-
tions and 1 for newly diagnosed conditions, were created
weighting the conditions based on their association with
physical
aspects
for
health-related
quality
of
life
(HRQOL) to avoid treating each condition as having
equal impact on physical aspects of HRQOL.13
Physical function
The Short Form (36) Health Survey (SF-36) Physical
Component Summary (PCS) is widely used and has been
validated in cancer care studies.14 A change score was cal-
culated from baseline PCS to follow-up PCS. Self-
reported ADLs include difficulties with 6 items: bathing,
dressing, eating, getting in and out of chairs, walking, and
using the toilet. Participants were asked “Because of a
health or physical problem, do you have any difficulty
doing the following activities (yes, limited a lot/yes, lim-
ited a little/no, not limited at all)?”.
Age-related health conditions
Participants who reported having arthritis in their hip
and/or hand were asked: “During the past 4 weeks, how
would you describe the arthritis pain you usually had?”
(none/very mild/mild/moderate/severe). Neuropathy in
the feet was measured using 2 questions with the same
response options (none of the time/little to some of the
time/most to all of the time): 1) “During the past 4 weeks,
how much have you had numbness or loss of feeling in
your feet?” and 2) “During the past 4 weeks, how much of
the time have you had tingling or burning sensation in
your feet, especially at night?” These 2 items were aver-
aged together and reverse-scored, with a higher score rep-
resenting a higher level of neuropathy in the feet. Sensory

 impairment was measured both for vision (“Can you see
well enough to read newspaper print [with your glasses or
contacts if that’s how you see best]?) and hearing (“Can
you hear most of the things people say [with a hearing aid
if that’s how you hear best]?”) (yes/no). Urinary inconti-
nence was assessed by asking “Do you have difficulty con-
trolling urination?” (yes/no). Being at risk of developing
major depressive disorder (MDD) was measured as an af-
firmative response to any of the following 3 yes/no ques-
tions: 1) “In the past year, have you had 2 weeks or more
during which you felt sad, blue or depressed; or when you
lost interest or pleasure in things that you usually cared
about or enjoyed?”; 2) “In the past year, have you felt
depressed or sad much of the time?”; or 3) “Have you ever
had 2 years or more in your life when you felt depressed or
sad most days, even if you felt okay sometimes?”15
Statistical Analyses
To minimize potential confounding when examining dif-
ferences between cases (with cancer) and controls (without
cancer; n 5 4605), controls were matched to cases using
propensity score-matching procedures based on baseline
education level, age, sex, race/ethnicity, marital status,
smoking status, assessment mode (mail or telephone inter-
view), self-report or proxy response (at baseline and at
follow-up), and 10 preexisting health conditions (exclud-
ing arthritis or cancer) (Table 1). Five control participants
were matched to every 1 (cancer) case participant, as
described elsewhere.13,16
Separate analyses were run examining the impact of
cancer on functional status and preexisting health

 conditions. Separate mixed effects analysis of covariance
(ANCOVA) models were run, adjusting for clustering
due to health care plan membership and matched pairs,
for changes in foot neuropathy, arthritis pain, physical
function, and ADLs from baseline to follow-up in cases
compared with controls. Covariates in each model
included weighted preexisting and newly diagnosed medi-
cal conditions (excluding arthritis in the 2 arthritis
ANCOVA models), education level, age, sex, race/ethnic-
ity, marital status, change in marital status from baseline
to follow-up, smoking status, assessment mode, and self-
report/proxy response. Adjustments using Dunnett-Hsu-
adjusted P values were made for multiple comparisons for
changes in HRQOL among the cancer cases and controls
(a < .05).
Descriptive and separate logistic regression models
were used to examine the relative odds of developing age-
related conditions (visual impairment, auditory impair-
ment, urinary incontinence, risk of MDD, and arthritis)
for each cancer type compared with control subjects. The
covariates included in the ANCOVA analyses above also
were included in all logistic regression models as well as
the baseline measure of the outcome. Previous SEER-
MHOS analyses have found no differences between the
method used in the current study and when propensity

RESULTS
Sample Description
Characteristics of 921 patients with cancer and 4605
matched controls are shown in Table 1. After propensity
score matching, the only statistical difference between the
groups was that a higher percentage of the cancer sample
(12.71%) had a proxy response at follow-up compared
with the non-cancer matched sample (9.68%). All other
sociodemographic, survey, and health variables were not
found to be statistically different between the groups.
Does Cancer Impact Functioning?
At baseline, the PCS was 43.4 (SD, 12.1) for controls,
44.9 (SD, 11.0) for prostate cancer, 41.0 (SD, 12.8) for
breast cancer, 40.8 (SD, 12.2) for colorectal cancer, and
40.6 (SD, 12.3) for lung cancer cases. A 2-point difference
in the PCS score represents minimally important differen-
ces.17 As shown in Table 2, all cancer groups demon-
strated significant (adjusted P<.05) declines, and all
exceeded the minimally important difference in mean
physical function over time in comparison with the
matched controls. Patients with lung cancer were found
to have the greatest mean change in PCS from baseline to
follow-up (controls: 21.53 [SE, 0.14]; and lung cancer
cases: 26.72 [SE, 0.94]).
As shown in Table 3, significantly (adjusted P<.05)
larger declines in specific ADLs occurred over time for
cancer cases compared with controls. The most pervasive
changes were for patients with lung cancer with regard to
bathing (12% to 22%), dressing (8% to 19%), eating (5%
to 14%), and getting in and out of chairs (21% to 34%).
Significant changes over time also occurred for patients
with colorectal cancer with regard to dressing (11% to
18%). The patients with prostate and breast cancer did
not demonstrate significant declines in ADL domains
compared with controls after covariate adjustment. As
shown in Table 4, only the patients with lung cancer
(mean change, 20.68) reported larger overall declines in
sum ADLs compared with the control group (mean
change, 20.22).
Does Cancer Increase the Risk of Developing
New Health Conditions?
Depression
A greater number of patients with cancer endorsed at least
1 of the depression questions at follow-up compared with
controls (Table 5). In particular, patients with colorectal
cancer (odds ratio [OR], 1.75; 95% confidence interval
[95% CI], 1.21-2.52) and prostate cancer (OR, 1.47;
95% CI, 1.08-1.98) were found to have higher odds of
being at risk of MDD at follow-up compared with the
matched control group.
Urinary incontinence
At baseline, approximately 25% of respondents reported
having difficulty controlling their urination (23% in the
control group, 25% among patients with colorectal can-
cer, 20% among patients with lung cancer, 34% among
patients with breast cancer, and 23% among patients with
prostate cancer). In general, the percentage of respondents
reporting urinary incontinence did not increase at follow-
up (25% in the control group, 27% among patients with
colorectal cancer, 23% among patients with lung cancer,
33% among patients with breast cancer, and 41% among
patients with prostate cancer). Patients with prostate can-
cer did have higher odds of urinary incontinence com-
pared with controls at follow-up (OR, 3.28; 95% CI,
2.53-4.25) after controlling for baseline incontinence and
other covariates.
Arthritis
The percentage of newly diagnosed arthritis in the hand
or hip from baseline to follow-up was similar among cases

Cancer
June 15, 2016
1949
 and controls (increase of 2%). Among the cancer cases,
patients with breast cancer (increase of 4%) and prostate
cancer (increase of 6%) reported higher rates of newly
developed arthritis compared with patients with colorectal
cancer (decrease of 0.5%) and lung cancer (increase of
2%). However, no statistically significant differences were
found between cases and controls.
Sensory impairment
Having a cancer diagnosis did not appear to increase the
odds of developing vision or hearing problems versus con-
trols after controlling for baseline sensory impairment and
other variables. A compromised ability to read newspaper
print did not significantly change from baseline to follow-
up for any group (control group: 5.0% to 5.4%; patients
with colorectal cancer: 3.7% to 8.4% [P 5 .06]; patients
with lung cancer: 9.3% to 4.7%; patients with breast can-
cer: 3.5% to 4.3%; and patients with prostate cancer:
3.1% to 5.1%).
More participants reported having auditory impair-
ment compared with visual impairment. However, the
percentage of participants reporting hearing impairment
was not statistically significant for any group between
baseline and follow-up (control group: 12.1% to 13.7%;
patients with colorectal cancer: 11.6% to 15.8%; patients
with lung cancer: 15.1% to 15.1%; patients with breast
cancer: 5.9% to 7.4%; and patients with prostate cancer:
13.6% to 12.6%).
Does Cancer Exacerbate Preexisting Health
Conditions?
Severity of arthritis pain
Arthritis pain increased slightly over time; however, no
significant differences existed with regard to the exacerba-
tion of arthritis symptoms of the hand or the hip between
cases and controls (omnibus test P 5 .09).
Severity of neuropathy in feet
No statistically significant differences were found to exist
with regard to the development or exacerbation of neu-
ropathy in the feet between cases and controls from base-
line to follow-up (P 5 .47).
DISCUSSION
Findings from this population-based, prospective study
suggest that aging is responsible for certain conditions,
whereas both cancer and aging appear to be responsible
for other conditions and aspects of functioning. Older
adult cancer survivors experienced a greater decline in

 physical functioning over time compared with those with-
out a history of cancer, especially survivors of lung, colo-
rectal, and breast cancer. Declines in physical health in the
current analysis were slightly less pronounced than those
found by Reeve et al when also using the SEER-MHOS
data set13 that included patients with stage IV disease.
Excluding stage IV cases in the current study avoided con-
founding changes in physical functioning with those that
commonly occur at the end of life. The findings of the
current study underscore the need for oncology rehabilita-
tion or prehabilitation in these curable patients.18
Cancer also increased the risk of specific health issues
above and beyond normal aging over time. Cancer cases
had greater declines in overall ADLs compared with con-
trols over time, which is consistent with prior cross-
sectional data.4,8 However, this finding contradicts prior
results of the Duke Established Populations for Epide-
miologic Studies of the Elderly study, which suggested
that, after controlling for comorbidities, the difference in
ADLs limitations for those with and without cancer is at-
tenuated.9 The longitudinal nature of this SEER-MHOS
analysis, in combination with propensity score matching
of cases with controls on numerous chronic conditions
and sociodemographic variables, suggests that, among
older adults, having cancer is associated with greater limi-
tations in ADLs.
Cancer-specific differences in limitations of ADLs also
were found. Patients with lung cancer were found to have
significantly more pronounced deficits over time compared
with controls in multiple domains (bathing, dressing, eat-
ing, and getting in and out of chairs), although this may be
driven by the inability of the current study to identify and
exclude patients with stage IIIB disease, who have a poor
prognosis. Declines in the ability to dress one’s self occurred
for patients with colorectal cancer, whereas individuals with
breast and prostate cancer did not appear to differ signifi-
cantly from controls with regard to any limitations in
ADLs. Urinary incontinence was relatively common for all
individuals regardless of cancer history (25%), and did not
appear to change over time for most groups. Only patients
with prostate cancer were found to have a greater incidence
of urinary incontinence compared with controls in this sam-
ple, a finding that contradicts prior work4 suggesting that
cancer survivors in general experience greater levels of uri-
nary incontinence compared with those without a cancer
history. It is possible that incontinence issues for other
patients with cancer may not become present until they are
further out from diagnosis or the general cancer finding
may have been driven by patients with prostate cancer in
prior studies.
Cancer cases in general had an increased risk of
MDD compared with controls; however, only patients
with colorectal and prostate cancers were found to have an
elevated risk. These findings are consistent with data from
the Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey, which sug-
gested that cancer cases, particularly patients with colo-
rectal cancer, reported having higher rates of depression
compared with non-cancer controls.4 Health care pro-
viders should consider screening older survivors of colo-
rectal and prostate cancer for MDD so that referrals to
appropriate psychological support services can be made.
The development of conditions examined in the cur-
rent study, including arthritis and vision and/or hearing
impairment, is mostly related to aging rather than cancer.

 For cases and controls, there was a similar and modest
increase in the number of newly diagnosed arthritis cases
and in the pain associated with arthritis over time. The
majority of individuals in the current study sample experi-
enced at least 1 age-related condition such as arthritis and
sensory impairment, which further emphasizes the impor-
tance of all health professionals caring for an aging popu-
lation to be proficient in the management of these basic
age-associated conditions.
Sensory impairment and neuropathy in the feet did
not change over time in the current study sample, contrary
to prior studies that demonstrated a higher rate of hearing
impairment among older adults with a cancer history
compared with those without a cancer history.4 These
conditions may not be observed until years after a cancer
experience as a late effect, rather than within the 2-year
follow-up that was measured herein. This may be consist-
ent with the accelerated aging hypothesis, namely that
cancer accelerates the aging process but it takes >2 years
to observe this in the development and exacerbation of
age-related conditions such as arthritis and frailty pro-
posed from studies of childhood cancer survivors.19-21
Additional prospective studies are needed with longer
follow-up times among adult cancer survivors to examine
this phenomenon among older adults.
The current study has several limitations, many of
which have been covered elsewhere.13 The Medicare pop-
ulation included in the SEER-MHOS data set is healthier
than average Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries,22
which may underestimate the effects of cancer on more
vulnerable older patients. The majority of the data were
self-reported, and we were unable to link them to cancer
treatment data. We did not control for the variability in
time since diagnosis within cancer groups because all cases
were within 2 years of their diagnosis. We were unable to
identify and exclude patients with stage IIIB lung cancer,
who commonly receive only palliative care. Therefore,
there may be a small number of lung cancer cases with a
poorer prognosis than other cancer types. The specific
treatment received may explain some of the findings but
we were unable to explore them in this analysis. Finally,
the analytic data set for the current study was designed to
include only recent survivors, which precluded the exami-
nation of late effects.
The current prospective analysis using a control
group that was propensity score matched to cancer cases
enabled us to tease apart the effects of cancer and aging,
controlling for comorbidities, in a novel way. The find-
ings suggest that cancer is a stronger driver for declines in
physical functioning above and beyond aging alone. This
is likely due in some part to decreased physical activity
and the stress of the cancer experience. Decreased physical
functioning among older patients with cancer is an impor-
tant finding for clinicians because it is also actionable.
Health care providers need to recommend interventions,
such as home-based diet and exercise, for preserving phys-
ical function to limit the declines among older patients
with cancer.23 Furthermore, health care providers need to
improve the coordination of care so that patients and fam-
ilies are prepared for the changes in functioning levels.
Future prospective studies that examine the trajectory of
physical decline in younger verses older survivors over a
longer period of time with multiple time points further
out from diagnosis are needed to disentangle the effects of
cancer and aging.
