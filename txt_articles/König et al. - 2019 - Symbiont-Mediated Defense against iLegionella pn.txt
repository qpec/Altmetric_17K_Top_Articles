ABSTRACT
Legionella pneumophila is an important opportunistic pathogen for
which environmental reservoirs are crucial for the infection of humans. In the en-
vironment, free-living amoebae represent key hosts providing nutrients and shel-
ter for highly efficient intracellular proliferation of L. pneumophila, which eventu-
ally leads to lysis of the protist. However, the significance of other bacterial
players for L. pneumophila ecology is poorly understood. In this study, we used a
ubiquitous amoeba and bacterial endosymbiont to investigate the impact of this
common association on L. pneumophila infection. We demonstrate that L. pneumo-
phila proliferation was severely suppressed in Acanthamoeba castellanii harboring
the chlamydial symbiont Protochlamydia amoebophila. The amoebae survived the in-
fection and were able to resume growth. Different environmental amoeba isolates
containing the symbiont were equally well protected as different L. pneumophila iso-
lates were diminished, suggesting ecological relevance of this symbiont-mediated
defense. Furthermore, protection was not mediated by impaired L. pneumophila up-
take. Instead, we observed reduced virulence of L. pneumophila released from
symbiont-containing amoebae. Pronounced gene expression changes in the pres-
ence of the symbiont indicate that interference with the transition to the transmis-
sive phase impedes the L. pneumophila infection. Finally, our data show that the de-
fensive response of amoebae harboring P. amoebophila leaves the amoebae with
superior fitness reminiscent of immunological memory. Given that mutualistic associ-
ations between bacteria and amoebae are widely distributed, P. amoebophila and
potentially other amoeba endosymbionts could be key in shaping environmental
survival, abundance, and virulence of this important pathogen, thereby affecting the
frequency of human infection.
IMPORTANCE Bacterial pathogens are generally investigated in the context of dis-
ease. To prevent outbreaks, it is essential to understand their lifestyle and interac-
tions with other microbes in their natural environment. Legionella pneumophila is an
important human respiratory pathogen that survives and multiplies in biofilms or in-
tracellularly within protists, such as amoebae. Importantly, transmission to humans
occurs from these environmental sources. Legionella infection generally leads to
rapid host cell lysis. It was therefore surprising to observe that amoebae, including
fresh environmental isolates, were well protected during Legionella infection when
the bacterial symbiont Protochlamydia amoebophila was also present. Legionella was
not prevented from invading amoebae but was impeded in its ability to develop
fully virulent progeny and were ultimately cleared in the presence of the symbiont.
This study highlights how ecology and virulence of an important human pathogen
is affected by a defensive amoeba symbiont, with possibly major consequences for
public health.

ree-living amoebae like Acanthamoeba are ubiquitous in soil and water environ-
ments, in which they prey on bacteria, thereby controlling bacterial populations
and enhancing nutrient recycling (1, 2). Importantly, they are commonly found in
anthropogenic water systems such as drinking and industrial water, where they graze
on biofilms and interact with a diverse microbial community (3–6). Apart from bacteria
as a food source, free-living amoebae are commonly associated with facultative or
obligate intracellular bacteria that survive phagocytosis. These microbes either tran-
siently infect amoebae, exploit their host for multiplication, and finally lyse them (acting
as amoeba pathogens), or they establish long-term stable associations as they are
strictly dependent on amoebae as hosts for intracellular replication (amoeba endosym-
bionts) (7–11). When conditions turn unfavorable, acanthamoebae differentiate from
the vegetative trophozoite stage to a highly resistant cyst form (2). Several bacterial
pathogens and endosymbionts have been reported to survive encystment, facilitating
dispersal and protection from adverse conditions (7, 12–18).
Amoeba pathogens are frequently also human pathogens (10), the prime example
being the facultative intracellular bacterium Legionella pneumophila, an important
cause of community- and hospital-acquired pneumonia termed Legionnaires’disease
(19). The intracellular life cycle of L. pneumophila is strikingly similar between amoebae
and mammalian macrophages: host cell-specific attachment is followed by uptake via
“coiling phagocytosis” and a partly conserved activation of signaling pathways. They
evade the endocytic pathway, delay vacuole acidification, remodel the phagosome to
a Legionella-containing vacuole (LCV), and modulate host cellular processes, thereby
allowing efficient intravacuolar replication. During late stages of infection, L. pneumo-
phila transitions into the virulent, transmissive stage, escapes into the host cytosol, and
exits the host cell by lysis (20–23).
In the environment, L. pneumophila is thought to most efficiently replicate within
free-living amoebae, leading to the release of highly virulent bacteria primed for the
infection of humans (21, 24). Consistent with this, L. pneumophila was found to cooccur
with free-living amoebae in various aquatic environments (5, 10, 25, 26). Within cysts,
amoebae also grant protection from harsh environmental conditions, and they facilitate
resuscitation of viable but nonculturable L. pneumophila (12, 21, 27). Because the main
route of transmission of L. pneumophila to humans is from the environment, outbreaks
might be controlled by targeting free-living amoebae instead of L. pneumophila directly
(28, 29).
Bacterial endosymbionts of acanthamoebae are diverse and widespread, and in
particular, endosymbionts related to the human pathogen Chlamydia trachomatis are
frequently found in Acanthamoeba isolates (7, 10, 13, 25, 30–36). Among these envi-
ronmental chlamydiae, Protochlamydia amoebophila has been studied to some extent
(37–41). Originally detected as symbionts in an Acanthamoeba isolate from soil (7, 13),
these bacteria were shown to thrive within a range of different Acanthamoeba strains
(42). Like the human pathogens, P. amoebophila follows a characteristic developmental
cycle (30, 41), and this obligate intracellular lifestyle is believed to be several hundred
million years old (43). Other Acanthamoeba endosymbionts closely related to P. amoe-
bophila have been found (25, 33, 35, 36, 44), and rRNA gene sequences assigned to the
same chlamydial family (Parachlamydiaceae) have been detected in diverse environ-
ments (45), suggesting that, like Acanthamoeba hosts, Protochlamydia symbionts are
ubiquitous.
Despite sharing the same host, the interaction between amoeba pathogens and
symbionts has rarely been investigated. In particular, the impact of bacterial symbionts
on the environmental niche of L. pneumophila is largely unclear. Recent findings,
however, indicate that amoebae harboring a Neochlamydia species endosymbiont are
more resistant to infection with L. pneumophila (46, 47). Here, we explored the effect of

 P. amoebophila endosymbionts on various amoeba hosts in the face of L. pneumophila
infection. Our results demonstrate that (long-term) laboratory-maintained as well as
freshly isolated environmental Acanthamoeba strains survive infection either with
laboratory or environmental L. pneumophila strains in the presence of P. amoebophila.
We provide evidence that this symbiont-mediated defense is caused by interference
with normal L. pneumophila development. Together, these findings identify bacterial
endosymbionts of amoebae as an important factor in the ecology of L. pneumophila,
with a fundamental impact on environmental survival and transmission of L. pneumo-
phila to humans.
RESULTS
Amoeba survival of L. pneumophila infection in the presence of chlamydial
symbionts. To assess the impact of chlamydial endosymbionts on L. pneumophila
infection of amoebae, we first established genetically identical (isogenic) A. castellanii
Neff cultures with and without P. amoebophila as the symbiont. We next evaluated the
effect of the symbiont on the growth rate of its host. P. amoebophila remains stably
associated with its acanthamoeba host and does not cause lysis, yet the symbiont slows
down amoeba growth irrespective of the incubation temperature (see Fig. S1A in the
supplemental material). Thus, harboring the symbiont per se does not increase amoeba
fitness in terms of reproductive success, but P. amoebophila spreads efficiently through
uninfected amoeba populations (Fig. S1B).
We next challenged A. castellanii Neff with and without symbionts with two different
Legionella pneumophila strains (L. pneumophila Paris and Lp02-T), both of which orig-
inate from outbreaks of Legionnaires’disease (48, 49). Most notably, irrespective of the
L. pneumophila strain, multiplicity of infection (MOI), incubation time, and temperature,
harboring the symbiont always proved to result in a decreased L. pneumophila load
compared to that of the symbiont-free control (Table S1). The impact of the symbiont
is demonstrated by both a significantly lower proportion of (highly) infected amoebae
as well as lower L. pneumophila cell numbers at either 1 or 5 weeks postinfection (wpi)
observed in ten different experimental setups (Fig. 1A and B and Table S1 and Fig. S2A),
even though L. pneumophila was able to replicate at the beginning of the experiment
when symbionts were present (Fig. S2B and S3). Of note, L. pneumophila was observed
within amoeba cells (trophozoites) as early as 2 h postinfection (hpi), and L.
pneumophila-containing vacuoles and P. amoebophila inclusions remained well sepa-
rated during coinfection (Fig. S3).
Only when the symbionts were present did amoebae fully recover from the L.
pneumophila infection after an incubation time of 5 weeks, documented by an increase
in amoeba numbers that was similar to those of an unchallenged control, as shown for
L. pneumophila Lp02-T (Fig. 1C and D and Table S1). Strikingly, at 5 wpi L. pneumophila
Paris could not be detected in recovered amoebae, either by fluorescent in situ
hybridization (FISH) or PCR, whereas symbiont-free amoebae were lysed or infected
with L. pneumophila at this stage (Fig. 1B, E, and F). We noted that the L. pneumophila
strain used as well as MOI and incubation temperature likely affect the degree of
amoeba recovery: L. pneumophila Paris had a stronger negative effect on amoebae than
Lp02-T under the same conditions (MOI of 20, 30°
C); amoebae infected with Lp02-T
over 5 weeks only fully recovered at 30°
C but not 20°
C, and at 1 week postinfection
different L. pneumophila Paris MOIs affected amoeba numbers to various degrees (Table
S1 and Fig. S5A). Of note, the chlamydial symbionts remained present throughout the
experiment at similar levels under all conditions (Fig. 1E and F).
Taken together, a commonly used laboratory strain of free-living amoebae carrying
the chlamydial symbiont P. amoebophila is resilient to infection with L. pneumophila, a
human pathogen and amoeba parasite that typically exploits and lyses its host cells.
Consequently, the symbionts confer direct or indirect protection that leads to reduced
pathogen levels. Pathogen reduction sets in early during Legionella infection and may
ultimately be responsible for amoeba recovery.

 Symbiont-mediated protection in freshly isolated environmental amoeba and
L. pneumophila isolates. Long-term axenic culture of Acanthamoeba isolates eventu-
ally leads to adaptation and altered traits, such as decreased temperature tolerance and
reduced ability to encyst (50, 51). To account for this bias, we explored the relevance
of our findings for amoeba freshly recovered from environmental samples. Two Acan-
thamoeba isolates (designated ML and 2HH), both belonging to the same sequence
type (T4) as A. castellanii Neff, were first infected with P. amoebophila; once continuous
symbiont-containing amoeba cultures were established, they were challenged with L.
pneumophila. In addition to L. pneumophila strains Paris and Lp02-T, we also included
two freshly obtained environmental L. pneumophila isolates (strains 3626/10 and 3621).
As observed for the amoeba laboratory strain, L. pneumophila numbers were
reduced at the end of each experiment with environmental amoeba that contained P.
amoebophila compared with those of the symbiont-free control (Table S1). Importantly,
when the symbiont was present, both recent amoeba isolates could be completely
cured from L. pneumophila Lp02-T infection 5 wpi at 20°
C (Fig. 2 and Fig. S4 and S5B);
likewise, both recent L. pneumophila strains were cleared from symbiont-harboring
Acanthamoeba sp. strain ML (Fig. 2 and Table S1). Amoeba recovery, measured as
amoeba net growth, was again observed only at 5 wpi (Table S1); the amoeba isolate
Acanthamoeba sp. strain ML harboring the symbiont was even able to grow signifi-
cantly better at both 20°
C and 30°
C (Fig. S5B). In contrast to the amoeba laboratory
strain, however, symbiont-free amoeba numbers remained unchanged and even in-
creased in one instance 5 weeks after L. pneumophila infection (Table S1). The differ-
ences in the extent of L. pneumophila inhibition and amoeba recovery observed at two

pneumophila Lp02-T load in the absence (�) and presence (�) of P. amoebophila (Pam) at 5 weeks postinfection (wpi) was measured as the proportion of
amoebae containing L. pneumophila FISH signals (infected), the proportion of amoebae containing �5 L. pneumophila signals (high), and the proportion of
amoebae containing only 1 to 5 L. pneumophila signals (low). In addition, growth of Lp02-T was assessed by determining CFU per ml at 5 wpi. The difference
between �Pam and �Pam was statistically significant in comparisons of low and high infection levels (*, P � 0.05 by unpaired t test) and CFU/ml (*, P � 0.001
by unpaired t test). (B) L. pneumophila Paris infection levels were also determined via FISH, but here the course of infection over 5 weeks is shown because the
endpoints were 0% and 100% infected amoebae. Two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) combined with Tukey’
s test was applied to compare the two curves,
and significantly different time points are indicated (box marked by an asterisk, P � 0.001). (C and D) Amoeba growth at 5 weeks after L. pneumophila infection
is expressed as the difference between start and endpoint amoeba numbers. In the case of strain Lp02-T (C), symbiont-free and symbiont-containing amoebae
not infected with L. pneumophila (�Lpn) served as additional controls. Lowercase letters denote significantly distinct statistical groups (P � 0.01 by one-way

 incubation temperatures and between environmental amoeba isolates and the labo-
ratory strain indicate that host and temperature contribute to the efficiency of
symbiont-mediated inhibition of L. pneumophila.
Thus, in the face of infection with L. pneumophila, the presence of the symbiont
P. amoebophila also provides an advantage for two environmental amoeba strains,
even though Acanthamoeba sp. strain ML by itself is less susceptible to L pneumo-
phila under the conditions applied in this study. Notably, symbionts also protected
amoebae against two environmental L. pneumophila isolates. These findings indi-
cate that symbiont-mediated protection plays a role in the natural environment.
Altogether, our results suggest that while the extent of resistance against L. pneu-
mophila is likely influenced by the host strain, infectious load (MOI), and temperature,
protection is provided if amoebae can sustain the chlamydial symbiont. Of note, we
have never observed clearance of L. pneumophila in the absence of the symbiont.
Protection therefore strictly relies on the presence of the chlamydial symbiont.
Improved fitness of amoebae that recovered from L. pneumophila infection. We
next tested whether the fully recovered, L. pneumophila-cleared amoeba isolate from
the previous infection experiment (Acanthamoeba sp. strain ML) was altered in terms of
L. pneumophila susceptibility and amoeba growth when again exposed to the patho-
gen. We observed that L. pneumophila Lp02-T growth was strongly inhibited in
symbiont-harboring amoebae independent of whether the amoebae were not exposed
to L. pneumophila before (naive) or have recovered from a previous L. pneumophila
infection (Fig. 3). However, consistent with our observations for A. castellanii Neff
(Fig. S2B and S3), L. pneumophila cell numbers increased initially within naive symbiont-
containing amoebae at 48 hpi. In contrast, in recovered amoebae L. pneumophila
numbers decreased continuously (Fig. 3). This enhanced inhibition of pathogen growth
in recovered amoebae entailed a remarkably increased growth compared to that of
naive amoebae (Fig. 3). Consequently, the first exposure to the amoeba pathogen
endowed the symbiont-harboring amoeba isolate with the capacity to more efficiently
restrict L. pneumophila proliferation, promoting superior amoeba growth compared to
that of naive amoebae.
FIG 2
Environmental amoeba isolates harboring the symbiont P. amoebophila eliminate different L. pneumophila strains. FISH
combined with DAPI staining (blue) was performed at 5 weeks after L. pneumophila infection (MOI of 20, 20°
C). Amoeba and L.
pneumophila strains used are indicated on the top of each set of images, in which the first row shows infections without the symbiont
(�Pam) and the second row with the symbiont (�Pam). Initial infection with L. pneumophila was determined at 2 hpi (diamond
symbols in Fig. 4). FISH probes specifically targeted L. pneumophila (LEGPNE1, magenta) and the chlamydial symbiont (Chls-523,
green). Amoeba outlines are indicated by white dotted lines. Scale bars, 10 �m.

 Symbiont-mediated defense is not caused by reduced host cell invasion. The
reduced number of L. pneumophila cells in symbiont-containing amoebae at the end of
an infection experiment could be the consequence of impaired host cell invasion. While
the mode of host cell entry of the P. amoebophila symbiont is still unknown, L.
pneumophila uptake is facilitated by receptor-mediated endocytosis (52). Thus, either
competition for or symbiont-stimulated downregulation of L. pneumophila receptors
could decrease the rate of host cell invasion.
To explore whether the presence of the symbiont within amoebae affects initial
susceptibility of amoebae to L. pneumophila, we determined the number of L. pneu-
mophila cells that could successfully infect amoebae, as well as the relative number of
amoebae that were infected by L. pneumophila shortly after infection. Tested in
numerous experiments (using different amoeba and L. pneumophila strains), we could
not detect any significant differences in susceptibility, as amoebae both with and
without the symbiont were invaded by comparable numbers of L. pneumophila (CFU/
amoeba) and at similar frequency (percent infected amoebae) (Fig. 4A). Notably, the
fully recovered, symbiont-harboring amoeba isolate Acanthamoeba sp. strain ML also
did not show a significantly decreased susceptibility to reinfection with L. pneumophila
Lp02-T compared with that of the naive counterparts (Fig. 4A, upper, orange dia-
monds). FISH performed at 2 hpi independently confirmed this similar invasion effi-
ciency of two L. pneumophila strains (Fig. S3).
To further demonstrate that there is no uptake inhibition and/or receptor compe-
tition between P. amoebophila and L. pneumophila, we exploited the fact that the
chlamydial symbionts are also transmitted horizontally and therefore also occur outside
the host cell. If the bacteria used similar routes for host cell entry, extracellular
symbionts in excess over L. pneumophila levels could hinder their uptake, eventually
causing a delay in invasion by L. pneumophila. We tested this hypothesis by infecting
symbiont-free A. castellanii Neff with different mixtures of viable or heat-inactivated P.
amoebophila and infectious L. pneumophila Lp02-T. L. pneumophila infection levels at 2
hpi were then compared to those of controls in which only L. pneumophila was added.
When the symbiont and L. pneumophila were approximately equally abundant, or when
the symbiont was slightly more abundant than L. pneumophila (symbiont/pathogen
ratio of 6:1), the symbionts did not affect the uptake of L. pneumophila (Fig. 4B).
Unexpectedly, when the symbiont was added in greater excess over L. pneumophila
(symbiont/pathogen ratio of 67:1), the proportion of L. pneumophila-infected amoebae
FIG 3 Increased fitness of a recovered amoeba isolate in the face of L. pneumophila Lp02-T infection. Acanthamoeba sp.
strain ML previously not exposed to L. pneumophila Lp02-T (Lpn; amoebae termed naive) or exposed but cleared from L.
pneumophila (termed recovered) were infected with L. pneumophila Lp02-T (MOI of 20, 20°
C). Gentamicin treatment was
performed to kill extracellular bacteria, and L. pneumophila numbers (left) and net amoeba growth (right) were deter-
mined, starting at 2 hpi. The presence and absence of endosymbionts are indicated by �Pam and �Pam, respectively.
Error bars show standard deviations from three biological replicates. In total, L. pneumophila growth is only significantly
different between symbiont-free amoebae and both conditions with the symbiont present (*, P � 0.05 by one-way ANOVA
and Tukey’
s test). However, L. pneumophila numbers at 48 hpi also significantly vary between recovered and naive
amoebae harboring the symbiont (*, P � 0.01 by unpaired t test). Amoeba growth is significantly different between
recovered amoebae (�Pam) and naive amoebae with and without symbionts at the last two time points (*, P � 0.001 by
two-way ANOVA and Tukey’
s test).

 was twice as high as that of the control without the symbiont (Fig. 4B). The addition of
heat-inactivated symbionts had a similar effect on L. pneumophila uptake (Fig. 4B).
Altogether, neither symbionts present within the amoebae nor extracellular symbi-
onts hampered invasion of amoebae by L. pneumophila. Instead, amoebae harboring
symbionts were as susceptible to infection by the pathogen as symbiont-free amoebae.
Moreover, the presence of a large number of extracellular symbionts appeared to
stimulate uptake of L. pneumophila (independent from symbiont viability). The reduced
L. pneumophila load we observed at 1 week postinfection (Fig. S2 and S3 and Table S1)
is therefore not a result of constrained L. pneumophila uptake during initial infection
FIG 4 The symbiont P. amoebophila does not affect L. pneumophila uptake and host cell invasion. (A) To
assess susceptibility of amoebae to L. pneumophila infection, we measured the number of viable L.
pneumophila cells per amoeba cell (upper) and percentage of L. pneumophila-infected amoebae (lower),
both at 2 hpi. CFU/amoeba were determined not only for naive amoebae with (�Pam) and without the
symbiont (�Pam) but also for fully recovered symbiont-harboring amoebae (�Pam-recov.). Color groups
denote separate experiments, with each data point representing a biological replicate. Circles show
results from experiments using A. castellanii Neff, whereas experiments conducted with Acanthamoeba
sp. strain ML are represented by diamonds. Data points filled with color were obtained using L.
pneumophila Paris, and data points with black dots were obtained using L. pneumophila Lp02-T.
Horizontal solid lines indicate medians, taking into account all data points. Dotted lines show medians
only considering the infections with symbionts from Fig. 3 (pink and orange diamond shapes). Error bars
denote interquartile ranges. No individual experiment yielded a statistically significant difference be-
tween the presence and absence of the symbiont or between naive and recovered amoebae (P � 0.05
by unpaired t test). (B) The role of extracellularly present symbionts in invasion by L. pneumophila was
assessed by adding viable or heat-inactivated (hi) P. amoebophila (Pam) to uninfected A. castellanii Neff
together with L. pneumophila Lp02-T (Lpn) but at different ratios. At 2 hpi, L. pneumophila infection levels
were determined and compared to the respective levels for L. pneumophila only (control). A fold
difference around 1 indicates that L. pneumophila infection levels were similar between treatment (viable
or heat-inactivated P. amoebophila) and the control. The experiment was conducted in three biological
replicates. Error bars indicate the 95% confidence intervals of a ratio of two means. Infections of A.
castellanii Neff with L. pneumophila Lp02-T were carried out at 30°

 stages. Also, reduced amoeba-to-amoeba transmission of L. pneumophila by extracel-
lular symbionts potentially blocking uptake can be ruled out as a factor contributing to
the observed symbiont-mediated protection. Thus, we postulate that the mechanism
responsible for symbiont-mediated defense involves inhibiting intra-amoeba develop-
ment of L. pneumophila, which ultimately could impair transmission of this pathogen.
Decreased infectivity of L. pneumophila released from symbiont-harboring
amoebae. If transmission of L. pneumophila was indeed impaired by an intra-amoeba,
endosymbiont-dependent inhibition of L. pneumophila development, we would expect
to observe a negative effect on replication, development, and/or release of L. pneu-
mophila from symbiont-containing amoebae. To test this hypothesis, we quantified L.
pneumophila Paris released from Acanthamoeba sp. strain ML into the supernatant at
late infection stages and also determined their infectivity. We chose 96 hpi for collect-
ing the supernatants, because light microscopic inspection of infected cultures indi-
cated massive release of L. pneumophila from symbiont-free amoebae at this time
point. By plating the supernatants, we indeed recorded a marked (4-fold) decrease in
the number of L. pneumophila organisms released in the presence of the symbiont at
this time point during infection (Fig. 5A), a ratio that could be confirmed when counting
L. pneumophila via filtration and 4=,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) staining (data
not shown). Based on L. pneumophila numbers determined by DAPI staining, symbiont-
free amoebae were subsequently infected with equal numbers of L. pneumophila
released from symbiont-containing and symbiont-free amoebae. Strikingly, the propor-
tion of infected amoebae at 2 hpi was significantly lower when L. pneumophila
originated from symbiont-harboring amoebae than from symbiont-free amoebae
(Fig. 5B). This pronounced difference in infectivity indicates that L. pneumophila re-
leased from symbiont-harboring amoebae is less virulent than L. pneumophila released
from symbiont-free amoebae.
Thus, the presence of the P. amoebophila symbiont either slows down or blocks the
progression of the intracellular life cycle of L. pneumophila, resulting in a reduction of
pathogen progeny. Together with the observed decrease of infectivity, these two
effects may ultimately lead to elimination of L. pneumophila from the host amoebae
population containing P. amoebophila, as observed in our experiments.

hpi, the supernatants containing the released L. pneumophila cells were harvested, and L. pneumophila
cells were counted (A) and used to infect symbiont-free amoebae at an MOI of 30 (�Pam) or 23 (�Pam)
(B). Both the CFU/ml released at 96 hpi and the percentage of amoebae at 2 hpi infected with L.
pneumophila (DAPI counts) were significantly different from those of the control, even when normalized
for the slight difference of a factor of 1.3 in MOI (*, P � 0.001 by unpaired t test). Error bars indicate
standard deviations, and horizontal lines in panel B show the means from three biological replicates.

 L. pneumophila, we analyzed the gene expression dynamics of both bacteria during
single infection or coinfection. We determined gene expression levels by RNA sequenc-
ing (RNA-Seq) at 24 hpi and 96 hpi, corresponding to the replicative and transmissive
phase, respectively, of L. pneumophila Paris in symbiont-free as well as in symbiont-
containing A. castellanii Neff. At the later time point, intracellular bacteria as well as
legionellae released from amoeba host cells were analyzed separately. Transcripts were
detected for 82 to 98% of all genes for both L. pneumophila and P. amoebophila
(Table S2). Differential gene expression analysis showed that up to 1,079 genes were
significantly up- or downregulated between time points and depending on the pres-
ence/absence of the symbiont or pathogen (corresponding to 66% of all expressed
genes) (Fig. S6 and Data set S1). To understand these pronounced changes, we
determined functional categories and processes significantly overrepresented among
the set of differentially expressed genes (Fig. S6).
At 24 hpi and in the presence of L. pneumophila, P. amoebophila upregulated a large
number of stress response-related genes and genes encoding type 3 secretion system
(T3SS) components and putative effector proteins. Conversely, processes such as
translation, transcription, and amino acid and fatty acid metabolism were downregu-
lated at this time point. At 96 hpi, the genes involved in metabolism were upregulated
again and were comparable to gene expression levels observed in the absence of L.
pneumophila, whereas T3SS-related genes were downregulated. Together, this mRNA
profile suggests that at 24 hpi with L. pneumophila, the symbiont induces a general
stress response and dramatically shuts down its metabolism and replication. The
symbiont reacts to L. pneumophila infection by enhancing protein secretion, including
a range of (new) effectors, indicating that P. amoebophila first struggles to maintain its
intracellular niche and later adjusts to the changed environment by additional remod-
elling of host cellular processes. At 96 hpi the symbiont appears to have managed to
take over host cell control again, and expression of metabolic genes is back to normal,
i.e., resembles the situation without L. pneumophila.
For L. pneumophila, the presence of the symbiont did not have a strong effect
during early infection stages. Gene expression was not altered substantially at 24
hpi compared to the situation without P. amoebophila (5% differentially expressed
genes only) (Fig. S6). However, there are a number of striking differences during the
progression of the L. pneumophila life cycle. In the presence of the symbiont and
contrary to the single infection, DNA replication, respiration, and glycolytic pro-
cesses were not downregulated at 96 hpi, and genes involved in polyhydroxybu-
tyrate (PHB) synthesis were not upregulated at this time point (Fig. 6 and Fig. S6).
Similarly, while a range of regulatory genes, including the pivotal regulator csrA (53,
54), were upregulated in L. pneumophila cells released from the amoeba host, these
genes remained unchanged in the presence of the symbiont (Fig. 6). Instead, ABC
transporters, including import proteins for amino acids (the substrate for intracel-
lular growth of legionellae) (89), remain highly expressed at 96 hpi, and a pro-
nounced downregulation of genes responsible for flagellar assembly was observed
when the symbiont was present (Fig. 6 and Fig. S6). This mRNA profile indicates that
L. pneumophila infection starts normally despite the presence of the P. amoebophila
symbiont. Consistent with the findings in our infection experiments, L. pneumophila
is taken up and starts to replicate within amoeba cells (Fig. 4 and Fig. S2B and S3).
However, at 96 hpi, which typically marks the end of the infection cycle, processes
characteristic of the transmissive phase are impaired, including PHB metabolism
and flagellum synthesis (55, 56). The lack of downregulation of metabolic functions
and persistent expression of amino acid transporters indicate that L. pneumophila
is still equipped to acquire nutrients long after the initial infection. These gene
expression profiles in the presence of the symbiont are consistent with an ob-
structed transition to the transmissive phase and the release of replicative, nonin-
fectious L. pneumophila cells, as observed in our infection experiments (Fig. 5).

 DISCUSSION
Symbiont-mediated protection of amoebae. Animal-bacterium interactions are
manifold and fundamentally impact animal evolution, development, biology, and
ecology (57). Bacterial symbionts often provide nutrients to and recycle waste products
from the host organism, and some may manipulate host reproduction (58, 59). In
particular, insects also harbor bacterial symbionts that provide them with protection
against natural enemies such as parasitic wasps, pathogenic fungi, and viruses (60–62).
Symbiont-mediated defense is also an important role of complex animal microbiomes
(63) but until recently was not known to extend to protists harboring symbionts (64,
65). Our study demonstrates that (i) in the presence of the chlamydial symbiont P.
amoebophila, Acanthamoeba hosts survive infection by the amoeba parasite and
human pathogen L. pneumophila, (ii) the mode of protection in this protist host
involves failed formation of infectious transmissive L. pneumophila, and (iii) symbiont-
mediated defense is a trait of both environmental and clinical isolates of amoebae and
L. pneumophila. Together with recent findings on a related amoeba endosymbiont (46),
FIG 6
Altered L. pneumophila gene expression in the presence of the symbiont suggests impaired
transition from replicative to transmissive phase. Transcriptomes of L. pneumophila Paris infecting A.
castellanii Neff with (�Pam) and without (�Pam) the P. amoebophila symbiont at 24 h, at 96 h within
amoebae, and after host cell release (extracell) were determined by RNA-Seq (20°
C; for MOIs see Materials
and Methods). Processes and functional categories that were significantly enriched among differentially
expressed genes include flagellum biosynthesis, PHB metabolism, and genes involved in growth phase
regulation (Fig. S6). Heatmaps show log2 fold changes (logFC) of all genes that were differentially
expressed between at least one pair of conditions (false discovery rate of �0.05). A logFC below 1 (no
differential expression) is shown in white, significant downregulation is shown in blue, and significant
upregulation is shown in red. The stronger the color, the stronger the gene expression change between
two conditions. Flagellar genes are ordered by genetic locus, and the other genes are ordered by
processes. Note that fleQ, phbC-1, letS, lqsS, lqsT, rpoS, cpxA, and cpxR were not differentially expressed.

 we bring forward compelling evidence that chlamydial symbionts associated with
free-living amoebae represent mutually beneficial symbioses with the host, providing
nutrition and a sheltered environment, and with the symbionts, providing defense
against parasite infection (Fig. 7).
Modes of symbiont-mediated defense against L. pneumophila. Interestingly,
the mechanism of host protection differs for two chlamydial endosymbionts.
Whereas amoebae harboring Neochlamydia sp. strain S13 exhibit severely reduced
L. pneumophila entry caused by impaired phagocytosis (47), our data consistently
show that P. amoebophila has no effect on host cell invasion by L. pneumophila
(Fig. 4A). Instead, the presence of the symbiont likely perturbs intra-amoeba
development of the pathogen, as impaired formation of fully virulent L. pneumo-
phila Paris was indicated by two complementary experiments (Fig. 5 and 6; see also
Fig. S6 in the supplemental material). These fundamentally different protection
modes may seem surprising, as Protochlamydia and Neochlamydia both occur
naturally as symbionts in amoebae. However, they are members of two related
genera, and two important distinctions could account for their different protection
mechanisms. First, P. amoebophila resides within host-derived membranes termed
inclusions (66), whereas Neochlamydia sp. strain S13 can be found directly in the
amoeba cytoplasm (35). This different level of cellular integration likely affects
interaction with the amoeba host and may thus result in a fundamentally different
host response to L. pneumophila infection. Second, different sets of chlamydial
effector proteins delivered via type 2 and type 3 secretion systems could differen-
tially modulate protection, as a large number of putatively secreted proteins unique
for each symbiont has been identified (40, 46).
Interference with the transition of L. pneumophila to the transmissive form.
Collectively, our data indicate that the presence of P. amoebophila leads to reduced L.
pneumophila growth and an incomplete transition to the infectious transmissive stage.
Monitoring the course of infection by FISH and plate counts for two L. pneumophila
strains and two A. castellanii strains revealed that L. pneumophila uptake is generally not
inhibited, and that the bacteria also multiply in the presence of the symbionts (Fig. 3
FIG 7
Symbiont-mediated defense against L. pneumophila. In the absence of chlamydial endosymbionts, L. pneumophila undergoes a characteristic
intra-amoeba life cycle involving entry, replication within a Legionella-containing vacuole (LCV), transition to the transmissive form, amoeba lysis, and bacterial
escape. The transmissive form can subsequently infect other host cells (left). The present study, together with that of Maita et al. (47), demonstrates that
chlamydial endosymbionts of Acanthamoeba spp. provide the host with protection against different strains of L. pneumophila, although the modes of protection
are different. While Neochlamydia species-harboring amoebae block the uptake of L. pneumophila (right) (47), P. amoebophila-containing amoebae interfere with
the intracellular L. pneumophila life cycle, resulting in a significantly reduced number of released bacteria that are less virulent (center) (this study). Steps 3 and
4 in the Neochlamydia sp. strain S13 model have not been demonstrated but would be expected to be a consequence of impaired L. pneumophila uptake (in
parentheses). Note that the two types of endosymbionts differ in that P. amoebophila is enclosed within an inclusion membrane, whereas Neochlamydia sp.
strain S13 is found directly in the host cytoplasm. Replicative-phase L. pneumophila is shown in dark violet, whereas transmissive forms are depicted in pink.

 and 4 and Fig. S2 and S3). However, given the reduced overall number of viable L.
pneumophila organisms 1 week postinfection, as well as the lower number of released
bacteria 4 days postinfection than that of the symbiont-free control, L. pneumophila
growth is either inhibited after a few rounds of replication or generally slowed down
under the influence of the symbionts. This inhibition or delay of L. pneumophila
development subsequently interferes with the pathogen’
s conversion from the repli-
cative to the transmissive stage (67), as substantial differences in gene expression
indicate the lack of features required at the transmissive stage, including storage
compound synthesis and a complete flagellar apparatus (Fig. 6). As a consequence,
fewer and less infectious L. pneumophila cells are released from amoebae with symbi-
onts (Fig. 5). Taking these findings together, L. pneumophila infecting P. amoebophila-
harboring amoebae are targeted at an intracellular stage at which both growth and
completion of the life cycle are impaired.
Towards a molecular mechanism. The exact molecular mechanism by which L.
pneumophila infection is controlled in the presence of the chlamydial endosymbionts
remains unknown for both P. amoebophila and Neochlamydia sp. strain S13 (47). In this
study, we observed inhibition of L. pneumophila independent of the strain used; thus,
the protection mechanism conferred by P. amoebophila is likely targeted against a
conserved L. pneumophila feature. Irrespective of the specific target, different scenarios,
or a mixture thereof, could explain the intracellular inhibition of L. pneumophila.
Some defensive microbes protect their host by interference competition, in which a
toxin produced by the symbiont directly targets the parasite, pathogen, or predator (61,
65). The P. amoebophila genome does indeed encode proteins with classical polymor-
phic toxin domains, some of which are involved in interbacterial competition (68). A
number of additional uncharacterized putative effector proteins secreted by the T3SS
are also upregulated in the presence of L. pneumophila (Fig. S6). It is currently unclear,
however, whether any of those have the potential to directly target and interfere with
L. pneumophila development.
Alternatively, an indirect mode of defense could involve host immunity factors
upregulated in response to the symbiont. Stimulated antimicrobial responses, some of
which have been identified in the A. castellanii Neff genome (20, 69), could in turn act
against L. pneumophila. For example, antimicrobial peptides are well-established me-
diators of innate immunity in eukaryotes that are known to be produced in response
to symbionts (70). Autophagy can also act in pathogen clearance (71). Host immune
mediation is well characterized for the endosymbiont Wolbachia, which induces a
reactive oxygen species-dependent immune pathway that inhibits dengue virus pro-
liferation in mosquito hosts (65, 72). Antimicrobial factors stimulated by P. amoebophila
may be specific for L. pneumophila. Alternatively, the symbiont may protect itself
against a general host antibacterial activity. The pronounced stress response of P.
amoebophila upon L. pneumophila infection and the concomitant increased T3SS
activity by the symbiont (including upregulation of both structural genes encoding the
T3SS apparatus as well as novel putative effector proteins with eukaryotic-like domains)
suggest that symbiont-induced modulation of host cellular pathways contributes to
restricting growth and differentiation of L. pneumophila in amoeba. Because inhibition
of L. pneumophila was recorded for three different Acanthamoeba host strains, con-
served amoeba factors would play a role in this scenario.
Although each of the above-described scenarios remain plausible, we favor the
model that the anti-L. pneumophila effect involves resource competition, as nutrients
are tightly sequestered and thus may become scarce in the amoeba cytosol (73, 74). In
this scenario, the obligate chlamydial symbiont would be better adapted to scavenge
nutrients from the host than the facultative intracellular L. pneumophila and thus would
severely restrict the resources needed by the invading pathogen to proliferate and
differentiate to the infectious, transmissive form. Considering that P. amoebophila and
L. pneumophila overlap in their nutrient requirements (e.g., glucose and amino acids)
(39, 41, 89), L. pneumophila may indeed be starved for certain metabolites. Moreover,

 marked changes in the expression of transport and metabolism-related genes in both
bacteria indicate that competition for resources occurs during coinfection and contrib-
utes to L. pneumophila inhibition. In fact, it is known that L. pneumophila differentiation
and replication are governed by metabolic cues (67), and consequently a shortage or
imbalance caused by the symbiont could perturb the intra-amoeba life cycle of L.
pneumophila.
The defensive response exerts a long-lasting effect. Remarkably, past infection
with L. pneumophila Lp02-T left an imprint on an environmental amoeba isolate that
survived through symbiont-mediated protection. Like naive symbiont-harboring amoe-
bae, amoebae that fully recovered from L. pneumophila infection were not more
invasion resistant (Fig. 3 and 4A). However, fully recovered amoeba progeny did exhibit
a more potent protection, as judged by L. pneumophila growth inhibition coupled with
improved amoeba growth rate, suggesting that the previous encounter with L. pneu-
mophila led to altered traits of the symbiont-amoeba system facilitating an even more
powerful defensive response. Future studies can investigate whether the enhanced
amoeba fitness is a general consequence of amoeba recovery and whether it is due to
selection for symbiont-harboring amoebae equipped with stronger protective traits or
instead an adaptation resembling a type of immunological memory.
Conclusions. Free-living amoebae with and without endosymbionts and L. pneu-
mophila live in the same natural environments, such as biofilms in aquatic systems (3,
10). Maintaining chlamydial symbionts frequently comes at the cost of slower amoeba
growth (Fig. S1). However, our study suggests that the symbionts equip the amoebae
with an epigenetic-like defense, which provides a net fitness benefit when L. pneumo-
phila is present (75). This defense is different from intrinsic amoeba antimicrobial
defense strategies. It is both heritable and transferable, because the symbionts are
transmitted vertically and horizontally. As symbiont-free amoebae are killed by
pathogen-induced lysis, L. pneumophila represents a selective pressure expected to
shape symbiont frequencies. Conversely, our data suggest that the presence of amoeba
endosymbionts (in 25 to 100% of amoeba isolates; 13, 36) contributes to regulating
abundance and virulence of L. pneumophila in the environment. Chlamydial symbionts
of protists might be an important factor for the ecology of L. pneumophila and impact
their capacity to cause opportunistic infections of humans.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Bacteria and protist cultures. The widely used laboratory strain Acanthamoeba castellanii Neff
(ATCC 50373), with or without the endosymbiont Protochlamydia amoebophila UWE25 (ATCC PRA-7), was
maintained in cell culture flasks (Nalge Nunc International, Rochester, NY, USA) at 20°
C or 30°
C in PYG
medium (20 g/liter proteose peptone, 100 mM glucose, 2 g/liter yeast extract, 1 g/liter sodium citrate
dihydrate, 4 mM MgSO4·
7H2O, 1.32 mM Na2HPO4·
2H2O, 2.5 mM KH2PO4, 0.05 mM Fe(NH4)2(SO4)2·
6H2O;
pH 6.5). Continuous cultures (i.e., asynchronous and when containing the endosymbiont, 100% infected)
were regularly screened for contamination by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) targeting most
bacteria (probe mix of EUB338, EUB338 II, and EUB338 III; 76, 77) and DAPI staining (0.1 �g/ml in
double-distilled water for 5 min).
Acanthamoeba sp. strain ML was recently isolated from sediment sampled from the Mono Lake in
California. An axenic culture was obtained as described previously (36) and then confirmed to be
symbiont free by FISH (mix of EUB338, EUB338 II, and EUB338 III) and DAPI staining. Sequencing of the
18S rRNA gene using the JDP primer set (78) assigned this new isolate to the most commonly isolated
Acanthamoeba lineage, the T4 sequence type, which also includes A. castellanii Neff (79). Acanthamoeba
sp. strain 2HH was isolated from patients who had developed a severe keratitis and were also found to
be symbiont free and belonging to the T4 genotype (80). Both environmental isolates were infected with
P. amoebophila as described below and maintained in culture as described above for A. castellanii Neff.
Legionella pneumophila Lp02 thyA�, a serogroup 1 Philadelphia-1 strain (here named L. pneumophila
Lp02-T) that was converted back to thymidine prototrophy to enable infection of amoebae (81), and L.
pneumophila strain Paris (CIP 107629T) (87), another serogroup 1 strain, were cultivated on N-(2-
acetamido)-2-aminoethanesulfonic acid (ACES)-buffered charcoal yeast extract (CYE) plates and ACES-
buffered yeast extract (AYE) broth, both at 37°
C and supplemented with 0.4 g/liter L-cysteine and
0.135 g/liter ferric nitrate. L. pneumophila Lp02-T was additionally inoculated with 0.1 g/liter thymidine.
Broth cultures were agitated on a roller drum (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany). CYE plates were prepared
by addition of 2 g/liter charcoal and 15 g/liter agar to AYE broth. Two environmental L. pneumophila
strains, 3621 and 3626/10 (both serogroup 1), were recently isolated from an unspecified Viennese water
source and generously provided by the Austrian Agency for Health and Food Safety (AGES). They were

among all used L. pneumophila strains.
FISH. Aliquots of amoeba cultures were harvested and washed once with Page’
s amoebic saline
(0.12 g/liter NaCl, 0.004 g/liter MgSO4·
7H2O, 0.004 g/liter CaCl2·
2H2O, 0.142 g/liter Na2HPO4, 0.136 g/liter
KH2PO4). Amoeba trophozoites were allowed to attach for 30 min on microscope glass slides with
reaction wells (Marienfeld, Lauda-Königshofen, Germany) and then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for
10 min at room temperature. FISH was performed using the protocol, hybridization, and washing buffer
described elsewhere (82). Briefly, fixed cells were washed with double-distilled water, and samples were
dehydrated by incubation in increasing concentrations of ethanol (50%, 80%, and 96% for 3 min each),
hybridized with respective Cy3, Cy5 (30 ng/�l), or FLUOS-labeled (50 ng/�l) rRNA-targeted oligonucle-
otide probes in hybridization buffer (0.9 M NaCl, 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.01% [wt/vol] SDS, 25% [vol/vol]
formamide) for 1.5 h at 46°
C in a hybridization chamber, and washed with prewarmed washing buffer
(20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mM EDTA, pH 8.0, 149 mM NaCl) for 10 min at 48°
C in a water bath, followed
by a quick dip into ice-cold double-distilled water and drying using compressed air.
Transfer of P. amoebophila to fresh amoeba isolates. The supernatants of continuous A. castellanii
Neff-P. amoebophila cultures containing released symbionts were harvested, cells were collected by
centrifugation (10,620 � g, 15 min), and the suspension was filtered through 5-�m and 1.2-�m syringe
filters (Sartorius, Göttingen, Germany) to remove residual amoeba cells. To make sure the original host
was not cotransferred, the suspension was additionally freeze/thawed (�80°
C/48°
C) and subsequently
vortexed with half of the volume of glass beads (diameter, 0.75 to 1 mm; Carl Roth, Karlsruhe, Germany).
The cell debris was removed by centrifugation (150 � g, 10 min), and the supernatant was centrifuged
(10,620 � g, 10 min) to collect the bacterial cells, after which they were used to inoculate PYG medium
to check for remaining viable amoeba (control) or added to cultures of Acanthamoeba sp. strain ML and
Acanthamoeba sp. strain 2HH.
Preparation of L. pneumophila for infection. AYE medium was inoculated with respective L.
pneumophila strains, grown overnight at 37°
C on a roller drum, diluted with fresh medium to an optical
density at 600 nm (OD600) of 0.2 to 0.3, and grown to postexponential phase (OD600 of �3.5). Only
cultures exhibiting a high proportion of motile cells were used for infection. Motility was assessed
qualitatively as described previously (83). The number of viable L. pneumophila organisms added to
amoebae was determined by diluting the cultures in infection buffer (84) and subsequent plating of
dilutions on CYE plates in triplicate.
Infection experiments to assess the protection effect. One day prior to infection, cultures of
symbiont-free amoebae and amoebae containing P. amoebophila were harvested, and multiwell plates
or 25-cm2 culture flasks (Nalge Nunc) containing PYG medium were inoculated at densities allowing for
comparable cell numbers between conditions and experiments on the day of infection. Different amoeba
strains with and without symbionts were infected with different L. pneumophila strains at various
multiplicities of infection (MOIs), either at 20°
C or 30°
C (see Table S1 in the supplemental material). To
evaluate both short-term and long-term effects of exposure to L. pneumophila, infection experiments
were conducted over 5 to 7 days or 5 weeks (Table S1). At 2 hpi, cocultures were washed three times with
infection buffer to synchronize the infection, buffer was replaced with PYG medium, and cells were either
harvested to assess starting levels of amoebae and L. pneumophila (see below) or further incubated at
respective temperatures. Infections surveyed for up to 1 week continued to be harvested daily. In
long-term infections, medium was replaced weekly, either by exchanging the medium or harvesting of
cells, collection by centrifugation (6,800 � g, 5 min, room temperature), and transfer to fresh medium
(Table S1). Long-term infections were evaluated 5 wpi by quantifying amoebae and L. pneumophila
counts and, in some instances, by PCR (Table S1 and Text S1). Infection experiments were conducted in
biological triplicate. To visualize infections, FISH was performed using probes detecting L. pneumophila
(LEGPNE1) (85), chlamydiae (Chls-0523) (88), and amoebae (EUK516) (76), and images were taken using
a confocal laser scanning microscope (510 Meta; Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany; or TCS SP8; Leica, Wetzlar,
Germany) or charge-coupled device camera (AxioCam HRc; Carl Zeiss) connected to an epifluorescence
microscope (Axioplan 2 imaging; Carl Zeiss).
Entry competition experiment. Extracellular P. amoebophila organisms were freshly harvested from
continuous A. castellanii Neff-P. amoebophila cultures as described above. After filtration, bacterial cells
were collected by centrifugation (12,850 � g, 20 min, 4°
C) and resuspended in infection buffer, and a
small aliquot was counted by filtration onto polycarbonate membranes and subsequent DAPI staining as
described previously (41). Bacterial suspensions were then split into two aliquots. One aliquot was heat
inactivated for 1 h at 95°
C and served as a dead control, whereas the other, containing viable P.
amoebophila, was directly used. Symbiont-free A. castellanii Neff seeded into multiwell plates containing
PYG medium was subsequently exposed to mixtures of either viable or heat-inactivated P. amoebophila
with infectious L. pneumophila Lp02-T at three different ratios (L. pneumophila/P. amoebophila ratio, 1:0.7,
1:6, and 1:67) but keeping total numbers of bacterial cells and volumes constant. L. pneumophila without
P. amoebophila served as the positive control; numbers added to the amoebae were equal to the
numbers of L. pneumophila in the different mixtures. All treatments were conducted in biological
triplicate. Infected amoebae were incubated at 30°
C for 2 h and then harvested and fixed for FISH to
determine the fraction of L. pneumophila-infected amoebae. Results are expressed as ratios between
mean infection levels of mixtures and the control.
Quantification and infectivity of released L. pneumophila. Acanthamoeba sp. strain ML cultures
with and without symbionts growing in PYG medium at 20°
C were infected with L. pneumophila Paris
(MOI of 5) in triplicate. At 2 hpi, infections were synchronized by washing four times with infection buffer,
and aliquots were harvested to examine the percentage of infected amoebae by FISH. At 96 hpi, culture

 supernatants were harvested, filtered through 5-�m and 1.2-�m syringe filters to remove amoebae, and
subsequently plated on CYE plates to determine CFU per ml of released L. pneumophila. To assess
infectivity, replicate filtered supernatants were pooled, and cells were collected (8,300 � g, 10 min, room
temperature) and counted as described above for P. amoebophila. Based on these counts, symbiont-free
amoebae were infected in triplicate with equal numbers of released L. pneumophila cells. Supernatants
were also plated on CYE plates to determine MOIs based on the number of viable L. pneumophila cells
(L. pneumophila released from symbiont-free amoebae, MOI of 30; L. pneumophila released from
symbiont-harboring amoebae, MOI of 23). After washing four times at 2 hpi, cells were harvested and
fixed for FISH and DAPI staining, and the fraction of L. pneumophila-infected amoebae was determined.
Infection of recovered amoebae. Recovered symbiont-harboring Acanthamoeba sp. strain ML cells
that were harvested 5 weeks after infection with L. pneumophila Lp02-T were seeded into PYG-containing
multiwell plates. As a control, previously unexposed (naive) amoebae with and without the symbiont
were seeded at equal densities. When grown to confluence at 20°
C, amoebae were infected with L.
pneumophila Lp02-T at an MOI of 20. The infection was synchronized by killing extracellular L. pneumo-
phila with gentamicin (100 �g/ml) that was added 1 hpi. After an hour of incubation, gentamicin was
removed by two washing steps with PYG medium. At 2, 24, 48, and 120 hpi at 20°
C, cocultures were
harvested to quantify amoebae and L. pneumophila.
Quantification of amoebae, L. pneumophila, and L. pneumophila infection level. To determine
amoeba numbers per volume, amoebae were harvested by physically detaching amoebae from the
culture surface at the indicated time points and directly counting cells using a Neubauer counting
chamber. Amoeba growth is expressed as the difference between starting and final cell concentration
(net growth). Amoeba cell sizes were determined using FISH images and the open-source image analysis
software ImageJ (86). To monitor numbers of viable L. pneumophila, amoeba cocultures were harvested
at different times postinfection, cells were collected by centrifugation (6,800 � g, 8 min, room temper-
ature), pellets were resuspended in infection buffer, and amoebae were lysed by one freeze-thaw cycle
(�20°
C/48°
C), followed by five passages through 26-gauge injection needles (B. Braun, Melsungen,
Germany). Lysates were then plated at different dilutions on CYE plates to determine CFU/ml. Infection
levels were determined by DAPI staining combined with FISH applying the L. pneumophila-specific probe
(see above) and subsequent counting of infected relative to uninfected amoebae using an epifluores-
cence microscope. If necessary, infection levels were further classified as either low (1 to 5 bacteria/
amoeba) or high (�5 bacteria/amoeba). Infection levels are expressed as percent L. pneumophila-infected
amoebae.
Transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq). Symbiont-free as well as symbiont-containing cultures of A.
castellanii Neff amoebae were harvested 3 days before infection, and 9 � 106 amoebae per culture flask
per time point were seeded in PYG medium and incubated at 20°
C. Infectious L. pneumophila Paris cells
were prepared as described above. Cultures were infected by adding L. pneumophila directly to the flasks,
using an MOI of 5 for harvesting at 24 hpi and an MOI of 3 for harvesting at 96 hpi. Infected symbiont-free
and symbiont-containing cultures, as well as uninfected symbiont-containing cultures, were then incu-
bated for 2 h before amoebae were washed four times with infection buffer. PYG medium was added,
and cultures were sampled at 2 hpi to monitor initial infection efficiency by FISH as described above and
were further incubated at 20°
C for 24 and 96 h. Released, extracellular L. pneumophila cells were collected
at 96 hpi by centrifuging the supernatant of infected cultures at 150 � g for 2 min to roughly separate
amoebae from bacterial cells, filtering the supernatant through 5-�m syringe filters (Sartorius) to remove
residual amoebae, and finally pelleting the bacterial cells at 12,850 � g for 2 min. L. pneumophila-infected
amoebae as well as uninfected amoebae were harvested, and bacteria were roughly enriched as
previously described (41), but to optimize the yield of intracellular bacteria, cell suspensions were
additionally vortexed for 1 min together with smaller glass beads (diameter, 0.25 to 0.5 mm; Carl Roth)
after vortexing with larger beads (diameter, 0.75 to 1 mm; Carl Roth). Total RNA from extracellular
bacteria (with and without symbionts) and intracellular bacteria enriched from cocultures at 24 and 96
hpi (with and without symbionts) was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham,
MA, USA), and residual DNA was digested using the Turbo DNA-free kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific), both
as described before (41). rRNA depletion using the Ribo-Zero gold rRNA removal kit (Illumina, San Diego,
CA, USA), library preparation using the NEBNext Ultra RNA Library Prep kit for Illumina (New England
Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA), as well as sequencing on an Illumina HiSeq 2500 with 100-bp read length was
performed by the Vienna Biocenter Core Facilities (VBCF) Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) Unit
(http://www.vbcf.ac.at).
Transcriptome analysis. Sequencing reads were subjected to a cleaning workflow, reads were
mapped to the P. amoebophila UWE25 (NC_005861.1) and L. pneumophila Paris (NC_006368.1) genomes,
respectively, differential gene expression was determined, and statistically overrepresented functional
categories were identified, all done as previously described (41). All samples were obtained from
infection experiments set up in biological triplicate. L. pneumophila reads from one replicate at 96 hpi
without symbionts were excluded from further analysis because the expression profile did not match
those of the other replicates. Samples from uninfected symbiont-containing cultures were recovered
from biological duplicates at both time points (24 and 96 hpi) but were treated as four replicates in gene
expression analysis because of their nearly identical expression profiles. Detailed read and mapping
statistics can be found in Table S2.
Data availability. Acanthamoeba sp. strain ML partial 18S rRNA gene sequence was deposited at
GenBank and is accessible through accession number MH675534. RNA-Seq data are available at the Gene
Expression Omnibus (GEO) database and are accessible through accession number GSE125876 (https://
