Abstract
Background: In developed countries, adolescent and young adult diets have been found to be nutritionally poor.
The aim of this study was to examine whether a choice architecture intervention, re-arrangement of produce
within a grocery store to increase the accessibility of fruit and vegetables, affected purchasing behaviour on a
university campus.
Methods: A database of daily sales data from January 2012 to July 2017 was obtained from a campus grocery
store. Two changes to the layout were made during this time period. In January 2015, fruit and vegetables were
moved from the back of the store, furthest from the entrance, to the aisle closest to the entrance and an entrance-
facing display increasing their accessibility. In April 2016, the entrance-facing display of fruit and vegetables was
replaced with a chiller cabinet so that fruit and vegetables remained more accessible than during the baseline
period, but less accessible than in the period immediately previously. A retrospective interrupted time series analysis
using dynamic regression was used to model the data and to examine the effect of the store re-arrangements on
purchasing. All analyses were carried out both for sales-by-quantity and for sales-by-money.
Results: The first shop re-arrangement which made fruit and vegetables more prominent, increased the percentage
of total sales that were fruit and vegetables, when analysed by either items purchased or money spent. The second
rearrangement also had a positive effect on the percentage of total sales that were fruit and vegetables compared
to baseline, however this was not significant at the 5% level. Over the five year period, the percentage of sales that
were fruit and vegetables declined both in terms of items purchased, and money spent.
Conclusions: Increasing accessibility of fruit and vegetables in a grocery store is a feasible way to improve the diet
of students in tertiary education. There is evidence of declining fruit and vegetable consumption among the
studied population, which should be further investigated.

 Background
Inclusion of fruit and vegetables in the diet is recom-
mended for good health by the World Health Organisa-
tion [1] and by policy makers in many countries [2–4].
Meta-analysis of sixteen prospective cohort studies has
demonstrated that increasing fruit and vegetable con-
sumption is associated with lower mortality from all
causes, cardiovascular disease, and cancer [5]. This has
also been demonstrated for the UK population using na-
tionally representative data from the Health Survey for
England [6].
In developed countries, the diets of adolescents and
young adults have been found to be nutritionally poor,
and particularly so, in comparison with other age groups
[7–9]. This is generally true across 28 countries in the
European Union [7]. The Health Survey for England
found that in 2015 16–24 year olds ate a mean of 2.9
portions of fruit and vegetables per day, compared to the
mean for all adults of 3.5 portions per day [8]. Similarly,
the 2015 Scottish Health Survey showed 2.6 portions a
day were consumed by 16–24 year olds and 3.1 portions
per day for all adults [9]. Taking into account the low
current level of consumption in this age-group, and the
potential health benefits, increasing fruit and vegetable
consumption amongst young adults is a desirable public
health goal.
In many developed countries, a large proportion of the
population participates in tertiary education [10]. The
UK government reports the Higher Education Participa-
tion Rate (the likelihood of a young person participating
in Higher Education by age 30) as 48% in 2014/2015
[10]. In 2015/16, the Higher Education Statistics Agency
reports 2,280,830 students in UK Higher Education (and
a further 410,130 staff) [11–13]. Qualitative studies have
found that students in tertiary education experience the
increased independence noted as characteristic of young
adulthood, and report greater autonomy over food
choice than before beginning tertiary education [14–16].
Furthermore, participants in these studies report par-
ticular challenges of university environments including
lack of time or facility for cooking and high availability
of unhealthy choices in campus food outlets [14–16].
This is supported by evidence of unhealthier eating of
students who live on campus compared with students
living off campus in surveys in England [17]. There is
also evidence that students living outside their family
home have unhealthier diets than those living at home:
this is reported among Greek students [18] and in a
multi-country study of Bulgarian, Danish, German and
Polish students [19]. It is unsurprising therefore to find
multiple studies, principally in the US, but also in Eng-
land, reporting a mean weight gain in students who have
recently begun university study [20–23]. Those that
compare students beginning university with their peers
not beginning university found students beginning at
university gained more weight, though studies vary in
the size of effect reported [20, 24].
The UK government’s plan for action on childhood
obesity notes that:
“Every public sector setting, from leisure centres to
hospitals, should have a food environment designed so
the easy choices are also the healthy ones.” [25]
The plan describes how these spaces should ‘set an ex-
ample’ to children and families [25]. It is not clear how
universities fit in to this strategy, as they receive signifi-
cant
amounts
of
public
funding
alongside
private
funding. However, it seems reasonable in this policy en-
vironment, that there will be expectation in the coming
years that universities adopt some degree of health pro-
moting activity. Looking beyond government policy, 88
UK Universities have signed up to ‘Healthy Universities’
,
a voluntary scheme under which they commit to the
principles of the Okanagan Charter (an international
charter for health promotion at universities and col-
leges), which includes the following call to action for
higher education institutions:
“Embed health into all aspects of campus culture,
across the administration, operations and academic
mandates.” [26].
In light of participation rates and the association of uni-
versity study with increasing autonomy, universities offer
a setting in which public health interventions to reduce
obesity and promote healthy diets may have an import-
ant effect.
‘Choice architecture’
, sometimes termed ‘nudge’
, is in-
creasingly being considered as an effective tool to pro-
mote healthy behaviours [27]. Choice architecture in
micro-environments (e.g. homes, workplaces) has been
defined as:
“Interventions that involve altering the properties or
placement of objects or stimuli within micro-
environments with the intention of changing health-
related behaviour. Such interventions are implemented
within the same micro-environment as that in which the
target behaviour is performed, typically require minimal
conscious engagement, can in principle influence the be-
haviour of many people simultaneously, and are not tar-
geted or tailored to specific individuals” [28].
Interventions that altered the environment in tertiary
education food outlets were found to improve diet ac-
cording to various outcomes in a systematic review of
the literature in 2015 [29] and interventions making

 healthy options more easily accessible have been found
to increase healthy behaviour in a number of studies
[30]. Choice architecture might be considered particu-
larly apt for targeting young adults as it does not act by
limiting choice, it respects the autonomy of young adults
and their rights and capacity to make their own deci-
sions in respect of health related behaviours. This is in
contrast with what might be appropriate where the tar-
get population is children. There is also some evidence
derived from qualitative research, that university stu-
dents fail to engage with healthy behaviours because of
perceptions of health problems as distant or their health
as invincible [15, 31]. Thus choice architecture interven-
tions, which may require minimal conscious engagement,
may be more suited to this group than interventions re-
quiring greater conscious engagement.
This study examined whether a choice architecture
intervention, re-arrangement of produce within a gro-
cery store, affected fruit and vegetable purchasing behav-
iour on a university campus.
Methods
Setting
The University of Warwick is a campus university on
the edge of the city of Coventry, in the West Midlands
of England, UK. As of 2017, it had around 26,000 stu-
dents (of which around 15,000 were undergraduates)
[32]. The Rootes grocery store (a branch of Costcutter)
is the only on-campus grocery store and stocks a wide
range of food. Over the study period, it had mean term
time weekly takings of £142,177. There are other outlets
on campus which sell ready-to-eat meals and snacks.
A change to store layout (Intervention A) was made for
January 2015, providing an in-the-field opportunity to in-
vestigate the effect of proximity and ease of access on
what was purchased in store. In particular this made fruit
and vegetables more prominent in the store. Fruit and
vegetables were moved from the back of the store, furthest
from the entrance, to the aisle closest to the entrance and
also an entrance-facing display. A further change (Inter-
vention B) was made in April 2016, replacing the
entrance-facing display of fruit and vegetables with a
chiller cabinet containing drinks (juices, smoothies and
sugar sweetened beverages). The first change (Interven-
tion A) was made at the same time as a store renovation
including changes to the store decoration and branding.
The second change (Intervention B) was the only one
made at this timepoint (Additional file 3).
Data
A database of daily sales data from January 2012 to July
2017 was obtained from Rootes grocery store. The data
contained the daily total quantity sold for each product,
along with the product description, price, profit, barcode,
unit size and the food category. These files were imported
to R software (protecting the original files). Fields in the
database of interest were selected: Sale Date, Category,
Product Description, Price, and Quantity sold. Other vari-
ables were added to the data frame, indicating whether
the day was a day of term time or outside of term time,
the number of days from the beginning of the time period
being studied, and which intervention period the date fell
in (as two binary variables).
Code was written into which a category vector could
be entered and R would return a data frame with quan-
tity of sales made by a particular category aggregated by
day. Although the store categorised sales into 72 cat-
egories, this study focused on fruit and vegetables, which
fell over two till categories: ‘Fruit and Veg’ (fruit and
vegetables purchased in packaging and sold at fixed
prices) and ‘Fruit & Veg Weighed’ (fruit and vegetables
purchased loose and sold by weight).
The data were then aggregated by week. Analysing and
modelling using weekly data produced models that were
both simpler to interpret and better according to the
Ljung-Box test than models using daily data. In addition,
long term effects, rather than day-to-day fluctuations,
were of primary interest.
As would be expected, and from visually inspecting
the data and discussions with store management, univer-
sity term time and holiday periods were understood to
have a major effect on sales across the store. For our
analyses we included only weeks that fell wholly within
term time. In addition it was noted that the final week
of every 10 week term had lower sales of fruit and vege-
tables, which is likely due to students who plan to return
home for the holiday periods reducing their purchases of
perishable food items. For this reason we created a
dummy variable indicating the last week of every term.
Statistical analysis
The study was conducted as a retrospective interrupted
time series analysis using dynamic regression. Inter-
rupted time series analysis is a method for evaluating in-
terventions that take place at a well-defined time point;
it is particularly useful for evaluating interventions for
which a randomised controlled trial is difficult or impos-
sible, such as interventions which work at the level of a
population, and for evaluating interventions retrospect-
ively [33]. This study analyses the effect of an interven-
tion on a population (the customers of a university
grocery store) and was conceived and carried out after
the intervention had taken place (i.e. was retrospective).
Initially, a table of summary statistics was produced.
One-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) tests were under-
taken to determine whether to reject the null hypothesis of
no difference in mean total sales, mean fruit and vegetable

 sales and proportional fruit and vegetable sales between the
intervention periods.
The data frame was converted into a time series object
in R using the xts package [34]. Scatterplots of total daily
sales over time, daily sales of fruit and vegetables and sales
of fruit and vegetables were made using the R package
ggplot2 [35]. At this point data were interpreted visually.
A dynamic regression model was used to model the
total sales and the sales of fruit and vegetables. The
intervention periods were entered into the model using
binary (‘dummy’) variables. Specifically, the model used
was a multiple regression model with an Auto Regressive
Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model for the er-
rors. The regression component captures trends and de-
pendence on other variables (the ‘external regressors’). It
was observed that sales data periods close together in
time had sales more similar than would be expected at
random (i.e. autocorrelation). To capture this autocorrel-
ation, an ARIMA model was used for the errors. ARIMA
models are commonly used for time series data (e.g.
econometric data) which show autocorrelation. A subtlety
here is the inclusion of time as a regressor. ARIMA errors
can capture some types of trend over time (i.e. those due
to drift). However, time was also included as a regressor as
beyond an effect of drift over time it might be expected
that there is some underlying effect of time (e.g. due to na-
tional trends in fruit and vegetable consumption). We also
included the dummy variable indicating the last week of
term as a regressor. To assess the appropriateness of the
model used, another analysis was performed by producing
a linear model with no ARIMA component. R2 calcula-
tions indicated that these models were not preferable to
the dynamic regression models used.
It was then decided to model the proportion of total
sales that were fruit and vegetables, also using dynamic re-
gression. This was to deal with the observation that the
overall total quantity of items bought fluctuated greatly
within the period of study, and this may mask a differen-
tial effect on fruit and vegetables. In particular, in discus-
sion with store management, there was concern that
building works on the plaza area outside the store, which
led to changes in bus routes and bus stop positions, af-
fected total sales at several points in time during the study
period. Using a linear model, rather than a generalised lin-
ear model, is often considered inappropriate when the
outcome variable is a proportion, as proportions are lim-
ited to between 0 and 1. However, the relationship may be
close to linear away from 0 and 1. In particular, a linear
form was considered to give an appropriate approximation
here as all values fell within a relatively narrow range of
0.035 to 0.08 (and all but one between 0.045 and 0.08) and
we are not seeking to extrapolate beyond the data. There-
fore, it was felt that the distorting effects of the boundaries
at 0 and at 1 could be safely ignored.
The R package forecast was used [36]. In particular, the
auto.arima function was used to select the best model,
with the noted external regressors specified. When exter-
nal regressors are included, auto.arima uses regression
first to take into account the external regressors, then
models the errors using an ARIMA model i.e. produces a
dynamic regression model. The package automatically
tests for seasonality, and would in this case return a sea-
sonal model. This was considered sufficient, and although
seasonality can be forced, as auto.arima tests sometimes
fail to pick up on genuine seasonality, this was not consid-
ered necessary (once aggregated by week, the data did not
show any great seasonality from visual inspection).
A Ljung-Box test was used to test the residuals from
the dynamic regression model (this is a portmanteau test
that has as null hypothesis that the autocorrelations of a
time series are zero). The variance inflation factor was
also calculated to check for problematic multicollinearity
requiring caution in interpreting the model.
All analyses were carried out both for sales-by-quantity
and for sales-by-money. Both metrics have disadvantages:
Sales-by-quantity, is of interest from a public health per-
spective. However, there is some risk of masking or pro-
nouncing an effect, if average pack size bought, for
example, changes over the study period; Sales-by-money
avoids this but may introduce problems if the price or
relative price of fruit and vegetables compared with other
items on sale changes over the study period. By examining
the patterns in both models and checking for consistency,
we can be more confident that there is a genuine under-
lying result.
Results
Weeks that fell fully within term time between 09/01/2012
and 02/07/2017 were included in the final dataset. This in-
cluded a total of 170 weeks of data: 90 weeks in the base-
line period (09/01/2012–07/12/2014); 40 weeks during
intervention A (05/01/2015–20/03/2016); and 40 weeks
during intervention B (25/04/2016–02/07/2017).
Figures 1 and 2 show scatterplots of percentage of
sales that were fruit and vegetables, by quantity and by
money respectively. In both figures there is an apparent
downward trend in the percentage of sales which are
fruit and vegetables across the time period, with a per-
ceivable upswing in the period of Intervention A. It is
also clear that in the last week of each 10 week term,
there is a lower percentage of fruit and vegetable sales
than in the previous 9 weeks.
There were just over 93,000 sales on average per week
across the time period, of which 5564 (5.97%) were fruit and
vegetable sales (Table 1). ANOVA tests demonstrated highly
significant (p < 0.001) differences in the percentage of total
sales that were fruit and vegetables between the time pe-
riods relating to baseline, intervention A and intervention

 B (Table 1). The percentage of total sales that were fruit
and vegetables fell from 6.29% at baseline, to 6.07% during
the intervention A time period and then to 5.23% during
implementation of intervention B (Table 1).
The dynamic regression models demonstrate a significant
downward trend in the percentage of sales which were fruit
and vegetables by quantity and by money across the whole
time period. Both models additionally show a significant in-
crease in the percentage of sales which were fruit and vege-
tables by quantity and by money during the intervention A
time period, and an increase in the percentage of sales
which were fruit and vegetables by quantity and by money
during the intervention B time period that was not signifi-
cant (Tables 2 and 3). In terms of the percentage of total
sales which were fruit and vegetables by quantity, during
Intervention A this increased by 0.97 percentage points and
in terms of the percentage of total sales which were fruit
and vegetables by money taken, during Intervention A this
increased by 0.69 percentage points.
For both models, the Ljung-Box test was significant, there-
fore the plots of autocorrelation function for the residuals
left when fitting the models of percentage sales were
inspected (Additional file 1: Figure S1 and Additional file 2:
Figure S2). Inspection of the residuals did not give further
cause for concern: there is no discernible patterning (e.g.
from a seasonality effect not taken into account).
Discussion
The effect of the shop re-arrangement to make fruit and
vegetables more prominent (Intervention A) increased
the percentage of total sales that were fruit and vegeta-
bles, when analysed by either items purchased or money
spent. The effect of Intervention B, which was the same
as Intervention A but for the replacement of a display of
fruit and vegetables directly facing the entrance to the
shop with a chiller cabinet, is less clear. It had a positive
coefficient (compared to baseline) for both percentage
sales by quantity and percentage sales by money, but this
indicated increase was no longer significant at the 95%
level. Therefore, it is likely, though not highly likely, that
the choice architecture presented in Intervention B
boosted percentage sales of fruit and vegetables com-
pared with baseline.

 The second, more concerning, major result of this
study is the observed effect of time. The coefficient of
time in the best fit model is negative in percentage fruit
and vegetable sales by quantity, percentage fruit and
vegetable sales by money and absolute fruit and vege-
table sales by quantity, indicating a decrease in sales over
time. In particular, the decline in percentage sales by
money and sales by quantity was significant.
The lines (ie: types of products) stocked by the shop
did not change greatly over the study period, meaning
this likely represents a decline in the percentage of pur-
chases being fruit and vegetables amongst the popula-
tion making up the store customers.
Our first major result is supported by previous choice
architecture literature suggesting that layout changes
can positively influence buying behaviour such that more
healthy food is bought. In a systematic review of inter-
ventions involving changing food placement on food
choices, manipulating the order in which food products
are encountered or the proximity of food options were
found to influence purchasing behaviour [30]. In a sys-
tematic review of choice architecture interventions to
improve healthy eating among healthcare personnel,
similar ‘proximity’ interventions, such as arranging dis-
plays to make healthier products easier to access were
found to be an effective way to ‘nudge’ consumers into
making healthier purchases [37]. Other choice architec-
ture interventions such as providing nutrition labelling
and increasing the availability of healthy food, increased
healthier food choices in tertiary education settings [29].
Universities should consider how to encourage campus
retailers to use these techniques to promote healthy be-
haviour by their staff and students, perhaps through
contract agreements.
In terms of the second major result, there is some indi-
cation it may be evidence of a more general trend. Health
Survey for England data indicate that amongst 16 to
24 year olds, mean portions per day of fruit and vegetables
have been on a monotonic downward trend since 2006
from 3.1 to 2.9 in 2015 (although taking into account
standard errors, these values may not differ) [8]. There are
other possible explanations: perhaps fruit and vegetables
became more expensive in this shop compared to other
local shops over the study period, for example, and the
population chose to buy fruit and vegetables elsewhere.
Due to the potentially serious consequences of declining
fruit and vegetable consumption in this age group for pub-
lic health, this observation merits further investigation.
The principal strength of this study is it examines a ‘nat-
ural experiment’: changes made to store layout as a normal
part of store operations that affected the location of fruit
and vegetables. Moreover, purchasing data were collected
and stored as a normal part of store operations. This of-
fered the opportunity for a long follow up and meant that
historical data could be used and analysed, rather than hav-
ing a researcher observe participants or any other design
that might make it evident that purchases were being ob-
served. Hence, no one purchasing food in the store was
aware of the fact that their purchases would be analysed in
order to assess fruit and vegetable purchasing behaviour.
Another advantage of this study is the volume of data
collected. Data were collected from every purchase made
in store from January 2012 to July 2017. This gives a
long period in each intervention stage. This is advanta-
geous as many studies report follow ups of a few months
at most [29]. It may be the case that an effect is not sus-
tained long term: a behaviour change may be triggered
by the novel layout, but as consumers become aware of
their new purchasing behaviours or used to the new en-
vironment it may wane. In examining the scatterplots
we may see some waning of the effect. However, the fact
that the dynamic regression models indicate a boost of
both interventions, and statistically significantly so for
intervention A, indicates some maintenance of the effect
of the change. Nonetheless, the issue of whether the ef-
fect of a choice architecture ‘proximity’ change wanes
over time merits further investigation and awareness.
This study has many limitations associated with its de-
sign. In particular, the fact the data are from a ‘natural
experiment’ means it was not possible to adequately
control for other factors that may have affected purchas-
ing behaviour as would have been possible in a cluster
randomised controlled trial. Some of these could be
taken into account, or dismissed as only having minor
effects on the results from discussions with store man-
agement. For example, the effect of university term time,
other changes in store (lines stocked, price inflation).
Others, however, such as the building work, may have
had an effect on the results.
Building works taking place in 2014 and 2015 on the
campus, involved many changes taking place over a period
of months, with differing effects on footfall, including
movement of a bus-stop previously located outside the
store, which the store manager believed had resulted in re-
duced footfall at the shop. For this reason we chose to
model percentage of total sales that were fruit and vegeta-
bles rather than absolute sales of fruit and vegetables. It
may be argued that it is absolute, not percentage, sales of
fruit and vegetables that are of interest from a public
health perspective. However, as overall total sales fell
around the time that Intervention A was implemented
(likely due to the change in position of a bus-stop) any as-
sociation between intervention period and absolute sales
were likely to be attributable to confounding factors.
Conclusions
The main conclusion of this study is that a change to
store layout can boost purchasing of fruit and vegetables

 in a UK tertiary education setting, and this effect appears
to be maintained over time. This is therefore a viable
method of improving the nutritional quality of diets in
this population and should be considered by universities
when designing retail facilities on campus or contracting
private retailers.
A second conclusion is that a trend of declining fruit
and vegetable purchasing over the five and a half year
study period was seen. This merits further investigation
to examine whether this effect is repeated more widely.
If so, it represents a threat to public health, and the fac-
tors driving it ought to be examined and understood in
order that it might be tackled and reversed.
