Abstract
Klebsiella pneumoniae is an important cause of multidrug-resistant
infections worldwide. Recent studies highlight the emergence of
multidrug-resistant K. pneumoniae strains which show resistance
to colistin, a last-line antibiotic, arising from mutational inactiva-
tion of the mgrB regulatory gene. However, the precise molecular
resistance mechanisms of mgrB-associated colistin resistance and
its impact on virulence remain unclear. Here, we constructed an
mgrB gene K. pneumoniae mutant and performed characterisation
of its lipid A structure, polymyxin and antimicrobial peptide resis-
tance, virulence and inflammatory responses upon infection. Our
data reveal that mgrB mutation induces PhoPQ-governed lipid A
remodelling which confers not only resistance to polymyxins, but
also enhances K. pneumoniae virulence by decreasing antimicrobial
peptide susceptibility and attenuating early host defence response
activation. Overall, our findings have important implications for
patient management and antimicrobial stewardship, while also
stressing antibiotic resistance development is not inexorably linked
with subdued bacterial fitness and virulence.

Introduction
The widespread emergence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacterial
pathogens is an important public health challenge worldwide
(World Health Organization, 2014). Infections with MDR organisms
are associated with increased mortality, longer hospital stays and
inflated healthcare costs (Lambert et al, 2011; Neidell et al, 2012;
Martin-Loeches et al, 2015). Recent data also indicate a trend
towards increased antibiotic resistance among cases of community-
onset infections (Lim et al, 2014; World Health Organization, 2014;
Stefaniuk et al, 2016). For many bacterial pathogens, particularly
Gram-negative organisms, high rates of antimicrobial resistance
present limited therapeutic options for treating serious infections.
Klebsiella pneumoniae is one of these MDR organisms identified
as an urgent threat to human health by the World Health Organiza-
tion, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the UK
Department of Health. K. pneumoniae infections are particularly a
problem among neonates, elderly and immunocompromised indi-
viduals within the healthcare setting, but this organism is also
responsible for a significant number of community-acquired infec-
tions including pneumonia and sepsis (Paczosa & Mecsas, 2016;
Quan et al, 2016). The lineage defined as sequence type (ST) 258 is
a notorious example of MDR K. pneumoniae; ST-258 frequently
carries the K. pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC) gene, as well as
numerous other acquired AMR determinants, and has been respon-
sible for outbreaks on several continents (Paczosa & Mecsas, 2016).
Colistin is now often considered as the last treatment option for
KPC-producing K. pneumoniae, but reports of colistin-resistant
Klebsiella isolates are on the rise (Tzouvelekis et al, 2012; Olaitan
et al, 2014b; Nation et al, 2015).
Several recent studies highlight the emergence of colistin resis-
tance in MDR K. pneumoniae arising from loss-of-function muta-
tions of the mgrB gene, a negative regulator of the PhoPQ signalling
system (Lippa & Goulian, 2009; Cannatelli et al, 2013; Olaitan et al,
2014a; Poirel et al, 2015; Wright et al, 2015; Zowawi et al, 2015).
The PhoPQ two-component system is a well-known regulator of
envelope remodelling, chiefly the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) lipid A
section, and contributes to bacterial resistance to innate immune
killing (Groisman, 2001; Llobet et al, 2011). K. pneumoniae PhoPQ
also governs lipid A plasticity in vivo and in vitro (Llobet et al,
2015) and plays a role in virulence as assayed using the wax moth
Galleria mellonella infection model (Insua et al, 2013).
Alarmingly, the evidence indicates that mgrB-dependent colistin
resistance is not associated with a significant fitness cost in vitro
and is stably maintained in the absence of selective pressure

 (Cannatelli et al, 2015), which may explain the rapid dissemination
of strains carrying this resistance mechanism in the clinical setting
(Cannatelli et al, 2013, 2014; Olaitan et al, 2014a; Cheng et al,
2015; Poirel et al, 2015; Wright et al, 2015; Zowawi et al, 2015).
However, the precise molecular resistance mechanisms of mgrB-
associated colistin-resistant K. pneumoniae remain unclear. More-
over, it is currently unknown whether mgrB mutation confers any
loss of virulence. This is particularly critical given the increasing
number of K. pneumoniae infections caused by virulent clones and
the ease with which mgrB mutations arise in the hospital setting.
To answer these clinically relevant questions, we constructed a
mgrB mutant in a K. pneumoniae strain representative of the viru-
lent Klebsiella clonal groups, therefore encoding the genetic determi-
nants associated with severe human infections (Lery et al, 2014;
Holt et al, 2015). The evidence presented in this work demonstrates
that inactivation of mgrB not only results in colistin resistance, but
also enhances K. pneumoniae virulence by decreasing the suscepti-
bility to a plethora of antimicrobial peptides and attenuating the
activation of host defence responses.
Results
Deletion of mgrB confers increased colistin resistance and
multiple lipid A modifications in a PhoPQ-dependent manner
To solidify earlier reports indicating an association between mgrB
gene mutation and colistin resistance, we constructed an mgrB
mutant (referred to as 52145-DmgrB herein) in the wild-type viru-
lent K. pneumoniae strain 52145 (Kp52145 herein). Control experi-
ments showed that the growth kinetics in rich and minimal media
were similar between the wild-type and 52145-DmgrB strains
(Fig EV1A). The 52145-DmgrB mutant showed a slightly increased
capacity to form a short-term biofilm compared to the wild type
(Fig EV1B).
Upon Etest� minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) testing, we
demonstrated a 128-fold increase in colistin resistance in 52145-
DmgrB (16.0 lg/ml) compared to the wild type (0.125 lg/ml;
Fig 1A). Similar results were obtained when testing the susceptibil-
ity to polymyxin B (Appendix Fig S1), another cyclic polypeptide
also used in clinical practice to treat MDR Gram-negative bacterial
infections (Nation et al, 2015). When the mgrB mutant was comple-
mented (strain 52145-DmgrBCom), MICs to colistin and polymyxin
B were restored to wild-type levels (0.125 lg/ml; Fig 1A and
Appendix Fig S1).
Resistance to colistin and polymyxin B is associated with remod-
elling in the lipid A (Olaitan et al, 2014b). To determine whether
mgrB mutation results in lipid A changes, lipid A was extracted from
the wild-type strain and the mgrB mutant using an ammonium
hydroxide/isobutyric acid method and subjected to negative ion
matrix-assisted laser desorption–ionisation time-of-flight (MALDI-
TOF) mass spectrometry. Consistent with our earlier work, lipid A
from the wild-type strain (Figs 1B and EV2, Appendix Table S1)
showed hexa-acylated species (mass-to-charge ratio, [m/z] 1,824)
corresponding to two glucosamines, two phosphates, four 3-OH-C14
and two myristate (C14), as well as two other peaks including m/z
1,840, corresponding to two glucosamines, two phosphates, four
3-OH-C14, one C14 and one -hydroxymyristate (C14:OH), and m/z
2,063 consistent with the addition of palmitate (m/z 239) to the
hexa-acylated (m/z 1,824) species to produce a hepta-acylated lipid
A (Llobet et al, 2011, 2015). Lipid A isolated from 52145-DmgrB
(Fig 1C) contained species m/z 1,824, m/z 1,840 and m/z 2,063
which were found also in the wild-type lipid A. In addition, we
observed other lipid A species consistent with the addition of phos-
phoethanolamine (PEtN; m/z 124) and 4-amino-4-deoxy-L-arabinose
(Ara4N; m/z 131) to the hexa-acylated m/z 1,824 to obtain species
m/z 1,948 and m/z 1,955, respectively, and species m/z 2,079
consistent with the addition of palmitate to ion m/z 1,840 (Fig EV2).
Other ions detected in the 52145-DmgrB lipid A comprised m/z
1,850 and m/z 1,866 consistent with four R-3-hydroxymyristoyl
primary acyl chains, either one C14 or one C14:OH, respectively, and
one palmitate (Llobet et al, 2015). Complementation of the mgrB
mutant restored production of wild-type lipid A (Fig 1D).
We next investigated the lipid A of several previously published
K. pneumoniae clinical strains linked to mgrB inactivation and
colistin resistance (Poirel et al, 2015). We selected two isogenic ST-
258 strains isolated from the same patient prior to (strain T1a) and
after (strain T1b) colistin therapy and the development of mgrB-
associated colistin resistance, along with four other colistin-resistant
mgrB mutants (C21, C22, C2 and 15I5) from individual patients
comprising various geographic sources, genetic backgrounds, multi-
drug
resistance
mechanisms
and
mgrB
sequence
mutations
(Appendix Table S2). Appendix Fig S2 shows that the lipid A species
produced by the T1a strain were similar to those observed in the
wild-type Kp52145 strain, whereas T1b lipid A showed the same
modifications as that of the 52145-DmgrB mutant. This latter finding
was also consistent for each of the other clinical colistin-resistant
mgrB mutant strains analysed.
Earlier work indicates that in K. pneumoniae, the dioxygenase
LpxO is responsible for the generation of 2-hydroxymyristate, PagP
is the acyltransferase required for the addition of palmitate to the
lipid A, PmrC mediates the incorporation of PEtN (Llobet et al,
2011, 2015; Wright et al, 2015), whereas synthesis and addition of
Ara4N is mediated by the pmrHFIJKLM operon (Llobet et al, 2011).
To verify that these loci were indeed responsible for mgrB-depen-
dent lipid A modifications, we constructed a range of double, triple,
quadruple and quintuple lpxO, pagP, pmrC and pmrF mutants in the
52145-DmgrB background (Appendix Table S3) and analysed their
lipid A structure. As anticipated, lpxO mutants lacked lipid A species
containing 2-hydroxymyristate, pagP mutants did not contain
species with palmitate, pmrF mutants lacked Ara4N-modified lipid
A species, and pmrC mutants did not produce lipid A species modi-
fied with PEtN (Appendix Fig S3). It should be noted that the
absence of a lipid A modification did not have an impact on the
others.
The increased production of modified lipid A species in the mgrB
mutant led us to investigate whether the expression of the loci
responsible for these modifications was upregulated in the mgrB
mutant background. To quantitatively assess the transcription of
these loci, we used four transcriptional fusions containing a
promoterless luciferase firefly gene (lucFF) under the control of the
relevant locus promoter region. Each fusion (i.e. lpxO::lucFF, pagP::
lucFF, pmrC::lucFF and pmrH::lucFF) was introduced into Kp52145,
52145-DmgrB and 52145-DmgrBCom, and then, luciferase activity
was measured. Compared to the wild-type strain, we observed
significantly upregulated expression of all the transcriptional fusions

 in 52145-DmgrB (Fig 1E–H). In contrast, the luciferase activities of
all transcriptional fusions in the mgrB-complemented strain were
not significantly different than those observed in the wild-type
background.
Based on the fact that the two-component PhoPQ and PmrAB
systems govern the remodelling of Klebsiella lipid A (Llobet et al,
2011), we sought to determine the contribution of these two-compo-
nent systems to mgrB-mediated lipid A changes. Lipid A produced
by the mgrB-phoQ and mgrB-phoQ-pmrAB mutants resembled that
of the wild type, whereas lipid A synthesised by the mgrB-pmrAB
mutant and DmgrB-DphoQ complemented with phoPQ (52145-
DmgrB-DphoQGB-phoPQCom) were similar to the lipid A produced
by the mgrB mutant (Fig EV3 and Appendix Table S1). Taken
together, these data suggest that mgrB-mediated lipid A modifi-
cations are PhoPQ dependent. Further stressing the connection
between MgrB and PhoPQ, phoP::lucFF activity was higher in the
mgrB mutant than in the wild-type strain (Fig 1I), and the luciferase
activities of lpxO, pagP, pmrF and pmrC transcriptional fusions were
not significantly different between the mgrB-phoQ mutant and the
wild type (Fig 1E–I). Importantly, we also confirmed that the
colistin and polymyxin B resistance phenotype observed in the mgrB
mutant
was
PhoPQ
but
not
PmrAB
dependent
(Fig 1A
and
Appendix Fig S1).
Collectively, these data demonstrate that deletion of the mgrB
gene gives rise to colistin and polymyxin B resistance in a PhoPQ-
dependent manner. Upregulation of the PhoPQ system results in
increased expression of lpxO, pagP, pmrC and pmrF, which in turn
facilitates lipid A modifications with 2-hydroxymyristate, Ara4N,
PEtN and palmitate. Significantly, these lipid A modifications were
also observed in a broad selection of other clinically derived mgrB
mutants showing colistin-resistant phenotypes.
Inactivation of mgrB mediates increased resistance to
antimicrobial peptides
It is widely recognised that polymyxin antibiotics share a similar
mode of action to cationic antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) with vari-
ous studies demonstrating the relationship between polymyxin and
AMP resistance (Groisman, 2001; McPhee et al, 2003; Campos et al,
2004). Therefore, we speculated that 52145-DmgrB may also show
decreased susceptibility to AMPs. To test this hypothesis, we
exposed Kp52145, 52145-DmgrB and 52145-DmgrBCom to four dif-
ferent human AMPs over 1 h and determined the proportion of
surviving organisms. For human neutrophil peptide-1 (1.2 lM), we
showed significantly (P = 0.0006) increased resistance in 52145-
DmgrB when compared to the wild type (Fig 2A). Likewise, there
was significantly (P ≤ 0.013) increased survival of 52145-DmgrB
following exposure to each of three b-defensins (Fig 2B–D). The
complemented strain showed similar AMP susceptibility to that of
the wild type, indicating that mgrB mutation confers protection
against human AMPs.
In vivo it is appreciated that several AMPs act in a synergistic
manner in the infected tissue to combat invading pathogens (Afacan
et al, 2013). Therefore, exposure to one AMP does not recapitulate
the AMP challenge faced by a pathogen in vivo. To mimic this
in vivo scenario, we thus turned to the Galleria mellonella infection
model where only hours after infection, multiple AMPs are synthe-
sised and released into the hemolymph to neutralise bacterial
infection (Kavanagh & Reeves, 2004; Insua et al, 2013). Haemo-
lymph was collected from G. mellonella challenged with heat-killed
(HK) Escherichia coli, and the susceptibility of Kp52145, 52145-
DmgrB and 52145-DmgrBCom to the AMPs present in the haemo-
lymph was determined using a radial diffusion bioassay. The mgrB
mutant was significantly more resistant than the wild type to AMPs
present in G. mellonella haemolymph (Fig 2E). Complementation
restored the mgrB mutant susceptibility to wild-type levels, demon-
strating that mgrB mutation confers resistance to a repertoire of
AMPs produced in response to bacterial infections.
Multiple lipid A modifications contribute to mgrB-mediated
colistin resistance
To delineate the relative contributions of the lipid A modifications
to the polymyxin resistance phenotype of the mgrB mutant, we
undertook susceptibility testing using the Etest� on each of the
double-,
triple-
and
quadruple-mutant
Kp52145
strains.
We
observed a substantial reduction in MIC for both colistin and poly-
myxin B only in lpxO and/or pmrF mutant strains (Fig 3A and B).
To provide additional evidence for the involvement of these lipid
A modifications in the mgrB-mediated resistance phenotype, we
then calculated the per cent survival of the wild-type and mutant
strains after a 1-h colistin (20 lg/ml) challenge. As anticipated, we
observed a marked difference (P < 0.0001) in mean per cent
survival between the wild-type (3.8 � 3.8%) and 52145-DmgrB
(83.6 � 15.34%) strains (Fig 3C). Complementation fully restored
the colistin resistance of the mgrB mutant to wild-type levels
(Fig 3C), with similar results observed for polymyxin B (Fig 3D).
Extended analyses of the double, triple and quadruple mutants
when exposed to colistin provided confirmation of the results
obtained using the Etest�. Indeed, compared to 52145-DmgrB, the
52145-DmgrB-DlpxO and 52145-DmgrB-DpmrF strains showed a
significant (P ≤ 0.02) reduction in mean per cent survival (Fig 3C).
The contribution of lipid A modifications with Ara4N and 2-hydro-
xymyristate to survival was also confirmed in the 52145-DpmrC-
DlpxO-DmgrB,
52145-DmgrB-DlpxO-DpmrF
and
52145-DpmrC-
DlpxO-DmgrB-DpmrF strains. In accordance with the colistin Etest�,
we observed no difference in per cent survival between 52145-
DpagP-DmgrB and 52145-DmgrB (P = 0.99), which corroborated
earlier work showing that lipid A modification with palmitate is not
involved in K. pneumoniae polymyxin resistance (Llobet et al,
2011). In contrast to the Etest� MIC results, our data did reveal a
significant difference in survival between 52145-DpmrC-DmgrB and
52145-DmgrB (P < 0.001); but with the 52145-DpmrC-DlpxO-DmgrB
triple mutant, the anticipated amplified effect of removing both
pmrC and lpxO was not evident.
In summary, we provide definitive evidence that the colistin and
polymyxin B resistance phenotype of 52145-DmgrB occurs through
at least two key modifications to the lipid A structure: the additions
of Ara4N and 2-hydroxymyristate.
Hypervirulence of K. pneumoniae 52145-DmgrB in the
G. mellonella infection model
A strong correlation between the virulence of several MDR bacteria,
including K. pneumoniae, in G. mellonella and mammalian viru-
lence models has been established (Jander et al, 2000; Insua et al,

 2013; Jacobs et al, 2014). Importantly, we demonstrated that the
G. mellonella model recapitulates key features of K. pneumoniae
infection biology (Insua et al, 2013). To determine the pathogenic
potential of the mgrB mutant in G. mellonella, we injected an equiv-
alent dose of the wild-type, 52145-DmgrB, 52145-DmgrB-DphoQGB
and complemented strains into G. mellonella and monitored bacte-
rial killing over time. No mortality was observed in the control
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)-injected G. mellonella larvae. After
72 h, 60–70% of the larvae challenged with Kp52145 and 52145-
DmgrB-DphoQGB survived. In stark contrast, only 18% of the larvae
infected with 52145-DmgrB survived (Fig 4A). Complementation of
the mgrB mutant restored the virulence to wild-type levels, indicat-
ing that mgrB mutation mediates the hypervirulence phenotype.
This increase in virulence was also observed when the killing poten-
tial of a clinical colistin-resistant mgrB isolate was investigated.
Figure 4B shows that infection with the colistin-resistant mgrB
mutant (T1b) strain resulted in increased mortality as compared to
the isogenic colistin-susceptible ancestral (T1a) strain.
It has been previously shown that boosting immunity in
G. mellonella
by
pre-immunisation
with
HK-E. coli
provides
protection
against
subsequent
K. pneumoniae
infection
(Insua
et al, 2013). Therefore, we sought to determine whether mgrB
mutation also confers hypervirulence in G. mellonella with stimu-
lated host immunity. To this end, we inoculated larvae with 106
HK-E. coli and then after 24 h infected with 106 CFUs of Kp52145
or 52145-DmgrB. Confirming earlier work, larvae infected with
Kp52145 showed a significant survival improvement if pre-immu-
nised
(Fig 4D).
However,
there
was
no
survival
difference
between the 52145-DmgrB-infected larvae receiving pre-inocula-
tion with HK-E. coli and the PBS vehicle (P = 0.76; Fig 4D), thus
indicating that mgrB mutation increases virulence even in the
pre-immunised host.
Earlier work from our group illustrated that K. pneumoniae
capsule
polysaccharide
(CPS)
is
crucial
for
virulence
in
G. mellonella (Insua et al, 2013). To explore the contribution of CPS
to the hypervirulence of the mgrB mutant, we compared the killing
ability of the cps mutant (52145-DmanC) and the double mgrB-cps
mutant (52145-DmgrB-DmanC). One hundred per cent of the larvae
infected with 106 CFUs of either 52145-DmanC or 52145-DmgrB-
DmanC
survived
after
72 h
(Fig EV4A).

 showed that both the wild type and mgrB mutant expressed the
same amount of cell-bound CPS (187.1 � 8.8 lg/109 CFUs versus
177.7 � 14.2 lg/109 CFUs, respectively; P = 0.30). Nor was there
any difference in the cps::lucFF activity determined in Kp52145 and
52145-DmgrB backgrounds (Fig EV4B). Overall, these data demon-
strate that both mgrB mutation and CPS are necessary to increase
K. pneumoniae virulence in G. mellonella, although MgrB does not
control CPS expression.
To provide mechanistic insights into the mgrB hypervirulence
phenotype, we investigated whether any of the lipid modifications
found in the 52145-DmgrB lipid A contributed to the heightened
virulence. Upon infection with the double-, triple- and quadruple-
mutant strains, there was no difference in mortality when compared
to 52145-DmgrB (Appendix Fig S4). However, infection with the

 cent survival compared to 52145-DmgrB (Fig 4C). Furthermore,
there was no difference in mortality when compared to that trig-
gered by the wild type. Collectively, these data provide evidence
that 52145-DmgrB pathogenicity in G. mellonella is combinatorial
with all four lipid A modifications required to result in the overall
virulence phenotype.
K. pneumoniae 52145-DmgrB infection is not attenuated in a
murine infection model
The hypervirulence of 52145-DmgrB in G. mellonella prompted us
to examine the ability of this mutant to cause infection in a
mammalian infection model. C57BL/6 mice were intranasally
inoculated with 3 × 105 organisms, and bacterial loads in lung,
spleen and nasal-associated lymphoid tissue (NALT) homogenates
were determined at 24 h post-infection. Bacterial loads of 52145-
DmgrB in the NALT, lung and splenic samples were similar to
those of the wild type (P ≥ 0.14; Fig 5A–C). We also sought to
compare the level of inflammatory cytokine and antimicrobial
peptide expression in the lungs of mice infected with Kp52145
and 52145-DmgrB. Expression of Tnfa, Ifnb, Il1b, Il6, Il10 or Il12
was measured by real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) with
levels of all cytokines, excluding Ifnb, higher in lungs of infected
mice than in lungs of non-infected animals (Appendix Fig S5;
P < 0.05 for all comparisons versus non-infected mice). Interest-
ingly, the mgrB mutant induced the same levels of all cytokines
as the wild-type strain, and this was also true when the expres-
sion
of
murine
defensins
was
analysed
(Appendix
Fig

Overall, these findings suggest that mgrB mutation does not
compromise
K. pneumoniae
immune-evasion
strategies
in
the
mouse model.
K. pneumoniae 52145-DmgrB attenuates the expression of
antimicrobial peptides in the G. mellonella infection model
We have previously demonstrated that there is a correlation
between
K. pneumoniae
virulence
and
the
expression
of
G. mellonella AMPs. The levels of AMPs are higher in larvae
infected with an avirulent K. pneumoniae cps mutant than in larvae
infected with the wild-type strain (Insua et al, 2013). The increased
virulence of the mgrB mutant led us to investigate whether this
mutant affects the expression of AMPs in G. mellonella. After 8 h of
infection, the expression of lysozyme, gallerimycin and galiomycin
was significantly (P < 0.0001) lower in 52145-DmgrB-infected larvae

 than in the wild-type-infected larvae (Fig 5D and Appendix Fig S7).
Infection
with
the
52145-DpmrC-DlpxO-DmgrB,
52145-DmgrB-
DlpxO-DpmrF and 52145-DpmrC-DlpxO-DmgrB-DpmrF triple and
quadruple mutants restored lysozyme expression to wild-type levels
(Fig 3D). Based on these data, we surmised that the lpxO mutation
present in each of these three strains played a primary role in this
phenotype. To explore this hypothesis, lysozyme expression was
assessed during infections with an lpxO mutant (52145-DlpxO), the
52145-DmgrB-DlpxO
double
mutant
and
52145-DmgrB-DlpxO
complemented with lpxO (52145-DmgrB-DlpxO-lpxOCom). Interest-
ingly, expression of this AMP among the single and double Kleb-
siella mutant-infected larvae was similar to the wild type (P ≥ 0.38);
however, the 52145-DmgrB-DlpxO-lpxOCom strain induced an iden-
tical phenotype to the 52145-DmgrB mutant (P < 0.0001; Fig 5D).
Likewise, expression of gallerimycin and galiomycin was reduced
among
larvae
infected
with
52145-DmgrB-DlpxO-lpxOCom
(Fig EV5). These findings demonstrated that mgrB mutation is asso-
ciated with an attenuated expression of G. mellonella AMPs upon
infection. Furthermore, this phenotype is dependent on LpxO-
controlled lipid A modification.
Early inflammatory responses in macrophages are subdued upon
infection with 52145-DmgrB
The recognition of the lipid A pattern by the TLR4/MD-2 complex
activates
NF-jB
and
MAP
kinase
(MAPK)-regulated
defence
responses necessary to clear infections. The distinct lipid A
produced by the mgrB mutant and the mgrB-dependent attenuation
of G. mellonella defence responses led us to investigate the signal-
ling pathways and inflammatory responses triggered by the mgrB
mutant in macrophages. Immortalised bone marrow-derived macro-
phages (iBMDMs) were infected with the wild type, mgrB mutant
and the mgrB mutant-complemented strain with the activation of
NF-jB and MAPKs assessed by immunoblotting. In the canonical
NF-jB activation pathway, nuclear translocation of NF-jB is
preceded by phosphorylation and subsequent degradation of IjBa.
All strains triggered the degradation of IjBa (Fig 6A). Whereas the
wild type and mgrB-complemented strain induced phosphorylation
of the p38, JNK and ERK MAPKs, the mgrB mutant triggered
reduced phosphorylation of the three MAPKs (Fig 6B). Similar
results were obtained when MH-S macrophages were infected
(Appendix Fig S8A), thus indicating that the failure to activate
MAPKs by the mgrB mutant is not cell type dependent. Control
experiments showed that K. pneumoniae-triggered TNF-a is depen-
dent on MAPKs JNK and ERK but not on p38 because the levels of
this cytokine were significantly lower only in the supernatants of
infected macrophages treated with the ERK and JNK inhibitors
(U0126 and SP600125, respectively) than in infected cells treated
with vehicle solution or the p38 inhibitor (Appendix Fig S8B). As
anticipated, based on the reduced activation of JNK and ERK by the
mgrB mutant, levels of TNF-a in the supernatants of macrophages
infected with the mgrB mutant were significantly lower than those
found in the supernatants of cells infected with either the wild type
or the mgrB-complemented strain. Mechanistically, the reduced acti-
vation of MAPKs JNK and ERK by the mgrB mutant was dependent
on the four mgrB-controlled lipid A modifications because only the
quintuple mutant triggered a consistently similar pattern of MAPK
phosphorylation as the wild-type strain (Fig 6C). In good agreement
with these results, the quintuple mutant induced levels of TNF-a
similar to the wild-type strain (Fig 6D). Taken together, our
data demonstrate that inactivation of mgrB in K. pneumoniae results
in reduced activation of inflammatory signalling pathways in
macrophages.
Discussion
The increasing isolation of MDR Gram-negative pathogens resistant
to polymyxins, which are considered a last treatment option for
these infections, is a health challenge worldwide. It is therefore
important to define the molecular mechanisms responsible for poly-
myxin resistance and also to address whether the virulence of the
pathogen is affected. The latter aspect is often neglected in those
studies investigating MDR pathogens, and it is crucially important
in the clinical setting where infections occur in immunocompro-
mised patients.
Several studies have reported the emergence of colistin resistance
in MDR K. pneumoniae arising from loss-of-function mutations of
the mgrB gene (Cannatelli et al, 2013, 2014; Lopez-Camacho et al,
2014; Olaitan et al, 2014a; Cheng et al, 2015; Giani et al, 2015;
Poirel et al, 2015; Wright et al, 2015; Zowawi et al, 2015). In this
work, by combining biochemistry and genetics, we demonstrate that
mgrB
mutation
in
K. pneumoniae
is
associated
with
PhoPQ-
governed lipid A remodelling which confers resistance to polymyx-
ins and mammalian antimicrobial peptides. Mechanistically, our
findings reveal that the lipid A modifications with Ara4N and
2-hydroxymyristate mediate the resistance to polymyxins. Our
results revealed that mgrB mutation increases K. pneumoniae viru-
lence in the G. mellonella infection model, whereas it does not
compromise K. pneumoniae survival in the mouse pneumonia
model, hence further reinforcing the notion that the development of
antibiotic resistance is not inexorably linked to decreased virulence
and fitness costs.
Earlier work showed that MgrB is a small (47 amino acids),
membrane-bound peptide which acts as negative feedback regula-
tor of the PhoPQ two-component regulatory system (Lippa &
Goulian, 2009). The fact that PhoPQ controls the expression of loci
required for remodelling of the lipid A led to the assumption that
mgrB mutation should be associated with changes in the lipid A
structure, chiefly the addition of Ara4N to the lipid A. This notion
was based on indirect experimental evidence showing that the
transcription of the pmrF operon, responsible for the addition of
Ara4N to the lipid A, is upregulated in an mgrB mutant back-
ground (Cannatelli et al, 2013; Wright et al, 2015). However, none
of these assumptions have been formally proven. In this work, we
demonstrate extensive remodelling of the lipid A produced by
K. pneumoniae mgrB mutants, which is modified with Ara4N,
2-hydroxymyristate, palmitate and PEtN. Mechanistically, we have
demonstrated that the pmrF operon, lpxO, pagP and pmrC are the
loci responsible for these lipid A modifications in the mgrB
mutant. Furthermore, we provide conclusive evidence showing the
crucial role of PhoPQ governing all of these lipid A modifications.
PhoPQ is responsible for the upregulated expression of the pmrF
operon, lpxO, pagP and pmrC observed in the mgrB mutant.
However, our analysis ruled out the contribution of the PmrAB
two-component
system

 a contribution of the PmrC-dependent PEtN modification was
observed when the polymyxin susceptibility was assessed using a
standard assay in the antimicrobial peptide field. Whereas it is well
established that the substitution of the lipid A phosphates with
Ara4N or PEtN limits the interaction of polymyxins with the bacte-
rial surface, thereby mediating resistance (Olaitan et al, 2014b), the
role of 2-hydroxymyristate remains unknown. Nonetheless, it is
becoming evident that the presence of hydroxyl groups in the lipid
A provides a competitive advantage in the presence of antimicrobial
peptides (Hankins et al, 2011; Llobet et al, 2015). The fact that
other Gram-negative pathogens (Salmonella, Legionella, Acinetobac-
ter, Pseudomonas) also synthesise lipid A species possessing a
hydroxyl group on a secondary acyl chain (Kulshin et al, 1991;
Zahringer et al, 1995; Gibbons et al, 2000; Beceiro et al, 2011) could
indicate that this lipid A modification is a conserved mechanism to
counteract antimicrobial peptides. It is beyond the scope of this
work to precisely define the molecular mechanism underlying
2-hydroxymyristate-dependent colistin resistance. However, it has
been argued by Nikaido and co-workers that LpxO-dependent lipid
A modification may increase the H bonding between neighbouring
LPS molecules, thereby limiting polymyxins-triggered self-promoted
pathway (Hancock et al, 1981; Nikaido, 2003).
Our work also highlights a connection between virulence and
antimicrobial resistance. mgrB mutants were hypervirulent in the
G. mellonella infection model even if the immunity of larvae was
boosted prior to infection. Recently, we reported that following
innate
immune
induction,
the
haemolymph
of
G. mellonella
contains antimicrobials which inhibited K. pneumoniae growth
(Insua et al, 2013). It was then plausible to speculate that the
heightened virulence of the mgrB mutant was due to its increased
resistance to antimicrobial peptides. Indeed, we demonstrate that
mgrB mutation confers resistance to the G. mellonella antimicro-
bial peptides. Notably, to restore the virulence of the mgrB mutant
to wild-type levels, it was necessary to mutate all loci responsible
for the lipid A modifications (Fig 2E). However, since in a previ-
ous work, we demonstrated that these individual mutants are
already attenuated in G. mellonella, it is possible that there are
additional, as yet unknown, MgrB-controlled factor(s) playing a
role in Galleria virulence (Insua et al, 2013). At present, we can
only speculate which are these factors. Recent transcriptional pro-
filing analysis of six mgrB mutants revealed the upregulation of
the several loci of the PhoPQ regulon but also the increased
expression of two additional two-component regulatory systems,
RstAB and CrrAB (Wright et al, 2015). Whereas the RstB sensor
has been shown to control the expression of PhoP-regulated genes,
there is no data on the CrrAB regulon and whether this system
contributes to K. pneumoniae virulence. Future research efforts
will be directed to understand the role of these systems in Kleb-
siella pathogenesis.
We demonstrated no impact of the mgrB mutation on the capac-
ity of K. pneumoniae to establish pulmonary and systemic infection
in the pneumonia mouse model. This finding is in contrast to the
hypervirulence phenotype observed in G. mellonella, but this most
likely reflects the complexity of mammalian models showing a more
complex innate immune response dependent on several cell types.
Nevertheless, in the setting of an immunocompromised host (e.g.
ICU patient) coupled with increased AMP resistance, it is feasible
that mgrB inactivation may play a role in the early establishment of
infection, pathogenicity and subsequent patient outcomes. Support-
ing this notion, isolation of colistin-resistant strains has been associ-
ated with death in septic patients with K. pneumoniae infection
(Falcone et al, 2016).
Another novel finding of this work is that the mgrB mutant
elicited limited activation of inflammatory responses in vitro and
in vivo (G. mellonella model). This is particularly relevant since
more than two decades of research have established the critical
importance
of
a
controlled
inflammatory
response
to
clear
K. pneumoniae infection. Therefore, the reduced response induced
by the mgrB mutant could be considered another feature of
increased
virulence
associated
with
this
mutation.
Strikingly,
mgrB-dependent attenuation of G. mellonella defence responses
was solely dependent on LpxO-mediated lipid A modification.
This is in perfect agreement with our recent work demonstrating
that
Klebsiella
LPS
containing
2-hydroxymyristate
is
less
inflammatory than that lacking this modification (Llobet et al,
2015). In contrast, our data revealed that mgrB-mediated attenua-
tion of inflammatory responses in macrophages was dependent on
all four lipid A modifications. This reflects the complex interac-
tion between K. pneumoniae and macrophages and is in good
agreement with published evidence demonstrating the non-redun-
dant contribution of Klebsiella lipid A modifications to limit
phagocytosis
by
professional
phagocytes
(macrophages
and
amoeba; March et al, 2013). MAPKs play a crucial role in govern-
ing immune responses, thereby highlighting the relevance of
attenuating their activation by the mgrB mutant (Dong et al,
2002). Current evidence shows that JNK and ERK regulate the
induction of inflammatory responses and production of defensins,
two
crucial
host
defence
responses
against
K. pneumoniae
(Moranta et al, 2010), and in this work, we have shown that
inactivation of mgrB resulted in limited activation of both MAPKs.
Nonetheless, there is still limited understanding of which MAPKs-
governed responses are crucial against K. pneumoniae infections.
Future studies will be directed to identify these responses.
To explain how mgrB-controlled lipid A limits the activation of
inflammatory responses, it is reasonable to postulate that this exten-
sively modified lipid A is not recognised by the TLR4/MD-2 LPS
receptor complex. The work of Park and co-workers predicts that
the hepta-acylated lipid A containing palmitate will not be accom-
modated within the active site of its MD-2 receptor, hence blocking
the subsequent dimerisation of TLR4 (Park et al, 2009). In addition,
the substitution of the lipid A phosphates with Ara4N or PEtN
should affect the receptor–ligand interaction since the lipid A 1- and
40-phosphate groups interact with a cluster of positively charged
residues from TLR4 and MD-2 (Park et al, 2009). To rigorously vali-
date these predictions, it will be necessary to assess individually all
these lipid A species with and without their various modifications.
The elegant synthetic biology approach described by Stephen
Trent’s group (Needham et al, 2013) engineering of E. coli to
produce each of the lipid A variants may provide a means for
comparing the different lipid As.
In general, it is accepted that antibiotic resistance most often
confers a cost in terms of subdued bacterial fitness and virulence
(Beceiro et al, 2013). Previous studies also illustrate that microbial
immune-evasive strategies contribute to the development and
persistence of antimicrobial resistance (Needham & Trent, 2013; De
Majumdar et al, 2015). Here, we have demonstrated a divergent

 scenario whereby an antimicrobial resistance mechanism helps to
counteract the activation of immune defences and enhance viru-
lence. Overall, this evidence stresses the importance of considering
antimicrobial resistance and virulence together, while also highlight-
ing the urgent need to include the identification of virulent clones in
clinical microbiology laboratories.
Finally, it is worthwhile discussing the clinical consequences
and implications of our findings. Limited therapeutic options to
treat MDR Gram-negative pathogens, in particular Pseudomonas
aeruginosa,
Acinetobacter
baumannii
and
K. pneumoniae,
led
clinicians to reappraise the clinical application of colistin. This
antibiotic is increasingly being used in endemic areas for KPC-
producing K. pneumoniae, but reports of colistin-resistant isolates
in that species are on the rise (Tzouvelekis et al, 2012; Olaitan
et al, 2014b; Nation et al, 2015). The evidence presented in this
work indicates that inactivation of mgrB results in colistin resis-
tance, but also enhances K. pneumoniae virulence. The latter
finding is particularly alarming because a large number of Kleb-
siella strains resistant to colistin carry alterations of the mgrB
gene (Lippa & Goulian, 2009; Cannatelli et al, 2013; Olaitan et al,
2014a; Poirel et al, 2015; Wright et al, 2015; Zowawi et al, 2015).
In fact, the heightened virulence of these strains might be one of
the explanations underlying the increased mortality associated
with these infections (Capone et al, 2013). Physicians should be
aware of such an occurrence for its implications on treatment and
outcome. This evidence further stresses the importance of careful
consideration of colistin therapies, at least for Klebsiella infec-
tions. In this context, we put forward the need to perform well-
designed clinical trials to inform antibiotic regimens for treating
infections caused by KPC-Klebsiella.
Materials and Methods
Ethics statement
The experiments involving mice were approved by the Queen’s
University Belfast’s Ethics Committee and conducted in accordance
with the UK Home Office regulations (Project Licence PPL2700).
Female C57BL/6 mice (8–9 weeks of age) were mock-infected with
PBS (n = 4) and infected with the wild-type strain (n = 6) or the mgrB
mutant (n = 6). Animals were randomised for interventions, but
researchers processing the samples and analysing the data were aware
which intervention group corresponded to which cohort of animals.
Bacterial strains and growth conditions
Bacterial strains and plasmids used in this study are presented in
Appendix Table S3. Kp52145 is a clinical isolate, serotype O1:K2,
belonging to the virulent CC65 clonal complex (Brisse et al, 2009;
Lery et al, 2014). Six previously published clinical K. pneumoniae
strains (T1a, T1b, C21, C22, C2 and 15I5) were supplied by Prof.
Patrice Nordmann, University of Fribourg, Switzerland (Poirel et al,
2015). Bacteria were grown in LB medium at 37°C, and where
appropriate, antibiotics were supplemented at the following concen-
trations:ampicillin(Amp)100 lg/ml,trimethoprim(Tmp)100 lg/ml,
tetracycline (Tet) 12.5 lg/ml, chloramphenicol (Cm) 25 lg/ml, kana-
mycin(Km)50 lg/mlandcarbenicillin(Cb)50 lg/ml.
Mutagenesis of K. pneumoniae 52145
PCR primers used for the mgrB mutant construction were designed
using the whole genome sequence of Kp52145 (GenBank Accession
No. FO834906.1; Appendix Table S3). The primer pairs mgrB_
UPFWD,
mgrB_UPRVS,
mgrB_DWNFWD
and
mgrB_DWNRVS
(Appendix Table S4) were used in separate PCR reactions to amplify
550- to 800-bp fragments flanking the mgrB gene. BamHI restriction
sites internal to these flanking regions were incorporated at the end
of each amplicon. Purified mgrB UP and DOWN fragments were
then polymerised and amplified as a single PCR amplicon using the
primers mgrB_UPFWD and mgrB_DWNRVS. This 1.4-kb PCR ampli-
con was then cloned into pGEM-T Easy (Promega) to obtain
pGEMDmgrB and transformed into E. coli C600. After EcoRI diges-
tion, the purified 1.4-kb fragment was cloned into EcoRI-digested
Antarctic Phosphatase (New England Biolabs)-treated pGPI-SceI-2
suicide vector (Aubert et al, 2014) to generate pGPI-SceI-2DmgrB
and transformed into E. coli GT115 (or SY327). pGPI-SceI-2DmgrB
was thereafter transformed into the diaminopimelate (DAP) auxo-
trophic E. coli donor strain b2163 (Demarre et al, 2005) and mobi-
lised into K. pneumoniae via conjugation. Selection of co-integrant
clones was undertaken using LB agar supplemented with Tmp at
37°C. A second crossover reaction was then performed by conjugat-
ing the pDAI-SceI-SacB plasmid (Aubert et al, 2014) into a refreshed
overnight
culture
containing
three
Tmp-resistant
co-integrant
clones. Exconjugants were selected on LB agar supplemented with
Tet at 37°C. Candidate mutant clones were checked for susceptibil-
ity to Tmp and then confirmed by PCR using the mgrB_UPFWD
and mgrB_DWNRVS primers. Curing of the pDAI-SceI-SacB vector
was performed by plating a refreshed overnight culture of one
K. pneumoniae mutant colony onto 6% sucrose LB agar without
NaCl at 30°C for 24 h. A single clone surviving the sucrose
treatment was checked for susceptibility to Tet, confirmed by PCR
and named 52145-DmgrB.
The 52145-DpmrC and 52145-DpagP mutants were constructed
by inserting a linearised pKD4-derived Km resistance cassette
(primers:
pmrC_FWD,
pmrC_RVS,
pagP_FWD
and
pagP_RVS,
accordingly; Appendix Table S4) into the relevant gene using the
lambda
Red
recombinase
method
and
pKOBEG-sacB
plasmid
(Datsenko & Wanner, 2000; Derbise et al, 2003). Km cassette
removal was undertaken by Flp-mediated recombination using the
pFLP2Tp plasmid (Hoang et al, 1998). The 52145-DpmrC and
52145-DpagP strains were confirmed by PCR using the primers
pmrC_checkFWD, pmrC_checkRVS, pagP_checkFWD and pagP_
checkRVS, accordingly (Appendix Table S4).
The double-mutant 52145-DmgrB-DphoQGB was obtained by
conjugating pMAKSACDphoPQGB into 52145-DmgrB as previously
described (Llobet et al, 2011). Double 52145-DpmrC-DmgrB and
52145-DpagP-DmgrB mutants were generated by conjugating pGPI-
SceIDmgrB into 52145-DpmrC and 52145-DpagP (Llobet et al, 2015),
respectively. The double 52145-DmgrB-DlpxO mutant was created
by conjugating pMAKSACDlpxO into 52145-DmgrB. The pMAK-
SACDlpxO vector was constructed in accordance with the previously
described mutagenesis strategy using DNA fragments amplified by
the
primers
lpxO_UPFWD,
lpxO_UPRVS,
lpxO_DWNFWD
and
lpxO_DWNRVS (Appendix Table S4; Llobet et al, 2011). The triple
52145-DpmrC-DlpxO-DmgrB mutant was generated by conjugating
the

pDAI-SceI-SacB plasmid methodology detailed for the mgrB mutant.
PCR fragments flanking the pmrAB, pmrF, pagP and manC genes
were
initially
generated
using
the
relevant
UPFWD,
UPRVS,
DWNFWD and DWNRVS primers (Appendix Table S4). Gene-specific
UPFWD and DWNRVS primers were used to generate DpmrAB,
DpmrF, DpagP and DmanC knockout fragments and confirm mutant
clones. pGPI-SceI-2DpmrAB, pGPI-SceI-2DpmrF, pGPI-SceI-2DpagP
and pGPI-SceI-2DmanC constructs were then conjugated with the
relevant 52145-wild-type and mutant precursor strains. Confirmation
of all mutants was undertaken by PCR.
Complementation of the 52145-DmgrB mutant
For complementation of the 52145-DmgrB mutant strain, a PCR
fragment (primers: mgrB_UPFWD and mgrB_DWNRVS) comprising
the coding and promoter regions of the K. pneumoniae 52145
mgrB gene was amplified using Phusion� High-Fidelity DNA
Polymerase (New England Biolabs). The 1,507-bp amplicon was
gel-purified and then cloned into SmaI-digested (New England
Biolabs), Antarctic Phosphatase (New England Biolabs)-treated
pUC18R6KT-mini-Tn7TKm plasmid (Choi et al, 2005) to obtain
pUC18R6KT-mini-Tn7TKm_Kp52145mgrBCom.
pUC18R6KT-mini-
Tn7TKm_Kp52145 mgrBCom was then transformed into E. coli
SY327 and thereafter into E. coli b2163. In addition, the trans-
posase-containing pTSNSK-Tp plasmid (Crepin et al, 2012) was
introduced to the 52145-DmgrB strain by electroporation to give
52145-DmgrB/pTSNSK-Tp.
52145-DmgrB/pTSNSK-Tp
was
then
conjugated
overnight
with
E. coli
b2163/pUC18R6KT-mini-
Tn7TKm_Kp52145mgrBCom on LB agar supplemented with DAP
at 30°C. The retrieved culture was then serially diluted in sterile
PBS, plated onto LB Km agar and incubated at 42°C for 6.5 h
followed by 37°C overnight. The colonies grown were thereafter
screened for resistance to Km and susceptibility to Tmp and Amp.
Correct integration of the Tn7 transposon was confirmed by PCR
using the primers KpnglmSup/Ptn7L and KpnglmSdown/Ptn7R
as previously described (March et al, 2013). Additionally, the
presence
of
the
mgrB
gene
was
PCR-confirmed
using
the
mgrB_UPFWD and mgrB_DWNRVS primers.
Complementation of the 52145-DmgrB-DphoQGB and
52145-DmgrB-DlpxO mutants
Complementation of the 52145-DmgrB-DphoQGB mutant with the
52145 phoPQ operon and 52145-DmgrB-DlpxO mutant with the 52145
lpxO gene was undertaken using pGP-Tn7-Cm_KpnPhoPQCom and
pGP-Tn7-Cm_KpnLpxOCom as previously described (Llobet et al,
2015). Complemented strains were identified by resistance to Cm,
susceptibility to Tmp and Amp, and PCR using the primers
PhoPQ_ checkFWD, PhoPQ_checkRVS, lpxO_checkFWD and lpxO_
checkRVS, accordingly (Appendix Table S4). Correct Tn7 integration
was PCR-confirmed using the KpnglmSup/Ptn7L and KpnglmSdown/
Ptn7R primer sets (March et al, 2013).
Growth curve analysis
For growth analyses, 5 ll of overnight cultures was diluted in
250 ll of LB or M9 minimal medium (5× M9 minimal salts [Sigma-
Aldrich] supplemented with 2% glucose, 3 mM thiamine, 2 mM
MgSO4) and incubated at 37°C with continuous, normal shaking in
a Bioscreen C
TM Automated Microbial Growth Analyzer (MTX Lab
Systems, Vienna, VA, USA). Optical density (OD; 600 nm) was
measured and recorded every 20 min.
Biofilm analysis
Biofilms were assayed using a variation of the standard crystal-
violet quantification assay. Overnight cultures were grown for 16 h
in 5 ml LB broth, after which each strain was diluted to an OD600
of 0.02 in freshly prepared M9 minimal media (5× M9 minimal salts
[Sigma-Aldrich] supplemented with 2% glucose, 3 mM thiamine,
2 mM MgSO4). 100 ll of each diluted strain was then added to two
columns (12 internal wells) of a polystyrene U-bottomed 96-well
plate (Greiner Bio-One), and the plate was incubated statically at
37°C for 24 h. Wells were stained with the addition of 25 ll of
0.5% crystal violet (Sigma-Aldrich) to each well for 1 h. The plates
were washed by submersion in distilled H2O, and the crystal violet
in each well was dissolved in 150 ll 95% ethanol for 1 h. Biofilms
were then quantified by measuring the optical density at 595 nm of
each well. Three independent cultures of each strain were tested
per day, and the data shown are the average of three independent
days.
Polymyxin and antimicrobial peptide susceptibility assays
MICs to colistin sulphate and polymyxin B were determined by
Etest� (bioMe
´rieux) using the European Committee on Antimicro-
bial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) breakpoints for colistin (the
European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing, 2016).
To assay K. pneumoniae strains for resistance to polymyxin
antibiotics and AMPs, we used a modified version of the sensitivity
assay described by Llobet et al (2011). Briefly, each strain was
grown to early exponential phase in LB broth, washed once in PBS
and diluted in liquid testing media (1% v/v Tryptone soy broth,
10% v/v 100 mM phosphate buffer [pH 6.5], 2% v/v 5 M NaCl) to
an approximate concentration of 4 × 104 colony-forming units
(CFUs) per millilitre. Twenty-five microlitres of each diluted strain
was then mixed with 5 ll of antibiotic (or AMP) and incubated at
37°C for 1 h. Fifteen microlitres of the suspension was thereafter
spread onto LB agar and incubated overnight at 37°C. Per cent
survival of the cells exposed to the antibiotics (or AMPs) was deter-
mined through comparison with the unexposed (sterile PBS)
controls.
Lipid A isolation and mass spectrometry
Lipid A was extracted using the ammonium hydroxide/isobutyric
acid method described earlier (El Hamidi et al, 2005). Negative ion
MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry analysis (Bruker Daltonics) of the
samples was undertaken using an equal volume of dihydroxyben-
zoic acid matrix (Sigma-Aldrich) dissolved in (1:2) acetonitrile-0.1%
trifluoroacetic acid.

 Generation of the lucFF reporter fusion K. pneumoniae strains
An 868-bp amplicon comprising the pagP gene promoter region was
amplified by Phusion� High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase using the
primers pagP_Pro_FWD and pagP_Pro_RVS (Appendix Table S4).
The amplicon was digested with EcoRI, gel-purified, cloned into an
EcoRI-SmaI-digested pGPL01 suicide vector and then transformed
into E. coli GT115 cells to obtain pGPLKpnProPagP. Correct inser-
tion of the amplicon was verified by restriction digestions with
EcoRI and HindIII.
pGPLKpnProPhoP,
pGPLKpnProLpxO,
pGPLKpnProPmrH,
pGPLKpnProPmrC, pGPLKpnProPagP and pGPLKpnProcps (Llobet
et al, 2011, 2015; Insua et al, 2013) were each introduced into
E. coli b2163 and then mobilised into the Kp52145, 52145-DmgrB,
52145-DmgrBCom and 52145-DmgrB-DphoQGB strains via conjuga-
tion. Cultures were then serially diluted and checked for Amp resis-
tance by plating on LB Cb agar at 37°C. Correct insertion of the
vectors into the chromosome was confirmed by PCR using the rele-
vant
lucFF_check
and
promoter
sequence
primers
(Appendix
Table S4; data not shown).
Luciferase activity
Overnight cultures of the K. pneumoniae reporter strains were
refreshed for 2.5 h in LB containing Cb at 37°C and 180 rpm. The
cells were then pelleted, washed once in sterile PBS and adjusted to
an OD600 of 1.0. One hundred microlitres of each suspension was
added to an equal volume of luciferase assay reagent (1 mM D-luci-
ferin [Synchem] in 100 mM sodium citrate buffer pH 5.0), vortexed
for 5 s and then immediately measured for luminescence (expressed
as relative light units [RLU]) using a GloMax 20/20 Luminometer
(Promega). All strains were tested in triplicate from three indepen-
dent cultures.
G. mellonella larvae and infections
G. mellonella larvae were obtained from UK Waxworms Limited.
Upon receipt, larvae were stored in reduced light at 13°C with nil
dietary supplementation. All experiments were performed within
14 days of receipt comprising larvae showing a healthy external
appearance of 250–350 mg weight as previously described (Insua
et al, 2013).
K.
pneumoniae
strains
for
G. mellonella
infections
were
prepared by harvesting refreshed 5 ml of exponential phase LB
cultures (37°C, 180 rpm, 2.5 h), washing once in sterile PBS
and then adjusting to an OD600 of 1.0 (i.e. ~5 × 108 CFUs/ml).
Each suspension was thereafter diluted to the desired working
concentration (i.e. ~1 × 107 and 1 × 108 CFUs/ml). Larvae were
surface-disinfected with 70% (v/v) ethanol and then injected
with 10 ll of working bacterial suspension at the right last
proleg using a Hamilton syringe equipped with a 27-gauge
needle. Experiments involving dual injections were undertaken
in the right and then the left proleg. For each experiment, 10
larvae injected with sterile PBS were included as combined
trauma and vehicle controls. Injected larvae were placed inside
Petri dishes at 37°C in the dark. Per cent survival following
gentle physical stimulation was recorded at 24-h intervals over
72 h.
G. mellonella killing assay
Based on earlier 50% lethal dose (LD50) data, the virulence of each
K. pneumoniae 52145 strain was explored using a working concen-
tration of ~1 × 105 CFUs per larvae (Insua et al, 2013). For
G. mellonella infections using the K. pneumoniae T1a and T1b ST-
258 clinical strains, an infection dose of ~2 × 105 per larvae was
used (Poirel et al, 2015). Insects were considered dead if they did
not respond to physical stimuli. Larvae were examined for pigmen-
tation, and time of death was recorded. Assays were allowed to
proceed for only 3 days as pupa formation was occasionally
observed by day 4. A total of 40 larvae over three independent
experiments were investigated for each strain.
G. mellonella with boosted immunity killing assay
Larvae were injected with ~1 × 106 CFUs of heat-killed (65°C,
20 min) E. coli MG1655 to elicit the production of antimicrobial
factors (Insua et al, 2013). After 24 h of incubation at 37°C, larvae
were then infected with 1 × 106 CFUs of selected K. pneumoniae
52145 strains (n = 30 larvae/group over three independent experi-
ments) and returned to 37°C for 72 h. Per cent survival was
recorded at 24-h intervals.
Radial diffusion bioassay to assess G. mellonella
antimicrobial peptides
We used a previously described radial diffusion assay to assess
the in vitro resistance of the K. pneumoniae 52145 strains to
antimicrobial factors produced by G. mellonella (Insua et al, 2013).
Briefly, production of G. mellonella antimicrobial factors was elicited
through injection of ~1 × 106 CFUs of heat-killed E. coli MG1655.
After 24 h of incubation at 37°C, 15 ll of haemolymph from three
surface-disinfected larvae was pooled with 10 ll of saturated N-
phenylthiourea (Sigma-Aldrich). Ten microlitres of each haemolymph
preparation (or sterile H2O) was then inoculated into the wells of
radial diffusion underlay gels containing either 52145, 52145-DmgrB
or 52145-DmgrBCom. Plates were incubated at 37°C for 3 h, over-
layed with 1% agarose containing 6% TSB powder and returned to
37°C for 18 h. Zones of inhibition were measured and expressed as
inhibition units (10 units = 1 mm). Haemolymph samples from
larvae injected with sterile PBS were used as uninfected controls.
Colistin sulphate and polymyxin B (20 lg/ml) plus sterile H2O were
used as positive and negative bioassay controls, respectively.
G. mellonella RNA extraction and quantitative real-time
PCR analysis
Larvae were infected with ~1 × 105 CFUs of the selected K. pneumo-
niae 52145 strains, incubated at 37°C for 8 h and then homogenised
in 1 ml ice-cold TRIzol (Ambion
TM) using a VDI 12 tissue homoge-
niser (VWR). Total RNA was extracted according the manufacturer’s
instructions with minor modifications including the use of Phase
Lock Gel Heavy 2-ml tubes (VWR) for phase separation. Five micro-
grams of RNA was treated with recombinant DNase I (Roche Diag-
nostics Ltd) at 37°C for 30 min and then purified using a standard
phenol–chloroform method and Phase Lock Gel Heavy 1.5-ml tubes
(VWR). The RNA was precipitated overnight with 20 ll 3 M sodium

 acetate (pH 5.2) and 600 ll 98% (v/v) ethanol at �20°C, washed
twice in 75% (v/v) ethanol, dried and then resuspended in RNase-
free H2O. Duplicate cDNA preparations from each sample were
generated from 1 lg of RNA using Moloney murine leukaemia virus
(M-MLV) reverse transcriptase (Sigma-Aldrich) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis of
G. mellonella antimicrobial peptide expression was undertaken
using the KAPA SYBR� FAST qPCR Kit, previously described
oligonucleotide primers (Insua et al, 2013) and Stratagene Mx3005P
qPCR System (Agilent Technologies). Thermal cycling conditions
were as follows: 95°C for 3 min for enzyme activation, 40 cycles of
denaturation at 95°C for 10 s and annealing at 60°C for 20 s. cDNA
samples were tested in duplicate, and relative mRNA quantity was
determined by the comparative threshold cycle (DDCt) method using
18S rRNA normalisation.
Capsule polysaccharide purification and quantification
Bacteria were grown overnight in 3 ml of LB medium (37°C,
180 rpm) with viable counts determined by dilution plating. The
cultures were then harvested by centrifugation, and the cell pellet
was resuspended in 500 ll of sterile H2O. Each sample was then
treated with 1% 3-(N,N-dimethyltetradecylammonio)propanesul-
phonate (Sigma-Aldrich; in 100 mM citric acid, pH 2.0) at 50°C for
20 min. Bacterial debris was pelleted (3,220 × g, 10 min), and
250 ll of the supernatant was transferred to a clean 15-ml glass
tube. The CPS was thereafter ethanol-precipitated at �20°C for
20 min and pelleted (9,447 × g, 10 min, 4°C). After removal of the
supernatant, the pellet was then dried (5 min, 90°C) and resus-
pended in 200 ll of sterile water. CPS quantification was under-
taken by determining the concentration of uronic acid in the
samples, using a modified carbazole assay as previously described
(Rahn & Whitfield, 2003). All samples were tested in triplicate.
Intranasal murine infection model
Female mice were infected intranasally with ~3 × 105 Kp52145 and
52145-DmgrB in 30 ll PBS (n = 6 per strain). Control mice were inoc-
ulated with 30 ll sterile PBS (n = 4). After 24 h, mice were eutha-
nised using a Schedule 1 method according to UK Home Office-
approved protocols. Left lung samples from infected and uninfected
control mice were immersed in 1 ml of RNA stabilisation solution
(50% [w/v] ammonium sulphate [Fisher Scientific], 2.9% [v/v] 0.5
M ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid [Sigma-Aldrich], 1.8% [v/v] 1 M
sodium citrate [Sigma-Aldrich]) on ice and then stored at 4°C for at
least 24 h prior to RNA extraction. Right lung, spleen and NALT
samples from infected mice were immersed in 1 ml sterile PBS on ice
and processed for quantitative bacterial culture immediately. Samples
were homogenised using a VDI 12 tissue homogeniser, serially
diluted in sterile PBS and plated onto Salmonella Shigella agar (Oxoid
Limited), and the colonies were enumerated after overnight incuba-
tion at 37°C. Data were expressed as CFUs per sample.

Left lung samples for RNA extraction were removed from RNA
stabilisation
solution,
homogenised
in
1 ml
ice-cold
TRIzol
(Ambion
TM) using a VDI 12 tissue homogeniser and then subjected
to five rounds of bead beating for 10 s followed by ice-cooling for
1 min using 100-lm acid-washed glass beads (Sigma-Aldrich) and a
Mini-Beadbeater-1 (BioSpec Products). RNA was extracted, and
duplicate cDNA preparations were generated from each sample
using the protocol described for the infected G. mellonella samples.
Quantitative real-time PCR analysis of inflammatory cytokine and
murine antimicrobial peptide expression was undertaken using the
KAPA SYBR� FAST qPCR Kit, previously described oligonucleotide
primers (Appendix Table S4) and Stratagene Mx3005P qPCR System
(Agilent Technologies). Thermal cycling conditions were as follows:
95°C for 3 min for enzyme activation, 40 cycles of denaturation at
95°C for 10 s and annealing at 60°C for 20 s. Each cDNA sample
was tested in duplicate, and relative mRNA quantity was deter-
mined by the comparative threshold cycle (DDCt) method using
hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase 1 (mHprt) gene normalisa-
tion.
Cell culture and infections
Immortalised BMDM (iBMDM) cells (BEI Resources, NIAID, NIH:
Macrophage Cell Line Derived from Wild Type Mice, NR-9456)
were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM;
Gibco� 41965) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated foetal calf
serum (FCS), 100 U/ml penicillin and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin
(Gibco) at 37°C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator. Murine alveo-
lar macrophages MH-S (ATCC, CRL-2019) were grown in RPMI
1640 tissue culture medium supplemented with 10% heat-inacti-
vated foetal calf serum (FCS), 100 U/ml penicillin, 0.1 mg/ml
streptomycin
(Gibco),
and
10 mM
HEPES
(Sigma-Aldrich).
iBMDMs and MH-S were grown at 37°C in humidified 5% CO2
atmospheric conditions. Cells were routinely tested for Myco-
plasma contamination.
For infections, bacteria were adjusted to an OD600 of 1.0 in PBS,
and infections were performed using a multiplicity of infection of
100 bacteria per cell. To synchronise infection, plates were centri-
fuged at 200 × g for 5 min.
Immunoblot analysis
Proteins were resolved by standard 10% SDS–PAGE and elec-
troblotted
onto
nitrocellulose
membranes.
Membranes
were
blocked with 4% bovine serum albumin (w/v) in TBST, and
protein bands were detected with specific antibodies using chemi-
luminescence reagents and a G:BOX Chemi XRQ chemilumines-
cence imager (Syngene).
The following rabbit antibodies were used: anti-IjBa (1:1,000;
Cell Signaling), anti-phospho-p38 (1:1,000; Cell Signaling), anti-
phospho-SAPK/JNK (1:1,000; Cell Signaling) and anti-phospho-ERK
(1:1,000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Immunoreactive bands were
visualised by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated
goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulins (1:5,000) or goat anti-mouse
immunoglobulins (1:1,000; Bio-Rad). To ensure that equal amounts
of proteins were loaded, blots were re-probed with a-tubulin
(1:3,000; Sigma-Aldrich).
To detect multiple proteins, membranes were re-probed after
stripping of previously used antibodies using a pH 2.2 glycine-HCl/
SDS buffer.

 Quantification of cytokines
Infections were performed in 96-well plates (5 × 104 cells per well)
using 1 × 105 UV-killed bacteria (1 ml of bacterial suspension
adjusted to an OD600 of 1.0 was subjected to 10 J UV light for
30 min, and bacterial killing was confirmed by plating in LB). TNF-
a in the supernatants was determined at 6 h of infection using a
Murine TNF-a Standard TMB ELISA Development Kit (PeproTech,

instructions. Experiments were performed in duplicate and repeated
at least three times.
Statistical analyses
Statistical analyses were performed using the two-tailed t-test, or
when the requirements were not met, by the Mann–Whitney U-test.
P-values of < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Normal-

The paper explained
Problem
The emergence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) K. pneumoniae is an
important public health challenge worldwide. Of particular concern is
the recent appearance of MDR K. pneumoniae strains that develop
colistin resistance following treatment with this last-line antibiotic
agent. Several studies have shown that the development of colistin
resistance is often associated with mutational inactivation of the
mgrB gene. However, the precise mechanisms governing the colistin
resistance observed in these organisms are poorly understood. More-
over, it is currently unknown whether mgrB mutation confers any loss
of virulence. This is particularly critical given the increasing number
of K. pneumoniae infections caused by virulent clones and the ease
with which mgrB mutations arise in the hospital setting.
Results
Here, we constructed and characterised an mgrB mutant in a clini-
cally relevant K. pneumoniae strain. Our data show that mgrB inacti-
vation results in bacterial outer membrane modifications, which not
only confers resistance to colistin, but also to host defence peptides
produced by the body to help combat infection. Surprisingly, mgrB
mutation substantially increased K. pneumoniae virulence in an estab-
lished invertebrate infection model, and its survival was not compro-
mised in the mouse. Our data also indicate that this virulence
phenotype may be linked to subdued host immune system activation
during the early infection.
Impact
Our findings have important implications for the management of
patients with MDR K. pneumoniae. In the clinical settings such as
intensive care units, it is feasible that mgrB inactivation may play a
role in the early infection establishment, pathogenicity and patient
outcomes. This reinforces the importance of considering antimicrobial
resistance and virulence together, while also highlighting the impor-
tance of microbiological surveillance for virulent clones in healthcare
settings. Further, our findings stress that care is required in the use of
colistin against infections caused by K. pneumoniae.
