Research in context 
 
Evidence before this study 
Safe, accessible and affordable surgery is a global health priority. It is estimated that 5 billion people do not have access 
to safe and affordable surgery, whilst an additional 143 million surgeries each year are needed in low and middle-
income countries (LMICs) to address this need. However, there are limited surgical outcomes data from LMICs, and 
particularly few data from Africa. Two recent observational cohort studies only included a small number of African 
countries, with a limited range of surgeries reported. Increasing access to surgery is a priority in Africa, however it is 
essential to ensure that the surgery is safe, and that unnecessary perioperative morbidity and mortality is prevented. 
Because of the limited data of surgical outcomes data in Africa, there is an urgent need for a robust epidemiological 
study of perioperative patient outcomes to inform the global surgery initiative. 
 
Added value of this study 
The African Surgical Outcomes Study provides data from 25 African countries for all in-patient surgeries. One in five 
surgical patients in Africa develops a perioperative complication, following which, one in ten patients will die. Our 
findings show that, despite being younger with a low risk profile, and lower complication rates, patients in Africa are 
twice as likely to die following surgery when compared with outcomes at a global level. African surgical hospitals are 
under-resourced with a median combined total of specialist surgeons, obstetricians and anaesthesiologists of 0.7 
([25th/75th centile] 0.2-1.9) per 100,000 population, far below the recommended number identified by the Lancet 
Commission on Global Surgery. The volume of surgical procedures is also very low at 212 (65-578) procedures per 
100,000 population each year. Most surgical procedures are performed on an urgent or emergency basis, and one third 
are Caesarean deliveries. Importantly, 95% of deaths occur after surgery, indicating the need to improve the safety of 
perioperative care.  
 
Implications of all the available evidence 
Previous studies have provided only limited data on surgical outcomes in Africa, through limited country participation 
and inclusion of selected surgical procedures. The African Surgical Outcomes Study provides a detailed insight into this 
problem. Our findings suggest a high incidence of potentially avoidable deaths amongst low-risk surgical patients, 
largely due to a failure to identify and treat life-threatening complications in the perioperative period. Limited 
availability of human and hospital resources may be a key factor. Despite the positive impact of the global safe surgery 
campaign, our findings show that surgical outcomes will remain poor in Africa, until the perioperative care of patients 
with deteriorating physiological function is addressed, and sufficient resources are available to provide this care. A 
  
5 
continent-wide quality improvement strategy to promote effective perioperative care may save many lives after surgery 
in Africa.

Abstract  
 
Background 
There is a need to increase access to surgical treatments in African countries, but perioperative complications represent 
a major global healthcare burden. There are few data describing surgical outcomes in Africa.  
 
Methods 
Seven-day, international, prospective, observational cohort study of patients ≥18 years undergoing in-patient surgery in 
Africa. The primary outcome was in-hospital postoperative complications. The secondary outcome was in-hospital 
mortality. Data are presented as median (25th/75th centile) and n (%). 
 
Findings 
11422 patients were recruited from 247 hospitals during the national cohort weeks between February and May 2016 in 
25 African countries. Hospitals served a median population of 810,000 (200,000 - 2,000,000) people, with a combined 
number of specialist surgeons, obstetricians and anaesthetists totalling 0.7 (0.2-1.9) per 100,000 population. Hospitals 
recruited 29 (10-70) patients, equivalent to 212 (65-578) surgical procedures per 100,000 population each year. Patients 
were younger (38·5 [16·1] years), with a lower risk profile (American Society of Anesthesiologists score 1 [1-2]) than 
reported in high income countries. 1253 (11·0%) patients were infected with human immunodeficiency virus. 6504 
procedures (57%) were urgent or emergent. The most common procedure was Caesarean delivery (3792 patients, 33%). 
Complications occurred in 1977/10885 (18·2%) patients but overall mortality was more than twice the global average 
(239/11193 [2·1%]), with 225/239 (94·1%) deaths occurring after the day of surgery. Infection was the commonest 
complication (1156/10970, 10·2%) with 112 deaths (9·7%). Complications were associated with prolonged hospital 
stay (3 [2-5] days vs 6 [4-13] days; p<0·001).  
 
Interpretation 
Despite a low risk profile and low complication rates, patients in Africa are twice as likely to die after surgery when 
compared to the global average. Initiatives to increase access to surgical treatments in Africa, must be coupled with 
improved surveillance for deteriorating physiology amongst patients who develop postoperative complications and the 
resources necessary to achieve this objective.

Introduction 
The surgical population represents a major global health burden with more than 300 million surgical procedures 
performed annually,1 and an early postoperative mortality of up to 4%.2,3 However, it has been estimated that 5 billion 
people are unable to access safe surgical treatments,4 94% of whom live in low and middle-income countries (LMICs).4 
Estimates suggest that globally, an additional 143 million surgical procedures are required each year, many of which are 
in Africa.4 Surgery is a cost-effective and core component of universal health coverage,5,67 but it needs to be safe.4 
Known barriers to the provision of safe surgical treatment in Africa include low hospital procedural volumes,8 low 
numbers of hospital beds,9 and a paucity of operating theatres,10 all of which are compounded by the geographical 
remoteness of many surgical hospitals and a lack of adequately trained staff.11,12 The Lancet Commission on Global 
Surgery was established to develop strategies for safe, accessible and affordable surgical care, but implementation of 
this strategy requires robust epidemiological data describing patterns of surgical activity and subsequent patient 
outcomes.7,13  
 
Data describing surgical outcomes in Africa are particularly limited, and the findings of international studies are 
dominated by activity in high-income countries, with little participation from African countries.9,14 Furthermore, few 
African countries have national registries or audit systems to monitor surgical procedures and subsequent outcomes. 
Low Human Development Index (HDI) countries, many of which are African, are believed to have significantly higher 
perioperative mortality but this remains unconfirmed.14,15 The effect of population disease burden on the pattern of 
surgical outcomes in Africa is also unknown. Compared to high income countries, there is a preponderance of 
communicable diseases and injuries,14,16-18 of which human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is the leading cause of life 
years lost in Africa.18  
 
To improve both the provision and quality of surgical treatments in Africa, we need a detailed understanding of the 
volume of surgical treatments currently performed, the surgical resources available, and the associated patient 
outcomes.4 The objective of the African Surgical Outcomes Study (ASOS) was to provide robust epidemiological data 
describing the volume of surgical activity, perioperative outcomes, and surgical workforce density in Africa, which are 
comparable to published international surgical outcomes data.9

Methods 
Study design 
This was a seven day, international multicentre prospective observational cohort study of patients ≥18 years undergoing 
any form of in-patient surgery in hospitals in African countries. This study was registered on the South African National 
Health Research Database (KZ_2015RP7_22), and on ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03044899). Our findings are reported in 
accordance with the STROBE statement.19 A collaborative network of over 1000 healthcare professionals was 
established across Africa, through personal invitations to colleagues, invitations to surgical and anaesthesia societies, a 
website (www.asos.org.za) and a twitter feed (@africansos). BMB made country visits where possible to meet with 
local study investigators. A website provided investigator support, in the form of a regularly updated ‘frequently asked 
questions’ webpage, the protocol, case report forms (CRFs), and an outcomes definitions document in English and 
French (www.asos.org.za). 
 
Setting and participants 
In each country, we aimed to recruit as many hospitals as possible using a convenience sampling strategy. For inclusion 
of country data in the study we required; i) data from at least 10 hospitals or at least half of the surgical centres, if fewer 
than 10 in the country, ii) submission of the total number of eligible patients during recruitment week, and iii) provision 
of data describing at least 90% of the eligible patients from each site. Each country selected a single recruitment week 
between February and May 2016. All patients undergoing elective and non-elective surgery with a planned overnight 
hospital stay following surgery during the study week were eligible for inclusion. Patients undergoing planned day 
surgery, or radiological procedures not requiring anaesthesia were excluded. Regulatory approval varied between 
countries, with some requiring ethics approval and others only data governance approval. The primary ethics approval 
was from the Biomedical Research Ethics Committee of the University of KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa (BE306/15). 
All sites approved a waiver of consent, except the University of the Witwatersrand, South Africa which required 
informed consent from all patients, with deferred consent for patients who could not give consent prior to surgery.  
 
Variables and data 
Hospital-specific data included the number of hospital beds, number of operating rooms, number of critical care beds, 
and numbers of anaesthetists, surgeons and obstetricians working in each hospital. We replicated the design of a recent 
global study, with an almost identical patient dataset to allow a direct comparison of surgical outcomes data from Africa 
with surgical outcomes at a global level.9,20 Complications were assessed according to predefined criteria and graded as 
mild, moderate or severe.20 Data describing consecutive patients were collected on paper case record forms until 
hospital discharge, censored at 30 days following surgery for patients who remained in hospital. Data were anonymised 
  
9 
during the transcription process using REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture) tools hosted by Safe Surgery South 
Africa. REDCap is a secure, web-based application designed to support data capture for research studies.21 Soft limits 
were set for data entry, prompting investigators when data were entered outside these limits. In countries with poor 
internet access, mobile phones were used for data entry, or CRFs were forwarded to BMB, for entry by Safe Surgery 
South Africa. National leaders confirmed the face validity of the unadjusted outcome data for their countries, and 
hospital level data were evaluated statistically to confirm plausibility.  
 
Outcome measures 
The primary outcome measure was in-hospital postoperative complications defined according to the consensus 
definitions by Jammer et al.20 The secondary outcome measure was in-hospital mortality. All outcomes were censored 
at 30 days for patients who remained in hospital. Outcomes data are presented at a national, regional (central, eastern, 
northern, southern, western African, and Indian Ocean Islands) and continental level. The outcomes definitions 
document is in the Supplementary Appendix. 
 
Statistical analysis 
There was no prespecified sample size, as the aim was to recruit as many hospitals as possible, and ideally every 
eligible patient from recruiting hospitals. We anticipated that a minimum sample size of 10,000 patients would provide 
a sufficient number of events for construction of a robust continental logistic regression model.22 Although this study 
can provide an estimate of continental mortality, it was not powered to detect differences in mortality between 
countries. During the process of hospital recruitment and data collection, we realised that our predefined criteria for 
including a national patient sample were too strict for many countries, despite formal acceptance by the national leaders 
of these requirements before the study began. Prior to analysis, we took the decision to present the data describing the 
full cohort, and include a per-protocol analysis of the predefined representative sample for comparison.  
 
Categorical variables are described as proportions and compared using Fisher’s exact test. Continuous variables are 
described as mean and standard deviation, or median and 25th/75th centile, and compared using t-tests. For country 
specific mortality comparison, we constructed a multivariable logistic model that included all potential risk factors 
associated with in-hospital mortality. These included; age, smoker status, gender, American Society of 
Anesthesiologists (ASA) category, preoperative chronic comorbid conditions (coronary artery disease, congestive heart 
failure, diabetes mellitus, cirrhosis, metastatic cancer, hypertension, stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, 
HIV, chronic renal disease), the type of surgery, urgency of surgery (elective, urgent or emergency) and the severity of 
surgery (minor, intermediate or major). To avoid collinearity of potential risk factors, variables with variance inflation 
factor >2 were excluded. For all analyses, we performed a complete case analysis, excluding patients with missing data 
  
10 
from the analysis. South Africa, the country with the largest number of observed events was used as the reference 
country. Orthopaedic surgery as the largest noncardiac, non-obstetric surgical category was used as surgical reference 
category. Restricted cubic splines were used to fit continuous variables.23 Model performances were evaluated by 
assessing the calibration and discrimination of the model. A smooth, nonparametric calibration line was created with the 
LOESS algorithm (i.e. a locally weighted scatterplot smoothing) to estimate the observed probabilities of in-hospital 
mortality in relation to the predicted probabilities. Discrimination was quantified by calculating the concordance 
statistic (c-statistic) completed with optimism,24 which relates to both model coefficients estimation and over-fitting 
(e.g. selection of predictors, categorization of continuous predictors). We conducted four sensitivity analyses of the 
association between preoperative risk factors and mortality. These included; i)  a per-protocol sensitivity analysis of 
only the patients from the hospitals which provided hospital facility data, ii) a full case sensitivity analysis, with 
multiple imputation of missing data to test for potential bias associated with missing variables,25 and iii) two further 
analyses which explored the effect of the hospital facility level or university-affiliation on mortality. In these two 
analyses, we either forced hospital facility level or university-affiliation into the model. Statistical analyses were 
performed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 24 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) and R 
statistical software package version 3.4 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Austria).    
 
Role of funding source 
The study was funded by an investigator initiated research grant from the Medical Research Council of South Africa 
awarded to BMB. The study website (www.asos.org.za) and the data repository was maintained by Safe Surgery South 
Africa and the South African Society of Anaesthesiologists. These organisations played no role in the study design, data 
acquisition, data analysis or writing of the paper. 
 
BMB, YLM and TME had full access to the data. BMB and RMP had responsibility for submission of the manuscript.

Results 
Country and hospital data 
247 hospitals participated in 25 African countries (Figures 1 and 2). These included 14 low-income countries (Benin, 
Burundi, Congo, Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Ethiopia, Gambia, Madagascar, Mali, Niger, Senegal, 
Tanzania, Togo, Uganda, and Zimbabwe) and 11 middle-income countries (Algeria, Cameroon, Egypt, Ghana, Kenya, 
Libya, Mauritius, Namibia, Nigeria, South Africa, and Zambia). Hospital level data were submitted for 216 of 247 
(87·4%) participating hospitals. 173/216 (80·1%) were government-funded hospitals, 28/216 (12·0%) privately funded, 
and 15/216 (6·9%) jointly funded hospitals. 103/212 (48·6%) were university-affiliated hospitals. 45/216 (20·8%) were 
primary-level hospitals (defined as mainly obstetrics and gynaecology and general surgery), 68/216 (31·4%) were 
secondary-level hospitals (defined as highly differentiated by function with 5 to 10 clinical specialities), and 103/216 
(47·7%) were tertiary-level (defined as specialised staff or technical support) hospitals.26 Each hospital served a median 
population of 880 000 (200000-2000000) people, with 300 (140-545) beds, 6 (2-7) operating rooms and 3 (0-7) critical 
care beds providing invasive ventilation. The ratio of critical care beds to hospital beds was 0·9% (0-2·0). Hospitals 
were staffed by 3 (1-8) specialist surgeons, 1 (0-5) specialist anaesthetists, and 2 (0-5) specialist obstetricians, with a 
median of 0·7 (0·2-1·9) of any specialist per 100,000 population. The median number of surgical procedures per 
hospital for the study week was 29 (10-71). 
 
Patient data 
11422 patients were recruited (Figure 2). The patient characteristics, perioperative complications and mortality are 
shown in Table 1. Most patients had a low perioperative risk profile. They were young (38·5 years [16·1]), with an 
American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status score of 1 [1-2]). The most common comorbidities were 
hypertension (1863 patients, 16·3%) and HIV (1253 patients, 11·0%). Most surgery was urgent or emergent 
(6504/11378, 57%). The most common procedure was Caesarean delivery (3792/11393, 33·3%). The World Health 
Organisation Safe Surgery Checklist or a similar surgical checklist was used in 6183/10836 (57·1%) of surgeries. 
 
Patient outcomes following surgery are shown in Table 2. There were 239 deaths after surgery (2·1%), only 14 (5·9%) 
of which occurred on the day of surgery.  The median time of death was 5 [2-11] days postoperatively. Postoperative 
complications occurred in 1977/10885 (18·2% [95% CI 17·4-18·9]), with a mortality of 188/1970 (9·5% [95% 8·2-
10·8%]). 321/1972 (16·3%) patients with postoperative complications were admitted to critical care to treat these 
complications, of whom 255/321 (79·4%) were admitted to critical care immediately after surgery. Complications were 
associated with prolonged hospital stay (3 [2-5] days vs 6 [4-13] days; p<0·001). Individual postoperative 
complications are shown in Table 3. Infectious complications were most common whilst cardiovascular complications 
  
12 
were associated with the highest mortality (110/190, 57·9%). Cardiac arrest was associated with a 101/113 (89·4%) in-
hospital mortality. The proportional contribution of non-communicable diseases, infection, trauma and caesarean 
delivery as the primary indication for surgery to mortality and postoperative complications is shown in Table 4. Non-
communicable diseases were the most common indication for surgery, however significantly more postoperative 
complications and death followed surgery for infection and trauma.  
 
The country specific data are shown in Supplementary Table 1. The model to describe mortality had poor 
discrimination for mortality (c-statistic corrected for optimism of 0·53, Brier of 0·0222 for mortality) when based on the 
countries alone. However, the adjusted model for country specific mortality showed good discrimination for mortality 
(c-statistic corrected for optimism of 0·83, Brier of 0·0222) (Supplementary Table 2). The calibration plot for in-
hospital mortality is shown in Supplementary Figure 1. After risk-adjustment, most countries had a similar risk of 
mortality. Postoperative mortality was strongly associated with increasing ASA grade, urgency of surgery, and grade of 
surgery (intermediate and major). Gastrointestinal, hepatobiliary and neurosurgery were associated with increased 
mortality.  
 
When compared to a recent global epidemiological study of elective surgery (International Surgical Outcomes Study, or 
ISOS),9 the elective surgical patients in the ASOS cohort were younger, had a lower risk profile, and underwent more 
minor surgery. Patients in ASOS experienced fewer postoperative complications (Supplementary Table 3). The 
comparison between the postoperative mortality, postoperative complications, and mortality following postoperative 
complications, after elective surgery in the ISOS high-income and LMICs, and the African countries of the ASOS 
cohort, is shown in Figure 3 and Supplementary Figure 2. Mortality amongst surgical patients in Africa was twice the 
global average represented by the ISOS cohort.  
 
The per-protocol analysis of the hospital data, patient data, patient outcomes, postoperative complications and the 
primary indication for surgery are shown in Supplementary Tables 4-8. The regional country participation is shown in 
Supplementary Figure 3, and the African regional outcomes are shown in Supplementary Table 9.  
 
Sensitivity analyses 
The outcomes reported according to hospital facility level are shown in Supplementary Table 10. The per-protocol 
sensitivity analysis of only the patients from the hospitals which provided complete hospital facility data are shown in 
Supplementary Table 11. The full case sensitivity analysis, with multiple imputation of missing data to test for potential 
bias associated with missing variables is shown in Supplementary Table 12. Both these sensitivity analyses provided 
similar results to the primary multivariable analysis. The sensitivity analyses which explored the effect of the hospital 
  
13 
facility level or university-affiliation on mortality are shown in Supplementary Tables 13 and 14. Hospitals of a higher 
facility level were independently associated with increased mortality, but university-affiliation was not. None of the 
sensitivity analyses have altered our overall findings.

Discussion 
Key findings 
The principal finding of this study was that surgical patients in Africa are younger, with a low risk profile and low 
complication rates, and yet are twice as likely to die when compared to the global average. Approximately one in five 
surgical patients in Africa develops a postoperative complication, and one in ten of these patients will die. It is likely 
that many of these deaths are preventable. This large prospective cohort of surgery in 247 hospitals in 25 African 
countries, has revealed the limited workforce resources to provide safe surgical treatment. While it is imperative to 
increase access to surgery for the people of Africa, it is essential that that these surgical treatments are safe and 
effective.27 Importantly, 95% of deaths occur in the postoperative period, suggesting that many lives could be saved by 
effective surveillance for physiological deterioration amongst patients who have developed complications and 
addressing the resources necessary to achieve this objective. Surgical outcomes will remain poor in Africa15 until this 
problem is addressed.  
 
Interpretation 
Our results indicate that postoperative mortality following surgery is significantly higher in Africa, when compared to 
other international cohorts, despite a lower patient risk profile and lower postoperative complication rates.9 Improving 
the quality of surgery is a function of structures, processes and outcomes as defined by the Lancet Commission on 
Global Surgery.4 Our results provide important data on some of the processes and outcomes which need to be addressed 
in Africa. The great majority of these deaths occur on the days following surgery, and it seems likely that many are 
preventable. There are few published reports of postoperative outcomes in Africa, but our interpretation is consistent 
with the findings of a number of smaller epidemiological studies exploring postoperative mortality in African countries, 
with described mortality rates which were similar to,14,28 or higher than those in the current study.29,30 In a recent global 
study of mortality following emergency abdominal surgery, the majority of deaths also occurred more than 24 hours 
surgery.14 Our observations are also consistent with reports of intraoperative and/or anaesthetic related mortality rates in 
low-income countries.15,31 The findings of the current and previous work may be partly explained by the limited 
workforce resources, and poor early warning systems to detect the physiological deterioration of the patients who have 
developed complications.32 The median number of 0·7 specialists (a combined total of surgeons, obstetricians and 
anaesthesiologists) per 100,000 population in this study, is well below the inflection point of 20 to 40 specialists per 
100,000 thought necessary to decrease perioperative mortality.4 Furthermore, there are fewer hospital, and critical care 
bed resources than recently reported at the global level.9 Consequently, mortality following perioperative complications 
is significantly greater in Africa. The problem of unrecognised postoperative physiological deterioration on the surgical 
ward has been well described.32 Interventions such as early warning scores, critical care outreach, medical emergency 
  
15 
teams, and critical care skills training for junior surgeons, are now standard in most high-income countries. ‘Failure to 
rescue’ and similar metrics have been successfully used to support data driven quality improvement projects.33 Our 
findings suggest that the drivers of perioperative death may be broadly consistent across Africa, although further 
prospective audit is required to understand the site-specific drivers in individual hospitals, and countries. Recent work 
has demonstrated the feasibility of surgical outcomes audit in low-income countries.28,34 A pragmatic continent-wide 
quality improvement programme may improve the allocation of resources towards the postoperative surveillance of 
patients most at risk. A simple surgical risk calculator may facilitate this approach.  
 
Strengths and limitations 
To our knowledge, this is the most comprehensive evaluation of surgical workforce density and patient outcomes 
following surgery conducted so far in Africa. Although, our study was not designed to inform detailed healthcare policy 
decisions in individual countries, the data are likely to have a significant impact throughout Africa. It seems likely that 
the drivers of morbidity and mortality are similar across these countries. Some of the country level data presented may 
provide the outcomes information required to power future country-specific studies of postoperative morbidity and 
mortality. Assuming a mortality rate of 2% and a 18% postoperative complication rate, an individual country-level 
surgical outcomes audit would require a 3000 patient sample to provide a reliable mortality estimate with a 95% 
confidence interval of 1%, and a 1400 patient sample to provide reliable complication rate with a 95% confidence 
interval of 4%. We used a simple data set consisting primarily of categorical variables to minimise the amount of 
missing data. Patient-level variables were selected on the basis that they were objective, routinely collected for clinical 
reasons, could be accurately transcribed with a low rate of missing data, and would be relevant to a risk adjustment 
model which included a variety of surgical procedures. National co-ordinators confirmed the face validity of their raw 
data prior to analysis.  
 
The study also has some weaknesses. The 7-day cohort design was chosen as a pragmatic approach to tackling the 
paucity of epidemiological data describing this population. However, care should be taken in applying our findings in 
individual hospitals and countries. Variation in factors such as seasonal weather, industrial action, available healthcare 
workforce, armed conflict, surgical workload, and the healthcare seeking behaviour of patients, may all influence our 
results. Furthermore, these factors may also affect direct comparisons of surgical outcomes with high income countries. 
Fourteen countries did not provide per-protocol data samples, which may compromise the generalizability to these 
countries. However, it is possible that those hospitals unable to meet our protocol requirements face even greater 
difficulties in ensuring good patient outcomes. Indeed, more than half the countries in our study could not fulfil the 
protocol requirements for an included sample, and in hindsight these rules were inappropriately strict. Whilst 25 African 
countries participated, this was fewer than half of the countries in Africa, and a number of low-income countries did not 
  
16 
take part. Generalization to those unrepresented countries must be cautious, although it is possible that they too may 
have particular difficulties in delivering good surgical outcomes. Nearly half of the hospitals included in this study were 
university affiliated, and it is possible that our findings may underestimate poor patient outcomes reflected in smaller, 
more remote hospitals. We defined complications according to published criteria, also used in the ISOS study.9 These 
definitions were developed in high-income countries, and it is possible that some complications were under-reported 
due to limited access to diagnostic tests, for example in the case of myocardial infarction. Meanwhile the assessment of 
some other complications can be subjective, in particular surgical site infection. Whilst few of our investigators were 
experienced researchers, it was beyond of the scope of this project to train them in a standard approach to assessing 
individual complications. This may have resulted in variability between hospitals. It is important to note that our 
primary focus was on all complications, rather than a specific individual complication. We carefully replicated the 
design of the previous ISOS study to allow comparison with the current global standard, but it should be noted that this 
comparison was not fully contemporaneous as these data were collected in 2014 whilst ASOS was conducted in 2016. 
 
Conclusions 
Surgical patients in Africa are younger, with a lower risk profile and low complication rates, but twice as likely to die 
when compared to the global average. Most deaths occur after surgery suggesting a need to improve the safety through 
postoperative surveillance for deteriorating patients on the ward. Contributory factors include limited numbers of 
specialists, poor hospital infrastructure, and low procedural volumes. The Lancet Commission on Global Surgery 
advocates improving access to safe, accessible and affordable surgical care. This study highlights the importance of 
effective perioperative care to achieving this objective in Africa. A pragmatic continent-wide quality improvement 
programme, including prospective audit, may reduce the number of preventable deaths following surgery in Africa.

*The country specific crude mortality rates and complication rates are particularly unstable as the study was not powered to accurately determine the country specific 
mortality and complication rates. A country sample size of at least 3000 patients would be required for a relatively stable estimate of mortality and 1400 patients for a 
relatively stable estimate of postoperative complications.
