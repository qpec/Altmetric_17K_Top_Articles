There exists an abundance of barriers that hinder functional recovery following spinal
cord injury, especially at chronic stages. Here, we examine the rescue of breathing up to
1.5 years following cervical hemisection in the rat. In spite of complete hemidiaphragm
paralysis, a single injection of chondroitinase ABC in the phrenic motor pool restored robust
and persistent diaphragm function while improving neuromuscular junction anatomy. This
treatment strategy was more effective when applied chronically than when assessed acutely
after injury. The addition of intermittent hypoxia conditioning further strengthened the
ventilatory response. However, in a sub-population of animals, this combination treatment
caused excess serotonergic (5HT) axon sprouting leading to aberrant tonic activity in the
diaphragm that could be mitigated via 5HT2 receptor blockade. Through unmasking of the
continuing neuroplasticity that develops after injury, our treatment strategy ensured rapid
and robust patterned respiratory recovery after a near lifetime of paralysis.

he ability to restore function following lengthy, paralyzing
spinal cord injury (SCI) is a daunting prospect. The
success of acutely applied treatments is rarely replicated
chronically1,2 in part due to axonal entrapment within the glial
scar, reduced levels of regeneration-associated genes and pro-
teins3, and maintenance of a plasticity dampening perineuronal
net (PNN)4. Modest anatomical regeneration of motor and sen-
sory axons is possible a year following injury5, particularly when
intrinsic neuronal growth is stimulated via Pten deletion6 or when
neurotrophic factors are combined with peripheral nerve graft-
ing7. However, restoration of essential motor systems at extended
time points after SCI has long proved elusive. This has led to
the long-standing belief that robust functional recovery chroni-
cally is far more difficult, if not impossible, to achieve.
Over 50% of human SCIs cause deficits in respiratory motor
and ventilatory function8,9. The inability to breathe is the major
cause of morbidity and mortality in human SCI patients9.
Marginal (~10% of pre-injury levels) restoration of respiratory
muscle activity following acute cervical hemisection has been
achieved utilizing chondroitinase ABC (ChABC)10. This enzyme
catabolizes the chondroitin sulphate proteoglycans (CSPGs) of
the protective, yet growth inhibitory, scar and PNNs, facilitating
axonal
regeneration
or
sprouting
and
enhancing
synaptic
strength11,12. These functional gains are partially caused by
increased sprouting of 5HT fibres13. Combining ChABC with
task-specific rehabilitation after SCI is known to increase loco-
motor ability by augmenting and structuring plasticity14,15.
Similar to locomotor training, acute repetitive intermittent
hypoxia (IH) conditioning can facilitate a small, transient gain in
respiratory function following sub-chronic SCI16. We speculated
whether a combined ChABC and IH treatment might achieve
a meaningful degree of long-lasting respiratory motor repair
at protracted stages after cervical hemisection. At extended
time points post-injury, our strategy produced rapid and robust
respiratory motor recovery which was largely dependent on
matrix degradation. The recovered activity was persistent over
time and greatly superior to that which occurred acutely.
Results
No spontaneous hemi-diaphragm recovery. Adult rats received
a lateral cervical (C) level C2 hemisection. This injury severs
ipsilateral glutamatergic and serotonergic projections from the
brainstem (Supplementary Figure 1a)17, abolishing the major
descending inputs to the phrenic motor pool (PMP). This
extensive injury damages areas of the spinal cord containing pre-
phrenic interneuron pathways and direct projections which ulti-
mately innervate the PMP (Supplementary Figure 1d-i). At its
epicentre, the slightly over-hemisected lesion encompassed 51.2%
of the total spinal cord volume (Supplementary Figure 1h).
Quantitative analysis of lesion volumetrics from a set region
around the injury showed minimal divergence in the lesion
area between animals (analysis of variance; ANOVA, p = 0.0781;
F(5,15) = 2.49). There was no evidence that regeneration occur-
red through the site of injury. 49.8% of animals demonstrated
minimal ipsilateral hemidiaphragm activity during nasal occlu-
sion at baseline (Supplementary Figure 1j-l). This form of ven-
tilatory stimulation strongly increases respiratory drive, but not
through pathways associated with eupneic breathing18,19 (Sup-
plementary Figure 1j-k). Importantly, having a minimal response
to transient nasal occlusion did not predict which animals would
recover following treatment (Supplementary Figure 1l). In our
hands, this anatomically and physiologically complete injury
results in total and persistent, ipsilateral hemidiaphragm paralysis
during eupnea at all chronic time points (Figs. 1d–g, 2b–g, 3b–e
and 6b, c, e, f; see below).
ECM breakdown restores respiratory function. Treatment was
started 12 weeks after the hemisection (Supplementary Table 1,
group 1). Following baseline diaphragm electromyography (dia-
EMG) recordings, animals received a single injection of either
ChABC or vehicle into the ipsilateral C4 PMP (Fig. 1a). As such,
we were not trying to aid regeneration through the site of injury
but, rather, facilitate sprouting from the contralateral side in
order to augment the recovery of function at the cervical level
where it is likely to be required. Conditioning with IH or air
(normoxia; Nx) was delayed for 7 days. Mimicking an established
daily protocol16 (Fig. 1a), conditioning/air breathing occurred for
3 weeks before final diaEMG recordings.
Treatment of the chronic injury with vehicle and air/IH caused
no functional restoration of the ipsilateral hemidiaphragm
or compensatory increases in contralateral diaEMG amplitude
(Fig. 1b–e; Supplementary Movies 1 and 2). Plasticity induced by
IH conditioning has previously been shown to aid locomotor
function (see below)16,20. However, we demonstrate that, by itself,
it did not manifest significant effects upon eupnoeic pulmonary
activity in long-term, completely hemiplegic subjects. IH con-
ditioning caused significant increases in glial fibrillary acidic
protein (GFAP) immunoreactivity within the ipsilateral (ANOVA,
p = 0.0003, F = 13.73) and contralateral (ANOVA, p = 0.0065,
F = 6.74) PMPs (Supplementary Figure 2b-f and aa-ae), confirm-
ing that conditioning can stimulate astrocytic reactivity21. Wisteria
floribunda agglutinin (WFA) staining revealed that the IH-
induced increase in GFAP did not correlate with an augmentation
in PNNs (Fig. 1w–aa; Supplementary Figure 2v-z).
Application of ChABC (with or without IH) resulted in the
restoration of synchronized diaphragm function ipsilateral to the
injury in 66.7% of the animals (Fig. 1b, f, g; ANOVA, p < 0.0001,
F = 38.79). The restored activity was far greater than that
achieved via the same treatment applied acutely post SCI10 and
was not statistically different from that of the contralateral
hemidiaphragm (Supplementary Movie 3). These data show that
CSPG removal is both necessary and sufficient to restore
respiratory motor function at chronic stages after SCI. This
result has been replicated three times during various experiments
(Supplementary Table 1), demonstrating the accuracy and
validity of the data in a large number of animals. Following
ChABC treatment in our first cohort, the contralateral hemi-
diaphragm functioned at ~60% of that generated during airway
occlusion (Fig. 1c). This percentage corresponds to values typical
of an uninjured and anaesthetised animal22. As our injured
animals are unlikely to be hypercapnic or hypoxic23, these data
suggest that chronic motor system behavioural compensation
acts to ensure respiratory activity responds at physiologic levels
during eupnea, potentially through an increase in respiration
rate23. Following ChABC-mediated ECM breakdown with air,
the ipsilateral hemidiaphragm functioned at ~30% of that during
airway occlusion (Fig. 1b). When ChABC was combined with IH,
diaphragm activity increased to ~40%. As such, IH conditioning
conferred modest benefit to the ChABC-mediated treatment
strategy, possibly due to increased neuroplasticity16. Indeed,
the combination treatment promoted coordinated motor activity
indistinguishable
from
normal
respiration
(Supplementary
Movie 4). Importantly, restoration of function occurred rapidly
following the induction of treatment. Two of the combination
treated animals showed unique tonic firing of the ipsilateral
hemidiaphragm (star data points, Fig. 1b; see Fig. 4 and further
discussion below). The frequency of breaths was not statistically
different between treatment conditions (Supplementary Figure 2a;
ANOVA, p = 0.1422, F = 1.821) indicating that respiratory
control mechanisms emanating from the lower brainstem remain
intact following the induction of plasticity in the chronically
injured animal24.

 33.3% of the animals in both the ChABC treatment groups did
not respond to the enzyme (triangle data points, Fig. 1b). Enzyme
activity was confirmed through WFA (ANOVA, ipsilateral p =
0.013,
F = 5.54;
contralateral
p = 0.0049,
F = 7.27)
and
2B6 staining (ANOVA, ipsilateral p = 0.015, F = 5.33; contral-
ateral p = 0.018, F = 4.97) at the level of the PMPs (Fig. 1r–aa;
Supplementary Figure 2q-z) demonstrating chondroitin sulphate
removal from both the ECM and PNN. Further, immunohis-
tochemistry showed that TrkB increased in response to IH
treatment (Fig. 1m–q; Supplementary Figure 2l-p) in the
ipsilateral (ANOVA, p = 0.0411, F = 3.76) and contralateral
(ANOVA, p = 0.0015; F = 9.78) PMPs. These data confirm that
IH conditioning had manifested its well-known effects upon
receptor expression at the PMP25. 5HT also increased following
IH treatment on the ipsilateral side of the cord (Fig. 1h–l;
ANOVA, p = 0.0411, F = 3.76). However, these 5-HT and
receptor increases did not result in functional recovery. None-
theless, the amount of 5HT was positively correlated with the
activity amplitude of the ipsilateral hemidiaphragm (Supplemen-
tary Table 2; coefficient of determination, R2 = 0.228, p = 0.045),
suggesting that enzyme treatment in non-responding animals did
not induce enough 5HT sprouting to facilitate positive gains in
function. In support of this hypothesis we found that removal of
CSPGs
was
strongly
correlated
with
increasing
ipsilateral
hemidiaphragm amplitude (Supplementary Table 2; coefficient
of determination, R2 = 0.698, p = 0.00005) and that there was a
positive correlation between 5HT staining intensity and that of
both 2B6 (coefficient of determination, R2 = 0.524, p = 0.002)
and WFA (coefficient of determination, R2 = 0.302, p = 0.027) at
the ipsilateral PMP (Supplementary Table 2). Interestingly,
upregulation of TrkB also showed a positive correlation with
increased
amplitude
on
the
ipsilateral
side
of
the
cord
(Supplementary Table 2; coefficient of determination, R2 =
0.477, p = 0.003). However, TrkB staining intensity did not
correlate well with CSPG removal (2B6: coefficient of determina-
tion, R2 = 0.125, p = 0.178; WFA: R2 = 0.077, p = 0.298), sug-
gesting that increases in this receptor may have been facilitated
by IH-induced plasticity. As only animals with CSPG removal
show recovery of function, increases in 5HT may be deemed
more significant to recovery than TrkB. No other correlations
on either the ipsi- or contralateral side of the cord yielded a
significant result (Supplementary Table 2). These data suggest
that robust restoration of respiratory function following chronic
SCI could be dependent, but only in part, upon levels of
endogenous serotonin (Fig. 1h–l).
Persistent breathing restoration by CSPG breakdown. To
examine the magnitude of the restorative effect that ECM
degradation and optimal respiratory conditioning had upon
respiratory motor behaviour, 12 weeks after C2 hemisection,
additional groups of animals were all injected with ChABC
(Fig. 2a; Supplementary Table 1, group 2). The activity of the
enzyme at the PMP was confirmed through 2B6 and WFA
staining (Supplementary Figure 3b-c,f-g,h-i). IH conditioning or
air were then administered for 1, 3, or 5 weeks.
The degree of functional restoration achieved in all groups was
significant (ANOVA, p < 0.0001; F = 14.43). Again, 66.7% of the
animals in each group demonstrated strong, synchronized activity
in the ipsilateral hemidiaphragm (Fig. 2b–h). Recovery was
maximal in as little as 2 weeks following administration of the
enzyme and as brief as 1 week exposure to IH (Fig. 2b, c). The
amplitude of activity in all groups was statistically similar to that
exhibited in the contralateral hemidiaphragm (Fig. 2h, i). Animals
treated with ChABC and air achieved ipsilateral diaphragm activity
which functioned at ~30% of that recruited during occlusion. This
activity occurred at ~57% in all animals treated with ChABC and
IH, analogous to the uninjured animal (Fig. 2h, i)22.
The rapid functional improvement at all time points likely
reflects sprouting or, more likely, the sustained unmasking of
ongoing neuroplasticity engendered around the ipsilateral PMP
and, particularly, 5HT-positive fibres (Fig. 2j–p; ANOVA, p =
0.404, F = 1.08). Indeed, 66.66% of animals treated with either
ChABC or ChABC+IH for 6 weeks (groups 2e+f and 4c+d)
which had not responded to treatment demonstrated activity
within the previously paralysed hemidiaphragm upon bolus
application of 5HT (Fig. 2q–s). These data highlight that
removing the inhibitory matrix around the PMP, resulting in
increased levels of 5HT, is necessary and sufficient to enable
restoration of respiratory motor function following chronic
injury. Increases in TrkB receptors were also sustained (Supple-
mentary Figure 3a,e; ANOVA; ipsilateral: p = 0.235, F = 1.51;
contralateral: p = 0.313, F = 1.28) aiding recovery at all acute
time points following treatment. During this time, the PNN was
gradually
returning
within
the
ipsilateral
phrenic
nucleus
(Supplementary Figure 3c) signifying how these treatment-
induced anatomical alterations were slowly being incorporated
into the spinal cord environment. The frequency of breaths was,
again, not statistically different between treatment conditions
(Supplementary Figure 3j; ANOVA, p = 0.2247, F = 1.406).
To assess the effect our treatment strategy had upon the
respiratory motor system as a whole, we assessed diaphragm
neuromuscular junctions (diaNMJs) (Supplementary Figure 4a-i).
Animals treated with ChABC and 5 weeks of IH conditioning or
air, showed higher numbers of intact diaNMJs across the
ipsilateral hemidiaphragm (ANOVA, ventral p = 0.0093, F =
7.16; medial p = 0.0356, F = 4.44; dorsal p = 0.0121, F = 6.56;
Supplementary Table 1, group 4). This correlated with clear
decreases in complete (ANOVA, ventral p = 0.0049, F = 8.74)
and partially (ANOVA, ventral p = 0.0117, F = 6.64; medial p =
0.0106, F = 6.86; dorsal p = 0.0106, F = 6.86) denervated junc-
tions in these groups. We also assessed the effect that ECM
degradation had upon the functional capacity of the diaphragm at
this time point in the same animals. Plethysmography data
revealed that IH (in either saline and ChABC injected animals)
did not significantly enhance ventilatory responses (VE) at early
(6 week) time points post-treatment. We did, however, observe
improvements following ChABC treatment in both the hypoxic
and hypercapnic ventilatory responses (HVR and HCVR) and in
both cases the effects were primarily through alterations in
frequency (Supplementary Figure 5a–c). Especially notable,
however, was the more robust ventilatory capacity (specifically
the HVR, Supplementary Figure 5b) in the longer-term animals
(3–6 months post-treatment; Supplementary Table 1, group 3, see
below) which was mediated through changes in frequency and
tidal volume (VT). At these lengthy time points, treatment with
ChABC alone, or in combination with IH, revealed beneficial
characteristics (Supplementary Figure 5d–f). These data are
important as they were conducted in freely moving unanaesthe-
tised animals. As all responses to baseline conditions (air) were
statistically
non-divergent
between
groups
(Supplementary
Table 3), these data suggest that ChABC treatment can facilitate
an extended and beneficial return of function in injured animals.
We had established that CSPG breakdown and conditioning
mediates restoration of respiratory function following chronic
diaphragm paralysis. However, the potential permanence of this
effect needed to be examined. Twelve weeks after C2 hemisection,
two new groups of animals were injected with ChABC (Fig. 3a)
and received 1 week of either IH conditioning or air. Following
the end of treatment, the animals were housed for a further 3 or
6 months before end point recordings were conducted (Supple-
mentary Table 1, group 3).

 Three months after treatment end, 2/3 of the animals in each

activity, identical to that present immediately after treatment end
(ANOVA, p < 0.0001, F = 14.4; Fig. 3b, c, f). The amplitude of
this response was statistically similar to that of the contralateral

 6 months after the end of treatment showed restoration in the
ipsilateral hemidiaphragm (Fig. 3g). This would suggest that the
treatment triggered recovery processes continued long after its
conclusion, and that some animals just take longer to show the
effects produced by ECM removal.
The robustness of ChABC-mediated ECM breakdown to
engender recovery throughout the respiratory motor system was
seen again through diaNMJ analyses (Supplementary Figure 4j-
m). The amount of intact, denervated and reinnervated diaNMJs
at 6 months post-treatment was the same as that produced
immediately after treatment end (Supplementary Figure 4e-m)
with no statistical differences between the air and IH groups
(ANOVA). Interestingly, the ventilatory response showed a
substantial increase at 3 and 6 months after treatment end
(Supplementary Figure 5d-f). This effect was mediated by both
tidal volume and frequency. The reason for this increase in
response in both treatment groups between 14 and 98 days post-
treatment should be further explored, however, it was persistent
lasting up to 183 days post-treatment (ANOVA, HVR p < 0.0001
for all measures; HCVR p < 0.05 for all measures).
The long-lasting effect caused by ChABC treatment may be
due to the reformation of the PNNs at the level of the ipsilateral
and contralateral PMPs (Fig. 3l–n; Supplementary Figure 6e-g;
ANOVA, ipsilateral p = 0.3505, F = 28.67; contralateral p =
0.1678, F = 7.8), that serve to stabilize the functional changes
within the spinal cord. The lack of ChABC activity at this time
could be seen through the substantial reduction in stub antigen
(2B6) staining (Fig. 3j, k, n; Supplementary Figure 6c-d,g;
ANOVA, ipsilateral p = 0.7483, F = 3.494; contralateral p =
0.3979, F = 4.188). However, levels of 5HT positive fibres within
the ipsilateral (Fig. 3h, i, n) and contralateral (Supplementary

Return of function in multiple motor systems. While able to
ambulate, feed, drink, etc., C2 hemisected animals exhibit deficits
in forelimb behaviour. This includes reduced gross and fine
movements of the ipsilateral limb (Supplementary Figure 7b-g).
Despite our treatment application not being optimised for effects
upon the forelimb (specifically in the spinal placement of ChABC
at C4), the strategy none-the-less elicited improvements in upper
arm function, likely mediated via enzyme diffusion caudally.
Indeed, we show enzyme activity both ipsilateral and contralateral
to the original injury at C6 of the spinal cord in close proximity to
the rubrospinal tract (Supplementary Figure 7h-j; ANOVA, group
4 = ipsi: p < 0.001, F(3,11) = 13.94; contra: p = 0.0146, F(3,11) =
6.64; group 3 = ipsi: p = 0.6951; contra: p = 0.755). In animals
injured for 3 months prior to treatment with ChABC and either
5 weeks of IH conditioning or air (Supplementary Figure 7a), the
forelimb asymmetry test showed significant differences between
treatment groups (ANOVA, p < 0.0001, F(2,24) = 11.29; Supple-
mentary Table 1, groups 3a+b, 4) over time (ANOVA, p < 0.0001,
F(6,144) = 28.46). Animals receiving the enzyme more readily
used both limbs to move about and explore their environment
(~70% compared to ~30% in control animals; Supplementary
Figure 7b-d). This effect was sustained up to 3 months following
the end of treatment (ANOVA, drug: p = 0.1942, F(1,12) = 1.89;
time: p < 0.0001, F(14,168) = 6.27). Noteworthy was the trending
effect that IH alone had upon forelimb function (Supplementary
Figure 7). While not significantly different from controls, this
conditioning treatment was sufficient to marginally increase the
use of both forelimbs to ~50%. These data support the work in
rodent and human subjects showing that IH can improve loco-
motor
behaviour16,20.
Importantly,
the
ChABC+IH-treated
animals also showed significant differences from controls in
ipsilateral forelimb behaviour during the grooming test (Supple-
mentary Figure 7e-g). Treatment affected forelimb function
(ANOVA, p < 0.0001, F(3,24) = 11.87) over time (ANOVA, p <
0.0001, F(6,144) = 6.36) with the ChABC+IH-treated animals
showing a greater functional range. This improvement was sus-
tained up to 3 months following the end of treatment (ANOVA,
drug: p = 0.8366, F(1,12) = 0.04; time p < 0.0001, F(14,168) =
4.93). Restoration of gross upper forelimb behaviour would
suggest possible sprouting of the rubrospinal tract7 and that our
treatment strategy is able to functionally modulate multiple
motor systems simultaneously.
Plasticity can cause tonic hemi-diaphragm firing. The com-
bined ChABC+IH-induced restoration of respiratory function
did not always yield a normally patterned respiratory diaEMG
response (Fig. 4a, b). 33.3% (or 50% of those with hemidiaphragm
recovery) of the animals that had received ChABC at 3 months
post-SCI and either 3 or 5 weeks (but not 1 week) of IH con-
ditioning (star data points, Figs. 1b, 2h, Supplementary Table 1,
groups 1d, 2c+f, 3b, 4d) presented tonic firing patterns only in
the ipsilateral hemidiaphragm (Figs. 4a, b, 5; Supplementary
Movie 5). This occurred either continuously or as waves of firing
(Supplementary Figure 8a-b). While the severity of this activity
varied (Fig. 5), cycle-triggered averaging (CTA) showed it to be
somewhat structured. Motor units increased firing in synchrony
with the contralateral hemidiaphragm to initiate inspiration and
expiration (Figs. 4c–f, 5). Importantly, this unique activity
diminished by the 5th week of IH treatment (Figs. 4a–f, 5),
correlating with PNN reappearance (Supplementary Figure 3c).
Indeed, 3 months after the end of treatment some aberrant single
motor unit firing was evident in two ChABC+IH-treated animals
(Supplementary Figure 6h). Tonic activity was not present in any
animals 6 months after the end of treatment (Supplementary
Figure 6i).
Tonic activity: 5HT and receptor imbalances. The mechanism
underlying tonic respiratory motoneuron activity had to be
revealed to understand its effect upon ventilation. We divided our
immunohistochemical analysis of the ChABC+IH treatment
groups into non-responders, normally patterned responders and
those that showed tonic motoneuron firing (Fig. 4g). With
3 weeks of IH, animals that displayed tonic diaphragm activity
demonstrated especially high levels of 5HT (Fig. 4g, i, k; Sup-
plementary Table 1, groups 1d, 2c). At 5 weeks of IH treatment,
the amount of 5HT in the ipsilateral PMP had diminished, cor-
relating with the reduction of tonic motor unit firing in the
diaphragm (Fig. 4b, g, i, k; Supplementary Table 1, groups 2f, 4d).
These trends were mirrored in the contralateral PMPs (Supple-
mentary Figure 9o).
When divided by treatment response, the constitutively active
serotonergic receptors 5HT2c/a increased within the ipsilateral
motor pool in animals that responded to ChABC+IH (Fig. 4h;
Supplementary Figure 9a-n). This occurred more modestly in the
contralateral PMP and in response to ChABC treatment alone
(Supplementary Figure 9o-q). These receptors are upregulated
following SCI to augment the excitability of spinal motor neurons
without being dependent upon 5HT itself26. As such, they may
play a partial role in causing the restoration of function. However,
animals that displayed tonic motor unit firing ipsilateral to the
injury did not have unusually high numbers of 5HT2c/a receptors
(Fig. 4k, l).
What might be the effect of further increasing serotonergic
activity in animals that responded normally to the combination
treatment or blocking 5HT function in those where respiration

 was tonic? We applied 5HT to a subset of ChABC+IH-treated
animals that displayed recovery of synchronized ipsilateral
hemidiaphragm activity (Fig. 4m; n = 7; 5 systemic applications,
2 direct injections). Following application, in all animals the
ipsilateral hemidiaphragm rapidly developed tonic motor unit
firing that did not dissipate until the neuromodulator had likely
been metabolized. Further, in all animals that exhibited tonic
ipsilateral activity (n = 6; 4 systemic applications, 2 direct
injections), application of a 5HT2c/a antagonist blocked the

 synchronized to the contralateral hemidiaphragm (Fig. 4n).
Subsequent application of 5HT caused the reappearance of tonic
ipsilateral motor unit firing, with the same abnormal patterning
as seen initially (Fig. 4n). CTA analysis revealed patterning within
this abnormal activity. Collectively these data show that, in the
presence of excessive amounts of 5HT, even a moderate density of
the constitutively active 5HT2c/a receptors, can cause tonic
excitability of the ipsilateral phrenic motor neurons.
Breathing restoration 1.5 years after paralysis. To fully elucidate
the potential for our combination therapy to stimulate respiratory
motor recovery at protracted time periods following spinal
trauma, we treated animals with either vehicle or ChABC that
had been paralysed by a complete C2 hemisection 1.5 years earlier
(see Supplementary Table 1, group 5 for discussion of group
allocation).
Following 1.5 years of complete hemidiaphragm paralysis
(Fig. 6b, c), some activity returned to the ipsilateral hemidiaph-
ragm just 7 days after ECM breakdown by ChABC in 40% of the
animals (Fig. 6c, d). Application of the vehicle did not cause
functional diaphragm recovery and there was no evidence of a
compensatory increase in the contralateral diaEMG (Fig. 6b, d;
Supplementary Figure 10a). Enzyme activity was confirmed
through WFA and 2B6 staining (Supplementary Figure 10h-o,y-
af). This rapid restoration in activity was surprising considering
the diaphragm starts to atrophy within 24 h following C2
hemisection27, and may explain why the amplitude of activity
was initially small. One week later, 60% of the animals responded
to ChABC treatment demonstrating strong synchronized dia-
EMG activity (Fig. 6e–g). With an additional 2 weeks, 100% of
the animals had responded to the treatment (ANOVA, p = 0.012,
F = 2.706). Animals treated with ChABC and either air or IH
breathed during eupnea at ~45% of their maximal capacity, values

 not statistically different from the contralateral hemidiaphragm
(Fig. 6h). A meagre amount of tonic activity was demonstrated in
one ChABC+IH-treated animal following 1 week of conditioning
(Supplementary Figure 8c). Interestingly, this abnormal response
vanished with 2 weeks further treatment, confirming that tonic
activity is removed over time.
This noteworthy restoration of respiratory function 1.5 years
following SCI correlates with an increase in 5HT at the PMP
ipsilateral to the injury (Fig. 6i–l). Similarly, it is associated with
increases in the 5HT2c/a and TrkB receptors in both the
ipsilateral and contralateral PMPs (Supplementary Figure 10d-k,
t-ab). Further, the frequency of breaths was not statistically
different
between
all
treatment
conditions
(Supplementary
Figure 10b-c; ANOVA, p = 5.611, F = 0.8357).
Discussion
We show that chondroitinase digestion of CSPGs within the ECM
following a single, minimally invasive local dose in the vicinity of
the PMP can recover respiratory motor function up to a near
lifetime of diaphragm paralysis. This is the first illustration that
persistent, complete functional restoration in any motor system is
possible well over a year following SCI. Further, the rapid
restoration of function is superior to anything achieved at acute
or sub-chronic stages after injury using similar techniques, sug-
gesting that this plasticity inducing or revealing treatment may be
best applied not within days or weeks (as is typically done) but
many months after injury to maximise its effect. Moreover, we
show that the recovered behaviour is maintained up to 6 months
after the end of treatment in numerous effectors within the
respiratory motor system including ventilatory function, muscle
activity and the physiological state of muscle–nerve junctions.
Our data adds to and refines the current thinking concerning
the two treatment strategies we have used in combination. Firstly,
we show that in the absence of spontaneous recovery, IH does
little to recover respiratory motor function at long chronic time
points. This suggests that for IH to be an effective form of
rehabilitation, a motor system needs to be reasonably active
rather than completely paralysed. Thus, IH may be able to aug-
ment existing function, rather than recover it20. Further, it has
previously been shown that ChABC treatment can open a win-
dow of opportunity for the addition of task-specific training to
have a meaningful functional benefit on the locomotor system14.
However, our data suggest that ChABC alone, especially at long
protracted times after SCI, is both necessary and sufficient to
recover substantial function at all levels of the respiratory motor
system. The question remains as to why the long paralysed and
atrophied hemidiaphragm can recover so quickly and fully
without extensive respiratory rehabilitation? It is likely that, while
the ipsilateral motor pathways are not directly activated, the
constant passive stretching of the paralysed hemidiaphragm (see
Supplementary Movies 1 and 2) may act as a form of rehabili-
tation aiding protein synthesis as well as the upregulation of
neurotrophic factors thereby minimising the loss of muscle mass
and NMJs over time28,29. As such, the muscles may be primed for
recovery, requiring only the reformation of sufficient connections
within the motor circuitry.
What is the anatomical substrate that mediates such robust
recovery? As regeneration through the site of injury did not
occur, it is possible that it involves the activation of latent path-
ways17 or treatment-induced plasticity. Motor circuits deprived of
supraspinal input undergo substantial remodelling continuing
long after insult30,31. In our complete hemisection model,

 respiratory groups (with axons that cross the midline below the
level of injury or intervening interneurons with similar decus-
sating properties17,33) may be slowly forming new, potentially
active synapses over time that could be beneficial, harmless or
perhaps even detrimental. It is possible that this involves
recruitment of midline crossing V2a interneurons, which have
been shown to be critical for respiratory function and recovery
following high cervical SCI in both mice34,35 and rats36. Indeed,
using an ex vivo prep we have recently shown that latent gluta-
matergic spinal interneuronal networks in adult mice and rats
can, indeed, be harnessed to restore diaphragm function even
after debilitating injury37. Moreover, IH has recently been
implicated in the augmentation of propriospinal networks due
to its ability to increase the coupling of mid-cervical interneurons
with phrenic motoneurons38. We are currently using rat and
transgenic mouse models to address the precise mechanism
through which the recovery we describe has occurred and
the extent to which mid-cervical interneurons are involved38.
However, importantly, we demonstrate here that the potential
activity mediated via these newly generated connections is
completely curtailed by CSPGs in the PNN or surrounding
ECM. This demonstrates a novel way in which CSPGs do not just
limit growth and plasticity, but are involved in masking, stabi-
lizing and controlling activity within a system. The mechanism
by which CSPGs inhibit transmission still needs to be eluci-
dated39 but it is conceivable that they do so by clinging to
astrocyte processes that have been shown to wedge themselves
between synapses on phrenic motor neurons40. We demonstrate
that ChABC acts to digest this matrix and, in conjunction
with a renewed supply of 5-HT, likely rapidly unmasks the
functional potential of the sprouting that had already occurred.
However, we do not rule out the possibility that matrix digestion
might stimulate further neuronal sprouting11 to enhance the
activity of these plastic fibres41. The persistence of functional
recovery over 6 months after the end of treatment and reduction
in tonic motor neuron firing is likely due to the re-occurrence
of the PNN at the level of the PMP and the subsequent incor-
poration of the anatomical changes engendered through our
treatment strategy into the circuitry of the spinal cord.
An
additional
novelty
of
the
long-delayed
recovery
of
respiratory function is the generation of tonic hemidiaphragm
activity. This form of unusual muscle stimulation may be bene-
ficial to muscle strengthening, but detrimental to respiratory
function. It appears analogous to debilitating muscle spasms that
develop in other systems following SCI that have been shown to
be
partially
dependent
on
spontaneously
active
5-HT2C
receptors26,42,43. We have determined that a major part of the
mechanism behind this unique activity involves the raphe-spinal
system. Excesses in the amount of 5HT, brought about only
by the IH/enzyme combination, could result in large depolar-
isations and enhanced membrane resistance in the phrenic
motoneurons
acting,
in
turn,
to
increase
end-expiratory
lung
volume
facilitating
ventilation44,45.
Alternatively,
the
ipsilateral spasm-like activity may be detrimental to ventilation
by compromising lung function. The potential for untoward
activity could explain why the CNS acts to suppress potentially
aberrant motor system regeneration and plasticity following
trauma through proteoglycan upregulation within the ECM
and PNN. The reduction in tonic diaphragm activity over time
during and after the end of treatment could similarly be con-
sidered
comparable
to
the
connections
that
form
during
the development of motor circuits that are refined with
activity46,47. Indeed, increased 5HT is known to play a role in the
development, stabilization and maturation of the respiratory
control system42,48 and our treatment strategy may be recapitu-
lating this process.
Our data illustrate the relative ease with which an essential
motor system can regain functionality months to years after
severe hemiparalysis. The mechanism of this repair induced in
our model may have developmental and locomotor correlates
following chronic spinal trauma in other systems with re-crossed
projections such as the corticospinal, rubrospinal or propriospinal
tracts11,12,16. Indeed, we demonstrate that our simple treatment
strategy has simultaneous functional effects upon forelimb motor
function. These data suggest that the fundamental principles
driving persistent restoration of function after chronic trauma is
not limited to the respiratory motor system and may operate
through parallel mechanisms.
Methods
Ethical declaration and animal husbandry. All experiments were approved by the
Institutional Care and Use Committee at Case Western Reserve University, Cle-
veland. Animals were housed in groups of three, exposed to a normal dark–light
cycle with free access to food, water and environmental enrichment ad libitum. The
health and welfare of the animals was monitored by the study investigators and
veterinary staff at Case Western Reserve University.
Statistical assessment. For statistical analysis, divergences were considered sig-
nificant if p < 0.05. Data are presented as mean ± SEM. Power analysis was con-
ducted prior to all experiments to ensure n numbers were sufficient to yield reliable
data and were within the 88–96 percentiles. In instances where power was not
sufficient (due to experimental groups being sub-divided based on experimental
outcome), analysis was not conducted. However, in this instance, the statistical
analysis of total group outcomes was reported. At the time of recording, processing
and analysis of all experiments and assessments, investigators were blind as to the
treatment group of each animal. Data were subjected to the Shapiro–Wilk test for
normalcy prior to analysis to ensure a normal distribution. The functional and
behavioural recordings from every animal in each group were analysed without
exclusion based on the outcome. Division of animals into specific groups for the
experiments described has been outlined in Supplementary Table 1.
Surgical procedures: injury and spinal injections. Adult female Sprague Dawley
rats (200–250 g; Harlan Laboratories Inc., Indianapolis, IN, USA) were anaes-
thetized with a ketamine/xylazine cocktail (70 mg kg−1/7 mg kg−1) through
intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection. Once the surgical plane of anaesthetic depth had
been reached the animals were prepared for surgery by shaving and cleansing the
dorsal neck with Betadine and 70% ethyl alcohol and analgesics were administered
through subcutaneous (s.c.) injection of Carprofen (5 mg kg−1) and i.m. injections
of 0.002% bupivacaine hydrochloride along the site of incision. Body temperature
was maintained throughout the surgery at 37 ± 1 °C. A dorsal midline incision ~3
cm in length was made over the cervical region and the skin and paravertebral
muscles were retracted. A laminectomy was performed over C2 and C3 exposing
the rostral spinal cord. Using a 21G needle (with the tip positioned towards the
mid-line), a left lateral durotomy and hemisection were performed caudal to the C2
dorsal roots. The incision was made to the ventral lamina surface. This process was
repeated five times and extended from the midline to the most lateral extent of the
spinal cord. The anatomical completeness of the injury was confirmed through
microscopy (Supplementary Figure 1c). The muscle layers were sutured together
(3-0 vicryl) and the skin closed using wound clips. The animals were given
Buprenorphine (30 μg kg−1) and saline subcutaneously. This method of analgesia
and hydration was maintained up to 5 days post-surgery along with nutritional
support should the animals weight have dropped more than 5% of that pre-injury.
One week post-injury, the animals (housed in triplicate) were fully motile and
able to move, eat, drink, etc., with autonomy. Of the total number of animals used
in this study (see Supplementary Table 1), 1 stopped breathing immediately
following the injury and could not be recovered with manual ventilation. Of the
remaining rats, no animal kept for 3 months post-injury before treatment
application died due to complications relating to the initial spinal injury or the
experimental protocol. Of the animals kept for 1.5 years following injury, 3 of the
animals were sacrificed ~1-year post-injury due to complications of aging unrelated
to the initial trauma (natural death and the development of mammary tumours).
Approximately 5–8 weeks following injury, 10 animals showed increased biting of
their right hind limb. This was typically resolved through supplying all animals
with additional environmental enrichment. Four animals had the tips of their right
hind limbs removed following veterinary advice which prevented further
complications.
A number of laboratories have demonstrated varying degrees of spontaneous
hemidiaphragm recovery following this type of injury49,50. The cause of this
improvement may be due to the activation of decussating latent or recruited
projections, surviving ventral medial tissue at the point of injury, the imprecise
segmental location of the trauma, the effect of specific anaesthetics on respiratory
output at the time of recording, or sex and strain differences17,51,52. Our model
results in complete and persistent ipsilateral hemidiaphragm paralysis.

 Subsequently, our model reproduces the effects of severe human cervical SCI,
resulting in permanent hemidiaphragm paralysis53 and provides a solid baseline
from which to examine respiratory recovery. Furthermore, the majority of human
SCIs demonstrate sparing in a variable portion of descending axons. The complete
hemisection represents such a partial lesion with the benefit of generating
reproducible sparing from the contralateral side which, in turn, may potentially be
recruited to reactivate denervated phrenic motor neurons.
Since the recovery we have obtained is likely dependent upon the sprouting of a
reproducibly spared population of contralateral axons, one wonders whether this
strategy may be translated to more severe and variable human contusive injuries
that affect the cord bilaterally. Depending upon the amount of anatomical sparing
following such injuries, a degree of spontaneous diaphragm recovery can occur54.
Thus, in patients with some remaining descending supraspinal projections to the
cord, perhaps minimally sufficient to allow them to be partially respirator
independent, it is conceivable that this approach could also be successful. However,
following more complete cervical injuries, use of the enzyme alone is unlikely to
have significant benefit, without the construction of a regeneration promoting
bridge10.
Similar to acute injury studies10, the chronically injured animals received an
injection of either ChABC (Seikagaku; 20 U mL−1) or a saline vehicle control.
Investigators were blind as to which drug each animal received. Animals were
anaesthetized via i.p. injection with the ketamine/xylazine cocktail. Once the
animals had reached a surgical plane of anaesthesia, the dorsal neck was shaved
and cleansed with Betadine and 70% ethyl alcohol. Carprofen was administered s.c.
and bupivacaine hydrochloride i.m. along the site of incision. Body temperature
was maintained through the procedure at 37 ± 1 °C. A dorsal midline incision
opened the skin and paravertebral muscles again and they were retracted. A
laminectomy was performed over C4 and C5 and the dura cut. A pulled pipette
attached to a Nanoject II (Drummond Scientific Company) was stereotaxically
placed at the level of the phrenic nucleus (1.1 mm left of midline and 1.6 mm
ventral from the spinal cord dorsal surface). After placement and a 5-min rest
period, 250 nL of drug or vehicle was injected into the spinal cord. Once the pipette
was removed, the muscle layers were sutured together and the skin closed with
wound clips. Buprenorphine and saline were given s.c. with the analgesics
maintained for up to 5 days.
Intermittent hypoxia conditioning. Acute intermittent hypoxia (AIH) started
1 week following ChABC/saline injection. For 5 days each week animals were
placed in a chamber with access to food and water ab librium. The chamber was
flushed with air and O2 to attain continuous air (normoxia) or IH (5 min episodes
alternating between 10 and 21% O2; representative trace Supplementary Figure 1b).
After 10 hypoxic episodes, or the equivalent air (normoxic) duration of 100 min,
animals were returned to their cages16.
DiaEMG recordings and analysis. DiaEMG occurred 1 day following the con-
clusion of IH conditioning. Animals were anaesthetised with a ketamine/xylazine
cocktail. Once the animals had reached a surgical plane of anaesthesia, the
abdominal region was shaved and cleansed with Betadine and 70% ethyl alcohol.
Carprofen was administered s.c. and bupivacaine hydrochloride i.m. along the site
of incision. Body temperature was maintained through the surgical procedure at 37
± 1 °C. A 5 cm laparotomy was performed to expose the abdominal surface of the
diaphragm. Bipolar platinum electrodes (Grass Technology, Middleton, WI, USA)
were placed in the crural region of the left and right hemidiaphragms, dorsal to the
anterolateral branch of the inferior phrenic artery. Electrodes were not perma-
nently implanted into the diaphragm due to the inevitable formation of scar tissue
at the point of muscle insertion which, over time, diminished the signal output. As
such, the same animals had repeated abdominal surgeries to achieve the multiple
recordings produced in this study. Activity was amplified (gain 5000×), bandpass
filtered (30–3000 Hz; Grass Technology), digitized and recorded using a data
acquisition system (CED1401; Spike2; Cambridge Electronic Design). The inte-
grated signal was rectified and smoothed at a time constant of 0.075 s. All
recordings were obtained during eupnea prior to a 20-s nasal occlusion (length of
occlusion determined due to ethical reasons). The purpose of the nasal occlusion is
to induce a reproducible degree of drive and motor recruitment within the sys-
tem18. From this response, the relative activity of hemidiaphragm function can be
assessed under eupnea. To ensure of accuracy in reporting, if no activity was
demonstrated in the crural region of the hemidiaphragm the sternal and costal
regions of the muscle were also assessed for function. Animals which we report as
having no EMG activity in the crural diaphragm also showed an absence of activity
in the other two regions of the muscle.
For pharmacological assessment of diaEMG activity, drugs were administered
both through a tail vein cannula or through intraspinal injection using the same
method described above. Animals were dosed with either serotonin (100 mg kg−1
i.v.; 120 μg kg−1 intraspinal; Sigma) or cinanserin (5 mg kg−1 i.v.; 100 mg kg−1
intraspinal; Tocris).
If neural tracing was to be performed this occurred following removal of the
electrodes. In all animals, the abdominal muscles were sutured together (3-0 vicryl)
and the skin closed with wound clips. Buprenorphine and saline were given s.c.
with analgesics maintained for up to 3 days.
All EMG recordings were performed with the animal under ketamine–xylazine
anaesthesia as is typical within the field55. Due to the effect of these anaesthetics,
the amplitude and frequency of all our output measures is likely to be reduced
compared to that of an unanaesthetised animal56. It is doubtful that this has led to
us under-reporting the degree of spontaneous recovery in our model, as reported
endogenous recovery of ipsilateral nerve and muscle activity following C2Hx has
occurred under similar conditions49,50. However, this potentially means that the
scale of the recovery reported within this manuscript is an underestimation of that
actually achieved.
Respiratory frequency, amplitude and bursting activity were determined from
each diaEMG trace in 30 s time windows. Amplitude was assessed in relation to the
maximal amount achieved for that hemidiaphragm (averaged over three breaths)
through the occlusion period to ensure results were not biased by a slight alteration
in electrode placement. CTA was performed using CED analysis software (Spike2).
CTA facilitated in determining the initiation of inspiration and expiration for
animals displaying tonic activity within the EMG trace of the ipsilateral
hemidiaphragm. Amplitude was then assessed as stated above. Statistical analysis
was performed using a one-way ANOVA with post-hoc Bonferroni (SPSS or
GraphPad Prism). Animals from any group or experiment which showed no
ipsilateral EMG activity were defined as non-responders.
Plethysmography recordings and analysis. Individual animals were placed in
Perspex plethysmography chambers (DSI). Chamber temperature was monitored
throughout the experiment. Airflow within the chamber was maintained at 1.8 L
min−1 using flow controllers and hypoxia (10% O2) and hypercapnia (5% CO2)
were administered using pre-mixed supplies (AirGas). Levels of O2 and CO2
flowing through the chamber were assessed using gas analysers (ADInstruments,
Gas Analyzer ML206). Prior to each recording, the chambers air-tight seal was
assessed by injecting a 0.5 mL calibration volume into the chamber and observing
the stability of the square pressure change. The same injection volume was later
used to calibrate tidal volume (VT) changes in respiratory activity. The animals
core body temperature was assessed at the conclusion of each experiment using a
rectal thermometer (Physitemp). Through the plethysmography recording
(ADInstruments), rates of ventilation (VE) through baseline (normal air), hypoxia
and hypercapnia were assessed. Baseline measurements were conducted every 10
min over the course of a 60-min acclimation period, after which the animal
received 5 min interval of 10% O2 then 5% CO2. VE was assessed when the
chamber was sealed (at the end of each exposure for 30 s) by bypassing airflow to
the chamber. Statistical comparisons were made between treatment groups and
within plethysmography measurements using one-way or two-way, repeated-
measures ANOVA with post-hoc Bonferroni (SPSS).
Forelimb function assessments. Behavioural assessments of forelimb function
were selected to minimise possible impact on respiratory parameters. As uncon-
trolled respiratory training was not desired, forelimb function was determined
through assessments which involved monitoring behaviour that the animals per-
formed naturally. This included the forelimb asymmetry test and the grooming
test, both adapted from Gensel et al.57. Baseline values were taken 3 months after
injury and prior to ChABC/NaCl administration or Nx/IH conditioning following
5 days of acclimation to the chamber and then weekly following treatment
application. Statistical comparisons were made between treatment groups and
within behavioural measurements using two-way, repeated-measures ANOVA
with post-hoc Bonferroni (SPSS).
For the forelimb asymmetry test, animals were placed in a transparent Perspex
cylinder (diameter = 20 cm; height = 48 cm) with food treats placed on a grid at
the top. Spontaneous exploratory behaviour was recorded over 5 min. The number
of times the animal placed its left, right, or both forepaws on the side of the
cylinder was scored under slow motion movie playback for weight supported
behaviours. Scoring of limb contact occurred as defined by Gensel et al.57.
Placement was scored for an individual limb if the contralateral forelimb did not
make contact with the cylinder within 0.5 s of the original limb placement. Both
limbs were scored if such contact occurred within a 0.5 s time frame. When moving
along the side of the cylinder (where both paws change position), again a score for
both limbs was given if it occurred within the 0.5 s time frame. However, if one
limb remained in its original position, no score was given until the limb was
moved.
For the grooming test, and following the forelimb asymmetry test, cool
blackcurrant flavoured water was applied to the animal’s head and back using a
transfer pipette or soft gauze. Grooming activity was recorded over a maximal
period of 20 min for both limbs over a minimum of two stereotypical sequences
(lasting ~2–2.5 min). Scoring of maximal limb contact occurred as defined by
Gensel et al.57 during slow motion playback.
Immunohistochemistry, lesion size and tracing. Animals were anaesthetised
through i.p. injection of urethane and perfused intracardially with 250 mL PBS
followed by 300 mL of 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS. The spinal cord and
brain stem were removed and post-fixed in 4% PFA overnight before being
cryoprotected in 30% sucrose. The area from C3 to C6 was sectioned on a cryostat
(Leica Biosystems) at a thickness of 20 or 25 μm and mounted on SuperFrost
coated slides (Fisher Scientific). Tissue was collected utilising the dorsal roots as

 landmarks and collected as a function of distance from the lesion site to ensure
accuracy and consistency in analysis. Five sections from each segmental level were
assessed. The phrenic motor nucleus located in the mediolateral C4 ventral horn
is readily recognizable as a tight cluster of large neurons58.
For immunohistochemistry, mounted sections were washed three times in
either TBS or TBST (TBS with 0.1% Triton X-100) depending on the antigen under
assessment. Sections were then blocked in 10% normal goat serum and 0.1% BSA
in TBS. Sections were incubated overnight in primary antibody at 4 °C. The
following day, the sections were washed three times in TBS and incubated in
the appropriate secondary antibody or avidin substrate for 2 h at room
temperature. After washing three times in TBS, the sections were coverslipped
using Fluorogold mounting medium (Invitrogen) and viewed using a fluorescence
(Leica) or confocal microscope (Zeiss). 2B6 antibody was purchased from
Seikagaku (270432; 1:200), serotonin from Immunostar (20080; 1:1000), 5HT-2c/a
from ABcam (ab37293; 1:100), GFAP (G3893; 1:400) and WFA (L1516; 1:50) from
Sigma, neuronal nuclei (NeuN) from Millipore (MAB377; 1:400) and tropomyosin
receptor kinase B (TrkB) from Biosensis (R121-100; 1:1000). Secondary antibodies
(A-11008; A-11012; A-11005; A-11001; A-21042; A-21044; 1:500) and streptavidin
Alexa Fluor conjugates (S32354; S32356; 1:500) were from Thermo Fisher
Scientific.
For lesion area and volume, six spinal cords were selected for analysis from the
total available using a random number generator. Spinal cord lesion area and
volume were analysed through iron eriochrome cyanine and 1% cresyl violet
staining (Sigma). Following imaging (Leica SCN400 Slide Scanner), the lesioned,
white and grey matter areas in each section were determined automatically
(Photoshop CC7, Adobe). The lesion volume was assessed using equation V = Σ
[transplant area × section thickness × 18 (the number of sections in each sampling
interval)]59. Tissue caudal to that used to assess lesion area/volume was used in
IHC assessment.
For neuronal tracing, 60 μg of Cholera toxin B subunit conjugated to Alexa-
Fluor 488 or 594 (Thermo Fisher Scientific; C34775; C34777; 100% solution) was
injected into the left hemidiaphragm using a Hamilton syringe under microscopy
3 days prior to perfusion. As such, the PMP ipsilateral to the injury was localised.
Based on NeuN staining, the contralateral PMP in each spinal cord section was also
identified. Animals which had undergone over three laparotomies during the
course of the experiment were not subjected to tracing due to ethical considerations
of an additional surgery. In these instances, the PMP was localised through
anatomical location and NeuN staining.
For quantification, the intensity of staining at the defined area of interest was
quantified blindly using NIH Image J software (National Institutes of Health;
http://rsb.in-fo.nih.gov/ij). The intensity of staining was quantified using
monochromatic image and background readings subtracted. Average labelling
intensity was compared between the treatment groups using one-way ANOVA
with post-hoc Bonferroni (SPSS or GraphPad Prism).
NMJ staining, quantification and analysis. Diaphragm NMJs were assessed using
the procedure described by Martin et al.60. Briefly, the diaphragm was dissected
from each animal, stretched, pinned to a Sylgard base (Sigma Aldridge) and
cleaned of connective tissue. Motor axons were labelled with anti-neurofilament
marker (Covance; SMI-312R; 1:1000) and SV2-s (DSHB; 1:10) and detected
with FITC anti-mouse IgG, Fcc1 secondary antibody (Thermo Fisher Scientific;
SV2-s; A10530; 1:100). Rhodamine-conjugated alpha-bungarotoxin (Thermo
Fisher Scientific; T1175; 1:400) was used to label the post-synaptic acetylcholine
receptors (AChR). The muscles were visualised (Leica) and quantified, categorising
each NMJ as either (1) intact, (2) completely denervated, (3) multiply innervated,
(4) thinly innervated, (5) partially innervated. A minimum of 150 NMJs were
assessed blindly for each hemidiaphragm. Confocal images were obtained for
publication (Leica). Differences between groups was determined using one-way
ANOVA with post-hoc Bonferroni (SPSS or GraphPad Prism).
