 Multinational Home Use of Closed-
Loop Control Is Safe and Effective
Diabetes Care 2016;39:1143–1150 | DOI: 10.2337/dc15-2468
OBJECTIVE
To evaluate the efficacy of a portable, wearable, wireless artificial pancreas sys-
tem (the Diabetes Assistant [DiAs] running the Unified Safety System) on glucose
control at home in overnight-only and 24/7 closed-loop control (CLC) modes in
patients with type 1 diabetes.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS
At six clinical centers in four countries, 30 participants 18–66 years old with type 1
diabetes (43% female, 96% non-Hispanic white, median type 1 diabetes duration
19 years, median A1C 7.3%) completed the study. The protocol included a 2-week
baseline sensor-augmented pump (SAP) period followed by 2 weeks of overnight-
only CLC and 2 weeks of 24/7 CLC at home. Glucose control during CLC was
compared with the baseline SAP.
RESULTS
Glycemic control parameters for overnight-only CLC were improved during the night-
time period compared with baseline for hypoglycemia (time <70 mg/dL, primary end
point median 1.1% vs. 3.0%; P < 0.001), time in target (70–180 mg/dL: 75% vs. 61%;
P < 0.001), and glucose variability (coefficient of variation: 30% vs. 36%; P < 0.001).
Similar improvements for day/night combined were observed with 24/7 CLC com-
pared with baseline: 1.7% vs. 4.1%, P < 0.001; 73% vs. 65%, P < 0.001; and 34% vs.
38%, P < 0.001, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS
CLC running ona smartphone(DiAs) inthe home environment was safe and effective.
Overnight-only CLC reduced hypoglycemia and increased time in range overnight and
increased time in range during the day; 24/7 CLC reduced hypoglycemia and in-
creased time in range both overnight and during the day. Compared with over-
night-onlyCLC,24/7 CLC provided additional hypoglycemiaprotection during theday.
In the past decade, the diabetes community has seen unprecedented advances in
artificial pancreas (AP) technology, which moved from short-term inpatient studies
to long-term trials at home using wireless, portable, wearable AP systems. A com-
prehensive review of the early developments in the AP field and of the first inpatient
closed-loop control (CLC) studies can be found in a Perspectives in Diabetes article
by Cobelli, Renard, and Kovatchev (1), and several recent reviews highlight addi-
tional progress in this field (2–6). A notable achievement in AP technology was the
introduction of the first portable, wearable AP platformdthe Diabetes Assistant
(DiAs) (7)ddeveloped by our group at the University of Virginia (UVA) and first
tested in outpatient trials in Italy and in France in October 2011 (8). DiAs was built
using an Android smart phone as a computational hub and included an AP graphical

 user interface designed for the patient (9)
and a web-based remote monitoring sys-
tem for use by the study team (10). The
defining characteristic of DiAs is its capa-
bility to switch between different modes
of operation, depending on patient pref-
erence and signal availability (7,9).
Using DiAs as the medical platform,
we previously tested and validated two
modular closed-loop algorithms (the
Unified Safety System [USS], developed
at UVA, and the Modular Model Predic-
tive Control, developed by the interna-
tional AP study group) in gradually less
structured and less monitored settings,
following a pathway to achieve eventual
regulatory approval (11). This pathway
included several feasibility and safety
trials in hotel settings (8,12,13), summer
camp studies testing DiAs in children
with diabetes (14,15), and the recently
completed overnight (16) and 42-h
dinner-overnight (17) trials of CLC at
home. Here, we describe the first longer-
term use of DiAs–USS Virginia at home
using a completely wireless and portable,
wearable AP system. The goal of this study
was to provide safety and efficacy data for
the DiAs–USS Virginia AP system in the
home environment with the aim of sup-
porting preliminary data for the next
step in the development pathwayda
large-scale clinical trial to establish CLC
as a viable treatment modality for type 1
diabetes.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS
The protocol, conducted at six clinical
centers in the U.S., Italy, France, and Israel,
was approved by each institutional or
independent review board, and writ-
ten informed consent was obtained
from each participant. An independent
Data and Safety Monitoring Board
provided oversight. The study is listed on
www.clinicaltrials.gov (clinical trial reg.
no. NCT02137512). Details of the proto-
col are available online (http://www
.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02137512);
key aspects are summarized herein.
Major eligibility criteria included age
18–69 years, type 1 diabetes duration of
at least 1 year, use of an insulin pump for
at least 6 months, A1C ,10.0%, continu-
ous access to internet, cell phone service,
and a computer at home. Additional eli-
gibility criteria included commitment
from a companion living with the partici-
pant to take part in all training activities,
to be knowledgeable of the participant’s
location at all times, and to be available
to provide assistance when the system
was used at night. Exclusions included
diabeticketoacidosisorseverehypoglyce-
mia with seizure or loss of consciousness
in the prior 12 months and hypoglycemia
unawareness defined as a score of $3
on a 0–7 scale by a Clarke Hypoglycemia
Unawareness Questionnaire. Other exclu-
sions included the presence of one of a
variety of medical conditions, laboratory
abnormalities, or medications that were
considered to affect study participation.
Closed-Loop System
The CLC system included the following
components: 1) DiAs, a smart-phone
medical platform; 2) Dexcom G4 Platinum
connected to DiAs via continuous glucose
monitor(CGM)receiverandUSB-Bluetooth
relay hardware (SmartLoop LLC; New York,
NY); 3) Roche Accu-Chek insulin pump
connected to DiAs via wireless Blue-
tooth; 4) remote monitoring server con-
nected to DiAs via 3G or local Wi-Fi
network; and 5) modular CLC algorithm
running on DiAs, which is of control-to-
range class.
In this trial, DiAs operated in the fol-
lowing modes.
Sensor-Only Mode
This is the default mode any time the
DiAs is connected with a CGM but has
no connection with the insulin pump. In
this mode, the pump operates in its
standard open-loop (OL) manner while
DiAs provides hypo- and hyperglycemia
alerts implemented as traffic-light sig-
nals (green/yellow/red light) (9) and
data transfer to a server for remote
monitoring and diagnostics (10).
Pump Mode or OL Control Mode
In this mode, the DiAs control algo-
rithms are not active, and the system
delivers the normal basal rates as pro-
grammed in the DiAs insulin profile set-
tings. Pump mode also tracks insulin on
board and allows the user to issue meal
and correction boluses. If DiAs loses com-
munication with the pump, DiAs will re-
vert to either sensor-only mode (if a CGM
is connected) or stopped mode (if no
CGM is connected) and the insulin
pump will revert to the patient’s preprog-
rammed basal rates within 30 min.
CLC Mode
The algorithms deployed in the USS Vir-
ginia use a modular architecture (18,19)
composed of the safety supervision (20),
hyperglycemia mitigation, and basal
rate modules. Insulin corrections are ad-
ministered by the hyperglycemia mitiga-
tionmodule ifglucose levels arepredicted
to exceed the upper limit of a preset
glucose range, e.g., 180 mg/dL, and the
module is designed to maintain glucose
between 70 and 180 mg/dL during the
day. The basal rate module is designed to
slide its glucose target from 160 mg/dL
during the daytime down to 120 mg/dL
by wake-up time in the morning (15,16).
The system uses as a base the patient’s
underlying insulin pump parameters.
Meals are announced using the DiAs
meal screen (9), and upon meal announce-
ment the system recommends premeal
boluses.
Safety Mode
This is a variant of CLC mode in which
only the safety supervision module (20)
is active so that the system can reduce
insulin to prevent hypoglycemia but
cannot exceed OL basal insulin delivery.
Per protocol, this mode was to be used
whenever the participant was driving,
exercising, or performing any poten-
tially dangerous activity.
Participants were asked to remain in
CLC whenever feasible and permitted by
protocol but were able to switch to
pump or sensor mode as needed. Partic-
ipants were instructed to perform fin-
gerstick blood glucose checks after
hypo- or hyperglycemia red light alerts
and to treat with carbohydrate or correc-
tive insulin as specified in a participant
user guide. Manual correction boluses in
the absence of any traffic light alerts were
permitted, but participants were encour-
aged to rely on automated insulin dosing
whenever feasible. Home use of the sys-
tem included all the activities of normal
daily living, including eating, going to
work, sleeping, exercising, etc.
Study Protocol
Depending on the participant’s current
experience with CGM use (17 of the 30
enrolled were active CGM users at en-
rollment), the participant initially spent
0–3 weeks using CGM at home followed
by a 2-week period at home using both
the study pump and CGM. This 2-week
period of sensor-augmented pump
(SAP) therapy at home was considered
the baseline period to be compared with
the 2 weeks of overnight-only CLC sys-
tem use and 2 weeks of a 24 h per day
and 7 days per week (24/7) CLC system

 use at home. After this baseline SAP pe-
riod, participants and study companions
completed a 12-h training session with
the DiAs system in OL control (OLC)
mode in either a clinical or transitional
nonclinical setting. The participant pro-
ceeded to use the DiAs in OLC mode
for a 1-week period at home. Upon com-
pletion, the participant and companion
returned to the clinic or transitional
nonclinical setting such as a hotel for a
48-h training session of use of the DiAs
in CLC and safety modes. The partici-
pants then completed 3–5 days of trial
use of DiAs in overnight-only CLC fol-
lowed by 2 weeks of overnight-only CLC
use at home, a 3- to 5-day trial period of
DiAs in 24/7 CLC mode, and 2 weeks of
24/7 CLC use at home. During the periods
of at-home CLC use, remote safety mon-
itoring was available to clinical staff who
followed specific guidelines for interven-
ing and contacting a participant or com-
panion should there be a technical issue
or safety concern. As an additional safety
precaution, participants also were con-
tacted daily by study staff during the 3-
to 5-day trial periods of CLC use at home.
Adverse event reporting included any
untoward medical occurrence or unex-
pected occurrence in a study participant
including severe hypoglycemia (which
was defined as an event that required
assistance of another person to adminis-
ter oral carbohydrate, glucagon, or other
resuscitative actions), hyperglycemia re-
sulting in ketoacidosis, and any study or
device-related event.
Statistical Methods
The primary outcome was CGM sensor
glucose percent time ,70 mg/dL, which
was computed separately for each of
the three 2-week study phases. The
two primary comparisons were the
change from baseline in the percent
time ,70 mg/dL during overnight-only
CLC and during 24/7 CLC. A sample size
of N = 30 participants was estimated to
provide ;85% power to detect a 33% re-
duction in the percent time ,70 mg/dL
during the 24/7 CLC compared with base-
line SAP, assuming a two-tailed paired
t test and a type I error of 5%.
Safety and basic system performance
analyses included all participants. Effi-
cacy glycemic analyses excluded one
participant for whom baseline data
were unavailable due to a broken CGM
receiver, leaving N = 29 included in
analysis. Similarly, insulin analyses ex-
cluded one participant for whom base-
line pump data were lost, leaving N = 29
included in analysis. Downloaded CGM
readings during times when DiAs was
inactive or not receiving data during
the overnight CLC (7% of the total
data) and 24/7 CLC (4% of the total
data) were excluded from the analysis
(results were similar when using all
CGM receiver data from the two CLC
phases). Paired t tests for normally dis-
tributed metrics or the signed-rank test
for skewed distributions were used to
compare baseline versus overnight-
only CLC and baseline SAP versus 24/7
CLC overall and separately by daytime
(0700–2300 h) and nighttime (2300–0700 h).
Paired t tests to compare overnight-only
CLC versus 24/7 CLC were added as post
hoc analyses.
No adjustment was made for multiple
comparisons. All P values are two tailed,
and analyses were performed using SAS
9.4 software.
RESULTS
Characteristics of the 30 participants
were as follows: median age 44 years
(ranged 18–66), 57% male, 96% Caucasian,
median BMI 25 kg/m2 (interquartile range
[IQR] 23, 27), median type 1 diabetes
duration 19 years (IQR 13, 28), median
total daily units of insulin per kg 0.57 (IQR
0.42, 0.72), and median A1C 7.3% (IQR
7.1, 7.7) (Supplementary Table 1). All par-
ticipants completed the full 2 weeks of
both the overnight-only and 24/7 phases.
Nighttime (2300–0700 h) sensor glu-
cose metrics were significantly improved
during overnight-only CLC compared with
baseline. Median time ,70 mg/dL drop-
ped from 3.0% during baseline to 1.1%
during overnight-only CLC (P , 0.001)
(Table 1 and Fig. 1); median time in tar-
get, 70–180 mg/dL, increased from 61 to
75% (P , 0.001); median time .180
mg/dL dropped from 37 to 24% (P ,
0.001); mean glucose dropped from 163
to 150 mg/dL (P = 0.002) (Fig. 2); and
median coefficient of variation dropped
from 36 to 30% (P , 0.001). Sensor glu-
cose metrics (day and night pooled) also
wereimprovedduringthe24/7 CLCphase
compared with baseline SAP. Median
time ,70 mg/dL dropped from 4.1% dur-
ing baseline SAP to 1.7% during 24/7 CLC
(P , 0.001) (Table 1 and Figs. 1 and 3),
median time in target 70–180 mg/dL
increased from 65 to 73% (P , 0.001),
median time .180 mg/dL dropped from
32 to 25% (P = 0.001), and median coef-
ficient of variation dropped from 38 to
34% (P , 0.001). Mean glucose was not
significantly different (157 vs. 153 mg/dL;
P = 0.14). Daytime hypoglycemia, time in
range, hyperglycemia, and coefficient of
variation also were improved during 24/7
CLC (P # 0.02) (Table 1). Results for
other glucose metrics are shown in
Supplementary Table 2.
Similarly, nighttime sensor glucose
metrics were significantly improved dur-
ing the 24/7 CLC phase compared with
baseline SAP. Nighttime median time
,70 mg/dL dropped from 3.0% during
baseline to 0.4% during 24/7 CLC (P ,
0.001) (Table 1 and Fig. 1); median time
in target, 70–180 mg/dL, increased from
61 to 72% (P , 0.001); median time
.180 mg/dL dropped from 37 to 27%
(P , 0.001); mean glucose dropped
from 163 to 154 mg/dL (P = 0.03) (Fig.
2); and median coefficient of variation
dropped from 36 to 32%; (P , 0.001).
Trends toward improved time in
range 70–180 mg/dL were observed
even for participants who already had
good control ($65% in range) at base-
line (Fig. 3, Supplementary Table 3, and
Supplementary Fig. 1). Among the 14
participants with baseline time in range
$65%, the median improvement for
overall daytime and nighttime was 5%
during overnight-only CLC and 2% dur-
ing 24/7 CLC. Corresponding median im-
provements for the 15 participants with
baseline time in range ,65% were 12%
and 13%, respectively.
In a post hoc analysis, daytime median
time ,70 mg/dL, which was 3.2% during
overnight-only CLC, was further reduced
to 2.3% during 24/7 CLC (P , 0.001) (Ta-
ble 1 and Figs. 1 and 2). Daytime mean
glucose; median time in target, 70–180
mg/dL; and median time .180 mg/dL
were not significantly different (P = 0.07,
0.49, and 0.61 respectively) comparing
24/7 CLC and overnight-only CLC.
For nighttime only, the median total
delivered insulin was 1.26 units/h (IQR
1.04, 1.61) during baseline SAP, 1.28
units/h (IQR 0.95, 1.59) during over-
night-only CLC, and 1.23 units/h (IQR
0.94, 1.75) during 24/7 CLC. For overall
daytime and nighttime, the median total
delivered insulin was 1.78 units/h (IQR
1.56, 2.07), 1.74 units/h (IQR 1.53, 2.22),
and 1.83 units/h (IQR 1.46, 2.38), re-
spectively (Supplementary Fig. 2).

 There were no cases of severe hypo-
glycemia, diabetic ketoacidosis, or other
serious adverse events during the trial.
The system performed well in terms
of connectivity with the CGM sensor and
delivery of recommended amounts of
insulin (Supplementary Table 4), al-
though participants were instructed on
how to reconnect devices to the DiAs, as
this was needed on some occasions.
At the conclusion of the study, partici-
pants completed a questionnaire regard-
ing their experience with the DiAs–USS
Virginia. In general, the experience was
reported as positive. Suggestions for im-
provements or enhancements in the sys-
tem are summarized in Supplementary
Appendix A.
CONCLUSIONS
In this study, we demonstrated that glu-
cose control was significantly improved
during both overnight-only and 24/7
CLC compared with baseline SAP. In
the overnight period, this included
both an increased time in range and a
reduction in hypoglycemia. The control
strategy of tightening the glucose target
overnight from a starting point of
160 mg/dL down to 120 mg/dL 3 h later
ensures that the algorithm is less ag-
gressive when the effect of insulin is an-
ticipated to be greatest overnight and
more aggressive once steady state is
achieved and the insulin resistance as-
sociated with the dawn phenomenon is
occurring (16). Hence, even though par-
ticipants received more insulin between
0100 and 0500 h during CLC relative
to baseline SAP, it was dosed in a manner
that reduced hyperglycemia but did not sig-
nificantly contribute to hypoglycemia.
The inclusion of 2 weeks each of over-
night-only CLC and 24/7 CLC interven-
tions allowed us to assess whether
there was an incremental benefit to us-
ing the closed-loop system 24/7 versus
during the overnight period alone. De-
spite the challenges of normal daily liv-
ing, overnight-only and 24/7 CLC were
both superior to SAP in terms of glucose
time in range during the day and over
24 h. While many early adopters of a
closed-loop system will use the system
24/7, we envision that there will be
others who will prefer to use the system
only at night. Hence, it is clinically rele-
vant that overnight-only CLC provided
benefit in overall glycemia, not only in
the overnight period when algorithmic

 insulin modulation and predictive alerts
were active, but also the following day
when the user was back in OLC mode.
The majority of this effect occurred in
the morning hours (i.e., 0700–1100 h),
likely the result of an improved fasting
glucose value prior to breakfast insulin
dosing and perhaps also improved con-
trol of hepatic glucose output after
overnight CLC use. Alternatively, some
of the improvement might have come
from the user being more engaged
with DiAs than with SAPdi.e., monitor-
ing DiAs more closely than traditional
SAP sensor and pump. In the current
study for the overnight-only CLC arm,
DiAs was manually switched to CLC at
bedtime and the system automatically
reverted to OLC mode at 0700 h for OL
therapy during the day. This contrasts
with the methodology of Brown et al.
(16) and Kropff et al. (21) who used
DiAs–USS Virginia for overnight-only
CLC and then transitioned to the Accu-
Chek Spirit Combo plus Dexcom G4 Plat-
inum (without DiAs) for OLC during the
day. These investigators also observed
improved daytime and 24-h glucose
control with the overnight-only CLC
system compared with SAP despite the
absence of DiAs for OLC during the
day, suggesting that there may be ben-
eficial physiologic effects imparted by
overnight CLC that are independent
from any additional benefit of the DiAs
platform. Indeed, other investigators
using overnight-only CLC have reported
similar results. Thabit et al. (22) re-
ported a beneficial effect from overnight-
only CLC use in children and adolescents
that extended over the full 24-h period,
and Hovorka et al. (23) found that overnight-
only CLC resulted in lower glucose levels
for 3.5 h after stopping CLC. The longest
home study that demonstrated this car-
ryover effect was performed by Nimri
et al. (24) using MD-Logic overnight-
only CLC for 6 weeks and showing a
10 mg/dL reduction in the average
daytime glucose levels with signifi-
cantly lower insulin levels compared
with SAP.
Similar to our results, other groups
using overnight-only CLC compared
with SAP at home have demonstrated
increased time in range and reduced
time in hypoglycemia in the overnight
period (16,21–24). In contrast to the
adult-only population of the current
study, three of these investigations in-
cluded both adolescents and adults
with type 1 diabetes (22–24). Bihormo-
nal 24/7 CLC was evaluated in an inpa-
tient facility as well as a diabetes camp
setting for three consecutive nights
where participants were randomized
to different sequences of single-hormone
CLC, bihormonal CLC, and conven-
tional insulin pump therapy (i.e., OLC)
(25–27). Bihormonal CLC resulted in
comparable time in euglycemia com-
pared with single-hormone CLC and
less time spent in hypoglycemia (,4.0
mmol/L or 72 mg/dL) compared with
OL and single-hormone CLC (25–27).
Leelarathna et al. (28) evaluated 8
days of SAP or CLC insulin delivery in
random order in 17 adults with type 1
diabetes. During the home phase, the
percentage of time with glucose in the
target range was significantly higher
during CLC compared with SAP. How-
ever, contrary to the current study,
time spent below target was compara-
ble between 24/7 CLC and SAP. Possible
differences likely come from the algo-
rithm designdin our case, the algo-
rithm is equipped with a dedicated
safety system specifically responsible
for the prevention of hypoglycemia.
In the current study, hypoglycemia
,70 mg/dL was reduced in the over-
night period by overnight-only CLC and
in both the day and night periods by
24/7 CLC compared with SAP. However,
overnight-only CLC did not reduce hypo-
glycemia ,70 mg/dL during the day
when the control algorithms were inac-
tive. Hence, 24/7 closed loop offers an

 additional benefit of hypoglycemia pro-
tection during times of system use during
the day. Hyperglycemia defined as time
spent .180 mg/dL was reduced both at
night and during the day by both over-
night-only and 24/7 CLC compared with
SAP. Although a significant reduction in
daytime hyperglycemia was seen with
CLC, daytime meal challenges continue
to be an obstacle for tight daytime glu-
cose control with CLC. This is not unex-
pected given the mismatch in insulin
activity and meal carbohydrate absorp-
tion with the current insulin analogs.
The home environment provided typi-
cal daily challenges of real-life. Some of
the predicted distractions included work
and school schedules, children, travel,
and a variety of meal and exercise sched-
ules. However, certain aspects of the
functionality and performance of the sys-
tem in the home environment were not
predictable at the outset, such as how the
system would perform when changing
from Wi-Fi to 3G, during daylight saving
time, or when system anomalies caused
unexpected date and time changes. In the
case of the DiAs–USS Virginia, fail-safe
modes allowed the insulin pump to inde-
pendently resume preprogrammed basal
rates in the event of any failure of the
DiAs or the control modules and an alert
was sent to a physician.
One of the major differences between
this trial and many previous outpatient
investigations of CLC is that the system
used was completely portable and wire-
less, giving participants freedom to carry
on their normal activities. Full wireless
connectivity will continue to be an im-
portant feature of CLC, as the equip-
ment burden without it would be
much more cumbersome to the user
and may limit applications of use. Fortu-
nately, additional rapid advancements
in the CGM field have occurred in the
past year and the Dexcom G5 transmit-
ter will be able to directly communicate
with a cell phone for future iterations of
DiAs-AP systems.
As part of a multinational, multicenter
study, we tested our system in a diverse
group of patients with type 1 diabetes
over a wide range of ages, duration of
diabetes, baseline A1C, BMI, total daily
insulin, and eating schedules (e.g., Euro-
pean vs. American mealtimes) and dem-
onstrated that the system is safe and
effective across borders. Baseline A1C
was reasonably good (median 7.3%);
hence, extrapolation of these results to
populations with suboptimal control is
not possible. Since our hybrid AP system
is initialized with the participant’s base-
line pump parameters, only participants
who were actively using predefined
pump parameters were eligible. By de-
sign, participants with A1C $10% were
excluded, as poor baseline diabetes con-
trol may be indicative of either noncom-
pliance with the present insulin pump
therapy or problematic pump settings
at baseline. Adaptive AP systems and
AP systems using an initial optimization
of the pump parameters may be less de-
pendent on baseline pump parameters
and allow for participation of individuals
with initial A1C .10%. For those people
with baseline A1C of ;7%, a threefold
reduction in hypoglycemia offers a
safety layer and reassurance, while
automated insulin delivery may allevi-
ate the psychological burden of inten-
sive treatment. In general, patients in
good control would be one of the sub-
groups to benefit most from CLC owing
to its power to reduce hypoglycemia
without compromising A1C. For those
with higher baseline A1C values, the AP
system should aim to reduce A1C with-
out increasing the occurrence of hypo-
glycemia. Both of these populations
are being studied in an upcoming large
trial.
Since this was the first use of DiAs–
USS Virginia outside of a research setting,
safety measures included self-monitoring
of blood glucose (SMBG) testing seven
times daily and the inclusion of only
those participants with preserved hypo-
glycemia awareness. The imposed fin-
gerstick schedule may have resulted in
increased postprandial insulin correction
dosing above baseline, although this
would be anticipated to be similar in
both the control and experimental
arms, as the fingerstick schedule was
similar in each. Future studies should
not impose this type of monitoring
schedule, as current CGM technology is

 sufficiently accurate to catch impending
hypo- and hyperglycemia events, and
the Dexcom G5 Mobile has already
achieved a replacement claim in Europe.
Additionally, patients using AP systems
at home are not likely to continue
with this degree of SMBG testing in
the long run. AP systems should be eval-
uated for performance using the mini-
mum number of SMBG tests required to
maintain CGM calibration, as this will
likely be the fewest SMBG tests em-
ployed by users of commercial AP sys-
tems at home.
A limitation of the current study is the
lack of a randomized crossover design of
SAP, overnight-only CLC, and 24/7 CLC.
However, the primary goal was to pro-
vide evidence of the safety and efficacy
of such a wireless and portable system
in the home environment. The future
planned large-scale trial will use a ran-
domized parallel-group design powered
for A1C reduction.
In conclusion, use of a completely por-
table and wireless hybrid APsystem in the
home environment increases time in
range and reduces hypoglycemia when
the closed-loop system is active. Longer
studies are needed to further establish
safety, clinical outcomes over time, us-
ability, and system adaptation. Addi-
tional studies in children, those with
hypoglycemia unawareness, and those
with suboptimal control are presently
ongoing.
