 Perspective
Connecting Cancer to Its Causes Requires
Incorporation of Effects on Tissue
Microenvironments
James DeGregori
Abstract
In a recent article in Science, Tomasetti and colleagues present
an expanded model for cancer risk, which they claim demon-
strates the relative contribution of mutations caused by replica-
tion errors, environment, and heredity. The foundation of this
model is the theory that the overwhelming driver of cancer
risk is mutations. This perspective will present experimental
evidence and evolutionary theory to challenge the basis of
this underlying theory. An argument will be presented that
the mutation-centric model of cancer suggests unrealistic
solutions to cancer and distracts the research community
from more promising approaches that consider tissue context.

The recent article by Tomasetti and colleagues (1) begins with
"It is now widely accepted that cancer is the result of the gradual
accumulation of driver gene mutations that successively increase
cell proliferation." The authors are correct that this paradigm is
widely accepted. Indeed, mutations are necessary for cancer
development. However, by not considering the context depen-
dence of mutational effects on cellular fitness and the effects of
aging and other carcinogenic factors on tissue microenviron-
ments, this paradigm is inadequate to explain links between
cancers and their causes. If this paradigm is fundamentally defi-
cient, the model developed by Tomasetti and colleagues estimat-
ing the contributions of replication-associated mutations (R),
environmental factors (E), and heredity (H) to cancer risk is called
into question.
In their modeling, the impacts of R, E, and H on cancer
incidence are solely ascribed to their effects on mutation occur-
rence (Fig. 1, top). The idea that endogenous and environmental
factors influence cancer development primarily by increasing the
burden of mutations stands in opposition to (i) basic evolution-
ary theory and (ii) substantial evidence to the contrary.
1. The authors are correct that many mutations result from
normal cellular processes (e.g., errors during DNA replication and
oxidative base damage). Whether engendered by intrinsic or
extrinsic causes, base substitutions or modifications and inser-
tions/deletions that escape DNA repair lead to mutations (2). The
modeling by Tomasetti and colleagues rests on the premise that
these mutations limit cancer etiology and thus cancer risk, who
gets cancer and when. Of course, evolution requires mutations
(including epigenetic changes for somatic evolution), but muta-
tions are not the drivers of evolution; they are the substrate upon
which natural selection acts. We know that the evolution of
species does not result from the gradual accumulation of advan-
tageous mutations, but instead reflects adaptation in response to
intermittent environmental changes (3, 4). Similarly, for somatic
evolution, selection on mutations is highly dependent on tissue
context. Mutations that are purged by stabilizing selection in
young, healthy tissues can become positively selected late in life
or in damaged tissue, due to adaptation to altered tissue environ-
ments (Fig. 1, bottom and Fig. 2; e.g., ref. 5). In addition to the role
for tissue changes in altering selective pressures for oncogenic
events, the microenvironment can directly influence the pheno-
type of malignant cells without altering their genetic makeup (6).
In fact, carcinoma cells and reprogrammed melanoma cells can
even contribute to normal tissue architecture when incorporated
into mouse embryos (7, 8). Inherited genetic polymorphisms can
also influence parameters that would be expected to affect malig-
nant phenotypes and the fitness impact of oncogenic mutations,
such as by modulating inflammation and immune function
(often through complex interactions of many alleles; e.g., ref. 9).
By only accounting for mutation occurrence, the impacts of R, E,
and H on tissue microenvironments, immunity, and other non–
cell-autonomous factors are not considered.
2. Numerous studies reveal that the increase in mutational
burden brought about by aging, smoking, and other carcinogenic
exposures cannot explain most of the impact on cancer risk. First,
roughly half of mutations and epigenetic changes occur by matu-
rity (10–12), consistent with the much more rapid cycling of cells
during ontogeny and body growth (Fig. 2; refs. 13, 14). Muta-
tional load changes modestly from maturity to old ages (in well-
powered studies, typically 2- to 3-fold; refs. 10–12), and yet cancer
risk rises exponentially in older ages. Even for smoking, mutations
appear to account for only a fraction of the substantial increase in
associated cancer risk. A recent report examined mutational
burden in 13 cancers associated with smoking (15). Of these
13 cancers, only lung adenocarcinoma and larynx cancer showed
a substantial smoking-dependent increase in mutational burden
(4.5- and 2.5-fold, respectively). Liver and kidney cancers showed
less than 1.5-fold increases, and 9 of the 13 cancers showed no

 significant differences in mutations. Notably, the smoking-asso-
ciated increase in mutations for all cancers combined was only
1.15-fold. Thus, smoking-induced mutations alone cannot
explain the increased risk (up to 110-fold) for various cancers.
Lifetime mutation accumulation in stem cells cannot explain
varying cancer predisposition across tissues and species. A recent
analysis of mutation accumulation in stem cells from human
liver, small intestine, and large intestine showed that very similar
numbers of mutations (roughly 2,500) accumulated per epithe-
lial stem cell in each of these tissues by old age (16). Yet carcinoma
incidence is about 5- and 30-fold higher for the large intestine
relative to liver and small intestine, respectively. For mice, a
similar study showed that stem cells in the large and small
intestines accumulated roughly 250 and 500 mutations in a
lifetime, respectively (17). Thus, each human intestinal stem cell
accumulates 5- to 10-fold more mutations relative to mouse,
likely resulting from the 20- to 30 times longer potential lifespans
for humans compared with laboratory mice. If we consider that
human intestines should have greater than 1,000-fold more cells,
humans should accumulate roughly 10,000-fold more mutations
in this organ than mice in a lifetime. Although similar compar-
isons are not available for stem cells in other tissues, given the
approximately 2,000-fold greater cellularity of a human, overall
mutation load doubtfully explains the similar rates of malignancy
development in mice and humans.
Instead, we need to consider how aging or carcinogens change
tissue microenvironments to increase selection for particular
oncogenic mutations. The role for microenvironmental change
in altering selective pressures is not accounted for in the Tomasetti
and colleagues' model. Just as for organismal evolution, muta-
tions (including epigenetic changes) are required for somatic
evolution and cancer to occur. However, just as for organismal
evolution, context-dependent alterations in the forces of selection
(dependent on age and carcinogen exposure) dictate cancer
timing and incidence (18, 19).
A powerful experimental example of mutations not limiting
cancer incidence comes from mice with heterozygous mutations
in DNA polymerase d that disable its proofreading function (20).
The L604G and L604K mutations increase the rate of somatic
point mutations by 5- and 4-fold and DNA rearrangements by 17-
and 38-fold, respectively. Strikingly, the þ/L604G mice exhibit
lifespans and cancer incidence curves that are similar to wild-
type mice. Thus, a substantial increase in mutational burden
did not significantly increase cancer incidence. The second DNA
polymerase d mutation (L604K) results in earlier, but not
increased, cancer occurrence, a shift that parallels the shortened
lifespans of these mice. Physiologic decline, rather than altered
mutation frequency, better explains altered age-dependent can-
cer risk in þ/L604K mice.
Figure 1.
Models connecting cancer to its causative contexts. Top, according to the current paradigm that forms the foundation for the Tomasetti and colleagues model, the
primary role of R, E, and H in determining cancer risk is through increasing mutational burden in tissue stem cells. Bottom, an alternative model posits that the major
impact for contexts like old age and environmental exposures on cancer risk is through alterations in tissue microenvironments that promote selection for
adaptive mutations that contribute to cancer development. Adaptive mutations could emanate from R, E, and/or H, and increases in mutational burden from R,
E, and/or H should increase cancer risk. However, the impact of cancer-associated factors on selection will have a much greater deterministic role.
Figure 2.
Changing roles of somatic selection in life. Mutations and epigenetic changes
accumulate rapidly during ontogeny and body growth, and then more slowly
postmaturation. Through periods of likely reproduction, stabilizing selection is
dominant in healthy tissue microenvironments, leading to suppression of
oncogenic clonal expansions. Late in life, the degradation of tissue
microenvironments engenders positive selection for adaptive mutations,
leading to oncogenic clonal expansions. The expansion of cell clones bearing
oncogenes increases the risk of cancer.

 Additional arguments against the mutation-centric paradigm
include that oncogenic mutations frequently reduce the somatic
fitness of stem cells in healthy niches (21), that oncogenic muta-
tions are detected in normal tissues at rates that far exceed the
frequencies of associated cancers (e.g., ref. 22), that malignancies
driven by very different numbers of oncogenic mutations (such as
chronic myeloid leukemia compared with most carcinomas)
display similar age-dependent incidence curves (23), and that
larger animals like blue whales do not suffer more cancer than
smaller ones like mice (24). In total, mutation load correlates
poorly with cancer risk across a lifetime, between tissues, for
genotypes within a species, and across species. Therefore, one
cannot estimate the contributions of R, E, and H to cancer
incidence solely by considering their impact on mutations.
Still, as mutations are clearly necessary for cancer development,
should not a model that estimates cancer risk based on contribu-
tions of R, E, and H to mutations have predictive value? The value
should depend on the extent to which mutation occurrence
dictates who gets cancer, how cancer risk relates to known causes,
which tissues it occurs in, and when the cancers develop in life. As
argued above, mutation occurrence correlates poorly with cancer
risk, and many contexts can greatly modulate cancer risk without
similarly impacting mutations. Consider the associations of virus-
es with cancer risk. It is well accepted that oncogenes encoded by
Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) directly contribute to the development
of Burkitt lymphoma (25). However, 90% of humans are esti-
mated to be infected chronically with EBV, and yet Burkitt
lymphoma is very rare, requiring multiple other secondary factors
(e.g., concomitant infection with human immunodeficiency virus
or malarial parasites). Although it is useful to understand the role
of EBV in Burkitt lymphoma pathogenesis, it would not be very
useful to try to understand the risk of this lymphoma based on
EBV infection. Analogously to EBV infection, humans and other
animals (from mice to blue whales) will experience many onco-
genic mutations throughout our lives, and yet only a fraction of us
will develop cancer, likely late in life. Estimating cancer risk,
whether per tissue or per individual, based solely on mutation
causation neglects other key factors involved in cancer evolution
to the extent that such estimates are likely to be misleading.
Adherence to the mutation-centric paradigm, in the face of
abundant evidence opposing it, is likely hindering progress in
cancer research and therapeutic development. Tomasetti, Li, and
Vogelstein propose that we should be able to limit the impact of
cancers that they ascribe to R mutations by improving early
detection and by reducing mutation occurrence, such as by
improving DNA repair (1). Although early detection methods
continue to have a huge impact on cancer mortality (e.g., for colon
cancer), improving DNA repair is doubtfully a realistic or pro-
ductive strategy. Evolutionary theory may suggest more fruitful
approaches. The evolution of large and long-lived animals did not
involve reductions in mutation rates,for example, human somatic
cells have higher mutation rates than yeast and bacteria (26).
Thus, we do not need to lower mutation frequency to prevent or
treat cancer. A more effective strategy for cancer prevention could
be to alter tissue landscapes to limit selection for the inevitable
oncogenic mutations. Therapeutic strategies could be used to alter
the selective value of cancer phenotypes by increasing the fitness
of more benign phenotypes and/or disfavoring malignant geno-
types through modulating tissue parameters, as has been shown
for pH (27), oxygen levels (28), cytokines (5, 29), and the
presence of senescent cells (30). In each case, treatments engen-
dering a tissue microenvironment that better approached that of a
young healthy individual, such as by ameliorating inflammation,
reduced the selective value of malignant or aggressive genotypes
and thus impaired cancer initiation and progression. Although
preventing replication errors is not currently feasible, as these
examples illustrate, we do possess the ability to manipulate
microenvironmental parameters to limit cancer risk or favor more
benign cancer phenotypes.
