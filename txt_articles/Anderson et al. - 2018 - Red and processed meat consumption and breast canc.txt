Abstract 
 
Aim: Red and processed meat may be risk factors for breast cancer due to their iron content, 
administration of oestrogens to cattle, or mutagens created during cooking. We studied the 
associations in UK Biobank, then included the results in a meta-analysis of published cohort 
studies.   
 
Methods: UK Biobank, a general population cohort study, recruited participants aged 40-69 
years. Incident breast cancer was ascertained via linkage to routine hospital admission, cancer 
registry and death certificate data. Univariate and multivariable Cox proportional hazard 
models were used to explore the associations between red and processed meat consumption 
and breast cancer. Previously published cohort studies were identified from a systematic 
review using PubMed and Ovid, and a meta-analysis conducted using a random effects model. 
 
Results: Over a median of seven years follow-up, 4,819 of the 262,195 women developed 
breast cancer. The risk was increased in the highest tertile (>9g/day) of processed meat 
consumption (adjusted HR 1.21, 95% CI 1.08-1.35, p=0.001) Collation with ten previous 
cohort studies provided data on 40,257 incident breast cancers in 1.65 million women. On 
meta-analysis, processed meat consumption was associated with overall (RR 1.06, 95% CI 
1.01-1.11) and post-menopausal (RR 1.09, 95% CI 1.03-1.15), but not pre-menopausal (RR 
0.99, 95% CI 0.88-1.10), breast cancer. In UK Biobank and the meta-analysis, red meat 
consumption was not associated with breast cancer (adjusted HR 0.99 95% CI 0.88-1.12 and 
RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.99-1.08, respectively). 
  
Conclusions: Consumption of processed meat, but not red meat, may increase the risk of 
breast cancer.

1. Introduction 
 
In the United Kingdom, one in eight women will develop breast cancer [1] but more than one-
quarter of cases could be prevented by reduced exposure to exogenous oestrogens, reduced 
obesity, increased physical activity and breastfeeding [1]. There is a lack of consensus on 
whether red and processed meat consumption are risk factors for breast cancer [2]. Four 
meta-analyses have produced conflicting results [3-6] due to wide inclusion criteria resulting 
in the inclusion of very heterogeneous studies. We studied whether red and processed meat 
consumption were associated with the risk of breast cancer in UK Biobank; then included the 
results in a meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies using rigorous inclusion criteria.

2. Materials and methods 
 
2.1. 
UK Biobank 
 
UK Biobank recruited 273,466 women aged 40-69 years from the general population between 
2007 and 2010. Baseline socioeconomic and lifestyle information were collected via   a self-
completed, touch-screen questionnaire and anthropometric measurements taken by trained 
staff. Self-reported moderate and vigorous physical activity were converted to 
METs.min.week-1, and dichotomized to inactive (<600 METs.min.week-1) and active (≥600 
METs.min.week-1). Dietary information was collected using a self-completed food frequency 
questionnaire. Frequency of beef, pork and lamb intake (excluding processed meat) and 
frequency of processed meat intake were recorded. These were converted into probabilities 
of daily consumption, multiplied by normal portion sizes [7], and then weighted by size of 
portion: small 0.5, medium 1.0 or large 1.5. We then derived four categories of red/processed 
meat intake: zero intake and tertiles of consumption for those consuming some. Follow-up 
information (min 5.33 years, max 9.89 years) on the date of first diagnosis of cancer was 
obtained via linkage to three routine administrative databases: cancer registrations, death 
certificates and hospital admissions. Date and cause of death were obtained from death 
certificates held by the National Health Service (NHS) Information Centre (England and 
Wales) and the NHS Central Register Scotland (Scotland). Date and cause of hospital 
admissions were obtained from the Health Episode Statistics (HES) for England and Wales 
and the Scottish Morbidity Record 01 (SMR01) for Scotland. At the time of analysis, mortality 
data were available up to 31 January 2016 and hospital admission and cancer registry data 
until 31 March 2015. Therefore, follow-up was censored at 31 January 2016 or date of death 
if this occurred earlier. There were 54 participants that withdrew consent from UK Biobank at 
the time of analysis. All databases used the International Classification of Diseases and we 
defined breast cancer as ICD10 code C50. 
 
 6 
 
 
 
 
We excluded women with a record of breast cancer at baseline. Cox proportional hazard 
models were used to examine the associations between red/processed meat consumption 
and breast cancer using zero consumption as the referent category. We ran four incremental 
models for each: univariate, multivariable adjusted for sociodemographic factors (age, sex, 
ethnic group and deprivation index); multivariable also adjusted for lifestyle factors (smoking 
status, frequency of alcohol consumption, body mass index and physical activity) and 
multivariable also adjusted for potential dietary confounders (cooked vegetables, raw 
vegetables, and type of bread). We tested for statistical interactions and, where significant, 
sub-group analyses were undertaken. All analyses were repeated after stratifying women into 
pre- and post-menopausal subgroups. In the latter we included use of hormone replacement 
therapy as a covariate in the fully adjusted model. We also conducted landmark analyses, 
excluding the first two years of follow-up. This study was performed under generic ethical 
approval obtained by UK Biobank from the NHS National Research Ethics Service (ref 
11/NW/0382, 17 June 2011). All analyses were undertaken using Stata v14. 
 
2.2. 
Meta-analysis  
 
Two authors (JJA and NDMD) searched Pubmed and Ovid using the search term breast 
cancer combined with meat, red meat, processed meat, preserved meat, pork, beef, veal, 
mutton, lamb, ham, sausage or bacon; consistent with the most recently published meta-
analysis [6]. However, inclusion was restricted to prospective, general population cohort 
studies. We excluded case-control studies and studies that measured only beef intake. Where 
more than one study was conducted on the same cohort, only the most recent was included. 
The last search was conducted on 15 January 2017. Meta-analysis was undertaken using a 
random effects model; stratified by type of meat (red and processed) and outcome (pre-
menopausal, post-menopausal and overall breast cancer). We performed Egger’s and Begg’s 
tests and used funnel plots to assess potential bias. Heterogeneity between the studies was 
tested using the I-squared statistic. All analyses were undertaken using Stata v14.

3. Results  
 
3.1. 
UK Biobank 
 
Of the 273,466 female participants, 262,195 had no record of breast cancer at baseline and, 
therefore, were eligible for inclusion. Of these, 4,819 (1.8%) developed incident breast cancer 
over a median follow-up period of seven years [IQR 6.3 to 7.7]. The participants who 
developed breast cancer were older, more affluent, less physically active, and more likely to 
be white and former smokers, had higher body mass indices, reported lower alcohol and raw 
vegetable intake, but higher intake of red and processed meat (Table 1).  
 
Overall, 3,303 (1.3%) of the 262,195 women had missing data on consumption of red meat; 
of the remainder, 22,435 (8.6%) consumed no red meat, 118,744 (45.3%) consumed <19 
g/day, 43,727 (16.7%) 19-25 g/day and 73,986 (28.2%) >25 g/day. In relation to processed 
meat consumption, 1,089 (0.4%) had missing data and, of the remainder, 32,977 (12.6%) 
consumed none, 101,144 (38.6%) <4 g/day, 71,706 (27.4%) 4-9 g/day and 55,279 (21.1%) 
>9g/day.   
 
In the univariate Cox proportional hazards model, there was a significant overall association 
between red meat consumption and risk of incident breast cancer (Table 2). Adjustment for 
potential sociodemographic confounders attenuated the overall association and, following 
further adjustment for potential lifestyle and dietary confounders, it was no longer statistically 
significant. There were no significant interactions with any of the covariates or menopausal 
status. On sub-group analyses, the associations between red meat consumption and breast 
cancer were not significant in either pre- or post-menopausal women. Landmark analyses, 
 8 
 
 
 
 
excluding the first two years of follow-up, did not alter the results. Supplementary Table 1 
contains the results re-run using the lowest tertile of red meat intake as the referent category.  
 
In the univariate analysis, there was a statistically significant dose-response relationship 
between processed meat consumption and breast cancer (Table 2). Adjustment for potential 
sociodemographic, lifestyle and dietary confounders did not attenuate the results. There was 
a significant dose-response relationship across the tertiles of processed meat consumption; 
whereby participants in the low, medium and highest tertiles of consumption remained 
significantly more likely to develop breast cancer than those with zero intake. In the fully 
adjusted model the results were: <4g/day HR 1.15 95% CI 1.04-1.28, p=0.007; 4-9g/day HR 
1.19 95% CI 1.07-1.33, p=0.002; >9g/day HR 1.21 95% CI 1.08-1.35, p=0.001 (overall ptrend= 
0.005). There was a statistically significant interaction with the intake of cooked vegetables 
(p=0.009). There was a weaker association between processed meat intake and breast cancer 
among participants with the lowest intake of cooked vegetable. This was due to the absolute 
risk already being higher in this sub-group; among participants who ate no processed meat, 
the incidence of breast cancer was 2.46 per 1,000 population per annum among those with 
low intake of cooked vegetables compared with only 2.01 per 1,000 per annum among those 
with high vegetable intake. Among participants who had the highest intake of processed meat, 
the incidence of breast cancer was 2.55 per 1,000 population per annum among those with 
low cooked vegetable intake and 2.35 per 1,000 per annum among those with high intake. 
There was no significant interaction with menopausal status. However, in the sub-group of 
pre-menopausal women, the increased risk of breast cancer only reached statistical 
significance in the highest tertile of processed meat intake (fully adjusted model: <4g/day HR 
1.24 95% CI 0.98-1.57, p=0.069; 4-9g/day HR 1.21 95% CI 0.95-1.54, p=0.131; >9g/day HR 
1.32 95% CI 1.03-1.69, p=0.032). Among post-menopausal women, the risk of breast cancer 
was significantly higher among all groups that consumed processed meat (fully adjusted 
model: <4g/day HR 1.16 95% CI 1.03-1.31, p=0.016; 4-9g/day HR 1.20 95% CI 1.05-1.36, 
p=0.006; >9g/day HR 1.20 95% CI 1.05-1.37, p=0.008). In the landmark analyses, excluding 
 9 
 
 
 
 
the first two years of follow-up, the effect estimates remained unaffected (fully adjusted model: 
<4g/day HR 1.15 95% CI 1.02-1.29, p=0.022; 4-9g/day HR 1.19 95% CI 1.05-1.34, p=0.006; 
>9g/day HR 1.23 95% CI 1.08-1.39, p=0.002).. Supplementary Table 1 shows the results re-
run using the first tertile of processed meat consumption as the reference category.  
 
3.2. 
Meta-analysis 
 
A total of 124 and 84 publications were identified by searching the Pubmed and Ovid 
databases, respectively, of which 78 were excluded as duplicates. The remaining 130 articles 
were screened, together with nine additional publications identified from reference lists. Of 
these, 122 were excluded because they did not satisfy the inclusion criteria. A further five 
studies were excluded due to repeat analyses conducted on the same cohort and two due to 
inadequate exposure information; resulting in ten eligible cohort studies in addition to UK 
Biobank (Figure 1). The ten previous studies comprised a total of 35,438 incident cancers 
occurring in 1,386,799 women [8-17]. Combined with UK Biobank this produced a total of 
eleven studies with data on 40,257 incident cancers in 1,648,994 women (Table 3). 
 
Of the eleven cohort studies, ten reported the association between red meat consumption and 
overall risk of breast cancer; of these, six also reported results separately for pre-menopausal 
and post-menopausal breast cancer. The eleventh study only examined the association with 
post-menopausal breast cancer (Table 3). The ten studies produced a pooled relative risk for 
breast cancer, overall, of 1.03 (95% CI 0.99-1.08) (Figure 2). The funnel plot was reasonably 
symmetrical with one small study outlier (Supplementary Figure 1a) and both Begg’s 
(p=0.210) and Egger’s (p=0.317) tests were non-significant. Overall there was medium level 
heterogeneity (I2 44.0%) that was not statistically significant (p=0.065).  
 
The six studies on pre-menopausal breast cancer produced a pooled relative risk for high 
consumption of red meat of 1.02 (95% CI 0.92-1.11) (Figure 2). Both Begg’s (p=0.573) and 
 10 
 
 
 
 
Egger’s (p=0.272) tests were non-significant indicating no significant publication bias and the 
funnel plot was symmetrical with no study outliers (Supplementary Figure 1b). The level of 
heterogeneity was low (I2 0.0%) and not statistically significant (p=0.530). The pooled relative 
risk for post-menopausal breast cancer, from the six relevant studies, was 1.03 (95% CI 0.97-
1.08) (Figure 2). Both Begg’s (p=0.764) and Egger’s (p=0.483) tests were non-significant and 
the funnel plot was symmetrical with one small study outlier (Supplementary Figure 1c). 
Overall there was low heterogeneity (I2 34.6%) that was not statistically significant (p=0.177).  
 
Of the nine cohort studies on processed meat consumption, eight examined the association 
with overall risk of breast cancer (Figure 3); five of these also studied both pre- and post- 
menopausal breast cancer. The ninth study reported results for post-menopausal breast 
cancer only. For overall risk of breast cancer, the pooled relative risk from the eight studies 
was 1.06 (95% CI 1.01-1.11) (Figure 3). The funnel plot was reasonably symmetrical with one 
small study outlier (Supplementary Figure 2a). Both Egger’s (p=0.141) and Begg’s (p=0.108) 
tests were non-significant indicating no significant publication bias. Overall there was medium 
level heterogeneity (I2 61.5%) that was statistically significant (p=0.011). 
 
The pooled relative risk for pre-menopausal breast cancer, from the five relevant studies, was 
0.99 (95% CI 0.88-1.10) (Figure 3). Both Begg’s (p=1.000) and Egger’s (p=0.662) tests were 
non-significant and the funnel plot was symmetrical with one small study outlier 
(Supplementary Figure 2b). The level of heterogeneity was medium (I2 39.5%) and not 
statistically significant (p=0.158). The six relevant studies produced a pooled relative risk for 
post-menopausal breast cancer of 1.09 (95% CI 1.03-1.15) (Figure 3). Both Begg’s (p=0.348) 
and Egger’s (p=0.570) tests were non-significant and the funnel plot was symmetrical with one 
small study outlier (Supplementary Figure 2c). Overall there was medium heterogeneity (I2 
40.2%) that was not statistically significant (p=0.137).  
 
4. Discussion 
 11 
 
 
 
 
 
Among the 262,195 women in UK Biobank, those who consumed processed meat were at 
higher risk of breast cancer; independent of sociodemographic, lifestyle, obesity, and dietary 
factors included in this study. Our results and the meta-analysis suggested the overall 
association is largely driven by the risk of post-menopausal breast cancer. Red meat 
consumption was not a risk factor for breast cancer in UK Biobank, after adjusting for 
confounding; nor in the meta-analysis.  
 
A number of possible underlying mechanisms have been mooted [18]. Processed meat 
contains high levels of amines, and nitrate and nitrite are commonly added to enhance colour 
and flavour. All are precursors of N-nitroso compounds which are carcinogenic. The added 
nitrate together with the heme iron present in red meat enhances endogenous N-nitroso 
compound formation [17], whereas antioxidants inhibit it [19]. In a randomized controlled trial, 
consumption of processed meat (HR 2.46; 95%CI 1.28–4.72) and dietary heme (HR 2.80, 
95% CI 1.42, 5.54) were both associated with breast cancer in the control arm, but not in the 
intervention arm which was given low-dose anti-oxidants [16,19]. A recent study has 
implicated the high content of N-glycolylneuraminic acic, an animal sugar, as a possible cause 
of chronic inflammation and tumour formation [20]. 
 
The mechanism most extensively studied has been the possible role of cooking. Cooking red 
meat can produce carcinogenic compounds such as heterocyclic amines and polycyclic 
aromatic hydrocarbons [21]. The likelihood of carcinogens being formed varies according to 
the method, temperature and duration of cooking. In a case-control study of 2,386 women with 
breast cancer and 1,703 healthy controls, there was an overall association between red meat 
consumption and breast cancer. However, on sub-group analysis the association was 
significant in women using high temperature cooking methods (OR 1.5, 95% 1.3-1.9, p<0.001) 
but not those using other cooking methods (OR 1.1, 95% CI 0.9-1.3, p=0.429) [21]. A recent 
 12 
 
 
 
 
study found that high intake of smoked meats, that are high in polycyclic aromatic 
hydrocarbons, was associated with mortality from breast cancer [23]. 
 
Because UK Biobank participants are not representative of the general population, summary 
statistics such as disease frequency cannot be generalized; however, estimates of effect size 
can [24]. Repeated 24-hour dietary recall questionnaires are generally more accurate than 
food frequency questionnaires, but take longer to complete, and were only available on a 
minority of UK Biobank participants. Therefore, our study used data from the self-completed 
food frequency questionnaire; the usual methodology adopted in large-scale studies. To date, 
there has been no internal validation of the food frequency data within the UK Biobank 
population. Participants who completed the Oxford WebQ were more likely to be female, white, 
older, more affluent and better educated compared to the rest of UK Biobank participants, 
which may have introduced response bias. Breast cancer was ascertained through a 
combination of hospital admission, cancer registry and death certificate data; therefore, it 
should be reasonably complete and selection bias unlikely. We were able to adjust for a wide 
range of confounders including sociodemographic, lifestyle and dietary factors; however, 
residual confounding is possible in any observational study. Whilst there was some evidence 
of a possible dose relationship, the largest increase in risk of breast cancer was between zero 
and low intake (4g/day) of processed meat. Women who ate no processed meat may differ in 
other, unmeasured, ways or may have changed their diet as a result of ill-health. In order to 
check for potential reverse causation, we repeated the analyses using landmark analyses and 
the results were similar. A limitation of our study was the inability to determine whether the 
associations varied according to the hormonal receptor status of tumours, due to lack of these 
data in UK Biobank. Our meta-analysis was the largest to date, including data on 40,257 
incident cancers in over 1.6 million women from 11 independent cohorts. A limitation of our 
meta-analysis was the inconsistent approaches adopted by the individual studies in the 
number and range of confounders they included; therefore, we used a random effects 
approach to allow for differences in effect size between different study populations.  
 13 
 
 
 
 
 
We obtained a similar pooled estimate as Guo et al. for processed meat consumption [6] but 
a non-significant pooled estimate for red meat consumption. The latter is due to our meta-
analysis employing stricter inclusion criteria and methodology. We included only cohort 
studies; did not include duplicate information from repeat studies on the same cohort; included 
only estimates based on comparisons of the highest and lowest intake categories, excluded 
estimates based on increments in intake; included only evaluations of red meat and processed 
meat intake; and excluded studies that analysed total meat consumption or only selected types 
of red meat, such as beef. In comparison, the most recently published meta-analysis, by Guo 
et al., included three nested case-control studies [25-27] as well as cohort studies, and treated 
odds ratios as equivalent to relative risks [26,27]. One of the nested case-control studies 
produced atypically high estimates of the associations but these were derived from a study 
population with much higher levels of meat consumption in the highest category than our UK 
Biobank study. Guo et al. also included two studies that were undertaken on the same cohort 
as two other included studies [15,28]. Furthermore, they included a study on 6,156 women 
who participated in the National Health Epidemiologic Follow-up Study, which compared 
women according to beef, rather than total red meat, intake [29]. Therefore, the groups 
reporting no and low beef intake will have included women who consumed other forms of red 
meat; such as pork, lamb and game. Because of our tighter inclusion criteria, the heterogeneity 
of the studies included in our meta-analysis was lower than those included in the meta-
analysis conducted by Guo et al: I2 for red meat 44.0% versus 62.2%.  
A previous meta-analysis based on estimates of incremental intake of red and processed meat 
conducted by the World Cancer Research fund reported similar findings to this study [30]. 
They found that there was no association between red meat intake and breast cancer, while 
the pooled relative risk for 50g/day intake of processed meat and post-menopausal breast 
cancer was 1.13, 95% CI 0.99-1.29.  
 
 14 
 
 
 
 
In conclusion, high consumption of processed meat was associated with higher overall risk of 
breast cancer; but this association was driven by post-menopausal breast cancer. After taking 
account of confounding, red meat consumption was not associated with an overall risk of 
breast cancer either in UK Biobank or the meta-analysis.
