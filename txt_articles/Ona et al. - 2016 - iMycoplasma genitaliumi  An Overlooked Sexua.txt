Mycoplasma genitalium is a facultative anaerobic organism and a recognized cause of nongonococcal urethritis in men. In women,
M. genitalium has been associated with cervicitis, endometritis, pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), infertility, susceptibility to
human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and adverse birth outcomes, indicating a consistent relationship with female genital tract
pathology. The global prevalence of M. genitalium among symptomatic and asymptomatic sexually active women ranges between
1 and 6.4%. M. genitalium may play a role in pathogenesis as an independent sexually transmitted pathogen or by facilitating
coinfection with another pathogen. The long-term reproductive consequences of M. genitalium infection in asymptomatic
individuals need to be investigated further. Though screening for this pathogen is not currently recommended, it should be
considered in high-risk populations. Recent guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control regarding first-line treatment for PID
do not cover M. genitalium but recommend considering treatment in patients without improvement on standard PID regimens.
Prospective studies on the prevalence, pathophysiology, and long-term reproductive consequences of M. genitalium infection in the
general population are needed to determine if screening protocols are necessary. New treatment regimens need to be investigated
due to increasing drug resistance.
1. Introduction
M. genitalium was first identified in 1980 from the urethral
specimens of two men with nongonococcal urethritis (NGU)
[1, 2]. Its prevalence in men presenting with urethritis is
between 30 and 40% [1, 3]. Further, the presence of M.
genitalium in men is associated with a 5.5-fold increased
risk of NGU [4, 5]. In women, M. genitalium has been
linked to cervicitis, endometritis, pelvic inflammatory disease
(PID), infertility, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV),
and adverse birth outcomes [1]. In the United States, the
prevalence of M. genitalium among women is thought to
be around 1%, slightly higher than Neisseria gonorrhoeae
prevalence (0.4%) and less than Chlamydia trachomatis
prevalence (3%) based on a nationally representative sample
of young adults [3]. Despite initial contradictory findings
regarding the association between M. genitalium and female
genital tract pathology [6, 7], several studies have since
confirmed this association [1, 3, 8], which has recently
been reviewed in a meta-analysis [9]. The development of
nucleic acid amplification in the 1990s has facilitated several
epidemiologic studies that have examined the association
of M. genitalium with PID [1, 10, 11]. In the 2015 sexually
transmitted infection (STI) treatment guidelines, the Centers
for Disease Control (CDC) calls attention to M. genitalium as
an emerging sexually transmitted pathogen in women [12].
PID is a polymicrobial disease commonly diagnosed
in women of reproductive age [13]. The prevalence among
women aged 15–44 in the United States declined since 1995
from ∼8.6% down to ∼5.7% in 2002 and leveled off between
2006 and 2010 at 5% [14]. Although a third to half of PID
cases have been associated with N. gonorrhoeae and/or C.
trachomatis, many cases have an unknown etiology [12]. It
is well known that PID can lead to serious reproductive

problems including infertility, chronic pelvic pain, ectopic
pregnancy, and recurrent infections. The independent asso-
ciation between M. genitalium and PID confirmed by several
studies [15] raises concern that M. genitalium may play a
pathogenic role, particularly in cases where other STIs are not
identified. Thus, there is a need for PID treatment regimens
to cover M. genitalium. Further complicating management,
several studies have now identified M. genitalium treatment
resistance among infected women [15–18].
Most studies on M. genitalium are observational studies
of variable sample sizes, some very small, with very few
randomized trials. Consequently, some of the study findings
may not be transferable to most populations. The prevalence
of M. genitalium from cohort studies done in high-risk
populations is considerably higher than the prevalence found
in the general population [1, 2]. M. genitalium has also been
described in sexually abstinent women, putting into question
the criteria for screening for this pathogen.
Our objective is to review the evidence in the literature
regarding the association of M. genitalium with genital
tract pathology in women and to identify needed areas of
research regarding the pathophysiology, clinical manifesta-
tions, screening, and treatment of this pathogen.
2. Materials and Methods
An initial PubMed search was conducted using the terms
“Mycoplasma genitalium,” “Mycoplasma genitalium women,”
and “prevalence of Mycoplasma genitalium in asymp-
tomatic women,” which identified 1064 articles. Articles
were excluded for lack of relevance by reviewing titles,
abstracts, and content. English articles presenting relevant
data stratified by sex and conducted exclusively in women
were included. As a result, 66 articles were included in this
review.
3. Results and Discussion
3.1. Clinical Updates on M. genitalium as a Sexually
Transmitted Infection in Women
3.1.1. Epidemiology. M. genitalium is one of the most common
microorganisms associated with genital tract infections and
is increasingly recognized as a STI [1, 19–21]. M. genitalium
infection has several clinical features consistent with sexual
transmission, including higher detection among sexually
active individuals compared to sexually na¨
ıve adolescents,
detection in partners of infected individuals, and predomi-
nance in younger individuals with multiple sexual partners
and men who have sex with men (particularly those infected
with HIV) [1, 3, 8, 19, 22, 23]. Several studies that had
identified Mycoplasma as a STI have showed statistically
significant increased rates of infection among sexually active
women, with rate/risk of infection increasing with 2 or more
sexual partners. One study reported that the prevalence of
M. genitalium increases by 10% with each additional sexual
partner [3]. It has also been shown that women with infected
partners are also at increased risk [3] so sexual activity in
itself appears to be a major risk factor but is not the only
determinant factor for infection. Further, several studies have
shown an independent association between M. genitalium
and genital infection. It however appears that not all carriers
are symptomatic as evidenced by general population studies
[24].
Several clinical associations with M. genitalium infection
have been identified. In one prospective study, M. genitalium
was found most frequently among women aged ≤24 years,
those with a history of abortion, and those with first inter-
course after 20 years [35]. This last association seems coun-
terintuitive but may be related to a higher chance of clearing
the infection when women are first exposed to the organism
at a younger age, although there are no studies to date to
support this argument. Overall, most evidence suggests a low
prevalence of M. genitalium among asymptomatic women
[25], which may make screening efforts low-yield [21, 25, 28,
35, 36].
Most of the epidemiological studies on Mycoplasma
infection have been conducted in high-risk populations,
such as symptomatic and asymptomatic patients attending
STI clinics. This introduces a sampling bias and limits the
conclusions regarding M. genitalium as an independent STI
in the general population [25, 36].
Table 1 summarizes the studies regarding the prevalence
of M. genitalium. The prevalence in the general population
is not known since routine screening is not done but some
studies have estimated the global prevalence of M. genital-
ium among women to range between 1 and 6.4% [37–39].
Prevalence studies have usually included women attending
STI clinics or those infected with HIV. Clarivet et al. found
a low rate of 0.1% in asymptomatic women [25] whereas
Gaydos et al. found a rate close to 20% among women
attending STI clinic in Baltimore (∼70% of these women
were symptomatic) [2]. Studies from adolescent clinics, STI
clinics, and emergency departments in the United States have
identified M. genitalium as a genital tract microorganism in
15–20% of young women reporting genitourinary symptoms
or at risk for STIs based on clinical history [13].
M. genitalium coinfection with C. trachomatis has also
been recognized. In a cross-sectional case-control study,
4.5% of asymptomatic patients were found to be positive
for M. genitalium [27], and ∼5% of individuals infected
with C. trachomatis were coinfected with M. genitalium [27].
Asymptomatic study participants, usually recruited from a
convenience group of STI clinic attendees reported no genital
tract symptoms [21]. The prevalence was higher among
younger women 18–24 years of age compared to older women
(7.9% for C. trachomatis and 2.4% for M. genitalium, resp.)
[35].
3.1.2. Clinical Manifestations. M. genitalium has been asso-
ciated with typical PID symptoms such as pelvic pain,
abnormal vaginal discharge, fever, nausea, and vomiting.
Symptomatic women who are positive for M. genitalium are
more likely to report postcoital bleeding, which could be due
to cervicitis, compared to women negative for the organism
(AOR 5.8; 95% CI 1.4–23.3, after adjusting for age and coinfec-
tions) [36]. Most M. genitalium infections are asymptomatic

in women [24] and roughly half of women (56.2%) who
test positive for the organism are asymptomatic [37]. Like C.
trachomatis, M. genitalium can lead to “silent” PID infections
with mild symptoms relative to N. gonorrhoeae associated
PID symptoms [13]. Bjartling et al. found comparable rates of
abnormal vaginal wet smear, cervical friability or tenderness,
fever, and level of serum C-reactive protein (CRP) between
M. genitalium-positive women and negative controls [27].
However, M. genitalium-positive women were more likely to
report postcoital bleeding than the negative controls [AOR
2.00 (1.10–3.61)]. Further, women with M. genitalium were
more likely to have combined cervical tenderness, postcoital
bleeding, and abnormal vaginal discharge [AOR 2.71 (1.50–
4.90)] compared to women not infected with M. genitalium
[27].
3.1.3. M. genitalium: An Emerging Cause of Pelvic Inflamma-
tory Disease (PID). PID is an inflammatory disease that can
include one or more of the following conditions: endometri-
tis, salpingitis, tuboovarian abscess, and pelvic peritonitis.
PID is described as a polymicrobial syndrome, mainly caused
by anaerobic bacterial species [1]. N. gonorrhoeae and C.
trachomatis are the most commonly diagnosed organisms
in PID, yet up to 70% of cases are of indeterminate
etiology [1, 40]. Organisms of the vaginal flora such as
Mycoplasma, Ureaplasma, Gardnerella vaginalis, Escherichia
coli, and anaerobes have also been associated with PID. With
the development of nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs),
the incidence of biopsy-proven endometritis or clinical PID
associated with M. genitalium has increased [1, 27]. Women
positive for M. genitalium were found to be twice as likely
to have histology-proven endometritis than women testing
negative after adjusting for age, race, N. gonorrhoeae, and C.
trachomatis [AOR 2.0 (1.0 to 4.2)] [15, 41]. Despite being less
studied, postabortal PID has been shown to be strongly asso-
ciated with M. genitalium [AOR 6.3 (1.6–25.3)] [1, 13]. Several
 4
Infectious Diseases in Obstetrics and Gynecology
cross-sectional studies have investigated the independent
association between M. genitalium and PID. For example, one
prospective study reported a thirteenfold increased incidence
of endometritis in the presence of M. genitalium at 30-day
follow-up visits among an urban population of women in
the United States with clinical PID without concurrent N.
gonorrhoeae and C. trachomatis infection [15]. A recent meta-
analysis shows pooled odds ratios of 1.66 [95% CI, 1.35–2.04]
for cervicitis and 2.43 for infertility [95% CI, .93–6.34] among
M. genitalium infected women [9].
3.1.4. Mycoplasma genitalium and Its Association with Other
STIs and Malignancies. M. genitalium has been associated
with increased susceptibility to HIV infection [42, 43]. Unlike
most other Mycoplasma species, M. genitalium can attach
to the surface of epithelial cells and invade the cells with a
specialized tip structure [4]. In an in vitro model, Das et al.
showed that M. genitalium increased the risk of HIV infection
by infecting the epithelial layer, reducing its integrity, and
activating HIV cell targets beyond the epithelial layer, thereby
promoting transmission and reproduction within the host
and increasing viral shedding through mucosal surfaces [42].
Vandepitte et al. in their nested case-control study found
evidence of a temporal relationship between M. genitalium
and HIV acquisition [43]. The association was only found
among the subgroup that was tested for M. genitalium
three months prior to first HIV-positive results compared
to the group with earlier HIV testing (aOR = 7.19; 95% CI
1.68 to 30.77) [43]. Further studies have shown a positive
association between M. genitalium and high-risk human
papilloma virus (HR-HPV) infection. For example, one study
of female sex workers showed that 39.6% were positive for M.
genitalium and HR-HPV [29]. In addition, Zarei et al. have
demonstrated an association between chronic M. genitalium
infection and ovarian cancer and lymphoma [44]. However,
these studies did not control for the sexual behavior of
women and their partners, limiting the generalizability of the
results.
3.1.5. Mycoplasma in Pregnancy. All Mycoplasma species have
been associated with perinatal morbidity and mortality [45].
A US-based cohort study demonstrated a 2.5-fold increase in
preterm birth in women with M. genitalium infection who
presented with contractions between 23 and 32 weeks of
gestation compared to noninfected women (AOR 2.5; 95% CI
1.2–6.0) [1]. In a meta-analysis of six studies, M. genitalium
was associated with preterm birth with a pooled OR of 1.89
(95% CI, 1.25–2.85) and also associated with spontaneous
abortion with a pooled OR of 1.82 (95% CI, 1.10–3.03)
[9].
Of the Mycoplasmas, M. hominis and Ureaplasma have
been most associated with chorioamnionitis and are thought
to contribute to these adverse effects [45]. While M. hominis
has not been associated with PID, it has been associated
with upper respiratory infections, nervous system infections,
neonatal bacteremia, and meningoencephalitis, unlike M.
genitalium [46].
3.1.6. Diagnosis and Screening
Mycoplasma Diagnosis. M. genitalium is a small bacterium of
the Mollicutes class with no cell wall and a genome of only 580
kilobases in size [1, 47]. Consequently, it cannot be detected
by gram stain and is extremely difficult to culture requiring
up to 6 months for growth [12]. Its genome is most similar to
Mycoplasma pneumonia [48], which causes atypical bacterial
pneumonia. Currently there is no FDA-approved diagnostic
test for M. genitalium [1]. Given the difficulty with culturing
the organism and the lack of standardized serological tests
for M. genitalium, NAATs in the form of polymerase chain
reaction (PCR) assays are almost exclusively carried out for
the diagnosis of M. genitalium in the research setting. Some
PCR assays have demonstrated >95% specificity and sensitiv-
ity [49]. A recent study reported loop-mediated isothermal
amplification (LAMP) as a novel NAAT, which has similar
sensitivity to a PCR assay [50].
To date four types of specimens can be collected for the
detection of M. genitalium: vaginal swab, first void urine,
and endocervical and rectal swabs. Some studies in the
United States have shown that NAATs with vaginal swab
specimens have the highest relative sensitivity compared to
urine and endocervical specimens [10, 51]. Further, self-
obtained vaginal swabs have been found to yield similar
test sensitivities to clinician-obtained specimens [10]. In an
earlier study conducted in Seattle, WA, among symptomatic
women attending a STI clinic, the specimen with the highest
sensitivities was the vaginal specimen PCR: reported sensi-
tivities were 91%, 53%, and 65% for vaginal, cervical, and
urine specimens, respectively [51]. In a subsequent cross-
sectional study among women attending a STI clinic in New
Orleans, the relative sensitivity of PCR was 85.7% for the
vaginal swab specimen, 74.3% for the endocervical swab
specimen, 61.4% for the urine specimen, and 24.3% for the
rectal swab specimen for the detection of M. genitalium in
women [10]. Consequently, vaginal swabs are currently the
most commonly used specimens for detecting M. genitalium
through PCR.
To Screen or Not to Screen. The 2015 CDC sexually transmitted
disease treatment guidelines recommend that all women
diagnosed with PID should also be tested for HIV, gonorrhea,
and chlamydia [12]. There are no recommendations regarding
M. genitalium screening given the lack of data around the
utility of screening and the lack of a FDA-approved testing
modality for commercial use [12].
Given the higher prevalence of M. genitalium in high-risk
women [1] and its reported association with PID, infertility,
and adverse pregnancy outcomes, it would be reasonable
to test symptomatic women for M. genitalium if NAAT is
available. Further, in patients whose symptoms are refractory
to appropriate antibiotic therapy for PID, cervicitis, and
endometritis, testing for M. genitalium may be clinically
beneficial and indicated based on current data.
There is ongoing debate regarding possible cost, benefits,
and harm of universal screening for M. genitalium among
asymptomatic patients given that most carriers are likely
asymptomatic. Given limited data, this decision should be
 Infectious Diseases in Obstetrics and Gynecology
5
based on a discussion between providers and patients in
the context of personal risk factors, as official screening
recommendations will not be made until better quality data
on cost, harm, and benefits are available.
3.2. Treating M. genitalium Infection. Azithromycin and
doxycycline are the current first-line treatment for cervicitis
and NGU [5]. One of the initial randomized controlled trials
on Mycoplasma genitalium treatment reported more effective
treatment with a single 1 g of azithromycin compared to
doxycycline 100 mg BID for 7 days in the USA [52]. Cure
rates with azithromycin ranged from 67 to 87% [5]. However,
higher treatment failures with single 1 g of azithromycin were
reported with a decline in efficacy down to 60% [53, 54] and
to 39% in the most recent study [55]. Treatment failure with
azithromycin is due to an isolated point mutation on 23 rRNA
gene in numerous M. genitalium populations [17], with up to
50% of cases reported [12].
Due to these poor efficacy rates, alternative azithromycin
regimens have been investigated [5]. Several studies have
examined an extended 1.5 g azithromycin (500 mg on day
1, followed by 250 mg daily for 4 days) and a single higher
dose of 2 g azithromycin once with the rationale that an
extended azithromycin-containing regimen decreases the
risk of acquired macrolide resistance when initiated first-
line among patients without preexisting macrolide resistance.
A similar trend has also been noted with doxycycline [52].
Unfortunately, a recent randomized controlled trial found
declining microbiological cure rate for the extended regimen
and single 2 g regimen to 25–81% (wide range based on
different studies) and 73%, respectively [5].
In light of the rising azithromycin resistance, moxi-
floxacin had been introduced as a second-line treatment
option. Moxifloxacin, a fluoroquinolone, was thought to be
a reliable alternative with a reported 100% cure rate initially
[30, 56]. According to the 2015 CDC guidelines, women
with PID who do not respond to the first-line treatment
within 7–10 days should be considered as possibly infected
with M. genitalium and treated with moxifloxacin 400 mg/day
for 14 days [12, 57]. It is not used as first-line due to
more significant adverse effects associated with moxifloxacin
relative to azithromycin, such as tendon rupture, although
these significant adverse effects remain rare. However, as
of 2013, increasing treatment failures have also been noted
due to bacterial resistance to moxifloxacin with failure rates
ranging between 10% and 15% [17, 18, 58]. Given increasing
moxifloxacin resistance, monotherapy has the potential to
increase the risk of multidrug-resistant strains.
Other fluoroquinolones that have been investigated
and
proven
to
remain
effective
include
gatifloxacin
and sitafloxacin [59]. Other fluoroquinolones such as
gemifloxacin, sparfloxacin, grepafloxacin, trovafloxacin, and
garenoxacin have been shown to be effective against
M. genitalium in vitro but lack human studies [59].
Ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, and levofloxacin reportedly have
poor activity against the microbe relative to moxifloxacin
[59]. Pristinamycin is a streptogramin that is used to treat
vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium bacteremia and
complicated skin infections due to MRSA [60]. Treatment
of M. genitalium with pristinamycin (1 g 6 hourly for 10
days) led to negative PCR results 28 days after treatment
[60]. This regimen appears promising for the treatment of
multidrug-resistant M. genitalium but has not been well
studied to inform optimal dosing and is reportedly expensive
with limited availability [60].
Given the organism’s propensity for drug resistance,
follow-up testing to document treatment response is reason-
able. Some authors advocate for a test of cure (TOC) in 3-4
weeks after treatment with resistance profiling in those with
persistent infection despite treatment [16]. Most studies on
TOC have been conducted in men, with fewer studies done
in women. A retrospective cohort study performed TOC at
1 month from the initiation of therapy with azithromycin-
containing regimens to identify resistant infections [61].
However, a later prospective cohort study investigated the
optimal time for TOC and reported negative TOC within an
average of 14 days (12–15 days) for infected patients that were
susceptible to a single 1 g of azithromycin, which was used
as the first-line treatment [55]. Those that appeared resistant
were further treated with moxifloxacin 400 mg daily for 10
days with a negative TOC at 28 days for responders [55].
Furthermore, Falk et al. showed that individuals treated with
azithromycin had a negative PCR within 8 days and those
treated with moxifloxacin had a negative PCR within 1 week
[62]. However, it was further discussed that early negative
PCR may be related to low DNA levels for detection soon
after treatment initiation with resistance detected at 10 days
after treatment initiation with azithromycin and eventually
recolonization requiring further treatment [62]. Hence it was
concluded that optimal timing for the most reliable TOC
should take place 3-4 weeks after treatment [62], which
correlates with an earlier Japanese study performed among
men [63].
Testing and/or empirical treatment of partners within
the preceding 60 days of diagnosis are also strongly recom-
mended for women with confirmed positive M. genitalium
to prevent reinfection [12]. Partners are recommended to
abstain from sexual intercourse until adequate treatment is
completed and symptoms resolve if initially present [12].
There is no specific evidence regarding the utility of condom
use in these circumstances.
3.3. Long-Term Sequelae of M. genitalium Infection. The long-
term reproductive consequences of M. genitalium infection
have not been clearly determined. However, the association
with PID indicates that infertility, chronic pelvic pain, and
risk of ectopic pregnancy may be potential sequelae of
infection with this pathogen like for C. trachomatis and N.
gonorrhoeae infection [64]. This may be another argument
for screening in certain populations. Table 2 summarizes the
studies that investigated the association between M. genital-
ium and infertility. M. genitalium can persist for months or
years in infected individuals [65]. In a recent meta-analysis,
it had been reported that women carrying M. genitalium
infection are usually asymptomatic with reported estimated
clearance rate of 15 months based on a large London study
[24]. Despite spontaneous clearance, chronic infection may
lead to tissue damage prior to clearance causing long-term

state may also lead to reinfection leading to more chronic
infection. The PID Evaluation and Clinical Health (PEACH)
Study is a multicenter, randomized prospective clinical trial,
the largest treatment trial of mild to moderate acute PID in
the United States, involving 586 women in several centers
in North America who presented with signs and symptoms
of PID [41]. This study showed higher rates of infertility
(22%), chronic pelvic pain (42%), and recurrent PID (31%)
among women in whom M. genitalium had been detected
on endometrial samples by PCR compared to women testing
negative, but these findings were not statistically significant
[15, 41]. It is unclear whether the increased risk of other infec-
tions such as chlamydia or gonorrhea lead to infertility or if
M. genitalium itself primarily leads to infertility. Given that
untreated PID can lead to long-term adverse reproductive
outcomes, M. genitalium may contribute to adverse effects
on the reproductive tract. One prospective study identified
strong M. genitalium antibody responses among women with
a diagnosis of infertility that were asymptomatic, suggesting
an adverse effect of M. genitalium on fertility [33]. Another
prospective study showed that fertile women were less likely
to have PCR-proven M. genitalium infection compared to
women with idiopathic infertility (4.4% versus 29.2%, 𝑃 =
0.0479) [34]. Consequently, some authors would recommend
screening for M. genitalium as part of the STI work-up given
possible adverse effects such as infertility, chronic pelvic
disease, risk of ectopic pregnancy, and preterm labor as well as
any other health consequence associated with PID. However,
evidence regarding other reproductive sequelae is even more
limited, and the few studies that have evaluated reproduc-
tive sequelae have not shown any statistically significant
difference between women with and without M. genitalium
infection [41]. A single case-control study on risk of ectopic
pregnancy did not find any significant association either (OR
1.0, 95% CI 0.5–2.0) [66]. Well-powered prospective studies
that control for other genital tract infections and compare
M. genitalium cases to asymptomatic noninfected women are
needed to establish the long-term reproductive consequences
of chronic M. genitalium infection.
4. Conclusions and Areas for Future Research
M. genitalium is now increasingly recognized as a STI and
has been associated with PID, endometritis, cervicitis, and
HIV in women though clinical manifestations and risk factors
overlap with other STIs. The availability of NAAT for PCR
detection of this organism will allow further investigation
into the effects of M. genitalium infection on long-term
reproductive health outcomes such as infertility, chronic
pelvic pain, ectopic pregnancy, and obstetric outcomes such
as preterm deliveries. Due to antibiotic resistance patterns,
alternatives to azithromycin and moxifloxacin must be inves-
tigated. In the interim, clinicians should consider testing for
and treating M. genitalium on a case-by-case basis, partic-
ularly in women diagnosed with PID or cervicitis without
clinical improvement using standard regimens.
