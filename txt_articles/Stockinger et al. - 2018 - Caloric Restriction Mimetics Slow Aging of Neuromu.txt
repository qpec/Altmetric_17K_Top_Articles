Abstract
Resveratrol and metformin have been shown to mimic some aspects of caloric restriction and exercise. However, it remains unknown if these 
molecules also slow age-related synaptic degeneration, as previously shown for caloric restriction and exercise. In this study, we examined 
the structural integrity of neuromuscular junctions (NMJs) in 2-year-old mice treated with resveratrol and metformin starting at 1 year of 
age. We found that resveratrol significantly slows aging of NMJs in the extensor digitorum longus muscle of 2-year-old mice. Resveratrol also 
preserved the morphology of muscle fibers in old mice. Although metformin slowed the rate of muscle fiber aging, it did not significantly affect 
aging of NMJs. Based on these findings, we sought to determine if resveratrol directly affects NMJs. For this, we examined postsynaptic sites, 
the NMJ region located on the muscle peripheral membrane, on cultured myotubes derived from C2C12 cells. We discovered that resveratrol 
increases the number of postsynaptic sites on myotubes exhibiting a youthful architecture, suggesting that resveratrol directly affects the NMJ. 
Altogether, we provide compelling evidence indicating that resveratrol slows aging of NMJs and muscle fibers.
Keywords: Resveratrol—Metformin—Metabolism—NMJ—Myotube
With increasing age, synapses in the central and peripheral nervous 
system degenerate, compromising neurotransmission, and causing 
cellular atrophy (1–5). These deleterious changes at synapses inevi-
tably lead to cognitive and motor dysfunction (5–8). Much of the 
knowledge regarding the specific cellular changes at aging synapses 
comes from studying the neuromuscular junction (NMJ), the synap-
tic contact made by α-motor neurons and extrafusal muscle fibers 
(9). Unlike synapses in the central nervous system, the NMJ is acces-
sible and large enough to visualize its structural features using light 
microscopy.
It is well documented that the NMJ undergoes a number of del-
eterious structural changes that include fragmentation of the post-
synaptic site and partial or full degeneration of innervating α-motor 
axon nerve endings with increasing age (10). These deleterious 
structural changes at NMJs are followed by muscle atrophy, which 
contributes to the loss of mobility that occurs with increasing age 
(11,12). In recent years, we have learned that a caloric restricted 
(CR) diet and exercise, two anti-aging factors, can attenuate and 
even reverse age-related structural changes at NMJs (10). These 
effects on NMJs have added additional impetus for discovering 
small molecules that mimic the anti-aging effects of caloric restric-
tion and exercise.
A number of small molecules have been shown to mimic the 
effects of caloric restriction and exercise. Among these, resveratrol, 
metformin, rapamycin, and 5-Aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribo-
nucleotide (AICAR) have been shown to provide health benefits and 
attenuate aging of rodents (13–18). In recent years, several studies 
have explored the possibility that these anti-aging small molecules 
slow the decline of cognitive and motor function by preserving the 
structural integrity of synapses. In middle-aged rats treated with res-
veratrol, pyramidal neurons in the prefrontal cortex and hippocam-
pus contain more and longer spines, suggesting that resveratrol 
leads to the formation of new synapses (19). In addition, resveratrol 
has been shown to speed the repair of injured and disease-affected 
synapses (20,21). There is also growing evidence that metformin, 
rapamycin, and AICAR may promote the repair of synapses during

 aging, diseases, and injury (13,22–26). Despite these findings, it 
remains unknown if the aforementioned anti-aging small molecules 
directly or indirectly affect synapses. This is a difficult question to 
address in the central nervous system because of the complexity of 
neural circuits and small size of synapses.
In this study, we examined the effect of resveratrol and met-
formin on NMJs in mice and postsynaptic sites that form on cul-
tured myotubes. We discovered that a resveratrol-rich diet slows the 
accumulation of age-associated structural changes at NMJs in mice. 
Resveratrol also increased the number of postsynaptic sites exhibit-
ing a youthful architecture formed on cultured myotubes. In con-
trast, metformin had no significant effect on aging NMJs in mice, 
and only moderately increased the number of postsynaptic sites with 
a youthful topology on myotubes.
Materials and Methods
Mice
Old (24 months) and young adult (3 months) C57BL/6J wild-type 
mice were bred at the National Institute on Aging. Mice were anes-
thetized using isoflurane and then perfused transcardially with 
10 mL of 0.1 M phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), followed by 25 mL 
of ice-cold 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M PBS (pH 7.4). Only male 
mice were analyzed in this study. All experiments were carried out 
under NIH guidelines and animal protocols approved by the Virginia 
Tech Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.
Dietary Regimens
Mice were fed: (i) standard AIN-93G food pellets ad libitum for their 
entire life; (ii) a CR diet (AIN-93G pellets with 40% less fat calories) 
ad libitum (27) starting at 4 months of age; and (iii) AIN-93G food 
pellets containing resveratrol at 400 mg/kg (16) or AIN-93G food 
pellets containing metformin at 1,000 mg/kg (17) starting at 1 year 
of age. Mice were sacrificed at 2 years of age to examine NMJs and 
muscle fibers.
Immunohistochemistry
NMJs and muscle fibers were stained as previously described (10,28). 
Briefly, whole extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscles were stained 
with an antibody against synaptotagmin-2 (Syt2; DSHB; ZNP-1; 
1:250) to label the terminal of motor axons and with alexa-555-
tagged α-bungarotoxin (fBTX; Thermo Fisher Scientific; B35451; 
1:1,000) to label nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs). To 
visualize muscle fibers, the tibialis anterior (TA) muscle was cut in 
half at the largest diameter and placed in 10 × 10 × 5 mm Tissue-
Tek Cryomolds with Tissue Freezing Medium (Triangle Biomedical 
Science, Inc.) to generate 16 μm cross-sections. Muscle sections were 
then incubated with alexa-488-conjugated wheat germ agglutinin 
(WGA) and DAPI (4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole: Sigma-Aldrich; 
28718-90-3; 1:1,000) diluted in 0.1 M PBS for 2 hours. Following 
incubation, muscles were washed three times with 0.1 M PBS and 
mounted using Vectashield (Vector Laboratories, H-1000).
Analysis of NMJs and Muscle Fibers
Images to analyze NMJs and muscle fibers in mice were acquired 
using a Zeiss LSM 700 confocal microscope. Maximum intensity pro-
jections from confocal z-stacks were created with Zen Black (Zeiss). 
NMJs and muscle fibers were analyzed as previously described (10). 
NMJs were deemed fragmented if they contained more than five AChR 
islands. To determine the innervation status of NMJs, we imaged and 
analyzed the most superficial NMJs in the EDL muscle. These NMJs 
were uniformly labeled with the antibody against Syt2. NMJs were 
deemed denervated if Syt2 was completely missing or only partially 
overlapped (5%–95%) with the postsynaptic region (AChR clusters). 
In all experiments, at least four male mice were examined per age and 
per group. At least 50 NMJs were examined per animal. Muscle fiber 
size was analyzed using ImageJ and represented as μm2.
C2C12 Cultures
C2C12 cells (29) were plated in 8-well chamber slides coated with 
Poly-L-ornithine in sterile water (3 µg/mL; Sigma-Aldrich; P2533) 
and laminin in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM; 
10 µg/mL; Thermo Fisher Scientific; 23017015) at 100,000 cells 
per well. Twenty-four hours post seeding, culture media (high-glu-
cose DMEM, 20% fetal bovine serum, 1× Glutamine, Pen strep, 
Fungizone) was replaced with fusion media (high-glucose DMEM, 
10% horse serum, 1× Glutamine, Pen strep, Fungizone). Cells were 
incubated at 37°C and 5.0% CO2.
Treatment of C2C12-Derived Myotubes
Resveratrol (150 µM) and metformin (1 mM) were diluted in fusion 
media. Fusion media served as the control for each treatment. 
Resveratrol and metformin were added to 6 days old myotubes for 
24 hours.
Induction of Postsynaptic Sites on C2C12-Derived 
Myotubes Using Neural-Agrin
The active region of neural-agrin (30) was purchased from R&D 
Systems (550-AG). Neural-agrin (0.031 ng/µL) was added 3 days 
post-fusion to induce clustering of AChRs on the peripheral mem-
brane of myotubes. To test the activity of neural-agrin, AChR clus-
ters were visualized and counted using light microscopy.
Staining for AChRs on C2C12-Derived Myotubes
Myotubes were fixed using 4% paraformaldehyde plus 4% sucrose 
diluted in PBS at room temperature for 30 minutes. AChR clusters 
were stained using fBTX (1:500) in PBS for 2 hours at room tem-
perature or overnight at 4°C. The myotubes were then washed three 
times with PBS and mounted using Vectashield mounting medium.
Analysis of AChR Clusters in Myotubes
Images of AChR clusters and myotubes were taken using a laser 
scanning confocal microscope (Zeiss LSM 710) with 40× (1.3 
NA) objective. Four images in the center of every well were 
taken to determine the type and number of AChR clusters, and 
the size of myotubes. Images were then analyzed using FIJI soft-
ware to determine the average number of AChR clusters and 
width per myotube per image. Only AChR clusters (also referred 
as postsynaptic sites) equal to or larger than 4 µm in diameter 
were examined. The following criteria are used to categorize 
postsynaptic sites: (i) plaques are closed AChR clusters; (ii) rings 
refer to circular and perforated AChR clusters; (iii) half-rings are 
AChR clusters resembling a half-moon structure; (iv) matured 
 
sites are composed of two to four AChR clusters; and (v) fragmented 
sites are composed of five or more independent AChR clusters.
Analysis of Myotube Size
To determine myotube size, the diameter was measured at the widest 
region of each myotube and the average diameter size was compared 
between conditions.

Significance between control and treatment groups was determined 
using unpaired t test. The Kolmogorov–Smirnov test was used to 
compare the distribution of muscle fibers’ cross-sectional area (CSA) 
between groups. Data were expressed as the mean ± SE (standard 
error). p < .05 was considered statistically significant.
Results
Resveratrol, But Not Metformin, Mimics the Effects 
of CR on Aging NMJs in Mice
We began this study by asking if resveratrol and metformin affect aging 
of NMJs in male C57BL/6 mice. For this, NMJs were examined in 
2-year-old mice fed food pellets containing resveratrol at 400 mg/kg or 
metformin at 0.1% w/w starting at 1 year of age. We used three differ-
ent cohorts of mice as controls: (i) 2-year-old mice fed a regular diet for 
their entire life; (ii) 2-year-old mice fed a diet containing 40% less calo-
ries, a CR diet, starting at 4 months of age; and (iii) 3-month-old mice 
fed a regular diet. Because CR has been shown to attenuate NMJ aging, 
we used CR as a positive control for the resveratrol and metformin 
treatments. We assessed structural features of NMJs in the EDL muscle 
(Figure 1A–D). To visualize NMJs, the postsynaptic region located on 
the muscle fiber was labeled with fluorescently tagged α-bungarotoxin 
(fBTX), which binds with high affinity to nAChR. Motor nerve endings 
(the presynapse) innervating muscle fibers were stained with an anti-
body against Syt2, a protein associated with synaptic vesicles. Although 
we were able to readily visualize all presynaptic sites in the EDL muscle 
using anti-Syt2, presynaptic sites located within 60 µm of the muscle 
superficial surface were better labeled. We thus only analyzed NMJs 
located within 60 µm of the muscle surface.
We examined NMJs for fragmentation and denervation, two 
cellular features closely associated with aging NMJs in the EDL 
muscle (10). Compared with mice fed a regular diet (Figure 1B, 
E, and F), we found significantly fewer fragmented and dener-
vated NMJs in aged mice fed a resveratrol-rich diet (Figure 1D–F). 
 
There were also significantly fewer degenerating NMJs in old mice 
fed a CR diet (Figure 1C, E, and F), as previously shown (10). In 
Figure 1. A resveratrol-rich diet slows aging of neuromuscular junctions (NMJs). (A–D) 
The architecture of NMJs was examined in the extensor digitorum longus 
(EDL) muscle of young adult mice (3M for 3-month-old) and old mice (24M for 24-month-old) fed a regular (Ctrl), a caloric restricted (CR) diet, resveratrol-rich 
(Resv), or metformin-rich diet (Met and see Supplementary Figure 1 for images of NMJs). Compared with old mice fed a regular diet, fewer fragmented (E) and 
denervated (F) NMJs were found in mice fed a CR diet and a resveratrol-rich diet. A metformin-rich diet did not significantly alter the incidence of fragmented 
and denervated NMJs in old mice (E and F). Four male C57BL/6 mice were examined per age and treatment. At least 50 NMJs were analyzed per mouse. Error 
bar = standard error. **p < .01; ***p < .001 versus old control. Scale bar = 10 µm.

 contrast to resveratrol and CR, metformin had no discernable effect 
on aging NMJs (Figure 1E and F). Thus, resveratrol but not met-
formin (Supplementary Figure 1A and B) prevents the accumulation 
of age-related structural changes at NMJs in aging mice.
Reduced Muscle Fiber Size in Aged Mice Fed 
Resveratrol and on a CR Diet
Because a close relationship exists between the structural integrity of 
NMJs and muscle fibers, we asked if resveratrol also slows aging of 
muscle fibers in the TA muscle. We chose the TA muscle because of 
its similar function and muscle fiber composition to the EDL muscle. 
We examined the size of muscle fibers by staining 16 µm cross-sec-
tions of the TA muscle with fluorescently tagged wheat germ agglu-
tinin (WGA) (Figure 2A and B). Surprisingly, the mean muscle fiber 
CSA was similar between young adult and aged mice (Figure 2C). 
We also found no statistical differences in the mean muscle fiber 
CSA between mice fed resveratrol or metformin and old control mice 
(Figure 2C). However, muscle fibers were significantly smaller in old 
CR mice compared with old control mice (Figure 2A–C).
With increasing age, the size of muscle fibers becomes more 
heterogeneous within a given muscle (31). We therefore asked if 
the different dietary interventions affect the distribution of muscle 
fiber size in the TA muscle. For this, we generated a frequency his-
togram to visually inspect and compare the distribution of muscle 
fibers CSA across different treatments. This analysis revealed that 
the majority of muscle fibers were smaller in the TA muscle of old 
mice maintained in a CR and resveratrol diet compared with old 
control mice (Figure 3A). Both interventions reduced the number of 
large muscle fibers (1,750 µm2 or larger), and increased the number 
of medium size fibers (500–1,250 µm2), compared with young adult 
and old control mice (Figure 3A). To quantitatively compare the dis-
tribution of muscle fibers CSA between treatments, we performed a 
Kolmogorov–Smirnov test. Compared to old control mice, there are 
more muscle fibers with a smaller CSA in young adult and old mice 
fed a metformin, resveratrol, or CR diet (Figure 3B). Additionally, 
these data show that the distribution of muscle fibers CSA is simi-
lar between young adult and metformin-treated old mice (Figure 
3A and B). This analysis also revealed that muscle fibers are signifi-
cantly smaller in old mice fed a resveratrol-rich diet and a CR diet 
compared to muscle fibers in all other mice examined in this study 
(Figure 3A and B). These findings demonstrate that resveratrol, met-
formin, and a CR diet prevent the hypertrophy of muscle fibers that 
naturally occurs with increasing age.
Postsynaptic Sites in Cultured Myotubes Retain 
Their 
Youthful 
Topology in the Presence of 
Resveratrol
Since resveratrol was systemically administered, it is possible that 
NMJs are protected from aging by changes that occur elsewhere. To 
determine if resveratrol directly affects NMJs, we examined postsyn-
aptic sites in myotubes (32) treated with resveratrol. The location 
and topology of postsynaptic sites were revealed by AChR clusters, 
which can be readily visualized using fBTX, located on the periph-
eral membrane of myotubes (Figure 4A and B). With increasing days 
in culture, AChR clusters, and thus postsynaptic sites, undergo a 
number of structural changes (Figure 4D) that appear as a: (i) small 
plaque; (ii) ring-like structure; (iii) half-ring-shaped structure; (iv) 
aggregation of two to four individual AChR clusters (herein referred 
to as matured clusters); and (v) aggregation of four or more individ-
ual AChR clusters (herein referred to as fragmented).
To determine the effect of resveratrol on AChR clusters, 
myotubes cultured for 7 days were treated with resveratrol 
for 24 hours. Resveratrol slowed the maturation but not the

fluorescently tagged wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) (A and B). The cross-
sectional area (CSA) was determined in muscle fibers from the tibialis 
anterior (TA) muscles of young adult mice (3M for 3-month-old) and old mice 
(24M for 24-month-old) fed a regular (Ctrl), a CR diet, resveratrol-rich (Resv), 
or metformin-rich (Met) diet (C). Error bar = standard error. *p < .05. Scale

 number of AChR clusters (Figure 4C and E) present on myotubes. 
 
Resveratrol-treated myotubes contained more AChR clusters exhib-
iting a plaque-like topology. Concomitantly, myotubes treated with 
resveratrol had fewer ring, half-ring, and matured AChR clusters. 
These findings suggest that resveratrol directly affects the NMJ.
In vivo, motor axons secrete agrin isoforms (neural-agrin) to 
stabilize postsynaptic sites (30,33). Through this function, neural-
agrin increases the number of AChR clusters on cultured myotubes 
(Figure 5A–C). To determine if resveratrol synergizes with neural-
agrin to maintain the structural integrity of NMJs, we examined the 
number of postsynaptic sites on myotubes treated with recombi-
nant neural-agrin and resveratrol. We found that resveratrol failed 
to increase the number of postsynaptic sites formed by neural-agrin 
(Figure 5D). Because neural-agrin-derived postsynaptic clusters are 
small and maintain their plaque-shaped structure, we were unable 
to assess morphological changes caused by resveratrol treatments 
on neural-agrin-derived postsynaptic sites. Nevertheless, these find-
ings suggest that resveratrol does not affect the number of NMJs 
but rather acts to influence the architecture of preexisting NMJs.
Resveratrol Increases the Size of Cultured Myotubes
In mice, resveratrol altered the morphology of muscle fibers in add-
ition to the NMJ. We thus assessed the effect of resveratrol on the 
size of myotubes. We measured the width of 6 days old myotubes 
treated with resveratrol for the last 3 days in culture (Figure 6A). We 
found that resveratrol increased the size of myotubes in the absence 
and presence of neural-agrin (Figure 6B and C). These findings are 
in stark contrast to the effect of resveratrol on aging myofibers 
in vivo (Figures 2C, 3A and B). However, it is worth noting that 
myotubes fail to fully mature in culture unlike myofibers in fully 
developed mice. Thus, resveratrol may simply accelerate the devel-
opment, and thus growth, of myotubes. Importantly, these cultured 
experiments revealed that the growth of myotubes and maturation 
of AChR clusters become dissociated in the presence of resveratrol. 
Thus, resveratrol may recruit distinct molecular mechanisms to 
affect the size of muscle fibers and topology of the postsynaptic 
region of the NMJ.
Impact of Metformin on the 
Topology of Postsynaptic 
Sites and Size of Myotubes
Finally, we examined the impact of metformin on cultured myotubes. 
We assessed the topology of AChR clusters, postsynaptic sites, and 
width of 7 days old myotubes treated with metformin for the last 24 
hours in culture. We found that metformin moderately decreased the 
total number of AChR clusters (Figure 7A), indicating that it met-
formin may halt the formation of new postsynaptic sites. Despite this 
effect, metformin increased the number of plaque-shaped postsynap-
tic AChR clusters compared with untreated myotubes (Figure 7B). 
Metformin also increased the number of ring-shaped postsynaptic 
AChR clusters (Figure 7B). Thus, metformin may also promote, 
albeit more moderately compared with resveratrol, the formation of 
youthful postsynaptic sites on myotubes.
We then asked if metformin affects the size of myotubes. In stark 
contrast to resveratrol (Figure 6), metformin had no effect on the size 
of myotubes (Figure 7C). Although these findings suggest that resvera-
trol and metformin differ in their effects on myotubes and postsynaptic 
sites, it is worth noting that older myotubes were used and treated for 
a shorter period of time with metformin. Thus, metformin may have a 
similar effect as resveratrol if added to myotubes earlier and for longer. 
The additional time in culture also likely explains the increased frag-
mentation of AChR clusters in the metformin experiment (Figure 7B) 
compared with the resveratrol experiment (Figure 4E).

in the presence of resveratrol. C2C12-derived myotubes form postsynaptic-

sites were labeled with fluorescently tagged α-bungarotoxin (fBTX) to 
detect nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs). Myotubes were treated

 Discussion
The goal of this study was to determine the impact of two meta-
bolic modulators and anti-aging small molecules, resveratrol and 
metformin, on synapses. Although these small molecules have been 
shown to slow the erosion of motor and cognitive function during 
aging (16,17,26,34), it remained unknown whether they directly 
affect synapses. We show that resveratrol slows aging of NMJs, the 
synapse formed between motor neurons and muscle fibers, in the 
EDL muscle. We also demonstrate that resveratrol induces the for-
mation of postsynaptic sites exhibiting a “youthful” architecture in 
C2C12-derived myotubes. These findings suggest that resveratrol 
preserves motor function in part by protecting NMJs and muscle fib-
ers. However, it is possible that resveratrol affects other cells that dir-
ectly or indirectly impinge on the health of muscle fibers and NMJs, 
including motor neurons, Schwann cells, and satellite cells. These 
cells were not examined in this study.
Despite the protective effects of resveratrol on aging NMJs, we 
found it to be less effective compared with a CR diet in preventing age-
related changes at NMJs. However, mice were fed a 40% CR diet start-
ing at 4 months of age, whereas resveratrol was introduced into the diet 
of 12-month-old mice. Thus, it is possible that introducing resveratrol 
earlier in life could be more efficacious at preserving the structural integ-
rity of NMJs during aging. Unlike resveratrol, metformin did not slow 
age-related changes at NMJs. This finding is surprising given the bene-
fits metformin has on mobility, health, and life span (17,39,43). Because 
we only tested one concentration of metformin, as well as resveratrol, it 
is possible that a different dose of metformin may slow aging of NMJs 
in mice. Supporting this possibility, we found that metformin applied 
directly to C2C12-derived myotubes induces the formation of post-
synaptic sites with a “youthful” architecture. Future experiments may 
prove that the concentration of metformin used to treat myotubes in 
culture, and possibly other concentrations, slow aging of NMJs in vivo.
In addition, we show that resveratrol, metformin, and CR 
affect aging of muscle fibers in the TA muscle. In old mice fed a 
resveratrol-rich and a CR diet, there were fewer muscle fibers with 
a CSA of 1,750 µm2 or larger. Instead, the number of medium size 
muscle fibers (500–1,250 µm2) increased in aged mice. Metformin 
also increased the number of muscle fibers with a smaller CSA even 
though it did not affect the average mean CSA, similar to resveratrol. 
The shift in the distribution of muscle fiber size in animals treated 
with resveratrol and metformin indicates that some muscle fibers 
may be more responsive to these treatments. The TA muscle is com-
posed primarily of fast fatigue-resistant (FFR) and fast fatigable (FF) 
muscle fibers. Because FF muscle fibers are larger and preferentially

agrin had no effect on the size of myotubes. Resveratrol increased the size 
of myotubes in the absence and presence of neural-agrin (B and C). At least 
three biological replicates were examined per treatment. Error bar = standard 
error. *p < .05.

. Postsynaptic sites on C2C12 myotubes treated with metformin at 
day 6 were examined at day 7
. (A) Metformin did not affect the number of 
acetylcholine receptor (AChR) clusters in C2C12 myotubes. (B) Metformin 
promoted the accumulation of immature clusters (plaques and rings). At least 
three biological replicates were examined per treatment. (C) Despite the effect 
on AChR clusters, metformin did not affect the size of myotubes. At least three 
different biological replicates were examined, and 20 myotubes per biological 
replicate. Error bar = standard error. *p < .05.

 affected during aging (35), we hypothesize FF muscle fibers are more 
responsive to resveratrol, metformin, and a CR diet.
Interestingly, we found that CR significantly decreases the mean 
muscle fiber CSA in the TA muscle of 24-month-old mice. How can 
this finding be reconciled with prior studies showing that muscle 
mass is higher in old animals fed a CR diet compared with old 
control animals (36–38)? First, it is known that a CR diet prevents 
muscle fibers from atrophying in very old animals (38). Thus, the 
higher number of muscle fibers likely accounts for the increased 
muscle mass in aged animals fed a CR diet rather than the size of 
individual fibers. This question could be fully answered in future 
experiments by counting the total number of muscle fibers in the 
TA muscle of mice fed a regular and a CR diet, in addition to deter-
mining the ratio of all the muscle fiber CSA to the TA muscle CSA.
The data presented in this paper indicate that resveratrol and 
metformin recruit signaling modules to maintain the structure of the 
NMJ as well as muscle fibers. The sirtuin and mTOR (The mechanistic 
target of rapamycin) pathways are prominent mechanistic candidates 
because they are present in skeletal muscles and known to be activated 
by resveratrol and metformin (34,39–44). It is also important to note 
that CR modulates these pathways (45). Thus, each small molecule 
and CR may affect aging of the NMJ by preferentially affecting spe-
cific branches of the sirtuin and mTOR pathways within skeletal mus-
cles or specifically located at the pre- and postsynaptic regions of the 
NMJ. Alternatively, these interventions may recruit other molecular 
mechanisms that act directly on the NMJ. Supporting this possibility, 
we found that resveratrol slows the maturation of AChR clusters but 
increases the size of cultured myotubes. This finding is opposite of 
the normal developmental pattern observed in control myotubes and 
myofibers in vivo. In control myotubes and myofibers, there is a tight 
correlation between changes in the topology and size of AChR clus-
ters and the size of myotubes or myofibers. The dissociation between 
changes in AChR clusters and size of myotubes suggest that resveratrol 
recruits molecular mechanisms that act both globally in muscle fibers 
and specifically on the postsynaptic region of the NMJ. The identifi-
cation of such molecular pathways could lead to new approaches for 
preserving the NMJ and muscle fibers during aging.
