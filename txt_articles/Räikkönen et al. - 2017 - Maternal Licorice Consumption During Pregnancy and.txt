Earlier puberty, especially in girls, is associated with physical and mental disorders. Prenatal glucocorticoid expo-
sure influences the timing of puberty in animal models, but the human relevance of those findings is unknown. We
studied whether voluntary consumption of licorice, which contains glycyrrhizin (a potent inhibitor of placental 11β-
hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2, the “barrier” to maternal glucocorticoids), by pregnant women was associated
with pubertal maturation (height, weight, body mass index for age, difference between current and expected adult
height, Tanner staging, score on the Pubertal Development Scale), neuroendocrine function (diurnal salivary cortisol,
dexamethasone suppression), cognition (neuropsychological tests), and psychiatric problems (as measured by the
Child Behavior Checklist) in their offspring. The children were born in 1998 in Helsinki, Finland, and examined during
2009–2011 (mean age = 12.5 (standard deviation (SD), 0.4) years; n = 378). Girls exposed to high maternal glycyr-
rhizin consumption (≥500 mg/week) were taller (mean difference (MD) = 0.4 SD, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.1,
0.8), were heavier (MD = 0.6 SD, 95% CI: 0.2, 1.9), and had higher body mass index for age (MD = 0.6 SD, 95% CI:
0.2, 0.9). They were also 0.5 standard deviations (95% CI: 0.2, 0.8) closer to adult height and reported more
advanced pubertal development (P < 0.04). Girls and boys exposed to high maternal glycyrrhizin consumption
scored 7 (95% CI: 3.1, 11.2) points lower on tests of intelligence quotient, had poorer memory (P < 0.04), and had
3.3-fold (95% CI: 1.4, 7.7) higher odds of attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder problems compared with children
whose mothers consumed little to no glycyrrhizin (≤249 mg/week). No differences in cortisol levels were found.
Licorice consumption during pregnancy may be associated with harm for the developing offspring.

Earlier puberty, especially in girls, is associated with physi-
cal and mental disorders, including hormone-sensitive cancers,
cardiometabolic disorders, and depression (1–3). According
to the “developmental origins hypothesis” of health and dis-
ease, prenatal exposure to environmental adversity “pro-
grams” long-lasting structural and functional changes in key
organs and homeostatic systems, including the brain and its
control of behaviors and reproductive function (4, 5).
Overexposure of the fetus to maternal glucocorticoids is prob-
ably a key mechanism underlying these “programming” events.
While maternal and fetal cortisol levels are correlated (6), fetal

 levels are up to 10 times lower. This gradient is due to the pla-
cental “barrier” enzyme 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase
type 2 (11β-HSD2) (7–9). This enzyme catalyzes metabolism
of 80%–90% of active cortisol in the maternal bloodstream to
inactive cortisone during passage to the fetal circulation (8, 9).
Animal
models of
fetal
glucocorticoid overexposure
include genetic lack of fetoplacental 11β-HSD2, its inhibition
by glycyrrhizin (glycyrrhetinic acid and glycyrrhizic acid—
natural constituents of licorice) or by the synthetic analog
carbenoxolone, maternal stress, maternal high- or low-protein
diet, or bypass with poor-substrate glucocorticoids such as
dexamethasone or betamethasone (7–13). In these models the
offspring have alterations in timing of puberty, reproductive
function, and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis
function as well as having cardiometabolic risk factors, atten-
uated learning and memory, and increased anxiety- and
depression-like behaviors (7–13).
Animal and human placentation and gestation, however, dif-
fer, as does the ontogeny of 11β-HSD2 in the placenta (14),
precluding predictions applicable to humans. Using a dual-
circuit immediate ex vivo perfusion in fresh, intact, term human
placentas, we demonstrated that very low doses (10−8 M) of
glycyrrhetinic acid, coperfused in the maternal circulation with
cortisol, resulted in near complete inhibition of placental
cortisone production and free passage of cortisol to the fetal
circulation (9). Because glycyrrhizin also inhibits maternal
11β-HSD2, it increases cortisol access to renal mineralocorti-
coid receptors, sometimes causing maternal hypertension.
Although other actions of glycyrrhizin include inhibition of
15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase, this probably does
not occur systemically with licorice consumption in vivo (15).
We have studied the offspring of pregnant women from
a unique longitudinal cohort of Finnish mothers and chil-
dren, in which nearly 50% of mothers reported licorice con-
sumption during pregnancy (16–18). At the age of 8 years,
children of women who consumed high amounts of licorice
during pregnancy, when compared with children of women
who consumed low amounts of licorice or none, scored lower
on tests measuring intelligence and memory (17), had an
increased risk of externalizing behavior problems (17), and
had higher HPA-axis activity upon awakening and during
psychosocial stress (18). We examined these children in ado-
lescence to explore associations with pubertal maturation and
to learn whether the cognitive, behavioral, and neuroendo-
crine changes persist.
METHODS
Study design and participants
The participants were from an urban community-based
cohort of 1,049 women and their healthy, singleton infants
born in 1998 in Helsinki, Finland (16). Between 2009 and
2011, all 920 cohort members who had given permission
to be contacted and whose addresses were traceable were
invited to participate in a follow-up study; 692 (75.2%)
were contacted by phone, and 451 (65.2% of the women
who were contacted) participated.
Of the follow-up participants, 327 of the children were
prenatally exposed to zero–low maternal consumption
of glycyrrhizin (≤249 mg/week; mean = 47 mg/week)
and 51 to high maternal consumption (≥500 mg/week;
mean = 845 mg/week). They represented 48.0% (of 681)
and 56.7% (of 90) of those invited, respectively (P = 0.12
for difference in participation rates). The children were as-
sessed at follow-up visits held during 2009–2011. At the
follow-up visit, children exposed to zero–low amounts of
glycyrrhizin had a mean age of 12.5 (standard deviation
(SD), 0.4) years, and children exposed to high amounts of
glycyrrhizin had a mean age of 12.5 (SD, 0.4) years
(P = 0.26 for group difference). For girls, mean difference
(MD) for age in years was −0.15 (95% confidence inter-
val (CI): −0.32, 0.01) between the exposure groups; for
boys, MD = 0.04 (95% CI: −0.14, 0.21) between the
exposure groups. Among those exposed to zero–low and
high amounts of glycyrrhizin and who were invited
(n = 771), nonparticipation (n = 393) was related to older
maternal age (MD = 0.72 years, 95% CI: 0.03, 1.40),
higher level of maternal stress (on a 100-mm visual ana-
log scale, MD = 5.3 mm, 95% CI: 1.7, 9.0), and weekly
coffee consumption during pregnancy (MD = 1.3 cups/
week, 95% CI: 0.3, 2.4). However, it was not related to
the other 25 variables that we tested, including maternal
weekly licorice consumption, chocolate consumption,
cacao consumption, tea consumption, salt consumption,
alcohol consumption, smoking status, blood pressure dur-
ing pregnancy, maternal or paternal weight, maternal
height or body mass index (BMI) at delivery, or delivery
mode, nor was it related to the offspring’s birth order,
body size at birth, length of gestation, or Apgar score at 1
minute (P > 0.08 for all).
Due to this slightly differential dropout, we computed sta-
bilized inverse-probability-of-censoring weights (IPCWs) (19)
using the aforementioned characteristics associated with non-
participation. These IPCWs were subsequently included in all
statistical models in order to reduce the possibility of selection
bias affecting our results. The assumptions of positivity and
misspecification of the weights were checked as recom-
mended (20).
The study protocol was approved by the ethical committees
of the City of Helsinki and the Uusimaa Hospital District.
Written informed consent was obtained from the mothers after
delivery and from the parent/guardian and adolescent at the
follow-up assessment.
Maternal licorice consumption
While in the maternity ward, the mothers reported the
brand(s) and weekly consumption of licorice during preg-
nancy (glycyrrhizin intake calculated as mg/week), using a
list of all brands of licorice-containing confectionery avail-
able in Finland in 1998 (16). The list was prepared by the
National Food Administration in 1993 and updated with
information from manufacturers (16). The zero–low-expo-
sure (0–249 mg/week) and high-exposure (≥500 mg/week)
groups comprised 75 percent and 11 percent of births in
the initial cohort (16).

 Pubertal maturation
Estimation of pubertal maturation was based on 3 mea-
sures of growth and development. 1) The difference was
taken between the child’s height-for-age standard-deviation
score (21) (using the current measured height without shoes,
measured with a Seca stadiometer) (Model 213; Seca GmbH
& Co KG, Hamburg, Germany) and the standard-deviation
score of the midparental target height (22); this is a measure
of remaining growth potential and, consequently, the timing
of the pubertal growth spurt. 2) The Tanner staging ques-
tionnaire was administered by a research nurse; using sche-
matic drawings of 2 secondary sex characteristics (pubic
hair development in girls and boys and breast develop-
ment in girls or development of genitalia in boys), the
examiner derives two 5-stage scores ranging from prepu-
bertal (stage I) to postpubertal (stage V) (23). 3) The
Pubertal Development Scale is a self-report on secondary
sex characteristics (growth spurt, body hair that is not
specifically pubic hair, and skin changes in girls and
boys; menarche and breast development in girls; and
facial hair and voice change in boys) and yields one 4-
stage score ranging from no development (1) to full com-
pletion of development (4) (24).
We also measured weight in light clothing without shoes
(Model 8; Seca GmbH & Co KG) and calculated BMI
(weight (kg)/height (m)2). We transformed the values into
weight-for-age and BMI-for-age standard-deviation scores (21).
Cognition
The cognitive test battery comprised tests of intelligence,
memory and learning, social perception, attention, and
executive function. The short form of the Wechsler
Intelligence Scale for Children III (25) included vocabu-
lary, similarities, block design, and picture arrangement
subtests, for which we used age-standardized scores as well
as estimated age-standardized total intelligence and verbal
and performance intelligence quotients (IQs) (26). For the
Developmental Neuropsychological Assessment for children
(27), we used age-standardized scores for word generation,
design fluency, free and cued narrative memory, memory of
names, memory of faces, and theory of mind subtests.
Measures of attention and executive function included the
Continuous Performance Test II (28), the Trail Making Test
(29), and the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (30).
Psychiatric problems
Mothers completed the Child Behavior Checklist, a standard-
ized and validated rating scale screening for psychiatric pro-
blems (31). We calculated scores for the scales oriented to the
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth
Edition, and used the 82nd percentile as the cutoff to identify
adolescents with borderline clinically significant problems (31).
HPA-axis activity
Samples of saliva were collected using cotton swabs
(Salivette; Sarstedt, Nümbrecht, Germany). On the first of the
2 consecutive days, samples were collected upon awakening
and 15, 30, 45, and 60 minutes thereafter, at 12:00 noon, at
5:00 p.m., and at bedtime. Dexamethasone was administered
after the bedtime saliva sample, and a sample was collected
upon awakening the next day. We used a low dose of dexa-
methasone (3 µg/kg of total body weight) to attempt to detect
individual variation in HPA-axis suppression (32).
Salivary cortisol concentrations were determined by
solid-phase, time-resolved fluorescence immunoassay with
fluorometric end-point detection (DELFIA; Wallac, Turku,
Finland). The intraassay and interassay coefficients of vari-
ation varied between 4.0% and 7.7%, and the mean coeffi-
cient of variation between duplicate analyses was 5.9%.
Covariates and confounders
Covariates and confounders included the adolescent’s age
(years), highest educational level of either parent (secondary
or less, vocational, university) reported at follow-up, gesta-
tional length (weeks) as confirmed by ultrasonography, birth
weight (grams) of the adolescent as derived from birth re-
cords, maternal age (years) and BMI, calculated from weight
and height derived from medical records, maternal smoking
status (none, 1–10 cigarettes/day, >10 cigarettes/day), mater-
nal weekly alcohol consumption (no, yes, no answer; g/week
for those reporting yes), coffee consumption (cups/week), tea
consumption (cups/week), cacao consumption (cups/week),
salt consumption (no, yes, low-sodium), chocolate consump-
tion (never, seldom, weekly, daily), and stress (measured
using a 100-mm visual analog scale) during pregnancy, which
was reported while the mother was on the maternity ward.
They also included the adolescent’s own licorice consumption
(never, less than once a week, once a week, 2–4 days a week,
daily, no answer), reported in the follow-up assessment.
In addition, we conducted analyses of pubertal matura-
tion adjusting for maternal self-reported age at menarche
(years) as a crude proxy of the genetic component of
pubertal development and analyses of HPA-axis for time at
awakening and time at dexamethasone intake.
Statistical analyses
Differences between the zero–low- and high-exposure
groups in the continuous, categorical, and binary outcomes
were tested with and without covariates (described in the
Results section), using generalized linear models specifying a
Gaussian, ordinal logistic, or binary logistic reference distri-
bution for quantitative, ordinal, or binary responses, respec-
tively. All models were weighted by IPCW and computed
using robust estimators, which provides consistent covariance
estimates even in the case of misspecification of the variance
and link functions. By using this analytical strategy, we also
tested whether glycyrrhizin intake as a continuous variable
(natural log–transformed, to improve linear model fitting)—
among those who reported consumption of at least some
licorice—was associated in a dose-response manner with the
continuous, categorical, and binary outcomes. All P values
were 2-sided.
Analyses of pubertal development were conducted sepa-
rately in girls and boys because adolescent girls are, on

 average, ahead of boys in pubertal development. Other out-
comes were tested in girls and boys combined because sex ×
exposure-level group interactions were not significant in any
analyses (P values > 0.05).
RESULTS
The zero–low- and high-exposure groups did not differ
significantly in terms of any maternal, paternal, neonatal,
or adolescent background characteristics (P ≥ 0.07 for all;
Table 1).
Pubertal maturation
Table 2 shows that in models that did not adjust for co-
variates, girls in the high-exposure group had significantly
higher height-, weight-, and BMI-for-age standard-deviation
scores, and their current measured height-for-age standard-
deviation scores were closer to the standard-deviation scores
for midparental target height. They also reported a more
advanced Tanner stage of pubic hair and breast develop-
ment and a more advanced pubertal stage on the Pubertal
Development Scale than did girls in the zero–low-exposure
group. In models with covariate adjustment, the associations
remained significant except for height and height-for-age
standard-deviation score. Further, 41.4% (n = 12) of partici-
pants in the zero–low-exposure group and 58.6% (n = 17) in
the high-exposure group reported the occurrence of menarche
(P < 0.006 with IPCW, both with and without covariates).
Among boys in the high-exposure group, weight, weight-
for-age standard-deviation score, height, and height-for-age
standard-deviation score were lower, and the difference of cur-
rent measured height-for-age standard-deviation scores from
the standard-deviation scores for midparental target height
was higher than among boys in the zero–low-exposure group.
The group difference in weight did not survive covariate ad-
justments, and the groups did not differ in terms of other mar-
kers of pubertal maturation (Table 2).
Cognition
Adolescents in the high-exposure group scored signifi-
cantly lower on general, verbal, and performance IQ scales
and on word generation, design fluency, narrative memory,
and memory of faces compared with the zero–low-exposure
group (Table 3). Except for design fluency and narrative
memory, these differences were significant in models that
adjusted for covariates, and the results did not change sub-
stantially when we excluded children in special education
and/or with general estimated IQs of <70 age-standardized
points owing to problems in visual processing (n = 4 in the
zero–low-exposure group and n = 1 in the high-exposure
group) (Table 3). There were no significant group differ-
ences in the indices of executive function (Table 3).
Psychiatric problems
The odds of scoring above the borderline clinical cutoff on
the attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder problem scale were
significantly higher among adolescents in the high-exposure
group than among those in the zero–low-exposure group in
models with and without covariates (Table 4), and the odds
remained significant when we excluded adolescents with neu-
rocognitive deficits (n = 3 in zero–low-exposure group and
n = 1 in the high-exposure group) (Table 4). Web Table 1
(available at http://aje.oxfordjournals.org/) shows group dif-
ferences in the Child Behavior Checklist broadband and nar-
rowband scales.
HPA-axis activity
There were no significant group differences in HPA-axis
activity (Web Table 2).
Dose-response associations between glycyrrhizin
intake and outcomes
Web Tables 3–5 show dose-response associations between
the levels of glycyrrhizin consumed in licorice by the preg-
nant women and their adolescent children’s pubertal matura-
tion, cognition scores, and psychiatric problems. These tests
were conducted among those who reported consuming at
least some licorice during pregnancy (range of glycyrrhizin
content in consumed licorice was 10–2,464 mg/week;
n = 159). Sample size varied slightly by outcome and is re-
ported in the Web Tables. These findings largely replicate
the exposure-level group differences.
DISCUSSION
Girls whose mothers consumed high amounts of licorice
during pregnancy showed more advanced pubertal matura-
tion at age 12 years than did girls whose mothers con-
sumed none or low amounts. On average, these girls were
more than 3 cm taller (0.4 SD taller for age and 0.5 SD
closer to their expected adult target height). This probably
reflects an earlier pubertal growth spurt and less remaining
growth potential. They were also 8 kg heavier (0.6 SD
heavier in weight for age) and had BMIs that were 2.2
higher (0.6 SD higher BMI for age), which could be a
cause or a consequence of their more advanced matura-
tional stage. There were no consistent associations between
maternal
licorice
consumption
during
pregnancy
and
pubertal maturation in boys at this age.
These findings extend previous human studies showing
that low birth weight and preterm birth, proxies of prenatal
environmental adversity, predict earlier onset of pubertal
maturation in girls and/or boys (33). Our findings also cor-
roborate results derived from animal models of glucocorti-
coid overexposure showing altered timing of pubertal
maturation in the exposed offspring (13).
Collection of blood samples for testing of hypothalamic-
pituitary-gonadal axis or adrenal androgen parameters was
not feasible in the current study. It remains unclear whether
earlier hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis maturation and in-
crease in adrenal androgen production underlie the advanced
pubertal stage of the female offspring exposed to high
maternal consumption of licorice during pregnancy. We did

 not find any differences in basal diurnal HPA-axis patterns.
Although this might be likely to contrast with our previous
report in this cohort at an earlier age (18), our prior observa-
tions reflected mainly peak HPA-axis responses to psychoso-
cial stress, which we did not test this time. Also, at puberty,
the substantial individual differences in maturation often
mask more subtle HPA-axis differences.
When compared with the zero–low-exposure group, both
adolescent girls and boys in the high-exposure group had
IQ test scores more than 7 age-standardized points (more
than 0.5 SD in an IQ test with mean = 100 (SD, 15)) lower
for estimated general, verbal, and performance IQ, and
they fared worse on tests measuring verbal productivity
and memory. They also had more than 3-fold greater odds
of attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder problems. These
findings are in agreement with findings from glucocorticoid
overexposure animal models (7–13) and our earlier find-
ings in children from this cohort at a prepubertal age (17).
Thus, these detrimental cognitive and neuropsychiatric out-
comes following high maternal licorice consumption per-
sist into early adolescence.
The detrimental associations of high maternal licorice con-
sumption with offspring cognition and behavior were wide-
spread, including the domains of general intelligence, language,
memory, visuospatial processing, and behavioral and inatten-
tion problems, suggesting fairly widespread brain dysfunction.
The limbic system may be a key target—particularly the hip-
pocampus, which is involved in regulation of various cognitive
processes, emotion, and behavior and is sensitive to early-life
glucocorticoid manipulations (7–13). However, executive
function was unaffected, suggesting that “higher-level” cogni-
tive functioning resists prenatal glucocorticoid exposure.

Licorice During Pregnancy and Child Outcomes

Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/aje/article-abstract/185/5/317/2967089 by guest on 01 June 2019
 Limitations of our study include, first, that we measured
average weekly consumption levels of glycyrrhizin during
pregnancy and consumption of licorice confectionery only.
Hence, we could not determine the level of glycyrrhizin con-
sumed per dose of licorice, how much the consumed doses
varied during gestation, or whether glycyrrhizin exposure had
a “critical window” for adverse associations. One double-
blind, randomized, controlled study in 39 healthy female vol-
unteers showed that the “no observed adverse effect level”
for the effect of glycyrrhizin on plasma volume expansion
(suppression of plasma renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system
and increase in body weight) and electrolyte concentrations
(decline in plasma potassium and rise in bicarbonate con-
centrations) is 2 mg/kg body weight (34). In our sample, the
average weekly glycyrrhizin content (per kg body weight at
delivery) in licorice products consumed was 2.3 mg/kg body
weight (range, 0–4.5 mg/week) in the zero–low-exposure
group and 13.7 mg/kg body weight (range, 6.4–41.4 mg/
week) in the high-exposure group. While we cannot draw
conclusions about placental 11β-HSD2 function from these
findings, and we are not aware of studies that have tested
whether there is a similar “no observed adverse effect level”
of glycyrrhizin on placental 11β-HSD2, our ex vivo dual-
perfusion-method study of fresh, intact, term placentas showed
that even very low doses of glycyrrhizin potently inhibit the
placental glucocorticoid barrier function (9). Because the asso-
ciations between maternal glycyrrhizin intake and pubertal mat-
uration in girls and cognition and attention deficit/hyperactivity
disorder problems in both girls and boys were linear, it ap-
pears that no safe exposure during human pregnancy exists.

 These linear associations should, however, be interpreted
with caution and confirmed in future studies specifically de-
signed to test dose-response associations. Our observational
study was designed primarily to test differences in pubertal,
cognitive, and psychiatric outcomes between the zero–low-
exposure and high-exposure groups.
Second, glycyrrhizin is also added to other food prod-
ucts, including candy, chewing gum, cookies, ice creams,
syrups, herbal tea, alcoholic and nonalcoholic beverages,
and traditional and herbal medicine. We were unable to
determine consumption of other glycyrrhizin-containing
products. However, according to the US Food and Drug
Administration (35), the maximum allowable level of gly-
cyrrhizin in foods is 16% for hard candy and 3.1% for soft
candy, whereas the maximum allowable levels in other
foods vary from 0.05% to 0.15%. This suggests that the
main source of glycyrrhizin is licorice.
Third, we measured pubertal maturation in cross-section
and thus could not determine pubertal timing. In addition,
stage of puberty was self-reported. While self-ratings have
been challenged for being inaccurate (36), there is also evi-
dence suggesting good concordance of the Tanner staging
questionnaire and the Pubertal Development Scale with
physicians’ ratings (37).
Fourth, our cohort comprised singleton, healthy babies,
thus resulting in a lower prevalence of common pregnancy
disorders in our sample than in the general population.
This may limit generalizability from the findings to popula-
tions with higher postnatal morbidity. We cannot determine
the extent to which our findings generalize to countries
where licorice is not as commonly consumed. Yet, even in
the United States, where licorice consumption is not com-
mon, the average daily consumption of glycyrrhizin can be
up to 215.2 mg (38), suggesting widespread exposure
beyond ostensible licorice products.
Fifth, we were able to adjust for a range of potential con-
founders, including maternal education as a proxy for mater-
nal intelligence; this did not substantially affect our main
findings. Neither did we find differences between the groups
in any maternal, paternal, neonatal, or adolescent background
characteristics. However, we cannot exclude the possibility
that some unmeasured dietary and/or behavioral factor associ-
ated with maternal licorice consumption may in part explain
our findings. Finally, we cannot address the possibility of
selection bias resulting from sample attrition beyond the
method of IPCW (19).
Our findings, which varied in effect size from small to
large, are comparable to the effects of self-reported maternal
binge drinking during pregnancy on poorer cognition
(Cohen’s d = −0.13) and greater behavioral problems
(Cohen’s d = −0.15) in the offspring (39). Prevention of
alcohol use during pregnancy is a public health priority (40).

a We calculated scores for the DSM-IV–oriented scales and used the 82nd percentile as the cutoff to identify adolescents with borderline clin-
ically significant psychiatric problems. In the zero–low-exposure group, 41 children had missing data on the problem scales. In the high-
exposure group, 9 had missing data on problem scales.
b P values (2-sided) correspond to tests for differences between zero–low- and high-exposure groups (generalized linear models weighted
by IPCW and specifying binary logistic reference distribution for binary outcomes).
c P values (2-sided) correspond to tests for differences between zero–low- and high-exposure groups (generalized linear models weighted
by IPCW and specifying binary logistic reference distribution for dichotomous outcomes) when adolescents in special education and/or with
general estimated IQ <70 age-standardized points owing to problems in visual processing are excluded (n = 3 and 1 in zero–low- and high-
exposure groups, respectively) .
d P values (2-sided) correspond to tests for differences between zero–low- and high-exposure groups (generalized linear models weighted
by IPCW and specifying binary logistic reference distribution for binary outcomes) adjusted for sex, age at 12.5 years, maternal age and body
mass index at delivery, smoking status, alcohol consumption, coffee consumption, tea consumption, cacao consumption, salt consumption,
chocolate consumption, and stress during pregnancy and for the adolescent’s birth weight by sex, gestational length, highest educational level
of either parent, and adolescent’s licorice consumption at age 12.5 years.

 We are limited in drawing causal conclusions; however,
as with ethanol, there are clear mechanistic grounds for sus-
pecting that glycyrrhizin—a potent 11β-HSD2 inhibitor (the
affinity the inhibitor has for the enzyme is high)—may be
harmful in pregnancy (8, 9). Nutritional recommendations of
various expert organizations do not mention glycyrrhizin
use during pregnancy (35, 41, 42). The present findings
suggest that pregnant women should be informed that con-
sumption of licorice and other food products containing gly-
cyrrhizin may be associated with harm for their developing
offspring.
